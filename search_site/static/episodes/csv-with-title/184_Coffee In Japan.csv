00:00;00:06;"It's 2022, and it's not just the 30th anniversary of Alice in Chains' Dirt."
00:06;00:08;"We'll also be talking about Tully's,"
00:08;00:16;"The Coffee Chain, plus Jake's favorite band, Second Grade."
00:16;00:21;"All that, plus Marquis Moon by Television."
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:16;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:16;01:18;"Good morning, sir."
01:18;01:22;"Good morning. Very early for me over here."
01:22;01:23;"What time is it?"
01:23;01:29;"7 a.m. Probably some people don't think that's that early, but for me, that's very early to be"
01:29;01:30;"up and at them."
01:30;01:34;"That's early to start a radio show. This is like morning drive time style."
01:34;01:38;"This might be the earliest I've ever done Time Crisis."
01:38;01:42;"Oh, I think so. I don't think we've never done it this early in the States."
01:42;01:47;"But I like to think about you last night, around 6 p.m., like, ""I got to hit the hay."
01:47;01:48;"I got to work in the morning."""
01:48;01:53;"You have those insane morning drive time hours where they're getting up at 2 to go to work."
01:53;01:55;"I mean, that's crossed my mind before."
01:55;02:01;"It's especially funny because there's a lot of people who have to wake up early for work,"
02:01;02:07;"but then you throw in the showbiz element where it's like, ""I got to be up and at them."
02:07;02:11;"I got to be radio ready at 5.30."""
02:11;02:12;"Yeah."
02:12;02:17;"I wonder if you're the family of some drive time radio person."
02:17;02:18;"Do you have your own bedroom?"
02:18;02:21;"Howard Stern talks about this all the time."
02:21;02:26;"He goes to bed. He eats dinner at 5.30, and he is in bed by 8, 8.30."
02:26;02:32;"He has his own bed, and I think he talks about how his family's always been just really miserable."
02:32;02:37;"I mean, that's him, who I think would make others suffer."
02:37;02:38;"Yeah, that's kind of like..."
02:38;02:44;"And also, that's his shtick to be like, ""It's totally insane. I'm a freak. I drive everybody"
02:44;02:45;"crazy."""
02:45;02:50;"There's something about you telling Rashida and the family, ""Guys, I want everybody quiet"
02:50;02:52;"around 8.30. I have to wake up to do Time Crisis."""
02:52;02:57;"Earlier, ""I need a 12-hour window."""
02:57;02:57;"Yeah, exactly."
02:57;03:02;"""At 7 p.m., we'll go on library rolls. I don't want to hear a peep above a whisper."
03:02;03:04;"I got to be ready to do the radio."""
03:05;03:11;"Whereas you guys are sitting pretty there mid-afternoon yesterday in Los Angeles."
03:11;03:12;"3 p.m., baby."
03:12;03:13;"Love it."
03:23;03:25;"It's oh so still."
03:25;03:33;"Shh, shh, you're all alone."
03:33;03:39;"Shh, shh, and so peaceful until..."
03:40;03:43;"You fall in love."
03:43;03:44;"Sinful."
03:44;03:46;"The sky up above."
03:46;03:48;"Sinful."
03:48;03:50;"It's caving in."
03:50;03:52;"[Screaming]"
03:52;03:56;"You've never been so nuts about a guy you wanna love."
03:56;03:58;"You wanna cry, you cross your heart and hope to die."
03:58;04:01;"'Til it's over."
04:01;04:05;"One thing I wanted to start with, just speaking of being in Japan,"
04:05;04:09;"have we ever talked about the Tully's coffee chain?"
04:09;04:09;"No."
04:09;04:12;"So I wanted to talk about it because it's very ubiquitous here, and"
04:12;04:15;"I've been drinking a lot of Tully's coffee, actually."
04:15;04:19;"And it's one of... There's something funny about, especially in Tokyo,"
04:19;04:23;"it's a big cosmopolitan international city, so unsurprisingly,"
04:23;04:29;"you're gonna have a lot of the same stuff that you have in every big western city."
04:29;04:34;"Of course, you have the giant global chains, McDonald's, Starbucks."
04:34;04:38;"We've discussed how there's, you know, can be the slight regional differences."
04:38;04:42;"By the way, I never actually got the sweet potato frappuccino here."
04:42;04:44;"Sold out everywhere."
04:44;04:48;"I've noticed as I walk past a lot of Starbucks, they slapped a big sold out sign on it."
04:48;04:49;"Is that sign in English?"
04:49;04:50;"Yes."
04:50;04:53;"Yeah, it's usually sold out in English."
04:53;04:53;"All right."
04:53;04:55;"I don't know if you have some insight."
04:55;05:01;"I've never truly been able to understand how much stuff is in English here."
05:01;05:07;"People want to project a kind of cool international flavor by putting your sign in English."
05:07;05:09;"I can't totally follow the logic."
05:09;05:12;"I mean, it's useful being an English speaking person here, how much stuff is in English."
05:12;05:14;"But yeah, then sometimes it's only in English."
05:14;05:18;"Sometimes you'll hear some J-pop songs and a few lines will just be in English."
05:18;05:20;"Just for the sort of aesthetic."
05:20;05:20;"Right."
05:20;05:25;"And then famously, you have the aesthetic English t-shirts all over the world."
05:25;05:27;"That's a two way street."
05:27;05:32;"Of course, you walk around Japan, let alone, you know, any other country where you'll see"
05:32;05:35;"some grandma wearing a shirt that says like, I haven't seen any."
05:35;05:38;"I haven't seen anything quite as crazy as you."
05:38;05:42;"But you just see the kind of like, OK, now listen up."
05:42;05:43;"I'm number one."
05:43;05:46;"And if you don't understand, that's on fire."
05:47;05:50;"I've seen some of that stuff, which, of course, is a two way street."
05:50;05:56;"Famously, there are many Americans with a tattoo, Japanese characters that says something"
05:56;05:57;"nonsensical."
05:57;06:00;"But sold out isn't communicating an aesthetic."
06:00;06:02;"It's telling you."
06:02;06:08;"So someone, the Japanese have to be able to understand that English language phrase."
06:08;06:12;"I suspect it's an Anglicism that is recognizable."
06:12;06:14;"That's that's I think I think it's one of those."
06:14;06:18;"Right. Like it's possible that something based on sold out."
06:18;06:19;"There's like a Japanese version."
06:19;06:20;"Yeah."
06:20;06:25;"Or it's a discriminatory policy where it's only sold out for foreigners."
06:25;06:26;"Oh, for the gaijin."
06:26;06:27;"Yeah."
06:27;06:32;"Oh, well, OK, I'm going to have to do some investigative journalism then."
06:32;06:34;"Just walk into Japanese Starbucks."
06:34;06:35;"Hey, excuse me."
06:35;06:36;"I noticed it said sold out."
06:36;06:38;"They're like, hmm."
06:38;06:39;"Yes, sorry, it's sold out."
06:39;06:43;"Then Japanese person goes in with the flawless Japanese."
06:44;06:46;"They walk right out with a sweet potato Frappuccino."
06:46;06:48;"It's possible."
06:48;06:50;"But anyway, I was saying, you know, there's so many."
06:50;06:55;"Obviously, there's so many Western chains here, at least in Tokyo and Tokyo might be,"
06:55;06:59;"you know, a bit exceptional, but there's it's so much deeper than just McDonald's and Starbucks."
06:59;07:02;"There's Denny's, Carl's Jr."
07:02;07:05;"There's even like one Shakey's pizza."
07:05;07:08;"There's Krispy Kreme."
07:08;07:10;"There's all that stuff."
07:10;07:17;"But then there's this other phenomenon, which is American chains that no longer exist in America."
07:17;07:22;"And that's interesting because there is there is a funny thing I've been feeling being in Japan"
07:22;07:28;"for a while now of there's something about commerce that feels pleasantly old school,"
07:28;07:33;"even in a big city like Tokyo."
07:33;07:40;"People use cash and coins so much more here than I find in New York or L.A.,"
07:40;07:41;"which is kind of pleasantly old school."
07:41;07:46;"And there's something about I don't know, the department stores feel more vibrant"
07:46;07:49;"in a way, almost like it's still the mid 90s."
07:49;07:52;"There's just something kind of like 90s about the commerce."
07:52;07:57;"So anyway, there's a few of these chains that died in the U.S."
07:57;08:00;"that I'm not going to say they're thriving in Japan, but they're like holding on."
08:01;08:06;"So one, I mean, this is a pretty New York one, but you know, Dean and DeLuca,"
08:06;08:09;"you ever hit that jig back in your in your brief New York days?"
08:09;08:11;"Maybe once or twice. Sure. I'm familiar."
08:11;08:14;"So for anybody who doesn't know, because it's a bit regional,"
08:14;08:18;"Dean and DeLuca was like, I think, starting in the early 80s,"
08:18;08:26;"like Basquiat era downtown New York, Soho was this kind of new school gourmet supermarket."
08:26;08:28;"It was around for a long time."
08:28;08:32;"It moved locations, but there's always there's this big one in Soho."
08:32;08:38;"And it was kind of like the epitome of that era of New York's kind of a high ceiling,"
08:38;08:43;"old Soho building with food from around the world, really nice,"
08:43;08:48;"like Italian imports and good pre-made food, good coffee,"
08:48;08:51;"you know, kind of like a cool New York grocery store."
08:51;08:53;"I grew up next to one in Washington, D.C."
08:53;08:54;"They had one in D.C.?"
08:54;08:56;"OK, maybe it's not quite as regional as I think."
08:56;08:59;"And I think it expanded. I think it was there."
08:59;09:03;"It was I think you see them a lot now, whether it's a cookbook or something."
09:03;09:08;"I know it's bigger, but it was like to me that first, like you said, gourmet grocer."
09:08;09:09;"Yeah."
09:09;09:10;"Food prep place."
09:10;09:14;"They were killing it. Late 20th century, East Coast America."
09:14;09:15;"They were doing their thing."
09:15;09:16;"Know it well."
09:16;09:22;"I'm all lost in the supermarket. I can no longer shop happily."
09:22;09:28;"I came in here for a special offer. Guaranteed personality."
09:28;09:35;"I wasn't born so much as I fell out. Nobody seemed to notice me."
09:35;09:42;"We had a hedge back home in the suburb over which I never could see."
09:43;09:47;"I heard the people who live on the ceiling scream and fight."
09:47;09:53;"Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling."
09:53;09:55;"That's how it's been all around me."
09:55;10:01;"I'm all lost in the supermarket. I can no longer shop happily."
10:01;10:08;"I came in here for a special offer. Guaranteed personality."
10:08;10:12;"And then eventually they started having just like little cafes that, you know,"
10:12;10:16;"was not like a whole grocery store, but yeah, more or less like a"
10:16;10:21;"Starbucks with maybe slightly more junk you could buy, cookies and stuff."
10:21;10:26;"But they did their thing. I'm sure at some point, private equity got in the mix and"
10:26;10:32;"wanted to expand. Because on the one hand, you're kind of like, how did it go so wrong?"
10:32;10:36;"You had this kind of like iconic downtown New York, little market."
10:37;10:42;"Even the last time I went to the Soho one, always jammed with people."
10:42;10:46;"How did that fall apart? And almost always, I'm not even going to double check."
10:46;10:47;"Yeah, yeah. That's not even there anymore."
10:47;10:50;"Dean and DeLucas is out in the US."
10:50;10:53;"The original Soho one is not there. It essentially doesn't exist in the US."
10:53;11:00;"There's a handful of cafes still around. The big market doesn't exist."
11:00;11:04;"And maybe Seinfeld, can we get a number crunch? It's a classic story where basically"
11:04;11:12;"a beloved institution gets infused with money, maybe sold, expands, cannot hold the territory."
11:12;11:16;"Yeah, the soul's been ripped out."
11:16;11:21;"The soul's been ripped out. The forward operating bases are in hostile territory."
11:21;11:27;"They're not getting support from the mothership. And then the whole empire collapses."
11:27;11:32;"Yeah, they filed for bankruptcy in 2020, Chapter 11 protection,"
11:32;11:36;"liabilities, 500 million, assets of under 50 million."
11:36;11:40;"When they filed, they were owned by Thailand's Pace Development Corp."
11:40;11:44;"They're headquartered in Wichita, Kansas."
11:44;11:45;"Oh my God."
11:45;11:51;"Wait, what? It's a Thailand X Kansas collab?"
11:51;11:58;"They originated in Kansas. It got acquired at some point by a Thai company called Pace"
11:58;11:59;"Development."
11:59;12:02;"Wait, what originated in Kansas? Dean and DeLuca?"
12:02;12:03;"Dean and DeLuca."
12:03;12:04;"No, wait, wait, wait."
12:04;12:09;"It's an American, here, according to Wikipedia, it's an American chain of upscale grocery stores."
12:09;12:15;"We know that. The first one established in Soho by Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca and Jack"
12:15;12:22;"Sealdrick in '77. And then they were joined in '79 by Eugenio Botellini."
12:22;12:27;"I love that it's '77. This like incredibly important year for like American punk rock"
12:27;12:28;"and Dean and DeLuca."
12:28;12:29;"Yep."
12:29;12:33;"I mean, I'm not trying to be crass, but like these art and commerce, they go hand in hand."
12:33;12:34;"That makes so much sense."
12:34;12:42;"1977, downtown New York, Dean and DeLuca, Talking Head '77, Marquee Moon, television."
12:42;12:49;"That's sophisticated rock for college educated people."
12:49;12:52;"Okay, but the HQ, HQ is in Wichita."
12:52;12:53;"Yes."
12:53;12:54;"Wichita, Kansas."
12:54;12:56;"That must've been, yeah, why, at some point-"
12:56;12:57;"That's part of the restructuring."
12:57;13:04;"That was like a Wichita based private equity firm came out and bought up Dean and DeLuca."
13:04;13:06;"I mean, I respect that. The heartland strikes back."
13:06;13:13;"I'm still in a dream of 1977 where I've just picked up Marquee Moon on vinyl down the street,"
13:13;13:19;"and I'm popping by Dean and DeLuca's to pick, to hit that olive bar, maybe get some Buffalo"
13:19;13:28;"mozzarella with a really nice freshly baked loaf of rosemary sourdough."
13:28;13:29;"Oh, I can totally picture it."
13:29;13:36;"I'm having people over that night, got some nice wine, throwing that television record."
13:36;13:40;"Just the epitome of a sophisticated downtown New Yorker."
13:40;13:40;"Yeah."
13:40;13:44;"You could be 20 something, could be even early 30s."
13:45;13:52;"Just listening to the book I read by Talking Heads, making a really nice salad with some"
13:52;13:59;"extra virgin olive oil that you picked up at Dean and DeLuca, having a sophisticated loft party."
13:59;14:01;"Arguing about Annie Hall."
14:01;14:04;"Yep. Annie Hall's in theaters. Damn, that's a big era for New York."
14:04;14:11;"I'm writing about the book I read. I have to sing about the book I read."
14:11;14:15;"I'm embarrassed to admit it hit the soft spot in my heart when"
14:15;14:23;"I found out you wrote the book I read. So I'll take my shoulders and then touch your heart."
14:23;14:31;"I'm a little cautious but I feel alright. The book I read was in your eyes."
14:32;14:36;"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, oh."
14:36;14:42;"I'm living in the future. I feel wonderful."
14:42;14:46;"I'm tipping over backwards. I'm so ambitious."
14:46;14:51;"I'm looking back. I'm running a race and you're the book I read."
14:51;14:59;"So feel my fingers as they touch your heart. I'm not spinning around and I feel alright."
14:59;15:04;"The book I read was in your eyes."
15:04;15:09;"Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
15:09;15:13;"I feel like I'd be depressed if we looked it up, but I bet you could probably do some"
15:13;15:22;"similar things to kind of like our era of New York, like 2008, 2009. I wonder what kind of like"
15:22;15:23;"stores started."
15:23;15:25;"I hit that whole food in Union Square."
15:25;15:28;"Well, yeah, maybe it's just not as fun. It's like..."
15:28;15:30;"Oh yeah, what stores started like..."
15:30;15:34;"In 2009, the year Bitta Orca and..."
15:34;15:35;"Contra?"
15:35;15:36;"Well, Contra..."
15:36;15:36;"Contra's 10."
15:36;15:37;"We're on different years."
15:37;15:41;"You picked up Contra and you went to the first Sweet Greens."
15:41;15:43;"There could be something like that."
15:43;15:47;"Yeah, are there any chains that emerged out of Brooklyn, out of that Brooklyn,"
15:47;15:54;"like peak Brooklyn circa whatever, '09? Are there any, like even on a small level, like..."
15:54;15:58;"Oh, like Five Leaves. There's one in... It's not a chain, but there's a Five Leaves."
15:58;16:02;"There's kind of a Five Leaves in LA. Yeah, see, there's these smaller chains. I mean,"
16:02;16:05;"I don't know when it started. It's not Brooklyn, but you know, there's this,"
16:05;16:08;"there's a New York restaurant, Jack's Wife Frida."
16:08;16:10;"Yeah, I actually went there last time I was in New York."
16:10;16:12;"That's funny, Jake, because..."
16:12;16:13;"Soho."
16:13;16:19;"I had lunch at Jack's Wife Frida Roppongi in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago."
16:19;16:22;"Wow. I didn't know they had that far of a reach."
16:22;16:29;"I think there's like six Jack's Wife Fridas, three in New York and like three in Tokyo."
16:29;16:34;"So, you know, it's not the market penetration of like a Starbucks where you could probably be like"
16:34;16:39;"in like the jungle somewhere and find like a Starbucks at the airport."
16:39;16:43;"Sometimes I think you find these places that, you know, where there's like seven of them."
16:43;16:43;"Yeah."
16:43;16:47;"And you're like, ""Whoa, all over the world."" And really it's like, well, yeah,"
16:47;16:50;"one person opened a few in Tokyo, one person opened a few in New York, one person opened"
16:50;16:56;"one in London, which is like cosmopolitan in a sense, but also kind of a small slice of the world."
16:56;17:00;"But anyway, the reason I brought up Dine and Deluca is that it's one of these things where"
17:00;17:07;"I remember going whenever it was a few years ago when the big iconic Soho one closed."
17:07;17:10;"I just remember going in there and it was a little bit depressing because, you know,"
17:10;17:16;"they're trying to sell the last of their goods for bargain basement prices."
17:16;17:23;"So, like the last week of Dine and Deluca, you'd go in and obviously they're not ordering more"
17:23;17:29;"avocados and persimmons or whatever. So, all those shelves are empty and then they're still"
17:29;17:37;"trying to sell the last cooking supply, cooking wares, spatulas and stuff, some Italian flour."
17:37;17:40;"So, it was getting emptier and emptier. It was kind of depressing."
17:40;17:42;"But then I don't know how many there are in Japan."
17:42;17:43;"50."
17:43;17:43;"Wow."
17:43;17:47;"There's quite a few and some of them are just cafes, but then some of them,"
17:47;17:52;"none of them are as big as the Soho one, but some of them are little markets."
17:52;17:58;"I've been to one that had that kind of like late 20th century cornucopia feeling of like going"
17:58;18:03;"into Dine and Deluca and there's like so many bougie products spilling everywhere in a big"
18:03;18:10;"kind of deli hot bar where they're making all this nice stuff and wine and all those things."
18:10;18:16;"And at least in Tokyo, maybe I might just notice it the most because I speak English and I know"
18:16;18:22;"the Dine and Deluca logo. I also just notice young urban professionals with a little Dine"
18:22;18:27;"and Deluca tote bag quite a bit just walking the streets. So, it's an example of one of these"
18:27;18:32;"things that are at 50 stores, that's pretty good in Japan where something essentially tanked in"
18:32;18:36;"the US. And I think there may be literally, I think in New York, there might just be like one"
18:36;18:42;"little Dine and Deluca cafe left somewhere in the lobby of a building or something, but then in Japan"
18:42;18:48;"it's still thriving. So, there's quite a few of these things where a chain basically ended in the"
18:48;18:53;"US and still lives here. Like they still have a Toys R Us in Japan. I don't know enough to say"
18:53;18:59;"if it's like thriving, but I have stepped foot inside a Toys R Us in Japan, which I believe"
18:59;19:05;"there's zero left in the US, right? It's one of those kind of seer situations where it's sort of"
19:05;19:09;"like, are there seers? I think there are still some seers. I think there's-"
19:09;19:10;"Like I heard it went out of business."
19:10;19:15;"Yeah. It's been restructured like a dozen times. I feel like there probably are some"
19:15;19:18;"Toys R Us, but I could be wrong. It might be all gone."
19:18;19:22;"There may be one in Times Square. I don't think they shut that one down."
19:22;19:23;"Did they shut it down?"
19:23;19:24;"I don't know."
19:24;19:26;"Matt's shaking his head. I don't know."
19:26;19:26;"It's a Halloween square."
19:26;19:28;"We're on the edge of our seat here."
19:28;19:33;"Is there a Toys R Us? While we number crunch if there's a Toys R Us, this is a little Dine"
19:33;19:38;"and DeLuca tidbit that I find interesting. When you said, trying to think of stories of our time,"
19:38;19:41;"I was like, ""Oh, at least in Los Angeles, Air One is a very big deal."""
19:41;19:42;"Sure."
19:42;19:47;"And I think, ""Oh, what if that was something that came up around 2009?"" I looked it up"
19:47;19:49;"and it turns out, first of all-"
19:49;19:50;"Oh, Air One's from the 70s."
19:50;19:56;"It was founded in 1980. But this is interesting. The current CEO, Tony"
19:56;20:04;"Antoche, bought the company in 2011 after initially looking into being a Dine and DeLuca franchisee."
20:04;20:05;"Whoa."
20:05;20:05;"Okay."
20:05;20:06;"Oh, I love that."
20:06;20:10;"And he said, ""Hey, you know what? That's not going to fly. I see the end of that."
20:10;20:11;"I see the horizon line on that."""
20:11;20:18;"I'd love to talk to this guy. And also just for our listeners who don't live within the New York,"
20:18;20:25;"LA axis of evil, Air One is still, I believe, only in LA. And just like Dine and DeLuca,"
20:26;20:34;"represented this downtown New York, sophisticated, Annie Hall, Marquis Moon sensibility in '77,"
20:34;20:39;"Air One... Okay. I thought it was starting in the '70s. It started in 1980. I'm aware of Air One,"
20:39;20:45;"people in my life who grew up in LA. Air One at first was a hippie place, a cool hippie market"
20:45;20:49;"that represented... There were many of those from the '60s."
20:49;20:51;"The natural foods movement."
20:51;20:55;"Yeah. The natural foods movement, LA hippie stuff. I feel like Rashida told me they used"
20:55;20:58;"to have hay on the floor or something. It was funky."
20:58;21:01;"Where was the original Air One?"
21:01;21:06;"I don't think it was all that far from the one on Beverly now. I think it was roughly in that"
21:06;21:13;"Hollywood, West Hollywood vibe. And Air One is named after that novel. It's not quite"
21:13;21:18;"nowhere backwards, but it's something about a utopian ideal. So anyway, just like Dine and"
21:18;21:23;"DeLuca represented a New York vibe, Air One represented an LA vibe. And then as the years"
21:23;21:28;"went on, Air One kept up with the times. It didn't stay with that stuffy old hippie thing."
21:28;21:34;"It became the new LA, green juice, smoothies, that turbocharged..."
21:34;21:35;"Expensive."
21:35;21:37;"Yeah. Hippie means expensive."
21:37;21:39;"Yeah. According to Air One..."
21:39;21:44;"AirOneMarket.com says their first location was actually in Boston."
21:44;21:45;"Oh, really?"
21:45;21:46;"It was just a stall."
21:46;21:47;"A stall?"
21:47;21:48;"A 10 by 20..."
21:48;21:49;"Like in a farmer's market?"
21:49;21:54;"Like farmer's market style, but they're claiming that that's the first location,"
21:54;21:56;"first store of its kind in America."
21:56;22:02;"Let me guess, a young man went to Harvard or BU or Berkeley School of Music,"
22:02;22:07;"was really into natural foods, started a stall, getting a little bit of traction,"
22:07;22:11;"but he had this feeling like he wasn't getting enough respect from the mass holes."
22:11;22:19;"He's like, I just don't see my utopian vision for a natural foods kind of a market thriving in"
22:19;22:20;"Boston."
22:20;22:22;"I mean, close."
22:22;22:24;"He got out a map and said..."
22:24;22:26;"Go West, young man."
22:26;22:27;"I want to go West."
22:27;22:33;"I mean, in a bit of a full circle moment, the co-founder of Air One is actually Japanese,"
22:33;22:38;"was a teacher who advocated for macrobiotic diets and world peace."
22:38;22:41;"Avaline Kushi is her name."
22:41;22:47;"And it actually says on Wikipedia that she opened it in Brookline, Massachusetts in the 60s."
22:48;22:49;"A lot to unpack there."
22:49;22:50;"Keep going."
22:50;22:51;"I'm on the edge of my seat."
22:51;22:52;"Yeah."
22:52;22:58;"Kushi promoted the macrobiotic philosophy and diet, a Taoist influenced spiritual practice"
22:58;23:00;"emphasizing organic and seasonal foods."
23:00;23:05;"She was born in Yokota, Japan, worked as a schoolteacher until the end of World War II."
23:05;23:12;"So she must have been pretty old when she moved the operation to LA in 80."
23:12;23:14;"She would have been 67."
23:14;23:15;"Wow."
23:15;23:16;"Respect."
23:16;23:17;"Weight, 57."
23:17;23:19;"Yeah, it is funny to think."
23:19;23:20;"I feel like there's other stories like this."
23:20;23:27;"You think about the Boston area probably being a hotbed in the 60s of left-wing politics with"
23:27;23:30;"all these universities there."
23:30;23:36;"So of course, you're going to have like cool, vibrant, progressive cultural institutions"
23:36;23:38;"and even like supermarkets starting there."
23:38;23:46;"And obviously, a lot of these people eventually moved to a place like LA, a newer city."
23:47;23:48;"Go West."
23:48;23:51;"You know, the American imagination running free."
23:51;23:54;"That's where you can really start something new."
23:54;23:58;"It's not like Boston is-- obviously, Boston's this like very liberal place."
23:58;24:00;"These places have made their mark."
24:00;24:04;"But yeah, it just makes sense that there are probably so many people there who in the 60s"
24:04;24:07;"were like, yeah, yeah, I love the Boston area."
24:07;24:08;"And eventually, these people end up in LA."
24:08;24:12;"The renowned health food restaurant, Boston Market."
24:12;24:14;"Yeah, exactly."

25:32;25:36;"in 2011 looking at the New York versus LA markets"
25:36;25:41;"and being like, all right, I've got $350 million to invest."
25:41;25:43;"On the one hand, I see Dean and DeLuca,"
25:43;25:46;"Annie Hall, Marky Moon vibes."
25:46;25:47;"I feel like that already kind of,"
25:47;25:48;"that already had its revival,"
25:48;25:50;"kind of came and went in the early 2000s."
25:50;25:54;"On the other hand, I see Erewhon,"
25:54;25:57;"this kind of old LA hippie thing"
25:57;25:59;"that seems to be revitalized"
25:59;26:03;"with this kind of West Hollywood Kardashian"
26:03;26:06;"$20 smoothie thing."
26:06;26:07;"The choice is clear."
26:07;26:10;"I'm betting big on the $20 juices"
26:10;26:12;"that Marky Moon played out, dog."
26:12;26:15;"- I mean, what's the band that corresponds"
26:15;26:17;"to Erewhon in 1980?"
26:17;26:19;"I mean, I want to say Fleetwood Mac,"
26:19;26:21;"but they're doing too much Coke."
26:21;26:22;"- I mean, in a way."
26:22;26:24;"- Or like some like new age musician,"
26:24;26:28;"like Stephen Alpern, like some like new age musician."
26:28;26:30;"- I think the Erewhon vibe changed."
26:30;26:31;"I think like in 1980, yeah,"
26:31;26:33;"it's probably like a bit of like yacht rock."
26:33;26:35;"It's probably a bit of like health food"
26:35;26:38;"and cocaine vibes, bananas and blow."
26:38;26:41;"But certainly by 2011,"
26:41;26:45;"I think Erewhon had gone through a metamorphosis"
26:45;26:47;"and there's probably very little vestige"
26:47;26:49;"of the old hippie thing."
26:49;26:51;"And Erewhon was starting to become,"
26:51;26:53;"I don't know, like truly,"
26:53;26:56;"it's almost more on like some Travis Scott type."
26:56;26:59;"- Yeah, well, I think my first introduction."
26:59;27:00;"- There's no band."
27:00;27:01;"- My introduction to Erewhon."
27:01;27:02;"- Post music."
27:02;27:05;"- Was when we were making Neo Yokio."
27:05;27:08;"So what is this around 2014 or 15?"
27:08;27:12;"And Jaden Smith would do all of his records."
27:12;27:15;"He'd always have a bag of something from Erewhon."
27:15;27:16;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
27:16;27:19;"'Cause Jaden was the king of the Calabasas Erewhon."
27:19;27:20;"And it's interesting to think too"
27:20;27:22;"that the original Erewhon is in LA,"
27:22;27:23;"but people now,"
27:23;27:26;"because there's been a Silver Lake Erewhon for a few years,"
27:26;27:28;"Silver Lake being famously described"
27:28;27:31;"as kind of like a hipster, bougie,"
27:31;27:33;"new school bougie location."
27:33;27:34;"People think, oh yes,"
27:34;27:36;"Silver Lake Erewhon makes so much sense."
27:36;27:38;"But years before there was a Silver Lake Erewhon,"
27:38;27:40;"there was a Calabasas Erewhon."
27:40;27:44;"So before you had your little indie rockers,"
27:44;27:49;"indie filmmakers, and whoever going to Erewhon,"
27:49;27:52;"you had Jaden, probably Drake,"
27:52;27:54;"probably the Kardashians,"
27:54;27:56;"probably Kanye hitting the Silver,"
27:56;27:58;"the Calabasas Erewhon."
27:58;28:00;"Yeah, so that private equity guy,"
28:00;28:05;"in a way, he was betting on Kanye, Kim, and Jaden"
28:05;28:08;"and saying goodbye to television and talking heads."
28:08;28:10;"I mean, when you put it that way,"
28:10;28:14;"not a difficult choice from a money point of view."
28:14;28:17;"I'm thinking about his PowerPoint presentation."
28:17;28:22;"He's like, ""Say goodbye to Annie Hall and Marquee Moon."
28:22;28:25;"Say hello to Yeezus."""
28:25;28:27;"So does the group sex by the circle jerks?"
28:27;28:28;"The rest of the board being like,"
28:28;28:31;"""What the f*** is this guy talking about?"""
28:31;28:34;"I'm trying to find albums that came out in '80,"
28:34;28:35;"and it does surprise me."
28:35;28:36;"Circle jerks?"
28:36;28:38;"No, circle jerks were not hitting Erewhon."
28:38;28:41;"With all due respect, Mark, you're a music guy."
28:41;28:42;"I'm sure you respect it,"
28:42;28:45;"but when's the last time you really threw on Marquee Moon?"
28:45;28:48;"When's the last time you even listened to the title track"
28:48;28:49;"all the way through?"
28:49;28:51;"It's a great point, Ted."
28:51;28:54;"I mean, television, absolutely legends, influential,"
28:54;28:58;"but I'm not investing $350 million in them."
28:58;28:59;"Exactly."
28:59;29:00;"You're in the car listening to"
29:00;29:03;"my beautiful ""Dark Twisted Fantasy"" by Kanye."
29:03;29:06;"Where does that fall on your albums of all time?"
29:06;29:08;"Actually, that's number one for me."
29:08;29:09;"Ted, look at that, man."
29:09;29:10;"You're a 45-year-old man."
29:10;29:13;"You got a Kanye album as your number one album of all time."
29:13;29:14;"That says something."
29:14;29:15;"Let's invest in Erewhon."
29:15;29:18;"That screams $20 green juice."
29:18;29:21;"$20 green juice."
29:21;29:22;"Just crying your eyes out,"
29:22;29:24;"listening to ""Runaway"" by Kanye,"
29:24;29:26;"chugging a $20 green juice."
29:26;29:28;"This is the future."
29:28;29:31;"I remember"
29:31;29:36;"How the darkness doubled"
29:36;29:39;"I recall"
29:39;29:44;"Lightning struck itself"
29:44;29:48;"I was listening, listening"
29:48;29:52;"To the rain"
29:52;29:56;"I was hearing, hearing"
29:56;29:59;"Something else"
29:59;30:21;"I don't know how I struck it at night"
30:21;30:26;"But it's the best impression of your life"
30:26;30:30;"The last time we'd been mocking moon"
30:30;30:33;"But just waiting"
30:33;30:35;"Okay, but anyway, in Japan,"
30:35;30:37;"that choice was not made,"
30:37;30:39;"and Dean and DeLuca lives on."
30:39;30:42;"That's why it has this slight alternate universe feel."
30:42;30:43;"I dig it."
30:43;30:45;"What about this vision?"
30:45;30:49;"Is it this woman, this Japanese immigrant,"
30:49;30:51;"started this health food company"
30:51;30:53;"based on her macrobiotic diet"
30:53;30:55;"and Taoist religion."
30:55;30:57;"She goes, ""You know what? Brookline's not right."
30:57;31:00;"Dunkin' Donuts and Boston Market,"
31:00;31:02;"I'm going to go move to where I think"
31:02;31:04;"the vibe is kinder and more in line."""
31:04;31:06;"And she moves to Hollywood,"
31:06;31:08;"and she opens this place, and it's 1980,"
31:08;31:09;"and it really is."
31:09;31:10;"It's Motley Crue."
31:10;31:11;"It's X."
31:11;31:13;"It's the Circle Jerks."
31:13;31:15;"And they're all walking into it,"
31:15;31:17;"and she's like, ""Holy s***."
31:17;31:20;"This was not my vision of California."""
31:20;31:21;"Because that is what she's walking into."
31:21;31:23;"She's like, ""Where's Joanie, man?"""
31:23;31:24;"I guess that's what's funny."
31:24;31:26;"You had all those things at the same time."
31:26;31:29;"Were we getting a young Flea and Anthony Kiedis"
31:29;31:32;"walking into the first LA location of Erewhon?"
31:32;31:34;"You probably had a mixture of, like,"
31:34;31:36;"aging Hollywood hippies,"
31:36;31:38;"young punk rockers."
31:38;31:40;"Yeah, you could even picture some, like,"
31:40;31:41;"really old Hollywood."
31:41;31:42;"You could picture some, like,"
31:42;31:44;"you know, maybe Milton Berle"
31:44;31:46;"like rolling in there for"
31:46;31:48;"'cause he's like, ""Ah, my doctor tells me"
31:48;31:50;"I gotta eat this health food s***."""
31:50;31:52;"You know, you probably got all sorts of people in that one."
31:52;31:54;"That'd be a funny time machine, like,"
31:54;31:57;"go back and, like, work a shift at the first Erewhon,"
31:57;32:00;"like, within its first year of existence,"
32:00;32:01;"just for the people watching."
32:01;32:02;"Who's coming in?"
32:02;32:03;"Hey, for what it's worth,"
32:03;32:07;"mid-pandemic, I saw Jeremy Piven in Erewhon,"
32:07;32:11;"masked, fully off his face, flirting."
32:11;32:13;"Anyway, I don't know if I should get too deep into this,"
32:13;32:14;"but he was making a scene."
32:14;32:16;"No, please get deep into it."
32:16;32:17;"Oh, he's making a scene?"
32:17;32:18;"Well, here's the thing."
32:18;32:19;"What was the scene?"
32:19;32:21;"Okay, I heard him before I saw him."
32:21;32:23;"So there was a very loud person"
32:23;32:25;"multiple aisles down."
32:25;32:27;"Is this '20 or '21?"
32:27;32:29;"This would have been early '20."
32:29;32:30;"Oh, wow, okay."
32:30;32:32;"So I'm like, ""There's a spectacle happening."""
32:32;32:33;"Early pan."
32:33;32:34;"Early pan, mid-pan."
32:34;32:36;"So I crane, I crane my neck,"
32:36;32:37;"and over in the produce,"
32:37;32:40;"and you know that Silver Lake one is very tight,"
32:40;32:43;"and his mask is fully off his face,"
32:43;32:44;"and it's Jeremy Piven,"
32:44;32:45;"and he's holding court."
32:45;32:47;"I'm talking like he's talking to like"
32:47;32:48;"two, three different people."
32:48;32:50;"Like people are like spotting him,"
32:50;32:52;"and he's like stopping a conversation,"
32:52;32:53;"saying hi to somebody else."
32:53;32:55;"It was very Ari Gold,"
32:55;32:57;"and I will keep that memory with me forever."
32:57;33:01;"Oh, so he was making a scene in like a positive way?"
33:01;33:03;"Yeah, he was holding, he was very gregarious."
33:03;33:05;"It was spectacular in the literal sense."
33:05;33:07;"It was a positive scene for sure."
33:07;33:08;"Oh, I thought you were going to tell me"
33:08;33:09;"it was him just going off."
33:09;33:11;"He's like, ""$20 for a f***ing green juice."
33:11;33:12;"Are you f***ing kidding me?"""
33:12;33:14;"And they're like, ""Sir, what did you expect?"""
33:14;33:15;"No, no, no."
33:15;33:18;"It was a social, it was a warm social moment."
33:18;33:19;"A lot of interaction."
33:19;33:20;"That's all I'm saying."
33:20;33:22;"That's the modern Erewhon."
33:22;33:24;"1980, who knows?"
33:24;33:26;"You may have actually been getting a mix"
33:26;33:28;"of young punk rockers,"
33:28;33:31;"Cary Grant, Charlton Heston."
33:31;33:35;"Matchy sent a photo from like a stock image site"
33:35;33:38;"of Jeremy Piven at Erewhon."
33:38;33:41;"Just consuming, like going deep on some"
33:41;33:44;"pasta he's like eating outside of Erewhon."
33:44;33:46;"This might have been the time that I saw him actually."
33:46;33:48;"I didn't know there was a photo op involved."
33:48;33:49;"Amazing."
33:49;33:51;"Well, anyway, this is all to say"
33:51;33:53;"I've enjoyed this long tangent"
33:53;33:55;"because I really think there is something here."
33:55;33:57;"The declining fortunes of Dean and DeLuca,"
33:57;33:59;"the rising fortunes of Erewhon,"
33:59;34:01;"and what it says about America."
34:01;34:03;"That could be an airport book."
34:03;34:04;"I just want to remind, do you know the question"
34:04;34:07;"that got us on this 40 minute tangent?"
34:07;34:09;"Well, I know about Tully's."
34:09;34:10;"Do you know Tully's?"
34:10;34:12;"Yeah, do you know Tully's?"
34:12;34:16;"So anyway, Tully's, that's what I wanted to talk about."
34:16;34:20;"Because Tully's is very ubiquitous"
34:20;34:23;"from what I can tell here in Japan"
34:23;34:26;"or at least the places that I've spent time."
34:26;34:29;"And it's one of those things where you see the name"
34:29;34:32;"T-U-L-L-Y apostrophe S and you're like,"
34:32;34:34;"it sounds American, but then also"
34:34;34:38;"one of the giant chains here is called Lawson's,"
34:38;34:41;"which it's a convenience store."
34:41;34:43;"And it has like a slightly like Western,"
34:43;34:45;"wild Western font."
34:45;34:46;"And you're just like, wait, what is this place?"
34:46;34:47;"Is it Japanese?"
34:47;34:49;"I don't even know."
34:49;34:52;"But so Tully's, there's a lot of Tully's cafes."
34:52;34:55;"And even in the famous Japanese vending machines,"
34:55;34:57;"which have a lot of cans of coffee,"
34:57;35:00;"which I love and you have your Japanese companies,"
35:00;35:03;"like a coffee boss."
35:03;35:05;"But then I increasingly found myself"
35:05;35:09;"because I tend to drink black coffee,"
35:09;35:11;"not because I don't love milk and sugar,"
35:11;35:13;"but just 'cause I'm trying to limit the milk and sugar."
35:13;35:15;"So sometimes I'm scanning the thing,"
35:15;35:17;"just seeing like, wait, which one is just plain black?"
35:17;35:20;"And there's this one Tully's Barista's Black,"
35:20;35:25;"that's a can or like a metal bottle of just black coffee."
35:25;35:27;"And it tastes good."
35:27;35:28;"And it became like,"
35:28;35:30;"it's become my like go-to in the vending machines."
35:30;35:31;"So at some point I started thinking like,"
35:31;35:32;"wait, what is Tully's?"
35:32;35:34;"Is it, do I know it?"
35:34;35:36;"It weirdly rings a bell."
35:36;35:39;"And then I started walking past the cafes more"
35:39;35:40;"and I sent you guys a picture"
35:40;35:42;"where I'm just kind of looking at their menu."
35:42;35:43;"'Cause one thing I've noticed"
35:43;35:46;"about some of these Japanese coffee chains"
35:46;35:49;"is that they'll go one step further with the food"
35:49;35:51;"than say a Starbucks would in the US."
35:51;35:53;"So picture your typical relative,"
35:53;35:55;"kind of small coffee shop."
35:55;35:58;"Like a lot of people do go to these places for lunch,"
35:58;36:01;"these chain coffee places, even in the US,"
36:01;36:03;"but you're gonna expect to get a sandwich"
36:03;36:05;"mostly, maybe some snacks,"
36:05;36:07;"maybe some kind of pre-made salad."
36:07;36:09;"But I've noticed that some of these"
36:09;36:11;"comparable coffee chains in Japan,"
36:11;36:13;"you'll see them advertising like spaghetti lunch set."
36:13;36:15;"You know, just like picture going into like a Starbucks"
36:15;36:17;"and they have like a spaghetti lunch set."
36:17;36:18;"Pass."
36:18;36:21;"It would require a bit more kitchen space maybe,"
36:21;36:23;"or I don't know."
36:23;36:25;"So at Tully's, they weirdly have like a,"
36:25;36:26;"kind of a big menu."
36:26;36:28;"And what caught my eye last week,"
36:28;36:30;"which got me thinking more deeply about Tully's"
36:30;36:32;"was a big sign out front"
36:32;36:35;"that said ""Clam Chowder Hot Dog."""
36:35;36:37;"And I looked a little closely at the picture"
36:37;36:40;"and it really was just a hot dog in a bun"
36:40;36:42;"with clam chowder on the top."
36:42;36:44;"I was really struck by that."
36:44;36:45;"You know, I sent it to you guys,"
36:45;36:46;"I sent it to a few people,"
36:46;36:49;"everybody found it disgusting."
36:49;36:50;"I haven't tried it yet."
36:50;36:53;"I mean, I don't think it would actually be that bad to eat,"
36:53;36:55;"but it's a strange combination."
36:55;36:56;"And then I was thinking like,"
36:56;36:57;"""Wait, what is Tully's?"""
36:57;36:58;"And then I started looking it up"
36:58;37:01;"and Tully's is actually"
37:01;37:02;"an American chain."
37:02;37:04;"And it's one of these kind of zombie chains."
37:04;37:06;"Maybe it's not fair to say zombie,"
37:06;37:09;"but it's a chain that lives on in Japan."
37:09;37:11;"And yet it's an American brand"
37:11;37:14;"that doesn't exist in America anymore."
37:14;37:15;"- I've hit it."
37:15;37:16;"- You've hit a Tully's."
37:16;37:18;"- Yeah, 'cause I lived in the Pacific Northwest"
37:18;37:21;"late 20th century, early 21st century."
37:21;37:23;"- Late 20th century, man."
37:23;37:25;"- Yeah, late 20th century, man."
37:25;37:27;"So yeah, I'm familiar with Tully's."
37:27;37:28;"When you sent the photos,"
37:28;37:30;"late 20th century in the Pacific Northwest,"
37:30;37:31;"you'd see Starbucks,"
37:31;37:34;"you'd see Pete's,"
37:34;37:36;"you'd see Seattle's Best."
37:36;37:37;"- Right."
37:37;37:38;"- You'd see Tully's."
37:38;37:39;"Wouldn't see a Dunkin'."
37:39;37:40;"- Yeah."
37:40;37:42;"- Right, yeah, that was not Dunkin' country."
37:42;37:43;"- No."

38:29;38:31;"- It's funny how, you know,"
38:31;38:34;"last time we were talking about Alice in Chains,"
38:34;38:37;"who are often considered one of the big four"
38:37;38:38;"of Seattle grunge,"
38:38;38:41;"Nirvana and Pearl Jam, obviously up top,"
38:41;38:45;"and then not all that far behind Soundgarden, Alice in Chains."
38:45;38:47;"Those are the big four Seattle grunge bands."
38:47;38:51;"I mean, this is another example of like a chain kind of like"
38:51;38:54;"rising to prominence along with the music scene."
38:54;38:56;"Think about the fact that we could,"
38:56;38:58;"there's probably also like a big four"
38:58;39:00;"of Washington State coffee chains"
39:00;39:03;"that didn't start in the grunge era,"
39:03;39:04;"but rose to prominence."
39:04;39:07;"Starbucks is obviously the Pearl Jam."
39:07;39:08;"- Or is it the Nirvana?"
39:08;39:09;"- Which is the Nirvana?"
39:09;39:10;"That gets hard to say."
39:10;39:11;"- That's the Longevity."
39:11;39:13;"So it's the Pearl Jam."
39:13;39:14;"- Yeah, still kicking."
39:14;39:16;"But maybe Tully's is the Alice in Chains."
39:16;39:20;"So Tully's was founded in 1992 by Tom Tully,"
39:20;39:23;"O'Keeffe in Seattle, Washington."
39:23;39:26;"O'Keeffe originally planned to rival Starbucks,"
39:26;39:28;"but refocused its approach to the Seattle area,"
39:28;39:31;"specifically the Puget Sound region."
39:31;39:32;"- Puget."
39:32;39:33;"- Oh, Puget."
39:33;39:34;"Thank you."
39:34;39:37;"Eventually they'd expand into California, Idaho, and Arizona."
39:37;39:39;"And then they licensed the brand for use"
39:39;39:42;"in South Korea and Japan."
39:42;39:46;"There was some stores in Singapore, Manila, Beijing,"
39:46;39:47;"all over the world."
39:47;39:50;"But eventually Tully's sold its North American wholesale"
39:50;39:53;"coffee bean distribution to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,"
39:53;39:55;"which is, I think, eventually became part of the same"
39:55;39:59;"giant company that does Keurig and Dr. Pepper."
39:59;40:00;"- Okay."
40:00;40:01;"- As with all these things,"
40:01;40:03;"just increasingly huge companies buy all these things."
40:03;40:06;"There's something particularly funny about the fate of Tully's"
40:06;40:09;"to me, because it's a guy's name."
40:09;40:10;"It's a dude."
40:10;40:15;"It's just like a local dude in Seattle in '92,"
40:15;40:18;"the year that Dyrt came out."
40:18;40:20;"Probably blasting Dyrt."
40:20;40:21;"- Epic year."
40:21;40:23;"- Yes, you really could make the case."
40:23;40:26;"Tully's and Dyrt, Marky Moon and Dean and DeLuca."
40:26;40:29;"- I think it's also worth mentioning that Dyrt got the famed"
40:29;40:32;"TC bump last week, because it re-entered the Billboard"
40:32;40:34;"Top 200 Albums Chart."
40:34;40:35;"- Yes."
40:35;40:36;"- That's got to be because of our episode."
40:36;40:38;"- I mean, there were so many people listening"
40:38;40:40;"who went out and had a Dyrt night."
40:40;40:43;"And the thing about throwing a Dyrt night is you invite"
40:43;40:46;"somebody over for a Dyrt night, you listen to Dyrt,"
40:46;40:49;"well, they're going to go home and want to listen to Dyrt again"
40:49;40:50;"with their family."
40:50;40:52;"Now maybe their kids are listening to Dyrt."
40:52;40:55;"Maybe the kids are at school the next day saying,"
40:55;40:57;"""Hey, have you guys ever had a Dyrt night?"""
40:57;40:59;"And the other kid's saying, ""What's Dyrt night?"""
40:59;41:01;"""Well, it's when you throw on the Alice in Chains album Dyrt."""
41:01;41:02;"""Hold on, Alice in Chains?"
41:02;41:04;"I don't know what you're talking about."""
41:04;41:05;"""Wow, you got some listening to."""
41:05;41:07;"Now these kids are going home listening to Dyrt."
41:07;41:10;"So anyway, for every one person who listened to that episode"
41:10;41:13;"of Time Crisis, I think it's fair to say that two to three hundred"
41:13;41:19;"other people ended up listening to Dyrt within four or five days."
41:19;41:21;"Listening and buying the album."
41:21;41:24;"Time Crisis talks about Alice in Chains Dyrt."
41:24;41:30;"Within a week, you have an 11-year-old in Wichita, Kansas,"
41:30;41:34;"buying a 180-gram vinyl pressing of the album."
41:34;41:37;"And his dad, who works at the corporate headquarters"
41:37;41:41;"of Dean and DeLuca, has a nice walk down memory lane."
41:41;41:42;"That's right."
41:42;41:45;"Yeah, there's something so funny to me about Tully's just being like"
41:45;41:47;"a dude's name because it's one thing--"
41:47;41:49;"I guess it's kind of similar to McDonald's,"
41:49;41:53;"but it's one thing to be like, ""Oh, yeah, that brand which, you know,"
41:53;41:57;"somebody started in the '60s, got bought and sold and bought and sold,"
41:57;42:02;"and now it's part of a portfolio from some giant anonymous company,"
42:02;42:04;"and it's so disconnected from its roots."""
42:04;42:07;"But it's particularly funny and weird when it's somebody's name."
42:07;42:11;"Just like this dude gave his name to this company,"
42:11;42:17;"and now through all the ups and downs of global finance and branding"
42:17;42:22;"and marketing and licensing, they're selling clam chowder hot dogs."
42:22;42:23;"Yeah, yeah."
42:23;42:26;"When I started researching and I was thinking about the clam chowder hot dog,"
42:26;42:29;"I just really wished I could call--I don't know if he's alive--"
42:29;42:32;"but call Tom ""Tully"" O'Keefe and just be like,"
42:32;42:36;"""Man, back in '92, you're sitting there in Seattle blasting dirt."
42:36;42:39;"Did you ever think that 30 years later,"
42:39;42:44;"somebody might be chowing down on a clam chowder hot dog in Kyoto"
42:44;42:46;"and saying your name out loud?"""
42:46;42:47;"And he'd just be like--"
42:47;42:48;"Yes."
42:48;42:49;"Life is pretty weird, man."
42:49;42:54;"I also wonder, too, with the clam chowder hot dog,"
42:54;42:59;"I'd love to talk to somebody who works at the test kitchen of Japanese Tully's."
42:59;43:03;"I wonder if--I mean, clam chowder is not a Japanese thing."
43:03;43:06;"Clam chowder is an American thing."
43:06;43:08;"They eat clams. They eat soup."
43:08;43:11;"But I wonder if there was somebody who was like, ""Yeah, clam chowder."
43:11;43:15;"It's kind of American. Hot dogs are American. Put them together."
43:15;43:16;"It's like a special American thing."""
43:16;43:19;"And then again, I know it's a two-way street."
43:19;43:23;"Then I started to think about--I wonder if Panda Express ever does"
43:23;43:28;"some special thing where they throw together two seemingly Chinese flavors"
43:28;43:29;"into an American."
43:29;43:31;"They're like, ""Well, that totally makes sense."
43:31;43:33;"Why wouldn't you,"" and a Chinese person would just be like, ""What?"""
43:33;43:35;"It's a loss in translation."
43:35;43:38;"You've got to try that clam chowder hot dog, dude."
43:38;43:40;"Yeah, I guess I will."
43:40;43:44;"I'm finding a lot of recipes online for clam chowder hot dogs."
43:44;43:49;"It does feel like this idea--look, there are no new ideas,"
43:49;43:56;"but this one did sound pretty novel, but it does seem--this one's crazy."
43:56;44:02;"This one from a blog called The Food in My Beard, which is so gross."
44:02;44:05;"This blog starts off, and this is great."
44:05;44:09;"It goes, ""I saw my friend, the vulgar chef, dip a hot dog in a cup of clam chowder,"
44:09;44:11;"and honestly, it changed my life."
44:11;44:13;"I made these right after I saw it."""
44:13;44:17;"So that's an interesting origin story, but it does feel,"
44:17;44:19;"when I look at the rest of them, too, there's a lot."
44:19;44:26;"I mean, this is a palate or a combo that has occurred to a lot of people."
44:26;44:30;"Pillsbury.com--oh, no, they have a creamy corn hot dog chowder."
44:30;44:32;"Oh, where the hot dogs are in the chowder."
44:32;44:34;"Yes, this is a different one."
44:34;44:39;"One way of thinking about it is imagine it's a cold New England day."
44:39;44:43;"You're in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
44:43;44:48;"You've been working down at the dockyards."
44:48;44:53;"Maybe you've been out on a whaling ship, a commercial vessel."
44:53;44:55;"You're just cold as hell."
44:55;44:57;"Just the chill has gotten into your bones."
44:57;45:00;"You're damp. You're freezing."
45:00;45:02;"It's a gray New England day."
45:02;45:09;"You come back to shore, walk in to a little shack by the dockyards,"
45:09;45:16;"and someone's cooking up a nice, big, hot cauldron of New England clam chowder."
45:16;45:18;"Hot, creamy clam chowder."
45:18;45:20;"You walk in. The smell is just amazing."
45:20;45:22;"Oh, you're so cold. You're so wet."
45:22;45:23;"It smells so good."
45:23;45:25;"And then they say, ""You know what else?"
45:25;45:28;"We've got some piping hot hot dogs to go along with that."""
45:28;45:32;"You sit down with a hearty bowl of New England clam chowder--"
45:32;45:33;"Oh, yeah."
45:33;45:37;"--and a big, fat, hot hot dog next to you."
45:37;45:41;"You tell me you're not going to dip that hot dog into that New England clam chowder"
45:41;45:43;"and just go to town?"
45:43;45:45;"Well, you're doing it."
45:45;45:46;"You're starving, dude."
45:46;45:49;"You just have a crisp IPA with you."
45:49;45:50;"You're going to town."
45:50;45:51;"Is this considered a--"
45:51;45:53;"Is that a fully loaded hot dog?"
45:53;45:55;"Is it fully loaded at that point?"
45:55;45:57;"I think once you get into the seafood category,"
45:57;46:01;"a fully loaded seafood hot dog would have to have more than clam chowder."
46:01;46:04;"I want to see some shrimp."
46:04;46:09;"I want to see maybe some little chunks of lobster, some scallops."
46:09;46:10;"Some scallops?"
46:10;46:11;"Some haddock."
46:11;46:12;"I think we're going to need to get more of a mix."
46:12;46:15;"I mean, and also when you think about it, speaking of New England,"
46:15;46:19;"a lobster roll is just lobster chunks in a hot dog bun."
46:19;46:22;"It's not crazy, a clam chowder hot dog."
46:22;46:26;"For all I know, the people in the Japanese test kitchen were--"
46:26;46:29;"they were just checking out the Food and My Beard blog"
46:29;46:33;"to see what American amateur chefs are up to, and they got the idea."
46:33;46:37;"But either way, I doubt that this New England combination"
46:37;46:40;"would particularly speak to Tom Tullio Keith."

47:30;47:32;"One other thing about the Tully's Coffee,"
47:32;47:37;"and just a reminder of how strange these brand acquisitions are,"
47:37;47:40;"at some point, you know, the original Tully,"
47:40;47:45;"Tom Tully O'Keefe, had nothing to do with the company anymore."
47:45;47:49;"They'd filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012."
47:49;47:55;"And then Global Baristas, an investment group led by actor Patrick Dempsey,"
47:55;47:59;"bought Tully's via bankruptcy auction."
47:59;48:03;"So it's this weird thing where, yeah, the actor Patrick Dempsey,"
48:03;48:06;"I mean, we should get him on the show sometime."
48:06;48:07;"- I wonder how often- - McDreamy."
48:07;48:11;"Yeah, McDreamy. He was on Grey's Anatomy."
48:11;48:13;"He's been acting since he, I think he was even like a child actor."
48:13;48:15;"He was like a teen heartthrob in the 80s."
48:15;48:18;"He got into the private equity game."
48:18;48:21;"He started a company, Global Baristas."
48:21;48:26;"He bought Tully's, but then he eventually backed out of the partnership"
48:26;48:29;"and sued his partner at Global Baristas,"
48:29;48:31;"who was Patrick Dempsey's partner at Global Baristas,"
48:31;48:38;"none other than I believe currently imprisoned lawyer, Michael Avenatti."
48:38;48:40;"Sounds like an awesome company."
48:40;48:43;"And for people who don't know, Michael Avenatti,"
48:43;48:46;"he's in prison for something about Nike."
48:46;48:48;"Remember, he was Stormy Daniels' attorney."
48:48;48:53;"He became this kind of like resistance icon for a while all over MSNBC and CNN."
48:53;48:55;"He was like, ""We're going to take down Trump."""
48:55;48:59;"There are people even saying, ""Oh, this guy could be the next president."""
48:59;49:01;"Anyway, he played a role."
49:01;49:02;"That's wild he's in prison."
49:02;49:03;"Currently in prison."
49:03;49:04;"That's wild."
49:04;49:09;"He's in prison for 48 months for fraud and aggravated identity theft."
49:09;49:10;"Yikes."
49:10;49:12;"Aggravated identity theft?"
49:12;49:13;"Yeah, it was aggravated."
49:13;49:14;"Aggravated."
49:14;49:17;"Who's the current head of--"
49:17;49:22;"So both Dempsey and Avenatti out, who's the current head of--"
49:22;49:25;"I don't know what happened to Global Baristas."
49:25;49:26;"Captain of the ship."
49:26;49:27;"I don't think they--"
49:27;49:29;"Global Baristas."
49:29;49:34;"I don't think Global Baristas has anything to do with Tully's anymore."
49:34;49:35;"Oh, man."
49:35;49:38;"And Tully's Japan, I think, just kind of has its own thing going."
49:38;49:43;"But it seems like they're doing a great job because you see the coffee everywhere."
49:43;49:49;"I mean, you see the chain everywhere, but you also see the coffee in convenience stores and machines."
49:49;49:50;"And it's really good."
49:50;49:51;"Wow."
49:51;49:59;"But anyway, yeah, the journey from 1992 Seattle to clam chowder, hot dogs in Kyoto."
49:59;50:02;"I mean, that's just the story of our world, really."
50:02;50:03;"That's your airport book."
50:03;50:06;"That's my-- yeah."
50:06;50:12;"Ezra, are you still planning on doing any traveling around Japan while you're still there?"
50:12;50:14;"Yeah, I'm sure I'll be doing a bit of traveling."
50:14;50:22;"Well, Tully's has just announced that they're going to have eight region-limited drinks that have gone up."
50:22;50:30;"They did a nationwide or regional election, and each region elected a different coffee drink that will be local."
50:30;50:41;"So if you, for example, were to find yourself in Shikoku area, you could get a pink salt and double nut latte."
50:41;50:42;"Latte."
50:42;50:46;"And these, they're all very different."
50:46;50:48;"The Tokyo region special latte is kind of boring."
50:48;50:51;"Vanilla cow roo creme brulee."
50:51;50:53;"I guess creme brulee is kind of interesting."
50:53;50:59;"Hokkaido one, it's only in Hokkaido, this hobaru peanuts, it's described as the name of the cafe--"
50:59;51:04;"the name of the coffee translates to lots of peanuts."
51:04;51:05;"And that's what it is."
51:05;51:07;"It's also topped with roasted peanuts."
51:07;51:10;"So it's a peanut drink topped with roasted peanuts."
51:10;51:12;"It's fully loaded."
51:12;51:13;"I'm not mad at that."
51:13;51:15;"A fully loaded latte."
51:15;51:19;"So I think as you go, if you do plan on doing some traveling, you should try to hit these up."
51:19;51:21;"Wait, last question."
51:21;51:22;"Can somebody get me a number crunch?"
51:22;51:25;"How many Tully's are there in Japan?"
51:25;51:33;"And if I dedicate the rest of my time in Japan to hitting all of them, could I feasibly become the winter of Japanese Tully's?"
51:33;51:35;"How many are there?"
51:35;51:36;"Tully-bucking."
51:37;51:39;"I don't think you're going to be able to pull that off, dude."
51:39;51:42;"I will say it's the 25th anniversary of Tully's."
51:42;51:45;"So it's been there for 25 years in Japan."
51:45;51:46;"25 years in Japan."
51:46;51:49;"And I think that that is a noble effort while you're there."
51:49;51:52;"I'm seeing 750 Tully's in Japan."
51:52;51:53;"Oh my god."
51:53;51:54;"What?"
51:54;51:56;"750 Tully's in Japan?"
51:56;51:57;"You better get started."
51:57;52:00;"That's as of November of last year."
52:00;52:02;"So that's really next level."
52:02;52:03;"That's an uphill battle."
52:03;52:08;"Are there zero Tully's in America or are there still some random Tully's hanging on somewhere?"
52:08;52:21;"So when I was looking at Michael Avenatti actually just to see what he was in for serving time, I found a headline like five results down that was like, the headline was a
quote, ""We are not opening any more Tully's."""
52:21;52:25;"Like it was Avenatti being like, ""No more Tully's in America."""
52:25;52:26;"That was the headline."
52:26;52:28;"So I think it's zero."
52:28;52:29;"Wow."
52:29;52:30;"What a career."
52:30;52:39;"Just like that just kind of sums it up like a dude five years earlier is just out there on like Bloomberg News just being like, ""Listen folks, Tully's is ours."
52:39;52:41;"We're not opening it anymore."
52:41;52:43;"Yeah, sorry if that hurts your feelings, but we're done."""
52:43;52:46;"And then like five years later, just like, ""Donald Trump is a dangerous man."
52:46;52:47;"He's going down."""
52:47;52:54;"Just like bringing that exact same energy from global baristas to politics."
52:54;53:14;"The way that Tully's got to Japan is that in 1997, a Sanwa Bank employee named Koto Matsuda personally went to Tom O'Keefe and said, ""We really need some high-end coffee
shops in Japan."""
53:14;53:23;"And so O'Keefe listened and then made Matsuda the CEO of all of Tully's."
53:23;53:24;"Of Tully's Coffee Japan."
53:24;53:29;"So this fan, this Java head said, ""I need you to bring something here."""
53:29;53:30;"He said, ""You know what?"
53:30;53:31;"You run it."""
53:31;53:32;"I don't know."
53:32;53:33;"It seems like a great story."
53:33;53:34;"No, it is."
53:34;53:40;"And also unlike Starbucks who run their overseas operations, Tully's expanded in Japan through franchising."
53:40;53:46;"And I appreciate that because then you're giving local people in Japan a real piece of the action."
53:46;53:48;"And I think that's the way to do it."
53:48;53:50;"And 750, that's no joke."
53:50;53:51;"That's a real success story."

55:49;55:58;"I've been hearing you talk about this band, second grade for a while, and you got Peter, maybe some other members, at least Peter from second grade on the show."
55:58;56:00;"Yep, I'm excited."
56:00;56:04;"Second grade's been your favorite new band for a minute, right?"
56:04;56:05;"Yeah."
56:05;56:06;"When did they cross your radar?"
56:06;56:11;"2020. I got into their album Hit to Hit, which was their second album."
56:11;56:16;"They just put out their third album, Easy Listening, a few weeks ago."
56:16;56:19;"I've listened to their three albums a lot."
56:19;56:27;"In terms of bands who are youngish, who are kind of underdogs that I'm rooting for, second grade is my favorite band for sure."
56:27;56:29;"Have you listened to them at all?"
56:29;56:32;"Yeah, I was checking them out when you said they're going to be on the show."
56:32;56:35;"Great vibe, real ear, great melodies."
56:35;56:37;"Yeah, great songwriting."
56:37;56:48;"It has that vibe of like when you, it kind of like all three of their records have that vibe of like you just started a band with your friends and you have like the band's
going in like nine different directions at once."
56:48;56:55;"And you have a lot of ideas and you're just like having fun recording quickly and you're doing it well."
56:55;56:57;"I don't know. I love the band."
56:57;57:05;"The new album has a song called Kramer in LA, which Seinfeld, you were introduced to recently."
57:05;57:08;"They're hitting a lot of parts of the TC universe."
57:08;57:11;"Seinfeld, what did you think when you heard Kramer in LA?"
57:11;57:13;"I mean, I was instantly hooked."
57:13;57:16;"I was listening to it on repeat earlier today."
57:16;57:22;"It's a song I think that captures the energy and the pathos of that two-part episode, The Trip."
57:22;57:24;"So yeah, I'm excited."
57:24;57:28;"It's like if Chet Baker was a Seinfeld fan or something."
57:28;57:29;"Yes."
57:29;57:31;"Love that."
57:31;57:33;"All right, well, let's get Peter on the phone."
57:33;57:34;"Yeah."
57:34;57:37;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
57:37;57:42;"Hello."
57:42;57:43;"Peter."
57:43;57:45;"Peter, what's up?"
57:45;57:47;"What's going on, everyone?"
57:47;57:50;"Welcome to Time Crisis. Thanks for being on."
57:50;57:53;"Thanks. It's an honor to be here. Thank you for having me."
57:53;57:57;"We were just talking about Seinfeld or Kramer in LA."
57:57;58:02;"We were just saying that's kind of like if Chet Baker was a Seinfeld fan or something."
58:02;58:08;"That's what I was going for. Yeah, totally."
58:08;58:11;"Where are you calling from? Are you in Philadelphia?"
58:11;58:13;"Yeah, I'm calling from Philly here."
58:13;58:18;"I'm dog sitting at the moment, so I'm hanging out with this cool guy, Marlo."
58:18;58:19;"Oh, hell yeah."
58:19;58:20;"Oh, hey, what's up, Marlo?"
58:20;58:22;"Yeah, he's a chiller."
58:22;58:24;"Good boy."
58:24;58:29;"Well, actually, one question I wanted to ask is you guys are a Philly band."
58:29;58:33;"Are you and everybody from the Philly area?"
58:33;58:40;"So we all come from different places originally, kind of all over the Northeast and East Coast."
58:40;58:48;"I'm from Maine myself, and we all kind of converged in Philly over the last few years or so."
58:48;58:50;"And everyone lives there now."
58:50;58:53;"And did you move to Philly to like be in bands?"
58:53;58:55;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
58:55;58:57;"I play in this other band that's called Friendship."
58:57;59:00;"It's kind of like a country-ish kind of band."
59:00;59:07;"And Friendship, we formed up in Maine on this little island off the coast called Little Cranberry."
59:07;59:12;"Yeah, we were like doing music up there and decided that we were going to move to Philly."
59:12;59:15;"What's going on on Little Cranberry? Is that where you're from?"
59:15;59:18;"I'm not from there, but I lived there for a while."
59:18;59:21;"It's a big lobster fishing island."
59:21;59:26;"And that's what I was doing up there, working on a lobster boat for a while."
59:26;59:31;"So you probably had some real cold, hard days out there on that boat."
59:31;59:32;"Oh, for sure."
59:32;59:34;"I see where this is going."
59:34;59:37;"When you get back to shore, what's the ideal meal?"
59:37;59:41;"Because sometimes you're getting back to shore, I imagine you're cold and wet."
59:41;59:44;"The chill has probably entered your bones, right?"
59:44;59:56;"I would say the ideal, the ultimate thing that I could look forward to would be a nice slice of warm homemade meatloaf"
59:56;01:00:03;"with some mashed potatoes on the side and a nice green salad to kind of balance things out there."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"Delicious."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Yeah."
01:00:05;01:00:11;"How much New England clam chowder is being consumed up in Maine?"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"Quite a, I'd say the lion's share of it is being consumed up there."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Yeah, quite a bit."
01:00:17;01:00:23;"A lot of it's coming out of bread bowls, which is the ideal vessel for such a concoction."
01:00:23;01:00:29;"Part of why I'm asking this is, do you think it's crazy to put New England clam chowder on a hot dog?"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"Wow."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I've never heard of that in my life."
01:00:34;01:00:39;"But now that you're like kind of asking me, no, I think that would be pretty good, actually."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"I would try that."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"Okay."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"There you go."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Somebody with some actual experience being in New England."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"A little bit of backstory."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Lobsterman."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Ezra's in Japan right now."
01:00:49;01:00:57;"And there's a defunct American coffee chain called Tully's that has 750 locations in Japan."
01:00:57;01:01:05;"But they're also running a promo right now of a clam chowder hot dog."
01:01:05;01:01:09;"Yeah, we were wondering, does that have any roots in..."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Wow."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"On the one hand, yeah, it doesn't actually sound that crazy when you pause to think about it."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"It is unusual."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"But so you've actually had the experience of..."
01:01:18;01:01:25;"Because then we started talking about like actually being in New England and, you know, working and a cold, wet job and coming back to shore."
01:01:25;01:01:37;"So have you actually had the experience of coming off a hard day's work on the lobster boat and consuming a piping hot, cold New England clam chowder?"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"No, no, that actually I haven't done that."
01:01:41;01:01:48;"No, because I feel like clam chowder to me seems like something that requires some time to prepare."
01:01:48;01:01:53;"And when I'm coming off the boat, I'm probably just eating, heating up like leftovers or something."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Oh, I guess you could heat up clam chowder, huh?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"No, I just never..."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"Clam chowder wasn't really part of my diet on the island."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Yeah."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"Okay."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"So you were living on the island at the time."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"So I imagine there's not too much happening there."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"You get off a hard day's work on the boat."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"You're going home."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"It's not like there's a vibrant Popeye-esque dockyards."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"Seaside shanty."
01:02:16;01:02:19;"Like a cool dive bar right there."
01:02:19;01:02:24;"And then some place where there's like some old man cooking up a big cauldron of clam chowder."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"And you're just like, yeah, grab a bowl, 50 cents."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Rip a hunk of bread."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Oh, that sounds awesome."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"That's kind of what I was hoping for when I signed up to do it."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"And yeah, it turned out to be nothing like that."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"No vibrant dock scene."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"What is there on..."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"You said it's called Little Cranberry Island?"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"Little Cranberry."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Yeah."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"There's not a whole lot."
01:02:44;01:02:55;"The one main attraction is someone in the restaurant world put in a ton of effort to establish kind of like a fine dining restaurant way out on this island,"
01:02:55;01:03:00;"which is quite an undertaking considering like, you know, staffing."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Like who's going to work there?"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"How are you going to get all these nice ingredients out there?"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Right."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"So it's a labor of love."
01:03:07;01:03:19;"And I guess Martha Stewart is a really big fan of this restaurant and takes her private boat there quite a bit to enjoy their famous crab cakes, I guess."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"Yeah."
01:03:20;01:03:25;"So you have one like really high end fine dining restaurant and then like a subway?"
01:03:25;01:03:30;"Yeah, there's really no, none of those like fast food places or anything out there."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"It's pretty much that one restaurant."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"It's a little supermarket."
01:03:34;01:03:44;"And there's like a tiny little general store, I guess, that you can like pick your mail up at the store and they might have like deli sandwiches."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"That's about it though."
01:03:46;01:03:53;"Is there a single bar, if not a vibrant dockyard bar where sailors get in fights?"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"There's a bar at least on Little Cranberry?"
01:03:55;01:04:00;"Yeah, there's a bar that's within that restaurant, the dock bar."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"And would you ever play shows there?"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"What's the venue scene like?"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Well, you said you had a band called Friendship."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"I know that band too."
01:04:08;01:04:11;"Yeah, we did play at the restaurant."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"We did it two times actually."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"And yeah, that was pretty fun actually."
01:04:15;01:04:28;"You know, when you play somewhere like that, where there's not a lot of live music or performances happening on a regular basis, people get really excited when there's
any sort of show."
01:04:28;01:04:32;"And so basically the whole island is there to like check out this performance."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"The whole island comes out. That's sick."
01:04:34;01:04:44;"White Vans, cold lips, drinking from a Jaeger Nest."
01:04:44;01:04:54;"Red tail on the hut, failed mice better run."
01:04:54;01:05:05;"Cold world, isn't it? Doesn't seem to want to quit."
01:05:05;01:05:14;"Taking a bite out of you."
01:05:14;01:05:24;"White Vans, purple V, light walk, holy jeez."
01:05:24;01:05:34;"Red tail on the hunt, looking out for number one."
01:05:34;01:05:47;"Cold world, won't relent. You're still working on your big project."
01:05:47;01:05:52;"Of loving the stranger."
01:05:52;01:05:57;"Loving the stranger."
01:05:57;01:06:01;"Love is a stranger, everywhere you go."
01:06:01;01:06:04;"Well, so you said that that friendship started on Little Cranberry."
01:06:04;01:06:08;"Are the other people in the band, lobster fishermen?"
01:06:08;01:06:13;"What do you say? You say lobster men? Lobster fishermen makes no sense."
01:06:13;01:06:20;"Lobster men, yeah. One of the others was a lobster man and another was a carpenter's assistant."
01:06:20;01:06:23;"And you didn't know each other prior to..."
01:06:23;01:06:27;"We all knew each other from like high school, growing up together."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"And so like we had..."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"On the mainland."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"On the mainland, yeah."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"On the main mainland."
01:06:31;01:06:39;"A much more normal kind of suburban place that has your subways and your dominoes, that kind of stuff."
01:06:39;01:06:45;"But we, yeah, so like we knew each other for years, but we had all ended up on this island together somehow."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"This is an amazing origin story, by the way. I just want to say that."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Like, what was it like at the time?"
01:06:50;01:07:00;"I mean, it sounds so cool and romantic to me to picture being on like some cold ass main island."
01:07:00;01:07:04;"Were you there in the off season or is this in the summer or year round?"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Yeah, year round."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"You spent a dark winter on Little Cranberry."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I did, yeah. Yeah, it was really cold."
01:07:10;01:07:18;"There was one point where it snowed a lot and the power lines that power the whole island from the mainland,"
01:07:18;01:07:23;"those lines went down and it took them a week to restore power."
01:07:23;01:07:29;"So we didn't have like access to electricity or hot water for a week."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"And that was really a bummer."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"So you just freezing?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"We were so cold."
01:07:34;01:07:40;"We had a wood stove, but you'd have to like wake up in the middle of the night to like throw more wood on it."
01:07:40;01:07:46;"Cause otherwise you'd wake up and it'd be freezing cold and like the pipes would all be frozen and you'd have no water."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"That was like near the end of my time there."
01:07:49;01:07:57;"And at that point, I think the romance had worn off, but I'd say all in all, it was a pretty romantic experience."
01:07:57;01:08:04;"Yeah, just being up there on the coast of Maine and like just reading tons of books in our off time."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Cause like there's nothing else to do."
01:08:06;01:08:12;"And there's a great radio station up there, like a community radio that has,"
01:08:12;01:08:16;"they have a recurring Bob Dylan radio show every week."
01:08:16;01:08:23;"And so like we tune into that and I understand we have some Dylan heads in the chat here."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"That's right."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"And they would play like,"
01:08:25;01:08:32;"This is just like some crazy Dylan head had their own show and just be going deep bootlegs and live and all that kind of stuff."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Yeah, exactly."
01:08:33;01:08:41;"And he was like really into playing like a lot of the fan favorite kind of bootlegs that never made it on albums and stuff."
01:08:41;01:08:44;"So that was like my first time hearing a lot of those songs."
01:08:44;01:08:50;"And I haven't really stopped digging since listening to that show."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"You had a real taste of 20th century living."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"I was going to say and 19th."
01:08:54;01:09:03;"And 19th. You had a combination of 19th and, I love that, listening to the radio on a cold, snowy Maine Island."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"I mean, it sounds amazing."
01:09:04;01:09:11;"I'm sure at the time there must have been some low points being really cold."
01:09:11;01:09:15;"Yeah, but I'd say looking back, it was like the ultimate experience."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Maine is just a special place."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"I've always loved Maine."
01:09:18;01:09:24;"Yeah, in my limited time there, I always thought that's truly one of the greatest places in America."
01:09:24;01:09:27;"And what was it like actually working on the boat?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"It was hard."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Yeah, I kind of got my butt kicked by that job."
01:09:31;01:09:40;"The worst part for me was like, so the workflow is like the traps would come up out of the water on this like pulley system."
01:09:40;01:09:50;"And my job was to sort through the trap really quickly to like the lobsters that are like legal of the right size and gender and stuff to be harvested."
01:09:50;01:09:54;"Those go in a pile and make sure everything else in the trap gets thrown back in the water."
01:09:54;01:10:00;"And so basically this trap comes up and you have like 20 lobsters that are ready to fight you."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"They all have their claws."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"They're all going like this."
01:10:03;01:10:13;"And you're just like plunging your hand into the seething mass of crustaceans and hoping you're not getting your fingers pinched."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"What kind of gloves are you wearing?"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"I was wearing some like cloth gloves."
01:10:18;01:10:22;"So they had some dexterity to them, but not a ton."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"And how did it feel when the lobsters got you?"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"It hurts a lot."
01:10:26;01:10:30;"And so, so lobsters have - they have two different claws."
01:10:30;01:10:35;"One of them is really fast and sharp and it's called the pincer claw."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"And that's the one that got me a lot."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"And it is like the sharp pain."
01:10:40;01:10:44;"And then their other claw, that's the one you really have to watch out for is the crusher claw."
01:10:44;01:10:51;"It's gigantic and it could probably break your finger if it - it's a lot slower though."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"Even with these gloves you're wearing, it could break your finger?"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"I think it could. Yeah, I mean I never really -"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"It could f*** you up."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"It could probably really f*** you up. Yeah."
01:11:01;01:11:05;"I never gave it the chance. I never got the crusher. I only got the pincer."
01:11:05;01:11:10;"It's a little like, you know, like fighting video games where there's different characters."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"And some of them are like really fast and they do like small amounts of damage."
01:11:14;01:11:21;"And then there's like your Donkey Kong or something that his attack takes five seconds, but if it hits you, you're done."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"Something like that."
01:11:23;01:11:26;"Right. A little more time to prepare. You got to get the hell out of there."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"So is it easy to tell a lobster's gender?"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Pretty easy once you know what to look for."
01:11:31;01:11:37;"You got to like flip it over and you're looking for these like two little hard -"
01:11:37;01:11:43;"they're like two little plastic like things that are protruding from the bottom side of it."
01:11:43;01:11:46;"And also like a lot of the females have tons of eggs."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"So that's like a pretty obvious giveaway too."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"Because you can see the eggs."
01:11:50;01:11:55;"As you inspected all these crabs, did you ever see one of the famous two-tone crabs?"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"I feel like every few years it goes viral."
01:11:57;01:12:03;"Like a fisherman in Maine found a two-tone crab where like half is blue and half is red or something."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"You know, I never caught one like that."
01:12:05;01:12:12;"But I was in Bar Harbor like on an off day and I was like hanging out near the dock"
01:12:12;01:12:17;"and I overheard some other lobsterman telling his friend like, ""Yo, look at this lobster I caught."""
01:12:17;01:12:21;"And so I like talked my way into going down on the dock with them."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Yeah, they caught this like blue lobster."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"The whole thing was oceanic blue."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"It was pretty cool."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Very rare."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"I bet."
01:12:30;01:12:34;"Doesn't the lobsterman sound like some mid-60s garage band?"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Totally."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"It totally does."
01:12:37;01:12:44;"Yeah, some like band from coastal Massachusetts that maybe actually like their parents were lobstermen or something."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Pressed one seven inch."
01:12:46;01:12:54;"Honestly, it's almost giving me a flashback because back in the day I was so into like regional garage and surf compilations."
01:12:54;01:13:00;"You know, there's like the famous like Back from the Grave, but there'd be these even smaller regional ones."
01:13:00;01:13:04;"Like I had one that was just like northern New Jersey where I'm from."
01:13:04;01:13:12;"Just knowing that world pretty well that it actually makes so much sense that there would have been a coastal New England band"
01:13:12;01:13:18;"who would have been listening to all the California surf music and with that kind of like wry 60s sense of humor be like,"
01:13:18;01:13:22;"""We're not surfers up here. We are the lobstermen."""
01:13:22;01:13:26;"You know, like I guarantee there's something like that somewhere."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Oh, for sure. Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"Rare nuggets of coastal Maine garage rock and surf."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"1963 to 1966."
01:13:34;01:13:43;"My friend had the CD in his car of it was like specifically New England garage rock from the 60s."
01:13:43;01:13:51;"I can't remember if any was like nautical themes really, but it was this whole like CD and I was reading the liner notes and"
01:13:51;01:14:01;"every one of the bands was described as like they almost got the same chance that Jonathan Richman got or like they were almost as big as the Liars."
01:14:01;01:14:06;"And then this happened and it didn't work out and they, you know, broke up or whatever."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"I love those kinds of CDs though."
01:14:09;01:14:16;"Oh, yeah. Speaking of which, I vaguely remember this from whatever four elections ago."
01:14:16;01:14:20;"John Kerry, a consummate New Englander."
01:14:20;01:14:27;"He went to some fancy boarding school in New Hampshire and he was in a garage rock band and they recorded one or two songs."
01:14:27;01:14:28;"Really? Did he sing?"
01:14:28;01:14:35;"I don't know what he did. Can we get a number crunch on John Kerry's prep school garage rock band?"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Played bass poorly."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"I feel like maybe guitar or saxophone."
01:14:39;01:14:46;"Oh, New Hampshire prep school nuggets 1962 to 1965."
01:14:46;01:14:51;"So you're from Maine. So like, I don't think of Maine as a place that bands really tour to."
01:14:51;01:14:56;"Like, did you see like, did you start seeing rock shows regularly when you moved to Philly?"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Definitely a lot more."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Yeah."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Bands would come to Portland sometimes."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"I saw Dylan in Portland."
01:15:03;01:15:07;"I would see stuff like Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, like they would come up there."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Jonathan Richman came up quite a bit too."
01:15:09;01:15:12;"But yeah, a lot of bands seem to not."
01:15:12;01:15:18;"Do you feel a kinship with Jonathan Richman as a New Englander or is Massachusetts too far from Maine?"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"It's close enough for me. Yeah."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"I know he's a big fan of Maine too."
01:15:22;01:15:28;"He has some song where he's like, I've seen Israel's arid plain."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Sure, it's pretty, but so is Maine."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"I definitely feel a kinship with him."
01:15:33;01:15:34;"There's actually a funny story."
01:15:34;01:15:42;"So second grade's guitar player, John, he grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, which is the same town as Jonathan Richman."
01:15:42;01:15:46;"And they even like went to the same high school at different times."
01:15:46;01:15:55;"And so my friend John met Jonathan one time and he was like, yo, Jonathan, we went to the same high school."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"I think they should put a statue of you up in front of the high school."
01:15:58;01:16:07;"And Jonathan's response was, no, man, they ought to put a statue of you at the high school, which was."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"That's perfect."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Such a sweet Jonathan Richman."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"Like 100 percent just on brand."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Yeah."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"See, I come from Boston."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"I'm going to tell you all about how I love New England."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"It's my favorite place."
01:16:20;01:16:24;"I've been all around the world, but I love New England best."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"I might be prejudiced, but it's true."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I love New England."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"Well, I'll give you the bystroke."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"That's pretty good."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"Give me another one, though, without him."
01:16:37;01:16:43;"You know, ladies and gentlemen, I've already been to Paris."
01:16:43;01:16:47;"I've already been to Rome."
01:16:47;01:16:52;"And what did I do but miss my home?"
01:16:52;01:16:58;"I have been out west to California."
01:16:58;01:17:02;"But I missed the land where I was born."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"I can't help it."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Dum de dum de dum de dum de dum de."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Oh, New England."
01:17:08;01:17:11;"Dum de dum de dum de dum de dum de."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"Oh, New England."
01:17:12;01:17:13;"Ride a while, man."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Doo de doo de doo de doo de doo."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"Doo de doo de doo de doo de doo."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Doo de doo de doo de doo de doo."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Doo de doo de doo."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"I have seen old Israel's arid plain."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"Dum de dum de dum de dum de dum de."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"It's magnificent, but so's Maine."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Oh, New England."
01:17:32;01:17:35;"John Kerry played the bass."
01:17:35;01:17:36;"Nailed it."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"Oh, good call, Jake."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"What was the name of the band?"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"The Electras."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"Okay, perfect."
01:17:41;01:17:46;"Specifically, I think it's John Kerry and the Electras."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"[laughs]"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Oh, really?"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"John Kerry and the Electras."
01:17:51;01:17:58;"So, how did your northern New England sensibilities find Philly when you first moved there?"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"And also, how did you choose Philly as the place to move?"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"What's wrong with Boston?"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"[laughs]"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"Well, don't get me started."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Two cities that are often compared."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"Yeah, there's similarities."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"Yeah, for sure."
01:18:11;01:18:16;"I mean, I was ready to get out of the New England winters, so Philly suits me fine."
01:18:16;01:18:24;"We ended up here because Friendship's singer, Dan, he had gone to college around here at Haverford."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"And so, he was kind of familiar with Philly."
01:18:26;01:18:30;"He could vouch for it as being a cool spot to be a band."
01:18:30;01:18:33;"And that was kind of all the convincing that I needed."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"What year was that?"
01:18:35;01:18:40;"And that would have been like early 2015."
01:18:40;01:18:44;"So, yeah, is that like eight years ago, seven years ago?"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Yeah."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"How old are you?"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"I'm 31."
01:18:47;01:18:49;"Okay, so you moved down there at 24."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"And been here ever since, and not leaving anytime soon."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"Hell yeah."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"So, you moved down there with Friendship when you started second grade in Philly."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"I've only been to Philly twice."
01:19:00;01:19:08;"One was with Ezra and my brother when Dirty Projectors played a show at some bar there in 2005."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"And then the other time I went there on an eighth grade field trip because I'm from Connecticut."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"See the Liberty Bell?"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Exactly, I saw the Liberty Bell."
01:19:15;01:19:18;"But I see, you know, I reach Pitchfork over here."
01:19:18;01:19:24;"I see Philly referenced all the time as an amazing rock and roll town."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"And there's a lot of great bands from there."
01:19:26;01:19:32;"When you see that, do you kind of roll your eyes or are you sort of like, ""No, that tracks. Philly is an amazing..."""
01:19:32;01:19:36;"Because it kind of has a Portland 20 years ago kind of feel to it."
01:19:36;01:19:39;"Or that's the impression that I get."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"Hmm."
01:19:40;01:19:42;"Yeah, I think it tracks."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Yeah, I think there's..."
01:19:43;01:19:48;"I mean, there's like the handful of bands that get a lot of attention in Philly."
01:19:48;01:19:50;"And I'm happy for those bands for sure."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"They deserve it. They're doing great stuff."
01:19:52;01:19:56;"Who are the big Philly bands or like the getting a lot of..."
01:19:56;01:19:59;"Like Kurt Vile or that's kind of a different generation?"
01:19:59;01:20:04;"It is a different generation, but he still is like very beloved here and elsewhere."
01:20:04;01:20:08;"And sort of seen as like an ambassador of Philly rock, I guess."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"And maybe like the War on Drugs too."
01:20:10;01:20:14;"I guess they live in LA now though, so maybe not."
01:20:14;01:20:19;"Like Alex G is like the hometown hero."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"Oh, right, right."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Right now, for sure."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Sheermag?"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"And Sheermag, yeah, Sheermag."
01:20:24;01:20:27;"I haven't heard from them in a little bit though."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Yeah."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Maybe there's some new music."
01:20:30;01:20:35;"A lot of the people you referenced, I think, are like born and raised Pennsylvanians."
01:20:35;01:20:40;"Does it ever get weird being a main guy in Philly?"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"I don't perceive any weirdness."
01:20:42;01:20:47;"I don't know, maybe people have it out for me behind my back because I'm not..."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"In the scene?"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"It's possible."
01:20:49;01:20:53;"Did you know he's not even from Pennsylvania?"
01:20:53;01:20:59;"But then it's like, the response to that is like, ""Okay, I could have stayed in Maine and played music,"
01:20:59;01:21:02;"but how many musicians can you name from Maine?"""
01:21:02;01:21:04;"And the list is pretty short."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"What's his name?"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"American Pie."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Don McLean?"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Don McLean's from Maine?"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Yeah, Don McLean."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Whoa."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Well, he lives in Maine."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"He's a longtime Maine resident."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Oh, interesting."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Wow."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"I did not know that."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"It's also funny to me, there's something interesting about you going from Maine to Philly because,"
01:21:21;01:21:30;"no disrespect to Delaware, Washington, D.C., but to me, the East Coast that I really know and understand"
01:21:30;01:21:33;"starts in Philly and ends in Maine."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"You know what I mean?"
01:21:34;01:21:38;"I truly feel like once you get past Philly, it's something else."
01:21:38;01:21:42;"Of course, there's a kinship, but Delaware and D.C., that's like..."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"Mid-Atlantic."
01:21:43;01:21:49;"Yeah, Mid-Atlantic, whereas Philly, New York, and Boston are the three true big East Coast cities,"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"and then Maine is part of, obviously, the New England region."
01:21:52;01:21:59;"I think people should write a free passage from one place to the other without getting any guff."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Oh, totally."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"Yeah, that feels right to me."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"Hey, Peter, are you zipping something?"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"There's some crazy sound on your side."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:22:07;01:22:13;"I'm about to be on the move here because this dog suit just ended."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Oh, I see."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Walk and talk, walk and talk."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"I might have to walk and talk."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Is that okay?"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Of course."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"I just think you were like..."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"You were just getting a tiny bit noisy."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"Were you moving the zipper on your jacket or something?"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I might have been, yeah."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"All right."
01:22:28;01:22:32;"Is it possible to call back in in like five minutes?"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Sure, I think so."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"We're going to lose you in ten minutes."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"I'm going to be gone, but great to meet you, Peter."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"I'll be here."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"I'll be here to wrap things up."
01:22:40;01:22:41;"I hope I can catch a show one day."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Oh, thank you so much."
01:22:42;01:22:43;"Have a good one."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Yeah, good talking to you."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"All right, peace."
01:22:45;01:22:50;"I'm actually really into the kind of like community radio vibe of just like having a guest on"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"and being like, ""Well, you know, I'm dog sitting."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Can I call you back in five?"""
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Absolutely."
01:22:56;01:22:59;"You know, there was this one, I was listening to this one Lana."
01:22:59;01:23:05;"She doesn't do that many, but there was this one Lana Del Rey interview I was listening to."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"It was on BBC."
01:23:06;01:23:11;"And you hear like ding dong, and she's like, ""Oh, there's some guy here for the chimney,"""
01:23:11;01:23:12;"or something like that."
01:23:12;01:23:15;"And she leaves, and this whole thing keeps while she's doing this interview."
01:23:15;01:23:20;"There is something very fun about, you know, real life."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:23:21;01:23:27;"People should bring more of that energy to BBC interviews, CNN, just like not everything"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"has to be so fast paced."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"It should be like, ""Hold on a minute."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"I got to take something out of the oven."""
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Postmates is here."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"All right."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"So, Jake, you're going to have to land the plane today."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"I got to leave a little bit early."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"But I think this will be interesting because it doesn't happen that often."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Yeah."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"I got to jump."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Speaking of community radio, I got to go."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"Got to go on a field trip with my son."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"You guys land the plane."
01:23:53;01:23:56;"Where do you recommend, Jake, that people start with Second Grid?"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"I mean, they have three albums."
01:23:59;01:24:05;"The new one's great, and the one before that, Hit to Hit, is really great."
01:24:05;01:24:08;"I've been listening to the new one a ton the last few weeks."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Really like it."
01:24:09;01:24:13;"Why don't we throw on Kramer in LA, the aforementioned Kramer in LA for a second."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"This is definitely sort of a left field track."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"But that's what I like about this band."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"There's a lot of left field ideas."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"Let's throw it on."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"Right."
01:24:21;01:24:27;"Like this is not the most typical Second Grid vibe, but it's appropriate for this show."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Yeah."
01:24:44;01:24:49;"Hello Jerry, it's me, Kramer."
01:24:49;01:24:55;"I write you from 3,000 miles away."
01:24:55;01:25:07;"You may recall in the previous episode that I packed up and moved to LA."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Life here's crazy."
01:25:09;01:25:12;"I'm doing the Hollywood hustle."
01:25:12;01:25:17;"Working hard and trying to catch a break."
01:25:17;01:25:22;"But between the smog strangler and being made fun of on The Tonight Show,"
01:25:22;01:25:28;"I don't know how much more of this I can take."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"I miss my old place."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"I miss your place too."
01:25:33;01:25:39;"I wish I could just burst right through that door."
01:25:39;01:25:45;"I miss Elaine and that crazy George Gustavza."
01:25:45;01:25:52;"Hell, I even miss Newman."
01:25:52;01:25:57;"So goodnight to the city that never sleeps."
01:25:57;01:26:04;"As distant as the hills of yesterday."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"Goodbye Jerry Seinfeld."
01:26:06;01:26:09;"Goodbye New York City."
01:26:09;01:26:17;"Sincerely, Kramer in LA."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Great ending."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"Sincerely, Kramer in LA."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Touch it."
01:26:23;01:26:27;"Even though that song obviously kind of takes place in LA,"
01:26:27;01:26:32;"I just had a vision of myself, maybe because I'm still thinking about Clam Chowder and Little Cranberry Island,"
01:26:32;01:26:37;"just being in a little cabin by myself on Little Cranberry Island after a hard day's work,"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"making a bowl of clam chowder for one,"
01:26:40;01:26:45;"listening to that song on the radio, on the community radio,"
01:26:45;01:26:49;"and then just putting out my candle, getting some shut eye."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Putting on your sleeping cap."
01:26:51;01:26:56;"You know, I hope that local DJ has followed Peter's career,"
01:26:56;01:27:01;"and he's playing second grade and friendship tunes on that radio show."
01:27:01;01:27:05;"To the next generation of Little Cranberry lobstermen."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Yeah. Should we try calling him back?"
01:27:07;01:27:11;"Okay, well then I'm going to jump off at this juncture."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Great seeing everybody."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Great to see you."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"Have fun, sweet potato picking."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"Thank you."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"All right."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"I know you're going to do a great job landing this plane."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"See you guys next time."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"Peace."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"We're going to land this plane."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Bye."
01:27:24;01:27:28;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:27:28;01:27:31;"(phone ringing)"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Okay, so we've lost Ezra."
01:27:33;01:27:37;"This is a weird episode that you're involved in, Peter."
01:27:37;01:27:40;"We've lost Ezra, who's the flagship of the brand."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"He's the hand of the brand, and we've lost him."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"Some might say he is the brand."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"He is the brand."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"It is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:27:48;01:27:52;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:27:52;01:27:57;"But right now it's Time Crisis with Jake, Seinfeld, Nick, and Peter."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"But it's fine."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"We covered Maine."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"It's all good."
01:28:00;01:28:05;"I wanted to say I'm nervous to have you on, man, because I'm a huge fan."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Oh, my God."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"I've listened to your music so much the last few years."
01:28:09;01:28:12;"I texted the people all the time, ""Have you heard this album?"""
01:28:12;01:28:15;"I'm like a one-man cheering section over here."
01:28:15;01:28:19;"So really cool to meet you over the internet here."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Wow, yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Thank you so much."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"That's so good to hear."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Yeah, wow."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"I love all three records."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"I love the new one."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"One thing-- okay, here's a question."
01:28:28;01:28:32;"I've been reading the press and stuff around your band."
01:28:32;01:28:40;"The term ""power pop"" gets thrown around so much, and I've always found that term a little slippery."
01:28:40;01:28:44;"I think of individual songs as being kind of power pop."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"Certainly songs within your catalog would fit into that."
01:28:47;01:28:53;"I don't think of you guys as a power pop band, because you have so many different ideas."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"There's more humor in your music."
01:28:55;01:28:59;"You have these beautiful ballads, which I don't really think of as power pop."
01:28:59;01:29:05;"So to you, what's a quintessential power pop album or artist?"
01:29:05;01:29:13;"Yeah, well, it's such an interesting question, because the first one that jumps to mind for me is Big Star,"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"and probably a Big Star's first record."
01:29:16;01:29:22;"But then if you start thinking about what is power pop and you come up with a definition,"
01:29:22;01:29:26;"suddenly Big Star doesn't even fit into that category anymore."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"I've always been confused as them seeing them classified as power pop."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Is the Ballad of El Gudu on that?"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"Yeah, it's on number one record."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"To me, that's like-- I don't know."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"It's not the lyrics are weird."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"I don't know."
01:29:41;01:29:46;"I just find that-- to me, power pop is sort of like Beatles-y or something."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:29:48;01:29:53;"Yeah, I think classic power pop is like McCartney-esque, kind of."
01:29:53;01:29:59;"It is derived from '65 and before, like Beatles."
01:29:59;01:30:04;"And it's like later bands trying to recreate that snappy guitar sound,"
01:30:04;01:30:10;"which, yeah, is totally not what Big Star is about, which is-- yeah, it's so interesting."
01:30:10;01:30:16;"I think for me, my personal definition of the kind of power pop I want to pursue"
01:30:16;01:30:22;"is that Big Star kind of sound where there's a lot of ballads and it's very jangly"
01:30:22;01:30:28;"and it isn't as formulaic or scientific of pop songs."
01:30:28;01:30:35;"But for some reason, Big Star isn't power pop, but it also-- it is."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"I guess that was my entry point to the genre, too."
01:30:38;01:30:42;"But yeah, it is a slippery slope, absolutely."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"Yeah, as a fan, I just don't like seeing you guys boxed in."
01:30:45;01:30:48;"That's fair. I appreciate that."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"I think I did it to us."
01:30:51;01:30:56;"I was probably the first one telling everyone that we're power pop"
01:30:56;01:31:00;"just because it felt like an easy box to put us in"
01:31:00;01:31:04;"to get people excited about it maybe or listening to it in the first place."
01:31:04;01:31:08;"Well, right, and it's more specific than indie rock."
01:31:08;01:31:12;"We'll go to bed, you guys. Indie."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Yeah, pretty useless term."
01:31:14;01:31:18;"It's tough. People sometimes ask me, ""Oh, you're a musician."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"What kind of music do you play?"""
01:31:20;01:31:23;"And if the person asking me is a musician,"
01:31:23;01:31:28;"I can get deep into the minutia of different subgenres."
01:31:28;01:31:34;"But if it's someone that is not a musician, I usually say, ""Oh, I play indie rock."""
01:31:34;01:31:36;"And usually they go, ""Oh, cool, cool."""
01:31:36;01:31:41;"Like your parents' friends, you're like, ""Yeah, it's like--"
01:31:41;01:31:46;"I like talking to people that have no frame of reference past the '70s."
01:31:46;01:31:49;"You're just like, ""Yeah, it's kind of like the Beatles."""
01:31:49;01:31:54;"Yeah, just grasping for any frame of reference that they can understand."

01:33:07;01:33:09;"And I think Seinfeld maybe wants to jump in too."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Seinfeld, do you have a--"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Do you want to go back and forth, actually?"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"Because it might be kind of funny to go Seinfeld, then GBV."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"Okay, okay."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"I know you're a big GBV head."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"I'm going to read you five song titles."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"One of them is a real GBV song."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"[laughs]"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"All right."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"I'm testing you."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Yeah."
01:33:28;01:33:32;"Okay, the first one, ""The Crab Leg Birthday Zeitgeist,"""
01:33:32;01:33:35;"""Princess Anne Avenue,"""
01:33:35;01:33:37;"""Impact Driver,"""
01:33:37;01:33:40;"""Juggernaut vs. Monolith,"""
01:33:40;01:33:42;"""Goat Yoga."""
01:33:42;01:33:44;"I'm going-- The real one is four,"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"""Juggernaut vs. Monolith."""
01:33:46;01:33:47;"Okay, damn, you know."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"[exhales]"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"You know what that's off?"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"No, I don't."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"I know I've seen it before."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"It's off ""Suitcase 3."""
01:33:55;01:33:57;"""Suitcase 3,"" okay."
01:33:57;01:33:58;"[laughs]"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"Yeah, not one I've spent too much time with."
01:34:01;01:34:04;"All right, all my questions are about ""The Trip,"""
01:34:04;01:34:08;"which is the Kramer in LA episode, obviously."
01:34:08;01:34:11;"All right, much of Kramer in LA happens in the two-part episode, ""The Trip."""
01:34:11;01:34:15;"Which core Seinfeld cast member does not appear in this episode,"
01:34:15;01:34:20;"which is one of the only three episodes this actor did not appear in from the whole series?"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"Name that actor, and why were they not in the episode?"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"[laughs]"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"Would it be Elaine?"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Yes, nailed it."
01:34:29;01:34:32;"But why is she not in it?"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Is she afraid of flying?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"That's a good guess."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"She was on maternity leave."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Oh, okay. Wow."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"That's cool."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Okay, this is more of like--"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"not really a trivia question, this is more just like--"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"you know, we're just talking."
01:34:47;01:34:50;"Off the top of your head, top three ""Eagles"" songs."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"[laughs]"
01:34:51;01:34:55;"Let's go ""Take It Easy,"" ""Life in the Fast Lane,"""
01:34:55;01:34:59;"which I wish I could already take it off the top three, but I said it."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"You can take it off."
01:35:01;01:35:05;"I'll take ""Life in the Fast Lane"" out of there."
01:35:05;01:35:09;"I'm putting ""Take It to the Limit"" in the two slot."
01:35:09;01:35:13;"And number three, we're going to go with ""Already Gone."""
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Oh, interesting. Okay."
01:35:15;01:35:18;"Mm-hmm, which is one I always forget about."
01:35:18;01:35:22;"So you're more of like the early country rock side."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Yeah, I guess. Yeah."
01:35:24;01:35:28;"Like ""Greatest Hits Vol. 1,"" I guess is what all those are."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"All right, my question is multiple choice."
01:35:30;01:35:34;"At one point in the trip, Kramer runs into a '90s television actor"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"and freaks him out."
01:35:36;01:35:40;"Who was the actor? Is it A, Tony Danza, B, Fred Savage,"
01:35:40;01:35:44;"C, Martin Lawrence, or D, Dave Coulier?"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"Uh, is it Martin Lawrence?"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Oh, I wish it was."
01:35:49;01:35:52;"It's Fred Savage of ""The Wonder Years."""
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Okay."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"Actually, that was based on a real experience by writer Larry Charles,"
01:35:57;01:36:01;"who once approached Richard Dreyfuss in a bookstore to pitch a script."
01:36:01;01:36:05;"According to Charles, ""I was so excited I started to hyperventilate."
01:36:05;01:36:08;"I said, 'Don't be scared of me.'"""
01:36:08;01:36:09;"[laughs]"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"Which is what Kramer says to Fred Savage in that episode."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"Right, right. Wow."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Thoughts on ""The Dead""?"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"I love ""The Dead."""
01:36:19;01:36:22;"""The Dead"" was a big part of my soundtrack growing up"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"because my stepdad was obsessed with ""The Dead."""
01:36:25;01:36:28;"The other half of that is Jimmy Buffett."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"My dad was obsessed with Jimmy Buffett."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"So those were like my two guiding lights for a long, long time."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Is there a specific--"
01:36:36;01:36:39;"What's your favorite ""Dead"" kind of avenue?"
01:36:39;01:36:44;"Well, growing up, I was obsessed with ""Terrapin Station"" for some reason."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"Oh, wow."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"I don't really know why,"
01:36:47;01:36:51;"but nowadays I'm much more of an American beauty kind of guy."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Yeah, I mean, undeniable."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"During a visit to ""The Tonight Show"" in that episode,"
01:36:57;01:37:01;"George Costanza runs into ""Cheers"" actor George Wendt"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"and criticizes an aspect of the show ""Cheers."""
01:37:04;01:37:09;"What part of the show ""Cheers"" does George have a problem with?"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"[laughs]"
01:37:11;01:37:14;"Uh, oh, geez."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Yeah, I got no idea."
01:37:16;01:37:18;"It's the fact that it's set at a bar."
01:37:18;01:37:21;"The line is, ""Enough with the bar already."""
01:37:21;01:37:23;"[laughs]"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"I can picture that."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"It's genius."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"It's a good moment."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"""Siamese"" or ""Melancholy""?"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"""Siamese."""
01:37:32;01:37:34;"It's more focused, I guess,"
01:37:34;01:37:38;"and just has some of my favorite moments from them."
01:37:38;01:37:44;"I always remember hearing ""Today"" for the very first time in headphones."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"And, you know, the intro is so quiet with that guitar,"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"and I cranked it up, like, ""Why is it so quiet?"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"Is something wrong with my CD player?"""
01:37:53;01:37:55;"And then just getting blasted with noise,"
01:37:55;01:37:58;"and it's like, ""Oh, they got me real good there."""
01:37:58;01:38:00;"I always respected that move."
01:38:00;01:38:03;"Yeah. I mean, they're the kings of that."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"I'll do one more, and by the way, I love the song."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"I was listening to it a lot today."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"Thanks."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"At one point in the trip to L.A.,"
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Kramer is seen in a montage in Venice,"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"engaging in which recreational activity?"
01:38:17;01:38:22;"A. Skateboarding, B. Surfing, C. Roller skating, D. Hang gliding."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"I think it's roller skating?"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"Yes."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"All right, yeah."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Very Kramer."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Yeah, totally."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"Nice."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"I got to swing back to GBV,"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"because they're one of my favorites of all time."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Yeah, me too."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"Top five Pollard releases."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"Could be GBV, could be Psy Projects,"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"could be Circus Devils. I don't care."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"Just top five."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Wow. Here we go."
01:38:46;01:38:47;"This is a tough one."
01:38:47;01:38:50;"They're probably all going to be GBV for me."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"And, I mean, right off the bat,"
01:38:52;01:38:56;"three of them are going to be taken up by your B-1000,"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"your Alien Lanes,"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"and your Under the Bushes, Under the Stars."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Straight up."
01:39:01;01:39:05;"Yeah, I cannot deny those three."
01:39:05;01:39:10;"For the final two, let's go with, goodness."
01:39:10;01:39:14;"I am quite partial to, what's that one called?"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"Sunfish Holy Breakfast?"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Yeah."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"That one's beautiful."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"There's some really beautiful ballads on there."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Mm-hmm."
01:39:22;01:39:27;"And I really stan Do the Collapse."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Interesting."
01:39:28;01:39:32;"Which I know some people would say it might be their worst album,"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"but it has some real high points for me."
01:39:34;01:39:40;"Surgical Focus is probably one of my all-time favorite GBV songs."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Yep, that one's amazing."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"As is Things That I Will Keep."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"That song, I think it's like track three or whatever."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"That song is genius."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I'm a big fan of Wrecking Now."
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Wrecking Now."
01:39:54;01:39:57;"Yeah, who writes a melody like that?"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Pretty incredible."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:00;01:40:04;"I could say no way"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"But she's calling out my voice"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:08;01:40:13;"And so I'm through with you"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"She's bleeding now"
01:40:17;01:40:21;"She's repeating now"
01:40:21;01:40:25;"She's defeating now"
01:40:25;01:40:29;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Have you seen them live?"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"No, I haven't."
01:40:33;01:40:36;"I had tickets to see them in Atlantic City this summer,"
01:40:36;01:40:39;"and then the show just got canceled for some reason."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Huh."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"So that was a bummer."
01:40:41;01:40:44;"And they're coming back to Philly in December,"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"but the problem is they're playing with Dinosaur Jr."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"Yeah."
01:40:48;01:40:53;"I like Dinosaur Jr., but I don't want to lose my hearing that way."
01:40:53;01:40:57;"And I also just want to see the whole unadulterated GBV set."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"I don't want to have it cut with another band."
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Do you know who's playing first?"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"Or are they alternating?"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I don't know, actually."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"Yeah, maybe I'll look into it."
01:41:08;01:41:12;"I saw Dinosaur Jr. in GBV this past year"
01:41:12;01:41:16;"at Pappy and Harriet's, which is a great outdoor venue in the desert,"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"which second grade should play."
01:41:18;01:41:21;"Dinosaur's not as loud as they used to."
01:41:21;01:41:26;"I mean, I never saw them in the 90s when they were really fabled for their volume."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"It was pretty normal."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Oh, okay. That's good to know."
01:41:30;01:41:36;"Those guys are old, too, so it's like they can't be doing what they were doing 30 years ago, volume-wise."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Word."
01:41:37;01:41:40;"So I would say go to that show."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Well, all right, yeah."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"Now I'm considering it, for sure."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Because I like them. Yeah, I like the records a lot."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Do you think you guys are going to hit the road next year?"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Oh, totally. Yeah."
01:41:51;01:41:54;"There's no plans currently set in stone,"
01:41:54;01:41:57;"but I know that we've got to get out there for sure."
01:41:57;01:42:00;"I mean, I would love to do the whole U.S."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Yeah."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"If we can swing it."
01:42:02;01:42:06;"I've never toured west of the Dakotas before,"
01:42:06;01:42:10;"so I'm really dying to get to California,"
01:42:10;01:42:13;"get to the whole west coast, and do the whole thing."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Yeah, fingers crossed."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"I hope it happens."
01:42:16;01:42:20;"Oh, I saw you're playing with Dear Nora in Philly."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"Yeah, we're so psyched for that."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"I love Dear Nora."
01:42:23;01:42:26;"I love all the new songs I've heard so far."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Katie's a really old friend of mine."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"I used to play in that band."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"I know, yeah. Yeah, yeah."
01:42:30;01:42:36;"Circa late 90s and then circa '04, '05, '06."
01:42:36;01:42:39;"Yeah, so cool, that connection."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"I know, it's crazy."
01:42:40;01:42:44;"So yeah, you can tell that I'm a professional radio."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"[laughs]"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"You're doing great, yeah."
01:42:47;01:42:49;"Matt, should we do the top five?"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Yeah, let's do it."
01:42:50;01:42:57;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"We're going to do the top five Billboard 100"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"from this week in 1991."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Why '91?"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Why 1991, Seinfeld?"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"It's the year that Peter Gill, our guest, was born."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Yeah, hello."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"[laughs]"
01:43:10;01:43:13;"Before we get going, I just want to do a quick check-in"
01:43:13;01:43:16;"with Jake and see how you're feeling about flying this plane."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"It's happening."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"You know, it's a little shaky."
01:43:18;01:43:21;"It's not as smooth as it normally is with Ezra here,"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"but I feel like we're doing all right."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"I feel like the vibe of the show immediately changed."
01:43:25;01:43:28;"It's become a little bit more relaxed."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"I think it's going great, Jake."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Okay."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"I appreciate that."
01:43:33;01:43:35;"I mean, both versions are great."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"The Reese's Winter Blessing is teasing me."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"This is TZ After Dark."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"It definitely has a very--"
01:43:42;01:43:47;"It has, like, yeah, kind of what Peter was talking about."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Get comfortable."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Yeah, community radio vibes."
01:43:50;01:43:54;"It's the Reese's Winter Recipe of TZ."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"Zero to ten, though."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"How do you rate how you're doing?"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"And this is not to be critical."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"I just said this is a check-in."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"I'm at, like, a four or five."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"[laughs]"
01:44:05;01:44:08;"I think it's a solid 7.5."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Okay."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Great."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"I'm not weighing in."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"I'm just taking stock."

01:44:24;01:44:25;"My mom had this record."
01:44:25;01:44:29;"And we would clean up the kitchen and wash dishes to this."
01:44:47;01:44:51;"Since we have Peter here and we've been talking so much about Seinfeld,"
01:44:51;01:44:56;"doesn't this remind you of the episode where Jerry's gone"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"and all the friends kind of have to hang out without their --"
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Yes."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"[laughs]"

01:45:03;01:45:04;"Yeah."

01:45:05;01:45:06;"They bond over --"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"They're trying to figure out how to engage with each other."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"[laughs]"
01:45:09;01:45:13;"And don't they bond over, like, gossiping about Jerry?"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"[laughs]"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Yeah."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"I'm waiting --"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Yeah, so we just [bleep] talk as we are for the rest of the show."

01:45:29;01:45:31;"My thoughts on Bonnie Raitt?"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"Yeah."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Are you familiar with this one?"
01:45:33;01:45:37;"So, you know, I think she's an awesome guitar player."
01:45:37;01:45:42;"Her songs, from a songwriting standpoint, just usually don't do it for me."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"This one's okay."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"But I want more guitar."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"This was written by Shirley Elkhard."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"I think this is the record --"
01:45:50;01:45:54;"My favorite Bonnie Raitt song is the ballad, ""I Can't Make You Love Me."""
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Classic, yeah."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"That one's just -- That one hits hard every time."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"Okay."
01:46:08;01:46:14;"Number four, a little East Coast rock extreme, off the album ""Porno Graffiti,"""
01:46:14;01:46:16;"which is just a rough album title, folks."

01:46:17;01:46:19;"We have the single ""Wholehearted."""
01:46:28;01:46:30;"This is really, truly the end."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"I remember watching this video a lot on MTV."
01:46:33;01:46:37;"Here's a rough fact."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"He wrote this song on the toilet."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"[laughs]"
01:46:42;01:46:47;"This is really the last gasp of that kind of hair metal era."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Oh, interesting."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"He's saying, okay, ""Knew no Betancourt."""
01:46:54;01:46:56;"He wrote it on the toilet."
01:46:56;01:46:59;"I was listening to Led Zeppelin III a lot at the time,"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"and there was a lot of acoustic stuff on there."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"So I kind of took the groove a little bit,"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"borrowed that feel from being inspired by Zeppelin III,"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"which is a great vibe."
01:47:08;01:47:11;"This doesn't have the Zeppelin III feel to me,"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"but I do love that as a touchstone."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"What's your favorite Zeppelin album, Peter?"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"My favorite is Zeppelin III, yeah."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"That was the first album I ever owned."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"That was your intro?"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Wow."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Yeah, it was my intro."
01:47:32;01:47:38;"I think Zeppelin III was done at Arden Studios right before Big Star recorded there."
01:47:38;01:47:42;"It was the acoustic sounds on Zeppelin III"
01:47:42;01:47:46;"influenced a lot of the acoustic sounds on Big Star stuff."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"So is that in Memphis?"
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Yeah, in Memphis."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"I didn't know that."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"I mean, that's a classic trope, right?"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"The British rock star going to the American South."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"The heart of the blues, yeah."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"I didn't know that."
01:48:00;01:48:01;"That's so cool."
01:48:01;01:48:06;"Yeah, and I think Terry Manning worked on both bands' records"
01:48:06;01:48:10;"and helped them get the same acoustic sounds."
01:48:10;01:48:15;"I wonder, do you think the guys in Zeppelin ever heard Big Star?"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Oh, that's so interesting to think about."
01:48:18;01:48:22;"If Jimmy Page is checking in with that engineer in Memphis,"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"and he's like, ""What are you working on these days?"""
01:48:24;01:48:26;"And he's like, ""Well, I just recorded this band Big Star."""
01:48:26;01:48:32;"Jimmy Page, they went to someone's apartment and just played records."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"I forget where I read that."
01:48:34;01:48:39;"Sometimes I wonder, too, has Justin Bieber listened to Big Star?"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"Or stuff like that."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"Who knows?"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Paul McCartney."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"I have a question for Peter."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Have you listened to Time Crisis before?"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"I haven't."
01:48:50;01:48:54;"This is my first taste."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"I'm just not a podcast guy."
01:48:55;01:48:58;"So you have nothing to compare how this experience is going"
01:48:58;01:49:02;"versus episodes you've listened to."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"Yeah, I have nothing to compare it to."
01:49:06;01:49:10;"Well, basically wondering if Justin Bieber has listened to Big Star."
01:49:10;01:49:13;"That's pretty much what this show is."
01:49:13;01:49:16;"Just speculating on, like, ""Has this person heard this?"""
01:49:16;01:49:20;"""Did Led Zeppelin listen to Big Star?"""
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Very cool."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"I'm not a podcast guy, but I'm having a good time here."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Peter, I've got to correct you there."
01:49:27;01:49:30;"This is actually not a podcast."
01:49:30;01:49:34;"I'd be remiss if I didn't just issue the corrective."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"This is an internet radio show."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:49:37;01:49:41;"Don't shoot the messenger, but it's an important distinction."
01:49:41;01:49:45;"No, it's a hard lesson, but I'm glad you went there, Seinfeld."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Thank you."
01:49:46;01:49:51;"Next, number three, this week of 1991, Karen White, romantic."
01:49:51;01:49:56;"Not familiar with this."
01:49:56;01:50:00;"Off the album Ritual of Love."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"Okay."
01:50:01;01:50:05;"I mean, this is just, like, classic palette from this era."
01:50:34;01:50:43;"I like that this song is called ""Romantic."""
01:50:43;01:50:46;"That seems like--"
01:50:46;01:50:51;"Well, I also find it fascinating, like, speaking of Bob Pollard,"
01:50:51;01:50:55;"how he'll usually write from--he'll have, like, the titles first, you know?"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"Which I think is a really interesting way to work,"
01:50:59;01:51:03;"and I just love to think about the idea of writing a song called ""Romantic."""
01:51:03;01:51:05;"[laughs]"
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Yeah."
01:51:06;01:51:09;"I want to hear a second-grade song called ""Romantic."""
01:51:09;01:51:11;"We'll try to make that happen, yeah."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Yeah."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Here's a fun fact."
01:51:14;01:51:19;"White recorded a follow-up to Ritual of Love, '94's ""Make Him Do Right."""
01:51:19;01:51:22;"The album bombed, and White left the music industry"
01:51:22;01:51:26;"to run an interior design and real estate business and raise her daughter."
01:51:26;01:51:30;"She returned in 2012 to release her fourth album, Carpe Diem."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"Yeah, man."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Do with that info what you will."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Yeah."
01:51:34;01:51:37;"She had a moment in the sun and then bounced."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"Respect."
01:51:39;01:51:44;"All right, the number two song from this week in '91."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"I'm not familiar with this either."

01:52:05;01:52:06;"This sounds sick."
01:52:06;01:52:20;"[drums]"
01:52:20;01:52:24;"""Do Anything"" was written and recorded on a four-track recorder in Minnesota."
01:52:24;01:52:30;"The song sat unfinished until Elliot Erickson began working on it again in '89."
01:52:30;01:52:33;"I like the idea of lo-fi R&B."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Wow."
01:52:47;01:52:54;"So when a baby Peter Gill is being born in that main hospital."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"[laughter]"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"Yeah, man."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"This is playing in the waiting room."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"It's playing in the cafeteria."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"Wow."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"Yeah, I don't think I ever heard this song ever."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"It's new to me."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"I like this."
01:53:06;01:53:13;"In 1990, there was a version of this song that was a local hit on Minnesota's W-L-O-L."
01:53:13;01:53:18;"That's actually an amazing call sign, W-L-O-L."
01:53:18;01:53:22;"Where Erickson worked as a remix engineer, so she worked at the station."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"She played her own stuff."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"That's cool."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"Wow."
01:53:53;01:53:57;"I'm hearing a little of that Minnesota Prince energy."
01:53:57;01:53:58;"Okay."

01:54:14;01:54:21;"And Peter, I don't know if you know this, but Jake is, on the record, a very big Mariah fan."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Oh, I love Mariah."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Really?"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"How do you feel?"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"I can't say I'm really familiar."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"I don't know if I've heard this song ever."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Oh, you've heard this."
01:54:33;01:54:36;"Wait, is that Nick, are you being facetious, or is Jake real?"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Are you real Mariah Carey?"
01:54:38;01:54:45;"I feel that every time Mariah's come up, he has always stood behind."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"I mean..."
01:54:46;01:54:52;"Okay, because I just can't help but recall the moment when Jake had never heard ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."""
01:54:52;01:54:53;"That's true."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"That's true, but that is a standard."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"Okay."
01:54:57;01:55:04;"I would say, on the record, as original Mariah Carey tracks, it is amazing that he, as a fan,"
01:55:04;01:55:09;"I would say even more amazing that, as a fan, he had never heard her most popular song."
01:55:09;01:55:10;"Fair."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"That's what made it stand out even more, was the fact that..."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"Got it."
01:55:36;01:55:40;"Oh yeah, what's going on with that grunge album that Mariah recorded?"
01:55:40;01:55:41;"That's coming out, right?"
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Oh yeah."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"We gotta, when that comes out, we gotta..."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"On paper, it's amazing."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Peter, have you heard about this?"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"No, I haven't."
01:55:48;01:55:54;"Apparently, Mariah Carey recorded an alt-rock record in the '90s, mid-'90s."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"And it never came out?"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"It was buried."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Oh wow."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"I'm dying to hear it."
01:56:13;01:56:18;"Didn't you all kind of expect, since Ezra handed over the keys, you might just give"

01:56:33;01:56:34;"You know?"
01:56:34;01:56:37;"He sort of handed it off."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"Good episode."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Good ep."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"You know, I'm also fairly confident he's never going to listen to it either."

01:58:17;01:58:18;"Ooh."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Sully Tully."
01:58:22;01:58:27;"All right, now, before-- Jake has a huge job ahead of him, and I do want to know if before"
01:58:27;01:58:32;"we actually officially end, he'd want to rehearse some of this."
01:58:32;01:58:35;"No, Ezra already taped the intro."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"Oh, damn, I was excited."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"But maybe I should tape my own version."
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Well, let's say Ezra hadn't taped the intro."
01:58:42;01:58:43;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"I mean, Matt, maybe you could play both back to back."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"But let's run through it."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"All right, let's-- we're, you know--"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"No, I mean, he does it off the cuff. I can do it off the cuff."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Let's go. All right."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"Oh, yeah."
01:58:52;01:58:53;"So let's hear how some of this would go."
01:58:53;01:58:56;"This is-- so you want to say goodbye to everybody?"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"It's not how it would go."
01:58:58;01:58:59;"It's how it's going to go."
01:58:59;01:59:00;"I'm going to do this in one take."
01:59:00;01:59:01;"OK."
01:59:01;01:59:04;"I'm putting my tray in my upright and locked position right now."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"OK."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"I'm getting buckled up."
01:59:07;01:59:12;"Time crisis."
01:59:12;01:59:19;"On this week's Time Crisis, Ezra calls in from Japan and has to bail early."
01:59:19;01:59:23;"In this episode, we discuss the saga of Dean and DeLuca."
01:59:23;01:59:28;"We discuss the epic journey of the Tully's brand."
01:59:28;01:59:33;"Peter Gill from my favorite band, Second Grade, calls in to discuss Power Pop,"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"Guided by Voices, and Seinfeld."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"This is--"
01:59:37;01:59:41;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Oh!"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Oh, wow."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"It almost was a touch and go landing, though."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"I really did think you were going to overshoot it."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"Oh, my god."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"I did overshoot it a little bit, but we got there."
01:59:52;01:59:57;"The plane has been landed, guys, so let's go out with easy listening by Second Grade."
01:59:57;01:59:59;"If you're in LA, November 4th--"
01:59:59;02:00:00;"I just thought of this--"
02:00:00;02:00:06;"Mountain Brews is doing their vinyl record release at Permanent Records Roadhouse."
02:00:06;02:00:08;"So that's November 4th if you're in LA."
02:00:08;02:00:09;"Come on out."
02:00:09;02:00:10;"It's going to be fun."
02:00:10;02:00:11;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""MOUNTAIN BREWS""]"
02:00:11;02:00:20;"When I float down the stream, dreaming a dream of easy listening,"
02:00:20;02:00:28;"it's so hard for me to tell you what I really mean."
02:00:28;02:00:37;"Adding up the score, forgetting you're a poet in a war,"
02:00:37;02:00:45;"doing the dishes in a different place, I found my lucky number in a database."
02:01:00;02:01:05;"My friends don't seem to mind."
02:01:05;02:01:09;"I'm in the 1990s all the time."
02:01:09;02:01:17;"It's so hard for me to tell them, but they don't seem to mind."
02:01:17;02:01:21;"What did you expect?"
02:01:21;02:01:26;"That's lonely at the bottom of the deck."
02:01:26;02:01:31;"Plans go haywire in record time."
02:01:31;02:01:34;"The police abuse you, but you turn out fine."
02:01:34;02:01:41;"Surely someone must have told you."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""MOUNTAIN BREWS""]"
02:02:18;02:02:22;"Looking backwards at something strange,"
02:02:22;02:02:26;"your horoscope's telling you to keep the change."
02:02:26;02:02:36;"When I walk down your street, dreaming of, dreaming of,"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"dreaming of a change."
02:02:38;02:02:42;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
