01:39;01:39;"We're back."
01:39;01:42;"My name is Ezra Kainey."
01:42;01:46;"I'm a musician, primarily known for my work"
01:46;01:48;"with the group Vampire Weekend."
01:48;01:49;"And I'm here with my good buddy and co-host,"
01:49;01:50;"Jake Longstreth."
01:50;01:51;"What's up, Jake?"
01:51;01:52;"- Hey, man."
01:52;01:53;"How are you?"
01:53;01:54;"- Good, it's been a while."
01:54;01:56;"- Yeah, it's April."
01:56;01:58;"It's been a solid three months"
01:58;02:00;"since there was a new Time Crisis."
02:00;02:01;"- Yeah."
02:01;02:04;"- For people who are not familiar with Time Crisis,"
02:04;02:08;"you can go back and listen to the first 13 episodes."
02:08;02:11;"But basically it's a show where we play some music."
02:11;02:12;"- Talk music."
02:12;02:14;"- We talk music."
02:14;02:15;"But you know, we also talk about"
02:15;02:18;"what's happening in the world increasingly."
02:18;02:19;"- Yeah, big year this year."
02:19;02:22;"- Jake and I both have backgrounds in music."
02:22;02:24;"Jake is primarily a visual artist."
02:24;02:25;"- Yeah."
02:25;02:26;"- So I know we'll be bringing"
02:26;02:27;"that kind of artsy perspective."
02:27;02:28;"- Yeah."
02:28;02:29;"- Let's put a pin in that."
02:29;02:30;"Play some music."

04:27;04:30;"- Today, we're gonna be talking a lot about politics,"
04:30;04:32;"I think, or at least about the election,"
04:32;04:33;"because you know what?"
04:33;04:36;"We got the rest of the year to kind of talk about music,"
04:36;04:40;"but the primary is in full swing now."
04:40;04:40;"- Yeah."
04:40;04:43;"- A lot of emotions are happening."
04:43;04:44;"We gotta like find out how people feel."
04:44;04:47;"And I guess we gotta give people full disclosure"
04:47;04:51;"that you and I are both bros who support Bernie."
04:51;04:52;"Are we Bernie bros?"
04:52;04:53;"We'll find out later."
04:53;04:55;"We're gonna get into that."
04:55;04:57;"So of course, we're gonna be a little bit biased"
04:57;05:00;"towards Bernie, but I'd like to think"
05:00;05:02;"that we can do it in a respectful manner."
05:02;05:03;"- Absolutely."
05:03;05:06;"- That's been one of the major talking points"
05:06;05:07;"this campaign."
05:07;05:10;"Are Bernie supporters just a pack of animals?"
05:10;05:12;"I'd like to think that we're not."
05:12;05:13;"And you know, and beyond that,"
05:13;05:15;"we didn't just support Bernie."
05:15;05:18;"You and I were there on stage with him,"
05:18;05:21;"Iowa City, the primary kickoff,"
05:21;05:23;"singing ""This Land is Your Land."""
05:23;05:24;"- That was incredible."
05:24;05:25;"- That was fun."
05:25;05:26;"But you know what?"
05:26;05:27;"We gotta make sure that we see beyond the cult"
05:27;05:28;"of personality."
05:28;05:29;"It's very dangerous."
05:29;05:30;"- Yeah."
05:30;05:33;"And I think it's a criticism that people"
05:33;05:34;"lob at Bernie supporters."
05:34;05:35;"- Right, and it's possible,"
05:35;05:40;"because I understand why people are attracted"
05:40;05:43;"to that kind of charismatic politician."
05:43;05:44;"You and I were there."
05:44;05:45;"It's right before the Iowa primary."
05:45;05:48;"We're there in a big gym."
05:48;05:50;"We get to announce Bernie."
05:50;05:51;"The man comes out."
05:51;05:53;"Crowd goes wild."
05:53;05:54;"People are just chanting."
05:54;05:56;"They know his catchphrases."
05:56;05:57;"Everybody's psyched."
05:57;05:59;"Oh, Bernie also, when he came out,"
05:59;06:02;"he said, ""Thank you, Ezra and Vampire Weekend."
06:02;06:07;"I got to hear my first name from the lips of a great man."""
06:07;06:10;"Of course, it was exciting."
06:10;06:13;"- You believe he would be the best president"
06:13;06:18;"and that his policies would be best for the country, right?"
06:18;06:20;"- Yes, I believe that."
06:20;06:25;"- So what if someone without his gravitas"
06:25;06:27;"and charisma and authenticity"
06:27;06:30;"was putting forth those exact same policies?"
06:30;06:32;"- I'd like to think that I'd still be down."
06:32;06:33;"- Yeah."
06:33;06:33;"- So I want to talk about the origins"
06:33;06:36;"of the word charisma, Jake, if you don't mind."
06:36;06:40;"I'm on the Wikipedia for charisma."
06:40;06:44;"And the term charisma has two senses."
06:44;06:47;"One, compelling attractiveness or charm"
06:47;06:49;"that can inspire devotion in others."
06:49;06:51;"We're all familiar with that."
06:51;06:56;"Two, a divinely conferred power or talent."
06:56;06:58;"It comes from the Greek charisma,"
06:58;07:01;"which means gift of grace."
07:01;07:04;"There's almost like a supernatural element"
07:04;07:08;"that the gods gave you some special leg up."
07:08;07:10;"- Right, which obviously those two definitions"
07:10;07:12;"can be conflated."
07:12;07:14;"That's where belief comes in."
07:14;07:18;"If you're a politician or a rock star,"
07:18;07:20;"it's so charismatic that,"
07:20;07:22;"or they can be so charismatic"
07:22;07:23;"that you start to believe in them."
07:23;07:25;"- Right."
07:25;07:30;"They're saying one of the OG charismatic people"
07:30;07:32;"was Paul the Apostle."
07:32;07:38;"He was bestowed the gift of God's grace."
07:38;07:39;"- Oh, okay."
07:39;07:43;"- So when we find somebody charismatic,"
07:43;07:45;"it's not just that we think they're great."
07:45;07:47;"We almost believe there's something bigger than them."
07:47;07:48;"- Yeah."
07:48;07:49;"- And I think it holds true today."
07:49;07:50;"- Yeah, absolutely."
07:50;07:52;"- But what is that bigger thing?"
07:52;07:55;"- In Bernie's case or in general?"
07:55;07:56;"- I guess in any case."
07:56;07:59;"There's another phrase that I've always been fascinated by."
07:59;08:02;"Have we talked about this, burging?"
08:02;08:03;"- No."
08:03;08:06;"- B-I-R-G, it stands for basking in reflected glory."
08:06;08:08;"It kind of describes the phenomenon of like,"
08:08;08:12;"say, getting your ego tied up in like a sports team."
08:12;08:13;"Sports team won."
08:13;08:14;"- We won."
08:14;08:15;"- We won."
08:15;08:16;"- Yeah."
08:16;08:19;"- Sports team loses, maybe you do the opposite."
08:19;08:21;"Corfing, cutting off reflected failure."
08:21;08:24;"So this is like such a big part of it, burging."
08:24;08:27;"Are we burging in Bernie?"
08:27;08:28;"- Huh, who's we?"
08:28;08:31;"I mean, maybe the people that would be called"
08:31;08:32;"Bernie bros are."
08:32;08:34;"People that get, I mean."
08:34;08:35;"- I wanna keep coming back to this though."
08:35;08:36;"Are we Bernie bros?"
08:36;08:38;"- If it gets too emotional and you're investing"
08:38;08:41;"like this insane amount of your identity into it"
08:41;08:43;"and you're getting into like Facebook arguments with people."
08:43;08:44;"- Yeah."
08:44;08:45;"- Yeah, maybe you're burging."
08:45;08:49;"- I mean, I feel bad when I see Bernie lose."
08:49;08:51;"Does that make me a piece of shit?"
08:51;08:53;"- I feel like the classic thing that people will talk about"
08:53;08:55;"is that people only pay attention every four years"
08:55;08:56;"when it's like the big show."
08:56;08:58;"- Oh yeah, I'm guilty of that."
08:58;08:59;"- Yeah."
08:59;09:00;"- I guess I can say I'm a piece of shit"
09:00;09:01;"when it comes to that."
09:01;09:03;"How come I haven't been out there voting"
09:03;09:07;"for Green Party candidates in my local elections?"
09:07;09:08;"- Right."
09:08;09:09;"- How come you aren't or are you?"
09:09;09:10;"- No, I'm not."
09:10;09:12;"I had to actually look up."
09:12;09:12;"I was like, you know what?"
09:12;09:14;"Like during all this stuff the last few months,"
09:14;09:15;"I was like, you know what?"
09:15;09:18;"This is pathetic, but I don't even know"
09:18;09:21;"who the US representative is for where I live is."
09:21;09:23;"It's Xavier Becerra."
09:23;09:26;"- And you don't know him?"
09:26;09:28;"- No, I never heard his name before."
09:28;09:29;"- That's crazy how--"
09:29;09:30;"- And he's been in Congress for like 20 years."
09:30;09:32;"I don't even, I mean like it's funny too"
09:32;09:34;"'cause like I drive around, I listen to NPR."
09:34;09:35;"- Right."
09:35;09:36;"- I kind of tune in and out of like local news."
09:36;09:39;"I'm sort of like, how have I never heard that name?"
09:39;09:40;"- I'm glad that we're having this conversation"
09:40;09:43;"because there is definitely an element,"
09:43;09:45;"a piece of shit element to us."
09:45;09:48;"I wouldn't think it was fair for somebody else to say that,"
09:48;09:50;"but I think upon self-reflection,"
09:50;09:53;"we can identify that we're a kind of piece of shit."
09:53;09:56;"But that's a lot to chew on."
09:56;09:56;"- Let's do some tunes."
09:56;09:58;"- Let's do some tunes."
09:58;09:59;"- I think we need a feel good tune"
09:59;10:03;"because I think I wanna just pick feel good music today"
10:03;10:05;"because we're gonna be talking about"
10:05;10:09;"some really difficult country dividing issues today."
10:09;10:12;"So I wanted the music to in contrast be kind of feel good."
10:12;10:14;"How about a dead tune, Jake?"
10:14;10:16;"- Ooh, I like that."
10:16;10:17;"How about Ship of Fools?"

13:57;13:59;"- So Jake, one thing that we've talked about"
13:59;14:02;"is you and I both have a real interest"
14:02;14:04;"in health and fitness."
14:04;14:07;"And I think that should be a bigger part of ""Time Crisis."""
14:07;14:09;"Because the truth is, a lot of people listen to ""Time Crisis"""
14:09;14:14;"as normal people, not juice heads, not fitness freaks."
14:14;14:17;"And I think it's important for us"
14:17;14:18;"to have these conversations."
14:18;14:22;"So one of my latest obsessions has been counting my steps."
14:22;14:23;"- On your phone."
14:23;14:24;"- On my phone."
14:24;14:25;"Do you count your steps?"
14:25;14:26;"- Nope."
14:26;14:27;"I have an iPhone 4."
14:27;14:29;"- Oh, so it's not even possible?"
14:29;14:29;"- Nope."
14:29;14:30;"- So, oh, we can't even look?"
14:30;14:34;"- I'm still running a 2012 OS on it."
14:34;14:34;"- That's crazy."
14:34;14:35;"- Yeah."
14:35;14:37;"- So you can't even download apps or anything?"
14:37;14:38;"- No, not anymore."
14:38;14:40;"- How do you get your Seamless?"
14:40;14:41;"- What is that?"
14:41;14:43;"(laughs)"
14:43;14:46;"- Seamless is an app that lets you order food"
14:46;14:49;"from local restaurants without having to talk on the phone."
14:49;14:50;"- Oh."
14:50;14:54;"No, I call people on the phone and order food sometimes."
14:54;14:55;"- What about Uber?"
14:55;14:56;"- Don't have it."
14:56;14:57;"Can't have it."
14:57;14:58;"- Lyft?"
14:58;14:58;"- Don't have it."
14:58;15:00;"- The one for helicopters?"
15:00;15:01;"- Don't have it."
15:01;15:02;"I have Instagram."
15:02;15:03;"- How do you get around?"
15:03;15:06;"- Hannah, my girlfriend, has Uber."
15:06;15:07;"- What about when you're by yourself?"
15:07;15:09;"- It's actually been an issue a few times."
15:09;15:11;"And she's been like, ""You need to get a new phone."""
15:11;15:12;"- 'Cause you're, are you--"
15:12;15:14;"- I need a new Apple product phone."
15:14;15:16;"- Do you still call car services?"
15:16;15:17;"- I had to go to the airport recently"
15:17;15:19;"and I used a traditional shuttle"
15:19;15:21;"where I get picked up and there are other people."
15:21;15:23;"- How much does that cost?"
15:23;15:26;"- Ran me 35 from Highland Park to LAX."
15:26;15:28;"- That doesn't even sound like such a good deal."
15:28;15:29;"35?"
15:29;15:30;"- Well, well."
15:30;15:32;"- What would an UberX have been?"
15:32;15:33;"50?"
15:33;15:34;"- Wait, is X the shared one?"
15:34;15:35;"- No."
15:35;15:36;"Oh my God."
15:36;15:37;"- No."
15:37;15:38;"- Well, you know, this is also--"
15:38;15:39;"- Okay, Uber--"
15:39;15:39;"- This is educational for the listeners."
15:39;15:41;"- Uber would have been like 60, dude."
15:41;15:41;"I've done it."
15:41;15:44;"UberX is the cheapest solo Uber."
15:44;15:45;"- Okay."
15:45;15:47;"- And I just wanna say, that's what I use all the time."
15:47;15:49;"I'm just a normal guy."
15:49;15:49;"I use UberX."
15:49;15:51;"- You're repping for it."
15:51;15:53;"- Unless I'm going maybe to a black tie event."
15:53;15:54;"- Then what do you do?"
15:54;15:55;"The SUV?"
15:55;15:57;"- I might get Uber black."
15:57;15:58;"- Is that a thing?"
15:58;15:59;"- Yeah."
15:59;16:02;"- I didn't know there were so many brand distinctions."
16:02;16:03;"- Oh yeah, because they have it"
16:03;16:06;"for all different price points."
16:06;16:06;"The one thing I will say--"
16:06;16:07;"- Well, this is fascinating."
16:07;16:08;"- The one thing that I will say that I don't like"
16:08;16:10;"about Uber is the surge pricing."
16:10;16:11;"- That seems harsh."
16:11;16:12;"Are you familiar with it?"
16:12;16:14;"- Yeah, I'm familiar with it as a concept."
16:14;16:16;"It seems just brutal."
16:16;16:18;"- It seems un-American to me"
16:18;16:24;"that a company can essentially create a monopoly"
16:24;16:30;"and then use that to manipulate the price."
16:30;16:31;"- Well--"
16:31;16:32;"- Or am I tripping?"
16:32;16:32;"- You're tripping because listen to this."
16:32;16:33;"- Why?"
16:33;16:35;"- Okay, taxi cabs we know are terrible"
16:35;16:37;"and they're really expensive and they're regulated"
16:37;16:40;"and then Uber is sort of like the neoliberal"
16:40;16:41;"free market answer to that."
16:41;16:42;"- Right."
16:42;16:43;"- In which it's completely unregulated."
16:43;16:44;"- Yeah."
16:44;16:46;"- And so you get the benefits of that"
16:46;16:48;"which are cheaper prices when it's chill."
16:48;16:49;"- Right."
16:49;16:51;"- And then when demand is high, you're gonna pay more."
16:51;16:51;"- All right, counter--"
16:51;16:52;"- That's the flip side."
16:52;16:55;"- Well, counterpoint, post-World War II, Vienna."
16:55;16:56;"- Here we go."
16:56;16:57;"- Let's take it back."
16:57;17:02;"A city destroyed by man's inhumanity to his fellow man."
17:02;17:05;"You had a lot of people jacking up prices"
17:05;17:09;"in the black market for basic goods."
17:09;17:10;"- Yeah."
17:10;17:14;"- And that was very illegal because our society says"
17:14;17:18;"that to jack up prices for a can of beans"
17:18;17:20;"when people are living--"
17:20;17:21;"- Hand to mouth."
17:21;17:25;"- In poverty, hand to mouth is deeply immoral."
17:25;17:26;"- That's a fair argument."
17:26;17:28;"I'm just saying like the flip side of that is"
17:28;17:29;"then you're gonna pay more--"
17:29;17:30;"- On average."
17:30;17:33;"- On average for a taxi cab that's regulated."
17:33;17:35;"- Is Uber unsocialist?"
17:35;17:37;"- Yeah, Uber is like the most straight up"
17:37;17:39;"capitalist thing ever."
17:39;17:41;"Like all their employees are freelancers."
17:41;17:42;"- Yeah."
17:42;17:44;"- You know, there's no like health benefits."
17:44;17:45;"It's all just sort of--"
17:45;17:46;"- Oh, this is a disaster."
17:46;17:47;"- It's all, I mean people hate--"
17:47;17:48;"- Okay, now we're taking full circle."
17:48;17:50;"- People hate on Uber."
17:50;17:52;"- We gotta get Bernie in office, man."
17:52;17:54;"- All right, now--"
17:54;17:57;"- Hillary wants to regulate Uber and Airbnb."
17:57;17:58;"- Oh, really?"
17:58;17:59;"- Mm-hmm."
17:59;18:00;"I don't know what Bernie's stance is,"
18:00;18:01;"but I remember hearing that"
18:01;18:02;"and I think that was interesting."
18:02;18:06;"- Sidebar, I would love to find out"
18:06;18:08;"who owns a piece of Uber."
18:08;18:09;"- Yeah."
18:09;18:11;"- If we get a list, we might find out that like--"
18:11;18:13;"- Bruce Willis went in on Uber."
18:13;18:15;"- Bruce Willis might own a big piece of Uber,"
18:15;18:19;"like Jay-Z, in fact, I bet you,"
18:19;18:20;"Jay-Z probably has part of Uber."
18:20;18:23;"I would just love to see that."
18:23;18:25;"I would love to know when I'm using an app"
18:25;18:27;"whose pockets I'm lining."
18:27;18:30;"If it's Bruce Willis and Jay-Z, I'm done."
18:30;18:31;"- Yeah."

23:43;23:55;"- Welcome back to Time Crisis,"
23:55;23:59;"a show about music and the world around us."
23:59;24:01;"I'm Ezra Koenig, I'm here with my good buddy,"
24:01;24:02;"Jake Longstreth."
24:02;24:03;"- Hey man."
24:03;24:05;"- And we were just joined in the studio"
24:05;24:07;"by comedian Shelby Farrell."
24:07;24:08;"What's up Shelby?"
24:08;24:10;"- Nothing, I think I just made a gross sound"
24:10;24:11;"with my water bottle."
24:11;24:13;"- That's fine, it's absolutely fine."
24:13;24:14;"We're keeping it real on Time Crisis"
24:14;24:16;"'cause this is a Time Crisis town hall."
24:16;24:19;"We're discussing the issues that affect people."
24:19;24:20;"- You guys are all Bernie supporters."
24:20;24:21;"- On the show?"
24:21;24:22;"- Yeah."
24:22;24:24;"- Jake and I are both Bernie supporters."
24:24;24:26;"We performed for him, for his campaign."
24:26;24:27;"- You guys both did?"
24:27;24:28;"- Yeah, Jake was on stage with a vampire"
24:28;24:29;"looking dirty projectors, but yes."
24:29;24:31;"- You want, but--"
24:31;24:32;"- Yes, okay."
24:32;24:33;"You got something on your mind."
24:33;24:35;"- That really is crazy to me."
24:35;24:36;"You guys want Bernie Sanders in the White House."
24:36;24:38;"You want him in the Oval Office."
24:38;24:41;"In 2016, you want Bernie Sanders sworn in"
24:41;24:42;"sitting behind that desk."
24:42;24:43;"- Is it really so strange?"
24:43;24:44;"- Yes."
24:44;24:45;"- Yes it is, yeah."
24:45;24:47;"- So you're more than just critical of Bernie Sanders."
24:47;24:49;"It boggles your mind that we support him."
24:49;24:50;"Wait, are you--"
24:50;24:51;"- I don't know, am I wrong?"
24:51;24:52;"- Well, no, no, no, you tell me."
24:52;24:54;"'Cause we're trying to be self-reflective on this show"
24:54;24:55;"and we're really glad to have,"
24:55;24:59;"to not just have like a whole Bernie love fest in here."
24:59;25:02;"So why is it so hard for you to believe that we like Bernie?"
25:02;25:05;"Is it because you thought Jake and I were smart gentlemen"
25:05;25:07;"and that's just such a dumbass move?"
25:07;25:09;"Or what is it?"
25:09;25:10;"- No, I--"
25:10;25:11;"- Do you think we're pieces?"
25:11;25:12;"- No, of course not."
25:12;25:13;"- Hey, you can say it, you can say it."
25:13;25:14;"- I mean, to be honest, the worst thing is,"
25:14;25:17;"is that you would have to be a piece of,"
25:17;25:22;"to not support him at face value."
25:22;25:25;"To not agree with the things that he says."
25:25;25:30;"You wouldn't have to be like a malicious person."
25:30;25:33;"But what about the stuff he actually wants to do?"
25:33;25:36;"I don't know, I don't know."
25:36;25:36;"It is a little crazy to me."
25:36;25:37;"- Okay, okay, okay."
25:37;25:38;"- What has he done?"
25:38;25:41;"- Well, Bernie has not said anything,"
25:41;25:43;"has not proposed anything that he wants to get done"
25:43;25:45;"that I personally find crazy."
25:45;25:47;"- Did you read that tax plan article?"
25:47;25:48;"- Yeah, so Shelby sent me an article"
25:48;25:50;"about Bernie's tax plan earlier."
25:50;25:52;"It was written by a guy who works in finance"
25:52;25:54;"and he says he really loves Bernie as a person."
25:54;25:55;"- And he seems pretty legit."
25:55;25:57;"I'm always wary of econ articles,"
25:57;25:59;"but he seems the most legit of the one."
25:59;26:01;"But like multiple economists have come out"
26:01;26:03;"and been like, ""This plan is bonkers."""
26:03;26:05;"- So this is a guy who works in finance"
26:05;26:08;"who says he knows a lot about economics."
26:08;26:10;"And he says, ""I love Bernie."
26:10;26:11;"""I root for him."
26:11;26:13;"""I share his values more than any other candidate."
26:13;26:16;"""And yet I think his tax plan is crazy."""
26:16;26:18;"And he specifically says, ""It's really messed up."
26:18;26:21;"""He's gonna raise everybody's taxes by 2.2%."""
26:21;26:22;"He doesn't think that--"
26:22;26:24;"- It's bad for independent contractors,"
26:24;26:26;"every salary tax or whatever it's called."
26:26;26:27;"This is the problem."
26:27;26:28;"I don't know what the (beep) I'm talking about."
26:28;26:28;"I'm like the worst person to talk about this."
26:28;26:30;"- Small business owners?"
26:30;26:31;"- No, not small business owner, independent."
26:31;26:32;"Like I'm a freelancer."
26:32;26:35;"I am technically a freelancer in the work that I do."
26:35;26:37;"And I would get taxed on every paycheck."
26:37;26:39;"A fifth of my paycheck will be gone every time I get it."
26:39;26:40;"And I can't--"
26:40;26:41;"- An extra 20%?"
26:41;26:42;"- And I can't live like that."
26:42;26:43;"- No, no, no, no."
26:43;26:45;"- No, the total tax just on my paycheck"
26:45;26:47;"before I pay taxes is a fifth gone."
26:47;26:50;"Like before I pay my federal and state income tax."
26:50;26:51;"There's an extra tax on it."
26:51;26:52;"- Self-employment tax."
26:52;26:53;"- Okay, all right."
26:53;26:54;"So I like what you're saying though."
26:54;26:56;"'Cause you're saying this is a substantive critique"
26:56;26:57;"of Bernie."
26:57;27:01;"You feel that Bernie is going to negatively affect--"
27:01;27:02;"- And that is also true, I guess,"
27:02;27:03;"for small business owners too."
27:03;27:06;"If you're like a dentist and own your own practice,"
27:06;27:07;"which is the example the guy used,"
27:07;27:08;"you'd be taxed like crazy."
27:08;27:10;"- I have no sympathy for dentists."

31:16;31:17;"- How old are you?"
31:17;31:18;"- I'm 22."
31:18;31:19;"- You're 22."
31:19;31:22;"A young person in an expensive city, Los Angeles."
31:22;31:25;"- Last year, with being super, super lucky"
31:25;31:28;"and having health insurance, thanks to my parents"
31:28;31:31;"and their work and being young enough to be on it."
31:31;31:31;"- Right."
31:31;31:34;"- Needing a lot of medical stuff done,"
31:34;31:36;"which I was lucky and they helped me with."
31:36;31:37;"- Yeah."
31:37;31:40;"- I made $30,000 or $34,000"
31:40;31:42;"and I paid for, and everything else I paid for myself."
31:42;31:44;"If I had made any less, I would have been homeless."
31:44;31:47;"Like I would not have been able to live."
31:47;31:50;"- Right, and $34,000 by any standard--"
31:50;31:51;"- It's one of those things where it's like,"
31:51;31:52;"it's a lot, but it's not a lot."
31:52;31:53;"You know what I mean?"
31:53;31:54;"- No, no, no, no, no."
31:54;31:55;"That's not a lot of money to live on"
31:55;31:56;"in one of the most expensive cities in America."
31:56;31:58;"And for your work, you kind of have to live in LA."
31:58;31:59;"- Yeah."
31:59;32:00;"- You said you felt like you barely made it"
32:00;32:01;"through last year."
32:01;32:02;"- Yeah, and I mean, that's also hard to say"
32:02;32:03;"when it's like--"
32:03;32:04;"- Right, right."
32:04;32:05;"- You're driving home in a car."
32:05;32:06;"- No, but I get it."
32:06;32:08;"I think that's a very reasonable reason"
32:08;32:09;"to not want to support somebody."
32:09;32:12;"You feel like you barely made it through last year."
32:12;32:14;"And based on what you've read about his tax plan,"
32:14;32:16;"you'd be making less."
32:16;32:18;"That could be like the difference between"
32:18;32:20;"like living in LA or not being able to."
32:20;32:22;"- That is what really got me."
32:22;32:26;"And the thing about wanting to tax sizable gifts to people,"
32:26;32:28;"which is one of those things that sounds--"
32:28;32:29;"- Oh, I'm into that."
32:29;32:30;"- That's what I'm saying."
32:30;32:31;"- Like inheritance, we're talking."
32:31;32:33;"- Inheritance, but also no, just gifts."
32:33;32:35;"Like if my parents wanted to pay"
32:35;32:37;"for my little brother's college, which they will,"
32:37;32:38;"they will help him."
32:38;32:39;"He will have, I don't want to, you know,"
32:39;32:41;"put my parents' financial situation on blast,"
32:41;32:43;"but I'm pretty sure that there will be--"
32:43;32:45;"- They're the type of people who can pay"
32:45;32:46;"for their child's college."
32:46;32:47;"- No."
32:47;32:47;"- Oh, no, no."
32:47;32:49;"- They're the type of people who can maybe pay"
32:49;32:51;"for at least some of it to most of it"
32:51;32:53;"if they want to get a third more, you know,"
32:53;32:56;"they'll do what they have to do to do it."
32:56;32:58;"But, and my brother might still have to take out a loan,"
32:58;33:01;"but if they pay for even a third of what college costs"
33:01;33:04;"right now for him, they'll get taxed on that amount of money."
33:04;33:08;"It's any gift over like $14,000, which is like a house,"
33:08;33:08;"it's a wedding."
33:08;33:10;"- Even when you buy somebody something?"
33:10;33:11;"- Yeah, it doesn't matter, it's a gift."
33:11;33:12;"- So if you buy your kid--"
33:12;33:13;"- It's called a gift."
33:13;33:15;"- You buy your kid college, that's a gift?"
33:15;33:16;"- Yes."
33:16;33:17;"- They're writing a check to the college."
33:17;33:19;"- For in your child's name."
33:19;33:20;"- Huh."
33:20;33:21;"- 'Cause it's going for your kid."
33:21;33:22;"And in theory--"
33:22;33:23;"- I don't know, I didn't read the article."
33:23;33:24;"- And in theory, it's one of the--"
33:24;33:25;"- I wanna read the article now."
33:25;33:27;"- And I don't know, maybe I'm wrong,"
33:27;33:29;"but like in theory, it's one of those things of like,"
33:29;33:31;"yeah, just 'cause your parents can afford college,"
33:31;33:34;"like what about the kid whose parents can't afford college?"
33:34;33:37;"And it's like, well, but that, yeah, that sounds good,"
33:37;33:38;"but the whole point is that, yeah,"
33:38;33:39;"then you have government aid"
33:39;33:41;"and you have student loans for that person,"
33:41;33:43;"and then the money can go to them"
33:43;33:45;"so that like you should be trying to,"
33:45;33:46;"the people who can pay for stuff"
33:46;33:47;"should be paying for stuff."
33:47;33:48;"Like--"
33:48;33:49;"- Yeah, I don't think--"
33:49;33:50;"- Like that's a crazy thing."
33:50;33:51;"Did your parents pay for your college?"
33:51;33:53;"They paid for some of mine."
33:53;33:54;"- My parents paid for some of it."
33:54;33:56;"I had some loans from the government,"
33:56;33:57;"I had some scholarships."
33:57;33:58;"I still, I graduated in debt,"
33:58;34:02;"but I guess if my parents had been taxed"
34:02;34:03;"on what they contributed,"
34:03;34:05;"I would have graduated in even greater debt."
34:05;34:06;"- Yeah."
34:06;34:08;"- And I was not, I did not enjoy being in debt."
34:08;34:09;"- I mean, it's just stuff like that,"
34:09;34:10;"but at the same time, like what are the odds"
34:10;34:12;"that that's actually gonna get passed?"
34:12;34:13;"But what are the odds that he's gonna spend four years"
34:13;34:16;"trying to get this stuff passed"
34:16;34:17;"and then nothing else will happen?"
34:17;34:18;"You know what I mean?"
34:18;34:19;"Like--"
34:19;34:20;"- I don't know about that, Bernie."
34:20;34:22;"I think you should let the parents pay the tuition."
34:22;34:23;"- Exactly."
34:23;34:25;"- I would love to confirm if that's actually real."
34:25;34:26;"- I mean, you have a phone."
34:26;34:27;"I mean, but that's what I'm saying."
34:27;34:28;"Like we all have the exact same--"
34:28;34:29;"- Jake has an iPhone 4."
34:29;34:30;"- We have, I mean, you're right."
34:30;34:32;"You might be at a disadvantage here,"
34:32;34:34;"but I mean, we all have the exact same resources."
34:34;34:35;"So it's true."
34:35;34:36;"I'm coming into the conversation"
34:36;34:38;"with just as much knowledge as you guys can find,"
34:38;34:41;"who knows the future while trying to make educated guesses."
34:41;34:42;"- You're right."
34:42;34:43;"Well, Shelby, I really appreciate"
34:43;34:45;"that you've been getting to the heart of the matter."

36:29;36:32;"Let's hear from writer and editor, Aisha Siddiqui."
36:32;36:34;"(phone ringing)"
36:34;36:35;"- Hello?"
36:35;36:36;"- Hey, what's up, Aisha?"
36:36;36:37;"- Hi, Ezra."
36:37;36:38;"- How are you?"
36:38;36:39;"- I'm great, how are you?"
36:39;36:39;"- We're amazing."
36:39;36:43;"We're talking real politics out here in Los Angeles."
36:43;36:45;"First, can you tell me where are you"
36:45;36:46;"and what are you doing right now?"
36:46;36:47;"- I'm in New York City."
36:47;36:52;"I just got home and I'm in the Time Crisis Town Hall,"
36:52;36:54;"the New York chapter."
36:54;36:55;"Not very crowded here yet."
36:55;36:57;"It's just me, but great snacks."
36:57;36:59;"- We gotta get those numbers up."
36:59;37:01;"So, one question I have for you."
37:01;37:02;"Are you gonna vote?"
37:02;37:05;"- Yeah, you know, this is the first time"
37:05;37:06;"I'm qualified to vote,"
37:06;37:08;"so I think I'll have to take advantage of that."
37:08;37:11;"- Because you just got your citizenship, correct?"
37:11;37:12;"- I did, last summer."
37:12;37:15;"- You've been living in America mad long."
37:15;37:16;"How long?"
37:16;37:17;"- Mm-hmm."
37:17;37:20;"About 19 years."
37:20;37:21;"- About 19 years, but this is the first time"
37:21;37:22;"you can officially vote."
37:22;37:23;"So you are gonna vote?"
37:23;37:25;"- Yes."
37:25;37:28;"I mean, between now and then, anything could happen."
37:28;37:29;"November's a long time away,"
37:29;37:33;"but barring any unforeseen accidents, I think so, yeah."
37:33;37:35;"- Based on the current field,"
37:35;37:38;"who are you gonna vote for?"
37:38;37:39;"- I hope to have the chance to be able to vote"
37:39;37:41;"for Bernie Sanders."
37:41;37:44;"I think he's the only one who has a chance of beating Trump,"
37:44;37:46;"and I can't really imagine myself casting a vote"
37:46;37:49;"for Hillary Clinton."
37:49;37:51;"- You got some sympathetic ears over here,"
37:51;37:55;"'cause the Time Crisis crew is very Team Bernie."
37:55;37:57;"Well, thank you very much, Aisha."
37:57;37:58;"- You're very welcome."

38:57;39:01;"- And we're back at the Time Crisis Town Hall."
39:01;39:04;"Jake Shelby and I are joined by Jake's buddy."
39:04;39:06;"You wanna introduce him, Jake?"
39:06;39:08;"- I'm simply Jake's buddy."
39:08;39:10;"- Well, that's my introduction of Jake's introduction."
39:10;39:15;"Eric Yonker is a visual artist living in Los Angeles."
39:15;39:17;"He's also 39 like I am."
39:17;39:19;"- So we're very happy to have you, Eric."
39:19;39:20;"First of all, I wanna say,"
39:20;39:23;"look at this amazing cross section of America"
39:23;39:24;"that we got here."
39:24;39:26;"We got two visual artists,"
39:26;39:28;"got a musician,"
39:28;39:29;"and we got a comedian."
39:29;39:31;"- Whoa, that is a great cross section."
39:31;39:33;"Yeah, we're all the same spectrum,"
39:33;39:36;"the same shade on the color scale."
39:36;39:39;"- Yeah, I guess, yeah, we're all Caucasian."
39:39;39:41;"- Yeah, of course, you guys got a full mane."
39:41;39:42;"I'm the only bald one on the group."
39:42;39:43;"- Oh, are you bald?"
39:43;39:44;"- I'm wearing my best head of hair with this beanie."
39:44;39:45;"- You're wearing a head."
39:45;39:46;"- You got a big beard, though."
39:46;39:48;"- That's how I have to make up for it, man."
39:48;39:51;"- So we have a real cross section of America,"
39:51;39:56;"four Caucasians, but representing three types of art."
39:56;39:58;"- Oh, is that right?"
39:58;39:59;"Yeah, okay."
39:59;40:00;"- Visual, comedic, and musical."
40:00;40:01;"- Got it."
40:01;40:04;"- But we wanted to have you on because this is a town hall."
40:04;40:08;"And look, Jake and I are just two crunchy old hippies"
40:08;40:11;"over here, we're hardcore burn dogs."
40:11;40:14;"We were literally out there singing folk songs"
40:14;40:15;"with the man."
40:15;40:18;"So yeah, we're kind of mobbed up with Bernie,"
40:18;40:21;"but we wanted to make sure that we have something balanced."
40:21;40:25;"So Shelby, thank you for letting it be two Bernie bros"
40:25;40:26;"talking to one Hillary supporter,"
40:26;40:27;"but you are also a Hillary supporter."
40:27;40:28;"- Absolutely."
40:28;40:30;"- So now we're more balanced."
40:30;40:31;"- What's wrong with me, though,"
40:31;40:33;"that I don't like being called a supporter?"
40:33;40:34;"Of either one."
40:34;40:37;"- You know what, that makes you sound like a bra."
40:37;40:38;"- That's a very good point."
40:38;40:41;"I mean, like, yeah, do I love being called"
40:41;40:43;"like a Bernie supporter?"
40:43;40:44;"I'm supporting him in this election."
40:44;40:46;"- Okay, you played at one of his rallies, so I hope so."
40:46;40:48;"- Well, yeah, but like, what does it mean a supporter?"
40:48;40:50;"Does that mean like ride or die?"
40:50;40:52;"- Yeah."
40:52;40:53;"- Enthusiast."
40:53;40:54;"- I'm not ride or die for Bernie."
40:54;40:56;"Like, what if it found out that Bernie"
40:56;40:57;"did something despicable?"
40:57;40:58;"- Whoa."
40:58;41:00;"You mean you actually think that's possible?"
41:00;41:02;"You actually think maybe in the general election,"
41:02;41:03;"should he win the nomination,"
41:03;41:05;"that there might be something out there,"
41:05;41:07;"some skeleton in the closet"
41:07;41:09;"that might blow up the whole thing?"
41:09;41:10;"- You think there could be 56 women?"
41:10;41:12;"- I think that's highly unlikely."
41:12;41:13;"- I know a lot."
41:13;41:14;"No, I'm just kidding."
41:14;41:14;"- I think it's highly--"
41:14;41:15;"- That's actually not highly unlikely."
41:15;41:17;"It happens every general."
41:17;41:19;"- First of all, have you guys ever heard"
41:19;41:22;"one of these stories that somebody finds out"
41:22;41:26;"that mom or dad or grandma or grandpa has another family?"
41:26;41:27;"- Yeah."
41:27;41:28;"- Sure."
41:28;41:30;"- Absolutely, that did happen to me, actually."
41:30;41:30;"- That happened to you?"
41:30;41:31;"- Oh, yeah."
41:31;41:32;"- In your family?"
41:32;41:33;"- Within my family."
41:33;41:34;"- Oh, wait, oh, no."
41:34;41:35;"- And it was me."
41:35;41:35;"- Oh, okay, all right."
41:35;41:38;"- No, no, no, absolutely true."
41:38;41:39;"It happened to me."
41:39;41:39;"- These things happen."
41:39;41:42;"People find out horrible, awful things."
41:42;41:44;"This really sounds like I'm throwing Bernie under the bus,"
41:44;41:49;"but all I'm saying is that you have to be really optimistic"
41:49;41:51;"to not believe that you can ever get blindsided"
41:51;41:54;"by something wild and surprising."
41:54;41:55;"- And that is politics."
41:55;41:57;"- And so I agree."
41:57;41:59;"If part of the debate is saying,"
41:59;42:02;"oh, Bernie wouldn't do that, Hillary would do that."
42:02;42:04;"I mean, look, we can look at people's records"
42:04;42:06;"and guess what they may or may not do,"
42:06;42:08;"but once you start getting into personal stuff,"
42:08;42:10;"I don't know, man."
42:10;42:12;"I'm not gonna sit here and say Bernie isn't capable"
42:12;42:14;"of doing something despicable."
42:14;42:14;"I don't think he would."
42:14;42:17;"I also don't think my dad would do something despicable."
42:17;42:18;"I don't think my grandfather, rest in peace,"
42:18;42:20;"would have done something despicable,"
42:20;42:23;"but again, I'd like to think that if I found out they did,"
42:23;42:26;"we'd talk it out and I wouldn't vote for them for president."
42:26;42:28;"I would still hold them dear to my heart"
42:28;42:29;"and I would hope that they get help"
42:29;42:30;"for the despicable thing that they did."
42:30;42:33;"- But I do also like to think that my dad"
42:33;42:35;"would eat a person if he had to."
42:35;42:36;"Do you know what I mean?"
42:36;42:37;"- What do you mean?"
42:37;42:38;"- Which could be despicable."
42:38;42:39;"No, I don't mean murder."
42:39;42:41;"I mean like Donner Party, you know,"
42:41;42:43;"you do the horrible things you have to do sometimes."
42:43;42:44;"- I think Bernie was around for that, actually."
42:44;42:45;"He's a survivor."
42:45;42:46;"- He was there."
42:46;42:47;"- Ages."
42:47;42:48;"- You're damn right."
42:48;42:52;"- So Eric, is that part of your criticism or--"
42:52;42:53;"- No, absolutely not."
42:53;42:54;"Actually, no."
42:54;42:56;"Age has nothing to do with it."
42:56;42:58;"In fact, I think a lot of people,"
42:58;43:00;"since we're playing this game on this level,"
43:00;43:04;"it seems fair to say that I had an amazing Jewish grandfather"
43:04;43:08;"from Brooklyn and so I think that the rest of America"
43:08;43:10;"wants to share in what I already had."
43:10;43:13;"- But you know it's not all that it's cracked up to be."
43:13;43:15;"- You know, no, it's fantastic,"
43:15;43:18;"but at the same time, I don't think,"
43:18;43:21;"I mean, he made a hell of a real estate agent"
43:21;43:25;"and a car wash owner, but beyond that, no, president, no."
43:25;43:26;"- You know what, man?"
43:26;43:27;"I'm gonna stop you right there."
43:27;43:29;"Sounds like your grandpa was a capitalist."

47:20;47:22;"Well, so I just want to say something about Eric."
47:22;47:25;"I'm already getting a great vibe off you as a human being."
47:25;47:28;"I'm not a person, and any friend of Jake's a friend of mine."
47:28;47:29;"But I want to--"
47:30;47:31;"--Ezra just vomited on himself."
47:31;47:32;"One thing that's interesting--"
47:32;47:33;"Yeah."
47:33;47:36;"--is that probably a lot of people would take you for a Bernie bro,"
47:36;47:39;"because you're a guy who works-- who's a painter,"
47:39;47:42;"who has a vintage sweater, big beard,"
47:42;47:44;"Jewish grandfather from Brooklyn."
47:44;47:46;"You're a sleeper cell Ben Stern."
47:46;47:47;"No, I'm not."
47:47;47:49;"But you're not a Bernie bro, and so I'm curious."
47:49;47:51;"I guess, are people-- and this is what's messed up."
47:51;47:55;"Imagine Shelby being a 22-year-old Caucasian woman."
47:55;47:57;"People, when you say you support Hillary,"
47:57;47:59;"people say, oh, well, yeah, you're a Caucasian woman."
47:59;48:00;"It's not a surprise."
48:00;48:02;"And then they probably look at Eric and say, oh,"
48:02;48:05;"but you're like a hipster with a beard."
48:05;48:06;"You must love Bernie."
48:06;48:07;"Right."
48:07;48:08;"And maybe neither one of those things are fair."
48:08;48:09;"It is fair."
48:10;48:15;"I completely aim for stereotyping."
48:15;48:16;"I mean, here's the thing."
48:16;48:20;"I am and have been this guy before anybody knew"
48:20;48:22;"Bernie existed other than people in Vermont."
48:22;48:23;"Right."
48:23;48:24;"Quite essentially."
48:24;48:27;"Okay, so I've also been and had the great pleasure"
48:27;48:30;"of my first presidential election that I got to vote in."
48:30;48:33;"I got to vote for Bill Clinton, and I've been a Clinton fan"
48:33;48:35;"and supporter ever since that time."
48:35;48:38;"I also have come to-- I mean, you could consider"
48:38;48:40;"my art is politics."
48:40;48:44;"I am a satirist, but I am a political cartoonist,"
48:44;48:46;"glorified, essentially."
48:46;48:49;"I have eaten the meat and potatoes of politics"
48:49;48:53;"since that light was-- especially since that lightbulb"
48:53;48:56;"was turned on when George W. Bush got elected once"
48:56;48:57;"and twice."
48:57;48:58;"You had to decide--"
48:58;48:59;"You didn't like him."
48:59;49:01;"No, I didn't like him, but sure, I would have loved"
49:01;49:04;"to have a beer with him just like I would Bernie."
49:04;49:07;"When did we start liking our politicians?"
49:07;49:08;"I don't want to like my president."
49:08;49:09;"Amen, sister."
49:09;49:10;"I don't need to."
49:10;49:11;"That's what I'm talking about."
49:11;49:12;"I don't know."
49:12;49:13;"I want him to be boring."
49:13;49:16;"I want my president."
49:16;49:17;"No, you're right."
49:17;49:20;"I mean, beer worthiness should not be a qualification"
49:20;49:22;"for president, and it's amazing how much--"
49:22;49:24;"what is America's obsession with beer?"
49:24;49:27;"I've always been more into hard liquor, tequila."
49:27;49:29;"What is this insane American obsession with--"
49:29;49:30;"everybody's talking about beer."
49:30;49:32;"He seems like somebody you'd like to have a beer with."
49:32;49:34;"I even saw somebody talking about, you know what?"
49:34;49:36;"I bet Hillary would want to have a beer with me."
49:36;49:37;"Who cares?"
49:37;49:38;"Also, I'm just curious."
49:38;49:41;"Who would not want to have a white wine with Hillary Clinton"
49:41;49:43;"and hear her [bleep] about Bill?"
49:43;49:44;"Who wouldn't want that?"
49:44;49:47;"Think about every fun, drunk, older woman in your life"
49:47;49:49;"and tell me you wouldn't want that."
49:49;49:51;"So Shelby, white wine with Hillary."
49:51;49:53;"Wait, if I'm going to choose anything,"
49:53;49:55;"I want to do shrooms with Kennedy."
49:55;49:57;"Okay, Shelby, shrooms with Kennedy."
49:57;50:00;"I would like to do a [bleep] with pre-sobriety George Bush"
50:00;50:03;"because I'm not trying to put the evil of cocaine"
50:03;50:06;"back into his life, and I need to be very clear about that."
50:06;50:07;"Jake, how about you?"
50:07;50:09;"What president?"
50:09;50:11;"Maybe a 12er with Obama."
50:11;50:13;"12er? Wait, because you used to drink six?"
50:13;50:15;"Yeah, we used to drink six."
50:15;50:18;"We'd drink a 12er over a three-hour period."
50:18;50:20;"All right, I'm into it."
50:20;50:21;"That's a good call."
50:21;50:22;"And Eric?"
50:22;50:24;"I'll take some absinthe with Lincoln, man."
50:24;50:26;"That'd be my deal. That'd be my jam."
50:26;50:27;"Okay, real throwback."
50:27;50:29;"No doubt."
50:29;50:30;"He's got that high voice, though."
50:30;50:32;"You don't want-- I don't know if you want that."
50:32;50:34;"That's Daniel Day-Lewis's impression."
50:34;50:35;"Double-dig large."
50:35;50:38;"Is there any chance that Lincoln had absinthe?"
50:38;50:40;"Oh, for sure, or some moonshine."
50:40;50:42;"Yeah, that's totally mid-19th century."

54:10;54:11;"- Hey."
54:11;54:12;"- I'm meeting you for the first time."
54:12;54:13;"- Yeah."
54:13;54:14;"- We go back."
54:14;54:17;"At some point, I remember following you on Twitter."
54:17;54:18;"- Yes."
54:18;54:21;"- And at some point, I PayPaled you $57."
54:21;54:22;"- $57."
54:22;54:23;"- Wait, why was it again?"
54:23;54:24;"- That was--"
54:24;54:25;"- Are you kidding?"
54:25;54:26;"'Cause you thought I said something derogatory about you?"
54:26;54:28;"- Oh, no, because Jake Fogelness"
54:28;54:30;"said something derogatory about me."
54:30;54:31;"'Cause I just did--"
54:31;54:32;"- Oh, and I faved it."
54:32;54:36;"- I did a pilot where it was a talk show from my bedroom."
54:36;54:37;"He used to do a talk show from his bedroom."
54:37;54:38;"- Oh, yeah, I remember it, yeah."
54:38;54:41;"- And so he did this photo where it was me"
54:41;54:44;"and then the upgrade picture, the upgrade me."
54:44;54:45;"- Oh, and it was him."
54:45;54:46;"- And then a picture of him at my age."
54:46;54:48;"- And for people not familiar with this meme,"
54:48;54:49;"he was kind of implying that"
54:49;54:51;"you are somehow less or worse than him."
54:51;54:52;"- Right."
54:52;54:53;"- And that he is better than you."
54:53;54:54;"- Exactly."
54:54;54:58;"And then you co-signed it via smashing that like button."
54:58;54:59;"- Yeah."
54:59;55:01;"- It was a fave back then, I think."
55:01;55:02;"- No, it was a like."
55:02;55:03;"- It was a like."
55:03;55:04;"- This is in the like area."
55:04;55:06;"- I smashed the like because I respect people"
55:06;55:08;"making funny tweets, that's it."
55:08;55:09;"- Right."
55:09;55:11;"- But I did feel bad because at the end of the day,"
55:11;55:14;"Jake's been working in the media 'cause I remember"
55:14;55:16;"I used to hear him on the radio in New York."
55:16;55:17;"I remember when he was on MTV."
55:17;55:22;"This guy's been in the media for maybe 20, 30 years."
55:22;55:23;"- Right."
55:23;55:24;"- And meanwhile, you are a young cat."
55:24;55:27;"Everybody talks about you as a millennial comedian."
55:27;55:28;"- Right."
55:28;55:29;"- You know, I felt bad 'cause I thought"
55:29;55:31;"what Jake did was funny."
55:31;55:32;"- Right."
55:32;55:34;"- And I felt bad that I was smashing the like."
55:34;55:35;"- You were supporting, yeah."
55:35;55:36;"- I was smashing the like for the establishment."
55:36;55:37;"- Exactly."
55:37;55:39;"- And meanwhile, here's this young millennial comedian,"
55:39;55:43;"probably struggling, probably has a horrible life."
55:43;55:44;"- Wait."
55:44;55:45;"- I'm just making his life worse."
55:45;55:46;"- Yeah, so I tweeted about it."
55:46;55:48;"I was like, Ezra Koenig just liked"
55:48;55:51;"Jake Fogelman's roast tweet about me."
55:51;55:53;"Today's a horrible day."
55:53;55:54;"- Oh yeah, so I felt bad that I made"
55:54;55:56;"a young millennial comedian's day horrible."
55:56;55:57;"- And then you were like--"
55:57;55:58;"- Because also I do feel like,"
55:58;56:00;"here's a fact for both of you young cats."
56:00;56:02;"Do you know that I'm a millennial too?"
56:02;56:04;"- Oh yeah, it's on a technicality."
56:04;56:05;"- Yeah, it's up to like a generator or something."
56:05;56:06;"- On a technicality."
56:06;56:07;"- What's the cutoff year?"
56:07;56:09;"- The cutoff year I think is '83."
56:09;56:11;"So Jake is hardcore Gen X."
56:11;56:13;"I was born in 1984."
56:13;56:16;"So that makes me about as old as a millennial could be."
56:16;56:18;"And I'll tell you something guys,"
56:18;56:21;"it's not fun to be a member of a generation"
56:21;56:22;"when you only find out that you're a member"
56:22;56:25;"of that generation at age 29."
56:25;56:26;"You know what I mean?"
56:26;56:27;"- Yeah, which is all your best generation."
56:27;56:29;"- You guys have been called millennial,"
56:29;56:30;"well how old are you Brandon?"
56:30;56:31;"- I'm 23."
56:31;56:32;"- Okay, you guys are 22, 22."
56:32;56:34;"So you guys have been called millennials"
56:34;56:36;"since at least you were 18, 19."
56:36;56:38;"Whereas suddenly I start hearing this word millennial."
56:38;56:40;"- But can I be honest, people don't call me that."
56:40;56:42;"You just said people call you a millennial comedian."
56:42;56:43;"- What?"
56:43;56:44;"- To Brandon."
56:44;56:45;"People don't say that to me"
56:45;56:47;"and I find it a little offensive."
56:47;56:49;"- Is it because, are you more mature than Brandon?"
56:49;56:50;"- No, but it's not."
56:50;56:52;"I think it's more like, it's boring."
56:52;56:54;"I think people think I'm more boring."
56:54;56:55;"- Okay, so that's not fair because"
56:55;56:57;"Shelby's actually younger than you."
56:57;56:58;"- I'm wiling out more."
56:58;57:00;"- Before we get back into the politics of the town hall,"
57:00;57:03;"maybe we need to have a mini millennial town hall."
57:03;57:06;"(dramatic music)"
57:06;57:11;"So welcome to this millennial town hall."
57:11;57:14;"So Shelby, I've known you for a while."
57:14;57:16;"We've known each other for at least a few years."
57:16;57:19;"Brandon, I don't know you as well as I know Shelby"
57:19;57:22;"and I want to understand your perspective a little bit."
57:22;57:25;"So this is my vague take from following you on Twitter."
57:25;57:29;"Your personal brand is that you're a millennial comedian."
57:29;57:30;"You say what's on your mind."
57:30;57:32;"You love hip hop."
57:32;57:33;"- Correct."
57:33;57:35;"- You probably don't even know what rock is."
57:35;57:36;"- What's a guitar?"
57:36;57:38;"- You like EDM and hip hop."
57:38;57:39;"(laughing)"
57:39;57:41;"- What the heck is a guitar, dude?"
57:41;57:43;"- You're always talking about apps."
57:43;57:44;"(laughing)"
57:44;57:45;"Right?"
57:45;57:46;"- Yeah."
57:46;57:48;"- I listen to some sad guitar music."
57:48;57:49;"- Like the Smiths?"
57:49;57:50;"- Yeah."
57:50;57:51;"- That's a timeless one."
57:51;57:52;"- Or like brand new."
57:52;57:54;"- Oh, that emo band?"
57:54;57:55;"- Yeah."
57:55;57:56;"- So rock's not dead."
57:56;57:57;"You're like a millennial dude."
57:57;57:59;"Like this is gonna sound banan,"
57:59;58:01;"especially to someone like Jake who's still on iPhone 4"
58:01;58:03;"with the 2012 software,"
58:03;58:07;"that a lot of your comedy is made for Snapchat."
58:07;58:09;"- I mean like that's like--"
58:09;58:11;"- You're the king of the Snapchat comedy."
58:11;58:14;"- Yeah, some of my income is Snapchat."
58:14;58:18;"- You're making bank off of Snapchat."
58:18;58:19;"- Right."
58:19;58:21;"- You're literally getting paid to do stuff on Snapchat."
58:21;58:22;"- Yeah."
58:22;58:24;"- So I'm just saying like me and Jake are older grown men"
58:24;58:25;"in our 30s."
58:25;58:28;"You are a young millennial boy."
58:28;58:32;"And I wanna know what you two millennials think about things"
58:32;58:35;"because you guys are the future, straight up."
58:35;58:37;"And one thing that I find interesting is--"
58:37;58:38;"- We might not be."
58:38;58:39;"We might kill ourselves."
58:39;58:40;"- Well, 27 club."
58:40;58:41;"- Come on."
58:41;58:43;"- 27 club, baby."
58:43;58:45;"- I'm just saying we're two young artists."
58:45;58:48;"- Wow, I'm really being scandalized by you young millennials"
58:48;58:53;"talking so cavalierly about so many of our great musicians"
58:53;58:55;"who have died at a young age."
58:55;58:57;"- I fly a lot on planes with Brandon."
58:57;58:59;"- True, and also just so you know,"
58:59;59:03;"a lot of people sometimes forget that I'm the front man of a band."
59:03;59:05;"So 27 was a very stressful year for me."
59:05;59:07;"- Yeah, but you're past it."
59:07;59:09;"- I'm well past it."
59:09;59:11;"- All right, so millennial town hall."
59:11;59:12;"Back to the real issues."
59:12;59:13;"- Yeah."
59:13;59:15;"- Brandon, Snapchat or Twitter?"
59:15;59:16;"Which one's better?"
59:16;59:17;"- Twitter."
59:18;59:20;"Even though Snapchat, it makes you all this mad bank."
59:20;59:23;"- But, like, I got the bank off Snapchat off Twitter."
59:23;59:25;"- Okay, so you remember where you came from."
59:25;59:26;"- Yeah."
59:26;59:28;"- Okay, millennials do have some values."
59:28;59:30;"Shelby, what about you, Snapchat or Twitter?"
59:30;59:32;"- I mean--"
59:32;59:34;"Twitter."
59:34;59:38;"- I like how you're acting like you hate those things."
59:38;59:39;"- I don't hate them."
59:39;59:40;"They're fun."
59:40;59:41;"- They're so dumb."
59:41;59:42;"These things--"
59:42;59:44;"- They're two fun things."
59:44;59:46;"- Twitter, the thing that gave me a career."
59:46;59:48;"No, it's fine, but it is dumb."
59:48;59:50;"It's dumb that people gave me a career off Twitter."
59:50;59:52;"That is a dumb thing."
59:52;59:53;"- Okay, so I see what's going on here."
59:53;59:56;"We got two brands of millennial comedy."
59:56;59:59;"Shelby is kind of more like world weary, what is life,"
59:59;01:00:00;"what does any of this matter?"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"And Brandon--"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- I'm not world weary."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"I'm young and I'm fun."
01:00:03;01:00:08;"- Brandon's hopped up on energy drinks and Adderall"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"and he's all like Twitter's the [bleep]"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"One reason that I'm happy to have you two millennials on here"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"is because I've always wanted to do a segment on time crisis"
01:00:15;01:00:19;"where we bring together people who have had arguments"
01:00:19;01:00:24;"or beef on social media because I've gotten into the mix"
01:00:24;01:00:25;"a few times myself."
01:00:25;01:00:28;"So I want to start bringing on some of my enemies."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"I know you guys are friendly."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"But let's go back."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Okay, we're exiting millennial town hall and back into"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"time crisis town hall to talk about politics."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"[upbeat music]"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Let's put a pin in that."

01:01:55;01:01:57;"[phone ringing]"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Yo."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Hey, what's up Dave?"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Hey, what up man? You never call me."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"I call you more than most people."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"What am I in your top people that you call?"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I've always said you're top five for me."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Top five? I was top three last time."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"But all right, anyways, go on."
01:02:12;01:02:16;"My mom, my minister, my rabbi, you, maybe my sister."
01:02:16;01:02:19;"Dave, real quick, where are you right now?"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"What are you doing?"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"I'm in studio, I think the Village Recorder studio"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"in West LA wrapping up a session."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Okay, let's get right into it."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Are you going to vote in the American election?"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"I can't. I'm Canadian. I'm a Canadian citizen."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"So no."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"No."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I knew that. I was just checking."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"But if you could, who would you vote for?"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"I'm Bernie."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"You would vote for Bernie?"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Yeah, yeah."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"All right, thanks Dave."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"Don't you grab me tight."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Don't you queer me, bitch."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"Don't you walk through my words"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"'cause you ain't heard me, oh yeah."
01:03:06;01:03:11;"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Welcome back to Time Crisis Town Hall featuring two millennials."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"One reason that I was excited to have both of you on"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"is because we're talking about politics,"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"but at the end of the day, who cares about politics?"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"It doesn't affect people's lives."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"What really affects people's lives is what we do on social media"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"and how that makes us feel."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"You guys, I seem to remember, as a third-party witness,"
01:03:30;01:03:35;"got into what appeared to be political beef on Twitter."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"First things first, was it actually political beef"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"that you guys had on Twitter?"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Yes."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"Objectively, yes."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"In retrospect, I guess technically, but I truly--"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"Like when I tweeted that, in my head,"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"I was not thinking about Brandon."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"No, shut up, Shelby."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"I wasn't."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"You are not--"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"I will pull out the receipts."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"Okay, hold on, hold on."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"You are not the main thing in my head, you know what I mean?"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"I'm ready to pull out the receipts."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"You can't, I texted you about it."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"You texted me about it."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"There's no receipts."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Okay, listen, guys."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"I just want the people at home to know what we're talking about."
01:04:06;01:04:10;"So, Brandon, you wrote a tweet that said,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"""When Hillary Clinton cameos on Broad City,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"and then you remember she voted for the Iraq War"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"and was against gay marriage until she had to be for it."""
01:04:18;01:04:20;"So you were basically just trying to say that you're like--"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"you probably like Broad City."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Right."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"Great show."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"And you see Hillary Clinton--"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"That was a great episode."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"You see Hillary Clinton on it."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"But then you were saying, ""Oh, it's pretty cool that Hillary's on this,"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"but she did some things that you disagree with."""
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Right."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Oh, yeah, millennials saying the Iraq War was lame."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"Well--"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"[laughter]"
01:04:36;01:04:40;"And then Shelby tweeted at you a Huffington Post link"
01:04:40;01:04:44;"that was basically saying that Hillary Clinton,"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"contrary to some people's opinion,"
01:04:45;01:04:49;"actually had LGBT activism going back decades."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"But you went a step further, Shelby,"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"and you wrote--not adding Brandon--"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"you wrote, ""Dope that every mother[bleep]er under 25"
01:04:57;01:05:00;"turned into a radical liberal/poly-sci major"
01:05:00;01:05:03;"the second a woman became a serious presidential hopeful."""
01:05:03;01:05:04;"And then a second tweet that said,"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"""No, it's honestly really cool that you're interested in politics."
01:05:06;01:05:10;"You seem super affected by everything you've known about for the last three months."""
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Yo, I stand by those. Those are funny jokes."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"No, no, I'm with you."
01:05:13;01:05:17;"But I guess this is what people call a subtweet."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"That's a subtweet."
01:05:18;01:05:23;"Although I will say, I swear to God, you were not the main thing in my head when I tweeted that."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"It was literally two minutes after you tweeted that,"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"and so you can't act like that wasn't a subtweet."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"But see, this is the problem."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"You can't literally tweet that at me and then tweet that two minutes later."
01:05:34;01:05:37;"Well, but you did the same thing to me, quote-unquote, three weeks later."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"No, no, no."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"But I'm just saying--"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"And that night."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"No, because I'm owning my subtweets."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"I'm proud of my subtweets."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"I feel great about my subtweets."
01:05:45;01:05:49;"The thing is that if I truly did direct that at you,"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"I would have said like, ""Brandon, you're being a dumb mother[expletive] right now."""
01:05:52;01:05:54;"And I would have said that straight up."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"That was just a joke that I swear to God, you were not even the main thing."
01:05:57;01:06:03;"I was fighting with my boyfriend about Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as I was typing that."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"The point is I have a boyfriend, you guys."
01:06:05;01:06:09;"No, I'm just saying, like, this has been a problem for me for like a while,"
01:06:09;01:06:12;"and I was trying to figure out, and it was poor timing on my part."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"But you were not, but I was not in my head like, ""Yo, [expletive] Brandon."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"I'm taking Brandon down."""
01:06:16;01:06:18;"It was just like, ""I can't deal with this anymore."""
01:06:18;01:06:19;"Okay, you know what?"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"You millennials need to chill out a little bit."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Let's listen to some tunes."
01:07:21;01:07:27;"So many [expletive] people have talked over me or yelled at me or whatever about Bernie Sanders."
01:07:27;01:07:31;"They're not actually being objective about their own knowledge."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"They're acting like they are when they're not."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"And honestly, it's [expletive] me projecting."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"I have two older sisters I don't like being condescended to."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"So it's totally also me that it just gets under my skin more than other people."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"Nobody should like being condescended to, so I don't think anybody should apologize for that."
01:07:44;01:07:51;"I think, one, you were doing the things that you were talking about in that tweet by being like,"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"""Oh, every under 25-year-old."""
01:07:53;01:07:54;"Yeah, that's the joke."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"Yeah, but I think you were being condescended."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"Yeah, that's the joke, Brandon."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"That's the joke that you were being condescending to me?"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"Yes, how do you not get that?"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"No, but you were being condescending to me like directly."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Yeah, afterwards."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"But also, you were being condescending too."
01:08:08;01:08:11;"Like your thing about Broad City is also condescending."
01:08:11;01:08:16;"And when you like later were like, ""I hate Yas Queen politics,"" that's condescending."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"How is that condescending?"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"It's reductive and it's condescending."
01:08:20;01:08:24;"All right, millennials, your OG would like to speak."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"Yeah."
01:08:25;01:08:30;"Okay, so look, the rest of you, you guys had your Twitter back and forth, but let's talk about this."
01:08:30;01:08:36;"So, Brandon, you've used the phrase ""Yas Queen politics"" to describe specifically Hillary supporters."
01:08:36;01:08:41;"I think it's ""Yas Queen politics"" is like the female equivalent of Bernie Bros."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"Of Bernie Bros. Okay."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"Now, are you not a Bernie Bro?"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"I think I'm pretty textbook Bernie Bro, maybe."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"Okay."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"I don't know, but that's kind of pejorative."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"I don't know."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Bernie Bro has become a negative term, right?"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Oh, it's very negative."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"Yeah, it's very negative."
01:08:55;01:08:59;"For instance, Jake and I are elegant Bernie gentlemen."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Yeah."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"But perhaps we have a Bernie Bro in our midst."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Yeah."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Well, so, no."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"I don't even think Bernie Bro is that pejorative."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"I think it's a fun term."
01:09:09;01:09:15;"The term ""Bro"" in our culture signifies a certain type of white knucklehead."
01:09:15;01:09:20;"So when you call somebody a Bernie Bro, there was definitely a movement, I think, to imply"
01:09:20;01:09:27;"that the vast majority of Bernie Bros were white knuckleheads, which I do think was very unfair"
01:09:27;01:09:31;"to the many people who are not white knuckleheads who support Bernie."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"And I'm not even trying to say that I'm not a white knucklehead,"
01:09:33;01:09:38;"but I think there was something very pointed about that, and that wasn't fair."
01:09:38;01:09:41;"But if a white knucklehead's a Bernie Bro, let them be a Bernie Bro."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"But that said, ""Yas Queen politics."""
01:09:43;01:09:45;"Shelby, how do you feel about this phrase?"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"I mean, it's hard."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Is it sexist?"
01:09:47;01:09:51;"I thought about that a lot, and I don't-- I think I don't know."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"One thing that I'll say, like I said, Jake and I are elegant Bernie gentlemen,"
01:09:54;01:10:00;"and the last thing that we need is some young knucklehead bringing misogyny"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"into our beautiful campaign."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"So I need to make sure that, Brandon, you're not doing this."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"And that's not what I'm doing."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"But you just said you're a textbook Bernie Bro."
01:10:07;01:10:15;"I want to take that back, because as we got into what Bernie Bro means,"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"I don't want to associate with that term."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"I didn't know about the term ""Bernie gentlemen."""
01:10:20;01:10:24;"Also, for the record, I want to say I love Bernie 2016, get it popping."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"I love that."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"I think that's great."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"Let's talk about the Bernie 2016, let's get it popping movement on Twitter."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"And I like that."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"I did create that meme."
01:10:31;01:10:37;"In regards to the accusations of sexism among Bernie supporters,"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"I think it's like-- it was frustrating, because when we were talking,"
01:10:41;01:10:46;"I was saying, ""Oh, I would love if Elizabeth Warren ran."""
01:10:46;01:10:49;"And I agree, but I just think that's such a lame--"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"and again, Twitter's lame, and you don't have that many characters."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"I'm a male feminist."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Yeah, you're one of the good ones."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"I created feminism, low-key."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"That was you?"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Yeah."
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Oh my God, thank you so much."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"Thank you so much."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"I assume you guys are doing some sort of millennial comedy right now,"
01:11:04;01:11:09;"but I've got to say, you sound sexist to these 32-year-old years."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"But of course I agree."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Of course Elizabeth Warren would have been so much cooler"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"and such a better candidate, but we didn't get her,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"and though we're doing our best--"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"Yeah, so Bernie, Bernie 2016, let's get it popping."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"But I still don't think Bernie's a good candidate, though."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"Shelby, I agree with you, and I'll tell you something, guys,"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"because I'm a lot older than both of you,"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"and I'm sure Jake will agree with me on this,"
01:11:30;01:11:34;"because he's also got a lot more life experience."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"We didn't get Elizabeth Warren."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"What you're saying is correct, and you know I support Bernie."
01:11:38;01:11:42;"I support Bernie to be president, but my advice to you guys,"
01:11:42;01:11:46;"and you take this as you will, is in life you've got to play the hand you're dealt."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Right."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"Yeah."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"Well, yeah, I said--"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"No, hold on."
01:11:50;01:11:51;"Okay."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"No, no."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Go ahead."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"I'm sorry."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"I just said something profound."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"In life, you've got to play the hand you're dealt."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"On a warm summer's evening, on a train bound for nowhere,"
01:12:03;01:12:06;"I met up with a gambler."
01:12:06;01:12:11;"We were both too tired to sleep, so we took turns of staring"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"out the window at the darkness."
01:12:14;01:12:19;"The boredom overtook us, and he began to speak."
01:12:19;01:12:25;"He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces"
01:12:25;01:12:30;"and knowing what the cards were by the way they held their eyes."
01:12:30;01:12:35;"So if you don't mind my saying, I can see you're out of aces"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"for a taste of your whiskey."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"I'll give you some advice."""
01:12:41;01:12:48;"So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow."
01:12:48;01:12:53;"Then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light,"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"and the night got deathly quiet."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"And his face lost all expression."
01:12:58;01:13:01;"He said, ""If you're going to play the game, boy,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"you've got to learn to play it right."
01:13:03;01:13:09;"You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to hold 'em,"
01:13:09;01:13:14;"know when to walk away, and know when to run."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"You never count your money."
01:13:17;01:13:21;"When you're sitting at the table, there'll be time enough"
01:13:21;01:13:25;"to count when the deal is done."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"This is the Time Crisis Town Hall hotline."
01:13:27;01:13:31;"Let's hear from one half of the Bodega Boys, Deezus Nice."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"[phone ringing]"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"Yeah, what's up? Who's this?"
01:13:36;01:13:39;"Yo, what up, Deezus? It's Ezra."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"Yeah, what up, homie?"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"I'm just here at the Time Crisis Town Hall,"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"and I've got a few questions for you."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"Number one, where are you right now? What are you doing?"
01:13:47;01:13:52;"I'm in the basement. I'm watching MSNBC, and I'm drinking a beer."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"Okay, so it sounds like you're already pretty politically inclined."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"Question, are you going to vote?"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Yes, I am going to vote."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"Next question, who are you going to vote for?"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"That's a good question. I'm still not 100% decided."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"I know it's not Donald Trump or Ted Cruz."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"Probably not Hillary. I'm really feeling the burn."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Maybe Hillary. I'm flip-flopping, I'm flip-flopping,"
01:14:13;01:14:16;"but it's definitely between Hillary and Frank."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"Between Hillary and Bernie, but you're not sure yet?"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"Not 100% sure, but I feel like I'm leaning more towards Bernie,"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"because I like what he's talking about."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"We've got that New York primary coming up very soon."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"Well, thank you very much, Deezus. Talk to you soon."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"All right. Have a great night. Keep rocking, Time Crisis!"
01:14:33;01:14:38;"When the dealin's done, you got no when to hold 'em"
01:14:38;01:14:44;"No when to fold 'em, no when to walk away"
01:14:44;01:14:49;"No when to run, you never count your money"
01:14:49;01:14:55;"When you're sittin' at the table, there'll be time enough for countin'"
01:14:55;01:15:00;"When the dealin's done, you got no when to hold 'em"
01:15:00;01:15:05;"No when to fold 'em, no when to walk away"
01:15:05;01:15:10;"No when to run, you never count your money"
01:15:10;01:15:16;"When you're sittin' at the table, there'll be time enough for countin'"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"When the dealin's done"
01:15:20;01:15:25;"Girl, I'm all you want"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"You know I want it"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"Yeah, she give me looks"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"Harder than Luxor and this one"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"And dead ass, I want it"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Girl, I'm all you want"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"You know I want it"
01:15:46;01:15:50;"She see me at the party"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"She say she like my body"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"Got hot like a sauna"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"I saw the marijuana"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"She say she want my banana"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"And she wanna give me that unanani"
01:16:03;01:16:07;"Oh, oh, yeah"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"Oh, she say I'm a sweet amen"
01:16:10;01:16:13;"But she said that she don't need a man"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"Told her, ""Girl, it's okay to man"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"We gon' get higher than Peter Pan, girl"""
01:16:18;01:16:20;"I'm all you want"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Smoke the smell of wine"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"Girl, you know I want it"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Smoke the smell of wine"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"This is the Time Crisis Town Hall Hotline."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"Let's hear from Kevin Kusatsu,"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"the Commissioner of Electronic Music."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"[phone ringing]"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"Hello?"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"What's up, Kevin?"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"How you doin'? I'm good."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Where are you?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"I'm in New York City."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"First question, are you gonna vote?"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Yes."
01:16:46;01:16:49;"Second question, who are you gonna vote for?"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"It's lookin' like Bernie."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"But not decided yet?"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"I'm pretty decided, but it's lookin' like Bernie."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"I think, uh, based on, uh,"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"some literature I've read from yourself,"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"[laughs]"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"and some other things, uh, I'm, uh,"
01:17:03;01:17:06;"I gotta re-register and then vote in the primary"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"because I know the primary's important."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"True."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"I think it's time to shut down the Time Crisis Town Hall Hotline"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"because we've talked enough about politics,"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"so, uh, let's send everybody home"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"and, uh, end the town hall there."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I think we had some good conversation, Jake."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"What do you think?"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Yeah, man. A lot of ground covered."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"I mean, I do feel bad that literally every person we called"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"is pro-Bernie."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"I mean, I feel good, but I also feel bad."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"I didn't plan that."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"Yeah."
01:17:34;01:17:37;"It was interesting people were, were wavering, though."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"I almost felt like if someone was inclined to vote for Hillary,"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"they would've been self-conscious to say so."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"But maybe I'm just reading into things."
01:17:45;01:17:48;"Well, maybe they, they, they don't wanna tell me on my show."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Right."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"'Cause they know that I'm, uh, a Bernie bot."
01:17:51;01:17:55;"I don't know. I also feel bad that we didn't have any--"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Well, should I feel bad that we didn't-- You tell me."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Should I feel bad that we didn't have any Republicans on?"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"No."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"Why not?"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"They're Americans, too."
01:18:02;01:18:05;"Isn't it important to respect all different viewpoints and..."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"Yeah."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Et cetera."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Yeah, but, you know, it's, there's nothing wrong with also having--"
01:18:11;01:18:12;"It's your show."
01:18:12;01:18:15;"Um, it's, it's okay to be partisan and be like--"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"I mean, you're not a journalist."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"You're not claiming that, to, you know,"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"uh, give equal airtime to all viewpoints."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"That's true."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"And, and almost everybody that I know is a Democrat."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"And if anybody's listening who is a Republican"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"and you wanna hit me with some literature, I'll read it."
01:18:31;01:18:34;"But I'll admit, I grew up in a liberal environment."
01:18:34;01:18:37;"And the majority of people I associate with"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"are into Bernie or to the left of Bernie."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"That's my milieu."
01:18:42;01:18:46;"This is the world in which I exist."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"But I, I know there's other viewpoints out there, and, uh,"
01:18:49;01:18:50;"we can always talk about it."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"But you know what? Enough politics."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"It's giving me a headache, man."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"All these millennials having fights on Twitter."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"All these older folks also having opinions."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"It makes you just wanna hear some good music."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:03;01:19:05;"Before we get back to an old-time crisis favorite,"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"the top five."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"It's time for the top five."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"F-F-F-F-F-Five on iTunes."
01:19:13;01:19:17;"Man, I feel like it's been a while since we've done the top five."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"I'm not as up on pop music as I used to be."
01:19:19;01:19:20;"I'm not at all."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"And I'm a music industry professional, so honestly,"
01:19:23;01:19:28;"I'm not doing this just to have, like, fun commentary on what's going on."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"This is also research for me."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Totally."
01:19:31;01:19:36;"And I mean, I guess for you, like, it kind of could maybe influence your art as well."
01:19:36;01:19:41;"Not in any sort of direct way, but it was fun last fall when we did the show."
01:19:41;01:19:45;"And I started the show with you, and I just didn't know any of it."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"I didn't know what the weekend was."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Look how far you--"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Yeah, and now, and now, you know?"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Right."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"But you know what's funny?"
01:19:52;01:19:55;"As soon as the show stopped, I just, you know--"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Well, let's get back in."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"I have no idea what's going on."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Let's get into the re-education process."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Yep."
01:20:00;01:20:05;"Number five on this week's iTunes top five is a song by Zayn."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Do you know who Zayn is?"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Nope."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"Z-A-Y-N, all caps."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Okay."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Still don't know."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Nope."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"No idea."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Okay, this is a guy--"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Drop some knowledge."
01:20:16;01:20:20;"This is a guy who went solo who used to be in a very popular group."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Okay."
01:20:21;01:20:24;"The group was called--"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"It was a boy band from England."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Oh, One Direction?"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"One Direction."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Okay."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"So this guy, Zayn, left One Direction."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Okay."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"It was very controversial at first."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Why?"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"Because people love One Direction,"
01:20:35;01:20:41;"and they love the five lads who met on a singing contest."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"So it was sad for them to see Zayn go,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"but I guess everybody's friends now,"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"and now Zayn is releasing music on his own."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"So this is his first single, which is tearing up the charts."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"It's called ""Pillow Talk."""
01:20:58;01:21:01;"First six seconds, what's your impression?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"I've heard this before."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Oh, you have?"
01:21:03;01:21:06;"No, I mean, that's my impression."
01:21:11;01:21:21;"[singing]"
01:23:51;01:23:56;"[singing]"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"Unfortunately, we can't play the explicit version,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"but he is cursing in that song."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"Seems sexually explicit."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"Yeah, I don't think One Direction ever cursed."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"So this is like the stepping out, being an adult."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"This is my guess as a music industry professional,"
01:24:12;01:24:16;"that probably there was a conversation at some point that was like,"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"""You know what, man?"
01:24:17;01:24:20;"This first single is going to say so much about who you are"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"and how you're different than the rest of the lads."""
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Right, so go for it."
01:24:23;01:24:27;"So what are some things that you always wanted to do"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"that you never could do in One Direction?"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"And you'd probably say, ""Well, I want to talk about f---ing."""
01:24:31;01:24:35;"I want that explicit sticker on there."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"I've always liked them, but I never knew their music too well."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"But I imagine that their songs would probably be more like"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"on some ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" s---."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Tame."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"I'm not saying that One Direction's sexless."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"You can say that."
01:24:49;01:24:53;"No, I don't believe it, but I'm sure that there was some conversation,"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"Zayn, manager, producers, that were just like,"
01:24:56;01:25:00;"""Man, you've got to come out the gate and explain what you're offering"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"that 1D is not offering."""
01:25:02;01:25:05;"And he's like, ""How about some cursing?"""
01:25:05;01:25:09;"One Direction doesn't have to curse to sell records, but I do."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Moving on."
01:25:11;01:25:17;"Number four is by a woman--I believe she's from Nantucket--"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"named Meghan Trainor."
01:25:19;01:25:20;"Are you familiar?"
01:25:20;01:25:21;"No."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"You've never heard of Meghan Trainor?"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"No. Nantucket."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"I think she's from Nantucket."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"I love that."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"I know, it's sort of like--"
01:25:27;01:25:28;"Quaint."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"Yeah, super East Coast and quaint."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"From there, that's bizarre."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"I think she's from Nantucket."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Man, I'll feel real bad if she's not."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"Okay, what is it?"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"I'm going to nod that she's from Nantucket."
01:25:38;01:25:41;"Her song, all caps, ""No."""
01:25:41;01:25:43;"I think it's so cute"
01:25:43;01:25:47;"And I think it's so sweet"
01:25:47;01:25:51;"How you let your friends encourage you"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"To try and talk to me"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"But let me stop you there"
01:25:56;01:26:01;"Oh, before you speak"
01:26:01;01:26:04;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"My name is no"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"My sign is no"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"My number is no"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"You need to let it go"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"You need to let it go"

01:26:22;01:26:25;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"First you gonna say"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"You ain't running game"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Thinking I believe in every word"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"Call me beautiful, so original"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Telling me I'm not like other girls"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"I was in my zone before you came along"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"Now I'm thinking maybe you should go"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Blah, blah, blah"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"I be like"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"All my ladies listen up"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"If that boy ain't giving up"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"Lick your lips and swing your hips, girl"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"All you gotta say is"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"My name is no"

01:27:16;01:27:17;"Thank you in advance"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"I don't wanna dance"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I don't need your hands all over me"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"If I want a man, then I'ma get a man"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"But it's never my priority"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I was in my zone before you came along"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Don't want you to take this personal"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Blah, blah, blah"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I be like"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"All my ladies, listen up"

01:28:11;01:28:12;"I'm feeling"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"Untouchable, untouchable"

01:28:53;01:28:57;"I wonder if she's embarrassed by her Nantucket pedigree"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"I mean, you know what I mean?"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"It's like"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Well, to be from like"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"A rich people vacation spot"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"But you're like on the townie"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"Townie syndrome"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Right"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Well, I mean, you're just"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"You're trying to"
01:29:13;01:29:14;"You're trying to make like"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"New hip s***"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"You're not from"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Atlanta or New York or LA"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"You're from Nantucket"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"I mean"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"I don't know if she's like trying to be cool or edgy"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"I think part of Meghan Trainor's thing is like"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"I am who I am"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"She had a big hip before"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"That was called"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"All About That Bass"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"One thing I'll say about this song"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Now is that it's"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"It's pretty amazing"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"Like really skilled pop songwriters"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"Know how to take bits and pieces of stuff people already love"
01:29:44;01:29:48;"And I know this maybe sounds like I'm trying to be shady or something but"
01:29:48;01:29:51;"A truly skilled pop songwriter takes bits of things that feel familiar to you"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Like the"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Like that's"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Destiny's Child, right?"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"There's some other elements"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Right, right"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Like Backstreet Boys"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"But it's not copyright infringement"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"And you can't even be mad about it because it's like"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"They truly are taking these things that you like and giving you something new"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"That's like echoes of the past"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"This song I think probably the idea was a little bit to do like a pastiche of like"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"Late 90s, early 2000s stuff"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Right"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Not in"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Well"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Are you in?"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"Hold your horse one second"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"I just found out from"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"One of our producers that"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Meghan Trainor's a Hillary Clinton supporter"
01:30:23;01:30:27;"And that doesn't affect how I feel about the music at all"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"In fact"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"It honestly makes me more endeared towards Hillary"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Why?"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"Because I admire Meghan Trainor"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Because she's from Nantucket"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"She's doing her thing"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"And if she likes Hillary then makes me second guess my political stance"
01:30:40;01:30:43;"Wow, you're on flimsy ground"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Yeah, I know"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"I guess I feel like"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"I wish everybody in music could be friends"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"And support the same candidates"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"I wonder if Meghan Trainor knows who I am"
01:30:53;01:30:54;"I'm sure"
01:30:56;01:30:57;"Eh?"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Eh, I don't know"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"I'm not sure that Meghan Trainor knows who I am"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Okay, does Meghan Trainor know who Vampire Weekend is?"
01:31:04;01:31:05;"Yeah"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"I guess that's what I meant"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Well, right"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"But I don't know"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"Maybe she's like on Nantucket"
01:31:10;01:31:13;"Maybe she didn't really like care about indie"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"I wonder"
01:31:14;01:31:19;"If I ever see her at an industry professional's luncheon or party"
01:31:19;01:31:20;"I'll go up and I'll say"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Meghan, I'm a great admirer of your work"
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Maybe we disagree about who we support as a democratic candidate"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"But there's room for disagreement"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Do you know who I am?"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"No, I would never go up to somebody and ask who I am"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"It is so conceited"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"But it's like it also is a natural question"
01:31:36;01:31:37;"Sometimes you wonder"
01:31:37;01:31:38;"I admire this person"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Do they know who I am?"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"I wonder if she knows who I am"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"It's possible"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"You're from Connecticut"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"It's not far away from Nantucket"
01:31:46;01:31:49;"Let's get to number three"
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Lucas Graham"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"There's no way you've heard of Lucas Graham"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"This is the number three song on iTunes right now"
01:31:54;01:31:55;"All these names are new to me"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Yeah, these are all solo artists so far"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"Uh-oh"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"The era of the band may have passed"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Here's Lucas Graham with Seven Years"
01:32:03;01:32:13;"This also has some weird fake vintage sound effects in the beginning"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Is it like a film projector?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Yeah, I think"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"It's like watching old footage"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"This guy's watching old footage"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"I have a feeling this song's gonna be about nostalgia"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"That he shot in 2008"
01:32:22;01:32:25;"Once I was seven years old"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"My mama told me"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"Go make yourself some friends"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Or you'll be lonely"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"Once I was seven years old"
01:32:33;01:32:41;"It was a big, big world"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"But we thought we were bigger"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Pushing each other to the limits"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"We were learning quicker"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"By eleven, smoking herb"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"And drinking burning liquor"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"Never rich so we were out to make that steady bigger"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"Once I was eleven years old"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"My daddy told me"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"Go get yourself a wife"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"Or you'll be lonely"
01:33:02;01:33:05;"Once I was eleven years old"
01:33:05;01:33:13;"I always had that dream"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Like my daddy before me"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"So I started writing songs"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"I started writing stories"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Something about that glory"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Just always seemed to bore me"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"'Cause only those I really love"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Will ever really know me"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Once I was twenty years old"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"My story got told"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Before the morning sun"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"When life was lonely"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Once I was twenty years old"
01:33:37;01:33:45;"I only see my goals"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"I don't believe in failure"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"'Cause I know the smallest voices"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"They can make it major"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"I got my boys with me"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"At least those in favour"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"And if we don't meet before I leave"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"I hope I'll see you later"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Once I was twenty years old"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"My story got told"
01:34:03;01:34:06;"I was writing about everything I saw before me"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"Once I was twenty years old"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Soon we'll be thirty years old"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Got my songs up in Seoul"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"We've travelled around the world"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"And we're still roaming"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Soon we'll be thirty years old"
01:34:25;01:34:33;"I'm still learning about life"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"My woman brought children for me"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"So I can sing them all my songs"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"And I can tell them stories"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Most of my boys are with me"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Some are still out seeking glory"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"And some I had to leave behind"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"My brother, I'm still sappy"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Soon I'll be sixty years old"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"My daddy got sixty-one"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Remember life and then your life"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Becomes a better one"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"I made a man so happy"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"When I wrote a letter once"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"I hope my children come and visit"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Once or twice a month"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Soon I'll be sixty years old"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Will I think the world is cold"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Or will I have a lot of children"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Who can warmly"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Soon I'll be sixty years old"
01:35:13;01:35:21;"Soon I'll be sixty years old"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Will I think the world is cold"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Or will I have a lot of children"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Who can warmly"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"Soon I'll be sixty years old"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"So what's the narrative of this song?"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Is it a life song?"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Like he's going through the years?"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Yeah, he's going through the ages."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"You know what, it's like the Frank Sinatra song."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Which one?"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"When I was seventeen"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"It was a very good year"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"And then he keeps going and he's like"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"And then he's dead, basically by the end"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"He keeps going through the ages"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"I was thinking Jackson Browne,"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Running on an Empty"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"That's also about aging?"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"I was seventeen"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"When I called the road my home"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"And then he's like"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"In sixty-nine I was twenty-one"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"He's like going through the ages"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Lucas Graham, what do you think?"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"I think you left him"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"You look like singer-songwriter music"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"That one really seems right up your alley"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Like Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"That one seems up your alley"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Yeah, I don't know"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"I mean"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I felt the way with this"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"I feel like with all three artists so far"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"They're trying so hard"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"And I just sort of"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"His singing is super effective"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"So you prefer lazy artists"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"With no work ethic?"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I like when stuff has the illusion"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Of being effortless"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"I know nothing good is effortless"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"But I like it"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"Yeah, like the best stuff feels"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Casual and natural"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"And all three of these artists are just like"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"They all seem super stressed out"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I mean"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"Maybe stressed out"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Everything is so high strung"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Well, I think that speaks to the times"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"You know man, I understand that"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Maybe for you you're more"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"More just like chill out"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"You'd probably rather hear"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"Some peaceful, easy-feeling"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Eagles, but I think all this music"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Speaks to the time"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"It's a time of tension and stress"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"The palette, well, so was the early 70s"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"But yeah, I mean"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"The palette is just a"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Real turn off"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Just the way it sounds?"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Yeah, like the sonic palette and the performances"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"I'm surprised you don't give them props"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Both of those songs started out with this kind of"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Vintage-y, mechanical sounds"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Yeah, but if you're quoting"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Why would I give that props?"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Because it's a nod to the past"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Yeah, but that makes me like it even less"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"The fact that they're pandering"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"To try to find some texture"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"I just want to point out"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"Every time you're hearing these songs"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"And I feel like last year"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"You had a similar reaction to songs like ""Fight Song"""
01:37:59;01:38:01;"By Rachel Platten"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Consistently terrible"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"I think you came around on that one"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"You know who used ""Fight Song""?"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Oh, Hillary"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"I think we texted about that"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"And I've been writing for ""Fight Song"" for a long time"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"So many things in my life"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Point to supporting Hillary"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"And yet, I"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Nonetheless, I'm still a Bernie supporter"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Let's get into the number two song"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Right now"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"Drake"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"First artist that you're familiar with"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"This is one of his new songs"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"It's called ""One Dance"""
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Featuring Wizkid and Kyla"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Baby"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"I like your style"
01:38:39;01:38:45;"Grips on your legs"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Front way, back way"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"You know that I don't play"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"But I never run away"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"Even when I'm away"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"O.T. O.T. There's never much love"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"When we go O.T."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"I pray to make it back in one piece"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"I pray, I pray"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"That's why I need a one dance"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Got a Hennessy in my hand"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"One more time 'fore I go"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"I hope I was taking a hold on me"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"I need a one dance"

01:39:23;01:39:25;"I like your style"
01:39:25;01:39:31;"Strength and guidance"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"All that I'm wishing for my friends"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Nobody makes it from my ends"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"I had to bust out the silence"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"You know you gotta stick by me"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Soon as you see the text"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Reply me"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"I don't wanna spend time fighting"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"We got no time"

01:52:12;01:52:16;"The crystal vision"
01:52:16;01:52:24;"I keep my visions to myself"
01:52:24;01:52:32;"It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and"
01:52:32;01:52:37;"Have you in dreams you like yourself"
01:52:37;01:52:43;"Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat back to me"
01:52:43;01:52:48;"And the stealing of memories and what you had"
01:52:48;01:52:55;"And what you lost"
01:52:55;01:52:59;"And what you had"
01:52:59;01:53:04;"And what you lost"
01:53:04;01:53:12;"Thunder only happens when it's raining"
01:53:12;01:53:20;"Players only love you when they're playing"

01:53:28;01:53:35;"When the rain washes you clean you'll know"
01:53:35;01:53:44;"Oh thunder only happens when it's raining"
01:53:44;01:53:51;"Players only love you when they're playing"
01:53:51;01:54:00;"Say when they wake up and they wake up"
01:54:00;01:54:07;"When the rain washes you clean you'll know"
01:54:07;01:54:11;"You'll know"
01:54:11;01:54:14;"You will know"
01:54:14;01:54:18;"Oh you'll know"

01:54:21;01:54:25;"I'd like to thank everybody who came through Time Crisis Town Hall today."
01:54:25;01:54:29;"It's not always easy talking about politics. I don't know if we did a good job."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"We're just a couple guys."
01:54:31;01:54:37;"We're just a couple art professionals in the visual and musical realms."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"We're just kind of saying what's on our mind. You know, like you said, we're not journalists."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Yeah, we're not. Yeah."
01:54:42;01:54:46;"And any pundits out there who maybe think we got some of our facts wrong,"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"well guess what, man?"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"You shouldn't even be listening to Time Crisis."
01:54:50;01:54:55;"Time Crisis is a show about with music, people, talking about other stuff."
01:54:55;01:55:00;"What you should be doing is doing a better job writing articles for the New York Times or Slate or whatever."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"That's what I have to say to all the pundits."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"Yeah."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"I would love to thank everybody who came through and spoke with us,"
01:55:06;01:55:10;"especially Shelby Farrell and Eric Yonker,"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"because they are both people who support Hillary Clinton."
01:55:12;01:55:18;"And even though I truly, truly believe that Bernie is a better choice,"
01:55:18;01:55:25;"I can never condone the condescension or the misogyny that Hillary Clinton supporters sometimes have to go through."
01:55:25;01:55:29;"Ezra, if Hillary wins the nomination, I assume you'll vote for her?"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Yeah, I'll probably vote for her."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"Probably."
01:55:32;01:55:35;"Okay, well, hold on, Jake. I'm going to vote in New York State."
01:55:35;01:55:40;"I think it is reasonable that in a state that always goes blue, I can look at the polls."
01:55:40;01:55:45;"If somehow Trump or Cruz is up, I will 100% vote for Hillary."
01:55:45;01:55:50;"But if it looks like New York is a safe Democrat state, as it always is,"
01:55:50;01:55:55;"I think it's worthwhile to use my vote to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate,"
01:55:55;01:56:00;"who is currently the most successful female presidential candidate of all time."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"The most votes in a general election ever won by a woman, or Jill Stein."
01:56:03;01:56:10;"So I don't think there's anything wrong in a solidly blue state with voting for the Green Party."
01:56:10;01:56:13;"So I'm going to look at the polls, because I believe in being pragmatic."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"I think Bernie is a pragmatic choice."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"I don't think Bernie is like a pine-sky idealist."
01:56:17;01:56:20;"I like Bernie because he's pragmatic."
01:56:20;01:56:26;"I don't love everything about him, but I think he's a pragmatic good choice for us to get some progressive policies happening."
01:56:26;01:56:29;"Will you vote for Hillary if she gets the nom?"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"Of course."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Even here in blue California?"
01:56:32;01:56:33;"Yeah."
01:56:33;01:56:34;"Really?"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"Why can't you break off Jill Stein and vote?"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"Well, I voted for Gore in 2000."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"What state?"
01:56:40;01:56:41;"Oregon."
01:56:41;01:56:46;"Instead of Nader, because I thought Nader was a fringe candidate."
01:56:46;01:56:51;"And on a local level, I'll vote for the Green Party."
01:56:51;01:56:56;"But in the huge presidential race, it's like, if Bernie was a fringe candidate,"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"was garnering 3% of the vote, I wouldn't be supporting him."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Only the fact that he's a contender."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Right, I feel that."
01:57:02;01:57:07;"Well, I'll admit, today on the Time Crisis Town Hall, I was trying to be respectful of all the guests."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"I want to let people speak their mind."
01:57:09;01:57:13;"And the last thing I ever want to do is make somebody feel uncomfortable"
01:57:13;01:57:16;"because they support somebody that I don't support."
01:57:16;01:57:21;"But I will say, because we haven't really talked about why we specifically support Bernie,"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"so I just want to say one final thing."
01:57:23;01:57:29;"I truly believe that we can't keep choosing the lesser of two evils,"
01:57:29;01:57:33;"choosing moderate candidates who let us down so much,"
01:57:33;01:57:37;"and I throw all of the moderate Democrats under that umbrella."
01:57:37;01:57:43;"I truly believe that if we as a country can't occasionally swing a tiny bit to the left"
01:57:43;01:57:49;"and truly go for somebody who says straight up, ""No thank you"" to Wall Street,"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"I do believe that that's meaningful."
01:57:51;01:57:57;"And on a foreign policy side, man, it is tough to get excited about somebody who voted for the Iraq War."
01:57:57;01:57:59;"It's very tough."
01:57:59;01:58:02;"We could talk about this at length, and I'm sure we will continue to."
01:58:02;01:58:05;"Today was about a town hall. It wasn't just about how you and I felt,"
01:58:05;01:58:08;"so I'm glad we got some different perspectives from other people."
01:58:08;01:58:11;"Maybe next time we can get more into depth about our own feelings."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"But thank you to everybody who listened."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Thank you to everybody we called."
01:58:15;01:58:21;"Thank you to Eric Yonker, Shelby Farrow, and Brandon Wardell for bringing us their opinions."
01:58:21;01:58:24;"We'll be back in two weeks with more Time Crisis Season 2."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"Thank you for listening."
