00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"This is a very special episode."
00:06;00:09;"Jake and I check in with Winter, the god of starbucking,"
00:09;00:12;"to talk about the latest in Starbucks news,"
00:12;00:14;"Howard Schultz's presidential run,"
00:14;00:18;"and Ariana Grande's ongoing cloud macchiato disaster."
00:18;00:23;"We also count down the top hits of 1977 and 1984."
00:23;00:26;"That's right, me and Jake's birth years."
00:26;00:28;"All this, plus a little Imagine Dragons."
00:28;00:33;"This is Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:33;00:35;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts."
00:35;00:37;"One."
00:37;00:41;"# They pass me by"
00:41;00:44;"# All of those great romances"
00:44;00:48;"# The war I've felt, what we leave"
00:48;00:51;"# All my rightful chances"
00:51;00:54;"# My picture clear"
00:54;00:59;"# Everything seems so easy"
00:59;01:02;"# And so I dealt to the blow"
01:02;01:06;"# One of us had to go"
01:06;01:10;"# Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:13;"# One of us is crying"
01:13;01:16;"# One of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"# Leave the lonely man... #"
01:20;01:23;"Time Crisis, back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:25;"Uh..."
01:25;01:27;"Looking frazzled. Yeah, I'm tired, man."
01:27;01:30;"Jake's rolling into the studio with a weary..."
01:30;01:32;"Just world-weary."
01:32;01:34;"World-weary look on his face."
01:34;01:36;"I'm beat, man. We got this beat. Hands covered in paint."
01:36;01:42;"That's true. I got white, semi-gloss exterior paint on my hands."
01:42;01:44;"So, exterior, that's house paint."
01:44;01:47;"Yeah, I'm building, like, a small fence"
01:47;01:51;"that sort of is gonna divide our kind of little patio area garden"
01:51;01:55;"from our sort of sitting area, 'cause we just got a new puppy."
01:55;01:58;"That's the big development, and that's the reason I'm so white."
01:58;02:00;"But the puppy likes to run through the garden."
02:00;02:04;"In and out of the garden, she goes? Is it a female?"
02:04;02:06;"She, yeah. In and out of the garden, she goes."
02:06;02:09;"And Jake said, ""No more."" Why? Who cares?"
02:09;02:12;"Let the puppy go in the garden, man. Is she, like, eating your turnips?"
02:12;02:16;"It's hard to explain, because there's a solid, like, four-foot drop"
02:16;02:19;"from the garden down into this, like, seating area."
02:19;02:21;"It's too much of a jump for a little dog?"
02:21;02:23;"Too much of a jump. Okay."
02:23;02:26;"And to build and paint your own fence is cheaper than just, like,"
02:26;02:28;"""Can't you just go get some chicken wire?"""
02:28;02:30;"Or that's too unsightly? That was discussed."
02:30;02:32;"Too unsightly? A little bit."
02:32;02:34;"This'll be nice. This'll be classy."
02:34;02:37;"You got some friends over for some classy cocktails,"
02:37;02:40;"and people are just like, ""I gotta say, guys,"
02:40;02:42;"""the chicken wire's killing the vibe over here."""
02:42;02:45;"Backyard's looking great, but honestly, what's the deal with the chicken wire?"
02:45;02:48;"I mean, chicken wire, that just would've saved you a real headache."
02:48;02:50;"Well, the fence is not the headache."
02:50;02:53;"It's having the two dogs by myself at the studio today."
02:53;02:55;"They're running around. It's just like--"
02:55;02:58;"I'm just figuring out a new rhythm, because we have an old dog, Marty."
02:58;03:00;"He's mellow. Right."
03:00;03:02;"He'll sleep for four or five hours at a time."
03:02;03:04;"But I have two dogs now. Now you got the puppy."
03:04;03:06;"Can we say the name of the puppy? Al."
03:06;03:08;"Al, which is short for? Allie."
03:08;03:11;"Which is named after? The Lady Gaga character from Starsborne."
03:11;03:13;"[laughter]"
03:13;03:15;"No joke, folks. That's sick."
03:15;03:18;"So Marty is the Jackson, Maine, kind of old."
03:18;03:22;"Absolutely. Old, mellow, and then Allie is the star."
03:22;03:24;"A lot of energy. Hunger."
03:24;03:26;"A lot of hunger. Excitement about the world."
03:26;03:28;"Trying to find her place in the world. Yeah."
03:28;03:31;"Marty's a kind of world-weary old soul, seeing it all."
03:31;03:33;"Kind of a grump. Kind of a grump."
03:33;03:35;"So that's what I'm dealing with. I mean, it's great."
03:35;03:38;"It's a great thing to deal with, but today was a lot of back and forth."
03:38;03:41;"Is it just not worth the price to drop them off"
03:41;03:44;"at the Chateau Marmotte or the Sunset Bar-Cui?"
03:44;03:46;"It's going to be like a daily thing."
03:46;03:48;"I mean, if you have a dog, you want to have a dog."
03:48;03:50;"I'm just finding the rhythm of the dog."
03:50;03:53;"I know all sorts of people who maybe they don't have a partner or something"
03:53;03:56;"and they occasionally have to take their dog to a doggy hotel."
03:56;03:58;"Oh, yeah, on occasion. Yeah. Sure, on occasion."
03:58;04:00;"But, you know, there's just a steep learning curve"
04:00;04:03;"that I have to contend with."
04:03;04:06;"Today you were painting fences, you were painting paintings,"
04:06;04:08;"and taking care of two dogs. Yep."
04:08;04:10;"Yeah, that's a lot. I mean, it's all good."
04:10;04:13;"It's a lot to deal with. It took me forever to get over here."
04:13;04:15;"I'm coming over at rush hour. Brutal."
04:15;04:17;"We are pre-taping, folks. We are pre-taping."
04:17;04:20;"We're going to be transparent about it because we're all--"
04:20;04:23;"speaking of busyness, my schedule is getting crazy, too, man."
04:23;04:26;"You're hitting the road, right? Yeah, I got to go to England."
04:26;04:28;"Fun. Yeah, it'll be cool."
04:28;04:32;"Doing some press, doing some classic radio sessions."
04:32;04:35;"Full band in studio. Yeah, a little stripped down, though."
04:35;04:38;"Like kind of post-John Peel. Yeah, there's a lot of those."
04:38;04:40;"I mean, they have them in the U.S., too."
04:40;04:43;"I remember back in the day we'd do a lot of acoustic ones"
04:43;04:46;"where I'd just be like, ""I can never listen to that."""
04:46;04:48;"Whatever we just did probably sounds--"
04:48;04:52;"I remember on the second album we got a lot of these acoustic sessions."
04:52;04:56;"There's a lot of times like rolling into a radio station early in the morning."
04:56;04:58;"And of course, it's like you want to do it."
04:58;05:00;"If a radio station supports you by playing your music,"
05:00;05:02;"it's kind of like the least you can do."
05:02;05:04;"If you're in town, stop by."
05:04;05:07;"But then sometimes you're on tour and you're tired and you're worried about your voice."
05:07;05:12;"And so just rolling in at 9 a.m. somewhere to do an acoustic version of ""Cousins."""
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, I mean, especially if you're a band that puts all this work"
05:15;05:19;"into getting the sound down as a full plugged-in band."
05:19;05:23;"And then to just do the sort of acoustic translation."
05:23;05:25;"Well, and you never know."
05:25;05:29;"Obviously, there are songs that there could be a richness to the acoustic version."
05:29;05:31;"""Cousins"" in particular was not one of them."
05:31;05:34;"Like a fast rock song. Yeah."
05:34;05:36;"Acoustic."
05:37;05:40;"electric guitar plays"
05:40;05:56;"You will find a swell on the ocean floor"
05:56;05:59;"They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door"
05:59;06:01;"You and the small ones sit outside of each side"
06:01;06:04;"In a house on the street they wouldn't park on a night"
06:04;06:07;"That was a race, take a his was a shoemaker"
06:07;06:10;"You greatest since 2006, the list maker"
06:10;06:12;"A coach and a melody, you eat at the car"
06:12;06:15;"Or you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use 'em all"
06:15;06:18;"electric guitar plays"
06:18;06:29;"Interesting girls, I discovered myself"
06:29;06:31;"If your art life was gritty, you'd be toast in my house"
06:31;06:34;"If an interesting coach, you should be lining the walls"
06:34;06:37;"When your birthright is interest, you could just do it all right"
06:37;06:40;"Me and my cousins and you and your cousins"
06:40;06:43;"It's a line that's always running"
06:43;06:46;"Me and my cousins and you and your cousins"
06:46;06:48;"I can feel it coming"
06:48;06:51;"I rarely post provocative opinions on Twitter,"
06:51;06:54;"but I did a few weeks ago say that"
06:54;06:56;"Nirvana Unplugged was the worst thing they did."
06:56;06:58;"Oh!"
06:58;07:01;"A lot of the TC fan base was just like, ""Terrible call."""
07:01;07:02;"Really?"
07:02;07:04;"""Rough stuff, folks."""
07:04;07:06;"I stand by it, though, I mean."
07:06;07:08;"But Nirvana Unplugged, people like that"
07:08;07:11;"not because they like weird acoustic versions"
07:11;07:13;"of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" people like--"
07:13;07:14;"Which they didn't play."
07:14;07:15;"The covers."
07:15;07:16;"Yeah, they're probably--"
07:16;07:18;"""Man Who Sold the World,"" that was kind of a cool call"
07:18;07:19;"on their part."
07:19;07:21;"See, even that drives me up a wall"
07:21;07:22;"because he's using that distortion pedal."
07:22;07:23;"It's like--"
07:23;07:24;"Ah, no!"
07:24;07:26;"(imitates distortion)"
07:26;07:29;"If you're gonna do acoustic, do acoustic."
07:29;07:31;"What about the lead belly?"
07:31;07:32;"♪ In the past ♪"
07:32;07:33;"Terrible."
07:33;07:34;"♪ In the past ♪"
07:34;07:35;"♪ My girl ♪"
07:35;07:37;"It's awful."
07:37;07:38;"I mean, that was kind of interesting"
07:38;07:41;"that Kurt brought lead belly to the youth."
07:41;07:42;"Yeah, for sure."
07:42;07:43;"'Cause lead belly's sick."
07:43;07:45;"I mean, I am a Nirvana fan."
07:45;07:47;"And that's one of their last recordings, isn't it?"
07:47;07:48;"I think it is."
07:48;07:50;"I think it's like a few weeks or a few months"
07:50;07:51;"before his suicide."
07:51;07:54;"So maybe also they were in just like a terrible headspace"
07:54;07:56;"and that contributes to it."
07:56;07:57;"But whenever I just--"
07:57;07:59;"So you even remember when you saw that,"
07:59;08:01;"you were just like, ""Sucks."""
08:01;08:02;"No, I was psyched."
08:02;08:03;"I was super psyched."
08:03;08:07;"And then I think maybe the way that the versions"
08:07;08:10;"of ""About a Girl"" and a few other songs on that record"
08:10;08:13;"became the definitive radio versions."
08:13;08:14;"That bothered you."
08:14;08:16;"That kind of drove me up a wall."
08:16;08:17;"Yeah."
08:17;08:20;"It sort of became the de facto Nirvana record"
08:20;08:21;"in a lot of ways."
08:21;08:23;"It just kind of pissed me off."
08:23;08:24;"But that's how it ended up."
08:24;08:26;"I'm picturing you calling into a local Connecticut"
08:26;08:30;"alternative rock radio station, ""We got Jake on the line."""

10:18;10:20;"- Van Burry Weekend didn't unplug."
10:20;10:21;"- Really? MTV?"
10:21;10:24;"- It was kind of funny because there's the classic run"
10:24;10:26;"of '90s unplugs. - Yeah."
10:26;10:29;"- Unplugged-eds. There were so many good '90s unplugged-eds."
10:29;10:31;"- AIC. - Yep."
10:31;10:33;"- Lauryn Hill. - There were some good classic rock--"
10:33;10:34;"Rod Stewart. - Yeah."
10:34;10:37;"Yeah, again, Rod Stewart. I mean--"
10:37;10:39;"Oh, actually, Clapton, too, is so--"
10:39;10:41;"That one is so brutal. - Oh, I'm into the Clapton one."
10:41;10:45;"- That's how I got started on the Twitter with the unplugged."
10:45;10:47;"I was in an Uber, and I heard-- - ""Tears in Heaven""?"
10:47;10:49;"- No, I heard ""Layla."" That is the worst version."
10:49;10:51;"- Oh, yeah, I do hate that version of ""Layla."""
10:51;10:54;"♪ Layla, where did she-- ♪"
10:54;10:56;"Yeah, and that's also funny 'cause I heard that"
10:56;10:57;"on the radio a lot. - ♪ On her knees ♪"
10:57;10:59;"- When I was a kid, and then when I finally heard"
10:59;11:01;"the original ""Derek and the Dominoes,"" ""Layla,"""
11:01;11:03;"I was like, ""Oh, [bleep] this is so much better."""
11:03;11:05;"- Yeah, rips. - But I was introduced"
11:05;11:08;"to the Rod Stewart song ""Reason to Believe"" via his unplug,"
11:08;11:10;"which I always thought was a great song."
11:10;11:12;"- Yep. - ♪ If I listen ♪"
11:12;11:15;"♪ Long enough to you ♪ - Yep."
11:15;11:17;"- ♪ Knowing that you like-- ♪"
11:17;11:19;"I mean, he's, like, the perfect dude to do it."
11:19;11:22;"Did the Eagles do one? - I don't think so, man."
11:22;11:25;"I mean, they did an acoustic-- - They did some acoustic thing"
11:25;11:27;"in the '90s during the Hell Freezes Over."
11:27;11:29;"- Yeah, and again, that acoustic version"
11:29;11:31;"of ""Hotel California"" from Hell Freezes Over"
11:31;11:33;"that you hear all the time in, like,"
11:33;11:35;"corporate retail environments is just terrible."
11:35;11:37;"- Let's look up some of the classic unplugged dudes."
11:37;11:39;"- Let's not lose the thread, though."
11:39;11:41;"I want to hear about the Vampire Weekend one."
11:41;11:44;"- Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, there's a Mariah Carey in '92."
11:44;11:48;"- I remember she did the Badfinger/Harry Nilsson song"
11:48;11:50;"""Without You."" - Oh, yeah, a lot of people,"
11:50;11:52;"that's just a Mariah Carey song. - Right."
11:52;11:54;"- ♪ I can't live ♪"
11:54;11:56;"♪ Livin' is without you ♪"
11:56;11:58;"- ""10,000 Maniacs."" Oh, Tony Bennett."
11:58;12:00;"That was pretty classic when there was, like,"
12:00;12:02;"the kind of Tony Bennett comeback in the '90s."
12:02;12:04;"Page and Plant. - Oh, wow."
12:04;12:06;"- As Discussed, Nirvana."
12:06;12:08;"Alice in Chains. And then Shakira."
12:08;12:10;"And then now you're kind of getting out of the classic era."
12:10;12:13;"- Did Pearl Jam do one? They did one, I think."
12:13;12:15;"- Oh, interesting. The Eagles' 1994 live album"
12:15;12:18;"""Hell Freezes Over,"" which sold 9 million copies--"
12:18;12:19;"- Wow. - Good Lord."
12:19;12:21;"Though not part of the unplugged series,"
12:21;12:23;"was produced by the unplugged producers"
12:23;12:24;"and followed a similar format."
12:24;12:26;"Glenn Frey definitely called Don Henley,"
12:26;12:29;"just like, ""Yo, Henley, turn on the tube, man."""
12:29;12:30;"- [whimpers]"
12:30;12:32;"- ""You see these Nirvana guys? Oh, I don't like those guys."
12:32;12:34;"They're real noise. No, but check it out, man."
12:34;12:36;"They're doing--"" - They're just playing punk rock."
12:36;12:38;"That's all they're doing, Don. - They're just playing punk rock."
12:38;12:39;"[both laugh]"
12:39;12:41;"But they're doing a cool little acoustic set."
12:41;12:43;"""You know what? These guys actually got some chops, man."
12:43;12:45;"Turn it on. We should do this, man."
12:45;12:48;"Should I call up MTV? No, man."
12:48;12:51;"We want to have primary ownership of the content."
12:51;12:53;"I like the way you think, Mr. Henley."""
12:53;12:55;"[both laugh]"
12:55;12:58;"- Did the MTV unplugged series end?"
12:58;12:59;"- That's what I was talking about,"
12:59;13:01;"why the Vampire Weekend one doesn't really count."
13:01;13:03;"- Okay. - Because I feel like"
13:03;13:05;"around the time Vampire Weekend came out,"
13:05;13:07;"which was 2008,"
13:07;13:09;"MTV was having, like, a huge identity crisis."
13:09;13:11;"- Right. - I mean, when we came out,"
13:11;13:13;"it was such a funny time, because it was like"
13:13;13:16;"the major labels were all confused, MTV was super confused."
13:16;13:18;"We hadn't settled into this, like, current version"
13:18;13:20;"of the Internet yet, so I remember, like--"
13:20;13:22;"and MTV was cool and supportive."
13:22;13:26;"Like, we did this whole bunch of promos with them"
13:26;13:28;"when our first album came out, and I also--"
13:28;13:30;"I'm sure I've talked about this on the show before."
13:30;13:33;"Briefly, Pete Wentz, who, by the way,"
13:33;13:35;"we're trying to get on the show. - Very cool."
13:35;13:37;"- I saw him at a Neo Yokio event, and I buttonholed him."
13:37;13:39;"I was like, ""Pete, we gotta get you on the show, man."""
13:39;13:41;"He expressed some interest. - Some."
13:41;13:43;"- We gotta follow-- [laughs]"
13:43;13:45;"We gotta follow up on that, but I think he'd be a great guest."
13:45;13:47;"You know, he'll be perfect for--"
13:47;13:48;"to go on one more tangent real quick,"
13:48;13:50;"but because I'm gonna be gone so much,"
13:50;13:52;"we've been talking, we gotta bank shows."
13:52;13:54;"- Right. - And I actually wanna throw this out there"
13:54;13:56;"to the TC heads. Any ideas you have"
13:56;13:58;"for, like, bankable shows? 'Cause me and Jake"
13:58;14:00;"could probably confuse some people."
14:00;14:02;"Jake and I could probably do a bunch of fake shows,"
14:02;14:04;"bank 'em, where we're just talking about this and that,"
14:04;14:06;"and people would be none the wiser,"
14:06;14:09;"but I like the idea that we use these pre-taped shows,"
14:09;14:11;"the deeply pre-taped, 'cause we need a few on deck"
14:11;14:13;"for when I'm just, like, gone. - Weeks, months in advance."
14:13;14:16;"- I like the idea that we use those to be, like,"
14:16;14:18;"""Okay, we're doing two hours,"" or we just, like,"
14:18;14:20;"go deep with Pete Wentz. - Oh, fun."
14:20;14:22;"- You know? - Yeah, that sounds cool."
14:22;14:24;"- You know, like, just, like, walk us through, like,"
14:24;14:26;"what's your day-to-day like, man? 'Cause we've never quite done that."
14:26;14:29;"Like, kind of, like, story of your life or something."
14:29;14:31;"The other, maybe we go deep on a certain artist."
14:31;14:33;"- The band Chicago."
14:33;14:35;"- Two hours of Chicago."
14:35;14:37;"And we can still have our classic tangents."
14:37;14:40;"But maybe some TC heads have some ideas for--"
14:40;14:42;"Oh, I also have one idea that I want to do."
14:42;14:44;"I actually wish that we did this a few months ago,"
14:44;14:46;"where I just want to, like, sit down and play you the whole album."
14:46;14:49;"I think you've heard most of it, but I play you the whole album"
14:49;14:52;"and just talk about it, but almost like a time capsule"
14:52;14:54;"before it comes out. - Oh, cool."
14:54;14:56;"- Before, like, before there's reviews and reactions and stuff."
14:56;14:58;"- Right. - I just want to talk a little bit."
14:58;15:00;"- And here's the thing. I've never heard the album in order."
15:00;15:03;"- In sequence? Okay. - And I've probably heard, like,"
15:03;15:05;"two-thirds or three-quarters of it. - Mm-hmm."
15:05;15:08;"- So there's probably a few songs that-- - Oh, that'd be perfect."
15:08;15:10;"- A solid three or four or five that I've never heard."
15:10;15:12;"- Okay, that'll be perfect. So, okay, these are all some ideas."
15:12;15:16;"TC heads, if you have any other ideas for bankable shows,"
15:16;15:18;"we go deep, let us know."

16:57;17:03;"So anyway, when Vampire Weekend was kind of on the MTV scene,"
17:03;17:06;"it was like this confused era, and the reason I thought of Pete Wentz"
17:06;17:09;"is because it was this funny era where they were about like"
17:09;17:12;"five or six years out from like the video era,"
17:12;17:15;"but people still cared a lot about MTV, so they would be like,"
17:15;17:18;"""Yo, when's MTV gonna show videos again, man?"""
17:18;17:21;"And I think they took that criticism to heart, and they were like,"
17:21;17:24;"""Well, you know, maybe with this new indie boom we can involve that."""
17:24;17:27;"And one thing they did was give Pete Wentz a show."
17:27;17:30;"I forget what it was called, but it was like Pete Wentz hosted a show"
17:30;17:33;"that was all about MTV's newfound commitment to music videos."
17:33;17:38;"And so I remember me and CT came to LA to go on the show"
17:38;17:44;"to present the Oxford Comma video, and the guests were Katy Perry"
17:44;17:48;"and a couple other people, and this is like real early days Katy Perry,"
17:48;17:51;"like maybe first album."
17:51;17:54;"I remember the rapper Lil Mama was there,"
17:54;17:56;"'cause we chopped it up with her backstage a little bit."
17:56;17:59;"And then--I think I've talked about this on the show--somewhere,"
17:59;18:03;"'cause I knew a producer at MTV who told me how one segment they did"
18:03;18:06;"was 'cause Lil Wayne was there, was they showed him all the videos of the day,"
18:06;18:09;"and that--I still don't know if this is true. I gotta check in with this dude."
18:09;18:12;"- And they're filming this. - Yeah, but they didn't air it."
18:12;18:16;"So somewhere at MTV, supposedly, there's video of Lil Wayne"
18:16;18:19;"watching and reacting in real time to the Oxford Comma video."
18:19;18:23;"And supposedly, according to this guy, Lil Wayne--'cause that's a one-shot video"
18:23;18:25;"directed by Richard Ayoade. Shout out to him."
18:25;18:28;"Lil Wayne watched, and he was like, ""Whoa, that whole thing was one shot?"""
18:28;18:30;"Not that we invented that or anything, but he was watching that,"
18:30;18:32;"and he's like, ""That's one shot?"" He's like, ""Yeah, that's cool."
18:32;18:35;"I wanna do something like that."" And then shortly thereafter,"
18:35;18:38;"he made a video for his song that was huge at the time called ""A Milli,"""
18:38;18:40;"and that was a one-shot video."
18:40;18:42;"So supposedly, it was inspired by Oxford Comma."
18:42;18:44;"I gotta--we gotta track down this footage. I just wanna know--"
18:44;18:47;"- It's a direct linkage. - I wanna know what he was saying."
18:47;18:50;"So there was that, and then I remember maybe on the second album,"
18:50;18:52;"they were trying to bring back ""Unplugged."""
18:52;18:55;"So that's why I don't count it as part--it's not part of the classic ""Unplugged"" run."
18:55;18:58;"- This was kind of like-- - It was branded as MTV Unplugged."
18:58;19:01;"It was branded as MTV Unplugged, but you could just tell it was like--"
19:01;19:03;"you know, it wasn't the same crew."
19:03;19:05;"So it was material from the first two records?"
19:05;19:08;"Yeah, it exists somewhere. I also remember being there and just being, like,"
19:08;19:10;"really burned out, and we were doing an acoustic thing."
19:10;19:12;"And I think we had, like, some, you know, string section come,"
19:12;19:14;"and we tried to spruce it up."
19:14;19:17;"But I have this memory of kind of ripping into A-Punk, like, on an acoustic."
19:17;19:19;"[singing]"
19:19;19:21;"And then I'd just be like, ""Joanna drove Sully into the--"""
19:21;19:23;"And I was like, ""Whoa."""
19:23;19:26;"You know, and it's not live, so I was like--kind of, like, forgot the lyrics."
19:26;19:28;"And then I had this, like, weird brain meltdown for, like, four minutes,"
19:28;19:31;"where I started three times, and I just couldn't get the lyrics right."
19:31;19:33;"- Really? - Yeah, it was strange."
19:33;19:35;"Has that happened before or since?"
19:35;19:38;"Yeah, my mind--one thing I've realized is if I can't let my mind wander,"
19:38;19:40;"I will mess up the lyrics."
19:40;19:42;"Even if I start thinking too much about, like, the sound of the band"
19:42;19:45;"or my guitar playing, you know, my mind will wander."
19:45;19:48;"Because sometimes you just, like--I'm just singing, and then I'm like,"
19:48;19:51;"""Whoa,"" I can snap back into it. It's like I was gone."
19:51;19:53;"- Yeah, yeah. - You know, so I might mess up a word or two."
19:53;19:56;"- Sure, and just keep going. - Or start the wrong phrase."
19:56;19:58;"Like, I might just hit the wrong-- [singing]"
19:58;20:00;"- And kind of get back in. - Yeah."
20:00;20:02;"- This was unusual. - Wow."
20:02;20:04;"Maybe because it was a TV show, I was more in my head or something."
20:04;20:07;"And was there, like, a studio audience watching you, like--"
20:07;20:09;"- Yeah. - --have all these false starts?"
20:09;20:11;"Yeah, and I was just like, ""Sorry, guys."""
20:11;20:13;"And were the other guys in the band like, ""No, the lyrics are this,"""
20:13;20:15;"- or they don't know the lyrics? - Yeah, no, no, I think--yeah,"
20:15;20:17;"I feel like I was getting some assistance."
20:17;20:20;"Oh, man. That makes me think of, like, when, like, Second Baseman,"
20:20;20:22;"like, all of a sudden can't throw to first base."
20:22;20:24;"- Yeah, it's just a mind game. - This happens every now and then."
20:24;20:26;"- Yeah, they're just getting to it. - Or, like, in tennis,"
20:26;20:28;"like, somebody just wails two serves into the net."
20:28;20:31;"Yeah, I mean, I'm talking about, like, this happens where, like,"
20:31;20:34;"some sort of switch is flipped, and, like, a catcher"
20:34;20:36;"loses the ability to throw back to the pitcher."
20:36;20:38;"- Forever? - Oh, no, it's ruined careers."
20:38;20:40;"I mean, it's rare, but it does happen."
20:40;20:42;"Can't throw back to the pitcher?"
20:42;20:44;"It becomes, like, a mental thing of, like--"
20:44;20:46;"- they just become so psyched out. - Really?"
20:46;20:49;"It happened famously to Chuck Knobloch, who was a second baseman."
20:49;20:51;"- Uh-huh. - And, like, he stopped being able"
20:51;20:53;"to throw to first base during routine plays."
20:53;20:55;"And there was nothing physically wrong with his arm?"
20:55;20:57;"- No, no, it was just mental. - Whoa."
20:57;20:59;"It was, like, the most basic thing you can do."
20:59;21:01;"- So, it's going in other directions? - Yeah, presumably."
21:01;21:04;"I mean, that's why sports psychology is a real industry."
21:04;21:06;"Hopefully that doesn't happen to you this tour."
21:06;21:08;"Oh, wait, I'm reading about it."
21:08;21:10;"""During the summer of 2009, MTV.com"

22:08;22:10;"Yeah, with guitars, sure."
22:10;22:12;"Yeah, I guess I'm thinking of the other bands."

22:16;22:18;"I don't know Paramore or All Time Low."
22:18;22:21;"They got some good songs, but they kind of come out of more of a..."

22:23;22:26;"Dude, you mentioned when you were running through the earlier versions,"
22:26;22:28;"10,000 Maniacs."
22:28;22:31;"I heard a song of theirs the other day that reminded me so much of Vampire."
22:31;22:33;"Really?"
22:33;22:36;"Yeah, if you bring up 10,000 Maniacs, it's not their biggest song."
22:36;22:38;"It was probably their second biggest song."
22:38;22:40;"And this is the band that Natalie Merchant was the singer of?"
22:40;22:42;"Yeah, they're like an upstate New York..."
22:42;22:44;"Oh, right, they did Because the Night."
22:44;22:46;"I like The Weather is the one that reminds me of Vampire."
22:46;22:50;"Wow, 10,000 Maniacs, MTV Unplugged, sold 2.3 million."
22:50;22:51;"Wow."
22:51;22:52;"That's wild."
22:52;22:54;"Collapsed it and sold 7.7."
22:54;23:05;"This part reminded me of early Vampire."
23:05;23:07;"It's a cool song."
23:07;23:14;"# If my head found me pillow land and fall again"
23:14;23:21;"# Shivering my bones just thinking about the weather"
23:21;23:28;"# Quivering my lip as if I might cry"

23:36;23:42;"# It seems this bed is where I never leave"
23:42;23:45;"They kept going after Natalie Merchant left the band."
23:45;23:47;"Oh, wow."
23:47;23:49;"Yeah, I don't know much about them."
23:49;23:54;"And then what were the big Natalie Merchant songs?"
23:54;23:58;"Oh, yeah."
23:58;24:04;"Yeah, this is more like kind of coffee shop, like feel good."
24:04;24:07;"Although actually, this is like a little crunchier than I remember."
24:07;24:09;"That guitar like going wild."
24:09;24:20;"# Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me"
24:20;24:28;"# Stand over my bed disbelieving what they see"
24:28;24:36;"# They say I must be wonder, no wonder, that's on creation"
24:36;24:43;"# And as far as they see they can offer no explanation"
24:43;24:46;"Good vibe."
24:46;24:50;"Must have been a bummer for the band"
24:50;24:54;"because I feel like she hit her kind of commercial peak going solo."
24:54;24:55;"Yeah."
24:55;24:57;"I wonder what the backstory there was."
24:57;25:03;"# Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
25:03;25:07;"# Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
25:07;25:10;"# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
25:10;25:11;"Oh, yeah, this one."
25:11;25:13;"# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
25:13;25:18;"See, this stuff is kind of like adjacent to like Paula Cole or something."
25:18;25:20;"Oh, yeah, I might have my timing wrong,"
25:20;25:22;"but I feel like Natalie Merchant really like paved the way"
25:22;25:25;"for the Paula Coles and the Sarah McLachlans,"
25:25;25:27;"the whole Lilith Fair crew."
25:27;25:31;"I feel like Natalie Merchant was a contemporary with Sarah McLachlan."
25:31;25:33;"Is it McLaughlin or McGlocklin?"
25:33;25:34;"I always said McGlocklin."
25:34;25:35;"McGlocklin, OK."
25:35;25:38;"# I don't know, keep on giving"
25:38;25:41;"But that 10,000 Maniac song from '87, I was like,"
25:41;25:42;"I heard it the other day and I was like,"
25:42;25:45;"oh, this is like a little vibe-ier."
25:45;25:51;"# For your selflessness"
25:52;25:55;"# My admiration"
25:55;25:57;"Although I have to say, I'm pretty done with this."
25:57;25:59;"Oh, this Natalie Merchant stuff, actually,"
25:59;26:01;"I haven't heard it in 15, 20 years."
26:01;26:03;"It's a little vibe-ier than I remember."
26:03;26:04;"Yeah."
26:04;26:09;"# I'm bound to thank you for it"
26:09;26:28;"That's tight. Lilith Fair, Celebration. Something came up. This is at Lilith Fair, volume 1,"
26:28;26:33;"which is all stuff from Lilith Fair. Paula Cole. What year? Well this came out in '98."
26:33;26:39;"I think that's when Lilith Fair was popping. Okay. McLaughlin. Oh, Tracy Chapman, sure."
26:39;26:43;"Jewel. Indigo Girls. I haven't heard them in a minute. Indigo Girls are great. They"
26:43;26:48;"have some great songs. This is a cool road we're going down right now. We're just going"
26:48;26:51;"deep on artists who performed at Lilith Fair. I feel like there was a thing that Lilith"
26:51;26:56;"Fair was coming back. Yeah, it was like Liz Fair gonna play it? I feel like... Oh yeah,"
26:56;27:12;"this is a classic. Oh yeah, Closer to Fun. Yeah, this is a classic. You think Jerry listened"
27:12;27:18;"to Indigo Girls? Yeah, I bet he did. I could picture that. That's a sweet song, man. Jerry"
27:18;27:39;"Garcia band cover of this. That'd be tight. That four on the floor kick drum, they're"
27:39;27:44;"almost like the original Mumford and Sons. Oh wow, interesting. Does Mumford do harmonies"
27:44;27:51;"this tight? Like two part? Yeah, yeah. Oh my God, Nick just found the Indigo Girls opened"
27:51;27:58;"up for the Grateful Dead in Eugene, Oregon, August 22nd, 1993. That is so tight. That's"
27:58;28:23;"sick. That's awesome. Indigo Girls are definitely ahead of the curve, because they were doing"
28:23;28:30;"that stuff, I feel like in the 80s. They were way before that kind of 90s wave of Coffeehouse,"
28:30;28:55;"you know? I love that percussion in the background. I know, the percussion's almost like... Is"
28:55;29:02;"it like a beat off of a synth thing, or is it a very well recorded... Or they just got"
29:02;29:07;"a sick Latin percussionist who's just like... And then he just picks up the egg shaker."
29:07;29:27;"Oh yeah, where'd the... Where'd the bongo go? That was cross stick. You know who's also"
29:27;29:32;"like a heavyweight in this scene is Melissa Etheridge. Oh yeah, she's... I mean, this"
29:32;29:36;"kind of reminds me of Etheridge a little bit. She seemed like she steered clear of the Lilith"
29:36;29:43;"Foundation though. What's up with that? That could be a good deep... Time goes going two"
29:43;29:47;"hours trying to get the bottom. Was Melissa Etheridge invited to play? I mean, she clearly"
29:47;29:52;"is one of the biggest female artists of the 90s. Seems like quite an oversight. Well,"
29:52;29:58;"first let's double check. I also love that you're just kind of like, ""Oh, Etheridge steered"
29:58;30:04;"clear of the Lilith Foundation."" I'm completely just making things up. But I'm looking at"
30:04;30:09;"the list right here of main stage artists. Maybe she felt a little too big. The money"
30:09;30:14;"wasn't right. That's funny. I mean, I'm seeing some heavyweights on that list though. Who"
30:14;30:18;"else? Put that list back up, the main stage. Yeah, who's on the main... Oh, Bonnie Raitt."
30:18;30:22;"I mean, come on. Crow? Sheryl Crow. Cowboy... I was listening to some cowboy junkies recently."
30:22;30:29;"Oh, Erykah Badu? Wow. Liz Phair, Lauryn Hill, Emmylou Harris. I mean, come on. I wonder"
30:29;30:32;"if it was Hubris. There's beef, man. I wonder if it was Hubris. Melissa Etheridge was like,"
30:32;30:36;"""I'm selling millions of records right now. You tell them to get the money up or they"
30:36;30:39;"can kiss my ass. They need me more than I need them."" I don't need some hippie festival."
30:39;30:44;"Yeah, fuck that shit. But Melissa, this is good for women's empowerment. There's never"
30:44;30:50;"been a female festival this big. I don't want to be pigeonholed as just some female artist."
30:50;30:58;"I'm an artist. I only know one gender. That's green. It's me. It doesn't work as well when"
30:58;31:01;"you're talking about gender. I feel like this is like a classic in a movie where they're"
31:01;31:06;"appealing to somebody on racial grounds. I only see one color and that's green. Oh my"
31:06;31:13;"God. What was the big... I only know one sexual orientation. That's green. Okay. What is the"
31:13;31:19;"story? What's the biggest Melissa Etheridge song? Is it ""Come to my window""? See, that's"
31:19;31:24;"not as good as those Indigo Girl songs. I mean, maybe I'm just... I'm talking crazy right"
31:24;31:28;"now. They're different artists. I mean, they're definitely two of the, especially in that"
31:28;31:49;"era of the biggest openly gay female singers. Right. Oh, I'm the only one. Oh yeah. Oh,"
31:49;32:02;"this is rough. I mean, I'm not that mad at it. I'm pretty out. This is kind of a bluesy"
32:02;32:17;"bar band. Oh, this is so gnarly. She's actually got a new album coming out April 12th called"
32:17;32:39;"The Medicine Show. Cool title. I mean, she's got a real set of pipes. For sure."
32:39;32:53;"This would go great on a mixtape next to Dave Matthews Band's ""Satellite."" I feel like"
32:53;32:57;"this is a whole wave of kind of like chill out, 90s coffee shop music that always has"
32:57;33:26;"an organ. Right. That was a pretty sick change. This is a better song. Yeah. Jerry Gould's"
33:26;33:35;"Garcia Band, ""Nine Minute Come to My Window,"" 1994. Right. Very late. Honolulu Civic Center,"
33:35;33:43;"Hawaii. They just did it once, folks. I feel like Jerry thought better of it. You come"
33:43;33:48;"across like that all the time. That's a funny list. Like the songs that The Dead or JGB"
33:48;34:05;"just did once. Right. That's a deep list. Let's see if any of the songs are out yet"
34:05;34:26;"from the new Melissa Ethel job, ""Faded by Design."" Her voice dropped a little bit. Yeah,"
34:26;34:30;"it still sounds good. Yeah, a little. It sounds good. Honestly, she's keeping that pretty"
34:30;34:44;"like tasteful 90s palette. Yeah, she's going strong with it. She had a kid with David Crosby,"
34:44;34:48;"right? Well, he's the sperm donor. Right. Which, yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah, yeah."
34:48;34:52;"She and her partner asked David Crosby to be the sperm donor. I wonder how old that"
34:52;35:13;"kid is now. Maybe in their 20s. No, maybe not quite. We got to get on the phone to Winter."
35:13;35:16;"Oh, yeah, yeah. We've been meaning to talk to Winter for people who don't remember. I"
35:16;35:22;"find that hard to believe you're true. TC had Winter as a legendary Time Crisis guest,"
35:22;35:27;"friend of the show. He's the inventor of Starbucking. He's been to tens of thousands of Starbucks"
35:27;35:31;"around the world. And honestly, Starbucks has been in the news quite a bit lately, and"
35:31;35:34;"we've been wanting to get the Winter take on it. So let's get him on the horn. Now,"
35:34;35:43;"let's go to the Time Crisis hotline. Hey, Winter. Hello. Hey, what's up, man? Welcome"
35:43;35:49;"back to Time Crisis. Hey, it's good to be here. Love talking to you guys. How are you,"
35:49;35:54;"Jake Ezra? Doing well. We're doing all right, man. I feel like with this appearance, you're"
35:54;35:59;"getting up there for maybe one of our all time most frequent guests. Well, you gentlemen"
35:59;36:04;"do talk about Starbucks quite a bit. I've been working my way backwards through Time"
36:04;36:10;"Crisis episodes and boy, I've been missing some great stuff. Well, and part of the reason"
36:10;36:14;"we wanted to call you is because, as always, Starbucks is in the news, maybe now more than"
36:14;36:20;"ever. I think they're always in the news. That's true. I guess to start, Howard Schultz"
36:20;36:23;"running for president. I mean, what is going on, man? I've been thinking about it since"
36:23;36:29;"you talked about it recently. And the fact is, I don't know if he can win. So I didn't"
36:29;36:33;"think about it too much when the announcement originally came out. But then he went and"
36:33;36:38;"gave that interview where he said that we can't afford health care for all. And he lost"
36:38;36:42;"me right there. No billionaire should be telling the American people that they can't afford"
36:42;36:46;"health care when he can afford the best health care for himself and his family that he wants."
36:46;36:51;"Right on. Yeah, I agree. I mean, what's he thinking? I mean, he used to seem like a relatively"
36:51;36:55;"chill dude. Like, I feel like I saw a tweet or something a while ago where somebody said"
36:55;36:59;"he were getting excited about a candidate, maybe even somebody we love like Bernie. And"
36:59;37:03;"somebody said, you know, like, whatever. That's cool. But just keep in mind, anybody who actually"
37:03;37:07;"runs for president is insane. And, you know, I would cut Bernie some slack and some of"
37:07;37:11;"these people have truly been public servants for decades. At least that's as good as it"
37:11;37:14;"gets where you kind of like, OK, you've been doing your thing for a while, but these people"
37:14;37:18;"just throwing their hats in the ring. I want to be president. It's really bonkers. And"
37:18;37:23;"also, it's embarrassing. Howard Schultz is just destroying his legacy in a way. Well,"
37:23;37:27;"he's certainly got people riled up, that's for sure. And he's not doing Starbucks any"
37:27;37:32;"favors. So, Winter, I mean, you've been in and out of Starbucks nonstop the last few"
37:32;37:36;"months, I'm assuming. Have you talked to anyone at the stores about it at all? Has it come"
37:36;37:40;"up? It has not come up at the stores. I've only read about it online. And as a matter"
37:40;37:46;"of fact, I haven't been in and out of Starbucks that much. I had a bit of a crisis myself"
37:46;37:53;"with my family after I spoke to you guys in L.A. Oh, man. And I've sort of had to take"
37:53;37:59;"care of my mother. And that has put a real damper on my Starbucks. And I've basically"
37:59;38:04;"been working since last year to help pay for her care. But I'm hoping to get back on the"
38:04;38:10;"road either later this year across the pond and hit some Asian and European stores, or"
38:10;38:15;"maybe next year. Just I need to save up enough to ensure that she's well taken care of. And"
38:15;38:19;"I've been focusing on Scrabble, too, while I'm out here on the East Coast working because"
38:19;38:23;"this is a hub of tournament Scrabble, trying to get up to master ranking. Well, first of"
38:23;38:27;"all, I hope everyone's all right. And I hope that you can be back to. Sorry to hear that."
38:27;38:30;"Sorry to hear that. And I hope your mom's all right and you can be back to Starbucks"
38:30;38:35;"soon. But back to the Scrabble, though, for a second, can you just prepare by playing"
38:35;38:39;"online Scrabble or you have to do something even more extreme? There have been some players"
38:39;38:46;"who have played online Scrabble exclusively because they don't have access to live opponents"
38:46;38:50;"and then they'll show up at a tournament and they'll do all right. But I only play with"
38:50;38:55;"the board. I never play online. Interesting. So, Howard Schultz, he lost you with his policy."
38:55;38:59;"I already saw he had some quote the other day, the kind of corny thing where he said"
38:59;39:03;"how Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi can't even be in the same room as each other. They hate"
39:03;39:07;"each other, which obviously they've still been in the same room. And he said, we can't"
39:07;39:11;"have a country like that. Whereas me, I'll have everybody come visit me in the office"
39:11;39:15;"and we'll talk things over over some coffee. He's a great dealmaker. Some Starbucks coffee."
39:15;39:20;"He went his way to point out. I mean, I know Schultz probably thinks he's the anti-Trump,"
39:20;39:23;"but come on, man. In the mirror, bro. Look in the mirror. Yeah, he has a little bit too"
39:23;39:27;"much money. Although I do have one question for you, Winter. Part of the reason, as I"
39:27;39:32;"recall, that you got into Starbucking in the first place back in the nineties was because"
39:32;39:37;"when you first started experiencing Starbucks, you were impressed by how they were run, how"
39:37;39:42;"the business was run and the general vibe of the stores. Is that true? That's correct."
39:42;39:48;"And the consistency of the coffee 20 years ago, it really was some of the best coffee"
39:48;39:53;"that you could find in most cities in America. Recently, y'all were talking about Omaha,"
39:53;39:58;"for example, and how you can get nitro good coffee in Omaha now. Yeah. 20 years ago. I"
39:58;40:01;"don't know that you could have gotten good coffee in Omaha. Starbucks might've been your"
40:01;40:07;"best bet. Exactly. Does that win Schultz any points in your book? Do you ever stop and"
40:07;40:14;"say, okay, universal health care, that would be nice. But if Schultz actually got reinvigorated,"
40:14;40:17;"maybe he's a little burned out on Starbucks and he wants a new project. And if he could"
40:17;40:21;"promise you that he could take America as a nation to that same feeling you had when"
40:21;40:26;"you walked into like a Starbucks in 96, could that maybe win you over to vote? Absolutely"
40:26;40:32;"not. I give Schultz no points towards the white house or the success that he brought"
40:32;40:39;"Starbucks. And I don't want that feeling. What I want is for people to have health care"
40:39;40:47;"and for the growing inequality gap to be diminished and for greater rights for disadvantaged groups"
40:47;40:53;"like women and minorities and homosexuals. So that is what I care about. Not the feeling"
40:53;40:59;"that I got when visiting a Starbucks straight shooter. I was in sense. I dig it. Okay. I"
40:59;41:03;"would say your priorities are officially in order. Although it does surprise me that if"
41:03;41:08;"he really wanted to try to spin his corporate experience into something, he could say something"
41:08;41:14;"like, listen, Donald Trump had a whole crazy real estate business. I ran a business that"
41:14;41:19;"actually was on the ground dealing with a lot of people every day. I wasn't just selling"
41:19;41:23;"apartments to rich people. I was bringing coffee to all sorts of people around the country."
41:23;41:27;"And I want to use that experience to do something positive with healthcare and create universal,"
41:27;41:31;"you know, even that though he can't promise. And Starbucks was known for providing healthcare."
41:31;41:35;"Yeah. That's weird too. You were, was 20 hours a week. Is that, or what? 30 hours? Right."
41:35;41:40;"So yeah, that's exactly right. Part timers, 20 hours a week. Why can't he at least promise"
41:40;41:45;"the Starbucks model? As long as you're able bodied, you work 20 hours a week. Maybe, you"
41:45;41:49;"know, do a shift at the post office, maybe help clean up a part. That'd be, that would"
41:49;41:54;"almost be like the new deal. The new Starbucks deal. I think he's disconnected from the American"
41:54;42:01;"people. Schultz give up man. Bad vibes until Schultz stops running for president. Coffee"
42:01;42:06;"being all day. Oh, hell yeah. Third wave all the way. Make it at home. Oh, deeply."
42:07;42:12;"Your breath is sweet with your eyes are like two jewels in the sky."
42:12;42:19;"Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie."
42:19;42:26;"But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love."
42:28;42:46;"Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above. One more cup of coffee before I go."
42:46;42:55;"Winter, have you tried the Ariana Grande? I did. I heard you folks talking about it"
42:55;43:00;"and I decided to try it for myself. And I think I'm on the same page as you, Jake."
43:00;43:09;"It is too sweet and it has too many calories and there's no way that I would have one of those at"
43:09;43:14;"every Starbucks, like you suggested. I've thought about you doing that, like"
43:14;43:20;"slamming like 12 of those in a day. Oh God. It's like just a true nightmare. Just cardiac arrest."
43:20;43:28;"Oh God. I'd be in the grave. Yeah, you'd be dead. Now, if Ariana Grande was out there with me"
43:28;43:32;"to spend some time with her, might be worth it. But I don't know if I want to kill myself for that."
43:32;43:35;"Okay. Wait, hold on, Winter. I like this angle. Are you a fan?"
43:35;43:40;"Oh sure. She's got chops. People dismiss her, but she can actually sing."
43:40;43:44;"Oh, she can definitely sing. But hold on, Winter. There's a little more to the story that we found"
43:44;43:51;"out since the last episode. So as discussed, one of the prominent ingredients in the Cloud Macchiato"
43:51;43:58;"Ariana Grande Starbucks beverage is egg whites. Well, it turns out that Ms. Grande is a vegan."
43:58;44:01;"Yes. There's a whole wing of her fan base,"
44:01;44:08;"which are vegan Ariana Nominators. And they're up in arms because there's no version of the drink"
44:08;44:13;"that they can make that's vegan. Even if you replace the milk with soy milk, there's still"
44:13;44:17;"the eggs. So she hasn't even vetted it. Well, that's what we don't know. I assume that Ariana"
44:17;44:21;"was very involved in the research and development phase of this beverage. What's your take on that,"
44:21;44:25;"Winter? Are the vegan Ariana Nominators right to cancel her?"
44:25;44:31;"Well, I mean, to come to her defense, she could have just legitimately missed it. So what she"
44:31;44:37;"needs to do now is own up to it and say that she's going to work with Starbucks to see if they can"
44:37;44:43;"figure out how to do it in a vegan way. I don't know if that's possible, but I do think that her"
44:43;44:50;"fans have a legitimate complaint. It's been blowing up my Google Starbucks alerts."
44:50;44:53;"Oh, really? I'll tell you that. Yeah. It's all over my"
44:53;44:58;"Google News feed. I see it like every day. Oh, really? That's dominating the Starbucks"
44:58;45:00;"news cycle? Yeah."
45:00;45:04;"I mean, it's just a dumb drink. They could just... We need Howard Schultz to weigh in on this."
45:04;45:08;"If we have any political journalists listening, next time you're at a Howard Schultz press"
45:08;45:14;"conference being like, ""How do you expect to run America when you can't even deal with Ariana"
45:14;45:19;"Grande's beverage properly?"" I mean, that's a crisis. That's a bad look for Starbucks. It's"
45:19;45:24;"a bad look for Ariana. It's a bad look for Cloud Macchiato's. I was trying to think of some"
45:24;45:28;"charitable takes on this because I'm just a charitable guy. What do you think about this,"
45:28;45:32;"Winter? I'm not a vegan, but I've always respect the shit out of vegans."
45:32;45:32;"Hell yeah."
45:32;45:38;"Anybody listens to TC knows that I don't make fun of vegans. I think making fun of vegans"
45:38;45:42;"is weak, and I will be vegan at some point."
45:42;45:44;"I do respect them. Yes."
45:44;45:49;"I respect the hell out of vegans. And also just making fun of vegans is just so lame."
45:49;45:50;"Who does that?"
45:50;45:53;"Oh, so many people. People associate vegans with being sanctimonious."
45:53;45:54;"Sure."
45:54;45:57;"And my one thing that I'll say is like, the earth is dying."
45:57;45:57;"Yeah."
45:57;45:58;"And-"
45:58;45:59;"They got cause."
45:59;46:04;"People are sanctimonious about all sorts of nonsense. Honestly, your lifestyle is"
46:04;46:08;"creating way less pollution. Like you could be a little sanctimonious. I know some vegans very"
46:08;46:13;"well. I've never had anybody watch me like eat something and be like, what the fuck is wrong"
46:13;46:17;"with you? But if a vegan said like, Hey man, I know you eat a lot of meat. I, you know, I don't"
46:17;46:22;"want to bother you, but maybe you might want to know why I don't. I don't think that's overstepping."
46:22;46:23;"That'd be annoying."
46:23;46:26;"It'd be annoying, but I'd still, I wouldn't be irate about it."
46:26;46:26;"For sure."
46:26;46:30;"Oh, and also Nick said that he saw footage of her drinking it somewhere. So maybe she's not"
46:30;46:35;"even a real vegan and maybe Arnie Granny could say, guys, you caught me red-handed. I'm not a"
46:35;46:40;"real vegan. If you come by my house, I'll just be eating, you know."
46:40;46:40;"Scrambled eggs."
46:40;46:45;"I'll be eating scrambled eggs. I mean, she's originally from New Jersey, so she might go"
46:45;46:48;"straight to the fridge and get one of those pre-sliced packages of pepperonis and just pop"
46:48;46:50;"them in her mouth."
46:50;46:51;"Meatball sub."
46:51;46:54;"She's probably eating meatball subs. She's eating chicken parms."
46:54;46:57;"She's saying she's vegan because it's like a chic, cool thing."
46:57;47:00;"Perhaps. She's eating veal parmesan."
47:00;47:01;"We're throwing her under the bus here."
47:01;47:06;"No, no, we're pro. Hold on. I didn't get to the end of the story. You know I'm team,"
47:06;47:10;"I'm an Ariana and then a later. So, you know, deep down at the end of the day,"
47:10;47:12;"guys, you caught me red-handed. I'm a Jersey girl."
47:12;47:17;"I mean, you really think I'm going to go more than a week without eating a veal parmesan?"
47:17;47:18;"Jersey girl."
47:18;47:21;"And she's like, all right, guys, you caught me red-handed. I'm not a real vegan."
47:21;47:25;"And people say, so did you say it just to win some clout?"
47:25;47:29;"Yeah, the clout was nice, but also I'm an influential person."
47:29;47:30;"I don't personally have the resolve."
47:30;47:32;"OK."
47:32;47:34;"To go more than six, seven days without eating veal parm."
47:34;47:40;"It's part of my culture, but I made a decision."
47:40;47:42;"Veal is the harshest."
47:42;47:43;"Veal is so harsh."
47:43;47:50;"Also, there's something about a veal parm sub that's also the most brutal because it's like"
47:50;47:55;"the meat is so brutal and then you put it apart and you just throw it on a sandwich for lunch."
47:55;47:56;"Like two in the afternoon."
47:56;48:00;"So maybe her point is, you're right, guys, some of my motives weren't that pure,"
48:00;48:02;"but one of my motives was pure."
48:02;48:07;"And that was knowing that I'm an influential person and I could eat veal parm all day."
48:07;48:13;"But if I use my influence to convince even three percent of my fan base to go vegan,"
48:13;48:16;"I've decreased meat consumption in such a big way."
48:16;48:19;"And I have to live with the guilt when I'm chowing down on that veal parm"
48:20;48:21;"during the break at my show."
48:21;48:22;"Do I feel like an hypocrite?"
48:22;48:23;"The answer is yes."
48:23;48:24;"And I don't feel good about that."
48:24;48:29;"But I am helping decrease meat consumption by masquerading as a vegan."
48:29;48:32;"And yeah, my wires got crossed with this whole Starbucks thing."
48:32;48:35;"As I previously said, I am not actually a vegan,"
48:35;48:38;"but I'm going to continue to pretend to be a vegan because that's my form of advocacy."
48:38;48:39;"I love it, man."
48:39;48:40;"Is there anything wrong with that?"
48:40;48:42;"Winter, what's your take?"
48:42;48:43;"Oh, my God."
48:43;48:44;"I think she'd be crucified."
48:44;48:48;"Ezra, you are you are a brilliant, brilliant songwriter."
48:48;48:52;"You are amazingly talented, but I'm not sure that working at the PR department"
48:52;48:54;"can work out for you."
48:54;48:56;"If that's the advice you're giving."
48:56;48:57;"OK, but hold on."
48:57;48:58;"I'm not done, Winter."
48:58;49:01;"And then she drops a trap banger called veal parm."
49:01;49:06;"You know, I pay off some of my paparazzi contacts and we get a little sneak peek."
49:06;49:07;"Oh, what's this?"
49:07;49:09;"Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson back together?"
49:09;49:12;"They got spotted eating a veal parm at a deli in New Jersey."
49:12;49:15;"Dude, also, she's buying that veal cutlet at the deli."
49:15;49:17;"Uh-huh."
49:17;49:19;"Throwing it on that small charcoal grill."
49:19;49:23;"You got me some type of way."
49:23;49:26;"You choose to feel it this way."
49:26;49:29;"I do not know what to say."
49:29;49:30;"Yeah, yeah."
49:30;49:32;"But you know I shouldn't think about it."
49:32;49:35;"Look at your face."
49:35;49:37;"Now I want to know how you taste."
49:37;49:40;"Usually don't give it away."
49:40;49:41;"Yeah, yeah."
49:41;49:43;"But you know I'm already thinking about it."
49:45;49:49;"Then I realize she's right there."
49:49;49:54;"And I'm at home like damn this ain't fair."
49:54;49:57;"Wake up with your girlfriend."
49:57;50:00;"Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored."
50:00;50:03;"You can hit me in the morning."
50:03;50:06;"Yeah, yeah, like it's yours."
50:06;50:10;"I know it ain't right, but I don't care."
50:13;50:15;"Wake up with your girlfriend."
50:15;50:17;"Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored."
50:17;50:24;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1."
50:24;50:28;"Maybe my PR strategy won't work, but I'm just saying ethically."
50:28;50:29;"Forget about PR."
50:29;50:31;"I agree with Winters, she would get crucified."
50:31;50:34;"But just you as a human being, do you buy the moral argument"
50:34;50:38;"that even though Ariana's, I would call it an addiction"
50:38;50:44;"to veal parm sandwiches, probably results in the murder of,"
50:44;50:47;"I don't know, 100 calves a year?"
50:47;50:54;"That ultimately her influence as a vegan influencer outweighs that."
50:54;50:55;"You know, it's like one of those moral questions."
50:55;51:00;"If you could flip the switch to kill one person or kill five,"
51:00;51:01;"you know, that kind of thing."
51:01;51:04;"Well, as a matter of fact, Ezra, I was a philosophy major"
51:04;51:07;"in college in addition to a computer science major."
51:07;51:10;"So your question really appeals to me."
51:10;51:14;"And I want to say that, yes, the math works out in her favor,"
51:14;51:17;"but unfortunately, that's not the way that people work."
51:17;51:21;"And so the outrage from the hypocrisy"
51:21;51:25;"would probably do more harm overall."
51:25;51:27;"The outrage from the hypocrisy would just muddy the waters"
51:27;51:30;"about what it even means to be a vegan."
51:30;51:32;"And suddenly all these people like to make fun of vegans."
51:32;51:35;"I mean, there's been a lot of hoaxes in the news lately."
51:35;51:36;"Right, I was just thinking about that."
51:36;51:38;"The big college hoax or something."
51:38;51:41;"And honestly, I've been saying for a long time,"
51:41;51:42;"they should just end college."
51:42;51:44;"The whole institution's always been corrupt."
51:44;51:47;"Now it's, you know, it seems even more rotten."
51:47;51:50;"Now suddenly people just lose faith in the institution."
51:50;51:54;"People often say that's what people who believe in Russian collusion."
51:54;51:59;"The only take that I buy is not that the Russians are controlling the US."
51:59;52:01;"It's that maybe they had a pretty good idea"
52:01;52:02;"that if you want to just f*** with the country,"
52:02;52:06;"you just make people lose faith in what's real."
52:06;52:12;"And I guess if a prominent vegan was exposed to be a veal parmesan fraud,"
52:12;52:16;"the outrage and the controversy would make all sorts of non-vegans"
52:16;52:19;"even more adamant about the idea that veganism is just a pose."
52:19;52:22;"And it would move even further away from what it really is,"
52:22;52:23;"which is a kind of moral..."
52:23;52:26;"Well, it's like global warming too."
52:26;52:26;"Right."
52:26;52:30;"If you're like a wealthy advocate for climate change."
52:30;52:30;"DiCaprio."
52:30;52:32;"Right, and you're flying around in a PJ."
52:32;52:33;"Yeah."
52:33;52:35;"People see that as hypocritical."
52:35;52:39;"It's not as extreme as the Ariana Veal fantasy."
52:39;52:41;"This is parody, folks."
52:41;52:43;"Oh yeah, this is a total flight of fancy."
52:43;52:46;"Although it does make me wonder in the real way,"
52:46;52:53;"has Ariana Grande ever eaten a veal parm sub on a PJ?"
52:53;52:55;"Maybe she just played Madison Square Garden"
52:55;53:00;"and one of her assistants ran to Jersey to get a really good veal parm sub"
53:00;53:01;"and they bring it back to her and say,"
53:01;53:04;"""You know, you can eat this on the flight back to Beverly Hills."""
53:04;53:07;"As much as I know there's so many ethical problems with that,"
53:07;53:10;"it does warm the cockles of my heart a little bit"
53:10;53:11;"just to see one of us make it."
53:11;53:13;"We're off the rails here, Wendler."
53:13;53:13;"Sorry, dude."
53:13;53:15;"No, that's fine."
53:15;53:17;"You want to bring it back to Starbucks though?"
53:17;53:19;"Let's bring it back to Starbucks."
53:19;53:22;"So, you know, we've been mostly interested in Howard Schultz"
53:22;53:24;"and Ariana Grande in terms of Starbucks news,"
53:24;53:26;"but we don't have Starbucks Google alerts."
53:26;53:27;"Is there anything else that we're missing?"
53:27;53:30;"What else is going on in the Starbucks universe?"
53:30;53:35;"Well, one big thing is store closures that they announced"
53:35;53:37;"right around the time that I spoke to you last."
53:37;53:40;"They announced they were tripling store closures"
53:40;53:44;"from 50 to 150 for the United States this year"
53:44;53:47;"and I've been tracking that pretty closely."
53:47;53:50;"In fact, I just posted up a list of stores that have closed"
53:50;53:55;"and they're already at 150 and they're still going."
53:55;53:59;"So I think that number is going to be closer to 200."
53:59;54:00;"Stores are dropping like flies."
54:00;54:03;"New York, Manhattan has lost like 10 stores."
54:03;54:07;"So is the Starbucks fleet down in net?"
54:07;54:09;"Like, are they opening more than they're closing"
54:09;54:10;"or are they closing more than they're opening?"
54:10;54:13;"They are opening more than they're closing."
54:13;54:14;"Okay, so it's still going up."
54:14;54:18;"They've opened hundreds of stores in corporate stores"
54:18;54:21;"in the US and Canada in 2018."
54:21;54:24;"That's not even counting international stores."
54:24;54:28;"I think when we spoke originally, they were around 28,000."
54:28;54:29;"I think they're around 30,000 now."
54:29;54:31;"So this is just a reorganization?"
54:31;54:33;"That's like Mickey D's numbers."
54:33;54:35;"They were just too dense in the cities."
54:35;54:38;"So most of the closures have been in cities like Los Angeles,"
54:38;54:42;"Southland, Bay Area, New York City, Chicago."
54:42;54:44;"That makes sense."
54:44;54:45;"I mean, Manhattan's a joke."
54:45;54:48;"It's like Chase Bank and Starbucks, like every other block."
54:48;54:50;"Now they're just going to be packed though."
54:50;54:54;"Back in 2008, a decade ago, during the first purge,"
54:54;54:57;"when they shut down about a thousand stores,"
54:57;55:00;"a lot of those were in remote markets, smaller cities."
55:00;55:04;"This time around, those stores have been relatively unscathed."
55:04;55:06;"It's just the bigger cities that are getting hit."
55:06;55:07;"Makes sense."
55:07;55:09;"Well, we'll definitely be keeping an eye on that."
55:09;55:11;"Well, thanks so much for calling in, Winter."
55:11;55:14;"Gotta have you back in person next time you're in LA,"
55:14;55:16;"and we'll definitely have you call in again soon."
55:16;55:16;"Absolutely."
55:16;55:18;"It is always a pleasure talking to you guys"
55:18;55:20;"and love listening to your show."
55:20;55:21;"All right, thanks, man."
55:21;55:21;"Take care."
55:21;55:22;"Have a good one."
55:22;55:22;"Bye-bye."
55:23;55:27;"Everyone could be here to cry"
55:27;55:36;"As it comes, this greening night"
55:36;55:42;"This beautiful creature must die"
55:42;55:46;"This beautiful creature must die"
55:46;55:50;"A death for no reason"
55:51;55:53;"Death for no reason is murder"
55:53;56:00;"And the flesh you so fantastically fry"
56:00;56:04;"Is not succulent, tasty, or kind"
56:04;56:08;"It's death for no reason"
56:08;56:11;"And death for no reason is murder"
56:11;56:18;"And the cough that you cough with a smile"
56:19;56:21;"Is murder"
56:21;56:28;"And the strife that you forcefully slice"
56:28;56:30;"Is murder"
56:30;56:36;"Do you know how unapologetic"
56:36;56:39;"I guess 'cause on this show now we do gross-out stuff."
56:39;56:42;"We drink Cloud Macchiato's and eat Sour Patch Kids cereal."
56:42;56:44;"Is that SPK cereal still around?"
56:44;56:46;"It's here on the premises?"
56:46;56:46;"Very stale."
56:46;56:48;"I might want to try a bite."
56:49;56:50;"I had a thought the other day where I was like,"
56:50;56:51;"""You know what this would be good for?"
56:51;56:53;"As a topping for ice cream."""
56:53;56:54;"What do you think about that?"
56:54;56:54;"Dark."
56:54;56:59;"I'm not a fan of that concept."
56:59;57:06;"But anyway, we've received a can of the Smartmouth Brewing Company's Saturday Morning Beer,"
57:06;57:12;"which is not officially licensed, but kind of branded as a Lucky Charms-style cereal beer."
57:12;57:16;"It's all Lucky Charms colors and shapes, but it doesn't say Lucky Charms."
57:16;57:19;"It says, and it says, ""Magically Ridiculous"" at the bottom."
57:19;57:23;"So first of all, I gotta say that we're just falling for this stuff hook, line, and sinker."
57:23;57:27;"I mean, I was watching Desus and Mero the other day, and they drank one can of this too."
57:27;57:27;"Oh, really?"
57:27;57:30;"They tried, and I'm just like, ""That's how stuff works these days."""
57:30;57:35;"It's like, I guess it's also similar to when we ate the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
57:35;57:38;"A local company does some kind of stunty thing."
57:38;57:39;"Next thing you know, shock jocks like us."
57:39;57:41;"Yeah, this is the real morning zoo in us."
57:41;57:42;"Yeah."
57:42;57:44;"So guys, crazy story out of Virginia."
57:44;57:46;"Some mad scientists over there."
57:46;57:49;"It's always that thing where it's like, people are like, ""Here's a crazy story."
57:49;57:51;"Somebody's making a blah, blah, blah."""
57:51;57:53;"And it's always like, ""What do they think of next?"""
57:53;57:56;"And it's always like, ""Well, they thought of that so that you would do this piece."""
57:56;57:57;"Audio clickbait."
57:57;57:58;"Anyway."
57:58;57:59;"So where's the brewery out of?"
57:59;58:02;"What is Smart Mouth Brewery?"
58:02;58:03;"Norfolk, Virginia."
58:03;58:06;"♪ Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia ♪"
58:06;58:09;"Vampire Week is playing in Norfolk later this year."
58:09;58:11;"We're working on a cover of Promised Land."
58:11;58:12;"Oh, really?"
58:12;58:15;"It crossed my mind in Norfolk, Virginia to bust out Promised Land,"
58:15;58:16;"but they probably get that all the time."
58:16;58:16;"Right."
58:16;58:19;"Are you guys doing any dead covers?"
58:19;58:21;"I think that'd be a bridge too far."
58:21;58:23;"Maybe one day when the smoke clears."
58:23;58:26;"I mean, we have all these people accusing us of being a jam band now"
58:26;58:28;"just because we dropped a little mixolydian."
58:28;58:32;"Yeah, that was funny on the internet when you dropped Sunflower."
58:32;58:33;"Like, it opened Twitter and it'd be like..."
58:33;58:35;"Oh yeah, there was like a moment that said vampire..."
58:35;58:37;"Yeah, you go to the like trends or whatever."
58:37;58:41;"And it's just like this big picture of you and it's sort of like,"
58:41;58:43;"people are calling Vampire Weekend a jam band."
58:43;58:46;"I mean, it's like, why is this a news item?"
58:46;58:49;"And then it's just like, Jared Kushner, like right underneath it."
58:49;58:49;"Yeah."
58:49;58:51;"I know."
58:51;58:52;"Okay."
58:52;58:54;"I mean, I thought it was kind of funny, but my take is that..."
58:54;58:59;"Well, the funny thing is, is that we stretched a few things out live, you know?"
58:59;58:59;"Right."
58:59;59:01;"Now we've got some more musicians and that's kind of fun."
59:01;59:05;"You can call that a form of jamming, but Sunflower is a funny one"
59:05;59:07;"because the song's like two minutes long."
59:07;59:10;"Yeah, I was thinking it's more like kind of light prog."
59:10;59:11;"That's interesting."
59:11;59:12;"Not really jam."
59:12;59:14;"Well, there's no guitar solo."
59:14;59:16;"Right. It's very like..."
59:16;59:19;"But I think you also got to understand something is that people like us are interested in this"
59:19;59:25;"tasteful palette of the 1970s and the various tributations, if that's a word."
59:25;59:26;"Tributaries."
59:26;59:27;"Tributaries."
59:27;59:29;"The mutations, the tributaries, the tributations."
59:29;59:33;"To a lot of people, it's just kind of like you throw in one flat seventh"
59:33;59:34;"and they're just like jam band."
59:34;59:38;"I don't always want to like comment on stuff in real time, but it..."
59:38;59:41;"Even with Harmony Hall, a lot of people are like, ""This sounds like The Grateful Dead."""
59:41;59:43;"And I was kind of like, ""That opening riff is more like..."""
59:43;59:44;"I don't hear that at all."
59:44;59:47;"I know, but then I also take a step back and I'm like..."
59:47;59:49;"And a lot of people said in a complimentary way."
59:49;59:49;"Sure."
59:49;59:53;"So I also don't want to be like, ""Um, actually, I thought maybe more almonds,"
59:53;59:54;"like the harmonized..."""
59:54;59:58;"I mean, maybe the solo at the end, but it's like palm muted."
59:58;01:00:02;"So it's like, that's not a real Jerry move, but I'm just taking it too literally."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"I know, I know."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"It's more like, ""Sounds like The Dead."""
01:00:04;01:00:05;"I'm like..."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"So on the one hand, it's..."
01:00:06;01:00:06;"Not real..."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Sounds more like The Stones to me."
01:00:08;01:00:13;"Like, the groove, like kind of the piano driven groove of Harmony Hall is super like..."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Exile era."
01:00:14;01:00:19;"Yeah, beggar's banquet era Stones."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"But at the end of the day, it's also I'm kind of like..."
01:00:21;01:00:24;"I think that's why you can't get into this stuff in real time because you also don't"
01:00:24;01:00:28;"want to be like hitting people with actuallys when they're just trying to be like, hear"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"what they hear in music."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"And that's cool too."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"Yeah, that'd be so weak if you were just like..."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"If somebody's just like..."
01:00:34;01:00:37;"Yeah, I've gotten a lot of DMs from people like, ""Loving the new tunes, it takes me back"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"to listening to The Dead."""
01:00:38;01:00:42;"And I was just like, ""Well, you don't know what the f*** you're talking about."""
01:00:42;01:00:45;"Because the truth is, it's not like The Dead and The Stones don't have a lot of shared"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"DNA too."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"None."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"And I know what people mean because of course I love the jam band references."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"I just kind of feel like you can't go too far with it because the true definition of"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"a jam band is live improvisational music."
01:00:59;01:01:02;"Anyway, let's try this Lucky Charms."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh, jeez."
01:01:03;01:01:03;"Bottoms up."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Very perfumey."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"It more or less tastes like a real..."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"It's like an IPA."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Like a regular..."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Yeah, and it is an IPA with marshmallows."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"What does it mean with marshmallows?"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"Are there actual chunks in there?"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"No."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"It's like a little sweeter."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"It's okay."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"It's not terrible."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"It's not shockingly horrendous."
01:01:21;01:01:26;"I would actually say that the Sour Patch Kids cereal is like way harsher than this."
01:01:26;01:01:26;"For sure."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"As I say that though, I do want to get one more handful."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Let me hit that SPK real quick."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"I've been thinking about this."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Sunflower."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Shout out to Smart Mouth Brewery."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"And I'm chasing it with some SPK cereal."
01:01:43;01:01:47;"You know it'd be tight if there was a micro brewery that did a Vampire Weekend brew."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"I've seen this with bands."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Like there's..."
01:01:49;01:01:49;"I know."
01:01:49;01:01:49;"Would it be..."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"I feel like there's so many now."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"There's a Godify Voices beer."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"There's a..."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"There's a Sublime beer I see everywhere in LA now."
01:01:54;01:01:54;"Right."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"There's a Dead beer."
01:01:56;01:01:56;"Right."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"It might just be like a limited..."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"I kind of feel like it's played out in a way."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"But it'd be cool."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"We got to find the right brewery."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Or maybe like a tequila."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"I'm more into the tequila."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"A Vampire Weekend tequila?"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Yeah."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Vampire Weekend beer just doesn't feel quite right."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Like you guys are not a beer band at all."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"What about like..."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"Vampire Weekend branded coffee."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"But I feel like I see that a lot too."
01:02:18;01:02:18;"Yeah."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I think tequila, dude."
01:02:20;01:02:24;"I think tequila because that's the rarefied province of Sammy Hagar, George Clooney."
01:02:24;01:02:28;"I also like the idea that it should be like impossible to get"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"and people start to question if it's real or not."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Very limited edition."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"Very limited."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"What's something that just nobody does?"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"It's like gin."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Actually, that's more on point."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Like a gin and tonic."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Just a fine gin."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"I mean, that's more like old school Vampire Weekend."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Like first album era."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"Yeah, kind of like preppy."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"A branded gin and tonic."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"It'd be super dark."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"What?"
01:02:49;01:02:49;"Water."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"Bottled water."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"That'd be so harsh."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Jaden has a water brand that does..."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"Well, it's like sustainable."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Comes in cardboard."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"Maybe he'd link up for a VW water."
01:03:02;01:03:02;"What about like..."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"Seltzer?"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Mm-hmm."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"Maybe like a food product?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Popcorn and raisins."
01:03:08;01:03:13;"I mean, this is just going full circle to Time Crisis branded Frosted Flakes."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"I don't know why that's so f***ing hard."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"It is a legal and logistical nightmare."
01:03:17;01:03:22;"I've been trying for years to get that off the ground."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"And look what happened."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Now I got to go put out a record."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Got to go tour."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Man, I could have been sitting on Easy Street."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"Just raking in that Frosted Flakes money."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"But my incompetent lawyers could not get the deal done, man."
01:03:37;01:03:42;"Seinfeld, if you're listening, I hope that you figured out some way"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"that we can get this thing popping in Japan."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"We have to call Seinfeld if he's not back next show."
01:03:47;01:03:47;"Oh, definitely."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"We need to check in from Seinfeld."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Okay, one thing that I've been meaning to talk about,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"I want to get into this before the top five."
01:05:50;01:05:54;"This story came out a few weeks ago and I didn't want to let it lie too long."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"But this is a band that we've talked about quite a bit on the show."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"And it's Imagine Dragons."
01:05:58;01:06:02;"And I would like to think that outside of occasionally just being cheeky"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"and calling them imagination dragons,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"just because I did that once by accident and then it became a thing."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"I think we've always been pretty respectful of them."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"I would actually say they've grown on us a lot."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Everybody's on their own trip, you know?"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"So I think everybody who's in a band or something,"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"you probably think that, oh, everybody's making fun of you or something."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"Like Vampire Weekend, we've had our share of haters."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"Sure, I remember."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"And I've occasionally referenced that to somebody and somebody being like,"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"""You guys have had it so good. What are you talking about?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"You're a very well-respected band."""
01:06:29;01:06:30;"Like something like that."
01:06:30;01:06:34;"I'm just like, ""Well, yeah, but the other day I saw somebody on my Instagram"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"and they're just like, 'What are you talking about?'"""
01:06:36;01:06:37;"And look, that goes all different ways."
01:06:37;01:06:41;"So, you know, it's just like any field or just life,"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"everybody's on their own trip."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"Everybody thinks that they're getting uniquely hated on or,"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"you know, we're all in our own feelings more."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"And so, you know, you think about Imagine Dragons or something,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"you're like, ""Oh, they're massive."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Raking in the dough, playing big shows, hit after hit."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Like they're killing it."""
01:06:58;01:06:58;"Tons of fans."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Tons of fans."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Like they're on Easy Street."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I'd rather be Imagine Dragons than me."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Up to a point."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"So anyway, you think about that and then you realize,"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"well, even they're on their own trip and they're kind of thinking,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"you know, all that money and success goes out the window"
01:07:11;01:07:14;"when a mean-spirited comment cuts you to the core."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Same as for me."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Same for anybody at any level."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"So anyway, I was kind of sad to see this."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"A few weeks ago, Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds,"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"who we've shouted out on the show"
01:07:23;01:07:28;"because we know he does advocacy for the LGBT Mormon community"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"because that's a whole complicated thing."
01:07:30;01:07:32;"He was pushed to the edge"
01:07:32;01:07:38;"and he felt the need to like drop a couple long form notes on Instagram."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"This is what he said."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"""For a decade now, I've dealt with critics and other bands"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"saying extremely harsh things about my band."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Not what I would call fair criticism,"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"which I always try my best to receive and learn from,"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"but actual clickbait horse s***."
01:07:50;01:07:54;"Words filled with vile and hate meant to feed humanity's need"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"to laugh at each other's imperfections and fails."""
01:07:57;01:07:58;"So first of all, I know that a lot of people"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"when they hear a musician say something like that,"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"they're like, ""Okay, all right, yeah, you're just mad."""
01:08:03;01:08:04;"But it's really true."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Come on, we all know that there's a difference"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"between fair criticism where somebody's just like,"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"""Honestly, I don't f*** with this."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"Here's where I think it fails."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Here's what I think they're trying to do"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"and it didn't live up to it."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Here's why I think this is better."""
01:08:14;01:08:15;"That stuff can be painful,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"but somebody says like, ""Your song sucks."""
01:08:17;01:08:18;"It's like, ""What are you going to do?"""
01:08:18;01:08:19;"-Yep."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"-That's par for the course."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"But he's totally right that there's something different."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"And Imagine Dragons, I could imagine getting..."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"And I think Vampire Weekend got that in the early days,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"maybe not at the same level."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Not just somebody being like,"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"""Here's what I think sucks about this."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"I don't like the voice. I don't like the..."""
01:08:32;01:08:34;"Where it really becomes so obvious"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"that they're creating a whole spectacle."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"They're performing hatred in this way to be like,"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"""This is the worst thing ever."""
01:08:41;01:08:42;"-Yep. I remember you guys."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"-Oh, yeah. We had some brutal stuff."
01:08:44;01:08:44;"-Yep."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"-And then sometimes you meet these people down the road"

01:08:55;01:08:57;"And I also do have to say,"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"kind of like when I talked to Zach"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"about his kind of..."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"who made fun of Vampire Weekend as Vice Peace,"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"you also have to have sympathy too"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"that it's like writers have it really hard too."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"I'd like to imagine if I was a writer,"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"I wouldn't be like writing clickbait things."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Not that that Zach piece was necessarily that,"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"but you know, just stuff like,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"""Why Imagine Dragons is the worst band of all time."""
01:09:14;01:09:15;"I don't think I'd write that,"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"but the truth is this whole advertising universe,"
01:09:18;01:09:22;"the way that ad dollars are spent on the internet"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"incentivizes people to write like clickable, shareable stuff,"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"even if that means being a little extra or a lot extra."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"So I think he's right to point out"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"that those are two different types of criticism."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"So he says, ""I've always stood silently"

01:10:34;01:10:36;"there's like a bit of hypocrisy."
01:10:36;01:10:40;"There's like a type of person online who,"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"it could be a critic or it could just be somebody"

01:10:50;01:10:51;"with some of that stuff."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"But there's definitely the type of person who probably"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"if somebody made a joke about mental illness or something"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"would be like, ""How dare you?"""

01:13:21;01:13:22;"Very cool."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"So you know, I'm in heaven."
01:13:23;01:13:23;"Yep."
01:13:23;01:13:32;"And I remember at some point, Jeff is sitting there kind of interviewing Larry live, and they have this really funny conversation."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"But it starts out with Jeff saying, ""So Larry, you watch 'Saturday Night Live'?"""
01:13:35;01:13:37;"And he goes, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, sometimes."""
01:13:37;01:13:40;"And he's like, ""Man, did you watch it the other night?"""
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And he's like, ""Yeah, I watched some of it."""
01:13:42;01:13:44;"And he's like, ""Did you see the musical artist?"""
01:13:44;01:13:49;"And then Larry goes on a hilarious bit about how he's never watched any musical artist ever on 'Saturday Night Live.'"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"And Jeff goes, ""What about when you were a writer?"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Weren't you like on set?"""
01:13:51;01:13:53;"He's like, ""Yeah, yeah, I'd always go to the bathroom then or something."""
01:13:53;01:13:58;"But anyway, then Jeff goes, ""Well, okay, you won't believe the band that I saw last weekend."""
01:13:58;01:13:59;"And Larry's like, ""Yeah, what is it?"""
01:13:59;01:14:03;"And he goes, ""It's this English band called the 1975."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"It was the worst thing I ever saw."""
01:14:05;01:14:08;"And Larry's already checked out because he's like, ""Okay, I don't know what you're talking about."""
01:14:08;01:14:12;"And then Jeff goes like, ""This guy was wearing leather pants, such a wannabe rock star."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"It was pathetic."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"He had his shirt off."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"He could barely sing."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"The song was terrible."""
01:14:16;01:14:21;"And he went on this like epic kind of like old man rant about how much the 1975 sucked."
01:14:21;01:14:25;"And just as like an artist who like knows how much it sucks to put yourself out there,"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"which I would like to think a stand-up comedian would know as well,"
01:14:28;01:14:33;"I really came close just on some like artist **** to almost being like, ""Yo, shut up, Jeff."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"Like chill the **** out, man."""
01:14:35;01:14:35;"Yeah."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"You're decades and decades older than these dudes."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Like, whatever."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"Who cares?"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Can't you just be like, ""I didn't get it."""
01:14:41;01:14:45;"And he was just like ranting in front of all these people and he was trying to get like Larry in on the cause."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"And I remember at the time, I didn't even know of 1975."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"I just felt kind of protective of them."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"Because I was like, I just knew that feeling of like,"
01:14:51;01:14:55;"""You're going on this TV show where all sorts of random people are going to watch you and judge you."""
01:14:55;01:14:59;"And I understand a stand-up comedian's job is to also kind of like make fun of ****."
01:14:59;01:15:04;"So maybe I got to chill out a bit because I do admire stand-up comedy as a profession and a medium."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"And then also I could totally picture too,"
01:15:07;01:15:11;"I could just immediately picture myself like young and having just performed on Saturday Night Live."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"And maybe those guys are curb heads."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"I mean, it wouldn't..."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"They probably are."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"It wouldn't be crazy."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"I mean, you know, I know some English people who are curb heads."
01:15:19;01:15:23;"And just imagine like, you're like, ""Oh, I like that show. Oh, it's so funny. Larry David's a legend."""
01:15:23;01:15:24;"Then you're just like, ""Well, you know the other guy, Jeff?"""
01:15:24;01:15:25;"And they're like, ""Yeah."""
01:15:25;01:15:29;"It's like, he talked about how much you **** sucked on Saturday Night Live for 10 minutes"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"in front of Sour Silverman and Larry David."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"And you'd be like, ""Really?"""
01:15:32;01:15:34;"It'd just be kind of brutal."

01:16:35;01:16:36;"Okay, so anyway, back to his note."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"So all these people feel the need to talk badly about my band."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"I don't feel anger towards them, actually."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Just more of a sadness that this industry embraces,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"even celebrates with this mentality."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"I wish it felt like a place where artists stood by each other"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"and supported another."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"Dan, I **** with you, but that's never gonna happen."
01:16:50;01:16:53;"'Cause this industry just pre-selects a lot of nutty people."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"And then even within that crew,"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"sometimes the most competitive, harsh, brutal people"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"end up being the most successful"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"because of those very traits."

01:17:10;01:17:12;"I mean, I'm sure he got a lot of sympathy for this."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"So hopefully it was a cathartic experience."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"But I do think that if he really kept quiet about this"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"for years and years through all their big success,"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"it must've like really got to him at some point,"
01:17:22;01:17:23;"just to feel like he had to write this."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"And the sad part is,"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"I don't think like the dude from Slipknot"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"is gonna read that and be like,"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"""Whoa, sorry, man."""
01:17:30;01:17:30;"- My bad."

01:17:33;01:17:36;"And you're right, it's really hard putting yourself out."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"I think this is gonna be like,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"it's not gonna change anything, but I don't know."
01:17:40;01:17:44;"- Tough to be positive and emotional, but also hip."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"- Right."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"- Those are sort of contradictions."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"- Yeah, unless you're like a pop star."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- 'Cause they're going for like aspirat--"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Yeah, but if they're like a band,"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"they're going for like aspirational."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"- A rock band, yeah."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"- Yeah, like they said, what did he say?"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"He said, ""Strive to bring positivity"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"and empowerment to the world."""
01:17:58;01:17:59;"- That's a hell of a goal."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Well, and I'll say--"
01:18:00;01:18:04;"- It's antithetical to like what most bands try to do."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"So, you know, that's the rub."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"- There is a type of character"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"who exists in the music industry."
01:18:10;01:18:13;"They make music that some people perceive to be corny."
01:18:13;01:18:13;"- Yeah."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"- And they're also really big."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"They can't just be cool with that."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"They're also (beep) and competitive too."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"And that is a very toxic combo."
01:18:19;01:18:22;"So like for instance, there's a version,"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"and I don't get this vibe at all,"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"but there's a version of a guy like Dan"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"from Imagine Dragons, who's in Imagine Dragons,"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"and he knows that people don't think his band's"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"that cool or something."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"And it's maybe antithetical to being hip,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"but the person won't accept that."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"And they're like, ""No, I am hip."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"And actually I'm (beep) cooler than the 1975."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"And actually, (beep) those guys."""
01:18:39;01:18:40;"You know, it'd be like some weird combination."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- That's some Corgan."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"- Right, that's more like--"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- Although he doesn't try to go for empowerment."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"He's just like, ""This is my macro level big rock band,"
01:18:48;01:18:52;"and we're huge, and I'm resentful of those"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"who have much smaller audiences, but."""
01:18:54;01:18:56;"- Right, ""You think you're so much cooler than me,"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Stephen Malkemis?"""
01:18:57;01:19:00;"So there's a version of a Dan Reynolds that's like that,"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"but I don't get the impression that he's like that at all."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"And I think like--"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"- It's kind of a new model."
01:19:04;01:19:08;"Can you imagine some rock star back in the '70s?"
01:19:08;01:19:12;"Like, you know, like Zeppelin or Queen got bashed critically."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"- As we saw in ""Bohemian Rhapsody."""
01:19:14;01:19:16;"- Although I didn't finish the film."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"But those bands had huge audiences,"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"but got bashed critically, and it's just funny"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"to think about Robert Plant being like,"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"""We're just trying to bring positivity."""
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- But we also talked on the show about how like,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"from articles that I've read, Phil Collins--"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- Oh, that's a good one."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"- He's also held this negativity in that he's always"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"kind of like, ""I know I (beep) suck, right?"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"I'm so uncool."""
01:19:36;01:19:37;"- He's a perfect case study."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"- Yeah."
01:19:38;01:19:41;"- I mean, his music in the '80s was so uplifting,"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"and like, I think it's great, but it is kind of corny."
01:19:44;01:19:46;"- Yeah, well, compared to Peter Gabriel, it seemed corny,"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"but these days people probably look back and be like,"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"""Oh yeah, I (beep) all that stuff."""
01:19:50;01:19:51;"- That'd be kind of a weird bottle episode,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"like track Phil Collins' career."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- Oh yeah, I do have Phil Collins' one."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"- Like starting with his Genesis stuff?"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"- Yeah, honestly, that'd be a grail episode"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"if we got Phil Collins on the phone."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"'Cause I've always been so interested in him,"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"ever since I read this Rolling Stone piece,"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"where it seemed like he was this guy"
01:20:06;01:20:09;"had all this success, and it kind of seemed like"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"the haters won in the Phil--"
01:20:10;01:20:11;"- Yeah."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"- And I was like, but that, it's so crazy,"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"because at this moment, all the musicians that I know"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"have at least a few Phil Collins songs"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"that they think are like, incredible."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"- Yeah, it's cycled back around, I think."
01:20:21;01:20:23;"- Like you and I differ on Limp Bizkit."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"You think that's irredeemably bad."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- It's true."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- But I kind of listen back to some of those songs,"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"I'm just like, yo, there's some energy there"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"that seems a little bit fresh in retrospect."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"And I could totally imagine in 20 years,"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"the next generation looking back and making music"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"that semi-ironically, or just in a nostalgic way,"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"has like an Imagine Dragons feel."
01:20:40;01:20:43;"And somebody's like, ""Whoa, you know, back in my day,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"""we thought the 1975 was cooler than Imagine Dragons."""
01:20:45;01:20:46;"They're like, ""Really?"
01:20:46;01:20:47;"""Why?"""
01:20:47;01:20:48;"(laughing)"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"You know, just that (beep) happens."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- Sure, sure."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- Anyway, I hope some of these people reach out."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"I wanna find that out."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"I wanna find out if any of these people reached out."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I mean, I would think at least the 1975"
01:20:58;01:21:01;"and Foster the People being like the kind of younger crew"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"might take pause when they read this and be like,"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"""Oh man, let me clear that up."""
01:21:04;01:21:05;"I would like to think."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"I'm gonna do some research."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I'm gonna hit up my music industry contacts"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"and say, ""Has anybody from the 1975"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"""or Foster the People reached out?"""
01:21:12;01:21:14;"At the very least to say to this dude,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"""Hey man, like, for all I know,"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"""maybe they didn't actually talk (beep)."""
01:21:17;01:21:18;"That can happen too."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"Maybe they made a throwaway comment,"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"- Sure. - And he saw it,"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"and it caught him on a day when he was really struggling"
01:21:23;01:21:26;"with depression or his kid came home from school"
01:21:26;01:21:30;"and was like, ""Daddy, somebody said Imagine Dragons suck."""
01:21:30;01:21:32;"And then he sees a comment, he's like,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"""Well, who knows?"""
01:21:34;01:21:35;"We'll get to the bottom of it,"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"but now let's blast through the top five."
01:21:37;01:21:42;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:42;01:21:45;"- And we're doing something special this week."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"- This is a canned episode."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"- Because this is a canned episode,"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"it's as canned as a Lucky Charms beer."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"- This was taped in mid-October of 2018."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"- This was taped in 2009."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"- This is the first TC ever."
01:21:59;01:21:59;"- Yeah."
01:21:59;01:22:04;"You're listening to the first time crisis recently unearthed."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"We're listening to the top five songs"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"in each of our birth years."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- We've done this before."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Did we do just like--"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"- I think we did another canned episode,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"and we did the 77 versus 84."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"- Okay, so we're doing this week more or less"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"in our respective birth years."
01:22:19;01:22:19;"- Yep."
01:22:19;01:22:24;"- I'm pretty sure 84 is gonna kick 77 in the pants, but--"
01:22:24;01:22:25;"- Well, we'll see."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"- All right."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"- So--"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"- I don't know what's coming, so."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"- Well, Jake, 1977 is off to a strong start."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"At number five, ABBA with ""Dancing Queen."""
01:22:33;01:22:35;"- Oh, geez."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"- Major."
01:22:36;01:22:36;"- Great one."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"- Love those piano octaves."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I mean, this is a stone cold classic."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"- Yeah."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"- I think ABBA was considered deeply uncool"
01:22:48;01:22:49;"in the late '70s."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- For sure."
01:22:52;01:23:15;"- Just imagine like a dude from some totally like,"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"what we'd now consider middle of the road punk band,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"railing against ABBA in 1977,"
01:23:20;01:23:23;"and then like today, just look back and be like,"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"dude, your band sucked."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"- Yeah."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"- You were like a third tier punk band."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"ABBA were like pop geniuses."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"- Cool that you put out one seven inch on stiff records"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"in '77, bud, but."
01:23:34;01:23:38;"- You know that song from MGMT's first album"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"that's like an anecdote, they based the groove off this?"
01:23:40;01:23:44;"♪ I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw, I'm in the ♪"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"It's called--"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"- Like ""Electric Feel""?"
01:23:46;01:23:49;"- No, no, no, it's the other one called,"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"oh, it's called ""Time to Pretend."""
01:23:50;01:23:51;"- Oh yeah."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"- It has like a similar tempo and groove."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"- Wait, so they said that they based it off this?"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"- They based the groove off it."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"Actually, you know what, I want them to hear that"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"back to back."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"- MGMT is a tight band."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"- Oh yeah, MGMT talked some mild (beep)"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"about Vampire Weekend."
01:24:04;01:24:04;"- Did they?"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"- But it was also one of those things--"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- They're tight, I mean like that second record is sweet."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- There's some throwaway comment that at the time"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"I was very sensitive and maybe traumatized"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"by some harsher things, and then when I first met them,"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"I was like, I don't know about these dudes."
01:24:15;01:24:18;"But then they always turned out to be cool."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"And also their record label was very competitive"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"with our record label."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- What label?"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"- They were on Columbia, which we're on now,"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"although, you know, this is 10 years ago."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"So it was a totally different crew."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"- That's funny 'cause you went there."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"- Oh yeah, after all that (beep) talking,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I was like, I wanna see what's going on over here."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"- No, but you also went to Columbia University."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"- Yeah, no, that's what I'm talking about."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"Oh, right."
01:24:35;01:24:35;"- Weird."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"- Columbia Records versus Columbia University."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- What kind of strings did your dad pull?"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"- Yeah."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"- Get you in there, man."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- I played a water polo."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"- Kaiser was a really good rugby player."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"- Yeah, oh yeah, I played."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"There's one picture of me."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"There's one photo."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"- Right."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"- Wait, hold on, this is a G-Song."
01:25:00;01:25:09;"Iconic synth part."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"- This feels way slower."
01:25:13;01:25:23;"- It's got that same kind of (beatboxing)"
01:25:23;01:25:29;"I see the basic idea."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Anyway, the MJMT just had some throwaway comment"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"and some thing, and I just didn't know how to take it."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"And especially because behind the scenes,"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I remember somebody at our label kept telling me"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"how every time they'd see Columbia people,"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"they were hyper competitive."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"And I was kind of like, ""Why, we're on an indie label."""
01:25:42;01:25:44;"- Probably these Ivy League bands."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"- Yeah."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"- Just going in on it, throwing shade."
01:25:48;01:25:48;"- I mean, that's why--"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- 'Cause they're from Wesleyan, right?"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- They went to Wesleyan."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"That's why I'm all for canceling college,"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"'cause it makes the bad worse,"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"and it makes the good bad,"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"especially these types of schools."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"- Perpetuates these class hierarchies, man."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"- It's (beep) up, man."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Anyway."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- Anyway."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"- Anyway, no, I always (beep) with MJMT."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"They're a good bad (beep) with their second album."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"I listened to the new one a little bit,"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"and I was like, ""Damn, these guys, they write songs."""
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- They're doing their thing."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"- They're doing their thing."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"- You heard it here, folks."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"- MJMT, solid group."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"Back to '84."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"So you had Dancing Queen, ABBA, Strong Start."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- Strong Start."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- But I got Eurythmics."
01:26:20;01:26:25;"- So March 24th of '77, I was a month and a half old."
01:26:25;01:26:29;"- March 24th, 1984, I was--"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"- In utero."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"- I was two weeks out."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"I was two weeks out from being born."
01:26:33;01:26:33;"- Okay."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- But I remember this."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"- I was seven."

01:27:54;01:27:56;"So it's before ""Against the Wind."""

01:28:04;01:28:07;"- Down on Main Street."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"No."
01:28:08;01:28:11;"- I wouldn't quite call it a ballad, but it's a mid-tempo."
01:28:11;01:28:15;"- Okay, is it still the same?"

01:34:38;01:34:42;"- That would be amazing if they remade Titanic,"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"but the POV was from Billy Zane."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"- Yeah."

01:35:04;01:35:05;"Was it going to New York or to London?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"- Yeah, it was from like Ireland to--"

01:35:08;01:35:08;"- To New York."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"- And the whole reason that Billy Zane"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"was even on the Titanic is 'cause as soon as he got"
01:35:11;01:35:15;"to New York, he planned on establishing a trust"

01:35:44;01:35:45;"in the first place."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"- He's actually gonna get politics."
01:35:47;01:35:47;"(laughs)"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"- He's gonna be the first socialist for the president"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"of the United States."
01:35:50;01:35:51;"- He was--"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"- Deeply egalitarian."
01:35:52;01:35:56;"- Billy Zane was gonna be the first socialist mayor"
01:35:56;01:35:59;"of New York and then go on to the presidency."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"But this scumbag, Jack Dawson, yeah, maybe."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"- He has to dress the part."
01:36:04;01:36:07;"I mean, he looks like an uptight rich guy,"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"but he's just doing that, he's in character."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"- I know you see me in my tuxedo and tails"
01:36:11;01:36:14;"and you think I'm just another rich guy."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"- He's rich, (beep) this whole thing."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"But listen, you gotta dismantle the system from within."
01:36:19;01:36:23;"And that's why I, Billy Zane, although I am a socialist,"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"will be running on the Democratic Party ticket"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"when I get to New York."
01:36:27;01:36:31;"And now Jack, even though Jack's a working class guy,"
01:36:31;01:36:35;"he's kinda like, ""Well, I make my money picking up crumbs"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"by exploiting these class divisions."""

01:36:40;01:36:42;"that just runs as a Republican."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"- I think it's one of those classic things"
01:36:43;01:36:46;"where it's like the college boy, wealthy guy"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"is actually like super socialist."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"And he's like, ""Well, Jack, surely you understand"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"as a member of the downtrodden working class."""
01:36:52;01:36:54;"And then Jack just says like some crazy racist (beep)"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"and Billy Zane's like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa."""
01:36:56;01:36:58;"You know, look at it through another lens, guys."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"I'm not saying that Billy Zane's necessarily right."

01:54:12;01:54:14;"- Oh, oh wow."
01:54:16;01:54:33;"This is a real nail-biter, this show."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- '84 pulled in the lead."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"- I think you kind of edged it out, though,"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"with the lopper and then this one."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"- Yeah, yeah, I agree."
01:54:40;01:54:43;"- This is such a triumphant end to this top five."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"- I guess we just go out on this, huh?"
01:54:45;01:54:48;"- Yeah, normally we wrap it up and say a few words, but."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- I think we just go out and jump."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"- All right, everybody, take care of each other,"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"believe in yourselves, show a little love"
01:54:54;01:54:57;"to Dan from Imagine Dragons, drop him a nice note."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"That'd be a cool thing for TC heads to do."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Just randomly tweet or leave messages"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"for Dan from Imagine Dragons, like,"
01:55:04;01:55:05;"yo, we (beep) with you, man."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Don't let the haters get you down."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"And we'll be leaving you with ""Jump"" by Van Halen."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"We'll see you in two weeks, TC heads."
