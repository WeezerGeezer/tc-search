00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:05;00:09;"As we enter a new era, we delve into an identity crisis."
00:09;00:16;"But that doesn't last long, as we listen to great music from the Grateful Dead, Queen,"
00:16;00:20;"Poison, and Marvin Gaye."
00:20;00:27;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:27;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:37;00:44;"They were a felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:51;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:09;01:13;"Keep it only there."
01:13;01:16;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:16;01:23;"Alright fellas, we got a crisis emergency. A Time Crisis crisis."
01:23;01:28;"Seinfeld, you want to walk us through this? What's happening with our beloved internet radio show?"
01:28;01:38;"I feel like I should start this off by saying that the Time Crisis remains an internet radio show, but is now available on Apple Podcasts."
01:38;01:54;"My understanding is that this was a decision made by people at Apple Music that they have all this great content, like Time Crisis, Elton John's show, Mark Hoppus's,
all sorts of shows."
01:54;02:02;"And they thought, we can't just have this only available to the people who listen to internet radio, we gotta bring it out to the larger podcast world."
02:02;02:12;"So I think what you have is a classic 80s, 90s indie rock situation where we were out here doing our own thing, internet radio."
02:12;02:22;"And we built something cool, we built a cool cult following, a community, and then a big corporation comes and says, ""Hey guys, we want to take you mainstream."""
02:22;02:30;"What's unusual about this situation is that it's not Warner Brothers trying to poach us from SST Records, it's the same company, man."
02:30;02:34;"It's crazy, man, it's the same company."
02:34;02:41;"It's Apple, came to Apple and said, ""We like what these guys are doing, we want to take it to the big time."""
02:41;02:44;"And Apple said, ""How much are you willing to pay us?"""
02:44;02:48;"And Apple said, ""We'll give you a few..."""
02:48;02:52;"Apple goes to Apple and says, ""Hey, have you ever heard of this show?"""
02:52;03:01;"Actually, I was just reading about this when Nirvana was famously on Sub Pop Records, they put out Bleach on Sub Pop."
03:01;03:11;"And then Geffen came to them and said, ""We want to sign Nirvana,"" and I think Nirvana was ready to take that step to a major label."
03:11;03:24;"And Geffen paid Sub Pop $75,000 to get them out of their contract, but they guaranteed Sub Pop three points on the next two Nirvana albums."
03:24;03:29;"Three points meaning 3% of, I don't know, I guess the list price."
03:29;03:30;"The net or the gross?"
03:30;03:33;"Yeah, that's a good question. Maybe the gross, I don't know."
03:33;03:40;"But, you know, three points, 3% of something might not sound like enough, but 3% of Nevermind, that saved Sub Pop."
03:40;03:43;"And then, of course, Bleach started selling too."
03:43;03:48;"So, apparently Sub Pop was on the verge of going bankrupt right before that all happened."
03:48;03:59;"Yeah, so in this case, I think Apple Podcasts went to Apple Music and said, ""We'll give you $75,000 for TC plus three points on the podcast revenue."""
03:59;04:07;"Let's get these guys out of the backwoods and into the spotlight, into the acid glare of mainstream podcast culture."
04:07;04:15;"We used to have a cool kind of small community of us, Elton, Mark Hoppus."
04:15;04:18;"I mean, I remember St. Vincent still do a show."
04:18;04:19;"I mean, the truth is only-"
04:19;04:20;"Heim Sisters."
04:20;04:24;"Heim Time. I don't think they've done that in a minute."
04:24;04:32;"The only people who've been doing it from the jump at this point without breaks, I believe this is true, is Time Crisis and Elton John's show."
04:32;04:40;"But we had this cool kind of small, culty community based in the small college town of Los Angeles."
04:40;04:48;"And then just us and Elton and the crew making zines, doing internet radio the way we wanted to."
04:48;04:54;"And now they're throwing us out there in the mainstream with the Joe Rogans and the Dax Shepherds and the Office Ladies."
04:54;05:01;"How many TC heads are now going to say, ""I was there back in the day. These guys sold out."""
05:01;05:05;"It definitely changed them."
05:05;05:06;"It went to their heads."
05:06;05:11;"A truly hardcore TC head would be like, ""I've listened to that internet radio show for a long time."""
05:11;05:18;"The truth is a lot of moderate TC heads, if you probably said to them, ""You're that Time Crisis is in the podcast store."""
05:18;05:24;"Some of them might say, ""It wasn't? It's a podcast."""
05:24;05:26;"I mean, I'm sure you guys can relate to it."
05:26;05:32;"I can't tell you how many times over the years people have said they love the podcast, they listen to the podcast."
05:32;05:34;"Heard you got yourself a little podcast."
05:34;05:40;"I even recently had a bio for something that I had to approve."
05:40;05:44;"And it said, ""Ezra Koenig, Vampire Weekend."""
05:44;05:47;"And it said he has a podcast called Time Crisis. I had to correct it."
06:46;06:49;"I wanted to say that I did tweet about this today."
06:49;06:52;"And the response has been very favorable."
06:52;06:57;"People seeming to think that the show will become more accessible and that they can find it more easily."
06:57;07:04;"And so I'm a little worried, like, Jake, how are you going to step outside the house without getting swarmed?"
07:04;07:10;"Like, when I wear my Fox News grandpa shirts to the coffee shops in Highland Park,"
07:10;07:13;"you know, when I'm rocking Breaking News, I don't care."
07:13;07:15;"[laughter]"
07:15;07:21;"At Kumquat in Highland Park on York Boulevard, it's going to be..."
07:21;07:22;"It's Beatlemania."
07:22;07:24;"Yeah, it's going to be tough for me."
07:24;07:28;"But I'm psyched. I feel like this is a new chapter of the show."
07:28;07:30;"And I'm ready to really step it up."
07:30;07:34;"And you know what, guys? I think we got to ditch our kind of..."
07:34;07:36;"We got to stop holding onto the past."
07:36;07:41;"We got to do what a lot of the great independent-minded bands that signed to majors did,"
07:41;07:46;"which, whether you're talking about Nirvana or, you know, Dinosaur Jr. or something,"
07:46;07:51;"we got to say, you know what? Enough with the indies, with this internet radio sanctimony."
07:51;07:53;"We grew up on podcasts, man."
07:53;07:56;"The same way that Kurt or J. Mass could say, you know what?"
07:56;08:00;"I'm sick of this Discord Records sanctimonious pricks."
08:00;08:02;"You know who I grew up listening to, man?"
08:02;08:05;"KISS. Led Zeppelin."
08:05;08:07;"Hey, ever heard of the f***ing Beatles?"
08:07;08:09;"Yeah, they're on Capitol Records."
08:09;08:13;"And I'm sorry if that doesn't pass your little punk rock purity test,"
08:13;08:17;"but I'm actually, like, proud to maybe get my music out to a few more people."
08:17;08:18;"And I think we say the same thing."
08:18;08:20;"We grew up on the podcast app."
08:20;08:24;"Are you kidding me, man? We've taken down hours of content."
08:24;08:27;"I remember Cereal by my cousin."
08:27;08:30;"Not actually. People always ask me that."
08:30;08:33;"That's blood, man. You want me to betray my blood?"
08:33;08:37;"I literally had people in my family breaking, doing podcasts back in the day."
08:37;08:41;"I like in this analogy how Cereal is like the band KISS."
08:41;08:44;"[laughs]"
08:44;08:47;"You show us everything you've got"
08:47;08:50;"You keep on dancing and the room gets hot"
08:50;08:55;"You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy"
08:55;09:00;"You say you wanna go for a spin"
09:00;09:04;"The party's just begun, we'll let you in"
09:04;09:08;"You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy"
09:10;09:14;"You keep on shouting, you keep on shouting"
09:14;09:21;"I wanna rock and roll all night"
09:21;09:24;"And party every day"
09:24;09:28;"I wanna rock and roll all night"
09:28;09:30;"And party every day"
09:30;09:34;"I wanna rock and roll all night"
09:34;09:37;"And party every day"
09:37;09:42;"I wanna rock and roll all night"
09:42;09:44;"And party every day"
09:44;09:47;"And here's one for the real heads. Do you know what the first podcast was?"
09:47;09:49;"Yeah, it was a Grateful Dead song."
09:49;09:52;"So honestly, I don't have time for this, man."
09:52;09:58;"Anybody who doesn't remember, this is true. The first podcast was a Grateful Dead song."
09:58;10:00;"I don't think we need to explain that."
10:00;10:03;"Either you know or you don't know, but the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song."
10:03;10:09;"Do we agree that this is still an internet radio show regardless of the new context?"
10:09;10:13;"Yes, because it's broadcast on Saturday, 3pm Pacific."
10:13;10:22;"Yeah, exactly. And to keep this analogy going, it's kind of like when punk bands sold out"
10:22;10:25;"and then years later, they're getting asked some questions about it."
10:25;10:28;"So you know, there's a lot of controversy back then when you signed to a major."
10:28;10:33;"And they say, ""Well, you know what I gotta say, man?"""
10:33;10:36;"I'm just like picturing some dude from a band who's now like 42."
10:36;10:39;"He's like, ""I gotta tell you, man, we've charted our own course for the last 10 years,"
10:39;10:44;"whether it's in the indie system or on the majors, and we still make the music we want to."
10:44;10:48;"We still put on a kick-ass show. We do what feels right to us."
10:48;10:52;"And honestly, I think that's pretty freaking punk rock. How about that?"""
10:52;10:54;"And I think that's the same energy we need to bring."
10:54;11:01;"Where it's like, we still talk about corporate food history, have a smattering, a light smattering of guests,"
11:01;11:05;"dig into the tasteful palette of the 1970s, compare songs."
11:05;11:08;"And if that's not internet radio, then I don't know what is, man."
11:08;11:11;"Because I don't care where you find it, what we do is internet radio."
11:11;11:15;"It's pure internet radio. I don't care if you download it from the podcast store."
11:15;11:20;"What's the internet radio version of then making like kind of rockabilly country albums?"
11:20;11:26;"Because that's the classic. If you're in a punk band, if you're in like bad religion or whatever,"
11:26;11:30;"now you're 42, you're making your rockabilly country record."
11:30;11:32;"Is that going to be when we go just full health and fitness?"
11:32;11:35;"Okay, yeah. Just like pure bro science."
11:35;11:38;"Yeah. When we become Huberman husbands?"
11:38;11:40;"We start hawking our supplements."
11:40;11:43;"Yeah, exactly. And then it'll be the same thing."
11:43;11:47;"""What? You guys used to do corporate food history and the tasteful palette of 1970s music."
11:47;11:52;"Now you only talk about like what time of day you need to get sunlight in your eyes?"""
11:52;11:55;"I'm just be like, ""Oh my God, you're so basic."""
11:55;11:57;"If you can't see the connection between those things,"
11:57;12:01;"I don't have time to walk you through the entire history of internet radio and podcasting."
12:01;12:07;"All right. But if you don't see the shared roots of those things, man, whatever."
12:07;12:09;"TC Electrolytes."
12:09;12:12;"That sounds kind of good."
12:12;12:20;"But I'll tell you, just as if we're Green Day getting ready to make American Idiot,"
12:20;12:25;"we have to make a commitment to each other right now that we're going to,"
12:25;12:30;"the old school punk rock purists, they may never accept us, but we're here."
12:30;12:33;"And even though we're part of the podcast world now,"
12:33;12:38;"we got to never forget what made us pick up those instruments"
12:38;12:41;"and play those early shows on Gilman Street back in the day."
12:41;12:46;"All right. We got to keep, we'll always stay true to the TC ethos"
12:46;12:50;"and we'll always come back to our core topics."
12:50;12:54;"Always have winter on. That's not going anywhere."
12:54;12:56;"And I don't care if..."
12:56;13:00;"Winter techs always say, ""Sorry, dude. We're a podcast now."""
13:00;13:04;"[Laughter]"
13:04;13:06;"Those guys really changed, man."
13:06;13:08;"You know what? Here's something I've been wanting to do for a while,"
13:08;13:13;"and I think this is very TC, and I think in honor of us both"
13:13;13:17;"expanding our punk rock values into the mainstream,"
13:17;13:19;"taking on the system from within."
13:19;13:21;"[Laughter]"
13:21;13:23;"There's something I've wanted to do for a long time."
13:23;13:26;"Let's do a deep dive on the song ""We Will Rock You."""
13:26;13:27;"Oh, hell yeah."
13:27;13:32;"It's pure time crisis, and yet, maybe because it's such like a regular degular idea,"
13:32;13:34;"it's never felt quite right to throw it in there."
13:34;13:37;"But I just want to dispense with what's on the docket"
13:37;13:42;"and listen to it because not only is it a great song and a fascinating song,"
13:42;13:47;"I feel like I could use some help unpacking it."
13:47;13:49;"What is it all about?"
13:49;13:51;"Because I think there's a few surprises in there, man."
13:51;13:57;"I think it's a little bit more than just a song about winning at sports."
13:57;14:00;"Are we doing ""Champions"" too, or are we just doing ""We Will Rock You""?"
14:00;14:03;"Ooh. I guess they're kind of one. Maybe we do have to do both."
14:03;14:05;"They're kind of one song, right?"
14:05;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:08;"All right. I love this idea."
14:08;14:16;"Wait, play the beginning again."
14:16;14:19;"I love how in the beginning you hear that guy go ""aww."""
14:19;14:21;"It's really quiet in the very beginning."
14:21;14:22;"I didn't hear that."
14:22;14:26;"Wait a minute. Start it again."
14:35;14:36;"Wait, I'm missing it now."
14:36;14:38;"Wait, start it one more time."
14:38;14:40;"Is it right at the top?"
14:40;14:42;"Yeah, it's right at the top."
14:42;14:47;"You hear ""aww."" It's very quiet."
14:47;14:49;"Is it like studio chatter?"
14:49;14:50;"It could be."
14:50;14:53;"The stomps and claps sound great."
14:53;15:01;"You know, one interesting thing about this song, Brian May wrote it."
15:01;15:04;"Hey, look at that. Written by Brian Harold May."
15:04;15:06;"You would think this is classic Freddie Mercury."
15:06;15:17;"All right, pause."
15:17;15:20;"So, okay, this is what got me thinking about this song."
15:20;15:23;"Because, of course, I've been absentmindedly hearing this song my whole life."
15:23;15:24;"Sure."
15:24;15:26;"As I'm sure everybody has."
15:26;15:30;"And, you know, of course, the sentiment ""We will, we will rock you."""
15:30;15:33;"On the one hand, it's like the band saying we're going to rock you."
15:33;15:36;"Like, we're going to perform rock and roll music so well,"
15:36;15:38;"we're going to blow your face off."
15:38;15:42;"But also, it's come to me like, yeah, we're going to destroy you in sports."
15:42;15:43;"We're going to rock you."
15:43;15:45;"Like, we're going to win."
15:45;15:47;"And so, I get..."
15:47;15:48;"Okay, that's not what you thought."
15:48;15:49;"I don't think that..."
15:49;15:52;"I've never heard that used in a sports context."
15:52;15:54;"We're going to crush you."
15:54;15:55;"Matt's a real sports head."
15:55;15:56;"Can you weigh in?"
15:56;15:59;"I just don't think, like, we're going to rock you."
15:59;16:02;"No one says that in a sports context."
16:02;16:03;"No."
16:03;16:04;"Yeah."
16:04;16:05;"No."
16:05;16:06;"Okay."
16:06;16:08;"I do, but I'm also a professional rock musician."
16:08;16:09;"That's true."
16:09;16:11;"You are a music industry professional, so you get a pass."
16:11;16:14;"Well, sometimes if I just jump in and play some pickup basketball"
16:14;16:17;"on the 4th Street courts or something,"
16:17;16:19;"and sometimes I say, ""We will rock you,"""
16:19;16:22;"and then if I sink a three, I'll say, ""I told you I was going to rock you."""
16:22;16:23;"Everybody loves it."
16:23;16:25;"You just walk on the court going,"
16:25;16:29;"just, like, stomping your feet twice, and then solo hand clap."
16:29;16:31;"But it just sounds so small."
16:31;16:34;"Just one guy doing it."
16:34;16:35;"What are you doing, man?"
16:35;16:36;"Something wrong?"
16:36;16:37;"Yeah, we will rock you."
16:37;16:38;"Okay."
16:38;16:40;"Yeah, I know what you mean, Jake."
16:40;16:43;"I guess I mean maybe because I took it in so many years"
16:43;16:46;"after the song was released, I heard it in sports context,"
16:46;16:49;"so I just assumed it was about winning."
16:49;16:50;"Right."
16:50;16:51;"You'd hear it at a stadium, you're saying."
16:51;16:53;"Yeah, and so you're right."
16:53;16:55;"I just assumed it was about winning."
16:55;16:56;"You're right."
16:56;16:58;"Nobody would say, ""I'm going to rock you."""
16:58;17:03;"But also, in the first verse, I would always hear that line that was--"
17:03;17:05;"you know, like most songs, you don't make out every word,"
17:05;17:09;"so I just said, ""None of your can all over the place."""
17:09;17:14;"I always assumed that was Freddie Mercury telling the antagonist of the song,"
17:14;17:16;"""I'm going to kick your can all over the place."
17:16;17:20;"I'm going to kick your butt, kick your ass."""
17:20;17:21;"Right?"
17:21;17:22;"That's what I always thought."
17:22;17:25;"I thought this was a song about saying, ""I'm going to, like--"
17:25;17:27;"in some way, I'm going to have a huge impact on you,"
17:27;17:31;"whether it's through the power of rock and roll or defeating you in sports."
17:31;17:33;"I'm going to kick your can all over the place."""
17:33;17:35;"But I was never sure what the first part was."
17:35;17:38;"And so then when I actually looked at the words"
17:38;17:40;"or I heard them more clearly, it got me thinking."
17:40;17:43;"So, the first verse goes, ""Buddy, you're a boy."
17:43;17:47;"Make a big noise, playing in the street, going to be a big man someday."
17:47;17:50;"You got mud on your face, you big disgrace,"
17:50;17:56;"kicking your can all over the place, singing, 'We will, we will rock you.'"""
17:56;18:00;"And I realized, oh, he's talking about a child who's--"
18:00;18:03;"Who's going to be a big man someday."
18:03;18:05;"And the kid's just kicking a can."
18:05;18:07;"It's like a kid from the '30s."
18:07;18:09;"He's literally kicking a can."
18:09;18:12;"He's literally kicking a can, like, ""Oh, kicking your can down the road."""
18:12;18:14;"Just like a kid without a lot of toys."
18:14;18:15;"Uh-huh, sure."
18:15;18:17;"Maybe Freddie Mercury's talking to himself,"
18:17;18:20;"though Brian May wrote this."
18:20;18:25;"But he's talking about a child who's going to be a big man someday,"
18:25;18:28;"but now maybe he's, like, poor."
18:28;18:30;"He's got mud on his face."
18:30;18:32;"Normally, if you saw a kid got a little mud on their face playing outside,"
18:32;18:34;"you wouldn't call them a big disgrace."
18:34;18:38;"But clearly, there's some, like, deeper emotion here."
18:38;18:41;"This is like a nasty little kid, a disgraceful little kid,"
18:41;18:45;"mud on their face, and they're kind of pathetic."
18:45;18:49;"Because kicking a can is a kind of symbol of being pathetic, right?"
18:49;18:51;"Just kicking a can, right?"
18:51;18:52;"Yeah, yeah."
18:52;18:54;"You got nothing else going on."
18:54;18:56;"I think futile anger, do you know what I mean?"
18:56;18:59;"Like, you're just mad, and you're just walking down the street"
18:59;19:00;"and just kick a can."
19:00;19:01;"You got nothing else to do."
19:01;19:03;"Yeah, I'm just kicking a can."
19:03;19:05;"Misplaced anger or something like that, maybe."
19:05;19:08;"And is the kid singing the chorus?"
19:08;19:10;"Well, yeah, that's what I wonder, because he's saying,"
19:10;19:13;"""You're kicking your can all over the place singing 'We Will Rock You.'"""
19:13;19:16;"So I'm imagining it's almost some, like--"
19:16;19:19;"is it some kid in, like, a war zone or something?"
19:19;19:21;"Or just, like, in some, like, kind of brutal--"
19:21;19:24;"I don't know, I'm picturing just, like, the streets of, like,"
19:24;19:28;"a kind of, like, bombed-out English city in the '50s."
19:28;19:32;"This kid, he's got mud on his face, big disgrace,"
19:32;19:34;"and he's just, like, kicking this can, just being like,"
19:34;19:36;"""Ah, we will rock you."""
19:36;19:37;"Like, it's this fantasy."
19:37;19:40;"So he's talking to a kid who's fantasizing about one day"
19:40;19:42;"being a big man who will rock you."
19:42;19:45;"But he's also being kind of dismissive of this kid."
19:45;19:48;"He's like, ""You think you're going to rock anybody?"
19:48;19:49;"Look at yourself."""
19:49;19:50;"I think you're right, too."
19:50;19:53;"This is, like, immediate post-war British landscape."
19:53;19:55;"It's muddy."
19:55;19:57;"The country is, like, rebuilding,"
19:57;20:00;"but it's still pretty thrashed."
20:00;20:02;"There's, like, food rationing."
20:02;20:05;"I'm picturing, like, yeah, just, like, depressing,"
20:05;20:08;"homogenized British housing developments."
20:08;20:11;"Like, you know, real kind of Pink Floyd"
20:11;20:14;"and, like, the Who kind of landscapes."
20:14;20:15;"Totally."
20:15;20:16;"And you always hear from these people--"
20:16;20:19;"even I remember back in the day reading Morrissey's biography,"
20:19;20:21;"and Morrissey's younger than Brian May,"
20:21;20:24;"but he talked about growing up in Manchester in the '60s,"
20:24;20:27;"and he said there were still piles of rubble"
20:27;20:29;"20-plus years after World War II."
20:29;20:31;"So what year was Brian May born?"
20:31;20:32;"Could I get a number crunch?"
20:32;20:34;"I'm going to guess..."
20:34;20:37;"-19... -'46?"
20:37;20:39;"Oh, yeah, '50? Yeah, '50s."
20:39;20:40;"I'm going to guess."
20:40;20:42;"It was 1947."
20:42;20:43;"-Oh. -Wow."
20:43;20:45;"He's my dad's age. Wow, that's crazy."
20:45;20:47;"So he was 30 when this came--"
20:47;20:50;"because this song was released in '77, the year of my birth."
20:50;20:54;"And the year of punk rock. And Kanye."
20:54;20:56;"And Elvis dying. Big year."
20:56;20:57;"Yeah, big year."
20:57;21:00;"Summer of Sam, talking about '77."
21:00;21:03;"So, right, so, okay, so Brian May was born--"
21:03;21:07;"Reggie Jackson did three home runs in the World Series."
21:07;21:09;"'77's a huge year, dude."
21:09;21:11;"-It is massive. -We were in October."
21:11;21:13;"You were born in a huge year."
21:13;21:15;"You made it a huge year."
21:15;21:18;"And, right, so '47, he's born two years after the war."
21:18;21:19;"And where did he grow up?"
21:19;21:26;"Brian May grew up in Hampton Hill, Middlesex, England."
21:26;21:27;"Don't know where that is."
21:27;21:29;"Don't know where-- that sounds like the country."
21:29;21:32;"But regardless, I'm sure he spent some time in cities."
21:32;21:36;"Went into London, went into, I don't know, Birmingham."
21:36;21:37;"Yeah."
21:37;21:41;"A kid born in 1947 in England, a lot of them at least,"
21:41;21:43;"would 100% might have had moments"
21:43;21:46;"where they were literally playing with their friends"
21:46;21:47;"in a bombed-out building."
21:47;21:49;"-Rubble. -For sure."
21:49;21:50;"Shrapnel."
21:50;21:53;"Yeah, they might even come across, like, a grenade"
21:53;21:55;"that didn't go off, something like that."
21:55;21:57;"-Yeah. -Anyway, so, yeah, I'm with you."
21:57;22:00;"There's a kid post-war Britain kicking their can all over the place."
22:00;22:02;"So let's see what happens in verse two."
22:02;22:06;"♪ Buddy, you're a young man, hot man, shining in the street ♪"
22:06;22:08;"♪ Gonna take on the world someday ♪"
22:08;22:11;"♪ You got blood on your face, a big disgrace ♪"
22:11;22:14;"♪ Waving your banner all over the place ♪"
22:14;22:19;"♪ We will, we will rock you ♪"
22:19;22:20;"♪ Sing it now ♪"
22:20;22:25;"♪ We will, we will rock you ♪"
22:25;22:29;"Okay, so obviously in this song, each verse is jumping in age."
22:29;22:32;"He went from being a boy to a young man to an old man."
22:32;22:34;"So in the young man verse,"
22:34;22:37;"♪ Buddy, you're a young man, hard man, shouting in the street ♪"
22:37;22:39;"♪ Gonna take on the world someday ♪"
22:39;22:43;"♪ You got blood on your face, you big disgrace ♪"
22:43;22:46;"♪ Waving your banner all over the place ♪"
22:46;22:47;"So that's interesting."
22:47;22:54;"Like, now I'm picturing some guy either in his teens or 20s,"
22:54;22:57;"you know, the classic angry young man."
22:57;22:59;"He's out there, now he's shouting in the street."
22:59;23:00;"He's not just kicking his can."
23:00;23:02;"And he's also-- he's got more agency now."
23:02;23:04;"He's waving his banner all over the place."
23:04;23:06;"Like, maybe he got involved in a political movement."
23:06;23:11;"Maybe he's just, like, supporting a soccer team or something."
23:11;23:15;"He's a soccer hooligan, or he's, like, a weird fascist?"
23:15;23:16;"Yeah, right."
23:16;23:19;"Which all would make sense in '77 England."
23:19;23:21;"And also, you got blood on your face."
23:21;23:23;"But this is what's interesting to me."
23:23;23:25;"You're still a big disgrace."
23:25;23:27;"In Brian May's eyes, you're still a big disgrace."
23:27;23:31;"If you wondered if this was a song about, like, a kid who had it tough,"
23:31;23:35;"but then, like, took over his own life, certainly not yet."
23:35;23:37;"You're still a big disgrace."
23:37;23:42;"You used to play with cans, and now you probably, like, get in fights."
23:42;23:45;"You probably go get drunk, and then you get in fights."
23:45;23:46;"You got blood on your face."
23:46;23:48;"You're still a big disgrace."
23:48;23:50;"This time, he doesn't say, ""Sing it,"" but he just goes,"
23:50;23:52;"""We will, we will rock you."""
23:52;23:53;"Sing it!"
23:53;23:54;"We will, we will rock you."
23:54;23:58;"So then you almost wonder, is the Brian May, is, like, the narrator"
23:58;24:02;"now telling this dude, ""No, we will rock you""?"
24:02;24:05;"Like, okay, all right, you grew up."
24:05;24:10;"Like, you could kind of see somebody be like, ""Okay, all right, little man."
24:10;24:12;"Oh, I see you're--okay, now you're a hard man."
24:12;24:14;"Okay, you still singing your little song?"
24:14;24:15;"You want to rock me?"
24:15;24:16;"How about I'm going to rock you?"
24:16;24:17;"How about that?"
24:17;24:19;"No, no, you're not going to rock us."
24:19;24:20;"We're going to rock you."""
24:20;24:26;"And then it kind of gives a little bit of, like, street fight, rumble energy."
24:26;24:29;"Because now I'm starting to feel like, does Brian May hate this guy?"
24:29;24:30;"Well, right."
24:30;24:34;"I mean, maybe this is--now I'm thinking that it is the guy."
24:34;24:37;"It is the kid, and then the young man, and then the old man singing,"
24:37;24:39;"""We will rock you, we will rock you."""
24:39;24:43;"But it's like, instead of being a triumphant chorus of, you know,"
24:43;24:48;"""We're going to win the game,"" it's like the oppressed masses who--"
24:48;24:51;"Right, so they want to rock something so bad."
24:51;24:56;"Yeah, it's kind of like a sad, dark--very TC here."
24:56;24:57;"Yeah."
24:57;25:00;"I really never thought about this song lyrically."
25:00;25:01;"But, like--"
25:01;25:05;"Yeah, now I think it's like a really sad, dark anthem of, like,"
25:05;25:08;"people who are frustrated and, like, feel cast out."
25:08;25:10;"And they're just like--"
25:10;25:11;"It's a song for the losers."
25:11;25:13;"Kind of, yeah."
25:13;25:16;"And that actually is interesting that then they--it's always combined with"
25:16;25:18;"""We are the champions"" because that's a song for champions."
25:18;25:20;"But this song is for losers."
25:20;25:23;"And also, Brian May seems like a gentle guy."
25:23;25:25;"He's very intelligent."
25:25;25:27;"He's one of my first celebrities I ever met."
25:27;25:29;"I vaguely remember this story."
25:29;25:30;"Was that at a museum?"
25:30;25:32;"Yeah, at the British Museum."
25:32;25:33;"You just saw him sitting there?"
25:33;25:37;"I saw him waiting outside the bathroom, so I came out of the bathroom."
25:37;25:40;"I can't remember exactly which trip this was."
25:40;25:42;"Was this pre-vampire or post-vampire?"
25:42;25:44;"Oh, yeah, way pre-vampire."
25:44;25:46;"I might have been 14 or maybe I might have been--"
25:46;25:48;"Oh, wow."
25:48;25:50;"I think--maybe I was--yeah, maybe I was a kid."
25:50;25:51;"I don't know."
25:51;25:53;"But I remember at the time thinking--and I was already pretty into music"
25:53;25:57;"and stuff, and my dad had the Road Warrior soundtrack,"
25:57;25:59;"the Mel Gibson film."
25:59;26:02;"And I would sometimes look at that record, which is done by Brian May,"
26:02;26:05;"and I thought that would be a cool thing to lead with, like,"
26:05;26:07;"""Oh, hey, man, I love the Road Warrior soundtrack."""
26:07;26:09;"Thankfully, I didn't do that because later I found out"
26:09;26:11;"that's a different guy named Brian May."
26:11;26:12;"[laughs]"
26:12;26:13;"Oh, man."
26:13;26:14;"Thank God."
26:14;26:16;"I probably would have been so embarrassed and cringed out."
26:16;26:21;"I probably would never have started a band if he had said not me."
26:21;26:24;"And he was--I could tell he probably didn't want to be bothered,"
26:24;26:27;"so I just went and said--like Chris Farley should have stopped."
26:27;26:28;"""Are you Brian May?"""
26:28;26:30;"And he was like, ""Yes."""
26:30;26:32;"And I was like, ""Oh, that's awesome."""
26:32;26:33;"[laughs]"
26:33;26:35;"That was it."
26:35;26:37;"Anyway, back to the song."
26:37;26:39;"Third verse, ""Buddy, You're an Old Man."""
26:39;26:41;"♪ Buddy, you're an old man, poor man ♪"
26:41;26:44;"♪ Bleeding with your eyes, gonna make you zombie someday ♪"
26:44;26:47;"♪ You got mud on your face, big disgrace ♪"
26:47;26:50;"♪ Somebody better put your bag into your place ♪"
26:50;26:51;"All right."
26:51;26:55;"Yeah, I mean, this is crazy when you really look under the hood on this song."
26:55;26:56;"Yeah."
26:56;26:59;"♪ Buddy, you're an old man, poor man ♪"
26:59;27:04;"♪ Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday ♪"
27:04;27:05;"Wow."
27:05;27:07;"♪ You got mud on your face, big disgrace ♪"
27:07;27:09;"♪ Somebody better put your bag into your place ♪"
27:09;27:13;"So he's like an old dude pleading with his eyes."
27:13;27:15;"That's very evocative."
27:15;27:17;"I've never actually heard that in the song."
27:17;27:19;"So it's like a sad eyed--"
27:19;27:21;"A sad eyed--"
27:21;27:22;"Old man."
27:22;27:23;"And he's a poor man."
27:23;27:25;"He didn't make it."
27:25;27:27;"No, it's not working out."
27:27;27:31;"He was the kid in the bombed out alley kicking a can all dirty."
27:31;27:36;"And then he got-- when he finally had a little bit of, you know, energy and muscle as a young man,"
27:36;27:38;"he waved his banner and he got in fights."
27:38;27:40;"But did that go anywhere?"
27:40;27:42;"Did he channel that energy into something productive?"
27:42;27:43;"No."
27:43;27:45;"He's an old poor man pleading with his eyes."
27:45;27:48;"And this line, ""Gonna make you some peace someday."""
27:48;27:52;"I imagine that that's like a guy who-- he's an old man, so time's running out,"
27:52;27:56;"but he's still saying to himself, ""I'm gonna get-- I'll find myself some peace one day."""
27:56;27:58;"But maybe Brian May--"
27:58;28:00;"Or you think that was the narrative?"
28:00;28:01;"I thought it was like--"
28:01;28:02;"I thought Brian May's gonna make you some peace someday."
28:02;28:05;"No, he's gonna find peace like when he's dead."
28:05;28:06;"Oh, right."
28:06;28:07;"That's how I thought of it."
28:07;28:09;"Oh, yeah, even darker."
28:09;28:13;"Right, so he's just pleading with his eyes basically like, ""Lord, kill me."""
28:13;28:18;"And then what does this sad bastard still have on his face?"
28:18;28:19;"Mud."
28:19;28:21;"[laughs]"
28:21;28:24;"Went from mud to blood, back to mud."
28:24;28:25;"Back to mud."
28:25;28:28;"You're hoping by the time this guy's an old guy--"
28:28;28:33;"I mean, even if he never started a band like Queen or got rich or something,"
28:33;28:38;"you would hope that at the very least he might have a few grandchildren"
28:38;28:42;"keep an eye on him, come visit him, sit in a quiet little apartment,"
28:42;28:45;"have a cup of tea, watch the football."
28:45;28:46;"But no, not this guy."
28:46;28:49;"For some reason, he's still got mud on his face."
28:49;28:52;"I don't know if he's still working or he's homeless or--"
28:52;28:54;"Something went wrong."
28:54;28:57;"And then the final line, ""You got mud on your face, big disgrace."
28:57;29:00;"Somebody better put you back into your place."""
29:00;29:05;"It's truly--it's like you tried and you failed, man, from ashes to ashes."
29:05;29:06;"You waved your banner."
29:06;29:08;"You got your ass kicked."
29:08;29:09;"Now you're an old man."
29:09;29:12;"He's basically saying, ""Get back in your place. Game's over."""
29:12;29:14;"I mean, it seems like he's in his place."
29:14;29:15;"He's pleading with his eyes."
29:15;29:18;"He's on death's door, but I get it."
29:18;29:21;"It's like a nice kind of conclusionary line."
29:21;29:23;"Maybe it's kind of like Queen is triumphantly marching"
29:23;29:28;"through this working-class town, and this old man that they knew from childhood"
29:28;29:32;"kind of steps outside with his pleading eyes, mud on his face,"
29:32;29:34;"and he's kind of like, ""Oh, boys,"" and they're just like,"
29:34;29:37;"""Shove him back in the house. Get back in your place."""
29:37;29:39;"We will rock you."
29:39;29:40;"We will rock you."
29:40;29:43;"And then that makes me wonder, too, if it's--"
29:43;29:45;"what does the song really sing?"
29:45;29:52;"Is it about--does Brian May--and Freddie Mercury with his iconic delivery."
29:52;29:54;"He bears some responsibility, too."
29:54;29:57;"I know that the artist's intent doesn't always matter,"
29:57;29:59;"but would you like to know what Brian May meant?"
29:59;30:00;"Ooh, okay."
30:00;30:01;"Now that we've walked through it."
30:01;30:02;"Yes."
30:02;30:03;"Do you want to hear it directly from the horse's mouth?"
30:03;30:08;"Brian May, this is my absolute hatred of the working-class boys"
30:08;30:10;"who picked on me as a child."
30:10;30:14;"It's brought me nothing but joy to see their failed lives."
30:14;30:19;"So this is straight from Brian's brain."
30:19;30:23;"""I have this story in my head about the power of a person as he or she ages."
30:23;30:26;"The three verses would be the three stages of life--childhood, young adulthood,"
30:26;30:29;"and old age."" All right, so we followed so far."
30:29;30:32;"""The first verse was being a kid, wondering if you're going to make"
30:32;30:34;"a mark in the world."
30:34;30:36;"As a young adult, we feel the power we have."
30:36;30:39;"We get angry about things, and we try to change them."
30:39;30:41;"And the last verse is about old age and acceptance."
30:41;30:45;"By then, you have to pick and choose your fights and maximize your effect."
30:45;30:47;"It's the evolution of someone who wants to change the world,"
30:47;30:51;"who never quite gets a handle on his rage but learns to live with it."
30:51;30:56;"It's what you dream of and hope for the frustration you face."
30:56;30:58;"In my songs, there's always an element of irony."
30:58;31:02;"'We will rock you' is a cry full of surety and confidence"
31:02;31:04;"that will rock everything."
31:04;31:08;"But it's also a realization that our power is limited."""
31:08;31:11;"- Whoa. - I think we were pretty much on the money."
31:11;31:13;"We were on the--no, on the money."
31:13;31:16;"His just has more hope, I guess, in the acceptance."
31:16;31:19;"The one thing that Brian maybe has forgot,"
31:19;31:22;"I'm sure whenever he was doing this interview,"
31:22;31:25;"is that he doesn't really resolve it for the dude."
31:25;31:28;"Which, understandably, this is like an aggressive song."
31:28;31:31;"It's an aggressive, minimalist, like, boom, boom, kshh."
31:31;31:33;"- Yeah. - There's no happy ending here."
31:33;31:35;"- So if-- - No, that's what he's--"
31:35;31:37;"but that's what he's saying that's interesting."
31:37;31:39;"It's just how you read it."
31:39;31:42;"He's saying this acceptance, it isn't resolved."
31:42;31:44;"I'm not going to be able to--you're not going to be able to do"
31:44;31:46;"these things that you wanted to do."
31:46;31:51;"You just take--that acceptance you either take as a bummer..."
31:51;31:55;"- Yeah. - Or some kind of maybe relief."
31:55;31:58;"- Well, that--you know what? - Who did we say was Dow?"
31:58;32:00;"Who are we talking about? The Dow of Buffett?"
32:00;32:02;"- We said the Dow of Buffett. - Yes."
32:02;32:04;"That's sort of similar."
32:04;32:07;"No, there is something definitely, I mean,"
32:07;32:09;"that's certainly spiritual in this."
32:09;32:11;"And that is pretty deep, because I didn't even--"
32:11;32:14;"even when I was thinking about it, I mean, I knew it would be more fun"
32:14;32:16;"to talk about it with you guys."
32:16;32:19;"So I only half thought about it when it crossed my mind."
32:19;32:23;"But that ""We Will Rock You"" is about surrender."
32:23;32:25;"- That's deep. - Yes."
32:25;32:27;"Yeah, ""We Will Rock""--because maybe it's like,"
32:27;32:31;"""We Will Rock You,"" but also, you're not going to rock anybody, man."
32:31;32:33;"The universe is going to rock you."

32:37;32:39;"You don't do the rocking."
32:39;32:42;"The universe does the rocking."
32:42;32:45;"And so, yeah, so finally, somebody better put you back into your place,"

33:16;33:19;"Yeah, this tone."
33:19;33:23;"And actually, I guess maybe I judged Brian a little too harshly."
33:23;33:27;"I mean, I admire him immensely, but maybe--"
33:27;33:32;"I was kind of nitpicking by saying he didn't finish the sentiment,"
33:32;33:35;"but actually, he ended the story with his guitar."
33:35;33:41;"With a triumphant, triumphant, soaring guitar piece."
33:41;33:45;"Exactly, and the guitar is kind of what wraps it all up."
33:45;33:49;"The guitar is like that-- brings it all together."
33:49;33:53;"The anger, but also the acceptance, the fighting spirit,"

46:25;46:26;"It was multiple days."
46:26;46:28;"They got stuck on deuce for that long."
46:28;46:29;"Yeah."
46:29;46:30;"Stuck on advantage, whatever."
46:30;46:31;"I'll read you."
46:31;46:38;"By the way, as I look up more specifics about it, because it's famous."
46:38;46:46;"So famous, in fact, that Andy Sandberg made a parody version."
46:46;46:49;"You know how you'll do these parody movies?"
46:49;46:50;"Oh, right."
46:50;46:51;"I remember."
46:51;46:52;"Three Days in Hell."
46:52;46:54;"Yeah, it was a lonely-- Three Days in Hell, which was the--"
46:54;46:55;"Yes."
46:55;46:57;"Yes, which is a parody of it."
46:57;47:01;"I actually saw that, but I don't think I even knew what it was based on at the time."
47:01;47:06;"Okay, so the longest tennis match of all time was famously played between Isner and Mahout."
47:06;47:10;"The first round of the men's singles at the 2010 Wimbledon, Isner eventually won."
47:10;47:17;"It was 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 70-68."
47:17;47:19;"What?"
47:19;47:23;"In a match that lasted for 665 minutes."
47:23;47:25;"Yeah, 11 hours and 5 minutes."
47:25;47:26;"Right."
47:26;47:33;"And just for anybody who doesn't follow tennis, typically the number you might hear at the end might be like 6-4, maybe even 7-5."
47:33;47:42;"No, I'm sure people saw the set before this was Isner 7-6, and people were like, ""Wow, that's really long."""
47:42;47:45;"And then the next one was 70-68."
47:45;47:52;"So that's 70 games Isner won against 68."
47:52;47:54;"Because you've got to win by two."
47:54;48:01;"And they were locked into this for days, and I think they actually changed the rules because of this at Wimbledon."
48:01;48:03;"Now this isn't possible."
48:03;48:05;"And it's also particularly bizarre because..."
48:05;48:07;"There's a new scoring system."
48:07;48:10;"And this wasn't even a final, it wasn't even a quarterfinal."
48:10;48:13;"This was kind of early in the tournament."
48:13;48:15;"So then I was like, ""Yeah, what happened with that game?"""
48:15;48:18;"And then Thomas was like, ""Oh yeah, I read about it."""
48:18;48:22;"So that game was insanely long, and I was like, ""God, it's so stressful."""
48:22;48:23;"That's the feeling I'm talking about."
48:23;48:26;"It's stressful when you're at that end, like high stakes."
48:26;48:30;"""If I get this, okay, but now you're serving, oh God."""
48:30;48:40;"And he was like, ""Well, apparently when that game ended, Mahoud went into the locker room for hours, couldn't speak, was inconsolable."""
48:40;48:50;"And he went into almost like a catatonic state, crying, so much emotion, almost like shell-shocked, like he'd been in a war."
48:50;48:54;"And they're like, ""Come on, man, we got to clear out now."""
48:54;48:56;"And he just couldn't talk to anybody."
48:56;49:03;"And eventually his team dragged him in his clothes into the shower and poured water on him to try to snap him out of it."
49:03;49:06;"And they kind of just carried him out of there."
49:06;49:08;"And he basically had PTSD from it."
49:08;49:13;"And I was just thinking about that, like, I don't know what I thought."
49:13;49:19;"Maybe there's some players who'd be locked into a death match by that, and by the end, they're just kind of delirious and laughing."
49:19;49:24;"But no, this was like, their bodies were probably in fight or flight for three days."
49:24;49:26;"It probably became this psych..."
49:26;49:34;"You also can't work, I mean, just as a casual tennis player, I can tell you that no matter how competitive you are, you're not."
49:34;49:40;"And I consider myself like not, you know, like on the normal side of competitive, like I'm not really crazy about it."
49:40;49:49;"Is that you work your body that hard and you play these points for that long, the idea of them losing, there's no frustration level for it."
49:49;49:54;"It's like, it's not even just your shell shocked, you're like, you put your body through hell."
49:54;50:01;"And then to not advance, to lose after doing that, I think is like, I don't even, yeah, there's like no words for it."
50:01;50:03;"It's like, it's not even just the competitive part."
50:03;50:07;"It's like you did, I mean, can you imagine you three days of work and then you lost?"
50:07;50:08;"It's just..."
50:08;50:15;"And at that point, you probably have a feeling like, well, and you probably feel like, well, that's my career, whether or not it's true."
50:15;50:17;"You're going to be the most famous loser."
50:17;50:18;"Right."
50:18;50:21;"You were the longest death match and you lost."
50:21;50:31;"But one thing got me thinking about is like, even Isner or Eisner, whatever you said, that even the winner is probably shell shocked too."
50:31;50:37;"I guess it just made me think about those guys had basically just been at war in terms of probably how their bodies felt."
50:37;50:41;"Maybe Djokovic never got in those situations because he meditates so much."
50:41;50:46;"He's like, you know, he knows how to just like let it pass through him."
50:46;50:50;"But those guys were probably, it probably felt like squid games to them."
50:50;50:55;"You know, even though the stakes are not as high as life or death, by the end, you probably feel insane."
50:55;50:59;"And I bet even the winner probably went on feeling shocked."
50:59;51:10;"Kind of like when you see like a war movie that kind of keeps it real and like that they win and then they like end with some sort of like uneasy feeling of like the guy gets
home."
51:10;51:12;"And you can tell that he's like all f**ked up."
51:12;51:18;"Like, I won, but like, damn, I'm like, I'm rattled."
51:18;51:19;"At what cost?"
51:20;51:27;"And anyway, I guess it was picturing that match and picturing what those two guys had been through, the winner and the loser."
51:27;51:36;"I guess it also kind of made me, that's what I'm thinking about when I listen to We Are The Champions because it's so, we are the champions."
51:36;51:40;"It has this air of sadness beneath it, which I think is that at what cost?"
51:40;51:45;"Where it's kind of like trying to be brave in the face of struggle."
51:45;51:46;"I've been through hell."
51:46;51:47;"I've paid my dues."
51:47;51:48;"And guess what?"
51:48;51:54;"You're going to keep paying your dues and you're the champion, but also the fight's not over."
51:54;51:56;"And just trying so hard."
51:56;52:05;"The music and the lyrics, the way they work together, it has just such an interesting mix of kind of triumph and failure together."
52:05;52:16;"Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?"
52:16;52:20;"Making smart with their words again?"
52:20;52:25;"Well, I'm bored."
52:25;52:36;"Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killing it, never not chasing a million things I want."
52:36;52:45;"And I am only as young as the minute is full of it, getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought."
52:45;52:48;"But I know they'll never own me."
52:48;52:51;"Baby, be the class clown."
52:51;52:54;"I'll be the beauty queen in tears."
52:54;52:59;"It's a new art form showing people how little we care."
52:59;53:01;"We're so happy."
53:01;53:04;"Even when we're smiling out of fear."
53:04;53:09;"Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like yeah."
53:09;53:16;"I just want to read you what Isner said in an Instagram post commemorating the 10-year anniversary of the match."
53:16;53:23;"Isner wrote, ""It's something that I get asked countless times about, even to this day, and truthfully, don't enjoy rehashing."
53:23;53:25;"What we both went through."
53:25;53:32;"What started as your standard first-round match at a Grand Slam morphed into a spectacle that even stole headlines from the current World Cup."
53:32;53:38;"Afterwards, I learned that on top of his incredible competitive spirit, Diko is one of the most genuine and kind people I've come across."
53:38;53:47;"And it does look like they both sort of celebrate this, but they don't neither, I'm seeing here, enjoy at all reliving it."""
53:47;53:49;"Yeah, it's not funny to them."
53:49;53:54;"It's not like, ""Hey, what's your craziest match you ever played? Oh, you want to hear a wacky one?"
53:54;53:56;"I mean, by the end, we were cracking jokes."""
53:56;54:00;"No, no, it's like, I guess Wimbledon is like too serious."
54:00;54:09;"You know that when the players walk in at Wimbledon, there's a, on the archway, there's a line from a Rudyard Kipling poem,"
54:09;54:17;"the Rudyard Kipling poem, ""If,"" which also gave its name to the nutty but cool Malcolm McDowell movie from the '60s."
54:17;54:24;"And there's a line from that poem says, because that whole poem is, ""If you can do this and you can do that, you'll be a man,"
54:24;54:27;"and you'll inherit the world and you can know how to get through life."""
54:27;54:29;"And some of it's like just some pretty good advice."
54:29;54:36;"If you can, you can hang with the crowd, you can break bread with a king, and you can be the same person no matter where you are."
54:36;54:37;"You know, that's a good thing."
54:37;54:45;"And one of the things that says in that poem is, ""If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same."""
54:45;54:50;"So, it's from the Kipling poem and it says that as you walk into the court on Wimbledon."
54:50;54:51;"Wow."
54:51;54:59;"And that is some weird, I mean, people for, I imagine, good reason have a lot of issues with Kipling as a kind of British imperialist and a racist."
54:59;55:06;"But that doesn't mean he didn't tap in every now and then, tap into the big picture."
55:06;55:12;"And that idea, that triumph and disaster are both imposters and you treat them the same."
55:12;55:18;"I mean, that's very, that's very Dow. That's very Buffett. Very Dowist, very Buffettist."
55:18;55:20;"Very Buffett mindset."
55:20;55:23;"That's that Buffett mindset."
55:23;55:33;"Well, it's like, yeah, don't let the bad times bring you down too hard and don't let the good times go to your head and, you know, give you too big of a self-image."
55:33;55:45;"Exactly. They're both imposters implying that there's something that the real truth of life, of whatever, is something distinct from the ups and the downs."
55:45;55:49;"There's something else that chugs along, whether you're up or you're down."
55:49;55:57;"And I think We Are The Champions kind of embodies that because it's like, there's triumph and disaster in it together."
55:57;56:01;"You know, and it is about, well, what are you going to do? You just keep on keeping on."
56:01;56:03;"We go on and on and on and on."
56:03;56:15;"So it is interesting. These two songs, We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions, like, as much as I used to think they were kind of just like pretty basic, almost like
meathead, kind of just like."
56:15;56:23;"Yeah. I'd always been confused by these songs because I don't think of Queen as like a basic meathead band, obviously."
56:23;56:33;"And I was like, I was almost like, maybe these are like funny, like parodies or something, like deliberate, kind of like deliberately dumbed down kind of anthems."
56:33;56:37;"So I'm glad you brought these to the table because I will never hear these songs the same."
56:37;56:39;"And they are beautiful songs."
56:39;56:40;"Oh my God."
56:40;56:50;"I would like to think that if I was like 14 in 1977, say I was like a member of Pearl Jam, somebody around that age."
56:50;56:51;"Uh huh."
56:51;57:05;"You know, because just like when I was 14 and in real life, I was very psyched about cool music from 1977, whether it's the Sex Pistols or Talking Heads, punk rock, all
that stuff."
57:05;57:13;"But like, I would like to think I would still be able to recognize the artistry of these songs when they dropped."
57:13;57:14;"Yeah."
57:14;57:19;"They're not We Will Rock You or whether it's Margaritaville or Hotel California."
57:19;57:20;"Right."
57:20;57:21;"That's the best."
57:21;57:22;"He went deep on 77 too."
57:22;57:23;"That's crazy."
57:23;57:24;"Wow."
57:24;57:25;"I just remember."
57:25;57:26;"I keep coming back to 77."
57:26;57:27;"Yeah, I forgot that too."
57:27;57:35;"Hey man, if it came out in 77, it's punk rock as far as I'm concerned, whether it's the Eagles or Queen."
57:35;57:38;"And actually, yeah, in terms of the ideas."
57:38;57:40;"The Eagles are playing punk rock, man."
57:40;57:43;"It's just punk rock, man."
57:43;57:48;"The punks, they turned a mirror on American society and so did the Eagles."
57:48;57:52;"And so did Queen, at least maybe not American society, on the human psyche."
57:52;57:54;"Yeah, well, shout out to Queen."
57:54;57:55;"Everybody should check them out."
57:55;57:58;"There's a movie about them called Bohemian Rhapsody."
57:58;57:59;"Good band."
57:59;58:02;"Probably go rent it at Blockbuster if you wanted to."
58:02;58:03;"Yeah."
58:03;58:04;"Thanks, Queen."
58:04;58:07;"And I hope my hoot's doing OK."
58:08;58:13;"Twice upon a time in the Valley of the Tears"
58:13;58:18;"The auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading ears"
58:18;58:24;"And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice"
58:24;58:27;"Anyone for tennis?"
58:27;58:30;"Wouldn't that be nice?"
58:33;58:39;"And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of Bloody Beer"
58:39;58:44;"While the beggars stain the pavements with fluorescent Christmas cheer"
58:44;58:50;"And the Bentley driving guru is putting up his price"
58:50;58:53;"Anyone for tennis?"
58:53;58:56;"Wouldn't that be nice?"
58:56;59:00;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
59:00;59:05;"Wildly changing gears from 1977 to more like '73."
59:05;59:06;"You hear about this, Jake?"
59:06;59:11;"You hear about this Grateful Dead out here releasing demos for the fans to listen to."
59:11;59:13;"You hear about this?"
59:13;59:15;"It crossed my desk thanks to you."
59:15;59:16;"You sent it to me."
59:16;59:20;"You sent me a demo of Here Comes Sunshine,"
59:20;59:23;"which is a song that Richard Pictures has recently started playing."
59:23;59:25;"For the first time ever?"
59:25;59:26;"For the first time ever."
59:26;59:28;"We started playing it this year."
59:28;59:29;"It's a great song."
59:29;59:31;"It's a Wake of the Flood album,"
59:31;59:36;"which I guess in October we're going to hit the 50th anniversary of that record."
59:36;59:39;"Oh, maybe that must be why they're releasing it."
59:39;59:40;"And they released a--"
59:40;59:41;"50th anniversary Wake of the Flood."
59:41;59:42;"Right."
59:42;59:44;"They released a deluxe version of the record,"
59:44;59:50;"and there is a demo of Here Comes Sunshine that Ezra sent over that is cool."
59:50;59:51;"It sounded so interesting."
59:51;59:52;"Why'd you send it over?"
59:52;59:53;"Yeah."
59:53;59:56;"I always liked this song, Here Comes Sunshine."
59:56;01:00:00;"The recorded version is pretty slow, but it's like--"
01:00:00;01:00:04;"the name you could maybe think is like a touch cheesy, Here Comes Sunshine."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"But a lot of the dead songs from this era,"
01:00:06;01:00:12;"there's a few chord changes that have this mystical darkness about them."
01:00:12;01:00:17;"And actually, I think it's right next to the better-known Eyes of the World."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Right before it."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"And I think they share a little bit of vibe in common."
01:00:21;01:00:25;"Well, the main thing I was interested in is they dropped this demo,"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"and I was surprised because it's all the instrumentation"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"playing to a drum machine."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"And I guess that just surprised me."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I'd never heard-- maybe there's other ones I don't know about,"
01:00:34;01:00:38;"but you don't think about the dead and the drum machine."
01:00:38;01:00:44;"And I really like it more than the studio version."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Agreed."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"I mean, it's like lo-fi--"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"it's like Jerry Garcia doing lo-fi bedroom music."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Yeah, exactly."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"And it's something kind of surprising."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"It's very sophisticated, but--"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"well, yeah, let's throw it on."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"This is the Here Comes Sunshine demo."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"[MUSIC - ""HERE COMES SUNSHINE""]"
01:01:27;01:01:33;"Titular moment for the album."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"[MUSIC - ""HERE COMES SUNSHINE""]"
01:01:39;01:02:05;"What is that instrument with all that tremolo?"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Is that a guitar?"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I think it's a guitar."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"[MUSIC - ""HERE COMES SUNSHINE""]"
01:02:11;01:02:27;"Yeah, I love the lo-finess of this."
01:02:27;01:02:32;"You've heard the Jerry Garcia Zabriskie Point recordings, right?"
01:02:32;01:02:33;"Oh, yeah, the soundtrack?"
01:02:33;01:02:38;"Those also have sort of a minimal bedroom, indie rock Jerry"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"kind of feel to it."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"[MUSIC - ""HERE COMES SUNSHINE""]"
01:02:43;01:02:54;"Gives me a little bit of Harry Nilsson."
01:02:54;01:02:57;"Yeah, I can see that."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Well, this is one of Jerry's songs"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"that it kind of reminds me of John Lennon a little bit."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"Yeah, yeah, I can totally see that."
01:03:04;01:03:10;"There's some of his songs that just have real Lennon vibes."
01:03:10;01:03:13;"And this is one of them for sure, and especially this recording."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"[MUSIC - ""HERE COMES SUNSHINE""]"
01:03:16;01:03:21;"Yeah, maybe there's some deadheads out there listening"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"that can direct us to other demos."
01:03:23;01:03:27;"Because I'm not a scholar by any stretch on this."
01:03:27;01:03:34;"I love the idea of a Jerry demo compilation or something."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah, because--"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"If they exist."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"Especially I've heard very little in this middle ground."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Of course, there's a lot of alternate takes,"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"where maybe the early takes before they nailed it."
01:03:45;01:03:50;"And there's acoustic stuff, but this is this funny middle ground."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Yeah."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Somebody should do a drum machine jam band,"
01:03:53;01:03:58;"and walk up with some rhythm master old school drum machine."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"And also, this outro."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"Yeah, this is sick here."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"I love this."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"This reminds me of Kraftwerk."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"Yeah."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And actually, there's a few melodic moments"
01:04:09;01:04:15;"that kind of sound like Audubon, which came out the next year."
01:04:15;01:04:19;"Maybe Kraftwerk, somebody made a tape of this,"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"really inspired them."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Do you know that like, Pol Pol Vuh music"
01:04:23;01:04:27;"that isn't the really ambient Werner Herzog stuff?"

01:04:45;01:04:47;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:04:47;01:04:59;"I mean, the Dead and a lot of the krautrock bands"

01:26:51;01:26:54;"being in a play, you walk over to where they do plays"

01:26:56;01:26:57;"you walk over there."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"So you had a nice degree of autonomy."
01:27:00;01:27:03;"And I was into music, but I wasn't doing"

01:52:48;01:52:52;"Oh, hell no, man, we got done by the hotel detective again."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"- He cuffs him to the bed, puts a boot on the van."
01:52:55;01:52:59;"He cuffs him to the bed, blows the line himself,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"walks out of there."

01:53:04;01:53:06;"- Yeah. - The hotel detective."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"- Bad hotel detective."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"Then he high-fives the busboy."

01:53:25;01:53:27;"He's actually a guy from another band."
01:53:27;01:53:30;"- I want to hear the Grand Funk song about that,"
01:53:30;01:53:33;"about getting busted by the hotel detective."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"- Yeah, it can't always be fun and games."

01:53:38;01:53:41;"where they don't want to party, or the partying goes wrong."
01:53:41;01:53:44;"- That really is one of the dumbest choruses in rock history."

01:53:59;01:54:00;"[laughter]"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"- Because it was number one on the Hot 100."
01:54:02;01:54:06;"- Or were they just offended by the idiocy of it?"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"Especially because they were probably like,"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"""Our lads know how to party."""
01:54:10;01:54:15;"- Apparently, the song was a hit in the UK,"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"reaching number eight on the UK singles chart."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- Okay."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"- And number four in Canada."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- Wow."
