01:19;01:23;"First step of the new year, 22."
01:23;01:23;"Jake, how's it going?"
01:23;01:26;"How's 22 treating you so far?"
01:26;01:28;"♪ 2022 ♪"
01:28;01:31;"♪ I took a big poo ♪"
01:31;01:33;"- Nasty."
01:33;01:34;"- For some reason with that song,"
01:34;01:37;"I always go to straight toilet humor."
01:37;01:39;"- That's usually the easiest place to go with most things."
01:39;01:40;"- Yeah."
01:40;01:43;"♪ 2023 I had to take a pee ♪"
01:43;01:44;"Just dumb, awful."
01:44;01:48;"Like truly like a fourth grader or a four-year-old."
01:48;01:51;"- That's for Jake's side project, Nasty Jake."
01:51;01:54;"- I do toilet humor, weird owl versions"
01:54;01:56;"of Vampire Weekend songs."
01:56;01:57;"- Mountain poos."
01:57;02:00;"(laughing)"
02:00;02:02;"Just like."
02:02;02:04;"- Mountain poos."
02:04;02:07;"- I've always, you know what guys,"
02:07;02:11;"I've just, I've always been a big fan of toilet humor."
02:11;02:14;"I don't have a big outlet for it in Richard Pictures,"
02:14;02:17;"nor my work as a painter, nor Mountain Brews,"
02:17;02:20;"but in Mountain Poos, I can finally, you know,"
02:20;02:22;"get some of that out there."
02:22;02:25;"- Yeah, it's truly bridging my musical life"
02:25;02:27;"and Ezra's musical life into Mountain Poos."
02:27;02:30;"- Yeah, what is Mountain Poos?"
02:30;02:33;"It's a mixture of Vampire Weekend, Mountain Brews,"
02:33;02:36;"and good old fashioned toilet humor."
02:36;02:39;"- Well, I like that if he hadn't had to change the name"
02:39;02:42;"from Dick Fix to Richard Pictures,"
02:42;02:43;"if someone were like, ""What band are you in?"""
02:43;02:45;"Well, I'm in a band, Dick Fix,"
02:45;02:47;"and then I have this other band, Mountain Poos."
02:47;02:48;"- Mountain Poos."
02:49;02:54;"Also, just to be straight up into toilet humor as an adult,"
02:54;02:57;"I mean, here's the thing, almost everybody is."
02:57;03:00;"It's actually more like the rare person you meet"
03:00;03:03;"who's just like, ""I really can't stand toilet humor."""
03:03;03:05;"But very few people, it's a big secret,"
03:05;03:06;"people don't want to admit it,"
03:06;03:09;"but most people actually are into it."
03:09;03:11;"But very few people would actually come out"
03:11;03:13;"and be part of the fan community."
03:13;03:17;"Just to say, if like ever a bunch of,"
03:17;03:19;"Jake, you're at some Hollywood party,"
03:19;03:22;"a bunch of Hannah's cool director friends,"
03:22;03:24;"and people are talking about comedy."
03:24;03:25;"Like, who's made a good comedy lately?"
03:25;03:27;"Who are some of your favorite standups?"
03:27;03:29;"And Jake just buzzes in just like,"
03:29;03:31;"well, me personally, I'm into toilet humor."
03:31;03:35;"So whether it's on the stage, on film, TV show,"
03:35;03:36;"that's what I'm into."
03:36;03:38;"I'm just a toilet humor guy."
03:38;03:39;"- Music parody, you know."
03:39;03:41;"I'm working on my own project, actually, guys."
03:41;03:42;"You wanna hear about it?"
03:42;03:44;"(laughing)"
03:44;03:46;"- Called Mountain Poos."
03:46;03:47;"I mean, you could count,"
03:47;03:52;"I actually, I saw CT over the New Year's holiday,"
03:52;03:55;"and I was singing 2022 had to take a poo to him."
03:55;03:57;"- Oh wait, really?"
03:57;03:59;"You've been workshopping this?"
03:59;03:59;"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
03:59;04:01;"- With various members of Vampire Weekend?"
04:01;04:03;"- Exactly, I'm kind of behind your back a little bit."
04:03;04:06;"I've been working on this for weeks."
04:06;04:09;"But we were saying that you could count up,"
04:09;04:10;"like except for seven,"
04:10;04:13;"you'd have to like kind of slur it, like 20, 27."
04:13;04:15;"But like all of the numbers are one syllable."
04:15;04:16;"So you could keep counting up."
04:16;04:19;"- A Vampire Weekend parody band"
04:19;04:22;"with all the members of Vampire Weekend, except for--"
04:22;04:23;"- Plus Jake."
04:23;04:24;"(laughing)"
04:24;04:26;"- Yeah."
04:26;04:28;"Well, I'm sort of the Robert Hunter of this version."
04:28;04:31;"- Oh yeah, a non-touring member,"
04:31;04:34;"but a primary lyricist and spiritual guide."
04:34;04:35;"No, you're totally right, I could see us."
04:35;04:40;"We'll take 20, 27 off, and then back in 20, 28,"
04:40;04:41;"I was feeling great."
04:41;04:43;"- Yeah, I didn't get as far as eight."
04:43;04:45;"- That's a good, I'm throwing a blank right now."
04:45;04:48;"Anyone, feel free to jump in with some toilet humor."
04:48;04:49;"- My period is late."
04:49;04:52;"(laughing)"
04:52;04:53;"- Okay, period humor."
04:53;04:55;"- Yeah, it's a little, you know."
04:55;04:56;"- Time Crisis 2022,"
04:56;05:00;"we're gonna be doing a lot of the Beatles and toilet humor."
05:00;05:01;"No, we definitely won't return to it."
05:01;05:04;"But I will say, I wouldn't put myself out there"
05:04;05:07;"as somebody who's into toilet humor."
05:07;05:08;"I don't identify that way."
05:08;05:13;"But you know, if I'm honest, it does crack me up often."
05:13;05:18;"And recently, I saw my sister and her boyfriend, Anthony,"
05:18;05:21;"and he's from Indiana."
05:21;05:23;"He's from Noblesville,"
05:23;05:25;"where the Grateful Dead played some legendary shows."
05:25;05:27;"I forget what the venue's called there."
05:27;05:30;"There's like a major amphitheater in Noblesville, Indiana."
05:30;05:33;"- Is it a college town, or what's going on in Noblesville?"
05:33;05:34;"I'm curious."
05:34;05:35;"- I actually learned a lot about this,"
05:35;05:36;"going a little deeper with him."
05:36;05:39;"It's basically greater Indianapolis."
05:39;05:40;"- Okay."
05:40;05:41;"- Like a nice Indianapolis suburb,"
05:41;05:43;"but it's like just outside of,"
05:43;05:45;"it's, you're in Indianapolis, basically."
05:45;05:46;"I didn't realize that."
05:46;05:47;"- Gotcha."
05:47;05:48;"- 'Cause I always pick, whenever I'd read about like,"
05:48;05:50;"yeah, the Dead played Noblesville,"
05:50;05:52;"I always picture you're like out in the middle of nowhere,"
05:52;05:53;"but it's greater Indianapolis."
05:53;05:54;"- Okay."
05:54;05:56;"- But they were telling me about that they have,"
05:56;05:59;"'cause the Vampires is gonna roll in Indianapolis,"
05:59;06:02;"I forget exactly when, this summer, we're doing a festival."
06:02;06:03;"Always have a good time in Indianapolis."
06:03;06:05;"And they said, ""Oh, you gotta,"""
06:05;06:06;"so my sister and her boyfriend were saying,"
06:06;06:09;"""Oh, you gotta try this Italian restaurant."
06:09;06:10;"""It's been there forever."
06:10;06:13;"""It's the oldest Italian restaurant in Indianapolis."
06:13;06:16;"""And actually we know a member of the family"
06:16;06:18;"""and we went to her wedding"
06:18;06:21;"""and the restaurant catered it and it's great."""
06:21;06:24;"And I was like, ""Hell yeah, I'll roll up."""
06:24;06:25;"Actually, last time I was in Indianapolis,"
06:25;06:27;"me and Bayo ate at Buca di Beppo."
06:27;06:30;"If I had known that there was a non-chain"
06:30;06:32;"beloved Italian restaurant, I would have gone there."
06:32;06:34;"So I was like, ""Perfect, I'm there."""
06:34;06:35;"And I said, ""What's it called?"""
06:35;06:39;"And they, ""It's called Iorea's."""
06:39;06:40;"And I said, ""Wait, what?"""
06:40;06:43;"And it just triggered something in my head"
06:43;06:45;"where I said, ""Wait, that's the family's last name?"""
06:45;06:48;"So yeah, the last name of the family is Iorea."
06:48;06:51;"And I said, ""I'm sorry, guys."
06:51;06:52;"""I guess I'm really immature."
06:52;06:52;"""This is making me laugh."
06:52;06:55;"""You guys don't seem to find it funny at all."
06:55;06:55;"""Iorea."""
06:55;06:57;"And they were like, ""Well, I guess here,"""
06:57;06:59;"and they were kind of like,"
06:59;07:01;"""I mean, yeah, we know these people that are great family."
07:01;07:03;"""I'm sure they're a great family."""
07:03;07:03;"And I was like, and they were like,"
07:03;07:06;"""Yeah, probably there was some teasing going on"
07:06;07:08;"""in grammar school if your last name's Iorea."""
07:08;07:09;"And they said, ""But here's the thing."
07:09;07:11;"""When you look at it written out,"
07:11;07:12;"""you don't really think about it."
07:12;07:13;"""So if you're at the restaurant,"
07:13;07:14;"""you're looking at the menu,"
07:14;07:15;"""you're looking at the front,"
07:15;07:18;"""you just see I-A-R-I-A."
07:18;07:21;"""You wouldn't immediately think Iorea."""
07:21;07:23;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I see what you're saying."""
07:23;07:25;"And I'm sure like probably back in the day in Italy,"
07:25;07:28;"a name like that would probably be pronounced what?"
07:28;07:30;"Iaria or something."
07:30;07:31;"- Yeah."
07:31;07:32;"- But anyway, the more I thought about it,"
07:32;07:33;"I was like, ""Well, you know what?"
07:33;07:36;"""That rules that there's a great beloved Italian restaurant"
07:36;07:38;"""called Iaria's."
07:38;07:40;"""Generations of people from Indianapolis"
07:40;07:41;"""have been hitting it."
07:41;07:43;"""Maybe they're not into toilet humor,"
07:43;07:45;"""or maybe it just doesn't register as toilet humor."""
07:45;07:48;"But it created a long discussion."
07:48;07:53;"And I just like really couldn't stop thinking about it."
07:53;07:55;"- I could picture someone who like is not a fan"
07:55;07:57;"of the restaurant or maybe once someone got"
07:57;07:59;"food poisoning there and they were like,"
07:59;08:01;"""Dude, Friday night went to Iaria's."
08:01;08:04;"""I mean, I went to diarrhea's, dude, because."""
08:04;08:05;"- Right, yeah."
08:05;08:06;"- Saturday, I was hurting."
08:06;08:09;"- Yeah, or maybe. - I can just totally picture that."
08:09;08:10;"- Who hates Indiana?"
08:10;08:11;"People from Michigan?"
08:11;08:12;"- Do they?"
08:12;08:15;"- I mean, don't like Pistons fans hate the Pacers?"
08:15;08:17;"Wait, who knows about sports?"
08:17;08:20;"Matt, don't Pistons fans hate the Pacers?"
08:20;08:22;"- They're more bold, but I believe Michigan."
08:22;08:25;"I think Michigan and Indiana, the colleges have a rivalry."
08:25;08:27;"- Oh, maybe the colleges have a rivalry, I don't know."
08:27;08:30;"But somebody who hates Indiana comes into Indianapolis"
08:30;08:32;"to see for an away game for their team."
08:32;08:36;"And then maybe they have something nasty to say about Iaria's."
08:36;08:39;"But anyway, I wanna say I can't wait to eat there."
08:39;08:42;"And I'm into it, but it's just an example"
08:42;08:45;"of how the toilet humor runs deep,"
08:45;08:46;"even if you don't think you're into it"
08:46;08:48;"and that you're thinking about it."
08:48;08:50;"And of course, then I started thinking,"
08:50;08:52;"I don't really know Italian grammar that well,"
08:52;08:57;"but a lot of Italian places are like D apostrophe something."
08:57;08:59;"I don't know if this is proper,"
08:59;09:03;"but like, you know, if it was called like Casa d'Iaria."
09:03;09:05;"I'm not even saying that this is funny,"
09:05;09:07;"but it just, it tickled my phone."
09:07;09:10;"- It would be of Iria, right?"
09:10;09:11;"- Does that make sense?"
09:11;09:12;"- House of Iria."
09:12;09:13;"- Yeah, Nick, you know a little Italian."
09:13;09:14;"Does that make sense?"
09:14;09:16;"Casa d'Iaria?"
09:16;09:20;"Anyway, I'm sure there's some Indianapolis"
09:20;09:22;"Italian food fans are hearing this and saying,"
09:22;09:24;"you guys are insane."
09:24;09:25;"- Yeah, we're asking."
09:25;09:26;"- But also I'm not knocking the restaurant"
09:26;09:28;"and I'm sure it's great."
09:29;09:33;"♪ 2021, what do you think about me ♪"
09:33;09:37;"♪ I could wait a year, but I shouldn't wait three ♪"
09:37;09:42;"♪ I don't wanna be ♪"
09:42;09:45;"♪ 2021, what do you think about us ♪"
09:45;09:50;"♪ Copper goes green, steel beams go rust ♪"
09:50;09:54;"♪ It's a matter of ♪"
09:54;09:55;"This is also apropos of nothing,"
09:55;09:58;"but this was something that I really enjoyed"
09:58;10:00;"being in England last year."
10:00;10:05;"I went with a little crew, Ariel, our boy Ferdy,"
10:05;10:08;"UK music industry legend, took us to a QPR game,"
10:08;10:11;"which randomly I've seen multiple QPR games in my life."
10:11;10:13;"It's the Queens Park Rangers."
10:13;10:15;"They're like, you know how in England"
10:15;10:17;"there's like a million different divisions of soccer?"
10:17;10:19;"And this is like, it's so wild how it's like,"
10:19;10:22;"it's not even the top league, it's like the second league."
10:22;10:24;"And you roll up to like a Friday night game"
10:24;10:27;"in the second league, and there's still 20,000 people there."
10:27;10:29;"You know, there's just like no equivalent."
10:29;10:29;"- Crazy."
10:29;10:30;"- I'm only thinking about this"
10:30;10:32;"'cause I'm thinking about away teams,"
10:32;10:35;"having this like dumb fantasy of the away fan"
10:35;10:37;"coming into Indianapolis to see the game."
10:37;10:40;"And of course it's England, so they do a lot of chants."
10:40;10:43;"QPR is playing Luton, so all the Luton fans,"
10:43;10:44;"which is also greater London,"
10:44;10:47;"they come in to the QPR stadium and you know,"
10:47;10:49;"they roll deep, so this is probably thousands of people"
10:49;10:52;"jump on the train, come in together."
10:52;10:55;"Some people get (beep) face, some people get rowdy,"
10:55;10:57;"some people are just there to watch the game."
10:57;11:00;"But there's a lot of chanting going back and forth."
11:00;11:03;"And I guess this is a thing that exists with a few teams,"
11:03;11:05;"but I just found it so funny and mean"
11:05;11:08;"that when the home team is winning,"
11:08;11:11;"so at QPR, they were winning 2-0."
11:11;11:12;"And towards the end of the match,"
11:12;11:15;"they start this chant that's just to mock"
11:15;11:16;"all the people who came all that way"
11:16;11:18;"just to watch their team lose."
11:18;11:21;"And the chant is, ""2-0 on your big day out."""
11:21;11:23;"And it's kind of to the tune of,"
11:23;11:25;"""Go West by the Pet Shop Boys."""
11:25;11:26;"And they just start chanting,"
11:26;11:27;"thousands of people going,"
11:27;11:32;"""2-0 on your big day out, 2-0 on your big day out."""
11:32;11:34;"I don't know, me and Ariel just like,"
11:34;11:35;"had it stuck in our heads for weeks,"
11:35;11:37;"just, ""2-0 on your big day out."""
11:37;11:38;"'Cause it's just so mean."
11:38;11:42;"It just like cuts so to the core of what's happening."
11:42;11:44;"It's not even just like, ""We're the best, we're beating you."""
11:44;11:47;"It's literally like, ""Hey losers,"
11:47;11:50;"you guys got on the train from your area,"
11:50;11:52;"you came all the way here, it was your big day out."
11:52;11:54;"And what did you get?"
11:54;11:56;"You got 2-0 on your big day out."""
11:56;11:59;"It's like, especially 'cause it probably really"
11:59;12:02;"does hurt people's feelings to have to go get back up."
12:02;12:04;"Your team loses and then you've got to get on the train."
12:04;12:06;"Anyway, that just really stuck with me."
12:06;12:09;"""2-0 on your big day out."""
12:09;12:12;"- It's so condescending, like, ""Oh, your big day."""
12:12;12:13;"- Oh, your big day out."
12:13;12:17;"- Saying that to like adults, like, ""Oh, your big day."""
12:17;12:20;"- It was your big day out."
12:20;12:22;"You and your friends got together."
12:22;12:24;"You bought your train tickets."
12:24;12:25;"Maybe you hired a sitter."
12:25;12:28;"You came together, you were so excited."
12:28;12:30;"You came over to our stadium"
12:30;12:33;"and it was 2-0 on your big day out."
12:33;12:35;"It's like a disappointed child on their birthday."
12:35;12:37;"""2-0 on your big day out."""
12:37;12:39;"And just like all these people chanting it."
12:39;12:42;"- I feel like big day out is a good song title."
12:42;12:43;"- Yeah, totally."
12:43;12:44;"Actually, I did have this."
12:44;12:47;"I wondered, could I incorporate 2-0 on your big day out"
12:47;12:49;"into a song, maybe just big day out."
12:49;12:50;"Just randomly on the next Vampire Weekend album,"
12:50;12:52;"a song called ""Big Day Out."""
12:52;12:53;"So I was like, ""So what's this about?"""
12:53;12:56;"I'm like, ""Well, I want to do a story song."
12:56;12:58;"This is about a Luton fan who took the train"
12:58;13:00;"to a QPR match."
13:00;13:02;"It's about the range of emotions they experienced"
13:02;13:04;"over the course of the day."""
13:04;13:06;"- Also, QPR?"
13:06;13:09;"That's right up there with like crypto.com arena."
13:09;13:12;"- It sounds like QR code."
13:12;13:14;"- Yeah, Qualcomm, QR."
13:14;13:15;"It's just like, ""What? QPR?"""
13:15;13:17;"- They're called the Queens Park Rangers."
13:17;13:18;"I mean, to be fair,"
13:18;13:21;"that name was probably picked 120 years ago."
13:21;13:22;"- Yeah."
13:22;13:24;"- It's an area called Queens Park and they're the Rangers."
13:24;13:26;"- When do you think they started calling it QPR?"
13:26;13:27;"- That's a good question."
13:27;13:29;"- Not before the '90s, maybe the '80s."
13:29;13:32;"No one in like 1920 was like, ""QPR?"""
13:32;13:36;"- I do think that people have been into like initials"
13:36;13:40;"and acronyms in other eras of history."
13:40;13:42;"That's a really good question, but I know what you mean."
13:42;13:45;"It feels very modern just to call something like QPR."
13:45;13:47;"- It's funny to think about some guy"
13:47;13:51;"wearing like a top hat in like 1893,"
13:51;13:55;"being like, ""I'm going to QPR tomorrow."""
13:55;13:57;"- ""I'm gonna go catch the QPR game."""
13:57;13:58;"- ""Gonna get hammered."""
13:58;13:59;"- What the (beep) did he just say?"
13:59;14:00;"Oh, he's a weird dude."
14:00;14:03;"He's really into like just calling things by their initials."
14:03;14:04;"All right."
14:04;14:08;"He's like, ""You watch, it's gonna catch on."""
14:08;14:11;"I'll set my version in the American Midwest"
14:11;14:14;"and it's gonna be about a Michigan sports fan"
14:14;14:17;"who comes to Indiana, has dinner at Irea's"
14:17;14:19;"and watches their team lose."
14:19;14:20;"- There you go."
14:20;14:21;"- This probably happens all the time."
14:21;14:24;"Like people drive to see their team somewhere,"
14:24;14:25;"especially in the US."
14:25;14:28;"Like in the UK, all right, worst case,"
14:28;14:30;"you're jumping on the train for 90 minutes."
14:30;14:33;"But like in the US, I'm sure there's so many people."
14:33;14:34;"I want to do a better job of this."
14:34;14:37;"Give me a fan who would come to Indianapolis"
14:37;14:39;"to see their team play the Pacers."
14:39;14:41;"- The Knicks hit the Pacers."
14:41;14:42;"- The Bucs."
14:42;14:43;"- The Milwaukee Bucs."
14:43;14:45;"- What's the drive from straight up Milwaukee"
14:45;14:47;"to Indianapolis?"
14:47;14:50;"- I'm gonna guess that's five hours."
14:50;14:53;"- Jake, almost, it's four hours and 19 minutes"
14:53;14:55;"if you take the I-65 South."
14:55;14:57;"- Okay, so that's four hours 19."
14:57;15:00;"I'm actually picturing a decent number of Bucs fans"
15:00;15:02;"who are like, ""(beep) it, we can do this."""
15:02;15:05;"I'll go put in a few hours of work in the morning"
15:05;15:07;"and then we're gonna roll out in the afternoon."
15:07;15:11;"Hopefully don't hit some Chicago area rush hour traffic"
15:11;15:12;"on the way there."
15:12;15:14;"We're not paying for a hotel."
15:14;15:18;"We can drive 419 out there, watch the game,"
15:18;15:21;"and be home by two, three a.m."
15:21;15:22;"- Someone's gotta be the DD."
15:22;15:25;"- Somebody has to be the designated driver"
15:25;15:28;"or at least just cram all their beers into the first half."
15:28;15:29;"- First half."
15:29;15:30;"(laughing)"
15:30;15:31;"- All right, we're cutting you off at halftime."
15:31;15:33;"Got it."
15:33;15:33;"I'm the DD."
15:33;15:36;"And so, yeah, somebody would rip out."
15:36;15:38;"I don't know enough about basketball"
15:38;15:41;"to know if this is feasible anytime recently."
15:41;15:44;"They get there and the Pacers just crush the Bucs."
15:44;15:46;"Absolute bloodbath."
15:46;15:47;"Matt Shaking has said-- - I think the Bucs"
15:47;15:48;"are pretty good."
15:48;15:49;"- Yeah, I know."
15:49;15:52;"I had a feeling, as I said, this wasn't that reasonable."
15:52;15:53;"But whatever, this is--"
15:53;15:55;"- They're champions."
15:55;15:56;"- No, I know, they're a great team."
15:56;15:58;"I actually do have a soft spot for the Bucs."
15:58;16:00;"I like people who like the Bucs."
16:00;16:02;"But they get there."
16:02;16:03;"Okay, whatever, this is a story."
16:03;16:04;"This is an alternate universe."
16:04;16:06;"This takes place in the future."
16:06;16:11;"They drive out, watch the Bucs get crushed by the Pacers."
16:11;16:13;"That iorea's tasted great,"
16:13;16:16;"but now with the stank of defeat,"
16:16;16:18;"it's not sitting so well in the stomach."
16:18;16:20;"Everybody piles back into the car"
16:20;16:22;"for four hours and 19 minutes"
16:22;16:27;"of just solemn, depressed driving back."
16:27;16:29;"I mean, what's a basketball score be like?"
16:29;16:30;"- Wait a second."
16:30;16:35;"The Bucs beat the Pacers in December, 114-99."
16:35;16:37;"- Well, that's a victorious drive back."
16:37;16:39;"- Where was that match?"
16:39;16:40;"Was that in Milwaukee?"
16:40;16:42;"- That was in Milwaukee."
16:42;16:44;"(laughing)"
16:44;16:45;"- It's a match."
16:45;16:47;"- Let's go to the basketball match."
16:47;16:49;"Just a real natural thing to say."
16:49;16:51;"(laughing)"
16:51;16:56;"- You're listening to Time Crisis Sports Talk"
16:56;16:58;"on Apple Sports Radio."
16:58;17:00;"- Time Crisis."
17:00;17:01;"- With Ezra Koenig."
17:26;17:29;"- Anyway, all I'm saying is"
17:29;17:31;"there've been a lot of people in America"
17:31;17:33;"who have watched their team get crushed"
17:33;17:36;"and then got into the car for a four and a half hour"
17:36;17:38;"depressed ride back."
17:38;17:42;"Something like 119 to 65 on your big day out."
17:42;17:44;"That's like a really (beep) basketball score, right?"
17:44;17:46;"119 to 65. - That's gnarly."
17:46;17:49;"- 119 to 65 on your big day out."
17:49;17:50;"(laughing)"
17:50;17:52;"Damn."
17:52;17:53;"Go back to Milwaukee."
17:53;17:54;"- Matt's the only sports,"
17:54;17:57;"actual sports fan on this sports talk."
17:57;18:00;"But it is a funny thing to think that if your team loses,"
18:00;18:02;"it was a waste of time."
18:02;18:03;"- Right, you have to be,"
18:03;18:06;"like I'm just picturing some kind of like Zen Luton fan"
18:06;18:08;"at the QPR match."
18:08;18:09;"Two nil on your big day out."
18:09;18:11;"And they're just saying like,"
18:11;18:13;"I can't really express this in like a catchy song,"
18:13;18:17;"but the idea that just because Luton lost two nil"
18:17;18:19;"means that I didn't have a great time with my friends"
18:19;18:21;"and get to watch my favorite team play."
18:21;18:22;"Like what do you got?"
18:22;18:24;"I actually feel sorry for you guys"
18:24;18:26;"that you can only feel happy when you win."
18:26;18:28;"Because yeah, I did have a big day out."
18:28;18:30;"I got on the train with my buddies."
18:30;18:32;"We got to drink great beer,"
18:32;18:35;"ate a sausage roll and supported our boys."
18:35;18:38;"Imagine if we weren't here and they lost two nil."
18:38;18:39;"That would suck for them."
18:39;18:42;"We came to support our guys on a tough day."
18:42;18:43;"Do you guys even know what friendship is?"
18:43;18:45;"I feel sorry for your friends."
18:45;18:47;"If you don't, we're not fair weather fans."
18:47;18:48;"It's all good."
18:48;18:50;"- When I look back on this day,"
18:50;18:53;"a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now,"
18:53;18:55;"I won't think about the score."
18:55;18:58;"I'll think about the companionship and that brew."
18:59;19:01;"- That cold brew."
19:01;19:03;"- Great friends on my big day out."
19:03;19:06;"Two nil, great brews on my big day out."
19:06;19:07;"Two nil."
19:07;19:08;"- All right, it's coming together."
19:08;19:10;"- All right, it's coming together."
19:10;19:11;"It got so stuck in our heads"
19:11;19:14;"that we just like kept singing it in the ride home."
19:14;19:17;"And it was like, we kept almost picturing like a musical"
19:17;19:18;"and this could be part of the musical"
19:18;19:22;"where the guys are chanting two nil on your big day out."
19:22;19:24;"And then it just like cuts to the soloist."
19:24;19:27;"He goes, two nil on my big day out."
19:27;19:30;"And then he becomes like first person."
19:30;19:32;"- It's like Tommy or something."
19:32;19:33;"- Yeah, yeah."
19:33;19:35;"Two nil on my big day out."
19:35;19:38;"Yeah, the lights change, the spotlight comes"
19:38;19:39;"on the young boy."
19:39;19:42;"Two nil on my big day out."
19:42;19:43;"Two nil."
19:43;19:46;"Anyway, we're gonna do a test run, the English version."
19:46;19:49;"And if it works on the West end,"
19:49;19:51;"we're gonna bring it to the Midwest,"
19:51;19:53;"to a theater in Chicago."
19:53;19:55;"And we're gonna do the kind of"
19:55;19:57;"the Milwaukee Indianapolis version."
19:57;20:00;"- Ezra Koenig presents my big day out."
20:00;20:03;"- My big day out."
20:03;20:04;"I mean, it's a four quadrant thing"
20:04;20:06;"because it's musical theater."
20:06;20:11;"Some people like that, sports, other people like that."
20:11;20:12;"It's two quadrant, I guess."
20:12;20:15;"- Yeah, I was gonna say, what are the other two quadrants?"
20:15;20:16;"- Friends and beer."
20:16;20:18;"- There you go, four quadrant."
20:18;20:19;"- There's nobody who doesn't like"
20:19;20:21;"at least one of those four things."
20:21;20:24;"Musical, theater, sports, friends and beer."
20:24;20:25;"- Friends?"
20:25;20:26;"Oh, and toilet humor."
20:26;20:27;"It's five quadrant."
20:27;20:28;"- Sure."
20:28;20:31;"- There's gonna be a lot of toilet humor."
20:31;20:33;"It's gonna be kind of like a book of Mormon"
20:33;20:36;"meets Hamilton meets chariots of fire."

21:27;21:28;"was to get in shape."
21:28;21:32;"- Oh yeah, I mean, I've been thinking about eating better,"
21:32;21:34;"getting in shape throughout last year."
21:34;21:37;"So yeah, I mean, but I think we're all,"
21:37;21:41;"we all share that resolution as a constant sort of desire."
21:41;21:42;"- Absolutely."
21:42;21:43;"You're actually doing something about it."
21:43;21:46;"- Yeah, I'm getting a, I'm getting Hank's fit."
21:46;21:48;"- You actually signed up for something called Hank's Fit,"
21:48;21:52;"which is to train with the controversial Chet Hanks."
21:52;21:56;"- Yeah, you know, I was, it was New Year's Eve."
21:56;21:59;"Chet Hanks, who I follow on Instagram,"
21:59;22:03;"he had posted on his page, you know,"
22:03;22:04;"essentially if you wanna get,"
22:04;22:06;"if you wanna go beast mode like me,"
22:06;22:08;"hit up the link in my bio."
22:08;22:10;"You know, I was like one beer deep."
22:10;22:12;"And so I, you know, on a whim, I sort of just thought,"
22:12;22:14;"well, you know, what's gonna happen?"
22:14;22:17;"And you go to his page and you can fill in your name,"
22:17;22:19;"your email address, and your phone number."
22:19;22:22;"And, you know, this all happened in about a minute."
22:22;22:23;"And I just went on with my life."
22:23;22:25;"I didn't really think about it."
22:25;22:28;"And then a couple days ago,"
22:28;22:30;"must've been about three days ago,"
22:30;22:32;"I get a text that says, ""What's up?"
22:32;22:33;"It's Chet."
22:33;22:35;"Are you ready to boss the (beep) up or what?"""
22:35;22:37;"He's got a way with words."
22:37;22:39;"- It's very motivating."
22:39;22:40;"So I write back immediately,"
22:40;22:42;"""Oh, hell yeah, Chet."
22:42;22:43;"What's the (beep) move?"""
22:43;22:48;"Not long thereafter, I'm part of the Hank's Fit program,"
22:48;22:50;"which is a holistic program that involves"
22:50;22:54;"not just workouts, but nutrition,"
22:54;22:55;"and really a whole new mindset."
22:55;22:57;"And now we're a few days deep"
22:57;23:00;"and I've never felt better in my life."
23:00;23:02;"- And you shared with us some of the workouts"
23:02;23:05;"and I don't wanna, I don't know if we're legally allowed"
23:05;23:06;"to get into all the details of it"
23:06;23:10;"'cause that's probably Chet Hank's proprietary information"
23:10;23:10;"and we can't leak it."
23:10;23:13;"But I personally, and look, I'm no workout expert,"
23:13;23:16;"but I was shocked by the number of burpees he had you doing."
23:16;23:19;"- I mean, I've done personal training before."
23:19;23:21;"And one thing that this brought back to me"
23:21;23:25;"was that there's really no warmup or incline."
23:25;23:27;"You get thrust right into it"
23:27;23:30;"and it becomes a do or die sort of thing."
23:30;23:34;"And so, yeah, I also don't really wanna reveal"
23:34;23:35;"too much of the IP here,"
23:35;23:39;"but we're coming in hot off the top with a lot of burpees."
23:39;23:41;"And I did them and I was sore."
23:41;23:44;"I mean, I think the soreness just wore off today."
23:44;23:47;"I actually had to, 'cause Chet and I,"
23:47;23:49;"we text back and forth through the app"
23:49;23:50;"and I had to say to him,"
23:50;23:53;"hey, I'm gonna have to push this second workout regimen"
23:53;23:54;"a day 'cause I'm still,"
23:54;23:57;"my entire upper body feels like it's on fire."
23:57;23:58;"- What did he say to that?"
23:58;24:01;"- He said, all good, brother, you earned it."
24:01;24:02;"Take a rest."
24:02;24:04;"- Wow, so you're really texting with him."
24:04;24:05;"- Yeah, I mean, it's through an app,"
24:05;24:08;"but he's, I mean, if I need something,"
24:08;24:10;"I reach right out and he's very quick to reply."
24:10;24:13;"- Well, you were concerned that it was a bot."
24:13;24:15;"- Yeah, and I did ask him that."
24:15;24:17;"Yeah, I asked him that straight up."
24:17;24:19;"When I got the text, I said, is this really you?"
24:19;24:22;"Is it a bot or is it a member of your team?"
24:22;24:23;"And he said, no, it's really me, homie."
24:23;24:24;"- Wow."
24:24;24:25;"Well, listen, I think this is great."
24:25;24:26;"And here's the truth."
24:26;24:29;"Chet Hanks, at various points in his life,"
24:29;24:30;"he's been a meme."
24:30;24:33;"He used to do this thing where he would do this,"
24:33;24:35;"apparently, according to some Jamaican people,"
24:35;24:38;"a very impressive patois,"
24:38;24:41;"where he would do a whole thing in patois."
24:41;24:43;"And actually, a friend of the show, Brian Jones,"
24:43;24:45;"used to do perfect lip syncs to them."
24:45;24:48;"And I think Chet Hanks knew he was kinda having some fun"
24:48;24:49;"playing it up."
24:49;24:52;"So in some ways, he kinda made himself into a meme"
24:52;24:54;"or some form of internet humor."
24:54;24:56;"And here's the thing about exercise,"
24:56;24:59;"I think we all know this, whatever gets you moving."
24:59;25:02;"For some people, they need music."
25:02;25:04;"The only thing that's gonna get them on the Peloton"
25:04;25:07;"is a Grateful Dead 50th anniversary"
25:07;25:09;"of American Beauty ride, for instance."
25:09;25:12;"For other people, it needs to be sports."
25:12;25:14;"They love the competition."
25:14;25:16;"So you gotta go play basketball."
25:16;25:17;"It's the only way they're gonna get moving."
25:17;25:20;"And I think for you, as somebody who works"
25:20;25:22;"in the meme coal mines,"
25:22;25:24;"I think the fact that Chet is somebody"
25:24;25:27;"who not only, let us be clear, has an amazing physique."
25:27;25:29;"The last time I saw a picture of him, the guy's ripped."
25:29;25:31;"So you know you can trust him there."
25:31;25:32;"- Yeah, he's jacked."
25:32;25:34;"- And so in addition to being jacked,"
25:34;25:38;"he's also spent some time in kinda the world of memes,"
25:38;25:39;"internet humor, whatever."
25:39;25:41;"So I feel like this is perfect for you."
25:41;25:42;"- Well, thank you."
25:42;25:44;"And I agree, and I will just add to that,"
25:44;25:46;"this may have started as a bit,"
25:46;25:48;"the novelty, oh, let me join."
25:48;25:52;"But I gotta say, I've really crossed the Rubicon here."
25:52;25:55;"I am dead serious about the Hank's Fit lifestyle"
25:55;25:56;"and the mindset."
25:56;25:57;"And I'll give you an example."
25:57;25:59;"I ate plain yogurt for the first time"
25:59;26:00;"in my life the other day."
26:00;26:01;"- Really?"
26:01;26:03;"- Yeah, have you ever had plain yogurt?"
26:03;26:05;"- All the time."
26:05;26:06;"- Oh, really?"
26:06;26:07;"- Was that his rec?"
26:07;26:08;"- Yeah."
26:08;26:09;"- He said he'd plain yogurt?"
26:09;26:11;"You mean just like sour, tangy yogurt?"
26:11;26:14;"- Just like, you know, unsweetened,"
26:14;26:16;"like just the plain variety."
26:16;26:19;"No strawberry, no fruit at the bottom, no blueberry."
26:19;26:20;"- Yeah, so when you say holistic,"
26:20;26:25;"he really is doing, he's got your diet, does he have you?"
26:25;26:25;"- Yeah, yeah."
26:25;26:26;"- Calorie counting or journaling,"
26:26;26:28;"what has he got you doing?"
26:28;26:30;"- Calorie counting, no journaling,"
26:30;26:32;"but there was, you know, he strongly advised"
26:32;26:35;"that I get a food scale, so I copped the food scale."
26:35;26:38;"You know, and then it's just recommended nutrition"
26:38;26:40;"and making sure that you count those calories"
26:40;26:41;"and you get the right balance."
26:41;26:44;"- Wait, a food scale, like literally just like a scale"
26:44;26:46;"that you have in your kitchen to be like,"
26:46;26:48;"put the blueberries on?"
26:48;26:50;"- Yeah, you know, a small scale with a dish"
26:50;26:52;"and the digital timer, I'm sure."
26:52;26:54;"- But like, I don't understand what the point"
26:54;26:55;"of weighing your food is."
26:55;26:57;"- Yeah, you know, honestly, I'm still figuring"
26:57;26:59;"that part out a little bit."
26:59;27:01;"I should probably ask him about it, to be honest with you,"
27:01;27:04;"but you know, you have to follow the number of calories"
27:04;27:07;"based on the weight of each individual ingredient"
27:07;27:11;"and you combine them into, you know, a balanced meal."
27:11;27:14;"- Oh, so somehow like the weight of the food"
27:14;27:16;"corresponds to calorie count?"
27:16;27:17;"- Yeah."
27:17;27:18;"- So you put in like, I see."
27:18;27:20;"- Right, 'cause if you don't weigh it,"
27:20;27:22;"you're not getting an accurate reading of calories"
27:22;27:24;"because if somebody says like,"
27:24;27:26;"""Oh, Jake, what'd you have for breakfast?"""
27:26;27:29;"You know, ""I had some yogurt, I added in some blueberries."""
27:29;27:32;"Well, hold on, did you add in four blueberries?"
27:32;27:33;"Did you add in 12?"
27:33;27:35;"How many grams of blueberries did you add?"
27:35;27:38;"- Right, I feel like blueberries would have no calories,"
27:38;27:39;"but yes, I take your point."
27:39;27:43;"If you add like a handful of granola, now we're talking."
27:43;27:44;"- And is that how you style it?"
27:44;27:45;"Like, are you putting stuff? - Yeah."
27:45;27:46;"- Okay."
27:46;27:49;"- I'll do plain nonfat yogurt, like Greek yogurt,"
27:49;27:51;"and then I'll put a handful of granola in."
27:51;27:52;"- What brand are you doing?"
27:52;27:55;"- Are you still doing Kind granola?"
27:55;27:58;"- I'm all over the place, kind of whatever I see."
27:58;28:00;"I've recently been into this one called Elizabeth,"
28:00;28:01;"I think it's called."
28:01;28:03;"- Oh yeah, Elizabeth is getting big."
28:03;28:04;"- Very, very rich."
28:04;28:05;"I mean, here's the thing,"
28:05;28:07;"you can't go crazy with the granola"
28:07;28:11;"'cause it's very dense and sugar and it's very caloric."
28:11;28:13;"- You have to go, honestly. - You gotta go light."
28:13;28:16;"- You gotta go, and you gotta go sugar-free granola."
28:16;28:18;"You gotta really look at those ingredients."
28:18;28:19;"- Yeah, I don't do that."
28:19;28:23;"I mean, I'm not in the elite mindset coaching program,"
28:23;28:26;"so maybe I should be."
28:26;28:27;"- It's not too late."
28:27;28:30;"- I mean, this could be a real adventure for all of us."

30:02;30:06;"- So he's having you do two workouts a day?"
30:06;30:10;"- No, no, no, it's been two so far"
30:10;30:12;"over the course of four or five days."
30:12;30:13;"- Oh, okay."
30:13;30:14;"- And I was not embracing. - He's not training you"
30:14;30:15;"live on Zoom."
30:15;30:18;"He sends you just like a list?"
30:18;30:19;"- That's right, it's a list."
30:19;30:20;"It's all text-based."
30:20;30:22;"You know, for a higher tier, you know,"
30:22;30:25;"I can get some of that one-on-one motivation in,"
30:25;30:27;"but no, it's just, you know,"
30:27;30:28;"it's sort of like instructions."
30:28;30:32;"It's a list of commands that, you know,"
30:32;30:32;"if you fulfill it,"
30:32;30:35;"then you've locked in your workout for that day,"
30:35;30:36;"but no, no one-to-one,"
30:36;30:39;"but a higher tier will get you those Zoom calls"
30:39;30:40;"with him and his team."
30:40;30:40;"- Okay, but at the very least,"
30:40;30:42;"you know you're gonna be texting with him,"
30:42;30:45;"'cause sometimes we've all probably looked up"
30:45;30:47;"a workout routine on the internet"
30:47;30:49;"and you just see it there in text,"
30:49;30:51;"and you're like, all right,"
30:51;30:52;"says just like do 30 pushups,"
30:52;30:54;"and you look at it and you're like, all right,"
30:54;30:56;"but Chet is holding you accountable"
30:56;30:58;"because he's gonna hit you up and saying like,"
30:58;31:00;"how's it going, did you do it?"
31:00;31:02;"And you'd have to be a real piece of (beep)"
31:02;31:05;"to be not only paying for it, but lying to him."
31:05;31:06;"- Yeah, that's exactly right."
31:06;31:08;"And I gotta say, I gave it a shot last night"
31:08;31:11;"because, you know, it's an intensive workout,"
31:11;31:12;"and it was a lot of different,"
31:12;31:14;"it was the burpees, it was pushups,"
31:14;31:16;"a bunch of different reps and sets."
31:16;31:18;"And I, you know, I tried to do a couple of pushups"
31:18;31:20;"and I swear, it was just, everything was so sore."
31:20;31:22;"And I felt definitely some guilt."
31:22;31:24;"And I, you know, I had to say, look, I gotta confess,"
31:24;31:27;"like, I just couldn't push through it, Chet."
31:27;31:29;"And I was so relieved when I got that text back"
31:29;31:32;"that it's like, you know, that empathy that he understood."
31:32;31:33;"'Cause I laid it out, I said, look,"
31:33;31:37;"I haven't worked out seriously in a long time,"
31:37;31:38;"like a couple of years."
31:38;31:40;"So I think that, yeah, that human connection,"
31:40;31:44;"you know, it'd be like, Jake, like if you had Bob Pollard"
31:44;31:46;"on the other end of an app, I mean,"
31:46;31:48;"I'm sure the fandom is a little bit more intense"
31:48;31:50;"between you and Bob, but like, you know,"
31:50;31:51;"it would feel the same way, right?"
31:51;31:53;"You'd be like, I can't let him down."
31:53;31:55;"- If Bob had a training app."
31:55;31:57;"- Could you imagine Bob Pollard telling you"
31:57;31:59;"to do a hundred burpees?"
31:59;32:00;"I mean, I would do it."
32:00;32:02;"That's the thing."
32:02;32:03;"That's a great analogy, science."
32:03;32:05;"- Wait, should we just start an app"
32:05;32:08;"that's just like a combination of cameo and fitness?"
32:08;32:10;"It probably already exists,"
32:10;32:13;"but it's basically just like your favorite celebrities"
32:13;32:17;"using specially crafted proprietary workouts"
32:17;32:19;"that are gonna hold you accountable."
32:19;32:21;"All right, I copyright this."
32:21;32:22;"I copyright this."
32:22;32:26;"Okay, that legally, it's now property of Time Crisis."
32:26;32:27;"- Done deal."
32:27;32:30;"- Like, who do you want to tell you to do a hundred burpees?"
32:30;32:34;"Because who do you feel like a piece of (beep)"
32:34;32:35;"for lying to?"
32:35;32:36;"It's really what it comes down to."
32:36;32:38;"Who would you be like, I can't lie to you?"
32:38;32:40;"- A lot of people respond to negative incentives."
32:40;32:44;"Imagine if you got somebody's least favorite celebrity."
32:44;32:46;"Imagine a true blue Democrat."
32:46;32:49;"Every time they open their phone,"
32:49;32:54;"former president Donald J. Trump saying, ""You're trash."
32:54;32:56;"""I knew you couldn't do all those burpees."""
32:57;32:59;"Can you imagine how that would motivate somebody?"
32:59;33:02;"And vice versa, some MAGA person."
33:02;33:04;"They got Rachel Maddow."
33:04;33:07;"- Nancy Pelosi sitting there eating ice cream."
33:07;33:08;"Just going."
33:08;33:11;"- That way."
33:11;33:13;"- Nancy Pelosi doing the sarcastic clap."
33:13;33:17;"Oh, you did 45 burpees?"
33:17;33:19;"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
33:19;33:20;"Look at you."
33:20;33:23;"- You're saying it doesn't matter if they're not in shape."
33:23;33:26;"It becomes more of the cult of personality of it all."
33:26;33:28;"- Well, even if they're not in shape,"
33:28;33:30;"but just imagine Donald J. Trump saying,"
33:30;33:32;"""I'm happy with the way that I look."
33:32;33:35;"""My goal was to be president and I accomplished that."
33:35;33:37;"""But look at you, your new year's resolution"
33:37;33:41;"""was to get in shape and you can't even do 47 burpees."
33:41;33:42;"""You're fired."""
33:42;33:45;"(laughing)"
33:45;33:50;"- The nice thing about this sort of parasocial"
33:50;33:54;"personal training journey is that"
33:54;33:57;"Chet is posting his motivational statements"
33:57;34:00;"on his Instagram throughout the journey."
34:00;34:04;"So you'll get little snatches of motivation"
34:04;34:06;"just when you're looking at your phone."
34:06;34:07;"Like I sent Matt,"
34:07;34:09;"Matt, I don't know if you're able to play this,"
34:09;34:10;"but a couple days ago,"
34:10;34:13;"Chet posted something that was very inspiring."
34:13;34:15;"- He's been posting some great vids."
34:15;34:17;"- Yeah, you're a follower too?"
34:17;34:19;"- Oh, I mean, since this whole episode started."
34:19;34:23;"I mean, since your whole journey started a few days ago."
34:23;34:25;"- Right, yeah, the Hank's Fit journey."
34:25;34:27;"- Hey yo, check this out."
34:27;34:30;"When you're in the midst of a transformation,"
34:30;34:31;"a lot of people aren't gonna recognize"
34:31;34:33;"the person you're becoming."
34:33;34:35;"Take that as a good sign and keep moving."
34:35;34:36;"♪ Yeah, let's get it ♪"
34:36;34:39;"- Was he exercising as he said that?"
34:39;34:41;"- This was like clean off a workout."
34:41;34:43;"Like he'd clearly done some reps or some sets"
34:43;34:45;"and he's out of breath."
34:45;34:46;"And he's just laying it down."
34:46;34:49;"Like, people aren't gonna recognize your transformation,"
34:49;34:52;"you know, the whole world is gonna change around you"
34:52;34:53;"and you gotta keep going."
34:53;34:55;"And I, you know, I don't know about you guys,"
34:55;34:58;"but I felt that somewhere deep down."
34:58;35:00;"- Well, and also, you know, this guy,"
35:00;35:02;"from what I know, he's had a somewhat troubled life."
35:02;35:05;"And I think the truth is like,"
35:05;35:07;"you want a trainer who's like been through some (beep)"
35:07;35:10;"who's changed their life, who's turned it around."
35:10;35:11;"Actually, there's a lot of famous workouts"
35:11;35:13;"that are prison workouts."
35:13;35:16;"People who had to, you know, go through all that,"
35:16;35:18;"you know, say what you will, but that's quite a journey."
35:18;35:20;"- I wonder how many clients Chet has."
35:20;35:23;"You have any sense of the scale of the..."
35:23;35:25;"- It's not impossible that you're the only one."
35:25;35:27;"- Let's see, he's got half a million followers."
35:27;35:29;"I thought, you know, there's no world"
35:29;35:31;"where less than 50 people have signed up for this thing."
35:31;35:33;"And I'm reluctant to blow his spot up,"
35:33;35:36;"but I will say that I've been added to a group"
35:36;35:38;"within the app and it's just a few of us in there."
35:38;35:41;"And I have yet to sort of start chatting with people,"
35:41;35:45;"but it's a group, it's a crew, it's a movement."
35:45;35:46;"- And also to be fair to Chet,"
35:46;35:50;"if he's actually interacting with the clients"
35:50;35:54;"in some capacity one-on-one, actually sending you messages,"
35:54;35:56;"that's not like somebody who's trying to, you know,"
35:56;35:58;"start the next Taibo."
35:58;36:00;"That's somebody who wants to build essentially"
36:00;36:03;"a personal fitness business,"
36:03;36:07;"and he doesn't need, you know, a million subscribers."
36:07;36:08;"You know, I mean,"
36:08;36:11;"probably a really popping personal trainer."
36:11;36:13;"How many people can you get to in a week?"
36:13;36:14;"- True."
36:14;36:15;"- 20 at most?"
36:15;36:17;"- Like 20, oof, that sounds like a lot."
36:17;36:20;"- Yeah, actually that might, yeah, well, maybe three."
36:20;36:21;"- Although if you're doing it full-time."
36:21;36:22;"- Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of work."
36:22;36:23;"- Yeah."
36:23;36:25;"- I'm on Twitter and I can at least see"
36:25;36:28;"that there's at least a handful of people"
36:28;36:32;"who are like day 10 of Chet Heng's 60-day challenge,"
36:32;36:34;"just signed up for Heng's Fit."
36:34;36:36;"There's a lot of people that are obviously"
36:36;36:37;"having fun with this"
36:37;36:39;"and that are sort of treating it like a meme,"
36:39;36:42;"but there's at least, we know, I can tell you,"
36:42;36:45;"it doesn't seem like Seinfeld is his only client."
36:45;36:46;"- Okay."
36:46;36:47;"Well, and also I think kind of Seinfeld,"
36:47;36:49;"like you said, you know,"
36:49;36:51;"a lot of people are gonna be attracted to it"
36:51;36:54;"because of what they might find humorous"
36:54;36:57;"about aspects of the Chet Heng's persona,"
36:57;37:01;"but it's one of those things where it's, you know,"
37:01;37:01;"sometimes on this show,"
37:01;37:05;"we talk about these disgusting brand collabs"
37:05;37:06;"that they do just for a bit,"
37:06;37:11;"like birthday cake mayonnaise or the Hershey's Yingling,"
37:11;37:12;"just (beep) that people put together and you drink it"
37:12;37:14;"and all you're left with is being like,"
37:14;37:16;"that was gross, you didn't need to make this."
37:16;37:18;"Well, here's the thing about this."
37:18;37:20;"I don't care if you sign up for this as a bit,"
37:20;37:23;"in a month, when you look at your perfect 12 pack abs,"
37:23;37:27;"you're gonna say, bit or no bit, I'm in good shape."
37:27;37:28;"I feel better about myself."
37:28;37:32;"I'm stronger, I'm healthier, I'm a better person,"
37:32;37:37;"better husband, better father, better number cruncher,"
37:37;37:39;"better memer."
37:39;37:39;"- Oh yeah."
37:39;37:41;"- The bit becomes real."
37:41;37:41;"- I agree."
37:41;37:44;"I mean, you know, I might've signed up for the novelty,"
37:44;37:46;"but when I was 33 burpees deep,"
37:46;37:49;"there wasn't anything funny about that, okay?"
37:49;37:53;"And by the way, Matt just sent a link"
37:53;37:55;"to the current Hank's Fit website"
37:55;37:58;"and it's been switched to a wait list, so."
37:58;38:00;"- Okay, all right."
38:00;38:02;"- You got in on the ground floor, that's great."
38:02;38:04;"- And I, you know, I feel so great for it."
38:04;38:06;"Yeah, I feel like I'm part of an exclusive club."
38:06;38:07;"I've signed up for the month,"
38:07;38:10;"but I feel like this is gonna be maybe my whole year,"
38:10;38:12;"maybe this is the rest of my life."
38:12;38:13;"- You know what I'd like to see?"
38:13;38:18;"I'd like to see you so ripped, so in shape,"
38:18;38:21;"that by New Year's next year,"
38:21;38:26;"you part ways with Hank's Fit and you drop Seinfeld Fit."
38:26;38:26;"- Ooh, Seinfeld Fit."
38:26;38:28;"- And you pay it forward, Seinfeld Fit."
38:28;38:31;"Imagine you put your meme making talent"
38:31;38:34;"and combined it with motivational workout stuff,"
38:34;38:37;"like a funny picture of George with his shirt off"
38:37;38:39;"from the Shrinkage episode."
38:39;38:42;"And I don't know, that is something about like,"
38:42;38:43;"I don't know."
38:43;38:44;"Like, you're the memer."
38:44;38:47;"- I feel like I could be texting people, like, you know,"
38:47;38:50;"what's the deal with how out of shape you are,"
38:50;38:51;"things like that."
38:51;38:53;"That might be a good like opening text."
38:53;38:55;"- Maybe that's the future of work."
38:55;38:57;"'Cause truly I can say the times when I've been the most fit"
38:57;39:00;"working out the most, you realize"
39:00;39:01;"you don't need much in life."
39:01;39:03;"You got a few good people in your life."
39:03;39:06;"You feel like you're in good shape and you exercise."
39:06;39:07;"You have real good quality of life."
39:07;39:08;"You don't need much beyond that."
39:08;39:11;"And maybe people talk about the great resignation."
39:11;39:14;"People don't wanna work in traditional environments anymore."
39:14;39:16;"You'll have to run the numbers on the Seinfeld."
39:16;39:19;"But is it possible that if everybody in America"
39:19;39:22;"had 10 to 20 clients that they trained,"
39:22;39:25;"eventually the whole country could be training each other"
39:25;39:27;"and the money would flow enough"
39:27;39:28;"to give everybody a good quality of life,"
39:28;39:31;"everybody be in a good mood because they'd be in shape"
39:31;39:33;"and have those endorphins flowing."
39:33;39:36;"I feel like this could actually like save America."
39:36;39:39;"- That actually brings me up to my only real question"
39:39;39:42;"about this, which is realistically,"
39:42;39:46;"Chet Hanks to get as fit as he is,"
39:46;39:47;"most likely as a trainer."
39:47;39:51;"So is he getting this fitness routine from a trainer"
39:51;39:54;"and he is not accusing him of anything."
39:54;39:58;"The trainer may be part like low key, a part of this,"
39:58;40:02;"but or is he just full off half cocked creating something"
40:02;40:03;"and throwing it at you?"
40:03;40:04;"- Yeah, it's a good question."
40:04;40:07;"I mean, he's referenced his team"
40:07;40:11;"and I have to assume that his team is a little bit more,"
40:11;40:13;"they may have studied kinesiology"
40:13;40:15;"or been a little bit more seasoned"
40:15;40:16;"in the personal training world."
40:16;40:19;"But I mean, I don't know if I'm not taking the practice"
40:19;40:21;"of personal training seriously enough,"
40:21;40:24;"but I feel like it is something that you could concoct"
40:24;40:26;"on your own and put out there."
40:26;40:28;"Like you could create the Nick Fit program"
40:28;40:30;"and it's based on your own style,"
40:30;40:33;"your own what works for you, right?"
40:33;40:36;"I mean, there are no qualifications here"
40:36;40:38;"that I had to really check for."
40:38;40:40;"- Well, you would hope he has a trainer"
40:40;40:42;"because he's standing on the shoulder of giants."
40:42;40:44;"And then eventually in a few years,"
40:44;40:47;"when you're in your dojo, Nick, and you're training,"
40:47;40:49;"you're 20, you're golden 20."
40:49;40:50;"You say, what's up?"
40:50;40:51;"My name is Nick Weidenfeld."
40:51;40:53;"I'm a little bit about me."
40:53;40:54;"- I trained under Seinfeld."
40:54;40:56;"- I trained under Seinfeld."
40:56;40:57;"- I trained under Chet Hanks."
40:57;40:59;"- Trained under Chet Hanks,"
40:59;41:03;"who trained under Billy Blanks, blessed be thy name."
41:03;41:05;"You know, that's actually like a lot of spiritual teachers"
41:05;41:07;"do that as well."
41:07;41:11;"Like a guru, like the Maharishi type,"
41:11;41:14;"they would talk to you totally about the lineage,"
41:14;41:16;"about who they studied under,"
41:16;41:19;"and that this knowledge you paid forward and say,"
41:19;41:22;"and I hope one day that somebody in this room"
41:22;41:25;"will be giving the same speech to their 20 students."
41:25;41:27;"And then eventually, I think it actually could happen"
41:27;41:29;"that it literally comes full circle."
41:29;41:31;"And one day Chet Hanks is saying, you know what?"
41:31;41:33;"I haven't studied."
41:33;41:34;"I'd like to improve my technique."
41:34;41:36;"I think I could get back with a trainer."
41:36;41:39;"And then he meets somebody who trains him."
41:39;41:41;"And he says, I really like your style."
41:41;41:44;"There's elements of it that remind me of my own teachings."
41:44;41:46;"And yet you've put a totally new spin on it."
41:46;41:48;"And you've opened my eyes to new aspects of it."
41:48;41:49;"Can you tell me a bit about your background?"
41:49;41:53;"And they say, well, I studied under Selena Gomez,"
41:53;41:55;"who studied under Bill Kreutzman, who studied,"
41:55;41:57;"you know, et cetera."
41:57;42:00;"And then eventually gets back to Seinfeld 2000,"
42:00;42:03;"who studied under you, Sensei."
42:03;42:04;"- So this is like a-- - And there's like a tear,"
42:04;42:06;"a single tear goes down Chet's face."
42:06;42:08;"And he's like, let's get it."
42:08;42:11;"- Let's (beep) go, homie."
42:11;42:12;"- This could happen."
42:12;42:15;"This could save, let's get Bernie Sanders on the phone."
42:15;42:17;"If everybody had 20 students that they trained."
42:17;42:19;"I'll tell you, the only thing about this"
42:19;42:21;"is that it does require commitment."
42:21;42:22;"Obviously, there's gonna be some people"
42:22;42:23;"who are gonna have certain issues"
42:23;42:26;"that prevent them from training."
42:26;42:28;"But you know, we could figure out something else"
42:28;42:29;"for those people."
42:29;42:32;"But you know, for a lot of people, this could really work."
42:32;42:34;"- But I think the commitment-- - The money's flowing."
42:34;42:36;"The money's flowing, the fitness is flowing."
42:36;42:40;"I think there'd be no more political conflict."
42:40;42:43;"I think this could end the era of polarization"
42:43;42:45;"if everybody trained everybody else."
42:45;42:46;"- I think it's a beautiful thing."
42:46;42:48;"And I think, you know, to your point about the commitment,"
42:48;42:52;"the motivation, I think, remember that celebrity aspect,"
42:52;42:55;"that heroism is kind of what's driving it, you know?"
42:55;42:59;"So, you know, if I wanna join the Widenfit movement,"
42:59;43:02;"you know, as part of the cult of Weidenfeld,"
43:02;43:03;"I'm in it, I'm locked into the mindset."
43:03;43:07;"And I think that that's the way that you connect everybody."
43:07;43:09;"- Yeah, and some people, it's gonna be some unusual stuff."
43:09;43:11;"Bob Pollard is gonna say, Jake's like,"
43:11;43:12;"""Well, where do I start?"""
43:12;43:13;"Bob's some burpees, and he's gonna say,"
43:13;43:16;"""No, I want you to go down to your local field"
43:16;43:17;"""and hit 100 home runs."
43:17;43:20;"""Just go stand on home plate and just start,"
43:20;43:23;"""just whacking the ball until you knock it out of the park."
43:23;43:25;"""And every time that happens, you gotta walk over,"
43:25;43:27;"""go get it, go back to home plate."""
43:27;43:29;"Imagine if you did that every day."
43:29;43:33;"Just went by yourself with one baseball and one bat,"
43:33;43:37;"and you just had to whack it out of the park 100 times."
43:37;43:38;"How many steps would you get?"
43:38;43:40;"That'd be like walking 30 miles."
43:40;43:41;"- Not to mention the satisfaction of, you know,"
43:41;43:44;"the achievement of seeing your ball really fly that way."
43:44;43:46;"It would really do something for, you know,"
43:46;43:48;"your self-esteem as well, you know?"
43:48;43:49;"I love it."
43:49;43:50;"- You know who I would follow?"
43:50;43:52;"I just wanna say, 'cause I, you know,"
43:52;43:54;"I follow a lot of fitness."
43:54;43:57;"I didn't know about the Chet Fit,"
43:57;44:00;"but I do follow a lot of sort of fit Instagram,"
44:00;44:02;"you know, health Instagram stuff."
44:02;44:04;"And you know who is like the most inspirational,"
44:04;44:07;"who I actually would take a class from,"
44:07;44:11;"and I joined there 20, is Action Bronson."
44:11;44:12;"- Oh, right."
44:12;44:16;"- And his transformation on is so inspiring."
44:16;44:18;"And I just get so into watching, like,"
44:18;44:20;"he is in that gym and he's doing things,"
44:20;44:22;"and you made me think of it with the Bob Pollard"
44:22;44:23;"just swing a bat around."
44:23;44:24;"Like, he's doing these,"
44:24;44:26;"like he's just swinging these heavy bats around."
44:26;44:29;"But his body transformation,"
44:29;44:32;"his commitment to working out is so inspiring."
44:32;44:34;"And you know, I feel like,"
44:34;44:36;"given this is theoretically a music show."
44:36;44:38;"- I've heard a lot of people talk about"
44:38;44:39;"being inspired by Action Bronson."
44:39;44:43;"And actually on the topic of rappers from Queens,"
44:43;44:44;"you know what I just thought?"
44:44;44:46;"Friend of the show, who actually is in incredible shape"
44:46;44:49;"and would be a great trainer, Despot Fit."
44:49;44:50;"- Oh."
44:50;44:52;"- I think, imagine if there was Despot Fit."
44:52;44:53;"- Oh yeah."
44:53;44:54;"- When I started working out,"
44:54;44:56;"I'd call Alec to talk about it."
44:56;44:59;"'Cause he's so, yeah, he's an inspiration, man."
44:59;45:02;"- He knows about pea protein and stuff like that."
45:02;45:04;"- We should sign him up for Chet Fit,"
45:04;45:08;"just so he can be a real, he can give us,"
45:08;45:11;"I don't wanna, I definitely want Seinfeld"
45:11;45:13;"on that journey feeling super inspired."
45:13;45:15;"But it would be nice to get Despot as a, you know,"
45:15;45:17;"sort of a knowledgeable person to sort of weigh in"
45:17;45:20;"on what he thinks, you know, pro to pro."
45:20;45:21;"- Oh, for sure."
45:21;45:23;"- All right, we're gonna get that."
45:23;45:25;"We're gonna reach out to Despot about that."

46:11;46:13;"we're off to a great start of 2022."
46:13;46:16;"We've talked sports, we've talked fitness."
46:16;46:19;"I think it's time to talk about cars,"
46:19;46:21;"and then we're gonna finish up the show with whiskey."
46:21;46:24;"That's time crisis in 2022."
46:24;46:26;"Sports, fitness, cars, and whiskey."
46:26;46:28;"All right, guys, what cars are you looking forward to"
46:28;46:30;"in 2022?"
46:30;46:32;"- I mean, this is just very on brand for me,"
46:32;46:35;"but just, I'm honestly looking into like a new Honda Odyssey."
46:35;46:37;"- Oh, really?"
46:37;46:40;"- Yeah, I have a 2011 Honda Odyssey now."
46:40;46:42;"I'm thinking about in the next year"
46:42;46:45;"buying a brand new Honda Odyssey."
46:45;46:48;"But again, with the supply chain stuff, it's expensive."
46:48;46:50;"So I might wait another year."
46:50;46:52;"- And you better put your order in now."
46:52;46:53;"- Yeah."
46:53;46:54;"- Can't you get a good deal?"
46:54;46:55;"'Cause people always say,"
46:55;46:58;"as soon as a car drives off the lot, it's worth 50%."
46:58;47:00;"So how come people don't just go hang out"
47:00;47:03;"at car dealerships and wait for one to drive off the lot"
47:03;47:05;"and go up to them and say, excuse me,"
47:05;47:09;"I'd like to buy your Odyssey, I've got cash."
47:09;47:11;"I think legally they have to give it to you."
47:11;47:12;"They drove it off the lot."
47:12;47:15;"I'll give you exactly 50%."
47:15;47:16;"- Sounds like a deal to me."
47:16;47:17;"- I think it's like with elections,"
47:17;47:20;"you have to be like 50 yards away."
47:20;47:22;"But still, once they're off the lot,"
47:22;47:25;"if you can flag them down, you get that car for half off."
47:25;47:27;"- What do you love about the Odyssey in particular"
47:27;47:30;"that you're gonna wanna double up?"
47:30;47:31;"- I would sell the old one, obviously,"
47:31;47:33;"but I love the carrying capacity."
47:33;47:36;"Whether that's, you have the bench seat in the back,"
47:36;47:38;"you could easily carry eight adults,"
47:38;47:40;"which I've done numerous times,"
47:40;47:42;"or you can take all the seats out"
47:42;47:44;"and you can slide like a four by eight sheet"
47:44;47:46;"of plywood or drywall in there."
47:46;47:49;"I schlep a lot of lumber and stuff around, sometimes art."
47:49;47:51;"It's basically like having a pickup truck,"
47:51;47:55;"but it's much more flexible in its usage."
47:55;47:56;"- Okay."
47:56;47:57;"- Yeah."
47:57;47:58;"- That's a great van."
47:58;47:59;"I mean, I don't know if we've talked about this on the show,"
47:59;48:01;"but that was the original Vampire Weekend van"
48:01;48:03;"was a Honda Odyssey."
48:03;48:04;"- Right, I remember."
48:04;48:09;"- We did multiple full US tours in that,"
48:09;48:10;"put thousands of miles on it."
48:10;48:11;"That's a good car."
48:11;48:12;"- Did you guys have a tour manager"
48:12;48:14;"or was it just the four of you plus gear?"
48:14;48:17;"- No, that was four of us plus gear, early days."
48:17;48:19;"Actually, that makes me wonder."
48:19;48:22;"I feel like sometimes when I look at,"
48:22;48:25;"I love that we're actually talking about cars now."
48:25;48:27;"Self-fulfilling prophecy."
48:27;48:30;"Sometimes when I look at like new cars,"
48:30;48:33;"I'm like shocked by like consumer design"
48:33;48:37;"has gotten debatably better in a lot of fields."
48:37;48:40;"Like today, if you wanted to, you know,"
48:40;48:44;"buy some stuff for your kitchen or buy some clothes"
48:44;48:47;"and you didn't want to look like a total dweeb,"
48:47;48:48;"you would have some options, you know,"
48:48;48:50;"like in regular stuff."
48:50;48:54;"You know, computers and phones arguably look like"
48:54;48:56;"pretty good these days."
48:56;48:59;"There's every time I go check in on some car"
48:59;49:02;"and I see like, what does the 2022 this or that look like?"
49:02;49:04;"I'm always like, this is disgusting."
49:04;49:06;"Cars look like (beep)"
49:06;49:08;"That's what I want to say about cars in 2022."
49:08;49:10;"They look like (beep) folks."
49:10;49:12;"What happened to car design?"
49:12;49:13;"And this is true across the board."
49:13;49:17;"Like even like fancy cars, looking at some new fancy cars,"
49:17;49:19;"they look like dog (beep)"
49:19;49:22;"and I'm actually looking at a 2022 Honda Odyssey."
49:22;49:23;"It looks terrible."
49:23;49:26;"I'm sorry to say that is not an attractive car."
49:26;49:28;"The old ones look way better."
49:28;49:30;"Am I just being an old head here?"
49:30;49:31;"- No, I don't like that swoop."
49:31;49:34;"There's like, if you notice in the two sliding doors,"
49:34;49:35;"in the driver's side door,"
49:35;49:36;"then the sliding door in back of it,"
49:36;49:38;"there's that weird swoop."
49:38;49:39;"Looks terrible."
49:39;49:42;"- I was so excited about the new Bronco."
49:42;49:44;"I was like, oh, this is going to be great."
49:44;49:45;"And they (beep) it up."
49:45;49:48;"It's same thing, weird round edges."
49:48;49:50;"It's just like, I don't know."
49:50;49:52;"It's like looking like a Lego car or something."
49:52;49:53;"- It's a real bummer."
49:53;49:56;"- Did you guys see that Hyundai Heritage Series"
49:56;49:58;"Grandeur EV concept car?"
49:58;50:00;"(laughing)"
50:00;50:01;"- What?"
50:01;50:02;"(laughing)"
50:02;50:04;"- That was making the rounds."
50:04;50:06;"- Wait, is this something you actually knew about"
50:06;50:09;"or did you just Google like 2022 car stuff?"
50:09;50:12;"- No, this was popping about a month,"
50:12;50:13;"month and a half ago."
50:13;50:14;"- Wait, okay, hold on."
50:14;50:15;"Slowly say what it is again."
50:15;50:17;"It's a Hyundai."
50:17;50:19;"- Yeah, it's the Hyundai Heritage Series"
50:19;50:21;"Grandeur EV concept car."
50:21;50:23;"It's not on the market."
50:23;50:24;"It could be."
50:24;50:26;"There was a lot of hype over this one."
50:26;50:28;"I texted a picture 'cause essentially"
50:28;50:30;"it looks like Hyundai has thrown it back"
50:30;50:30;"to their 80s kind of box."
50:30;50:31;"- Oh, wow."
50:31;50:33;"- Whoa, okay."
50:33;50:34;"- Yeah, this made waves."
50:34;50:35;"- This is fascinating."
50:35;50:37;"To all of our listeners,"
50:37;50:39;"this is actually worth looking up."
50:39;50:40;"This is interesting."
50:40;50:41;"- Yeah, it really is."
50:41;50:42;"- It's beautiful, right?"
50:42;50:45;"- It's sort of like when Doritos will do"
50:45;50:48;"like the throwback 1970s packaging."
50:48;50:49;"- Yeah. - Yeah, that's right."
50:49;50:53;"- They're just going full 70s in the body of the car."
50:53;50:55;"- It's like Daft Punk designed it with the lights."
50:55;50:58;"It has like a little bit of slickness."
50:58;50:59;"Okay, that's interesting."
50:59;51:01;"So this is a concept."
51:01;51:04;"They just dropped the concept and it's debatable"
51:04;51:05;"if they'll ever make it."
51:05;51:06;"- Yeah, I feel like most,"
51:06;51:07;"I don't know much about this,"
51:07;51:08;"but I feel like most concept cars"
51:08;51:10;"don't actually get produced,"
51:10;51:11;"but this one seems pretty practical."
51:11;51:13;"Like it seems like they could make this car"
51:13;51:15;"if they really wanted to."
51:15;51:17;"This is how cars should look, I feel."
51:17;51:18;"This is, they should take it back to the 80s."
51:18;51:20;"- I'm very interested. - Oh, the interior."
51:20;51:22;"Dude, the interior is rough."
51:22;51:23;"- Uh-oh."
51:23;51:25;"- I mean, the interior that I'm seeing"
51:25;51:27;"was pretty Daft Punk."
51:27;51:28;"- The seats are weird."
51:28;51:30;"Anyway, this is terrible radio."
51:30;51:33;"We gotta pivot off of this."
51:33;51:34;"- You listen to the new ""Time Crisis"","
51:34;51:37;"they spent 20 minutes describing a car."
51:37;51:39;"That's what people come to us for."
51:39;51:40;"One thing that just popped into my head,"
51:40;51:43;"'cause as soon as I saw this Hyundai Heritage Grandeur"
51:43;51:45;"EV concept car, I said,"
51:45;51:47;"""This looks like a grandpa car."""
51:47;51:49;"And I remember being a kid"
51:49;51:53;"and my grandpa had a grandpa car"
51:53;51:55;"and it was an Oldsmobile."
51:55;51:57;"And in my childish brain,"
51:57;51:59;"picture being five or six years old,"
51:59;52:01;"and I guess this is kind of true."
52:01;52:05;"I just assumed that Oldsmobiles were cars for old people."
52:05;52:06;"And that's why they were called that."
52:06;52:07;"Like they were literally,"
52:07;52:10;"I guess like a jitterbug is a phone for an old person."
52:10;52:14;"I really thought that Oldsmobile were cars for old people."
52:14;52:16;"What do Oldsmobiles look like in 2022?"
52:16;52:17;"Do they even still make them?"
52:17;52:19;"- Guys, we gotta get off this."
52:19;52:21;"- Okay, let's get onto whiskey."
52:21;52:22;"What?"
52:22;52:24;"(laughing)"
52:24;52:28;"What whiskey are you looking forward to?"
52:28;52:30;"- That Bob Dylan one."
52:30;52:33;"- Oh yeah, okay, actually, see?"
52:33;52:34;"I knew we were onto something."
52:34;52:35;"We actually didn't talk about this."
52:35;52:38;"We had a time crisis holiday party,"
52:38;52:40;"the end of the year,"
52:40;52:42;"had some great Italian food."
52:42;52:44;"Thank you, Apple."
52:44;52:47;"And Seinfeld, on the show, he's a number crunch guy,"
52:47;52:51;"but in our social life, he's our liquor guy, actually."
52:51;52:54;"When we're hanging out socially,"
52:54;52:57;"Seinfeld's, he's not crunching numbers."
52:57;52:59;"He's busting out liquor."
52:59;53:01;"He's the liquor man."
53:01;53:02;"When you have a party,"
53:02;53:04;"he sounds kind of like a mild-mannered guy on the radio,"
53:04;53:05;"on the internet radio,"
53:05;53:06;"but when you have a party,"
53:06;53:09;"Seinfeld has shown up with the hard stuff."
53:09;53:13;"And at our year-end party, Seinfeld came through,"
53:13;53:16;"and as always, he brought the liquor."
53:16;53:20;"And he brought two bottles of the hard stuff."
53:20;53:23;"One was Bob Dylan's whiskey."
53:23;53:27;"- Yeah, Heaven's Door is what it's called."
53:27;53:28;"Pretty good."
53:28;53:29;"Yeah, it was fine."
53:29;53:31;"- Yeah, we actually, we all, we drank it."
53:31;53:33;"It was pretty good."
53:33;53:34;"One point that I made,"
53:34;53:36;"which we had an interesting discussion about"
53:36;53:37;"at the holiday party was,"
53:37;53:39;"I always understood the song,"
53:39;53:40;"Knocking on Heaven's Door,"
53:40;53:43;"is about a dying cop."
53:43;53:45;"Just 'cause he says, ""Take this badge off of me,"
53:45;53:47;"I can't use it anymore."""
53:47;53:49;"So I always assumed the protagonist of,"
53:49;53:52;"or the main character of Knocking on Heaven's Door"
53:52;53:55;"is a cop who's been shot, and he's bleeding out."
53:55;53:58;"- It's like a sheriff in the Old West or something."
53:58;53:59;"- Yeah, it's probably a sheriff in the Old West,"
53:59;54:02;"but I don't know if there's anything about that song"
54:02;54:04;"that's specifically Old West."
54:04;54:07;"So it also could just be a cop anywhere."
54:07;54:08;"- Matt, throw that on."

57:35;57:36;"What is Southern Comfort?"

57:40;57:41;"I think it's a whiskey."
57:41;57:43;"- But bourbon is a whiskey."
57:43;57:45;"- But one time I bought a bottle of Southern Comfort"

58:01;58:03;"I just dumped the entire thing down the drain"
58:03;58:05;"'cause it was so gnarly."
58:05;58:07;"I mean, yeah, Southern Comfort is like--"
58:07;58:08;"- I basically did that"
58:08;58:11;"with the Florida Georgia Wines whiskey."

01:00:41;01:00:46;"Old Camp is a peach pecan, easy drinking, it is not,"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"easy drinking whiskey that doesn't sacrifice anything"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"to be smooth."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"We say, whatever you do, never go in alone"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"and always do it right."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"That's how they talk about it."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"- Wait a second, wait a second."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"They missed an amazing opportunity, peach pecan."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"It should have been peach orange"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"'cause peaches come from Georgia"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"and oranges come from Florida."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- That sounds even nastier though."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"- Fruit flavored whiskey."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"How about this like--"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"- They're pushing the envelope with the peach whiskey."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"We're all, you know, we're so fired up."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- Okay, let's just do-- - We're so fired up about this."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"- How about just orange peach smoothies?"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"- And we're just yelling over each other."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"(laughing)"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- Everybody knows on ""Time Crisis,"""
01:01:24;01:01:26;"we kind of dip your toes,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"we always kick it off with sports talk, dip our toes,"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"and then we get into fitness, you know, a lot,"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"there's a lot of, we have a lot of common ground."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"It's very respectful."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"But then once we get into cars and whiskey in hour two,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"things get a little bit-- - Gloves come off."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- Gloves come off."
01:01:42;01:01:45;"The boys get a little spicy in hour two"
01:01:45;01:01:49;"and we hit the cars and whiskey section of TC."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Wait, how about this,"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"back to the fruit flavored whiskey song."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"How about this as a conceit?"
01:01:54;01:01:57;"'Cause actually, Jake, I want you to go away and write this."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Over the course of the night,"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"you got different times for different types of whiskey."
01:02:02;01:02:06;"Maybe around 2 a.m., you and your buddy go sit"
01:02:06;01:02:10;"at one of those frosted glass outdoor tables"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"and you're having a late night heart to heart."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"You're gonna be wanting to share a scotch."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- Yeah. - You know, maybe,"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"when the party's just kind of peaking at like 11 p.m.,"
01:02:18;01:02:21;"things are really getting kind of lit,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"that's when you want some Jack Daniels."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"But when it's the beginning of the night"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"and you just wanna get things moving to start,"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"fruit flavored whiskey."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"And that could be, it's like you always kick it off"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"with fruit flavored whiskey."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"- Or it's a breakfast whiskey."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"(laughing)"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"- Oh yeah, like, we had a wild night last night,"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"kicked it off with some Jack, yeah."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"We partied all night long."
01:02:45;01:02:50;"By 4 a.m., me and Jake were sipping scotch by the lake."
01:02:50;01:02:56;"I was down by the lake, sipping scotch with Jake."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"Yeah, we took it all the way last night."
01:02:58;01:03:02;"And then it's like, we roll out of bed, hung over his phone,"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"walked down to the breakfast table."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"And we're like, what's gonna pair"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"with pancakes and waffles?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Fruit flavored whiskey."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"It's 8.15 Sunday morning, but the party doesn't stop."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Fruit flavored whiskey."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- No, hell no."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"It is a breakfast whiskey."
01:03:17;01:03:21;"- I gotta say, I like the orange peach whiskey pitch."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"And I feel like there's a great,"
01:03:23;01:03:26;"yeah, and there's a great like 90s style commercial"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"where like one of the FGL guys is like on one side"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"of the Florida Georgia line and the other guy's the other."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And it's like, in Florida,"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"we make our whiskey with oranges, you know what I mean?"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"Except we're really putting it down."
01:03:36;01:03:39;"(laughing)"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"In Georgia, we make it with peach,"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"and then they're like, peach, orange, you know what I mean?"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"And then somehow the two collide,"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"maybe in the altercation ensues."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"And then they taste it, and they're like,"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"you know what I mean?"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"- Yeah, then Ross Perot comes out."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- Irish guy."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"(laughing)"
01:03:56;01:04:02;"- Down in Florida, we like our fruit flavored whiskey"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"to have some of our famous oranges."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"(laughing)"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Yeah, and then in Georgia,"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"we prefer a little peach with our fruit flavored whiskey."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"Orange, peach, orange, peach, and then like, yeah."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"- Some little kid or something is like,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"hey, why don't you mix them?"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Yeah, or something like that, or grandma."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"- Then there's just like some guy in the background"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"be like, why do you have to have fruit flavored whiskey,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"period, shut up."
01:04:27;01:04:30;"I'm gonna do some more research"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"about fruit flavored whiskey."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"- I just want to read this review on the internet"
01:04:34;01:04:37;"about Old Camp whiskey, it's pretty good."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"My first impression was, huh?"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"That's not terrible though."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"Second impression was that I'll never drink this straight."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Though it's possible application in cocktails"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"could be a good thing, especially in small doses."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"It could also be useful in the kitchen"
01:04:50;01:04:54;"as an ingredient to a vinaigrette or some kind of sauce,"
01:04:54;01:04:58;"maybe even a glaze on a pork chop."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"So yeah, not terrible."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Okay."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"- Something that you would drink"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"or just glaze a pork chop in."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"(laughing)"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"What's the diff?"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"- Either way."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"- All good."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"- I want a whiskey that I can drink"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"or glaze a pork chop with."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"- That person's really trying to make it work."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"Did he say also in small doses?"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"- Yeah, really emphasize that."
01:05:22;01:05:27;"- Sounds like somebody who has some buyer's remorse"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"who's just trying to--"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"- What do people do is Southern Comfort?"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Is there like a famous mixed drink"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"that involves Southern Comfort?"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"- That's a good question."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"I mean, I don't understand."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"I was shocked that that was a product on the market."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"- I feel it's like a big, like when you start drinking,"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"you know what I mean?"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"- I think it's like 17 year old girls."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"It's like candy."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"- Oh, there's a drink called the SoCo Cola,"
01:05:48;01:05:52;"which is Southern Comfort and Coke or Pepsi"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"served in a highball glass."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"- Oh, it's also a whiskey liqueur,"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"naturally fruit flavored whiskey liqueur"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"with fruit and spice accents."
01:06:01;01:06:04;"The brand was originally created by bartender"
01:06:04;01:06:08;"Martin Heron in New Orleans in 1874."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Damn."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"- It's also the main ingredient in the Alabama Slamma,"
01:06:13;01:06:19;"which I know because of that amazing moment in ""Cocktail"""
01:06:19;01:06:21;"when Tom Cruise gets up on the bar"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"and delivers his big poem, like his big soliloquy."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"And I just always remember going,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"""The Alabama Slamma."""
01:06:28;01:06:31;"It's a great scene that all of you should definitely look up"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"but it's a main, yeah."
01:06:34;01:06:37;"- I'm just looking, do you drink Southern Comfort straight?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"- They have a branded eggnog."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"- Fruit flavored whiskey."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"(mimics music)"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"All right, well, I think that about does it."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"We covered the big four,"
01:06:46;01:06:50;"so I guess we could wrap up early today"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"and we'll be back in two weeks."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"Oh, I forgot we gotta do the top five."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"- It's time for the top five."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- Five on iTunes."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"- So today we're doing the top five cars"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"everybody's looking forward to in 2022."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"If you said anything already in the previous segment,"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"you can't reuse it, but we're gonna go around."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"So hopefully we're gonna get 20 different cars"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"if each guy has a different top five."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Seinfeld, we're starting with you."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"Just kidding, for this week's top five,"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"we're comparing the top five songs of today"
01:07:21;01:07:25;"with the top five songs this week in 1990."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Why 1990?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Seinfeld?"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- Oh, that's the year Chet Hanks was born."
01:07:30;01:07:34;"- Perfect, 1990, just a classic random year."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"I'm actually very curious to see what's in there."
01:07:36;01:07:40;"I've always considered like '89 to '91 was such like a,"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"it was basically still the '80s."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"It was like the hot, you know,"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"the late, late '80s, 1990 to '91."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Okay, so the top five song this week in 1990,"

01:11:44;01:11:46;"the cartoon world, the Negaverse."
01:11:46;01:11:49;"And I forgot that this was like,"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"the movie was made around the time"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"that he left basketball to play baseball."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"So there's a part where the Bugs Bunny and all them"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"are saying, ""Oh, you gotta help us."""
01:11:58;01:12:01;"And he says, ""Guys, I don't play basketball anymore."""
01:12:01;01:12:02;"I don't know if he uses the word retired,"

01:12:03;01:12:05;"And they're like, ""Yeah, right."""
01:12:05;01:12:07;"So maybe somebody could make a Space Jam."

01:12:11;01:12:13;"And he could still respect the retirement,"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"but it's a movie where basically he gets sucked"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"into the Warner Brothers universe"
01:12:18;01:12:21;"and they need him to act because otherwise"
01:12:21;01:12:24;"they'll be forced into slavery."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"That was something that also shocked me,"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"is in Space Jam, they very specifically say,"

01:36:00;01:36:06;"that was her primary inspiration for writing easy on me and she really resents the fact that people"
01:36:06;01:36:10;"think it's about her divorce and she finds it creepy that people kind of like reading into"
01:36:10;01:36:15;"her personal life she's on record as saying it's really not that deep yeah she said it's really"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"not that deep i was listening to classic rock radio and i heard faithfully by journey and i"

01:41:39;01:41:44;"nine inch nails deep dive i mean i think i like nine inch nails i always really respected them"
01:41:44;01:41:50;"i think i like nine inch nails i mean i definitely remember and i only said that i was like tried to"
01:41:50;01:41:54;"get into them and couldn't i just felt like i wasn't like a real fan i was like they're cool"
01:41:54;01:42:01;"because i just remember like other kids at school being into nine inch nails oh yeah yeah i remember"
01:42:01;01:42:06;"my friend willie rogers had this like a nine inch nails t-shirt the one that was just like this"
01:42:06;01:42:11;"coiled piece of rope on it just all like the visual it was so like intense and weird"
01:42:11;01:42:18;"yeah i just don't like the like humorless like dour like serious like dark energy vibe and it's"
01:42:18;01:42:25;"like it doesn't really rock it's not fun it's like not actually disturbing or like i don't know i"
01:42:25;01:42:30;"just i just thought they were just so kind of middle of the road and lame is just somewhere"
01:42:30;01:42:38;"halfway between janet jackson and tool and tool both of whom you love mix them together"
01:42:38;01:42:45;"you're kind of a no man's land but that that really is they really are janet jackson meets"
01:42:45;01:42:52;"tool do you like trent resner's soundtrack work with atticus ross it's very innocuous i guess it's"
01:42:52;01:42:58;"fine does he do all the fincher stuff right yeah i mean i like some fincher movies i like zodiac"
01:42:58;01:43:03;"really that's i don't think he's the one he did most recently he did social network the album"
01:43:03;01:43:09;"yeah have you jammed the halsey album jake haven't jammed it well maybe you might like it because it"
01:43:09;01:43:17;"takes some of that uh janet jackson meets tool vibes but takes it back to the the female singer"
01:43:17;01:43:25;"kind of pop r&b side where it belongs the kid leroy and justin beaver stay all right i don't"
01:43:25;01:43:29;"even want to hear this one we've talked about enough cool that was the number two song of this"
01:43:29;01:43:36;"era okay number one songs now we're on to the number one songs of both 1990 and 2021 this week"
01:43:36;01:43:43;"in 1990 phil collins with another day in paradise this was the number one song on the charts"
01:43:43;01:43:59;"this is a song about homelessness yep"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"do you know that song i'm not totally sure"
01:44:06;01:44:11;"whoa david crosby sings backing vocals on the song that's sick"
01:44:11;01:44:25;"weird intro just like oh yeah i know this i know this yeah you know"
01:44:25;01:44:31;"do"
01:44:31;01:44:45;"she calls out to the man on the street sir can you help me"
01:44:48;01:44:55;"it's cold and i know where to school there's somewhere you can tell me"
01:44:55;01:45:05;"he walks on doesn't look back i remember watching this video on mtv when i was 13"
01:45:05;01:45:11;"what's the video like is it just about like is it literal yeah if i remember correctly"
01:45:12;01:45:18;"i remember hearing the song through the television i actually don't remember the visuals of the video"
01:45:18;01:45:25;"i'm surprised this is 1990 if you just played this for me i would guess like 83 yeah"
01:45:37;01:45:45;"it's a cool song vibey i remember when i was 13 just being like not liking the earnest message"
01:45:45;01:45:57;"i mean it doesn't exactly sound like it but it makes me think of uh"
01:45:57;01:46:02;"a friend of the show bruce hornsby and uh yes the way it is just kind of like"
01:46:02;01:46:10;"sophisticated adult pop music from this era that's like about social issues yep i thought of that too"
01:46:10;01:46:29;"did phil collins retire not exactly but does he still play shows my understanding i just"
01:46:29;01:46:34;"that he's genesis is playing shows but he's like either in a wheelchair or has to sit down"
01:46:34;01:46:41;"but he had like some serious physical issues like back problems is he playing drums no i think he's"
01:46:41;01:46:46;"just singing and i talked to some people that like he was just like in chicago playing and i"
01:46:46;01:46:52;"know some genesis heads who were out there and they said it's yeah he's definitely not retired"
01:46:52;01:46:59;"so sorry it's not easy so they're playing is peter gabriel genesis like on these new shows"
01:46:59;01:47:06;"it's peter gabriel phil collins no this is like 80s lineup 80s reunion okay they're not doing"
01:47:06;01:47:18;"stuff from like the early 70s you can tell from the lines on her face you can see that she's been"
01:47:18;01:47:28;"there probably been moved on from every place cause she didn't fit in there"
01:47:28;01:47:44;"oh think twice it's another day for you and me in paradise oh think twice it's just another day"
