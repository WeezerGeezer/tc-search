00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:12;"This week, we jump back in to the endless Flamin' Hot War."
00:12;00:21;"Plus, we listen to music from Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, and the Killers."
00:21;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:46;00:54;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:01;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:15;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:15;01:18;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:18;01:20;"The boys are hot to trot."
01:20;01:24;"We're, uh, this is not a banked up, not super banked."
01:24;01:28;"I'm talking to you guys live from the great city of Chicago."
01:28;01:31;"My last trip to Chicago, I think, uh, Jake, you were here."
01:31;01:35;"I was just gonna ask, are you in the same hotel?"
01:35;01:36;"Doesn't look like it."
01:36;01:37;"No, this is a different hotel."
01:37;01:42;"So I remember, um, yeah, our famed trip to Chicago in 2019,"
01:42;01:47;"when we stayed in that really beautiful, old, ornate hotel."
01:47;01:51;"We did an episode with, um, the dude that's in that punk band."
01:51;01:54;"Oh yeah, Existential Arby's."
01:54;01:56;"Oh right, Existential Arby's."
01:56;02:01;"We played the same venue as 2019, except we did two nights."
02:01;02:02;"Nihilist Arby's."
02:02;02:03;"Nihilist Arby's."
02:03;02:06;"Apologies to Nihilist Arby's."
02:06;02:08;"Was it warmer this time?"
02:08;02:14;"Yeah, I was thinking about that because it was really cold in June 2019."
02:14;02:18;"This is actually some, like, the most perfect, like, Chicago weather I've ever seen."
02:18;02:23;"Just really nice days, like highs in the mid 80s."
02:23;02:27;"When we're hitting the stage, nice breeze coming off the lake, like in the 70s."
02:27;02:29;"Two perfect nights."
02:29;02:30;"That rules."
02:30;02:33;"What did you do, uh, encore-wise last night?"
02:33;02:37;"Well, night two encore, what did we get?"
02:37;02:40;"It's a bit of a blur between the two nights."
02:40;02:44;"I know, I know we actually pulled off, like, a decent beast of burden."
02:44;02:46;"Okay."
02:46;02:48;"That kind of, like, sounded like the song."
02:48;02:51;"Oh, of course, somebody reques- somebody right up front had a sign."
02:51;02:54;"And we kind of prepared for it because we thought this might be the case."
02:54;02:56;"Because the second show was a Saturday."
02:56;03:00;"And so somebody up front had a sign saying ""Saturday in the Park, Chicago."""
03:00;03:01;"Nice."
03:01;03:04;"So we actually learned the verse through the chorus."
03:04;03:07;"It's a very sophisticated song."
03:07;03:11;"I was having a hard time, you know, the beginning is, like, pretty straight ahead."
03:11;03:14;"""Saturday in the park, must have been the fourth of July."
03:14;03:16;"I think it was the fourth of July."""
03:16;03:19;"And then that next chord change is really hard for me to remember."
03:19;03:28;"♪ People dancing, people laughing, a man selling ice cream, singing Italian songs. ♪"
03:28;03:32;"It seems very complex and no shocker there, it's Chicago."
03:32;03:34;"It's, uh, jazz prog."
03:34;03:41;"And this was a Saturday in the park, in, not on the fourth of July, but in late July in Chicago."
03:41;03:43;"So that was a request."
03:43;03:46;"There's just been so many over this tour."
03:46;03:52;"And I've been debating if, now that we know some of, like, the classic requests, you know,"
03:52;03:57;"I know sometimes people just make a blanket request for a band or an artist or the songs."
03:57;04:00;"And I've wondered, should we, like, learn these songs better?"
04:00;04:01;"And then I realized, no."
04:01;04:04;"I love the vibe of just being on stage and just everybody like,"
04:04;04:06;"""Uh, I think maybe it goes like this."
04:06;04:07;"Like, I think we got to keep it loose."""

04:55;04:58;"I mean, I don't know if you want to, like, peek too much behind the curtain,"
04:58;05:02;"but, like, is there someone googling the song and bringing up the chords on,"
05:02;05:06;"on a, on like a teleprompter or, like, are you just totally..."
05:06;05:09;"No, no, I mean, maybe we could try that eventually."
05:09;05:11;"It would still be pretty loose."
05:11;05:15;"We kind of just have a system where generally see if any of the people playing, you know, like,"
05:15;05:19;"harmonic instruments know where to start."
05:19;05:24;"So it's usually, most of the time, be Colin on guitar, Will on keys."
05:24;05:27;"And if one of them knows it, they're kind of standing next to each other"
05:27;05:30;"and Baio's over there kind of being like, ""Oh, wait, wait, wait."""
05:30;05:33;"So sometimes they're just kind of talking to each other."
05:33;05:36;"Oh, there's Cranberries Linger the other day."
05:36;05:40;"We get a decent amount of requests for Mountain Brews,"
05:40;05:42;"which I'd like to get back in rotation."
05:42;05:45;"I attempted it one night, but I was kind of on the fly trying to remember,"
05:45;05:48;"like, ""Oh, yeah, that's a minor five."""
05:48;05:49;"I'll send you those chords."
05:49;05:50;"Yeah."
05:50;05:52;"♪ Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike? ♪"
05:52;05:54;"♪ Meet at the trailhead ♪"
05:54;05:55;"I got to remember that's minor there."
05:55;05:58;"♪ Meet at the trailhead, lie around a quarter to three ♪"
05:58;05:59;"Yeah, it's a G minor there."
05:59;06:01;"That's another funny thing."
06:01;06:03;"Sometimes we're doing it totally in the wrong key."
06:03;06:05;"And, like, I started singing and it's so high."
06:05;06:07;"It seems really hard to do."
06:07;06:09;"I mean, even if, like, I mean, you said,"
06:10;06:12;"""Wait, what did you just say before Mountain Brews?"""
06:12;06:13;"Oh, Cranberries Linger."
06:13;06:14;"Oh, Linger."
06:14;06:18;"I was like, it's such like a weird kind of slippery melody in the verse."
06:18;06:19;"You know, it's like..."
06:19;06:21;"Oh, yeah, I can't remember the verse at all."
06:21;06:25;"Luckily, I've always had this, even going back to, like, my high school days,"
06:25;06:28;"my middle school days, Sophisticated Up's days."
06:28;06:30;"I mean, I can get embarrassed about all sorts of stuff."
06:30;06:32;"But one thing I've never been embarrassed about is"
06:32;06:36;"standing on a stage in front of people and going, ""Nah, nah, nah."""
06:36;06:37;"I don't know why."
06:37;06:40;"Like, if I forget the words to our song or..."
06:40;06:43;"Because we used to, like, with the stuff I played on the show"
06:43;06:47;"when we had, like, Wes on, we're going into our early work."
06:47;06:50;"We would just go play these songs and, like, I would never even finish the lyrics."
06:50;06:54;"And I just kind of sometimes make it up on the fly."
06:54;06:56;"So, yeah, it is hard."
06:56;06:59;"And sometimes we start it and I'll just be like, ""Oh, I can't remember the verse."""
06:59;07:02;"And, you know, we keep it extremely loose."
07:02;07:04;"So you have no lyrical prompt either."
07:04;07:06;"Like, I wouldn't know the first words of Linger."
07:07;07:08;"No, no, no."

08:42;08:45;"I bet I've seen people requesting that four or five times."
08:45;08:47;"I'd love to hear it."
08:47;08:48;"Oh, and I was just going to say,"
08:48;08:50;"speaking of Chicago and Mountain Brews,"
08:50;08:52;"I remember that episode we did in the hotel."
08:52;08:55;"That was the week that I uploaded Mountain Brews"
08:55;08:58;"to the streaming services."
08:58;08:59;"Oh, crazy."
08:59;09:01;"And we did, we listened to like,"
09:01;09:03;"maybe the whole EP, I forget,"
09:03;09:06;"on that episode in the hotel room."
09:06;09:09;"So Mountain Brews was like brand new June of 2019."
09:09;09:11;"Five years of brews."
09:11;09:13;"Five years of brews, bro."

09:30;09:33;"Would you bring Jake out to do Mountain Brews?"
09:33;09:34;"Definitely consider it."
09:34;09:36;"Yeah, I think the streets might want it."
09:36;09:38;"Definitely consider it."
09:38;09:43;"Yeah, I think we're planning on going to the matinee show."
09:43;09:44;"Yeah, that'll be fun."
09:44;09:47;"I mean, maybe I would go to both if I could swing it."
09:47;09:48;"We're going to be there with our kid and stuff,"
09:48;09:51;"but I want to bring her to the matinee show."
09:51;09:54;"And then if I do brews,"
09:54;09:56;"I would just blow her lid."
09:56;09:58;"Bring the house down."
09:58;10:02;"Oh yeah, seeing daddy on stage at the garden."
10:02;10:05;"Seeing your favorite band on stage too."
10:05;10:07;"Lizzie's a vampire head."
10:07;10:08;"Yeah, she is."
10:08;10:10;"She always says vampire."
10:10;10:11;"Yeah."
10:11;10:12;"Love that."
10:12;10:13;"Yeah."
10:13;10:15;"There's an interesting conversation happening"
10:15;10:18;"that is pure TC just before I jumped on,"
10:18;10:21;"which is that Jake is drinking..."
10:21;10:23;"Drake."
10:24;10:25;"Well, I was wondering what Jake..."
10:25;10:27;"Ladies and gentlemen, Drake."
10:27;10:30;"Filling in for Seinfeld today."
10:30;10:34;"I asked Jake what he was drinking"
10:34;10:35;"because it looked like tequila"
10:35;10:38;"and we're on the early side,"
10:38;10:40;"but we're getting in."
10:40;10:41;"We're getting into it."
10:41;10:43;"And he said he was drinking..."
10:43;10:45;"What is it?"
10:45;10:47;"Glacial Cherry Gatorade."
10:47;10:49;"Yeah, and I held up the glass."
10:49;10:53;"It does look exactly like tequila and soda"
10:53;10:54;"with some lime juice in there."
10:54;10:57;"Wait, but it's a glacial cherry."
10:57;11:00;"The color is like a slightly milky white."
11:00;11:02;"Yeah, it's a milky white."
11:02;11:03;"I guess that's a little cooler than..."
11:03;11:06;"If this was like a tequila and soda"
11:06;11:07;"with a little lime in there,"
11:07;11:08;"it'd be a little warmer."
11:08;11:10;"That could be a margarita."
11:10;11:12;"A kind of pale margarita."
11:12;11:13;"What?"
11:13;11:15;"A pale margarita."
11:15;11:16;"Yeah."
11:16;11:17;"Pale margarita."
11:17;11:18;"I like that as a title."
11:18;11:20;"Yeah, that'd be a good song."
11:20;11:21;"But I'm drinking this Gatorade"
11:21;11:25;"because I'm recovering from a slight surgery,"
11:25;11:27;"a small surgery I had last week."
11:27;11:29;"This is great internet radio."
11:29;11:32;"I had a deviated septum corrected last week."
11:32;11:34;"So I'm still recovering from this surgery."
11:34;11:37;"So I'm not feeling great."
11:37;11:38;"I've been sleeping terribly."
11:38;11:42;"I'm on like day five of this recovery."
11:42;11:44;"I'm pretty congested if you can hear that."
11:44;11:48;"But I've had this crooked piece of cartilage"
11:48;11:52;"in my nose for the last 45 years or whatever."
11:52;11:54;"And I got it corrected because my sleep"
11:54;11:57;"and my nasal breathing has been kind of"
11:57;11:58;"worsening over the years."
11:58;12:01;"And so I'm drinking Gatorade tonight."
12:01;12:03;"I've heard a lot of people say that surgery"
12:03;12:05;"changed their life for the better."
12:05;12:07;"The people I've talked to are like,"
12:07;12:09;"""Oh my God, my breathing,"
12:09;12:10;"especially when I'm sleeping,"
12:10;12:10;"is so much better."""
12:10;12:12;"So I'm psyched."
12:12;12:13;"But I'm just..."
12:13;12:15;"It's been a little earlier"
12:15;12:16;"than I maybe thought it was going to be"
12:16;12:17;"in terms of the recovery."
12:18;12:19;"Mm-hmm."
12:19;12:21;"I mean, yeah, like general anesthesia, no joke."
12:21;12:24;"That'll make you feel weird?"
12:24;12:26;"Yeah, it makes your bowels weird."
12:26;12:30;"It's just been like a funky five days."
12:30;12:30;"So I'm a little..."
12:30;12:33;"Rolling a little slow."
12:33;12:35;"So your doctor prescribed you..."
12:35;12:35;"Glacial."
12:35;12:37;"Glacial Cherry Gatorade."
12:37;12:38;"Now is that over the counter?"
12:38;12:39;"Jake, I'm gonna..."
12:39;12:41;"Just on this pad."
12:41;12:42;"Jake, I'm gonna write you a prescription here"
12:42;12:43;"for Glacial Cherry."
12:43;12:47;"To be clear, I looked it up."
12:47;12:50;"It is Glacier Cherry."
12:50;12:50;"Okay."
12:50;12:53;"Because the Glacier Cherry"
12:53;12:57;"is also a cherry that I've found"
12:57;12:58;"that was..."
12:58;13:00;"It's a dark red cherry"
13:00;13:01;"introduced and patented"
13:01;13:04;"by Washington State University."
13:04;13:06;"So it's a variety of cherry"
13:06;13:08;"that they bred."
13:08;13:09;"Yes, they bred."
13:09;13:11;"It says it's crack resistant"
13:11;13:13;"and very flavorful."
13:13;13:16;"I don't know what crack resistant means."
13:16;13:17;"But so this is a..."
13:17;13:19;"So they've taken this lab cherry"
13:19;13:22;"and they're making this."
13:22;13:23;"And it's a dark red cherry,"
13:23;13:25;"but I assume maybe on the inside"
13:25;13:26;"is more of that milky..."
13:26;13:27;"Wait, so you're telling me"
13:27;13:28;"on the Gatorade bottle,"
13:28;13:31;"it says Glacier Cherry?"
13:31;13:31;"Yes."
13:31;13:33;"So there's no such thing as Glacial Cherry?"
13:33;13:35;"That might be a..."
13:35;13:38;"A Mandela effect?"
13:38;13:39;"A Mandela effect."
13:39;13:41;"Yes, exactly."
13:41;13:43;"Wait, so if the University of Washington"
13:43;13:45;"patented the Glacier Cherry,"
13:45;13:47;"does that mean they're making big..."
13:47;13:49;"Major bank off this Gatorade?"
13:49;13:50;"Mint."
13:50;13:51;"Wait, didn't Gatorade come"
13:51;13:53;"from the University of Florida too?"
13:53;13:56;"This is an extremely collegiate drink."
13:56;13:58;"If you want to support"
13:58;14:00;"two of the great public institutions"
14:00;14:01;"of higher learning in America,"
14:01;14:03;"University of Florida"
14:03;14:04;"and Washington State,"
14:04;14:07;"drink a Glacier Cherry Gatorade."
15:21;15:22;"Actually, I'm surprised"
15:22;15:23;"we never got into this."
15:23;15:25;"Is the University of Florida"
15:25;15:27;"making bank off Gatorade?"
15:27;15:28;"That's a great question."
15:28;15:31;"I gotta think at this point,"
15:31;15:32;"it's, you know, run by some huge..."
15:32;15:35;"beverage conglomerate."
15:35;15:37;"Like they must have bought them out years ago."
15:37;15:40;"I'm gonna guess that."
15:40;15:41;"I think that was developed"
15:41;15:42;"for like the football team"
15:42;15:43;"because those crazy like..."
15:43;15:47;"practicing in that Florida humidity"
15:47;15:47;"in the summer."
15:47;15:50;"Gotta replenish those electrolytes, boys."
15:50;15:52;"I'm not sure how,"
15:52;15:54;"but it does say here"
15:54;15:55;"that Gatorade has brought"
15:55;15:57;"more than $80 million"
15:57;15:58;"to the University of Florida."
15:58;16:00;"Yeah, I mean, even if they're just getting"
16:00;16:01;"like 1% or something,"
16:01;16:03;"that's pretty good."
16:03;16:04;"So how much money"
16:04;16:05;"has the Glacier Cherry made"
16:05;16:08;"for the University of Washington?"
16:08;16:09;"It's correct in the books."
16:09;16:09;"Unclear."
16:09;16:12;"We gotta get Seinfeld on those numbers."
16:12;16:13;"So it's Gatorade"
16:13;16:15;"because of the Gator football team?"
16:15;16:15;"Yeah."
16:15;16:16;"Because of the Gators."
16:16;16:16;"All right."
16:16;16:17;"Yeah."
16:17;16:19;"We haven't talked about this?"
16:19;16:20;"On the show?"
16:20;16:22;"I'm sure that part's..."
16:22;16:24;"I'm sure it's come up before."
16:24;16:26;"But Jake, what drew you to Glacier Cherry"
16:26;16:28;"in your time of need?"
16:28;16:29;"I think the appearance of it."
16:29;16:31;"It is the sort of like"
16:31;16:32;"very neutral,"
16:32;16:33;"almost kind of dishwater looking."
16:33;16:37;"When you put it that way,"
16:37;16:38;"it doesn't sound that appealing."
16:38;16:40;"It doesn't sound that good, does it?"
16:40;16:41;"Is it the milkiness?"
16:41;16:43;"I think it's the milkiness."
16:43;16:45;"It doesn't have like an obvious..."
16:45;16:47;"It's the milk of human kindness."
16:47;16:48;"Yeah, something..."
16:48;16:50;"I mean, I've never been a fan of like"
16:50;16:51;"that sort of like"
16:51;16:52;"engine coolant blue,"
16:52;16:55;"that flavor that's really like a popular one."
16:55;16:58;"I've always been a classic lemon lime,"
16:58;16:58;"you know, but I just..."
16:58;17:01;"That felt like a little bit too acidic"
17:01;17:05;"and it was a little too"
17:05;17:09;"souped up for my situation."
17:09;17:10;"Yeah, so then maybe the milkiness"
17:10;17:12;"seemed kind of..."
17:12;17:14;"I'm in sort of a vulnerable spot right now."
17:14;17:15;"So I needed..."
17:15;17:15;"Yeah."
17:15;17:17;"Just kind of a more mellow Gatorade."
17:17;17:18;"And I've been drinking it"
17:18;17:20;"with a lot of ice."
17:20;17:21;"Let the ice kind of melt."
17:22;17:25;"Kind of chill the Gatorade out a little bit."
17:25;17:25;"Dilute it."
17:25;17:27;"Melting Glacier."
17:27;17:29;"Melting Glacier Cherry."
17:29;17:31;"Melting Glacier would be like the cocktail version"
17:31;17:33;"that actually does have tequila."
17:33;17:36;"You put one of those giant ice cubes"
17:36;17:39;"they have at like artisanal cocktail bars"
17:39;17:42;"and watch it melt into a glass filled"
17:42;17:44;"with Glacier Cherry Gatorade,"
17:44;17:47;"tequila and I don't know,"
17:47;17:50;"some Angostura."
17:51;17:52;"Something feels very..."
17:52;17:54;"I think like a weird dystopian cocktail"
17:54;17:56;"where they have like those huge ice cubes,"
17:56;17:57;"but they're actually like..."
17:57;18:01;"This is actually from a glacier in Antarctica."
18:01;18:03;"Right."
18:03;18:07;"True like 0.1% like billion stuff."
18:07;18:08;"I thought you were going to say"
18:08;18:11;"the ice cube is a giant Gatorade."
18:11;18:12;"Oh, that'd be cool too."
18:12;18:16;"Wait, are you talking about the Icelandic water"
18:16;18:18;"that's the bottle is shaped like a mountain?"
18:18;18:20;"And it's very expensive."
18:20;18:21;"No, not that one."
18:21;18:25;"No, no, but that seems like a solid water."
18:25;18:27;"I think we uncovered something very interesting"
18:27;18:29;"that Glacier Cherry Gatorade"
18:29;18:31;"is probably one of the only"
18:31;18:34;"mainstream beverages on the market"
18:34;18:38;"which shares proceeds with two public universities."
18:38;18:39;"I find that fascinating."
18:39;18:43;"There must be all sorts of other weird stuff like that,"
18:43;18:46;"like some kind of technology developed at a school"
18:46;18:48;"that then gets used in..."
18:49;18:50;"Military application."
18:50;18:52;"Yeah, or computers."
18:52;18:54;"Yeah, how about that Seinfeld?"
18:54;18:55;"Let's see if you can find anything just like"
18:55;19:01;"schools that own extremely lucrative patents."
19:01;19:04;"I wonder if it was like a team that developed Gatorade"
19:04;19:06;"or it might've just been one dude."
19:06;19:10;"I'm honestly surprised it was not like some HBO movie"
19:10;19:12;"about like the creation of Gatorade."
19:12;19:16;"That's Jerry Seinfeld's next film for Netflix."
19:18;19:20;"Or that's our version of his ""Unfrosted"""
19:20;19:22;"which I don't know if we ever talked about on the show,"
19:22;19:23;"but if you haven't seen it,"
19:23;19:27;"that's Jerry Seinfeld's highly zany satirical"
19:27;19:35;"take on the true story of the toaster cake wars"
19:35;19:38;"between Kellogg's and Post."
19:38;19:40;"So it's basically about the development"
19:40;19:42;"of the Pop-Tart in the '60s."
19:42;19:44;"Yeah, it could be something about like Gatorade"
19:44;19:45;"versus Powerade."
19:45;19:47;"I could see it being kind of a cool movie"
19:48;19:50;"like if it was, yeah, just sort of like that."
19:50;19:51;"If you really get the, like,"
19:51;19:55;"you capture the time and place of like early '80s"
19:55;19:57;"college football in Florida."
19:57;20:00;"Well, I think it's more like '60s, isn't it?"
20:00;20:01;"Oh, is it?"
20:01;20:02;"Okay, well, here we go."
20:02;20:03;"Yeah, what do we got?"
20:03;20:05;"Oh, we got an article here from Forbes,"
20:05;20:08;"top patent revenue generating universities."
20:08;20:11;"A lot of pharmaceuticals,"
20:11;20:16;"mostly pharmaceuticals is what I'd tell you right here."
20:17;20:17;"Number one."
20:17;20:18;"Oh, really?"
20:18;20:21;"I thought it was gonna be mostly beverages."
20:21;20:22;"That's disappointing, but go on."
20:22;20:23;"Very low on the Bev."
20:23;20:27;"Number one, New York University,"
20:27;20:30;"Remicade, a rheumatoid arthritis drug"
20:30;20:35;"brings in hundreds of millions a year for NYU."
20:35;20:36;"Really?"
20:36;20:37;"That's funny 'cause isn't that famously"
20:37;20:40;"one of like the most expensive school in America?"
20:40;20:42;"It's up there."
20:42;20:45;"Where's all that Remicade money going NYU?"
20:45;20:48;"I guess that's why they buy all that expensive real estate."
20:48;20:51;"How about number two, Wake Forest University?"
20:51;20:53;"Cashing in on that."
20:53;20:56;"Kinetic Technologies virtual endoscopy machine,"
20:56;21:00;"licensed to GE Medical, a unit of General Electric."
21:00;21:04;"Wake Forest is like, is a big name in college sports."
21:04;21:05;"I feel like I always hear it."
21:05;21:09;"So somewhere there's definitely somebody who hates them"
21:09;21:12;"and roots for their rival and has to get a virtual endoscopy."
21:12;21:16;"Some UNC fan is just pulling a gasket."
21:16;21:20;"Just a hardcore football fan from Chapel Hill willing to die."
21:20;21:22;"You gotta do your research folks."
21:22;21:27;"If you're a college sports nut, you have no idea"
21:27;21:30;"what kind of money you're putting out to your enemies"
21:30;21:32;"just in day-to-day life."
21:32;21:34;"What's number three on that list?"
21:34;21:35;"This is actually more interesting"
21:35;21:36;"than I thought it was gonna be."
21:36;21:39;"Well, Jake, you know all about HydroGlobe, right?"
21:39;21:41;"Which removes lead and arsenic from water."
21:42;21:43;"Okay, you're gonna love this."
21:43;21:44;"Use it every day."
21:44;21:45;"You're gonna love this."
21:45;21:49;"It was sold to Graver Technologies, a filtration manufacturer."
21:49;21:54;"And next year, let me check the date of this article."
21:54;21:58;"Oh, it's from 2008."
21:58;22:02;"This article may be more than 15 years old."
22:02;22:07;"It takes so many years to patent something."
22:07;22:10;"I feel like as far as we're concerned, this is current."
22:10;22:14;"Okay, but what's the upshot with this HydroGlobe technology?"
22:14;22:19;"Well, in '09, it was on track to make $50 million just that year."
22:19;22:20;"Wait, for what university?"
22:20;22:24;"Oh, that was from the Stevens Institute of Technology."
22:24;22:25;"Where's that?"
22:25;22:26;"Is that in New Jersey?"
22:26;22:30;"Stevens Institute."
22:30;22:32;"That's actually in Hoboken, yeah."
22:32;22:34;"I knew it."
22:34;22:35;"Nailed it."
22:35;22:36;"You can't get Jersey facts past me."
22:37;22:42;"All right, everybody, keep removing that lead and arsenic from your water"
22:42;22:45;"and send those sweet dollars back to Hoboken."
22:45;22:47;"The numbers are crazy though."
22:47;22:49;"That's a real game changer."
22:49;22:56;"You know, and also, you think about how much people talk about the emphasis on sports"
22:56;22:57;"and some people are like, ""You know what?"
22:57;22:59;"There's too much emphasis on sports at the college level."""
22:59;23:02;"And then people say, ""You know how much money that brings in for the school?"""
23:03;23:07;"Next time somebody says that, I got one word for you."
23:07;23:08;"Remicade."
23:08;23:10;"Oh, virtual..."
23:10;23:14;"And virtual endoscopy."
23:14;23:16;"I got one word for you."
23:16;23:19;"I got one, two words for you."
23:19;23:21;"I got one, two word phrase for you."
23:21;23:24;"Virtual endoscopy."
23:25;23:30;"I remember the 35 sweet goodbyes"
23:30;23:36;"When you put me on the Wolverine of Duane and Dare"
23:36;23:42;"It was still September"
23:42;23:45;"When your daddy was quite surprised"
23:45;23:51;"To find you with the working girls in the county jail"
23:52;23:58;"I was smoking with the boys upstairs"
23:58;24:01;"When I heard about the whole affair"
24:01;24:07;"I said, ""Whoa, no, William and Mary won't do that"""
24:07;24:13;"Well, I did not think the girl could be so cruel"
24:16;24:22;"And I'm never going back to my old school"
24:22;24:33;"It's also funny because NYU is famously the least athletic major school in America."
24:33;24:40;"Because even the Ivy League schools do have a real sports tradition."
24:41;24:48;"Even at the schools like Harvard and Yale, which are famous, have these..."
24:48;24:54;"For lack of a better word, super nerds go there."
24:54;24:57;"Even they have these famous football games and this and that."
24:57;24:59;"NYU, no football team."
24:59;25:02;"Downtown Manhattan, just not a sports school."
25:02;25:08;"And I do find this very interesting that if anybody is ever like,"
25:08;25:10;"""Oh yeah, NYU, no school spirit."
25:10;25:13;"They don't have a football team to rally behind or get excited about."""
25:13;25:15;"It's like, ""Yeah, they have something else to get excited about."
25:15;25:16;"Ramacade."""
25:16;25:21;"And it makes more money than the whole f*** Crimson Tide."
25:21;25:26;"So for all you college sports fans, look into pharmaceuticals."
25:26;25:28;"I'm a college pharmaceuticals fan."
25:28;25:30;"Get off the field and into the lab, fellas."
25:30;25:33;"I'm a fan of that real estate portfolio."
25:33;25:34;"Yeah."
25:34;25:39;"There's going to be a fugitive style thing where there's some weird..."
25:40;25:44;"Corruption and murders happening around NYU."
25:44;25:49;"And they discover that all the proceeds from Ramacade"
25:49;25:52;"are being funneled into real estate deals in Manhattan."
25:52;25:54;"Oh, it's very John Grisham."
25:54;25:57;"Ramacade is such a perfect name for a movie like that."
25:57;26:01;"Just like somebody's dying and is just like, ""Tell me, what is it?"""
26:01;26:03;"And the guy's just like, ""Ramacade."""
26:03;26:06;"""Ramacade."""
26:06;26:09;"You can picture a movie where people throughout the whole movie are just going..."
26:09;26:14;"Just flipping through like a thousand page dossier and it's just ""Ramacade."""
26:14;26:15;"""Ramacade."""
26:15;26:17;"All this says so much ""Ramacade."""
26:17;26:18;"It was Ramacade the whole time."
26:18;26:24;"The art department would have a lot of fun designing that Ramacade vial."
26:24;26:25;"Don't you think?"
26:25;26:29;"The Ramacade vial that dramatically falls in slow motion and shatters on the ground at one point."
26:29;26:31;"Ramacade."
26:31;26:32;"It wasn't Benzedrine."
26:32;26:32;"It was Ramacade."
26:32;26:34;"It was Ramacade the whole time."
26:34;26:36;"Wait, wait."
26:36;26:38;"Actually, maybe I glossed over this before."
26:38;26:39;"What's Ramacade for?"
26:39;26:41;"Rheumatoid arthritis."
26:41;26:42;"Perfect."
26:42;26:46;"So like the Michael Clayton character or whatever,"
26:46;26:51;"be visiting a really old person who's just like can't write or type."
26:51;26:53;"And you know, it's like, there's somebody who's involved in the labs."
26:53;26:55;"It's an old professor."
26:55;26:57;"Yes."
26:57;26:57;"Forget it, Jake."
26:57;26:58;"It's Ramacade."
26:58;27:05;"I've been scrolling down this list and I got to number eight."
27:05;27:06;"And you're going to love this."
27:06;27:09;"It's the University of Florida with Gatorade."
27:09;27:10;"Right in the mix."
27:10;27:11;"Number eight."
27:11;27:12;"Great."
27:12;27:13;"Top 10."
27:13;27:14;"How much are they pulling in a year?"
27:14;27:15;"2008."
27:15;27:17;"Doesn't say."
27:17;27:21;"Oh, well, it looks like it's in the $40 million range."
27:21;27:22;"Per year?"
27:22;27:24;"Nothing to sneeze at."
27:24;27:26;"Yeah, that was in '06."
27:26;27:28;"Oh, wait a second, though."
27:28;27:35;"They're also spending $450 million on research across the board."
27:35;27:35;"For Gatorade?"
27:36;27:38;"For all research at the university."
27:38;27:42;"So I don't think this is a net."
27:42;27:44;"This is not a net profit situation for."
27:44;27:45;"Yeah, I don't like that."
27:45;27:46;"I don't like that."
27:46;27:48;"You got to know when to hold them and know when to fold them."
27:48;27:50;"University of Florida, you got a good thing going."
27:50;27:53;"$40 million a year to spend all research."
27:53;27:56;"I know you think you're going to find another Gatorade,"
27:56;27:58;"but that might be a once a century kind of thing."
27:58;28:03;"Close down all of your research departments, shut down the labs,"
28:03;28:04;"and just let that money flow in."
28:05;28:09;"And you can have more ice cream socials for the students,"
28:09;28:15;"multiple shows every semester with really weird bills."
28:15;28:18;"Yo, Gatorade campaign."
28:18;28:23;"Gatorade wipes out all student debt just at the University of Florida."
28:23;28:25;"Think about that."
28:25;28:30;"Meaning that nobody goes into debt who goes to the University of Florida."
28:30;28:31;"There's no student loans."
28:32;28:36;"Retroactively, any alumni of the University of Florida who owns student debt,"
28:36;28:38;"Gatorade wipes it out."
28:38;28:42;"And they put that into a big marketing spot that airs during the Super Bowl."
28:42;28:43;"That's sweet."
28:43;28:44;"That's tight."
28:44;28:45;"Thank you."
28:45;28:47;"I don't know if NYU is doing that with Remicade."
28:47;28:50;"An underscore share."
28:50;28:53;"Gatorade 1965."
28:53;28:56;"Yeah, because it was just a powder at first."
28:56;28:58;"When you picture the powder, it's way more 60s."
28:58;28:58;"Like Tang."
28:58;29:00;"Space age."
29:00;29:01;"Yeah."
29:01;29:05;"So an undisclosed share of the Gatorade profits flow to a Gatorade trust."
29:05;29:10;"And that trust then shares 20% of the profits to the university."
29:10;29:13;"But, you know, redacted."
29:13;29:14;"The Gatorade trust."
29:14;29:18;"Well, maybe now is not the time, but we'll do some research one of these days,"
29:18;29:20;"because I'm curious about it too."
29:20;29:24;"Obviously, the research came out of the university, but was it a whole team?"
29:24;29:26;"Was it a, you know, a decades long?"
29:26;29:27;"It was a professor."
29:27;29:30;"It employed the professor who invented the drink."
29:30;29:31;"I mean, this is one guy."
29:31;29:32;"So what does he get?"
29:32;29:34;"What's his name?"
29:34;29:36;"Let me find his name."
29:36;29:39;"I have a feeling this is one of those situations."
29:39;29:44;"I've been in this situation where you just do not own any of the IP"
29:44;29:47;"because you were employed by a larger company."
29:47;29:51;"I think he took security over risk."
29:51;29:53;"And so I bet he sees none of it."
29:53;29:55;"You would help develop a sports drink, Nick?"
29:55;29:57;"I'm like my friend, Robert Cade."
29:58;30:05;"At born in San Antonio in 1927, inventor of Gatorade."
30:05;30:09;"So, oh, so the aid comes from his name, Cade."
30:09;30:11;"Interesting."
30:11;30:14;"I think it's meant to aid the Florida Gators."
30:14;30:19;"Yes, but it has more than a coincidence."
30:19;30:21;"His name is Cade."
30:21;30:23;"But it's spelled A-D-E like in his name."
30:23;30:24;"Last name is C-A-D-E."
30:24;30:25;"Yes."
30:25;30:25;"Oh, yeah."
30:25;30:26;"Good call."
30:26;30:27;"It's not Gator A-I-D."
30:28;30:30;"God, imagine you're that guy or his family."
30:30;30:35;"And well, let's try to do some research about how much he got paid."
30:35;30:38;"But also, you helped create a new suffix."
30:38;30:42;"So then you see the Coca-Cola company invents Powerade."
30:42;30:47;"And you know that damn well that that came in a sense from your own your family name."
30:47;30:52;"Your family who worked the mean streets of San Antonio,"
30:52;30:57;"who toiled the hard earth of Texas for centuries."
30:57;31:02;"And you invent something amazing that has an influence all around the world"
31:02;31:04;"and even sparks other products."
31:04;31:06;"He led a research team."
31:06;31:07;"It wasn't just him."
31:07;31:11;"But I mean, I feel like he's it's his product."
31:12;31:16;"My mouth is red from day to day."
31:16;31:20;"I wish that I could make a trade."
31:20;31:22;"The sun is hot."
31:22;31:29;"I try not to see my friends with clocks for heads."
31:29;31:35;"Makes me think about it more instead."
31:38;31:42;"Everybody's reaching out to me."
31:42;31:51;"Everybody's reaching out to me."
31:51;31:55;"Well, I heard actually he took a lot of the credit for it."
31:55;32:01;"There was actually a janitor at the University of Florida who came up with a fundamental idea."
32:01;32:02;"The marketing team."
32:02;32:05;"His name was Richard Montanez."
32:05;32:12;"Yeah, this is a good transition because there's a major TC story out there in the world right now."
32:12;32:17;"And it has to do with this idea of A) working for a larger company."
32:17;32:18;"You help out with something."
32:18;32:23;"But you know, not everybody is going to always have equity."
32:23;32:26;"And even this idea of like, well, who invented a product?"
32:26;32:30;"Can it really be one person who took the credit?"
32:30;32:34;"Or is it sometimes something more boring like a whole team?"
32:34;32:36;"Like maybe a guy's running a team or something."
32:36;32:38;"Which actually kind of makes you think about Oppenheimer too."
32:38;32:41;"He was running a team, but he's..."
32:41;32:44;"They named the movie after him."
32:44;32:45;"Not any of those other dudes."
32:45;32:50;"I wonder if any of those guys, if they were alive today, would just be like,"
32:50;32:52;"""You call the movie Oppenheimer?"
32:52;32:53;"Come on."""
32:53;32:59;"Like, you know, like the Scotty Pippen of the atomic bomb just being like, ""We were a team, man."""
32:59;33:04;"I love that connection you're drawing between Flamin' Hot Cheetos and the atomic bomb."
33:04;33:09;"Just amazing American inventions."
33:09;33:10;"The atomic bomb."
33:10;33:15;"Oppenheimer and his research team."
33:15;33:19;"And in the middle of that, in the days between, Gatorade."
33:19;33:23;"I mean, both the bomb and the chips, they're both Flamin' Hot."
33:23;33:27;"Arguably, both very spicy in their own ways."
33:27;33:29;"That's right."
33:29;33:30;"That's one way to put it."
33:30;33:32;"Oppenheimer, at first, he just wanted to..."
33:32;33:35;"They said, ""What do you want to call it?"""
33:35;33:36;"And he's like, ""It's just a bomb."""
33:36;33:40;"And they said, ""Yeah, but it's like something special about this bomb."
33:40;33:41;"It's not just any bomb."
33:41;33:42;"It's a new kind of bomb."""
33:42;33:46;"And he said, ""Yeah, just Flamin' Hot bomb?"
33:46;33:48;"Spicy bomb?"""
33:48;33:57;"What's the scene in Flamin' Hot where they keep trying the different Cheetos with the sun,"
33:57;33:59;"and he's finally like, ""Bad spicy."""
33:59;33:59;"Oh, yeah."
33:59;34:00;"It's that runner."
34:00;34:02;"Yeah, and they go, ""Good or bad spicy?"
34:02;34:04;"Good spicy or bad spicy?"""
34:04;34:06;"""Good spicy."""
34:06;34:08;"Scene like that in Oppenheimer would have been nice."
34:08;34:09;"Well, yeah."
34:09;34:11;"What about cool?"
34:11;34:12;"What about cool when they're testing the weapon?"
34:12;34:16;"Just at Los Alamos, they finally..."
34:16;34:22;"The first successful nuclear detonation just cuts to Benny Safdie with the sunglasses"
34:22;34:24;"and the sunscreen on his face."
34:24;34:26;"And he just goes, ""Good spicy."""
34:26;34:27;"""Good spicy."""
34:27;34:33;"Just Cheetos dust all over the goggles for some reason."
34:33;34:38;"Now that's what I call good spicy."
34:38;34:40;"This is also like..."
34:40;34:46;"We were about to talk about something so uniquely current for TC, the Montañez lawsuit,"
34:46;34:51;"and yet now we're talking about a movie so associated with last summer."
34:51;34:54;"But we never did an Oppenheimer rundown on this."
34:54;35:00;"I guess it's understood that Oppenheimer was the team leader, and he did have a dream team."
35:00;35:03;"But it makes sense to focus on him."
35:03;35:09;"And I guess also the movie is not just about the development of the atomic bomb."
35:09;35:10;"It's also about what happened to him after."
35:10;35:15;"So it makes sense to call the movie Oppenheimer."
35:15;35:18;"Yeah, I was okay with it being called Oppenheimer."
35:18;35:19;"""Remicade."""
35:19;35:21;"It's interesting."
35:21;35:24;"Gatorade and ""Remicade"" could be a good song."
35:24;35:29;"Circling back to that, I'm just picturing all those luxury condos in Tribeca that are"
35:29;35:33;"sitting empty because it's all part of the ""Remicade"" scam."
35:33;35:34;"Right."
35:34;35:38;"All these leases are made out to ""Remicade."""
35:38;35:39;"Yeah."
35:39;35:41;"Okay, wait, let's..."
35:41;35:41;"Hold on."
35:41;35:42;"We're all over the place."
35:42;35:44;"This is a mess of an episode."
35:44;35:47;"Let's drill down on Montañez."
35:47;35:48;"Okay."
35:49;35:51;"So, I mean, we almost had a perfect segue."
35:51;35:56;"So if you haven't heard, major, major news."
35:56;36:01;"This is a story that we've been covering doggedly for years."
36:01;36:07;"I mean, I feel like Jake first brought up this story about Flaminato Cheetos years before"
36:07;36:08;"the movie."
36:08;36:12;"I just remember Jake simply saying, ""Did you know that the Flaminato Cheetos were invented"
36:12;36:14;"by a janitor at Frito-Lay?"""
36:14;36:15;"We love the story."
36:15;36:17;"We love Montañez."
36:17;36:19;"We talked about him."
36:19;36:20;"We were excited for the movie."
36:20;36:28;"But right around the time the movie was coming out, the LA Times wrote a piece basically"
36:28;36:34;"trying to say that Montañez was telling a bit of a tall tale and that Flaminato Cheetos"
36:34;36:39;"was developed by a team at Frito-Lay and he wasn't particularly involved in the development,"
36:39;36:44;"but he still was a beloved icon of Hispanic marketing."
36:44;36:48;"And Frito-Lay didn't really have anything bad to say about him."
36:48;36:52;"They just put out a statement saying something along the lines of, ""Oh, we love Richard."
36:52;36:57;"That's not exactly how it went down, but he's a great dude."""
36:57;37:00;"Nothing in our records indicate his involvement."
37:00;37:06;"Yeah, they said something about as nice as they could, considering that they were basically"
37:06;37:07;"calling him a liar."
37:07;37:10;"But so whatever, Frito-Lay wasn't taking him down."
37:10;37:14;"But of course, he still felt the heat, no pun intended."
37:14;37:21;"And we talked about the fact on this show that the Biden White House hosted a screening"
37:21;37:25;"of Flamin' Hot and they invited the stars of the film."
37:25;37:30;"They invited Eva Longoria, who directed it, but they didn't invite Richard Montañez,"
37:30;37:34;"which I can't remember where we fell on it last time we talked about it."
37:34;37:38;"But as I think about it now, I kind of feel like either invite Montañez or don't show"
37:38;37:39;"the movie."
37:39;37:40;"How about that?"
37:40;37:41;"Check it out."
37:41;37:45;"Oh, you got places to go"
37:45;37:47;"You're not going this slow"
37:47;37:50;"Oh, no, no, no, no, no"
37:50;37:54;"They will tell you you're crazy"
37:54;37:55;"They will call you a fool"
37:55;37:58;"They will think they can stop you"
37:58;38:00;"But there's no stopping you"
38:00;38:06;"They can't put out what you got inside you"
38:06;38:10;"No way to put out that flame"
38:10;38:13;"Nothing can hold you back"
38:13;38:14;"No one can kill you back"
38:14;38:19;"When you got the fire inside"
38:19;38:21;"When you got the fire inside"
38:21;38:25;"And oh, you're gonna own this life"
38:25;38:29;"'Cause you got the fire inside"
38:29;38:32;"'Cause you got the fire, you got the fire"
38:34;38:40;"My theory on this is that Montañez is a bit of a loose cannon and potential,"
38:40;38:45;"not PR, potential PR issue for that film."
38:45;38:51;"Bringing him along for these events may have changed the narrative that they were trying"
38:51;38:53;"to put out there. That's just my theory."
38:53;38:54;"Yet he's in the movie."
38:54;38:57;"Wait, how though? Like what could he possibly say?"
38:57;39:03;"So don't get him on the mic, but this is one way or another, this movie is his story."
39:04;39:08;"I'm not gonna say it's a true story, but it's his story."
39:08;39:12;"Let him come to the White House, let him take a picture with Joe and Jill,"
39:12;39:15;"and you know, you don't have to let him on the mic, but like,"
39:15;39:20;"I just think, yeah, don't show the movie if you're not gonna invite Montañez."
39:20;39:25;"But anyway, this all happened a couple years ago, and now, on July 18th,"
39:25;39:28;"this is the most current we've ever been on this show,"
39:28;39:31;"Richard Montañez has filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo,"
39:31;39:36;"which of course is Frito-Lay's parent company, accusing the corporation of orchestrating"
39:36;39:37;"a smear campaign against him."
39:37;39:43;"The complaint claims Montañez was the victim of fraud, racial discrimination,"
39:43;39:47;"defamation, and violations of California's unfair competition law."
39:47;39:53;"By rejecting the claims that he invented the Flamin' Hot Cheetos in 1992,"
39:53;40:00;"the company has damaged Montañez's mental health and livelihood by causing unwarranted distrust."
40:00;40:04;"The complaint says, it continues, ""Defendants' false statements concerning Mr. Montañez have"
40:04;40:10;"made the public and potential business partners distrustful of him and his narrative."
40:10;40:14;"His livelihood and mental health have directly suffered as a result."""
40:14;40:20;"So, you know, Montañez hasn't worked at Frito-Lay in a while, but he was making real money"
40:20;40:25;"selling his books and doing a lot of public speaking engagements,"
40:25;40:31;"because you can only imagine what a killer kind of company retreat that might be."
40:31;40:36;"You know, you work for, you know, Dunder Mifflin or some sh*t, and then you go out to the company"
40:36;40:41;"retreat and it's like, ""Now, we want to talk to you. We want you lower-level employees to realize"
40:41;40:43;"that, you know, nothing is impossible."""
40:43;40:48;"And here's a story from a guy who went from a janitor to the inventor of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
40:48;40:53;"Crowd goes wild, gets everybody pumped up. They go back to their"
40:53;41:00;"job full of vim and vigor. I'm sure he was an incredible speaker. I remember checking out his"
41:00;41:08;"social media and he always had kind of fun little phrases and, you know, he's kind of had a magnetic"
41:08;41:15;"personality. So he was probably traveling the country, maybe the world, talking about his story."
41:15;41:22;"According to the lawsuit, his speaking engagements have dwindled from like 80 to 4."
41:22;41:25;"So it definitely affected his livelihood. And here's what Montanez said himself."
41:25;41:32;"""I created Flamin' Hot Cheetos not only as a product, but as a movement. And as a loyal"
41:32;41:38;"executive for PepsiCo, PepsiCo believed in me as a leader because they knew people would follow me."
41:38;41:43;"And they did because they knew my soul is my community. We built this into a $2 billion"
41:43;41:48;"industry and I cannot let them take away my legacy or destroy my reputation. I will not"
41:48;41:50;"let them silence me."""
41:50;41:51;"What do we think, guys? This is-"
41:51;41:56;"Frito-Lay previously said that none of their records show that Montanez was involved in any"
41:56;42:03;"capacity in the Flamin' Hot test market. According to a 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation,"
42:03;42:09;"they added, ""That doesn't mean we don't celebrate Richard, but the facts do not support the urban"
42:09;42:16;"legend."" Now, I wonder what is in it for them to like go up, kind of correct the record."
42:16;42:20;"They were responding to the LA Times article, so they probably felt like they had to say"
42:20;42:24;"something. So they, I'm sure they had a meeting. Yeah."
42:24;42:26;"So the LA Times went digging."
42:26;42:28;"Yes."
42:28;42:36;"And they, they uncovered the story that all was not well in the narrative of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
42:36;42:40;"Yeah. And they, you know, and they went and interviewed people who claimed to be on the"
42:40;42:47;"team that developed them, which I seem to recall was like Chicago based. So it wasn't even like"
42:47;42:54;"a story of like two people at the same factory and one, and you know, they're saying, ""No, no,"
42:54;42:57;"no. That was my idea. You were there."" But these people were saying like, ""No, no, we were literally"
42:57;43:01;"in a different part of the country developing this. We have documentation about what we were"
43:01;43:08;"working on. We didn't even know him."" So, you know, and I, as I recall in that, in the LA Times"
43:08;43:14;"article, some of those people seemed a little bit annoyed about it because they felt like, ""No,"
43:14;43:20;"I was on the team that did it."" So yeah, LA Times went digging. They, that's what they found. So"
43:20;43:25;"you imagine that when Frito-Lay made this statement, the one that you just read, they were"
43:25;43:30;"really trying to thread a difficult needle. Right."
43:30;43:37;"You know, because they, they recognize that Montaigne's is out there telling a story. And"
43:37;43:45;"also a major part of this too, is the fact that that product was developed and targeted"
43:45;43:49;"at the Hispanic community. He's telling a story they want told."
43:49;43:53;"Yeah, exactly. This has been my theory from day one."
43:53;43:55;"Frito-Lay wishes it was true. Yes."
43:55;44:00;"But then they don't want to lie either and say like, ""No, no, this iconic product, which helped,"
44:01;44:07;"you know, help us expand into the Hispanic marketplace and make us billions of dollars."
44:07;44:11;"It was actually developed by a team of non-Hispanic people in Chicago."""
44:11;44:15;"Yeah. In the lab."
44:15;44:16;"Yeah. PhDs in chemistry."
44:16;44:18;"No good spicy. This is..."
44:18;44:22;"That's bad. That's what I call bad spicy."
44:23;44:23;"What they do?"
44:24;44:26;"It's not in your face."
44:26;44:29;"All the time they want to take your place, the backstabbers."
44:29;44:31;"Backstabbers."
44:31;44:33;"It's not in your face."
44:33;44:37;"All the time they want to take your place, the backstabbers."
44:37;44:39;"Backstabbers."
44:39;44:46;"All you fellas who have someone and you really care. Yeah. Yeah."
44:46;44:52;"Then it's all in your feathers. Better beware. Yeah. Yeah."
44:53;44:58;"Yeah. It's a mess. It's a mess. And I sort of wish that the LA Times guy just had"
44:58;45:04;"left this one alone. This was a stone that I don't think needed to be unchurned."
45:04;45:12;"Yeah. This was a real woodward and Bernstein level investigation this guy did."
45:12;45:17;"I mean, I wonder what the impetus of it was. I mean, we covered this years ago,"
45:17;45:19;"so I don't remember when that article dropped."
45:19;45:25;"Yeah. I can't remember actually. And I feel like we know somebody who knows him. I mean, look,"
45:25;45:29;"the guys, I think this guy's a respected journalist and stuff. So he probably just"
45:29;45:38;"saw, I'm sure he wasn't trying to ruin Montaigne's speaking engagement. Who knows? Maybe he just"
45:38;45:41;"talked to some of those people and he was just, he was just curious. What's the truth here?"
45:41;45:48;"Obviously there's a disagreement. So I'm not gonna, not gonna diss the journalist."
45:49;45:52;"I mean, it sounds like the truth is for us to make up our minds, we're going to have to"
45:52;45:58;"pour over hundreds of pages, if not thousands of pages of internal, uh, free to lay documents,"
45:58;46:05;"because that's the only way that we can, we can actually know what's going on here. And then also"
46:05;46:11;"like, we have filed a FOIA request on behalf of the show. Haven't, haven't we for this?"
46:11;46:16;"No, we should, we're going to get to get the octopus murders guys to help us."
46:16;46:21;"Right. But maybe, maybe we don't want to go any deeper than this. I mean, yeah,"
46:21;46:25;"you got to feel for everybody. We also, I believe Jake, the last time we talked about it,"
46:25;46:34;"you suggested that perhaps this was an emotional truth for Montaigne's and, you know, he,"
46:34;46:38;"cause, cause one thing I said this last time, and I'll say it again. The one thing that's a"
46:38;46:45;"hundred percent true about Montaigne's is that he came from a working class immigrant family"
46:46;46:53;"and went from being a janitor at a company to a high level marketing executive. That's true."
46:53;46:58;"That's undisputed. That's undisputed. And that in, in and of itself is a rare story."
46:58;47:03;"It is a story worth celebrating. I'm sure everybody at Frito-Lay would agree. That's"
47:03;47:11;"a story worth celebrating. It just doesn't have that perfect, uh, tagline elevator pitch,"
47:11;47:18;"a janitor created Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Like that's what like, you know, that's what takes a"
47:18;47:24;"kind of good story that probably requires, you know, a long explanation and turns it into a"
47:24;47:31;"soundbite. And if in fact, you know, the, the LA Times reporting is correct, we can forgive"
47:31;47:38;"Montaigne's for maybe over the years, simplifying his own story into something punchy. I just have"
47:38;47:44;"this feeling like there's a really good courtroom drama type movie here in a sequel to this thing,"
47:44;47:51;"but I know that there, follow me on this, that he was on just, there's no dispute that he was the"
47:51;47:57;"head of marketing, right? Well, not that part is true. No, I not, I'm again, this is a timeline"
47:57;48:02;"situation and chronology we'll figure out. But I think there's a version where he is the head"
48:02;48:07;"and they're making this thing and it's a lab and the story and he's the head of marketing goes,"
48:07;48:12;"you know, it'd be the best story is what if I made it? Yeah. I mean, you just can't,"
48:12;48:19;"he has a story about building his own mythology into this to make it work culturally, to make it"
48:19;48:25;"work marketing wise. The stories that you tell yourselves become history. It's like when Brian"
48:25;48:32;"Williams thought he went to Iraq or whatever. Remember that famous story? Oh yeah. The journalist,"
48:32;48:38;"the, the like, very like erudite NBC journalist was like, yeah, Brian's. Yeah. They were shooting"
48:38;48:41;"at us. Oh yeah. He's like, he went to Iraq or Afghanistan. He was like, they were shooting"
48:41;48:45;"us. And then it was like, and then it was almost like, no, you were never even there, man."
48:45;48:55;"And he, I think he was legitimately like, Whoa, I love this. Like a sort of almost like adaptation."
48:55;48:58;"Like there's something about, yeah, the stories we tell ourselves. And he's like,"
48:58;49:03;"at some point has told so many people, this story, such a good story. And he's gone to some,"
49:03;49:08;"and then someone's like, but it's not, that's the story. Everyone also wants to believe."
49:08;49:12;"They've studied that with memory, even though, even, I guess, even with a fake memory,"
49:12;49:17;"like they've studied this with memories that like the ones, the memories that you replay the most"
49:17;49:23;"are like the most degraded. It's like a VHS tape that you keep playing over and over again. So"
49:23;49:27;"like, think about episodes in your life that you've thought about a lot and reflect on a lot."
49:27;49:33;"Those memories are likely like wildly, wildly off. Cause you've like reflected. And each time"
49:33;49:40;"you think about it, it sort of like degrades a little bit more. And then if you have like a"
49:40;49:44;"random memory about something you haven't thought about in years, you ever have that happen?"
49:44;49:48;"And it's like, and it's like, comes in a flash and you're like, Oh yeah. And it's like,"
49:48;49:49;"there's a, there's like a clarity to it."
49:49;49:50;"That's pure."
49:50;49:55;"Right. And that's especially crazy because if it's a memory that you return to often,"
49:55;50:01;"you would tend to think, well, this is one I can really count on because I think about it all the"
50:01;50:06;"time. It's, you know, so, so obviously it's more true, but what you're saying is the opposite."
50:06;50:10;"Which is, yeah, there was like a radio lab about that years ago that I remember like,"
50:10;50:12;"kind of like blew my mind."
50:12;50:18;"Yeah. I mean, I bet Montanye's get him on a lie detector test. He invented flaming hot Cheetos."
50:18;50:23;"That's what it's going to say. And I mean, to take Frito-Lay's side for a second,"
50:24;50:32;"they did not throw him too hard under the bus. They, a legitimate journalist wrote something,"
50:32;50:37;"did his research. They had to respond. And they said the nicest thing they possibly could say"
50:37;50:45;"about somebody who their records did not support. Somebody whose story the records did not support."
50:45;50:51;"So it's too bad that Montanye's, but I guess in his world. So like for us, I remember kind of"
50:51;50:55;"thing like, well, it's lame. They didn't invite him to the white house, but life goes on. They"
50:55;51:01;"made a hit movie based on his story. And it was even nominated for best song of the Oscars. Like"
51:01;51:07;"life is good. But I guess in month for Montanye's, it didn't feel that way. His speaking fees,"
51:07;51:15;"dwindle, et cetera. You know what? Because, because Biden did Montanye's so dirty by not"
51:15;51:19;"inviting him to the screening. He even just could have been invited as a guest."
51:19;51:22;"He's in the movie. He's in the movie. He acted in the film."
51:22;51:26;"Not invited him just to be like, yeah, as a, as talent in the movie."
51:26;51:30;"Even if his memories are not correct about inventing flame and hot Cheetos,"
51:30;51:36;"if you were him and you saw that the white house premiere of flame and hot Cheetos,"
51:36;51:46;"and you heard Biden, whatever he said about, you know, diversity and the Hispanic contribution"
51:46;51:50;"to American culture, you heard all that stuff. I can see you're sitting at home. You're, you're,"
51:50;51:57;"you're, you're, you're Montanye's and you're saying like, you're, you're using my story to sell"
51:57;52:03;"your vision of America and to tell the feel good. Like, how am I not invited to this?"
52:03;52:06;"You didn't invite me to a movie premiere because you said I didn't invite,"
52:06;52:11;"invent flaming hot Cheetos about a movie where I invented flaming hot Cheetos."
52:12;52:16;"Yeah, it's totally, it's, it's totally incoherent. And I think the only"
52:16;52:20;"correct thing, I don't know if, uh, if a president has this kind of power,"
52:20;52:25;"cause I think normally when a president pardoned somebody, it's because they were convicted of a"
52:25;52:31;"crime. I don't know if they're allowed to just do kind of presidential pardon. That's that basically"
52:31;52:37;"tells the country you have to believe this guy's story. I think it'd be kind of unprecedented,"
52:37;52:44;"but I think, uh, Biden on his way out should pardon in his last hundred days Montanye's and"
52:44;52:49;"give him lifetime immunity from, from people saying he didn't invent flaming hot Cheetos."
52:49;52:53;"I think it's the only right thing to do. I mean, they say that as far as the president's here"
52:53;52:59;"are constantly expanding. So I think this would be, you know, the next frontier for Joe."
52:59;53:03;"Oh, I like, I do like that the white house being able to say what the truth is"
53:04;53:08;"from now on. The truth is he invented flaming hot. Yeah. There's no problems with that."
53:08;53:13;"They're already doing that more or less in these, these, yeah. And in politics,"
53:13;53:19;"these lying politicians, it also be a shame in a high stakes election."
53:19;53:24;"When there's a lot of discussion about the Hispanic vote, people were very disturbed to see"
53:24;53:29;"that Trump had a higher share of the Hispanic vote than some previous Republican candidates."
53:29;53:36;"Well, remember this Biden, you took, you took a, you disrespected a great amount."
53:36;53:41;"As far as the democratic party is concerned, Richard Montanye's invented flaming hot Cheetos."
53:41;53:53;"Folks, Montanye, they treated him very bad. Didn't they folks? Ooh, Joe Biden showed the movie,"
53:53;53:59;"didn't invite him to the white house. It's not nice. Ooh, that's not nice folks. Frankly,"
53:59;54:08;"I could see it. I can see Trump going. I was there. He invented flaming at Cheetos."
54:08;54:18;"Yeah. It's good. Spicy. I feel like we, we went down this exact same line of"
54:23;54:28;"Montanye's, Montanye's goes far right and campaigns for Trump."
54:50;54:54;"I like this for the remicade movie though. Like the political involvement,"
54:54;54:58;"don't you understand this goes right up to the white house. Like one of those."
54:58;55:02;"Oh, absolutely. Third act right in the uncovering of it."
55:02;55:06;"Yeah. If Trump caught wind of this story, he would completely jump on it and be like,"
55:06;55:12;"can you believe this? They're disrespecting this great entrepreneur. If someone pushes across"
55:12;55:18;"Trump's desk, it would, he would just run with it. I mean, Kamala really has an opportunity here to"
55:18;55:25;"kind of break with the past, you know, get some new talking points in for the Democrats and, you"
55:25;55:31;"know, come with something a little tougher and more coherent than Joe. Oh, I love, I love Joe."
55:31;55:38;"I love Joe. One of the greatest presidents we've ever had, but did it make sense not to invite"
55:38;55:44;"Montanye's to his own movie? Of course not, you know, and that's not going to happen under Harris"
55:44;55:49;"administration. She could have like a movie night at the vice president. She'll resident, you know,"
55:49;55:54;"the vice president's residence and invite him and Eva Longoria more to like a movie night. I mean,"
55:54;55:59;"it's not gonna be big, but they could take like Instagram posts and stuff, you know, in front of"
55:59;56:06;"her like 70 inch TV or whatever. Yeah. Maybe they could let, um, Doug Emhoff, the first Jewish second"
56:06;56:16;"gentleman. That was where we went, we went on that on TC. Just that still is the Kamala talk."
56:16;56:20;"Now just truly one of my favorite phrases of all time. The first Jewish second gentleman"
56:20;56:28;"as the first Jewish second gentleman, I know a thing about breaking barriers. Mr. Montanye's."
56:28;56:36;"It is my honor to have you here for this screening of Flamin' Hot. The first Hispanic Frito-Lay"
56:36;56:44;"marketing executive and the first Jewish second gentleman walk into a bar and save democracy."
56:44;56:48;"It is pretty funny to think about him just like chilling in the white house."
56:48;56:53;"If he wins when he becomes the first Jewish first gentleman, it doesn't have the same ring to it."
56:53;56:57;"It does. I'm sorry. First Jewish second gentleman is so much better than first"
56:57;57:02;"Jewish first gentleman. Yeah. He was the first Jewish second gentleman."
57:05;57:15;"Oh God. Yeah. I really, what a mess. Also, is this just a last ditch effort for Montanye's?"
57:15;57:21;"Like maybe he knows deep down that could the truth be somewhere in between just guys drop"
57:21;57:27;"the lawsuit and give him a speaking engagements back. Come on. Yeah. Well, no, but I mean,"
57:27;57:33;"they've been rescinded just because his reputation has been so damaged. He's bringing the lawsuit."
57:34;57:36;"You guys aren't going to like, you're not going to..."
57:36;57:37;"Reputation up in public."
57:37;57:43;"I just still have this feeling that he's been a patsy by Frito-Lay for this the whole time."
57:43;57:51;"That Frito-Lay is essentially financing this lawsuit. That they want him to go against them"
57:51;57:58;"for the marketing side of this. We want this story to be real. I don't think it's going to"
57:58;58:02;"go very far, but I think that he's still sort of been put up to this lawsuit."
58:02;58:05;"Wait, wait, this is really thick. You're going full like..."
58:05;58:08;"I'm going full chaos on this. Yeah."
58:08;58:10;"You're saying Frito-Lay wants to be sued?"
58:10;58:14;"Yes. At least wants the idea of the lawsuit because they want this story to be real."
58:14;58:18;"Like they want this. It's more important that the narrative..."
58:18;58:20;"How is this going to prove that this only..."
58:20;58:27;"It doesn't even have to go to trial. He just needs to, it just needs to exist."
58:27;58:28;"Right. Like..."
58:28;58:32;"The market, it's like a supreme coffin, right? We always talk about it just has to be out there."
58:33;58:35;"Right. So then they can just say, you know what? They settled out of court."
58:35;58:41;"His reputation improved slightly. He gets to speak engagements back and the legend continues."
58:41;58:44;"I'm just throwing it out there. Do your own research."
58:44;58:47;"To me, this is, again, it's more the Errol Morris doc thing."
58:47;58:49;"It's the ambiguity of truth."
58:49;58:52;"It's so murky, we'll never know. It's an enigma wrapped... What's the"
58:52;58:57;"Joe Pesci line in Jet K? It's an enigma wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in, you know."
58:57;58:58;"Right."
58:58;59:00;"We'll never know. We'll never get to the bottom of it."
59:00;59:06;"We talk all the time about TC Productions. We 100% should be financing a Montaigne's"
59:06;59:07;"documentary right now."
59:07;59:11;"It's probably their most, yeah, sort of commercial work."
59:11;59:16;"Okay. Call Lance Oppenheim. Call Montaigne's. Let's make this happen."
59:16;59:26;"We've had so many $100,000 ideas before on this show. We could have been the next A24 by now,"
59:26;59:32;"but we're too busy with our day jobs. Let's do this. Montaigne's doc now."
59:32;59:38;"We've always supported him. We're interested in him. It's going to be unbiased, but let's give"
59:38;59:45;"him a platform and let's shoot it in a kind of artful, long-strething way."
59:45;59:47;"Can I pitch a title?"
59:47;59:48;"Yep."
59:48;59:50;"Up in Flames."
59:50;59:51;"Oh, perfect."
59:51;59:53;"You like that?"
59:53;59:53;"Nailed it."
59:53;59:54;"Yeah."
59:54;59:54;"Thank you."
59:54;59:55;"Thanks."
59:55;59:58;"Okay. So you guys just start making calls."
59:58;59:59;"We'll circle back."
59:59;01:00:08;"I've seen summons buried in moor air, buried in space."
01:00:08;01:00:22;"And I just lie down in the snow, buried in space."
01:00:26;01:00:35;"I've seen moss-covered stones and diamond light taking on shapes."
01:00:35;01:00:44;"Black wooden mythologies. I know a place."
01:00:44;01:00:49;"Oh, you know what I thought could be fun is just to get back into some music."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"I've just been thinking about this song and I've been curious."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Mr. Brightside?"
01:00:54;01:00:59;"Yeah, what Jake's relationship is to it, because as discussed at the top of the show,"
01:00:59;01:01:04;"at every Vampire Weekend show, we do a request section where it kind of very,"
01:01:04;01:01:09;"usually it's pretty chaotic, where we try to just play songs that people request in the audience,"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"whether or not we know them."
01:01:10;01:01:17;"Now that people know about the request section, you're getting all sorts of stuff out there."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"You're getting some deadheads requesting Eyes of the World."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"You're getting people requesting classic rock."
01:01:26;01:01:31;"You're getting younger people requesting-- somebody requests a Chapel Rhone song,"
01:01:31;01:01:37;"who I know is kind of like an exciting new pop star, but I don't know the song."
01:01:37;01:01:41;"People are coming with all sorts of different requests, but it's interesting to see"
01:01:41;01:01:47;"what's consistent night to night when you see a couple hundred phones go up with the"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"name and song titles on them."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"What's consistent?"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"Mountain Bruise."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Mountain Bruise is pretty consistent."
01:01:55;01:01:59;"And one of the most non-Mountain Bruise songs that we consistently see"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"is Mr. Brightside by The Killers."
01:02:02;01:02:09;"Luckily for us, Ray, who's a new touring member, who's shredding on violin,"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"pedal steel, guitar, you name it, amazing musician, he toured with The Killers--"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Oh, wow."
01:02:15;01:02:15;"--back in the day."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"So he knows how to play that song pretty well."
01:02:18;01:02:25;"So a couple of times we've gone into it, and the energy is just insane."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"People go nuts screaming every word."
01:02:27;01:02:37;"And I was curious, Jake, are you aware of how iconic and massive the song Mr. Brightside is?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"No."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"I don't know the song."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"If I hear it, maybe we'll recognize it."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"That's amazing."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"But I know that it's a big title."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"It's by far their most famous song."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"I don't know if I can sing you one Killer song, to be honest."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"What do you know about The Killers?"
01:02:54;01:02:58;"Well, I know that each member has made their own hot sauce."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Yeah, because they came on TC."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Yep."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I know they're from Las Vegas."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"I know that the singer's named Brandon Flowers."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Correct."
01:03:06;01:03:10;"I know they made a record like five years ago that sounded like War on Drugs."
01:03:10;01:03:15;"Yeah, they had some War on Drugs influence, I think, and some of the later stuff."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"Yep."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"That's about all I know."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"Let's throw on the song."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"Sound familiar so far?"
01:03:24;01:03:24;"Nope."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"Okay."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"I've heard this."
01:03:30;01:03:30;"Now it's familiar?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Yep."
01:03:40;01:03:45;"And she's calling a cab, while he's having a smoke, and she's taking a drink."
01:03:45;01:03:52;"Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick, and it's all in my head, but she's touching his chest."
01:03:52;01:03:59;"Now, he takes off her dress. Now, let me go."
01:03:59;01:04:09;"I just can't look, it's killing me."
01:04:10;01:04:14;"And taking control."
01:04:14;01:04:24;"Jealousy, turning six into the sea, swimming through syphilis."
01:04:24;01:04:31;"I'm a vice, choking on your love. I'm a vice, but it's just the price I pay."
01:04:31;01:04:43;"Destiny is calling me, open up my eager eyes, 'cause I miss the bright side."
01:04:43;01:04:50;"As you hear it, Jake, are you like, ""Oh, of course I know this."" Or do you like, ""Sounds familiar."""
01:04:50;01:05:00;"Yeah, somewhere in between there. It's more than, I know the song, but I've been in enough, you know, sports bars to have heard that song."
01:05:00;01:05:05;"I don't know if I just heard that, and someone was like, ""Who is this?"" I don't know if I would place it as the killers."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Really?"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"I'm not sure."
01:05:07;01:05:13;"You know, even just the opening line alone, ""Coming out of my cage."" That's kind of a meme, right, Seinfeld?"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Yeah."
01:05:14;01:05:21;"I don't know how it would be used as a meme, but I feel like that's a whole thing, ""Coming out of my cage."""
01:05:21;01:05:31;"It's like something people put on an Instagram caption, or they might pair it with a funny picture that subverts the lyric on Twitter."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Yeah, it's definitely a thing."
01:05:33;01:05:37;"Meaning, like, ""I'm ready to go, I'm going out for the night, I'm ready to party."""
01:05:37;01:05:43;"And actually, I've always wanted to look at these lyrics, because I think the Killers are a great band."
01:05:43;01:05:48;"I've always thought of Brandon like, super cool, interesting guy."
01:05:48;01:05:52;"And some people have compared this song to ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:05:52;01:05:59;"That song is for, like, older millennials. This song is for, like, younger millennials and Zoomers."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Maybe for everybody."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"Like, in some ways, the Killers are bigger than ever."
01:06:03;01:06:09;"The status of this song has just grown and grown and grown, which is pretty amazing for, like, a rock band."
01:06:09;01:06:16;"But I always wanted to kind of do a deep dive on the lyrics, and especially because it gets requested so much, maybe it's good for me to learn them a little bit."
01:06:16;01:06:21;"But, yeah, opening line, ""Coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine."
01:06:21;01:06:25;"Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all."
01:06:25;01:06:28;"It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"It was only a kiss."
01:06:30;01:06:32;"It was only a kiss."""
01:06:32;01:06:37;"So, in the beginning, it kind of sounds like a guy who's, like, ready to have a good time."
01:06:37;01:06:44;"Like, maybe, I don't know if it's, like, a dude who had, like, just got out of a dark period or something, and he's, like, trying to be optimistic."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"""Coming out of my cage."" Maybe he was in a mental hospital for a while."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Maybe he was laying real low."
01:06:51;01:06:55;"Maybe he went through a bad breakup, or who knows."
01:06:55;01:06:59;"But he's coming out of his cage, and he's been doing just fine."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"And then, when he says, ""It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"It was only a kiss."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"It was only a kiss."""
01:07:04;01:07:07;"You can picture the song going a few different ways."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"Is this about a guy who, like, messed with the wrong girl?"
01:07:10;01:07:16;"He kissed her, and now, you know, she's saying the baby is his, you know?"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"Like, a Billie Jean thing."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"Yeah."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"Is this guy, like, a playboy?"
01:07:21;01:07:25;"But he, you know, played the wrong girl?"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"Or, you know, or did it just start out with a kiss?"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"I wasn't looking for anything too serious, but now it got serious?"
01:07:30;01:07:36;"So, at first, you assume, you know, that he kissed somebody, and whatever."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"It's creating an unexpected situation."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"But then, there's the interesting turn."
01:07:41;01:07:46;"""Now I'm falling asleep, and she's calling a cab."
01:07:46;01:07:50;"While he's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag."
01:07:50;01:07:56;"Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick, and it's all in my head."
01:07:56;01:08:00;"But she's touching his chest now."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"He takes off her dress now."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"Let me go."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"And I just can't look."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"It's killing me."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"They're taking control."""
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Great pre-chorus."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"And then, the chorus."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"""Jealousy, turning saints into the sea."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"Swimming through sick lullabies."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Choking on your alibi."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"But it's just the price I pay."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"Destiny is calling me."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Open up my eager eyes."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside."""
01:08:26;01:08:29;"This is a very interesting song."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"What's your guys' take?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Obviously, it's about jealousy."
01:08:31;01:08:38;"But when he says, ""It's all in my head,"" is this like he's a dude with a retroactive jealousy"
01:08:38;01:08:39;"issue?"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Is this girl actually his girlfriend?"
01:08:41;01:08:47;"But he keeps picturing some wack ex she had?"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"What's happening here?"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Is this a negative fantasy?"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Because also, he was kissing her, then he's falling asleep, and she's calling a cab."
01:08:56;01:09:00;"But then this other dude appears who's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"What's your guys' take?"
01:09:01;01:09:05;"""I didn't mean to hurt you."""
01:09:05;01:09:08;"I feel like I've now read the true story."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"So I want to weigh in."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"I'm going to weigh in after."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"No, I'm going to weigh in after."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"No, no."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"No spoilers."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"I'm surprised there is-- I mean, I guess I'm not surprised there's a true story."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"That makes sense that there'd be a true story."
01:09:20;01:09:25;"But I think they leave it deliberately, narratively ambiguous."
01:09:25;01:09:31;"The most interesting part to me is the last part in the title, ""Open Up My Eager Eyes."""
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Because he's such a downer the whole song."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"He's such a neg head."
01:09:35;01:09:41;"He's either a jealous guy who's freaking out about some ex, or they've broken up and she's"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"met someone immediately."
01:09:44;01:09:48;"And he's just completely in a spiral of jealousy."
01:09:48;01:09:52;"But it's just the price you pay, destiny is calling me."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Open up my eager eyes."
01:09:53;01:09:57;"Is that maybe sarcastic?"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"I never look on the bright side."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"I'm totally a-- you're like, ""Oh, yeah, you know me."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"I'm Mr. Brightside over here."""
01:10:04;01:10:05;"He's actually being sarcastic."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Right."
01:10:06;01:10:12;"This dude's hanging out with his friends at the bar and just being like, ""It's crazy,"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"man."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"She's probably cheating on me right now."""
01:10:14;01:10:16;"And they're like, ""I don't know, man."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"She seems pretty cool."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"I don't think she would do that."""
01:10:18;01:10:23;"He's like, ""No, it's definitely that dude and the guy with the chest that she's always"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"touching."""
01:10:24;01:10:25;"And they're like, ""Chill, dude."""
01:10:25;01:10:26;"And he's like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Right, right."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah, sure, sure."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Yeah, I'm Mr. Brightside."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Right."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Yeah, it's all good."""
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Yeah."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"There's an element of that."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"So maybe that's what it is."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"That would make the most logical sense."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"Because otherwise, it's like, ""Whoa."""
01:10:37;01:10:48;"And the tone of the song is very sneering and relentlessly negative headspace."
01:10:48;01:10:52;"There's no turn in the music that makes me think that, ""Oh, he actually is like..."""
01:10:52;01:10:54;"This character is a bit of a negative creep."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"A little bit of a negative creep."
01:10:57;01:11:02;"There's no turn in the music or the performance that makes me think that he actually has an"
01:11:02;01:11:06;"expansive worldview and that he's going to get through it."
01:11:06;01:11:11;"I also wonder if there's, rather than being sarcastic, another interpretation is that"
01:11:11;01:11:23;"this song takes place at the exact moment when a extremely jealous guy, who maybe actually"
01:11:23;01:11:30;"is getting cheated on, this song takes place at the exact moment of repression."
01:11:30;01:11:36;"He's seeing something so harsh that makes him so insanely jealous that this is literally"
01:11:36;01:11:41;"the moment that he pushes it down, where he's literally in the jealousy moment."
01:11:41;01:11:44;"It's like next level jealousy."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"What is happening?"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"It started out with a kiss."
01:11:49;01:11:54;"Our relationship simply began with a kiss, and now I'm being tortured."
01:11:54;01:12:02;"Watching the love of my life touch this guy's chest and they're taking off their clothes."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"He's literally in hell, and he's just sitting in jealousy."
01:12:05;01:12:10;"And then he's choking, and you're choking on your alibi using this really intense language,"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"swimming through sick lullabies."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"And then this is the moment where he goes, ""But you know what?"
01:12:15;01:12:19;"This is just the price I pay for having a really fine girlfriend."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"It's my destiny."""
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Chin up."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"""So all good."""
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Yeah, so he's not even being sarcastic."
01:12:25;01:12:30;"This is the moment that he forces himself back into the delusion that it's all good."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"The truth is too painful kind of thing."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"But now I'm curious."
01:12:35;01:12:38;"Before Nick, let's just look at verse two and see if there's anything else."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"Let's listen to verse two."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"It's all the same lyric."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"Oh yeah, same line."
01:12:43;01:12:46;"Oh yeah, you're right."
01:12:46;01:12:53;"Verse two is exactly the same."
01:12:53;01:12:56;"Except for that phone call, ""It was only a kiss."""
01:12:56;01:12:57;"I love that."
01:12:57;01:13:05;"I love the confidence of being like, ""We wrote such a banger that it's just…"""
01:13:05;01:13:06;"Twice."
01:13:06;01:13:09;"Second verse, same as the first."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Yeah."
01:13:10;01:13:14;"And honestly, it couldn't matter less."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Like, it's probably good he repeated it."
01:13:16;01:13:21;"I'm on the Genius page and there's a little note at the top that says, ""This was the"
01:13:21;01:13:25;"Killers' first ever recorded song for their 2002 demo."""
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Amazing."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"Coming out of the gates hot."
01:13:29;01:13:57;"They were coming out of their cage."
01:13:57;01:14:03;"I want to say just narratively, the idea that he's this obsessive and paranoid, it actually"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"works that he repeats all the lyrics."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"It doesn't feel like lazy."
01:14:09;01:14:13;"There's something about the whole tone that I'd be like, ""Oh yeah, this guy's obsessed"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"with this girl."""
01:14:14;01:14:15;"Oh yeah, that's a good point."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"It actually works that he'd be like, ""I'm just going to say the same thing to my friends"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"at the bar that I just said five times in a row."""
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Like he's…"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Or in his head."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"He's just on a loop in his head."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"Yeah, it works."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Yeah, that's a great point."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"It's because they do change, his delivery changes a little bit."
01:14:29;01:14:34;"And in the second verse, there's that, ""It was only a kiss."""
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Like the phone call."
01:14:35;01:14:41;"It's another part of his subconscious, his Jungian shadow calling him, ""It was only"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"a kiss."""
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Yeah, I love that interpretation."
01:14:44;01:14:48;"This dude is just like such a live wire that it's just like, ""You got anything else to"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"say in the second verse?"""
01:14:49;01:14:54;"And he's just like, ""Coming out of my cage."""
01:14:54;01:14:56;"He's forcing himself into a situation."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Okay, but now I'm too curious."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"What is the real story?"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Somehow I've never heard this."
01:15:01;01:15:06;"So we're all right, but there is a real story to it."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"It's incredible that Flowers will tell it."
01:15:08;01:15:14;"So it depicts the true story of Flowers."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"Brandon was a young guy."
01:15:15;01:15:19;"He took a trip to Southern California and he happened to meet a janitor who worked at"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Frito-Lay."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"And the story this guy told him, he couldn't get out of his head."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"He went back to Vegas."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"He told Ronnie Vannucci and the boys, ""You wouldn't believe what happened to this guy."""
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Okay, sorry."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"Now tell the real story."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"It's the true story."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"So it depicts a true story of Flowers' jealousy and paranoia when he walked into a bar in"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Las Vegas and found his girlfriend cheating on him."
01:15:40;01:15:46;"And so this is interesting because it also, I think part of the surreal, dreamy vibe."
01:15:46;01:15:52;"So here's the quote, ""I was asleep and I knew something was wrong,"" Flowers said."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"""I have these instincts."
01:15:54;01:15:58;"So I went to the Crown and Anchor, a bar in Vegas, and my girlfriend was there with another"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"guy."""
01:15:59;01:16:02;"So he was literally woken up out of a dream."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Got dressed."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"I got it."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"Yeah, gets dressed."
01:16:05;01:16:09;"Also, I think famously sober, right?"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Mormon sober?"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"I think so."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Yeah, I don't think he drinks."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Yeah, I think he's..."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"So he gets up and he goes, ""I'm going to go to this bar."""
01:16:16;01:16:18;"Yeah, practicing Mormon."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"Gets up and goes to the bar and he goes, ""Ooh, I just don't have a good feeling."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"My paranoia."""
01:16:22;01:16:24;"It's right."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"And that's it."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"So there you go."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"Proven right."
01:16:28;01:16:29;"That's also interesting."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"Yeah, that's interesting too because in the..."
01:16:32;01:16:36;"So I guess in real life, he was having uneasy dreams."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Okay, first of all, we got to get Brandon back on the show."
01:16:39;01:16:43;"I want to ask him about if he's psychic."
01:16:43;01:16:46;"People just are so interested in the song that he tells the story and you're like, ""Wait,"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"back up."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"Have you ever had any other kind of visions?"""
01:16:49;01:16:53;"By the way, at the time I'm finding he did drink."
01:16:53;01:17:00;"So not that it has anything to do with it, but it almost makes it even..."
01:17:00;01:17:03;"It was stranger to me that here's this guy that doesn't drink, doesn't..."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"It probably goes to bars with his friends or whatever, but it's like, ""Oh, my girlfriend's"
01:17:06;01:17:07;"at a bar."""
01:17:07;01:17:10;"But even so, there must be a million bars in Vegas."
01:17:10;01:17:13;"No, he was like, he woke up and he's like, ""Crown and anchor."""
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Crown and anchor."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"I wonder how psychic he is."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Brandon, what's going to happen in the election?"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"Brandon, what other kind of visions have you had?"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"Imagine he was just like..."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Did Richard Montanos."
01:17:25;01:17:26;"This was..."
01:17:26;01:17:29;"He's like, ""This was the first of many visions I had."""
01:17:29;01:17:32;"Oh, did any of your visions inspire other killer songs?"
01:17:32;01:17:37;"He's like, ""My other visions are too dark to share with the world."""
01:17:37;01:17:40;"And there would be mass hysteria if people knew."
01:17:40;01:17:45;"But yeah, so in real life, he's having an uneasy sleep and he has this vision and he's"
01:17:45;01:17:51;"drawn to this bar and this uneasy feeling, this vision of his girlfriend cheating on"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"him is true."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"But it's even crazier."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"I agree."
01:17:55;01:17:59;"The song is so surreal because in the song, it's not like, ""And I couldn't sleep and I"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"went to the bar."""
01:18:00;01:18:02;"He says, ""Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab."""
01:18:02;01:18:05;"So in this version, he's in almost..."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"He's in the..."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"What do you call it?"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Like alpha state?"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Alpha wave?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Whatever."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"We're like half asleep and your brain is just like on a different vibration."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"So that vision of him half asleep and he's kind of actually there."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"He's doing remote viewing."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"So he's in bed at his house, but he's also kind of seeing what's happening at the bar."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"He's astral projecting."
01:18:27;01:18:31;"He's astral projecting and he has crazy sleep paralysis."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Just like, ""What the fuck?"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"What the fuck?"""
01:18:33;01:18:40;"And then maybe because it's a Schrodinger's cat thing, because he's astral projecting,"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"it is in a sense a dream."
01:18:42;01:18:47;"So maybe he still hopes that by being Mr. Brightside, he can kind of bargain it away"
01:18:47;01:18:50;"from being reality."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"Very interesting song."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"I mean, obviously, it's a catchy song."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"It's energetic."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"People go nuts for it."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"And then the outro is, he just goes, ""I never"" over and over again."
01:19:00;01:19:01;"""I never."""
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Play the outro."
01:19:02;01:19:32;"Yeah, I"
01:19:32;01:19:41;"think about the song as like a surreal, like, it feels very like Cronenberg or something."
01:19:41;01:19:48;"Dude's fucking astral projecting and having this weird psychological nightmare."
01:19:48;01:19:52;"And then just for, I guess when I'm used to listening to the song and I just hear him"
01:19:52;01:19:56;"saying ""I never"" at the end, I don't think I even really knew what the song was about."
01:19:56;01:20:00;"Some people might say I still don't know what the song is about, but I never had my own"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"interpretation."
01:20:01;01:20:04;"And I just, when I just heard him saying ""I never,"" I just thought of it kind of as being"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"like, ""Why, I never."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Well I never."""
01:20:07;01:20:11;"But now I hear it as like this eerie, incomplete sentence."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"Like this dude half asleep, being like tortured."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"And he's just like, ""I never."""
01:20:15;01:20:16;"And it's like, ""I never what?"""
01:20:16;01:20:17;"And it's like, ""Bam, bam, bam."""
01:20:17;01:20:18;"And it just like ends."
01:20:18;01:20:22;"No, because it could be like, ""I never should have started dating you."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"I never should have shown up to the bar."""
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Like you have no idea."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"Like, if he didn't show up to the bar, he wouldn't know."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Yeah, it's very weird."
01:20:29;01:20:33;"I think that's why this is a tremendous piece of art."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"And I would say kind of a deeper song than ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:20:37;01:20:38;"I'll do ""Respect a Journey."""
01:20:38;01:20:42;"That's an amazing song, but if it gets people pumped up, like they just want to sing."
01:20:42;01:20:45;"This has, I think this has shades of Cronenberg."
01:20:45;01:20:49;"A little bit of like the, I don't know, I keep thinking of Psycho Killer."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Just like, ""Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire."""
01:20:51;01:20:55;"Just like a dude alone in his apartment kind of vibe."
01:20:55;01:21:01;"I don't think this guy's a killer, but just like the weird loner dude."
01:21:01;01:21:07;"And it's funny to think it's so anthemic that just like, you know, at a bar in like downtown"
01:21:07;01:21:11;"Memphis, like frat dudes are grabbing each other going like, ""Oh, never."""
01:21:11;01:21:15;"Yeah, it's interesting to have like an emotionally ambiguous anthem."
01:21:15;01:21:21;"Because yeah, like you said, ""Don't Stop Believing"" is like, it's unambiguous."
01:21:21;01:21:28;"It's ""Don't Stop Believing"" in yourself and in your love and all, you know, your dreams."
01:21:28;01:21:32;"But this is just sort of like, why did I think of ""Don't Stop""?"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"It doesn't sound like ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:21:34;01:21:38;"It's a totally different emotional palette and sonic."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"I just understood, like, what is the connection?"
01:21:40;01:21:44;"Even though, and for some reason it popped into my head too when we were listening to"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"it."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"What is it?"
01:21:46;01:21:52;"I think it serves a similar role in that you could play it at a bar or a party and"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"a similar type of person will be like, ""Oh, ****."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Like let's **** sing."""
01:21:56;01:22:04;"I think also something about like the soaring melody just makes people want to like sing"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"and it's, I don't know."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Interesting."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"In some ways, yeah, a very different song."
01:22:09;01:22:12;"And look, above all, they're just both two massive songs."
01:22:12;01:22:20;"Like the biggest, probably the biggest rock songs of the 21st century."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"These are just my back of the envelope calculations."
01:22:23;01:22:30;"I think the biggest rock songs of the 21st century would be ""Mr. Brightside,"" ""Seven"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"Nation Army"" by the White Stripes."
01:22:33;01:22:40;"And you know, those like Arctic Monkey songs, you know, those big riff Arctic Monkey songs."
01:22:40;01:22:45;"I guess you could throw in like ""Kings of Leon."""
01:22:45;01:22:48;"What about like ""21 Pilots"" or whatever?"
01:22:48;01:22:49;"Yeah, that's big."
01:22:49;01:22:53;"They're a fusion of hip hop and rock, so I'd put it in a slightly different category."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Different thing."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"But you're saying straight rock."
01:22:56;01:23:01;"Yeah, maybe this is how you remind me by Nickelback, who we talked about last time."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"But I don't know."
01:23:02;01:23:07;"But for me, like true, true global songs, for me, this is what comes to mind."
01:23:07;01:23:12;"""Seven Nation Army,"" ""Mr. Brightside,"" and ""Do I Wanna Know."""
01:23:12;01:23:16;"And ""Do I Wanna Know"" is also-- but that's not a triumphant song."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Those lyrics are also about a guy."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"Do I wanna know?"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"It's like, it's also about a kind of insecure guy."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Do I wanna know if I'm getting cheated on?"
01:23:23;01:23:28;"But even that, it's like, you know, the vibe of that song."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"Do I wanna know?"
01:23:30;01:23:34;"It's like, that's maybe similar emotional terrain, but it's less ambiguous."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"""Seven Nation Army"" is just like a rocker."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Yeah, this one is-- this is the eeriest one."
01:23:40;01:23:46;"So, but you were saying that it's really grown in stature in the last five, ten years."
01:23:46;01:23:49;"So it came out like 20 years ago."
01:23:49;01:23:53;"It was unambiguously a hit when it came out."
01:23:53;01:23:57;"The Killers have always been a big band, but it went beast mode in the last five to ten"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"years."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"But how?"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"This organic, sort of zeitgeist, cultural thing that just sort of happens?"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"I mean, was there like a-- obviously with ""Don't Stop Believin'"" it was rediscovered"
01:24:06;01:24:07;"because of The Sopranos."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"Right."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"There was a reappraisal."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"I remember there was a reappraisal."
01:24:11;01:24:17;"There was a moment on Twitter where it felt like people had collectively rediscovered"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"the song and were like--"
01:24:18;01:24:22;"I also think that The Killers are a band that has just sort of never left, right?"
01:24:22;01:24:27;"In their own way, they just like have-- they've been consistent and growing, especially internationally."
01:24:27;01:24:36;"Yeah, well I know because I had some friends who went to their run of shows at the O2 in"
01:24:36;01:24:41;"London, and they did some unprecedented number of shows in a row there."
01:24:41;01:24:47;"And so they're-- I know as a touring act, they're bigger than ever."
01:24:47;01:24:51;"And I think in no small part thanks to-- I mean, they have a strong catalog, but I mean,"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"this song is just--"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"They should do a hometown show at the Sphere, huh?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Oh, that's great."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Oh, Killers run?"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Killers at the Sphere?"
01:24:58;01:25:03;"I want to read this quote from Flowers in 2012, just because it feels very TC."
01:25:03;01:25:09;"And he said that when they were making this record-- so they were very depressed after"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"hearing the Strokes album, ""Is This It?"""
01:25:12;01:25:15;"And that record was just so perfect, Flowers said."
01:25:15;01:25:20;"We threw away everything we were working on, and the only song that remained on the cut"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"was ""Mr. Brightside."""
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Gauntlet was thrown."
01:25:24;01:25:31;"And all due respect to the Stone Cold classic ""Is This It?"" but even ""Last Night"" is dwarfed"
01:25:31;01:25:34;"by the cultural footprint of ""Mr. Brightside."""
01:25:34;01:25:37;"Not in my car."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Until today."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"Last night, she said, ""Oh, baby, I feel so down."""
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Oh, it turned me on when I feel left out."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"So I, I turned around and I looked around, and I saw a man with a gun."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"And I said, ""Oh, I'm gonna kill him."""
01:25:48;01:26:16;"And I said, ""Oh, I'm gonna kill him."""
01:26:16;01:26:43;"And I said, ""Oh, I'm gonna kill him."""

01:27:40;01:28:10;"And I said, ""Oh, I'm gonna kill him."""
01:28:10;01:28:11;"And I said, ""Oh, I'm gonna kill him."""
01:28:12;01:28:16;"Although maybe that was weirdly a curse, because England, of course, did not go all the way"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"in the Euros."
01:28:17;01:28:23;"Maybe it's like, hey, an amazing song, but don't get too hyped up about an ambiguous"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"song about a psychological nightmare."
01:28:25;01:28:29;"Is that really what you want to be, you know, yelling at the top of your lungs?"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Is that the kind of energy you want to be giving your national team?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"It's like, ""We will rock you."""
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Another classic ambiguous song."
01:28:34;01:29:00;"I wanted to play another song on this show."
01:29:00;01:29:03;"Sometimes we forget about the radio part of Internet Radio Show, and that we have the"
01:29:03;01:29:11;"amazing ability to play music, which not everybody has, especially on podcasts."
01:29:11;01:29:17;"But there's a solo Brandon Flowers song that I've always loved, and I feel like not enough"
01:29:17;01:29:29;"people know it, because we're talking about Brandon's fascinating lyrics and the killers"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"and stuff."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"I just wanted to throw this out there, because I always liked this song."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"It's called ""Still Want You."""
01:29:34;01:29:40;"I think it's from his second solo album, and it's produced by a friend of the show, Ariel"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"Rechshied, which is probably why I'm so familiar with it, because I kind of remember when he"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"was working on this song."
01:29:45;01:29:49;"But I've always thought this is a very interesting song, and more people should know it."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"Let's listen to it."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"[MUSIC - BRANDON FLOWERS, ""STILL WANT YOU""]"
01:29:51;01:30:15;"[MUSIC - BRANDON FLOWERS, ""STILL WANT YOU""]"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"I love that it's kind of like this light, kind of funky groove."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"Little bit of a '70s Bowie vibe."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"It's ""Rules."""
01:31:11;01:31:14;"I like this so much more than the killers."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"I gotta check out the Brandon Flowers solo."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"You should check out more of it."
01:31:16;01:31:17;"You should check out this whole album."
01:31:17;01:31:18;"Yeah."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"I feel like I can hear the Ariel in there, too."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Yeah."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"There's a lot of classic Ariel-isms in this."
01:31:26;01:31:30;"[MUSIC - BRANDON FLOWERS, ""STILL WANT YOU""]"
01:31:30;01:31:34;"Yeah, that's a good call on young Americans."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Yeah."
01:31:35;01:31:37;"It's kind of feel of Bowie."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"Yeah."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"[MUSIC - BRANDON FLOWERS, ""STILL WANT YOU""]"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Yeah, those backing vocals on the chorus."

01:32:23;01:32:28;"I guess like Mr. Bright said, it's so arch and kind of unrelenting."

01:32:44;01:32:45;"I think it was--"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"I think-- yeah, I think there was a video."

01:32:57;01:32:59;"Maybe Vampire should cover this song."

01:33:01;01:33:03;"I feel like you guys would crush it."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"It did remind me a little bit of Vampire."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"But maybe that was the REL, or--"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"I don't know, it just has that kind of light touch that you guys have."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"So a little bouncier."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Maybe that's why I'm drawn to it."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"But also just like when you actually--"
01:33:19;01:33:24;"the verses are kind of about connecting with somebody."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"And then I just love the--"

01:34:10;01:34:14;"I love this idea of you guys working up a full cover of this."
01:34:14;01:34:18;"Back in the day when people would cover their contemporaries"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"all the time."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:20;01:34:24;"You know, just like Joe Cocker doing like a--"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"or Jimi Hendrix doing like a Beatles song or something."
01:34:26;01:34:27;"Right."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Like the week the album came out."
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Right."
01:34:29;01:34:32;"It's like, oh, let's work one of those up."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"The Dead covering Dylan all the time."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Of course."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Yeah."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"I think I even wrote this down years ago."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"It was like covers."
01:34:38;01:34:41;"But I guess the tough part is with covers,"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"when it's not in the request zone,"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"is that then when you're actually kind of like working on a set"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"list, and you're like, oh, but if people don't know the song,"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"but maybe in some ways talking about it on time crisis"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"is the way to get the ball rolling."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"That's kind of what happened with Joker, man."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Right."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"No, I mean, if you did it, and he started like peppering it"
01:35:01;01:35:04;"into the set every like five shows,"
01:35:04;01:35:08;"the real heads would like catch on really fast."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"If you just commit to it--"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"Or just like where it's a cover that almost gets more well-known."
01:35:12;01:35:16;"I mean, there's obviously like lots of examples of this."
01:35:16;01:35:22;"But if it feels like a vampire song, and you do it,"
01:35:22;01:35:25;"and you make it a vampire song, even though it's not"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"the most well-known Brandon Flower, like that's just--"
01:35:28;01:35:29;"But I also think that--"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"I just think that's cool."
01:35:30;01:35:34;"Yeah, it's just that I feel like it needs female backup vocals."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"That's what really seals it in."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Do we talk about--"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"I mean, it's obviously not a contemporary."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"But didn't we talk about how Dave Matthews covering"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"all along the Watchtower, more people"
01:35:44;01:35:49;"like the Dave Matthews version than the Dylan or Hendrix version?"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Did we talk about that?"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"More people where?"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Just like there's sort of like a crowd of people"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"that would go to Dave Matthews shows"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"that just really didn't know it was a cover."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Oh, weird."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Yeah, I guess that happens."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"I mean, I'm sure to this day, there's plenty of people"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"who think it's a Jimi Hendrix original."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Yeah, for sure."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"Actually, OK, rather than do the top five,"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"I know one more song that we could go out on,"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"which is the exact same kind of thing."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"And I love this one, too."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"Can you play Bruce Springsteen, ""Jersey Girl""?"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"A lot of people know this live version"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"from that classic E Street Band box set,"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"Bruce Springsteen live '75 to '85 or whatever."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"But this song is written by Tom Waits."
01:36:31;01:36:34;"It makes me think a little bit-- do you remember when Andy Samberg"
01:36:34;01:36:37;"used to do this Nicholas Cage character on SNL"
01:36:37;01:36:41;"where he would talk about new movies in theater"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"and he's like, ""It's a movie about this."""
01:36:43;01:36:46;"And I can't remember exactly, but the punchline was"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"he would just always go, ""How am I not in that?"""
01:36:48;01:36:51;"He'd describe some crazy action movie and just go,"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"""So is it a good movie?"""
01:36:52;01:36:53;"He'd go, ""How am I not in that?"""
01:36:53;01:36:55;"He was just obsessed about the fact that he should have been"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"in every movie."
01:36:57;01:37:01;"And I think with this Tom Waits ""Jersey Girl"" song,"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"it's a little bit of Bruce Springsteen being like,"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"""How did I not write this?"""
01:37:04;01:37:06;"And I mean, ""Real"" recognized ""real,"""
01:37:06;01:37:08;"so Bruce said, ""We might as well cover it."""
01:37:08;01:37:10;"And it's--maybe--who knows?"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"Maybe if Bruce would have found writing a song called ""Jersey Girl"""
01:37:13;01:37:17;"too on the nose, so Tom Waits, as this kind of quirky"
01:37:17;01:37:21;"California dude, can come in and see the exoticism"
01:37:21;01:37:22;"of a Jersey girl."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Brings a fresh angle, yeah."
01:37:24;01:37:28;"And then Bruce can sing it as a cover, but whereas he probably--"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"he might not have wanted to put a song called ""Jersey Girl"""
01:37:30;01:37:32;"on ""Born to Run."""
01:37:32;01:37:34;"He might have been a little self-conscious, like,"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"""Well, I'm already the Jersey guy."""
01:37:36;01:37:38;"But it's so perfect for him to sing."
01:37:38;01:37:42;"And I particularly love this version because"
01:37:42;01:37:46;"you can tell that at first the crowd doesn't know the song that well."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"They're not going nuts when he first goes into it,"

01:42:52;01:43:05;"and then he has this stuff performed by these super mega, kind of major key extroverted stars, like, makes me think of that Eagles song, Old 55."

01:43:19;01:43:22;"That's a great song."
01:43:22;01:43:30;"Yeah, I love that song, and I love that recording. I like the Tom Waits version too, but I love kind of, that's a truly great live recording,"
01:43:30;01:43:34;"because I'm sure they probably goosed the crowd noise a little bit, but you hear people reacting in real time."
01:43:34;01:43:41;"But to your question, Nick, about like, if you're saying literally cover Jersey Girl, I think on the East Coast, we could."
01:43:41;01:43:47;"I totally think you actually cover Jersey Girl. I just think that what you're saying is interesting, which is like, here's a live recording,"
01:43:47;01:43:52;"like he's playing a concert where it's not, the audience doesn't really know the song and they're with him."
01:43:52;01:43:58;"They're with the lyrics, they're responding to it. If you, you know, now it is like a sort of a shut up and play that maybe it always is."
01:43:58;01:44:08;"But if you were to like bust out your Brandon Flowers song or something, do you think you have, does a contemporary audience now, would they stay with you?"
01:44:08;01:44:17;"Well, it's, I mean, definitely you can make the case that back then when people were like going out to a concert, they were like, I want to hear music all night long."
01:44:17;01:44:24;"This is where I want to be. You know, you don't have a phone. There's not as many distractions or things to think about."
01:44:24;01:44:33;"But I mean, by the same token, I do think generally, you know, as we started to play like much longer shows, the crowd stays, you know, like some people got to leave."
01:44:33;01:44:38;"But like people want their money's worth when they come to a show and they're like, they want to be in that environment."
01:44:38;01:44:44;"I definitely don't feel when I look, you know, sometimes you hear people be like, oh man, go to shows now and everybody's on their phone."
01:44:44;01:44:52;"I don't really feel that way when I look out at the at the crowd. You know, when you play a song, people know really well, you can, of course, you feel the energy."
01:44:52;01:45:00;"But I try to remember that whenever we're trying something new that like if people are even just standing there, that means they're taking it in."
01:45:00;01:45:05;"But yeah, I wonder if like I wonder if like Bruce intro this song. I also think context is important."
01:45:05;01:45:13;"I've been thinking about that more, too. Like, you know, even when we're like going to play like our like cocaine cowboys medley or something, I like give the audience a
heads up like this."
01:45:13;01:45:20;"You might find this one a little bit strange, but, you know, stick with it just because like, yeah, I guess this is pretty like showbiz 101."
01:45:20;01:45:36;"But it's more obvious to me as I get older, we were kind of like, oh, yeah, people at a big, noisy, disorienting concert, like people are looking for cues sometimes where
it's like, you know, make some noise for, you know, whoever."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"Some people go to concerts all the time. Some people go once every three years."
01:45:39;01:45:58;"So like a little bit of context is always helpful about like, you know, put your hands in there, do you know, make some noise and especially explaining a song to like I
feel like I know the feeling of being at a show where you're just kind of like you're getting into a zone where you're like, what song is this?"
01:45:58;01:46:07;"Wait, what is that? Like, yeah, if you're going to do a cover, you got to tell people like, OK, like, all right, this is a song like by Tom Waits called Jersey Girl."
01:46:07;01:46:11;"It's about this or that, you know, he's just going where all my Jersey girls at."
01:46:11;01:46:15;"If that's all he said to start it, he's got them in his hand."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Right. This one is for the Jersey Girls."
01:46:17;01:46:30;"I mean, I even felt like, you know, actually, it's funny. I remember at one of the times when somebody requested Mountain Brews and I wish I'd remember the chords
better, but it was at one of our Montana shows."
01:46:30;01:46:36;"So we were out kind of like in in the mountains. So I was like, oh, yeah, we'll do a little bit of sing a little bit of Mountain Brews."
01:46:36;01:46:40;"But then I wanted to explain to the audience, because of course, some percentage of the audience knew the song."
01:46:40;01:46:45;"But I was also like, this is a great opportunity to tell people what the song's about."
01:46:45;01:46:49;"And I remember being like, oh, this is a song by a good friend of ours, Jake Longstreth."
01:46:49;01:46:52;"And it's about on a Sunday morning. I think it was a Sunday, too."
01:46:52;01:47:01;"So I was like, waking up hungover, call your buddy, make a plan to go for a hike and pack some beers in the bag and crack them at the top of the mountain."
01:47:01;01:47:05;"And then some people were like, whoo, just to even hear the explanation."
01:47:05;01:47:10;"And then when I actually sang a little bit of it, I do think the vibe was different."
01:47:10;01:47:16;"And all it took was like a tiny bit of explanation, because then people were paying attention to the lyrics a little more, you know."
01:47:16;01:47:21;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike?"
01:47:21;01:47:27;"Meet at the trailhead light around a quarter to three."
01:47:27;01:47:32;"Me and Bobby stayed out late last night."
01:47:32;01:47:37;"Get on the trail, shake the cobwebs free."
01:47:37;01:47:43;"As we get to the top of the mountain, there's a view."
01:47:43;01:47:51;"Take a load off and crack a few mountain brews."
01:47:51;01:48:02;"Mountain brews, sweet mountain brews."
01:48:02;01:48:10;"Mountain brews, sweet as morning dew."
01:48:49;01:48:54;"Have another brew as we look out over the town."
01:48:54;01:49:00;"The highway's far away, it ain't making a sound."
01:49:00;01:49:05;"All of the buildings look like dominoes."
01:49:05;01:49:11;"Wouldn't take much for them to topple and go."
01:49:11;01:49:16;"So here we sit, soaking up this view."
01:49:16;01:49:20;"Oh, let's head down the route of those mountain brews."
01:49:20;01:49:31;"Mountain brews, sweet mountain brews."
01:49:31;01:49:42;"Mountain brews, sweet as morning dew."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Mountain brews."
01:49:46;01:49:57;"Mountain brews."
01:49:57;01:50:10;"Mountain brews."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"But yeah, I don't know if I-- how I could introduce that Brandon Flowers song."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"I mean, I think people-- I'd be like, this is a Brandon Flowers song"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"from his second solo album produced by Ariel Reksha."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"Stuff like that's worth saying."
01:51:09;01:51:13;"And be like, and if any of you are concerned that crime is on the rise"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"but you still got someone to hug and kiss at night"
01:51:16;01:51:19;"who makes you feel good, this one's for you."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"[HUMMING]"
01:51:21;01:51:22;"I don't know."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"But that's real showbiz [BLEEP]"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"You listen to those old recordings of like Frank Sinatra and stuff."
01:51:27;01:51:32;"There's so much talking and vamping and like set up."
01:51:32;01:51:35;"And this next number is by a dear friend of mine."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"It was written in 1942."
01:51:37;01:51:40;"The original version, you know, like that kind of [BLEEP]"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"And actually, it is-- I like that stuff."
01:51:42;01:51:45;"Yeah, I encourage bands to do more banter."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Yeah, some people are really good at it."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"Eddie Vedder just out there like telling stories and stuff."
01:51:50;01:51:55;"Yeah, remember when we saw Pearl Jam at the Forum,"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"he went on this jag about like Howard Zinn."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"There were a couple like real non sequitur left field"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"like Eddie Vedder monologues."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"Well, I remember he was--"
01:52:05;01:52:09;"I really noted this moment when he was talking about"
01:52:09;01:52:13;"like taking one of his kids to tour colleges"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"because it was like a sweet moment."
01:52:15;01:52:20;"And obviously, you and I are not at that moment in our life journey."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"But you could tell a lot of the crowd was."
01:52:22;01:52:26;"I kind of remember him being like, ""Took my kid on some college tours this summer."""
01:52:26;01:52:28;"It had that vibe, like you know how it is."
01:52:28;01:52:31;"And I felt like there were like murmurs in the crowd like, ""Oh yeah, Eddie."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"I just did that too."""
01:52:33;01:52:37;"Just went to Wake Forest."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Took my son down to Wake Forest."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"Learned a lot about their financial structures."
01:52:42;01:52:46;"Wait, what is-- Wake Forest is the virtual endoscopy?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"I don't remember."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"I believe so."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"That's a pretty cool school."
01:52:51;01:52:55;"They're raking in about $80 million a year because it's virtual endoscopy."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"You know, I had an endoscopy recently too."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Anybody else in the crowd have one?"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"""Oh yeah, Eddie."""
01:53:03;01:53:06;"I mean, so that's kind of what it's all about."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"Just one quick question before we go out."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"Is Eddie still pounding red wine on stage?"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"I believe so."
01:53:13;01:53:18;"That is like such a rough beverage on the vocal cords."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"And yet his voice always sounds great."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"Yeah. Should we go out on a Pearl Jam song?"
01:53:24;01:53:29;"Should we do the Pearl Jam's famous hit single live cover?"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Last Kiss?"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"Oh yeah."
01:53:31;01:53:36;"Where, oh where did my baby go be?"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"All right. We'll see you next time."
01:53:39;01:53:44;"Oh where, oh where can my baby be?"
01:53:44;01:53:48;"The Lord took her away from me."
01:53:48;01:53:52;"She's gone to heaven so I ought to be glad."
01:53:52;01:54:00;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world."
01:54:00;01:54:05;"We were out on a date in my daddy's car."
01:54:05;01:54:09;"We hadn't driven very far."
01:54:09;01:54:14;"There in the road straight ahead."
01:54:14;01:54:18;"A car was stalled and the engine was dead."
01:54:18;01:54:22;"I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right."
01:54:22;01:54:26;"I'll never forget the sound that night."
01:54:26;01:54:30;"The screaming tires, the busting glass,"
01:54:30;01:54:36;"the painful scream that I heard last."
01:54:36;01:54:43;"Oh where, oh where can my baby be?"
01:54:43;01:54:47;"The Lord took her away from me."
01:54:47;01:54:51;"She's gone to heaven so I ought to be glad."
01:54:51;01:54:59;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world."
01:54:59;01:55:04;"When I woke up the rain was pouring down."
01:55:04;01:55:08;"There were people standing all around."
01:55:08;01:55:12;"Something warm going through my eyes."
01:55:12;01:55:17;"But somehow I found my baby that night."
01:55:17;01:55:21;"I lifted her head, she looked at me and said,"
01:55:21;01:55:25;"""Hold me darling just a little while."""
01:55:25;01:55:29;"I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss."
01:55:29;01:55:34;"I found the love that I knew I had missed."
01:55:34;01:55:38;"Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight."
01:55:38;01:55:46;"I lost my love, my life that night."
01:55:46;01:55:51;"Oh where, oh where can my baby be?"
01:55:51;01:55:55;"The Lord took her away from me."
01:55:55;01:55:59;"She's gone to heaven so I ought to be glad."
01:55:59;01:56:05;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world."
