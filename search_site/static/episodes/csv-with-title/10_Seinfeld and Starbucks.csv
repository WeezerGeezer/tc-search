00:05;00:07;">> Time Crisis Episode 10."
00:07;00:10;"Wow, can't believe we're here."
00:10;00:13;"Today marks the triumphant return of Jake Longstreth,"
00:13;00:15;"who's been gone for two weeks in China,"
00:15;00:17;"and a new guest on the show,"
00:17;00:19;"writer and comedian Joe Mandi."
00:19;00:23;"I'm going to try to patch things up with Seinfeld 2000,"
00:23;00:27;"but more than anything, I'll be playing great, beautiful music."
00:27;00:32;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:35;"Beast One."
05:55;05:59;"That was Grimes with Flesh Without Blood from her new album Art Angels."
05:59;06:01;"Very hot album, just released."
06:01;06:04;"I'm your host, Ezra Koenig, and I'm joined in the studio by Jake Longstreth."
06:04;06:05;"What's up, Jake?"
06:05;06:06;"Hey, man."
06:06;06:07;"And Joe Mandi, first time on the show."
06:07;06:08;"Yeah, what up?"
06:08;06:09;"What's up, Joe? Who are you, man?"
06:09;06:16;"I'm a writer and comedian, and Wikipedia says ""internet personality,"" which I'm not happy about."
06:16;06:17;"You're a triple threat."
06:17;06:20;"I guess, although the last threat's not much of a threat."
06:20;06:24;"So what kind of writing do you do, like nonfiction, poetry?"
06:24;06:25;"Mostly poetry."
06:25;06:26;"Oh, nice."
06:26;06:29;"But also television writing, sitcoms."
06:29;06:32;"So you wrote on Parks and Rec. I just watched all of Parks and Rec."
06:32;06:33;"The whole thing?"
06:33;06:34;"Yeah."
06:34;06:35;"Wow, that's tight."
06:35;06:37;"I guess over the past, like, four months, but--"
06:37;06:38;"Yeah."
06:38;06:40;"I finished it three days ago."
06:40;06:41;"Well, thank you."
06:41;06:42;"Beautiful program."
06:42;06:43;"Thank you."
06:43;06:44;"Okay."
06:44;06:45;"I jumped the gun a little bit."
06:45;06:46;"It was presumptuous."
06:46;06:47;"I feel like it was crap."
06:47;06:48;"Wonderful program."
06:48;06:51;"And then also, you were just writing on another hit show."
06:51;06:53;"Master of None."
06:53;06:55;"Which is the Aziz Ansari program."
06:55;06:56;"Yes."
06:56;06:57;"Yeah."
06:57;07:00;"This is the best-reviewed program, I think, since Cheers."
07:00;07:01;"Pretty much, yeah."
07:01;07:06;"It's Cheers #1, then Master of None, and then Grace Under Fire."
07:06;07:07;"You guys are killing it."
07:07;07:08;"Yeah."
07:08;07:10;"Jake, so you've been in China for two weeks."
07:10;07:11;"Yeah."
07:11;07:12;"We missed you."
07:12;07:13;"I missed you."
07:13;07:14;"What's going on in China, man?"
07:14;07:15;"What were you doing there?"
07:15;07:19;"I was over in Beijing for an art exhibit that I had paintings in."
07:19;07:20;"Mm-hmm."
07:20;07:24;"And some young art collectors started a museum there,"
07:24;07:29;"and they put together a big show--a big international show of different painters"
07:29;07:34;"from Europe, the States, Philippines, South America, China."
07:34;07:35;"It was very global."
07:35;07:36;"Yeah."
07:36;07:38;"So I was there, and it was great."
07:38;07:40;"What kind of art is hot in China right now?"
07:40;07:42;"I don't--I mean, all kinds."
07:42;07:44;"So you held it down for America?"
07:44;07:45;"Yeah."
07:45;07:47;"It was like maybe three or four Americans."
07:47;07:48;"Uh-huh."
07:48;07:51;"And then I went out to the Great Wall, which was amazing."
07:51;07:53;"The Great Wall of China."
07:53;07:54;"Oh, right."
07:54;07:55;"You're looking at me blankly."
07:55;07:56;"I've heard about it."
07:56;07:57;"You've got to specify."
07:57;07:58;"There's a lot of walls."
07:58;07:59;"Great Wall."
07:59;08:00;"Yeah."
08:00;08:01;"Which is incredible."
08:01;08:02;"Yeah."
08:02;08:04;"What do you do when you go to the Great Wall of China?"
08:04;08:06;"Because it's very long."
08:06;08:07;"You can't walk it."
08:07;08:08;"You can walk part of it."
08:08;08:09;"Walk part of it."
08:09;08:12;"No, I mean, it spans--I was reading about it in Wikipedia when I was there."
08:12;08:16;"There's something like 3,000 miles worth of wall."
08:16;08:17;"No, no, I'm sorry."
08:17;08:19;"It spans 3,000 miles."
08:19;08:21;"But it's actually--because there's switchbacks and stuff,"
08:21;08:23;"it's actually 5,000 miles of wall."
08:23;08:29;"And it was built over 1,000 years to keep the nomadic hordes of people"
08:29;08:33;"from Mongolia who came down to try to take over China again and again."
08:33;08:34;"And eventually did."
08:34;08:38;"So is it like the Brooklyn Bridge where there are people selling soda and stuff?"
08:38;08:39;"Yeah."
08:39;08:40;"Beer, soda, Snickers."
08:40;08:42;"I actually had a beer and a Snickers."
08:42;08:44;"And actually at one point, just one quick story,"
08:44;08:47;"I was in one of those guard posts, and there was a bulletin board"
08:47;08:52;"where you could kind of sign your name, like, ""Timmy plus Jesse, 2009."""
08:52;08:53;"Right."
08:53;08:56;"Someone had written in huge block letters, ""Trump, 2016,"""
08:56;08:59;"which totally threw me for a loop because I was like,"
08:59;09:02;"""Did this person--was this like a sarcastic commentary on Trump"
09:02;09:05;"who is a huge supporter of walls?"""
09:05;09:09;"And then the wall between America and Mexico obviously being like a futile endeavor,"
09:09;09:12;"and the wall between Mongolia and China was obviously--or not."
09:12;09:16;"Or was it just like a straight-up Trump supporter who just failed to see the irony?"
09:16;09:17;"Right."
09:17;09:19;"Or was it a joke from like 10 years ago?"
09:19;09:22;"Like imagine the notion, the thought of him being the president."
09:22;09:23;"Right."
09:23;09:25;"If you're the person who wrote ""Trump, 2016"" on the gray wall of China,"
09:25;09:28;"we'd love to hear from you."
09:28;09:29;"I bet they were being funny."
09:29;09:30;"Oh, who knows?"
09:30;09:31;"You don't know, man."
09:31;09:34;"That's just me in my little downtown New York liberal bubble."
09:34;09:37;"This is the first show for you in November."
09:37;09:39;"You missed our first November show."
09:39;09:41;"We've been trying to keep it a little bit eerie."
09:41;09:42;"I don't know about today."
09:42;09:44;"Today we're going to go all over the place, but I really f---ed up,"
09:44;09:48;"and I didn't play this song last time because this is the ultimate November song."
09:48;09:49;"You know what I'm talking about?"
09:49;09:50;"Wyclef Jean?"
09:50;09:51;"""Rain""?"
09:51;09:52;"Yeah."
09:52;09:53;"November ""Rain."""
09:53;09:54;"Oh, man, there's two November songs."
09:54;09:55;"We'll play both of them."
09:55;09:57;"But yeah, November ""Rain,"" ""Guns N' Roses,"""
09:57;09:59;"and obviously you also made the classic album ""Chinese Democracy,"""
09:59;10:02;"so there's a lot of connections here."
10:02;10:05;"But here's Axl on the boys with ""November Rain."""
10:05;10:08;"It's a long one, but stick around."
10:49;10:52;"[MUSIC - ""WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES""]"
11:17;11:23;"When I look into your eyes, I can see a love restrained."
11:23;11:36;"Darling, when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same?"
11:43;11:48;"Nothing lasts forever, and we both know hearts can change."
11:48;12:00;"And it's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain."
12:00;12:10;"Been through this such a long, long time"
12:10;12:15;"just trying to kill the pain."
12:15;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:20;"Love is always coming."
12:20;12:22;"Love is always going."
12:22;12:27;"No one's really sure of letting go today."
12:27;12:31;"Walking away."
12:31;12:34;"When you take the time to lean on the line,"
12:34;12:39;"I can rest my head just knowing that you are mine."
12:39;12:40;"Oh, mine."
12:40;12:50;"If you want to love me, then darling, don't be afraid."
12:50;13:02;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
13:07;13:13;"Do you need some time on your own?"
13:13;13:19;"Do you need some time all alone?"
13:19;13:25;"Oh, everybody needs some time on their own."
13:25;13:30;"Oh, don't you know you need some time all alone?"
13:33;13:40;"I know it's hard to keep an open heart when even friends"
13:40;13:45;"seem out to harm you."
13:45;13:51;"But if you feel the broken heart,"
13:51;13:55;"wouldn't I be out to charm you?"
13:55;13:55;"Oh."
14:04;14:07;"[VOCALIZING]"
14:13;14:16;"[VOCALIZING]"
14:47;14:53;"Sometimes I need some time on my own."
14:53;14:59;"Sometimes I need some time all alone."
14:59;15:05;"Oh, everybody needs some time on their own."
15:05;15:10;"Oh, don't you know you need some time all alone?"
15:14;15:18;"[VOCALIZING]"
15:41;15:48;"And when your fears subside and shadows still remain,"
15:48;15:49;"oh, yeah."
15:49;15:58;"I know that you can't love me when there's no one left to blame."
16:05;16:08;"So never mind the darkness."
16:08;16:10;"We still can find a way."
16:10;16:22;"Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain."
16:26;16:29;"[VOCALIZING]"
16:56;17:00;"[VOCALIZING]"
17:01;17:04;"[VOCALIZING]"
17:04;17:08;"[VOCALIZING]"
17:11;17:14;"[VOCALIZING]"
17:20;17:42;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
17:42;17:45;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
17:45;17:47;"Everybody needs somebody."
17:47;17:50;"You're not the only one."
17:50;17:53;"You're not the only one."
17:53;17:55;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
17:58;18:01;"Everybody needs somebody."
18:01;18:03;"You're not the only one."
18:06;18:08;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
18:08;18:11;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
18:11;18:14;"Everybody needs somebody."
18:14;18:16;"You're not the only one."
18:16;18:19;"You're not the only one."
18:19;18:21;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
18:21;18:24;"Don't you think that you need somebody?"
18:24;18:27;"Everybody needs somebody."
18:42;18:46;"That was Guns N' Roses with November Rain."
18:46;18:47;"Weird song."
18:47;18:48;"Yeah."
18:48;18:50;"You know that was written in '85?"
18:50;18:51;"I can feel it."
18:51;18:53;"There's-- because that was off the 1991 album,"
18:53;18:54;"Use Your Illusion."
18:54;18:55;"Right."
18:55;18:56;"I forget, one or two, but--"
18:56;18:57;"One."
18:57;19:00;"On YouTube, there's demos of Axl on, like, a four-track"
19:00;19:03;"recording in '85 laying down that song."
19:03;19:05;"And then-- oh, also, Don't Cry, which"
19:05;19:07;"was the other big ballad off that record,"
19:07;19:08;"also from that same period, which"
19:08;19:10;"makes you think that, like, all the-- like,"
19:10;19:14;"Eugene R. Cannon was written within, like, a 12-month"
19:14;19:16;"period in '85 and '86."
19:16;19:17;"It's very possible."
19:17;19:17;"Yeah, yeah."
19:17;19:19;"I thought that was interesting, though,"
19:19;19:21;"that they, like, sat on it for six years."
19:21;19:22;"Well, he wanted to get it perfect."
19:22;19:23;"Right."
19:23;19:25;"But it's also songs like that make you-- you know,"
19:25;19:28;"that song, I think, came out, like, a month before Nevermind."
19:28;19:28;"That's crazy."
19:28;19:30;"Because it reminds you, like, that song is still, like,"
19:30;19:31;"so '80s."
19:31;19:32;"Oh, yeah."
19:32;19:34;"But Guns N' Roses, they knew how to toe that line"
19:34;19:35;"between '80s and '90s."
19:35;19:36;"They stuck around for a minute."
19:36;19:39;"So, Joe, you pointed out before that the other great November"
19:39;19:40;"song is Wyclef."
19:40;19:41;"Are you a Wyclef fan?"
19:41;19:43;"No, it just came to mind, though."
19:43;19:44;"You're not a Wyclef fan?"
19:44;19:45;"I wouldn't say I'm a--"
19:45;19:46;"But I thought you loved hip-hop."
19:46;19:47;"I do, but, yeah."
19:47;19:48;"You don't like the Fugees?"
19:48;19:49;"Love the Fugees."
19:49;19:53;"The individual endeavors, I wasn't-- other than"
19:53;19:55;"Lauryn Hill's album, I wasn't-- I couldn't get behind"
19:55;19:58;"Carnival or whatever."
19:58;19:59;"Proz did."
19:59;20:00;"OK."
20:00;20:01;"Well--"
20:01;20:03;"Is he an investor in beats?"
20:03;20:06;"He's-- he and I have personal business ventures together."
20:06;20:07;"OK."
20:07;20:09;"We're from very near each other in New Jersey."
20:09;20:12;"Well, let's see if this changes your mind a little bit"
20:12;20:13;"when you listen to it again."
20:13;20:16;"Here's Wyclef Jean with ""I'll Be Gone Till November."""
20:16;20:18;"I dedicate this record, ""The Carnival,"" to all you"
20:18;20:23;"brothers taking long trips down south, Virginia, Baltimore,"
20:23;20:25;"all around the world."
20:25;20:28;"And your girl gets this message that you ain't coming back."
20:28;20:30;"She's sitting back in her room."
20:30;20:31;"The lights is off."
20:31;20:32;"She's crying."
20:32;20:36;"And then my voice comes in, pow, in the middle of the night."
20:36;20:38;"And this is what I told her for you."
20:38;20:44;"Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry."
20:44;20:49;"I ask myself why, oh, why."
20:49;20:55;"See, you must understand I can't work a 9 to 5."
20:55;20:59;"So I'll be gone till November."
20:59;21:01;"Said I'll be gone till November."
21:01;21:03;"I'll be gone till November."
21:03;21:05;"You tell my girl, you I'll be gone till November."
21:05;21:06;"I'll be gone till November."
21:06;21:08;"I'll be gone till November."
21:08;21:11;"You tell my girl, you I'll be gone till November."
21:11;21:14;"January, February, March, April, May."
21:14;21:16;"I see you crying, but girl, I can't stay."
21:16;21:18;"I'll be gone till November."
21:18;21:20;"I'll be gone till November."
21:20;21:22;"And give a kiss to my brother."
21:22;21:25;"When I come back, there'll be no need to clock."
21:25;21:28;"I have enough money to buy out blocks."
21:28;21:30;"Tell my brother go to school in September"
21:30;21:33;"so he won't mess up in summer school in the summer."
21:33;21:36;"Tell my cousin Jerry wear his condom."
21:36;21:39;"If you don't wear condom, you see a red line."
21:39;21:40;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
21:40;21:41;"You suck at MCs."
21:41;21:43;"You got no flow."
21:43;21:45;"I heard you style you SOSO."
21:45;21:51;"Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry."
21:51;21:56;"I ask myself why, oh, why."
21:56;22:02;"See, you must understand I can't work a nine to five."
22:02;22:06;"So I'll be gone till November."
22:06;22:08;"Said I'll be gone till November."
22:08;22:10;"I'll be gone till November."
22:10;22:12;"You tell my girl, you I'll be gone till November."
22:12;22:13;"I'll be gone till November."
22:13;22:15;"I'll be gone till November."

22:21;22:23;"I see you crying, but girl, I can't stay."
22:23;22:25;"I'll be gone till November."
22:25;22:27;"I'll be gone till November."
22:27;22:29;"You'll give a kiss to my mother."
22:29;22:32;"I had to flip nothing and turn it into something."
22:32;22:35;"Hip hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pump."
22:35;22:38;"Commit treason, then I have a reason to hunt you down."
22:38;22:40;"It's holy right, it's rap this season."
22:40;22:43;"I hear you with a loud voice, posing like the top choice."
22:43;22:46;"Your voice, I make the hearse out of your Rolls Royce."
22:46;22:49;"Besides, I got my girl to remember."
22:49;22:52;"And I committed that I'll be back in November."
22:52;22:58;"Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry."
22:58;23:04;"I ask myself why, oh, why."
23:04;23:10;"See, you must understand I can't work a nine to five."
23:10;23:13;"Girl, I'll be gone till November."
23:13;23:15;"And I'll be gone till November."
23:15;23:17;"I'll be gone till November."
23:17;23:19;"You tell my girl I'll be gone till November."
23:19;23:21;"I'll be gone till November."

23:30;23:32;"I'll be gone till November."
23:33;23:36;"You'll give a kiss to my mother."
23:36;23:41;"I know the hustle's hard, but we got to enterprise the carnival."

26:30;26:53;"That was Jacques Dutranc with ""Hippie Hippie Hoorah."""
26:53;26:56;"I wanted to play that song because I've always loved it,"
26:56;26:59;"and now it's coming to prominence again because it's used in ""Master of None."""
26:59;27:00;"Correct, yeah."
27:00;27:02;"The Aziz program that Joe Mandi wrote on."
27:02;27:03;"Yeah."
27:03;27:05;"It's such a weird, vibey song."
27:05;27:06;"I love '60s French music."
27:06;27:08;"The music's great on the show."
27:08;27:09;"I had no part in it."
27:09;27:10;"Yeah, can we talk about that for a second?"
27:10;27:12;"'Cause I'm a music industry professional."
27:12;27:13;"Sure."
27:13;27:16;"I would guess that based on some of the sync--"
27:16;27:17;"we call these syncs in the business."
27:17;27:18;"Sure."
27:18;27:19;"'Cause I've been on both sides of it."
27:19;27:21;"Sometimes I'm trying to get a sync for something,"
27:21;27:24;"and sometimes people ask me for a Vampire Weekend song."
27:24;27:25;"Right."
27:25;27:26;"And I'm like, ""I'm not doing a film or a program."""
27:26;27:28;"You know, sometimes you can get stuff for cheap,"
27:28;27:32;"but the hard thing to get for cheap are, like, these older songs."
27:32;27:34;"Because, for instance, ""Walk on the Wild Side"" by Lou Reed."
27:34;27:36;"Lou Reed is dead, rest in peace."
27:36;27:39;"Whoever's controlling that estate would probably not have any reason"
27:39;27:41;"to give it to Aziz's show for cheap."
27:41;27:47;"So there's that song, there's some, like, really classic hip-hop."
27:47;27:51;"I would guess that the music budget for that show, $20 million."
27:51;27:54;"I can't answer that 'cause I don't know."
27:54;27:59;"I had nothing to do with it, but I can text Aziz and ask how much the music budget was."
27:59;28:00;"Please text Aziz."
28:00;28:01;"Hopefully he'll write back later and we'll find out."
28:01;28:02;"Yeah."
28:02;28:03;"Was it $20 million?"
28:03;28:04;"Was it more?"
28:04;28:06;"Was it $30 million?"
28:06;28:09;"He just wrote back an infinity symbol."
28:09;28:10;"Oh, boy."
28:10;28:11;"So, yeah."
28:11;28:12;"Wow."
28:12;28:15;"That's the power he's--that's how much power he has at Netflix."
28:15;28:17;"There's literally just money still rolling out from that."
28:17;28:21;"Let's listen to some more music, some more French music from the '60s."
28:21;28:22;"French Montana."
28:22;28:23;"No, okay."
28:23;28:24;"We'll listen to some French Montana later."
28:24;28:25;"Cool."
28:25;28:26;"I would appreciate that."
28:26;28:27;"This is some classic French '60s."
28:27;28:29;"This is something everybody likes to listen to."
28:29;28:31;"This is Françoise Hardy."
28:31;28:34;"I think that's how the French people say it with ""Tous les garçons et les filles."""

35:17;35:22;"- What's going on in the Big Apple?"
35:22;35:23;"You guys ready to find out?"
35:23;35:27;"Have you heard about this Shia LaBeouf screening?"
35:27;35:29;"Shia LaBeouf is screening all of his films"
35:29;35:31;"at the Angelica Film Center,"
35:31;35:34;"a wonderful theater in downtown Manhattan."
35:34;35:36;"He's watching them chronologically,"

35:45;35:46;"- That's crazy."
35:46;35:47;"- That doesn't make any sense to me."
35:47;35:48;"- No."
35:48;35:49;"- That sounds like a lie."
35:49;35:50;"- If I had known earlier,"
35:50;35:51;"I would have flown out for this."
35:51;35:53;"- I mean, he's been in many great films."
35:53;35:55;"What are you guys' favorite Shia films?"
35:55;35:57;"- Holes, number one with a bullet, Holes."
35:57;35:58;"- Holes?"
35:58;35:59;"- What's that?"
35:59;36:00;"- Holes?"
36:00;36:02;"- Holes, it was, he was still a child."
36:02;36:04;"It was a movie about he and a bunch of kids"
36:04;36:06;"digging holes in the ground."
36:06;36:07;"- Oh, I like it."
36:07;36:08;"- 'Cause that's my,"
36:08;36:09;"that's where he was great, that era."
36:09;36:11;"- Yeah, a lot of people forget that he was a child actor."
36:11;36:14;"- I watched even Stevens on the reg when I was in college."
36:14;36:15;"I loved that show."
36:15;36:16;"- That was a child's program."
36:16;36:17;"- Weird to admit that I would get stoned"
36:17;36:19;"and watch a Disney channel,"
36:19;36:20;"but I would be like,"
36:20;36:22;"this kid has perfect comedic timing."
36:22;36:24;"He's a great actor."
36:24;36:25;"- You should have started managing him."
36:25;36:26;"- I really should have."
36:26;36:27;"- You're too stoned."
36:27;36:29;"- I know, and I was 19."
36:29;36:31;"- Jake, what's your favorite Chi film?"
36:31;36:32;"- I'm struggling to think of one."
36:32;36:33;"- Oh, come on."
36:33;36:34;"- Disturbia?"
36:34;36:35;"- Yeah."
36:36;36:37;"- Anyone, anyone?"
36:37;36:38;"- That's right."
36:38;36:39;"- And then there's the one."
36:39;36:40;"- Also Rihanna's song."
36:40;36:41;"- That came out a few years ago,"
36:41;36:42;"kind of came and went."
36:42;36:44;"It's like a journalist film with Robert Redford."
36:44;36:46;"- Oh, I vaguely remember that."
36:46;36:47;"- It's good."
36:47;36:48;"It's a really generic title"
36:48;36:49;"that you would forget immediately."
36:49;36:50;"That's why I'm not remembering,"
36:50;36:51;"but it's like a straightforward"
36:51;36:53;"sort of like journalistic thriller."
36:53;36:54;"- That's tight."
36:54;36:55;"He's a great actor."
36:55;36:56;"- No, I think he's talented."
36:56;36:57;"- And a great freestyle rapper."
36:57;36:58;"I don't know if you've seen that."
36:58;36:59;"- Yeah, I saw the video."
36:59;37:00;"He's a good dude."
37:00;37:01;"I've met him a couple times."
37:01;37:04;"One time was Vampire Weekend was on tour."
37:04;37:06;"We played a show in Amsterdam,"
37:06;37:08;"and Kid Cudi came to the show,"
37:08;37:09;"and he had a bunch of people with him,"
37:09;37:10;"one of whom was Shia,"
37:10;37:12;"who at the time was like making a video."
37:12;37:13;"- Okay."
37:13;37:14;"- I don't know."
37:14;37:16;"- But he was a part of Cudi's crew?"
37:16;37:18;"- Yes, actors and rappers love to hang out."
37:18;37:19;"Everybody knows this."
37:19;37:20;"- Yeah."
37:20;37:21;"- So they were there in Amsterdam together,"
37:21;37:22;"and they came backstage,"
37:22;37:24;"and everybody knows that a Vampire Weekend"
37:24;37:25;"backstage scenario was very boring."
37:25;37:27;"So they came, we chatted a little bit,"
37:27;37:29;"and then they left very quickly."
37:29;37:31;"But, you know, Shia seemed like a nice guy."
37:31;37:32;"Kid Cudi seemed like a nice guy."
37:32;37:34;"And then the next morning,"
37:34;37:36;"I was catching a very early flight by myself"
37:36;37:38;"'cause I needed a break,"
37:38;37:41;"and I went down to the hotel breakfast buffet."
37:41;37:43;"Around 6 a.m. it was very dark,"
37:43;37:44;"and it was fully empty,"
37:44;37:47;"and then a figure emerged and came in,"
37:47;37:48;"and it was Shia,"
37:48;37:49;"and it was just the two of us"
37:49;37:53;"in this like super awkward Dutch breakfast buffet."
37:53;37:56;"- And I'm guessing he had been out all night."
37:56;37:58;"- Unclear. - Unclear, okay."
37:58;38:00;"- Unclear, I had definitely just woken up."
38:00;38:01;"It was like still dark outside."
38:01;38:02;"- Right."
38:02;38:03;"- So then at 6 a.m. we just like sat,"
38:03;38:05;"and I was kind of like, ""Oh, should we--"
38:05;38:06;"""Can I join you?"""
38:06;38:07;"Would have seemed weird for us"
38:07;38:08;"to just like not sit together,"
38:08;38:09;"we were the only people there."
38:09;38:10;"And then we sat and chatted,"
38:10;38:12;"and I remember he was wrapping up Transformers."
38:12;38:13;"I had a lot of questions about that."
38:13;38:17;"- So that was right after it came out or before?"
38:17;38:18;"- It must have been like around the time"
38:18;38:19;"of the last movie or something."
38:19;38:20;"- Mm-hmm."
38:20;38:22;"- And he seemed like a very interesting guy,"
38:22;38:24;"and then I ran into him at a coffee bean"
38:24;38:25;"not too long ago, and I said, ""What's up?"""
38:25;38:27;"And he remembered me, and he was very polite,"
38:27;38:28;"and you know what?"
38:28;38:29;"I'll always root for Shia."
38:29;38:31;"- Me too, I'm a huge fan."
38:31;38:35;"- And I don't like people trying to question his motives."
38:35;38:36;"- No, I mean, I'd be happy--"
38:36;38:39;"I want to write the Evan Stevens movie."
38:39;38:40;"- Oh, that's a good idea."
38:40;38:41;"- Bring him back."
38:41;38:42;"- Maybe there should be--"
38:42;38:45;"like Netflix will reboot Evan Stevens."
38:45;38:46;"- I would die."
38:46;38:47;"- Maybe a little bit darker."
38:47;38:48;"- Definitely darker."
38:48;38:49;"- Throw in some Lou Reed songs."
38:49;38:50;"- Right."
38:50;38:51;"- We love you, Shia."

41:00;41:02;"- ""Happy holidays."" - ""Happy holidays."""

42:58;42:59;"I like everything about it,"

43:01;43:02;"who's actually raised"
43:02;43:04;"at least some type of Christian household"
43:04;43:05;"with what's going on now?"
43:05;43:07;"Because this is what's in the news,"
43:07;43:10;"is that Starbucks made these disgusting red cups."
43:10;43:13;"They used to have more, like, Christmas-y stuff,"
43:13;43:16;"and then I don't know how they even picked the color red."
43:16;43:18;"Has nothing to do with Christmas."
43:18;43:19;"It's horrible."
43:19;43:20;"So then they do these weird--"
43:20;43:21;"- It's one of the three."
43:21;43:22;"- One of the three what?"
43:22;43:23;"- Colors of Christmas."
43:23;43:24;"- I don't know."
43:24;43:25;"It's the communist color."
43:25;43:27;"So Starbucks, for some insane reason,"
43:27;43:28;"chooses to make these red cups"
43:28;43:29;"instead of, like, you know,"
43:29;43:31;"something that actually represents Christmas."
43:31;43:32;"- What do they say on there?"
43:32;43:33;"Anything?"
43:33;43:34;"It's just red?"
43:34;43:35;"- No, it's just red."
43:35;43:36;"- Oh, no, it says ""Happy Holidays,"
43:36;43:38;"""in place of Merry Christmas."""
43:38;43:39;"- This is pure propaganda."
43:39;43:41;"- No, no, no, it's just red."
43:41;43:42;"- This is pure propaganda."
43:42;43:44;"They never said ""Merry Christmas."""
43:44;43:45;"- This cup's never said ""Merry Christmas""?"
43:45;43:47;"- Starbucks released a statement, never said it."
43:47;43:49;"- Well, one thing that I found interesting"
43:49;43:52;"is that one of the guys who kind of started the boycott--"
43:52;43:53;"or not the boycott Starbucks,"
43:53;43:57;"his whole idea was instead of boycotting Starbucks,"
43:57;43:59;"you should go in there and tell them"
43:59;44:00;"that your name is Merry Christmas."
44:00;44:01;"Let's listen to a clip of this guy,"
44:01;44:03;"'cause he made a video on Facebook"
44:03;44:04;"that kind of kicked it all off."
44:04;44:06;"- Hey, guys, what's up? Josh Bernstein here."
44:06;44:08;"You know, I think in the age of political correctness,"
44:08;44:09;"we become so open-minded,"
44:09;44:11;"our brains have literally fallen out of our head."
44:11;44:14;"Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ"
44:14;44:17;"and Christmas off of their brand-new cups?"
44:17;44:18;"That's why they're just plain red."
44:18;44:20;"In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn't allowed"
44:20;44:22;"to say ""Merry Christmas"" to customers?"
44:22;44:24;"Well, I decided, instead of simply boycotting,"
44:24;44:26;"well, why don't we just start a movement?"
44:26;44:28;"So when I went in and I asked for my coffee,"
44:28;44:29;"they asked for my name,"
44:29;44:32;"and I told them, ""My name is Merry Christmas."""
44:32;44:35;"So guess what? Starbucks, I tricked you"
44:35;44:38;"into putting Merry Christmas on your cup."
44:38;44:42;"- So this guy, he's saying that you should go into Starbucks"
44:42;44:44;"and order your coffee and say your name is Merry Christmas,"
44:44;44:47;"forcing the anti-Christian maniacs"
44:47;44:49;"to write Merry Christmas on the cup."
44:49;44:52;"I feel bad that this evangelical Christian man"
44:52;44:55;"who's fighting back in the war on Christmas"
44:55;44:58;"had the misfortune to be named Joshua Feuerstein,"
44:58;45:01;"because, look, these are just German names,"
45:01;45:04;"I guess, Feuerstein, but that sounds mad Jewish."
45:04;45:06;"- Crazy. Joshua. - Joshua Feuerstein."
45:06;45:08;"- Joshua Feuerstein. - Or ""Four-steen."""
45:08;45:09;"I bet Starbucks thought they were just doing something"
45:09;45:11;"kind of cool and minimalist. - No."
45:11;45:13;"- Like, ""This year, instead of a picture of a polar bear"
45:13;45:16;"""licking a candy cane, we're gonna make a red cup."""
45:16;45:19;"- Yo, also, they still make Christmas blend coffee."
45:19;45:21;"You order Christmas blend coffee for the full month."
45:21;45:22;"- Really? - Yeah, so this is absurd."
45:22;45:24;"- Okay, I didn't know that. Okay, so--"
45:24;45:26;"Okay, you're honestly making me stop and question"
45:26;45:27;"this war on Christmas thing."
45:27;45:28;"And you can still go in there--"
45:28;45:31;"They have, like, holiday-themed cookies and stuff."
45:31;45:32;"You can find Christmas in Starbucks."
45:32;45:34;"- They're very pro-Christmas in Starbucks."
45:34;45:35;"This is a very weird boycott."
45:35;45:37;"- Yeah, you know what bothers me is I love--"
45:37;45:39;"even though I'm not a Christian,"
45:39;45:41;"Christianity is one of my top three favorite religions."
45:41;45:42;"I'm not gonna say the other two"
45:42;45:44;"because I don't wanna get competitive,"
45:44;45:46;"but Christianity's always one of my favorite religions."
45:46;45:49;"I love the New Testament and the Bible."
45:49;45:50;"I love Christianity."
45:50;45:53;"I love Christian liturgical music."
45:53;45:54;"It's one of my favorite religions."
45:54;45:56;"- Gospel music? - Gospel music."
45:56;45:57;"I'm very lucky that I was raised"
45:57;45:59;"in a primarily Christian country 'cause I love it."
45:59;46:01;"But I don't like this because this is, like,"
46:01;46:04;"this weird battle to fight, whereas I always loved"
46:04;46:06;"to put the Christ back in Christmas."
46:06;46:08;"Because I do, I do really admire Jesus,"
46:08;46:11;"and I love the idea that people would turn it"
46:11;46:13;"into an anti-materialism thing."
46:13;46:15;"So I would-- - Yeah, that's the real irony."
46:15;46:18;"- I love when I see real Christian people"
46:18;46:21;"who are protesting, like, big box stores,"
46:21;46:22;"and they're like, ""You know what?"
46:22;46:24;"""We're getting a little bit materialistic."""
46:24;46:25;"- Jesus would hate Christmas."
46:25;46:26;"- He would hate Black Friday."
46:26;46:30;"- He would hate Walmart being open on Thanksgiving."
46:30;46:31;"- Yeah, so I love that."
46:31;46:33;"I think there is a Christmas war to fight."
46:33;46:34;"- That's what I'm saying, dude."
46:34;46:35;"- That's the war."
46:35;46:36;"All right, I got my eye on you, Joe."
46:36;46:37;"I don't know."
46:37;46:38;"I guess we should probably listen"
46:38;46:39;"to some Christmas music now."
46:39;46:40;"- Oh, God, really?"
46:40;46:42;"- Well, it's after Halloween."
46:42;46:45;"I mean, I made it to deep November without playing any--"
46:45;46:46;"- Can I request a song?"
46:46;46:47;"- Yeah, what's your favorite Christmas song?"
46:47;46:49;"- ""Dipset Christmas"" with Jim Jones."
46:49;46:50;"- Okay."
46:50;46:52;"""Dipset Christmas"" by Jim Jones."
46:52;46:53;"- This song rules."
46:53;46:55;"It's gonna be a good Christmas this year."

54:20;54:21;"Big time."
54:21;54:24;"Okay, so Joe and Jake and everybody who's listening,"
54:24;54:27;"you guys were on the show last week, or two weeks ago."
54:27;54:32;"I had a guest on the show, one of my favorite Twitter accounts,"
54:32;54:34;"@Seinfeld2000."
54:34;54:36;"He has a Twitter where he imagines what Seinfeld"
54:36;54:38;"would be like if it was on the air today."
54:38;54:41;"And I invited him on, and it started out fine,"
54:41;54:43;"but things got a little bit weird."
54:43;54:45;"And I want to apologize to everybody who's listening"
54:45;54:47;"because it was uncomfortable."
54:47;54:51;"He really was insisting that Seinfeld was coming back on the air."
54:51;54:53;"It made me feel strange."
54:53;54:56;"My guests that week were two people who were actually on TV,"
54:56;54:59;"and it was kind of offensive that he would suggest that he knew more"
54:59;55:01;"about what was happening on TV than them."
55:01;55:03;"And also, it just wasn't happening."
55:03;55:05;"So things got weird."
55:05;55:07;"I certainly overreacted."
55:07;55:09;"I want to admit that I overreacted."
55:09;55:13;"I cut him off, I threw him off the show, and I got angry."
55:13;55:18;"So I think we were both to blame in this circumstance."
55:18;55:24;"But nobody wants to have enemies, and I truly think he's a hilarious guy."
55:24;55:27;"So I reached out to Seinfeld2000 offline,"
55:27;55:29;"which is the real way to settle problems, and we talked,"
55:29;55:32;"and we realized, okay, there was a miscommunication."
55:32;55:36;"And I'm very happy to say that he's coming back on the show today."
55:36;55:37;"We hashed everything out."
55:37;55:39;"So, Jerry, are you there?"
55:39;55:41;"Hello?"
55:41;55:43;"Hey, are you there, man?"
55:43;55:45;"Hey, sorry, I've got to stop this."
55:45;55:49;"Sorry, you can't be--I was actually watching an episode of Seinfeld."
55:49;55:51;"So it's not a new episode."
55:51;55:53;"It's the gum."
55:53;55:57;"I've probably seen it like 6,000 times, but it'll have to do, I guess,"
55:57;56:00;"until Seinfeld legitimately is back on TV with the episode."
56:00;56:03;"If one day, fingers crossed, it comes back,"
56:03;56:05;"but we know that that's not happening now."
56:05;56:06;"Yeah."
56:06;56:08;"Is it on Hulu or something?"
56:08;56:10;"It's on Hulu, but they're not making new ones."
56:10;56:12;"Those aren't new episodes."
56:12;56:17;"They're the classics from back in the day, obviously."
56:17;56:22;"Anyway, listen, Ezra, first of all, happy 10th show."
56:22;56:23;"Thank you."
56:23;56:25;"It's the 10th anniversary of Time Crisis."
56:25;56:26;"Congratulations."
56:26;56:27;"Thank you very much."
56:27;56:30;"On the 10th anniversary."
56:30;56:34;"Can I take a moment to actually straight-up apologize to you on the air?"
56:34;56:37;"Wow, well, yeah, I wasn't expecting that, but thanks, man, of course."
56:37;56:41;"I guess this is like a Seinfeld 2000 exclusive apology right here on Time Crisis,"
56:41;56:43;"Beachfront on Apple Music."
56:43;56:46;"I feel like I wanted to come across like a Jerry,"
56:46;56:48;"but I was acting more like a Newman."
56:48;56:50;"Does that make sense?"
56:50;56:53;"I get it, man, and I just want to let you know that all is forgiven,"
56:53;56:55;"and I'm sorry for overreacting."
56:55;56:58;"I was out of line, too, so I consider you a friend."
56:58;57:00;"Things are cool between us."
57:00;57:01;"Awesome."
57:01;57:08;"I guess just like the new Justin Bieber song says in the title, I apologize."
57:08;57:09;"Okay."
57:09;57:11;"I think it's sorry, but I appreciate that."
57:11;57:15;"Okay, so I just wanted to actually, with a bit of a peace offering,"
57:15;57:18;"because, you know, my stepdad always said, like,"
57:18;57:21;"don't show up empty-handed to a party."
57:21;57:24;"So I thought we could go back to basics,"
57:24;57:27;"and I've actually just brought you the fruits of my imagination,"
57:27;57:30;"like what I do best, like what we can act over."
57:30;57:34;"So I don't know if you've got your mobile phone handy,"
57:34;57:37;"but I just DMed you via Twitter."
57:37;57:39;"Oh, you DMed me? Okay."
57:39;57:42;"Yeah, I just sent you a DM of a bit of a scene,"
57:42;57:46;"actually, you know, of what Seinfeld would be like."
57:46;57:49;"You know, I usually do what it would be like if it was modern,"
57:49;57:52;"but actually this time I'm doing it like I'm flashing forward."
57:52;57:54;"I'm giving you something a little different,"
57:54;57:58;"and this is what Seinfeld would be like in 2017, just as per my imagination."
57:58;58:00;"Okay, so this is a little scene you wrote"
58:00;58:02;"about what Seinfeld would be like in 2017."
58:02;58:06;"I love it, because this is what I find funny about your account."
58:06;58:10;"I love the imagination when you say how Seinfeld would be different."
58:10;58:12;"So this is an interesting twist, 2017."
58:12;58:14;"Okay, so it's in my DMs."
58:14;58:18;"Yeah, it's called The Galaxy, is the title of the galaxy."
58:18;58:20;"The galaxy, okay."
58:20;58:23;"The galaxy, and I was hoping you could do, you know, like the stage directions,"
58:23;58:26;"like not the character--well, you can do Jerry as well,"
58:26;58:29;"but just like if you can narrate, because I'm on the phone,"
58:29;58:34;"I think the quality is probably not as good, like not as studio crisp."
58:34;58:37;"Okay, sure, I'll read it. I'm getting my DMs."
58:37;58:40;"Okay, here's The Galaxy by Seinfeld 2000."
58:40;58:44;"I love it. This is an idea about what Seinfeld would be like in 2017."
58:44;58:46;"I'm going to start reading, okay?"
58:46;58:47;"Yeah."
58:47;58:51;"The curtain raises, and we are looking at Jerry's apartment."
58:51;58:55;"Okay, usually there's not a curtain on the Seinfeld set, but okay."
58:55;58:56;"Okay."
58:56;58:59;"That's not--I mean, it doesn't say in the script to like question--"
58:59;59:01;"Okay, I'm sorry. Let me just read it. I'm sorry."
59:01;59:03;"Yeah, please proceed. Yeah, go ahead."
59:03;59:06;"The curtain raises, and we are looking at Jerry's apartment."
59:06;59:11;"Jerry is there with his squad of GFs, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne,"
59:11;59:14;"and Mulva's daughter."
59:14;59:18;"His hair is a vibrant fuchsia styled up into the dominant trend of 2017,"
59:18;59:23;"the double man bun, and he is sipping on a guava milk omega-3 smoothie."
59:23;59:27;"Even though he's well over 60, he looks fly as [bleep]"
59:27;59:32;"In the background, Cram is immersed in a virtual realty game on Oculus Rift,"
59:32;59:36;"and he's flailing wildly about its classic Cram."
59:36;59:37;"Classic?"
59:37;59:38;"Wait, I'm sorry."
59:38;59:40;"Can you see it like--huh?"
59:40;59:43;"Yeah, yeah, but it's--you wrote virtual realty."
59:43;59:46;"I imagine that's supposed to be virtual reality."
59:46;59:50;"No, it's a real estate simulation game."
59:50;59:52;"Cram is trying to get his real estate license,"
59:52;59:56;"and I don't think--was it clear that this is 2017?"
59:56;59:57;"Okay."
59:57;59:59;"He's getting his license. It's a simulation."
59:59;01:00:00;"It's a virtual realty."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"On an Oculus Rift. Okay."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Yeah, I can see how that might be a bit confusing,"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"but no, it's a virtual realty game."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"That's where I found it."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"It'll be everywhere in a couple years."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Yeah."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"So Cram is playing a virtual realty game on Oculus Rift."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Okay, let me keep going."
01:00:13;01:00:17;"Elaine is there too, chilling out with the guys from Ray Shremard."
01:00:17;01:00:21;"She can't remember which member of Ray Shremard she is dating."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"The whole gang is all in Jerry Cribb,"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"except for suddenly Gurge bursts into the apartment."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"He's so excited that he literally smashes directly"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"through the locked apartment door."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Yeah, and can--one of your producers could add a smashing,"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"like a real aggressive, kind of like a wooden door."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"Okay, guys, let's get a big smashing sound."
01:00:41;01:00:47;"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"You know, this goes on for a second time."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"Okay, okay."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"I'll do a shorter version, but he's yelling for a minute."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"I'll do it."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"All right, so then I'll be Jerry responding."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Hey, Gurge, what are you holding in your hand?"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"The camera zooms in on Gurge's hand."
01:00:57;01:01:02;"He's holding the Samsung Galaxy S9 Edge plus smartphone,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"Samsung's thinnest yet."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"It's the latest version of the product that drove Apple"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"completely out of business in Q4 of 2016."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"Okay, okay."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"Is this a joke?"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"No, why are you stopping?"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"I'm stopping because you know that we're on the Apple stage,"
01:01:19;01:01:23;"we're on the Apple station, so this is supposed to be a joke"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"that Samsung drove Apple out of business in 2016?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yep, guess what?"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I'm still mad that you cut me off on your last show,"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"""Soul and Revenge."""
01:01:31;01:01:35;"I basically got you to advertise Samsung on Apple Music right now."

01:01:37;01:01:39;"Okay, cut him, cut him, cut him, cut him."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"You just got owned on your own show."

01:07:35;01:07:36;"She's a hero, yeah."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"And you know her primary residence is in Switzerland."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Really?"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"She moved there with her husband, Mutt Lang."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Before the Vegas residency, she split her time"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"between her house on Lake Geneva in Switzerland"
01:07:47;01:07:51;"and a, like, 10,000-acre sheep farm in New Zealand."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"That's a life, wow."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"She got the hell out of Canada."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"Yeah, she got the hell out of Canada"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"and became a American country singer."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"And isn't her husband Mutt Lang a super reclusive dude?"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Yeah, they split up."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"Oh, they did?"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"They split up, which is very sad,"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"although maybe that's what they had to do."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"We don't know."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"My understanding is that because they have children together"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"and they're very wealthy, they built a kind of double house"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"so that they don't have to, like, live as man and wife,"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"but they can kind of share space"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and the kids can run back and forth."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"That's what Affleck's doing."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Oh, really?"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"Yeah."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"He's building a double house?"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"Rich people got it figured out, man."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Build two houses."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Square footage."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"It's very difficult for the children of divorce"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"when their parents can't afford to build a double house."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"That's true."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"And not getting a double house is really tough."
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Or maybe that's weird as hell."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"If you're, like, divorced parents"
01:08:44;01:08:48;"who are just living in, like, different wings of a double house,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"like, when your dad has, like, a free weekend,"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"you can kind of see through the curtains"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"that your dad's, like, boning some lady that's not your mom."

01:09:40;01:09:42;"Well, I thought I'd mix it up."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"I mean, when I was in China, I was on a panel discussion"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"with some Chinese artists there,"
01:09:48;01:09:51;"and I was struck by the discussion between them,"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"and it was a very political discussion they were having."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"And there was a lot of urgency in their disagreements,"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"and they were talking about sort of the role of tradition,"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"the role of national identity,"
01:10:03;01:10:07;"the role of outside influence from the West and sort of globalization,"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"and some artists were very much holding on to the traditions"
01:10:10;01:10:14;"and some artists were very adamant that they should sort of move forward"
01:10:14;01:10:19;"and, like, just, you know, become sort of like other international artists"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"and kind of let the past be the past."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"And, like, they were talking about it so intensely,"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"and there were such, like-- or there seemed to be very high stakes"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"in what they were discussing."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"And then comparatively, the American and European artists"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"were very, like, sort of aloof, unopinionated."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"They were just checking Instagram the whole time?"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Yeah, just sort of, like, a little more checked out,"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"and, like, the concerns were sort of more, like, esoteric and aesthetic."
01:10:42;01:10:45;"And it just got me thinking about, like, oh, well, there was a time"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"in America and in the West where, like, people made political art."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"There were big artists making political art,"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"writing songs about war, death, inner city, whatever."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Mm-hmm."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"So I don't know. I just thought I would, like--"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"last night I was, like, looking up some political songs,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"and actually last time I was on the show, we were talking about 1979."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Right, yeah."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"And weirdly, I found some more songs from then."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Because I guess, like, if you're doing political songs,"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"there's, like-- one approach would be very broad,"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"which would be, like, John Lennon, ""Imagine,"" which is sort of, like--"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Just, like, imagine if the world was better."
01:11:13;01:11:17;"Yeah, like, yeah, there was no materialism, no religion, no nationalism."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Right."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"And that's cool. I can get-- you know, that's kind of an interesting thing,"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"or, like, a band like Fugazi would do a lot of songs"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"about, like, anti-corporatism, anti-materialism."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"And that's cool."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"I liked it when artists-- or I found it very interesting"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"when artists get super specific."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Yeah."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"So I found two songs from 1979."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"One is called ""California Uber Alice"" by the Dead Kennedys."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Oh, that's from 1979."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"Yeah, that's actually their first recording."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Oh, yeah, I love this song."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"I used to cover this song with my middle school punk band."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"That's amazing."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"I don't think I fully understood the implication,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"because the title is ""California Uber Alice,"""
01:11:50;01:11:52;"which is a riff on ""Deutschland Uber Alice,"""
01:11:52;01:11:54;"which is, like, a Nazi thing."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"So I was, like, playing at, like, some barbecue or something,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"like, ""California Uber Alice."""
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Your mom was like, ""What?"""
01:12:00;01:12:02;"It's, like, this weird riff on, like, the Nazis."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"Oh, I thought it was about the taxi service."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"So I'm way off."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"This is back in the era when, like, the punks just hated the hippies."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Right."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Which, like, looking back, it's kind of weird, too."
01:12:13;01:12:17;"Like, they're both sort of progressive and counterculture."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Left-wing."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Different music, but, like, why the beef?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Right."
01:12:21;01:12:24;"And I think this song is, like, sort of meant as, like, a joke,"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"but I feel like this song is basically, like,"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"a working-class punk dude calling out what he sees"
01:12:29;01:12:32;"to be, like, these, like, bougie, politically correct,"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"progressive types who are in power."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Let's listen to this song."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Yeah, let's listen to this."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Let's not just talk politics."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"Let's listen to some political music."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"Here's the Dead Kennedys of ""California Uber Alice."""
01:12:40;01:12:43;"# I am Governor Cherry Brown"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"# I are a smile that never crowns"

01:15:04;01:15:10;"Break your neck, spit Regular phown"
01:15:10;01:15:13;"California will spank us"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"California will spank us"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"California will spank us"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"California will spank us"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"California will spank us California will spank us"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Ha ha ha ha ha!"
01:15:42;01:15:45;"That was the Dead Kennedys with California Uber Alice. Jake, you got some more political music?"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"I love it. These are political times. It's good to remember"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"some of the great political music from the past."
01:15:51;01:15:56;"And I guess what I was thinking about was like, if you write a song about a super specific political context"
01:15:56;01:16:02;"you're really kind of rolling the dice with how history is gonna end up looking at that in the future."
01:16:02;01:16:02;"Right."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"You don't know how things are gonna play out."
01:16:04;01:16:09;"In Jello Biafra's case, I mean that song is like, I think it was kind of a joke at the time"
01:16:09;01:16:13;"but it ends up looking pretty foolish in retrospect. Great song, love the song."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Right."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"But it's like kind of like a funny, brash thing to do."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"It's a little dated."
01:16:19;01:16:22;"And then, so the other song I was thinking about was Bob Marley's Zimbabwe."
01:16:22;01:16:25;"I said it like the song, Zimbabwe."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Right, American people say Zimbabwe."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"Zimbabwe."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"What's the correct pronunciation?"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"No, I was saying-"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"You were saying it in like Bob Marley's Jamaican accent."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Zimbabwe."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"Oh, I see. Zimbabwe."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"I got insecure that I've been saying it wrong forever."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"The accepted American pronunciation is Zimbabwe."
01:16:42;01:16:42;"Yeah."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"This is also from 1979."
01:16:44;01:16:50;"Yeah, yeah. And that was sort of like, you know, there were like Marxist, Leninist rebels and guerrillas"
01:16:50;01:16:55;"that were trying to take over the minority white party that was in charge of this country called Rhodesia."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"Right, that was one of the most brutal apartheid systems in history."
01:16:59;01:17:06;"Absolutely. They won, they took over. Bob goes over to play a show in 1980 to celebrate the liberation of this country."
01:17:06;01:17:06;"Right."
01:17:06;01:17:10;"It's renamed Zimbabwe and then it's all good."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"But then Robert Mugabe takes over 1980 and he's still in power 35 years later."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"And it's widely seen as one of like the most terrible dictators in the world. He's like 92."
01:17:18;01:17:22;"I'm glad you picked this song because I don't even want to talk about the guy too much."
01:17:22;01:17:26;"But one of these nutty right-wing murderers that we've unfortunately had in the past couple years,"
01:17:26;01:17:29;"there's this picture of him after committing an atrocity."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"There's a picture of him wearing a jacket with the flag of Rhodesia."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Hmm."
01:17:33;01:17:39;"So this idea of that this apartheid country is still like powerful for white supremacists."
01:17:39;01:17:42;"So, you know, even in 2015, sadly."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"That's crazy."
01:17:43;01:17:47;"The idea of a song about Zimbabwe is still very powerful. So let's listen to it. Bob Marley, Zimbabwe."
01:17:56;01:18:04;"Every man got a right to decide his own destiny"
01:18:04;01:18:12;"And in this judgment there is no partiality"
01:18:12;01:18:20;"So arm in arms, with arms, we'll fight this little struggle"
01:18:20;01:18:26;"'Cause that's the only way we can overcome a little trouble"
01:18:26;01:18:34;"Brother you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're so right"
01:18:34;01:18:43;"We gonna fight, we'll have to fight, we gonna fight, fight for our rights"
01:18:43;01:18:50;"Trade it in a Zimbabwe, fit it up in a Zimbabwe"
01:18:50;01:18:58;"Mash it up in a Zimbabwe, Africans are liberated Zimbabwe"
01:18:58;01:19:06;"No more internal power struggle"
01:19:06;01:19:14;"We come together to overcome the little trouble"
01:19:14;01:19:21;"Soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary"
01:19:21;01:19:27;"'Cause I don't want my people to be contrary"
01:19:27;01:19:35;"Brother you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're so right"
01:19:35;01:19:44;"We'll have to fight, we'll have to fight, we'll have to fight, fight for our rights"
01:19:44;01:19:51;"Mash it up in a Zimbabwe, fit it up in a Zimbabwe"
01:19:51;01:19:58;"Africans are liberated Zimbabwe, Ayanaya liberates Zimbabwe"
01:19:58;01:20:05;"Brother you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're so right"
01:20:05;01:20:14;"We gonna fight, we'll have to fight, we gonna fight, fight for our rights"
01:20:14;01:20:22;"To divide and rule could only tear us apart"
01:20:22;01:20:30;"In every man's chest there beats a heart"
01:20:30;01:20:37;"So soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary"
01:20:37;01:20:44;"And I don't want my people to be tricked by mercenaries"
01:20:44;01:20:51;"Brother you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're so right"
01:20:51;01:21:00;"We'll have to fight, we'll have to fight, we'll have to fight, fight for our rights"
01:21:00;01:21:11;"Mash it up in a Zimbabwe, fit it up in a Zimbabwe"
01:21:11;01:21:19;"Africans are liberated Zimbabwe, Africans are liberated Zimbabwe"
01:21:19;01:21:23;"Nati do beat in a Zimbabwe"
01:21:23;01:21:29;"So that's Bob Marley with Zimbabwe. Thank you Jake, I like hearing those two very different political songs from 1979."
01:21:29;01:21:35;"Sometimes it feels like there's less political music today than there was in the past. I don't know."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Yeah, I don't know if it's the case."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"It's hard to say, but the first thing that came to mind when you're talking about this is"
01:21:40;01:21:46;"there is a great political song released by somebody we all know, Dev Hines, aka Blood Orange,"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"called Sandra's Smile. The Sandra referring to Sandra Bland,"
01:21:49;01:21:55;"somebody who is at the very least horribly mistreated by police in Texas and who knows what else."
01:21:55;01:22:03;"And he wrote a song and he's referencing specific events. It's powerful, it's moving, and it's a great song too."
01:22:03;01:22:07;"Because that's the weird thing with political music, somebody can have a really good political intention,"
01:22:07;01:22:13;"but if the song's whack, it weirdly does a disservice, but Dev doesn't make whack songs, so let's listen to it."
01:22:13;01:22:16;"Here's Blood Orange with Sandra's Smile."
01:22:26;01:22:31;"Who taught you to breathe?"
01:22:31;01:22:37;"Then took away your speech"
01:22:37;01:22:42;"Made you feel so loved"
01:22:42;01:22:47;"Then shook your hand with gloves"
01:22:47;01:22:52;"You watched her pass away"
01:22:52;01:22:58;"The words she said were fake"
01:22:58;01:23:03;"Closed our eyes for a while"
01:23:03;01:23:09;"I still see Sandra's smile"
01:23:09;01:23:14;"Can you see it in my face?"
01:23:14;01:23:19;"I've been mother for today"
01:23:19;01:23:25;"Hump for me to stay in place"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"As I force myself away"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"Took an hour ago"
01:23:35;01:23:41;"I read Sabrina's quote"
01:23:41;01:23:46;"Why should she forgive"
01:23:46;01:23:52;"To refuse you if we don't?"
01:23:52;01:23:57;"Can you see it in my face?"
01:23:57;01:24:02;"I've been mother for today"
01:24:02;01:24:07;"Hump for me to stay in place"
01:24:07;01:24:12;"As I force myself away"
01:24:39;01:24:44;"Can you see it in my face?"
01:24:44;01:24:49;"I've been mother for today"
01:24:49;01:24:55;"Hump for me to stay in place"
01:24:55;01:25:00;"As I force myself away"
01:25:00;01:25:06;"Can you feel it in my face?"
01:25:06;01:25:11;"I've been mother for today"
01:25:11;01:25:16;"Hump for me to stay in place"
01:25:16;01:25:21;"As I force myself away"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"That was Blood Orange with Sandra's Smile."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Very powerful song, great song."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"Amazing video, amazing artist."
01:25:27;01:25:31;"Dev is a friend, we've been meaning to have him on the show for a minute."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"We've been trying to have him on the show for a minute."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"But we wanted to hear from him a little bit."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"So we reached out to him just to get a little statement."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"So you guys can hear the person who made that song talk about it a little bit."
01:25:42;01:25:46;"So here's Dev talking about what inspired him to write this song, Sandra's Smile."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"Hey Ezra, thanks for playing the song."
01:25:49;01:25:57;"Sandra's Smile was a song that came about via my reactions to the Sandra Bland case."
01:25:57;01:26:05;"The woman, Texas, who was arrested for changing lanes illegally and was put in prison"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"and then found dead in prison where people didn't know if it was a suicide"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"or if the police had done something to her."
01:26:12;01:26:17;"And my views on that were that even if the police didn't touch her,"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"they still killed her by the way they treated her."
01:26:20;01:26:25;"And so my initial thoughts when the song, when the case happened"
01:26:25;01:26:28;"is that I was devastated of course."
01:26:28;01:26:34;"But it took a couple of days before it really hit me in a really personal place."
01:26:34;01:26:37;"And so I write about that in the song."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"I mean it's called Sandra's Smile because every photo I saw of her not in prison"
01:26:41;01:26:46;"was her smiling, this really huge and wonderful smile."
01:26:46;01:26:53;"I wanted to kind of highlight that, try and highlight this positive memory of her."
01:27:02;01:27:09;"Looking out at the people, looking in"
01:27:09;01:27:16;"Feeling good must be some kind of sin"
01:27:16;01:27:22;"Looking in at the people, looking out"
01:27:22;01:27:29;"Feeling guilty, scared to move about"
01:27:29;01:27:35;"Looking up at the people, looking down"
01:27:35;01:27:42;"Taking tranquilizers by the pound"
01:27:42;01:27:49;"Looking down at the people, looking up"
01:27:49;01:27:56;"Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough"
01:27:56;01:28:04;"But you know that green grass on the other side"
01:28:04;01:28:09;"Just an illusion"
01:28:09;01:28:22;"We all have our own confusion"
01:28:22;01:28:28;"Rich people watching the people poor"
01:28:28;01:28:35;"Trying to figure out how you get some more"
01:28:35;01:28:42;"Poor people watching the people rich"
01:28:42;01:28:48;"You know they call them dirty, you know which"
01:28:48;01:28:55;"Ugly people watching the people pretty"
01:28:55;01:29:02;"Said they can't get down to the nitty gritty"
01:29:02;01:29:08;"Pretty people watching the people ugly"
01:29:08;01:29:15;"Said it sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me"
01:29:15;01:29:24;"But you know that green grass on the other side"
01:29:24;01:29:29;"Just an illusion"
01:29:29;01:29:35;"We all have our own confusion"
01:29:35;01:29:40;"We all have our own confusion"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"That was Bill Withers with Green Grass."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"We really covered a lot of ground so far on the show today,"
01:29:53;01:29:57;"from political music to Seinfeld 2000, horribly tricking me."
01:29:57;01:30:02;"I think it's time for a little time crisis tradition."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Jake, you've done this before, but Joe, you haven't."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"No."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"This is a very important part of the show,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"where we count down the top five songs on iTunes,"
01:30:09;01:30:14;"but sometimes we like to mix it up and get a little wild with it."
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Okay."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"So get ready."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Great."
01:30:17;01:30:24;"It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"It's time for the Top Five."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"This week we're doing something different."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Sometimes we like to challenge ourselves."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"So we're going to take the top five songs of this week"
01:30:31;01:30:35;"and compare them with the top five songs of the same week in 2005."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Okay."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"We'll see what kind of difference ten years makes."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"So if you guys want to hop in our little time machine,"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"we're going to go back to 2005."
01:30:44;01:30:49;"This was the number five song this week in 2005."
01:30:49;01:30:50;"It's an artist I know."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Joe likes Young Jeezy, Full Survivor."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Oh, my God."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"Featuring Akon."
01:30:56;01:31:00;"Akon kind of ruled this couple year period."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Okay."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Young Jeezy and Akon, Full Survivor."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"It's nice to hear Akon's voice again."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"Yeah."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"One of the greats."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"Truly."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Amazing voice."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"I always think of his first single, ""Locked Up,"""
01:31:51;01:31:52;"always pops into my head."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"Song rules."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"It's really burned into my brain."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"And that video rules."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"The ""Locked Up"" video?"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Yeah."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"I remember."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"He crushed it for like a good four or five years."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"He was amazing."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"He was the guy."
01:32:03;01:32:08;"Every few years there was like a guy that kind of sings hooks for rap songs."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Right."
01:32:09;01:32:10;"And he killed it."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"That's a good song."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"And he was a polygamist."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Really?"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"Yeah."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"Many Wives?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Mm-hmm."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"Okay."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Yeah."
01:32:18;01:32:19;"He was like Mormon?"
01:32:19;01:32:20;"He was very--"
01:32:20;01:32:21;"Akon's Mormon."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"He's Mitt Romney's cousin."
01:32:22;01:32:23;"Yeah."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"No, he had like no shame in his game about that."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"He was like, ""Yeah, of course."""
01:32:26;01:32:28;"As long as everybody's on the same page."
01:32:28;01:32:31;"The thing that I can't stand is when you got a second family,"
01:32:31;01:32:32;"but you keep it a secret."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"I got no respect for that."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"No, I mean, that's not okay."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"You got to tell both families about each other."
01:32:36;01:32:39;"I got no respect for the hidden second family."
01:32:39;01:32:43;"Also, by the way, as I was talking, I was like, ""This probably isn't true."""
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Oh, he's a polygamist?"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"Yeah, he might not be a polygamist."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"It sounded like it."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I thought I heard that, but I don't--"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Don't believe everything you hear on the radio."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"We'll check it later."
01:32:53;01:32:58;"So the corresponding song in 2005 is a song we've heard quite a bit."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"This is Drake with ""Hotline Bling."""
01:33:28;01:33:35;"Ever since I left the city, you got a reputation for yourself now"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Everybody knows and I feel left out"
01:33:38;01:33:42;"Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out"
01:33:42;01:33:49;"'Cause ever since I left the city, you started wearing less and going out more"
01:33:49;01:33:53;"Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"Hanging with some girls I never seen before"
01:33:56;01:34:00;"You used to call me on my cell phone"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"Late night when you need my love"
01:34:04;01:34:07;"Call me on my cell phone"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Late night when you need my love"
01:34:10;01:34:11;"That was Drake with ""Hotline Bling."""
01:34:11;01:34:15;"Okay, Young Jeezy, ""Soul Survivor"" versus Drake, ""Hotline Bling."""
01:34:15;01:34:18;"Joe, you're a big rap fan. What do you think?"
01:34:18;01:34:22;"I would say ""Hotline Bling."" I prefer that song."
01:34:22;01:34:27;"""Soul Survivor"" isn't one of the top 10 Jeezy songs to me, personally."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"It's a good song, but Jeezy has a great catalog."
01:34:30;01:34:35;"Whereas ""Hotline Bling,"" for me, top five Drake song."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"It's a powerful Drake song. What about you, Jake?"
01:34:37;01:34:38;"Toss-up."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Really?"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"Yeah, ""Dead Tie."""
01:34:40;01:34:41;"""Dead Tie."""
01:34:41;01:34:42;"I like both those songs."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"Okay. You like both of them."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"I haven't heard that Akon in a long time."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"It sounds good. It sounds a little dated. I mean, it's 10 years old."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"I'm sure that Drake will too in 10."
01:34:50;01:34:54;"We'll see about that. I'll see you in 10 years, my friend."
01:34:54;01:34:58;"Let's go back to 2005. The number four song that week from their album,"
01:34:58;01:35:01;"""All the Right Reasons,"" here's Nickelback with ""Photograph."""
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Yeah. Do you guys remember this song?"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Deep Blue."
01:35:05;01:35:09;"I love that voice. He thinks so hard."
01:35:09;01:35:12;"He's constipated."
01:35:12;01:35:17;"And even 10 years ago, it was weird to think about someone looking at a photograph."
01:35:17;01:35:20;"Like you have your phone and your iPad or whatever."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"It was before Instagram, but it's still weird."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Yeah."
01:35:23;01:35:33;"Nickelback is like hard country."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Yeah."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"That's why they're so big. It's because a rocker can get down to Nickelback,"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"and so can a country person."
01:35:39;01:35:40;"It's like male Shania."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Yeah."
01:35:45;01:35:48;"That voice is insane."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"They just--he and Avril."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"Blitzville."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"They were a couple?"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"They were married."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"Oh, man."
01:35:55;01:36:00;"♪"
01:36:20;01:36:27;"♪"
01:36:27;01:36:28;"Wow."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Harsh."
01:36:29;01:36:30;"I love it."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"I really do love it."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"That was 2005, 10 years ago."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"That's what was ruling the airwaves."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"They weren't afraid to get emotional."
01:36:38;01:36:40;"Okay, I don't know this song."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"The number four song this week is Chris Stapleton with ""Tennessee Whiskey."""
01:36:43;01:36:44;"What?"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"I don't know Chris Stapleton, and I don't know the song ""Tennessee Whiskey."""
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Is that his name?"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"You keep saying it."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"It's weird."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Chris Stapleton."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"Oh, Stapleton."
01:36:51;01:36:52;"And the song is called ""Tennessee Whiskey."""
01:36:52;01:36:56;"If I had to guess what genre it is, I would guess country."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"I'm guessing country."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"But you know what?"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"Maybe that's biased."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"We're being judgmental."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"We're being very judgmental."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"Have any of you guys heard of Chris Stapleton?"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"No."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"I've heard of Chris Stapleton."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"I don't know who the Stapleton guy is."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Chris Stapleton with ""Tennessee Whiskey."""
01:37:09;01:37:11;"It's got to be country."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"It's got to be--"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"The name and then the name of the song."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"You know what?"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"If this song's not--"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"I hope it's hard classical."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"It could be hard classical."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"It could be--"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Just instrumental harp music."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"It could be Gregorian house."
01:37:22;01:37:23;"It could be trap music."
01:37:23;01:37:27;"I'm going to feel like a real stupid New York liberal"
01:37:27;01:37:30;"if I made a judgment about a song called ""Tennessee Whiskey"""
01:37:30;01:37:34;"by Chris Stapleton and it turns out to be hard classical."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"I'll feel like a real jerk."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"Let's give it a listen."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"I think you're good."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"There we go."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"You're good."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"Wait, wait."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"Hold on."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"Ooh, this is like a throwback."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"This is dope."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Chris, we knew you were going to be country,"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"but we didn't know if you'd be dope or not,"
01:37:51;01:37:55;"and so far you're dope, and we salute you for that."
01:37:55;01:37:59;"I haven't heard your vocals yet, though."
01:37:59;01:38:03;"Used to spend my nights out in the bar room."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Pretty country."
01:38:04;01:38:08;"Yeah."
01:38:08;01:38:12;"liquor was the only love I'd known."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"Oh, this is like some Joe Cocker--"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"Yeah, like a Van Morrison--"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Yeah, I can get behind this."
01:38:18;01:38:24;"But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom"
01:38:24;01:38:30;"and brought me back, being too far gone."
01:38:30;01:38:40;"Your last move is Tennessee whiskey."
01:38:43;01:38:51;"You're a scream, strawberry wine."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Oh, strawberry wine."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I was with you until strawberry wine."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"Actually, what do I know about strawberry wine?"
01:38:56;01:38:59;"Okay, I think Nickelback versus Chris Stapleston."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"We have a clear winner."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Yeah, Nickelback."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Oh, oh, okay."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"For sure."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"You surprised me there."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"I like--they're both basically a type of country in a way."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"It's weird how that lined up."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Yeah, we went from two hip-hop songs"
01:39:11;01:39:14;"to two country songs."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"That was cool."
01:39:15;01:39:16;"It's like a throwback."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"It's a little old-timey."
01:39:17;01:39:21;"Yeah, it was a little too sort of self-consciously retro."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"It was pretty retro."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"I mean--"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"But, man, I love country music."
01:39:24;01:39:25;"I love all country music."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Oh, absolutely."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"We should do a country show."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Next show, let's go all country."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"I'm back, man."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"Are you a country guy?"
01:39:31;01:39:32;"Yeah."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Well, okay, next--"
01:39:33;01:39:34;"You remember there used to be a time"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"when people didn't like country?"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"It's crazy to me."
01:39:36;01:39:37;"I mean, I like a specific kind."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"I like outlaw country."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"Okay."
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Bad boys."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"Yeah, bad boys."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"But, like, I still--it's crazy."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"To just blanket statement I don't like country music is absurd."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"I'm with it."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"Chris Stapleton, you have my vote."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Now let's go back to 2005."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"The number three song this week in 2005"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"from the album Monkey Business--"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"I love that phrase, ""Monkey Business."""
01:39:58;01:39:59;"It's so evocative."

01:40:04;01:40:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"This was a big song."

01:40:07;01:40:09;"I was in college when this came out."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"Good."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:40:15;01:40:16;"This still sounds good."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"What you gonna do with all that junk?"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"All that junk inside your trunk?"

01:40:50;01:40:52;"When she says, ""They buy me all these Ices,"""

01:47:07;01:47:08;"He's got chops."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"I mean, I feel like there's 10,000 guys just like him."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"No?"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"Am I wrong?"
01:47:13;01:47:17;"Well, even if there were 10,000 Justin Biebers, only one, because this is how our society works,"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"only one of them won that spot."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"And we need to respect him because of it."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"No, we don't."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"This is, I mean, this is the argument."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"I mean, you know, that's not interesting to me."
01:47:26;01:47:29;"Well, we live in a winner-takes-all society, and Justin Bieber's a winner."

01:47:38;01:47:41;"So that was a Chris Brown, Justin Bieber face-off."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"Oh, boy."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"There's no winner here."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"I guess Bieber."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"I mean, the funny thing is I think I'd go Bieber."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"You have to."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Because, like, the production."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"You have to."

01:51:40;01:51:45;"Again, I mean, to me, it's like a melodramatic ballad."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"It's okay."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"There's a lot of people that sing."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"-I don't know. It just doesn't do anything for me."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"-Joe? -I don't see why she's bulletproof, Joe."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"-I'm not gonna say anything bad about Adele."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"I don't need her Adele fans attacking me."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"-I don't think there's nothing bad to say."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"I love Adele."
01:52:00;01:52:01;"-She does everything right,"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"where, like, she names her albums"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"after, like, how old she is,"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"and so you, like, track her progression"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"as not only a musician but as, like, a human."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"-Can you believe nobody did that before?"
01:52:11;01:52:12;"-It's crazy. It's so smart."
01:52:12;01:52:15;"It's like 7 Up. -So how old is she now?"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"-Well, she's 27."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"That's a point that I've been trying to make on this show,"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"is that a lot of people think that Adele"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"is the age of the album, but it's the --"
01:52:23;01:52:27;"She calls the album the number, the age that she was"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"when she first cooked up a beat for the album."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"-Right. -So she was 25"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"when she started working on this."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"-Two-year process. -Yeah."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"-First of all, Jake, you don't like the trappings"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"of this Adele song, ""Hello,"""
01:52:36;01:52:39;"but imagine if it was, like, a hair metal ballad."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"-Row, row. -Not good."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"-Hell from the other side."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"Row, row, row, row, row."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Can you live in by the night?"
01:52:47;01:52:48;"Wee-wee-wee-wee. -Honestly, yeah, man."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"It sounds like a Nickelback song."
01:52:50;01:52:54;"-Hello from the other side. -Yes, I could get down to that."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"-To see you by the night."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"-Oh, that's the best. -Whew."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"-See, all music's the same. -All music's the same."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"-And we're all the same."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"Okay, I have a feeling who's gonna win on this panel."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"Kanye West, Gold Digger versus Adele, ""Hello."""
01:53:07;01:53:09;"-I say Kanye. -Obviously."
01:53:09;01:53:13;"-Well, so all in all, was 2005 better than 2015?"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"'Cause 2005 has the Kanye and the Jeezy,"
01:53:16;01:53:17;"but it also has the Nickelback, which..."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"-That's rough. -Yeah."
01:53:19;01:53:22;"-I love it. I'm down."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I think I'm pro 2005. -You're 2005, yeah?"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"-Yeah. Living in the past."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"-Yeah, come on, man. That's just sad."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"2015, I don't know."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Well, guys, that was a great top-five session."
01:53:33;01:53:34;"Thanks for joining me."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"I hope everybody at home followed along."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"And Jordan Smith, check him out."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"-And Chris Staples. -Young Cat."
01:53:40;01:53:43;"And Chris Staples said, ""Tennessee whiskey."""
01:53:43;01:53:50;"That was the top 5."
