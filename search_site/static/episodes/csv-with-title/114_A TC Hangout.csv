00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis in a Time of Crisis."
00:04;00:08;"In a FaceTime of Crisis."
00:08;00:14;"We reunite with the crew and some very special guests to talk about everything from Starbucking"
00:14;00:17;"to COVID-19."
00:17;00:22;"But of course, even in these troubled times, we take a moment to dive into the tasteful"
00:22;00:26;"palette of the 1970s and some of that old wisdom."
00:26;00:28;"This is a Weekly."
00:28;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;"B-B-B-Beast."
00:34;00:36;"One."
00:36;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:20;"Leave the lonely man."
01:20;01:24;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:24;01:29;"So this is now our third Time of Crisis, Time Crisis."
01:29;01:32;"Meaning three weeks of lockdown."
01:32;01:37;"Can you believe that the first time we did it, we were actually thinking about getting in the studio."
01:37;01:38;"Right."
01:38;01:39;"You had a slight fever."
01:39;01:44;"Yeah, I had a slight fever for a few days and just wasn't feeling so hot."
01:44;01:45;"What came of that?"
01:45;01:47;"It passed, it subsided."
01:47;01:48;"It has subsided!"
01:48;01:56;"It felt a little bit crazy at the time to make that call two weeks ago to say, ""Hey, I think we should FaceTime."""
01:56;02:01;"But that was like right, I think that was like a Wednesday or a Thursday that we were taping that week."
02:01;02:05;"And it was like right on the day when things really started to change."
02:05;02:14;"Yeah, I remember, it might have been earlier in the week, but I remember the last time I even considered like doing something."
02:14;02:20;"She's come up a lot on this show, Kelly Reichardt, my friend asked me if I want to go see her new movie, First Cow."
02:20;02:24;"And whatever it was, it was like early in that week."
02:24;02:29;"It must have been before I went to Florida for that festival, but or maybe I just gotten back actually."
02:29;02:33;"Either way, it was right on the cusp of being like, well, a movie theater."
02:33;02:38;"It's not a very crowded place for like a daytime showing of something."
02:38;02:41;"Although for all I know, you know, LA is an industry town."
02:41;02:44;"Maybe the 1 p.m. show of the First Cow were jammed."
02:44;02:45;"But I was like, yeah, maybe."
02:45;02:48;"And it's also that funny feeling when someone suggests something to you."
02:48;02:52;"I often assume that people are like more rational than me."
02:52;02:54;"So, you know, somebody else is like, ""Oh, yeah, let's go see a movie."""
02:54;02:57;"You're like, ""Oh, okay, people are still seeing movies. Cool."""
02:57;02:59;"But then at some point I was like, ""Yeah, I think I planted the seed of doubt."""
02:59;03:01;"I was like, ""Yeah, you're right. It won't be crowded."
03:01;03:03;"And if it's really crowded, we could dip."""
03:03;03:06;"And they're like, ""Oh, really? You think things are going to get that weird?"""
03:06;03:07;"And I was like, ""I don't know."""
03:07;03:09;"And then I was like, ""We could just take a hike."""
03:09;03:10;"And then we took a hike instead."
03:10;03:13;"And that was the last time I did something."
03:13;03:15;"That must have been like two and a half weeks ago now."
03:15;03:16;"Yeah."
03:16;03:24;"I bailed on my sister-in-law's birthday the night before we did the first FaceTime crisis."
03:24;03:27;"And I felt bad about that at the time. It seemed extreme."
03:27;03:30;"But looking back, it was like, ""Okay, that was the right thing to do."""
03:30;03:35;"That brings us up to now, the third time of crisis, time crisis."
03:35;03:39;"Things have been locked down, Jake. Have you been back to Home Depot lately?"
03:39;03:43;"I've been zooming by. I should do another drive-by tomorrow. Check it out."
03:43;03:48;"I was talking to a friend today who went to Home Depot this evening."
03:48;03:49;"Yeah?"
03:49;03:58;"And they've basically taped off the area so when you're in line, you're basically in your quarantine zone."
03:58;04:02;"So you can't step over the tape to keep people six feet apart."
04:02;04:03;"All right. Good."
04:03;04:07;"Is that in line to get into the building or is that cashing out?"
04:07;04:10;"I can't imagine they've got a line out to build it yet."
04:10;04:16;"But maybe they do. But it's certainly cashing out that you have your quarantine zone."
04:16;04:21;"We've seen these images from around the country. I'm sure you guys have seen some of them."
04:21;04:28;"There's one I saw on Twitter of delivery people all jammed outside of this restaurant, Carbone, in New York,"
04:28;04:33;"which is a great restaurant. It's expensive. It's a bougie restaurant."
04:33;04:37;"They famously have a $70 veal parm."
04:37;04:41;"Have we ever talked about the $70 veal parm on the show?"
04:41;04:44;"Is that a favorite of Ariana Grande's?"
04:44;04:47;"Yeah, I know we've talked about veal parm."
04:47;04:53;"It's the type of place that you're often taken out to eat at in the showbiz."
04:53;04:57;"People are like, ""Oh, it's at Carbone."" It's a fun Italian restaurant."
04:57;05:03;"But the veal parm, I've seen it. It's this giant piece of veal. It's very large."
05:03;05:07;"I think there's something about veal already rubs people the wrong way."
05:07;05:13;"I'm surprised it's served in a fancy, bougie restaurant where people have a pretty liberal sensibility."
05:13;05:18;"I don't think the anti-veal lobby really made all that much of a dent."
05:18;05:21;"Definitely a lot of places have banned foie gras."
05:21;05:29;"I think because there was a lot of emphasis put on the fact that to get this pate thing, they have to really force-feed a goose."
05:29;05:33;"So then you're picturing something being tortured."
05:33;05:38;"I imagine for the average meat-eater, when they think about veal,"
05:38;05:41;"somebody's saying, ""They're killing a baby cow."""
05:41;05:44;"I bet maybe the average person is like, ""Yeah, alright."""
05:44;05:48;"Maybe that's better than raising a cow to die later. Who knows?"
05:48;05:54;"I'm not condoning it. You know that I have strong sympathies with the vegans and the animal rights activists."
05:54;05:58;"I think it's also that the baby cow is kept in a confined space."
05:58;06:01;"Is that part of veal? That the cow can't have a good life?"
06:01;06:03;"Something to do with the muscles. You want to keep the muscles tender."
06:03;06:08;"This is a gross conversation, but we're giving that baby a great life."
06:08;06:16;"We made sure that the baby cow had an extra bad life to make sure that your $70 veal parm is extra tender."
06:16;06:26;"I've taken a walk to an African park one day"
06:26;06:37;"I saw a sign say the animals have the right of way"
06:37;06:48;"Wildlife, whatever happened to"
06:48;06:57;"Wildlife, the animals in the zoo"
06:57;07:05;"Clearly, this is an image of a bunch of underpaid, although hopefully not underpaid,"
07:05;07:10;"anybody who can afford it, if you're ordering anything from the outside world these days,"
07:10;07:14;"you've got to be cranking that tip up to minimum 25%."
07:14;07:18;"I think 20%, a lot of people say, ""Well, that's what you do at a restaurant."""
07:18;07:24;"But I feel like with delivery stuff, what's the lowest option they give you on those apps? Usually 10%?"
07:24;07:27;"Which is kind of insulting. It's like, why? Come on."
07:27;07:34;"That'd be maybe a cool move on the part of what are these places called? Uber Eats, Postmates, Grubhub,"
07:34;07:35;"Caviar,"
07:35;07:36;"Chow Now,"
07:36;07:37;"DoorDash."
07:37;07:41;"If you can afford to order in, you can afford to give a big fat tip."
07:41;07:45;"So anyway, picture this. This image that people are seeing."
07:45;07:49;"A fancy restaurant in New York City, already known as the city of the house and the have-nots."
07:49;07:56;"A bunch of people jammed together, no rhyme or reason, no six-foot organizational thing happening."
07:56;08:06;"Just a bunch of delivery people jammed outside, waiting to pick up piping hot $70 veal parms."
08:06;08:07;"So gnarly."
08:07;08:13;"Which now I'm learning they specifically gave the baby cow a bad life to make it taste good."
08:13;08:14;"I got to look this up."
08:14;08:17;"So anyway, people are looking at this image like, ""Good Lord."""
08:17;08:23;"And the first thing in my head, I was just thinking, ""God, can't somebody... I know it's tough for restaurants."
08:23;08:29;"Can't they hire somebody who... one of their employees that they probably are about to lay off and just be like,"
08:29;08:36;"'We'll give you a serious mask and a hazmat suit and you can just be in charge of crowd control outside for everybody's safety.'"""
08:36;08:37;"Yeah."
08:37;08:42;"Everybody, six feet apart. I got four veal parms going out to Jake Longstreth."
08:42;08:45;"If that's you, come get it. Everybody else, keep your distance."
08:45;08:51;"Yeah, I'm just scanning the veal Wikipedia page, which is a kind of a bleak document, as you might imagine."
08:51;08:53;"But yeah, they're housed in pens."
08:53;08:56;"Because the better the life, the worse the veal?"
08:56;08:57;"Apparently."
08:57;09:03;"This is something that a lot of people believe this about art as well."
09:03;09:07;"The artist needs a very sh*tty life to produce the truly delicious, tender art."
09:07;09:09;"You have to suffer."
09:10;09:19;"You know, I saw on the New York Times today that Guitar Center is keeping some of their stores open, which is an essential service."
09:19;09:20;"Interesting."
09:20;09:25;"And people were going in and trying out guitars and then hanging them back up on the wall."
09:25;09:28;"And it just seemed like a recipe for disaster."
09:28;09:34;"I mean, I can see why they still... maybe people are still ordering music equipment."
09:34;09:39;"I can imagine that for some people who aren't living too close to the bone and just worrying about their next meal,"
09:39;09:47;"maybe there's a few weekend warrior, kind of like lawyer type dads, accountants, kind of white collar people,"
09:47;09:51;"who are just like, ""You know what? Working at home isn't half bad."""
09:51;09:59;"Just like going through documents and being like, ""You know, now that I'm not commuting, I wouldn't mind maybe getting back into some guitar."
09:59;10:02;"I've been meaning to... I mean, it's crossed my mind."
10:02;10:07;"I kind of want to get some more equipment at the crib while I'm here all the time."""
10:07;10:10;"Is your stuff in storage somewhere?"
10:10;10:12;"You know, I got a little setup at home."
10:12;10:16;"You know, all of our touring gear is... I don't even know."
10:16;10:21;"Actually, all our touring gear for all I know might be in Argentina right now because that's where we were about to be."
10:21;10:22;"Whoa."
10:22;10:28;"I actually got an alert on my phone today that said, ""Get ready for your flight to Buenos Aires."""
10:28;10:30;"I was like, ""That's not happening."""
10:30;10:34;"Yeah, because they moved Lollapalooza to South America later in the year."
10:34;10:42;"I can imagine why people want to still order musical equipment for sure, but yet to have the actual store open, that's kind of strange."
10:42;10:43;"Yeah."
10:43;10:45;"Well, Jake, how's your mental state?"
10:45;10:47;"It's pretty good."
10:47;10:49;"We have a nice rhythm going at the house now."
10:49;10:52;"Can't really complain in terms of how things are going."
10:52;10:58;"I got to say, for me, I'm not stir-crazy, which I guess I wouldn't have guessed I would be."
10:58;11:00;"I don't usually go stir-crazy."
11:00;11:06;"I've lived in some real small rooms in my life from college and after college."
11:06;11:08;"I've always been like, ""I'm happy to chill for a while."""
11:08;11:13;"Yeah, so I don't find the stress of being in one place to be unbearable."
11:13;11:19;"Although, I also got to extend sympathy to anybody who's just riding this one out solo."
11:19;11:21;"That, I'm sure, is a different feeling."
11:21;11:25;"If you're not with friends or family or loved ones, that's going to be a different feeling."
11:25;11:30;"But yeah, the idea of just not leaving the house, I feel like if you told me I couldn't leave the house for a year,"
11:30;11:33;"I'd be like, ""All right, I'm down with that."""
11:33;11:36;"What about you, Jake? If you're under house arrest?"
11:36;11:38;"True house arrest? You can't leave the house."
11:38;11:39;"Yeah."
11:39;11:40;"I can't go for a run, for instance."
11:40;11:49;"I usually go for a run almost every day, which is nice because I get out, get some air, look at some trees, look at the light."
11:49;11:52;"Okay, you can go in the backyard. You can be out in the air."
11:52;11:54;"You just can't leave the premises."
11:54;11:57;"I mean, I think I could do a year if I had to."
11:57;12:01;"If I was literally under house arrest and it was like, ""You have no choice in the matter,"""
12:01;12:05;"I think I could find my inner strength and composure to keep it together."
12:05;12:10;"Even if somebody said I couldn't leave the house for three years, especially with the internet and stuff, I'd really be—"
12:10;12:12;"I think I could hold it down."
12:12;12:15;"I don't know about the economics of it, but just mentally?"
12:15;12:18;"That would take some fortitude. Three years."
12:18;12:23;"In this current quarantine situation, and certainly in a three-year situation,"
12:23;12:26;"what are you guys going to do about haircuts?"
12:26;12:32;"You see, when I brought it off air, you seemed not as concerned as I thought you'd be."
12:32;12:34;"What is going to happen?"
12:34;12:36;"I'm not concerned about it at all."
12:36;12:42;"I mean, I always get the most concerned about haircuts when I'm going to go on tour, doing something on TV,"
12:42;12:44;"because I'm like, ""Oh, I don't want to look like a bum."""
12:44;12:46;"I care way less at home."
12:46;12:51;"And then the small aspects of a haircut that really make me feel clean,"
12:51;12:57;"that's just a little bit of a buzz on the back of the neck, a little clean up over the ears."
12:57;13:01;"I was talking to Rashida just today."
13:01;13:04;"She gave herself a little trim. I don't know if she might have been doing her bangs or something."
13:04;13:06;"She was like, ""What are you going to do? You need help?"""
13:06;13:09;"And I was like, ""Yeah, maybe. Maybe just a little bit here and there."""
13:09;13:11;"So I think that'll be sufficient."
13:11;13:12;"What are you guys thinking?"
13:12;13:14;"I think I'm going to let it grow, to quote Mountain Bruce."

14:12;14:13;"- Do you have long hair?"
14:13;14:15;"- I've had long hair a few times, yeah."
14:15;14:16;"- What's the longest, your--"
14:16;14:17;"- Like shoulder length."
14:17;14:20;"- Oh yeah, I can kind of picture you with that long hair."
14:20;14:21;"Yeah."
14:21;14:24;"- Last time I had long hair was like 14 or 15."
14:24;14:26;"Like not that long ago."
14:26;14:28;"- Have you ever had dreadlocks?"
14:28;14:30;"- Hell yeah, man, senior year of high school."
14:30;14:31;"- Nice."
14:31;14:33;"- It was such a sick look."
14:33;14:33;"- No."
14:33;14:34;"- I'm kidding."
14:34;14:37;"(laughing)"
14:37;14:41;"I did have long hair my senior year of high school."
14:41;14:44;"When I see photos of it, it looks so bad."
14:44;14:46;"- I had very long hair towards the end of high school too."
14:46;14:47;"- Really?"
14:47;14:48;"- Is that some kind of like rite of passage?"
14:48;14:51;"- Yeah, you're just like senior year, letting it grow, man."
14:51;14:52;"(laughing)"
14:52;14:56;"It was very long, but my hair used to get,"
14:56;14:58;"maybe it still would if it was long,"
14:58;15:01;"but the longer it got, the more curly it would get."
15:01;15:02;"- Like fro?"
15:02;15:05;"- Not really a fro, but like some pretty like big curls."
15:05;15:06;"- Okay."
15:06;15:08;"- As it would grow, like occasionally,"
15:08;15:11;"just depending on how it dried or the weather,"
15:11;15:13;"I might get like in the front,"
15:13;15:15;"like a big fat like sausage curl,"
15:15;15:18;"almost like a little girl from like the Victorian era"
15:18;15:19;"or something."
15:19;15:20;"- Oh, okay."
15:20;15:21;"- It would just turn out to grow just like,"
15:21;15:24;"I don't know, I think that is something, a sausage curl."
15:24;15:27;"It didn't have that like long and straight look,"
15:27;15:29;"like kind of like metal dude,"
15:29;15:31;"but yeah, that's what I was working with."
15:31;15:34;"And then when I went to college, I still had long hair."
15:34;15:36;"And then at some point I just buzzed it."
15:36;15:40;"- That'd be a tight look for her vampire going forward."
15:40;15:41;"- Long hair again?"
15:41;15:43;"- As the band kind of, you know,"
15:43;15:46;"continues to develop its jam chops."
15:46;15:47;"- Just get a little crunchier."
15:47;15:50;"- You grow the hair out, stocks and socks."
15:50;15:52;"- I mean, I've thought about that,"
15:52;15:54;"is that I don't think as the front man of this band,"
15:54;15:58;"I'm really on brand with my current haircut."
15:58;16:01;"I was thinking that when we saw Pigeons playing ping pong"
16:01;16:02;"after Goose."
16:02;16:03;"- Yeah."
16:03;16:04;"- Although Goose is like pretty clean cut,"
16:04;16:06;"but Pigeons playing ping pong,"
16:06;16:07;"there's multiple people in that band"
16:07;16:10;"with just like serious hair."
16:10;16:10;"- Yeah."
16:10;16:12;"- Real curly, real long."
16:12;16:15;"And honestly, it's a joy to watch on stage."
16:15;16:17;"- Yeah, I don't think that's as much a thing anymore"
16:17;16:19;"with rock bands having the serious hair."
16:19;16:21;"- No, remember what a big deal it was in the nineties"
16:21;16:23;"for Metallica to cut their hair?"
16:23;16:26;"I think it just doesn't mean anything now."
16:26;16:29;"It used to be like this line in the sand."
16:29;16:29;"- Right."
16:29;16:31;"- You're long hair or you're not."
16:31;16:33;"And I just don't think it means anything."
16:33;16:35;"So if there was a band, like a couple of dudes had long hair,"
16:35;16:38;"it just doesn't like read any kind of way."
16:38;16:40;"- No, I remember like in the nineties,"
16:40;16:43;"it'd be like, ooh, that band has short hair, crazy."
16:43;16:45;"- Bunch of short hairs."
16:45;16:46;"- Like, oh, Pavement."
16:46;16:49;"The guys in Pavement have like short hair in like '92."
16:49;16:52;"I was like, whoa, that's cool."
16:52;16:54;"Like that's like an interesting vibe."
16:54;16:57;"- Are you familiar with the Rasta phrase, bald head?"
16:57;16:57;"- No."
16:57;16:59;"- There's a lot of like reggae songs,"
16:59;17:02;"including some Bob Marley that they use the phrase bald head"
17:02;17:04;"to describe like a non-Rasta,"
17:04;17:06;"often referred to in a derogatory way,"
17:06;17:07;"like a crazy bald head."
17:07;17:09;"But I always thought it was funny too,"
17:09;17:12;"because it's like, it's not literally talking about"
17:12;17:13;"like a bald man."
17:13;17:15;"It's kind of like any dude without locks"
17:15;17:17;"is just a (beep) bald head."
17:17;17:19;"Which is a little bit,"
17:19;17:21;"there's something similar in like rock music too."
17:21;17:23;"Or like old school rock metal (beep)"
17:23;17:25;"like you don't have long hair, man."
17:25;17:28;"You might as well have a crew cut, 'cause you're (beep)"
17:28;17:31;"- I mean, you might play guitar like Steve Vai,"
17:31;17:35;"but if you have short hair, not interested."

18:32;18:34;"- Wait, Nick, are you gonna shave your head?"
18:34;18:37;"- I think that this woman that cuts her hair,"
18:37;18:40;"she usually comes to the house and cuts her hair."
18:40;18:44;"She's gonna FaceTime with Amantha, my wife,"
18:44;18:47;"and she's gonna try to sort of coach her"
18:47;18:48;"through cutting my hair."
18:48;18:50;"I don't think it's gonna go very well,"
18:50;18:51;"so I just have to be prepared."
18:51;18:54;"Like I've tried to have Amantha cut my hair forever."
18:54;18:55;"Like I grew up, my mom cut my hair."
18:55;18:57;"Amantha just wants nothing to do with it"
18:57;18:59;"and thinks she's really gonna (beep) it up."
18:59;19:03;"So I have to be prepared if I do that,"
19:03;19:05;"that it may just end with me shaving my head."
19:05;19:08;"- Would it be like full Rogan style?"
19:08;19:10;"- Yeah, I think it would be, I'd go full Rogue."
19:10;19:11;"(laughs)"
19:11;19:13;"- I wanna see this."
19:13;19:14;"- I got a question."
19:14;19:16;"So Nick, you're talking about your wife"
19:16;19:17;"and then your mother used to cut your hair."
19:17;19:19;"My mom used to cut my hair too."
19:19;19:21;"How come hair cutting in the home,"
19:21;19:24;"it's kind of, I guess, traditionally,"
19:24;19:25;"with old school gender roles,"
19:25;19:27;"it's always like mom cuts your hair,"
19:27;19:31;"but then barbershop culture is like always the fellas."
19:31;19:33;"- I have a story about that."
19:33;19:33;"- Yeah."
19:33;19:37;"- Yeah, in my house, it was always my mom cut my hair."
19:37;19:39;"Interesting gender role side thing"
19:39;19:43;"is that my mom exclusively drives"
19:43;19:45;"and my dad doesn't and really never drove us,"
19:45;19:47;"which is again, sort of opposite gender roles."
19:47;19:49;"Like it's always the dad drives the car"
19:49;19:51;"and in my house it was the opposite."
19:51;19:52;"- I think that's like the old school"
19:52;19:55;"kind of like sexist roll call is just like,"
19:55;19:59;"if the father is present, he will drive."
19:59;20:01;"If the father is not present"
20:01;20:03;"and no boys in the family have a license,"
20:03;20:04;"then the mother will drive,"
20:04;20:08;"but only when the father is not present."
20:08;20:11;"- Yeah, but see your dad never drove."
20:11;20:13;"- Wait, why is that?"
20:13;20:15;"- I don't know, it's just sort of how it played out."
20:15;20:17;"- I don't think he's a particularly good driver."
20:17;20:21;"I think in some maybe weird other"
20:21;20:24;"sort of patriarchal gendered thing,"
20:24;20:27;"my dad liked the idea of being driven around,"
20:27;20:29;"even though it's sort of the merit,"
20:29;20:32;"like culturally it would be the man should drive."
20:32;20:35;"I think he just sort of found his own comfort zone"
20:35;20:36;"in being driven around,"
20:36;20:40;"which probably played out in a chauvinistic way."
20:40;20:42;"- Would he always go in the passenger seat?"
20:42;20:44;"- Yeah, he'd always just go in the passenger seat."
20:44;20:46;"- But would he drive himself around?"
20:46;20:48;"- No, no, not really."
20:48;20:49;"- How did he get to work?"
20:49;20:51;"- He would take the bus."
20:51;20:52;"- Whoa."
20:52;20:54;"- But then I will say to the going back"
20:54;20:56;"to the haircut situation,"
20:56;21:01;"I remember being around 13, 12, 13 years old"
21:01;21:03;"and seeing ""Boys in the Hood."""
21:03;21:07;"You know, there's sort of a famous scene where,"
21:07;21:09;"do you remember this scene, they're in the kitchen"
21:09;21:13;"and Lawrence Fishburne's cutting Cuba Gooding Jr.'s hair,"
21:13;21:16;"his son's hair, and he's giving him a fade."
21:16;21:18;"And he's like, yeah, he gives the best fade."
21:18;21:22;"And they have this really great father-son bonding moment."
21:22;21:24;"And I remember going to my dad and saying,"
21:24;21:27;"""Dad, I wanna have a similar father-son bonding moment"
21:27;21:31;"""with you that Cuba Gooding Jr. had in the movie"
21:31;21:32;"""with Lawrence Fishburne."""
21:32;21:34;"And asking my dad to give me a fade."
21:34;21:39;"And not only is my dad has no idea how to cut hair,"
21:39;21:41;"I can't also get a fade."
21:41;21:43;"I just don't really have that hair."
21:43;21:45;"Like it's, we're working with very different hair."
21:45;21:49;"So we went to CVS and my dad bought a razor"
21:49;21:50;"and he tried to give me a fade."
21:50;21:52;"And he basically just gave me sort of a mohawk."
21:52;21:55;"He just sort of accidentally just sort of shaved"
21:55;21:58;"all the way in the back of my head to the front."
21:58;21:59;"And then on the other side,"
21:59;22:02;"I had this really crooked mohawk"
22:02;22:05;"that was just from zero to a hundred on the sides,"
22:05;22:06;"like no fade."
22:06;22:07;"- Yeah."
22:07;22:10;"- And it was right before class pictures."
22:10;22:13;"And my mom was mortified."
22:13;22:14;"- Yeah."
22:14;22:16;"- But we also didn't have the bonding experience either."
22:16;22:19;"There was no, it was really tense."
22:19;22:21;"And my dad didn't know what he was doing."
22:21;22:22;"And he just sort of accidentally--"
22:22;22:23;"- Your mom was like, ""This is why I cut the hair."""
22:23;22:25;"- This is why I cut the hair."
22:25;22:27;"- I'm very impressed by anybody who can cut hair."
22:27;22:29;"And I'm very curious about what's going to go down"
22:29;22:34;"when you do this kind of FaceTime remote haircut training."
22:34;22:37;"The first thing it makes me think of is like in a movie"
22:37;22:41;"when there's like a lay person ends up near a bomb"
22:41;22:45;"and then the bomb squad cop has to call them on the phone."
22:45;22:46;"And they're just like freaking out."
22:46;22:47;"They're just like, ""Listen to me."
22:47;22:50;"Do you see two wires?"""
22:50;22:51;"""Uh, I think so."""
22:51;22:53;"""Okay, is one of them blue?"""
22:53;22:55;"""Uh, yeah, one's blue."""
22:55;22:57;"""Okay, next to that is a yellow one."""
22:57;22:59;"""Okay, now up top."""
22:59;23:01;"You're like, this is like a classic movie."
23:01;23:03;"It's like, because with hair,"
23:03;23:06;"I've always been mystified that hair is,"
23:06;23:09;"on the one hand, it's like, it's kind of like simple, right?"
23:09;23:11;"Like you would think it's not that hard"
23:11;23:13;"to be good at cutting hair."
23:13;23:16;"And yet, as anybody knows,"
23:16;23:19;"the difference between a good skilled person"
23:19;23:21;"and other person, I mean,"
23:21;23:23;"you're talking about your self-esteem for a month."
23:23;23:26;"You're talking about your whole wellbeing,"
23:26;23:27;"your mental health."
23:27;23:29;"It's a very serious job."
23:29;23:31;"And I've always kind of wondered,"
23:31;23:33;"actually, the woman who cuts my hair, she's great."
23:33;23:35;"Shout out to Candice."
23:35;23:40;"And she tells me about how sometimes she'll give classes"
23:40;23:43;"or there's a whole system for training people and stuff."
23:43;23:46;"I wonder even what the language is."
23:46;23:47;"- Yeah."
23:47;23:49;"- Specialized hair cutting terms that we don't know,"
23:49;23:51;"but when they're talking to each other,"
23:51;23:53;"they're just like, ""Now grab the bridle."
23:53;23:55;"Now hold the bridle straight."""
23:55;23:57;"- When you look at the hair from the top"
23:57;23:59;"and you see these weird things,"
23:59;24:02;"is it like when you see one of those posters"
24:02;24:06;"for all the different pieces of meat in a cow"
24:06;24:08;"and you got your hanger steak and your rump roast?"
24:08;24:10;"Is there (beep) like that for hair?"
24:10;24:11;"You have your whorl."
24:11;24:13;"Is that how you say it?"
24:13;24:14;"Whorl?"
24:14;24:15;"You guys know the word I'm talking about?"
24:15;24:16;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
24:16;24:19;"- It's a pattern of spirals or concentric circles."
24:19;24:23;"So everybody, most people have some type of whorl"
24:23;24:25;"in the back of their head."
24:25;24:27;"Like where your hair kind of spirals out."
24:27;24:29;"So I wonder, are there all sorts of like"
24:29;24:32;"weird sacred geometries and (beep) people say?"
24:32;24:34;"'Cause I've had people cut my hair,"
24:34;24:36;"will often say like the back of my neck,"
24:36;24:39;"it's like the hair goes in different directions."
24:39;24:42;"So it's very complex to like make it straight."
24:42;24:44;"And obviously people have cow licks."
24:44;24:47;"We know some of these words like cow lick and whorl,"
24:47;24:52;"but then I, yeah, I wonder if there's like a true map of it."
24:52;24:54;"It almost reminds me of like,"
24:54;24:56;"you know, like in the medieval times"
24:56;24:57;"where there'd be like these guilds"
24:57;25:00;"that had this very specialized knowledge"
25:00;25:04;"about how to make like blue glass and like metal stuff."
25:04;25:05;"I wonder if like with hair. - Steel, yeah."
25:05;25:08;"- Yeah, there's like a whole other language"
25:08;25:10;"and way of looking at hair that, you know,"
25:10;25:12;"like we just see a haircut and we're like,"
25:12;25:13;"""Hey, it looks good on you."""
25:13;25:15;"They look at it and they must be seeing,"
25:15;25:17;"you know, like beautiful mind type (beep)."
25:17;25:19;"- By the way, guys, I gotta go now to go"
25:19;25:21;"have dinner with Amantha for her birthday."
25:21;25:22;"- Say what's up."
25:22;25:23;"- I will."
25:23;25:26;"- I also do think maybe,"
25:26;25:29;"'cause I've never sort of live streamed or IG'd,"
25:29;25:32;"I was like, maybe that would just be a funny thing"
25:32;25:36;"to have, to basically do through my Instagram"
25:36;25:38;"'cause everyone's doing it now to have the woman"
25:38;25:41;"do that through Amantha and then we can film it."
25:41;25:43;"But I do think, I mean, I'll let you guys know"
25:43;25:45;"'cause I think there's a fairly, I don't know,"
25:45;25:49;"it's more than 50/50, 60/40 that it's gonna really go"
25:49;25:52;"sideways and I'm gonna have to shave my head."
25:52;25:55;"That's what I want to have happen."
25:55;25:58;"- Just wear a hat for a couple of years."
25:58;26:00;"- Well, you might see it next week."
26:00;26:00;"- All right."
26:00;26:02;"- I don't think I'm ready for a haircut next week."
26:02;26:03;"I think we're talking in a week,"
26:03;26:06;"but we're in a weekly TC mode,"
26:06;26:08;"so you're gonna certainly see it."
26:08;26:09;"All right, guys, I love you."
26:09;26:10;"I heard how it's going."
26:10;26:12;"Stay safe, talk to you in a bit."
26:12;26:13;"- All right. - All right, peace."
26:13;26:14;"- Peace."

26:47;26:49;"Time Crisis"
26:49;26:50;"on Beats 1."
26:50;26:53;"- So Jake, have you been going to the supermarket?"
26:53;26:57;"- Yeah, we did a big stock up two weeks ago."
26:57;26:59;"And then I've gone,"
26:59;27:01;"there's a little grocery store,"
27:01;27:04;"like a block from my house called Uno Market."
27:04;27:07;"And I've gone there three or four times"
27:07;27:12;"to buy avocados and beer and chips and stuff."
27:12;27:13;"- So what's the vibe?"
27:13;27:15;"You feel comfortable?"
27:15;27:16;"Are you suiting up?"
27:16;27:17;"You throwing a mask on, gloves?"
27:17;27:19;"Are you staying six feet away from people?"
27:19;27:20;"- I'm keeping my distance."
27:20;27:23;"No gloves, no mask."
27:23;27:28;"People there who work there are wearing gloves and masks."
27:28;27:29;"The last time I went,"
27:29;27:32;"it seemed to be a higher level of anxiety there"
27:32;27:34;"than the other times."
27:34;27:36;"- Oh, you feel like it's been ratcheting up?"
27:36;27:38;"- Yeah, I feel like it."
27:38;27:40;"And we've had a few grocery deliveries,"
27:40;27:42;"which, you know, I have to order out"
27:42;27:44;"like three or four days in advance."
27:44;27:46;"We've just been making a lot of food."
27:46;27:48;"- Are you drinking a lot of coffee?"
27:48;27:50;"- Yeah, big time."
27:50;27:50;"- It's an interesting one"
27:50;27:53;"because I find the relationship to coffee,"
27:53;27:54;"I've been thinking about it"
27:54;27:56;"'cause when you're quarantined,"
27:56;27:57;"you've still got stuff to do,"
27:57;28:00;"but you could make the case, you know,"
28:00;28:03;"it's not like you're commuting into town"
28:03;28:05;"and running to meetings and stuff, you know,"
28:05;28:07;"like maybe you need less coffee,"
28:07;28:10;"but also the temptation just to drink coffee all day"
28:10;28:14;"is very strong when you're just posted up in the house."
28:14;28:16;"- What time are you drinking coffee until?"
28:16;28:18;"- I rarely go past 4 p.m."
28:18;28:19;"- Four's late."
28:19;28:21;"- Yeah, maybe it's a little too late."
28:21;28:23;"I haven't been falling asleep as early as I'd like to."
28:23;28:26;"- I'm usually cutting it off around one."
28:26;28:28;"- Yeah, man, I really wonder what it's like out there"
28:28;28:30;"because you see these images, you know,"
28:30;28:33;"I think for people who are working as delivery people,"
28:33;28:35;"working at supermarkets,"
28:35;28:38;"these are really hardcore jobs right now."
28:38;28:38;"- Yeah."
28:38;28:42;"- And you really gotta hope that all these places,"
28:42;28:46;"whether it's these apps or the actual supermarkets"
28:46;28:48;"are treating people correctly."
28:48;28:50;"'Cause yeah, it's funny, like obviously"
28:50;28:53;"this is a huge moment in terms of like a lot of businesses"
28:53;28:55;"simply can't afford to keep their staff on"
28:55;28:56;"and that's why, you know,"
28:56;28:59;"hopefully the government will be helping people out"
28:59;28:59;"who lose their jobs."
28:59;29:03;"But these businesses that actually are booming,"
29:03;29:08;"like supermarkets and, you know, food delivery and stuff,"
29:08;29:09;"you really gotta hope that they're like"
29:09;29:13;"going the extra mile to take care of people."
29:13;29:14;"- They're probably not."
29:14;29:16;"- Yeah, odds are they aren't."
29:16;29:19;"- Major corporations aren't known for that."
29:19;29:20;"What about you, man?"
29:20;29:21;"- Pretty stocked up,"
29:21;29:24;"so I haven't been to a supermarket in a while."
29:24;29:25;"- You guys doing some post?"
29:25;29:28;"- Yeah, I've ordered in here and there."
29:28;29:29;"- Yeah."
29:29;29:30;"- But even then it's like, yeah,"
29:30;29:31;"I have like mixed feelings about it."
29:31;29:33;"Like, I guess on the one hand,"
29:33;29:36;"it's like you're supporting local restaurants"
29:36;29:39;"and, you know, trying to support the delivery people,"
29:39;29:42;"but yeah, it's just like a strange feeling too."
29:42;29:44;"A little bit of stress every time"
29:44;29:45;"you bring something new into the house"
29:45;29:48;"and you really gotta kind of wipe it down and stuff."
29:48;29:50;"But yeah, I'm very curious about,"
29:50;29:52;"I think maybe a lot of people feel this way,"
29:52;29:54;"but it's hard when you're quarantined,"
29:54;29:56;"you're taking a bunch of information,"
29:56;29:56;"you talk to your friends,"
29:56;30:00;"but most people I know are taking it very seriously,"
30:00;30:02;"but I'm just kind of curious what like,"
30:02;30:04;"what it's like out there."
30:04;30:06;"Because, you know, when you're taking it seriously,"
30:06;30:08;"you only get images and anecdotes."
30:08;30:09;"So I'm kind of curious, like,"
30:09;30:11;"are there still parts of the country"
30:11;30:13;"that are like fully business as usual?"
30:13;30:15;"- I think, I mean, you saw those images"
30:15;30:18;"on like Florida beaches and down South."
30:18;30:20;"- Right, just jam-packed guitar centers."
30:20;30:23;"And then I'm also just kind of curious"
30:23;30:28;"what it's like for people who are still going to work"
30:28;30:30;"and just kind of what that looks like."
30:30;30:33;"And anyway, it was interesting for me"
30:33;30:37;"following friend of the show, Winter, on Twitter,"
30:37;30:40;"because he was kind of like out there."
30:40;30:41;"I think he's home now"
30:41;30:43;"and we're going to get him on the phone shortly,"
30:43;30:46;"but following Winter on Twitter,"
30:46;30:48;"you know, most people I follow on Twitter are like,"
30:48;30:51;"you know, journalists and people who are probably"
30:51;30:55;"locked down in their apartments fairly early on."
30:55;30:56;"And then Winter was the one person"
30:56;30:59;"who I felt was like giving me a small window"
30:59;31:01;"through the lens of Starbucks-ing"
31:01;31:06;"into just like the country slowly closing down."
31:06;31:09;"So Winter was like out there on some kind of journey"
31:09;31:11;"and he was kind of reporting like,"
31:11;31:14;"well, you know, the Starbucks is like totally open."
31:14;31:16;"Then he's like gets to one where like the manager's"
31:16;31:19;"like new policy, you know, things are changing."
31:19;31:21;"And then suddenly some of them are closed."
31:21;31:24;"And so it kind of almost felt like Winter was out there"
31:24;31:27;"on the road Starbucks-ing just as this started to happen."
31:27;31:31;"So I feel like in real time, his Starbucks-ing journey,"
31:31;31:33;"he was kind of just pinballing"
31:33;31:37;"through this maze of COVID America."
31:37;31:41;"This would probably be a good movie one day or doc series."
31:41;31:44;"The last days of Starbucks-ing, Corona Winter."
31:44;31:46;"- Yeah, as the dominoes are falling."
31:46;31:48;"- Yeah, as the dominoes fall, like, yeah,"
31:48;31:51;"it's kind of just like somebody's on vacation"
31:51;31:55;"just as like, you know, there's a revolution in a country."
31:55;31:58;"- Yeah, we were down in Cuba down in '59"
31:58;32:00;"was at a beautiful resort there."
32:00;32:01;"- I mean, that literally happened"
32:01;32:03;"'cause wasn't it New Year's Eve?"
32:03;32:04;"- Yes, I think you're right."
32:04;32:06;"- So there were all sorts of Americans just like"
32:06;32:09;"partying it up at like a Cuban casino in 1959."
32:09;32:11;"- Just like, whoa, what's going on?"
32:11;32:13;"- I bet it was probably really similar actually"
32:13;32:16;"to some of the stories you hear during like COVID"
32:16;32:18;"because so it was winter."
32:18;32:20;"I'm not talking about winter, the king of Starbucks."
32:20;32:21;"I'm talking about the season."
32:21;32:24;"But so it's winter, New Year's in Havana,"
32:24;32:26;"all these people down there partying."
32:26;32:28;"And then you probably, because it's winter,"
32:28;32:31;"you probably had some other people up in like New England"
32:31;32:33;"or something being like, yeah, we got a trip down"
32:33;32:37;"to Cuba planned for when the kids have February break."
32:37;32:39;"So we're gonna go down about six weeks"
32:39;32:42;"and then just like early January, 1960,"
32:42;32:45;"where it's just kind of like people on the phone"
32:45;32:47;"to their travel agent, just like,"
32:47;32:51;"my husband says that we can't go to Cuba"
32:51;32:52;"until they sort this whole thing out."
32:52;32:54;"And just like, I want a refund."
32:54;32:56;"And like the travel agent just being like,"
32:56;32:58;"ma'am, I'm being assured by everybody"
32:58;33:02;"that this Castro thing is gonna blow over in about a month."
33:02;33:03;"Things will settle down."
33:03;33:06;"And I promise you, you and your family"
33:06;33:08;"will be enjoying the beaches of Cuba"
33:08;33:11;"just as you planned by February."
33:11;33:13;"Like, or it just probably got crazier and crazier."
33:13;33:16;"People were like, are we still going to Cuba?"
33:16;33:18;"- Is that hotel gonna honor our deposit or not?"
33:18;33:21;"- He's gonna reopen the casino soon, right?"
33:21;33:23;"- Are they still doing that seafood buffet?"
33:23;33:25;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
33:25;33:28;"Just like people making international calls"
33:28;33:30;"to like the revolutionaries fully taking over"
33:30;33:34;"just like some mafia hotel, just like the phone ringing,"
33:34;33:38;"just like, hello, is there an English speaker?"
33:38;33:40;"I'm scheduled to arrive in about two weeks."
33:40;33:43;"So anyway, yeah, I guess that's kind of a classic thing."
33:43;33:47;"It's like for everybody who happens to be part"
33:47;33:49;"of a world historical event"
33:49;33:52;"because they're like one of the drivers of that event,"
33:52;33:55;"they're a soldier or a politician or something,"
33:55;33:57;"or even just somebody who lives in the city"
33:57;33:58;"where something's happening."
33:58;34:00;"You're also gonna just get people who are just like,"
34:00;34:02;"man, I'm just passing through."
34:02;34:03;"So yeah, I think we should get Winter on the phone"
34:03;34:07;"'cause I'm very curious about where he's at now"
34:07;34:09;"and what he's seen."
34:09;34:12;"Because everybody I know has been pretty quarantined."
34:12;34:14;"And I wanna hear from somebody"
34:14;34:16;"who not only was out there in the world,"
34:16;34:19;"but was traveling through the world."
34:19;34:20;"So why don't we get Winter on the phone?"
34:20;34:24;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
34:24;34:26;"(phone ringing)"
34:26;34:29;"- Hey folks."
34:29;34:29;"- Hey Winter. - How are you doing?"
34:29;34:31;"Good to see you."
34:31;34:32;"- Good to see you. - You too."
34:32;34:33;"- Good to see you, Winter."
34:33;34:35;"- Well, this is different."
34:35;34:37;"- Yeah, welcome to the video chat."
34:37;34:39;"You know, apparently the group FaceTime"
34:39;34:42;"can handle up to 32 people."
34:42;34:43;"- Wow."
34:43;34:46;"- I was on one recently to sing happy birthday"
34:46;34:48;"to a friend of the show,"
34:48;34:50;"Vampire Weekend producer Ariel Rekshide."
34:50;34:52;"It was recently his birthday."
34:52;34:56;"There was a little birthday surprise organized for him."
34:56;34:57;"And it was like, it was total chaos."
34:57;35:00;"Just like 15 people, just like things,"
35:00;35:02;"all these like little things moving around."
35:02;35:06;"People just like deeply out of sync singing happy birthday."
35:06;35:08;"That's probably gonna happen for me too."
35:08;35:11;"- Great. - It's Ari's season."
35:11;35:13;"- When's your birthday, April?"
35:13;35:14;"- April 8th."
35:14;35:15;"- Okay."
35:15;35:16;"Winter, where are you?"
35:16;35:18;"Are you in the Starbucks?"
35:18;35:22;"- No, nobody is allowed in a Starbucks,"
35:22;35:23;"a corporate Starbucks right now,"
35:23;35:27;"except for a handful that are open for first responders,"
35:27;35:30;"like firefighters and medical personnel."
35:30;35:34;"But all are shut, all the corporate ones."
35:34;35:38;"Maybe there is a licensed one at a grocery store"
35:38;35:41;"that's choosing to remain open."
35:41;35:44;"I don't know, but corporate wide,"
35:44;35:46;"they are all shut as of last Saturday."
35:46;35:48;"- So you're out of luck right now."
35:48;35:54;"- Well, I would say it's Starbucks interrupt us"
35:54;35:55;"for the moment."
35:55;35:57;"- Starbucks interrupt us."
35:57;35:59;"Now, and I hope this question doesn't offend you"
35:59;36:03;"'cause I know you're somebody very engaged with politics"
36:03;36:04;"and you're a very moral person,"
36:04;36:08;"but you're also the world's preeminent Starbucker."
36:08;36:11;"You pose as a first responder to get into a Starbucks."
36:11;36:14;"- I can categorically say that I would not pose"
36:14;36:16;"as a first responder to get into a Starbucks,"
36:16;36:19;"but I like the creativity and thinking, Ezra."
36:19;36:20;"- I'm glad to hear that."
36:20;36:21;"That's what I expected."
36:21;36:23;"But how about this?"
36:23;36:26;"Usually your day job is computer programming, right?"
36:26;36:27;"- That's where I am right now."
36:27;36:32;"That's pretty much the only place I can be in Rochester"
36:32;36:34;"and get wifi is work."
36:34;36:36;"- So would you consider temporarily"
36:36;36:39;"becoming a first responder for access to Starbucks"
36:39;36:41;"or leave it to the professionals?"
36:41;36:43;"- Yet another creative idea."
36:43;36:45;"I'll probably leave it to the professionals."
36:45;36:49;"I have thought about changing my job before,"
36:49;36:50;"like trying to become a journalist"
36:50;36:52;"so I could get into Saudi Arabia"
36:52;36:55;"or trying to get into one of these buildings in Manhattan"
36:55;36:57;"that are restricted."
36:57;37:00;"But I think during a pandemic,"
37:00;37:03;"I need to just back off of the Starbucks a little bit."
37:03;37:05;"- Starbucks pause for the moment."
37:05;37:09;"♪ On the first part of the journey ♪"
37:09;37:13;"♪ I was looking at all the light ♪"
37:13;37:17;"♪ There were plants and birds and rocks and things ♪"
37:17;37:21;"♪ There was sand and hills and rain ♪"
37:21;37:25;"♪ The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz ♪"
37:25;37:29;"♪ And the sky with no clouds ♪"
37:29;37:33;"♪ The heat was hot and the ground was dry ♪"
37:33;37:37;"♪ But the air was full of sound ♪"
37:37;37:41;"♪ I've been through the desert on a horse with no name ♪"
37:41;37:45;"♪ It felt good to be out of the rain ♪"
37:45;37:49;"♪ In the desert you can remember your name ♪"
37:49;37:52;"♪ 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain ♪"
37:52;37:54;"- Okay, so, so many questions, Winter."
37:54;37:55;"I wanna hear about your journey."
37:55;37:57;"So you're in Rochester,"
37:57;37:59;"which has been kind of your home base for a minute."
37:59;38:01;"- Yeah, a year and a half."
38:01;38:03;"I can't even believe that."
38:03;38:06;"- I was just telling Jake how following you on Twitter,"
38:06;38:09;"it seemed like you were on a starbucking run"
38:09;38:14;"just as the US started to really have to deal with COVID-19."
38:14;38:17;"- Yes."
38:17;38:18;"- So where were you?"
38:18;38:20;"And can you kind of just walk us through"
38:20;38:22;"the past few weeks of your life?"
38:22;38:24;"- Okay, well, this trip was pre-planned."
38:24;38:26;"Otherwise I wouldn't have gone."
38:26;38:30;"My mother's down at an assistant living facility in Panama"
38:30;38:32;"and my cousins were getting married last Saturday."
38:32;38:36;"So I timed everything around going down to see her,"
38:36;38:37;"taking her to the wedding,"
38:37;38:39;"buying all her medications and toiletries."
38:39;38:43;"I get down there last, two Wednesdays ago,"
38:43;38:46;"Panama just got its first case of COVID"
38:46;38:48;"and they locked down the nursing home."
38:48;38:49;"So all I can do is run around,"
38:49;38:51;"buy her medications, buy her toiletries."
38:51;38:53;"I'm still going to the wedding by myself."
38:53;38:55;"- Your mom, because she's in a nursing home,"
38:55;38:58;"she wasn't even allowed to go to the family wedding."
38:58;38:59;"- Too much of a risk."
38:59;39:00;"You know, she gets out, gets COVID,"
39:00;39:02;"brings it back in, it's deadly."
39:02;39:06;"So I'm still going to the wedding up until Friday night,"
39:06;39:08;"government cancels all events."
39:08;39:11;"So Saturday morning, I see the writing on the wall"
39:11;39:14;"in terms of airport lockdowns all over the place."
39:14;39:16;"I rushed to the airport,"
39:16;39:19;"get myself on the first flight back to Orlando."
39:19;39:22;"And sure enough, two days later, Panama locks down."
39:22;39:23;"Nobody's getting in."
39:23;39:25;"So I got in just under the wire."
39:25;39:26;"- Wow."
39:26;39:28;"You got out of there in the nick of time."
39:28;39:30;"Why were you flying to Orlando"
39:30;39:33;"and not just back to Rochester for work?"
39:33;39:35;"- Because my car's registered in Texas"
39:35;39:40;"and Texas is a yearly state inspection state."
39:40;39:41;"Other states are not."
39:41;39:43;"But no matter where I'm working,"
39:43;39:44;"every year around this time,"
39:44;39:47;"I got to drop everything and drive back down to Texas"
39:47;39:50;"to get the car inspected before the registration."
39:50;39:55;"This year also happened to be my 10-year license renewal,"
39:55;39:58;"which required certifying that my vision hadn't changed,"
39:58;39:59;"which it had."
39:59;40:01;"So I had to get glasses too."
40:01;40:06;"So just a bunch of things that I had to do mandatory"
40:06;40:08;"as the country is shutting down,"
40:08;40:11;"which turned it into a whole surreal experience."
40:11;40:13;"- And I would imagine that generally speaking,"
40:13;40:17;"because you're the world's preeminent starbucker,"
40:17;40:19;"a lot of people would probably be like,"
40:19;40:20;"""I got a wedding."
40:20;40:21;"I got to go do this."
40:21;40:24;"I got to get glasses and go back to Texas."""
40:24;40:25;"A lot of people would be like,"
40:25;40:27;"""Oh, this is going to be such an annoying trip."""
40:27;40:30;"I imagine that as somebody so dedicated"
40:30;40:32;"to starbucking as you,"
40:32;40:33;"there's a lot of silver lining"
40:33;40:36;"when you got all these errands to run around the world"
40:36;40:37;"where you're kind of like,"
40:37;40:38;"a lot of people are like,"
40:38;40:39;"""How am I going to make this trip fun?"""
40:39;40:41;"And for you, it's like,"
40:41;40:42;"you're probably kind of happy"
40:42;40:45;"because you always have Starbucks to hit, right?"
40:45;40:47;"- In normal times, yes, absolutely."
40:47;40:49;"And for the first half of the trip,"
40:49;40:51;"that's exactly how it was."
40:51;40:52;"Business as usual,"
40:52;40:55;"the only big change from Starbucks"
40:55;40:59;"was no reusable cups in the stores,"
40:59;41:01;"which meant that I typically go in"
41:01;41:03;"with a little sample cup."
41:03;41:05;"I say hi to the manager or the supervisor,"
41:05;41:06;"tell them what I'm doing"
41:06;41:08;"and ask for a sample, hand them the cup."
41:08;41:09;"Most of the time, they'll take it"
41:09;41:11;"unless you're in a place like New York City"
41:11;41:13;"where they don't take any reusable cups."
41:13;41:14;"They clamped down on that."
41:14;41:16;"It still wasn't a problem."
41:16;41:19;"The manager supervisor still just went to the back"
41:19;41:21;"and got me a little sample cup."
41:21;41:22;"- These first few days though,"
41:22;41:23;"you're mostly in Florida."
41:23;41:24;"You just got into your car."
41:24;41:27;"Your car was in Orlando?"
41:27;41:29;"- No, no, I drove down from upstate,"
41:29;41:31;"Syracuse, where I played in a Scrabble tournament."
41:31;41:33;"I drove all the way down to Florida."
41:33;41:35;"So I was hitting Starbucks in Maryland,"
41:35;41:37;"Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,"
41:37;41:40;"Georgia, Florida, until I flew out."
41:40;41:41;"- Okay, so you're Starbucksing"
41:41;41:42;"all the way down to Orlando."
41:42;41:44;"You go to Panama."
41:44;41:46;"You have this kind of crazy experience."
41:46;41:47;"Get out of Panama in the nick of time,"
41:47;41:49;"back in Orlando."
41:49;41:50;"Once you're back in Orlando,"
41:50;41:52;"how much did things change?"
41:52;41:53;"- Okay. - 'Cause we've been hearing"
41:53;41:56;"Florida has been relatively lax as a state."
41:56;42:00;"- First of all, my flight was delayed for over an hour"
42:00;42:04;"because they had to pull a kid off the plane"
42:04;42:05;"and his dad, the kid was crying"
42:05;42:08;"because they'd heard him coughing in the bathroom."
42:08;42:10;"So they did a medical check and they pulled him off."
42:10;42:11;"So that was interesting."
42:11;42:15;"I arrived back in Orlando around 5 p.m."
42:15;42:19;"and I immediately bolt to as many Starbucks as I could."
42:19;42:22;"At that time, I can still go in them"
42:22;42:24;"and hang out, charge my batteries,"
42:24;42:26;"charge my computer, charge my phone."
42:26;42:28;"That's critical stuff for me."
42:28;42:30;"Talk to the managers or supervisors."
42:30;42:31;"Everything's fine."
42:31;42:35;"- And in terms of the number of people in these Starbucks,"
42:35;42:37;"it felt like a typical day?"
42:37;42:39;"- Absolutely."
42:39;42:42;"The very last one that I went to in Davenport, Florida"
42:42;42:45;"was completely busy, business as usual."
42:45;42:46;"- What was the date around that?"
42:46;42:50;"- This was Saturday, March the 14th."
42:50;42:52;"- So Saturday, March 14th,"
42:52;42:55;"you have some people beginning quarantine in the US,"
42:55;42:58;"but as far as the Starbucks that you're hitting in Florida,"
42:58;43:00;"you wouldn't have guessed anything was happening."
43:00;43:01;"- Exactly."
43:01;43:02;"Everything was normal."
43:02;43:05;"There was an email from Kevin Johnson several days later"
43:05;43:09;"saying it was a possibility that stores would move"
43:09;43:12;"to grab and go or drive-through only."
43:12;43:13;"But I hadn't heard of that happening."
43:13;43:17;"Kevin Johnson is the CEO who replaced Howard Schultz."
43:17;43:19;"- Oh, okay."
43:19;43:21;"- Well, Sunday morning, I wake up,"
43:21;43:24;"I go to my first Starbucks in, coincidentally enough,"
43:24;43:26;"Winter Haven, Florida."
43:26;43:29;"And I notice that something seems off."
43:29;43:31;"There's no cars in the parking lot."
43:31;43:34;"There's a white piece of paper on the door."
43:34;43:37;"I go up to the door and boom,"
43:37;43:41;"this store is open to serve you for grab and go only."
43:41;43:43;"And they have closed the restrooms."
43:43;43:46;"- Grab and go means you could still enter the store"
43:46;43:48;"as usual, just can't sit."
43:48;43:49;"- That's correct."
43:49;43:52;"As soon as I went to plug in my laptop on my phone,"
43:52;43:54;"the supervisor told me that I couldn't hang out."
43:54;43:56;"I said, ""Okay, yeah, I understand."
43:56;43:57;"I'm just gonna get my coffee."""
43:57;44:00;"Unfortunately, I couldn't use the restroom."
44:00;44:02;"At that point, by the way, I'm thinking,"
44:02;44:05;"""Okay, all thoughts of asking for a sample are gone."
44:05;44:06;"I'm just gonna have to suck it up"
44:06;44:09;"and pay $2.25 for a coffee"
44:09;44:12;"for however many stores I go to in the next week."""
44:12;44:13;"You know, it's not the end of the world."
44:13;44:14;"It's a pandemic."
44:14;44:17;"So I adjust to the new reality."
44:17;44:18;"- But the bathroom thing,"
44:18;44:19;"you tweeted about this a little bit."
44:19;44:21;"Generally, when you Starbucks,"
44:21;44:23;"you're not staying in hotels,"
44:23;44:25;"you'll sleep in the car most nights."
44:25;44:25;"- That is correct."
44:25;44:27;"So one of the first things I do"
44:27;44:29;"to when I get that first Starbucks in the morning,"
44:29;44:32;"typically, is I wanna wash my hands."
44:32;44:33;"I wanna wash my face."
44:33;44:35;"I just wanna wash up."
44:35;44:37;"And during this pandemic,"
44:37;44:40;"when everybody was telling people not to touch their face"
44:40;44:42;"and to wash their hands, I ramped that up."
44:42;44:45;"So I was basically washing my hands"
44:45;44:47;"every time I went into a Starbucks."
44:47;44:50;"Basically, anytime I was anywhere and I touched anything,"
44:50;44:52;"I was just washing my hands."
44:52;44:53;"And all of a sudden I can't do that anymore."
44:53;44:55;"And I'm like, ""Okay, I gotta adjust."""
44:55;44:58;"So my adjustment is stop for gas more often"
44:58;45:02;"and use the bathroom there to wash my hands."
45:02;45:04;"So two stores were like that."
45:04;45:07;"Third store, further north,"
45:07;45:09;"that one was still open for business."
45:09;45:12;"Different district, different region."
45:12;45:15;"So I learned at that one from talking to the manager"
45:15;45:20;"who was wearing an N95 mask because she had cystic fibrosis."
45:20;45:23;"So getting COVID for her is a big deal."
45:23;45:24;"- Oh God, yeah."
45:24;45:25;"- So I really felt bad for her"
45:25;45:27;"and I understood why she was being so cautious,"
45:27;45:29;"but she decided that she was gonna keep the store open"
45:29;45:31;"that day, she was gonna go the next day."
45:31;45:33;"And basically I learned that stores had been given"
45:33;45:38;"until Thursday to make the switch over, to grab and go."
45:38;45:40;"And some decided to go immediately."
45:40;45:41;"Some decided to go a little bit later."
45:41;45:43;"She explained that for some it had to do"
45:43;45:47;"with how many COVID cases were reported in the area"
45:47;45:49;"and the proximity."
45:49;45:52;"So that's what I discovered for the rest,"
45:52;45:53;"for the next few days."
45:53;45:55;"Some were open, some weren't."
45:55;45:59;"In some cities like Gainesville, Florida,"
45:59;46:03;"I actually met up with the brother of Bill Tangeman"
46:03;46:07;"who directed the ""Starbucking"" documentary back in 2007."
46:07;46:08;"So he's been following me,"
46:08;46:11;"but I was able to hang out there and chat with him."
46:11;46:13;"Then I go to another store in Gainesville,"
46:13;46:15;"it's only open for grab and go."
46:15;46:19;"♪ After two days in the desert sun ♪"
46:19;46:23;"♪ My skin began to turn red ♪"
46:23;46:27;"♪ After three days in the desert fun ♪"
46:27;46:31;"♪ I was looking at a river bed ♪"
46:31;46:35;"♪ And the story it told of a river that flowed ♪"
46:35;46:39;"♪ Made me sad to think it was dead ♪"
46:39;46:41;"♪ You see I've been through the desert ♪"
46:41;46:43;"♪ On a horse with no name ♪"
46:43;46:46;"♪ It felt good to be out of the rain ♪"
46:46;46:50;"♪ In the desert you can't remember your name ♪"
46:50;46:52;"♪ 'Cause there ain't no one ♪"
46:52;46:54;"♪ Born to give you no pain ♪"
46:54;46:57;"So that's Florida and Georgia and Alabama."
46:57;47:01;"Wasn't even able to go to one in Alabama"
47:01;47:02;"because it closed early."
47:02;47:04;"Don't know if that was related to COVID"
47:04;47:06;"or if that was just a Sunday closure."
47:08;47:12;"Here's funny thing, Panama City Beach was closed"
47:12;47:14;"before I got there, not because of COVID,"
47:14;47:16;"but because they had a boil water order"
47:16;47:18;"in all of Panama City Beach."
47:18;47:21;"So that was kind of ironic."
47:21;47:24;"- Boil water order means that there's something"
47:24;47:25;"in the water supply,"
47:25;47:27;"meaning that you can't drink tap water?"
47:27;47:28;"- That's correct."
47:28;47:29;"So all of the Starbucks in Panama City Beach"
47:29;47:32;"were shut down for several days."
47:32;47:35;"So I had to skip that one and head straight to New Orleans."
47:35;47:39;"And that was Monday morning, 16th."
47:39;47:41;"And that was an interesting experience"
47:41;47:45;"because the first Starbucks that I went to"
47:45;47:47;"did not have a drive-through."
47:47;47:48;"It was completely open,"
47:48;47:51;"but the managers were talking about"
47:51;47:54;"how they were gonna be switching to a grab-and-go model."
47:54;47:55;"And I was already starting to wonder,"
47:55;47:58;"okay, what's that gonna do to the people"
47:58;47:59;"who just hang out at Starbucks?"
47:59;48:02;"New Orleans has a lot of indigent, of course."
48:02;48:04;"They'll hang out, they'll charge their devices,"
48:04;48:05;"they'll use the wifi."
48:05;48:08;"So that's obviously going to affect them."
48:08;48:10;"The next store that I went to"
48:10;48:13;"had already switched to grab-and-go,"
48:13;48:17;"but the next day it was switching to drive-through only."
48:17;48:20;"So they were getting ahead of the drive-through curve."
48:20;48:23;"The third store I went to was on the other side of the river"
48:23;48:25;"in the Algiers neighborhood."
48:25;48:28;"That manager actually got a little bit snippy with me."
48:28;48:33;"I went in, I plugged in my laptop, my phone on the floor."
48:33;48:34;"I wasn't really working there."
48:34;48:37;"I was just getting my coffee, took a picture, went back in,"
48:37;48:38;"asked her some questions"
48:38;48:41;"about where New Orleans was going with this."
48:41;48:43;"And after some point, I guess I wore up my welcome"
48:43;48:45;"and she said, ""I'm gonna have to ask you to leave."
48:45;48:47;"""Get your stuff and go."""
48:47;48:50;"Okay, well, in the middle of a pandemic,"
48:50;48:53;"people's nerves start to fray, so I totally understood that."
48:53;48:55;"My next stop was more interesting."
48:55;49:00;"That was Congregation Coffee in Algiers Point,"
49:00;49:02;"a independent coffee shop"
49:02;49:04;"that was actually selected by ""Food & Wine"" magazine"
49:04;49:07;"last year as their favorite coffee roaster"
49:07;49:10;"in the state of Louisiana."
49:10;49:14;"There, that gave me an opportunity to talk to the owners"
49:14;49:16;"about what they thought this pandemic"
49:16;49:17;"was gonna do to the business."
49:17;49:20;"And the owner was quite frank in saying"
49:20;49:22;"he didn't think they were gonna make it"
49:22;49:24;"to the other side of this."
49:24;49:26;"And that was something that I'd been reading already"
49:26;49:29;"about how this was going to start hurting small businesses."
49:29;49:32;"And my focus is Starbucks,"
49:32;49:33;"but I'm really trying to promote"
49:33;49:35;"and talk up the small coffee houses."
49:35;49:38;"I have a keen interest in what's gonna happen to them."
49:38;49:40;"And I feel really bad that a lot of them"
49:40;49:42;"are not gonna make it through this pandemic."
49:42;49:44;"So I was glad that I was able to give them"
49:44;49:47;"a little bit of business for a while and talk up his cafe."
49:47;49:49;"I hope he sells a lot of beans"
49:49;49:51;"because that's how they're gonna have to survive"
49:51;49:54;"when they can't actually sell coffee with everything closed."
49:54;49:56;"- You make a good point, Winter,"
49:56;49:58;"is that people talk so much about,"
49:58;50:02;"obviously this is a very difficult time for restaurants"
50:02;50:05;"and especially the people who work at restaurants,"
50:05;50:08;"servers and things like that who are being let go."
50:08;50:09;"They don't need the whole staff."
50:09;50:11;"I guess the only thing you could hope for"
50:11;50:15;"that at a restaurant, there's still people ordering food"
50:15;50:16;"and they can still be preparing stuff,"
50:16;50:19;"but a coffee shop, you know,"
50:19;50:21;"you're not gonna find a ton of people"
50:21;50:23;"putting in big orders for coffee"
50:23;50:26;"to be delivered to their homes or something."
50:26;50:28;"So even more than restaurants, I can imagine"
50:28;50:30;"that these kind of like cool,"
50:30;50:34;"kind vibe little coffee shops, independent ones"
50:34;50:37;"are really gonna be hit because outside of selling beans,"
50:37;50:39;"what can they do?"
50:39;50:41;"So as you're making it through,"
50:41;50:43;"you're noticing the tensions rising"
50:43;50:46;"with some of the managers, you're noticing things changing."
50:46;50:48;"You barely got out of Panama, you made it to Florida,"
50:48;50:49;"you're traveling to the South."
50:49;50:51;"By the time you're in New Orleans,"
50:51;50:54;"there must be a pretty big black cloud"
50:54;50:56;"hanging over your whole trip."
50:56;50:59;"Do you think about just bailing on the Texas car stuff"
50:59;51:01;"and just getting back to Rochester?"
51:01;51:05;"Like, did you kind of feel like the doors were closing?"
51:05;51:06;"You know?"
51:06;51:08;"- Yes, I did feel like the doors were closing."
51:08;51:10;"No, I didn't consider bailing."
51:10;51:11;"It's not an option."
51:11;51:12;"I have to renew my license."
51:12;51:14;"I have to renew my registration"
51:14;51:16;"or I'm gonna get arrested at some point."
51:16;51:18;"I wanna see my dentist under the wire"
51:18;51:19;"and I need to get those glasses too"
51:19;51:21;"because I'm having trouble driving at night."
51:21;51:22;"It's a safety issue."
51:22;51:26;"So I was gonna go to Texas no matter what"
51:26;51:29;"and the process was actually stressful."
51:29;51:31;"Typically, Starbucks is relaxing."
51:31;51:32;"It's like, it's great."
51:32;51:34;"I'm getting away from work, I'm doing my thing,"
51:34;51:36;"I'm talking to the managers,"
51:36;51:39;"taking all these great pictures, posting on Instagram."
51:39;51:42;"This time around, it was just a constant day by day,"
51:42;51:45;"how do I adapt to the new situation?"
51:45;51:47;"How do I keep my phone charged?"
51:47;51:49;"How do I keep my laptops charged?"
51:49;51:50;"How do I keep my camera battery charged?"
51:50;51:52;"Where do I wash my hands?"
51:52;51:53;"All that kind of thing."
51:53;51:55;"And as I kept traveling, where do I eat?"
51:55;51:57;"What restaurants are gonna be closed?"
51:57;52:00;"That was pretty much the rest of the week for me"
52:00;52:04;"as I was documenting the slow rolling shutdown"
52:04;52:09;"of the United States for essentially a seven day period,"
52:09;52:11;"seeing it from the front lines."
52:11;52:15;"It was quite educational, but it was also stressful"
52:15;52:19;"and it was depressing because I was seeing"
52:19;52:21;"that all these people were starting to lose their jobs"
52:21;52:23;"with all these places closed"
52:23;52:25;"and it's just gonna be devastating"
52:25;52:27;"for the people who work in the service economy"
52:27;52:29;"and I really, really feel bad for them."
52:29;52:31;"- Yeah, seriously."
52:31;52:33;"So by the time you got to Texas,"
52:33;52:37;"you were still able to accomplish all of your tasks,"
52:37;52:40;"your dentist and optometrist and all this stuff."
52:40;52:42;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got everything done."
52:42;52:45;"I checked in on my dad just to see if he was okay."
52:45;52:47;"Didn't hug him, didn't shake his hand,"
52:47;52:48;"tried to stay a little bit away,"
52:48;52:52;"but he had his issues a couple of years ago"
52:52;52:54;"and I just needed to make sure that he was okay"
52:54;52:58;"and not just saying he was okay over the phone."
52:58;53:01;"And then I left Texas, went up to Dallas"
53:01;53:05;"and by that point, it was all grab and go."
53:05;53:07;"So I didn't get to see,"
53:07;53:09;"go into any of the Starbucks in the Dallas market"
53:09;53:11;"and at that point, I made a decision"
53:11;53:16;"that in keeping with the whole idea of social distancing,"
53:16;53:18;"I was going to put a heavy emphasis"
53:18;53:21;"on re-photographing old stores,"
53:21;53:23;"stores that I'd been to at night"
53:23;53:26;"or stores for which I'd lost the photograph"
53:26;53:28;"when my computer was stolen, et cetera, et cetera."
53:28;53:30;"That way I'd go to fewer stores"
53:30;53:32;"and I'd go to more remote stores."
53:32;53:34;"So I went ahead and went out of the way"
53:34;53:36;"to College Station, Texas,"
53:36;53:39;"where sadly, one of your TC fans,"
53:39;53:42;"Starbucking fans wanted to meet me,"
53:42;53:44;"but I was supposed to meet people in Dallas"
53:44;53:47;"and College Station in Austin and San Antonio,"
53:47;53:48;"but because of the pandemic,"
53:48;53:51;"that just wasn't gonna happen."
53:51;53:52;"Exactly."
53:52;53:55;"And that was sad because I feel like"
53:55;53:57;"if somebody's going through the trouble"
53:57;53:58;"of sending me an email"
53:58;54:01;"and taking an interest in my Starbucking project,"
54:01;54:03;"I'm happy to have a cup of coffee with them"
54:03;54:05;"and that just wasn't gonna happen,"
54:05;54:08;"but this is the new reality that we live with."
54:08;54:11;"I went down from Dallas market"
54:11;54:15;"all the way out to Weatherford, Mineral Wells,"
54:15;54:19;"down some towns outside of Austin, San Antonio,"
54:19;54:20;"all the way out to Uvalde,"
54:20;54:22;"and then I decided that I was gonna go ahead"
54:22;54:25;"and drive all the way out to El Paso."
54:25;54:27;"And some TC heads probably saw my tweet"
54:27;54:30;"where I said that with all the stress"
54:30;54:32;"of adapting to the nation shutting down,"
54:32;54:36;"the seven hour drive to El Paso"
54:36;54:38;"was actually the most relaxing part of my week"
54:38;54:40;"because I didn't have to worry about,"
54:40;54:43;"I mean, it was about as socially isolated as you can get."
54:43;54:44;"Other than stopping for gas,"
54:44;54:46;"it was just driving, driving, driving."
54:46;54:50;"Well, it's funny because anybody"
54:50;54:53;"who's been a touring musician or a resident of Texas"
54:53;54:56;"has at some point done the kind of epic drive"
54:56;55:00;"from the really dense populated part of Texas."
55:00;55:01;"I don't know if you call it East Texas,"
55:01;55:03;"but you know where all the big cities"
55:03;55:04;"aren't that far away from each other."
55:04;55:07;"They're within two to four hours of each other."
55:07;55:11;"And then you have this huge expanse of West Texas"
55:11;55:12;"until you get to El Paso,"
55:12;55:15;"which sometimes that drive feels like"
55:15;55:17;"you're not seeing a lot of other cars,"
55:17;55:19;"you're not seeing a lot of civilization,"
55:19;55:21;"there's only a handful of places to stop."
55:21;55:24;"And Jake, actually, I may have done that drive"
55:24;55:25;"for the first time with you, Jake,"
55:25;55:27;"when we were touring with Dirty Projectors."
55:27;55:29;"And I'm pretty sure this is a,"
55:29;55:33;"West Texas to me is a very Jake type place."
55:33;55:36;"And I'm pretty sure, Jake, that you told me"
55:36;55:38;"that Cormac McCarthy,"
55:38;55:40;"who wrote the post-apocalyptic novel ""The Road"""
55:40;55:43;"was inspired by driving through West Texas."
55:43;55:44;"- Right."
55:44;55:47;"I remember reading that he had the idea for ""The Road"""
55:47;55:52;"when he was staying at a motel in El Paso"
55:52;55:54;"with his infant son"
55:54;55:57;"and looking out on the lights of El Paso Juarez."
55:57;56:01;"And I think maybe having this very vulnerable baby"
56:01;56:04;"in his care and thinking about,"
56:04;56:08;"yeah, just the barren wilds out there."
56:08;56:11;"- Right, 'cause West Texas is very beautiful,"
56:11;56:14;"but it feels very empty compared to other parts of Texas."
56:14;56:15;"And yeah, I imagine even,"
56:15;56:17;"I'm sure he probably said it more eloquently,"
56:17;56:21;"but I've also had this experience of being in El Paso,"
56:21;56:22;"actually with you, Jake,"
56:22;56:24;"I remember the first time I ever had Migos"
56:24;56:27;"was at an IHOP in El Paso."
56:27;56:29;"- I remember the IHOP in El Paso."
56:29;56:31;"- So we hit an IHOP in El Paso,"
56:31;56:32;"a lot of touring musicians have."
56:32;56:34;"But there's something about being in El Paso"
56:34;56:37;"and then you look and you see Juarez."
56:37;56:40;"And I don't know if there's any other,"
56:40;56:43;"obviously there's a lot of border cities in America."
56:43;56:45;"I don't think there's any cities as big as El Paso"
56:45;56:46;"on the US border"
56:46;56:49;"where you can just see Mexico quite so clearly."
56:49;56:51;"And you see that big mountain that says,"
56:51;56:53;"""La Biblia es la verdad."""
56:53;56:55;"And there is something about being in El Paso"
56:55;56:58;"and you're staring at another country"
56:58;57:00;"that also kind of reminds you too,"
57:00;57:04;"how arbitrary and flimsy this idea of like,"
57:04;57:08;"these like civilizational ideas of like borders are."
57:08;57:11;"So I can imagine maybe that played some factor,"
57:11;57:12;"the West Texas vibe."
57:12;57:13;"And then just kind of,"
57:13;57:15;"you're like looking across this imaginary border"
57:15;57:16;"that means so much to people."
57:16;57:17;"And you're just like,"
57:17;57:19;"a few things change in the world,"
57:19;57:20;"this border is meaningless."
57:20;57:23;"You know, it makes you think about like,"
57:23;57:25;"civilization and all that kind of (beep)"
57:25;57:28;"So anyway, it kind of seems almost mystical to me,"
57:28;57:31;"Winter, that you and Cormac McCarthy,"
57:31;57:32;"he who wrote a post-apocalyptic novel,"
57:32;57:35;"and you who had a somewhat apocalyptic"
57:35;57:36;"starbucking journey,"
57:36;57:38;"both end up in El Paso."
57:38;57:41;"Like it kind of weird synergy to me."
57:41;57:43;"And it all converged in El Paso."
57:43;57:45;"- His was post-apocalyptic,"
57:45;57:47;"mine was pre-apocalyptic."
57:47;57:48;"- Yeah, exactly."
57:48;57:52;"You finally pulled into the West Texas town of El Paso."
57:52;57:54;"What was the vibe there?"
57:54;57:56;"- I saw the four stores there,"
57:56;57:57;"grab and go."
57:57;58:00;"The partners were all kind of laid back."
58:00;58:00;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
58:00;58:02;"- Nope, no bad vibes."
58:02;58:04;"- Wait, there's only four Starbucks in El Paso?"
58:04;58:05;"- New ones, four new Starbucks."
58:05;58:07;"- Okay, all right, all right."
58:07;58:09;"- Yeah, I saw them."
58:09;58:11;"- How many total do you know offhand?"
58:11;58:13;"- Oh, geez."
58:13;58:14;"Just trying to make a mental image."
58:14;58:17;"I would say about 10, roughly."
58:17;58:18;"Don't quote me on that."
58:18;58:19;"I have to check my database."
58:19;58:21;"- Yeah, El Paso's 20."
58:21;58:23;"- Yeah, I would have guessed easily 20."
58:23;58:24;"Interesting."
58:24;58:26;"- But I managed to clear them all out so quickly."
58:26;58:29;"And the reason that I went so fast"
58:29;58:32;"was because either in El Paso or maybe Uvalde,"
58:32;58:33;"I think it was Uvalde,"
58:33;58:35;"I was told by one of the partners"
58:35;58:38;"that they were switching to the drive-through model"
58:38;58:40;"starting Saturday nationwide."
58:40;58:41;"- Right."
58:41;58:43;"- So that was my last shot."
58:43;58:44;"- And that's where we're at now"
58:44;58:46;"in terms of nationwide Starbucks"
58:46;58:47;"is for the past five days."
58:47;58:50;"- Saturday the 21st."
58:50;58:51;"- They're all drive-through only."
58:51;58:54;"- Yes, except for that handful for first responders."

59:43;59:48;"are they allowing pedestrians to use the drive-through?"
59:48;59:51;"- Yes, I was hoping that somebody would chime in,"
59:51;59:53;"but nobody's given me an answer yet."
59:53;59:54;"I'm sure that's one-- - Oh, so you don't know."
59:54;59:56;"You're not hearing about it? - No, no, I'm sure that"
59:56;59:59;"once this airs, somebody who is a Starbucks partner"
59:59;01:00:01;"and a TC fan will know the answer to that."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"- I guarantee you they're not,"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"'cause that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen."

01:00:10;01:00:12;"drive through at two in the morning,"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"and they're like, ""Sir."""
01:00:13;01:00:15;"I've tried to do that before."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"And I remember being told like,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"""Sir, you need to be in a car."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"""It's for your safety and to protect ourselves"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"""against lawsuits."""
01:00:22;01:00:24;"- I've also done that. - In fact, have you?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"- I feel like I have a memory."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"My mom telling me some story about me being like a baby"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"or a toddler."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"I can't imagine where, I guess New Jersey, I don't know."
01:00:34;01:00:37;"She was somewhere pushing me in a stroller"
01:00:37;01:00:41;"and she tried to hit a drive-thru McDonald's with a stroller."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"Maybe she was thinking, ""I'm not just a pedestrian."
01:00:44;01:00:47;"""I have a vehicle."" (laughs)"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"- That is-- (laughs)"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"- But she told me that-- - That's straight up reckless."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"- Yeah, that's actually kind of out of character."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"Maybe I'm misremembering the story,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"but she was not allowed to."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"But yeah, you're probably right."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"There must be rules that drives through for cars only."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"But that's (beep) up."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"What if you don't have a car, but you really need a coffee?"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"- I don't think there's an answer to that."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"I guess new times, new reality."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"But anyway, I sped through El Paso for that reason."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"I was hoping to make it all the way to Santa Fe"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"so I could still see that store from the inside."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"That one was a close, it was just too far."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"I made it to Las Cruces-- - That's really far."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"- Yeah, I thought it was closer."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Once I plotted it out, it was really far."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"So that picture that I posted in Las Cruces"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"was the last one that I was able to take"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"from inside Starbucks."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"Honestly, like I told the baristas, I said,"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"""It feels kind of sad."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"""It's gonna be my last time inside a Starbucks"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"""for the foreseeable future."""
01:01:42;01:01:45;"The only other picture of a mural"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"that I was able to post during that trip"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"was in Asylum Springs, Arkansas."
01:01:50;01:01:53;"I just happened and put it through the drive-thru window."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"They're like, ""Oh man, that is a cool mural."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"""I really wanna get a picture of it."""
01:01:57;01:02:01;"And then I thought, well, it's pretty well lit"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"on the inside."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"What happens if I just go up to the door"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"and shoot through the window?"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"The picture came out pretty nice,"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"but I do have to wonder what the baristas were thinking."
01:02:14;01:02:18;"- I've had the cops call on me quite a few times"
01:02:18;01:02:21;"when I've been shooting the architecture"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"of fast food restaurants and corporate retail."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"The one where I was really asking for it,"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"it was probably a year or two after 9/11."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"I set up, it was in the middle of the night."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"It was like 11 o'clock or midnight"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"at a Taco Bell in Portland, Oregon."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"And I set up a camera on a tripod,"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"'cause it was dark out,"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"right next to the drive-thru of a Taco Bell."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"So the people working at the drive-thru"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"and the customers going through could,"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"I was like four feet away from them."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"- So you're on the Taco Bell property?"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"- Yes, I'm sort of like, I was setting,"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"I'd set the tripod up,"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"sort of like the legs of the tripod were sort of"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"in and among like the landscaping"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"adjacent to the drive-thru."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"I waved at everyone to kind of indicate"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"that I was like not like a psycho"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"and I was like a perfectly like friendly person,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"but people were like really weirded out,"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"which I understand."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"And there's a guy with a tripod shooting pictures of you"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"getting your food from a Taco Bell."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"And then the cop showed up and I just was like,"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"hey, I'm an artist, I'm a photographer,"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"I'm just shooting this stuff."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"- Did you have to like pull up your website?"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- I don't think I did that,"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"but I did like get into a bit of an art history talk."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"I was like, you know that famous painting by Edward Hopper,"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"the Nighthawks of the guys in the diner,"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"like sitting alone in the diner eating?"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"- Oh yeah, there was a viral tweet"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"of that picture being emptied."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"- That's true, that's true."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"- Yeah, right, recently."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"So the cops knew it?"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- Yeah, they were sort of like, oh, okay, yeah,"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"I get it, I get it."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"It's like, this is like an update on that."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"It's just like a Taco Bell."
01:03:47;01:03:50;"And then they're like, okay, I kind of get that."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"You still have to pack it up and leave."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"Taco Bell is, this is private property."
01:03:54;01:03:54;"- Yeah."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"- Have you had the cops called a lot on you, Winter?"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"- Oh, Jesus Christ."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"If I ever write a book,"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"an entire chapter is gonna be my experiences"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"with police and or security."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"I mean, just like- - I can only imagine."
01:04:08;01:04:11;"- I mean, we could do an entire show,"
01:04:11;01:04:15;"which is just Winter getting hassled by security."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- Yeah, we gotta have you,"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"especially during these quarantine times."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"We have a lot of shows we're doing weekly."
01:04:21;01:04:24;"We can really get into some deeper Winter stories."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"I mean, but just real quick, I gotta ask,"
01:04:27;01:04:31;"there's something about a tripod that is kind of scary."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"- Yeah."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"- And you probably had like this big camera."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"- I had like a big, weird, old film camera."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- 'Cause a tripod, it's like, you know,"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"there's like those little tripods that snipers use."
01:04:42;01:04:42;"- Okay."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"- It's, I'm just saying."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"- Yeah, it's a knockout."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"No, it's dark out."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"- It's not a million miles away"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"from some sort of like military equipment"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"or, you know, just something like freaky."
01:04:54;01:04:57;"But Winter, I mean, I understand that"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"you're in a lot of different situations"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"'cause you're constantly traveling,"
01:05:00;01:05:04;"but you're not, all you're rolling with"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"is just in your cup and your phone, really."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"There's nothing,"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"you're not carrying a lot of gear with you."
01:05:10;01:05:14;"- No, but I do shoot in the US and Canada."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"I shoot with a DSLR."
01:05:16;01:05:19;"I don't set up a tripod anymore, but you know,"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"- Oh, you used to though."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"- I used to, that drew a lot of attention."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"I finally decided that I just didn't need to do that."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"I used to do it to try and get"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"really nice photographs at night."
01:05:29;01:05:33;"Now what I do is I'll take the photograph at night,"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"hold the camera in my hand, it may be a little blurry,"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"but I'll make a notation on my map to come back later"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"and take another picture in the daylight."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"- You know, it's so funny."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"This is how I found your work all those years ago, Winter,"
01:05:43;01:05:47;"because you had that website, starbuckseverywhere.net,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"and you had thousands of photographs of Starbucks."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"And I was really deep into that world as well"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"from my own art practice."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"And anyway, it's just funny, like 15 years later,"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"we're talking about this."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"- Yeah, so that, - Crazy."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"- We were in, where were we?"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"We were in Asylum Springs, Arkansas."
01:06:04;01:06:07;"That was the, I think the only,"
01:06:07;01:06:10;"one of two stores that I saw that day"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"because everything was shutting down."
01:06:11;01:06:14;"I also got to see the new roastery"
01:06:14;01:06:18;"for Onyx Coffee in Rogers, Arkansas."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"Actually, one of the, either TC fans"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"or one of the people who saw the Vice video"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"sent me an email saying,"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"""Hey, I noticed that you've been to our old location."
01:06:27;01:06:30;"""You gotta come and see this roastery."""
01:06:30;01:06:32;"But that was towards the tail end of the shutdown."
01:06:32;01:06:36;"By that point, most of the places where I'm at"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"are shut down, even to the extent that Discount Tire,"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"I had to get my tire repaired"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"'cause I had a split in the slide wall."
01:06:43;01:06:46;"They were only doing critical repairs."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"They wanted you to wait out in your car."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"They wanted to minimize people in the lobby once you paid."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"Like, they didn't want you to wait inside the lobby."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"They were slower than usual"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"because instead of the normal,"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"they pull your car into the bay,"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"they didn't wanna get into people's cars."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"So they were having people pull their own cars into the bay."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"- Wow, this is in Rogers, Arkansas?"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"- No, that was Clovis, New Mexico."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"That was the store that I saw after Las Cruces."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"So again, I took a route"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"that took me through a remote store"
01:07:15;01:07:19;"just to maximize driving, minimize social interaction."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"- Wait, wait, so you drove from Orlando to New Mexico"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"and then from New Mexico back to Rochester, New York?"
01:07:25;01:07:30;"- Yeah, I did Las Cruces to Rochester in roughly two days."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"- Ouch. - Oh my God."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"All right, so just bring us to the end."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Explain those two days from New Mexico"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"to Rochester, New York."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"What's that, like 2,000 miles?"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"- Yeah, yeah, it's about 2,000 miles."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Just, you know, pretty much all driving"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"except for that stop in Asylum Springs"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"and the stop in Terre Haute, Indiana."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"I had to skip Festus, Missouri"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"because, oh, here's something else on the Starbucks front."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"Even though they were having their drive-thru stores open,"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"they could not maintain all of them open"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"because this is a really great thing that Starbucks did."
01:08:04;01:08:08;"They committed to paying their partners for first two weeks"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"and then they extended that to 30 days"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"even if they weren't willing to come in for safety."
01:08:13;01:08:18;"So because of that, a city like Springfield, Missouri,"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"where I stopped to reshoot some stores,"
01:08:20;01:08:24;"only had one store open out of like six maybe."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"And then lots of stores in the St. Louis market"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"were shut down, including the one that I needed to see."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"Other stores had reduced hours."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"So I didn't get to see Westfield, Indiana"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"because it shut down early because of the slowdown."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"And so then my next final one"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"was going to be Reynoldsburg, Ohio."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"It was supposed to shut down at 10 p.m."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"and I would have just barely made it"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"like if I floored it all the way out there,"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"but they were gonna shut down early,"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"again, because of a staffing issue."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"So that was pretty much the end of my"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"""Things Fall Apart"" Starbucks tour."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"- Crazy."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"So my last question is just when you're beelining it"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"and you're doing an epic drive like that for two days,"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"how much are you sleeping at night?"
01:09:04;01:09:08;"- Depends on whether it's an extended trip"
01:09:08;01:09:11;"or whether I know I'm gonna get a chance to catch up."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"This time around, I knew that once I got to my job"
01:09:14;01:09:17;"in Rochester and rolled in like Monday around lunchtime,"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"I could just check in, put in a few hours of work"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"before I got tired and then catch up on sleep."
01:09:22;01:09:27;"But if I'm like beelining because I'm going to see a concert"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"or because I'm going to a Scrabble competition"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"and then beyond that, I'm gonna keep traveling,"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"I try not to push myself on the sleep too much"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"because it does screw up with your immune system."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"And right now- - Oh, definitely important."
01:09:41;01:09:45;"- With the assumption that possibly two thirds"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"of the American population are going to get this virus,"
01:09:48;01:09:51;"I want to have a strong immune system"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"so I can fight it off if I'm gonna get it anyway."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"I'm in New York, you know that New York"
01:09:55;01:09:59;"is now the epicenter of COVID in the US."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"As of yesterday, 6% of all global cases."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"I happen to have lucked out that I'm in Monroe County,"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"which is Rochester, which had the, of the big areas,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"it had the lowest number."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"But you never know, I just don't want to exhaust myself."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"I want to stay healthy, stay stress-free"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"and just fight off that virus when I get it."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"- Hell yeah. - Jake and I,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"and most of the people that we're in direct contact with"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"have basically been staying put,"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"quarantined the past couple of weeks."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"So I can't even imagine being in the situation"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"where you had to be on the road"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"and like you're kind of seeing these things in real time."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- Yeah. - It must've been"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"a very strange time to be out there on the road."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- It was rather surreal."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"I'm kind of glad that I got to see it from the ground"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"rather than seeing all these reports."
01:10:41;01:10:44;"And I'm kind of glad that I got to talk to the owners"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"of some of these independent cafes,"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"because, you know, I'll say it again,"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"my heart is really with America's small businesses."
01:10:50;01:10:53;"I don't want to live in a country"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"that's all Starbucks and McDonald's and Best Buy"
01:10:55;01:10:59;"and Walmart when we get to the other side of this."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"- Yep, true words. - Absolutely."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Well, glad you made it."
01:11:04;01:11:05;"Yeah, you keep staying safe"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"and we'll check in with you real soon"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"'cause we've got plenty more to talk about."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"- All right, folks. - All right, good seeing you."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"- Have a good talk and you again."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"- Good to see you. - Anytime."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"- Thank you, thanks for taking the time."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"- Bye-bye."

01:12:08;01:12:10;"- This show rules."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"- So Jake, on our previous episode,"
01:12:12;01:12:16;"we talked about you putting together a new playlist"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"for all the TC heads who are quarantined."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"- Yeah."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"- Or if they're not quarantined,"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"they're out there putting their necks on the line"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"for other people."
01:12:25;01:12:29;"So no matter what, people need some good music"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"and you put together the Old Wisdom playlist."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"I can't remember, what exactly was the prompt?"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"I remember we were talking about that now's a good time"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"to dig into some of that older music"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"and try to draw some of that older wisdom out of it."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"What did you go into making this playlist with?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"What were your parameters?"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"- Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a little bit"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"of an open-ended prompt."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"I ended up finding music that I thought"
01:12:51;01:12:56;"sort of addressed hardship and difficulty and struggle,"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"but at the end of the day was sort of like redemptive"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"in its own, like the music is not despairing."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"- Did you keep it explicitly 1970s?"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"- No, it's 60s and 70s heavy."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"I mean, it's me, you know."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"- Oh yeah, I just saw there's some Little Wings in there."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"So you made all the way to the 2000s."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"- Yeah, there was like a Silver G song, a Little Wing song,"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"just songs that I just felt like, yeah,"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"like acknowledged some like struggle and hardship,"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"but also kind of saw light at the end of the tunnel."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"It's a loose prompt."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- Yeah, see, we've got a lot of some good country,"
01:13:29;01:13:33;"some 80s Bonnie Raitt, Ricky Nelson, ""Garden Party."""
01:13:33;01:13:36;"I got really into that song recently, actually."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"- Yeah, that's a great song."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"You know, that's a song he wrote"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"about playing in Madison Square Garden."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"- I know, it's such a witty title."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- Yeah."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"- I was reading about it, that basically Ricky Nelson,"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"he was really big in like the, he was on TV"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"and he was an early rock and roll guy"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"who was also known as an actor."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"So he was really big in the 50s and like early 60s."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"- Yeah."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"- And I guess by the 70s, he was probably saying,"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"""Well, it's official, buddy."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"""I'm a has-been."""
01:14:01;01:14:03;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:14:03;01:14:03;"- To his personal assistant."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"- Very Rick Dalton-ed out."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- Yeah, very Rick Dalton-ed out, yeah."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"But so Ricky Nelson, he was a bit of a has-been by the 70s,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"but you know, you're still like this kind"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"of early rock and roll guy."
01:14:13;01:14:18;"And I guess he went to some kind of like rock and roll"
01:14:18;01:14:22;"revival kind of fun nostalgia event"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"with some really big names at Madison Square Garden."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Everybody from Bob Dylan, John Lennon were there,"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"some early rock and roll greats."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"And he went on stage and at some point,"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"he got booed by the audience."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"- And do you remember the story, Jake?"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"It's like some people claim that he misunderstood"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"what the booing was for."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"He felt like they were booing him 'cause he was a has-been,"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"they didn't wanna hear him,"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"but really they were booing something else."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"- Yeah, I don't remember that part."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"I remember just having sort of a vague awareness"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"that the show didn't go that well."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"- And he wrote a song about it."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- And then, yeah, he was sort of skeptical"
01:14:56;01:15:00;"of this whole like retro kind of like revival,"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"like rock and roll revival nostalgia act."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"And he's just sort of like,"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"♪ If memories were all I sang ♪"
01:15:06;01:15:09;"♪ I'd rather drive a truck ♪"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"But like the chorus is sort of like,"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"you can't please everyone, so you gotta please yourself."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- Yeah. - That's a good advice."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"It's sort of like, you have to follow your own instinct"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"and your own gut and don't be beholden"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"to other people's opinions."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"- It's like saying you gotta roll with the punches."
01:15:23;01:15:26;"Like there's always gonna be somebody"
01:15:26;01:15:27;"that's got an issue with you."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"There's always gonna be something in life that bothers you"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"and you just gotta keep on trucking."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"- And just like Madison Square Garden,"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"calling it Garden Party."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"- Yeah. - Great."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"- I actually thought of you when I,"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"'cause I actually read about that song somewhat recently."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"I mean, I've loved that song for decades,"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"but somehow I ended up on the,"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"well, I was listening to some Ricky Nelson"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"full-length records from the early '70s,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"which are pretty good."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"And then I ended up on the Garden Party Wikipedia page"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"and I was like, oh, that's so witty."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"And I totally thought of you."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- Oh, really?"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"- I was like someone that would appreciate"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"that sort of like pun."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"- Oh yeah, no, absolutely."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Yeah, it's so funny."
01:16:02;01:16:05;"I really got into that song like sometime in the past year."
01:16:05;01:16:09;"Well, maybe if one day people gather in large groups again"
01:16:09;01:16:12;"for live music and Vampire Weekend plays"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Madison Square Garden again,"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"bring Jake out for a Mountain Brews Garden Party."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"One, two, punch."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"- That'd be sick, man."
01:16:19;01:16:20;"(laughing)"
01:16:20;01:16:21;"That'd be huge."

01:17:05;01:17:08;"and I included a few suggestions that people had."
01:17:08;01:17:09;"- Oh, cool."
01:17:09;01:17:12;"- And I think Garden Party actually was suggested by someone"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"and when I saw that, I was like, oh yeah, that's perfect."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"- I've got to give a shout out to friend of the show,"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Kyle Field, Little Wings."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"- Yeah."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"- 'Cause he's got probably one of his most famous songs"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"is on this list."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"- Yeah."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"- And I feel like, you know, last time he was on the show,"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"we talked a bunch about surfing"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"and we were just kind of shooting the (beep)"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"we didn't talk all that much about his music."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"- Yeah."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- And maybe 'cause we don't want to make him"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"like feel embarrassed, but he, you know,"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"he's kind of a, he's a legend of music"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"and Jake, you've been friends with him"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"and a fan for a long time."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"So maybe you can contextualize"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"and tell us a little bit about one of his signature songs,"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"""Look at What the Light Did Now."""
01:17:49;01:17:53;"- I've been a fan, but also a band member for years."
01:17:53;01:17:53;"- Oh, right. Yeah, yeah."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"- Kyle thinks of the band as sort of,"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"'cause there's a lot of local gigs in SoCal,"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"but he kind of thinks of the band"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"as sort of like a men's softball league."
01:18:01;01:18:04;"It's sort of like, if you can show up and play,"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"I'd love to have you, but if you can't make it, I get it."
01:18:06;01:18:09;"- Practice on Tuesday nights."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"- Little Wings is absolutely no practice ever."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"It's always just like- - No practice ever."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"- Do a little brush up on your own."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"Here's the set list, come to the show."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"- Yeah."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"- ""Look at What the Light Did Now."""
01:18:18;01:18:20;"I mean, I put it on the old wisdom playlist"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"'cause it's like, what's more wise than sort of like"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"taking a second to acknowledge the beauty of the world?"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"A lot of the lyrics of the verses are like"
01:18:29;01:18:32;"pretty trippy, like Kyle lyrics."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"It's not like a super specific story,"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"the way like ""Garden Party"" is."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"- He's having a lot of fun with language."
01:18:37;01:18:39;"Gotta let go of that girly gleaming."
01:18:39;01:18:42;"- ""Taste the taste I taste till it's tasted."""
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- I love that."
01:18:43;01:18:46;"- To me, it's sort of like, when you like step out,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"let's say you're in a Starbucks"
01:18:48;01:18:49;"and then you step out into the parking lot"
01:18:49;01:18:53;"and it's just like, just a beautiful hour of the day"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"and the light is catching the trees"
01:18:54;01:18:57;"and like the light is catching the like windshield"
01:18:57;01:19:01;"of this like SUV in this like really beautiful way."
01:19:01;01:19:03;"- Yeah, really thing about this song,"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"it's interesting 'cause yeah, when you look at it,"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"you hear these verses that are very strange"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"and impressionistic, but he's always alternating"
01:19:10;01:19:11;"with ""Look at What the Light Did Now."""
01:19:11;01:19:12;"- Yeah."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"- And this song, it's like, it's really like a beloved song"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"for like the people who know it."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"It's not just like, oh, that's a cool little wing song."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"It's like people who like know this song,"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"it's often like one of their favorite songs ever."
01:19:22;01:19:25;"I've been to a wedding where this was performed by,"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I think Feist was at the wedding."
01:19:27;01:19:30;"I think she sang it at the wedding during the ceremony."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"- Oh, wow."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"- And she, so Feist has a well-known cover."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"There's another cover that Flo Morrissey"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"and Matthew E. White."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"- Oh yeah."
01:19:38;01:19:41;"- That's a more recent cover, ""Racking Up Some Streams."""
01:19:41;01:19:42;"And it's interesting because yeah,"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"you pull out some of these lines"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"and they're interesting language,"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"but it's hard to know what to make of it."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"And it's not a song that's straightforwardly about like,"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"you know, the songs like a lot, you know,"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"a lot of our favorite songs of all time"
01:19:55;01:19:58;"often are about like the ones that really cut to the core"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"of what it means to be a human being"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"tend to be about like heartbreak or something."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"But this is, it's, yeah, it's very zen."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"It's very haiku-esque."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"There's no one line that's like a perfect yearbook quote"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"that's just like, man, see, this is what life is all about."
01:20:12;01:20:15;"But taken as a whole, I love your interpretation"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"that it is just kind of like pausing"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"for these like beautiful ephemeral moments of life"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"and kind of realizing like, sometimes that's all it is."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"- Yeah."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- There's not always a grand narrative"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"and sometimes you're in a weird mood"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"or you're in pain or something."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"And then sometimes life is just,"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"the meaning of life can feel as simple as just like,"
01:20:33;01:20:36;"oh, oh yeah, look at that little thing,"
01:20:36;01:20:37;"the light bouncing or something."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"So I definitely think it's a very appropriate choice"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"for the old wisdom playlist."
01:20:42;01:20:45;"- Yeah, and it completely relates to sort of my own art"
01:20:45;01:20:48;"making over the last 20 years too, which is, you know,"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"the core of what I do is basically like"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"just beautiful daylight against the facade"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"of like a Toys R Us or something."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"- Right, I mean, for a painter, it's all about light."
01:20:58;01:21:00;"Yeah, you think about light in a way that"
01:21:00;01:21:04;"we all care about light, but you have a whole like language"
01:21:04;01:21:08;"and you have to really analyze light for your work."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"I think it's like the most beautiful thing you can do"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"in art, the people that have done it really well"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"over the millennia are my favorite."
01:21:17;01:21:20;"So, you know, anyway, so that song was always had"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"a real kind of personal connection for me."
01:21:22;01:21:26;"- It's also a great quarantine song because it's like,"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"obviously we're comparing it to like a Zen way of thinking,"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"but a lot of us who maybe, you know,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"don't like this idea of being stuck somewhere"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"because there's nothing to do here"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"and I'm missing something else."
01:21:38;01:21:41;"You know, obviously there's a lot of meditative practices"
01:21:41;01:21:42;"that are kind of about like,"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"man, everything you need is inside."
01:21:44;01:21:47;"Like you can go real deep without going anywhere."
01:21:47;01:21:51;"And in a way thinking about like these small things"
01:21:51;01:21:54;"that might be happening in an apartment or a house"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"or a backyard or through a window,"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"if you don't have a backyard,"
01:21:57;01:22:00;"that literally are just like these little small things"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"with like light and these tiny things that on a day"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"when you have to go all over the city"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"or all over drive somewhere,"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"you wouldn't think about these small things that happen"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"over the course of a day through a window."
01:22:11;01:22:15;"So it's also really good, just like stuck in one place song,"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"'cause there's not that much to do."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"You might as well look at what the light did now."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"♪ Hair like a pounce upon a pico ♪"
01:22:22;01:22:25;"♪ Look at what the light did now ♪"
01:22:25;01:22:28;"♪ Barret like a bounce upon the beco ♪"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"♪ Look at what the light did now ♪"
01:22:31;01:22:34;"♪ Land and water and bird or beast ♪"
01:22:34;01:22:37;"♪ Oh, look at what the light did now ♪"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"♪ Shiny little band or golden fleece ♪"

01:22:53;01:23:08;"- Great song and also shout out to Kyle"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"who made it onto From the Freezer,"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"which I'm sure most TC heads know about."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"From the Freezer is a great Instagram account"
01:23:16;01:23:21;"that showcases a lot of fan made bootleg T-shirts"
01:23:21;01:23:24;"and art objects and things like that"
01:23:24;01:23:28;"related to time crisis, Vampire Weekend, Jake, Mountain Brews."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"And there's these great pictures that Kyle took,"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"or somebody took of Kyle wearing"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"the Mountain Brews long sleeve shirt"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"that's in the style of the Patagonia logo,"
01:23:38;01:23:41;"which I think From the Freezer actually made himself."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"And I was like, that's definitely one of the"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"best things I've seen."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"I love seeing Kyle."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"It looks great on him."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Everything about it is perfect."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"Well, anyway, everybody check out the Old Wisdom playlist."
01:23:52;01:23:55;"It's on Apple Music and Seinfeld,"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"you'll get this to the people."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"- Yes."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"- Thanks Seinfeld."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"Seinfeld's diligently crunching numbers."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"He's got himself on mute for most of the show."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"We appreciate that."
01:24:04;01:24:06;"So now we're gonna have a little check in"
01:24:06;01:24:09;"with another friend of the show, Kazzy David."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"Seinfeld, you've been in touch with Kazzy much lately?"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"- Not a whole lot, just reached out to her"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"to invite her on the show."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"But she wrote something recently about being a germaphobe."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"It seems very apropos."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"- So she's been a long time germaphobe."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"All right, let's get her on the horn."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"- Now let's go to the time crisis hotline."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"(phone ringing)"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"- Yo."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"- Friend of the show, Kazzy David."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Welcome back. - What's up?"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"- So Kazzy, how long have you been quarantined"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"and are you taking it seriously?"
01:24:42;01:24:46;"- So I started quarantining a week earlier"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"than everyone else really did"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"'cause I wanted to stay with my dad."
01:24:51;01:24:55;"So had to start early, you know, just in case"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"if I went over the line, would never be able to see him again"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"you know what I mean?"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"- Right."
01:25:00;01:25:04;"- And I've been here for about 17 days."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"- And it's just the two of you?"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"- It's me, him and his girlfriend."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Okay, three people."
01:25:09;01:25:10;"- Yeah, it's three of us."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"But I am, let's just say I'm doing"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"most of the household chores."
01:25:15;01:25:18;"- Well, somebody's gotta be the team leader."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- Exactly."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"- And are you ordering in food much?"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"- We're trying not to at all."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"We did it once."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"But you know, you have to disinfect the containers."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"It's a whole thing."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"- It's a whole thing."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"But Kazzy, you wrote something recently"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"about how you're an OG germaphobe."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"Have you always been like a hardcore hand washer?"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"- Yeah."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"- Pureller?"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"- I stayed away from Purell, you know,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"but I always remember everything I've touched."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"I never touched door handles,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"never touch anything that other people have touched."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"And if I do, immediately remember until I get to the sink"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"and then I can forget about it."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"But yeah, it just seemed like, you know,"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"everyone just like hopped on board my train."
01:26:00;01:26:04;"That was, you know, we've been doing this forever."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"- I know some serious germaphobes"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"who feel like the world finally caught up to them."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"- Yeah."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"- I know a decent amount of people who always were like,"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"it's annoying, you got to spend this extra money on wipes,"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"but every time you fly, wipe down your seat, wipe down."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"And it'd always be like, really?"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"And they'd be like,"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"there's so many people coming in and out of those,"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"they don't have time to clean the planes in between."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And some people always do that."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"And it definitely felt for a long time"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"was considered very extra to be the person."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"- Oh my God, the plane, of course."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"I would have loved to wear a mask to an airport."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"Like to wear gloves to an airport, I mean, I wish,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"but I also have deep shame."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"So it's either one or the other, you know?"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Do you have any advice for people?"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"'Cause I found this like,"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"washing my hands so much these days,"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"my wrists are all messed up."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Yeah, they're like all like kind of red and like,"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"what's good for that?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"- I've been putting aquaphor, yep."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- I never used to be somebody who like,"
01:26:58;01:27:02;"like I was very annoyed when I'd go into a bathroom"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"at like a fancy restaurant or hotel,"
01:27:04;01:27:08;"where they would have the soap"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"right next to the hand cream by the sink."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"Have you guys ever had this experience"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"that you're at like a bougie place that has hand cream,"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"the water's running and you put this on your hands"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"and you're like, oh, this is hand cream."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"Obviously there's nothing disgusting about hand cream,"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"but it feels a little bit gross when you're expecting soap."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"And then you got to double up on the soap."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"But anyway, now I kind of realize, yeah,"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"like your hands and your wrists"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"can get dried out like crazy."
01:27:31;01:27:34;"- I took out the garbage today and I was so freaked out"
01:27:34;01:27:37;"that I washed my hands with a dish washing soap,"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"like palm olive."
01:27:38;01:27:43;"And it like burned off the outer layer of my skin"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"on my hands, it was so rough."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"- I thought palm olive was--"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"- Something's gonna happen to human evolution,"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"like with all this."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"- No, seriously."
01:27:49;01:27:52;"Not only are you throwing this new virus at humanity,"
01:27:52;01:27:55;"you're throwing a whole new set of protocols"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"at people who normally don't do it."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"There's gonna be all sorts of weird, unexpected things."
01:27:58;01:28:02;"But Seinfeld, I thought palm olive used to be marketed"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"in like the '50s to housewives and being like,"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"and it makes your hands feel amazing."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Didn't there used to be like women's hands"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"on the labels of palm olive?"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"- I think there still are ladies' hands"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"on the palm olive bottle."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"Oh no, no, it's a woman's hand holding a glass,"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"but it still harkens back."
01:28:17;01:28:21;"- Is the hand look attractive or is it kind of red"
01:28:21;01:28:24;"and bleeding and looks like it's been dipped in acid?"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"- There's like a bone sticking out of one of the digits."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"- It's like a zombie hand."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"- No, it's a zombie hand."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"No, it's like a beautiful, it's a beautiful hand."
01:28:33;01:28:37;"- You're saying that a dish soap that's marketed"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"literally on the label has a beautiful woman's hand"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"holding a glass."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"For you, it burned your hands."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"- That's correct."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"And actually I'm zooming in here on the bottle"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"and it says tough on grease, soft on hands."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"I think that's false advertising."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"Maybe you bought their April Fool's Day edition"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"hit shelves a week early."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"That's tough on hands, soft on grease."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"- It's just pure acid."
01:29:02;01:29:05;"- So Kazzy, as a germaphobe, I got to ask,"
01:29:05;01:29:08;"'cause we were discussing earlier that for me,"
01:29:08;01:29:11;"what I find stressful is not being at home."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I'm stressed out for the fate of humanity,"
01:29:13;01:29:17;"for all the people worrying about money and their jobs"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"and getting sick."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"That stuff really stresses me out."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"But being stuck at home, it's just-"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"- Who gives a (beep)"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"- I mean, look, if somebody's like,"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"I hate being stuck at home because I'm stuck with somebody,"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"I got a real problem with,"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"obviously that's a different category,"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"but yeah, just the idea of being stuck in one place-"
01:29:32;01:29:35;"- I'm talking about the people who are giving suggestions"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"for what we should be doing with our time, like online."
01:29:38;01:29:43;"Like watch movies, read a book, FaceTime with your friends."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"Obviously, what?"
01:29:46;01:29:50;"- Yeah, well, to me, it's not even about not being bored."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"It's like, the real question is,"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"what are things you can do to not be stressed?"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"- Right."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"- Because it's a stressful time."
01:29:56;01:30:00;"And yeah, if you spend all day reading the news,"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"especially via social media,"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"you might be a little bit harshed out."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"But so I guess for you,"
01:30:04;01:30:08;"does being kind of like a homebody and a germaphobe"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"go hand in hand?"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"- Listen, always been a homebody,"
01:30:11;01:30:14;"always been a germaphobe, always been anxious."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"This is just like a day, you know?"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"There's nothing."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"My lifestyle really hasn't changed"
01:30:18;01:30:22;"besides being more stressed for the fate of humanity"
01:30:22;01:30:26;"and everyone who's in so much worse off positions, you know?"
01:30:26;01:30:31;"But otherwise it's like, yeah, just like welcome chaos of-"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"- For you, it's not personal stress"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"because you're already been a germaphobe and homebody."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"It's stress for everybody else."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"- Yeah, that's how I feel."
01:30:39;01:30:42;"- Do you guys struggle with a pressure"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"to feel quote productive?"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"- You know, I think I'm also lucky on that front"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"because I always have the same feeling"
01:30:50;01:30:53;"because as a musician and a songwriter,"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"there's always this feeling of like,"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"well, I could be like writing some lyrics right now."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"I could be like listening to music as research."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"So basically I feel like the low level stress"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"that I have constantly at any given moment being like,"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"what's the next album gonna sound like?"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Which old demos do I have?"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Do I think have legs?"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"That never goes away."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"So I feel the exact same that I would have felt"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"one month ago, six months ago, three years ago."
01:31:16;01:31:19;"If anything, I'm probably pretty soon,"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"right now I feel the same as I always do."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Pretty soon I think I'll probably start to be like,"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"you know, I think a lot of people already feel this way."
01:31:25;01:31:28;"Things that seemed important a month ago, a year ago,"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"seem less important now."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"So I have to imagine that."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"- It also feels like every person's productivity level"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"has been put to a halt, you know?"
01:31:36;01:31:40;"So we're like people who have always worked at home"
01:31:40;01:31:43;"or like written or whatever are kind of fast forwarding"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"through while everyone else is, you know,"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"furthering their careers."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"Everyone's kind of been put to a stop right now."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"And then everyone who writes and you know,"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"is a songwriter, does something like that,"
01:31:55;01:31:59;"gets to continue on with what they would normally do."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"Do you feel like that at all?"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"- I think I'll still get my little ideas here and there"
01:32:02;01:32:05;"and just like on any day I'll go work on a little bit,"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"but I definitely feel to some extent like,"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"for better or for worse,"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"when I think about the album format"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"and to some extent the song format,"
01:32:13;01:32:17;"I feel like it's like a snapshot of a moment in time."
01:32:17;01:32:21;"And we're all taking in so much information right now"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"that I kind of feel like,"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"yeah, maybe scribble down little ideas,"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"but I think in the future I'll have a better idea"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"of like what to do with it."
01:32:28;01:32:31;"This kind of seems like a time to like chill,"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"think, observe."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"There's something like pretty funny to me about like,"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"you know, we know that whatever happens,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"there will be a better time than right now."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"Whether it's sooner than we hope,"
01:32:41;01:32:42;"whether it's later than we hope,"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"we know there'll be a better time than right now."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"And at that time we'll want just like funny,"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"lightweight comedy."
01:32:49;01:32:52;"And we'll want like feel good songs"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"about like going down to Dino's Bar and Grill"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"or some (beep) like that."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"But the idea of like sitting down"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"to like write them right now,"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"which seems like kind of hilarious,"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"just being like, you know, a year from now,"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"people just want some feel good (beep)"
01:33:04;01:33:08;"so like I'm gonna work on a song that's like about like,"
01:33:08;01:33:09;"you know, really about like part,"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"high five and everybody at the bar,"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"you know, like, I think it's okay to just chill and observe."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"And if you get ideas, cool."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"- But the amount of quarantine content"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"that have come out in the last two weeks."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"- Oh my God."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"- It's like a race."
01:33:21;01:33:26;"I mean, everyone has already an Instagram live show."
01:33:26;01:33:29;"They're making quarantine songs."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"I just think it's, well, yeah, exactly."
01:33:31;01:33:35;"I do think it is a time to chill and not be,"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"I don't know, it kind of is overwhelming"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"the amount of stuff that we're,"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"that are being thrown out, like the podcast and the."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"- Internet radio shows."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"- Internet radio shows."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Well, I'll tell you one thing I like about this show"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"is that no disrespect to the TC heads,"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"'cause we do care about you"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"and we hope that this show brings you some joy"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"and sense of community when you listen to it."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"But even before it goes out to you,"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"just us recording it, it's kind of just,"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"this has always been the case with ""Time Crisis""."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"When we just hang out and talk,"
01:34:04;01:34:07;"I do kind of stop thinking too much about like"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"some of the mundane problems of life."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"'Cause you're just like hanging out."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"We're hanging out, just enjoying each other's company."
01:34:12;01:34:16;"So even if after we recorded this,"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"the producers dragged the session to the trash can."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"- We're gonna take out the garbage."
01:34:20;01:34:21;"- Come say it, come say it."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"- We're gonna take out the garbage."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"What happened?"
01:34:24;01:34:24;"- Come here."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"- Huh?"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"What's that?"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"Your glasses are on the floor."
01:34:28;01:34:28;"- Okay, all right."
01:34:28;01:34:29;"- I stepped on them."
01:34:29;01:34:32;"- All right, we have a special, special guest."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"- Who are these people?"
01:34:33;01:34:34;"- Hey."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- Hey, how are you doing?"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"- Can you see me?"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"- Yeah, this is ""Time Crisis""."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"This is a, don't worry, it's not live."
01:34:40;01:34:44;"This is an internet radio show that's gonna air on Sunday."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"- Who's talking now?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Which one?"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"- This is him, that's, he's talking now."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"- Oh, okay."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"- This is Ezra."
01:34:50;01:34:53;"We were just talking to Kazzy about being ahead of the curve"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"as a germaphobe in the pre-corona times."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"I couldn't help but think actually,"
01:34:57;01:35:01;"watching this season of ""Curb"" with the Purell on the table,"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"you also were a bit ahead of the curve."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"- Yeah, just a bit, right?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I know, a lot of people have mentioned that to me."
01:35:07;01:35:10;"- Purell's become like a symbol of the era."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"- You know what's really funny is,"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"I'm sure people have said this to you too,"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"a lot of people cooped up at their houses,"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"were watching old movies, old TV shows."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Like I was telling them,"
01:35:21;01:35:22;"I'd just been watching ""The Apartment"","
01:35:22;01:35:24;"the Billy Wilder movie,"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"where Jack Lemmon has like a cold through the whole thing."
01:35:26;01:35:28;"And you watch it and this time,"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"and he's going to work with his cold"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"and everybody's shaking hands and it's like disgusting."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"It looks like, you're like,"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"what is this savagery I'm watching?"
01:35:35;01:35:38;"And then the only thing that in these quarantine times"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"that actually seemed like correct"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"was ""Curb"" with the Purell on the table."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"Everything else seems nasty."
01:35:44;01:35:48;"- Well, I've been talking about it shaking for a long time,"
01:35:48;01:35:49;"how wrong that is."
01:35:49;01:35:52;"There was a time when I was grabbing people's elbows."
01:35:52;01:35:55;"I thought the fist bump was a good new development."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"There's just,"
01:35:56;01:36:01;"you know, there's too much contact between people,"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"even sex, it's enough."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"People gotta do something about the sex."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"It's not cool."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"- How early were you anti-sex?"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"- How early were you anti-handshake?"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"Like, are we talking like 90s or even like-"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"- Yeah, 90s, yes, for sure, yeah."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"- People have a real, well, this is one thing."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"This is a huge game changer 'cause-"
01:36:21;01:36:21;"- This is Ezra."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"- Ezra, okay."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"How come you're the only one doing the talking?"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"What are the other people doing?"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"- You know, this is really, it's a delicate balance."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"So, you know, it takes a while to hear."
01:36:31;01:36:34;"And then you have to wait for it to be, you know,"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"everyone, everyone-"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"- What's your last name, Ezra?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"- Koenig."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"- K-O-E-N-I-G?"
01:36:41;01:36:42;"- Yeah."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"- There was a shortstop on the 1927 Yankees"
01:36:44;01:36:45;"named Mark Koenig."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Are you a relation?"
01:36:46;01:36:50;"- You know, my family's from the Bronx,"
01:36:50;01:36:51;"but I think I would have heard"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"if somebody was on the Yankees."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"So probably not."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"- Could be, 1927, look it up."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"- Yeah, but no, you're right."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"I am doing most of the talking."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I should also introduce you to my co-host,"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"Jake Longstreth."
01:37:01;01:37:01;"- Hey, Larry."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"- He's an American painter."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"And then you probably heard of Seinfeld 2000,"
01:37:07;01:37:08;"as Kazi explained."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"Seinfeld 2000."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"- Yes, yes, I've heard of it."
01:37:12;01:37:16;"It's updated for texting and things like that, right?"
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- No, no, he's the good one."
01:37:17;01:37:21;"- Yeah, there's some bad ones, for sure."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"- Okay."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Well, it was nice to meet you guys."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"- Yeah, you too."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"- Great to meet you."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"- Okay."
01:37:28;01:37:31;"(laughing)"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"All right."
01:37:32;01:37:36;"I'm a real teen right now, you guys."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"- So he just came into your bedroom"
01:37:37;01:37:38;"just to see what was going on?"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"- He loves a pop-in,"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"especially from the hours of eight to 10."
01:37:42;01:37:45;"- Are you guys doing any kind of set,"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"not for creativity or anything like that,"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"but any kind of set schedule things"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"just for the order of the household?"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Are you guys doing,"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"let's all sit down for lunch or dinner,"
01:37:54;01:37:55;"is there anything like that?"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"- We always have dinner together."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"I forgot about this,"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"'cause I haven't lived here in so long,"
01:38:00;01:38:03;"but his disposition is really surprising."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"He's always in a good mood."
01:38:05;01:38:09;"He always is a great greeter in the morning."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"And I'm a teenager,"
01:38:10;01:38:14;"I'm always moody, walking around, moping around."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"But it is surprising,"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"he's just always in a good mood,"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"really excited for the next day."
01:38:20;01:38:21;"- Well, that's great."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"I mean, and also, famously,"
01:38:22;01:38:27;"people revert to their child or teen vibes"
01:38:27;01:38:32;"when they're in the same house as their parents."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"Do you feel like you become more of a moody teen?"
01:38:34;01:38:37;"- That's just my permanent state of being, I think."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"So no for me."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"- Oh, forever a moody teen."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"Well, what do you got lined up for the rest of the week?"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Doing any more internet radio shows?"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"(laughing)"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"- My favorite thing I've been doing"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"is watching the excuses of"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"how people are posting photos right now"
01:38:54;01:38:57;"and what excuses they're using to post"
01:38:57;01:39:01;"and how that's gonna change and evolve"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"over the next few-- - Oh, that's interesting"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"because I found like-- - Wait, what do you mean?"
01:39:03;01:39:07;"- So everyone's always desperate to post Instagrams, right?"
01:39:07;01:39:08;"- So desperate."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"- Of course."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"So right before corona hit,"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"everyone was getting their last post in"
01:39:12;01:39:15;"knowing that they weren't allowed to post during corona"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"and it was probably gonna be their last time ever."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Now you're seeing a lot of,"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"""Miss these times with my friends."
01:39:21;01:39:25;"If you guys social distance soon, we can do this again."""
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Stuff like that."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"You know what I'm talking about?"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"- Yeah, the posts that are kind of like,"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"""Oh, remember when we did all this?"
01:39:30;01:39:30;"Miss you guys."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"Can't wait to see you."""
01:39:31;01:39:32;"That kind of thing. - Yeah."
01:39:32;01:39:36;"We'll be able to do this under the guise of"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"alerting the public, helping people."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"- Yeah."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"- So it's just interesting to watch that happen,"
01:39:41;01:39:44;"watch all these celebrities kind of unravel"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"and that's kind of what I'm doing with my time."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Just watching it all now. - Yeah, no."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Absolutely."
01:39:49;01:39:53;"I think this is a great time to just observe."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"Observe and report."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"- Totally."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"(laughing)"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"- And totally with the celebrities thing too,"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"is like, it's only gonna get weirder,"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"but I've had the thought seeing one or two"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"kind of strange celebrity things."
01:40:07;01:40:11;"It is a very strange time when"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"everybody is just on their phones."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"So it is a little bit like--"
01:40:16;01:40:19;"We're all civilians now."
01:40:19;01:40:22;"There's no going out and getting your photo taken"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"and being in outfits."
01:40:24;01:40:27;"Everyone's just a person."
01:40:27;01:40:31;"I've noticed that it's started to drive some people crazy."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"- You know what, guys?"
01:40:32;01:40:35;"We used to joke to some extent about how"
01:40:35;01:40:39;"this isn't a podcast and it being an internet radio show"
01:40:39;01:40:42;"made it a very ethical form of content."
01:40:42;01:40:45;"But it especially feels that way now."
01:40:45;01:40:45;"I don't know why."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"(laughing)"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"- It feels like we're FaceTiming."
01:40:48;01:40:50;"- Well, I'm glad that when your dad came in"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"and was like, ""What the hell is this?"""
01:40:51;01:40:53;"that we could say, ""It's an internet radio show, sir."""
01:40:53;01:40:56;"(laughing)"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"I feel like if we had been like, ""It's a podcast,"""
01:40:58;01:41:00;"he would've been like, ""Ah!"""
01:41:00;01:41:02;"- It really did make it feel like a..."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"Like a student."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"- No, but I like that it was an internet radio show,"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"but it's not live."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"It's a pre-recorded internet radio."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"Also, it's--"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"- It's very confusing."
01:41:13;01:41:14;"- It's for school."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"This has never happened on ""Time Crisis"""
01:41:16;01:41:18;"that somebody came into their daughter's bedroom"
01:41:18;01:41:22;"and said, ""What are you talking to?"""
01:41:22;01:41:24;"We could say proudly, ""Sir, this is a pre-recorded"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"""internet radio show on Apple."""
01:41:27;01:41:32;"All right, well, we'll check in with you again soon."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"- Okay, thank you guys."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"- Keep observing and reporting."
01:41:35;01:41:36;"- Absolutely."
01:41:36;01:41:36;"- Bye, Kazzy."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"- Thanks so much."

01:43:02;01:43:03;"Friend of the show, Kazzy David,"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"an unexpected Larry David pop in,"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"but that's just what happens in these quarantine times."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"You never know who you're gonna get."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"We got one more call to check in"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"and it's friend of the show, Tim Heidecker."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"So why don't we get Tim on the horn?"
01:43:16;01:43:19;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:43:19;01:43:22;"(phone ringing)"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"- Yo."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- Tim, welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:43:26;01:43:29;"- Thank you for having me."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"- Good to have you back, man."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"- Good to be back."
01:43:31;01:43:35;"- So Tim, I wanna get first the headline,"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"your new show, Beef House."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"You pulled some strings to get it bumped up,"
01:43:38;01:43:41;"which I really appreciate as a fan"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"and a quarantined person."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"You got pulled some strings to get Adult Swim"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"to bump up your and Eric's new show to be streaming now."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"When was it gonna stream originally?"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"- This Sunday."
01:43:52;01:43:55;"So we put it out like a week ahead of time,"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"which I feel like was not, you know,"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"we tried to do it earlier,"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"like sort of that first week"
01:44:01;01:44:04;"when stuff started going downhill."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"But now I feel like all we did"
01:44:06;01:44:10;"was give people like a hit of heroin."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"And now they have to wait."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"- Oh, now we gotta wait even longer."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"- Now they have to wait two weeks."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"We didn't put the whole thing out."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"We just put one episode out"
01:44:17;01:44:20;"and now it's gonna be two weeks before the next one."
01:44:20;01:44:23;"You know, so it's a bit of a lateral move, but."
01:44:23;01:44:27;"- Well, I appreciate it."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"I've watched it a few times. - Did you enjoy it?"
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- Oh, I loved it."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"I watched it three times."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Well, you know, it's a short episode."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"One thing that I was thinking,"
01:44:35;01:44:36;"which was very strange."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"I don't know if this crossed your mind,"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"if anybody said it to you."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"In the first episode of ""Beef House,"""
01:44:41;01:44:44;"it opens with, it takes place in a beef house"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"and it opens with an Easter parade."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"And the whole thing is about how much you guys,"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"and especially Eric's character, loves Easter."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"And it's such an important holiday to him."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"And then, so I watched it a few times"
01:44:56;01:45:00;"and then a day or two later, Trump gets up there"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"and is like, ""We need to open America by Easter."""
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Easter is a very important holiday to me."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"And I was like- - I know."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"I can't believe, like, there's been a few of these things"
01:45:09;01:45:13;"in my recent work that keeps strangely,"
01:45:13;01:45:18;"coincidentally predicting the future, or we do stuff."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"You know, obviously we shot that in the fall."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"And yeah, there's no way you know."
01:45:24;01:45:27;"I mean, I guess it makes sense that our idiot"
01:45:27;01:45:30;"is gonna say something dumb like that, but-"
01:45:30;01:45:33;"- But the idea of being really into Easter,"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"it's already such a funny thing to be really into Easter"
01:45:35;01:45:38;"because as far as the famous Christian holidays go,"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"I think 99% of people's favorite holiday is Christmas."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"It just towers above them."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"So the idea of just being super hyped on Easter"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"is already strange."
01:45:47;01:45:51;"- As a lapsed Catholic, as I am,"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"Easter is actually the most,"
01:45:53;01:45:56;"the holiest of holidays for the Catholics."
01:45:56;01:45:59;"- As far as the real religious importance goes."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"- The religious side of it, the resurrection,"
01:46:01;01:46:05;"the birth is not as big a deal."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"You have to have them both, I guess,"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"for the whole thing to work."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"But for some reason, as a kid,"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"Easter was the most important religious holiday."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"- It's the conclusion."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"It's the Avengers ending."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"- It's the fulfillment of the prophecy, big time."
01:46:18;01:46:19;"- Yeah, when you put it that way,"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"maybe this is less of a Catholic thing,"
01:46:21;01:46:25;"but the idea that this kind of epic resolution"
01:46:25;01:46:30;"of the story of the son of God coming back from the dead"
01:46:30;01:46:34;"is somehow became the pastel holiday is so bizarre."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"- Well, it's spring."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"I mean, it's renewal."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"It's all pagan."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"It's all coming from pagan traditions."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"I mean, the chocolates is garbage."
01:46:44;01:46:47;"If you ask my six-year-old what her favorite holidays are,"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"it's Halloween 'cause of candy,"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"then Christmas because of presents,"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"and then Easter because of candy."
01:46:53;01:46:57;"There's no other real association besides candy."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"- So as a father with young children"
01:46:59;01:47:02;"who obviously are gonna be very excited for Easter,"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"is it difficult getting supplies?"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Do you have enough peeps and things like that?"
01:47:05;01:47:08;"- You know, we're gonna, we have not."
01:47:08;01:47:12;"We have much more pressing issues at the moment."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"We have not stocked up on Easter."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Although we did like sort of a,"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"we were cleaning out a closet"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"and we had all the Easter, the plastic Easter eggs."
01:47:19;01:47:22;"So we did kind of a dry run of an Easter egg hunt"
01:47:22;01:47:27;"in the house, which took up about 25 minutes of time,"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"which was, you know,"
01:47:28;01:47:31;"we're trying to just fill the hours here."
01:47:31;01:47:31;"I mean, I don't know how much"
01:47:31;01:47:34;"of this quarantine business you wanna talk about,"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"but it's all about filling the hours."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"- Well, actually, I do have this question."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Like, how old are your kids?"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"- Three and six, but one is in first grade."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"The other one is in preschool."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"- That seems very hard core to have."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"Like, well, the one who's in first grade,"
01:47:47;01:47:51;"are they video conferencing their teachers and stuff?"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"- Not yet."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"That should start next week."
01:47:54;01:47:57;"This is so boring, but we were on spring break for,"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"they were on spring break in Glendale"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"and they extended the spring break a week"
01:48:02;01:48:05;"so that they could figure out what the hell to do."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"But this morning, I mean, listen, I love my kids,"
01:48:07;01:48:11;"but I was like, you know, my wife is busy with her stuff"
01:48:11;01:48:14;"and I've got a lot of stuff to try to keep going,"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"keep balls in the air."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"I'm like, I'll do the kids all morning."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"I'll do them like all, you don't have to think about them."
01:48:19;01:48:22;"I'm just gonna be with the kids all day"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"until like, you know, lunchtime."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"And it's hard, man."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"I was in a tent with them."
01:48:28;01:48:32;"We put a tent up in our front yard and it's like, you know,"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"you just kind of run out of stuff to do."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"And I was really exhausted."
01:48:36;01:48:39;"I was, and I'm just, you know, kind of depressed too."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"So it was just kind of like, I don't know, man,"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"what are we doing, camping now?"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"Camping in our front yard?"
01:48:44;01:48:47;"- Were you just like, I'm not into this, guys."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"- I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play this."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"There's all sorts of rules."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"I had to listen to how grim it got."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"According to my daughter, we had to get married."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"You know, she said, listen, what if you were not my dad,"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"but we were in love and we had to get married"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"and this whole scenario that she invents."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"And then I become the husband to her."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"It becomes a whole thing in her head"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"that I've got to play along with."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- It's crossed my mind where I was thinking about people"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"with kids your age, where I'm like,"
01:49:14;01:49:17;"to have a kid where you gotta worry about school issues"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"or where the kid is asking you questions about like,"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"wait, so I really can't go see my friends?"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"Wait, when's school gonna start?"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Like, that must be this whole other thing."
01:49:25;01:49:28;"- My kids are so great and I had like,"
01:49:28;01:49:29;"because I was a little like,"
01:49:29;01:49:33;"my attitude wasn't probably as chipper as it could be."
01:49:33;01:49:36;"So tonight when they're going to bed, I was like,"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"are you okay with not seeing your friends?"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"I know it's hard."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"And I tried to have like a little chat with them,"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"but they were just like, it's fine."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"We're having a great time."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"Like, they're very chill."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"And they're like, we could call."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"My daughter was like, I could call my friends if I want."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"I'm fine."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"She wanted me to like, not worry about it, which was nice."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"- Yeah."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"- It's so easy and good and sweet."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"And I'm not, I'm very lucky."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"And I hate complaining about it, especially to you guys."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- No, that's good to hear."
01:50:02;01:50:06;"But, but so you mentioned that you were feeling depressed."
01:50:06;01:50:09;"Is it just because of the state of the world?"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"- Today was tough."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"I just, you know, I don't know how you sleep."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Do you sleep well?"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"- I've been sleeping okay."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"I started to worry about reading the news"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"too close to bedtime."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"Like I had one or two nights where I was like,"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"something bouncing around in your head,"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"some real dark article."
01:50:24;01:50:25;"- Sure."
01:50:25;01:50:26;"I sleep pretty good in general,"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"but last night I was up at like four"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"and I couldn't go back to sleep."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"So I kind of got up and was like doing some work."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"And it was just one of those days where by the time"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"everyone else got up, I had already kind of lived"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"like a half a day, you know?"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"- Right."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"- And if you want to get real boring,"
01:50:43;01:50:48;"I'd had terrible internet issues the past three days"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"at my house."
01:50:49;01:50:49;"- Oh God."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"- And I'm trying to do this."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"- That's deeply stressful in this moment."
01:50:53;01:50:56;"- The third cable guy came over today,"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"which was already stressful because I'm like,"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"should you be coming to my house?"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"The first thing he said to me was they needed to bring"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"a different kind of technician to the house."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"This is the third visit."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"And I nearly, I swear to God, I nearly started crying."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"I was like, I got choked up."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"I was like, I don't know what to do anymore."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"I'm sorry, I need your help."
01:51:17;01:51:18;"I need you to help me."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"My job requires me to be on the internet."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"And you know, I'm just trying to,"
01:51:24;01:51:28;"like I'm trying to do my office hours podcast from my house."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"- Right, yeah, so one thing,"
01:51:29;01:51:33;"I caught one of your live streams the other day"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"and had some people send me messages about"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"certain Vampire Weekend songs or the last album"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"and hitting a little different in the context of this."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"There's definitely a few songs on the last record"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"that reference staying inside and not going outside"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"and people referencing Harmony Hall a bunch."
01:51:49;01:51:53;"But I can't think of a song that seems more on the nose"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"to reference this than your song,"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"which you were performing, Work From Home."
01:51:57;01:52:00;"The crazy thing about it is other people have some songs"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"about working from home,"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"but there's something about the fact that you're just saying,"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"I'm gonna stay in bed, stare at the ceiling"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"and wait for the sickness to just go away."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"There's something about like,"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"when I caught you on the live stream,"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I was like, oh yeah, Work From Home."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"I remember this song."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"This is a good Tim song."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"And then when you hit the part about,"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"and wait for the sickness, I was like,"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"did he change the lyric for like the Corona times"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"or was it always wait for the sickness?"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"- It was all like, you know, hung over,"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"that kind of sickness."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"That's what I was writing about."
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I got a Google alert from Billboard."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"You know, listen, I don't chart like you."
01:52:34;01:52:38;"I don't make, I'm not a big famous rock star"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"with number one records and Grammys,"
01:52:40;01:52:43;"but I got like a Google alert that Billboard was like,"
01:52:43;01:52:47;"this song jumped 60% in the streams category."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"- Oh really?"
01:52:48;01:52:51;"- I think it went from like 25 plays"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"to 35 plays or something."
01:52:53;01:52:55;"- You know how in England,"
01:52:55;01:52:55;"- It was exciting."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"- In England, they always get obsessed at Christmas"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"with what's gonna be number one."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"And there's like, you know,"
01:53:01;01:53:04;"there's actually, there's a whole plot point"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"and people are always like, there's campaigns."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Like let's make this number one."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"I think for the TC community,"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"let's make a campaign to get Tim Heidecker,"
01:53:12;01:53:15;"work from home to be a Corona number one,"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"number one on the Billboard charts."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"- Well, it would be a nice,"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"I mean, you always hear about these stories,"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"don't you?"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"In rock history about like,"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"it was a nothing record, it disappeared."
01:53:25;01:53:29;"And then some DJ played it and it blew up overnight."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"I never really understood how that works,"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"but maybe this will happen."

01:54:24;01:54:28;"or were you naturally kind of winding down for a little bit?"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"- We have a decent amount of stuff booked this year."
01:54:30;01:54:32;"A lot of it's kind of touch and go."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"I mean, it was funny."
01:54:33;01:54:38;"I got a alert from my airline app today"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"that was saying like,"
01:54:39;01:54:42;"""Get ready for your flight to Buenos Aires."""
01:54:42;01:54:45;"I was like, ""Oh, yeah, that's not happening."""
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Yeah, Lollapalooza South America,"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"that was our next big thing,"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"which was starting this weekend."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"And they pulled the plug on that a couple of weeks ago"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"and they rescheduled for later in the year."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Our person was, first of all,"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"we were doing Australia like a couple days after you guys."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- Oh, right, yeah."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"We talked, you got there right when we left."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"- Yeah, this has been a crazy time"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"that we're touring Australia during the fires."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"- Yeah, we're like wondering"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"if those are gonna get canceled."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"And then we come back"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"and do our Tim and Eric tour of the States."
01:55:16;01:55:19;"And we ended on the Saturday"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"before like the Monday"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"where things started getting really canceled."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"The plan was, first of all,"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"if anyone that's listening saw our show,"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"they know that the last bit in our show,"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"20 minute long kind of extended sketch"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"that sort of becomes the finale of the show"
01:55:37;01:55:41;"is literally a sketch about a disease"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"that becomes airborne in the theater"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"that we have to close the exits."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"And literally we say the words like,"
01:55:48;01:55:51;"we have to quarantine, we cannot let anyone leave."
01:55:51;01:55:54;"We've all been exposed to the disease, I swear to God."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"And we wrote this show last year."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"So it wasn't anything connected to this,"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"but, and it really wasn't,"
01:56:00;01:56:01;"people weren't really talking about it"
01:56:01;01:56:04;"until like the last two weeks of the tour."
01:56:04;01:56:08;"And then it became like the second week of the tour,"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"people were like, oh man, I heard about this."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"Like, that's pretty smart, you know?"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"And then the last few shows"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"where people were kind of squirming"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"'cause they were just like, what is this?"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"How are you even talking about this?"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"And then we got done with the last show"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"and you could tell it was like,"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"we got out of this in the nick of time."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Eric and I were supposed to go to New York"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"the next week to do Jimmy Fallon"
01:56:32;01:56:35;"and Stephen Colbert for Beef House."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"And by the third day we were home,"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"Eric was like, I don't think we should go."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"I was like, really?"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"Like, he wrote me, he was like, do you think we should go?"
01:56:44;01:56:47;"I'm like, listen, it's gonna have to get bad"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"for us not to go."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"Like a day after that conversation was like,"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"how could we even imagine going?"
01:56:52;01:56:52;"- I know."
01:56:52;01:56:53;"- You know what I mean?"
01:56:53;01:56:56;"It was so quick and crazy and scary."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"- It was really like waiting for the dam to burst"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"'cause even the week when we were going"
01:57:00;01:57:03;"to this festival in Florida, Okeechobee,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"a few days before we left,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"we're hearing that a festival in Miami had been canceled."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"And we're like, why did they cancel that one"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"and not this one?"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"And then we're from the company being like,"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"well, the other one that's an EDM festival,"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"it's more international crowd."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"And I was kind of like,"
01:57:17;01:57:20;"that's the kind of thing you get the call"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"and you're like, well, yeah, that makes sense."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"And then you stop and you think about it"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"and you're just like,"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"some people coming from all over the country,"
01:57:26;01:57:27;"like, does that really make sense?"
01:57:27;01:57:30;"- There's all these judgment calls being made"
01:57:30;01:57:33;"like by people that maybe aren't that informed."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"- Yeah, very strange times."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"The final time you did the virus bit"
01:57:37;01:57:41;"must have been weird energy."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"- I mean, it still wasn't even that bad,"
01:57:43;01:57:46;"but I did want, like, I think it was in San Francisco"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"or Portland, it was like Portland."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"And it was like that last week"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"before it would not have been,"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"like we ended when it was still funny,"
01:57:52;01:57:55;"but if it would have gone another maybe four days,"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"it would have been not funny."
01:57:57;01:57:59;"It would have been like, we have to rewrite this."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"- Yeah, it's too uncomfortable."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"- It's too uncomfortable."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"But I made one crack where like,"
01:58:04;01:58:09;"there was a joke about the CDC is aware of the situation"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"and they're coming, they're gonna save us."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"And I usually would say,"
01:58:13;01:58:16;"but we're a low priority"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"because of the kind of comedy we do"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"and the kind of people you are."
01:58:19;01:58:21;"I was like, the joke I would say,"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"but one night I just said, the CDC is coming,"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"but we're a low priority"
01:58:24;01:58:26;"'cause they're dealing with something else right now."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"I don't really know what it is."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"And you can feel the room being like,"
01:58:29;01:58:32;"- Right, too real."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"- I don't like this."
01:58:33;01:58:36;"Yeah, I don't like this."
01:58:36;01:58:38;"So, I mean, anyways."
01:58:38;01:58:40;"- One last question."
01:58:40;01:58:40;"- Yeah."
01:58:40;01:58:43;"- While you're quarantined and you got more time,"
01:58:43;01:58:46;"do you think maybe now you'll get into the dead?"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"I saw a picture of you wearing a Grateful Dead t-shirt"
01:58:48;01:58:49;"recently and I was like, I bought Tim's not a pet."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"- I really liked that shirt."
01:58:51;01:58:54;"I bought it at a truck stop on our last tour,"
01:58:54;01:58:55;"the tour before this one."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"And I wear it ironically, I guess as a joke."
01:58:58;01:59:00;"- What do you mean ironically?"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"Just like a little (beep) to the dead heads?"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"- Yeah, just to mess with your heads."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Just to mess with your heads."
01:59:06;01:59:08;"Just to confuse people."
01:59:08;01:59:09;"We played the Warfield, okay?"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"Like two weeks ago, we played the Warfield."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"- Iconic dead venue."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"- One of the dressing rooms says Jerry on it."
01:59:16;01:59:20;"And so I put on, like I searched like,"
01:59:20;01:59:24;"the Grateful Dead Warfield live, you know?"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"And in my dressing room, I played it."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"I was just playing it."
01:59:27;01:59:30;"And there's things that they do that I do,"
01:59:30;01:59:33;"I can enjoy to some degree."
01:59:33;01:59:38;"I just think in general, it's, I can't understand the,"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"I don't, like I've said many times,"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"I don't enjoy the way they sing."
01:59:42;01:59:45;"Listen, everybody can like, I was on Twitter,"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"there's this guy that writes back to me all the time"
01:59:47;01:59:50;"whenever I do say anything musically."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"He goes, you have the worst taste in music."
01:59:52;01:59:57;"You have the most middle-aged, boring, white music tastes."
01:59:57;02:00:00;"And I just go, who cares?"
02:00:00;02:00:04;"Why do you care what kind of music style I have?"
02:00:04;02:00:05;"What does it matter?"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"He's like, you act so middle-aged."
02:00:07;02:00:10;"And I'm like, what the, I'm 44 years old."
02:00:10;02:00:13;"Wouldn't it be weird if I was like, acting like a teenager?"
02:00:13;02:00:16;"I mean, I like Paul Simon, whatever."
02:00:16;02:00:17;"Who gives a (beep)"
02:00:17;02:00:19;"- I wonder what that dude's story is."
02:00:19;02:00:20;"Like, that's-"
02:00:20;02:00:21;"- I really want to, like,"
02:00:21;02:00:23;"I want to have a whole show with this guy."
02:00:23;02:00:25;"I want to talk to him every day, being like,"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"what is it that you want from me?"
02:00:27;02:00:30;"Like, he's like, you should be working on your comedy"
02:00:30;02:00:31;"instead of this music."
02:00:31;02:00:35;"And he's all mad and you're my, how white I am"
02:00:35;02:00:38;"and how boring my music tastes are."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"It's like, who cares?"
02:00:40;02:00:41;"Why would that interest you?"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"What kind of music anyone likes?"
02:00:43;02:00:45;"But I always retweet him and be like,"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"I think I'll start acting like a teenager"
02:00:47;02:00:48;"to make you feel better."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"Like, what are you talking about?"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"- You should ask him to make you a playlist"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"of non-white teenager music."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"- Yeah, I mean, it's just,"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"you know what, it's that,"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"there's a band that people always tell,"
02:01:00;02:01:03;"they go, you should listen to Death Grips, right?"
02:01:03;02:01:04;"That's the music,"
02:01:04;02:01:07;"that's the music when, if you're real,"
02:01:07;02:01:09;"that's the kind of music you like."
02:01:09;02:01:10;"Those people always say that."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"Like, that's advanced stuff."
02:01:12;02:01:13;"That's next level."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"But I can't get into that."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"I like, I put on Paul Simon, Graceland."
02:01:17;02:01:18;"- It's a great record."
02:01:18;02:01:19;"- You know what I am kind of digging?"
02:01:19;02:01:22;"I'm listening to like that mid-70s"
02:01:22;02:01:25;"or early 70s Miles Davis."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"- What, like Bitches Brew and Live Evil?"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"- Yeah, yeah, that one after that,"
02:01:29;02:01:32;"that's on the, what's it called?"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"- On the Corner. - On the Corner."
02:01:33;02:01:36;"- Oh man, when I'm in like dark places"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"and we're in a dark place right now,"
02:01:38;02:01:41;"I like listening to dark music."
02:01:41;02:01:42;"And that to me is dark music."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"Like, it's like scary. - He does this sick (beep)"
02:01:44;02:01:47;"He's like playing through the wah-wah pedal and stuff."
02:01:47;02:01:50;"- I also realized like for me growing up in the 90s,"
02:01:50;02:01:52;"when I started getting into that, those records,"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"I was like, oh, this is the (beep)"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"that the Beastie Boys were obsessed with."
02:01:56;02:01:59;"'Cause I can hear like that weird, noisy,"
02:01:59;02:02:00;"like funky Beastie Boys stuff."
02:02:00;02:02:02;"And you're like, I think I understand"
02:02:02;02:02:03;"what they're referencing."
02:02:03;02:02:04;"And then I heard that (beep)"
02:02:04;02:02:05;"and I was like, all right, this makes sense."
02:02:05;02:02:08;"- Yeah, like before that, before Miles was doing that,"
02:02:08;02:02:09;"it didn't exist."
02:02:09;02:02:12;"But it's like in our culture,"
02:02:12;02:02:15;"it's coming from like, as like through another source."
02:02:15;02:02:18;"It's weird to think that he kind of invented some stuff"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"that we got the second generation of."
02:02:20;02:02:22;"- Absolutely, fascinating man."
02:02:22;02:02:25;"And also he's a cool visual artist."
02:02:25;02:02:27;"- Oh yeah, well, you know."
02:02:27;02:02:30;"- His like drawings and stuff are pretty sick."
02:02:30;02:02:33;"- Yeah, I watched the documentary, which is on Netflix now."
02:02:33;02:02:36;"But yeah, he's a great example of like how to be an artist"
02:02:36;02:02:40;"and how not to be a human, you know?"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"Like just one of these guys that's totally reckless"
02:02:42;02:02:45;"and drug addict and all that kind of stuff."
02:02:45;02:02:45;"- I gotta watch it."
02:02:45;02:02:47;"Actually, I had a buddy who just told me he watched it"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"and he said that there's a part where he went crazy"
02:02:50;02:02:54;"on his wife because she said Rashida's dad was handsome."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"- Oh yeah, that is part of it, yeah."
02:02:56;02:02:58;"- Somebody was like, yo, there's a whole plot point"
02:02:58;02:02:59;"about Quincy and I was like, oh my God,"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"all right, I gotta watch this."
02:03:01;02:03:04;"All right, well, thanks so much for checking in, Tim."
02:03:04;02:03:05;"I hope you do it again."
02:03:05;02:03:06;"- It's great to talk to you guys."
02:03:06;02:03:09;"- We're going weekly now, so a lot more opportunities."
02:03:09;02:03:12;"- Use me as much as you like, I'm around."
02:03:12;02:03:12;"- We appreciate it."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"I'm gonna ask you about fish next time."
02:03:14;02:03:15;"- Sisters."
02:03:15;02:03:16;"(laughing)"
02:03:16;02:03:17;"- All right, have a good one."
02:03:17;02:03:18;"- Take care, bye."
02:03:18;02:03:19;"- Peace, bye."
02:03:19;02:03:22;"Well guys, this is a real star studded TC."
02:03:22;02:03:23;"- Deeply."
02:03:23;02:03:25;"- We'll get back together in a week."
02:03:25;02:03:27;"We didn't really do any fan emails or questions,"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"but please keep them coming 'cause it really,"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"we always read them and it really helps us."
02:03:31;02:03:34;"I'm sure next time we'll probably dig back into the mailbag."
02:03:34;02:03:39;"All right, fellas, thank you to Jake, Seinfeld, Nick,"
02:03:39;02:03:40;"Matt and the whole team."
02:03:40;02:03:43;"And thank you to Tim Heidecker, the David family"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"and Winter with his epic story."
02:03:45;02:03:47;"We'll see you in a week."
02:03:47;02:03:51;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:03:51;02:03:52;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
