00:00;00:06;"Tom Crisis 8, we finally made it."
00:06;00:12;"I'm back in New York, and that means I'm back with Despot and Cousin Asher."
00:12;00:13;"But that's not all."
00:13;00:21;"We'll be joined by legendary actor/writer Jonah Hill, and legendary rapper/singer I"
00:21;00:22;"Love Makonnen."
00:22;00:27;"We'll also be counting down the hits and talking about the surprising connection between"
00:27;00:30;"Adolf Hitler, Drake, and the Taliban."
00:31;00:33;"Time Crisis."
00:33;00:35;"It's located in..."
00:35;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:25;"Leave a lonely man, staring at the ceiling."
01:25;01:32;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:32;01:38;"One of us is lonely, one of us is gone."
01:38;01:48;"All that night, I been..."
01:48;01:50;"With that white light."
01:50;01:54;"All up in the corner, my issue is she's goddamn booming, boy."
01:54;01:58;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy."
01:58;02:02;"All up in the 80s, my issue is still gravy, yeah."
02:02;02:06;"Shout out to your lady, yeah, yeah, she became my lady."
02:06;02:10;"Hit her with the drop top when I hit that highway, boy."
02:10;02:14;"She keeps on on my shit, cost like fireways, boy."
02:14;02:18;"I got a hoe outside, she gon' pull up right now."
02:18;02:22;"And she gon' make it all go down."
02:22;02:26;"All my issues, tell me, nigga, I'm best."
02:26;02:30;"If you ain't know, it's coming from the West."
02:30;02:33;"We gon' kick this shit off in the South."
02:33;02:37;"I'ma turn it up and I'ma, ay, turn it up."
02:37;02:39;"Where your girl at?"
02:39;02:41;"Watch me turn it out."
02:41;02:45;"Like, huh, ay, all in her mouth."
02:45;02:47;"Huh, where your girl at?"
02:47;02:49;"Watch me turn it out."
02:49;02:52;"That was our good friend Olive Maconin with ""Where Your Girl At?"""
02:52;02:54;"This is ""Time Crisis."""
02:54;02:57;"The reason I played that is because I'm back in New York,"
02:57;03:00;"I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy."
03:00;03:04;"And being back in New York and feeling like Patrick Ewing,"
03:04;03:07;"I'm finally joined once again by the original ""Time Crisis"" team."
03:07;03:09;"Cousin Asher, how you doing, man?"
03:09;03:11;"I'm good. How you doing, Ezra? Good to be back."
03:11;03:14;"Good to be back. And Despot, what's up, dude?"
03:14;03:16;"Hi, man. Welcome back to New York."
03:16;03:18;"Thank you. Welcome back to New York yourself."
03:18;03:19;"Thank you."
03:19;03:22;"We heard you've been on a ward tour all around the world."
03:22;03:23;"Yeah."
03:23;03:24;"Where you been?"
03:24;03:26;"I actually only went to two places."
03:26;03:27;"But two--"
03:27;03:29;"Were they far away from each other?"
03:29;03:32;"Yeah, two places that are pretty far away from each other."
03:32;03:34;"The first one being Tokyo."
03:34;03:37;"The second one being Paris."
03:37;03:39;"The third one being Miami."
03:39;03:41;"But I came back here first."
03:41;03:44;"That's a world tour. That's like the world showcase at Disney World."
03:44;03:46;"I feel like Paris and Tokyo."
03:46;03:47;"And Miami."
03:47;03:49;"That's some real jet set sh*t."
03:49;03:51;"Yeah, I did my thing."
03:51;03:53;"All right, so real quick, out of those three cities, which is the best?"
03:53;03:54;"Tokyo."
03:54;03:55;"Which is the worst?"
03:55;03:56;"Paris."
03:56;03:57;"Okay."
03:57;04:00;"Wow. You were already here first."
04:00;04:03;"I'm very happy to be back here in New York City."
04:03;04:05;"I've been in LA too long."
04:05;04:07;"I got nothing against LA, but it's hot, man."
04:07;04:08;"You've been keeping it too real."
04:08;04:10;"I've been keeping it way too real."
04:10;04:13;"I think this is the first official autumn show."
04:13;04:15;"Yeah, sweater weather."
04:15;04:16;"Of Time Crisis."
04:16;04:20;"Back in New York, feeling like Patrick Ewing, the air is crisp outside."
04:20;04:24;"So I was thinking, what's some kind of autumnal music that I could play?"
04:24;04:28;"And as you know on this show, we haven't played that much new music."
04:28;04:31;"Every episode, we get a little bit closer to the modern era."
04:31;04:35;"And I know some people would probably appreciate hearing some music from the past 20 years."
04:35;04:38;"So I thought, what's music that reminds me of fall?"
04:38;04:39;"So I'll take you back."
04:39;04:41;"The fall of 2001."
04:41;04:45;"America is reeling from a major terrorist attack."
04:45;04:50;"And on that same day, as people often talk about, The Strokes' first album came out."
04:50;04:52;"I don't talk about that."
04:52;04:54;"Despot can't shut up about it."
04:54;04:59;"I always say to Despot, you know, man, Jay-Z's Blueprint also came out on September 11, 2001."
04:59;05:04;"He says, yeah, man, but the one that really sums up New York City culture is The Strokes' Is This It?"
05:04;05:06;"And I say, you know, to each his own."
05:06;05:10;"So I have memories of kind of October, November, that era."
05:10;05:12;"You and I were both seniors in high school."
05:12;05:14;"Yeah, I had a burn copy of that."
05:14;05:16;"Just living out in Jersey."
05:16;05:20;"One of them has a crazy name, like Fabrizio or something."
05:20;05:22;"Yeah, Fabrizio Moretti."
05:22;05:23;"That's crazy."
05:23;05:24;"He's a great dude."
05:24;05:27;"So this was always my favorite song from that Strokes album."
05:27;05:29;"I feel like in the early days of Time Crisis, I wouldn't have played this."
05:29;05:31;"But now I just want to play the hits."
05:31;05:32;"You know what I mean?"
05:32;05:34;"I just want to play for real indie fans."
05:34;05:38;"So here's The Strokes with a real song that reminds me of autumn."
05:38;05:40;"Someday."
05:58;06:02;"In many ways, they'll miss the good old days."
06:02;06:06;"Someday, someday."
06:06;06:11;"Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay."
06:11;06:15;"Sometimes, sometimes."
06:15;06:20;"When we were young, how many we had fun."
06:20;06:24;"Always, always."
06:24;06:29;"Promises, they break before they're made."
06:29;06:33;"Sometimes, sometimes."
06:33;06:39;"All my answers are like any tale."
06:39;06:43;"I will do my best."
06:43;06:48;"You say you want to stay by my side."
06:48;06:52;"Darling, your head's not right."
06:52;06:56;"I still always die and together we fall apart."
06:56;07:01;"Yeah, I think I'll be all right."
07:01;07:06;"I'm working so I won't have to try so hard."
07:06;07:09;"Tables, they turn sometimes."
07:09;07:15;"Oh, someday."
07:15;07:20;"No, I ain't wasting no more time."
07:38;07:42;"Now my fears, they come to me in threes."
07:42;07:46;"So I, sometimes,"
07:46;07:51;"They play to my friends and we're the strangest things."
07:51;07:55;"I find, sometimes,"
07:55;08:00;"All my answers are like any tale."
08:00;08:04;"I will try my best."
08:04;08:09;"You say you want to stay by my side."
08:09;08:13;"Darling, your head's not right."
08:13;08:17;"I still always die and together we fall apart."
08:17;08:22;"Yeah, I think I'll be all right."
08:22;08:27;"I'm working so I won't have to try so hard."
08:27;08:31;"Tables, they turn sometimes."
08:31;08:37;"Oh, someday."
08:37;08:41;"I ain't wasting no more time."
09:10;09:15;"Dead leaves and the dirty ground"
09:15;09:19;"When I know you're not around."
09:19;09:22;"Shiny tops and soda bottles"
09:22;09:26;"When I hear your lips make a sound."
09:30;09:33;"30 notes in the mailbox"
09:33;09:37;"When I tell you that I'm coming home."
09:41;09:44;"And I think I'm gonna stick around for a while"
09:44;09:46;"So you're not alone."
09:46;09:49;"For a while so you're not alone."
10:02;10:04;"If you can hear a piano fall"
10:04;10:08;"You can hear me coming down the hall."
10:08;10:10;"If I could just hear your prettier voice"
10:10;10:13;"I don't think I need to say it at all."
10:13;10:17;"Don't think I need to say it at all."
10:17;10:19;"Soft hair and a velvet tongue"
10:19;10:23;"I want to give you what you give to me."
10:23;10:25;"And every breath that is in your lungs"
10:25;10:28;"Is a tiny little gift to me."
10:47;10:51;"I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down."
10:56;10:59;"Then I come home."
10:59;11:02;"No wonder why my arms are round."
11:02;11:06;"Why my arms are round."
11:06;11:09;"Not any man with a microphone"
11:09;11:13;"Can tell you what he loves the most."
11:13;11:15;"And you know why you love it all"
11:15;11:18;"If you're thinking of the Holy Ghost."
11:33;11:35;"That was The White Stripes with Dead Leaves"
11:35;11:36;"and the Dirty Ground."
11:36;11:38;"That was another song that reminds me"
11:38;11:40;"of autumn in the early 2000s."
11:40;11:43;"Those were two big bands kind of coming out,"
11:43;11:45;"reshaping the sound of rock 'n' roll"
11:45;11:46;"in the early 2000s,"
11:46;11:48;"The White Stripes and The Strokes."
11:48;11:50;"They used to play shows together."
11:50;11:51;"I remember that show."
11:51;11:52;"You saw them together?"
11:52;11:53;"Yeah, Radio City."
11:53;11:59;"Yeah, I got a T-shirt that was like a triple XL"
11:59;12:01;"because it was the only one they had left"
12:01;12:02;"of the merch table."
12:02;12:04;"Just 'cause I was that into it"
12:04;12:06;"and I tried to wear it one time and pull it off."
12:06;12:07;"It did not work."
12:07;12:09;"You felt like you were witnessing history."
12:09;12:12;"Yeah, I just felt like that's never going to happen again."
12:12;12:14;"I'd probably have the shirt somewhere."
12:14;12:16;"I mean, those are two classic bands"
12:16;12:18;"and they're still doing their things."
12:18;12:19;"Kind of, in a sense."
12:19;12:20;"In a sense."
12:20;12:21;"Now that we're back in New York,"
12:21;12:24;"it's especially important that we get into some New York news."
12:24;12:25;"So let's hit it."
12:25;12:29;"This is New York News."
12:29;12:34;"Our producer Colin has printed out a few pieces"
12:34;12:37;"of various news items that we're going to talk about right now."
12:37;12:39;"The first one I want to talk about,"
12:39;12:40;"this is the headline,"
12:40;12:42;"""Conde Nast buys Pitchfork Media,"
12:42;12:43;"seeks Millennial Male Demo."""
12:43;12:44;"Whoa."
12:44;12:47;"""Conde Nast, which is a big media company,"
12:47;12:50;"bought Pitchfork Media, which is a smaller media company."""
12:50;12:53;"And I guess one of the guys at Conde Nast"
12:53;12:54;"said something about how--"
12:54;12:59;"He just pronounced it ""Conde Nast"" and then ""Conde Nast."""
12:59;13:01;"And the first time he pronounced it ""Conde Nast,"""
13:01;13:03;"I was like, ""Is that how you pronounce it?"""
13:03;13:05;"And then he pronounced it the other way."
13:05;13:06;"So now I'm really confused."
13:06;13:08;"ASAP Conde Nast."
13:08;13:10;"I say ""Conde Nast"" both times, I think."
13:10;13:11;"But maybe it's ""Nast."""
13:11;13:13;"No, you said ""Nast"" the first time."
13:13;13:14;"It stood out to me."
13:14;13:19;"Well, Fred Santarpia of Conde Nast said"
13:19;13:25;"that this purchase is going to bring Conde Nast,"
13:25;13:27;"a very passionate audience of Millennial Males,"
13:27;13:28;"into our roster."
13:28;13:32;"Good for them. That's a hard demographic to reach."
13:32;13:36;"I mean, everybody knows that Millennial Males are a--holes."
13:36;13:37;"I can't stand them."
13:37;13:39;"You bring a Millennial Male around me,"
13:39;13:40;"we're going to have problems."
13:40;13:42;"How much blood purchasing power?"
13:42;13:43;"But they do have purchasing power."
13:43;13:46;"How much money do you think a guy like Ryan Shriver"
13:46;13:48;"just got when this happened?"
13:48;13:49;"They're not saying."
13:49;13:52;"Easily a hundred billion dollars."
13:52;13:56;"I truly have no idea how much it cost to buy a website."
13:56;13:58;"I mean, I don't know."
13:58;13:59;"I honestly don't know how any of this stuff works."
13:59;14:02;"I know that they try to sell hipster runoff,"
14:02;14:04;"and I think that went for about $15,000."
14:04;14:05;"For real?"
14:05;14:07;"I mean, Pitchfork is definitely a bigger website,"
14:07;14:08;"don't get me wrong."
14:08;14:09;"So like 20?"
14:09;14:10;"Probably."
14:10;14:12;"I truly have no idea."
14:12;14:14;"I don't--this digital landscape terrifies me."
14:14;14:16;"It's got to be millions, right?"
14:16;14:17;"It's got to be like--"
14:17;14:18;"Millions of dollars?"
14:18;14:19;"Yeah."
14:19;14:21;"I don't know how you make money on the internet."
14:21;14:22;"Like that."
14:22;14:24;"You get bought by a big company."

22:53;23:16;"Jump man, that's a good song for"
23:17;23:23;"Autumn cuz he keeps saying Halloween in the beginning. What does he mean by that? That's what I don't remember this song"
23:23;23:32;"Let's rewind. All right, we got to take this back one more time. It's October. It already sounds over"
23:46;23:52;"Wait Taliban Halloween, he's no he's a Halloween Taliban. Oh, maybe he's gonna be Taliban"
23:52;23:57;"He's gonna be a member of the Taliban for Halloween. It's foreshadowing. He's telling you his Halloween plans"
23:57;24:04;"Now hold on say everybody here knows that I love Drake, you know, he's one of my favorite rappers"
24:04;24:07;"Everybody knows it. I'm on record as saying Drake"
24:07;24:12;"I think Drake's one of the greatest rappers of all time, but hold on a second. That doesn't mean that he's beyond criticism"
24:13;24:17;"Do you guys think that dressing up as a member of the Taliban for Halloween is offensive?"
24:17;24:25;"I want I want to talk about this seriously because on Halloween we've all seen it some some supposedly funny"
24:25;24:32;"Costumes definitely cross the line into offensiveness is Drake dressing up as Taliban for Halloween offensive Asher"
24:32;24:35;"Yeah, probably"
24:35;24:38;"Yeah, I don't think I'm trying to think of a situation you could get away with it"
24:38;24:44;"I can't really think of a situation for for Drake to pull it off. I'm willing to believe that a lot of these political"
24:44;24:46;"situations are more"
24:46;24:51;"Complicated than the mainstream media lets us know but like I'm not saying that you got to be all rah-rah"
24:51;24:57;"For the US slash Canadian military forces, but I don't know as like a joke costume dressing up"
24:57;25:01;"Well, but it also seems like a kind of right wing. Yeah, but was it"
25:01;25:06;"2015 that's an old costume at least do like Isis or something, right?"
25:06;25:09;"You're gonna be offensive I would be offended by that too"
25:09;25:15;"Taliban so they're still doing their thing. That's sure. I'm still current"
25:15;25:17;"That's a good question"
25:17;25:22;"Our producer just asked us if we think that Drake dressing up as Hitler would be an offensive Halloween costume"
25:22;25:27;"I like your tag. You're a Jewish American. I mean, you know, yes"
25:27;25:33;"But but you know if I were Drake and I dressed up as Hitler"
25:33;25:35;"I"
25:35;25:38;"Should be Drake dressed up as Hitler for Halloween"
25:38;25:45;"No, I wouldn't do that. My middle name is Israel. That's what I would your middle name is Israel. Yeah, Alec Israel"
25:45;25:47;"Wow, my nipples are air"
25:47;25:51;"For real jump man jump man jump"
25:51;25:59;"That's amazing at the end of the day Drake you dress up as whatever you want because frankly you're such a cultural force"
25:59;26:05;"He should be Michael Jordan's Halloween. It's a no-brainer. That's a good idea. Yeah, you know Michael Jordan"
26:05;26:08;"Here's another like some wide leg acid wash jeans"
26:08;26:14;"And like some and one sneaker the Lord jumpsuit"
26:14;26:17;"Here's an idea that Drake could actually pull off very well"
26:17;26:21;"If you grew his hair out a little bit is Mario because I was doing some research"
26:21;26:26;"You know what the Mario for for people who don't know he's a character"
26:26;26:30;"He's an Italian American plumber from Brooklyn created by Japanese men"
26:30;26:36;"In a first in a 1980s game called Donkey Kong and in Donkey Kong. He wasn't called Mario yet"
26:36;26:40;"You know what? He was called. No jump man. He was called jump man"
26:40;26:45;"So the original name of Mario is jump man because he jumped a lot. That's all he did was jumped over barrels"
26:45;26:49;"That was thrown by a monkey that was his only weapon"
26:49;26:53;"Here's what I propose Drake you be Mario future you be Luigi"
26:53;26:57;"And then we don't have to deal with all this Taliban Hitler stuff"
26:57;27:01;"still offensive to Italian Americans, I think"
27:01;27:03;"I"

30:58;31:00;"So that's a Nintendo sample?"
31:00;31:01;"- Yeah, I'm looking at it right now."
31:01;31:06;"It's the stage select screen for Star World"
31:06;31:08;"in Super Mario World."
31:08;31:10;"- Wait, wait. - SNES."
31:10;31:11;"- Oh, SNES. - Yeah."
31:11;31:13;"- Man, what happened to video games?"
31:13;31:14;"I feel like when we were kids,"
31:14;31:16;"everybody was playing video games."
31:16;31:17;"- Everybody still plays video games."
31:17;31:19;"- No, I mean, no, man."
31:19;31:20;"- More people play video games now."
31:20;31:23;"- No, guys, no, guys, but not like they used to."
31:23;31:25;"I remember early to mid '90s,"
31:25;31:28;"everybody had either SNES or Sega Genesis."
31:28;31:29;"- It's still the same."
31:29;31:32;"- I feel like, I don't know anybody who's in the industry."
31:32;31:33;"You know, I work in music."
31:33;31:35;"I don't know people in the gaming industry."
31:35;31:38;"But I can tell you, when I was 12, 13 years old,"
31:38;31:40;"I could not go to somebody's house"
31:40;31:43;"without seeing multiple video games and consoles."
31:43;31:45;"These days, I can't remember the last time"
31:45;31:47;"I went over to one of my friends' houses."
31:47;31:48;"What does that have to do with it?"
31:48;31:51;"- A lot, although a lot of old people,"
31:51;31:54;"I'd say way more old people play video games now"
31:54;31:56;"than old people used to play video games."
31:56;31:58;"- But you don't hear about video games anymore."
31:58;32:00;"Everybody's talking about Drake and Isis now."
32:00;32:01;"You never hear about Mario."
32:01;32:02;"- No, but what about-- - You haven't played"
32:02;32:04;"that, Drake and Isis?"
32:04;32:07;"2015? (laughing)"
32:07;32:10;"- Drake versus Isis. - Yeah, Drake versus Isis."
32:10;32:12;"I'm just saying, based on anecdotal evidence,"
32:12;32:14;"nobody plays video games anymore."
32:14;32:15;"- That's ridiculous."
32:15;32:16;"You've been in LA too long."
32:16;32:17;"- Yeah, seriously."
32:17;32:19;"- I've been on my Don Draper (beep) out in LA."
32:19;32:22;"I've been everybody plays video games in LA."
32:22;32:23;"They don't leave their houses."
32:23;32:24;"- Now hold on, guys. - Losers."
32:24;32:26;"- I'm about to drop some knowledge on you."
32:26;32:27;"You know what people do in LA?"
32:27;32:30;"- Nothing. - Surf, skateboard."
32:30;32:31;"- Hacky sack. - Hacky sack."
32:31;32:33;"- Devil sticks. - Go to pool parties."
32:33;32:35;"- Diablo. - Diablo."
32:35;32:39;"I don't know, every place is the same."
32:39;32:40;"That's the sad truth."
32:40;32:43;"In all my travels, that's what I've learned,"
32:43;32:44;"is that people everywhere are the same,"
32:44;32:45;"but not in a good way."
32:45;32:48;"In a bad way."
32:48;32:49;"Anyway, damn."
32:49;32:51;"- Form is emptiness."
32:51;32:54;"Emptiness is form."
32:54;32:56;"- There's a new James Bond movie coming out."
32:56;32:58;"I can't walk the streets of New York"
32:58;33:01;"without seeing a picture of Daniel Craig"
33:01;33:04;"looking stoned with a big skeleton face behind him,"
33:04;33:05;"aka a skull."
33:05;33:07;"Everywhere I turn, I can't stop seeing this."
33:07;33:09;"- You see that interview with him?"
33:09;33:11;"There was an interview with him like a week ago,"
33:11;33:13;"and he said he'd rather slit his wrists"
33:13;33:15;"than make another James Bond movie."
33:15;33:17;"Man, this is what happens in modern culture."
33:17;33:18;"- That can't be true."
33:18;33:21;"- I know, it must be fun."
33:21;33:22;"- No, it just can't be true."
33:22;33:25;"I don't like when people make statements like that."
33:25;33:27;"He would not rather die."
33:27;33:29;"He's alive. - Yeah, don't joke about that."
33:29;33:30;"Man, that's not funny."
33:30;33:31;"People kill themselves every day,"
33:31;33:33;"and you're out here James Bond acting like--"
33:33;33:34;"- They never get to make James Bond movies."
33:34;33:35;"- It's not that bad."
33:35;33:38;"And on top of that, man, we need a hero."
33:38;33:40;"You show me a hero, man."
33:40;33:41;"You're a hero, so anyway."
33:41;33:42;"- This next song is called ""I Need a Hero."""
33:42;33:45;"- We don't need another hero."
33:45;33:47;"- I thought maybe we could go back"
33:47;33:50;"and listen to some of the great James Bond songs"
33:50;33:52;"of all time, because some people were talking,"
33:52;33:54;"Sam Smith put out a song, a James Bond song,"
33:54;33:56;"and some people said,"
33:56;33:58;"""Well, actually, it doesn't count as a James Bond song."""
33:58;33:59;"- Why not?"
33:59;34:04;"- I think because he didn't say the name of the movie."
34:04;34:06;"I don't think he said anything about--"
34:06;34:07;"- Oh, interesting."
34:07;34:10;"- I think because he didn't say anything about spies"
34:10;34:11;"or guns or anything like that."
34:11;34:16;"So some people said you just wrote a song for James Bond"
34:16;34:18;"rather than an official James Bond song."
34:18;34:20;"- Like an ode to James Bond."
34:20;34:22;"- Yeah, he didn't name check the guy."
34:22;34:26;"Anyway, let's take it back to the old James Bond,"
34:26;34:28;"when he used to have some great songs."
34:28;34:31;"And the first one that came to mind,"
34:31;34:33;"this song's bigger than James Bond, honestly."
34:33;34:35;"This is one by Wings."
34:35;34:36;"- Sure."
34:36;34:39;"- It's a band that Paul McCourtney started"
34:39;34:41;"after the Beatles."
34:41;34:42;"And this is ""Live and Let Die."""
34:42;34:43;"This is a big song."

40:40;40:41;"A.K.A."
40:41;40:43;"[Laughter]"
40:43;40:45;"Now, a lot of people forget"
40:45;40:46;"that's a good point."
40:46;40:48;"That's a very good point because, you know,"
40:48;40:49;"back when we were kids,"
40:49;40:51;"everybody was always saying ""YOLO."""
40:51;40:52;"Remember back in middle school,"
40:52;40:53;"because Drake popularized that?"
40:53;40:56;"But back in the '60s, when we were 11,"
40:56;40:58;"back in the '60s in our parents' generation,"
40:58;40:59;"they used to say ""YOLT."""
40:59;41:00;"""You only live twice."""
41:00;41:02;"So that was another great James Bond song."
41:02;41:03;"That one's really beautiful,"
41:03;41:05;"and it was sampled by Robbie Williams."
41:05;41:06;"Yeah."
41:06;41:07;"For his, um, his--"
41:07;41:08;"It's the, like, set--"
41:08;41:10;"The one where he goes around the roller rink or whatever, right?"
41:10;41:11;"No, that was a different one."
41:11;41:12;"Oh, really?"
41:12;41:14;"This is one where he's kind of dressed like James Bond."
41:14;41:17;"I wanted to play one more James Bond song."
41:17;41:20;"A lot of people don't know that this one is a James Bond song"
41:20;41:22;"because this is another one of those songs"
41:22;41:24;"that's really much bigger than James Bond."
41:24;41:26;"This is ""Carly Simon, Nobody Does It Better."""
41:26;41:27;"You know that was a James Bond song?"
41:27;41:28;"Really?"
41:28;41:29;"No, I had no idea."
41:29;41:31;"It was from the film ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"""
41:31;41:33;"and if you listen, you'll hear she randomly says"
41:33;41:35;"""The Spy Who Loved Me"" later."
41:35;41:37;"Oh, so she got the name check in."
41:37;41:40;"Yeah, and also, one thing about this song is"
41:40;41:42;"I have a technique to help when you're feeling low,"
41:42;41:44;"when you're not feeling good about yourself,"
41:44;41:46;"and it's take-- a lot of pop songs"

41:51;41:54;"and all you have to do is change the ""you"" to the ""I."""

54:37;54:41;"and she'll take that song she made back, probably."
54:41;54:43;"Maybe they'll make me the ambassador."
54:43;54:47;"And we're back."
54:47;54:49;"Are you guys ready for the number three song?"
54:49;54:50;"Yes."
54:50;54:53;"This is ""The Weekend"" with The Hills, featuring Eminem."
54:53;54:54;"This is a remix."
54:54;54:55;"You guys remember Eminem?"
54:55;54:57;"Remember back in the '90s?"
54:57;54:59;"Back in the '90s, I remember this."
54:59;55:00;"I was 13."
55:00;55:02;"Everybody was playing video games,"
55:02;55:03;"and everybody was listening to Eminem,"
55:03;55:06;"and those are two things that I kind of miss about that time,"
55:06;55:08;"so I'm kind of happy to see that ""The Weekend"" is bringing Eminem back."
55:08;55:10;"Let's listen to his guest verse."
55:10;55:26;"What?"
55:26;55:27;"Wait, what?"
55:27;55:28;"This is Eminem?"
55:28;55:29;"I can tell."
55:29;55:34;"What the hell?"
55:50;55:52;"No one listen to techno."
55:52;55:57;"That was bewildering."
55:57;56:00;"That was bewildering, featuring Eminem."
56:02;56:06;"So, Alec, I don't think we've ever talked about Eminem on this show."
56:06;56:07;"All right."
56:07;56:10;"Now, you are also a Caucasian rapper."
56:10;56:11;"Yeah."
56:11;56:14;"A short Caucasian rapper."
56:14;56:15;"Is Eminem short?"
56:15;56:17;"No, not really."
56:17;56:18;"Just saying."
56:18;56:19;"Just making a distinction."
56:19;56:21;"Eminem's pretty tall and handsome as hell."
56:21;56:22;"Yeah."
56:22;56:23;"Actually, I have no idea."
56:23;56:24;"What?"
56:24;56:25;"Okay, so what's your take on Eminem?"
56:25;56:27;"I want to hear the big picture,"
56:27;56:29;"and then I want you to talk about this verse."
56:29;56:31;"Yeah, I'll give you the big picture,"
56:31;56:34;"and I'll make it as concise as I can."
56:34;56:38;"I went to an Eminem show at Tramps in 1999."
56:38;56:41;"He played with MF Doom and Pace One,"
56:41;56:45;"who was in the Outsiders, which was his crew from Jersey."
56:45;56:47;"He's not from Jersey, but his crew was."
56:47;56:51;"And I thought he was great, and it was 1999."
56:51;56:56;"There wasn't, like, a famous great white rapper, I guess, since Vanilla Ice."
56:56;56:59;"And I was like, ""Oh, this is cool."
56:59;57:00;"This guy can rap."
57:00;57:01;"He's good."""
57:01;57:05;"And he was rapping in a way that, in 1999, I liked."
57:05;57:06;"You know?"
57:06;57:07;"Mm-hmm."
57:07;57:11;"A very talented rapper, said a lot of curse words, was a bad guy."
57:11;57:13;"Seemed like a bad guy."
57:13;57:15;"Told everyone else that they sucked, and he was great,"
57:15;57:20;"which is what rap was all about at that moment."
57:20;57:22;"It's still about that kind of, but now it's more about,"
57:22;57:26;"""I'm richer than you, and I kill more people,"" which I like better."
57:26;57:29;"The Weeknd-Eminem remix gets an A+."
57:29;57:32;"I think it was trash."
57:32;57:33;"You thought it was trash?"
57:33;57:34;"Trash, garbage."
57:34;57:35;"Okay."
57:35;57:37;"A+, Alec gives it a zero."
57:37;57:41;"That brings it down to an F."
57:41;57:43;"The next song, number two on the iTunes chart,"
57:43;57:46;"is the same song without Eminem."
57:46;57:47;"Oh, jeez."
57:47;57:48;"Sick."
57:48;57:49;"Let's see if it's better."
57:49;57:51;"Ooh, it already sounds kind of better."
57:51;57:52;"Sorry, Em."

58:19;58:22;"Eminem pops up in the back, hiding in the closet."
58:22;58:26;"And she's like, ""Abel, you didn't say you were bringing a friend."
58:26;58:30;"I thought this was more like a one-on-one special encounter."""

58:40;58:43;"Just from a fan perspective, I would love to see an Eminem"
58:43;58:47;"and The Weeknd ""Watch the Throne""-type album."
58:47;58:50;"I'm going to say I would not like to see that."
58:50;58:53;"Alec, man, you're such a hater."
58:53;58:55;"I don't know, I feel like this is a million-dollar idea."
58:55;58:57;"How can I make this happen?"
58:57;58:59;"Well, you just put it out there on the airwaves."
58:59;59:02;"You just got to sit back and wait for those emails to roll in."
59:02;59:04;"You know, sometimes my life coach tells me that"
59:04;59:06;"when you want something to happen, you just got to put it out"
59:06;59:08;"into the universe, and the universe will answer."
59:08;59:10;"You have to tell people that it's already happening."
59:12;59:14;"You just have to announce it on the radio."
59:14;59:17;"The Eminem and The Weeknd mixtape is about to come out"
59:17;59:20;"right before Coachella and Flushing Meadow Park."
59:20;59:23;"Right before Queen's Coachella."
59:23;59:29;"I mean, like, at Queen's Coachella, the two kings of music--"
59:29;59:31;"[laughter]"
59:31;59:34;"I'm putting this out in the universe, guys. It's important."
59:34;59:38;"2016, right before Queen's Coachella, the two kings of music."
59:38;59:40;"That's right, I'm talking about The Weeknd and Eminem"
59:40;59:43;"drop their mixtape. It's happening. You heard it here first."
59:43;59:46;"- What's it called? - ""On Time Crisis."""
59:46;59:49;"It's called ""You Act Like You've Never Seen..."""
59:49;59:52;"""You Act Like You've Never Seen a Duo Before."""
59:55;59:58;"Are you guys ready for the number one song on the charts right now?"
59:58;01:00:00;"- Can't wait. - Yeah."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"This is a song by my favorite rapper,"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"who maybe has some questionable Halloween outfit choices,"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"but still, we can admit, is definitely one of the most"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"fascinating cultural figures, the greatest rapper,"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"and an incredible hit maker. You know that Drake has had"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"over 100 Billboard Top 100 singles?"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- Really? - Yeah."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"That sounds like a--"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"It's not even that long a period of time."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"- That's like an eighth of Eminem's career. - No, it's incredible."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"- Drake is the Beatles. - Yeah."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"That's so prime for a rap line."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"Like, 100, top 100 hits."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"I can't believe he hasn't even said it yet."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"I wonder if this is number 100. I don't know."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"But anyway, here is Drake with the number one song on iTunes right now."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"Great song, ""Hotline Bling."""

01:02:06;01:02:08;"- Now, a lot of people think that this is Drake"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"returning to his sad boy persona."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"Talking about lost love."
01:02:13;01:02:17;"I guess he didn't do too much of that on the future mixtape."

01:02:18;01:02:20;"if you're reading this, it's too late."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"- I was mostly gloating."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"He was gloating a lot."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Gloating."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"But there's a time to gloat and there's a time to--"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- Be sad. - Be sad."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Yeah."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"- And Drake has mastered that."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"That's why he has 100, top 100 singles."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- Yeah, I love sad Drake."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- All right, let's listen to the Spanish hotline bling."

01:02:38;01:02:41;"- Fuego, that means fire in Spanish."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- Yeah, and I like how he specifically"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"references the iPhone in his song,"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"whereas Drake talks about a cell phone."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"This guy keeps saying iPhone, and I like that."

01:24:18;01:24:21;"for the first time, playing at Purchase College,"
01:24:21;01:24:26;"covering himself in flour and wrapping himself in plastic like he does."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Cool."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"And then he started playing shows again."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"He played at Lit not long after that."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"You helped to reinvigorate his career."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"I did."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"I think the lesson is next time you're at the porno store"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"and you see the creepy guy with the ponytail,"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"you'll probably think he's just some weird--"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"Invite him to an educational place to play music."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"Invite him to your college, look him for your mixtape."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Where your kids are learning, and then--"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Ask him for a mixtape."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"That is a dope story."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Let's listen to ""Linda Wants to Be Alone"" from Gary Wilson."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Good one."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Linda wants to be alone"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Linda wants to eat alone"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Linda wants to sleep alone"

01:25:13;01:25:15;"You know I try to get my keep"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"The walls are closing in on me"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"All into the night"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Every night I try to teach"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Linda sees so odd and rich"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"The girls are swimming at the beach"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"All into the night"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Linda wants to be alone"

01:25:43;01:25:45;"Talk to me, tell me what to do"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"I gotta get away from you"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Tell me what was really true"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"All into the night"

01:26:13;01:26:15;"All into the night"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I remember when I was going downtown the other night"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"I thought I saw Linda"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Standing near the corner"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"And for a moment there"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"I lost my balance and I slipped on the floor"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"I started to get dizzy"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"And the only memory that started following me"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Was Linda sitting near the Susquehanna River"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"She was writing a note"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"She was writing a note to my parents"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Saying that I was bothering her"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"She said I kept asking her"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Calling her up at all hours"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Saying I needed her, I loved her"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"Linda, whatever happened to us"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"We used to get together once in a while"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"But now I'm not sure"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"I'm not sure"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Linda wants to be alone"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Linda wants to eat alone"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Linda wants to sleep alone"

01:27:03;01:27:05;"Linda wants to be alone"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Linda wants to eat alone"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"That was Gary Wilson with"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Linda Wants to Be Alone"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Can I play a song? Yes please"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"I have this one song that's just, you know"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"I get on like total repeat with songs while listening to the same song over and over again"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"And there was this amazing"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Do you guys know the filmmaker"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Todd Haynes?"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Oh yeah, sure"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"So Todd Haynes, like his"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"I don't know, I don't want to speak out of turn"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"But some like underground project he did"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"In art school or film school"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Was a Karen Carpenter documentary"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Yes, I've never seen it till this week"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"And I don't know, have you guys seen it?"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"I've never actually seen it. I saw it in college"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"It's pretty great. Yeah, it's nuts"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Well they play this one song that's not a Carpenter song"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"By Gilbert O'Sullivan"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Called Alone Again Naturally"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Oh I know that song, it does a bit"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Alone again naturally"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"But that's what I've been listening to on repeat"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Yeah that's tight"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I mean I don't feel alone or anything"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"With a little while from now"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"If I'm not feeling any less sour"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"I promise myself to treat myself"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"And visit a nearby tower"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"And climbing to the top"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Will throw my soul"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Into the water"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"And I'll"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Throw myself off"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"In an effort to"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Make clear to everyone"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"It's like when you're shattered"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Left standing in the lurch"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"At a church where people"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Sing my God"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"That's tough, she stood him up"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"No point in us remaining"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"She may as well go home"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"As I did on my own"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"Alone again"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Naturally"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"To think that only yesterday"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"I was cheerful, bright and gay"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Looking forward to"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"What I wouldn't do"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"The role I was about to play"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"But as if to knock me down"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Reality came around"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"And without so much"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"As a mere touch"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Cut me into little pieces"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"Leading me to doubt"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Talk about God in your eyes"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"And I'm not sure"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Talk about God in His mercy"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"If He really does exist"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Why did He deserve me"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"In my hour of need"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"I truly am indeed"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Alone again"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Naturally"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"It seems to me"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"That there are more hearts"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Broken in the world"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"That can't be mended"

01:32:00;01:32:01;"- Do you remember?"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- Like years ago?"

01:32:03;01:32:04;"- Did it?"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"- And you're like, this song's depressing."

01:34:07;01:34:09;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis."""
01:34:09;01:34:10;"That song was really--"
01:34:10;01:34:11;"- Fire."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"(laughing)"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"- Oh nice, we're doing it."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"- Yeah we got the soundboard."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"- This was a Despot suggestion yesterday"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"was to load up some audio emoji"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"so that when we play a song that's really--"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"- No but explain how that works"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"'cause I didn't know that that existed."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"I don't think most people know that exists"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"that you can do that."
01:34:29;01:34:32;"- Yeah, you can make your phone tell you what an emoji is."
01:34:32;01:34:35;"It is for blind people I guess"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"'cause you have to enable the handicap function"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"or whatever they call it, something services."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"- 'Cause just like if you couldn't see"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"and you needed somebody to read your text,"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"what are they gonna do when they get to the emoji?"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"- What if you send them an emoji?"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- But how would they know?"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"- It's not the word for it."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"- If you were blind, how would you know"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"that Siri was saying the emoji"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"and not saying the actual word?"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Wait, this is the best one."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"- Smiling pile of poo."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"- Yeah, that's the one."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"- I never use that emoji though."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"I think it's disgusting."
01:35:02;01:35:06;"- Babylon the Great has fallen."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"- You know, we record this show in New York"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"even though most of the music business has moved to L.A."
01:35:11;01:35:14;"And you, Jonah, who are kind of bucking the trend"
01:35:14;01:35:19;"of the artists, the great exodus of artists out of New York"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"when we got some people coming in."
01:35:21;01:35:27;"- Yeah, I lived here half the time for like three years."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"- Like in college?"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"- No, no, no, like the past three years."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"- Oh, right, right, right."
01:35:31;01:35:35;"- But moved here full time like October of last year"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"or September, October."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"But it's funny because if you said a lot of music people"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"are moving to L.A."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"But basically what I did was I wrote down"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"all my favorite film directors"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"'cause I wanna be directing movies"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"and I wrote down all my favorite film directors"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"and they all live in New York."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"So that made it an easier decision to go,"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"well, if all these great film directors"
01:35:57;01:36:00;"can live in New York, then maybe you can get away with it"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"without having to live in Los Angeles."
