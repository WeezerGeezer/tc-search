01:47;01:51;"I don't know this song. See if we can find a recording of Don't Quit Your Day Job."
01:51;01:55;"I listened to it once or twice, it didn't make a big impression, but what I found"
01:55;02:01;"interesting about it was that apparently the Deadheads did not respond kindly to"
02:01;02:07;"the sentiment. Was it like quit following us around? Well, like Ship of Fools kind of"

04:07;04:15;"hey and you work for me far out man can't think of a theme that the Dead"
04:15;04:23;"Heads would be less receptive to then don't quit your day job that's really"
04:23;04:28;"it's kind of kind of wild they're like their whole subculture was like people"
04:28;04:33;"you know quitting their day job and following them on tour and being like"
04:33;04:39;"you know what forget this the system of capitalism let's just like trade veggie"
04:39;04:45;"burritos in the parking lot right camp out have a good time and then the dead"
04:45;04:50;"get up there and are just like plug back in plug back your society you could"
04:50;04:57;"actually imagine I mean statistically there must be somebody who had just"
04:57;05:01;"quit their day job to follow the dead mm-hmm ingest a massive amount of acid"
05:01;05:07;"or psilocybin at their first show in their brand new life and right when it's"
05:07;05:11;"hitting they hear a song they never heard before and they just see Jerry"
05:11;05:16;"singing keep your day job don't give it away keep your day job whatever they say"
05:16;05:21;"and they were just like what like it is a message from the universe you you"
05:21;05:27;"really up bro hey Matt Matt found it and when he does I'm just reading I'm through"
05:27;05:34;"I'm on a message board and someone wrote I was reading the box of rain the lyrics"
05:34;05:40;"book and it said that this song day job was removed due to fan requests removed"
05:40;05:47;"from the I guess from like any what is this is a part of the record I mean"
05:47;05:52;"that's insane I originally liked the song but was bummed to hear it at every"
05:52;05:56;"other show so they played it a lot in it too much yeah that's what they're"
05:56;06:00;"saying but then other people are like it's a bummer sentiment we're gonna add"
06:00;06:05;"this to the richer picture set yeah open with it"
06:09;06:19;"kind of a US blues yeah"
06:19;06:24;"it's a real right rewrite of you"
06:24;06:34;"this is from the Hartford Civic Center Oh Connecticut I like this 10 1483"
06:34;06:46;"I could see musically with the lyrics this could be tongue-in-cheek"
06:46;06:56;"I mean if I was like stone or drunk a dead show in 83 and I was like what are"
06:56;07:00;"these things about a day job I would assume that it was like some yes some"
07:00;07:06;"sarcastic sender right cuz like us blues is kind of sarcastic yeah I don't think"
07:06;07:12;"if the dead is having like a lot of earnest messaging so it's weird to"
07:12;07:16;"think about people taking this seriously"
07:16;07:24;"which is to say"
07:24;07:39;"I kind of want to cover this this is a perfect song for Richard pictures where"
07:39;07:46;"everyone is in their late 30s and 40s and has day jobs yeah you at this show"
07:46;07:49;"you could say I know there might be some people in the crowd tonight who've quit"
07:49;07:53;"their jobs to be here but I want you to understand something about all these guys"
07:53;08:00;"on stage we have day jobs do not follow us this is a passion project we're not"
08:00;08:03;"playing that many shows"
08:03;08:21;"well I love this it has almost classic Jerry cord loose yeah this would have"
08:21;08:26;"been great on in the dark yeah"
08:26;08:41;"it is funny for them to say this is gonna be the one we play in every show"
08:41;08:49;"I mean it kind of rips I could see them being psyched on"
08:49;09:18;"I don't know if we can address the elephant in the room any further what are you wearing"
09:18;09:24;"then well this was just cosmic timing when I came home there's a big box of"
09:24;09:30;"stuff in the house from Adidas I think primarily they were lacing my"
09:30;09:37;"significant other mm-hmm with some swag but there was something in the box for"
09:37;09:41;"me I'd like to see her in this unless maybe this was meant for Rashida but it"
09:41;09:46;"was there a note that said Ezra no it was unclear but this is it's just my"
09:46;09:53;"size and it's a it's a classic black Adidas tracksuit I'm not wearing the"
09:53;09:56;"pants but I have them in the other room and basically it's just a classic black"
09:56;10:02;"Adidas tracksuit but on the top and the bottom it says corn k-or-n like the corn"
10:02;10:08;"logo and that's all I know about it but it's not like a corn logo it is the corn"
10:08;10:13;"logo yeah this is official Adidas actually I don't know the backstory"
10:13;10:18;"maybe Nick you can do some research yeah Adidas and corn linked up now of course"
10:18;10:25;"I am a corn fan and I had at least one corn CD in the 90s and I always had a"
10:25;10:31;"soft spot for them and I remember they had a song called Adidas except in their"
10:31;10:37;"version it's all day I dream about sex okay took me a second there but I guess"
10:37;10:40;"probably you know I wonder if Adidas used to be more conservative but after"
10:40;10:42;"everything they've been through with Kanye they're probably just like oh who"
10:42;10:46;"gives a f*** this link up with corn this is the all day I dream about sex"
10:46;10:51;"collection actually can we throw that on"
10:51;11:09;"picture this I pull up to one of your guys houses just blasting this throw open"
11:09;11:16;"the door I get out of my full Adidas corn tracksuit just like"
11:32;11:38;"late 90s early 2000s let me take off like that I think this is my least"
11:38;11:43;"favorite subgenre of rock this is from 1997"
11:43;11:55;"corn and Adidas have an interesting history hmm"
11:55;12:02;"so Adidas gave corn free product back in the day so around you know mid 90s but"
12:02;12:07;"they were unwilling to sign the band to a proper deal so instead corn ink to"
12:07;12:14;"deal with Puma in 98 so they were officially rep by Puma and then you know"
12:14;12:20;"Jonathan Davis told Kerrang we switched to Puma because they told us they put us"
12:20;12:24;"in a commercial and give us a little money to wear their sh*t I kind of respect"
12:24;12:30;"that you want to know how it works they gave us a little money to wear their"
12:30;12:36;"sh*t and now they you know but I think they've always I mean they always wore"
12:36;12:39;"those Adidas shoes that I remember"
12:39;12:45;"black Adidas they wore and yeah I think these guys and so now they I think time"
12:45;12:50;"has passed they have official collab that apparently came out in like late"
12:50;12:56;"October but I the shoes I'd seen before they look sick do you have the shoes on"
12:56;13:01;"no I don't know if I got a check I saw there were some shoes but I mean I don't"
13:01;13:08;"know if anybody's ripped Adidas is hard since Run DMC Run DMC and then corn are"
13:08;13:13;"the kind of the ultimate Adidas artists wait so Jake do you like any corn songs"
13:13;13:20;"no wait not throw out a good band freak on a leash I use the term freak on a"
13:20;13:26;"leash a lot though when I walk my dog because my dog is pretty mellow but when"
13:26;13:34;"I put her on the leash that's when her anxiety and her resistance oh yeah this"
13:34;13:38;"is this is iconic"
13:45;13:54;"epic Woodstock 99 performance to this song yeah crazy so far so good right you"
13:54;13:58;"know I feel about Nine Inch Nails this is the same and this is pretty Nine Inch"
13:58;14:05;"Nails this song the same emotional palette the same kind of vocal approach"
14:05;14:13;"yeah very mannered like aggro angsty I just I can't hang I just can't take it"
14:13;14:18;"seriously what about when he gets big"
14:18;14:40;"this is what I tapped out of like alternative rock radio like 97 they"
14:40;14:45;"started you're not a kind of garbage and I was like this is active rock what's"
14:45;14:50;"that in radio there was this term active rock for like this kind of music I don't"
14:50;14:56;"know that term active rock I was like oh like mid 90s alt radio it was like Oh"
14:56;15:01;"Green Day and Weezer and Nirvana and STP I was like this is cool and then they"
15:01;15:05;"started playing this kind of stuff and I was like I'm out"
15:05;15:18;"I feel ill listening to this music would you really is the worst crap it really is"
15:18;15:24;"if I got you one would you wear a corn track suit absolutely not really what"
15:24;15:33;"about just like the top pair with a nice pair of jeans I couldn't do it dude no"
15:33;15:36;"are you wearing a bucket hat - what's going on with the hats that part of the"
15:36;15:42;"there's an Adidas not corn this is not a bucket hat an Adidas bucket hat so I'm"
15:42;15:47;"on the face I'm I'm looking at Ezra he's rocking a white bucket hat and then the"
15:47;15:56;"black Adidas track suit with the corn look it's a solid look then takes a part"
15:56;16:03;"of me just even though even their logo I can't stand it it looks like a bad why"
16:03;16:11;"is that aren't backwards it's a bad horror movie like a kid like a demented"
16:11;16:16;"demonic possessed kid wrote like corn I carved corn into like their sister's"
16:16;16:20;"stomach or something and it's like yeah I think that's like exactly what they're"
16:20;16:25;"going for yeah I'm not into like horror rock well that's what corn's music is"
16:25;16:31;"all about the dark side of life even one of their big hit albums was ironically"
16:31;16:36;"titled life is peachy which is obviously not the the kind of worldview of the"
16:36;16:42;"music hey corn don't quit your day job oh wait oh you guys made millions of"
16:42;16:46;"dollars oh yeah they're crushing actually quit your day job"
16:46;16:52;"what about blind is it a band no that was like the the first kind of radio hit"
16:52;16:59;"on their first album I don't know throw it on this is are you there are you"
16:59;17:10;"ready song I think this is where are you ready"
17:10;17:18;"track one debut album okay I'm here in 1994"
17:18;17:24;"well 94 earlier than I would have thought so this was this on an indie"
17:24;17:30;"label it didn't get a lot of big play I'm not sure I don't remember this being"
17:30;17:35;"on like MTV you just bought this at Sam Goody you get in your car put this in"
17:35;17:44;"track one you're like okay you have my interest long intro yeah"
17:46;17:53;"yeah a new era has begun see it's a funny it's very like narcissism a small"
17:53;17:57;"difference to stuff because I really liked raging against the machine right"
17:57;18:03;"you're right corn has like a heart is how that would stock 99 set up okay and"
18:03;18:09;"it just gets just just angrier and heavier that's the only thing I think you"
18:09;18:14;"have to give them credit like we've talked a lot about the track one on the"
18:14;18:19;"debut album right Mountain Brews kicked it off with Mountain Brews track one on"
18:19;18:24;"Mountain Brews EP perfect introduction to the project"
18:24;18:28;"vampire got a game of the quads for proof vampire kicks it off with a"
18:28;18:34;"mansard roof like it's all right there and corn kicks it off with blind I mean"
18:34;18:39;"there is something so hard about just track one"
18:39;18:50;"I don't this did not cross my desk in 94 okay but I feel like now you're"
18:50;18:56;"finding a way into corn now I have a way in start with the first one I wouldn't"
18:56;18:59;"go that far"
18:59;19:08;"I do like it more than the later stuff but I still don't like it fair enough"
19:08;19:13;"I'm allergic to that Trent Reznor"
19:13;19:17;"it's funny because I mean we've talked about this on the show I think people"
19:17;19:20;"even wrote in being like I can't believe Jake doesn't like Nine Inch Nails I'd"
19:20;19:24;"like to share with him some didn't have somebody who sent some songs to try to"
19:24;19:28;"convert you but I won't sell in any of them but I think there's probably a lot"
19:28;19:32;"of Nine Inch Nails fans that if they met you and you were just like man I don't"
19:32;19:35;"corn is not for me they'd be like oh totally and then you're like it's got"
19:35;19:39;"that Trent Reznor energy and they'd be like whoa fall back dude they'd be like"
19:39;19:44;"oh my they're like oh absolutely corn sucks and you're like yeah this because"
19:44;19:49;"it sounds like Nine Inch Nails right and they'd be like how dare you that's a"
19:49;19:53;"fun that'd be a funny like Twitter poll like what percentage of Nine Inch Nails"
19:53;20:00;"fans also love corn I think it's that's like the equivalent of like it would be"
20:00;20:06;"that in the same way that you could picture all right maybe we've heard"
20:06;20:09;"enough corn no I kind of like it going in the back now you go you getting in"
20:09;20:13;"it's just kind of funny to have in the background I think I think it's the same"
20:13;20:19;"way that there's probably like like a product some like really like highbrow"
20:19;20:24;"radio head fans yeah and and you could probably name a lot of like 90s"
20:24;20:30;"alternative bands or other bands like Muse or something I was just gonna say"
20:30;20:34;"Muse like I bet if you were just kind of like man I can't stand a Muse man and"
20:34;20:38;"they'd be like oh I'm with you I'm really not into Muse and be like exactly"
20:38;20:42;"this reminds me of Radiohead who sucks too they'd be like oh my god man no I"
20:42;20:47;"thought we were bonding on hating Muse you're like no I mean in fact I if I"
20:47;20:52;"guess if I had to pick one I'd pick Muse cuz at least they're less pretentious"
20:52;20:59;"they're less pretentious like damn dude oh that's really funny cuz I think Nine"
20:59;21:03;"Inch Nails have their fans would probably feel like it's more intellectual"
21:03;21:07;"than corn and I mean you know obviously say what you will you know Trent Reznor"
21:07;21:12;"you know he scored the social network well yeah and it's like industrial it's"
21:12;21:15;"like with you know a lot of synth and like it's not just like a rock band"
21:15;21:20;"which I think corn is just I think it's just you know bass guitar and drums okay"
21:20;21:24;"wait but I got a selling point for you Jake you know where corn's from?"
21:24;21:29;"Bakersfield okay yeah I figured that I think you'd be into that that's"
21:29;21:32;"fascinating to me especially when you consider the the rich history of"
21:32;21:36;"Bakersfield country you know Merle Haggard and Buck Owens oh yeah we must"
21:36;21:40;"have I know we've talked about this before yeah like the if you think about"
21:40;21:47;"you picture like 1950s Bakersfield with all the the children of the of the"
21:47;21:51;"Okies that had showed up there in during the Great Depression and then their"
21:51;21:54;"children be going to make this country music in Bakersfield and it becomes like"
21:54;22:01;"this rich chapter in the in American music history and then like fast"
22:01;22:09;"forward 40 years mm-hmm and what's the music coming out of Bakersfield? Corn."
22:09;22:16;"That's a true like Adam Curtis kind of like yeah no that term paper on like the"
22:16;22:21;"trajectory of American culture or whatever absolutely you know um Jonathan"
22:21;22:28;"Davis and a bunch of the other members of corn Fieldy and Monkey one of their"
22:28;22:37;"first bands was a funk metal band with a great name LAPD that is sick and they"
22:37;22:44;"alternately would would say that it stood for love and peace dude and then"
22:44;22:49;"later laughing as people die I like the first one can we see if we can pull up"
22:49;22:55;"any LAPD maybe their first album love so that's is that like early 90s their"
22:55;23:01;"first EP came out in 89 Wow so the corn guys were like they've been doing it for"
23:01;23:05;"a minute I mean Jonathan Davis was born in 71 yeah so I guess they were"
23:05;23:11;"recording when he was like 18 and then yeah by the time corn was big he was in"
23:11;23:23;"his 20s late 20s I wonder if LAPD came in and played shows with like fishbone"
23:23;23:29;"and stuff like right what was the scene probably some Chili's shows yeah yeah"
23:29;23:33;"they must love the chili peppers"
23:35;23:48;"interesting to like like rip the phone is that a PD yeah I'm feeling this wait"
23:48;23:53;"but I'm seeing that there was a jazz group from the 70s called LAPD so we're"
23:53;24:00;"having some ambiguity here multiple LAPD bands love and peace dude I wonder if"
24:00;24:05;"they played a show with the pimps wait who are the pimps the pimps were a kind"
24:05;24:11;"of like chili peppers adjacent kind of funk band that my uncle Ted played bass"
24:11;24:21;"in hmm and around this time 89 88 87 89 in that era I remember when I was a kid"
24:21;24:27;"he had sent us a videotape of the pimps playing like some club in LA and I"
24:27;24:35;"watched it so much they had this song called super stupid funky spy cuz I'm a"
24:35;24:47;"funky spy and this kind of sick riff I think the pimps had had very brief"
24:47;24:53;"interest from some labels okay all right what what else is going on we said we"
24:53;24:58;"talked about classical yeah we're gonna do some vampire so you guys why no Nick"
24:58;25:03;"as Jake you said you were blasting classical in the minivan I blasted"
25:03;25:07;"classical in the minivan pretty sure you and it down the freeway"
25:07;25:14;"oh yeah loving the sax solo yeah that part is sick and then I was like you"
25:14;25:18;"know it is you listening to music you're blasting it you're in the car and I'm"
25:18;25:24;"like something about a crew right this is about the crisis crew this is an ode"
25:24;25:29;"to the crisis crew no it's how the crew with time becomes classical right yeah"
25:29;25:36;"it's actually it's actually cruel oh it's okay that's a much more interesting"
25:36;25:42;"how the crew win time somebody else could do it I totally thought it was how"
25:42;25:46;"the crew in time becomes classical yeah not cruel but you're right the very"
25:46;25:52;"similar words we finally made a video that we're performing in that I actually"
25:52;25:58;"like I've always had like an issue where with so many of our videos like we've"
25:58;26:01;"really done a video that's just like the band standing somewhere playing the"
26:01;26:06;"classical we finally did one where's just us on a green screen maybe that's"
26:06;26:11;"what we should always just do just get in front of a green screen but the vast"
26:11;26:15;"majority of the video is just like us kind of performing in a green screen and"
26:15;26:19;"I was like very pleased with how it turned out so often we make videos and"
26:19;26:23;"like I see the shots of us playing and I'm just like yeah it just looks like"
26:23;26:28;"kind of funny or something but this one actually worked out yeah I thought it"
26:28;26:35;"was great we had some cameos from RAL that's right and Josh Goldsmith yeah"
26:35;26:41;"met him yes that guy has an awesome look yeah great dude he was a guest on"
26:41;26:45;"vampire campfire the vampire weekend podcast how's that going I haven't"
26:45;26:53;"tuned in yet we've only done two eps but it's great you know we it's like kind of"
26:53;26:57;"we've been hanging out forever so it's I guess not dissimilar from time crisis"
26:57;27:00;"just you know we got certain things that just like you and me have had things"
27:00;27:06;"that we've talked about for borderline 20 years now so is it highly focused on"
27:06;27:10;"vampire material are there a lot of tangents they're starting to be tangents"
27:10;27:14;"like yeah we you know it is the vampire weekend podcast so it's a good place for"
27:14;27:19;"vampire weekend news like in the first episode we talked a lot about the tour"
27:19;27:25;"and all the openers we talked about any of that I think Jake's getting at is how"
27:25;27:33;"close how close is this gonna edge into TC territory well are we feeling"
27:33;27:39;"nervous oh I said on the last episode I was uncomfortable with vampire campfire"
27:39;27:46;"existing vampire campfire well I guess I'll give it a hate listen"
27:46;28:01;"James is like zero corporate food history no tasteful palate it's it's also like"
28:01;28:06;"shorter we're keeping them short short and punchy and I'm sure it'll never have"
28:06;28:13;"the regularity of time crisis but yeah it's a good place to kind of go deeper"
28:13;28:19;"on kind of vampire weekend history future yes like one episode we went deep"
28:19;28:23;"on the tour and we got to like actually break down all the openers I don't know"
28:23;28:27;"if I talked about that I don't think I think we talked about that off mic maybe"
28:27;28:33;"I don't remember us maybe off the show I mean I know I don't want to you know no"
28:33;28:36;"spoilers I know you're having a Billy Joel cover band open for you that's"
28:36;28:42;"announced okay at MSG okay yeah turnstiles great love that which was"
28:42;28:49;"funny when we announced the tour because a publicist said she got many responses"
28:49;28:53;"from press outlets when she sent out the press release where she talked about how"
28:53;28:58;"the band hand-picked all the openers doing special bills for certain cities"
28:58;29:02;"and breaking up all the legs and say like very proud to announce in New York"
29:02;29:07;"we'll have we're doing a weekend at the garden we got Mark Ronson DJing Saturday"
29:07;29:12;"night Brothers Macklevich DJing Sunday and both Saturday night and Sunday"
29:12;29:17;"morning will be joined by turnstiles and she got many people saying you had an s"
29:17;29:23;"there you clearly must be talking about the beloved new school hardcore band"
29:23;29:29;"turnstile right and we had to tell many people first of all how dare you"
29:29;29:33;"turnstiles is one of America's premier Billy Joel cover bands although actually"
29:33;29:37;"I've noticed something that because I've seen um they've been doing a little bit"
29:37;29:42;"of press already about the show and I think I think this is maybe this is true"
29:42;29:45;"with Richard Pictures - there's like a thing maybe cover band is not like the"
29:45;29:51;"preferred way to call it it's tribute act I think is the best I refer to"
29:51;29:54;"Richard Pictures as a cover band because we're a bar band I mean it's a cover"
29:54;29:58;"band right see if you if you see any video of turnstiles they're not a bar"
29:58;30:01;"band they're like doing like pretty like significant touring and it's like it's"
30:01;30:05;"like a real show with lights and everything I think as soon as you quit"
30:05;30:12;"your day job there you go it becomes a tribute band and I don't know exactly if"
30:12;30:19;"the guys in the band it seems like like some of them might do it full-time and"
30:19;30:23;"it definitely seems like the lead singer Tony Monaco he's like full-time music"
30:23;30:27;"industry kind of guy like he has his own company called Tony Monaco"
30:27;30:31;"productions or something like that so there is a Billy there is like a guy"
30:31;30:35;"playing piano and singing all of the songs yeah Tony Monaco okay they don't"
30:35;30:40;"like have different guys okay as you might know this do you think I do"
30:40;30:45;"believe it might have to do with the level of like not just passion but time"
30:45;30:49;"you give it but is there also possibly something with like the legality of"
30:49;30:53;"saying like an interpolation or something like it's a tribute and not a"
30:53;31:00;"cover like especially if maybe at their size you don't want to oh I mean I think"
31:00;31:05;"anybody's allowed to cover a song I'd like to think that the long arm of the"
31:05;31:11;"law is not coming after a cover band are you a cover band or you tribute act"
31:11;31:15;"tribute act all right let me see your documentation on that and you're free to"
31:15;31:21;"go let me see your tax ID number just getting pulled over and in Oklahoma"
31:21;31:27;"it's like blues brothers boys oh you boys you boys are a long way from New"
31:27;31:33;"York we don't get too many a city folk out here yeah we're just a bunch of"
31:33;31:38;"musicians Oh musicians boy we've had a lot of musicians come through they like"
31:38;31:43;"to cause trouble what do you guys do an original material no sir no original"
31:43;31:53;"material we're a tribute act tribute act you sure you're not a cover band no sir"
31:53;31:58;"we are more or less professional many of us have quit our day jobs we are a"
31:58;32:02;"tribute act because we don't really appreciate cover bands coming through"
32:02;32:09;"out of this county no sir we're it's all in the up-and-up we are tribute act get"
32:09;32:17;"out of the car that is legally certified certified but yeah and I know a little"
32:17;32:22;"bit about turnstiles the Tony Monaco the singer spent years of his life living on"
32:22;32:27;"Long Island they're based in Florida now but he's a they're one of the leading"
32:27;32:32;"lights of the of the Billy cover world and if you watch the videos of them you"
32:32;32:36;"can tell that their shows yeah not really bar band it's like you know"
32:36;32:41;"theaters and stuff yeah all sorts of different stuff and anyway that that'll"
32:41;32:45;"be a spell and that one's for New York only and just like in LA we're doing the"
32:45;32:49;"sky night with the voodoo glow skulls and English beat and stuff like that"
32:49;32:54;"Austin the next show the one that'll be our first show that'll be happening not"
32:54;33:00;"too long opener no opener in Austin tight because you know it's like the middle of"
33:00;33:05;"the day and it's the Eclipse and and all that perhaps some special guests cool"
33:05;33:08;"keep your eyes peeled for that but anyway these are the type of things we've"
33:08;33:13;"been talking about on vampire campfire and there is a part of me that would"
33:13;33:18;"actually enjoy telling you some of the tangents we've gone on but that's getting"
33:18;33:23;"a little bit too crazy if I go from vampire campfire back to TC and say like"
33:23;33:27;"you know they told me something interesting kind of got us talking I"
33:27;33:32;"think that's that's too much repeat repeated content that's too deep yeah"
33:32;33:37;"here's another Twitter poll how many people how many time crisis fans are"
33:37;33:42;"listening to vampire I can't say it vampire campfire yeah a vampire campfire"
33:42;33:50;"fans are called VCS BCA your TV sees oh yeah VC heads VCRs and someone's like I"
33:50;33:54;"can't stand vampire campfire so annoying it's giving me that TC energy and"
33:54;34:04;"someone's like whoa yeah yeah right like now it's like yeah can't stand time"
34:04;34:09;"crisis and now I got vampire campfire well so don't listen then don't listen"
34:09;34:16;"haters but anyway that's the place to go for the hardcore VW content I mean you"
34:16;34:19;"know it's so much as music I feel like it speaks for itself let's just throw on"
34:19;34:23;"classical listen to it"
34:23;34:33;"I haven't listened to classical since the video shoot"
34:33;34:39;"it's funny we were first working on this I wondered if like the guitar tone was"
34:39;34:44;"like too distorted and now I listen to it I'm like what was I scared of sounds"
34:44;34:49;"normal I'm gonna pull up the lyrics oh yeah right now you can actually know"
34:49;34:53;"what I'm saying"
34:53;34:55;"Oh"
34:55;35:13;"competed for the zoo such a plea Sunrise Oh true Oh and I'm natural how the crew"
35:13;35:22;"with time becomes classical this is bleak"
35:22;35:43;"shake this about Shake Shack just to feel good burgers and shakes on it's a"
35:43;35:46;"classic spot"
35:46;35:48;"Oh"
35:48;35:57;"some of the cool cool developments in the burger chain world over the past 20"
35:57;36:00;"years"
36:00;36:06;"Lonnie's got up quite a bit now you go to any midsize US city you're gonna have"
36:06;36:13;"five guys a shake maybe some independent stuff like the real interesting stuff"
36:13;36:18;"happening in the burger"
36:18;36:20;"Oh"
36:20;36:28;"with time becomes classical"
36:28;36:31;"I know that was"
36:31;36:37;"something's gonna change"
36:37;36:41;"I like this I like I'm spending some time with the lyrics and thinking about it"
36:41;36:47;"trying to formulate a thought here while the music plays look but make classical"
36:47;36:56;"is a word I love this part yeah we had um when Arielle's go to saxophone guys"
36:56;37:03;"Henry Solomon I think he probably ripped like 40 minutes of stuff and then we"
37:03;37:09;"took all our favorite parts and kind of arranged and rearranged it mm-hmm like I"
37:09;37:14;"think this solo is is actually both alto and tenor so what he heard it was he"
37:14;37:21;"just like what the hell is this I didn't yeah we probably didn't remember it like"
37:21;37:25;"oh yeah the solo I did"
37:25;37:33;"and I love this breakdown is one of my favorite parts coming up we have a"
37:33;37:36;"little slide up here"
37:36;37:53;"I know that was by Shaq Sheck, Fish is Burning by the Breakers Club, something's gonna change and when it does, we're just classical, am I right?"
38:04;38:10;"I mean it's like the it's like the winner's right history I mean that's it"
38:10;38:17;"yeah exactly I mean in classical is such a word that has the it's like classical"
38:17;38:22;"music has like this rev has this veneer of respectability yeah a positive"
38:22;38:32;"association officially sanctioned status or something and big slowdown"
38:33;38:39;"it's a cool flip on the classical meaning of classical yeah it's funny"
38:39;38:43;"like this song contains the word bleak and you said it was bleak and as I've"
38:43;38:47;"been doing press I've had more and more people like kind of saying that was this"
38:47;38:53;"album bleak and songs seem to paint like a kind of dark view of the world but you"
38:53;38:58;"know and I know the music doesn't know the music doesn't and also I know this"
38:58;39:01;"sounds like something that songwriters say just to like not have to be pinned"
39:01;39:08;"down but like in this song I think it's fairly obvious that there's like there's"
39:08;39:12;"both kind of like a person thinking something and there's like another voice"
39:12;39:18;"too like you know in that verse where there's the line a staircase up to"
39:18;39:21;"nothingness inside your DNA well that's a bleak sunrise which is in a way is"
39:21;39:26;"saying like if you accept that life is meaningless and you think that all we"
39:26;39:30;"are just a bunch of proteins that kind of randomly got thrown together by a"
39:30;39:36;"chaos you're gonna wake up every day to a bleak sunrise because it's all"
39:36;39:40;"meaningless you know if you if you have that feeling so I think ultimately this"
39:40;39:45;"this song is not endorsing that but it's a real feeling everybody has at times"
39:45;39:51;"and I like the fact that this song ended up being tracked to on the record and I"
39:51;39:55;"think was kind of important that some of these songs that talk about some bleak"
39:55;39:58;"stuff are like clustered around the beginning because ultimately the record"
39:58;40:03;"kind of goes on a journey and I don't necessarily endorse the belief that"
40:03;40:08;"just like well life is just harsh and the winner's right history and there's"
40:08;40:12;"nothing good about it. Of course not. Yeah but I think there you know but that's a"
40:12;40:15;"real thing that everybody feels every now and then so I think that's that's"
40:15;40:20;"kind of part of it and I think one thing I was thinking about recently is I was I"
40:20;40:25;"really like how the song has like a proper pre-chorus into the chorus the"
40:25;40:29;"pre-chorus being the untrue unkind and unnatural how the cruel time becomes"
40:29;40:33;"classical and then it picks up I know that wall is fall shake shake but I was"
40:33;40:41;"thinking about the um shake shack know that shake shack Burger King untrue"
40:41;40:45;"unkind and unnatural I think I like that that there's like kind of like it"
40:45;40:48;"reminded me like old-fashioned songwriting and there's this like old I"
40:48;40:53;"think Frank Sinatra did some versions of it a song called Bewitched, Bothered and"
40:53;40:58;"Bewildered. Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered. Yeah and I like that kind of"
40:58;41:03;"like old old-school songwriting where it's not like necessarily like a smart"
41:03;41:08;"Alec play on words but just a little bit of like alliteration a little bit of"
41:08;41:13;"like you know sticking on a theme. Well it's classical that came out a couple"
41:13;41:19;"weeks ago that was gonna be fun to play live good energy and then the one that"
41:19;41:25;"we just dropped the final little drop before the album which comes out this"
41:25;41:32;"week is uh Mary Boone. Have you ever played this for you Jake? No and I won't be"
41:32;41:37;"able to find the lyrics on Genius because it's not out yet."
41:37;41:40;"As we record this it's not out yet."
41:40;41:51;"Knew in time you were in Highland but I was looking in those days"
41:51;41:59;"My working day came in from Jersey not from Brooklyn"
41:59;42:09;"Oh my love was it all in vain? We always wanted money now the money's not the same"
42:09;42:15;"In a quiet moment at the theater I could hear the train"
42:15;42:19;"Deep inside the city your memory remains"
42:19;42:29;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, Smiled at the dark side of you"
42:29;42:38;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, Well I hope you feel like loving someone soon"
42:38;42:45;"Is this the first song about an art dealer ever?"
42:45;42:51;"It's certainly the first Vampire Weekend. I don't know, I don't think anybody ever..."
42:51;42:55;"Is that like a rap song called Gagosian?"
42:55;42:59;"The new turnstile song called David's Murder"
42:59;43:07;"Cookie cry, petty cop, not on the street yet"
43:07;43:14;"But it was cooking in those days, the burning veins"
43:14;43:20;"The one from Queens, not from Brooklyn"
43:20;43:30;"Oh my love was it all in vain? We always wanted money now the money's not the same"
43:30;43:35;"In a quiet moment at the theater I could feel your pain"
43:35;43:39;"Deep inside the city your memory remains"
43:39;43:49;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, I'm on the dark side of your room"
43:49;43:59;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, Well I hope you feel like loving someone soon"
43:59;44:07;"Wow, I love this one. Thanks."
44:07;44:11;"So what do you know about Mary Boone? Jake, obviously you're an artist."
44:11;44:14;"Did she go to jail for tax problems?"
44:14;44:19;"She went to jail for tax fraud. They let her out. She's under house arrest now."
44:19;44:24;"So she was a big art dealer. She was one of the hot shot dealers in the 80s."
44:24;44:29;"Russian icons and silent dollars and nights around the clock"
44:29;44:33;"These are the last lyrics I wrote for this album. It's the bridge."
44:33;44:38;"Armed with judges and wording dervishes"
44:38;44:45;"Long exposures in these two tunnels go west and east"
44:45;44:50;"Let me bring you my masterpiece"
44:50;44:55;"You're the author of everything"
44:55;45:00;"Use this voice and let it sing"
45:00;45:11;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, I'm on the dark side of your room"
45:11;45:20;"Mary Boone, Mary Boone, Well I hope you feel like loving someone soon"
45:20;45:26;"You saw Mary with a glass of wine in her hand at the reception. That's right."
45:26;45:35;"I mean, I saw some of the press you guys did."
45:35;45:41;"You were talking about the record being this like amalgam of like memories"
45:41;45:46;"or half forgotten memories of like New York from your childhood."
45:46;45:49;"20th century. 20th century New York. That's right."
45:49;45:56;"Which I was picturing you getting on a train in New Jersey, not Brooklyn"
45:56;46:01;"and going into Manhattan and like going to theater, going to see a gallery show."
46:01;46:07;"Yeah, I mean Mary Boone, she showed like, yeah, like some of the biggest, like Julian Schnabel, right?"
46:07;46:12;"And like David Sallie, I think. And would she have shown Basquiat or that was a..."
46:12;46:17;"I don't know who his major dealer was. Maybe."
46:17;46:21;"Yeah, it looks like Julian Schnabel was her big one."
46:21;46:26;"But yes, she also did deal with Basquiat."
46:26;46:33;"Yeah, all the big 80s, Eric Fischel, Enzo Kiefer, Barbara Kruger. Yeah, crazy."
46:33;46:34;"Yeah, major."
46:34;46:38;"She's like, yeah, like this Werner of the 80s, basically."
46:38;46:44;"That's, I saw that title and I was like, ooh, that's, that's a..."
46:44;46:48;"You have my attention, sir."
46:48;46:53;"I mean, yeah, you zeroed in on that line about came in from Jersey, not from Brooklyn."
46:53;47:00;"And like, yeah, when I've thought about is this song particularly about Mary Boone, the person, her life, her journey, whatever."
47:00;47:04;"Not really. The song is addressed to Mary Boone."
47:04;47:10;"I mean, I think I like the fact that she came from small town Pennsylvania and came to New York."
47:10;47:17;"She's a daughter of, I think, Egyptian immigrants, grew up in small town Pennsylvania, came to New York,"
47:17;47:22;"obviously became a huge deal in the New York art world."
47:22;47:27;"But I like the idea that, you know, this is about the next generation, maybe."
47:27;47:34;"I mean, when I picture these words, like the opening is painted white, new in town, you weren't hiring, but I was looking."
47:34;47:37;"Like, you know, it's what is a big city like New York?"
47:37;47:46;"It's wave after wave of ambitious people in various industries coming to, like, you know, make a name for themselves."
47:46;47:54;"And over and over again, the, you know, the tide, the waves keep crashing new people."
47:54;47:57;"Whether it's Steve Forbert or Mary Boone, I mean."
47:57;47:59;"That's right. Kind of similar era."
47:59;48:04;"And I like the idea of this person, the person who's like trying to get her attention."
48:04;48:07;"And maybe that maybe the weird linger."
48:07;48:11;"What was that lyric you had? Something, something, but you weren't hiring. What was the lyric?"
48:11;48:18;"Well, the opening of the song is painted white, new in town. You weren't hiring, but I was looking."
48:18;48:24;"Yeah, that reminds me of like so much of like being an artist or being interested in the art world."
48:24;48:30;"But it's such a it's such an impenetrable kind of opaque world, especially when you're young."
48:30;48:34;"And you don't know anyone in it and you kind of go into these big, like."
48:34;48:38;"Fancy, like cavernous galleries in New York."
48:38;48:45;"And there's the people like working there at the desk have such like severe kind of intense body language."
48:45;48:50;"And you're just like, can I even say hi? Like, how does this work?"
48:50;48:53;"I feel so intimidated by this whole thing."
48:53;49:01;"And even when you see those people, let alone these like really intense gallerist, but even just the people working the front desk or something."
49:01;49:10;"The idea that maybe they're from like a small town in Connecticut or Massachusetts, you know, it's just like there's very little trace left of that."
49:10;49:17;"Whatever previous life they had, because, you know, in the New York art world, you have to, you kind of have to be some type of character."
49:17;49:22;"You at least have to get with the program. Yeah. And it's can be extremely highbrow."
49:22;49:26;"Yeah. So there's definitely some, I think the song has some like tri-state energy."
49:26;49:31;"And as of recording this, we still haven't even finished the visual that's going to go along with it."
49:31;49:38;"It's not a proper music video, like classical, but the image I kept coming back to."
49:38;49:46;"Because, you know, sometimes you have to just come up with like a visual to go on YouTube or any type of social media."
49:46;49:51;"And then when I was trying to just like drill down on like the visual and I talked about this quite a bit with Nick."
49:51;50:01;"He helped me kick around ideas. And one thing I kept coming back to, if I just had to boil down one image of something in the real world that represented this song,"
50:01;50:08;"I just kept coming back to going through the Lincoln Tunnel. And at some point I had more ambitious ideas."
50:08;50:14;"I was pitching to Nick a full reverse Sopranos, where I was like, all right, picture this."
50:14;50:20;"I walk out in front of the Sopranos house, Despot picks me up and then we drive backwards through the Sopranos opening credits."
50:20;50:22;"And it ends with us going into the tunnel."
50:22;50:26;"Instead of lighting a cigar, you're hitting the vape pen."
50:26;50:33;"Yeah, I'm hitting a vape pen. Because as any Sopranos fan knows, the beginning of the Sopranos opening credits is Tony exiting the Lincoln Tunnel."
50:33;50:39;"Got you all set off a gun. That seemed a little bit too ambitious."
50:39;50:42;"That's a funny cut."
50:42;50:45;"Yeah, we'll do that one day. We'll do something else."
50:45;50:50;"But then I just kept coming back to like somebody just going into the Lincoln Tunnel."
50:50;50:59;"And I believe, even though I haven't seen the final footage, what we ended up with was Despot driving into the Lincoln Tunnel."
50:59;51:00;"Nice."
51:00;51:04;"And I think for people, I guess maybe not for you, Jake, because when you're coming in from Connecticut."
51:04;51:05;"No tunnels."
51:05;51:09;"You're taking the Throgs Neck Bridge or the Triborough or what?"
51:09;51:11;"I'm trying to remember."
51:11;51:13;"Were you like driving through the Bronx basically?"
51:13;51:19;"Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's yeah, exactly. Drive by Yankee Stadium and then down through Harlem, basically."
51:19;51:21;"Right. Your bridge guy."
51:21;51:25;"The one we were talking about, I did that drive a lot into the Lincoln Tunnel."
51:25;51:31;"It is, you know, every turn when you talked about the memory, like Jake was bringing up this, this idea of memories."
51:31;51:38;"There's something about entering the tunnel and knowing every turn in it coming up and knowing how long you're underneath the tunnel."
51:38;51:45;"I mean, it's fairly iconic, so much so that as we talked about, a lot of people film themselves going into the Lincoln Tunnel."
51:45;51:47;"Right, I bet you had a lot of that on YouTube."
51:47;51:48;"Yeah, a lot of that on YouTube."
51:48;51:55;"We actually licensed some film from a YouTuber named Frank Palmisano based in Binghamton, New York."
51:55;52:01;"And again, at the time of recording this, I believe we filmed our own version to make it a little more specific."
52:01;52:07;"But we did license this footage from Frank, which was great, which was him driving through, I think, a couple of years ago."
52:07;52:10;"And I mean, it's such an engineering marvel."
52:10;52:17;"But what I always loved about it too is like you're kind of heading towards the city and then you just do this loop and head down."
52:17;52:23;"And you catch a little glimpse of the New York skyline as you're looping down towards the tunnel."
52:23;52:29;"And then there's this moment too when you're down in this kind of valley, which is the entrance to the tunnel."
52:29;52:32;"And you look up and you realize you're surrounded by cliffs."
52:32;52:47;"They're these like houses that are maybe 200 feet above you because that part of New Jersey is like it's like the highlands, you know, like Weehawken and all these towns
are built into kind of like these like rocks, these bluffs kind of overlooking the Hudson River."
52:47;52:54;"And then so you wind down and then you go into the tunnel and then it's amazing, you know, like you're you don't want to think about it too much."
52:54;52:56;"But you're when was that built?"
52:56;52:59;"A hundred plus years ago?"
52:59;53:00;"This always blows my mind."
53:00;53:02;"How did they do it?"
53:02;53:03;"That's crazy."
53:03;53:04;"I always look at this stuff."
53:04;53:07;"I always ask my dad because, you know, my dad was studied mine engineering."
53:07;53:10;"He ended up being his 1934."
53:10;53:12;"Literally a hundred years ago."
53:12;53:13;"Yeah."
53:13;53:15;"It opened in 37."
53:15;53:17;"By the way, that's insane."
53:17;53:19;"It was a four."
53:19;53:21;"I mean, that just seems like it should take so much longer."
53:21;53:26;"It's the construction started in 34 and it opened in 37."
53:26;53:27;"Wow."
53:27;53:28;"Today would take 20 years."
53:28;53:29;"Oh, yeah."
53:29;53:34;"I don't ever want to feel like I did that day."
53:34;53:38;"Take me to the place I love."
53:38;53:40;"Take me all the way."
53:40;53:45;"I don't ever want to feel like I did that day."
53:45;53:49;"Take me to the place I love."
53:49;53:51;"Take me all the way."
53:51;53:57;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:57;54:02;"Oh, no, no, no, yeah, yeah."
54:02;54:08;"Love me that day, yeah, yeah."
54:08;54:13;"One more time."
54:13;54:16;"Go to the red showtown."
54:16;54:19;"It's where I'm really so glad."
54:19;54:22;"Go to the red showtown."
54:22;54:24;"I could not get enough."
54:24;54:27;"Go to the red showtown."
54:27;54:30;"Forgot about my love."
54:30;54:33;"Go to the red showtown."
54:33;54:36;"I gave my life away."
54:36;54:37;"I don't make them like I used to."
54:37;54:40;"Imagine all that red tape trying to build a tunnel."
54:40;54:44;"So, were you telling me, me and my friends, we want to build a tunnel?"
54:44;54:47;"And we got to deal with all this red tape?"
54:47;54:50;"And all these woke kids, too, huh?"
54:50;54:55;"The cranky old man podcast."
54:55;54:57;"Talking about governmental red tape."
54:57;54:59;"Club Random."
54:59;55:00;"Oh, yeah, dude."
55:00;55:04;"Asked one of the young guys if he can hold the drill."
55:04;55:07;"And he says--"
55:07;55:08;"He has an anxiety attack."
55:08;55:09;"Yeah, he has an anxiety attack."
55:09;55:11;"Goes home for three months."
55:11;55:14;"We're building a tunnel here."
55:14;55:18;"I remember a few weeks ago, we were talking about Ezra making podcast appearances."
55:18;55:21;"And I was really pushing hard for Ezra trying to get on Club Random."
55:21;55:23;"Oh, maybe I should."
55:23;55:25;"See, I'm coming on Club Random."
55:25;55:31;"Bill, I'm coming on Club Random, but I only want to talk about how difficult it would be to build the Lincoln Tunnel today."
55:31;55:37;"Oh, I love that."
55:37;55:39;"That's catnip for Bill."
55:39;55:40;"That is catnip."
55:40;55:42;"But also, I know there's an easy answer."
55:42;55:43;"And even think about it."
55:43;55:46;"They built the Brooklyn Bridge in the 19th century."
55:46;55:47;"Yeah."
55:47;55:50;"I know it involves caissons."
55:50;55:54;"But let's just logically think about it."
55:54;55:55;"We get the Crisis crew."
55:55;55:57;"We get the Vampire Campfire crew."
55:57;55:59;"We get you guys, the Lunch Pail Boys."
55:59;56:01;"All the crews unite."
56:01;56:04;"We get the guys from Richard Pictures."
56:04;56:06;"Maybe some of our old friends from high school."
56:06;56:09;"We get together like a dream team of about 100 guys."
56:09;56:13;"And women."
56:13;56:20;"And we say, ""All right, we're going to build a tunnel underneath the Hudson River."""
56:20;56:29;"I mean, look, I feel like if you gave me 100 people and said, ""Build a house,"" we could probably figure out how to build a house."
56:29;56:32;"It might not last forever, but we could build a dwelling."
56:32;56:33;"Yeah."
56:33;56:40;"If you got 100 people, even great painters and musicians, and said, ""All right, guys, build the Lincoln Tunnel."""
56:40;56:41;"Where do we even start with that?"
56:41;56:44;"Even if they said, ""Okay, guys, how about this? Build the Brooklyn Bridge."""
56:44;56:47;"You have all the time you need, all the materials you need."
56:47;56:49;"How do we do that?"
56:49;56:51;"I have no idea."
56:51;56:52;"How, Sway?"
56:52;56:54;"Nick, how do you build that?"
56:54;56:56;"I'm getting nauseous just thinking about it."
56:56;56:57;"No, the first step."
56:57;56:58;"Listen."
56:58;57:00;"What's the first step?"
57:00;57:01;"This is it."
57:01;57:02;"This is for all the marbles."
57:02;57:04;"What's out the tape measure?"
57:04;57:06;"Okay, how wide is the river?"
57:06;57:07;"All right, Jake."
57:07;57:09;"Jake, you have unlimited resources."
57:09;57:12;"You have all the manpower you need, everything you need."
57:12;57:14;"And this is going to save America."
57:14;57:18;"All you need to do is just be in charge of this plan to build the Brooklyn Bridge."
57:18;57:20;"We got all the stone you need."
57:20;57:23;"We got thousands of Irish and Italian immigrants."
57:23;57:25;"How do you do it?"
57:25;57:26;"This is step one."
57:26;57:28;"This is the first TC reality show."
57:28;57:36;"I think we're going to get a bunch of Gen Z together, and we're going to give them unlimited resources, but they have to build it."
57:36;57:37;"The Brooklyn Bridge."
57:37;57:39;"They have to build the Brooklyn Bridge."
57:39;57:43;"But it's like they have to build the Brooklyn Bridge, and they're like, ""Where?"""
57:43;57:48;"You're just like, ""Across this random lake in Wisconsin."""
57:48;58:02;"It has to be like about a one to four ratio model of the Brooklyn Bridge across a lake that we bought in rural Wisconsin."
58:02;58:06;"And is the concept that no one has any engineering training?"
58:06;58:13;"Or could we hire a 26-year-old person who just got out of engineering school?"
58:13;58:15;"And by the way, I want to be clear about something."
58:15;58:18;"I'm not ragging on millennials or Gen Z."
58:18;58:24;"What I'm saying is I just want everybody to think about this."
58:24;58:26;"I'm not saying this to diss the young generation."
58:26;58:28;"I'm saying this to praise."
58:28;58:31;"I come here not to diss the Zoomers."
58:31;58:36;"I come here to praise whoever it was that did these things."
58:36;58:37;"The greatest generation."
58:37;58:39;"I mean, and Brooklyn Bridge is even before the greatest generation."
58:39;58:41;"1870."
58:41;58:43;"It was like Civil War veterans."
58:43;58:47;"It was 1870, and it took 13 years."
58:47;58:49;"I think it finished in '83."
58:49;58:53;"All I'm saying is I just want everybody at home to think about this."
58:53;58:54;"You."
58:54;58:58;"Maybe your TC listeners span the generation."
58:58;59:03;"So whatever generation you are, all I'm saying is you're in charge of this one project."
59:03;59:07;"You have the rest of your life to do it, and you have unlimited resources and manpower."
59:07;59:11;"All you need to do is tell me, how do you make that bridge?"
59:11;59:16;"How do you put those feet down at the bottom of the river?"
59:16;59:19;"Because you can't try out the river."
59:19;59:20;"That's not going to work."
59:20;59:21;"You can't try out the Hudson River."
59:21;59:30;"You need to devise a system to build a stable, giant pillar that goes to the seabed of the Hudson River."
59:30;59:33;"I'm sorry, the Brooklyn Bridge would be the East River."
59:33;59:35;"But how do you do that?"
59:35;59:36;"Step one."
59:36;59:38;"You've got to build a moat around that, basically."
59:38;59:40;"And I think that's essentially how you do it."
59:40;59:41;"I've seen that."
59:41;59:45;"Where they build a circular structure."
59:45;59:47;"Like a giant bucket."
59:47;59:49;"And they pump the water out."
59:49;59:50;"So it's a dry circle."
59:50;59:52;"How do you even start with that?"
59:52;59:53;"1870."
59:53;59:56;"You're sending divers down to the bottom?"
59:56;59:58;"How deep is the East River?"
59:58;01:00:02;"You know what my take of how they built the Brooklyn Bridge in 1870?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"What's that?"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Ancient aliens."
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Because it just doesn't add up."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"They had to have been helped by aliens."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"Okay, well after you go on Club Random, you're going on Rogan."
01:00:14;01:00:19;"Joe, I'm here to tell you that everything we know about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge is nonsense."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"It doesn't add up."
01:00:21;01:00:26;"We sailed away on a winter's day"
01:00:26;01:00:31;"With fate as malleable as clay"
01:00:31;01:00:36;"But ships are fallible, I say"
01:00:36;01:00:41;"And the nautical like all things fades"
01:00:41;01:00:46;"And I can recall our caravel"
01:00:46;01:00:51;"A little wicker beetle shell"
01:00:51;01:00:56;"With four fine mouths and lateen sails"
01:00:56;01:01:01;"Its bearings on Cap Harrival"
01:01:01;01:01:09;"Oh my love, oh it was a funny little thing"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Alright, Jay, can you introduce our next guest?"
01:01:11;01:01:23;"Yes, our next guest is Lance Oppenheim, a filmmaker, a documentarian, who has a new movie coming out on FX and Hulu."
01:01:23;01:01:27;"I think today, the day this is airing, called Sperm World."
01:01:27;01:01:32;"It's about people, basically IVF, fertilization treatment is incredibly expensive."
01:01:32;01:01:47;"So this is about people online who meet each other and exchange biological material with the hopes of making a child."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"With a turkey-based tupperware."
01:01:49;01:01:59;"We've all seen Lance's, was this his first feature doc? Some Kind of Heaven, which is a great documentary about a retirement community called The Villages in Florida."
01:01:59;01:02:02;"Which I think is the biggest retirement community in America."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"Yeah, that was a movie that came out a few years ago and I loved that movie."
01:02:05;01:02:10;"And actually at the time I remember thinking, we should have Lance on TC."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"And then he actually reached out to me."
01:02:13;01:02:19;"We had emailed a few times in the previous years and then he reached out to me when Sperm World was done."
01:02:19;01:02:24;"And I actually ended up doing a painting for the promotion of the movie."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"It was a weird commission for me. I rarely do commissions, but."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"Explain that. What did you paint?"
01:02:29;01:02:36;"He gave me a bunch of stills from the movie of people meeting in parking lots with tupperwares full of biological material."
01:02:36;01:02:44;"But he was really nice about it. He said, your work really impacted how me and the cinematographer shot the film."
01:02:44;01:02:54;"Because a lot of the film takes place in parking lots of an old Sears building or an old Best Buy or something."
01:02:54;01:02:58;"So it's definitely up my alley in terms of my own artistic interests."
01:02:58;01:03:06;"And he was just like, yeah, like your palette and like the tone of your paintings really like impacted the aesthetic of the doc."
01:03:06;01:03:17;"Which is very flattering. And then he was like, maybe we can figure out a way that you can like make a painting based on the movie that FX could use to promote the doc."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I love that."
01:03:18;01:03:22;"So I made a small painting. They're using this part of the promo for the movie."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"It was a fun project. I don't usually do that kind of thing."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Yeah. Love that."
01:03:26;01:03:33;"So I've gotten to know Lance pretty well over the last few months because we've been back and forth on this a lot."
01:03:33;01:03:41;"And also I have to say, we have a TC bombshell that I'm going to unload on you guys."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"Wow. Let's get Lance Oppenheim on the horn."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Hey."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Lance, what's up? Welcome to Time Crisis."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Wow."
01:03:54;01:04:01;"Lance, I was just teeing you up a little bit, telling the story about me doing the painting for your Respirm World."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"And we were talking about some kind of heaven and stuff."
01:04:03;01:04:09;"But then I did say that you have a major Time Crisis bombshell that I needed to address right at the top."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"I was talking to Lance this morning and somehow this came up."
01:04:13;01:04:18;"He's met Richard Montanez."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"I did."
01:04:20;01:04:24;"Not only that, the fire inside."
01:04:24;01:04:30;"I believe my publicist helped that song get an Oscar nomination."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"That's the first thing I heard."
01:05:34;01:05:38;"I met Mr. I don't think he'll remember me, Mr. Montanez."
01:05:38;01:05:46;"I was in college. He came for a conversation about how he did what he did."
01:05:46;01:05:49;"And I was telling Jake, I'm not sure."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"I kind of partially believe it."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"He seemed like a very nice guy."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"But you know, it was interesting."
01:05:57;01:06:02;"It was half talk, half there was a lot of promotion for the fact that the movie was about to be made."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"So there was a lot of excitement."
01:06:04;01:06:07;"Lance, you're pretty young. You were in college recently?"
01:06:07;01:06:10;"This is like 2018, 2018, 2019 around there."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"They'd already announced it that they were making the film."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Yes."
01:06:14;01:06:17;"Yes. And he came to, I went to Harvard."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"So he came to, he went there and he gave a speech."
01:06:20;01:06:25;"And I remember there was a lot of, you know, it was a motivational talk."
01:06:25;01:06:30;"Right before this happened, it was kind of a nice palate cleanser in a way."
01:06:30;01:06:36;"Because there was a guy, the speaker before him in the same auditorium at Sanders Hall."
01:06:36;01:06:44;"There was a guy who was talking, preaching about getting his, you know, like surgically reattaching his foreskin."
01:06:44;01:06:49;"And he was forcibly removed from Sanders Hall for doing so."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"There was just like this massive, strange."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"And he was the opener for Richard Montanya's creator of Hot Cheetos."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"What the hell is going on with our crib?"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"Not the opener. This was like several months before."
01:06:59;01:07:03;"It was called Sex and Circumcision, an American Love Story."
01:07:03;01:07:07;"And I remember this was like, there was a lot of controversy."
01:07:07;01:07:14;"Like how did this guy who seemingly, you know, had maybe, I thought it was pretty interesting."
01:07:14;01:07:17;"But a lot of people felt like it was offensive and insulting."
01:07:17;01:07:22;"So the question was how did this guy hijack, you know, this really big auditorium?"
01:07:22;01:07:27;"And so anyway, that happened. And then like a few months later, Richard, you know, came."
01:07:27;01:07:30;"How are these talks promoted? Is this mandatory?"
01:07:30;01:07:36;"Or is this just for students who are studying kind of corn-based snack products?"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"Yeah, it's, they force you to show up."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"They bribe you with tons of different Cheetos and different things."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"And if you don't go, they will assassinate you."
01:07:46;01:07:50;"You know, it was, you know, it was a sign up kind of optional."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"You get to go if you want to see something interesting."
01:07:52;01:07:57;"So you're just a college student and you said, do you want to meet the guy who claims to have invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"Yeah."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"And you said, yeah, sure. Sign me up."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Yeah. I shook his hand. I didn't really have much of a conversation."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"I just kind of thought the whole thing was interesting."
01:08:05;01:08:10;"You know, and he, this was a few, I don't know if he still does this. I imagine he does."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"But, you know, I did."
01:08:11;01:08:16;"Did it cross your mind to ask him if he wanted to do a documentary with you?"
01:08:16;01:08:20;"I honestly should have thought about that."
01:08:20;01:08:26;"But, you know, they already, I already kind of figured this guy was, he had his movie that was, he was promoting."
01:08:26;01:08:30;"And then I guess two years after that, there was the whole controversy."
01:08:30;01:08:35;"And I, you know, I wasn't surprised, whichever way it turned."
01:08:35;01:08:38;"You were saying that you were pretty skeptical of his story."
01:08:38;01:08:42;"I will say, I think it still would be pretty cool to do."
01:08:42;01:08:48;"And Time Crisis, we've talked about getting into the documentary producing business."
01:08:48;01:08:54;"We might have to ask you a few questions, but we could commission you to do."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"Okay. You've seen Flamin' Hot. You've listened to the fire inside."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"You've maybe read Richard Montanez's book."
01:09:00;01:09:05;"But how about we make a documentary that tells the whole story about the whole thing?"
01:09:05;01:09:09;"The making of the movie, the real Richard Montanez story."
01:09:09;01:09:13;"You interview the guy at the LA Times who tried to take him down."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"We'll get President Biden on the horn."
01:09:15;01:09:19;"Why didn't you invite Montanez to the White House presidential screening of Flamin' Hot?"
01:09:19;01:09:25;"You can interview Eva Longoria, everybody involved in the whole story."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"That's what the world needs. And you seem like an even-handed guy."
01:09:28;01:09:33;"And I think the fact that you and Montanez have some history would probably help you sell him on the fact that,"
01:09:33;01:09:37;"""Listen, I'm not the LA Times guy. I have no interest in taking you down."""
01:09:37;01:09:42;"I think this might be an interesting, complicated story about ownership,"
01:09:42;01:09:47;"the birth of Hispanic marketing in the gringo world, all that kind of..."
01:09:47;01:09:51;"You know what I mean? To be fair, this is going to take the next 10 years of your life."
01:09:51;01:09:55;"But this is going to be something where you look at it from all angles."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"And that's what the TC community needs."
01:09:57;01:10:02;"I think I have you covered, man. Because I am ready."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"I think my whole career has led to this point."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"I've been waiting for this opportunity."
01:10:07;01:10:13;"It's interesting. I'm curious. Was he on set when they made the movie?"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Was he there?"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"That's what's so crazy. I feel like they were in the..."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"He does have a cameo in it."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"Oh yeah, he has a cameo."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"When they're giving out Flamin' Hot Cheetos at the park."
01:10:23;01:10:26;"Was he consulting? Because sometimes I'm curious about that."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"Do you guys know this filmmaker, Ross McElwee?"
01:10:29;01:10:32;"He made this movie called Sherman's March a long time ago."
01:10:32;01:10:42;"There was a film that was in the works for a while that was basically about Hollywood's attempts to remake that movie."
01:10:42;01:10:50;"And he agreed to let them pursue it if they let him film all the behind the scenes stuff."
01:10:50;01:10:51;"The making of."
01:10:51;01:10:55;"And so he was interviewing people that were pretending to be him."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"Women, the premise of that movie."
01:10:57;01:11:02;"He's going and meeting women, ex-girlfriends."
01:11:02;01:11:08;"He's trying to figure out some sort of link between his life and General Sherman."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"But anyway, I'm always curious about that."
01:11:10;01:11:17;"How does someone feel when the movie is ostensibly about their lives is being made?"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"And the creative liberties that are taken."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"I bet he probably felt pretty good about the movie."
01:11:22;01:11:26;"I'm sure he felt weird about not getting invited to the White House screening."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"And this is what we got to find out."
01:11:29;01:11:36;"What happened in that period when the LA Times come in after him and the movie."
01:11:36;01:11:39;"It's a real crazy confluence of events."
01:11:39;01:11:44;"But your new feature is called Sperm World."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"And so yours is inspired."
01:11:46;01:11:53;"Is it fair to say based on a New York Times article called The Sperm Kings Have a Problem Too Much Demand."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"And so this documentary is produced by the New York Times."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"What does that mean?"
01:11:58;01:12:03;"Well, it means that Richard Montanez was running the show all along."
01:12:03;01:12:10;"Because he is he's left behind his old life and now he works at the New York Times."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"I wish that would be cool."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"Right."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"If I can work with him."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"He commissioned the movie."
01:12:15;01:12:22;"This is sort of a sort of aspirational sequel to his book."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"No, I don't know."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"You know, it's interesting."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"I've made a lot of films with the New York Times."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"That's kind of where I started."
01:12:29;01:12:36;"They used to do this thing and they still do called the Op Docs, which is it's like opinion op eds documentaries."
01:12:36;01:12:45;"And so independent filmmakers, you know, would they make these movies and you try and hope for the outlets to pick it up and get it out there."
01:12:45;01:12:46;"And so that's what I started doing."
01:12:46;01:12:52;"I used to spam email them because I was hoping that they would take my stuff."
01:12:52;01:12:59;"And then I got to know the people there and one of the executives kind of advanced and runs the TV and movie division."
01:12:59;01:13:02;"It's interesting, though, you know, I mean, the movies I make, I'm not like a journalist."
01:13:02;01:13:09;"Right. And I've always sort of subscribed more to the idea that like nonfiction storytelling, not just filmmaking."
01:13:09;01:13:20;"It's like it's about, you know, the creative treatments of reality, which probably, you know, if you're looking back at your friend Richard, it's probably a good his
book is he's probably treating it the same way."
01:13:20;01:13:27;"And even the movie, even though it's not nonfiction, I'm taking this very seriously here, you know, trying to draw these links."
01:13:27;01:13:34;"To be fair, the I'm sure for Richard Montanyez and after that, we can talk about your new movie."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"We got to get to the origins of the claim."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"But obviously, this is a phrase Jake uses a lot."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"I don't know where who kind of popularized it, but is emotional truth."
01:13:44;01:13:57;"Obviously, Richard Montanyez, one thing we know for sure about him is that he went from being a janitor at Frito-Lay to being a high level marketing executive."
01:13:57;01:14:03;"We know that's true. Did he do it because he and he alone invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos?"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"That's what's being called into question."
01:14:05;01:14:14;"No matter what, he did something pretty remarkable, especially for a guy from his background at that time."
01:14:14;01:14:29;"So did he embellish a very real story of personal triumph because, you know, he bent reality a little bit to fit something very real?"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"To fit an emotional truth."
01:14:31;01:14:44;"To fit an emotional truth, which is did I play a gigantic role in getting Frito-Lay, a gringo company, to make products for the community that I come from?"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"He did."
01:14:45;01:14:56;"Now, did he do that through a million paper cuts by little by little saying, you know, I think it might be nice if you marketed this product this way or I think you're
missing out."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"You know, was it like that?"
01:14:57;01:15:01;"That's a hard story to tell. So maybe just say I invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:15:01;01:15:05;"Yeah. And maybe the truth is somewhere in between, you know."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"That's why we need this dot."
01:15:07;01:15:17;"We'll find the answers one way. Maybe if you watch the movie Sperm Worlds, there's subliminal truths that can come to you."
01:15:17;01:15:32;"I just hope one day, 10 years from now, when this 20-part series is done, you're sitting with Bill Maher on Club Random and he's looking at his notes and he says,
""Produced by Time Crisis."" What does that mean?"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"Okay, so tell us about Sperm Worlds."
01:15:34;01:15:42;"Yeah, well, you know, look, it's interesting. I feel like the difference between Time Crisis producing a documentary and the New York Times producing a documentary."
01:15:42;01:15:54;"I mean, it doesn't take that much these days to produce something except for being very emotionally available to a neurotic filmmaker, maybe."
01:15:54;01:15:59;"And we pay for your gas and get you the Chipotle gift card?"
01:15:59;01:16:09;"Yes. Ideally, a Subway gift card because that's where Taco Bell preferably is another place I like to eat when I'm shooting late in the night."
01:16:09;01:16:16;"But, you know, this is a movie I got to know this reporter, Nellie Bowles. She wrote this article."
01:16:16;01:16:20;"And I made another movie, my first feature-length film I made with the New York Times."
01:16:20;01:16:28;"And they were sort of tangentially involved, but they gave a lot of kind of early money because I thought it was going to be a short documentary."
01:16:28;01:16:32;"And then it kind of became something bigger and longer."
01:16:32;01:16:37;"And this one, in this case, I knew a journalist. She sent me this sort of the world."
01:16:37;01:16:44;"She showed me this whole universe of people finding each other on these, you know, Facebook groups."
01:16:44;01:16:49;"And these people were meeting on these groups for sperm."
01:16:49;01:16:54;"There were men that were advertising their services for little to no money."
01:16:54;01:16:58;"You know, these were completely all this stuff was unregulated."
01:16:58;01:17:05;"You had people meeting outside of sperm banks. You had women that had tried to go to a sperm bank and maybe it didn't work for some reason."
01:17:05;01:17:13;"Or, you know, maybe they opted intentionally to go on these Facebook groups to meet their donor."
01:17:13;01:17:21;"And I just kind of I started looking at these posts and I just was like, what a fascinating blend of things going on."
01:17:21;01:17:30;"You have people, women that are posting these like really emotional, really intimate stories about their trials and tribulations to having a child."
01:17:30;01:17:38;"And then you have a guy that's, you know, responding by giving a thumbs up and then commenting, I'm available, you know, and then that was it."
01:17:38;01:17:45;"They meet up in a motel room somewhere. How does it work? Is there any blueprint for this? No."
01:17:45;01:17:52;"So, you know, for me, I just was like, OK, as a filmmaker, I'd love to just understand."
01:17:52;01:18:03;"First off, just be like with these people while they're making these choices and kind of fumbling towards this common desire of having a child."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"And then it kind of, you know, turned into something else from there."
01:18:06;01:18:13;"And so the people who who are meeting in parking lots with sperm donors, they could be anybody."
01:18:13;01:18:22;"They could be an infertile couple, a single women, couples where nobody produces sperm."
01:18:22;01:18:28;"Like, is it anything under the sun or is there like a typical profile for the sperm recipient?"
01:18:28;01:18:36;"No, it can be kind of anything. I mean, I would say it's mostly, you know, queer women that are in like same sex relationships."
01:18:36;01:18:41;"But there's transgender folks. There's yeah, like you're saying infertile dudes."
01:18:41;01:18:48;"But, you know, in the case of the film, I ended up sort of focusing on there's two women that are in the movie."
01:18:48;01:18:56;"One of them is has cystic fibrosis. And then, you know, she's it's basically in some ways kind of a death wish."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"Where the only thing that's giving her life is the desire to be pregnant. Right."
01:19:00;01:19:06;"And so she's she's pursuing that, even though everyone in her life is saying don't do it."
01:19:06;01:19:11;"And so she's kind of created this very lonely existence where, you know, she has a few friends."
01:19:11;01:19:22;"But for the most part, the only person that becomes relatively close to her in this kind of ambiguously defined relationship is her sperm donor, who's like three times
her age."
01:19:22;01:19:39;"But, you know, that's really I don't know. To me, the movie ended up becoming something that's much more about like it's like this kind of existential, you know, road
movie or something where it's about people that are just trying to figure out why they're on Earth."
01:19:39;01:19:44;"What is it that they're here to do? You know, what gives them meaning in their lives?"
01:19:45;01:19:49;"Show me the meaning of the word."
01:19:49;01:19:56;"Show me the meaning of the word."
01:19:56;01:20:03;"Because I've heard so much about it."
01:20:03;01:20:10;"They say you can't live without it."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"And."
01:20:13;01:20:20;"Welcome to the human race."
01:20:20;01:20:39;"I think a lot of these people, you know, don't really know they found themselves in a point in their lives where they're whatever they were doing before they started
sperm donating or before they started trying to have a child kind of led them to this place, this this this asterisk mark or question mark where they didn't they didn't
know where things were going."
01:20:39;01:20:44;"And so that's kind of that's where we find them. We find them at this kind of crossroads."
01:20:44;01:20:49;"And it's all done in an incredibly strong visual style."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"That's very, very like my plants."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"So Lance's first film, I was immediately struck by that."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"And it continued it with this one where it's just like it's unusually beautiful for a documentary."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"It's very cinematic, very filmic."
01:21:03;01:21:11;"So I think that adds like a real kind of emotional anchor to the whole thing."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Well, thanks."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"So it's funny."
01:21:13;01:21:16;"You know, I told this to Jake the first time I emailed him."
01:21:16;01:21:27;"But so much of the movie, the aesthetic and, you know, the places where people were meeting one another, they all kind of I was looking at his paintings like all the time."
01:21:27;01:21:39;"You know, I was obsessed with the Hooters and one that the empty Toys R Us because a lot of these places that people were meeting each other were like long Stratheon
vistas."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Hey, boom, done."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"That's I should have put that in the first email I wrote to Jake."
01:21:44;01:21:50;"But yeah, they were. I mean, really, it was sort of like these places that look totally familiar by day."
01:21:50;01:21:57;"And then, you know, by sunset and by night, they just become totally foreign and alien."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"And yeah, it's a yeah, it's a beautiful movie."
01:22:01;01:22:06;"The thing that really like like the question I had after watching this thing was not so much the women."
01:22:06;01:22:09;"I understood their their impulses."
01:22:09;01:22:18;"It was the guys, the donors that were like those guys were just complete kind of black holes of like of mystery to me."
01:22:18;01:22:23;"Like what is what what is driving these guys, these men?"
01:22:23;01:22:33;"Well, it's funny because some people, you know, there's a school of thought where people think everything all human society is just driven by these like evolutionary
impulses."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Yeah."
01:22:34;01:22:38;"And you know how many times you heard somebody talk about some spreading their seed?"
01:22:38;01:22:42;"Just that male, that male impulse to spread their seed."
01:22:42;01:22:46;"Like 5% of the world is the descendants of Genghis Khan."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"Genghis Khan, right."
01:22:48;01:22:57;"Yeah, it's interesting. You know, I feel like in a way it's like these the men in the movie, I think there's a part of them that has that that have that idea in the back of
their minds."
01:22:57;01:23:02;"But I do think it's a lot deeper than that and a lot more emotionally complicated."
01:23:02;01:23:11;"I think it's almost this like, you know, it reminds me a lot of like you ever see Bringing Out the Dead, the Scorsese, Nicolas Cage movie where Cage plays again."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"Love that movie."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"So good, right? It's amazing flick."
01:23:14;01:23:19;"It all takes place at night, just like freaky New York hospital paramedic world."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"It's like in-"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Hell's Kitchen."
01:23:21;01:23:27;"Yeah, and the guys in that movie or, you know, Cage in that movie, it's like, it's this almost selfish desire."
01:23:27;01:23:36;"He's like, I must save someone's life, not because I'm saving their lives, but because I need that feeling. I need that. I need that rush."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"That purpose."
01:23:37;01:23:55;"So I think, you know, for most of these guys, I mean, there's a guy who's in the movie who's like in his mid-60s and he's divorced and he's beginning, you know, we're
meeting him at the start of this, of his hobby that becomes a lot more maybe integral to his personality, his life."
01:23:55;01:24:03;"And there's a guy who's sort of in his like mid-career level, you know, form as a donor, you know, and he charges a little bit, but not that much."
01:24:03;01:24:10;"And then there's a guy who's trying to quit, but he's been, you know, doing it for a while and he has like 170 children."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"Is that Ari?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"That's Ari. Yeah."
01:24:13;01:24:18;"And so, you know, there's like these three tiers of people doing this."
01:24:18;01:24:26;"And I think it's like, in a way, they're all longing for something. It's not quite, and I think it's like this completely unrequited feeling."
01:24:26;01:24:31;"And you see it, you see it in the groups, because in these Facebook groups, you see it all the time."
01:24:31;01:24:37;"You see the women, they come in, they either get pregnant, they leave, or they don't and they still leave."
01:24:37;01:24:48;"And the men kind of remain there fulfilling other people's desires, but kind of remaining in this sort of purgatorial, like, you know, limbo, neutral gear universe."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Yeah."
01:24:50;01:24:55;"You know, I do, it's really cool, like, for a doc to be so ambiguous."
01:24:55;01:25:02;"You're really like on the ride with these guys and, and it's, but there's, yeah, there are no clear answers on what drives these guys."
01:25:02;01:25:09;"I mean, the Ari character, like you were saying, he's in this like weird limbo state, like he'll go and visit."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"This is one scene that I always think about."
01:25:11;01:25:16;"He goes and visits some of his kids, you know, that he sees once a year."
01:25:16;01:25:24;"And then like the final shot of that sequence is like him just like bunking down for the night on like the family's couch."
01:25:24;01:25:28;"It's just like, oh yeah, I mean, you know, it's just so weird."
01:25:28;01:25:35;"Like daddy's here and then like, and then he like leaves the next day and goes, he's like another family he co-created."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"Yeah, I mean, he lives his life."
01:25:36;01:25:44;"It's like Warren Beatty and shampoo, you know, that's, that's the thing that kind of drew me to him where he's just, it's like this merry-go-round."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"He doesn't have a home really."
01:25:46;01:25:57;"He teaches math at a community college in New York, but he's been sued so many times for child support and he's garnered so much of his wages that he, you know."
01:25:57;01:26:02;"Oh, by people who ostensibly just wanted his sperm and then they'd sue him?"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Yes, yes."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Oh boy."
01:26:04;01:26:10;"And so, you know, he doesn't, he claims he doesn't have enough resources to really get his own place."
01:26:10;01:26:14;"So what ends up happening is he just kind of, you know, but it's also a choice."
01:26:14;01:26:20;"Like he, what ends up happening is he goes and he spends every night at a new, you know, different child's house."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"And so, and he has 170 something of them now."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"So it's like."
01:26:24;01:26:27;"He seems driven, like tortured by a compulsion."
01:26:27;01:26:32;"Yeah, the compulsion is I think like, loving and being loved."
01:26:32;01:26:43;"I really do think it's like, he has a good heart, but he identifies as a father to these kids, even though he could never be a father to them."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Be a father to that many kids."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Yeah."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"Well, yeah, and that, the desire to love and be loved."
01:26:48;01:26:59;"I've been thinking as we were talking, it's such an interesting time for this movie because I feel like very often I hear people talking about the fact that more people
than ever say they don't want to have kids."
01:26:59;01:27:05;"Birth rate is down. You find more people, you know, marriage is down."
01:27:05;01:27:12;"And you also have people talking about the loneliness epidemic in the Western world."
01:27:12;01:27:23;"So it's an interesting confluence of events where people have moved away from some of the dominant norms, which maybe put a lot of people into unfulfilling positions."
01:27:23;01:27:27;"Being married to somebody you don't want to be married to, having kids when you don't want to have kids."
01:27:27;01:27:40;"And yet we're in this kind of limbo now where people have to, as some of those traditional structures get loosened up, now people have to kind of figure out this world."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"And everything you're saying kind of seems related to that."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"People figuring out, yeah, how do you love and be loved?"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"How do you connect?"
01:27:48;01:27:52;"How do you have a relationship with the next generation?"
01:27:52;01:28:01;"If you're teaching math at a community college and ostensibly a single person, there's always been people who've had to figure out that they don't fit into the
traditional family world."
01:28:01;01:28:06;"But maybe we have more people than ever in America, you know, forging new paths."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Hey, amen to all those things."
01:28:08;01:28:19;"I do think that's, you know, I think we're all fundamentally, you know, I like to believe, at least myself, I get very lonely very easily."
01:28:19;01:28:31;"And, you know, I think when you make a movie, especially something like this, and it takes, you know, really several years to make and you're with these people that
generally really want to be seen in a way."
01:28:31;01:28:41;"You know, I think that's in some cases what led them to the groups in the first place, these Facebook groups where they're advertising themselves as like, I'm worthy of
replication, choose me, you know, please."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I'll do it for free even."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"It's like this really, I want to connect with you."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"Please just let me connect with you."
01:28:49;01:28:53;"And that's this longing is, it's so readily apparent."
01:28:53;01:28:59;"And so that's like the challenge, I think, of making a film about it is, it's also called Sperm World."
01:28:59;01:29:06;"So I've always, you know, I wanted the title to be something a little fun, you know, kind of like a good pop song."
01:29:06;01:29:12;"You know, it's like a song by The The or something where it's like really nice."
01:29:12;01:29:16;"You want to dance to it, but it's really sad actually when you listen to it."
01:29:16;01:29:19;"Well, you didn't wake up this morning 'cause you didn't go to bed."
01:29:19;01:29:23;"You were watching the whites of your eyes turn red."
01:29:23;01:29:28;"The calendar on your wall is ticking."
01:29:28;01:29:33;"The day's off, you've been reading some old letters."
01:29:33;01:29:37;"You smile and think how much you've changed."
01:29:37;01:29:44;"All the money in the world couldn't buy back those days."
01:29:44;01:29:51;"You pull back your pants and the sun burns into your eyes."
01:29:51;01:29:58;"You watch a plane fly across a big blue sky."
01:29:58;01:30:05;"This is the day your life will surely change."
01:30:05;01:30:11;"This is the day when things fall into place."
01:30:11;01:30:18;"Well, I gotta say, I think it's amazing that Jake's work inspired your film and that Jake was commissioned to do a painting."
01:30:18;01:30:26;"But if you had asked me to write a song called Sperm World, I think we might all be sitting at the Oscars next year."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Oh!"
01:30:28;01:30:34;"I would be wearing a tuxedo with sequined sperms on the lapel."
01:30:34;01:30:47;"And we would be looking up on that stage and seeing The Weeknd sing Sperm World, an original song for the Lance Oppenheim film written by me."
01:30:47;01:30:53;"Well, we could have gotten What's Her Face, who wrote, maybe you guys could have co-wrote it together."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Oh, Diane? Diane Warren?"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Diane Warren."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"I would love to collaborate with her."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"I missed opportunity on my part. I'm so stupid."
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Sperm World 2, we're doing this."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"I think we should give it to Becky G."
01:31:06;01:31:09;"Becky G, once again."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Give it back to them."
01:31:11;01:31:15;"Hey, well, it's not too late, man. We could always reopen the movie."
01:31:15;01:31:27;"Becky G, we could give the Time Crisis family producer credits if you're willing to front the costs."
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Produced by the New York Times and Time Crisis."
01:31:29;01:31:33;"Or maybe this has a full adaptation of The Silver Screen."
01:31:33;01:31:38;"Maybe this is a Harmony Corrine or Alexander Payne movie in three years."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"Fictionalized version."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Right, yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"You make the doc."
01:31:42;01:31:45;"I think we could still call it The Flame Inside."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Or The Fire Inside."
01:31:47;01:31:50;"Or The Fire Inside. I think we could call it The Fire Inside."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"What a great title."
01:31:52;01:31:57;"I love that. The Fire Inside from the feature film Sperm World."
01:31:57;01:32:04;"Let's go and see if we can just, every year you should try and recruit new artists with a new song."
01:32:04;01:32:07;"But just call it the same title."
01:32:07;01:32:12;"The Fire Inside, the most nominated title in Oscar history."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"This would be a sick Mike Judge movie, too."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"Oh, I love that."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Oh, yeah. Hey."
01:32:17;01:32:23;"Early on, there was a time where Alec Berg, he's such a talented guy."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"He co-created that show Barry and Silicon Valley."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"He was supposed to work on this."
01:32:29;01:32:35;"We were supposed to do this together, but it got kind of complicated with setting up the movie."
01:32:35;01:32:41;"But anyway, hey, all those people, big fans."
01:32:41;01:32:44;"And you know, look, for me, as a documentarian, I don't know."
01:32:44;01:32:46;"I don't really see myself."
01:32:46;01:32:49;"In some ways, it's like I'm trying, and you'll see it in the movie."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"It's like I'm trying to adapt."
01:32:51;01:32:57;"Everything in it is real, even though it's shot in this really heightened, kind of stylized way."
01:32:57;01:33:04;"But it's almost like I'm adapting real experiences in real life, in real time with people."
01:33:04;01:33:09;"And they're almost performing or playing themselves in the movie."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"It kind of sounds pretentious, I guess, when I say it."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"But you'll see it."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"It's sort of this feeling."
01:33:14;01:33:18;"I'm trying to inhabit this subjectivity that they feel."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"I've interviewed these people."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"That's how it works for hours on end."
01:33:22;01:33:29;"And I understand what they're feeling and their desires and the obstacles that aren't letting them express that."
01:33:29;01:33:37;"And it's sort of like, how do I use all of this s***, all of the cinematic tools that we have at our disposal"
01:33:37;01:33:44;"to basically show that, to inhabit that fantasy with them or to inhabit that subjectivity?"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"And so in that sense, it doesn't really feel like a documentary."
01:33:47;01:33:50;"It feels like you're watching a fiction film."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"That's what's so unique about your work, Lance."
01:33:52;01:34:00;"I can't really put my finger on it, because it doesn't come off as contrived or even really excessively stylized."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"It comes off as very naturalistic and real."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"Not yet, totally."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"But even just like Heaven, I know what you mean."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"That had that quality of..."
01:34:08;01:34:14;"It's like they're all kind of like a string of perfect photographs or something."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"It's very unusual."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"So hats off to you, man."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Hey, well, thank you."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Well done."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"And also, just for everybody who's been listening all this time,"
01:34:23;01:34:29;"the best place to watch Sperm World is on FX on TV or stream it on Hulu?"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Yes. Yeah."
01:34:31;01:34:37;"And if you're a Time Crisis fan and you don't live in America, apparently it's going to be on Disney+."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"Whoa."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Yeah. How's that?"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Family entertainment."
01:34:41;01:34:44;"I'm curious how long that will last."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"Some Belgian five-year-olds?"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Yeah."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Begging their parents to watch Sperm World?"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Well, I guess it's got some stuff in there."
01:34:51;01:34:55;"It's got that, you know, the stork idea, right?"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"That's what everyone tells their kids."
01:34:57;01:35:01;"I don't know if you guys tell your children, you know, about that's where babies are made."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"They're dropped from the sky from birds."
01:35:04;01:35:10;"I know. If my son ever asks, you know, where do babies come from, I say Sperm World."
01:35:10;01:35:16;"And then if he says, what is that? I say I do not care to speak on that any further."
01:35:16;01:35:21;"Maybe in about seven years when you have your own Hulu account, you'll know what I'm talking about."
01:35:21;01:35:25;"Yeah. It's instructional. That's good. I'm glad to be of service."
01:35:25;01:35:28;"Okay. Here's an unrelated question, but this is serious."
01:35:28;01:35:32;"So like, I want you to just, you're obviously a very intelligent guy."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"You went to one of America's finest schools. You met with Montaignez."
01:35:36;01:35:42;"Okay. If we tell you, you have unlimited resources and unlimited manpower."
01:35:42;01:35:46;"All you need to do is you're in charge of this project."
01:35:46;01:35:51;"So you can't go to an expert and say, oh, tell me how to do this."
01:35:51;01:35:57;"But you get everything you need. You need, you know, a hundred tons of stone."
01:35:57;01:36:02;"You got it. You need a thousand men. You got it."
01:36:02;01:36:05;"All you need to do. And you have all the time you want."
01:36:05;01:36:09;"All you need to do is build the Brooklyn Bridge."
01:36:09;01:36:13;"How are you doing it? Which, by the way, they built in 1870."
01:36:13;01:36:16;"So think about how much we have today that they didn't have back then."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"How do you start? Wow. Well, you know, it's a great question."
01:36:19;01:36:24;"I actually did. Have you ever seen the Ken Burns documentary, the Brooklyn Bridge?"
01:36:24;01:36:27;"Oh my God. Sorry, I'm bringing this up."
01:36:27;01:36:31;"Wait, does that exist? I'm aware of this film. I didn't know that."
01:36:31;01:36:35;"I apologize. I think you're about to wear."
01:36:35;01:36:38;"It's a mother****** banker. You picked the right guy."
01:36:38;01:36:43;"Your expertise in documentaries might actually save you in this contrived scenario."
01:36:43;01:36:48;"OK, go on. OK, well, you know, every night I go to bed and my girlfriend,"
01:36:48;01:36:54;"she puts on one of the Ken Burns movie or she puts on like a, you know, old."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"Well, yeah, it's usually like it's like the Dust Bowl, you know,"
01:36:57;01:37:00;"but one of them I was riveted by, which is the Brooklyn Bridge."
01:37:00;01:37:05;"And this guy, John Roebling or Washington Roebling."
01:37:05;01:37:09;"So it's like the street in Brooklyn. Roebling. Yes. It is a father son duo."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"There was a guy, the father was an architect. I'm not answering your question,"
01:37:12;01:37:18;"but there's a two guy. I like this architect genius who designed it."
01:37:18;01:37:22;"And then he died. And his son basically, who was like, I think in his early 30s,"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"given the blueprint and was just like, you know, it's basically what you're telling me."
01:37:26;01:37:30;"Build it, you know, figure it out. And so this and he did it."
01:37:30;01:37:34;"He did a great job. And I guess what they ended up doing was they they created"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"these things called casings, these like wooden. Right. I knew it."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"I knew the case sounds. Yes. Yeah. Case on."
01:37:40;01:37:43;"You say a case on case. That's how I heard it pronounced. Yeah."
01:37:43;01:37:47;"Maybe a case. And they put that down in the water. Right."
01:37:47;01:37:50;"And then these guys, I guess I wouldn't know how to. OK, OK. Well, hold on."
01:37:50;01:37:53;"Don't just don't don't just bulldoze through that."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"How do they put it down in the water? 1870."
01:37:56;01:38:04;"How do you how do you get that going? I honestly, I send a guy down to the bottom of the East River."
01:38:04;01:38:09;"You build it, you build it on land and then you drop it in, I guess somehow."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"And then you pump it so heavy that it goes all the way to the bottom."
01:38:12;01:38:17;"But, you know, every person who went down there, including John Washington Roebling,"
01:38:17;01:38:22;"the father, the son of Washington Roebling, who John Roebling, I think, is his name,"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"who built the whole thing, he got the bends. That's what all those guys got."
01:38:25;01:38:32;"And he basically got so f***** up by the by his work down there that he was he was hospitalized."
01:38:32;01:38:37;"And then he was immobile for the rest of his life. And he lived basically with every day."
01:38:37;01:38:43;"He'd look outside his window because he lived really, really close to the bridge and he'd watch them build it."
01:38:43;01:38:47;"And his wife was the one who would basically he had binoculars."
01:38:47;01:38:52;"He'd look and his wife would be the one by the end to really actually build the whole thing,"
01:38:52;01:38:56;"because she was going between him and the people and the builders."
01:38:56;01:39:02;"And so I guess if I was to answer your question, like if I had everything, what would I what would I need?"
01:39:02;01:39:05;"And I think it would start with the caisson or caisson."
01:39:05;01:39:09;"I think it'd be a good partner, a life partner. Love. I think I'd need love."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"That's what I'd need. That's my answer."
01:39:11;01:39:12;"Great answer, Lance."
01:39:12;01:39:20;"One shot is never enough. I just wait for us to go in circles."
01:39:20;01:39:24;"A lifetime of giving up for you."
01:39:24;01:39:28;"One star of giving consists of loving."
01:39:28;01:39:32;"I'm fussy but tell me I'm his friend."
01:39:32;01:39:36;"Actually no thanks, I'm OK."
01:39:36;01:39:40;"And I'm even sad we lost my way."
01:39:41;01:39:46;"I want new friends but they're all on me."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"Making plans while I'm shaving."
01:39:50;01:39:54;"Thought it was it but maybe it's me."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"I want new friends but they're all on me."
01:39:58;01:40:04;"And the 80s song, yeah how'd it go?"
01:40:06;01:40:12;"When they said this was the beginning of the best years ever."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"False. Break."
01:40:14;01:40:19;"Now that I know that you're a low-key expert on the Brooklyn Bridge due to your background in documentaries,"
01:40:19;01:40:30;"do you think if we gave you 10 years and you and your girlfriend with unlimited manpower and supplies could build the Brooklyn Bridge,"
01:40:30;01:40:33;"do you remember enough from the documentary that you think you could get it going?"
01:40:33;01:40:38;"No, but I think it wouldn't be for lack of trying."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"I think they had some of those pieces."
01:40:40;01:40:44;"I mean the irony, look, is that I don't even think,"
01:40:44;01:40:50;"that's the thing that's just so crazy about the Brooklyn Bridge is that I think if they were to build that or try to build it right now,"
01:40:50;01:40:54;"it would take them like five times the amount of time it took those guys."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"And it took them I think..."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"13 years."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"Unbelievable."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"In China they do that sh*t overnight."
01:41:00;01:41:08;"If you want to watch some interesting YouTube videos, this is another thing my girlfriend got me hooked on."
01:41:08;01:41:17;"There's all these strange kind of pro-machine YouTube videos that seems like maybe they were made by humans, the videos."
01:41:17;01:41:23;"But there's a voiceover and they're talking about, you know, there's no humans in this factory, it's just machines."
01:41:23;01:41:32;"And it's like a cool, like, you know, energetic music and it shows the power of the machine as it builds this like massive, you know, ocean liner."
01:41:32;01:41:37;"So I guess maybe that's the answer is just like no humans, you know."
01:41:37;01:41:41;"I always thought another movie, you ever see American Factory?"
01:41:41;01:41:44;"I always thought the ending of that was so awesome."
01:41:44;01:41:48;"Pretty depressing ending."
01:41:48;01:41:52;"But they were like, yeah, all these workers, they're all whining all the time."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"We're just going to replace them."
01:41:54;01:41:57;"And that's what happens."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Who knows?"
01:41:58;01:42:03;"We need like a WPA type thing that what I'd love to see."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"There's so many people out of work these days."
01:42:05;01:42:12;"And beyond that, as maybe you touch on in your work, people just looking for love and meaning."
01:42:12;01:42:25;"I think we need a new WPA where all over America, in all 50 states, we just get aimless young people building the Brooklyn Bridge."
01:42:25;01:42:31;"I want to see a Brooklyn Bridge in the across every body of water we can think of."
01:42:31;01:42:40;"I think we could get millions of young Americans building the Brooklyn Bridge from Alaska to Wisconsin to Florida."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"I think there's something to it."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"And I think the challenge of saying, well, those guys did it in 1870 and 13 years."
01:42:46;01:42:47;"Can you beat it?"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"Can you do it in nine years?"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"I just think it could motivate an entire generation."
01:42:52;01:42:55;"But what do people don't know what they're here for?"
01:42:55;01:42:59;"And a lot of people probably were put on this earth to build the Brooklyn Bridge, but they already built it."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"Yeah."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"You know what I mean?"
01:43:01;01:43:09;"Well, that's why probably in a place where like, you know, yeah, China or something, it's like the people that are there."
01:43:09;01:43:16;"And they're so galvanized to work on these public, maybe not public, private projects, too."
01:43:16;01:43:19;"I think that question of like, you know, what am I here for?"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"What's what's going on?"
01:43:21;01:43:24;"You know, it seems like those guys in those videos I watch, they're not questioning that at all."
01:43:24;01:43:27;"It seems like they know exactly what you're saying."
01:43:27;01:43:30;"Just go for it."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"I don't know."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"You know, I don't know how you guys feel when you when you finish."
01:43:33;01:43:43;"You know, I've asked Jake this when he finishes a painting or, you know, Nick, when you're finishing your show or as we finish an album, you finish an episode of this
podcast."
01:43:43;01:43:49;"It's like there's a profound sense of just nothing that I feel."
01:43:49;01:43:55;"You know, it's like I love this film I made so much and I it's it's but it was so stressful to make."
01:43:55;01:44:00;"And now that it's done, I don't feel any sense of pleasure."
01:44:00;01:44:08;"I just feel just kind of nothing and sad, really, because I love the people in the movie and I loved making it."
01:44:08;01:44:11;"But I probably should have enjoyed it more while I did it."
01:44:11;01:44:16;"Right. I guess in your line of work, you got to say goodbye to your co-workers."
01:44:16;01:44:22;"You're not going to be meeting them for a game of tennis or a coffee at Starbucks."
01:44:22;01:44:25;"Well, it depends. I work with the same people."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"I mean, I have another project that's going to."
01:44:27;01:44:31;"Hey, I hope you guys watch it. It's called Ren Fair and it comes out on HBO later."
01:44:31;01:44:34;"I've been hearing about this from Eli Bush."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"Yeah, you're doing it."
01:44:35;01:44:38;"Who is the first Vampire Weekend fan?"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"Wow. Really?"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"Literally, he was the first Vampire Weekend fan."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"Wow. Wow. That's cool. Yeah, he's great."
01:44:44;01:44:52;"He's been saying it's amazing. And so this is another forthcoming TV show that's about a Renaissance fair in Texas."
01:44:52;01:44:56;"Yes. Yes. It's like a succession story that takes place there."
01:44:56;01:45:00;"So, you know, a lot of the people that I worked with on Sperm World also worked on that one."
01:45:00;01:45:08;"And I just try to keep this in. Most of them are like my friends from college and, you know, friends from other places, too."
01:45:08;01:45:12;"So it's nice. It's like a it's kind of like a band of collaborators."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"And we've been making films together for a while now."
01:45:14;01:45:20;"Oh, really? Yeah. It's like it's the people like you're saying, though, it's the people that are in the movie that, you know, you get so close."
01:45:20;01:45:30;"I feel like when someone opens up to you and, you know, they're vulnerable with you and you're vulnerable with them, it's like impossible to not, you know, you kind of
you do fall in love with them in a way."
01:45:30;01:45:37;"And so how do you keep that alive when you're not forced to be with each other because you're making something together?"
01:45:37;01:45:42;"That's the hey, the billion dollar question. Right."
01:45:42;01:45:54;"I can see that. I think I say to you when you're talking about feeling empty and nothing after you completed this major project was trying to keep in mind, it's the
journey, not the destination."
01:45:54;01:46:07;"It's the work. It's the process. You know, Ezra, like now that your new record's done, it's like, are you you know, it's was it the making of it that was rewarding or is it
like kicking back and being like, oh, I made a great record."
01:46:07;01:46:15;"I feel so proud of myself. It's like it's both. I mean, as it's been reported in the press recently, my passion in life is chilling."
01:46:15;01:46:23;"And and I really I really mean that I love kicking back. And I've I've only gotten better at it as I've gotten older."
01:46:23;01:46:34;"You're very good at chilling. I used to get more antsy. Oh, what am I doing? Am I not keeping up with the other people? Am I not, you know, fulfilling my potential or
whatever?"
01:46:34;01:46:42;"Now I've gotten better and better at it. So when I'm done with the project, I feel a sense of relief and the people I work with, I see all the time."
01:46:42;01:46:47;"So there's also I don't I don't have to I understand what you're talking about, Lance. And that seems like real."
01:46:47;01:46:54;"Like I finished an album. I'll probably like CRL, CT Bay, all these people. I'll see them like next week."
01:46:54;01:47:00;"You know, it's not some big dramatic thing. And then we got the tour after the album. Then after that, we'll go back."
01:47:00;01:47:08;"So if anything, I enjoy the free time when the big project's done just to relax a little bit and hang with the family."
01:47:08;01:47:14;"So I don't I don't really feel empty. And I know this is corny and this would be a longer conversation."
01:47:14;01:47:20;"But also, as I've gotten older, I know me and Nick have talked about this, but and I think me and you, Jake."
01:47:20;01:47:29;"But, you know, I also really believe that the truest form of art is just living well, you know, vibing, whatever that means."
01:47:29;01:47:39;"You know, following your path. And like, I do think eventually there's a way where anybody who's an artist and you guys are obviously artists,"
01:47:39;01:47:55;"anybody who is an artistic guy, you know, eventually you'll figure out how you just apply that to just the day to day and not in a way where where you have to put it on film or
on canvas or on wax or whatever your medium is."
01:47:55;01:48:01;"That's definitely something I've noticed more and more. I'm like, I know a lot of great artists. I've been lucky to know great artists in my life."
01:48:01;01:48:07;"And I increasingly look at some of the people I've known in life who never really became professional artists, but just like know how to live."
01:48:07;01:48:13;"And I consider them great artists as well. You know, like it's all heading to the same place."
01:48:13;01:48:22;"You can organize the images you see in a documentary or an album or a painting. And that's great. And we have to do it because we love it."
01:48:22;01:48:29;"But also there's people who just organize life in their mind too. You know what I mean? And they're artists too."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"Yeah."
01:48:30;01:48:39;"And even though their job is not artists, I could probably articulate this better, but it's a feeling I get sometimes. You guys know what I mean?"
01:48:39;01:48:48;"Yeah. There's a beauty to seeing people. There's plenty of people that I'm sure you know that aren't professionally making stuff or maybe they don't even have a job."
01:48:48;01:48:54;"Right. But they're living interestingly. And yeah, like we were saying, they're living well."
01:48:54;01:49:05;"On the one hand, the negative slant on somebody who just knows how to live would be like, well, you know, it's too bad they never figured out how to turn their worldview
into a piece of art that they could share with other people."
01:49:05;01:49:11;"That's the negative slant. The positive slant is, oh, they just cut out the middleman. They don't need the medium."
01:49:11;01:49:19;"And at this phase of my life, I still need the medium. I still need albums as something to work for and to organize my thoughts and stuff."
01:49:19;01:49:27;"And I know it sounds corny, but I hope there's a time in my life where I'm just like, this is the album. You know?"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Yeah."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Well, great to have you on, Lance."
01:49:31;01:49:36;"Yeah. Thank you, guys. It's been a great, you know, I'm a big fan of each of you."
01:49:36;01:49:49;"Likewise. We're all admirers of your work and I encourage everybody to check out, well, if you haven't seen Some Kind of Heaven, check that out and Sperm World and soon,
pretty soon Ren Faire."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"Yeah."
01:49:50;01:49:58;"Yeah. And Over the Summer. And yeah, thank you for everything. And Jake, you know, thank you for doing what you do."
01:49:58;01:50:05;"I honestly think the movie probably, I've said this to you before, but I really don't think it would be looking the same way if your paintings didn't exist."
01:50:05;01:50:16;"It's, you know, I had that in my folder, my Dropbox folder. I'd bring it up to my cinematographer, David Bowen, and say, come on, why can't it look like this? Why can't it
look like this?"
01:50:16;01:50:24;"He said, it's a painting. That's why it can't look like this. It's a painting. You know, we're a documentary film crew. But, you know, we tried."
01:50:24;01:50:28;"There's some images that I think we got a little..."
01:50:28;01:50:38;"I think you guys crushed it. I know what it's like to be out there photographing and having things not lining up the way you want them to line up. It's so frustrating."
01:50:38;01:50:45;"So I understand. I completely was in love with your work. So thank you, man."
01:50:45;01:50:54;"Thank you. All right, guys. Well, hey, take care and good luck with the cracking the mystery of Richards. I'm sure you'll find the answers somewhere."
01:50:54;01:51:01;"We'll be reaching out to your agents shortly to lock you up for the next 10 years on this project. Don't worry about it. All right. Thanks so much, Lance."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Okay. See you guys."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"See you, Lance. Bye."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Bye."
01:51:05;01:51:11;"Can't reach the moon now. Can't turn the tide."
01:51:11;01:51:18;"The world looked different when God was on your side."
01:51:18;01:51:25;"Who bears the future? Do they care why?"
01:51:25;01:51:30;"I know you're tired of trying to listen clearly."
01:51:30;01:51:39;"You don't have to try. Capcom, the year that you were born."
01:51:39;01:51:45;"Finished first and the next one was yours."
01:51:45;01:51:52;"Too old, too young to live alone."
01:51:52;01:51:59;"Sifting through centuries for moments of your own."
01:51:59;01:52:03;"I really think in time crisis films, we should get this off the ground."
01:52:03;01:52:11;"I know we've we've joked many times over the years about some of our more outrageous ideas for features."
01:52:11;01:52:17;"But I think the TC Dock Company. I think we could we could make some noise."
01:52:17;01:52:25;"Okay. You know what? All right. This week we had new music from Vampire Weekend."
01:52:25;01:52:32;"We had great conversation with Lance Oppenheim about Sperm World."
01:52:32;01:52:37;"We're not going to do the top five this week, but there's an email we've had kicking around for a long time."
01:52:37;01:52:44;"And we get so many great emails from people. But, you know, we're not a we're not a mailbag based show."
01:52:44;01:52:48;"We just aren't. We try to just find these topics."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"Let them reveal themselves to us as we speak to each other."
01:52:51;01:52:55;"Once in a blue moon, we'll hit the mailbag. It's just not always the right time."
01:52:55;01:53:01;"But we got a great email. When is this from? Oh, my. This is already going back to November 2023."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"So we I remember we're talking about the Jay Giles band on the program."
01:53:04;01:53:10;"This is a real nice email from a guy named John. I know you fellas are probably past your Jay Giles talk."
01:53:10;01:53:14;"Well, we were. But we're ready to get back in. We're back."
01:53:14;01:53:18;"But Ezra should check out Give It To Me, the live or studio recording."
01:53:18;01:53:23;"It's a weird ska song that transitions into a funky East Coast rock jam."
01:53:23;01:53:28;"I think Ezra would be into it. Right. We talked a lot about Jay Giles having that East Coast sound."
01:53:28;01:53:33;"Love the show, John. And I love this. He's a Northeast New Jersey TC head."
01:53:33;01:53:39;"That's my neck of the woods. Shout out to Bouncing Souls, St. Barnabas Hospital, McDonald's,"
01:53:39;01:53:44;"and a Circa 2005 production of Urinetown that starred Emma Koenig, my sister, and my brother, Tom."
01:53:44;01:53:50;"All right. So I'm actually very connected to this guy. Our siblings acted together in a play in New Jersey."
01:53:50;01:53:57;"And he even he knows the best punk bands out of Jersey and that St. Barnabas Hospital, McDonald's."
01:53:57;01:54:03;"Let's check it out. Give It To Me by Jay Giles Band. I think maybe I checked this out when we got this email."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"I can't remember."
01:54:04;01:54:25;"This sounds so East Coast to me. I can't explain it. I know this is not recorded."
01:54:25;01:54:39;"Yeah, I remember this song. This is a great song. Yeah, this is totally that like first two seasons of SNL energy."
01:54:39;01:54:50;"Like before there was like real punk or anything."
01:54:50;01:54:55;"This is great. It's a little bit early Bruce Springsteen. Yeah, I was thinking that."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"A little Elvis Costello in there. Yeah, a little Elvis Costello."
01:54:58;01:55:05;"You could even say that this is a little bit Trad Wave. Like slightly still East Coast reggae."
01:55:05;01:55:10;"Whenever I get this transition, I bet it gets Trad Wave. Yeah, I want to see where it goes."
01:55:10;01:55:36;"I mean, this sounds real Elvis Costello. Is this his normal inflection?"
01:55:36;01:55:43;"So first of all, this is from 1973. Whoa. So Elvis was taking a page out of Jay Giles book."
01:55:43;01:55:53;"Yeah. It reminds me of Stir It Up. Yeah. But Stir It Up. It's Bob Marley meets that East Coast energy."
01:55:53;01:55:58;"Yeah, it's like Bob Marley meets Asbury Park era Bruce."
01:55:58;01:56:07;"Yeah. And Bruce's first two albums came out in '73. So this really is that. I feel like Stir It Up is '73."
01:56:07;01:56:25;"Oh, could be. Bob Marley song. Here we go."
01:56:25;01:56:40;"Went somewhere totally different. Pretty squeeze. Very. This organ."
01:56:40;01:56:49;"I wonder if the guys in Squeeze knew this 1973 Jay Giles song. Definitely."
01:56:49;01:56:56;"I love this song. Thank you, John."
01:56:56;01:57:11;"Whoa. What? This song doesn't quit."
01:57:11;01:57:17;"I guess this is produced by Bill Sismick. Oh, yeah. He's like a. He did the Eagles."
01:57:17;01:57:31;"Oh, damn. He did On the Border in Hotel California later in the 70s."
01:57:31;01:57:36;"Don Henley and Glenn Fyver were like, Bill, we like what you're doing with the Jay Giles, but come out here."
01:57:36;01:57:40;"Let's strip a little bit of that East Coast energy out of that. We're a West Coast band, man."
01:57:40;01:57:45;"And let's give it some of that breezy kind of dry desert air."
01:57:45;01:57:53;"I love the idea that the Eagles are basically run by a guy from Michigan, a guy from Texas, right down the middle of America."
01:57:53;01:57:58;"They could have gone east. They could have gone west. They made their choice. Go west, young man."
01:57:58;01:58:01;"If they'd gone east, they could have given the Jay Giles band run for their money."
01:58:01;01:58:13;"Yeah. Can you mention East Coast Eagles? It just doesn't work. It doesn't work."
01:58:13;01:58:20;"Welcome to the Hotel Pennsylvania. Yeah, they meet in Grants Village or something or they meet downtown."
01:58:20;01:58:25;"They meet at Max's Kansas City or something. It's it's just doesn't it's it doesn't work."
01:58:25;01:58:32;"They're like they're seeing the New York Dolls play. What is this garbage?"
01:58:32;01:58:42;"Well, they probably would have invented Trad Wave or dude like Don Henley hanging out like at the factory."
01:58:42;01:58:49;"Andy Warhol's just like Andy Warhol produces the first Eagles album."
01:58:49;01:59:03;"Clem Fry rolled into the factory. The Eagles featuring Nico."
01:59:03;01:59:07;"This is a long song. God, that is the talk about rock and roll fantasy, man."
01:59:07;01:59:17;"The Eagles featuring Nico. Squeeze covered Looking for Love, which was a Jay Giles band hit."
01:59:17;01:59:26;"OK, so squeeze is our Jay Giles fans. All right."
01:59:26;01:59:30;"They're pushing their luck with this. This is the album version. There is a single edit."
01:59:30;01:59:45;"That's only three minutes. All right. Come on. Are you going to are you going to are you going to drop back into that East Coast reggae sound?"
01:59:45;01:59:56;"One, two, three, four. Give it to me. Come on, guys. All right."
01:59:56;02:00:05;"This is pretty weak. This part. Although remember that they're East Coast."
02:00:05;02:00:14;"So this is this is kind of before ESG. This is that kind of minimalist proto hip hop kind of New York funk."
02:00:14;02:00:18;"And they're just going to fade out. That's crazy."
02:00:18;02:00:24;"That's a wild choice. That's insane. All right. Thank you to the Jay Giles band."
02:00:24;02:00:28;"Thank you to Lance Oppenheim. We'll see you guys soon."
02:00:28;02:00:36;"And don't forget this Friday. Only God was above us. New Vampire Weekend album."
