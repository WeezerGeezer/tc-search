00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, Season 2, Episode 2. This week we'll be mourning the loss of musical legend Prince,"
00:08;00:13;"calling a bunch of our friends to talk about it. We'll also be talking about Flame Wars,"
00:13;00:20;"and I'll be revisiting the battleground with music journalist Zachary Lopez. Plus,"
00:20;00:25;"Jake and I will be talking about the New York closed primary, and of course,"
00:25;00:34;"we'll be counting down the top 5 hits of 1968 and 2016. This is Time Crisis, with Angela Kane."
00:34;00:51;"In"
00:51;00:57;"8"
00:57;01:09;"And so I tell to the world, one of us had to go, now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:20;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying, leave her lonely there."
01:20;01:32;"Staring at the ceiling, wishing she was somewhere else in space."
01:32;01:38;"One of us is lonely, one of us is lonely."
01:38;01:43;"We're back. I'm here in Los Angeles with my man Jake Longstreth. What's up Jake?"
01:43;01:44;"Hey, how are you?"
01:44;01:48;"I'm okay. 2016 man, crazy year."
01:48;01:51;"Yeah, a lot of heavyweights dropping."
01:51;01:54;"I know, notably this week, Prince."
01:54;01:55;"Yeah."
01:55;01:57;"But one of many, it started off the year with Bowie."
01:57;02:00;"It was like Bowie and Alan Rickman were back to back."
02:00;02:07;"You and I were talking a little bit before about Bowie, Alan Rickman, and Glenn Frey all died in like a week."
02:07;02:08;"Right."
02:08;02:10;"We were wondering, do you think they'd all met each other?"
02:10;02:15;"And my theory was that Bowie and Rickman had met."
02:15;02:16;"Yeah."
02:16;02:21;"And Bowie and Frey had met, but that Rickman and Frey had not met."
02:21;02:25;"I know, because like David Bowie and the Eagles, they were the exact same time of being huge."
02:25;02:26;"Yeah."
02:26;02:27;"But alternate universe."
02:27;02:37;"Yeah. But you have to just think, I mean like, either like some Grammy award thing, or like, you know, the Eagles are playing a big show, Bowie's in town, one of Bowie's
like managers is like,"
02:37;02:38;"You want to come see the Eagles?"
02:38;02:40;"And he's like, fine."
02:40;02:41;"I feel like Bowie-"
02:41;02:42;"Come backstage, say hi."
02:42;02:44;"Hello gentlemen."
02:44;02:50;"Frey and Henley just like, Bowie, you're out there man."
02:50;02:54;"You're a real freak, but we respect what you do, buddy."
02:54;02:56;"Randy Miser's just like, who is this?"
02:56;02:59;"Oh man."
02:59;03:05;"I think that Bowie probably would not have been a fan of like Take It Easy and that stuff."
03:05;03:08;"But I feel like Hotel California probably would have piqued his interest. The song."
03:08;03:10;"Just the lyrics and the sort of metaphor."
03:10;03:12;"I just think like, you know, that's their coolest song."
03:12;03:13;"Is it?"
03:13;03:14;"I think so."
03:14;03:15;"I don't think so."
03:15;03:20;"Anyway, I mean, that was earlier in this year. Obviously Prince is a huge bummer. Fife Dog, not that long ago."
03:20;03:23;"Who's Fife Dog? Oh, from Wu-Tang?"
03:23;03:25;"Oh man. Oh, Jake."
03:25;03:26;"Wait, what?"
03:26;03:31;"All right, remember, to everybody before you get angry, Jake is our resident rock guy. He's from Tribe Called Quest."
03:31;03:34;"I missed the boat on like 90s East Coast rap."
03:34;03:35;"All right."
03:35;03:36;"Just missed the boat."
03:36;03:40;"You're busy doing other things. That's fine. You know my grandfather died this year too?"
03:40;03:41;"I did not know that."
03:41;03:43;"He died like a month ago."
03:43;03:44;"Really?"
03:44;03:45;"He was 97 though."
03:45;03:46;"Oh, okay."
03:46;03:55;"I mean, Prince, 57. Jeez, that's brutal. But yeah, my grandfather being 97, it was like, of course I was really sad when I found out."
03:55;04:01;"But you know, I think when people die at that age, it's obviously not a tragedy. It's more like a definitive like end of an era."
04:01;04:11;"Right. I mean, did it come as a relief or was it just like, oh, and like, was he struggling or was it a thing like, oh, he's just a chipper old man doing well and then he just
died real suddenly?"
04:11;04:17;"Compared to other grandparents I had who were like really out there towards the end, his life was just, it was interesting."
04:17;04:28;"It was like a little strange to me, but he lived in the Bronx on, I think like the 18th floor of like this huge brick tower in this area called Co-op City, which is kind of
like subsidized low-income housing."
04:28;04:36;"He was always like very pleasant, very happy, but we go see him and it's like, there's something weird to me about him just being like on the 18th floor of this like little
apartment."
04:36;04:37;"How long was he in that apartment for?"
04:37;04:41;"That's an interesting thing. He and my grandmother moved in when Co-op City was first built in the 70s."
04:41;04:42;"Wow."
04:42;04:47;"So they were the only people who ever lived there. Anyway, brutal year. So many people dying."
04:47;04:49;"One of my favorites, Merle Haggard."
04:49;04:50;"Oh yeah, country legend."
04:50;04:54;"I saw him play two years ago at the Canyon Club in Agora Hills."
04:54;04:55;"Oh really?"
04:55;04:57;"Yeah, it's great. It's a small little club."
04:57;04:58;"Oh yeah, I've heard about that place."
04:58;04:59;"It's cool."
04:59;05:02;"That's cool you got to see him in the last couple years of his life."
05:02;05:18;"Yeah, he had like a full nine-piece band and they went out on stage first and sort of just like warmed it up with the instrumental medley of some of his hits, and then kind
of like vamped into this like, kind of just like, doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot and then Merle seven minutes into the set kind of just saunters out."
05:18;05:19;"Yeah."
05:19;05:24;"And like real slow wave and he's just like, ""Howdy."" And just starts singing. It was awesome."
05:24;05:28;"AJ, what's a good Merle Haggard song that we should play the Time Crisis audience?"
05:28;05:31;"Maybe Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today."
05:31;05:33;"Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today."
05:33;05:34;"Yeah, wordy."
05:34;05:37;"Here's Merle Haggard with Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today."
05:47;05:57;"For years I've been busting my rear to make a living, but it ain't made."
05:57;06:06;"For years I've been trying to pay off my bills, but they ain't paid."
06:06;06:16;"Oh, every dime I make, every soul I know, the higher up I reach, the farther down I go."
06:16;06:22;"This old broken back of mine is all I've got to show."
06:22;06:36;"And anyway, a working man can't get nowhere today. Lord, a working man can't get nowhere today."
06:36;06:48;"A working man ain't got no time to play. Today I'll work my fanny off and leave it in play."
06:48;06:53;"A working man can't get nowhere today."
07:09;07:16;"I pay my income tax, and the government gives back what I got coming on."
07:16;07:20;"Lord, but it ain't much."
07:20;07:28;"I pay my child support, 'cause I'm a law-abiding sort and an easy touch."
07:28;07:33;"And I starve myself to death trying to keep my family fed."
07:33;07:44;"I keep my budget tight, trying to get myself ahead, but I'll still be deep in debt the day that I fall dead."
07:44;07:53;"That's why I say, Lord, a working man can't get nowhere today."
07:53;08:04;"A working man can't get nowhere today. A working man ain't got no time to play."
08:04;08:11;"Tonight I'll work my fanny off and leave it in play."
08:11;08:16;"A working man can't get nowhere today."
08:21;08:24;"Beats, womp, womp."
08:36;08:42;"It's getting late, have you seen my mates? Why tell me when the boys get here?"
08:42;08:48;"It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock, wanna get a belly full of beer."
08:48;08:54;"My old man's a drunk, I found a barrel full of monkeys and my old lady, she don't care."
08:54;09:04;"My sister looks cute in her braces and boots, a handful of grease in her hair."
09:04;09:10;"Oh, don't give a snot in your observation, we're hiding where the ducks are playing."
09:10;09:17;"Oh, Saturday night's all right for fighting, get a little action in."
09:17;09:23;"Get a man a sword and a big old train, gonna set the stands alight."
09:23;09:31;"Saturday night's the night I like, Saturday night's all right, all right, all right."
09:42;09:48;"Well, the black widow talking here tonight, I'm looking for a girl that'll see me right."
09:48;09:55;"I could use a little muscle to get what I need, I could sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's the man!"""
09:55;10:01;"I call all of the sounds that I really like, all the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike."
10:01;10:08;"I'm a juvenile prodigal for working class, who spends rent and clothes in the bottom of a glass."
10:08;10:17;"Oh, don't give a snot in your observation, we're hiding where the ducks are playing."
10:17;10:23;"Saturday night's all right for fighting, get a little action in."
10:23;10:29;"Get a man a sword and a big old train, gonna set the stands alight."
10:29;10:37;"Saturday night's the night I like, Saturday night's all right, all right, all right."
11:06;11:16;"Oh, don't give a snot in your observation, we're hiding where the ducks are playing."
11:16;11:22;"Saturday night's all right for fighting, get a little action in."
11:22;11:28;"Get a man a sword and a big old train, gonna set the stands alight."
11:28;11:36;"Saturday night's the night I like, Saturday night's all right, all right, all right."
11:54;12:05;"Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, not for right."

12:54;12:58;"Filling in for our regular host, Fareed Zachariah."
12:58;13:00;"Beats, beats, beats, beats, beats."
13:00;13:01;"♪"
13:01;13:02;"One."
13:02;13:04;"Let's pivot and talk about the living."
13:04;13:05;"We gotta pay tribute to Prince later."
13:05;13:06;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
13:06;13:08;"Of course, one of the most influential"
13:08;13:09;"musicians of all time."
13:09;13:10;"57, way too young."
13:10;13:11;"That'll be later in the show."
13:11;13:12;"We'll pay tribute to him."
13:12;13:15;"But you and I were in New York together."
13:15;13:16;"Yeah, a week ago."
13:16;13:19;"We were there for the big Bernie rally"
13:19;13:20;"in Washington Square Park."
13:20;13:23;"And this is one of many Bernie rallies that happened."
13:23;13:28;"Of course, these rallies were not enough"
13:28;13:29;"to win him the primary."
13:29;13:31;"Beaten soundly."
13:31;13:32;"Bernie got whooped."
13:32;13:34;"Yeah, 18 points, 16 points."
13:34;13:36;"Yeah, it was serious."
13:36;13:39;"The thing about it, and I was getting kind of vocal"
13:39;13:43;"on social media about it, is that I knew that New York"
13:43;13:48;"had a very early deadline to become a Democrat."
13:48;13:49;"Right."
13:49;13:50;"And I'm not talking about Republicans becoming Democrats."
13:50;13:51;"Maybe that's a different thing."
13:51;13:53;"Literally unaffiliated voters,"
13:53;13:55;"independents becoming Democrats was October 9th."
13:55;13:57;"Were you registered as a Democrat?"
13:57;13:58;"No, I was registered as an independent."
13:58;14:00;"Okay."
14:00;14:01;"So at first I was kind of like, well, you know,"
14:01;14:04;"a lot of people I know missed the registration date."
14:04;14:05;"No big deal."
14:05;14:06;"But then the more I was thinking about it,"
14:06;14:09;"I was like, why does New York have the earliest"
14:09;14:10;"in the country?"
14:10;14:14;"Like New Jersey, which also has a closed primary,"
14:14;14:16;"you could register as a Democrat maybe two months before."
14:16;14:18;"New York, six months."
14:18;14:19;"I think California's just a few weeks."
14:19;14:21;"Yeah, so other states it's very different."
14:21;14:23;"And I'm not talking about caucuses versus primaries."
14:23;14:24;"I'm literally talking about other states"
14:24;14:25;"with closed primaries,"
14:25;14:27;"the same type of voting mechanism."
14:27;14:29;"And then the thing that really bothered me about it"
14:29;14:31;"was when I was like looking back at the dates"
14:31;14:33;"and I was like, when was the first debate?"
14:33;14:36;"And the first debate was October 14th."
14:36;14:40;"And like, if we're just going to have this facade of like,"
14:40;14:45;"you know, the parties presenting the candidates"
14:45;14:49;"to the people showing America who the Democrats have this"
14:49;14:50;"year, who the Republicans have this year,"
14:50;14:53;"if we're going to at least pretend that in some way,"
14:53;14:56;"you can't have the deadline before the first debate."
14:56;14:58;"Yeah."
14:58;14:59;"And people say, well, shouldn't, you know,"
14:59;15:01;"if you're a Democrat by before the first debate?"
15:01;15:03;"No, you should be able to watch and see."
15:03;15:05;"So that was the thing that really bothered me about it."
15:05;15:06;"So I was getting on some social media."
15:06;15:08;"I mean, in this case, it's very extreme."
15:08;15:12;"Usually there's not a kind of outsider"
15:12;15:15;"that decides to join the party to run for president"
15:15;15:19;"and is like legitimately a different type of candidate"
15:19;15:20;"than the other candidates."
15:20;15:23;"Usually it's like four milquetoast Democrats"
15:23;15:24;"all running against each other."
15:24;15:25;"But even--"
15:25;15:27;"And sort of like the rules are set in place."
15:27;15:28;"Right, so less people care."
15:28;15:30;"But even in a year like that, I believe"
15:30;15:32;"that an informed citizen should get to maybe watch"
15:32;15:35;"a couple debates, wait until these candidates are more"
15:35;15:36;"well-known in the news."
15:36;15:39;"Because obviously, when you have the registration"
15:39;15:42;"before the debates, you're heavily"
15:42;15:44;"favoring the better-known candidates."
15:44;15:45;"Yeah."
15:45;15:46;"But let's at least get a few months for maybe things"
15:46;15:48;"to even out if some interesting person"
15:48;15:49;"is coming from out of nowhere."
15:49;15:51;"I mean, it is deliberately designed that way,"
15:51;15:52;"you realize, obviously."
15:52;15:54;"Because they don't want some populist candidate that's"
15:54;15:57;"way out there and is going to garner"
15:57;15:59;"a lot of enthusiasm within the party"
16:00;16:02;"because they're presenting an extreme version"
16:02;16:04;"of those parties' values, but then present"
16:04;16:07;"an unelectable option in the general election,"
16:07;16:10;"like the way Trump is doing in the right for the Republicans."
16:10;16:11;"Because I agree with you."
16:11;16:12;"I think that the system is partially"
16:12;16:19;"designed to favor establishment, well-known candidates."
16:19;16:21;"The six months is totally extreme."
16:21;16:22;"It's totally extreme."
16:22;16:26;"Did it cause Bernie to lose?"
16:26;16:27;"Man, I don't know."
16:27;16:28;"I doubt it."
16:28;16:29;"Yeah."
16:29;16:30;"I mean, it's a 16-point--"
16:30;16:32;"I mean, it's Hillary's adopted home state."
16:32;16:33;"There were millions of people who"
16:33;16:35;"could not make an informed decision about joining"
16:35;16:36;"the Democratic Party."
16:36;16:38;"Does that mean all of them would have become Democrats?"
16:38;16:39;"No."
16:39;16:40;"Does that mean all of them would have voted for Bernie?"
16:40;16:41;"No."
16:41;16:42;"So yeah, maybe she still would have won."
16:42;16:43;"Maybe it would have been closer."
16:43;16:44;"Yeah, for sure."
16:44;16:45;"But I don't know."
16:45;16:47;"You know, actually, this whole experience of getting"
16:47;16:50;"into flame wars with these kind of mediocre establishment"
16:50;16:52;"journalists, it actually made me feel a lot of things."
16:52;16:53;"One was--"
16:53;16:54;"Wait, is that what happened?"
16:54;16:56;"Oh, yeah, I got into flame wars."
16:56;16:58;"Let's put a pin in that."
16:59;16:59;"Play some music."
16:59;17:00;"[music - ""jungle love""]"
17:00;17:03;"I, I've been watching you."
17:03;17:05;"I think I want to know you."
17:05;17:07;"Know you."
17:07;17:11;"I said I, I'm real dangerous."
17:11;17:13;"Girl, I've learned to show you."
17:13;17:14;"Show you."

17:35;17:37;"I think I want to drive it."
17:37;17:39;"Drive it."
17:39;17:41;"I ain't pleased at all."
17:41;17:43;"You're a little dangerous."
17:43;17:45;"Take to my crib and rip it off."
17:45;17:46;"Huh."
17:46;17:47;"Jungle love."

18:08;18:10;"You want to make love or what?"
18:10;18:12;"Oh, me, oh, me, oh."
18:12;18:16;"I want to take you to a cage."
18:16;18:18;"Lock you up and hide the key."
18:18;18:20;"Oh, me, oh, me, oh."
18:20;18:23;"You are on the get wilder, babe."
18:23;18:26;"Because if you're hungry, take a bite of me."

18:48;18:49;"I think I want to know you."
18:49;18:51;"Know you."
18:51;18:54;"Jungle love."
18:54;18:56;"Oh, me, oh, me, oh."
18:56;18:57;"Girl, I think I want to show you."
18:57;18:58;"Show you."
18:58;18:59;"I think I want to find you."
18:59;19:01;"Hey, Jesse."
19:01;19:03;"Now, Jerome."
19:03;19:06;"Yes."
19:06;19:07;"Oh, me, oh, me, oh."
19:07;19:08;"Check it out."
19:10;19:13;"I kind of feel like with the Flame Wars,"
19:13;19:14;"I try never to start them."
19:14;19:16;"I don't think I've ever truly started one."
19:16;19:17;"But if somebody comes at you, you"
19:17;19:21;"have a right to be at least 20% meaner back, right?"
19:21;19:24;"So is it like, yo, you're a rock musician."
19:24;19:25;"You don't know anything."
19:25;19:26;"Why are you weighing in?"
19:26;19:27;"I've gotten some of that."
19:27;19:30;"I mean, there's one dude who just snarkily said,"
19:30;19:31;"oh, this guy's the voice of a generation."
19:31;19:33;"Guess what?"
19:33;19:36;"New York's had a closed primary for 40 years."
19:36;19:39;"And that's kind of like a lot of whack stuff"
19:39;19:43;"has existed for 40 years, like you, you old herb."
19:43;19:45;"That doesn't mean we've got to be psyched about it."
19:45;19:47;"He was a little bit like, no, no, whatever."
19:47;19:49;"And then I made a joke about him looking like Moby."
19:49;19:50;"Is he 40?"
19:50;19:51;"I don't know."
19:51;19:53;"I just looked at his picture."
19:53;19:55;"He looked like he was probably in his early 50s or something."
19:55;19:57;"It's just like that smug attitude."
19:57;20:01;"It's like, you know, if like a music journalist"
20:01;20:04;"has a smug attitude about voting or whatever,"
20:04;20:06;"but it's like these are journalists who cover politics."
20:06;20:09;"They get so caught up in the gamesmanship of it."
20:09;20:12;"It's kind of like, ah, interesting."
20:12;20:13;"I don't know."
20:13;20:13;"It's important."
20:13;20:14;"People should be able to vote."
20:14;20:17;"And again, it also made me realize"
20:17;20:19;"how important it is not to be so hung up"
20:19;20:21;"on the candidate you like."
20:21;20:22;"Yeah, of course."
20:22;20:25;"I mean, look, if Bernie loses and Hillary,"
20:25;20:26;"we're going to put pressure on Hillary"
20:26;20:29;"to do the things that we hoped that Bernie would do."
20:29;20:30;"Like, life will go on."
20:30;20:33;"You're not allegiant to the cult of personality."
20:33;20:36;"Maybe we touched on this last time a little bit."
20:36;20:37;"I'm trying not to be, and I better not be."
20:37;20:39;"So basically, I'm saying Hillary's inaugurated."
20:39;20:41;"Look in my eyes."
20:41;20:43;"What do you see?"
20:43;20:45;"The cult of personality."
20:45;20:47;"I'm saying Hillary's inaugurated."
20:47;20:49;"She gets on the phone."
20:49;20:52;"She calls me and says, hey, Ezra, guess what?"
20:52;20:55;"I'm going to start treating Palestinians like human beings."
20:55;20:57;"And she says, but first, you got to do something for me."
20:57;20:58;"You got to drive up to Burlington."
20:58;21:01;"You got to destroy Bernie's house."
21:01;21:03;"Rocks through the window."
21:03;21:04;"You got to--"
21:04;21:05;"This is the weirdest hypothetical."
21:05;21:07;"You got to tear up the couch."
21:07;21:10;"And Bernie will come down and be like, Ezra, man,"
21:10;21:12;"I thought you were my surrogate."
21:12;21:13;"And I'll say, not anymore, Bernie, because you know what?"
21:13;21:14;"This isn't about you, man."
21:14;21:17;"This is about America treating the Palestinians"
21:17;21:17;"like human beings."
21:17;21:19;"I mean, this is a crazy example."
21:19;21:20;"Hillary's like, you know what?"
21:20;21:23;"I'm going to get real universal health care."
21:23;21:25;"But you have to prank call Bernie."
21:25;21:28;"And it's going to be a mean-spirited prank call."
21:28;21:30;"I'm saying, like, that's the stuff that's important, right?"
21:30;21:31;"Absolutely."
21:31;21:33;"And if that means that we would have to humiliate Bernie"
21:33;21:36;"by just a diabolical prank call, I'm going to do it."
21:36;21:37;"But it does-- it begs the question,"
21:37;21:40;"why is Hillary making me do this?"
21:40;21:42;"It certainly begs the question."
21:50;21:52;"Have you ever met a frequent flyer"
21:52;21:54;"dressed in all white attire?"
21:54;21:58;"Slipping on a grace papaya, want to take you higher?"
21:58;22:00;"Jet lag, you must be tired."
22:00;22:02;"Watch out, you might misfire."
22:02;22:06;"Anything your heart desires, want to take you higher?"
22:06;22:09;"Influential new industrial security."
22:09;22:17;"Presidential real utensils priority."
22:21;22:22;"Higher."
22:24;22:26;"1, 2, 3, you and me."
22:26;22:29;"Can you move at my velocity?"
22:29;22:30;"Higher."
22:31;22:33;"Higher."
22:33;22:34;"Don't miss the beat."
22:34;22:37;"First class seat on my fleet."
22:37;22:40;"When you hear the beat, when you feel the need,"
22:40;22:42;"turn the cabin pressure on."
22:42;22:44;"Hurry, because I'll soon be gone."
22:45;22:48;"Now let's go to the ""Time Crisis"" hotline."
22:48;22:49;"Hello."
22:49;22:50;"Hey, what's up, Dave?"
22:50;22:52;"You're on ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra and Jake."
22:52;22:54;"Hello, hello."
22:54;22:57;"So we're calling all of our friends and friends of ""Time"
22:57;23:00;"Crisis"" to talk about the horrible tragedy of Prince"
23:00;23:01;"dying."
23:01;23:06;"And I know that you, as one half of Chromio, a true funk lord,"
23:06;23:09;"I know that Prince means a lot to you."
23:09;23:11;"Certainly does."
23:11;23:13;"So you've been a fan, what, your whole life?"
23:13;23:14;"Pretty much."
23:14;23:18;"I remember, like, watching the video for ""When the Dubs Cry"""
23:18;23:21;"when I was, like, probably, like, six years old or something."
23:21;23:24;"Is it fair to say that Prince is an influence on Chromio?"
23:24;23:26;"Yeah, probably, like, the biggest one."
23:26;23:29;"Him and, you know, Hall & Oates and Zapp."
23:29;23:33;"So probably the biggest one, though, because, like, you"
23:33;23:38;"know, songwriter and producer and, like, guitar shredder."
23:38;23:41;"So all around, you know, the aesthetic"
23:41;23:44;"is probably what has marked us the most."
23:44;23:46;"Do you have, like, a favorite era of Prince?"
23:46;23:49;"No, they're all really good, because, like, the early stuff,"
23:49;23:53;"you know, like, the early, like, ""Why You Want to Treat Me So"
23:53;23:56;"Bad,"" ""I Want to Be Your Lover"" stuff is amazing, because,"
23:56;23:57;"like, he's playing every instrument."
23:57;24:00;"And, you know, it's got more, like, of an early '80s, like,"
24:00;24:01;"rock feel."
24:01;24:03;"And then after that, like, the lindrum."
24:03;24:06;"And then the lindrum comes in after that, which is, you know,"
24:06;24:09;"then that sort of defines, like, the Purple Wayne sound."
24:09;24:14;"Like, all the lindrum is, like, probably the peak of Prince."
24:14;24:17;"Like, but then after that, you've"
24:17;24:22;"got the really sus '90s stuff, which is amazing, too,"
24:22;24:23;"you know?"
24:23;24:27;"All the way to, you know, ""Could You Be the Most Beautiful"
24:27;24:27;"Thing in the World."""
24:27;24:28;"I mean, that's fire."
24:28;24:29;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
24:29;24:31;"That was, like, mid-'90s, right, that song?"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah, like, ""Can't Sleep on New Power Generation,"""
24:33;24:34;"and then, like, ""Bad Dance,"" you know,"
24:34;24:36;"""Can't Sleep on the Bad Dance."""
24:36;24:40;"So, like, I think all the eras are incredible."
24:40;24:45;"I mean, and then recently, like, in the last few years,"
24:45;24:49;"he did a couple of kind of interesting return-to-form"
24:49;24:52;"albums where he broke out the lindrum again,"
24:52;24:56;"and it was all, like, all that kind of lindrum sound"
24:56;24:58;"and, like, really dirty guitar, just, like, direct--"
24:58;25:00;"plugged in direct, no amp."
25:00;25:02;"But I was even a fan of, like, ""Black Sweat,"""
25:02;25:06;"which probably came out in, like, 2006, I think."
25:06;25:07;"And I really like that song, too."
25:07;25:09;"You're keeping up on Prince all the way through."
25:09;25:11;"Yeah, big time."
25:11;25:13;"Did you guys ever see Prince or cross paths with him?"
25:13;25:14;"P did, yeah."
25:14;25:16;"We were at Montreux Festival."
25:16;25:19;"Actually, remember you and I hung out over there?"
25:19;25:21;"Oh, yeah, we had lunch at the Jazz Festival in Switzerland."
25:21;25:22;"Right."
25:22;25:23;"Correct."
25:23;25:26;"So during that same stint, we did a show"
25:26;25:30;"where it was in true Swiss Montreux form."
25:30;25:35;"It was Janelle Monae, Jamie Lydell, and then us."
25:35;25:39;"And P was, like, side stage watching Janelle Monae."
25:39;25:43;"And out of, like, a garage door comes Prince."
25:43;25:45;"You know, like, the garage door opens,"
25:45;25:47;"and, like, smoke comes out, and then Prince comes out."
25:47;25:48;"And then he was-- and then he was"
25:48;25:50;"watching her from side stage."
25:50;25:52;"And so that was P's encounter with Prince."
25:52;25:53;"I never saw him."
25:53;25:55;"But I share the same birthday as him."
25:55;25:56;"Oh, really?"
25:56;25:58;"June 7."
25:58;25:59;"That's a serious funk birthday."
25:59;26:01;"Correct."
26:01;26:02;"We have one last question."
26:02;26:03;"What's your favorite Prince song?"
26:03;26:06;"I know you're a true deep fan, so I know it's going to be hard."
26:06;26:08;"But if you had to pick one."
26:08;26:10;"My favorite stuff is still the hits, though."
26:10;26:12;"Like, I'm not-- you know, like, I don't really"
26:12;26:15;"listen to the deep cuts that much."
26:15;26:16;"I really like the hits."
26:16;26:18;"I mean, my favorite ones, ""I Would Die For You,"""
26:18;26:20;"but, like, if I had a request or whatever,"
26:20;26:22;"you know, to kind of vibe to one now,"
26:22;26:24;"it would probably be, like, ""Lady Cab Driver."""
26:24;26:25;"That's a good one."
26:25;26:27;"Every-- you know, ""Lady Cab Driver"""
26:27;26:28;"is an amazing one."
26:28;26:30;"The snare in that song is crazy."
26:30;26:31;"All right, Dave."
26:31;26:32;"Well, good talking to you."
26:32;26:33;"Thank you, Rez."
26:33;26:34;"Best of P, thug."
26:34;26:35;"I'll see you soon."
26:35;26:36;"That's right."
26:36;26:37;"Easy."
26:37;26:38;"Bye."
26:38;26:39;"[music - del shannon, ""bonafide""]"
26:39;26:40;"There's no surprise."
26:40;26:42;"What you need is an older guy with a little bit"
26:42;26:44;"of life experience."
26:44;26:46;"The right clothes and the right appearance."
26:46;26:48;"Who would go with not feel nice?"
26:48;26:49;"Hop in with a candlelight."
26:49;26:51;"And really, when it gets down to it,"
26:51;26:53;"the commander's down to fight."
26:53;26:57;"I'll give you bona fide lovin', oh, oh, oh,"
26:57;27:01;"the type that makes me feel old."
27:01;27:05;"I'll give you bona fide lovin', oh, oh, oh,"
27:05;27:08;"the type that makes me feel old."
27:08;27:08;"Ow."
27:08;27:19;"Eat, go down in the DM time crisis"
27:19;27:22;"with Ezra Koenig on Beat Squad."

27:27;27:29;"Let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."
27:29;27:31;"Let me rock you, that's all I want to do."
27:31;27:33;"Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."
27:33;27:34;"Let me rock you, got a feel for you."
27:34;27:36;"Chaka Khan, would you tell me what you want to do?"
27:36;27:38;"Do you feel for me, or do you feel for you?"
27:38;27:40;"Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do."
27:40;27:42;"I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too."
27:42;27:44;"And let me take you in my arms, let me feel you with my charm,"
27:44;27:46;"Chaka, because you know that I'm the one to keep you warm,"
27:46;27:46;"Chaka."
27:46;27:48;"I make you warm, it's just a physical dream."
27:48;27:50;"I want to rock you, Chaka, baby, but you make me want to scream."
27:50;27:52;"Let me rock you, rock you."
27:56;28:15;"Baby, baby, when I look at you, I feel warmth inside."
28:15;28:23;"There's something about the things you do that keeps me satisfied."
28:23;28:26;"I want to love you, baby."
28:26;28:30;"It's mainly a physical thing."
28:30;28:38;"The feeling that I have with you, baby, makes me want to sing."
28:38;28:41;"I feel for you."
28:41;28:43;"I think I love you."

29:10;29:15;"there's no place I'd never be."
29:15;29:22;"I can't believe that it's true, the things that you do to me."
29:22;29:25;"I wouldn't lie to you, baby."
29:25;29:29;"I'm seriously trying to you."
29:29;29:33;"The feeling that I have with you, baby,"
29:33;29:37;"there's nothing that I wouldn't do."

32:53;32:55;"And I love you."
32:58;33:03;"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion."
33:03;33:05;"So we were talking about flame wars earlier."
33:05;33:06;"Yeah."
33:06;33:08;"Do you know what a flame war is, Jake?"
33:08;33:09;"Yeah."
33:09;33:11;"Not a huge internet guy, but--"
33:11;33:13;"No, but I mean, I have a Twitter account."
33:13;33:14;"What is a flame war?"
33:14;33:15;"Can you figure it out?"
33:15;33:17;"Yeah, you get in an argument with someone on Twitter."
33:17;33:18;"And it goes back and forth."
33:18;33:19;"And people follow it."
33:19;33:20;"And you know."
33:20;33:21;"All right."
33:21;33:22;"That's--"
33:22;33:26;"It's like a not very civil or articulate argument."
33:26;33:27;"Yes."
33:27;33:28;"A lot of pithy one-liners."
33:28;33:29;"Yeah, exactly."
33:29;33:34;"And arguably, no war is noble."
33:34;33:36;"There's no such thing as a noble war."
33:36;33:38;"Although I do want to point out that I believe that--"
33:38;33:39;"OK."
33:39;33:42;"--individual men and women can distinguish themselves"
33:42;33:45;"on the battlefield with acts of incredible bravery."
33:45;33:46;"But I'm saying like--"
33:46;33:48;"I thought we were talking about Twitter."
33:48;33:51;"OK, but what I'm trying to say is, obviously, I support the troops."
33:51;33:54;"And I do think that individuals can distinguish themselves"
33:54;33:56;"with noble acts of bravery on the battlefield."
33:56;33:59;"But war is already a dicey concept,"
33:59;34:03;"using violence to accomplish some kind of political--"
34:03;34:04;"Security."
34:04;34:05;"--security or whatever."
34:05;34:07;"So war already is not a very noble concept."
34:07;34:12;"But flame war is especially an ignoble concept."
34:12;34:14;"I think that's how most people feel."
34:14;34:16;"I was in a fairly big flame war--"
34:16;34:17;"Yeah."
34:17;34:18;"--with a music journalist."
34:18;34:20;"A rock writer?"
34:20;34:21;"A rock critic."
34:21;34:22;"OK."
34:22;34:25;"I was vaguely aware of who this guy was."
34:25;34:28;"His name is Zachary Lepez."
34:28;34:30;"You know, I didn't know much about him."
34:30;34:32;"I knew that he was a writer who'd written a little bit for Pitchfork"
34:32;34:34;"and some other things."
34:34;34:38;"And here and there, I'd seen him just kind of like diss us."
34:38;34:41;"Here's some of his tweets that our producers pulled up."
34:41;34:43;"This is from back in the day."
34:43;34:46;"He wrote one in November 2014."
34:46;34:50;"""Not going to listen to Jaden Smith album, but I have my review done."
34:50;34:51;"Ready?"
34:51;34:52;"OK."
34:52;34:55;"Objectively speaking, better than Vampire Weekend."
34:55;34:58;"I mean, look, it got two retweets and five likes."
34:58;34:59;"Modest."
34:59;35:02;"That makes my blood boil that it got two retweets and five likes."
35:02;35:05;"I mean, obviously, they're-- look, he was just making us a punchline."
35:05;35:06;"Uh-huh."
35:06;35:08;"That Vampire Weekend sucks so bad that even this thing that he hasn't listened to"
35:08;35:09;"is worse than it."
35:09;35:11;"I mean, I'm willing to believe that Jaden's album is better than Vampire Weekend."
35:11;35:13;"You know I love Jaden."
35:13;35:14;"Let's hear another one."
35:14;35:21;"In February 2015, he wrote, ""Loving Vampire Weekend is like--"
35:22;35:24;"Loving Vampire Weekend is like loving the Clintons."
35:24;35:25;"I'm going to bed now."
35:25;35:27;"Angel emoji."
35:27;35:29;"One retweet, five likes."
35:29;35:31;"Whoever retweeted that, man, I'm--"
35:31;35:34;"I'm actually more mad at the retweeter than at him."""
35:34;35:35;"So that's pretty funny."
35:35;35:36;"That one's pretty funny."
35:36;35:38;"That he was comparing us to the Clintons back then."
35:38;35:41;"OK, here's one more he wrote in April 2015."
35:41;35:43;"He's going in on us."
35:43;35:48;"""Vampire Weekend smart is the dumbest smart."""
35:48;35:50;"Weird going in on-- in 2015, too."
35:51;35:51;"Yeah, that's pretty deep."
35:51;35:53;"The last record was what, 2013?"
35:53;35:54;"2013. We'd been around."
35:54;35:56;"And then somebody else is saying they hate them."
35:56;35:58;"And then he says, ""Oh, I don't hate them."""
35:58;35:59;"Oh, I didn't see this."
35:59;36:00;"He says, ""I don't hate them."
36:00;36:01;"He has a pretty voice."
36:01;36:03;"But they rep what I hate hard."""
36:03;36:05;"All right, if I'd seen that, I would have softened."
36:05;36:06;"So whatever."
36:06;36:09;"He's trying to say that we're like this kind of pretentious band."
36:09;36:12;"We're smart, but we're not really smart."
36:12;36:13;"We suck."
36:13;36:15;"So I ignored all those tweets."
36:15;36:16;"You got to."
36:16;36:20;"A musician cannot be getting mad at everybody who says your band sucks."
36:20;36:27;"But a little bit later, he wrote something that I could not ignore."
36:27;36:28;"And I got in a flame war with him."
36:28;36:30;"I couldn't resist."
36:30;36:32;"I lashed out on Twitter."
36:32;36:33;"This is about a year ago."
36:33;36:37;"We had this very public dialogue."
36:37;36:39;"And it got out of hand."
36:39;36:43;"But I decided that we needed to meet in person."
36:43;36:47;"So last week, when I was in New York, I sat down with him."
36:47;36:49;"And I recorded an interview."
36:49;36:53;"So I want to play my interview with a man."
36:53;36:55;"This is me meeting him in person for the first time."
36:55;36:56;"So this is from last week."
36:56;37:01;"I sat down with Zachary Lopez to talk about our flame war."
37:01;37:02;"And this is what happened."
37:02;37:06;"Time Crisis Enemies."
37:06;37:07;"What's up?"
37:07;37:10;"I'm here doing some investigative journalism with Zachary Lopez."
37:10;37:11;"What's up, Zach?"
37:11;37:12;"Hey, Ezra."
37:12;37:14;"So I'm meeting you for the first time."
37:14;37:15;"Yeah."
37:15;37:16;"Because we once had beef."
37:16;37:17;"We did."
37:17;37:20;"And this season, we're increasingly trying to bring people who had beef together, especially internet beef."
37:20;37:22;"So this is the first time we're meeting IRL."
37:22;37:23;"Yeah."
37:23;37:27;"So let's explain how we came to have beef."
37:27;37:30;"And did we have a flame war on Twitter?"
37:30;37:32;"It was a pretty low-grade flame war."
37:32;37:38;"But I certainly was getting notifications from your fans for about a month and a half later."
37:38;37:40;"Shout out to the fans."
37:40;37:43;"I think that counts to a certain extent."
37:43;37:44;"I mean, we kept it pretty civil."
37:44;37:47;"Yeah, we did keep it pretty civil, which I think is why we can actually come face to face."
37:47;37:52;"I mean, I understand that there's different power dynamics with different critics and different musicians."
37:52;38:05;"When someone who has like 7 million followers calls some young woman that has 150 followers and just wrote something on her blog and calls her a dick or something."
38:05;38:07;"And then I think that could be abusive."
38:07;38:12;"But I think I'm 40, and I'm just an old man."
38:12;38:17;"I think it's well within your purview to take issue with that."
38:17;38:21;"I think it's well within your purview to take issue with anything a critic says, and then they can have a conversation or not."
38:21;38:28;"And I appreciated that in our low-grade flame war, you never shamed me for merely talking to you."
38:28;38:33;"Which is something that happens on the Internet a lot, is that somebody says something that provokes somebody else, and somebody is provoked."
38:33;38:35;"And say, ""Why did you say something provocative? I disagree."""
38:35;38:37;"And the person says, ""Why do you care? Leave me alone."""
38:37;38:38;"So, Ed, you didn't do that."
38:38;38:40;"So let's explain how this started."
38:40;38:41;"I'm pretty great."
38:41;38:42;"Yes, you are."
38:42;38:44;"First of all, I should say I'm a fan of music journalism."
38:44;38:46;"I was once a music journalist myself."
38:46;38:50;"I wrote one review for Dusted magazine."
38:50;38:51;"Are you familiar with Dusted?"
38:51;38:52;"Yeah, sure."
38:52;38:54;"I wrote a test review."
38:54;38:56;"Is that Doug Moss's Ross Rock?"
38:56;38:58;"Yeah, I think he was involved in that."
38:58;39:03;"I wrote one test review of Dirty Projectors' albums before I ever met anybody in Dirty Projectors, and they published it."
39:03;39:04;"Although they changed some things."
39:04;39:05;"Was it a positive review?"
39:05;39:06;"Yeah, it was positive."
39:06;39:09;"And I wasn't very happy with some of the changes they made, but whatever."
39:09;39:10;"I love music journalism."
39:10;39:14;"It's formed the way I think about music, and I'm a former music journalist myself."
39:14;39:16;"Let's put a pin in that. Play some music."

42:50;42:53;"Time Crisis Enemies."
42:53;42:55;"So I knew who you were from following music journals."
42:55;42:57;"You sometimes write for Pitchfork."
42:57;42:58;"Mm-hmm."
42:58;42:59;"Vice."
42:59;43:01;"Yeah, I want to clarify that I don't do reviews for Pitchfork."
43:01;43:02;"You don't do-- oh, really?"
43:02;43:04;"I only did humor."
43:04;43:05;"Oh, okay."
43:05;43:06;"Or quote, unquote humor."
43:06;43:08;"Right, okay, and so you also write for Vice."
43:08;43:09;"Yeah."
43:09;43:11;"Oh, I didn't know for sure, but I had a feeling"
43:11;43:13;"you made some snarky comments about Vampire Weekend before."
43:13;43:15;"But again, nothing that-- nothing that seemed, like,"
43:15;43:16;"truly offensive."
43:16;43:18;"Everybody likes different stuff, and, you know,"
43:18;43:19;"nothing that bothered me."
43:19;43:20;"But so here's what bothered me."
43:20;43:25;"I heard a friend tells me, ""Did you read this essay?"""
43:25;43:27;"About New York that was in Vice."
43:27;43:28;"And I said, ""No."""
43:28;43:29;"He said, ""Oh, it's going kind of viral."""
43:29;43:31;"And essentially, my friend said, ""It's an essay about how"
43:31;43:33;"everybody's moving to LA, but they're never"
43:33;43:34;"going to move to LA."
43:34;43:36;"They're loyal to New York, and they're talking about a lot"
43:36;43:40;"of things like gentrification and, you know,"
43:40;43:43;"why they love New York and why they think moving to LA"
43:43;43:44;"is corny or something."""
43:44;43:45;"Tell me if I'm--"
43:45;43:48;"It was-- it's a tough one because I think a lot of times"
43:48;43:51;"when people say, like, ""Oh, it was just a joke,"" you know,"
43:51;43:54;"that's a way of sort of-- then you can't take issue with it"
43:54;43:55;"because I was kidding."
43:55;43:56;"Right."
43:56;43:59;"But it was-- and perhaps it failed at this--"
43:59;44:02;"it was intended to be a humorous essay, you know,"
44:02;44:03;"touching on serious things."
44:03;44:07;"I mean, basically, Vice wrote me or called me up and was like,"
44:07;44:09;"""Hey, will you write an essay about how you're never"
44:09;44:10;"going to leave New York?"""
44:10;44:11;"So-- but I mean, yeah, I think--"
44:11;44:12;"No, and here's the thing."
44:12;44:13;"And here's the thing."
44:13;44:16;"So then my friend says, ""Yeah, my brother really liked it."
44:16;44:18;"These are, like, lifelong New Yorker types."""
44:18;44:20;"But there's this one part where they kind of diss"
44:20;44:21;"Vampire Weekend."
44:21;44:22;"And this is before I even-- I knew who wrote it."
44:22;44:23;"I heard about it."
44:23;44:25;"And I was like, ""Oh, no."
44:25;44:26;"What did they say?"
44:26;44:27;"I don't remember."
44:27;44:28;"You should go look at it."""
44:28;44:29;"So when I got home, I looked at it."
44:29;44:31;"He totally remembered what it was."
44:31;44:33;"He just said he didn't want to be the person to tell you."
44:33;44:34;"Perhaps."
44:34;44:37;"So then I see it, and then I'm like, ""I don't even know."""
44:37;44:40;"Somehow, I saw that basically there's a part in it where he"
44:40;44:43;"said to everybody who's moving to LA, ""Take Vampire Weekend"
44:43;44:44;"with you."""
44:44;44:45;"And let's be clear."
44:45;44:46;"It was a throwaway line."
44:46;44:47;"I know-- OK."
44:47;44:49;"I know it was a throwaway line."
44:49;44:52;"But because the essay had elements of humor, but also"
44:52;44:55;"it was on serious topics, it bothered me more than normal."
44:55;45:01;"And also, I think at one point I saw that the music critic--"
45:01;45:02;"Jessica Hopper."
45:02;45:03;"--Jessica Hopper had specifically"
45:03;45:04;"highlighted that line."
45:04;45:06;"And I have nothing against Jessica Hopper."
45:06;45:08;"She is a great journalist."
45:08;45:10;"Well, I do want to just-- just because I was going to say this"
45:10;45:12;"at some point because I knew it would come up."
45:12;45:15;"I do want to say that I think a lot of the criticism you guys"
45:15;45:16;"have gotten is unfair."
45:16;45:18;"Some of the criticism you've gotten from me"
45:18;45:20;"is unfair because I do--"
45:20;45:23;"Take-- I certainly have always aspired"
45:23;45:25;"to be more of just a writer, period."
45:25;45:27;"And I know that sounds really pretentious."
45:27;45:29;"But I'm kind of pretentious."
45:29;45:30;"And I--"
45:30;45:31;"Me too."
45:31;45:33;"Yeah, I mean, more than I want to be a music writer."
45:33;45:34;"So I've always been more interested in,"
45:34;45:35;"is this entertaining to read?"
45:35;45:37;"Is this stylistically interesting?"
45:37;45:39;"Seeing somebody who I knew had negative feelings"
45:39;45:42;"toward Vampire Weekend-- and I'm not questioning her credentials"
45:42;45:45;"as a critic-- specifically shout out this line"
45:45;45:47;"as if it was this really funny thing."
45:47;45:49;"""Take Vampire Weekend with you."""
45:49;45:54;"Again, I have to say, I think it's really corny when--"
45:54;45:57;"and I see this all the time-- you get a bad review."
45:57;45:59;"And then somebody writes, ""You know,"
45:59;46:01;"it's OK not to like my band, but actually your grammar"
46:01;46:02;"is terrible."
46:02;46:06;"And actually, you don't know what syncopation really means."
46:06;46:08;"And you don't know what a half note is."""
46:08;46:09;"And I think that's so corny."
46:09;46:11;"It's so condescending when it's like,"
46:11;46:13;"somebody didn't like your music."
46:13;46:15;"Trust me, I know people don't-- not everybody"
46:15;46:16;"likes Vampire Weekend."
46:16;46:18;"And even just to say Vampire Weekend sucks,"
46:18;46:20;"Vampire Weekend's corny, my voice is wack--"
46:20;46:23;"all that stuff I've, over the years,"
46:23;46:24;"been able to deal with."
46:24;46:26;"The reason it set me off-- and I think"
46:26;46:28;"it's because I saw this line highlighted"
46:28;46:31;"by another somewhat well-known music journalist--"
46:31;46:32;"I was like, hmm."
46:32;46:35;"I know this is supposed to be like a satirical piece,"
46:35;46:40;"but it hit home for me because I felt that Vampire Weekend"
46:40;46:46;"is somehow symptomatic of new, horrible,"
46:46;46:48;"capitalist New York that's driving out"
46:48;46:50;"real New Yorkers and stuff."
46:50;46:52;"I think that's a fair way of taking it."
46:52;46:55;"It's not-- it wasn't my intention."
46:55;46:57;"I've, over the years, taken a lot of pleasure"
46:57;47:01;"out of disliking your band, but obviously--"
47:01;47:04;"but just in a sort of general, almost theoretical way."
47:04;47:06;"Yeah, like everybody needs their punchline."
47:06;47:07;"Right."
47:07;47:08;"I have my punchlines."
47:08;47:10;"I can't say them publicly, but I have my punchlines."
47:10;47:11;"Of course, I have that luxury."

51:38;51:40;"Yeah, you discuss this stuff, but then sometimes you"
51:40;51:42;"feel like-- you talk about it in one interview"
51:42;51:45;"with a sympathetic journalist, but sometimes you feel like,"
51:45;51:46;"eh, whatever."

51:53;51:55;"This made me really reactive."

51:56;51:58;"I mean, I thought one of the things that"
51:58;52:01;"was interesting when we were emailing back and forth was--"
52:01;52:03;"and I thought really a point that you sort of made to me"
52:03;52:06;"that kind of made me kind of wince because it was a fair--"
52:06;52:08;"Yeah."
52:08;52:09;"I don't think you were even trying to take a jab at me,"
52:09;52:10;"but you were sort of saying, it's"
52:10;52:12;"just having someone who moved here for the arts"
52:12;52:15;"and the culture, like I did, and then"
52:15;52:17;"to be sort of taking jabs at someone who is certainly"
52:17;52:21;"more from here than I am, who is--"
52:21;52:23;"Yeah, and I don't even like getting into that, like, who's--"
52:23;52:25;"Yeah, but it's a-- you can, though."
52:25;52:26;"It's our history."
52:26;52:27;"I've always thought, like, who's a real New Yorker,"
52:27;52:29;"who's not a New Yorker?"

52:48;52:50;"part-- you know, I'm from the tri-state area."
52:50;52:51;"I'm--"
52:51;52:52;"No, New Jersey-- New Jersey hardcore"
52:52;52:54;"is an essential part of New York."
52:54;52:56;"Yeah, and also I think--"
52:56;52:57;"There would be no Rorschach if it weren't for New Jersey."
52:57;52:59;"And I think I said to you in the thing"
52:59;53:05;"that it's hard to shake that feeling that when you see"
53:05;53:06;"somebody make a joke and part of your brain"
53:06;53:08;"tells you it's a throwaway joke and part of you"
53:08;53:10;"has a feeling like, this person hates me."
53:10;53:11;"Sure."
53:11;53:12;"I have an enemy."
53:12;53:13;"And in fact, that's something I also want to talk about"
53:13;53:15;"is because one thing that's been interesting to me"
53:15;53:18;"about Twitter, which in many ways ruins lives--"
53:18;53:19;"Yeah."
53:19;53:23;"--causes anxiety, depression, or let's say exacerbates."
53:23;53:24;"Exacerbates, yeah."
53:24;53:25;"It really--"
53:25;53:26;"Romanticizes."
53:26;53:27;"Romanticizes."
53:27;53:28;"It's a brutal place in many ways."
53:28;53:30;"But one thing that I like about it is because deep down,"
53:30;53:31;"I always--"
53:31;53:32;"I love Twitter."
53:32;53:35;"I never fully bought into this whole musicians versus critics"
53:35;53:37;"as like natural enemies."
53:37;53:39;"Because straight up, there's a side of me"
53:39;53:40;"that's a music critic."
53:40;53:42;"And I even feel like I only wrote one review."
53:42;53:44;"Technically, I wrote two reviews."
53:44;53:46;"But also, the way I think about music"
53:46;53:51;"is so deeply formed by growing up, reading, zines,"
53:51;53:54;"even Rolling Stone magnet--"
53:54;53:55;"subscription magnet."
53:55;53:56;"It's so deeply formed by music criticism"
53:57;53:59;"that I really think music criticism and making music"
53:59;54:01;"are so tied to similar thought processes."
54:01;54:03;"You're a musician and a critic."
54:03;54:06;"So I never liked this kind of false dichotomy of like,"
54:06;54:09;"well, you got the critics who wish they were musicians."
54:09;54:11;"Then you got the musicians doing something pure."
54:11;54:12;"And they naturally hate each other."
54:12;54:14;"And it's been interesting to me to sometimes--"
54:14;54:16;"it's been good to remind myself--"
54:16;54:18;"I follow a lot of music journalists on Twitter."
54:18;54:22;"Because deep down, even though some of them don't like me,"
54:22;54:23;"those are my people."
54:23;54:25;"I like the way that music journalists think."
54:25;54:27;"And sometimes I see the way that music journalists--"
54:27;54:29;"they have their own haters, too."
54:29;54:30;"Oh, yeah."
54:30;54:31;"I think Twitter made everybody--"
54:31;54:34;"it used to be the musicians were the most vulnerable."
54:34;54:36;"But now everybody's vulnerable in a similar way."
54:36;54:39;"Now that a lot of critics sort of operate more"
54:39;54:44;"as cheerleaders for musicians, until one musician stumbles,"
54:44;54:46;"and then they all pile on."
54:46;54:49;"But generally, they're all like, they're about being positive."
54:49;54:52;"Now they just really attack each other."
54:52;54:55;"Because on Twitter, we're all just individuals."
54:55;54:57;"Whether your background is making music, writing bad music,"

01:11:12;01:11:14;"we enjoyed talking to each other."
01:11:14;01:11:17;"So we were like, let's go get some food and some brews."

01:12:01;01:12:03;"that Christgau had written about him."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Like, just cast--"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"I can just picture that, just like-- just"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"in between songs, just like-- he was like the original Kanye."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Billy Joel just like ranting on stage."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Just like, get a load of this guy."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Oh, he says that I'm cheesy."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"I'm not as deep as Springsteen."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Wow."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"Well, who made him the king of rock and roll?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"You know what, though?"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Here's one thing."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"If Billy had sat down with Robert Christgau and said,"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"you know what, man?"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"You've been talking all this to me."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Yeah."
01:12:31;01:12:36;"I'm just like a young, Italian-identifying Jewish man,"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"and you're getting my foot in the door,"
01:12:38;01:12:39;"and you're hurting my feelings."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"And Christgau's like, you know what, man?"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Now that I see you, and I know you're a good guy who's just"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"trying to get out there and get his name out there,"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"I'm going to stop clowning on you."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"Maybe we wouldn't have gotten some of those classic angry"
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Billy songs, like, still rock and roll to me."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Like, all that anger would have just been like, gone."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Well, thank God that didn't happen, then."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"I know."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"So, yeah, so like, you start playing with--"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"you go back in your time machine."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"Who knows?"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"I mean, but I also feel like Christgau--"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"I don't know a ton about him, but I feel like he"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"was just like-- maybe I'm just like, romanticizing the old,"
01:13:09;01:13:13;"like, kind of like, almost famous sort of vision"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"of a rock writer."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Right, that he would have just been like, no."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"It's like, almost like, moral or ethical."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"He'd be like, this is my opinion on your band."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"You suck, and I'm never going to back down on it."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"So anyway, we could talk about critics and musicians forever,"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"and we'll probably-- I want to get some more critics"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"on the show."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"Hopefully not all people I had flame wars with, but you know."
01:13:32;01:13:36;"Again, I believe it's all people who love music,"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"and making it, talking about it, listening to it."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"We all love music."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"So here's Billy Joel with ""Still Rock and Rolling With Me."""
01:13:42;01:13:44;"What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?"
01:13:44;01:13:49;"Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"Maybe I should buy some old tab collars."
01:13:51;01:13:55;"Welcome back to the age of jive."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"Where have you been hiding out lately, honey?"
01:13:58;01:14:02;"You can't dress flashy till you spend a lot of money."
01:14:02;01:14:05;"Everybody's talking about the new sound."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"It's funny, but it's still rock and roll to me."
01:14:08;01:14:14;"What's the matter with the car I'm driving?"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"Can't you tell that it's out of style?"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"Should I get a set of white wall tires?"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"Are you going to cruise the miracle mile?"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Nowadays, you can't be too sentimental."
01:14:28;01:14:31;"You're messing with some true baby blue continental."
01:14:31;01:14:35;"Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk,"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"it's still rock and roll to me."
01:14:38;01:14:42;"Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"because it's always been the same old scene."
01:14:45;01:14:49;"There's a new band in town, but you can't get the sound"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"from a story in a magazine."
01:14:52;01:14:55;"Ain't that your average teen?"
01:14:55;01:15:01;"How about a pair of pink sidewinders"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"and a white orange pair of pants?"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"Well, you could really be a bold rumble, baby,"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"if you just give it half a chance."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers."
01:15:15;01:15:18;"You get all mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"Licks, fakes, new wave, dance great."
01:15:21;01:15:25;"Anyways, it's still rock and roll to me."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"All right, speaker!"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"(saxophone solo)"
01:15:30;01:15:49;"What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"Don't you know that they're out of touch?"
01:15:52;01:15:56;"Should I try to be a straight-A student?"
01:15:56;01:16:00;"If you are, then you think too much."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?"
01:16:03;01:16:06;"All you need are looks and a whole lot of money."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"It's the next phase, new wave, dance great."
01:16:09;01:16:13;"Anyways, it's still rock and roll to me."
01:16:13;01:16:16;"Everybody's talking 'bout the new sound, honey,"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"but it's still rock and roll to me."
01:16:19;01:16:23;"You're listening to..."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"(scribbling)"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"Time Crisis."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"On Beat One."
01:16:28;01:16:52;"No wonder I walk by"
01:16:52;01:16:57;"Just an invitation would have been just fine"
01:16:57;01:17:00;"Said no to him again and again"
01:17:00;01:17:05;"First he took my heart, then he ran"
01:17:05;01:17:09;"No one knows how I feel"
01:17:09;01:17:14;"What do I say unless you read between my lines?"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"One man walked away from me"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"First he took my hand"
01:17:20;01:17:25;"Said, ""Baby, stand back, stand back"""
01:17:25;01:17:27;"In the middle of my room"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"I do not hear from you"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"It's all right, it's all right"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"We'll be standing in line"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Standing in line"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"We'll be standing in line"
01:17:42;01:17:46;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Hello?"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"Hi, Rashida. This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Hi, Ezra and Jake. How's it going?"
01:17:52;01:17:57;"Well, we're bummed over here because of the death of musical icon Prince,"
01:17:57;01:18:01;"and we wanted to talk to friends of the show about their relationship to Prince."
01:18:01;01:18:04;"Yeah, it's pretty devastating. I'm pretty sad."
01:18:04;01:18:08;"I mean, I feel like Prince was kind of everything to me for so long,"
01:18:08;01:18:12;"in my childhood especially, but I don't know."
01:18:12;01:18:17;"He was so funky and so perennial, timeless."
01:18:17;01:18:22;"Hit every genre in his own special way."
01:18:22;01:18:28;"Just really, I mean, you know, his contribution is ridiculous."
01:18:28;01:18:31;"It's true. Did you ever meet him?"
01:18:31;01:18:37;"I met him once. I think he, like, by accident showed up at my 30th birthday party,"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"which was a nice accident for me."
01:18:40;01:18:43;"He was a little shy, and I was definitely very shy."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"He was shy?"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"He's a little shy, yeah. He was a little shy."
01:18:47;01:18:51;"He didn't come up and say, and introduce himself and say happy birthday?"
01:18:51;01:18:54;"No, I wouldn't introduce myself."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Really?"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"That's what you do with Prince, yeah."
01:18:57;01:18:58;"You just--"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"Of course."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"It's corny to go introduce yourself to Prince."
01:19:01;01:19:04;"No, I mean, you have to, because he's not going to do it to you."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Oh, you have to?"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Yes, you have to."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"And he said hi."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"I went up and said hi, yeah."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"And what did he say?"
01:19:10;01:19:15;"He said hi. He was sweet. He smiled. I said it was my birthday. He said happy birthday."
01:19:15;01:19:17;"And then he kicked it in the corner."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"And then he vanished?"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"And then he vanished, yeah."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"And it wasn't--"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Yeah."
01:19:22;01:19:25;"Because people always used to say that Prince and Michael Jackson had a rivalry."
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Yeah, that was real."
01:19:26;01:19:30;"So he might have thought, for obvious reasons, that you were team Michael Jackson."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"Oh, that's maybe true, yeah. No, I was very--"
01:19:33;01:19:39;"I feel like my heart was occupied equally by Prince and Michael Jackson for kind of different reasons."
01:19:39;01:19:49;"I feel like, yes, they definitely rivaled each other in their kind of androgynous, sexy, boundary-pushing pop ways."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"But there was something so different about them, you know?"
01:19:53;01:19:58;"Michael kind of had like a childlike thing, and Prince was very much like a sexy man."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Oh, he was, yeah, very grown up."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Yeah, grown up and sexy."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"What's your favorite Prince song, if you had to pick one?"
01:20:05;01:20:12;"It's hard, but I love ""Raspberry Beret,"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" is probably like a tie for me."
01:20:12;01:20:15;"Well, thank you, Rashida, for sharing your thoughts with Prince."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"I know a lot of us are devastated at the loss this week."
01:20:18;01:20:24;"Yeah, thank you for including me. I think the best thing to do now is to just kind of talk about how much we love him."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"True. All right, we'll see you soon."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Thanks, guys."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Bye."

01:21:17;01:21:24;"It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"Okay, Jake, so we're challenging ourselves this time."
01:21:27;01:21:35;"We're going to compare the top five songs on iTunes right now with the top five Billboard hits of the same week in 1968."
01:21:35;01:21:38;"That's awesome. I'm excited about this."
01:21:38;01:21:41;"So 1968 was also a tumultuous year."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"That's why we talked about doing this year, right?"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Because it was an election year."
01:21:44;01:21:47;"Yeah, and there was the Democratic Convention in Chicago."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"Things got real out of hand, bloody."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"Yeah, people were making comparisons this year with the sort of--"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"With the stuff going on with Trump."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Yeah."
01:21:54;01:21:59;"So should pop music reflect the tumult of the times?"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Well, let's find out. Let's talk about it."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"So first, let's start with 1968."
01:22:04;01:22:09;"The number five song this week in 1968 was by Aretha Franklin, Queen of Soul."
01:22:09;01:22:12;"This song is called ""Sweet, Sweet Baby,"" since you've been gone."

01:22:44;01:22:48;"That Danish guy."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"♪ Seven years ♪"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Oh, yeah, by the way--"
01:22:51;01:22:54;"Well, okay, it's not, but by the way, we've got to talk about something."
01:22:54;01:22:57;"That's a band called Lucas Graham. It's not a guy."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"Some people on Twitter were telling me that."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"So it's like there is no Lucas Graham?"
01:23:01;01:23:07;"No, Lucas Graham is three to seven Danish guys."
01:23:07;01:23:09;"Anyway, that's not her counterpart."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"Okay."
01:23:10;01:23:18;"The counterpart to Aretha Franklin in the number five slot today, in 2016, is Zayn."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Do you remember who Zayn is?"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember now."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"Who's Zayn?"
01:23:22;01:23:25;"The guy that went solo from One Direction."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Okay, nice. All right, I'm impressed."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"And he went real explicit and sexual."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"That's right, with this song, ""Pillow Talk."""
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Growing up."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"He's all grown up."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"I can't remember. Did you like this song last time?"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"It was all right."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"I feel like you always criticize some of the younger pop artists"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"as not having a lot of character in them."
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Yeah."
01:23:42;01:23:43;"This has character."
01:23:43;01:23:46;"Yeah, more so than Lucas."

01:24:08;01:24:12;"What if pop music just keeps going and it's just like-"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"It will, you know?"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"People are doing this show in like a hundred years and they're like,"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"""Let's do the pop charts from like 82 years ago."""
01:24:18;01:24:21;"That'll be interesting when it's like a hundred years."
01:24:21;01:24:24;"Because we couldn't do it like 82 years ago."
01:24:24;01:24:28;"There were charts in the 40s, maybe the 30s, probably the 40s."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"I was thinking about this."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"What are the connections between Aretha Franklin and Zayn?"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"Her song ""Sweet Sweet Baby Since You've Been Gone,"" his song ""Pillow Talk."""
01:24:35;01:24:38;"They're both about the ups and downs of romance."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Yeah."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"That's not going anywhere."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Human nature doesn't change. Technology does."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Human nature does not change, Ezra."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"You know something my cousin said to me when I was in New York?"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Cousin Asher, shout out to you."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"You haven't been on this show in a long time because I've been in LA so much."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"We were having a conversation."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"I don't know if he read this somewhere."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"It was just like a very succinct way of saying something."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"We were talking about music and stuff and like, you know,"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"the way people feel about certain types of music."
01:25:03;01:25:11;"And he said, ""Well, you know, everything's cyclical except technology."""
01:25:11;01:25:13;"And I was like, ""Poof!"""
01:25:13;01:25:14;"That's good. I like that."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"That was deep, Cousin Asher. He's right."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"Things go in and out of style."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Sometimes it's cool to talk about your emotions."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Sometimes it's cool to be a little disaffected."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"That'll always be back and forth."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"But technology is not cyclical."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"No, that's just like--"
01:25:27;01:25:30;"People try to say, ""Oh, kids like record players now. It's cyclical."""
01:25:30;01:25:31;"No, it's not."
01:25:31;01:25:36;"There's no way that my kids are going to be into CDs."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"No."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Maybe as a joke."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"Well, yeah, and vinyl is like a fetishist's antiquated technology."
01:25:42;01:25:47;"Yeah, it's not like there's kids out there who are really into Edison cylinders."
01:25:47;01:25:51;"Right, right. Vinyl is not part of the technological conversation."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"It exists now because it's the opposite of that."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"Right, yeah."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"So your cousin's right, though."
01:25:56;01:26:01;"All of the human nature stuff and art and what's fashionable aesthetically,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"completely cyclical."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Yeah, I'm willing to believe that in 100 years,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"there might be a large group of kids wearing bell bottoms."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"But there'll probably also be holograms."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"And then you'll be a teenager when you're like 50."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"Oh, yeah. Oh, with all the drugs."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Anyway, back to 1968."
01:26:23;01:26:27;"The number four song, four knuckleheads out of Liverpool, you might have heard of,"
01:26:27;01:26:32;"the Beatles, and this was their song ""Lady Madonna."""
01:26:32;01:26:34;"I always thought this was one of the more random Beatles songs."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Yeah, not a good one, really."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"It's not bad."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"It's not bad."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"This is a total Paul song."
01:26:42;01:26:46;"Lady Madonna, children at your feet,"
01:26:46;01:26:51;"wonder how you managed to make ends meet."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"You know what I respect about Paul?"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"What's that?"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"He does voices."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Yeah, I know. That's what I'm thinking right now."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"He's like Eminem."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"This is like Paul doing his weird--"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"I don't know what it is, like American?"
01:27:03;01:27:07;"I think it's like he's pretending to be an old-timey guy."
01:27:07;01:27:12;"Like a piano bar in 19th century San Francisco?"
01:27:12;01:27:15;"Or even in the UK, they had the old British dance hall."
01:27:15;01:27:19;"Madonna, Lady Madonna."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"What is this song about?"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"It's about a--"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"Oh, baby, at your breast."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"It's about a struggling single mom."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"But there's some relation to--"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"To the Madonna."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"That was also a single mom."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I don't know."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Are you single mom if you have--"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Obviously, Joseph was there,"
01:27:38;01:27:41;"Madonna being the Blessed Virgin Mary."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"She was a single mom in the sense that God,"
01:27:43;01:27:47;"who impregnated her, was not exactly in the picture."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"Right."
01:27:48;01:27:52;"But she wasn't single because she had a husband, Joseph."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"Right. Yeah."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Biological dad was not around."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"But she was lucky enough to find--"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"A stepfather."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Yeah, to step in."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"The original, the ultimate cuckold,"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"Joseph."
01:28:07;01:28:10;"Anyway, what's the--"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"So, yeah."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"What's the equivalent?"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"The number--"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"The counterpart of the Beatles, 1968, Lady Madonna."
01:28:16;01:28:18;"Some deep Drake song."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"Good guess, Jake."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"But actually, it's our old friend Meghan Trainor with ""No."""
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Okay."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"I think it's so cute"
01:28:26;01:28:30;"And I think it's so sweet"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"How you let your friends encourage you"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"To try and talk to me"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"But let me say--"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"This also has this old-timey vibe."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"Oh, it's a snake. Yeah, she's in a voice."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Before you speak"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Lady Madonna"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"I tell her, I tell her, no, no, no"
01:28:47;01:28:51;"My name is No, my sign is No, my number is No"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"You need to let it go"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"My name is No"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Hi, my name is--"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Well, you know, this is what the ultimate pop songwriters do"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"is they just take little bits of everything"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"and change it just enough to not get sued."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"That's not--"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"My name is No"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"That is not the mark of good songwriting."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Good songwriting is inspiration."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"It's not collaging your past influences"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"to barely avoid getting sued."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"You know what, man?"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"It's not--"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"You know what, man?"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"I gotta say something."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"I was in the sound"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Last time on the show"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"I was shouting out Meghan Trainor"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"'cause she's from Nantucket."
01:29:27;01:29:30;"I think it's really cool that she's from an island."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Well, I'm from an-- I was born on an island."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Manhattan?"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"Yeah."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Okay."
01:29:36;01:29:37;"So I always feel like a connection"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"to other people who were born on islands."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"That's legit."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"But I was shouting out Meghan Trainor"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"and a lot of people on Twitter were saying"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Meghan Trainor's problematic."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And I was like, well, okay, I wonder--"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"For what reason?"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"The main thing that people--"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"To be honest, guys, full disclosure,"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"I didn't do any real research about"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"why or why not Meghan Trainor's this problematic"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"'cause we're gonna play the song anyway"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"because it is the number four song on iTunes"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"and we have a duty to go through those songs."
01:29:59;01:30:02;"People were claiming that maybe in some of her lyrics"
01:30:02;01:30:05;"in the past or interviews that she had--"
01:30:05;01:30:10;"she is larger than the standard kind of pop star."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"Mm-hmm."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Wait, what do you mean, larger?"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"Physically?"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah."
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Okay, plus size."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Yeah, plus size."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Okay."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"'Cause I have no idea what she looks like."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"Right."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"She's attracted by many people's standards,"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"but she's, you know, bigger than a model."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"The waif-thin standard."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"And so whatever, that's cool, of course,"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"that, you know, she's not conforming"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"to preordained standards, but I guess people felt like"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"sometimes she went a little too far."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"That rather than just saying, like, yeah,"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"this is what I look like and I'm confident,"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"I'm sexy, too, there's a million ways to look sexy,"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"that she'd kind of shame skinny girls somehow."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Hmm."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"That makes me think of Aretha."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"I mean, Aretha, I wonder if Aretha--"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"was that a thing in the '60s?"
01:30:48;01:30:49;"That's a-- I mean--"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Where people were like, ""God, Aretha."
01:30:51;01:30:53;"""She should lose a few."""
01:30:53;01:30:57;"I mean, it's like, I doubt it."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Well, look, there's always been--"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"Okay, shaming skinny girls, that's hilarious."
01:31:01;01:31:02;"Well, what do you mean?"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"I mean, look, no, here's the thing."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"That's hilarious."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Well, look, there are lots of natural different body types."
01:31:06;01:31:07;"Absolutely."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"So I guess people felt like maybe if Meghan Trainor"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"said something along the lines of, like,"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"""You know what? I'm proud to look the way I look."""
01:31:14;01:31:16;"People were like, ""Yeah, I'm with you."""
01:31:16;01:31:18;"And she's like, ""Because I don't want to look like"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"""one of these disgusting, skeletal, skinny girls"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"""who make me literally want to puke."""
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Although I don't know if she said that."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"You know what? I don't want to talk about this anymore"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"because we didn't do enough research."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Number three song of 1968."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"Oh, I know you know this one because I've heard you sing it"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"at karaoke, I think."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"Okay."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"""Gary Puckett and the Union Gap."""

01:34:35;01:34:37;"Don't throw Paul under the bus."

01:34:38;01:34:40;"Lady Madonna is not a strong Beatles song,"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"but Paul has written many great songs."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"I always considered myself more of a John guy,"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"but as the years go on, sometimes I flip-flop."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"Yeah."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"I mean, if I had to choose, I'd go John,"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"but Paul's, you know, so many incredible songs."
01:34:54;01:34:55;"Yeah."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"The melodies are insane."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"But I also thought in the later years of the Beatles"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"that they were, like, basically four solo artists"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"that hardly interacted at all."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"So it's hard to-- 'cause, like, in their early days,"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"they co-wrote songs."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Oh, yeah."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" that kind of stuff."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Right."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"But then later, it was like--"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Paul was, like, playing drums on stuff, like, by himself."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"Yeah."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"So the number two song in 1968 is ""By the Box Tops."""
01:35:17;01:35:18;"I know them."
01:35:19;01:35:19;"They did that song, ""The Letter."""
01:35:19;01:35:21;"It was Alex Chilton's band when he was, like, a teenager."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"Alex Chilton went on to have-- be a big star"
01:35:24;01:35:25;"and have a cool solo career."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"So this is ""The Box Tops"" with ""Cry Like a Baby."""
01:35:27;01:35:28;"I don't know if I know it."
01:35:31;01:35:32;"Cool organ."
01:35:35;01:35:39;"(SINGING) When I think about the good love you gave me,"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"I cry like a baby."
01:35:42;01:35:46;"Living without you is driving me crazy."
01:35:46;01:35:47;"So this is 1968."
01:35:48;01:35:48;"That's what's interesting."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"But the '68--"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"It doesn't sound, like, older."
01:35:50;01:35:53;"This top five is, like, super square."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"Yeah."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"A lot of the stuff that was more out there"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"was obviously not top five."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Yeah, like, what else?"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"The Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"CSNY."
01:36:02;01:36:03;"They were out in '68?"
01:36:03;01:36:04;"Yeah."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"I don't really have anything to say about this."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"It's OK. It's good."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"It's an oldie."
01:36:08;01:36:12;"The number two song in 2016 is ""Designer."""
01:36:12;01:36:13;"You know who that is?"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"No."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"He's a rapper out of Brooklyn."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"This song was kind of--"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"I don't know how to describe it--"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"semi-used on the new Kanye record."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"People compare him to Future."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"And there's a big hit called ""Panda."""
01:36:26;01:36:27;"Great song."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"(SINGING) You are now listening to the hottest producer"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"with the hottest beats."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"Falling in."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"So you're hearing this for the first time, Jake?"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Yeah, I've never heard this."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Like it so far?"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I-- no."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"[laughter]"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"I mean, it just sounds like everything else."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"OK."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"British? Wait."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"No, no, no."
01:37:02;01:37:03;"""Panda."" He's from Brooklyn."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"He sounds like-- he said--"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"he said Brooklyn."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"But it sounds-- doesn't it sound kind of--"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"He's doing a little bit of a voice, maybe."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"Do you know who Future is?"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"No."
01:37:15;01:37:15;"You don't know who Future is?"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"No."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"Have you ever heard of a guy called Future?"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"No."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"For the third time."
01:37:22;01:37:23;"No idea?"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"No, I've never heard of Future."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"OK."
01:37:26;01:37:29;"So the fact that people say designer sounds like Future--"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"I'm speaking--"
01:37:30;01:37:31;"No."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"I'm speaking--"

01:38:40;01:38:43;"But friend, it hasn't been too long."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"It wasn't big."

01:39:25;01:39:27;"He's got to be talking about his girlfriend here."
01:39:27;01:39:30;"And I surprised her with a puppy."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"God, the '60s really were a nightmare."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"Who was buying records in 1968 that made this the number one"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"single?"
01:39:36;01:39:40;"Because it's hard to picture 17-year-old kids going"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"to bat for this."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Silent Majority was buying it, man."
01:39:43;01:39:44;"Nixon won."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"That's right, the Silent Majority, yeah."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"That's who was buying."
01:39:46;01:39:49;"OK, this is going to be a really interesting comparison."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"So that was the number one song in 1968."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Very uncool."
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Deeply uncool."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"And I don't think country's uncool."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"I love country."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"Between the Bobby Goldsboro and the Gary Puckett,"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"this has just been so square."
01:40:00;01:40:04;"And even the Beatles, supposedly one of the greatest"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"bands of all time, and all they had in the top five"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"was ""Lady Madonna,"" not a very good song."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"And I like the Beatles, so I don't want to--"

01:40:13;01:40:14;"Yeah, I don't want any of that."

01:40:35;01:40:37;"You see me, do me, da, da, da, da, da, da."
01:40:37;01:40:40;"That's how my body work, work, work, work, work, work."

01:40:50;01:40:52;"""Work"" means a lot of things."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"It's interesting."
01:40:53;01:40:57;"It's a really interesting word to make your chorus."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"One thing that a lot of people said about this song"
01:40:59;01:41:03;"is that it's one of the big Rihanna singles that's"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"the most difficult to understand."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"And it's not because of her accent, necessarily,"
01:41:07;01:41:11;"because Rihanna has sung many songs that it's a little easier"
01:41:11;01:41:12;"for people to understand."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"But it's cool."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"It's like a more laid back delivery."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"(SINGING) Something that I never had."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"Something that you never seen."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Something that you never been."
01:41:22;01:41:26;"Mm, but I wake up in LA now."
01:41:26;01:41:31;"The lyrics are saying, he said me have to work, work, work,"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"work, work."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"He see me do me dirt, dirt, dirt."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"I think it's talking about a relationship."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"And you know what's interesting?"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"There's another hit song right now."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"I guess not in the top five, that's also the chorus."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"It's basically work, work, work."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"But it's about how you can work from--"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"you don't got to go to work."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"It's by Fifth Harmony."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"So work is big in the atmosphere."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"So I guess we can make a case that everybody's"
01:41:52;01:41:56;"singing about work because it's an election year."
01:41:56;01:41:59;"And we're grappling with how hard Americans have to work just"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"to keep their head above water."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"Right, yeah, that's the classic narrative,"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"is that Americans are working more and more and more"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"and more every year."
01:42:07;01:42:11;"And that's-- so work is basically a repeated word"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"in two big hit songs right now."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Yeah, when I heard that Rihanna song, I was like,"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"that's a dope and dark chorus."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I didn't really-- and I didn't really even care to--"
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Right."
01:42:21;01:42:23;"Well, because even if the song is about a relationship,"
01:42:23;01:42:27;"it still is disseminating this word work over and over again."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"It's heavy."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"So can you also imagine-- and also, the song is dark."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"It's got a somber tone."
01:42:31;01:42:35;"It's not happy exactly, just musically."
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Yeah, so just imagine how many people are just literally--"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Oh my god."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"--just at work."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"You're just at an Office Depot, stocking the shelves."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"I know, yeah, this is no diss on Rihanna."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"Work, work, work, work, work."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Yeah, but it's like--"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"yeah, that's weirdly dystopian."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Imagine-- and I love this song."
01:42:52;01:42:56;"And I'm not trying to say that Rihanna is in any way"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"trying to contribute to a dystopian,"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"late capitalist nightmare."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"But yeah, again, I love this image."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"You're just somebody at work, working"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"for a giant corporation."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Right."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"And you're just there."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"And they're like, hey, guys, we're"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"going to pump in some tunes."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"You want to listen to the radio?"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Oh, yeah, sure, put on the Top 40 station."
01:43:14;01:43:15;"I like music."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"And then you're just there, stocking the shelves."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"And then you just hear--"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Work, work, work, work, work."
01:43:19;01:43:23;"You got those inventory forms?"
01:43:23;01:43:26;"Bring the pallet jacker, I'm back."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Oh, god."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Man, OK, so basically, no question--"
01:43:29;01:43:30;"You know what?"
01:43:30;01:43:33;"So she's unintentionally-- we assume,"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"because this song's about a relationship."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"It's not about-- it's not a critique"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"of late period capitalism."
01:43:37;01:43:42;"So she's unintentionally creating this weird critique"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"that's happening in the environment people"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"are working in."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"And then it's weird to think about a band like Radiohead"
01:43:47;01:43:50;"or something that would very deliberately try"
01:43:50;01:43:54;"to make a concept album about late period capitalism"
01:43:54;01:43:57;"and people being overworked, but how their music wouldn't"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"be in that environment."
01:43:58;01:44:00;"Yeah, talk about working too hard."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Yeah."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"No disrespect to Radiohead."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"No, well, first of all, I don't think"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"you can take away the intentionality from Rihanna."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Isn't that the ultimate genius?"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Is that--"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Absolutely."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Is that you write a song that's not on its surface about--"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"you're saying, oh, I'm just talking about the work that"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"goes into a relationship."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"He told me I have to work."
01:44:16;01:44:19;"But then ultimately, it's a stealth move."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"It's so much better."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"No, I'm saying Rihanna's better than Radiohead."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"That's what I'm saying."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"OK."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"It's more open to interpretation."
01:44:26;01:44:29;"It's not so overdetermined and like, this is what we mean."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"We are critiquing computers and technology"
01:44:32;01:44:35;"and the alienation of society."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Yeah, you know what's funny?"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"It's not crazy to imagine Tom York on this."
01:44:38;01:44:43;"Imagine-- this also shows how cool pop music's become"
01:44:43;01:44:46;"in the sense that pop music and quote unquote"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"experimental weird music used to be a million miles apart."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"This has been talked about at length."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Whereas now pop music takes what it wants"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"and does everything with it."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"So like a sound that maybe in the past people"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"would have been like, oh, that's like some weird Radiohead"
01:44:57;01:45:00;"sound, Rihanna can use it."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"But in an interesting way."
01:45:01;01:45:04;"So it's like, imagine like 2000 Radiohead put out a song"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"and started like this."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"You'd be like, yep, makes sense."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Totally."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"[singing]"
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Yeah."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"[singing]"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Maybe not quite."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"The first song-- this is almost like a weird variation"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"on the first song of Kid A."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"[singing]"
01:45:20;01:45:21;"In its right place."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"And that's kind of like, yeah, like dude stocking shelves"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"at the office depot."
01:45:25;01:45:26;"Oh my god."
01:45:26;01:45:30;"We need to make like a dystopian just like stocking shelves"
01:45:30;01:45:33;"mix that's just like work by Rihanna, everything"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"in its right place."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Just on loop, those two songs."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"Well, anyway, that's the top five."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"1968 versus 2016."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"Who wins?"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"I got to go with 2016."
01:45:43;01:45:47;"Not that I like any of the music except the Rihanna song."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"But '68 was so weak."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"It's terrible."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"Remember when we were growing up and everybody's always"
01:45:52;01:45:55;"saying like, oh man, the '60s were so cool?"
01:45:55;01:45:56;"Yeah, people still say that."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"I don't think they say that anymore."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"Really?"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"I think people might be like, oh, there"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"was cool stuff from the '60s."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"But nobody's ever like the '60s were cool."
01:46:04;01:46:08;"The people were like, the '60s was a crazy, messed up time"
01:46:08;01:46:09;"in American history."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"And some good things started then."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"But nobody wants to go back to the '60s."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Well, I don't know."
01:46:15;01:46:18;"I still see it as like a high watermark culturally"
01:46:18;01:46:21;"for the West."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Not based on the top songs."
01:46:23;01:46:27;"We caught a real lemon of a week."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Well, that's also important to remember."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"Oh, 1968 was like this big year."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Everything was shifting in culture."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"People were like challenging norms."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"And what were they listening to?"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Was it Lady Madonna?"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"It's amazing how square the top five was."
01:46:38;01:46:41;"Yeah, so to me, I think 2016 mops the floor."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"I agree."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"And there you have it."

01:52:46;01:52:48;"Made it through another episode"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"Season 2's going pretty good so far"
01:52:49;01:52:50;"Mm-hmm"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Time crisis"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"We had a lot of good people come through"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"Back in New York last week"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Thank you to Zachary Lopez"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Formerly an enemy"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Now not an enemy"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"A colleague"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"Now a colleague"
01:53:04;01:53:05;"We had some good conversation"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Thanks to Rashida Jones"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Makonnen, aka Isle of Makonnen"
01:53:09;01:53:12;"And Dave1 from Chromio for sharing their Prince stories"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Those are good stories"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"You know, obviously it's super sad when somebody dies and"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"57 is definitely too young"
01:53:19;01:53:19;"Super young"
01:53:19;01:53:22;"It's too young, especially for somebody with the- who's so prolific"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"But it's interesting to see like for different people"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Exactly what he meant to them"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"'Cause he means different things to everybody"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"You know one thing I was thinking about recently"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Or Rashida told me this"
01:53:32;01:53:36;"Is that I guess Michael, Prince, and Madonna were all born the same year"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"Wow"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"Three of these superstars like"
01:53:39;01:53:39;"That's crazy"
01:53:39;01:53:40;"Totally changing culture"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"And now only Madonna's left"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Wow"
01:53:44;01:53:44;"That's heavy"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"But it kind of makes you think-"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"I was actually talking about this"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"'Cause you know earlier we were talking about how my grandfather died"
01:53:48;01:53:51;"So essentially I have no grandparents left"
01:53:51;01:53:55;"I have one grandmother who's kind of like institutionalized"
01:53:55;01:53:55;"Wow"
01:53:55;01:53:59;"Yeah, she's been living in a hospital room in the Bronx for like the past few years"
01:53:59;01:54:02;"And I was talking with a friend about like"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Yeah, what does it mean we don't have any grandparents left?"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"'Cause like if your grandparents made it to an old age"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"It's not too brutal"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Like they lived a good long life"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"You can't call it tragic exactly"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"So what does it mean when like your grandparents left?"
01:54:14;01:54:17;"And it kind of just means that like the generations have shifted"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"It means these people that were always there"
01:54:19;01:54:22;"Kind of holding it down on the outer end of the spectrum"
01:54:22;01:54:23;"They're gone"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"It means your parents are moving up"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"To that next range of age"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"And it means you're moving up"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"And suddenly it's like you could kind of count on"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Well there's two generations above me"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Now there's one generation above you"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"So there'll be no generations above you"
01:54:38;01:54:38;"Yeah"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"That means you're next"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"It means the way you think about culture changes"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"The way you think about time changes"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"So in a way like these legends passing away"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"It's like it feels kind of crazy"
01:54:46;01:54:49;"That's like Bowie and Prince in the same year"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"That's just the way of the world man"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"That whole dang human comedy"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Yeah, I mean who's the next generation after Prince, Michael, Madonna?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Who's like the next generation of superstars?"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Like Drake?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Timberlake?"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"Well yeah sure"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"No no I'm just imagining like hopefully"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"We're all pretty fairly close in age"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Is Justin Timberlake, he's younger than me"
01:55:08;01:55:09;"Yeah probably"
01:55:09;01:55:09;"He's 39"
01:55:09;01:55:10;"Yeah he's probably like mid-30s"
01:55:10;01:55:14;"So but let's say Justin Timberlake dies when Prince dies"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"Yeah"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"I really gotta make clear"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"I'm not wishing an early death on Justin Timberlake"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"I'm really just trying to think like actually"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"In a deep emotional way about what this stuff means"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Yeah"
01:55:23;01:55:24;"So think about that"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"You'll be 62"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"So you'll be like kind of like an old dude"
01:55:27;01:55:30;"And you'll like be checking Twitter or whatever exists"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"The version of Twitter that exists then"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Just be like Timberlake's dead"
01:55:33;01:55:36;"However you feel about him it's like"
01:55:36;01:55:36;"Yeah"
01:55:36;01:55:39;"It's such a deep symbol of time passing"
01:55:39;01:55:43;"Anyway we'll be back in two weeks with more Time Crisis"
01:55:43;01:55:47;"Truly shout out to Prince like absolute musical legend"
01:55:47;01:55:50;"Thank God we have your incredible body of work"
01:55:50;01:55:53;"39 studio albums"
01:55:53;01:55:53;"That's incredible"
01:55:53;01:55:57;"Amazing and written so many hits for other people that we can spend time with"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"And thanks for listening to Time Crisis"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"Thank you for being here with me Jake"
01:56:01;01:56:02;"We'll see you guys in two weeks"
01:56:03;01:56:08;"I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant"
01:56:08;01:56:18;"But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues"
01:56:18;01:56:31;"'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you"
01:56:31;01:56:41;"It's been so lonely without you here"
01:56:41;01:56:46;"Like a bird without its song"
01:56:47;01:56:52;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
01:56:52;01:56:56;"Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling"
01:56:56;01:57:04;"Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
01:57:04;01:57:13;"I can put my arm around every boy I see"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"But only when we feel"
01:57:18;01:57:30;"I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me"
01:57:30;01:57:36;"He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"""
01:57:36;01:57:45;"But he's a fool 'cause nothing compares, nothing compares"
01:57:46;01:57:49;"to you"
