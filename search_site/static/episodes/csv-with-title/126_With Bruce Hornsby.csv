00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis back once again. It's summertime. So in this episode we will change our formula slightly"
00:09;00:18;"to give you a summertime edition of Time Crisis. We will be joined by the absolute legend Bruce"
00:18;00:28;"Hornsby to talk his new album The Grateful Dead and of course The Range. This is Time Crisis"
00:28;00:30;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:32;"Let's begin."
00:38;00:43;"Passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"You were a felt rubbing me of my rightful chances"
00:50;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:04;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"In a lonely bay"
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis back again, what's up Jake?"
01:22;01:23;"Not much, how are you?"
01:23;01:26;"I'm alright, what'd you do during your bye week?"
01:26;01:31;"Let's see, that's last week, things have been a little slow"
01:31;01:33;"Well you've completed your Chuck E. Cheese painting"
01:33;01:36;"That's right, that was last week, that was a big moment"
01:36;01:39;"For anybody who hasn't seen, Jake, I think you posted on Instagram"
01:39;01:42;"But you just finished this great Chuck E. Cheese painting"
01:42;01:44;"We've been talking about Chuck E. Cheese recently"
01:44;01:46;"I think even since the last episode they went bankrupt"
01:46;01:48;"So they've really been in the news lately"
01:48;01:51;"You've been wanting to paint a Chuck E. Cheese for a couple years?"
01:51;01:55;"I don't think that long, I mean I've just been dealing with that subject matter for many years"
01:55;01:58;"But specifically Chuck E., I was like, in the last six months"
01:58;02:02;"I just had kind of a hankering for a Chuck E. Cheese painting"
02:02;02:04;"I mean, your timing couldn't be better though"
02:04;02:10;"Yeah, then I worked up a good image that I thought would work at a large scale for a painting"
02:10;02:14;"And started it like three or four weeks ago"
02:14;02:19;"Right around the time that I think we did the Chuck E. Cheese history episode"
02:19;02:19;"Yeah"
02:19;02:24;"And then the news dropped last week and then my social media was blowing up with TC heads being like"
02:24;02:29;"""Dude, Chuck E.'s going out"" and then I dropped the bomb of this brand new painting"
02:29;02:32;"So, is Chuck E. Cheese really going out?"
02:32;02:35;"I've always been confused about that because like, declaring bankruptcy"
02:35;02:37;"That's kind of like an accounting maneuver"
02:37;02:39;"Right"
02:39;02:40;"I don't totally understand"
02:40;02:44;"I feel like I've heard that Sears is like going out of business for the last like 20 years"
02:44;02:49;"But we just bought a dishwasher from Sears yesterday"
02:49;02:50;"Really?"
02:50;02:54;"And there's going to be a Sears technician that comes to the house and installs it"
02:54;02:55;"Interesting"
02:55;03:00;"I wonder if he's going to be wearing a Sears uniform or if he's some kind of third party hired gun"
03:00;03:01;"This came up"
03:01;03:05;"He's going to be wearing a Sears uniform because the plumber was over yesterday"
03:05;03:06;"Here we go"
03:06;03:10;"Boring domestic quarantine stories"
03:10;03:12;"The plumber was over yesterday and he was like"
03:12;03:16;"""Look, you could buy the dishwasher from like Best Buy or Home Depot"""
03:16;03:19;"""But they're going to farm out installation"""
03:19;03:22;"""And if there's a problem, then it's like, 'Oh, who's left holding the bag?'"""
03:22;03:25;"So he's like, ""Get a dishwasher from Sears"""
03:25;03:28;"""So if there's a problem with the dishwasher, if they're missing a part, whatever"""
03:28;03:32;"""The Sears guy, it's all one company that's handling the sale of the product"""
03:32;03:33;"""And the installation of the product"""
03:33;03:35;"More accountability"
03:35;03:38;"This is weirdly related to Chuck E. Cheese"
03:38;03:42;"The reason we had to get a new dishwasher is that this is nasty"
03:42;03:44;"Our last dishwasher started leaking"
03:44;03:46;"Wait, I got a guess, Nat"
03:46;03:50;"Wait, I guess it either has something to do with rats or pizza"
03:50;03:51;"You're right"
03:51;03:53;"It has to do with the first, rats"
03:53;03:56;"You got a rat's nest in your dishwasher?"
03:56;03:58;"Well, under the dishwasher"
03:58;04:00;"The dishwasher started leaking"
04:00;04:05;"I removed that little plastic skirt at the bottom of the dishwasher"
04:05;04:08;"And looked under, and there was a rat's nest"
04:08;04:09;"It was so nasty, dude"
04:09;04:14;"It was like, they dragged in sticks and just random garbage"
04:14;04:19;"And they just burrowed through the wall and back of the dishwasher"
04:19;04:21;"And they chewed through all the piping"
04:21;04:22;"Oh god"
04:22;04:23;"So rats actually build a nest?"
04:23;04:25;"I guess so"
04:25;04:29;"They chew through all the plastic tubes where all the water runs through"
04:29;04:31;"So that was causing the leak"
04:31;04:35;"I read an article when quarantine first started"
04:35;04:40;"That was about mechanics getting a lot of people coming in with car trouble"
04:40;04:42;"That he determined was caused by rats"
04:42;04:44;"Because people's cars are sitting around more"
04:44;04:48;"And it's similar, in the article they described that rats chew through wires"
04:48;04:50;"Because it's kind of what they're programmed to do"
04:50;04:53;"In nature, they would chew on vines and stuff"
04:53;04:56;"Because their teeth grow so fast and so sharp"
04:56;04:58;"That if they're not constantly gnawing"
04:58;05:01;"Their teeth would actually grow into their jaw"
05:01;05:03;"And like, yeah, it would mess them up"
05:03;05:06;"So basically their teeth grow way faster and sharper than a human's"
05:06;05:08;"They need to always be gnawing"
05:08;05:12;"So in an urban environment where they're not finding all the usual things to gnaw on"
05:12;05:14;"They're always looking for wires"
05:14;05:18;"And there's sometimes even certain things used in the casing of wires"
05:18;05:22;"That they find kind of like, tasty or attractive"
05:22;05:25;"So anyway, a lot of people rolling up with rat nests in their engines"
05:25;05:27;"I've wondered about that"
05:27;05:33;"Because sometimes I get in my car and it like, inexplicably smells like s***"
05:33;05:34;"Like animal s***"
05:34;05:35;"Like cat s***"
05:35;05:38;"Because I park in this alley under this tree usually"
05:38;05:41;"And you also, as we've discussed, you have a big minivan"
05:41;05:43;"With only two seats up front"
05:43;05:45;"So there's a lot of room to party in"
05:45;05:48;"Oh my god, can you imagine like some insane horror movie?"
05:48;05:50;"You come out to your car at like three in the morning"
05:50;05:53;"And there's just like 800 rats just like..."
05:53;05:54;"Just swarm you while you're driving"
05:54;05:55;"A rat king"
05:55;05:57;"A rat king? I was actually thinking about that"
05:57;06:00;"Are you familiar with the concept of a rat king, Jake?"
06:00;06:01;"Deeply"
06:01;06:04;"So a rat king is just when a ton of rats get their tails"
06:04;06:08;"Irreversibly tied together in kind of a circular formation"
06:08;06:08;"Yeah"
06:08;06:14;"Oftentimes it's gum that adheres the tails together or sap"
06:14;06:14;"Gum?"
06:14;06:15;"Yeah"
06:15;06:18;"You wouldn't think gum would have the power to do that"
06:18;06:20;"This is an awful conversation"
06:20;06:22;"Yeah, truly terrifying"
06:22;06:24;"Just the plumber rolling up just like"
06:24;06:27;"""All right, you got a rat king under the dishwasher"""
06:27;06:29;"""It's gonna cost you"""
06:29;06:33;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:33;06:36;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:36;06:46;"All you little kids seem to think it knows where it's at"
06:46;06:48;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:48;06:59;"Walking down the street, carryin' my face to the back"
06:59;07:01;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
07:01;07:02;"All right, well that's gonna be cool"
07:02;07:06;"You can get to check out a uniformed Sears officer"
07:06;07:10;"Yeah, maybe I can ask them about the status of the company"
07:10;07:13;"I thought you guys declared bankruptcy like three or four times"
07:13;07:14;"What's going on?"
07:14;07:17;"I feel like Sears has gone bankrupt every other year"
07:17;07:18;"like since I've been 10"
07:18;07:20;"Yes"
07:20;07:23;"What are companies that straight up vanished off the face of the earth?"
07:23;07:24;"Like are done done?"
07:24;07:26;"Pan Am went fully out of business"
07:26;07:27;"That must have been pretty wild"
07:27;07:30;"You had the giant building in New York was the Pan Am building"
07:30;07:33;"So that must have really felt like the end of an era"
07:33;07:34;"Blockbuster Video"
07:34;07:37;"Does Blockbuster Video in any way still exist?"
07:37;07:40;"There's like one in like Bend, Oregon"
07:40;07:43;"But like as a corporation, it is not a thing"
07:44;07:48;"They were defunct as of January 12, 2014"
07:48;07:50;"The Bend, Oregon, you're right, absolutely"
07:50;07:51;"That's the final one"
07:51;07:55;"And I guess before that, there were a few left in Western Australia"
07:55;07:56;"But they all closed last year"
07:56;08:00;"Western? That is so deep"
08:00;08:02;"Western Australia is very deep, you know"
08:02;08:06;"Like we've been there a lot over the years playing shows in Perth"
08:06;08:08;"It's a cool city"
08:08;08:11;"You don't definitely don't feel like you're in the middle of nowhere or anything"
08:11;08:12;"But the thing people always say"
08:12;08:14;"I don't know exactly what the language is"
08:14;08:21;"Is that Perth is like the largest metropolitan area that's the most isolated"
08:21;08:27;"Just because the next metropolitan area that's like the same size of it is so far away"
08:27;08:29;"You know, Australia is like roughly the same size as the US"
08:29;08:32;"In terms of ge- wow, yeah, that's crazy"
08:32;08:33;"In terms of geography"
08:33;08:35;"It is kind of the same way I feel about Pennsylvania"
08:35;08:37;"I always forget how wide it is"
08:37;08:40;"So you're like getting on the flight from like Sydney to Perth"
08:40;08:41;"And you're just like, wait, how long is this flight again?"
08:41;08:44;"You're just like, oh my god, it's like flying from New York to LA"
08:44;08:48;"But I think the geography of Australia, maybe an Australian could correct me"
08:48;08:51;"But it's almost as if the US was like LA"
08:51;08:58;"And then all the other big cities of the country were just like New York, Atlanta and like New Orleans"
08:58;08:59;"Right"
08:59;09:03;"So I can imagine outside of Perth in this big state of Western Australia"
09:03;09:11;"There probably were tiny little like towns where people still really relied on their blockbusters"
09:11;09:15;"I was thinking about DVDs yesterday because I was in a Best Buy"
09:15;09:16;"I was checking out dishwashers"
09:16;09:18;"This is before we decided to go with Sears"
09:18;09:27;"They were just like selling Rambo 2 and Rambo 3 on DVD for like $14.99"
09:27;09:30;"Yes, they're selling like full price Rambo DVDs"
09:30;09:32;"And they had like multiple copies"
09:32;09:34;"I've been working on a song"
09:34;09:39;"Well, I've been messing around with a song for a few years that's called DVD Store"
09:39;09:39;"Oh"
09:39;09:40;"That's all I'll say about it"
09:40;09:41;"Okay"
09:41;09:44;"Maybe it'll be on the next album, maybe on something else"
09:44;09:51;"But I've also found that a very evocative phrase, DVD Store"
09:51;09:57;"Yo, I wanted to watch the film Inland Empire by David Lynch a couple weeks ago"
09:57;09:58;"Oh yeah"
09:58;10:01;"And I learned that it is only available on DVD"
10:01;10:03;"You can't stream it, you have to buy it"
10:03;10:04;"For whatever reason"
10:04;10:07;"Well, David Lynch famously will not let his movies be streamed"
10:07;10:08;"And"
10:08;10:10;"That's not true"
10:10;10:12;"No, most of his"
10:12;10:15;"All the ones that he can, that he has control over"
10:15;10:15;"Maybe"
10:15;10:16;"Does not want to stream"
10:16;10:21;"And if you buy the DVD, in my experience, or watch the DVD of all movies"
10:21;10:25;"Certainly Mulholland Drive and the other ones I can remember"
10:25;10:28;"He won't put in chapters, so you have to watch the whole movie"
10:28;10:30;"Oh"
10:30;10:34;"Because he doesn't like people skipping around it, it's wild"
10:34;10:34;"Interesting"
10:34;10:36;"That might be the only movie he controls"
10:36;10:40;"Because I feel like a lot of them were on Criterion's channel"
10:40;10:42;"So wait, did you buy a Seinfeld?"
10:42;10:44;"No, because I don't even own a DVD player anymore"
10:44;10:48;"So I had this whole debate over, like, do I buy a DVD player"
10:48;10:51;"Just to see this one film that I just wanted to watch right now"
10:51;10:52;"And the answer is no"
10:52;10:54;"I'm going to do a number crunch for you right now"
10:54;10:56;"I'm going on eBay"
10:56;10:59;"And I'm going to see what the cheapest DVD player I can find is"
10:59;11:02;"I guess it's the starting bid"
11:02;11:05;"But it says Free Local Pickup in Crystal Lake, Illinois"
11:06;11:07;"It's a DVD VHS combo"
11:07;11:11;"Starting bid $5, there's nobody's bidding on it"
11:11;11:12;"So I bet you could actually get it for $5"
11:12;11:17;"I'm seeing some other ones that are like, buy it now for $30"
11:17;11:18;"A little steep"
11:18;11:23;"I don't want the hardware in my house, though, just to watch a single film"
11:23;11:26;"Buy the DVD, buy the DVD player, watch it, and then throw them both away"
11:26;11:29;"That's, no"
11:29;11:32;"If I give you the DVD player for $5"
11:32;11:34;"And the DVD, what's that running?"
11:34;11:36;"Like $15, $20?"
11:36;11:40;"But guys, now I have to, like, get it in the mail, like, open the box"
11:40;11:46;"You know, before COVID, you would sometimes go see, you know, Avengers Flavor Blasted 4D"
11:46;11:49;"You know, the ticket could easily have been $19"
11:49;11:51;"Plus parking and all this stuff"
11:51;11:53;"Even just for a solo viewing"
11:53;11:57;"It could easily cost $40 to go see the Avengers"
11:57;11:59;"So you would pay $40 to go see the Avengers"
11:59;12:02;"But not $20 to support local business"
12:02;12:03;"It's an experience"
12:03;12:05;"That's, you know, that's contactless"
12:05;12:10;"As soon as I walk out of the theater, I'm not saddled with the machinery of the film"
12:10;12:11;"I'm not finding much"
12:11;12:15;"But I feel like there must be somebody on eBay who's just like, okay, this is what I'm looking for"
12:15;12:19;"Just selling, like, a ton of DVDs"
12:19;12:22;"Seinfeld, I have a Blu-ray player you could borrow"
12:22;12:24;"So I drive to your place"
12:24;12:26;"I borrow a DVD"
12:26;12:29;"I then order the film from wherever"
12:29;12:30;"It's a lot of work"
12:30;12:32;"It's a lot of legwork"
12:32;12:34;"You know what this makes me think of with David Lynch"
12:34;12:37;"Trying to prohibit his movies from streaming is"
12:37;12:39;"Garth Brooks"
12:39;12:43;"Garth Brooks does not have his music on streaming services"
12:43;12:45;"He's like one of the last big holdouts"
12:45;12:48;"Did you guys watch that doc?"
12:48;12:50;"No, you were saying that that's good"
12:50;12:51;"I gotta check that out"
12:51;12:52;"Amazing"
12:52;12:54;"Wow, he's something else"
12:54;12:58;"I've been fascinated by him when I've seen his little videos here and there"
12:58;12:59;"His little social media posts"
12:59;13:02;"He seems like a very intense guy"
13:02;13:04;"How familiar are you with his music, Jake?"
13:04;13:08;"It was interesting to watch this doc because I was sort of like, well, I know Friends of Low Places"
13:08;13:11;"And after that, I couldn't think of a single song"
13:11;13:14;"And I was like, well, maybe there'll be some others that I recognize"
13:14;13:15;"And there weren't"
13:15;13:17;"You know one Garth Brooks song"
13:17;13:19;"But he's like the biggest selling artist"
13:19;13:21;"Wait, what was it?"
13:21;13:24;"There was some screenshot I took of it that blew my mind"
13:24;13:25;"It was like"
13:25;13:29;"The biggest selling solo male artist in US history"
13:29;13:30;"Some book cooking happening"
13:30;13:33;"But yeah, it was something like the biggest selling solo artist"
13:33;13:35;"Like more than Michael Jackson"
13:35;13:36;"More than Elvis"
13:36;13:37;"More than Springsteen"
13:37;13:38;"Oh my god, yeah"
13:38;13:40;"Garth Brooks just crushes Bruce"
13:40;13:43;"It was like over 100 million records or something"
13:43;13:45;"Yeah, I know he's massive"
13:45;13:46;"It feels like not that long ago"
13:46;13:48;"It could have been 10-15 years ago"
13:48;13:51;"But I'm pretty sure he like sold out Yankee Stadium"
13:51;13:54;"Dude, he played to a million people in Central Park"
13:54;13:55;"Garth did"
13:55;13:58;"Yes, Yankee Stadium is only like 50,000 people"
13:58;14:01;"There was like a free show in Central Park in '97"
14:01;14:02;"This is in the doc"
14:02;14:05;"And they were doing this whole thing"
14:05;14:06;"He was like in his trailer and he's all nervous"
14:06;14:08;"He's like, I don't know man, it's New York"
14:08;14:10;"Oh, he's fancy New Yorkers"
14:10;14:12;"Is anyone gonna be there to come to check me out?"
14:12;14:14;"Little old me"
14:14;14:16;"And then he's like, I open the trailer door"
14:16;14:17;"And I hear the roar of the crowd"
14:17;14:20;"They're here for me"
14:20;14:22;"And then like it was like"
14:22;14:24;"Wait, no Garth, there's 200,000 people here"
14:24;14:27;"Oh no Garth, there's 300,000"
14:28;14:29;"There's 400,000"
14:29;14:31;"Garth, there are 600,000 people"
14:31;14:32;"Like he's just doing this kind of thing"
14:32;14:35;"He's such a ham"
14:35;14:37;"He kind of gives me like L. Ron Hubbard vibes a little bit"
14:37;14:41;"Garth Brooks has sold the most albums in the world"
14:41;14:42;"Of anybody?"
14:42;14:42;"Of anybody"
14:42;14:46;"He's the highest selling recording artist of all time"
14:46;14:48;"It's like peak CD sale"
14:48;14:49;"Like what do they say?"
14:49;14:52;"Like '98 or '99 was the peak of the record industry"
14:52;14:55;"1999, that was the peak"
14:55;14:56;"The close of the 20th century"
14:56;14:58;"It's like perfect"
14:58;15:00;"My familiarity with Garth Brooks' really intense demeanor"
15:00;15:03;"Comes from this video that a friend showed me"
15:03;15:05;"This is probably four or five years ago"
15:05;15:07;"It's kind of like germane to what we're talking about"
15:07;15:10;"Because it's also Garth Brooks like"
15:10;15:13;"Hesitantly stepping into a new arena"
15:13;15:14;"Right"
15:14;15:17;"And this is him posting his first video to Facebook"
15:17;15:20;"Probably when he first launched an official page"
15:20;15:22;"After not being part of it for, you know"
15:22;15:24;"The early rise of social media"
15:24;15:27;"So let's listen to this because this is a very classic video"
15:27;15:28;"Well, I guess it's official"
15:28;15:30;"We're now on Facebook"
15:30;15:33;"I really wasn't sure about this at the start"
15:33;15:36;"But then a friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense"
15:36;15:38;"She said, think of it more as a conversation"
15:38;15:40;"I like that"
15:40;15:43;"But I'm already finding out on my own"
15:43;15:46;"So it's wiping the walls out between you and me"
15:46;15:47;"And I really like that"
15:47;15:48;"I really like that"
15:48;15:49;"It allows us into each other's worlds"
15:49;15:53;"Or I guess in my case, hotel room"
15:54;15:56;"When I think about things I want to post"
15:56;15:59;"I want to post cool stuff, slick stuff, neat stuff"
15:59;16:03;"But most of the stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw stuff like this"
16:03;16:04;"Super raw"
16:04;16:06;"This is just who I am"
16:06;16:07;"Raw indeed"
16:07;16:09;"So if this is truly a conversation"
16:09;16:10;"No, it's not"
16:10;16:12;"Then I say let the conversation begin"
16:12;16:13;"Oh my god, this guy drives me up the wall"
16:13;16:14;"There's something about"
16:14;16:19;"You said that Garth Brooks drives you up the wall?"
16:19;16:21;"Yeah, so the doc is a lot like that"
16:21;16:23;"Except he's weeping through half of the doc"
16:24;16:27;"He's got a little bit of like in that clip, like super villain energy"
16:27;16:32;"His cadence is real like bad guy from a movie"
16:32;16:33;"Just like that"
16:33;16:35;"And I really like that"
16:35;16:38;"I want to post slick stuff, raw stuff"
16:38;16:40;"Wait, so Jake, why does he drive you up the wall?"
16:40;16:40;"What's the phrase?"
16:40;16:43;"Do you say he drives you up a wall or the wall?"
16:43;16:45;"I say the, he drives me up the wall"
16:45;16:47;"I guess a is better"
16:47;16:48;"Garth Brooks drives you up the wall"
16:48;16:50;"He drives me up the wall in this doc"
16:50;16:51;"I mean, I didn't know anything"
16:51;16:52;"I didn't know much about him"
16:52;16:55;"I hadn't really seen him before this doc"
16:55;16:57;"I mean, in terms of being interviewed"
16:57;16:58;"He's just like acting"
16:58;17:02;"It's not like he's giving like a candid interview"
17:02;17:03;"The whole thing is a performance of like"
17:03;17:06;"I'm being so candid and like real with you"
17:06;17:08;"But the whole thing is it's so self-conscious"
17:08;17:11;"And then he'll frequently break down into tears"
17:11;17:14;"Like recalling like an early gig where like"
17:14;17:19;"You know, I was playing at a college bar in Oklahoma"
17:19;17:22;"And I couldn't believe the reaction I got"
17:22;17:25;"And I just knew that music was my life"
17:25;17:29;"It's just like, dude, whatever"
17:29;17:34;"Like he's just like the most banal stories"
17:34;17:36;"That result in him like tearing up"
17:36;17:38;"The guys in his band tear up a lot too"
17:38;17:42;"It's like these very like weepy, doughy guys"
17:42;17:42;"It's just like"
17:42;17:43;"It's okay to cry"
17:43;17:48;"Is this just Garth not living up to your standards of machismo?"
17:48;17:52;"It's Garth being a transparently fraudulent dude"
17:52;17:54;"Like it's just like"
17:54;17:55;"If you're gonna cry, man"
17:55;17:56;"You gotta like"
17:56;17:58;"You bust it out for one moment"
17:58;18:01;"Like where like your dad dies or something"
18:01;18:02;"You can't"
18:02;18:04;"It's literally crying through half the doc"
18:04;18:05;"It's truly insane"
18:05;18:07;"That could be a good title for something"
18:07;18:10;"The transparently fraudulent tears of Garth Brooks"
18:10;18:13;"Like a George Saunders short story"
18:13;18:15;"A collection of poetry by Jake Longstreet"
18:15;18:17;"A series of haikus"
18:18;18:19;"[Laughs]"
18:19;18:20;"Well, yeah"
18:20;18:21;"Because when you're describing it"
18:21;18:21;"It is like"
18:21;18:23;"Of course"
18:23;18:27;"Somebody who's moved by emotion to cry"
18:27;18:28;"That can be a very beautiful thing"
18:28;18:31;"Sometimes people who cry are very in touch with their emotions"
18:31;18:32;"Sure"
18:32;18:33;"But you're right that the"
18:33;18:36;"And I mean you see this discussed quite a bit"
18:36;18:37;"These days online is a"
18:37;18:40;"You know when tears are manipulative"
18:40;18:41;"Yeah hard to diag"
18:41;18:42;"You can't diagnose the guy"
18:42;18:45;"Very performing on a documentary"
18:45;18:46;"But it did seem"
18:46;18:49;"The whole thing seemed very calculated"
18:49;18:50;"Very cloying"
18:50;18:52;"I mean it was fascinating to watch"
18:52;18:54;"Like I said you reminded me of L. Ron Hubbard"
18:54;18:56;"Because he has this smooth kind of delivery"
18:56;18:57;"And it's just like"
18:57;18:59;"Do you even believe what you're saying man?"
18:59;19:00;"Like that kind of thing"
19:00;19:00;"Like"
19:00;19:02;"He's probably in too deep to know"
19:02;19:04;"Right and I was also picturing like"
19:04;19:06;"The guys in his band and his friends"
19:06;19:08;"Just like hating him at this point"
19:08;19:11;"Like there'd be like early footage of them playing gigs in the 80s"
19:11;19:11;"And it'd be like"
19:11;19:12;"It was like oh this is cool"
19:12;19:14;"Like bar band and like"
19:14;19:15;"It's everyone's young and they're playing"
19:15;19:19;"Like and then like he's been with the same musicians for like decades"
19:19;19:23;"And everyone's like in this like beautiful like sterile recording studio"
19:23;19:27;"Doing these like very like intense taping sessions"
19:27;19:29;"And I'm just picturing those guys just like eye rolling"
19:29;19:32;"Like as soon as the camera stops"
19:32;19:34;"I could be totally wrong but I mean I don't know"
19:34;19:39;"We're gonna get an angry email from Garth Brooks' bassist"
19:39;19:40;"Just being like"
19:40;19:41;"How dare you?"
19:41;19:43;"That's my guy"
19:43;19:44;"We weep together"
19:44;19:47;"Garth Brooks is also interesting because he kind of um"
19:47;19:50;"I'm sure other people were involved but he really"
19:50;19:54;"More than anybody else invented the modern country superstar vibe"
19:54;19:58;"Like he is that transitional moment from the 80s to the 90s"
19:58;20:01;"Where of course they're always big country stars"
20:01;20:04;"And I'm sure like in any genre"
20:04;20:07;"Sometimes the biggest stars are a little bizarre"
20:07;20:09;"Because they live in a in a weird bubble"
20:09;20:09;"Yeah"
20:09;20:14;"He was like the first like modern slick stadium country dude"
20:14;20:18;"Well the latest news from Nashville ain't all good but it ain't bad"
20:18;20:23;"The worst I ever found there was the best I ever had"
20:23;20:27;"The new hats and the no hats are still coming on pretty strong"
20:27;20:31;"While me and Chris and John and Willie keep plodding right along"
20:31;20:35;"Clint Black's moved out to Hollywood"
20:35;20:36;"He's in love and that's a fact"
20:36;20:39;"Dunn found himself a movie star"
20:39;20:41;"Gonna show him how to act"
20:41;20:43;"Garth Brooks keeps selling millions"
20:44;20:45;"Well that show ain't no joke"
20:45;20:50;"But I can't help but keep on looking for a pig down in the pole"
20:50;20:54;"On a totally different note we got a major guest coming up today"
20:54;20:55;"Which is Bruce Hornsby"
20:55;20:58;"But before we set him up I just had something that"
20:58;21:00;"I actually made a note that I wanted to discuss today"
21:00;21:03;"Because obviously there's so much going on"
21:03;21:05;"And you know we're back to bi-weekly now"
21:05;21:07;"It's hard to even stay on top of everything that's going on"
21:07;21:10;"But I had a conversation with a friend recently"
21:10;21:12;"And I didn't want to do any research"
21:12;21:13;"I thought maybe we could do some live research"
21:13;21:17;"So Seinfeld get your best number crunching tools ready"
21:17;21:19;"So I was talking to my buddy Andre"
21:19;21:20;"Who I've known for a long time"
21:20;21:21;"We grew up in the same town"
21:21;21:26;"He was telling me about how he used to work in a bike shop in New York"
21:26;21:30;"And that his boss was a fanatic for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups"
21:30;21:31;"And he said..."
21:31;21:34;"I've never heard this before"
21:34;21:38;"So he said that his boss would always be telling him"
21:38;21:43;"To go run to the corner store to buy him a thing of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups"
21:43;21:44;"And sometimes he would eat it"
21:44;21:47;"But other times he would be very disturbed"
21:47;21:48;"He'd like take one bite and say"
21:48;21:49;"You can have the rest of it"
21:49;21:51;"You could have like the other one in the package"
21:51;21:53;"And Andre would be like"
21:53;21:54;"What's wrong with it?"
21:54;21:56;"And that he would say"
21:56;21:58;"This one's a summer edition"
21:58;22:00;"I guess the first time Andre was just like"
22:00;22:00;"What?"
22:00;22:01;"And he's like"
22:01;22:03;"Yeah they're still selling the summer editions"
22:03;22:05;"They didn't get the winter editions yet"
22:05;22:06;"And Andre's like"
22:06;22:08;"The packaging is the same"
22:08;22:10;"He's like it doesn't say on the packaging"
22:10;22:11;"But they taste so different"
22:11;22:14;"In the summer they do a summer edition"
22:14;22:15;"And it's got different chemicals in it"
22:15;22:16;"So it doesn't melt"
22:16;22:19;"But then in the winter they go back to the normal formula"
22:19;22:21;"And I hate it that even once the weather changes"
22:21;22:23;"And you know it's November or December"
22:23;22:25;"Certain stores because they didn't sell it in the summer edition"
22:25;22:26;"They still have them"
22:26;22:29;"And it's very frustrating when you're trying to get a winter edition"
22:29;22:31;"I'd never heard of this in my life"
22:31;22:32;"So I just made a note"
22:32;22:34;"I didn't do any research of course"
22:34;22:36;"In TC fashion"
22:36;22:36;"But I was like"
22:36;22:41;"Either his boss is just like totally nuts"
22:41;22:42;"Has like made up this story in his head"
22:42;22:45;"Or this is like a major bombshell"
22:45;22:49;"Is this a thing that candy bars have different formulas in summer and winter?"
22:49;22:52;"Well first of all Jake have you ever heard of this in your life?"
22:52;22:52;"Never heard of it"
22:52;22:54;"It's a great urban legend"
22:54;22:56;"I don't buy it"
22:56;22:57;"Maybe it was a thing back in the day"
22:57;22:59;"But Seinfeld what'd you find?"
22:59;23:02;"First of all let's start with the fact that there is some precedent for this"
23:02;23:05;"Apparently in the 1930s"
23:05;23:08;"The Reese company was unable to make their chocolate"
23:08;23:09;"Because it was too hot"
23:09;23:12;"And they didn't have the proper cooling and air conditioning systems"
23:12;23:15;"So what they did is in the winter months"
23:15;23:17;"They turned to a canning company"
23:17;23:19;"They would can beans and tomatoes"
23:19;23:22;"In the months when they couldn't make chocolate"
23:22;23:26;"And then revert back to the chocolate when it cooled down"
23:26;23:28;"That's totally insane"
23:28;23:29;"Wait wait so hold on"
23:29;23:31;"They just stopped making chocolate in the winter?"
23:31;23:32;"Yeah correct"
23:32;23:34;"It was a seasonal confection"
23:34;23:36;"I can believe that in the 30s"
23:37;23:40;"If you're sending a truck out from your factory"
23:40;23:42;"And by the time it gets there it's melted"
23:42;23:44;"And then you got the shop owners calling you angrily"
23:44;23:46;"It's like I got this stuff yesterday"
23:46;23:48;"Today it's all a mess I can't sell it"
23:48;23:50;"You'd be like alright let's just pause"
23:50;23:52;"But is there anything about"
23:52;23:56;"Did they learn from that and start changing the formula?"
23:56;23:59;"So you know I haven't had a ton of time to really dig deep here"
23:59;24:00;"But from what I can tell"
24:00;24:03;"According to the first few pages of Google"
24:03;24:06;"There's no different summer recipe in the winter"
24:06;24:10;"Unless this is something that's like a deep Reese's secret"
24:10;24:12;"But I mean maybe what your friend is talking about"
24:12;24:15;"Is that they have a certain amount of inventory"
24:15;24:17;"That they produce for half the year"
24:17;24:18;"And then maybe it gets a little stale"
24:18;24:20;"Near the end of the season"
24:20;24:23;"And then they refresh it"
24:23;24:26;"But I'm not seeing anything on a different recipe"
24:26;24:29;"Based on you know different seasons or anything like that"
24:29;24:32;"Fresh mass-produced candy"
24:32;24:34;"Just stuffed with preservatives"
24:34;24:38;"I mean look we've all had something that wasn't technically expired"
24:38;24:41;"Like a candy bar but just didn't taste that good"
24:41;24:44;"Because it was like a little bit old"
24:44;24:45;"I'm not sure if I have"
24:45;24:48;"You never had like a Nature Valley granola bar and just like"
24:48;24:51;"Granola bar is a little different"
24:51;24:54;"I feel like a Snickers and a Reese's that kind of stuff"
24:54;24:56;"That's like truly pure chemicals"
24:56;24:58;"You've never had a stale Snickers?"
24:58;24:59;"I don't think so"
25:00;25:02;"And you know I'm eating five or six Snickers a year"
25:02;25:07;"They do have some seasonal Reese products that come out around"
25:07;25:10;"Like there's like Reese Easter egg"
25:10;25:12;"Which comes out around Easter"
25:12;25:13;"That kind of thing"
25:13;25:16;"But I'm now like seven pages deep into Google"
25:16;25:17;"Not seeing anything like that"
25:17;25:18;"And nobody's talking about it"
25:18;25:20;"No variance between the recipes"
25:20;25:24;"I just like this boss character who's obsessed with Reese's"
25:24;25:27;"Like I also like that it's like one man's fight for the truth"
25:28;25:30;"It's almost like some QAnon conspiracy theory"
25:30;25:33;"Just like showing up at the Reese's factory"
25:33;25:36;"Like I'm a journalist holding a camera"
25:36;25:37;"The people have a right to see"
25:37;25:40;"And they're just like ""Sir we do not change the formula"""
25:40;25:43;"He's like ""They do, I know they do"""
25:43;25:44;"I mean you know it's also kind of like"
25:44;25:46;"Do you guys believe in chemtrails?"
25:46;25:47;"No"
25:47;25:51;"You don't think that none of the lines in the sky made by planes"
25:51;25:55;"Are chemicals that the government's using for one reason or another?"
25:55;25:56;"Do you believe in it?"
25:56;25:58;"I do believe that planes leave trails"
25:58;26:01;"I kind of remember seeing a video a long time ago"
26:01;26:04;"That was like a guy who's just obsessed with chemtrails"
26:04;26:06;"So he'd just be like sitting in his like suburban backyard"
26:06;26:08;"Pointing his like phone at the sky"
26:08;26:10;"And just like you would just see like"
26:10;26:12;"What appeared to be a regular commercial plane"
26:12;26:16;"Just like zipping across the sky leaving the famous trail"
26:16;26:16;"Yeah"
26:16;26:17;"And this guy would just be like zooming in on it"
26:17;26:21;"And just be like ""You bastards, wow"""
26:21;26:25;"""Oh here comes another one, you absolute pieces of sh*t"""
26:25;26:27;"Every plane he saw he was just kind of like"
26:27;26:30;"""Oh man, look at all these chemicals"""
26:30;26:33;"So of course I don't believe that every plane is doing that"
26:33;26:34;"I gotta research it a little more"
26:34;26:37;"I'm not up on the deep parts of the conspiracy theory"
26:37;26:39;"But I guess the one thing about it"
26:39;26:41;"That I'm sure there is some precedent for"
26:41;26:44;"Is that I think the reason people believe in chemtrails"
26:44;26:48;"Is because the idea that the government"
26:48;26:52;"Or some the Illuminati or big corporate America or something"
26:52;26:56;"Has some reason to put chemicals into the atmosphere"
26:56;26:59;"Obviously there's precedents for that belief system"
26:59;27:02;"Obviously there's like fluoridated water in some places"
27:02;27:04;"Sometimes it's for a good reason"
27:04;27:06;"And then you have these dark stories about like"
27:06;27:08;"Big corporations like Nestle or something"
27:08;27:13;"Experimenting on desperate people in a third world country"
27:13;27:15;"Making the women use their formula and studying it"
27:15;27:19;"So there's the idea that there could be things we don't know"
27:19;27:22;"About what's going into our food or our atmosphere"
27:22;27:24;"I buy that"
27:24;27:27;"So you know maybe there's a bit of healthy skepticism"
27:27;27:30;"In both chemtrail conspiracy theorists"
27:30;27:32;"And Reese's conspiracy theorists"
27:32;27:34;"So you are chemtrail curious"
27:34;27:38;"Are you Reese's winter edition curious?"
27:38;27:41;"I'm convinced that the government puts really bad stuff"
27:41;27:43;"In Reese's in the summer"
27:43;27:44;"Not just to keep them from melting"
27:44;27:46;"But also to control our minds"
27:46;27:48;"So I believe that"
27:48;27:50;"And I believe there's a dude in Brooklyn"
27:50;27:53;"Who has such an advanced palate"
27:53;27:53;"You can tell"
27:53;27:56;"But truthfully he might have a very advanced palate"
27:56;27:59;"And maybe it is just that he can tell"
27:59;28:02;"When a Reese's has been sitting at the corner store"
28:02;28:04;"For two weeks versus two months"
28:04;28:06;"I'm willing to believe that"
28:06;28:08;"And that he might..."
28:08;28:09;"Somebody told him once"
28:09;28:10;"Oh yeah it's because there's different editions"
28:10;28:12;"And now he just assumes when he bites in"
28:12;28:14;"It tastes kind of funny that that's why"
28:14;28:16;"So you know in that sense he's not wrong"
28:17;28:18;"That something's different"
28:18;28:20;"It might just be nature"
28:20;28:21;"It just might be all father time"
28:21;28:25;"A Reese's peanut butter cup has a shelf life"
28:25;28:27;"Of about nine to twelve months"
28:27;28:28;"Well that's pretty crazy"
28:28;28:30;"To imagine that you could be going to a store"
28:30;28:32;"You could be eating one that's a day old"
28:32;28:34;"You could be eating one that's 12 months old"
28:34;28:35;"That's a big difference"
28:35;28:38;"I wonder where they're manufactured"
28:38;28:40;"If there's only like one place that manufactures them"
28:40;28:41;"There are several plants"
28:41;28:45;"There's one in Ashland, Lancaster, PA, Hazleton, Memphis"
28:46;28:49;"Hershey, Robinson, Illinois"
28:49;28:50;"Any west coast?"
28:50;28:53;"Oregon, there's Ashland, Oregon"
28:53;28:54;"There you go"
28:54;28:56;"That's your west coast distro"
28:56;29:00;"Well if anybody has any info about this conspiracy theory"
29:00;29:02;"Or just personal experience"
29:02;29:02;"Please let us know"
29:02;29:04;"Because I would love to get to the bottom of this"
29:04;29:07;"I'm not entirely convinced that this man is not correct"
29:07;29:10;"There's a little something more going on in the Reese's universe"
29:10;29:14;"All right Jake we got a true legend coming on the show"
29:14;29:15;"I know this is crazy"
29:15;29:16;"This is a really big one"
29:16;29:19;"We're going to be talking to Bruce Hornsby"
29:19;29:22;"Of course he barely needs an introduction"
29:22;29:26;"I'm sure everybody at the bare minimum knows his song ""The Way It Is"""
29:26;29:28;"Which was a big hit in the 80s"
29:28;29:32;"Introduced to a whole new generation via Tupac in the late 90s"
29:32;29:34;"A posthumously released song called ""Changes"""
29:34;29:37;"So he's done amazing work solo with his albums"
29:37;29:38;"He put out with his band The Range"
29:38;29:42;"And then of course he played over 100 shows with The Dead"
29:42;29:45;"So he's a big part of the Grateful Dead universe"
29:45;29:48;"Um he's got a new album coming out"
29:48;29:50;"That has a friend of the show Justin Vernon"
29:50;29:51;"Jameela Woods"
29:51;29:52;"Leon Russell"
29:52;29:55;"And Vernon Reed from Living Color"
29:55;29:58;"He just dropped a single with James Mercer from The Shins"
29:58;30:00;"It's a very cool song"
30:00;30:01;"He's been doing it for decades"
30:01;30:06;"Now Justin Vernon really introduced Bruce Hornsby to a whole new generation"
30:06;30:08;"Because Justin, I think he talked about it when he came on Time Crisis"
30:08;30:10;"He's a massive fan"
30:10;30:12;"And if you listen to the Boney Ver albums"
30:12;30:14;"At least the second and third ones"
30:14;30:15;"And the fourth"
30:15;30:17;"When Justin shouts out Bruce Hornsby"
30:17;30:17;"He's not just being like"
30:17;30:20;"""Oh no, he's a great pianist and songwriter"""
30:20;30:22;"Bruce Hornsby is a fundamental"
30:22;30:25;"He's a cornerstone of Justin's music"
30:25;30:25;"Yeah"
30:25;30:26;"In a huge way"
30:26;30:27;"But anyway, even before"
30:27;30:28;"I guess Justin's a lifelong fan"
30:28;30:33;"But even before he kind of introduced yet another generation to Bruce"
30:33;30:36;"Jake, I feel like you were flying the flag way back in the day"
30:36;30:38;"You've been a longtime fan, right?"
30:38;30:39;"I guess so, yeah"
30:39;30:40;"I mean I just, you know"
30:40;30:42;"I'd always, like I'd heard the songs"
30:42;30:46;"""Mandolin Rain"" and ""The Way It Is"" on the radio"
30:46;30:48;"And just was like, always loved them"
30:48;30:51;"Bought the first record years ago"
30:51;30:52;"Always had it"
30:52;30:55;"I never like checked out his work before that"
30:55;30:57;"But yeah, I just always thought it was like incredibly"
30:57;31:00;"Melodic, beautiful playing"
31:00;31:01;"And great songwriting"
31:01;31:03;"And I always was a fan, yeah"
31:03;31:05;"I guess maybe when I was, you know, into it"
31:05;31:07;"Like whatever that was 15, 20 years ago"
31:07;31:09;"It was like seeing his son of like"
31:10;31:13;"Cheesy, like adult kind of soft rock or something"
31:13;31:17;"You know how people would like clown on like Phil Collins 20 years ago?"
31:17;31:17;"Yo, totally"
31:17;31:19;"Even though his music, obviously"
31:19;31:21;"As a musician and a piano player"
31:21;31:23;"It's just on another level"
31:23;31:24;"But I think a big part of that"
31:24;31:26;"Which is something we've discussed on the show before"
31:26;31:28;"Is like in the 90s"
31:28;31:32;"The 90s was actually one of the harshest decades in a way"
31:32;31:35;"Because people hated on the previous decades so hard"
31:35;31:35;"Right"
31:35;31:37;"It's not like now in 2020"
31:37;31:38;"People are like"
31:38;31:40;"Of course, there's always going to be this awkward time"
31:40;31:43;"When people like feel a little bit funny about things"
31:43;31:44;"That came out 10 years ago"
31:44;31:46;"Because it's like the uncanny valley"
31:46;31:48;"But you don't have that same kind of just like"
31:48;31:51;"Oh my god, the 2000s were pathetic"
31:51;31:53;"The 2010s ruled"
31:53;31:56;"But in the 90s, there really was this like hatred of like"
31:56;31:58;"Some of the synth tones of the 80s"
31:58;32:01;"And you know, Bruce Hornby came out in the 80s"
32:01;32:03;"So his music is very idiosyncratic"
32:03;32:05;"But it, of course, it sounds like the 80s"
32:05;32:06;"So I think in some ways"
32:06;32:08;"A lot of artists from the 80s"
32:08;32:10;"Especially ones that had like a mellower sound"
32:10;32:12;"Or had moments of like soft rock"
32:12;32:15;"It was seen as like deeply uncool compared to like"
32:15;32:17;"I don't know, like bargain bin grunge music"
32:17;32:19;"From the next decade"
32:19;32:20;"And it probably took like"
32:20;32:21;"Other people to be like"
32:21;32:21;"Wait, what are you talking about?"
32:21;32:24;"This is like excellent American music"
32:24;32:26;"And especially when you really look at it"
32:26;32:29;"Such a cool mix of Americana"
32:29;32:31;"A little bit of jam"
32:31;32:33;"Cutting edge 80s production"
32:33;32:35;"It's really fascinating music"
32:35;32:37;"Like some bluegrass sort of"
32:37;32:40;"Yeah, it's like truly Americana meets 80s"
32:40;32:41;"Well, talking about his 80s work"
32:41;32:43;"At least the first two big albums"
32:43;32:45;"Well, anyway, let's talk to the man himself"
32:45;32:47;"Can we get Bruce Hornsby on the horn?"
32:47;32:51;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
32:51;32:56;"Oh, hey, Bruce?"
32:56;32:56;"Yeah, yeah"
32:56;32:58;"Oh, hey, how are you doing, man?"
32:58;32:59;"Sucking too bad"
32:59;33:00;"Oh, cool, I'm Ezra"
33:00;33:02;"This is my co-host, Jake"
33:02;33:03;"Welcome to Time Crisis"
33:03;33:03;"Hey"
33:03;33:04;"Jake and I are both big fans"
33:04;33:07;"And we're very honored to have you on the show"
33:07;33:08;"So where are you calling from?"
33:08;33:09;"Williamsburg, Virginia"
33:09;33:11;"The colonial tourist town"
33:11;33:14;"You may have been dragged there in seventh grade"
33:14;33:16;"On a school field trip"
33:16;33:17;"It would have been the local townies"
33:17;33:19;"Helping you with water balloons"
33:19;33:22;"That was our self-appointed job"
33:22;33:23;"When we grew up in this town"
33:23;33:25;"So Williamsburg, Virginia"
33:25;33:26;"That's your hometown"
33:26;33:27;"Yeah, I grew up here"
33:27;33:29;"And I went away to school"
33:29;33:30;"I did a little bit of school hopping"
33:30;33:32;"I started at University of Richmond"
33:32;33:34;"Just an hour away from here"
33:34;33:38;"But it was one year of normal college"
33:38;33:40;"Enough for me to realize that I wanted to cast my light"
33:40;33:43;"Unequivocally with the musos"
33:43;33:45;"Much to the chagrin of my parents"
33:45;33:45;"Who made me"
33:45;33:48;"He said, ""Okay, well, if you want to do this, you pay for it"""
33:48;33:49;"And so I did"
33:49;33:52;"And then I went to Berkeley College of Music in Boston"
33:52;33:55;"And then finished my last two years at the U of M"
33:55;33:58;"Suntan U, University of Miami"
33:58;34:01;"And that was a great experience for me"
34:01;34:04;"And then came back home and started a band"
34:04;34:05;"And we got discovered"
34:05;34:08;"And we moved to LA in 1980"
34:08;34:10;"I lived in LA for 10 years, 80 to 90"
34:10;34:13;"And then came back here in 1990"
34:13;34:14;"And that's it"
34:14;34:16;"My next move is into a pine box"
34:16;34:19;"Heavy"
34:19;34:25;"Well, at least you'll be underneath the green, green grass at home"
34:25;34:27;"Yes, that's right"
34:27;34:28;"That's absolutely right"
34:28;34:31;"It's interesting that, yeah, you lived in LA for a decade"
34:31;34:33;"But made it out of the jungle"
34:33;34:35;"I did, yes, that's right"
34:35;34:38;"And tried to find some property like we did"
34:38;34:41;"Away from people as, you know, as I get older"
34:41;34:43;"I'm increasingly misanthropic"
34:43;34:46;"And so I like living out in the woods"
34:46;34:48;"It's just great for me"
34:48;34:51;"But look, LA for me was a necessary place to be"
34:51;34:54;"And I learned a lot out there"
34:54;34:56;"I came out there and realized what good was"
34:56;34:58;"Because around here in Virginia"
34:58;35:00;"There's some good music going on"
35:00;35:02;"But nothing like out there"
35:02;35:06;"And so I just got a sense of what good is"
35:06;35:09;"So it helped me and kept on going"
35:09;35:13;"And was fortunate enough to get something going out there"
35:13;35:16;"So you already gave us some of like the rough biography"
35:16;35:16;"Yeah"
35:16;35:19;"Why don't you take us to the early days of The Range"
35:19;35:22;"How that came together and kind of moving into your first album"
35:22;35:24;"Well, we ate a lot of junk food"
35:24;35:26;"I hear you guys like to talk about that"
35:26;35:27;"So I'll throw that in there"
35:27;35:28;"Oh, definitely"
35:28;35:30;"Mid-80s, Bruce Horn is being The Range"
35:30;35:31;"What were you guys snacking on?"
35:31;35:33;"Carl's Jr."
35:33;35:34;"Okay"
35:34;35:36;"The big burger, you know, an in-and-out burger"
35:36;35:38;"Carl's Jr. in the East Coast"
35:38;35:40;"Aren't you guys a little bit from the East?"
35:40;35:42;"Yeah, actually I grew up in Jersey"
35:42;35:43;"And Jake's from Connecticut"
35:43;35:46;"So yeah, we're both out here mostly in California these days"
35:46;35:48;"But definitely East Coast guys"
35:48;35:52;"Okay, so you know Carl's Jr. is the West Coast version of Hardee's"
35:52;35:53;"At least that's my impression"
35:53;35:56;"Yes, all the same branding and basically the same menu"
35:56;35:58;"Yeah, I think that's true"
35:58;36:03;"Yeah, the one-third pound thick burger is something that can really clog a vein"
36:03;36:04;"But I'm not against it"
36:04;36:09;"I just remember going to Carl's Jr. one time with my guitar player Pete Harris"
36:09;36:13;"I drove this funky-ass old station wagon"
36:13;36:14;"And I never washed it"
36:14;36:15;"And it was just a wreck"
36:15;36:21;"And I walk in and we've kind of gotten ourselves going fairly strongly"
36:21;36:22;"On our first record at that time"
36:22;36:25;"We're going to Carl's Jr. taking a break from rehearsal"
36:25;36:29;"Then I go back to the car where some guy accosts me and says"
36:29;36:31;"""Oh, come on man, you can do better than that"""
36:31;36:33;"He just recognized you?"
36:33;36:35;"I guess he did, yeah"
36:35;36:36;"I guess he did"
36:36;36:37;"And then he saw me get into this jalopy"
36:37;36:42;"Because cars have never been that heavily gave a rat's about"
36:42;36:45;"That's just why I think of Carl's Jr."
36:45;36:48;"Because that was just a funny little moment, little vignette"
36:48;36:50;"There's a guy somewhere just telling people"
36:50;36:53;"Like once in the mid-80s I saw"
36:53;36:56;"Bruce Willis be rolling into a Carl's Jr."
36:56;36:58;"Then he got in this f***ing car"
36:58;36:59;"It was just sad, man"
36:59;37:03;"With his old, mobile, Cutlass 98 station wagon, yeah"
37:03;37:04;"So one question I have for you"
37:04;37:08;"Because we're going to ask you a lot of questions about The Grateful Dead shortly"
37:08;37:10;"But you're born in '54"
37:10;37:14;"So you're in your late 20s, early 30s around this era of..."
37:14;37:15;"You're in LA"
37:15;37:20;"And I know that you'd been a big fan of The Dead previously"
37:20;37:22;"And then we'll talk about you actually playing with them later"
37:22;37:25;"But so at this point you're somebody who's been interested"
37:25;37:26;"And I'm sure a lot of music"
37:26;37:30;"But certainly jazz and The Dead and Americana"
37:30;37:31;"But you're from a different generation than those guys"
37:31;37:37;"So when I'm picturing like you in LA, 1980 to '84"
37:37;37:39;"For me when I picture LA then"
37:39;37:44;"I'm picturing like really big-time slick record business music"
37:44;37:47;"I'm also picturing just like Black Flag and X"
37:47;37:50;"And like punk and hardcore and like kind of Repo Man vibes"
37:50;37:54;"So I guess I'm curious, what scene did you see yourself in?"
37:54;38:01;"Well I'd say probably I would fit in with the Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter crowd"
38:01;38:08;"You know the Jackson Brown, CSN, Warren Zvon, Tom Petty"
38:08;38:10;"You mentioned Americana"
38:10;38:13;"So those I would say are sort of tangential to what's called Americana"
38:13;38:17;"All those people are like minimum, you know, five to ten years older than you"
38:17;38:20;"You're like the young dude kind of in the mix?"
38:20;38:21;"Well at first I couldn't get arrested"
38:21;38:26;"At first I was just some sad sack out there playing on publishing demos"
38:26;38:27;"Just to pay the rent"
38:27;38:30;"I was a staff songwriter for 20th Century Fox"
38:30;38:32;"It sounds like a big deal"
38:32;38:33;"But it really wasn't"
38:33;38:36;"It was kind of a B-team publishing company"
38:36;38:40;"And they thought I was going to get signed and all that business"
38:40;38:43;"Lenny Warren, the great Lenny Warren, Kurt Warner Brothers"
38:43;38:45;"Gave me some demo money in '82"
38:45;38:49;"But he just ended up passing what we gave him"
38:49;38:52;"And he was right, I really wasn't ready then"
38:52;38:57;"So when I started rubbing shoulders with that crowd that I was mentioning"
38:57;38:59;"Well that was after, you know, first record came out in '86"
38:59;39:02;"And then that went pretty far pretty fast"
39:02;39:07;"And then these people started to know me and ask me to do things for them"
39:07;39:10;"Probably about '88 and then on and on"
39:10;39:14;"So then starting from about '89, you know, I was getting calls from Don Henley to write"
39:14;39:17;"And we wrote that song, ""End of the Innocence"""
39:17;39:20;"And then I started getting calls to play on people's records"
39:20;39:22;"And man, that was amazing"
39:22;39:25;"I just got to jump into different people's worlds"
39:25;39:29;"Who I, you know, iconic artist's worlds who I loved"
39:29;39:31;"It was sort of like painting yourself into the mural"
39:31;39:34;"That you were looking at the poster you had on your wall"
39:34;39:38;"And so I wrote a song with Robbie Robertson for one of his records"
39:38;39:41;"And then played on a Dylan record and a Bob Seger record"
39:41;39:44;"And the Bonnie Raitt record that's so well known"
39:44;39:47;"So when I started hanging out with him, yes, there was a clear"
39:48;39:51;"Little brother vibe, I guess you could say, from them toward me"
39:51;39:56;"But it was very kind, it was very warm and embracing"
39:56;40:04;"And so I guess you would say I was trying to be sort of an American rocker, you know"
40:04;40:09;"Cougar, Petty, Springsteen, that kind of thing"
40:09;40:14;"But when I started playing piano, getting a little more of the jazz influence"
40:14;40:17;"Of my piano playing into the music on the first record"
40:17;40:21;"That's what actually sort of made it seem a little more special"
40:21;40:26;"Than just another guy plying his trade with some guitars and B3s"
40:26;40:31;"Standing in line, marking time, waiting for the welfare dime"
40:31;40:33;"'Cause they can't buy a job"
40:33;40:39;"A man in a silk suit hurries by as he catches the poor old lady's eyes"
40:39;40:43;"Just for fun he says, ""Get a job"""
40:43;40:48;"That's just the way it is"
40:48;40:52;"Some things will never change"
40:55;40:56;"That's just the way it is"
40:56;41:01;"Ah, but don't you believe them"
41:01;41:04;"So let's talk about The Dead a bit"
41:04;41:09;"Because you had kind of like a Dead cover band when you were growing up"
41:09;41:11;"Well actually I didn't, I was not a..."
41:11;41:15;"When I started playing the piano, I started playing late, age 17"
41:15;41:20;"And I got into it because my older brother was the real muse of the family"
41:20;41:22;"Because I was more of a jock at the time"
41:22;41:25;"Kind of like the Justin Vernon of Williamsburg, Virginia"
41:25;41:28;"Right, and you were into sports basketball"
41:28;41:28;"Exactly"
41:28;41:32;"So he got me into Elton John and Leon Russell"
41:32;41:33;"And that got me into the piano"
41:33;41:34;"And it came pretty naturally for me"
41:34;41:38;"I played guitar, had little bands in 6th grade, 7th grade"
41:38;41:39;"Battled the bands, winners"
41:39;41:42;"And mostly we won because we had my older brothers"
41:42;41:44;"Again, the big brother, badass musician"
41:44;41:49;"Had his Fender Bandmasters and Dual Showmans"
41:49;41:50;"And we were just louder than everybody else"
41:50;41:52;"So that's probably why we won"
41:52;41:55;"So my brother Bobby Hornsby, my older brother"
41:55;41:56;"He was a huge Deadhead"
41:56;42:00;"He was in this Grateful Dead hippie fraternity at University of Virginia"
42:00;42:04;"That used to drop acid, paint their faces and go play intramural volleyball"
42:04;42:09;"They just were lucky if they ever hit the ball once"
42:09;42:13;"They probably lost 15-0, 15-0, 15-1"
42:13;42:16;"If somebody hit it too long"
42:16;42:20;"So he had a band called Bobby Hightest and the Octane Kids"
42:21;42:27;"And he had me come up in my second semester of my freshman year at University of Richmond"
42:27;42:30;"I was little Brucie playing Fender Rhodes and singing lead"
42:30;42:34;"And singing Jack Straw, etc"
42:34;42:37;"So we would play four grain alcohol parties"
42:37;42:39;"Frat parties with three layers of dancers"
42:39;42:41;"The normal dancers, the people dancing on tables in the back"
42:41;42:44;"And the people doing the Dying Cockroach on the floor"
42:44;42:47;"Those wild, wild times"
42:47;42:48;"But great fun"
42:48;42:49;"And so I got into the Dead"
42:49;42:50;"I liked them a lot"
42:50;42:52;"I loved Europe '72"
42:52;42:53;"That was the first record I had"
42:53;42:55;"And that just, that was a big deal for me"
42:55;42:58;"That and the band's Rock of Ages"
42:58;43:00;"Along with Elton and Leon"
43:00;43:03;"Because if you remember in that era"
43:03;43:08;"Elton's music was very much influenced by that Americana"
43:08;43:10;"But by the band, frankly, specifically"
43:10;43:12;"Tumbleweed Connection, that record"
43:12;43:13;"With Burn Down the Mission"
43:13;43:15;"The great Burn Down the Mission at Amarina"
43:15;43:16;"Country Comfort"
43:16;43:19;"So much greatness on that record"
43:19;43:21;"The great Paul Buckmaster string arrangements"
43:21;43:24;"I mean, they just came out and said it"
43:24;43:26;"This is our version of the band"
43:26;43:27;"And then same with Mad Men Across the Water"
43:27;43:31;"With Indian Sunset and on and on"
43:31;43:32;"I'm a big Elton fan as well"
43:32;43:34;"And I've always been interested in that"
43:34;43:36;"Because obviously his public image"
43:36;43:38;"Being an English dude with the big glasses"
43:38;43:41;"And the flashy sequined outfits"
43:41;43:45;"Couldn't be more different than the kind of plain Jane vibe of the Dead"
43:45;43:46;"-Exactly, that's right -Or the band"
43:46;43:51;"But he's always said Leon Russell was his huge inspiration as a piano player"
43:51;43:52;"Big fan of the band"
43:52;43:54;"And then Bernie Taupin, his lyricist"
43:54;43:57;"Another just suburban English guy"
43:57;43:59;"So obsessed with the American West"
43:59;44:01;"-Absolutely -Great point that you mentioned"
44:01;44:04;"Because Elton John, I think today"
44:04;44:08;"It's easy to forget how much his music is rooted in Americana"
44:08;44:09;"And everything's always happening on the farm"
44:09;44:11;"It's such a funny juxtaposition"
44:11;44:13;"Yeah, everything's happening on the farm"
44:13;44:15;"Right, exactly"
44:15;44:19;"Yeah, all the pines will be falling everywhere"
44:19;44:21;"You know, all that stuff is straight out of..."
44:21;44:23;"You could hear Richard Manuel singing the same thing"
44:23;44:25;"Or LeVon, of course"
44:25;44:26;"So I was into all that"
44:26;44:27;"Now Leon..."
44:27;44:30;"And Elton had his gospel roots too"
44:30;44:33;"You know, ""Holy Moses I have been received"""
44:33;44:36;"But the real gospel titan to me was Leon"
44:36;44:37;"I don't know if you..."
44:37;44:39;"Most people see... they know Leon"
44:39;44:41;"I think it's a little bit like Elton too"
44:41;44:42;"Most people know Elton from his hits"
44:43;44:46;"Possibly my favorite record of Elton's is ""Tumblewee Connection"""
44:46;44:49;"Which was the one record back then that had no hits on it"
44:49;44:50;"But it was just... to me"
44:50;44:54;"Just had this deep gravitas musically and lyrically"
44:54;44:56;"And so Leon..."
44:56;44:58;"I know this now because I got to work with him a ton"
44:58;45:01;"And so I really got to know him and got to know..."
45:01;45:03;"I thought I could do a good Leon Russ limitation"
45:03;45:05;"Until I actually started hanging with him"
45:05;45:08;"Then I realized it was way deeper than my sorry little impression"
45:08;45:10;"But I was able to learn at the feet of the master"
45:10;45:14;"And learn how to do a credible Leon imitation"
45:14;45:16;"And he told me his music came..."
45:16;45:21;"His biggest influence was a beautiful black church group"
45:21;45:23;"Called the Church of God and Christ"
45:23;45:24;"Kojic for short"
45:24;45:26;"Based in Memphis"
45:26;45:28;"And their music..."
45:28;45:31;"For instance if you listen to Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers"
45:31;45:35;"Though are you into those old gospel records from the early 50s?"
45:35;45:38;"- I don't know if I know early 50s Sam Cooke"
45:38;45:41;"- Well check it out Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers"
45:41;45:45;"We've been using that music as our pre-show music for about 20 years now"
45:45;45:46;"Maybe longer"
45:46;45:49;"And it's just once again a deep well"
45:49;45:52;"And you'll hear in the background"
45:52;45:54;"Because the vocals are so up front"
45:54;45:56;"But sometimes they have instruments playing"
45:56;46:04;"That kind of octave piano playing"
46:04;46:07;"Which is so Leon-esque"
46:07;46:10;"Or you know and so I guess Leon is Kojic-esque"
46:10;46:13;"And so that's where he got all that"
46:13;46:18;"And again such a deep well of soul and groove"
46:18;46:20;"And just musicality"
46:20;46:23;"So I grokked all that"
46:23;46:24;"Or tried to"
46:24;46:27;"So that's also very American"
46:27;46:33;"But not quite as sort of folk as Elton and the band were doing"
46:33;46:35;"It was a little more bluesy"
46:35;46:37;"Not that the band wasn't bluesy"
46:37;46:40;"But Leon was really bluesy"
46:40;46:42;"And so I loved all that"
46:42;46:43;"And that got me into Dr. John"
46:43;46:45;"And on and on and on"
46:45;46:47;"So I could bore the dog @#$@ out of you"
46:47;46:47;"So I stopped"
46:47;46:52;"- So that's kind of your piano lineage is those guys"
46:52;46:56;"- Well but then I used to read Rolling Stone magazine"
46:56;47:02;"And I saw this full page review of two albums by this guy named Keith Jarrett"
47:03;47:05;"And one of them was Expectations"
47:05;47:08;"Which was the only record that he made for Columbia"
47:08;47:10;"Where they put strings on the record"
47:10;47:14;"And tried to make him commercial quote unquote"
47:14;47:17;"And his first solo piano record called Facing You"
47:17;47:21;"Which was then on the import only label ECM"
47:21;47:24;"And so I was intrigued by that"
47:24;47:26;"But you couldn't find those records in Williamsburg, VA"
47:26;47:30;"But I went to a trip looking for schools in Boston"
47:30;47:34;"And I went to the local store, whatever it was called"
47:34;47:36;"And found the import section and found this"
47:36;47:38;"You know how, and I'm sure you'd know Ezra"
47:38;47:42;"When you're that age and you're deeply interested"
47:42;47:44;"And you're looking for something obscure"
47:44;47:47;"It's such a eureka moment when you happen to find it"
47:47;47:49;"You know a thousand, six hundred miles"
47:49;47:51;"Seven hundred miles away from where you are"
47:51;47:53;"So that I remember it like it was yesterday"
47:53;47:56;"And took that record home and put it on"
47:56;47:58;"And that kind of changed my life"
47:58;48:04;"I really moved away from what I had been involved with before"
48:04;48:08;"With the Eltons and Leon and Dr. John and all that"
48:08;48:13;"So that made me dive headfirst into that world"
48:13;48:14;"Which is a deep world"
48:14;48:17;"You can dive into that world and never come up"
48:17;48:20;"And it might not be the best thing for you to do that"
48:20;48:24;"But soon enough I was headlong down the path of"
48:24;48:27;"What the hell is this guy doing?"
48:27;48:29;"How can I figure this out?"
48:29;48:31;"And so that's, and I'm still trying to"
48:31;48:33;"One thing that I'm kind of curious about is"
48:33;48:37;"When I picture the late 70s and the early 80s"
48:37;48:38;"Which would have been the time"
48:38;48:41;"Kind of just before your career really took off"
48:41;48:44;"And I imagine you're figuring a lot of stuff out as an artist"
48:44;48:46;"Creatively and also just career-wise"
48:46;48:49;"So when I picture the late 70s, early 80s"
48:49;48:53;"I always picture that that was this time when"
48:53;48:56;"What was considered very cutting-edge music"
48:56;48:58;"There's like the beginnings of hip-hop and punk"
48:58;49:02;"And there's still disco and post-disco"
49:02;49:05;"You know, obviously you could connect all those musics"
49:05;49:07;"Back to Americana and jazz"
49:07;49:09;"And some of the things we've been talking about"
49:09;49:11;"But those things were considered"
49:11;49:14;"These very new cutting-edge types of music"
49:14;49:18;"There were all sorts of new archetypes of stars"
49:18;49:19;"In every genre coming out"
49:19;49:21;"And one thing's for sure"
49:21;49:23;"Even though they were still selling a lot of tickets"
49:23;49:24;"A band like The Grateful Dead"
49:24;49:28;"A band that also, their influences include jazz and Americana"
49:28;49:29;"And all these things combined"
49:29;49:33;"Their cool factor may have been at an all-time low"
49:33;49:35;"Like of course, they have very dedicated fans"
49:35;49:37;"But it was still, you know, a significant amount of time"
49:37;49:39;"Before the kind of revival"
49:39;49:40;"Where everybody started to be like"
49:40;49:43;"""Oh yeah, The Grateful Dead, they are maybe the greatest American band"""
49:43;49:44;"So I guess I'm curious"
49:44;49:46;"What did that time period feel like for you"
49:46;49:48;"As somebody who's kind of figuring out"
49:48;49:49;"What you were interested in"
49:49;49:51;"Did you ever have an impulse like"
49:51;49:53;"""Maybe I should stop listening to Keith Jarrett"""
49:53;49:55;"And just like try to write some new wave songs?"
49:55;49:58;"Well, to address something you just said"
49:58;50:01;"Do you really think the Dead gave a rat's ass"
50:01;50:02;"Whether they were cool or not?"
50:02;50:04;"I really don't think they did"
50:04;50:06;"Oh no, I don't think the Dead did"
50:06;50:09;"But I'm curious about an up-and-coming Deadhead like you"
50:09;50:10;"In your mid-20s"
50:10;50:11;"Who's looking out at like"
50:11;50:14;"""How am I going to make a living and express myself as an artist?"""
50:14;50:16;"Yeah, okay, well for one thing"
50:16;50:17;"I wasn't really a Deadhead"
50:17;50:18;"I was definitely a fan"
50:18;50:21;"But I was more of a Keith ""Herbie"" Chick McCoy-head"
50:21;50:22;"Right, I see"
50:22;50:27;"The 401 Namers who constitute the pantheon of modern jazz piano"
50:27;50:27;"Yes"
50:27;50:31;"So man, I was pretty, I'm kind of a slow learner in this way"
50:31;50:33;"Because I didn't start writing songs"
50:33;50:37;"I was so into playing and that was it in my college years"
50:37;50:42;"So I came to songwriting, I considered pretty late, 22, 23"
50:42;50:44;"We got out of college, we put together a band"
50:44;50:46;"And said ""Okay, well how do you make it?"""
50:46;50:48;"""Oh, I guess somebody's got to write the songs"""
50:48;50:49;"""You know, well you know the most chords"""
50:49;50:51;"""Well, I guess why don't you do it?"""
50:51;50:53;"So, or I just signed up for the job I guess"
50:53;50:58;"And so my years of sort of trying to figure out who I was"
50:58;50:59;"They're a little blurry"
50:59;51:03;"We liked Steely Dan, we liked Asia and Gaucho"
51:03;51:05;"And the records, oh the Pretzelogic records"
51:05;51:09;"And Don't Take Me Alive and what is that, Royal Scam?"
51:09;51:11;"And because that was just sort of a little step"
51:11;51:16;"That had sort of a couple of toes in the jazz world, sort of"
51:16;51:17;"Yeah, no, no"
51:17;51:18;"Harmonic, a chordal level"
51:18;51:20;"So that's where we were"
51:20;51:24;"We also liked Mike McDonald who, I'm sure you know"
51:24;51:26;"Because you seem to be a bit of a historian"
51:26;51:28;"He was in Steely Dan"
51:28;51:33;"So his songs with the Doobie Brothers were a little more jazzy"
51:33;51:34;"A little more R&B"
51:34;51:36;"And we really, or I really loved him"
51:36;51:39;"I mentioned that we were discovered"
51:39;51:41;"Well, we were discovered by him, okay"
51:41;51:43;"In a bar in Hampton, Virginia"
51:43;51:45;"And he tried to help us out"
51:45;51:49;"And I guess you could say that we sounded a little bit like"
51:49;51:54;"Pat Metheny meets Steely Dan meets rock, okay"
51:54;51:59;"So as far as what was considered cool, man"
51:59;52:04;"I think we were way outside that Venn diagram, okay"
52:04;52:05;"We did not intersect"
52:05;52:08;"Because that music that I'm just referring to"
52:08;52:11;"Is not part of that pantheon"
52:11;52:12;"You know what I'm saying?"
52:12;52:14;"It just wasn't then"
52:14;52:17;"It was pop, it was hits top 40"
52:17;52:23;"And so, oh, the people like The Clash and Next Pistols"
52:23;52:25;"And the new Wave acts"
52:25;52:26;"And the cars and all that"
52:26;52:29;"That, I mean, and this is my perception, man"
52:29;52:31;"And frankly, I guess you could ask about me"
52:31;52:33;"What I asked about the Dead"
52:33;52:35;"Did I really give much of a rat's?"
52:35;52:38;"But I think it wasn't me not giving a s***"
52:38;52:42;"It was mostly me not really having a clue about it, okay"
52:42;52:48;"But I knew that I was not your guy to open for the flock of seagulls"
52:48;52:50;"You know, I knew that's not who I was"
52:50;52:53;"There's another main influence of mine"
52:53;52:54;"And that's Joni Mitchell"
52:54;52:58;"Because, again, she was making ""Azura"""
52:58;52:59;"Which I totally love"
52:59;53:01;"And Don Juan's ""Reckless Daughter"""
53:01;53:04;"And before that ""Hissing of Summer Lawns"""
53:04;53:06;"Which really, then ""Cord and Spark"""
53:06;53:08;"Which really started her little dalliance"
53:08;53:10;"With the sort of jazzy chords"
53:10;53:12;"And ""LA Express,"" ""Tom Scott"" and all that"
53:12;53:14;"So I was more into that thing"
53:14;53:18;"Like, for instance, I loved Ricky Lee Jones' second record"
53:18;53:19;"I loved the first one"
53:19;53:21;"But ""Pirates"" to me was just transcended"
53:21;53:22;"And still is"
53:22;53:24;"When we had Justin on the show"
53:24;53:28;"You said that between you and specifically that album, ""Pirates"""
53:28;53:31;"That's basically his whole inspiration"
53:31;53:32;"Me and ""Pirates""?"
53:32;53:32;"Well, that's..."
53:32;53:33;"Yeah"
53:33;53:33;"Woo!"
53:33;53:35;"Man, Justin, thanks"
53:35;53:36;"That's high freaking praise"
53:36;53:38;"Because I can't hang with ""Pirates"""
53:38;53:39;"I'm not..."
53:39;53:41;"That's another level from me"
53:41;53:43;"But thanks to my friend Justin Vernon"
53:43;53:44;"Thanks to him"
53:44;53:47;"So when ""The Way It Is,"" the first album with The Range came out"
53:47;53:50;"Which obviously we know now went on to be a huge success"
53:50;53:51;"Iconic"
53:51;53:54;"You guys won Best New Artist at the Grammys"
53:54;53:58;"Right before that album came out, what were your expectations?"
53:58;53:59;"Oh man"
53:59;54:00;"Was there a lot of rumbling?"
54:00;54:02;"Like, ""Oh man, Bruce Horn's being The Range"
54:02;54:03;"This is the next big thing"""
54:03;54:04;"Not at all"
54:04;54:05;"No, no, no"
54:05;54:06;"I'll give you the true story"
54:06;54:11;"The 30th anniversary of that record occurred in '16"
54:11;54:12;"2016"
54:12;54:13;"So I was asked a lot about this"
54:13;54:16;"And I just told the truth about it"
54:16;54:19;"And the truth is not what people expect"
54:19;54:20;"We were mastering the record"
54:20;54:22;"This is all new to me"
54:22;54:24;"Getting these test pressings and refs"
54:24;54:26;"And my wife comes home from..."
54:26;54:28;"She taught school in the Valley"
54:28;54:30;"We live in Van Nuys"
54:30;54:30;"Nice"
54:30;54:31;"The lights are off"
54:31;54:35;"I'm sitting on the couch in sort of a dark room"
54:35;54:38;"And it's the evening with this morose vibe"
54:39;54:42;"I'm sitting in between our two JBL speakers"
54:42;54:44;"And she says, ""What's going on?"""
54:44;54:47;"""I hate my record"""
54:47;54:47;"""That I..."""
54:47;54:48;"""Okay"""
54:48;54:49;"And I did"
54:49;54:52;"And to be honest, I know this sounds ridiculous"
54:52;54:53;"But I still kind of do"
54:53;54:56;"There was so much about it that I thought"
54:56;54:58;"Could have been so much better than what it is"
54:58;55:00;"I'm just being honest"
55:00;55:01;"I know it sounds goofy"
55:01;55:01;"I'm a..."
55:01;55:03;"Whatever it sounds like"
55:03;55:05;"That's just the truth of the matter"
55:05;55:07;"What are the things you wanted to change?"
55:07;55:08;"Was it like a mixing thing?"
55:08;55:11;"To be honest, I'm not a big fan of that singer"
55:11;55:12;"On those early records"
55:12;55:14;"Just hard to listen to your own voice"
55:14;55:15;"Yeah, I'm just not"
55:15;55:17;"I just think it's a little wooden and a little straight"
55:17;55:19;"And it's not good"
55:19;55:20;"Not it"
55:20;55:20;"And so..."
55:20;55:26;"So did you feel that way when you were listening to the ref of Mansard Roof?"
55:26;55:33;"I would say that the earlier one of our records"
55:33;55:35;"Like the earlier the record is"
55:35;55:38;"The more likely if I happen to hear it somewhere, I cringe"
55:38;55:39;"But even now I don't"
55:39;55:41;"I hate listening back to vocal stuff"
55:41;55:43;"And it really slows down the process"
55:43;55:45;"Because I love living in the world"
55:45;55:49;"When all that exists is a little instrumental demo"
55:49;55:51;"And I don't have to listen to my vocals yet"
55:51;55:52;"And you know, you got to rip the band-aid off"
55:52;55:54;"But I can 100% relate to it"
55:54;55:57;"I saw this on Wikipedia"
55:57;55:59;"So I don't know if it's totally legit"
55:59;56:00;"But it said that..."
56:00;56:01;"Yeah, I can't believe that one"
56:01;56:02;"Yeah, I know this"
56:02;56:03;"So you got to tell us"
56:03;56:05;"It says that the album was originally targeted"
56:05;56:07;"At the new age music market"
56:07;56:10;"And it had slightly different versions of songs"
56:10;56:10;"Is that true?"
56:10;56:13;"That's completely untrue"
56:13;56:14;"Untrue"
56:14;56:15;"My Wikipedia page says that"
56:15;56:17;"The album Wikipedia page"
56:17;56:19;"It says there were slightly different versions of Down the Road Tonight"
56:19;56:20;"And The River Runs Low"
56:20;56:23;"And it says it implies that they were new age-ier"
56:23;56:25;"No, that's just somebody guessing"
56:25;56:26;"Here's the deal with that"
56:26;56:27;"Here's the..."
56:27;56:30;"Those three songs were produced by Huey Lewis"
56:30;56:30;"Those are two of the three"
56:30;56:33;"Before I had learned to say no"
56:33;56:35;"You know, learned to say put my foot down"
56:35;56:37;"And be assertive when I thought something was not right"
56:37;56:39;"And he was my good friend"
56:39;56:40;"He's still my good friend"
56:40;56:41;"But I didn't like the versions"
56:41;56:43;"And so I went back in"
56:43;56:45;"And stripped everything off River Runs Low"
56:45;56:47;"And turned it into a keyboard vocal"
56:47;56:49;"So the second pressing"
56:49;56:50;"And you know, luckily for me"
56:50;56:52;"There were several pressings of that record"
56:52;56:54;"And so only the first whatever hundred"
56:54;56:56;"Had the one that I wasn't too fond of"
56:56;56:58;"And same with Down the Road"
56:58;57:00;"And so, yeah, that's so funny"
57:00;57:01;"That someone's just guessing that"
57:01;57:04;"And that they couldn't be more wrong"
57:04;57:05;"That's the reason"
57:05;57:07;"I wonder with the new age thing"
57:07;57:09;"So I see that maybe with different pressings"
57:09;57:11;"There were different album covers"
57:11;57:14;"The original one that doesn't have you guys on it"
57:14;57:15;"I guess I can see that"
57:15;57:18;"That has that kind of vibe-y abstract painting"
57:18;57:19;"I'm not sure what it is"
57:19;57:22;"I guess that maybe reads a little new age-y"
57:22;57:23;"Maybe that's what they meant"
57:23;57:24;"Well, no, here's how that happened"
57:24;57:25;"That's so funny revisiting this"
57:25;57:27;"I haven't thought about this sort of stuff for years"
57:27;57:28;"But yeah, okay"
57:28;57:30;"So it was the Blurry Accordion Man"
57:30;57:31;"That was the first cover"
57:31;57:34;"The record was released in America first"
57:34;57:36;"And then about three or four months later"
57:36;57:38;"It's being released in Europe and in England"
57:38;57:41;"And the Europeans came to the American label and said"
57:41;57:43;"We think this record's okay"
57:43;57:46;"But the cover just does not speak to us at all"
57:46;57:47;"It feels a little country"
57:47;57:49;"So can you come up with another cover?"
57:49;57:50;"So we came up with that cover"
57:50;57:53;"Which was really the inside sleeve picture of the band"
57:53;57:56;"As the cover with the picture of the truck"
57:56;57:59;"Rolling across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge tunnel"
57:59;58:01;"That became the background of the cover"
58:01;58:04;"So that's the reason for that"
58:04;58:06;"But speaking of new age now"
58:06;58:09;"It's funny to note the demo tape that got me signed"
58:09;58:12;"I got two offers"
58:12;58:13;"One from RCA and one from Epic"
58:13;58:14;"And that was it"
58:14;58:16;"I picked RCA and that was it"
58:16;58:20;"But before that I had made this tape very quietly"
58:20;58:21;"Just by myself"
58:21;58:23;"Just me and a Linn Drum machine"
58:23;58:26;"And playing synth bass on an Oberheim OBX"
58:26;58:28;"And piano and vocal"
58:28;58:32;"And I knew this woman who worked for Wyndham Hill"
58:32;58:35;"The quintessential, the archetypal new age label"
58:35;58:37;"Or George Winston's label"
58:37;58:39;"And I thought maybe they might be interested in it"
58:39;58:42;"Because I thought no major label would have any interest in this music"
58:42;58:45;"So I sent this to her"
58:45;58:46;"I sent two songs to her"
58:46;58:48;"The way it is in Mandolin Rain"
58:48;58:51;"And she said, ""Well, Will Ackerman, the head of the label"
58:51;58:52;"He loves this"
58:52;58:52;"Can we hear a couple more?"""
58:52;58:54;"I said, ""Well, I'm doing a session this week"""
58:54;58:57;"So she came down, took a tape from there"
58:57;58:58;"Gave it to Will"
58:58;59:00;"And Will Ackerman called me on a Sunday night"
59:00;59:01;"I'll never forget it"
59:01;59:03;"Because I'd been trying to get something going for many years"
59:03;59:05;"And all of a sudden this was so easy"
59:05;59:07;"He called and said, ""Okay, we want you"""
59:07;59:09;"So we went from there"
59:09;59:10;"And a couple of labels heard about it"
59:10;59:12;"And got in the picture"
59:12;59:14;"And I didn't go to Wyndham Hill"
59:14;59:16;"But I would have been just satisfied"
59:16;59:20;"I don't think my music, that music sounded like new age music"
59:20;59:22;"But they were starting a vocal label"
59:22;59:26;"And so this was going to be on the Wyndham Hill, I guess, pop label"
59:26;59:30;"But no, there was never that thing that you read"
59:30;59:32;"Yeah, that's just a complete load"
59:32;59:34;"We got to get that changed"
59:34;59:39;"For what it's worth, there's no footnote on that part of the Wikipedia page"
59:39;59:42;"Oh, so it should be very easy to get it taken off"
59:42;59:44;"Will, I'll leave that to Jake Longstrap"
59:44;59:50;"Jake said his Wikipedia page vandalized himself"
59:50;59:54;"So he's very familiar with the feeling of something untrue being up there"
59:54;59:54;"Oh yeah"
59:55;01:00:00;"The song came and went like the times that we spent"
01:00:00;01:00:07;"Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent"
01:00:07;01:00:15;"Laughed and she'd smile, it would last for a while"
01:00:15;01:00:20;"You don't know what you got 'til you lose it all again"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"Listen to the band you're in"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Listen to the music on the play"
01:00:27;01:00:31;"Oh, listen to my heartbreak"
01:00:31;01:00:34;"Every time she runs away"
01:00:34;01:00:38;"Oh, listen to the band you're in"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"My sad song, I'm drifting along"
01:00:41;01:00:45;"Listen to the tears rolling"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Down my face as she turns to go"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"When did you start playing with The Grateful Dead?"
01:00:50;01:00:55;"And how did that happen given that you must have been incredibly busy just with your own stuff?"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"Well, right, I was pretty bad at being a pop star in those early days"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"I was a little laughable"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Because for one thing, I was 31 years old"
01:01:03;01:01:08;"It's a little bit like Justin really or like Mark Knopper, people who get a later start"
01:01:08;01:01:15;"So at that time, I'm being sent around to these, you know, say the Q104 star party in Cleveland"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"You know, WMMS, whatever it is"
01:01:17;01:01:21;"And I'm sitting there at a table signing autographs for little children"
01:01:21;01:01:25;"On one side of me is Tiffany and the other side is Debbie"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"And it's like, man, what is wrong with this picture?"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"It's me, I'm what's wrong with the picture, wasn't it?"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"So it was a little clownish to me"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"I just, that meant, what have I gotten into?"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"This is not what I want"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"This is not what I was aiming for here, you know?"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"I'm like Ornette Coleman, you know, what happened here?"
01:01:45;01:01:49;"So the first record went pretty far pretty fast"
01:01:49;01:01:55;"And so we had to learn how to become headliners on nine songs that comprised our first record"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"So we're fleshing it out"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"We played two covers"
01:01:58;01:02:02;"One of them was the band's version of ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"""
01:02:02;01:02:04;"""Oh, the streets of Rome"""
01:02:04;01:02:05;"You know, the ""Levant"""
01:02:05;01:02:07;"""Are filled with rubble"""
01:02:07;01:02:11;"You know, that's a great version with Garth's great accordion"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"And I would play accordion on it"
01:02:12;01:02:16;"And then we would take my song, the last song on that"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Waiters record called ""The Red Plains"""
01:02:18;01:02:24;"We would take that into sort of a spacey segue jam into ""I Know Your Rider"""
01:02:24;01:02:25;"So that's what we were doing"
01:02:25;01:02:28;"We were playing those 11 songs every night"
01:02:28;01:02:34;"And so then all of a sudden we got a call out of the blue in February of '87"
01:02:34;01:02:38;"From the Grateful Dead asking if we would open shows"
01:02:38;01:02:43;"""Rike Hooter"" and ""Us and the Dead"" two days at Laguna Seca Racetrack in Monterey"
01:02:43;01:02:48;"So of course, you know, I'd been the Bender Rhodes player in the Octane Kids"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"Hell yeah, I'm saying yes to that"
01:02:49;01:02:53;"So we'd had a great group of people that we'd opened for that year"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"We first guy we opened for was Steve Wynwood"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"And then Huey Lewis, then John Fogarty, then the Eurythmics"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"And then, yeah, it was fantastic"
01:03:02;01:03:05;"We played the Rike stock with the Eurythmics"
01:03:05;01:03:09;"And afterwards I got on the phone from different hotel rooms with Annie Lennox"
01:03:09;01:03:13;"And we just talked for an hour, you know, just beautiful memory"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"That was just incredible"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"So right, we did two days with the Dead then"
01:03:18;01:03:23;"I remember very well where I was playing and saw Phil Lesch on the side of the stage"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"So I was doing a piano intro to some song and I saw Phil there"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"And I knew he liked bitonality"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"So I decided to go into this thing"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"A bitonal version of Scott Joplin's The Entertainer, you know"
01:03:35;01:03:40;"But one hand in C and one hand in C sharp"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"So it's just hateful to most ears"
01:03:43;01:03:50;"It just lifted and it was just another just great memory to see Phil all of a sudden rear back"
01:03:50;01:03:56;"And just short all the way to Glee as I'm just inflicting this bitonal pain on the poor"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Unsuspecting deadheads, you know"
01:03:59;01:04:04;"So then the next year, '88, they asked us to open a couple more shows"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"We played Buck I Like and this time they asked me to sit in with them"
01:04:07;01:04:12;"I played Sugary and Stuck Inside a Mobile on accordion with them"
01:04:12;01:04:17;"And Jerry gets on the mic and says, ""We don't let just anybody sit on accordion with us"""
01:04:17;01:04:20;"You know, just those memories that you will just not forget"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"You know, it was just amazingly beautiful"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"And then we played Rainforest Benefit at Madison Square Garden, Susanne Vega"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"and Holland Oates"
01:04:30;01:04:34;"And then the next year they asked us to open some more '89, three more shows"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"RFK, the late great JFK in Philly"
01:04:38;01:04:42;"And so I would sit with him all the time at that point"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"Then I got so I would sit"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"I just come in when they were geographically close to me and sit in with them"
01:04:47;01:04:51;"Say at the Forum in LA and Garcia then played on our third record"
01:04:51;01:04:55;"It just was this growing relationship, especially between Jerry and me"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"That just kept on going on and going on"
01:04:58;01:05:02;"Jerry played on our third record and then he came down and did this taped concert"
01:05:02;01:05:08;"And then Brent died and I was walking down the street early in the morning in Seattle"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"I've just gotten a call telling me this"
01:05:10;01:05:15;"And not an hour later at six in the morning I'm walking down the street"
01:05:15;01:05:19;"And somebody comes up to me and said, ""Hey Bruce, are you gonna join the Dead?"""
01:05:19;01:05:20;"I mean, it was already out"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"It was unbelievable, the rapid"
01:05:23;01:05:26;"The Deadhead on the street just saw you and was like"
01:05:26;01:05:26;"Yes"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Right"
01:05:27;01:05:32;"And sure enough, a few nights later, Garcia and Phil came out to Conker Pavilion"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Where we were playing and asked me to join the band"
01:05:34;01:05:40;"And so I said, ""Look, if you'd have found me four years ago, five years ago"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"I would have absolutely said yes"
01:05:42;01:05:47;"You know, I love you guys and I'll help you through any tough time you have here"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"But I got this other thing going fairly solidly now"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"But I will help you"""
01:05:51;01:05:55;"And so then they took me up on that and I played with them for the next 20 months"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"And then so after that, you would just kind of come in and out for when you were close"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"And that's exactly right"
01:06:01;01:06:05;"At the end though, when he was really, he was really struggling"
01:06:05;01:06:11;"The year '95, they actually, someone who wouldn't know sort of the inside dope about it"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"Would just all of a sudden see me show up in Charlotte"
01:06:14;01:06:20;"And then see me show up in, at RFK for the last two nights in June"
01:06:20;01:06:24;"And that was because they would call me when I was geographically close"
01:06:24;01:06:28;"And they either, they'd fly me up or down and rent a piano"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"To ask me to play because they thought it would pick Jerry up"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"So that was really sad"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"But I, look, I remember those gigs fondly"
01:06:35;01:06:41;"And I had a great time doing those last three 1995 shows right near the end"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"And yeah, I talked to Garcia four days before he died"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Wow, heavy"
01:06:45;01:06:48;"I called him to check on him after the tour was over"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"And Steve Parrish answered"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"You know who Steve is?"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Oh yeah"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Big Steve"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Part of the crew"
01:06:54;01:06:59;"His guy, his manager, his minder, long time, right hand man to Garcia"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"And he answers the phone at Jerry's house"
01:07:02;01:07:05;"And he says, ""Well, hey man, we're getting ready to take Jerry"""
01:07:05;01:07:10;"As you probably know that we're getting ready to take Jerry to Betty Ford"
01:07:10;01:07:10;"And here he is"
01:07:10;01:07:16;"So he got on the phone and said, ""Yeah, okay, I'm gonna be there for a month or five weeks"""
01:07:16;01:07:17;"""And hoping for the best"""
01:07:17;01:07:18;"He seemed in good spirits"
01:07:18;01:07:22;"And so, okay, we had a nice talk about it"
01:07:22;01:07:28;"And then about two weeks later, I decided to just call and check in and see if anyone answered"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Get a little progress report on him"
01:07:29;01:07:35;"And he answered saying, ""I think I'm good"""
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Two weeks was enough"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"And he proceeded to tell me all about the people he'd met"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"This young kid who was a big Django Reinhardt fanatic"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"And so how he bonded with this guy and this other guy"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"He was sounded in good spirits"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"And we were talking about things we were going to do"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"He knew that I was at the time going to work with Ornette"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"Ornette had called me about doing something"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"And I think he'd called Jerry about the same thing"
01:07:59;01:08:04;"So we were making some fun plans about the fall as far as doing some things"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"Even though I wasn't playing with the band anymore"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"And then four days later, he was gone"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"Miss him a lot even now, totally"
01:08:11;01:08:18;"It's hard to think of too many other just like absolute shredder iconic musicians"
01:08:18;01:08:22;"Who also, obviously we didn't know him personally like you"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"But also who radiates such warmth"
01:08:24;01:08:28;"It seems like that combination is such a huge part of the Grateful Dead's appeal"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Even just like his smile"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"The fact that there could be somebody playing like that"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"But it's couched in kind of happiness and warmth"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"It's a combo you don't always get with amazing musicians"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Well, now let's be honest, he was a snarky guy too"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"But always not in a nasty way"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"He was just..."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"Playful?"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Yeah, playful"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"He was a very warm guy"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Just ready to f*** with somebody"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"But again, joyfully, just in jest"
01:08:51;01:08:52;"It was always funny"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Yeah, he turned me on to the Jerky Boys in his tent"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"Get out of here"
01:08:57;01:08:57;"Yeah, oh yeah"
01:08:57;01:09:01;"He was just like, ""Bruce, you gotta hear this, these guys are hilarious"""
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Yes, exactly right"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"Wow"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"We used to listen to Henny Youngman tapes in that tent"
01:09:05;01:09:09;"He loved the old Borscht Belt, Catskills comedy"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"And so did and do I"
01:09:11;01:09:14;"So look, I could go on about this"
01:09:14;01:09:18;"But there's lots of people who have their Garcia memoirs"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"And I'll just be another guy doing it"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"But I have my own versions of it"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"I used to phone prank him, which was great fun sometimes"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"Oh, you pulled Jerky Boys on him?"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Well, that sort of thing, yeah"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"That type of thing, yeah"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"Until I couldn't get him anymore"
01:09:29;01:09:35;"What was your go-to prank call, like, shtick?"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"Okay, back in that day"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"You may or may not have heard of this"
01:09:38;01:09:42;"Hopefully you came after that day was over"
01:09:42;01:09:46;"But that was an era where the beginning of a session"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"Of a record being made was all about the poor bastard"
01:09:50;01:09:54;"The poor drummer with 20 different snare drums"
01:09:54;01:09:58;"And that they're in the control room as he's playing each snare drum"
01:09:58;01:10:02;"To get a sound and to try to find the exact perfect snare sound"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"For the project or for a particular song"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"I can picture it, sure"
01:10:06;01:10:10;"So our guy Molo, John Molo, while he's in there"
01:10:10;01:10:14;"Just getting flogged by whoever reducer is in there"
01:10:14;01:10:19;"We're in the little lounge with lots of time on our hands"
01:10:19;01:10:23;"So we used to phone prank people and try to interest them"
01:10:23;01:10:26;"In buying our product, wireless drum pads, okay"
01:10:26;01:10:32;"Which is a complete joke, it's a complete load"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"Yeah, you got the wireless drum pads"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"But what are you going to do with them?"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"You have to move them"
01:10:36;01:10:40;"You can't strap drum pads on your body and run around with them"
01:10:40;01:10:45;"Anyway, Garcia, we had this goofy thing we would do"
01:10:45;01:10:49;"With friends of ours who were not working at the time"
01:10:49;01:10:50;"Maybe this is a little cruel"
01:10:50;01:10:51;"But of course we'd always let them in later"
01:10:51;01:10:54;"I would call them as the lawyer"
01:10:54;01:10:58;"The Irish-Jewish lawyer Mel Oberg"
01:10:58;01:11:02;"And we're trying to hire you for our band"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"The super group, the Jefferson Stocky"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Grace Slick and Rico Starr"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"We're going to do the Colors Medley"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"White Rabbit into Yellow Submarine"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"It's going to be huge, kid"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"And we're paying five grand a week"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"And a thousand bucks a day per day"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"You know, just astronomical fees"
01:11:19;01:11:22;"And lining these guys up"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"So I called up Garcia one time with the same Mel Oberg schtick"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"But this time I said, we're starting this super group"
01:11:28;01:11:32;"The Jefferson Starcia"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"And he's just really befuddled by this"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"This really threw him"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"But he actually took it seriously?"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"He was just like, really?"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"Grace and Ringo are in for it?"
01:11:46;01:11:46;"Okay"
01:11:46;01:11:51;"So that was..."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"I'm sorry, it's a little pitiful"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"I'm laughing at my own jokes here"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"But it was quite..."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Did you ever tape your calls?"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"We have several of these"
01:12:00;01:12:00;"Oh my god, I mean"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Yeah, we don't have..."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Is it going to get an official release?"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"Yeah, well, we don't have the Jefferson Starcia ones"
01:12:05;01:12:08;"But it's possible that there's a tape somewhere of you pranking Jerry?"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"No, unfortunately there's not"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Because that was..."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"Music people"
01:12:12;01:12:19;"Yeah, mostly these were having before we knew any sort of big time celeb music people"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"You know, the first record was the record where we're just listening to the guy"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"And he's making Molo play"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"Hey, put this other..."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"He had another snare drum, you know, so"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"But I really got him one time when I was..."
01:12:31;01:12:36;"Okay, we used to love these bootleg tapes of the great New Orleans disc jockey"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"And former one-hit wonder Ernie Kado"
01:12:38;01:12:39;"You ever heard of him?"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"No, not familiar"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"She's the meanest woman I know"
01:12:43;01:12:47;"Mother-in-law, mother-in-law"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"You guys know that"
01:12:49;01:12:53;"Yeah, that was Ernie Kado's big one"
01:12:53;01:12:59;"He had this great show on WWZ, 90.7 on your radio dial"
01:12:59;01:13:03;"It's Ernie K-D-O-E, I'm the baddest motor scooter ever hit New Orleans"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"On and on"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"He was just fantastic"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"We loved him, we collected him"
01:13:07;01:13:12;"So I called up Garcia one time as Ernie Kado"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"And it was around Christmas time and I said"
01:13:13;01:13:18;"Jerry, I said, ""This is Ernie Kado, live on New Orleans radio"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"What you got to say to New Orleans, Jerry Garcia?"""
01:13:20;01:13:23;"""Oh, well, hey Ernie, well, yeah, okay, well, all right"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"I'd like to say happy holidays, merry Christmas, happy holidays to everybody"""
01:13:27;01:13:29;"And I went, ""Oh my God, I've got him"""
01:13:29;01:13:30;"So I just kept winding him up"
01:13:30;01:13:34;"Went Grateful Dead, go play New Orleans, Jerry Garcia"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"I just called him by his full name every time"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"And went Grateful Dead, go play mother-in-law"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"You know, ""Oh, we like that, yeah, okay, well"""
01:13:39;01:13:43;"So finally I said, ""Hey man, it's Orange B"""
01:13:43;01:13:45;"And he said, ""You weasel"""
01:13:45;01:13:48;"And that was it"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"He really thought he was live on the radio"
01:13:49;01:13:55;"He really thought he was live on WWZ with the man himself"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"I love that, just straight up asking"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Like, ""When's the Grateful Dead gonna cover my song?"""
01:13:58;01:13:59;"Just trying to be diplomatic"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"""Well, you know, man, it's a good song"""
01:14:01;01:14:04;"It's such a bygone era"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"Because I'm just thinking now"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Like, I loved doing prank calls too when I was growing up"
01:14:08;01:14:12;"And just think like now, nobody picks up"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"I would never pick up a call that if I didn't recognize the number"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"And if I picked up and somebody was like, ""Hey, you're live on the radio"""
01:14:17;01:14:19;"I'd just like immediately hang up"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"But back then, people got calls all the time"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"You had to kind of roll with it"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"Yeah, they were kind of ready to buy it more"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Yeah, so that's right"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"But you can still do it with Star 67 now"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"And you mostly have to call people you kind of know"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"But not know well enough that they would get your voice"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"If you're disguising it with, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
01:14:38;01:14:38;"You know?"
01:14:38;01:14:39;"Right"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"That's my Garcia rap"

01:15:48;01:15:53;"in the post-Jerry era, notably the huge Fair Thee Well shows"
01:15:53;01:15:57;"And I guess you always, every year or two, you're always playing with"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"some combination of dead guys"
01:15:59;01:16:02;"You're still very, you've been in that orbit ever since, right?"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Not really anymore, not for a while"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Right away, Jerry died in '95"
01:16:06;01:16:10;"And the next year, we did the Further Festival"
01:16:10;01:16:14;"And so it was Mickey's band and Bobby's band and my band"
01:16:14;01:16:18;"and Los Lobos was on it, which was great"
01:16:18;01:16:22;"And then we also did '97, the Black Crows came on with us then"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"And same other bands, Mickey, Bobby, and I was doing it"
01:16:25;01:16:29;"And then '98, though, Phil got interested in doing it"
01:16:29;01:16:33;"Phil came out and sat in with us at Shoreline Amphitheater in '97"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"The last gig of the '97 Further run"
01:16:36;01:16:41;"And so we did with Phil and Molo, my drummer, I got him into the thing"
01:16:41;01:16:47;"And that catapulted him into a great place of prominence in that world"
01:16:47;01:16:51;"For a long time, he still plays with Phil, it's fantastic"
01:16:51;01:16:52;"He's fantastic in that"
01:16:52;01:16:56;"And so we had to group the other ones, do you know about that?"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"Yeah, yeah"
01:16:57;01:17:00;"We started playing, we played one night in Atlanta, the other ones"
01:17:00;01:17:04;"And we played for about maybe 8,000 people"
01:17:04;01:17:09;"And then the next night, we played in Charlotte for about 11,000 people"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"But we played St. Stephen that night"
01:17:12;01:17:15;"And then the next night in Vienna, Virginia, there were 18,000 people"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"And the rest of the tour was just sold out"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"So that was fun, but we didn't do that again"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"Well, then they became The Dead in the early 2000s"
01:17:23;01:17:27;"And Phil asked me to do it, but I just thought I just wanted to"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"concentrate on what I was doing"
01:17:30;01:17:34;"And so I really felt I'd done what I was supposed to do there"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"And I pretty much stepped away from it"
01:17:36;01:17:43;"We would play some gigs with Bobby now and then in the mid to late aughts with Rat Dog"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"We'd open for them sometimes and that was always fun"
01:17:46;01:17:50;"Bobby and I actually did a couple of duo shows in the early teens"
01:17:50;01:17:55;"We did two in Paramount Theater, I think in Oakland"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"We were talking about doing a whole tour, but he, I don't know"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"Seemed to get in a little trouble with something then"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"Something was bugging him then, so he ended up canceling it"
01:18:04;01:18:09;"But since then, I think, and I think it's right"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Jeff Comente is a fantastic musician"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"He's just the man for the job, you know"
01:18:13;01:18:18;"Anyway, so I'm really happy doing exactly what I'm doing"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"I got really busy with Spike Lee in those years too, the teens"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"Right, I was going to ask you about that"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"So you have a long-time relationship with him"
01:18:24;01:18:28;"You've been contributing music to his stuff since the mid-90s, right?"
01:18:28;01:18:33;"Man, you really know my history"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Thanks for being so interested"
01:18:35;01:18:41;"I will turn it back on you though and tell you that your song ""Cousins"" just kills me"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Oh yeah"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"I love the video"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Oh, thank you"
01:18:45;01:18:49;"And I love just breakneck strumming you're doing on that"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"It's just crazy"
01:18:52;01:18:56;"And I love how some people jump out front and another guy jumps out front"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"And yeah, it's just great"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"Oh, thank you"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"That might be our highest energy song"
01:19:00;01:19:05;"It really is, although there's another one that you have that's just, oh, ""Worship You"""
01:19:05;01:19:10;"The rapid-fire words, man, it's amazing"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"We didn't even try to do that live for years"
01:19:13;01:19:14;"And then finally I was like, you know what?"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"I can do this"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"And now we do it live and it's a great moment"
01:19:17;01:19:20;"Well, I'd like to hear it because it's totally impressive"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"And just, I love it"
01:19:21;01:19:24;"Yeah, so I could turn all this back on you"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"But I'll just do those two"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"No, that's very cool, man"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"I appreciate it"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"Well, tell us a little bit about the new album, by the way"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"Love the first single with James Mercer"
01:19:34;01:19:34;"Oh yeah"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"Oh, I was going to tell you about Spike, but I'll go on to this"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Oh yeah, talk about Spike first"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"So how'd you guys make up?"
01:19:40;01:19:44;"Okay, we met through our great mutual friend, Branford"
01:19:44;01:19:47;"And Branford said to Spike, ""Hey, you want to meet Bruce?"""
01:19:47;01:19:49;"And he said to me, ""Do you want to meet Spike?"""
01:19:49;01:19:50;"And we both said yes"
01:19:50;01:19:50;"And so we did"
01:19:50;01:19:56;"And I asked him to make a video for me for a song off my fourth record, ""Harbor Lights"""
01:19:56;01:19:57;"That Branford was playing on called ""Talk of the Town"""
01:19:57;01:20:00;"A song about the first interracial romance in my town here"
01:20:00;01:20:06;"And all the consternation it caused among the old, crusty old conservative geeks"
01:20:06;01:20:13;"But then we really started doing more when he asked me in '95 to contribute the end title song"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"To his movie at the time, ""Clockers"""
01:20:15;01:20:17;"It's a great movie, Delroy Lindo"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"It's amazing, as it always is"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"A high five for his first film"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"And so it happened that Chaka Khan had called me"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"And asked me to write a song with her"
01:20:26;01:20:31;"And so she was down here in my studio where I am right now working"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"And I said, ""Hey, I'm writing a song with Chaka"""
01:20:33;01:20:34;"He said, ""Well, give it to me"""
01:20:34;01:20:37;"So when we finished with it, we gave it to Spike"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"And it was the end title song"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"That's called ""Love Me Still"""
01:20:39;01:20:41;"And it's had a nice life"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"For instance, when I sit in with the Roots, Jimmy Fallon group"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"They always say, ""Okay, we gotta play 'Love Me Still'"""
01:20:47;01:20:48;"That's our song"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"So great fun there"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"So that just kept on going"
01:20:51;01:20:54;"But it moved into high gear in 2008"
01:20:54;01:20:59;"When he asked me to score an ESPN documentary"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"He was making on the late, great Kobe Bryant"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"""Kobe Doing Work"""
01:21:03;01:21:05;"So I think it was sort of an audition for me"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"I think he was just testing to see if I could do this"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"So I did this and he liked it"
01:21:10;01:21:13;"And he kept hiring me for the next 10 years"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"To do a bunch of projects"
01:21:14;01:21:18;"Mostly his sort of mid- to B-level stuff"
01:21:18;01:21:21;"Terrence is his guy for all the A-team stuff"
01:21:21;01:21:24;"I contributed a little incidental music to ""Black Klansman"""
01:21:24;01:21:26;"I think he just threw me a bone there"
01:21:26;01:21:31;"But he's hired me for a bunch of, like I say, mid-level"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"Seriously, indie projects"
01:21:34;01:21:39;"Such films as ""Red Hook Summer"" and ""The Sweet Blood of Jesus"""
01:21:39;01:21:43;"NBA 2K16, things like that"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"And so I wrote all this music"
01:21:46;01:21:51;"And it segues into your next question about this new business I'm dealing with"
01:21:51;01:21:57;"Because I wrote from 2008 till last year, 2019"
01:21:57;01:22:04;"And in that time, I've probably written almost 240 different pieces of music for him"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"- Wow"
01:22:05;01:22:09;"- Say 40 per project, and there were probably about six of them"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"He's probably used about half of them"
01:22:12;01:22:18;"But through that time of amassing all this material, I would often think,"
01:22:18;01:22:21;"""Well, this song, this instrumental cue needs to become a song"""
01:22:21;01:22:24;"It just has too much of a vibe in it"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"And I needed to do that"
01:22:26;01:22:30;"So a couple years ago, I started ""Down the Road"""
01:22:30;01:22:33;"The first time I'd ever tried writing songs this way"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"Had all this lyrical content that I'd accumulated through the reading I do"
01:22:38;01:22:44;"And great writers, Don DeLillo, David Foster Wallace, on and on"
01:22:44;01:22:48;"So I tried to meld these ideas that I was getting from this reading"
01:22:48;01:22:52;"With the music, and that became ""Absolute Zero"""
01:22:52;01:22:55;"So it's a very different type of record because of the process"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"The process was very different"
01:22:57;01:23:03;"And so consequently, I think the record feels cinematic for obvious reason, you know"
01:23:03;01:23:07;"Because the music was written with that feeling in mind"
01:23:07;01:23:13;"And so this new thing, ""Non-Secure Connection"" is, I guess it's sort of a sequel"
01:23:13;01:23:17;"It's not really like the last record, but it comes from the same place"
01:23:17;01:23:22;"But as on ""Absolute Zero"", there are several songs that didn't start as cues"
01:23:22;01:23:27;"They're just written like I write a standard song"
01:23:27;01:23:30;"And one of those is the new single you're mentioning, ""My Resolve"""
01:23:30;01:23:34;"I got the great James Mercer, who said to say hello to you"
01:23:34;01:23:39;"Because he said that they did some gigs with you guys about 15 years ago, he said"
01:23:39;01:23:44;"Yeah, you were talking earlier about important, great early memories of opening for people"
01:23:44;01:23:47;"We got to open for The Shins just before our first album came out"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"A few European hits, and it was so exciting for us"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"And I've always been thankful to them for that"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Well, I'll let him know"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"I love what he does, I think he's one of the great songwriters"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"And such a great singer, I always love his voice"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Oh my god, good lord"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"He's like you, he has that high tenor thing"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"He can sing those high, full voice notes, you know"
01:24:06;01:24:11;"And you guys have that, it just pisses the old, old crone here off"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"A little bit, to be honest"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"[Laughter]"
01:24:18;01:24:21;"In electrified skies"
01:24:21;01:24:25;"Incandescent light"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"Born with flash-bold eyes"
01:24:28;01:24:32;"And no one knows why"
01:24:32;01:24:37;"I've been drawn to this life"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"I'm downwind and high"
01:24:40;01:24:45;"On a survival life"
01:24:45;01:24:49;"In my resolve I move the rock"
01:24:49;01:24:52;"Baby fall down trying"
01:24:52;01:24:57;"My ineptitude stares me down"
01:24:57;01:25:00;"In this space I cower"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"I try to stand above the grave"
01:25:04;01:25:08;"Stand apart, not buying"
01:25:08;01:25:12;"And I move on up another hill"
01:25:12;01:25:17;"To maybe fully flower"
01:25:17;01:25:22;"I flower"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"We haven't heard the whole record, obviously"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"But we noticed there's a song"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"And I wonder if this is related to being a film cue"
01:25:29;01:25:33;"Because it has a very interesting name"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"It's called ""Porn Hour"""
01:25:34;01:25:35;"[Laughter]"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I love that you ask about that"
01:25:37;01:25:40;"Okay, ""Porn Hour"" is ""Bleep"" crazy"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"And the title song, ""Non-Secure Connection"""
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Are the three songs in this new record"
01:25:44;01:25:48;"That deal in more advanced, like I say, dissonant"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Chromatic harmony"
01:25:49;01:25:52;"I guess I mean using the black notes and the white notes"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Rather than just the white notes"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"With, you know, most pop music is"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Virtually all of it is white note music"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"And that's a lot of my favorite songs that I've written"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"Are that too"
01:26:02;01:26:06;"But now and then I want to try to push the envelope that way"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"And so ""Porn Hour"""
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Okay, ""Porn Hour"" is a song"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"That I wrote out of an article in the New York Times"
01:26:13;01:26:18;"That posited that early innovation on the internet"
01:26:18;01:26:22;"Should be credited to the porn industry"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"And it makes its case very well, so"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Because porn is such a big part of the internet"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"And probably makes so much money"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"There was people incentivized to figure out"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"How to make the video stream better"
01:26:32;01:26:33;"And how to collect information, all that"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Ezra, you have it exactly right"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"That's exactly it"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"So musically it's"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"Okay, are you familiar with the great French"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Avant-garde composer Olivier Messiaen?"
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"He is well known for"
01:26:46;01:26:49;"Going out in the forest and fields of France"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"With score paper, he had perfect pitch"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"And he would transcribe"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"The ""musique des oiseaux"""
01:26:56;01:26:58;"However you say it"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"And the music of the birds"
01:27:00;01:27:03;"So I've tried my hand at a couple of these pieces"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"I love playing them"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"And I regularly inflict them again"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"On my poor unsuspecting audience that hates it"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"But I wanted to write a song with that language"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"I wish I could play it for you"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"I'm not at a keyboard right now"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"But you'll hear it"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"And you'll know exactly what I mean"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"It starts off, it's very dissonant"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"But it's also kind of fun"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"So I think, hopefully you'll like ""Porn Hour"""
01:27:25;01:27:27;"But if you don't, I get it"
01:27:27;01:27:32;"Well definitely looking forward to hearing it"
01:27:32;01:27:35;"She bought tube socks on Amazon"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"I watched girls remove their bras"
01:27:38;01:27:42;"She wrote a paper on Babylon"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"While she's busy"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Time to toss"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"You know what tossing means, right?"
01:27:47;01:27:47;"Don't you?"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Oh, oh, okay"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"Gutenberg, then Sony 2"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"DVDs, the cloud"
01:27:54;01:27:54;"What's next?"
01:27:54;01:27:58;"Next big thing when this one's through"
01:27:58;01:28:01;"Will be huge if it's got sex"
01:28:01;01:28:06;"We salute the industry of the San Fernando Valley"
01:28:06;01:28:09;"We've got everything we want with a mouse click"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Because of the mighty porn flick"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"And then it goes on from there"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Whoa"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Yeah, there you have it"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Internet's capacity"
01:28:18;01:28:21;"Compounding since it was born"
01:28:21;01:28:25;"Boundless in veracity"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"But in truth it's mostly porn"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"And then back to the chorus"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"We salute the industry of the San Fernando Valley"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"True internet music"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"There you have it, ""Porn Hour"""
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Right to the top of the chart"
01:28:37;01:28:41;"I guess maybe just to finish, just one simple question"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"What is your favorite Grateful Dead song?"
01:28:43;01:28:43;"""Warfrat"""
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Oh, interesting"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"I used to get chills playing it all the time with them"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"It's so simple, but it's so deep"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"It's just like I keep talking about this deep well"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"I love modal music"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"Drone music"
01:28:56;01:28:56;"I love all that"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"And that's what ""Warfrat"" is"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"It's a beautiful composition where it goes through these different sections"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Where the time changes"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"You know, but I'll get back"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"On my feet someday"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"All that"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"It's just as good as it gets for me"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"So ""Warfrat"""
01:29:12;01:29:14;"I know I said that very quickly"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"And I'm sure there are others that are right in there with it"
01:29:17;01:29:21;"But I gotta say that's my number one"
01:29:21;01:29:21;"That's a great song"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"And also I feel like a long time ago"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Jake and I discussed that we both like songs"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Where somebody says, ""My name is..."""
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Just like true storytelling"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"You're the character"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"My name is August West"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"Obviously it comes from like a folk tradition"
01:29:34;01:29:39;"And then what I spent half of my life doing time for some other f***ing crime"
01:29:39;01:29:43;"That's kind of how modern life feels a lot of the time"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"That we're all doing time for somebody else's crime"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"It's hard to put your finger on"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"But it's very moving though, yeah"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"Yeah, it's a beautiful song"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"And by the way, Bruce, Jake is in a Grateful Dead cover"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"I know, yeah"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Richard Pictures"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Yeah, it's a little cryptic"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"We originally were called Dick Pics"
01:30:00;01:30:03;"Okay, I gotcha"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Yep, yeah"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"And then we actually played a few school fundraisers"
01:30:08;01:30:12;"And we changed our name from Dick Pics to Richard Pictures"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"And then it kind of stuck"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"I gotcha"
01:30:15;01:30:15;"Okay"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"Oh, Jake, what's your favorite Dead song?"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"I'd have to say one of those like deep Jerry ballads"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Like, ""Maybe 'Til They Lay Me Down"""
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Mm-hmm"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"""Thumbs of Time"""
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Yeah"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"""Days Between"""
01:30:26;01:30:28;"""Broke Down Palace"""
01:30:28;01:30:31;"I mean, I just think it's so incredible"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"Bruce, did you ever play on a ""Days Between""?"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"Obviously, there's no studio version"
01:30:36;01:30:39;"So, because how many times has that song ever performed?"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"Couldn't have, like..."
01:30:40;01:30:44;"My last tour with them was the March of '92 tour"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"And they had started playing ""Lazy River Road"""
01:30:47;01:30:48;"""So Many Roads"""
01:30:48;01:30:51;"One of Vince's things, ""Long, Long Way to Go Home"""
01:30:51;01:30:53;"And ""Days Between"""
01:30:53;01:30:53;"I'm almost sure"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"So I think I played on among the first"
01:30:56;01:30:59;"I think they played them all without me sometimes"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"When I wasn't there"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"I could have it wrong and maybe I didn't"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"But I do feel like I did that"
01:31:04;01:31:08;"And if not, then maybe some of the times where I would sit in with them"
01:31:08;01:31:11;"After I stopped playing with them mostly full-time"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"I sat in with them one time in Nassau Coliseum"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"One time at Capital Center in DC"
01:31:15;01:31:16;"I thought in Baltimore"
01:31:16;01:31:20;"RFK a couple times in '93 when Sting was opening"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Here's a good story"
01:31:22;01:31:27;"In '93, they were playing RFK and Sting was the opener"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"And my wife and I had twin boys"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"They were one and a half at the time"
01:31:31;01:31:34;"And so we brought them up to the gig"
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Rolling them around the stroller backstage"
01:31:35;01:31:40;"And the first person to see them is Weir"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"And so he goes, ""Oh, all right, the boys"""
01:31:42;01:31:43;"""There they are, here they are"""
01:31:43;01:31:45;"And picks one of them up"
01:31:45;01:31:49;"You know, just as most babies would do"
01:31:49;01:31:53;"As someone, some foreign person puts their hands on them and grabs them"
01:31:53;01:31:54;"They're not psyched, you know"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"So gives them back real fast"
01:31:56;01:32:00;"For years, Don Henley would ask me about playing with the dead"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"I just wasn't sure about it"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"So I said, ""Well, why don't you come to the gig?"""
01:32:02;01:32:04;"So Don Henley came to the gig"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"And so he's backstage"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"So he said, ""Oh, okay, there they are"""
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Picks up on the boys"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"""Yeah, wah!"""
01:32:10;01:32:11;"You know, they just freak out"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"""Okay, back to dad, back to mom"""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"And then Sting comes by"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"""Okay, I love you"""
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Picks up the boys"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"""Wah!"""
01:32:19;01:32:20;"And then we're up on stage"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"And we see Garcia"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"He said, ""Oh, far out, Keith and Russell"""
01:32:23;01:32:24;"Because he knew their names"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"And we hand him one of the babies"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"And they didn't freak out"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"They just grew up with"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"It was just beautiful"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"It was like Santa Claus or something"
01:32:34;01:32:35;"But they were just one and a half"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"So they're still little vegetables then"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"You know, they're just sensing something"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"And they seem like they sense something"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"His frequency, his vibration"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Exactly right"
01:32:45;01:32:45;"That's right"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"That's a beautiful story"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I just, sorry, I just have to ask though"
01:32:49;01:32:50;"Just clarify"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"So Henley wasn't really a fan of the dead"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"So he was kind of asking you"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"What's really up with the dead, man?"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"You were like, come check out the show and you'll see"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Is that the way the exchange went?"
01:33:00;01:33:01;"That's pretty much it"
01:33:01;01:33:04;"A lot of my sort of, I don't know how you describe it"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Mainstream, more mainstream music friends"
01:33:06;01:33:07;"Didn't get the dead"
01:33:07;01:33:07;"I would just say to them"
01:33:07;01:33:10;"Well, one, maybe you have to hear them live"
01:33:10;01:33:13;"And two, you've just got to deal with"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"The amazing quality of some of these songs"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"That's a great way to end"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Thanks so much, Bruce"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"It's been great talking to you"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I hope we get to meet in person one day"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"I know we have also another friend in common"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Or I think you know each other, right?"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Our producer, Ariel Rekshide"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Oh, is that how you say his name?"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Rekshide?"
01:33:31;01:33:34;"Okay, I always say Rekshade"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"So thanks for correcting me"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Yeah, I even thanked him on my record"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"Because he helped me a couple months ago"
01:33:40;01:33:43;"In the throes of the end of the record"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Where I hate everything, you know"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Where you're just cured of every song"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Because you've heard it so much"
01:33:49;01:33:53;"Like the repetition of it just makes you finished with it"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"You've experienced that, right?"
01:33:55;01:33:56;"Absolutely"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Yeah, well, so anyway, I'm at that point"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"And I'm not sure about this song"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"""My Resolve"" the one I did with James"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"So I sent it to him"
01:34:04;01:34:08;"And he just was very effusive"
01:34:08;01:34:09;"And incredibly complimentary"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"And it seemed very legit"
01:34:11;01:34:12;"It seemed sincere"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"But I wasn't sure about the mix"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"And we did a little stuff with the mix"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"And I sent it back to him"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"And he was really nice about it"
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Really complimentary"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"And it really picked me up"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"Because I was in a fairly blue place about things"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Oh no, I screwed this up again"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"You know, so you tell Ariel when you see him"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"That his little emails were a big deal for me"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"And so much so that he's getting a thanks on our record"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"For, you know, that"
01:34:37;01:34:38;"Oh, he'll be psyched"
01:34:38;01:34:38;"He's a huge fan"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"And then also he's definitely a straight shooter, so"
01:34:41;01:34:41;"And I know that"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"And that's what makes it mean more"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"You know, if somebody says everything's great"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"Then you just, it doesn't mean anything"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"But it's so, so that's great"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"Well, okay"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"All right, thanks so much, Bruce"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"Great being with you guys"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"And maybe our band will work up cousins"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"Oh man, that'd be insane"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"All right, have a good one, dude"
01:34:59;01:34:59;"Okay, bye-bye"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Bye-bye"
01:35:02;01:35:14;"Way down, down, down by the docks of the city"
01:35:14;01:35:24;"Blind and dirty"
01:35:30;01:35:36;"Ask me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee"
01:35:36;01:35:40;"You're listening to Time Crisis"
01:35:40;01:35:43;"Well, Bruce Hornsby, absolute legend"
01:35:43;01:35:43;"That was awesome"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"He's kind of a rare figure in the sense that like"
01:35:46;01:35:49;"I mean, he was talking about how he didn't"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"When he became a star, it was such like so awkward"
01:35:53;01:35:56;"Because he's like in his early 30s, first album"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Has this big pop hit with the way it is"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"And it's like he's sitting next to these kind of like"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Teen mall pop icons"
01:36:02;01:36:05;"I can imagine that he felt a little bit between generations"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"A little bit out of place"
01:36:07;01:36:11;"But he really is kind of like sits at the center of a lot of things"
01:36:11;01:36:14;"I mean, just even the fact that in the same year"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"He would have been opening for Eurythmics and The Grateful Dead"
01:36:17;01:36:18;"Yeah"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"And then even the fact that he's like doing music for Spike Lee"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"And being asked to write songs with Don Henley and Chaka Khan"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"He's just like somebody that's just like everybody likes, I find"
01:36:28;01:36:32;"Right, and then famously, The Way It Is was sampled by Tupac"
01:36:32;01:36:38;"Just like another weird kind of avenue of culture that he's touched"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"Yeah, that's just the way it is"
01:36:40;01:36:45;"So Jake, one interesting thing about having Bruce on the show this week"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Is that there's been a buzz in the music community"
01:36:47;01:36:51;"That you've been working on yet another Mountain Bruise EP"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Which this would be the third"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"So do you call it like MB3?"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"Yeah, MB3"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"You've been working on MB3?"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Yeah, we're just in the beginning stages of MB3"
01:37:00;01:37:05;"The concept is because we're not getting together and recording"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"Our rich, organic vocal harmonies or anything"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"So everyone's doing it separately"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"So the idea is we're doing like a"
01:37:13;01:37:17;"The Mountain Bruise characters are now making a record in like the mid-80s"
01:37:17;01:37:22;"Right, as if like the song Mountain Bruise came out in like early 70s"
01:37:22;01:37:22;"Yes"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"The same guys who made that now it's a decade later"
01:37:27;01:37:31;"Exactly, so we're like 70s rocker guys making a record in the mid-80s"
01:37:31;01:37:38;"So yeah, I asked my buddy Ryan who plays keyboards in Richard Pictures and Mountain Bruise"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"And sort of like kind of produced all the Mountain Bruise stuff"
01:37:41;01:37:47;"Write some like Bruce Hornsby style instrumental tracks"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"And send them to me and I'll try to like write songs over them"
01:37:49;01:37:52;"And so just like the other day it was funny"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"We had the Bruce call scheduled"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"Like the other day he sent me an instrumental track"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"And he titled it Raised in a Place"
01:37:58;01:38:02;"Which is like a funny title"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"I was like that's actually a great title"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Because it's a funny riff on like my hometown"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Or like I was born in a small town"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"Or just like Raised in a Place"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"He was just trying to throw some words"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"Just give a name to the file"
01:38:15;01:38:16;"Because obviously it's instrumental"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"But you actually liked it"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"So you wanted to actually try to write a song called Raised in a Place"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Yeah, I thought that was a great idea"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"And then, but I don't have recording set up yet"
01:38:24;01:38:27;"I'm gonna like buy some mics and stuff"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"And like maybe Logic or something"
01:38:28;01:38:33;"So I just like played his instrumental track off my laptop"
01:38:33;01:38:36;"And then recorded the vocals into my voice memos"
01:38:36;01:38:39;"Let's hear a little bit of your voice memo demo"
01:38:39;01:38:42;"The idea is like a Bruce Hornsby demo tape"
01:38:42;01:38:43;"Right"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Like a lost demo tape"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"He was talking about his early demos"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"And Linn drums and synths"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"I'd love to hear that"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"I gotta say Ryan knows his Bruce Hornsby"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"Yes"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"Because this, this is like"
01:38:56;01:38:57;"He nailed it"
01:38:57;01:39:05;"I was raised in a place"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"That's become a disgrace"
01:39:09;01:39:13;"Everything I've ever known"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Is now a disgrace"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"I'm not a disgrace"
01:39:19;01:39:23;"Everything that I once knew"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Now there is no trace"
01:39:25;01:39:31;"The pumpkin patch for the fall harvest"
01:39:31;01:39:35;"Has been paved with a new target"
01:39:35;01:39:39;"They call it progress, but for who?"
01:39:39;01:39:43;"They tell us all, but it's only a few"
01:39:43;01:39:55;"They tore the old buildings down"
01:39:55;01:39:59;"Replaced it all with beige and brown"
01:39:59;01:40:03;"What do I see when I drive around?"
01:40:03;01:40:09;"It's all the same from town to town"
01:40:09;01:40:17;"From town to town"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"And then that riff comes back in"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"That piano riff?"
01:40:21;01:40:21;"Yeah"
01:40:21;01:40:24;"That's a great start"
01:40:24;01:40:25;"My only suggestion"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Take it or leave it"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"I love everything that's there"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"I want to just hear it at some point get big"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"With kind of like, maybe like big harmonies"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"Like 80s gang vocals"
01:40:35;01:40:38;"Like I was raised in a place"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Oh yeah"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Just like a big ""I was raised"""
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Like I love that it starts"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"I love the way you took the line of it"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"""I was raised in a place that's become a disgrace"""
01:40:47;01:40:50;"I just love just the idea of just like shouting"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"""I was raised in a place"""
01:40:51;01:40:53;"That's tight"
01:40:53;01:40:56;"I mean if you want to take a step at the second verse"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"I mean it was sort of a riff"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"I'd love to"
01:40:58;01:40:59;"I was born in a small town"
01:40:59;01:41:02;"So it's like this guy's coming back to his town"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"And it's like my paintings"
01:41:03;01:41:07;"It's all just like the pumpkin patch has been paved"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"It's a target"
01:41:08;01:41:09;"It's a new target"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"And it's all like beige and brown"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"And he's just like bummed on it"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"His small town became like gross and suburban"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"So that's the subject"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"So take a stab at verse two"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"Well and also it's like ""raised in a place"" by itself is like"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"A like you said kind of just like a funny line"
01:41:25;01:41:28;"And then in your first verse you totally explain"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"Well what does that actually mean?"
01:41:29;01:41:30;"""I was raised in a place"""
01:41:30;01:41:32;"You explain what it is about this place in particular"
01:41:32;01:41:35;"But then the way you explain it"
01:41:35;01:41:38;"The anonymity of the phrase ""raised in a place"""
01:41:38;01:41:39;"It's like everybody was raised in a place"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"It's such a weird thing to say"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"But it actually"
01:41:42;01:41:45;"You explain why that you used to be in a place that had"
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Local flavor, character, whatever"
01:41:48;01:41:51;"And now it truly is just a place"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Any town USA"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"It's almost like I was born in a small town"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"And then it became just a place"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"It's nothing"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Just a place"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"That's what drove me crazy about that ""Melon Camp"" song"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"I was like you're born in a small town"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"I take sh*t in a small town"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Whatever he's saying in that song"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"I'm like tell me something about the town man"
01:42:10;01:42:13;"That's not enough information"
01:42:13;01:42:18;"Wait I'm looking at the opening stanza"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Well I was born in a small town"
01:42:20;01:42:21;"And I live in a small town"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"Probably die in a small town"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"Oh those small communities"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"And then"
01:42:26;01:42:26;"What?"
01:42:26;01:42:26;"Wait"
01:42:26;01:42:29;"Oh those small communities"
01:42:29;01:42:30;"All my friends are so small town"
01:42:30;01:42:31;"My parents live in a small town"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"My job is so small town"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"Provides little opportunity"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"All right that's a little bit of commentary"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Okay"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Later he says"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Got nothing against a big town"
01:42:39;01:42:42;"This is almost like Jerry Seinfeld-esque"
01:42:42;01:42:42;"Just like"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"You got big towns?"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"I'm from a small town"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"Now I got nothing against a big town"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"But I'm from a small town"
01:42:50;01:42:53;"I mean we're allowed to clown ""Melon Camp"" a little bit"
01:42:53;01:42:57;"Because he was out there campaigning for Bloomberg"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"Well that ruled"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"And Jake at least gave him a little bit of hell on Twitter"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"I think we talked about this on the show"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"But you treated it ""Melon Camp"""
01:43:04;01:43:05;"I never bought your small town shtick"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"Now he's out there advocating for a billionaire"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Yeah that song ""Small Town"""
01:43:09;01:43:11;"It's like compared to Bruce"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"Or compared to either Bruce"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Springsteen or Hornsby"
01:43:15;01:43:15;"Who like"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"I think also their writing captured the weird moment"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Or their 80s writing at least"
01:43:21;01:43:24;"Captured that weird transitional moment"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"Of like the small towns falling apart"
01:43:27;01:43:27;"And things change"
01:43:27;01:43:31;"Like kind of Ray Guerra buffness"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"I would say the two Bruces really captured that"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"With like sensitivity"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"And the kind of generational thing"
01:43:37;01:43:41;"Anyway in tribute to our illustrious guest Bruce Hornsby"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"For this top five"
01:43:42;01:43:48;"We're just gonna do the top five songs this week in 1986"
01:43:48;01:43:49;"Which apparently is a year we've never done"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"Why 1986?"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"That is when Bruce Hornsby and the Range"
01:43:54;01:43:57;"Dropped their debut record the way it is"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"That's right"
01:43:58;01:44:01;"Also I gotta double check"
01:44:01;01:44:04;"But there's also a Vampire Weekend connection to the Range"
01:44:04;01:44:08;"Because Brian Jones, our illustrious guitarist"
01:44:08;01:44:12;"I think he like studied with John Molo"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"The drummer from the Range"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Maybe at USC or something"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"I gotta ask Brian about that"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"But he has like a real connection to John Molo"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"So Molo teaches at like a college at this point"
01:44:22;01:44:23;"I think so"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Unless it's a story like"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"One of Brian's teachers knew John Molo or something"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"But anyway, yes somehow related to that"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"It's time for the top five"
01:44:33;01:44:36;"On iTunes"
01:44:36;01:44:40;"The number five song this week in 1986"
01:44:40;01:44:43;"From the iconic album Control"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Janet Jackson, ""Nasty"""
01:44:45;01:44:46;"Give me a beat"
01:44:46;01:44:52;"Jake, are you pretty familiar with this album?"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"No, not really"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"I mean"
01:44:55;01:44:56;"Dave is"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Like your brother is like the control head"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"Yes"
01:45:00;01:45:03;"I think I know some of the other singles off this better"
01:45:03;01:45:03;"Huge album"
01:45:03;01:45:17;"Sounds crazy"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Yeah, drums are so hard"
01:45:19;01:45:26;"Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam"
01:45:27;01:45:33;"I mean that whole album just like"
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Must have sounded so futuristic at the time"
01:45:36;01:45:36;"Totally"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"So hard and weird"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"And it's like obviously it's very catchy"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"And there's like pop appeal"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"But it's like, you know, in some ways"
01:45:44;01:45:47;"It's like creating a blueprint that people still follow to this day"
01:45:47;01:45:51;"For like a minimalist, hard, futuristic pop music"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"I wonder what Hornsby thought of that"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Back in April of '86"
01:45:56;01:45:56;"When it came out"
01:45:56;01:45:59;"But I guess we're in July here"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"So July of '86"
01:46:00;01:46:04;"Bruce is cruising the Top 40 stations"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"Driving around, hitting Carl's Jr"
01:46:06;01:46:11;"I think you'd probably be like impressed by the production"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"You know, it's funny"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"I'm like looking at the word now"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"""Nasty"" is like one of those words"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"If you look at too long"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"It's just like such a strange word"
01:46:18;01:46:19;"""Nast"""
01:46:19;01:46:21;"""Nasty"""
01:46:21;01:46:22;"It's also like funny"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Because it says here that"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"""Nasty"" got a Trump bump"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"When then presidential candidate Donald Trump"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"Made a dismissive comment about his opponent Hillary Clinton"
01:46:31;01:46:32;"Which I'm sure everybody remembers"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"He goes, ""She's such a nasty woman"""
01:46:34;01:46:38;"Supposedly streams of this song spiked by 250%"
01:46:38;01:46:41;"Because I guess people hear the word ""nasty"""
01:46:41;01:46:41;"And they think about it"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"But it's also like funny"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Wait, Jake, when we were talking about Aerosmith"
01:46:45;01:46:48;"Didn't you keep calling them ""nasty""?"
01:46:48;01:46:49;"When were we talking about like"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"I think I did, yeah"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"Was that the word that you were using?"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"""Nasty"""
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Yeah, yeah, just kind of a nasty groove"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"But it's also like, yeah"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Obviously Janet Jackson's using it"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"In a kind of like a sexy way"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Like ""nasty"""
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Because obviously you could be like freaky and nasty"
01:47:05;01:47:08;"But for me, again"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Might just be a product of my era"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"I just feel like being a kid in the 90s"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"I just think of like some like little skater dude"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"With like a butt cut"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"Just like a bunch of ants"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Like on a hot dog bun"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"That's like on the street"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Just be like, ""Oh, nasty"""
01:47:22;01:47:24;"It's like Beavis and Butt-Head vibe"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"Or like Bart Simpson"
01:47:25;01:47:26;"""Nasty"""
01:47:26;01:47:28;"""Ew, nasty"""
01:47:28;01:47:29;"Yeah, and then there was those"
01:47:29;01:47:32;"Like on the 1990 Reds"
01:47:32;01:47:33;"There was these three relief pitchers"
01:47:33;01:47:36;"Called the ""Nasty Boys"""
01:47:36;01:47:37;"Really?"
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Yeah"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"You think that was referencing the Janet Jackson song?"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"Because she's talking about ""Nasty Boys"""
01:47:42;01:47:44;"No, because I think it's like"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"It's a classic like baseball term"
01:47:45;01:47:48;"Like ""That guy's got a real nasty slider"""
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Right, but not ""He's nasty"""
01:47:50;01:47:52;"It'd probably be like ""He's got a nasty slider"""
01:47:52;01:47:54;"""He's got nasty stuff"""
01:47:54;01:47:57;"It was derived from the lyrics of Janet Jackson's song ""Nasty"""
01:47:57;01:47:58;"Oh, it was?"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Oh, the ""Nasty Boys""?"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Yeah"
01:48:00;01:48:01;"That's amazing"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"""Nasty"""
01:48:03;01:48:06;"The number four song this week in 1986"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"We're just sticking with '86 right now"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"Howard Jones, ""No One Is To Blame"""
01:48:11;01:48:11;"Oh, damn"
01:48:11;01:48:14;"For some reason, this just sounds like a song that you would know, Jake"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"I love this song"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Is this a Eileen's car kind of childhood memory?"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Oh my god, yeah, dude"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"I always get confused"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"It's legit gorgeous"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"So he was kind of like an 80s pop guy?"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"Yeah, British"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"I think I'd always see his name around"
01:48:31;01:48:36;"And I'd be confused because it sounds like a dude who'd be in a punk band"
01:48:36;01:48:37;"Yeah"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Like one of the dudes in the Buzzcocks name was Howard"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"And then obviously there's like Mick Jones from The Clash"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"So like Howard Jones just sounds like a punk dude to me"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Totally"
01:48:45;01:48:52;"Phil Collins produced this and sings harmony on it later in the song"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"That's a little context"
01:48:53;01:48:56;"It's like 80s power ballad"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"I wonder what Hornsby would have thought of like this type of music"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"It's not a million miles away from his stuff"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Right"
01:49:03;01:49:05;"But obviously with his kind of like jazz stuff"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"He's like a little bit more sophisticated"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"You know, I think it's a good thing that he's not a musician"
01:49:11;01:49:14;"He's like a little bit more sophisticated"
01:49:14;01:49:20;"Yeah, Hornsby has a more specific and unique kind of language"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"This doesn't sound like people who love Steely Dan and Keith Jarrett"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"No"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"It's good though"
01:49:25;01:49:29;"This is like big Peter Sotera fans"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Yeah"
01:49:31;01:49:38;"Do you know this song, Anthony?"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"I don't know this song"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Really?"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"I like his voice"
01:49:42;01:49:57;"I take it back"
01:49:57;01:49:58;"This song is sophisticated"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"It's just different"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"The number three song this week in 1986"
01:50:03;01:50:06;"Elda Barge, who's Johnny?"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Hello"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"How familiar are you with Elda Barge, Jake?"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Not very"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"This is s*** that Rashida knows inside out"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"Oh wow"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"I knew very little about Elda Barge"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"What's the Elda Barge story?"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"It's like a really successful musical family"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"So they had the group that was called Da Barge"
01:50:23;01:50:28;"And I guess Elda Barge was like the oldest brother in the group"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Who like wrote a lot of the songs and stuff"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Oh"
01:50:32;01:50:41;"This song is sick"
01:50:41;01:50:45;"Johnny"
01:50:45;01:50:46;"So you remember this?"
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Oh yeah"
01:50:47;01:50:50;"I guess Elda Barge didn't write this song"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"But he's like a great writer"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"This is written by Peter Wolfe"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"So this song is from Short Circuit"
01:50:56;01:50:59;"The movie about a robot named Johnny Fog"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"He's talking about Johnny the Robot"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"I guess"
01:51:02;01:51:08;"Of course we can't recommend that anybody watches Short Circuit"
01:51:08;01:51:13;"Because it infamously has a white person playing an Indian person"
01:51:13;01:51:14;"Oh really?"
01:51:14;01:51:15;"In brownface"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"I kind of remember being a kid and like seeing this on"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"Like really like a little kid seeing it on TV when I was like seven"
01:51:20;01:51:21;"I mean like this is an interesting movie"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"And then having like very vague memories of it"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"And I kind of remember that there's a"
01:51:27;01:51:31;"One of the lead characters was Indian and had a strong Indian accent"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"But you know I was like a little kid so I didn't remember much about it"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"It was played by that actor Fisher Stevens"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"Then years later being like oh that was just like a white dude"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"With his like face done up like"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"Wild"
01:51:42;01:51:46;"So anyway if there any TC heads were about to throw on that film"
01:51:46;01:51:49;"I have not seen that movie in like 35 years probably"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"Short Circuit"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"And I think there was like a sequel"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"It must have been pretty successful"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"Apparently the character in Short Circuit was named after the song"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Not the other way around"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"Yeah I'm looking at the lyrics it doesn't really sound like a robot"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"There's no references to circuits or robotics"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"Lasers"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Cool song though"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"Yeah it's fun"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"The barge had like so many massive hits"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Rhythm of the Night I like it"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"They're almost like the Jackson 5 of the 80s"
01:52:15;01:52:22;"The number two song is another kind of like very classic 80s soft rock"
01:52:22;01:52:26;"I mean this must be the type of s*** Jake you're hearing driving around"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"In Aileen's car back then"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Simply Red Holding Back the Years"
01:52:30;01:52:48;"I feel like Hornsby would respect this song"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"For sure"
01:52:50;01:52:55;"Oh"
01:52:56;01:52:56;"Yeah okay"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Love this one"
01:52:59;01:53:03;"Thinking of the fear I've had so long"
01:53:03;01:53:07;"When somebody's here"
01:53:07;01:53:13;"Listen to the fear that's gone"
01:53:13;01:53:22;"Strangled by the wishes of fate"
01:53:22;01:53:27;"Hoping for the arms of fate"
01:53:27;01:53:33;"I'll get to me the sooner or later"
01:53:33;01:53:39;"You know there's that R.L.Fink song that seems like deeply influenced by this"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Yes"
01:53:41;01:53:53;"Holding back the years"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Great production"
01:53:55;01:53:59;"For me escaping from all I know"
01:53:59;01:54:04;"Yeah but there's a lot of tension you know it's like it's building"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"It's interesting it doesn't just sound retro either"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"Right"
01:54:07;01:54:11;"It's like obviously they're referencing cool 70s like soul music"
01:54:11;01:54:17;"I've wasted all my tears"
01:54:17;01:54:23;"Wasted all those years"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"I should really work on that Aileen's car playlist"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"Would this be on it?"
01:54:27;01:54:30;"This would be on there the Howard Jones would be on there"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"It's very interesting lyrics too because the song's called Holding Back the Years"
01:54:34;01:54:38;"Which is the opening line but then he only says it once"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"Because then later he says the more expected holding back the tears"
01:54:41;01:54:45;"And then the chorus is not I'll keep holding back the years"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"It's I'll keep holding on"
01:54:46;01:54:49;"I guess that's what like real poetry is"
01:54:49;01:54:52;"Is when you kind of match up a phrase"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"That doesn't totally make sense on its face"
01:54:55;01:54:59;"But then the more you think about it it actually does connote like a weird feeling"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Holding back the years"
01:55:00;01:55:01;"What does that mean?"
01:55:01;01:55:04;"Like you're holding on to time passing or you don't want it to pass"
01:55:04;01:55:08;"But it does feel like appropriate and heavy holding back the years"
01:55:08;01:55:09;"What's your interpretation Jake?"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"Well yeah it's a great phrase"
01:55:11;01:55:16;"I don't think he was like I'm seeing this little note here that"
01:55:16;01:55:22;"The songwriter uh Mick Hucknall was in art school and his teacher said"
01:55:22;01:55:27;"The greatest paintings are produced when the artist is working in the stream of consciousness"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"Which Hucknall then tried to apply to songwriting"
01:55:29;01:55:33;"Holding back the years was the second song he wrote using this method"
01:55:33;01:55:36;"Of stream of conscious consciousness"
01:55:36;01:55:40;"I mean my guess would be he kind of just stuck with the first words that came to him"
01:55:40;01:55:44;"Right maybe this phrase just tumbled out holding back the years"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"I mean that must happen when you're writing songs right?"
01:55:46;01:55:46;"That like"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"Oh yeah of course"
01:55:47;01:55:50;"But then it's like you could have just called the song holding on"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"But he knew there was something about that phrase"
01:55:52;01:55:57;"Maybe because it was stream of consciousness that weirdly felt like deeper"
01:55:57;01:55:57;"Yeah"
01:55:57;01:56:01;"I'm sure a lot of people if you're like you know that uh Simply Red song"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"They'd be like oh yeah holding on"
01:56:03;01:56:03;"Right"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"The number one song"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"I don't think I know this one"
01:56:07;01:56:12;"1986 this week the number one song from the album Love Zone"
01:56:12;01:56:17;"Billy Ocean there will be sad songs to make you cry"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Did we hear this recently?"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"I think we heard a different Billy Ocean song"
01:56:23;01:56:26;"I guess he was just crushing it in the 80s"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"We did like 85 recently maybe"
01:56:27;01:56:28;"Yeah"
01:56:28;01:56:35;"We listened to Billy Joel or Billy Ocean suddenly on the recent Jonah Hill episode"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"That was another ballad"
01:56:37;01:56:37;"Yeah"
01:56:37;01:56:46;"Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes"
01:56:47;01:56:50;"When I'm standing beside you"
01:56:50;01:56:54;"There's a fever burning deep inside"
01:56:54;01:56:58;"Is there another in your memory?"
01:56:58;01:57:02;"Do you think of that someone"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"When you hear that special melody?"
01:57:05;01:57:10;"I always stop and think of you especially"
01:57:10;01:57:14;"When the words of a love song"
01:57:14;01:57:17;"Touch the very heart of me"
01:57:17;01:57:22;"There'll be sad songs to make you cry"
01:57:22;01:57:27;"Love songs often do"
01:57:27;01:57:33;"They can touch the heart of someone new"
01:57:33;01:57:37;"Saying I love you"
01:57:37;01:57:42;"I love you"
01:57:42;01:57:46;"I often wonder how it could be"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"Hell yeah"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"I mean he's a great singer"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"I don't understand what this song is about"
01:57:51;01:57:54;"There will be sad songs to make you cry"
01:57:54;01:57:55;"Love songs often do"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"They can touch the heart of someone new"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Saying I love you, I love you"
01:57:59;01:58:06;"I guess it's just generally about the fact that songs can be tied to people and memories"
01:58:06;01:58:09;"Yeah it's a bit of a word salad"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"Play the second verse maybe that'll clarify things"
01:58:11;01:58:15;"I'll count the hours until that day"
01:58:15;01:58:23;"A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me"
01:58:23;01:58:27;"Until the moment that you give your love to me"
01:58:27;01:58:30;"You're the one I care for"
01:58:30;01:58:34;"The one that I would wait for"
01:58:34;01:58:40;"There'll be sad songs to make you cry"
01:58:40;01:58:42;"He's talking about the potential of songs"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"Yeah"
01:58:43;01:58:47;"There will be sad songs to make you cry"
01:58:47;01:58:51;"Is there an element of maybe this is like a new relationship?"
01:58:51;01:58:54;"She's totally done with her ex"
01:58:54;01:58:59;"But she has to admit that there's like a deep reservoir of emotion there"
01:58:59;01:59:03;"She's really excited about this new relationship but sometimes she gets caught up in it"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"And sometimes she hears a slightly older song"
01:59:08;01:59:13;"And she's overcome with thoughts of that former love"
01:59:13;01:59:16;"And this is like her current boyfriend being like"
01:59:16;01:59:23;"One day there will be new sad songs and love songs that you'll associate with me"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"I have a bit of context on the track if you want"
01:59:25;01:59:26;"Oh, oh please"
01:59:26;01:59:29;"So according to producer Barry Eastman"
01:59:29;01:59:33;"The song was inspired by an incident involving Ocean's hit song from the previous year"
01:59:33;01:59:37;"Suddenly Eastman said the song is about a friend of his wife's"
01:59:37;01:59:40;"Who had recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend"
01:59:40;01:59:43;"While at a party thrown by her new boyfriend"
01:59:43;01:59:46;"The song suddenly was played and she broke down in tears"
01:59:46;01:59:47;"Being reminded of her ex"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"Oh, damn"
01:59:48;01:59:52;"Eastman used this scenario as the basis for writing"
01:59:52;01:59:54;"There'll be sad songs to make you cry"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"So kind of a meta commentary"
01:59:57;02:00:01;"Everybody's entitled to feel the way they feel and experience their emotions"
02:00:01;02:00:05;"But that it's got to be pretty harsh to be somebody's new boyfriend"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"And you're just throwing a party"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"All your friends come over"
02:00:09;02:00:12;"And then somebody throws on a Billy Ocean track"
02:00:12;02:00:15;"Next thing you know, everybody out"
02:00:15;02:00:16;"She's really upset"
02:00:16;02:00:16;"Why?"
02:00:16;02:00:19;"That song reminds her of her ex-boyfriend"
02:00:19;02:00:20;"Just like, damn"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"Oh, man"
02:00:22;02:00:25;"Jake, do you have any songs that just like stop you in your tracks?"
02:00:25;02:00:28;"Desperado"
02:00:28;02:00:31;"When you hear that, just like, give me a minute"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"That stops me cold in my tracks"
02:00:33;02:00:34;"Like the Seinfeld"
02:00:34;02:00:37;"Yeah, just like the Seinfeld"
02:00:37;02:00:38;"Your wife being like, hey, guys"
02:00:38;02:00:41;"You got to go watch the Super Bowl somewhere else"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Jake just heard Desperado"
02:00:43;02:00:45;"Now he's thinking about his ex-girlfriend"
02:00:45;02:00:46;"Thank you for understanding"
02:00:46;02:00:47;"He's a complete wreck"
02:00:47;02:00:51;"I don't really think so"
02:00:51;02:00:52;"Do you?"
02:00:52;02:00:55;"I mean, I feel like we're too like"
02:00:55;02:00:56;"Too tough"
02:00:56;02:01:00;"Too alienated and, you know, ironic or something"
02:01:00;02:01:04;"Yeah, even the most beautiful love song is not going to penetrate"
02:01:04;02:01:07;"All those Borgesian layers of irony and alienation"
02:01:07;02:01:11;"Well, no, of course I can be very moved listening to music"
02:01:11;02:01:11;"Of course"
02:01:11;02:01:14;"I could never see myself getting so overwhelmed at a party"
02:01:14;02:01:18;"That I would potentially embarrass my current partner"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"By becoming a wreck about a former one"
02:01:20;02:01:24;"I guess also the times when I can really connect to music"
02:01:24;02:01:28;"Often are in quiet contemplative moments"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"Like say in a movie theater or just watching a movie"
02:01:30;02:01:33;"Where sometimes, you know, nobody else is talking"
02:01:33;02:01:37;"And all you can do is listen to the song, you know, augmented by the images"
02:01:37;02:01:38;"I can be really moved in that scenario"
02:01:38;02:01:43;"Obviously at a concert where the music is taking over everything"
02:01:43;02:01:46;"And definitely when I just sit down to listen to music"
02:01:46;02:01:49;"And I've definitely had that, you know, sitting at an airport or something"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"Sitting on a train"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"You're just like scrolling through a playlist"
02:01:53;02:01:54;"And then you just start listening to a song"
02:01:54;02:01:57;"And then like 30 seconds in you're just like"
02:01:57;02:01:59;"It hits you really, really deeply"
02:01:59;02:02:00;"A hundred percent"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"But I guess what all those scenarios have in common"
02:02:02;02:02:06;"Is that it's like your whole brain is listening to the music mostly"
02:02:06;02:02:11;"Versus like, I guess what this Billy Ocean story sounds like to me"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"Is almost like Pavlovian"
02:02:13;02:02:13;"Yeah"
02:02:13;02:02:17;"I could name 20 songs that could like bring tears to my eyes in the right moment"
02:02:17;02:02:20;"That can make me think about life and the past and the pre-"
02:02:20;02:02:22;"You know, a hundred, of course"
02:02:22;02:02:26;"But again, that would have to be in a moment where I'm really engaged with the song"
02:02:26;02:02:31;"I don't know about like hearing it like tinnily coming out of a speaker at CVS"
02:02:31;02:02:34;"While somebody's like, ""Uh, excuse me, where's the shaving cream?"""
02:02:34;02:02:39;"I'm not gonna like hear a little bit of a song and just be like, ""Oh, oh my God"""
02:02:39;02:02:41;"Like, where'd you go, man?"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"Just like, I assume you heard those opening notes"
02:02:43;02:02:47;"I was 20 years ago, you know, I don't, I can't relate to that"
02:02:47;02:02:52;"I think a lot of people are like transported emotionally by music"
02:02:52;02:02:55;"Like when you hear like an oldies station"
02:02:55;02:02:58;"And they're like playing like Good Times and Great Oldies"
02:02:58;02:03:01;"And then like they'll play like a little drop from like a listener that's like"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"I just love this oldie station so much"
02:03:03;02:03:06;"It reminds me of my like being young and like"
02:03:06;02:03:07;"Right"
02:03:07;02:03:10;"Feeling the way I did in those days, basically is what they're saying"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"And I've never related to that"
02:03:12;02:03:16;"I don't like listen to like 90s pavement records"
02:03:16;02:03:21;"And I'm not like, ""Summer of '96, dude, let me tell you, dude, I was crushing it"""
02:03:21;02:03:22;"I know, yeah"
02:03:22;02:03:23;"And like, do you know what I mean?"
02:03:23;02:03:26;"I feel you, maybe, I don't know"
02:03:26;02:03:30;"Yeah, my, of course, I have associations with music"
02:03:30;02:03:35;"And of course, as both a fan and somebody who makes music"
02:03:35;02:03:36;"I'm very interested in those kind of like"
02:03:36;02:03:39;"I guess, slightly dry conversations about just like"
02:03:39;02:03:43;"What makes this sound like 1992 and not 1994?"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"Of course, I love that [ __ ]"
02:03:45;02:03:46;"That's the show"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"That's this whole show"
02:03:48;02:03:52;"So obviously, like we're both very engaged in like"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"What makes a year feel a certain way"
02:03:54;02:03:55;"But I know what you mean"
02:03:55;02:03:57;"It's like music is also"
02:03:57;02:04:00;"I can have new experiences with music all the time"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"And I definitely do"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"In some ways, I've thought about this a lot"
02:04:04;02:04:07;"Like I think I've learned more about songwriting and stuff"
02:04:07;02:04:11;"From going back to the same songs throughout my entire life"
02:04:11;02:04:13;"You know what I mean?"
02:04:13;02:04:15;"Just like some classic [ __ ]"
02:04:15;02:04:15;"Just like"
02:04:15;02:04:15;"Sure"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"I don't know, Hornsby was talking about"
02:04:17;02:04:20;"Joni Mitchell or something"
02:04:20;02:04:21;"And I could think about like, you know"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"Some of those iconic songs from Blue"
02:04:23;02:04:26;"Like ""Case of You"" or ""California"" or something"
02:04:26;02:04:29;"I really feel like every decade of my life"
02:04:29;02:04:33;"I've engaged with those songs and like thought new things"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"And learned new things about songwriting"
02:04:35;02:04:37;"And learned new things about human emotion"
02:04:37;02:04:38;"You know, all that stuff"
02:04:38;02:04:40;"So the things that make me feel like"
02:04:40;02:04:43;"Overwhelmed by like nostalgia"
02:04:43;02:04:45;"Or like take me back to a different moment"
02:04:45;02:04:47;"It's not exactly a song"
02:04:47;02:04:49;"You know, occasionally you end up on YouTube"
02:04:49;02:04:50;"And you see like"
02:04:50;02:04:53;"It might be just like tacked on to a video you're watching"
02:04:53;02:04:54;"Or it might be the whole video"
02:04:54;02:04:57;"Where it's just kind of like a block of commercials"
02:04:57;02:04:59;"From Sunday afternoon"
02:04:59;02:04:59;"Sure"
02:04:59;02:05:03;"From a local New York station, 1997"
02:05:03;02:05:04;"When I see stuff like that"
02:05:04;02:05:07;"And that combination of like all of those elements together"
02:05:07;02:05:10;"That is the stuff that almost can send a chill down my spine"
02:05:10;02:05:12;"Where I'm just like, I kind of feel like"
02:05:12;02:05:15;"I stuck my head into like a river of time for a second"
