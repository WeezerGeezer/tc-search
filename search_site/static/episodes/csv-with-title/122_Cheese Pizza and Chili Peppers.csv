00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis in a time of crisis, united by FaceTime to make this Time Crisis."
00:07;00:14;"On this episode, we talk red hot chili peppers, also Munch's make-believe band."
00:14;00:20;"All that, plus the top 5 hits of 1977 and 2020."
00:20;00:24;"This is a spicy Neapolitan."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:30;"Let's dig in."
26:25;26:34;"I was thinking about a band that maybe could have taken the mantle from Aerosmith in terms of huge American bands with multi-decade runs."
26:34;26:39;"Chili Peppers. Did anyone bring them up as the greatest American band?"
26:39;26:40;"Yeah."
26:40;26:42;"Did we get an email about Chili Peppers?"
26:42;26:46;"Like about the Chili's being the greatest American band? I mean that's preposterous, but..."
26:46;26:50;"They've sold 80 million albums worldwide. Huge."
26:50;26:51;"I'm not a fan."
26:51;26:54;"[Explosion]"
26:54;26:57;"I love Blood Sugar Sex Magic and I'm out."
26:57;26:59;"Guys, we did get an email about this."
26:59;27:01;"We did get an email, right? What does the email say?"
27:01;27:04;"It's a long one, but I think the key phrase is..."
27:04;27:05;"Yeah, summarize it."
27:05;27:11;"Whether we'd like to admit it or not, RHCP was, for a period, at least the most popular rock band in the world."
27:11;27:15;"Second only to U2. I'll forward it to you."
27:15;27:17;"Second only to U2."
27:17;27:26;"Well, first of all, Jake, that's kind of harsh to say that you are not a fan when you would also say you love one of their albums."
27:26;27:28;"Yeah, Blood Sugar Sex Magic is sick."
27:28;27:32;"I just don't need any more music from them outside of that record."
27:32;27:34;"You just think that was a perfect album?"
27:34;27:36;"I think that's Rick Rubin's finest work."
27:36;27:45;"It is a pretty amazing moment and anybody who hasn't seen it, I highly recommend Funky Monks, which is hard to track down sometimes,"
27:45;27:50;"but that's a black and white documentary about the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magic."
27:50;27:58;"And that's when they're at that mansion in Laurel Canyon and you get Rick in there, Chaz Smith riding his motorcycle."
27:58;28:00;"It is pretty amazing."
28:00;28:07;"This might be a generational thing, Jake, but I find some people really love Californication,"
28:07;28:12;"which came out six or seven years after that."
28:12;28:17;"Because I think for a lot of people, they love Under the Bridge and that kind of RHCP vibe."
28:17;28:20;"And then Californication was almost like an album of that."
28:20;28:22;"Do you remember when you first heard Scar Tissue?"
28:22;28:25;"That's a beautiful song. Would you agree?"
28:25;28:31;"Yeah, no, sure. The Californication period and after is just too slick."
28:31;28:38;"There's no grit. There's no texture to it. It's just very cold and corporate sounding to me."
28:38;28:43;"Blood Sugar, there's a real sense of atmosphere. It's like music from Big Pink or something."
28:43;28:51;"In what sense? Just an American band at the height of their powers hold up in a residential home?"
28:51;28:56;"Yes, a residential recording situation. No, I do love the mythology of that."
28:56;29:04;"But also, that's a crazy sounding album. Breaking the Girl, the production on that, all those acoustics,"
29:04;29:07;"it almost sounds like Rubber Soul or something."
29:07;29:10;"When you look Under the Hood on that album, because for whatever reason,"
29:10;29:17;"when I think of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, I just picture the black and white video for Suck My Kiss."
29:17;29:20;"And I just picture funky rapping, right out Chili Peppers."
29:20;29:25;"Oh, wait, by the way, Seinfeld, real quick, go to Anthony Kiedis' Wikipedia page."
29:25;29:29;"I have a feeling I know what it says. What's his opening line?"
29:29;29:34;"Like Jake is an American painter and radio personality. What's Anthony Kiedis'?"
29:34;29:38;"Anthony Kiedis is an American singer, songwriter and rapper."
29:38;29:43;"Yeah, that's what I thought. I feel like I was on his page a while ago and that just stuck with me."
29:43;29:47;"The first track on Blood Sugar Sex Magic is that song, The Power of Equality."
29:47;29:49;"I mean, he's straight up rapping, right?"
29:49;29:53;"Yeah, he's kind of, or I guess straight up rapping. I haven't heard it in a long time."
29:53;29:57;"But I remember thinking at the time, oh damn, Kiedis is rapping."
29:57;30:02;"Yeah, and I think he raps on some of the early records too. That's a part of what they did."
30:02;30:06;"So yeah, he's an American singer, songwriter and rapper."
30:06;30:09;"Also author. He wrote a great memoir."
30:09;30:12;"But I know what you mean. Because when I think of that record, what I was starting to say is that"
30:12;30:16;"I think of Suck My Kiss, just like funky, pow, pow."
30:16;30:22;"And just him rapping and just like that kind of, you know, basically bass, guitar, drums, vocals."
30:22;30:26;"You know, that kind of stuff. But then when you look under the hood on some of those songs,"
30:26;30:31;"Breaking the Girl and Under the Bridge, like Under the Bridge at the end, a choir comes in"
30:31;30:37;"and they're like banging on like oil cans or something. It's not like a simple minimalist album"
30:37;30:41;"where every song is just like, you know, a killer three piece plus vocals."
30:41;30:45;"There are these like really interesting moments that kind of give that album color"
30:45;30:48;"and tie it into the classic rock tradition."
30:48;30:52;"In terms of like nasty American rock bands, Aerosmith and Chili Peppers."
30:52;30:57;"I don't think it's fair to put them together. I don't think that's fair."
30:57;30:59;"What's your definition of nasty?"
30:59;31:04;"Just like kind of nasty, like funk and like blues. It's just like..."
31:04;31:07;"But you mean nasty in a negative way?"
31:07;31:11;"Not like Flea and Chad, you guys were so locked in tonight. It was nasty."
31:11;31:15;"Thanks Jake, I really appreciate that."
31:15;31:20;"I kind of mean it in both ways. I mean, obviously like, yeah, they're nasty in that sense"
31:20;31:24;"that they're like completely crushing it. Absolutely sick groove."
31:24;31:31;"But the grooves are nasty, like in a subjective aesthetic sense that I think is gross."
31:31;31:37;"And also, yeah, if I follow your logic, when you talk about the dead,"
31:37;31:42;"the dead is not nasty in either way. It's like even an amazing moment with the dead,"
31:42;31:48;"just like Jerry just doing like a lightning fast riff or everybody's really locked in."
31:48;31:53;"It's still not like a white boy stank face moment. It's still not, ""Oh!"""
31:53;31:59;"It's like the light touch of like a Kreutzmann or a Garcia is never like, ""Oh yeah!"""
31:59;32:01;"Like it's never that kind of nasty."
32:01;32:04;"It's never House of Blues. It's never a Guitar Center. It's never House of Blues."
32:04;32:08;"Nastiness is not necessarily negative, but it is..."
32:08;32:11;"I could see the way your taste leans away from it."
32:11;32:17;"And I guess also there's something like, there's something just like more sexual about those bands"
32:17;32:21;"in like not exactly a cool way."
32:21;32:23;"You know what I mean?"
32:23;32:25;"No, absolutely, dude."
32:25;32:30;"Just like some like Howard Stern, like obviously there's plenty of good sexy music."
32:30;32:35;"It's a part of human life, but there's something like, yeah, there's like Howard Stern nasty."
32:35;32:39;"Just like, ""Ugh!"" Like, ""Yeah!"""
32:39;32:44;"80s Stern sensibility."
32:44;32:47;"80s Stern meets Guitar Center."
32:47;32:50;"It's rough. It's rough stuff."
32:50;32:52;"Big overlap."
32:52;32:55;"That could be a later Mountain Bruise EP."
32:55;33:01;"Jake's mood board is a picture of 80s Howard Stern and a picture of Guitar Center."
33:01;33:07;"Have you guys heard Out in L.A., Red Hot Chili Peppers' first track that featured Anthony Kiedis rapping?"
33:07;33:10;"That's 80s? Is that like from Freaky Stylie or something?"
33:10;33:14;"Yeah, I think it was when the band was called Defunct."
33:14;33:18;"I threw on their first record about five years ago, and it was unlistenable."
33:19;33:22;"This sounds like the Talking Heads."
33:22;33:24;"Yeah."
33:49;33:51;"[coughing]"
33:55;33:57;"Okay."
33:57;33:59;"Kiedis got better."
33:59;34:01;"It's like a Graymaster Flash kind of cadence."
34:01;34:06;"Yeah, it reminds me of, ""Have you ever gone over to a friend's house to eat and the chicken just ate no good?"""
34:06;34:10;"I guess to be fair, you got to give them props too for even like,"
34:10;34:14;"when you consider that you had like the David Crosby's of the world and the Old Heads,"
34:14;34:20;"even George Harrison, I'm sad to report, I saw that recently, in the 80s just being like, ""Rap is not music."""
34:20;34:22;"Actually, that's maybe worth telling the story."
34:22;34:28;"I saw somebody posted this like old clip, like a newspaper clipping from the New York Post that was,"
34:28;34:30;"must have been the late 80s."
34:30;34:36;"And basically, they had a little news item about how George Harrison did an interview where somebody was like,"
34:36;34:40;"""What do you think about this, you know, the emerging form of hip-hop?"""
34:40;34:45;"And George Harrison was just like, ""I'm sorry, but it all sucks, man. You know?"
34:45;34:47;"Yeah, it's really not good. It's not music, man."""
34:47;34:54;"Or whatever, he made a derogatory comment about hip-hop, which most of the Old Heads were doing, sad to report, at the time."
34:54;35:01;"And then some journalist, I guess, went up to Chuck D, and this is in the early days, you know,"
35:01;35:08;"of like public enemy becoming this huge rap group, and I guess mentioned it to him or asked him what he thought."
35:08;35:13;"And then Chuck D just like, with a withering response, just said back, ""Who would you say it was, Harrison?"""
35:13;35:16;"""All right, well, you know, he's third string."""
35:16;35:21;"""If it was Lennon or McCartney, I might have to pause and think about it for a second, but Harrison, get the f*** out of here."""
35:21;35:28;"Which, a lot of people now, it's like cool to say Harrison's your favorite Beatle, but you have to respect that."
35:28;35:29;"That's hilarious."
35:29;35:33;"Harrison making like a pretty just kind of like uneducated comment about hip-hop."
35:33;35:36;"Just like, ""It all sucks."" And so he clearly wasn't giving it the time of day."
35:36;35:40;"Then you ask Chuck D, and Chuck D like knows his Beatles well enough to be like,"
35:40;35:44;"""Well, you know, Harrison's got a couple songs, but he's really not a top tier Beatle."
35:44;35:47;"Always going to be in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney."" You just like hit him where it hurt."
35:47;35:48;"And you're like, ""Fair play."""
35:48;35:49;"I love it."
35:49;35:55;"But anyway, that's all to say that like, even if it sounds a little awkward now, I do kind of respect Chili Pepper,"
35:55;36:03;"young Chili Peppers, 80s LA just being like, ""We love funk music, Led Zeppelin, hip-hop, and the Lakers."""
36:03;36:08;"It's like a real enthusiasm. It doesn't seem like, you know, some like..."
36:08;36:10;"No, it's not super calculated."
36:10;36:13;"Yeah, so you've got to love it. And also, I would also make the case that"
36:13;36:19;"people who hate on the Chili Peppers, it's often... I've seen it so many times, and it bothers me."
36:19;36:23;"I don't like it. When you see somebody make fun of the Chili Peppers, and the first thing they go is like,"
36:23;36:26;"""A bit of butter, but like, a bang, bing, a dang, wing, a ding."""
36:26;36:32;"They like pick up on... There's like a handful of Kiedis lyrical moments where he gets into his like,"
36:32;36:36;"""Wing-a-ding-dang"" type thing. And people love to make fun of that."
36:36;36:40;"And so sometimes I've seen people be like, ""Oh man, I mean like, listen, they got a few songs,"
36:40;36:45;"""Under the Bridge, whatever, but you know, the wing-a-ding-dang-a-dang, California Mop."""
36:45;36:48;"And also like, they make fun of him talking about California so much."
36:48;36:52;"But there's a part of me that's like, ""You know what? I mean, this goes back to the"
36:52;36:57;"""Everything dope has a touch of cringe, every silver lining has a chunk of dunk."""
36:57;37:02;"I'm kind of like, the fact that Kiedis can just get into his wing-a-ding-ding stuff,"
37:02;37:09;"and then also write these truly beautiful ballads about like, vulnerability and stuff."
37:09;37:12;"I'm like, that contrast makes me like them even more."
37:12;37:18;"I appreciate ""Under the Bridge"" more because it's on the same album as ""Suck My Kiss,"" for instance."
37:18;37:23;"You keep bringing up ""Suck My Kiss."" I think it's my favorite of like, the nasty Chili's like, funk songs."
37:23;37:30;"""When I'm sailing."" But yeah, I do feel you on the like... Yeah, without the ballads,"
37:30;37:35;"""Aerosmith"" to me is nothing, and Chili's to me are nothing."
37:35;37:39;"[laughter]"
37:39;37:43;"Anthony, listen to me. Without the ballads, you are nothing."
37:43;37:49;"You are absolutely nothing to me. You are garbage and trash with the ballads."
37:49;37:51;"However, you are something."
37:51;37:56;"They're sublime, Anthony. I'm like a curator. I'm a German curator."
37:56;38:02;"Anthony, your ballads. Kiedis definitely like, developed his own completely idiosyncratic vocal style,"
38:02;38:06;"much like Steve and Tyler, which is why I thought of the Chili's."
38:06;38:10;"To me, there's a Kiedis-Tyler through line."
38:10;38:15;"They're different generations, but they are very similar in their vibe."
38:15;38:20;"They've got deep souls, as is evidenced by the lyrics they wrote for their ballads."
38:20;38:24;"But they also got a streak of nasty that not everybody has."
38:24;38:27;"They're not bashful about their sexuality."
38:27;38:29;"[laughter]"
38:29;38:35;"Yeah, we just think back to the Chili Peppers just wearing socks on their d***s."
38:35;38:36;"Oh my God."
38:36;38:37;"And their light bulb heads."
38:37;38:38;"That was crazy."
38:38;38:42;"They are such an iconic mix of depth and goofiness."
38:42;38:45;"They are actually a very fascinating American band."
38:45;38:49;"I think whoever wrote that email deserves props."
38:49;38:51;"But again, it gets back to the same thing."
38:51;38:55;"Every American band you could think of, there's always this caveat where you're like,"
38:55;39:00;"you can just picture the person in the conversation just laughing it out of the room."
39:00;39:06;"Just be like, you know, you picture you're at Hank Azaria's poker night."
39:06;39:11;"And people are like, ""Alright, who's the American band that can go toe-to-toe"
39:11;39:13;"with the Stones, Led Zeppelin, whoever?"""
39:13;39:15;"And you're just like, ""RHCP."""
39:15;39:17;"Yeah, it doesn't track."
39:17;39:19;"That's just America, isn't it?"
39:19;39:23;"That the bands we're talking about, there's always something funny."
39:23;39:24;"So where do we end up?"
39:24;39:28;"Eagles, Aerosmith, and the Chili Peppers."
39:28;39:32;"Honorable mention for the Beach Boys."
39:32;39:35;"And the good old Grateful Dead, man."
39:35;39:38;"But part of the reason that we love the Dead is similar to the Chili Peppers,"
39:38;39:44;"is they have these like, ""What the f***"" moments that not everybody gets."
39:44;39:47;"It's like, why are they just..."
39:47;39:52;"Mostly Bob Weir's contributions."
39:52;39:57;"I can see the Dead through the eyes of somebody who would have been more into"
39:57;39:59;"Led Zeppelin and The Who or something."
39:59;40:05;"I can totally imagine somebody who was into that specific type of big-name rock bands"
40:05;40:10;"and them going to a Dead show in the late '70s and seeing these guys"
40:10;40:15;"just do a 15-minute version of ""Not Fade Away"" and just be like,"
40:15;40:17;"""What the f*** is this?"""
40:17;40:19;"And be like, ""No, but Jerry's really good."""
40:19;40:21;"And then even that, just not being able to..."
40:21;40:22;"I can see it through the haters' eyes."
40:22;40:26;"But anyway, the last thing I'll say is that one thought I have about this"
40:26;40:30;"is that maybe America also is just like, it's too big of a country."
40:30;40:36;"So we don't have a Rolling Stones, but we have Leonard Skinner and the Allman Brothers."
40:36;40:40;"You can't pick a Southern rock band to represent all of America."
40:40;40:44;"They represent where they're from and their beloved bands and their institutions."
40:44;40:47;"Or even Red Hot Chili Peppers are so California."
40:47;40:53;"A British band can be super British-y because it's a smaller country."
40:53;40:58;"And I'm sure English people would obviously still have their own regional biases"
40:58;41:02;"about which artists they feel represent them or their point of view."
41:02;41:05;"But all these bands, they're just so specific to their place."
41:05;41:08;"Red Hot Chili Peppers is obviously such an LA band."
41:08;41:12;"The idea of them representing the Purple Mountains of Majesty,"
41:12;41:15;"the Badlands of North Dakota."
41:15;41:17;"That's a really good point."
41:17;41:22;"The artist that makes me think that they sort of did that would be Springsteen in the '80s."
41:22;41:27;"Not a band, as discussed, but he was definitely reaching for that."
41:27;41:29;"That evens the playing field or something."
41:29;41:32;"If somebody was like, a lot of great bands started in London."
41:32;41:34;"The Clash, the Rolling Stones, whatever."
41:34;41:36;"What great band started in New York?"
41:36;41:38;"And then you'd be like, oh man, where to start? Velvet Underwear?"
41:38;41:42;"There's something about that conversation that suddenly feels like an even playing field."
41:42;41:45;"Or even just being like, if you went city by city,"
41:45;41:49;"what are great bands from LA or San Francisco as opposed to Manchester?"
41:49;41:52;"And you'd be like, well Manchester, of course you have the Smiths, Neogala."
41:52;41:57;"But San Francisco, you have the Grateful Dead and Green Day."
41:57;41:58;"The Dead Kennedys."
41:58;41:59;"Dead Kennedys."
41:59;42:04;"Something about that conversation, suddenly I can see it in focus more."
42:04;42:06;"And I'm kind of like, oh yeah, of course."
42:06;42:11;"These American cities have amazing histories, as do those English cities."
42:11;42:13;"It just all makes more sense that way."
42:13;42:17;"America never really had a fair shot. It's just too big of a country."
42:17;42:18;"Great thesis."
42:18;42:19;"Thank you."
42:19;42:23;"I've got a bad disease"
42:23;42:30;"Off from my brain is where I bleed"
42:30;42:34;"Insanity it seems"
42:34;42:41;"Has got me by my soul to squeeze"
42:41;42:45;"Without a love for me"
42:47;42:52;"Without a dietary's I squeeze"
42:52;42:57;"The angels in my dream"
42:57;43:03;"In turn to demons of greed that's me"
43:03;43:08;"Where I go I just don't know"
43:08;43:14;"Like I took, I took, I took it slow"
43:14;43:19;"When I find my peace of mind"
43:19;43:24;"I'm gonna give you some of my good time"
43:24;43:28;"We just took a short break and we started talking about coffee."
43:28;43:33;"And then suddenly everybody's got some, no pun intended, hot takes."
43:33;43:39;"So Jake and Nick just said to me that the first cup of the day has got to be hot."
43:39;43:46;"And these are two Angelinos living in this godforsaken desert town"
43:46;43:51;"with the cloudless skies and the sun beating down on you."
43:51;43:57;"And even in this environment, you two are insisting that the first cup of the day has got to be hot?"
43:57;43:58;"Absolutely."
43:58;43:59;"Yeah."
43:59;44:04;"I think my palate is what you, it doesn't matter what's going on with the temperature."
44:04;44:08;"My palate wants just sort of a hot coffee."
44:08;44:13;"Obviously in quarantine, I imagine people's options are somewhat limited"
44:13;44:20;"because it's not like you can just go take a bleary-eyed walk to the local coffee shop and get an iced coffee."
44:20;44:24;"So yeah, at home, the easiest way to make coffee generally is hot coffee."
44:24;44:29;"But wait, Seinfeld, from a Canadian perspective, you're also agreeing first cup of the day's got to be hot?"
44:29;44:34;"No, I wouldn't say, like, well, I think in Canada it's a little different."
44:34;44:39;"You don't want to be drinking cold coffee on, like, a February morning, for sure."
44:39;44:42;"Right, but then, you know, of course it can get hot in the summer in Canada."
44:42;44:48;"Yeah, but then I think you're in the habit of drinking hot coffee because of those winters, so it just sort of carries through."
44:48;44:52;"I mean, I guess there are certain people who will switch over, but that's never been my..."
44:52;44:55;"Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense because in the winter,"
44:55;45:00;"an average Canadian also gets in the habit of wearing a toque and snowshoes."
45:00;45:04;"That's a habit you break in the summer."
45:04;45:09;"Some people wear those toques year-round, though. Some people are going to wear a toque in July."
45:09;45:14;"I got to ask you, am I using that correctly? Does a toque imply kind of like a heavy-ish, like, knit winter hat?"
45:14;45:19;"It does, and I got to say, what do you call it here, beanie?"
45:19;45:21;"Yeah, often it's a beanie."
45:21;45:26;"A beanie, for me, is one of those, like, kids' multicolored hats with a propeller on top."
45:26;45:28;"Oh, right, like a '50s..."
45:28;45:32;"Like a 1950s, yeah, with, like, the spinning propeller."
45:32;45:38;"That's something I got to admit, is that any American who thinks that ""toque"" is a funny word,"
45:38;45:41;"there's nothing funnier about the word ""toque"" than ""beanie."""
45:41;45:43;"Arguably, ""beanie"" is even goofier."
45:43;45:45;"""Beanie"" sounds insane."
45:45;45:51;"But Seinfeld, what about now that you live in the godforsaken desert town of Los Angeles?"
45:51;45:57;"I'm drinking the cold brew. I'll have a bunch in the fridge, so I'll grab one in the morning,"
45:57;45:59;"but it doesn't really hit me. Like, I need more than that,"
45:59;46:05;"so the cold brew is almost just like a precursor to the main course, which is like a second cup of coffee."
46:05;46:06;"A hot coffee."
46:06;46:09;"The hot coffee. Yeah, I'm building up to that hot coffee."
46:09;46:13;"And there's no kind of temperature whiplash happening in your body?"
46:13;46:16;"Well, I'm doing this over the course of, let's say, an hour, an hour and a half,"
46:16;46:20;"so it's not like I'm just, like, pounding the cold brew then immediately into the hot coffee."
46:20;46:25;"I just got to say that I have such great memories of, in the old world,"
46:25;46:31;"not having a coffee yet, and bleary-eyed rolling up to a restaurant and ordering an iced coffee,"
46:31;46:35;"and it's coming out cold as f*** with some big ice cubes,"
46:35;46:41;"and just slurping down that restaurant-quality iced coffee, and just being off to the races,"
46:41;46:43;"often getting a second one very quickly."
46:43;46:48;"Or, you know, walking around on a hot New York day and just rolling up to Dunkin' Donuts"
46:48;46:53;"to get my big iced coffee, and just hitting that, and the combination of the caffeine"
46:53;46:58;"and the Arctic freeze of the ice, just an amazing feeling."
46:58;47:01;"I think the disadvantage of the ice, though, is that it melts,"
47:01;47:07;"so that by the end of the coffee, you're drinking, like, watery, diluted, kind of swill coffee."
47:07;47:09;"I think that's part of the charm of the iced coffee."
47:09;47:15;"I guess also I consume things so quickly. I'm a fast eater, I'm a fast drinker,"
47:15;47:19;"that that's not too much of a problem for me. I guess I see what you're saying."
47:19;47:25;"Sometimes when I'm having my third or fourth iced coffee of the day, like a 3pm one,"
47:25;47:29;"and it's like... I mean, I'm not saying it's not more. There's people who have 10."
47:29;47:31;"I'm saying third or fourth is like the end."
47:31;47:32;"Ice coffees?"
47:32;47:38;"Maybe. I'm picturing a small one. I'm picturing 3pm, rolling up to some coffee shop,"
47:38;47:42;"and not exactly needing it, but getting it to be social, and then holding it,"
47:42;47:46;"and then it gets watered down and feeling kind of gross about the whole situation."
47:46;47:49;"I agree. That's a bad feeling. But I'm just saying, first things first."
47:49;47:51;"I love that Arctic Blast."
47:51;47:57;"I like the concept of getting the iced coffee to be social. It's like it's booze."
47:57;47:58;"Totally."
47:58;48:04;"At a bar. I've done that move of like, ""I don't need this eighth beer, but I'm just going to nurse it."
48:04;48:09;"I'm going to hold it."" But doing that with iced coffee at 3pm is so funny."
48:09;48:14;"No, but you know what's funny? That's such a more familiar feeling to me than what you're talking about."
48:14;48:19;"Because even though I can on occasion drink, I'm not anti-drinking."
48:19;48:23;"It's just one of those things though where I just-- maybe sometime in college,"
48:23;48:27;"where people always pressure you to drink, I think maybe I just had one too many times"
48:27;48:31;"of getting too f***ed up or something, and I was like, ""I'm not going to not drink."""
48:31;48:36;"But a flip switched in me where I was just kind of like, ""I will never be forced to drink again."""
48:36;48:42;"And I'm very impressionable, but that was just one thing where I put my foot down,"
48:42;48:45;"and I did get to a point where it's kind of like, ""Yo, yo, come on. No, are you serious?"
48:45;48:47;"Come on, have another drink. I'm getting drinks."""
48:47;48:51;"That's just one thing where I put my foot down. I'm like, ""Friend, you can buy it."
48:51;48:54;"You can put it in front of me. I will not drink it. Save yourself the cash."
48:54;48:56;"I don't want it. I don't need it. I'll have a water."""
48:56;49:00;"For some reason, I got that way. Maybe because my body can process caffeine better."
49:00;49:01;"So there's less of a--"
49:01;49:07;"Do you never, ever, on that third or fourth iced coffee, ever go over the edge?"
49:07;49:11;"No, I feel like my body's got a limiter."
49:11;49:13;"I've got built-in compression."
49:13;49:18;"I can feel that I have as much as I need, and it's not exactly pleasant,"
49:18;49:23;"but somehow I don't get into that full-on just like, ""Whoa,"" crazy vibe."
49:23;49:25;"To me, it's almost like that feeling of just eating a little too much,"
49:25;49:28;"where you're just like, ""Mm,"" but you're not nauseous."
49:28;49:30;"That's the analogy that I would use."
49:30;49:32;"Well, time to change gears."
49:32;49:36;"Weirdly, we've had a lot of time-crisis-y stories in the news,"
49:36;49:39;"and we're kind of staying on top of them in a strange way."
49:39;49:43;"Very atypical for us, but we got a lot of people saying,"
49:43;49:47;"""Guys, there's some big corporate food shenanigans happening,"
49:47;49:51;"and it involves a place that we have not talked about very much on this show,"
49:51;49:53;"and that place is Chuck E. Cheese."""
49:53;49:58;"We got two very well-researched emails about it."
49:58;50:01;"It seems like it's about time to go deep on Chuck E. Cheese,"
50:01;50:03;"a little bit of corporate food history."
50:03;50:04;"It's time for--"
50:04;50:07;"Corporate Food History."
50:07;50:09;"Let's talk about it."
50:09;50:13;"We got emails from-- Who were they from?"
50:13;50:19;"I know one was from Holly McLaren, who's a longtime friend of the show."
50:19;50:21;"Didn't we meet Holly in Chicago, Jake?"
50:21;50:22;"Yeah, I think so."
50:22;50:27;"Holly, who runs the TCU Wikipedia page."
50:27;50:29;"Holly runs the TCU Wikip-- Oh."
50:29;50:33;"Yeah, let me do a quick fact check, but I'm 99% sure that's her."
50:33;50:36;"I think-- Because we met this great crew of TC heads"
50:36;50:39;"at the Richard Pictures show in Chicago."
50:39;50:41;"I think Holly was one of them."
50:41;50:45;"If I'm wrong, either way, Holly, you're still a pillar of the community,"
50:45;50:47;"because I've definitely seen your name pop up before."
50:47;50:48;"Yeah."
50:48;50:50;"She was talking about it, Chuck E. Cheese,"
50:50;50:53;"with their viral moment recently."
50:53;50:58;"We also got one from Justin Jordan, talking about the scandal."
50:58;51:03;"The TC community was right there, following this story."
51:03;51:07;"I guess to summarize why Chuck E. Cheese is in the news in the first place,"
51:07;51:09;"you guys, tell me if this is correct."
51:09;51:10;"This is my understanding."
51:10;51:14;"I didn't dive too deep on it, because I wanted to come in fresh."
51:14;51:17;"My basic understanding is that Chuck E. Cheese,"
51:17;51:22;"obviously, their bread and butter is pizza and games."
51:22;51:23;"Right?"
51:23;51:27;"You go there, you buy some soda and pizza,"
51:27;51:30;"but then the kids are just going wild, playing games."
51:30;51:31;"They have beer there."
51:31;51:35;"The parents are just chugging beer, kids are eating pizza, they're gaming."
51:35;51:40;"It's very much about the in-person experience of going to a Chuck E. Cheese."
51:40;51:44;"Chuck E. Cheese is not particularly known for takeout or delivery."
51:44;51:46;"Maybe they have it a little bit,"
51:46;51:49;"but obviously, Chuck E. Cheese is a real in-person kind of place."
51:49;51:53;"Wait, I have to just say, I'm sorry, but it would be insane,"
51:53;51:55;"as the parent of the oldest child here,"
51:55;51:59;"it would be insane to tell your kids that you were picking up Chuck E. Cheese"
51:59;52:01;"and not taking them there."
52:01;52:03;"[laughter]"
52:03;52:05;"They'd f***ing go insane."
52:05;52:12;"That kind of reminds me of some of the most brutally strict parents that I would know."
52:12;52:16;"I do kind of remember these kids in my town who I knew a little bit."
52:16;52:19;"And growing up, we didn't have cable,"
52:19;52:21;"so I already felt a little bit f***ed over, like,"
52:21;52:23;"""Man, how do I not have cable?"""
52:23;52:26;"I used to go and watch Beavis and Butthead over at Wes's house."
52:26;52:29;"But then I went over to these other kids' houses,"
52:29;52:32;"and their parents, obviously, they didn't have cable either,"
52:32;52:36;"but their parents would only let them watch PBS."
52:36;52:41;"They couldn't even watch the good shows on NBC or Channel 11 or something."
52:41;52:43;"They could only watch PBS."
52:43;52:45;"And even at that, there were hardcore restrictions."
52:45;52:47;"And I remember seeing that and being like,"
52:47;52:50;"""Wow, truly, our fate's worse than death."""
52:50;52:53;"The idea--and I like some PBS stuff--"
52:53;52:56;"but the idea, as a 10-year-old kid,"
52:56;52:58;"that the only channel you could watch is PBS,"
52:58;53:00;"I wept for them."
53:00;53:01;"It was so brutally strict."
53:01;53:03;"And actually, there's another family--"
53:03;53:05;"I didn't know them that well in my town,"
53:05;53:07;"but I remember other kids telling me"
53:07;53:10;"that this other family had very strict parents"
53:10;53:13;"and that they would only let them watch movies"
53:13;53:16;"that the parents had done their own."
53:16;53:17;"[laughter]"
53:17;53:18;"Wow."
53:18;53:22;"And I think the son in the family was really into comics and sci-fi,"
53:22;53:24;"but with some harsh restrictions."
53:24;53:26;"So I think he was really into Star Wars,"
53:26;53:30;"but his parents insisted on creating an edit of the--"
53:30;53:32;"You know one of the Star Wars movies has Princess Leia"
53:32;53:34;"in a kind of gold bikini?"
53:34;53:35;"Yeah, I think that's Return of the Jedi."
53:35;53:38;"Yeah, the parents would not let that pass in front of his eyes."
53:38;53:40;"So they did an edit where they took that out"
53:40;53:41;"and various violent--"
53:41;53:43;"I mean, it was probably nonsensical."
53:43;53:47;"But anyway, I can totally picture a super strict '90s parent"
53:47;53:50;"and the kids just like, ""For the love of God, Mom, at school,"
53:50;53:52;"all the kids are talking about this sick party"
53:52;53:54;"they went to at Chuck E. Cheese."
53:54;53:56;"I want to go so bad."
53:56;53:58;"Like I saw the commercial at my friend's house."
53:58;53:59;"I want to go so bad."""
53:59;54:02;"Just be like, ""Well, listen, Jason,"
54:02;54:04;"I know we probably seem pretty strict"
54:04;54:06;"compared to some of the other parents,"
54:06;54:07;"but we're reasonable people."
54:07;54:09;"You know, you'd be very pleased to know"
54:09;54:12;"that your father right now is on his way to Chuck E. Cheese"
54:12;54:16;"to pick up one cheese pie for you."
54:16;54:19;"You can go back to school and tell all the other kids"
54:19;54:22;"that you have also enjoyed Chuck E. Cheese."""
54:22;54:25;"And just like the kid just being like, ""Oh, my God."""
54:25;54:26;"I bet that's happened."
54:26;54:28;"I bet at least once or twice,"
54:28;54:30;"like an insanely strict parent and being like--"
54:30;54:32;"and be like, ""But it's also about the toys."""
54:32;54:36;"And be like, ""Your father also played skee-ball for 20 minutes"
54:36;54:39;"and he's bringing you back one of those little army men"
54:39;54:40;"with the parachutes."
54:40;54:42;"You cannot go there yourself,"
54:42;54:45;"but your father will bring you back the cheese pizza"
54:45;54:47;"plus the army men with the parachute."""
54:47;54:49;"Just like taking all the fun out of it."
54:49;54:51;"Jason's dad calls Chuck E. Cheese and is like,"
54:51;54:53;"""Hi, I'd like to make an order for pickup, please."""
54:53;54:55;"And they're like, ""Excuse me, sir?"""
54:55;54:57;"[laughing]"
54:57;54:59;"-Come again? -Just like the 16-year-old"
54:59;55:01;"who works there is just like, ""Um..."""
55:01;55:03;"""Let me check with my manager."
55:03;55:06;"I don't think we actually have to-go boxes on the premises."""
55:06;55:09;"You know what also probably has been a classic awkward exchange"
55:09;55:11;"between parents and Chuck E. Cheese employees"
55:11;55:13;"is just like the dad being like,"
55:13;55:17;"""All right, what's it gonna take for me to buy that Xbox?"""
55:17;55:19;"And they're like, ""Well, sir, you know,"
55:19;55:22;"it's, um, two million Chuck E. points."""
55:22;55:24;"""All right, cut the sh*t."
55:24;55:27;"I gotta get going. It's my kid's f*cking birthday."
55:27;55:29;"Now he's obsessed with winning this."
55:29;55:30;"What do I have to do?"""
55:30;55:32;"And just be like, ""Um..."""
55:32;55:34;"Or maybe that's built in."
55:34;55:36;"Maybe they have a list of prices"
55:36;55:38;"and they're just like jacked up prices just for parents to..."
55:38;55:42;"Trump's dad's Chuck E. Cheese is such a rough image."
55:42;55:44;"Oh, God."
55:44;55:46;"Picture how many times there's probably been like"
55:46;55:48;"a drunk parent rolling up with the kid"
55:48;55:50;"and the kid being like counting all the things"
55:50;55:53;"and then the kid being like three tickets short"
55:53;55:55;"of getting something."
55:55;55:57;"And dad being like, ""All right, I'll give you $3."""
55:57;56:00;"That's well above market value for, you know,"
56:00;56:02;"the cost of those tickets."
56:02;56:05;"""Um, sir, I can sell you some tokens."
56:05;56:08;"You can go back to Skee-Ball and you can win it."""
56:08;56:11;"And just be like, ""No. I've been here for four hours."""
56:11;56:13;"""Here's the tickets. Here's the five bucks."
56:13;56:16;"You give me that f***ing giant pencil now."""
56:16;56:17;"Oh, my God."
56:17;56:20;"I wonder if like that's the worst job is working at the, uh..."
56:20;56:21;"What do you call that?"
56:21;56:22;"The prize center?"
56:22;56:23;"Yeah."
56:23;56:24;"Well, what are the, um..."
56:24;56:26;"It's a fulfillment center."
56:26;56:27;"Exactly."
56:27;56:29;"Before Amazon, it was the Chuck E. Cheese fulfillment center."
56:29;56:32;"Fulfillment center is one of the all-time classic phrases."
56:32;56:36;"In terms of corporate euphemisms"
56:36;56:38;"for just like distro centers,"
56:38;56:40;"fulfillment center."
56:40;56:42;"That's pretty guided by voices, too."
56:42;56:44;"Fulfillment center."

58:00;58:03;"- So back to the main story, is that, so Chuck E. Cheese,"
58:03;58:07;"like all restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic,"
58:07;58:08;"they can't have people in."
58:08;58:11;"And Chuck E. Cheese is especially hard hit"
58:11;58:12;"because even though it's a restaurant,"
58:12;58:14;"it's all about having people there."
58:14;58:18;"I'm sure Dave & Buster's is really struggling right now too."
58:18;58:20;"And they're gonna, it's gonna be a tough road for them,"
58:20;58:23;"reopening with all the (beep) that people touch"
58:23;58:24;"with the video games and stuff."
58:24;58:27;"But so Chuck E. Cheese, I think they were trying"
58:27;58:31;"to figure out, well, we have our employees on the payroll."
58:31;58:35;"We have all this dough and cheese sitting here"
58:35;58:36;"and we have our ovens."
58:36;58:38;"Maybe we can get people to order from us."
58:38;58:41;"But who, again, who wants to, if you're gonna order"
58:41;58:44;"from a pizza just to be delivered to your home,"
58:44;58:46;"Chuck E. Cheese is gonna be the last place you think about."
58:46;58:51;"So because Chuck E. Cheese delivery sales were so low,"
58:51;58:53;"they figured, (beep) it, we can just rebrand,"
58:53;58:54;"make up a new name."
58:54;58:57;"And they started calling themselves Pascuales,"
58:57;58:59;"which is a reference to one of the characters"
58:59;59:02;"in the Chuck E. Cheese extended universe."
59:02;59:06;"So I guess somebody would be opening up Uber Eats,"
59:06;59:08;"Grubhub, DoorDash, any of that (beep)"
59:08;59:09;"and they would see, you know,"
59:09;59:12;"pizza near me, Italian restaurants near me."
59:12;59:14;"And they would see a place called Pascuales"
59:14;59:15;"and they would order."
59:15;59:17;"And then they would just get a Chuck E. Cheese pizza"
59:17;59:18;"delivered to their house without realizing"
59:18;59:20;"they were ordering from Chuck E. Cheese."
59:20;59:22;"So when this story broke open,"
59:22;59:26;"obviously people were dying with laughter, also offended."
59:26;59:28;"So that got us thinking about Chuck E. Cheese"
59:28;59:30;"and we realized, similar to Red Lobster last week,"
59:30;59:32;"we've talked about them very little."
59:32;59:34;"So Jake, you did a little bit of your own research."
59:34;59:38;"Take us back through the story of Chuck E. Cheese"
59:38;59:40;"before the Pascuales misadventure."
59:40;59:42;"- Well, yeah, I was surprised to learn that"
59:42;59:45;"Chuck E. Cheese is a product of Silicon Valley."
59:45;59:49;"Not only did it open in Silicon Valley,"
59:49;59:51;"the first location was in 1977,"
59:51;59:54;"which is obviously a year close to my heart."
59:54;59:56;"- The year Jake was born."
59:56;59:58;"- Jake and Kanye and Chuck E. Cheese"
59:58;01:00:02;"opened their first location in San Jose in '77."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- And when you say a product of Silicon Valley,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"you just mean it was in the region"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"or there's some kind of tech money behind it?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- There's deep tech money behind it."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"It was founded by a guy named Nolan Bushnell,"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"who was also the co-founder of Atari."
01:00:17;01:00:22;"He had started Atari back in 1972 in Silicon Valley"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"and he was looking, I think at the time in '77,"
01:00:26;01:00:30;"a lot of the arcade games were in pool halls, bars,"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"or those kind of classic arcades"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"that maybe older teens were hanging out at."
01:00:36;01:00:40;"He wanted to open a venue where children"
01:00:40;01:00:44;"and their parents could play arcade video games."
01:00:44;01:00:48;"And then he chose pizza because it's very easy"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"and hard to mess up, and kids like pizza."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"So yeah, just a few bullet points here."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"So he starts Atari in '72, and in '77,"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"the same year that he opens Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"he's looking for more capital to expand Atari"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"and he sells Atari to Warner Communications"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"for $28 million, which must have been huge at the time."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- Wow."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- And then the following year,"
01:01:10;01:01:14;"he's forced out of Atari by Warner."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"So he starts Atari, does it for five years,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"sells it, is forced out, then starts Chuck E. Cheese"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"basically around the same time."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And then Chuck E. Cheese is classic."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"It just goes to this series of different owners"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"and mergers that are just boring."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"- It was called Chuck E. Cheese from the jump?"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- Yeah, it was called Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"like Pizza Time Theater,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"some awkwardly long name initially."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And he was really inspired by Disney,"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"which is why he had all these animatronic animals"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"in the restaurant."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- Right, it's almost like a mini Disneyland."
01:01:47;01:01:52;"- And he thought he was buying an animatronic coyote,"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"but it ended up being a rat, which is how the rat,"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"and it was just hilarious to have a rat"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"as like a restaurant mascot."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- So Chuck E. Cheese is a rat, not a mouse."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Yes."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- I guess he's got that kind of long, long snout."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- So I found like a couple interesting anecdotes"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"related to Nolan Bushnell."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"In 1976, Steve Jobs approached Nolan Bushnell."
01:02:14;01:02:18;"He asked Nolan for $50,000 to put into Apple."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"And if Nolan had given him the 50 grand,"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"he would have had a third of Apple."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- Holy (beep)"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"- Yeah, so, but he turned Steve Jobs down."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"This was actually a thing I found in the Jobs biography"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"by Walter Isaacson."
01:02:33;01:02:36;"Steve asked me if I would put $50,000 in"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"and he would give me a third of the company."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"I was so smart, I said, no."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"It's kind of fun to think about it when I'm not crying."
01:02:42;01:02:46;"But it got me thinking of like the following year,"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"he opens Chuck E. Cheese"
01:02:48;01:02:51;"and he's like a big player around like Silicon Valley."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"And it got me thinking like,"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"did Steve Jobs go to the first Chuck E. Cheese?"
01:02:55;01:02:58;"Like, it's so funny to think about like"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"a year prior, Nolan had turned him down,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"but they're still in touch."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"Like, you know, maybe they're like acquaintances"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"professionally or socially, just like,"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Hey Steve, I'm opening this like children themed"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"pizza restaurant in San Jose."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Come on down for the opening."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"- Yeah, and also at that moment,"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Nolan is still kind of the man as compared to Steve."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"And he's like, Hey Steve, I know we haven't talked in a while."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"First of all, I hope there's no hard feelings"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"about me not kicking you the 50K."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"I'm sure you're going to do okay, even without me."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"But anyway, just so you know, there's no hard feelings."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I hope I didn't let you down too much with that one."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"I'd love for you and your girlfriend,"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"you could bring Wozniak to,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"come down to my grand opening,"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"all the pizza you want."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"And you know, there's some, you know, it's kid stuff,"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"but you know, it's kind of cute."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"You'll have a good time."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Just like magnanimously being like, come on down."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- I love the picture."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"And then the other thing I found that"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"really sparked my imagination was in 2008,"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"it was announced that Leonardo DiCaprio"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"would portray Nolan Bushnell in the film ""Atari,"""
01:04:02;01:04:04;"an adaption of Bushnell's life story,"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"which talk about missed opportunities."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"Okay."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Granted the like Silicon Valley,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Atari stuff would have been fascinating,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"but like the last third of the film where Leo was like"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"opening Chuck E. Cheese would have been like,"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"just full on like the last third of like good fellas."
01:04:21;01:04:24;"It just would have like been so good."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- Oh, amazing."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"- Leo in '77 opening Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"just, we really missed out."
01:04:30;01:04:35;"- '77, punk rock is just changing culture in the UK"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"and in Silicon Valley, San Jose,"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"opening the first Chuck E. Cheese."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"You know, that also makes me think of is like,"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"I don't know exactly when Steve Jobs got involved,"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"but not, you know, a decade or two later,"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Steve Jobs has his own children's"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"entertainment thing, Pixar."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"I know we take it for granted now that it's like,"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"of course, Pixar, you know, is part of Apple."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Steve Jobs was one of the original"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"or early investors, principals in Pixar."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"That was one, his baby along with the guys"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"who actually founded it."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"But still it's like, that's pretty unusual"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"that like a computer company was like getting"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"so interested in computer animation"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"and like changing the face of children's entertainment."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"Maybe Nolan Bushnell planted the seed back in the '70s."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Be like, it's not enough just to create"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"these like products, you know,"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"you need to like own the hearts and minds."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"You need IP, man."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"You need characters."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- Yeah, you gotta create a lifelong relationship"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"with children."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"- Another thing that I'm thinking of,"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I mean, Silicon Valley is obviously"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"such a fascinating, strange place,"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"that whole region of Northern California."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"I'm not being obsessive here."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"This is just right in front of me."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"You know what other American institution"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"got its start at a Silicon Valley pizzeria?"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"- Was it at the round table in Palo Alto?"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"'Cause that's where his round table started"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"in Palo Alto in the mid '60s."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Oh, the Dead, the Dead."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- The Dead."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"The first Grateful Dead concert."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"It might've been under the name of the Warlocks."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"See what comes up when you search"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"the first Grateful Dead concert."
01:06:04;01:06:07;"- Now, now, now, now, now, now,"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"let's get a number crunch."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza Parlor,"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"in suburban Menlo Park."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- Menlo Park, that's basically part of Palo Alto."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"What year was that, '65?"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"- May 5th, 1965."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"- It's only 12 years before..."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"Look, I'm not just trying to circle"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"the conversation back to the Dead here."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"I think that's striking."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Silicon Valley pizzerias,"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"with this weird connection to both"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"the Grateful Dead, Atari, Steve Jobs."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Suddenly you have this very interesting"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"patchwork of influential things."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Anyway, yeah, were there any more"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"twists and turns in the Chuck E. Cheese story?"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"- He was forced out of the Chuck E. Cheese board"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"in '84 when they were on the brink of bankruptcy."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"And that's where I'm picturing"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"the Leonardo DiCaprio movie kinda ending."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Just like..."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"(laughing)"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Yeah, just like... - Just down on his luck."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- I mean, he's doing fine."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"He's like, started Atari and he's out."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- Right. - Started Chuck E. Cheese"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"and he's out."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"And it's like 1984."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"And like, Apple is just becoming a sin at that point."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"- That's pretty rough though,"
01:07:11;01:07:15;"to get forced out of two of your brain children."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"You get forced out of Atari, then Chuck E. Cheese."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"I guess eventually he got the last laugh,"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"'cause Atari basically tanked after his era."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"- Yeah, I was reading today,"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"Atari was absolutely crushing it in '82,"
01:07:28;01:07:33;"but by '84 they were way on the outs."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"- There is a book that I read once called,"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"I think it was called Console Wars."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"It's basically about the war between Nintendo and Sega."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"- I remember you telling me about this."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"- Yeah, it's actually a pretty interesting book."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"And I think there was also a Hollywood,"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"like a variety article saying like,"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"that Seth Rogen optioned it."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"You know, that'd be kind of a tight movie."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"I must've referenced that, I'm sure,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"probably like 100 episodes ago,"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"because it's actually a really interesting story"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"about like corporate (beep)"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"because the guy who turned Sega around"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"wasn't a video game guy."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"He was a guy from Mattel,"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"who had kind of like spearheaded like He-Man"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"and like Strawberry Shortcake and (beep) like that."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And they brought this guy and he's like,"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"""Listen, I don't know a lot about video games,"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"""but what I do know is branding and IP"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"""and winning the hearts and minds of children."""
01:08:16;01:08:19;"And so anyway, Sega really gave Nintendo"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"a run for their money"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and they actually overtook them briefly in the '90s."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"But before that, before Nintendo just took over the world,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"the picture that they paint in this book"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"is that with the kind of collapse of Atari"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"in the early '80s,"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"there was this weird period in the mid '80s"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"where people were like, ""Video games are over."""
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- Yeah."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- In the world of toys and entertainment,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I guess the vibe everybody got was like,"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Atari had its run, which is always funny to think."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"I guess hindsight's 20/20,"
01:08:44;01:08:48;"but these moments in history where people looked at something"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"and they were like, ""Yeah, no, that was cool."""
01:08:50;01:08:51;"I bet people also felt that way"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"about all sorts of like musical genres."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"I'm sure there was a moment when after,"
01:08:55;01:08:58;"in like the early '80s, after like ""Rapper's Delight,"""
01:08:58;01:09:00;"people were like, ""Well, rap was a cool kind of like"

01:09:04;01:09:06;"""That's fun, but you know, what's up next?"""
01:09:06;01:09:09;"Like people not understanding what's a trend"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"versus what is like the new way of looking at the world."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"And yet, but so there was this feeling of like,"

01:09:15;01:09:18;"That was like Christmas '81 was all about the Atari,"

01:10:04;01:10:09;"I did stumble across an article about the video game crash of 1983"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"Jake, before we get to the great video game crash of 1983"
01:10:12;01:10:19;"Matt just found something that he sent to Seinfeld which is kind of like a third strike for Nolan Bushnell"
01:10:19;01:10:26;"So not only was he kicked off the Atari board and then he missed out on owning a third of Apple"
01:10:26;01:10:33;"It turns out that his connection to Pixar is not just the vague Steve Jobs connection in children's entertainment"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"It goes even a little deeper. So check this out. What was just unearthed?"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"Yeah, so Bushnell was one of the people behind a company called Cadaveroscope"
01:10:41;01:10:45;"which was a very early attempt at computer animation"
01:10:45;01:10:52;"That company was then sold to Lucasfilm which ultimately became Pixar"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Damn"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"That's even funnier that he knew Steve Jobs personally"
01:10:56;01:11:05;"but this like other, I guess like company/portfolio of computer animation technology he helped develop"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"ended up backing Jobs' hands later"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"meaning that he missed out on owning a third of Apple"
01:11:10;01:11:14;"and in a weird way he kind of like almost missed out on being part of Pixar"
01:11:14;01:11:20;"and apparently his computer animation company, they made a TV movie"
01:11:20;01:11:23;"What was it called? It was about Chuck E. Cheese?"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"It was called Chuck E. Cheese, The Christmas That Almost Wasn't"
01:11:27;01:11:31;"and it was under the subsidiary of the Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theater's company"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"What year was that?"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"'83"
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Oh man"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"I wonder what that animation looked like back then"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"Raw"
01:11:38;01:11:42;"It just looked like the Dire Straits music video"
01:11:42;01:11:46;"Clearly like Nolan Bushnell, he's like a Nikola Tesla or something"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"You know, one of these guys who's just like"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"He did do very well"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"I mean, he used to sell Atari for $28 million in 1977"
01:11:54;01:12:00;"and he did like a ton of other ventures after that that didn't really take off to the same extent"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"He did okay, but it's just like the fact that he"
01:12:03;01:12:07;"as far as like the cushy life of a corporate tech guy goes"
01:12:07;01:12:13;"it's kind of hard knocking that he was lost control of two companies that he helped start"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"and he had these very notable forks in the road"
01:12:16;01:12:20;"and he missed out on being part of something truly gigantic"
01:12:20;01:12:25;"I just mean like in this case, maybe Steve Jobs is like Thomas Edison and he's like Tesla"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"We know the name today, there's a car named after it"
01:12:28;01:12:33;"He still had his very special contributions to science and technology"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"He just didn't quite get to be the electricity guy"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"That's actually this other movie that I've been kind of like"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"that kind of came and went that I was stoked about"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"I don't even remember what the name is, do any of you guys know?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"It basically was like the electricity movie"
01:12:45;01:12:50;"and it's like somebody plays Edison, somebody plays Tesla, and somebody plays Westinghouse"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Is it called like Current Wars?"
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Yeah"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"The Current War?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Tom Holland"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"That's funny"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"Maybe one day when Seth Rogen makes Console Wars the movie"
01:12:59;01:13:03;"we can do a double feature of Console Wars and The Current War"
01:13:03;01:13:09;"But anyway, was there any resolution to this Pasquale's thing?"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Does anybody know?"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"If I could just set the record straight a little bit"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"You know, Pasquale's Pizza and Wings"
01:13:16;01:13:20;"it's not quite the same product as what Chuck E. Cheese sells"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"It's a different pizza, it's got a thicker crust"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"it's got extra sauce, and it's got new blends of cheeses and spices"
01:13:27;01:13:30;"Look at Seinfeld going to the mat for Pasquale's"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Well I just don't like"
01:13:31;01:13:36;"Seinfeld, if you've also been hired to do social media and branding work for Chuck E. Cheese"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"you legally have to tell us"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"I'm just passionate about the brand"
01:13:39;01:13:43;"You picture Seinfeld being like"
01:13:43;01:13:48;"""You know, I have a really interesting portfolio of clients and brands that I work with"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"everything from Chuck E. Cheese to Time Crisis"
01:13:50;01:13:55;"I help maintain those brands, make sure that they have social media presence that grows the brands"""
01:13:55;01:13:59;"But Seinfeld, is that like a press release that Chuck E. Cheese put out that's like"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"""Hold up guys, don't pretend that we're trying to scam people"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"we're giving a different product to you"""
01:14:03;01:14:04;"Yeah, I mean that was"
01:14:04;01:14:08;"I'm paraphrasing a statement made by a representative for Chuck E. Cheese"
01:14:08;01:14:09;"but I stand by it"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"Your gut is that they're good people"
01:14:12;01:14:16;"Well, okay, but this is also something I've been wanting to talk about on Time Crisis for a while"
01:14:16;01:14:19;"and we probably don't have time to go super deep today"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"but the world of food delivery"
01:14:21;01:14:24;"modern food delivery with apps and all this sh*t"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"is bananas"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"It's the wild west, totally insane"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"None of these companies, Grubhub, DoorDash, anybody, Uber Eats"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"is making any money"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"and in fact, I sent you guys this article that I found"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"that's about, like, called ""Pizza Arbitrage"" or something"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"where basically a guy writes about his friend owned a pizza place"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"a real pizza place"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"and they didn't do delivery"
01:14:47;01:14:51;"This guy was like ""I'm not about delivery, I want people to come to my pizzeria and eat the pizza"""
01:14:51;01:14:54;"and he starts getting phone calls at the pizzeria"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"with people being like ""Hey man, I ordered a pizza from you guys"""
01:14:57;01:14:59;"and it showed up really cold"
01:14:59;01:15:03;"and this guy kind of responded by being like ""Well, we don't do delivery, it wasn't us"""
01:15:03;01:15:05;"and basically this guy finds out that DoorDash"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"put his business on their service without asking"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Insane"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"and they put a menu up"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"and, you know, I guess it's legal"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"in the sense that they can just"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"you're paying somebody to go to the pizza place"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"and buy something for you and bring it to your house"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"but there's no coordination"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"so guys are just like rolling up without the"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"thermal pizza bags"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"and just bringing cold ass pizza to people's houses"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"and this guy's like ""I never signed up for this, what is this?"""
01:15:31;01:15:34;"and in fact he realized that DoorDash was even"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"undercutting his own prices"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"he had a pizza that cost 20 bucks"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"and they were selling it on their service for 15 bucks"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"and in this article"
01:15:42;01:15:45;"this guy's friend, who's an economist or something"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"convinced him to see if he could profit by"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"buying his own pizzas via DoorDash for the lower price"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"and pocketing the extra money"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"the whole thing was crazy"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"but basically you realize that all these companies are"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"A) they're not making any money"
01:15:59;01:16:02;"they're kind of going the Amazon model"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"of basically being like ""who will get to own this entire business?"""
01:16:05;01:16:07;"with terrible margins"
01:16:07;01:16:11;"and one day, after losing billions and billions of dollars"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"when all the competitors are defeated"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"and you control the entire food delivery"
01:16:15;01:16:16;"for the world"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"then you could maybe start turning a profit"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"but in the meantime"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"you're giving terrible deals to the restaurants"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"you're paying your workers, your drivers like sh*t"
01:16:26;01:16:27;"with no benefits"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"and it's kind of like this weird thing where nobody's happy"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"but anyway"
01:16:31;01:16:34;"that's one whole aspect of this bizarre world of food delivery"
01:16:34;01:16:35;"which on the face of it"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"obviously"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"time crisis"
01:16:38;01:16:39;"finance talk"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"we don't know what we're talking about"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"I've always been blown away"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"that I understand with like tech stuff"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"people being like"
01:16:45;01:16:49;"""well, you know, like, it's hard to figure out how to monetize Twitter"""
01:16:49;01:16:50;"right?"
01:16:50;01:16:51;"like I get it"
01:16:51;01:16:54;"you're like ""yeah, you got this product, you got millions of people using it"""
01:16:54;01:16:57;"but you can't just start charging people for it"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"like that's not gonna work"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"and ads can get kind of messy"
01:17:01;01:17:02;"I understand that"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"it's like you have this hit thing"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"and people use it"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"but how do you turn Twitter into like a money making machine?"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"I can imagine why that's complicated"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"and I've always thought to myself"
01:17:13;01:17:16;"well, too bad they're not in like a straightforward business"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"like Uber or DoorDash or something"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"where you get paid every single time somebody uses your app"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"like how are those places not making money?"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"maybe some TCA who actually knows what they're talking about"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"would be like ""well, here's why"""
01:17:29;01:17:30;"but in the meantime"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"they're losing loads of money"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"and they're just trying to kind of like"
01:17:33;01:17:37;"hope that they can ultimately just grow so far"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"and so big"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"that eventually they'll be in the black"
01:17:41;01:17:42;"but one phenomenon"
01:17:42;01:17:43;"I don't think we've ever talked about it"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"this might require actually like a fully researched episode"
01:17:46;01:17:51;"one phenomenon that also complicates this whole bizarre ecosystem"
01:17:51;01:17:56;"of restaurants and drivers and apps and customers"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"is the concept of the ghost kitchen"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"and I think I mentioned that on the thread, Jake"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"and you weren't familiar with the ghost kitchen"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"no, it was referenced a few times in that article you sent"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"which was a great read, by the way"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"but I still don't have a handle on it"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"my understanding is basically"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"and for all you know"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"you may have ordered from a ghost kitchen before"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"that people realized"
01:18:17;01:18:20;"okay, these delivery apps"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"they connect customers with restaurants"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"pretty straightforward"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"but at a certain point"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"if there's these restaurants"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"and 90% of their income is delivery"
01:18:30;01:18:31;"why do you even need to be"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"like a public facing restaurant?"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"and some of these apps"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"suddenly have these app only places"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"that only do cauliflower crust pizza"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"or some kind of special burrito"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"because people realize like"
01:18:44;01:18:48;"we don't need to provide the ambience"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"or the seating for an actual restaurant"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"we can literally just be like"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"a weird anonymous kitchen"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"that sends food out"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"and I found some article"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"where somebody in San Francisco"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"found a really dingy ghost kitchen"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"but on the app"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"it's a little bit Chuck E. Cheese vibe"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"that on the app it's billed as like"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"Signore Mario's authentic Italian pizza"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"and then you go and it's literally just like"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"one metal table"
01:19:12;01:19:16;"in like a dystopian fluorescent light"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"it's like Domino's or Papa John's"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"like you don't eat at Domino's or Papa John's"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"it's all carry out or delivery"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"yeah, I guess in the case of those places though"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"people are very familiar with the brand"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"and what it looks like"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"and with the vibe"
01:19:29;01:19:32;"whereas now it's even weirder"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"because people are just kind of like"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"I want pizza"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"and you might just get some sh*t that pops up"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"that's just like Mario's pizza"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"and you're like well I also want Chinese"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"and it's just like Fat Dragon Chinese"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"and literally for all you know"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"they could be the same metal table"
01:19:46;01:19:49;"in a giant industrial kitchen somewhere"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"and that's where you get to me"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"like one step beyond"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"I'm not saying it doesn't make sense"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"but it's a little bit like"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"one step beyond Domino's"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"but so there is something to be said about like"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"it's not like Chuck E. Cheese is like"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"inventing this idea"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"they're probably like"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"well we have a network of kitchens"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"all over the country"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"they're essentially turning"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"Chuck E. Cheese into ghost kitchens"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"in fact I think people like"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"found it really funny to imagine"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"somebody ordering from a place"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"called Pasquale's"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"and just getting a sh*t"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Chuck E. Cheese pizza"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"but it's also like"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"they might as well just start making"
01:20:20;01:20:21;"like other sh*t too"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"yeah"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"you know they can start making like pies"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"I think it is Pasquale's pizza and wings"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"yeah they make wings too"
01:20:27;01:20:30;"did Chuck E. Cheese traditionally have wings?"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"I think so"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"I don't know I can't speak to that"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I'm assuming"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"well Seinfeld have you had Pasquale's pizza"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"and was it noticeably different than Chuck E. Cheese pizza?"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"you know I haven't had it personally"
01:20:40;01:20:44;"but I feel like I understand where they're coming from"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"but no I haven't tasted it myself"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"well we gotta taste it"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"very diplomatic"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"let's see if we can find some for the next episode"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"we all order it to our homes"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"oh my god"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"I think there's another funny thing too"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"where it's like"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"as dystopian as Domino's and Papa John's might be"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"you understand what Domino's pizza tastes like"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"and you understand when you order from Domino's"
01:21:04;01:21:08;"you're getting it from that place called Domino's"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"that you drive past and never go into"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"you understand where it is"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"with some of these ghost kitchens"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"it literally might be the same oven"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"the same kitchen"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"the same place"
01:21:18;01:21:23;"that's billed as four or five different establishments"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"you know like for instance"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"let's say you're a closed"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"I'm not saying that they went this far"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"but this would be like the ghost kitchen way of doing things"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"let's say that you're a closed Chuck E. Cheese"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"and you say to yourself"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"nobody wants to buy Chuck E. Cheese pizza"
01:21:38;01:21:39;"but they might want to buy Pasquale's"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"which as Seinfeld said"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"has a thicker crust"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"what else?"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"more spices"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"a variety of spices"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"it's really an elevated version"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"zestier"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"for sure zestier"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"so maybe they decide that"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"Pasquale's pizza and wings that works"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"they could also say"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"but you know what"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"the oven's only at half capacity"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"even with the Pasquale's orders"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"why don't we create a cut above Pasquale's"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"that's called"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"you know"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Neapolitan Arcade"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"or something like that"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"and at Neapolitan Arcade"
01:22:11;01:22:14;"it's actually the price point's a little bit higher than Pasquale's"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"but it's a really nice thin crust pizza"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"and it has nicer cheese"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"and it's got"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"bougier toppings"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"like you get a prosciutto pizza there"
01:22:22;01:22:23;"and so then you open the app"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"and you see like"
01:22:24;01:22:25;"Chuck E. Cheese"
01:22:25;01:22:26;"you're like nope"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Pasquale's be like"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"what's up with this place?"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"look at the menu, not for me"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"and then you see like"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"Neapolitan Arcade"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"and you're just kind of like"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"oh"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"and maybe they choose a picture"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"to put as their banner up top"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"that kind of makes it look like a hipster place"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"and you're like oh prosciutto"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"I'll get it"
01:22:41;01:22:42;"and for all you know"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"it's like the exact same person"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"just be like"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"oh we got an order for"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"we got a Neapolitan"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"alright can you grab me the thin one"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"and you just put it in next to the big sh*t pizza"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"I think stuff like that's happening"
01:22:57;01:23:07;"[coughing]"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"you know I don't really like how"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Chuck E. Cheese"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"you're sort of mischaracterizing them"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"as having not a lot of integrity"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"but Pasquale is actually a member"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"of Munch's Make Believe band"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"which is part of the Chuck E. Cheese IP"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"and I feel like it's not like"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Chuck E. Cheese was trying to like"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"you know lie to the public or anything like that"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"they're not trying to pull the wool"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"this is all part of the Chuck E. Cheese"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"they're very transparent about it"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"and uh just"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"wait so Pasquale is"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"he's part of the Chuck E. Cheese universe"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"he's a member of"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"what's it called the Make Believe band?"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"Munch's Make Believe band"
01:24:24;01:24:25;"but who's Munch?"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"is it Munch apostrophe?"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"like the Make Believe band belongs to Munch?"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"so Munch's Make Believe band"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"is an animatronic band"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"that's featured at all Chuck E. Cheeses"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"and have been there since 1989"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"what kind of music do they play?"
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Same year as Pump"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"they play a variety of different"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"you know genres"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"I feel like it's like a Huey Lewis-esque mix"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"of rock and R&B"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"it's very wholesome"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"it doesn't ever get nasty"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"they flirted with getting a little bit nasty"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"after they heard Blood Sugar Sex Magic"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"for the first time"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"but ultimately they knew"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"you know that's not us"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"we can't get nasty like that"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"corporate shut that down"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"no they're known for playful pop rock"
01:25:05;01:25:08;"and they do Chuck themed covers of hit songs"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"they actually do a version of"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"The Vapors turning Japanese"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"the 1980 hit song"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"they do their own take on it"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"and what instrument does Pasquale play?"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"he's the pizza guy"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"so he just"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"it looks like he just hangs out"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"he's kind of a hype man?"
01:25:25;01:25:26;"oh wait no no no no no no"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"okay Pasquale's the drummer"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"he's like the Bob Nisdanovich"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"of Spank"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"just holding it down"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"Bob Nisdanovich was like the second drummer"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"he was like the hype man"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"second drummer of Pavement"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"and there's a guy in the Mighty Mighty Boss Duns"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"who just danced right?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"yes exactly"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"maybe that's like Pasquale"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"I can imagine somebody from Chuck E. Cheese"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"when the story blew up"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"just being like are you guys f***ing stupid?"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"it's called Pasquale's"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"do you think that that's"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"in some way trying to obfuscate"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"the connection to Chuck E. Cheese?"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"I mean if Disney"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"opened a place called"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"Donald Duck Pizza"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"would you think they're trying to hide"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"something? Are you f***ing stupid?"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"It's Pasquale"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"of course it's Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"affiliated. If somebody opened"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"a Captain America"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"themed restaurant, would you be shocked"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"to understand that it's connected to the Avengers?"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Are you f***ing stupid?"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"yeah don't blame Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"for your own ignorance. If you know Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"you know Pasquale, you know what he does"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"and you know that there's no lie there"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"there's no untruth being told"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"that's super like Kellyanne Conway"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"just coming out guns blazing"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"to talk to the press and just being like"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"okay first of all for you to imply"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"that Pasquale"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"is not part of"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"I mean you hear Pasquale, you first think of Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Pasquale's probably even more famous than Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"are you? Oh my god"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"everyone knows that Pasquale"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"is the Bob Nostanovich of the Chuck E. Cheese"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"band. Everyone knows it"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"[laughter]"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Chuck E. Cheese"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"just hires like a few famous"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"drummers to kind of do a PSA to get them"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"out of hot water like Ringo is just like"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"now listen"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"us drummers, we're the heartbeat of"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"the whole band and I can't tell you"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"there are many times that people"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"would talk about me as if I"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"you know I wasn't at the same level as"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"Paul and John but you know there's no Beatles without"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"Ringo and I gotta say Pasquale"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"he's my brother"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"peace and love"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"peace and love, give Pasquale a chance"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"I think Pasquale, he's got two jobs"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"right? He's making pizza"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"and wings and he's also drumming in a band"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"what's more relatable than that?"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"Yeah. You know? Gig economy"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"man of the people"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I also like too"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"that they chose Pasquale because"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"in bands in the past"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"you know when you think of like John Bonham"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"or Keith Moon there's this idea"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"that the drummer is this kind"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"of like party animal"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"less refined kind of character"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"you know when you think of those"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"real classic rock bands"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"driving their car into the pool"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"partying harder you know and I like the"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"fact that with Pasquale"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"they said no no no that stereotype"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"of drummers being the wild"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"ones of the group that's very"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"ignorant. Pasquale actually"
01:28:16;01:28:18;"when he goes into the kitchen to make pizza"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"he makes something more refined"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"and elegant than Chuck E Cheese"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"the front man. Yeah he's like the Neil Peart"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"Yeah exactly"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"he's very bookish and actually by the way"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"Pasquale writes the lyrics"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"[laughter]"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"So guys Matt just shared me"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"on the Pasquale bio"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"and you know Pasquale's got actually"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"quite a back story. His full name is"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"Pasquale P. Pieplate"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"and he's from Naples, Italy"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"shortly after his birth his parents"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"Priscilla and Petro immigrated to"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"America where they opened Pasquale's"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Pizza which they named after him"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"just a little bit more"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"growing up Pasquale isolated himself"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"from sports and other activities to study the"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"art of pizza making hoping"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"to one day inherit his parents store"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"he also taught his"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"younger sister Paola"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"everything he learned about pizza"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"[laughter]"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"This is so epic"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"but also"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"did they create this back story last week?"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"This is unbelievable"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Was this always"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"part of Chuck E Cheese's lore or did they"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"create this entry last week to kind of"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"explain why Pasquale's"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"was this online pizza"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"I have an answer for that. Could you imagine"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"that they were thinking"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"holy sh*t we gotta really backtrack"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"here. We gotta paper over this"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"[laughter]"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"I also just love the idea"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"too of being like to really"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"emphasize why Pasquale's"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"is different than Chuck E Cheese and to be like"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"listen Pasquale ended up"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"kind of coming into the"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"fold with the Chuck E Cheese crew"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"and joining Munch's Make Believe band"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"that was as a drummer"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"but you gotta understand something"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"performing night after night in this kind"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"of corporate American pizzeria"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"environment that was really hard"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"for an Italian immigrant whose"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"parents made real Neapolitan"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"pizza so every"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"night Pasquale"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"he's wailing away on the drums but he's looking out at these kids"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"eating this dog sh*t American pizza"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"and you know as an Italian"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"that was painful for him on a"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"cultural level and he"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"always said to Chuck E can't we"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"make the pizza a little bit better"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"I can't get down with this sh*t. Chuck E always brushed"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"him aside so the COVID"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"19 pandemic really"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"allowed him to finally have"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"the time away from drumming"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"to kind of get in the kitchen"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"and create a pizza that was up to"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"his standards and"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"listen if"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"any members of the press are also"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Italian immigrants with a"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"story like that by all means"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"raise your hand but I think"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"the rest of us should probably"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"check our privilege and let Pasquale"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"do what he wants to do"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"as an immigrant drummer"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"There's a dark side to Pasquale's"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"story. Oh no."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"After his parents split up"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"and settled in America, Pasquale"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"gained full control of their restaurant"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"Determined to not only attract"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"customers through pizza but also through"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"entertainment, he performed live stand-up"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"comedy, recruited his nephew Gino"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"to help make pizzas, and added"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"arcade games as a mainstay"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"However his plan backfired due to"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"the negative reception of his jokes"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Faced with a slow decline"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"of customers, Pasquale"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"intended to close the restaurant but"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"a surprise encounter with a singing"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"mouse began to bring in more"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"customers, prompting Pasquale"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"to rename his restaurant"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Chuck E. Cheese's after his new star"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"and he and Chuck E. Cheese"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"remained friends ever since. So he's the founder"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"of Chuck E. Cheese. Pasquale's the brains of the operation"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Yeah. Chuck E. Cheese"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"is just the front man. Okay but it still"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"stands that Pasquale's an Italian immigrant"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"who links up with this"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"American guy and then next"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"thing you know they're this big"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"mainstream rock act"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"and children's pizza joint"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"Pasquale's is kind of, if he was a musician"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"this is like his back to basics album"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"You know this is Bono being like, ""Listen, at the"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"end of the day, we're just a couple Irish"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"kids who love punk rock"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"and this song is dedicated to Joey Ramone."""
01:32:16;01:32:18;"Or the Rolling Stones being like"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"""Listen, we're just still those kids"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"who love collecting blues records."""
01:32:22;01:32:24;"Okay so Pasquale's got an interesting story"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Can I also just sort of say"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"something that's kind of obvious, which is"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"that this is psychotic"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"that there's no story"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"of Pasquale"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"There's no TV show"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"or anything, they literally had"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Seinfeld, where are you reading this?"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"This is Wikipedia?"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"This is the Chuck E. Cheese"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"fandom page, the sub-wiki"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"of it, the entry under"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Pasquale. I mean"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"I guess this predates the whole scandal, I don't know"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Well clearly there's more"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"than meets the eye to the Chuck E. Cheese universe"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"and maybe should have been called Pasquale's from the start"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"That's what it sounds like to me"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Alright, should we bang out a top 5?"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"It's time for the"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Top 5"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"5 on iTunes"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"This week's"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"top 5, we're comparing"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"the top 5 Billboard hits"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"this week in 1977"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"with the top 5 Apple"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"music songs right now"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"2020. Why"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"1977? Is it because"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"Jake and Kanye were born"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"that year? No, I think you know"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"why, but Jake, tell them"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"in case they forgot"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"I mean, we've been talking about it for about an hour now"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Chuck E. Cheese was founded in"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"1977 in San Jose, California"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"As we"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"go through these hits of 1977"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"we can kind of imagine"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"that we're watching"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"the Leonardo DiCaprio"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"Nolan Bushnell"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"biopic, and this is the soundtrack"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"So the number 5 song"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"this week in 1977"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Marvin Gaye, ""Got to Give It Up"""
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Let's take a listen"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"And I guess this is a live version"
01:34:04;01:34:10;"Or maybe this is kind of like a fake live"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"version"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"It's like ""What's Going On"" had that sort of"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"synesthetic, like fake crowd"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"This song was a response to a request"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"from Gaye's record label that he performed"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"disco music"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"Right, kind of disco, but"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"such a good song"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"And this is infamously the song"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"that Blurred Lines"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"was inspired by"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"and the Gaye estate sued"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"Robin Thicke and Pharrell and all those people"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"What happened"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"with that lawsuit? Who won that?"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"The Marvin Gaye's family did"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"I mean, it's very similar"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"It's similar, but as I've said before"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"they're different songs"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"At some point, you shouldn't be able to copyright"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"buy"
01:34:52;01:34:58;"I don't know any musicians who really like that"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"decision"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"because I think people just felt like"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"nobody's even defending Blurred Lines or anything"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"or being like, no, Blurred Lines is original"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"because it's not about that"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"You just don't want to be in positions when"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"people play me sh*t all the time"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"like, ""Yo, doesn't this sound like Vampire Weekend?"""
01:35:14;01:35:16;"And I've always been kind of like"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"""Eh, maybe"""
01:35:18;01:35:20;"I think that the common elements that we maybe put together"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"or something that we didn't own in the first place"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"the idea that somebody does it"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"if they change it enough"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"I kind of feel like if somebody does something"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"that's obviously egregiously inspired"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"by something else"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"the price they should have to pay is just kind of like"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"embarrassment"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"Like, ""Alright, I see what you're going for"""
01:35:38;01:35:40;"You're doing like a pastiche"

01:35:42;01:35:44;"""Oh, those are pretty similar"""
01:35:44;01:35:46;"But then, when they can't prove that the melody's the same"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"or the bassline's the same"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"the thing that always kind of kills it for me"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"is when you actually see the legal language"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"and I've seen this for other"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"lawsuits like this"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"where somebody will describe what the infringement is"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"and so their lawyer has to put that into writing"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"and sometimes it'll be like"

01:36:14;01:36:16;"So I understand why"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"and I think they were even on record as being like"

01:36:44;01:36:46;"But talk about different vibes"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"It was like 60s Motown"

01:36:54;01:36:56;"Totally different vibes"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Yeah, you could even argue that"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"To me, I always grew up being like"

01:51:38;01:51:40;"specifically sued over"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Tom York's bridge melody."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"It basically is ""The Air That I Breathe."""
01:51:44;01:51:46;"Da-na-na-na-na-na-na."

01:51:52;01:52:02;"Bees"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"came up on me"

01:52:08;01:52:10;"made me breathe."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Although, you know, once you have"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"the same chord progression, it's natural"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"that different minds might go to some of the same"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"places in the scale."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"I feel like that's the same chord progression"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"as ""Lay, Lady, Lay,"" too."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"It's like A,"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"C-sharp, major, D, right?"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"Right, yeah, the major third."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"It's a classic move, because it's"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"outside the key. It's surprising"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"a little bit. It's like a nice moment to get that"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"major third, because you expect a minor third"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"kind of. The number two"

02:01:22;02:01:24;"As. - Oh, huge"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"songs. And then you even get to the album"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"tracks and I think you have like Pastime"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"Paradise which became... - Oh yeah,"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"the Coolio song? - Yeah,"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"unbelievable. - Yeah. - And the number"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"one song on Apple Music"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"today, DaBaby featuring"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"Roddy Ricch, and Jake you're not gonna believe this,"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"Rock is officially not played out"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"because that number one song"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"on Apple Music right now"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"is called Rockstar."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"- I feel like there's like a song called Rockstar"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"every like two years. - Accurate."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"- Wasn't there a Post Malone song called Rockstar? - Yeah, and then"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"way before that was Party Like a Rockstar."
02:02:02;02:02:04;"- Wait, have we heard this before?"
02:02:04;02:02:06;"Maybe I heard it."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"- I don't think so."
02:02:30;02:02:32;"- Well, I think this is a very"
02:02:32;02:02:34;"good song. The only disappointing thing is that"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"it's called Rockstar and you hear"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"from the first note it's a guitar."
02:02:38;02:02:40;"It's not really a rock guitar. It's kind of like"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"it sounds like a Spanish nylon. I mean, I'm listening"
02:02:42;02:02:44;"through earbuds. - Yeah. - It kind of sounds more"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"like a Spanish nylon guitar."
02:02:46;02:02:48;"I associate that sound more with"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"obviously Spanish music and"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"also 90s R&B."
02:02:52;02:02:54;"You know, it'd be very easy for them to remix"
02:02:54;02:02:56;"the song and replace that kind"
02:02:56;02:02:58;"of mellow, sweet"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"Spanish acoustic sound"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"with kind of an overdriven"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"more like Eddie Van Halen tone."
02:03:04;02:03:06;"[Mimics Eddie Van Halen]"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"On those arpeggios, that would make it a little more rock."
02:03:08;02:03:10;"- That'd be very cool."
02:03:10;02:03:12;"- The producer's name is Seth in the Kitchen."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"All one word."
02:03:14;02:03:16;"I wonder what Seth in the Kitchen's backstory is."
02:03:16;02:03:18;"- Nickelback had a"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"song called Rockstar, too."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"- Wow. Was that like a hit?"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"Single? - That was a big song."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"- It's funny. In the 20 years"
02:03:26;02:03:28;"since rock entered"
02:03:28;02:03:30;"its kind of Borghese and post-modern"
02:03:30;02:03:32;"death knell period,"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"there's been a lot of hit songs"
02:03:34;02:03:36;"called Rockstar, very of which"
02:03:36;02:03:38;"are by rock bands"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"except for Nickelback and even"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"they are kind of controversial in the rock community."
02:03:42;02:03:44;"You ever consider this?"
02:03:44;02:03:46;"That maybe rock is not played"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"out, but it is dead. You know what I mean?"
02:03:48;02:03:50;"- They're just like putting"
02:03:50;02:03:52;"the EKG - Or the opposite."
02:03:52;02:03:54;"- like electric thing on the chest."
02:03:54;02:03:56;"- Well, it's like Marilyn Monroe's"
02:03:56;02:03:58;"dead, but she's still"
02:03:58;02:04:00;"apparently her estate generates"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"hundreds of millions of dollars a year because"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"she's such an iconic figure."
02:04:04;02:04:06;"People want to buy stuff. Elvis is dead, but"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"he's not played out."
02:04:08;02:04:10;"Alexander Hamilton is dead. There's a"
02:04:10;02:04:12;"hit Broadway musical about him."
02:04:12;02:04:14;"Maybe rock did die, but it's"
02:04:14;02:04:16;"actually not as played out as people think."
02:04:16;02:04:18;"Or maybe it is played out,"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"but it's not dead. And that's what you have"
02:04:20;02:04:22;"to tell rock fans. Listen, guys,"
02:04:22;02:04:24;"it's true what you've heard. Rock is played"
02:04:24;02:04:26;"out, but it's not dead. It's alive."
02:04:26;02:04:28;"It just ain't pretty."
02:04:28;02:04:30;"Maybe that's some people got to"
02:04:30;02:04:32;"face the facts, you know?"
02:04:32;02:04:34;"Anyway, this is a good place to wrap it up."
02:04:34;02:04:36;"Finally got back to the top five."
02:04:36;02:04:38;"Shout out to Pesqually and the whole"
02:04:38;02:04:40;"Make Believe band. We'll be back"
02:04:40;02:04:42;"next week. Good talking to everybody."
02:04:42;02:04:44;"See you soon."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"- Time Crisis with Ezra"
02:04:46;02:04:48;"Koenig."
