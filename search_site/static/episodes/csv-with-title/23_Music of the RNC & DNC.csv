00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back in LA."
00:05;00:09;"I'm joined once again by my co-host Jake Longstreth."
00:09;00:15;"As we survey the terrain of American politics and culture,"
00:15;00:20;"we talk about the music of the DNC and the RNC."
00:20;00:23;"We revisit a special moment in Eagles history."
00:23;00:28;"Plus, we count down the hits of 2016 and 1992."
00:28;00:34;"This is Time Crisis with Ed Sprung King."
00:34;00:38;"Beats 1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"They were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:21;"Jake, what's up man?"
01:21;01:25;"Hey, episode 29."
01:25;01:26;"Really?"
01:26;01:27;"No, I don't know."
01:27;01:29;"We're definitely in the 20s."
01:29;01:31;"I was in the studio all day today, man."
01:31;01:33;"You seem wiped."
01:33;01:37;"I'm wiped, but I'm going to bring it for this Time Crisis."
01:37;01:39;"Because the world's in trouble, man."
01:39;01:40;"It's heavy."
01:40;01:41;"Streets are hot."
01:41;01:43;"Streets are very hot."
01:43;01:44;"Oh man."
01:44;01:48;"Well, before we get into all that, obviously the world is a horrible place."
01:48;01:50;"Everybody's having a real tough time."
01:50;01:52;"A lot of bad things happening."
01:52;01:55;"But at least there's some good news."
01:55;01:59;"If you recall, a couple of Time Crises ago,"
01:59;02:05;"we were talking about Smash Mouth and how Steve Harwell--"
02:05;02:06;"Is that his name?"
02:06;02:07;"I have no idea."
02:07;02:10;"The singer from Smash Mouth, he was getting in a lot of fights"
02:10;02:16;"because a lot of kids on Twitter were using internet humor to bully him"
02:16;02:21;"and imply that their only hit song was All Star."
02:21;02:24;"And also implying that All Star was only a hit song because of Shrek."
02:24;02:27;"So they're hitting him from both sides."
02:27;02:32;"As anybody who likes music knows, Smash Mouth had more than one hit,"
02:32;02:37;"and anybody with even a cursory knowledge of music history"
02:37;02:41;"is also aware that All Star was a hit song before it was used on the Shrek soundtrack."
02:41;02:46;"So anyway, we were imploring the kids to stop bothering him"
02:46;02:49;"because you shouldn't use social media to bully people."
02:49;02:51;"Especially your elders."
02:51;02:54;"But anyway, so finally some good news from the Smash Mouth camp."
02:54;03:01;"They got a new song, and this one is a collaboration with an EDM artist."
03:01;03:03;"Do you know what EDM is, Jake?"
03:03;03:04;"Yeah."
03:04;03:05;"What is it?"
03:05;03:07;"Electronic dance music."
03:07;03:10;"All right. All right, man."
03:10;03:13;"They collaborated with an EDM artist called Spectre."
03:13;03:14;"That's Visionary."
03:14;03:16;"I'm not familiar with him."
03:16;03:19;"And honestly, it works."
03:19;03:22;"You'll hear some of the hallmarks of modern radio EDM,"
03:22;03:25;"but you'll also hear just like that classic Smash Mouth delivery."
03:25;03:28;"That distinctive Smash Mouth sound."
03:28;03:30;"And the song is called ""Love is a Soldier,"""
03:30;03:36;"and I know that a lot of people are going to want to use Internet humor to diss this song."
03:36;03:39;"You know what? And that bothers me because I'm a musician."
03:39;03:42;"I know that every time I put music out, the haters,"
03:42;03:45;"they're not listening to it with open ears."
03:45;03:46;"They're looking for something to hate,"
03:46;03:48;"and I know the Smash Mouth has the same issue,"
03:48;03:51;"but hopefully people have learned their lesson."
03:51;03:53;"So anyway, this is what it sounds like."
03:53;03:59;"So it's cool because that bass line right there, the chord progression,"
03:59;04:02;"it's got that late '90s Smash Mouth vibe."
04:02;04:04;"But then the drums, there's like an extra kick."
04:04;04:06;"You know what I'm saying?"
04:06;04:08;"Hold on, hold on."
04:08;04:14;"That's the same singer?"
04:14;04:16;"Yeah."
04:16;04:20;"Come on, that sounds like him."
04:20;04:21;"Getting a little bit there."
04:21;04:23;"They mixed the vocals down a little bit."
04:23;04:26;"He's singing like an octave lower than he used to."
04:26;04:30;"People get older, voices change."
04:30;04:34;"Oh, here we go."
04:34;04:42;"""Love is a soldier."""
04:42;04:47;"Who is this for?"
04:49;04:54;"I can't imagine this is going to please OG Smash Mouth fans."
04:54;05:00;"Here it comes. We're building up."
05:00;05:06;"Sick, guys."
05:06;05:08;"I think technically this is the drop."
05:08;05:10;"It's a Smash Mouth drop."
05:10;05:15;"Imagine these guys listening to the playback in the recording studio."
05:15;05:17;"Yeah, man."
05:17;05:19;"I think it's okay."
05:19;05:22;"I'm not lying, man."
05:22;05:24;"Here's the thing."
05:24;05:28;"Are you familiar with the phrase?"
05:28;05:31;"""You can't always get what you want."""
05:31;05:35;"No, I was going to say the phrase, ""The narcissism of small difference."""
05:35;05:36;"I love that phrase."
05:36;05:39;"Me too. I've been thinking about it a lot."
05:39;05:43;"As I mercilessly hate on people similar to me."
05:43;05:48;"For those of you who don't know, ""narcissism of small difference"" is a phrase from Freud."
05:48;05:54;"Some psychologist basically says the ego acts up the most not when the people are very different from us,"
05:54;05:57;"but when the people are just a little bit different from us."
05:57;05:59;"You don't hate the person a million miles away from you."
05:59;06:01;"You hate the person right next to you who is very similar to you"
06:01;06:05;"because it triggers your own feelings of insecurity or worthlessness or something."
06:05;06:09;"So anyway, people hate on Smash Mouth."
06:09;06:10;"Have you listened to that?"
06:10;06:16;"Is it a million miles away from a lot of the music on the radio that people are falling all over themselves to like?"
06:16;06:21;"Narcissism of small differences is a fascinating concept, and there's a lot of truth to it."
06:21;06:27;"But there's a flip side to that, which would be you are in a position to actually evaluate this music"
06:27;06:30;"because you are so close to it, because they are a peer of yours."
06:30;06:34;"If you're listening to Cambodian pop from the '60s,"
06:34;06:41;"that's not a context that you could listen to that music and evaluate with the same level of expertise."
06:41;06:44;"So it cuts both ways."
06:44;06:46;"I know what you're saying."
06:46;06:55;"You're saying because Smash Mouth are quite obviously the ideological forebears of Vampire Weekend,"
06:55;06:57;"at least in the music world."
06:57;07:02;"I'm in a unique position to have commentary on what they do."
07:02;07:06;"Is this your way of saying that your next album is going to be pretty EDM intensive?"
07:06;07:09;"I mean, honestly, it would be a smart move."
07:09;07:11;"It'd be a shrewd move."
07:11;07:13;"It would end our friendship."
07:13;07:18;"Really? You wouldn't be friends with me if I got Calvin Harris to produce the album and I had drops on it?"
07:18;07:20;"Absolutely not."
07:20;07:21;"Are you serious?"
07:21;07:25;"Yes. Yes. Yes, I'm serious."
07:25;07:29;"Man, first of all, I like EDM."
07:29;07:33;"And if in fact the next album is very EDM influenced,"
07:33;07:39;"it's not going to be because I'm just trying to get fat checks, get that Smash Mouth money."
07:39;07:45;"If the next album is EDM influenced, it's going to be because I went out to the desert"
07:45;07:50;"and I looked into my soul and I found that what I wanted to put on my music"
07:50;07:55;"was the hallmarks of modern radio pop."
07:55;07:56;"Not for the money."
07:56;07:58;"You shroomed out in the desert."
07:58;08:01;"I shroomed out in the desert and I came back and it sounded like this."
08:01;08:03;"You met your creator."
08:03;08:06;"You did some deep spiritual soul searching."
08:06;08:10;"I like this part. It's got acoustic guitar."
08:10;08:16;"Going down."
08:16;08:19;"Is this that different than Calvin Harris and Rihanna?"
08:19;08:22;"No, that's exactly my point."
08:22;08:24;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
08:24;08:30;"These dudes are clearly trying to just pander to stay ""relevant."""
08:30;08:33;"I just had a thought. I'm sure this is not an original observation,"
08:33;08:38;"but without the narcissism of small difference, capitalism falls apart, man."
08:38;08:40;"That's true, dude."
08:40;08:42;"I just dropped some heavy shit on you, man."
08:42;08:43;"You just dropped some knowledge."
08:43;08:44;"Because think about it, man."
08:44;08:45;"Dude, we're going Buddhist again."
08:45;08:48;"Yeah, we're going Buddhist again because think about it, man."
08:48;08:53;"If we didn't narcissistically look for every small difference"
08:53;08:56;"and really pounce on the small difference between us and the next guy,"
08:56;09:00;"then what difference does it make if you're wearing a plaid shirt from Saint Laurent"
09:00;09:02;"or a plaid shirt from Target?"
09:02;09:04;"Or if you're drinking Coke or Pepsi."
09:04;09:05;"Exactly."
09:05;09:07;"Or eating Del Taco or Taco Bell."
09:07;09:10;"Although Coke is better than Pepsi, man. Let's keep it real."
09:10;09:12;"This is a pro-Coke show."
09:12;09:14;"Yeah. I know what you--"
09:14;09:15;"No, no, but exactly."
09:15;09:17;"Your larger point stands, dude."
09:17;09:21;"It's like when you go into CVS or Walgreens--"
09:21;09:24;"shout out to Walgreens. They're my sponsor."
09:24;09:28;"When you go into CVS or Walgreens and you're looking through the body washes"
09:28;09:33;"and you're going to decide which body wash you want to wash your body with,"
09:33;09:35;"you can't go in there and look at the Old Spice"
09:35;09:39;"and then look at the Neutrogena Heavy Duty Just for Men"
09:39;09:43;"and be like, ""It's all the same. Who cares? Let me buy the cheapest one."""
09:43;09:44;"Because if you just--"
09:44;09:45;"That's how I roll."
09:45;09:46;"Really?"
09:46;09:47;"Yep. But anyway, finish your point."
09:47;09:49;"That's the type of consumer you are."
09:49;09:52;"If everybody just went in and bought the cheapest one,"
09:52;09:55;"then how would the luxury brands make money?"
09:55;09:59;"I buy the store brand. I buy the Rite Aid version or whatever it is."
09:59;10:01;"What about with food?"
10:01;10:02;"What's an example?"
10:02;10:06;"I guess at Costco, their home brand is Kirkland."
10:06;10:11;"Kirkland makes everything from sneakers to peanuts to frozen pizza."
10:11;10:13;"Would you like a Kirkland frozen burrito?"
10:13;10:14;"No."
10:14;10:17;"But I'm not buying frozen burritos at Costco."
10:17;10:18;"Why not?"
10:18;10:22;"I live in LA. I don't need to buy frozen burritos."
10:22;10:24;"There's great burritos down the street."
10:24;10:28;"All right. So bottom line, the new Smash Mouth song is great."
10:28;10:32;"Everybody I saw writing about it wrote about it with an air of skepticism."
10:32;10:35;"I mean, dude, I get where you're coming from of like,"
10:35;10:37;"""Look, these guys have been in the game for a long time."
10:37;10:39;"It's so lame of us to come out and hate."""
10:39;10:42;"Rolling Stones went disco, and that was a great song."
10:42;10:46;"Maybe in 1978, we would have heard that and been like, ""These sellouts."""
10:46;10:51;"No, exactly. If there was Twitter in 1978 and the Rolling Stones dropped ""Miss You,"""
10:51;10:54;"it would have been like, ""Oh, you're so lame."""
10:54;10:55;"Yeah, maybe."
10:55;11:00;"I don't think that we're going to be listening to that Smash Mouth song in 40 years, though."
11:00;11:02;"You never know, though."
11:02;11:04;"It's not a reason to not do something."
11:04;11:05;"Right."
11:05;11:12;"If all you do is make decisions in life so that your name will ring out in eternity,"
11:12;11:14;"you're missing out on the little things."
11:14;11:15;"Right."

23:15;23:19;"And honestly, it casts a cloud over everything we do."
23:19;23:20;"You know what I mean?"
23:20;23:24;"When was the last time that you did something and you really felt free"
23:24;23:27;"from the specter of this coming election?"
23:27;23:29;"Took a dump."
23:29;23:32;"And you were just on a hire plane?"
23:32;23:33;"Yep."
23:33;23:34;"What were you thinking about?"
23:34;23:37;"I was reading a book about the making of Murmur."
23:37;23:38;"You took a book into the bathroom?"
23:38;23:40;"I keep books in the bathroom."
23:40;23:41;"That's disgusting."
23:41;23:42;"Bathroom book, dude?"
23:42;23:43;"Pretty standard."
23:43;23:46;"Please don't tell me that you take your phone into the bathroom."
23:46;23:47;"Absolutely."
23:47;23:48;"Are you kidding me?"
23:48;23:49;"No."
23:49;23:52;"Obviously, we don't want to go too deep into this disgusting topic."
23:52;23:54;"But listen, you should never take your phone into the bathroom."
23:54;23:55;"There's germs in there."
23:55;23:56;"You might drop it in."
23:56;23:59;"I know so many friends that drop their phone in the toilet."
23:59;24:00;"Ugh!"
24:00;24:01;"Ew."
24:01;24:06;"When I'm at a restaurant and maybe I'm there with an untrustworthy dining companion"
24:06;24:10;"and I have to use the restroom, I will bring my phone to the maitre d'."
24:10;24:12;"Because you know they have that little podium."
24:12;24:16;"And I'll say, ""Sir or madam, I need to use the restroom."
24:16;24:20;"Of course, I don't want to take my phone and will you please hold this for me here?"""
24:20;24:21;"That's what I do."
24:21;24:24;"I don't believe that you should take any devices into the bathroom"
24:24;24:27;"unless you count an electronic toothbrush."
24:27;24:30;"I think taking a D is perfect time for Instagram."
24:30;24:31;"Oh yeah."
24:31;24:32;"Honestly, if--"
24:32;24:34;"That's what I do most of my Instagramming is when I'm taking a D."
24:34;24:35;"Oh my god."
24:35;24:40;"I can't believe that you dragged the discourse down to this level, man."
24:40;24:43;"You should never take any devices into the restroom."
24:43;24:44;"It's full of germs."
24:44;24:45;"What would Trump think?"
24:45;24:47;"I could imagine him doing that."
24:47;24:52;"There's people who take iPads, laptops into the restroom."
24:52;24:53;"That's pushing it."
24:53;24:56;"I don't even take devices into the kitchen."
24:56;24:57;"Well, good for you, man."
24:57;24:58;"All right, man."
24:58;25:00;"Like, same team."
25:00;25:02;"Let's do another 10 minutes on--"
25:02;25:03;"Same team."
27:19;27:36;"So anyway, the specter of politics haunts everything that's happening."
27:36;27:40;"I've found it very hard to go on social media lately."
27:40;27:41;"Yeah, it's exhausting."
27:41;27:42;"It's exhausting."
27:42;27:43;"It's brutal."
27:43;27:44;"I can't stand the fighting."
27:44;27:49;"I mean, but, you know, like, on one level, I'm glad that people are fighting, getting their opinions out there."
27:49;27:52;"But so much of it just seems, like, misguided."
27:52;27:57;"It's like the big thing now, because, you know, we had the RNC, but then we had the DNC."
27:57;28:03;"So with the DNC, the big thing is, like, why won't these hardcore Bernie supporters just shut up?"
28:03;28:07;"And look, you know that I was out there campaigning for Bernie as you were."
28:07;28:09;"Like him, like what he stands for."
28:09;28:10;"I'll vote for Hillary."
28:10;28:13;"Of course it's more important that Trump's not president."
28:13;28:18;"But yet, when I hear about somebody whose conscience tells them not to vote for Hillary,"
28:18;28:23;"I would gently suggest that they vote for her, especially if they live in a swing state."
28:23;28:26;"I do find it hard to get indignant about it."
28:26;28:27;"You know what I mean?"
28:27;28:33;"Just to, like, get up in the grill of some real lefty socialist and just be like, ""Vote against your conscience, you idiot."""
28:33;28:34;"You know what I mean?"
28:34;28:36;"I feel the temptation to do that."
28:36;28:37;"To be like, ""You're an idiot."""
28:37;28:39;"I don't do it, but I do feel the temptation."
28:39;28:45;"I agree with you that it's cool that the Bernie people are there at the convention involving themselves and participating."
28:45;28:48;"But I think it's also lame to boo people."
28:48;28:49;"Oh yeah, well I think it's lame to--"
28:49;28:54;"I think when, like, Elizabeth Warren is speaking and they're booing her, it's like, ""Okay, you guys are morons."
28:54;28:57;"You're making it too emotional and about yourself."""
28:57;28:59;"I agree that you shouldn't boo anybody."
28:59;29:00;"Yeah."
29:00;29:01;"Well, I don't know."
29:01;29:02;"Booing is rude, period."
29:02;29:07;"But you know, also, like, another thing I've been thinking about is democracy is fundamentally unpleasant."
29:07;29:08;"You know?"
29:08;29:09;"Real."
29:09;29:15;"I feel like when we were kids, we were pledging allegiance to that flag, talking about civics and history,"
29:15;29:24;"and there was kind of this idea that in other countries that have dictators and fundamentalist regimes,"
29:24;29:27;"but in America we have democracy, so life is great."
29:27;29:29;"So there's this idea that democracy is a pleasant thing."
29:29;29:33;"But just because a thing is just doesn't mean it's pleasant."
29:33;29:34;"You know what I'm saying?"
29:34;29:35;"Yeah."
29:35;29:39;"You know, you watch, like, Question Time, you watch the British Parliament, and they're yelling at each other."
29:39;29:40;"Yeah."
29:40;29:41;"It wasn't always funny."
29:41;29:46;"Like, America, we're supposed to be the raw dummies, but our Senate, people don't yell at each other."
29:46;29:49;"You have, like, things here and there, but over there they yell at each other."
29:49;29:51;"So, you know, a fight is not pleasant."
29:51;29:53;"An ideological dispute is not pleasant."
29:53;29:54;"So I don't know."
29:54;29:57;"It's just hard for me to get really up in arms about--"
29:57;30:03;"Say you're somebody and you really feel like the DNC is not following through for your issues."
30:03;30:04;"I don't know."
30:04;30:07;"But, dude, it's not about your issues."
30:07;30:13;"This is what drives me crazy is that let's say you want Bernie or you want Jill Stein,"
30:13;30:17;"and then you're up there being like, ""It's fine for you to express your opinion,"
30:17;30:22;"but don't cry about it and boo people because you're--"""
30:22;30:24;"Okay, talk about the narcissism of small differences."
30:24;30:25;"Right."
30:25;30:33;"Just because your exact criteria of the platform isn't being met doesn't mean you should be able to boo."
30:33;30:34;"I think it's like--"
30:34;30:36;"Free speech, man."
30:36;30:37;"No, I agree with you."
30:37;30:39;"I think it's rude to boo."
30:39;30:43;"What's the cliche that politics is the art of the possible?"
30:43;30:44;"Oh, I don't know. I've never heard that."
30:44;30:45;"Well, that's what it is."
30:45;30:46;"At the end of the day--"
30:46;30:47;"You play the hand you're dealt."
30:47;30:49;"It's a realist game."
30:49;30:50;"Right."
30:50;30:54;"And so you get to this level, the choice is narrow, and that's it."
30:54;30:55;"I know."
30:55;30:56;"I do feel bad for people, though, who--"
30:56;30:57;"I don't--"
30:57;30:59;"I do feel bad for the idealists."
30:59;31:00;"I don't."
31:00;31:01;"You don't feel bad for them?"
31:01;31:03;"I agree with them, but I don't feel bad for them."
31:03;31:04;"Time to move on."
32:42;32:47;"If you want to burn a lot of calories going out there for Jill Stein, be my guest."
32:47;32:53;"But if Trump wins, that's going to be the biggest setback for any progressive agenda you might have for decades on end."
32:53;32:54;"I agree with that 100%."
32:54;32:56;"Trump cannot win."
32:56;32:58;"Well, then stop playing with yourself."
32:58;32:59;"What?"
32:59;33:01;"[laughter]"
33:01;33:03;"I mean, but, okay, Trump cannot win, but--"
33:03;33:06;"You can't always get what you want."
33:06;33:08;"It's true, you can't always get what you want."
33:08;33:09;"Well, look, we could talk in circles."
33:09;33:11;"I guess the bottom line, people should be nice to each other."
33:11;33:13;"You can express your opinion without booing."
33:13;33:14;"Yeah."
33:14;33:16;"Booing's lame, so is crying."
33:16;33:17;"Also, I think--"
33:17;33:18;"Although that was whack."
33:18;33:21;"Everybody hating on these poor people, like, crying."
33:21;33:25;"There was, like, this meme of making fun of these, like, Bernie supporters who had tears in their eyes at the DNC."
33:25;33:26;"Uh-huh."
33:26;33:27;"That's funny to me."
33:27;33:29;"It's funny that people cry?"
33:29;33:30;"It's a little bit."
33:30;33:32;"Wow, you're like Donald Trump over here, man."
33:32;33:33;"Hell no, bro."
33:33;33:34;"[laughter]"
33:34;33:43;"All right, well, anyway, one thing that will definitely unify the party is a cover of the best song of the past 10 years, in my opinion."
33:43;33:47;"I've been on record advocating for this song time and time again."
33:47;33:48;"Interesting."
33:48;33:51;"Because as everybody knows, I don't express my real opinions on this show."
33:51;34:01;"So I've been out here advocating for one of the best songs that we've been listening to in the top five over the past year, however long we've been doing this."
34:01;34:03;"You know what song I'm talking about?"
34:03;34:04;"Fight song."
34:04;34:11;"It's a song by a girl named Rachel Plantains, and it's a--I guess you would--you call it a power ballad in a way."
34:11;34:12;"Yeah, it is kind of a power ballad."
34:12;34:13;"Yeah."
34:13;34:15;"This is my fight song, take back my life song."
34:15;34:18;"And it's a song that's already spoken to a lot of people."
34:18;34:27;"And I think the Democrats are like, well, we need a song to get people psyched because, you know, this is an important election."
34:27;34:32;"So they got Elizabeth Banks, who is a very talented actress, writer, and director."
34:32;34:35;"She most recently directed Pitch Perfect 2."
34:35;34:36;"You see that, Jake?"
34:36;34:37;"No."
34:37;34:38;"I saw it."
34:38;34:39;"I was."
34:39;34:40;"Great."
34:40;34:41;"Did you see Pitch Perfect 1?"
34:41;34:42;"No, never even heard of it."
34:42;34:43;"Oh, you're kidding me."
34:43;34:44;"No, I'm kidding."
34:44;34:45;"I live in L.A."
34:45;34:46;"I've seen the billboards."
34:46;34:47;"Okay."
34:47;34:48;"I've seen the billboards, and I'm like, what is that?"
34:48;34:49;"It's cool."
34:49;34:50;"It's about acapella."
34:50;34:56;"So basically, she directed this thing where they got her and a bunch of other celebrities"
34:56;35:00;"to do an acapella, like, YouTube-style video where, like, you see everybody singing all the parts."
35:00;35:01;"Okay, let's watch it."

38:22;38:23;"You know I'm going to vote for Hillary."
38:23;38:24;"Yep."
38:24;38:27;"And I do prioritize beating Trump and the Republicans"
38:27;38:28;"above all."
38:28;38:29;"Mm-hmm."
38:29;38:33;"But that said, the Democrats mess up so much, man."
38:33;38:34;"They depress me."
38:34;38:37;"I hate seeing a song that's made me feel"

38:46;38:48;"it just feels like propaganda."

38:50;38:52;"I don't think the Democrats are bad people at all."
38:52;38:54;"That video feels chintzy."
38:54;38:56;"But maybe we're just being narcissists"

38:57;38:58;"Maybe, yeah."
38:58;38:59;"Maybe we're just being a hater."
38:59;39:00;"Maybe that's the theme of the show."
39:00;39:02;"Well, to me, the irony of celebrity involvement"
39:02;39:05;"with that kind of stuff is that we value celebrities"
39:05;39:09;"in our lives because they offer an escape from reality, right?"
39:09;39:10;"Yeah."
39:10;39:12;"And then all of a sudden, they're--"
39:12;39:15;"even though I didn't know anyone in that video was--"
39:15;39:17;"so it's even worse because they're like taking the poise"
39:17;39:18;"of being celebrities."
39:18;39:20;"But let's say I did recognize people in that video."
39:20;39:22;"Then they would be like injecting themselves"
39:22;39:25;"into reality, which is not where I want them."
39:25;39:26;"They're breaking the fourth wall."
39:26;39:28;"They're breaking the fourth wall."
39:28;39:29;"Everybody's entitled to their opinion."
39:29;39:31;"And I really do have to, you know,"
39:31;39:33;"say shout out to everybody who participated in that video"
39:33;39:35;"because those people are being out there,"
39:35;39:38;"being a little silly to support a cause."
39:38;39:42;"I guess what I'm saying is like using the power of music"
39:42;39:44;"and specifically the power of ""Fight Song"""
39:44;39:49;"by Rachel Plantains to support a fundamentally--"
39:49;39:52;"I don't want to like focus on Hillary because like whatever."
39:52;39:53;"We focused on her enough."
39:53;39:57;"To support a fundamentally flawed platform and party,"
39:57;39:59;"to have this like feel-good song,"
39:59;40:02;"knowing that we're up there supporting a group of people"
40:02;40:04;"who have caused misery and suffering"
40:04;40:08;"for people in this country and around the globe."
40:08;40:09;"You know what I mean?"
40:09;40:11;"You're saying that they have to win,"
40:11;40:12;"but we shouldn't support them."
40:12;40:13;"I mean, no, I get it."
40:13;40:16;"You can support a flawed group of people."
40:16;40:18;"Everybody deserves sympathy and support,"
40:18;40:22;"but to bring in the purity of music"

42:46;42:48;"- Let me ask you this. - Yeah?"
42:48;42:50;"- Maybe this is too real. - All right."
42:50;42:55;"- You lent your good name... - [laughs] True."
42:55;42:59;"- And your outstanding songwriting skills to Bernie Sanders."
42:59;43:02;"- Yeah. - Now, what if someone at Hillary's campaign was like,"
43:02;43:05;"""Hey, Ezra, we saw that you supported Bernie."
43:05;43:07;"""We're reaching out from Hillary's campaign."
43:07;43:10;"""We're putting together a show. Ed's on board."""
43:10;43:12;"[laughter]"
43:12;43:14;"- It's gonna be Grizzly Bear... - Got Ed from Grizzly."

43:16;43:18;"- We're talking about some of the Titans in the..."
43:18;43:21;"- Jane's addiction. I don't know. - Jane's addiction. All right."
43:21;43:24;"- And we want Vampire Weekend to play the show."
43:24;43:28;"It's gonna be in mid-October, a few weeks before the election."
43:28;43:31;"It's gonna be in Ohio, an important battleground state."
43:31;43:34;"- Ugh. - It would mean a lot if Vampire Weekend came out"
43:34;43:37;"or a Vampire Weekend Dirty Projector supergroup came out."
43:37;43:40;"- Hillary personally requested it. - Yeah, whatever."
43:40;43:43;"I'm not saying Hillary calls you on the phone, but I'm saying her campaign."
43:43;43:45;"- Hmm. That's an interesting conundrum,"
43:45;43:48;"because when it comes to lending my vote"
43:48;43:51;"and encouraging the people around me to vote, no problem."
43:51;43:53;"- Yeah, that's nothing. - Getting on stage..."
43:53;43:56;"- What if it's neck and neck, dude? It's mid-October."
43:56;43:59;"It's just like, Trump's two points ahead of Clinton in Ohio."
43:59;44:02;"- Oh, man. - He's got Michigan in the bag."
44:02;44:06;"- Well, I would be concerned that I wouldn't be enthusiastic enough"
44:06;44:09;"and I might be like, ""You got the wrong guy."""
44:09;44:11;"Like, I was out there for Bernie."
44:11;44:14;"I clearly have an element of my support that's begrudging,"
44:14;44:17;"and I don't want to put myself out there and mess things up for you."
44:17;44:20;"- Don't be a narcissist, dude. Serve your country, man."
44:20;44:23;"- So you're basically-- - It's not about you, man."
44:23;44:26;"- Right. And they were like, ""Get out there and be enthusiastic,"
44:26;44:29;"'cause if you don't--"" - Play ball, dog, 'cause we need you."
44:29;44:32;"- Even if I'm like, ""But I'm worried I won't be enthusiastic,"""
44:32;44:35;"they're just like, ""But get out there and be enthusiastic."""
44:35;44:39;"Because it positions me and Vampire Weekend as being incredibly important."
44:39;44:41;"- Well, you are. - Oh, well, thank you."
44:41;44:45;"- To 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds, no one over that."
44:45;44:48;"Let's just establish that."
44:48;44:52;"- OK, but putting that aside, putting aside the narcissism"
44:52;44:54;"of Vampire Weekend's place in the world,"
44:54;44:56;"let's just pretend that it was really important."
44:56;44:59;"- Yeah. - And I was actually being encouraged to do this."
44:59;45:02;"That's an interesting one, man, because that--"
45:02;45:05;"You know what I thought the other day? This is another one of my little"
45:05;45:07;"random thoughts. - Mm-hmm."
45:07;45:09;"- In the past, I might have put this on Twitter,"
45:09;45:12;"but my revulsion causes me not to."
45:12;45:14;"I was thinking about this, man."
45:14;45:18;"Sometimes, to not be a hypocrite, you gotta be a hypocrite."
45:18;45:20;"You know what I'm saying?"
45:20;45:22;"- That's deep, dude. - [laughs]"
45:22;45:24;"I know, man. You know what I'm saying?"
45:24;45:30;"What I play the show, I guess if me getting on stage"
45:30;45:33;"and rocking hard for Hillary, if what you're saying's true,"
45:33;45:36;"if that would stop Trump from being president,"
45:36;45:39;"I would have to do it, because if I didn't do it,"
45:39;45:42;"then all those things that I'm talking about would be even worse."
45:42;45:44;"- They'd be set back for your lifetime, dude."
45:44;45:46;"- They'd be set back for a lifetime. - Trump would appoint"
45:46;45:48;"at least two Supreme Court justices."
45:48;45:53;"You could kiss any hope of overturning Citizens United goodbye."
45:53;45:56;"- I'd have to be pragmatic, and I'd also have to recognize"
45:56;45:59;"the fact that the people who have the hardest time in this country"
45:59;46:02;"who are getting screwed by the Democrats and the Republicans,"
46:02;46:04;"I'm not really one of them. You know what I'm saying?"
46:04;46:08;"So I would have to put aside my ideological privilege."
46:08;46:10;"- What song are you going to play at the Hillary show?"
46:10;46:14;"- At Hillary's show? - This is my fight cover."
46:14;46:16;"- I guess I would get up there. I'd have to do a cover."
46:16;46:18;"- You and D-Lo covering ""Fight Song""?"
46:18;46:20;"- Honestly, it would be an honor if Rachel Plantains would join me."
46:20;46:23;"- Along with Meghan Trainor? - Along with Meghan Trainor,"
46:23;46:26;"who we--I forget if I like her or not, but whatever."
46:26;46:28;"I like everybody."
46:28;46:30;"- You're right, man. I would have to get up there"
46:30;46:34;"and rock out for Hillary because also,"
46:34;46:38;"there's a lot of pro-Hillary people who I think,"
46:38;46:41;"in the way they've talked about Bernie and his supporters,"
46:41;46:45;"have been truly immoral, abysmal, hateful people."
46:45;46:49;"The way people talk about socialism and some of the things he stands for,"
46:49;46:52;"but again, sometimes you've got to partner up"
46:52;46:54;"with mean-spirited, hateful people."
46:54;46:56;"That's what life's all about, right?"
46:56;46:59;"- I don't know if life's all about that, but--"
46:59;47:02;"- And that's why I'm proud to announce"
47:02;47:05;"my new sponsorship from the Frito-Lay Corporation."
47:05;47:07;"I'm their new global ambassador."
47:07;47:10;"They've made some mistakes. It's true."
47:10;47:13;"Anyway, that's enough about the DNC."
47:13;47:16;"Thank you for challenging me ideologically, Jake."
47:16;47:21;"It's important to have people in your life who keep it real with you."
47:21;47:25;"I don't think Hillary needs me or Vampire Weekend particularly,"
47:25;47:29;"but definitely in my personal life and on my radio show,"
47:29;47:31;"probably not on Twitter,"
47:31;47:35;"I will certainly encourage people in swing states"
47:35;47:38;"to defensively vote. Vote against Trump."

01:06:31;01:06:33;"At least it's an ethos."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Exactly."
01:06:35;01:06:41;"And then the final song that they closed out the RNC with was the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
01:06:41;01:06:43;"This is a funny one."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Very confusing."
01:06:45;01:06:51;"I think logically it was going through either Trump's head or the RNC programmer's head."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"Okay, we're going to close it out."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"The theme is ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Who is that directed at?"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Is that directed at the national viewing audience?"
01:06:59;01:07:03;"And also, was it definitely Trump's decision?"
01:07:03;01:07:11;"Did Trump's campaign manager be like, ""Donald, any song you want to close out the RNC, what do you want to play when you're done talking?"""
01:07:11;01:07:15;"And he was like, ""Rolling Stones."""
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Rolling Stones?"
01:07:17;01:07:25;"To me, the most logical interpretation is that that's Trump saying to the Republicans, the Ted Cruz Republicans, who are still not supporting him,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"That's ninja."
01:07:27;01:07:35;"""Hey guys, you can't always get what you want. You wanted Ted Cruz. You wanted a real Christian."
01:07:35;01:07:41;"But if you try sometimes, if you actually get out there and vote, you might get what you need."
01:07:41;01:07:49;"And what you need is a pseudo-religious, adulterating, strong man."""
01:07:49;01:07:53;"I think that's what he's literally trying to say to those fringe Republicans who still don't have his back."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"Get in line, dudes. You can't always get what you want."
01:07:55;01:08:00;"I know. Obviously, here, we're a lot of bleeding heart liberals."
01:08:00;01:08:09;"But if we put ourselves in the shoes of a Republican, maybe you do have some real questions about, ""Is Trump a family values candidate?"""
01:08:09;01:08:13;"Say that's important to you. And he's got a message for you. You can't always get what you want."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"But what do you want, Hillary?"
01:08:14;01:08:19;"That's interesting. So instead of directing the song towards the national viewing audience that might be on the fence,"
01:08:19;01:08:23;"He's directing it toward the hardcore base of the party."
01:08:23;01:08:29;"Well, you know what? As Elizabeth Warren keeps saying, ""Trump seems to be very thin-skinned."""
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Right."
01:08:30;01:08:35;"And when you're a thin-skinned person, any hater will set you off."
01:08:35;01:08:41;"Whether it's a Democrat, a Republican, a friend, an enemy. You know what I'm saying?"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"We've all encountered people like this in our lives."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"That is beyond funny, though."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"You can't always get what you want."
01:08:47;01:08:50;"But you know what's weird, man? I think it's effective for people."
01:08:50;01:08:58;"Because there is this whole thing that's like, ""Hey, he might be a bad man, but at least he keeps it real."""
01:08:58;01:09:01;"Now let's listen to the Rolling Stones. ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
01:16:02;01:16:19;"- All right, Jake, we got a little treat for you today."
01:16:19;01:16:20;"- Okay."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"- Today is July 31st, 2016."
01:16:23;01:16:27;"- Do you know what happened 36 years ago to the day?"
01:16:27;01:16:28;"- So what year would that be?"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"- 1980."
01:16:30;01:16:33;"A major moment in musical history"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"happened on July 31st, 1980."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"- Springsteen released ""The River""?"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"- [Laughs]"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"That's a great guess."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"It involves the Eagles."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- They broke up."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Last show in Long Beach."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"- That's right."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"That's right."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- Played their last show in Long Beach."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"- So for people who don't know,"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"this is a very famous show in the Eagles fan community"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"because it was the last show,"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"but something happened on stage."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- Right."
01:16:57;01:17:00;"- So Glenn Frey and Don Felder,"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"things have been very tense between them,"
01:17:02;01:17:06;"and it boiled right over on stage."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"And you can go back and you can listen"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"to them talking to each other."
01:17:10;01:17:15;"You can hear Frey saying to Don Felder,"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"""Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal."""
01:17:17;01:17:19;"[Laughs]"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"- So some of the most famous soft rockers of the '70s"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"entered the '80s in a pretty brutal way."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- On a harsh toke."
01:17:27;01:17:28;"- They left."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Felder got right in the--"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"one of them just got right in the car,"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"and they peaced out."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- Wow."
01:17:34;01:17:37;"- Last time those guys would share the stage"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"for over a decade."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"- Not even that long."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"- No."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"- Wait, was Felder part of the reunion?"
01:17:44;01:17:45;"I don't think he was."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"- Yeah, no, he was,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"but then they kicked him out again later."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- Okay, okay."
01:17:49;01:17:52;"- And now Glenn Frey is in heaven."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"Rest in peace, Glenn."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"- Mm-hmm."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"- But, you know, for Eagles fans,"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"that was really famous."
01:17:57;01:18:01;"I mean, imagine if you saw a famous band today"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"just, like, talking to each other on stage."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Just meltdown."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"- Imagine if you saw Harry Styles"
01:18:07;01:18:11;"saying to one of the other guys in one direction"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"on stage at a show somewhere,"
