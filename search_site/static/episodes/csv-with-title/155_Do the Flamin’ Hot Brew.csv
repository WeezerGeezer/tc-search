00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis, back again. On this episode we talk about the Eagles in China, the"
00:10;00:24;"Burger King, Chicken, Seal, Beach Boys, TLC and so much more. This is Time Crisis with"
00:24;00:31;"Ezra Koenig."
01:11;01:17;"Time Crisis, back again. The boys are back in town. Now I guess for the listeners it's only been two"
01:17;01:21;"weeks but for us we used to banked up last week so this is it's been a while."
01:21;01:28;"Long time no. When I got on it sounds like Jake you were trying to remember if"
01:28;01:33;"you knew anything about that episode. Oh yeah I have zero recollection of the"
01:33;01:37;"bank episode. I remember we talked about Neil Young. Yeah there's some Neil Young"
01:37;01:42;"talk. Jake do you remember what your soul movie is? I don't even remember, no."
01:42;01:47;"What a soul movie is? What is that? That's weird how little I remember. A soul movie"
01:47;01:53;"if I recall correctly is the movie that was number one at the box office on your"
01:53;01:58;"10th birthday. Hmm. Seinfeld is that correct? I mean per Time Crisis that's"
01:58;02:02;"the definition of a soul movie. Yeah that's that's how we did it. Do you even"
02:02;02:07;"remember having this conversation Jake? Very vaguely. Somebody's soul movie was"
02:07;02:12;"Platoon. I remember that. Probably mine then. That kind of makes sense."
02:12;02:16;"Oh yeah because that's probably like 87 that sounds right. Yeah. It's fine that"
02:16;02:19;"you don't remember the episode but just one thing that we uncovered is that"
02:19;02:24;"there is a mandate similar to the vaccine mandate that you have to watch"
02:24;02:28;"your soul movie by the end of this calendar year and that comes straight"
02:28;02:32;"from Joe Biden. Again doesn't matter if you forgot the episode but Joe Biden said"
02:32;02:37;"every American citizen vaccinated or unvaccinated he honestly doesn't give a"
02:37;02:41;"sh*t. Either way you have to watch your soul movie by the end of the year so"
02:41;02:44;"anyway just make sure you throw in Platoon sometime in the next four and a"
02:44;02:48;"half months. I'm happy to do that. You got a good one. That's your soul movie"
02:48;02:56;"brother. Brother that's your soul movie. Do you remember what year it was? It's wild to me how"
02:56;03:00;"little I remember of episodes. People will bring things up like that bit on"
03:00;03:06;"that show and I'm just like what show? I don't remember that at all. What show? I do a show."
03:06;03:10;"I always tell people when they ask me about doing time crisis I said anything"
03:10;03:15;"you do bi-weekly it's just like the the subtlest imprint. Mm-hmm. You know it's"
03:15;03:19;"just like just enough to forget it exists. Well but we also taped that show"
03:19;03:24;"like what a good six eight weeks ago. This one is particularly deep. All bets are"
03:24;03:28;"off. Any conversation I've had over a month ago is like I'm unlikely to be"
03:28;03:32;"able to recall that. I really can't remember my soul movie. I feel like Nick's was Black"
03:32;03:38;"Rain. That is deep. The Michael Douglas movie. What was my soul movie? It was D2 the"
03:38;03:44;"Mighty Ducks. Oh okay I'll watch that by the end of the year. Listen Jack you got"
03:44;03:48;"to watch your soul movie. Okay and same goes to anybody listening and anybody"

03:56;03:59;"birthday that's your soul movie. Joe Biden says you have to watch it. It's"
03:59;04:06;"more important than getting vaccinated. Just go go go go. Run. Do not walk. Live"
04:06;04:12;"Nation AEG just announced that you can't go to any Goose shows unless you've seen"
04:12;04:19;"your soul movie and you can't fake the card. It's very official. You're gonna have to"
04:19;04:25;"take a quiz. If you want to go see shout out to Goose they just did a festival and"
04:25;04:30;"I also just read that they're putting up their first arena show in Connecticut."
04:30;04:36;"Oh where? The Mohegan Sun arena. Is that outdoors or indoors? That's a good"
04:36;04:40;"question. I guess it's part of the whole Mohegan Sun casino complex but anyway"
04:40;04:45;"any Connecticut Jam band heads if you want to go to that show you need to see"

05:16;05:20;"How's this gonna work? You can't control people like that. It infringes on our"
05:20;05:23;"civil liberties. I've heard all the arguments but here's the thing with"
05:23;05:27;"lightning-fast internet which they're gonna have at most venues each"
05:27;05:32;"interrogation session takes about a minute. They pull up the Wikipedia page"

07:51;07:56;"to get through I mean first of all rest in peace to Charlie Watts. Yep. That's a"
07:56;08:01;"sad one. Yep. The one and only drummer of the Rolling Stones. Yeah I guess he Mick"
08:01;08:08;"and Keith were the only guys to play on all the records. Right yeah wow the three"
08:08;08:14;"amigos just a great drummer with a with a light touch excellent feel. A dapper"
08:14;08:20;"gentleman. And a dapper gentleman. I mean a nice counterpoint to the wild rock and"
08:20;08:25;"roll excess of Mick and Keith. I mean if he was also kind of like a Keith Moon"
08:25;08:30;"kind of John Bonham wild man. No totally yeah and he famously like wasn't as into"
08:30;08:35;"partying as everybody else and. Yeah. Just a mellow dude with a light touch."
08:35;08:41;"Everyone throw on side two of Tattoo You just vibe out. Interesting call you know"
08:41;08:44;"I actually it went through my mind I was like oh should we make like a Charlie"
08:44;08:46;"Watts playlist and I was like people just gotta go listen to whatever"
08:46;08:50;"Rolling Stones they want it's yeah also he because he wasn't a flashy drummer"
08:50;08:53;"it's not like there's some songs are just like oh dude you know there's no"
08:53;09:01;"like when the levy breaks. Yeah. Or like oh there's a 10 minute solo um what's on side two of Tattoo"
09:01;09:06;"You is that with like heaven. It's got worried about you. It's got a take you to"
09:06;09:12;"the top. It's got waiting on a friend. Oh beautiful song. It's just this like all"
09:12;09:15;"five songs kind of just like blend together in this really cool way. It's"
09:15;09:21;"just like this chill kind of minimalist vibe. It's a very kind of unique"
09:21;09:27;"little palette that they touched on briefly and I don't know that's my go-to"
09:27;09:33;"if I'm throwing on stones I'm throwing on side two of Tattoo You. Side two."
09:33;09:38;"I don't need to hear start. Oh yeah no it does have heaven I love that song."
09:38;09:46;"Is that really vibe one? Oh yeah. Like kind of like psychedelic like 80"
09:46;09:50;"psychedelic oh yeah that is a great side oh yeah and to end the album with"
09:50;09:54;"waiting on a friend. Waiting on a friend is top five stones for me. Yeah cause side one"
09:54;09:57;"there's a couple like kind of like boogie numbers that you know I don't"
09:57;10:02;"need I don't need start me up but like side two is just all like they're not"
10:02;10:07;"ballads per se but they're sort of this like kind of mid-tempo like chill"
10:07;10:13;"minimalists stone. It's like a weird period. A lot of people say that that was"
10:13;10:19;"that Tattoo You is their last great album. Yeah. Although I think there is good"
10:19;10:23;"stuff after there. Tattoo You is maybe their last like just classic album that"
10:23;10:27;"produced like a big hit single like start me up and also like cool songs."
10:27;10:33;"Yeah I'm pretty into mixed emotions they're single off steel wheels. Not"
10:33;10:40;"familiar. Alright let's throw on mixed emotions. Mixed emotions from like '89."
10:40;10:47;"That's a classic Watts groove right there."
10:51;10:56;"I was really into this when when this was a new single when I was a kid. Were"
10:56;11:03;"you like seeing it on MTV? Yeah. Wow. I was like surprised with myself that I"
11:03;11:08;"would like this new stone song. Chorus is just great."
11:11;11:36;"Got some rare harmonies for the Stones. They don't really do like two-part"
11:36;11:41;"harmony on a chorus very often. Keith comes in a lot on the chorus like. Yeah I"
11:41;11:45;"feel like he comes in to like give a little emphasis on like the third verse"
11:45;11:50;"of the song or something. Yeah that is a good. Just like straight up like two-part"
11:50;11:52;"on the chorus."
11:58;12:16;"I like this idea that you're surprised that you were into a new Stone single"
12:16;12:20;"because I feel like you would have been 12 when this came out. So you're just like at"
12:20;12:25;"the lunch table like middle school just be like guys call me crazy but the new"
12:25;12:29;"Stone single is actually pretty good. I know we haven't been getting a lot of"
12:29;12:33;"like excellent work from any of the 60s dudes. Certainly not since Tattoo You"
12:33;12:37;"but I would say this is some of their best work in years. You already had that"
12:37;12:41;"kind of like just rock fan feeling. Yeah no I think like you know in the late 80s"
12:41;12:46;"I was sort of like I knew who the Stones were but they were a 60s band in my book."
12:46;12:50;"That's a sophisticated understanding for a 12 year old. I was like why would I"
12:50;12:56;"like this? You know it's like I was into like Motley Crue and like Def Leppard"
12:56;13:02;"and stuff and I liked like Ruby Tuesday and some of the like 60s singles. I don't"
13:02;13:07;"think I really liked the like 70s stuff yet. That came later. Interesting. But just"
13:07;13:10;"from like either my parents record collection or just like the classic rock"
13:10;13:15;"radio or the oldies radio I was into like their poppier 60s stuff and I just"
13:15;13:19;"remember being like yeah I mean these guys are old. Right. Why would I like this?"
13:19;13:24;"I felt the same way when in the 90s when people started loving those Bob Dylan"
13:24;13:29;"records like Time Out of Mind and I was like I'm not gonna listen to that."
13:29;13:34;"Yeah but I'm just saying like at least by the 90s you were like in your teens"
13:34;13:39;"or 20s. I'm just saying you were young to even have a conception of like this is"
13:39;13:44;"an old band putting out new material which is generally considered treacherous"
13:44;13:48;"territory and even though I'm into more of the current wave of American hair"
13:48;13:53;"metal I do really respect. I'm just picturing like a little 12 year old"
13:53;13:57;"like American psycho just like hey dad have you heard the new Stones single?"
13:57;14:03;"Like what? You're just like I gotta say that it's some of their best works and"
14:03;14:08;"some girls. Now yes I am more interested in a lot of the music coming out of LA"
14:08;14:13;"or England at this point or some of the English new wave but I gotta say the"
14:13;14:16;"Stones hold their own. They're just a classic band. It's a back to basic sound"
14:16;14:21;"just like I think this is excellent work. Easily their best singles since Start Me Up."
14:21;14:26;"I gotta say dad Mick kind of lost his way in the mid 80s. The attempted"
14:26;14:31;"solo career, the Harlem Shuffle cover. I wasn't feeling it but this proves that"
14:31;14:34;"there's still more gas in the tank with the Stones. Best singles since Start Me Up"
14:34;14:40;"and you can quote me on that. Anyway I'm going to school. Have a good day at work."
14:40;14:48;"My dad just turns to my mom we need to call a psychologist. Stat. Can I talk to"
14:48;14:56;"you? Jake's really into like the new Stones single that's very strange. Just a"
14:56;15:01;"little more housekeeping. On the TC text thread we were remembered that during"
15:01;15:05;"Pride Month Burger King made a big announcement that they were gonna donate"
15:05;15:11;"a bunch of money to I don't even remember Seinfeld remind me about this"
15:11;15:15;"what was the Burger King they had a new sandwich called the Chick King and they"
15:15;15:19;"were kind of trolling their biggest competition Chick-fil-a which is the"
15:19;15:24;"biggest chicken sandwich in America because Chick-fil-a notoriously in the"
15:24;15:29;"past has given money to anti LGBT hate groups even though they claim they're"
15:29;15:33;"done with it a lot of people are skeptical Chick-fil-a organization says"
15:33;15:36;"that's in the past we don't mess with that stuff anymore but people are"
15:36;15:40;"skeptical and Burger King was sticking it to them saying hey if you want to"
15:40;15:44;"support a non-homophobic chicken sandwich try the Chick King they put"
15:44;15:48;"their money where their mouth was they said they were gonna give what was the"
15:48;15:53;"promotion yeah so on June 3rd of this year a Burger King tweeted the hashtag"
15:53;16:01;"Chick King says LGBTQ+ rights during hashtag Pride Month even on Sundays and"
16:01;16:06;"then the eyes looking to the left emoji your chicken sandwich craving can do"
16:06;16:12;"good we are making a donation to HRC that's human rights campaign for every"
16:12;16:17;"Chick King sold BK will contribute 40 cents to the human rights campaign"
16:17;16:22;"brackets max donation 250 K I forgot about that aspect that they made a"
16:22;16:26;"little joke about even on Sundays yeah that's getting kind of spicy because I"
16:26;16:30;"bet there probably are some Christian people who say I don't like this"
16:30;16:35;"anti-LGBT bullsh*t but I do respect the closed on Sundays elements and now"
16:35;16:40;"they're getting in the closed on Sundays thing it would also I'm also just"
16:40;16:46;"picturing an alternate universe where rather than get into the hate stuff"
16:46;16:50;"Burger King was like hey we got a new chicken sandwich and guess what you can"
16:50;16:53;"get it on Sundays we're doing a promotion for the first month of the"
16:53;16:57;"Chick King for every Chick King we sell we're donating a dollar to the atheists"
16:57;17:04;"foundation of America hashtag God isn't real like whoa shots fired from Burger"
17:04;17:09;"King really coming for the Chick-fil-a organization Burger King on their social"
17:09;17:14;"media announced that God isn't real they're welcoming atheists to come"
17:14;17:18;"through and they're saying please come on Sunday it's just another day okay"
17:18;17:21;"interesting move I'm surprised that corporate approved that one I mean talk"
17:21;17:25;"about false idols right like Burger King is the new God essentially I feel like"
17:25;17:28;"that's what they'd be maybe implying I mean Burger King is basically saying"
17:28;17:33;"that they're like the John Lennon of fast food that's right and even the"
17:33;17:39;"Burger King this character this guy with this giant head this kind of hubristic"
17:39;17:44;"you know what's a burger a burger is meat so essentially it's a meat King"
17:44;17:49;"it's saying that the kind of spiritual realm the energetic spiritual realm"
17:49;17:54;"which is where the true king of the universe resides they're saying that"
17:54;18:00;"doesn't exist they're saying all that exists is in meat meat King you think"
18:00;18:04;"about Adam and Eve Garden of Eden you know God creating Eve out of the rib of"
18:04;18:09;"Adam I feel like there's a parallel to be drawn from Burger King creating a new"
18:09;18:14;"God from the from the meat of the land meat of a cow the meat of a cow yeah no"
18:14;18:18;"it's very good point and they're also saying that by having this name Burger"
18:18;18:22;"King they're saying meat is all there is they're saying that there's no soul"
18:22;18:27;"essentially the soul doesn't exist the soul doesn't exist we're just meat that"
18:27;18:32;"moves around heavy stuff guys heavy stuff that would be funny if a fast food"
18:32;18:36;"chain really did double that like just went that way I mean honestly we're all"
18:36;18:42;"just meat you have human or a cow you're just meat on a skeleton there's not all"
18:42;18:47;"there is you're a meat puppet you're a meat puppet the bolt goes into your"
18:47;18:55;"brain the lights go out you're done cows have no souls and neither do you they're"
18:55;19:00;"taking on vegans Chick-fil-a organized religion all at the same time I don't"
19:00;19:05;"buy it personally that's an uphill battle from a marketing perspectives I"
19:05;19:09;"mean there's a lot of people there like what their rational materialists they"
19:09;19:14;"don't believe in a soul they believe we're all meat puppets okay"
19:14;19:16;"Burger King"
19:32;19:36;"but anyway so Burger King they were doing a whole campaign they're trying to take down"
19:36;19:41;"Chick-fil-a with the Chick King we talked about it a bunch and it kind of popped"
19:41;19:45;"in my head again I and I thought I wonder how that went and so Seinfeld"
19:45;19:49;"when we first asked you to go check in on how many Chick Kings were sold how"
19:49;19:52;"much money got donated was there anything in the media about it that was"
19:52;19:57;"the frustrating part about it that there was a lot of reporting on the initial"
19:57;20:02;"tweet and the and the offer and a lot of fanfare about ooh you know Burger King"
20:02;20:07;"you know clapping back Chick-fil-a giving the money all the you know the"
20:07;20:11;"right thing and then now here we are at the end of August a month out from the"
20:11;20:16;"end of pride and not a single report and I'm telling you I scoured the internet I"
20:16;20:22;"went 10 pages deep on Google I'm talking like a deep scour here and you know I"
20:22;20:26;"gotta say I gotta hold these food publications to account because you know"
20:26;20:32;"Bon Appetit where were you on this eater right grub street food network like"
20:32;20:36;"where were you on this where you can just report on ooh you know you can"
20:36;20:39;"anybody can say anything and then nobody's gonna follow up so I don't want"
20:39;20:44;"to get all righteous but I feel like TC is really you know doing our due"
20:44;20:48;"diligence here we might be the only news outfit on planet earth who actually"
20:48;20:53;"followed up about this it seems that way um you know I don't want to ruin the"
20:53;20:57;"end of the story but it felt like when we did make contact with the right"
20:57;21:02;"people about this it took a few days to formulate a statement so I think this"
21:02;21:06;"might be a TC exclusive what we're about to reveal here okay so so you actually"
21:06;21:12;"got in touch with Burger King PR I did but I have to also say that I reached"
21:12;21:17;"out initially to HRC because I thought who's gonna be the most honest or the"
21:17;21:21;"most direct about this but the recipient yes right right mm-hmm so I reach out to"
21:21;21:26;"HRC don't hear anything back actually called HRC a few times their press phone"
21:26;21:32;"number goes to a dial tone and so that that sort of went nowhere so somebody"
21:32;21:36;"on the thread had the suggestion to go directly to the source go to BK and you"
21:36;21:40;"know it took a few days but somebody yes somebody in BK sort of corporate comms"
21:40;21:46;"department did did respond and the question was you know was the money you"
21:46;21:50;"know from the chicken initiative actually donated to HRC and I got an"
21:50;21:54;"email from someone named Molly at Burger King and she said see below for a"
21:54;21:59;"statement from Burger King the statement was we are excited to share that the"
21:59;22:05;"sales of the chicken sandwich met the goal and the full 250 K donation has"
22:05;22:10;"been made to HRC on behalf of Burger King well that's great so first of all"
22:10;22:17;"congratulations to Burger King congratulations to all chicken eaters"
22:17;22:23;"who helped raise this money and congratulations HRC but I guess okay so"
22:23;22:26;"just to rewind I think it is a little bit crazy that we're the only news"
22:26;22:30;"outfit that followed up on the story I guess that doesn't reflect poorly on"
22:30;22:37;"Burger King right it more just goes to show that the media they make a big fuss"
22:37;22:41;"about the announcement but they don't want to follow up and they think all"
22:41;22:44;"right we already covered this once who cares that they actually raised the"
22:44;22:48;"money is that fair to say Seinfeld it's the it's the media I would say so I"
22:48;22:52;"think it's also a little curious that Burger King neither Burger King nor the"
22:52;22:57;"HRC thought to issue I mean this seems like classic press release fodder you"
22:57;23:03;"know cause and effect like I'd love to know when that money was donated oh I"
23:03;23:08;"wonder if if they were like oh interesting huh crisis is looking into"
23:08;23:13;"this and that explains the sort of five day long lull between the interesting"
23:13;23:16;"they were like we got went up the flagpole like listen we got Seinfeld"
23:16;23:19;"2000 breathing down our necks just cut the check and they're like but we only"
23:19;23:25;"sold 30 two Kings just cut the check all right the guy in accounting is just"
23:25;23:29;"like I can't make the numbers work the chicken was a flop I can't make the"
23:29;23:33;"work and they're just like you take Whopper money I don't care just cut the"
23:33;23:40;"check all right he could yeah we actually got to open up the books of"
23:40;23:44;"course I believe that they donated the money but I was actually frankly a"
23:44;23:47;"little more curious about how many two Kings they sold well you know it's funny"
23:47;23:51;"that you mentioned that because you know you brought that up and I did actually"
23:51;23:55;"follow up with a friend of the show Molly and I and I said well okay thank"
23:55;23:59;"you and how many two Kings were sold in the month that was probably three four"
23:59;24:04;"days ago no response so I don't know if they're like you're like you're lucky"
24:04;24:08;"that we even said and he acknowledged you I don't know what what the deal is"
24:08;24:12;"or if we'll hear something you know after the show is recorded but but we"
24:12;24:17;"did some number crunching ourselves and we determined that at minimum BK's"
24:17;24:24;"sold six hundred twenty five thousand two Kings if the 40 cents right we"
24:24;24:27;"multiplied the 40 they didn't use Whopper money right exactly if they"
24:27;24:30;"weren't dipping into the Whopper account did they really sell six hundred twenty"
24:30;24:35;"five thousand god I have no concept of that and by the way shout out to Molly I"
24:35;24:40;"know that you probably got a thankless job working in PR I'm just visualizing a"
24:40;24:45;"scenario that's like the White House press room and it's like Jen Psaki is up"
24:45;24:50;"there she sees like Seinfeld and she just looks at you like your Fox News and"
24:50;24:55;"she's like oh my god and you're just like um Jen yeah one question I'm about"
24:55;24:59;"the chicken and she was just like we're dealing with Afghanistan please no more"
24:59;25:02;"questions about your king and just like all the other reporters is like groaning"
25:02;25:07;"you're like um no I think the American people deserve to know I just want to"
25:07;25:11;"say for me and my interest in this story I never doubted that Burger King is"
25:11;25:16;"gonna give 250 grand to HRC that's chump change and they get to write that off"
25:16;25:20;"too so I never doubted that Burger King wouldn't give the money I really was"
25:20;25:24;"just curious about if they would actually sell enough to Kings to make"
25:24;25:29;"that donation according to their own rules I just did a very cursory number"
25:29;25:35;"crunch there's a about 18,000 Burger Kings globally so so to sell six"
25:35;25:40;"hundred thousand sandwiches it's about a little less than 30 sandwiches per"
25:40;25:44;"restaurant pretty do any reasonable pretty do any doable except this is"
25:44;25:49;"probably a US only initiative okay well it's probably I'm not we can look number"
25:49;25:54;"of locations US I'm gonna guess it's well over 10,000 I don't think they have"
25:54;25:58;"two Kings that like Burger King in Germany it looks like there are seven"
25:58;26:03;"seventy two hundred seventy two fifty Burger King locations the US so they"
26:03;26:07;"gotta sell like what 60 or 70 per location yeah that sounds right in a"
26:07;26:13;"month two or three a day yeah come on 2.6 a day per location you know what I"
26:13;26:18;"would really love I would just love to pick a random Burger King somewhere just"
26:18;26:23;"like a Davenport Iowa Burger King yeah and just say guys just just for that"
26:23;26:27;"month can we just see the numbers I just want to see a spreadsheet like a"
26:27;26:32;"Davenport Iowa Burger King during Pride Month is there a day where they sell"
26:32;26:37;"zero to Kings or they pump that they do in like 10 a day I'm just curious like a"
26:37;26:43;"new product obviously there lots of Whoppers lots of fries but they sell a"
26:43;26:46;"lot at the beginning of the month and then it kind of the enthusiasm wanes"
26:46;26:49;"because the word of mouth wasn't good I just want to know that kind of stuff I"
26:49;26:54;"could see that week one hot out of the gates if anybody listening works at a"
26:54;26:59;"Burger King we'd love some just you know anecdotal evidence of like what was that"
26:59;27:03;"month like was it crazy were you getting slammed with chicken requests throughout"
27:03;27:08;"was there a buzz at the location but anyway thank you thank you to Burger"
27:08;27:12;"King for your transparency if you could follow up with the answering the other"
27:12;27:17;"questions we'd love just to know the raw numbers but anyway good for you donating"
27:17;27:20;"the money to the HRC"

29:44;29:49;"think of beer it's our religion our religion is that a real thing it's beer"

31:02;31:08;"novel you can't read it not yet at least well yeah so just mostly a writer and"
31:08;31:14;"then I acted out of convenience you know when I was making my cartoons and stuff"
31:14;31:18;"it was easier to just do the voices then call people or try to track down actors"
31:18;31:23;"so that's how I started acting it's become part of what I do and so Al you're"
31:23;31:30;"a movie producer music promoter and actor yes also I'm a little bird I'm a"

34:49;34:51;"the Eagles or did you actually hit a certain age and you're like you know"
34:51;34:54;"what the Eagles are all right because I feel like a lot of heavy metal dudes"
34:54;35:03;"wouldn't admit that they like the Eagles oh yeah that's a great song I tried to"
35:03;35:09;"bring your band to China a couple of times but really I tried to so hard to"
35:09;35:13;"bring your band to China but what vampire weekend yeah I tried a couple of"
35:13;35:18;"times yeah now you go by the house to the following here okay have you been"
35:18;35:22;"to China Ezra has a band played there no no I've never been to China I kind of"
35:22;35:29;"remember once once we got an offer for a festival but the timing didn't work out"
35:29;35:34;"but maybe that was our next year yes yeah maybe you all right well not wet"
35:34;35:38;"now that we know each other please send another offer I will send you an offer"
35:38;35:44;"your country feels okay excellent"
35:44;35:50;"now we find ourselves in late December"
35:50;35:57;"I believe that New Year's Eve will be the perfect time for their great"
35:57;36:02;"surrender but they don't remember"
36:02;36:10;"anger once a voice voices one sing singers harmonize did it can't hit"
36:10;36:15;"anything thought that I was free from all that"
36:15;36:23;"questioning but every time a problem is another one begins and the stone walls"
36:23;36:27;"of our own bad witness"
36:27;36:35;"never forgive the side we get snakes inside a place"
36:35;36:41;"I don't wanna live like this but I don't wanna die"
37:00;37:06;"okay so then now we got both of your backstories how do you guys meet and end"
37:06;37:14;"up making a movie together we met through my manager who yeah basically"
37:14;37:20;"said I met a cool financier and you guys should get lunch together it was kind of"
37:20;37:24;"that simple and then we were working on trying to put like some bigger movie"
37:24;37:27;"together that you always need a celebrity for a bigger movie so like"
37:27;37:34;"unlock the cash you know so that people aren't scared and we I still am not"
37:34;37:38;"really good at that like attracting a celebrity and I have like us I think"
37:38;37:43;"part of it is I have a short list of celebrities I like and I find most of"
37:43;37:50;"them like not compelling enough to want to work with or look at so anyway Al was"
37:50;37:55;"like in this we were in this process of waiting for people to read our script"
37:55;38:00;"for this other movie and then Al asked me if I had like a smaller movie that we"
38:00;38:04;"could make in the meantime that we could both act in together because he knew I"
38:04;38:08;"acted and and it was one of those funny things where like the idea of your"
38:08;38:13;"financier like saying they want to be in the movie would usually like to be"
38:13;38:17;"something you don't do but then I just like I mean I'm sure you're already"
38:17;38:21;"sensing the Al has so much charisma so I was like well if I can bottle that"
38:21;38:26;"lightning it'll work you know absolutely as long as he doesn't get scared in"
38:26;38:30;"front of the camera and clam up like if he can just be himself and remain"
38:30;38:35;"confident and and just be let his personality shine then we'll we'll have"
38:35;38:41;"something worth watching so so I was into it and we spent a couple years then"
38:41;38:45;"making the movie it's interesting hearing a little bit about Al's life"
38:45;38:51;"because a lot of that is in his character in the movie his character is"
38:51;38:56;"describing how he grew up in China and that he felt alienated from his friends"
38:56;38:59;"because no one understood the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers and he came"
38:59;39:03;"over to America he started weeping because everyone was just listening to"
39:03;39:09;"EDM is that part of the dialogue? Yeah yeah yeah that's from the heart but it's"
39:09;39:14;"funny Jake you also you have a Grateful Dead cover band right? You're right so"
39:14;39:18;"that really piqued my interest when your character starts talking about the dead"
39:18;39:23;"wait Al are you a deadhead? He's a deadhead he's a deadhead yeah so there"
39:23;39:28;"are very few deadheads in China where you grew up? Actually it is there's so"
39:28;39:33;"many people listen to them but that's the funny thing a lot of Western band"
39:33;39:38;"maybe including you like a Vampire Awakened have so many fans in China but"
39:38;39:42;"maybe you guys don't think about this but actually you guys have very"
39:42;39:47;"good music very good performance your music can spread into other side of the"
39:47;39:52;"world easily so that's why music is so magical you don't need the media you"
39:52;39:57;"don't need a record label your music can naturally connect you to people from"
39:57;40:00;"other side of the world. And that's a really beautiful thing when that happens"
40:00;40:04;"so this part of the movie that Jake's talking about was that your real"
40:04;40:08;"experience that you loved you loved American rock music like the Grateful"
40:08;40:12;"Dead and the Allmans and then when you came to the US everybody was listening"
40:12;40:16;"to EDM and it made you sad is that true or is that kind of like you played it up"
40:16;40:21;"for the movie? Half and half I mean I'm a big rock and roll fan I listen to the"
40:21;40:26;"Canadian progressive band called Rush I mean in China nobody around me listen to"
40:26;40:30;"Rush all this band and I'm young American all my friends in Los Angeles"
40:30;40:36;"nobody listen to Rush nobody listen to Grateful Dead everybody listen to Radiohead"
40:36;40:43;"you know I'm a grr. Listen I like Radiohead but anybody who loves Radiohead but"
40:43;40:48;"doesn't respect Rush is a real ass. They need to open a history book. I've been"
40:48;40:53;"listening to Eddie Money lately you guys listening to Eddie Money at all? A"
40:53;41:00;"classic American rocker. Yeah he's great. Hell yeah. One thing is for sure I don't"
41:00;41:04;"I've never been to China I don't know that much about it but I've always said"
41:04;41:10;"that like the place where rock is really still alive in this world is Mexico and"
41:10;41:15;"other countries in Latin America. In Mexico when you see the some of the size"
41:15;41:20;"venues that some like older rockers come play people are still flying the flag"
41:20;41:25;"for rock and roll music and it's really cool obviously Mexico is a beautiful"
41:25;41:30;"country but yeah America is no longer the rock country that's okay things"
41:30;41:35;"change but that means that the rock nation is international and it's people"
41:35;41:40;"like Jake, Al all over the world who keep the rock flag flying doesn't matter"
41:40;41:45;"where you're from because the world didn't to large extent has turned its"
41:45;41:50;"back on rock music so anybody who's listening to rock music anywhere is part"
41:50;41:53;"of a fraternity."
41:54;42:01;"The world of rock. The world of rock. The rock frat."
42:29;42:33;"Wait so Al I'm just missing one part of the story though when did you become a"
42:33;42:39;"film financier? So when I was booking for music festival in China because Vampire"
42:39;42:54;"Awakens was busy and I was like oh I need to work with somebody else so I brought this American band from Los Angeles called Rooney so I brought Rooney to China so the
frontman of Rooney called Robert Schwartzman"
42:54;43:01;"he's a younger brother of Jason Schwartzman, the cousin of Soviet Coppola and yeah so I"
43:01;43:05;"became a very good friend of Robert Schwartzman so after we become very good"
43:05;43:10;"friends one day Robert is like ""I'm going to direct my first movie you should"
43:10;43:17;"produce with me"" and that's the moment I set up my foot in Hollywood to become"
43:17;43:21;"movie producer with Robert Schwartzman and then I"
43:21;43:26;"produced the two movies for Robert. Wow okay so it was it was music brought you"
43:26;43:31;"to the film world via Robert Schwartzman. Yes. So Al is this the first acting you've"
43:31;43:38;"ever done? Yes I'm really a first-time actor in this movie with the cast so I'm"
43:38;43:43;"very lucky to be in a movie with my very very very good friends so I feel in my"
43:43;43:48;"comfortable zone I feel very relaxed. Dude you're very natural you're very"
43:48;43:53;"good in the movie Al. Thank you because I'm very comfortable with the Carson and"
43:53;43:59;"Olivia. We did the old trick of rehearsing it like endlessly like oh wow"
43:59;44:05;"probably like rehearsed like every scene like 60 times 70 times. Wow. Because we were"
44:05;44:10;"living together so every night we got home we'd rehearse and almost all of it's"
44:10;44:14;"scripted I know it's I hope hopefully it seems like it's not but it is. Yeah it"
44:14;44:20;"doesn't seem scripted. Yeah. In a cool way it feels like you know kind of loose."
44:20;44:25;"Yeah my friend Graham he had this he's like a writer on it was a writer on"
44:25;44:29;"Silicon Valley with me and he had this theory that like if you rehearse"
44:29;44:34;"something zero times it can be good and then if you rehearse it like five times"
44:34;44:39;"it's gonna be bad and then if you rehearse it like 70 times you can make"
44:39;44:45;"it now feel normal you know or natural. So I had that in my head. Horseshoe theory."
44:45;44:50;"Is that the horse I like that yeah it's the shape of it. Or a bell curve. I think that's like a bunch of"
44:50;44:53;"things that like the extremes have something in common. Yeah horseshoe"
44:53;44:57;"theory is that the extremes politically bend towards each other. Yeah that makes sense."
44:57;45:02;"Same as like zero and a hundred times of doing something. Man I can't wait to see"
45:02;45:07;"this movie. I haven't Carson what's the best way for people to watch it? I bought"
45:07;45:13;"it on my Apple TV because I'm a company man. There you go. This is an Apple program"
45:13;45:18;"that we're on. It's right there. So how long were you in the US Al when you guys"
45:18;45:22;"were living together and rehearsing and shooting the movie? It was 10 days. Oh"
45:22;45:28;"well so we yeah cuz sorry just because we shot it in Canada but Al came and"
45:28;45:33;"lived with me for 10 days too where we practiced. And then you rolled up to"
45:33;45:37;"Canada to shoot. Mm-hmm. So it sounds like Al you've been to the US many times and"
45:37;45:42;"so we heard this little that anecdote that's in the movie about being a little"
45:42;45:46;"depressed at the EDMification of the US but generally what have your"
45:46;45:53;"impressions been spending time in the US? It's very great. Also feel you know it's"
45:53;45:59;"not just me also my other friends. Everybody wants. The flight, the plane"
45:59;46:05;"arrive American to Los Angeles. When we walk out you see welcome to Los Angeles."
46:05;46:10;"The mayor of Los Angeles. Welcome to Los Angeles. We always head down. We always"
46:10;46:15;"take our hat. You are welcome. We are happy to be in Los Angeles. It's just"
46:15;46:19;"another once we walk out from the customs gate. You know it's funny people say"
46:19;46:24;"Los Angeles the air is so no good. It's polluted. It's California air. It would be"
46:24;46:28;"great for you living in California in Los Angeles. That's the wonderful. All the"
46:28;46:33;"palm trees, the taco, the people, beautiful people. It's a great freedom."
46:33;46:40;"It's just a catchy vibe. You're making me kind of excited about going back to Los"
46:40;46:44;"Angeles. Have you ever done like a deep American road trip? Have you ever like"
46:44;46:51;"you know been like Texas, Midwest, South? I only did a road trip from Los Angeles to"
46:51;46:56;"San Francisco. It was beautiful. The ocean was really beautiful. So you've"
46:56;47:03;"really seen California? Yeah, Seattle. Okay. Okay, all right. Yeah. So yeah you've seen"
47:03;47:07;"the whole West Coast. All right. Well there's a lot more to love. Next"
47:07;47:10;"time you come to the US you got to give us another report. Yeah. What's the live"
47:10;47:14;"music scene like in China right now or at least where you are? It's the same as"
47:14;47:19;"American and other countries. That's the same because rock and roll, also the pop"
47:19;47:25;"music, pop music, rock and roll, jazz, blues, all from western countries. So from us"
47:25;47:30;"it's all I don't know how to say the proper word. It's like a copycat. It's"
47:30;47:34;"like it's not from this. It's not from our culture. So I think the rock and roll"
47:34;47:39;"here, the blues, jazz, we have to learn from the western countries. So it's of"
47:39;47:44;"course as good as western rock and roll. But at this moment because nobody can do"
47:44;47:50;"international touring. So people for me I have this international ears. I have to"
47:50;47:55;"put up with all the **** band. At this moment my ears have to just listen to"
47:55;48:01;"some not very great musicians play music. I can't wait one day the gate"
48:01;48:06;"open. Everybody can do international travel. I can listen to some very, very"
48:06;48:11;"good musicians do live music again. Are there indoor shows happening? Like"
48:11;48:15;"because in the US it seems like I can't make heads or tails of it. Tours are"
48:15;48:19;"getting pushed or canceled. Then you see pictures of like some packed club. I just"
48:19;48:24;"don't know what's going on. But is it basically like a post-COVID music scene"
48:24;48:29;"now? Yeah but we have to do social distance. Also when we go to a live show"
48:29;48:34;"like club shows, we have to wear a mask. All these things. It's a kind of"
48:34;48:39;"sadness because that's the beauty of to see live music. Everybody laughing."
48:39;48:44;"Everybody have this exciting face. But at this moment everybody wear a mask."
48:44;48:50;"You know it's a happiness but also feel a little bit of sadness because of"
48:50;48:55;"the mask. But it's important to wear a mask. Right. Yeah. Kind of between a rock and a"
48:55;49:00;"hard place on that one. Well it seems like you're a little bit harsh on"
49:00;49:06;"the Chinese rock scene but is there any bright lights that you know that"
49:06;49:11;"you're excited about of Chinese rock bands? Maybe a little bit but that's the"
49:11;49:15;"thing man. This rock and roll culture is not from here. It's really from"
49:15;49:20;"Western countries. So no matter how great we are we still have missing something."
49:20;49:24;"You know it's like we have a Chinese medicine. It's from our country. We have a"
49:24;49:29;"Chinese opera. No matter how hard, how many efforts, Western people try to sing"
49:29;49:33;"very good Chinese opera, doing Chinese medicine, Chinese martial art. But still"
49:33;49:37;"you guys missing something. I think this kind of thing, rock and roll, is really in"
49:37;49:42;"Western cultures a lot. It's tough times for rock and Western culture so I think"
49:42;49:47;"you got to be more optimistic. We need a Chinese rock band to save rock. Okay I"
49:47;49:52;"will quit my movie career. I will go back to play heavy metal. You might have to be"
49:52;49:56;"the one. Well thanks so much guys. I really I can't wait to see the movie."
49:56;50:01;"Yeah there's a lot of heart in the movie. Yeah it's very the character. It was when"
50:01;50:05;"once Al D signed up to play Andy I rewrote the whole script with him in"
50:05;50:11;"mind. Oh wow. I can see that. There was even a guitar part that I cut out. Oh man."
50:11;50:16;"We had a scene like it was sort of a montage of Al D playing guitar and then"
50:16;50:20;"the characters dancing and it was feeling really like an indie movie and"
50:20;50:25;"not in a good way. Right. So I had to cut it out but it was an impressive"
50:25;50:30;"performance. Yeah it's funny I like this movie a lot. It is a small movie but it"
50:30;50:37;"does not have the aspirational charms of many a Sundance film. It's a little blue."
50:37;50:41;"A little yeah it's just you know they're trying to get by. I feel like if these"
50:41;50:46;"characters can survive that that's their success. So yeah it ain't easy for"
50:46;50:51;"everybody you know. Well and I was gonna say also listeners of the show are"
50:51;50:56;"familiar with The Long Dumb Road which you co-wrote and I would say that the"
50:56;51:00;"character that you play Carson is reminiscent of the Manzuka's character"
51:00;51:08;"Richard but with kind of a lot more edge. Yeah I'd say that's a fair assessment of"
51:08;51:12;"it. Yeah Richard never really feels dangerous in The Long Dumb Road whereas"
51:12;51:17;"your character beautiful Bill it has a lot of the same kind of philosophical"
51:17;51:25;"outlooks as Richard but is just unhinged shall we say. Yeah yeah I like movies"
51:25;51:28;"where it feels like people might get hurt in any moment you know what I mean."
51:28;51:32;"Mm-hmm. I think that's what I was trying to where I was trying to get with that"
51:32;51:37;"guy so I'm glad you say that. You got to see some of our Stallions before the"
51:37;51:42;"end of the summer that's Joe Biden mandate. You gotta see some of our"
51:42;51:46;"Stallions. You gotta see some of our Stallions you're not gonna be able to"
51:46;51:49;"get into restaurants if you haven't seen it. Just on the topic of rock and roll"
51:49;51:54;"just because of the week that we're in as we end this anybody want to say"
51:54;51:58;"anything about Charlie Watts legendary drummer of the Rolling Stones who passed"
51:58;52:03;"away at age 80 this week. Long live rock and roll. Yep. There you go. Hell yeah."
52:03;52:10;"Maybe that's the right note to end on. I feel that. Well thanks so much guys yeah"
52:10;52:13;"everybody see the movie and I hope you guys come back soon I hope we all can"
52:13;52:17;"hang out sometime. Yeah thanks for letting us talk about it I'm glad."
52:17;52:22;"Oh absolutely. I never knew all that about Albee's rock and roll career so it's"
52:22;52:27;"good to hear. Fascinating lives. You know Carson and me we only talk about love all the time."
52:27;52:36;"Love talks. Alright guys see you later. Alright thanks so much guys have a good one."
52:36;52:42;"Thank you guys so much. Peace. Bye bye."
52:46;52:50;"tearing our love apart"
52:50;53:00;"Aren't we the same two people who lived through years in the dark?"
53:00;53:03;"Ah, ah, ah"
53:03;53:08;"Every time I try to walk away"
53:08;53:14;"something makes me turn around and stay"
53:14;53:19;"And I can't tell you why"
53:19;53:27;"So just real quick before we move on to our next guest out of the long-stretch Rolodex hot off the presses"
53:27;53:34;"Yeah, just now the press releases come out saying that Mountain Dew has partnered with"
53:34;53:39;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos to make a Flamin' Hot Mountain Dew"
53:39;53:46;"Sounds real nasty just like all the other"
53:47;53:49;"Flamin' Hot combos they all they all sound disgusting"
53:49;53:54;"This is what the press release says. I just this is a great use of language"
53:54;53:57;"This is one of our most provocative beverages yet"
53:57;54:03;"And we're excited for Doonation and for Doonation to taste the unique blend of spicy and classy"
54:03;54:05;"Doonation"
54:05;54:12;"Flavor of Mountain Dew. I just provocative and Doonation. Sorry guys, but nothing's shocking at this point, right?"
54:12;54:16;"I mean, this is one of those things where it's just like if you told me they already did it"
54:16;54:22;"I'd be like, oh, I guess we missed that one. Yeah, it's just like we just kind of live in a world where"
54:22;54:29;"Nothing special. So it's you know, somebody anything you could think of if somebody are there Flamin' Hot Twinkies"
54:29;54:32;"Is there Mountain Dew flavored?"
54:32;54:34;"shredded wheat"
54:34;54:40;"Probably also it's a soda looking glass. I don't want provocative. I'm just trying to crack a can of soda"
54:40;54:46;"This isn't like a Lars van Trier movie. I don't and we I don't need provocative"
54:46;54:50;"Doesn't it feel like we're like two years from do you remember Nathan Fielder's?"
54:50;54:53;"excrement flavored frozen yogurt"
54:53;54:58;"Oh, yeah, the poo flavored fro-yo. I feel like that's like on a horizon like that"
54:58;55:04;"That's that's like gonna be prophetic at this bit. Oh, this also linked we talked about the Mountain Dew"
55:04;55:11;"Alcoholic beverage. Is it called Mountain Brew? No, but the title of the lawsuit Brew the Dew is"
55:12;55:16;"The sort of Mountain Dew beer. Yeah, it's Mountain Dew a hard"
55:16;55:23;"Said a hard seltzer alcohol. I mean, I just assume they infused alcohol into the gross"
55:23;55:25;"Yeah"
55:25;55:31;"Drink, it's hard Mountain Dew Mountain spelled MTN. No caffeine 5% alcohol"
55:31;55:34;"I also say like for that for this one"
55:34;55:37;"I mean mark it not that I'm into design of it"
55:37;55:40;"But you know since we talked about the sort of beverage bottle design"
55:40;55:42;"I guess I'd have to send it to you"
55:42;55:49;"I'm sort of into it in that it feels like really dark like it feels like not like abject"
55:49;55:51;"But like it is sort of like I think I brought up on the show"
55:51;55:58;"Remember Harley Davidson cigarettes when I was growing up. That was like they were if they were Davidson cigarettes. I don't remember those"
55:58;56:01;"There was a kid has never come up on the show before"
56:01;56:06;"I thought I had so when I when I was in high school Harley Davidson released cigarettes"
56:06;56:12;"this is gonna be sort of mid 90s, and I remember there was this one kid a non sing and"
56:12;56:18;"He smoked Harley Davidson was on the debate team and he smoked Harley Davidson cigarettes"
56:18;56:22;"It was a very small guy, but I just remember he'd pull out like it was already sort of like"
56:22;56:26;"Badass enough that he smoked and sort of out of character enough"
56:26;56:33;"They smoked but that he'd pull out the Harley Davidson cigarettes was amazing and the packaging was that it was black"
56:33;56:38;"It was a black box. That's hard with the like the eagle on it"
56:38;56:42;"I believe or the Harley Davidson logo and so yeah, but it was like very scary"
56:42;56:49;"I mean it was a you know cigarettes that just come in a black box. It's funny that there was Harley Davidson"
56:49;56:53;"Cigarettes because I'm sure I've referenced this on the show at some point in the last"
56:53;56:59;"500 episodes, but there's a movie that I've never actually seen but I know is there's an infamous movie"
56:59;57:04;"I think it's from the 80s that was called Harley Davidson meets the Marlboro man"
57:04;57:11;"And it was like an early branded film for two different brands where there's a guy who became the personification of Harley Davidson"
57:11;57:17;"There's a character named Harley Davidson, and he somehow met the Marlboro man"
57:17;57:23;"And they go on an adventure some shit actually Seinfeld pull that up cuz is it like a film like some sort of like Richard"
57:23;57:26;"Prince kind of like I don't know no this is like trash"
57:26;57:32;"This is a trash film Wow you never heard of Harley Davidson meets the Marlboro man. I've heard of it, but I"
57:32;57:41;"It's very dim. Yeah, Don Johnson Mickey Rourke race onto the screen is to modern-day Robin Hood. Oh, it's big. Whoa actors"
57:41;57:44;"Mickey Rourke and is that"
57:44;57:51;"Right it's called Harley Davidson and the Marlboro man also starring Giancarlo Esposito Gus spring. Oh breaking bad"
57:51;57:56;"What year did this movie come out"
57:56;58:00;"1991 okay, so this might be somebody's soul movie"
58:00;58:04;"I don't know if it was number one at the box office, but anybody who's born in 1981"
58:04;58:06;"I want you to double-check that Harley Davidson the Marlboro man is"
58:06;58:09;"your soul movie the film"
58:09;58:15;"Cost 23 million dollars to make and grossed seven million dollars at the domestic box office"
58:15;58:22;"Flop size more also in the film who great character act wait, so this is this is a big budget big name movie"
58:24;58:29;"Evidently. Whoa. Yeah, I mean these are two huge brands"
58:29;58:35;"I think they're definitely not going for an arthouse movie. I mean, it's no but"
58:35;58:39;"Fields character so"
58:39;58:43;"Fields character is named after the cigarette brand of Virginia Slims"
58:43;58:47;"Big John Studd's character is named after the whiskey brand Jack Daniels and"
58:47;58:51;"Eloy Casado's characters named after the tequila brand Jose Cuervo"
58:51;58:55;"So it's kind of like a Avengers an Avengers of"
58:55;59:00;"Ventures of"
59:00;59:05;"MCU this is yeah this universe"
59:05;59:11;"This is actually the time crisis soul movie, yeah, this is"
59:11;59:14;"TC movie club everyone"
59:14;59:17;"If time crisis was a person"
59:17;59:22;"They probably would have been born in 1981 right in between me and Jake and this would be their soul movie"
59:22;59:27;"Hell, yeah, the TC man was born in 81 and this is a soul movie Wow"
59:27;59:28;"Yeah"
59:28;59:30;"I'm so curious what the tone is if it's just like"
59:30;59:36;"It sounds like they just probably made a movie about a bunch of tough people and they just use the names or I wonder if"
59:36;59:41;"There's like a lot of reference to like the actual products. Yeah, like I wonder what era is"
59:41;59:48;"It said is like a Western is it like a motorcycle gang and like kind of proto sons of anarchy kind of situation"
59:48;59:54;"I mean, I'm just now I'm intrigued Kevin Thomas of the LA Times called it a mindless cobbling from countless buddy movies"
59:54;01:00:00;"Whereas Owen Gleiberman Entertainment Weekly called it a kinetic formula shoot-em-up nice"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"It sounds like it was set present-day"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"like"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"1991 I don't think it was a period"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"Whatever it is. We should just"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"take the plot and"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"Just make it about like all our favorite brands"
01:00:15;01:00:21;"Mountain Dew and Flamin Hot Cheetos and just like Ansel Elgort as Mountain Dew"
01:00:21;01:00:25;"Timothy Chalamet as Flamin Hot Cheetos"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"Sidney Sweeney is Wendy"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Colin Farrell as the Burger King"
01:00:34;01:00:39;"Wait, so it's like about the brands and it's like shut up and see the movie"
01:00:39;01:00:44;"It's a kinetic fast-paced shoot-em-up. They climb Mountain Dew. Yeah"
01:00:44;01:00:51;"Sort of like a holy mountain. Yeah, they go to mountain. Oh, it's like so this is actually the hero film Al Pacino is"
01:00:51;01:00:57;"McDonald. Oh, wait a second. Okay, so Matt sent over the synopsis"
01:00:57;01:01:02;"It's a daring heist to save their favorite saloon set in the near future"
01:01:02;01:01:09;"The biker and his cowboy pal knock over an armored car only to discover its payload is a new synthetic drug"
01:01:09;01:01:14;"That the bad guys will stop at nothing to get back. It's on HBO max. Oh"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Wait, what the so wait, so"
01:01:17;01:01:24;"So Harley Davidson and Marlboro man are just two guys just two kind of like bar flies at a local saloon"
01:01:24;01:01:30;"I wonder if it opens is like the bartender comes like bad news guys. We got it closed and Harley Davidson's like no way"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"This is my favorite bar and he's like my good friend Marlboro man"
01:01:34;01:01:38;"Are we gonna stand for this and he's just like absolutely not"
01:01:38;01:01:45;"Let's figure something out. Is this guy's name Marlboro man? I'm just I bought the Harley Davidson could be a person's name"
01:01:45;01:01:53;"Yeah, I think what's happening is that they are these people have been named after the thing that they're associated with maybe so like Mickey"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"Mickey's character drives a Harley"
01:01:56;01:01:59;"Don Johnson's character smokes and then so they call them"
01:01:59;01:02:04;"They just leave those are their nicknames. It has a Dick Tracy vibe"
01:02:04;01:02:12;"Okay. Oh Tia Carreras in this Oh tight all-star. They should have had a the camel from camel cigarettes"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"bad guy"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"Joe camel just like this disgusting"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"weird"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Camelman, that would be like Dick Tracy"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"It's just like this weird-ass camel man rolls into town and he's selling a synthetic"
01:02:26;01:02:32;"Drug to all the kids in the city and the Marlboro man Harley Davidson need to stop him"
01:02:32;01:02:37;"Are you picturing like practical latex effects or like CG like early proto CG?"
01:02:37;01:02:42;"It's gonna look like kangaroo jack"
01:02:42;01:02:46;"Yeah, actually, you know what fine you guys up you didn't put Joe Camel in Joe"
01:02:46;01:02:51;"Camel is gonna be in Mountain Dew and the Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Timothy Chalamet is Flamin' Hot Cheeto"
01:02:51;01:02:56;"Timothy Chalamet is Cheeto and he just wears sort of like that"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"Kanye just like a red"
01:02:59;01:03:03;"It's like a big red hoodie. Yeah, like a red leather"
01:03:03;01:03:09;"Suit, wait, is it a guy whose name is Cheeto or is he literally playing like a large?"
01:03:15;01:03:19;"No, we're gonna be like we're gonna go meet with the studio executives"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"We're gonna ask exactly that question Jake and we're just gonna say can you just shut the fuck up?"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"It's a kinetic shoot-'em-up. Yeah, it's a kinetic shooter. No. No, can I just stop you right there?"
01:03:27;01:03:33;"It really pisses me off when people ask these kind of questions. It's a kinetic shoot-'em-up"
01:03:33;01:03:38;"The guy's name is Cheeto. You don't have to explain this to people people are smarter than you give them credit for"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"Well, I'm funding the movie. I want to know if he's playing a human or not"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"He's gonna wear a red Yeezy sweatshirt and his name is Flamin' Hot Cheeto"
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Actually now I'm thinking of a totally different movie. That's just"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"Chester Cheeto versus Joe Camel"
01:03:52;01:03:58;"This is actually a CG. Yeah a children's animated film. Late period Tim Burton"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"Yeah"
01:04:01;01:04:07;"Johnny Depp is Johnny. Oh Johnny Depp is Chester Cheeto. That sounds like it actually happened. That definitely happened"
01:04:07;01:04:12;"Oh, yeah, like it's just called Chester. That's a good Mandela effect one"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"Just start saying the next time anybody ever brings up the Mandela effect to you"
01:04:15;01:04:19;"Like yeah when I always thought that it was Berenstain Bears"
01:04:19;01:04:23;"But it's Berenstain Bears and a lot of people remember it that way be like, yo, I'm with you"
01:04:23;01:04:29;"Like for instance, I thought that Johnny Depp as Chester Cheeto never happened, but actually that's a real film"
01:04:29;01:04:35;"No, no, no, I don't think that ever happened. No, it did. No, no millions of people remember seeing"
01:04:35;01:04:40;"Johnny Depp in the Chester Cheeto movie Tim Burton directed it it came out in"
01:04:40;01:04:46;"2017 it's kind of underwhelming at the box office, but they made up for it with merch"
01:04:46;01:04:53;"No, no millions of people remember seeing this movie. It was so huge in China. There's nothing on IMDB"
01:04:53;01:04:57;"I've talked with thousands of people we get together at conferences and we all remember"
01:04:57;01:05:03;"It was the fourth most successful movie in the Chinese box office of all time. Yeah. Yeah, Johnny Depp as Chester Cheeto"
01:05:03;01:05:09;"Uh-huh. No, no, trust me. They memory hold it. They don't want people to know about it, but millions of us saw it"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"Did we lose those guys?"
01:05:10;01:05:15;"He lost the guys everyone cut out for a second on me. I got Matt and Ezra"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"Yep, me too"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"Those guys got trapped in the matrix. They went into the universe"
01:05:20;01:05:25;"Where the Chester Cheeto Johnny Depp film was actually made"
01:05:25;01:05:54;"*music*"
01:05:54;01:06:01;"All right, so now we've got Mountain Brews and Richard Pictures and LA Takedown"
01:06:01;01:06:06;"Collaborator Aaron Olsen back on the program. Let's get him on the horn"
01:06:06;01:06:10;"Now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
01:06:10;01:06:18;"Hey Aaron, welcome back to time crisis. Hi. Thanks first question for you"
01:06:18;01:06:24;"Do you remember did you ever see that that late Tim Burton Johnny Depp Chester Cheeto movie?"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Where Johnny Depp played Chester Cheeto?"
01:06:26;01:06:33;"It was after Alice in Wonderland and after Big Eyes. It was in that same run where they did Big Eyes"
01:06:33;01:06:38;"Yeah, after Big Eyes Alice in Wonderland, they did the will the new Willy Wonka. They did a Chester Cheeto movie"
01:06:38;01:06:42;"No, is this real? What's happened? Do you tell me? It's like a"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"2017 Tim Burton film"
01:06:45;01:06:49;"It's actually one of the better of that kind of late period Tim Burton CG movies"
01:06:49;01:06:53;"Have you ever seen a Harley Davidson in the Marlboro Man movie?"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"No, but I'm familiar with it that has the Dice Man in it, right?"
01:06:56;01:07:03;"Well, that's Andrew Dice Clay's in that too. I knew Aaron would be familiar with this movie. I think he plays a bouncer in it"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"I don't know. I mean"
01:07:05;01:07:08;"Is this correct? I don't know. I don't see Andrew Dice Clay"
01:07:08;01:07:12;"It seems like something you did"
01:07:12;01:07:18;"No, that'd be perfect. Maybe it's an uncredited cameo. I've heard of the film, but I can't say I've heard of this Chester Cheeto"
01:07:18;01:07:21;"Film, but I wouldn't be surprised"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"if they donned"
01:07:23;01:07:28;"Johnny Depp in some like orange cake dust and yeah, I don't do that"
01:07:28;01:07:35;"What won't he do? It's actually a really cool movie and Johnny had a lot of fun with it. He based a lot of his"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"character on kind of like early Ozzy Osbourne"
01:07:39;01:07:43;"because he just gets like real kind of like wild and crazy and he kind of felt like"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"Ozzy was like a cool person to pull from and"
01:07:46;01:07:52;"Anyway, welcome back to the show. How's it going? Thanks. It's good. Things are fine"
01:07:52;01:07:57;"How you guys doing doing great over here? Not bad Aaron your band le takedown"
01:07:57;01:08:03;"released an album called our feeling of natural high in March of"
01:08:03;01:08:07;"2020 yes, you were slated to play a"
01:08:08;01:08:12;"record release show doing exclusively doors covers on"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"like"
01:08:14;01:08:18;"Friday March 13th or something. Is that right? That's all correct"
01:08:18;01:08:25;"And yeah, if we're lucky it'll get canceled again, and then I'll get back on time crisis again after that to talk about it"
01:08:25;01:08:30;"That's what I was gonna say because you have a you've rescheduled the gig for a year and a half later"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"It's scheduled for what day September something September 10th"
01:08:34;01:08:38;"But you know it does it I was wondering about this as I you know"
01:08:38;01:08:46;"The Delta very and all this kind of stuff. I feel like there's I don't know what 50% chance this gets canceled again"
01:08:46;01:08:53;"There's a chance, you know, I'm in general, you know, I'm I have a lot of things coming up like live various"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"performances and I'm just taking the attitude of"
01:08:56;01:09:01;"saying yes, and then not trying to not be disappointed when they get canceled, but"
01:09:02;01:09:07;"Yeah, there's a chance and then there's a chance. I'll come back on time crisis and talk about how it got canceled again"
01:09:07;01:09:11;"And then we can just keep doing this for years to come I think"
01:09:11;01:09:15;"The doors show that never happened if this one gets canceled"
01:09:15;01:09:21;"I mean we've talked at length on time crisis about how the people kind of turned their back on the doors in"
01:09:21;01:09:27;"The 90s the doors were considered one of the major classic rock bands people like Jim Morrison"
01:09:27;01:09:32;"They had posters of him and then people really turned their back on the doors if this show gets canceled"
01:09:32;01:09:38;"I think that's definitive proof that not only have rock fans turn their backs on the doors the universe has"
01:09:38;01:09:42;"Hmm on the quantum level if this one gets canceled again"
01:09:42;01:09:46;"I'm sorry doors fans like that's that the Lord on the towel"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"Crosby wins"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"They don't swing man, they do not swing"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"I'm just picturing like"
01:09:58;01:10:06;"Crosby like overlaid with the like the clouds in the sky and he's just like laughing his ass off laughs like evil Crosby laugh"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"He's dead"
01:10:08;01:10:13;"No, he's just he's not dead he's just he just represents like"
01:10:13;01:10:19;"The Godhead I'm picturing a situation like someone tweets at him like doors cover band show canceled"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"And then he's kind of by himself in his house nodding"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"smiling and doing a"
01:10:25;01:10:30;"Good man, just clapping by himself. Yeah, you know, that would be a classic Crosby treat"
01:10:30;01:10:34;"Yeah, just he quote tweets it just like some rando just treats it him. Hey cross"
01:10:34;01:10:40;"There's been a doors cover band in LA that just had their second show in a row get canceled and cross"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"You just quote read that above it, right good"
01:10:43;01:10:47;"Good period"
01:10:47;01:10:54;"Serves them right. What's the name of the doors cover band again writers on the doors a the doors"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"experience"
01:10:56;01:11:07;"I think we have John Nixon Richard pictures and Mountain Bruce to thank for that one writers on the doors"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"Colors experience. Yes"
01:11:10;01:11:14;"Experience a the doors"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"I"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"Like the wordy names. It kind of reminds me a little bit of our"
01:11:20;01:11:25;"Eagles band that never played a gig where it was dick pics presents. No wait, what was it?"
01:11:25;01:11:29;"barely Eagles, right, right I"
01:11:29;01:11:39;"Don't want to get too contentious here, but I just got asked I'm hearing that John from Richard pictures is involved in this was"
01:11:39;01:11:44;"The offer ever extended to Jake was there a lack of interest?"
01:11:44;01:11:48;"I'm not trying to stir shit up in the organization, but is it possible?"
01:11:48;01:11:52;"Did you feel like you know what Jake maybe Jake swings too hard?"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"- that's not a nice cover band. I"
01:11:55;01:12:03;"Definitely have the least amount of swing of any of the people that we play music with I can I can vouch for that"
01:12:03;01:12:08;"Not my foot but I"
01:12:08;01:12:16;"Don't know. I mean Jake was there when the initial when the genesis of this happened. Yeah, I don't know what I would do"
01:12:16;01:12:22;"That's more the thing, you know, there's no I mean the doors was a pretty minimalist outfit"
01:12:22;01:12:26;"So I there's just not a lot for me to do with the doors cover band"
01:12:26;01:12:30;"Like it's Richard pictures and Mountain Brews. My plate is full"
01:12:30;01:12:35;"I think that might have been the thing too is like you were just I can imagine the situation having gone"
01:12:35;01:12:41;"Like oh, that's cool guys. Like miss it this out or like I'm just out. I mean to be honest"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"I never received an offer. Okay?"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"But that's okay"
01:12:46;01:12:50;"No offense taken. I don't think there'd be much for me to do. Yeah, one question"
01:12:50;01:12:57;"I have is when you do touch me how big is the horn section and string section that you're bringing with you huge"
01:12:57;01:13:03;"We got the the Phil harmonic. So for touch me you're gonna have about 40 people on stage"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Yeah at the permanent records Road"
01:13:05;01:13:10;"No, yeah, we're just doing it it's gonna be"
01:13:10;01:13:15;"Keys Ryan's gonna be playing keys. There's we're not gonna have any horns or anything"
01:13:15;01:13:19;"And then I think John even learned the sax solo on the guitar"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Of course he did. Yeah"
01:13:21;01:13:28;"So yeah, it's we're not having any horns. We're keeping it, you know Roadhouse II and this shows on September 10th"
01:13:28;01:13:31;"Do you think you're gonna make it to midnight? And if so"
01:13:31;01:13:35;"Are you gonna say anything about the 20th anniversary of 9/11?"
01:13:35;01:13:40;"You know, you've given me an idea, but I don't know what I could possibly say or what you know"
01:13:40;01:13:45;"Our Jim could you know, maybe he could recite a poem like an American prayer"
01:13:45;01:13:50;"Excerpts at the stroke of midnight. Isn't there a Dora song called the end?"
01:13:50;01:13:57;"Yes. Oh, yeah, you could go into the end and when you do the kind of spoken word you can say something about"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"9/11 or something kind of serious"
01:14:00;01:14:07;"We can go into the inside job angle and like, you know, just this will be the perfect. Oh, yeah a tower 7 monologue"
01:14:07;01:14:14;"Yeah, exactly. Yeah, Jessica who's our Jim can just totally go off on a do her Crosby actually Crosby at Monterey"
01:14:14;01:14:19;"And do the whole conspiracy rant and it'll be great. All right. Well, that's something to look forward to"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"So yeah, just at least say hey guys"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"I know some of you in the crowd are probably expecting we're gonna do a whole"
01:14:25;01:14:33;"9/11 20th anniversary rap tonight because it's the night before we just wanted to say we don't think that's appropriate"
01:14:34;01:14:38;"If anybody wants to come rap with us after the show, we'll be at the merch table"
01:14:38;01:14:47;"Yeah, what as you're saying it might be weirder if you don't do it right I just gotta say that sucks"
01:14:47;01:14:53;"The last the last thing I want is people to come up to me at a merch table"
01:14:53;01:15:01;"Ready to talk about 9/11 like one in the morning. Yeah, I will say I do you gotta say something"
01:15:01;01:15:06;"Yeah, okay. I get that. Yeah, you know, it'll be the elephant in the room if we don't address it"
01:15:06;01:15:14;"Everyone's gonna be just because it's the 20th anniversary. Is that why yes, I do think that somewhere out there"
01:15:14;01:15:21;"there is someone who a thinks the doors are the quintessential American band and"
01:15:21;01:15:26;"Then thus is gonna be like listening to the doors"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"commemorating the 20th"
01:15:28;01:15:34;"Year anniversary of 9/11. I feel like in someone's head out there that makes sense. Yes"
01:15:34;01:15:40;"They're definitely over the age of 50. I think the doors might be the quintessential American band"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"But something you know, what's weird about it?"
01:15:42;01:15:47;"I got to think more about this, but I remember the doors being very big in the 90s"
01:15:47;01:15:52;"They were considered one of the most important American classic rock bands and then in the following decades that changed"
01:15:52;01:15:56;"Did 9/11 have something to do with it in some weird way?"
01:15:57;01:16:03;"I'm being serious like they're really I mean anybody who was actually alive during 9/11 and certainly in the years that followed"
01:16:03;01:16:06;"remember there was so much talk about"
01:16:06;01:16:11;"Irony is dead and this changes everything and this is like a watershed moment for culture"
01:16:11;01:16:16;"People said a lot of stuff like that. Was there something about the post 9/11 era?"
01:16:16;01:16:22;"That was unfavorable to the doors in their legacy. I feel like they would have thrived like they represent a"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"bold"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"American bravado in a way that"
01:16:27;01:16:34;"Probably would have resonated with people at the time who are getting amped up about America or are they too far out?"
01:16:34;01:16:38;"Are they like, you know, they had a song called 20th Century Fox"
01:16:38;01:16:42;"Well, they were 20th century band man, because they got left in the 20th century"
01:16:42;01:16:47;"We're trying to change all that here at the Roadhouse by playing to 50 people"
01:16:47;01:16:54;"I'm very curious to see a if this show happens and be how that affects the trajectory of the doors because the last 20 years"
01:16:54;01:17:01;"Have been very anti doors. Are you gonna play any LA takedown material or is it only doors? It's only doors"
01:17:01;01:17:05;"I respect the conceptual tightness of that Ryan Weinstein"
01:17:05;01:17:11;"Who will be DJing the show will be playing songs from our album throughout the night"
01:17:11;01:17:17;"He also hopefully will play I made a years ago a light my fire"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"house"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"mix"
01:17:19;01:17:25;"Based off of a note. I left myself that just said light my fire house mix, but it's just a house"
01:17:25;01:17:31;"Version of light my fire and I had it cut for him a long time ago on a record"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"And so hopefully he'll be playing that but it's just the opening riff"
01:17:34;01:17:41;"Okay, so even there's something for dance music fans"
01:17:41;01:17:48;"Oh, yeah, anybody who lives within 500 miles of Los Angeles get your ass to the permanent records Roadhouse"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"on September 10th to see"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"riders on the doors a the doors"
01:17:54;01:17:57;"Experience did I get it right? You got it, right?"
01:17:57;01:18:01;"Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna add to that. Please get vaccinated"
01:18:01;01:18:06;"Before you come to our show. Oh, yeah that too. We just throw that in there and"
01:18:06;01:18:13;"Make sure you've seen your soul movie. You can't get into the show or any gathering until you've seen your soul movie"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"Also true. I think I listened to the episode where you talked about soul movies"
01:18:17;01:18:20;"We did one episode of a of time crisis"
01:18:20;01:18:27;"but you also might have heard about it on the daily or pod save America because Joe wrote or Joe Rogan because"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"Joe Biden was doing kind of a press tour to talk about soul movies"
01:18:31;01:18:38;"Because he's serious about it. Yeah, that was a great episode of the Joe Rogan experience when President Biden went on and talked about soul movies"
01:18:38;01:18:42;"Racked up like 10 million views in the first week"
01:18:42;01:18:48;"Jeez, okay, you guys clearly know what I'm what I'm listening to in my spare time"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"I"
01:18:58;01:19:24;"You know Aaron"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"I was thinking about you the other day because I came across this"
01:19:27;01:19:35;"This gentle giant album cover, you know gentle giant I do they have one of the great mascots of rock"
01:19:35;01:19:39;"Do you know this it's called acquiring the taste. Can you see it at all?"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"It's so similar to your dad's airbrushed painting that you used"
01:19:42;01:19:46;"It's like I don't know if you could really see the texture like yeah"
01:19:46;01:19:53;"Yeah cover and then it's it has that same look of like kind of 70s air and it's just such a crazy cover to acquiring"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"The taste yes, and is that a it's a tongue-licking a peach"
01:19:57;01:20:03;"Yeah, it's so graphic. That is a great album title to acquiring the taste"
01:20:03;01:20:08;"Acquiring the taste and honestly, I'm not a big gentle giant head or anything"
01:20:08;01:20:13;"But that is the that is a good entry point for the band. So it is aptly that album in particular"
01:20:13;01:20:21;"Yeah, also I should point out gentle Giants mascot is like a bald guy with the beard. I don't know if you've ever seen that"
01:20:22;01:20:29;"No, he's the gentle giant. I guess he's just a human as far as I can tell this cover is psycho"
01:20:29;01:20:36;"It's amazing. I'm honored that that gross man looking at peaches cracked made you think of me"
01:20:36;01:20:41;"We got to start a gentle giant cover band"
01:20:41;01:20:48;"It's the band is called acquiring the taste a gentle giant tribute that probably exists"
01:20:48;01:20:51;"probably doesn't"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"Okay, let's get into the top five"
01:20:54;01:21:06;"Okay, so this week for the top five we're comparing the top five hits of two different years"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"1965 and"
01:21:09;01:21:15;"1995 30 years apart but a lot changed in those 30 years. So Aaron you pick these years, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"Yeah, how'd you come up with 65 and 95?"
01:21:21;01:21:27;"I couldn't decide between 65 or 95 just because I thought you know, those are okay"
01:21:27;01:21:34;"95 is probably my peak of paying attention to current music. Hmm. How old I was 10"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"I still have a VHS tape"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"That's your peak Wow. I think so"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"I kept it"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"you know VHS tape in the VCR and I"
01:21:42;01:21:49;"Record every time a music video came on that I liked and I still have the tape and it's like pretty sure that's from 95"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"95 is also the year your soul movie came out. What kind of"
01:21:52;01:21:58;"Videos, would you have been recording in 95? What would come on like TV that you'd be like, oh, yeah"
01:21:58;01:22:04;"There were like some kind of grail videos that I was like waiting for and that I never got I remember really wanting to catch"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"So what you want? Oh"
01:22:06;01:22:14;"It was all like they're in a forest and it's all fish. I yeah. Yeah, there's like back loser is on there twice for some reason"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"Mother"
01:22:17;01:22:22;"I think it's called mother 95. It's the day Rollins band the"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"Right, but it's like a different version of mother"
01:22:26;01:22:33;"But it has a lot of concert footage and I always thought it was really hilarious like how well shampooed his hair was"
01:22:33;01:22:39;"You thought this was funny when you were 10. Yeah, I thought Danzig was pretty funny when I was 10"
01:22:39;01:22:44;"He's also wearing a mesh tank top. I thought all these things were I remember that video?"
01:22:44;01:22:47;"Yeah, and it like has all these cuts it like cuts to him. He's shaking his head really"
01:22:47;01:22:51;"I don't know worth watching that video. Yeah, that stuff's on there. There's"
01:22:51;01:22:58;"This letter song. I know that's actually not on there some Nirvana. There's like the interstitials"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"That they had like it was like a guy"
01:23:01;01:23:04;"Spinning a globe picking a place to move to I don't know"
01:23:04;01:23:10;"It was just the weird but 95 was my peak of being interested in MTV at least and then 65"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"I love the music of the 60s. So I thought"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"No, let's try that"
01:23:16;01:23:21;"Roughly, we're 30 years apart. We're in yeah, roughly. We're 30 years from 95"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"We're getting there"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"pretty close"
01:23:24;01:23:30;"All right. Well the number five song this week in 1965 was the four tops with it's the same old song a"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"classic"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Holland dozer Holland song"

01:24:08;01:24:11;"The drums are really hypnotic on this song."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I remember having a Casio keyboard"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"and that was the Motown beat."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Oh, really?"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Oh, was this?"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"Yeah, preset beats."
01:24:17;01:24:20;"It's just snare on every beat."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"And then the kick comes in"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"between the last two snares, usually."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"It's worth noting that this is 32 years later"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"after this song came out,"
01:24:28;01:24:31;"the Four Tops starred in a commercial for Velveeta"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"where they reworked this song"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"as not the same old side."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"Sample lyric, ""For a side dish made to please,"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"you only want Velveeta shells and cheese."""
01:24:41;01:24:44;"It's not the same old side."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Okay."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"That doesn't feel like clear,"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"like that needs explanation."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Like would you, a side?"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"Yeah, it's a little side dish, but yeah."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"I know, I understand."
01:24:57;01:25:00;"No, no, it's like a mixed metaphor."
01:25:00;01:25:05;"Like usually I think with like fun marketing,"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"you'd want to take something familiar"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"and change one thing about it."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Like if you were,"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"I don't know why you'd be selling a song,"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"but you might say, ""It's not the same old song."""
01:25:15;01:25:17;"That sounds like some morning radio thing"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"where they're like, ""Andy and Debra,"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"it's not the same old song."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"We're playing all the new music."""
01:25:22;01:25:24;"That would make sense, straightforward."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"They do a twist."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"It's not the same old song."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"Or you could do, ""It's the same old side."""
01:25:30;01:25:31;"You know, you just change one thing."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"They've done too much to it."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"They might as well have changed every word in that."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Yeah, right."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Very forced."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"But I like to think in '97,"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"the four tops still had like cultural cache to be like,"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"""Let's get the four tops."""
01:25:45;01:25:48;"There's a lot of boomers who are now in their fifties"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"who are buying mac and cheese for their kids."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"Yep."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Divorced dads."
01:25:52;01:25:56;"A lot of divorced dads listening to oldies radio."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Or popping by the Vons on their way home from work,"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"picking up a boxed mac."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"You wanna know something?"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"I think it might've been, yeah."
01:26:03;01:26:07;"Well, I'm also thinking mac and cheese is an aside."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"I mean, I know it's a side."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"I know you can get it if you get like a meat and three,"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"but especially for kids, it's the meal."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"That is the main."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"But also--"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"I'm just like, none of this is,"
01:26:16;01:26:17;"none of this works. Yeah, you know what?"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"This is funny."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"This is like bringing back memories"
01:26:19;01:26:24;"'cause I very rarely had Velveeta shells and cheese."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Yeah, Kraft."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Yeah, you'd have Kraft mac and cheese is the classic."
01:26:27;01:26:30;"So my question is, I mean,"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"I don't wanna derail the whole show,"
01:26:31;01:26:34;"but like is Velveeta some like,"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"even that name, when you actually look at it,"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"what the (beep) is that Velveeta?"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"I mean, I'm guessing, I'm going out on,"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Seinfeld, can you start looking it up?"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"'Cause I'm gonna go out on a limb here"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"and guess that some execs somewhere"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"probably were like mac and cheese is seen"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"as like kinda like a (beep) kid food,"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"but it tastes really good and people love it."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"Let's make a version that sounds kinda classy"
01:26:56;01:26:59;"for divorced dads, older people,"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"and let's change something about it."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Going back to the rule about you change one thing."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Let's change one thing about mac and cheese"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"to make it feel more grown up."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"Let's change the pasta."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"What else could it be?"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"What's something that sounds classy?"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"How about shells and cheese?"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"Shells makes you think about a beach vacation."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Something like, okay, I like that."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"So what are we gonna call the shells and cheese?"
01:27:20;01:27:23;"Now that's something a 50 year old divorced dad can have."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"That's a dignified meal for that guy."
01:27:25;01:27:29;"Kraft mac and cheese at the condo does not feel good."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"Now shells and cheese, it's simple, but it's dignified."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"All right, so what do we call this?"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Let's come up with a word that almost sounds like"
01:27:36;01:27:40;"it could be like a European perfume."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Let's do like a fake word."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Okay, but let's base it off something classy."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"How about velvet?"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"Classy, all right."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Velveeta."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"That's how I think this came about."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Seinfeld, any truth to that?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"None."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"- No, yeah."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"- None."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"- Velveeta, so shells and cheese."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"- Great theory though."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"- It's a great theory, it's a great story."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"The Velveeta shells and cheese came out in '84,"
01:28:03;01:28:07;"decades after Velveeta was founded in 1918"
01:28:07;01:28:11;"by Emil Frey of the Monroe Cheese Company."
01:28:11;01:28:14;"- Emil Velveeta, an immigrant from Italy."
01:28:14;01:28:17;"- It's Vemley."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Velveeta is owned by Kraft."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"So it's Kraft Velveeta shells and cheese."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- Okay, so if it's owned by the same company,"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"there's definitely been a conversation somewhere"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"where somebody was like, all right,"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"so we're talking about the guy who's ready to move up"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"to Velveeta shells and cheese from Kraft Mac and Cheese."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"What's going on with that guy in his life?"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"You know, who is he or she?"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"What are they doing?"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"- Little older."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"- Like graduating to this involves getting divorced."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"- Yeah."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"- Well, yeah, I mean, I think who's the guy--"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"- You win some, you lose some."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"- That ate it growing up"
01:28:50;01:28:54;"and now it would feel too regressive to continue to eat it."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"- 100%."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"- So we just need to spin it, but it's got, you know,"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"we got to spin it, but we don't want to lose,"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"we don't want to lose that buyer."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"- It's not the same old sad."
01:29:05;01:29:09;"- Sound like you said sad."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"It's a new kind of sad."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- Yeah."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"Are you over the age of 30 and find it depressing"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"when you cook up some Mac and Cheese for your dinner?"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Well, guess what?"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"You're in luck."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"- It's not the same."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"(Jared humming)"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"Even if I'm wrong about the Velveeta origin story,"
01:29:26;01:29:30;"100%, at least once Kraft acquired it,"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"it became part of like the life cycle."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"- Well, you didn't want to derail the whole show,"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"but you did."
01:29:35;01:29:39;"- Just rolling over to some dude's house"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"and just like looking in the cupboard,"
01:29:41;01:29:45;"just like, bro, you still eat Mac and Cheese?"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Come on, man, let's go get you some Velveeta."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Come on, bro."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"- I'd be remiss if I didn't point out"
01:29:51;01:29:55;"that I tried Cheetos brand Mac and Cheese a few days ago."
01:29:55;01:29:58;"And at first I was delighted,"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"and then I was disgusted by the end of the meal."
01:30:01;01:30:02;"It made me feel very sick."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"- Wait, it was Flamin' Hot Cheetos Mac and Cheese?"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"- No, just not, no Flamin' Hot,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"just straight up Cheetos Mac and Cheese."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"The powder looked like Cheetos dust."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"- That's a missed opportunity."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"- I think the Flamin' Hot version does exist,"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"but I've always been a classic Cheetos fan."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"- It's better probably."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"- Seinfeld was updating the thread in real time."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"- It was a journey."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- And it went from good to bad to worse"
01:30:26;01:30:29;"in the course of about 90 minutes."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"- It tasted just like Cheetos,"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"and I thought that was great upon first bite,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"and then, I mean, I just felt so queasy by the end."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"But now we're really, we're so far off topic."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"- No, that's actually a big part"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"of the Johnny Depp Chester Cheeto movie."
01:30:44;01:30:48;"He's trying to launch a mac and cheese brand."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"It's the day of the big launch,"
01:30:50;01:30:54;"and then Joe Camel comes to town and kidnaps him,"
01:30:54;01:30:58;"and a whole, you know, hijinks ensue."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"All right, the number five song in 1995,"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"we're gonna make up for lost time."
01:31:01;01:31:04;"All for One, ""I Can Love You Like That,"""
01:31:04;01:31:05;"produced by David Foster."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:31:19;01:31:22;"- That's classic '90s, ""Nehu."""
01:31:22;01:31:23;"- Yeah."
01:31:23;01:31:27;"- This is interesting."
01:31:27;01:31:31;"So, All for One, they had a bigger hit than this,"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"which was ""I Swear."""
01:31:32;01:31:34;"That was a massive song."
01:31:34;01:31:38;"And both ""I Swear"" and this song, ""I Can Love You Like That,"""
01:31:38;01:31:42;"are covers of John Michael Montgomery,"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"who's a country guy."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"- Interesting."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"♪ Found me a kiss, Juliet ♪"
01:31:47;01:31:52;"♪ And all this time that you've been waiting ♪"
01:31:52;01:31:58;"♪ You don't have to wait no more ♪"
01:31:58;01:32:02;"♪ I can love you like that ♪"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"♪ I would make you my world ♪"

01:42:50;01:42:53;"is Shaggy a Jamaican dude"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"who maybe he moved to New York when he was like 10?"
01:42:56;01:42:59;"Does he maybe have Jamaican heritage?"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"What's the Shaggy story?"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"'Cause I've heard this."
01:43:01;01:43:04;"- Is he the guy that did the record with Sting?"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"- Yes."
01:43:05;01:43:08;"- Also, I think I just found that out when you said that."
01:43:08;01:43:09;"(laughing)"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"So, I don't know how I feel about this."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"- I've always been hearing this."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- Well, you know what's weird?"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"I'm noticing in the producer credits,"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"Robert Livingston and Sting International."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Is that a coincidence?"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"- Yeah, I think it's a coincidence."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"He worked with a producer named Sting International,"
01:43:23;01:43:27;"and then 20 years later, he made an album with Sting."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"- I'm watching an interview with him"
01:43:29;01:43:32;"where he begins with a,"
01:43:32;01:43:35;"it's in a recent one around the Sting stuff."
01:43:35;01:43:37;"And he starts off with, you know,"
01:43:37;01:43:41;"I'm Shaggy, you know, Mr. Boombastic, heavy patois."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"And then he immediately is like,"
01:43:42;01:43:45;"so let me tell you about this Sting collab."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"It is a full on-"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"- Really?"
01:43:48;01:43:48;"- Yes."
01:43:48;01:43:51;"- Matt, can you play us a little bit of this?"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"- Yo, this is Mr. Love-a-love-a-Boombastic"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"up front and personal."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"Atta Shaggy!"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"- So that's the Shaggy we know."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"- I think that being an ambassador for reggae,"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"it doesn't just fall in my hands."
01:44:03;01:44:06;"I think any artist that brings this music"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"of dancehall or reggae outside-"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"- No, that's-"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"- Now I'm hearing something."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"Now I'm hearing something."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"- Yeah, yeah, he has an accent."
01:44:13;01:44:14;"- Shaggy is Jamaican."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"He was born in Kingston."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"- Okay, I see."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"This is a conspiracy theory."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"- How old was he when he moved?"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"- He was 17 years old."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"He moved to Brooklyn."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Then he joined the military."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Then he was stationed in North Carolina for a while."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"And then he started making music."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"- Okay, so that explains it."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"Shaggy, you're a stand-up guy."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Yeah, I've always, 'cause I remember people"
01:44:37;01:44:40;"always telling me, ""Oh, you know, Shaggy's a fake-in-Jamaican."""
01:44:40;01:44:43;"That's a term that people used to use a lot."
01:44:43;01:44:44;"And this makes sense."
01:44:44;01:44:48;"When he speaks, he's got, he lived in two places,"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"so he's got like a slight accent,"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"a kind of unusual mix of two accents."
01:44:53;01:44:57;"He turns it up to 11 for the music, that's true."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"But it's not quite as wild as if you're like,"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"this guy has no connection to Jamaica."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"That would be insane."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"But as I've always--"
01:45:04;01:45:07;"- Well, I stand relatively corrected."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"But that is how I remember it growing up, you're right."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"The basic rumor--"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"- No, right, people were very concerned"

02:00:16;02:00:17;"- Of babe?"
02:00:17;02:00:20;"- Using baby as a term of endearment."
02:00:20;02:00:24;"That's the first sort of known use of it"
02:00:24;02:00:29;"where sugar appeared in 1930."
02:00:29;02:00:30;"So--"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"- So baby predates sugar."
02:00:32;02:00:36;"- Yeah, I'm sure that babe is just sort of a reaction"
02:00:36;02:00:39;"to that more Rat Packy baby, baby,"

02:01:41;02:01:43;"you know, like a few hundred people."
02:01:43;02:01:45;"So it's almost like, it was like a TED talky type thing."
02:01:45;02:01:47;"So it wasn't an intimate group"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"and he was one of the speakers"
02:01:49;02:01:53;"and he was sort of talking about his process."
02:01:53;02:01:57;"At the end, he was like, you know,"

02:02:20;02:02:23;"see me after my speech, go on a hike with me"
02:02:23;02:02:25;"and we'll get creative."
02:02:25;02:02:26;"- Whoa."
02:02:26;02:02:28;"- And I did, I have to think about it."
02:02:28;02:02:30;"I had this sort of moment with him afterwards"
02:02:30;02:02:31;"where we talked, he came up to me"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"'cause I was, didn't really know anyone at this event"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"and I was alone and he came up and just was like,"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"what's up man?"
02:02:37;02:02:39;"That, and I know I've told that Bieber story"

02:02:51;02:02:54;"- And Seal, he was at a TED Talk-esque event"
02:02:54;02:02:57;"with hundreds of people and he just saw you by yourself"
02:02:57;02:03:00;"and he just said, he just walked up to you and was like,"
02:03:00;02:03:03;"hey lonely man, what's your story?"
02:03:03;02:03:04;"- Yeah, yeah."
