00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back once again. On today's episode, we really explore classic rock."
00:06;00:12;"We're talking Grateful Dead, John Mellencamp, Jim Morrison, and Steve Miller."
00:12;00:20;"It's quite the episode. Buckle up and stay tuned. This is dot dot dot."
00:20;00:24;"Dot dot dot."
00:24;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. One."
00:32;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:38;00:45;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:45;00:52;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go."
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:10;01:14;"We were only there."
01:14;01:18;"Alright, Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:18;01:21;"Not a whole lot, man. Time Crisis '77."
01:21;01:24;"This is Time Crisis '77. So..."
01:24;01:26;"There's some symmetry there."
01:26;01:29;"Yeah, definitely some symmetry. That's the year you were born."
01:29;01:31;"The famous year for the Grateful Dead."
01:31;01:32;"Cornell show."
01:32;01:37;"That's right. Did you see that the Dead just dropped this gigantic box set?"
01:37;01:38;"No."
01:38;01:41;"You might be into it. It's the complete Pacific Northwest recordings."
01:41;01:42;"Oh my god."
01:42;01:44;"'73 to '74, I believe."
01:44;01:46;"So it's only two years."
01:46;01:51;"Well, I think in the box set, you're getting hours and hours of the full shows."
01:51;01:52;"Vinyl?"
01:52;01:53;"CDs?"
01:53;01:57;"That must be CDs and it comes with all little trinkets and this and that."
01:57;02:01;"There appears to be a 45 minute playing in the band."
02:01;02:03;"Oh wow, they go to the minor part."
02:03;02:05;"Yeah, maybe for like a solid 15."
02:05;02:09;"Yeah, because the song is D major, but then starting like mid-late 70s,"
02:09;02:13;"we go to this like extended D minor jam."
02:13;02:16;"Like no movement, just like a jam."
02:16;02:17;"Just go full minor."
02:17;02:19;"A jam in D minor for like, yeah, 15."
02:19;02:21;"45 is outlandish."
02:21;02:26;"Jerry just starts working in that F, that minor third."
02:26;02:27;"I guess, yeah."
02:27;02:31;"And then everybody falls on-- yeah, I didn't-- I'll have to set aside some time."
02:31;02:34;"That's rough stuff."
02:34;02:36;"That's rough stuff, folks."
02:36;02:39;"45 minutes playing."
02:39;02:42;"That's pushing it for even the most devout Deadheads."
02:42;02:45;"I just want to be clear about this for our non-Deadhead listeners."
02:45;02:49;"Playing in the band is a song, so we're talking about a 45 minute,"
02:49;02:54;"which is way beyond the typical Dead jam."
02:54;02:59;"Yeah, usually their songs are clocking in around like 8, sometimes like 10."
02:59;03:00;"8 to 12 minutes, yeah."
03:00;03:03;"Also, playing in the band is a cool song."
03:03;03:06;"I love the version on the first-- like the first version that was released,"
03:06;03:08;"which was on Skull and Roses."
03:08;03:09;"Good song."
03:09;03:11;"One of Bob's best."
03:11;03:12;"Yeah, it's just kind of a funny song."
03:12;03:13;"There's these really beautiful guitar parts."
03:13;03:16;"[singing]"
03:16;03:20;"In the beginning, but then the actual, like, verses of the song--"
03:20;03:21;"Throw it on."
03:21;03:23;"Let's just take this all the way."
03:23;03:25;"I think I've got to throw on this 45 minute--"
03:25;03:26;"Oh, my God."
03:26;03:27;"--playing in the band."
03:27;03:30;"First hour of the show today is going to be dedicated to--"
03:30;03:31;"That'd be kind of--"
03:31;03:33;"19 disc companion."
03:33;03:35;"Who wants CDs?"
03:35;03:36;"Some Deadheads."
03:36;03:38;"They're buying it for the box."
03:38;03:39;"It's an art objet."
03:39;03:40;"Yeah."
03:40;03:41;"An objet d'art."
03:41;03:42;"Yeah, I get it."
03:42;03:43;"You know--"
03:43;03:44;"Shout out to the Grateful Dead."
03:44;03:46;"I got a DM from somebody at Grateful Dead,"
03:46;03:49;"which, you know, definitely is not somebody in the band."
03:49;03:53;"Probably somebody who works for Rhino, who's in charge of their archives."
03:53;03:56;"But I got a DM on Instagram, although this is while I was in Japan,"
03:56;03:58;"so I was all turned around time-wise."
03:58;04:01;"So I got a DM, you know, I was pretty psyched."
04:01;04:03;"I saw the Grateful Dead slid in my DMs, and they were asking,"
04:03;04:08;"""Do you want to premiere a song from this, like, forthcoming box set?"""
04:08;04:09;"And then--"
04:09;04:10;"Looks like it's happening."
04:10;04:11;"Yeah, I missed it."
04:11;04:12;"I missed the window."
04:12;04:13;"I'm sorry."
04:13;04:14;"I put them in touch with my management."
04:14;04:15;"So shout out to whoever hit me up."
04:15;04:17;"They probably--I think they said they listen to Time Crisis,"
04:17;04:19;"so they knew there's a Dead connection."
04:19;04:20;"So shout out to them."
04:20;04:22;"Next time hit up Time Crisis."
04:22;04:23;"That's better than hitting me up."
04:23;04:26;"But they were like, ""Do you want to--would you like to premiere"
04:26;04:31;"this, like, 1974 Eyes of the World on your Instagram?"""
04:31;04:32;"And I was kind of like--"
04:32;04:33;"What?"
04:33;04:34;"So at first I was just like in Japan."
04:34;04:35;"I was like, ""Hell yeah!"""
04:35;04:38;"And then I thought about it, and I was like, ""Wait, what does it mean to premiere it?"""
04:38;04:40;"Surely there must be tapes out there."
04:40;04:43;"Richard Pictures has covered playing in the band a few times."
04:43;04:45;"How far do you take it?"
04:45;04:46;"We'll take it out."
04:46;04:49;"I think we've done, like, a good 10 or 12-minute version."
04:49;04:51;"And you always take it to the minor part?"
04:51;04:53;"Yeah, although I prefer not to."
04:53;04:56;"It's actually a bit of a bone of contention within the band."
04:56;04:57;"Really?"
04:57;05:01;"I like to do the strictly, like, 1970, '71 version,"
05:01;05:03;"kind of more like the country rock version."
05:03;05:08;"Yep, playing in the band live at the Heck Edmondson Pavilion."
05:08;05:09;"Where's that?"
05:09;05:12;"This is University of Washington, Seattle."
05:12;05:13;"Okay."
05:13;05:16;"This version's 46 minutes, 31 seconds."
05:16;05:17;"Wow."
05:17;05:20;"That'd be just so tight any time we don't feel like doing the whole show."
05:20;05:21;"We're just like--"
05:21;05:24;"And now we're going to throw to some music from The Grateful Dead."
05:24;05:28;"Here's a really hot rendition of playing in the band from--"
05:28;05:30;"And then we're just gone for 45 minutes."
05:30;05:32;"And then come back in like, ""Wow, that was--"""
05:32;05:33;"[laughs]"
05:33;05:54;"[playing in the band]"
05:54;05:56;"There's just like certain Dead songs that, from the jump,"
05:56;05:58;"are so vibey that you expect it."
05:58;06:00;"But it's like, you just heard this, and you're like,"
06:00;06:03;"""This is going to go on for 45 minutes."""
06:03;06:05;"[singing]"
06:05;06:07;"And the chorus is just so simple."
06:07;06:10;"Yeah, this is like a Buddy Holly song, kind of."
06:10;06:11;"Yeah."
06:11;06:13;"[playing in the band]"
06:13;06:15;"But then this part, this is the crunch."
06:15;06:18;"Okay, so what happens, this is in D major."
06:18;06:20;"Then they start doing this part in D minor."
06:20;06:21;"Right."
06:21;06:22;"[singing]"
06:22;06:23;"Like, whatever, like the--"
06:23;06:25;"You know what a song's in D major?"
06:25;06:26;"No."
06:26;06:28;"Cape Cod, ""Cuasa Cuasa."""
06:28;06:30;"Dude, go to a minor jam."
06:30;06:32;"We never took it minor."
06:32;06:33;"That's how you go 12 minute."
06:33;06:36;"We started taking it like vaguely mixolydian."
06:36;06:41;"I mean, also keep in mind, we barely played it."
06:41;06:43;"We've only had a few opportunities."
06:43;06:46;"Dude, this is the new version of the shirt/concept."
06:46;06:48;"45 minute Cape Cod."
06:48;06:56;"[playing in the band]"
06:56;06:59;"Daybreak on the land."
06:59;07:01;"I'm just going to skip ahead."
07:01;07:04;"Now we're at 11 minutes."
07:04;07:05;"This is kind of tight."
07:05;07:07;"I don't think we've ever just skipped around"
07:07;07:09;"in a Grateful Dead jam on this show."
07:09;07:11;"It's about time."
07:11;07:16;"[playing in the band]"
07:16;07:18;"Coizmoose is going off."
07:18;07:30;"[playing in the band]"
07:30;07:33;"Definitely getting some different territory."
07:33;07:35;"We've already descended into it."
07:35;07:37;"Yeah, it's pre-jazz."
07:37;07:43;"[playing in the band]"
07:43;07:45;"It's all good folks, we've got another 30 of this."
07:45;07:48;"[playing in the band]"
07:48;07:50;"Go forward to minute 18."
07:50;07:52;"University of Seattle."
07:52;07:54;"How are you doing?"
07:54;07:59;"[playing in the band]"
07:59;08:01;"Is this 18?"
08:01;08:03;"This is only 15."
08:03;08:08;"[playing in the band]"
08:08;08:11;"It's getting funky."
08:11;08:12;"Oh wow."
08:12;08:16;"Ooh, yeah."
08:16;08:20;"I want to hear Jerry just tearing it up."
08:20;08:27;"[playing in the band]"
08:27;08:29;"It's a little stop/start in the middle."
08:29;08:36;"[playing in the band]"
08:36;08:38;"You said minute 27."
08:38;08:48;"[playing in the band]"
08:48;08:50;"31."
08:50;08:59;"[playing in the band]"
08:59;09:02;"This part is getting back to some late 60s psychedelic vibe."
09:02;09:04;"Yeah."
09:04;09:08;"[playing in the band]"
09:08;09:09;"Minute 37."
09:09;09:11;"That was a harsh tone from Jerry."
09:11;09:13;"Almost reminded me of John McLaughlin or something."
09:13;09:15;"Yeah."
09:15;09:17;"[playing in the band]"
09:17;09:20;"Or like some early, yeah, early, early death."
09:20;09:22;"We're coming hot out of the gates on this show."
09:22;09:24;"We're at minute 37."
09:24;09:26;"[playing in the band]"
09:26;09:28;"Minute 41."
09:28;09:30;"[playing in the band]"
09:30;09:32;"So when they're going to jump back into it,"
09:32;09:43;"[playing in the band]"
09:43;09:45;"I feel like they're kind of hinting at it."
09:45;09:56;"[playing in the band]"
09:56;09:58;"I wonder if this song is just like,"
09:58;10:00;"it's just one of the discs."
10:00;10:08;"[playing in the band]"
10:08;10:11;"You can hear the keys a little more here."
10:11;10:22;"[playing in the band]"
10:22;10:24;"Okay, now here it's coming back."
10:24;10:30;"[playing in the band]"
10:30;10:33;"This is at minute 44."
10:33;10:35;"[playing in the band]"
10:35;10:37;"Ha ha, yeah!"
10:37;10:51;"[playing in the band]"
10:51;10:56;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
10:56;10:58;"Seinfeld got scared by that."
10:58;11:00;"That's Donna, right?"
11:00;11:02;"Seinfeld was terrified."
11:02;11:04;"Rough stuff, folks."
11:04;11:06;"Donna's rough."
11:06;11:08;"Come on, she's good."
11:08;11:10;"[playing in the band]"
11:10;11:28;"[playing in the band]"
11:28;11:30;"I like the thing about Donna just like,"
11:30;11:33;"fully leaving the stage during the jam,"
11:33;11:35;"and just like catching a full episode of like,"
11:35;11:37;"M*A*S*H or something."
11:37;11:40;"Ha ha, coming back."
11:40;11:48;"[playing in the band]"
11:48;11:54;"Just taking down a couple long-form articles in Esquire."
11:54;11:56;"Yeah."
11:56;12:06;"[playing in the band]"
12:06;12:08;"This part sounds great."
12:08;12:10;"Yeah."
12:10;12:21;"[playing in the band]"
12:21;12:23;"Phil."
12:23;12:25;"[laughing]"
12:25;12:27;"In the Phil zone."
12:27;12:32;"[playing in the band]"
12:32;12:37;"Phil's got some weird like, flange or something on his bass."
12:37;12:40;"Okay, so the official title of this box set is"
12:40;12:44;"Pacific Northwest '73 to '74, Believe It If You Need It."
12:44;12:47;"There's a box of rain, I know that's one of your favorite songs, Jake."
12:47;12:48;"Oh yeah."
12:48;12:50;"Anyway, so we saw each other last weekend."
12:50;12:51;"Yeah, man."
12:51;12:52;"Jake and I were at the same wedding."
12:52;12:54;"My brother, friend of the show."
12:54;12:56;"That's right, friend of the show Dave Longstreth tied the--"
12:56;12:58;"[laughing]"
12:58;12:59;"That's the morning news."
12:59;13:03;"Friend of the show Dave Longstreth tied the knot this past weekend"
13:03;13:05;"up in Northern California."
13:05;13:09;"Very exclusive private ceremony attended by only a few friends and family."
13:09;13:12;"No, there were like, I don't know, like 40-something people there."
13:12;13:13;"It was tight."
13:13;13:14;"I was guesstimating 50."
13:14;13:15;"Yeah, I think that's probably--"
13:15;13:16;"50 tops."
13:16;13:17;"Solid guess."
13:17;13:19;"First wedding you've been to since your own?"
13:19;13:22;"Are you--oh, you hit a lot of weddings with Hannah, your wife."
13:22;13:24;"It's true."
13:24;13:27;"I feel like you're always like, you go into like Wisconsin for the weekend for a wedding."
13:27;13:29;"Yeah, that did happen last summer."
13:29;13:31;"I feel like we hit one this summer."
13:31;13:33;"It was a lovely wedding, lovely ceremony."
13:33;13:35;"Yeah, powerful vows exchanged."
13:35;13:37;"And Jake, you gave the best speech at the wedding."
13:37;13:38;"That's one thing I want to talk about."
13:38;13:39;"Oh, thanks."
13:39;13:42;"Not that the other speeches were bad."
13:42;13:45;"It's just that one thing I noticed about this wedding,"
13:45;13:49;"one wedding I went to maybe two or three years ago was a lot of like Hollywood types."
13:49;13:54;"So there were like legit comedy writers getting up and just like one-upping each other."
13:54;13:55;"Like world-class performers."
13:55;13:56;"World-class performers."
13:56;13:58;"Wow, that's just fun to witness."
13:58;14:01;"And just roasting the bride and groom or whatever."
14:01;14:04;"But at this wedding, you're the only person who went for kind of like--"
14:04;14:06;"and maybe that's what the brother is supposed to do,"
14:06;14:10;"like that right mix of like praise, little bit of humor."
14:10;14:12;"Although you didn't really do actually any light ribbing."
14:12;14:13;"No, no ribbing."
14:13;14:15;"There was some humor, but no like--"
14:15;14:17;"No embarrassing stories."
14:17;14:18;"No busting."
14:18;14:20;"My dad was kind of busting."
14:20;14:21;"In a dad way."
14:21;14:23;"Yeah, you told a nice story about how--"
14:23;14:24;"Yeah."
14:24;14:25;"What did you say?"
14:25;14:28;"You just always knew Dave had a lot of gumption because he carried a canoe on his back for a mile."
14:28;14:30;"Yeah, like we went to this summer camp when we were kids,"
14:30;14:36;"and like you try to like compete and like do stuff to get these funny little awards when you're at summer camp."
14:36;14:41;"But a lot of it is like sort of like swim a mile or like get this score in archery."
14:41;14:44;"Like very like classic summer camp stuff."
14:44;14:49;"And one of the things that Dave took upon himself to do was portage a canoe."
14:49;14:50;"This is when he was like 12 or 13."
14:50;14:54;"Right, I found your speech interesting because I wasn't familiar with the phrase ""portage a canoe."""
14:54;14:58;"Right, I actually explained it to everyone because I sensed in the room on the cuff that I was like,"
14:58;15:01;"""Hmm, maybe portage a canoe is not in everyone's lexicon."""
15:01;15:07;"Now we've all portaged a canoe, but how many of us have portaged a canoe for one mile at the age of 11?"
15:08;15:10;"What's up? How's it going?"
15:10;15:12;"Do your real cheat form"
15:12;15:14;"She is so dreamy"
15:14;15:17;"Like she got features on Fellini"
15:17;15:19;"Deadpan, unimpressed"
15:19;15:21;"Archimedes, I'm obsessed"
15:21;15:23;"Just hanging out"
15:23;15:26;"Or Julian Casablanca"
15:26;15:28;"She is an epiphany"
15:28;15:30;"Of her electricity"
15:30;15:32;"Opens my days"
15:32;15:35;"Like she always knew"
15:35;15:38;"I'm feeling up in a tank"
15:38;15:40;"I'm emmited deadly"
15:40;15:44;"In all the ways she's a race through"
15:44;15:46;"Yeah, no, so what is portaging a canoe again?"
15:46;15:50;"It's carrying a canoe solo over land."
15:50;15:53;"But portaging is also a very specific style."
15:53;15:57;"It's like the canoe's flipped over so you're like, it's resting."
15:57;16:01;"Yeah, so like the cross braces in the middle of the canoe"
16:01;16:05;"That you might like sit on, or that might form the like"
16:05;16:09;"Butcher thing to like form the seat that you would sit on if you're paddling a canoe"
16:09;16:12;"Those cross braces are then put on your shoulders."
16:12;16:14;"And that's kind of part of the design?"
16:14;16:19;"Yeah, because like there's situations where you're having to go from one body of water to the other."
16:19;16:23;"You gotta take it from this lake to some other lake."
16:23;16:26;"Today's time crisis, we're talking canoe portaging."
16:26;16:29;"Give us a call, let us know how you like to portage your canoes."
16:29;16:33;"There's the Wisconsin method."
16:33;16:35;"Have you ever done a canoe hiking trip?"
16:35;16:36;"I have."
16:36;16:38;"So you had to portage it sometimes?"
16:38;16:40;"Yes, when I was a kid at camp."
16:40;16:42;"God, it sounds intense."
16:42;16:45;"And you would like, you'd have all your gear in like a waterproof backpack."
16:45;16:46;"Right."
16:46;16:47;"That's in the canoe."
16:47;16:50;"And then you like are canoeing across this huge lake in like Maine."
16:50;16:51;"Yeah."
16:51;16:55;"Then you get to the shore and then there's another lake that starts"
16:55;16:59;"because there's areas like in Maine called the Rangeley Lakes that have like lots of lakes."
16:59;17:02;"Or like Minnesota, land of a thousand lakes."
17:02;17:04;"So the lakes are like separated."
17:04;17:07;"I bet Minnesota, they're portaging canoes all day."
17:07;17:08;"Left and right."
17:08;17:09;"Yeah."
17:09;17:14;"So then you're like, oh, it's three quarters of a mile or it's three miles to the next lake."
17:14;17:15;"Yeah."
17:15;17:19;"We got to go from Lake Elmhurst to this other lake."
17:19;17:20;"Boom, on your shoulders."
17:20;17:22;"It's like a roller blade to work."
17:22;17:25;"Then you got to take your roller blades off because you can't wear them in the lobby."
17:25;17:28;"Then you got to sling them around your shoulders when you get in the elevator."
17:28;17:30;"You're sort of portaging your roller blades."
17:30;17:32;"Or if you ride your bike to the subway."
17:32;17:33;"Right."
17:33;17:35;"And then you have to get off the bike and take it in the subway."
17:35;17:36;"You're kind of portaging your bike."
17:36;17:41;"You know what's so stressful is when people put the bike on the rack on the front of the bus."
17:41;17:42;"Oh, yeah."
17:42;17:43;"Do you see that?"
17:43;17:46;"Like the city bus vibe and there's like a huge bike rack."
17:46;17:51;"But I never understand how it works with like if other people put their bike on top of yours"
17:51;17:53;"and then you're the next stop."
17:53;17:56;"And then you have to like find the guy that put his bike on top of yours."
17:56;17:57;"You know what I'm saying?"
17:57;17:59;"And it's all happening while the bus is idling at a bus stop."
17:59;18:00;"Yeah."
18:00;18:03;"And you can just picture all these other people who obviously this is not entirely true."
18:03;18:10;"But I feel like in New York there's a slight thing that the people who bike and then get on the bus"
18:10;18:13;"probably have a little more time on their hands than everybody else."
18:13;18:14;"Maybe that's not fair."
18:14;18:15;"I just feel like in broad strokes."
18:15;18:16;"Wait, why?"
18:16;18:22;"I guess I'm just picturing like who's like an older person still working, sitting on the bus waiting."
18:22;18:27;"And then I'm just picturing just like me basically just being like, hold up, hold up."
18:27;18:29;"Got to secure my bike."
18:29;18:31;"And just like everybody, you know what I mean?"
18:31;18:33;"Sort of like a Ned Flanders kind of move."
19:33;19:37;"Here's an article from paddling.com called the pain of portaging."
19:37;19:39;"And here's a quote from Bill Mason."
19:39;19:44;"Anyone who tells you portaging is fun is either a liar or crazy."
19:44;19:46;"I agree fully with this."
19:46;19:48;"Let's face it, portaging really hurts."
19:48;19:53;"Whether you are carrying over from one lake to another or avoiding a set of nasty rapids,"
19:53;19:57;"each trail has some painful characteristics, slippery rocks, steep inclines, bug infested hollows,"
19:57;20:00;"boot sucking mud, and many wrong turns."
20:00;20:04;"And there's always that particular canoe mate who never seems to take their share of the load."
20:04;20:08;"Okay, so there's a lot to unpack in the world of portaging."
20:08;20:11;"This is precisely why I told the portaging story."
20:11;20:16;"Okay, so now I really get it that it's portaging."
20:16;20:18;"I was like this kid is cut from a different cloth."
20:18;20:23;"Portaging represents taking pain unto yourself to achieve something great."
20:23;20:24;"Sheer determination and grit."
20:24;20:26;"To make it from one body of water to the next."
20:26;20:29;"I was saying Dave has a very powerful work ethic."
20:29;20:31;"How old was he when he won the portaging award?"
20:31;20:33;"I don't know, 12 or 13?"
20:33;20:34;"Right."
20:34;20:39;"But I also mentioned that when we were kids, like some 12 or 13 year old dudes are like young men."
20:39;20:40;"Right."
20:40;20:42;"But we were like shrimps. We were like true."
20:42;20:44;"Oh, you're just talking about body type."
20:44;20:45;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
20:45;20:47;"Oh, yeah, that was a funny part of the thing."
20:47;20:51;"You said that the long shirt boys were true 98 pound weaklings."
20:51;20:53;"Yeah, bean poles."
20:53;20:55;"You missed the night before the wedding."
20:55;20:57;"There was a slide show that my dad put together."
20:57;21:00;"And there were a lot of photographs of me and Dave."
21:00;21:06;"And when I was a teenager, into my 20s, I looked malnourished."
21:06;21:07;"Really?"
21:07;21:09;"I was deeply underweight."
21:09;21:10;"And it was just like--"
21:10;21:11;"Into your 20s."
21:12;21:17;"So even when you were at college, slamming brews, late night pizza slices, you--"
21:17;21:19;"Yeah, metabolism just tore through it."
21:19;21:21;"You're just one of those lucky guys."
21:21;21:25;"Well, but it really wasn't like-- I didn't look good."
21:25;21:28;"Especially also in the '90s, like the clothes were sort of baggy."
21:28;21:37;"So a combination of just being like a super thin, pale, kind of like gaunt dude with like baggy clothes, like 1998."
21:37;21:39;"Rough stuff, folks."
21:39;21:42;"Pictures of my college era, it's just brutal."
21:42;21:48;"It's hard to like wax nostalgic about college when you look back at the photos of you and you're just like, ""Jesus Christ."""
21:48;21:50;"I was at my max weight in college, actually."
21:50;21:52;"I actually remember seeing a photo of you a while ago."
21:52;21:54;"Maybe-- Oh, well, that's when I met you."
21:54;21:55;"Yeah."
21:55;21:56;"Like when we did that tour."
21:56;22:00;"And I was like, ""Damn, Ezra looks pudgy."""
22:00;22:04;"I think it was like a photo from like when we played at like some place in Baltimore or something."
22:04;22:05;"It's gone up and down."
22:05;22:07;"Yeah, because I recently got a scale."
22:07;22:08;"Congratulations."
22:08;22:17;"I just felt like the truth, I've not been eating well at all lately, which doesn't bode well for any forthcoming Vampire Weekend press or things of that nature."
22:17;22:18;"You know what's cool?"
22:18;22:20;"You know how I talk about how nobody likes the doors anymore?"
22:20;22:21;"Yeah."
22:21;22:25;"I was, you know, just researching the doors as one does."
22:25;22:29;"And I always think about too how like in this era when--"
22:29;22:37;"Obviously, we talk so much in this era about who's saying the right thing, who's saying the right thing now, but they said the wrong thing before."
22:37;22:40;"You know, like people digging up old tweets from somebody from five years ago."
22:40;22:42;"""See, I knew you're a piece of s--t."""
22:42;22:45;"I'm not commenting on it, but, you know, we know that's been going on."
22:45;22:53;"But, you know, I always think about the people who just said the right thing decades ago when it wasn't particularly fashionable, when you weren't getting props for it."
22:53;22:59;"So I even think about how even in my lifetime, the word fat shaming only kind of came into prominence."
22:59;23:01;"I'm sure it's existed for a long time."
23:01;23:09;"But I don't remember being a kid and being in school and people talk about being nice to each other and they would say, ""Don't be mean to an overweight person because
you're fat shaming."""
23:09;23:10;"That just word wasn't around."
23:10;23:11;"Yeah."
23:11;23:15;"Anybody with a heart knew that it was cruel to make fun of anybody for their appearance or whatever."
23:15;23:23;"But my point is that I just feel like back in the day, as recently as 10 years ago because I was recently watching the Eddie Murphy film Norbit."
23:23;23:25;"I don't know why, but I wanted to watch Norbit."
23:25;23:27;"And I realized later it's because I thought it was Bowfinger."
23:27;23:32;"Because I know that there are Eddie Murphy movies from the same era where he kind of plays a nerd."
23:32;23:35;"And I was like, ""I've heard that that movie is good."""
23:35;23:37;"And then somehow I thought it was Norbit."
23:37;23:41;"And so Norbit, almost all the jokes are about him playing an overweight woman."
23:41;23:43;"So it's like just really absurd stuff."
23:43;23:46;"Like she goes on a water slide and then she goes bust through a wall."
23:46;23:48;"Just kind of like you're just like, ""What?"""
23:48;23:51;"Just feels so dated and it's only like 12, 13 years ago."
23:51;23:57;"So I was really interested when I came across this Jim Morrison interview on YouTube."
23:57;23:59;"And he died in the early '70s."
23:59;24:00;"Yeah."
24:00;24:04;"So Jim Morrison, he was known as somebody who publicly dealt with his weight."
24:04;24:07;"I don't even want to say dealt with his weight because who knows what he thought about it."
24:07;24:09;"But when he came out, he had a very specific look."
24:09;24:14;"And then later, you know, some people would joke about, ""Oh, then when he got on drugs, then he got fat."""
24:14;24:17;"So, you know, that was the thing people talked about Jim Morrison."
24:17;24:19;"But here's this interview that I found."
24:19;24:20;"Early '70s."
24:20;24:22;"You put on a lot of weight. Are you eating a lot?"
24:22;24:23;"So did you hear that, what the interviewer said?"
24:23;24:25;"Yeah, yeah. You put on a lot of weight. Are you eating a lot?"
24:25;24:26;"Yeah."
24:26;24:28;"Okay, so this is from 1969, by the way."
24:28;24:36;"Well, you know, that's something that really bothers me."
24:36;24:39;"What's wrong with being fat?"
24:39;24:40;"That's what I want to know."
24:40;24:41;"Why is there such--"
24:41;24:43;"I didn't say there was anything wrong with it."
24:43;24:47;"Why is it so onerous to be fat?"
24:47;24:52;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
24:52;24:55;"I felt like a tank, you know?"
24:55;25:02;"I felt like a large mammal, a big beast."
25:02;25:11;"When I moved through the corridors or across the lawn, I just feel like I could knock anybody out of my way, you know?"
25:11;25:12;"I was solid, man."
25:12;25:13;"Is this part real?"
25:13;25:17;"It's terrible to be thin and wispy because--"
25:17;25:18;"I think so."
25:18;25:22;"You could get knocked over by a strong wind or something."
25:22;25:24;"I guess he's kind of skinny-shaming."
25:24;25:26;"Fat is beautiful."
25:26;25:28;"How much do you weigh now?"
25:28;25:30;"I don't know, to tell you the truth."
25:30;25:34;"I guess somewhere in the neighborhood of about 150."
25:34;25:35;"More than that, buddy."
25:35;25:37;"Well, maybe he was short."
25:37;25:39;"Completely crapping on his point."
25:39;25:40;"Yeah, I don't know."
25:40;25:45;"Okay, when I hear the whole thing in context, he's kind of going off some deep ends."
25:45;25:46;"I'm just saying--"
25:46;25:47;"I thought it was--"
25:47;25:50;"But on a very basic level, 1969, when I think about--"
25:50;25:51;"Oh, a beast, man."
25:51;25:55;"Yeah, he got vibey, but I just feel like in the '90s, there was so--"
25:55;26:00;"You know, late-night talk show hosts, whoever they used to make fun of, like Ricky Lake or whatever."
26:00;26:04;"In the '90s, people were allowed to just make fun of people being fat all the time and people--"
26:04;26:07;"I don't know, Kirstie, Kirstie Alley, Oprah, that was a thing."
26:07;26:08;"Delta Burke."
26:08;26:09;"Delta Burke, yep."
26:09;26:15;"So there was so much men talking about women being fat and to a lesser extent talking about men being fat"
26:15;26:20;"and nobody ever really questioning the joke, whereas now you see there's a more serious conversation about it."
26:20;26:21;"It's like, what's the problem?"
26:21;26:25;"But I'm just saying, 1969, he didn't just say, ""Leave me alone, man."""
26:25;26:29;"He literally paused for a second and just said, ""What's everybody's [bleep] problem with this?"
26:29;26:31;"What's so wrong with being fat?"
26:31;26:33;"Why is this notable?"""
26:33;26:37;"And then he kind of tried to turn it into this, you know, thing, ""I feel powerful."""
26:37;26:41;"But just the fact that he started it that way, didn't that strike you as a little ahead of his time?"
26:41;26:42;"Oh, totally."
26:42;26:46;"I just feel like somebody else might have been just on some, like, ""You know what, man?"
26:46;26:50;"Leave me alone,"" but he just really paused and was like, ""Let's examine what's happening here."
26:50;26:52;"You find it so notable that I've gained some weight."
26:52;26:53;"Who cares?"
26:53;26:57;"What is this obsession with why is it so bad to be fat?"""
26:57;27:00;"And I just don't know, 1969, a little bit ahead of his time."
27:52;27:55;"You know, it's also not like he was on, like, social media or something."
27:55;27:57;"This is clearly, like, a not very famous interview."
27:57;28:01;"I don't think, like, immediately people went up to Jim Morrison and were just like, ""Thank you."""
28:01;28:03;"You know, he wasn't part of a movement or anything."
28:03;28:06;"He was just, like, a dude speaking his mind, a guy who gained a little weight in a year and said,"
28:06;28:10;"""Yeah, what is this societal obsession with fat being such a bad thing?"
28:10;28:11;"I think there's positives to it."""
28:11;28:12;"It struck me."
28:12;28:15;"You know who I could see doing that now?"
28:15;28:16;"Who?"
28:16;28:17;"Eminem."
28:17;28:18;"Couldn't you see that?"
28:18;28:19;"Well, I know he struggled with his weight."
28:19;28:20;"He's talked about it."
28:20;28:21;"Right."
28:21;28:24;"There was that story that he was, like, at a McDonald's or something, and people were like,"
28:24;28:26;"he could overhear the table next to him being like, ""Yo, is that Eminem?"
28:26;28:27;"Yo, is that him?"""
28:27;28:28;"He said, ""No, he's too big."
28:28;28:29;"He's too fat."""
28:29;28:30;"Yeah, he's too fat."
28:30;28:32;"But that encouraged him to, like, start losing weight and working out."
28:32;28:33;"Right."
28:33;28:35;"But what if he was just, like, just got all Morrison on it?"
28:35;28:36;"But you know what?"
28:36;28:41;"Actually, when I think about it, when Kanye was kind of in the news a lot, I guess he still is,"
28:41;28:46;"of course this got overshadowed by the far more controversial Trump stuff."
28:46;28:53;"Well, remember he went on TMZ, and the big takeaway was that he said this absurd slavery is a choice thing,"
28:53;28:58;"which he was widely denounced for, but also, I think, in the same interview."
28:58;29:01;"So obviously that's a pretty nutty thing to say."
29:01;29:08;"But within that same interview, he also said something where he was talking about the ways in which his life has been compromised"
29:08;29:13;"by the cruelty of the public or the world or the press or something."
29:13;29:14;"Right."
29:14;29:16;"And one of the things he said was, like, that it kind of went by quickly."
29:16;29:21;"He said, ""Yeah, because I had to go get liposuction because I didn't want to be made fun of the way you guys did Rob Kardashian,"
29:21;29:27;"who's his brother-in-law,"" which, again, people -- so much of the conversation around this was, ""Oh, crazy Kanye."""
29:27;29:31;"But nobody paused for a second to say, you know, if you gave him the benefit of the doubt, you're like,"
29:31;29:39;"""This is a dude who's a man who is publicly admitting, even in these supposedly woke times,"
29:39;29:46;"I've watched a family member suffer so much because of how people talked about his appearance and his weight"
29:46;29:53;"that I myself was terrified of what people might say about me, and I'm supposedly this very confident guy, Kanye, famously confident,"
29:53;29:57;"and I went and got surgery not because it made me feel good."""
29:57;30:02;"You know, it'd be one thing if Kanye said, you know, you could say plastic surgery makes some people feel good,"
30:02;30:04;"if that's their choice, but he didn't say it that way."
30:04;30:09;"He said, ""I had to go do this because I was so scared of, like, the cruelty that might be enacted upon me."""
30:09;30:12;"Do you think he was referring to social media?"
30:12;30:16;"I'm sure that's part of life, being like, ""Yo, dude, like, I'm worried about you. You should --"""
30:16;30:18;"I remember there were some pictures that came out."
30:18;30:20;"That'd be pretty dark of just Kim."
30:20;30:22;"Yeah."
30:22;30:26;"I don't know. The way he was talking, he used the word ""y'all,"" and he was gesturing to TMZ,"
30:26;30:29;"representative of the spectacle, the public, the press."
30:29;30:32;"Like, crappy gossip media."
30:32;30:33;"Seinfeld, what were you saying?"
30:33;30:39;"Oh, just how a few months before that, some pictures of him looking bigger than we'd ever seen him came out,"
30:39;30:43;"and it was like a day of Twitter bashing him, too. I remember that."
30:43;30:44;"Bummer."
30:44;30:47;"Nobody wants to be made fun of, and that's such a low blow that people do."
30:47;30:53;"So, anyway, my larger point here is just that if in 2018 Kanye, a rock star of our generation --"
30:53;30:56;"I'm saying all this while I'm still chewing my pizza --"
30:56;31:00;"is getting surgery not because that's exactly what he wants to do,"
31:00;31:06;"but because he's so terrified of the societal pressure that being fat is associated with being a bad person, whatever,"
31:06;31:10;"then Jim Morrison was really ahead of his time in 1969 to say this."
31:10;31:13;"I also just like his calm demeanor. I want to play the beginning again."
31:13;31:18;"You put on a lot of weight eating a lot."
31:18;31:21;"Well, um..."
31:21;31:23;"Well..."
31:23;31:27;"You know, that's something that really bothers me."
31:27;31:33;"What's wrong with being fat? That's what I want to know. Why is there such..."
31:33;31:35;"I didn't say there was anything wrong with it."
31:35;31:40;"Why is it so onerous to be fat? Um..."
31:40;31:42;"I love his speaking voice."
31:42;31:44;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
31:44;31:45;"Maybe Jim Morrison..."
31:45;31:47;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
31:47;31:50;"I also just feel like it's just interesting to me."
31:50;31:55;"It's like the '60s were also this time when people were at least partially waking up to certain injustices."
31:55;31:56;"Yeah."
31:56;31:58;"Racism, Vietnam War, sexism."
31:58;32:05;"And you can just feel like at that time, I'm sure, already, you know, fat shaming for a lot of activist types"
32:05;32:07;"was probably so low down the priority list."
32:07;32:08;"Sure."
32:08;32:11;"I don't think it is anymore. People tend to look at this stuff more holistically."
32:11;32:14;"But in 1969, I just think for him to pause..."
32:14;32:19;"I just think it's cool for him to pause and just be like, ""Yeah, what's wrong with being fat?"""
32:19;32:21;"Jake, you're an artist."
32:21;32:26;"Hundreds of years ago, wasn't being overweight kind of a status symbol?"
32:26;32:28;"You see all these Elizabethan..."
32:28;32:31;"Yeah, I've heard that. Yeah, you see those portraits from like the 18th century."
32:31;32:33;"People looking thick."
32:33;32:41;"The ideal of female beauty then was, by today's standards, plump, for sure."
32:41;32:46;"People are always going to suffer as long as there is an ideal of beauty, man."
32:46;32:52;"I wonder how closely related to like economic status this stuff is."
32:52;32:57;"Because if you're thinking about 18th century paintings, it's sort of like the people that were really thin"
32:57;33:02;"were probably like starving peasants, serfs, plebeians."
33:02;33:07;"And the people that were rich, that had idle time and extra food,"
33:07;33:12;"they showed it with their bodies and it was like, ""Oh, that's beautiful."""
33:12;33:14;"It's like, that's stable and affluent."
33:14;33:19;"I wonder if there's a reverse engineering that's happening now."
33:19;33:23;"It's the same thing people say about suntans, that that has gone back and forth"
33:23;33:29;"because there would have been a historical moment when to be an aristocrat meant you didn't have to go outside."
33:29;33:31;"Right, you were pale. Yeah."
33:31;33:36;"You didn't have to be pale, whereas out here in the fields, we fight for our meals."
33:36;33:39;"If you were working in the sun all day, you'd be tan."
33:39;33:42;"Nice Baba reference. Thank you."
33:42;33:49;"And then people say, well, eventually that standard shifted when sometimes people associate it with Coco Chanel"
33:49;33:55;"and saying that when certain kind of high status people might come back from the beach,"
33:55;33:57;"then suddenly it's like, ""Oh, damn, you can get a tan."""
33:57;34:00;"Maybe it's actually better than lazing around in the house."
34:00;34:04;"Lazing around at the beach and getting a tan is even more nice."
34:04;34:08;"And increasingly, the working stiffs of the world were indoors."
34:08;34:09;"Exactly. You're right."
34:09;34:14;"They were going from the toiling in the fields to toiling in factories"
34:14;34:18;"with only the flicker of one of Mr. Edison's new bulbs."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah, things come and go."
34:19;34:22;"This has like a Ken Burns doc feel to it."
34:22;34:28;"He could explore Adam Curtis and Ken Burns team up for the first time."
34:28;34:30;"Or talk about fat shaming."
34:30;34:34;"History of image, self-image and fashion."
34:34;34:37;"This is so time crisis, so half-baked."
34:37;34:41;"Who's doing the voiceover? Because doesn't Ken Burns do the voiceover?"
34:41;34:42;"Eminem does it."
34:42;34:45;"Ken Burns does it. Oh, Eminem. That'd be cool."
34:45;34:49;"I do think that because women are so, so shamed,"
34:49;34:52;"understandably there's a little less conversation about"
34:52;34:56;"the kind of crazy body image stuff that men have as well."
34:56;35:01;"And I don't know, the fact that rock stars from Jim Morrison and Kanye"
35:01;35:02;"have been sweating it."
35:02;35:07;"I mean, I got to scale partially because I wanted to have some sense of how much I weighed."
35:07;35:09;"Because like I was saying, I was at my max weight in college."
35:09;35:15;"I more or less stay in a range, but I do feel like I do look very different in pictures."
35:15;35:17;"That's partially why I hate taking pictures."
35:17;35:20;"You know, just sometimes you feel more ready to take a picture and sometimes you don't."
35:20;35:24;"Do you mean like rando fans of the band are like, ""Hey, can I get a picture?"""
35:24;35:27;"Or do you mean even if you're just hanging with friends and family,"
35:27;35:29;"and someone's like, ""Hey, Thanksgiving, let's take a picture."""
35:29;35:33;"And you're just like, ""What's wrong with being fat?"""
35:33;35:38;"No, I'm talking more like when I have to take, when I know that I have to go do press."
35:38;35:41;"And I haven't done very much over the past five years."
35:41;35:45;"But just like knowing, I've definitely had the experience of just kind of like"
35:45;35:50;"living my life and eating how I want and then being like,"
35:50;35:53;"""Oh, by the way, they want to do like a photo shoot in two days."""
35:53;35:57;"And just like have this slight flicker of anxiety in my head, just like a mind-fighting shape."
35:57;36:00;"And you know, if I was like really woke, I wouldn't--"
36:00;36:03;"I'd be like, ""Well, this is how I look right now in this moment,"" and take a picture."
36:03;36:06;"And that's one way I look. And you know, if I--"
36:06;36:08;"Grow a beard, dude. Go full Morrison."
36:08;36:10;"I know, I can't grow enough of a beard. That helps."
36:45;36:48;"You know who I could see kind of being Morrison style?"
36:48;36:49;"Who? Besides Eminem?"
36:49;36:51;"Father John Misty."
36:51;36:52;"Oh, yeah. Father John Misty."
36:52;36:53;"He kind of has that vibe."
36:53;36:54;"Like he-- I mean--"
36:54;36:55;"Well, he's a very slim man."
36:55;36:59;"I know, but he has a-- like Jim Morrison's demeanor in that interview."
36:59;37:00;"And they look kind of similar, too."
37:00;37:02;"Kind of reminded me of FJM."
37:02;37:07;"But if he put on a bunch of pounds and then someone's like, ""So, what's that guy's name?"""
37:07;37:08;"Father John?"
37:08;37:09;"Yeah. Oh, Josh?"
37:09;37:10;"So Josh."
37:10;37:14;"So, Mr. Tillman, it seems like you put on a few."
37:14;37:17;"What's wrong with really slow, deliberate delivery?"
37:17;37:18;"I also love the fact that he starts off--"
37:18;37:19;"What's wrong with--"
37:19;37:22;"I think also the one thing that also gets me is that he pauses and says,"
37:22;37:25;"""You know, this is something that really bothers me."""
37:25;37:27;"He's really taking a stand here."
37:27;37:30;"He's not just being like, ""Ugh, you know, man, I don't like that question."""
37:30;37:32;"He really pauses. He deliberates and says--"
37:32;37:34;"He's not nervous. He's not panicked."
37:34;37:37;"""This question that you just asked me, I've thought about it before."
37:37;37:39;"It bothers me on a fundamental level."""
37:39;37:42;"And he doesn't-- Yeah, because he doesn't make it personal."
37:42;37:45;"That's what's interesting. He doesn't say like, ""What's your problem, man? Leave me alone."""
37:45;37:46;"That's what Eminem would do."
37:46;37:48;"Yeah. ""Now you call me fat?"""
37:48;37:51;"Jim Morrison is actually like pauses and thinks about the world for a second."
37:51;37:52;"Wow."
37:52;37:54;"""This really bothers me."""
37:54;37:59;"I got to say, I'm picturing myself this weekend going down a Jim Morrison interview--"
37:59;38:00;"Interview hole."
38:00;38:02;"--YouTube. Did you watch others?"
38:02;38:04;"No. I think this one just popped up."
38:04;38:06;"I had kind of a breakthrough just right now of like--"
38:06;38:07;"Yeah. That he's kind of cool."
38:07;38:09;"Oh, Jim Morrison was cool."
38:09;38:11;"It's easy to like bag on the doors."
38:11;38:13;"Because people kind of talk about Jim Morrison like--"
38:13;38:15;"Basically like he was a goofball."
38:15;38:18;"Or he's like a pretentious, kind of not very talented poet or something."
38:18;38:20;"Right. I feel like for a while there was kind of--"
38:20;38:23;"If you think about some of the icons of the '60s, they'd be like,"
38:23;38:26;"""Now John Lennon was smart. He knew how the world worked."
38:26;38:28;"Jim Morrison was probably off."""
38:28;38:30;"And I'm kind of like, ""I never heard of John Lennon."""
38:30;38:33;"I'm sure John Lennon took a stand on other things, but I'm like, ""I don't know."""
38:33;38:36;"He just wrote better songs. That's why we love him more."
38:36;38:39;"The crystal ship is being filled."
38:39;38:41;"I mean, the doors have--"
38:41;38:42;"They have some good ones."
38:42;38:43;"They had quite a run."
38:43;38:47;"Yeah. He really started an archetype too, Morrison."
38:47;38:49;"Yeah. There is something when you hear his speaking voice,"
38:49;38:53;"it makes you like pause and be like, ""There's more to this guy for sure."""
38:53;38:54;"So how do we get down this rabbit hole?"
38:54;38:56;"Are we talking about my brother's wedding presentation?"
38:56;38:59;"Yeah, no, because you were talking about how you guys were total bean poles."
38:59;39:00;"Right."
39:00;39:04;"So the idea of Dave portaging a canoe, just a 12-year-old bean pole--"
39:04;39:05;"Yeah."
39:05;39:06;"--showed you that he had some grit."
39:06;39:11;"Yep. Told that story, and then the determination that was on display"
39:11;39:14;"was shortly thereafter put into music."
39:14;39:16;"You quoted the dead."
39:16;39:17;"I did."
39:17;39:18;"And I've been thinking about that because--"
39:18;39:20;"I saw Dave's face when I was like, ""And you know what?"
39:20;39:22;"I'll just quote the great Jerry Garcia."""
39:22;39:24;"And I was just being like, ""Oh my God."""
39:24;39:26;"But then I said, ""They love each other."
39:26;39:28;"Lord, you can see that it's true."""
39:28;39:30;"They love each other."
39:30;39:33;"Lord, you can see that it's true."
39:33;39:35;"I think that's such a nice sentiment."
39:35;39:39;"I do think that there is--I can only think of a couple songs."
39:39;39:42;"They love each other, which was a Jerry solo song originally, right?"
39:42;39:43;"Yeah."
39:43;39:44;"That the dead played a lot."
39:44;39:46;"And there's a couple kink songs."
39:46;39:48;"Oh, and also there's like a zombie song."
39:48;39:49;"What's a zombie song?"
39:49;39:50;"Basically what I'm--"
39:50;39:52;"Like the classic wedding one?"
39:52;39:54;"This will be our year."
39:54;39:55;"No, not even that one."
39:55;39:57;"I'm basically thinking about songs that are--"
39:57;40:00;"And I've been thinking about this a lot, even in my own life."
40:00;40:02;"Songs that are about other people--"
40:02;40:04;"Observing people in love?"
40:04;40:06;"Yeah, basically observing people in love"
40:06;40:11;"and how so much of our society, our society, man,"
40:11;40:17;"tells us that all of life is about finding love"
40:17;40:21;"and that most songs are about the singer looking for love,"
40:21;40:23;"experiencing love, experiencing heartbreak."
40:23;40:24;"Right."
40:24;40:27;"And that occupies a very, very high percentage of all songs ever written."
40:27;40:29;"It's all first-person narrative."
40:29;40:33;"Yeah, or if there is a story, a song that's about people in love,"
40:33;40:35;"it's just kind of telling the story of their love."
40:35;40:38;"It's not that triangulation of being like, ""I'm a person here"
40:38;40:41;"""and watching other people in love gives me positive feelings too."
40:41;40:43;"""It's nice to know that other people are in love."""
40:43;40:46;"And I was thinking about that, that it's just weird that there's not more about--"
40:46;40:49;"Very specific experience of observing people close to you"
40:49;40:51;"and they're giving off great vibes."
40:51;40:54;"Which is definitely part of a wedding."
40:54;40:55;"Okay, what's the--"
40:55;40:58;"♫ Lord, you know they made a fine connection ♫"
40:58;41:00;"♫ They love each other ♫"
41:00;41:02;"Oh, yeah, track 11 on Odyssey and Oracle."
41:02;41:03;"Great album."
41:03;41:05;"Famous Zombies album."
41:05;41:07;"I think this is it, Friends of Mine."
41:07;41:08;"Oh, yeah."
41:08;41:10;"♫♫♫"
41:10;41:13;"♫ When you get all in a crowd ♫"
41:13;41:15;"♫ And you catch her eye ♫"
41:15;41:17;"♫ And then you both smile ♫"
41:17;41:19;"♫ I feel safe inside ♫"
41:19;41:21;"Very straightforward."
41:21;41:23;"♫ She talks about you ♫"
41:23;41:25;"♫ The things that you say ♫"
41:25;41:27;"♫ The things that you do ♫"
41:27;41:31;"♫ It feels so good to know two people ♫"
41:31;41:34;"♫ So in love, so in love ♫"
41:34;41:37;"♫ Friends of mine ♫"
41:37;41:40;"Oh, yeah, and they're just listing the friends."
41:40;41:42;"Just listing couples."
41:42;41:48;"♫♫♫"
41:48;41:50;"All one-syllable names."
41:50;41:52;"Those backup vocals are amazing."
41:52;41:55;"♫ It's up to the sea ♫"
41:55;41:57;"♫ Jake and Han ♫"
41:57;42:00;"Yeah, they'd shorten it to Jake and Han."
42:00;42:02;"Dave and T."
42:02;42:04;"I think there's some double ones."
42:04;42:08;"♫ It feels so good to know two people ♫"
42:08;42:12;"♫ So in love, so in love ♫"
42:12;42:16;"♫ Chris and Terry, Paul and Molly ♫"
42:16;42:18;"Paul and Molly."
42:18;42:23;"♫ Kim and Kanye, Pete and Ariana ♫"
42:23;42:29;"♫ Jim and Chris, Don and Melania ♫"
42:29;42:31;"[laughs]"
42:31;42:34;"♫♫♫"
42:34;42:37;"Also, just, like, tearing into a guitar solo"
42:37;42:40;"about how much other people love each other,"
42:40;42:42;"it's just not a common sentiment."
42:42;42:46;"♫ It feels so good to know two people ♫"
42:46;42:50;"♫ So in love, so in love ♫"
42:50;42:54;"♫ Chris and Terry, Paul and Molly ♫"

43:12;43:15;"With other celebrity couples."
43:15;43:18;"♫ Kim and Dolly, June and Jim ♫"
43:18;43:21;"♫ And Kim and Christy ♫"
43:21;43:23;"What an ending."
43:23;43:25;"♫ Jim and Christy ♫"
43:25;43:27;"Ah."
43:27;43:29;"I especially love-- I haven't heard that song in a long time."
43:29;43:30;"That sounded amazing."
43:30;43:32;"I also love that the song gets so pumped up."
43:32;43:33;"It's kind of a barn burner."
43:33;43:34;"It really is."
43:34;43:36;"It'd be like one thing to sit down at a piano,"
43:36;43:38;"write a pretty ballad about witnessing the love of my friends."
43:38;43:39;"Right, right."
43:39;43:40;"Makes me think about--"
43:40;43:43;"Also, I love that there's almost nothing that ties it back to the speaker."
43:43;43:46;"All it says is, ""It feels good to know two people so in love."""
43:46;43:48;"And also, I just love that it's, like, energetic."
43:48;43:49;"Yeah."
43:49;43:51;"♫ It feels so good ♫"
43:51;43:54;"♫ So in love ♫"
43:54;43:56;"♫ They are friends of mine ♫"
43:56;44:00;"Just imagine a pop song anywhere near, like, the--"
44:00;44:02;"I mean, I don't think this was a big song, but--"
44:02;44:04;"The deep cut on the record."
44:04;44:05;"It's a deep cut."
44:05;44:06;"The Zombies were a big band at the time."
44:06;44:10;"Just imagine somebody--like, a big hit song that's just about other people and love."
44:10;44:11;"It just doesn't exist."
44:11;44:14;"Everything's kind of about--we're the me generation."
44:14;44:15;"Wow, man."
44:15;44:17;"Maybe that's a problem with our society, man."
44:17;44:21;"There's not enough emphasis on other people's love."
44:21;44:24;"In fact, we live in very bitter times, man."
44:24;44:27;"You see other people in love, these days you're more likely to be [bleep] them."
44:27;44:31;"I want you to go full Jim Morrison on your press tour when your album comes out."
44:31;44:32;"I don't even know what I mean by that."
44:32;44:33;"Right."
44:33;44:34;"Well, one thing I definitely learned from him--"
44:34;44:36;"Does it take really long?"
44:36;44:37;"No, I've always thought about that."
44:37;44:42;"I have this issue generally where if I don't feel totally comfortable--"
44:42;44:44;"I mean, this is totally not unique to me."
44:44;44:45;"I think a lot of people are like this."
44:45;44:48;"If I don't feel totally comfortable, I'll just, like, fill in all the space, right?"
44:48;44:49;"A lot of people are like that."
44:49;44:50;"Oh, sure."
44:50;44:53;"You're having, like, a weird conversation with somebody and they seem kind of weird."
44:53;44:54;"You'll just, like, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."
44:54;44:55;"Yeah."
44:55;45:01;"And it's very easy to do that with interviewers because partially that's what they want you to do."
45:01;45:02;"Yeah, they're banking on it."
45:02;45:05;"They'd rather let you run your mouth until you say something kind of--"
45:05;45:08;"I don't even want to say juicy because it's not like every interviewer is out to get you,"
45:08;45:12;"but they are incentivized to at least get, like, good nuggets."
45:12;45:13;"Sure."
45:13;45:14;"And a lot of their questions are kind of vague."
45:14;45:16;"So if they're like, ""What's your approach to songwriting?"""
45:16;45:20;"And if everything you say is kind of like, ""Well, you know, when I think about song--"""
45:20;45:24;"They want that little nugget where you're just like, ""Chainsmokers suck."
45:24;45:25;"That's what I think about."""
45:25;45:27;"You know, they're waiting for you to get to that point."
45:27;45:32;"And I also feel like because I often will add all these, like, little sentence fragments"
45:32;45:34;"to really try to make my point because in real time I'll be like,"
45:34;45:37;"""But having said that, I do understand where they're coming from and blah, blah, blah."""
45:37;45:39;"I just end up with these, like, crazy run-on sentences."
45:39;45:41;"So maybe one thing I can learn from this is the pause."
45:41;45:45;"Just every time somebody asks me anything--"
45:45;45:46;"Do, like, the big inhale."
45:46;45:47;"Yeah."
45:47;45:49;"""So you took five years to make this album."
45:49;45:53;"What have you been up to?"""
45:53;45:59;"You know, that's something that really bothers me, this idea that five years is a long time"
45:59;46:01;"and that I would have been doing things."
46:01;46:05;"What's wrong with doing nothing for five years?"
46:05;46:06;"I didn't say there's anything wrong."
46:06;46:09;"Our society has preoccupation with productivity."
46:09;46:12;"Why is it--this actually could be good."
46:12;46:18;"Why is it so onerous to not produce content for the capitalist enterprise?"
46:18;46:22;"When I was doing little to nothing, I felt like a tank."

46:28;46:29;"I don't know. I forgot what I was saying."
46:29;46:30;"Just say it."
46:30;46:33;"Just always pause."
46:33;46:35;"What were the influences on this album?"
46:35;46:36;"Just, like, the most part--"
46:36;46:42;"What were you listening to when you made this album?"
46:42;46:50;"That's something that really bothers me, the idea that you need to listen to music to make music."
46:50;46:52;"What's wrong with not listening to music?"
46:52;46:53;"We'll see."
46:54;46:58;"Riders on the storm"
47:02;47:07;"Into this house we're born"
47:07;47:11;"Into this world we're thrown"
47:11;47:14;"Like a dog without a bone"
47:14;47:17;"An actor out of love"
47:17;47:21;"Riders on the storm"
47:21;47:25;"There's a killer on the road"

47:39;47:42;"If you give this man a ride"
47:42;47:45;"Sweet family will die"
47:45;47:48;"Killer on the road"
47:51;47:56;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
47:56;47:59;"Should we talk about this Paul McCartney album?"
47:59;48:01;"So in love."
48:01;48:02;"'Cause I've been interested in this."
48:02;48:03;"Yeah, we should."
48:03;48:06;"First of all, I gotta say, I'm a Paul McCartney fan."
48:06;48:07;"Who the hell isn't?"
48:07;48:09;"I gotta say, though, is Jake--"
48:09;48:10;"Yeah."
48:10;48:12;"Did you check out the whole album?"
48:12;48:13;"No."
48:13;48:16;"'Cause you texted me that you had a very bad reaction to one of the singles."
48:16;48:19;"I heard the single on-- I don't know what it was."
48:19;48:22;"Oh, it might have been on Beatles radio."
48:22;48:25;"And there was a new Paul McCartney song called ""Fuh You."""
48:25;48:29;"Well, first of all, I love Paul McCartney's press tour that he's been doing."
48:29;48:32;"He's been kind of just speaking his mind."
48:32;48:33;"He--"
48:33;48:34;"Oh my God."
48:34;48:35;"He kind of broke the internet for a second."
48:35;48:36;"Yep."
48:36;48:38;"This is classic three weeks too late Time Crisis."
48:38;48:39;"Oh yeah."
48:39;48:42;"He broke the internet for a second telling a story"
48:42;48:45;"about how when he and John Lennon were lads"
48:45;48:48;"they and a group of boys masturbated together."
48:48;48:49;"Not unheard of."
48:49;48:50;"I never did that."
48:50;48:52;"And I was never even near it."
48:52;48:54;"But that's the type of thing that when I was a lad--"
48:54;48:55;"Oh yeah."
48:55;48:58;"--in Liverpool, you didn't tend to come across this type of activity,"
48:58;49:03;"but you would hear so much dumb discussion about these sex moves that don't exist."
49:03;49:04;"Yep."
49:04;49:06;"I feel like that probably happened also way more back in their day."
49:06;49:07;"Less to do."
49:07;49:10;"Yeah, there was less to do in the-- I guess even in the '50s."
49:10;49:12;"Yeah, for-- late '50s."
49:12;49:15;"Well, so anyway, Paul McCartney told this story and people were--"
49:15;49:19;"I could tell from what I read the way he told it was telling it was like,"
49:19;49:22;"""Oh, it's just funny, like a bunch of kids exploring their sexuality."""
49:22;49:26;"And he said one of the funny things about it is that people would call out"
49:26;49:28;"the names of famous actresses."
49:28;49:29;"Right."
49:29;49:30;"Oh, Brigitte Bardot."
49:30;49:31;"Brigitte Bardot."
49:31;49:33;"And then John, being a cut-up, would call out Winston Churchill."
49:33;49:35;"John with that ironic sense of humor."
49:35;49:38;"And also, John, why couldn't-- what if somebody within the crew"
49:38;49:40;"found Winston Churchill attractive?"
49:40;49:42;"You're no Jim Morrison, John Lennon."
49:42;49:43;"Yeah, you know what, John?"
49:43;49:45;"He steered us through our darkest hour."
49:45;49:47;"If that's not sexually attractive, I don't know what is."
49:47;49:51;"Anyway, the point is that Paul told this story and everybody got obsessed with it"
49:51;49:54;"to the point that the next day after the story broke,"
49:54;49:57;"the New York Post dropped one of their best covers of all time,"
49:57;49:59;"which was ""Beat the Beatles."""
49:59;50:02;"And I'm sure everybody's familiar that the New York Post famously does"
50:02;50:05;"punny wordplay headlines on their front cover."
50:05;50:09;"And the Beatles' first album in America, at least, was called ""Meet the Beatles."""
50:09;50:11;"So that's an iconic phrase associated with the Beatles."
50:11;50:14;"So anyway, it's cool. Paul's out there doing his thing."
50:14;50:16;"But Jake, and from what I've seen--"
50:16;50:18;"Paul said that tucked away for 55 years."
50:18;50:21;"Apparently he'd told the story before, just pre-internet era,"
50:21;50:23;"so it hadn't gotten picked up on in the same way."
50:23;50:29;"So I've been happy to see that Paul recently got his first number one since 1982,"
50:29;50:30;"his first number one album."
50:30;50:31;"That's amazing."
50:31;50:33;"So, you know, well-deserved."
50:33;50:35;"And it's cool he's out there speaking his mind,"
50:35;50:37;"showing people another side of Paul McCartney."
50:37;50:39;"From what I've seen, the reviews have been great."
50:39;50:40;"I haven't heard the record yet, but--"
50:40;50:41;"""Egypt Station."""
50:41;50:42;"The album's called ""Egypt Station."""
50:42;50:43;"Intriguing title."
50:43;50:44;"It's definitely."
50:44;50:48;"But before I saw that this record was getting really positive attention,"
50:48;50:51;"I was a little nervous because Jake hit me up saying,"
50:51;50:54;"""I heard this new Paul song, 'Fuck You,' and I don't like it."""
50:54;50:56;"I think it was through the Time Crisis text thread."
50:56;50:58;"You're like, ""Guys, this is rough stuff."""
50:58;50:59;"Yep. Very rough."
50:59;51:02;"So let's see if Jake is being a little too harsh."
51:18;51:22;"It can be jarring at first to hear Paul with this kind of production."
51:22;51:24;"But now I'm getting used to it."
51:53;51:54;"Fuck."
52:08;52:11;"What don't you like about it, Jake?"
52:11;52:13;"I don't like the production."
52:13;52:17;"You don't like hearing a man that age express his sexuality? Why?"
52:17;52:18;"I don't mind that."
52:18;52:20;"You know what, Jake? That really bothers me."
52:20;52:26;"I don't mind him expressing his sexuality per se."
52:26;52:30;"What I don't like, he's just kind of adopting, not only sonically,"
52:30;52:35;"but lyrically, the language of music that has nothing to do with him."
52:35;52:37;"He's talking about going to a club?"
52:37;52:38;"He didn't say club, did he?"
52:38;52:41;"Towards the beginning of the song? Something. He was out."
52:41;52:43;"He was out on the town meeting some--"
52:43;52:45;"Okay. I'm sure he does that."
52:45;52:46;"Is he single right now?"
52:46;52:47;"Honestly, I want--"
52:47;52:50;"The guy's in his 70s. He's a giant of songwriting."
52:50;52:56;"I want a little more wisdom, pathos, introspection, observation,"
52:56;52:59;"some hint of wisdom or something from him."
52:59;53:02;"The opening lyrics are ""Come on baby now, let me look at you,"
53:02;53:04;"talking about yourself, try to tell the truth."
53:04;53:07;"I can stay up half the night trying to crack your code."
53:07;53:09;"I can stay up half the night, but I'd rather hit the road."
53:09;53:11;"On the night that I met you, I was on the town."
53:11;53:14;"On the night that I met you, I just want to know how you feel."
53:14;53:16;"I want to love the soul, proud and real."
53:16;53:18;"You make me want to go out and steal."
53:18;53:20;"I just want to fuck you. I just want to fuck you."
53:20;53:22;"It's rough stuff, folks."
53:22;53:24;"I mean, he's kind of like, ""Let's cut to the chase."""
53:24;53:25;"Yeah."
53:25;53:28;"I wonder how you feel about the song if you like the production more."
53:28;53:30;"If this was like an unreleased Paul from the '80s,"
53:30;53:32;"just like him on the guitar."
53:32;53:34;"I could stay up half the night trying to crack your code."
53:34;53:35;"It's not a good song."
53:35;53:37;"I mean, the melodies are memorable."
53:37;53:40;"Do you remember that CeeLo song, ""Fuck You,"""
53:40;53:42;"and they had to change it to ""Forget You""?"
53:42;53:45;"Yeah, you know, that's led me to say ""forget you"" a lot in my life."
53:45;53:49;"If I'm kind of like play acting that I'm like mad about something,"
53:49;53:52;"I'll just always be like, ""Forget you,"""
53:52;53:55;"which is something that people say."
53:55;53:57;"No, it's something that people say,"
53:57;54:01;"but that song kind of like reentered it into my vocabulary."
54:01;54:02;"""Forget you."""
54:02;54:04;"It's wholesome."
54:04;54:07;"The song just strikes me as sad and kind of pandering."
54:07;54:11;"'Cause I get he's like, ""Look, I'm an old man."
54:11;54:13;"People expect me to write these old man songs."
54:13;54:15;"I don't want to do that."
54:15;54:17;"I want to like switch it up and surprise people."""
54:17;54:19;"But then it's sort of like, ""That's your solution?"""

01:00:04;01:00:06;"♪ Living in the world of greed ♪"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Yeah, and then the lyrics become--"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Yeah, it's--"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"The lyrics become much more moving in that context."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"Anyway, Ken Burns, Vietnam doc, check it out."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Should we do the top five?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"It's time for the top five."
01:00:19;01:00:23;"F-F-F-F-F-Five on iTunes."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"So this week on the top five,"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"we're gonna compare the greatest hits of this week in 2018"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1982."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"Why 1982?"
01:00:33;01:00:37;"Paul McCartney's ""Egypt Station"" is his first number one record."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"Since?"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"1982's ""Tug of War."""
01:00:40;01:00:41;"Yep."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"Which was also a number one record."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"And this is considered the longest--"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"or it is the longest gap between number ones"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"for a living artist ever--"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"36 years, 3 months, and 10 days."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"Shout-out to Paul, still doing his thing."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Mm-hmm."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"So I'm gonna take it back to '82."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"All right."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"I wasn't alive."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"You were, Jake."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"The days between."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"The days-- [laughs]"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"1977 to 1984 are truly the days between."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"In the TC-verse."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"What was going on in '82 with you?"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Let's see, I would've been 5,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"holding it down pretty solid in Southbury."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Is that the year Dave was born?"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"He's born in December of '81."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"So this was kind of your first full year"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"with the little brother."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Yeah, he would've been--"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"what are we in here, September?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yeah, so he would've been almost a year at this point."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Do you have memories of Dave being born?"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Yeah."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I remember the anticipation."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"I remember not knowing"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"whether it would be a brother or a sister."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Oh, 'cause your parents didn't know?"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"I guess they didn't know."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"Whoa."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"I don't know if that was by choice"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"or if in '81 that wasn't as much a thing."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"You know, recently I watched a bunch of YouTube videos"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"'cause I've been seeing so many gender reveal videos."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Are you familiar with this concept?"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Not really, but I think I picked up on it."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"People being like,"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"finding out what the gender of their baby's gonna be."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Yeah, and it kind of started--"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"maybe people have been doing this forever,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"but now similar to promposals."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Do you know what promposals are?"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"No, but again, I'm making the logical jump."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Like, these are YouTube videos you're talking about."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Yeah."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"And they're just like, ""Hey, gang."""
01:02:11;01:02:12;"Or Instagram."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"But it's just like,"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"people kind of started upping the ante with certain things"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"when they knew that it could go viral."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"So if back in the day a gender reveal"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"might just be somebody making a cake,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"and generally speaking with gender reveals,"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"they kind of adhere to a very strict gender color scheme,"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"which is blue for boys and pink for girls,"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"which, you know, I thought we were getting rid of in 2018,"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"but perhaps not."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"But are you literally seeing the moment when they find out?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Like, the split second?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Yes, well, probably for one of the parents."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"It seems like it's very centered around the dad finding out,"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"from what I've seen."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Dad's checked out, man."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Yeah, dad's checked out."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Mom knows."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Yeah, I guess the dad didn't even go with her"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"to the OB-GYN appointment."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"But I've seen ones, like, let's say that the dad"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"is a professional baseball player."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Well, how about this?"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"We gather the friends and family around the backyard,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"we'll pitch the dad a ball,"
01:03:03;01:03:07;"and when he smacks into it, dust will fly out"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"that's either blue or pink,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"revealing the gender in a way that speaks"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"to the dad's profession, baseball."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"Wow, that is elaborate."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"So there's kind of everything you could think of."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"Right."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"So, like, you could go down to Rabbit Hole"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"and just watch, like, best gender reveals"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"and just watch, take down, like, 200 of them."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"Are there any Grateful Dead-themed gender reveals?"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"What would that one even be?"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"You, like, close your eyes and they, like,"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"play a Grateful Dead song and either it's--"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"If it's from '72, it's a boy."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"If it's from '77, it's a girl."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"If it's Jack Straw, it's a boy."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"If it's Ramblin' Rose--"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Yeah, if it's Stella Blue--"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"Yeah."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Oh, that's confusing."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"If it's Stella Blue--"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"Oh, right."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"How about this?"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"If it's from the era where Donna performed with them,"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"it's a girl."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Nice."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"If it's from before or after, it's a boy."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Yep."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"So you might have to take down a solid 30-minute--"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"Without knowing."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Yeah."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"We're gonna start you at minute 15"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"of the 45-minute playing in the band."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Or if you're, like, a true Deadhead, you'd be like,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"""Easy, that's '73. Donna was a member."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"It's a girl. Nice."""
01:04:13;01:04:14;"But whatever, this is--"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Nice."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"This is a thing people do."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Gotcha."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"You know what?"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Like, maybe if I was planning a gender-reveal party for you,"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"Jake, 'cause you're a painter,"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"I might gather your friends and family in your art studio."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I would get a blank canvas."
01:04:29;01:04:35;"We'd blindfold you, dip your paintbrush in the paint,"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"put on some good tunes for you, and say,"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"""Jake, I want to take you two minutes,"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"and just follow your instinct as you paint blindfolded."""
01:04:42;01:04:45;"And then we would say, ""All right, man, take it off."""
01:04:45;01:04:46;"And you would open your eyes to see"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"an impressionistic pink painting."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"If it's a girl, blue if it's a boy."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"That sounds really cool."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"We should do that."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"I love that."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Very moving."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Whether or not you have a kid, we should do that."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"Very moving."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Why was I talking about this?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Because we're talking about the top--"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Oh, no, we're talking about when you found out that--"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"You didn't know if you were going to have a brother."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"Right."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"So then there's an adjacent category,"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"or an interrelated category to gender reveals,"
01:05:11;01:05:15;"which is, like, just people videoing their kids"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"to give the kid a gender reveal."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"So this is not, like--"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Oh, wow. Let them know."
01:05:19;01:05:20;"This is not daddy gender reveal."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"So I watched one, which the parents deemed"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"to share with the world,"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"where they go up to their little daughter"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"who looks like four or five, and they say,"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"""Hey, here's a little gift."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Remember, you know how Mommy said"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"you were going to have a brother or sister, right?"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"Coming up soon? Yes?"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"Well, here's a little gift."""
01:05:37;01:05:39;"And then they give her blue balloons"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"and a little pouch with some blue sweets."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"And the girl bursts into tears."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And she's like, ""No."""
01:05:45;01:05:46;"And they're like, ""Why?"""
01:05:46;01:05:48;"And she's like, ""I wanted a sister."""
01:05:48;01:05:50;"""But you're getting a little brother."""
01:05:50;01:05:52;"""But I don't want a brother."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"I wanted a sister."""
01:05:54;01:05:56;"I remember having that exact same--"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"That you wanted a sister?"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"No, a brother."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Oh, so you were psyched."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"I was relieved when the phone rang"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"at my grandmother's house."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"You were just like--"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"And I was just like--"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Talk."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"[laughs]"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"What did we get?"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Give it to me straight."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"""Did I get a brother? Yes. Yes."""
01:06:12;01:06:15;"I went down on one knee and just fist-pumped."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"I have no memories of when I found out"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"that I was getting a little sister."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"See, that's the thing."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"I think you have slightly more memories at five"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"than you do at four."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"And when you're closer to my sister."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Right."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"So you don't remember any of the anticipation"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"around the house or anything?"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"No, I vaguely remember--"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Like, ""Mom's pregnant."""
01:06:29;01:06:31;"I don't remember Mom being pregnant."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"I remember--"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I have some vague memory of being like,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"""I'm at Grandma's house for two days"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"because my mom's in the hospital."""
01:06:38;01:06:40;"I remember that there was--"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"This is some old-school shit."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Maybe it's still true."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"My sister was born at a hospital in New Jersey,"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"and I remember that hospital had a McDonald's."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"So I remember being, like,"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"some vague sense of just being like, ""Yes!"""
01:06:51;01:06:52;"All right, where are we?"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"We were going to count down the top five"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"gender reveals of 2018."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"That was my situation circa '82."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"That's the year I was born."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Oh!"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Oh, you were born '82?"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"Yeah."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Just FYI."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Just throwing it out there."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"The year that Seinfeld came into this world."
01:07:08;01:07:11;"Okay, so the number five song in '82"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"was ""Melissa Manchester."""
01:07:13;01:07:15;"""You should hear how she talks about you."""

01:23:00;01:23:03;"because people gave him so much s---, which wasn't fair"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"because he's an incredible songwriter."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"But you could imagine people making fun of some of his power ballads"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"and just be like, ""Really? You're giving me so much s---?"
01:23:11;01:23:14;"Have you heard that Peter Cetera era Chicago?"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"You hear that David Foster era Chicago?"

01:23:45;01:23:47;"I met Machine Gun Kelly once."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Is he a badass?"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"Well, it was a pretty surreal scenario."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"We didn't really chop it up or anything,"

01:24:14;01:24:16;"I certainly knew when I got on the plane,"
