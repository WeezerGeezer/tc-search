00:00;00:04;"Hey everybody, Time Crisis in a time of crisis."
00:04;00:06;"We're back."
00:06;00:08;"We're not going to do the ABBA this week."
00:08;00:09;"We wanted to come back."
00:09;00:10;"We want to do an episode."
00:10;00:13;"We want to talk to each other and talk to other people."
00:13;00:15;"Obviously this is a very serious moment."
00:15;00:20;"So we wanted to come back with an episode, but make sure we got to talk about what's"
00:20;00:24;"going on and really think through some of the issues of the day."
00:24;00:25;"It's going to be an interesting episode."
00:25;00:30;"We got some interesting guests and of course some friends of the show."
00:30;00:31;"So here we go."
00:31;00:32;"Check it out."
00:32;00:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:36;00:40;"We should address that we did record a show for last week."
00:40;00:44;"It was a very good show and I think we'll probably drop it this coming week, but we"
00:44;00:52;"wanted to do a slightly more real time one first because we recorded that show just before"
00:52;00:58;"the big protests began and suddenly it felt like a totally different moment that should"
00:58;01:02;"not be impeded in any way by our discussion of the Chunky Dunkies."
01:02;01:04;"But it was a decent episode."
01:04;01:07;"Just dropping it that Sunday did not feel right."
01:07;01:14;"Yeah, we were talking about doors, cover bands, and it was very frivolous, very TC."
01:14;01:18;"The only thing I'll say is that we were weirdly ahead of the curve with the Chunky Dunkies."
01:18;01:20;"That's why we were talking about them again."
01:20;01:24;"You'll hear in that next episode, that'll be a on demand episode."
01:24;01:28;"You'll hear about the extent to which the Chunky Dunkies really blew up."
01:28;01:31;"But anyway, we've got some good guests today."
01:31;01:36;"First we're going to have Alex S. Vitale, who wrote this book, The End of Policing."
01:36;01:39;"So he'll be very interesting to talk to."
01:39;01:44;"And then we also have a friend of the show, Kid Mero and Winter, who's back on the road"
01:44;01:45;"starbucking again."
01:45;01:50;"So three different takes on the state of America today."
01:50;01:52;"What's your vibe been the past week, Jake?"
01:52;01:53;"You were taking it to the streets, right?"
01:53;01:58;"Yeah, I went on Tuesday downtown to City Hall."
01:58;02:00;"There was a big march there."
02:00;02:01;"Did you make a sign?"
02:01;02:02;"It was great."
02:02;02:03;"Didn't show up with a sign."
02:03;02:04;"Interesting."
02:04;02:08;"You have all the skills to make a great sign in American history."
02:08;02:09;"That's true."
02:09;02:13;"Well, I just thought I would just kind of show up and just kind of be one among the"
02:13;02:15;"masses walking along."
02:15;02:16;"I planned it a little more."
02:16;02:17;"I could have done something."
02:17;02:22;"I really like your painting of a staples in front of that mountain."
02:22;02:24;"I think I understand how that relates to the protest."
02:24;02:25;"I'm not entirely sure."
02:25;02:26;"Right."
02:26;02:27;"Just holding up a canvas."
02:27;02:29;"Just a painting that you..."
02:29;02:35;"I mean, there's a pretty cute picture that always circulates during protest times of"
02:35;02:40;"a little kid holding up a piece of cardboard where they did a little child's kind of abstract"
02:40;02:41;"expressionist scribble."
02:41;02:43;"He's holding it up."
02:43;02:47;"And there is something kind of like sweet about that where it's like, you know what?"
02:47;02:49;"Maybe there is some meaning in abstraction."
02:49;02:50;"I could see that."
02:50;02:53;"I could see if you were like, if you just were holding a sign with like a drawing of"
02:53;02:55;"like some daisies or something."
02:55;02:56;"Yeah."
02:56;03:02;"We were shown by a few people, somebody holding what appeared to be a painter's canvas, except"
03:02;03:05;"I don't know if it was on the front, but what we can see from the back said, what was it?"
03:05;03:07;"Fish heads for black lives?"
03:07;03:08;"I think so."
03:08;03:09;"Yeah."
03:09;03:11;"Fish fans for BLM or something like that."
03:11;03:12;"All right."
03:12;03:13;"Let's send that to the fish community."
03:13;03:15;"I mean, we've wondered this before."
03:15;03:21;"Like we've talked about the fact that there are some like shockingly, like very high profile"
03:21;03:24;"right wing fans of the Grateful Dead."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:26;"Like Ann Coulter."
03:26;03:27;"Yeah."
03:27;03:28;"Which seems so bizarre."
03:28;03:33;"I mean, I noticed when I was checking out Twitter last week, when there were protests"
03:33;03:39;"in Nashville, there were some rumors that the Ryman Theater was getting defaced or looted"
03:39;03:40;"or something."
03:40;03:42;"And I know that Ryman Theater is a beloved venue."
03:42;03:46;"Vampire Weekends played there a few times and know it well."
03:46;03:50;"And I don't think in the end anything really happened there, but it was just like that"
03:50;03:53;"type of like rumor that flies around to get people worked up."
03:53;03:55;"Be like, are you kidding me?"
03:55;03:57;"How does messing up the rhyme and help anything?"
03:57;03:58;"Oh my God."
03:58;04:01;"You know, and I did see this one person who was like, I just was like scrolling through"
04:01;04:06;"comments, which I try not to do too much because it truly destroys your brain."
04:06;04:11;"But I saw this one image, somebody had like a steely for their image and they were just"
04:11;04:13;"like, oh, hell no."
04:13;04:15;"If anybody f***s up the Ryman Theater, it's on."
04:15;04:20;"And I was just like, is this truly just like a Nashville based deadhead who's just like"
04:20;04:22;"anti protester?"
04:22;04:25;"Or maybe they're just like such a big deadhead."
04:25;04:27;"They're just like such a fan of live music that they're just like, guys, burn down a"
04:27;04:31;"police station, but do not mess with live music venues."
04:31;04:34;"But there's something like weird about seeing like the still your face with this kind of"
04:34;04:37;"like, what the f*** are these protesters doing kind of moment."
04:37;04:40;"There's going to be a big age range within the dead community."
04:40;04:45;"So you're going to get maybe some older folks not down with the civil unrest."
04:45;04:51;"I would love to see if the Phish fan community lean slightly to the left of the dead community."
04:51;04:56;"I mean, you just imagine they're slightly younger just because it's a generational thing."
04:56;05:02;"You'd imagine it'd be like slightly like you can picture that dude who is huge deadhead"
05:02;05:07;"in his 20s and 30s like original deadhead doing acid and stuff."
05:07;05:12;"And now he's got the kind of like, I don't know, like wearing Oakley's and kind of like"
05:12;05:13;"angry."
05:13;05:15;"And this is one thought that I've had recently."
05:15;05:19;"I mean, well, I guess we should say first of all, anybody's listen to Time Crisis when"
05:19;05:21;"we talk about serious stuff."
05:21;05:25;"I think you won't be surprised to know that people like me and Jake are obviously in support"
05:25;05:28;"of the protesters and find Black Lives Matter."
05:28;05:32;"Obviously, we're not into any of that all lives matter garbage, which is I've never"
05:32;05:36;"seen a single person say that and like truly mean it anyway."
05:36;05:40;"And I think obviously these examples of police brutality, the reason people are in the streets"
05:40;05:42;"is because they're so cut and dry."
05:42;05:45;"Nobody would accept that happening to somebody that they knew."
05:45;05:47;"And you shouldn't accept that happening to a stranger."
05:47;05:51;"But I mean, it's been making me think so much as I'm sure everybody has about just like"
05:51;05:54;"cops in general, the concept of cops."
05:54;05:59;"And when I think about like the aging deadhead who maybe somehow became like kind of right"
05:59;06:06;"wing, it does seem like there used to be some kind of like broader anti-cop consensus."
06:06;06:12;"Maybe it's happening again, but there used to be like that kind of like not necessarily"
06:12;06:18;"like sweet natured, social justice oriented person, but almost that like libertarian rock"
06:18;06:20;"and roller just like man, f*** the cops."
06:20;06:21;"You know what I mean?"
06:21;06:24;"Because like when you think about the Grateful Dead, and I'm definitely we're not going to"
06:24;06:28;"talk about this too long because I don't want people to think that we're using this current"
06:28;06:31;"terrible moment as a reason to talk about the dead more."
06:31;06:33;"But you know, they represent a generational thing, right?"
06:33;06:38;"And when you think about how many times there were these like negative interactions between"
06:38;06:43;"like kids at Grateful Dead shows and cops, because there was this feeling of kind of"
06:43;06:45;"like authority is messed up."
06:45;06:49;"A certain type of authority, especially when it's weaponized, is messed up."
06:49;06:54;"And even if you're not like super tuned in with social justice movements, I feel like"
06:54;06:59;"there used to be a tiny bit more consensus, or maybe there always is a consensus with"
06:59;07:00;"young people."
07:00;07:05;"And then as white people get older, they tend to veer right and that's the problem."
07:05;07:11;"But I feel like there used to be some consensus where a lot of people understood that there's"
07:11;07:15;"a problem with police brutality."
07:15;07:19;"And maybe that's the issue is that it always goes, people got really short memories."
07:19;07:22;"Yeah, I mean, it's not affecting you or your community."
07:22;07:24;"It's kind of like, well, they did what they had to do."
07:24;07:29;"Yeah, I mean, I guess that's, you know, maybe where the hippies and the punks used to dovetail."
07:29;07:30;"Right."
07:30;07:31;"But that was a long time ago."
07:31;07:35;"And now, you know, there aren't many hippies or punks anymore."
07:35;07:36;"Right."
07:36;07:40;"And then for several years after 9/11, there was the sort of like, deference paid to law"
07:40;07:42;"enforcement."
07:42;07:46;"And yeah, it was just we're in a different era than the hippies and the punks."
07:46;07:51;"That's a sad part of human nature a little bit is like, I can totally picture this person."
07:51;07:55;"They were either a hippie in the 60s or a punk in the 70s or 80s."
07:55;07:58;"They were maybe a middle class white kid."
07:58;08:00;"They just wanted to have fun and be with their friends."
08:00;08:02;"And they would have a very negative interaction with a cop."
08:02;08:08;"And they would see the way in which when somebody has a weapon and is charged with enforcing"
08:08;08:13;"control, that that can create really negative situations for people."
08:13;08:14;"And they got it."
08:14;08:19;"And then it's like the early 90s, maybe like a small business owner has a mortgage or something"
08:19;08:24;"starting to feel a little more like protective of like law and order and property."
08:24;08:29;"And then like iced tea with body count cop killer comes out and is just like, this is"
08:29;08:31;"a bridge too far."
08:31;08:33;"This is just wanton violence, anger."
08:33;08:35;"It's kind of that's classic."
08:35;08:42;"Fragile coalition falls apart."
08:43;08:47;"The sun is getting higher."
08:47;08:53;"I can't help you if you're a problem."
08:53;08:59;"If you won't help me with mine."
08:59;09:03;"Gotta get down."
09:03;09:05;"Gotta get down."
09:05;09:11;"To the mine."
09:12;09:14;"Oh, my."
09:14;09:19;"You know, I did see an All Lives Matter sign during my march."
09:19;09:24;"Huge crowd, you know, going through the street and walking past one of those like new, like"
09:24;09:27;"kind of like 12 story new condos downtown."
09:27;09:28;"Yeah."
09:28;09:33;"There were some people out on the balcony, like the glass balcony with an All Lives Matter"
09:33;09:35;"sign taped to their balcony."
09:35;09:40;"And then also a sign that said businesses did not kill George Floyd."
09:40;09:44;"And they were standing out in the balcony, kind of like holding drinks, sort of like"
09:44;09:47;"12 stories up, kind of looking down at the crowd being like, what?"
09:47;09:48;"What?"
09:48;09:53;"I don't necessarily agree with it, but of course, there's a case to be made that aspects"
09:53;09:56;"of looting are counterproductive."
09:56;10:01;"I don't personally feel like making that point, especially because what we've seen so far"
10:01;10:07;"hasn't been like truly out of control in the sense that it's like, you know, when you look"
10:07;10:11;"at riots of the past where blocks get burned down and you're just like, that's going to"
10:11;10:14;"take a generation to like recover for this community."
10:14;10:19;"And of course, there's still so much like speculation about with huge groups of people."
10:19;10:23;"You can literally have five people, whatever their political agenda is."
10:23;10:26;"All it would take is five people to make a peaceful protest seem violent."
10:26;10:29;"You know, five people with bricks or a shovel."
10:29;10:30;"It doesn't take much."
10:30;10:33;"One person could start it."
10:33;10:37;"I was thinking that when we're on our march, because the march was totally peaceful."
10:37;10:38;"Vibes were good."
10:38;10:40;"Cops and National Guard were keeping their distance."
10:40;10:45;"But I was like, man, it would just take one person, even throwing like a water bottle."
10:45;10:52;"And so no wonder that the concept of the agent provocateur has existed for a long time, because"
10:52;10:56;"it's really so easy for somebody to embed themselves in something and change the tone"
10:56;10:57;"of it very quickly."
10:57;10:59;"And I'm sure everybody's seen there's videos."
10:59;11:05;"One of them looked like L.A. and there's a black woman is on camera and she's yelling"
11:05;11:07;"at these two younger women."
11:07;11:08;"I don't know."
11:08;11:09;"They could be white, Hispanic."
11:09;11:10;"They're not black."
11:10;11:14;"And they're masked up and they're spray painting BLM on a Starbucks."
11:14;11:18;"And a black woman is yelling at them saying, what are you doing?"
11:18;11:19;"Who asked you to do this?"
11:19;11:23;"We're the ones that are going to get in trouble for this, not you."
11:23;11:25;"And then these two people kind of sheepishly walk off."
11:25;11:28;"Are they undercover cops doing it?"
11:28;11:31;"Are they paid or are they just people who just wanted to get in the mix and thought"
11:31;11:32;"it was a good idea?"
11:32;11:35;"And then this woman thought it was a terrible idea."
11:35;11:40;"But of course, what the woman said is right, that this image of a Starbucks tagged up with"
11:40;11:47;"BLM will be sent out to people all over the country as an example of why the BLM movement"
11:47;11:50;"has no respect for property or something."
11:50;11:55;"Yeah, it was interesting to like when it really started to explode in Minneapolis."
11:55;11:58;"How many of the photographs were of like chain stores?"
11:58;11:59;"Yeah."
11:59;12:04;"Famously, the photo of like the AutoZone getting thrashed and that there was like a dollar"
12:04;12:05;"tree."
12:05;12:06;"And of course, the target."
12:06;12:07;"Yes."
12:07;12:08;"But I actually looked it up."
12:08;12:12;"I was like, oh, man, because like I have to say, like, it is a bummer when you see like"
12:12;12:15;"photos of like some small family restaurant burning down."
12:15;12:17;"This is sort of like, oh, man."
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:21;"I don't feel that same sense of sympathy like with an AutoZone."
12:21;12:26;"And then I was like, well, maybe there's an individual franchisee that owns an AutoZone."
12:26;12:32;"But then I actually did a little bit of number crunching and determined AutoZone and Dollar"
12:32;12:35;"Tree do not offer franchise opportunities."
12:35;12:38;"So they're just really corporate owned stores."
12:38;12:40;"I'm sure very well insured."
12:40;12:46;"I mean, it's hard to have too much sympathy for like smashed windows at a big box store,"
12:46;12:50;"especially because in this country we've seen, you know, the L.A. riots."
12:50;12:58;"This is an example of a true like conflagration that was so far more dangerous, more brutal,"
12:58;13:00;"involved like torching stuff in a community."
13:00;13:02;"You know, you've seen those images."
13:02;13:04;"Anybody's watched like a documentary about it."
13:04;13:08;"I recommend the L.A. 92, which is on Netflix, is like a really gripping one."
13:08;13:09;"No narration."
13:09;13:10;"You're kind of."
13:10;13:11;"Have you seen that one, Jake?"
13:11;13:12;"Yes, I have."
13:12;13:13;"Crazy."
13:13;13:14;"Yeah."
13:14;13:17;"So there's something about that that's I think really worth revisiting for people right now"
13:17;13:21;"is that a I don't know how it'll make somebody feel for me."
13:21;13:22;"I see it."
13:22;13:27;"And I in some ways, it reminds me that so far what's happening now, I certainly haven't"
13:27;13:32;"seen anything that seems quite as like intense as that."
13:32;13:34;"It doesn't mean there's not intensity of feeling."
13:34;13:38;"But, you know, this is to put it all in perspective that a these times we're living in are not"
13:38;13:40;"exactly unprecedented."
13:40;13:41;"Covid and Trump."
13:41;13:42;"Yeah."
13:42;13:44;"Give a different patina to the moment."
13:44;13:49;"But in a larger sense, it's not truly an unprecedented time and could either make you feel a little"
13:49;13:54;"calmer or or just more depressed that it is such a cyclical thing."
13:54;13:55;"Yeah."
13:55;14:01;"In some ways, it almost seems like these protests and even the looting seems so much more targeted."
14:01;14:03;"It doesn't seem chaotic and out of control."
14:03;14:04;"Right."
14:04;14:05;"Seems like a strategic like."
14:05;14:06;"Yeah, because I agree."
14:06;14:11;"Seeing like a mom and pop store charred somebody's livelihood up in smoke."
14:11;14:16;"That is a thorny moral issue where you're like, even if they're sympathetic to the protesters,"
14:16;14:18;"how's that person supposed to feel?"
14:18;14:20;"That's tricky, but we haven't seen a lot of that."
14:20;14:23;"So, yeah, that makes it all feel a little more under control."
14:24;14:33;"When I'm weary and so worn out."
14:33;14:45;"And my mind's clouded and filled with doubt."
14:45;14:58;"That's when I feel the most alive."
14:58;15:11;"My sarcastic kisses are how I thrive."
15:11;15:16;"So anyway, like we said, anybody listens to Time Crisis knows people like me and Jake"
15:16;15:22;"or don't find these situations to be particularly ambiguous."
15:22;15:26;"And I really do think a lot of people, it seems, and it's heartening to know how many"
15:26;15:30;"people are talking about issues of police brutality at this moment."
15:30;15:35;"I really do think that a majority of Americans see these images and these videos and are"
15:35;15:36;"disturbed by it."
15:36;15:43;"And we could go into the details on what specifically happened to somebody like George Floyd or"
15:43;15:44;"Breonna Taylor."
15:44;15:47;"And I do think people need to acquaint themselves with the details."
15:47;15:52;"But it always leads to this place where the next question is like, so what's supposed"
15:52;15:53;"to change?"
15:53;15:57;"And that's the thing that I just keep coming back to and wanting to read about, because"
15:57;16:00;"I agree people need to protest."
16:00;16:02;"People need to vote."
16:02;16:04;"All these things are important."
16:04;16:06;"I don't want to minimize them."
16:06;16:10;"But I guess this happens to a lot of people as you get older and you've been to protests."
16:10;16:15;"For me, one of the defining protests of my life was the a million people in the streets"
16:15;16:19;"of Manhattan against the war in Iraq, which unfortunately did nothing."
16:19;16:24;"It doesn't mean that I look down on those protests and I admire people who organize"
16:24;16:25;"protests and get out there."
16:25;16:26;"But I was down there."
16:26;16:30;"I was probably my first big protest as an adult."
16:30;16:35;"And there is that feeling where you're like, you see all this anger, you know, so many"
16:35;16:37;"people who feel that way."
16:37;16:42;"But there is this big question, like, do we just like live in like some weird matrix where"
16:42;16:45;"just like nobody's in control?"
16:45;16:48;"Obviously, we're aware of the racial and economic disparities in this country."
16:48;16:51;"So we know that certain groups of people are in control."
16:51;16:56;"But we also know that the Democrats have effective control of a lot of big cities where there's"
16:56;16:57;"plenty of police brutality."
16:57;17:00;"Minneapolis, for instance, I'm not a huge fan of the Democrats."
17:00;17:03;"I always vote for them over Republicans."
17:03;17:05;"But, you know, I think they need a lot of reforms themselves."
17:05;17:11;"But you see in a state where there's a liberal mayor, a Democratic governor, not a single"
17:11;17:13;"Republican on the city council."
17:13;17:17;"It is one of those things where you're like, well, if even the opposition party can't even"
17:17;17:25;"govern a city in a way that truly changes the relationship of police to poor people"
17:25;17:29;"and black people, you really have to fight to not become nihilistic."
17:29;17:30;"You know what I mean?"
17:30;17:31;"Oh, I mean, totally."
17:31;17:35;"And that's, you know, partially why I wanted to have Alex S. Vitale on."
17:35;17:37;"And we're about to get him on the phone."
17:37;17:39;"So he wrote this book, The End of Policing."
17:39;17:41;"He's a professor at Brooklyn College."
17:41;17:48;"And this book, by the way, Verso Books, well-known kind of lefty academic publisher, actually"
17:48;17:51;"put up the e-book of this for free."
17:51;17:56;"If you go to the Verso Books website, you could buy a hard copy, but you could also"
17:56;17:59;"get the e-book for free if you go to that option."
17:59;18:03;"So, you know, there's this Atlantic article he wrote floating around where he kind of"
18:03;18:09;"laid out why so many of these reforms that people are begging for, that liberals are"
18:09;18:11;"begging for, don't work."
18:11;18:14;"And so it really struck a chord with me as somebody who's, you know, I'm reaching that"
18:14;18:19;"place in life where you have to fight to not be nihilistic because you've seen protests"
18:19;18:25;"fail, and you've seen well-meaning people still somehow like put people in office who"
18:25;18:26;"don't do anything."
18:26;18:29;"And you just start to like legitimately get confused."
18:29;18:33;"I understand that, you know, half the country are Republicans."
18:33;18:35;"You know, we don't share the same values."
18:35;18:40;"What I don't understand is why the half that supposedly shares the same values is so ineffective."
18:40;18:43;"You know, you start to ask those questions, and it's not easy."
18:43;18:46;"So anyway, in his book, he kind of gets into the history of policing."
18:46;18:50;"That was interesting because it made me think, you know, on Time Crisis, we always love to"
18:50;18:53;"go deep on stuff, get into the origins."
18:53;18:59;"Like, Jake, you've always been very fascinated and knowledgeable about the origins of chain"
18:59;19:01;"restaurants, like, you know, paint the picture."
19:01;19:02;"Where was this started?"
19:02;19:04;"What did the retail landscape look like before it existed?"
19:04;19:07;"Those are all like really valuable questions to ask."
19:07;19:11;"And reading his book, I kind of realized like I don't even know the version of that when"
19:11;19:12;"it comes to cops."
19:12;19:13;"It's something that we just like assume."
19:13;19:15;"Of course, there's always been police, right?"
19:15;19:20;"And the way he kind of tells the story of how the modern police force was developed"
19:20;19:25;"makes you realize that what we have now is not just something that always exists."
19:25;19:28;"You know, you could make the case that people want to live in a society where there's some"
19:28;19:33;"sort of like safety officers or arbitrators or third parties you can go to to deal with"
19:33;19:36;"disputes between people like to live in a safe world."
19:36;19:37;"Of course."
19:37;19:41;"But what we have is a very specific thing, just like you're always going to have restaurants."
19:41;19:45;"But how did we end up with like 500 red lobsters?"
19:45;19:47;"You know, like people need to eat."
19:47;19:53;"But the American retail dining landscape ended up this way for a variety of reasons, you"
19:53;19:56;"know, and I think those are questions that we don't ask enough about policing."
19:56;20:00;"And in some ways, we're always kind of just like trying to deal with the outcome where"
20:00;20:04;"it's like, right, how do we punish that cop versus like these bigger questions?"
20:04;20:09;"So anyway, let's get Alex on the phone because he's somebody who clearly has thought about"
20:09;20:12;"this deeply, researched and wrote about it."
20:12;20:14;"And I got a lot of questions for him."
20:14;20:18;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
20:18;20:22;"Hello."
20:22;20:23;"Hey, Alex."
20:23;20:24;"Yeah."
20:24;20:25;"Hey, welcome to Time Crisis."
20:25;20:26;"Jan with Ezra and Jake."
20:26;20:28;"Hey, how's it going, guys?"
20:28;20:29;"Not bad."
20:29;20:31;"We really appreciate having you on the show."
20:31;20:34;"I just burned through your book the past few days."
20:34;20:39;"It's very cool that Verso Books put the e-book up for free and we're recommending it to our"
20:39;20:42;"listeners and got a lot of questions about the end of policing."
20:42;20:46;"I'm looking through the highlights that I made on my Kindle."
20:46;20:50;"The first one is just the phrase ""right wing martial arts expert Chuck Norris""."
20:50;20:56;"I think I might have just found that to be funny and a great description."
20:56;21:00;"Maybe your next book should be about the rise of right wing martial arts experts in America."
21:00;21:01;"Yeah."
21:01;21:02;"There are quite a few of them."
21:02;21:03;"Too many."
21:03;21:04;"Let's start with the first."
21:04;21:06;"One thing I found really interesting that I didn't expect in your book is that at the"
21:06;21:11;"beginning, before you get into examining and diagnosing a lot of the problems of modern"
21:11;21:18;"policing, you kind of give the readers a little origin story of modern policing."
21:18;21:21;"In a naive way, I realized it's the kind of thing I never thought about."
21:21;21:25;"I think a lot of people, we just assume there have always been cops."
21:25;21:29;"There's always been authority for thousands of years."
21:29;21:34;"But you kind of get into the origins of the specific type of policing that we have now"
21:34;21:36;"because it didn't always exist."
21:36;21:42;"Most kind of liberal scholars of policing, they talk about the London Metropolitan Police"
21:42;21:45;"formed in 1829 as kind of the beginning of policing."
21:45;21:50;"I argue that really the first modern police force is the Charleston City Watch and Guard,"
21:50;21:52;"which is formed in the 1790s."
21:52;21:58;"The reason liberals don't talk about it is because its primary law enforcement objective"
21:58;22:04;"was to manage a mobile slave population that worked outside the home of its owners."
22:04;22:10;"So it's a complicated and not very pretty history, and I'm happy to go into any details"
22:10;22:12;"you want to talk about."
22:12;22:13;"Well, that's interesting right there."
22:13;22:17;"So you're talking about the Charleston, South Carolina Police Force, because that's the"
22:17;22:24;"type of thing that I think a liberal person might see on social media where somebody says,"
22:24;22:29;"""Don't you understand that the modern police force is rooted in just controlling slaves?"""
22:29;22:34;"And I think a lot of people might say, ""Well, I mean, not literally."
22:34;22:41;"I understand the metaphor of groups of majority white people controlling and oppressing black people,"
22:41;22:42;"but not literally."""
22:42;22:44;"I feel like that's how a lot of people feel."
22:44;22:49;"But you're saying, at least in modern American history, there's a literal connection between"
22:49;22:54;"controlling and catching slaves and modern policing."
22:54;22:55;"That's right."
22:55;23:01;"In the South, it took this very overt form, and in the North, it took a more indirect form."
23:01;23:07;"Initially, it took the form of slave catching, which was one of the functions of early police"
23:07;23:11;"was to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act."
23:11;23:17;"And this became a major function, and sometimes this involved getting rewards and things like that."
23:17;23:23;"But we also don't want to reduce this to just a conversation about slavery, because this"
23:23;23:30;"is also a conversation about the suppression of workers' movements in the rise of industrialization."
23:30;23:33;"And it's also a story about colonialism."
23:33;23:38;"Another really early police force in the United States was the Texas Rangers, which still"
23:38;23:40;"exists today."
23:40;23:47;"But their primary job was to drive out the indigenous population and then Mexican and"
23:47;23:51;"Spanish landowners to make way for white settlement."
23:51;23:57;"And also, you know, the precursor of the London Metropolitan Police, which was created by"
23:57;24:01;"Sir Robert Peel, Robert, Bob, the Bobbies."
24:01;24:04;"No one ever talks about, well, where did he get this idea from?"
24:04;24:06;"Like, it just fell out of the sky."
24:06;24:12;"But his prior job was that he was in charge of the English occupation of Ireland, a colonial"
24:12;24:13;"occupation."
24:13;24:20;"And he develops the Irish Peace Preservation Force as this kind of hybrid precursor to"
24:20;24:21;"policing."
24:21;24:27;"And their primary job was to put down so-called agricultural outrages, which were really peasant"
24:27;24:29;"uprisings against English landlords."
25:16;25:25;"I guess one question, just to like really understand what the difference is."
25:25;25:31;"So in Ireland, for instance, this guy Robert Peel, who then goes on to form the first modern"
25:31;25:35;"police force in London, he creates a new type of policing."
25:35;25:40;"So before that, there weren't cops, so to speak, there was the military."
25:40;25:46;"In the colonial context, they relied on the military and some militias."
25:46;25:53;"And one of the reasons that Peel had to invent this new thing was at that period, the British"
25:53;26:00;"military was fighting Napoleon, and he couldn't get enough troops to control the Irish countryside."
26:00;26:06;"Also, when you use military troops to control that kind of stuff, a lot of people tend to"
26:06;26:11;"get shot and killed, which creates a kind of crisis of legitimacy for the occupation."
26:11;26:13;"It just stirs up more resistance."
26:13;26:19;"And so the Irish Peace Preservation Force was embedded in local communities and had this"
26:19;26:22;"kind of law enforcement patina to it."
26:22;26:30;"That way, they were able to identify incipient uprisings more quickly and intervene preemptively"
26:30;26:32;"and less violently."
26:32;26:38;"And this allowed the colonial regime to function ultimately much more efficiently."
26:38;26:43;"And of course, that's what he was trying to transfer to London is how do we deal with"
26:43;26:51;"this massive influx of workers from the countryside who've been displaced by agricultural changes?"
26:51;26:57;"So the modern policing was in some ways a way to create an alternative to military intervention?"
26:57;26:58;"Exactly."
26:58;27:03;"Or the militia, which is essentially like our National Guard today in many ways."
27:03;27:12;"In New York, there was a long history of rioting in which the militia just opened fire on large"
27:12;27:15;"crowds until the invention of policing."
27:15;27:20;"There's a long history of the doctor's riots and the theater riots and the this and that"
27:20;27:21;"riots."
27:21;27:25;"And the way those riots were controlled is that the militia would be called out."
27:25;27:28;"They would line up, order people to disperse."
27:28;27:31;"And if they didn't disperse, they opened fire on the crowd."
27:31;27:35;"In some ways, when you put it that way, it's like a positive development, right?"
27:35;27:36;"Right."
27:36;27:39;"And it almost seems like it's coming full circle with the militarization of the police"
27:39;27:40;"force again."
27:40;27:46;"So you kind of feel like modern policing never was able to move past its origin story."
27:46;27:52;"Because, yeah, like the way you put it, the idea of embedded local people who are not"
27:52;27:57;"just opening fire on crowds seems like pointing in the right direction."
27:57;28:02;"But to you and in your research, because it was always crafted as a means of controlling"
28:02;28:08;"people, stopping labor movements, controlling slaves, its mission never kind of changed"
28:08;28:09;"in a sense?"
28:09;28:16;"We've managed to kind of manufacture a certain level of order in society in a less violent"
28:16;28:18;"way than the militia."
28:18;28:21;"But the militia was not called out very often."
28:21;28:24;"And people had a lot more social freedom."
28:24;28:27;"And yes, life was a little bit more disorderly."
28:27;28:30;"But there were a lot of benefits that went with that."
28:30;28:36;"At the same time, the order that's been crafted by this new institution does not benefit everyone"
28:36;28:37;"equally."
28:37;28:43;"And it hasn't really benefited African-Americans in a whole variety of ways over the last 150"
28:43;28:44;"years."
28:44;28:45;"Right."
28:45;28:52;"So it allows these regimes of economic exploitation to continue to function."
28:52;28:57;"So, yes, it's less overtly violent in its extremes."
28:57;29:03;"But there's also this constant everyday violence that usually doesn't result in death, but"
29:03;29:06;"can be demeaning and degrading nonetheless."
29:06;29:12;"Obviously, the average person who's getting on social media to flex their opinion is not"
29:12;29:15;"an academic with the breadth of knowledge that you have."
29:15;29:20;"But one very common thing you see, I've seen it in the comments section on my own Instagram,"
29:20;29:26;"anytime somebody criticizes the police force or the actions of the police, a very common"
29:26;29:32;"refrain from kind of pro-cop type people is, you don't want somebody to go to if you got"
29:32;29:33;"robbed."
29:33;29:37;"Like, do you really think that the world can function without any type of authority?"
29:37;29:42;"What's your response when you encounter that kind of just like really simple like, oh,"
29:42;29:46;"what, so you don't want somebody to go to if you get robbed or hurt?"
29:46;29:47;"Delete?"
29:47;29:50;"No, that's not my response."
29:50;29:54;"So there's a few things to unpack here."
29:54;30:02;"One is that, you know, often these are comments driven by a kind of thin blue line mentality"
30:02;30:10;"that just accepts this idea that the only possible solution to a problem is a punitive"
30:10;30:12;"and coercive solution."
30:12;30:17;"And so they have a very pessimistic understanding about the world."
30:17;30:23;"They assume that everyone would be a robber and a rapist and a murderer, except, of course,"
30:23;30:24;"them."
30:24;30:27;"So this is a misunderstanding about human nature."
30:27;30:31;"You know, if we look at wealthy communities, they don't have a lot of policing and they"
30:31;30:35;"manage to figure things out fairly well without that."
30:35;30:40;"But it's certainly true that there are a lot of communities that have very serious public"
30:40;30:42;"safety challenges."
30:42;30:48;"What I'm proposing is not any kind of situation where tomorrow you flip some magic switch"
30:48;30:50;"and there are no police."
30:50;30:54;"What I'm talking about is a process that's embedded in a set of principles."
30:54;31:02;"And the process is that we look to try to reduce our reliance on coercive and punitive"
31:02;31:05;"interventions as much as we possibly can."
31:05;31:11;"That when we look at community problems, we try to find solutions that are effective,"
31:11;31:16;"that are done in a cost effective way, and that treat people with as much human dignity"
31:16;31:18;"as possible."
31:18;31:21;"And policing kind of fails on all these measures."
31:21;31:25;"I love that way that you put it, and that was the feeling I got reading your book too,"
31:25;31:32;"is that when you talk about that kind of gotcha point that sometimes people make where they're"
31:32;31:33;"like, ""Oh, what?"
31:33;31:35;"So there's magically not going to be problems?"""
31:35;31:39;"You're not saying there will no longer be problems that need to be addressed."
31:39;31:42;"And like you put it, there sometimes are major problems that need to be addressed when people"
31:42;31:45;"live together, problems of safety and harm."
31:45;31:51;"The question, and this is where the origins of all this stuff become very important, is"
31:51;31:53;"that there are many ways to solve problems."
31:53;31:57;"And like you said, coercive and punitive measures are very ineffective."
31:57;32:01;"And there's an interesting part of your book too, where you quote a police officer who's"
32:01;32:07;"kind of complaining about how many things fall under the purview of the police force."
32:07;32:09;"And it's interesting to think about."
32:09;32:12;"This is the type of, I mean, you've been researching this for a long time, so maybe"
32:12;32:17;"for you it's kind of basic, but it's an interesting perspective shift to realize that,"
32:17;32:18;"you know, we take it as forgiven."
32:18;32:20;"Cops enforce the law, right?"
32:20;32:22;"And they do it in a coercive and punitive way."
32:22;32:24;"They drag people to jail."
32:24;32:27;"They can use violence if they feel they need to."
32:27;32:31;"But it was interesting to think, not all laws are enforced by police officers, right?"
32:31;32:37;"The people who go check out the kitchen at a Chipotle and decide if that Chipotle gets"
32:37;32:38;"an A or a B, right?"
32:38;32:40;"Those are not police officers."
32:40;32:42;"It's a different group of people."
32:42;32:47;"And it's kind of like a very naive insight, but it's hard sometimes to step back and"
32:47;32:52;"realize that not everything that the police take care of, they in particular need to take care of."
32:52;32:57;"And one interesting point in your book is that you talk about the fact that right now,"
32:57;33:02;"the war on drugs is the most damaging and ineffective form of policing facing us."
33:02;33:08;"And the fact that dealing with drugs and drug offenses is under the purview of the police"
33:08;33:11;"creates so many situations that lead to violence."
33:11;33:14;"Jails ruin so many lives, ruins communities."
33:14;33:18;"And one point that you make is that some people probably wonder,"
33:18;33:21;"""Well, what would happen if drugs were legal? Wouldn't that lead to craziness?"""
33:21;33:25;"But as you point out in your book, there are two things that are more or less legal everywhere now"
33:25;33:28;"that used to not be, and that's alcohol and gambling."
33:28;33:32;"So actually in the history of this country, we have some pretty good insight into what"
33:32;33:36;"it looks like when the police are in charge of criminalizing one thing and what it looks"
33:36;33:38;"like when they're no longer in charge of that."
33:38;33:42;"So can you talk about those examples and how that might be, can help us with our"
33:42;33:45;"modern thinking about what police need to be in charge of?"
33:45;33:49;"Yeah, well, let's think about the case of Eric Garner for a second, right?"
33:49;33:52;"Who was killed by police in New York."
33:52;33:58;"The offense that he was alleged to have been engaged in was that he was selling untaxed cigarettes."
33:58;34:03;"But why is that a matter for the police? It's a tax problem."
34:03;34:06;"I mean, you could even ask the question, why is that illegal in the first place?"
34:06;34:12;"Well, there's that, right? We could ask questions about the decisions about what gets taxed,"
34:12;34:16;"what gets made illegal, what gets highly regulated."
34:16;34:23;"And ideally, that should be based on some kind of robust consideration about relative harms"
34:23;34:28;"and the most effective strategies for reducing those harms."
34:28;34:34;"So that offense should never have been addressed by police in the first place."
34:34;34:37;"And Eric Garner would still be alive."
34:37;34:44;"And the laws that we are asking the police to enforce are not handed down by God,"
34:44;34:46;"despite what some people might think."
34:46;34:48;"They're political decisions."
34:48;34:54;"So the decision to make drugs illegal, but alcohol legal, is based on a lot of really"
34:54;35:00;"problematic calculations, right? Nixon ramps up the drug war for political purposes,"
35:00;35:03;"not for public safety or public health purposes."
35:03;35:10;"So when we, for instance, undertake reforms to policing that are intended to just make the police"
35:10;35:18;"more efficient, effective, professional enforcers of the law, but we don't actually interrogate"
35:18;35:23;"the laws they're being asked to enforce, we just open ourselves up to more abuse."
35:23;35:28;"I sometimes say, you know, if you're concerned about the racial disparities in drug arrests,"
35:28;35:32;"the solution to that is not to give narcotics units anti-bias training."
35:32;35:34;"It's to get rid of the war on drugs."
35:34;35:39;"And Portugal has done this, right? In Portugal, all drugs have been decriminalized."
35:39;35:43;"They just took police out of it and turned it over to the public health system."
35:43;35:46;"So can you explain that a little bit? Because this is a great example of,"
35:46;35:51;"in Portugal, they're not saying, ""No problems ever arise from drugs, so we're not even going to worry about it."""
35:51;35:55;"Rather, they chose to not have it be addressed by police officers."
35:55;36:01;"Because obviously, if drugs are decriminalized in Portugal, you're still going to have problems with addiction."
36:01;36:07;"People could still die from drugs. But so how is that dealt with, rather than having the police deal with it?"
36:07;36:13;"In Portugal, they basically have adopted a public health harm reduction strategy."
36:13;36:19;"Portugal had a terrible intravenous drug injection drug use problem."
36:19;36:25;"And it was producing high levels of HIV transmission and overdoses."
36:25;36:28;"And they tried using policing to crack down on this."
36:28;36:34;"And all it did was drive it into even deeper crevices, more underground black markets,"
36:34;36:39;"where people did not know what they were getting, where they couldn't get medical help."
36:39;36:43;"People were ending up in prison. And they said, ""This is not working."
36:43;36:51;"What if instead we acknowledge the fact that there's no way to prevent people from getting drugs?"""
36:51;36:57;"In the U.S., we've had a war on drugs for 40 years, and anybody can get any kind of drugs they want."
36:57;37:02;"Instead, what if we tried to identify what the most important harms are"
37:02;37:06;"that come from people's problematic relationships with drugs,"
37:06;37:12;"and try to actually reduce those harms through things like safe injection facilities,"
37:12;37:19;"needle exchanges, access to high-quality treatment programs on demand,"
37:19;37:22;"none of which are available in the United States."
37:22;37:27;"And as a result, HIV infection rates have gone down, the most in Europe."
37:27;37:33;"Overdoses are down. And civilization in Portugal has not collapsed."
37:33;37:36;"Right. It sounds like it's, in many ways, much better."
37:36;37:38;"They're very happy with it."
38:23;38:27;"So right now, I think a lot of what we see on social media,"
38:27;38:30;"depending on who you follow, you might see all sorts of stuff."
38:30;38:35;"You might see some real far-lefty anarchist type saying, ""Literally abolish the police."""
38:35;38:38;"And you might see the phrase, ""Defund the police."""
38:38;38:42;"And then you also see there's a campaign now called ""8 Can't Wait,"""
38:42;38:47;"which is a series of eight reforms involving things like banning chokeholds"
38:47;38:49;"and always warning before you fire."
38:49;38:53;"These are three things that I've noticed kind of trending on social media."
38:53;38:56;"Do you have opinions on these? Have you been monitoring this?"
38:56;38:57;"Yeah, of course."
38:57;39:00;"Which one fits your view and your understanding of the problem?"
39:00;39:07;"So ""8 Can't Wait"" is coming from D-Ray and Sam Sengenway and Campaign Zero."
39:07;39:16;"And these guys have been trying to identify specific targeted interventions in policing"
39:16;39:22;"that have some evidence to support them that might reduce the harms of policing."
39:22;39:30;"But D-Ray came out with a big article where he said, ""Plus, we got to defund the police."""
39:30;39:33;"For D-Ray, it's not an either/or. These things go in tandem."
39:33;39:35;"It's not an either/or. It's not an either/or."
39:35;39:40;"My view is that the ""8 Can't Wait"" stuff at least has some evidence behind it"
39:40;39:45;"in a way that a lot of the stuff in the Obama report didn't, like implicit bias training."
39:45;39:47;"There's just no evidence that works."
39:47;39:54;"It's just providing political cover for politicians and police chiefs to say they're doing something about racism."
39:54;39:59;"I'm not so optimistic that these eight things are really going to do the trick."
39:59;40:10;"And also, the political leverage to get them implemented is going to require a massive campaign to defund the police."
40:10;40:17;"And ultimately, ultimately, the defund the police thing I think points us in the right direction anyway,"
40:17;40:24;"which is that we've just got to quit turning every social problem under the sun over to the police to manage."
40:24;40:36;"Because a totally lawful, nonviolent, procedurally proper drug arrest is still going to ruin someone's life for no damn good reason."
40:36;40:38;"There's no justice in that."
40:38;40:42;"So the defund movement has more clarity about that."
40:42;40:45;"It's not just about zeroing out the police budget, right?"
40:45;40:52;"It's about chipping away at the police budget and shifting those resources to community-identified needs."
40:52;40:57;"And there are a lot of campaigns around the country that have been calling for this."
40:57;40:59;"They've got specific dollar targets."
40:59;41:03;"They're testifying at city council budget hearings."
41:03;41:08;"They've identified the community interventions that they want the money transferred to."
41:08;41:10;"And I think this is incredibly important."
41:10;41:13;"Is this different than abolish the police?"
41:13;41:18;"Well, there are different strains in the whole abolish the police world."
41:18;41:28;"For most people who are involved in actual organizing around this issue, they support these defund the police movements."
41:28;41:39;"And they're also engaged in trying to figure out how do we get to some kind of a world where policing in prisons don't have to be in our lives."
41:39;41:42;"But they understand that that's not going to happen tomorrow."
41:42;41:44;"That's something we're building towards."
41:44;41:46;"It's a vision that guides our work."
41:46;41:49;"And frankly, I put myself in that camp."
41:49;41:55;"I don't know what that other world is going to be, but I know it's not going to be filled with police."
41:55;42:04;"And that to the extent that we can get police out of our lives and build up communities, that's part of that process of building a better world."
42:04;42:05;"That makes a lot of sense to me."
42:05;42:11;"And I always – people talk so much about good cops versus bad cops in moments like this."
42:11;42:16;"And you see some people say all cops are bad because they're tasked with enforcing these unjust laws."
42:16;42:20;"And some people say, well, hold on, you know, the classic bad apple thing we've heard a million times."
42:20;42:21;"Some cops are good."
42:21;42:29;"And I can't help but think that this concept of defunding the police would ultimately create other jobs for civic-minded people."
42:29;42:38;"I'm totally willing to believe that there are many people who join the police force because they think it's the best way that they can help keep a community safe."
42:38;42:39;"Right?"
42:39;42:40;"Absolutely."
42:40;42:46;"And so I'm not going to pretend that every single person who joins the police force only does it to bash somebody's head in."
42:46;42:53;"In that sense, I believe that there are people who go into the force with very good intentions and probably do their best once they're there."
42:53;43:03;"But the idea that they are then tasked with covering all these different things, everything from dealing with somebody passing a counterfeit bill, perhaps, to
busting people for drugs."
43:03;43:11;"I guess one way to think about it, too, because I think sometimes people hear this phrase ""defund the police"" and they think, like you said, they might have this vision,
what, down to zero?"
43:11;43:15;"But what you're talking about is that every city, every government has a budget, right?"
43:15;43:22;"If it's a big pie that's going to the police and part of it is so that the police can deal with something like counterfeit bills or drugs,"
43:22;43:25;"partially what you're saying is that that money wouldn't disappear."
43:25;43:30;"That money would still go towards dealing with these issues, but in a different way."
43:30;43:40;"There still would be jobs for civic-minded people who maybe wanted to help a community have less problems with drugs, but it wouldn't necessarily be the coercive,
punitive way, right?"
43:40;43:42;"That's right. That's right."
43:42;43:45;"You know, let me tell you a story. I've been a police scholar for over 20 years."
43:45;43:49;"I know police all over the world. I talk to police."
43:49;43:53;"You're absolutely right. They think they're trying to help."
43:53;44:00;"Some police officers came to a talk I gave in Houston recently, and we hung out afterwards for a little bit and talked."
44:00;44:10;"And these were guys of color who had grown up in neighborhoods where they had been mistreated by police, and they thought, ""I want to do something to help the community."
44:10;44:14;"Maybe if I go into policing, I can help change the culture of policing."""
44:14;44:18;"And they're like, ""It didn't work. We could not change the culture."""
44:18;44:37;"And I said, ""Look, when you were looking to go into the police, if you had had the choice between a job as a police officer and a job working in a community center, coaching
football and mentoring teenagers for the same pay and benefits, which of those jobs would you have taken?"""
44:37;44:46;"And, of course, they laughed. It's, ""Oh, my God, we would love to have coached football and worked with kids in the community and helped straighten them out, but there
were no such jobs."""
44:46;44:54;"And I'm like, ""Exactly. Why are there never those jobs, but the police department is always hiring?"""
44:54;45:13;"And we know that when we look at these city budgets, it's not because there isn't money, because the money is going for the police to deal with the same issues, which is
why getting that money to go to other things, it could literally, like in this instance you gave, this could literally be some of the same people who took that job."
45:13;45:21;"But if there was another job, another choice, I'm sure it would be less traumatic for them, less traumatic for the community. It makes a lot of sense."
45:21;45:33;"I just hope that in this moment, when a lot of eyes are on this issue, that it can be linked to the things that you're talking about, because I think the failure to link them
is often why these moments kind of flame out quickly."
45:33;45:48;"I mean, the good news is that policing is mostly a local issue, and we have these vibrant movements in cities across the country, so we don't have to fix the nightmare in
Washington to make some real progress on this."
45:48;45:59;"And local politics, it really matters if you can get 100 people to turn out to a budget hearing, and we should be able to do that. And it's happening. It's happening."
45:59;46:03;"Well, that's good. That's an optimistic note to end on. Turning out to budget hearings."
46:03;46:08;"I know. It seems weak in some ways, but it's an intervention."
46:08;46:15;"Absolutely. Well, thanks so much, Alex. Great talking to you. I recommend your book to everybody, and yeah, we appreciate it."
46:15;46:17;"You bet. Thanks for having me on."
46:17;46:18;"Have a good one."
46:18;46:19;"Bye-bye."
46:38;46:44;"Something in the way, it treats me like you do"
46:44;46:56;"Too compelling when it feels so wrong next to me"
46:56;47:05;"We can live by the way, bring your body in"
47:06;47:15;"Take a good swing, oh now it's where love is the way"
47:15;47:18;"Time Crisis"
47:18;47:41;"Well, Alex S. Vitale, very interesting conversation. I gotta say, Jake, like for me, these connections that are probably very obvious to an academic like him who
researches this stuff, I really think to me and a lot of regular people, it's under-- I have sympathy for people who just want police to be less racist and do anti-bias
training."
47:41;47:58;"I have sympathy for them. It's not a crazy idea, right? You hear about a racist cop, a lot of people are gonna think like, ""Man, why is that guy racist?"" Fire him, hold him
accountable, and make sure that cops in the future are less racist. It's not crazy, and yet it does seem like it doesn't work."
47:58;48:09;"And there is something about like he was-- the moralizing about drugs, I really fear that we're like never gonna deal with that properly. You know what I mean?"
48:09;48:10;"Of course."
48:10;48:27;"It's amazing. In the past 10 years, everybody's so obsessed with like, you know, narcos and Sicario and Breaking Bad. People are so interested in like drugs as a
concept and stuff. And yet, I guess like Ronald Reagan and Nixon and Bill Clinton, they really did a number on everybody."
48:27;48:45;"Like, a lot, a lot of people have fully been convinced that drugs are so bad that they need to be illegal and they need to be enforced by people with guns and people need to
be thrown in jail. It's amazing how difficult it is to break through that. And I've always felt like, it's so insane that-- yeah, go ahead."
48:45;49:04;"I mean, I feel like 30, 40, 50 years ago, maybe a broader swath of the public legitimately like feared drugs and thought that they would like destroy the society. And I
feel like now it's more a sense of political inertia. I feel like people are now a little more savvy about that."
49:04;49:06;"Yeah, a little more."
49:06;49:15;"A little more. And they're just more of like, throw their hands up at like the impossibility of instituting any sort of major reform on a national level."
49:15;49:19;"Well, obviously we've seen the attitudes towards marijuana have shifted and you--"
49:19;49:20;"Yeah, I think--"
49:20;49:21;"--the states went legal."
49:21;49:23;"I think that'll change in our lifetime."
49:23;49:44;"You always hear though that even in places like Colorado, there's still arresting black and Hispanic people at a higher level for marijuana related charges for like
not following the letter of the law. So there's always going to be this lag when these federal laws still exist. You know, it's not going to be simple, but obviously it's
got to be a little bit better."
49:44;50:03;"But yeah, I think you're right. Well, and one thing, you know, I didn't want to just like summarize this whole book to him when we talked to him. But one thing that he talks
about too though is like, I think you're right, Jake, that there was a moment, definitely in the 20th century, where the average American did have more like extreme
feelings about drugs being bad and stuff. But it's also--"
50:03;50:06;"This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs."
50:06;50:15;"I mean, we should do a whole episode about that. Because really, the changes in attitude towards something, it's marketing. This was marketed to us about like how bad
drugs are."
50:15;50:16;"Yeah."
50:16;50:41;"This is where you get into tricky territory, because there could be somebody listening who knows somebody who straight up died because of their relationship with
drugs. First of all, less people die when drugs are managed and not illegal. So it doesn't mean that drugs don't have serious problems. It just means that making them
illegal and using the cops to enforce it aren't the best tools. But it's interesting to think about the fact, and he kind of in his book, he gives you like a quick history."
50:41;51:01;"In the 19th century, cocaine, opium, and heroin were all legal. And marijuana too. It's increasingly arbitrated. So like, well, why did opium become illegal? In the
book, he talks about the fact that opium was really associated with Chinese people. And for a long time, there'd be like opium dens in Chinatown, and nobody really
cared."
51:01;51:26;"And then there started to become this thing where kind of like upper class white women, it became in vogue for them to go to an opium den in Chinatown and like get high. And
that's when it started to be seen as this kind of racialized thing about like racial mixing, and we don't want these people together. And he makes similar cases for how
marijuana was associated with the Mexican border. Later, it was associated with jazz music and black people."
51:26;51:40;"And he even talks about this is really crazy. I didn't know this. I always knew that cocaine, obviously, Coca Cola, right, used to have cocaine in it famously. Yeah, so I
knew that cocaine used to be legal. But this is a really crazy one that he does in this book."
51:40;51:59;"So cocaine became illegal, and was often associated with African Americans. And it was part of this like anger about them taking cocaine. Before the slaves were free
in this country, it was not uncommon that slave masters would give cocaine to slaves to make them work longer and harder."
51:59;52:15;"Brutal. There are places in this country where people were given cocaine to work. And then when they became free, and occasionally wanted to take it for fun. That's
when the problem started. Our attitude and our moralizing about drugs is just so out of control."
52:15;52:39;"Another example I was thinking of this, because I think this is such a fundamental idea that I'm still wrapping my head around, but we can't take it as a given that
policing is the way to solve all problems. And we talked about like, the boys in blue don't come through with nightsticks and guns, when a restaurant has like a
violation with their like oven ventilation."
52:39;52:57;"Yeah. We accept as a society that if like, the stove is too close to the bathroom in the kitchen at a restaurant or something, we accept that there's a reasonable way to
deal with it through a fine, or through sending in, who are the people who are in charge of that just like in a city, just the city health board."
52:57;52:59;"Yeah, restaurant inspectors."
52:59;53:04;"Restaurant inspectors don't haul you to jail. And they're just like, you're gonna be in jail for the next six months."
53:04;53:06;"You can't make bail."
53:06;53:20;"Yeah, you can't make bail. You know, finally, you get out and you got to go tell the judge like, I will fix the ventilation system. I recognize that I pose the danger to the
clientele of the restaurant. And then the even crazier example, of course, is white collar criminals."
53:20;53:25;"We're familiar with the idea of the FBI rolling in to maybe arrest somebody."
53:25;53:26;"Right."
53:26;53:35;"The idea that just like the local precinct would just send a bunch of guys in with guns, every time there's some sort of like financial impropriety. It obviously
doesn't happen."
53:35;53:36;"Right."
53:36;53:56;"The idea that I could just like call the cops and be like, I was just in the elevator. And there's these really two suspicious guys talking. And I think it was insider
trading. And I'm really stressed out. And then just like I call 911. And then just like five cops come. Like, who was it? It was two white guys. They're wearing like blue
blazers. And they just like start throwing dudes on the floor. Like, you're coming with us."
53:56;54:14;"It seems like an absurd example, but it just kind of reminds us that those people broke the law. They violated the social contract. And obviously, it's an even bigger
problem that there is never prosecution for bankers or something. But even then, I'm not saying that these people should be thrown on the ground by the police either."
54:14;54:36;"I'm just saying that we as a society have chosen which crimes and which problems cops with guns and weapons tackle. And it's not all of them. And when you start to like
take a step back, you realize like, yeah, it doesn't help everything to like, have the cops like, or even like if the IRS, if you just put the whole IRS became part of like
the local police force."
54:36;54:37;"Right."
54:37;54:42;"Let me see that f***ing receipt. Like, get heads on the ground. You know, like, it doesn't happen for good reason."
55:10;55:32;"I had a thought when you were talking about things that used to be legal, you know, like in the 19th century. I mean, when I was done with that protest, and I was, you know,
there's all these like National Guard and police who are so heavily armed. And I was thinking about a few months ago during the COVID thing, those like militias going
into the statehouse in Michigan."
55:32;55:58;"And I was like, wow, that would not fly down here if people showed up with guns just to march down, peacefully march down the street. I was doing a little reading about it.
And open carry was legal in California until 1967, when Governor Ronald Reagan signed a law banning the open carry of weapons in California. And you have to assume that
must go back to like 1849, like Gold Rush, like the Wild West."
55:58;55:59;"Yeah, the Wild West."
55:59;56:20;"You walk in a saloon with a gun. Now, smash cut to 1967. It's like suburban California. And what's happening is like, in Oakland, the Black Panthers are walking around
their neighborhood patrolling the neighborhood peacefully with shotguns, keeping an eye on the cops. And that did not fly. That was not a popular thing."
56:20;56:24;"So then the Republican Governor Ronald Reagan nipped that in the bud."
56:24;56:49;"It was a wildly popular bipartisan bill that passed in 1967. And then when the bill was being debated in Sacramento, the Black Panthers did march and walk straight into
the Capitol building, bearing arms, and then like peacefully left. But it was like a strange resonance to the militias in Michigan, but obviously with completely
different results legally."
56:49;56:50;"Right. That's a great point to make."
56:50;56:51;"It's just wild."
56:51;56:53;"And of course, you get to get back to alcohol."
56:53;56:54;"Oh, of course."
56:55;57:06;"Because we're so familiar with alcohol as being legal, because it's been legal for almost all of American history, except for one very violent and crime-ridden
10-year period when it was illegal in the 20s."
57:06;57:07;"Yeah."
57:07;57:26;"And that's what's so funny to me, is when you have these conversations about like alcohol versus weed, people think that's kind of like a stoner dorm room
conversation. It's like, ""I don't know, man. I feel like alcohol and weed are kind of similar."" And people are like, ""Well, I don't know about me, because for me, I had an
edible once and I got so high. Oh my God, I could have been anywhere."""
57:26;57:44;"And when I drink, it becomes this whole personal debate, almost an aesthetic debate too, about like, ""I don't like stoners, but I've known some cool alcoholics."" It
becomes this whole really personal thing. But when you really take a step back and you think about the fact that so many people die every year from alcohol and
alcohol-related stuff."
57:44;57:45;"Oh my God, dude."
57:45;57:55;"Driving drunk, whatever. And you just think about the fact that we understand that that's legal. There's never been a serious conversation about making alcohol
illegal in our lifetimes."
57:55;58:13;"Alcohol is way more destructive than weed. Weed's not really that destructive. Maybe some people like, go just get too far down the rabbit hole and kind of sit in front
of the TV all day smoking weed. But alcohol is brutal. I love booze, don't get me wrong, but it is awful for you and causes a lot of misery."
58:13;58:35;"It's amazing how much the conversation is often driven by just purely anecdotal bullsh*t where somebody's like, ""I mean, yeah, I've met a few people drink too much,
but I have a cousin. He hasn't worked in five years. He literally plays video games and eats Cheetos all day. He's a stoner."" It's like, okay, man, that sounds like your
aunt and uncle ought to have a chat."
58:35;58:49;"That's what's important is that some people like to pretend that the right is saying we need law and order and the left is kind of like, ""No, man, it's all good. There's no
problems. It's chill. Just chill out."""
58:49;59:00;"And truly people have this like idiotic worldview that one group of people cares about dealing with stuff and the other people saying, ""No, man, we don't need cops.
Everybody can just kind of like hash it out."""
59:00;59:11;"But that's not true either. And that's why I like Alex's point. There are problems in communities. There will always be problems in communities. And he always uses the
phrase harms."
59:11;59:21;"There are many harms associated with alcohol. There are harms associated with sex work. The point is not to pretend these are problems that we can just like hash out or
like not worry about."
59:21;59:36;"It's truly about are there other ways to tackle problems besides armed police and criminalization? If that's like the one takeaway that we can have and I hope the next
generation can like hold on to into their adulthood,"
59:36;59:51;"it's that nobody's pretending that there aren't serious problems facing people in a world with drugs and alcohol and exploitation and all these things. It's really
are there better ways to solve problems than criminalization and police?"
59:51;01:00:03;"That's the question you have to ask over and over again. And we're not like built to ask that question. You know, like we're built to like get up in arms about like, you
know, brutality and stuff, but we're not trained."
01:00:03;01:00:18;"Like every kid, for instance, in I don't know about like in the Deep South or something. I'm curious if any listeners are from the Deep South. Us like Northeast blue
state types, we grew up in our history book, learning about the civil rights movement."
01:00:18;01:00:31;"They didn't pretend to call the civil war, the war of Northern aggression or something like that. We were raised to understand that at least in a really basic way, the
treatment of black people and Native Americans was horrifying."
01:00:31;01:00:47;"We understood that the civil rights movement was just we saw the images of peaceful protesters being harassed and brutalized by police. I was taught that in a pretty
basic public school. I know that's not true all over the country, but I was taught that."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"As was I."
01:00:48;01:01:02;"But the one thing that nobody's being taught in schools is stuff like this. War on drug. These concepts about why are certain things criminal and other things aren't.
Those ideas seem so fundamental to eventually solving these problems."
01:01:02;01:01:19;"If all you leave a student with is like this feeling of like, man, I would never go like tell a black person they couldn't use a water fountain. All right, cool. In that
sense, you're better than a white person in the Jim Crow South. But you still accept these other ideas."
01:01:19;01:01:36;"You know, it's like the education, like the story of Americans and progress kind of ends in like 1980 or something. The thing that I fear is that you have a lot of people
right now saying people, especially white people, need to educate themselves about the history of racism in this country."
01:01:36;01:02:03;"Agreed. I 100% agree. There's a lot of ways to tell that story, though. And there's a version that the powers that be might prefer to be told that focuses on the 1960s,
that focuses on the racial biases of individuals like bad cops and individual bad people and never talks about stuff like the war on drugs or the history of the
racialized criminalization of drugs, things like that."
01:02:03;01:02:19;"Like, you know what I mean? It's like the lame version always wins. So if we're hitting this point in American society where you got everybody, every brand, for
instance, and we'll talk about that more, every brand from Ben and Jerry's to Amazon is chiming in about racial injustice."
01:02:19;01:02:39;"Okay, the topic is out there, but what version of it is the one that's going to be discussed at the dinner table and discussed in school? And the fact that the war on drugs
isn't like a big chapter in like a high school textbook, that's one of the defining features of American society for the past 50 years. It's transformative."
01:02:39;01:03:01;"Anyway, we can go on about this forever, but I do have to say that I recommend his book. And if you don't have time to read a whole book, I always recommend the documentary
that Ava DuVernay made called 13th, which talks about the 13th Amendment, talks about the war on drugs, talks about the relationship of slavery and policing black
people. It's on Netflix."
01:03:01;01:03:21;"It talks about these crucial moments, Nixon, Clinton, the presidents who really changed the relationship between policing drugs and specifically African
Americans. So like, please watch the 13th. It's one of the most straightforward and kind of tidy ways to take in a lot of this information in a short period of time."
01:03:51;01:04:06;"Now, Jake, you and I have both been pretty confined to Southern California. I don't know if you're planning any trips in the near future. You feel like you'd be ready to
like, you know, rip up for a camping trip in Eastern Oregon or that type of stuff that you do?"
01:04:06;01:04:20;"Yeah, we're going to do some camping up in the Sierras this summer and then go visit my folks. We're doing that in July. Although it's a little ambiguous depending on the
COVID situation, whether in stage two or three, but yes, that is the plan. But nothing that-"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"Right, you're starting to think about traveling elsewhere in the state."
01:04:23;01:04:28;"But just driving in the minivan with the dog up into the mountains and you know, nothing crazy."
01:04:28;01:04:56;"Well, there's a friend of the show who's always a little bit ahead of the curve. He's not waiting that long. He's back out there on the highways and byways of the United
States of America. And of course, I'm talking about winter. I was very moved to see on Winter's Instagram and Twitter that he was back out there starbucking again. And I
can't wait to hear from him. It was almost a little emotional. I saw him post somewhere where he was like, this is my first time sitting down in the Starbucks in three
months."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Yeah."
01:04:57;01:05:17;"I was like, damn, that's intense because he was very much confined up there in Rochester, New York. So anyway, we're going to check in with Winter, who has been back at it
again, starbucking across the country. And as I understand, attending some protests. So he's probably gonna have a lot of information for us about what's happening
out there in the United States of America."
01:05:17;01:05:21;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:05:25;01:05:26;"Hello?"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Oh, hey, what's up, Winter?"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Hey, how are you folks?"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Welcome back."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Yeah, glad to be back."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"To Time Crisis and back to starbucking."
01:05:32;01:05:52;"Yeah, I was going to do it from my car outside the new Starbucks in Flagstaff, but then I looked across the parking lot and there's a Planet Fitness there. And I gave them a
call and they actually had their showers working. Most don't. So it was good to take a shower after a lot of days."
01:05:52;01:06:00;"Right, because Planet Fitness is when you're starbucking and sometimes you sleep in the car. Planet Fitness is one of your go to shower resources."
01:06:00;01:06:06;"Yeah, and working out, you know, so I like to get, you know, try to get a run in even while I'm traveling."
01:06:06;01:06:12;"So you made it from Rochester, New York to Flagstaff, Arizona in a week? How long have you been back out on the road?"
01:06:12;01:06:17;"I left a week ago, Friday night from my co-working space in Rochester."
01:06:17;01:06:24;"You know, following you on social media, I feel like I saw you were in Missouri and not too Colorado."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"So you've just been burning across the country."
01:06:26;01:06:36;"Yeah, but I could have done this drive in like two or three days, except that I had to stop and work and I had to stop and protest. So things that you have to do and things that
are important."
01:06:36;01:06:49;"So Starbucks is the main purpose of being on the road to catch up on all these stores before the global recession leads to hundreds of closures like happened 10 years ago."
01:06:49;01:06:56;"Oh, wow. Your forecast is that a lot of these Starbucks that you're maybe going to right now might not be there in a couple of years."
01:06:56;01:07:06;"Or within the next year. That is my pessimistic forecast based on the Great Purge of 2008, 2009."
01:07:06;01:07:15;"But I'm not an economist. I don't have access to any data. This is just purely my gut telling me that some of these stores might not survive."
01:07:15;01:07:23;"As of a week ago when I left, there were still six U.S. stores that I had not been to that had not reopened."
01:07:23;01:07:33;"And I don't know why. I'm hoping that they will reopen. The biggest one that I'm worried about is the Salesforce building in downtown San Francisco."
01:07:33;01:07:42;"That's a new building that Salesforce, this growing IT company, built. They opened up a Starbucks there, corporate."
01:07:42;01:07:49;"Initially not open to the public, but I was told that it would be opening to the public."
01:07:49;01:08:00;"The question is, will they reopen that store after Salesforce announced that they're going to let a lot of their employees continue to work from home?"
01:08:00;01:08:05;"Right. So where have you stopped to protest?"
01:08:05;01:08:13;"I found myself at the new Starbucks in Reynoldsburg, just outside Columbus, Ohio, last Saturday night."
01:08:13;01:08:21;"And I actually found a place where I could dine in, plug in my computer, charge everything up."
01:08:21;01:08:26;"And I started Googling around and I realized, hey, wait a minute, there's probably some protests going on downtown."
01:08:26;01:08:34;"So I headed downtown and the streets were all closed. But I parked my car and managed to find where people were protesting."
01:08:34;01:08:41;"And that was a chaotic scene with people throwing bottles and then at some point rocks at the police."
01:08:41;01:08:46;"That's not what I was looking to get into. So I just observed."
01:08:46;01:08:56;"And that's where I noticed that the police were sort of, when they felt people were getting too rowdy, they would move from block to block and clear the block with the
rubber bullets."
01:08:56;01:09:05;"And of course, everybody would move in the other direction. I don't know how long it went, but once it started to get dark, I had to get out of there. I was exhausted."
01:09:05;01:09:10;"And I also have trouble seeing at night now, just something that comes with age."
01:09:10;01:09:16;"I had to get glasses recently and I broke them already. It's been less than a month and I sat on them."
01:09:16;01:09:20;"Yeah, that sounds intense."
01:09:20;01:09:26;"It seems like I've seen a few images of people vandalizing Starbucks. Have you been following this at all?"
01:09:26;01:09:32;"Absolutely. People are tweeting them at me. It's all over the news. I've passed Starbucks that were boarded up."
01:09:32;01:09:41;"I personally did not see anybody attacking a Starbucks. I did see some guy attacking another business and that's when the rubber bullets came out."
01:09:41;01:09:47;"Seems like protecting property is a high priority. I mean, you know, it's like you can't blame them."
01:09:47;01:09:51;"When you see images of a defaced Starbucks, do you feel any type of way about it?"
01:09:51;01:09:56;"No, honestly, I don't. What's going on in the country is so important."
01:09:56;01:10:05;"And what's been going on with past protests like Occupy Wall Street and some of the protests surrounding the World Trade Organization, right?"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Oh, yeah."
01:10:06;01:10:12;"Some of those. Starbucks is often a target because they're a symbol of big corporations."
01:10:12;01:10:20;"It's unfortunate. I wish it didn't happen, but I'm not going to take Starbucks's side."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"I guess my position is they can absorb the loss."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Yes."
01:10:24;01:10:32;"But I think protesting is important. What's going on here right now in this country is much more important than a hit that Starbucks takes to their profits."
01:10:32;01:10:37;"I certainly don't want any of their baristas to get hurt. I don't want anybody to get hurt."
01:10:37;01:10:43;"I know that some of them are probably fearing for their safety and I wish them well. I feel bad for them."
01:10:43;01:10:48;"But there's a whole group of Americans who feel for their safety every day. They're alive."
01:10:48;01:10:57;"Absolutely. And that's a good point because if you're talking about a moment where you heard about baristas getting hurt, for instance, that would be such a different
equation."
01:10:57;01:11:03;"Because then you're saying, is it OK for bystanders to get hurt in a protest about police violence? Of course not."
01:11:03;01:11:13;"Nobody would defend that. Is it OK for somebody to spray paint or smash a window in a handful of people in the course of a much larger protest?"
01:11:13;01:11:20;"That's not something to get up in arms about. And as you said, Starbucks can absorb it. We're not talking about the tiny mom and pop coffee spot."
01:11:20;01:11:28;"Those are the ones that I feel the worst for, especially coming on the heels of the pandemic. You have to feel for those people."
01:11:28;01:11:33;"Absolutely. So what have you been seeing just in the American coffee scene now that you're back on the road?"
01:11:33;01:11:38;"Because I know when you go out, you're not only hitting Starbucks, right? You're checking out the mom and pops too."
01:11:38;01:11:50;"Right. It's a wide array of modes of operation. This morning I was doing some work at Trifecta Coffee Company in Albuquerque and they had their patio open."
01:11:50;01:11:58;"But they were also pretty cool about letting me charge my equipment just inside the door while I was outside taking meetings."
01:11:58;01:12:09;"Others are walk up window only like Sweet Bloom in Denver. Best cup of coffee that I've had in, I don't know, six months."
01:12:09;01:12:13;"Just amazing, amazing brew there. It's been running the gamut."
01:12:13;01:12:21;"And if any barista seems more anxious to get the customers out of there as quickly as possible, I'm definitely going to respect that."
01:12:21;01:12:27;"Because from their perspective, it's a health issue. They don't want to get sick and die or bring it home to their family members."
01:12:27;01:12:38;"Oh, absolutely. I saw on Instagram that you did go sit in at least one Starbucks. So have you been to Starbucks that are fully back to normal?"
01:12:38;01:12:42;"That is the only one in Evergreen, Colorado that I have run into."
01:12:42;01:12:53;"I know that there are more because either the manager or the district manager who was there giving instructions to the other partners indicated to me that they were a
trial store."
01:12:53;01:13:04;"Based on how it goes, they'll use that to inform the processes that will be used at other stores as they open up their cafe seating."
01:13:04;01:13:09;"But I don't have a list of which stores have open lobbies as of right now."
01:13:09;01:13:14;"At the Evergreen, Colorado Starbucks, what was the vibe inside? Were there people just sitting down?"
01:13:14;01:13:25;"There was literally nobody. I got there on, what was it, a couple nights ago? I guess Wednesday night, maybe about 7.30. They were closing at 8."
01:13:25;01:13:33;"There was a lady customer and the manager or district manager was explaining to her that she could sit, but she opted to leave."
01:13:33;01:13:38;"I stuck around and just charged up my stuff, uploaded my photos."
01:13:38;01:13:47;"I returned the next morning to get breakfast and just continued to charge up, download a bunch of stuff, upload photos, figure out what I was going to do for the day."
01:13:47;01:13:54;"There was nobody there. I have not yet been in a Starbucks situation where there were other customers."
01:13:54;01:13:58;"Similarly, P.T.'s Coffee in Topeka, Kansas."
01:13:58;01:14:04;"That was the first independent coffeehouse that I'd encountered since this pandemic started that had dine-in seating."
01:14:04;01:14:08;"When I was there, there was one lady in the middle of the store working."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"She was not wearing a mask. All the baristas were wearing a mask."
01:14:11;01:14:17;"I took my coffee and I headed off to the furthest corner I could find and then I was able to work."
01:14:17;01:14:25;"I felt comfortable working without a mask because I was a good couple hundred meters, maybe 300 meters away from the baristas behind the counter."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Where are you heading? You're almost back in California, it sounds like."
01:14:28;01:14:32;"Almost, give or take, a few dozen Starbucks."
01:14:32;01:14:44;"My next one, I guess, would be down in Cottonwood, Arizona, then down to Phoenix tomorrow, simply because there's indications that there's different marches in
different areas planned."
01:14:44;01:14:50;"I want to hook up with a march. Hopefully, the heat won't kill me."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Daytime downtown Phoenix, that sounds pretty good."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"I don't know how my body's going to handle that."
01:14:55;01:15:02;"A few Time Crisis episodes ago, I was talking about the sprint Scrabble, where you play Scrabble and then run."
01:15:02;01:15:13;"The very first time that I did that was down in Orlando, middle of the summer, during the National Scrabble Championship, around 1 or 2 p.m., humidity in the air."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"I had to forfeit because I was starting to get dizzy."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"I'm just not used to running in the heat."
01:15:19;01:15:25;"So it's going to be interesting to see how I handle walking in the heat tomorrow, if it's something that starts at noon or 1 p.m."
01:15:25;01:15:29;"I haven't been able to figure out yet exactly where the best march is."
01:15:29;01:15:34;"And so you have a whole route? Are you doing kind of like a U? Will you end up back in Rochester?"
01:15:34;01:15:38;"I will end up back in Rochester. My route keeps changing every time I look at the map."
01:15:38;01:15:46;"I'm just making judgment calls about which Starbucks I'm going to skip and just hope that they don't shut down."
01:15:46;01:15:57;"Because time-wise, in a month, I cannot get to every Starbucks you would have seen on the map that I posted last week or the map that's on my website right now."
01:15:57;01:16:02;"There's just like – I'm in Flagstaff. I was in Gallup, New Mexico earlier."
01:16:02;01:16:05;"I could have gone down to Show Low, but that was just too big a detour."
01:16:05;01:16:13;"I couldn't make it to Show Low, then back up to Flagstaff in time for my happy hour, virtual happy hour with the folks at work."
01:16:13;01:16:16;"I just burned too much time if I tried to get every single store."
01:16:16;01:16:22;"And there's another factor. I'm not going to get all the stores anyway because COVID closures."
01:16:22;01:16:33;"So that's the other new thing. Kansas City, Missouri, I had to leave one store there because somebody had tested positive for COVID, and what Starbucks is doing is
shutting the store down."
01:16:33;01:16:39;"I was told two weeks. I was told the same thing about a store in Littleton, Colorado."
01:16:39;01:16:43;"That's the second one that I encountered that was closed due to this."
01:16:43;01:16:46;"They had COVID, and they shut down for two weeks."
01:16:46;01:16:55;"Yeah, and so I have every reason to think that I'm going to encounter stores somewhere in Arizona, California, all the way up through Oregon, Washington."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"Just law of averages says that somebody's going to test positive and they're going to shut the store down."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"It might not necessarily be for two weeks each time."
01:17:02;01:17:07;"I just read about a store in Aldergrove. I think that's up in BC, but that's Canada."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"Somebody tested positive. They had it shut down for two days."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"So I'm not exactly sure."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Just give it a good scrub."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"How long?"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Send them home. Give it a good scrub."
01:17:16;01:17:24;"What I was told by a barista in Kansas City, Missouri, was they want everybody to isolate for the 14-day period."
01:17:24;01:17:27;"So they don't have any employees to come work."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"That's what my understanding is."
01:17:29;01:17:35;"But again, this isn't necessarily being handled the exact same way in every region of the United States."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"It might not be handled the same way in Canada."
01:17:37;01:17:42;"And certainly, the district manager is going to have some autonomy about their response."
01:17:42;01:17:51;"That's what Kevin Johnson explicitly said in an email that went out to everybody on the app, that these decisions were going to be made at a local level."
01:17:51;01:17:58;"Well, thanks so much for checking in, Winter. Stay safe, and I hope you have a great time at the protest tomorrow."
01:17:58;01:18:04;"Just want to do my part. I feel like something is happening right now, and I want to contribute."
01:18:04;01:18:11;"Honestly, I feel guilty that I haven't protested more during my life, but I guess better late than never, right?"
01:18:11;01:18:19;"Who knows? You might be in the top 1 percentile of Americans covering geographic range for protests due to your lifestyle."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"Sure, but let's not – definitely don't want to make this about me."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"Right, of course. You're out there at a lot of different places. That's pretty cool."
01:18:25;01:18:28;"All right, well, great, man. Good luck, and we'll check in again soon."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"Wonderful talking to you. Good to see you guys."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"Likewise. Good to see you, Winter."
01:18:32;01:18:36;"Take care and be safe. I know that you're protesting too, Jake, so be safe."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"You too, bud."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Winter, before you go, are you on – do you play Words with Friends?"
01:18:40;01:18:46;"[Laughs]"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"Damn, ice cold."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Oh my God. I'll have to text you."
01:18:50;01:18:54;"He just iced you – no, that was just an accident, but that was some timing."
01:18:54;01:18:58;"Just Seinfeld. Winter, do you play Words with Friends? No."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Winter, would you be my Facebook friend?"
01:19:40;01:19:43;"All right, so next up we're going to check in with a friend of the show, Mero,"
01:19:43;01:19:49;"see what's going on with him, see if he has any takes on what's happening in the country."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"I know he does, so let's go ahead and get him on the phone and check in."
01:19:53;01:19:57;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"[Phone ringing]"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Hey!"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"Mero, welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:20:03;01:20:08;"Very good to be back. I haven't spoken to you in over nine hours, you know what I'm saying?"
01:20:08;01:20:13;"That's true. We were on the phone yesterday, but that wasn't being recorded, I hope."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"It might be."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"I mean, you never know."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"That's a very boring NSA conversation."
01:20:18;01:20:24;"It depends if we said any of those key words that start—isn't that like the law that if there's certain key words,"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"they can just start the tape recording?"
01:20:26;01:20:30;"I need a list of those words so I can just say them as soon as I get on the phone with somebody instead of saying hello."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"I can just get on the phone and be like, ""Yo, Antifa, Dutch to the West. Yo, America must fall."""
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Yeah."
01:20:36;01:20:42;"Well, I think it's just to kick things off, we were going to do a segment where we were talking to this academic"
01:20:42;01:20:48;"before a professor of sociology and also writer, Alex S. Vitale, about his book, ""End of Policing."""
01:20:48;01:20:54;"So, you know, he was giving us kind of like the facts about the origins of policing and why things are—"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"certain things are criminalized."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"But we also wanted to start talking about just some of the responses we've seen in culture."
01:21:00;01:21:05;"So we were going to look through that a little bit, starting with some notable celebrities."
01:21:05;01:21:08;"One that caught our eye was Chris Novoselic."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"You know who that is, just by name, Mero?"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"From Nirvana?"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"Yeah, because you're like a big fan, right?"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"I'm an Interpol stan, but I f*** with Nirvana too."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"I'm very, like, 90s alternative."
01:21:19;01:21:23;"Don't worry, Paul Banks hasn't said anything weird."
01:21:23;01:21:29;"I gotta cancel, I gotta delete, turn all the bright lights and s*** out?"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Everything's cool in the Interpol world."
01:21:31;01:21:37;"Even though when you think about it, Interpol is actually a portmanteau for international police."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Yes!"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"When you really break it down."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"Open your third eye!"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"This just really surprised us."
01:21:45;01:21:48;"Maybe just because we hadn't checked in with Chris Novoselic in a while."
01:21:48;01:21:52;"But he went on Facebook after Trump gave his June 1st law and order speech"
01:21:52;01:21:56;"where he threatened to deploy heavily armed soldiers and military personnel."
01:21:56;01:22:00;"And Chris Novoselic wrote, ""Wow, I know many of you can't stand him."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"However, Trump knocked it out of the park with his speech."
01:22:02;01:22:05;"I agree, the president should not be sending troops into states,"
01:22:05;01:22:08;"and he legally might not be able to do so anyway."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Nevertheless, the tone in this speech is strong and direct."""
01:22:11;01:22:15;"And then he said all the violence appears as a leftist insurrection."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"And he said, ""Imagine if so-called patriot militias were raising this kind of hell."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"If this were the case, left-wing people would welcome federal intervention."""
01:22:22;01:22:27;"I mean, first of all, it's so weird that he would take this kind of tone"
01:22:27;01:22:32;"because, like, it'd be one thing if you just found out Chris Novoselic was, like, fully MAGA."
01:22:32;01:22:35;"It's really, like, what's the point of getting out there and being like,"
01:22:35;01:22:39;"""I don't agree that the president should be able to send troops in, but I love his speech."""
01:22:39;01:22:41;"It's, like, such a weird way to frame it."
01:22:41;01:22:45;"Yo, Kirk Coleman is like, ""Who's mans is this?"""
01:22:45;01:22:48;"You know what I'm saying? Like, yo, come on, man."
01:22:48;01:22:51;"Also, remember, there was a concert."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"I don't remember if-- this is a very vivid memory about the name of my brain"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"because it was, like, early on when I first got cable for the first time."
01:22:57;01:23:03;"There was a concert with Nirvana where Chris threw the guitar up in the air"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"and the sh-t hit him directly in the head on the brain."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"-Oh, yeah. -So he might have a TBI."
01:23:07;01:23:11;"He might have a TBI, that's why he's talking all brazy like that."
01:23:11;01:23:15;"People always talk about it with NFL players, they don't talk about it enough with musicians."
01:23:15;01:23:19;"I don't know, like, I've held guitars, like, they're heavy, dawg,"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"and he threw that sh-t real high in the air."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I can picture that immediately when you describe that."
01:23:23;01:23:26;"That's the type of thing that, like, you could almost kill somebody."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"Yeah, but, yeah, that's a bozo response, like, you know what I'm saying? Like, I--"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"Sorry, Chris, I'm trying to spit it for you, but, yeah, that ain't gonna work."
01:23:35;01:23:39;"Well, I found a great quote from him. It says, describing his political views,"
01:23:39;01:23:43;"""I'm an anarcho-capitalist socialist moderate."""
01:23:43;01:23:46;"-Okay. -That's the Tiger Woods, ""I'm your agent."""
01:23:46;01:23:52;"Couldn't be more contradictory. Anarcho-capitalist socialist moderate."
01:23:52;01:23:56;"It's-- That is the biggest, like, jumble of--"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"What the f-ck is that?"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"Wait, Jake, you're probably the biggest Nirvana fan here."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"Back in high school, in college, yeah."
01:24:03;01:24:07;"Yeah, wait, how-- You were, like, what, 15 when Nevermind came out?"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Yeah, 13 or 14, yeah."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"That must have hit you real hard. Oh, yeah, yeah, you'd been 14."
01:24:11;01:24:15;"So I know you're a big fan. I guess one thing that's interesting to me is, like,"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"I'm not trying to, like, stir sh-t, but I've seen it framed by people before"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"that Kurt and Crist, they were, like, best friends, right?"
01:24:22;01:24:26;"'Cause they grew up together in the small, as Kurt Cobain once put it,"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"""redneck town"" in Washington state."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"And that they were best friends, they kind of were always together,"
01:24:32;01:24:37;"and that Dave Grohl, being from the East Coast, being a little bit younger,"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"he was always the odd man out."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"And I have no idea if it's true or just idle gossip."
01:24:41;01:24:44;"Even people trying to, like-- YouTube videos trying to be like,"
01:24:44;01:24:47;"""Oh, yeah, Kurt, like, never really was down with Dave,"" or something."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Are you familiar with this?"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Yeah, I think there was maybe, like, a class thing."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"Like, those guys were from these poor, working-class families"
01:24:54;01:24:58;"in Aberdeen, Washington, and Grohl came from, like, a fairly wealthy family"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"in, like, the D.C. suburbs."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Yeah."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"And so, I don't know if there was, like, really true beef,"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"but maybe there was just, like, an inherent, like, discomfort."
01:25:07;01:25:11;"And also, Dave Grohl was-- he wasn't the original drummer, right?"
01:25:11;01:25:14;"Yeah, yeah, he was, like, the third drummer, I think."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"So he might also have been, like, kind of, like,"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"eternal new guy syndrome?"
01:25:17;01:25:22;"Yeah, no, I think Crist-- Crist, a.k.a. Crisp--"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"I never got a handle on that."
01:25:24;01:25:27;"And Kurt were, like, friends from, like, middle school"
01:25:27;01:25:30;"when they were, like, the two weirdo punk kids"
01:25:30;01:25:34;"in this, like, kind of, like, flannel, redneck, rural Washington town."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"They probably felt like they were in the trenches together"
01:25:37;01:25:40;"being weirdo punk rock dudes in Aberdeen, Washington."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"But one thing I gotta say is people were also saying,"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"""Well, Chris Novoselic's in this weird, vaguely pro-Trump stuff,"""
01:25:46;01:25:49;"or not so vaguely, but then Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters,"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"they put out, like, the Black Square, just, like,"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Black Lives Matter kind of post, and people were like,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"""There you have it, like, two differing schools of thought."""
01:25:55;01:25:57;"I don't know, I don't want to read into it too much,"
01:25:57;01:26:01;"but would Kurt have been more on the Crist line?"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Were they more allied or something?"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"- Ooh, spicy. - I don't know, like,"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"it doesn't fit at all with Kurt's professed values."
01:26:08;01:26:13;"But then it wouldn't have fit at all with Crist's professed values in 1994."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"This is a classic thing of, like, would John Lennon--"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"like, what would have John Lennon thought of Trump?"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"You see people, like, on Twitter being like,"
01:26:20;01:26:23;"""Oh, yeah, he would have loved Trump,"" and I don't understand that."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"Wait, you said-- people say John Lennon would have loved Trump?"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- Absolutely. - Bro."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Maybe just in the sense of, like,"
01:26:29;01:26:33;"old '60s rock stars turned into hypocritical old ass[bleep]"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"I mean, I doubt it."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"I think Kurt was, like, really tight with, like, Michael Stipe"
01:26:37;01:26:42;"and, like, was really into, like, queer, like, trans sort of, like, identities"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"when it was, like, out there in '93."
01:26:44;01:26:47;"Before, it was like, ""Eh, he was wearing dresses on stage or [bleep]."""
01:26:47;01:26:50;"The only thing that I'll say is-- and first of all, rest in peace, Kurt."
01:26:50;01:26:54;"I'm sorry that I even brought your name up because you will always be--"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"I think it was made with the ""Who's Man"" system."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Oh, yeah, no, no. It's Mero."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Yo, it's Mario Kurt. I love you."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"You know what I'm saying? You influence my youth."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Mero brought up the Kurt's ghost, but I will say,"
01:27:05;01:27:09;"when I think of two people who are, you know,"
01:27:09;01:27:14;"often considered very transgressive figures and controversial figures,"
01:27:14;01:27:17;"that people would not have guessed would ever come to anything"
01:27:17;01:27:21;"close to a right-wing stance, two people that come to mind are Kanye West,"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"who apparently is donating money to George Floyd's family,"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"so who knows with Kanye, but that was the thing."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I think that's why people talk about it so much is because, again,"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"I'm not trying to be morbid, but let's say Kanye died when he was 27."
01:27:33;01:27:36;"That timing doesn't work because that's probably before he put out his music."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"- But let's say Kanye died-- - Late bloomer."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"- Let's say Kanye died after-- - The purposes of the conversation."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"- Yeah, no, I feel you. - Yeah."
01:27:41;01:27:45;"Let's say Kanye died after graduation, and then suddenly Trump was in office,"
01:27:45;01:27:49;"and you had somebody being like, ""You know, if Kanye was alive, man,"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"he would like Trump's showmanship. I bet he'd be wearing a MAGA hat."""
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Everybody would be like, ""Shut the f--- up. You-- How dare you?"""
01:27:55;01:27:58;"- ""You made Jesus walks! How dare you?"" - Right."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"And they'd be pulling up the video of him saying,"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"""George Bush doesn't care about black people."""
01:28:02;01:28:04;"And you're like, ""You're telling me this math."""
01:28:04;01:28:07;"Nobody would buy that. And then the other person I think of is Morrissey,"
01:28:07;01:28:11;"who, even though he was always kind of cagey, he was less politically direct"
01:28:11;01:28:15;"than Michael Stipe, you know, Morrissey, before Kurt Cobain,"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"was a very-- like an important figure in like--"
01:28:19;01:28:23;"He absolutely influenced a generation of fans to like"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"think differently about sexuality and stuff."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"I think people would be surprised that now he's got this reputation"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"as a kind of right-wing dude. Although that was starting to--"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"elements of that was poking its head at earlier."
01:28:32;01:28:37;"( music playing )"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Chris Novoselic's always been a fascinating character to me, too,"
01:29:34;01:29:38;"because he's been pretty quiet since the Nirvana years."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"And it's just like, you know, that's the funny thing about like music"
01:29:41;01:29:45;"and stuff, especially that era when selling records used to make a ton of money."
01:29:45;01:29:49;"Like, he basically-- I'm not trying to diss him. He was a great bassist."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"But he happened to grow up in this weird small town with a generational talent,"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"a genius, Kurt Cobain. I'm sure they loved each other,"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"had real brotherhood. They created this band together."
01:29:59;01:30:03;"And then that generational talent genius dude kills himself"
01:30:03;01:30:06;"after barely starting to even have a career."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"They had three years of being big."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"Look at Pearl Jam. They could have been playing stadiums right now."
01:30:11;01:30:15;"But then so suddenly, 1994, it all goes away."
01:30:15;01:30:19;"You barely got started, and now you're sitting on so much money."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"Again, I'm not saying that that affected his politics,"
01:30:22;01:30:26;"but that's just like a weird-ass life to be like a dude in your late 20s,"
01:30:26;01:30:30;"your best friend kills himself, but you also now have an unlimited source"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"of money for the rest of your life, which is weird."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"- That's just a weird life, you know? - Thanks."
01:30:34;01:30:38;"I don't even know how I would move in that scenario."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:30:40;01:30:43;"I know the values that I was raised with or whatever,"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"which is wild because on the last podcast I did,"
01:30:46;01:30:50;"I was just like, ""Yo, if I really said out loud"
01:30:50;01:30:53;"the politics that I was raised under,"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"motherfuckers would get me out of here so fast."""
01:30:56;01:31:00;"They'd be like, ""Oh, he's a socialist demon! Get him out of here!"""
01:31:00;01:31:04;"- You know what I'm saying? - Because your family was so left-wing"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"- coming from the DR? - Right."
01:31:06;01:31:09;"So they're from the part of the Dominican Republic where it's just like,"
01:31:09;01:31:12;"it's black. It is black."
01:31:12;01:31:17;"It's basically like next to-- it is Haiti. It's on the border."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"So there's this guy who not a lot of people know about"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"if they're not Dominican, Jose Francisco Peña Gomez,"
01:31:23;01:31:28;"who is the darkest, dark-skinned dude you could ever see in your life."
01:31:28;01:31:32;"And he was a national hero for my entire family."
01:31:32;01:31:36;"And then he died from pancreatic cancer and hit the fan"
01:31:36;01:31:40;"and it was all fucked up. And now my dad, all he does is complain about politics in the DR."
01:31:40;01:31:44;"So with those values and seeing that,"
01:31:44;01:31:47;"and seeing what's happening now, I almost want to be like,"
01:31:47;01:31:51;"""Yo, it ain't enough."" The way people approach injustice here"
01:31:51;01:31:55;"is not the same way that people approach injustice in other countries,"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"especially developing nations, which kind of makes me sad because it's like,"
01:31:58;01:32:03;"I had this wild-- because I talk to my dad and my uncles all the time"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"and they were in there in the trenches. So it was just like,"
01:32:06;01:32:11;"when the US occupied DR, they were like, ""Nah, fuck that,"" and they took up arms."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"So he's like, ""That's not going to happen in America, dawg."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Black and brown people are not going to take up arms."""
01:32:16;01:32:21;"And even if they do, the guy in office right now is going to massacre them."
01:32:21;01:32:27;"It'll be the worst rebellion or whatever you want to call it in history, I think."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"Because there's so much money invested into the military and stuff like that"
01:32:30;01:32:34;"that the people can't fight the military. That's where we're at."
01:32:34;01:32:39;"So you're saying, with your family history, your parents, your uncles and stuff,"
01:32:39;01:32:43;"you're only one degree of connection away from people who are actually involved in,"
01:32:43;01:32:49;"I guess, true revolutionary arms struggle against the corrupt right-wing government."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Yeah, man."
01:32:51;01:32:55;"We've never seen anything really like that in the US. Will we ever?"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"Not even close. And that's what I'm saying. I don't think we ever will."
01:32:58;01:33:03;"Because of-- and it's a thing. Trump using the military the way he's using it now"
01:33:03;01:33:07;"and using the National Guard the way he's using it now, that's just to quell,"
01:33:07;01:33:10;"""Yo, don't try that shit."" You know what I mean?"
01:33:10;01:33:13;"That's what he's saying with that action. It's like, ""Yo, you better not try that shit."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"I see that shit work over there and over there, it ain't going to work over here."""
01:33:16;01:33:20;"But again, I'm not super well-versed in political [bleep] like that,"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"so I'm like, ""I don't even know."" That's got to be illegal."
01:33:23;01:33:27;"You can't use your own army to suppress your own citizens."
01:33:27;01:33:32;"That sounds all kinds of wrong to me. There's got to be something that's constitutional."
01:33:32;01:33:36;"I'm not an expert in constitutional law, but I'm sure there's something in there"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"that's like, ""You can't use the army to kill motherfuckers that you don't agree with."""
01:33:40;01:33:41;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:33:41;01:33:45;"Although there's long history of sending in the National Guard to deal with riots"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"and protests and stuff."
01:33:47;01:33:50;"Well, so one thing I want to ask you about, Mero, is there's a question that always comes up"
01:33:50;01:33:54;"when there's a big moment of people talking about police brutality."
01:33:54;01:33:58;"And it's an uncomfortable one because in America, obviously,"
01:33:58;01:34:02;"we're sold the kind of binary of Democrats and Republicans,"
01:34:02;01:34:06;"blue state and red state. We're both from New York originally."
01:34:06;01:34:11;"You're from the Bronx. We both know that New York and New York City"
01:34:11;01:34:14;"is considered the most liberal city in America."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"Right. It's the bluest of the blue."
01:34:16;01:34:19;"This is the version of New York that I feel like exists in the media."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"It's like, New York is the most liberal city in the country,"
01:34:22;01:34:26;"maybe tied to San Francisco. It's an arts and cultural center."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"It's a melting pot full of different people."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"Are there some right-wing pockets? Well, yeah, you got Staten Island."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"But that's basically suburbs."
01:34:33;01:34:39;"And then in times like these, you're reminded that the NYPD"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"is one of the most hated police forces in the country."
01:34:42;01:34:46;"Look at Eric Garner. Sometimes the biggest, these international incidents"
01:34:46;01:34:50;"start in New York. So I guess my question to you, as somebody who grew up in New York,"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"and I've heard you tell a lot of stories about your interactions with the cops"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"over the years, is in your experience growing up, did the fact that you were"
01:34:57;01:35:04;"growing up in a Democratic stronghold, blue city, have impact on your dealings"
01:35:04;01:35:08;"with the police? What do you make of that crazy inconsistency?"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. It's funny because people paint it that way,"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"but it's just like, bruh, it's a lot of talking. It's a lot of rhetoric."
01:35:14;01:35:18;"It's a lot of bullsh*t. Like, yeah, New York is super liberal, and the cops"
01:35:18;01:35:24;"are super nice, and this act the third. If you live below 96th Street"
01:35:24;01:35:29;"or some sh*t like that, or now, it's creeping up. So maybe now below 125th"
01:35:29;01:35:35;"or 110th or whatever. But the f*cking juxtaposition of seeing cops handing out"
01:35:35;01:35:39;"face masks to motherf*ckers sunbathing in Central Park, and then body slamming"
01:35:39;01:35:44;"a dude in the Bronx on the floor for not wearing a face mask, those are two"
01:35:44;01:35:46;"different New Yorks. That's why I tell people all the time, like, yo, the New York"
01:35:46;01:35:51;"that you see on Sex and the City and all these shows, that's not New York."
01:35:51;01:35:55;"Every interaction that I've ever had in my entire life with a cop has been negative."
01:35:55;01:36:00;"And even when it wasn't crime-related or anything, it was beyond stop and frisk,"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"because that's like, I'll be on here for six hours talking about all the times"
01:36:02;01:36:08;"I got stopped and frisked. But even in something as simple as a car accident,"
01:36:08;01:36:13;"so like something in a situation where I'm pulling out of a parking spot,"
01:36:13;01:36:17;"I got my blinker on, I'm totally in the right, and there's somebody coming down"
01:36:17;01:36:22;"the street doing like 70 miles an hour on a local street, wiling. So when I'm"
01:36:22;01:36:26;"making my turn, I get clipped. Now you got to call the police, because my bumper's"
01:36:26;01:36:29;"hanging off, this lady's bumper's hanging off, you know what I'm saying?"
01:36:29;01:36:32;"There's an Italian lady with coke on her nose and sh*t, like, and I'm just like,"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"""Yo, you f*cked up? Are you skied up right now?"" She's like, ""What are you"
01:36:35;01:36:40;"talking about? Call the cops."" So the cops come, and I just like, ""Yo, this is"
01:36:40;01:36:44;"what happened. I was pulling out. I live right here across the street, blah, blah,"
01:36:44;01:36:48;"blah, blah, blah."" And then I extend my hand as like a, ""Yo,"" you know what I"
01:36:48;01:36:52;"mean? Like, ""You got gloves on, dog. I know you're not afraid of germs. I'm just"
01:36:52;01:36:56;"trying to shake your hand and be like, 'Yo, my car is f*cked up. Her car is f*cked"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"up. It's over here.'"" And it's just like a traffic incident. But the dude was just"
01:36:59;01:37:03;"wild callous. And when I reached out to shake his hand, he's like, verbatim, he's"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"like, ""Don't touch me."" And he's like, ""What the f*ck is going on here?"" Like"
01:37:06;01:37:10;"that. I was like, ""Yo, this lady hit my car. I'm in a parking spot. She's skied"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"up."" Like, why don't you worry about her? You know what I mean?"
01:37:13;01:37:16;"-Wait, when, like, was this recently? -This was a couple years ago, but recent"
01:37:16;01:37:20;"enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, and even more recently, like, I'm on the"
01:37:20;01:37:25;"highway, and I'm switching lanes, you know what I mean? Like, in Jersey, mind"
01:37:25;01:37:28;"you. Like, I'm switching lanes, but I got my blinker on, and everything's"
01:37:28;01:37:34;"opposite. The speed limit is 65. I'm doing 75, and I get pulled over. The guy's"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"like, ""Yo, you're going 10 miles over the speed limit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
01:37:36;01:37:41;"blah, blah, blah."" I said, ""But in driving school, they teach you, you know, stay"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"10 under, 10 over. Like, that's cool. You know what I mean? Keep up with the flow"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"of traffic."" Because there's been other times when I've been pulled over for"
01:37:47;01:37:51;"going, literally for going to speed limit. And they're like, ""Yo, that looks"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"suspicious."" -Because the other cars were going faster?"
01:37:54;01:37:59;"-Yeah, you're doing 48 in a 50. I'm like, ""What?"" You know what I'm saying? So,"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"it's just like, I've literally never had a positive experience with police. It's"
01:38:02;01:38:06;"wild. And I thought that was normal. You know what I mean? Like, growing up and"
01:38:06;01:38:10;"like, being insulated in the Bronx like that, like, now I'm just like, and shout"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"out to you for bringing me out to Cali for the first time. -Oh, yeah."
01:38:13;01:38:16;"-Now I'm just like, exploring the world. Because before, it was the Bronx and"
01:38:16;01:38:20;"Dominican Republic. That was my world. You know what I mean? And like, as getting"
01:38:20;01:38:24;"involved in like, you know, media and TV and sh*t like that, and entertainment,"
01:38:24;01:38:29;"it's given me more room to move around the country and see different sh*t and"
01:38:29;01:38:32;"talk to different people. And when I tell somebody, ""Yo, I was coming out of my"
01:38:32;01:38:36;"crib to go to the bodega that's literally around the corner and I got stopped by"
01:38:36;01:38:41;"the police."" They come down the wrong way, down a one-way street, just to jump out"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"of a car and throw me up against the wall. And all I was doing was going to the"
01:38:43;01:38:47;"store. So, I'm just like, ""Yo, what, like, what are you doing?"" And they're like,"
01:38:47;01:38:50;"""Yo, do you live here?"" I'm like, ""Yeah, I live here."" I'm like, ""My girlfriend"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"lives here, my mother lives here, this is where I stay."" But then they checked my"
01:38:53;01:38:57;"license, and my license had a different address on it. So now I had to walk this"
01:38:57;01:39:02;"dude to my ex-girlfriend's door to knock on the door to verify that I lived there."
01:39:02;01:39:06;"-I think it's like, important for people who haven't heard these types of stories"
01:39:06;01:39:10;"or been, obviously, lived them. I think something happens too in these incidents"
01:39:10;01:39:14;"where you see a cop literally kill somebody. That's too far for a lot of"
01:39:14;01:39:18;"people. And then a lot of people start talking about, ""Well, yeah, we got to"
01:39:18;01:39:22;"train cops not to kill somebody."" And of course, that's true. But then I'm always"
01:39:22;01:39:27;"curious about, like, stories like this, it's low-level compared to death, but it's"
01:39:27;01:39:32;"the type of thing that, day in, day out, absolutely, deeply affects the fabric of"
01:39:32;01:39:35;"somebody's life. So this story that you're telling, how old were you?"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"-Like, 17, 18?"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"-And that was like a common enough thing, is like, literally getting thrown"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"against the wall for absolutely nothing."
01:39:41;01:39:45;"-Man, forget about it. When I was-- yo, and like, when I was a teenager, even."
01:39:45;01:39:48;"Like, when I was a teenager, just riding around the city in the train, [bleep] like"
01:39:48;01:39:52;"that, doing my little graffiti thing, whatever. Like, in the '90s, they wouldn't"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"even arrest you, they would just [bleep] you up or, like, do some foul [bleep]."
01:39:55;01:40:00;"They caught me catching a tag one time and instead of taking me in, booking me,"
01:40:00;01:40:04;"handcuffing me, all that [bleep] they bopped me in the head with the spray can,"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"sprayed the [bleep] in my face and then sprayed the [bleep] all over my shoes."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"-They spray painted your face?"
01:40:09;01:40:13;"-Yeah. So that's the type of [bleep] like, you know what I mean? And in my head,"
01:40:13;01:40:16;"I'm like, yo, at least I didn't go to jail. But at the same time, I'm like, yo,"
01:40:16;01:40:21;"that's not cool. Where in the rule book is that? And I had no-- I didn't have no,"
01:40:21;01:40:26;"like, yo, let me get your badge number, you know what I mean? Or any type of, like,"
01:40:26;01:40:30;"recourse, you know what I mean? Like, there was no-- it was, yo, it is what it is."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"I thought that was normal, you know what I'm saying? And then when you talk to"
01:40:32;01:40:36;"other people and you expand your horizons and [bleep] they're like, ah, fam, that"
01:40:36;01:40:40;"is not normal at all. Like, that's not what cops are supposed to do."
01:40:40;01:40:44;"-The stories that always cause, like, the big protests and stuff and the types that"
01:40:44;01:40:48;"are finally going to get across the-- in front of the eyes of, like, you know, your"
01:40:48;01:40:52;"average suburban white middle class person, they're usually going to be more"
01:40:52;01:40:55;"extreme because they're going to involve death or something. And then one of the"
01:40:55;01:40:59;"arguments you always make is, well, they did break the law. And then these stories"
01:40:59;01:41:04;"where somebody was literally doing nothing, those are the ones that are, I think--"
01:41:04;01:41:08;"-Like, Breonna Taylor, man. Like, literally, like, in her own crib."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"-In her own home, yeah. -Like, that's wild, bro. Like, you know what"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"I mean? And, like, people talk about, yo, let's reform, let's reform. That's like"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"me taking a rotten apple out of the fridge and being like, yo, I'm going to reform"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"this apple, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm going to try to cut the [bleep]"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"parts out, you know what I mean? All I'm going to be left with is, like, a leaf or"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"a stem or some [bleep] Maybe I'm being pessimistic, you know what I'm saying?"
01:41:25;01:41:28;"-Right. -Or maybe I'm being realist. I don't know."
01:41:28;01:41:40;"I had a dream we kissed and it was all amethyst The under part of your eyes was violet"
01:41:40;01:41:46;"You hung a cigarette between your purple lips"
01:41:50;01:42:00;"We've been best buds since 13 I hold your hat back when you're too lean"
01:42:00;01:42:07;"I hold the Taco Bell and you cry over Eugene, he was mean"
01:42:07;01:42:11;"-Another thing that really, like, I think is so disturbing about this moment is that,"
01:42:11;01:42:17;"yes, we have probably the worst president of all time, absolutely one of the, like,"
01:42:17;01:42:22;"most chaotic, and, you know, you see a lot of this energy of people being like,"
01:42:22;01:42:26;"when talking about the police brutality and saying, ""This is why we got to vote Trump out,"""
01:42:26;01:42:31;"I agree, we got to vote Trump out, but then you sometimes get that sick feeling where"
01:42:31;01:42:36;"even me, as somebody who's never had been messed with by the cops, just as somebody"
01:42:36;01:42:41;"vaguely paying attention, I think back to, like, well, in my lifetime, I've had about"
01:42:41;01:42:47;"almost equal Republican presidents and Democrat presidents. So I'm curious, were there ever"
01:42:47;01:42:51;"notable changes in your lifetime where you were like, ""There was a reform, something"
01:42:51;01:42:54;"did change for a second,"" or something got worse?"
01:42:54;01:42:58;"-No, no, no, no, no. I got older, that's the only thing that happened. I got older and"
01:42:58;01:43:02;"I started reading and I started saying, like, ""Yo, you can't take me out the car."" I didn't"
01:43:02;01:43:05;"do anything wrong, you know what I mean? I started, like, standing up for myself. And"
01:43:05;01:43:11;"regardless, like, yo, the thing is that, like, in particular, NYPD, they got the mayor"
01:43:11;01:43:16;"on smash. It don't matter who the mayor is. They got him on smash. The police union, the"
01:43:16;01:43:21;"police chief, whoever the f*** it is, like, they got whoever the mayor-- it could be"
01:43:21;01:43:24;"motherf***er Malcolm X could be the mayor of New York City, and they would have that"
01:43:24;01:43:28;"motherf***er on the front. That thin blue line s*** is real. Like, those dudes don't"
01:43:28;01:43:32;"give a f***. Like, there ain't no such thing as like, ""Yo, I'm not going to speak for"
01:43:32;01:43:35;"all police."" You know what I'm saying? Because there's, like-- I guess there's, like, a handful"
01:43:35;01:43:40;"out there that are like, ""Yo, that's not me. More power to you."" But if you're not saying,"
01:43:40;01:43:45;"""My man, what the f*** are you doing?"" Like, there was a thing where that got leaked over"
01:43:45;01:43:51;"the NYPD scanner where a cop was calling in, like, you know, there was a protest and they"
01:43:51;01:43:55;"were, like, blocked in. All they had to do was put the car in park and just chill. And"
01:43:55;01:43:58;"you still on the clock, you're still getting paid. You know what I'm saying? Like, you"
01:43:58;01:44:02;"don't get paid per arrest. It's not a commission thing. But he calls it in, boom, yadadada,"
01:44:02;01:44:06;"and then two other cops come on the horn, ""Run the motherf***er. Shoot the motherf***er."""
01:44:06;01:44:09;"And then the other dude comes on and says-- I guess the commanding officer says, ""Don't"
01:44:09;01:44:14;"say that over the air."" Instead of saying, like, ""Yo, who the f*** are you? Turn your"
01:44:14;01:44:17;"badge and your gun in right now. Yo, report back to base or precinct, whatever the f***"
01:44:17;01:44:21;"they call it, and you're done."" You can't say s*** like that. You can't even think s***"
01:44:21;01:44:24;"like that. That's the thing, though. Like, because there's people that are like, ""Yo,"
01:44:24;01:44:27;"let's abolish the police completely, and I'm with that."" Then there's people that's like,"
01:44:27;01:44:32;"""Yo, let's reform the police, and I'm not with that."" And I don't know what completely"
01:44:32;01:44:37;"abolishing policing means. As a Black person, I'm not sure what that means. Somebody put"
01:44:37;01:44:43;"forth some type of, like, plan for me to digest and understand what that means. Because it's"
01:44:43;01:44:49;"like, yo, like I said, I've never had a positive interaction with police. But, like, fam, if,"
01:44:49;01:44:53;"like, somebody runs down on my sister, I want to find out what happened. You know what I"
01:44:53;01:44:57;"mean? And, like, unfortunately, that's the resource that you have is the police in a"
01:44:57;01:44:58;"scenario like that."
01:44:58;01:45:01;"Yeah, that's what we were just talking about with Alex Vitale, too, is, like, the choice"
01:45:01;01:45:06;"shouldn't be between having police or living in anarchy. Because if you're the one trying"
01:45:06;01:45:10;"to be like, ""No, we don't need anything,"" you're always going to lose the debate. Because"
01:45:10;01:45:16;"people, everybody, wants to feel safe. That's, like, a basic human right. If you're trying"
01:45:16;01:45:20;"to be, like, on the right wing and saying, ""We need law and order,"" and the left wing"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"is saying, ""We don't need anything,"" of course that's not going to work. But that's not what"
01:45:23;01:45:29;"most people are saying. They're saying that there are problems to be solved. We need authorities"
01:45:29;01:45:32;"that can help us figure out stuff. Something bad happens to somebody in your family. Something"
01:45:32;01:45:36;"bad happens to you. We need those problems to be solved. It's just how? Who do you go"
01:45:36;01:45:40;"to? And is it somebody with a gun? And what department are they from? And how do they"
01:45:40;01:45:45;"work? And what, you know, what are the channels of justice? We still need justice. That's"
01:45:45;01:45:49;"the messed up part is that policing kind of seems like the only way to get justice. And"
01:45:49;01:45:53;"we're also talking about, like, I'm sure there's a lot of cops who go into the force wanting"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"to help people. I believe that. I'm not such a pessimist that I believe that millions and"
01:45:57;01:46:02;"millions of cops only join the force to beat people up. I don't have such a dark view of"
01:46:02;01:46:08;"humanity or police, but I do know that some combination of policing plus the laws creates"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"something very, very dark."
01:46:10;01:46:15;"And to me, like, it could be as simple as just like, ""Yo, defund police and allocate"
01:46:15;01:46:20;"those funds elsewhere."" So, like, if you got issues like domestic violence issues, there's"
01:46:20;01:46:24;"been so many times, like, I lived in buildings and apartment buildings or whatever where"
01:46:24;01:46:30;"there's domestic violence, cops show up, they don't really do nothing, and then they leave."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"And then whoever's getting abused continues to get abused, you know what I mean? Until"
01:46:34;01:46:39;"somebody from the community steps in or something like that. So, like, community policing is"
01:46:39;01:46:45;"one thing, but it's like, is that, that's not like 100% feel safe, you know what I mean?"
01:46:45;01:46:50;"But, like, you can take that situation, like a domestic violence situation, and have it"
01:46:50;01:46:56;"be handled by social services, you know what I mean? Like, something different. Like, I"
01:46:56;01:47:01;"don't even know what it is yet, but like, not just a dude showing up with a gun, like,"
01:47:01;01:47:05;"""Yo, get out, open the f***ing door, get on the ground, give me your f***ing ID, ahhh!"""
01:47:05;01:47:07;"It's like f***ing aggressive energy."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"And it's not easy, and I'm sure a lot of people are probably saying, ""Well, social"
01:47:10;01:47:14;"work needs to be reformed too."" I'm sure there's all sorts of problems in that world"
01:47:14;01:47:19;"too. Well, the thing that differentiates police from every other job is use of force."
01:47:19;01:47:23;"You know, people make a lot of jokes about like, ""Well, if I killed someone in my job,"
01:47:23;01:47:28;"I think I'd be in a little more trouble than like two weeks, you know, paid suspension."""
01:47:28;01:47:32;"And people write about that, but they gotta understand that that's not just like some"
01:47:32;01:47:37;"weird coincidence. There literally are laws in most states that protect police because"
01:47:37;01:47:42;"they say your job involves the use of force, and your job is fundamentally different than"
01:47:42;01:47:47;"other people's jobs. So, I hope that that can be changed, but in the meantime, yeah,"
01:47:47;01:47:51;"how about trying to solve more problems with people whose job doesn't include the use"
01:47:51;01:47:56;"of force? Because if you heard about a social worker sitting down with somebody to talk"
01:47:56;01:47:59;"about their problem in the office, and next thing you know, they're like hitting them"
01:47:59;01:48:04;"or had their knee on their neck, that person would be fired because it has nothing to do"
01:48:04;01:48:09;"with the job. Immediately. But obviously, that's going to take a minute to happen."
01:48:09;01:48:15;"In the meantime, how do you feel, Mero, when you see brands making statements about Black"
01:48:15;01:48:20;"Lives Matter and police brutality? Does it warm your heart at all? Are you suspicious?"
01:48:20;01:48:26;"It's like, are you saying it just because you have to? Because now, working in entertainment,"
01:48:26;01:48:32;"like seeing PR firms and shit like that, I know the game now. So, it's just like, you"
01:48:32;01:48:37;"can't just bamboozle me, Downey, or say no shot to Downey. You know what I'm saying?"
01:48:37;01:48:42;"I don't know if Downey made it. Wait, Seinfeld, can you check if Downey made a statement?"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"Yeah, I'll look into it."
01:48:43;01:48:47;"Yeah, let's see if Downey, because Downey had the cute bear, Snuggles, is that what"
01:48:47;01:48:48;"he was called?"
01:48:48;01:48:49;"The bear, yeah."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Yeah, the Snuggle bear."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Snuggle's been a little bit too quiet for my taste."
01:48:52;01:48:56;"You know what I'm saying? I want to know how my fabric softener feels about this crisis."
01:48:56;01:49:01;"That's the dumb shit. It's like, okay, I understand what you're trying to do, but it's just so"
01:49:01;01:49:10;"goofy. I feel like most of these slogans and initiatives or whatever that are thought up"
01:49:10;01:49:14;"in these boardrooms are just goofy. When you can just go out and just talk to the people"
01:49:14;01:49:18;"and be like, ""Yo, what do you need? How can we do better?"" You know what I mean? Just"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"get on the ground, bro."
01:49:19;01:49:23;"Downey did make a statement a couple days ago."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"Yeah, what did they say? They don't want to be soft."
01:49:26;01:49:33;"They said, ""Equality, justice, action now. We stand with those fighting for equality"
01:49:33;01:49:41;"and #justice. We're joining the Procter & Gamble family of brands to commit $5 million to #TakeOnRace,"
01:49:41;01:49:47;"a fund supporting organizations fighting systemic bias and inequality."" And then they have"
01:49:47;01:49:52;"a very solemn four-panel thing that says, ""Equality, justice, action now."""
01:49:52;01:49:53;"No bear?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"Yeah, was the bear?"
01:49:54;01:49:59;"No snuggle. No snuggle with the raised fist."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"There you go, brown erasure. Brown erasure."
01:50:02;01:50:08;"Yeah, they wouldn't let snuggle get back in. I mean, when you talked about the millions"
01:50:08;01:50:12;"of dollars that Procter & Gamble's giving, $5 million from Downey, that'd be significant."
01:50:12;01:50:16;"From the whole Procter & Gamble family, that's a drop in the bucket. But before that, it"
01:50:16;01:50:20;"was all kind of like, ""Eh."" It's a weird feeling when you see so many people on the"
01:50:20;01:50:25;"internet talking about taking action. We've all had this experience where you know you're"
01:50:25;01:50:29;"in the hall of mirrors where everybody's, especially white people, calling each other"
01:50:29;01:50:34;"out saying, ""We need to take more action, and we need to talk about taking more action."""
01:50:34;01:50:37;"It's like, ""I agree. We absolutely need to take more action, and the first step to"
01:50:37;01:50:42;"taking action is listening."" And you're like, you just know that it's all just talking"
01:50:42;01:50:47;"about taking action. It's no action. And again, I'm a little bit on some Anne Frank"
01:50:47;01:50:52;"shit. I do believe that there's good in all people. Let's say most people. I do believe"
01:50:52;01:50:58;"it. But I also believe that the world is so chaotic and confusing that well-meaning people"
01:50:58;01:51:03;"do the opposite of what they think they're doing every day. I think there's all sorts"
01:51:03;01:51:08;"of people who mean well, white people calling each other out and talking about action. They"
01:51:08;01:51:13;"mean well, but they just don't know what real action would be because very few people do."
01:51:13;01:51:17;"There's something like really, even now we're talking about there's all these responses"
01:51:17;01:51:22;"that, ""Well, how do you reform the police?"" And clearly some ideas are better than others,"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"but we don't know which one's going to win. But anyway, I'm curious about when you hear"
01:51:25;01:51:32;"this language of like Downy Fabric Softener, even just saying that is just like unreal."
01:51:32;01:51:37;"That was a good call, Mero. What does Downy have to say? But even Downy Fabric Softener"
01:51:37;01:51:41;"talking about action and justice, I'm willing to believe there's many people in the Downy"
01:51:41;01:51:47;"organization who don't believe that black people should be treated as subhumans and"
01:51:47;01:51:52;"brutalized by the police. I believe that there's people in the Downy organization believe that"
01:51:52;01:51:57;"in this money, I believe that there's some good behind it. It's also a gigantic tax write-off."
01:51:57;01:52:04;"Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. It's PR and a tax write-off. I'm kind of pessimistic,"
01:52:04;01:52:08;"but not so much. Obviously, there has to be good people in the world or else we would"
01:52:08;01:52:12;"all be dead. You know what I'm saying? You know who did, I'm not going to go out front,"
01:52:12;01:52:16;"I read one, I think it was Ben and Jerry's. They did a read."
01:52:16;01:52:20;"We were going to talk about them. This is the actual text. ""The murder of George Floyd"
01:52:20;01:52:24;"was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white"
01:52:24;01:52:29;"supremacy."" And they include an image that said, ""We must dismantle white supremacy."""
01:52:29;01:52:34;"Now, I do love Ben and Jerry's. We got to talk about the Chunky Dunkys at some point."
01:52:34;01:52:38;"But it's a really big month for Ben and Jerry's."
01:52:38;01:52:40;"The worst sneaker of the year."
01:52:40;01:52:44;"Well, it's the hottest sneaker of the year too. But Ben and Jerry's, first of all, I've"
01:52:44;01:52:49;"met Ben and Jerry when we were doing some campaigning for Bernie. So I'll always respect"
01:52:49;01:52:55;"Ben and Jerry because I can't think of too many other people like that. People made a"
01:52:55;01:53:00;"lot of money with a corporate product or out there campaigning for Bernie Sanders. So I"
01:53:00;01:53:05;"respect them. I know that they don't fully control the company anymore. And I know they"
01:53:05;01:53:09;"come from Burlington, Vermont. Crunchy, left-wing background. I like all that."
01:53:09;01:53:14;"The only thing I'll say though is like, okay, here's my pessimistic take. And then I hope"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"someone can convince me not to be this pessimistic."
01:53:16;01:53:17;"Let's go."
01:53:17;01:53:23;"The idea that Downey Fabric Softener would be putting out a statement that says, ""We"
01:53:23;01:53:30;"need to tackle racial inequality and we need racial justice in this country."" Imagine if"
01:53:30;01:53:35;"somebody told you that in the eighties. You're just watching Snuggles the Bear on a commercial"
01:53:35;01:53:39;"just trying to... And then you're like, ""You know what? In the future, one day, this same"
01:53:39;01:53:45;"company that right now is just like a bear going, 'It's so soft!' One day, this company,"
01:53:45;01:53:51;"they'll be making a statement on the social media platform about ending racism."" You'd"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"be like, ""Uh, doubt it."""
01:53:53;01:53:54;"What?"
01:53:54;01:53:59;"Because at that moment, for a fabric softener to even talk about racism would have been"
01:53:59;01:54:05;"seen as kind of crazy, controversial, whatever, 30 years ago. So my fear is that there's something"
01:54:05;01:54:11;"about the language of marketing and social media that... It's like the same way that"
01:54:11;01:54:18;"people say that capitalism can absorb any critique of it. One day, Che Guevara's fighting capitalism."
01:54:18;01:54:22;"Next day, he's being sold on a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters. This is... Tale as old as"
01:54:22;01:54:27;"time. I guess sometimes my pessimistic side is like, ""Well, yeah, Ben & Jerry's is ahead"
01:54:27;01:54:33;"of the curve because it's a cooler company, but maybe in another 10 years, nothing will"
01:54:33;01:54:38;"change. But in 10 years, you might get..."" Now, Downey is going to be tweeting about"
01:54:38;01:54:42;"using the phrase ""white supremacy"" and Ben & Jerry's will be full on just writing, ""F***"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"the police."" You know what I mean?"
01:54:44;01:54:49;"Like, ""Yo, nothing for you."" And that's a take that I have not heard and that makes"
01:54:49;01:54:54;"perfect sense. It's 1 million percent logical. And like, ""Yo, it's marketing."" It might've"
01:54:54;01:54:58;"been them sitting back and being like, ""All right, let's wait and see what everybody else"
01:54:58;01:55:02;"says and everybody else's reactions to this s***,"" right? And then they see that everybody"
01:55:02;01:55:10;"else, like Downey and whoever else is using soft language, no pun intended, like ""injustice,"""
01:55:10;01:55:13;"you know what I mean? Instead of saying like, ""Yo, black lives matter. White supremacy,"""
01:55:13;01:55:16;"you know what I mean? Like, that's the thing. You might be ahead of the curve right now"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"because you might've... Like, they might've had their people sitting in the back room"
01:55:19;01:55:23;"being like, ""Yo, hold on. Chill, chill, chill. Before we release our statements, let's let"
01:55:23;01:55:27;"these motherf***ers release their statements first and let's see what the reaction is before"
01:55:27;01:55:33;"we release ours."" A lot of the blowback was like, ""Yo, it's white supremacy. Say 'black"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"lives matter,' say this, use this language."""
01:55:35;01:55:40;"- I know. And that's the tough thing is like, people mean well when they criticize corporate"
01:55:40;01:55:45;"language and social media language by saying, ""Say the word,"" you know? Like, talking about"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"it for real. But..."
01:55:46;01:55:50;"- Bro, chill, I don't want to cut you off, but you really said, ""Ben & Jerry's say f***"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"the police."""
01:55:51;01:55:54;"- I mean, that's almost just too dark, but it's like..."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"- I'm not making a f***ing statement. I'm making my own special flavor."
01:55:57;01:56:01;"- I was saying before, just like... Well, no, I feel like actually there was... Wasn't"
01:56:01;01:56:04;"there a viral tweet where somebody... No, no, actually, now that I think about it, there"
01:56:04;01:56:09;"was a tweet where somebody literally was being like, ""All these other brands are being soft."
01:56:09;01:56:13;"Ben & Jerry's, meanwhile, is basically like, 'F*** the police. That is our new flavor and"
01:56:13;01:56:17;"has blueberries.'"" That was a viral tweet, actually. Obviously, it's funny, but it's"
01:56:17;01:56:21;"like, they're almost giving them too much credit, you know? And again, I like Ben & Jerry's"
01:56:21;01:56:26;"as a company, but when you're one step ahead, it's like with fashion or music, all you have"
01:56:26;01:56:30;"to be is one step ahead, and suddenly you seem like the crazy visionary, but it doesn't"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"mean that you're... It's all relative, right?"
01:56:32;01:56:33;"- Yeah."
01:56:33;01:56:37;"- Although, the one thing I'll say is I do kind of... Now that I'm talking about this,"
01:56:37;01:56:43;"I kind of remember Ben & Jerry's actually posting something a while back about why weed"
01:56:43;01:56:48;"should be legal and why it's so messed up that black people are targeted for weed possession."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"Didn't they do something like that?"
01:56:50;01:56:55;"- They had a blog post called ""Let's Be Blunt About Cannabis."" That was actually on 4/20"
01:56:55;01:56:56;"of this year."
01:56:56;01:57:00;"- And if Ben & Jerry's is actually giving money towards legalizing weed or something,"
01:57:00;01:57:06;"that's light years ahead of brands who are just trying to have conversations and are"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"doing it."
01:57:07;01:57:11;"- Yeah, our executive board sat down with some activists to chat. If you're actually"
01:57:11;01:57:14;"being like, ""We're not just talking about the problem. We're trying to get to the bottom"
01:57:14;01:57:18;"of it, and we're looking at..."" We were talking about this a lot earlier in the show, Mero,"
01:57:18;01:57:24;"is just the extent to which the war on drugs is so obviously linked to policing and police"
01:57:24;01:57:29;"brutality, and yet there's still this tendency to talk about them as two separate things"
01:57:29;01:57:33;"where it's kind of like, ""Well, I don't know if I think weed should be... If we should"
01:57:33;01:57:36;"just call it as drugs, but I do think cops should chill out."" And you're just kind of"
01:57:36;01:57:39;"like, ""There's a lot of cops. There's always going to be an unchill cop."" Well, actually,"
01:57:39;01:57:43;"I'm curious, in your own experience, what was the link between times when you were just"
01:57:43;01:57:49;"randomly harassed? How many times did it have to do with the ""search for illegal drugs""?"
01:57:49;01:57:55;"- Oh, with me, it was always drugs and guns. Weirdly, any time I got pulled over under"
01:57:55;01:58:00;"an elevated train, like the 4 train and 6 train, 5, 2, 5, any time I got pulled over"
01:58:00;01:58:05;"under one of those trains, they would always pull me over and be like, ""Yo, make up a bulls***"
01:58:05;01:58:10;"reason,"" and then toss my car and be like, ""All right."" First, they would ask me straight"
01:58:10;01:58:14;"up, like, ""Yo, do you have a gun on you?"" And I'd be like, ""No. Why would I be driving"
01:58:14;01:58:17;"around 2 o'clock in the afternoon with a gun on me? I'm coming home from work."""
01:58:17;01:58:21;"- Just to be totally clear, in these situations, there wasn't some pretext where it's like,"
01:58:21;01:58:24;"""You made a weird turn there. Step out. Let me take a look."" It's literally just,"
01:58:24;01:58:27;"""I stopped you. Why?"" I just wanted to see if you had a gun."
01:58:27;01:58:31;"- Straight up. Like, ""Yo."" And again, it's one of those things where it was just like,"
01:58:31;01:58:36;"""Yo, hold up. Are you supposed to be doing this? Is this legal? Can you just stop me"
01:58:36;01:58:39;"and pull me out of my car?"" And back in the day, I thought it was, ""Yo, that's what it"
01:58:39;01:58:45;"is."" Straight back cornrow, gold fronts, marrow, thought that cops just do whatever"
01:58:45;01:58:46;"the f*** they want."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"- What's the most arbitrary thing you ever got arrested for?"
01:58:48;01:58:53;"- Deft of service for getting on the back of the bus with a MetroCard, with full intent"
01:58:53;01:58:58;"to pay my fare. But the line at the front of the bus was so long, and I was late, that"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"I just got on the back of the bus just to get the bus, just so I wouldn't miss the bus."
01:59:01;01:59:02;"- Yeah."
01:59:02;01:59:06;"- So I got on the back of the bus, started walking towards the front. A cop stops the"
01:59:06;01:59:11;"bus, and this was on Burnside, shot the Burnside, and I was getting on a 40 bus. I got on the"
01:59:11;01:59:15;"back of the 40 bus, I started walking towards the front with my MetroCard out invisible."
01:59:15;01:59:20;"And you know your MetroCards are yellow as f***. Like, you can't mistake a MetroCard"
01:59:20;01:59:21;"for anything but a MetroCard."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"- That's right."
01:59:22;01:59:26;"- I'm walking to the front of the bus, this mother f***er stops the bus, yanks me off"
01:59:26;01:59:29;"the bus. I was like, ""Yo, I'm going to pay my fare."" He's like, ""No, you weren't."" Gets"
01:59:29;01:59:32;"on the horn, we had a TOS, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada."
01:59:32;01:59:34;"- Wait, wait, sorry. What does TOS stand for?"
01:59:34;01:59:37;"- Deft of service. So like, hopping a train, hopping a bus."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"- You stole a ride."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- I stole a ride."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"- You stole a ride."
01:59:40;01:59:46;"- Yeah. So I stole a $1.50 ride. So you had to pull me out of the bus, inconvenience the"
01:59:46;01:59:49;"entire bus full of people, because you know what I'm saying? This was Burnside and Jerome"
01:59:49;01:59:53;"Avenue. Everybody there's working class, there's no rich people over there. So you inconvenience"
01:59:53;01:59:58;"this whole bus full of people going to school, work, wherever the f*** they were going, just"
01:59:58;02:00:02;"to pull me off. I have money on my MetroCard. I'm telling you that I'm paying my, that I'm"
02:00:02;02:00:05;"going to go pay my fare. But regardless of that, you just want to hand me up, throw me"
02:00:05;02:00:08;"up against the gate, f*** up my white tee, because he threw me up against the rolled"
02:00:08;02:00:12;"down gate that was all dusty and dirty, and f***ed my whole day up. Took me in, booked"
02:00:12;02:00:16;"me, and I didn't even, they didn't even book me. They took me to the precinct and just"
02:00:16;02:00:20;"had me sit there like an a**hole. You know what I'm saying? And I guess they realized"
02:00:20;02:00:24;"like, yo, there's no, I don't want to do paperwork or I don't want to do whatever the f***. And"
02:00:24;02:00:28;"they're like, yo, get the f*** out of here. It's wild, bro. It's very loosey goosey, like"
02:00:28;02:00:29;"how they do s***."
02:00:29;02:00:34;"- These are the type of stories that you sometimes get worried about. For the type of people"
02:00:34;02:00:42;"who only get off the couch for police brutality, like police murder, so to speak, a story like"
02:00:42;02:00:43;"yours-"
02:00:43;02:00:44;"- They're like, ah, whatever."
02:00:44;02:00:48;"- Well, it's also just like, that kind of stuff is happening every day. And also just"
02:00:48;02:00:53;"like the idea that, you know, that the cop is even in charge of that. Like the same cop"
02:00:53;02:00:59;"who's like maybe dealing with theft and murder is also in charge of making sure that a kid"
02:00:59;02:01:05;"pays their, swipes their card. Like, you know, you could even hire, put somebody on the street"
02:01:05;02:01:10;"at the same salary and be like, hey, if you ever see somebody, give them a ticket."
02:01:10;02:01:15;"- And that's the thing too, like now I have the knowledge to know like, fam, you're not"
02:01:15;02:01:19;"supposed to take the entrance. You're supposed to write me a DAT, a desk appearance ticket"
02:01:19;02:01:22;"and keep it moving. You know what I mean? Cause you're supposed to be, like you said,"
02:01:22;02:01:26;"fighting real crime. Like, you know what I mean? Like if some motherf***er getting stabbed"
02:01:26;02:01:30;"to death down the street and you over here wasting your time with me, writing me a ticket"
02:01:30;02:01:34;"and asking me my address and all this bulls*** cause I got on the back of the bus instead"
02:01:34;02:01:37;"of the front of the bus, that whole system is f***ed up."
02:01:37;02:01:41;"- Yeah, it's dark, but I mean, people are paying attention. So maybe people will finally"
02:01:41;02:01:45;"pay attention to some of the underlying issues."
02:01:45;02:01:49;"- Yeah, but you know what? Shout out to Downy."
02:01:49;02:01:52;"- Well, we got Downy on the case. That's a good one. And shout out to Ben and Jerry's."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"You like Ben and Jerry's?"
02:01:54;02:01:58;"- Like I'm highly lactose intolerant, so I punish my intestines every time I do it, but"
02:01:58;02:02:03;"I f*** with it hard, bro. Like that fish food, woo, that s*** is different. And now they're"
02:02:03;02:02:07;"doing the core s***. And it's like, they know that their core audience is like motherf***ers"
02:02:07;02:02:11;"that smoke bad weed. Cause like, I used to like eat the middle out of the Ben and Jerry's"
02:02:11;02:02:15;"anyway and fill it up with other s*** like Sunday syrup and like cereal and all types"
02:02:15;02:02:16;"of wild."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"- That reminds me, I can't remember if this is a tweet or something you said to me once,"
02:02:19;02:02:25;"but you were like, more of these like snack companies should hire like super stoners for"
02:02:25;02:02:30;"their R&D departments. Because I think your joke was just like the kind of creative s***"
02:02:30;02:02:36;"that you come up with late night in the kitchen, being like, just like super baked is next level."
02:02:36;02:02:42;"- You know what I'm saying? Who knew using Eggo waffles as bread for a Goober grape sandwich"
02:02:42;02:02:46;"is delicious. It's crispy, it's soft, it's delicious. Try it."
02:02:46;02:02:48;"- Mix and stuff with ice cream. Very smart."
02:02:48;02:02:49;"- Hashtag ad."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"- Hashtag ad. All right, good talking to you, Merrell."
02:02:51;02:02:53;"- Yeah, I love you, man. Stay safe out there, man."
02:02:53;02:02:56;"- Come back soon. Good to see you. All right, bye."
02:02:56;02:02:57;"- Have a serve."
02:02:57;02:02:58;"- Bye."

02:03:40;02:03:48;"I hope in our conversation with, you know, we've got the kind of academic side from Professor Vitale,"
02:03:48;02:03:53;"got Merrell, somebody actually, you know, growing up in the city, talking about real stories."
02:03:53;02:03:58;"I just hope that people, anybody listening, we might have some random right-wingers who are just like"
02:03:58;02:04:03;"never going to be open to these conversations on some like weird All Lives Matter thing."
02:04:03;02:04:08;"But I just hope that for the rest of us, I just like hope we keep getting to the root of it."
02:04:08;02:04:12;"That's my biggest fear is just that people will continue to suffer."
02:04:12;02:04:18;"And even this moment that feels unprecedented will then just turn out to be just another one."
02:04:18;02:04:22;"Just like these other moments seemed unprecedented in the late 60s."
02:04:22;02:04:25;"The Rodney King riots in the early 90s,"
02:04:25;02:04:29;"that seemed like a moment where the mask was coming off, the inequality was too great,"
02:04:29;02:04:31;"the injustice was too great."
02:04:31;02:04:39;"And yet somehow even that anger was subdued and controlled and didn't change things."
02:04:39;02:04:45;"So I hope for especially people with privilege who can actually influence policy and stuff."
02:04:45;02:04:51;"Like you said, it's really great that people are in the streets and posting and talking with family members."
02:04:51;02:04:56;"That's all important, but these budget meeting stuff, that kind of like dry budget meeting stuff,"
02:04:56;02:04:58;"that feels like very important."
02:04:58;02:05:04;"Anyway, everybody just keep thinking, keep learning, keep researching."
02:05:04;02:05:08;"Time crisis, for now it's going to go back to bi-weekly."
02:05:08;02:05:12;"Maybe we can find out some ways to have some fun in the bi-week still."
02:05:12;02:05:15;"Maybe me and Jake jump on Instagram Live."
02:05:15;02:05:18;"I don't know. We'll figure something out."
02:05:18;02:05:24;"But keep your eyes peeled because we're going to throw up the lost episode sometime in the next week."
02:05:24;02:05:27;"And it's fun. We're talking Chunky Dunkies."
02:05:27;02:05:31;"We got a nice call-in from a friend of the show, Jonah Hill."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"It was a strong episode."
02:05:33;02:05:35;"Also had a call-in from Aaron Olson."
02:05:35;02:05:38;"Oh, that's right. We talked with LA Takedown."
02:05:38;02:05:40;"Had a great conversation."
02:05:40;02:05:43;"So anyway, hope everybody's staying safe."
02:05:43;02:05:47;"People who are out there protesting especially, be safe in many ways."
