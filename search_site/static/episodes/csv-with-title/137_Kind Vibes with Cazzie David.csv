00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back once again. The world continues to live in a state of crisis."
00:06;00:11;"Guitar Center has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but fear not, Jake and I are"
00:11;00:15;"here to sort through the mess. We're also joined by longtime friend of the show"
00:15;00:23;"Kazzy David to talk dead and co. and the new Lady Gaga Oreos. This is a very"
00:23;00:33;"vibey, getting towards the end of the year episode of Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:19;01:25;"Time Crisis back once again. I'm just finishing a bowl of cereal, trying to"
01:25;01:31;"get pumped for this episode. What's up Jake? Not much man, what kind of milk was"
01:31;01:35;"on that cereal? I think almond, which is not my favorite, just happened to be what"
01:35;01:41;"was in the fridge. What's your go-to? Lately Milkadamia. When I see it in the"
01:41;01:46;"fridge I go for that one. So you guys are rocking multiple nut milks? Oh yeah,"
01:46;01:53;"we're a multi-nut milk household. Respect. I was just eating, I think it's"
01:53;01:57;"like a keto cereal or something called Magic Spoon. It's supposed to be like a"
01:57;02:02;"healthier version of fun cereals. Like what's a fun cereal, like Froot Loops or"
02:02;02:07;"something? Yeah, it's like Little O's. This one was like peanut butter, Little O's,"
02:07;02:15;"but it's like, you know, it's made out of like spider sugar. Spider sugar? I think"
02:15;02:19;"it's like an old Mr. Show joke. I probably haven't seen that show since like I was"
02:19;02:24;"in college. Yeah. This is such a funny middle period that I feel like is the"
02:24;02:29;"period I really came into my own was like that just kind of like awkward"
02:29;02:34;"middle internet period. Where before streaming everything but still like"
02:34;02:38;"where the internet was good enough that I could like download the entirety of"
02:38;02:43;"Mr. Show, like a show that I didn't get to see in the 90s and then I was like in"
02:43;02:47;"college and I could download all of Mr. Show on like Soul Seek. Anyway, I kind of"
02:47;02:50;"remember there being a joke about spider sugar as like a kind of healthy"
02:50;02:53;"ingredient. But you know, it's probably all like ancient grains and stuff like"
02:53;02:59;"that. Yeah. You got any cereal at your house, Jake? No, I'll eat granola. That's my go-to"
02:59;03:05;"morning. Right. It's like a plain Greek yogurt with like some kind granola. Oh, right."
03:05;03:09;"Kind brand granola. I feel like that came up on the TC thread. I think you guys"
03:09;03:15;"were bashing on kind bars. Yeah. And I went to bat for kind granola, but yeah. Yeah, I"
03:15;03:19;"don't know if I really actually have a problem with it or just like got kind of"
03:19;03:23;"like oversaturated. I kind of remember in the early days, kind bars being everywhere,"
03:23;03:28;"seeing that in a store, backstage situation, being like, ""All right, a nice"
03:28;03:33;"simple snack."" And then at some point it just turned a corner for me. Maybe I just"
03:33;03:38;"had too many. Honestly, it felt less kind. It's like a slightly less processed"
03:38;03:42;"Snickers. Yeah. And it's like a big company too, right? Like, that's why we were"
03:42;03:48;"talking about it. Cause it was just bought for like billions of dollars. You"
03:48;03:51;"know, it's like, there's always like a turning point where something, no pun"
03:51;03:55;"intended, just starts to feel less kind. Yeah, no, it's funny with that, like that"
03:55;03:59;"font choice. Like there's nothing really kind about it. Yeah. It's very like"
03:59;04:05;"austere and kind of like corporate. Sans Serif, all capital letters, KIND. There's"
04:05;04:09;"nothing about that company that makes me think of like the adjective kind. You"
04:09;04:12;"know, there's like an actor named Richard Kind. Oh yeah. Maybe just like the"
04:12;04:19;"founder of Kind Bars is just named like Jason Kind. Why'd you call it Kind Bars?"
04:19;04:23;"You know, you're expecting this story. It's like, well, honestly, I was at the"
04:23;04:28;"University of Vermont Business School in the mid eighties and I always wanted to"
04:28;04:32;"start a company that also helped people. You're expecting that story to just like,"
04:32;04:37;"""Oh, my name's Jason Kind and I saw a hole in the market and I intended to fill"
04:37;04:40;"it and I'm currently a billionaire. And actually I'm taking a lot of that money"
04:40;04:44;"and investing it in a little bit in cryptocurrency, a little bit in the"
04:44;04:50;"defense industry."" I think I'm going to get to see some really big returns. It's just like, ""Damn!"""
04:54;04:57;"I'm at my wits end"
04:57;04:59;"You say your love is bonafide"
04:59;05:02;"But that don't coincide"
05:02;05:04;"With the things that you do"
05:04;05:08;"And when I ask you to the nights"
05:08;05:11;"You say you gotta be"
05:11;05:14;"Cruel to be kind in the right measure"
05:14;05:18;"Cruel to be kind, that's a very good sign"
05:18;05:25;"Cruel to be kind, means that I love you, baby"
05:25;05:28;"You gotta be cruel to be kind"
05:28;05:32;"I feel like if you hear about a company selling, it's always for over a billion"
05:32;05:37;"And you're sort of just like, really? Granola bars? Like, are selling for billions of dollars?"
05:37;05:44;"Like, if you told me, like, oh, Kind Bar sold to, like, Nestle for, like, 300 million, I'd be like, yeah, okay, right"
05:44;05:48;"You know what I always think of? That line in the social network?"
05:48;05:53;"A million dollars is cool, but you know what's cooler? A billion"
05:53;05:55;"He says a million dollars isn't cool"
05:55;05:57;"A million dollars isn't cool"
05:57;06:00;"All I remember is what's cool, a billion"
06:00;06:02;"That's the only part I really remember from it"
06:02;06:07;"I'm working on a screenplay about Jason Kind, and there's a very similar line"
06:07;06:12;"I think enough time has passed since the social network came out that hopefully people won't really catch it"
06:12;06:18;"Jason Kind's, like, mentor figure is, like, a dude who kind of cut his teeth at Hershey"
06:18;06:20;"And he gives him some similar advice"
06:20;06:25;"By the way, Seinfeld isn't here yet, so he can't do a number crunch, but we're waiting on Seinfeld"
06:25;06:30;"Nick, maybe you go ahead and text Seinfeld, I don't know where he is, maybe he's in a cab or something"
06:30;06:35;"Just say, you know, if you have a chance, maybe start crunching some Kind Bar numbers for us on the way over"
06:35;06:41;"And then whenever he gets here in, like, 45 minutes and we're well onto another topic, we can loop back to it"
06:41;06:44;"Also, I think I've said this on the show before"
06:44;06:47;"Honestly, I would love to find a guest who can actually break this down for us"
06:47;06:52;"Because I also have this weird feeling about candy bars and stuff like Kind Bars"
06:52;06:56;"And I remember reading the article about the Kind acquisition, whoever bought it"
06:56;07:00;"But yeah, it was spending big money, and they were kind of talking about the history of the company"
07:00;07:06;"And one thing that jumped out to me, because it kind of resonated with my own lived experience as a Kind Bar consumer"
07:06;07:11;"Was that a huge game changer for them was when they secured the Starbucks deal"
07:11;07:17;"And next thing you know, there's Kind Bars in every Starbucks in the country, introducing a whole new audience to it"
07:17;07:22;"So then I think about, like, with products like a candy bar, or any kind of snack food"
07:22;07:27;"You know, you picture, like, an old school story that's just like, Sweet Martha just made these cookies"
07:27;07:31;"And just, like, they were flying off the shelves at the Minnesota State Fair"
07:31;07:36;"And, you know, year in, year out, people came back, word of mouth, people loved this"
07:36;07:38;"You know, the marketplace was really into it"
07:38;07:42;"But now, when I think about, like, a bar, it almost just seems like some mafia sh*t"
07:42;07:46;"Where it's kind of like, any given moment, there's probably like a million knuckleheads"
07:46;07:48;"Who has, like, a new angle on a granola bar"
07:48;07:54;"A bunch of, like, Shark Tank type people being like, ""This one uses spider sugar, this one uses cricket flour"""
07:54;07:58;"You know, whatever, there's infinite numbers of them, they're probably all decent"
07:58;08:01;"It's pretty hard to actually, like, f*ck up a snack bar"
08:01;08:05;"And then, it doesn't seem to me, and again, I'm ignorant here"
08:05;08:10;"But it doesn't seem to me like, the winner is the one that, little by little, grows through word of mouth"
08:10;08:12;"And the marketplace decides on"
08:12;08:18;"It seems like the winner is the one who, like, flies out to Seattle, stays at the Big Barmer Hotel"
08:18;08:22;"Pitches Starbucks, I don't know, maybe, like, takes somebody out for a steak dinner or some sh*t"
08:22;08:25;"I don't know, slides them 300 bucks and secures the deal"
08:25;08:31;"And the next thing you know, they get some other deal"
08:31;08:35;"Where they're, like, suddenly in every corner store in America"
08:35;08:39;"It's like, either you're on the shelves of the big stores or you're not"
08:39;08:43;"Maybe now in COVID times, there's other ways around it"
08:43;08:45;"That's very valuable real estate"
08:45;08:51;"And I feel like either corporate of Starbucks, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid"
08:51;08:54;"Agrees to put you on the shelf, or they don't"
08:54;08:58;"You don't even have a chance to, like, present your wares to the American people"
08:58;09:00;"If you don't grease some palms"
09:00;09:05;"I'm hesitant to, because I think this Jason Kaye narrative is so good"
09:05;09:08;"That I'm almost hesitant to tell you anything about the real guy"
09:08;09:09;"Oh, I don't want to know"
09:09;09:11;"But I do, but I think I have to"
09:11;09:12;"I don't want to know"
09:12;09:15;"His name's Daniel Lubetzky"
09:15;09:20;"And he's the son of a Holocaust survivor and a Mexican Jew of Lithuanian ancestry"
09:20;09:21;"Okay"
09:21;09:26;"And I only tell you that because this Jason Kaye narrative may just be too mean to him"
09:26;09:29;"Lubetzky, you're welcome on the show to defend yourself"
09:29;09:33;"I'd be willing to dedicate a whole episode to Daniel Lubetzky"
09:33;09:35;"We're going to call the episode ""Are You Kind?"""
09:35;09:41;"And we'll be like, ""Alright, man, you're the face of Kind Bar, you're a recent billionaire"""
09:41;09:46;"Although I imagine, like, he's probably like, ""Hold on a second, I'm not a billionaire"""
09:46;09:50;"And then he's like, ""I only have $600 million, like, I wish!"""
09:50;09:52;"You know, like"
09:52;09:56;"But yeah, I'd love to just, like, pick his brain and find out more about the history of the company"
09:56;09:58;"Seinfeld, welcome to the show"
09:58;09:59;"Thank you for joining us"
09:59;10:00;"Hey, what's up?"
10:00;10:03;"What do you know about Kind Bars? Did you crunch any numbers on your way over?"
10:03;10:05;"I, you know, I don't know a whole lot"
10:05;10:13;"What is it? Like, it's some sort of, like, newfangled granola protein bar that keeps you going, but in an ethical sense?"
10:13;10:16;"The way that I've experienced the bars is that the bar--"
10:16;10:18;"Well, Jake eats the granola, that's how we started talking about it"
10:18;10:21;"Jake's taken down two to three bags of Kind a week"
10:21;10:23;"Probably a bag a week"
10:23;10:24;"One bag?"
10:24;10:25;"One bag a week"
10:25;10:30;"Anyway, well, Seinfeld, you're the numbers guy, how much was the Kind company purchased for?"
10:30;10:36;"Okay, I'm seeing it was reported-- so Kind is valued at $5 billion"
10:36;10:41;"How is that possible?"
10:41;10:46;"According to the New York Times, the deal values Kind at $5 billion"
10:46;10:48;"Yeah, I don't know how that's possible, that seems like--"
10:48;10:53;"They don't have any real estate, they sell granola! How is that worth $5 billion?"
10:53;10:56;"There's a lot of people like you out there, Jake"
10:56;10:59;"Do we have to switch you over to a local small batch granola?"
10:59;11:00;"Probably"
11:00;11:06;"First we'll get Lubetsky on the show, find out, is he Kind, and then we can make the call"
11:06;11:10;"But wait, Jake, how did you specifically get on Kind Granola in the first place? Do you remember?"
11:10;11:12;"This is so stupid"
11:12;11:14;"I mean, this goes to what you think"
11:14;11:19;"Wait, because you're hearing about the $5 billion figure for the first time, right now"
11:19;11:21;"Me, yes, I'm hearing about that"
11:21;11:27;"Okay, alright, because I thought maybe you were just reading the business section, you saw $5 billion valuation"
11:27;11:29;"Hannah, let's switch to Kind Granola"
11:29;11:31;"But it's actually the opposite"
11:31;11:33;"That's not what happened"
11:33;11:34;"No, now I'm turned off"
11:34;11:36;"Okay, it's the opposite, I see"
11:36;11:40;"I don't understand why a company that sells granola is worth $5 billion, but--"
11:40;11:47;"Jake, they sell $1.5 billion worth of product a year, up from a billion per year in 2017"
11:47;11:50;"Oh, so that valuation's not crazy then"
11:50;11:51;"Wow"
11:51;11:54;"No, and Mars, you know, the Mars company bought them, and from what I'm reading--"
11:54;11:56;"Oh, that's who bought it?"
11:56;12:01;"Yeah, so Mars bought them, and from what I'm reading, I think that that value is that they believe"
12:01;12:10;"with their infrastructure, and marketing, and distribution pipeline, they can really scale Kind"
12:10;12:13;"Our friends at Hershey's are going to need a competitor"
12:13;12:16;"We gotta go start a little granola operation"
12:16;12:21;"And give Hershey's something to fight with, because I think Kind's going to be worth $10 billion soon"
12:21;12:27;"This is what's so stupid, and I think it goes to what you were saying about the value of real estate on grocery shelves"
12:27;12:33;"I'm in the grocery aisle, I'm picking up granola, and I gotta say, this is really dumb"
12:33;12:39;"It goes to my college-educated, middle-brow tastes"
12:39;12:45;"That clean, sans-serif, international font, that appealed to me"
12:45;12:51;"The simple blocks of color, like on the blueberry one, there's a blue, there's one that's purple"
12:51;12:53;"It's a great design"
12:53;13:00;"I'm not saying that I like the Kind vibe, hippie ethos, the packaging on those hippie granolas are ugly"
13:00;13:01;"Really?"
13:01;13:03;"I don't feel good about it"
13:03;13:06;"Whoa, I'm seeing a whole new dimension"
13:06;13:08;"No, but this is not conscious thought"
13:08;13:10;"You're unpacking it now, I see"
13:10;13:14;"I don't like it, I don't like this side of myself, I'm a complete conformist"
13:14;13:18;"I'm actually going against my ideals, and just mindlessly buying Kind"
13:18;13:24;"Because of the real estate they occupy in the aisle, I'm out, I'm gonna switch brands"
13:24;13:30;"Alright, well, Lubezki, if you're hearing this, you just lost a customer, so please come on"
13:30;13:32;"Please come on"
13:32;13:39;"Well, you know what that's called, if anybody from the Kind company or Mars is listening"
13:39;13:42;"That's called suffering from success"
13:42;13:46;"Is that a DJ Khaled album?"
13:46;13:52;"That's gonna be like the cover of the Bloomberg Magazine, Wall Street Journal"
13:52;13:58;"Daniel Lubezki just suffering from success with high profile defections from his Ascendant brand"
13:58;14:01;"Mr. Lubezki is suffering from success"
14:01;14:04;"On a recent episode of the internet radio show Time Crisis"
14:04;14:09;"American painter Jake Longstreth declared he was done with Kind"
14:09;14:11;"I'm suffering"
14:11;14:16;"On that road I live, on that road I live, on that road I live"
14:16;14:18;"I'm suffering"
14:18;14:23;"On that road I live, on that road I live, on that road I live"
14:23;14:25;"I'm suffering"
14:25;14:32;"According to their Wikipedia, they sold $1 million worth of granola in its first year"
14:32;14:34;"What year was that?"
14:34;14:35;"2004"
14:35;14:39;"So is that possible to do unless you've already bought placement?"
14:39;14:41;"I mean, I think you're right, is my point"
14:41;14:50;"It feels like there's already a placement buy, a marketing buy, some sort of conspiracy of distribution"
14:50;14:57;"I guess the best case scenario, if it's not about greasing palms and like top-down directives"
14:57;14:59;"Being like, this is what people are gonna buy now"
14:59;15:06;"I can occasionally think of being in like a local supermarket and rolling up on a sample stand"
15:06;15:12;"And somebody's giving you like a bite, you know, little bites of like a cookie or who knows, it could be granola"
15:12;15:13;"Some little product"
15:13;15:18;"I can think of a few times in my life where you roll up and you kind of realize as you're talking to the person"
15:18;15:21;"Like this is their comfort and this is what they're doing"
15:21;15:22;"Yeah"
15:22;15:24;"These are Todd's brownies"
15:24;15:26;"I'm Todd, I'm a local dude"
15:26;15:28;"Yeah, we sell them at the store"
15:28;15:31;"Maybe that's like the most kind vibe way that this stuff could start"
15:31;15:34;"Is maybe, you know, that's like what you want to believe"
15:34;15:37;"And maybe this happened with Daniel Lubecki too"
15:37;15:42;"Is that you go to your local supermarket and you're just like, hey, I'm an entrepreneur"
15:42;15:43;"I started this"
15:43;15:46;"And they say, all right, we'll buy a very small amount"
15:46;15:49;"You come through on Sunday, set up a little stand and see how it does"
15:49;15:53;"I'm sure it's very tough, probably sometimes demoralizing"
15:53;15:56;"But probably once in a while, somebody like goes to the local supermarket"
15:56;16:00;"People are stopping by to say, holy s**t, yeah, tell y'all buy a box"
16:00;16:03;"And then next thing you know, the store is like, wow, that was a huge hit"
16:03;16:06;"We'd like to place a big order for the rest of the year"
16:06;16:09;"And then word spreads and then it catches like wildfire"
16:09;16:14;"And then you're just getting a call from like the buyer of like a big regional supermarket"
16:14;16:19;"Who's like, yeah, I've heard actually like two of my stores can't get enough of your brownies"
16:19;16:22;"We want to place an order for like all of Pennsylvania"
16:22;16:25;"All of the Kroger-owned supermarkets in Southern California"
16:25;16:28;"My first question for you, are you ready to play with the big boys?"
16:28;16:30;"Can you keep up with demand? Yes, sir"
16:30;16:32;"This is so Shark Tank"
16:32;16:36;"I actually watched the first episode of Shark Tank last night"
16:36;16:38;"Whoa, what'd you think?"
16:38;16:39;"I was pretty into it"
16:39;16:44;"Well, there was this guy that was pitching this sauce he made that was called Bang House"
16:44;16:52;"There was like a vegan one, a vegetarian one, and then sort of like meat-based one"
16:52;16:54;"But they were just like dipping sauces"
16:54;16:56;"Oh, it's not like a tomato sauce?"
16:56;16:58;"No, no, it's like sauce for like chips"
16:58;17:01;"You could put it on pasta, you could put it on a burrito, you could put it on a burger"
17:01;17:03;"It's just like an all-purpose sauce"
17:03;17:07;"You know, I was just watching the show and like Mark Cuban's just like, oh, hell yeah"
17:07;17:09;"That's great"
17:09;17:13;"But then like the whole rub was like, okay, can you scale up?"
17:13;17:18;"He was looking for like 250 grand or something for like 5% equity in the company"
17:18;17:20;"And they're like, can you scale up?"
17:20;17:24;"And more importantly, do you have the connects to get that real estate?"
17:24;17:26;"Because it has to be a refrigerated sauce"
17:26;17:31;"And the real estate in the refrigeration aisles in supermarkets is like super competitive"
17:31;17:34;"Wait, most sauces are not refrigerated"
17:34;17:36;"Sauces you don't buy are refrigerated"
17:36;17:38;"Like the fancy stuff is refrigerated"
17:38;17:41;"Okay, so right, there's very limited real estate for that"
17:41;17:45;"Yeah, I'm not sure what was in, I wish they had gone into more like what was in the sauce"
17:45;17:52;"If we started our own bank sauce today, we'd probably dedicate two to three months of time crisis on our own bank sauce"
17:52;17:54;"And we can do that"
17:54;17:59;"But yeah, obviously like online sales for a refrigerated sauce, maybe not even possible"
17:59;18:02;"I mean, think back to the Garfield Eats guy"
18:02;18:05;"Right, that came up when they were like, you can't ship this stuff"
18:05;18:07;"It's got to be sold in stores"
18:07;18:09;"How are you going to get it into the stores, dude?"
18:09;18:12;"He's probably hitting like a real fork in the road moment too"
18:12;18:17;"Where you could imagine maybe like one of the ingredients in bank sauce is holding it back"
18:17;18:20;"It's expensive, it requires it to be refrigerated"
18:20;18:23;"And they're like, come on, like let's work on the formula"
18:23;18:26;"It might not quite taste like classic bank sauce, but like think about it"
18:26;18:28;"Now we can get it all over the place"
18:28;18:31;"It's like, you're really going to have to be like, what do I do here?"
18:31;18:33;"Are you a real artist or not, dude?"
18:33;18:35;"Yeah, seriously"
18:35;18:38;"Speaking of businesses, should we talk Guitar Center?"
18:38;18:40;"Shifting gears, only slightly"
18:40;18:44;"I mean, we can keep talking sauces for another 40 minutes, I'm down"
18:44;18:50;"I know you did a bunch of research this week about Guitar Center"
18:50;18:54;"The reason that we decided to talk about Guitar Center is because it went bankrupt"
18:54;18:56;"Is that correct? Was that the big news?"
18:56;19:00;"Well, yes, there were two news stories that for some reason in my head became conflated"
19:00;19:05;"Which was, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton released an anti-lockdown song"
19:05;19:06;"Yes"
19:06;19:10;"But also, Guitar Center filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy"
19:10;19:15;"But Eric Clapton, in my research, I discovered that Eric Clapton and Guitar Center have a long history together"
19:15;19:19;"I mean, I can just definitely picture him on the front of every Guitar Center"
19:19;19:20;"Yes"
19:20;19:22;"He's like one of the go-to guys"
19:22;19:25;"Well, I guess just first, before you get into the whole history of Guitar Center"
19:25;19:27;"What do you know about Chapter 11 bankruptcy?"
19:27;19:30;"Because I heard some people being like, don't freak out"
19:30;19:32;"Guitar Center's fine"
19:32;19:38;"But when you file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it's not because your sales are tanking"
19:38;19:40;"Because I've even heard that guitar sales were up this year"
19:40;19:42;"I mean, that would make sense"
19:42;19:45;"Right, it might just be that maybe they've invested in some sh*t that didn't pan out"
19:45;19:49;"Or maybe it's just like a cautious move"
19:49;19:51;"Maybe it's a tax thing"
19:51;19:53;"But Guitar Center's doing okay, right?"
19:53;19:55;"I think so, I think it's a little bit"
19:55;19:58;"Remember how we were talking on some other episodes about like"
19:58;20:03;"Our entire lifetime, Sears has declared bankruptcy every 18 months"
20:03;20:05;"But it still exists"
20:05;20:09;"There's still Sears, you can still go to Sears or buy stuff from Sears online"
20:09;20:12;"So, they declared bankruptcy"
20:12;20:18;"I've cut and pasted all of this hilarious, dense financial language into a Word document"
20:18;20:21;"Hell yeah, let's get into it, the history of Guitar Center"
20:21;20:27;"So the most recent news is that an announced plan is to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection"
20:27;20:31;"After negotiating a debt cutting deal with key investors and lenders"
20:31;20:33;"No announcements have been made to close any stores"
20:33;20:38;"And currently the restructuring is fully a financial restructuring process"
20:38;20:41;"Chapter 11 filing would give the company a break on its debts"
20:41;20:45;"And let it keep operating while management works out a turnaround"
20:45;20:46;"That's vague"
20:46;20:49;"It would use the court process to implement the debt deal"
20:49;20:53;"While continuing to pay employees and vendors as usual"
20:53;20:55;"So, they're moving money around"
20:55;20:58;"And that's really been like, you know, it's like when you look at these corporate histories"
20:58;21:02;"I read the Wikipedia and then also went to the Guitar Center website"
21:02;21:05;"Which actually has a pretty in-depth history"
21:05;21:09;"And it's always like the first like 10 or 20 years is like interesting, they're growing"
21:09;21:15;"And then the last like 20 years, like all the 21st century history is just like restructuring"
21:15;21:19;"They got, there's a buyout, there's like a leverage position that goes sideways"
21:19;21:21;"Sounds like a real Red Lobster type story"
21:21;21:25;"It's like, this is not that interesting, but this is perfect"
21:25;21:27;"It's like"
21:27;21:35;"Guitar Center is a hometown business founded in Hollywood in 1959"
21:35;21:37;"Is the big one on Sunset like the original?"
21:37;21:40;"That was opened in '85, I believe"
21:40;21:41;"Okay"
21:41;21:43;"It was originally called the Organ Center"
21:43;21:46;"Which is a terrible name"
21:46;21:47;"Yeah"
21:47;21:49;"I guess they were selling like Hammond organs and stuff"
21:49;21:53;"And then the Beatles like got super popular"
21:53;21:57;"And they changed their name to the Vox Center in 1964"
21:57;22:00;"Which I think the Beatles used a lot of Vox amplifiers"
22:00;22:05;"And then in '71 they changed their name to Guitar Center"
22:05;22:10;"And at that point like Eric Clapton and Hendrix were using like Marshall Stax and like Benders and"
22:10;22:13;"That was the cool vibe, like more like rock"
22:13;22:15;"And then it was like they opened one in San Diego, San Francisco"
22:15;22:20;"And it was like a regional like California music retailer throughout the '70s"
22:20;22:23;"By '85 they had expanded to 12 stores"
22:23;22:27;"And then they started to grow in the '90s like a lot of these chains did"
22:27;22:31;"They have an IPO in '97, they opened 70 stores in the '90s"
22:31;22:34;"They opened their 100th store in 2002"
22:34;22:39;"So it's like even like 18 years ago they weren't that big of a chain, only 100 stores"
22:39;22:41;"Although they are big stores"
22:41;22:43;"It is one of those sectors of the retail environment where you're like"
22:43;22:46;"I've always been mystified by the Guitar Center"
22:46;22:49;"Because it's like, why is that like a chain store?"
22:49;22:52;"Like guitar stores always seem like one of those things that's like"
22:52;22:55;"There's a local guy who's passionate about like gear and like"
22:55;22:59;"Buying and selling used equipment and like yeah, stocking new stuff as well"
22:59;23:04;"And like the guys that like hang out at like baseball card stores or comic book stores or bookstores"
23:04;23:08;"I guess it's the exact same thing as bookstores which I'm sure has changed a lot"
23:08;23:14;"But it's like there's a certain type of person who would have no need for a Barnes & Noble"
23:14;23:15;"Right"
23:15;23:19;"But because it's like you'd be looking for something so specific"
23:19;23:22;"Or you're into used books or something so you wouldn't roll there"
23:22;23:26;"But for the average person who is not deep into that world"
23:26;23:30;"And just wants to go get a new book as a gift or something"
23:30;23:34;"Or their kid says I want to learn about something"
23:34;23:37;"And you want to give them a gift and not go to the library you're going to run"
23:37;23:40;"Go to Barnes & Noble because it seems familiar"
23:40;23:43;"And maybe it's the same thing like you want to go get your first guitar"
23:43;23:48;"You're not like going to go like really get into the weeds about like humbuckers"
23:48;23:54;"With a local dude who wants to like haggle about like you know some 68 Strat or something"
23:54;23:59;"Oh yeah or like you're buying your like nephew like a high school graduation present"
23:59;24:03;"And you're like I just want to get him like an acoustic guitar that's like 200 bucks"
24:03;24:09;"And like I could see the like crusty weird guitar stores being kind of like intimidating or something"
24:09;24:15;"If you're outside that world and you want the sort of like high ceiling like corporate veneer"
24:15;24:19;"Right it's like back in the it's like version megastore versus other music"
24:19;24:20;"Yeah"
24:20;24:25;"It's also funny too also go back to like the Kine Bar thing the concept of like real estate"
24:25;24:28;"And also kind of like the illusion of consumer choice"
24:28;24:37;"But it's like does a place like Guitar Center become so big because a lot of consumers preferred it to the mom and pops"
24:37;24:42;"Or did it become so big because they had a lot of capital and they bet big on themselves"
24:42;24:46;"And they just moved into towns and took over because they had cheaper prices"
24:46;24:51;"Yeah because they I mean they opened their 100th store 2002 in Little Rock Arkansas"
24:51;24:55;"I would imagine there was like some pretty sweet guitar stores in Little Rock Arkansas"
24:55;24:57;"Probably still are too"
24:57;24:58;"Right"
24:58;25:01;"Look at you all"
25:01;25:07;"See the love that's sleeping"
25:07;25:15;"While my guitar gently weeps"
25:15;25:18;"Look at the floor"
25:18;25:24;"And I see it needs sweeping"
25:24;25:33;"Still my guitar gently weeps"
25:33;25:37;"I don't know why"
25:37;25:41;"Nobody told you"
25:41;25:50;"How to unfold your love"
25:50;25:54;"I don't know how"
25:54;25:58;"Someone controlled you"
25:58;26:02;"Better than parts of the soul"
26:02;26:09;"Then it goes deep then it goes into hyperdrive like full global capitalism vibe like 2007"
26:09;26:12;"Bain Capital buys Guitar Center for 2 billion"
26:12;26:14;"Always Bain Capital"
26:14;26:16;"Wait so this is 2007?"
26:16;26:20;"Yeah we're talking about Kind being valued at 5 billion"
26:20;26:22;"Less than half of Kind bars"
26:22;26:26;"I mean this is 13 years ago but think about the real estate Guitar Center has"
26:26;26:28;"Yeah do they own that real estate?"
26:28;26:30;"Great question"
26:30;26:32;"Oh yeah very McDonald's style"
26:32;26:36;"I bet Guitar Center owns that real estate on Sunset because they've been there for a long time"
26:36;26:42;"Also do you think that like in that Batman movie they named Bain because of Bain Capital"
26:42;26:46;"I was always wondering about that like Bain Capital and then like is it spelled differently?"
26:46;26:54;"It's spelled differently Bain the Batman character is B-A-N-E as opposed to Bain Capital B-A-I-N"
26:54;27:00;"Well I think the Bain character was in the comics probably at least since the 80s"
27:00;27:05;"The Seinfeld could get a number crunch on issue and year of the first Bain appearance"
27:05;27:10;"So I think by the time he was in the movie obviously a lot more people were put onto his existence"
27:10;27:17;"Long before that but I do remember when Mitt Romney was running against Obama in 2012"
27:17;27:21;"And he famously had been a major dude at Bain Capital"
27:21;27:28;"That movie had just come out and I remember seeing posters that some artists had made around New York"
27:28;27:33;"That was basically like the Bain character wearing the mask except it was like Mitt Romney's face"
27:33;27:34;"Right, right"
27:34;27:38;"Probably Mitt Romney's candidacy made the Bain Capital name"
27:38;27:44;"I'm sure it was very famous in the finance world but made it more mainstream probably in that era"
27:44;27:50;"And then people started to be like oh what a f*cking harsh name for Bain Capital"
27:50;27:59;"Bain debuted in January 1993 in Batman Vengeance of Bain #1 in DC Comics"
27:59;28:01;"Bain is a Gen X villain"
28:01;28:10;"So 2007 Bain acquires them, 2013 Standard & Poor's cuts its debt rating to a junk bond status"
28:10;28:13;"Citing struggles with a weak operating trend"
28:13;28:15;"So things are on shaky ground"
28:15;28:22;"And then 2014 a firm called Aries Management takes a controlling stake in Guitar Center"
28:22;28:25;"This is where it gets really Byzantine and confusing"
28:25;28:29;"Bain is still like a partial owner, Bain still has a C board"
28:29;28:36;"And then that same year, 2014, where things are getting more and more weird with the ownership"
28:36;28:39;"It seems like things are shaky with all this restructuring"
28:39;28:44;"That same year Guitar Center opens a 28,000 square foot location in Times Square"
28:44;28:45;"Have you been to that one?"
28:45;28:52;"No, but that's funny because Times Square has always forever had a lot of music stores"
28:52;28:55;"52nd Street, which is more or less the Times Square area"
28:55;29:01;"That used to be all the Billy Joel named album after it, jazz clubs, music stores, all that s*** drama"
29:01;29:07;"Wait, but you said this was 2001 that Standard & Poor's downgraded the debt rating?"
29:07;29:08;"2013!"
29:08;29:12;"Oh, 2013, so that's when Aries came in"
29:12;29:19;"Yeah, Aries came in in 2014 and then the Times Square location also opened in 2014"
29:19;29:25;"It's just funny too, because I'm picturing, I'm very familiar with 2013, the year Modern Vampires came out"
29:25;29:33;"It definitely did feel like the end of the indie boom, but now I'm just like kind of, of one indie boom"
29:33;29:39;"Obviously there are many, but I'm kind of like picturing a dude, a young analyst from Aries Capital"
29:39;29:45;"Being like, we're looking at Guitar Center, and he's like, alright, what do you think is the trend for Guitar Center?"
29:45;29:51;"And they sell a lot of music equipment, but they're bread and butter guitars, as the name implies"
29:51;29:56;"That's their currency, and I'm just picturing a young analyst in 2014 just being kind of like"
29:56;29:59;"Well, look, the trend lines for guitar music are not great"
29:59;30:03;"And then there's an older dude, he's like, what? What about The Strokes, man?"
30:03;30:08;"I thought guitar music was back, he's like, well, their debut album was 2001, sir"
30:08;30:15;"But, frankly, the 2010s, kicked off with my beautiful Dark Twister Fantasy by Kanye"
30:15;30:20;"Really seemed to be a decade primarily defined by hip-hop and pop"
30:20;30:23;"There's a trend in music criticism called ""poptimism"""
30:23;30:29;"So I gotta say, if we can't purchase our stake at the current valuation, I don't think we should do it"
30:29;30:33;"I'm not very bullish about guitar music or guitar purchases"
30:33;30:36;"Sir, I don't want to be rude, but I do want to be candid"
30:36;30:40;"I mean this with the utmost respect, but rock is played out, dog"
30:40;30:47;"I wonder if they get into the weeds like that in their reports about trends and stuff"
30:47;30:55;"Just somebody being like, honestly, sir, Hipster Runoff isn't publishing as much these days"
30:55;30:58;"It almost looks like that blog might be a wrap"
30:58;31:01;"You're kidding me, Hipster Runoff?"
31:01;31:09;"I feel like the Guitar Center is completely unaware of any music after 1993"
31:09;31:11;"They have their DJ section"
31:11;31:13;"Oh, no, no, I guess rock music"
31:13;31:18;"They're not up on, in the broadest sense of the word, indie music"
31:18;31:22;"I mean, of course, I've had good experiences at Guitar Center"
31:22;31:27;"It's like any big store, you roll, there's sometimes a super cool person who works there"
31:27;31:33;"People work at Guitar Center often because they love music, so obviously individual employees could be aware"
31:33;31:37;"I wonder who the indiest person is who made the kind of wall of fame"
31:37;31:42;"I was going to say, I've gone to the Guitar Center in Pasadena quite a few times to buy strings"
31:42;31:48;"Because weirdly, there's a cool guitar store near my house called Future Music"
31:48;31:53;"And they don't carry strings sometimes, and it drives me up a wall a little bit"
31:53;31:56;"You're trying to support small business"
31:56;31:59;"Isn't that the bread and butter of any music store?"
31:59;32:02;"That's the thing that most people would want, most regularly"
32:02;32:04;"They're fixing gear, they're selling"
32:04;32:06;"Right, well, no, okay, that makes sense to me"
32:06;32:16;"Because there's guitar stores that are more about repairs and moving unusual or specific products"
32:16;32:17;"It's a great store"
32:17;32:19;"I've been to that store, yeah, that's a great store"
32:19;32:24;"Because that's also the place where you might want to go and be like, I'm looking for a very specific synth"
32:24;32:26;"And they'll be like, you know what, we just got one in"
32:26;32:29;"In a way that you might not at Guitar Center"
32:29;32:32;"Maybe it's not worth it at all to sell strings"
32:32;32:35;"But anyway, that sends you to Guitar Center"
32:35;32:36;"That sends you to Guitar Center"
32:36;32:44;"Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world"
32:44;32:53;"Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world"
32:53;33:04;"Here we are, without running out of confusion"
33:04;33:09;"At a time of sin or confusion, anywhere"
33:09;33:17;"And if the world dies trying, and if London burns"
33:17;33:22;"I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar"
33:22;33:29;"I want to be in a band when I get to heaven"
33:29;33:36;"Anyone can play guitar, they won't be in a band anymore"
33:37;33:40;"Oh, but I was going to say, the Clapton connection was"
33:40;33:46;"They co-founded a festival with Eric Clapton called the Crossroads Festival in 2004"
33:46;33:50;"Which is like a guitar, kind of buddy guy"
33:50;33:51;"Okay"
33:51;33:54;"AJK, those kind of like guitar guys"
33:54;33:57;"And there was one in 2019 in Texas"
33:57;34:00;"And then that same year in 2004"
34:00;34:06;"Eric Clapton was auctioning off his famous Blackie Fender Stratocaster"
34:06;34:09;"And they bought it for a million dollars"
34:09;34:10;"Which was a record at the time"
34:10;34:11;"Wow"
34:11;34:14;"And there's a little museum I think at the Times Square"
34:14;34:17;"No, no, the Times Square location"
34:17;34:20;"Let's go to Times Square and eat at the Olive Garden"
34:20;34:22;"And then go to Guitar Center"
34:22;34:25;"You can go to Hard Rock and make it a whole rock day"
34:25;34:26;"I like that"
34:26;34:28;"Lunch at Hard Rock"
34:28;34:34;"Go to Guitar Center, play the riff to Inner Sandman for a half hour"
34:34;34:37;"And then go to the Olive Garden for dinner"
34:37;34:40;"It's also kind of funny when you're talking about the Guitar Center timeline"
34:40;34:48;"One thought I had was the ways in which it kind of just mirrored rock and roll music"
34:48;34:51;"Like, Opens 1959, it's Oregon Center"
34:51;34:54;"Obviously, rock and roll existed in 1959"
34:54;34:58;"But it was one of a variety of youth musics"
34:58;35:02;"And the guitar was a cool instrument"
35:02;35:05;"But the saxophone was still cool as hell"
35:05;35:06;"Yeah"
35:06;35:12;"I don't think the guitarist had any deep cultural primacy over Miles Davis or something"
35:12;35:14;"Like, cool-ass dude with a trumpet"
35:14;35:15;"Or any shredder"
35:15;35:17;"Yeah, Little Richard on the piano, whatever"
35:17;35:18;"Right"
35:18;35:21;"There were all sorts of cool-ass musicians"
35:21;35:25;"And the idea of every kid wanting to be a guitarist I don't think quite existed"
35:25;35:29;"But like you said, Beatles, early 60s, culture changes"
35:29;35:32;"That takes over in a big way"
35:32;35:35;"And then by the end of that decade or the early next decade"
35:35;35:37;"They become Guitar Center"
35:37;35:39;"And it's like the 70s"
35:39;35:43;"Rock is not just this growing thing, changing culture like in the 60s"
35:43;35:45;"It's like the thing"
35:45;35:48;"Yes, it has platinum albums"
35:48;35:52;"English prog bands are touring the US playing arenas"
35:52;35:54;"It's still a little bit Wild West"
35:54;35:57;"But it's like, that's the thing, guitar"
35:57;35:59;"And then make it through the 80s"
35:59;36:01;"Then you hit the 90s"
36:01;36:06;"And it's kind of like the Stones, their 1989 Steel Wheels tour"
36:06;36:08;"People often talk about as being like this"
36:08;36:11;"Of course, they always played huge shows, the Stones"
36:11;36:13;"But that tour being like this level-up moment"
36:13;36:16;"Where people realized, damn, these dudes"
36:16;36:21;"People weren't sure if you were going to go catch Mick Jagger when he's 45"
36:21;36:24;"Imagine 1969 if you sat down like that"
36:24;36:28;"And you're just like, do you think you would go see these guys when they're like 47?"
36:28;36:30;"And maybe they get a corporate sponsor"
36:30;36:32;"You'd hear all that shit, like what the f*** are you talking about?"
36:32;36:36;"These guys aren't going to be playing music more than another 5 years"
36:36;36:38;"I can't even picture what it'll be like then"
36:38;36:42;"But then, f*** 1989, older dudes, the fans are still there"
36:42;36:44;"Now they're doing these big sponsored tours"
36:44;36:48;"They're pioneering all sorts of VIP packages"
36:48;36:52;"People talk about the Stones as being very good business people"
36:52;36:54;"So anyway, blasting into the 90s"
36:54;36:57;"Where rock and roll is not just big"
36:57;37:01;"But it's a huge multi-generational phenomenon"
37:01;37:05;"And that's the moment when the money pours into Guitar Center"
37:05;37:08;"And then 2013, sales are down"
37:08;37:11;"Aries Capital buys them"
37:11;37:13;"And then 2020, pandemic"
37:13;37:16;"Like I said, I heard that guitar sales are up"
37:16;37:19;"And I don't know when rock bottom for guitar sales was"
37:19;37:22;"Maybe it was like 2013, 2014"
37:22;37:25;"But I do feel like now, in a cool way"
37:25;37:29;"The guitar is increasingly understood"
37:29;37:31;"Not as the badass rock instrument"
37:31;37:33;"But just a great instrument"
37:33;37:36;"That's useful for all sorts of different types of music"
37:36;37:38;"That's also fun as a hobby"
37:38;37:41;"Sometimes people frame these stories like guitar sales are up"
37:41;37:43;"And you hear people in the music industry"
37:43;37:46;"Just being like, maybe rock's due for a comeback"
37:46;37:49;"And it's kind of like, I don't know man"
37:49;37:50;"Maybe, maybe not"
37:50;37:52;"Whenever I hear those stories"
37:52;37:54;"What actually warms my heart more"
37:54;37:56;"Is I'm just picturing more people"
37:56;38:00;"Looking to music as a rewarding hobby"
38:00;38:02;"That's more interesting than just picturing"
38:02;38:04;"It being a marker of cultural trends"
38:04;38:06;"Or maybe it's just like"
38:06;38:08;"Karate belt sales are going up"
38:08;38:10;"It doesn't mean that karate is going to replace the NFL"
38:10;38:12;"As like America's go-to sport"
38:12;38:14;"It might just mean that more people are into it"
38:14;38:16;"As exercise or like a way of calming your mind"
38:16;38:18;"You know what I mean?"
38:18;38:19;"Yeah"
38:19;38:22;"Fender guitar sales went up 17% during the pandemic"
38:22;38:23;"Whoa"
38:23;38:27;"And are expected to top $700 million in sales this year"
38:27;38:29;"That's really significant"
38:29;38:31;"17% is a big deal"
38:31;38:33;"Shout out to Fender"
38:33;38:36;"Seinfeld, what's the valuation on Fender as a company?"
38:36;38:38;"Huh"
38:38;38:40;"Is that hard to look up?"
38:40;38:42;"I don't think so"
38:42;38:43;"I might need a minute"
38:43;38:45;"I don't want you to just take this off of"
38:45;38:47;"Wall Street Journal, Seinfeld"
38:47;38:49;"I want this to be your valuation"
38:49;38:51;"Oh, my own personal valuation?"
38:51;38:53;"Based on sales, debt"
38:53;38:55;"You obviously got to look at what debt they're holding"
38:55;38:58;"And also kind of just like, you know, trend lines"
38:58;39:01;"Oh, you want like a deep CNBC style"
39:01;39:04;"Like analytic, kind of Andrew Ross Sorkin"
39:04;39:06;"Kind of breakdown"
39:06;39:08;"A true number crunch"
39:08;39:09;"Alright"
39:09;39:12;"Give me like an hour and I'll reflect back"
39:12;39:15;"Like 25 to 30 pages, double spaced"
39:15;39:17;"Oh, like a deck"
39:17;39:19;"Some pie charts"
39:19;39:21;"You want like a full presentation"
39:21;39:23;"Yeah, okay"
39:23;39:25;"In 2012"
39:25;39:29;"Fender's valuation was $395 million"
39:29;39:31;"That's it?"
39:31;39:33;"According to NBC News, but that was"
39:33;39:36;"This is just, I don't understand this"
39:36;39:39;"Kind bars are worth more than Fender?"
39:39;39:41;"We got to look under the hood on this"
39:41;39:43;"Oh, you know why? Because Fender"
39:43;39:44;"Was in debt"
39:44;39:45;"They had some financial trouble?"
39:45;39:47;"Yeah, they were"
39:47;39:48;"All these companies"
39:48;39:51;"They were in $1.6 million in debt"
39:51;39:53;"About a decade ago"
39:53;39:56;"Despite $2 billion in annual sales"
39:56;39:58;"Okay, $2 billion in annual sales"
39:58;40:00;"Alright, that's serious"
40:00;40:02;"What I'd love to see is the graph"
40:02;40:03;"Of decades"
40:03;40:05;"Like it's up 17% now, which is great"
40:05;40:07;"Fender's a great company"
40:07;40:10;"Iconic, classic American company"
40:10;40:12;"But I wonder if it's 17% up"
40:12;40:14;"From like an all-time low"
40:14;40:16;"Five or six years ago"
40:16;40:18;"I don't understand how they're selling"
40:18;40:20;"$2 billion worth of guitars a year"
40:20;40:22;"Because I feel like the big money is spent"
40:22;40:24;"On used vintage gear"
40:24;40:26;"Which none of that would go to Fender"
40:26;40:28;"How much, you know, if you're buying"
40:28;40:30;"Like a new Fender"
40:30;40:32;"At Guitar Center"
40:32;40:33;"What are you spending?"
40:33;40:35;"$500? $1,000?"
40:35;40:36;"But wait, doesn't Fender"
40:36;40:37;"They have all different levels"
40:37;40:39;"I'm sure the most expensive new Fender"
40:39;40:41;"Is thousands"
40:41;40:43;"They sell amps too, right?"
40:43;40:44;"Yeah"
40:44;40:46;"Yeah, true, true"
40:46;40:48;"I use a Fender amp"
40:48;40:50;"Almost exclusively on stage"
40:50;40:51;"Shout out to Fender"
40:51;40:53;"I can't imagine going and buying"
40:53;40:54;"A new electric guitar"
40:54;40:56;"I didn't have an electric guitar for years"
40:56;40:58;"And I bought one like"
40:58;40:59;"Maybe four or five years ago"
40:59;41:01;"And I went to all of the old"
41:01;41:02;"Weird vintage places"
41:02;41:03;"And I ended up finding a cool"
41:03;41:05;"'70s Gibson guitar"
41:05;41:06;"At a place in Burbank"
41:06;41:07;"I'm not like a gearhead"
41:07;41:08;"I don't know that much about it"
41:08;41:10;"But it just had like a good feel"
41:10;41:12;"And like, I liked that it was like"
41:12;41:13;"Old, kind of beat up"
41:13;41:14;"But sounded good"
41:14;41:16;"One of my sad"
41:16;41:17;"I'm actually looking around"
41:17;41:19;"Because as I'm thinking about it"
41:19;41:21;"I'm not much of a gearhead either"
41:21;41:22;"Although, you know, I can be"
41:22;41:24;"When we're like really getting into the weeds"
41:24;41:26;"Making music, but"
41:26;41:28;"I actually don't own any vintage"
41:28;41:30;"Electric guitars"
41:30;41:32;"I've been thinking about it recently"
41:32;41:34;"Maybe it's time because"
41:34;41:36;"On stage, generally played"
41:36;41:38;"An Epiphone Sheridan"
41:38;41:40;"And I have a bunch of Epiphone Sheridans"
41:40;41:41;"But they're all new"
41:41;41:43;"I have like a new Fender Strat"
41:43;41:45;"That I like mess around on sometimes"
41:45;41:47;"But I've always in the back of my head"
41:47;41:48;"Being like, one of these days"
41:48;41:50;"I'm gonna like really go deep"
41:50;41:52;"And find my like"
41:52;41:54;"My special vintage guitar"
41:54;41:56;"I think I might have found it"
41:57;41:59;"I think you could walk in"
41:59;42:01;"Right now to a guitar center"
42:01;42:04;"And buy the Fender Custom Shop"
42:04;42:06;"Game of Thrones House of Targaryen"
42:06;42:07;"Stratocaster"
42:07;42:08;"Nice"
42:08;42:10;"Dragon Glass Black"
42:10;42:12;"$35,000"
42:12;42:13;"What?"
42:15;42:17;"That's better than the sign by"
42:17;42:19;"George R.R. Martin and Bob Weir"
42:19;42:22;"No, there's no way they're selling that"
42:22;42:23;"I swear to God"
42:23;42:25;"I'm reading you"
42:25;42:26;"That sh*t better be made of real"
42:26;42:28;"Dragon Glass and Weirwood"
42:28;42:30;"I'm sure they made a few of them"
42:30;42:31;"There's no way they're selling that"
42:31;42:33;"People who are gonna drop $35,000 on a"
42:33;42:35;"Guitar are not gonna buy that"
42:35;42:36;"I'm sorry"
42:36;42:38;"(Humming)"
42:38;42:40;"(Laughing)"
42:40;42:42;"(Humming)"
42:42;42:43;"Oh man"
42:43;42:44;"Dude"
42:44;42:46;"I'm just shredding up the"
42:46;42:48;"The theme song"
42:48;42:50;"Solo in my house, just blasting"
42:50;42:53;"I met the guy that wrote that theme"
42:53;42:55;"What's his name?"
42:55;42:57;"I think it's Rom"
42:57;42:58;"Ramin?"
42:58;42:59;"I couldn't tell you his last name"
42:59;43:01;"But his name, yeah, is Ramin"
43:01;43:02;"Ramin Djawadi"
43:02;43:03;"Yeah"
43:03;43:04;"He bought a painting of mine"
43:04;43:05;"So you actually met him"
43:05;43:07;"Like he came to the studio?"
43:07;43:08;"Yeah, he came to my studio"
43:08;43:09;"With his wife"
43:09;43:11;"His wife's like, I think more"
43:11;43:12;"The fervent art collector"
43:12;43:14;"Had you seen Game of Thrones at that time?"
43:14;43:16;"Yeah, I'd seen it"
43:16;43:17;"Oh, you know what's kind of funny, man?"
43:17;43:18;"This is random"
43:18;43:19;"I don't know, should I be telling this story?"
43:19;43:20;"Yeah, it's fine"
43:20;43:22;"It's like, they came to my studio"
43:22;43:24;"Because it was set up for the gallery"
43:24;43:26;"She had like, Googled me a bunch"
43:26;43:29;"And she was like, ""So are you in Vampire Weekend?"""
43:29;43:30;"(Laughs)"
43:30;43:34;"And I was like, ""No, no, but I can see your confusion"
43:34;43:37;"I do a radio show with the singer"""
43:37;43:39;"And she's like, ""My husband here, Ramin, is a musician"""
43:39;43:43;"I was like, ""Oh, cool, like, what kind of stuff you do?"""
43:43;43:45;"(Laughs)"
43:45;43:49;"And then, and he was like a very modest, kind of bashful guy"
43:49;43:52;"He's like, ""Yeah, I just, I do, I score stuff"""
43:52;43:54;"And then she was like, ""Have you seen Game of Thrones?"""
43:54;43:55;"Oh, that's cool"
43:55;43:56;"I know, that's cool"
43:56;43:58;"That's cool that he's like, a melody"
43:58;43:59;"Yeah"
43:59;44:02;"Maybe one day, for tax reasons, it might make sense for us"
44:02;44:06;"To kind of just like, merge our corporate identity into one person"
44:06;44:08;"Just one Wikipedia page"
44:08;44:11;"Just like, the host of Time Crisis is"
44:11;44:13;"Jezra, whatever"
44:13;44:16;"Lead singer of Vampire Weekend, American painter"
44:16;44:18;"Host of Time Crisis"
44:18;44:19;"Just keep things simple"
44:19;44:20;"Yeah"
44:20;44:22;"Well, alright, I'm gonna get that guitar"
44:22;44:24;"Just to flex on everybody"
44:24;44:29;"Just to get a wildly overpriced $35,000 Game of Thrones guitar"
44:29;44:30;"Great investment"
44:30;44:32;"That's gonna be my thing for the next album"
45:15;45:17;"You're listening to"
45:17;45:19;"Time Crisis"
45:19;45:22;"Well, Jake, thanks for that great history guitar center"
45:22;45:23;"You're welcome"
45:23;45:25;"A little dry, but, you know, corporate history"
45:25;45:27;"You know, the only reason why it was a little drier"
45:27;45:31;"Than some of your other iconic corporate histories"
45:31;45:34;"Is just because there's not like, that central figure"
45:34;45:37;"Like, there's not like, the Glenn Bell of Taco Bell"
45:37;45:39;"There's not like, the Ray Kroc of the McDonald's Brothers"
45:39;45:41;"There's not the Bill Darden"
45:41;45:43;"Yeah, definitely not the Bill Darden"
45:43;45:45;"Maybe we can just keep this Guitar Center chat going"
45:45;45:48;"We're about to be joined by a long time friend of the show"
45:48;45:49;"Cassie David"
45:49;45:51;"Who just dropped her first book"
45:51;45:53;"It's called No One Asked For This"
45:53;45:55;"Let's see what she has to say about Guitar Center"
45:55;45:59;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
45:59;46:02;"(Phone ringing)"
46:02;46:03;"Hey, what's up Cassie?"
46:03;46:05;"Hey"
46:05;46:07;"Welcome back to Time Crisis"
46:07;46:09;"Thank you so much for having me again"
46:09;46:10;"I'm looking in the notes"
46:10;46:13;"This is your fifth appearance on the show"
46:13;46:14;"Wow, five-timer"
46:14;46:17;"You might be the first five-timer club member"
46:17;46:19;"That would be cool"
46:19;46:20;"I think so"
46:20;46:21;"I was actually thinking about this"
46:21;46:25;"You first came on the show because you and Seinfeld"
46:25;46:29;"Had like, got to be kind of like, Twitter friends"
46:29;46:30;"Is that correct?"
46:30;46:31;"Definitely not Twitter friends"
46:31;46:34;"But we might have DM'd a little bit"
46:34;46:35;"Yeah, I think I just like"
46:35;46:38;"I just thought you'd be a good guest for the show"
46:38;46:44;"I think you came to me asking if we would do like a Seinfeld friends quiz"
46:44;46:46;"Oh right, that was the initial idea"
46:46;46:47;"But I guess my question is"
46:47;46:49;"So Cassie, was Seinfeld on your radar"
46:49;46:52;"Just because of his great Seinfeld related content?"
46:52;46:53;"Yeah"
46:53;46:56;"You knew that he was making the best Seinfeld related content on Twitter"
46:56;46:59;"Yeah, absolutely, absolutely"
46:59;47:04;"I actually, Cassie, I remember reposting your infamous photo of"
47:04;47:06;"It was your dad and you were at"
47:06;47:07;"Yeah, the Civil War"
47:07;47:08;"What was it?"
47:08;47:09;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
47:09;47:11;"In front of a cannon or something like that"
47:11;47:13;"Yeah, it's really made the rounds"
47:13;47:15;"It's become also an alt-right meme"
47:15;47:17;"Which I feel like"
47:17;47:18;"What?"
47:18;47:22;"That's when you know it's just been going on for too long"
47:22;47:26;"The truth is that any meme format will eventually be used by"
47:26;47:28;"Everyone across the political spectrum"
47:28;47:30;"Do you look at things you do before"
47:30;47:33;"And just like make sure they can't be turned into a meme?"
47:33;47:35;"Um, no"
47:35;47:37;"I feel like it's out of one's hand"
47:37;47:39;"I mean there's one meme of me that"
47:39;47:41;"It started with kind of a funny picture"
47:41;47:44;"Where I was kind of like doing a confused look"
47:44;47:46;"I remember doing this photo shoot in France"
47:46;47:48;"And you know, whatever you like doing with photo shoots"
47:48;47:50;"Somebody asks you to do a million different poses"
47:50;47:53;"You can't think about the ramifications of every single one"
47:53;47:55;"It's like whatever"
47:55;47:57;"But it's just like over time with this image"
47:57;47:58;"Somebody flip-flopped it"
47:58;48:00;"The next thing you know it's like"
48:00;48:01;"I was talking about this before"
48:01;48:03;"It's a really kind of very basic meme"
48:03;48:05;"It's just about like anything related to"
48:05;48:07;"Pretending to think about something"
48:07;48:10;"So I still get tagged on it sometimes"
48:10;48:12;"But yeah, the idea that"
48:12;48:14;"That one day there'd be like tags about like"
48:14;48:16;"You know, when you're studying for finals"
48:16;48:18;"But you really, whatever"
48:18;48:20;"I never could have made the connection"
48:20;48:22;"Does it bring you shame?"
48:22;48:24;"It's not one that brings you shame of any kind, is it?"
48:24;48:26;"No, it's just funny and random"
48:26;48:28;"And I get people hitting me up"
48:28;48:30;"Like friends being like"
48:30;48:32;"Oh s***, I saw you in this weird meme"
48:32;48:34;"So what's going on with you?"
48:34;48:36;"You just dropped your book, congratulations"
48:36;48:38;"Yeah, thank you"
48:38;48:40;"In this time I feel like"
48:40;48:42;"Like let me know if you agree"
48:42;48:44;"But I really do feel like you have to just like"
48:44;48:46;"Drop the work and then like run away"
48:46;48:48;"It's like fast as f***"
48:48;48:50;"Because it's so scary out there"
48:50;48:52;"Yeah, I think in general"
48:52;48:54;"I mean I guess the difference between"
48:54;48:56;"A book and an album is"
48:56;48:58;"When you drop an album, even though there is"
48:58;49:00;"A sense of exhaustion and completion"
49:00;49:02;"After you've been working really hard on something"
49:02;49:04;"And you go promote it"
49:04;49:06;"At least in music, then you have to go"
49:06;49:08;"Tour, which"
49:08;49:10;"Often is fun, but it's not that same feeling"
49:10;49:12;"As like well then you just run away"
49:12;49:14;"But I know what you mean, just like"
49:14;49:16;"You just gotta get something out there"
49:16;49:18;"And then see what happens"
49:18;49:20;"No, I just mean like you're just like so scared"
49:20;49:22;"Of what's gonna happen that you just have to like"
49:22;49:24;"Pretend like you just"
49:24;49:26;"Like threw it into a hole and then"
49:26;49:28;"Just like get away from it"
49:28;49:30;"And then just like run away"
49:30;49:32;"And then you just have to like"
49:32;49:34;"Just keep going and keep going"
49:34;49:36;"And then you just have to like"
49:36;49:38;"Keep going and keep going"
49:38;49:40;"And then you just have to like"
49:40;49:42;"Keep going and keep going"
49:42;49:44;"And then you just have to like"
49:44;49:46;"Keep going and keep going"
49:46;49:48;"And then you just have to like"
49:48;49:50;"Keep going and keep going"
49:50;49:52;"And then you just have to like"
49:52;49:54;"Keep going and keep going"
49:54;49:56;"And then you just have to like"
49:56;49:58;"And tell us about the genesis of the book too"
49:58;50:00;"I kind of just wanted to"
50:00;50:02;"Write a book about"
50:02;50:04;"A girl with"
50:04;50:06;"A depression growing up during"
50:06;50:08;"The Instagram generation"
50:08;50:10;"But that's funny, I don't know"
50:10;50:12;"Like of course there's like a lot of"
50:12;50:14;"Books about the protagonist"
50:14;50:16;"Having depression, but"
50:16;50:18;"They're not funny"
50:18;50:20;"And there's a reason for that, but I still"
50:20;50:22;"Yeah, I tried to"
50:22;50:24;"Kind of put a different spin on it"
50:24;50:26;"And that's the genesis"
50:26;50:28;"And all this time have you"
50:28;50:30;"You've been kind of just like posted up at home like doing"
50:30;50:32;"Zoom interviews? Yeah"
50:32;50:34;"Did you do anything in person?"
50:34;50:36;"I did like two interviews"
50:36;50:38;"Like with masks"
50:38;50:40;"Um, I don't know"
50:40;50:42;"How much I prefer that over the zoom"
50:42;50:44;"They're both bad"
50:44;50:46;"But without a mask is bad"
50:46;50:48;"And anyways, so"
50:48;50:50;"You sat like six feet apart from somebody"
50:50;50:52;"A journalist outdoors wearing masks"
50:52;50:54;"Yeah, yeah"
50:54;50:56;"Do you think you would prefer that over"
50:56;50:58;"Like if your face is covered"
50:58;51:00;"Like what personal connection"
51:00;51:02;"Are you really making even"
51:02;51:04;"In person? You can't read their"
51:04;51:06;"Facial expression"
51:06;51:08;"You can't tell if they're smiling"
51:08;51:10;"Right, well you know the eyes are the window"
51:10;51:12;"To the soul, so there's that"
51:12;51:14;"Yeah, I guess it's fine, I mean, you know"
51:14;51:16;"When we do time crisis like we know each other well"
51:16;51:18;"So I'm sure like"
51:18;51:20;"Our brains can fill in any like"
51:20;51:22;"gaps that the FaceTime"
51:22;51:24;"Interface is like leaving out"
51:24;51:26;"And we've had people on the show recently"
51:26;51:28;"That we've never met before"
51:28;51:30;"Nathan Marzy of"
51:30;51:32;"Garfield Eats was on the show"
51:32;51:34;"So yeah, I guess it's like kind of"
51:34;51:36;"Controversial guest"
51:36;51:38;"Well I don't know who that is, is that stupid of me?"
51:38;51:40;"Not stupid of you at all"
51:40;51:42;"No, I'm not gonna say it's stupid of you"
51:42;51:44;"It's a little bit checked out, but I'm not gonna judge you"
51:44;51:46;"For how you live your life"
51:46;51:48;"Well, okay, so you heard about the"
51:48;51:50;"Garfield Eats, the restaurant and the app"
51:50;51:52;"And all that? No"
51:52;51:54;"You know in Toronto there was a Garfield"
51:54;51:56;"Like kind of pizza place"
51:56;51:58;"Did you hear about that? No"
51:58;52:00;"The pizzas are in the shape of Garfield"
52:00;52:02;"Okay"
52:02;52:04;"Well I guess it's kind of a Toronto thing, so"
52:04;52:06;"Long story short, there was a Garfield"
52:06;52:08;"Restaurant in Toronto, it was"
52:08;52:10;"Officially licensed from Jim Davis"
52:10;52:12;"And the guy who started it is Nathan Marzy"
52:12;52:14;"Who's a"
52:14;52:16;"Guy from Quebec, very passionate"
52:16;52:18;"Very ambitious"
52:18;52:20;"And intelligent businessman"
52:20;52:22;"And he kind of basically came to tell us"
52:22;52:24;"About the rise and fall of the"
52:24;52:26;"Restaurant and"
52:26;52:28;"Basically, he, you know"
52:28;52:30;"Similar to what you're saying about creating"
52:30;52:32;"Something, putting it out into the world and then just kind of"
52:32;52:34;"Let it do it's thing and run away"
52:34;52:36;"Except it's hard to do that with a restaurant"
52:36;52:38;"Because everyday is like a fight for survival"
52:38;52:40;"So he had members of the press"
52:40;52:42;"Turn very much against him"
52:42;52:44;"And it kind of became this like controversial"
52:44;52:46;"Restaurant where really what it was was a Garfield"
52:46;52:48;"Themed pizza place"
52:48;52:50;"And he was telling us about getting some"
52:50;52:52;"Really cruel Yelp comments from"
52:52;52:54;"Bugs Bunny fans"
52:54;52:56;"Things of that nature, so he was like really in the thick of it"
52:56;52:58;"Anyway"
52:58;53:00;"It had recently closed because of a dispute with"
53:00;53:02;"The landlord and we had him on the show"
53:02;53:04;"And he kind of told us the whole saga"
53:04;53:06;"I guess Jake, you were saying"
53:06;53:08;"He was a controversial guest"
53:08;53:10;"Based on some feedback that you were getting"
53:10;53:12;"Yeah, I mean, friends, you know"
53:12;53:14;"People that I know that listen to the show"
53:14;53:16;"A friend of the show, Aaron Olson, said that was the"
53:16;53:18;"Worst guest we've ever had"
53:18;53:20;"And then I feel like Seinfeld"
53:20;53:22;"Sent some screenshots of the"
53:22;53:24;"Time Crisis Reddit, sorry Kazzy, we're just going"
53:24;53:26;"No, I'm sorry"
53:26;53:28;"I'm just so glad it's not me"
53:28;53:30;"Yeah, we're going off on a"
53:30;53:34;"It seemed like on the Time Crisis Reddit"
53:34;53:36;"It was divisive"
53:36;53:38;"To say the least"
53:38;53:40;"You guys kind of have an obsession with these weird"
53:40;53:42;"Foods, like every time I'm on"
53:42;53:44;"We're talking about like a"
53:44;53:46;"There was like the Fritos thing last time"
53:46;53:48;"Yep, I mean it's kind of a"
53:48;53:50;"You guys do the Starbucks guy"
53:50;53:52;"Winter's a beloved guest on the show"
53:52;53:54;"Well basically, here's the thing"
53:54;53:56;"To contextualize it"
53:56;53:58;"This guy, his restaurant had just closed"
53:58;54:00;"So I think he's"
54:00;54:02;"Coming here to do some press and he's probably got so much"
54:02;54:04;"Sh*t on his mind, he's probably stressed out"
54:04;54:06;"He probably feels like he's fighting for his life"
54:06;54:08;"A little bit, he's just been through the ringer"
54:08;54:10;"With these f*gs bunny fans"
54:10;54:12;"And you know"
54:12;54:14;"Mean spirited journalists and stuff"
54:14;54:16;"So yeah, I can imagine that like"
54:16;54:18;"He came in bringing a lot of"
54:18;54:20;"Energy and maybe it wasn't"
54:20;54:22;"Quite as laid back as people might"
54:22;54:24;"Have been expecting, just listen to"
54:24;54:26;"Me and Jake, you know, shoot the sh*t"
54:26;54:28;"About the Grateful Dead and Home Depot"
54:28;54:30;"You know, he was fired up"
54:30;54:32;"So I can imagine his energy wasn't what some people"
54:32;54:34;"Were expecting but"
54:34;54:36;"I'm actually very curious to learn more about him"
54:36;54:38;"He's obviously not media"
54:38;54:40;"Trained, you know"
54:40;54:42;"And was not in a good place"
54:42;54:44;"I think that's definitely possible"
54:44;54:46;"He was the most like"
54:46;54:48;"High energy guest we've had since"
54:48;54:50;"I wanna say James Corden"
54:50;54:52;"I forgot"
54:52;54:54;"James Corden was on the show"
54:54;54:56;"But he was also pretty high energy"
54:56;54:58;"Oh yeah, T-Pain was a great guest"
54:58;55:00;"Oh yeah, he was tight though"
55:00;55:02;"Broke up with my girl last night"
55:02;55:04;"So I went to the club"
55:04;55:06;"Put on a fresh white suit"
55:06;55:08;"And a mini-coupe sitting on dubs"
55:08;55:10;"I'm just looking for"
55:10;55:12;"Somebody to talk to and show me some love"
55:12;55:14;"If you know"
55:14;55:16;"What I mean"
55:16;55:20;"Everybody tracking me"
55:20;55:22;"As soon as I stepped in the spot"
55:22;55:24;"200 fish days in the building"
55:24;55:26;"Ain't none of them hot"
55:26;55:28;"Except for this pretty young"
55:28;55:30;"Thing that was working all the way at the top"
55:30;55:32;"All the way at the top"
55:32;55:34;"Shouting what is her name"
55:34;55:36;"Ooh, she made us drinks"
55:36;55:38;"To drink"
55:38;55:40;"We drunk and me got drunk"
55:40;55:42;"And man I think she thinks"
55:42;55:44;"I'm cool"
55:44;55:46;"She gave me a wink"
55:46;55:48;"I winked back"
55:48;55:50;"And man I think that"
55:50;55:52;"We hit it off something proper"
55:52;55:54;"Like"
55:54;55:56;"Like a bartender"
55:56;55:58;"Ooh, if you're looking for me"
55:58;56:00;"I'm at the bar"
56:00;56:02;"With her"
56:02;56:04;"I like the bartender"
56:04;56:06;"If you're looking for me"
56:06;56:08;"I'm at the bar"
56:08;56:10;"With her"
56:10;56:12;"Okay"
56:12;56:14;"You might get complaints"
56:14;56:16;"That I'm too low energy"
56:16;56:18;"Well, I think that's why you fit in on this show"
56:18;56:20;"You kind of operate at a lower frequency"
56:20;56:22;"But I like mixing things up"
56:22;56:24;"Get somebody fired up every now and then"
56:24;56:26;"Keeps people on their toes"
56:26;56:28;"And I bet when things are divisive"
56:28;56:30;"I mean Garfield eats the restaurant"
56:30;56:32;"Was divisive, clearly"
56:32;56:34;"Everything's divisive now"
56:34;56:36;"They could find something wrong with anything"
56:36;56:38;"That is true, I think you're right"
56:38;56:40;"That the internet"
56:40;56:42;"Can make everything seem divisive"
56:42;56:44;"Even things that aren't particularly divisive"
56:44;56:46;"Right"
56:46;56:48;"My favorite thing I saw this week"
56:48;56:50;"Was that a bunch of like"
56:50;56:52;"Gay guys on TikTok"
56:52;56:54;"Were making fun of girls"
56:54;56:56;"Who wear black skinny jeans"
56:56;56:58;"And jean jackets"
56:58;57:00;"And they were like, this is the most basic thing ever"
57:00;57:02;"Blah blah blah"
57:02;57:04;"So they were making fun of like jean jackets"
57:04;57:06;"Which you wouldn't think is possible"
57:06;57:08;"And then a bunch of people came out"
57:08;57:10;"And started making fun of those guys"
57:10;57:12;"Doing that and calling it internalized misogyny"
57:12;57:14;"And that you can't tell women what to wear"
57:14;57:16;"And they're not dressing for you"
57:16;57:18;"And then it was like, it's just like a"
57:18;57:20;"Spiral of people making fun of people"
57:20;57:22;"It's very weird"
57:22;57:24;"Especially for like"
57:24;57:26;"That most of it's like everyone's"
57:26;57:28;"Offended and like"
57:28;57:30;"Nothing's like woken up"
57:30;57:32;"And then they're actually like so mean"
57:32;57:34;"In basically in support of"
57:34;57:36;"Like these causes"
57:36;57:38;"That's been my realization the last day"
57:38;57:40;"Kazzy, have you ever watched"
57:40;57:42;"This is a thing we recommend"
57:42;57:44;"To every Time Crisis guest"
57:44;57:46;"Have you ever watched Hypernormalization"
57:46;57:48;"By Adam Curtis"
57:48;57:50;"No"
57:50;57:52;"This is a documentary, a lot of things make a similar point"
57:52;57:54;"But yeah of course we kind of live in echo chambers"
57:54;57:56;"The more fired up"
57:56;57:58;"People get, the more time people will spend"
57:58;58:00;"Like fighting"
58:00;58:02;"On the internet rather than"
58:02;58:04;"You know, just chilling out with their friend"
58:04;58:06;"Cracking a brew"
58:06;58:08;"I guess I have a problem"
58:08;58:10;"Getting fired up about like"
58:10;58:12;"People being fired up on the internet"
58:12;58:14;"Energy is contagious"
58:14;58:16;"You read a harsh comment about"
58:16;58:18;"Your Garfield Pizzeria online"
58:18;58:20;"Now you're bringing"
58:20;58:22;"Kind of intense energy"
58:22;58:24;"And then you come on our show, you got a lot of shit on your mind"
58:24;58:26;"Understandably"
58:26;58:28;"And then you're coming in high energy"
58:28;58:30;"You're passionate"
58:30;58:32;"And then you got a TC head"
58:32;58:34;"Who's waiting for Bob Weir"
58:34;58:36;"Iconic hippie"
58:36;58:38;"Meditator kind of chill"
58:38;58:40;"Dude, Birkenstock wearer"
58:40;58:42;"Like you're waiting for him to come on"
58:42;58:44;"You're like whoa this guy's bringing a lot of energy"
58:44;58:46;"I'm harshed out"
58:46;58:48;"And then you're getting on the time crisis"
58:48;58:50;"Reddit"
58:50;58:52;"And you're being like whoa I'm harshed out"
58:52;58:54;"People, I'm not feeling this guest"
58:54;58:56;"And then somebody else is like well f*** you"
58:56;58:58;"I like him"
58:58;59:00;"And then now Seinfeld's sending us screenshots"
59:00;59:02;"Being like whoa the community's being torn apart"
59:02;59:04;"Now I'm f***ing stressed out"
59:04;59:06;"And then like you know I'm like"
59:06;59:08;"Snapping at my friends"
59:08;59:10;"And then you know like that's how it works"
59:10;59:12;"Energy is truly contagious"
59:12;59:14;"That's enough about Garfield Eats"
59:14;59:16;"For now"
59:16;59:18;"Kazzy have you ever been to Guitar Center?"
59:18;59:20;"No I haven't"
59:20;59:22;"Do you play guitar?"
59:22;59:24;"No. I took lessons when I was younger"
59:24;59:26;"And it hurt my fingers"
59:26;59:28;"And I truly despised it"
59:28;59:30;"I hated the feeling on my fingers"
59:30;59:32;"That is a very important thing with instruments"
59:32;59:34;"Are you into like the"
59:34;59:36;"Basic rudiments of how it feels"
59:36;59:38;"Of course there's like a hump you can get over"
59:38;59:40;"But I always had this issue with saxophone"
59:40;59:42;"I think I'm a solid saxophonist"
59:42;59:44;"Maybe I could have been a very good one"
59:44;59:46;"I'm not going to say great"
59:46;59:48;"Maybe I could have been very good"
59:48;59:50;"But the proper armature"
59:50;59:52;"The way you fit your mouth around a sax"
59:52;59:54;"You have to put your teeth right on the mouthpiece"
59:54;59:56;"And you can feel it vibrate a little bit"
59:56;59:58;"And just like I don't know"
59:58;01:00:00;"Like a lot of people my teeth are kind of sensitive"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"And so I would always kind of curl my lip around it"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"And then my teacher would be like"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You're never going to be a sick saxophonist"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"I feel like you said like you've got decent lyricism"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"But you're never going to have the tone"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"If you keep curling your lip around it"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"And I was like I couldn't get over it"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"I don't like that feeling"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Do you know what's so gross about the saxophone?"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Doesn't it have a spit valve?"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"A saxophone does have a little spit valve"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I mean to me the instrument I associate the most"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"With like a spit valve is a trombone"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"That's like true gnarly"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Is like a trombonist who's just been like"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"F***ing wailing on that thing all day"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"And then just like"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"A quart of just saliva coming out"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"A saxophone can fill up with"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"A saliva little bit"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"It's not the same as a brass instrument"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"What made you want to play guitar in the first place?"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Kazzy, why did you pick that of all instruments?"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"It was just like I was young"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"And my parents were desperate"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"To find me a passion"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"So I tried a lot of different things"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"All of which I hated"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"But there was really something about the vibration"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Of the strings"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Like that made my hands feel like"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Numb and tingly"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"And I just, yeah"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"I lasted like two lessons"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"So do you have an acoustic guitar?"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"I can picture like playing an acoustic guitar"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Early days and like it feeling like"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"Your wrist hurts"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Fingers feel weird"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Guitars are cool though"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"I like that they come in different colors"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"Yeah I think they're cool looking"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"They're like cars"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yeah and actually a lot of the same"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"People collect both of them"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"I actually have a question for you too"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"I don't know if this has ever come up on the show"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"But I know that you're friends"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"With John Mayer"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And I noticed this because"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"I received a gift package"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"When your book came out"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"Full disclosure I haven't been able to go deep on the book yet"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"Good, just don't even"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"It's not like I've been reading anything else"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"You know I've just been"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"Living my life the past few weeks"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"But I have worn the shirt twice"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Really?"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Yes, because you put together"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"This really thoughtful package that you sent out"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"To people, the book looks great, I love the design"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"And then you have this great shirt"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"That it's kind of like"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Has a lot of like the book information"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Like the ISDN number"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"And it's also like a really interesting color that you chose"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"It's like a very light green"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"It's very soft"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Yeah"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"So I was like super psyched to receive the book"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"And the shirt and then I saw"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"That you posted on Instagram that that shirt"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Was designed by none other than"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Dead & Co. guitarist John Mayer"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Yeah"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"So how did that come about?"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"He loves designing merch"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"I thought it would be cool if he did it"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And he's really good at it"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"So is he like getting it in Photoshop?"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"He's like put me in touch"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"He worked with a designer who did some Dead & Co. stuff"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"And I think they worked on it together"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"But yeah"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Does that make you like the shirt"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Any less or more or what do you think?"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"I like the shirt the same amount"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"Honestly it makes me more impressed"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"With John Mayer's graphic design skill"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Yeah"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"I thought that was a great shirt and I was like oh okay"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"He's pretty good at everything"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"But it is like the material of the shirt"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Is really nice"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"It's like very soft and you know"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"It gets better with every wash"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"So you're probably on wash like maybe two"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"Maybe you don't wash your shirts that much"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"I always wash it before I wore it outside"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"A second time"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"That shirt's probably been washed twice"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"It's a beautiful shirt"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"I think you should sell that shirt honestly"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"I'm working on it, we're trying"
01:03:32;01:03:42;"Condescendingly, take a seat Take your life, plot it out in black and white"
01:03:42;01:03:48;"I never lived the dream of the primekings and the drama queens"
01:03:48;01:03:57;"I'd like to think the best of me is still hiding up my sleeve"
01:03:57;01:04:05;"I'd love to tell you stay inside the lines"
01:04:05;01:04:16;"But something's better on the other side"
01:04:16;01:04:21;"I wanna run through the halls of the high school"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"I wanna scream at the top of my lungs"
01:04:24;01:04:28;"I just found out there's no such thing as the real world"
01:04:28;01:04:32;"Just a light, you've got to rise above"
01:04:32;01:04:38;"Now knowing that you and John Mayer are not just friends, you're collaborators, you've created merch items together"
01:04:38;01:04:43;"Something that's never come up on this show before, which is interesting, given that you've been on many times"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"Have you been to a Dead & Co. show?"
01:04:45;01:04:46;"Yeah, I have"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"Really? Did you go to Dodger Stadium?"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"No, was it Hollywood Bowl?"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Oh yeah"
01:04:52;01:04:59;"I went to that one and they were like four songs in and I was like, why haven't they done another, a new song?"
01:04:59;01:05:04;"I thought it had been one song, because they all sounded the same"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"You're getting some Deadheads upset with me right now"
01:05:07;01:05:12;"So your familiarity with the music of the Grateful Dead was low?"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"Yeah, it was quite low"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"You were low information"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"I'm an opposer, though, I'll wear the shirt"
01:05:16;01:05:23;"But it was an experience, everyone was trying to be friends with each other and sharing stuff"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"It definitely was a community of people"
01:05:25;01:05:31;"I don't think you're an opposer at all for A, going to actually check out a show"
01:05:31;01:05:40;"I guess you could say there's something opposer-ish about, even then, let people live, but about just being into the shirt"
01:05:40;01:05:45;"The shirt's getting borderline, very much too mainstream"
01:05:45;01:05:50;"But I think there's something different about me ordering a Dead shirt and then me being given one"
01:05:50;01:05:55;"But also, I'm saying, you went to the show because you're friends with somebody in the band"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"You had a real reason to go and check it out"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Did you do any research before you rolled up?"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"You know, I didn't"
01:06:03;01:06:06;"You want to experience it totally raw"
01:06:06;01:06:10;"I talked to a Deadhead who'd been to like a hundred shows in their life"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"One is not enough, they just go to them"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Can you explain that to me?"
01:06:14;01:06:20;"They go to like 50 shows, follow them around"
01:06:20;01:06:26;"The simplest explanation is A, you have fans of any type of artist who might go to a lot of shows, any type of music"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"But it's different"
01:06:27;01:06:33;"Specifically with the Grateful Dead and then also Dead & Co, setlist is different every night"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"Often no repeats one night to the next"
01:06:36;01:06:40;"I could argue that there were a lot of, it sounded like a lot of repeats"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"No, I'm kidding"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"You might get in trouble for that one"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Maybe the tide is turning"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"You might have a few people now being like, ""I'm kidding you guys"""
01:06:49;01:06:53;"But here's the truth, I bet even on a neurological level"
01:06:53;01:06:57;"Music that you're not that familiar with does sound the same"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Like when you roll to a show"
01:06:59;01:07:03;"I guarantee that you go talk to your Deadhead friend who's seen like a hundred Dead shows"
01:07:03;01:07:09;"And you were like, ""Let's roll to like, I don't know, the Ariana Grande show"""
01:07:09;01:07:14;"If they're not familiar with the type of music, people tend to walk around being like, ""All this sh*t sounds the same"""
01:07:14;01:07:16;"I don't think it's necessarily pejorative"
01:07:16;01:07:21;"I've been to shows too where I was kind of like, I couldn't keep track of what's going on because"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Yeah, I think you're right"
01:07:22;01:07:27;"And it's the same for maybe like comedy for someone else"
01:07:27;01:07:32;"Like, ""Oh, this is the same sh*t, more sh*t jokes"""
01:07:32;01:07:35;"Right, even dare I say it, I can kind of picture"
01:07:35;01:07:40;"Maybe I've even seen like a Seinfeld hater who's just like, ""This show's about nothing, why do I care?"""
01:07:40;01:07:46;"Every episode it's like similar hijinks and then like, you know, Seinfeld 2000 is like, ""Hold me back"""
01:07:46;01:07:48;"""I want to deck this person"""
01:07:48;01:07:50;"That's the whole point"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"If you haven't been initiated into something, it can feel very samey and confusing"
01:07:54;01:07:59;"But yeah, I think like, as I'm sure you've probably discussed here and there with John Mayer"
01:07:59;01:08:03;"It's like, he's playing different solos in the style of Jerry Garcia"
01:08:03;01:08:07;"So every version of the song is going to be different"
01:08:07;01:08:13;"And if you're like, familiar with the different versions of the song and where it's gone and how it morphed and stuff"
01:08:13;01:08:20;"You're going to appreciate those differences and you're going to be following with rapt attention to see where the band goes and where the solo goes"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"So, you know, and then I'm sure that I'm talking about"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"I mean, watching them was incredible"
01:08:24;01:08:27;"Like, it was, the watching was amazing"
01:08:27;01:08:31;"It was just the listening that obviously like, I don't know enough about"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"You're keeping it real and I respect that"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"But you did have a good time at the show, you enjoyed the vibe"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"It was great"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"You made it through the whole show"
01:08:38;01:08:39;"Yeah"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"So then I got to ask, just because he was just on the show"
01:08:41;01:08:46;"Did you go backstage and talk to like, Bob Weir for instance?"
01:08:46;01:08:50;"I think I didn't, but I did meet him after"
01:08:50;01:08:53;"But I don't think I went backstage and met all of them"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Oh, maybe you had some other moment, you met them"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Mm-hmm"
01:08:56;01:08:59;"So would you go to another show when COVID's over?"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Definitely"
01:09:00;01:09:05;"Do you have like a favorite song or you're still just kind of like, I'm not really familiar with music"
01:09:05;01:09:11;"I feel like it would be weird if I, I think like you would be able to judge me too hard if I just like said my favorite song, you know?"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"But I'm just saying, do you even have one?"
01:09:13;01:09:17;"Or you're, again, not judging, if your vibe is like, I'm tight with the guitarist"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Like Jake, I'm sure you have some friends"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"Actually, now I'm curious about this"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Jake, do you have any like friends?"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Because like Hannah likes the Dead, right?"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Yeah"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"She went to the Dodger Stadium show"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"Mm-hmm"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"With her own group of friends"
01:09:29;01:09:36;"But like, you must have some friends or acquaintances who've come to check out the Richard Pictures show just because they're friends with you"
01:09:36;01:09:43;"And they maybe like don't really know the music and don't have much to say about it, right?"
01:09:43;01:09:47;"I mean, first and foremost, Uncle Ted hates the Dead"
01:09:47;01:09:50;"Whoa, Uncle Ted hates the Dead? I didn't know this"
01:09:50;01:09:58;"Ted will be in the back courtyard of the Old Town Pub drunk talking about how he loves Frank Zappa, but he thinks Jerry Garcia sucks"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Whoa"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"So, you know"
01:10:00;01:10:07;"I mean, there aren't that many bands that I can think of that actually can even bring the haters and the fans together like that"
01:10:07;01:10:12;"There's a sense of community and there's like a fun vibe, so it's like you roll up either way"
01:10:12;01:10:18;"I think it's interesting how like all, most fans like look, you know, they all had like a similar look"
01:10:18;01:10:22;"They all had a similar vibe and like personality"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"I enjoyed that"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"But did you wear your Grateful Dead shirt to the show?"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"No, no, I can't do that"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"That's too much"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Respect"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"All right, fair enough"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"You went and hung out at the show?"
01:10:34;01:10:40;"Red and white, boots with shoes"
01:10:40;01:10:47;"Well, I'm Michael Sand, how do you do?"
01:10:47;01:10:54;"Give me five, it's too much"
01:10:54;01:11:02;"Ain't no luck, no luck"
01:11:03;01:11:12;"Big man pull, it don't change"
01:11:12;01:11:20;"Stay seven inches, come shine the rain"
01:11:20;01:11:27;"Wave your flag, my body bag"
01:11:27;01:11:34;"Ride the rainbow, you're standing tall"
01:11:34;01:11:38;"Can I just chime in with a time crisis clarification?"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Please"
01:11:39;01:11:43;"This is actually Kazzy David's sixth appearance on the show"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"What?"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"You are just above Jonah Hill as far as appearances"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Jonah Hill has been on the show five times"
01:11:51;01:11:54;"Mero from Desus and Mero has been on five times as has Baio"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"Kazzy, you're now tied with Winter, the Starbucks guy"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"Wait, oh, wait, wait"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"Baio's been on five times?"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"I don't buy these numbers"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"I trust the source"
01:12:05;01:12:10;"Do you think that's just because I have like the most time on my hands out of all those people?"
01:12:10;01:12:14;"I mean, actually, we did try to get Winter for this episode"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"And he was too busy"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Although it was not"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I got to tie him"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"It wasn't like we were going for Winter and then Winter bailed"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"And we were just like, there's always Kazzy"
01:12:25;01:12:31;"We wanted to have you and Winter on the same episode because you're both classic TC guests"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"That was the thinking"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Wait, so something's wrong"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Kazzy and Winter have both been on six times"
01:12:36;01:12:41;"And then Jonah, Mero and Baio are tied for five"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Correct"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Ariel has also been on the show six times"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"I'm not buying numbers"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"These numbers are wrong"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"I'm sorry"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"I can believe that Baio was on five times"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Ariel on six times"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"I can picture Ariel being on three times off the top of my head"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"I can only picture Baio three times"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"There was the hot sauce challenge"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"Did he ever call in?"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"Did he call in about Shaggy and the sting?"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"Yes, that was one"
01:13:09;01:13:12;"I mean, this is coming from the Apple Music database"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Which I trust wholeheartedly"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Remember when we all met Tim Cook?"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Oh yeah"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"I totally forgot about that"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"Wait, and Tim Cook did not get on mic, right?"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"No, you can't consider him a guest of the show"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"But he is a fan of the show"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Fan of the show"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Patron of the show"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"But not a guest of the show"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Really the CEO of the show"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"If it really comes down to it"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"Technically Tim Cook is the CEO of Time Crisis"
01:13:43;01:13:48;"Time Crisis is a bi-weekly American internet radio show"
01:13:48;01:13:53;"Co-hosted by Jake Longstreth and Ezra Koenig"
01:13:53;01:13:56;"Tim Cook currently serves as CEO"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"Alright"
01:13:57;01:14:01;"Well I think when we did the Time Crisis IPO a couple years ago"
01:14:01;01:14:05;"He had to be the CEO by default"
01:14:05;01:14:09;"Any guesses as to who the number one most frequent guest on the show is?"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"It's above Kazzy and Winter?"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Way above"
01:14:13;01:14:16;"And this is not some gotcha thing where it's like it's you?"
01:14:16;01:14:19;"Wait, his name is Seinfeld too"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Oh sh*t"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"It was you"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Damn"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"My worry is that, if we're being honest"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"My worry this whole time is that Seinfeld is going to say"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"That it's Deathspot"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"And that Deathspot is going to get mad"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"And that Deathspot is going to get mad because he's not a guest of the show"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Deathspot is technically a co-host of the show"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"Exactly"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"Of course Deathspot is core Crisis crew"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Core life, foundational"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"There's no debate"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"With nine appearances on the show"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"Rashida Jones"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"Oh"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"Deserved"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"You know what, that makes sense actually"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Because in the early days of Time Crisis"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"It's like funny that when we started Time Crisis"
01:14:56;01:15:00;"There was like, we're trying to have like segments and stuff"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"And Rashida had so many great stories"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"That at least in three or four episodes"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"We were just kind of like cut to"
01:15:06;01:15:10;"Me asking Rashida to tell like a fun story from growing up"
01:15:10;01:15:16;"Like her iconic story about getting bit by Michael Jackson's chimp bubbles"
01:15:16;01:15:20;"Okay, so yeah, a bunch of them were like those little story segments"
01:15:20;01:15:23;"And then of course she's been an actual guest as well"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"Wow"
01:15:24;01:15:28;"She hasn't been on in like a solid four years"
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Well you know what's funny Dick"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"I was thinking about it recently"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"I was actually"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"No, Rashida was on in quarantine"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"What are you talking about?"
01:15:34;01:15:38;"She stopped by when we were talking about NSYNC"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Okay"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"The funny thing is Jake, actually"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"I was thinking about it when you had your wife on the show"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Yeah"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Not that long ago"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"Yeah"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"And talked about her new show Teacher on FX"
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Hope you're watching"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"But then I was like, oh I should have Rashida on the show"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"I was actually gonna, after this episode"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"I was gonna pitch her"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"When we have our board meeting"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"We have a big board meeting of the core Crisis crew"
01:16:03;01:16:06;"We get a big thing of Einstein bagels"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"We kind of meet down in Culver City"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Actually when you think about it"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"It doesn't make sense that we do the show remotely"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"But we still go in person"
01:16:14;01:16:18;"With no social distancing and no masks for the board meeting"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"But you know, Tim Cook flies down from Cupertino"
01:16:20;01:16:21;"So it's a whole thing"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"Anyway, I was gonna pitch at the next board meeting"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"And I actually haven't asked her yet"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"But maybe Rashida should come on the next episode"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Which is the last episode of the year"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"She should do some promo for On the Rocks"
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Right"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"Yeah, I mean we should have her back"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"But now actually, here I'm the middle man"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"I gotta go pitch it to Tim Cook next week"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"But I also gotta go pitch it to Rashida"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"When I go upstairs after the show"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"And I'll just say"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"Babe, I got some incredible news"
01:16:48;01:16:52;"Seinfeld did the most amazing number crunch tonight"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"And I'm very proud to tell you something"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"Who do you think is our most frequent guest?"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"She'll be like, I don't know, Winter, Kazzy"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Babe, it's you"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Oh damn, it was you!"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"Wait a second"
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Her name was Rashida too"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"I'll do"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"I'm just gonna present the whole thing as a rap"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"We had a guest on TC so much"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Her name was Rashida too"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"Wait, it was you"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Damn"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Kazzy, you're a big Eminem fan, right?"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"Yeah"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"Would you say that Stan is like his best song?"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"No"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"What's the number one Eminem song?"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"Lose Yourself? Is that stupid?"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"That's in some ways his most famous song"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"I feel like that's his most famous song"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Academy Award winning, Lose Yourself"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Like, have you listened to his last album, Front to Back?"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Yeah, I have"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"That came out during quarantine, right?"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Um, yes"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Music to be Murdered By?"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"So Music to be"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"The night Music to be Murdered By drops"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"You're just like, throw it on your AirPods"
01:17:56;01:18:00;"Lay back on your bed to see like, what does Marshall have to say this time?"
01:18:00;01:18:03;"Yeah, I listened to it, Front to Back"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"I think there were two hits for me"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"Yeah, does Eminem kind of like, always bring it?"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Like, assuming that you like Eminem"
01:18:11;01:18:14;"I mean, it's like the kind of thing where it's like"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"He's really easy to be like, he sucks now, blah blah blah"
01:18:17;01:18:22;"Like, he's still Eminem, like still doing amazing things"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"Like, he doesn't actually suck now"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Do you miss like, you know, there was a time when Eminem"
01:18:27;01:18:32;"His first single from each album would be like a very like, circusy beat"
01:18:32;01:18:35;"And he'd always be disrespecting celebrities"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"And that was like his formula for like, multiple albums"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"And then he got away from that"
01:18:39;01:18:44;"Do you miss that like, humorous side of Eminem where he would wear wigs and"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"You know, pretend to be"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Yeah, but he's angry, he's angry"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"Everyone's sh*t on him"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"So he doesn't, probably doesn't feel like being funny"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Like, he's probably really mad"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"And this is what you get, you guys"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"Maybe if you came around"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"No, I like Eminem"
01:18:58;01:19:01;"And in fact, now that we're talking about him"
01:19:01;01:19:05;"I'm gonna go listen to music to be murdered by tonight"
01:19:05;01:19:10;"And actually, I've always thought Eminem's a fascinating person"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"And obviously, extremely talented artist"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"And actually, he still puts up numbers"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"It's like, people really still listen to Eminem"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"It's not like some sh*t where it's like, oh yeah, Eminem"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I listened to that back in the early 2000s"
01:19:23;01:19:26;"But I'm not one of those freaks who still keeps up"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"No, he's like our AC/DC"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"He's like a career artist"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"He's got a huge number of fans"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"People even gave him credit that maybe he helped Joe Biden win Michigan"
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Yeah, that's amazing"
01:19:38;01:19:42;"People sh*t on Kamikaze, it was like, pretty good"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"It's just like, you can't"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"That was the one before"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Yeah"
01:19:45;01:19:50;"He's actually more relevant than probably almost any other musician who's his age"
01:19:50;01:19:55;"I think we need to stop sh*tting on Eminem so he can be funny again"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Although, be careful what you wish for, Kazzy"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"Because now you're out there doing press tours now"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"Number two best-selling New York Times book"
01:20:03;01:20:07;"You're officially fair game for the mind of Marshall Mathers"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"I think we relate to each other"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"We both need everyone"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Kazzy David"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"And Kazzy David, you can"
01:20:17;01:20:21;"What rhymes with David? Eminem would figure it out"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"It would be an honor"
01:20:23;01:20:27;"I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I feel like Godzilla"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Better hit the deck like Zacardzilla"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"My whole squad's in here walking around the party"
01:20:31;01:20:34;"A cross between a zombie, a pocket of Simba Bobby"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"The brain meaning which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Shave these in the sh*t, I'm posse"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"Consider it to cost me a costly mistake if they sleeping on me"
01:20:42;01:20:47;"Better get insomnia, ADHD, hydroxycut, test the capacity"
01:20:47;01:20:50;"In AA with an AK, melee finish that hit like a playdate"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"Better vacate, retreat like a vacay Mayday"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"This beat is cray cray, ray jay, h-a-h-a-h-a"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames, they cannot tame or placate the"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"Monster, you get in my way, I'ma feed you to the"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Monster, I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a"
01:21:03;01:21:06;"Monster, when the moon shines like Ice World trucker"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"I look like a villain out of those blockbusters"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Godzilla, fire spitter, monster"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"Blood on the dance floor, the Louis V carpet"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"Fire, Godzilla, fire monster"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Blood on the dance floor"
01:21:19;01:21:26;"I'd like to ask Kazzy something, since she brought up that she only, you know, when we've had her on are always bringing up food"
01:21:26;01:21:33;"And today was this, I mean, I think, sort of surprising collaboration between Lady Gaga and Oreos"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"Oh, good point"
01:21:35;01:21:41;"So, it is, the timing's good and it's something we've brought up, you know, collaborations, food collaborations"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"With Kazzy, I'd love to know"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"Yeah, it's like, for kindness, right?"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Like, that'll help"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"What?"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"The Oreos for kindness?"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"Kazzy, I sent you this article, I didn't even read it, but I did see it"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"Oh, I read it"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Okay, thank you"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Okay, you know what, this is"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Thank you"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"I f***ing studied for this"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Okay"
01:22:00;01:22:07;"Now we're turning over to TC correspondent Kazzy David for an in-depth report on Lady Gaga's new Oreo"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Break it down for us, what's this all about?"
01:22:09;01:22:17;"They're to spread awareness for kindness, and you basically go to like oreo.com or something"
01:22:17;01:22:22;"And you say something that's like kind in a recorder and then they make it into a song"
01:22:22;01:22:27;"And it's to spread kindness, and they're pink and green"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"Clearly the word kind is like getting a little too out there"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"Kindness doesn't need awareness, like we're all aware of it, you know?"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"You use awareness for something people don't really know about, am I wrong?"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"I'm just even more confused now"
01:22:39;01:22:44;"Here's one thing that I know because I follow, I think it's called Candy Hunting"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"I've referenced it on the show before"
01:22:46;01:22:51;"I've now dipped my toes a little bit into snack and candy Instagram"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"Because as a member of the Kit Kat Flavor Club, I'm a candy influencer"
01:22:55;01:23:01;"And it keeps me abreast of new collabs and new items"
01:23:01;01:23:08;"For instance, I recently learned about a special Christmas macchiato that Duncan is doing"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Called the Sugar Plum Macchiato"
01:23:10;01:23:15;"But after I was made aware of the Lady Gaga Oreos via the TC thread"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"I also saw it on Instagram via Candy Hunting"
01:23:18;01:23:25;"And they were explaining to their followers that the Lady Gaga Oreo"
01:23:25;01:23:29;"Even though it's pink and green on the inside, I think"
01:23:29;01:23:33;"It tastes not like a normal Oreo"
01:23:33;01:23:38;"Because the classic chocolate, vanilla, whatever Oreo that we all know"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Is not what it's based on"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"It tastes like a classic golden Oreo"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"Which I guess is a thing that they've been making forever"
01:23:45;01:23:49;"Which is, you know, the cookie is like tan"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Vanilla"
01:23:50;01:23:53;"So anybody who's ever had a golden Oreo, that's what it's going to taste like"
01:23:53;01:23:57;"Also you get with the Lady Gaga Oreos"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"I think there's something, if you do it"
01:24:00;01:24:05;"You might win tickets or a meet and greet post-COVID"
01:24:05;01:24:06;"Pending"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"They're specific, pending COVID restrictions"
01:24:09;01:24:15;"So is the money from the sales of these Oreos going to some charitable cause?"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"Or is it just, you know, be kind?"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"It doesn't look like it, Jake, but"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"You've got to be kidding me, there's no charitable element?"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"I didn't see anything about it"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I just saw kindness awareness"
01:24:27;01:24:32;"According to, yes, according to the press release"
01:24:32;01:24:36;"The cookie is to spread musical messages of kindness throughout the country"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"With a ""Sing it with Oreo"" campaign"
01:24:39;01:24:43;"That encourages fans to send musical messages to loved ones"
01:24:43;01:24:49;"For a chance to win an assortment of swag and experiences"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"I think I understand this now"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"This whole thing about the singing is very confusing"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"But basically, there doesn't need to be a charitable element"
01:24:56;01:25:01;"Because the whole contest, the whole campaign"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Is the charity"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"It's charitable"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"It is charitable because"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"They're not just saying some vague sh*t about like"
01:25:08;01:25:11;"Buy this cookie and you're spreading kindness"
01:25:11;01:25:15;"They're creating a whole contest that facilitates kindness"
01:25:15;01:25:19;"By making people sing songs to their relatives"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Which, let's face it, folks"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"In our disconnected, atomized world"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"It was bad enough with just the internet"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"Now with COVID, things have really gone haywire"
01:25:29;01:25:32;"There probably are a lot of people out there"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"Who aren't checking in on their loved ones enough"
01:25:35;01:25:40;"And maybe their intentions are not 100% pure"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"They're only singing the song to grandma"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"Because they want the Lady Gaga tickets post-COVID"
01:25:45;01:25:50;"But still, this campaign is actually facilitating connections"
01:25:50;01:25:51;"Between people"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"So, I just want to be super clear"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"You video yourself singing a song"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"No, you send it to Oreo without singing it"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"And then they turn it into a song"
01:26:01;01:26:05;"So like using sophisticated musical algorithms"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"Or they hired a bunch of like Attaway musicians"
01:26:08;01:26:12;"And were just like, ""Hey, craft a little demo out of this"""
01:26:12;01:26:14;"So this is original material"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"No, I think Lady Gaga sits down in the studio"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"She spends like half a day with each track"
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Really putting the Gaga spin on it, right?"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And turning it into a polished record"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Oh, so this is going to take her forever"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"Honestly, I got-- Guys, I'm so sorry"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"I got to read this to you"
01:26:31;01:26:32;"This is insane"
01:26:32;01:26:33;"This is very confusing"
01:26:33;01:26:34;"This is from People Magazine"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"And it's also like a confluence of like a lot of things we've just talked about"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"That Oreo announced that at some point today"
01:26:41;01:26:45;"It will launch a ""Lady Gaga Oreo Stand Club"""
01:26:45;01:26:46;"Oh my god"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Okay"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"Hold on"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Is Eminem getting a piece of this?"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"That's my question"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"Wait, are these stands for Lady Gaga Oreos?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Yes, it's a stand for Lady Gaga Oreos"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Not Lady Gaga or Oreos"
01:26:59;01:27:05;"And those who are members will receive ""free cookie access"""
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Furthermore, on December 15th"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"It will launch a ""Sing it with Oreo"" sweepstakes"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"With Lady Gaga prizes to be won"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"There's no official date set for this edible cash grab"
01:27:14;01:27:17;"But it will be available in mini six cookie packs"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Beginning in January"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"I think we all need to make one of these things tonight"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"This is giving me a headache"
01:27:24;01:27:28;"You need a f***ing law degree to understand this contest"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"I was wrong"
01:27:29;01:27:32;"I thought this was just like a simple spread love"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"You know, a lot of times a company just builds a website"
01:27:34;01:27:38;"That's just like, ""Hey, do this thing and you're entered in a contest"""
01:27:38;01:27:39;"But this is some wild s***"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"I don't fully understand this"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Honestly, I think this goes back to Garfield"
01:27:43;01:27:47;"Like, why isn't this being like, totally destroyed?"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"These cookies"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"By the Bugs Bunny fans?"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"Yeah, I just don't think it's right"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"How do we choose what's right and wrong?"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"We just... it's madness"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"I agree"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I'm looking forward to the Lady Gaga album"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"69 songs about Oreos"
01:28:02;01:28:09;"Lady Gaga is teaming up with Stephen Merritt of the Magnetic Fields"
01:28:09;01:28:12;"To craft a once in a lifetime triple album"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"I love that album"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"The original"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"I can't believe that we've had like, three people explain this"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"And I still don't totally get it"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"But honestly"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"I'm still..."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"I don't want to sound frustrated though"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"It's just hard to follow"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"And in fact, maybe part of it is just like"
01:28:29;01:28:33;"In this crazy time when your attention is being pulled in so many directions"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"Creating this... I know people are going to be mad"
01:28:36;01:28:39;"But kind of Vorheesian, labyrinthine"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"To use a word Jake used earlier"
01:28:41;01:28:44;"Byzantine, bizarre"
01:28:44;01:28:48;"I'm sure like the legal document you have to sign to participate in this"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Is probably hundreds of pages"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"And maybe in some ways"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"One of the kindnesses that they're doing"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Is by sucking you into like"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"This crazy universe that's going to take up weeks of your life"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"Because frankly this has been a very difficult year"
01:29:02;01:29:06;"I'm sure there's a lot of lonely Lady Gaga Oreo stands out there"
01:29:06;01:29:09;"Who would happily dedicate the next two months"
01:29:09;01:29:12;"To being part of this movement"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"And that is a kindness"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"Do you think we could get Gaga on the show to explain it to us?"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"Maybe we could get somebody from Oreos"
01:29:19;01:29:23;"But I also like that the last time we talked about Oreos on the show"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"Was their weird apocalyptic doomsday thing"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"That's like hey, basically the world's going to end"
01:29:28;01:29:32;"So we're burying some Oreos up by the Seed Vault in Norway"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"By the Arctic Circle"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"I wonder if it's like the same team came up with both of them"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"Or there's like two young rival people in like the Oreos marketing department"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"And one of them is like this like"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"Kind of super cool nihilistic one"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Who's like honestly"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Here's how we should be marketing the product"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"The world's f*cking ending"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"Eat an Oreo"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"What are you watching your figure?"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"You got nowhere to go man"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"The world's being ravaged by a plague"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Just go f*cking eat an Oreo"
01:29:57;01:30:00;"So let's do a campaign that reminds people that the world is ending"
01:30:00;01:30:03;"And that we're going to protect Oreos"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"And then that's like the one nihilistic person"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"And then somebody else is like"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Honestly that's not what Oreos is all about"
01:30:08;01:30:11;"When I think of Oreos like Don Draper style"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"When I think of Oreos"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Basically it's like Mad Men style"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"Like Pete comes in with some f*cking edgy idea"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"And Don Draper's just like"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Pete, shut your mouth"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"These little trends"
01:30:24;01:30:27;"The way that people treat each other like f*ck in this world"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"It's not funny"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"It doesn't help sell our product"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"And it doesn't help make the world a better place"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"We're not selling cookies"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"We're selling kindness"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"And who better to team up with"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"Than Lady Gaga"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"To help us sell kindness"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"When I think of eating an Oreo"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"I think of being a child"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"I think about how with great ceremony"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"I unscrewed the Oreo"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"And dunked it in the milk"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"Those are beautiful minutes of my life"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"That I want to share with my children"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"And all these young punk rock"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"TikTok Gen Z marketers"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Will never understand the heart of this company"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Actually, really when you think about it"
01:31:06;01:31:09;"These are two diametrically opposed campaigns"
01:31:09;01:31:12;"And then Roger Sterling is"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"F*ck it, let's just do them both"
01:31:14;01:31:17;"It's like this real dramatic"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"I gotta get home"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"He comes in and he's like"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Alright guys, let's do them both"
01:31:23;01:31:26;"I didn't ask for a free ride"
01:31:26;01:31:30;"I only asked you to show me a real good time"
01:31:30;01:31:34;"I never asked for the rainbow"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"At least I showed up"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"You showed me the thing"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"And I'm"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"It's coming down on me"
01:31:42;01:31:46;"Water like misery"
01:31:46;01:31:50;"It's coming down on me"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"I'm ready to rain on me"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"I'd rather be drunk but at least I'm alive"
01:31:57;01:32:01;"Rain on me, rain, rain, rain on me, rain, rain"
01:32:01;01:32:05;"I'd rather be drunk but at least I'm alive"
01:32:05;01:32:09;"Rain on me, rain, rain, rain on me"
01:32:09;01:32:12;"Do you guys know Guitar Center's slogan?"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"No"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"Their slogan is"
01:32:14;01:32:17;"All we sell is the greatest feeling on earth"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Whoa"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"Kind of wordy, but"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"It's inelegant phrasing"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"But the sentiment is very similar to this"
01:32:24;01:32:27;"Have you ever brought a girl to Guitar Center?"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"I've been there with"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"Yes, I've been there with my wife"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"Multiple times, Pasadena run"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Not before you were married"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"Was that during the courting phase?"
01:32:40;01:32:41;"Yeah"
01:32:41;01:32:47;"I don't think so, maybe"
01:32:47;01:32:51;"Kazzy, what would you do if a guy brought you to Guitar Center as a date"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"And surprised you with a guitar?"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Like surprised me with a guitar?"
01:32:56;01:32:57;"Like he gave me a guitar?"
01:32:57;01:33:01;"Or he surprised me with his own guitar and played me a song?"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"No, like"
01:33:02;01:33:05;"I was thinking more of a romantic gesture"
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Like took you to Guitar Center"
01:33:06;01:33:07;"A gift"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Yeah, as a gift"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Maybe demoed it a little bit for you"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"And then was like, ""Surprise"""
01:33:11;01:33:13;"I know you like guitars as an object"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"And I thought this one felt really special"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"What would I do?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Not ghost him, I guess"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"Like that's a f***ing weird-ass thing to do"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"Whoa"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"What about this?"
01:33:26;01:33:29;"You've been dating a guy for like four months"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"You're driving down Sunset"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"You're driving past the Guitar Center"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"He's like, ""Oh, I just gotta pop in for a sec"""
01:33:35;01:33:37;"""Find the spot right in front"""
01:33:37;01:33:39;"He's like, ""Wanna sit in the car?"""
01:33:39;01:33:41;"""I can leave the car on, you can listen to the radio"""
01:33:41;01:33:42;"""Or you wanna come in, I gotta just..."""
01:33:42;01:33:43;"This is how you'd have to do it"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"He'd have to be like, ""Listen"""
01:33:45;01:33:49;"""I know it's gonna be embarrassing for you to come into Guitar Hero"""
01:33:49;01:33:50;"""Guitar Hero"""
01:33:50;01:33:52;"""Guitar Center with me"""
01:33:52;01:33:54;"""I understand"""
01:33:54;01:33:56;"He would have to get it"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"""Would you mind if we just went in?"""
01:33:58;01:33:59;"""I know it's bad"""
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Wait, why is it embarrassing for you?"
01:34:01;01:34:04;"Hold on, why is it embarrassing for you to go into Guitar Center?"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"Yeah, I don't get it"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"It should just feel like a weird cliche"
01:34:08;01:34:09;"What's the cliche?"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Being the girlfriend?"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"Yeah, like a guy showing off with the guitars"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"And their knowledge about guitars"
01:34:18;01:34:21;"Well, there's definitely a thing that I've heard from female musicians"
01:34:21;01:34:25;"About feeling they're condescended to in a guitar store"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Maybe not Guitar Center in particular"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"But going into a guitar shop and people being like"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"Rather than talking to them like"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"""Oh, sh*t, how can I help you?"""
01:34:36;01:34:37;"Being kind of like"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"""What is your boyfriend looking for?"""
01:34:39;01:34:44;"""Hey little lady, didn't feel like sitting in the car while your boyfriend bought strings?"""
01:34:44;01:34:47;"""Well, uh, check this out"""
01:34:47;01:34:51;"Yeah, so I can imagine it being an alienating space"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"Just like people often talk about record stores"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Also feeling like a place of condescension"
01:34:56;01:35:00;"As much as I wouldn't want a guy to come shopping with me"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Because that's a stereotype for him"
01:35:02;01:35:05;"And he's the bored guy on the chair"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"I wouldn't want to be that in Guitar Center"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"Well, thanks so much Gazzi"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"Congrats on your best-selling book"
01:35:14;01:35:18;"Hope COVID ends soon so you can go see some more Dead & Co. shows"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"Yeah, same"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Hope I make it to number 6, you guys"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"I mean number 7"
01:35:23;01:35:27;"That would put you officially as the second most guested guest"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"Maybe we can work it out so you can have me before you have Winter again"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"So I have a small lead"
01:35:33;01:35:37;"I'm sorry, I think we'll be having Winter very soon"
01:35:37;01:35:41;"But I like this, Gazzi vs. Winter race to the top"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Fighting for second"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Alright, well have a good one"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"Thanks you guys"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Good to see you"
01:35:47;01:35:56;"For today's Top 5"
01:35:56;01:36:00;"We're just going to do the Top 5 hits this week in 1959"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Why 1959, Jake?"
01:36:02;01:36:06;"That was the year that the organ center opened up"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Organ center"
01:36:08;01:36:11;"Rather than compare it to 2020"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"I think in the interest of time"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"Let's plunge directly into 1959"
01:36:16;01:36:19;"This might be one of the oldest Top 5s you've ever done"
01:36:19;01:36:22;"I think we did like one from the 40s once"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"But this is certainly the oldest in a while"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"So let's get into it"
01:36:26;01:36:30;"At number 5 we got Ernie Fields & Orchestra - Within the Mood"
01:36:30;01:36:35;"Okay, this is chugging"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Oh, this song?"
01:36:38;01:36:47;"Are there lyrics to this?"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"I don't know"
01:36:49;01:36:53;"I guess not"
01:36:53;01:37:03;"Is this a blues chord progression?"
01:37:03;01:37:08;"I mean, Ernie Fields was a trombonist, pianist, arranger, and band leader from Oklahoma"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"It's all about the arrangement"
01:37:10;01:37:15;"So February of '59 is when Buddy Holly and Ritchie Balance and Vic Bopper died"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Oh, wow"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Yeah, and I've heard that, like I've read that like"
01:37:18;01:37:22;"After that happened in February of '59 that like rock music went"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Kind of receded for a while"
01:37:24;01:37:27;"And people like later that year in '59 were like"
01:37:27;01:37:31;"Oh, maybe rock music is like kind of going to fizzle out now"
01:37:31;01:37:35;"Right, like people just had kind of negative associations with it"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"People just wanted to like"
01:37:37;01:37:41;"Jam out to some music like this and not think about it"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Because this is definitely not like rock music"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Like what is this music?"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"It's like dance jazz"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"And also it says this was a big band standard"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"First recorded by Glenn Miller in 1939"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"This is like an old ass song that they're just like busting out and doing like"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"I guess this is kind of like rock and roll in a sense"
01:37:59;01:38:03;"Like it doesn't have like the rawness of like rock around the clock"
01:38:03;01:38:08;"So you can imagine like the people in poodle skirts like dancing to this"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"For sure"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Going down to the record store and be like"
01:38:11;01:38:15;"Can I please have a copy of Ernie Fields and Orchestra in the Mood?"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"Going home, throwing this on, your little record player in your bedroom"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"Just like dancing around"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Like I f***ing love this song"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"You paid ten cents for the seven inch?"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Goodbye"
01:38:28;01:38:33;"The number four song, Della Reese, singer, actress"
01:38:33;01:38:36;"She was on Touched by an Angel"
01:38:36;01:38:40;"Much later, about 40 years later"
01:38:40;01:38:45;"But in 1959, she had a number four hit on the charts with Don't You Know"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"Again, this song had also been a hit previously"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"1959"
01:38:50;01:38:54;"Oh, I know this"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"When was this song a hit?"
01:38:56;01:38:59;"In 1952 by Sammy K"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"That version reached 28"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"So minor hit"
01:39:02;01:39:05;"Oh yeah, this is based on La Boheme"
01:39:05;01:39:13;"I love this s***"
01:39:13;01:39:16;"So would this be like American songbook?"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Like what is this?"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Well, I think it's like happened a lot back then"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Somebody would take an old melody"
01:39:21;01:39:25;"Like kind of like weepy Italian opera song"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"And then just write some lyrics to it"
01:39:27;01:39:31;"I mean this was like what was called pop music then, right?"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"Like Frank Sinatra was called pop music"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"Yeah"
01:39:35;01:39:43;"But I love those like strings"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"Those strings, yeah"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"I'm just picturing those big beautiful"
01:39:47;01:39:51;"Wood paneled like recording studios like in Hollywood somewhere"
01:39:51;01:39:54;"Oh yeah, like Capitol Records studios"
01:39:54;01:39:57;"Just peak empire, you know"
01:39:57;01:40:02;"Just the guy in the control booth smoking a cigarette with a glass of whiskey"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"And just, you know"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"You can just picture them, man"
01:40:06;01:40:09;"Yeah, they did like two takes of this"
01:40:09;01:40:12;"They're like, ""Dilla, we got it"""
01:40:12;01:40:14;"Roll down a musa and a franks or a martini"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"That's that"
01:40:17;01:40:21;"You think that like the instrumental track was recorded in one go"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"And then she did her vocals separately?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"That's a good question"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"I mean, I can"
01:40:26;01:40:29;"1959, they very well could have recorded it all together"
01:40:29;01:40:30;"Right"
01:40:30;01:40:33;"Like the drummer in that orchestral group like"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Was in World War II"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"And just like they're tracking that"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"He's just flashing back to killing just like 20 dudes in one day"
01:40:41;01:40:45;"I mean like he was literally like in Italy"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"Yeah"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"He helped like liberate Italy"
01:40:47;01:40:50;"He like killed 20 dudes in one day and he's just drunk off his ass"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"Like playing the cymbal"
01:40:52;01:40:58;"God, the 50s are such an intense weird time"
01:40:58;01:40:59;"I know"
01:40:59;01:41:03;"40s through the 60s is like an insane set of decades"
01:41:03;01:41:07;"Also, I'm just like picturing like 1959"
01:41:07;01:41:11;"Some like 15 year old brings this record home and is listening to it"
01:41:11;01:41:16;"And their like grandma who was born in Italy in like 1875"
01:41:16;01:41:20;"Is like sitting in the corner of like the apartment in Brooklyn"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"And just like hearing this melody and just like"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"They barely even speak the same language and just like this weird"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"Yeah"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"Cross-cultural"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Sounds like The Sopranos"
01:41:30;01:41:35;"Yeah, it's like well Sopranos three generations earlier"
01:41:35;01:41:38;"I know that song partially because I have this memory of like"
01:41:38;01:41:43;"Buying a CD somewhere that was randomly the greatest hits of 1959"
01:41:43;01:41:46;"I wonder if I'm gonna know any more that was on there"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"Whoa"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"I would love shit like that, the chart hits"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"Billboard used to do a series of tapes I remember having as a kid"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"That'd be like the top 10 hits of 1963"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Yeah"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"That put me onto a lot of music"
01:41:56;01:41:59;"But I just specifically remember I had a 1959 CD"
01:41:59;01:42:03;"So the number three, The Fleetwoods were a group from Olympia, Washington"
01:42:03;01:42:06;"Kind of precursor to Bikini Kill perhaps"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"And this is their song Mr. Blue"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Let's check it out, I think I know this song too"
01:42:10;01:42:17;"Oh yeah, this is a cool song"
01:42:17;01:42:25;"It's kind of like Chet Baker jazz"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Yeah"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"But it's a little simpler pop"
01:42:28;01:42:32;"Oh this is I'm Mr. Blue"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Oh yeah"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"So this is like a long intro I think"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"Yeah, I think it's a separate intro"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Yeah"
01:42:37;01:42:44;"Wait, they're from Olympia?"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Yeah"
01:42:45;01:42:56;"Can you imagine these guys playing a gig in Olympia?"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"Wow"
01:42:57;01:43:01;"In 1959, like at a bar, like in 1958"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"Yeah, what was going on in Olympia in 1958?"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Logging, man"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"Yeah, a bunch of loggers"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Blue collar town, man"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Yeah"
01:43:09;01:43:17;"And the guys in The Fleetwoods were like, ""We got a big gig in Seattle this Saturday"""
01:43:17;01:43:21;"And like Seattle in 1959 is like, also just like"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Quiet"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"Yeah"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Did they write it?"
01:43:34;01:43:37;"It says it's written by Dwayne Blackwell"
01:43:37;01:43:40;"Seems like there are a lot of versions of this"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Covered by Dylan"
01:43:42;01:43:45;"Dylan dropped a version in 1967"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Garth Brooks"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Friend of the show, Garth Brooks"
01:43:48;01:43:52;"I love that song, that's beautiful"
01:43:52;01:43:53;"Yeah"
01:43:53;01:43:57;"You know, you can see how the music of this era is so like weird and haunting"
01:43:57;01:44:03;"That it's not hard to understand why a lot of artists that we like, who probably were children in this era"
01:44:03;01:44:12;"Went on to make art that interacted with the kind of quiet, sad eeriness of the culture"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"Because when I think about The Fleetwoods coming out of Olympia, Washington"
01:44:15;01:44:19;"The first thing I think of is like Twin Peaks, David Lynch"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"30 years later"
01:44:21;01:44:22;"Yeah"
01:44:22;01:44:27;"That is weird, eerie show in rural Washington"
01:44:27;01:44:34;"Well, and also the music in that show, like, it keeps going to like the woman in the weird smoky bar or whatever"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Like singing these old songs"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"Yeah"
01:44:37;01:44:40;"1959, you've been logging all week"
01:44:40;01:44:45;"Friday night, go to a local bar, that's playing on the jukebox"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"I love local music"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Oh, s***, The Fleetwoods"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Oh"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"I went to high school with the guitarist"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Yeah, Fleetwoods played my senior prom"
01:44:55;01:45:02;"The number two song, 1959, Guy Mitchell, Heartaches by the Number"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"I don't know if I know this one"
01:45:04;01:45:11;"Guy Mitchell was a singer and actor who starred in the Guy Mitchell show as well as NBC's Whispering Smith"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"Wow, this is some Once Upon a Time in Hollywood stuff right here"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Oh, yes, seriously"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Pure Rick Dalton"
01:45:18;01:45:19;"Yeah"
01:45:24;01:45:29;"He's doing some country, but he was born in Detroit to Croatian immigrant parents"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Served in the Navy during World War II"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"By the time he started making it through, he was past 30"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Amazing"
01:45:36;01:45:44;"Yeah, that's a weird period, like, I think Clint Eastwood put out a record, like kind of a crooner record"
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Oh, really?"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"In the 50s or very early 60s"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Before the..."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"So Rick Dalton"
01:45:50;01:45:55;"You're like a good-looking, like, 23-year-old guy or whatever"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"I mean, this guy was older, but like"
01:45:57;01:46:02;"There were a lot of guys that were probably like, yeah, good-looking guys that could kind of act and that kind of thing"
01:46:02;01:46:06;"Yes, I've got heartaches by the number"
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Troubles by the score"
01:46:09;01:46:14;"Every day in love and rest, each day I love you more"
01:46:14;01:46:18;"Yes, I've got heartaches by the number"
01:46:18;01:46:21;"A love that I can't win"
01:46:21;01:46:27;"But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"I've got heartaches by the number"
01:46:29;01:46:33;"But the day that I stop counting, it's the day my world will end"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Dark"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"Clint Eastwood's song is really good"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I didn't know he released all his music"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"So he released a lot"
01:46:40;01:46:45;"In 1961, in '62, and then in 1970"
01:46:45;01:46:49;"Wait, Clint Eastwood put out a record in '70?"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Yeah"
01:46:51;01:46:55;"That would have been so sick if he put out this like crazy, like, psych record"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"It's called, by the way, it sounds like one"
01:46:57;01:47:00;"It's called ""I Talk to the Trees"""
01:47:00;01:47:01;"What?"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Definitely sounds like a psych record"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"Can we get ""I Talk to the Trees"" by Clint Eastwood on?"
01:47:06;01:47:26;"I talk to the trees"
01:47:26;01:47:30;"But they don't listen to me"
01:47:30;01:47:35;"I talk to the stars"
01:47:35;01:47:39;"But they never hear me"
01:47:39;01:47:47;"Clint Eastwood has his own Warner Brothers distributed imprint called Malpaso Records"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Oh"
01:47:49;01:47:53;"I talk to them all"
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Not great"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"He's not a bad singer"
01:47:57;01:48:03;"It's funny, like, hearing it pre-autotune, it's definitely a bit pitchy"
01:48:03;01:48:06;"A little bit, but not unforgivable"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"No, no"
01:48:07;01:48:12;"When I hear these guys' voices, I mean, I'm not like deeply familiar with the full context of this"
01:48:12;01:48:22;"But like, are they all slightly doing a Post-Chet Baker thing?"
01:48:22;01:48:25;"Because when you really think about it, it's a very distinct way of singing"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"But maybe there's other..."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"Yeah, I mean, you know how it is"
01:48:29;01:48:34;"Different eras had different styles, like early 90s was like"
01:48:34;01:48:39;"Right, but so much of that directly came from Eddie Vedder"
01:48:39;01:48:45;"But did it though? I mean, it's like, I think it was more of like a cultural kind of zeitgeist"
01:48:45;01:48:49;"I think Chris Cornell was like, in like Layne's ""Aliens"""
01:48:49;01:48:53;"No, Chris Cornell was, he was like definitely in the plant vein"
01:48:53;01:48:56;"Yeah, I don't know man"
01:48:56;01:49:00;"Vedder is the true originator of the ""Vrrooom vrooom vrooom"""
01:49:00;01:49:04;"I don't even know how to describe it, is it like vaguely southern or something?"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"It's the yarl, right? Isn't that what it's called?"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"The yarl?"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"Yeah, ""yarrrr"""
01:49:10;01:49:15;"I had a friend who used to call those bands ""Herm bands"""
01:49:15;01:49:17;"""Herm"""
01:49:17;01:49:21;"Wait, does ""herm"" refer to like the type, it's like ""Herm"""
01:49:21;01:49:23;"Yeah, it's like the sound"
01:49:23;01:49:28;"""Herm, Herm, Herm, Herm, Herm, yeah"""
01:49:28;01:49:33;"I'd like to get to the bottom of that, that would be a good episode"
01:49:33;01:49:38;"To like focus for an episode, to get into the bottom of the ""Herm yarl"""
01:49:38;01:49:42;"My name is Herm, Herm yarl"
01:49:42;01:49:46;"I'm your substitute teacher today"
01:49:46;01:49:49;"You can call me Mr. Yarl, but I'm also okay with Herm"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"Oh my god, Herm yarl"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"(laughter)"
01:49:54;01:50:01;"Guys, aside from Nickelback, are there any contemporary artists still using that voice?"
01:50:01;01:50:07;"Would you say like, ""Herm, do they have a bit of a Herm?"""
01:50:07;01:50:11;"I don't think so, not that much"
01:50:11;01:50:14;"I think it comes from Vedder, but I'd love to get deeper on this"
01:50:14;01:50:18;"Let's get some grunge experts on the show and really go deep"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"Get Michael Azarad to call in"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"Yeah, he would have some good insight"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"Let's get Azarad"
01:50:24;01:50:28;"I'm also just picturing, ""We should write a song called 'Herm Yarl'"""
01:50:28;01:50:32;"And it's kind of like a grunge, it's like a grunge jam flow, man"
01:50:32;01:50:37;"It's basically like, ""Gather 'round, I'm telling stories"
01:50:37;01:50:43;"Of my name, Herm, Herm yarl, yeah"""
01:50:47;01:50:52;"We have to write it in Drop D, of course"
01:50:52;01:50:57;"It's a little bit like Jeremy, Pearl Jam, no?"
01:50:57;01:51:01;"Yeah, well, that's a major pillar of the style"
01:51:01;01:51:06;"Herm yarl spoken, in the land"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"(laughter)"
01:51:08;01:51:13;"So do you think with all these moments where there's a defining voice or signature"
01:51:13;01:51:19;"Does it go back to a specific person or is there sort of like a collective kind of movement?"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Is it hive mind?"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"Yeah, is it hive mind or is there like a first..."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Well, I guess Jake and I are taking opposing views here"
01:51:25;01:51:30;"I think it comes from one iconic person who introduces the style, but I could be wrong"
01:51:30;01:51:34;"It is interesting to think, like, we do this whole song and it's about Herm yarl"
01:51:34;01:51:37;"And we tell him the whole legend of Herm yarl"
01:51:37;01:51:42;"And then you find out at the end that really all Herm yarl was"
01:51:42;01:51:47;"The collective consciousness of all the dudes who started singing like that that way"
01:51:47;01:51:51;"When they were possessed by the same zeitgeist of the early 90s"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"The ghost of Herm yarl"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"Yeah, it's like that line from Sympathy for the Devil, like"
01:51:56;01:51:59;"""Who killed the Kennedys? After all, it was you and me"""
01:51:59;01:52:04;"But we basically find out that Herm yarl is our collective consciousness"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"Of anybody who was alive in the early 90s"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"Herm yarl is the spirit"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"Is the spirit of the music"
01:52:11;01:52:16;"We tell the story of his life and it's how he dropped down to San Diego high school"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Met a young dude named Eddie Vedder"
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Took him surfing"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Left him with some ideas"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Then he flew to..."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"Where's Collective Soul from?"
01:52:25;01:52:29;"I want to say South Carolina, North Carolina"
01:52:29;01:52:32;"Herm yarl goes around, he's like Santa Claus going around the country"
01:52:32;01:52:35;"It's like some Touched by an Angel s*** actually"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Wait, Seinfeld, here's a number crunch"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"What year did Collective Soul start?"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"1992"
01:52:41;01:52:46;"I think the first Pearl Jam record came out in the fall of '91, I want to say"
01:52:46;01:52:50;"Right, and they'd been a band for a few years before that"
01:52:50;01:52:53;"I think that band took off pretty fast after Vedder joined"
01:52:53;01:52:59;"But let's say, it's totally possible that Collective Soul heard Pearl Jam in the fall of '91"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"And were like, ""Let's start a band"""
01:53:01;01:53:03;"And the guy was just like, ""Yeah!"""
01:53:03;01:53:06;"(laughter)"
01:53:06;01:53:10;"Wait, Seinfeld..."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"What year did Stone Temple Pilots start?"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"Because I feel like Stone Temple Pilots was going to predate it"
01:53:16;01:53:22;"Stone Temple Pilots, years active, '89 was when they started"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Okay, so..."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"We don't know what he sounded like then"
01:53:26;01:53:27;"Yeah, he might have changed"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Well, can we dig up?"
01:53:28;01:53:31;"He sounded like Axl in '89 and then he switched"
01:53:31;01:53:34;"He was visited by Herm yarl"
01:53:34;01:53:38;"Gather around, let me tell the tale of Herm yarl"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"(laughter)"
01:53:41;01:53:46;"That's going to be the worst song ever"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"(laughter)"
01:53:48;01:53:53;"I'm down to spend way too much time working on it, but it's going to be terrible"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"It can't be a mountain breeze song"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"We have to start a new project for this called Herm yarl"
01:53:58;01:53:59;"Yeah"
01:53:59;01:54:02;"First EP is called Herm yarl, track one, Herm yarl"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"(laughter)"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"Short-lived bands, but crucial"
01:54:08;01:54:12;"Look, regardless of whether it all started with Eddie Vedder or not"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"He is 100% one of the most imitated"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Actually, I don't even want to go on"
01:54:17;01:54:21;"This will be a whole long story, but I sometimes find that people..."
01:54:21;01:54:25;"There's a thing people say where they're sometimes like, ""Well, Nirvana was the best"
01:54:25;01:54:29;"And then Pearl Jam was kind of like wannabe Nirvana, but they were pretty good"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"And then you get to the third tier"
01:54:31;01:54:34;"And I've always kind of felt like Nirvana was their own thing"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"And Pearl Jam was their own thing"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"They played punk rock, man"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"And I think Pearl Jam was kind of like a different thing"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Totally"
01:54:42;01:54:47;"And Nirvana was bigger, and depending on your taste, like, better"
01:54:47;01:54:51;"But I would actually say that Pearl Jam was more influential than Nirvana in a way"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"I'm not trying to be provocative here, I'm just saying like"
01:54:54;01:54:57;"If you're looking just at the Herm yarl"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"But that's big"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"No, but you're right, I mean like"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Nirvana's like hard to copy"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"You know what I mean?"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"Of the bands that were really big later, like, who are terrible"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Like your Creed's and your Nickelback's"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"They're definitely taking more from Pearl Jam than Nirvana"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"In fact, I can picture those guys being like"
01:55:14;01:55:17;"I really love Pearl Jam 10"
01:55:17;01:55:20;"To be honest, never totally got the hype around Nirvana"
01:55:20;01:55:24;"And I kind of, by the time Vitology came out, I was like kind of off the train"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Oh yeah"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"Even more specifically, because Pearl Jam's had a very long and varied career"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"It's like that first record"
01:55:30;01:55:31;"Yep"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"More than anything"
01:55:32;01:55:35;"Let's get some grunge experts on this"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"Because we got a lot of research to do"
01:55:37;01:55:42;"To really make sure we earn the full 14 minutes of Herm yarl"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"*Grunge noises*"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"I guess also, Hootie"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"I'm kind of doing a Hootie voice, Darius Rucker actually"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Oh yeah!"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"He's a very post-vetter"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"I bet he was up and running before Pearl Jam"
01:55:54;01:55:59;"I bet that guy Darius Rucker was like singing in that style before he heard Vetter"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"I really think it's a nice thing, man"
01:56:02;01:56:05;"Hootie and the Blowfish was formed in '86"
01:56:05;01:56:06;"Ooh"
01:56:06;01:56:10;"Yes, sure, but that big album came out in '94, right?"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"Yeah"
01:56:11;01:56:15;"So before '91, Darius Rucker sang like Michael Stipe"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"It's possible"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"*Laughs*"
01:56:19;01:56:22;"No matter what, Eddie Vetter is a hugely influential vocalist"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"And obviously Pearl Jam is a very influential band"
01:56:24;01:56:25;"Yeah"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"Okay, the number one song"
01:56:27;01:56:30;"I remember this was on my 1959 CD"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"The number one song this week in 1959"
01:56:33;01:56:36;"The legend Bobby Darin with ""Mac the Knife"""
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Oh, hell yeah!"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"Great song"
01:56:39;01:56:42;"*Music*"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"This is a cool weird song"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"*Music*"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"Wow"
01:56:47;01:57:09;"*Music*"
01:57:09;01:57:13;"I mean, most people know this is a Vile Brecht song"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"From the Three Penny Opera"
01:57:14;01:57:18;"But it's amazing to think that this was written in 1928"
01:57:18;01:57:22;"So many of the songs in the charts are like reinterpretations of old songs"
01:57:22;01:57:23;"Yeah"
01:57:23;01:57:48;"*Music*"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"Came up on a dead body"
01:57:50;01:57:53;"I actually don't know what this song is, I've never really heard the lyrics"
01:57:53;01:57:56;"I mean, I guess Mac the Knife is a murderer"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"Or like an assassin"
01:57:58;01:58:27;"*Music*"
01:58:56;01:59:02;"*Music*"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"What the hell is he singing?"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"*Music*"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"He's just like listing names"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"I guess they're characters from the Three Penny Opera"
01:59:12;01:59:18;"Although Lottie Lenya is a German singer who acted in the play"
01:59:18;01:59:20;"*Music*"
01:59:20;01:59:21;"Maggie?"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"What do you think? Maggie"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Yeah, I don't know what the hell that song is about"
01:59:25;01:59:28;"This is about the origin story of Whole Foods"
01:59:28;01:59:29;"John Mackey"
01:59:29;01:59:34;"I didn't have it in me to listen to the John Mackey three hour episode of Joe Rogan"
01:59:34;01:59:37;"Oh yeah, I gotta check that out"
01:59:37;01:59:39;"In theory I should have listened to it, but I didn't"
01:59:39;01:59:44;"Bobby Darin is one of those guys that had like a transformation in the late 60s"
01:59:44;01:59:46;"Have you ever heard his version of ""If I Was a Carpenter""?"
01:59:46;01:59:57;"No, but last summer I watched the Beyond the Sea biopic starring Kevin Spacey"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"Oh, there's a Bobby Darin biopic?"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"Yeah, it's like a whole thing"
02:00:01;02:00:02;"Weird"
02:00:02;02:00:09;"I watched it on vacation with Ariel, Danielle, Rashida, and TC Corp crew member Deathspot"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"Tight group"
02:00:11;02:00:13;"Here's how it all started"
02:00:13;02:00:18;"For some reason, Ariel had the song ""Splish Splash"" stuck in his head, which is Bobby Darin's first set"
02:00:18;02:00:22;"Bobby Darin basically idolized Frank Sinatra and sh*t"
02:00:22;02:00:25;"He always wanted to be this kind of crooner, jazzy dude"
02:00:25;02:00:31;"But he couldn't get it up and running, so he wrote this kind of dumb, fake rock and roll song called ""Splish Splash"""
02:00:31;02:00:34;"And that started his career, and then he used that to do what he really wanted to do"
02:00:34;02:00:38;"Which is like ""Mack the Knife"" and ""Somewhere beyond the sea"""
02:00:38;02:00:43;"But anyway, it basically started where Ariel was like ""What are the actual lyrics to Splish Splash?"""
02:00:43;02:00:45;"See if you can finish the opening lines, Jake"
02:00:45;02:00:48;"""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"""
02:00:48;02:00:50;"At home on a Saturday night?"
02:00:50;02:00:53;"At home on a Saturday night? No"
02:00:53;02:00:58;"It's very weird, and I guess this is like an old, somewhat archaic phrase"
02:00:58;02:01:03;"It's ""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath, long about a Saturday night"""
02:01:03;02:01:05;"Long about?"
02:01:05;02:01:10;"Long about a Saturday night, it's like a phrase I wasn't really familiar with, we don't really use that"
02:01:10;02:01:14;"I guess it basically just meant around Saturday night, or on Saturday night"
02:01:14;02:01:17;"It's something people used to say, ""long about a Saturday night"""
02:01:17;02:01:20;"But basically he was like ""What the f*ck is that second line?"""
02:01:20;02:01:22;"And then we kind of became this whole thing about looking up"
02:01:22;02:01:27;"And then we were talking about Bobby Darin a lot, and I'd heard about this bizarre biopic"
02:01:27;02:01:31;"That Kevin Spacey was obsessed with making, and he insisted on making it"
02:01:31;02:01:35;"Even though by the time it got made he was far too old to play young Bobby Darin"
02:01:35;02:01:41;"And it's very bizarre, and surreal, and super cheesy, kind of uncomfortable"
02:01:41;02:01:45;"But I did learn a lot about Bobby Darin's life, and it was kind of interesting"
02:01:45;02:01:51;"He was this real New York dude, tortured artist kind of"
02:01:51;02:01:54;"The Splish Splash thing he felt embarrassed by"
02:01:54;02:01:57;"And then he kind of has this crooner phase, and then in the late 60s"
02:01:57;02:02:03;"He basically was influenced by the hippie culture, and started writing protest music"
02:02:03;02:02:06;"And he even wrote a song that people were kind of into"
02:02:06;02:02:09;"But I never heard the cover that you're talking about, Jake"
02:02:09;02:02:15;"If I was a carpenter, and you were a lady"
02:02:15;02:02:17;"That's always an intriguing phenomenon"
02:02:17;02:02:24;"The guys who are around in the 50s who make a slightly counter-cultural or psych record in the 60s"
02:02:24;02:02:31;"There's a Dale Shannon record from the late 60s called ""The Continuing Ventures of Charles Wendover"""
02:02:31;02:02:33;"Oh, I've heard about that record"
02:02:33;02:02:36;"So this is basically the part of the movie that I'm thinking about"
02:02:36;02:02:41;"Basically his career was in a weird place in the late 60s"
02:02:41;02:02:48;"And he was at the Ambassador Hotel the night that RFK was assassinated"
02:02:48;02:02:51;"And he'd actually been working on the campaign"
02:02:51;02:02:54;"Because he was always a lefty dude"
02:02:54;02:02:59;"And he'd also found out some heavy s*** about his background"
02:02:59;02:03:02;"So he was having a really intense midlife crisis"
02:03:02;02:03:05;"Combined with all the crazy things happening in the world"
02:03:05;02:03:10;"So after that happened, Bobby Darin left his family"
02:03:10;02:03:14;"And lived in seclusion in a trailer near Big Sur for a year"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"Whoa, in '69?"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"In '68"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"And then he came back to LA in '69"
02:03:20;02:03:23;"And he wrote a song called ""Simple Song of Freedom"""
02:03:23;02:03:26;"Which was his protest 60s song"
02:03:26;02:03:31;"And Tim Harden recorded a version and it became a bestseller"
02:03:31;02:03:33;"So he did have this very unusual career"
02:03:33;02:03:37;"From early rock and roll, Splish Splash, to the Mac the Knife s***"
02:03:37;02:03:40;"And Tim Harden, I think more of as a songwriter"
02:03:40;02:03:43;"Tim Harden wrote ""If I Were a Carpenter"""
02:03:43;02:03:48;"I think Tim Harden also wrote ""If I Listen Long Enough to You"""
02:03:48;02:03:51;"Oh, beautiful song"
02:03:51;02:03:56;"I found a way to believe it's all true"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"Well, why don't we throw on some Bobby Darin"
02:03:59;02:04:02;"""If I Were a Carpenter"" on the way out"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"Thank you to Kazzy David"
02:04:04;02:04:06;"Thank you to Guitar Center"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"Thank you to Bobby Darin"
02:04:08;02:04:10;"We'll see you guys in two weeks, peace"
02:04:10;02:04:14;"If I were a carpenter"
02:04:14;02:04:18;"And you were a lady"
02:04:18;02:04:22;"Would you marry me anyway"
02:04:22;02:04:28;"And have my baby"
02:04:28;02:04:32;"If a tinker were my trade"
02:04:32;02:04:37;"Would you still find me"
02:04:37;02:04:41;"Carrying the parts I made"
02:04:41;02:04:50;"Following behind me"
02:04:50;02:04:54;"Save my love through loneliness"
02:04:54;02:04:59;"Save my love through sorrows"
02:04:59;02:05:03;"I've given you my onliness"
