00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:08;"It's a dark summer, and this episode, we'll tackle it head on."
00:08;00:15;"We'll be talking about everything from conspiracy theories, to David Berman, and so much more."
00:15;00:23;"We'll also be counting down the top 5 songs on iTunes, and the top 5 Billboard hits of 1999."
00:23;00:26;"This is a summary..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:30;00:32;"B-B-B-B-Beasts."
00:32;00:34;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The world I felt, wobbly, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:03;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Leave it all on me baby"
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:20;01:23;"People are going wild for these fresh eps, man."
01:23;01:26;"They were sick of the banked eps, now we're getting some fresh eps."
01:26;01:28;"Seinfeld, how was the reaction to the last episode?"
01:28;01:31;"People are loving it."
01:31;01:33;"People are into it?"
01:33;01:35;"Yeah, people can't get enough of the fresh eps."
01:35;01:37;"You can taste the difference, you know."
01:37;01:42;"There's just a difference between an ep that's just been delivered fresh from the produce section,"
01:42;01:44;"versus been sitting on a shelf."
01:44;01:45;"It's fresher."
01:45;01:46;"Yeah, it's not a canned ep."
01:46;01:48;"It's definitely a fresher ep."
01:48;01:50;"Well Jake, how have you been the last two weeks?"
01:50;01:51;"Pretty solid."
01:51;01:55;"I like you got the Showtime Documentary Films Patagonia back on."
01:55;01:58;"This is a truly random item of clothing."
01:58;02:01;"This has come up on the show before."
02:01;02:03;"It lives in my car or in my studio."
02:03;02:05;"So you're not wearing it very often?"
02:05;02:06;"No."
02:06;02:11;"Just to paint a picture for everybody, this is a Patagonia half zip."
02:11;02:14;"It's not a heavy pile, it's a light pile."
02:14;02:20;"And on the right upper sleeve, it says Showtime Documentary Films."
02:20;02:28;"What happened was I somehow ended up in a situation where I was taking an Uber here"
02:28;02:30;"because my car broke down yesterday."
02:30;02:32;"Oh, your car broke down?"
02:32;02:34;"And I normally keep clothes in my car."
02:34;02:39;"Because I'm anticipating that the AC is going to be jacked in the Apple Music Studios,"
02:39;02:40;"and I'm not wrong."
02:40;02:41;"It's pretty jacked."
02:41;02:43;"It's frigid in here."
02:43;02:45;"And in the Uber ride over here, it was frigid."
02:45;02:47;"The guy had the temp at 60."
02:47;02:48;"[laughs]"
02:48;02:49;"God."
02:49;02:51;"It's not even that warm outside."
02:51;02:53;"No, it's like upper 70s."
02:53;02:54;"It's an LA evening."
02:54;02:55;"Yeah."
02:55;02:56;"Mid-70s."
02:56;03:00;"So I was like, ""Uh-oh, I don't have my normal wardrobe in my car."""
03:00;03:06;"I usually have a couple shirts and stuff just kind of hanging out in the passenger seat of the car."
03:06;03:07;"No car."
03:07;03:11;"This is this filthy, beat-up polar fleece."
03:11;03:13;"Basically on the floor of my studio."
03:13;03:14;"Grabbed it."
03:14;03:16;"Yeah, it's got some dog hair on it."
03:16;03:17;"Yeah, dog hair, paint."
03:17;03:18;"It smells."
03:18;03:19;"[laughs]"
03:19;03:21;"Like, really terrible."
03:21;03:22;"I look like a dirtbag right now."
03:22;03:23;"It's not your go-to."
03:23;03:24;"No."
03:24;03:26;"You don't look like that much of a dirtbag."
03:26;03:27;"That's cool."
03:27;03:31;"Real quick, lint roller on that, and actually you'd look kind of bourgeois."
03:31;03:33;"I'd look like a member of Empire Weekend."
03:33;03:35;"[laughs]"
03:35;03:36;"I mean, I have--"
03:36;03:38;"You know, like a thin polar fleece and some shorts."
03:38;03:41;"I've been pretty into this one half zip lately."
03:41;03:42;"Sorry, what's the--"
03:42;03:44;"Oh, okay, half zip is just zips halfway down."
03:44;03:46;"It's more like a third of the way down."
03:46;03:48;"That's a half zip."
03:48;03:50;"I'm not going to split hairs here."
03:50;03:53;"Well, yeah, I guess there's such a thing as a quarter zip,"
03:53;03:57;"but I just feel like it's either you're wearing a full zip or a half zip."
03:57;03:59;"Is there a three-quarter zip?"
03:59;04:00;"That would be so awkward."
04:00;04:03;"Picture if you had it all the way down, three-quarter zip."
04:03;04:05;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
04:05;04:06;"That's a good one."
04:06;04:08;"Maybe with a pocket blocking it."
04:08;04:09;"That's the reason."
04:09;04:11;"Okay, you know what, Jake?"
04:11;04:12;"I stand corrected."
04:12;04:14;"I think you're wearing a quarter zip."
04:14;04:19;"I stand corrected."
04:19;04:23;"But that's one of those little quirky things that makes me me."
04:23;04:27;"You know, as discussed on the program, I call buffalo wings buffalo wangs,"
04:27;04:29;"and I call quarter zips half zips."
04:29;04:34;"Although when you search half zip, you see stuff that's in the ballpark."
04:34;04:36;"Look, here's the thing about zips."
04:36;04:40;"The average consumer, they just want to know, does this go down all the way"
04:40;04:43;"or does this stop somewhere around my nipples?"
04:43;04:47;"You know, nobody's going to send a half zip home saying this is more like a third zip."
04:47;04:49;"Yeah, this is exactly the same level as my nips."
04:49;04:52;"The bottom of it is exactly the same level as your nips?"
04:52;04:53;"Yeah, so there's no such thing."
04:53;04:54;"It should just be called a nip zip."
04:54;04:57;"I'm putting a level on it as we speak."
04:57;04:59;"Confirmed."
04:59;05:04;"Three-quarter zip doesn't exist, but I'm seeing people calling a quarter zip a three-quarter zip."
05:04;05:06;"Oh, because three-quarters are not zipped?"
05:06;05:07;"That's right, yeah."
05:07;05:08;"They're going the opposite way."
05:08;05:10;"I've always been fascinated by the half zip."
05:10;05:13;"It kind of struck me as like--I still actually haven't seen the show,"
05:13;05:15;"but you know, a succession kind of look."
05:15;05:18;"Like a certain type of rich dude wears half zips."
05:18;05:20;"Wow, I should get more half zips, maybe."
05:20;05:21;"You should get more half zips."
05:21;05:23;"But actually, I don't like wearing them that much."
05:23;05:26;"You know, there's this one--and also, this is not a fleece."
05:26;05:28;"It's a sweater, which I think is a little bit different,"
05:28;05:32;"but there's this blue half zip that I got on a music video shoot, and I liked it so much"
05:32;05:36;"I've been wearing it on stage a bunch, and I actually got a second one."
05:36;05:38;"Sweater or fleece?"
05:38;05:39;"A sweater."
05:39;05:40;"On stage?"
05:40;05:41;"Yeah."
05:41;05:42;"Full show?"
05:42;05:46;"Yeah, I realized I don't wear a t-shirt under it, and sometimes I'll wear shorts,"
05:46;05:48;"and I'm like, ""You know what? I'm good, man."""
05:48;05:49;"We've played it."
05:49;05:52;"And as discussed, we've played some very cold shows this year."
05:52;05:53;"Chicago, notably."
05:53;05:54;"Frigid."
05:54;05:56;"I could have been wearing two half zips."
05:56;06:01;"But a fleece half zip, it's interesting because outside of on stage,"
06:01;06:03;"I always want to be able to zip something all the way down."
06:03;06:06;"I don't like taking things on and off over my head in public."
06:06;06:10;"Right, you get the t-shirt tangled up in there."
06:10;06:11;"Hair gets all static-y."
06:11;06:13;"People are like, ""Are you taking your shirt off right now? What's going on?"""
06:13;06:16;"And then also, just like, it's dangerous."
06:16;06:19;"One way or another, you're going to be--even just for a millisecond--"
06:19;06:22;"you're going to be momentarily blinded when you take a half zip off."
06:22;06:25;"Even if you do it in kind of like--you know, not like a little kid,"
06:25;06:28;"like full inside-out, over-the-head way."
06:28;06:30;"You do it in a more grown-up, like gradual, like--"
06:30;06:31;"Yeah."
06:31;06:33;"It's an awkward thing, and I don't like it."
06:33;06:35;"I like to zip all the way down."
06:35;06:36;"And I feel like you feel the same way."
06:36;06:38;"That's why this is not your go-to."
06:38;06:41;"I'm not in love with this shirt. It was a desperate move."
06:41;06:42;"But it does look good. It's a good color."
06:42;06:45;"But I'm glad I brought it because it's frigid in here."
06:45;06:46;"Yeah."
06:46;06:47;"Why do people keep everything so cold?"
06:47;06:48;"I don't know."
06:48;06:50;"It's so hard to find, like, a middle ground."
06:50;06:52;"I keep the house at 77."
06:52;06:55;"That's very warm, especially in L.A."
06:55;06:57;"Yeah, but it feels cool if it's 90 degrees out."
06:57;06:59;"You go inside, it's 77. It feels great."
06:59;07:02;"And then, you know, naturally, it'll drop to about 72, 73"
07:02;07:04;"over the course of the night."
07:04;07:05;"Right."
07:05;07:06;"Ceiling fan?"
07:06;07:07;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
07:07;07:09;"Go to sleep, and it's like 75 in the house with a ceiling fan."
07:09;07:10;"You're golden."
07:56;08:01;"♪ On me, baby ♪"
08:01;08:04;"♪ Goddamn, I am ♪"
08:04;08:09;"♪ I can't sing and hear me, know me ♪"
08:09;08:15;"♪ If you want to destroy my sweater ♪"
08:15;08:20;"♪ Hold this thread as I walk away ♪"
08:22;08:24;"- All right, well, what do we want to talk about today?"
08:24;08:25;"- Great question."
08:25;08:26;"Epstein?"
08:26;08:31;"- I just did a Q and A for the Time Crisis Wiki."
08:31;08:32;"- Oh, really?"
08:32;08:33;"- Yeah."
08:33;08:34;"- The website?"
08:34;08:35;"- That's what it is, a website, right?"
08:35;08:37;"What's it called, TCU?"
08:37;08:39;"- Universe Wiki."
08:39;08:42;"- Wait, is it the Wikipedia page or is it the?"
08:42;08:43;"- No, no, no."
08:43;08:44;"- It is like another thing?"
08:44;08:46;"- I thought somebody made a Wiki for Time Crisis."
08:46;08:47;"- Yeah, it's like--"
08:47;08:50;"- Or not a Wikipedia page, but a Time Crisis Wiki."
08:50;08:52;"- It's the Time Crisis Universe."
08:52;08:53;"- What's the difference between the Time Crisis Wiki"
08:53;08:55;"and the Wikipedia page?"
08:55;08:59;"- A Wiki is like a format for a kind of website."
08:59;09:01;"So, you know, you could do for something, you know,"
09:01;09:05;"a Star Wars Wiki that's like the whole thing"
09:05;09:07;"is about Star Wars."
09:07;09:08;"- Yeah."
09:08;09:09;"- Has nothing to do with Wikipedia."
09:09;09:11;"It's almost like you build your own Wikipedia"
09:11;09:12;"about whatever you want."
09:12;09:13;"- Gotcha."
09:13;09:14;"- So is that what it is?"
09:14;09:16;"- Yeah, yeah."
09:16;09:16;"No, you nailed it."
09:16;09:21;"It's the Time Crisis Universe Wiki through fandom.com."
09:21;09:23;"- Yeah, I did a Q&A 'cause somebody who runs it"
09:23;09:25;"hit me up on Instagram and I thought, you know,"
09:25;09:28;"they're providing real service for the fan community."
09:28;09:29;"Must take a lot of work, right?"
09:29;09:31;"- Was this over like DM, email?"
09:31;09:33;"- They DM me and then I had them, you know,"
09:33;09:36;"email one of my associates to pass on."
09:36;09:38;"- What sort of questions did they have?"
09:38;09:40;"- One of them was how do you guys prepare?"
09:40;09:41;"And I kept it real."
09:41;09:43;"We don't really prepare, but the producers prepare."
09:43;09:45;"They give us information."
09:45;09:46;"- Print out emails from--"
09:46;09:47;"- Yeah."
09:47;09:48;"- Listeners and--"
09:48;09:50;"- It would be incorrect to say that there's no preparation"
09:50;09:51;"for this show."
09:51;09:53;"Just Jake and I do very little of it."
09:53;09:56;"And the truth is we have the Time Crisis text thread"
09:56;09:58;"to talk about topics."
09:58;10:02;"- I feel like there's almost daily additions"
10:02;10:05;"to the Time Crisis either email thread or text thread."
10:05;10:06;"- Yeah."
10:06;10:08;"- Which is you and I, Nick and Seinfeld,"
10:08;10:09;"and then Matt and Colin."
10:09;10:10;"- That's right."
10:10;10:11;"- That's like six people."
10:11;10:12;"- Yeah."
10:12;10:13;"- Deep thread."
10:13;10:15;"- And the truth is if we ever like, you know,"
10:15;10:16;"we ever got in trouble with Apple,"
10:16;10:19;"and they're just like, ""Guys, this show's a mess."
10:19;10:20;"""You're all over the place."""
10:20;10:22;"We want you coming in with, you know,"
10:22;10:25;"seven to 10 topics every single time,"
10:25;10:27;"and we want you to move quickly through them."
10:27;10:29;"The listeners don't like these tangents."
10:29;10:30;"We're gonna produce short little segments."
10:30;10:31;"- Professional-like."
10:31;10:32;"- Very professional."
10:32;10:36;"Every week there's a plethora of Time Crisis-esque."
10:36;10:37;"We can't even keep track."
10:37;10:39;"There's so much Time Crisis stuff in the universe."
10:39;10:40;"- Yeah."
10:40;10:43;"- Like stuff sounds like it's made for Time Crisis."
10:43;10:44;"Sometimes it's not particularly Time Crisis."
10:44;10:47;"Like you brought up Jeffrey Epstein."
10:47;10:49;"We got an email from somebody."
10:49;10:51;"Who's that email from?"
10:51;10:53;"- I sent a text to the thread."
10:53;10:56;"There was a Stereogum article about Mark Foster."
10:56;10:56;"- Oh yeah."
10:56;11:00;"- From Foster the People going in on some like,"
11:00;11:02;"kind of deep-end conspiracy theories."
11:02;11:04;"Body double, Epstein's still alive."
11:04;11:07;"He's in Saudi Arabia getting plastic surgery."
11:07;11:08;"- A lot of people."
11:08;11:10;"- Like some serious face-off kind of stuff."
11:10;11:11;"And then we got an email."
11:11;11:13;"- From Kyle, Kyle Santilli."
11:13;11:14;"- What did he say?"
11:14;11:17;"- Well he said his two favorite things to listen to"
11:17;11:19;"is number one, Come Town."
11:19;11:20;"- Right."
11:20;11:21;"- Which is a podcast."
11:21;11:23;"And then he also likes Time Crisis."
11:23;11:25;"And you know, my understanding is Come Town."
11:25;11:29;"And I've been aware of some of these guys via Twitter."
11:29;11:31;"Always seem like funny, smart dudes."
11:31;11:33;"And I know people who swear by the show."
11:33;11:35;"I don't listen to that many podcasts period though."
11:35;11:37;"One day I'll listen to it from front to back, I'm sure."
11:37;11:40;"- I feel like on the road you'd have time, right?"
11:40;11:41;"- If I was driving, but that's the thing."
11:41;11:43;"I think the best times to listen to podcasts"
11:43;11:44;"are when you're driving."
11:44;11:45;"- Right."
11:45;11:47;"- Here and there, if somebody really tells me"
11:47;11:49;"to listen to something, I might have it on the plane."
11:49;11:51;"But I don't know, there's something about,"
11:51;11:53;"I'm used to being entertained all the time."
11:53;11:54;"I'm like, okay, the plane."
11:54;11:55;"- Oh, movie."
11:55;11:56;"- I'm gonna be watching a movie."
11:56;11:58;"I'm gonna have my iPad loaded up"
11:58;12:02;"with a very engaging TV series."
12:02;12:04;"And then so the idea of--"
12:04;12:08;"- The idea of like a poorly recorded podcast."
12:08;12:10;"- Just like staring at the seat in front of me."
12:10;12:11;"Eh."
12:11;12:13;"- I mean, no, but maybe I could get into it."
12:13;12:15;"Like I think we've talked about this before, Jake."
12:15;12:18;"You have the ultimate job for a podcast listener."
12:18;12:20;"- Oh yeah, I'm big into pods."
12:20;12:20;"I'm painting all day."
12:20;12:21;"- 'Cause you're painting all day."
12:21;12:22;"- Yeah."
12:22;12:23;"- How often do you listen to music even?"
12:23;12:25;"- It's just a mood thing."
12:25;12:26;"- Yeah."
12:26;12:27;"- I'll throw in music."
12:27;12:28;"I've been doing a lot of Silver Jews last week."
12:28;12:29;"- Right."
12:29;12:31;"- I'll do like an hour or two of music a day"
12:31;12:34;"and maybe three or four hours of pods."
12:34;12:35;"- So you're listening to like--"
12:35;12:36;"- I'm all over the place."
12:36;12:38;"I subscribe to like dozens and dozens of pods."
12:38;12:42;"- You listen to 15 to 25 hours of pods a week."
12:42;12:43;"- Oh, easy."
12:43;12:45;"- And what's your absolute fav?"
12:45;12:46;"- I don't have one."
12:46;12:47;"- All depends on your mood."
12:47;12:49;"- I love Chapo."
12:49;12:51;"I love Bill Simmons."
12:51;12:52;"What else do I like?"
12:52;12:53;"Oh, I love Red Scare."
12:53;12:55;"Nick turned me on to Red Scare."
12:55;12:56;"- You listen to Joe Rogan?"
12:56;12:57;"- I do listen to Rogan."
12:57;12:59;"I listen to Bernie on Rogan."
12:59;12:59;"Good ep."
12:59;13:00;"I subscribe to Rogan."
13:00;13:01;"I'll check in."
13:01;13:02;"I listen to maybe one out of every--"
13:02;13:04;"- Oh, I'd like to hear Bernie on Rogan."
13:04;13:06;"- Maybe one out of every five or six episodes."
13:06;13:08;"I mean, you've heard the talking points from--"
13:08;13:09;"- Yeah, yeah."
13:09;13:09;"- Bernie."
13:09;13:11;"- Yeah, maybe it's not that interesting."
13:11;13:12;"- Okay."
13:12;13:13;"- It's kind of, it's an interesting collision"
13:13;13:14;"of personalities."
13:14;13:16;"- The dude who emailed, he,"
13:16;13:17;"and so from what I understand,"
13:17;13:21;"Comptown, the Epstein story, conspiracy, scandal,"
13:21;13:23;"it's like super up their alley."
13:23;13:24;"You know, I'm sure that's like Christmas"
13:24;13:27;"for their listeners."
13:27;13:29;"You know, it's like, that's the type of specific,"
13:29;13:32;"you know, weirdo story that they're into."
13:32;13:34;"But this guy's like, ""You guys should talk about it too."""
13:34;13:37;"It was like, you know, and I kind of appreciated that."
13:37;13:39;"- I get that, you're into two different things"
13:39;13:42;"and you're like, ""Why don't you guys talk about it too?"""
13:42;13:45;"But yeah, I mean, what's the time crisis angle here?"
13:45;13:46;"I think you had a good one, Jake."
13:46;13:49;"It's that you said Mark Foster from Foster the People,"
13:49;13:51;"who I like, you know, I know him personally."
13:51;13:53;"- Was he at the Bernie thing in Iowa?"
13:53;13:54;"- Yes."
13:54;13:55;"- Okay, he was."
13:55;13:57;"- I'd met him here and there over the years,"
13:57;13:59;"but I think the Bernie thing was the first time"
13:59;14:00;"I like really talked to him."
14:00;14:01;"We all went out to a bar afterwards"
14:01;14:03;"and I was like, ""Hell yeah."""
14:03;14:05;"- We did, just for listeners who don't know,"
14:05;14:10;"we did an episode in January of '16 from Iowa"
14:10;14:12;"when Bernie was there speaking."
14:12;14:13;"- Yeah."
14:13;14:15;"- And then we played music and--"
14:15;14:18;"- Yeah, and Mark performed too."
14:18;14:19;"And I think he was just out there also"
14:19;14:22;"just doing some campaigning, knocking on doors and stuff."
14:22;14:25;"But I guess he or somebody in the Foster the People"
14:25;14:29;"organization has been chiming in on the Epstein saga"
14:29;14:33;"and specifically thinks that he is still alive,"
14:33;14:35;"the corpse is a body double,"
14:35;14:38;"and is getting plastic surgery in Saudi Arabia specifically."
14:38;14:40;"- Yes, that's what I saw."
14:40;14:42;"The best part of the thread though was,"
14:42;14:45;"quote, ""Do your own research."""
14:45;14:47;"Which I love when people tell me to do my own research"
14:47;14:52;"on massive global news events that I'm nowhere near."
14:52;14:53;"Do you mean like look at Twitter?"
14:53;14:54;"What do you--"
14:54;14:56;"- Right, it's not like you're watching a cooking show"
14:56;14:58;"and they're just like, ""This is how much sugar I put in,"
14:58;15:00;"""but you know what, you figure it out."
15:00;15:01;"""You do it to taste."
15:01;15:04;"""You're not gonna nail this recipe the first time,"
15:04;15:08;"""but just do some research."""
15:08;15:11;"I mean, obviously there's something fishy about the story,"
15:11;15:13;"although it's all like an odds game, right?"
15:13;15:17;"Many, many global events seem fishy,"
15:17;15:19;"and it doesn't mean that the official events"
15:19;15:22;"are absolutely impossible."
15:22;15:23;"It's a question of how likely are they?"
15:23;15:25;"Is it a four out of five probability they're true"
15:25;15:27;"or is it more like a one out of 10?"

16:30;16:32;"That's a tough one because for most people,"
16:32;16:35;"research involves being extremely online,"
16:35;16:39;"which it's very hard to research the truth on the internet"
16:39;16:41;"because you'll find so many people saying different things"
16:41;16:42;"that are the truth."
16:42;16:44;"- You'll find things that you want to find."
16:44;16:46;"- Yeah, so then to do your own research"
16:46;16:48;"sounds like some like Alex Jones man on the street,"
16:48;16:49;"just like at the prison in Manhattan."
16:49;16:50;"- I've seen the documents."
16:50;16:52;"- Yeah, standing in front of his townhouse"
16:52;16:54;"on the Upper East Side."
16:54;16:55;"Let me in."
16:55;16:57;"I'm a citizen journalist."
16:57;16:59;"I have a petition here,"
16:59;17:02;"e-signed by over 1000 people on Twitter"
17:02;17:06;"demanding that I come in there, sir."
17:06;17:09;"- Yeah, obviously the Epstein death seems fishy as hell."
17:09;17:10;"- Yeah."
17:10;17:12;"- In case people are confused by our tone."
17:12;17:15;"I don't think he's getting facial reconstruction surgery."
17:15;17:17;"- Hey, I believe that anything's possible,"
17:17;17:19;"but I just do want to say something."
17:19;17:22;"And like I said, I like Mark and I respect him,"
17:22;17:25;"but just in terms of his advice,"
17:25;17:27;"and he's totally in his right to give his advice,"
17:27;17:29;"but I want to say to all the Foster the People fans"
17:29;17:31;"and the Imagine Dragons fans,"
17:31;17:32;"because you know, they squash their beef."
17:32;17:33;"- Full circle."
17:33;17:35;"- So because Mark is one of the only people"
17:35;17:38;"who had the balls to apologize to Dan from Imagine Dragons,"
17:38;17:40;"I think there's probably a lot of Imagine Dragons fans"
17:40;17:41;"who said, you know what?"
17:41;17:43;"We're still waiting on the guy from 1975,"
17:43;17:45;"but we're going to follow Mark Foster"
17:45;17:46;"because he's a good dude."
17:46;17:47;"- I like the cut of his jib."
17:47;17:48;"- I like the cut of his jib."
17:48;17:51;"And you know what, sometimes you can trust somebody"
17:51;17:53;"even more when they admit they're wrong."
17:53;17:55;"You know, virtue untested."
17:55;17:57;"Is it really virtue at all, man?"
17:57;17:58;"But Mark's virtue was tested."
17:58;17:59;"Somebody said, you know what?"
17:59;18:01;"You hurt my feelings."
18:01;18:02;"And Mark said, you know what?"
18:02;18:02;"You're right."
18:02;18:04;"And he checked himself and he apologized."
18:04;18:07;"So anyway, I'm more concerned about the Imagine Dragons fans"
18:07;18:09;"who now probably follow him."
18:09;18:12;"Don't fly to Saudi Arabia to try to figure this out."
18:12;18:14;"A, you probably, do you speak Arabic?"
18:14;18:15;"I don't know."
18:15;18:17;"How are you going to get around?"
18:17;18:19;"B, I don't know if it's a smart idea"
18:19;18:21;"for a citizen to go to another country"
18:21;18:23;"and start poking their nose around."
18:23;18:25;"I mean, if this really goes all the way to the top,"
18:25;18:27;"I just don't think you should do it."
18:27;18:29;"- Not gonna like what you find."
18:29;18:31;"- That would be like, God."
18:31;18:33;"That'd be like so brutal."
18:33;18:37;"Just like, with the number one Foster the People fan"
18:37;18:40;"in Brazil who runs like the Foster the People Brazil account"
18:40;18:42;"just like flies to Saudi Arabia,"
18:42;18:45;"tries to break in somewhere, immediately in prison,"
18:45;18:48;"got international situation on our hands."
18:48;18:49;"And I know, Mark's a good guy."
18:49;18:50;"He would feel terrible just like he felt bad"
18:50;18:52;"about the Imagine Dragons beef."
18:52;18:55;"But I'm just saying, do your own research has limits."
18:55;18:56;"And in some ways it's impossible."
18:56;18:58;"- The thing that I think is interesting about this,"
18:58;18:59;"this is the tweet."
18:59;19:03;"What he's saying that's really applicable to you"
19:03;19:05;"is that more than ever, artists need to speak up"
19:05;19:07;"because they're not getting paid by sponsors"
19:07;19:09;"or told how to spin a story by their bosses."
19:09;19:11;"Rupert Murdoch isn't controlling their narrative."
19:11;19:14;"Support your artists, support real journalism,"
19:14;19:16;"fact check everything, do your own research."
19:16;19:19;"Really what he's saying is the musicians, the artists,"
19:19;19:21;"should be the citizen journalists."
19:21;19:23;"- I love the jump from, wait, what was it?"
19:23;19:26;"Support artists do real journalism?"
19:26;19:27;"- Yeah. - Two different professions."
19:27;19:29;"- No, but I know what he means."
19:29;19:31;"Man, ah man, I wish we'd thought about this before."
19:31;19:32;"This is my bad."
19:32;19:34;"I would actually love to get Mark on the phone."
19:34;19:37;"- Well, this is classic not prepping for the show."
19:37;19:38;"- This is what happens when we don't prep."
19:38;19:39;"- We don't prep."
19:39;19:40;"- All right, I'll see if we can get him on the phone."
19:40;19:41;"- Well, let's get Mark on the next one."
19:41;19:42;"- Let's try to get him on for the next one."
19:42;19:43;"- Let's have the show rolls."
19:43;19:46;"- Yeah, 'cause I'd love to hear more of what he has to say."
19:46;19:48;"'Cause it's true up to a point."
19:48;19:50;"I mean, most artists, Mark, myself included,"
19:50;19:53;"we've made money in some sense from sponsorship"
19:53;19:55;"of some type of major corporation."
19:55;19:58;"The whole music world is sponsored."
19:58;19:59;"And even if you're not sponsored,"
19:59;20:02;"you're written about on websites that are sponsored."
20:02;20:04;"The only people who are fully outside that ecosystem"
20:04;20:07;"are some true DIY types."
20:07;20:09;"But I know what he means."
20:09;20:11;"He's saying speak up."
20:11;20:14;"Yeah, the tough part of living in these troubled times"
20:14;20:16;"is that that's what everybody's saying."
20:16;20:18;"- Speak up?"
20:18;20:19;"- He's 100% correct."
20:19;20:21;"But this idea that you're saying,"
20:21;20:24;"listen, you can't trust most of what's going on."
20:24;20:25;"And me, I'm a straight shooter."
20:25;20:29;"And here's why those other people are compromised"
20:29;20:30;"or they're cowardly."
20:30;20:31;"You know, that's why you gotta trust me."
20:31;20:33;"It's the same thing that Trump says,"
20:33;20:36;"Alex Jones says, Glenn Greenwald,"
20:36;20:38;"somebody who I actually agree with most of the time."
20:38;20:39;"You know, I'm just saying, it's like,"
20:39;20:42;"that alone is not enough to convince somebody"
20:42;20:44;"because everybody kind of believes"
20:44;20:47;"that's what they're doing a little bit."
20:47;20:47;"- Damn."
20:47;20:49;"- I don't think we're ever gonna get to the bottom of this."
20:49;20:52;"I mean, you know, I'm very familiar with 9/11 conspiracies"
20:52;20:54;"because I've known all sorts of people"
20:54;20:55;"who feel very strongly about it."
20:55;20:59;"It's, you know, and I've always been like open-minded."
20:59;21:00;"Like, lay it on me, man."
21:00;21:01;"Tell me what happened."
21:01;21:02;"- Tower seven, dog."
21:02;21:04;"- Yeah, some people, and I've always been kind of like,"
21:04;21:05;"you know what, man?"
21:05;21:07;"At the end of the day, you might be right."
21:07;21:08;"I've never been some like,"
21:08;21:10;"you gotta trust the official narrative person."
21:10;21:12;"- What's your vibe with JFK?"
21:12;21:15;"- Totally could have been killed by the mafias."
21:15;21:16;"That what people think."
21:16;21:18;"That's one of the theories."
21:18;21:19;"- Yeah, I mean, the CIA, the mafia."
21:19;21:21;"- That's partially what the upcoming Martin Scorsese film"
21:21;21:22;"The Irishman's about, I think."
21:22;21:23;"- Oh, really?"
21:23;21:25;"- I think there's like a JFK connection."
21:25;21:26;"- Wow, I didn't realize that."
21:26;21:27;"I haven't seen the trailer."
21:27;21:28;"- All I saw was the trailer."
21:28;21:33;"- I went to the JFK museum in Dallas a year or two ago,"
21:33;21:37;"and the tour ends at the window that the shots were--"
21:37;21:38;"- What's it called, Daly Plaza or something?"
21:38;21:39;"- Daly Plaza."
21:39;21:40;"- Daly Plaza."
21:40;21:41;"- I'm not a marksman."
21:41;21:45;"I'm not experienced with riflery or guns,"
21:45;21:48;"but I was shocked how close it was,"
21:48;21:51;"like from the window that he supposedly killed JFK from,"
21:51;21:54;"down to where there was an X on the road where the car was."
21:54;21:56;"- Oh, so you looked out the window and you were just like,"
21:56;21:57;"oh, easy."
21:57;21:58;"- Easy, yeah."
21:58;22:00;"But then again, I don't know anything about"
22:00;22:04;"reloading a single bolt rifle."
22:04;22:05;"I don't know anything about that."
22:05;22:08;"And obviously Jack Ruby seems like a major"
22:08;22:10;"weird wild card in this story."
22:10;22:13;"But just standing in the window and looking down,"
22:13;22:15;"I was like, that seems easy."
22:15;22:17;"- Just like point blank pretty much at that point."
22:17;22:19;"- I mean, it seems pretty easy."
22:19;22:21;"Like they said in JFK, it's a turkey shoot."
22:21;22:24;"- Great film."
22:24;22:25;"- Never saw it."
22:25;22:25;"- Really?"
22:25;22:28;"- Well, you know what, Jake, I gotta say though."
22:28;22:31;"I gotta say though, to Mark's point,"
22:31;22:32;"you went and did the goddamn research."
22:32;22:33;"- I did my own research."
22:33;22:33;"- Jake did the research."
22:33;22:34;"- No, but I didn't."
22:34;22:37;"I don't know anything about shooting a gun."
22:37;22:39;"- You just kind of made like a gun with your hand"
22:39;22:41;"and closed one eye and just looked down"
22:41;22:43;"and you're just like, pow."
22:43;22:45;"- Sir, could you move on?"
22:46;22:48;"- Oh God, imagine the types of weird,"
22:48;22:49;"imagine just being like."
22:49;22:51;"- Oh my God, can you imagine the (beep)"
22:51;22:53;"just being a tour guide there?"
22:53;22:55;"The people that, well, everyone has an audio guide."
22:55;22:58;"It's like a mandatory audio guide, as I recall."
22:58;22:59;"- Mandatory?"
22:59;23:00;"- And so you're just like, yeah."
23:00;23:01;"- Oh, 'cause they want, you gotta listen"
23:01;23:03;"to the official narrative, that's why."
23:03;23:06;"- Well, no, but they get into like the conspiracy theories"
23:06;23:09;"at the museum, but I think maybe just to like manage"
23:09;23:11;"the traffic flow or whatever, but there must be"
23:11;23:14;"just like super Walter Sobchak style dudes."
23:14;23:15;"- Yeah."
23:15;23:16;"- Supposed to put that window with like,"
23:16;23:19;"I've actually brought a replica of the gun"
23:19;23:21;"that Oswald's supposed to be had."
23:21;23:22;"- Oh, I'm sure there's just so much"
23:22;23:24;"like unwanted conversation too."
23:24;23:28;"Just like, you know, like some old couple"
23:28;23:31;"and just like the Walter type dude just being like,"
23:31;23:33;"ha, you don't believe that horse (beep) do you?"
23:33;23:35;"And they're just like, what do you mean?"
23:35;23:36;"And you're just like, there's no way"
23:36;23:38;"that the official narrative is true."
23:38;23:41;"It's like, oh, okay, all right."
23:41;23:43;"- Maybe that's why they have the mandatory audio tour."
23:43;23:45;"- There's just too many people talking to each other."
23:45;23:45;"- It's weird."
23:45;23:46;"- Yeah."

25:18;25:22;"- Well, the way I always felt about 9/11,"
25:22;25:24;"this is a very strange Time Crisis episode too."
25:24;25:26;"It's off to a totally different tone."
25:26;25:28;"The way I always felt about 9/11 was"
25:28;25:30;"when I'd meet people who very passionately felt"
25:30;25:32;"that the official narrative could not be true."
25:32;25:35;"And people would show me certain evidence about,"
25:35;25:38;"well, why did Tower 7 fall?"
25:38;25:41;"There's actually a great song that Megan Amram."
25:41;25:42;"- Who's that again?"
25:42;25:44;"- Megan is a--"
25:44;25:45;"- Is she a soccer player?"
25:45;25:46;"- Megan Rappinoe."
25:46;25:47;"- She may have played soccer,"
25:47;25:49;"but I'll have to check on that one."
25:49;25:51;"No, Megan Amram is a great,"
25:51;25:53;"well, she's a writer first and foremost."
25:53;25:55;"She's written stuff for the New Yorker,"
25:55;25:57;"but she's best known as a TV writer."
25:57;25:59;"She's one of the big writers on The Good Place,"
25:59;26:01;"and before that she was at Parks and Rec,"
26:01;26:04;"and she's written for Silicon Valley and The Simpsons,"
26:04;26:06;"and she's been a friend for a long time."
26:06;26:08;"Very smart, very funny person."
26:08;26:10;"And so she was really big into this song"
26:10;26:13;"that this guy made that's actually a very catchy song."
26:13;26:15;"So I warn you."
26:15;26:17;"- Oh, wait, dude, is this, was this in Catatonicues?"
26:17;26:18;"- Yeah, he posted it."
26:18;26:22;"But yeah, Catatonicues posted this,"
26:22;26:23;"but I have to shout out Megan."
26:23;26:24;"She literally, she put me and Nick"
26:24;26:26;"onto this maybe five years ago."
26:26;26:27;"- Oh, wow, okay."
26:27;26:29;"- So she was very early, like when this dude had no views."
26:29;26:31;"He's, I think he's Australian."
26:31;26:33;"- It's like hella poppy, right?"
26:33;26:33;"- It's very catchy."
26:33;26:36;"Even without looking at it, I haven't heard it in a year,"
26:36;26:38;"or whatever, I saw it briefly on Catatonics."

28:31;28:34;"- I'm actually fairly familiar with this conspiracy theory"
28:34;28:36;"or alternate theory."
28:36;28:39;"- I know the theory, like the fire can't melt steel,"
28:39;28:41;"but it's like, dude, if you have like thousands of gallons"
28:41;28:45;"of like jet fuel exploding, it's sort of like,"
28:45;28:46;"is that, that's not like a--"
28:46;28:47;"- I'm hesitant to send anybody down this rabbit hole,"
28:47;28:49;"but basically, of course we're familiar with what happened"
28:49;28:51;"with the World Trade Center 1 and 2."
28:51;28:52;"- Yeah."
28:52;28:55;"- And there's footage, again, you can believe"
28:55;28:56;"an alternate theory if you want to,"
28:56;28:59;"that those planes did not have passengers on them"
28:59;29:00;"or weren't actually commercial,"
29:00;29:02;"or there's all sorts of alternate theories"
29:02;29:05;"or that there were already bombs in the building somehow"
29:05;29:08;"to take the plane crash and turn into something bigger."
29:08;29:11;"Okay, but at least we're familiar with what happened there."
29:11;29:12;"There was this other building,"
29:12;29:15;"which I remember watching fall on TV."
29:15;29:16;"I was over at my friend's house"
29:16;29:17;"'cause they let us out of school."
29:17;29:19;"And so we were sitting there watching it"
29:19;29:20;"and they were like, oh, that one's gonna go."
29:20;29:21;"And then it fell."
29:21;29:25;"That's become a major point for 9/11 conspiracy theorists"
29:25;29:28;"because they're like, okay, if you sheeple wanna believe"
29:28;29:29;"that 1 and 2 fell because of planes,"
29:29;29:31;"we don't believe that, but whatever."
29:31;29:33;"But look at Building 7."
29:33;29:35;"There was no serious structural damage,"
29:35;29:37;"no plane flew into it."
29:37;29:39;"Why did it fall and why did it fall like that?"
29:39;29:42;"So when he says the building fell with such precision,"
29:42;29:44;"free fall speed, no reasons given,"
29:44;29:48;"the conspiracy theorists are saying that building fell"
29:48;29:49;"when they demolish an old building,"
29:49;29:51;"the way they load up bombs or something."
29:51;29:54;"That's this thing people say,"
29:54;29:56;"if a building was just keeling over,"
29:56;29:57;"it might fall down in some awkward way."
29:57;29:59;"This fell down free fall speed,"
29:59;30:01;"like as if there was no resistance."
30:01;30:02;"Demoed."
30:02;30:04;"So anyway, that's an important part of the story."
30:04;30:06;"And so people talked about that with me and I said,"
30:06;30:07;"yeah, you know, that's weird."
30:07;30:08;"That's weird, man."
30:08;30:09;"It is kind of shady."
30:09;30:10;"- But if it was a conspiracy"
30:10;30:13;"and they wanted to detonate the two trade centers"
30:13;30:15;"to start the war with Iraq,"
30:15;30:19;"it's like, why detonate Building 7 too?"
30:19;30:21;"You're just gonna stir up conspiracies."
30:21;30:24;"Like the whole point, keep it clean if you're gonna do it."
30:24;30:26;"- The theory is that by doing that,"
30:26;30:28;"they destroyed information."
30:28;30:30;"- Oh, information."
30:30;30:31;"I'm not a 9/11 truther."
30:31;30:33;"I'm super out with that theory."
30:33;30:34;"You heard it here, folks."
30:34;30:37;"- Jake's takes on time crisis."
30:37;30:40;"- And again, specifically about that, why did that fall?"
30:40;30:42;"I don't know, man."
30:42;30:43;"- Yeah."
30:43;30:45;"- But my larger point about that one,"
30:45;30:47;"and that one I have a more clear cut feeling"
30:47;30:50;"because I remember that I was a senior in high school"
30:50;30:52;"when 9/11 happened."
30:52;30:54;"And you know, it's in the town I grew up in,"
30:54;30:55;"I grew up in a very small town"
30:55;30:58;"and there were like 11 people died in the town."
30:58;31:00;"- Wow, from your town?"
31:00;31:01;"- Yeah."
31:01;31:02;"- There were commuters?"
31:02;31:05;"- Yeah, there's a plaque in the town for a bunch of people."
31:05;31:06;"Remember my dad was on his way to work"
31:06;31:07;"in Manhattan that day."
31:07;31:08;"So anyway, that happened."
31:08;31:11;"It was like this kind of really dark emotional thing,"
31:11;31:13;"obviously for many, many people."
31:13;31:14;"And then I remember though,"
31:14;31:16;"then the next year I'm a freshman in college"
31:16;31:20;"and that's when there was the big no war march"
31:20;31:22;"or anti-war march in New York."
31:22;31:24;"And I kind of remember being like,"
31:24;31:26;"I'd never been in a crowd that big before."
31:26;31:28;"So I only like met up with some friends and we went down"
31:28;31:29;"and it was just like,"
31:29;31:31;"I think it was a million people on the streets."
31:31;31:34;"It was truly one of the biggest protests"
31:34;31:37;"that's ever happened, at least in New York City."
31:37;31:39;"And I just remember like looking at so many people"
31:39;31:40;"and just being like, and again,"
31:40;31:43;"there wasn't like a 9/11 conspiracy presence there."
31:43;31:46;"The vibe of this anti-war march was not,"
31:46;31:50;"guys, we'd be super down if the official story was true."
31:50;31:51;"We just don't want to go to war"
31:51;31:53;"because it's clearly an inside job."
31:53;31:55;"Nobody said that."
31:55;31:56;"The whole point of that was,"
31:56;31:59;"even if you buy the official narrative of 9/11,"
31:59;32:03;"that's still not a good reason to go to war with Iraq"
32:03;32:04;"and the real conspiracy."
32:04;32:08;"- That's why it kills the conspiracy theories."
32:08;32:10;"- Well, it doesn't kill the conspiracy theory"
32:10;32:11;"'cause I like to--"
32:11;32:13;"- The official narrative is so idiotic to begin with."
32:13;32:15;"- Well, I like to give people latitude to be like,"
32:15;32:16;"you know what man, you might be right."
32:16;32:18;"Like, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you"
32:18;32:20;"that I know exactly how buildings should look"
32:20;32:22;"when they fall or something."
32:22;32:24;"The thing we can both agree on"
32:24;32:26;"is that we all got bamboozled by something else."
32:26;32:27;"There's like a--"
32:27;32:28;"- It's way more naked."
32:28;32:30;"- Right, there's a,"
32:30;32:30;"so sometimes I feel like,"
32:30;32:32;"well, we're never gonna know about that for sure"
32:32;32:34;"and I'm not gonna be condescending and be like,"
32:34;32:37;"well, I read in the New York Times that, you know,"
32:37;32:38;"this is what happened, or 'cause I read the looming tower,"
32:38;32:41;"I know exactly, you know, that's not my vibe."
32:41;32:43;"I'm kind of a live and let live type dude."
32:43;32:44;"But I'll just say,"
32:44;32:46;"but I'll say I'm pretty sure"
32:46;32:47;"we'll never know what happened though."
32:47;32:49;"And isn't it kind of funny that,"
32:49;32:50;"I'll know one thing for sure,"
32:50;32:52;"I stood in a crowd of a million people"
32:52;32:55;"saying we don't wanna go to a war and we still did."
32:55;32:57;"Well, that's not even a conspiracy theory."
32:57;32:59;"That's just the terrible way that things work."
32:59;33:01;"- Well, it's just like the Epstein thing,"
33:01;33:02;"like to go full circle."
33:02;33:04;"I mean, assuming, you know,"
33:04;33:07;"him committing suicide seems pretty fishy."
33:07;33:09;"So it seems pretty like bald,"
33:09;33:13;"nakedly sort of like power hungry just to be like,"
33:13;33:14;"oh yeah, he committed suicide, right?"
33:14;33:16;"That's the narrative, believe it."
33:16;33:17;"- Right."
33:17;33:18;"- And everyone's like, really?"
33:18;33:20;"It's like, they don't need to do conspiracies."
33:20;33:21;"That's what I'm saying."
33:21;33:22;"- Well, in a way, it's, well,"
33:22;33:24;"you could still say they needed 9/11"
33:24;33:26;"even to kick off that whole program."
33:26;33:28;"But I guess, yeah, the funny part is that"
33:28;33:33;"people are so stupid or weak willed or immoral or something"
33:33;33:36;"that even without the really crazy conspiracy theories,"
33:36;33:38;"just insane stuff happens all the time."
33:38;33:40;"And you know, I think for me,"
33:40;33:42;"that was like a major moment of disillusionment,"
33:42;33:45;"especially here I am living in New York City."
33:45;33:47;"I'm an adult now"
33:47;33:49;"and I'm watching a million people in the street"
33:49;33:51;"and there's even Democrats voting for the war."
33:51;33:53;"That was definitely some like, whoa,"
33:53;33:55;"the world is like insane."
33:55;33:56;"- I better start a band."
33:56;33:58;"- I better start a band, man."
33:58;34:00;"The world needs some music."
34:00;34:04;"The only thing that's gonna heal this thing is music."
34:04;34:07;"No, but I didn't start the band for a few years."
34:07;34:09;"I was doing original research for the--"
34:09;34:09;"- Right, right, right."
34:09;34:10;"- Up until then."
34:10;34:12;"- Doing your own research."
34:12;34:14;"- I was doing my own research, but yeah."
34:14;34:17;"So I guess my point is sometimes that,"
34:17;34:18;"and I understand why people get fired up"
34:18;34:20;"'cause people wanna know the truth, man."
34:20;34:21;"I get it."
34:21;34:22;"But sometimes it's kinda like,"
34:22;34:26;"well, what's most important is what happens afterwards"
34:26;34:29;"and does it actually logically follow?"
34:29;34:32;"Because even if tomorrow somebody could tell me,"
34:32;34:34;"well, yeah, 9/11, here's how it got done."
34:34;34:36;"There were seven people in the Bush administration"
34:36;34:38;"who got together and they planted the bombs"
34:38;34:39;"and they blah, blah, and they planned it out"
34:39;34:41;"and I'd be like, and a bunch of people admitted"
34:41;34:43;"that like, yo, guilty as charged, man."
34:43;34:45;"This did not involve Osama bin Laden at all."
34:45;34:47;"These countries teamed up and this is, you know,"
34:47;34:48;"secret society."
34:48;34:49;"Either they proved all that stuff--"
34:49;34:50;"- Did Bush know?"
34:50;34:51;"Hell no."
34:51;34:52;"- Oh yeah, probably not Bush."
34:52;34:53;"But even if somebody could prove all that to me,"
34:53;34:55;"I'd be like, damn, that's dark."
34:55;34:58;"But then I'd also be like, but I still can't believe"
34:58;35:00;"we went toward Iraq."
35:00;35:00;"That's the crazy part."
35:00;35:02;"- No, this still shouldn't have worked."
35:02;35:03;"- Like, yeah, if you could prove to me"
35:03;35:07;"that a very small group of powerful people"
35:07;35:09;"did something behind closed doors,"
35:09;35:10;"I'd be like, oh, whoa, okay, that's crazy."
35:10;35:11;"I didn't know that."
35:11;35:13;"But then the stuff that happens in plain sight"
35:13;35:14;"is still even more brutal."
35:14;35:15;"- Yeah."
35:15;35:19;"- It's like, you tell me that there's a bipartisan support"
35:19;35:23;"to go to war in this country that millions of lives lost"
35:23;35:26;"in American and Iraqi."
35:26;35:28;"And so, you know, even with this Epstein thing,"
35:28;35:31;"whether he's alive or not alive or whatever,"
35:31;35:33;"it's kind of like, well, what's gonna happen next?"
35:33;35:35;"That's almost the more important part."
35:35;35:37;"I mean, of course you want justice for people"
35:37;35:38;"who were hurt and abused,"
35:38;35:40;"but many of the people who are talking about it"
35:40;35:43;"don't even seem that particularly concerned about that."
35:43;35:44;"- Right."
35:44;35:46;"- They're more concerned with this global conspiracy"
35:46;35:47;"of like power and stuff."
35:47;35:47;"And it's like, well, all right,"
35:47;35:49;"we're gonna see what happens."
35:49;35:51;"You know, and by the way, Jeff Bezos still not paying tax."
35:51;35:53;"You know, Amazon's not paying taxes."
35:53;35:55;"- Not a single nickel."
35:55;35:57;"- I'm sure Jeff Bezos is, but so yeah,"
35:57;35:59;"I'm not gonna make a personal, but Amazon's not."
35:59;36:02;"- Bezos is paying his personal income tax."
36:02;36:03;"- Yeah."
36:03;36:05;"- Should we finish this terrific song?"
36:05;36:06;"- Oh yeah, this is a great song."
36:06;36:09;"♪ Fire's not enough ♪"
36:09;36:11;"- Such a well-written song."
36:11;36:14;"- What is this guy's other material?"
36:14;36:16;"Like does he have a whole like YouTube channel"
36:16;36:17;"of conspiracy songs?"
36:17;36:20;"- I feel like I looked, he had at least a few other songs,"
36:20;36:23;"but one thing that I was gonna say is that"
36:23;36:25;"clearly this Epstein story is gonna continue"
36:25;36:27;"to have a ripple effect."
36:27;36:30;"Whatever happens, I doubt it's gonna end in like"
36:30;36:34;"global clarity about what, you know, his actual fate."
36:34;36:35;"- Right."
36:35;36:38;"- I have a feeling, a bad feeling, and I said this,"
36:38;36:42;"I was having a conversation with Bayo actually on tour"
36:42;36:46;"before Epstein was found dead, just about the whole story."
36:46;36:48;"And I said, I just have a feeling whatever happens,"
36:48;36:50;"it's gonna be good for Trump."
36:50;36:53;"Because you know, a lot of people looked at this story"
36:53;36:54;"in a partisan way."
36:54;36:56;"If you're a Democrat, you're kind of like--"
36:56;36:58;"- Hashtag Trump body count."
36:58;36:59;"- Trump's going down off this."
36:59;37:02;"And then the Republicans immediately, Clinton body count."
37:02;37:03;"And I just had this feeling, I was like--"
37:03;37:05;"- Both are completely asinine."
37:05;37:07;"- Even if somehow he is implicated,"
37:07;37:10;"trying to cover his own ass and did despicable things,"
37:10;37:14;"the candidate that seems to benefit time and time again"
37:14;37:17;"from anything shady involving the Clinton family,"
37:17;37:20;"even though he's shady, and the candidate who seems"
37:20;37:23;"to benefit from kind of like widespread distrust"
37:23;37:26;"in the system, even though he currently is the president"
37:26;37:29;"of the system, is Donald Trump, you know what I mean?"
37:29;37:32;"So it's like, let's say you did find out that Jeb Ramsay"
37:32;37:34;"was in Saudi Arabia, or that he was murdered,"
37:34;37:36;"and I just don't see it."
37:36;37:39;"It's a bad feeling, but I feel like it's,"
37:39;37:41;"the fact that even Bill Clinton knew him,"
37:41;37:43;"it's like already a win for Trump, kind of."
37:43;37:46;"- Even though Trump partied with him, that's hilarious."
37:46;37:47;"- Because Trump's shameless."
37:47;37:50;"- Yeah, and if you're shameless, that's incredibly powerful."
37:50;37:54;"The other thing is, the election is 15, 16 months out."
37:54;37:56;"This is ancient history by then."
37:56;37:58;"Whatever random dumb story is happening"
37:58;38:02;"in like October of 2020, will have like"
38:02;38:05;"some inordinate effect on whatever happens."
38:05;38:06;"- Right, if there's a recession."
38:06;38:07;"- Right."
38:07;38:08;"- Something like that. - Or whatever."
38:08;38:11;"Just some other billionaire did something dumb."
38:11;38:12;"- Oh, I'm just saying, a recession would actually"
38:12;38:14;"have an impact on Trump, I think."
38:14;38:17;"♪ The state draws near ♪"
38:17;38:22;"♪ And our freedom slips away ♪"
38:22;38:26;"♪ And they don't give a stuff ♪"
38:26;38:30;"♪ They make that clear enough ♪"
38:30;38:35;"♪ So now it's up to us to bring it down ♪"
38:36;38:38;"♪ Down ♪"
38:38;38:40;"- So you know what, we made it happen very quickly."
38:40;38:42;"That's the time crisis away."
38:42;38:44;"We get an idea, we see it through."
38:44;38:47;"As we were talking about Epstein and the tweets,"
38:47;38:50;"we said we should get Mark Foster on the show."
38:50;38:51;"And you know what, he was pretty close by."
38:51;38:52;"We put out the bat signal,"
38:52;38:53;"and now Mark is here in the studio."
38:53;38:54;"What's up, Mark?"
38:54;38:55;"- How you guys doing?"
38:55;38:56;"- Not bad."
38:56;39:00;"So it's funny with Twitter, just like kind of a brief thought"
39:00;39:02;"can turn into something big."
39:02;39:04;"So you were just saying that, you know,"
39:04;39:05;"you woke up the next morning,"
39:05;39:07;"and you were just, the amount of pickup"
39:07;39:09;"about your specific tweet was kind of like shocking."
39:09;39:12;"- Yeah, it was shocking for a number of reasons."
39:12;39:14;"I mean, one that, you know, news articles"
39:14;39:16;"started to pick it up and people started to run with it."
39:16;39:19;"But also that there were a lot of, you know,"
39:19;39:21;"you can check to see like what verified accounts"
39:21;39:23;"are, you know, tagging you, talking to you."
39:23;39:25;"All these verified accounts from like--"
39:25;39:27;"- Across the political spectrum?"
39:27;39:31;"- NBC, CNN, all, yeah, all of these, you know,"
39:31;39:34;"commentators and people that, you know, don't,"
39:34;39:35;"they don't follow the band, they're not fans."
39:35;39:38;"It's not like, and they're all commenting on it."
39:38;39:40;"And it's like, I kicked a hornet's nest."
39:40;39:42;"And so it was kind of like, oh, wow."
39:42;39:44;"So I kind of went deeper on it, I guess,"
39:44;39:46;"as opposed to shying away,"
39:46;39:48;"which is always a tricky thing, I think."
39:48;39:51;"I mean, especially the fact that I use the bands."
39:51;39:53;"I mean, I don't have like a personal Twitter."
39:53;39:55;"And so that's kind of my only voice."
39:55;39:56;"And I don't tweet about things"
39:56;39:58;"that are outside of the music spectrum,"
39:58;40:01;"unless I'm like furious or passionate about something."
40:01;40:03;"- Right, this is one of those things where I was just furious."
40:03;40:05;"- If somebody actually knew you,"
40:05;40:06;"'cause I was talking about how like,"
40:06;40:07;"maybe one of the last times we saw each other"
40:07;40:09;"was campaigning for Bernie in Iowa, right?"
40:09;40:10;"- Yep."
40:10;40:11;"- You're a very politically engaged person"
40:11;40:12;"and following the news and stuff."
40:12;40:15;"So probably somebody who knows you wouldn't be surprised"
40:15;40:16;"that you might have strong feelings"
40:16;40:18;"about like a major event like that."
40:18;40:19;"But yeah, maybe some people just like"
40:19;40:21;"on the official Foster the People account,"
40:21;40:23;"just kind of like, yeah, well,"
40:23;40:24;"what was the tweet before that?"
40:24;40:26;"Like, hey, announcing new tour dates, like."
40:26;40:30;"- Yeah, we like just released a song."
40:30;40:31;"It's one of those things where it's like,"
40:31;40:33;"when I look at like this point in history,"
40:33;40:34;"I guess what makes me furious is that"
40:34;40:37;"it seems like the biggest government coverup"
40:37;40:40;"maybe since Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination."
40:40;40:42;"- Oh, I just gotta say, just 'cause you weren't here,"
40:42;40:43;"we were talking about that."
40:43;40:45;"Jake's been to the plaza in Dallas"
40:45;40:47;"and he kind of looked out the window and he was like,"
40:47;40:48;"it wouldn't be hard to make the shot."
40:48;40:50;"That was Jake's take."
40:50;40:51;"Just a, I don't know."
40:51;40:52;"- I went to the museum, yeah."
40:52;40:53;"- I've been there."
40:53;40:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
40:54;40:55;"- So did you stand at the window?"
40:55;40:57;"- Yeah, the final stop of the tour is the window."
40:57;40:59;"- So when you were eyeballing it from the window,"
40:59;41:00;"were you like?"
41:00;41:02;"- Oh, I mean, no, I don't doubt that he did it."
41:02;41:03;"- Yeah."
41:03;41:04;"- Why?"
41:04;41:05;"- But it's the fact that, you know,"
41:05;41:07;"after 20 hours of being interrogated,"
41:07;41:08;"none of it was released"
41:08;41:10;"and then the seals were filed for 75 years."
41:10;41:11;"And even when like Trump, you know,"
41:11;41:16;"wanted to raise his public, well, you know."
41:16;41:16;"- Oh yeah, I forgot about that."
41:16;41:18;"- Like you said, he was gonna release the Kennedy files"
41:18;41:20;"and then even then he couldn't release them all."
41:20;41:23;"And it's like, if you can't release them all now"
41:23;41:24;"and you're the president,"
41:24;41:25;"then there's something that obviously implicates"
41:25;41:28;"your own government that you don't want people to see."
41:28;41:30;"And so it's like, yeah, it's like."
41:30;41:31;"- Everybody's dead."

42:31;42:34;"- So what is it about this one,"
42:34;42:36;"obviously we live in an insane world"
42:36;42:39;"with injustices and coverups and lies every day."
42:39;42:41;"So what is it about this one that really like,"
42:41;42:44;"you couldn't think anything as crazy"
42:44;42:45;"until going back 50 years?"
42:45;42:48;"- Well, I'd known about Epstein for,"
42:48;42:49;"I've heard about him for a long time."
42:49;42:50;"Like even in the early 2000s,"
42:50;42:53;"I remember hearing about the Lolita Express."
42:53;42:54;"Basically, you know, this guy"
42:54;42:56;"that would take underage girls to his island"
42:56;42:57;"and was friends with all these"
42:57;42:59;"really wealthy and powerful people."
42:59;43:01;"And then he got like busted."
43:01;43:02;"I didn't even know that he got busted."
43:02;43:04;"I just, I remember hearing kind of the rumors"
43:04;43:06;"about this guy a long time ago."
43:06;43:09;"And then it all kind of coming to a head this year."
43:09;43:11;"He gets arrested and I'm like, oh my God,"
43:11;43:13;"you know, like justice is gonna be,"
43:13;43:17;"this guy that's like skated around the law for so long"
43:17;43:19;"that we're actually gonna get some answers."
43:19;43:22;"And I have a million questions, as I'm sure"
43:22;43:25;"a lot of people do, of how this happened."
43:25;43:27;"It's like, if you have this guy who's arguably"
43:27;43:29;"one of the most important witnesses in custody"
43:29;43:31;"in the history of the US,"
43:31;43:35;"because he's got potentially incredibly damaging information"
43:35;43:38;"on two presidents, one currently active,"
43:38;43:40;"and who knows who else, you know,"
43:40;43:41;"you got Prince Andrew in there,"
43:41;43:42;"you've got all these other people"
43:42;43:44;"that have been implicated hanging out"
43:44;43:46;"with Epstein on his island."
43:46;43:47;"And then this happens."
43:47;43:49;"And after Suicide Watch, and then you start to like,"
43:49;43:53;"look at the facts of the guards weren't checking on him."
43:53;43:54;"He was taken off Suicide Watch."
43:54;43:57;"His cellmate was transferred the day before."
43:57;43:58;"- Well, that's one, I think maybe one of the reasons"
43:58;44:03;"why your tweets really got a lot of people talking"
44:03;44:05;"was because when I kind of looked at social media"
44:05;44:07;"and the news the day it came out,"
44:07;44:11;"the vast majority of like independent commentators,"
44:11;44:12;"you know, maybe obviously not like"
44:12;44:13;"the New York Times headliner,"
44:13;44:14;"but the vast majority of independent commentators"
44:14;44:16;"were saying, this is fishy."
44:16;44:18;"I don't believe this guy died."
44:18;44:20;"But you went a step beyond, which is interesting."
44:20;44:22;"And I've been doing some research"
44:22;44:23;"and even I was like looking up about"
44:23;44:25;"this New York Post photo of his body"
44:25;44:28;"being taken into the hospital and comparing it."
44:28;44:30;"And so I was looking at the Snopes article about it,"
44:30;44:32;"and there's the Foster the People tweet"
44:32;44:34;"in the Snopes article about it."
44:34;44:35;"So in some ways you've become,"
44:35;44:37;"whether or not you want it to be,"
44:37;44:39;"you're the voice for that particular theory."
44:39;44:41;"So that's what I'm curious about is,"
44:41;44:43;"was it the photo that set you off?"
44:43;44:45;"'Cause you're like, I don't believe that's the same guy,"
44:45;44:46;"or already you just didn't think--"
44:46;44:47;"- Or did you read something somewhere?"
44:47;44:50;"- No, no, no, I just saw the photo."
44:50;44:51;"And then I saw the side by side."
44:51;44:53;"- What about before you saw the photo?"
44:53;44:55;"Did you already in the back of your head think like,"
44:55;44:56;"I bet he's not even dead?"
44:56;44:59;"- I think you go through all the realm of possibilities"
44:59;45:01;"of like what happened, what could have happened."
45:01;45:04;"But the photo to me, and look, I'm not a forensics expert."
45:04;45:07;"I put out a (beep) tweet, you know what I mean?"
45:07;45:07;"- Right."
45:07;45:11;"- And then like just being a musician"
45:11;45:13;"that wanted to put out a tweet and like start"
45:13;45:15;"a public discourse on this guy."
45:15;45:17;"But it's like you look at the photo"
45:17;45:19;"and it's not the same guy."
45:19;45:21;"And I know that when people die, look--"
45:21;45:23;"- Well, and just to fill everybody in,"
45:23;45:25;"when I looked at the Snopes article,"
45:25;45:28;"and obviously Snopes can't verify it's the same guy,"
45:28;45:29;"but they were just saying,"
45:29;45:30;"here's one thing to keep in mind."
45:30;45:31;"The pictures that were side by side"
45:31;45:33;"were taken 15 years apart,"
45:33;45:34;"and they're from different sides of his face."
45:34;45:37;"So maybe, that's how they kind of put it."
45:37;45:39;"They weren't coming down hard one way or the other."
45:39;45:40;"- 15 years apart, sure, but I mean,"
45:40;45:42;"even the photos of Epstein"
45:42;45:45;"when he was arrested in court recently."
45:45;45:47;"Are there some profile shots that--"
45:47;45:49;"- I mean, there's some head-on shots."
45:49;45:51;"There's not like a profile shot that you can A/B."
45:51;45:52;"But even the head-on shot,"
45:52;45:55;"like he looks much younger than the guy."
45:55;45:56;"The nose is different."
45:56;45:59;"He's got deep lines around his mouth."
45:59;46:02;"And the photo of the guy that's on the stretcher"
46:02;46:05;"or whatever, just said they don't exist."
46:05;46:06;"And I could be wrong."
46:06;46:08;"It could be him, and I know that like when you die,"
46:08;46:10;"things change, you physically change."
46:10;46:13;"- And sometimes people look really different"
46:13;46:14;"from photo to photo."
46:14;46:15;"- Sure. - Do you know what I mean?"
46:15;46:16;"- Sure."
46:16;46:19;"- Sometimes you're like, ""That's me?"""
46:19;46:20;"- Sure, totally. - You know, I don't know."
46:20;46:23;"- I mean, I think I'm not gonna like hang my hat up"
46:23;46:26;"and say like, ""I believe that the body was switched,"""
46:26;46:28;"and like, you know, stand by that."
46:28;46:30;"- Right, you were asking the question."
46:30;46:31;"- I mean, I think the bigger question"
46:31;46:34;"is what really happened to Jeffrey Epstein and why, you know?"
46:34;46:37;"- Right, even in the most extreme circumstances,"
46:37;46:40;"it's hard to understand why anybody"
46:40;46:42;"would wanna keep him alive."
46:42;46:43;"Like, it just seems easier to kill him."
46:43;46:44;"- I have some theories."
46:44;46:47;"- Actually, you wanna tell, 'cause here's my question."
46:47;46:48;"You know, I've read a little bit."
46:48;46:52;"I don't know as much as you, but there's a lot of people."
46:52;46:53;"Okay, so people have wondered,"
46:53;46:54;"""What's Jeffrey Epstein's deal?"""
46:54;46:58;"Everything from he could be an intelligence asset"
46:58;47:00;"being used by multiple intelligence agencies"
47:00;47:03;"from all around the world, the CIA, Mossad, whatever."
47:03;47:06;"- I think that's 100%, by the way, that he's a spy."
47:06;47:08;"- And even if somebody's a spy,"
47:08;47:10;"it doesn't mean everything they do is spy-esque."
47:10;47:12;"It means that an intelligence agency"
47:12;47:14;"saw how that person could be of value."
47:14;47:15;"- Sure."
47:15;47:16;"- So, you know, maybe he's already running"
47:16;47:17;"the Lolita Express and somebody's like,"
47:17;47:20;"""Ooh, powerful man, up to no good on a plane."
47:20;47:22;"""Let's talk to this guy and see if he can help us,"
47:22;47:24;"""or let's pressure him."""
47:24;47:26;"My feeling is that if you're dealing"
47:26;47:28;"with these hardcore intelligence agencies"
47:28;47:33;"who are doing manipulative, sneaky stuff around the world,"
47:33;47:35;"and you got somebody who's in custody who might talk,"
47:35;47:38;"you know, similar to when mobsters have somebody"
47:38;47:39;"who's gonna testify against them,"
47:39;47:42;"the easiest thing to do would be to have them killed."
47:42;47:43;"So if you're gonna go to the trouble"
47:43;47:45;"of getting somebody into the prison,"
47:45;47:48;"now explain to me why somebody might wanna actually"
47:48;47:51;"go through this extra hassle of keeping somebody alive."
47:51;47:54;"- Well, I mean, A, I think that the island"
47:54;47:56;"that he had set up, it seems to be like"
47:56;47:58;"it was some sort of a honeypot situation"
47:58;47:59;"to where it's like--"
47:59;48:00;"- Get some footage of--"
48:00;48:02;"- Get footage, and he was known for that."
48:02;48:05;"He was known for filming other people"
48:05;48:07;"and their sexual exploits."
48:07;48:09;"He has tapes on a ton of powerful people."
48:09;48:12;"You know, Alexander Acosta, who resigned"
48:12;48:15;"after being the Secretary of Labor--"
48:15;48:15;"- And gave him the sweetheart deal."
48:15;48:17;"- He gave him the sweetheart deal."
48:17;48:20;"In an interview, he said that when they were pressing him,"
48:20;48:22;"saying like, ""Why did you give him this sweetheart deal?"""
48:22;48:24;"He said, ""Basically, I was told"
48:24;48:26;"""that he was above my pay grade,"
48:26;48:28;"""that he was intelligence, and to stay away from him."""
48:28;48:30;"And that's documented."
48:30;48:32;"So who was this guy?"
48:32;48:33;"I don't know."
48:33;48:34;"You know, Mossad, GRU."
48:34;48:35;"- What's GRU?"
48:35;48:37;"- That's like the Russian intelligence."
48:37;48:37;"- Oh, yeah."
48:37;48:39;"- Or did he work for Saudi Arabia?"
48:39;48:41;"I mean, the passport that they found in the safe"
48:41;48:43;"said that he lived in Saudi Arabia."
48:43;48:45;"It was an Austrian passport."
48:45;48:48;"And then the madam, the woman that procured"
48:48;48:50;"all these underage girls and kind of ran things for him,"
48:50;48:53;"his business partner, her father was high up in the Mossad."
48:53;48:54;"- Right, I read about that."
48:54;48:56;"The only thing that I'll say about some of these things"
48:56;48:59;"is that, this is certainly not to refute anything"
48:59;49:01;"that you're saying, and I wonder if you find this too."
49:01;49:04;"Couple indie rock musicians, you know."
49:04;49:04;"We've seen--"
49:04;49:05;"- No, I don't know."
49:05;49:07;"Probably neither of us define--"
49:07;49:08;"- We would be incredible spies, by the way."
49:08;49:10;"I've always thought that there would be like"
49:10;49:11;"a musician shit that would be a great spy"
49:11;49:14;"'cause we're from countries around the world."
49:14;49:15;"- That's true."
49:15;49:16;"- No one would suspect you guys."
49:16;49:17;"- No, everybody's just like,"
49:17;49:19;"""Oh, he's a dumbass musician."
49:19;49:19;"""What are they gonna do?"""
49:19;49:22;"(laughing)"
49:22;49:25;"- The handoff needs to happen at MoPOP in Detroit."
49:25;49:27;"No, but I'm saying, yeah, I don't know if either of us"
49:27;49:29;"identify as indie rock musicians,"
49:29;49:32;"but I would just say, like, we're people who spend time"
49:32;49:35;"in New York, in LA, meet powerful people,"
49:35;49:37;"even just powerful media figures."
49:37;49:38;"- I guess one thing that I've found"
49:38;49:41;"as I've been around more powerful and rich people sometimes"
49:41;49:44;"is that there's a certain mundane aspect to some of this."
49:44;49:46;"So, for instance, this is no way to stick up"
49:46;49:49;"for Jeffrey Epstein or any of his buddies,"
49:49;49:51;"but when I would see a lot of people on the internet"
49:51;49:54;"saying stuff like, ""Yeah, you don't fly on a guy's"
49:54;49:58;"""private plane five times and don't know what he's up to."""
49:58;50:00;"And I was kinda like, ""Actually, you do."""
50:00;50:01;"(laughing)"
50:01;50:04;"Not that I've, I haven't been on very many private planes"
50:04;50:06;"in my life, but when you're around,"
50:06;50:09;"even just like DJs, there's a type of person"
50:09;50:11;"who are just in settings where somebody's like,"
50:11;50:13;"""I'm ripping back to the Hamptons right now on the PJ."
50:13;50:14;"""There's eight seats."""
50:14;50:16;"And somebody would be like, ""Oh, I'll take it."""
50:16;50:18;"So this idea that there's an intimacy,"
50:18;50:20;"to me it's kind of the equivalent of just like,"
50:20;50:21;"you know, somebody would be like,"
50:21;50:24;"""You don't catch a ride five times with like a dude"
50:24;50:27;"""in your grad school program and not know what he's up to."""
50:27;50:30;"Like, there is a way in which these seemingly big deal"
50:30;50:33;"things are just a natural result of these people"
50:33;50:35;"existing in the same kinda social milieu."
50:35;50:38;"- So even I kinda wonder when people were talking about"
50:38;50:40;"if Ghislain Maxwell's father,"
50:40;50:43;"he's known as a Mossad agent or something,"
50:43;50:45;"just the idea that a wealthy guy"
50:45;50:47;"who was a Mossad agent's daughter"
50:47;50:49;"would end up becoming in the inner circle"
50:49;50:50;"of another wealthy guy"
50:50;50:52;"who might have intelligence connections."
50:52;50:54;"The crazy thing is, that could borderline"
50:54;50:57;"still be a coincidence, just because powerful people"
50:57;50:59;"tend to hang out together."
50:59;51:00;"So I'm sure there's all sorts of funny stuff"
51:00;51:02;"where like, somebody's like,"
51:02;51:03;"""Oh, what, you work for the Russians?"
51:03;51:05;"""That's crazy, my dad worked for Saudi Arabia."""
51:05;51:07;"And they're like, ""Wow, and we just met"
51:07;51:09;"""on the rowing team at Harvard, wild."""
51:09;51:12;"And this never came up for 20 years."
51:12;51:15;"So anyway, that's my one caveat with some of this stuff."
51:15;51:16;"The funny thing about a global elite"
51:16;51:18;"is it's gonna create a lot of coincidences"
51:18;51:20;"just because it's the global elite."
51:20;51:21;"- It's a very small group of people."
51:21;51:22;"- It's a small group of people."
51:22;51:25;"But this Saudi Arabia thing is definitely fascinating."
51:25;51:26;"So that's why you--"
51:26;51:28;"- Okay, so no, I mean, back to your original question."
51:28;51:30;"I mean, the only thing that I can think of,"
51:30;51:32;"and obviously it's a stretch,"
51:32;51:34;"but it's interesting to think about is that"
51:34;51:37;"if he was working for a foreign government,"
51:37;51:40;"and if he was collecting this compromat"
51:40;51:44;"or information that's damaging towards our politicians"
51:44;51:47;"or billionaires or whatever, powerful people,"
51:47;51:49;"that they would most likely have a copy of it."
51:49;51:52;"If he was working for a foreign government"
51:52;51:54;"and he was worth something to them,"
51:54;51:55;"if he went into this and he's,"
51:55;51:57;"whatever relationship he has with them,"
51:57;51:59;"if they wanna protect him,"
51:59;52:03;"and they threaten Trump or our government"
52:03;52:06;"with damning material that they'll release"
52:06;52:07;"without the release of Epstein,"
52:07;52:09;"if he had diplomatic immunity"
52:09;52:11;"while he was operating under this,"
52:11;52:13;"which I think that he probably did"
52:13;52:16;"based on the deal that he got from Acosta."
52:16;52:17;"- That maybe the US was like,"
52:17;52:19;"""All right, technically we have to send him back"
52:19;52:22;"""to Saudi Arabia, so we're gonna cook up this whole scheme."""
52:22;52:23;"- I don't know, I mean, I don't know."
52:23;52:25;"I just wouldn't put it past."
52:25;52:27;"Why would that be harder for them"
52:27;52:31;"to swap him out with somebody that looks somewhat like him"
52:31;52:33;"or to try to doctor somebody that'll look like him"
52:33;52:35;"and swap him out in the middle of the night"
52:35;52:38;"when they basically told the guards to back off,"
52:38;52:39;"they stopped monitoring his cell,"
52:39;52:41;"they moved his cellmate out, they cleared it all out?"
52:41;52:43;"It's the US government."
52:43;52:45;"They could walk in there, swap him out, trade him back."
52:45;52:48;"- Well, that seems easier to do than 9/11."
52:48;52:50;"Before you came in, I was also,"
52:50;52:54;"we were also talking about 9/11 conspiracies, which again--"
52:54;52:55;"- It ain't hard."
52:55;52:57;"- 'Cause that's the thing also,"
52:57;52:59;"when I've talked to people who feel very strongly"
52:59;53:00;"about 9/11 being an inside job,"
53:00;53:02;"and as I was saying before, you came here,"
53:02;53:04;"I'm a very live and let live, open-minded kind of guy."
53:04;53:07;"I'm like, ""Hey man, I don't believe everything"
53:07;53:08;"""the New York Times says."""
53:08;53:10;"Like, sure, tell me why you think that is."
53:10;53:12;"But one thing about that is always like,"
53:12;53:15;"""Well, if that in fact was an inside job,"
53:15;53:16;"""I'm glad they didn't ask me to help"
53:16;53:18;"""'cause that sounds like a lot of work."
53:18;53:20;"""That sounds very, very complicated."""
53:20;53:22;"Where you're right, compared to that,"
53:22;53:24;"'cause maybe you could do that with five people,"
53:24;53:27;"I don't know, I believe that."
53:27;53:30;"I believe you could swap a body and get a guy on a,"
53:30;53:30;"I mean, if you're talking about somebody that has--"
53:30;53:32;"- On a PJ to Saudi Arabia?"
53:32;53:34;"- If you're talking about somebody that has information"
53:34;53:37;"that's going to bring down your entire government,"
53:37;53:39;"you know, from the top down,"
53:39;53:40;"they're not gonna stop at anything."
53:40;53:42;"- That's one question that I have is 'cause,"
53:42;53:43;"and I know this is not what you're gesturing at,"
53:43;53:46;"but within the world of conspiracy theorists,"
53:46;53:47;"there's kind of like a spectrum."
53:47;53:49;"There's people, obviously on one end of the spectrum,"
53:49;53:51;"you have people who are not conspiracy theorists who say,"
53:51;53:54;"""I believe what the mainstream media says, it's the truth."""
53:54;53:56;"And then on the other side, the most extreme side,"
53:56;53:59;"you have people who say, ""Not only is that not the truth,"
53:59;54:01;"""the very nature of reality that you understand"
54:01;54:04;"""is not the truth, and that these guys are hiding"
54:04;54:07;"""big secrets about the way the entire universe"
54:07;54:09;"""is structured,"" and that seems a little bit extreme too."
54:09;54:12;"And, you know, what you're saying is something in between"
54:12;54:14;"about the way the intelligence community"
54:14;54:16;"gathers information and blackmails."
54:16;54:18;"You're like, ""Sure, I believe that there's all sorts"
54:18;54:19;"""of stuff that we don't know about"
54:19;54:20;"""that exists in that world."""
54:20;54:22;"I guess one question that I have,"
54:22;54:23;"and again, I also wanna make the point"
54:23;54:25;"that it's very cool of you to come on the show"
54:25;54:27;"because your whole thing that you said"
54:27;54:29;"when I actually read all of the tweets,"
54:29;54:30;"when you said do your own research,"
54:30;54:32;"you weren't actually encouraging Foster the People fans"
54:32;54:33;"to fly to Saudi Arabia."
54:33;54:36;"This is your chance to clarify that, right?"
54:36;54:37;"- That's not-- - Right."
54:37;54:38;"You were kinda just saying--"
54:38;54:40;"- It was more of a broad statement of like, you know,"
54:40;54:43;"you need to read information and not just watch television"
54:43;54:44;"for your news."
54:44;54:46;"- Right, and also your point about like,"
54:46;54:47;"yeah, I'm an artist-- - Or get your news"
54:47;54:48;"from memes. - But I'm also an artist"
54:48;54:51;"and I'm just a person who kinda is just talking about stuff."
54:51;54:54;"Like, yeah, so when I saw the whole context of it,"
54:54;54:56;"you're definitely not trying to like say,"
54:56;54:58;"""Guys, I'm an expert on this and I know what happened."""
54:58;55:01;"So I feel bad now peppering you with the questions,"
55:01;55:02;"just kinda like, ""Well, tell me about this."""
55:02;55:03;"But I just, so I just wanna make clear,"
55:03;55:04;"we're just talking about it."

56:14;56:17;"and I could believe anything, man, almost anything,"
56:17;56:20;"but why, so what you're saying makes sense."
56:20;56:23;"Like, sure, there's a plausible explanation"
56:23;56:27;"for why it might be important to get that guy out of there,"
56:27;56:29;"and he's a foreign intelligence asset,"
56:29;56:32;"and the US has a diplomatic community."
56:32;56:33;"I can believe that."
56:33;56:34;"But there's also a part of me, it's like,"
56:34;56:36;"why does the global elite care so much"
56:36;56:38;"about these three knuckleheads?"
56:38;56:40;"Bill Clinton's basically on his last legs"
56:40;56:41;"in terms of public standing."
56:41;56:44;"Trump kind of seems like more trouble than he's worth."
56:44;56:47;"Prince Andrew, not even Prince Charles, like, who?"
56:47;56:48;"There's like a part of me that's like,"
56:48;56:50;"okay, let's say there are like nine kind of powerful dudes."
56:50;56:52;"The global elite could keep on truck"
56:52;56:53;"and could be like, oh my God."
56:53;56:56;"- I mean, if we're talking in that universe"
56:56;56:59;"of the global elite making the call for this to happen,"
56:59;57:01;"I don't really think the global elite"
57:01;57:02;"would have made the call for this to happen,"
57:02;57:03;"'cause I don't think they would care"
57:03;57:04;"about something like that."
57:04;57:06;"I think that it would be Donald Trump,"
57:06;57:11;"basically our government, protecting their own asses."
57:11;57:13;"- In some ways, specifically protecting Trump."
57:13;57:15;"- The Clintons don't have, they don't have the power."
57:15;57:16;"There's no way the Clintons could be behind,"
57:16;57:19;"that was like the one thing when all the fallout,"
57:19;57:21;"all that stuff, it's like, okay,"
57:21;57:23;"like they're out of power."
57:23;57:25;"They couldn't pull this off if they wanted to,"
57:25;57:27;"but our current government could."
57:27;57:28;"And especially if you look at, you know,"
57:28;57:32;"Attorney General Bill Barr, and you look at Acosta,"
57:32;57:34;"two guys that were closely related to Epstein"
57:34;57:37;"and protecting Epstein, Barr was,"
57:37;57:38;"he worked for the attorney's office"
57:38;57:41;"that represented Epstein in the sweetheart deal."
57:41;57:44;"Acosta was the lawyer that gave him the deal."
57:44;57:47;"And both those guys were then promoted heavily"
57:47;57:50;"by Donald Trump, who's keeping those people close to him"
57:50;57:52;"that helped protect this guy"
57:52;57:54;"that might have some dark secrets on him."
57:54;57:55;"- Maybe that's been my question,"
57:55;57:59;"is because you know with spicy topics like this,"
57:59;58:01;"you'll see such a range of opinion,"
58:01;58:03;"and you'll see people taking it into like,"
58:03;58:04;"well, you gotta understand, this is like"
58:04;58:06;"the whole fate of the world hinges on this,"
58:06;58:08;"and you're kind of saying, no, maybe it's actually,"
58:08;58:09;"it's as simple as-- - It's more like"
58:09;58:10;"a mafia thing. - Yeah, it's as simple"
58:10;58:13;"as one guy trying to protect his ass and using,"
58:13;58:14;"and the intelligence community's being like,"
58:14;58:17;"eh, we don't wanna really release details"
58:17;58:18;"about how we do stuff."
58:18;58:20;"Yeah, like maybe it's actually not,"
58:20;58:21;"there's something about the word conspiracy theory"
58:21;58:23;"that sometimes makes people think of like,"
58:23;58:26;"you know, reptilians and like, aliens and stuff."
58:26;58:27;"It could be as simple as just like a few people"
58:27;58:29;"being like, whoa, let's see--"
58:29;58:31;"- There's probably only a handful of people"
58:31;58:32;"that know what happened."
58:32;58:34;"I don't think that there's hundreds of people involved,"
58:34;58:36;"that there's some order, it's like, you can't keep a secret,"
58:36;58:38;"you know, it's like, but you can keep a secret"
58:38;58:39;"with five people."
58:39;58:41;"- The darkest thing of all that I was saying is,"
58:41;58:43;"and I wonder what you think about this,"
58:43;58:45;"my feeling is that there's almost no way"
58:45;58:47;"that this is a bad thing for Trump."
58:47;58:49;"The fact that the Clinton name"
58:49;58:51;"is even remotely associated with this,"
58:51;58:54;"because Trump is the epitome of shamelessness,"
58:54;58:56;"he's the 0.1% of bacteria that don't get killed"
58:56;59:01;"by bacterial sites, because he clearly is the Teflon Don,"
59:01;59:05;"and his fans and supporters will turn anything"
59:05;59:08;"into a win for him, and then you see him, you know,"
59:08;59:09;"retweeting the Clinton body count stuff."
59:09;59:11;"There's a part of me that's like,"
59:11;59:13;"there could be all sorts of stuff that comes out"
59:13;59:16;"in the next few months, and I still have this weird feeling"
59:16;59:18;"that it's gonna be a win for him."
59:18;59:22;"- Another reason why I think he's so desperate to protect,"
59:22;59:24;"you know, now he's campaigning for the next election already"
59:24;59:27;"and he's so desperate to protect his name and to win again,"
59:27;59:29;"because he knows that if he wins again,"
59:29;59:31;"he can hide behind executive privilege,"
59:31;59:33;"he's protected for another four years from going to jail."
59:33;59:35;"- And all sorts of other lawsuits."
59:35;59:36;"- All sorts of everything, you know,"
59:36;59:39;"he's skirted around pretty much any kind of law,"
59:39;59:40;"there's no rule of law right now."
59:40;59:41;"- Yeah."
59:41;59:44;"- So I mean, when it's applied to President Trump"
59:44;59:45;"and anybody that's around him,"
59:45;59:46;"he's made that clear."
59:46;59:48;"So I think like his number one fear right now"
59:48;59:50;"is that he's gonna get unseated"
59:50;59:52;"and that he's gonna have to like go to court"
59:52;59:55;"in the state of New York and at a federal level,"
59:55;59:58;"all these open, you know, cases against him"
59:58;01:00:00;"are gonna come to fruition and he's gonna,"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"who knows what'll happen."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"- Well, shifting gears to the message of hope,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"you still, you still,"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"you think there's anybody who could beat him?"
01:00:07;01:00:08;"You still like Bernie?"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"- I think that every Democrat running right now"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"has a chance to beat him."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"- Yeah, I agree with that, they all have a chance."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"- I think it's gonna be interesting."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"- I think it's the Dems to lose,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"which could easily happen."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"- I just hope it's not Biden."
01:00:22;01:00:22;"- I know."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"- Biden's kind of the easiest one to see losing in a way."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Yeah."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"- Having just some major brain fart on stage"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"during those debates."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Yeah, it's not looking good."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"He seemed to think that he was the vice president"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"during the Parkland shooting recently."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"- Yeah, some basic cognitive problems."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- Not a strong look."

01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Mark, while you're here,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"you have come up on the show before."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"We normally don't cover too much kind of politics."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"We haven't covered Jeffrey Epstein too much,"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"but we have covered Imagine Dragons quite a bit."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- Okay."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- And when the guy from Imagine Dragons,"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Dan, wrote his thing about, you know,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"how it bums him out that everybody's picking on him,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"we covered that and we talked about that."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"- Right."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"- And we were very happy to see that"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"of all the people he talked about"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"who kind of hurt his feelings,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"you were the only person who apologized."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"So we gave you a lot of props for that."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"So you're welcome."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- Oh wait."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- We gave you a lot of props."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Oh, thank you."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- No, but I really thought,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"and you know, it's like,"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- Very kind."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- And we were just talking about it recently"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"because as opposed to you kind of like taking a step back"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"and being like, ""Damn, maybe I said something"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"""that hurt somebody that wasn't cool."""
01:02:29;01:02:32;"And you apologized unreservedly."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"One of the guys from the 1975,"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"he went the other direction."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"He was just like, ""Man, why do you care?"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"""Shut the, like,"" he was kind of like,"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"whatever, but whatever, that's a whole nother story."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Anyway, so I just wanted to say,"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"I thought that was cool of you."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"I'm curious, like, you and that guy from Madden Dragons"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"know each other at all,"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"or this was all just happening fully"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"across the universe of the internet?"
01:02:49;01:02:53;"- We've definitely met like in passing early, early, early on"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"I think like the third Foster the People show ever,"
01:02:55;01:02:58;"they were on the bills at the Viper Room."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"- Yeah."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"- But I mean, the whole band had changed."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Like when they emerged like three years later,"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"you know, that's like when we were all kind of just like,"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"you know, small, tiny bands just starting out."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"But no, I don't really know."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"I don't really know him."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"It was a passing comment, but it was more--"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"- Whatever you said, I don't think was particularly mean."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"- No, but I mean, it was more about his reaction"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"and kind of like realizing like, oh, okay."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"I don't want to disparage anybody else for their art,"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"and I just feel like it was just kind of like,"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"just take the high road and support somebody"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"who obviously wants to do good things for his community,"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"you know, and like separate myself"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"from the music itself."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"It's like the guy's a good guy."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"I think that sometimes, you know,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"like a battle in music, whether it's hip hop"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"or rock or whatever,"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"if both parties kind of understand what's going on,"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"then they can kind of turn it into a game,"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"and then it becomes some sort of entertainment,"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"kind of like this weird meta form of entertainment"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"where it's like they both know the game they're playing,"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"and they both go back and forth,"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"and the press kind of like--"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"- Pro-wrestling."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"- I mean, look at Oasis."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Look at Liam and Noel."
01:04:00;01:04:00;"- Right."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"- Like they play off each other brilliantly in the press,"
01:04:03;01:04:06;"and they've kept Oasis completely relevant"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"for the last like 20 years."
01:04:08;01:04:08;"- Right."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"- And like the second Oasis announced the tour"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"and they get back together,"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"it's gonna make an astronomical amount of money."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"- Oh, it'll be huge."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"- Because people are gonna be like,"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"""Wow, the two brothers, they're together again on stage."
01:04:19;01:04:19;"""Can you believe it?"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"""They're not fist fighting."""
01:04:20;01:04:21;"And then the ticket sales go down,"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"they'll like, you know, they'll get into some kind"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"of fist fight. - It's a way better narrative"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"than just like--"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"- It's real life."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"It's Jerry Springer."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- Things cooled off."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"Fifth album wasn't received as well as the first three,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"and you know, they got into some different stuff."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"Noel really got into golf, and yeah, they talk all the time."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"They love to do a few gigs."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"You know, it just depends on schedule."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"It's like, yeah, versus like,"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"""Holy (beep) I never thought I'd see those two guys"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"""on stage together again."""
01:04:45;01:04:46;"- Right."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- Yeah, it's way better."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- Way better, way better."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"But yeah, I mean, it was so, you know, look,"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"you know, when he came out and said that,"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"it was so genuine, and it really like,"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"really struck me, and we're just like, oh man."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- Right, so you didn't feel defensive."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"You were just immediately like, oh man."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"I'm sure you probably didn't even remember"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"whatever you said."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"It's not like this was a campaign you waged against them."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"- No, no, and it's just, I don't know."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"It's just kind of (beep)"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"It's like, we're all artists making music."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"I feel like music's supposed to be unifying."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Art is subjective anyway."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"It's like, who am I to like,"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"disparage somebody else for something they,"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"obviously a lot of other people like it."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- Yeah. - You know?"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"I don't need to be that guy."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"- I think just anybody who like, makes music,"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"or thinks deeply about music,"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"there's all sorts of music that maybe, you know,"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"I didn't like when I was 12,"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"and then I liked it when I was 17,"
01:05:30;01:05:31;"and then I didn't like it again,"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"and now I think it's actually really interesting."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"So there's even that aspect too,"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"that it's like a throwaway comment"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"about how you feel about music in a moment."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Yeah, you might have meant it then."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"I don't like this, but then, yeah, who knows?"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"In a different context, or getting to know somebody,"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"you hear it totally differently too, so."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"- Totally, yeah."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"- Well, Mark, thanks so much for coming in."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"And actually, just to kind of reiterate,"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"the main focus of your tweets,"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"which was not necessarily which narrative is correct,"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"but what do you want to say to the people,"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"like the general,"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"'cause I liked your general statement"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"about thinking for yourself, you know?"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- I guess I would say that I feel like we're, you know,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"we're living in an age of misinformation."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"People need to do their own research and dig,"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"and not believe everything that you hear."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- And another thing, I'm a little bit of a pessimist"
01:06:14;01:06:19;"in that I feel like with a lot of these cover-ups"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"and, you know, misinformation campaigns,"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"I'm a pessimist in the sense that I'm sympathetic"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"to a lot of different theories,"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"or at least I'm open to them,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"but I have this kind of feeling like,"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"oh, we're never gonna know."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"- We're never gonna know."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"- Yeah, like we're never gonna know."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"So I think in some ways--"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"- 100% agree, we're never gonna know."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"- So again, when I actually saw your tweets in context,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"and I thought like, okay, did Jeffrey Epstein"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"go get John Travolta's face put on him in Saudi Arabia?"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"We're never going to know."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"We will never know the real story."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"So what you said on Twitter,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"let's say that story's 100% accurate."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"You'll never be proven right,"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"because we will never know that."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"- You'll only know if I drive off of a bridge"
01:06:56;01:07:01;"that was considered to be, if I die from natural causes."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Well, yeah, and even then."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Well, we'll fight, we'll keep your memory alive"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"and fight for the truth on TC,"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"but yeah, even then you'll never know."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"So I think the interesting point that you're making"
01:07:10;01:07:14;"is like a healthy distrust of information,"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"maybe no falsehood people are gonna go to Saudi Arabia"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"and crack the case on that one,"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"but I think the real point you're making is,"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"okay, this is clearly very shady."
01:07:24;01:07:27;"So maybe next time you can make a decision,"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"you can make a decision,"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"like choosing who you're gonna vote for,"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"or watch the way that the different Democrats"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"talk to each other, and one person says,"
01:07:34;01:07:35;"""I think this is a big problem."""
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Somebody says, ""Oh, man, we don't have time"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"""to worry about that,"" or that's bull (beep)."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"I do think that there's a kind of mindset."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"You can't take the truth away from this."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"I don't think that's gonna happen,"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"but you could take a mindset away"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"that can hopefully be applied for good."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"- Well, I think it's just also just pay attention"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"to the larger picture of kind of what's happening"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"with the media, with stories getting spun,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"and with the way that people are getting manipulated"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"one way or the next based on whatever narrative"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"people wanna put out there. - Well, there was just"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"another one this week, a much smaller story."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"I don't know if you saw this, that Bernie Sanders,"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"we were talking about how conspiracy in plain sight"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"is kind of how Amazon doesn't pay taxes."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"And again, let's give Jeff Bezos a break for a second."
01:08:16;01:08:19;"Let's just say that's (beep) up that that company does that."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And so Bernie was doing press,"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"and he rails against Amazon,"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"says, ""I don't like the way they operate."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"""I don't like the fact that they didn't pay a nickel"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"""in taxes."""
01:08:30;01:08:32;"And then he said, ""And you know, by the way,"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"""the Washington Post owned by Jeff Bezos,"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"""maybe that's why they don't like me."""
01:08:37;01:08:38;"And the truth is,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"the Washington Post has gone pretty hard on Bernie."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"It's not like he's pulling that out of nowhere."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"But then what was interesting is that I saw a lot"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"of Bernie supporters being like, ""Thank you."""
01:08:45;01:08:47;"And then I saw a lot, a lot of other people being like,"

01:08:50;01:08:53;"""Trump-esque conspiracy theories, like chill out, man."""
01:08:53;01:08:54;"And I was kind of like shocked."
01:08:54;01:08:57;"I was like, ""Look, again, you don't need to,"
01:08:57;01:09:00;"""whether he's in Saudi Arabia, dead, or killed himself,"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"""whatever you think, there's something fishy"

01:09:03;01:09:04;"""You just think a few days after that,"

01:09:14;01:09:15;"""but you're absolutely right"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"""that billionaires owning the press"

01:09:23;01:09:24;"""for everybody else."""
01:09:24;01:09:26;"But it was amazing how many people got angry"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"at Bernie for saying that."
01:09:27;01:09:27;"- Of course."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"I looked it up before I came in here."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- Oh, really?"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"- I was just curious who ran basically mass media"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"around the world."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"And it comes down to about, I think it's 15 guys"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"that own-- - Own all these mega companies."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"- The mega companies and conglomerates,"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"where they all, how they all spider web out"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"of kind of the main brain of the company."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"15 people, you know?"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"So they can control the narrative basically"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"for the news around the entire world."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"And the thing about, I guess that rattled me"
01:09:57;01:10:01;"about this Epstein story was that it reminded me"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"of the Steven Paddock shooting in Vegas."
01:10:05;01:10:10;"Because that whole thing, I'm convinced, was a coverup."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"And I was haunted by it for months."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"- Oh, so you feel like the people just never knew"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"the true story?"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- We never, no, we never got the story."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- And just to clarify, this is the guy who set up"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"at a hotel and shot up the country music festival."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"- Right. - Yeah, right."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- Yeah, we never got the story."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"And there were all these eyewitness accounts"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"of people saying that the FBI came in, took their phones,"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"and cleared their phones of any videos of the shooting."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"I mean, there was 25 different facts about that."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"We don't have time."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"This isn't really the place to get into it."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"But I'm convinced that that was a coverup."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"And the thing about the way that the media works,"
01:10:40;01:10:44;"and that's what's scary to me with this Epstein thing"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"is that, I mean, there were two mass shootings"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"that happened earlier this week."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"Nobody's talking about that anymore."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"You know, there's kids in cages."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Nobody's talking about that anymore."
01:10:52;01:10:56;"The media can take people's attention, like Plato,"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"and point it whatever direction they want,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"and get it away from the thing that they actually want"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"to continue to get away with."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"The PADDOC thing was scary because after a week,"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"nobody covered it anymore."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"There was no investigative journalism."
01:11:09;01:11:12;"- Yeah, people don't have the bandwidth,"
01:11:12;01:11:13;"and part of that is just the fact that--"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"- Five years ago, we would've known everything"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"about that guy."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- Right, well, even people live on the internet,"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"it really does turn all of our brains to mush a little bit."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Sometimes when you're like half asleep,"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"like scrolling through your phone,"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"you just realize like, oh wow,"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"like my comprehension skills aren't as good."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"It's like there's unprecedented access to information,"
01:11:30;01:11:35;"but clearly we're all becoming a little bit brain damaged."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"Yeah, and you think about things that happened in the past."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"You know, think about like the Unabomber."
01:11:39;01:11:43;"He killed, I think, three people, four people,"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"and he was a point of focus for like a decade."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"I mean, to be fair, I guess that,"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"maybe that's a bad example"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"'cause he was at large for a decade,"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"but there were individual shootings and events"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"that took place that clearly would be talked about"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"for months and months, and it's, yeah, it's overload."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"I don't know if that's,"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"that might just be the nature of the technology"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"that disseminates information,"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"but yeah, I know what you mean."
01:12:05;01:12:09;"It's like, it's not hard to imagine the time"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"when the Epstein story will be supplanted by something else."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"Yeah, unless things continue to get uncovered,"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"like, you know, there was a 12-man SWAT team"
01:12:18;01:12:21;"that raided his island yesterday."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Oh yeah, I saw some drone footage of that."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Did you see the drone footage?"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Like some random dude just like sent a drone over there?"
01:12:26;01:12:27;"No, no, really?"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"Yeah, I don't know if there's any."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"Well, anyway, thanks so much for coming in."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Hope you'll come back."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"Thanks for having me."

01:14:39;01:14:40;"Whoa."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"I think Starlight Walker was 94,"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"and I was a huge Pavement head,"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"so he came from that universe."
01:14:47;01:14:48;"Yeah."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"He was like a college buddy with the Pavement dudes."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Seen him live?"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"Saw him live once, not good."
01:14:54;01:14:55;"Yeah?"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"He was a poet and a songwriter."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"Was he--"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Not a rock star."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Was he like the Robert Hunter"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"to Pavement's Grateful Dead?"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"That's an interesting analogy."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"I mean, you could see a similarity"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"between the Pavement lyrical aesthetic"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"and the Silver Jues one."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"They made music together too."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"Yeah, Malcolms was on the,"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"well, he was on a few of the Silver Jues records."

01:15:20;01:15:23;"and I was, and you know, it sounded familiar."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"I see here that the last song"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"that the Silver Jues performed live"
01:15:26;01:15:27;"was Smith and Jones' Forever."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"I played that one, and I was like,"

01:24:45;01:24:46;"- No, it's about time."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"- It's time."

01:24:50;01:24:52;"It's about time to get into the top five."

01:24:57;01:25:02;"- This week, we're comparing the top five hits of today"
01:25:02;01:25:05;"on the iTunes store, the shortest time to play"

01:25:08;01:25:10;"with the top five songs of 1999."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Why 1999?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"- A few reasons."
01:25:13;01:25:13;"- Yeah."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"- This is episode 99."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"- You're kidding."
01:25:16;01:25:16;"- That we're recording right now."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"- That was one of the questions from the TC Wiki"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"was you have anything special planned for episode 100?"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"- Well, we're coming up on it."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- Yeah, we gotta figure something out."
01:25:24;01:25:28;"- And I graduated college in 99."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"- Wow."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"- And it's 20 years ago."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"- 99 was kind of a big year for me."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- Oh, or maybe 98."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- You were still in high school?"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"- My freshman year was 98 to 99."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Yeah, 99 was like,"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"I do think those are like interesting stages."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"When you first get to middle school,"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"when you first get to high school,"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"when you first get to college,"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"those kind of feel like moving up"
01:25:47;01:25:50;"into degrees of consciousness."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"And then after college, it's all just kind of like a,"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"melts into one endless nightmare."
01:25:55;01:25:59;"But I have actually very vivid memories of the summer of 98."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Spent a lot of time at my friend's house"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"and I think TRL was new."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"So we were watching Total Request Live"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"and I felt like from ages 10 to 13,"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"I was kind of just like taking it all in,"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"figuring shit out and then I was like,"
01:26:11;01:26:15;"okay, 98, summer 98, next year I'm entering high school."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"What's going on?"
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Britney Spears."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- Eminem."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- Eminem, fastball."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"It really did kind of felt like me entering high school"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"also was just like this new era of pop culture too."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"But maybe that's how you always feel."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"It's like you turn 14 and you're just kind of like,"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"okay, like what's up with the world?"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"- Yeah, 'cause when you say that,"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"those are not big cultural moments, fastball and--"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"- No, okay, yeah, I was kidding about fastball."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"- No, I know, but even Britney Spears."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"- No, no, Britney Spears and Eminem looking back,"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"that was--"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"- Okay, sure."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"- That changed the world."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Rap rock."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Well, I wouldn't say that."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- And then rap rock."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"So I remember like 98 to 2000,"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"I was very familiar with that time period"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"and I was like, this is weird."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"- Were you into that stuff?"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"- No, because I was already like a little hipster."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"- Right."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- So for instance-- - Thank God, dude."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"- Well, I definitely wasn't on some like,"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Britney Spears sucks."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"- No, no, I'm talking, I'm not talking about Britney,"
01:27:03;01:27:06;"I'm talking about Limp Bizkit and Slipknot."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"- I made the best of it."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"Well, basically, I've always been kind of a straight shooter."
01:27:12;01:27:17;"The period where I was the biggest hater was like sixth grade"
01:27:17;01:27:21;"because, you know, I was 12, I was still a child."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"In the Jewish faith, you'd become a man at 13"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"when you're bar mitzvahed."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"But when I was 12, I still was a child,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"I hadn't put away childish things."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"I still had this kind of like chip on my shoulder"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"about like, I'm into cool music"
01:27:33;01:27:36;"and I don't know what music you guys like, but it sucks."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"So for instance, there's a punk band from New Jersey"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"called The Bouncing Souls."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Are you familiar with them, Jake?"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"- No."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"- That's fair, that's a Jake not knowing something,"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"that's fair."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"But Bouncing Souls are, I think they're still a band,"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"a great band."
01:27:48;01:27:50;"They had like one or two albums"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"that I just like thought were great."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"One of them is called Maniacal Laughter."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"And so I just loved Bouncing Souls."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"I love that they're from New Jersey."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"I feel like they wore sambas a lot."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I don't know if they like played soccer,"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"but like wearing sambas, Adidas sambas"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"as part of their aesthetic."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"And I was just like, the songs are great."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"I love this band."
01:28:07;01:28:10;"And I bought a t-shirt from some mail order catalog."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"It was a Bouncing Souls t-shirt that on the back"
01:28:12;01:28:16;"said MTV in like the anti circle."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Right, right, right."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"- Like MTV crossed out."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"- Like the Ghostbusters logo."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"- Yeah, anti MTV."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"So some part of me, you know, I was like 12."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"So I was just kind of like, well, I like Bouncing Souls"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"and they're clearly anti MTV."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"And I guess it makes sense"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"because they're an independent samba wearing"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"New Jersey punk band."
01:28:31;01:28:32;"These are my people."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"They speak for me and they don't like MTV."
01:28:34;01:28:37;"And also as discussed on the program, I didn't have MTV."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"So I didn't feel like super loyal to it."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"- I thought you were gonna go the other way."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"I thought you were gonna say, now hold on here."
01:28:42;01:28:46;"A band is part music and part image."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- Right."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"- And a band embracing having their image on TV"
01:28:50;01:28:53;"is not antithetical to the authenticity of their music."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"- No, I wasn't there yet man."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"- I'm out with the Bouncing Souls now."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"- No, no, no."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"- That's not how it went."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"- I would never be out with the Bouncing Souls."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"But like I said, I was 12."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"So I just kind of like went along with it."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"And I think it made me feel good to be like,"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"oh, kids in my school, they learn about music from MTV,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"but they don't even know about Bouncing Souls."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"And here I am wearing a t-shirt that shows my solidarity"
01:29:12;01:29:16;"with the Bouncing Souls and shows that I don't like MTV."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"- You're legit."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"- And you know, again, in my small town,"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"it didn't really like mean much."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"So I do remember somebody I was friendly with"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"just being like, hey, what's up with that shirt?"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"What's wrong with MTV?"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"And I just remember kind of like thinking about it."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"And I was like, and I felt like myself about to say"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"whatever like super-"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"- Talking point."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"- Talking point to like, well, MTV,"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"they only play garbage and blah, blah, blah."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"And I just remember, I kind of just like,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"it was like almost the moment that I like shifted"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"into the person I am today."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And I was just kind of like, I don't know."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"These guys don't like MTV."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"You're right, there's some good stuff on MTV."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"I didn't really have it in me."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"- That's when Vampire Weekend started."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"- And that's when Vampire Weekend started."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"- Wow."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"- Which is equal parts Bouncing Souls"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"and equal parts mid nineties MTV."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"And I think the truth is, of course,"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"there's a lot of things wrong with MTV."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"At the time you could be like,"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"they're ignoring things that deserve it and blah, blah, blah."
01:30:04;01:30:07;"But when I really look back as an adult"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"and I'm thinking about the fact that they like,"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"well, this isn't about music,"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"but the fact that they put on like Beavis and Butthead"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"and Daria and like, you know,"
01:30:14;01:30:17;"showed the world Nirvana videos"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"and helped popularize rap to like kids"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"who probably only listen to rock and like,"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"and you know, they played a lot of good videos."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"I'm kind of like, I can't be that mad at it."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Like there's way worse things, but you know."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"- Yeah, looking back at nineties MTV is like a utopian,"
01:30:31;01:30:35;"like college station practically."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"- Right, and it got a lot worse, but you know."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"- No, no, no, that's terrible."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"- And I still respect the Bouncing Souls"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"for feeling that way."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"I just felt myself like about to say something"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"that I didn't really like know if I felt."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"- Right."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"- And I was like, yeah, I'm a poser because even though"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"I'm not, I wasn't a big enough poser to wear a shirt"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"from a band that I didn't listen to."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"- Right."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"- So I have so much self-respect for that,"
01:30:55;01:30:58;"but I was a poser in that I was about to just like,"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"and you know what, I'd like to think"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"that the Bouncing Souls would have been proud of me"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"for checking myself and not just regurgitating"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"their talking points 'cause they're open-minded"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"punk rock band."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"So anyway, that's all to say that age 12, sixth grade,"
01:31:10;01:31:13;"that was my peak kind of contrarianism."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"And then in seventh grade, I became kind of just like"
01:31:15;01:31:20;"full music nerd 'cause I remember I got some gift"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"certificates for my bar mitzvah."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"It's easy to remember."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"I guess it's easy to remember when you're Jewish,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"like your 13th birthday is such a big deal"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"'cause you do have to learn all this stuff."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"So I remember like I went to Tower Records in the city"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"with like a family friend and I got to buy all this,"
01:31:32;01:31:35;"and that's when I was like obsessed with like ska"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"and reggae, new stuff in from the 60s,"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"and like I started getting into garage rock"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"and I got this compilation called ""Back From The Crypt"
01:31:42;01:31:45;"Volume 2,"" very influential in my life."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"So anyway, that's when I just became like a music nerd"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"and then next summer, you know, now I'm 14"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"and seeing Britney Spears, and by that point,"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I was just like listening to too much music"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"to have like strong feelings about anything."
01:31:55;01:31:58;"So I was kind of like Britney Spears, okay."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Definitely didn't make me angry."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"I was kind of like, this is weird."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- Kind of catchy."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"- Kind of catchy."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"And then when all the new metal stuff hit,"
01:32:05;01:32:10;"I was kind of like, huh, Limp Bizkit, like this is weird,"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"but I kind of like the song that DJ,"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"I like the hip hop side of it."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Like there's a song DJ Premier produced,"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"and I always liked ""System of a Down."""
01:32:18;01:32:20;"So that's what I mean, like I made the best of it."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"I was like, you know, when that stuff was playing everywhere"
01:32:22;01:32:26;"I'd be like, okay, I'm not fully down with Limp Bizkit"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"and I don't think they're a great band,"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"but this is my favorite of their songs."
01:32:29;01:32:32;"And I do think the best band of this genre"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"is ""System of a Down."""
01:32:34;01:32:35;"I just didn't have like this kind of like,"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"oh, this (beep) sucks."
01:32:37;01:32:40;"- You know, I was older, I was like, this (beep) sucks."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"And I was right."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"- Except for ""System."""
01:32:42;01:32:43;"- Yeah, ""System,"" I was like, okay, well,"
01:32:43;01:32:46;"this is like mathy and like kind of proggy."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"- And also I always loved ""Rage Against the Machine"" too."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:32:49;01:32:50;"- But so when that music hit."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"- But ""Rage"" is like 93 or four."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"- No, no, of course, they were the godfathers."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"But when that music hit, I saw how these were people"
01:32:56;01:33:00;"who liked ""Rage"" and I couldn't fully hate on it."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"- That first ""Rage"" record, dude."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"- And the second one."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"Actually, ""Rage"" never made a bad album."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"- ""Audioslave."""

01:35:24;01:35:27;"- I think it's adjacent to Silicon Valley"
01:35:27;01:35:31;"and like 45 miles from San Francisco."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"- It's really not close to San Fran."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"- It's probably 45 miles."
01:35:35;01:35:38;"- Yeah, with traffic, it's like an hour and a half."
01:35:38;01:35:39;"- Yeah, okay."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"Talk a little Bay Area."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"You got that 101 corridor through Redwood City."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"- Yeah, you spend much time in San Jose"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"when you used to live up there?"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"- No, I mean--"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- You mean you've never been to the Winchester Mystery House?"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"- No, I never have."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"- Well, I have."
01:35:53;01:35:53;"- Have you?"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"- And it's very spooky."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"- I'm not ripping in San Jose."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"I'm saying for a city of that size"
01:35:59;01:36:00;"in that part of the world--"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"- This guy's ripping on San Jose."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"- Northern California, it's a bit of a ghost, man."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"I'm just wondering how Smash Mouth"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"got their career going out of San Jose."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"I'm just intrigued by those mechanics."
01:36:10;01:36:14;"- I think it's the same as in any major metropolitan area."
01:36:14;01:36:17;"They're not from a one stoplight town in West Texas."
01:36:17;01:36:21;"San Jose, you're talking about a thriving metropolitan area."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"I'm sure there are many clubs, organizations,"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"places for them to play."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"- Organizations."
01:36:26;01:36:30;"- And yeah, I bet they probably ripped up to the Bay."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"Well, I guess they are the Bay."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"- North Bay."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"- They ripped up to San Fran."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Do you think Smash Mouth ever played at,"
01:36:36;01:36:37;"what's the punk club in--"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"- Oh, Gilman?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"- Gilman."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"- Are you from Berkeley?"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"That's actually a good question."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"- Early Smash Mouth gigs."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- I bet they did."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"- You also gotta assume bands like Smash Mouth,"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"when they came out, 'cause their first set was,"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"you might as well be walking on the sun."
01:36:50;01:36:55;"They were like a little more Hawaiian shirts, rockabilly."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"- Yeah, they seem very SoCal."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Very Orange County."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"- But guys like that always have roots in punk rock."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"You don't turn into a Hawaiian shirt guy"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"unless you start with punk rock."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"- It's so true, dude."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"I went through that transition from sixth to seventh grade."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Exotica, you know, you're familiar"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"with what people call Exotica?"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"- No."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"- Around the time that there was this kind of surf,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"and I always loved surf music."
01:37:19;01:37:22;"I always buy obscure '60s surf records."
01:37:22;01:37:23;"Around the time there was kind of a surf"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"and garage revival in the '90s,"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"there was also a renewed interest in music"
01:37:29;01:37:33;"made by people like Esquivel and Martin Denny."
01:37:33;01:37:36;"It was related to big band music and sometimes Latin music."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"- Yeah, it was kind of like Hawaiian shirt,"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"hi-fi music, like a record to put on"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"while you made like Mai Tais"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"in your suburban basement bar."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"You can picture what that stuff sounds like."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"- Life's good, man."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"- Like Oregon music."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"- Oh yeah."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"- Kind of slightly creepy, vibey,"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Hawaiian shirt Mai Tai music."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"And so anyway, in a lot of these magazines"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"and catalogs that would cover it,"
01:37:57;01:37:58;"it would always be,"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"featuring the best surf, garage, and Exotica."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"I'm sure the Smash Mouth guys know what I'm talking about."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"So did Smash Mouth--"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"- Ever play Gilman Street?"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"- Ever play Gilman?"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"And what's it called, 624 Gilman?"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"- I thought it was just called Gilman Street."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- 924 Gilman?"
01:38:12;01:38:13;"They ever cross paths?"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Well, I guess at that point,"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"Green Day was already really big."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Play a show with Rancid or something?"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"- If they did, the internet doesn't remember it."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"- Maybe it was such a thriving scene in San Jose."
01:38:23;01:38:26;"And by the way, Seinfeld, this is a true number crunch."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"- Oh yeah."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"- So Jake's talking about San Jose,"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"like it's some podunk town."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"Where does San Jose fall"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"in terms of the size of American cities?"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Is it top 10?"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"- I bet it's right."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"- Oh, I don't think so."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"- I bet it's right at number 10."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"10 or 11 or nine or--"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"- You think you know American cities that well, Seinfeld?"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"- Yeah, I mean, I would vouch that it's not in the top 10."
01:38:45;01:38:48;"- I bet it's the second biggest city in California."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"- Oh my God, it's number 10."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"- It's number 10?"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"- Called it, dude."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"- It's the 10th biggest city in America?"
01:38:54;01:38:55;"Well, 'cause it's definitely bigger"
01:38:55;01:38:55;"than San Francisco's the smallest city."
01:38:55;01:38:58;"- Wow. - Yeah, San Francisco's 700,000."
01:38:58;01:39:01;"- It's just over a million people."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Second to Dallas, Texas."
01:39:03;01:39:07;"- Oh, Dallas, you shine with an evil light."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"- You mean Dallas is number nine?"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"- Dallas is number nine."
01:39:09;01:39:13;"- Well, anyway, I want to get some of the Smash Mouth guys on."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"You know who knows them from back in the days?"
01:39:15;01:39:18;"Ariel, 'cause Ariel's '90s band,"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"the Hippos, like toured with them or something."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"- Oh, wow."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"- Anyway, I always like Smash Mouth."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"- Where are we?"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"- It's number five."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"- Okay. - We gotta pick up the pace."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"- Yep."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"- Number five of 99, number five today."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Hot Girl Summer featuring Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"This is Megan Thee Stallion."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"(hip hop music)"
01:39:36;01:39:41;"- This song is called Hot Girl Summer?"
01:39:41;01:39:42;"- Yeah."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"- I've seen this reference on Twitter."
01:39:43;01:39:45;"- Yeah, yeah, right, it's a big reference now."
01:39:45;01:39:48;"It's like, I think Megan Thee Stallion popularized"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"the phrase and then made the song,"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"'cause after all, it's famous."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"- That's correct, yeah."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"- What is the artist's name?"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"- Megan Thee Stallion."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"- Megan Thee Stallion?"

01:39:59;01:40:00;"- Yeah, Megan."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"- Thee."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"- Like M-E-G-A-N."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"- Yep, Thee."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"- Stallion."

01:40:53;01:40:54;"- What does that mean?"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"- Like if you show up to a buddy's house,"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"there's a cooler of brew in the car."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"- At all times?"
01:41:01;01:41:02;"- Yes."
01:41:02;01:41:02;"- And how does one have--"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"- So you would always keep it in there?"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"- Yeah, it was always a cooler of brew."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"- So you're always just filling it with ice?"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"- Yeah, and brewing."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"- Get a lot of melted water situations?"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"- Yes."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"- Just you doing this, or this is a good community thing?"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"- Eh, small community."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"- Hot Girl Summer, in my day,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"it was cooler of brew in the car summer."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"What happened? - Cooler summer."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"What's a good, like, TC summer theme?"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"I don't want it to be some gross food."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"- I don't know, maybe just getting older."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"My mind just goes to health-related things."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Vegan summer."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"- Right, right, yeah."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"- It's also the election year, right?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"- Summer of pushups."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"- Let's abstain from things."
01:41:39;01:41:39;"- Summer of Bernie."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"- And put ourselves through--"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- No Fap Summer."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"- Physical exertion."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"What is it?"
01:41:45;01:41:46;"- No Fap Summer?"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- No Fap?"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"- Oh God, this is a crazy episode."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Jake, you're not familiar with the No Fap Movement?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"- No, what's that?"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Wait, F-A-P?"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"- Yeah."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- God, I feel like a grandpa."
01:41:55;01:41:58;"I'm just like, what is, who is this?"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"- Fap is internet slang for masturbation."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"- Whoa, wait."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"- I think it's onomatopoeia."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"- What's the derivation?"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Wait, tell me."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"- Onomatopoeia."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"- Oh, okay, gotcha."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"- So anyway, there's been a movement for a long time"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"where people claim that there's health benefits,"
01:42:11;01:42:15;"mental clarity, things like that, to abstaining from--"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"- Not mental clarity, maybe mentally clouding."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"- There's an argument to the opposite effect"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"that it focuses you up and makes you more attractive"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"to the opposite sex."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"- I don't think it focuses you up."
01:42:25;01:42:26;"- All right, Jake, you're gonna get Jake."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"- I think it deludes you."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"I think it makes you insane."
01:42:28;01:42:29;"- Right, but Jake, you don't know"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"what you're walking into here."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"These are passionate community of people"
01:42:34;01:42:37;"who've spent years doing their own research on this,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"and they feel very strongly about this,"
01:42:39;01:42:42;"so you're walking into a minefield right now."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"- So how long would they go?"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"- Some people have gone years."
01:42:45;01:42:48;"- Are they having sex, or is it just no--"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"- I think you can have sex,"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"but some people abstain from sex, too."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"- I think the goal's forever."
01:42:52;01:42:56;"- Well, it's also like, fine, be my guest, don't (beep)"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"- Great, good for you."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"- So you're fine with it."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"- Well, they don't need your--"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"- Well, but I just don't understand--"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"- Jake, I don't think they need"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"your kind of condescending praise."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"These guys are at such a high level mentally that--"
01:43:09;01:43:12;"- Yeah, but I don't need them dictating to me"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"how to achieve mental clarity."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"It's like, you do you."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Like, you don't have to attach all these other--"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"- I don't know if they're fascists about it."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"I don't know if they wanna impose it."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"They probably feel bad for you."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"- And you."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"- I'm a member of the community, Jake."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"I look, mask off, you know what?"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"How do you think I achieved this level of mental clarity?"
01:43:30;01:43:33;"- You are very lucid today on the program."
01:43:33;01:43:35;"- Yeah, I wanna make this show better."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"New rules, summer, fall, winter, spring."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"- No pizza, no brew."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"- Where does all this stuff take place, Seinfeld?"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"It's all on Reddit?"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"- Reddit, I was reading about NoFap"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"about a week ago, actually."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"- Were you?"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"- I was, yeah, 'cause I was looking for clarity."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"And it originated on Reddit,"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"and then it actually became so popular, the subreddit,"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"that I believe it branched out into its own thing."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"- Oh, it's like its own Reddit"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"with subreddits within the NoFap community?"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"- I think it broke out."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"- Okay. - Yeah."
01:44:03;01:44:04;"- Well, Jake, give it a try for the next two weeks"
01:44:04;01:44:07;"and report back for the next TC."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Jake comes in here and in two weeks,"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"just like walking on air, super mental clarity,"
01:44:11;01:44:15;"just like, you know, guys, I used to do a cooler summer"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"and I bruised my friends."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Man, I didn't know what I was missing."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"This is what it's all about, fellas."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"The number four song in 99,"

01:44:50;01:44:52;"- You're not a record industry man."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"- Yeah, I have like impulses,"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"but I tend to just think of it as like,"

01:44:58;01:45:00;"I have impulses about what I'm doing."

01:50:42;01:50:44;"Just all Chinese food?"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt"
01:50:46;01:50:50;"that he's trying to make this impressionistic portrait"
01:50:50;01:50:54;"of one summer and rather than him being that much"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"of a psycho piece of (beep)"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"that he's just like,"
01:50:56;01:50:59;"the cuisine of that one billion Chinese people"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"is absolutely disgusting."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"I'm willing to believe that he's impressionistically"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"referencing like a time that summer"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"when he got sick from eating too much Chinese food."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"- The one spot at the strip mall, Chinese."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"- But hey, if that explanation is not enough"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"for you know, a Chinese restaurateur"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"who probably heard this song and made their skin crawl,"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"I'm not gonna fight them on that."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"But that aside,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits."
01:51:22;01:51:25;"Painting a picture, Chinese food makes me sick."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"Crazy non sequitur."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"But that's also him letting you know"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"that this is like, you know it's Proustian."
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Another adjective based on an author's name"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"that who I've read about 30 pages of."
01:51:35;01:51:39;"I've always been meaning to go deeper on Proust."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"You ever read Proust, Jake?"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"- No, I'm heavy on Nosgard."
01:51:43;01:51:44;"- Oh yeah."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"- Who's compared to Proust."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"- Yeah."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"- But Nosgard's contemporary so I gravitate to him."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- Yeah, one summer off."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"We should do Summer of Proust."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"- Oh dude."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- Proustian summer."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"- TC's Proustian summer."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"- Marcel Proust."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"(laughing)"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Marcel Proust makes me sick."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"'Cause Dave Makovich from Chromia,"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"you know he studied French literature"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"so he's always talking about Proust."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"- I did not know that."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"- I think the writers of the song,"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"they understand that you can't sum up the past"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"in a tidy way so immediately they're letting us know"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"that this is an impressionistic song."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"So you're like okay, is this gonna be like"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"a CNN look back at 1990?"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits."
01:52:24;01:52:27;"George H.W. Bush was in the White House"
01:52:27;01:52:30;"and the stock market was recovering from the,"
01:52:30;01:52:31;"what, you know?"
01:52:31;01:52:31;"- Yeah."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"- They're like, is that what they're setting us up for?"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Then Crazy Left Turn, Chinese Food Makes Me Sick."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"They're mixing this kind of grand cultural thing"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"while it's playing on the radio"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"with this very specific problematic"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"remembrance of a time Chinese food made him sick."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"And then he twists it yet again."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"And I think it's Fly When Girls Stop By"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"for the summer, for the summer."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"- Stop by?"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"- Maybe he's like a townie."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"- Oh yeah, it's like a summer relationship."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"It's like a summer fling."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"- He's a townie in a lake town."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"- The rich girls from the suburbs coming up."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"- Yeah."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"- There's the small town Chinese restaurant."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"- Yeah, he's a lake townie."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"The rich suburban girls come."
01:53:06;01:53:09;"- He's working the landscaping gig in the summer."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"- Yeah, oh and maybe when he says"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"the Chinese food makes him sick,"
01:53:12;01:53:15;"again, he wouldn't dream of impugning the quality"
01:53:15;01:53:18;"of one of the world's great cuisine cultures."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"He's just saying, you know what?"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"I'm not a member of the country club."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"I can't go, you know, eat club sandwiches"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"at the country club."
01:53:25;01:53:28;"So I had to use my meager paycheck"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"to go to the worst Chinese restaurant in town"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"and it made me sick."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"- That's before the Panda opened."
01:53:33;01:53:36;"- Yeah, we didn't have Panda Express."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"I know in your rich suburb,"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"you probably go eat Panda Express at the mall."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"Here, in a lake town, it's not like that."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"We have one really bad Chinese restaurant."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch."
01:53:46;01:53:50;"Again, rich suburban mall girls."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"They eat Panda Express."
01:53:51;01:53:52;"It's not gonna make you sick."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"It's gonna make you feel good."
01:53:54;01:53:54;"And they wear Abercrombie and Fitch."
01:53:54;01:53:57;"- It makes you feel great."
01:53:57;01:53:59;"- I'd take her if I had one wish,"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"but she's been gone since that summer."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"You know, it tracks."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"It really tracks."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"He's a working class lake townie."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Seinfeld, search in quotes, lake townie."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Is that a thing?"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"- It's gotta be."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"- There's all different types of townies,"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"but a lake townie?"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"- Yeah."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"- Summer girls."
01:54:15;01:54:18;"- So I found the phrase lake townie"
01:54:18;01:54:19;"in the Hartford Courant"
01:54:19;01:54:23;"in a review of the film Beethoven from 1993,"
01:54:23;01:54:28;"referring to a motorcycling lake townie named Seth."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"(laughing)"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Played by a young Danny Masterson."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Oh wow."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"- And then there's also the show Riverdale."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- More contemporary."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"- Yeah, and Riverdale is set in Shadow Lake,"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"and so they refer to this character Cassidy as a townie,"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"so Shadow Lake Townie Cassidy."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"- She's a lake townie."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- Whoa."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- Hip hop mama, spick and span,"

01:59:51;01:59:53;"And so all these songs just really hit me"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"with this nostalgia, maybe because it was like,"
01:59:55;01:59:56;"yeah, I just finished my freshman year"

02:00:11;02:00:13;"- It'd probably be a pretty cool hang."
02:00:13;02:00:14;"- This is where the Days Between,"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"in terms of how you feel about music changes,"
02:00:16;02:00:19;"between 12, I wouldn't even go all the way up to 18,"
02:00:19;02:00:21;"I'd say between 12 and 15."
02:00:21;02:00:24;"Once you're 16, it's like, I don't know, things change."
02:00:24;02:00:27;"But between 12 and 15, it's just like,"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"it's a funny period. - You know what was huge?"
02:00:29;02:00:30;"I can't say if it was number one or not,"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"but huge when I was 14."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"- What?"
02:00:33;02:00:34;"- Smells Like Teen Spirit."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"- Ah."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"- Straight up."
02:00:36;02:00:39;"- Yeah, see, I never got to hear that song new, really."
02:00:39;02:00:42;"I'm just so perfectly of that age."
02:00:42;02:00:44;"- Yeah, there was no cool rock music"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"when I was coming of age."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"And then the Strokes came out and the White Stripes"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"when I was 17."
02:00:50;02:00:51;"And so I liked it. - That's pretty good."
02:00:51;02:00:53;"- No, no, it was good, but I was already,"
02:00:53;02:00:56;"I don't know how to put it, between 11--"
02:00:56;02:00:57;"- I was over it, man."
02:00:57;02:00:58;"- I was a little bit over it."
02:00:58;02:00:59;"And no, and I love those bands."
02:00:59;02:01:00;"- Sure."
02:01:00;02:01:02;"- I just already was kind of,"
02:01:02;02:01:05;"I didn't have the wide-eyed love of music anymore."
02:01:05;02:01:08;"I was just on some other (beep)."
02:01:08;02:01:08;"- The Strokes were like, yeah, yeah,"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"I've heard Lou Reed on television."
02:01:10;02:01:11;"Yeah, it's great."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"I like what you guys are doing."
02:01:12;02:01:13;"- No, I was like, these guys are great."
02:01:13;02:01:14;"I love them."
02:01:14;02:01:16;"I wanna study their songs and see what they're doing."
02:01:16;02:01:18;"But I think I already was like,"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"it already fired me up to start my own band."
02:01:20;02:01:24;"I wasn't a wide-eyed kid just taking music in"
02:01:24;02:01:29;"and thinking about my crushes and like,"
02:01:29;02:01:30;"wow, what's high school gonna be like?"
02:01:30;02:01:31;"It's just such a different time."
02:01:31;02:01:32;"And then you're like--"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"- You were already attached."
02:01:33;02:01:35;"- I was 17 and I was kind of like,"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"all right, the Strokes, okay."
02:01:37;02:01:38;"Excellent song."
02:01:38;02:01:42;"I was almost on some early professionalism (beep)"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"where I was like, well done, fellas."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"Okay, interesting."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"- Noted."
02:01:47;02:01:48;"- Noted, yeah."
02:01:48;02:01:51;"The competition has come strong."
02:01:51;02:01:54;"- The gauntlet has been thrown."
02:01:54;02:01:55;"- And it wasn't even that strong."
02:01:55;02:01:58;"And actually I remember me and Wes's band,"
02:01:58;02:01:59;"our high school band,"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"we would mess around and play someday."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"And I just remember learning how to play those chords"
02:02:03;02:02:04;"and I was like, oh, this is cool."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"I like what they did."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"It was kind of the first time when a band came out"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"and yeah, and I was just like very familiar"
02:02:10;02:02:11;"with the references already."
02:02:11;02:02:12;"'Cause that was also extremely my (beep)"
02:02:12;02:02:15;"was like television and Velvet Underground."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"- Yeah."
02:02:16;02:02:17;"- So I totally loved it."
02:02:17;02:02:18;"Yeah, I don't know how to explain it though."
02:02:18;02:02:19;"It's just like--"
02:02:19;02:02:20;"- No, I get it."
02:02:20;02:02:21;"- I think when you're a little kid,"
02:02:21;02:02:23;"obviously everything's just washing over you."
02:02:23;02:02:24;"- Yeah."
02:02:24;02:02:27;"- But then there's something about like that tweenage,"
02:02:27;02:02:28;"early teen years that's just very unique."
02:02:28;02:02:29;"Yeah, by the way--"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"- I think you're just like learning the archetypes"
02:02:31;02:02:32;"at that age."
02:02:32;02:02:32;"- Yeah."
02:02:32;02:02:34;"- And then you start to understand like,"
02:02:34;02:02:37;"oh, people are influenced by things."
02:02:37;02:02:39;"They build off the other things."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"- Yeah."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"- It's not as like,"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"and with each successive generation of music,"
02:02:43;02:02:44;"you learn about--"
02:02:44;02:02:45;"- It's a little less magical."
02:02:45;02:02:46;"- Exactly."
02:02:46;02:02:46;"- Or something."
02:02:46;02:02:48;"And again, it doesn't mean you don't respect it"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"or you don't like it 'cause I love the strokes."
02:02:50;02:02:52;"- You're like, I see the structure."
02:02:52;02:02:53;"I get it."
02:02:53;02:02:53;"- Yeah, it was just different."
02:02:53;02:02:54;"- Yeah."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"- But this music just reminds me of like passively like,"
02:02:56;02:03:00;"yeah, being those ages and just kind of being like,"
02:03:00;02:03:03;"I would actually say the summer after my freshman year,"
02:03:03;02:03:05;"I would say was like my last summer of childhood."
02:03:05;02:03:06;"- Damn, dude."
02:03:06;02:03:09;"- I just remember that summer still kind of like,"
02:03:09;02:03:12;"I don't know, going on like trampolines."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"And obviously things were changing, you know,"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"people were having like boyfriends and girlfriends"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"and there were definitely some like,"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"you know, it's not the same as being 11."
02:03:20;02:03:21;"But I just do remember after that summer,"
02:03:21;02:03:24;"for whatever reason, my sophomore year just like sucked."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"I didn't like it that much."
02:03:26;02:03:28;"The first time I ever got like super high"
02:03:28;02:03:30;"and drunk was my sophomore year."
02:03:30;02:03:31;"- Oh, wow."
02:03:31;02:03:33;"- I got a little drunk in freshman year"
02:03:33;02:03:34;"and maybe in eighth grade,"
02:03:34;02:03:36;"but just the first time I got like super stoned,"
02:03:36;02:03:37;"like, whoa, what the (beep)"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"and it was crazy was my sophomore year."
02:03:39;02:03:42;"So there's something about this music reminds me"

02:07:15;02:07:18;"there was a headphone setup with Eagles greatest hits."

02:07:46;02:07:47;"This was my first cell phone, by the way, too."
