00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back in effect."
00:03;00:07;"I'm joined by Jake, a man who's about to get married."
00:07;00:11;"Slash got married. Depends how you look at it."
00:11;00:17;"We'll be talking about Time Crisis topics, like John Mayer, The Grateful Dead."
00:17;00:20;"Maybe even Boz Skax."
00:20;00:22;"Lot of guitarists."
00:22;00:23;"This is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis, with Eds Runkainen."
00:27;00:30;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:30;00:31;"One."
00:31;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:37;00:44;"They were a pal to a manly, all my rightful chances"
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:09;01:14;"He's the lonely man"
01:14;01:17;"Time Crisis, September 24th, 2017."
01:17;01:21;"Jake and I are not actually recording on September 24th."
01:21;01:23;"We're doing a real early one right now."
01:23;01:26;"The reason being, there's a lot of reasons why we're recording early."
01:26;01:30;"The most important is that Jake's about to get married."
01:30;01:34;"He will have gotten married by the time you're hearing this."
01:34;01:36;"So congratulations, Jake."
01:36;01:37;"Thank you."
01:37;01:42;"I feel like we haven't really talked much about your engagement/marriage on the show."
01:42;01:45;"Well, I'm a private person."
01:45;01:47;"Jake really values his privacy."
01:47;01:53;"I mean, we don't have to get into specific details, but just on a basic level..."
01:53;01:56;"The wedding went well, went great."
01:56;01:57;"You think the wedding went well?"
01:57;01:58;"It was everything I could have dreamed of."
01:58;02:00;"Maybe just on some basic questions."
02:00;02:02;"First marriage?"
02:02;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:07;"I was asked that recently. Who asked me that?"
02:07;02:09;"Oh, oh, okay."
02:09;02:11;"So this is kind of funny, actually."
02:11;02:13;"Our wedding announcement is going to be in the New York Times."
02:13;02:18;"Because Hannah's mom, Linda Greenhouse, used to work for the Times."
02:18;02:21;"And so she was like, ""Hannah, you should really try to get your wedding announcement in the Times."""
02:21;02:23;"It's like something that..."
02:23;02:24;"Oh, yeah, I love that."
02:24;02:29;"So it's like some New York real estate guy marrying someone that went to Vassar or something."
02:29;02:32;"Yeah, it's always like Ivy League doctors and lawyers."
02:32;02:35;"Wait, so is it going to be Jake Longstreth, son of..."
02:35;02:36;"Yeah."
02:36;02:37;"From Connecticut."
02:37;02:38;"Yeah."
02:38;02:39;"What's your town again in Connecticut?"
02:39;02:40;"Southbury."
02:40;02:42;"Jake Longstreth of Southbury, Connecticut."
02:42;02:47;"Yeah, and I went into very elaborate detail with this person from the Times about..."
02:47;02:48;"Because they were interviewing you."
02:48;02:49;"About my parents' careers."
02:49;02:50;"Right."
02:50;02:51;"What did they want?"
02:51;02:52;"They wanted all of the..."
02:52;02:54;"I couldn't believe the level of detail they wanted."
02:54;02:58;"They were like, ""Well, when your mom worked for the state of Connecticut in the chief state's attorney's office,"
02:58;03:00;"was that in Rocky Hill or Wallingford?"""
03:00;03:02;"And I'm like, ""I don't know."""
03:02;03:04;"Like they moved offices at some point in the '90s."
03:04;03:05;"That's sick."
03:05;03:10;"Do you think they'll mention brother Dave Longstreth of Indie Rock Band Dirty Projectors?"
03:10;03:11;"Well, I think so."
03:11;03:13;"And actually, you know what's funny, man?"
03:13;03:14;"Time Crisis..."
03:14;03:15;"Might get a mention?"
03:15;03:17;"Well, I was debating whether to mention it."
03:17;03:18;"Yeah."
03:18;03:20;"I actually leaned against mentioning it."
03:20;03:21;"Fair enough."
03:21;03:22;"I don't know why, though."
03:22;03:23;"I was sort of like, ""That seems like..."
03:23;03:24;"I mean, it's a fun show."
03:24;03:25;"I love the show."""
03:25;03:28;"No, but first and foremost, you're a painter."
03:28;03:29;"Right, I'm an art..."
03:29;03:30;"Yeah."
03:30;03:31;"No offense taken."
03:31;03:34;"You certainly don't want to be known as a Time Crisis host."
03:34;03:39;"Even though my Wikipedia page says artist/radio personality."
03:39;03:43;"Wait, isn't it American painter/radio personality?"
03:43;03:45;"Well, as long as the painter's first."
03:45;03:46;"Yeah, yeah."
03:46;03:47;"I know, but I can understand."
03:47;03:48;"New York Times is kind of high stakes."
03:48;03:50;"You don't want it to say like..."
03:50;03:55;"Noted Beats 1 radio host Jake Longstreth recently tied the knot."
03:55;03:57;"No, it's probably more formal language than that."
03:57;04:00;"So they asked me, they were like, ""Is this your first marriage?"""
04:00;04:01;"Yeah."
04:01;04:02;"And I was like, ""Yep."""
04:02;04:03;"I thought it was like a funny question."
04:03;04:06;"Like, if it was my second marriage, would it say that?"
04:06;04:09;"Would it say, ""Mr. Longstreth, previously married."""
04:09;04:10;"Yeah, that'd be crazy."
04:10;04:15;"It's like, if somebody really wanted their wedding announcement to be in the New York Times,"
04:15;04:18;"probably the last thing you would want is to be like,"
04:18;04:25;"previously married to this person who probably is not psyched about being mentioned."
04:25;04:26;"Well, that's tight."
04:26;04:28;"So that might be out today."
04:28;04:29;"Yeah, Sunday the 24th."
04:29;04:30;"The day of the airing."
04:30;04:33;"Everyone go pick up a Sunday Times."
04:33;04:34;"I love that."
04:34;04:38;"Flip to the wedding or vow section."
04:38;04:39;"That's incredible."
04:39;04:41;"We did a stressful headshot."
04:41;04:42;"Yeah, headshot."
04:42;04:43;"We just did it this morning."
04:43;04:44;"We forgot to get it to them."
04:44;04:45;"iPhone?"
04:45;04:46;"Just selfie?"
04:46;04:47;"Yep, iPhone selfie."
04:47;04:50;"And we also tried on Hannah's laptop."
04:50;04:51;"Yeah."
04:51;04:53;"To like try to do that, but like it's too low res."
04:53;04:54;"What were you wearing in the picture?"
04:54;04:55;"T-shirt."
04:55;04:56;"What T-shirt?"
04:56;04:58;"A Sweet Martha's cookie jar?"
04:58;05:00;"No, just a gray T-shirt that says, ""Chill out."""
05:00;05:01;"I was wondering, okay."
05:01;05:03;"But you can't see the chill out."
05:03;05:06;"I want to point out, it's also an ash gray T-shirt."
05:06;05:07;"Yeah."
05:07;05:08;"Kind of like a gym T-shirt."
05:08;05:11;"I think it's a black and white photo though, but maybe I'm wrong."
05:11;05:13;"Wait, why does the T-shirt say, ""Chill out?"""
05:13;05:14;"What is that?"
05:14;05:15;"I don't know."
05:15;05:16;"Hannah got this from me."
05:16;05:18;"At like a truck stop?"
05:18;05:19;"Yeah."
05:19;05:22;"It's like a funny, dumb T-shirt."
05:22;05:23;"It just says, ""Chill out."""
05:23;05:25;"[laughs]"
05:25;05:26;"It's not the worst advice."
05:26;05:30;"Mr. Longstreth, pictured above in an ash gray, ""Chill out"" T-shirt."
05:30;05:32;"Hopefully the photo is acceptable."
05:32;05:37;"They were very intense and specific about the specs in the photo."
05:37;05:38;"Well, think about it."
05:38;05:42;"Most people who are probably sending in their photo are probably having like a big, fancy wedding."
05:42;05:43;"Yeah."
05:43;05:47;"They get a professional photographer, and they probably do their makeup and stuff."
05:47;05:50;"You guys are just sending in a laptop picture."
05:50;05:57;"We actually went to the Huntington Gardens a month ago and had our friend, who has a nice SLR,"
05:57;06:00;"shoot photos of us, and we were wearing nice clothes."
06:00;06:01;"Yeah."
06:01;06:05;"I'm a solid seven inches taller than Hannah."
06:05;06:06;"Right."
06:06;06:08;"Our heads are at different levels."
06:08;06:09;"Right."
06:09;06:14;"I talked to the Times person last week, and they were like, ""We need to have your heads at the same level."""
06:14;06:15;"We can't have--"
06:15;06:16;"Right."
06:16;06:17;"It's just like a tight, cropped headshot."
06:17;06:18;"Yeah."
06:18;06:21;"Then we were like, ""Oh, okay,"" and then we forgot about it."
06:21;06:24;"Then this morning, Hannah was like, ""Oh, my God."
06:24;06:26;"We have to send in the headshots."""
06:26;06:28;"Then I'm like crouching."
06:28;06:29;"Right."
06:29;06:30;"I'm doing like a squat."
06:30;06:33;"Speaking of that, I went to the Emmys, but one thing I noticed is that--"
06:33;06:36;"Okay, so you know when somebody wins an Emmy, and there's a whole crew of people on stage?"
06:36;06:39;"Like when Saturday Night Live wins, and they have 15 people on stage?"
06:39;06:46;"You have the person up front speaking, and then you notice that certain people who'd been around the block would squat a little bit"
06:46;06:50;"because when the camera's focused on the award winner, and you have a whole phalanx of people in the back,"
06:50;06:52;"almost all their heads are getting cut off."
06:52;06:55;"I kept noticing there would be some people--"
06:55;06:57;"Maybe they could kind of see the monitor or something."
06:57;07:02;"There would be some people standing in the back who'd take themselves down like a solid six inches."
07:02;07:05;"In person, you're looking at somebody just squatting on stage."
07:05;07:06;"You're just like, ""What are you doing?"""
07:06;07:09;"Then you look at the live feed, and you're kind of like, ""Oh, all right."""
07:09;07:11;"I guess you want to get your whole face in there."
07:11;07:13;"That's this funny thing that happens at awards shows."
07:13;07:14;"People are just like--"
07:14;07:18;"Just like, ""Hold that. Hold that ab. Tighten the stomach up."""
07:18;07:22;"Yeah, straight up, they're doing squats so that their face can be on TV."
07:22;07:24;"Got to have your face on TV."
09:46;09:48;"Did you see Spicer?"
09:48;09:49;"Oh, yeah."
09:49;09:50;"Did you chill with him?"
09:50;09:53;"No, we did not chill with him, but we went to an after party."
09:53;09:56;"Don't tell me-- No, my-- Are you serious?"
09:56;09:57;"He was there."
09:57;10:00;"I mean, were people already aware of the backlash?"
10:00;10:03;"I was in punching distance of Spicer."
10:03;10:04;"Spitting distance?"
10:04;10:07;"He was up in the mix. It was weird."
10:07;10:10;"You know, like, when you're actually sitting in the audience at these award shows,"
10:10;10:13;"it's actually so stupid. It's so much better to watch on TV,"
10:13;10:15;"'cause it's like you're in a big, boomy arena."
10:15;10:17;"You can barely hear what's going on, so you don't really have a--"
10:17;10:19;"So we kind of saw Sean Spicer and were like, ""What?"""
10:19;10:20;"That was really--"
10:20;10:24;"And then, at this party, he was there, and--"
10:24;10:25;"Where was the party?"
10:25;10:29;"It was at a kind of fancy club in Hollywood."
10:29;10:30;"Uh-huh."
10:30;10:31;"A chic little club."
10:31;10:34;"So it's fun. I'm looking around, and you see, like,"
10:34;10:37;"who-- You know, all these big celebrities, Colbert and all these people"
10:37;10:40;"and all the cast of Modern Family and stuff,"
10:40;10:42;"and you just see Sean Spicer."
10:42;10:44;"He-- Was he rolling with a crew?"
10:44;10:47;"Well, this is kind of on our way out."
10:47;10:50;"Actually, we were standing with somebody who kind of saw him,"
10:50;10:51;"and they were like, ""All right."""
10:51;10:53;"'Cause we were already-- They were tired,"
10:53;10:55;"and we were already talking to some people who were like, ""Should we leave?"""
10:55;10:58;"And then we saw him, and everybody was like, ""Yeah, let's bounce."""
10:58;11:04;"But on our way out, he was laughing, yucking it up, having the time of his life."
11:04;11:06;"He was surrounded by a group of people."
11:06;11:09;"None of the, like, kind of famous celebrities we're talking to,"
11:09;11:12;"but he was surrounded by this group of kind of younger people"
11:12;11:14;"that he was, like, cracking jokes with them and stuff,"
11:14;11:16;"and I was like, ""What are they talking about?"
11:16;11:18;"This is so weird."""
11:18;11:19;"Wow."
11:19;11:21;"Not feeling this, and then bounced."
11:21;11:25;"Had you looked at Twitter yet and seen that Twitter was exploding?"
11:25;11:26;"I hadn't."
11:26;11:28;"This is completely inappropriate and insane."
11:28;11:30;"No, that was also funny to be in this bizarre situation,"
11:30;11:32;"just kind of watching it live."
11:32;11:37;"So we were kind of, like, in the ride from the theater to the after party,"
11:37;11:40;"and we hadn't looked at Twitter yet, so we were just like--"
11:40;11:43;"It's also funny 'cause, like, Twitter amplifies stuff in such an extreme way."
11:43;11:45;"So we were just kind of like-- They were like,"
11:45;11:47;"""That was weird that they got Sean Spicer."
11:47;11:49;"Yeah, that didn't seem necessary."""
11:49;11:52;"And we were kind of like, ""Well, I guess it's just for, like, the laughs."""
11:52;11:54;"Probably the audience loved it at home."
11:54;11:57;"I mean, it's still kind of weird to see Twitter that's just like,"
11:57;11:59;"""It's disgusting that these Hollywood fascists"
11:59;12:03;"would even just consider to bring this dude out."""
12:03;12:04;"It's strange."
12:04;12:05;"That's interesting to hear."
12:05;12:08;"I mean, if you were there, you're saying, you know,"
12:08;12:10;"it was just kind of another gag."
12:10;12:13;"'Cause I saw it on Twitter, and I was like, ""Yeah, that is insane."""
12:13;12:15;"Like, it seemed to me like--"
12:15;12:21;"Because I received that news secondhand through this insanely opinionated"
12:21;12:24;"aggregate of people's opinions,"
12:24;12:26;"then it sort of is like, ""Yeah, that is crazy."
12:26;12:28;"That is crazy tone deaf."""
12:28;12:33;"Also, like, Colbert seems so smart and cynical in the best way."
12:33;12:36;"I mean, I guess he kind of roasted him,"
12:36;12:39;"but obviously that's not going to be enough"
12:39;12:43;"when you're talking about, like, you know, real-life politics."
12:43;12:46;"I guess also sitting in the theater, we kind of looked around,"
12:46;12:49;"and so many people had this weird look on their face"
12:49;12:53;"that the atmosphere in the theater was already kind of, like, harsh,"
12:53;12:56;"that people were like, ""Whoa, [bleep] this dude."""
12:56;13:00;"So in a weird way, it almost seemed like the appropriate response--"
13:00;13:02;"Yeah, you know, I guess that's the thing."
13:02;13:04;"Being there and seeing people already be kind of harshed out,"
13:04;13:06;"I was like, ""All right, yeah. People don't like this guy."
13:06;13:10;"They know that he's a--you know, he worked for a really bad person"
13:10;13:12;"spreading lies."""
13:12;13:15;"So that secondary idea of, like, but should he have been there in the first place,"
13:15;13:18;"that only dawned on us later as we were kind of, like, rolling out and being like--"
13:18;13:21;"'cause we actually started to talk about the--you're just there,"
13:21;13:23;"so this guy comes on stage and he leaves,"
13:23;13:25;"and then we're talking about the logistics of it, and we're like,"
13:25;13:27;"""Whoa,"" so they had to reach out to him, be like,"
13:27;13:29;"""You know, can we arrange Mr. Spicer's travel?"
13:29;13:31;"First class, of course. What hotel does he want?"""
13:31;13:33;"And then you start thinking about that stuff, and you're like--"
13:33;13:35;"to put him on TV in front of millions of people,"
13:35;13:37;"and then you're like, ""Oh, yeah, that's insane."""
13:37;13:41;"♪ They're gonna put me in the movies ♪"
13:41;13:46;"♪ They're gonna make a big star out of me ♪"
13:46;13:51;"♪ We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely ♪"

14:38;14:41;"You know what it is? It's become so fashionable now,"
14:41;14:45;"the past 10, 15 years, that everybody has to poke fun at themselves."
14:45;14:47;"It used to be this really--"
14:47;14:50;"Remember, it started maybe in the late '90s"
14:50;14:52;"when some played-out old celebrity would come out"
14:52;14:54;"and have a joke about themselves and be like,"
14:54;14:57;"""Yeah, it's me, the guy from that '70s TV show."""
14:57;14:59;"Or just be like, ""Yeah."""
14:59;15:02;"Or Bob Saget, he was a pioneer of that,"
15:02;15:05;"being like, ""Hey, you probably know me as the dad from Full House."
15:05;15:07;"- Well, guess what?"" - ""I got a filthy mouth."""
15:07;15:12;"""I got a filthy mouth, so suck my d--k, you f--king piece of s--t."""
15:12;15:14;"And it was like, ""Aah!"""
15:14;15:16;"That was really novel at the time to be like,"
15:16;15:18;"""So, p--t, my p--t!"""
15:18;15:20;"And it was like, ""Oh, my God!"""
15:20;15:23;"And then it was also really novel for people to come out and be like,"
15:23;15:26;"""Yeah, you know, I know you hate me."
15:26;15:29;"Well, guess what? I can laugh about it."""
15:29;15:31;"Actually, this year, with Trump in the White House,"
15:31;15:34;"it really felt like that kind of self-referential celebrity stuff"
15:34;15:36;"was coming to an end."
15:36;15:38;"And I think one of the smarter things that I saw pointed out"
15:38;15:40;"about the Sean Spicer thing was they were like,"
15:40;15:43;"""Okay, this is Sean Spicer. This is so soon."
15:43;15:45;"This is how it's going to go down for all these guys."
15:45;15:47;"This is how it's going to go down for Trump."""
15:47;15:49;"I mean, even look at the way, like, Bush can, like,"
15:49;15:52;"have a picture of Michelle Obama giving him a hug and goes viral."
15:52;15:54;"Or like Bush is doing his weird paintings."
15:54;15:56;"Yeah, friendship goals, painting goals."
15:56;15:58;"And it's like, you can totally picture"
15:58;16:03;"in the Comedy Central roast of Donald Trump 2025,"
16:03;16:07;"and he gets up and is like, ""I know I did a few crazy things."
16:07;16:09;"Let's just say I was hanging out with Steve Bannon a little too much."""
16:09;16:11;"Like, everybody's like dying."
16:11;16:15;"I remember we had a joke on this show about Trump doing advertising"
16:15;16:17;"for, like, Rockstar Energy Drink and being like,"
16:17;16:19;"""That was a crazy 18 months."
16:19;16:22;"Not as crazy as the amount of caffeine in the new Rockstar Energy Drink."""
16:22;16:24;"That was a crazy eight years."
16:24;16:25;"Oh, God."
16:25;16:27;"It's so crazy."
16:27;16:31;"You know Trump will go back to, like, bad TV and, like,"
16:31;16:34;"celebrity culture as soon as he's out of office,"
16:34;16:37;"whether he resigns or serves eight years."
16:37;16:38;"He'll find his way in."
16:38;16:39;"He'll just find it."
16:39;16:41;"Although, look, there's going to be opposition to it, which is good."
16:41;16:43;"But you know what also is interesting?"
16:43;16:47;"Remember in the O.J. documentary series, O.J. Made in America?"
16:47;16:48;"Yeah."
16:48;16:52;"Now, in the mid-'90s, most people believed that he did, in fact,"
16:52;16:53;"murder two people."
16:53;16:54;"Yeah."
16:54;16:57;"His wife was an abusive spouse to his ex-wife."
16:57;17:02;"So when he got free, they talk about how he wasn't welcomed back into polite society."
17:02;17:05;"He tried to go to the same Brentwood, Beverly Hills restaurants."
17:05;17:06;"It didn't work."
17:06;17:07;"He had to, like, move to Florida."
17:07;17:09;"His career was kind of messed up."
17:09;17:11;"I don't know what he expected, but clearly people iced him out."
17:11;17:15;"And there's some part of me that feels like on one level in 2017 people are more"
17:15;17:18;"sensitive than ever, call out everything."
17:18;17:22;"And then there's this equally strong oppositional force that's just as extreme,"
17:22;17:26;"if not more extreme, that's kind of like you can laugh about everything."
17:26;17:30;"So weirdly, I almost feel like if the O.J. thing had happened in 2017,"
17:30;17:34;"he also because of social media, even if they didn't let him into his Brentwood"
17:34;17:37;"restaurant, he could just be like, ""All right, let me throw an Instagram Live."
17:37;17:39;"What's up, O.J. family? I'm here."
17:39;17:41;"These jackasses won't let me in."""
17:41;17:44;"He could become like in the same way Alex Jones can talk directly to his fan base."
17:44;17:45;"Right."
17:45;17:48;"If you're O.J. or something, ""Okay, these snooty people don't want to let me"
17:48;17:51;"in the restaurant anymore,"" he'd weirdly have more of a career now."
17:51;17:52;"Yeah."
17:52;17:56;"There probably were a bunch of people after O.J. who would have supported him,"
17:56;18:01;"but the mainstream media wouldn't help him, so he had to do weird straight-to-video"
18:01;18:04;"prank shows and stuff, club appearances."
18:04;18:09;"But even the people that aren't fans, as clearly is the case with Spicer,"
18:09;18:13;"are on board with immediately making it a joke again."
18:13;18:15;"That's interesting. Yeah, 2017."
18:15;18:17;"I mean, it's like all--"
18:17;18:23;"One month after the acquittal, O.J. on Colbert Tonight."
18:23;18:24;"Now--"
18:24;18:27;"I bet Stern would have him on."
18:27;18:28;"Jesus."
18:28;18:30;"That will happen, don't you think?"
18:30;18:31;"Okay, so let me get this straight."
18:31;18:33;"Did you kill your wife?"
18:33;18:35;"Come on. Just tell us."
18:35;18:37;"Imagine if he just admits it on Stern."
18:37;18:39;"Howard, you get people to say the crazy--"
18:39;18:41;"Yeah, I did it."
18:41;18:42;"Come on."
18:42;18:44;"Howard, you're the master."
18:44;18:47;"Howard, you are-- Okay."
18:47;18:48;"Come on."
18:48;18:51;"Okay, even if Howard Stern wouldn't have him on, even if Colbert wouldn't have him on,"
18:51;18:57;"I'm picturing, like, 2017, O.J. acquittal, immediately comes out of prison,"
18:57;18:59;"10 million Twitter followers."
18:59;19:01;"The Instagram is popping."
19:01;19:02;"I mean, think about that."
19:02;19:05;"Trump's going to have millions of--"
19:05;19:06;"Ugh."
19:06;19:07;"Brutal."
19:20;19:24;"I like that second one."
19:52;19:54;"I like that."
20:21;20:22;"Gumbo."
20:51;20:54;"You want to know what's more important than throwing away money in a strip club?"
20:54;20:56;"Credit."
20:56;21:01;"You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America?"
21:01;21:03;"That's how they did it."
21:03;21:06;"Financial freedom, my only hope."
21:06;21:09;"Living rich and dying broke."
21:09;21:12;"I bought some artwork for one million."
21:12;21:15;"Two years later, that shit worth two million."
21:15;21:18;"Two years later, that shit worth eight million."
21:18;21:20;"I can't wait to get this shit with my children."
21:20;21:22;"Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine."
21:22;21:25;"But I'm trying to give you a million dollars' worth of game for $9.99."
21:25;21:28;"I turn a two to a four, four to an eight."
21:28;21:30;"I turned my life into a nice first week release date."
21:30;21:31;"Mmm."
21:31;21:34;"Y'all here still taking advances, huh?"
21:34;21:37;"Me and my niggas taking real chances, uh."
21:37;21:39;"You're on the gram, holding money to your ear."
21:39;21:42;"There's a disconnect, we don't pull that money over here, yeah."
21:42;21:45;"Light jigga, dark jigga, faux jigga, real jigga."
21:45;21:49;"Rich jigga, pole jigga, house jigga, feel jigga."
21:49;21:52;"Still jigga."
21:52;21:54;"Still jigga."
21:54;21:55;"You see me?"
21:55;22:03;"Light jigga, dark jigga, faux jigga, real jigga."
22:03;22:06;"Rich jigga, pole jigga, house jigga, feel jigga."
22:06;22:07;"Well, we got a hell of a show."
22:07;22:10;"Even though we're pre-taping, we're still bringing"
22:10;22:13;"that classic time crisis energy."
22:13;22:17;"We're going to be listening to the top five songs from today and 1976."
22:17;22:20;"We're going to be talking about Boz Skaggs, John Mayer,"
22:20;22:24;"The Grateful Dead, The Juggalo March."
22:24;22:25;"There's so much to go deep on, man."
22:25;22:27;"Just all the best music."
22:27;22:28;"Exactly."
22:28;22:34;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
22:34;22:37;"They see each other for the first time as kids in school."
22:37;22:40;"This simple boy meets girl, they grab and they say, I do."
22:40;22:44;"My heart racing, correlating, the fact"
22:44;22:47;"it only seems to make them."
22:47;22:54;"The lost boys, the lost girls, where are all my lost boys?"
22:54;23:01;"Always be yourself and never give them a shame."
23:01;23:04;"See, the only real change is realising the same."
23:04;23:06;"I've been chopping up, roving, carving up."
23:06;23:08;"Everybody used to say I'm strange."
23:08;23:09;"I'm opening their minds."
23:09;23:11;"It used to be so engaged."
23:11;23:13;"Serenade pieces that are broken."
23:13;23:15;"Turn the pill once you let the picture flip,"
23:15;23:17;"then you can start to move the wheels."
23:17;23:18;"Love is never straightforward."
23:18;23:20;"It bends and it kills."
23:20;23:23;"Regardless of who you're loving, Orlando's still with the world."
23:23;23:26;"Yo, keep doing what you do."
23:26;23:30;"Just because they say their love don't look like you,"
23:30;23:32;"I know I'm bound to."
23:32;23:35;"Because you and me, we're like a spoon."
23:35;23:38;"So don't let the witch fool."
23:38;23:42;"Because they say their love don't look like you."
23:42;23:48;"Oh, if they only knew that me and you were lost bones."
23:48;23:49;"Yo, save the judge."
23:49;23:51;"Man said again, said he'd change the nurse."
23:51;23:52;"All I want to do is just salvage us."
23:52;23:54;"And everybody looking at me like I'm an angel."
23:54;23:55;"Though it's as if it took some time to be brave enough."
23:55;23:57;"Like being yourself is just dangerous."
23:57;23:59;"Hold up, giving up the aim enough to keep us down."
23:59;24:01;"Hook on all of us though."
24:01;24:03;"Whoever they're living in any hemisphere,"
24:03;24:06;"never fear being considered weird or irregular."
24:06;24:09;"And all of yourself to be void of the shelf."
24:09;24:11;"Because when they said actions speak louder,"
24:11;24:13;"it was with a mouth."
24:13;24:15;"Keep doing what you do."
24:15;24:19;"Just because they say their love don't look like you,"
24:19;24:21;"I know I'm bound to."
24:21;24:25;"Because you and me, we're like a spoon."
24:25;24:27;"So don't let the witch fool."
24:27;24:31;"Because they say their love don't look like you."
24:31;24:37;"Oh, if they only knew that me and you were lost bones."
24:40;24:50;"You know, you know, you know, you know."
24:50;24:56;"Please don't say so much as I'm breaking for you."
24:56;25:02;"I never knew how everybody is a bummer."
25:02;25:04;"Keep doing what you do."
25:04;25:08;"Just because they say their love don't look like you,"
25:08;25:11;"I know I'm bound to."
25:11;25:14;"Because you and me, we're like a spoon."
25:14;25:17;"So don't let the witch fool."
25:17;25:21;"Because they say their love don't look like you."
25:21;25:27;"Oh, if they only knew that me and you were lost bones."
25:27;25:29;"Hello."
25:29;25:32;"It's me."
25:32;25:35;"Is there anybody there?"
25:35;25:35;"Hey."
25:35;25:43;"I'm lying out of bounds."
25:43;25:46;"With your woman."
25:46;25:49;"Is there anybody there?"
25:49;25:50;"So--"
25:50;25:51;"Hello."
25:51;25:54;"--Jake, we were talking last weekend."
25:54;25:57;"The time that you went to go see the dead and co, to me,"
25:57;26:00;"is just the time crisis gift that keeps on giving."
26:00;26:02;"And I just want to explain to everybody again,"
26:02;26:05;"because at this point, if you're a regular time crisis listener,"
26:05;26:07;"you have to have some cursory familiarity"
26:07;26:08;"with the Grateful Dead."
26:08;26:10;"But just so everybody understands,"
26:10;26:15;"Grateful Dead was a band for almost 30 years."
26:15;26:19;"The leader, kind of main singer, guitar god Jerry Garcia"
26:19;26:21;"died in '95."
26:21;26:24;"Then you had all the other guys kind of doing this and that."
26:24;26:28;"And then the Grateful Dead, the past year,"
26:28;26:30;"has been touring as dead and company"
26:30;26:33;"and doing a fairly big tour where"
26:33;26:36;"it's a few of the original members plus John Mayer"
26:36;26:38;"kind of filling in for Jerry Garcia."
26:38;26:39;"Right."
26:39;26:41;"I feel like for some reason this tour,"
26:41;26:44;"people are talking about it as if it's"
26:44;26:46;"almost like going to see the Grateful Dead or something."
26:46;26:47;"Are they?"
26:47;26:49;"Maybe it's just because of John Mayer."
26:49;26:52;"It's a higher profile than an early 2000s Phil Lesch"
26:52;26:52;"and Friends."
26:52;26:53;"Right."
26:53;26:53;"I mean, yeah."
26:53;26:54;"I mean, since--"
26:54;26:56;"Because they're doing all Grateful Dead songs."
26:56;26:59;"Plus years of their surviving members"
26:59;27:02;"with a rotating cast of other players"
27:02;27:05;"doing different versions of dead spinoff bands."
27:05;27:07;"It just seems like this is being billed as more official."
27:07;27:12;"And then, well, in 2015, there was the 50th anniversary"
27:12;27:12;"of the dead."
27:12;27:14;"They're doing these huge stadium shows."
27:14;27:16;"They had Trey from Phish filling in."
27:16;27:16;"Yeah."
27:16;27:18;"They had John Mayer filling in."
27:18;27:21;"They hosted the three-day festival in Chicago"
27:21;27:25;"called Fare Thee Well, which was like the supposed"
27:25;27:28;"end of the dead, like the whole run."
27:28;27:29;"Bob and Phil were hanging up."
27:29;27:30;"We're done."
27:30;27:32;"It was the 20th anniversary of Jerry's death"
27:32;27:35;"because his last show was at Soldier Field in Chicago."
27:35;27:36;"In '95."
27:36;27:36;"Right."
27:36;27:38;"So this is almost like the post-script."
27:38;27:39;"It's like, you know what, man?"
27:39;27:40;"We can't go out like that."
27:40;27:42;"We had so much fun at those 50th shows."
27:42;27:43;"Well, that's what's lame."
27:43;27:46;"It's like, if you're going to go out, at least do what LCD did"
27:46;27:48;"and take six years off."
27:48;27:48;"Right."
27:48;27:50;"They took one year."
27:50;27:52;"You can't-- I mean, I don't think they even took a year off."
27:52;27:55;"They were out touring like last year."
27:55;27:55;"OK, that's fine."
27:55;27:57;"Phil is no longer touring."
27:57;27:59;"Phil, the bass player, was like, I'm out."
27:59;28:00;"But Bob and--"
28:00;28:04;"Bob, we at least got to take off six years like LCD."
28:04;28:05;"I'm out, man."
28:05;28:09;"If you came to me with LCD model, I might be down, but--"
28:09;28:12;"I'll be 81 at that point."
28:12;28:16;"OK, so anyway, you go to see Dead & Co at Hollywood Bowl."
28:16;28:17;"Right."
28:17;28:18;"John Mayer on guitar."
28:18;28:19;"This was like back in May or June."
28:19;28:20;"This was back in May."
28:20;28:22;"You didn't have a great time."
28:22;28:23;"It was fun to go there with my friends."
28:23;28:26;"We got on the bus in Pasadena at the park and ride."
28:26;28:27;"Yeah."
28:27;28:30;"Snuck on a 12-pack, sitting in the back of the bus."
28:30;28:30;"Sick."
28:30;28:32;"Takes you down the 134."
28:32;28:33;"Modellos?"
28:33;28:34;"Yeah."
28:34;28:35;"OK."
28:35;28:36;"On brand."
28:36;28:38;"The bus takes you to the Hollywood Bowl."
28:38;28:39;"We get out there."
28:39;28:42;"There's like a really crusty lot scene."
28:42;28:43;"Just a buff scene, man."
28:43;28:45;"Yeah."
28:45;28:50;"Just people who are like gone, like with a 1,000 yard stare."
28:50;28:52;"Just weird old hippies selling trinkets."
28:52;28:54;"Yeah, well, that is mellow."
28:54;28:57;"It's more like the people who are in their 30s or their 20s,"
28:57;28:59;"who are like gacked out on something."
28:59;29:01;"And then we get into the venue."
29:01;29:03;"We got great seats."
29:03;29:06;"Paid a small fortune for them."
29:06;29:10;"And I thought the show sucked musically."
29:10;29:15;"And the crowd was just eating it up, drinking the Kool-Aid."
29:15;29:19;"You were one of the only dudes who had the balls to just say--"
29:19;29:20;"Yeah."
29:20;29:21;"OK, so my buddy Chris--"
29:21;29:22;"This is not kind."
29:22;29:23;"This is buff."
29:23;29:25;"My buddy Chris Fallon was with us."
29:25;29:29;"And he shot a little impromptu video, maybe like second song"
29:29;29:30;"in, third song in."
29:30;29:32;"He's like, Jake, first impressions."
29:32;29:35;"And I just kind of like went off,"
29:35;29:40;"and I said that I thought John Mayer was lame and kind"
29:40;29:42;"of tasteless and not really bringing the whole lot."
29:42;29:45;"Pretty generic, like virtuosic guitar playing."
29:45;29:47;"Anyway, Chris posted it to Instagram."
29:47;29:49;"And it went on a local LA level."
29:49;29:50;"It went viral."
29:50;29:52;"Because then two weeks later, I'm"
29:52;29:55;"in the Home Depot in Lincoln Heights."
29:55;29:57;"And this dude comes up to me."
29:57;29:59;"He's like, dude, this sounds so weird."
29:59;30:02;"But straight up, man, I saw you on Instagram yesterday."
30:02;30:04;"My buddy showed me the video."
30:04;30:07;"And it's you just like ripping into John Mayer"
30:07;30:08;"in his performance at the Dead Show."
30:08;30:10;"And I was like, wait, do you know Chris?"
30:10;30:10;"He's like, no."
30:10;30:11;"Who?"
30:11;30:11;"Who's that?"
30:11;30:13;"He's like, no, my buddy just showed me the video."
30:13;30:14;"I'm like, what?"
30:14;30:16;"Wait, didn't you say there was yet another person"
30:16;30:17;"came over to you?"
30:17;30:18;"Yeah, yeah."
30:18;30:21;"And then like a month later, like quite a ways after,"
30:21;30:23;"I was at an art opening."
30:23;30:24;"Now, this guy did know Chris."
30:24;30:26;"But he was like, oh, hey, man."
30:26;30:28;"Like, oh, I loved you on Chris's Instagram"
30:28;30:30;"just tearing into Mayer."
30:30;30:32;"Thought that was just so on point."
30:32;30:34;"I was like, [BLEEP] damn, man."
30:34;30:37;"All right, so we got to play the video in question."
30:37;30:39;"So this is what your buddy Chris posted."
30:39;30:42;"This is Jake ripping into John Mayer."
30:42;30:44;"This was filmed at the Hollywood Bowl concert."
30:44;30:45;"Yeah, three songs in."

31:07;31:08;"The Mayer is brutal."
31:08;31:09;"Bad Mayer."
31:09;31:09;"Bad Mayer."
31:09;31:12;"People are like, they love John Mayer."
31:12;31:13;"It's awful."
31:13;31:15;"It's not working."
31:15;31:17;"If you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, that's fine."
31:17;31:18;"We're made to be seen early."
31:18;31:20;"Only the third song in the set."
31:20;31:22;"None of the lyricism of Jerry."
31:22;31:22;"None of it."
31:22;31:23;"Respect."
31:23;31:24;"No lyricism here."
31:24;31:26;"Not a lot of soul going on."

31:36;31:38;"So also just to paint the picture,"
31:38;31:41;"one thing I like about this video that he posted"
31:41;31:45;"is it starts out, the camera's pointed at the stage."
31:45;31:48;"You see all these older hippies just kind of bobbing"
31:48;31:50;"their heads, having a great time."
31:50;31:53;"Then you pan over to Jake, just looking harshed out."
31:53;31:55;"And then you just start ripping it."
31:55;31:56;"It's just like a real contrast."
31:56;31:59;"Everybody's just kind of hippie dancing, enjoying it."
31:59;32:00;"And I get it."
32:00;32:01;"People are there to have a good time."
32:01;32:04;"You know, people want to have a good time."
32:04;32:06;"I wanted to have a good time, but I'm also not going to"
32:06;32:10;"relinquish all critical thought about it."
32:10;32:14;"You were looking for guitar lyricism."
32:14;32:19;"That's one of the real transcendent and beautiful parts"
32:19;32:23;"about the Dead's music is Jerry's touch on the guitar."
32:23;32:23;"Right."
32:23;32:25;"His tone and his choices."
32:25;32:27;"TTL, tone, touch, and lyricism."
32:27;32:28;"Woo."
32:28;32:30;"That's what makes a good guitarist."
32:30;32:33;"I mean, Jerry was an incredibly unique guitarist."
32:33;32:36;"There's very few really distinct guitarists"
32:36;32:38;"where you're like, oh, that's them playing solo."
32:38;32:40;"So in the video, you said this is cool"
32:40;32:43;"if you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, because you're not a fan of SRV."
32:43;32:44;"Not really."
32:44;32:46;"I mean, I know people are ride or die SRV."
32:46;32:47;"It just sounds like--"
32:47;32:48;"Some fake Jimi Hendrix."
32:48;32:52;"Yeah, it just sounds like a really accomplished bar band,"
32:52;32:55;"like blues, Texas blues."
32:55;32:57;"I like this conversation, because I think it also--"
32:57;32:59;"on the show, we talk so much about the tasteful palate"
32:59;33:01;"of the 1970s."
33:01;33:05;"And I think sometimes people get a twist and say, well,"
33:05;33:08;"is that all you need to make good music in Jake's book?"
33:08;33:10;"All you need is the tasteful palate of '70s stuff?"
33:10;33:14;"No, you also need tone, touch, and lyricism."
33:14;33:15;"You need good songs."
33:15;33:17;"Oh, and good songs."
33:17;33:19;"That's happened before on this show, where we're listening"
33:19;33:22;"to some random top five from the '70s."
33:22;33:23;"And even with that palate."
33:23;33:24;"And you're like, what?"
33:24;33:25;"It's the perfect palate."
33:25;33:25;"You don't like it?"
33:25;33:27;"I'm like, come on, bro."
33:27;33:27;"It doesn't have--"
33:27;33:29;"It's not just the palate."
33:29;33:33;"The band Bread, the band America, great palates."
33:33;33:35;"Bad songs."
33:35;33:38;"I mean, I can get down with a couple of America songs."
33:38;33:41;"And lyricism, tone and touch, TTL."
33:41;33:42;"Good tone."
33:42;33:43;"Good tone."
33:43;33:45;"Decent touch."
33:45;33:48;"Not a lot of lyricism."
33:48;33:52;"I used to have these superhero trading cards"
33:52;33:54;"when I was a kid, like X-Men trading cards."
33:54;33:56;"And I actually learned a lot of words from them,"
33:56;33:57;"because I was probably like eight or nine."
33:57;33:59;"And you'd flip over and be like, Wolverine."
33:59;34:01;"And it'd be like, stamina, nine."
34:01;34:04;"And I just remember this is the first time I've ever--"
34:04;34:04;"Strength."
34:04;34:05;"I've heard the word stamina."
34:05;34:06;"Strength, 10."

34:13;34:14;"Touch."
34:14;34:15;"Lyricism."
34:15;34:18;"So America would be like, tone, nine."

34:19;34:20;"Lyricism, two."
34:20;34:21;"Four."
34:21;34:22;"Yeah."
34:22;34:25;"(SINGING) Well, I tried to make it Sunday,"
34:25;34:33;"but I got so damn depressed that I set my sights on Monday."
34:33;34:36;"And I got myself undressed."
34:36;34:40;"I ain't ready for the altar, but I"
34:40;34:45;"do agree there's times when a woman sure"
34:45;34:48;"can be a friend of mine."
34:48;34:56;"Well, I keep on thinking about you, sister golden hair"
34:56;34:58;"surprise."
34:58;35:01;"And I just can't live without you."
35:01;35:04;"Can't you see it in my eyes?"
35:04;35:08;"I've been one poor, poorest man."
35:08;35:11;"And I've been due too far to find."
35:11;35:16;"But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind."
35:16;35:22;"Will you meet me in the air?"
35:22;35:25;"Will you meet me in the air?"
35:25;35:29;"Will you love me just a little?"
35:29;35:32;"Just enough to show you care?"
35:32;35:35;"Well, I tried to fake it."

35:38;35:41;"Time crisis."
35:41;35:44;"Well, speaking of America, Jake, you"
35:44;35:47;"did some real digging the past week."
35:47;35:51;"And you came across a band that I'd never heard of"
35:51;35:53;"that we need to talk about."
35:53;35:56;"Yeah, Madison Rising."
35:56;35:58;"OK, so Madison Rising bills themselves"
35:58;36:01;"as America's most patriotic rock band."
36:01;36:03;"Yeah, well, a little back story."
36:03;36:04;"Yeah, how did you find them?"
36:04;36:06;"I was reading about the Juggalo March."
36:06;36:07;"Right."
36:07;36:12;"In DC, which obviously that's the most 2017 fascinating thing"
36:12;36:12;"ever."
36:12;36:14;"And for people who have been living"
36:14;36:16;"under a rock for the past 20 years,"
36:16;36:19;"Juggalos are fans of the Insane Clown Posse."
36:19;36:21;"It's bigger than just a fandom, though."
36:21;36:22;"It's kind of a culture and a lifestyle."
36:22;36:25;"The Juggalos have been classified as a gang by the FBI."
36:25;36:28;"So they're marching on DC to kind of fight for their rights"
36:28;36:31;"to explain that they shouldn't be discriminated against."
36:31;36:32;"That is kind of crazy."
36:32;36:35;"I mean, it'd be like saying the Deadheads are a gang."
36:35;36:38;"And there were a lot of sad stories in this long article"
36:38;36:40;"I read on the AV Club about the Juggalo March,"
36:40;36:46;"about people with Juggalo tattoos who then lost custody"
36:46;36:49;"of their kids in a court case because they"
36:49;36:50;"had Juggalo tattoos."
36:50;36:52;"And that's a gang affiliation."
36:52;36:53;"So it's really no joke."
36:53;36:57;"Literally, people's rights are being compromised or straight"
36:57;37:03;"up violated because some judge somewhere in Ohio is like,"
37:03;37:04;"well, sir, as a member of a gang,"
37:04;37:07;"the state cannot permit you to be in your child's life."
37:07;37:09;"OK, so it's really bad."
37:09;37:09;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
37:09;37:10;"That's why they did it."
37:10;37:11;"It wasn't just like a joke."
37:11;37:12;"Yeah."
37:12;37:16;"I mean, it is funny, obviously, the Juggalos marching on DC."
37:16;37:18;"If you zoom out, it's funny."
37:18;37:19;"And I think Juggalos have a sense of humor"
37:19;37:21;"about the fact that they wear face paint and stuff."
37:21;37:22;"But no, you're right."
37:22;37:23;"That's really serious that they're"
37:23;37:25;"being targeted that way."
37:25;37:29;"So there was this big march and then a lot of speakers."
37:29;37:30;"And then a band played--"
37:30;37:31;"well, ICP played."
37:31;37:35;"And then a band called Madison Rising also played."
37:35;37:38;"And I was reading the description of the whole march."
37:38;37:40;"And that name caught my eye."
37:40;37:43;"I was like, who's Madison Rising?"
37:43;37:45;"And then I looked at their Wikipedia page"
37:45;37:50;"and self-described their biggest influence is Creed."
37:50;37:55;"Can you take me higher?"
37:55;37:59;"And it's like Ted Nugent level, quote unquote,"
37:59;38:06;"patriotism with the most guitar center,"
38:06;38:09;"just pathetic, kind of like proto grunge."
38:09;38:12;"It's like a band you would see on The Simpsons,"
38:12;38:14;"except it's real."
38:14;38:16;"It kind of seems like a fake band."
38:16;38:17;"Yeah."
38:17;38:18;"But they had Madison Rising on the bill."
38:18;38:24;"And this is live before the nationwide NASCAR"

38:36;38:39;"That would be Creedence Clearwater Revival."

38:42;38:42;"Most patriotic rock band."
38:42;38:44;"Who do you think-- who is the most patriotic rock band?"

44:37;44:39;"it's just like left wingers, like, you know,"
44:39;44:42;"you like when you know that an artist has"
44:42;44:44;"some shared morality with you."
44:44;44:46;"But if they play too hard, you know,"
44:46;44:49;"even like liberal Bernie bros like us,"
44:49;44:53;"if Pearl Jam came out with a new song that was like,"
44:53;44:56;"we got to support socialism."
44:56;44:59;"Medicare for all."
44:59;45:01;"His name was Bernie Sanders."
45:01;45:03;"We'd just be like, this sucks."
45:03;45:04;"So even I'm sure there's some right wingers who"
45:04;45:05;"love Alice in Chains and Zeppelin."
45:05;45:07;"They're like, OK, you know what?"
45:07;45:08;"A little on the nose, guys."
45:08;45:11;"Yeah, like, I do support the right to bear arms."
45:11;45:12;"But I don't need this."
45:12;45:14;"And also, like, this story, like, they're like,"
45:14;45:19;"it's a story about killing someone in your house."
45:19;45:23;"And it has like the emotional palette of like a hard rock"
45:23;45:25;"song, like a strip club."
45:25;45:25;"Yeah."
45:25;45:28;"Like, it has none of the like resonance"
45:28;45:31;"that it really should, given like how gnarly the subject"
45:31;45:31;"matter is."
45:31;45:35;"Well, I guess to be fair to Madison Rising, in this story,"
45:35;45:37;"he's not actually killing the thief."
45:37;45:39;"Oh, he's just chasing them off?"
45:39;45:39;"I know."
45:39;45:41;"This is also just like the perfect right wing version"
45:41;45:42;"of how gun rights go."
45:42;45:42;"Right."
45:42;45:44;"If you come home, the door is broken in."
45:44;45:45;"Perfect scenario."
45:45;45:47;"Also, he grabbed his piece, went inside"
45:47;45:48;"to see who lurks within."
45:48;45:49;"He sees the thief."
45:49;45:50;"He's face to face with him."
45:50;45:51;"Cocks that .45."
45:51;45:53;"The coward ran away."
45:53;45:54;"It's like a Dirty Harry movie."
45:54;45:58;"Yeah, and then he called the locksmith, fixed the lock,"
45:58;45:59;"slept soundly."
45:59;46:00;"That's that."
46:00;46:01;".45 under the pillow."
46:01;46:04;"I just like want to like a version that's like,"
46:04;46:07;"and then I cocked my .45."
46:07;46:09;"He shot me in the arm."
46:09;46:10;"I thought that I'd die."
46:10;46:12;"He beat the shit out of me."
46:12;46:15;"Like the gun jammed."
46:15;46:20;"Random fire from my piece went into the neighbor's house,"
46:20;46:22;"killing my elderly neighbor."
46:22;46:24;"It's a small price to pay."
46:24;46:27;"I couldn't let that thief get away."
46:27;46:29;"Yeah, like perfect story, man."
46:29;46:34;"All right, well, check out Madison Rising or don't."
46:34;46:38;"America's, I'm going to say, least patriotic rock band."
46:38;46:40;"You want to check out a patriotic rock band,"
46:40;46:43;"check out Bruce."
46:43;46:43;"You know what?"
46:43;46:45;"Honestly, even Led Zeppelin's more patriotic."
46:45;46:49;"I'm going to make a true patriotic playlist."
46:49;46:50;"Oh, I love that."
46:50;46:51;"Yeah."
46:51;46:52;"Jake making a--"
46:52;46:53;"OK, I love that."
46:53;46:56;"I want to see Jake's takes on what it really"
46:56;46:58;"means to be an American rock fan."
46:58;47:03;"Because the right wingers, because rock apparently is dead,"
47:03;47:05;"the liberals don't care about rock anymore."
47:05;47:07;"Because, you know, we don't turn up to rock anymore."
47:07;47:08;"That's true."
47:08;47:12;"It'll be interesting to see what the most recent song"
47:12;47:14;"on the patriotic playlist will be."
47:14;47:15;"Right."
47:15;47:16;"It probably won't be--"
47:16;47:17;"The Shear Mag."
47:17;47:18;"OK, actually, yeah."
47:18;47:19;"Do they have any patriotic songs?"
47:19;47:20;"Oh, yeah, no."
47:20;47:20;"Yeah, yeah."
47:20;47:25;"Their politics are super engaged with kind of lefty engagement."
47:25;47:26;"Yeah, yeah."

01:12:11;01:12:14;"Well, that was quite a whirlwind, Jake."
01:12:14;01:12:15;"Good lord."
01:12:15;01:12:16;"Guy's high energy."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"You gotta be."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I like how he was just like, what is this?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"I don't like it."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"I don't get it."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Do you think he really didn't know who Jerry Garcia is?"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"I guess for an English person, it's possible."
01:12:27;01:12:32;"He seemed like ride or die boy band stuff and like Queen,"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"like maybe like a theater kid."
01:12:34;01:12:34;"Oh, well, yeah."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"He comes from like a musical theater."
01:12:36;01:12:36;"OK, yeah."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"So that makes sense."
01:12:37;01:12:40;"He's like Queen and like some sort of shaggy kind"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"of like loose classic rock stuff."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"It's just like not his aesthetic."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Right."
01:12:45;01:12:49;"James Corden was starting boy bands, belting show tunes."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"He was like an Into the Woods and stuff, doing theater."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"Yeah, Queen is way more appealing and probably"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"like maybe a couple of burnout."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Also, he's like a professional showbiz guy."
01:12:58;01:13:01;"Right, like the Grateful Dead or not."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"He's a triple threat too, by the way."
01:13:04;01:13:04;"Dancing?"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"What?"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"Singing, dancing, acting and hosting."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Does he act and stuff?"
01:13:09;01:13:12;"He was in those Into the Woods movie."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"He's been like on Broadway and stuff."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"I guess it's very possible that like the dead really"
01:13:17;01:13:23;"didn't tour the UK very much after the 70s."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"I don't know."
01:13:24;01:13:24;"Is that true?"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"I mean, yeah, obviously 72."
01:13:26;01:13:26;"I mean, I feel like..."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"I don't know."
01:13:27;01:13:30;"Every American high school, at least through the 90s,"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"would have had some kind of kid who like was into the dead."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Right."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"Maybe not anymore, but you know, James is in his 30s,"
01:13:37;01:13:37;"I think."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"So like if he was American, he'd at least know who Jerry Garcia was."
01:13:41;01:13:41;"Yeah."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"But it's possible you go to the average like 30-something"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"English guy and you're just like, ""Name one member of the Grateful"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"Dead,"" and they'll just be like, ""You might as well be asking"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"about Quicksilver Messenger Service."""
01:13:51;01:13:51;"Right."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"Also clearly didn't know who Boz Gaggs was."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"Who's the drummer in Moby Grape?"
01:13:57;01:13:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Yeah, we don't know that."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"No, I don't know."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"So let's talk about Boz Gaggs a little bit."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Shout out to Jonathan from California."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"Great email."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Great email."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"Great reading of it by James Corden."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"I mean, I'm kind of a fake fan."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"I only know his two big hits."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"Jake, you're the 70s tasteful palate guy."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"What does Boz Gaggs mean to you?"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"I have to admit, it's sort of a blind spot."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"I know Lido Shuffle."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Yeah, that's one of the big hits."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Which is a great song."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"It has kind of like a Billy Joel vibe a little bit."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Yeah."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"I like that song."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"I mean, he's one of those names that I've heard like bandied"
01:14:32;01:14:36;"about for years, and then I would sort of like maybe do a"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"cursory check in with him."
01:14:37;01:14:41;"And yeah, this is like a good, yeah, this song does have a bit"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"of a Billy Joel vibe."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"This is tight."
01:14:49;01:14:54;"I wish our emailer Jonathan had explained more what about it"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"appealed to him so much."
01:14:57;01:15:02;"I'm down with this, but it doesn't like hit me as like"
01:15:02;01:15:09;"incredibly original or unique to Boz, but this is a good song."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Yeah."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"I don't know my Boz."
01:15:11;01:15:16;"Next time, shout out to Leo, put the mic down and let him roll."
01:15:16;01:15:22;"He said, one more job ought to get it."
01:15:22;01:15:25;"One last shot before we quit it."
01:15:25;01:15:31;"One for the road."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"I mean, this should have been on the Humpty Humpty list."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Staying in the day before the night."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"He's worth a shot."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"Staying in the face."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"We are the order."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"This would be cool on a Home Depot ad too."
01:15:47;01:15:47;"Yeah."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"Come on down to Home Depot this weekend."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Yeah."
01:15:50;01:15:54;"20% off on all blah, blah, blah."
01:15:54;01:15:58;"And get your deck looking right for Labor Day."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Actually, this is more like some local."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"Yeah, it's humble."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"Order."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"Come down to Boz Skaggs' House Depot."
01:16:09;01:16:11;"He's running, having great big fun."
01:16:11;01:16:14;"Take out the note."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"He's a good song."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"I wonder where he was based out of."
01:16:18;01:16:24;"So he was Steve Miller's guitar player when Steve Miller was like a Bay Area psych band."
01:16:24;01:16:29;"Yeah, I feel like he's a Sam Fran guy."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"That sounds cool."
01:16:31;01:16:32;"Same album."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"All right, this is a good album."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Silk Degrees, 1976."
01:16:35;01:16:49;"I mean, this is kind of lame on my part, but I think one of the reasons I don't know Boz Skaggs is that he wasn't on classic rock radio rotation when I was a kid."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"He's a little funky too."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Yeah."
01:16:52;01:17:01;"He might have been too funky for East Coast rock radio."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"Right, right."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"He's very form, you know, classical."
01:17:05;01:17:09;"I wonder if he's on like the bridge now or something, you know, like on Sirius."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"Yeah, maybe a little."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"I just don't encounter his music very often."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"I didn't know any of his hits until like later in life."
01:17:17;01:17:20;"It's a good reminder that history is written by the victors."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Right."
01:17:21;01:17:29;"Because just like, you know, living in America, we're told a very specific story of American history."
01:17:29;01:17:35;"We're taught certain lessons about, you know, who was good, who was bad, why our country did certain things."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"And we're getting this very hyper specific version of it."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Trump won and he's great."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Yeah, in 50 years, who knows?"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"People's images get cleaned up or whatever."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"That's the way it works."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"You got to really dig sometimes."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"But also with music history, if you grew up listening to like a certain radio station,"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"although even that's a played out concept for kids today."
01:17:54;01:17:59;"If you just, if you grow up listening to your dad's classic Rock Labor Day playlist"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"and you hear the same 20 songs over and over again, for all you know,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"Boz Skaggs was an insignificant artist."
01:18:04;01:18:08;"You might not know that his album went to number two on the Billboard charts"
01:18:08;01:18:14;"because maybe your dad favored Aerosmith because your dad's from Boston."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"So you're hearing Aerosmith and you're just like, well, Aerosmith is, I mean, they were a big band."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"But I'm just saying like you have a very..."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"AC/DC, you know, yeah, Tom Petty, whatever."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Just like..."
01:18:24;01:18:28;"Well, yeah, it's kind of, even like with, I feel like until I spent, started spending more time in LA,"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"I just really didn't know that many like Tupac songs."
01:18:31;01:18:35;"There's a lot of stuff they play on like on K Day, like the kind of throwback LA rap radio."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Yeah, yeah."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"That you just never, you didn't hear that much on Hot 97 in New York."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"Because obviously New York, it's skewed New York."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Yeah."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"But anyway, some people describe Boss Gags as blue-eyed soul."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Okay."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"I mean, I think of like Hall and Oates that way."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Yeah, well, I guess blue-eyed soul is a big genre."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"It kind of refers to any white person trying to be soulful."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Right."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"It is kind of, yeah, blue-eyed soul."
01:18:55;01:18:58;"There's something like a little sinister about it."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Yeah, I wonder if they meant it that way."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"Because yeah, in like the context of today, it seems a little bit like, eugh."
01:19:04;01:19:07;"Well, blue-eyed makes you think of like Arian or something."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"Right."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"And obviously white people have all sorts of different eyes."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Eye colors."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"I have brown eyes."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"Yeah, I have hazel eyes."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"Just a brown-eyed handsome man."
01:19:16;01:19:24;"I guess blue eyes, even though you find that here and there, to people that connotes Caucasian."
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Yeah."
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Yeah, you couldn't call it brown-eyed soul."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"Whatever."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"I don't know."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"Maybe this is not a politically correct phrase."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"I don't know if people still use it that much."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"Jonathan, your email is really going a long way on the show."
01:19:36;01:19:39;"Just a deep Boss Gags fan email."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"We're going to do the top five right now."
01:19:41;01:19:48;"And today, in tribute to Boss Gags and the year that his album Silk Degrees peaked at number two on the Billboard 200,"
01:19:48;01:19:54;"we're going to compare the top five of 2017 with the top five of 1976."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Silk Degrees."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Our bicentennial year."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"America celebrating 200."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"We got Boss Gags hitting number two."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Number two on the album charts, but let's see."
01:20:04;01:20:11;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:20:11;01:20:18;"We're going to start off with Boss Gags because his other big hit, Lowdown, was number five on the Billboard charts."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"September '76, I Am In Utero."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Really?"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Oh, yeah."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Jake is just kind of taking it all in."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Yep."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"I'm soaking it up."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Just kind of getting ready to enter."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Making my entrance February '77."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Oh, this is Boss Gags?"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"This is also a very funky song."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"Yeah."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"So, Jake, you're--"
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Heavily sampled."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"You're a fetus in your mother's womb."
01:20:39;01:20:46;"You're just kind of starting to, like, hear through the flesh what's going on in America, and you're like,"
01:20:46;01:20:50;"""Man, I really like the tasteful palette of the music that's happening."
01:20:50;01:20:52;"I hope this lasts forever."""
01:20:52;01:20:55;"She's in, like, the frozen food aisle at the Grand Union."
01:20:55;01:20:57;"Yeah."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"You're just kind of like, ""Okay, man."
01:20:58;01:21:00;"I like this tasteful palette."
01:21:00;01:21:06;"If this is what life is going to be like for the next, you know, hundred years, that's cool with me, man."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I'll live a long, happy life."""
01:21:08;01:21:13;"Little did you know in four years, it would be 1980, and the tasteful palette of the '70s would be gone forever."
01:21:13;01:21:18;"Yeah, this is cool."
01:21:31;01:21:35;"Are those flutes?"
01:21:35;01:21:39;"I think so."
01:21:39;01:21:44;"Jeff Porcaro on drums, legendary drummer who played with Michael Jackson, Toto."
01:21:44;01:21:49;"Okay, Michael Jackson, you know, Toto."
01:21:49;01:21:53;"That's a weird lateral move."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"He was in Toto."
01:21:54;01:21:56;"He and his brother founded Toto, the Porcaro bros."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Oh, okay."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"And then the Recession dudes for..."
01:21:59;01:22:03;"I think he was just known as, like, one of the best drummers in L.A. in the '70s and '80s."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"He's played on all sorts of stuff."
01:22:05;01:22:12;"The number five song in 2017, Portugal the Man."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Do you know this band, Jake?"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"No."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"I've read a piece on them."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"They're the talk of the music industry right now."
01:22:19;01:22:24;"This is the first time in a long time that, like, a ""alternative song"" has, like, broken into top 40."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"Right."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"And, wait, sorry, what's the band called?"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"Portugal the Man."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"They're from where?"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"They're from Alaska."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"Wow."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"They're from the same town as Sarah Palin."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Wow."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"How did they get their--I mean..."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Can't you hear that lonesome Alaskan sound?"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"High, lonesome sound?"
01:22:50;01:22:54;"They're kind of shooting themselves in the foot with that name, and they're coming out of Alaska."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"That's, like, steep odds."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Alaska the Man."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"Should've just named the band Alaska."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Oh, wow, you know what's funny?"
01:23:06;01:23:11;"We were listening to this song the other day, and Rashida said this song sounds just like ""Please, Mr. Postman."""
01:23:11;01:23:12;"Oh."
01:23:18;01:23:23;"And now I'm looking at the info about this song, and they credited the people who wrote ""Please, Mr. Postman."""
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Really?"
01:23:24;01:23:29;"You think there's more of that happening now with the Internet and people being more litigious?"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Yeah, people are scared of getting sued."
01:23:31;01:23:37;"And they're, like, they probably just wrote the song, and, like, ""Please, Mr. Postman"" is in their subconscious, like all of us."
01:23:37;01:23:41;"And then someone later was like, ""Dude, that sounds like 'Please, Mr. Postman.' It's the exact same chord progression."""
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Damn."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"This is a good song."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Yeah."
01:23:50;01:23:53;"I caught this on 1260 AM the other day."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"You were just listening to this on AM radio?"
01:23:55;01:24:02;"Yeah, there's an oldie station I found in LA called 1260 AM, and it's all just 50s and 60s."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Wow."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"That's my go-to, like, car radio station."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Oh, did they say that?"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"In his song?"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"1966?"
01:24:18;01:24:21;"Maybe they were very consciously shouting out ""Please, Mr. Postman."""
01:24:21;01:24:25;"The number four song in 1976."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Remember, this is the height of disco."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Right."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"KC and the Sunshine Band, ""Shake, Shake, Shake."""
01:24:38;01:24:39;"You like disco, Jake?"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"Yeah, I'm down with it."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"I mean, it's got the tasteful palette of the 1970s."
01:24:42;01:24:45;"Yeah, I'm not throwing it on a lot, but I'm down with it."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"You're not one of those rock dudes who thinks disco sucks, are you?"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"No, that'd be amazing."
01:24:51;01:24:57;"Just like in 2017 being like, ""I'm a Zeppelin guy. I can't stand disco."""
01:24:57;01:25:00;"Zeppelin, AC/DC, just real straightforward stuff."
01:25:00;01:25:05;"You listen back to this stuff and it's like rock, disco, it's all the same palette, you know?"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"Yeah."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"This is hilarious."

01:25:23;01:25:27;"The full title is ""Shake, Shake, Shake"" in parentheses, then ""Shake Your Booty."""
01:25:27;01:25:31;"So to say it out loud, the full title is ""Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake Your Booty."""
01:25:31;01:25:35;"And this holds the record for being the only song that ever hit number one"
01:25:35;01:25:39;"with a title that has a word repeated more than three times in it."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"They say ""shake"" four times."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Cool."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Someone look that up."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"I mean, what song can you think of that has a word four times in the title?"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Yeah, I know."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"I'm going to take them at their word."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"It was number four this week, but I guess it hit number one eventually."

01:26:17;01:26:19;"Would you call this rock?"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"No."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"I wouldn't call it rock."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Wait, what's that?"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"That's ""Lord."""
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"It's got the same groove."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"That's a tight song."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"Yeah, this is kind of like--"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"That might have been the basis for this."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I'm not suggesting a lawsuit."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"This is the song we're going to have to find the basis."

01:27:10;01:27:11;"Wow."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"Yeah, this is like--I think that 1976 is the year that ""Saturday Night Fever"" came out."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"You know, big year."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"So do you remember this one, ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" by Walter Murphy?"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I don't know."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Or are you familiar with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Is that--"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Yeah, exactly."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"Nobody was trying to listen to that in 1976, so they didn't."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Arguably, you could call this a remix."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Oh, I'm so bored."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"What is this classical bullsh--?"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"It's 1976."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"It's Saturday night."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"We're at the club."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Give me--okay, what's that?"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"Okay, whoa, whoa."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"All right."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"Class--oh, I love this song."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Did your parents have the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"No, no."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"They were checked out by then?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yeah, yeah, they checked out in '71."
01:27:52;01:27:55;"My dad had that, so I'd listen to that occasionally."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"See, this also brings to mind ELO."
01:28:00;01:28:02;"Yeah, the big strings."
01:28:02;01:28:11;"And also this--I mean, I feel like ELO would, like, very consciously try to, like, riff on classical music."
01:28:21;01:28:25;"Pretty cool that there's an instrumental song number three on the charts."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Wait, how long is this?"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Three minutes, four seconds."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"Ooh."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"This part's tight."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"Oh, this is my clav."
01:28:42;01:28:45;"Ooh, get in there."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"Oh, this is sick."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"Yeah, this is great."
01:28:51;01:29:01;"I'd be remiss not to point out--I'm sure some people at home remember--Robin Thicke, before ""Blurred Lines,"" sampled this song."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"Oh, no, is this Beethoven?"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"This is so boring."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Oh."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Is this that song?"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Improved by vocals?"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"What do you say?"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"I don't mind it."
01:29:31;01:29:34;"It's got that tasteful '70s ballad."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"It's kind of funny."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"It's really awkward, but I like it."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"Robin's grandmother was like, ""I really like that one with the Beethoven."""
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Yeah."
01:30:12;01:30:13;"All right, not bad."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"I haven't thought about that song in a minute."
01:30:15;01:30:22;"The number three song on iTunes in 2017 is Cardi B, ""Bodak Yellow."""
01:30:22;01:30:23;"You know this one, Jake?"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"No."
01:30:24;01:30:28;"So I should also point out, this song, I think, is about to go to number one on the charts."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"How do you know?"
01:30:29;01:30:33;"Because people have been talking about it, because if this song goes to number one on the charts,"
01:30:33;01:30:40;"it'll be the first time a female rapper went to number one with no features since Lauryn Hill."
01:30:40;01:30:46;"So it's almost 20 years past without a female rapper having just a solo number one."
01:30:46;01:30:50;"So no big other rapper coming in and doing a verse."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Right, because who knows?"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"Maybe Nicki Minaj had a number, a single, but there was a feature or something."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Right."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"So this would be really big if this goes to number one on Billboard."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"What was the Lauryn Hill song 20 years ago?"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"I don't know, maybe Dua, that thing, probably went to number one."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"Do you know who Cardi B is?"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"No."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"She's from the Bronx."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"She became globally famous for being on a reality show."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Really? What one?"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"I think Love & Hip Hop."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"These bloody shoes."
01:31:26;01:31:27;"Haunting."
01:32:04;01:32:08;"So kind of the main thing that people remember from the song, or like the most quoted line, is the opening line,"
01:32:08;01:32:12;"which I think comes back where she's talking about her shoes and she goes,"

01:32:54;01:32:55;"Really?"
01:32:55;01:33:02;"No, I don't know. I mean, I don't follow fashion or women's shoes."

01:33:44;01:33:48;"So you see red on the bottom of those shoes, it's not going to be Jimmy Choo's."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"So now let's listen to the beginning of the song again."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"What? So like the concept of a red-soled shoe?"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Or what is it exactly that they have the patent on?"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"I'd be curious what the actual language of the patent is."
01:33:58;01:34:02;"Because what if like Reebok was like, here's a new basketball shoe."
01:34:02;01:34:05;"Maybe it's something about a specific type of red sole on a woman's..."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Fancy shoe."
01:34:06;01:34:08;"Stiletto?"
01:34:08;01:34:13;"If the shoe is retailing for more than $500, you cannot..."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Or maybe it's a specific color."

01:34:17;01:34:19;"Yeah, so now we have this new information, so listen to this."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Okay."
01:34:20;01:34:22;"So she's talking about an expensive pair of shoes."
01:34:22;01:34:39;"So she's saying, don't mess with me, I'm wearing very expensive shoes."
01:34:39;01:34:42;"Yeah, but she's kind of turning it around too, because she's not just saying..."
01:34:42;01:34:46;"Well, it starts out, little b****."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"Little b****, you don't f*** with me."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"You couldn't f*** with me if you wanted to."

01:34:51;01:34:52;"Maybe more."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Maybe she got even, she's probably super rich now."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"I paid $950 for these shoes."
01:34:56;01:34:59;"I paid $1250, let's say $1250."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"I paid $1250 for these shoes."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"So she's saying, so not only is she saying like I'm richer than you,"
01:35:04;01:35:07;"you're not even at my level fashion-wise, but I like that."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"It's cool, she says, rather than saying Christian Louboutin, like that'd be so basic,"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"she says, these are red bottoms."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"These are bloody shoes."

01:43:04;01:43:06;"a Taylor Swift and Cardi B mixtape."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"Or, like, a video, like an epic--"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Yeah."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"--expensive-looking music video."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"Or a whole Disney movie."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"See, that would be great for Taylor."
01:43:14;01:43:17;"If she's coming off as too self-serious,"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"and everyone's--"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Right, but--"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"You know, have a little humor about yourself."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Oh, my God, you know what--"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"And be the wicked witch."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"We should do--"
01:43:25;01:43:26;"'Cause, you know, you had the Wizard of Oz"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"is from the '40s or something."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"Yeah."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"Then, in the late '70s, you had The Wiz."
01:43:31;01:43:32;"You ever see that?"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"No."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Oh, The Wiz is crazy."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Okay, okay."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"It's Michael Jackson, Diana Ross is Dorothy."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"Oh, okay."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Quincy Jones did the music."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"It's really cool."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Gotcha."
01:43:41;01:43:45;"So, we're about due for another reimagining of it."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Right."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"So, I think we should do, like, a pop music one"
01:43:49;01:43:52;"where Cardi B is Dorothy,"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"and she has red-bottomed Louboutins"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"that are the slippers."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"Who's the Tin Man?"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"It would be, like, a good Tin Man from modern--"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"Wait, what's the Tin Man?"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"That's the guy--"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Oh, Ed Sheeran can be the lion,"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"the Cardi B lion, maybe."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Yeah, yeah."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"The Tin Man doesn't have a heart, right?"
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Tin Man doesn't have a heart,"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"but he's kind of, like, a sweet guy."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"I don't know."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"Who could be the Tin Man?"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"Shawn Mendes?"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"I don't know."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"I'm just really--"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"Or, like, Tom York."
01:44:17;01:44:18;"Okay."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Okay, I was thinking a little more from the pop sphere."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"Go broad."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"Yeah, sure."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"Well, he's, like, you know."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"No, he loves to have a laugh about himself."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"He'd be down."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"Yeah, he's perfect for that."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Or maybe Bruno is in there somewhere."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Oh, Bruno would be great."
01:44:29;01:44:31;"Yeah, Bruno could be the scarecrow."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"So, you have Tom, York, and Bruno."

01:53:25;01:53:26;"This is like a decent haul."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"This is a healthy haul. - Healthy haul."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"So Taylor, I remember last week, had two in the top five."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"- Yeah, the other one did not stick around in the top five on iTunes."
01:53:34;01:53:37;"- Was the other one that was based on the Right Said Fred one?"
01:53:37;01:53:40;"Or was that-- - No, this is the one that's based on the Right Said Fred."

01:54:06;01:54:08;"- Maybe she--yeah, I guess Taylor Swift,"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"one of the biggest artists in the world, people are gonna come for you, but come on."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"- That's pushing it. - And I guess also,"

01:54:16;01:54:18;"- Yeah, there's like phone rings, ""Hello?"""

01:54:20;01:54:23;"- If I remotely knew somebody, and say there's a Vampire Weekend song"
01:54:23;01:54:26;"that had, like, a rhythm, and they played me that,"

01:54:30;01:54:32;"but I'd be like, ""Come on."" - Yeah."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"- ""Well, whatever. It's good for breaking up."""
01:54:34;01:54:37;"- I mean, do you think that her lawyer's calling Right Said Fred"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"and he's just like, ""Here's some free money."""
01:54:39;01:54:41;"- Yeah. - And they're just like, ""Okay."""

01:54:47;01:54:49;"Covered a lot of ground. - Yeah, man."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"- It was a fun little James Corden drop-in."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"Congratulations on your nuptials."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- They were great."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"- We think."
01:54:59;01:55:01;"- Yeah. - When you say--"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"nuptials means you got married."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Has anybody congratulated you on your nuptials"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"before you got married?"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"Has the word ""nuptials"" come up much?"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"- Nuptials not come up."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"Not doing a prenup."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"- No prenup? - No prenup."
01:55:15;01:55:18;"- Well, just remember, if she-- - Whoo!"
01:55:18;01:55:21;"- If she get one of your kids, you're on the hook for 18 years."
01:55:21;01:55:24;"[laughter]"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"- Show just took a..."
01:55:26;01:55:29;"unexpectedly emotional turn. - 18 years."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Wow."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"- Oh, no, nuptial did not come up."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"- But nuptial-- - As a term."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"I don't like that. It's not a good word."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"- It's a funny word. - Yeah. It's kind of gross."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"- Is there a singular of nuptials?"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"- Nuptial? - In a marriage,"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"the two parties each have one nuptial."
01:55:46;01:55:49;"And when they come together to be a unit..."
01:55:49;01:55:52;"- It's a pair of nuptials. - They get a pair of nuptials."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"When the child is born,"
01:55:54;01:55:58;"at random, the child receives one of the nuptials,"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"giving them one nuptial to take in life"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"until they find their partner."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"[sniffles]"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"And that's our show, everybody."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:56:06;01:56:10;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"Be-be-be-be-be-beats..."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"One."
