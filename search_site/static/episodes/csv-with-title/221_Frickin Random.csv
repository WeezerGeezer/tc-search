00:00;00:03;"Today, on Time Crisis,"
00:03;00:06;"Ezra Spohn just died in a hotel room in Chicago,"
00:06;00:08;"so I'm doing the intro."
00:08;00:11;"Seinfeld takes to Twitter to take a poll of"
00:11;00:14;"the listenership on what bands we should discuss."
00:14;00:15;"We get into King,"
00:15;00:17;"Gizzard, and the Lizard Wizard."
00:17;00:18;"We get into Weezer."
00:18;00:20;"We get into Built to Spill."
00:20;00:23;"We get into Ween."
00:23;00:25;"We get into the Rolling Stones on"
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis back again."
01:20;01:23;"Still in the middle of the summer."
01:23;01:27;"Amazingly, we haven't missed an episode."
01:27;01:31;"I don't know if we deserve a pat on the back for that."
01:31;01:34;">> I think you do because you're the one out on the road."
01:34;01:35;">> That's true."
01:35;01:36;">> You're making this work. You're doing this from"
01:36;01:38;"a hotel room in Chicago."
01:38;01:39;"You're about to hop on a bus."
01:39;01:41;">> I'm all over the place."
01:41;01:42;"When I'm not on tour with the band,"
01:42;01:44;"I'm on tour with the family."
01:44;01:45;"That's often how it goes."
01:45;01:47;">> You know where your bread is buttered."
01:47;01:50;">> That's right. It all comes back to TC."
01:50;01:54;"I should also point out that now being back on the road,"
01:54;01:58;"there's always a TC presence at the Vampire shows."
01:58;01:59;">> Love to hear it."
01:59;02:00;">> I told you guys at one show,"
02:00;02:05;"somebody like the entire show in Colorado was holding a sign,"
02:05;02:06;"like a pretty big sign that said,"
02:06;02:08;"""I'm missing Time Crisis for this."""
02:08;02:11;"Every time I'd look up, it'd just be like up."
02:11;02:15;"Then I see people with two people"
02:15;02:17;"riding the rail at a recent show."
02:17;02:20;"They're wearing some homemade Time Crisis."
02:20;02:22;"I think it was like Time Crisis bucket hats."
02:22;02:23;"They're matching."
02:23;02:24;">> It's always there."
02:24;02:26;">> It answers the age-old question."
02:26;02:29;"Is there anybody who's a fan of Time Crisis and Vampire Weekend?"
02:29;02:29;"There's a few."
02:29;02:31;">> Little bit of crossover."
02:31;02:32;">> There is some crossover."
02:32;02:36;"We famously have the TC heads who don't fuck with Vampire,"
02:36;02:39;"and then we have the Vampire heads who don't fuck with TC,"
02:39;02:41;"but then there's the people who have a little bit of both."
02:41;02:43;">> Speaking of our fans,"
02:43;02:44;"that's a good setup for this episode."
02:44;02:45;">> Yeah."
02:45;02:47;">> Because if we wondered if we had any fans,"
02:47;02:54;"Seinfeld did just ask a question to the TwitterX community."
02:54;02:57;"Have we lost Seinfeld? Is he gone?"
02:57;03:00;">> He did his part. He asked the question and now he's vanished."
03:00;03:02;">> Well, he asked,"
03:02;03:04;"""Who would our fans like us to talk about?"
03:04;03:07;"What bands? What music?"""
03:07;03:09;"We didn't know if we'd get any responses."
03:09;03:13;"So far within the last few minutes, what did they say?"
03:13;03:15;"We've gotten hundreds of responses."
03:15;03:16;">> A lot."
03:16;03:18;">> People want us to do some deep dives."
03:18;03:22;"So it sounds like from a quick perusal,"
03:22;03:25;"one of the bands that people are asking us to do a deep dive on,"
03:25;03:28;"is King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard,"
03:28;03:31;"which I think it's impossible to do a deep dive on."
03:31;03:34;"It's too deep. You need a whole show."
03:34;03:36;"I don't mean like an episode of a show,"
03:36;03:37;"I mean you need a whole show."
03:37;03:40;"That's what the show is about, to go deep on them."
03:40;03:42;"But it does raise the interesting question,"
03:42;03:44;"which is we always like to ask on this show."
03:44;03:47;"Jake, do you know what that is?"
03:47;03:50;">> I'm aware. I have not heard a note."
03:50;03:52;"So this is exciting. Seinfeld, are you back?"
03:52;03:53;">> Can you hear me?"
03:53;03:53;">> Yeah."
03:53;03:55;">> Yeah. Okay. All right."
03:55;03:58;"My mic is bugging out. What was the question?"
03:58;04:01;">> It was, ""Does Jake know who King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are?"""
04:01;04:02;">> I do."
04:02;04:03;">> He does. He does."
04:03;04:04;">> I have a vague sense."
04:04;04:09;"Are they part of the jam world or is it a little more like indie, more indie jam?"
04:09;04:11;">> Well, that's a great question because there's"
04:11;04:13;"definitely some crossover."
04:13;04:15;"They're not a jam band, I believe,"
04:15;04:17;"in the sense that they jam,"
04:17;04:21;"but they're definitely doing something incredibly unique."
04:21;04:24;"I was just at a fish show on one of our days off."
04:24;04:30;"Me and CT drove up to Alpine Valley in Wisconsin and went to the fish show."
04:30;04:31;">> Tight."
04:31;04:34;">> Of course, part of being at a fish show is"
04:34;04:37;"the checking out what T-shirts people are wearing,"
04:37;04:39;"checking out the heads."
04:39;04:47;"I did clock a young hippie dude wearing a bright yellow King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard shirt."
04:47;04:50;"It wasn't like, I could tell he was a real hybrid character."
04:50;04:52;"It's not like, because the fish shows,"
04:52;04:53;"there's so many people."
04:53;04:56;"Of course, you could just see a dude in a polo shirt."
04:56;04:57;"You could see an indie looking guy."
04:57;05:01;"But this guy was definitely a hippie type dude."
05:01;05:04;"His pants were very hippie-ish."
05:04;05:08;"They had a kind of wookish volume to them."
05:08;05:13;"He was wearing the Birkenstocks,"
05:13;05:15;"they're the covered Birkenstocks."
05:15;05:16;"You know what I mean?"
05:16;05:17;">> I don't."
05:17;05:19;">> The little slippers."
05:19;05:19;">> Okay."
05:19;05:20;">> Sure."
05:20;05:24;">> Because at this point, I think the classic Birkenstock sandal is so mainstream."
05:24;05:25;"Yeah, Matt's holding it up."
05:25;05:26;">> Okay. Got it."
05:26;05:27;">> You see that, Jake?"
05:27;05:28;">> Got it."
05:28;05:28;">> You know that one."
05:28;05:29;">> Classy looking."
05:29;05:33;">> Everybody wears the classic two-strap Birkenstock."
05:33;05:39;"But I think those ones on a 20-something dude still read extremely hippie-ish."
05:39;05:43;"So anyway, I'm just saying this guy was not like a little hipster dude who also likes fish."
05:43;05:47;"This guy definitely looked the part of a young fish fan,"
05:47;05:49;"but he was wearing a King Gizzard shirt."
05:49;05:52;"So there's definitely some crossover."
05:52;05:54;"I just want to, before we get into King Gizzard,"
05:54;05:57;"I just want to point out something that I just realized."
05:57;06:02;"At this point, I think I've been to four or five fish shows."
06:02;06:05;"So not a lot by a fish fan standards."
06:05;06:08;"One of them, I went to with you guys at the Hollywood Bowl."
06:08;06:09;">> Right."
06:09;06:14;">> In set one, I'm standing over the CT and they go into the song Divided Sky,"
06:14;06:15;"which you might remember, Jake,"
06:15;06:17;"when we were playing you some early fish."
06:17;06:18;"We played you this really long,"
06:18;06:21;"mostly instrumental one with these really pretty guitar lines."
06:21;06:25;"You were into it and you're picturing them in Burlington in the '80s,"
06:25;06:28;"just doing this long, highly composed song."
06:28;06:31;">> Yeah. It's on one of their early records, right?"
06:31;06:34;">> Yeah. So CT was like, ""Have you ever caught this live?"""
06:34;06:36;"When they started playing it and I realized, ""Yeah, I have."""
06:36;06:39;"Anyway, this might not be that interesting to people,"
06:39;06:43;"but I just realized I've seen three fish shows in the past two years,"
06:43;06:46;"and they played Divided Sky at every single show,"
06:46;06:48;"which is highly unusual."
06:48;06:50;"If I had to crunch the numbers on that,"
06:50;06:52;"it's a very low percentage chance."
06:52;06:54;"One of them was with you guys at the Hollywood Bowl."
06:54;06:59;"One of them was at the Garden in the Summer with Rashida and Dev Hines,"
06:59;07:00;"and then at Alpine Valley."
07:00;07:04;"Just statistically, it's very unusual that I've happened to"
07:04;07:09;"catch that song at every show that I've been to in the past two years."
07:09;07:11;"It's a real treat. I really enjoy that one."
07:11;07:13;"Particularly, it was very beautiful."
07:13;07:16;"When the sun just starting to set in"
07:16;07:19;"this beautiful setting in the countryside of Wisconsin."
08:57;08:59;"Is it possible they're doing this just for you?"
08:59;09:02;"No, I don't think they would have known."
09:02;09:05;"Well, I just have some divided sky."
09:05;09:06;"Blast, man."
09:06;09:07;"I might just be blessed."
09:07;09:10;"All right. Ezra, how familiar with this band are you?"
09:10;09:11;"King?"
09:11;09:13;"King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard."
09:13;09:13;"Hell of a name."
09:13;09:18;"Well, they're the type of band where I know what I don't know."
09:18;09:20;"There's for me-"
09:20;09:21;"There's known unknowns."
09:21;09:23;"There's a lot of known unknowns,"
09:23;09:27;"which is all to say that some people know very little about that band."
09:27;09:30;"I know the shape of that band,"
09:30;09:32;"but because they have so much material,"
09:32;09:35;"I can't claim to be super versed in it."
09:35;09:38;"But I've always been hearing about them for years."
09:38;09:40;"I feel like once a year,"
09:40;09:43;"I go listen to a bunch of King Gizzard songs."
09:43;09:45;"I'd love to see them live."
09:45;09:47;"I've always been fascinated by them."
09:47;09:50;"But by the standard of their fans,"
09:50;09:52;"I know nothing, but I know what I don't know."
09:52;09:55;"For instance, literally just a couple of weeks ago,"
09:55;09:56;"I saw they had some new music."
09:56;09:58;"If I ever see they have new music,"
09:58;09:59;"I always listen to it."
09:59;10:02;"I was watching the video for a single they dropped."
10:02;10:06;"Then I started thinking about King Gizzard again and reading about them."
10:06;10:12;"The thing that is so unbelievable about them is that they've released,"
10:12;10:16;"I believe at the time of recording, 26 albums."
10:16;10:19;"One year, I think they did five albums."
10:19;10:22;"You listen to the albums and they're always"
10:22;10:25;"sound pretty cool like they sound like"
10:25;10:29;"a band that might only release an album every three years made it."
10:29;10:31;"They tour all the time."
10:31;10:33;"I don't understand the energy."
10:33;10:36;"You look at their set lists and they're not a jam band."
10:36;10:37;"So it's not like, okay,"
10:37;10:39;"they play a song and they'd take it on a ride and"
10:39;10:42;"just take it into new territory for 40 minutes."
10:42;10:45;"The set lists are always different because they have"
10:45;10:47;"this massive catalog and they're switching it up."
10:47;10:51;"So just that alone is an unbelievable achievement"
10:51;10:54;"and very fascinating about that band."
10:54;10:55;"You got to respect it."
10:55;10:57;"That idea of just like,"
10:57;10:59;"let's just make so much music,"
10:59;11:02;"but always have a thematic element to what we're doing."
11:02;11:04;"Always give our all."
11:04;11:07;"They go hard. So that's the main thing I know about them."
11:07;11:10;"Then I've heard enough music that I feel like I have a sense"
11:10;11:13;"of what they sound like,"
11:13;11:18;"but their whole thing is that different albums will have a different theme or a different genre."
11:18;11:19;"So it can be all over the place."
11:19;11:22;"I mean, we could start just randomly"
11:22;11:23;"just because they just released some new music."
11:23;11:25;"We could throw on one of the new singles."
11:25;11:26;"Do it."
11:26;11:32;"Maybe throw on that one that's called like B-2471 or something."
11:32;11:33;"That was the last one that I heard."
11:33;11:37;"B-741."
11:37;11:52;"Is it sort of like oxygen or something?"
11:52;11:53;"Is that like a condom?"
11:53;11:55;"This song's called Hot Condom Contest."

18:24;18:27;"through the laptop, with us recording the episode,"
18:27;18:28;"so it's hard to, like--"
18:28;18:32;"or maybe it's just the fidelity of, like, the lo-fi recording."
18:32;18:41;"I'm trying to get a handle on like the vocal sound but... Right."
20:23;20:25;"I don't know exactly what I'm hearing."
20:25;20:32;"I mean I think we yeah it's hard to take it all and we can move on. I mean I feel like we should all go see a show."
20:32;20:34;"What do they play if they come through LA?"
20:34;20:37;"Well they're big I think they play the Hollywood Bowl."
20:37;20:38;"No, really?"
20:38;20:39;"That's awesome."
20:39;20:40;"Not like the Fonda?"
20:40;20:41;"No, they're..."
20:41;20:42;"Maybe 10 years ago bro."
20:42;20:49;"Yeah man, this is 2024 King is. I mean I know they're like multiple nights at Red Rocks."
20:49;20:52;"Yeah no I think their last LA show was the Hollywood Bowl."
20:52;20:55;"I was gonna say you know what else I thought of was I'm blanking on their name."
20:55;20:59;"Like who's the band that you went with your son to see at the Palladium?"
20:59;21:01;"The 100 Ghecks."
21:01;21:07;"Yeah, just like hyperactive, up-tempo, short attention span economy."
21:07;21:10;"Let's collage this."
21:10;21:13;"Reminding me of like Wien too. Like 100 Ghecks."
21:13;21:15;"Like there seems like they're trying on."
21:15;21:17;"There's a sense of playfulness and humor."
21:17;21:18;"Yeah."
21:18;21:22;"But similar to Wien it's like serious muso dudes who can shred."
21:22;21:23;"Yeah."
21:23;21:26;"Like music school types but with a sense of playfulness and humor."
21:26;21:29;"I just got a good idea."
21:29;21:32;"How about this for a tour? 100 Ghis."
21:32;21:33;"Oh."
21:33;21:36;"100 Ghecks and King Ghis are co-headline."
21:36;21:40;"I'm gonna do it under my new company Ezra Koenig Productions."
21:40;21:43;"We'll put up the money. I think that's a strong tour."
21:43;21:45;"We're gonna be doing some big rooms."
21:45;21:49;"We might even be doing some baseball stadiums in certain markets."
21:49;21:51;"I think that'll f*cking explode."
21:51;21:53;"And I'm willing to put up some cash on it."
21:53;21:54;"I'm in."
21:54;21:55;"I love it."
21:55;21:57;"Who else is on that tour?"
21:57;21:58;"That's it. I mean maybe we get."
21:58;22:01;"Okay, it's just a co-headline tour not a festival."
22:01;22:04;"It's like a Wu-Tang Rage Against the Machine thing."
22:04;22:05;"You know?"
22:05;22:10;"Maybe we get like an alternative comedian to open on the bill."
22:10;22:14;"Give him 500 bucks a night and room and board just to warm the crowd up."
22:14;22:16;"But it's the 100 Ghis tour."
22:16;22:17;"Or King Ghecks."
22:17;22:19;"Yeah, I was gonna say King Ghecks."
22:19;22:20;"Maybe King Ghecks."
22:20;22:22;"They're making both shirts."
22:22;22:25;"I mean merch wise we're doing all the combos."
23:04;23:05;"Yeah, it sounds cool."
23:05;23:11;"It sounds like a little too frenetic and like Wowie Zowie for where I'm at in my life right now."
23:11;23:16;"But I would love to say that I'm gonna like dive back in and like do the homework on King Ghis."
23:16;23:18;"But you don't see it happening."
23:18;23:19;"I don't know."
23:19;23:20;"I'm too mellow."
23:20;23:23;"I feel like Jake at a King Ghis show is the way."
23:23;23:24;"Yeah."
23:24;23:26;"Do you think they have any ambient stuff?"
23:26;23:28;"Wait, is there a King Ghis-ered ballad?"
23:28;23:30;"I would love to hear a ballad."
23:30;23:32;"That's where I'm hoping like Wien."
23:32;23:34;"Wien will have those gorgeous ballads."
23:34;23:36;"They give the band kind of gravitas."
23:36;23:38;"I want to hear a King Ghis."
23:38;23:43;"God, I mean King Ghis fans probably listen to this being like, Oh my God, there's 23."
23:43;23:46;"Is someone Googling King Ghis-ered ballad?"
23:46;23:48;"They're definitely not all frenetic."
23:48;23:50;"Yeah, but like is there like an it's gonna be or anything?"
23:50;23:52;"Like is there just something?"
23:52;23:55;"The answer is I can see it with my third eye."
23:55;23:57;"The answer is yes."
23:57;24:00;"But I don't know which of the 26 albums it's on."
24:00;24:04;"I've definitely listened to stuff and I was like, Oh, this is more mellow."
24:04;24:13;"We listened to two songs and we're like, this band is too crazy."
24:13;24:14;"No."
24:14;24:22;"But what's interesting is, do King Ghis fans just sort of not appreciate someone at our stage?"
24:22;24:24;"Is it just too deep?"
24:24;24:26;"Is the pool too deep to dive in?"
24:26;24:27;"No, man."
24:27;24:28;"It's up to you."
24:28;24:35;"I don't know like the tone of the fan community, but it's interesting how they have this slight jam crossover because having not seen a show,"
24:35;24:40;"I can't say if the show has the feel of like going to see fish."
24:40;24:45;"But I think what they're doing with records is what jam bands do with their live shows."
24:45;24:47;"You know what I mean?"
24:47;24:56;"Like they're taking, which I've never, I mean, I guess there's other people who are like super prolific, like bedroom pop, like R. Stevie Moore type people."
24:56;24:59;"People who just like build and build in the catalog."
24:59;25:02;"But in a weird way, they're taking a jam ethos."
25:02;25:07;"I don't know if this is how they think of it, but they're taking a jam ethos and applying it to recording."
25:07;25:13;"And maybe also kind of like putting it back on, bringing it to the live show as well."
25:13;25:17;"But they, oh, there's also one, this is a very interesting element of what they do."
25:17;25:20;"I might have this a little bit wrong, but I was talking with somebody."
25:20;25:28;"They're not signed to like a traditional record deal, nor did they self-release in the familiar kind of independent artist way."
25:28;25:33;"What they do, and maybe this is only for some stuff, maybe it's only for live albums."
25:33;25:43;"They'll like release the files and encourage like small labels, you know, like a cassette label in Cincinnati to do limited batch runs."
25:43;25:44;"Bizarre."
25:44;25:47;"Like with their own, and like, I guess that like you're allowed to make your own art."
25:47;25:56;"I don't know if they set a limit, but they're like, hey, if you have like a small, if you want to print up like 300 vinyl of this and distribute it and sell it yourself, go for
it."
25:56;25:58;"So that's kind of a jammy thing."
25:58;26:06;"But again, it's like taking the jam ethos into the studio and like still creating recordings, but at a pace."
26:06;26:08;"That is very bizarre."
26:08;26:09;"Wow."
26:09;26:18;"So they, I mean, so obviously, yeah, there's like zero quality control on the pressing the records and that's fine."
26:18;26:27;"I guess they give you more time to do other recording if you're not dealing with like all of the like annoying office keeping of putting out vinyl."
26:27;26:28;"Right."
26:28;26:29;"One less thing to worry about."
26:29;26:32;"I mean, and it's certainly working like they're really a beloved band."
26:32;26:39;"I find it very inspiring, but I just, these guys just must be so high energy."
26:39;26:41;"Plus they're from Australia."
26:41;26:42;"Did you hear what I said?"
26:42;26:43;"They're from Australia."
26:43;26:44;"Yeah."
26:44;26:49;"I mean, there's that too, but they're from Australia."
26:49;26:50;"They did."
26:50;26:53;"They did all that, but they're from Australia."
26:53;27:07;"But just meaning that they, obviously they record so much and they tour so much and to come toward the US or Europe or something, when you live in Australia, everywhere
you go outside the country, long ass flight, you know?"
27:07;27:08;"Yeah."
27:08;27:12;"There's times where I've just, we've done a tour in Australia and I was like, I want to take two months off."
27:12;27:13;"All the flying and ****."
27:13;27:14;"Brutal."
27:14;27:17;"Getting over there, feeling all turned around."
27:17;27:19;"I was like so burnt afterwards."
27:19;27:22;"So these must be incredibly high energy people."
27:22;27:25;"I'm a very low energy person, so I admire it."
27:25;27:28;"I don't relate, but it's unbelievable."
27:28;27:29;"Yeah."
27:29;27:33;"In the little bit of their music I heard, I was like, these guys are spazzes."
27:33;27:35;"Their passion is not chilling."
27:35;27:36;"No."
27:36;27:37;"Respect."
27:37;27:41;"I just tweeted, is there a King Gizzard ballad?"
27:41;27:42;"You found a Gizzard ballad?"
27:42;27:44;"Well, no, I just tweeted to ask that."
27:44;27:47;"So if I get a response, we can circle back."
27:47;27:50;"A Gizzard ballad is known as a blizzard."
27:50;27:53;"[Laughter]"
27:53;27:59;"There's, all told, there are 17 and a half of them in the catalog."
27:59;28:06;"I do want to call out Jake and then no shade to you, but it's a bit of a spoiler now."
28:06;28:12;"Because, you know, on the Time Crisis Twitter, you've got hundreds of options."
28:12;28:14;"And then if people are connecting the dots."
28:14;28:15;"Oh, I don't care."
28:15;28:16;"Okay."
28:16;28:17;"Like what?"
28:17;28:22;"Like, there's a, they're going to, oh my God, they talked about King Gizzard on the next Time Crisis."
28:22;28:24;"Holy cow."
28:24;28:26;"Yeah, I guess you're right."
28:26;28:28;"Yeah, that's fair."
28:28;28:38;"I could go on and I could just be like, hey, just so you know, Jake's tweet has nothing to do with the thing that I tweeted about a few minutes ago."
28:38;28:41;"That wouldn't be suspicious at all."
28:41;28:42;"[Laughter]"
28:42;28:50;"Okay, guys, according to chat GPT, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have explored a wide range of musical genres."
28:50;28:53;"And they do have songs that could be considered ballads."
28:53;28:59;"One notable example is Sense from their 2015 album, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon."
28:59;29:07;"This song is characterized by its mellow acoustic driven sound and introspective lyrics, which set apart from their more experimental heavy tracks."
29:07;29:08;"So let's listen to that."
29:08;29:12;"Paper Mâché Dream Balloon."
29:12;29:14;"Ladies and gentlemen, we found a blizzard."
29:25;29:34;"It's in vogue to be fair class when it comes to the mother taking care of eggs."
29:34;29:43;"I know it's so conventional, but it don't make no sense at all."
29:43;29:48;"But in fact, it's a pattern."
29:48;29:53;"Everything I hear will always make me action."
29:53;30:02;"I know it's recognizable, but it don't make no sense at all."
30:02;30:09;"No, no, no sense at all."
30:14;30:16;"Like numero group soul vibes."
30:16;30:17;"Yeah."
30:20;30:22;"So what do you think of your first blizzard, Jake?"
30:28;30:29;"I like it."
30:29;30:30;"I'm down."
30:30;30:32;"Still a little off tempo for my taste."
30:32;30:37;"Jake did get a response for a blizzard called Work This Time."
30:37;30:38;"Okay."
30:38;30:42;"Let's check out Work This Time by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard."
31:16;31:17;"Slow enough for you?"
31:21;31:23;"Those fills are a little too high for it."
31:44;31:52;"One thing I can say about this band, having probably heard like 4% of their output,"
31:52;31:56;"it's always pretty tasteful."
31:56;32:01;"Like I feel like the palette is always like a Jake type palette."
32:06;32:09;"Like kind of warm, warm analog sounds."
32:09;32:10;"Yeah."
32:39;32:43;"Matt pointed out that Jake has the exact opposite issue with King Gizzard"
32:43;32:45;"than he does with Zach Bryan."
32:45;32:56;"He needs that up tempo barn burner from my boy ZB that he needs KG to slow it down."
32:56;32:58;"Goldilocks scenario."
33:02;33:04;"I mean that's a lane right there."
33:04;33:09;"Is the band that takes a little bit Zach Bryan, a little bit King Gizz."
33:09;33:12;"Ooh, that's wide open folks."
33:12;33:14;"God, that's another $100,000 idea."
33:17;33:24;"We go find some dudes from Oklahoma and we create kind of like a new school southern rock band"
33:24;33:29;"that has like the palette of King Gizz and we force them to put out five albums a year."
33:29;33:30;"Force."
33:30;33:35;"And we call like Oklahoma dudes so all the music has like, you know, Oklahoma type references."
33:35;33:37;"That would crush."
33:37;33:41;"Yeah, we're doing arenas by 26, I think."
34:05;34:13;"I mean to me it's like great band but are you at a phase in your life where you're ready to invest?"
34:13;34:17;"You know, I feel like 24-year-old Jake, big fan."
34:17;34:19;"That could be true."
34:19;34:21;"I can get behind this."
34:54;34:58;"Wait Jake, were you into the Cindy Lee album?"
34:58;35:00;"Oh yeah, I like that record."
35:00;35:04;"I haven't like gone back to it the last two months or something but."
35:04;35:08;"Weren't you talking a lot about it?"
35:08;35:12;"I'm talking a lot about it but I definitely listened to it a bunch on YouTube."
35:12;35:14;"You like, you listened to the whole album?"
35:14;35:15;"Yeah."
35:15;35:16;"For like two and a half hours?"
35:16;35:17;"I think, yeah, I think it's two hours."
35:17;35:19;"Yeah, I like that record a lot actually."
35:19;35:23;"I think there's some crossover, some King Giz, Cindy Lee crossover."
35:23;35:25;"They're like mining similar territory."
35:25;35:33;"Yeah, yeah, Cindy Lee is a little bit more like, I don't know, weird kind of David Lynch 50s thing."
35:33;35:42;"Well, if any TC heads who are also King Giz heads want to make us an intro playlist, go for it."
35:42;35:44;"Make sure there's some blizzards on there."
35:44;35:51;"Yeah, or you could do an oops all blizzards playlist for Jake."
35:51;35:56;"Just remember, Jake is a 47 year old man, correct?"
35:56;35:57;"Yeah."
35:57;35:59;"He's a 47 year old man."
35:59;36:03;"I mean, he's heard enough uptempo sh*t in his life."
36:03;36:09;"I've heard enough, yeah, kind of frenetic post Zappa riff rock before, so."
36:09;36:14;"All right, gang, he is the client. He is his profile."
36:14;36:21;"He's a 47 year old man, painter, internet personality, based in Los Angeles."
36:21;36:28;"He finds Zach Brian a bit too mellow, but doesn't love the uptempo Giz stuff."
36:28;36:35;"What we're going to do is create a playlist that suits him and his life."
36:35;36:43;"I don't even know what this character is. This is like, it's an Australian reality show."
36:43;36:55;"It's like a renovations show, but it's just like, each episode is an hour, but it's just about making a playlist for a dude."
36:55;36:56;"I like that."
36:56;37:03;"It's like Queer Eye, except it's just Zoomers making playlists for Gen X dudes."
37:03;37:05;"Oh, it's Gen X guys."
37:05;37:07;"Oh my God."
37:07;37:14;"Now, growing up, Jake loved pavement and ween, so I think there's a way in."
37:14;37:19;"That was a shallow dive. Is there anybody that we could actually do a deep dive on?"
37:19;37:22;"I feel like we didn't do like that band Justice, but that's okay."
37:22;37:24;"We're trying out a different format."
37:24;37:28;"I threw some names out here on the list."
37:28;37:36;"Sufjan, Stevens, The Doors, Backween, who I feel like we've talked about on the show."
37:36;37:37;"Yes."
37:37;37:42;"Let's see, Smashing Pumpkins, Fountains of Wayne, Traveling Mulberries."
37:42;37:43;"Okay."
37:43;37:54;"I mean, if we actually want to do a deep dive, the only one that I think we could actually truly do a deep dive on is The Doors, which I'm not against."
37:54;37:55;"But are you ready?"
37:55;37:59;"Have The Doors come up on the show? I feel like The Doors have come up."
37:59;38:01;"They've come up plenty over the years."
38:01;38:05;"I think Jim Morrison as an idea has come up more than The Doors music has really come up."
38:05;38:09;"You may have a collective deep dive if you did a super cut of all The Doors."
38:09;38:16;"Yeah, we've gone deep. I mean, I've been saying for years that I think The Doors should be cool again."
38:16;38:20;"Matt's saying we straight up did an episode that was a Doors deep dive."
38:20;38:23;"I called The Doors deep dive, so I don't know."
38:23;38:26;"You know what's funny? I'm seeing a lot of Weezer on here."
38:26;38:31;"I'm curious about that. Jake, what's your relationship with Weezer?"
38:31;38:38;"I love the first two albums and all the B-sides. And then I tap out. Rivers got weird."
38:38;38:42;"But I mean, there's definitely some good songs after the first two."
38:42;38:49;"For sure. I mean, like, what do you... Okay, like after the first two, like, what are your go-to Weezer songs?"
38:49;38:55;"Like, to me, it's like Islands in the Sun or whatever. It's like, that's not top shelf Weezer."
38:55;38:57;"It might be their most popular song."
38:57;38:58;"I think it is."
38:58;39:01;"I know, but just in terms of Jake's takes."
39:01;39:09;"Okay, there is a song, a middle period Weezer song I liked called Dope Nose. Can we throw that on?"
39:09;39:11;"I love Dope Nose."
39:11;39:15;"Let's see how this holds up."
39:45;39:48;"Oh yeah, I love this chorus."
39:59;40:01;"Is it top shelf Weezer? I don't know."
40:05;40:07;"This song has very strange lyrics."
40:27;40:31;"It's like a big, kind of like, feel good 70s chorus."
40:31;40:38;"I think it's sort of like when they fully embrace their, like, his love of... You know, he always said his, like, Kiss was his favorite band."
40:38;40:39;"Yeah."
40:39;40:47;"And I just feel this is when he just, like, fully was like, let's f*** it. Let's just make big anthemic stuff or something."
40:47;40:50;"Yeah, that's what they were doing in the beginning, though. I mean, they always..."
40:50;40:54;"No, I know, but it was always had a weird lo-fi... It's always been there, but like..."
40:54;40:57;"Yeah, this is like, he's leaning into the classic rock a bit here."
40:57;41:01;"Like, this big solos, I just don't think that they had..."
41:01;41:17;"I think in the first two records, you get the big, kind of, anthemic stuff, but there's like a core, kind of, like, vulnerability and sadness to that earlier stuff that I
think he excised because the failure of Pinkerton in his eyes as he saw it."
41:17;41:22;"I mean, I guess he saw it as a commercial failure and a critical one, maybe."
41:22;41:27;"And I think it just, like, crushed him. And he's like, well, I'm not going to show that part of myself again."
41:27;41:28;"That's the story."
41:29;41:31;"And they're sticking to it."
41:31;41:35;"It tracks in their music, I think. I don't know."
41:35;41:45;"Did any of those first two albums... I mean, maybe Pinkerton in its own weird way did, but they didn't have that kind of solo we just... like, that weird solo that we just
heard."
41:45;41:53;"No, they have solos, but that one was more classic rock. So this is getting more pastiche and fun on Dope Nost."
41:53;41:55;"Yeah, I don't like that."
41:55;41:59;"You want just the classic Weezer play the melody?"
41:59;42:06;"Yeah, just the more, like, simple, kind of, more emotional stuff. I don't like when they're, like, kind of shredding. It's just kind of corny."
42:06;42:13;"Somebody requested this song, I think at Red Rocks. Or they requested Weezer, and we tried to do a little bit of Say It Ain't So."
42:13;42:28;"And I've always been struck by, like, you know, Weezer's one of those bands that, obviously, in Rivers Cuomo's extraordinarily talented songwriter, it just so
happens that their first album is just f***ing perfect."
42:28;42:37;"You could say that about a lot of bands. There are probably a lot of people who think the first Vampire Weekend album might be our best album, or it has a certain quality
that is, you know, that classic, like..."
42:37;42:38;"A purity, an innocence."
42:38;42:54;"A purity. Because for me, of course, I've listened to Pinkerton in my day. Pinkerton is an album I was just coming online enough, because I was 12, that I remember
listening to K-Rock, the New York K-Rock, and hearing the single El Scorcho."
42:54;43:05;"I had no idea about the narrative that that album being, like, not a bit of a failure or whatever. I just remember hearing El Scorcho on the radio and be like, ""This guy
f***ing can write a song. Great song."""
43:05;43:11;"I love El Scorcho. And I remember I recorded it off the radio, and I was just like, ""These guys can't mess."""
43:14;43:16;"El Scorcho!"
43:47;43:49;"He's singing, too!"
44:16;44:23;"All respect to Pinkerton, and obviously its status grew and grew over the years. But, like, come on. Blue album is..."
44:23;44:31;"Oh, yeah. I go back to the Blue record. And those B-sides. The Michael and Carly, the Suzanne. Yeah."
44:31;44:47;"Well, we could do a deep dive maybe on a couple Weezer songs. I mean, I would start with, to me, the perfect Weezer song is ""Say It Ain't So."" Is that fair to say? It's got the
emotion. I mean, that's number one for me. I could pick something else, but I'd be lying."
44:47;45:07;"Have I mentioned on the show that the ""Undone Sweater"" song was my brother's bar mitzvah song? That my mom found a clearance sale of hundreds of Maxi singles of
""Undone."" Oh, yeah. And she gave them to all the kids. That was the gift to all the kids. Oh, my God. Amazing."
45:16;45:20;"Wait, actually, pause it for a second. I've always wanted to kind of do a deep dive on these lyrics."
45:20;45:25;"Yeah, this is some of the more, like, pointed lyrics he's written, I feel like."
45:25;45:43;"It's such an interesting song, because, like, I also think that the mood of the song is so perfect. You know, like, there's a little bit... they go into ska a little bit.
And there's, like, this kind of sweetness, where it's almost like some kind of SoCal, like, let the good times roll, like, kickback."
45:43;46:00;"But then, obviously, it's about, like, kind of dysfunctional family stuff. And even, like, so those opening lines, ""Somebody's hiney,"" which I think growing up, I
always thought of, like, being the word for, like, butt, which I always found very disturbing, ""hiney."" But he's talking about a Heineken."
46:00;46:01;"Oh, yeah."
46:01;46:19;"""Somebody's hiney is crowding my icebox. Somebody's cold one is giving me chills. Guess I'll just close my eyes. Oh, yeah. All right. Feels good. Inside."" Very strong
and evocative and weird way to open a song."
46:19;46:23;"It almost sounds like it's been taken from real life."
46:23;46:51;"I was gonna say, it feels like one of the few... again, I'm really, really only familiar with the early work. It feels like one of the... especially on the first record,
one of the lyrics, a few lyrics that feels really specific. I mean, I guess there's the ""in the garage,"" he's talking about his, like, kiss posters and stuff. But a lot of
the other songs are just kind of, like, very broad, romantic love songs or heartbreak songs. They're very broad. ""Thing Ain't So"" is, like, hyper specific."
46:51;47:19;"I mean, obviously, we all know the song, so it's no spoiler. But, like, it's funny. I think of the song as clearly is about the narrator's dad. But actually, you don't
really get into that until that amazing bridge. So still in the beginning, it's like, is he like a kid? And he's just like, his alcoholic dad is having a barbecue with his
friends. And he's just like that visual of a bunch of adult men pounding brews in the backyard."
47:19;47:20;"Heinekens?"
47:20;47:24;"Well, or is it about, like, a stepdad or something? That's interesting."
47:24;47:29;"Yeah, I also thought it was a stepdad or something. I don't know. I don't know why I thought that, but..."
47:29;47:30;"Keep going."
47:30;47:42;"Right, because the nice box is just a refrigerator. You just picture, like, a kid coming home and, like, your mom's new boyfriend is there and you, like, open the fridge
like, ""Hey, mom, is there any, like, peanut butter and jelly?"" And there's, like, a sixer of Heineken that you've never seen before."
47:42;47:44;"Whoa. What's this?"
47:44;47:45;"Guys."
47:45;47:46;"Yeah?"
47:46;47:48;"Do you want me... spoiler alert? Or should we deep dive before I tell you what it's about?"
47:48;47:50;"No, no, tell us at the end. Tell us at the end."
47:50;47:51;"Great. All right. That's what I'm here for."
47:51;47:52;"All right, keep going."
47:53;47:55;"Aw, yeah"
47:55;47:58;"All right"
47:58;48:01;"Feels good"
48:01;48:04;"Inside"
48:04;48:08;"Flip on the teddy"
48:08;48:11;"Wrestle with Jenny"
48:11;48:14;"Something is bubbling"
48:14;48:17;"Behind my back"
48:18;48:23;"The bottle is ready to blow"
48:23;48:31;"Say it like so"
48:31;48:35;"Your drug is a heartbreaker"
48:35;48:37;"Your drug is a heartbreaker"
48:37;48:43;"Say it like so"
48:44;48:50;"My love is a heartbreaker"
48:50;49:00;"Oh, yeah, I love that tasteful noodling."
49:00;49:01;"Yeah."
49:01;49:02;"Kind little solo."
49:02;49:05;"I can't confront you"
49:05;49:08;"I never could do"
49:08;49:11;"That which might hurt you"
49:11;49:14;"To try and be cool"
49:14;49:16;"And I say"
49:16;49:18;"This way"
49:18;49:20;"Is a water slide away from me"
49:20;49:23;"That takes a fuller everyday"
49:23;49:26;"To be cool"
49:26;49:34;"Say it like so"
49:34;49:40;"Your drug is a heartbreaker"
49:40;49:43;"Your drug is a heartbreaker"
49:43;49:49;"Say it like so"
49:49;49:55;"My love is a life taker"
49:55;49:59;"Hey, daddy, I'm right too"
49:59;50:02;"This bottle gives us silence"
50:02;50:05;"It cleans up, found Jesus"
50:05;50:09;"Things are good, oh, so I hear"
50:09;50:12;"This awakens ancient feelings"
50:12;50:15;"Like father, stepfather"
50:15;50:19;"The sun is drowning in the blood"
50:19;50:21;"Perfect bridge."
50:21;50:22;"Yeah."
50:22;50:25;"Back into that emotional..."
50:25;50:36;"Yeah, great melody line here."
50:37;50:40;"(Humming)"
50:40;50:46;"Shout out Pat Wilson on drums, too."
50:46;50:48;"Perfect drummer for this band."
50:48;50:55;"Your drug is a heartbreaker"
50:55;50:58;"I like how their harmonies are kind of rough."
50:58;50:59;"Yeah, it is."
50:59;51:02;"Say it like so"
51:03;51:08;"My love is a life taker"
51:08;51:22;"The one line that I've always wondered about is"
51:22;51:26;"""This bottle of Stevens awakens ancient feelings."""
51:26;51:30;"Like, I kind of assume that Stevens must be like some whiskey brand, but maybe..."
51:30;51:32;"Yeah, like scotch or something."
51:32;51:34;"Maybe the bottle belongs to Steven."
51:34;51:36;"Is Steven the stepdad or something?"
51:36;51:37;"Oh, nice. I like that."
51:37;51:43;"This bottle of Stevens awakens ancient feelings"
51:43;51:47;"Apparently Rivers Cuomo's stepfather was Steven."
51:47;51:49;"Oh, okay. So it is the bottle that belongs to Steven."
51:49;51:53;"So he like found like an old dusty bottle like under the cabinet."
51:53;51:54;"Right. Is it?"
51:54;51:57;"Because Stevens cleaned up and found Jesus."
51:57;52:00;"No, I think that's his biological father."
52:00;52:01;"Ah, ah, ah."
52:01;52:05;"Also, Russell with Jimmy is his younger brother."
52:05;52:07;"It's his brother Jimmy. Okay."
52:07;52:12;"This is my guess. And then I want to hear, Nick, if there is this ""true"" story."
52:12;52:16;"Is it like maybe this kid is like 12 or 13?"
52:16;52:20;"Like that age where you might like have your first drink, you know?"
52:20;52:23;"I don't know about you guys, but like being at some kid's house and be like,"
52:23;52:25;"""Should we try to like drink some vodka?"" And be like, ""Oh, shit."""
52:25;52:26;"Yeah, you like..."
52:26;52:29;"And maybe his dad's been gone for a while."
52:29;52:32;"And his stepdad just moved in."
52:32;52:34;"And he's slamming brews in the house."
52:34;52:36;"And the vibe is kind of off."
52:36;52:39;"And when he says, ""Your drug is a heartbreaker,"""
52:39;52:41;"maybe the stepdad's an alcoholic."
52:41;52:46;"So it's kind of like, ""I can't believe that my mom's dating this like brutal dude."
52:46;52:48;"His drug is a heartbreaker."""
52:48;52:50;"Like he turns into a different person."
52:50;52:51;"Alcohol being the drug."
52:51;52:56;"And maybe this kid's at this like kind of turning point where he's about to like grow up."
52:56;52:58;"And it makes him think about adulthood."
52:58;52:59;"And he starts drinking."
52:59;53:01;"He finds Steven's bottle."
53:01;53:03;"And then he starts like thinking about his dad."
53:03;53:06;"And like he can't believe that this is how things have turned out."
53:06;53:10;"Like this flood of emotions about his parents splitting up comes out."
53:10;53:14;"Is this remotely close, Nick, to what the internet says?"
53:14;53:17;"Yeah, I think you're-- I mean, I've listened to the song thousands of times."
53:17;53:19;"It's very straightforward."
53:19;53:21;"But no, it's very straightforward."
53:21;53:25;"It just-- the story is interesting."
53:25;53:29;"Or the actual sort of kernel of the actual inspiration."
53:29;53:33;"So it's about Cuomo's personal experience and emotions."
53:33;53:36;"The song's lyrics were inspired by a traumatic moment in Cuomo's childhood"
53:36;53:41;"when he mistakenly thought that his parents' divorce was caused by his mother's relationship with another man."
53:41;53:44;"In the song, he references finding a beer in the refrigerator"
53:44;53:47;"and associating it with the painful memories of his father leaving the family,"
53:47;53:50;"leading to fears of his stepfather might do the same."
53:50;53:54;"So I think that the beer in the icebox is like, ""Oh, is this someone else's beer?"""
53:54;53:56;"Like yet another dude?"
53:56;53:57;"Yet another dude."
53:57;53:59;"Someone's hiney."
53:59;54:00;"Someone's hiney."
54:00;54:02;"The telltale Heineken."
54:02;54:05;"Yeah, so maybe this is like-- I mean, what this is saying is that--"
54:05;54:11;"so his father left, thinking it was because of this mom's extramarital affair or whatever."
54:11;54:15;"And that maybe this is taking place with his stepdad, thinking now his stepdad's going to leave."
54:15;54:21;"And just the idea of a beer in the icebox being like, ""Oh, this is-- someone else is over the house,"" or something."
54:21;54:23;"Right. But so he actually-- he likes his stepdad."
54:23;54:25;"This is a pro-stepdad song."
54:25;54:27;"Yeah, at that age, yes."
54:27;54:29;"I think it feels like it's pro-dad."
54:29;54:32;"Pro-male figure in your life."
54:32;54:34;"But your drug is a heartbreaker."
54:34;54:36;"But that is alcohol somehow?"
54:36;54:38;"My love is a lifetaker?"
54:38;54:39;"Yeah, yeah."
54:39;54:41;"Which maybe is the reason that his dad left."
54:41;54:43;"I could do deeper dives, but yeah."
54:43;54:45;"Well, I guess also in that second verse,"
54:45;54:51;"""When I say this way is a water slide away from me that takes her further every day, so be cool,"""
54:51;54:53;"that's about his relationship with the mom."
54:53;54:57;"He's scared of messing something up and angering the mom."
54:57;54:59;"Yeah."
54:59;55:02;"Yeah, I guess that's-- I mean, it's straightforward in a sense, but it's also like--"
55:02;55:04;"So be cool."
55:04;55:07;"Remember when we were talking about Nirvana?"
55:07;55:17;"We were talking about one of the major drivers of the grunge movement is the normalization of divorce in the '60s and '70s."
55:17;55:19;"I love that theory."
55:19;55:21;"I mean, the timing works out here."
55:21;55:29;"Just like '90s music, '90s guitar music, one of the major pillars of it is divorce."
55:29;55:34;"All these bands and all these people are the generation where there was the most divorce,"
55:34;55:36;"more than the decades before and after."
55:44;55:53;"Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be"
55:53;56:01;"As a friend, as a friend, as I've known and be"
56:01;56:09;"Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late"
56:09;56:19;"Take a rest, as a friend, as I've known and be"
56:19;56:23;"And be"
56:27;56:32;"And be"
56:32;56:35;"Beautiful, nuanced song."
56:35;56:38;"I mean, what are your guys' top Weezer, top Blue album?"
56:38;56:44;"I mean, I guess the quintessential Weezer song for me is, ""My name is Jonas."""
56:44;56:47;"Yeah, what's that all about? That also feels kind of like..."
56:47;56:48;"No idea."
56:48;56:52;"That also gives me the vibe of a kid reckoning with issues."
56:52;56:57;"Kind of similar. That's my guess, but I don't remember any of the words besides, ""I'm carrying the world."""
56:57;56:59;"Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff about like..."
56:59;57:00;"Throw it on."
57:00;57:04;"Wearing hard hats to work and foreman has injured his hand."
57:04;57:13;"My name's Jonas, I'm carrying the world"
57:13;57:22;"Thanks for all you've shown us, this is how we feel"
57:22;57:26;"Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea"
57:26;57:30;"Just like Grandma Madeline could might see"
57:30;57:34;"Things were better then, wish would never again"
57:34;57:40;"We've all left the den and tied by a choo-choo train left ride on time"
57:40;57:42;"Choo-choo train, choo-choo train."
57:42;57:46;"I've never thought about these lyrics or even really listened to them."
57:46;57:49;"Driver said, ""Hey man, we go all the way"""
57:49;57:54;"Of course we were willing to pay"
57:55;58:03;"My name is Wee Pill"
58:03;58:05;"My name is Wee Pill?"
58:05;58:09;"Yeah, this vocal line goes great."
58:09;58:14;"Oh yeah, they're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise."
58:14;58:21;"Tell me what to do, now they're taking stride"
58:21;58:25;"Now they're singing, ""Now what else can I do?"""
58:25;58:29;"I'm a street man, no milk to drink"
58:29;58:32;"I'm a street man, no milk to drink"
58:35;58:40;"I'm a street man, no milk to drink"
58:40;58:44;"I'm a street man, no milk to drink"
58:48;58:51;"Workers are going home"
58:51;58:57;"The kids are playing with toy excavators and bulldozers"
58:57;58:59;"and they're pretending the workers are going home."
58:59;59:03;"It's like from the perspective of an eight-year-old or a three-year-old."
59:03;59:05;"Very Lego movie."
59:05;59:08;"Is it an adult looking back on being eight years old?"
59:08;59:24;"No, I think it's something from the perspective of a child."
59:24;59:26;"Who are the workers?"
59:26;59:28;"It's pretend."
59:28;59:33;"You know when you're playing with toys and you're in the choo-choo train in your mutt"
59:33;59:37;"when you watch a kid play and they're taking the Lego people"
59:37;59:39;"and they're like ""Oh, these are the workers."
59:39;59:44;"This is the mommy and the daddy and this is the baby."""
59:44;59:47;"Yeah, I can kind of see that."
59:47;59:50;"I mean, I would have never thought about this."
59:50;59:53;"It'd be a little bit fancy to see two eight-year-olds playing."
59:53;59:54;"You're like, ""What are you guys doing?"""
59:54;59:57;"It's like, ""Oh, we built a factory out of Legos."""
59:57;59:59;"And it's like, ""Oh, what are the guys doing?"""
59:59;01:00:02;"And it's like, ""Well, this is the foreman and he's injured his hand,"
01:00:02;01:00:05;"so he's going to the hospital."""
01:00:05;01:00:07;"I guess that could happen."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"And then the workers are going home."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"The workers are going home."
01:00:18;01:00:23;"Yeah, that's one of those songs where I have an emotional response to it,"
01:00:23;01:00:28;"but it has nothing to do with the lyrics or the logic or the storytelling of the lyrics."
01:00:28;01:00:33;"It's completely the arrangement and the performance."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"What about the lyrics in an impressionistic way?"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"I've never thought about what that song's about,"
01:00:37;01:00:42;"but the thing that I always remembered from that song is,"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"""He's got a box full of your toys."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"They're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise."""
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Making noise, making noise."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Yeah."
01:00:50;01:00:57;"Is that maybe his older stepbrother who gave him a box of toys?"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"But this song, too, feels haunted by--"
01:01:00;01:01:05;"I mean, it's very similar to Nirvana, but haunted by something going wrong in childhood."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Yeah."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"""Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea, just like Grandma made"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"when we couldn't find sleep."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"Things were better then, once but never again."

01:15:25;01:15:33;"Why"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"Bottled up at this time"
01:15:45;01:15:49;"Won't you let me be"
01:15:49;01:15:53;"Bottled up at this time"
01:15:53;01:15:57;"Won't you rescue me"
01:15:57;01:16:01;"Bottled up at this time"
01:16:01;01:16:05;"It's all I can see"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"Should have been here last night"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"To hear what the Big Dipper said"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"There's a great song on here called ""Twin Falls, Idaho,"""
01:16:14;01:16:16;"which is a complete childhood song."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"I love that song."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"Oh, I know that song, too."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"Yeah, that's a great one."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"I think I've said on the show before"
01:16:21;01:16:25;"that DeAndre made this great CD mixtape"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"that was all songs under two minutes,"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"or around two minutes, and that was on it."
01:16:30;01:16:33;"Because I think that song's almost exactly two minutes or something."
01:16:33;01:16:37;"Christmas Twin Falls, Idaho"
01:16:37;01:16:42;"Is her oldest memory"
01:16:42;01:16:46;"She was only two"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"It's the first time she felt blue"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"I haven't heard this in a long time"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"Cafeteria Harrison"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"Elementary"
01:16:59;01:17:03;"Beneath a parachute"
01:17:03;01:17:08;"I saw her without shoes"
01:17:08;01:17:12;"Seven up, I touched her thumb"
01:17:12;01:17:16;"She knew it was me"
01:17:16;01:17:20;"Though she couldn't see"
01:17:20;01:17:24;"Unless, of course, she peed"
01:17:24;01:17:29;"My mom's good, she got me out of"
01:17:29;01:17:33;"Twin Falls, Idaho"
01:17:33;01:17:37;"Before I got too old"
01:17:37;01:17:41;"You know how that goes"
01:17:41;01:17:45;"That's where she still was the summer"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"She turned seventeen"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Nineteen"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"I'm coming up empty on the Marsh parents."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"It's funny, if you ask Chad GBT, it says,"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"""Doug Marsh, the frontman of Build a Spill,"
01:17:58;01:18:04;"has not publicly discussed the marital status of his parents."""
01:18:04;01:18:05;"Well, you know, in this song he says,"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"""My mom got me out of Twin Falls, Idaho."""
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Yeah."
01:18:09;01:18:13;"I think that sounds like a single mom."
01:18:21;01:18:24;"Oh, that's right, and then it goes into this jam."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"Also, you could see Weezer doing this."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"Yeah, I wish they did more, I mean, yeah,"
01:18:39;01:18:44;"there was like ""Only in Dreams,"" which is more structured than this,"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"or like more kind of, it's just tighter maybe,"
01:18:46;01:18:49;"but I wish Weezer did more of that."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"I mean, Doug's leaning into his like Neil Young love,"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"that in a way that Rivers,"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"I don't really hear a Neil Young influence on Rivers."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"No, there's never been that shagginess."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Yeah."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"He's a kiss guy."
01:19:07;01:19:10;"He's a SoCal kiss guy."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"I mean, listen to all this music."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I don't know if it's a selection bias thing."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Yeah."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"The thing about like, something about Twin Falls, Idaho,"
01:19:48;01:19:53;"the Blue album, and then our long discussion about Nirvana a few months ago,"
01:19:53;01:20:00;"I just feel like just so much of the music from this time period is like,"
01:20:00;01:20:05;"has this like weird kind of like haunted nostalgia for childhood."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Yeah."
01:20:06;01:20:11;"I mean, like obviously, it's like the Azareth book like really made me think"
01:20:11;01:20:15;"deeply about like Kurt's life and the extent to which, you know,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"those crazy quotes in the book are not crazy."
01:20:17;01:20:22;"I mean, those like intense, intensely emotional quotes where he says stuff like,"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"""Yeah, I was happy until I was,"" whatever he says, ""eight,"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"and then I was never happy again."""
01:20:28;01:20:31;"The music for children of divorce is really--"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Yeah."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"You're right because I feel in the '70s or '80s,"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"like people are looking back at their childhood were like, ""My childhood sucked."""
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Like that was whack."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Yeah."
01:20:40;01:20:47;"They're referencing these small glimmers of like, ""I felt safe then,"" or--"
01:20:47;01:20:51;"I mean, even just the fact like multiple references to grandma."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Like--"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"There was a period of--"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"River sings about grandma."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"The Kurt sings about like, ""Grandma, I want to go home."""
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Like, do--"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"It's sort of when the dream ended, which I don't--"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"You know, that sort of childhood, whatever level of protection,"
01:21:10;01:21:15;"whatever the false reality or whatever, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"But I don't think you get that from music in the '80s."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"Yeah."
01:21:19;01:21:23;"And grandma could be a symbol of a lot of things in a turbulent childhood."
01:21:23;01:21:27;"It could be a symbol of stability, like your parents are going through it."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"You go spend time at grandma's house and it's kind of good vibes over there."
01:21:30;01:21:35;"Or in the Kurt version of like, ""Grandma, I want to go home,"""
01:21:35;01:21:37;"you're shoved off to grandma's house and you're like,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"""God, something went wrong here. Why am I not with my parents?"""
01:21:41;01:21:50;"But, yeah, I wonder if the early '90s there's more bands referencing grandma than in other eras."
01:21:50;01:21:58;"And even just like the nostalgia factor of like talking about toys and TV shows from the past."
01:21:58;01:22:01;"I guess there-- Of course, there's nostalgia in every generation,"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"but there's like a pointed version of it where it's like,"
01:22:04;01:22:09;"""Remember when we were kids?"" And there's like this heaviness to it."
01:22:09;01:22:16;"Like when-- I don't know, when River sings about like the Dungeons & Dragons or--"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Yeah."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Or Mary Tyler Moore."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Like, childhood was like a fantasy."
01:22:22;01:22:27;"I know, I'm thinking about how like a show like The Wonder Years is about being a kid."
01:22:27;01:22:33;"And you're like, ""Remember when we were kids and our brothers and sisters were in Vietnam?"""
01:22:33;01:22:35;"That wasn't like a really fun time."
01:22:35;01:22:40;"I don't know, there's this idea that it was maybe an illusion of fun or whatever."
01:22:40;01:22:44;"Like before the dream-- Like I'm saying, before the dream broke, you know?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"Mm-hmm."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"And then you're like, ""Oh yeah, our parents got divorced. They never liked each other."""
01:22:49;01:22:51;"I don't know."
01:22:51;01:22:59;"It doesn't feel like the same level of nostalgia for the '50s and '60s even, you know?"
01:22:59;01:23:04;"Yeah, whereas, I mean, all this stuff is so reductive, like huge grain of salt."
01:23:04;01:23:09;"But even if I think about like what's a classic when people make fun of millennials,"
01:23:09;01:23:18;"like millennial culture, a classic thing they like to rib, which is highly laughable,"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"but is all that like merch from like, I don't know when it would be, like the early 2010s"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"that basically say like, ""Adulting is hard."""
01:23:24;01:23:25;"Yeah."
01:23:25;01:23:31;"Because, you know, coffee mugs or sweatshirts or something where it's like, ""Ugh, adulting is hard."""
01:23:31;01:23:39;"Where it's almost like, again, very, very broad strokes that if like the millennial version was like,"
01:23:39;01:23:47;"""Childhood was awesome. And then I got to adulthood and adulting was hard. What?"
01:23:47;01:23:51;"Can I just like still be a kid forever? Because like, you know what?"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"I still like to watch Disney movies and like eat ice cream or whatever."""
01:23:54;01:23:59;"Like that's like an interesting contrast to the music of this time at least,"
01:23:59;01:24:03;"which clearly was reflective of some percentage of people's experience, which was something."
01:24:03;01:24:08;"Yeah. This like childhood was already shattered and you're looking through the shards,"
01:24:08;01:24:12;"looking for those moments of peace and you're almost like haunted by it versus like,"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"I arrived, I was happy until adulthood."
01:24:15;01:24:23;"Obviously the current version is I was happy until I was seven versus I was happy until I was, you know, 25."
01:24:23;01:24:26;"And then I realized, hold up, I'm working in an office."
01:24:26;01:24:31;"You know, just like two different ways of looking at like the phases of life."
01:24:31;01:24:38;"I wonder what the like real young generation, like the art produced by like the kind of like COVID generation."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"I mean, I'm sure you guys have had these conversations a million times."
01:24:41;01:24:49;"Like Jake, me and you, our kids are little, so they don't remember anything about COVID."
01:24:49;01:24:53;"I always think about like the kids for whom it like,"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"I just think about the stuff that like is just so huge for you."
01:24:56;01:25:01;"The TV shows, the experiences that happened to you from ages."
01:25:01;01:25:07;"What do you think is like the true sweet spot? Like seven through four, like 13 or something, you know?"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"In terms of maximum impact?"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Yeah. In terms of..."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"When you say sweet spot, what do you mean?"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"The sweet spot, I think max is 12."
01:25:15;01:25:21;"Like you remember it so deeply and you're not totally, you're not like in the driver's seat yet."
01:25:21;01:25:26;"Like I think by the time you're 14 or 15, those experiences are huge too."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"But you're just like more in the driver's seat or something."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Like seven through 12."
01:25:31;01:25:38;"I feel like when I was like 13 and not just because I had a bar mitzvah and became a man in the Jewish faith."
01:25:38;01:25:41;"But like, I just feel like I was like online in a different way."
01:25:41;01:25:44;"And then, you know, obviously you don't remember much stuff when you're really little."
01:25:44;01:25:55;"Like seven through 12 is like this first big like inhale of like the world and those things like stay with you, but you're still kind of forming."
01:25:55;01:25:59;"Whereas by the time you're like 13 or 14, you're like, you're there."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"You're not totally grown up, but you're like there. I don't know."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"I know that's pretty vague."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"But like, again, I'm thinking about Kurt."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Obviously, I keep coming back to this."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"That his parents didn't get divorced when he was two."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"They didn't get divorced when he was 16."
01:26:13;01:26:20;"They got divorced in that middle zone, like a particularly interesting developmental phase of life."
01:26:20;01:26:27;"Because again, like I think for a lot of adults, even if they were like lockdown was horrible, COVID was horrible."
01:26:27;01:26:36;"It's still kind of like we were adults and like whether you liked elements of it or you hated it, you got through it and it was, you know."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Yeah."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"But then I think about the kids in that zone."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"Who were like seven, eight."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"Yeah, I guess seven through like 13."
01:26:43;01:26:46;"I mean, obviously, if you're in high school, that's crazy too or college."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"But I just wonder if that will, how it'll manifest."
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Yeah, I mean, I can speak directly to that."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"So like with Max, who is eight, right?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Like eight to 10 is when it happened."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"And he's in this like very, I think you're right."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"I think that that pocket is totally formative."
01:27:04;01:27:07;"And for Max, it was like a very good experience."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Because you're right."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"You're not in the driver's seat."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"It's just formative."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"You don't look at it even necessarily as good or bad."
01:27:13;01:27:18;"It's just sort of, it is developmentally helps you become who you will be."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"And for Max, it was like he could do online school."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"There's kids who couldn't do it."
01:27:22;01:27:28;"But for the most part, you're not reflecting on it, even as like a necessarily good or bad experience."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"You're just like, this is my experience."
01:27:30;01:27:33;"And, you know, that's just formative."
01:27:33;01:27:38;"But maybe if he'd been 11 or 12, it would have been a whole different story."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Disruptive."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"I guess we've been like disruptive."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Yeah."
01:27:41;01:27:50;"So basically what I'm asking is, is what type of lyrics and guitar tones are we going to be hearing in about eight to 10 years?"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"The reason I was thinking about this is like, when did Kurt's like parents get divorced?"
01:27:53;01:27:57;"Because if it's like eight to 10, it's like, I think it just sort of becomes what your life is a little bit."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"If it's later, you're just like, f**k."
01:28:00;01:28:02;"Well, but Kurt was extremely sensitive."
01:28:02;01:28:07;"So his reaction and the way he describes it was like searing pain."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Is like more of an adult."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Yeah, he was young."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Yeah."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Like more or like a 13, 14 year old."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Yeah."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Yes."
01:28:14;01:28:15;"Yeah, exactly."
01:28:15;01:28:22;"And I guess, of course, like, you know, like we talked about with Nirvana, two dudes in that band came from divorced families,"
01:28:22;01:28:26;"could not have more different kind of like demeanors, Dave Grohl versus Kurt."
01:28:26;01:28:32;"But yeah, Kurt was on the young side, but describes it as life altering, never happy again."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"The way, yeah, the way that you might expect from a slightly older kid."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Yeah."
01:28:36;01:28:40;"And maybe he's clearly a very unique person with a deep, deep sensitivity."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"What else should I be?"
01:28:43;01:28:47;"All apologies"
01:28:47;01:28:51;"What else could I say?"
01:28:51;01:28:56;"Everyone is gay"
01:28:56;01:29:00;"What else could I write?"
01:29:00;01:29:04;"I don't have a right"
01:29:04;01:29:08;"What else should I be?"
01:29:09;01:29:12;"All apologies"
01:29:12;01:29:19;"In the sun, in the sun"
01:29:19;01:29:26;"Here is one in the sun, in the sun"
01:29:26;01:29:29;"Mary"
01:29:29;01:29:33;"Mary"
01:29:35;01:29:40;"Clearly, every generation, you find the same archetypes over and over again."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"And the more things change, the more they stay the same."
01:29:42;01:29:49;"But I could picture a kid who's 12 or 13 being like at this formative age, like I just realized I couldn't trust anything."
01:29:49;01:29:58;"And, you know, the same way that a kid who takes a divorce really hard is like, whoa, I can't I can't even trust those people to stay together."
01:29:58;01:30:04;"I can't trust, you know, the same way that a kid might be like, I was going through life."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"I went to I went to first grade."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"I went to second grade, went to third grade, you know, like following the path."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"And I played I played Little League and I did this and that."
01:30:11;01:30:15;"And then I hit this moment where just like, yeah, it was shut down."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"It was taken away."
01:30:17;01:30:27;"And maybe some of those kids, I wonder if there's going to be I could also picture this generation being so into covid conspiracies like that could be maybe the Bob Dylan
of this generation will be writing like a murder."
01:30:27;01:30:32;"Most fell about covid in 50 years because it'll be just such a crazy event for them."
01:30:32;01:30:36;"Or flip side, who gives a life goes on."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"That sucked."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Let's party."
01:30:38;01:30:55;"That could happen to."
01:30:55;01:31:00;"There's another album that came out in 1994 called Chocolate and Cheese."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"What's the best song on chocolate and cheese?"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"What Diener was talking about?"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Have we not played that?"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"It's it's under two minutes."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Great."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"It's exactly two minutes."
01:31:09;01:31:10;"Let's just listen straight through."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"It's one of my favorite Ween songs."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"It's beautiful."
01:31:13;01:31:25;"It's beautiful."
01:31:25;01:31:42;"It's a. I think I must be dreaming."
01:31:42;01:31:57;"I guess."
01:31:57;01:32:13;"I might even slip you something."
01:32:13;01:32:36;"I guess."
01:32:36;01:33:02;"I guess."
01:33:02;01:33:07;"I guess."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"As we're what were you saying?"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"I was saying this song sounds so much like a certain vein of MGMT."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"Uh huh."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"Sure."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Who definitely I imagine are massive Ween fans."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Oh yeah."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"I feel like Ween is really in the air lately."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Have the kids discovered Ween?"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"It's a good question."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"You just you just seeing a lot of references."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"I think following JD Vance."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Oh right."
01:33:28;01:33:34;"But even before the JD Vance thing, I just feel like I've heard more like music from like newer bands."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I feel like, oh, maybe they're into Ween."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"I don't know."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Just Ween feels like very relevant lately."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"I feel like they're kind of like evergreen a little bit."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Right."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Like they haven't dated in quite the way."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Yeah."
01:33:46;01:33:54;"They don't have that sort of 90s adolescent emotional palette that like the Weezer and even the Bill to Spills and the Nirvanas have."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"They're coming from truly left field."
01:33:56;01:34:03;"Yeah. Maybe their sense of humor is like, like really works with these times or something."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"I think it's the same thing."
01:34:05;01:34:13;"You know, we've talked about the Fish Ween kind of dichotomy and how Fish is back in the conversation the way the Dead was."
01:34:13;01:34:19;"Like, I do think that, yeah, there's something about the sense of humor, something about, I don't know."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"It's like there's an edge to it."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"It's like f***ed up."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"They've got some great songs."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"Absolutely."
01:34:25;01:34:32;"But yeah, I feel like they've been pretty, at least on my radar, they've been pretty evergreen, pretty consistent in their presence."
01:34:32;01:34:36;"And that's like, there's such a pillar band for you and like you were there for it."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"Wasn't that your first COVID show, if I remember right?"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"Oh, right. Yeah."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"I went to Wiltern."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"Masked up?"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"I was, because we had like a baby."
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Masked up at the Ween show."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"I was really close."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"I was like really like on the stage."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"Yeah."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"And I was the only dork wearing a mask."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"Out of respect for my wife, it was her request."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"Did we lose Ezra?"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"It looks like we lost him."
01:35:02;01:35:05;"[Laughter]"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"Ezra tapping out."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"Yep."
01:39:24;01:39:27;"This is more like a turbulence or emergency."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"That's kind of an emergency."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"Oh yeah, the oxygen masks have dropped."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Yeah, the oxygen masks have dropped."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"We're hitting some severe hundreds."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Okay, well let's just..."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"One thing that Ween..."
01:39:39;01:39:45;"There was one incident online where Ween was making some waves"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"was the JD Vance playlist that came out."
01:39:48;01:39:53;"Some music sleuths were digging around"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"and found a playlist he had made."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"And there was a Ween song off La Cucaracha,"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"which is their last record."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"I actually didn't really know that record that well."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"From 2007. It's kind of interesting."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"He just stopped making records in 2007."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"Oh yeah, there was a song that he had on his playlist"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"called ""With My Own Bare Hands,"""
01:40:10;01:40:13;"which is not a good song, and it's real gnarly."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"I mean, it's funny."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"Was there a theme to this playlist?"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"I think it was like, hump up music, or..."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"I don't know. I forget."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"Maybe like workout music, or like running music?"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"Let's throw it on."
01:40:26;01:40:31;"I can build an aeroplane"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"That travels over land"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"I can take your DNA"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"And replicate a man"
01:40:40;01:40:44;"I can do so many things"
01:40:44;01:40:49;"With my own bare hands"
01:40:49;01:40:55;"I'd love to be your ass, chicken"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"Stick it up in your..."
01:40:58;01:41:01;"I'm gonna be your lawnmower"
01:41:01;01:41:04;"And cut your...grass"
01:41:04;01:41:07;"I can do so many things"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"This tracks."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"With my own bare hands"
01:41:13;01:41:21;"Is this the tone of the whole La Cucaracha record?"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Loving that Dean tone there."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"But is this the vibe of the record?"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"No, it's all over the place."
01:41:28;01:41:43;"She's gonna be my professor"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Studying my..."
01:41:45;01:41:49;"She's gonna get a master's degree"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"In...me"
01:41:52;01:41:57;"I can do so many things"
01:41:57;01:42:01;"With my own bare hands"
01:42:01;01:42:06;"Tap all the..."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Move a dripper..."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"All night"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Kick it with the..."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Grab a..."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"Suck my..."
01:42:16;01:42:21;"I can do so many things"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"With my own bare hands"
01:42:25;01:42:30;"I discovered this song called ""Woman and Man,"""
01:42:30;01:42:33;"which is like a nine-minute absolute banger."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"It's like a huge jam on it."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"It's the second-to-last song on the record,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"and I've been listening to ""Woman and Man"" a lot."
01:42:39;01:42:42;"And then the last song on this record is called ""Your Party,"""
01:42:42;01:42:44;"which you probably know."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Oh, this is one of my...this is a classic."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"This is an all-timer."
01:42:48;01:42:54;"This is fitting that this is the last song on the last Mean album."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"""Tricolored Pastas""?"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"""Tricolored Pastas""? Get out of here."
01:42:58;01:43:03;"There were candy and spices"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"And tricolored pastas"
01:43:06;01:43:12;"The meat carved was drawn from succulent juices"
01:43:12;01:43:17;"Served on platters of the purest gold"
01:43:17;01:43:20;"I don't know what voice he's doing here."
01:43:20;01:43:31;"I was calm when we arrived at the party"
01:43:31;01:43:37;"I spoke with fervor, embracing the evening"
01:43:37;01:43:43;"My wife leaned over and she whispered, ""I love you"""
01:43:43;01:43:49;"I held her close and we danced"
01:43:49;01:43:54;"We had the best time at your party"
01:43:54;01:43:59;"The wife and I thank you very much"
01:43:59;01:44:04;"We had the best time at your party"
01:44:04;01:44:08;"The wife and I thank you very much"
01:44:08;01:44:31;"Cream puffs and bourbon and the music was louder"
01:44:31;01:44:37;"My wife was competing in a game of chance"
01:44:37;01:44:43;"The party raged and the guests were screaming"
01:44:43;01:44:49;"I could have danced all night"
01:44:49;01:44:53;"We had the best time at your party"
01:44:53;01:44:59;"The wife and I thank you very much"
01:44:59;01:45:04;"We had the best time at your party"
01:45:04;01:45:08;"The wife and I thank you very much"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"guitar solo"
01:45:48;01:45:54;"Later on when we were under the covers"
01:45:54;01:46:00;"I closed my eyes and I drifted to sleep"
01:46:00;01:46:06;"I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party"
01:46:06;01:46:14;"I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party"
01:46:14;01:46:20;"I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party"

01:46:40;01:46:46;"I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party"
01:46:52;01:46:57;"Sometimes I wonder why"
01:46:57;01:47:03;"You do these things to me"
01:47:03;01:47:09;"Sometimes I wonder"
01:47:09;01:47:15;"That you ain't never loved me"
01:47:15;01:47:20;"Sometimes I say I'm late"
01:47:20;01:47:26;"Yeah, I haven't fallen"
01:47:26;01:47:32;"Yes, I guess you know by now"
01:47:32;01:47:38;"That you ain't that little"
01:47:38;01:47:44;"Yeah, baby"
01:47:44;01:47:50;"Oh, some things that you promised me"
01:47:50;01:47:55;"You say just because I'm slow"
01:47:55;01:48:01;"You vanish like a dream"
01:48:01;01:48:07;"Baby, I wonder why"
01:48:07;01:48:13;"You do these things to me"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"Yes, I'm late"
01:48:16;01:48:24;"Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way"

01:48:36;01:48:42;"Just waiting on the sun"
01:48:42;01:48:47;"Just like you're burning that cigarette"
01:48:47;01:48:52;"It's throwing my love"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"What do I do?"
01:48:54;01:48:58;"I wonder why"
01:48:58;01:49:03;"Why do you do these things to me?"
01:49:03;01:49:07;"Baby, oh, I'm late"
01:49:07;01:49:11;"Now I've found my way"
