00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, a very special episode. This week we check in with Sweet Martha to"
00:07;00:13;"find out what's going on in Minnesota. We also compare the top five hits of"
00:13;00:20;"Jake's Birth Year '77 with mine, 1984. All this plus Droga 5, The Rolling"
00:20;00:29;"Stones, and Tobin Sprout and Tim Allen. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:29;00:31;"And the TV beats won."
00:39;00:53;"I felt wobbly, all my right foot chances My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:04;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:04;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying Leave the lonely man"
01:15;01:17;"Time Crisis back again."
01:17;01:20;"This is an early record."
01:20;01:25;"We're spiritually live with you July 29th, but we had to get this one pretty early because"
01:25;01:27;"I'm in Japan."
01:27;01:28;"You're playing a show in Japan today?"
01:28;01:29;"This is a hilarious tour."
01:29;01:31;"I mean, this is just how it is over there."
01:31;01:34;"Two week tour, two shows."
01:34;01:35;"Wait, really?"
01:35;01:37;"Yeah, because one's in Australia, one's in Japan."
01:37;01:38;"Why only two shows?"
01:38;01:41;"Why not do four shows in each country?"
01:41;01:42;"It's a hassle."
01:42;01:45;"And also, you know, there's like radius clauses and stuff."
01:45;01:47;"Well, Australia is really crazy because..."
01:47;01:48;"Radius clauses?"
01:48;01:49;"Radius."
01:49;01:51;"You're not familiar with radius clauses?"
01:51;01:52;"No."
01:52;01:54;"Sounds like a guy to buy voices song."
01:54;01:56;"Radius clauses."
01:56;02:01;"I'm familiar with the concept if you go to a town and you're playing like a big venue,"
02:01;02:05;"that venue doesn't want you to play like a small secret show the night before."
02:05;02:06;"Right."
02:06;02:09;"And the exact same thing is true with festivals."
02:09;02:10;"Oh, festies."
02:10;02:11;"Yeah."
02:11;02:15;"So you think if you're going to play Coachella that you could just do two nights at the forum"
02:15;02:16;"with impunity?"
02:16;02:22;"No, but maybe you could play a show in like Springfield, Illinois, like a few days before."
02:22;02:23;"Exactly."
02:23;02:25;"Hence the radius clause."
02:25;02:28;"Yeah, but you're saying the entire country is the radius?"
02:28;02:30;"No, I'm not saying that."
02:30;02:33;"And I don't even know about these two festivals, but well, okay."
02:33;02:36;"You can't play a show in Melbourne if you're playing a show in Sydney?"
02:36;02:38;"They're both difficult countries to tour."
02:38;02:40;"I'm pissed."
02:40;02:46;"Australia is funny too, because infamously you leave Tuesday night from LA, you get in"
02:46;02:47;"Thursday."
02:47;02:48;"Whoa."
02:48;02:53;"So it's kind of like, I'm going to leave Tuesday night on Thursday, going to go link up with"
02:53;02:56;"the record label, play the album for some Australians."
02:56;02:59;"I guess you gain that day when you go back?"
02:59;03:00;"Yeah, kind of."
03:00;03:04;"Because that's weird to really truly lose a day."
03:04;03:05;"Yep."
03:05;03:06;"That's trippy."
03:06;03:09;"So already just the flight alone is quote unquote two days."
03:09;03:14;"Get in, go, you know, hang with the label and play the album and stuff."
03:14;03:19;"Then go to the town where the festival is called Splendor in the Grass, kind of like"
03:19;03:21;"an iconic Australian festival."
03:21;03:24;"And so then we got to go up to Byron, because in Australia you got to fly everywhere."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:29;"I remember when we did this like long Australian tour called Groovin' in the Moo."
03:29;03:30;"Moo?"
03:30;03:33;"Yeah, I think it was a reference to like farm towns."
03:33;03:34;"Okay."
03:34;03:37;"I was super into the festival and the shows."
03:37;03:38;"Getting from place to place was kind of brutal."
03:38;03:42;"Because my understanding, the way they told us about this, this is like on the second"
03:42;03:46;"album or something, they were like, the cool thing about Groovin' in the Moo is like, you're"
03:46;03:50;"going to these kind of off the beaten path Australian towns that like, normally if somebody"
03:50;03:55;"just come to do like a whirlwind global tour, they might just play Sydney and Melbourne."
03:55;03:56;"That might be it."
03:56;03:59;"Unless you're like huge in Australia and you book a whole tour around it."
03:59;04:02;"But this was interesting because we were like, I remember one place we played was called"
04:02;04:04;"Townsville, which we thought was kind of funny."
04:04;04:06;"Just like sounds so made up."
04:06;04:08;"What up Townsville?"
04:08;04:13;"Those shows, I just remember like the vibe was always like, play the show, get in the"
04:13;04:19;"van, two and a half hours back to the hotel, lobby call at seven, like another hour to"
04:19;04:21;"the airport, fly."
04:21;04:22;"I think this is true."
04:22;04:24;"I feel like somebody said this to me."
04:24;04:26;"It's the same size as the US."
04:26;04:28;"Perth is on the West Coast."
04:28;04:32;"That's a six hour flight from the East Coast, roughly."
04:32;04:35;"Might be wrong a little bit, but I think to properly tour Australia, which I hope we get"
04:35;04:39;"to do again, Australia is a major Vampire Weekend country."
04:39;04:42;"Well, I still don't understand why you can't, I guess I don't understand why you're not"
04:42;04:44;"playing like two or three shows."
04:44;04:46;"Even on the size of the country."
04:46;04:51;"Well, I think because in Australia, it's just simply not possible for us in this timeframe."
04:51;04:52;"Okay."
04:52;04:53;"I won't drill down on it any further."
04:53;04:54;"There's also crazy stuff too."
04:54;04:56;"That's like, it takes a minute."
04:56;04:59;"You know, Australia to Japan is a 12 hour flight."
04:59;05:01;"That's kind of brutal too."
05:01;05:02;"You kind of feel like, all right, I'm here."
05:02;05:03;"Yeah."
05:03;05:04;"I wouldn't think it was that far."
05:04;05:07;"That's like going from like LA to like Paris or something."
05:07;05:08;"Yeah."
05:08;05:09;"Wow."
05:09;05:12;"So there's a lot of flying and then like the gear has to be shipped."
05:12;05:14;"That's a whole other interesting world."
05:14;05:15;"Not on the plane?"
05:15;05:17;"Oh, you can't bring that on a commercial flight."
05:17;05:19;"You see all that Vampire Weekend gear."
05:19;05:20;"How does it go?"
05:20;05:21;"Vintage amps."
05:21;05:23;"Is it like kind of like a two drum sets?"
05:23;05:24;"You're right, man."
05:24;05:25;"Backdrop."
05:25;05:27;"These are logistics that I'm not privy to."
05:27;05:29;"So is this pedal boards?"
05:29;05:33;"Is it getting loaded onto like a FedEx or like a some sort of like commercial cargo"
05:33;05:35;"flight or is it going overseas?"
05:35;05:36;"No, it's not going on."
05:36;05:38;"It's gotta be on a, it's gotta be a plane."
05:38;05:39;"It would be so cool."
05:39;05:43;"Dude, the boat sank."
05:43;05:44;"All our gear is gone."
05:44;05:51;"On stage at Fuji Rock just being like, uh, do any of the other bands have an acoustic?"
05:52;05:53;"Yeah."
05:54;05:55;"I'm just kidding."
06:00;06:01;"Yeah."
06:01;06:07;"Well, I'm flying across the land trying to get a hand playing in a traveling band."
06:07;06:09;"Take me to the hotel bag is gone."
06:09;06:11;"Oh, well, come on, come on."
06:11;06:13;"Won't you get me to my room?"
06:13;06:14;"I won't move."
06:14;06:17;"Playing in a traveling band."
06:17;06:18;"Yeah."
06:18;06:24;"Well, I'm flying across the land trying to get a hand playing in a traveling band."
06:24;06:27;"Listen to the radio talking about the last show."
06:27;06:30;"Someone got excited, had their collar stay malicious."
06:30;06:31;"Won't move."
06:31;06:34;"Playing in a traveling band."
06:34;06:35;"Yeah."
06:35;06:41;"Well, I'm flying across the land trying to get a hand playing in a traveling band."
06:41;06:42;"Wow."
06:42;06:47;"Yeah, it's gotta be a plane, but as I understand it, luckily I don't personally deal with this"
06:47;06:48;"stuff."
06:48;06:51;"You know, it's like we go on, you know, when you're, maybe when you're just starting out,"
06:51;06:55;"you might check all your gear and like borrow a drum set when you get to the venue."
06:55;06:56;"Right, you just bring your cymbals."
06:56;07:02;"But when you're doing like a big tour and you have set pieces and a lot of gear, no,"
07:02;07:03;"it has to all go together."
07:03;07:07;"So my understanding is that, you know, outside of the commercial flights that the humans"
07:07;07:11;"take, there's a whole shadow network of, yeah, like global cargo, freighting."
07:11;07:12;"Yeah."
07:12;07:16;"And like there's big companies that specialize in this, specifically music."
07:16;07:17;"Really?"
07:17;07:18;"Yeah."
07:18;07:20;"Flying musical gear."
07:20;07:22;"There's a big one called Rocket Cargo."
07:22;07:27;"And one time I was just like browsing vintage clothing on Etsy or eBay or something."
07:27;07:31;"And I came across, it was like Rolling Stones, 1990 Rocket Cargo tour."
07:31;07:37;"Like Rocket Cargo made their own jacket for a Rolling Stones tour asking for 250."
07:37;07:41;"So it was the jacket that the employees of Rocket Cargo wore?"
07:41;07:42;"Something like that."
07:42;07:43;"Yeah."
07:43;07:46;"Schlepping the hard cases on and off these cargo planes."
07:46;07:47;"Yeah."
07:47;07:48;"Love that."
07:48;07:55;"I feel like in another life I could see like Jake being like a top man at Rocket Cargo."
07:55;07:56;"I'll take it."
07:56;07:57;"Yeah."
07:57;08:00;"It is this funny thing that like, obviously we're privileged not to have to think about"
08:00;08:04;"as the musicians, but every once in a while I'll be like talking to our guys and they'll"
08:04;08:07;"be like, well, you've got an offer to play like a festival in Ireland, but it's the day"
08:07;08:09;"before, you know, this other festival."
08:09;08:12;"And I'm like, all right, so is it doable?"
08:12;08:14;"He's like, we can get you guys there."
08:14;08:19;"Logistically, there's like a ferry involved and the gear, you know, it could be a little"
08:19;08:20;"touch and go."
08:20;08:22;"The gear might not be there."
08:22;08:26;"Or like one time, one of our touring guys, and they know this inside and out."
08:26;08:27;"And it is a very interesting world."
08:27;08:31;"It was like just telling me about the routing of like somebody else's tour."
08:31;08:33;"Like, let's say it was like Chili Peppers in South America."
08:33;08:37;"And he was like, they did like some ambitious freighting."
08:37;08:42;"They did Bogota, you know, and Buenos Aires back to back."
08:42;08:44;"That's a very ambitious freighting."
08:44;08:46;"And I'm sure it's true."
08:46;08:49;"Like that's the, you know, it takes a lot to put these shows on."
09:20;09:33;"Yeah, I mean, I used to work in art museums and stuff."
09:33;09:35;"And that's a whole other world."
09:35;09:38;"Just like the back of house stuff, like the crating."
09:38;09:39;"I always think about that."
09:39;09:46;"The insane levels of like climate control, crates and stuff are really old pieces of work."
09:46;09:47;"Right."
09:47;09:51;"And like, there'll be like a dude, like he has to travel with just one painting."
09:51;09:56;"Like if the painting is going from, let's say London to Chicago for an exhibition,"
09:56;09:57;"and it's like some old Van Gogh or something."
09:57;09:58;"Yeah."
09:58;10:00;"There's a dude that travels with that painting."
10:00;10:02;"On a commercial flight?"
10:02;10:03;"Yes."
10:03;10:04;"But like has, has."
10:04;10:05;"Is he checking it?"
10:05;10:06;"Well, it depends on the size."
10:06;10:07;"Okay, this, it gets into a whole other thing."
10:07;10:08;"If it's small."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:09;10:10;"They'll have it with them."
10:10;10:11;"In their lap."
10:11;10:12;"Yes."
10:12;10:13;"Just like sitting next to some rando."
10:13;10:14;"Hey man, how you doing?"
10:14;10:16;"What line of work are you in?"
10:16;10:18;"I'm transporting a $300 million Van Gogh."
10:18;10:21;"Van Gogh, can I take a peek?"
10:21;10:23;"Come on, crack it open."
10:23;10:25;"Come on, this guy's got a Van Gogh right here."
10:25;10:27;"Let me buy you a drink, buddy."
10:27;10:30;"I don't think I've ever heard a story though, you know, thankfully,"
10:30;10:32;"about a crash or something bad happening."
10:32;10:38;"There's someone just like a cargo plane carrying like $2 billion worth of Rembrandts."
10:38;10:39;"Went down."
10:39;10:43;"Went down as it flew to Dubai for the art fair."
10:43;10:44;"The art fair."
10:44;10:46;"There's a cool Rembrandts at an art fair."
10:46;10:48;"Well, no, they, they, yeah, there are."
10:48;10:52;"No, yeah, you can picture some like crazy private museum or something in Dubai"
10:52;10:55;"and some dude putting on like a Rembrandt show."
10:55;10:59;"I mean, I remember being at like a Art Basel in Miami and seeing like some,"
10:59;11:02;"obviously it's not the majority of the fair,"
11:02;11:04;"but there'd be like some really blue chip things you'd walk over"
11:04;11:06;"and there'd be like a Picasso."
11:06;11:10;"Okay, Rembrandt would be pushing it at the Art Basel in Miami."
11:10;11:11;"Right."
11:11;11:14;"Maybe like a Picasso etching or something, maybe one painting."
11:14;11:16;"That even seems like it's pushing it."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah, you're probably right."
11:17;11:22;"I can picture a Rembrandt at, well, because you hear about these major art fairs"
11:22;11:23;"in other parts of the world."
11:23;11:24;"Yeah."
11:24;11:28;"There's more of like a nascent global capital art world vibe."
11:28;11:29;"Sure, sure."
11:29;11:31;"And I've been there chucking in a few Rembrandts."
11:31;11:32;"No."
11:32;11:35;"How many Rembrandts do you think there are in the Gulf?"
11:35;11:36;"In existence?"
11:36;11:37;"No."
11:37;11:38;"Oh, in the Middle East?"
11:38;11:39;"Yeah."
11:39;11:41;"One or two in private collections."
11:41;11:42;"Or museums."
11:42;11:43;"I don't know."
11:43;11:44;"I've never been."
11:44;11:46;"How many Rembrandts do you think there are in China?"
11:46;11:51;"God, this is a good question because the major institutions in Europe and the U.S.,"
11:51;11:55;"you know, bought all the Rembrandts, let's say 19th century."
11:55;12:03;"Also think about all the precious art that the West has plundered from other parts of the world."
12:03;12:05;"It's about time to get some Rembrandts over there."
12:05;12:07;"I don't think there's a lot of Rembrandts just like--"
12:07;12:09;"In private collections."
12:09;12:11;"Or I guess museums do trade, so you could be like,"
12:11;12:13;"""Oh, yeah, there's one that's at a museum for two years right now."""
12:13;12:14;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
12:14;12:15;"You-- oh, trade."
12:15;12:17;"Museums will lend pieces."
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:19;"Not really trade."
12:19;12:21;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch on that?"
12:21;12:24;"How many Rembrandts are there in the Middle East?"
12:24;12:32;"I was going to say that I would bet 98% of the Rembrandts are in New York, London, the Netherlands."
12:32;12:34;"Right, because there's like a Rembrandt museum in the Netherlands?"
12:34;12:35;"Probably."
12:35;12:38;"There's like a whole Rembrandt room at the Met."
12:38;12:39;"We just got some intel."
12:39;12:42;"Time Crisis is the home of live Google research."
12:42;12:44;"That should be a new-- such a part of this show."
12:44;12:45;"Oh, yeah."
12:45;12:46;"Live Google research."
12:46;12:50;"We end up on a really random conversational tangent."
12:50;12:51;"Yeah."
12:51;12:52;"And then we end up Googling."
12:52;12:53;"Right."
12:53;12:54;"It's just like hanging out."
12:54;12:55;"Yeah, exactly."
12:55;12:56;"We bring the real-- This is just a hangout show."
12:56;12:58;"--the real-life experience to people."
12:58;13:01;"Some shows prepare, have pages of research."
13:01;13:07;"Time Crisis, we come up with an improvisational idea live, kind of like John Coltrane or The Grateful Dead."
13:07;13:10;"We riff on it, and we're going to Google it live with you."
13:10;13:13;"Okay, this guy Thomas Kaplan owns some Rembrandts."
13:13;13:18;"""We've been lending to about 40 museums around the world,"" Thomas Kaplan tells Post Magazine."
13:18;13:21;"""We used to do that anonymously, and we liked it that way."
13:21;13:23;"Owning doesn't confer respectability."
13:23;13:28;"We had no desire for the social cachet that would come with being seen as big collectors."""
13:28;13:32;"But the couple have decided a low-key approach no longer strikes the right note."
13:32;13:37;"In Shanghai, the city where collectors often live by the motto, ""If you got it, flaunt it,"""
13:37;13:42;"Kaplan explains that he is taking his paintings around the world to spread the word about his other passions,"
13:42;13:48;"saving big cats and using art to promote a sense of cultural openness and shared humanity."
13:48;13:53;"In September, he is in Shanghai to launch the ""Laid-in Collection"" exhibition at the Long Museum,"
13:53;13:58;"where visitors are the first to see 78 of the collection's highlights under one roof."
13:58;14:03;"A smaller selection was unveiled at the Louvre in Paris and Beijing's National Museum of China."
14:03;14:08;"The exhibition will travel to the Louvre Abu Dhabi when it leaves Shanghai in February."
14:08;14:11;"Right, Louvre Abu Dhabi, that must have all sorts of--"
14:11;14:14;"Rembrandts on cargo planes going around the world."
14:14;14:16;"Rembrandts are making the rounds."
14:16;14:18;"Got the insurance on that kind of stuff."
14:18;14:21;"What's the most expensive art you've ever handled?"
14:21;14:23;"That's an interesting question."
14:23;14:27;"You ever touched, like, a 17th, 18th century type painting?"
14:27;14:29;"I want to say so, but maybe not."
14:29;14:32;"I worked at the Hammer and I worked at SF MoMA."
14:32;14:34;"So those are more modern stuff?"
14:34;14:35;"Yeah, more modern."
14:35;14:36;"Would you ever handle, like, a Warhol?"
14:36;14:38;"Oh, yeah, for sure."
14:38;14:40;"I probably-- I want to say a Picasso."
14:40;14:41;"You handled a Picasso?"
14:41;14:44;"I think so. It's really not-- when you're doing that work, it's not a--"
14:44;14:46;"you're not like, ""Oh, my God, it's a Picasso."""
14:46;14:49;"I mean, you are in the sense that you want to be careful,"
14:49;14:51;"but you're being careful with everything in a museum."
14:51;14:52;"Right."
14:52;14:54;"Remember when Steve Wynn put his elbow through a Picasso?"
14:54;14:55;"His finger, yeah."
14:55;14:56;"Oh, yeah."
14:56;14:59;"As an artist yourself and an art appreciator, does that, like, break your heart?"
14:59;15:01;"No, I think it's hilarious."
15:01;15:04;"He owned it and he put his finger-- he's like, ""Look!"" and he, like--"
15:04;15:05;"A few times, though, right?"
15:05;15:06;"I think it was just once."
15:06;15:11;"He put his finger right through it, which is crazy because canvas is, like, taught."
15:11;15:12;"I don't know how--"
15:12;15:15;"Like, he must have really been gesticulating."
15:15;15:18;"Or it's just, like, gives you a sense of how, like, brittle and rotten"
15:18;15:21;"the support was that it was on, you know, like paintings."
15:21;15:24;"I bet Picasso was using, like, cheap burlap or something"
15:24;15:27;"that's already, like, 100 years old that's been eaten away by oil paint."
15:27;15:31;"When you talk to other art handlers, will people be like, ""Oh, yeah, I handled that""?"
15:31;15:32;"No."
15:32;15:35;"You wouldn't be just sitting around, somebody would reference a specific painting"
15:35;15:37;"and be like, ""Oh, yeah, I handled that in '97""?"
15:37;15:39;"No. That would be hilarious."
16:17;16:38;"Speaking of art, this came across our desk a few weeks ago."
16:38;16:42;"Tim Allen did an interview where he discussed his love for the paintings"
16:42;16:45;"of Guided by Voice's Tobin Sprout."
16:45;16:49;"This is from Stereogum. This is the opening of the Stereogum article."
16:49;16:50;"""A-woo!"""
16:50;16:53;"Wait, what noise did Tim Allen make? Was it ""A-woo-ga"" or just--"
16:53;16:54;"No, it was like, ""A-woo-ga""?"
16:54;16:55;"""A-woo-ga""?"
16:56;16:57;"I never saw that show."
16:57;16:58;"What?"
16:58;16:59;"You never saw Home Improvement?"
16:59;17:00;"Nope."
17:00;17:02;"Seinfeld. Which is better, Home Improvement or Friends?"
17:02;17:06;"Oh, boy. Um, I'm going to have to go with Home Improvement on principle."
17:06;17:09;"Don't even front. Don't even front."
17:09;17:13;"You would rather sit down and watch a bunch of Friends than Home Improvement."
17:13;17:15;"That's a tough one. I wanted to say earlier, by the way,"
17:15;17:18;"the composers of the Friends theme, the Rembrandts."
17:18;17:19;"Nice, dude."
17:19;17:20;"Oh, yeah."
17:20;17:21;"Shout out to them."
17:21;17:22;"Full circle."
17:22;17:24;"Should we listen to a little bit of that? Would you like to hear it, Seinfeld?"
17:24;17:25;"Oh, boy."
17:25;17:28;"[singing]"
17:28;17:31;"Did they write that song for the theme or was that composed--"
17:31;17:32;"I think that was--"
17:32;17:33;"Or was that on a record?"
17:33;17:35;"That was already single, but then was like--"
17:35;17:36;"And Friends blew it up."
17:36;17:37;"I think so, yeah."
17:37;17:40;"Was that from like the '80s or was it from that era, like '90s?"
17:40;17:41;"It's from the '90s."
17:41;17:44;"Yeah, because you can hear that Gin Blossom style production on it."
17:44;17:46;"It's like a little bit of a throwback."
17:46;17:47;"Oh, for sure."
17:47;17:48;"Birdseas or something."
17:48;17:49;"Yeah, exactly."
17:49;17:50;"Big star."
17:50;18:01;"[singing]"
18:01;18:05;"Jake, do you think if Friends didn't exist and you just heard this song in the '90s,"
18:05;18:07;"you probably would have been like, ""Try it."""
18:07;18:09;"I might be, yeah, at the time."
18:09;18:11;"It kind of sounds like Green Day, dude."
18:11;18:12;"I don't know if there's anything--"
18:12;18:13;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
18:13;18:14;"This is so '90s."
18:14;18:16;"I don't think there's anything more '90s than this song."
18:16;18:18;"Dude, you can totally picture Billy Joe singing this."
18:18;18:19;"Like on the Dookie record."
18:19;18:21;"Remember the music video for this?"
18:21;18:25;"It was like the whole Friends cast, like, bumbling around with instruments."
18:25;18:28;"The chorus was a little too saccharine, maybe, for my taste."
18:28;18:33;"But, like, I never got deep on the Gin Blossoms or like--"
18:33;18:37;"What was that band that had that song, like, ""Deep Blue Something""?"
18:37;18:38;"Yeah, that was the band."
18:38;18:39;"Like, ""Goodnight."""
18:39;18:40;"Like the--"
18:40;18:41;"Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
18:41;18:42;"Breakfast at Tiffany's song."
18:42;18:45;"[singing]"
18:45;18:51;"Yeah, it's like very clean, borderline sterile recordings of like--"
18:51;18:54;"It has a lot in common with music that you do like."
18:54;18:56;"I think one thing with this band and the Rembrandts,"
18:56;19:00;"like, there's not enough character in the singer's voice."
19:00;19:02;"I think that was maybe something that--"
19:02;19:03;"Shots fired?"
19:03;19:04;"I mean--"
19:04;19:05;"Shots fired."
19:05;19:06;"I'm not trying to be hard--"
19:06;19:09;"I'm just thinking, like, the songwriting is cool,"
19:09;19:12;"but, like, the performance was a little generic."
19:12;19:13;"And maybe--"
19:13;19:14;"Kind of like that band Orleans."
19:14;19:15;"And maybe lyric--"
19:15;19:16;"We've joked about--"
19:16;19:17;"From the '70s?"
19:17;19:19;"I feel like we've joked about that band Orleans a little bit."
19:19;19:20;"Yeah, definitely."
19:20;19:23;"[singing]"
19:27;19:40;"I'd be remiss if I didn't correct myself."
19:40;19:42;"I'm on the Wikipedia page for the Friends theme song."
19:42;19:43;"Yeah."
19:43;19:47;"And it was co-written by the co-creators of the TV show Friends."
19:47;19:48;"What?"
19:48;19:50;"Yeah, David Crane and Marta Kaufman."
19:50;19:51;"Wow."
19:51;19:53;"What did they write? Just some lyrics?"
19:53;19:57;"I think they wrote the lyrics, and then the Rembrandts did the composition."
19:57;20:00;"Yeah, you know, it's funny, because actually when I think about it,"
20:00;20:06;"this is a little earlier, but when you talk about that same type of, like, '90s jangle revival--"
20:06;20:07;"Yeah."
20:07;20:09;"--but something that has a little more character--"
20:09;20:10;"Yeah."
20:10;20:11;"--I think of this."
20:13;20:15;"Do you know this one?"
20:15;20:16;"Yeah, I do."
20:16;20:17;"James?"
20:17;20:18;"Right."
20:18;20:19;"Way bigger in England than in the state."
20:19;20:20;"Right."
20:20;20:21;"This is a great song."
20:29;20:31;"Yeah, much more distinct singing voice."
20:31;20:32;"[singing]"
20:32;20:34;"I mean, really my theory is that to be a great band,"
20:34;20:38;"you have to have a really distinct idiosyncratic singer."
20:38;20:39;"That's the theory."
20:42;20:44;"Listen to that wet snare."
20:48;20:50;"[singing]"
20:50;20:55;"Like superficially, that and Deep Blue Something have quite a bit in common, for sure."
20:55;20:57;"I feel bad for the Deep Blue Something singer."
20:57;20:59;"He doesn't have an idiosyncratic voice."
20:59;21:01;"I mean, I don't know the deep cuts."
21:01;21:05;"Maybe he, like, is a super unique singer, but on that song, he kind of, like--"
21:05;21:10;"The singing was just--all what struck me is, like, a little too careful and, like, tentative."
21:10;21:13;"It's not, like, a confident--it's just, like--it's a cool song."
21:13;21:20;"Can you name, like, a true classic band where the singer is not super original and unique?"
21:20;21:22;"Well, that's slightly a chicken or the egg thing, right?"
21:22;21:24;"Because once a band becomes classic, the--"
21:24;21:27;"I was thinking about that, too, with, like, presidents."
21:27;21:29;"I don't know if it is a chicken or the egg thing."
21:29;21:33;"So, for instance, every U.S. president, at least in our lifetime,"
21:33;21:36;"has had this--a very distinctive voice."
21:36;21:38;"Like, it's so easy."
21:38;21:46;"You don't have to be Frank Caliendo to do a serviceable Trump-Obama-W-Clinton impression."
21:46;21:47;"Because I always, like, think about--"
21:47;21:48;"Jimmy Carter didn't really."
21:48;21:50;"I guess. I wasn't alive, so--"
21:50;21:54;"Also, when Obama first came on the scene, I remember thinking his voice was not very distinctive."
21:54;21:56;"And it wasn't until Fred Armisen did an impression of him."
21:56;21:57;"So that's my point."
21:57;21:58;"I keep it cool. Then I was like, ""Oh, wow, he does--"""
21:58;22:00;"Now, because we've heard these voices so much--"
22:00;22:01;"Right."
22:01;22:04;"--anybody on the street could probably do a decent Obama impression."
22:04;22:06;"Now, some folks are saying that--"
22:06;22:07;"Yeah."
22:07;22:08;"--uh, blah, blah, blah, blah."
22:08;22:09;"Oh, man."
22:09;22:10;"Now, let me be clear."
22:10;22:11;"Oh, man."
22:11;22:12;"Yeah, well, I don't know."
22:12;22:13;"[laughter]"
22:13;22:15;"It's like, Obama just has such a very distinct--"
22:15;22:16;"But, so, my question is--"
22:16;22:17;"Yeah."
22:17;22:21;"--if you had just been like, ""Hey, there's this guy from Chicago listening to his voice,""--"
22:21;22:22;"Right."
22:22;22:26;"--would we have been like, ""He's got a very unique cadence, a very distinctive way of speaking,"""
22:26;22:30;"or is it that it's drilled into our head, so now Obama has an iconic speaking style?"
22:30;22:35;"Well, like, yeah, what if like, Jeb Bush had won the presidency?"
22:35;22:38;"Right, would we all be kind of like, ""No Jebisms""?"
22:38;22:39;"And I mean, Jeb--"
22:39;22:40;"Probably."
22:40;22:44;"--we watched a bunch of Jeb that was like Vic Berger videos were hilarious of him talking."
22:44;22:46;"But, yeah, he didn't have--or--"
22:46;22:49;"It's the theory if Jeb Bush had a distinct voice, maybe he'd be president."
22:49;22:50;"See, that's what I can't figure out."
22:50;22:53;"Obviously, like, Trump--well, Trump's been famous for 30--"
22:53;22:54;"Yeah."
22:54;22:57;"--plus years that he already has this distinctive way of talking, but--"
22:57;23:02;"Or do you need a distinctive cadence to be president/singer in a successful band?"
23:02;23:03;"If I was running for president--"
23:03;23:04;"Yeah."
23:04;23:08;"--what do you think the, like, Jake-isms or the people that do impressions of me--"
23:08;23:10;"Like, what would be the--"
23:10;23:11;"Yeah, well--"
23:11;23:12;"--thing to latch onto?"
23:12;23:16;"See, that's funny. It's like I've known you for a long time, and you do have a very distinctive voice and way of speaking,"
23:16;23:21;"but, yeah, maybe because I've never seen it parodied or something, I wouldn't know exactly--"
23:21;23:23;"Candidate Jake Longstreth."
23:23;23:24;"I mean, you say like--"
23:24;23:25;"Oh, bro!"
23:25;23:27;"You say ""man"" a lot. You know what I noticed?"
23:27;23:30;"Because we're taping this one in the morning, we walked in, there was coffee and donuts,"
23:30;23:35;"and this is something that you say a lot. You see me go, ""Damn, son!"""
23:35;23:38;"[laughter]"
23:38;23:42;"I don't know how many of these things you'd be saying in your stump speech."
23:42;23:45;"Right. The housing crisis in Southern California is brutal."
23:45;23:46;"Yeah."
23:46;23:48;"Homeless situations effed."
23:48;23:50;"Bands--yeah, I mean, you have that--"
23:50;23:51;"[imitates a band]"
23:51;23:53;"You have that kind of cadence."
23:53;23:57;"A band where the person doesn't have a ""distinctive voice."""
23:57;24:02;"There's bands that are sort of like, not super iconic, bands like Squeeze or something,"
24:02;24:07;"where it's like, kind of distinctive. I think those guys have distinctive voices."
24:07;24:11;"But maybe it's true in everything, even if you look at the biggest pop stars of all time."
24:11;24:12;"Sure."
24:12;24:15;"Michael Jackson. Insanely unique."
24:15;24:16;"Oh, yeah."
24:16;24:17;"I mean, who's big now?"
24:17;24:18;"Drake."
24:18;24:21;"Drake's got a very specific tone and texture."
24:21;24:22;"You know who doesn't?"
24:22;24:23;"Who?"
24:23;24:24;"Ed Sheeran."
24:24;24:29;"Even Ed Sheeran, as time goes on, and he becomes such a permanent part of culture,"
24:29;24:32;"I feel like you know his voice."
24:32;24:35;"I'm saying the actual timbre of his voice."
24:35;24:36;"Timbre."
24:36;24:38;"It's pronounced ""tom-ber."""
24:38;24:39;"No, it's ""tam-ber."""
24:39;24:40;"I'm just messing with you."
24:40;24:41;"But you know what's funny? There was just a Seinfeld--"
24:41;24:42;"Timber."
24:42;24:45;"I was just watching a Seinfeld episode where George is like, ""The timber of her voice!"""
24:45;24:47;"And Jerry's like, ""I think it's timbre."""
24:47;24:48;"Yeah."

25:54;25:56;"Were we talking about Tim Allen?"
25:56;25:59;"So back to Tim Allen and Home Improvement."
25:59;26:01;"Home Improvement 2000."
26:01;26:03;"He's not a fan of Guided by Voices."
26:03;26:09;"He is a fan of Tobin Sprout's paintings, who was the secondary songwriter in GBV."
26:09;26:13;"He did a 17-minute audio interview about that very subject."
26:13;26:15;"I guess--well, they're both Midwestern."
26:15;26:20;"Tim Allen owns a home along Lake Michigan near Tobin Sprout's family home."
26:20;26:24;"And he came across some of his paintings at a gallery in Leland, Michigan."
26:24;26:26;"His perspective is pretty particular, Allen notes."
26:26;26:28;"It's kind of like a semi-wide-angle lens."
26:28;26:30;"There's a whimsical kind of cartoony."
26:30;26:31;"There's too much of something."
26:31;26:33;"I can't be specific about it."
26:33;26:34;"It affected me."
26:34;26:36;"I like his composition because, again, it's not dead-on."
26:36;26:37;"It's a little asymmetrical, I guess."
26:37;26:41;"I watched the video, and there was one passing reference to GBV."
26:41;26:42;"Not by name."
26:42;26:44;"Tim was just like, ""Tobin's an interesting guy."
26:44;26:45;"He's this great painter."
26:45;26:47;"He's got this rock and roll band."""
26:47;26:50;"And then the interviewer clearly had no interest in the band."
26:50;26:53;"And they were just going deep on Tobin's photorealistic paintings,"
26:53;26:55;"which I've been a fan of, too, for a long time."
26:55;26:56;"Really?"
26:56;26:57;"Oh, yeah."
26:57;26:59;"So Tobin Sprout is just a member of Guided by Voices?"
26:59;27:04;"Yeah, he always contributed one or two or three songs"
27:04;27:06;"to those real classic records."
27:06;27:09;"There was this--I think it's a Tobin Sprout song that I always liked."
27:09;27:11;"Oh, yeah, do you know this one?"
27:11;27:12;"This is a Tobin Sprout song."
27:17;27:18;"It's called ""Small Parade."""
27:18;27:20;"I weirdly don't--is this on a solo record?"
27:20;27:24;"It was on a Matador compilation called ""What's Up, Matador?"""
27:24;27:25;"Okay."
27:27;27:29;"He has a great voice."
27:58;28:00;"Did he put out a lot of solo albums?"
28:00;28:05;"Yeah, there's a record he put out maybe 20 years ago called ""Moonflower Plastic."""
28:05;28:06;"Yeah."
28:06;28:07;"So good."
28:20;28:21;"You get the idea."
28:21;28:22;"Beautiful."
28:22;28:23;"What's Tim Allen's story, anyway?"
28:23;28:25;"He's like super right-wing?"
28:25;28:26;"Yeah, because that's true."
28:26;28:27;"Is he a trope guy?"
28:27;28:33;"Because that show ""Last Man Standing,"" I think it was all about the--I don't know how to say it diplomatically,"
28:33;28:37;"but the erosion of Tim Allen culture in America."
28:37;28:39;"Oh, I don't know the show."
28:39;28:40;"What's the show?"
28:40;28:41;"Is it on?"
28:41;28:48;"It's about him because he's like an aging right-wing white guy and probably his daughter's woke or something."
28:48;28:50;"Is it a sitcom?"
28:50;28:53;"He's a senior employee of a sporting goods store in Denver, Colorado."
28:53;28:54;"Denver."
28:54;28:56;"Married father of three daughters."
28:56;28:58;"That's a real lefty town."
28:58;29:04;"And the series includes interactions expressing his conservative political views, and I think it was canceled, right?"
29:04;29:07;"Oh, yeah, and he said that they took him off the air because of his views."
29:07;29:11;"He's described himself as a center-right fiscal conservative, but he's socially liberal."
29:11;29:14;"He supported John Kasich for president in 2016."
29:14;29:15;"All right."
29:15;29:19;"He has expressed some support for Donald Trump and attended his inauguration."
29:19;29:20;"That's big support."
29:20;29:22;"Go to the inauguration?"
29:22;29:23;"But why was the show canceled?"
29:23;29:26;"I mean, you can make shows about people that are--"
29:26;29:30;"On his show, he called Obama a dictator and wanted to call him a communist."
29:30;29:31;"Oh, but the show was brought back."
29:31;29:34;"I never understood the Obama as dictator thing from the right."
29:34;29:35;"It's just always--"
29:35;29:36;"Yeah, I mean--"
29:36;29:37;"Nothing about him--"
29:37;29:39;"What the-- that's just what it was like."
29:39;29:40;"What the f*** are you talking about?"
29:40;29:41;"Right."
29:41;29:44;"Like, do you mean Obama wants to, like, never leave office?"
29:44;29:46;"Is that what you mean by dictator?"
29:46;29:47;"Yeah."
29:47;29:48;"Obama just--"
29:48;29:51;"I think they meant, like, oh, he wants to-- he's trying to put health care for everyone and, like,"
29:51;29:56;"dictate large sort of social policies that everyone has to adhere to, but not even."
29:56;29:58;"Yeah, that's crazy."
29:58;30:00;"But why was Tim-- whatever, we're talking about Tim Allen's show."
30:00;30:01;"I don't know."
30:01;30:06;"I mean, my larger point is you should be able to make shows about people that are Trump supporters."
30:06;30:08;"You can make a show about that."
30:08;30:14;"That should be a valid thing to make a show about, considering, what, a third or 40% of the country is on board."
30:14;30:16;"Well, look what happened to Roseanne, though."
30:16;30:19;"I mean, that could have been a cool show if she didn't wild out on Twitter."
30:19;30:20;"I mean, I didn't see the show, but, like--"
30:20;30:22;"This is the time crisis take on Roseanne."
30:22;30:24;"This is the media corner."
30:24;30:25;"But that's coming back, too."
30:25;30:26;"Classic, two months too late."
30:26;30:28;"Wait, what do you mean it's coming back? Without her?"
30:28;30:31;"It's called The Conners. It's coming out-- it's just about the family."
30:31;30:32;"Is John Goodman on it?"
30:32;30:35;"I think so. Yeah, I think it's everybody but Roseanne."
30:35;30:38;"So that'll be popular for, like, two weeks and then just take a nose dive."
30:38;30:42;"Is there some artistic reason to, like, dig into that?"
30:42;30:43;"I mean, because, like, look, if you--"
30:43;30:44;"I guess-- yeah."
30:44;30:48;"If you had somebody in your family who was, like, a big Trump supporter and you're not--"
30:48;30:49;"I did."
30:49;30:50;"Oh, really?"
30:50;30:52;"Yeah, my aunt was a huge supporter, and then she died."
30:52;30:53;"My brother Dave."
30:53;30:57;"She went into a coma the day after the election and then died shortly thereafter."
30:57;30:58;"Damn, I didn't know that."
30:58;30:59;"Yeah, man."
30:59;31:03;"But she was really stressed that the election would be stolen from Trump."
31:03;31:08;"And she was so intense and, like, already in terrible health to begin with."
31:08;31:12;"And we don't know what happened, but, like, the day after the election that he won--"
31:12;31:13;"Yeah."
31:13;31:15;"--she, like, went into a coma and then died a few weeks later."
31:15;31:18;"But she and my uncle got in this huge fight on Facebook."
31:18;31:19;"These are siblings."
31:19;31:20;"Yes, yes."
31:20;31:21;"Not husband and wife."
31:21;31:22;"No, no, no, no."
31:22;31:26;"My mom's older sister, now deceased, and my mom's younger brother, Ted--"
31:26;31:27;"Yeah."
31:27;31:29;"--who lives in Pasadena, comes to all our shows."
31:29;31:31;"Oh, yeah, and he's a crunchy dude, loves rock and roll."
31:31;31:35;"They got into a crazy fight about Trump on Facebook, which is just classic."
31:35;31:36;"Right."
31:36;31:37;"Ended on a poor note."
31:37;31:39;"It's an emo story."
31:39;31:42;"Like, their last contact was fighting about Trump."
31:42;31:43;"Then Trump wins."
31:43;31:44;"Janie goes into a coma."
31:44;31:45;"That's it."
31:45;31:46;"That's heavy."
31:46;31:47;"Very."
31:47;31:48;"That is the shit that people always talk--"
31:48;31:50;"I've never, like, fully related to--"
31:50;31:52;"maybe because my family's, like, kind of small."
31:52;31:53;"Hmm."
31:53;31:54;"Or, like, my--"
31:54;31:58;"Like, I did have cousins and uncles in places like California and Texas,"
31:58;32:02;"but my family, as noted on the program, is not big into travel."
32:02;32:04;"So we're, like, pretty posted up."
32:04;32:06;"We were pretty posted up in the tri-state."
32:06;32:10;"And, you know, within my main family generationally,"
32:10;32:13;"like, grandparents and parents and stuff,"
32:13;32:17;"everybody's, like, you know, pretty classically old school New York Jewish liberals."
32:17;32:18;"Right."
32:18;32:24;"Like, you know, great uncle was in the Communist Party when he was a student at CUNY."
32:24;32:27;"That's just, like, such a common story for people from that era."
32:27;32:28;"Sure."
32:28;32:33;"And the concept of my aunt and uncle got into a crazy debate on Facebook--"
32:33;32:34;"Siblings, yeah."
32:34;32:35;"--about Trump."
32:35;32:38;"That's the shit that I always hear about, but I'm always kind of like--"
32:38;32:40;"Yeah, my mom's family was always really split."
32:40;32:43;"My mom and her younger brother Ted were always Dems--"
32:43;32:47;"or Ted, like, super kind of, like, lefty, Ralph Nader kind of dude."
32:47;32:52;"And then my mom's older siblings were, like, hard Republicans."
32:52;32:55;"I wonder if that happens more or less now."
32:55;32:58;"Like, I wonder if there's just something different about these times"
32:58;33:02;"that, like, a group of kids from a family tend not to diverge quite as much."
33:02;33:04;"I bet that's maybe the case."
33:04;33:08;"Like, I could picture there's, like, a family, two brothers,"
33:08;33:11;"both played soccer at the local high school, and just one's like,"
33:11;33:15;"""I'm a Trump guy. He likes Elizabeth Warren."" You know?"
33:15;33:18;"It must happen, and it could--I mean, people are complicated."
33:18;33:22;"It could be, like, so much of a product of the psychology of your role in the family"
33:22;33:27;"or, like, people just, like, get into ideologies and worldviews"
33:27;33:32;"for mysterious reasons, whether it's innate or whether it's, like,"
33:32;33:35;"yeah, you felt always, like, ostracized from your family"
33:35;33:36;"and your family's, like--"
33:36;33:37;"For whatever reason."
33:37;33:38;"For just to be a contrarian."
33:38;33:39;"Yeah, just to be a contrarian."
33:39;33:42;"It's like that guy Stephen Miller who works for Trump."
33:42;33:44;"You know, I know people went to high school with him."
33:44;33:46;"Right. He's from Santa Monica, right?"
33:46;33:47;"What do they say about him?"
33:47;33:48;"He's from Santa Monica."
33:48;33:51;"Well, you can read about this. A lot of people have talked about it."
33:51;33:54;"He, even in high school--because even when I went to college,"
33:54;33:57;"I'd meet people who went to Santa Monica High School, also known as Sam-O-High."
33:57;33:58;"Uh-huh."
33:58;34:01;"And, yeah, the people you would meet were just, like, what you'd expect--"
34:01;34:04;"California, lefties, intellectual types."
34:04;34:08;"So I think he always prided himself on, like, being like, ""Fuck this."""
34:08;34:09;"Yeah."
34:09;34:10;"He was angry about it."
34:10;34:12;"And then you'd read these interviews with his parents where they're kind of like--"
34:12;34:14;"it's not like he was raised by, you know--"
34:14;34:15;"Hippies."
34:15;34:19;"Hippies, but they were kind of like, ""Yeah, we're pretty classic, like, democratic family."""
34:19;34:20;"Right."
34:20;34:22;"I feel like the armchair psychology on that one checks out pretty well."
34:22;34:23;"Yeah."
34:23;34:24;"But, again, no, I'm interested in this."
34:24;34:27;"If anybody--any TC heads come from a family--"
34:27;34:31;"and I'm not talking about aunt and uncle, but, like, siblings--"
34:31;34:38;"same generation, not a major age difference, just having, like, hardcore, differing political views."
34:38;34:39;"Now."
34:40;34:43;"I bet some other podcast or radio show did this two and a half years ago."
34:43;34:44;"Yeah."
34:44;34:45;"This American life."
34:45;34:48;"Also, I feel like, obviously, it's more of a deal-breaker now."
34:48;34:49;"Oh, yeah."
34:49;34:51;"Like, in the '80s, you can imagine somebody being like--"
34:51;34:54;"even though, again, there were really harsh elements of it then--"
34:54;34:57;"I'm not trying to say that the differences are worse now--"
34:57;35:00;"but, yeah, you just imagine somebody being like, ""You're voting for Reagan?"
35:00;35:01;"Come on, man."
35:01;35:03;"Hey, I like what the guy's got to say."
35:03;35:04;"Okay."""
35:04;35:05;"Yeah."
35:06;35:09;"Decide now."
35:18;35:21;"Decide now before you continue."
35:21;35:25;"The list is complete without your permission."
35:25;35:27;"I finally know."
35:27;35:30;"I finally get it."
35:30;35:33;"Ancient ideas are worth fighting for."
35:45;35:46;"Yeah."
35:46;35:48;"The road has been set."
35:48;35:50;"The night screams."
35:50;35:52;"The content you feel."
35:52;35:54;"A musky vagina."
35:54;35:56;"A musk bust of victory."
36:06;36:32;"Around you my love."
36:32;36:35;"I mean, my parents' siblings were all on both sides--my mom and my dad--"
36:35;36:36;"all was Republican."
36:36;36:38;"And I always thought it was maybe because of the '60s."
36:38;36:39;"Yeah."
36:39;36:46;"Because my parents' older siblings were too old to be hip to the changes of the '60s"
36:46;36:48;"in the most time-life sort of way."
36:48;36:49;"Right."
36:49;36:50;"They didn't listen to Bob Dylan."
36:50;36:53;"Didn't smoke weed, didn't listen to Dylan, didn't protest the Vietnam War."
36:53;36:54;"Right."
36:54;36:57;"And my parents were of that perfect generation."
36:57;37:01;"And then my mom's younger brother was a punk in the '70s."
37:01;37:05;"Of course, he's in that post-1960s worldview."
37:05;37:09;"And then the older siblings were very 1950s."
37:09;37:10;"Right."
37:10;37:14;"But then on my dad's side, by the time Obama came around, his older siblings were like,"
37:14;37:15;"""Yeah, we're not."""
37:15;37:17;"They voted for Reagan and Bush and W."
37:17;37:18;"Yeah."
37:18;37:19;"And then they were like, ""Yeah, we're out."""
37:19;37:24;"I could almost picture that where someone's like, ""Well, listen, I was 14 in 2008 when"
37:24;37:29;"Obama was elected, and there was a real sense of excitement."
37:29;37:33;"We were listening to Lil Wayne and MGMT, didn't have a care in the world."""
37:33;37:38;"But then my younger brother, he was 14 in 2016."
37:38;37:40;"Way harsher on social media."
37:40;37:44;"He ended up getting into some weird subreddits."
37:44;37:46;"Lil Wayne wasn't releasing as much music."
37:46;37:51;"And yeah, he really came up in a very different world, and I think it kind of warped his brain."
37:51;37:53;"I could honestly believe that."
37:53;37:55;"It sounds ridiculous, but yeah."
37:55;38:00;"Yeah, we're just a little too old to like, because I was in my 20s through all that to"
38:00;38:02;"fully appreciate the..."
38:02;38:03;"I can't wait for that."
38:03;38:08;"It's like you already find that people make fun of memes that are about 90s kids, because"
38:08;38:10;"90s kids are becoming kind of passe."
38:10;38:14;"Because there always used to be these memes that are just like, ""Only 90s kids remember."""
38:14;38:16;"And it was this exciting thing to reminisce about the 90s."
38:16;38:18;"And what was it like to be a child in the 90s?"
38:18;38:21;"And now it's hitting that place where it's like, ""You're a 90s kid?"
38:21;38:23;"You're 28 years old."
38:23;38:24;"Get your shit together."""
38:24;38:25;"Right."
38:25;38:29;"Where as soon it's going to be some like crazy shit where in two years, people who are 20..."
38:29;38:30;"Okay."
38:30;38:33;"So 20 and 2018."
38:33;38:35;"Let's say 20 and 2020."
38:35;38:36;"Okay, so you're born in 2000."
38:36;38:38;"Then you're born in 2000."
38:38;38:46;"That means that you are 14 in 2014, six years after Obama was elected, six years after the"
38:46;38:48;"first Vampire Weekend album came out."
38:48;38:50;"So you're 14 in 2014."
38:50;38:51;"Like, it seems so random."
38:51;38:57;"So like, what were you taking in in that moment, culturally, politically?"
38:57;38:58;"You're going to have..."
38:58;39:01;"The 90s kids are going to be like baby boomers to you."
39:01;39:02;"Right."
39:02;39:09;"All right, let's say that on February 20th, 2020, we'll do a 20 year olds TC Town Hall."
39:09;39:11;"Kind of get the pulse of the streets."
39:11;39:12;"Love that."
39:12;39:41;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
40:10;40:38;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
40:38;41:07;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
41:07;41:14;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
41:14;41:22;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
41:22;41:31;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
41:31;41:59;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
41:59;42:28;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
48:16;48:38;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
48:38;49:06;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
49:06;49:35;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
56:50;57:18;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
57:46;58:15;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
58:15;58:25;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
58:35;59:03;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
59:03;59:32;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
59:32;59:42;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
59:52;01:00:20;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
01:00:20;01:00:30;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
01:00:40;01:01:00;"I say he's so sweet, think I want to let the rap out."
01:36:40;01:36:42;"I ain't afraid of no ghost."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"I didn't know that much about Ray Parker."
01:36:44;01:36:48;"This song dwarfed everything else that he did in the larger cultural imagination."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"But he's like a really respected guitarist."
01:36:51;01:36:52;"Right."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Was he on some of the MJ records?"
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Maybe not."
01:36:55;01:36:59;"I don't know about being on Michael Jackson, but in terms of like late 70s, early 80s funk,"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"he was like a go-to guy, played on important records."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"He had his own group called Radio."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"And I think he ended up maybe playing a little bit on the last Chromio album."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"Dave was telling me about hanging out with him."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"Just like this amazing guitarist."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"He still has his own studio in the Valley."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"He's like a producer too."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Oh yeah, I think he mentioned this one time on the show."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Yeah."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Shout out to Ray Parker Jr."
01:37:16;01:37:20;"This ectocontainment system Spengler and I have in mind is going to cost a load of bread"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"to capitalize."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Where are we going to get the money?"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"I don't know."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"A load of bread?"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Who says that?"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Ackroyd says that to Murray."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"Yeah."
01:37:28;01:37:32;"This ectocontainment system that Spengler and I have in mind is going to cost a load"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"of bread to capitalize."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"How many times do you think you've seen Ghostbusters?"
01:37:35;01:37:36;"80."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Oh, shit."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"I have no idea."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"I mean, it's one of those, you know when you're a kid,"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"and maybe you didn't have this experience."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"You watch the same video over and over again."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"Yeah."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Or like we'd rent a video on a Friday night."
01:37:45;01:37:48;"We'd watch the movie, and then the next morning, just watch it again."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"Right."
01:37:49;01:37:55;"And then we had Ghostbusters and probably watched that like once a week for like years."
01:37:55;01:37:59;"And then in high school, like me and a few buddies all had it memorized."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Right."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"So it just was like constant."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Did you ever work to memorize it?"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"No."
01:38:04;01:38:08;"But see, if you're riffing on the movie with your buddies, and then they're saying lines,"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"then that makes you remember even more."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Right."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"And actually, my high school yearbook quote was from Ghostbusters."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"What was it?"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"""Slow down."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"Chew your food."""
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Who says that?"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"Venkman."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"To a ghost?"
01:38:19;01:38:20;"No, he says it to Ackroyd."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"It's like right when the business is getting off the ground,"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"and they're just like wailing on Chinese food,"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"and they're like stressed about the business not taking off."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"It's before the ghosts have like taken over Manhattan."
01:38:30;01:38:31;"Right."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"And Ackroyd's just like stressed out and eating, and then Venkman's just like,"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"""Hey, hey, slow down."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Chew your food."""
01:38:35;01:38:36;"That's Bill Murray."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"So did you quote it as--"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Dr. Peter Venkman."
01:38:40;01:38:41;"Dr. Venkman."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"But you know what?"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"It's like a throwaway line in the movie."
01:38:44;01:38:47;"It's a very subtle, slightly humorous line in the movie."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"It's not like an iconic line."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"But as a high school yearbook quote, it goes deep."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I mean, it's great advice."
01:38:54;01:38:55;"Right, yeah."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Slow down. Chew your food."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"It's multi-layered."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"And actually, I've kind of lived my life by that credo."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Really?"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"I can't believe we never got into this before."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"Slow down. Chew your food."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"I mean, it's just like it's all good."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Slow down."
01:39:06;01:39:10;"And that's specific advice for when you're in a stressful situation?"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"Yeah, it's literal advice on how to eat properly."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Right."
01:39:14;01:39:17;"But it's also--yeah, it's like a philosophical outlook, right?"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Slow down. Chew your food."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Don't flip out."
01:39:19;01:39:20;"Don't stress out."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Take your time."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Think it through."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"Be patient."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"It's a little bit like, ""Don't sweat the small stuff."""
01:39:25;01:39:28;"Then in parentheses, it's all small stuff."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"Yeah, it's kind of like that."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"But it's funnier."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"It's very zen, too."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"For sure."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"I think I've referenced this on the show."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"Like these zen comics I had as a kid that would tell--"
01:39:36;01:39:42;"using the language of comic books--kind of tell classic stories about zen monks"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"and how they reached enlightenment."
01:39:43;01:39:48;"And, you know, the story is they always go to the master all hyper, stressed out."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"""I need to figure out how to do this. Show me how to do this."""
01:39:50;01:39:53;"And the master--and this also happens in kung fu movies all the time."
01:39:53;01:39:56;"The master's like, ""Okay, go do that simple task. Go sweep up."""
01:39:56;01:39:57;"And he's like, ""What?"""
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Wax on, wax off."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"You know what? I actually think of movies that I've seen--"
01:40:00;01:40:03;"I don't think I've seen anything 80 times, but maybe like 20 times."
01:40:03;01:40:10;"My dad had a VHS of this kung fu movie called Return of the Master Killer with Gordon Liu."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Don't know it."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"It's like, you know, that--"
01:40:13;01:40:14;"'70s?"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"It's definitely '70s."
01:40:15;01:40:20;"In New York, they always showed kung fu movies on Channel 5."
01:40:20;01:40:24;"It was like this thing, Channel 5 movies, you know, with the terrible dubbing and stuff."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"And there's a lot of movies like this."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"But in Return of the Master Killer specifically,"
01:40:27;01:40:32;"there's like this con man who gets run out of town, and he ends up at the Shaolin Temple,"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"and he really wants to learn to do kung fu."
01:40:34;01:40:38;"And the master's basically like, ""No, dude. I'm not ready to teach you."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"But you know what? We could use some scaffolding around the place."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"Why don't you help us put up scaffolding?"
01:40:42;01:40:47;"Go take the big, long things of bamboo, tie them up with some straw or whatever,"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"and, you know, put up scaffolding."""
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Then he's like pissed or whatever, and he's like, ""Fine."""
01:40:51;01:40:53;"Years go by, he's putting up the scaffolding."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Little by little, he's like getting used to it."
01:40:55;01:40:59;"He's like kicking up a bamboo pole with his foot and then grabbing it in the air and putting it--"
01:40:59;01:41:05;"And then it's like this whole thing that by the end of it, he has become this like sick fighter."
01:41:05;01:41:10;"And then he comes back to the town he got run out of, and he beats up all like the bad dudes,"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"and he's doing all this like crazy scaffolding sh*t,"
01:41:13;01:41:17;"like using the pole to beat the sh*t out of people, and then like tying their hands behind their back."
01:41:17;01:41:21;"And it's like that same thing of just like, ""Yeah, chill out. Focus on simple tasks."""
01:41:21;01:41:24;"And, you know, slow and steady wins the race, kind of."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"I guess there's a lot of adjacent--"
01:41:25;01:41:26;"Tortoise and the hare."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Tortoise and the hare. Yeah."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Like nobody benefits from freaking out."
01:41:30;01:41:34;"Control the things you can. Focus on what's right in front of you, too."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"You know what my high school yearbook quote was?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"I don't."
01:41:36;01:41:40;"We talked about this. It was, ""Do you love me? Do you, surfer girl?"""
01:41:40;01:41:41;"[laughter]"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Which I credited to Brian Wilson."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Of course you did."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"Upon reflection, I don't even know if he necessarily wrote the lyric."
01:41:47;01:41:51;"Yeah, I think I wrote, ""Do you love me? Do you, dot dot dot, surfer girl?"""
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Question mark."
01:41:52;01:41:55;"It probably would have been more appropriate, ""Do you, comma, surfer girl?"""
01:41:55;01:41:59;"There's something about the dot dot-- I've always just found like, lipsies funny."
01:41:59;01:42:02;"""Do you, dot dot dot, surfer girl?"""
01:42:02;01:42:05;"So were you doing it as like, pure joke? Or was it like--"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"No, yeah, I don't think--"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"I love the beach-- Brian Wilson's a genius."
01:42:08;01:42:12;"No, I don't think-- I wasn't even like much of a beach boy's head at that time."
01:42:12;01:42:18;"And there's definitely no like, double meaning like with yours where it actually is kind of good advice and whatever."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I think I just found it like, random and funny."
01:42:20;01:42:23;"""Do you love me? Do you, surfer girl?"""
01:42:23;01:42:26;"The number two song in '77, ""Frampton."""
01:42:26;01:42:30;"So far we got Sean Cassidy, Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Peter Frampton."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"All right, Peter Frampton's the hardest."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"""Ooh, baby, I love your way."""
01:42:34;01:42:36;"No, it's ""I'm in you."""
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Oh."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Raw."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Rough stuff."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"Rough stuff, folks."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"I'm not mad at this."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"Yeah, I've never heard this."
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Kind of Lennon."
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Oh, that's so Lennon."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"The vocal is so low in the mix."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Weird."
01:43:58;01:44:00;"Top five for '77."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"The number one song, yeah, this has been very lopsided."
01:44:03;01:44:06;"So now we're at the number one for my year '84."
01:44:06;01:44:10;"""What's Love Got to Do With It?"" Tina Turner, ""State of Shock,"" The Jacksons, featuring Mick Jagger."
01:44:10;01:44:13;"""Dancing in the Dark,"" Bruce, ""Ghostbusters,"" Ray Parker Jr."
01:44:13;01:44:17;"Number one, ""Prince and the Revolution."""
01:44:17;01:44:18;"Okay."
01:44:20;01:44:24;"It's like everything had those hard '80s drums."
01:44:24;01:44:27;"""State of Shock,"" ""Dancing in the Dark."""
01:44:28;01:44:33;"And the hits that were hits then remained relevant timeless hits."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"I mean, the hits of '77 is just like--"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"Was anyone in 1984 listening to any of those songs from '77?"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Hell no."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"Not these guys."
01:45:01;01:45:05;"Yeah, I always wished Prince made records in like 1972."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"He would have been doing some cool [bleep]"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"I mean, his late '70s stuff is--"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Yeah, that's probably my favorite Prince."
01:45:11;01:45:14;"The production of this era just doesn't--"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Never warm to it."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Right."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"You're a '70s guy."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"I'm a total '70s guy."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"The songwriter's great."
01:45:21;01:45:25;"Well, for being such like an idiosyncratic, kind of like funky dude,"
01:45:25;01:45:29;"like, this production is not serving his vibe."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Oh, very highly debatable."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"I know it is."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"That's what this show is all about."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"Crossfire."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"I've always thought that."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"If you could transplant Prince's career 10 years earlier,"
01:45:39;01:45:42;"the catalog would be so much more fierce."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"That's my time machine theory."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Right, but he helped create part of that sound."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"It's like very stylized."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"[Makes sound effects]"
01:45:50;01:45:55;"You know, when you think of a song later in the '80s like ""Kiss,"""
01:45:55;01:45:56;"[Makes sound effects]"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"But it's like hard to imagine that song any other way."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"It's like--"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"Yeah."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"But also one thing I'll say about this '84 playlist,"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"it's like a state of shock in Ghostbusters."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"I was going to say they're not very dark,"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"but I guess Ghostbusters is kind of dark."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Imagine your whole neighborhood getting taken over by ghosts."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"That's kind of dark."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"But if you look at like the big three songs,"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Tina Turner, ""What's Love Got to Do With It,"""
01:46:17;01:46:20;"it's like also kind of on this like worn out existential vibe."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"""What's Love But a Second Hand Emotion,"""
01:46:22;01:46:25;"like polar opposite of like the '70s schmaltz."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Even the heartbreak stuff in the '70s was different"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"than essentially being like does love mean anything?"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"We're adults."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"We're in this relationship."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"We've got to be pragmatic here."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Right."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"And then Bruce dancing in the dark,"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"just like also kind of desperate and worn out."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"Like, hey, listen, I'll take anything."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"A classic Bruce theme."
01:46:45;01:46:48;"What's that song from ""Tunnel of Love""?"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Boom, boom, boom, boom."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"Oh, ""Tougher Than the Rest""?"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Yeah."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Well, it's Saturday night."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Right."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"It's like a classic Bruce thing that's kind of like"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"not a lot of ego."
01:46:57;01:47:01;"Like, listen, I'm nothing special, but I'm here now."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"I'm the guy at the bar tonight."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Yeah."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Just you and me."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"So the Tina and the Bruce song are both like"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"grizzled adult songs."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"It's not about like youthful love or just like"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"the drama of heartbreak."
01:47:12;01:47:15;"It's almost like some realistic just like life's f---ed up."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"Bruce was 34."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"He was born in 1950?"
01:47:17;01:47:18;"Yeah."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Tina was 44."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"And then you get Prince."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Just some middle-aged adults."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Prince younger, but even Prince is on some like existential"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"like talking to your therapist s---."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"That's also like when Dove's Cry doesn't get enough credit"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"for that."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"It's like there's been a lot of hit songs you could call"
01:47:31;01:47:35;"existential, but the Prince song is like straight up"
01:47:35;01:47:36;"Freudian, you know?"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Like even though whatever."
01:47:38;01:47:41;"I'm not sure if I'm tapped in on the meaning of when Dove's Cry."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"I'm just saying the fact that I know like we take it for"
01:47:43;01:47:47;"granted now that your parents have a big impact on who you are."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"Right."
01:47:48;01:47:51;"But you know, like all ideas, that was a conceptual idea"
01:47:51;01:47:55;"that came up through multiple people and became mainstream"
01:47:55;01:47:58;"only truly, truly mainstream only say like in our parents'"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"lifetime."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Mm-hmm."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"Even if people had an inkling that their family dynamic"
01:48:03;01:48:06;"shaped who they were, they would have only obliquely"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"referenced it, you know?"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"Right, right."
01:48:08;01:48:09;"There's not a lot of cowboy song."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Well, there's like Mama Tried."
01:48:11;01:48:14;"But so I just think to have a number one hit song where"
01:48:14;01:48:17;"somebody says, maybe I'm just like my father."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"He's never satisfied."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"Maybe I'm just like my mother."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Why do we scream at each other?"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"I'm sure some--"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Yeah, those are cool lyrics."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"I'm sure people have pointed this out before, but that's"
01:48:26;01:48:30;"literally-- that might be one of the most like therapized"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"big hit songs."
01:48:31;01:48:34;"It's literally somebody saying, me and my partner are"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"fighting a lot."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"I want to actually take a step back."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"I'm not sure why we're always screaming at each other."
01:48:38;01:48:41;"Maybe I need to take a step back, examine my family of"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"origin and my relationship to my mother and my father."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Like that's some heavy psych shit."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"And like, so I'm just saying like we got at least three"
01:48:47;01:48:51;"songs, four if you count Ghostbusters, that are dealing"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"with kind of like heavy psychological shit in '84."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"Ghostbusters is touching the etheric plane."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"It's the paranormal."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"It's going beyond human experience."
01:49:01;01:49:05;"What was Ghostbusters, if not a parable about childhood"
01:49:05;01:49:09;"trauma coming back to haunt damaged adults?"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"An entire city."
01:49:10;01:49:14;"Yeah, on a grand scale, an entire city reckoning with--"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Well, that is the premise of Ghostbusters 2."
01:49:16;01:49:21;"All the negative energy and emotions in the city were"
01:49:21;01:49:26;"metastasized and congealed into this river of slime under"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"the city."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"All the psychic energy, all the psychic turbulence."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Right."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"So there's honestly-- and I'll throw State of Shock in there"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"too."
01:49:33;01:49:36;"Five songs in the top five in summer '84 that were about"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"psychic energy."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"It was a great top five."
01:49:39;01:49:44;"'77 was rough stuff, folks."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"What's number one in '77?"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"The number one song--"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Hotel California?"
01:49:47;01:49:52;"Hotel California in Jake's first summer on spaceship Earth"
01:49:52;01:49:55;"was Andy Gibb, ""I Just Want to Be Your Everything."""
01:49:55;01:49:56;"Wow."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"At least it was a consistent top five."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"It was very consistent."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"Before I even play, I just want to say-- to go back,"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"I won't even say the artist, but the titles of the top five"
01:50:04;01:50:08;"summer '77, ""Da Du Ron Ron,"" ""My Heart Belongs to Me,"""
01:50:08;01:50:11;"""Looks Like We Made It,"" ""I'm In You,"" ""I Just Want to Be"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Your Everything."""
01:50:12;01:50:13;"Wow."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"At least ""Da Du Ron Ron"" is some weirdo [BLEEP]"
01:50:15;01:50:18;"whereas '84, ""When Doves Cry,"" ""Ghostbusters,"""
01:50:18;01:50:19;"""Dancing in the Dark."""
01:50:19;01:50:20;"It's just so funny."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"Yeah."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"Anyway, so here's the number one song."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Crazy how consistent."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Those are two very pure top fives."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"Yeah."
01:50:29;01:50:32;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR EVERYTHING""]"
01:50:32;01:50:33;"I don't care."
01:50:33;01:50:38;"I'm blown away how consistently innocuous and forgettable"
01:50:38;01:50:43;"this '77 top-- this might be the worst top five ever"
01:50:43;01:50:44;"that we've done."
01:50:44;01:50:47;"There's not even a cool disco song thrown in to break it up."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"Nothing is up-tempo."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Right."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"I mean, ""Du Ron Ron"" is the best one."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"And it sucked."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Yeah."
01:50:55;01:51:00;"And also, this is July '77."
01:51:00;01:51:04;"There weren't cool, dancey, funk and disco songs."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"Or even like, yeah, Fleetwood Mac, Eagles."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"I was playing with Peter Frampton again."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"I didn't even notice."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR EVERYTHING""]"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"This is Andy Gibb."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"The songs are so similar."
01:51:17;01:51:21;"They both start with like, a string pad or a selena"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"or something."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"This has got a little more tooth to it."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR EVERYTHING""]"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"Maybe not."
01:51:27;01:51:32;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR EVERYTHING""]"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"That's some solid guitar work."
01:51:34;01:51:38;"Nothing off the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Nothing off ""Rumors."""
01:51:39;01:51:42;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""RUMORS""]"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"It's always nice when a Gibb gets up high like that."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"Yep."
01:52:10;01:52:13;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""RUMORS""]"
01:52:13;01:52:34;"You think he's just harmonizing with himself there?"
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Because you have the Gibb brothers in there."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"His brothers came through?"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"Depends on their family dynamic."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"They were not supportive of this Andy Gibb solo album."
01:52:43;01:52:44;"[LAUGHS]"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"[MUSIC - ANDY GIBB, ""RUMORS""]"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Barry was upset."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Do you know that this is a keyboard from the '70s, the selena?"
01:52:50;01:52:51;"No."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"It was kind of like, originally marketed--"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"and I can't say for sure that's a selena."
01:52:55;01:52:56;"My ear's not good enough for it."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"But the cool thing about it is it was this keyboard that"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"was kind of marketed as like, fake strings."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"But that's like, a lot of '70s stuff that doesn't use strings"
01:53:04;01:53:05;"and uses selena."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"It's just like, kind of also very eerie."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"It's almost like Lynch."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"Yes."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"Like a David Lynch kind of tone."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"So it was used a lot on like, schmaltzy stuff"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"to basically be a cheap way to not have to hire a keyboard"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"to be like, [HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK]"
01:53:17;01:53:20;"But then, one of the most classic usages of it,"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"which is like, very interesting to picture these guys--"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I wonder what their whole attitude towards this keyboard"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"was, if they were like, oh, that's hilarious."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"That's like, that cheesy keyboard you hear on pop music."
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Or they didn't even have that context."
01:53:30;01:53:31;"They were like, it just sounds cool."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"It's this."
01:53:35;01:53:47;"Oh, OK."
01:53:50;01:53:55;"Like, that's the same keyboard you get on a lot of like,"
01:53:55;01:53:56;"really schmaltzy--"
01:53:56;01:53:57;"Wow."
01:53:57;01:54:00;"Because it was originally sold as a strings replacement."
01:54:00;01:54:03;"So you think there's possible they were kind of ironically"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"riffing on like, schmaltzy production,"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"or it was just like, someone's brother had one,"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"and they were just like, let's try that out."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Yeah, or they were just like, we need a keyboard on this song."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"What would be cool?"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"They're like, well, how about this one?"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"Oh, what's that?"
01:54:15;01:54:16;"Oh, that's weird."
01:54:16;01:54:19;"Because also, it's like, growing up, when we did, of course,"
01:54:19;01:54:22;"I hear it in that context, and I'm like, that's the origin."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"What year is that?"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"'80?"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"I think '80."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"Oh, wow."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Or maybe it was probably-- it might have been recorded in '79."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"You get a number crunch sound, Phil?"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"I mean, they use it in such a different way."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"It's so like, stark and minimal."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Yeah, that's the thing."
01:54:35;01:54:38;"On the schmaltzy '70s stuff, they probably even would double it"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"with real strings sometimes."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"Right."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"So it would just be this--"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Folds."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"I wonder if they use it on like, Dreamweaver."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Oh, totally, dude."
01:54:44;01:54:47;"But yeah, there's something-- when you just hear it up there"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"by itself, it's like, truly haunting and weird."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"And it's not trying to mimic a string section."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Yeah."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"It's truly like, a standalone, weird sound."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"How hilarious would that song be if it just like,"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"beautiful '70s strings came in?"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"[HUMMING]"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"Like a full orchestra."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"June 1980."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"So that dropped June 1980."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"Sick."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Anyway, that's the old Selena keyboard."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"That was an interesting top five."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"It was."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"Comparison-- you know, there's nothing wrong with the shows"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"where we step out of time."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Yeah, worked out great."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"And I think that--"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"Don't have to be topical."
01:55:21;01:55:24;"I think the TC heads understand that we're not always"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"going to be right in the middle of the hot button"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"issues of the day."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"And you know, sometimes we record a couple weeks early,"
01:55:30;01:55:31;"and this is the vibe."
01:55:31;01:55:34;"There might be a lot of this upcoming in the next year"
01:55:34;01:55:35;"to 18 months."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Right, that's true."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"I mean, if we're looking ahead here--"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"Going to be in and dipping in and out a lot."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"Yeah."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Life on the road."
01:55:42;01:55:46;"All right, another TC in the-- what would you say?"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"In the bag?"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"In the box?"
01:55:48;01:55:49;"On the books?"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"In the book?"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"In the can?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"In the can."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"That's the most appropriate."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"On the hard drive."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Peace."
