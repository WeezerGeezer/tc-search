00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, a very, very special episode."
00:04;00:10;"We're joined in person by Winter, the god of starbucking."
00:10;00:16;"We'll also be joined by Merc, the guy who got savaged by Walmart on Twitter."
00:16;00:21;"All this, plus Dave Long's dearth of dirty projectors, in the studio."
00:21;00:23;"This is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:27;00:31;"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-sport one."
00:32;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:38;00:45;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:45;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:10;01:14;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:14;01:17;"Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:17;01:18;"Hey."
01:18;01:20;"Been seeing a lot of each other in between the shows lately."
01:20;01:23;"It's true. Sometimes it's nothing."
01:23;01:28;"Sometimes it's like no contact, not seeing each other, hard two weeks."
01:28;01:31;"Recently, there's been a lot of hangouts."
01:31;01:34;"We've been doing multiple Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures shows."
01:34;01:36;"Right, this week was huge."
01:36;01:39;"This week was huge. That's a tradition we're definitely going to keep going."
01:39;01:41;"I can't wait to start doing those outside of California."
01:41;01:43;"Dude, we're on board."
01:43;01:51;"Yeah, I don't want to over-promise, but if I can, I want to be taking Richard Pictures to London, New York."
01:51;01:52;"Love the idea."
01:52;01:53;"Paris."
01:53;02:01;"As I said to Brian, your TM, tour manager, I don't want to throw around industry lingo that people can't follow."
02:01;02:06;"Your TM, I was like, ""Listen, people have children and jobs."
02:06;02:08;"So we need a couple weeks warning here."
02:08;02:12;"You can't be like, 'Hey, can you guys be in New York tomorrow?'"
02:12;02:14;"That's not going to fly with Richard Pictures."
02:14;02:16;"This is a family band."
02:16;02:18;"People have responsibilities."
02:18;02:21;"But if you give it, you know, ""Hey, two weeks from now, we've got a show."" Boom."
02:21;02:24;"I need a photocopy of everyone's passport."
02:24;02:28;"Oh, our drummer doesn't have a passport. It expired."
02:28;02:31;"Will you guys front the money to rush it?"
02:31;02:34;"We would. We would."
02:34;02:38;"That's a huge part of the music industry is expedited passport processing."
02:38;02:40;"Because people are just flakes."
02:40;02:42;"It ain't cheap."
02:42;02:44;"Or because you get a gig in some country. I don't know."
02:44;02:46;"Right. We need a visa."
02:46;02:52;"Yeah, that's a big part of management is getting on the horn with the State Department sometimes."
02:52;02:55;"Oh, my God. Got to do that Richard Pictures Vampire Weekend show in Brazil."
02:55;02:57;"That would be sick."
02:57;02:59;"I don't know if we need a visa for that."
02:59;03:00;"You know, it would be cool."
03:00;03:02;"I remember once reading an article, I don't know how big they are these days,"
03:02;03:05;"about a Sublime cover band called Bad Fish."
03:05;03:06;"Wow."
03:06;03:09;"Well, because now Sublime is back on the road."
03:09;03:12;"They're called Sublime with Rome because this guy Rome is the new singer."
03:12;03:13;"That's his first name?"
03:13;03:19;"Yeah, but in the interim after Brad died and the other guys were doing like Long Beach Dub All Stars and things like that,"
03:19;03:21;"there was kind of a fertile cover band scene."
03:21;03:25;"And this one Bad Fish got pretty big, starting to play to like thousands of people."
03:25;03:26;"Wow."
03:26;03:30;"Especially on the East Coast, the places where Sublime never really got to tour."
03:30;03:32;"That's kind of surprising."
03:32;03:34;"Sublime was like a SoCal phenomenon."
03:34;03:35;"Yep."
03:35;03:37;"And then this dude, he died in his prime."
03:37;03:38;"Right."
03:38;03:40;"You know, he died before the big album came out."
03:40;03:41;"Yep."
03:41;03:42;"It's a tragic story."
03:42;03:45;"But think about all the places the dead never went."
03:45;03:46;"Right."
03:46;03:47;"The dead barely went to Europe."
03:47;03:48;"Right."
03:48;03:51;"I think outside of that, they played one show like randomly in the Caribbean."
03:51;03:52;"I looked this up once."
03:52;03:54;"Famously, they played in Egypt, in Cairo."
03:54;03:55;"Right."
03:55;03:58;"I don't think the dead ever played Australia, Asia."
03:58;03:59;"Really?"
03:59;04:00;"South America."
04:00;04:01;"Wow."
04:01;04:02;"Yeah, I don't think the dead ever went to Australia."
04:02;04:04;"Was that a thing back then?"
04:04;04:07;"I mean, like were bands, like did Led Zeppelin play Australia?"
04:07;04:08;"The Beatles did."
04:08;04:09;"They must have."
04:09;04:10;"Right."
04:10;04:13;"I remember Vampire Weekend played a show in Melbourne or something."
04:13;04:15;"And I remember them being like, oh, you know, the Beatles played here."
04:15;04:17;"The Beatles might have gone to Australia once."
04:17;04:18;"Remember the Beatles?"
04:18;04:20;"The Beatles would play in like the Philippines."
04:20;04:21;"They did a world tour."
04:21;04:24;"Did the Eagles play Australia in the '70s?"
04:24;04:25;"Hard to say."
04:25;04:26;"But here's one thing I know."
04:26;04:27;"Okay."
04:27;04:30;"The dead did not play Australia, and they definitely never played South America."
04:30;04:36;"So for all you know, you throw out Brazil, maybe there are a lot of nascent deadheads."
04:36;04:38;"They would worship Richard Pictures like gods."
04:38;04:43;"They got to see a 40 minute set before Vampire."
04:44;04:52;"I know you right, gonna miss me when I'm gone."
04:52;05:03;"I know you right, gonna miss me when I'm gone."
05:05;05:14;"Gonna kiss your baby from rolling in your arms."
05:16;05:36;"Lay down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest."
05:38;05:46;"My mind was wandering like wild bees in the west."
05:46;05:53;"Also, another thing that we did was we went to the Dead & Co show together."
05:53;05:54;"That's right."
05:54;05:56;"It's all been building up to this."
05:56;06:00;"Dead, real dead intensive last few months."
06:00;06:01;"Dodger Stadium."
06:01;06:02;"Last few years."
06:02;06:03;"Yeah, Dodger Stadium."
06:03;06:05;"You, me, John from Dick Picks."
06:05;06:09;"And my buddy Chris Fallon, who's sort of like our unofficial tour manager."
06:09;06:10;"Right."
06:10;06:12;"He's not on stage, but he's part of the Richard Pictures family."
06:12;06:13;"He's part of the crew."
06:13;06:15;"So all in all, a great night."
06:15;06:16;"Oh, yeah."
06:16;06:25;"Last time, just for people who don't remember, Jake infamously did not enjoy Dead & Company at Hollywood Bowl."
06:25;06:30;"And there was a video that went semi-viral at a few local Southern California Home Depots"
06:30;06:37;"of Jake saying during the show that John Mayer had no tone, no lyricism, and he was not enjoying the show."
06:37;06:39;"That's where TTL comes from, I think."
06:39;06:40;"Tone, touch, and lyricism."
06:40;06:49;"Yeah, I think the TTL analysis comes from me ripping Mayer a new one on the show circa summer 2017."
06:49;06:53;"Yeah, the three major things that a guitarist needs, tone, touch, and lyricism."
06:53;06:57;"Well, OK, but before we even get into Mayer, paying a picture for the people,"
06:57;07:05;"there is something especially fun about a Dead & Co. show because you know that there's going to be this whole communal sense happening."
07:05;07:06;"Right."
07:06;07:11;"And like it or not, this is the closest you're going to get to the Grateful Dead."
07:11;07:14;"So you get all sorts of people who are vaguely interested in the Dead's music."
07:14;07:16;"We met at a bar."
07:16;07:17;"Right."
07:17;07:18;"It was also incredibly hot, people should know."
07:18;07:20;"Yeah, it was like pushing 100."
07:20;07:24;"We meet up at a bar, slam a few cold ones, then head over to Dodger Stadium."
07:24;07:27;"And it's like slight pandemonium."
07:27;07:28;"So many people."
07:28;07:30;"The lot scene was kind of tight."
07:30;07:38;"Yeah, I mean that mix of like sort of depressing and occasionally interesting and occasionally funny, but mostly kind of depressing."
07:38;07:43;"It's also stressful too because, you know, this is not unique to Dead & Co., this could be at a lot of lot scenes."
07:43;07:50;"When you're rolling through, there's the constant sound of balloons popping from the people selling nitrous."
07:50;07:51;"Right."
07:51;07:55;"And I'm in a situation where there's like really like stressful noises happening over and over."
07:55;07:57;"Makes me think of that scene in Boogie Nights."
07:57;07:58;"Oh my, Cosmo."
07:58;08:02;"He keeps like lighting like little fireworks."
08:02;08:03;"Yeah, firecrackers."
08:03;08:10;"Yeah, so it's a very tense scene and then there's just somebody kind of, ""Sister Christian, you're not only one."""
08:10;08:15;"That's probably what it would have felt like to be on a like a Civil War encampment."
08:15;08:18;"People just from all over the place, different sounds."
08:18;08:20;"Weird food being made."
08:20;08:21;"Weird food."
08:21;08:29;"My buddy, John, who's been a vegetarian for a long time and went to shows in the '90s, was commenting how the lot scene is real meaty now."
08:29;08:35;"A lot of bacon-wrapped dogs, not a lot of kind veggie burritos, not a lot of falafel."
08:35;08:41;"The classic food that people sell on the lot is grilled cheese, veggie burrito."
08:41;08:43;"Right, and he-- yeah, and falafel."
08:43;08:47;"And he found that grilled cheese stand and it was all premixed with bacon."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah."
08:48;08:51;"And he was like, ""Yo, dude, I'm a vegetarian. Can I get just like a straight-up grilled cheese?"""
08:51;08:53;"Like American cheese on white bread."
08:53;08:59;"He's like, ""Dude, I got it all premixed. I got the onions in with the bacon. I got the cheese in with the bacon."""
08:59;09:02;"Like, it was so raw."
09:02;09:04;"I guess that's what's changed."
09:04;09:05;"The dead scene got meaty."
09:05;09:07;"The dead scene got very meaty."
09:07;09:12;"I also feel like when we rolled up to the grilled cheese guy, I vaguely remember this exchange."
09:12;09:17;"I could be misremembering it, but the guy, you know, in the way that sometimes like hippie people,"
09:17;09:23;"they'll be like, you know, just telling you how it is and disappointing you, but still have a little bit of that hippie tone."
09:23;09:28;"And the guy was like, ""Yeah, no, I'm sorry, man. We can't do-- no, no, no, we can't do that."""
09:28;09:31;"And he was like, ""You can't just make me just a regular grilled cheese. You got the cheese."""
09:31;09:34;"""No, man, it's all premixed with bacon."""
09:34;09:41;"And I think John said, ""That sucks."" And the guy goes, ""It does suck."""
09:41;09:43;"Well, how does it not occur to that guy?"
09:43;09:46;"I'm picturing him up at like 6 in the morning, like just prepping."
09:46;09:52;"There's tons of like Ziploc bags full of just like ingredients he prepped the night before."
09:52;09:54;"Man, we should have talked to this guy more."
09:54;09:58;"Maybe he used to roll up to the lot and he did vegetarian and bacon,"
09:58;10:04;"and then he just realized that he was selling-- he was going 70, 30% bacon,"
10:04;10:10;"and he realized that somehow it would make his life easier and get profits up."
10:10;10:14;"If someone's already kind of messed up before the show, they're just like, ""Yeah, bacon."""
10:14;10:18;"Yeah, I mean, I eat meat, but even I'd probably rather just have the chill grilled cheese."
10:18;10:19;"Right."
10:19;10:21;"Also, it's so funny. It was 100 degrees."
10:21;10:24;"Right. Who wants like nasty-ass bacon?"
10:24;10:28;"And then maybe him telling people, ""It does suck,"" is like his go-to thing,"
10:28;10:30;"because maybe he deals-- he's like, ""You know what?"
10:30;10:34;"I'd rather deal with one out of every 20 people disappointed"
10:34;10:37;"than actually have to make two batches of cheese."""
10:37;10:42;"This is where it's confusing. It's not hard to just keep a separate stack of the Kraft singles."
10:42;10:44;"This is going to be forever in the street."
10:44;10:48;"Yeah, what was it? Just like a bucket of cheesy bacon that he was just like slopping onto the things?"
10:48;10:49;"I think so."
10:49;10:52;"I just love that. ""It does suck, man."""
10:52;10:58;"That's classic hippie too, that ingrained sense of the powers that be suck,"
10:58;11:02;"but also a lack of acknowledgement when you are the powers that be."
11:02;11:03;"Right."
11:03;11:04;"You know what I mean?"
11:04;11:07;"I picture some hippie businessman with a big Silicon Valley company being like,"
11:07;11:11;"""Dude, everybody's committing suicide at the factories in China because the wages are so bad."
11:11;11:12;"That sucks."""
11:12;11:15;"""It does suck, man. That's f***ing harsh."""
11:15;11:16;"That's a real shame."
11:16;11:18;"That's brutal, dude."
11:18;11:20;"This season of Silicon Valley, they go into that."
11:20;11:22;"Yeah, there's elements of that for sure."
11:22;11:26;"When Gavin goes to China-- I just watched this last night by coincidence,"
11:26;11:33;"and he's there with his guru dude, and the Chinese CEO dude brings out the children to sing to Gavin."
11:33;11:37;"Gavin's like, ""Yeah, okay. Well, they should be working, okay?"""
11:37;11:40;"But he's just trying to play it off like it's all chill."
11:40;11:41;"I think there's a lot of that."
11:41;11:44;"And you know where it starts? It starts in the lot."
11:44;11:49;"As soon as the hippies start passing the buck, ""Oh, man, I'm a vegetarian."
11:49;11:51;"That kind of sucks. There's no vegetarian options."""
11:51;11:55;"""It does suck, man. It does suck."""
12:56;13:03;"So after that, it was like another classic cluster F trying to get in."
13:03;13:08;"It took-- Okay, let's say this. By the time we got to our ""seats""--"
13:08;13:11;"It had been a solid two-hour odyssey."
13:11;13:14;"Yeah, and the show was like six, seven songs in."
13:14;13:15;"Partially my fault, because I didn't--"
13:15;13:17;"We missed most of the first set."
13:17;13:18;"Yeah."
13:18;13:19;"Which is cool."
13:19;13:20;"It was fine."
13:20;13:21;"Yeah, it doesn't matter."
13:21;13:22;"The second set was better anyway."
13:22;13:25;"We stood on the wrong line for like 40 minutes."
13:25;13:26;"Yeah."
13:26;13:27;"Had a good time, though."
13:27;13:28;"Yeah."
13:28;13:29;"We had to shoot in the breeze."
13:29;13:30;"Because the shrooms were kicking in."
13:30;13:31;"Right."
13:31;13:35;"I want to also make clear on TimeCrafts, we don't condone drug use at all."
13:35;13:38;"Neither Jake nor I are big drug users, period."
13:38;13:39;"No."
13:39;13:40;"But we're not teetotalers either."
13:40;13:41;"Nope."
13:41;13:42;"So we got to the lot."
13:42;13:43;"John rolled in."
13:43;13:44;"Yeah."
13:44;13:47;"Our buddy John rolled in with a 12-pack of beer in his backpack."
13:47;13:50;"And as soon as we stepped foot on Dodger Stadium property,"
13:50;13:53;"he was like, ""Three for one, two for five."""
13:53;13:55;"He was out there selling beers."
13:55;13:58;"And then he traded a bunch of beer for our shrooms."
13:58;14:00;"Yeah, but I think the two of us, we don't go too wild."
14:00;14:03;"So I think you and I both took a very modest amount."
14:03;14:05;"Definitely wasn't hallucinating."
14:05;14:07;"Just that more of that feeling just kind of happy and chatty."
14:07;14:08;"Yeah, body high."
14:08;14:09;"Body high."
14:09;14:10;"But it was--"
14:10;14:11;"Kind of peaked while we were standing in line."
14:11;14:13;"Classic."
14:13;14:15;"It kind of peaked at some point."
14:15;14:18;"It was a little trippy because we were running into people we vaguely knew."
14:18;14:20;"Met some people who were at the Ohi shows."
14:20;14:21;"That was tight."
14:21;14:26;"But then, yeah, there was this moment we were standing on line just kind of like laughing and bull[bleep]"
14:26;14:28;"and a woman came over."
14:28;14:33;"I wouldn't say aggressively, but very confidently kept saying to me,"
14:33;14:35;"""You look like Ezra from Vampire Weekend."""
14:35;14:37;"And I said, ""I am. That's me."""
14:37;14:39;"And she said, ""No, you're not."""
14:39;14:40;"And I said, ""I am."""
14:40;14:43;"And then she showed me a picture, which admittedly I did have a different haircut,"
14:43;14:44;"looked kind of different."
14:44;14:45;"She was like, ""You're not this guy."""
14:45;14:47;"And it was a photo from like 10 years ago?"
14:47;14:49;"No, it was from like three or four years ago."
14:49;14:50;"Oh, wow."
14:50;14:54;"But especially now that my hair is kind of down and shaggy,"
14:54;14:57;"this is a little more like really clean cut looking."
14:57;15:01;"Yeah, clearly we weren't that high because when she said, ""This isn't you,"""
15:01;15:03;"I just said, ""Yeah, no, that is me."""
15:03;15:07;"Whereas if I'd been two in my head, I would have been like, ""Wait, is it?"""
15:07;15:10;"Or I might have been like, ""You're right. That's not me."""
15:10;15:13;"In every moment of life, we're different people."
15:13;15:15;"So she had this weird attitude."
15:15;15:17;"Your cells regenerate every seven years."
15:17;15:19;"Every seven years. You're right. That's not me."
15:19;15:21;"I could never tell what her vibe was."
15:21;15:26;"If she didn't believe you or knew it was you from the get-go."
15:26;15:27;"It was knowingly."
15:27;15:29;"It was just kind of like being playful."
15:29;15:34;"At that point, I was like peak shrooms, and I was just like real quiet"
15:34;15:38;"and just like kind of nervous."
15:38;15:39;"Yeah, it's funny."
15:39;15:44;"We took such like a baby amount of shrooms that we kind of just like got peaks online."
15:44;15:45;"Yeah."
15:45;15:48;"Then we go into the show, we're just kind of walking around"
15:48;15:51;"a whole crazy nightmare trying to--well, not nightmare,"
15:51;15:54;"but just like goofy situation trying to get to our seats"
15:54;15:57;"because you needed a special wristband to get to the section that we were in."
15:57;15:58;"Which we didn't know about."
15:58;16:01;"It took us 25 minutes to figure out that we needed a wristband."
16:01;16:03;"Then once we got out there, it was cool."
16:03;16:05;"Immediately spotted Bill Walton."
16:05;16:06;"Yep."
16:06;16:07;"Love and life."
16:07;16:08;"Kind of standing on the infield."
16:08;16:09;"Yep."
16:09;16:12;"Kind of getting a sense of what it might be to be like a shortstop in the major leagues."
16:12;16:14;"Oh, yeah. That was funny too."
16:14;16:18;"Yeah, we were just kind of like being on the field makes you think about baseball."
16:18;16:23;"Then once we finally were settled, they did a pretty damn good version of Deal."
16:23;16:25;"Close set one with Deal."
16:25;16:26;"That was strong."
16:26;16:29;"I think at that point, Mayor really got to start his stuff."

17:45;17:47;"So, okay, full circle back to Mayor."
17:47;17:50;"His playing was totally on point, I thought."
17:50;17:53;"Last year, his guitar playing was very Stevie Ray Vaughan, very Eric Clapton,"
17:53;17:57;"very, like, stock blues guitar playing."
17:57;17:58;"And I don't know what happened."
17:58;18:02;"If he was looking at the comments on Twitter or, like, on, like, the dead YouTube channels"
18:02;18:06;"and, like, was taking the criticism to heart, or if Bob sat him down, was like,"
18:06;18:09;"""You know what, dude? I respect you as a musician."
18:09;18:12;"The people there to hear Jerry Garcia's songs,"
18:12;18:15;"I want you to channel his language more on the guitar."""
18:15;18:17;"That's what John was doing."
18:17;18:21;"He was bringing an A game with his Jerry moves on the guitar."
18:21;18:23;"Now, the vocals, that's another matter."
18:23;18:26;"Right, but you said the guitar, he got the tone dialed in."
18:26;18:28;"Tone dialed, lyricism."
18:28;18:29;"The lyricism--"
18:29;18:30;"Dialed."
18:30;18:31;"--through the roof."
18:31;18:32;"And it's interesting."
18:32;18:37;"It's very small things that separate Jerry from, as you might say, like some guitar center."
18:37;18:38;"Yeah."
18:38;18:41;"But, yeah, he was doing the--whatever you'd call them, Jerry-isms."
18:41;18:42;"Yeah."
18:42;18:46;"And then, you know, also to his credit, it's not like he sings a ton of the songs."
18:46;18:48;"They split up vocal duties."
18:48;18:49;"Right, Bob sings most of them."
18:49;18:54;"Notably, Mayor sang ""Althea,"" which goes down fairly easy."
18:54;18:56;"""I've told Althea."""
18:56;18:58;"It's still a little funny."
18:58;19:01;"But he didn't sing ""Scarlet Begonias"" or ""Fire on the Mountain,"""
19:01;19:03;"which probably would have sounded hilarious."
19:03;19:05;"Bass player sang ""Fire."""
19:05;19:06;"Yeah."
19:06;19:08;"We wondered if they were going to play ""Fire on the Mountain"" because they're--"
19:08;19:11;"I mean, unfortunately, it's almost--it seems like a constant occurrence."
19:11;19:13;"There were some fires in the heat."
19:13;19:16;"A little fire in Burbank, some things going down in Santa Barbara."
19:16;19:18;"Isn't it bad taste to play ""Fire on the Mountain""?"
19:18;19:19;"Well, they did it."
19:19;19:20;"It went down pretty good."
19:20;19:22;"It's a naturally occurring phenomena."
19:22;19:23;"Happens every year."
19:23;19:25;"""Fire on the Mountain"" is evergreen."
19:25;19:29;"Yeah, and then, you know, when the sun went down, set 2, very strong."
19:29;19:30;"Oh, yeah, all hits."
19:30;19:31;"The set list was so good."
19:31;19:34;"Yeah, ""Sugar Magnolia,"" ""Scarfire."""
19:34;19:35;"They did ""Celebrate."""
19:35;19:38;"I love that song coming out of drums."
19:38;19:39;"There was another one."
19:39;19:41;"There was another classic, and they were forgetting."
19:41;19:43;"And then we took a super long walk."
19:43;19:46;"Also, it was so hot that actually this entire time,"
19:46;19:48;"literally I think when I saw you in the bar,"
19:48;19:50;"even before we rolled over to Dodger Stadium, I said,"
19:50;19:52;"""I'm thinking second set, we get some ice cream."""
19:52;19:55;"Yeah, you had your heart set on ice cream all night."
19:55;20:00;"I feel like we talked about on the show how gnarly the nachos were"
20:00;20:02;"at Staples Center when we saw Roger Waters."
20:02;20:03;"Right."
20:03;20:05;"Because they were just, like, so boring."
20:05;20:06;"Yeah."
20:06;20:09;"I was thinking about it because at Dodger Stadium,"
20:09;20:11;"you have fairly limited options, too."
20:11;20:14;"But they do have ice cream, and you can get it in a little Dodgers baseball helmet."
20:14;20:16;"And I was looking at everybody eating the ice cream,"
20:16;20:19;"thinking about if I was going to eat it later, and it's Fro-Yo,"
20:19;20:24;"and your only choices are chocolate, vanilla, or both, no toppings."
20:24;20:26;"No sauce, no sprinkles."
20:26;20:28;"No sauce, no sprinkles, no nuts, no nothing."
20:28;20:31;"And I'm not saying that it has to be, like, you know,"
20:31;20:35;"a bougie Fro-Yo place that has honeycomb and carob chips,"
20:35;20:36;"although that would be nice."
20:36;20:39;"But I didn't expect that, but it's, like, something."
20:39;20:44;"Well, the dumb part is people would pay a premium for, like, a yuppie sundae"
20:44;20:45;"at Dodger Stadium."
20:45;20:47;"I think it's just like the hippie in the parking lot,"
20:47;20:49;"like corporate food."
20:49;20:50;"Efficiency."
20:51;20:53;"I'm sure at Stables Center they were like, ""You know what, man?"
20:53;20:58;"The logistics of getting in those extra ingredients for the nachos are brutal."
20:58;21:01;"I'm pretty sure we can just sell people fake cheese on chips."""
21:01;21:03;"And I think it's the same thing."
21:03;21:06;"It's like whatever giant company does, like, the Dodger Stadium--"
21:06;21:07;"Concessions."
21:07;21:11;"--concessions was probably like, what do you think, four out of five people"
21:11;21:14;"probably would want a little something on top of their Fro-Yo?"
21:14;21:16;"Absolutely, and would pay extra for it."
21:16;21:19;"Dodger Stadium needs to fire their concessions because our ballparks,"
21:19;21:22;"like Safeco Field in Seattle, you can get sushi."
21:22;21:23;"Okay?"
21:23;21:24;"Seattle's like, look, we're Seattle."
21:24;21:26;"It's a great food town."
21:26;21:28;"We're going to have good food in our park."
21:28;21:30;"You could do that at Dodger Stadium so easily."
21:30;21:33;"Well, they definitely have sushi in the VIP sections."
21:33;21:36;"You know that the fat cats are eating sushi."
21:36;21:39;"I wouldn't know about that."
21:39;21:42;"I'm out there with the plebeians and the bleachers."
21:42;21:46;"Well, so anyway, after the show, you and I walked a solid three miles,"
21:46;21:48;"I think, out of Dodger Stadium."
21:48;21:49;"Deep into Silver Lake."
21:49;21:52;"But then we did make it all the way to an ice cream place."
21:52;21:56;"A small independent ice cream place called Icy Rush on Sunset."
21:56;21:57;"Oh, nice."
21:57;21:58;"Shout out to them."
21:58;21:59;"Retain the name."
21:59;22:03;"And that was definitely some of the best ice cream I ever had in my life."
22:03;22:04;"It was great."
22:04;22:05;"I felt like a little kid."
22:05;22:07;"I'd been waiting 10 hours to have ice cream."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Don't get me wrong."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"I love it."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"You look so good."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"I want you to take the dress off."
01:21:35;01:21:38;"Oh, you don't like it?"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Yeah, that's that classic misunderstanding."
01:21:40;01:21:41;"Take that off."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"You invite--"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"[laughter]"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"That's that classic misunderstanding."
01:21:45;01:21:50;"You invite somebody over to your house, fooling around,"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"start taking each other's clothes off."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"And often somebody will stop and say, ""Do you not like my clothes?"""
01:21:55;01:21:57;"This song doesn't make a lot of sense."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"I've heard a lot better from these guys."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Yeah."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"Is Florida Georgia Line--"
01:22:01;01:22:05;"There's a female lead singer and then also a male--"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"No, I think it's two guys."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"It's bro country."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Okay."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"What am I thinking of?"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Thinking of their other song."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Oh, yeah, they have the song ""BB Rexha."""
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Hold up, girl."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"That was on Time Crisis for like 15 or 20 episodes."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"Hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"It's easy to see."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"[laughter]"
01:22:25;01:22:31;"You guys just sounded like that SNL where they used to, like,"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"make up a song as they were going along."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Oh, yeah, Fred Armisen."
01:22:35;01:22:37;"I just feel like a lot of the best Florida Georgia Line singles,"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"they're, like, hyper-focused."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"Maybe I'm not giving enough--"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"Can we see what the bridge does?"

01:24:35;01:24:36;"Big Z 103, man."
01:24:36;01:24:39;"I-- Yeah, immediately I remember the end of the chorus."
01:24:39;01:24:44;"Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Wait, I'm not remembering what--"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"Such a pretty face."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"This almost seems like the subject matter could be a Florida Georgia Line song."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Yeah."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"It's about a very attractive poor girl."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Right."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Let's get into it."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"[vocalizing]"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"You remember how Mom hates--"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"--the Four Seasons?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"She hates Frankie Valli?"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Yeah."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"She hates Frankie Valli."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"And I think we were--"
01:25:17;01:25:23;"I don't know whether we were instructed to compare the kind of shrill character of Frankie Valli's falsetto"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"to the warm, creamy tone of Brian Wilson's."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"But there was definitely like an East Coast, West Coast thing in my mind."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Oh, wow."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"[vocalizing]"
01:25:35;01:25:53;"It's like a Dolly Parton song or something."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"That's what I was just thinking."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:55;01:25:56;"[vocalizing]"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Go to many colors."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"[vocalizing]"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"This part's so dope."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"[vocalizing]"
01:26:08;01:26:11;"Yeah, you're right."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"It is a sympathetic portrait."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"It's the mean kids at school called her rag doll."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"Yeah."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"And he's saying, you know what?"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"You're beautiful."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"You should be dressed in finery."
01:26:21;01:26:24;"[vocalizing]"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"Do you think that was a phrase like glad rags?"
01:26:31;01:26:32;"Oh, yeah, definitely."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Like handbags and the glad rags."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Yeah, there's that Faces song, yeah."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"[vocalizing]"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Rag doll!"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"[vocalizing]"
01:26:46;01:26:50;"So there's like a Broadway musical about the Four Seasons."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Yeah, very successful."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"You didn't see that movie directed by Clint Eastwood?"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"No, I didn't."
01:26:54;01:26:55;"What's it called?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Jersey Boys."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Oh, Jersey Boys."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Oh, and that's what the musical's called."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"You know what blew my mind about that movie,"
01:27:01;01:27:05;"because I didn't see the musical, was their manager,"

01:38:03;01:38:04;"Trump?"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"[LAUGHS]"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"No, you haven't."
01:38:07;01:38:10;"Yeah, at a Dirty Projectors show in 2005."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"2005 in Brooklyn."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Yep."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Ivanka was a big fan."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"Ivanka was there, but not DJT."
01:38:16;01:38:19;"I've just been in the same room as every music knucklehead"
01:38:19;01:38:23;"just from parties and Grammys and dumb shit like that."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"It doesn't take much."
01:38:24;01:38:27;"Have you been in the same room as Jon Bon Jovi?"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"Yes."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Joe Elliott?"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Oh, from Def Leppard?"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"Yeah."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"Probably not."
01:38:33;01:38:34;"Maybe."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Chris Cornell?"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Rest in peace."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"I think so."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"None of these are outlandish."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Wow."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"But the same room, the room could be giant."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"I want to stop it."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"It could just be the whatever, the Staples Center."
01:38:45;01:38:48;"No, if we actually talked about people that I've had a"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"meaningful interaction with--"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"No, no, no."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"I'm talking--"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"--that's totally the same room."
01:38:53;01:38:57;"Just think about festivals, gigantic events that"
01:38:57;01:38:58;"take place in arenas."
01:38:58;01:38:59;"No, I get it."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"It's a lot of, you know--"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Everybody."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Is an arena a room?"
01:39:04;01:39:05;"No, no, no."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Now we're just talking--"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"No, no, not saying you're in the same audience"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"as like--"
01:39:09;01:39:10;"Oh, OK."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Like when we went to like Roger Waters, we were sitting"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"behind Marilyn Manson."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"I don't count that as same room."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"I'm talking about like--"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"OK."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"--you're in like--"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"I think that counts as same room."
01:39:20;01:39:23;"Technically, yes, but not in the sense that I'm using it."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"You're talking about something in between literally being"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"in the same building, but not necessarily having a"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"meaningful interaction with."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"Right."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Maybe it's a dumb distinction I'm drawing."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"No, that's fair."
01:39:33;01:39:37;"Like if we had gone backstage to hang out with Roger Waters--"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Yeah."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"--and then Marilyn Manson was there, that would be what"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"I'm talking about."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"Maybe like brief fleeting eye contact with Marilyn Manson."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"OK, no, that's fair."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"That's a totally different group."
01:39:46;01:39:49;"I guess I just mean like, yeah, like these people, you just"
01:39:49;01:39:53;"kind of have this feeling like, yeah, you probably brush past"
01:39:53;01:39:56;"them-- well, maybe part of it is also just jadedness of like"
01:39:56;01:39:57;"being young."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"If you were sitting behind Marilyn Manson or something,"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"you just--"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Whoa."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"--that would be a story you might tell for years and years."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"Just be like, we went to see Roger Waters, and we were"
01:40:06;01:40:09;"sitting behind Marilyn Manson."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Like, are you a fan of Marilyn Manson?"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"No."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"But we were sitting behind him."
01:40:13;01:40:14;"It was [BLEEP] crazy."
01:40:14;01:40:17;"So in some ways, I just feel like once you go to these like"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"big goofy events, you have this feeling of like, oh, yeah,"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"you know, you've seen everybody."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"Weren't you behind Ed Sheeran at the Grammys?"
01:40:24;01:40:25;"Yes."
01:40:25;01:40:26;"Does that count?"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"That was in the whole bedsheets era."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Yeah, I tapped him on the shoulder and went, yes?"
01:40:30;01:40:31;"And I said, bedsheets."
01:40:31;01:40:34;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:40:34;01:40:39;"The number one song in 1964, you were talking about the"
01:40:39;01:40:43;"East Coast versus West Coast rivalry of the shrill tri-state"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"voices of the Four Seasons versus the smooth buttery tones"
01:40:45;01:40:49;"of these guys, the Beach Boys, ""I Get Around."""
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Round, round, get around."
01:40:51;01:40:52;"I get around."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"Yeah."
01:40:53;01:40:54;"Get around, round, round."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"Much creamier."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"I get around."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Get around, round, round."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"I get around."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"I get around, round, round."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"I get around."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Yeah, it sounds like so much more chill"
01:41:03;01:41:08;"and it's also not preoccupied with class in the way that the"
01:41:08;01:41:09;"East Coast was."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"They don't sing quite as high as Frankie Valli."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"He sings like psychotically high."
01:41:13;01:41:14;"That's true."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"I always like that little instrumental break."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"Yeah, back."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"The production is crazy on this."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"What are all those sounds?"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"I get around."
01:41:31;01:41:33;"I get around, round, round."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"I get around."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"What did he say?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"I'm a real cool what?"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Head."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Head?"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Yeah, I'm a real cool head."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"I'm making real good bread."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"Really?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Yeah."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"I don't have any context for it, but 1964, I would imagine that"
01:41:46;01:41:50;"describing yourself as a head and getting bread was like"
01:41:50;01:41:54;"something that like bebop musicians would say, not the Beach Boys."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"We're all too young to have any context for this."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"No, yeah, I don't know."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Was it like a car or surfer?"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Sure, yeah."
01:42:01;01:42:05;"Our grandparents were like, ""What on earth does that mean?"""
01:42:05;01:42:07;"I'm a real cool head."
01:42:07;01:42:09;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:42:09;01:42:13;"Or maybe this was like the awkward moment that--I'm kind of making an"
01:42:13;01:42:17;"assumption, I always assume that like head and bread was kind of like jazz"
01:42:17;01:42:21;"musician talk, which I assume coming from black, not white people, is this"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"like the awkward moment where like somebody in the studio is like, ""Hey,"
01:42:25;01:42:29;"guys, if you want your music to sound really hip, you got to throw in some"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"of that slang."""
01:42:31;01:42:33;"And Brian Wilson's like, ""Like what?"""
01:42:33;01:42:38;"""Well, you could refer to a person as a head, and you could call money bread."""
01:42:38;01:42:40;"""Bread? That's crazy."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"I make sandwiches on bread."""
01:42:42;01:42:43;"""Well, Brian, trust me."""
01:42:43;01:42:45;"Can you picture that whole thing?"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"And that's why it just sounds so like slightly awkward."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"I think it's car stuff."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"Now I want to check this."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"I'm a real cool head."
01:43:05;01:43:07;"Seinfeld, you get a number crunch on this."
01:43:07;01:43:13;"Etymology of bread meaning money."
01:43:13;01:43:18;"Obviously bread has always been a symbol of like living."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"You're the bread winner."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"You're providing."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"People need food and money."
01:43:22;01:43:27;"Yeah, according to Urban Dictionary, anyone called a cool head was an intense"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"party person, Southern California slang."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Oh."
01:43:31;01:43:36;"They might have been only into one substance, pot, or the entire pharmacy."
01:43:36;01:43:40;"Go figure on the name head shops on the West Coast, what people would call a"
01:43:40;01:43:41;"smoke shop today."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Quote, ""He's a cool head, man."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"He ain't no narc."""
01:43:46;01:43:49;"So it's like Jack Kerouac kind of stuff?"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"I guess."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"I'm a real cool head."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"I'm making real good bread."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"All right, if you say so."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"You can tell by the way he sings it."
01:43:58;01:44:01;"Wait, so I Get Around is about the fact that he has a car?"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"What's the part that he said before about--"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Keep going with the song."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"I think on one level it's like, yeah, he's got his own car."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"He and his boys are cruising on a Saturday night."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"I never understood that lyric."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"Who sang that verse?"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"Was that Mike Love?"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Yeah."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"Now all the guys go steady."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"No, it's all the guys go steady."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"I thought he was saying none of the guys go steady, but I was like, well--"
01:44:40;01:44:41;"No, no, no."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"It tracks."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"It's okay."
01:44:43;01:44:46;"All the guys go steady because it wouldn't be right"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"to leave your best girl home on a Saturday night."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"On Genius it's none."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Oh, really?"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"They have an annotation too."
01:44:53;01:44:58;"The reason none of them go steady is because they go out on Saturday nights and pick up girls."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"So I was right."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"I bet that's wrong."
01:45:01;01:45:02;"Let's listen."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"What does it sound like?"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"Everyone chill out."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Oh, yeah, it's none."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"Oh, that's hilarious."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Very confusing."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"The Beach Boys, as we talked about last--"
01:45:19;01:45:22;"What Beach Boys song were we listening to on the last episode?"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"Oh, California Girls."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"The Beach Boys have a really--"
01:45:25;01:45:28;"Will East Coast."
01:45:31;01:45:36;"I'm writing an essay on the sexual politics of the Beach Boys."
01:45:36;01:45:40;"Okay, none of the guys go steady because it wouldn't be right to leave your--"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Obviously, the--"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"I'm so confused."
01:45:42;01:45:47;"Because it begs the question, why don't you just go steady with your best girl, you dummy?"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Right?"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"So they're saying that they're going to take their best--"
01:45:51;01:45:55;"So they have multiple girlfriends, all of them, which I'm not buying for a second."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"They're saying they're going to take their best girl out on a Saturday night."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"There are no girlfriends."
01:45:59;01:46:03;"So in a sense, they are going steady because it's like--"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"No, no, no."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"So you're taking your best girl out on a Saturday night."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"I mean, look, the logic--"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Oh, no, none of them have any girlfriends."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"No."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"No."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"I think that's it."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"They're all single."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"No, no."
01:46:16;01:46:22;"What they're saying here is that each of the Beach Boys has a rotating cast of women."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Yeah."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"A harem-esque thing where he's in control."
01:46:26;01:46:33;"These hedonistic 17-year-olds in Torrance, California in 1964."
01:46:33;01:46:36;"So Brian says like, ""Hey, Mike, how come none of us go steady?"""
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Well, think-- It doesn't actually make that much sense."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"It doesn't make any sense."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"But he's kind of saying, ""Well, think about it, Brian."
01:46:41;01:46:46;"If you went steady with any one of your girls and then suddenly you met a girl who could have been the best one,"
01:46:46;01:46:49;"you wouldn't be able to take her out on Saturday night because you settled."
01:46:49;01:46:53;"You settled for a girl you really like and who treated you with dignity and respect,"
01:46:53;01:46:56;"and now you have to go out with her on Saturday night."""
01:46:56;01:46:59;"So Mike's saying like, ""Just keep your options open."""
01:46:59;01:47:02;"I guess Mike's point is that--"
01:47:02;01:47:07;"Yeah, no, because theoretically if each Beach Boy has 10 girls and each one--"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Each Beach Boy has 10 girls?"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"Each boy-- Wait, that wasn't-- Was that Jan and Dina?"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Each boy was two girls for every boy?"
01:47:14;01:47:17;"Two girls for every--"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"God, these surf songs are all insane."
01:47:20;01:47:23;"This is like borderline Gary Puckett level."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"[laughter]"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"That's funny. Gary Puckett has come up on the show."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"Oh, my God."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"Gary Puckett, OG, time crisis."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"It's a very fascinating line."
01:47:33;01:47:38;"So this is two episodes in a row we're analyzing idiotic Beach Boys lyrics"
01:47:38;01:47:43;"written by 17-year-olds 54 years ago."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"[laughter]"
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Oh, my God."
01:47:46;01:47:49;"17-year-old horn dogs."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"We're doing the heavy lifting here on time crisis."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"[laughter]"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"Yeah, these Beach Boys songs are just so bizarre."
01:47:57;01:48:00;"They're really good and they're really bad all at once."
01:48:00;01:48:01;"So here we are."
01:48:01;01:48:05;"The number one song, the Beach Boys of our time, is Drake."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"There's Drake."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Hey-oh!"
01:48:07;01:48:11;"Drake, who has seven songs on Billboard, only one song in the top five on iTunes."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"He's still-- but it happens to be number one."
01:48:13;01:48:14;"This song is called ""In My Feelings."""
01:48:14;01:48:16;"I haven't really listened to the Drake album yet."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"""In My Feelings""?"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"Yeah."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"Apparently this song is already spawning memes and stuff."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"Seinfeld, you're involved with meme culture, things of that nature."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"I read that this song was a meme."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"What does that mean?"
01:48:27;01:48:30;"There's a line that says, ""Kiki, do you love me?"""
01:48:30;01:48:33;"And there's a dance that's associated with it, so it's become one of those, like--"
01:48:33;01:48:34;"""Kiki, do you love me?"""
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Yeah."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"Who's Kiki?"
01:48:36;01:48:40;"Apparently Kiki is a reference to Keisha Chante, who's a Canadian R&B singer."
01:48:40;01:48:45;"Does it warm the cockles of your heart to hear about a Canadian romance?"
01:48:45;01:48:50;"I mean, there's a certain loyalty to it because I don't think she's very popular outside of Canada."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"But she's famous to a Canadian."
01:48:52;01:48:55;"To a certain Canadian who consumes Canadian popular culture."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"I think she'd be known."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Okay."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"As famous as the guys in ""Sloan""?"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"Oh, wow."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"Good call."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Very different audience."
01:49:03;01:49:09;"I feel like there'd be very-- the Venn diagram of those two crowds, there would be no crossover."
01:49:09;01:49:12;"Before we even listened to this song, there clearly is a parallel."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"It's like the Beach Boys wrote their weird songs."
01:49:14;01:49:19;"They were kind of establishing the rules for their moment about what it meant to be a man"
01:49:19;01:49:23;"and what your relationship was like with women and what we do for fun"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"and how we interact socially."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Culture."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"And that is what Drake does now."
01:49:28;01:49:32;"So you can totally picture in 54 years people listening to some Drake line and be like,"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"""Wait, why does that make sense?"""
01:49:34;01:49:36;"You know, and just be like, ""I don't know."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"This is some dumb shit that people used to listen to."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"This is f*cking stupid-ass pop music."""
01:49:40;01:49:44;"Some idiotic 32-year-old wrote this."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"Is he 32?"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"I don't know. I just made that up."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"He seems like he's 32."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Have you been in the same room as Drake?"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"Yes."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"Okay, cool."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Multiple times."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"Quality time with him?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"No."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Shook his hand?"
01:49:55;01:49:56;"Yes."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Nice firm handshake once."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"Did he know who you were?"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"Didn't seem like it."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Unclear."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"All right, let's listen to ""In My Feelings"" by Drake"
01:50:02;01:50:06;"and let's try to imagine that it's 54 years later."
01:50:06;01:50:10;"Okay, so it's 27-- wait, what?"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"2072."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"Okay, 2070."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"Is it possible we'll be alive in 54 years?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"I'd be 88. That's possible."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"That's pushing it for me."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"You'd be, what, 95?"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"Yeah."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"With new technology, it's totally possible."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Time crisis episode."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Yo!"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"3000."
01:50:28;01:50:32;"How crazy would that be if we're still doing time crisis"
01:50:32;01:50:37;"and in 54 years later, just like a real TC head,"
01:50:37;01:50:41;"maybe like a 37-year-old who listens to it ironically,"
01:50:41;01:50:45;"a 37-year-old who's, like, very interested in Trump-era culture"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"doing their dissertation, like, sends an email to Seinfeld"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"being like, ""Hey, guys, I'm doing a dissertation"
01:50:52;01:50:55;"on Trump-era culture."""
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Specifically Trump-era EDM."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"But Apple could totally just feed all these shows"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"into some sort of AI thing and--"
01:51:03;01:51:04;"And they just keep doing it."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"I think so, yeah."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"And I just wanted to point out to you guys"
01:51:07;01:51:11;"that you're coming up on the 54-year anniversary"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"of episode 72, and I'm just curious to see"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"if you guys plan on revisiting ""In My Feelings"" by Drake."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"And Jake will be like, ""Nah!"""
01:51:20;01:51:23;"[laughter]"
01:51:23;01:51:30;"""We got an interesting pull from the mailbag today."""
01:51:30;01:51:31;"Oh, my God."
01:51:31;01:51:34;"We just have no memory of this whatsoever."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"So slow, every word."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"Okay, we got to listen to ""In My Feelings"" by Drake."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"This is interesting."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"I think most of our-- probably half our listeners"

01:54:00;01:54:02;"None of the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"to leave your best girl hanging on a Saturday night."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Proto-Drake, dude."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Or the original Drake."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Oh, that was a journey."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"That was quite a journey through 1964 and today."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"In some ways, not a lot's changed."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"Some of the same values."
01:54:16;01:54:20;"Hedonistic, self-obsessed values, man."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"Narcissistic culture of the West."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"Everybody's just trying to figure it out, I guess."
01:54:25;01:54:28;"But that was an illusion."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"But this was an illusion."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Yeah."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Can we give a birthday shout-out to someone"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"who emailed us during this show?"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Sure."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"Colin Ford, turning 25 today."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Loves Vampire Weekend."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"He saw them at--"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"you guys at Pitchfork."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Nice."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"2011."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Okay."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"25 today."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"Sick."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"That kind of sounds like a Canadian name."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"Is it?"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"I don't think so."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"But there's some truth to that."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"I don't know why."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Why is that?"
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Colin?"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Is it Colin or-- not the Ford."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"Ford's very American."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"Well, Rob Ford."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"The mayor of Toronto used to be, yeah."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Of course."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"The premier of Ontario is his brother."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"Anyway."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"No, Colin Ford could totally be an American name, too."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"But just because when you say it, it sounds Canadian."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Cool."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Cool and-- what do I say?"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Anyway, happy 25th birthday to Colin Ford."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"Thanks for checking out Vampire Weekend at Pitchfork."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Come check us out in the future."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"Got some festivals this summer."
01:55:21;01:55:24;"But the real touring is yet to come."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Well, thanks for joining us, Dave."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"Thanks for having me."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"Congrats on the record."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"Congrats on the album, man."
01:55:29;01:55:30;"Thank you, sirs."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"Shout out to Merc, a.k.a."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Oreo, a.k.a."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Gregorio."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Check out more of Merc's music."
01:55:36;01:55:39;"Merc361, check him out on SoundCloud."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"And thanks so much to Winter for coming in."
01:55:41;01:55:45;"This is a real loaded episode in more ways than one."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"This is a flavor-blasted episode."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"All right."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"Take care of each other."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Be safe."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"We'll see you soon."
