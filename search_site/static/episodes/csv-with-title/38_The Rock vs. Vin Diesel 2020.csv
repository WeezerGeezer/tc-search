00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, Sunday, March 12th."
00:04;00:07;"There's a lot to discuss."
00:07;00:11;"Jake made a Home Depot playlist, a dream playlist."
00:11;00:16;"Vin Diesel sang a Kygo and Selena Gomez song."
00:16;00:23;"All this, plus Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Dave Longstreth as our guest,"
00:23;00:28;"and the top five hits of 2017 and 1981."
00:28;00:37;"This is... Time Crisis, with Ezra Keenan. B-b-b-b-b-beastz. 1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I delved to the floor, when a bus had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:26;"Leave her lonely there, staring at the ceiling."
01:26;01:32;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:32;01:41;"2."
01:41;01:48;"How do you feel? Is it loneliness?"
01:48;01:55;"Is there shining in your heart, but no gloss on your lips?"
01:55;02:06;"Do you sail alone, round the island with a silhouette of a shark beneath the skin?"
02:06;02:08;"And then you say..."
02:08;02:12;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
02:12;02:15;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
02:15;02:19;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
02:19;02:21;"The right one, the right one."
02:21;02:27;"3."
02:27;02:36;"You've been waiting for your love in me."
02:36;02:40;"And there's been waters and deep."
02:40;02:48;"We've been hanging tight for all the things we would have loved."
02:48;02:54;"So wait, but if only I was there."
02:54;02:57;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
02:57;03:00;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
03:00;03:04;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
03:04;03:07;"The right one, the right one."
03:07;03:10;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
03:13;03:17;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one."
03:17;03:19;"The right one, the right one."
03:19;03:26;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
03:26;03:28;"Time Crisis, Sunday, March 12th."
03:28;03:30;"We're back."
03:30;03:31;"I'm here with Jake."
03:31;03:31;"What's up, Jake?"
03:31;03:33;"Hey."
03:33;03:34;"But this time we got a bonus."
03:34;03:36;"We got a bonus Longstreth in the building."
03:36;03:37;"Dave Longstreth."
03:37;03:38;"What's up, Dave?"
03:38;03:39;"What's up?"
03:39;03:41;"So Dave, you've been on the show before."
03:41;03:42;"Yeah."
03:42;03:46;"Dave is the guy behind the group Dirty Projectors."
03:46;03:47;"Known him for a long time."
03:47;03:48;"He's also Jake's brother."
03:48;03:53;"Just dropped a new album, but we've known each other too long"
03:53;03:55;"for me to ask you questions about your new album."
03:55;03:59;"So we're just gonna talk about more like Time Crisis type stuff."
03:59;04:00;"Although it is out."
04:00;04:01;"Check it out."
04:01;04:06;"You can stream it on Apple Music and you can buy it on vinyl at your local record store."
04:06;04:07;"Oh, yeah, I do."
04:07;04:09;"I do want to say, wow, the vinyl looks sick."
04:09;04:10;"Yeah."
04:10;04:11;"Oh, cool."
04:11;04:15;"'Cause you actually printed it on, it's like a gray cloudy vinyl."
04:15;04:21;"It's that stuff, duvetyne, that like weird black light absorbing fabric."
04:21;04:23;"People use it in like theater productions."
04:23;04:23;"Yeah, yeah."
04:23;04:28;"And then the things are like black plexiglass reflecting a ceiling."
04:28;04:28;"It looks really..."
04:28;04:30;"It's not printed on duvetyne."
04:30;04:31;"No, no, no."
04:31;04:31;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
04:31;04:32;"I haven't seen it."
04:32;04:34;"Domino hasn't sent me one."
04:34;04:34;"I literally have..."
04:34;04:35;"You only seen pictures?"
04:35;04:37;"I've only seen pictures."
04:37;04:37;"Damn."
04:37;04:39;"I don't have a copy of the album."
04:39;04:42;"You gotta pick one up, man."
04:42;04:43;"Swing by Amoeba."
04:43;04:45;"I know, I should."
04:45;04:45;"Gimme, gimme."
04:45;04:49;"Mom and dad asked for one too, Jake."
04:49;04:50;"Hook 'em up."
04:50;04:50;"I know, I got some."
04:50;04:52;"It's so funny when you're around siblings,"
04:52;04:56;"'cause your siblings are the only people you can talk about your parents as mom and dad."
04:56;05:00;"In fact, it's really hilarious and a very weird character trait"
05:00;05:02;"when people say that to people who aren't their siblings."
05:02;05:06;"So for instance, you guys together, you would say,"
05:06;05:09;"""Oh, by the way, mom said, dad said."""
05:09;05:11;"Or M, M and D."
05:11;05:13;"Wait, you call your parents M and D?"
05:13;05:13;"Yeah."
05:13;05:14;"Frequently."
05:15;05:16;"In text or in language?"
05:16;05:17;"Like verbal language."
05:17;05:19;"Mom and dad, this seems long."
05:19;05:23;"M and D is a little bit shorter."
05:23;05:24;"Wait, so you'll just be like..."
05:24;05:29;"So M and D said they were gonna come visit in mid-April."
05:29;05:29;"Yep."
05:29;05:30;"Yeah."
05:30;05:32;"It's like not even a joke at this point."
05:32;05:36;"M said she wanted to definitely go check out the museum while she was here,"
05:36;05:39;"while D said it'd be cool maybe to go down to Marina del Rey and do some fishing."
05:39;05:42;"That's like an actual conversation?"
05:43;05:45;"M and D, it sounds like R and D."
05:45;05:56;"Huh."
08:56;08:59;"So two weeks ago we did the show and it was Oscars day."
08:59;09:04;"So when you do a show every two weeks, it's always kind of hard to know,"
09:04;09:07;"like should you cover stuff that happened in the past two weeks?"
09:07;09:09;"Like should we talk about the Oscars right now?"
09:09;09:13;"Right, because we did the Grammys recap, which was great because you were there,"
09:14;09:17;"and so there were a lot of anecdotes to relay."
09:17;09:17;"Right."
09:17;09:22;"We probably have a lot of new insightful things to say about the Grammys."
09:22;09:24;"Oh, he's still talking about the Grammys."
09:24;09:27;"That's funny, why don't we just keep talking about the Grammys after all the award shows?"
09:27;09:28;"Oscars were cool."
09:28;09:33;"Oh yeah, well one thing I can say is I've met that guy, the producer before."
09:33;09:35;"Which producer?"
09:35;09:38;"The producer who said, ""Stop, Moonlight, you won."""
09:38;09:39;"Oh, this is not a joke."
09:39;09:40;"This is not a joke."
09:40;09:42;"His wife, who he referred to-"
09:42;09:43;"Yeah, why didn't you call her?"
09:43;09:44;"As his blue-eyed wife."
09:44;09:45;"That was so strange."
09:45;09:47;"For anybody who didn't see or doesn't remember that part,"
09:47;09:51;"when the La La Land people thought they'd won and they were giving their speeches,"
09:51;09:53;"which is the most brutal part of all of it,"
09:53;09:57;"is just being like, ""Believe in your dreams,"" and then you find out it didn't happen."
09:57;10:00;"One of the producers referred to his blue-eyed wife."
10:00;10:03;"He said, ""I've got a great baby,"" and you know, ""Julia, you have a blue-eyed-"""
10:03;10:04;"My beautiful blue-eyed wife."
10:04;10:07;"Well anyway, his blue-eyed wife went to Columbia."
10:07;10:11;"She actually directed Rostam and I in a production of Romeo and Juliet."
10:12;10:13;"Whoa."
10:13;10:16;"So, we got a connection to this whole fiasco."
10:16;10:18;"Wait, you guys both acted in a production?"
10:18;10:21;"We were like the bottom of the barrel, like the dudes had a couple lines."
10:21;10:23;"We were the night watchmen."
10:23;10:24;"You both were?"
10:24;10:24;"Yeah."
10:24;10:25;"Together?"
10:25;10:26;"Before Vampire."
10:26;10:29;"Yeah, this was like freshman year, night watchman number one and two."
10:29;10:29;"Maybe sophomore year."
10:29;10:36;"But anyway, the director was Julia Hart, who was the blue-eyed wife of the speech."
10:36;10:41;"And then once I'd met him, I met that guy via her."
10:41;10:46;"He was casting a movie that was like about- that involved like an indie band in Chicago."
10:46;10:49;"Like a struggling indie band in Chicago."
10:49;10:55;"And like to his credit, he was trying to cast real musicians to play the roles."
10:55;10:57;"Although this is one thing that I will say."
10:57;11:03;"I do believe in myself and I believe I could learn a lot of things."
11:03;11:05;"But one thing that I just am not good at is acting."
11:05;11:06;"I feel the same."
11:06;11:08;"You know, we both come from music."
11:08;11:14;"There's so many things that, you know, a musician's ear could translate into."
11:14;11:18;"Or like the way you put together an album is not dissimilar from a lot of other art forms."
11:18;11:19;"But acting, acting and singing."
11:19;11:20;"I've always had this theory, actually."
11:20;11:23;"Rappers are good actors."
11:23;11:25;"Singers are terrible actors."
11:25;11:29;"And people are going to think, am I trying to make like a racial point?"
11:29;11:30;"No."
11:30;11:33;"You're not?"
11:33;11:34;"Obviously not."
11:34;11:36;"Because this crosses racial lines."
11:37;11:39;"Eminem, white rapper."
11:39;11:40;"Great actor."
11:40;11:41;"Crushed it."
11:41;11:41;"8 mile."
11:41;11:46;"Mariah Carey, biracial singer."
11:46;11:51;"This is not my opinion, but generally she was regarded as a poor actress."
11:51;11:53;"Although she wasn't, she was good and precious."
11:53;11:54;"But what's your theory?"
11:54;11:54;"Why?"
11:54;11:55;"Here's why I would guess."
11:55;11:56;"I've thought about it before."
11:56;12:00;"I think if you're good at rapping, you're good at expressing yourself that way."
12:00;12:04;"You'll probably be good at conveying reality via the dramatic arts."
12:04;12:10;"Whereas if you sing and you get the things that are valued in a sink and being a good"
12:10;12:12;"singer to me are like antithetical to being a good actor."
12:12;12:15;"Now I'm thinking of great singers that were great actors."
12:15;12:16;"Like who?"
12:16;12:17;"Chris Christopherson."
12:17;12:17;"Debatable."
12:17;12:20;"He was the lead in Heaven's Gate."
12:20;12:22;"Incredible film."
12:22;12:23;"Bombed, but incredible film."
12:23;12:25;"And then Frank Sinatra."
12:25;12:26;"Okay."
12:26;12:27;"Manchurian candidate."
12:27;12:29;"Frank Sinatra is like a weird one because he's like."
12:29;12:30;"He's kind of like a rapper, right?"
12:30;12:32;"His vibe."
12:32;12:33;"In a way."
12:33;12:34;"I'm just trying to think like."
12:34;12:40;"This is again, not my opinion."
12:40;12:42;"Because as you know, I'm a huge Beyonce fan."
12:42;12:44;"She was robbed at the Grammys."
12:44;12:48;"However, for someone who's considered one of the most talented people on planet Earth"
12:48;12:55;"right now, even many of her biggest supporters don't consider her to be a great actress."
12:55;12:56;"Yeah."
12:56;12:57;"She's a good actress."
12:57;12:58;"She's not great."
12:58;13:01;"Whereas like Ice Cube is a great actor."
13:01;13:02;"Yeah, he does it."
13:02;13:05;"Eminem was a great actor in the one movie he ever was in."
13:05;13:07;"And there was one role that he was born to play."
13:07;13:09;"Rabbit."
13:09;13:11;"Himself."
13:11;13:12;"Himself, the character."
13:12;13:36;"I don't know."
13:36;13:37;"Maybe this is a half-baked theory."
13:37;13:40;"I've just always thought that the rap community has produced."
13:40;13:43;"Some very, very high caliber actors."
13:43;13:47;"Yeah, and the singing community has been and singers always want to try acting."
13:47;13:49;"It's classic and they almost always fail."
13:49;13:51;"Yeah, and it goes to Madonna."
13:51;13:52;"That's a classic one."
13:52;13:52;"Oh, yeah."
13:52;13:53;"She's always."
13:53;13:56;"And you know, I think she gets a better body of evidence, dude."
13:56;13:59;"People are always really hard on Madonna as an actress."
13:59;14:00;"Maybe she's not terrible."
14:00;14:02;"She's just sort of maybe people."
14:02;14:03;"I don't know."
14:03;14:04;"People like to tear it out."
14:04;14:04;"Yeah."
14:04;14:07;"The 1987 Bruce Willis album."
14:09;14:13;"Yeah, that's a fascinating period because he is coming off of moonlighting."
14:13;14:15;"It's right before his cast and die hard."
14:15;14:18;"Cuts this like pop album."
14:18;14:19;"Very bizarre."
14:19;14:22;"It was kind of well, it was kind of bluesy."
14:22;14:25;"It was kind of like, Jake, I've heard you talk about this album."
14:25;14:28;"We pull it up, but I haven't ever heard it."
14:28;14:31;"Just like the first track of the 87 Bruce Willis album."
14:31;14:33;"Guys, I think we just figured out that this show."
14:33;14:36;"We can talk about Oscars and the Grammys by talking about."
14:36;14:37;"There you go."
14:37;14:41;"That rare breed of person who can elegantly slide between."
14:41;14:45;"I was about to say the stage, but they're both there."
14:45;14:46;"The stage is stage in the stage."
14:46;14:53;"The recording studio in the movie set can elegantly slide between the silver screen."
14:53;14:55;"And the stream."
14:55;14:57;"I'm a holes in tree."
14:57;15:01;"I'm not a music stream that period of Bruce Willis doing die hard and then making this"
15:01;15:02;"record like within the same year."
15:02;15:03;"Also, how funny is it?"
15:03;15:05;"Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Willis."
15:06;15:08;"You guys from South Jersey."
15:08;15:10;"Wait, Bruce, I didn't know that about Bruce Willis."
15:10;15:11;"Yeah, he's from South Jersey."
15:11;15:11;"Wow."
15:11;15:14;"I wonder if he's a Springsteen head."
15:14;15:15;"Seems like he would be, but."
15:15;15:19;"Wait, this is Willis?"
15:19;15:22;"Yeah, this is Bruce Willis is and I think it did OK."
15:22;15:25;"That Phil was so Max Weinberg."
15:25;15:26;"Yeah, yeah, super important."
15:26;15:29;"The USA, whose production is super like darkness on the other town."
15:29;15:32;"Well, I think it more like a tunnel of love."
15:35;15:36;"So kind of a."
15:36;15:40;"I'm a Huey Lewis, but yeah."
15:40;15:49;"See, he's like trying to be somebody else or trying to be like Kenny Rogers or something."
15:49;15:52;"Don't give a don't give a heck."
15:52;15:56;"It's kind of like Eagles."
15:56;16:10;"It is drummer's a shredder, very technical drummer."
16:10;16:19;"I feel like he makes the vocals too low."
16:19;16:28;"It's a real thin vocal."
16:28;16:28;"Yeah."
16:28;16:44;"Compellingly, though."
16:44;17:08;"It go down in the DM time crisis with Ezra Koenig on beats one."
17:08;17:10;"I wonder what the backstory in that record is."
17:10;17:14;"Maybe he was like a music, you know, this is like a guy that liked"
17:14;17:18;"to meet to do music, but was like not particularly talented."
17:18;17:19;"I don't know."
17:19;17:22;"I mean, it's just like I'm kind of famous, but it was before he was really famous."
17:22;17:23;"That's what's weird to me."
17:23;17:26;"It was before he was a big action star."
17:26;17:29;"I mean, on a TV show, it's really weird."
17:29;17:30;"You know what?"
17:30;17:35;"I think we forget most artists are multifaceted or at least they have multiple interests."
17:35;17:38;"You know, when it works, we really remember."
17:38;17:38;"Yeah."
17:38;17:43;"And we're like, wow, Kanye made his sneakers and albums and"
17:43;17:44;"fashion and all these things."
17:44;17:48;"And when it doesn't work, it becomes like a funny footnote."
17:48;17:49;"Right."
17:49;17:50;"Or, you know, I think it worked okay."
17:50;17:53;"So you're just kind of like, you know, Bruce Springsteen made an album."
17:53;17:53;"Willis."
17:53;17:55;"Oh, right."
17:55;17:56;"I mean, that's just tough."
17:56;17:58;"Like mid eighties, Jersey guy named Bruce."
17:58;18:02;"That's an uphill battle coming out."
18:02;18:06;"Well, actually, this segues very nicely into something I wanted to talk about with you guys"
18:06;18:07;"today."
18:07;18:08;"Okay."
18:08;18:12;"There's a new song by Kygo and Selena Gomez called It Ain't Me."
18:12;18:15;"I don't think it's been hanging on the top five, so we're not going to get to talk about"
18:15;18:15;"it later."
18:15;18:18;"So I'm making an executive decision to talk about it now."
18:18;18:18;"Okay."
18:18;18:19;"First question."
18:19;18:21;"Do either of you know who Kygo is?"
18:21;18:22;"No."
18:22;18:23;"Dave?"
18:23;18:26;"Vaguely."
18:26;18:26;"All right."
18:26;18:27;"What's your impression of Kygo?"
18:27;18:35;"Maybe he dates someone from a reality show."
18:35;18:35;"What?"
18:35;18:37;"Oh, you're thinking of Tyga."
18:37;18:39;"Oh, right."
18:40;18:43;"Yeah, Tyga is like a secondary character on Keeping Up With The Kardashians."
18:43;18:43;"Okay."
18:43;18:44;"He's a rapper."
18:44;18:46;"Okay."
18:46;18:46;"Kygo."
18:46;18:47;"Any more guesses?"
18:47;18:48;"KYGO."
18:48;18:52;"He comes from the land of Scandinavia."
18:52;18:53;"I'm not sure which country."
18:53;18:55;"So he's a singer."
18:55;18:56;"No."
18:56;18:57;"Okay."
18:57;18:58;"He is a musician."
18:58;18:59;"Bass player?"
18:59;19:02;"Yes."
19:02;19:02;"Percussionist."
19:02;19:06;"He's the hottest five string fretless bass player."
19:06;19:08;"The kids are going bananas for him."
19:09;19:13;"Not since Jaco has there been a basis with this kind of heat on them."
19:13;19:14;"No."
19:14;19:15;"Kygo is a DJ."
19:15;19:16;"Duh."
19:16;19:17;"Of course."
19:17;19:19;"He's associated with the genre Tropical House."
19:19;19:22;"I love that genre."
19:22;19:24;"Which is, you know, it's a little slower."
19:24;19:26;"It's about 100 BPM."
19:26;19:27;"Usually."
19:27;19:28;"Do you guys know who Selena Gomez is?"
19:28;19:30;"Vaguely."
19:30;19:32;"Oh, she's an actress, right?"
19:32;19:33;"Yeah, right."
19:33;19:34;"She's an actress singer."
19:34;19:35;"Was she in Spring Breakers?"
19:35;19:36;"Yeah, she was in Spring Breakers."
19:36;19:37;"She was the girl in the movie."
19:37;19:38;"She was the girl on the bus."
19:38;19:39;"Yeah."
19:39;19:40;"She was like, I'm out of here."
19:40;19:40;"Right."
19:40;19:43;"She made the good call."
19:43;19:43;"I don't know her music."
19:43;19:46;"I think she started out on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel."
19:46;19:49;"Then she has become a successful singer."
19:49;19:51;"Anyway, they did a song together and it's called It Ain't Me."
19:51;19:54;"What I like about the song, it's kind of Tropical House meets."
19:54;20:00;"Remember like a few years ago when there's all that like, kind of like EDM folk country stuff."
20:00;20:02;"Oh yeah."
20:02;20:02;"Like what?"
20:02;20:05;"Avicii and Alla Black."
20:05;20:05;"Yeah."
20:05;20:06;"What was that song called?"
20:06;20:07;"Timber."
20:07;20:09;"Oh no, Timber was Kesha."
20:09;20:10;"Yeah."
20:10;20:11;"There were a couple of them."
20:11;20:12;"There was a moment."
20:12;20:16;"It was kind of like this post Mumford and Sons meets dance music thing."
20:16;20:19;"And so this song, it's interesting."
20:19;20:19;"I like it."
20:19;20:19;"It has."
20:19;20:21;"So let me just play it for you guys."
20:21;20:21;"Okay."
20:21;20:22;"And the lyrics."
20:22;20:26;"Is this similarly like Capitalism at Work in terms of cross branding these two?"
20:26;20:30;"Oh, you mean like did the A&R guy be like Kygo and Selena Gomez match made in heaven."
20:30;20:32;"We're going to hit all the target demos."
20:32;20:32;"Right."
20:32;20:33;"I mean, maybe."
20:33;20:35;"It's win-win."
20:35;20:38;"It's pairing a hot DJ with like a hot pop star."
20:38;20:39;"It's a no brainer."
20:49;20:57;"I had a dream we were sipping whiskey need highest floor the bowery and I was high enough"
20:57;21:06;"somewhere along the lines we stopped seeing eye to eye you were staying out all night and I had"
21:06;21:15;"enough no I don't want to know where you've been or where you're going but I know I won't be home"
21:15;21:21;"and you'll be on your own who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning"
21:21;21:29;"who's gonna rock you in the sun room where you sleep who's waking up to drop you home"
21:29;21:33;"when you're drunk and all alone who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning"
21:33;21:34;"Like that little gospel chord."
21:34;21:36;"Yeah, I saw that."
21:36;21:38;"I heard this song on the way here."
21:38;21:38;"Oh, really?"
21:38;21:39;"Yeah, yeah."
21:39;21:42;"And then the drop that just goes on forever."
21:43;21:47;"Like in another song, it'd be like and we're back at the verse in two, four."
21:47;21:48;"Yeah."
21:48;21:48;"Nope."
21:48;21:51;"Sticking with the drop for a second."
21:51;21:57;"All right, and we're gonna bring back in Selena with verse two right about."
21:57;21:59;"Okay, now we're gonna keep going with the drop."
21:59;22:04;"America loves drops now."
22:04;22:11;"Letting it breathe."
22:11;22:16;"Letting it breathe."
22:16;22:18;"The opening lines of the song, I don't know if you caught them."
22:18;22:18;"Yeah."
22:18;22:22;"I had a dream we were sipping whiskey neat."
22:22;22:23;"Right."
22:23;22:25;"Which is not something you're in a country song, sure."
22:25;22:33;"But like I had a dream we were sipping whiskey neat highest floor the Bowery nowhere's high"
22:33;22:33;"enough."
22:33;22:35;"So I love that."
22:35;22:36;"I love that detail."
22:36;22:41;"And also for anybody doesn't know the Bowery is like a fancy hotel in downtown Manhattan."
22:41;22:44;"We should try to get Selena Gomez on the show."
22:44;22:48;"I'd love to know how she feels about the lyrics because I believe she did not write any of them."
22:48;22:52;"I do think they're good lyrics, actually, though, because it really it sets it up,"
22:52;22:53;"paints a picture."
22:53;22:57;"Yeah, I don't know if I've ever heard the phrase whiskey neat in a song."
22:57;22:59;"We were sipping whiskey neat."
22:59;23:01;"Actually, that's or maybe that's like some Sinatra."
23:01;23:06;"We were sipping whiskey neat highest floor the Bowery."
23:06;23:09;"You know, it's similar when we listen to Chainsmokers Coldplay song and the lyrics just"
23:09;23:11;"jumped out is not typical pop lyrics."
23:11;23:12;"Right."
23:12;23:12;"For better or for worse."
23:12;23:17;"But basically, she's getting the end of a relationship with some guy who sounds like"
23:17;23:17;"he's drunk."
23:17;23:19;"He's selfish."
23:19;23:21;"He just parties all the time."
23:21;23:26;"And she says, and I like the pre-chorus, who's going to take you home when you're drunk and"
23:26;23:27;"all alone?"
23:27;23:29;"Who's going to do all this stuff that I do?"
23:29;23:30;"Who's going to do it?"
23:30;23:32;"Well, not her problem."
23:32;23:32;"It ain't me."
23:32;23:35;"And then when you listen to the drop, you very clear."
23:35;23:39;"It's a funny job because you very clearly just hear the words whiskey, neat and Bowery."
23:39;23:43;"So I wonder people hear this and just like whiskey, neat and Bowery."
23:43;23:43;"It's so random."
23:43;23:59;"You guys catch that summer nights in the where Libertine, the Libertines was that the Libertines"
23:59;24:01;"are like the English strokes."
24:01;24:02;"Do you remember that?"
24:02;24:04;"No, I never heard of them."
24:04;24:04;"They've heard of them."
24:04;24:05;"Yeah."
24:05;24:07;"The singer was named Pete Doherty."
24:07;24:08;"There's some debate in the room."
24:08;24:12;"If it's Doherty or Doherty, it's hard to tell what the English English last name sounds"
24:12;24:14;"at very surprising pronunciations."
24:14;24:19;"They never were huge in America, but in England, they truly were like a big phenomenon."
24:19;24:21;"Same time as the strokes early twos."
24:21;24:24;"Yeah, right after just after."
24:24;24:25;"So they were compared to them a lot."
24:25;24:28;"But so, so the second verse is I had a dream."
24:28;24:32;"We were back at 17 summer nights."
24:32;24:35;"The Libertines never growing old."
24:35;24:37;"And, you know, I like it."
24:37;24:41;"It's like about thinking back to your youth, how you felt differently."
24:41;24:48;"Then I wonder if Selena Gomez is Libertines fan, if she related to the line or if she"
24:48;24:50;"was just like, all right, who's that?"
24:50;24:51;"I mean, she might know them."
24:51;24:54;"It's certainly not impossible, but like that's like 15 years ago, dude."
24:54;24:54;"How old is she?"
24:54;24:55;"Like 18?"
24:55;24:57;"No, she's older than that."
24:57;24:57;"22."
24:57;25:00;"My call is that she didn't know who the Libertines were."
25:00;25:01;"Well, one thing's for sure."
25:01;25:03;"She wasn't 17 when they came out, right?"
25:03;25:07;"Back in the summer of 69."
25:07;25:07;"Yeah, she's 24."
25:07;25:12;"So she, you know, we all listen to music from before we were there."
25:12;25:18;"But again, the reference of the Libertines as like, man, when we were 17, that was our."
25:18;25:22;"I imagine she probably doesn't feel that way."
25:22;25:28;"This is a stark example of a singer that's clearly not the writer of the lyrics just"
25:28;25:29;"because of the references being made."
25:30;25:33;"I mean, I'm not going to go as far as to say that."
25:33;25:34;"It's not even a problem."
25:34;25:42;"Selena Gomez is incapable of writing a song where she embodies the viewpoint of a 39 year"
25:42;25:43;"old."
25:43;25:46;"I just don't think she's credited as the lyric writer."
25:46;25:46;"We know it."
25:46;25:47;"But usually it's interesting."
25:47;25:51;"I just have never thought about that before, because usually you're like, you're pairing"
25:51;25:56;"a singer with songs that seem appropriate, whether sort of thematically for them to sing."
25:56;25:59;"And this is like a funny disconnect."
25:59;26:00;"Here's the way it makes sense."
26:00;26:04;"Maybe like she's, you know, she's dating like Colin Farrell."
26:04;26:05;"That's too funny."
26:05;26:08;"So let's say like Selena Gomez is dating Colin Farrell."
26:08;26:11;"And at first she's like, oh, he's like this suave older actor."
26:11;26:13;"And then she's and it's like really cool."
26:13;26:14;"She's staying at a fancy hotel with him."
26:14;26:18;"And then little by little, she's like, no, dude, you have a substance abuse problem."
26:18;26:23;"And if I don't break up with you, this is really unfair to all parties involved, by"
26:23;26:23;"the way."
26:23;26:26;"But she's like, I got to get away from you, man."
26:26;26:28;"I thought you were a fun, youthful actor."
26:29;26:30;"Turns out you're just a drunk man."
26:30;26:35;"And so she's like, I remember I was drinking whiskey neat with this dude."
26:35;26:37;"He was telling me about how fancy the whiskey is."
26:37;26:38;"And I just and that's when it clicked."
26:38;26:39;"And I was like, I don't care."
26:39;26:42;"I don't care, man."
26:42;26:44;"I want to date Kygo."
26:44;26:45;"And then maybe in the second verse."
26:45;26:48;"Actually, it doesn't really hold up."
26:48;26:53;"It doesn't hold up the perspective anyway, but I don't care about your 90s British alt"
26:53;26:54;"rock either, dude."
26:54;26:58;"Yeah, he was always talking about the liberties."
26:58;27:00;"Oh, would you guys like the song?"
27:00;27:01;"I like it."
27:01;27:05;"I like the folky melodies."
27:05;27:10;"I like the phrase, dark side of the morning is good."
27:10;27:10;"Oh, yeah."
27:10;27:11;"Dark side of the morning."
27:11;27:15;"Which is a subtle Floyd reference."
27:15;27:16;"I mean, I couldn't help it."
27:16;27:18;"It's so subtle."
27:18;27:19;"It has to be."
27:19;27:19;"It has to be."
27:19;27:23;"Well, I mean, I was like, oh, I thought she was going to say moon, like dark side of the"
27:23;27:24;"moon."
27:24;27:25;"Oh, morning."
27:26;27:27;"Wait, I just want to point out."
27:27;27:30;"I also really like that."
27:30;27:31;"That is I can."
27:31;27:33;"Dave, would you consider that a gospel move?"
27:33;27:34;"The major three?"
27:34;27:35;"Or like stepping the chords up?"
27:35;27:39;"That's gospel, right?"
27:39;27:42;"I've heard you play that on the piano before."
27:42;27:42;"Yeah."
27:42;27:43;"And be like the major three."
27:43;27:44;"That's that kind of gospel thing."
27:44;27:44;"I'm like a word."
27:44;27:45;"I guess it is."
27:45;27:48;"Oh, because your vibe is like, I don't know."
27:48;27:49;"I don't know."
27:49;27:52;"It's also very killers."
27:52;27:54;"That pass, like a passing chord or like a."
27:55;27:59;"To me, it sounds like a gospel passing court, but I guess maybe in this context, because"
27:59;28:01;"Brandon Flowers and the Killers uses it a lot."
28:01;28:05;"Oh, what's that killer song that uses that about being a."
28:05;28:09;"To take you home when you're broke."
28:09;28:12;"Very killers movement."
28:12;28:12;"Right."
28:12;28:14;"Right."
28:14;28:16;"This song is kind of like, are we human?"
28:16;28:23;"So anyway, it ain't me."
28:24;28:27;"An endlessly fascinating song from Kygo and Selena Gomez."
28:27;28:28;"I like it."
28:28;28:31;"The guitar in the beginning reminds me of the guitar from."
28:31;28:33;"Sorry, actually."
28:33;28:37;"Yeah, like the Bieber ballad."
28:37;28:40;"Love yourself."
28:40;28:41;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
28:41;28:42;"I had the same thought."
28:42;28:44;"Same kind of voice."
28:44;28:45;"The two notes."
28:45;28:47;"Maybe the same person."
28:47;28:49;"Well, I also just like the sentiment."
28:49;28:50;"It's a classic sentiment."
28:50;28:51;"Bob Dylan."
28:51;28:52;"It ain't me, babe."
28:52;28:53;"NWA."
28:53;28:53;"I ain't the one."
28:54;28:55;"You know what, Kygo?"
28:55;29:00;"You could probably find a girl who loves the Libertines and fancy whiskey and stand at the"
29:00;29:01;"Bowery, but it ain't me."
29:01;29:04;"I want to stay at the standard."
29:04;29:05;"I'm not knocking it."
29:05;29:07;"I want to drink gin."
29:07;29:10;"No, it's call and I want to listen to Bach party."
29:10;29:12;"It ain't me."
30:10;30:16;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat 1."
30:16;30:19;"I'm not the only Jack dude who loved that song."
30:19;30:21;"Yeah?"
30:21;30:22;"Another Jack dude."
30:22;30:24;"Great lead in."
30:24;30:27;"Sorry, what is this phrase?"
30:27;30:28;"Jack dude?"
30:28;30:29;"Jack just means like muscular."
30:29;30:30;"It was Jack."
30:30;30:31;"Oh, you're referring to yourself?"
30:31;30:33;"Right, because the people at home probably don't know that I'm Jack now."
30:33;30:37;"Wearing your blind melon tea, dude."
30:37;30:38;"I'm wearing a blind melon tea."
30:39;30:41;"Did you end up wearing that to the Grammys?"
30:41;30:42;"No, I kept it real mellow."
30:42;30:45;"More mellow than a blind melon tea?"
30:45;30:53;"I just wore like kind of a boring, dark, you know, like a dress shirt and jacket ensemble."
30:53;30:55;"So that's that."
30:55;31:00;"Another Jack muscular kind of macho guy who loved that song was Vin Diesel."
31:00;31:01;"You hear about this?"
31:01;31:02;"No."
31:02;31:03;"No."
31:03;31:08;"I was kind of like researching the song, you know, just like normal."
31:08;31:12;"Like music nerd stuff like who wrote it, how's it doing?"
31:12;31:13;"What label did it come out on?"
31:13;31:19;"And then so when I searched Kygo It Ain't Me, one of the first like news suggestions in Google"
31:19;31:23;"was like, ""Hear Vin Diesel's take on Kygo It Ain't Me."""
31:23;31:24;"And I was like, ""Click."""
31:24;31:29;"The bait has been laid and the fish has been cooked."
31:29;31:31;"""Hear Vin Diesel's take."""
31:31;31:33;"That is so random."
31:33;31:38;"I don't have all the info, but there was like a picture of Vin Diesel and Kygo together"
31:38;31:38;"in the studio."
31:38;31:42;"Vin Diesel obviously is like, he's a man about town."
31:42;31:44;"You know, it's not surprising."
31:44;31:45;"Vin Diesel knows everybody."
31:45;31:47;"He's the fricking man."
31:47;31:51;"So I see this picture of them in the studio and I'm like, ""Wow, that's wild."
31:51;31:55;"Maybe Vin teamed up with Kygo to do an alternate version."""
31:55;32:01;"And then I listened to it and it sounds more like, I guess Vin Diesel knows Kygo, but he"
32:01;32:05;"posted this version and he like wrote on the internet, ""Hey guys."""
32:05;32:06;"He has like a very deep voice."
32:07;32:11;"""Hey guys, you know, I'm really nervous about, you know, I don't sing, but this song really"
32:11;32:13;"moved me and I want to do something."""
32:13;32:13;"So anyway."
32:13;32:14;"Is he from South Jersey too?"
32:14;32:17;"I think he's from New York."
32:17;32:24;"So Vin Diesel posts this song and I was kind of expecting, okay, maybe Kygo gave him the"
32:24;32:25;"instrumental."
32:25;32:29;"Maybe he's like doing his own take, maybe did an alternate version, but then this is"
32:29;32:30;"what it sounds like."
32:30;32:30;"This is so weird."
32:30;32:30;"I know."
32:30;32:36;"Whistle."
32:36;32:37;"Okay, cool."
32:37;32:40;"That's delicate."

35:37;35:42;"So Vin Diesel, we found out he's just a huge Kygo fan."
35:42;35:43;"So maybe this was like,"
35:43;35:44;"he's not trying to do anything professional."
35:44;35:46;"He was just like, ""I love this song,"
35:46;35:47;"""and here's me singing over it."""
35:47;35:51;"Just kind of like a sweet gesture to a DJ he respects."
35:51;35:54;"So I was kind of like, I heard that,"
35:54;35:55;"and I was like, ""All right, me and Vin,"
35:55;35:59;"""just two jack dudes who both like--"""
35:59;36:00;"You're on the same page."
36:00;36:00;"We're on the same page."
36:00;36:01;"I was with him."
36:01;36:07;"And then I'm basically describing an internet rabbit hole."
36:07;36:07;"Yeah."
36:07;36:09;"Or K-hole, I don't know what people call it."
36:09;36:10;"'Cause basically I was like,"
36:10;36:11;"""I wanna learn about the song."""
36:11;36:12;"And then I see this clickbait."
36:12;36:15;"""Hear Vin Diesel sing the new Kygo Selene Gomez song."""
36:15;36:16;"Then I click on that."
36:16;36:18;"Now I'm thinking about Vin Diesel."
36:18;36:19;"So what's my next move?"
36:19;36:20;"What's his musical life?"
36:20;36:22;"I'm searching Vin Diesel, just seeing what he's up to."
36:22;36:25;"It turns out when he was a teenager,"
36:25;36:28;"he wasn't listening to the Libertines."
36:28;36:30;"He was growing up in the New York City area."
36:30;36:32;"He was listening to early hip hop."
36:32;36:36;"And I guess other kind of downtown music."
36:36;36:37;"He was in the scene."
36:37;36:38;"So when he was a teenager, it turns out--"
36:38;36:40;"What year was Vin Diesel born?"
36:40;36:41;"We gotta find that out."
36:41;36:43;"I think probably early '70s."
36:43;36:46;"I'm gonna say 1972."
36:46;36:47;"Holy cow!"
36:47;36:48;"'67."
36:48;36:50;"So he's 50."
36:50;36:51;"He's 49."
36:51;36:52;"He's gonna turn 50 this year."
36:52;36:57;"So Vin Diesel was born in 1967 in Alameda County, California."
36:57;36:58;"Oakland."
36:58;37:00;"Diesel has stated that he's of ambiguous ethnicity."
37:00;37:03;"His mother's background includes English, German, and Scottish."
37:03;37:06;"Classic American mix."
37:06;37:08;"But he's never met his biological father and has stated that,"
37:08;37:11;"""All I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures."""
37:11;37:15;"Diesel has self-identified as definitely a person of color."
37:15;37:16;"So that's interesting."
37:16;37:18;"He doesn't really know much about his father's side."
37:18;37:23;"But then they moved to New York and he was raised by his mom and his stepfather."
37:23;37:26;"His African-American stepfather, Irving H. Vincent,"
37:26;37:27;"an acting instructor and theater manager."
37:27;37:29;"So that's cool."
37:29;37:31;"So he's kind of like growing up downtown New York."
37:31;37:33;"Right, so he's 20 in '87."
37:33;37:34;"So he's 20 in '87."
37:34;37:39;"Some point when he's a teenager running around, you know, '80s New York,"
37:39;37:42;"got punk rock, hip hop, all these things,"
37:42;37:45;"he links up with a guy called Arthur Russell."
37:45;37:45;"What?"
37:45;37:46;"You guys know Arthur Russell, right?"
37:46;37:47;"Of course."
37:47;37:48;"Whoa."
37:48;37:48;"Love Arthur Russell."
37:48;37:52;"How would you guys describe Arthur Russell to the listeners who are not familiar?"
37:52;37:54;"He's like a Jack of all trades, kind of."
37:55;37:57;"Because he was doing like dance music."
37:57;38:03;"And he was also making like kind of sloppy lo-fi recordings of his songs."
38:03;38:03;"Kind of like..."
38:03;38:04;"He's a great cello player."
38:04;38:05;"Before indie was..."
38:05;38:07;"Well, also the cello too."
38:07;38:08;"He's a cellist."
38:08;38:13;"Yeah, so he was involved in like dance music, like '80s New York dance music."
38:13;38:17;"But also, I guess what you could call indie post-punk something."
38:17;38:17;"Yeah."
38:17;38:18;"He kind of..."
38:18;38:22;"I think at the time he was a little bit slept on and he died tragically young."
38:22;38:24;"So Arthur Russell is a super cool guy."
38:24;38:29;"And maybe in the past 15 years, he's become even more influential"
38:29;38:31;"because of like compilations and reissues and stuff."
38:31;38:36;"Like any indie musician is definitely like a fan or certainly familiar."
38:36;38:43;"So we found evidence that Vin Diesel linked up with Arthur Russell as a teenager."
38:43;38:48;"We got a shout out, Gary@garylucas.com, who's the dude who posted this on SoundCloud."
38:48;38:49;"Whoa."
38:49;38:50;"And this is how he described it."
38:50;38:56;"""These are fragments of an aborted recording session at Battery Sound, New York City, 1986,"
38:56;39:01;"which brought together fledgling rapper Mark Sinclair, today better known as the actor Vin"
39:01;39:07;"Diesel, and avant composer/dance music maven Arthur Russell in a project midwifed by Gary"
39:07;39:11;"Lucas,"" oh, there you go, ""who discovered Mark Sinclair rapping and break dancing on"
39:11;39:12;"the streets of the West Village."
39:12;39:20;"This project was greenlighted by Jeff Travis of Rough Trade Records and Barry Feldman,"
39:20;39:23;"of Upside/Logarithm Records."""
39:23;39:28;"I'd be remiss not to point out that Jeff Travis, who I guess footed the bill for this,"
39:28;39:31;"kind of a well-known guy who ran Rough Trade Records in England, signed the Smiths,"
39:31;39:37;"also put out The Libertines about 20 years later."
39:37;39:43;"So anyway, this guy Jeff Travis has had an eye for talent for 30 years, from Johnny Marr"
39:43;39:48;"and Morrissey to Vin Diesel to The Libertines and then The Strokes."
39:49;39:50;"So let's listen to some of this."
39:50;39:51;"This is like a weird tape."
39:52;39:55;"Ha ha, ha ha, party people trying to get stupid."
39:55;39:57;"Ha ha, sounds like him."
39:57;40:00;"Ha ha, yeah, you're actually here, Sinclair."
40:00;40:04;"So I'll tell you a little story here, it goes like, it goes like this."
40:04;40:18;"You knew this girl from junior high, she was bordering and she was fly."
40:18;40:23;"That's when I was kinda shy, chilling and moving a fabulous vibe."
40:23;40:28;"Now I used to buy as you all know, my name Papa Papa was a city boy."
40:28;40:34;"Well one night we were popping at DT and this girl told Ty that she liked me."
40:34;40:37;"Hit it on the loop and I played it cool."
40:37;40:38;"It was the same old old time."
40:38;40:41;"Definitely the beat has some of that Arthur Russell, like, echoey flavor."
40:41;40:46;"Let's skip around."
40:59;41:00;"Okay."
41:00;41:03;"Oh, he's getting directions."
41:17;41:19;"Okay, we get the idea."
41:19;41:24;"So anyway, to be fair to Vin Diesel, it's not just an actor who suddenly is getting"
41:24;41:26;"interested in music when he hears a good Kygo song."
41:26;41:30;"This guy, music's been a part of his life since he was a teenager."
41:30;41:33;"So weird, the Arthur Russell connection, that is so bizarre."
41:33;41:34;"He connected with everybody."
41:34;41:36;"Yeah, that's so cool."
41:36;41:40;"So you're Vin Diesel, breakdancing in the West Village."
41:40;41:41;"Fast and Furious 9."
41:41;41:48;"But so, you know, after listening to the Kygo song and the Arthur Russell song, I was very"
41:48;41:49;"pro Vin Diesel."
41:49;41:50;"Yeah."
41:50;41:52;"But then as I'm continuing to research."
41:52;41:53;"He's a Trump guy."
41:53;41:54;"No, he's not a Trump guy."
41:54;41:57;"But well, actually, I don't know."
41:57;41:58;"I doubt it."
41:58;41:59;"That'd be weird."
41:59;42:05;"It kind of seems like as two of the biggest stars in the Fast and Furious franchise, it"
42:05;42:08;"seems like some people, you have to either like Vin Diesel or like The Rock."
42:08;42:12;"And it turns out that they've had some skirmishes on the set."
42:12;42:12;"Okay."
42:12;42:15;"And The Rock's known to be a very level-headed guy, but he came out and made a statement"
42:15;42:23;"basically saying some people, I think he used the B word, are acting like bees on the set."
42:23;42:25;"And a lot of people were like, oh, he's talking about Vin Diesel."
42:25;42:26;"They don't like each other."
42:27;42:29;"He thinks Vin Diesel's like a diva, annoying."
42:29;42:33;"And The Rock is more like salt of the earth, knows how to treat people right."
42:33;42:36;"But I guess they're kind of positioned against each other."
42:36;42:37;"You like one or the other."
42:37;42:41;"And then I was checking on some of the latest press that Vin Diesel did."
42:41;42:44;"He was doing an interview in Brazil."
42:44;42:49;"And I started to be like, man, Vin Diesel needs to get it together because this is not"
42:49;42:49;"cool."
42:49;42:54;"So he was doing an interview in Brazil with a Brazilian female journalist."
42:54;42:54;"Okay."
42:54;42:54;"What year?"
42:54;42:56;"This year."
42:56;42:57;"Very recently."
42:57;42:58;"God, you're so beautiful."
42:58;43:00;"My God, she's so beautiful."
43:00;43:02;"Am I right or wrong?"
43:02;43:03;"Look at her."
43:03;43:05;"How am I supposed to do this interview?"
43:05;43:05;"It's pretty drunk."
43:05;43:06;"Look at this woman."
43:06;43:07;"Yeah, it's pretty drunk."
43:07;43:09;"She's so beautiful."
43:09;43:10;"Cognou, man."
43:10;43:11;"Talk to me, baby."
43:11;43:13;"Tell me your story."
43:13;43:14;"Tell me yours."
43:14;43:14;"Let's get out of here."
43:14;43:15;"Let's go."
43:15;43:16;"Let's go have lunch."
43:16;43:18;"My God, I love her."
43:18;43:19;"Look how beautiful she is."
43:19;43:20;"Thank you."
43:20;43:22;"God, wow."
43:22;43:24;"Also, I know this sounds like it's edited."
43:24;43:26;"He was pushing the point so far."
43:26;43:29;"I know it sounds like it's edited, but it's like when somebody's trying to do their job"
43:29;43:34;"interviewing you, I guess you could pay them a compliment about an article of clothing,"
43:34;43:39;"perhaps even to say that they're beautiful once is like unprofessional."
43:39;43:40;"Yeah."
43:40;43:41;"Did you?"
43:41;43:43;"I'm the Grouch."
43:43;43:43;"I'm the Grouch."
43:43;43:47;"I'm the Grouch."
43:47;43:50;"I love her."
43:50;43:52;"Man, she's so f****** sexy."
43:52;43:53;"I can't do this interview."
43:53;43:53;"Look at her."
43:54;43:56;"Does anyone say this?"
43:56;43:58;"Guys, what's wrong?"
43:58;43:59;"Am I the only one that's saying it?"
43:59;44:00;"Look at her."
44:00;44:03;"So Vin Diesel, man, apologize to that journalist."
44:03;44:07;"Get back to rapping and get your act together, man."
44:07;44:10;"People have joked about The Rock running for president."
44:10;44:15;"What if there's Vin Diesel's running for the Republicans, obviously, and The Rock is for"
44:15;44:16;"the Democrats?"
44:16;44:19;"That would be insane."
44:19;44:20;"The Rock is more jacked too."
44:20;44:21;"Yeah."
44:22;44:29;"Okay, so The Rock wrote a cryptic Instagram post because I hope people don't think I'm"
44:29;44:34;"just pulling out this beef out of thin air just because they're too bald headed jack"
44:34;44:35;"dudes in their 40s."
44:35;44:43;"So The Rock, who's always been known as like this super chill dude, posted an Instagram"
44:43;44:48;"where he wrote, ""This is my final week of shooting Fast and Furious 8."
44:48;44:52;"There's no other franchise that gets my blood boiling more than this one."""
44:52;44:54;"I love that."
44:54;44:58;"Then he went on to praise the crew and the female stars in the ensemble cast."
44:58;45:01;"So right there, you know there's about to be a turn."
45:01;45:07;"And then he turns around and says, ""My male co-stars, however, are a different story."
45:07;45:15;"Some conduct themselves as stand-up men and true professionals, while others don't."
45:16;45:21;"The ones that don't are too chickens to do anything about it anyway."""
45:21;45:23;"Wow, he's going in."
45:23;45:24;"Candy asses."
45:24;45:25;"Dude."
45:25;45:30;"When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I'm not acting in some of these"
45:30;45:33;"scenes and my blood is legit boiling, you're right."
45:33;45:39;"Bottom line is it'll play great for the movie and fits this Hobbes character that's embedded"
45:39;45:41;"in my DNA extremely well."
45:41;45:44;"The producer in me is happy about this part."
45:45;45:52;"""Final week on Fast 8 and I'll finish strong,"" he wrote, adding the hashtag #ZeroTolerance"
45:52;45:53;"for candy asses."
45:53;45:56;"I mean, shots fired."
45:56;45:58;"That's a long hashtag."
45:58;45:59;"Candy ass."
45:59;46:04;"Candy ass is a weird one."
46:04;46:06;"I think it's like you're soft."
46:06;46:08;"You don't have strength in your buttocks."
46:08;46:10;"I also like the part where he says chicken s--t."
46:10;46:13;"Chicken s--t is such a funny phrase too."
46:13;46:15;"He's too chicken s--t to do anything about it anyway."
46:15;46:17;"I'm pretty into chicken s--t as a phrase."
46:17;46:22;"I bet that Vin Diesel was kind of acting weird, maybe disrespecting the crew."
46:22;46:22;"Maybe disrespecting--"
46:22;46:24;"Just being a punk, probably, dude."
46:24;46:27;"Maybe disrespecting some of the female crew."
46:27;46:30;"I'm picturing the craft services table."
46:30;46:32;"Yeah, he's just getting some potato salad and just sees--"
46:32;46:33;"""Oh, you're beautiful."
46:33;46:34;"You're beautiful."
46:34;46:36;"How am I supposed to eat this potato salad?"
46:36;46:37;"Are you kidding me?"
46:37;46:41;"I'm supposed to eat this potato salad and go back and film Fast and Furious 8?"
46:41;46:41;"Look at her."
46:42;46:43;"Are you kidding me?"""
46:43;46:45;"And then Rock hears that."
46:45;46:47;"That is a candy ass move."
46:47;46:52;"Yeah, Rock is like, ""Do not disrespect the female crew!"""
46:52;46:54;"He's like, ""I'm not disrespecting her, Rock."
46:54;46:54;"Dwayne."
46:54;46:57;"Dwayne, I'm not disrespecting her."
46:57;46:58;"She's beautiful."
46:58;46:58;"Look at her."
46:58;47:02;"She might be an attractive woman, man, but you can't talk to her that way."""
47:02;47:04;"And then Vin Diesel probably--"
47:04;47:06;"Because Vin Diesel maybe just walked away and was like, ""Whatever."
47:06;47:07;"I could kick your ass."""
47:07;47:08;"And the Rock is like, ""Oh, yeah?"
47:08;47:09;"Then why are you walking away?"""
47:10;47:14;"He's too much of a smooth operator businessman to just come out and be like, ""You know what,"
47:14;47:14;"guys?"
47:14;47:19;"I just rapped on Fast and Furious 8, and I gotta say, it was an awful experience, and"
47:19;47:20;"I don't know if I can do it anymore."
47:20;47:23;"Particularly because of the actions of some of my male co-stars who don't know how to"
47:23;47:26;"treat people, who are rude, arrogant, whatever."
47:26;47:27;"Honestly, it was--"
47:27;47:29;"Instead, he flips it into a positive."
47:29;47:32;"He's like, ""Some of these punks don't know how to act."
47:32;47:39;"And when you go see FF8 in theaters, and you see my incredible performance full of passion"
47:39;47:41;"and rage, it's real."""
47:41;47:45;"And then he goes, ""The producer in me loves it."""
47:45;47:46;"""The producer in me."""
48:00;48:02;"Complex plans and high ideals"
48:02;48:05;"But he treats people poorly"
48:05;48:11;"Is his ceaseless ambitiousness proxy for reward?"
48:11;48:12;"He's ignoring"
48:12;48:18;"How good we could have it if we were together"
48:18;48:24;"I feel love should be enough to get it easily done"
48:25;48:32;"Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar and better ourselves"
48:32;48:36;"We could be so good if we work together"
48:36;48:42;"Work together"
48:42;48:43;"Work together"

48:50;48:51;"Work together"
48:53;48:55;"Crippling fear, a selling doubt"
48:55;48:58;"So she blankers her vision"

49:18;49:25;"Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar and better ourselves"

49:53;49:55;"Work together"
49:56;50:03;"We haven't talked about politics in the past few weeks. I'm glad that we reminded people a little"
50:03;50:09;"bit that we're living in a fascist state. It's getting worse. It's horrible. And that if we don't"
50:09;50:16;"do more, we might be looking at a diesel presidency. It could happen. I wonder if we'll get a truly I'm"
50:16;50:22;"not kidding at all. If we truly will get a celebrity versus celebrity. I think so. Presidential race,"
50:22;50:26;"because you know how like there's been this stuff with like Trump and Schwarzenegger, like Trump is"
50:26;50:31;"still tweeting about the ratings. Yeah, yeah. I mean, to be fair, Schwarzenegger is no hero. He's"
50:31;50:36;"a Republican, but I get a picture that now based on what we know now, how horrible things are."
50:36;50:42;"Imagine if Trump had come out and instead of the Democrats being like, well, we're gonna run a"
50:42;50:48;"well-known kind of moderate Democrat who kind of has a lot of experience, who's been in the White"
50:48;50:53;"House, you know, like reasonable things. Yeah. We can critique Hillary all we want, but like they"
50:53;51:01;"tried to counter the madness of Trump, the celebrity with like a true civil servant. And maybe"
51:01;51:05;"now they'll be like next time there's like a Trump, they'd be like, can we get Schwarzenegger?"
51:06;51:14;"Can we get Alec Baldwin? Oh my, yo, that's crazy. Could you imagine? Honestly, I can imagine. That"
51:14;51:18;"would be like, we are living in a simulation. If Alec Baldwin threw his hat in the ring."
51:18;51:22;"And he's like really serious during the debate and then just out of nowhere, he just busts out"
51:22;51:26;"the impression. And then Trump's like, okay, very funny. It doesn't even sound like me. And he's"
51:26;51:30;"like, okay, very funny. Doesn't like that could happen on the national stage. I know you are,"
51:30;51:34;"but what am I? Exactly. Like what are some other ones besides Diesel and The Rock? It could be"
51:34;51:40;"the Republicans are like, we're running Garth Brooks. We're going to clean up. We're going to"
51:40;51:45;"mop the floor with you losers. And then Garth comes out and it's just like, oh, don't worry."
51:45;51:51;"I'm not as crazy as a, as Trump, but then like Loki he's doing like, and then the Democrats are"
51:51;51:55;"like, who do we run against Garth Brooks? I bet the first name that comes up Springsteen. Oprah"
51:55;52:00;"or Oprah. Oh yeah. That's come up. No, but I'm saying like, I want to like keeping it in like"
52:00;52:08;"the genre. This is a funny fantasy. I mean, Bruce would never do it, but draft Bruce, the great"
52:08;52:13;"draft Bruce campaign of 2023. So I feel like a lot of the democratic celebrities are they're like,"
52:13;52:17;"they're rational and they're not crazy. So they're like, yeah, I'm not going to run."
52:17;52:20;"Well, they're rational because they never would have thought they could have won. Now they might"
52:20;52:26;"think they could win. We're going to get more kind of like narcissistic Democrat celebrities"
52:26;52:31;"throwing their hat in the ring. Oh, yo kid rock versus the rock. Wow. Yeah. Republicans,"
52:31;52:37;"Republicans, 2024. Oh, kid. Rock's a huge Republican. Marley man. What's his problem?"
52:37;52:43;"Yo. All right. How about this kid rock? There's Eminem governor of Michigan. Oh,"
52:43;52:49;"it may be like depressing. I'm just picturing like Michigan becomes like this real, like"
52:49;52:54;"battleground for some reason. Well, it is, it already is. Oh yeah. No, I mean, it already is"
52:54;52:59;"like what's happening in Flint. So, so Michigan become, there's like, there's like a civil war"
52:59;53:04;"in Michigan. The whole nation's eyes are on who's going to become the governor of Michigan."
53:04;53:08;"Kid rocks running. He's leading in the polls. The Democrats are running like"
53:08;53:14;"Todd Williamson, like a local Congressman or something. And he's just like getting crushed."
53:14;53:21;"And then just one day out of nowhere, a new song comes on soundcloud and it's Eminem"
53:21;53:30;"announcing his candidacy for governor of Michigan in a speed rap. The Democrat bows out and then"
53:30;53:36;"it's just kid rock versus Eminem. It's really going to happen. It's hard to imagine that. Yeah."
53:36;53:44;"The celebrity won't that strain won't go further. Oh yeah. Trump broke the seal on that. I mean,"
53:44;53:49;"Reagan broke the seal. Right. Right. But he had to take it so slow. You'd have like decades."
53:50;53:56;"I wonder if we'll ever get a truly jacked president. Dude, Obama. Obama was in great"
53:56;53:59;"shape. I want a president. Obama was more jacked than you dude. Yeah, debatable."
53:59;54:06;"Now that's, that's debatable. I want a president with a good team. Is Obama more jacked than me?"
54:06;54:12;"Not really. No. Okay. Obama's in great shape. Obama's probably the, in the best shape of any"
54:12;54:18;"president ever. Dude, don't sleep on W. Dude worked out for an hour a day. Really? I guess."
54:18;54:25;"W was older, but dude was like, was he had some guns under there? Yeah. He was toned bro. Really?"
54:25;54:32;"Yeah. When I picture like, like president era W with his shirt off. Dude, I don't think he's"
54:32;54:38;"pretty. He's like going down his clearing brush and cross. He's like working on his core, dude."
54:38;54:43;"Do you think he had like visible abs? Yeah, I do. I really do. Really?"
54:46;54:52;"W side. There's never been a president with the, with like, say like the bulk of,"
54:52;54:56;"of a rock of like the rock. Well, most of the time they're old, but yeah."
54:56;54:59;"Yeah. Maybe they're just too old. I mean, yeah. Schwarzenegger was governor."
54:59;55:06;"Right. Yeah. Schwarzenegger. That's funny that he was governor. Dude. And Jesse Ventura was governor."
55:06;55:12;"Oh, well, Jesse Ventura is, I don't even know. Dude, groundwork's been laid. Ventura, Schwarzenegger."
55:13;55:16;"Wrestler slash action. Maybe it will be the rock."
55:16;55:22;"It's just been eight for the eight days since our restart went."
55:22;55:37;"Thought we'd invest and say, but it's all rigged a gamble."
55:37;55:42;"Oh, no way. Fighting. We can't."
55:42;55:58;"Cause you and me are the same. Now I'm shining. And you're shining."
55:58;56:00;"And you're shining."
56:01;56:10;"But our diamonds blooded. Nickel, diamond, silver. No trophy, no cake. Winner take not fair."
56:10;56:22;"I want it all. And I want it more."
56:23;56:27;"Maybe I want it all. And when you no longer."
56:27;56:38;"I built my life around our love to ground your dream."
56:38;56:45;"I am so tired, but I never could give you enough."
56:48;56:55;"Fighting. We can only lose. Winner take nothing."
56:55;57:01;"Killing me and killing you. Cause you and me are the same."
57:01;57:06;"Now I'm shining like tears in the rain. And you're shining like the fear of fate."
57:06;57:16;"But our diamonds blooded. Nickel, diamond, silver. No trophy, no cake. Winner take nothing."
57:17;57:25;"Winner take nothing. Winner take nothing."
57:25;57:38;"Winner take. You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
57:38;57:41;"On the last episode, we had a fascinating conversation with some of the good folks at"
57:41;57:49;"Play Network. These are the people who help craft playlists for retail spaces. And Jake,"
57:49;57:52;"you had some pretty critical things to say about the music that you hear when you're"
57:52;57:58;"shopping at Home Depot. It's just basically like the top five of iTunes. It's Chainsmokers."
57:58;58:03;"It's like Justin Timberlake song from the Troll soundtrack. Oh, that's a good song. It's"
58:03;58:10;"just like, you know, the same pop music you hear everywhere. And for some reason, in my mind,"
58:10;58:16;"Home Depot is like something special. You're like a 40 year old dude buying a toilet seat, right?"
58:16;58:22;"It's not Chainsmokers, dude. It's like it's like the tasteful side of contractor rock."
58:22;58:29;"OK, well, I made my own playlist for which I think we should send on. OK, but wait, have we talked"
58:29;58:34;"about contractor rock as a genre yet? No, you're you're getting way ahead. So the reason we're"
58:34;58:39;"talking about this is because Jake made a Home Depot playlist that you can listen to via Apple"
58:39;58:44;"Music on the Time Crisis show page. Yeah. On Time Crisis, we post the playlist of what we played on"
58:44;58:49;"the show. But, you know, there's a super random show. Yeah. So a Time Crisis playlist is like"
58:49;58:56;"probably not good just to throw on like at a barbecue or something. If you're going to Lowe's."
58:56;59:00;"Yeah, definitely not if you're going to Lowe's. So Jake made a Home Depot playlist. So OK, so you"
59:00;59:07;"this is what you wrote for the website. Jake's Dream, colon Home Depot playlist,"
59:08;59:13;"the tasteful side of contractor rock music that could theoretically be played in Home Depot"
59:13;59:17;"and dramatically improve the shopping experience in keeping with the Play Network concept of upbeat,"
59:17;59:23;"relatively positive vibes. OK, so Dave asked a great question. What is contractor rock?"
59:23;59:32;"OK, a.k.a. like job site rock. So like there's there's some dudes putting up like the Tyvek"
59:32;59:36;"wrapping on the side of like a new house that they've just framed out. Right. There's like"
59:36;59:44;"a boom box as blasting like Van Halen and ACDC, KLOS and GNR Metallica. Exactly. You're"
59:44;59:50;"picturing like a suburban white, like middle aged contractor. Yeah. And just straight up classic rock."
59:50;59:54;"That's not what I want played at the Home Depot. What I want is something a little gentler,"
59:54;01:00:00;"something that's a little more tasteful. You don't want to hear something that's not hard rock"
01:00:00;01:00:06;"because like you don't want to hear like ACDC and Guns N' Roses. That's hard rock. That's too heavy."
01:00:06;01:00:10;"I don't want to hear hard rock. I don't want to hear metal, but I don't want to hear soft rock"
01:00:10;01:00:14;"either. I want to hear just Christopher Cross. I just want to hear like rock,"
01:00:14;01:00:24;"sort of like fairly melodic, sort of mid-tempo, tasteful, classy rock. So let me see. So"
01:00:24;01:00:28;"you started with Badfinger. So you enter Home Depot."
01:00:31;01:00:38;"The guy smiles at you. Mr. Longstrip, welcome back. This sounds kind of British."
01:00:38;01:00:46;"Yeah, I think we're British. That doesn't get me. British bands are like 2x4s. British bands are,"
01:00:46;01:00:51;"they're just rock bands from Britain. Yeah, but isn't Home Depot like all American? That sounds"
01:00:51;01:00:56;"like that Tom Hanks movie. Which one? It's where he plays the manager. Oh, that thing you do? Yeah."
01:00:57;01:01:03;"It's Badfinger. So you also picked Big Star. They're American. Relatively obscure. Yeah,"
01:01:03;01:01:09;"I wanted to sneak in a few gems that you wouldn't hear. I don't know why Big Star's not on classic"
01:01:09;01:01:14;"rock radio. They should be. Yeah, it's one of those weird things. It's like, in what aisle"
01:01:14;01:01:21;"would I find the grout? That would totally work. I feel this. Look, I'm trying to mount like a"
01:01:21;01:01:25;"metal shelving bracket to like a concrete pillar. Do I need like a masonry bit for that? You know"
01:01:25;01:01:30;"what? I'm going to refer you to my associate Marsha. She will have better information on that."
01:01:30;01:01:35;"Okay, so I have like a Nikita impact driver. Do you think if I just put a masonry bit in that I"
01:01:35;01:01:40;"could... Oh Nikita, that's a hell of an impact. Oh, do I have to actually rent a hammer drill from you?"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Okay, you got some Bob Dylan Man in me."
01:01:42;01:01:50;"Isn't this more like, this is more like local hardware store. This is more like... Exactly."
01:01:51;01:02:00;"Hey, this is like small town. Hey Fred, hey Jake, how did that wall mounted..."
01:02:00;01:02:08;"How did the wall mounting work out? It's like a dream Fred, this new, my new Nikita..."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"Oh, Nikita impact driver?"
01:02:25;01:02:34;"I'd like you to get through to the man in me."
01:02:34;01:02:41;"Storm clouds are raging all around my door."
01:02:41;01:02:47;"I think to myself I might not take it anymore."
01:02:47;01:02:55;"Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me."
01:02:55;01:03:23;"If never I met you,"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"If never I met you,"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"If not for a first hello,"
01:03:30;01:03:35;"We never have to say goodbye."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"If never I met you,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"My baby's a blue-blue man."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"It's how my stars were born."
01:03:45;01:03:49;"That's so much you'll never know."
01:03:49;01:03:55;"I think to myself I might not take it anymore."
01:03:55;01:04:01;"Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me."
01:04:01;01:04:05;"If never I met you,"
01:04:05;01:04:09;"If not for a first hello,"
01:04:09;01:04:13;"We never have to say goodbye."
01:04:13;01:04:18;"Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me."
01:04:18;01:04:22;"If never I met you,"
01:04:22;01:04:26;"My baby's a blue-blue man."
01:04:26;01:04:30;"It's how my stars were born."
01:04:30;01:04:34;"That's so much you'll never know."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"It's how my stars were born."
01:04:54;01:04:58;"There were beverages"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"Laid out for the party."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"There were candy and spices"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"And tricolor costumes."
01:05:07;01:05:13;"Cork was drunk from succulent juices."
01:05:13;01:05:17;"So I had to turn around."
01:05:17;01:05:21;"And go to the home depot."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Sam Hunt, ""Body Like a Back Road"""
01:26:51;01:26:55;"I'll give you one guess what genre."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Sam Hunt, ""Body Like a Back Road"""
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Body like a back road."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"No, it's actually a tropical house. Back road is like a Swedish..."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"No, I'm just kidding. Of course it's country."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Ooh, I already like this."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"It's got those snaps."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Got a girl from the south side."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Got braids in her hair."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"First time I seen her walk by."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"And I about fell up out my chair."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Had to get her number."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"It took me like six weeks."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Oh, he's got a rapper."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"To get her go way back."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Like Cadillac seats."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Body like a back road."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Driving with my eyes closed."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"I know every curve."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Like the back of my hand."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"Gotcha."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"I was like, what do you mean backward?"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"Like kind of dusty and gravelly?"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Real coarse."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Just as fast as I can."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Oh, I should bring them blue jeans."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"She don't need no help."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Oh, nice tambo."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Second verse."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"But I can turn them inside out."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"I don't need no help."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"So thick and so sweet."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"So sweet."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Ain't no curves like hers."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Down town streets."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Body like a back road."

01:28:17;01:28:19;"I know every curve."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Like the back of my hand."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Going 15 in a 30."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"I ain't in no hurry."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"I'm gonna take it slow."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Just as fast as I can."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Okay, I'm starting to see a theme"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"in the 2017 songs."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Yeah?"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"They're both kind of like"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"small moments about"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"personal connection."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Like the Coldplay one is about like,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"""Hey, I'm nothing fancy,"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"but it really means a lot to me"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"that I'm what you need."""
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Maybe it's like in this big crazy world"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"we're looking for little stories"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"of people who can just come together"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"in small ways."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Like the Coldplay song to me"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"very clearly takes place in like a"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"ranch house. Like a suburban ranch house."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"It's just like, it doesn't take place"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"at a nightclub. It's just kind of like"

01:40:39;01:40:41;"Is it like a shrimp scampi?"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Yeah."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"As opposed to a roast beef scampi?"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"What are you thinking?"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"Wait, are there different kinds of scampi besides shrimp?"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"I thought it was a type of..."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"What is a shrimp scampi?"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Why is it not scampi shrimp?"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"[laughter]"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Julio, get that scampi."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Scampi includes various culinary preparations"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"of certain crustaceans."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Okay, so not exclusively shrimp."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Yeah, there's"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"a similar lobster."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"You have a clam."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"So scampi is a preparation."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"That's why it comes at the end."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"It's like a European preparation."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"Like chicken a la king."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Like a white wine sauce or something?"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Yeah, but then they have"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"like a fried scampi."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"I just gotta say,"

01:41:41;01:41:43;"Maybe."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Yeah, maybe some of them."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"I'm just saying, that's what I like. That's good times music."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"And look, there's always use for good times music,"

01:42:27;01:42:29;"Yeah, this feels real retro."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Like, trying to do"

01:42:59;01:43:01;"Oh, interesting."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"You know what's funny?"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"Sometimes when it does rain in LA,"

01:50:23;01:50:25;"of sheeting and bedding."
01:50:25;01:50:27;"""And now my Eames chair"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"smells like you."""
01:50:29;01:50:31;"Bottom line,"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Ed Sheeran, this is a lustful song."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"I'm not judging it."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"While we're here, I know that we're"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"blasting through the top five, but in the second"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"verse, he uses some language"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"that is real specific."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"Okay, let's get on here."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"That is a very specific verse."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"I gotta say,"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"when he says, ""We went to an all-you-can-eat place"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"and we talked about the sweet and the sour,"""
01:51:15;01:51:17;"that just makes me think about"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"being at some giant buffet."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Maybe this says more about me that I just"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"don't have good impulse control at buffets,"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"but I'm picturing"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"sitting down,"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Ed Sheeran is just like"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"pork fried rice,"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"egg rolls, shrimp scampi,"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"sweet and sour chicken,"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"large fountain drink."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"[laughter]"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"64-ounce Pepsi."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Which, I'm saying, is a beautiful thing to share"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"with a loved one. All that sounds good."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"But then getting in-- -It's like the second date."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"-Second date, and then you're getting in the cab"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"and starting to make out on the way home."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"If I was with a beautiful"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"woman in this early"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"first few weeks kind of thing--"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"-You're taking it easy on the wontons."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"-I wouldn't go to an all-you-can-eat place, but he's saying they wanted"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"a good value, I guess."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"-Well, it sounds like an adventurous, organic"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"evening where you're"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"drinking, it's late,"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"everything's open, it's the all-you-can-eat Chinese."
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Let's hit that."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"-And we talked about the sweet and the sour"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"and how your family's doing okay."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"When I first heard that line, I gotta admit, I was a little"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"like, ""That's a dumb line."" But now that"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"I think about it more, and I really do"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"respect Ed Sheeran, maybe"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"he's actually trying to"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"say, ""So we're sitting at the Chinese buffet,"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"and frankly, there's not a whole lot"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"to talk about, because both of us just want to get"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"home and get it on."""
01:52:35;01:52:37;"-Yeah. -'Cause actually,"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"those lines sound like"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"filler, unless he's trying to describe"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"sitting at the Chinese buffet and being like,"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"""So we're sitting there, trying to talk, trying to be on"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"a normal date."" -Right. -And so I'm like,"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"""Sweet and sour chicken's pretty good."" And she's like, ""Yeah."""
01:52:49;01:52:51;"And he's like, ""How's your family?"" ""They're okay."""
01:52:51;01:52:53;"""Interesting."""
01:52:53;01:52:55;"-Right. -Um, ""Hey,"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"do you want to go back to my place?"" ""I thought you'd never ask."""
01:52:57;01:52:59;"-No, 'cause he's saying-- -Let's go do it, man."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"-We talked for hours and hours."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"-Oh, that destroys that."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Or maybe he's still nervous. He's like,"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"""Uh, we had, like, incredible sex."""
01:53:07;01:53:09;"-Sometimes those conversations can go on for hours."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"-Right. Maybe because nobody"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"wants to cut to the chase. -You're trying to close a deal,"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"but it takes four hours. -Well, this-- I assume this"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"is not the-- Oh, maybe it was their first date."

01:53:39;01:53:41;"Man, he's on his first date,"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"and they don't really have that much to talk about."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"It's a little awkward. They don't know each other at all."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"-So you're giving him-- I think that's an interesting read,"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"that he's specifically, like,"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"illustrating the fact that the conversation"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"was boring, where the energy was"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"was not in the conversation."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"-I will give Ed Sheeran-- be charitable enough"

01:53:59;01:54:01;"just randomly throw in, like, ""And how your family's doing?"""
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Okay? The fact that it's the first date"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"makes it all kind of come together to me."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"-Right. -First date."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"-They can't really-- they can't find the words. -We're both kind of broke."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"Or he doesn't say we're broke. He says we're thrifty."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Is this, like, rich, current Ed Sheeran?"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Maybe he still is thrifty."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Imagine you go on your first date."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"-I like-- I like that he-- -You get set up on a blind date"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"with Ed Sheeran, and you're just like,"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"""Oh, my God, that's crazy."" And your friends are like,"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"""Can you imagine if you, like, married him?"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"You'd be, like, a freaking billionaire."""
01:54:27;01:54:29;"And then he's like, ""So I started dating Ed Sheeran,"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"and I'm a billionaire."" And then he's like,"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"""So I say we just hit the all-you-can-eat"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"Chinese buffet."""
01:54:35;01:54:37;"I like that he's trying to make a--"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"like, a joke."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"He's like, ""We're thrifty, so you fill up your bag."""
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Oh, he said, ""You fill up your bag."""
01:54:43;01:54:45;"-Yeah. -And I fill up my plate."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"But it seems like the joke is at her expense,"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"which is, like, working against him."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Well, he's reflecting on it now,"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"so maybe they're comfortable with each other now."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"-It's confusing. -That's a good read on the song, man."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"That would not have occurred to me."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"He was presenting the conversation as, like,"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"this was, like, a deep conversation."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"There's only one way to find out."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"And I feel like your read of it"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"is so layered and nuanced."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"I'm trying to be a charitable person,"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"you know, in 2017. There's enough hatred"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"in the world that"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"I'm always gonna look for the..."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"the good. Speaking of"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Ed Sheeran and his attention to detail,"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"and he really does have-- he truly is an interesting"

01:55:23;01:55:25;"Hariharan-- I'm not sure"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"if I'm pronouncing it correctly, but Satya"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"emailed Jake,"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"I think, right? It was an email, right?"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"-Oh, yeah, yeah. -So, Satya emailed Jake."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"As always, if you can track down Jake's email,"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"you can always get a Time Crisis"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"email through. -Super hard to find it."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"-Super hard to find it. And"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"Satya said, ""Ed Sheeran sung 'Galway Girl'"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"on the new album,"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"the same one as 'Shape of You.'"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"There's a line, 'I walked her home, then she took me"

01:55:53;01:55:55;"Doritos."

01:55:57;01:55:59;"nacho cheese."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"-Doritos and wine."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"Satya asked, ""What's our"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"take on the song lyrics, and what wine would you pair"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"with the different flavors of Doritos?"""
01:56:07;01:56:09;"You know what? -That's a great question."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"-You know what? Ed Sheeran, like,"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"I guess he's younger, he's like mid-twenties,"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"but that does make me think of, like,"
01:56:15;01:56:19;"those kind of, like, funny situations"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"where you, like, randomly find yourself,"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"like, somebody invites you to their apartment,"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"and they're, like, nervous. Something about the"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"pairing of Doritos, I'm being super, super charitable"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"to Ed Sheeran today, but when"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"I picture, like, the pairing of Doritos and another bottle of"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"wine, that reminds me of just being,"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"like... -It's like college."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"-Yeah, college, maybe a little"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"earlier, maybe a little bit later, but"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"like, whatever, between"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"seventeen and"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"twenty-six. Just being"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"in that zone where you might go to somebody's house"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"and you're, like, and everybody's still nervous,"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"and they're just like, ""Um,"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"you wanna drink something?"" And you're just like,"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"""Uh, sure."" And then they're like, you're like, ""What do"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"you have?"" And they're just like, ""Um,"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"oh, I got this, like, half-drunk, like,"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"bottle of wine."" You're like, ""I'm down."""
01:57:01;01:57:03;"And then they, like, put out some Doritos. You just have, like, this weird, random"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"kind of awkward"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"combo. That's what that connects"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"to me. -He probably lived that moment."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"The Doritos and the wine."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"-Yeah, 'cause he could've said something"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"else. That implies some"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"sort of hodgepodge. -That's a tough word to sing."
01:57:17;01:57:19;"[Dan laughs]"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Doritos. -We don't have"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"time to listen to him sing it, but I can imagine."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"-Doritos. -I hope it's"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"a ballad. That'd be sick."

01:57:33;01:57:45;"-Cool ranch. -Anyway,"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"that was the Top 5. Congratulations to"

01:57:49;01:57:51;"[Dan laughs] For holding it down"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"in the number one slots in 1981"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"and 2017."
01:57:55;01:57:59;"Well, guys, that was a hell of a show."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"Dave, thanks for coming here."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"-Thanks for having me on. -Don't forget, everybody,"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Dirty Projectors."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"11 records in stores now."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"How many Dirty Projectors albums are there?"

01:58:15;01:58:17;"-Depends how you count it. -Plus the"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"Dave Longstreth first album."
01:58:19;01:58:21;"Debatably part of the Dirty Projectors"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"canon. -It's in there."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"And the American people."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"-And American people. -Unreleased."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"Angry Youth. There'll be a box set at some point."
01:58:29;01:58:31;"-The one last thing we gotta say is earlier"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"in the show we were talking about Vin Diesel."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"And for legal reasons, we gotta clear this up,"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"we strongly implied"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"that Vin Diesel is a Republican"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"or at the very least would run as a Republican."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"Our"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"R&D department got back to us"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"and said that"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"Vin Diesel has never come out as a Republican."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"In fact, he's expressed"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"a lot of admiration for Obama."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"And in fact, he likes Obama so much that he went out of"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"his way to say that his dream"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"would be to play Obama"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"in a biopic. -Whoa."
01:59:01;01:59:03;"-That's a pretty cool idea."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"A President Obama movie."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"Vin Diesel. -Jacked."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"-Jacked. Then we finally get a jacked"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"president. He's a great actor."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"-Oliver Stone directs. -Oliver Stone."
01:59:13;01:59:15;"-Obama. -Obama."
01:59:15;01:59:17;"-Have you seen Barry? -No, is that the one"
01:59:17;01:59:19;"where he's young? -Yeah. -Is it good? -I haven't seen it."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"-Wait, isn't there another one that's called like"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"a walk-in... -Yeah, there's two Obama"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"movies from last year. -There's like a romantic one."
01:59:25;01:59:27;"-That one is Michelle and Barack's first date."
01:59:27;01:59:29;"-First date. -That's sweet."
01:59:29;01:59:31;"-They hit a Chinese buffet. -They hit a Chinese buffet."
01:59:31;01:59:33;"-In my minivan"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"smells like you. -I'm in love"
