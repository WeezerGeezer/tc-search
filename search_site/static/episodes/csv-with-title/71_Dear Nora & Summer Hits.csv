00:02;00:09;"Time Crisis, here once again. Jake and I return to the studio to reflect"
00:09;00:16;"on our weekend in Ojai, our legendary weekend. We also talked to Dear Nora's Katie Davidson"
00:16;00:25;"about their new album and when they first met Jake in college in Portland. This is kind of"
00:25;00:35;"a different tone for the intro but anyway this is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. Beats one."
00:37;01:04;"Time Crisis back once again. Back from Ojai. I guess we should talk about the Ojai shows a"
01:04;01:09;"little bit. Yeah. At this point they were two weeks ago but hell of a weekend. It was a great"
01:09;01:14;"weekend. For people who don't know Richard Pictures, Jake's Grateful Dead cover band and"
01:14;01:19;"Vampire Weekend played two shows together. That was kind of the Vampire Weekend's kickoff after"
01:19;01:24;"not having played live in a long time. Crowds were great and I gotta say I love playing during the"
01:24;01:29;"day because we played Saturday night and then Sunday morning. And the Saturday night show was"
01:29;01:36;"we played at 6 p.m. Yeah so it's more of like a late afternoon show. Late afternoon in a morning"
01:36;01:42;"show. Yeah Sunday morning we had to be there at 8 30 a.m. for sound check. That was a first. That's"
01:42;01:48;"brutal. Did you make it at 8 30? I was there at 8 15. Wow. Had a breakfast sandwich, cup of coffee,"
01:48;01:54;"I was ready to go. Yeah that was a great vibe just like it was a good backstage vibe there. Oh yeah."
01:54;01:58;"We had so many like friends and family around. Food was on point. Shout out to Beacon Coffee in"
01:58;02:04;"Ojai. They set up a little stand. I also love that just like on the Sunday show just sipping"
02:04;02:09;"a coffee in between songs. Oh yeah. Feeling good. Saturday night I was doing a little tequila between"
02:09;02:14;"songs. Yeah. Sunday morning doing some coffee. Doing some coffee. I definitely want to do more."
02:14;02:23;"I think that's the I want to do the Vampire Weekend patented weekend show concept. We play"
02:23;02:28;"Saturday night Sunday morning. That's strong. Tequila and coffee. We could we could we could"
02:28;02:36;"we'll get get a sponsorship from both. Tequila and coffee tour. Gotta finish the album now."
02:36;02:40;"It may be a little bit off in the future but we'll definitely do it. What are you like half"
02:40;02:46;"done with the album? About I just I just feel like I need to write a few more songs. I think"
02:46;02:52;"I might go to down to Mexico for a couple weeks get some inspo. So we're looking like a mid 2020"
02:52;03:00;"release on that record. Yeah definitely the next president. Trump's second term. Oh god no we got"
03:00;03:06;"hope. Um no it's very close to being done but finishing records is truly one of my least"
03:06;03:12;"favorite things to do. What is it so many details and like second guessing like what's the? Well"
03:12;03:16;"it's kind of like I think the things that I do well or the things that I like to do that I care"
03:16;03:24;"about a lot of like songwriting arrangement conceptual things. Right. Singing. I like the"
03:24;03:29;"micro details of songwriting and I like the big picture details of production and arrangement."
03:29;03:35;"You know I love to be working with a producer and be kind of like no we should rethink this the song"
03:35;03:38;"should be tight and dry and the drum should be like this. What I don't like is getting really"
03:38;03:42;"into the weeds which is what you have to do at the end. And this is what I'm listening to like"
03:42;03:47;"literally sometimes I mean RL bust my balls because we literally have songs where because"
03:47;03:52;"you know you have to save the a new version every time you restart Pro Tools. Oh wow. Well you know"
03:52;03:56;"just to for you just to be diligent because what if you needed to go back to a version. Right so"
03:56;04:03;"save as. There's songs where I think there's like 150 to 200 versions. That's insane. How do you"
04:03;04:07;"even like. Well you know. Parse that out. You hope you don't have to go back to it but that's why"
04:07;04:13;"it's a lot of data. So you're just chewing through hard drives. Oh yeah man terabytes. Good lord."
04:13;04:20;"Like mining Bitcoin over there. Basically. Cooking the earth. God we probably should have."
04:20;04:26;"Back where back I used to front lock and go out mechanics bug anchorage and Dar es Salaam."
04:26;04:34;"Well only New York with champagne and disco. Take some M&A slash San Francisco. But actually Oakland"
04:34;04:40;"and Alameda. Your girl was in Berkeley with a communist reader. Mine was in town with a boombox"
04:40;04:47;"and Walkman. I was a horrible girl that was back then. But yeah you have to do all this stuff at"
04:47;04:53;"this point where and I've always hated this on every album where you know the song is good. You"
04:53;04:57;"know the arrangements good. You know that the conceptual production is good. But now I'm"
04:57;05:01;"listening to it I'm just like wait are people going to know it. Did the vocal get too quiet"
05:01;05:06;"there. People can be weirded out. Or does that sit well. Does it get a little harsh. Get a little"
05:06;05:11;"too mid rangy like those kind of real micro details which. And then you're so in and you"
05:11;05:15;"take a step back. But yeah. So now I have this real strong feeling when we were driving back"
05:15;05:22;"from Ohio and it was a really fun weekend like the shows were great. Great crew of people. We"
05:22;05:28;"had after party on Saturday night. We had a barbecue with great tacos. That was huge. On Sunday people"
05:28;05:35;"flew in from New York. It was just amazing. Then Monday ripping back to L.A. Rashid and Despot in"
05:35;05:40;"the car talking about life. I was just kind of looking out the window and I was like I really"
05:40;05:48;"have this sense of accomplishment where I was like man we really did it. We crushed Ohio. We"
05:48;05:55;"crushed Ohio for the weekend. And then I started to realize that my work had barely even begun."
05:55;05:58;"I had this sense of exhaustion from working on the album so long. And even you know it was like"
05:58;06:07;"a fun weekend. But like on Sunday I ate a lot of tacos. And I ate a Choco Taco for dessert too."
06:07;06:14;"And I was throwing down spicy margs at the barbecue. And then I stayed in the hot tub too long."
06:14;06:24;"I was cooked. You crashed out hard at like 645. Yeah when I got out of the hot tub I felt"
06:24;06:29;"incredibly nauseous. I really could like visualize the spicy marg and the Choco Taco and the real"
06:29;06:36;"tacos. Oh and the real quesadillas just getting like boiled in my stomach. Yeah so whatever."
06:36;06:41;"I'm basically I'm trying to say we worked hard. We played hard. It was a big weekend. And then"
06:41;06:45;"I'm driving back and I had this real sense of like that's all it should be. You know it's like when"
06:45;06:50;"you're a kid and you're in a school play. They rehearse for like four months. Then they do two"
06:50;06:57;"performances. And it's like really just like you know or maybe they do three. Yeah. A Sunday matinee."
06:57;07:02;"But you know like it's like this giant thing that the kids do. Working their asses off like learning"
07:02;07:08;"their lines and like holy this is such a big deal. Then you perform it three times by Sunday evening."
07:08;07:12;"Parents are there. Yeah parents are there. Everybody comes out. The community comes out."
07:12;07:18;"Saturday. Sunday night you crush some Coca-Cola from a plastic two liter and some pizza. Pasta"
07:18;07:23;"dinner. Maybe a pasta dinner. And you're like wow we really did this. And you're like but it's only"
07:23;07:27;"one weekend. And I don't know I felt like that a little bit. Like that'd be hilarious. It's just"
07:27;07:33;"like you work on an album for years and it's all building up to one weekend of shows. Two shows in"
07:33;07:38;"Ojai. Just two shows in Ojai. Tequila and coffee. I almost had this feeling and it was like funny"
07:38;07:43;"because we didn't really even play any new stuff. So it's not like we even presented any of the new"
07:43;07:48;"music to the fans. But I did have this feeling of just like kind of rolling back to L.A. just kind"
07:48;07:53;"of like had that feeling like yeah you know maybe I'll just take a few days off to chill and start"
07:53;08:00;"thinking about the next record."
08:01;08:11;"What's Texas bound? We stopped over in Santa Fe. That day in the pool. Just about halfway."
08:11;08:15;"Hey you know it was the hottest part of the day."
08:15;08:26;"And I took the horse up to the stall. Went to the bar room. Ordered drinks for all."
08:27;08:34;"Three days in the saddle. You know my body hurt. It'd been summer. I took off my shirt."
08:34;08:38;"And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt."
08:38;08:49;"Went to Texas Cowboys. There's all around. We were liquor and money. They loaded down."
08:50;08:58;"So soon after payday. No it seemed a shame. He starts playing the game."
09:20;09:23;"How was Santa Ana? Oh yeah then I forgot that we were playing Santa Ana."
09:23;09:29;"We played the two shows at the observatory in Santa Ana. What's that? Like is that a"
09:29;09:35;"rock club or what is it? Yeah it's a it's an 1100 cap rock club. Great sight lines."
09:35;09:40;"What does that mean exactly? It's not like some weird old theater where everybody is just like"
09:40;09:46;"standing in in a row. This place I don't know how long this has been open like five years. This place"
09:46;09:52;"was clearly designed for fan enjoyment. So it's kind of like a wide club and there's tiers. Oh"
09:52;09:56;"cool. So there's kind of not a bad place to stand in the house. I mean it's not like I've ever seen"
09:56;10:00;"a show there but my impression was there wasn't a bad place to stand in the house. It was definitely"
10:00;10:04;"different energy than the Ohio shows. I think I talked about it on stage a little bit because"
10:04;10:10;"Ohio was like crunchy hippy dippy father's day weekend. A lot of t-shirt sales going off the"
10:10;10:15;"chain. Oh yeah the t-shirt sales in Ohio were just unbelievable. Your guys shirts blew out. Oh yeah"
10:15;10:20;"sold them out first day. The father yeah first day. I had people just irate with me on the internet."
10:20;10:27;"Really? Just like do not post t-shirts online that you will not be selling on the internet. Oh and"
10:27;10:31;"I was like I got nothing for that. Guys it's 2018 there's gonna be a lot of interplay between the"
10:31;10:36;"internet and IRL. Yep. That's just how it is. Yeah and then the vampire weekend father's day shirts"
10:36;10:43;"blew out. Shout out to uh bring out your dead. Oh yeah. His shirts blew out very soft too. Yeah I"
10:43;10:49;"got in trouble with even some uh people close to me in my life because everybody was like yo can I"
10:49;10:53;"get some of those shirts and I was like yeah and I was like you know what on Sunday I'll grab some"
10:53;10:57;"then I get there on Sunday and I'm like yo can I get like five of these all gone. Yeah. I'm gonna"
10:57;11:02;"do a little reprint. It gets stressful with the shirts because it's limited run people are just"
11:02;11:07;"like right like I need one. Like yeah well but hey it's a good problem to have. Yeah. It's better"
11:07;11:14;"than the stress of uh ripping back down to LA with 200 unsold vampire weekend Richard pictures"
11:14;11:20;"June 16th 17th 2018 Ohio shirts. Taking up all sorts of room in the garage."
11:20;11:28;"Smash got like two years from now. Although are these the shirts from that Ohio weekend still here?"
11:28;11:34;"Oh man. I think we're gonna start doing shirts for every show. Oh I love it. Like we're playing"
11:34;11:39;"August 9th at the Old Town Pub. SoCal people mark your calendars. It's the anniversary of"
11:39;11:45;"Jerry Garcia's death. Oh yeah. So we're playing a big two set night there August 9th but we're"
11:45;11:50;"gonna do shirts for that. Oh sick. Yeah we did we did a special Santa Ana shirt too. Oh really?"
11:50;11:55;"I don't know if it blew out though. That's a deep shirt. We just did another long sleeve but anyway"
11:55;12:01;"yeah the observatory is a great club in Santa Ana. Um I think I've said things to this effect"
12:01;12:06;"on the show before but sometimes people think like you know when we post certain things on"
12:06;12:11;"Instagram we're being cryptic or mysterious or yeah or even like with the shows that there's"
12:11;12:15;"like you know sometimes there's no rhyme or reason it's just like somebody asked me a month ago hey"
12:15;12:20;"after the Ohio shows you want to do a couple more get everybody like continue to play yeah and you"
12:20;12:23;"know of course in my head a month ago I'm like yeah maybe even by then we'll be dropping new"
12:23;12:27;"songs in the set but whatever people seem chill but anyway yeah the energy was super different"
12:27;12:34;"because I don't know if it's like part of Orange County culture but people there like bring real"
12:34;12:38;"enthusiasm because you know like a lot of times people will generalize and say like well LA New"
12:38;12:44;"York shows the crowd's a little more arms crossed yeah not that psyched but then you know if you go"
12:44;12:49;"play show in Jersey or Orange County or just you know a little bit away from the big city"
12:49;12:54;"right people know how to have a good time and I kind of forgot that like there was significant"
12:54;12:59;"amounts of crowd surfing in Santa Ana sick which of course like you know Sunday morning in Ohio"
12:59;13:06;"you're not gonna get any of that especially after the a dead cover band opens it up in a real chill"
13:06;13:12;"way yeah that was chill vibes this was a little more intense a lot of like really loud singing"
13:12;13:17;"which was cool like people shouting the songs at the top of their lungs yeah nice yeah and just"
13:17;13:24;"really have some moshing moshing yeah to what songs cousin um there was like sometimes there'd"
13:24;13:30;"be like a light mosh to a not very moshy type song but yeah definitely the higher energy ones"
13:30;13:34;"you would see like real movement dude the pit during white sky yeah there was like yeah there"
13:34;13:39;"was a little bit like that have you had pits before yeah it was it made me think back because"
13:39;13:45;"maybe also because like I've been haven't done it in years and you know I'm older so I'm just more"
13:45;13:50;"chill now I then I kind of remembered I was like oh yeah in certain places we used to play it was"
13:50;13:56;"like straight up crazy pits wow I remember the UK that would happen a lot because they get down there"
13:56;14:03;"over there no but I remember one time it was like there was like a pit during horchata or some like"
14:03;14:09;"song that wasn't like one of the punky ones people just want to rage yeah but I respect that it's"
14:09;14:12;"tight yeah well then you always get a little stressed out because you know you're watching"
14:12;14:17;"the whole thing unfold in a way that the audience can't see yeah so and there was like some very"
14:17;14:23;"athletic crowd surfing there's like this uh dude and uh the second Santana show who wasn't even"
14:23;14:28;"just crowd surfing at a certain point his bros were like holding up his feet and legs and he was"
14:28;14:34;"crowd standing you know what I mean wow almost like some uh cheerleading but then there's also"
14:34;14:38;"just like you know sometimes you see like a big dude crowd surfing and the whole especially there"
14:38;14:44;"the whole club can see it so you're kind of like hell yeah you shout him out but then you look and"
14:44;14:48;"you're like you know see his like foot just missed somebody's head and you're just like imagining"
14:48;14:55;"some scenario where you're like oh hell yeah check it out crowd surfing bro and the next thing you"
14:55;14:59;"know like some you know smaller person is being like carried out by the bouncer everybody's like"
14:59;15:04;"dead quiet I'm just like I'm sorry I wasn't encouraging it I was just you know trying to"
15:04;15:10;"shout out I like the enthusiasm but yeah ratcheting it down a couple notches guys"

17:54;17:59;"iHob and things like that okay that was a major event man I saw someone tweeted at you that the"
17:59;18:05;"data seems to imply that they did not get more foot traffic right iHob that was gratifying the"
18:05;18:10;"thing that I don't like about it though is like you know everybody's gonna gang up on iHob but"
18:10;18:14;"they're gonna let all these other suckers get a pass you know what I mean everybody likes to see"
18:14;18:19;"a loser but sometimes you got to look around and be like you know what you're all losers all you"
18:19;18:24;"fast food social media places and by the way I haven't forgotten about Punisher Burgers"
18:24;18:28;"been accused I thought you just creeping into Punisher Burger character I'm still thinking"
18:28;18:34;"about it I still want to do it Frank Castle I make my own burgers and I do my own social media"
18:34;18:41;"I I still like that idea this is one TC idea that's not going to get lost in the sands of"
18:41;18:46;"time but anyway we'll get into all that later let's get Katie on the phone now let's go into"

20:26;20:36;"here's my recollection I lived one floor below Katie and we started playing music together pretty"
20:36;20:41;"shortly after meeting I would say within like a month or two and I remember our first like real"
20:41;20:47;"friend road trip was to Eugene Oregon and I want to say October November 95 to see Pavement play"
20:47;20:54;"yeah wowie zowie tour oh wow that's some classic that's some classic college stuff is like trying"
20:54;20:58;"to figure out who your friends are totally like you guys known each other for a month and just"
20:58;21:04;"being like uh you want to see pavement and Eugene yeah yeah figuring out that we like the same band"
21:04;21:11;"it's important well Lewis and Clark at that time though was a real hippie school yeah I think it's"
21:11;21:18;"a little more hip now but totally back then it was like hardcore hacky sack campus dogs"
21:20;21:26;"fish right fish was like the predominant aesthetic and so if you kind of sniffed out someone else"
21:26;21:32;"that was into like other you know whatever pavement that kind of stuff that was a big deal"
21:32;21:38;"is that fair yeah totally fair um I got one more addition to to your story I mean there's I'm sure"
21:38;21:45;"there's more but so I was roomed with our friend Mariana Richie and we used to we were kind of"
21:45;21:51;"becoming friends quickly as well and we would we were in I can't remember if we were in the same"
21:51;21:56;"Spanish class together or something whatever the point is I had my acoustic guitar with me"
21:56;22:03;"she had her banjo with her and we used to just make up songs in our dorm room and um sing so"
22:03;22:09;"loud and just sing in harmony and sing these songs in Spanish I remember this yeah and so I remember"
22:09;22:16;"that one of our connections was that you were into the music that you could hear coming out of our"
22:16;22:23;"I loved it Jake just yeah walking down the hallway just do like a quick knock on the door"
22:23;22:30;"just like yeah hey sounds pretty good sounds pretty good my name is Jake Longstreet I'm a"
22:30;22:37;"freshman from Connecticut so formal oh I know yeah oh god that reminds me I don't know if I"
22:37;22:42;"ever told this story on time crisis but I remember the first week of me being at college and I didn't"
22:42;22:50;"know anybody and I was pretty like a little tiny bit panicked because I'd gone to some like"
22:50;22:55;"students weekend at Brown when I was a senior in high school and the guy who was hosting me"
22:55;23:01;"was kind of like not that into his experience at Brown so far and I just remember you know trying"
23:01;23:05;"to do whatever you're in these weird situations where you're kind of like I guess I'm supposed"
23:05;23:10;"to ask questions I was like um do you have any advice for incoming freshmen and the guy and the"
23:10;23:16;"guy got dead-ass serious and said my advice make sure you make friends in the first week I messed"
23:16;23:23;"up man I didn't lock it down first semester and by spring semester I was floundering it's not fun"
23:23;23:28;"and I was like oh my god oh my god so anyway I took that with me so my my friend my first week"
23:29;23:37;"in college I do remember actually walking down a hallway and hearing some dude blasting um"
23:37;23:43;"kid a by Radiohead and then I was like every fiber in my being did not want to do it but"
23:43;23:49;"I like another voice in my head was just like this is how it gets done in adulthood and I just kind"
23:49;23:55;"of walked in and be like oh you like Radiohead I'm like I'm pretty sure I never talked to that"
23:55;24:01;"person again had like an awkward 15 minute like dorm room hang and so anyway I'm pretty cool I'm"
24:01;24:03;"glad it worked out for you guys"
24:09;24:14;"'Cause around and 'round we'll go until we stop."
24:14;24:21;"So I can't get around the way I feel when you're around."
24:21;24:26;"'Cause around and 'round we'll go until we stop."
24:26;24:34;"But you are right and I am wrong, and so we never get along."
24:34;24:40;"And so we go around and 'round again."
24:40;24:42;"Time Crisis"
24:42;24:45;"Yeah, and then we started playing music and started a few bands."
24:45;24:46;"Yep."
24:46;24:48;"And then what year did Dear Nora start? '97?"
24:48;24:54;"No, dude, it wasn't until after... it was like pretty much right after we graduated."
24:54;24:58;"I think senior year, Richie and I just started recording all those"
24:58;25:01;"songs in the Lewis and Clark basement."
25:01;25:01;"Right."
25:01;25:03;"Like the music, the music rooms and the drum rooms."
25:04;25:09;"And then those would go on to be called Dear Nora recordings, but we didn't..."
25:09;25:09;"Right."
25:09;25:13;"I think we started playing Dear Nora live shows."
25:13;25:16;"I'm pretty sure... I want to say fall... wait, when did we graduate?"
25:16;25:18;"Yeah, fall '99. So it was the fall after we graduated."
25:18;25:19;"Oh, wow. Okay."
25:19;25:21;"Yeah."
25:21;25:27;"But some of those songs were already iconic in my imagination and in our friend group."
25:27;25:29;"Right. A couple of the songs have been around."
25:29;25:30;"You knew the early stuff."
25:30;25:32;"Oh, wow. So you guys started in '99."
25:32;25:34;"That means Dear Nora spans three decades."
25:34;25:35;"Oh my God, it's true."
25:35;25:39;"It's always funny when people put it like it's like clearly not even 20 years yet,"
25:39;25:42;"but just because you edged out, spanning three decades."
25:42;25:45;"The 90s, the aughts and the teens."
25:45;25:46;"Dear Nora."
25:46;25:53;"Yeah. Well, it's funny that you bring that up because I now privy to the fact that I have"
25:53;26:00;"these fans that are very much younger than me and they make an assumption, which I think,"
26:00;26:05;"like I understand where it comes from, but they like talk to me about what the 90s were like."
26:05;26:10;"And I'm like, yeah, I mean, most of what Dear Nora did wasn't in the 90s."
26:10;26:12;"Of course, we were like, lived the 90s."
26:12;26:14;"We remember it. We went to pavement shows in the 90s."
26:14;26:15;"But like, I don't know."
26:15;26:20;"I wasn't really like part of like that mid 90s, early 90s Riot Grrrl scene or anything."
26:20;26:23;"Right. Just by virtue of the fact that the band started in the 90s,"
26:23;26:29;"it kind of drags you into a decade that you were only performing live in for a few months of."
26:29;26:34;"Yeah, I think they picture me being more even more of an elder than I already am."
26:34;26:39;"I was just asking Jake because I hoped it wasn't derogatory because some people have"
26:39;26:43;"mixed feelings about it. But is it fair to describe Dear Nora as indie?"
26:43;26:47;"Because over those three decades, the word has changed quite a bit,"
26:47;26:50;"you know, in the way how people describe music, how people feel about it."
26:50;26:54;"Back in 99, would you guys have called yourself an"
26:54;26:59;"indie band or was there even any reason to describe yourselves?"
26:59;27:05;"I guess gut reaction is like what I associate with that term and the way it's used is like"
27:05;27:09;"independent label, which is what we were clearly on."
27:09;27:14;"When people called us indie pop, I was like, I don't know what that is, but all right, fine."
27:14;27:18;"I'm sure it was just like the same when like people started telling the guys in Pearl Jam"
27:18;27:24;"and Alice in Chains that they were grunge. Yeah, and they were like, OK, if you say so."
27:24;27:25;"Right."
27:25;27:28;"I don't remember us ever being like, oh, yeah, we're an indie rock band."
27:28;27:34;"No, that just wasn't even really on my radar. I like I came to college from rural Arizona."
27:34;27:40;"I listened to whatever, quote unquote, college rock or, you know, some of the"
27:40;27:44;"bigger independent labels, if they were even called that back then."
27:44;27:48;"But yeah, I just like mostly we were just trying to like play songs like"
27:48;27:50;"Pavement and Weezer and stuff."
27:50;27:56;"As we referred to your band before we called you as a was that seminal indie band or what"
27:56;27:58;"was the term you used? Renown?"
27:58;28:02;"Seminal, renowned, classic, something of that nature."
28:02;28:03;"Oh, thank you so much."
28:04;28:06;"Thank you."
28:08;28:12;"Dusty Coat, Dusty Coat, Dusty Coat, Dusty Coat"
28:12;28:16;"Did you notice ancient desert, did you?"
28:16;28:18;"Hmm"
28:18;28:26;"It's enough to wipe you off a juniper and clove"
28:26;28:34;"Deserted is the word for all this wonderful nothing"
28:36;28:42;"Antidote for mindlessness"
28:42;28:50;"Antidote for mindlessness"
28:50;28:54;"Antidote for mindlessness"
28:54;29:02;"I noticed like more and more that Dear Nora, like you were saying about younger fans coming up to you and asking you about the 90s, but it's definitely a thing."
29:02;29:08;"It's been in the air for the past couple of years. More and more young bands shouting out Dear Nora."
29:08;29:10;"Yeah."
29:10;29:12;"Like definitely the work has cast a long shadow."
29:12;29:26;"Yeah, I mean, it kind of came as a surprise to me. I mean, I started moving on to other things in my life. I was still writing songs, but I guess it's just sort of as streaming
platforms became more commonplace."
29:26;29:34;"More people started hearing it and not just hearing like one or two songs on YouTube or whatever, but like going hella deep."
29:34;29:40;"And like just knowing like obscure, weird shit I wrote when I was like 20."
29:40;29:48;"Right. That's sick. That's like the story you want to hear about the more interconnected streaming universe, which you almost never hear."
29:48;29:56;"You know, like you think like, wow, everybody has access to everything. People will be kind of rediscovering bands on independent labels from that era."
29:56;30:00;"You just don't hear too many stories. There's something like I think pretty like unique about it."
30:00;30:02;"Cream rises to the top."
30:02;30:03;"That's right."
30:03;30:06;"I mean, it's totally true. Like I said, I was totally surprised."
30:06;30:19;"I heard via our friend who I mentioned, Richie, via Michael Azarad. Michael Azarad emailed Richie and was like, hey, there's a band that has a song called Dear Nora."
30:19;30:24;"And he's like, they're really good. You should check them out. And it was Girlpool."
30:24;30:26;"I was like, what? I was like, what?"
30:26;30:29;"So, you know, just like just hearing that shit."
30:29;30:31;"Let me talk to my lawyer."
30:31;30:33;"Yeah."
30:33;30:35;"Cease and desist."
30:35;30:39;"At first I was irate. Then once I calmed down, I thought, OK, that's pretty cool."
30:39;30:46;"Their song, Dear Nora, is a truly loving tribute to the aesthetic of those early records."
30:46;30:47;"I love that."
30:47;30:49;"It sounds like mountain rock or something to me."
30:49;30:51;"It's a beautiful song."
30:51;30:52;"It really is."
30:52;30:58;"Yeah. And to like take it a step further, when I finally met those two, who I absolutely adore, they're incredible."
30:58;31:08;"I got to see them play live and I got like fully choked up at their show because I clearly they have many quote unquote influences."
31:08;31:12;"Like, of course, it's not me. It's like there's a lot of other people, too."
31:12;31:19;"But something about just hearing them play stripped down with like bass and guitar and just two vocals in harmony."
31:19;31:22;"I was like, damn, this is amazing."
31:22;31:28;"Like, even if we only contributed a small amount to what they're doing, like this is so tight."
31:28;31:30;"I feel inspired."
31:30;31:34;"Yeah, I saw them at the Echo a year or two ago and I loved it."
31:34;31:35;"Yeah, rad."
31:35;31:38;"It really did bring me back to that dorm room, Fall '95."
31:38;31:45;"If they'd been singing in Spanish, you would have had a full, fully disappeared into your memories."
31:45;31:46;"Full meltdown."
31:46;31:47;"Yeah."
31:47;31:53;"Dear Nora, there's a lot that's changed this year."
31:53;31:59;"I'm still thinking about swimming in Seattle."
31:59;32:05;"And when I got out, I wasn't even cold."
32:05;32:11;"My toes sunk in the squishy ground below."
32:36;32:42;"In SF, we were driving over bridges."
32:42;32:48;"We were singing to a herded through the grapevine."
32:48;32:51;"Cleo was tired."
32:51;32:55;"Harmony was hyper."
32:55;33:00;"We switched driving in the middle of the highway."
33:08;33:14;"So you mentioned how there was a while where you kind of took a break from using the Dear Nora name."
33:14;33:17;"You were still making music, writing songs, releasing music in that time."
33:17;33:21;"What was the impetus to bring back the OG vehicle?"
33:21;33:25;"I think that I just had enough separation from it."
33:25;33:33;"I don't know. I just like -- towards the end of my 20s, early 30s, I was like, okay, that's clearly a project that belongs in my 20s."
33:33;33:38;"It's like I'm not finding the things I used to find fun quite as fun anymore."
33:38;33:45;"It feels more like a struggle, like some of that dumb, am I supposed to be turning into an adult kind of bull that comes up."
33:45;33:48;"And so I just was like, let's just leave that band name behind."
33:48;33:51;"Let's leave it with the like terrible 20s."
33:51;33:58;"I think just enough time passed where it didn't trigger like bad feelings in the gut anymore."
33:58;34:07;"It was more like I had enough separation to not just like cringe at every single thing I recorded."
34:07;34:11;"I mean, I still cringe at 75% of it, but --"
34:11;34:13;"Yeah, I think that's just so many artists."
34:13;34:16;"Yeah, you need some perspective."
34:16;34:18;"For sure. And the separation did me right."
34:18;34:21;"I took almost 10 years away from it."
34:21;34:28;"Just that name, for whatever that means, whatever the reason, something about the name was I just needed to take a break from it,"
34:28;34:31;"whatever that means to other people."
34:31;34:35;"But after a while, it was just a game of like, it doesn't matter anymore."
34:35;34:37;"Most people know that name."
34:37;34:39;"I'm going to make new music."
34:39;34:40;"Let's just use that name."
34:40;34:45;"Especially because people were starting to use that name and reference that name more often."
34:45;34:48;"I'm like, it doesn't matter anymore."
34:48;34:51;"Let's just reach the most people."
34:51;34:58;"Yeah, definitely a lot of separation and letting go to just get back into that name and not worrying about it so much."

36:53;36:58;"I kept it in sort of chronological order because it, I wanted the listener of the"
36:58;37:03;"playlist to kind of go on this journey with you from the sort of very sunny,"
37:03;37:06;"optimistic kind of power pop early stuff."
37:06;37:11;"And then this sort of organic change gradually happens over the years where"

37:15;37:18;"And it kind of ends with you going like, ""Smells like rain."""
37:18;37:23;"And it's a, it's a hell of a journey."

37:24;37:27;"You just did a tour, right, of your new record?"

37:49;37:50;"How was the tour?"
37:50;37:52;"The tour was really fun."
37:52;37:55;"And the shows, like, we didn't have a dud out of all the shows."
37:55;38:00;"Like, certainly some more were my favorites, but it's honestly just like"
38:00;38:01;"kind of fun."

40:52;41:02;"You know, in light of last week's conversation, or last episode's conversation, we were talking"
41:02;41:08;"about how here on Time Crisis, we're getting kind of fed up with the cutesy social media"
41:08;41:12;"personalities of what should be faceless corporations."
41:12;41:16;"You know, maybe that's the problem, is that for a long time people would always be railing"

41:22;41:26;"And then of course, because this is America, rather than dismantle the faceless corporations,"

41:29;41:30;"No more faceless corporations."
41:30;41:34;"We're going to put a face and a personality on every corporation."""
41:34;41:35;"A little window dressing."
41:35;41:36;"Yeah."
41:36;41:38;"Well, you can't call them faceless anymore."
41:38;41:41;"They have an ironic personality now."
41:41;41:43;"You certainly can't call them voiceless."
41:43;41:50;"I guess the thing is, we all live with a lot of daily brutality in America."
41:50;41:54;"And that's why last episode we were talking about this semi-fawning New York Times piece"

41:58;42:00;"And they couldn't even report dispassionate."
42:00;42:04;"They had to kind of be like, ""Oh my God, it was a great marketing idea."""
42:04;42:09;"And they called it a success, and there wasn't even data to suggest it was a success yet."
42:09;42:14;"And now that we have a little data to suggest that it wasn't a success in terms of getting"
42:14;42:20;"butts in the restaurant spending money, I feel like the Times owes us an apology and"
42:20;42:21;"retraction."
42:21;42:26;"Yo, we should write a letter to the New York Times about a three-week-old article."
42:26;42:27;"We take issue."
42:27;42:29;"The June 2nd article."
42:29;42:34;"It's one thing when there's just kind of some annoying marketing shit out there in the atmosphere."
42:34;42:38;"But what's really annoying is that when you see people just loving it."
42:38;42:44;"And I came across this article that annoyed me and I had to share with the Crisis Crew."
42:44;42:46;"This is on a website called Board Panda."
42:46;42:50;"I saw that and I was like, ""How does Ezra end up on these websites?"""
42:50;42:58;"I ended up on Board Panda because I read an article about a French photographer who did"
42:58;43:01;"a book about pagan costumes of Europe."
43:01;43:04;"And I'll show it to you because it's unbelievable."
43:04;43:09;"And I think Board Panda is like, I don't know how legit of a site it is."
43:09;43:12;"Clearly on like some Buzzfeed type thing, they're good at getting people to like stay"
43:12;43:14;"on and just keep clicking."
43:14;43:19;"I don't know how much original stuff they do, how much editorial oversight there is"
43:19;43:20;"over at Board Panda."
43:20;43:24;"But I saw this headline as I was looking at the pagan costumes of Europe and I couldn't"
43:24;43:26;"resist a click."
43:26;43:27;"So they got me."
43:27;43:28;"They got you."
43:28;43:29;"They got me."
43:29;43:30;"This is the headline."
43:30;43:35;"""At Walmart, he likes to steal from their stores and their response is so good, people"
43:35;43:37;"say they beat Wendy's."""
43:37;43:38;"So everything about-"
43:38;43:39;"That's TaylorMade for us."
43:39;43:40;"Yeah."
43:40;43:42;"And everything about that, I was just already like so annoyed."
43:42;43:50;"This Board Panda, now the New York Times can buy into I was marketing campaign, but I expect"
43:50;43:52;"more from Board Panda."
43:52;43:56;"And it's so funny because it like kind of presupposes that we live in a world where"
43:56;44:04;"Wendy's already is the gold standard for a savage social media account."
44:04;44:09;"And so literally the headline, ""Oh man, Walmart roasted a guy so good, some people say they"
44:09;44:13;"may even be as good as Wendy's, if not better."""
44:13;44:14;"And this is the opening sentence."
44:14;44:20;"""We all know Wendy's is really savage on social media, but it seems there's another company"
44:20;44:23;"that's equally badass calling Walmart badass."""
44:23;44:29;"See, this is what these people dream about, that by having Wendy's or Walmart do something"
44:29;44:34;"savage on social media, that one day people will be like, ""You know, say what you will"
44:34;44:36;"about their labor practices."
44:36;44:38;"Walmart's pretty badass."""
44:38;44:39;"They are funny."
44:39;44:40;"They're funny."
44:40;44:46;"Say what you will about what they do to the economies of small towns, but they are funny."
44:46;44:49;"And honestly, if you're going to be real savage on Twitter, you're going to be a little bit"
44:49;44:53;"savage in business practices too, and that's okay."
44:53;44:55;"So anyway, Walmart."
44:55;44:57;"Walmart is equally badass."
44:57;45:03;"Recently Twitter user @merc361 challenged the retailer to a word fight on the internet"
45:03;45:04;"and it didn't back down."
45:04;45:05;"Word fight."
45:05;45:10;"Not intimidated by an insult that has been liked over 80K times, Walmart answered to"
45:10;45:12;"it in the best possible way."
45:12;45:18;"American multinational retail corporation one, random internet user zero."
45:18;45:19;"That about sums it up."
45:19;45:20;"That's, yeah."
45:20;45:25;"Gigantic, brutal corporation one, human being zero."
45:25;45:26;"Savage."
45:26;45:28;"Copy that."
45:28;45:30;"Continue scrolling to read their hilarious exchange."
45:30;45:31;"Well, I'm just going to read it."
45:31;45:33;"You guys don't have to scroll."
45:33;45:34;"Pretend you're scrolling at home."
45:34;45:37;"And there's like a big picture of this random dude, merc361."
45:37;45:39;"That sucks that his photo went out."
45:39;45:42;"I guess he semi brought it upon himself."
45:42;45:43;"That's his user profile."
45:43;45:47;"And he wrote, ""I like going to Walmart for fun."""
45:47;45:48;"And then Walmart tweeted at him."
45:48;45:49;"A thousand likes on that."
45:49;45:54;"Well, I think that's probably back, back dating on it."
45:54;45:55;"And then Walmart tweeted at him."
45:55;45:56;"It's the small things, merc."
45:56;45:58;"What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"
45:58;46:01;"First of all, they're already setting him up to say some funny shit."
46:01;46:02;"Yeah."
46:02;46:03;"What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"
46:03;46:04;"So they set him up."
46:04;46:07;"I like going to Walmart for fun and they tweeted him."
46:07;46:09;"What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"
46:09;46:14;"And then he writes back, ""Steal."""
46:14;46:15;"Which is fair."
46:15;46:16;"They set him up."
46:16;46:18;"They set him up for it."
46:18;46:20;"300,000 likes on that."
46:20;46:23;"Got 81K people talking about it."
46:23;46:26;"That's not getting one more customer in the store, by the way."
46:26;46:27;"No."
46:27;46:28;"This is just all noise."
46:28;46:33;"So he tweets that at 5.39 PM, June 20th, 2018."
46:33;46:44;"The next, in the middle of the night, 2.38 AM, nine hours later, under cover of night,"
46:44;46:47;"Walmart gets back on the keyboard."
46:47;46:49;"They needed nine hours to think about how to respond to that."
46:49;46:51;"They had to consult with the higher ups."
46:51;46:52;"Yeah."
46:52;46:53;"I bet that's true."
46:53;46:54;"Can you imagine those chains?"
46:54;46:58;"We got an epic burn here, but running up the flagpole, make sure we get clearance on that."
46:58;47:00;"Wait, was the family owns Walmart, the Waltons?"
47:00;47:01;"Yeah."
47:01;47:02;"This could go all the way to Alice Walton."
47:02;47:03;"Alice is not available, dude."
47:03;47:04;"She's in Vail."
47:04;47:05;"She can't."
47:05;47:06;"The house manager is on the phone."
47:06;47:07;"""Ms. Walton has been asleep for three hours."""
47:07;47:14;"And she specifically said that she did not want to be disturbed."
47:14;47:15;"This is urgent."
47:16;47:17;"""I'm Mrs. Walton."""
47:17;47:18;"She's like, ""Hello?"
47:18;47:19;"What's the meaning of this?"""
47:19;47:25;"""Ms. Walton, this is the team down at Walmart Social Media."
47:25;47:28;"We got burned pretty bad by a guy named Merc361."
47:28;47:33;"How do we have permission to use lethally savage force?"""
47:33;47:38;"Like, ""And him."""
47:38;47:41;"I'm so curious about the nine hours in between."
47:41;47:44;"The email chains, the frantic phone calls."
47:44;47:45;"Yeah."
47:45;47:49;"I'm sure that it was a big deal, especially Walmart is supposedly family friendly or something."
47:49;47:51;"Kind of like middle America family friendly."
47:51;47:52;"So they're like Wendy's."
47:52;47:54;"Wendy's has already established themselves."
47:54;47:55;"They're punk rock."
47:55;47:57;"They tell people to go fuck themselves."
47:57;47:59;"But Walmart, they're probably right on the line."
47:59;48:02;"They're just like, ""Man, we've been burned pretty bad."""
48:02;48:04;"It's a little bit like the Drake Pusha T beef."
48:04;48:10;"Apparently, I heard that Drake had a comeback to Pusha T that was so savage, it would have"
48:10;48:15;"destroyed Kanye's career, Pusha T's career, and long-term Drake's career."
48:15;48:16;"What?"
48:16;48:17;"A true nuclear option."
48:17;48:18;"What?"
48:18;48:19;"That's what people say."
48:19;48:20;"How could that possibly be?"
48:20;48:21;"I thought about it."
48:21;48:22;"I have my theories."
48:22;48:26;"I don't want to get into it because that's none of my business."
48:26;48:30;"I'm just saying, if there was something so crazy that he had on Kanye, and that apparently"
48:30;48:33;"Kanye told Pusha T, ""You got to end this."""
48:33;48:40;"And then even Drake, when he beheld the awesome power of his savage information, similar to"
48:40;48:45;"... What's the guy that worked on the atomic bomb?"
48:45;48:46;"Oppenheimer."
48:46;48:47;"Oh, Oppenheimer."
48:47;48:50;"Yeah, it's- Oppenheimer looked and said, ""Now I am become"
48:50;48:53;"death, destroyer of worlds."""
48:53;48:59;"Drake looked at the savage information, which was basically an atomic bomb, and he felt,"
48:59;49:02;"he thought of that line, ""Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."""
49:02;49:04;"He's Thanos, basically."
49:04;49:09;"He knew, ""If I use this information, yes, I will destroy the enemy."
49:09;49:16;"But I'll create a void so crazy that I will be sucked into it too."""
49:16;49:18;"Mutually assured destruction."
49:18;49:20;"Yes, the Cold War."
49:20;49:25;"Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."
49:25;49:27;"The game's fucked up, those beats is banging."
49:27;49:30;"Your hooks did it, the lyric pinning."
49:30;49:32;"Equal to Trump winning."
49:32;49:35;"The bigger question is how the Russians did it."
49:35;49:37;"It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin."
49:37;49:40;"At the mercy of a game where the codes is missing."
49:40;49:43;"When the CEO's blinded by the glow, it's different."
49:43;49:46;"Believe in myself and the codes and Kendricks."
49:46;49:49;"Let the sock puppets play in they roles and gimmicks."
49:49;49:54;"Remember Will Smith won the first Grammy, and they ain't even recognize Hov and T.O."
49:54;49:55;"Annie."
49:55;49:59;"So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy, 'cause I'm posed to juggle these"
49:59;50:00;"flows and nose candy."
50:00;50:01;"Yeah."
50:01;50:04;"Ferrari my 40th blew the candles out."
50:04;50:07;"Tom Brady, I had to scramble out."
50:07;50:09;"Baby riding these waves, I pulled my sandals out."
50:09;50:12;"Had they lat in my Grammy, I went the Spanish route."
50:12;50:14;"Oh now it's okay to kill baby."
50:14;50:18;"Looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby."
50:18;50:21;"Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure."
50:21;50:24;"So Walmart was in a similar situation dealing with Merc 361."
50:24;50:25;"Right."
50:25;50:26;"He says."
50:26;50:28;"He says that he likes to steal from Walmart."
50:28;50:30;"That's his favorite thing to do."
50:30;50:31;"Nine hours go by."
50:32;50:33;"It's 2.40 in the morning."
50:33;50:35;"Alice Walton's on the horn."
50:35;50:38;"She gives the go ahead for them to go savage."
50:38;50:41;"Guys, go savage."
50:41;50:43;"Well played Merc."
50:43;50:47;"After further review of our store's video feed, we've decided to let you keep the rash"
50:47;50:49;"cream."
50:49;50:51;"Next time though, pay in full."
50:51;50:53;"Winky face emoji."
50:53;50:54;"Boom."
50:54;50:57;"Eat shit Merc."
50:57;50:58;"Yeah."
50:58;51:00;"It would be."
51:00;51:04;"So yeah, they're like, they're running all the numbers."
51:04;51:05;"What can we do here?"
51:05;51:06;"Do we tell him to go fuck himself?"
51:06;51:09;"Like, no, take the high road."
51:09;51:14;"We're going to say, yeah, okay, we know you stole, but you stole rash cream."
51:14;51:15;"Rash cream."
51:15;51:16;"You have a rash Merc."
51:16;51:17;"Yeah."
51:17;51:18;"I got poison Ivy."
51:18;51:19;"Big deal."
51:19;51:20;"So I got some cortisone cream."
51:20;51:22;"That's how, that's how he should have come back."
51:22;51:23;"It's funny cause it's Walmart."
51:23;51:29;"So they couldn't like a more savage company would have made it like an STD or something."
51:29;51:32;"Or like you got the ED medication, huh?"
51:32;51:33;"Right."
51:33;51:38;"It would be very problematic, but there, so this way, or if they just go like way hard,"
51:38;51:40;"like very un-PC stuff."
51:40;51:41;"Yeah."
51:41;51:45;"You got that a box of gay pornos, huh?"
51:45;51:46;"Right."
51:46;51:48;"Just like, wait, wait, we don't even carry that."
51:48;51:49;"Yeah."
51:49;51:54;"Just like, you know, there's at least some part of just Walmart going full homophobic."
51:54;51:56;"I mean, I'm actually, I'm curious."
51:56;51:57;"Does that happen yet?"
51:57;51:59;"Just like, Oh, overstepping."
51:59;52:03;"Well, yeah, like overstepping and just cause obviously we see, we see people do that all"
52:03;52:04;"the time."
52:04;52:08;"They think they're being funny and they say something awful, racist or homophobic."
52:08;52:11;"I wonder if that's ever going to happen with like a brand."
52:11;52:16;"No, but the joke is that it's all Ivy league grads running the social media accounts of"
52:16;52:17;"these corporations."
52:17;52:20;"They could still maybe do something by accident."
52:20;52:21;"Right."
52:21;52:22;"Wendy's did not know."
52:22;52:24;"Well, hence the nine hours they got to, they got a lawyer up."
52:24;52:25;"Right."
52:25;52:30;"Is there anything racist about telling Merck three 61 that he has a rash?"
52:30;52:31;"Is it homophobic?"
52:31;52:34;"Is it homophobic to tell Merck three 61 that he has a rash?"
52:34;52:35;"Is it Islamophobic?"
52:35;52:39;"Is it Islamophobic to tell Merck three 61 that he has a rash?"
52:39;52:40;"Yeah."
52:40;52:44;"Just imagine like the conversations and like, there's like 10 people on the Supreme council"
52:44;52:46;"of Walmart, nine are in favor."
52:46;52:50;"And one's like, I don't know guys, I think it's a little racist."
52:50;52:54;"God, that would be, I would love just to see one of these companies just like they deserve"
52:54;52:55;"to get like real roasted."
52:55;52:59;"Cause that's what the thing, all this, it's like this like fun and games, fake personality"
52:59;53:00;"stuff."
53:00;53:01;"Anyway."
53:01;53:06;"So Walmart took their nine hours and they came up with calling it rash cream."
53:06;53:09;"People applauding Walmart for such a savage answer."
53:09;53:10;"Yeah."
53:10;53:12;"To continue with the, Oh, there's like pages of this."
53:12;53:13;"Yeah."
53:13;53:14;"Wow."
53:14;53:18;"So these are some of the tweets that people said LMFAO, at least they have a sense of"
53:18;53:19;"humor."
53:19;53:20;"Gotta love Walmart."
53:20;53:27;"When you take a step back, how did we get to this place in our world where say what"
53:27;53:29;"you, it literally is a human being saying, say true about Walmart."
53:29;53:30;"They got a sense of humor."
53:30;53:33;"Walmart is funnier than Merck three 61."
53:33;53:34;"You gotta love them."
53:34;53:35;"Somebody else treated, wow."
53:35;53:37;"Walmart is more savage than Wendy's."
53:37;53:39;"And I didn't think that was even possible."
53:39;53:42;"Wendy's is the height of savagery."
53:42;53:45;"Some other ones, he's going to have to steal some burn cream."
53:45;53:46;"Now."
53:46;53:50;"I think the other person said, should have said, we'll let you keep the extra small condoms."
53:50;53:51;"LMA."
53:51;53:52;"Oh, okay."
53:52;53:53;"Yep."
53:53;53:54;"That, you know what?"
53:54;53:55;"That's also funny too."
53:55;53:59;"How like not an item that's sold extra small condoms."
53:59;54:01;"I've looked."
54:01;54:02;"Okay."
54:02;54:08;"Also, it's funny too, that like Walmart is like opening it up for like other people to"
54:08;54:10;"roast this guy too."
54:10;54:11;"Yeah."
54:11;54:14;"Like Walmart's like, Oh, we just made a joke about a rash."
54:14;54:17;"All that, uh, racist shit down in the bottom."
54:17;54:18;"That's on them."
54:18;54:21;"I can't say I was sad to see it."
54:21;54:26;"Just like at the end of the day, Walmart is engaging in this like larger conversation."
54:26;54:30;"Oh, Walmart, social media manager bringing the heat."
54:30;54:32;"They should do a collab with Wendy's."
54:32;54:34;"Oh, here's another one."
54:34;54:35;"Holy shit, man."
54:35;54:38;"I love it when corporations take the shit in full and swing it back."
54:38;54:39;"It's hilarious."
54:39;54:40;"Woo."
54:40;54:45;"Anyway, just like the whole tone of this article, just like boys, we didn't think anyone"
54:45;54:48;"could be as savage as Wendy's, but now I got Walmart and I, whatever, I guess people feel"
54:48;54:49;"that way."
54:49;54:52;"I'd like to follow up with Merc three 61 and see how he feels about the whole thing."
54:52;54:53;"We should have him call in."
54:53;54:56;"Hey, can we get Merc three 61 on the horn?"
54:56;54:57;"Maybe next time."
54:57;55:04;"Just talking about this two months later, maybe bored pandas secretly owned by Walmart"
55:04;55:05;"or like, Oh, that'd be hilarious."
55:05;55:07;"False flag Walmart operation."
55:07;55:08;"It's possible though."
55:08;55:09;"Walmart."
55:09;55:12;"I also remember last time we were looking at the YouTube comments for the Hardee's commercial."
55:12;55:13;"Oh yeah."
55:13;55:17;"And our friend was saying that she thought that a bunch of the comments might've been"
55:17;55:18;"from right."
55:18;55:19;"People who worked for the brand."
55:19;55:25;"So it's also hilarious to, to imagine that Walmart has like a troll farm basically, that"
55:25;55:29;"every time they tweet something, they might have a hundred accounts that they're also"
55:29;55:32;"running people just being like, Holy shit, that's so savage."
55:32;55:35;"Not only do you have great deals, you've earned this shit out of that piece of shit."
55:35;55:38;"Or dude, maybe Merc was false flag."
55:38;55:42;"He was, he was working for Walmart the whole time, dude."
55:42;55:44;"That's some Alex Jones stuff right there."
55:44;55:46;"They like, they planned the whole narrative."
55:46;55:47;"I've seen the documents."
55:47;55:48;"Yeah."
55:48;55:50;"Because that, you know, that's true."
55:50;55:54;"If you really want to win people over, nobody likes just a big corporation."
55:54;56:00;"That's, you know, destroying local economies, not giving people a health insurance."
56:00;56:05;"People only like you when you've been on the ropes once or twice."
56:05;56:07;"America loves like a, a comeback story."
56:07;56:09;"You know, it's like Donald Trump."
56:09;56:11;"That's why he's going to win in 2020."
56:11;56:12;"Oh no, don't say that."
56:12;56:16;"But it's like if people, if people had really, that's why I like a lot of, a lot of lefties"
56:16;56:17;"are pulling their hair out."
56:17;56:23;"Just being kind of like, how do you not see that this dude is the epitome of what nobody"
56:23;56:24;"likes."
56:24;56:25;"He's a rich guy."
56:25;56:28;"He got a million dollars from his dad."
56:28;56:29;"He pulls strings for himself."
56:29;56:30;"He's the swamp."
56:30;56:31;"How do people not see it?"
56:31;56:37;"And it's because he crafted his little wrestling esque narrative about him being the Avenger"
56:37;56:38;"and a man I've had it bad too."
56:38;56:41;"And Oh my God, I look at these people and boy, I built my own thing."
56:41;56:46;"I'm just like you people like somebody that they think has been up and down a little bit."
56:46;56:49;"So Walmart is like, we need to, we need to drop some savagery on people, but we need"
56:49;56:50;"to make it right."
56:50;56:53;"It needs to be, we need to be in the right."
56:53;56:55;"We need a heroic moment."
56:55;56:56;"We need to be aggrieved."
56:56;56:57;"Right."
56:57;56:59;"We were just trying to be sweet to Merc 361."
56:59;57:00;"Then he tells us he steals."
57:00;57:03;"Well, nobody likes a thief, dude."
57:03;57:05;"That's my call inside job from the get."
57:05;57:06;"Wow."
57:06;57:09;"But it was, but there was a picture of Merc 361."
57:09;57:10;"There's like a real thing."
57:10;57:12;"You see, they might've had to disappear."
57:12;57:13;"The original guy."
57:13;57:14;"They killed a dude."
57:14;57:17;"They killed a dude just for retweets."
57:17;57:18;"Worth it."
57:18;57:19;"Good Lord."
57:19;57:20;"Alice Walton cleared it."
57:20;57:23;"I'm tired of hearing that Wendy's is more savage than us."
57:23;57:53;"No mistake. No mistake. No mistake. No mistake. No mistake. No mistake. No mistake. No mistake."
57:53;57:54;"The top off."
57:54;57:55;"Let the sun come in."
57:55;57:56;"Whoa."
57:56;57:57;"For all my dogs that stay down."
57:57;57:58;"We up again."
57:58;57:59;"Oh, I got dirt on my name."
57:59;58:00;"I got white on my beer."
58:00;58:01;"I had dead on my books."
58:01;58:02;"It's been a shaky air."
58:02;58:03;"Dear."
58:03;58:04;"Let me make this clear."
58:04;58:17;"So all y'all see, I don't take advice from people that successful to me."
58:17;58:21;"Ain't no love loss, but the gloves off and we have been as today."
58:21;58:23;"Turn the club off."
58:23;58:24;"Had to tell the dogs."
58:24;58:25;"Turn the snubs off."
58:25;58:30;"Plus, they are already mad that the cubs lost."
58:30;58:31;"These two wrongs are right."
58:31;58:32;"You believe it or not."
58:32;58:36;"I was too grown in high school."
58:36;58:39;"The true soul of ice cube too close to snipe you."
58:39;58:40;"Truth told."
58:40;58:43;"I like you too bold to type you too rich to fight you."
58:43;58:45;"Calm down your nice skin!"
58:45;58:48;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
58:48;58:54;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
58:54;59:00;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
59:00;59:06;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
59:06;59:12;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
59:13;59:18;"Make no mistake, girl I still love you"
59:18;59:22;"On the lighter side, let's dig into the old mailbag. We get so many good emails."
59:22;59:26;"Can't get to all of them. We can't get to all of them. Some of them are very touching."
59:26;59:32;"We get some very touching ones and in fact, we got a sweet email recently from a guy named"
59:32;59:38;"Kevin Eskowitz and the subject was a very sweet chilly heat wedding. This is touching because"
59:38;59:42;"as time crisis starts really getting up there, we've been around for a minute,"
59:42;59:46;"there truly is a, you know, a crew. We've been going on three years."
59:46;59:50;"That's wild. I think we started August of 15. This is episode 71, man."
59:50;59:53;"Deep. So this is an email from Kevin."
59:53;59:56;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
59:56;01:00:01;"Greetings Ezra Jake and our fellow TC listeners. I wanted to share my TC love story. A little over"
01:00:01;01:00:07;"10 years ago at college in DC, I met the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. We started dating"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"a bit later and Vampire Weekend's debut served as a soundtrack to that beautiful college romance."
01:00:12;01:00:18;"2008, man. That was a good era. As things go, she went abroad and we took a break and life got in"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"the way. After graduation, she moved to New York and I went to LA. Classic. It's already a rom-com."
01:00:23;01:00:29;"After a few years of growing up in different cities, we reconnected from across the country."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"We fell back in love and decided to really go for it. A year later, she decided to take the leap and"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"move to LA for me, but she was an East Coast gal living that East Coast life and I knew it would"
01:00:38;01:00:42;"take some convincing for her to really come around to this place. Like many who have taken the same"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"journey, she hated the fact that she had to drive everywhere and it made her feel disconnected from"
01:00:46;01:00:51;"the city and its people. It's tough. I still mourn for the East Coast. Gotta get over there more."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Not me."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"You're never looking back."
01:00:54;01:00:58;"Nope. Don't mind driving either. I'd rather sit in traffic than on a subway."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Wow."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Straight up."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Jake's takes on time crisis."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"I mean, that makes me a bastard."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"It took some time for her to warm up, but nothing helped her to embrace this city"
01:01:10;01:01:15;"more than our Sundays driving around town and cleaning up the house alongside the crisis crew."
01:01:15;01:01:15;"Wow."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"There you did help convert somebody, Jake. We are that classic TC couple."
01:01:19;01:01:26;"I love that. Classic TC couple. Grabbing some fresh produce at the farmer's market,"
01:01:26;01:01:30;"stopping in at Home Depot and doing some laundry while learning about the tasteful"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"palate of the 70s and starbucking. We gotta get winter back on."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Let's check in with winter next episode."
01:01:37;01:01:41;"Two Sundays ago, we were lucky enough to catch the Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"show at the Livvy Bowl and got to drive back home with a brand new TC on."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"Well, that's full."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"That's a hell of a Sunday. That's a hell of a Father's Day."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"That's full integration."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Yeah."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Both bands."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"Yeah."
01:01:52;01:01:58;"Jake's Grateful Dead cover band, Vampire Weekend, and then another two hour radio program."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"If we ever do another..."
01:02:00;01:02:00;"We're dick."
01:02:01;01:02:05;"Another kind of like Richard Pictures, Vampire Weekend, weekend kind of thing."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"We have to."
01:02:06;01:02:11;"We could. I mean, I do have a vision for it. It was such a smashing success the first time that"
01:02:11;01:02:16;"we kind of start adding auxiliary events. We could do a live time crisis."
01:02:16;01:02:16;"Love it."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Seinfeld 2000 holds a high stakes poker match."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"T-shirt raffle."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Something."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"Yeah. Maybe Friday night. I'm trying to think."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Maybe it's three shows, dude."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"We could do."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Yeah. Friday, Saturday night and Sunday morning."
01:02:31;01:02:31;"Yeah."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"Back at the Libby Bowl, like next summer."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Maybe we get Alanis to come through."
01:02:36;01:02:36;"Now you're talking."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"Jamie Foxx, friend of the show."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Yeah, get Jamie on the horn."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"He's a great musician."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Oh, I'm aware."
01:02:43;01:02:47;"Who knows? He's a born performer. I've witnessed him, you know,"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"turn a dead party into something really exciting."
01:02:50;01:02:54;"I wonder if Jamie Foxx remembers our episode with him. I'm going to say no."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Yeah, it's hard to say."
01:02:56;01:02:59;"He's never thought about it since. Let me put it that way."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"If someone reminded him of like about three years ago,"
01:03:02;01:03:06;"you went to that little recording studio on Coanga or whatever it was."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"And the guy from Vampire Weekend was there."
01:03:09;01:03:09;"He might remember."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"He'd be like, oh, yeah."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Right. It's not like. Yeah."
01:03:13;01:03:13;"Yeah."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"He probably hasn't had reason to bring it up."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"I remember. I remember there was a warm"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"Modelo sitting in front of him and he cracked."
01:03:21;01:03:25;"He looked at it like he'd never seen a Modelo before and then cracked it."
01:03:25;01:03:31;"Took one sip and made the funniest face like this is the most disgusting thing, which is true."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"You can't blame him."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Room temperature Modelo is disgusting."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"And then you just like sat it down on the table, like far away from him."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"And you didn't go up to him later, say,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"Jamie, I couldn't help but notice you didn't enjoy the warm Modelo."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"I'm with you."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"On the temperature."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"On the temperature issue ever."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Can I offer you a nice cold one?"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Somehow that wasn't the vibe."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Get Dear Nora to come through."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"Jamie Foxx, Seinfeld 2000, Alain."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Who else have we had on the show?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"Dev, Dev Hines."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Oh, the guy that wrote the curb theme."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"The guy that wrote the Seinfeld theme."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Oh, T-Pain."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"Oh, T-Pain."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"That could be crazy."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Another weekend in Ojai."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"That'd be pretty tight."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"We gotta get Mayer on the show, dude."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Yeah, I bet we could."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"John Mayer's Instagram is hilarious."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"Do you follow him?"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"Yes."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Really?"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Hannah got me really into his Instagram."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"He's like legitimately funny."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"Even though you don't respect his lyricism?"
01:04:26;01:04:26;"I don't."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"I'm not a big fan of his music,"
01:04:28;01:04:32;"but I think he is like a very self-aware funny dude."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"He does seem self-aware."
01:04:33;01:04:33;"Yeah."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"Maybe I'll bless him with a follow."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Jake leaving comments."
01:04:36;01:04:40;"John, although your lyricism is still lacking."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"Tone is fairly solid."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"John, I gave your tone an eight,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"your lyricism a four,"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"but your Instagram humor a ten."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Keep rocking, buddy."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"What, John, what you lack..."
01:04:54;01:04:58;"John, what you lack in guitar lyricism,"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"you make up for in wry Instagram humor."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"So anyway, back to the email."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"That's a hell of a day."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"They caught that daytime vampire RP show,"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"drove back with some TC on."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"It was on that drive while tuning in,"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"we decided to send this email."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"By the time the next show airs,"
01:05:38;01:05:42;"we'll be married and on our way to a new life together"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"with hopefully multiple fridges in our future home."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"We're doing the damn thing out in Malibu this Saturday."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Wow."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Oh, wow."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"They're married now."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"After we say I do and I stomp on that glass,"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"a Jewish wedding,"
01:05:54;01:05:58;"M79 will play during the recessional."
01:05:58;01:05:58;"Nice."
01:05:58;01:06:02;"That's one of Jake's top..."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"Yep."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"That's a top 10 for me."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"That's top 10?"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"That may be my favorite on that first record."
01:06:08;01:06:08;"On the first one?"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"That and Kids Don't Stand a Chance."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Did you catch it live in Ojai?"
01:06:12;01:06:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"With that, we got that new clav intro."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"It's a little funkier."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Will wearing the bucket hat."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Old bucket hat."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Crushing it."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"It's gonna take a little time."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"While you're waiting like a factory line."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"I'll ride across the park."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Backseat on the 79."
01:06:59;01:07:03;"Wasted days you come to pass."
01:07:08;01:07:12;"So go, I know you would not stay."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"It wasn't true, but anyway."
01:07:16;01:07:21;"I'm gonna meet you, yellow cat."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"You walk up the stairs."
01:07:52;01:07:55;"See the French kids by the door."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"Up one more flight."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"See the boot on the second floor."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Cause a nation to rip the shark trap."
01:08:07;01:08:12;"So go, I know you would not stay."
01:08:12;01:08:16;"It wasn't true, but anyway."
01:08:16;01:08:20;"Racist dreams you should not hide."
01:08:45;01:08:49;"No excuse to be so careless."
01:08:49;01:08:53;"Dress yourself in bleeding mattress."
01:08:53;01:08:58;"Charm your way across the Kyber Pass."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"Stay awake to break the habit."
01:09:06;01:09:10;"Singing praise of Jackson Crowder."
01:09:10;01:09:14;"Watch your step along the archer."
01:09:48;01:09:53;"No excuse to be so careless."
01:09:53;01:09:57;"Dress yourself in bleeding mattress."
01:09:57;01:10:02;"Charm your way across the Kyber Pass."
01:10:05;01:10:10;"Stay awake to break the habit."
01:10:10;01:10:14;"Singing praise of Jackson Crowder."
01:10:14;01:10:18;"Watch your step along the archer."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Time Crisis."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"So they're gonna play M79 You're in the Recessional"
01:10:30;01:10:34;"and then go straight into my TC-inspired playlist for the cocktail hour."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Ooh, I wonder what that playlist is."
01:10:35;01:10:39;"I bet it, I bet they probably pull from your Tasteful 70s palette playlist."
01:10:39;01:10:43;"Speaking of, did you notice in Ojai during all of the..."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Oh, they played it."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Yeah, they were playing the Tasteful palette playlist."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Was that your call?"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"That was my call."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"Nice, dude."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"Because that's one of the things that I always forget about."
01:10:52;01:10:56;"I always have these like grand visions about what type of music to play in between shows"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"and then almost always it's like I'm stressed out and like warming up and somebody's like,"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"""Oh, do you know what you wanted to play?"""
01:11:00;01:11:01;"Right."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"And so then I was like, ""Oh, Jake's Tasteful palette playlist."""
01:11:03;01:11:08;"And then actually, sidebar, your road manager, Brian,"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"had me make a playlist for the Santa Ana shows."
01:11:10;01:11:10;"Oh."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Don't know if you noticed it."
01:11:12;01:11:12;"No, well..."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"It was a similar theme."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"I'm always like..."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"I got you."
01:11:15;01:11:19;"Cloistered away, warming up and inhaling steam and all the things I do before a show."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Meditating."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Meditating before the show."
01:11:22;01:11:30;"But I was up in one of the backstage rooms at the observatory and through the floorboards,"
01:11:30;01:11:35;"I could kind of hear two big star songs in a row and I wondered."
01:11:35;01:11:35;"Okay."
01:11:35;01:11:36;"I don't even remember, but yeah."
01:11:36;01:11:37;"Was there a big star on it?"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"I'm sure there was."
01:11:38;01:11:38;"Yes."
01:11:38;01:11:41;"Anyway, they say, ""Thanks for always riding shotgun on our Sundays."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Much love, Kevin and Betsy."""
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Well..."
01:11:44;01:11:44;"Hell of an email."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Hell of an email."
01:11:46;01:11:46;"We kind of..."
01:11:46;01:11:49;"I mean, I don't know if I'm reading between the lines too much,"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"but it sounds like Time Crisis saved their marriage."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"Created their marriage."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"Two people coming back together, making the big leap move in LA, not feeling it."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"TC is the glue."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"That Sunday glue."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Listening live together is strong."
01:12:04;01:12:04;"Yeah, I'm into that."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"TC couples."
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Love these kind of emails."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"If you got any kind of TC situation..."
01:12:10;01:12:14;"And like we said, it doesn't have to be a romantic relationship."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"It could just be friends."
01:12:16;01:12:20;"Just a group of friends who come together to listen to live internet radio."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Honestly, I wish I had that in my own life."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"I wish there was a..."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"What's the Time Crisis for me that I could listen to?"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Howard."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Howard."
01:12:29;01:12:32;"I guess it's cool that this show is on a Sunday."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"I never really thought about it that much."
01:12:34;01:12:34;"Yeah."
01:12:34;01:12:37;"It gives it a different kind of energy."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"Yeah, imagine if this show just aired 9pm on Tuesdays."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Wouldn't seem as special."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"This is a Sunday afternoon show."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"Anyway, shout out to Kevin and Betsy and congrats on your nuptials."
01:12:48;01:12:53;"Won't you let me walk you home from school?"
01:12:58;01:13:07;"Won't you let me meet you at the pool?"
01:13:07;01:13:15;"Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the dance."
01:13:18;01:13:30;"And I'll take you home."
01:13:30;01:13:34;"Won't you tell your dad to get off my back?"
01:13:34;01:13:42;"Tell him what we said about painted black."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"Rock and roll is here to stay."
01:13:50;01:13:54;"Come inside when it's okay."
01:13:54;01:14:04;"I'll shake you."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Ooh."
01:14:06;01:14:18;"Ooh."
01:14:34;01:14:38;"Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?"
01:14:38;01:14:46;"Would you be an outlaw for my love?"
01:14:46;01:14:53;"If it's so, let me know."
01:14:53;01:15:00;"If it's done, well, I can go."
01:15:00;01:15:05;"I won't make you."
01:15:05;01:15:09;"Ooh."
01:15:09;01:15:17;"All right, it's time to get in the top five."
01:15:17;01:15:24;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"Okay, so this week on the Time Crisis, top five."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"This is a complicated one."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"It is a little complex."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"So everybody at home, I want you to grab a pencil and paper"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"and chart this thing out."
01:15:35;01:15:40;"We're not doing our usual just top five songs on iTunes versus Billboard of the past."
01:15:40;01:15:45;"We're looking at two different lists of summer songs."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"Because summer solstice has happened last week, right?"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"Because we're officially in summer."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Can you believe it?"
01:15:50;01:15:50;"No, I can't."
01:15:50;01:15:51;"The year's half over."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"It's insane."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"That's crazy."
01:15:53;01:15:53;"I don't like that."
01:15:53;01:15:58;"We're comparing a Billboard list of the songs of the summer."
01:15:58;01:16:05;"And this is Billboard kind of speculating based on radio airplay, sales data, blah, blah, blah."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"What they think the songs of this summer are."
01:16:07;01:16:07;"Whoa."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"So they're okay."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"So it's a Billboard list of this speculative songs of this summer."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Kind of jumping the gun."
01:16:12;01:16:16;"Well, that's what we do on the clickbait economy."
01:16:16;01:16:16;"Okay."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"Billboard's calling it."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"I don't know if I like it."
01:16:19;01:16:20;"There's songs that are going to come out next week."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Billboard's calling it now."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Oh, Drake."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Cool."
01:16:25;01:16:28;"I'm already negative about it."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Then we're going to compare that to Rolling Stone."
01:16:30;01:16:31;"Yeah."
01:16:31;01:16:35;"Who has their list of just the top five songs of all time."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"So in a way, we're still-"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Summer songs."
01:16:37;01:16:37;"Summer songs."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"We are comparing old and new again."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"Okay."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"So according to Rolling Stone, the number five summer song of all time,"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"Rockaway Beach by the Ramones."
01:16:46;01:16:46;"Okay."
01:16:46;01:16:51;"I always like this song."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"Five seems a little high."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I mean, I love the Ramones."
01:16:56;01:16:59;"I would have thought this would have been like 25."
01:16:59;01:17:03;"I mean, Rolling Stone is a very rock-oriented publication."
01:17:03;01:17:07;"I haven't heard the Ramones in a minute."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"Yeah."
01:17:09;01:17:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Maybe it's time-"
01:17:14;01:17:28;"Rock, rock away beach."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Did they do a record with Bill Spector?"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Is this on that record?"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"No."
01:17:34;01:17:37;"I like that."
01:17:37;01:17:47;"Yeah."
01:17:47;01:18:13;"Rock, rock, rock away beach."
01:18:13;01:18:21;"We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach."
01:18:21;01:18:33;"I feel like right now, that kind of like early punk is not very fashionable."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"It's not?"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"No."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"You don't hear people talking about the Ramones anymore."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"Really?"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"I feel like they're kind of evergreen."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"No, I think so."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Like the Beatles or something."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"Like it's all, there's always someone that's into that stuff, right?"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"I hope so."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"My brother's first show was the Ramones."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"Really?"
01:18:50;01:18:50;"You took him?"
01:18:50;01:18:51;"No, I didn't take him."
01:18:51;01:18:52;"My dad took him."
01:18:52;01:18:56;"I might've been out of the house at that point."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"I might've been in college, but I remember my brother was obsessed with the Ramones"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"and they were opening for White Zombie."
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Oh, I like White Zombie."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"In Hartford, Connecticut."
01:19:05;01:19:09;"And so my dad took my brother and he, yeah, he must've been like 13"
01:19:09;01:19:12;"and they watched like a 40 minute Ramones set."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"And then bounced."
01:19:13;01:19:16;"Missed opportunity to see more human than human live."
01:19:16;01:19:17;"I like White Zombie."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"Dave regrets that to this day."
01:19:19;01:19:20;"I'm sure he does."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"As does my dad."
01:19:21;01:19:26;"Dad was like, Dave, let's get the f*** out of here, man."
01:19:26;01:19:27;"White Zombie sucks."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"Come on, dad."
01:19:28;01:19:31;"And then like four years later, my dad's like, you know what?"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"I like some of the Rob Zombie solo stuff."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"I ended up getting into Rob Zombie a little later."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"White Zombie."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Rob and White."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"And I kind of regret walking out of that show now."
01:19:43;01:19:48;"Yeah, you know, the Dragula by Rob Zombie."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"Yeah, you know what?"
01:19:49;01:19:52;"I'll admit I went back to some of the White Zombie stuff."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"It was cool, man."
01:19:54;01:19:54;"It's pretty cool."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Hell of a director too."
01:19:56;01:20:00;"Actually got into him via the film side."
01:20:00;01:20:06;"The number five song, according to Billboard for the Song of the Summer,"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"is Lucid Dreams by Juice WRLD."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Juice WRLD?"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Yeah."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"That's a dope name."
01:20:13;01:20:17;"It's Juice and then WRLD is all caps W-R-L-D."
01:20:17;01:20:21;"Yeah, Juice WRLD is, I don't know if people still call it like SoundCloud rap,"
01:20:21;01:20:27;"but this is like a very big rapper kind of coming out of the modern internet environment."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Okay."
01:20:28;01:20:28;"Very popular."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Real into juicing."
01:20:30;01:20:32;"I guess so."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"Juice WRLD kind of could have been an indie band back in the day."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Oh, totally."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"I mean, my immediate association-"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Hi, we're Juice WRLD."
01:20:40;01:20:42;"Thanks for coming out tonight."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Thanks for coming out."
01:20:43;01:20:46;"This one's called Kale, Carrot, and Apple."
01:20:46;01:20:51;"Or they would be like, I could totally picture like an early 2000s indie band called Juice"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"WRLD and then they have a song called Juice WRLD."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"Hi, we're Juice WRLD."
01:20:56;01:20:57;"This song's Juice WRLD."
01:21:05;01:21:08;"Juice WRLD."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"It's kind of awkward harmonies."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"What?"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Cool fantasy."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"Juice WRLD."
01:21:15;01:21:21;"50s chord progression."
01:21:21;01:21:26;"Juice WRLD."
01:21:26;01:21:30;"Juice WRLD."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"Juice WRLD."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Maybe that should be on the next Vampire Weekend album."
01:21:38;01:21:44;"My immediate thought was he's talking about juicing fruits and vegetables,"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"but then I was thinking maybe he's talking roids."
01:21:47;01:21:53;"I have a feeling it's neither, but I like the roids concept."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Neither?"
01:21:54;01:21:54;"What else could it be?"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"I mean-"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"It could be anything."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"Does anybody know what Juice WRLD references?"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"Okay."
01:22:02;01:22:05;"So we just got some info that originally he was called Juice the Kid"
01:22:05;01:22:08;"and calling yourself Juice is classic."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"You don't need to explain that."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Juice is a positive thing."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"It's classic?"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"That's OJ."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"Right."
01:22:16;01:22:16;"Called him Juice."
01:22:16;01:22:22;"And like Juice is generally whatever slang version you use, it's like a positive thing."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"Chromio song, you got the juice."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I just think it was David Schwimmer going, ""Juice!"""
01:22:27;01:22:29;"Wait, what is that from Friends?"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"No, from the OJ show."
01:22:31;01:22:35;"Oh, oh, David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian."
01:22:35;01:22:35;"Juice!"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"Oh, Juice, no!"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"Juice!"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"So anyway, Juice the Kid."
01:22:41;01:22:45;"So he was Juice the Kid and then he kind of got classed it up and called Juice WRLD."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"With a little more modern."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"All right, cool."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"Anyway-"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"Let's listen to the song."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"This is a record from 2001 by Juice WRLD."

01:26:17;01:26:20;"the one Listening to my heart instead of my head"
01:26:20;01:26:25;"You found another one but I am the better one I won't let you forget me"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Shout out to Juice WRLD."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"I mean, that's pretty d-- Rockaway Beach vs. Lucid Dreams by Juice WRLD."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"That's a toss up."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"Very, I mean, totally, depends."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"It depends on whether the rich girl broke your heart or not."
01:26:39;01:26:43;"Number four on the Rolling Stone list, California Girls by The Beach Boys."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Okay."
01:26:44;01:26:51;"Kind of foreshadowing head sounds here."
01:26:51;01:26:59;"Yeah, this is pretty intricate."
01:26:59;01:27:06;"It was like saxophones harmonizing or whatever that is."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"Yeah, now it kind of, yeah."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Mike Love."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Coast girls are hip."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Dig those styles they wear."
01:27:12;01:27:26;"And the southern girls with the way they talk, they knock me out when I'm down there."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"The Midwest farms are built."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Pretty weak song."
01:27:29;01:27:34;"You know, I've never really analyzed this song, but it's funny that he's like, ""Shh."""
01:27:34;01:27:36;"The northern girls?"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"Yeah, it was like Minnesota?"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Like Game of Thrones?"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"We're just here."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"The west coast has the sunshine and the girls are the sunshine."
01:27:54;01:28:15;"The west coast has the sunshine and the girls are the sunshine."
01:28:16;01:28:24;"I've been all around this great big world and I've seen all kind of girls."
01:28:24;01:28:32;"Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states and back to the cutest girls in the world."
01:28:32;01:28:37;"I wish they all could be California."
01:28:37;01:28:41;"I wish they all could be California."
01:28:41;01:28:51;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:28:51;01:28:54;"Is he saying, wait, yeah, I don't understand."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Beat or be?"
01:28:55;01:28:59;"I wish they could all could be California."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Beat?"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Yeah, like."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"For the longest time I thought it was beat."
01:29:04;01:29:08;"Like, I wish, like in a way it was almost like a generous sentiment."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Like, I wish they could all measure up."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"I mean, it's kind of the same sentiment, really."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"You mean he's."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"I don't know why I thought it was beat."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"Like, I wish they could all top California girls."
01:29:18;01:29:22;"Wait, actually, I want to check because I just realized I don't know what this song's really about."
01:29:22;01:29:26;"I wish they could all be California girls."
01:29:26;01:29:34;"Because the west coast has the sunshine and the girls all get so tan."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"I dig a French bikini."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"On Hawaii Island?"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Is that what it is?"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Dolls by a palm tree in the sun."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"Oh, wait, hold on."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"We got to break this song down."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Verse one."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"See, this is what's funny."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"He basically."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Here we go, 20 minutes."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"Yeah, we're about to do a whole 20."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"We're going to need to preempt the next show."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Push into hour three."
01:29:52;01:29:55;"This is going to be a four hour TC."
01:29:55;01:30:00;"So the first verse of this is east coast girls are hip."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"I really dig those styles they wear."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"And then he lists all these other girls and how great they are."
01:30:04;01:30:08;"Southern girls with the way they talk, they knock me out when I'm down there."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Like southern accents."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"So he's just saying all these girls are great."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"And then with no transition, so like it ends,"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"and the northern girls with the way they kiss,"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"they keep their boyfriends warm at night."
01:30:18;01:30:22;"And then just hard change."
01:30:22;01:30:27;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"It's like there's not."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"In another song, then there would be like a pre-chorus."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"Right."
01:30:32;01:30:35;"Where it's kind of like however great all these girls are,"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"I'm a California boy."
01:30:38;01:30:41;"And so it's just like this weird hard cut where you're just like --"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Well, it's concise, man."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"We understand the logic."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"Okay."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"But is it so clear?"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"It's not as clear as it seems."
01:30:47;01:30:48;"Think about it."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"This is probably like 17-year-old dudes writing a song."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"[Laughter]"
01:30:54;01:30:57;"But here's my question."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"When you list all these great girls around the country,"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"he doesn't have a bad word to say about them."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"They're all great."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"And then he says, ""I wish they all could be California girls."""
01:31:07;01:31:12;"Is he saying that California girls are better than them?"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"Or is he saying that I wish when I go around the country"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"and I see these other great types of girls,"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"I'm blown away by how amazing they are."
01:31:22;01:31:26;"But because they don't live in California, they don't exist to me."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I wish that these hip East Coast girls --"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"They could all move there."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"I wish they could all move to California."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Is that what he's saying?"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"No."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"So what's he saying?"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"I understand the logic of what you're saying,"
01:31:37;01:31:40;"and it sort of relates to what I thought it was for years,"
01:31:40;01:31:43;"which I wish they could all beat California girls."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Right."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"Because he loves the Midwest farmer's daughter."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"She makes him feel all right."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Son, I wish I could accept you at this university,"
01:31:51;01:31:55;"but your grades just are not up to snuff."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"That's what he's kind of saying?"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Yeah."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"So he's saying--"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"That's the implication."
01:32:01;01:32:04;"All around this country I've met so many amazing girls,"
01:32:04;01:32:07;"and here's some of the great things I've learned about them."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"It's like ""The Bachelor."""
01:32:09;01:32:12;"However, at the end of the day, I'm giving my rose to California girls"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"because of the rest of you."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"That's what he's saying?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Yes."
01:32:16;01:32:20;"I think he's saying that he wishes that California would encompass the entire U.S."
01:32:20;01:32:21;"Oh, wow."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"I don't know about that."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"Or maybe it's like a Romeo and Juliet thing."
01:32:25;01:32:29;"Maybe his dad's real conservative, doesn't like him dating outside California."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"This is why the song has legs."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"It's a truly mysterious chorus."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"My family--"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Wish they could all be California girls."
01:32:37;01:32:41;"The Wilson family's been in California for over 32 years."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"We have deep roots here,"
01:32:43;01:32:49;"and if my father caught me necking with a hippies coast girl,"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"he would beat the shit out of me."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"I'm sorry."
01:32:52;01:32:55;"It's not right, but that's just how it has to be."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"I can only date a California girl."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"I wish you could be."
01:32:59;01:33:03;"Well, I can be a California girl, Brian."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"All I have to do is move."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"It's the same country."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"Doesn't count."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Nope."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"My family doesn't recognize conversions."
01:33:11;01:33:15;"The West Coast has the sunshine."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Is there anything else to this?"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"And the girls."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Yeah, there's no more information."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"I guess then at the end he says,"
01:33:22;01:33:26;"I've been all around this great big world, and I've seen all kinds of girls."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"But I couldn't wait to get back to the states,"
01:33:28;01:33:31;"back to the cutest girls in the world."
01:33:31;01:33:35;"But see, again, now he's saying American girls are cuter than the rest of the world?"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Imagine if there was an extended version"
01:33:37;01:33:41;"where he's talking about French girls and Italian girls."
01:33:41;01:33:45;"There's that Rick Nelson song ""Traveling Man"" that's in that vein."
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Rough stuff."
01:33:48;01:33:53;"The number four song on the Billboard list of the potential songs of the summer."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"Potential?"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"That's the best list."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"No surprise here, Drake, ""God's Plan."""
01:33:58;01:34:01;"This came out in like February or something."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"Yeah, this song is--"
01:34:02;01:34:03;"Not a song."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"--not losing steam by now."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"It already peaked."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""GOD'S PLAN""]"
01:34:06;01:34:10;"(SINGING) Yeah."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"I've been moving calm, don't start no trouble with me."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Trying to keep it peaceful is a struggle for me."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"I wonder if Mike Gloves heard this."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"You know how I like it when you loving on me."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"I don't want a God for them to miss me."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"Yes, I see the things that they wishing on me."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"Hope I got some brothers that'll live me."
01:34:31;01:34:35;"They gon' tell the story what's different with me."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"God's plan."
01:34:39;01:34:42;"I hold back sometimes I won't."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"I feel good sometimes I don't."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"I finesse down Western road like this."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"Might go down to GOD."
01:34:51;01:34:54;"I go hard on Southside G."
01:34:54;01:34:58;"I make sure that Northside heat."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"And still."
01:35:00;01:35:04;"Drake did a lot more nuanced talk"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"about life and relationships than California girls."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"How old is Drake, you think, like 30?"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Yeah."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"OK."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Beach Boys were like 17, 18."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"When they wrote California Girls."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Maybe 20."
01:35:15;01:35:20;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"The number three song on Rolling Stone's list--"

01:35:59;01:36:03;"And Black Savages being about the meaninglessness of life."

01:39:38;01:39:41;"I'm a district in the chain."
01:39:45;01:39:48;"It's infectious."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Oh, he's so handsome."
01:39:49;01:39:52;"What's his name?"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"I need the dollars to change."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"Beat it up like piñata."

01:40:13;01:40:15;"How's your Spanish, Jake?"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"Not solid."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Have you studied it?"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"I took it for years, probably eight years."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"Can you get anything out of it?"
01:40:22;01:40:25;"[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]"
01:40:25;01:40:36;"Oh, viva la raza."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"That's--"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"What does that mean?"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"--a familiar phrase."
01:40:40;01:40:45;"Like viva la raza, like la raza referring to the people."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"Long live the race."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Sounds a little scary when you say it in English."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"That's not a phrase you want to hear in English."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"A couple white guys on the mic, long live the race."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"Yeah, you don't want to hear that."
01:40:56;01:40:59;"But viva la raza, you see that here and there."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"I can't follow Spanish at all when it's spoken."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"What about when it's sung or rapped?"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"Even less so."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Even less so?"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"You know why?"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"They don't enunciate."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"You got to enunciate."
01:41:10;01:41:14;"I feel like Spanish rappers enunciate even more."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"Do they?"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"Like, I don't understand Spanish at all."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"But I feel like when I listen to Spanish music,"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"it's like the language that I feel like I, in some weird way,"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"follow."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"When I hear a story song, I almost"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"feel like just through the emotion of the vocal,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"I can follow it a little bit."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"You studied French."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"I studied French."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Big mistake."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"I like it."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"I mean, I don't know."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"That might be my pick for song of the summer."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"It's just plain fun."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"I was actually thinking about it, because like--"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"It's just plain fun."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"I just always hear that in Ubers."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"It's just-- it's good, clean fun."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"I always hear it in Ubers."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"And actually, the thing--"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Cardi B's songs, there's always these little lines that"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"just stick with you."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"They're very sticky."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"In fact, before the show, for whatever reason,"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"I had one of the lines that said,"
01:41:58;01:42:03;"I like Texas from my exes when they want a second chance."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Also, some of the lyrics in this,"
01:42:05;01:42:08;"almost nobody else could pull off besides Cardi B."
01:42:08;01:42:11;"As we said on the show, she's incredibly charismatic."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"It's just fun to hear her."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"And for instance, she goes, he's so handsome."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"What's his name?"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Like, that line is right on the border"
01:42:20;01:42:24;"of being super corny, but also kind of cute and fun."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"There's other people who would have that line"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"and would just be like, ugh."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Right."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"But with Cardi B, she brings that playfulness,"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"but she's also kind of tough."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"She's got it all."
01:42:33;01:42:34;"He's so handsome."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"What's his name?"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Taylor would have a tough time pulling that one off."
01:42:38;01:42:39;"He's so handsome."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"What's his name?"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Yeah, the--"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Name."
01:42:42;01:42:43;"What's his name?"
01:42:43;01:42:46;"Well, Taylor, his name is Jordan."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"He's so handsome."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"What's his name?"

01:42:53;01:42:57;"Everybody finds their own voice one way or another."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"The number two song on the Rolling Stone list--"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"The Rolling Stone list is kind of boring, I got to admit."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"I think the Billboard list is just more interesting."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"The number two-- I guess because Rolling Stone"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"was just trying to be like, a song that's explicitly"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"about summer."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Right, let's not--"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"They weren't just kind of going for like, yeah,"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"songs that came out in the summer that give you"

01:43:58;01:44:01;"This was on the La Bamba soundtrack, which"

01:46:09;01:46:10;"That's the chorus."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"It's one of these classic kind of long--"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Right."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"So he says, got diamonds by the boatload."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"That's not hard to understand."
01:46:16;01:46:17;"That's a lot of diamonds."
01:46:17;01:46:20;"He said-- and he says, come with the Tony Romo."

01:46:26;01:46:27;"Yeah."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Not Tony Romo's."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"The chain restaurant."
01:46:32;01:46:35;"Because that's with an A, Roma."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"Yeah, Tony Romo's."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"OK, yeah."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"It's like an Olive Garden."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Actually, I've never really been there."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"I've always been confused by that,"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"because I wondered if Tony Romo started it,"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"because football players often start,"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"like, that type of restaurant."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I think it was around before his career was really--"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Right, yeah, it's older."
01:46:50;01:46:53;"No, so he's talking about the football player."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"So I looked it up for my friend, because I"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"didn't have the answer."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"He comes with the Tony Romo to deal with the bozos."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"That's pushing it."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"This is what it says on the internet."
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Well, and also Post Malone grew up in Texas."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"Diehard Dallas Cowboys fan, which is the team that I"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"believe Tony Romo played for."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"I guess so."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Yeah, confirmed."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"You listen to Time Crisis Sports Talk."
01:47:17;01:47:20;"Who did Tony Romo play for again?"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"The Dallas Mavericks?"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"Cowboys, I mean."
01:47:23;01:47:27;"Cool joke."
01:47:27;01:47:30;"We got Phil calling in from Houston."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Today we're talking about-- we're talking about the"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"upcoming football season."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"The question of the day is, what team did Tony Romo play for?"
01:47:37;01:47:38;"We're trying to get to the bottom of this."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Phil, you got any insight?"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"OK, Phil's saying Dallas Cowboys."
01:47:42;01:47:45;"Not sure about that one, but anyway."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Back to the phones."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Back to the phones."
01:47:48;01:47:52;"Just like do a really serious sports talk radio show where"
01:47:52;01:47:58;"we're just asking real questions about what really is a touchdown."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"I mean, we're all football fans."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"We think we know what a touchdown is, but how would you define it?"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"Call in and give us your take."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"So Tony Romo-- this is what the internet said."
01:48:07;01:48:12;"Tony Romo played for the Dallas Cowboys, and he always wore the same number."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"OK, isn't that pretty normal?"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"You get a number, you wear that for your career."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"No, it wasn't done."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Oh."
01:48:19;01:48:22;"The number, nine."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"OK."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"You following this?"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"He wore the number nine."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"Now go back to the context."
01:48:29;01:48:33;"I come with the Tony Romo and something for the bozos."
01:48:33;01:48:36;"OK, he's got the boatload of diamonds."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Don't worry about the diamonds anymore."
01:48:38;01:48:42;"He's rolling in-- he's wearing a jersey."
01:48:42;01:48:46;"He's wearing a Tony Romo."
01:48:46;01:48:54;"He's bought into a partial stake at Dallas area Tony Romo's restaurants."
01:48:54;01:48:56;"No, here's the full line."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Plain English, here we go."
01:48:58;01:49:03;"Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"I don't understand how nine is a significant part of this."
01:49:07;01:49:12;"What else does the number nine refer to?"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"OK, so let's take out the Tony Romo."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"I don't know, man."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"There could be a lot of things, dude."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"There's nine players and a baseball diamond."
01:49:19;01:49:21;"That's why Post Malone is a genius."
01:49:21;01:49:26;"He uses football as a metaphor for a baseball team."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"No."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"So think about it."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Replace Tony Romo for nine."
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I come with the nine for clowns and all the bozos."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Oh, he's bringing a gun."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"That's right."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"That is a stretch."
01:49:39;01:49:45;"And the thing that I'm not sure about is, is that a thing that people say,"
01:49:45;01:49:50;"or is this just a Dallas Cowboys fan who's now become a famous rapper"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"just throwing in something kind of special for his community?"
