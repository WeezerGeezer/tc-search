00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis back again. Many changes are afoot. From downtown Los Angeles all the"
00:10;00:15;"way to the United Kingdom we're joined in the studio by rock legend Rod Stewart."
00:15;00:22;"We talk about everything from trains to football to the tears of Hercules. This"
00:22;00:30;"is a very special Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:21;"Time Crisis back again. Hell of a show today. We'll be joined by rock legend Rod"
01:21;01:29;"Stewart in a little bit but first some truly shocking news this week. I kind of"
01:29;01:34;"can't believe it but we just found out Staples Center, beloved arena, maybe not"
01:34;01:39;"that beloved but an arena in downtown Los Angeles. It's where the Lakers play,"
01:39;01:44;"it's where the Clippers play, it's where the Kings play. It will be changing its"
01:44;01:49;"name because somebody knew about the rights and before we talk about it I was"
01:49;01:53;"I was just having this discussion with somebody. I broke the news to them."
01:53;01:57;"Actually it was a friend of the show Ariel Rechshied sitting in the studio with him"
01:57;02:01;"and I was like oh man and he was like what and I told him he's like old-school"
02:01;02:03;"LA dude I was like you're not gonna believe this they're changing the name"
02:03;02:08;"of Staples Center the first thing he says oh god what is it and so before I say it"
02:08;02:12;"I kind of remember I think we've talked about it on the show that the Staples"
02:12;02:18;"Center is one of the classiest arena names. We've had this discussion right?"
02:18;02:22;"I think so. You could be like the Dunkin Donuts Center in Rhode Island you could"
02:22;02:28;"end up being Smoothie King Arena where the Pelicans play in New Orleans but we"
02:28;02:31;"talked about the fact that is if you're gonna have a sponsored name you're not"
02:31;02:34;"gonna be Madison Square Garden you're gonna have a sponsored name there's"
02:34;02:38;"something about Staples Center that just sounds like somebody's name you don't"
02:38;02:43;"even think about the fact that it's a weird office supply chain and I believe"
02:43;02:48;"the discussion we had on TC went along the lines of like LA is so lucky imagine"
02:48;02:51;"if instead of Staples coming through with the naming rights it had been"
02:51;02:56;"Office Depot it would be just such a shame be such an embarrassment for the"
02:56;03:00;"city. LA is really lucky and then we even I believe we even had a discussion maybe"
03:00;03:06;"LA because it's LA they got all these offers Office Depot came through you"
03:06;03:10;"know who knows what else Burger King Taco Bell whatever and they said no no"
03:10;03:14;"no it has to sound good and then Staples came through and they said you got it"
03:14;03:19;"because that sounds good. We're the second biggest city in America we need"
03:19;03:24;"the money but we're not gonna take some dorky name that'd be an embarrassment to"
03:24;03:27;"the City of Angels so anyway they have this great name Staples Center and it"
03:27;03:32;"really goes down easy it's a win-win for everybody. Turns out that theory was"
03:32;03:38;"wrong. That theory was deeply wrong or a lot has changed in the past 22 years so"
03:38;03:42;"because we've had this discussion I was very interested to see what is the new"
03:42;03:46;"name of the Staples Center who bought the naming rights and what is this place"
03:46;03:50;"gonna become well I guess Seinfeld you're our number cruncher I'll let you"
03:50;03:54;"do the honors what is the new name of the Staples Center in downtown Los"
03:54;04:03;"Angeles the Staples Center will now be called crypto.com arena rolls off the"

04:26;04:31;"dropped the center I feel like they could have called it crypto center but"
04:31;04:36;"dot-com is kind of ruining it. It has to be crypto.com because that's the name of the"
04:36;04:43;"business if they just called it crypto center then you'd have all sorts of... That sounds terrifying. It's very Robocop."
04:43;04:48;"Civilian welcome to crypto center but crypto is too broad of a category"
04:48;04:52;"everybody in the crypto space benefits from the crypto center this is not about"
04:52;05:00;"coinbase it's not about friends with benefits it's not about NFT week this is"

08:34;08:39;"Englishman that has been living in LA for decades actually that's a good"
08:39;08:43;"question too I think you should phrase it just like that like so Rod another"
08:43;08:47;"iconic blonde Englishman has been living in LA for decades David Hockney you guys"
08:47;08:50;"friends I think the answer will be yes there's no way they haven't like party"

09:02;09:08;"show Daniel Ralston used to work at a bar at the Malibu Beach Inn which was"
09:08;09:13;"like a kind of a nice hotel in Malibu and Rod would come in with his mates and"
09:13;09:18;"watch football games oh his English mates he'd come in with his English mates"
09:18;09:22;"and watch the soccer games it like weird you know like what on the afternoon when"
09:22;09:27;"no one's in there just a ragtag group of Englishmen David Hockney Rod Stewart"
09:27;09:35;"Stephen Hawking Prince Charles I mean you got a picture Branson oh yeah"
09:35;09:42;"Richard Branson that's a good crew right there anyway the I can only um I don't"
09:42;09:49;"care personally that it's got this terrible name but if California does"
09:49;09:53;"fall into the sea within the next 20 years you heard it here first it's"
09:53;09:59;"because of this this brings some serious you know biblical type evil into the"
09:59;10:03;"Golden State I wish Warren Zeevon was still alive to write a song about this"
10:03;10:08;"oh god yeah he would love it it's really is like a perfect metaphor for like the"
10:08;10:14;"direction of our economy and society I mean the late 90s you know big-box"
10:14;10:19;"retailers were king yep and even if you know it was a little funny and tacky to"
10:19;10:26;"have Staples an office supply retailer big-box went out on the bidding war"
10:26;10:31;"granted with a classy name it's really you know the brick-and-mortar era is uh"
10:31;10:37;"phasing out and we're gonna do this here for the next 20 years I also want to say"
10:37;10:41;"that we're not anti crypto on this show I mean we did a whole special about NFT"
10:41;10:48;"week with the desk spot so we're very pro crypto pro NFT are we well I don't"
10:48;10:54;"know about NFTs we never really we're not anti crypto I just want to say"
10:54;10:58;"though it's like one funny thing though is that when people talk about crypto"
10:58;11:02;"and the blockchain and how that could change the way that people interact and"
11:02;11:08;"change everything you know it would be cool if you told me that 1 million"
11:08;11:12;"people on the blockchain somehow came together to buy the naming rights for"
11:12;11:18;"Staples Center and they called it you know gave it some like crazy funny name"
11:18;11:25;"ass arena yeah even if they call it ass arena or if they just pick something"
11:25;11:29;"like you know it would be cool if you told me that 1 million people globally"
11:29;11:35;"using aetherium bought the naming rights and they bought it that's so it would"
11:35;11:39;"cost so much money it was the highest naming rights by many country miles like"
11:39;11:43;"they bought it for five billion dollars and they just named it a 200 digit"
11:43;11:49;"number you know something like weird like that like literally five seven nine"
11:49;11:54;"five one two three seven six oh zero zero you know arena and they're like for"
11:54;11:58;"short and it they just call it like like numbers arena or whatever I'd be like"
11:58;12:02;"all right that rules yeah this is the dream of just like weird happening"
12:02;12:07;"because powerful corporations don't get the naming rights anymore or like they"
12:07;12:11;"named it after some like hacker legend like who's that guy that the the hackers"
12:11;12:16;"love Aaron Swartz if they named it after some legend I don't know Julian Assange"
12:16;12:22;"arena yeah like that crowdsourced right then I'd be like wow the black chain"
12:22;12:29;"Edward Snowden arena you know just some legends of a legend of leaks or hacks or"
12:29;12:33;"I don't know like or just a joke I mean it'd be pretty lame but you know like"
12:33;12:38;"not this but like Harambe arena again lame but I was gonna say bored ape"
12:38;12:42;"arena would have been even bored a you know would be would be slightly better"
12:42;12:46;"all I'm saying is that yeah you see where I'm going with this that would be"
12:46;12:51;"like wow the blockchain is changing culture it's wild and wacky and like"
12:51;12:57;"hackery and like whatever and decentralized you know but instead it's"
12:57;13:00;"like just the same old thing crypto.com you know what I mean it's like yeah an"
13:00;13:05;"even worse version so again not anti black chain not even anti crypto.com I"
13:05;13:09;"got to talk to Matt Damon to really have an opinion but you know it's just like"
13:09;13:13;"kind of lame but I think we should go even one step further back because this"
13:13;13:18;"really tracks like something culturally before is the Staples Center before was"
13:18;13:24;"even built where did the Lakers play? The Forum. And the Forum had various names"
13:24;13:27;"actually Seinfeld can you look up the forum had a few funny names at some"
13:27;13:31;"point it was called the Great Western Forum from a bank and before that it was"
13:31;13:35;"oh that was from a bank interesting I think so and I think before that it was"
13:35;13:38;"like the fantastic form but I think originally was just the forum man they"
13:38;13:45;"better not off auction off the rights to Dodger Stadium. So initially it was named"
13:45;13:52;"after Great Western Savings and Loan as the Great Western Forum then it was"
13:52;13:58;"acquired by Washington Mutual now Chase Bank and it was changed to just the"
13:58;14:04;"forum. I mean these companies had restraint back then. Washington"
14:04;14:07;"Mutual dropped some coin on and they said you know what let's be classy we're"
14:07;14:13;"just gonna call it the forum if you know you know. If you know you know"
14:13;14:18;"arena. Wow who owns if you know you know arena? You got to do a little bit of digging."
14:18;14:22;"It's actually Wendy's right it's very cool that they didn't call it Wendy's"
14:22;14:28;"arena. Oh yeah that is cool I've been meaning to go there. But that's always"
14:28;14:34;"been the case right Paramount is a Gulf and Western company you know from"
14:34;14:38;"the beginning. Back then you know mid-century people were more discreet"
14:38;14:43;"and more tasteful it was a zenith of this country and I think it reflects I"
14:43;14:47;"think you could totally write a credible thesis on naming of arenas and the"
14:47;14:51;"decline of America. What's also fun yeah at some point it was called the forum"
14:51;14:58;"which truly actually sounds like Roman and actually totally from the forum to"
14:58;15:02;"Staples Center to crypto.com arena. Wait but was there anything in between"
15:02;15:08;"Seinfeld? Oh wow well it apparently currently the forum is actually known as"
15:08;15:14;"the forum presented by Chase is the full name of the forum. They just oh god."
15:14;15:19;"Yeah I'm not seeing anything kind of in between that seems like it was here is"
15:19;15:25;"the forum Great Western Forum and then back to the forum presented by Chase."
15:25;15:33;"Presented by Chase it's classy. It's so just don't it's it's somewhat classy."
15:33;15:38;"Staples Center was shortened to Staples right like would you say I'm going to"
15:38;15:42;"Staples? No you'd say I'm going to Staples Center. Oh yeah going to Staples"
15:42;15:47;"sounds like you're going to the to no one goes to Staples. I mean that's that"
15:47;15:51;"what's so amazing right? I mean well yeah by the way what's going on with the"
15:51;15:57;"Staples the company are they in trouble or did they just say you know what maybe"
15:57;16:01;"they knew that they were in a power position and like whoever owns the arena"
16:01;16:06;"came back like guys please don't make it look even if you can come in at half of"
16:06;16:10;"what crypto.com is offering well you can keep it and Staples said you know what"
16:10;16:15;"we just flashed out so much money over the last 22 years and everybody's gonna"
16:15;16:19;"always think of it as Staples Center and now they're in this power position where"
16:19;16:23;"they're like people are gonna be nostalgic for an office supplies store"
16:23;16:29;"they're winning. Nostalgic for an office supplies store. Well I mean and it just"
16:29;16:34;"sounds like the press release of a painting exhibition I just did. Staples"
16:34;16:39;"paid a hundred and sixteen million dollars for 20 years starting in 1999"
16:39;16:46;"and then they extended the agreement during the Great Recession 2009 so I"
16:46;16:52;"should also say that LA Times has an article about this and it quotes the"
16:52;16:57;"chief executive of crypto.com Chris Marselec as saying that the new name"
16:57;17:01;"will come to be seen as a sign of the times and he has a quote here in the"
17:01;17:04;"next few years people will look back at this moment as the moment when crypto"
17:04;17:09;"crossed the chasm into the mainstream. Marselec said when reached at his home"
17:09;17:14;"in Hong Kong this is just a brilliant move from the guys at AEG because the"
17:14;17:19;"next decade belongs to crypto he said. He said this is a brilliant move by AEG"
17:19;17:25;"for accepting my 700 million dollars. It's kind of weird to be the guy from"
17:25;17:30;"crypto.com saying great move on AEG's part. I just came across an article"
17:30;17:34;"Paul George who plays for the Clippers he was asked what do you think about the"
17:34;17:39;"name change and he's from LA and he says it'll be weird I grew up with this being"
17:39;17:43;"Staples and Staples being the place to play and the place to be it'll"
17:43;17:46;"definitely be weird it's the same location but it's kind of like you're"
17:46;17:50;"stripping the history here by calling it something else from there going forward"
17:50;17:54;"I guess it's a new history to be written. Interesting quote but even then you're"
17:54;17:57;"now getting somebody to talk about an office supply store like Staples being"
17:57;18:01;"like well that's history man kind of stripping history yeah and he's right a"
18:01;18:05;"new history is being written in 20 years somebody might look back fondly on"
18:05;18:11;"crypto.com but yeah this truly is a milestone"
18:53;19:03;"Are we gonna ask Rod about crypto? Yeah I think this should be the first question"
19:03;19:08;"should at least be about the name change and if that opens up a lot of NFT talk"
19:08;19:12;"so be it. He's probably played the Staples Center right? As I understand he's been"
19:12;19:17;"an LA resident for many years well yeah let's get into it. We can start with"
19:17;19:19;"all the LA stuff."
19:19;19:24;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
19:24;19:26;"[Phone Ringing]"
19:26;19:30;"Ezra and Jake. Rod! Yeah!"
19:30;19:37;"Hey boys how are you? How's it going? Welcome to the show. Thank you lovely to be on first time on."
19:37;19:41;"Hopefully not the last but we're thrilled to have you. Thank you. We're huge fans"
19:41;19:47;"you're a legend and very excited about your new album Tears of Hercules but the"
19:47;19:52;"first thing we want to ask you about you're a longtime LA resident correct?"
19:52;19:58;"Since 1975. And that's kind of been your home base I imagine you're all over the"
19:58;20:02;"place but that's your home base? Yeah more or less yeah. So I imagine you've"
20:02;20:09;"probably been to performed at the Staples Center before? Yes yes. Have you"
20:09;20:14;"heard about the name change? No I've been locked up here for about 18 months. I"
20:14;20:19;"went back to LA to do Vegas last month otherwise I haven't been back there at"
20:19;20:24;"all. Okay you've been in the UK for quarantine? Yeah we've been locked down mate. The new name of the"
20:24;20:30;"Staples Center is the Crypto.com Arena. Is that bad? Well we just wanted to get"
20:30;20:43;"your reaction to it. I couldn't give a f***. Well that's probably the right attitude. It wasn't one of my favorite places to perform anyway. I love the Forum."
20:43;20:48;"And I think the Forum's been revamped now. It's got a much better sound. Were you playing"
20:48;20:53;"concerts at the Forum like back in the 70s? Yeah with the Faces yeah we used to"
20:53;20:58;"play the Forum quite regularly. I did it with Tina Turner once she came up and"
20:58;21:01;"sang when she had a second album out. Yeah I've done it loads of times. I"
21:01;21:08;"should imagine 20-30 times. I played Madison Square Garden about 50 times so"
21:08;21:16;"imagine the Forum's up there as well. Yeah I gotta check that. I know Elton's done it more than me."
21:16;21:24;"Yeah well one question that I've always wanted to ask you and I've always been"
21:24;21:28;"so curious about this is you're one of the greatest rock singers of all time."
21:28;21:35;"Oh behind yourself. You're up there but I've always been interested is that"
21:35;21:41;"you're such a great songwriter and yet in your catalog you have so equally"
21:41;21:46;"dispersed songs that you've written or co-written and then songs that other"
21:46;21:51;"people have written. You've done many albums in your series of covers."
21:51;21:55;"Obviously you have a great ear for identifying great songwriters. You've"
21:55;22:00;"covered Tom Waits multiple times so I'm just kind of curious about your"
22:00;22:06;"relationship to songwriting and how that kind of started and when you first kind"
22:06;22:11;"of like got into it. Oh that's a good story actually a good question. I'd never"
22:11;22:16;"put pen to paper while I was with all the bands I was with till I"
22:16;22:20;"joined the Jeff Beck group and then Jeff said we should start writing our own"
22:20;22:27;"songs for one of the two Jeff Beck albums. I think it was the second one and"
22:27;22:30;"Jeff said guys can you start writing songs. I said okay Ronnie and I said"
22:30;22:35;"we'll give it a go and so I went over to Ronnie's house which was a little tiny"
22:35;22:39;"council house. Do you know what a council house is? They're houses for the poor."
22:39;22:45;"Like government housing? Yeah yeah exactly yeah so I went over his house and"
22:45;22:50;"middle of winter we turned on the electric fire which had three bars and"
22:50;22:53;"then his mum came in and said you can only use one because it's expensive."
22:53;23:00;"That was very cold. We had a notepad and a piece of paper and a pencil and we"
23:00;23:05;"tried to write a Jeff Beck song and nothing came out and then we said well"
23:05;23:09;"let's have a glass of wine. So we had a bottle of wine between the two of us and"
23:09;23:15;"still nothing came out. But that was the first failed attempt at writing songs"
23:15;23:21;"was with Ronnie. We eventually got a song called Around the Plinths I think it was"
23:21;23:26;"for the Jeff Beck album but it was a struggle. Now it's so enjoyable I mean I"
23:26;23:31;"really love it you know I love the whole way we we put albums together. I'm not"
23:31;23:35;"saying everybody should do it this way but I do mine over the laptop you know"
23:35;23:42;"make alterations that way and it's so having spent probably you know 20 years"
23:42;23:46;"in studios with no light and no sunshine it's a relief to be able to do it that"
23:46;23:51;"way. But I enjoy the songwriting process now more than I've done in my entire"
23:51;23:56;"life. The faces used to lock me in a holiday in room you know they used to give me a bottle of wine,"
23:56;24:01;"tape recorder and a bit of paper and they'd lock the door till I got the lyrics because I was lazy."
24:01;24:09;"So you didn't particularly back then want to go spend a lot of time"
24:09;24:14;"writing songs? No, in those in the 70s there was too much shagging and drinking to do you know."
24:14;24:25;"Yeah. Party. Because the places were party bad. But even when you look at your early work the first couple you know solo"
24:25;24:30;"albums and the fact that Maggie Mae a song that you wrote or co-wrote becomes"
24:30;24:35;"this like huge hit that didn't make you feel like wow there's like really I'm"
24:35;24:39;"like the man I got to keep writing my own songs. Yeah, yeah I did and of course you may"
24:39;24:44;"know the story that that wasn't supposed to be on the album. That song was a B-side?"
24:44;24:49;"Yeah we only had eight tracks and the guys from Mercury Records out of Chicago"
24:49;24:52;"said we need another track and I said I'll have a look see what I've got. And I had"
24:52;24:57;"this unfinished song we didn't even have a title and I went and finished it with"
24:57;25:03;"Ronnie and Mac and there came Maggie Mae and it wasn't for a desk jockey in"
25:03;25:07;"Cleveland who turned it over because reason to believe was the A-side. B-side"
25:07;25:11;"was Maggie may not be talking to you today. It's amazing that it used to work"
25:11;25:14;"that way. It was Cleveland that turned the tide?"
25:14;25:21;"D-jockey in Cleveland turned it over. This is good let's play this. We were just talking recently"
25:21;25:25;"about there was a disc jockey in Cleveland that got Rush's career started."
25:25;25:30;"Well, yeah. Can't imagine it's the same guy because it's 50 years ago. It might have"
25:30;25:36;"been it was probably early 70s. Yeah, 1971. It was 50 years ago this month or next month."
25:36;25:41;"Wild. It was 50 years in March I think I'll check that out but maybe the same guy."
25:41;25:46;"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you."
25:46;25:54;"It's late September and I really should be back at school."
25:54;26:02;"I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used."
26:02;26:09;"Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore."
26:10;26:18;"You led me away from home just to save you from being alone."
26:18;26:22;"You stole my heart and that's what really hurts."
26:22;26:27;"Is it true that in the 70s like the Midwest was like true rock country? Did you have like"
26:27;26:32;"amazing shows in Ohio and Indiana? Do you have a special connection to that area?"
26:32;26:37;"No, not really. I mean with the Jeff Beck group we had a couple of cities. I'm going way back now"
26:38;26:45;"to '69, '68, '69. We had a couple of cities that we favored and one of them was Detroit and the"
26:45;26:51;"other one was Pittsburgh. It was always a great audience for us. Out West it wasn't so good."
26:51;26:55;"I can't remember the faces because we were all so drunk at the time."
26:55;27:02;"After everything went on with the faces. We drank too much that's for sure."
27:02;27:06;"Was your first trip to California with the faces?"
27:07;27:12;"No, the first trip was with the Jeff Beck group and we supported Pink Floyd at the"
27:12;27:17;"Anaheim Convention Center. It was our first tour. We support the Grateful Dead,"
27:17;27:21;"a lot of big bands, American bands."
27:21;27:22;"Whoa, you opened for the Grateful Dead?"
27:22;27:26;"Yeah, it was hard for them to follow us on I tell you."
27:26;27:32;"Americans have never seen anything like this, especially the likes, you know,"
27:33;27:39;"four white boys playing Chicago blues. Especially the way me and Ronnie used to look in those days."
27:39;27:46;"We had all these cross belt bottom trousers and pink crosses, enormous hair. Americans hadn't"
27:46;27:49;"seen anything like that in 1969."
27:49;27:54;"My dad has told me that he saw you play opening for Jimi Hendrix."
27:54;27:55;"Oh, that's right. Yeah."
27:55;28:00;"And he said it blew. Yeah, he was my dad because I grew up with your music."
28:00;28:03;"I'm a huge fan. My dad's a huge fan. But he would always tell that story"
28:03;28:08;"that he didn't know who you were. You guys opened for Hendrix and just like blew the stage out."
28:08;28:14;"Yeah, he followed us on. He was great. And I remember that. You know, millions of concerts,"
28:14;28:19;"you remember one. I remember it because I didn't go and solo to Jimi. You know,"
28:19;28:25;"I had a bit of a cold. Ronnie and Jeff went solo and Nicky Hopkins went to solo too. I go,"
28:25;28:29;"I feel so awful. I better not. I might give him a cold. Missed the opportunities."
28:29;28:33;"So that's how I remember that. Yeah. He was a lot better than us."
28:33;28:36;"Fire coming out of his arse."
28:36;28:37;"It sounds like, yeah."
28:37;28:42;"Throwing guitars up in the air. And, you know, he was great. Rest in peace, Jimi."
28:42;28:48;"Is it true that the faces would sometimes check into hotels as the Grateful Dead?"
28:48;28:49;"Fleetwood Mac."
28:49;28:53;"Oh, Fleetwood Mac? Because the faces had been banned?"
28:53;28:57;"Fleetwood Mac weren't known in those days. The Grateful Dead were. Fleetwood Mac hadn't broken"
28:57;29:02;"through. We were both bands were trying to cut through. So no one knew whether we were Fleetwood"
29:02;29:04;"Mac or the faces. No one really knew."
29:04;29:08;"And is that because the faces had been banned?"
29:08;29:14;"Yeah. Yeah. For, you know, silly behavior and, you know, the normal thing. We drilled through"
29:14;29:19;"walls because they were only breeze Brock. So we used to drill through the walls. So all the walls,"
29:19;29:24;"can't believe I'm telling you this, you know, we used to get really told off."
29:24;29:29;"And the reason we did it, we were so because the Holiday Inn used to treat us so badly,"
29:29;29:33;"like we were scum. You know what I mean? So that was our way of getting back at them."
29:33;29:37;"I saw an interview where you said they wouldn't even bring you room service."
29:37;29:40;"No, no, they just didn't want to. They didn't want to know us."
29:40;29:44;"You know, just because you were like rock and rollers or was like an anti."
29:44;29:45;"They thought you were hippies."
29:45;29:52;"We weren't hippies, but it was middle America, mostly, you know, like around Kansas and Des Moines."
29:52;29:58;"And so what was your impression of the Grateful Dead and like the San Francisco kind of hippie"
29:58;29:59;"scene?"
29:59;30:04;"It was lovely. It was lovely. It's probably the right word, but it didn't affect me and Ronnie."
30:04;30:10;"We had our own style, you know, we invented our own style. I was talking to someone about this"
30:10;30:14;"yesterday because on the new album, there's a tribute to Mark Bowlen and me and Mark were really"
30:14;30:19;"good friends. You know, we did a show with the faces with him where he was top of the bill and"
30:19;30:24;"we absolutely wiped the floor with him. You know, he was such a gentleman. He'd come in and say,"
30:24;30:30;"I can't follow you guys on. That was so great. Amniax would do that nowadays and we remain good"
30:30;30:36;"friends. But getting back to what you said, we all shopped in the same shop. It was called Granny"
30:36;30:43;"Takes a Trip in a King's Road. You know, so you go in there, you go in this shop and I've got all"
30:43;30:47;"that jacket there and they go, no, you don't want that. Bowie's got it. You go, oh, no,"
30:47;30:52;"Jagger's got that one. It was that close knit, you know. I've forgotten what your question was."
30:52;30:53;"Now I'm rambling."
30:53;30:57;"I was just your impressions of the Grateful Dead. We talk about them a lot in the show,"
30:57;31:02;"and it's been interesting to us. Such a huge band in the US, but never particularly crossed over"
31:02;31:04;"with English audiences."
31:04;31:08;"I can't tell you why. I mean, I must admit I wasn't a fan at all because it wasn't like the"
31:08;31:13;"sort of music I like. I like, you know, blues stuff, soul stuff. And their stuff sort of"
31:13;31:15;"rambled on for a few days, didn't it?"
31:15;31:18;"Yeah. Did you interact with them much when you did the show together"
31:18;31:20;"or you were kind of in your own universe?"
31:20;31:22;"Yeah. Yeah."
31:22;31:23;"Fair enough."

32:37;32:42;"So how is it that you ended up settling in California in 1975?"
32:42;32:45;"Something must have attracted you to LA."
32:45;32:47;"- It was something pushed me out of the UK."
32:47;32:53;"The taxes became, 93% of your money was going to be taken in taxes."
32:53;32:54;"- Tax man."
32:54;32:55;"- That was 1975."
32:55;32:58;"And in those days, everybody left."
32:58;33:02;"I think at one point, it was Eric Clapton, I think Joe Cocker, me,"
33:02;33:07;"maybe in the Bee Gees, a lot of people all went out on April the 5th,"
33:07;33:11;"the day before the fiscal year to get away from UK taxes."
33:11;33:13;"They were just diabolical."
33:13;33:17;"I mean, can you imagine just taking home 93% of what you earn?"
33:17;33:17;"It's not fair."
33:17;33:21;"- That's a, yeah, I think in the US in the 50s, it was the same too."
33:21;33:23;"- Was it really?"
33:23;33:28;"- Yeah, like during the Eisenhower years, it was for the very, very top earners,"
33:28;33:29;"it was like in the 90s."
33:29;33:32;"And of course, obviously, the Beatles wrote that famous song about it too."
33:32;33:33;"- ""Paying for the War."""
33:33;33:35;"- Yeah, right."
33:35;33:39;"- But so of all the places you could go, so we understand you were leaving the UK,"
33:39;33:42;"but was California just the most obvious choice to you?"
33:42;33:46;"- Oh, yeah, because I'd been there before and enjoyed it,"
33:46;33:50;"enjoyed the company of some beautiful girls, and of course, the sunshine."
33:50;33:51;"And yeah, why wouldn't I go?"
33:51;33:55;"- You know, I've always had like a funny connection in my head between"
33:55;33:59;"you as an iconic blonde Englishman living in LA,"
33:59;34:03;"with another iconic blonde Englishman living in LA, David Hockney."
34:03;34:04;"Did you guys ever hang out?"
34:04;34:06;"- Oh, no, we don't."
34:06;34:06;"We don't."
34:07;34:10;"Believe it or not, I've got a Hockney somewhere in this house."
34:10;34:11;"- Really?"
34:11;34:16;"- I went out with one of his best mates from Manchester, a girl called Jenny Rylance,"
34:16;34:19;"and he used to live upstairs when we were all unknown."
34:19;34:21;"- Oh, so you got some early work."
34:21;34:23;"- She came from Manchester as well."
34:23;34:26;"And I have a drawing of his somewhere, I've got to try and find it."
34:26;34:27;"Might be worth some money, you know."
34:27;34:29;"But I didn't really hang out with him."
34:29;34:30;"- But you met him?"
34:30;34:31;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34:31;34:35;"- And so there were a lot of English musicians of your generation,"
34:35;34:38;"probably all moving to LA around the same time, hanging out?"
34:38;34:41;"- Yeah, yeah, for the same reason, the tax reasons."
34:41;34:43;"I think the Bee Gees as well were living in England at that time,"
34:43;34:45;"and they moved out to California."
34:45;34:49;"May be wrong on that one, but there was a mass exodus."
34:49;34:51;"Because all of us thought, you know, how long is this going to last?"
34:51;34:54;"Didn't think I'd still be doing this in me 70s."
34:54;34:56;"We thought we'd go earn the money while we can, you know,"
34:56;34:58;"because what are we going to do with the rest of our lives?"
34:58;34:59;"- Yeah, of course."
34:59;35:02;"- So did you have those conversations with your friends when you were,"
35:02;35:06;"let's say, in your mid 30s and it's the early 80s or something,"
35:06;35:08;"and you're just, or the 70s, and you're like,"
35:08;35:11;"like in the year 2000, we'll definitely not be doing this anymore."
35:11;35:15;"I guess I'll, did you have a vision of what you might be doing"
35:15;35:17;"when you were in your 50s or 60s or 70s?"
35:17;35:18;"- No."
35:18;35:22;"- I've got no clue, it was frightening."
35:22;35:26;"I was put on this earth to just sing and look at this face."
35:26;35:28;"What else could I be but a rock singer?"
35:28;35:29;"(laughing)"
35:29;35:33;"- What would you tell the like 35 year old Rod Stewart"
35:33;35:34;"if you could talk to him now?"
35:34;35:37;"- My life's been pretty wonderful."
35:37;35:38;"I've got no complaints."
35:38;35:42;"I mean, I had a couple of dodgy business people working for me."
35:42;35:44;"Be careful of who you trust."
35:44;35:45;"Be careful."
35:45;35:47;"Always keep your eye on the pennies."
35:47;35:50;"You know, the pounds look after themselves."
35:50;35:51;"Keep your eye on the pennies."
35:51;35:53;"- Very good advice."
35:53;35:57;"And also like, the truth is, when we look backwards at your career,"
35:57;36:01;"it seems like a more or less unbroken string of successes,"
36:01;36:04;"which is not true of everybody from your generation."
36:04;36:08;"Like you had obviously like the early success in the rock era,"
36:08;36:12;"but late 70s, still making hits,"
36:12;36:16;"into the 80s, the new wave era, into the 90s."
36:16;36:17;"Is that how it felt at the time?"
36:17;36:19;"- Yeah, it did."
36:19;36:22;"You know, I think about it and I think, you know,"
36:22;36:27;"I'm still here and I've been hoping for a top five album tomorrow."
36:27;36:29;"I was hoping it was going to be number one,"
36:29;36:33;"but I can't compete with, I'm talking about in England, in Great Britain."
36:33;36:39;"Can't compete with Adele and ABBA and Little Ginger Geezer."
36:39;36:39;"- Oh yeah."
36:39;36:43;"- Yeah, Little Ginger Geezer."
36:43;36:45;"I can't compete with them."
36:45;36:48;"They're just, you know, ABBA haven't released an album for 40 years."
36:48;36:50;"But we're hoping to get in."
36:50;36:52;"So I would never have dreamt in a million years"
36:52;36:55;"I'd still be recording and more importantly,"
36:55;36:57;"enjoying it so much as I do."
36:57;36:59;"And I love getting up on the stage."
36:59;37:00;"I'm a natural show off."
37:00;37:03;"Always was before I was singing."
37:03;37:07;"You know, I love expressing myself with clothes and humor."
37:07;37:11;"Now I can do it with my voice that the good Lord has given me."
37:11;37:13;"- Yeah, your voice still sounds great."
37:13;37:14;"- It does, doesn't it?"
37:14;37:16;"- Yeah, no, no, no, truly."
37:16;37:18;"And I mean, did you do anything?"
37:18;37:21;"I mean, I know you did a lot of partying."
37:21;37:24;"So like, it's always just kind of sounded the same."
37:24;37:25;"You never had to sweat it."
37:25;37:28;"- Yeah, like an athlete, you know, as you get older,"
37:28;37:31;"you've got to look how there are only a couple of muscles"
37:31;37:32;"bashing together in your throat."
37:32;37:33;"You've got to look after them."
37:33;37:36;"You got, you know, you got to warm up for an hour,"
37:36;37:39;"warm down for 15 minutes."
37:39;37:42;"Can't stay out too late in noisy clubs anymore."
37:42;37:44;"You know, it's just because of getting older."
37:44;37:47;"And you got to look, it's like, it really is like being an athlete."
37:47;37:51;"Even when you do, you know, we did 10 concerts in Las Vegas."
37:51;37:53;"Takes a lot of building up to it."
37:53;37:55;"You know, you can't, it's like football."
37:55;37:56;"You can't just go out and play."
37:56;37:58;"You do all the training you want,"
37:58;38:01;"but you can't just get on the field and start playing."
38:01;38:02;"It's a whole different entity."
38:02;38:04;"Same with vocalizing."
38:04;38:06;"- Are you going on tour next year?"
38:06;38:08;"Are you mostly doing shows in Vegas?"
38:08;38:09;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
38:09;38:11;"And what happens, I do it three times a year."
38:11;38:14;"Beginning of the year, middle of the year, the end of the year."
38:14;38:16;"And in between that, hopefully if all goes well,"
38:16;38:19;"we'll be going down to New Zealand and Australia."
38:20;38:22;"And then we're doing three months in America."
38:22;38:26;"And then we'll do Europe and the UK this time next year."
38:26;38:28;"They're actually selling, in fact, a couple of gigs"
38:28;38:32;"are already sold out for this time next year here in England."
38:32;38:34;"So pretty good for an old fella."
38:34;38:36;"- Oh, amazing, awesome."
38:36;38:37;"That's incredible."

39:46;39:48;"- I have no idea if this is true,"
39:48;39:51;"but I heard a rumor that you're famously"
39:51;39:52;"a model train enthusiast,"
39:52;39:53;"and there have been times where you've taken"
39:53;39:56;"your set on tour."
39:56;39:56;"Is that true?"
39:56;39:58;"- Yeah, yeah, that's very, very true."
39:58;40:00;"- Oh, really?"
40:00;40:02;"- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?"
40:02;40:04;"- What is that you took it on tour?"
40:04;40:06;"- It just goes around in a circle, you know?"
40:06;40:08;"It's in a building here that's, I'd say,"
40:08;40:10;"45 feet by 30 feet."
40:10;40:13;"And I moved it over from America."
40:13;40:15;"It took three months to get in."
40:15;40:17;"It's gonna take about seven months"
40:17;40:20;"to get it up, working, and looking amazing."
40:20;40:21;"Look at it online."
40:21;40:22;"You won't believe it."
40:22;40:23;"You'd think it was the real thing."
40:23;40:25;"- Is the part that you've taken it on tour"
40:25;40:26;"with you true?"
40:26;40:27;"- Yes, it's very true, yeah."
40:27;40:30;"- So it sounds like it's, is it--"
40:30;40:31;"- Let me tell you, let me tell you."
40:31;40:32;"- You have to set it up."
40:32;40:33;"Yeah, break it down for us."
40:33;40:33;"- This is how it works."
40:33;40:34;"- Yeah."
40:34;40:35;"- I build a project."
40:35;40:37;"Say I've got a, you know, in my layout,"
40:37;40:39;"there's skyscrapers that are five foot tall,"
40:39;40:42;"in HO scale, to scale."
40:42;40:45;"So I would pack all my cases, paints,"
40:45;40:48;"carpentry, stool, everything that I need"
40:48;40:51;"in big cases and take it on tour."
40:51;40:54;"And the hotels would set up a room separately"
40:54;40:56;"with a dining table, right,"
40:56;40:59;"for me, especially to continue with my hobby."
40:59;41:01;"It is wonderful."
41:01;41:03;"You know, a lot of guys on tour,"
41:03;41:04;"they stay in bed all day,"
41:04;41:06;"or they're masturbating or whatever."
41:06;41:06;"(laughing)"
41:06;41:08;"Going out to the theater."
41:08;41:10;"Well, there's nothing wrong with that either,"
41:10;41:14;"but it's such a wonderful, a wonderful hobby."
41:14;41:16;"Three dimensional hobby, I love it."
41:16;41:17;"I work every day on it."
41:17;41:20;"- And so part of like the joy of doing it,"
41:20;41:22;"it's not merely, 'cause some people just collect,"
41:22;41:25;"but you like to actually put it together,"
41:25;41:26;"paint and really make it."
41:26;41:28;"- Build everything, yeah, build everything."
41:28;41:31;"Everything, the detail is ridiculous."
41:31;41:32;"I have a couple of girls work for me"
41:32;41:35;"who just put in blinds in windows."
41:35;41:35;"- Wow."
41:35;41:38;"- Skyscrapers, and there's thousands of them."
41:38;41:41;"And before that, they have to put the windows in,"
41:41;41:42;"little tiny windows."
41:42;41:44;"- There's pictures online of your whole setup?"
41:44;41:45;"- Yeah, yeah, look up, it's too small."
41:45;41:46;"- That the listeners can check out."
41:46;41:48;"- Yeah, you'll see it."
41:48;41:51;"- Have you traded notes with Neil Young?"
41:51;41:55;"- No, do you know, Neil is like what you said, my friend."
41:55;42:00;"He connects the rails up and he bought a big railroad company,"
42:00;42:02;"a toy company."
42:02;42:04;"What they call it, he bought it for his autistic son."
42:04;42:05;"- Lionel?"
42:05;42:06;"- Lionel, yeah."
42:06;42:08;"Yeah, so Lionel is more of a toy-like thing."
42:08;42:10;"You don't have to do anything,"
42:10;42:12;"just put the lines together and run the trains."
42:12;42:14;"It's a big difference between that"
42:14;42:15;"and scale model railroading."
42:15;42:17;"- I have a hot tip for you."
42:17;42:19;"If you're ever in Chicago,"
42:19;42:21;"have you been to the Art Institute of Chicago?"
42:21;42:22;"- Oh yeah, the layout there."
42:22;42:25;"- Well, in the bottom floor of that museum,"
42:25;42:27;"there's an incredible display of miniatures."
42:27;42:30;"- Yeah, yeah, I've been there."
42:30;42:30;"- Yeah."
42:30;42:31;"- They're in New York as well."
42:31;42:32;"- Incredible."
42:32;42:33;"- Yeah, I've heard about them."
42:33;42:34;"Well, I love Soul Street."
42:34;42:37;"Is it Soul Street?"
42:37;42:37;"Sal Street?"
42:37;42:38;"S-A-L-L-E?"
42:38;42:39;"- I don't know what it's called."
42:39;42:40;"I forget."
42:40;42:43;"It's someone that spent decades making these"
42:43;42:44;"and they're all on display"
42:44;42:48;"and they're just the most meticulous recreations of buildings"
42:48;42:49;"from different historical eras."
42:49;42:51;"- Oh God, I've got to see that."
42:51;42:52;"- I think you would love it."
42:52;42:53;"- What's it called?"
42:53;42:54;"Should I look it up?"
42:54;42:57;"- Well, it's at the Art Institute of Chicago."
42:57;42:58;"- Art Institute of Chicago."
42:58;42:59;"- Yeah, if you went there,"
42:59;43:01;"it would be in the bottom floor."
43:01;43:02;"- Well, I'll look at it online first."
43:02;43:04;"- And so when you're building this,"
43:04;43:07;"you're not building any city in particular."
43:07;43:11;"You're kind of, it's an imaginary city with buildings from all over the world?"
43:11;43:12;"- No, no, no."
43:12;43:15;"It's purely American railroads."
43:15;43:18;"The turn of the, about just after the war"
43:18;43:20;"when steam was being phased out"
43:20;43:22;"and diesel trains were coming in."
43:22;43:24;"And it's a cross between Chicago."
43:24;43:27;"You know, when I'm on tour, I'll take pictures of buildings"
43:27;43:29;"and say, right, I'm going to try and build something similar to that."
43:29;43:32;"So it's a cross between New York and Chicago."
43:32;43:34;"It's even got a little rubbish in the streets."
43:34;43:36;"- Whoa. And people?"
43:36;43:39;"- Oh yeah, thousands of them."
43:39;43:40;"- It's kind of like a work of art."
43:40;43:42;"- You could say that."
43:42;43:44;"Mine is considered up there amongst them."
43:44;43:45;"Get back to me."
43:45;43:46;"When you have a look at it,"
43:46;43:49;"then you'll understand how good it is."
43:49;43:51;"You know, it's hard for me to describe."
43:51;43:51;"- Right."
43:51;43:53;"- It gives me so much pleasure"
43:53;43:56;"and it's such an alternative to what I do for a living, you know?"
43:56;43:58;"- Right. Oh, it's amazing."
43:58;44:02;"- Roger Daltrey is also a model railroad man."
44:02;44:04;"Do you know a guy called Jules Holland?"
44:04;44:05;"- Oh yeah, of course. Yeah."
44:05;44:08;"- Jules Holland. He's as fanatical as me."
44:08;44:09;"- So you guys can trade notes?"
44:09;44:10;"- Yeah."
44:10;44:11;"- Amazing."
44:11;44:15;"- I love these classic rock icons who are into trains."
44:15;44:17;"Daltrey, Stewart, Neil Young."
44:17;44:20;"- Yeah. Roger is very much into it."
44:20;44:23;"But yeah, it's a wonderful hobby."
44:23;44:26;"- Do you go out of your way to ride trains when you travel?"
44:26;44:28;"- No, no, I don't go that far."
44:28;44:28;"- No?"
44:28;44:31;"- I don't do train spotting."
44:31;44:33;"- So the new album, like we were talking about,"
44:33;44:37;"you've always had this great knack for writing your own songs,"
44:37;44:38;"but also choosing well."
44:38;44:41;"The title track, Tears of Hercules."
44:41;44:43;"What's the story with the guy who wrote it?"
44:43;44:46;"He's somebody that you've dug into his work before, right?"
44:46;44:47;"- Mark Jordan."
44:47;44:47;"- Right."
44:47;44:50;"- He wrote a song for me called The Rhythm of My Heart"
44:50;44:51;"and we remained friends ever since."
44:51;44:51;"- Oh yeah, huge song."
44:51;44:55;"- Yeah, and he found that one of his."
44:55;44:58;"It's a gorgeous song and I love the title."
44:58;44:59;"And that's why, you know, they said,"
44:59;45:02;"""Well, why do you call it out in Tears of Hercules? Why not?"""
45:02;45:03;"It sucks you in straight away."
45:03;45:05;"What does he mean by that?"
45:05;45:08;"I mean, grown men who should be able to cry."
45:08;45:10;"- I was actually wondering about that"
45:10;45:13;"because it's a very evocative phrase."
45:13;45:16;"And as I was listening to the lyrics of the song,"
45:16;45:18;"it seems like it's about a guy"
45:18;45:20;"who's kind of walking through a city"
45:20;45:22;"and kind of reminiscing."
45:22;45:25;"And then he sees somebody that he used to love and says,"
45:25;45:27;"""Then I saw your face across the street"
45:27;45:28;"through the tears of Hercules."""
45:28;45:29;"- Yeah."
45:29;45:31;"- Your interpretation of that is that"
45:31;45:33;"it's like a strong man showing emotion."
45:33;45:34;"- Yeah, yeah."
45:34;45:36;"Now I don't know what, you know,"
45:36;45:38;"maybe I should ask Steve what he meant by it."
45:38;45:40;"But that's how I read it."
45:40;45:41;"People ask me."
45:41;45:42;"- No, it's cool."
45:42;45:43;"And of course, with lyrics,"
45:43;45:44;"there doesn't have to be an obvious answer."
45:44;45:45;"We just often go really deep"
45:45;45:47;"talking about lyrics on this show."
45:47;45:48;"I just wondered if maybe there was like a pub"
45:48;45:49;"called Tears of Hercules."
45:49;45:50;"I just, I'm just curious."
45:50;45:53;"- Oh, what a great name that would be."
45:54;45:54;"That would be fantastic."
45:54;45:56;"- Because English pubs have these crazy names."
45:56;45:57;"Like that wouldn't be that weird"
45:57;45:59;"to have an English pub called the Tears of Hercules."
45:59;46:02;"- Oh God, I feel like opening a pub now."
46:02;46:05;"That's the best idea I've heard today."
46:05;46:05;"- That'd be perfect."
46:05;46:06;"- Please do."
46:06;46:07;"- Yeah, because I thought maybe"
46:07;46:08;"the guy's walking down the street"
46:08;46:10;"and then he looks through the window of the pub,"
46:10;46:11;"the Tears of Hercules,"
46:11;46:13;"and he's, I can't believe it's my ex-girlfriend."
46:13;46:14;"Whoa."
46:14;46:15;"That's kind of how I interpret it."
46:15;46:16;"Anyway, just whatever."
46:16;46:18;"- No, that's the great,"
46:18;46:20;"that's the wonderful thing about songs."
46:20;46:22;"You can interpret it any way you wish."
46:22;46:23;"- Oh, absolutely."

48:01;48:04;"So has there been much music that,"
48:04;48:06;"because you have such a great ear for songs,"
48:06;48:10;"have you ever been tempted to record something"
48:10;48:12;"by a younger artist,"
48:12;48:14;"or are there any newer songwriters"
48:14;48:17;"that have kind of like caught your ear at all"
48:17;48:18;"as you've been looking for songs?"

48:21;48:23;"I like the way, I like his lyric writing."
48:23;48:25;"I like the way he presents himself."
48:25;48:26;"You know Bob Ezra?"

48:33;48:34;"- Yeah, yeah, I've heard of that."
48:34;48:35;"- Otherwise, no."
48:35;48:36;"- Understandable."
48:36;48:38;"Tell me if this line of reasoning,"
48:38;48:39;"if we've exhausted it,"
48:39;48:41;"but just back to the songwriting thing,"
48:41;48:43;"you have so many peers who,"
48:43;48:45;"you've written songs as good as anybody"
48:45;48:46;"of your generation,"
48:46;48:48;"but it seems like there's so many people"
48:48;48:50;"who get so caught up and competitive"
48:50;48:52;"about songwriting,"
48:52;48:54;"or people want to make an album"
48:54;48:56;"where they wrote every song themselves."
48:56;48:58;"Are you just like too cool to care?"
48:58;49:00;"You know, like you've always been,"
49:00;49:03;"you've never gotten caught up in that game?"
49:03;49:05;"- I'm unaware of any game about,"
49:05;49:08;"you know, you must do all your own songs or else."
49:08;49:10;"I mean, I just, as I always say,"
49:10;49:12;"I've got such a flexible voice."
49:12;49:14;"I can more or less sing anything, you know,"
49:14;49:17;"hence the great American songbook."
49:17;49:19;"So, but you know, you should record"
49:19;49:22;"what pleases you, what makes you happy."
49:22;49:25;"You know, I record what I think my fans want,"
49:25;49:28;"and what they want is what I want."
49:28;49:30;"I'm not going to try and, you know,"
49:30;49:32;"record half-bloody pop songs"
49:32;49:34;"just because it may be a hit."
49:34;49:35;"- Right."
49:35;49:36;"- Stick by your principles"
49:36;49:37;"and stick by what you believe."
49:37;49:38;"- Absolutely."
49:38;49:40;"I know you've talked about this at length"
49:40;49:42;"many times, including in your book,"
49:42;49:45;"but people often talk about a big moment"
49:45;49:48;"in your career is with the success of"
49:48;49:50;"""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"""
49:50;49:52;"There was also a kind of critical backlash"
49:52;49:53;"because they couldn't understand"
49:53;49:54;"why you're doing disco."
49:54;49:55;"I just want to say,"
49:55;49:57;"having revisited that song quite a bit"
49:57;49:59;"before the interview, I want to say"
49:59;50:01;"that song still goes very hard."
50:01;50:03;"It sounds great."
50:03;50:05;"What do you think was the big reaction to it"
50:05;50:06;"back then?"
50:06;50:08;"- Well, there was a big reaction"
50:08;50:10;"to all disco music after a while."
50:10;50:11;"I jumped on the bandwagon."
50:11;50:13;"I'll be totally square with you."
50:13;50:14;"I wanted to make a disco song."
50:14;50:16;"You know, I hate that word, disco."
50:16;50:18;"I wanted to make a dance record."
50:18;50:20;"I'd just come back from Brazil"
50:20;50:22;"and I heard this song in my head."
50:22;50:25;"(singing)"
50:25;50:28;"And turned it into a song six months later."
50:28;50:29;"Unfortunately, someone else"
50:29;50:31;"had already written that song,"
50:31;50:33;"so I was done for plaguism."
50:33;50:35;"(laughing)"
50:35;50:37;"It was a song by Ben Jorg."
50:37;50:38;"- Right, but so when you--"
50:38;50:40;"- I took the tribal and I heard it,"
50:40;50:42;"you know, and I went over it in my brain"
50:42;50:43;"and I turned it into a song."
50:43;50:45;"- And when you found out that you'd"
50:45;50:46;"subconsciously taken the melody,"
50:46;50:48;"you just, you said, ""Oh, no problem,"""
50:48;50:49;"and you just gave him some publishing?"
50:49;50:51;"- Hands up, take me to prison."
50:51;50:52;"Yeah, I wasn't going to try."
50:52;50:53;"I wouldn't have done it."
50:53;50:54;"(laughing)"
50:54;50:56;"You know, I think we both agreed."
50:56;50:58;"I said, ""Listen, I'll give you"
50:58;50:59;"""one of my songs on the album."
50:59;51:01;"""You can keep all the publishing,"
51:01;51:03;"""but we're going to give all the publishing"
51:03;51:05;"""of 'Do You Think I'm Sexy?' to UNICEF."""
51:05;51:07;"And he was great and he agreed."
51:07;51:10;"So every penny from that song"
51:10;51:11;"was going to UNICEF."
51:11;51:12;"- Oh, every penny?"
51:12;51:13;"- Yep."
51:13;51:14;"- Oh, wow."
51:14;51:15;"I'm sure that's made quite a bit."
51:17;51:29;"♪ Girl, you've got my body"
51:29;51:31;"♪ And you think I'm sexy"
51:31;51:34;"♪ Come on, shiver, let me know"
51:34;51:38;"♪ If you really need me"
51:38;51:40;"♪ Just reach out and touch me"
51:40;51:43;"♪ Come on, honey, tell me so"
51:43;51:45;"♪ Tell me so, baby ♪"
51:45;51:46;"- Obviously, that song was a huge hit,"
51:46;51:49;"so did the fact that a handful of critics"
51:49;51:51;"who wanted you to keep doing"
51:51;51:53;"every picture tells a story type music,"
51:53;51:54;"did it bother you or were you always"
51:54;51:56;"just having too much fun to care about"
51:56;51:57;"that kind of stuff?"
51:57;51:58;"- Yeah, it bothered me at the time."
51:58;52:00;"I mean, it wasn't just a few."
52:00;52:01;"It was every critic."
52:01;52:02;"Everyone hated it."
52:02;52:03;"The public loved it."
52:03;52:04;"But you know, you still,"
52:04;52:06;"it's nice to have the critics on your side."
52:06;52:08;"I mean, it was like walking around"
52:08;52:10;"with a pink lavatory seat over your head."
52:10;52:11;"(laughing)"
52:11;52:13;"It was just ridiculous."
52:13;52:15;"People loved it."
52:15;52:16;"You know, they absolutely,"
52:16;52:17;"they still love it."
52:17;52:18;"We closed the show with it"
52:18;52:20;"and it just brings back all the,"
52:20;52:21;"music is meant to do that."
52:21;52:25;"It's bringing back the memories of 1979,"
52:25;52:28;"you know, and that's what we're up there to do."
52:28;52:30;"Entertain people, send them all home happy."
52:30;52:31;"The problem I have,"
52:31;52:33;"and I think everybody has this problem,"
52:33;52:36;"trying to bring new songs into the act"
52:36;52:37;"when all they want to hear"
52:37;52:38;"is ""Tonight's the Night,"""
52:38;52:39;"""Hot Legs,"" ""Stay With Me,"""
52:39;52:41;"and ""Killing It, Georgie,"""
52:41;52:42;"and on and on and on."
52:42;52:43;"But I try."
52:43;52:45;"I say, ""Lisa, but please give this one"
52:45;52:46;"a big round of applause."
52:46;52:48;"It's a brand new song,"
52:48;52:49;"and this is what I'm going to say,"
52:49;52:51;"and it's called 'One More Time.'"""
52:51;52:52;"And they thought,"
52:52;52:54;"""God, give it a big round of applause."""
52:54;52:56;"- No, that's a great song."
52:56;52:57;"And how many,"
52:57;52:59;"so when you're planning like the new show,"
52:59;53:02;"how many songs do you think you can bring in"
53:02;53:03;"from the new record?"
53:03;53:05;"- Oh, I'll put two at the most."
53:05;53:06;"- Two at the most."
53:06;53:09;"- Two at the most, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:09;53:12;"'Cause it's a huge repertoire of songs."
53:12;53:14;"I mean, I could do three set lists,"
53:14;53:17;"and every song would be known, you know?"
53:17;53:18;"- Yeah."
53:18;53:19;"- It doesn't worry me."
53:19;53:21;"I mean, I just like getting up there and singing."
53:21;53:22;"It's been so long."
53:22;53:24;"It's been so long off."
53:24;53:25;"- Last question, guys."
53:25;53:26;"- Oh."
53:26;53:28;"- Yeah, I have to go train my football team."
53:28;53:29;"My under 10s."
53:29;53:31;"- Well, maybe just tell us about that."
53:31;53:32;"[laughs]"
53:32;53:35;"- Yeah, I coach an under 10s football team,"
53:35;53:37;"soccer team at my house here,"
53:37;53:39;"'cause I have an AstroTurf pitch and floodlights."
53:39;53:40;"- Oh, cool."
53:40;53:42;"- So we got training Wednesday night"
53:42;53:44;"with the boys' play on Sunday."
53:44;53:45;"It's my life."
53:45;53:47;"- And so you're actually like telling them"
53:47;53:49;"to run drills and pass them."
53:49;53:51;"- Yeah, that's what I was doing this morning"
53:51;53:55;"at 10 o'clock, running drills with a medicine ball."
53:55;53:57;"- And you've been playing soccer your whole life."
53:57;54:00;"And so you're still out there running around with the kids?"
54:00;54:02;"- Yeah, I can't play competitively anymore."
54:02;54:03;"Too many injuries."
54:03;54:05;"You know, I've got a knee replacement."
54:05;54:06;"I can still kick the ball."
54:06;54:07;"- Right."
54:07;54:10;"- But I can't get into a 50-50 tackle or anything."
54:10;54:11;"So I've got a knee replacement."
54:11;54:12;"- Okay, you know what?"
54:12;54:15;"I think just to end on the football/soccer note,"
54:15;54:19;"I imagine you being somebody who loves playing football,"
54:19;54:22;"living in L.A., a lot of British expats,"
54:22;54:24;"all sorts of people coming through."
54:24;54:26;"There must have been some legendary football matches"
54:26;54:28;"in L.A."
54:28;54:30;"Can you tell us about any of them?"
54:30;54:31;"- Oh, yeah."
54:31;54:34;"We formed an exiles, we called the exiles."
54:34;54:36;"And we're pretty well known around California"
54:36;54:38;"because we used to win all the cups."
54:38;54:40;"And actually got to the semifinals"
54:40;54:42;"of the national, U.S. National Cup."
54:42;54:44;"- Were there any other musicians in the mix?"
54:44;54:46;"- No, I don't think there was."
54:46;54:48;"No, can't think of any."
54:48;54:49;"Not at that level anyway."
54:49;54:51;"- Not Ron Wood?"
54:51;54:53;"- Well, he can't kick himself out of bed,"
54:53;54:55;"let alone a football."
54:55;54:57;"Or Elton John, or any of them, no."
54:57;55:00;"No, I can't think of anybody that was..."
55:00;55:01;"I'll tell you who's a good player,"
55:01;55:03;"although he's put on a bit of weight now."
55:03;55:04;"He's Robbie Williams."
55:04;55:07;"But he's done his back, he can't play anymore."
55:07;55:09;"But he was a really good player."
55:09;55:11;"- So you and Robbie Williams may be the only"
55:11;55:13;"true, actually good players"
55:13;55:15;"in the last 50 years of English music?"
55:15;55:17;"- No, I can't think..."
55:17;55:19;"You know, there's all the bands."
55:19;55:21;"There's a lot of bands can play."
55:21;55:23;"You know, they're all good, like Westlife."
55:23;55:25;"They're really good."
55:25;55:28;"Boys to Men, they've got some good footballers in there."
55:28;55:30;"- Really? Wow."
55:30;55:33;"But on the Exiles, these were people who had played"
55:33;55:36;"professionally or semi-professionally before?"
55:36;55:39;"- We had three players who were actually in the USA team"
55:39;55:41;"at that time, playing for us."
55:41;55:42;"- Wow."
55:42;55:43;"- It was such a great standard."
55:43;55:44;"- And then you."
55:44;55:45;"- And then me."
55:45;55:46;"- Yeah."
55:46;55:48;"- It's called the Exiles, the LA Exiles."
55:48;55:50;"You look up, they've got trains to look up,"
55:50;55:52;"and the LA Exiles."
55:52;55:55;"- And the new album, Tears of Hercules, your 31st album."
55:55;55:57;"Rod, it's been incredible having you on the show."
55:57;55:59;"Can't wait to go catch a show next year"
55:59;56:01;"when you're on the road."
56:01;56:02;"- Yeah."
56:02;56:04;"- And congratulations on the new album."
56:04;56:06;"- Take well, guys. Merry Christmas and happy New Year."
56:06;56:07;"- Great talking to you."
56:07;56:08;"- All right."
56:08;56:09;"- Merry Christmas."
56:09;56:10;"- Nice meeting you."
56:10;56:11;"- Have a good one."

57:28;57:29;"- Sir Rod."
57:29;57:32;"- Sir Rod. You had some great questions in there, Jake."
57:32;57:34;"- Well, so did you, bud."
57:34;57:35;"Tears of Hercules."
57:35;57:37;"- Tears of Hercules."
57:37;57:39;"I'm kind of glad that we started out"
57:39;57:42;"asking him about the Crypto.com arena"
57:42;57:44;"'cause that obviously set the tone."
57:44;57:45;"Who gives a shit?"
57:45;57:46;"- Exactly."
57:46;57:47;"- I don't give a fuck."
57:47;57:49;"'Cause actually, sometimes I think"
57:49;57:50;"when somebody comes on the show,"
57:50;57:52;"actually, a lot of the questions,"
57:52;57:53;"it's actually more just something"
57:53;57:54;"I want to talk about with you."
57:54;57:55;"You know, there's some questions"
57:55;57:56;"that are appropriate to ask the people,"
57:56;57:58;"and then there's some that's more just like"
57:58;58:00;"you and me just talking about music."
58:00;58:02;"'Cause really, as I prepared for the interview"
58:02;58:04;"and I was just kind of listening to his music,"
58:04;58:06;"it's like, I guess I already knew the answer."
58:06;58:09;"If you're Rod Stewart, you wrote ""Mandolin Wind."""
58:09;58:10;"Beautiful song."
58:10;58:12;"I know that's one of your favorites, Jake."
58:12;58:14;"- I wanted to ask him something about ""Mandolin Wind"""
58:14;58:16;"or who he co-wrote ""Maggie Mae"" with,"
58:16;58:18;"but it's sort of like, I just didn't get the sense."
58:18;58:20;"He'd be like, ""Yo, I wrote it."""
58:20;58:21;"- I read about that a little bit."
58:21;58:23;"The guy that he co-wrote ""Maggie Mae"""
58:23;58:25;"and ""You Wear It Well,"" two great songs."
58:25;58:27;"- Yeah, Martin Quinton."
58:27;58:29;"- And it kind of seems like,"
58:29;58:30;"I don't know exactly what happened,"
58:30;58:33;"but that guy apparently left music"
58:33;58:35;"and moved to a small town in Wales"
58:35;58:37;"and it says on Wikipedia"
58:37;58:39;"he suffered from mental health issues."
58:39;58:40;"I don't know what the story is,"
58:40;58:42;"but it's like, yeah, I don't know if we need to say it."
58:42;58:45;"And he died, if we just need to say Rod."
58:45;58:46;"What's that guy you co-wrote those songs with?"
58:46;58:49;"It sounded like the rest of his life was really weird."
58:49;58:50;"- I had that written down."
58:50;58:53;"I had, 'cause I've always wondered about that guy."
58:53;58:56;"And there's a great video on YouTube"
58:56;58:59;"of them playing ""You Wear It Well"" on top of the Pops."
58:59;59:03;"And it's all Rod Stewart and Ron Wood"
59:03;59:07;"in full '70s peak empire mode."
59:07;59:08;"And then there's this one guy"
59:08;59:10;"that looks like a librarian wearing a sweater"
59:10;59:12;"who's strumming-- - And that's Martin Quinton?"
59:12;59:13;"- And that's Martin, yeah."
59:13;59:15;"And I was like, what is the deal with it?"
59:15;59:17;"And then, yeah, it says on the Wikipedia page"
59:17;59:19;"that Rod asked him to join the Faces"
59:19;59:20;"and then he was like,"
59:20;59:23;"""I can't hang with this rock and roll lifestyle."""
59:23;59:24;"Anyway, I wanted to ask him about it,"
59:24;59:25;"but I'm also like,"
59:25;59:27;"it just didn't seem like it would go anywhere."
59:27;59:28;"I don't know."
59:28;59:30;"Or it seems sad or something, I don't know."
59:30;59:31;"- Yeah, yeah."
59:31;59:33;"But it is a fascinating story."
59:33;59:36;"Maybe we'll have to do some original research on our end."
59:36;59:37;"- I want to do."
59:37;59:40;"- But, yeah, but also, I do love these stories,"
59:40;59:42;"'cause I can picture it two ways."
59:42;59:47;"Either you're somebody who was kind of heading somewhere"
59:47;59:50;"in music and then something derails you,"
59:50;59:52;"a personal issue or something,"
59:52;59:54;"and then you go live in a small town"
59:54;59:55;"and then you're just like,"
59:55;59:57;"next thing you know, it's 20 years later"
59:57;59:59;"and it's like Rod Stewart just touring stadiums"
59:59;01:00:00;"and you're just like,"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"""Whoa, man, what went wrong?"""
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Or the flip side is actually very cool."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You're somebody who just enjoys a quiet life."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"You got a farm in Wales and people are like,"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"""Hey, man, so what's your deal?"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"""Do you have a job?"""
01:00:11;01:00:12;"And you're like,"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"""Oh, it's funny you should ask."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"""I co-wrote Maggie Mae and You Wear It Well"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"""in the early '70s,"
01:00:16;01:00:21;"""and I make minimum 200,000 pounds a year off that,"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"""and I just (beep) chill."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"""I take long walks."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"""I was never one for the rock and roll lifestyle."

01:00:29;01:00:30;"""but you know what?"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"""It's not bad, huh?"""
01:00:31;01:00:32;"And they're like,"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"""You know, that is pretty cool."""
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- Yeah."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- And I guess this question"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"that I kept trying to get to with him is,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"and I think I already knew the answer,"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"is that, so you're this dude, Rod Stewart,"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"you've written hit songs,"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"and you've written deeply moving songs"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"like Mandolin Wind."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"There's this lines in it where it's like,"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"""I felt ashamed,"""
01:00:48;01:00:52;"just deep emotional music about memory"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"and love and all the classic themes of great music,"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"and then you kind of look,"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"and you're like,"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"""But then this guy just, you know,"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"""he would cover all these other songs,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"""and he never really wrote more"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"""than two or three songs per album,"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"""and sometimes barely any."""
01:01:07;01:01:08;"So yeah, what's the story with that?"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"And I think obviously the story is,"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"he didn't give a (beep)."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"- Yeah."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- He's cool."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"He didn't feel the need to be like,"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"you could picture another guy--"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"- A precious artist, right."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"- Yeah, who would have been in the mid '90s,"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"would have been like,"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"""I'm gonna make my Harvest Moon."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"""I'm gonna do a Back to Basics album."

01:01:28;01:01:29;"Because you know what,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"it still (beep) bugs me that the critics (beep) on,"

01:01:32;01:01:35;"You wanna see Rod get into his mandolin mode,"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"here you go."
01:01:36;01:01:41;"10 songs of pure, rootsy, Celtic Americana"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"from Rod Stewart."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"I wrote all the (beep) songs."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"Jeff Beck's out here playing guitar."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"But the truth is, he doesn't need to."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- He already did it."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- Yeah, and also,"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"I was thinking about that too,"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"that era, he was so prolific."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"He's putting out one solo record"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"and one Faces record a year."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"Between the late '60s into the mid '70s"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"when his career shifted,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"he's co-writing with people."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"There's other songwriters on the Faces records."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Yeah."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- He's a front man."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"He said so in the interviews,"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"he's like, ""Listen, even before I started singing,"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"""I've been a showman."""
01:02:14;01:02:17;"So I think maybe he wasn't burdened"
01:02:17;01:02:21;"with this psychology of being an important artist"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"with a capital A."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"- He basically had unbroken decades of success."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"He was having platinum albums in the early 2000s"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"when he was covering show tunes."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- The songbook, right."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"- In the Great American Songbook."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"So you could imagine him looking at the Rolling Stones."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"You could picture another person"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"looking at the Rolling Stones,"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"a guy who came from that milieu"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"but then went a little pop."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"You could picture somebody looking at the Stones"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"and be like, ""They're a cool rock band,"" whatever."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"But you could picture Rod Stewart"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"probably looking at the Stones in the early '80s"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"and just be like, ""Tough luck, fellas."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"""I'm selling a lot more records than you."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"""And you know what?"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"""I don't have to split it five ways."""
01:02:58;01:02:59;"You know what I mean?"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"- Footloose and fancy free."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"- Just killing it."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"And his '80s work is great too."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Actually, one of the first Rod Stewart songs"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"I really loved is Young Turks."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"It's like new wave songs."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"And truly, like he said,"
01:03:11;01:03:15;"he's actually, I don't want to gush about him too much"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"and knock it in his motor."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Like, ""Yeah, you know,"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"""we talked to him for 35 minutes once."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"""He's actually a very humble guy."""
01:03:20;01:03:22;"But even with that interview aside,"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"I always got this vibe from him that he is like,"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"he's kind of like, ""Oh, I got a great instrument."

01:03:31;01:03:32;"Just like, I love that."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Just like showbiz vibe."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"- Yeah."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"- I did the Faces stuff,"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"dropped some disco, got into new wave."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"You know what?"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"I just (beep) sounded good on all these records."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Thank you."

01:03:43;01:03:44;"Like."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- I know, I thought maybe at the end"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"about asking him about Forever Young,"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"which is another great '80s number."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"- And another subconscious plagiarization."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"- I mean, well, Forever Young"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"is such an iconic Bob Dylan song."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Obviously, like,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"it couldn't have been that subconscious."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"I was just curious about the origin of that song."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Right."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"But it's funny 'cause it's not exactly a cover."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"It's like he took the lyrical conceit"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"of Bob Dylan's Forever Young."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"- Totally different music."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"- Applied it to a new, catchier song."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"I mean, obviously more of like a hit song."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Yeah, I also love that vibe."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"And actually, I love the vibe too"

01:06:29;01:06:32;"you still had like the warmth of the '60s,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"but the recording quality was slightly better,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"but it hadn't turned the corner yet"

01:06:49;01:06:51;"if you were a band in 1971,"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"I think you have the highest odds"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"of making like a good sounding record."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- Yeah. - Like compared to any other era."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- I love that there's this kind of,"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"his early work,"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"whether the songs that he wrote"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"or songs that he chose,"

01:07:09;01:07:13;"they have this like deep kind of like sepia tone nostalgia."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"And it's funny, like he almost presented himself"
01:07:16;01:07:20;"in those years as like a rumpled old raincoat or something,"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"just like, ""Oh, I'm Rod Stewart."""
01:07:21;01:07:24;"Like almost like a man out of time."
01:07:24;01:07:27;"Like, you know, a guy with like this deep,"
01:07:27;01:07:31;"sentimental nostalgia for like the old times."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"But then at the same time,"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"he very easily transitioned into like"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"being like a '70s sexy fashion icon too,"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"like very cutting edge."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"He's an interesting mix."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"- Yeah, I mean, I think he's a bit of a chameleon."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"'Cause I think in the early '70s,"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"that's what was fashionable."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"- Right, right, right."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"- Rootsy kind of country rock, you know,"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"influenced by like the band."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"- And Crosby, Stills, and Nash,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"he was probably like, ""Oh yeah, that's a good vibe."""
01:07:55;01:07:57;"- Yeah, and I think like he and his buddies were into that"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"and that's what the faces sounded like."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"That's what those solo records sounded like."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"And then he definitely moved"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"in a way that's kind of unusual"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"for how successful he was for so many decades."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"He moved with the times."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- You know who I'm kind of realizing"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"might be the Rod Stewart of our day?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"- Hmm."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"- Anybody want to guess?"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"- Solo artist?"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"- Solo artist, yeah."
01:08:17;01:08:18;"Not that ginger bloke."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- I love that."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- No."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Sam Hunt?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- No."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"- I don't know."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"- The person I'm thinking of is actually The Weeknd."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"Because--"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"- Okay."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"- You know, hear me out."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"Because if the early Rod Stewart"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"was kind of like the critics loved it"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"and it was kind of had this like nostalgia"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"that was fashionable then."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"When The Weeknd first came out"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"and he was doing like the kind of like hazy,"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"weird, beach house sampling R&B"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"and everybody's like, ""Whoa!"""
01:08:46;01:08:50;"He kind of came out in the same era as like Chillwave."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Not that he was a Chillwave artist,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"but it was this era where there was like this type of nostalgia"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"for kind of like woozy sounds and recontextualized stuff."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"And The Weeknd, like, you know,"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"those early EPs, like critics loved them."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"They were like super cool."
01:09:03;01:09:07;"And then he kind of just like kept going"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"and just got bigger and bigger."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"He did like that song from Fifty Shades of Grey"
01:09:11;01:09:15;"that's like a kind of like a throwback orchestral song."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"He's kind of in his like new wave era,"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"just like a pure pop star."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"I could picture him like in 30 years"
01:09:21;01:09:25;"coming on a Time Crisis, Time Crisis Junior,"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"when me and Jake hang it up."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"And somebody being like, ""Yeah, like, so, you know,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"when you came out, you were kind of like seen as almost like"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"like this hipster thing."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"It's funny to think that you were like this hipster,"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"like critic thing."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"And then you went on to be this like huge pop star."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"And like The Weeknd's just like,"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I don't even know who his peers would be,"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"but he would just be like, ""Yeah, I mean,"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"my voice sounds great on everything."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"I have a very flexible, durable voice."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Been there, done that with like the hipster sh*t."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"I make hits and I have a great time."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"You think I give a sh*t about that, like,"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"hipster runoff stuff?"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Like what the f*ck are you talking about?"""
01:09:54;01:09:56;"You know, just like, ""Yeah, I have a good time."""
01:09:56;01:09:58;"And I bet he probably plays soccer too."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"And he'll probably end up doing a Vegas residency."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"Oh yeah, probably a bit sooner."
01:10:03;01:10:06;"Now you can do that much sooner in your career."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Yeah, you could totally see like The Weeknd."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"I mean, you know, obviously we're in this weird"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"end of history phase where people keep returning"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"to the same things, but like in 10 years,"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"if like The Weeknd dropped an album"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"doing like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett type songs,"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"and that was like a huge hit,"

01:11:32;01:11:35;"I wonder if Rod Stewart knows anything about The Weeknd."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"He seems like pretty happy just to do his thing."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Yeah."
01:11:39;01:11:40;"That's also kind of what I figured too,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"is like I had a feeling too,"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"even just asking him about new artists,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"the most likely thing is that he's gonna be like,"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"""I don't really give a (beep)."""
01:11:47;01:11:48;"You know, like what are you?"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"It would have been funny if we were like,"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"""Rod, but do you know what crypto is?"""
01:11:53;01:11:55;"Yeah."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"That's for the next time."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Also, it crossed my mind too,"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"that we could just like make a list and just be like,"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"""All right, Rod, we're gonna name like 10 things."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Do you know what they are?"""
01:12:04;01:12:06;"But that might come across as like condescending,"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"but I should be like guided by voices."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"No, absolutely not."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"I think the truth is you should just be like,"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"""No, what is this guys?"""
01:12:14;01:12:15;"Like..."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"I thought maybe if there was the right time to be like,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"""What do you think of punk rock when that came out?"""
01:12:20;01:12:21;"'Cause he would obviously know."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Yes, that's a good question."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"You know, but you know."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"But even that's probably like a question"
01:12:26;01:12:27;"that he's probably answered."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"So like he..."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"He'd probably be like, ""Yeah."""
01:12:29;01:12:30;"He probably has a stock answer."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Yeah, that's what I..."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"Like where he's probably like,"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"I mean, I can start people like,"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"""Love the energy, but you know, it's just rock and roll."""
01:12:37;01:12:38;"That's what so many of those dudes say."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"It was, you know, it's just rock and roll."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"They're just playing punk rock, man."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"(laughs)"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"Rod, what'd you think of Oasis in the 90s?"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"Yeah."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"Oh yeah."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"Great group, fun lads, some really good songs."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Like..."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Yeah."
01:12:55;01:12:56;"Cool."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Next question."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"(laughs)"
01:12:59;01:13:03;"And actually, I don't see Rod Stewart covering like Wonderwall."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"No."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"He probably could, but anyway,"
01:13:07;01:13:11;"we could go on and on about the legend that is Rod Stewart."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"So Jay, you got a pretty tight email."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"Do you still get the occasional TC email?"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Yeah, years ago on the show,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"when people started emailing us,"
01:13:20;01:13:24;"they found my email and would just email me."
01:13:24;01:13:28;"And then Seinfeld started the official TC account."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"But I do get the straight email."
01:13:30;01:13:34;"And we got an email from a dude that's been listening."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"He's living in the past."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"He's been listening to the show from episode one,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"which was in 2015."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Oh yeah, it's amazing that people do that."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"That's like..."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"That's really weird."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"I can't even imagine what that would be like,"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"but it's not the first time I've heard about somebody doing that."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"I mean, we're really getting..."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Because what episode are we on right now?"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"161."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Oh my God."
01:13:56;01:14:00;"To start Time Crisis from the top is like next level."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"It's a huge time commitment."
01:14:02;01:14:05;"And shout out to anybody who does that, because that's deep."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"But why don't we just read the email?"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Jake, you want to read it?"
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Yeah, yeah."
01:14:09;01:14:12;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Time Crisis crew."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"""I'm a 42-year-old guy living in Memphis, Tennessee."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"I rarely listen to any new music outside of a handful of bands,"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"one of which is VW."""
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Hell yeah."
01:14:23;01:14:28;"""I actually heard about VW's first album in the nerdiest old guy way possible"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"from an album review on NPR."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"Only got to see them once in concert in Nashville a couple years ago,"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"and it was great."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"About six months ago, I heard about Time Crisis."
01:14:37;01:14:41;"I wasn't sure if it was something I would be interested in,"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"but as I scrolled through the episodes,"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"I saw a lot of mentions of The Grateful Dead."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"As a longtime Deadhead, I was stoked about that."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"And I listened to the Bob Weir interview and really liked the show."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"I decided to go back and start on the first episode."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"I usually listen to about two or three episodes per week."""
01:14:56;01:14:59;"So he's doing four to six hours a week, folks."
01:14:59;01:15:03;"And it's crazy to hear you guys talking about things"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"that you don't know about yet,"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"especially when you guys thought Trump even entering the presidential race"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"was a joke."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Oops."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"I mean, it's not a joke, guys."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"He's going to win."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And I'm on about episode 60 right now,"
01:15:16;01:15:20;"so you guys are completely clueless that three years away is COVID."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"""I'm about the same age as Jake, and we have very similar tastes in music."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"And I think, like Jake, if it wasn't for Time Crisis and maybe Uber rides,"
01:15:28;01:15:32;"we would not hear any of the music from the top five."
01:15:32;01:15:35;"But I did want to get your take on something."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"When you guys do comparisons with the top fives from the '60s, '70s,"
01:15:38;01:15:42;"and even '80s, I know probably 90% of the songs."
01:15:42;01:15:46;"Do you guys think that 30, 40, 50 years from now,"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"people will still know all the top five songs from this era?"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"The Chainsmokers, Ed Sheeran, etc.?"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"My guess, no way."""
01:15:53;01:15:55;"I disagree, but yeah."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"You disagree?"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"I think people will still--"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"I mean, when songs are hits,"
01:16:00;01:16:04;"they usually have a better chance of lasting."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"I mean, we're going to remember some music from this era,"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"or maybe we won't."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"I don't know."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"I can't tell."
01:16:09;01:16:13;"I mean, lately, I used to always kind of take the point of view,"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"""We celebrate this music from the '60s."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"It's important."""
01:16:16;01:16:20;"But again, that's because we grew up in the '90s,"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"so that was like 30 years earlier,"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"and it held this kind of importance."
01:16:25;01:16:28;"But as time goes on, people will look back to different eras,"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"and that partially happened."
01:16:29;01:16:33;"In the 2000s, I think the '80s took on more significance."
01:16:33;01:16:36;"In the '90s, they were kind of looked down on."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"And then suddenly people are like,"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"""No, the '80s is actually almost as important as the '60s"
01:16:40;01:16:45;"in terms of new ideas and important artists and new archetypes."""
01:16:45;01:16:47;"So, you know, I can see it both ways."
01:16:47;01:16:51;"But I will say as I get older and I watch more come and go,"
01:16:51;01:16:56;"I do think there is something uniquely durable about the '60s."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"Maybe it's because we've seen how the '60s artists"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"didn't really get replaced by anybody from the '90s."
01:17:04;01:17:08;"Like, the Rolling Stones are like a bigger touring act"
01:17:08;01:17:12;"than basically any band from the '90s or the 2000s."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"And like the cultural hold of the Beatles,"
01:17:15;01:17:20;"I went to a screening of a preview of that Get Back, by the way."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"I'm very psyched to see that."
01:17:21;01:17:25;"It's so deep to see them in the studio and just horsing around."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"And it's pretty wild."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"But even just watching that,"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"there's just something about the Beatles still--"
01:17:32;01:17:37;"it does seem like the Beatles will always have this kind of stranglehold"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"that'll never go away, which maybe seems obvious."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"And people are like, ""Yeah, no, s*** the Beatles."""
01:17:42;01:17:45;"But again, picture Rod Stewart in the mid '70s being like,"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"""S***, I got to make some money because who the f*** knows where I'm going to be."""
01:17:48;01:17:51;"He's probably thinking, ""Imagine the year 1992."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"Jesus Christ, I could be a f***ing bum on the street of, you know--"""
01:17:56;01:17:59;"""I'm going to be coaching football at a community college."""
01:17:59;01:18:01;"""On Mars."""

01:18:02;01:18:05;"""1992? Can you imagine?"""
01:18:05;01:18:07;"""1992, God."""
01:18:07;01:18:11;"""Yeah, I'll probably be on a spaceship singing with a jazz band."""
01:18:11;01:18:14;"But anyway, yeah, it was hard to picture what might exist."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"So you could also imagine that in the '90s, people were like,"
01:18:17;01:18:21;"""Mom and Dad, you guys have the Beatles. We have Oasis and Blur."""
01:18:21;01:18:23;"""What's the difference?"""
01:18:23;01:18:28;"""And then our kids, they'll have Oasis and Blur. We'll be there, the Beatles."""
01:18:28;01:18:34;"""And then an as-yet-unknown band will be their Oasis."""
01:18:34;01:18:36;"""And so it goes."""
01:18:36;01:18:39;"It wouldn't be crazy that somebody might think that."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"I think a lot of people assume that."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"That generation does have a stranglehold."
01:18:43;01:18:46;"They outlasted the pretenders to the throne."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"Which is not to say that nobody had success or anything,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"but it's not linear or something."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"It's not like they got bumped down a few pegs,"
01:18:53;01:18:59;"and then we got Nirvana and Mudhoney or whatever."
01:18:59;01:19:03;"Truly, those bands loom large."
01:19:03;01:19:07;"So anyway, that's all to say that I don't think it's that crazy to imagine"
01:19:07;01:19:14;"that there might be songs from the '70s that still cast a longer shadow"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"than stuff from the past 10 years."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"Of course, there's always going to be generational nostalgia,"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"but we're just entering this weird phase."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"I don't know how to describe it."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"I guess all I'm saying is we just don't know."
01:19:24;01:19:28;"There's a lyric--I'm going to quote my own lyrics."
01:19:28;01:19:32;"There's a lyric on the latest Mountain Brews EP that goes,"
01:19:32;01:19:36;"""The '70s, '80s, and '90s, they came to an end."
01:19:36;01:19:39;"For 20 years it's been a blur, sliding downhill, my friend."""
01:19:39;01:19:42;"Now that could apply to a lot of things,"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"but I think it definitely applies to the conversation we're having now."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"And I think a lot of it has to do with--we've talked about this."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"This is classic TC."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"I mean, in the '60s and '70s, the art form was new."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"It was a fresh art form."
01:19:55;01:20:01;"A lot of the basic big ideas that have been regurgitated in rock"
01:20:01;01:20:07;"the last 40 years were explored between the late '50s and the late '70s."
01:20:07;01:20:12;"From Elvis to punk, that 20-year run,"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"most of the idea--in terms of rock music,"
01:20:15;01:20:19;"most of the ideas that we are still contending with were explored first then"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"in that 20-year run."
01:20:21;01:20:24;"And after that, yeah, it's going to be diminishing returns."
01:20:24;01:20:27;"Honestly, even when you get to dance music and hip-hop,"
01:20:27;01:20:32;"you can make a pretty strong case for some significant ideas"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"being established by the '90s."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"It doesn't mean that there's actually nothing new under the sun,"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"but it just means that that era will always have this type of--"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"it's going to loom large."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"The empire."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"Hide of the empire."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Anyway, back to the email."
01:20:48;01:20:51;"The other thing I love about the show is that Jake is honest with his opinions"
01:20:51;01:20:55;"of this new music, and nearly 100% of the time I agree with him"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"when he says something sucks."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"I think I used to be--because he's listening to older episodes--"
01:20:59;01:21:02;"I think I used to be a little more dismissive and harsh."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"I think I've mellowed in my old age."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"[laughter]"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"I really wish I was in the studio with you guys so I could hear Ezra's real opinion"
01:21:10;01:21:14;"when the mics are off, because he never says anything sucks."
01:21:14;01:21:17;"But as a music industry professional, he's probably scared he will run into"
01:21:17;01:21:21;"one of those guys at a music industry professional event."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Understandable."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Thanks for understanding."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"I feel like you've become a little more candid, maybe."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"Yeah, maybe a touch more."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Yeah, I think you have."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"Also, I know Jake is a big fan of corporations."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"[laughter]"
01:21:35;01:21:39;"That is a very oblique, weird statement, but let's just--"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"let's just take that for what it is."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"Jake's a fan of corporations."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"Large and small."
01:21:45;01:21:48;"I've always worked at small companies, but for the last 10 years,"
01:21:48;01:21:53;"I've worked as an executive at a large, publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"That's a big shot."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"Yeah."
01:21:55;01:22:00;"That sounds like a big deal--executive at a large, publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"I wonder where he works."
01:22:02;01:22:05;"I thought it was going to be terrible when I started it,"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"but it has actually been great."
01:22:06;01:22:09;"At the end of the day, even the largest companies are comprised of people,"
01:22:09;01:22:12;"and if the majority of the people are good people,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"it ends up being a great place to work."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"Well, that's heartwarming, considering we are being broadcast"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"on one of the largest corporations' platforms."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Yeah, but the only thing--"
01:22:22;01:22:25;"Apple is definitely a publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"I guess the only question is--"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"[laughter]"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"--are we--"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"This could be a psy-op."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"--are we executives?"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Technically speaking--"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Wait, Seinfeld, can I get a number cruncher?"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Me and Jake are technically Apple executives."
01:22:36;01:22:40;"Now, now, now, now, now, now, let's get a number crunch."
01:22:40;01:22:43;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"Yeah, you definitely are in the C-suite."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"You're Apple executives via Time Crisis,"
01:22:48;01:22:52;"and I congratulate you on years of executive service."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"Because we're president and vice president of Time Crisis,"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"which is an Apple company."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"So, all right."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"But also, I feel this point too."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Increasingly as I've gotten older, too,"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I've kind of felt like the--"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"You can't put the genie back in the bottle."
01:23:07;01:23:09;"Can't step in the same river twice."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"The world changes."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"It's not hard to make a case that it's changing for the worse."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Of course, I'm sympathetic to that interpretation"
01:23:16;01:23:20;"of the flow of history and culture."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"But truly, whenever you get dropped into history,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"certainly the last--"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"Let's say the last few thousand years of human history,"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"there's going to be all sorts of weird things"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"and things seemingly trending in the wrong direction"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"and some weird mix of living in a golden age"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"and also a dark age."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"And I think he's right."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"It's an important skill to have"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"to be able to look around and say, ""You know what?"
01:23:42;01:23:46;"I may be under some nasty fluorescent lights."
01:23:46;01:23:52;"I may be in some weird kind of soul-crushing environment."""
01:23:52;01:23:54;"And yet, never forget,"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"as long as you're around other human beings,"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"there is something you can unlock in yourself"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"or whatever, I guess you call your humanity,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"and be like, ""You know what? It's all good."""
01:24:04;01:24:06;"I always think we've all been in these positions,"
01:24:06;01:24:07;"being at an airport."
01:24:07;01:24:10;"What's worse than a big airport?"
01:24:10;01:24:14;"Truly, that's the epitome of soulless,"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"modern life sucking."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"And yet, if you're with a group of people,"
01:24:18;01:24:23;"it smells weird sitting in a nasty chair by the gate."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"But if you're with a bunch of people that you like,"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"your family, friends, whatever, you have a laugh,"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"it goes by in a flash."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"It's people, folks."
01:24:30;01:24:33;"Plus, you're like, ""I'm enduring this airport hang,"
01:24:33;01:24:36;"but I'm going to be 3,000 miles away in six hours."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"How crazy is that?"""
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Yeah."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"I definitely do that."
01:24:40;01:24:41;"Focus on the positives."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"That you focus on the positive."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"Yeah."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Well, I definitely am like,"

01:24:49;01:24:50;"That's right."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"Very basic statement."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"That's beautiful."

01:25:31;01:25:32;"First of all, roofing..."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"I'm surprised there's a roofing industry company"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"that's in the Fortune 500."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"It must be like a..."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"It must sell shingles."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"It must be some giant..."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Yeah, or it's just like such a giant company."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Wait, I think I got it."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Yeah."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"I think I found it."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Well, don't dox him."

01:25:55;01:25:56;"It has roofing in the name."

01:26:24;01:26:25;"Have you ever been to f***ing Disney World?"
01:26:25;01:26:29;"You know how many f***ing roofs they have to build globally per annum?"

01:26:30;01:26:31;"Cruise liners have roofs too."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Never thought about that."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"That's right."
01:26:34;01:26:37;"I mean, Walt Disney actually personally started the roofing division"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"because when Disneyland was built in the '50s,"
01:26:40;01:26:43;"I mean, the suburban explosion in Orange County"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"was incredible at that point."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"And he saw an opportunity."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"He didn't slap the Disney sticker on it, but..."
01:26:50;01:26:53;"Oh, and by the way, you know who builds roofs for Netflix?"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"It's Disney."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"You think Disney gives a s*** about the streaming wars?"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"It doesn't matter who wins."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"They're building the roofs."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Oh, my God."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"I didn't realize that."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Well, what, you think they made all that money off cartoons?"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Dumbass."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"All right, man."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"I get it."
01:27:08;01:27:14;"I see a mansard roof through the trees."
01:27:14;01:27:19;"I see a salty message written in the eaves."
01:27:19;01:27:25;"The ground beneath my feet, the art garbage and concrete."
01:27:25;01:27:29;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too."

01:27:54;01:27:58;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too."
01:27:58;01:28:03;"But also, this idea of an internal only podcast for our sales team,"
01:28:03;01:28:07;"that's like how many people could possibly be at the sales team"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"of, I guess, the big company?"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"A couple hundred?"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"Two hundred? I feel like probably under a thousand."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"I mean, I guess that's just like, that's the, you know,"
01:28:16;01:28:20;"back in the day people used to make like a newsletter for like a tiny company."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"Or it's almost just like doing like college radio."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Yeah, we got about 11 people listening."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"All right."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"That's the audience."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"It's 11 people."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Cool."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Call in."
01:28:30;01:28:34;"You know how like record collectors, especially in the 21st century,"
01:28:34;01:28:38;"have gotten really into digging into the past for private press recordings?"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"Yeah, yeah."
01:28:39;01:28:43;"Like, Jake, you've gotten into some like private press new age music?"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"I love hitting the bins in SoCal."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"There's so many weird--"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Self-release."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"Yeah, self-release private press new age records"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"that were put out in California in the '70s and early '80s."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"Maybe in the future it'll be like this thing where,"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"I guess you'd have to be a historian or just like a podcast obsessive,"
01:29:02;01:29:06;"this being like, yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody's listening to Joe Rogan"
01:29:06;01:29:09;"or whatever, but I actually have very particular tastes."
01:29:09;01:29:14;"And I scour the internet trying to find internal only podcasts."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"And it's actually so amazing."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"You just [BLEEP] throw that on in your pod and just vibe out."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"It's like you're there in 2021."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"I found this one."
01:29:23;01:29:24;"It was so weird."
01:29:24;01:29:27;"It was for the sales team of a roofing company."
01:29:27;01:29:28;"And they made a podcast for it."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"And I was listening to that."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"It's like, whoa, [BLEEP] glass from the past, man."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"It's like you're there."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"It's crazy."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"Yeah, there's a Reddit forum with the passwords"
01:29:37;01:29:42;"to all of these weird internal corporate podcasts."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"Somehow, I don't even know how to tie that to NFTs,"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"but I'm sure there's a way."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"All right, let's get into the top five."
01:29:50;01:29:56;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"We're doing 1969 versus 2021."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"Why 1969?"
01:30:01;01:30:07;"Because that's the year that Rod Stewart dropped his first solo album."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"The number five song--"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"I'm curious."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"I don't know this artist."

01:30:15;01:30:17;"Oh, I love this song."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"I wonder if I'll recognize it."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"Oh, it's a weird version."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Oh, really?"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"Yeah."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"It's a weird rerecord."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Jake's got a real ear for those rerecords."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:30:30;01:30:34;"I was trying to get into my Once Upon a Time in Hollywood mindset"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"because it's the perfect kind of song"
01:30:36;01:30:41;"that could have been innocuously in the background of one of those scenes."
01:30:41;01:30:45;"I was like, ""Oh, that's-- Here we go."""
01:30:45;01:30:46;"Oh, it's slower."
01:30:46;01:30:51;"I like the ear check."
01:30:51;01:30:56;"The Flying Machine, we're from rugby in England."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"This sounds weird, too, but whatever."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Is this a cover?"
01:31:00;01:31:03;"Apparently, there are like 10 versions of this song on Apple Music"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"and under-labeled."
01:31:06;01:31:13;"Yeah, this is not the definitive version either, but that's okay."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"They keep getting slower."
01:31:14;01:31:23;"Oh, this sounds more '60s."
01:31:23;01:31:31;"This is slowed down."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"This is not the definitive version?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"God, did someone dose my coffee?"
01:31:35;01:31:39;"I'm like, ""What is happening?"""
01:31:39;01:31:42;"Every version has gotten slower and in a lower key."
01:31:42;01:31:52;"Right."
01:31:52;01:31:57;"Classic kind of '60s, unique woman's name."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"Smile, little smile for me, Rosemary."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"It's kind of also like, ""Just walk away, Renee."""
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Yeah."
01:32:03;01:32:06;"All right, I get the idea."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"Weird how slow that is."

01:52:07;01:52:10;"When my wife's father"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"has introduced me to Stokies,"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"what is she gonna say?"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"She's not gonna say my father made a mistake,"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"because her father never makes a mistake."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"So therefore, it is okay."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"I can smoke Stokies around her."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"I can smoke Stokies in my house."
01:52:24;01:52:28;"First of all, because her father introduced me to Stokies."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"And second of all, because I'm a stud."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"I'm ballsy."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"I don't take no [bleep] from anyone."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"I smoke my Stokies anywhere I want."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"I don't have to find a hideout place like you."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"[laughter]"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"That is..."
01:52:43;01:52:44;"I mean..."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"The governor, man. I mean..."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Unreal."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"I forgot that he kept saying Stokies."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"I don't have to find a hideout like you."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"Man, he was feeling himself there."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Holy [bleep]"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"I'm ballsy."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"He got the pass from the father-in-law."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"So is he married to Maria Shriver at this point?"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"He's gotta be, right?"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"Who was her father?"
01:53:08;01:53:09;"Sergeant Shriver."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Who the hell was that?"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"I don't know. Her mom was a Kennedy and her dad was..."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"Was his name Sergeant Shriver?"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Sergeant Shriver. Here we go."
01:53:19;01:53:22;"He was the former U.S. ambassador to France."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"He's a politician."
01:53:23;01:53:28;"He was a Democratic Party's nominee for vice president in the '72 presidential election."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"Oh, he was the guy that replaced..."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"I mean, he got blown out. He was with McGovern."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"That's so funny, man."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"He was introduced to it by Sergeant Shriver."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"What's my wife going to say?"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"I can't do it. I'm doing a French accent. That's terrible."
01:53:43;01:53:46;"Also, the fact that his logic..."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"The way he's talking is so crazy."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"His logic is airtight."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"He's one step ahead of the interviewer."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"And I know, okay, because you're thorough."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"Next thing you ask me is, ""What does my wife think?"""
01:53:57;01:54:00;"He basically said, ""First of all, moron."
01:54:00;01:54:05;"My wife's father introduced me to stogies."
01:54:05;01:54:08;"Of course, my wife's father can never be wrong."
01:54:08;01:54:11;"Therefore, she cannot say..."""
01:54:11;01:54:14;"I'm going French, too. Oops."

01:54:18;01:54:20;"I forgot that he said ""stogies."""
01:54:20;01:54:22;"And then just at the end, just so out of nowhere,"

01:54:28;01:54:31;"Anyway, you can understand why I was confused by this song."

01:54:34;01:54:38;"the Bruno Mars Anderson Pack collective man,"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"was not a ballsy stud and was being told"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"that he couldn't smoke in the house,"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"so he had to smoke out the window."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"You know, that's what I thought."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"I think if this song had come out in 1987,"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"then you'd be right on the money."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"I think cultural norms have shifted."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"Right. Nobody wants a smelly house."
01:54:56;01:54:59;"It'd be great to interview Arnold now and be like,"

02:03:08;02:03:12;"which in that era was like a lifetime."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"Right, yeah, true, yeah, truly."
02:03:14;02:03:17;"And from '66 to '69, a lot changed."
02:03:17;02:03:18;"Yeah."
02:03:18;02:03:21;"The number one song right now in 2021,"
02:03:21;02:03:23;"we're definitely gonna be able to listen to this,"
02:03:23;02:03:27;"is Taylor Swift's ""All Too Well"" 10-minute version."
02:03:27;02:03:28;"Now, the--"
02:03:28;02:03:29;"Wow."
02:03:29;02:03:31;"We were talking about this a little bit on the thread"
02:03:31;02:03:32;"because somebody made a joke,"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"is Taylor Swift a jam band?"
02:03:34;02:03:35;"Right."
02:03:35;02:03:37;"So we talked previously about how she's re-recording"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"a lot of her old albums"
02:03:39;02:03:42;"so that she can regain control of her masters,"
02:03:42;02:03:45;"which seems like she's doing a very good job of."
02:03:45;02:03:47;"But she's also like having some fun with them,"
02:03:47;02:03:50;"and I guess this song was a fan favorite."
02:03:50;02:03:54;"So we gotta assume that the 10-minute version"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"just has more verses."
02:03:56;02:03:57;"Have you heard it?"
02:03:57;02:03:59;"No."
02:03:59;02:04:00;"10 minutes?"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"It's like a folk song, just with a lot of verses."
02:04:02;02:04:05;"It's like ""Desolation Row"" or something."
02:04:05;02:04:06;"Yeah."
02:04:06;02:04:11;"♪ In your drawer even now ♪"
02:04:11;02:04:13;"So she performed the 10-minute version on SNL."

02:04:15;02:04:18;"Listen, whether it's adding extra verses or jamming,"
02:04:18;02:04:23;"always gotta support a blank-minute version of any song."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"Especially double-digit."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"It's gotta be eight minimum."
02:04:27;02:04:28;"Yeah."
02:04:28;02:04:30;"Ten, even better."

02:04:32;02:04:34;"Oh, so it says she originally wrote a 10-minute version,"
02:04:34;02:04:37;"but she didn't want to have a 10-minute version on the album,"
02:04:37;02:04:39;"so she cut down a lot of verses."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"All right."
02:04:40;02:04:41;"Oh, I see."
02:04:41;02:04:44;"Okay, well, time to wrap it up."
02:04:44;02:04:48;"I think we should go out with one more Rod Stewart song."
