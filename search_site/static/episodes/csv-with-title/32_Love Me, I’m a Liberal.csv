00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, welcome to December."
00:04;00:09;"On today's Time Crisis, we're going to ask the hard questions."
00:09;00:11;"Like, what is a liberal?"
00:11;00:14;"We'll hear from a socialist and a conservative."
00:14;00:21;"We'll also pay tribute to a great man, Michael James Delegati, the creator of the Big Mac."
00:21;00:25;"This, plus the hits of 1967 and today."
00:25;00:27;"On today's..."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:33;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:33;00:35;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"Do I, I felt, do I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I tell to the globe, one of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:18;"Leave her lonely babe."
01:18;01:23;"Sparing but concealing."
01:23;01:28;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:52;01:56;"I found a picture of you."
01:56;02:04;"Oh, what hijacked my world at night."
02:04;02:08;"To a place in the past we've been passed out of."
02:08;02:16;"Oh, now we're back in the fight."
02:16;02:22;"Back on the train again."
02:22;02:32;"Oh, back on the train again."
02:32;02:38;"Circumstance beyond our control."
02:38;02:45;"The phone, the TV and the news of the world."
02:45;02:49;"We've gotten the house like a pigeon from hell."
02:49;02:57;"Oh, through sand in our eyes and descended like flies."
02:57;03:00;"Put us back on the train."
03:00;03:09;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
03:09;03:12;"Back on the train again."
03:33;03:36;"The powers that be."
03:36;03:39;"The forces to live like we do."
03:39;03:42;"Bring me to my knees."
03:42;03:45;"When I see what they've done to you."
03:52;03:55;"I'll die as I stand here today."
03:55;03:58;"Knowing that deep in my heart."
03:58;04:12;"They'll fall to ruin one day for making us part."
04:12;04:15;"I found a picture of you."
04:15;04:24;"Oh, those were the happiest days of my life."
04:24;04:28;"Never breaking the battle was your part."
04:28;04:36;"Oh, in the wretched life of a lonely heart."
04:36;04:42;"Now we're back on the train again."
04:42;04:49;"Oh, back on the train again."
04:49;04:51;"That was the pretentious of back on the train again."
04:51;04:54;"And we're back on the chain gang, the time crisis chain gang."
04:54;04:55;"What's up, Jake?"
04:55;04:56;"Uh, not much."
04:56;04:57;"How are you?"
04:57;04:58;"Not bad."
04:58;04:59;"You like that song?"
04:59;05:01;"Yeah, wait, that was the pretenders?"
05:01;05:02;"Yeah."
05:02;05:03;"Back on the chain gang."
05:03;05:06;"Isn't there like an old chain gang song too?"
05:06;05:08;"Yeah, there's Sam Cooke."
05:08;05:10;"That's where they got the idea to do the chain gang noises."
05:10;05:11;"Huh."
05:11;05:16;"And like hitting the-- I was listening to this song recently, and I was like, Chrissy"
05:16;05:17;"Hynde is a great songwriter."
05:17;05:18;"Yeah."
05:18;05:19;"You know what's funny?"
05:19;05:23;"She's one of those people that I recognize that it's great, but I just don't connect."
05:23;05:27;"Well, you know, back on the chain gang, Brass in Pocket, you know."
05:27;05:28;"Yeah."
05:28;05:29;"I'm just talking about the hits, really."
05:29;05:30;"Great voice."
05:30;05:34;"But one thing that-- I never put this together, that-- so back on the chain gang is this pretenders"
05:34;05:36;"song from the early '80s."
05:36;05:43;"And then one of my other favorite artists, Selena, rest in peace, one of her big hits,"
05:43;05:47;"I think it was her brother, basically just took back on the chain gang and wrote like"
05:47;05:52;"a different lyrics in Spanish, like lightly inspired, like not quite a cover, more like"
05:52;05:56;"taking the music and then kind of like running with it."
05:56;05:58;"Like the Spanish lyrics, listen to this."
05:58;05:59;"I don't think I know it."
05:59;06:01;"Fotos y recuerdos."
06:01;06:02;"Did you study Spanish?"
06:02;06:03;"Yeah."
06:03;06:04;"So what does that mean?"
06:04;06:05;"Fotos?"
06:06;06:07;"Yeah."
06:07;06:09;"Y recuerdos."
06:09;06:10;"Oh, and memories?"
06:10;06:14;"Wait, and-- like, y being and, and then--"
06:14;06:16;"Yeah, it's like pictures and memories, photos and memories."
06:16;06:17;"I think."
06:17;06:20;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS]"
06:20;06:21;"Oh, yeah."
06:21;06:29;"From early '80s England to '90s Texas."
06:29;06:32;"Originating in Akron, Ohio, though."
06:32;06:35;"Christian-- right, true."
06:35;06:37;"Fully global."
06:37;06:38;"There's that riff."
06:38;06:41;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS]"
06:42;06:45;"[VOCALIZING]"
06:45;06:48;"[SINGING IN SPANISH]"
06:48;07:14;"Did you get the idea?"
07:14;07:15;"Yeah."
07:15;07:17;"But I love things like that."
07:17;07:21;"Two strong women connected across the decades"
07:21;07:23;"by the power of song."
07:23;07:25;"Also, like, back on the chain gang,"
07:25;07:28;"it's definitely a classic, but it's not like--"
07:28;07:30;"I wonder how many people, like, Selena fans"
07:30;07:34;"are also Pretenders fans."
07:34;07:35;"Well, that song is in the ether enough,"
07:35;07:39;"where I bet people who are hardcore Selena fans"
07:39;07:42;"might be like, this sounds familiar."
07:42;07:44;"I guess also when this came out, though, in the '90s,"
07:44;07:46;"you couldn't just, like, go to the Wikipedia"
07:46;07:49;"or the Genius page for Fotos Y Recuerdos"
07:49;07:51;"and be like, oh, you know, this is kind of like"
07:51;07:54;"an alternate version of Back on the Chain Gang."
07:54;07:56;"You might find that out, like, years later."
07:56;07:58;"If you're digging deep into the liner notes,"
07:58;08:01;"you're going to see a credit to the Pretenders for sure."
08:01;08:03;"Right, when you see that this song is credited"
08:03;08:05;"to Selena's brother and Chrissy Hind,"
08:05;08:08;"are the songwriters of Fotos Y Recuerdos."
08:08;08:09;"Yeah."
08:09;08:13;"RIP Selena, time crisis favorite, always missing you."
08:13;08:16;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS, ""TODO LO QUE ME QUEDA""]"
08:37;08:41;"Well, Jake, it was nice to just enjoy the power of music"
08:41;08:42;"as a connecting force--"
08:42;08:43;"Absolutely."
08:43;08:44;"--from the Pretenders to Selena."
08:44;08:49;"But unfortunately, these times are not all positive, are they?"
08:49;08:50;"No."
08:50;08:55;"And this is our second show back since Trump won the election."
08:55;08:56;"Yeah."
08:56;08:57;"How are you feeling?"
08:57;08:58;"Eh."
08:58;09:01;"I mean, in my life, you know, pretty good."
09:01;09:04;"But it does feel like a weird diagnosis or something."
09:04;09:06;"You know, you, like, leave a movie or something,"
09:06;09:08;"and you're like, oh, Trump won."
09:08;09:09;"Right."
09:09;09:12;"I'll think about the fact that Trump won maybe, like,"
09:12;09:14;"three times during the course of a movie."
09:14;09:16;"I'll be basically immersed--"
09:16;09:17;"Like, in the theater?"
09:17;09:18;"--or at home, whatever, just, like,"
09:18;09:21;"immersed in whatever I'm sort of, like, absorbing."
09:21;09:22;"Right."
09:22;09:24;"But then it'll, like, be kind of creeping"
09:24;09:25;"along the edges of my consciousness."
09:25;09:28;"And then when I leave the theater--"
09:28;09:29;"Yeah."
09:29;09:32;"--it'll be fully, like, oh."
09:32;09:33;"You step back into the daylight."
09:33;09:34;"Yep."
09:34;09:35;"That Trump daylight."
09:35;09:37;"I saw ""Arrival."""
09:37;09:39;"I didn't think about Trump once."
09:39;09:42;"I think it's because of Denis Villeneuve's"
09:42;09:46;"tight storytelling, the compelling narrative,"
09:46;09:49;"as well as groundbreaking performances"
09:49;09:51;"by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner."
09:51;09:54;"All those things helped keep me in the moment,"
09:54;09:57;"keep my mind off of President Trump."
09:57;09:58;"You didn't see it yet?"
09:58;09:59;"I want to see it."
09:59;10:00;"It looks great."
10:00;10:02;"And I loved his last film, ""Sicario."""
10:02;10:03;"He's an interesting guy."
10:03;10:07;"He's making movies about the drug war, aliens."
10:07;10:08;"Yeah."
10:08;10:10;"It's kind of a linguistics aliens movie."
10:10;10:11;"Yeah."
10:11;10:14;"You know, Jake, one thing I thought we'd talk about today"
10:14;10:17;"is what it means to be a liberal."
10:17;10:20;"Because it's a word that's been flying around a lot."
10:20;10:23;"I mean, always, but especially post-election."
10:23;10:25;"Tensions have been running high."
10:25;10:27;"And you know, I realized something."
10:27;10:30;"For most of my life, I didn't even know if I was a liberal."
10:30;10:32;"I mean, I kind of thought I was."
10:32;10:34;"We both would probably describe ourselves as people"
10:34;10:36;"who were raised in liberal households."
10:36;10:38;"Moderately liberal."
10:38;10:40;"Moderate liberal households."
10:40;10:43;"But it's been interesting that after you see a lot of infighting"
10:43;10:46;"on what people call the left, right?"
10:46;10:47;"Right."
10:47;10:50;"You see a lot of people saying, like, Hillary was a liberal."
10:50;10:53;"She was a moderate liberal, but that's not what we needed."
10:53;10:57;"And increasingly, you see people making fun of liberals."
10:57;10:58;"And I realized something."
10:58;11:01;"Like, you know, a lot of people think liberal just means"
11:01;11:03;"that you're not a conservative."
11:03;11:04;"Right."
11:04;11:06;"So you see a lot of people being like, hey, come on."
11:06;11:08;"We're all liberals here. Let's agree."
11:08;11:11;"But some people on the left don't identify as liberals."
11:11;11:14;"So we're going to talk to some people."
11:14;11:17;"We got Rehan Salam, who's a conservative."
11:17;11:19;"He's going to tell us what liberal means to him."
11:19;11:21;"Because you can't ask a liberal what it means to be a liberal."
11:21;11:22;"You know?"
11:22;11:23;"They don't know."
11:23;11:24;"That's just what they are."
11:24;11:27;"And we're also going to talk to Conor Kilpatrick,"
11:27;11:31;"who is a socialist or perhaps a Marxist."
11:31;11:33;"Works at a socialist magazine called Jacobin."
11:33;11:35;"So we're going to get some different perspectives."
11:35;11:37;"But first of all, do you know this song from the '60s,"
11:37;11:39;"""Phil Oaks, Love Me, I'm a Liberal""?"
11:39;11:41;"I don't know if I do."
11:41;11:44;"So this whole, like, liberal radical divide"
11:44;11:47;"or liberal socialist divide, it goes back all the way to the '60s."
11:47;11:50;"So Phil Oaks was, like, a folk singer."
11:50;11:51;"Sure."
11:51;11:53;"You know, he was on the right side of history, right?"
11:53;11:54;"Yeah."
11:54;11:56;"He was like a fight the power type guy."
11:56;11:57;"But so he had this song."
11:57;11:58;"This is from the '60s."
11:58;12:00;"Let's listen to it, and let's go, you know,"
12:00;12:03;"go back to the '60s and see what people were talking about back then."
12:03;12:07;"In every American community, you have varying shades of political opinion."
12:07;12:09;"One of the shadiest of these is the liberals."
12:09;12:17;"[applause]"
12:17;12:21;"An outspoken group on many subjects."
12:21;12:24;"Ten degrees to the left of center in good times."
12:24;12:27;"Ten degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally."
12:27;12:33;"[applause]"
12:33;12:36;"So here, then, is a lesson in safe logic."
12:39;12:43;"I cried when they shot Medgar Evers."
12:43;12:47;"Tears ran down my spine."
12:47;12:51;"And I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy."
12:51;12:55;"As though I'd lost a father of mine."
12:55;12:59;"But Malcolm X got what was coming."
12:59;13:03;"He got what he asked for this time."
13:03;13:07;"So love me, love me, love me."
13:07;13:10;"I'm a liberal."
13:10;13:13;"Get it?"
13:13;13:15;"Sort of."
13:15;13:16;"Let's stick with him."
13:16;13:18;"Okay, yeah, I'm in."
13:18;13:22;"I go to civil rights rallies."
13:22;13:25;"And I put down the old DAR."
13:25;13:30;"DAR, that's the dykes of the American Revolution."
13:30;13:33;"I love Harry and Sidney and Sammy."
13:33;13:37;"I hope every colored boy becomes a star."
13:37;13:41;"But don't talk about revolution."
13:41;13:45;"That's going a little bit too far."
13:45;13:48;"So love me, love me, love me."
13:48;13:52;"I'm a liberal."
13:52;13:56;"I cheered when Humphrey was chosen."
13:56;14:00;"My faith in the system restored."
14:00;14:03;"And I'm glad that the commies were thrown out"
14:03;14:07;"from the AFL-CIO bar."
14:07;14:11;"And I love Puerto Ricans and Negroes"
14:11;14:15;"as long as they don't move next door."
14:15;14:18;"So love me, love me, love me."
14:18;14:22;"I'm a liberal."
14:22;14:26;"Ah, the people of old Mississippi"
14:26;14:30;"should all hang their heads in shame."
14:30;14:33;"Now I can't understand how their minds work."
14:33;14:34;"What's the matter?"
14:34;14:38;"Don't they watch Last Crane?"
14:38;14:42;"But if you ask me to bust my children,"
14:42;14:46;"I hope the cops take down your name."
14:46;14:49;"So love me, love me, love me."
14:49;14:53;"I'm a liberal."
14:53;14:57;"Yes, I read New Republic and Nation."
14:57;15:00;"I've learned to take every view."
15:00;15:04;"You know, I've memorized Lerner and Golden."
15:04;15:08;"I feel like I'm almost a Jew."
15:08;15:12;"But when it comes to times like Korea,"
15:12;15:16;"there's no one more red, white, and blue."
15:16;15:19;"So love me, love me, love me."
15:19;15:23;"I'm a liberal."
15:23;15:27;"I vote for the Democratic Party."
15:27;15:30;"They want the U.N. to be strong."
15:30;15:34;"I attend all the Pete Seeger concerts."
15:34;15:37;"He sure gets me singing those songs."
15:37;15:41;"And I'll send all the money you ask for."
15:41;15:45;"But don't ask me to come on along."
15:45;15:48;"So love me, love me, love me."
15:48;15:53;"I'm a liberal."
15:53;15:57;"Sure, once I was young and impulsive."
15:57;16:01;"I wore every conceivable pin."
16:01;16:04;"Even went to socialist meetings."
16:04;16:08;"Learned all the old union hymns."
16:08;16:12;"Ah, but I've grown older and wiser."
16:12;16:17;"And that's why I'm turning you in."
16:17;16:20;"So love me, love me, love me."
16:20;16:26;"I'm a liberal."
16:26;16:30;"I'm a liberal."
16:31;16:37;"I'm a liberal."
24:07;24:13;"So I'm interested to find out from a socialist and a conservative what liberalism means to them."
24:13;24:19;"Because so often, you know, like we grew up in our moderate liberal households, we just accept that we're liberals."
24:19;24:23;"We're daily show liberals."
24:23;24:27;"It's definitely a type."
24:27;24:33;"Well, so the first person I'm going to talk to, his name is Connor Kilpatrick."
24:33;24:39;"I met him for the first time when I was home in New York last week."
24:39;24:45;"He's a liberal."
24:51;24:57;"J-A-C-O-B-I-N."
24:57;25:03;"I think it's related to the French revolution."
25:03;25:09;"He's a liberal."
41:03;41:11;"He's a liberal."
41:11;41:17;"He's a liberal."
41:53;42:01;"He's a liberal."
42:01;42:07;"He's a liberal."
01:20:19;01:20:25;"I tried so hard"
01:20:25;01:20:31;"to make it in America."
01:20:31;01:20:37;"I tried so hard"
01:20:37;01:20:43;"to make it in America."
01:20:43;01:20:49;"A land of milk and honey."
01:20:49;01:20:55;"A land supposed to be built with love."
01:20:55;01:21:01;"It takes love and understanding"
01:21:01;01:21:07;"to live and let live."
01:21:07;01:21:13;"I was born in Gainesville, Florida."
01:21:13;01:21:19;"I traveled far and wide."
01:21:19;01:21:25;"Then I moved to Brooklyn, New York."
01:21:25;01:21:29;"Had a hard time."
01:21:29;01:21:33;"But sometimes I hold on."
01:21:33;01:21:39;"Why did it take so hard"
01:21:39;01:21:45;"to make it in America?"
01:21:45;01:21:51;"I tried so hard"
01:21:51;01:21:57;"to make it in America."
01:21:57;01:22:03;"Seemed like nothing was going right."
01:22:03;01:22:09;"So I said to myself,"
01:22:09;01:22:13;"you gotta move away from here."
01:22:13;01:22:17;"I went upstate New York,"
01:22:17;01:22:21;"a little town they call McKimsey."
01:22:21;01:22:25;"Got me a job to get away"
01:22:25;01:22:29;"from all that stress."
01:22:29;01:22:35;"But I couldn't get away."
01:22:35;01:22:39;"No matter how far I went,"
01:22:39;01:22:47;"seemed like nothing's gonna change."
01:22:47;01:22:53;"Everything still remained the same."
01:22:53;01:22:59;"Why did it take so hard"
01:22:59;01:23:07;"to make it in America?"
01:23:07;01:23:13;"I tried so hard"
01:23:13;01:23:19;"to make it in America."
01:23:19;01:23:25;"Why is it so hard?"
01:23:31;01:23:35;"Tell me, tell me."
01:23:35;01:23:39;"Why is it so hard?"
01:23:39;01:23:43;"We gotta make a change in America."
01:23:43;01:23:47;"Take a health in the body."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Anyway, let's see what's going on in Top 5, man."
01:23:49;01:23:57;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:23:57;01:24:01;"Okay, so this week we're gonna compare the current Top 5 songs on iTunes"
01:24:01;01:24:05;"to the Top 5 Billboard hits this year, 1967. Why?"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"Because that was the year that the Big Mac was introduced."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Invented, not introduced."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Oh, invented."
01:24:11;01:24:16;"Introduced in '68, which is really, obviously, the real kind of spiritual core of this show."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"Oh, okay, well we're going back one year."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"We're gonna go one year earlier."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"This one is for Michael James Delegati."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"So the year that he was inventing the Big Mac."
01:24:24;01:24:28;"The number 5 song on the charts while he was tinkering away in his test kitchen"
01:24:28;01:24:33;"was ""Gladys Night in the Pips, I Heard It Through the Grapevine."""
01:24:33;01:24:37;"I don't know this version."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I mean, I know the Marvin Gaye one."
01:24:39;01:24:43;"Oh, yeah. I guess this is our one."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Yeah, I don't know this one as well."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"I guess I kind of know it."
01:25:16;01:25:20;"Michael Legoliddy. What is his name?"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Michael James Delegati."
01:25:22;01:25:29;"Michael James Delegati sweating it out in his kitchen."
01:25:29;01:25:32;"One part mayonnaise, one part ketchup."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"This would actually be--"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"One part mustard."
01:25:34;01:25:39;"I know we always say this, but this would be the perfect montage music for just like--"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"I mean, this is so classic. There's always that part in the movie, like in the first third,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"where it's like, ""Well, let's get to work and try this thing, man."""
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Montage."
01:25:46;01:25:51;"Yeah, he's sweating. There'd be some funny moment, like his son comes in."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Or you see time passing, like the wife comes down."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"It's 1 a.m. You can't hear what they're saying. He's like, ""Well..."""
01:25:57;01:26:02;"Yeah, she's pregnant, and then smash cut, like the next scene, she's holding the baby."
01:26:02;01:26:06;"Yeah, she's still holding the baby behind him, but he's still tinkering on the Big Mac."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"Could be a good movie."
01:26:07;01:26:10;"Founder, dude. Founder's coming out."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"Yeah, it felt like it should have come out already."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"I think it's coming out now."
01:26:14;01:26:18;"What's up with the Oscars? They wait forever for these movies to come out. It's insane."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"They released like 15 movies in the last week of the year."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Oscars feels so irrelevant."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Yeah, no, it's insane. Anyways."
01:26:24;01:26:27;"But let's talk about what's actually relevant. The top five songs on iTunes."
01:26:27;01:26:34;"The number five song this week is Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello, ""Bad Things."""
01:26:34;01:26:39;"Machine Gun Kelly, he's a nice guy. I met him once."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Oh, yeah? Where'd you meet him?"
01:26:41;01:26:48;"We were at the same wedding. Well, yeah, we were at the same wedding."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Who was getting married?"
01:26:50;01:26:54;"Not a direct friend of mine. A friend of a friend."
01:26:54;01:27:00;"That's a weird name. Isn't Machine Gun Kelly like an Al Capone era gangster?"
01:27:00;01:27:04;"I guess. He's like a tall, white guy with a lot of tattoos."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"So rude."
01:27:12;01:27:20;"Is that Machine Gun?"
01:27:20;01:27:23;"Yeah. This is a vibey song."
01:27:23;01:27:34;"It's like a slight... The chord progressions, a little Pachelbel's Canyon, but they go minor."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"They change it up a little bit."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"I like it."
01:27:39;01:27:51;"A lot of songs use this chord progression."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"It's classic. I like it."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"""Don't Look Back in Anger"" by Oasis."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Yeah. ""Step"" by Vampire Weekend."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Oh, really?"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"""Basket Case"" by Green Day."
01:28:03;01:28:11;"There's a Green Day song that uses it, too. ""Basket Case."""
01:28:11;01:28:15;"But they change it just enough."
01:28:15;01:28:19;"It sounds like he's so familiar."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Yeah, that melody is really familiar."
01:28:21;01:28:24;"""No matter what you say, na na ba da da da."""
01:28:24;01:28:27;"""Na na na na na na na na na."""
01:28:27;01:28:30;"""Only wanna do bad things to you."""
01:28:30;01:28:35;"""No matter what you say, no matter what you do."""
01:28:35;01:28:41;"I don't have that much to say about this song other than this is the first time I've heard it."
01:28:41;01:28:46;"It's number five on the charts in this weird interim period before Trump takes office."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"God bless it."
01:28:47;01:28:52;"That's an incredibly eerie sentiment to start echoing across America."
01:28:52;01:28:57;"""No matter what you say, no matter what you do."""
01:28:57;01:29:00;"""I only wanna do bad things to you."""
01:29:00;01:29:02;"Good Lord."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Right around Christmas time, too?"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"That's people's feelings towards Trump."
01:29:07;01:29:12;"And it's Trump's feelings towards people that don't like him."
01:29:12;01:29:16;"If this song's number five now, if it has legs, it could be number one by Christmas."
01:29:17;01:29:22;"Just imagine that you're a seven-year-old kid, older sibling is just blasting this."
01:29:22;01:29:27;"And it's just like, ""No matter what you say, no matter what you do."""
01:29:27;01:29:29;"""I only wanna do bad."""
01:29:29;01:29:30;"It's a very horror movie."
01:29:30;01:29:35;"And then you're like, ""Guys, this afternoon, Hacksaw Ridge is playing at 4 p.m."""
01:29:35;01:29:38;"But Tommy's only seven."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"It's alright."
01:29:39;01:29:44;"It's like a really bloody World War II movie. It's rated R. It's fine."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"He's gotta learn about history sometime."
01:29:46;01:29:53;"The number four song this week in 1967 is Dionne Warwick, ""I Say a Little Prayer for You."""
01:29:53;01:29:59;"Another kind of ""I something you"" formulation."
01:29:59;01:30:02;"""But I don't wanna do bad things to you. I say a little prayer for you."""
01:30:02;01:30:03;"Super kind."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Is this Bacharach?"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Oh yeah."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"I love this part of the verse."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Oh, my makeup!"
01:30:18;01:30:21;"I say a little prayer for you"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"Walk on in my hand now"
01:30:25;01:30:29;"And wondering what dress to wear now"
01:30:29;01:30:32;"I say a little prayer for you"
01:30:32;01:30:35;"Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"And I will love you forever and ever"
01:30:38;01:30:41;"We never will part, oh how I'll love you"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"Together, together, that's how it must be"
01:30:44;01:30:48;"To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me"
01:30:48;01:30:49;"Kind of..."
01:30:49;01:30:50;"Amazing."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"It's amazing. A beautiful song, but..."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Even that's a little eerie when you think about it, 'cause it's like..."
01:30:54;01:30:57;"This also could be kind of like a stalker song."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"You know, there's some songs that are like, ""I love you so much,"""
01:31:00;01:31:03;"but there's something eerie about the first verse being like,"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"""I'm by myself. You're somewhere else."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"I woke up this morning. Before I even put on my makeup."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"You came into my mind."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"And I called upon our Lord, our God, to protect you."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"Then later in the day, I was doing something else."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"Still hadn't heard from you."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"But you also came into my mind, and I called upon the Lord, our God,"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"to protect you."""
01:31:25;01:31:28;"And then, like, the end of the chorus is,"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"""To live without you would only bring heartbreak for me."""
01:31:31;01:31:33;"Are they dating?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"I wanna hear some more of this."
01:31:35;01:31:38;"I run for the bus, dear"
01:31:38;01:31:42;"I'm riding on a fiend for the lost, dear"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"I say a little prayer for the weary"

01:32:08;01:32:13;"To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"I'm just gonna take the song at face value,"
01:32:16;01:32:20;"given the sort of jubilant,"
01:32:20;01:32:24;"positive, emotional vibe of the song."
01:32:24;01:32:27;"They still haven't actually been together in the song."

01:32:45;01:32:47;"This kind of reminds me of Eminem's ""Stan."""
01:32:47;01:32:50;"Dude, that's weird you said that. I totally thought of Eminem."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Do you mean like your dark stalker version?"
01:32:52;01:32:55;"I was like, if it was minor key, it would be Eminem."
01:32:55;01:32:58;"""We should be together too."""
01:32:58;01:33:01;"That's one of my favorite endings of any song ever"
01:33:01;01:33:04;"is when Eminem-- because Eminem is a brilliant lyricist,"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"but there's something so kind of goofy about how--"
01:33:07;01:33:10;"it's to make the song work, but there's these letters back and forth"
01:33:10;01:33:13;"and Stan gets progressively crazier"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"and eventually kills himself in another person."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"And I remember in the video, Eminem's finally going through his mail"
01:33:19;01:33:22;"to write back after this guy was driven so crazy"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"by his lack of response, and Eminem is saying like,"
01:33:25;01:33:28;"""Hey man, you know, well, I don't know what you mean by that,"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"but I hope things get better for you."""
01:33:30;01:33:32;"And at the end of the letter, Eminem goes,"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"""You know, don't do anything crazy."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"I heard about this guy who did something really crazy."""
01:33:37;01:33:40;"And the best part, ""His name was Stan too."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Oh, it was you."""
01:33:42;01:33:46;"I always thought the name Stan was the funniest choice for that."
01:33:46;01:33:50;"Have you ever met a dude under 50 whose name is Stan?"
01:33:50;01:33:54;"The only person I knew named Stan was a teacher who was much older than me."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"Yeah, well look, it had legs."
01:33:57;01:34:00;"He's a fan colloquially now, just me and a super fan."
01:34:00;01:34:04;"The number four song, ""Back to the Future"" in 2016"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"is Bruno Mars' ""24-Karat Magic."""

01:34:44;01:34:47;"Yeah, I won't be able to separate this song from Trump."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"It's a good song, but I--"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"But this song is also about materialist male arrogance."
01:34:53;01:34:56;"I love that you're so tapped in with these lyrics."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"Yeah, I'm a lyrics guy."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"This song is about literally introducing yourself,"

01:35:52;01:35:55;"I'm just saying, you know, like, lyrically."
