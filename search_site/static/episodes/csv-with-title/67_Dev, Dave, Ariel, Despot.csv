00:00;00:07;"There are points in history where great men's paths cross, words are exchanged, thoughts"
00:07;00:08;"are debated."
00:08;00:15;"An illustrious group of men will come together today on Time Crisis to talk about Goldfish,"
00:15;00:20;"the greatest hits of 1996, and Alanis Morissette one more time."
00:20;00:21;"Why not?"
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:26;00:33;"Peace."
01:11;01:14;"Time Crisis, we're back once again."
01:14;01:15;"What's up, Jake?"
01:15;01:16;"Hey."
01:16;01:18;"It's not just you and me in the studio this time, brother."
01:18;01:19;"Full house."
01:19;01:21;"We got a full house."
01:21;01:24;"Today is Time Crisis Battle Royale."
01:24;01:26;"[explosion]"
01:26;01:31;"Jake and I are joined in the studio by a veritable who's who of male musicians."
01:31;01:35;"We're joined by Deathspot, who's already part of the Time Crisis family."
01:35;01:36;"What's up, Deathspot?"
01:36;01:37;"Hi there."
01:37;01:38;"You're still in LA."
01:38;01:39;"You just can't get enough."
01:39;01:40;"I love it."
01:40;01:42;"You know, I used to think he was like a New York guy."
01:42;01:43;"Nah."
01:43;01:45;"I'm like a LA type guy now."
01:45;01:46;"Now you're like an LA type guy."
01:46;01:48;"This is it for me."
01:48;01:51;"You could check out anytime you like, but you just can never leave."
01:51;01:52;"You're right."
01:52;01:53;"Now you're really in the Hotel California."
01:53;01:58;"We're also joined by Ariel Rekshide, producer, lead singer of the Hippos."
01:58;01:59;"What's up?"
01:59;02:00;"What up?"
02:00;02:01;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
02:01;02:03;"You haven't been on in a couple years."
02:03;02:04;"Was I ever on?"
02:04;02:07;"Yeah, you came on and you taught everybody about being a producer."
02:07;02:09;"Oh, we did Usher."
02:09;02:10;"I remember that."
02:10;02:14;"Yeah, Ariel was one of the producers on Usher's Climax, as well as other things."
02:14;02:18;"Also worked with Vampire Weekend extensively."
02:18;02:23;"Also joined by Dev Hines, also known as Blood Orange to some."
02:23;02:24;"Hey, what's up?"
02:24;02:26;"Great to have you here in LA."
02:26;02:27;"Thanks."
02:27;02:29;"Was I on this show before?"
02:29;02:31;"I think you called into Time Crisis once."
02:31;02:39;"In my mind, I picture you on the air and I called in in real time, but that can't be true."
02:39;02:40;"Like a listener?"
02:40;02:41;"Yeah."
02:41;02:42;"A fan?"
02:42;02:43;"Yeah, this is definitely your first time in person."
02:43;02:44;"Well, thank you."
02:44;02:45;"Appreciate you having me here."
02:45;02:48;"And then we're also joined by Jake's brother, Dave Longstreth."
02:48;02:49;"What's up, Dave?"
02:49;02:50;"Hey, how's it going?"
02:50;02:52;"Dave from Dirty Projectors."
02:52;02:54;"Got some new music out."
02:54;02:56;"We're going to be listening to that real soon."
02:56;02:57;"Going on tour, too."
02:57;03:02;"So we've got two Longstreths, a Hines, a Rek'Shia, and a Rheinstein."
03:02;03:03;"Wait, is it Rheinstein?"
03:03;03:04;"Yes."
03:04;03:05;"I can never remember that."
03:05;03:07;"Got a Rheinstein and a Rek'Shia to me."
03:08;03:09;"This is what you call a flip."
03:09;03:11;"10 keys from a car to brick."
03:11;03:13;"Bentley from here, mama whip."
03:13;03:14;"KOD, he hard as shoot."
03:14;03:16;"This is what you call a flip."
03:16;03:18;"10 keys from a car to brick."
03:18;03:19;"Bentley from here, mama whip."
03:19;03:21;"KOD, he hard as shoot."
03:21;03:23;"This is what you call a flip."
03:23;03:24;"10 keys from a car to brick."
03:24;03:26;"Bentley from here, mama whip."
03:26;03:28;"KOD, he hard as shoot."
03:28;03:29;"This is what you call a flip."
03:29;03:31;"10 keys from a car to brick."
03:31;03:33;"Bentley from here, mama whip."
03:33;03:34;"KOD, he hard as shoot."
03:34;03:39;"Alright guys, so here's the rules for this Battle Royale Royal Rumble."
03:39;03:41;"I don't want a lot of cross talk."
03:41;03:50;"I want good pointed commentary about pop culture, corporate food, things of that nature, popular music, and the tasteful palate of the 1970s."
03:50;03:51;"That's what we're talking about."
03:51;03:59;"So to start, as I'm sure all of you know, two or three episodes ago, we went deep on the Alanis Morissette song ""Ironic""."
03:59;04:02;"Is anybody in the Battle Royale a big Alanis fan?"
04:02;04:03;"No."
04:03;04:05;"This is like teaching eighth grade."
04:05;04:06;"Yeah."
04:06;04:12;"Wait, were we talking about people not realizing her place?"
04:12;04:14;"Yes, we were."
04:14;04:15;"That was us."
04:15;04:20;"Yeah, because it was that same week that I recorded the show when I ran into you at the supermarket."
04:20;04:24;"Dev and I ran into each other at the supermarket and we were talking about all sorts of stuff."
04:24;04:28;"And one of the things I was telling you about is how I'd recently watched a lot of her music videos."
04:28;04:31;"And I was impressed by how good the music videos were and how iconic they were."
04:31;04:34;"So Dev, paint a picture for me."
04:34;04:37;"1996, where are you?"
04:37;04:39;"What's going on in the life of Dev Hines?"
04:39;04:41;"I'm 10 years old."
04:41;04:43;"That's about it."
04:43;04:44;"I don't know."
04:44;04:45;"Is that when ""Ironic"" came out?"
04:45;04:47;"Well, that's when the album, I think."
04:47;04:48;"""Jackie and the Little Pill""."
04:48;04:49;"It was '95."
04:49;04:53;"Maybe the album was '95 and those singles were just blasting into '96, '97."
04:53;04:56;"That's probably it, though, because that's what he did back then."
04:56;04:57;"That's like the Eagles, man."
04:57;05:00;"For a big album like that, we're talking like a three-year campaign."
05:00;05:01;"Yeah, a campaign, definitely."
05:01;05:05;"Well, what year did ""Dogma"" come out?"
05:05;05:07;"I'm guessing like '99, 2000."
05:07;05:09;"Is that an Alanis record?"
05:09;05:11;"No, that's a Kevin Smith film."
05:11;05:12;"Oh, yeah, the movie."
05:12;05:13;"Alanis plays God."
05:13;05:14;"She plays God."
05:14;05:15;"Oh, yeah."
05:15;05:17;"Yeah, that came out in '99."
05:17;05:18;"Good call."
05:18;05:22;"Well, so Jake and I, we were talking a few episodes ago about our favorite Alanis songs."
05:22;05:26;"Jake really likes the song from the next album, which is called ""Thank You""."
05:26;05:28;"I don't know if you guys remember this song."
05:28;05:32;"We check in with Alanis every few episodes here on Time Crisis."
05:32;05:33;"But ""Thank You""--"
05:33;05:35;"Jagged Little Pill follow-up?"
05:35;05:36;"Yeah, just imagine."
05:36;05:37;"We're all musicians here."
05:37;05:42;"None of us have ever tasted the success of ""Sweet"" as a Jagged Little Pill-type album."
05:42;05:45;"None of us have been on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""."
05:45;05:46;"None of us have been on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""."
05:46;05:51;"None of us have been the whole focal point of the trip to Italy."
05:51;05:53;"Oh, yeah, the Steve Coogan film."
05:53;05:56;"The point that we're continually trying to make on Time Crisis, she's a very major artist."
05:56;05:59;"As much as she was--we know--everybody knows her name and she was huge."
05:59;06:01;"She didn't always get the respect that she deserved."
06:01;06:04;"And just picture this, that you're her."
06:04;06:08;"She was like 20, 21 or something when she put out ""Jagged Little Pill""."
06:08;06:11;"And then imagine, you got to make a follow-up to one of the biggest albums of all time."
06:11;06:14;"""Jagged Little Pill"" was like the thriller of the '90s."
06:14;06:16;"Just a--"
06:16;06:18;"[laughter]"
06:18;06:19;"Kind of."
06:19;06:20;"Yeah, you're not--"
06:20;06:22;"Okay, wait, what was the thriller of the '90s then?"
06:22;06:25;"Well, it wasn't necessarily changing."
06:25;06:26;"Yeah, I was going to say that."
06:26;06:27;"The scope of music."
06:27;06:29;"[laughter]"
06:29;06:30;"A little known record."
06:30;06:31;"But I--"
06:31;06:32;"You know what I remember?"
06:32;06:33;"Sorry."
06:33;06:34;"Guys, too much crosstalk."
06:34;06:35;"Dave?"
06:35;06:39;"I remember the singles really told a story with ""Jagged Little Pill""."
06:39;06:40;"Yeah, all six of them."
06:40;06:41;"Yeah, exactly."
06:41;06:43;"All six of them, all six of those hit singles."
06:43;06:44;"Yeah, it was interesting."
06:44;06:47;"Taught us to think about the meaning of the word ""ironic""."
06:47;06:50;"Wait, the one about Uncle Joey was on that?"
06:50;06:51;"Yep, you ought to know."
06:51;06:52;"Yeah."
06:52;06:53;"The first one, right?"
06:53;06:54;"Yeah."
06:54;06:58;"It's still like hotly debated whether or not that was actually about Uncle Joey."
06:58;07:01;"Yeah, everybody knows it's about Uncle Joey."
07:01;07:03;"That's ""Flea on Bass"", right?"
07:03;07:04;"What?"
07:04;07:05;"""Flea on Bass""?"
07:05;07:06;"Yeah, ""Flea's on Bass""."
07:06;07:08;"Taylor Hawkins on drums."
07:08;07:09;"Wow, you're dropping knowledge."
07:09;07:11;"Yeah, see, actually, we talked about this a couple episodes ago."
07:11;07:13;"But yeah, listen to this, guys."
07:13;07:15;"Glenn Ballard, co-writer, producer."
07:15;07:16;"This is a new rule on Time Crisis."
07:16;07:21;"Every three episodes, we remind people how important Alanis Morissette is."
07:21;07:22;"All right, so this is-- you guys remember this."
07:22;07:25;"I want you to know."
07:25;07:27;"Also a very influential singer."
07:27;07:28;"Definitely."
07:28;07:32;"Who was singing, ""I want you to know""?"
07:32;07:34;"Who was singing like that before her?"
07:34;07:35;"Michael Jackson?"
07:35;07:36;"Well, yeah."
07:36;07:37;"Thriller of the 90s."
07:37;07:41;"It kind of felt a little bit like the female grunge, though."
07:41;07:44;"Well, yeah, she brought grunge into the pop room."
07:44;07:45;"An affected voice."
07:45;07:46;"Well, hold on, guys, but listen."
07:46;07:48;"Do you guys think she was coming out of, like, Riot Grrrl?"
07:48;07:49;"No."
07:49;07:51;"She probably knew that stuff a little."
07:51;07:52;"Because that would be so next level."
07:52;07:53;"I bet she didn't know it at all."
07:53;07:57;"She's coming out of Nickelodeon, and then she's aware of, like, Kathleen Hanna."
07:57;07:59;"She's down with Tori Amos."
07:59;08:03;"I don't-- I mean, that's just single-tracked vocal that's so raw."
08:03;08:04;"Hold on, guys."
08:04;08:05;"No, dude."
08:05;08:06;"Listen to the bass."
08:06;08:07;"That's fleek."
08:07;08:08;"[MUSIC - TORI AMOS, ""I WANT YOU TO KNOW""]"
08:08;08:11;"(SINGING) This is sweet Galaquani."
08:11;08:16;"And when she have your baby, I'm sure she'll make her really act such a mother."
08:16;08:17;"This song is sick."
08:17;08:18;"And this spot doesn't like a lot of it."
08:18;08:19;"Say that again."
08:19;08:21;"That song was sick."
08:21;08:22;"She was horny."
08:22;08:24;"It has, like, a Ben Kott stealing vibe."
08:24;08:26;"[MUSIC - TORI AMOS, ""I WANT YOU TO KNOW""]"
08:26;08:27;"[LAUGHS]"
08:27;08:30;"It's like Joni Mitchell with some Anthony Kiedis."
08:30;08:31;"Wow."
08:31;08:32;"[MUSIC - TORI AMOS, ""I WANT YOU TO KNOW""]"
08:32;08:34;"(SINGING) Does she know how you told me it'd help me until you died,"
08:34;08:36;"until you died?"
08:36;08:39;"But I am still alive and I'm here."
08:39;08:40;"Oh, that is fleek."
08:40;08:41;"Damn."
08:41;08:42;"And Taylor Hawkins."
08:42;08:43;"[MUSIC - TORI AMOS, ""I WANT YOU TO KNOW""]"
08:43;08:48;"(SINGING) All the mess you left when you went away, it's not fair."
08:48;08:53;"Do you deny me all the cross I've been?"
08:53;08:56;"That you gave to me, yeah, yeah, yeah."
08:56;08:58;"I don't know."
08:58;08:59;"Wait, hold on."
08:59;09:01;"Did you guys hear that little flea moment?"
09:01;09:02;"Yep."
09:02;09:03;"Oh, yeah."
09:03;09:05;"Hey, I'm going to drop a bomb on you, Ezra."
09:05;09:06;"Yeah?"
09:06;09:09;"You know who might have mixed the single version of that song"
09:09;09:11;"to the version we might be listening to right now?"
09:11;09:12;"Who?"
09:12;09:15;"It's debated because I think it was uncredited."
09:15;09:16;"Yeah?"
09:16;09:17;"Dave Shiffman."
09:17;09:19;"[EXPLOSION]"
09:19;09:20;"Wow."
09:20;09:22;"Dave Shiffman is a great engineer and producer who's--"
09:22;09:24;"Shout out to Dave Shiffman."
09:24;09:25;"--worked with Vampire Weekend--"
09:25;09:26;"That's right."
09:26;09:27;"--Blood Orange 2."
09:27;09:28;"That's right."
09:28;09:29;"Yeah, he did."
09:29;09:30;"First album."
09:31;09:32;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
09:32;09:33;"Crazy."
09:33;09:34;"Just imagine that you made the thriller of the '90s,"
09:34;09:36;"and then you got to come up with a follow-up, and you're like 23."
09:36;09:38;"Wait, ""Thank You"" was the follow-up single?"
09:38;09:40;"""Thank You"" was the first follow-up single from the next album"
09:40;09:42;"called ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie."""
09:42;09:44;"""Thank You"" was a smash, though, right?"
09:44;09:45;"Yeah."
09:45;09:46;"It was pretty big."
09:46;09:47;"It wasn't a smash?"
09:47;09:49;"Well, I just think the album wasn't as big."
09:49;09:51;"But yeah, it was a solid single."
09:51;09:52;"The album was not as big."
09:52;09:53;"It was hard to follow up."
09:53;09:54;"Not a smash."
09:54;09:55;"It wasn't a smash."
09:55;09:58;"So this is Jake's favorite Atlantis song, which is ""Thank You."""
09:58;10:05;"[MUSIC - JAKE'S FAVORITE ATLANTIS SONG, ""THANK YOU""]"
10:05;10:09;"It's Christmassy to me."
10:09;10:15;"(SINGING) How about getting off of these antibiotics?"
10:15;10:17;"Oh, I [BLEEP] love this song."
10:17;10:18;"Yeah, it's dope."
10:18;10:20;"I totally forgot about this."
10:20;10:26;"(SINGING) How about stopping eating when I am full up?"
10:26;10:30;"Still Glenn Ballard, you can tell."
10:30;10:33;"I love this."
10:33;10:35;"Listen to the drums."
10:35;10:37;"No, I really love this song."
10:37;10:40;"I totally forgot about it."
10:40;10:45;"How about that ever elusive good old--"
10:45;10:51;"thank you, India."
10:51;10:54;"Thank you, terror."
10:54;10:59;"Thank you, disillusionment."
10:59;11:02;"Thank you, frailty."
11:02;11:05;"Thank you, consequence."
11:05;11:06;"Thank you."
11:06;11:08;"Thank you, silence."
11:09;11:10;"You get the idea."
11:10;11:14;"The only thing I don't like about that song is ""thank you, India."""
11:14;11:17;"No disrespect if she had a great experience in India."
11:17;11:21;"Going to India to find yourself and then coming back to the Western world"
11:21;11:25;"and kind of bragging about it, that part's a little bit played out."
11:25;11:26;"But at least she was--"
11:26;11:27;"Back then, it wasn't."
11:27;11:28;"Yeah, it was a long time ago."
11:28;11:31;"In the late '90s, maybe it was still a little bit played out."
11:31;11:32;"But dude, she was 22."
11:32;11:33;"OK, fair enough."
11:33;11:34;"Wait, wait, wait."
11:34;11:36;"She was 22 doing the follow-up?"
11:36;11:38;"She was very young."
11:38;11:40;"I didn't realize how young she was."
11:40;11:42;"She was making ""Jagged Little Pill"" when she was like 19, 20."
11:42;11:45;"But anyway, Jake pointed out he thought that ""thank you"" kind of sounded like"
11:45;11:47;"another band."
11:47;11:49;"Did that remind you of anybody?"
11:49;11:52;"Well, there's five-string bass, Zeppelin."
11:52;11:53;"But just like the general vibe."
11:53;11:55;"Jake thought it reminded him of Radiohead a little bit,"
11:55;11:57;"which I can kind of see."
11:57;12:01;"Well, no, it's the same year as OK Computer, give or take."
12:09;12:11;"It sounded like DJ Shadow or something."
12:11;12:13;"It honestly reminds me more of--"
12:13;12:17;"That was the bigger influence that was seeping through all the other music."
12:17;12:18;"DJ Shadow?"
12:18;12:19;"Yeah, it was things like--"
12:19;12:20;"With that rap drum break."
12:20;12:21;"Yeah."
12:21;12:23;"It's kind of like a harder version of Radiohead,"
12:23;12:25;"but the rap drum break with the low bass guitar."
12:25;12:28;"Not the drum break, but just like the very beginning."
12:28;12:29;"Yeah, hard."
12:29;12:31;"But also it had a spacey Radiohead vibe."
12:31;12:35;"Yeah, and lyrics about antibiotics and disillusionment."
12:35;12:37;"So Jake--"
12:37;12:38;"I think Jake is too--"
12:38;12:40;"Very Radiohead."
12:40;12:41;"Jake is too-- he pointed out--"
12:41;12:42;"In a cage."
12:42;12:46;"--that perhaps in between the first and the second Atlantis album,"
12:46;12:49;"she was listening, as many people at the time were,"
12:49;12:51;"listening to little OK Computer."
12:51;12:53;"I'm not sure if the timeline lines up, but let's just--"
12:53;12:54;"The timeline does line up."
12:54;12:55;"Okay."
12:55;12:57;"I don't like that."
12:57;12:59;"Well, okay."
12:59;13:00;"My question is--"
13:00;13:01;"Hold on, Dev, you have the floor."
13:01;13:03;"Why don't you like that?"
13:03;13:08;"That's assuming that it wasn't necessarily some weird kind of cultural zeitgeist"
13:08;13:11;"and she didn't come to that place by herself"
13:11;13:13;"that happened to sound like Radiohead."
13:13;13:16;"Like how two different dudes invented light bulb."
13:16;13:17;"Right."
13:17;13:19;"Who was the other guy besides Edison?"
13:19;13:22;"Well, didn't Edison steal the patent?"
13:22;13:25;"Oh, okay, so they did independently."
13:25;13:26;"But I know what you mean."
13:26;13:29;"It's like-- and I think as all musicians we've got to be sensitive to it"
13:29;13:31;"because there's times that you play people some music and be like,"
13:31;13:34;"""Ah, listening to some Stevie Ray Vaughan."""
13:34;13:35;"I see."
13:35;13:38;"I was like, ""What the f--- are you talking about?"
13:38;13:40;"I haven't heard that s--- in my life."""
13:40;13:42;"But, okay."
13:42;13:43;"Come in the crossfire."
13:43;13:46;"I think that's a fair point, Dev."
13:46;13:47;"I just have another one, too."
13:47;13:48;"Sorry, my bad."
13:48;13:49;"I said I wasn't going to talk."
13:49;13:51;"No, no, no, now you're talking."
13:51;13:56;"What was the average age of an Alliance Mozart fan in the mid to late '90s,"
13:56;13:57;"do you think?"
13:57;14:00;"I think she was so massive that you probably were getting"
14:00;14:03;"40-something people buying CDs as well as tweens."
14:03;14:04;"Right."
14:04;14:07;"So maybe the average age would end up being like 20-something,"
14:07;14:09;"but she certainly had some very young fans."
14:09;14:14;"Because I'm curious about girls or women at that point"
14:14;14:20;"who were obsessed and their view now"
14:20;14:25;"and who are the musicians now that were influenced by Atlantis"
14:25;14:29;"that we may not even realize are huge Atlantis fans."
14:29;14:31;"We've got to do a third Atlantis episode."
14:31;14:35;"This is the second where we do a true roundtable of people who were inspired."
14:35;14:40;"Dev, is there any obvious Atlantis influence in your music?"
14:40;14:45;"None, but maybe some of that weird DJ Shadow s---."
17:20;17:25;"The reason that I brought this up, thank you, and Jake saying maybe it sounded like Radiohead,"
17:25;17:30;"you never know who came first with an idea, like sometimes some s--- blows up,"
17:30;17:36;"so you think that was very influential, and you might sometimes get the chronology backwards about who influenced who."
17:36;17:40;"So we were listening to that, maybe Linus was listening to some OK Computer, but we got an interesting email"
17:40;17:44;"to remind us that, who knows, there was a heady stew brewing in the 90s."
17:44;17:48;"It narrowly edges out the 60s for just like a big time of change."
17:48;17:50;"Like bigger than the 60s, is that what you're saying?"
17:50;17:51;"Yes."
17:51;17:52;"I agree."
17:52;17:53;"Thank you."
17:53;17:54;"I agree with that."
17:54;17:57;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
17:57;18:01;"So we got this email from a guy named George Singleton."
18:01;18:03;"He's from London. Do you know him?"
18:03;18:04;"Oh, yeah, George."
18:04;18:06;"[laughter]"
18:06;18:09;"He says, ""Dear Ezra, Jake, and Seinfeld,"
18:09;18:12;"given the few opportunities there are to mention the following bit of trivia"
18:12;18:15;"without deliberately steering the conversation that way,"
18:15;18:17;"I felt that I couldn't pass this one up."
18:17;18:23;"I don't know if this is the reason that the Atlanta song played on the last Time Crisis show sounds like Radiohead,"
18:23;18:25;"but it's a weird coincidence if not."
18:25;18:29;"Radiohead road-tested and worked on most of the OK Computer songs."
18:29;18:30;"Wilst."""
18:30;18:31;"Wilst?"
18:31;18:34;"English people always say-- do you say ""wilst"" out loud as an English person?"
18:34;18:35;"It's ""wilst."""
18:35;18:36;"""Wilst."""
18:36;18:37;"Yeah."
18:37;18:39;"You say ""wilst?"""
18:39;18:41;"I don't say it. I say ""wile."""
18:41;18:43;"No, no, no, it's ""wilst."""
18:43;18:44;"I'm all American."
18:44;18:45;"It's ""wilst."""
18:46;18:48;"But do you say it out loud?"
18:48;18:52;"Yeah, I say it as a word in my vocabulary."
18:52;18:55;"It's not a fancy word. It's just a mundane--"
18:55;18:59;"No, it's just-- it has no more importance than the other words."
18:59;19:04;"So, Radiohead road-tested and worked on most of the OK Computer songs,"
19:04;19:06;"""wilst,"""
19:06;19:10;"playing as Alanis' warm-up for her 1996 US tour,"
19:10;19:12;"the year before OK Computer came out."
19:12;19:18;"They debuted a seven-minute Paranoid Android with some crazy long organ outro, which is on YouTube."
19:18;19:22;"I think that was the first time they played ""Karma Police"" and ""Climbing Up the Walls 2"" with different lyrics."
19:22;19:27;"The total absence of crowd reaction is really interesting, given how big the album was the following year."
19:27;19:33;"P.S. Any chance Dave might drop by for another episode whenever the new Dirty Projector stuff he's been teasing comes out?"
19:33;19:36;"The episode with him and Emma, my sister, was one of the best."
19:36;19:38;"DPs are my favorite band of all time."
19:38;19:41;"No offense to VW and Grateful Dead cover band."
19:41;19:43;"So I could not ask. Regardless, have a great week."
19:43;19:46;"All the best from London, England, George."
19:46;19:47;"Wow."
19:47;19:53;"Guys, can you imagine, just 1996, just catching a Radiohead opening for Alanis,"
19:53;19:59;"just the height of ""Jagged Little Pill,"" and Radiohead is just, you know, working out these new songs?"
19:59;20:01;"How sick would that have been?"
20:01;20:02;"Amazing."
20:02;20:06;"I think I've told you that I saw Radiohead, not even a big Radiohead fan here,"
20:06;20:09;"but I saw Radiohead at the Troubadour before OK Computer."
20:09;20:12;"Which, for people who don't know, is about like 100 people fitting there."
20:12;20:13;"Maybe 200 there."
20:13;20:15;"Maybe 500."
20:15;20:17;"The Benzer?"
20:17;20:20;"It was like post-Benz, pre-OK Computer."
20:20;20:22;"Life of Pablo Honey?"
20:22;20:25;"Exactly. They were playing OK Computer stuff."
20:25;20:26;"Crazy."
20:26;20:29;"Pablo Honey came from the Jerky Boys, right?"
20:29;20:33;"Was Radiohead named an album after a Jerky Boys reference?"
20:33;20:37;"I would instantly become a Radiohead fan, if that was true."
20:37;20:41;"There was like a popular Jerky Boys prank call that was called Pablo Honey."
20:41;20:42;"Now that rings a bell."
20:42;20:47;"It was an old lady like, ""Pablo Honey, come to Florida. I miss you."""
20:47;20:50;"You know, whatever. I don't know which came first."
20:50;20:52;"Oh my God, we need to find out."
20:52;20:53;"I'm on it."
20:53;20:54;"I was a big Jerky Boys fan."
20:54;20:58;"But anyway, so maybe Radiohead was influenced by Linus Morissette."
20:58;20:59;"Correct."
20:59;21:00;"For real?"
21:00;21:01;"No!"
21:01;21:02;"Sick."
21:02;21:09;"Wait, you're saying the first Radiohead album, Pablo Honey, is named after a Jerky Boys sketch?"
21:09;21:13;"That changes everything about the way I think they think."
21:13;21:14;"I'm like completely--"
21:14;21:16;"And they sample it on the third song."
21:16;21:17;"What?"
21:17;21:18;"Yeah, right."
21:18;21:19;"Wow."
21:19;21:23;"So you're telling me that Tom York and the boys were over there in England--"
21:23;21:24;"This is hilarious."
21:24;21:26;"--listening to the Jerky Boys."
21:26;21:28;"Let's just put that--"
21:28;21:29;"Oh, really?"
21:29;21:32;"Yes, put some respect on the Jerky Boys name."
21:32;21:34;"Wait, do you have Jerky Boys on iTunes?"
21:34;21:35;"There must be, because I feel like--"
21:35;21:37;"This is really turning into a 90s episode."
21:37;21:38;"Play Pablo Honey."
21:38;21:40;"This is an all-male 90s town hall."
21:40;21:51;"For people who don't know, back in the day, in the 90s, basically until the internet really got poppin',"
21:51;21:55;"people could sell millions of records with comedy albums."
21:55;22:02;"Adam Sandler has sold more albums than Spoon, just to put that in perspective."
22:02;22:04;"Oh, that is not surprising."
22:04;22:08;"Okay, Adam Sandler has sold more records than Vampire Weekend."
22:08;22:10;"I guess that's not that surprising either."
22:10;22:13;"But my point is just Adam Sandler has sold a lot of records, and he's just a comedian."
22:13;22:16;"Weird Al, man. Weird Al is crushing."
22:16;22:18;"But at least that's music."
22:18;22:24;"But Jerky Boys, they were basically known for doing prank calls, and they were a huge phenomenon."
22:24;22:27;"So here is the Jerky Boys sketch, Pablo Honey."
22:27;22:31;"Because like we said, was Radiohead influenced by Alanis, or was Alanis influenced by Radiohead?"
22:31;22:36;"I don't know, but one thing we definitely know is that before both of them, it started with the Jerky Boys."
22:36;22:39;"So this is the Jerky Boys with Pablo Honey."
22:39;22:41;"A despot pic."
23:00;23:01;"That's it."
23:01;23:03;"That was so not real."
23:03;23:05;"You should play the frame of Pablo Honey."
23:05;23:06;"That was totally real."
23:06;23:08;"I think that was totally real."
23:08;23:10;"Turn the phones to ""yeah""."
23:10;23:14;"So for all of our younger listeners, that's what music sounded like in the 90s."
23:14;23:15;"Lo-fi."
23:15;23:20;"It was lo-fi, 42 second, kind of atonal stuff."
23:20;23:24;"There were a lot of phones involved."
23:24;23:27;"This is a Radiohead song that sampled it."
23:58;24:00;"When is it going to happen though?"
24:00;24:02;"Yeah, when is the sample?"
24:02;24:03;"Pablo."
24:03;24:18;"Oh, that's so Def Leppard, that change."
24:18;24:20;"Yeah, it is, right?"
24:20;24:27;"Yeah, you know Radiohead were like, when they were kids, were a huge hysteria."
24:27;24:29;"Sounds like it's the change of Panama."
24:29;24:30;"Right."
24:30;24:32;"The Jerky Boys were really racist."
24:32;24:34;"It wouldn't even fly now."
24:34;24:36;"They can't do that now."
24:36;24:39;"They had Saul Rosenberg, that was super anti-Semitic."
24:39;24:40;"Totally."
24:40;24:43;"Then they had that old Spanish lady."
24:43;24:47;"There was the Indian guy who was beating his dog up or whatever."
24:47;24:48;"That guy was ill."
24:48;24:50;"I liked that guy."
24:56;25:12;"Yeah, there it is."
25:12;25:13;"Yeah, I can hear it."
25:13;25:14;"I can barely hear that."
25:14;25:16;"It's under the noise."
25:16;25:17;"It's buried, yeah."
25:17;25:20;"That's also before sampling cost money."
25:20;25:24;"Yeah, I think Radiohead owes the Jerky Boys quite a bit of dough."
25:24;25:26;"May have just f*cked it up for them."
25:26;25:29;"Which member of Radiohead was the big Jerky Boys head?"
25:29;25:35;"Well, that's interesting because people think of Radiohead as being a very self-serious group."
25:35;25:37;"Their music is very kind of dramatic."
25:37;25:41;"Tom York is known to have a very serious kind of cranky demeanor."
25:41;25:43;"He doesn't have a big sense of humor as we recall."
25:43;25:45;"An old-time Crisis favorite."
25:45;25:47;"One time Radiohead was playing in Miami."
25:47;25:51;"And because they have all their weird gear that can sometimes pick up radio signals,"
25:51;25:55;"Bruno Mars started playing through the speakers really loud."
25:55;25:56;"Hey!"
25:56;25:57;"And then what did Tom York say?"
25:57;25:59;"He's just like, ""Oh, f*ck off!"""
25:59;26:00;"""Oh, f*ck off!"""
26:00;26:05;"It seems like Nirvana is not what kicked off the 90s the Jerky Boys are."
26:05;26:06;"But back to Atlantis."
26:06;26:13;"It must have been pretty brutal, as he said, for Radiohead just opening for Atlantis 1996."
26:13;26:16;"Just debuting this long-ass song Paranoid Android."
26:16;26:18;"It's tough to play new songs, period."
26:18;26:20;"Let alone as an opener."
26:20;26:23;"They probably had some hard shows out there and then they went back on the bus."
26:23;26:25;"Was Flea and Adams for Peace?"
26:25;26:26;"Yeah."
26:26;26:27;"Do you think they met on that tour?"
26:27;26:29;"Yo, actually, the more I think about it--"
26:29;26:30;"Tight call, dude."
26:30;26:35;"Actually, the more I think about it, Dev, I think you were right to poke holes in Jake's hypothesis."
26:35;26:37;"What's my hypothesis?"
26:37;26:39;"That Atlantis was influenced by Radiohead."
26:39;26:41;"Clearly, Radiohead was influenced by Atlantis."
26:41;26:42;"That's what I'm saying."
26:43;26:47;"They were opening for her, watching her night after night, stealing her tricks."
26:47;26:53;"Tom York going back to the bus, studying her record, hearing the bass stylings of Flea,"
26:53;26:54;"perhaps for the first time."
26:54;26:57;"And then later on, he poaches Flea for his own band, Adams for Peace."
26:57;27:01;"Took a while, but he got it."
27:01;27:03;"Let me pose this to you."
27:03;27:05;"What's more plausible?"
27:05;27:14;"The support band picks up a few tricks from the headliner, and their next record is their biggest record of all time."
27:14;27:15;"That's right."
27:15;27:19;"Or the headliner picks up a few--I guess both are plausible."
27:19;27:20;"Both are plausible."
27:20;27:25;"Picks up a few tricks from the support act, and her next record is not as big."
27:25;27:26;"Everybody wins on that tour."
27:26;27:28;"I guess those are two classic rock stories."
27:28;27:34;"The hungry up-and-comer gloms onto a bigger artist, steals their tricks, and uses it to greater effect."
27:34;27:35;"That's one story."
27:35;27:39;"And then you also have the big, giant pop star who's worried they're not cool,"
27:39;27:43;"so starts hanging out with a bunch of pasty English weirdos, and is like,"
27:43;27:46;"""You know what? This is going to be a big influence on my next record."""
27:46;27:47;"And then it backfires."
27:47;27:49;"Both are very classic stories in a way."
27:49;27:53;"I stand by thinking Alanis was an influence by Radiohead."
27:53;27:55;"At best, they were drinking from the same well."
27:55;27:58;"You're right. They were probably all listening to Jerky Boys, DJ Shadow."
27:58;27:59;"Oh, God."
27:59;28:03;"Early Joe Rogan experience as well."
28:04;28:07;"Well, yeah, they didn't have podcasts in the '90s,"
28:07;28:11;"but Joe Rogan might have been doing some really low-level stand-up."
28:11;28:12;"Mid-level."
28:12;28:13;"In the '90s?"
28:13;28:14;"Oh, yeah."
28:14;28:17;"I think he was on NewsRadio, too, in that area."
28:17;28:21;"The '90s were really heady times, man."
28:21;28:25;"All right, we're going to take a quick break from the all-male Alanis Town Hall."
28:25;28:29;"We're going to call another guy from London, not George Singleton,"
28:29;28:34;"but an up-and-coming artist who I really like, and his name is Jimothy Lacoste."
28:34;28:38;"And I think you guys are going to be hearing that name a bit more in the future."
28:38;28:41;"He's a young musician making some pretty interesting stuff."
28:41;28:43;"We'll give you a little taste of it, then we'll get him on the phone."

32:18;32:21;"Yay! Life is getting quite exciting."
32:21;32:24;"Is that Timothy Lacoste? Yeah, man."
32:24;32:27;"What's going on? Where are you calling from? London."
32:27;32:30;"So you're born and raised in London?"
32:30;32:33;"Yeah, yeah, I was born and raised in London, North West."
32:33;32:36;"Well, thanks for calling in, man. I really f*** with your music."
32:36;32:39;"You've got a bright future ahead of you. Thank you, bro."
32:39;32:41;"And I want everybody to check it out."
32:41;32:43;"And so you're a city boy. Yeah."
32:43;32:46;"Is that why you made a song about taking the train?"
32:46;32:50;"Yeah, pretty much. I mean, like, you know, I used to always be on trains"
32:50;32:53;"and I've always loved trains and basically, like,"
32:53;32:56;"I'm just, you know, intrigued by subway systems"
32:56;33:00;"and basically inspiration just came out and I started writing"
33:00;33:03;"and I thought this is a pretty good song, you know?"
33:03;33:06;"One thing that I wondered about that is cos in London,"
33:06;33:09;"people usually call it the tube, right? Yeah."
33:09;33:11;"And, you know, like, coming from New York,"
33:11;33:13;"when I first started going to London and stuff,"
33:13;33:17;"I just felt too stupid to have the words ""the tube"" come out of my mouth."
33:17;33:21;"I just couldn't be like, ""Hey, would it save time if I took the tube?"""
33:21;33:24;"It just sounds too stupid for an American person to say."
33:24;33:28;"But then I also felt a little bit stupid, like, on some ugly American shit"
33:28;33:33;"to be like, ""Hey, guys, how long would it take for me to take the subway"
33:33;33:37;"from Camden over to Islington?"""
33:37;33:40;"Like, that sounded funny, too, but you called your song ""Subway System,"""
33:40;33:43;"so are you allowed to say ""subway"" in London?"
33:43;33:45;"Do you know what? You're not."
33:45;33:48;"And when you call it ""subway,"" people will look at you stupid,"
33:48;33:52;"but I guess, like, the reason why I love to call it ""Subway System"""
33:52;33:56;"is cos I'm a big, big fan of the New York City system."
33:56;34:01;"So I like to see the London Underground trains more as subways"
34:01;34:03;"cos it's like--it's the same thing."
34:03;34:05;"I prefer calling it subways. Calling it ""tube"" sounds weird."
34:05;34:07;"I mean, I get why it's kind of called ""tube"""
34:07;34:10;"cos in a way, the train there, you know, the trains here,"
34:10;34:13;"they look like tubes, and the tunnels look like tubes."
34:13;34:15;"The tunnels, yeah, are more circular."
34:15;34:18;"Yeah, so I get why, but I don't know."
34:18;34:20;"I just rather call it ""subway,"" really."
34:20;34:22;"It sounds more funny, you know?"
34:22;34:26;"I like the way--the word ""subway"" sounds funny and interesting."
34:26;34:28;"And then also there's, like, the Sandwich Place,"
34:28;34:31;"which is a hilarious chain restaurant."
34:31;34:34;"Now I'm with you. Maybe you could start the wave so that--"
34:34;34:36;"now when American people go to London,"
34:36;34:38;"they don't have to feel embarrassed to say ""subway."""
34:38;34:42;"Exactly, man. I am gonna start the wave. I am. Definitely, man."
34:42;34:45;"I actually--I remember, I think a year ago,"
34:45;34:48;"I actually told myself, ""Do you know what?"
34:48;34:51;"""I'm gonna call the tube now 'subway' for now on."""
34:51;34:54;"And I tried to, and I failed a lot of times."
34:54;34:56;"I kept forgetting to call it, but, you know,"
34:56;34:58;"I'm definitely calling it that now, you know, so..."
34:58;35:00;"Well, you put the song out."
35:00;35:02;"You've kind of, like, staked your reputation on it a little bit."
35:02;35:04;"No, definitely."
35:04;35:07;"# What am I gonna do on Monday?"
35:07;35:11;"# Monday boy, I'm finna get ES paid"
35:11;35:16;"# Schedule's getting busy, might have to hire a maid"
35:16;35:20;"# Life is getting quite exciting"

35:46;35:50;"# Maybe hit a motive if the sky is grey"
35:50;35:55;"# Or just meet girls and just say hey"
35:55;35:59;"# I'm a busy, friendly guy"
35:59;36:03;"# So I will say hey but say goodbye"
36:03;36:05;"# Cos my schedule is packed"
36:05;36:08;"# And I've got things to go through"
36:08;36:10;"# But hang on, wait"
36:10;36:13;"# This Monday I've got nothing to do"
36:13;36:17;"# So let's meet up and have some good times"
36:17;36:22;"# We can eat some pizza while we listen to Michael Rhymes"
36:22;36:26;"# I love the new me, this ain't no conspiracy"
36:26;36:30;"# See, when I walk down the road it feels like I'm in luxury"
36:30;36:33;"# What am I gonna do on Monday?"
36:33;36:39;"# Monday, Monday boy, I'm finna get ES paid"
36:39;36:43;"# Schedule's getting busy, might have to hire a maid"
36:43;36:47;"# Life is getting quite exciting"
36:47;36:52;"# Damn, it's amazing how good you feel"
36:52;36:56;"So you have a song called Drugs in which you say,"
36:56;36:59;"""Xannies are the number one thing I hate."
36:59;37:02;"""I thought all the young people loved Xanax, but not really."
37:02;37:04;"""It's controversial."""
37:04;37:08;"I think Xans basically started in 2016"
37:08;37:11;"and they're slightly ending in 2018."
37:11;37:14;"I know a lot of people by the end of 2017"
37:14;37:16;"they were pretty much saying no to Xans."
37:16;37:19;"A lot of young people my age also stopped doing Xans"
37:19;37:22;"and a lot of them tried to and a lot of them realised it was bad,"
37:22;37:25;"but I don't think they realised how bad it actually was."
37:25;37:29;"A lot of them still do it, but I think it is slowing down, which is good."
37:29;37:33;"Right, it's out there killing people, so you have to be very careful with it."
37:33;37:36;"When I first tried it when I was younger,"
37:36;37:40;"straight away I thought, ""Hang on, there's something not right about this."""
37:40;37:44;"I did my research, like I always do, and then, boom,"
37:44;37:49;"I realised, ""No, no, no, no, this is legit the worst thing in the world."""
37:49;37:52;"And then I just never touched that **** again."
37:52;37:54;"- Oh, good for you. - Yeah, man."
37:54;37:58;"# Girl, why you gotta do so many drugs"
37:58;38:00;"# Many drugs"
38:00;38:04;"# Take it easy with your drugs or it can be a loss"
38:04;38:08;"# You can be my pretty little darling Kate Moss"
38:08;38:13;"# But take it easy with your drugs or it could be a loss"
38:13;38:15;"# You're getting wrinkles"
38:15;38:18;"# You're looking dry"
38:18;38:23;"# Baby, take it easy, stop getting high"
38:23;38:26;"# Yes, I know things get boring"
38:26;38:30;"# But here's an idea, grab a pen and start drawing"
38:30;38:34;"# Another idea, drink some water in the morning"
38:34;38:38;"# Or help your dad with some heavy-duty soaring"
38:38;38:41;"# Cos it's healthy for your brain"
38:41;38:43;"# Discover it differently"
38:43;38:47;"# Get lost in your thoughts like water down a drain"
38:47;38:52;"# So get a little hobby, give meaning to your life"
38:52;38:56;"# Then 10 to 15 years you could be a healthy, happy wife"
38:56;39:00;"# You can't be doing more drugs than Kate Moss"
39:00;39:05;"# That's how I know you're heading for a crazy loss"
39:05;39:08;"# Why you gotta do so many drugs"
39:08;39:10;"# Many drugs"
39:10;39:14;"# Take it easy with your drugs or it can be a loss"
39:14;39:18;"# You can be my pretty little darling Kate Moss"
39:18;39:23;"# But take it easy with your drugs or it could be a loss"
39:23;39:25;"# People getting waived"
39:25;39:27;"# People getting wavy"

39:32;39:36;"# You don't know what to do anymore"
39:36;39:40;"# Maybe cos your thoughts and hobby's getting poor"
39:40;39:42;"# You need a quick restore"
39:42;39:44;"# But take your time"
39:44;39:48;"# If you end up brushing you could fall in the slime"
39:48;39:52;"# So go and live your young years now"
39:52;39:55;"# But watch out, take your time"
39:55;39:58;"# Or you could just end up shouting out"
39:58;40:00;"# From your poor little liver"
40:00;40:05;"# All that cake and that speed gave you a sick little fever"
40:05;40:09;"# If your man is a dick, then he might just leave ya"
40:09;40:13;"# Everyone slightly worried, even your bloody dealer"

40:22;40:24;"# Even your bloody dealer"
40:24;40:26;"# Even your bloody dealer #"
40:26;40:28;"So what's next for Jimothee Lacoste?"
40:28;40:32;"I mean, like, are you trying to, like, go full-time music, world tour?"
40:32;40:35;"Definitely. OK. Definitely."
40:35;40:37;"If I don't do that, I'll be quite upset."
40:37;40:39;"I'll never quit, but I would be quite upset."
40:39;40:42;"But that's 100% the plan, and that is what's going to happen."
40:42;40:46;"Basically, my main goal is to just keep doing me, basically."
40:46;40:49;"I mean, I've seen some footage of some of your shows in London."
40:49;40:52;"It looked like things were... Looked some good energy over there."
40:52;40:54;"Yeah, man, yeah."
40:54;40:57;"The energy over here is pretty good. It's pretty sick."
40:57;41:02;"I always try and get my fans to really, you know, get hyper"
41:02;41:07;"and to really get in the vibe and to feel really good at my shows, you know?"
41:07;41:09;"So I've just got one more question."
41:09;41:12;"I'm just curious about, like, your music's very unique."
41:12;41:14;"That's why I gravitate towards it."
41:14;41:16;"Do you consider yourself a rapper?"
41:16;41:18;"I wouldn't consider myself a rapper"
41:18;41:21;"because as soon as you're then labelled as a rapper,"
41:21;41:25;"I think a lot of people then no longer have respect for you."
41:25;41:27;"A lot of people no longer have respect for you,"
41:27;41:29;"so I wouldn't really consider myself a rapper."
41:29;41:30;"But..."
41:30;41:33;"In 2018, there's still people who don't respect rap music?"
41:33;41:37;"Yeah, I mean, like, any 40-year-old or 50-year-old,"
41:37;41:39;"like, a posh man from England,"
41:39;41:43;"if you say to him, ""What's the first thing that comes up in your mind"
41:43;41:45;"""when you hear 'rapper'?"""
41:45;41:48;"It's only going to be negativity, man, and I'm not..."
41:48;41:51;"I think Kanye West actually said it a long time ago."
41:51;41:54;"He said he doesn't want to be labelled as a rapper"
41:54;41:57;"because as soon as he's labelled as a rapper,"
41:57;42:00;"then all this negativity comes on, and it's so true,"
42:00;42:02;"and people then just don't give you a chance."
42:02;42:04;"But I rhyme my words, you know?"
42:04;42:07;"I make people jump and I like to dance,"
42:07;42:11;"and honestly, I think when hip-hop actually first started in the '70s,"
42:11;42:13;"that's actually what it was, man,"
42:13;42:17;"and I actually discovered that, honestly, the day...like, yesterday."
42:17;42:19;"You know the song, the..."
42:19;42:22;"- Oh, yeah. - I was listening to that,"
42:22;42:24;"and I thought to myself, ""Cool, cool."""
42:24;42:27;"So, like, the beat is kind of housey, like, my beats."
42:27;42:29;"He's basically just making everyone dance,"
42:29;42:31;"and he's dancing, and he's just there,"
42:31;42:33;"and it's like, that is what hip-hop was."
42:33;42:36;"And then, of course, it developed into, you know,"
42:36;42:39;"talking about struggling in life and blah, blah, blah."
42:39;42:41;"Now it's developed into, like, more..."
42:41;42:44;"Honestly, man, I'm going to get hate for this,"
42:44;42:48;"but I think it's now developed into what it used to be back in the '70s,"
42:48;42:51;"which is making people dance, making people hype, happy,"
42:51;42:54;"and just turn, like it used to in the '70s, you know?"
42:54;42:57;"But, I mean, I can't really say I'm hip-hop."
42:57;42:59;"I honestly say this."
42:59;43:02;"I reckon, if you think I'm hip-hop, I'm hip-hop, you know?"
43:02;43:04;"If not, then I'm not,"
43:04;43:07;"but you can label me anything you want, really."
43:07;43:08;"All right, I feel that."
43:08;43:11;"Well, thank you to Jimothee Lacoste for calling in,"
43:11;43:13;"and, yeah, we can't wait to see what you do next, man."
43:13;43:14;"We appreciate it."
43:14;43:16;"Thank you, bro, thank you."
43:16;43:17;"Have a good one."
43:17;43:18;"You too, bro, le quai."
43:18;43:22;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
43:22;43:24;"Beats 1."
43:24;43:30;"# I said a hip-hop, a hippity, a hippity, a hip-hip-hop"
43:30;43:33;"# You don't stop, rock it out, baby, ba-ba-ba"
43:33;43:36;"# To the boogity, bang-bang, the boogity, the boogity beat"
43:36;43:38;"# Now, what you hear is not a test"
43:38;43:40;"# I'm rappin' to the beat"
43:40;43:42;"# And me, the groove, and my friends"
43:42;43:44;"# Are gonna try to move your feet"
43:44;43:46;"# You see, I am Wonder Mike"
43:46;43:48;"# And I like to say hello"
43:48;43:51;"# Up to the black, to the white, the red and the brown"
43:51;43:52;"# The purple and yellow"
43:52;43:55;"# But first I gotta bang-bang the boogity, the boogity"
43:55;43:57;"# Say up-jump the boogity, the bang-bang, boogity"
43:57;44:00;"# Let's rock, you don't stop"
44:00;44:02;"# Rock the rhythm and I'll make your body rock"
44:02;44:04;"So thank you to Jimothee Lacoste."
44:04;44:07;"Dev, do you think it's weird for a UK musician"
44:07;44:10;"to write a song about underground transportation"
44:10;44:12;"and call it Subway System?"
44:12;44:14;"Um... London."
44:14;44:16;"Now, you're somebody... You were born and raised in London."
44:16;44:17;"Yeah."
44:17;44:19;"And then, at this point, you probably lived in New York"
44:19;44:20;"almost as long as..."
44:20;44:22;"Well, you've lived in New York a long time."
44:22;44:23;"Yeah."
44:23;44:24;"Maybe not as long."
44:24;44:26;"But you've lived in New York a long time, so..."
44:26;44:28;"Well, my entire 20s was in New York."
44:28;44:31;"Right. In London, you take the Tube,"
44:31;44:32;"and in New York, you take the Subway."
44:32;44:33;"Yes."
44:33;44:36;"Is his name really Jimothee, or did he make that up?"
44:36;44:37;"I think his real name's Timothy."
44:37;44:38;"Yeah."
44:38;44:40;"But he wanted to spice things up."
44:40;44:42;"And he just said that he admires the New York system,"
44:42;44:43;"so he likes to call it Subway."
44:43;44:46;"But when you go back to London, would you ever call it the Subway?"
44:46;44:47;"No."
44:47;44:49;"It's just as bad as calling it the Tube in New York."
44:49;44:50;"It's actually worse."
44:50;44:51;"Oh, it's worse? Why?"
44:51;45:00;"Yeah. England's a bit tougher about those little switches and mistakes."
45:00;45:03;"Is it because people are shocked that you said something incorrect,"
45:03;45:07;"or is it like, ""Oh, look at you. Here comes Mr. New York""?"
45:07;45:08;"[laughter]"
45:08;45:09;"As they call me."
45:09;45:10;"Yeah."
45:10;45:12;"[laughter]"
45:12;45:14;"""Hey, it's Johnny New York."""
45:14;45:18;"[laughter]"
45:18;45:20;"Because I feel like in America, people would actually find it charming."
45:20;45:21;"Well, that's the difference, though."
45:21;45:22;"Yeah."
45:22;45:24;"Because people like English people more than Americans."
45:24;45:25;"Right."
45:25;45:26;"[laughter]"
45:26;45:27;"It's as simple as that."
45:27;45:28;"It's basically--"
45:28;45:32;"So recently, Seinfeld 2000, who's our social media manager"
45:32;45:36;"and is eventually going to transition to being our warehouse manager--"
45:36;45:37;"Oh, yeah."
45:37;45:39;"--once we start shipping some of our merchandise--"
45:39;45:40;"That's true."
45:40;45:46;"--you opened the floor to the Twitter followers of Time Crisis 2000,"
45:46;45:48;"the Twitter account that you manage."
45:48;45:51;"The recently verified Twitter account that I manage."
45:51;45:53;"By the way, how are things going with that account?"
45:53;45:59;"I don't go on Twitter much anymore, and I've really left an important thing in your care."
45:59;46:01;"Yeah. We're really popping off."
46:01;46:03;"We're almost at 8,000 Twitter followers."
46:03;46:04;"That seems low."
46:04;46:05;"Well--"
46:05;46:08;"How many Twitter followers does the Seinfeld 2000 account have?"
46:08;46:12;"That has 191,000 Twitter followers."
46:12;46:13;"That's so much more."
46:13;46:16;"Well, I've been doing that for like five years."
46:16;46:18;"You've been doing this for like four years."
46:18;46:19;"No."
46:19;46:23;"Wait, but are you bringing your A-game stuff to the Seinfeld one?"
46:23;46:25;"Never really."
46:25;46:29;"Next time you think of some funny, imaginative Seinfeld-type thing,"
46:29;46:31;"just put it right on the Time Crisis one."
46:31;46:34;"Just straight up Seinfeld? I do it sometimes."
46:34;46:35;"Okay."
46:35;46:36;"All right."
46:36;46:38;"Have we had any viral tweets?"
46:38;46:39;"Define viral."
46:39;46:43;"You know, like you take the yodeling kid and you put a beat behind it."
46:43;46:47;"Is that the game you want me to be playing on this Twitter account,"
46:47;46:49;"like pandering to the viral moments?"
46:49;46:50;"Yeah."
46:50;46:52;"I wanted something with the yodeling kid."
46:52;46:53;"You want more yodel content?"
46:53;46:57;"Like did you do anything about like, oh, that feel when you get to Coachella?"
46:57;46:59;"Or something?"
46:59;47:01;"Because it was just Coachella."
47:01;47:02;"That doesn't sound too great to me."
47:02;47:05;"Next time Donald Trump says some dumb [bleep]"
47:05;47:08;"I want you to tweet at him, ""You, sir, are a disgrace."""
47:08;47:11;"I mean, that's going to go everywhere."
47:11;47:13;"That's going to be on BuzzFeed."
47:13;47:14;"Will that go viral?"
47:14;47:16;"I think that's going to be a big one."
47:16;47:18;"It would go viral if you did it with every single tweet."
47:18;47:20;"Okay, yeah, we got to make it--"
47:20;47:22;"Consistency can create virality."
47:22;47:23;"It's a deal."
47:23;47:26;"Oh, and like did Bernie Sanders said something about Cardi B?"
47:26;47:28;"Yeah, I just retweeted Bernie."
47:28;47:30;"Yeah, but then he gets the retweets."
47:30;47:33;"You got to Photoshop Bernie's head onto Cardi's body or something like that."
47:33;47:34;"Oh, you know what?"
47:34;47:36;"Also, next time there's like a big viral tweet,"
47:36;47:38;"I'm talking like a 10,000, 15,000 tweet,"
47:38;47:41;"screenshot that and then just write like,"
47:41;47:45;"""Up top, love this tweet. Crying, laughing, face emoji."""
47:45;47:46;"That was pretty good."
47:46;47:48;"But so meanwhile, Cardi B and Bernie Sanders are going viral"
47:48;47:51;"and Time Crisis 2000 has 8,000 followers."
47:51;47:53;"Well, Jake only has 3,000 followers."
47:53;47:55;"I don't even have 3,000. 2,500."
47:55;47:59;"Why don't you just come up with something that Time Crisis really loves"
47:59;48:01;"that people are going to get excited about,"
48:01;48:03;"the way Cardi B loves presidents."
48:03;48:07;"I mean, people who love Time Crisis have very eclectic tastes."
48:07;48:10;"They like old rock music and like--"
48:10;48:12;"Corporate food history."
48:12;48:16;"Corporate food history doesn't always cross over with the viral moments of the day."
48:16;48:19;"So I'm trying to appeal to that audience as well."
48:19;48:21;"I'm spending a lot of plates here."
48:21;48:23;"Okay, I got an idea."
48:23;48:26;"We just zero in on one of the big accounts."
48:26;48:31;"I'm talking like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, 100 million followers."
48:31;48:33;"When you say zero in, what do you mean?"
48:33;48:37;"For this fiscal quarter, we just lock onto them."
48:37;48:42;"Every time they tweet, we hit them with a ""I'm a big fan. Can I get a follow back?"""
48:42;48:43;"Sure."
48:43;48:46;"Because that's--"
48:46;48:49;"No, and I'm not talking once. That's what I mean by zero in."
48:49;48:52;"I'm saying Justin Bieber, he tweets anything."
48:52;48:56;"I want Time Crisis 2000 tweeting at him, ""Justin, I'm a big fan."
48:56;48:58;"Please, can I get a follow back?"""
48:58;49:00;"Because persistence pays off."
49:00;49:02;"I mean, it sounds a little thirsty to me, but--"
49:02;49:07;"And then you can add to your bio, ""Justin Bieber follows"" once you get the follow."
49:07;49:10;"And you write the date that he followed."
49:10;49:16;"Wait, because sometimes when a big account follows a nobody, people will be like, ""What's going on here?"""
49:16;49:22;"I think we're looking at this the wrong way, because I'm in a room full of people who work with people who have tens of millions of followers."
49:22;49:24;"Who work with them."
49:24;49:27;"I'm saying, like, ""Ariel, can you reach out to Usher?"""
49:27;49:29;"You could DM him."
49:29;49:32;"I have DM capabilities with Usher."
49:32;49:36;"You DM Usher, you say, ""Look, can I get a follow back?"""
49:36;49:38;"Can I get a follow back? Can you retweet?"
49:38;49:40;"Let's really break this down."
49:40;49:44;"Because honestly, if Usher followed Time Crisis 2000, that'd be huge."
49:44;49:46;"Oh, yeah, it would be--"
49:46;49:49;"No, you don't understand. It'd be massive."
49:49;49:51;"I don't even know how we could top that."
49:51;49:53;"It would be gigante."
50:10;50:12;"What's a cool way--"
50:12;50:14;"Yeah, give me the pitch."
50:14;50:21;"If you're forcing a producer to reach out to somebody that he knows, but doesn't talk to regularly,"
50:21;50:24;"what's the cool way for him to DM Usher?"
50:24;50:31;"What's the cool way to say, ""Listen, my friend's got this account,"" and it would just be so amazing if you followed?"
50:31;50:34;"""Hey, what's up? Exclamation mark. It's me, Ariel, from work."""
50:34;50:36;"Wait, how come it's not a question mark?"
50:36;50:41;"Well, it's conveying a certain level of enthusiasm to get him energized."
50:41;50:42;"From work, did you say?"
50:42;50:43;"Yeah."
50:43;50:45;"[Laughter]"
50:45;50:47;"Well, they've worked together."
50:47;50:48;"That's fair, because they work together."
50:48;50:50;"""Hey, it's me, Ariel, from work."""
50:50;50:51;"I was making sure I heard you."
50:51;50:54;"I wouldn't make the demand in the first tweet."
50:54;50:55;"I would just say, you know, I'd leave it open."
50:55;50:57;"""Hey, it's me, Ariel, from work."""
50:57;50:59;"Let's say 10 minutes later--"
50:59;51:00;"[Laughter]"
51:00;51:05;"You could even list some of the songs that you've done together just to get it fresh in his mind."
51:05;51:07;"And then he goes, ""Hey, what would he say?"""
51:07;51:08;"""What up, man?"""
51:08;51:09;"Right."
51:09;51:11;"[Laughter]"
51:11;51:13;"Oh, well, because that's a question. ""What up?"""
51:13;51:18;"So when somebody asks you a question, you're allowed to answer, and that's not considered thirsty to answer somebody's question."
51:18;51:19;"That's what I'm saying."
51:19;51:21;"Yeah, since--well, as a matter of fact, since you asked."
51:21;51:22;"[Laughter]"
51:22;51:27;"My friends have an internet radio show called ""Time Crisis,"" and the account is not doing so hot."
51:27;51:30;"Oh, well, I mean, it sounds a little sad if you put it that way."
51:30;51:33;"I would go, you know, I'd go, ""Hey, you know Azra, right?"""
51:33;51:35;"""We're just on our social game."""
51:35;51:36;"That's--something like that."
51:36;51:38;"And what if he writes back, ""No""?"
51:38;51:40;"I think he'd be lying, no?"
51:40;51:41;"You know Azra Kane--"
51:41;51:43;"Okay, so if he writes back, ""No,"" then say, like, ""Why are you lying?"""
51:43;51:45;"I would send, like, a picture of you."
51:45;51:48;"No, you send that meme, the ""Why are you always lying?"""
51:48;51:49;"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
51:49;51:50;"Or, like, the thinking guy."
51:50;51:51;"Yeah, yeah, that guy."
51:51;51:53;"Yeah, I mean, I guess that would work."
51:53;51:54;"Just to show that we mean business."
51:54;51:55;"That's right."
51:55;51:56;"I think you just go with the flow."
51:56;51:58;"I don't think you can plan these things out too much."
51:58;52:02;"And then you ask for a retweet, or you ask for a shout-out or something, and, you know,"
52:02;52:03;"you can say, ""It's on Apple."
52:03;52:05;"We can offer you some money."""
52:05;52:07;"[Laughter]"
52:07;52:09;"Like, as an influencer type of fee?"
52:09;52:10;"Like, you know."
52:10;52:11;"Yeah, there's a budget for that, right?"
52:11;52:12;"I don't know if you have to talk to Apple."
52:12;52:16;"Wait, maybe we should--maybe we're shooting too high with, like, the real celebrities."
52:16;52:17;"Yeah."
52:17;52:18;"Maybe the jerky boys."
52:18;52:19;"[Laughter]"
52:19;52:20;"I was just on their Instagram."
52:20;52:22;"They have, like, 5,000 followers."
52:22;52:23;"Wow."
52:23;52:25;"And I'm worse than--well."
52:25;52:26;"I mean, it's still respectable."
52:26;52:27;"Yeah."
52:27;52:29;"I mean, I guess every little bit counts."
52:29;52:31;"All right, look, Seinfeld, I don't care how you do it."
52:31;52:35;"We just came up with about five great ideas, but just get those numbers up, man."
52:35;52:36;"All right."
52:36;52:37;"I'm on it."
52:37;52:39;"I mean, it might take me a couple years, but--"
52:39;52:42;"Because long-term, I want to sell this show to Wendy's."
52:42;52:47;"And when you go into a big corporate office and you're trying to sell something,"
52:47;52:49;"they want to see assets, what they're buying."
52:49;52:54;"And I can't just go in and say, ""You get kind of, you know, interesting back and forth"
52:54;52:56;"between me and Jake about this and that."""
52:56;52:58;"They'll say, ""Why do I want to buy that?"""
52:58;53:00;"But numbers."
53:00;53:04;"If I can say to them and I say, ""How does 15,000 followers on Twitter--?"""
53:04;53:05;"Right."
53:05;53:07;"They're going to want, like, half a million to a million."
53:07;53:09;"You've got, like, half a million, right?"
53:09;53:11;"Yeah, and declining."
53:11;53:13;"And how often do you shout out the Time Crisis Twitter account?"
53:13;53:16;"Like, how much do you promote your own show on your own Twitter?"
53:16;53:19;"I think I've done it at least four or five times."
53:19;53:21;"All right, so you can count it on one hand."
53:21;53:24;"Anyway."
53:24;53:28;"So using this pitiful Twitter account, you put out an APB saying--"
53:28;53:29;"I did."
53:29;53:30;"What did you say?"
53:30;53:37;"What I said was, ""Crisis crew, we are doing our first-ever Time Crisis AMA on the next show."
53:37;53:42;"Tweet us all your questions for Ezra, Jake, and me @Seinfeld2000 by Wednesday, and who knows?"
53:42;53:45;"Maybe we'll answer you on the Time Crisis No Vampire Weekend questions."
53:45;53:47;"Just kidding."
53:47;53:49;"Add a little levity at the end."""
53:49;53:55;"So it's another Time Crisis thing that you left me and Cousin Asher off with."
53:55;53:57;"[laughter]"
53:57;53:59;"Tweet all your questions."
53:59;54:01;"It doesn't matter if I'm going to be here or not."
54:01;54:02;"I'm a member of this team."
54:02;54:04;"I feel like I'm shouting you out, like, nonstop on that account,"
54:04;54:06;"which is probably why it's not that popular."
54:06;54:08;"[laughter]"
54:08;54:10;"But I mean, I haven't gotten any more followers."
54:10;54:11;"Well, neither did Jake."
54:11;54:13;"Look, we've got a problem here with the--"
54:13;54:14;"but you know what?"
54:14;54:17;"I think what we have here is a problem with Twitter as a problematic platform,"
54:17;54:19;"and that's really what I want to talk about today."
54:19;54:20;"Is Twitter dying?"
54:20;54:22;"I heard it was dead, and then it came back."
54:22;54:24;"When did it come back?"
54:24;54:25;"Kanye got back on."
54:25;54:27;"Oh, yeah, Kanye got back on."
54:27;54:28;"Donald J. Trump."
54:28;54:31;"And I think Donald Trump, because whether you like him or you hate him,"
54:31;54:33;"you've got to be on Twitter to engage with him."
54:33;54:35;"Dev got back on Twitter."
54:35;54:36;"Oh, Dev got back on Twitter."
54:36;54:37;"Oh, yeah, by the way, Dev."
54:37;54:38;"I did, actually."
54:38;54:40;"Before we get into this AMA, how's it going?"
54:40;54:43;"How are you feeling being back in the [bleep]?"
54:43;54:46;"I'm back in the [bleep] after a three-year absence."
54:46;54:48;"Yeah, it's okay."
54:48;54:49;"I'm sticking to business."
54:49;54:51;"I'm being very transparent."
54:51;54:55;"I'm back strictly for campaign of album number four."
54:55;54:56;"Right."
54:56;54:58;"But I like the straightforwardness."
56:56;56:59;"What's some wild [bleep] you would say hypothetically if you were just going off?"
56:59;57:00;"Can we workshop?"
57:00;57:08;"I consider that, you know, thinking of some, like, really not funny Morrissey jokes."
57:08;57:09;"Like roasting Morrissey?"
57:09;57:10;"Yeah."
57:10;57:11;"Making fun of Morrissey?"
57:11;57:14;"But, like, in a really, like, the most obvious ways that could happen."
57:14;57:16;"I'm really into that lately."
57:16;57:20;"I had a night recently with friends, and we spent the whole night doing every worst catchphrase"
57:20;57:23;"you could ever think of."
57:23;57:24;"Like making up your own?"
57:24;57:25;"No, no, just--"
57:25;57:26;"Yeah, yeah, baby."
57:26;57:27;"Exactly."
57:27;57:28;"All of that."
57:28;57:30;"We did all of those for, like, five hours."
57:30;57:32;"I've been waiting for Austin Powers to come back."
57:32;57:33;"I think it's now."
57:33;57:34;"Oh, really?"
57:34;57:35;"Finally."
57:35;57:36;"I think it's right now."
57:36;57:37;"That's a good catchphrase, though."
57:37;57:38;"Yeah, baby."
57:38;57:39;"In my belly."
57:39;57:40;"Like that one."
57:40;57:41;"Yeah."
57:41;57:42;"I've been doing all of those."
57:42;57:43;"Sometimes--"
57:43;57:44;"Oh, my God."
57:44;57:47;"When those movies first came out, we were all pretty young."
57:47;57:49;"They seemed very funny."
57:49;57:52;"But similar to Borat, my wife--"
57:52;57:53;"Yep, that's the other one."
57:53;57:54;"Now what's happening?"
57:54;57:58;"Borat and Austin Powers, those catchphrases almost, like, make you sick now."
57:58;57:59;"Yeah."
57:59;58:02;"A lot of people forget that Beyonce was in the third Austin Powers movie."
58:02;58:03;"Oh, yeah, Fox and Cleopatra."
58:03;58:04;"I love--"
58:04;58:06;"Wait, wait, there's a third Austin Powers movie?"
58:06;58:07;"Yeah, Goldmember."
58:08;58:09;"Starring Beyonce."
58:10;58:11;"When is that?"
58:11;58:12;"Is that, like, 2002 or something?"
58:12;58:15;"And actually, a lot of people thought that--you know, people were speculating about her big"
58:15;58:16;"Coachella performance."
58:16;58:21;"I saw a lot of disappointment that she didn't bring Mike Myers out as Austin Powers."
58:21;58:24;"Because that would have been very meaningful to the fans."
58:24;58:29;"Wait, wait, I don't want to break this down because, you know, as an English person, that"
58:29;58:35;"movie wasn't as important for me as it was for, I think, everyone in this room."
58:35;58:38;"And so my memory is hazy."
58:38;58:44;"What is the plot of one, and what was the extension that graduated with two?"
58:44;58:45;"Was two the Madonna song?"
58:45;58:46;"I want to drop a bomb."
58:46;58:48;"[explosion]"
58:48;58:53;"Time crisis takes two hours to explain the entire plot of Austin Powers 1 through 3."
58:53;58:54;"Okay, I need to know."
58:54;58:55;"I really am curious."
58:55;59:02;"The basic plot of Austin Powers is that he was a groovy '60s man about town, James Bond"
59:02;59:08;"type guy who got frozen in time and then comes back in the late '90s."
59:08;59:10;"It actually is about PC culture a little bit."
59:10;59:11;"Oh, it takes place in the '90s."
59:11;59:17;"So he was frozen and then he becomes unfrozen and then he finds that some of his misogynistic"
59:17;59:23;"'60s antics don't fly in the marginally less misogynistic late '90s."
59:23;59:24;"Kind of amazing."
59:24;59:28;"And so Elizabeth Hurley teaches him a little bit about the things he missed out on, and"
59:28;59:32;"then he has to fight his nemesis who's still alive, Dr. Evil."
59:32;59:33;"Dr. Evil."
59:33;59:35;"Okay, and so was Mini-Me in two?"
59:35;59:37;"Was that the graduation?"
59:37;59:39;"Yeah, Mini-Me, I think, appeared in two."
59:39;59:41;"And Fat Bastard is in..."
59:41;59:42;"Which had America dying."
59:42;59:44;"And then Fat Bastard, I believe, was in three."
59:44;59:46;"No, I think Fat Bastard was in two and three."
59:46;59:47;"Mini-Fat Bastard was in two and three."
59:47;59:49;"And Beyonce is in three."
59:49;59:51;"Okay, and Madonna did the music for..."
59:51;59:53;"She had a hit song on the one."
59:53;59:55;"That was the first one?"
59:55;59:56;"I believe so, Beautiful Stranger."
59:56;01:00:01;"So people were just thinking, like, damn, Mark Myers, post-Wayne's World, this is going"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"to be huge."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"And it was."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"Well, yeah, he had a misstep with So I Married an Axe Murderer in between."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"Oh, that's a good one."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"In between Wayne's World."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"That's great."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"But a lot of people forget, the thing people forget about Mike Myers, there's only so many"
01:00:14;01:00:19;"actors or actresses who have ever been part of multiple gigantic franchises."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"And Mr. Myers has under his belt Wayne's World."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"Correct."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"Austin Powers."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Correct."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"And Shrek."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"Correct."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"The biggest of all."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"Well, anyway, if you want to see Mike Myers and Beyonce get back together, whether it's"
01:00:31;01:00:36;"on her forthcoming tour, or maybe even on a track, or maybe in another film, tweet at"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"us, and maybe we could start a petition or something to get that going."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"This is crazy."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"Wait, what?"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Oh, the poster."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Jessica Alba."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Jessica Alba, yeah."
01:00:45;01:00:50;"Is your takeaway, Dev, being an Englishman, that Mike Myers was never funny?"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"No, I loved Wayne's World."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Yeah."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Loved Wayne's World."
01:00:54;01:00:59;"But Austin Powers reeks of when people realize they can do good English accents."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Yeah, yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"And then he got a budget for it."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"I'm gonna have to stop."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"Yeah, baby."
01:01:10;01:01:21;"Also, it's like, the late 90s was the last time it was remotely cool to be like, into"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"the 60s."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Yeah."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Like, it's-"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"What?"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"It's not cool to be into the 60s anymore."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Well, no, now it's back again, I think."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"Wait, it's cool to be in the 60s again?"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Via the 90s, 'cause the 90s are back."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Ah, via the 90s, okay."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"I've been in my whole life."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Fair enough."
01:01:38;01:01:43;"No, but I'm just saying, in terms of youth culture, like, I just feel like swinging 60s"
01:01:43;01:01:49;"stuff, I could see via the lens of the 90s, but that was the last time it was, like, really"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"cool."
01:01:50;01:01:54;"Take the last train to Clarksville and I'll meet you at the station."
01:01:54;01:01:59;"You can be here by 4.30 'cause I've made your reservation."
01:01:59;01:02:02;"Don't be slow."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:07;01:02:12;"'Cause I'm leaving in the morning and I must see you again."
01:02:12;01:02:19;"We'll have one more night together 'til the morning brings my train and I must go."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:24;01:02:31;"And I don't know if I'm ever coming home."
01:02:31;01:02:36;"Take the last train to Clarksville, I'll be waiting at the station."
01:02:36;01:02:43;"We'll have time for coffee, for later kisses, and a bit of conversation."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"Oh no, no, no."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Okay, so Seinfeld, you got a few questions."
01:02:50;01:02:55;"Let's go through and I know these are directed at us, but maybe some of our panel can help"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"out too."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"Lightning round."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Let's do a lightning round."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Keep these answers short and sweet."
01:03:00;01:03:06;"All right, Jaideep Rao asks, ""Best fast food milkshake?"""
01:03:06;01:03:07;"Go."
01:03:07;01:03:11;"It's been a minute, but in my memory, Jack in the Box."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"Wow."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Oreo cookie milkshake."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"I thought the obvious answer was McDonald's."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"I thought everybody was just gonna--"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"I've had McDonald's milkshakes the most, because growing up, that was the fast food establishment"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I frequented the most often."
01:03:24;01:03:28;"But even as a kid, I remember drinking the McDonald's milkshakes and feeling like, ""This"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"doesn't really taste like chocolate."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"This isn't good."""
01:03:31;01:03:33;"Crazy thing about the McDonald's ones is they weren't cold."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Right."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"And then when I saw that movie--"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"The Founder."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"And it blew my f***ing mind."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Yeah, because they're not ice cream."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"Yeah, it blew my mind."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"I was like, ""Oh my God."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"I always noticed that they weren't cold."""
01:03:44;01:03:47;"They were saving money by not using actual ice cream, because then they didn't have to"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"have a freezer on site."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"All right, next question."
01:03:51;01:03:59;"Becca Renton asks, ""Are Lunchables charcuterie?"""
01:03:59;01:04:01;"That's a great question."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"I mean, that question is just a work of art in and of itself."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"I mean, I think the answer is no."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"I mean, you could twist yourself."
01:04:08;01:04:14;"If you're the type of person who, at 1 AM, you're leaving the bar, and somebody says,"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"""See you tomorrow, Frank."""
01:04:15;01:04:17;"And you say, ""Don't you mean today?"""
01:04:17;01:04:20;"Like, you could be technically right, but you're all--you know."
01:04:20;01:04:23;"But people hate that s***."
01:04:23;01:04:30;"So if--because in America, when we say charcuterie, we mean a kind of elevated, fancy selection"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"of meats."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"We don't mean just Lunchable stuff."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"We're talking about prosciutto, mortadella, things of that nature."
01:04:37;01:04:41;"So even though you could technically grab a dictionary and be like, ""Oh, charcuterie"
01:04:41;01:04:48;"is just technically meat on a plate with some cheese,"" it would be such a gross misapplication"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"that I would say the answer is no."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"Lunchables are not charcuterie."
01:04:51;01:04:54;"I went to the Rose Garden at Coachella."
01:04:54;01:05:00;"We were in a rush, and there were long lines everywhere except for this one charcuterie stand."
01:05:00;01:05:07;"Me and a couple friends paid $18 a pop for these little trays of pretty--it's just like"
01:05:07;01:05:12;"a few slices of salami, some crackers, and some cheese."
01:05:12;01:05:17;"And one of them made the joke that we just paid $18 for these Lunchables."
01:05:17;01:05:22;"Okay, well, so there's something out there in the zeitgeist about the Lunchables/charcuterie"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"connection."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Alright, next question."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Lightning round."
01:05:25;01:05:29;"Alright, ""Are Bugles a chip, or are they in their own category?"""
01:05:29;01:05:32;"That's from Brandon @pepperjackflash."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Cool handle."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"That is a cool handle."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"Pepperjack Flash is a flavor of Bugles."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"Is it?"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"No, I'm just kidding."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Bugles are not a chip."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"I feel like the texture is almost more like a Cheeto or a--"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Wait, wait, wait, so a Cheeto is not a chip?"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"No, it's more like a rolled cracker."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"No, no, Cheetos are not chips."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"No, crisp."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"Alright, well, now we can get into that whole thing."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"Dev, I'm sorry, I know this must happen to you a lot in your life that you just become"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"the English--"
01:06:02;01:06:05;"It's okay, I keep asking you about Mike Myers movies."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"That's true."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Yeah, it's a two-way street."
01:06:08;01:06:12;"Dev, not only are Cheetos not chips, they're really not chips."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"What do you mean?"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"A chip has to be flat-ish."
01:06:16;01:06:21;"Like, somewhat making you think at least it was carved out of a potato?"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Yes, it has to be like in that shape family."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Are chips for dip?"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"Yeah, you have to be able to dip-- I guess you could dip a Cheeto and--"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"But wait, so are you trying to tell me that a Cheeto is not only the name of the brand,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"but the name of the object?"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"Well, it's--"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Like a cheese puff."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"That's a good question."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"Technically, it's a cheese puff."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Cheese puff."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"The umbrella category would be cheese puff."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Thank you, Ariel."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Nah, that's just a Cheeto."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"You just got to the crux of it."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"It's a puff."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"No, no, no, no, that's not true."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"That's not a puff."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"No."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"No, that's a cheese ball."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"Look, but you're wrong, because a crunchy Cheeto is not a puff."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"It's a puffed item."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"No, it's not."
01:06:55;01:06:56;"It's not puffed, it's crunchy."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Okay, tell me this."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"What do you think, Cheeto?"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Tell me this."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Okay, and also, we're going to--"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"The elephant in the room, everybody's listening."
01:07:03;01:07:06;"The elephant in the room is that in the UK, people call fries chips."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Yeah."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Correct."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"And they call chips crisps."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"Putting all that aside."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Okay, now we've got that out there."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Back to America."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Oh, this is just shit now."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"So let me tell you this."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"You're hosting a party."
01:07:17;01:07:23;"I kindly offer to go to the market to buy whatever you need."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Any products?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"I would say the store."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"You say to me--"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Okay, the store."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"The shop, I would say."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Okay."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"You say to me, ""Can you just buy a bunch of chips?"""
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Yeah."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Like, just different bags of chips."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Uh-huh."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"I do that."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Some of those bags are Cheetos."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"I come back."
01:07:39;01:07:46;"Will you then say, ""What the f*ck are these Cheetos doing with this group of bags of chips?"""
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Okay, interesting."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"Or would you just accept it as a bag--"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"I would accept it, but not because you're right."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"Just because I'm a laid-back, mellow guy."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"Everybody knows that."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"I don't kick up a fuss."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"I think at the shop--"
01:07:58;01:08:02;"And also, Spensy, if I'm throwing a party, the last thing I want to do is get knocked"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"out and drink out a fight with you when I need to be hosting."
01:08:06;01:08:11;"If I said, ""Go buy some chips,"" and you came back with just various types of Cheetos, I"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"would be like, ""Are you insane?"""
01:08:13;01:08:15;"That would be crazy."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"That would be--"
01:08:16;01:08:20;"But they're probably in an aisle in the chips section."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"What aisle would they be in if they're not chips?"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Snacks."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Yeah, they are snacks, but snacks is just a--"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Snacks is a bigger umbrella of chips."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"And you're talking about cookies."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Yes, they're all snacks."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"You know?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Exactly."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"Snacks is all types."
01:08:32;01:08:35;"Okay, well, Sanfo, did you get a number crunch for me?"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"Yeah, crunch those numbers."
01:08:36;01:08:42;"I'm on the Cheetos Wikipedia page, and two things have kind of come up, jumped out at"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"me."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"So you're right, are y'all."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"I'm sorry, the question wasn't in your--"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Cheetos."
01:08:50;01:08:54;"Cheetos are a brand of puffed cornmeal snacks."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"The other thing is on the sidebar--"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"What the question was?"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"What was the question?"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Puffs can be crunchy."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"It was Ruffles, no?"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"No, no, it was Bugles."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Bugles."
01:09:03;01:09:08;"Well, the sidebar is that product type under Wikipedia Cheetos is that they're classified"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"as a curl."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"They're cheese curls."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"A cheese curl."
01:09:11;01:09:12;"They're curls."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"Hold up."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"What?"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Well, what's a bugle then?"
01:09:15;01:09:16;"Now we're going to cheese curl."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Oh."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"So here, this is--"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"Wow."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"It's a puffed corn snack."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"We know what chips are."
01:09:21;01:09:27;"Cheese puffs, cheese curls, cheese balls, cheesy puffs, corn curls, or corn cheese are"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"a puffed corn snack."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Corn cheese?"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Coated-- I don't know what that is."
01:09:30;01:09:35;"Coated with a mixture of cheese or cheese flavored powders."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Here's what belongs in that family."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"Pirates--"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"I like that manufacturing technique."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Pirates booty."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Love that."
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Gluten free."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Cheetos."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"Oh, the year, too."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"From Frito-Lay."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Cheese doodles from Wise Foods."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"Some weird [bleep] from New Orleans called Cheeweez."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Cheeweez."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"That's a southern thing."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"You got Cheezies out of Canada."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Do you know Cheezies?"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Yeah, Cheezies."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"Oh, those are terrible."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Is that some UK [bleep] in there?"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"What's It's?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Oh, yeah."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"What's It's."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Exactly."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"What's It's made by Walkers is the only UK thing on the website."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"What's It's, you would say, is similar to Cheetos?"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"What about Monster Munch?"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Isn't that like a puffed snack?"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Yeah."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"What would you call Monster Munch?"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Crisps."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"Would you call What's It's crisps?"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"Yes."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"Okay, so that's just some UK [bleep]."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Well, okay, hold on."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"According to Wikipedia, Bugles are a corn chip."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"That makes sense."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"So the person who asked the question didn't look on Wikipedia?"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"I guess not, but they're a corn chip."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"But I said I don't think they're chips."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"So I don't know."
01:10:36;01:10:49;"I don't know."
01:10:49;01:11:10;"I don't know."
01:11:10;01:11:38;"I don't know."
01:11:38;01:11:50;"All right, guys, while we're on the subject, this is a time crisis classic."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"I just want to do a real quick roundtable."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"Are goldfish the snack cracker for kids or for adults?"
01:11:56;01:11:57;"Ariel?"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Kids."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"Despot?"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Everyone."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Oh, yeah, that's the third answer."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Dev?"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Everyone."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Dave?"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"Old people."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Everyone was not an option when it came to me, by the way."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"I'm following the rules."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Do you want to change your answer to everyone?"
01:12:12;01:12:13;"I think it's for kids."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"If you were sitting at the bus stop and you're by yourself and say you didn't take a shower"
01:12:18;01:12:23;"that day and you threw together a weird outfit and you had to pull out a snack to eat."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Just hypothetically."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Hypothetically, you pull out a snack to eat."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"Wait, he didn't take a shower?"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Yeah."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"It happens."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"I'm just saying."
01:12:30;01:12:35;"Can we tie this together and say it's the night after your party where I bought chips"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"and it's the night after my party, which was ruined."
01:12:38;01:12:42;"Everybody had to go home early because I got in a screaming match with Dev because I asked"
01:12:42;01:12:48;"him to buy chips and he came back with nothing but Cheetos, Whatsits, and Chewies."
01:12:48;01:12:53;"Ariel flew out to the party, which was in New Orleans, and then he has to take the Greyhound"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"back to LA."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"Why'd he fly out and then take the bus back?"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"I ran out of money."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"You bought all those chips."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"I used his money to buy the chips."
01:13:03;01:13:08;"Can you imagine yourself sitting there, crazy looking, all dirty and stuff, and you're going"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"to pull out goldfish."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"Is it really for everybody or are people going to look at you and be like, ""Who is this crazy"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"man at the bus stop eating children's snacks?"""
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Nah, because I'm with you."
01:13:18;01:13:22;"It feels like it's for teething kids."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"It's not a good look for a grown man to eat goldfish."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"They're Pepperidge Farm, right?"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Yes."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"So they come in a classy adult bag."
01:13:29;01:13:33;"Yeah, but Pepperidge Farm has other things for adults."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Yeah, I know."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"Pepperidge Farm is way more adult than Pirate Booty."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"It's a nice dignified bag."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Does Pepperidge Farms do-"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"It is a nice dignified bag."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Like meat?"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"What?"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"Does Pepperidge Farms do meat?"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"I don't think so."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"All of a sudden I pictured Pepperidge Farms charcuterie."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"Just in that white bag?"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"We're going to look that up for next time."
01:13:55;01:13:56;"Whether or not Pepperidge Farms is in the meat business."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Seinfeld, we got any more questions?"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"This one's specifically aimed at Jake."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"It's from Oliver M. Hondo."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"Who is Jake's favorite Frasier character?"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"Niles."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Oh."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Oh, you came through that quick."
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Yeah, why Niles?"
01:14:11;01:14:17;"I just like the quick, witty banter."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"Was he English?"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"Frasier."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Neither of them were English."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"They just kind of had, they were so educated."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"They had like an English affect."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"Got it."
01:14:25;01:14:27;"I think they were, what, they both went to Yale or something?"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"Yeah, that's what it was."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"Very confusing."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"They weren't English."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"I think part of the joke was that they were in Boston."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"Seattle."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"My bad."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"Although Frasier used to live in Boston when he drank at Cheers."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"That's what I was thinking of."
01:14:40;01:14:48;"Because that was his joke in Cheers was that he was Boston guy with this affected transatlantic"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"accent."
01:14:49;01:14:54;"And then also because they had these hoity-toity transatlantic accents, they really stood in"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"contrast to their working class cop father."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Rest in peace, John Mahoney."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Yeah."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Rest in peace."
01:15:00;01:15:05;"He was a young Kelsey Grammer in a supermarket in Margaretville, New York, where I guess"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"he lives over there."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"That's upstate?"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Yeah."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"And he was barefoot."
01:15:10;01:15:14;"He was in, he walked in supermarket barefoot and everyone knew him and he was chatting"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"up like the cashiers."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"He walked into the supermarket barefoot?"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Barefoot."
01:15:18;01:15:19;"And then he was walking around barefoot."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"And I took a picture of him."
01:15:20;01:15:21;"It's on my Instagram."
01:15:21;01:15:27;"Alex, how have we organically got to this story twice in two days?"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"That is so crazy."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Wow."
01:15:31;01:15:37;"Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"Quite stylish."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"And maybe I seem a bit confused."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"Yeah, maybe."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"But I got you pegs."
01:15:43;01:15:51;"But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
01:15:51;01:15:55;"We're going to take a quick break from this illustrious round table to talk to music journalist"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Stephen Hyden about his new book about classic rock."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"We got any classic rock fans in the building?"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Big fan."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Sure."
01:16:03;01:16:06;"I think Jake's the biggest fan."
01:16:06;01:16:07;"All right, let's get Stephen on the phone."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Hello, is that Stephen?"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Yes, it is."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Oh, hey, what's up?"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"You're on Time Crisis with Ezra and Jake."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Hey, how's it going?"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Hey, Stephen, it's Jake."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Hey, Jake."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"It's good to talk to you."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"Yeah."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"Thanks for calling in, man."
01:16:19;01:16:20;"So we know your book is just getting ready to be published."
01:16:20;01:16:21;"Yeah."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"It's just getting ready to be published."
01:16:22;01:16:23;"Yeah."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"So we're going to be talking about the book."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Yeah."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"So we're going to be talking about the book."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"Yeah."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"So we know that your book is dropping in a couple of days, so we want to talk about it."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"It's a very good topic for our show."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Yeah."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"Because we often also talk about classic rock."
01:16:35;01:16:40;"So your book is called Twilight of the Gods, A Journey to the End of Classic Rock."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Yes."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"So that implies that classic rock's over?"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"News to me."
01:16:44;01:16:48;"We're keeping the flame alive over here, man."
01:16:48;01:16:53;"Well, the book, it's talking about this moment that we're in right now where we're seeing"
01:16:53;01:16:59;"a lot of the big stars from 60s and 70s rock either starting to retire or even some of"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"them have passed away sadly."
01:17:02;01:17:08;"And a lot of these people, they've dominated the public's attention for 50 some years."
01:17:08;01:17:13;"And I think a lot of people are grappling with seeing these people start to leave the"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"stage."
01:17:14;01:17:19;"I never imagined that David Bowie could die or that Elton John would ever retire."
01:17:19;01:17:23;"And I mean, this is something that a lot of people say, is part of the reason that classic"
01:17:23;01:17:30;"rock feels particularly over is because nothing has entered the void left by those people."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"Right."
01:17:31;01:17:37;"I mean, well, like in my book, I make a distinction between classic rock and rock music now."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"I don't think rock music is dead."
01:17:39;01:17:45;"This is about a specific era that I think is like 20th century."
01:17:45;01:17:50;"And it's tied up with in classic rock radio, how that branded a certain generation of bands"
01:17:50;01:17:54;"as classic rock and kind of kept them on the radio forever."
01:17:54;01:17:59;"You know, like, you know, and that started in the early 80s with the Eagles, Led Zeppelin,"
01:17:59;01:18:03;"Pink Floyd, you know, that generation of bands, you know, it wasn't the thing like where you"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"were on the radio until you didn't have a hit anymore."
01:18:06;01:18:11;"You know, those bands were on the radio forever and they're still on the radio."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"And that created a certain perception of what those bands were."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"I think there's something specific about like the radio and like the narrative that that"
01:18:17;01:18:22;"created for people and how it imprinted a certain way of thinking about music in people's"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"minds that's kind of specific to that."
01:18:25;01:18:30;"I've been listening to the Eagles and 38 Special my entire life on the radio."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Right."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Which is incredible."
01:18:32;01:18:36;"Like if you walk into a Quiznos, good chance you're going to hear a track of Hotel California."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"And it's like, when is that going to end?"
01:18:39;01:18:43;"I feel like in 20 years, we still might be hearing New Kid in Town."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar."
01:18:48;01:18:57;"Great expectations, everybody's watching you."
01:18:57;01:19:06;"People you meet, they all seem to know you."
01:19:10;01:19:15;"Even your old friends treat you like you're something new."
01:19:15;01:19:26;"Johnny come lately, the new kid in town."
01:19:26;01:19:35;"Everybody loves you, so don't let them down."
01:19:35;01:19:39;"Jake was saying, will we be hearing 38 Special?"
01:19:39;01:19:44;"38 Special and the Eagles in 20 years on rock radio."
01:19:44;01:19:49;"So, is part of the end of classic rock also the end of the classic rock radio format?"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"I don't know."
01:19:50;01:19:53;"I mean, obviously, I can't predict the future."
01:19:53;01:19:57;"One of the things that the book explores or I'm kind of grappling with is like, what happens"
01:19:57;01:20:02;"to this music once you can't actually see them play live anymore, either because they're"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"retired or because they've passed away?"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Does the music continue?"
01:20:06;01:20:11;"Do we have a situation like where there's hologram tours that keep the Eagles on the"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"road?"
01:20:12;01:20:19;"Or are there like repertory bands that like play this music, like orchestras playing classical"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"composers?"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"These are uncharted waters."
01:20:22;01:20:27;"I've never thought of the live performance of classic rock bands as a particularly crucial"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"aspect of their longevity."
01:20:29;01:20:35;"I feel like it's much more just their general cultural ubiquity and their sort of like continuous"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"presence on the radio."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Right."
01:20:38;01:20:43;"And it's a situation where you can be a person who wasn't even alive, like when that music"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"was being made."
01:20:44;01:20:49;"You know, like I was born seven years after the Beatles broke up and I started listening"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"to them 20 years after they broke up."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"And I still feel like I grew up with the Beatles."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"Yeah."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"When I became sort of a conscious music fan and started buying records, I was buying Beatles"
01:21:00;01:21:05;"records along with like Nirvana records and Dr. Dre records and like all the sort of contemporary"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"stuff."
01:21:06;01:21:11;"Like classic rock felt very much current for me, although at the same time, like I felt"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"like it was eternal in some way."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"It seemed like it had always been there."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"A lot of that was because of my age."
01:21:17;01:21:22;"Like I didn't know that classic rock radio was a relatively new phenomenon."
01:21:22;01:21:28;"Like when I started listening to music, you know, like it started in the early 80s and"
01:21:28;01:21:32;"it became this entrenched format by the end of the decade."
01:21:32;01:21:37;"And like by the end of the 80s, that's where I kind of started first reading about music"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"and caring about it and buying tapes and stuff."
01:21:41;01:21:46;"But by then I just felt like, well, it's always been like this, you know, like these bands"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"have always been around."
01:21:47;01:21:52;"And it just felt like you were plugging into something mythic if you were listening to"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"Led Zeppelin."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Is it just about the years?"
01:21:54;01:21:59;"Classic rock basically start like '66, '67 and end at '80."
01:21:59;01:22:03;"What are the parameters of this mythical idea of classic rock?"
01:22:03;01:22:09;"I say that classic rock begins with Sgt. Pepper because the critics of that time drew a distinction"
01:22:09;01:22:16;"between rock and roll, which was, you know, the '50s original class of people and rock."
01:22:16;01:22:22;"And rock and roll being a music that is basically pop music, you know, for a young kid talking"
01:22:22;01:22:27;"about school, driving cars, you know, that kind of stuff."
01:22:27;01:22:34;"Whereas rock music being a more sort of self-conscious art form and dealing with adult themes."
01:22:34;01:22:39;"And Sgt. Pepper works as a dividing line there because it was this very sort of self-conscious"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"work of art and it was discussed in the media in those terms."
01:22:43;01:22:50;"Like if you read the reviews of Sgt. Pepper, it's like the most bombastic music writing ever."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"I mean, just talking about it being like a milestone in the history of human development."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"So you were digging into a lot of old reviews as you were writing the book?"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Oh yeah."
01:23:00;01:23:04;"Did you find anybody who was just like, ""Sgt. Pepper sucks."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"What is all this corny s***?"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"You're just a rock band."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Chill out."""
01:23:08;01:23:12;"Yeah, I mean, because these critics that wrote about that shift from rock and roll to rock,"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"like a lot of them didn't like that."
01:23:14;01:23:17;"Like Nick Cone or like Richard Meltzer."
01:23:17;01:23:22;"If you read people like that, they thought that that was a bad development."
01:23:22;01:23:27;"That it made rock pretentious and that it lost a lot of its original spirit."
01:23:27;01:23:33;"So like you already have people talking about the death of rock music in the late 60s."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"It's like the end of the innocent."
01:23:35;01:23:41;"And now instead of having these sexy, young, dangerous rock stars of the 50s,"
01:23:41;01:23:47;"you have these people with mustaches and Meru jackets and stroking their chins all the time"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"and making these sort of mock, profound statements."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Yeah, I took to classic rock."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"I feel like that is the beginning."
01:24:14;01:24:19;"And then in my book, you understand how you listen to classic rock radio now"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"when you hear bands from the 90s."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"I hate that."
01:24:22;01:24:27;"I feel like the end of classic rock is The Fragile by Nine Inch Nails."
01:24:27;01:24:30;"That's the benchmark I make, which is probably kind of a controversial opinion."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Very controversial."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"When's that? Like late 90s?"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"That's 99."
01:24:34;01:24:42;"Because to me, that was a record very much packaged together in the style of like a classic rock record."
01:24:42;01:24:46;"Like Trent Reznor worked with Bob Ezrin, who produced The Wall,"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"to help him sequence the record."
01:24:49;01:24:51;"It was a very expensive record to make."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"It took like five years to make."
01:24:53;01:24:58;"And it debuted at number one, and then it plummeted from number one."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"It went to number 16 in the second week."
01:25:01;01:25:09;"And that was the same year of Creed's Human Clay and Backstreet Boys' Millennium."
01:25:09;01:25:12;"And that was also the biggest year of the music industry, right?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"99."
01:25:13;01:25:18;"Yeah, the music industry, but it was also the year that Napster really took over college campuses."
01:25:18;01:25:25;"So you really have like, it's kind of the beginning of the end of that imperial age of the music industry."
01:25:25;01:25:29;"So like, I put that as the end point, because I feel like after that,"
01:25:29;01:25:34;"there's still like really popular rock bands into the 21st century."
01:25:34;01:25:40;"But like, they don't have the kind of ubiquity that bands had in the 20th century."
01:25:40;01:25:44;"I think it has a lot to do with how just the music business was set up."
01:25:44;01:25:50;"The music business was set up to put bands in people's living rooms every single day."
01:25:50;01:25:54;"And it made it easier for bands to have that kind of penetration."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"And I don't think that exists anymore."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"I mean, it clearly doesn't exist anymore."
01:25:58;01:26:02;"And it ends up just being kind of a self-fulfilling cycle, I think,"
01:26:02;01:26:06;"because bands don't get put in front of people."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"And then they don't have the same kind of meaning to people."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"They don't have the same kind of exposure, which makes them less popular,"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"which makes the industry less inclined to support bands like that,"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"which makes people less interested."
01:26:16;01:26:21;"You know, it's sort of a cycle that I think has continued since then."
01:26:21;01:26:25;"But yeah, going back to the '90s thing, I know that's a controversial thing,"
01:26:25;01:26:31;"that like, people don't like turning on Pots of Rock Radio and hearing ""Sticks"" and REO Speedwagon,"
01:26:31;01:26:36;"and then you hear like, ""Jeremy"" by Pearl Jam right after."
01:26:36;01:26:40;"It makes sense, because all those bands are kind of drawn from the same well, I think."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"I have a chapter in the book trying to define what classic rock is,"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"because it is such a sort of amorphous term."
01:26:46;01:26:50;"And some people look at it as a put-down."
01:26:50;01:26:53;"Like, if you call someone classic rock, they look at it as an insult."
01:26:53;01:26:58;"Like, I remember when David Bowie died, and there would be people who would call him classic rock,"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"and there would be like, blowback against that."
01:27:01;01:27:05;"Like, you were insulting David Bowie by calling him classic rock,"
01:27:05;01:27:10;"even though like, Rebel Rebel was probably playing on some classic rock station right now, as we speak."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"Yeah, it's not a cool term."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Yeah, it's not cool at all."
01:27:14;01:27:19;"I mean, I love classic rock, but if someone refers to something that I'm into as classic rock,"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"I'm just like, ""Oh, come on, man."""
01:28:13;01:28:17;"Well, I just want to ask you just one more question,"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"because it's been very interesting talking about like, the business and that side."
01:28:20;01:28:24;"But obviously, we haven't read it yet, but the way the title is phrased,"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"it seems like it's also a somewhat personal book."
01:28:26;01:28:31;"So, beyond being like, a music journalist, beyond like, wanting to get to the bottom of how this format was created,"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"and all the willings and dealings,"
01:28:33;01:28:38;"what does classic rock and the twilight of classic rock mean to you just as a person?"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Yeah, I mean, I was going to say, I mean, the book is really personal,"
01:28:40;01:28:46;"because, you know, this was, I say at the end that like, classic rock is my country, you know,"
01:28:46;01:28:49;"that I love it like I love America."
01:28:49;01:28:54;"You know, like, I feel like this was the music that kind of got me into music and got me caring about it, right?"
01:28:54;01:29:00;"Still love it so much, even though there's a lot about it that is problematic,"
01:29:00;01:29:05;"and that you can easily criticize, and I do criticize in the book."
01:29:05;01:29:10;"I mean, I call the book an affectionate critique of classic rock culture."
01:29:10;01:29:14;"You know, there's a lot of things that, you know, I talk about sort of the rise and fall of it,"
01:29:14;01:29:21;"and the things that have kind of gone bad, how it's been co-opted over the years, but I still love it, you know."
01:29:21;01:29:24;"And I didn't read comic books as a kid."
01:29:24;01:29:27;"You know, I liked sports, but I didn't, you know, athletes weren't my heroes."
01:29:27;01:29:33;"You know, like, my heroes were Bob Dylan, Pete Townsend, Keith Richards."
01:29:33;01:29:38;"You know, these were the larger-than-life people of my childhood, and still I looked up to them."
01:29:38;01:29:44;"So it's definitely a personal journey, but I think it's something that a lot of people can relate to,"
01:29:44;01:29:48;"because I don't think my experience listening to the radio and looking up to these people"
01:29:48;01:29:52;"and buying the records and all that, reading the liner notes and watching rock documentaries"
01:29:52;01:29:55;"and reading rock books and all that stuff, I don't think that's unique."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"I think a lot of people have gone through that, so."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Definitely."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"But I think a lot of people will relate to what I'm writing about."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"Rad. Well, cool, man. Thanks for calling in. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the book."
01:30:04;01:30:08;"Thanks for having me. I love the show, and thanks again."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Awesome. Thanks, man. Of course, dude. Have a good one."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Okay, take care."
01:30:24;01:30:29;"It's one. Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
01:30:29;01:30:46;"Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals. I get my back into my living."
01:30:46;01:31:02;"I don't need to fight to prove I'm right. I don't need to be forgiven."
01:31:30;01:31:47;"Don't cry. Don't brace your eye. It's only teenage wasteland."
01:31:47;01:32:03;"Silent take my hand. Travel soft lost land. Pull out the fire. Don't look past my shoulder."
01:32:03;01:32:26;"The exodus is here. The happy ones are here. Let's get together and forget the folder."
01:32:26;01:32:45;"Teenage wasteland. Teenage wasteland. Teenage wasteland. Teenage wasteland. They're all wasted."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"All right, thank you to Steven."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Book comes out May 8th."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"And check out his book about to drop."
01:32:50;01:32:59;"All right, so because we have this illustrious round table, this royal rumble of musical intellect,"
01:32:59;01:33:02;"we don't want to do just a boring old top five."
01:33:02;01:33:08;"We want to really go deep on a year that we don't talk about that much on this show, at least in the top five."
01:33:08;01:33:11;"A lot of times on this show, we talk about the current songs on the charts."
01:33:11;01:33:15;"And honestly, it's been getting a little stale lately because over and over again, we just get,"
01:33:15;01:33:20;"if it's meant to be, it'll be. Hold up, girl."
01:33:20;01:33:25;"So anyway, we're just going to do an old year and it's not going to be the 70s or the 80s, which we hit a lot."
01:33:25;01:33:29;"I think because we've been talking about Alanis Morissette, we're going to do 1996."
01:33:29;01:33:33;"This week in 1996, the top five Billboard singles."
01:33:33;01:33:40;"And just picture back then in 96, Jagged Little Pill is this huge album. Radiohead's touring with Alanis."
01:33:40;01:33:45;"In fact, before we get into it, anybody remember what they were doing in 96?"
01:33:45;01:33:48;"College. You were in college? Yeah, dude. April 96."
01:33:48;01:33:53;"So I would have been, I guess, yeah, freshman year. Skateboarding."
01:33:53;01:33:59;"You were skateboarding? Could you ollie? Barely. OK. But I could. Dave, what were you doing in 96?"
01:33:59;01:34:03;"I was trying to think. I think I was in sixth grade or seventh grade."
01:34:03;01:34:08;"I had a phase in middle school where I was super into lemurs."
01:34:08;01:34:16;"The primate of Madagascar. Oh man, I was hoping you were going to say that was like a cool skateboarding brand, but nope."
01:34:16;01:34:21;"I remember I did like an independent study in my school about lemurs."
01:34:21;01:34:25;"And you were like into it enough that even outside of school you were thinking about lemurs?"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"I think so, yeah. I was like reading whatever I could about them."
01:34:28;01:34:33;"They're also, I mean, they're super cute. Their eyes are, they're like our eyes."
01:34:33;01:34:37;"You know what, man, for your next birthday, I'm going to get you a lemur."
01:34:37;01:34:43;"I'm sure it's not legal. Really? I doubt it. To have a pet lemur?"
01:34:43;01:34:47;"Oh, because there's... Well, like when MJ had bubbles, was that legal?"
01:34:47;01:34:56;"I assume so. Can you have like a... I think that wasn't the legal issue he was most worried about at the time."
01:34:56;01:35:01;"You know what's funny is he was doing international travel with bubbles too, because wasn't he like taking bubbles to Japan and s***?"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Yeah, totally. Probably had a passport."
01:35:03;01:35:08;"It only cost $1500 to $2500. To buy a lemur? Yeah."
01:35:08;01:35:13;"You can do it? I guess, but macaques and baboons are $3500."
01:35:13;01:35:20;"Nick just found a website that looks so shady called exoticanimalsforsale.net. Oh God."
01:35:20;01:35:26;"And there's this thing, lemurs for sale. Yeah. You got to apply for approval, so it's legit."
01:35:26;01:35:31;"Wait, in the location, there's a lemur for sale in Charlotte, North Carolina."
01:35:31;01:35:37;"It's a male ring-tailed lemur, born March 3rd. Put your money where your mouth is. $2000."
01:35:37;01:35:41;"Get him a lemur. Let's go. When's your birthday? I'll make the call. Don't get me a lemur."
01:35:41;01:35:47;"Wait, look. This is the lemur hanging out with this dude in North Carolina. That's pretty cute."
01:35:47;01:35:52;"Wow. Okay, well, Dave. I don't like the quality of that photo. You don't like the quality?"
01:35:52;01:35:59;"Kind of desaturated. Yeah. Maybe it's not real, but look, I'm down to buy it for you, but the one thing is like that's a big responsibility."
01:35:59;01:36:04;"So as long as you or someone in your household is going to take care of it and stuff."
01:36:04;01:36:10;"Could he be the tour lemur? Well, yeah, because so by the way, Dave, there's ring-tailed lemur financing available too."
01:36:10;01:36:17;"Really? Yeah. Wow. I would love to get this for you because I know that you've been passionate about lemurs since a young age,"
01:36:17;01:36:23;"and I know you've never even held one, and that's just, let alone owned one."
01:36:23;01:36:29;"I held one last year. You did? What? Elephant in the room. I kept that quiet."
01:36:29;01:36:35;"You held a lemur? Yeah. I went to a monkey sanctuary. Where was I? Mexico. Went to a monkey sanctuary in Mexico."
01:36:35;01:36:38;"And they had a lemur? They had lemurs. There was a whole room full of lemurs."
01:36:38;01:36:44;"What kind of lemur was it? Are they just ridiculously cute? Yeah. You need a class three pet license."
01:36:44;01:36:51;"Okay. We'll get one of those. Wait, so Dave, in terms of taking care of the lemur and stuff, I know you're passionate about lemurs."
01:36:51;01:36:57;"I know that you are educated on them. I know you've done original research regarding them."
01:36:57;01:37:03;"So I don't think there's any lack of fire there, but I also know Dirty Projectors is getting back on the road."
01:37:03;01:37:07;"Yeah. There'd be friction there. I think it could be kind of the band mascot,"
01:37:07;01:37:14;"the longer you feed it good food and vitamins, and make sure you keep that class three animal license on you."
01:37:14;01:37:18;"In good order. At all times. Where are you guys playing? This is a U.S. tour?"
01:37:18;01:37:24;"Yeah. U.S. starting around here. Breaking it into two layers. You know, you know how it goes."
01:37:24;01:37:30;"So that means we're going to get an album pretty soon? I'm working on it. All right. Working on it."
01:37:30;01:37:36;"But in the meantime, people can come check out the tour. Because actually, I've been in the studio like so much."
01:37:36;01:37:44;"I feel like I haven't seen anybody in this room in like so long because I've just been in this recording."
01:37:44;01:37:49;"Honestly, I feel like we only see you at Alanis Morissette roundtables. That's true. That's true. That's kind of how it is."
01:37:49;01:37:53;"Well, everybody got to go check out the tour. We're excited for the album whenever it comes."
01:37:53;01:38:00;"And no promises, but you might just see a lemur on Dirty Projectors tour. Wow."
01:38:00;01:38:05;"Maybe. At the very least, you'll see Dirty Projectors and the lemur would be a bonus."
01:38:15;01:38:23;"Unimpressed, Archimedes, palimpsest, just hanging out, or Julian Casablancas."
01:38:23;01:38:32;"She is an epiphany of electricity, opens my days like she always knew."
01:38:32;01:38:42;"I feel an affinity, immediately, in all the ways she's a ray through."
01:38:42;01:38:52;"Under the sun, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:38:52;01:39:00;"It's cold out there, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:39:00;01:39:09;"She is so wild, middle of high brow, her line is Pablo, but her color's fauve, so what about it?"
01:39:09;01:39:18;"Just to review, she will a breakthrough, nobody stops her, no one can lock her down."
01:39:18;01:39:27;"She is an epiphany of electricity, opens my days like she always knew."
01:39:27;01:39:37;"I feel an affinity, immediately, in all the ways she's a ray through."
01:39:37;01:39:47;"Under the sun, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:39:47;01:40:03;"It's cold out there, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:40:03;01:40:12;"She's a breakthrough."
01:40:12;01:40:19;"She is a breakthrough."
01:40:19;01:40:29;"She's a breakthrough."
01:40:29;01:40:33;"She's a breakthrough."
01:40:33;01:40:42;"Under the sun, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:40:42;01:40:52;"It's cold out there, there's nothing new, but she keeps it warm, on, straight into shade, she's a breakthrough."
01:40:52;01:41:02;"She's a breakthrough."
01:41:02;01:41:12;"She is a breakthrough."
01:41:12;01:41:22;"She's a breakthrough."
01:41:22;01:41:38;"She is a breakthrough."
01:41:38;01:41:42;"Okay, so let's do the very special top five."
01:41:42;01:41:48;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:41:48;01:42:06;"So, I swear I didn't do this on purpose, but the number five song in 1996 on the Billboard Hot 100 was this."
01:42:06;01:42:15;"Do you remember that intro?"
01:42:15;01:42:34;"And Dad, the next day."
01:42:34;01:42:42;"That's crazy."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"Yeah."
01:42:44;01:42:48;"Sounds like there's no clip track, because the chorus came in faster than the verse."
01:42:48;01:42:50;"Also, no snare."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Yeah."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Yeah, there is no snare."
01:42:53;01:42:57;"It's interesting."
01:42:57;01:43:07;"Great singer."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Wait, so how old was she?"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Okay, let's get to the bottom of this."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"In 1996."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"Number crunch?"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Simon, let me get a number crunch."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"21?"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"That's really crazy."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"So when she made the record, she was like 19, 20."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"That's crazy."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"That's how they used to do it."
01:43:24;01:43:27;"She's amazing, but she did have Glenn Ballard."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"She's a young performer."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"She's been on TV."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"She's a good performer."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"She had Dave Coulier also."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Yeah, how old was Dave Coulier?"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"I don't know."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"A lot older."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Yeah."
01:43:39;01:43:44;"Because if the album was out when she was 21, she probably recorded it when she was 20."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Maybe she wrote it when she was 19."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Oh, hold on."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"I thought you just said she was 19 in '96."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"No, she's 21 when this was number five."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"Oh."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"The number four song."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"This is a very interesting top five."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"Number four song is Tony Rich Project, ""Nobody Knows."""
01:43:59;01:44:06;"Wow, that's like a real '80s palette."
01:44:06;01:44:09;"A lot of '80s left over in the '90s."
01:44:09;01:44:17;"Jake knows it."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"But instead"
01:44:19;01:44:26;"I pretended I'm glad you went away"
01:44:26;01:44:29;"These four walls close and cover everything"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"Bass in the '90s is crazy."
01:44:31;01:44:34;"And I'm down and sad"
01:44:34;01:44:38;"And nobody knows it but me"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"I don't think I've ever heard this song in my life."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"Really?"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"Wait, what?"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Yeah, I don't know this stuff."
01:44:43;01:44:44;"It was number four in 1996."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"I think."
01:44:45;01:44:46;"I don't know."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"This song's huge."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Maybe it was bigger in England, actually."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"This is also like--"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"That was huge here."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"Yeah."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"I guess it was."
01:44:54;01:44:55;"Jake knows it."
01:44:55;01:44:56;"I know it was huge."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"I know it really well, too."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"I was more chapped into the radio then, though."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Oh, right."
01:45:01;01:45:02;"Young man."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"That's true."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"I was also very radio at that age."
01:45:05;01:45:10;"This is also that mid to late '90s wave, like baby face,"
01:45:10;01:45:14;"like Eric Clapton, ""Tears in Heaven,"" NPV and ""Plugged."""
01:45:14;01:45:15;"That's 1996."
01:45:15;01:45:18;"No, I'm saying this is that same wave of like acoustic-y--"
01:45:18;01:45:21;"Sonically, I get it."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"Yeah."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Number three, another '90s icon."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Also, I'm sure we've talked about this before,"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"but three of the biggest selling artists of the '90s"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"were Canadian women."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"And the big three are Alanis with the Giant album."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"Celine."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"Celine Dion and Shania Twain."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"And Canada's a small country."

01:45:42;01:45:45;"Seinfeld just chimed in, ""Not geographically."""

01:45:51;01:45:52;"No, you're right."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"Canada's a big country geographically,"

01:45:57;01:45:59;"You're saying it's quaint."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"Yeah, compared to America, it's not a lot of people."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"So the number three song was--"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"So look at that, we got two Canadian women"

01:50:55;01:50:57;"No."
01:50:57;01:51:01;"So I had some friends that toured with Eazy-E randomly."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Damn."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"Yeah, it's late era."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"They said everywhere the bus would stop, go to a Waffle House,"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"everywhere they went with Eazy-E, people would be like,"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"""Holy sh*t, it's Eazy-E."""
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Like, in the South somewhere."

01:51:18;01:51:21;"Like, ""Please, get me out of here. Sign me."""
01:51:21;01:51:24;"And he was always really nice, apparently."
01:51:24;01:51:29;"And he'd say similar things like, ""Good luck. You guys are talented."
01:51:29;01:51:32;"If you ever make it out to L.A., look me up."""
01:51:32;01:51:35;"And Bone Thugs were one of those occasions."

01:51:37;01:51:38;"Yeah, they're from Ohio."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Okay, so yeah."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"So Ohio."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"They got in a car on a bus."
01:51:42;01:51:43;"I don't know how they got there."
01:51:43;01:51:48;"They went to Calabasas to the offices of--"

01:51:51;01:51:52;"Ruthless Records, exactly."
01:51:52;01:51:57;"And they just showed up, and they're just like, ""Eric told us to come see him."""
01:51:57;01:52:00;"And the woman at the front was like, ""Uh, who are you?"""
01:52:00;01:52:02;"Bone Thugs and Harmony."
01:52:02;01:52:05;"It was awkward, and eventually she got him."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Like, seven hours later?"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"Yeah, whatever. She got him, and then he was like, ""All right."""
01:52:09;01:52:12;"And he put them in the studio, and they just started doing their thing."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"And then, yeah."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"It was just so wild."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Wow."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"I love it."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"That's what happened."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Never give up on your dreams."
01:52:19;01:52:22;"And then they were on like Sally, Jessie, Raphael, and [bleep]"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Right."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"Going crazy."
01:52:24;01:52:29;"I mean, Bone Thugs, so just like kind of out of nowhere."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"Also never really imitated."
01:52:31;01:52:38;"They were imitators, but people just didn't really buy it as much."
01:52:38;01:52:42;"But there was an era like eight years ago where mad people were imitating them."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"Is that right, Despot?"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"Yeah, I would agree."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"I would also say that-"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"I just mean like in the time, they were number two on the top five."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"Yeah."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"And I don't remember like a lot of-"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Yeah, I think it was too weird."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"They weren't part of a wave."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"Yeah, they were like-"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"No, but you know how Nirvana had a big record, and all of a sudden there's like-"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"There was like-"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"You mean after work?"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"A whole spin off of like the same kind of time."
01:53:02;01:53:05;"I'm sure it existed, but we just never got to hear it."
01:53:05;01:53:11;"I think there's a lot of new current like singy rap that is borrowing from Bone Thugs."
01:53:11;01:53:15;"Yeah, I could see like at the time, Bone Thugs was just so crazy and so different"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"that people didn't even know where to start with it."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Is it R&B? Is it rap?"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Yeah."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"It was almost too original to like easily rip off."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"And then the trip-"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"Yeah, and then they're doing songs with Phil Collins later."
01:53:27;01:53:31;"That's why I didn't like them, because I was like, ""These guys are singing. I hate this."""
01:53:31;01:53:34;"And then they did a song with Biggie, and I was like, ""I like it."""
01:53:34;01:53:35;"I like Biggie."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"So just to recap, guys."
01:53:38;01:53:41;"We got number five, Ironic Alanis Morissette."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"Number four, Nobody Knows."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Tony Rich Project."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Number three, Because You Love Me, Celine Dion."
01:53:45;01:53:48;"Number two, The Crossroads, Bone Thugs, and Harmony."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"Are you ready for the number one song this week in '96?"
01:53:50;01:53:51;"Can't imagine."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"I cannot imagine."
01:53:53;01:53:56;"Wow, okay."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"I don't have it yet."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"I don't either."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"Yeah, I ain't got it."
01:54:00;01:54:01;"Wait till you hear that."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"Oh my God, Mariah."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"Mariah, of course."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Of course."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"Ah, I love this song."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Yeah."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"This is probably another Walter, Walter Afonosia."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"This song is sick."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Production."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Yeah."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"Shout out MC."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"The importance of a bass drum."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Is that really true?"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"He took away the bass drum."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"This song feels so different."
01:54:16;01:54:22;"Man, virginity getting lost."
01:54:22;01:54:26;"Mine."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"To this song?"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Nah."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Nah, it was gone already."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Dang it."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"Yeah, right."
01:54:33;01:54:36;"I was f***ing in third grade."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Uh-huh."
01:54:37;01:54:41;"Pretty long intro."
01:54:41;01:54:46;"Yeah, 49 second intro."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"They had that kind of time in the 90s."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"How long is the whole song?"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"418."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Mine."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Now you wanna be free."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"So I let you fly."
01:54:58;01:55:01;"Cause I know in my heart, babe."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"Our love will never die."
01:55:04;01:55:07;"How come songs don't fade out anymore?"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Ariel."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"When did that stop happening?"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"Almost every song that I work on fades out."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Really?"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"I feel like pop songs, they just cut off at the end."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"Pop songs cut off."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Yeah."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"I just read a thing, it was on like the hood report or something today."
01:55:23;01:55:32;"That Mariah Carey went to the hospital cause she thought like Biggie and Tupac were coming over for dinner or something."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"They're trying to play her."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Yeah."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"They're trying to play her."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Oh, she never said that."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"I mean, I don't know."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"But it's just something I read today."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"I think on the hood report."
01:55:40;01:55:44;"Passing it on."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Yeah, I'm not saying she said that."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"I'm not the hood report."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"It's funny, Despy, you said this is like a lose your virginity song."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Yeah."
01:55:50;01:55:53;"Cause I don't know if, I do associate the song so much with young love."
01:55:53;01:56:00;"I think also part of it's cause this had the beautiful black and white video of the kids at like summer camp, like by the lake."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"I don't remember that, but yeah, probably."
01:56:02;01:56:06;"How deep are we into Mariah's career at this point?"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"Like five, six years?"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"Yeah, I think we're on album three."
01:56:11;01:56:14;"I guess her earlier stuff was late 80s, no?"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"No."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"I thought maybe she came out like 80, it was like 80, 89."
01:56:18;01:56:19;"Yeah, 89, 90."
01:56:19;01:56:20;"Yeah."
01:56:20;01:56:22;"This is like, oh yeah, so like seven years."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"This might be third or fourth album."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"Huh."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"I think it's third."
01:56:25;01:56:26;"That sounds right to me."
01:56:26;01:56:30;"But third from 88 would be like kind of a long time."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Well, these records were massive."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"But those albums are so big."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"She's probably not in a hurry."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Yeah."
01:56:37;01:56:41;"When your days and your nights get a little bit colder."
01:56:41;01:56:46;"I know that."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"You'll be right back baby."
01:56:49;01:56:53;"Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time."
01:56:53;01:57:01;"I gotta say, I always, I love the lyrics to the song, but I've always like found myself thinking about, you'll always be a part of me."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"And I'm part of you indefinitely."
01:57:03;01:57:06;"She also says you can't escape, right?"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"It's kind of like chill out."
01:57:08;01:57:12;"It's just like indefinitely is such a unromantic word."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Yeah, it's like a contract."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Yeah."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"It's such a sweet young love song."
01:57:17;01:57:19;"Generous sentiment."
01:57:19;01:57:24;"So this is her fourth album, if you don't count the Christmas album."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"Whoa, big album."
01:57:25;01:57:27;"So it's her fifth album."
01:57:27;01:57:29;"Whoa, so she was like work busy."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"Prolific."
01:57:30;01:57:31;"Yeah."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"Wow."
01:57:32;01:57:37;"Yeah, the last like two minutes of the song or just freestyles over the chorus and still only for 18."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"It's crazy."
01:57:38;01:57:39;"Right."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Said a lot very quickly."
01:57:41;01:57:44;"Yeah, that is a beautiful song."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"It's a good week."
01:57:45;01:57:46;"That's a history."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"Top five."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"Good week in history."
01:57:48;01:57:52;"You guys ever go through the top five and you're like, God, all of those were."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"Mm."
01:57:54;01:57:59;"In the late 70s, you get a few to kind of like maybe three out of five or kind of like just like schlock."
01:57:59;01:58:03;"What's crazy is like next week might have been like Limp Bizkit."
01:58:03;01:58:07;"No, this is still 96."
01:58:07;01:58:12;"Was there more like chart like turnover from week to week then than there is now?"
01:58:12;01:58:13;"Yes."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Now songs hang out forever."
01:58:15;01:58:20;"Because when I was on before, you guys were comparing whatever year it was to 81."
01:58:20;01:58:23;"Do you still do that where you're cutting back and forth?"
01:58:23;01:58:27;"Yeah, sometimes we just felt with this many people this week, we couldn't get into it."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"Oh, just so you guys know, by the way."
01:58:29;01:58:30;"That's cool."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"Because a week to week is probably the same five songs you're dealing with."
01:58:32;01:58:34;"So that was the week."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"That was the week of May 11th, 1996."
01:58:36;01:58:42;"And just so everybody knows, the next week, May 18th, 96, the Crossroads made it to number one."
01:58:42;01:58:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"Always be my baby went to number two."
01:58:45;01:58:48;"It was actually the exact same top five except that swapped."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"Reshuffled."
01:58:49;01:58:54;"And also, if we go a little bit deeper into the top 10, you get some fun songs like,"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Give me one reason to stay here."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:58:57;01:58:58;"And I'm going to run back around."
01:58:58;01:58:59;"Oh, man."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"That's her debut."
01:59:01;01:59:02;"I think so."
01:59:02;01:59:03;"Tracy Chapman?"
01:59:03;01:59:04;"No, no, no, no."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Also, that's right."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"Fast cars."
01:59:08;01:59:09;"No, fast cars in the 80s."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"Right."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"It's all the same."
01:59:11;01:59:12;"Oh, yeah."
01:59:12;01:59:15;"Give me one reason to stay here was like a significantly later."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"It's the follow up."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"I think it's the next record."
01:59:18;01:59:19;"I think so."
01:59:19;01:59:22;"Anyway, so that was our top five."
01:59:22;01:59:24;"A hell of a week in 1996."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"And that's our show."
01:59:26;01:59:29;"Thank you to Jimothee Lacoste and Stephen Hine for calling in."
01:59:29;01:59:32;"And thank you to this incredible group of people."
01:59:32;01:59:38;"Dave Longstreth, Dev Hines, Deathspot, R.L. Rechshied, and as always, Jake and Seinfeld."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:59:40;01:59:43;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Beats."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"One."
