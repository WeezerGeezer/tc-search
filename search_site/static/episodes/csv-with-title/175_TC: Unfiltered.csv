00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:11;"So much to talk about in this funny old world of ours, and yet there's only three topics that really matter"
00:11;00:14;"this weekend."
00:14;00:17;"And that's pizza,"
00:17;00:20;"water,"
00:20;00:21;"and Kate Bush."
00:21;00:26;"This is a very special Holy Trinity episode of"
00:26;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:33;"Let's begin."
00:41;01:08;"chances. You were a friend, warming me, on my ride through chances. My picture clear. Everything seems so easy. And so I delved to the floor. One of us had to go. Now it's
different. I want you to know."
01:08;01:19;"One of us is crying. One of us is lying. We've been only there."
01:19;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. What's up? Another typical low energy start. We always get there."
01:25;01:30;"We don't come out the gate with a lot of heat. But that's how you know we're real. Yep. Cold"
01:30;01:38;"engine. You're along for the ride with us. Yeah, you can go ahead. Skip 45 minutes in."
01:38;01:47;"Probably a good idea. This is how Time Crisis starts. It's a little bit of housekeeping."
01:47;01:52;"I was talking with a friend who had listened to our fully loaded baked potato episode."
01:52;01:59;"And I guess we didn't talk about on the show that Wendy's used to have baked potatoes."
01:59;02:04;"That was like a go to thing at Wendy's. True. Do they still have it on the menu? I don't"
02:04;02:10;"know. I haven't been to Wendy's in like 10 years. It seems so funny and old fashioned."
02:10;02:14;"Like a Wendy's baked potato that almost, you know, it's like when you hear stories about"
02:14;02:19;"Dunkin Donuts being like a sit down restaurant or like McDonald's having like steak and mashed"
02:19;02:26;"potatoes and like 1955. Do you guys remember this Seinfeld and Nick that Wendy's had fully"
02:26;02:33;"loaded baked potatoes? I've had it like so that was like a classic thing. Yeah, but I"
02:33;02:40;"had it like three years ago. I feel like for a certain. Yeah, I feel for a certain Wendy's"
02:40;02:46;"customer. The baked potato has been sort of a mainstay. It'll be kind of sad if they ever"
02:46;02:51;"get rid of it and then they're just the same as McDonald's and Burger King. Just slightly"
02:51;02:56;"different burgers. I think the chili and the baked potato are two things that distinguish"
02:56;03:02;"Wendy's from the rest. Is Gen Z eating baked potatoes? Look, I didn't even bring this up"
03:02;03:08;"last time, but we eat baked potatoes fairly regularly in our house. Really? Yeah. Are"
03:08;03:15;"they fully loaded? No, I think that there's like semi loaded. I think that we'll do maybe"
03:15;03:22;"a little bit of never. I think we'll do some sour cream, butter, maybe chives. But I think"
03:22;03:27;"you go bacon and you're taking this sort of hearty, healthy dish and you're sort of tipping"
03:27;03:34;"it into. Yeah. So but that being said is, you know, I got a question. I did bite my"
03:34;03:38;"tongue and when when everyone said, oh, who does this anymore? We do it. You're living"
03:38;03:45;"a very traditional lifestyle with your family. You're off the grid. No electricity. Your"
03:45;03:53;"son has zero screen time and you're regularly eating baked potatoes. He's going to go out"
03:53;04:02;"into a cruel into a cruel world. Everyone making fun of his baked potato. I got a question."
04:02;04:08;"Is a baked potato a side dish or is it? I guess I can kind of remember back in the day"
04:08;04:12;"it would be an option as a side, but a fully loaded baked potato. Is that kind of like"
04:12;04:17;"an entree? Is that a main course? How are you doing it at your house, Nick? We're doing"
04:17;04:20;"in our house. It will be we're having a baked potato for dinner. I mean, that would be the"
04:20;04:26;"dinner maybe with some veggies on the side. So it's your main course. Yeah. I mean, certainly"
04:26;04:31;"there's there's an option that, you know, when you go to a restaurant, you'd get a baked"
04:31;04:36;"potato, I think, as a side. But that seems crazy. I mean, it's so hearty, especially"
04:36;04:40;"if you're going to get it fully loaded. But you're still talking about a giant potato."
04:40;04:44;"Well, I guess that's also a question when you know it's baked potato night. It's Monday,"
04:44;04:50;"Wednesday or Friday at your house and you're going potato shopping that day. You have to"
04:50;04:57;"go for like a pretty big one like a two hander. Yeah, it's a big potato and it is delicious."
04:57;05:03;"You know, it's salt. You honestly it would be kind of in our house again, semi loaded."
05:03;05:09;"But I think traditionally you'd get you'd bake the potato, ghee butter and some sea"
05:09;05:16;"salt. And I think that that with some veggies is a is a great meal. Is that a rare example"
05:16;05:22;"of baked potato as a main? Because I can't think of any other potato entrees. I feel"
05:22;05:26;"like it's always that's the exception. It's otherwise. I think if you add mashed potatoes"
05:26;05:32;"as your main, that seems psycho. French fries as your main. That's a fully loaded mashed"
05:32;05:36;"potatoes. What have you got? Some kind of fully loaded fries like well, well, Seinfeld"
05:36;05:41;"the Canadian could poutine be a main? Oh God. Yeah. If it's fully loaded with meat and all"
05:41;05:45;"that stuff. That's like your whole day. Like you eat that for lunch and it's just I think"
05:45;05:50;"you're good for until the next morning. So yeah, I'm going to introduce baked potato"
05:50;05:53;"night in my household. We're bringing back baked potato night."
05:53;06:05;"My baby woke me up this morning. She said get down that labour exchange. And if you don't"
06:05;06:17;"come home with a job, sir, you'll get no dinner today. You gotta secure me a weekly worthy"
06:17;06:30;"wage. You'll get no more empty cooking. You'll get no more apple pie. You just get those"
06:30;06:38;"plain hot potatoes to satisfy your appetite."
06:38;07:01;"Jake, when I say that we do this, you don't like this at all. Like you wouldn't want a"
07:01;07:05;"baked potato with a little bit of butter and salt. You don't think that that would be tasty?"
07:05;07:09;"No, I think it'd be. I think it could be good. I think I would need to do like put some hot"
07:09;07:13;"sauce on there or something. I don't think it would really. Yeah. I know what you're"
07:13;07:17;"saying. I don't want to load it up. So it's too caloric. I wouldn't want to dump a bunch"
07:17;07:21;"of like cheddar cheese and bacon on it. I mean, I would, I would want to do that, but"
07:21;07:26;"I wouldn't do it. So I think I would do like hit it with some hot sauce with some butter"
07:26;07:30;"and salt. Sounds good. If you have like a nice salad or like a, I don't know, like a"
07:30;07:35;"Russell sprout or something with like a roasted Brussels sprout with it. Roast those while"
07:35;07:40;"you're doing the potato. I mean, I'm on board, dude. I'm into this TC baked potato night."
07:40;07:46;"Plus an ice cold beer. Oh yeah. Dude. Glass of red wine. Maybe. I don't know. We're just,"
07:46;07:52;"this is getting classy. My next birthday, I'm going to do a baked potato party. I'm"
07:52;07:59;"going to hire a baked potato truck. Everybody comes to truck. I'll find the best baked potato"
07:59;08:06;"truck here, dude. Of like the, maybe we started this book artisanal, uh, food truck scene."
08:06;08:12;"Am I correct? That in, in a late season, eastbound and down the Danny McBride show, there was"
08:12;08:16;"a joke on that show about fixings. Did they open it? Was it baked potatoes? They opened"
08:16;08:22;"a baked potato kiosk in the mall. Damn dude. I do not remember. Yeah. Kenny and Steve,"
08:22;08:28;"I think have a heart to heart where they get into the fee. If the Xans, uh, right. There's"
08:28;08:34;"a Mac and cheese truck that parks near my house. Sort of. I'm all, I've never hit it."
08:34;08:39;"I'm just sort of like Mac and cheese truck. What? Honestly, if I saw a baked potato truck,"
08:39;08:44;"I'd be like much more interested. Just a real simple baked potato. We can also have some"
08:44;08:49;"fun with it. I like Nick's vibe of like the minimalist baked potato. You know, like there's,"
08:49;08:54;"there's famously a sign at some kind of slightly more traditional uptight sushi restaurants"
08:54;09:01;"in LA famously at sushi park. There's a sign outside that says before you even walk in"
09:01;09:07;"no California rolls, which I think kind of signals a type of traditionalism, a type of"
09:07;09:12;"seriousness. And I think our baked potato truck could have a very minimalist design"
09:12;09:17;"and could have a sign that says do not ask for fully loaded. And basically you have like"
09:17;09:25;"two options. Number one is the ghee and sea salt baked potato. And number two is like,"
09:25;09:32;"I don't know. You can add chives. Yeah. One or two chives, the minimalist baked potato"
09:32;09:38;"truck. So in eastbounded down Kenny powers, uh, he has a restaurant idea called TNT and"
09:38;09:42;"he's explained it's like a Hooters style restaurant, but with potatoes and he's explaining it to"
09:42;09:47;"Steve and then it gets into the fix. And so they have this sort of back and forth. There"
09:47;09:55;"is a baked potato truck in New York, like a food truck called the potato house. And"
09:55;10:02;"uh, yeah, I think I mean it mainly is sold on, on how fully loaded you can get it. So"
10:02;10:05;"I think we're in new territory. I think there's a whole, there's definitely still a hole in"
10:05;10:12;"the market for just a straight up, very clean, classic, minimalist baked potato. I can't"
10:12;10:18;"wait for that New York times profile. Just a kind of elegant photograph of us standing"
10:18;10:27;"together. It says, meet the man who brought, who brought the baked potato to Gen Z. Is"
10:27;10:34;"this like, um, great internet radio pivot into food trucks with their minimalist baked"
10:34;10:43;"potato? I mean, that's it. Definitely. That sounds real. Yeah. In an era of keto diets"
10:43;10:50;"and you know, general abstention from carbs, these boys have turned it around. So you know"
10:50;10:55;"how there's like a savory crepe and then there's sweet crepes like are sweet baked potatoes,"
10:55;11:01;"something we could maybe, you know, experiment with introduce. I'm talking jam, marble AIDS."
11:01;11:07;"All right. I mean, I have two thoughts. One is like if we did kind of like the trashy"
11:07;11:14;"version that has just like 47 variations. Yeah. A hundred percent. It would just be"
11:14;11:23;"like beef on, it'd just be like number 39, the big boy. This one's loaded with whipped"
11:23;11:32;"cream, fruit loops, Captain crunch, Hershey's chocolate syrup, and a whole banana. The potato"
11:32;11:38;"split up at this like acai bowls, except the basis batch mashed potatoes. We've scooped"
11:38;11:43;"out the baked potato. So it's just sort of the skin and it's stuffed with ice cream."
11:43;11:49;"There's something rich and potent about the image of the potato. It feels very now it"
11:49;11:55;"feels very 2022. It feels like what Gen Z is looking for. It feels like what a coalition"
11:55;11:59;"of Gen X and millennial men could definitely get some type of New York times style feature"
11:59;12:05;"about. I think this has legs. I think we have to like feel out a few things, but I think"
12:05;12:11;"there's something cool and kind of like, it's old, but it's new. And the one thing I'll"
12:11;12:17;"say is being here in Southern California, it's not exactly a hot weather dish, but I"
12:17;12:23;"could see us rolling up to say a Boston, a Minneapolis, a Toronto, a Montreal, and we're"
12:23;12:30;"posting up and we're just kind of like, it's lunchtime. It's cold. Come have this hot ass"
12:30;12:33;"baked potato. Something I like about that."
12:33;13:01;"Did I ever tell you guys, I must've told this story a long time ago, but we're in episode"
13:01;13:08;"600. So we can repeat. There's a famous place I believe is on route three in New Jersey."
13:08;13:13;"You always drive past called Pauly pizza. It's like this little shack on the highway,"
13:13;13:17;"Pauly pizza. I don't know if it's still there. It's the type of place. If you lived in Jersey,"
13:17;13:21;"you drive past it a million times. I'd never been there, but I remember my friend telling"
13:21;13:26;"me about going there and people would always say that it was owned by the mob. But as you"
13:26;13:31;"can imagine, just like in any place, people love kind of like organized crime stories"
13:31;13:38;"and especially in a place like New Jersey that famously has like the Sopranos and stuff"
13:38;13:44;"and or just the whole New York area, even going back to the Godfather and stuff. People"
13:44;13:48;"love to say stuff like that. Like, Oh, you know that that garbage truck was owned, that"
13:48;13:51;"picks up stuff. The garbage is owned by the mob. People always just said stuff like that."
13:51;13:55;"You never really knew if it was true. And our people would always say that Pauly pizza"
13:55;14:01;"was owned by the mob. Like, you know, what did I know? But then I did remember sometime"
14:01;14:04;"after that a friend of mine going and I was like, Oh, so what's the story with that place?"
14:04;14:07;"What's the vibe? And he said, well, it's just weird. We went in, they seemed a little bit"
14:07;14:12;"annoyed when I asked if they had pepperoni and they said, we only got plain pizza. And"
14:12;14:16;"I just always thought about that. Like maybe it was some kind of front, but just like rolling"
14:16;14:21;"to a pizza place and they're just like angry that you'd asked for the most basic."
14:21;14:22;"No toppings."
14:22;14:26;"He claimed that the day he walked in, they said, we got plain. What do you want? And"
14:26;14:29;"they're like, all right, I'll slice the plain. Yeah. He claimed that only had plain pizza"
14:29;14:35;"in there. I guess at a pizza place, it doesn't cost that much to, you know, buy some mushrooms"
14:35;14:40;"or something. I just wonder if there is something cool and elegant and minimalist about a place"
14:40;14:42;"that really only does one or two items."
14:42;14:46;"I feel like there's a thing of like when you're at like a fancy pizza restaurant and like"
14:46;14:50;"if I'm at like a fancy pizza restaurant with like my brother, he'll want to only get like"
14:50;14:54;"the margarita and his theory is like, I will like, I want to test it. I want to see what"
14:54;14:59;"their baseline is. Right. Like when someone like suggests getting a cheese pizza, it drives"
14:59;15:03;"me up a wall. I'm like, well, interesting. I don't care what their baseline is. Cheese"
15:03;15:08;"pizza is so boring. You got to get some olives on there. Give me something. What's your go-to"
15:08;15:17;"pizza? I like a sausage, olive sausage. I like a salty pizza, like a pep olive. Yeah."
15:17;15:21;"Onion. Just something. I mean, but Dave's always very like, we got to get the margarita"
15:21;15:25;"and was like, why? And it's like, I feel like there's this thing of like, if it's a good"
15:25;15:33;"pizza place, the margarita, AKA the plane is going to like be amazing."
15:33;15:38;"I mean, that's a very interesting point and I can see both sides of it. I mean, you know,"
15:38;15:43;"similar to like an art and music, there is a school of thought that says, take out all"
15:43;15:47;"the extraneous elements. And if, you know, people definitely say this about music."
15:47;15:48;"It's overproduced."
15:48;15:51;"If it sounds good, picking up an acoustic guitar and just singing it, you got a song"
15:51;15:58;"right there because you're not hiding behind wacky arrangements or interesting production."
15:58;16:04;"I kind of understand that idea that there's an essence to everything when you strip everything"
16:04;16:09;"away and you can truly judge the distilled version and that's where you see the truth"
16:09;16:12;"of it. So, I kind of see what Dave's saying."
16:12;16:20;"I remember arguing with a buddy of mine, Jason Anderson, when we were in college and in 1997,"
16:20;16:24;"OK Computer came out and I was like, dude, this is a step up from the Benz. I really"
16:24;16:28;"think it is. This album is incredible. And he was like, honestly, dude, don't agree,"
16:28;16:32;"man. The Benz, you can like play those songs on an acoustic guitar. They hold up the songs."
16:32;16:36;"They're classic songs. A lot of the stuff on OK, you can't really play on the guitar."
16:36;16:41;"It's not like a classic true song. I was like, dude, you're bringing like such a narrow reading"
16:41;16:46;"of this record and of like that's such an insanely restrictive criteria. And he was"
16:46;16:51;"like, dude, that's just the way it is. And we never, you know, and like we never got"
16:51;16:52;"past it. That was the end of our friendship."
16:52;16:56;"Anyway, I'm about to order a plain cheese pizza. You want in? And you're just like,"
16:56;16:57;"I'm taking a walk, man."
16:57;17:02;"Dude, I can't deal, man. Throw in some green olives and some feta. Give me, you know, give"
17:02;17:05;"me some chopped red onions. Give me something, dude."
17:05;17:10;"There's two types of people in this world. Plain cheese pizza, the Benz types and OK"
17:10;17:14;"computer sausage and olive types, let alone kid."
17:14;17:22;"Yeah, there you get into like fennel. You know, they're like when they just drop like"
17:22;17:26;"a handful of arugula like on top of the pizza once it's out of the oven. That's some kid"
17:26;17:28;"age. What about a white pizza?"
17:28;17:36;"Oh, oh, no. Good or no. I in theory good, but in practice it rarely works out. I was"
17:36;17:41;"big on white pizza in the mid to late 90s in New Jersey."
17:41;17:44;"Like is it just like Alfredo sauce? What is the white?"
17:44;17:48;"No, it's not Alfredo sauce. I think it's it's regatta."
17:48;17:50;"Wait, oh, it's just ricotta."
17:50;17:54;"Yeah, ricotta, mozzarella. And you could put something green on it. You could have a spin"
17:54;17:56;"it. A white spinach pie."
17:56;17:59;"You know, like a pesto would go really well on that."
17:59;18:04;"Oh, totally. I've done that. I've made like a pesto ricotta pizza before."
18:04;18:08;"I think you really are touching on something kind of deep, deeper than pizza is like, I"
18:08;18:11;"think it's the same with coffee."
18:11;18:15;"There's also people who would be like, I want to drink a black coffee and somebody else"
18:15;18:19;"be like, no, but I like I like the way the little bit of sugar and, you know, a little"
18:19;18:23;"bit of almond milk and they'll be like, no, no, no. All you're doing is masking the essence"
18:23;18:28;"and you're covering up for a bad product. And I guess it's kind of Dave's argument with"
18:28;18:34;"the plain pizza and Jason Anderson's argument with OK Computer. He's like, sorry, you strip"
18:34;18:40;"away all those cool sounds on OK Computer. What are you left with? Just a bunch of garbage."
18:40;18:57;"Green plastic watering can. For a fake Chinese rubber plant. And a fake plastic gun."
18:57;19:23;"She bought from a rubber man. And a town full of rubber bands. To get rid of itself."
19:23;19:52;"So when you and your brother go to dinner."
19:52;19:59;"We don't do it. Yeah, no more. We can't go to a pizza restaurant together. Is that true?"
19:59;20:04;"You wouldn't order two separate pizzas or you just you just know. I'm kidding. I mean,"
20:04;20:08;"you guys should go to Pizza Hut and get personal pens. If it was just me and Dave going to"
20:08;20:13;"a pizza restaurant and the pies were such that like we only really needed to get one."
20:13;20:17;"I would try to convince the restaurant to go half, you know, half and half like I could"
20:17;20:22;"put stuff on my half. No, but a high end restaurant's not going to do that. They're going to laugh"
20:22;20:26;"you out of there. You could do that at your local. Yeah, regular spot. You can't go to"
20:26;20:31;"a high end place and say whatever. All the names are in Italian and stuff and say they"
20:31;20:37;"don't do how to get half quattro formaggio and half half positano Bianco."
20:37;20:44;"Get the **** out of here. This came up the other day. Hannah and I went to a fancyish"
20:44;20:49;"pizza place in Pasadena and I tried to do the half move. Oh, it literally happened to"
20:49;20:53;"me. This literally happened like four days ago and the server was like, can't do halves."
20:53;20:58;"And I had this in my head. I had a full Larry David moment of like, you don't do halves."
20:58;21:03;"Why don't you do halves? What's so hard about it? Yeah, what's the what's the problem? Can"
21:03;21:09;"I talk to the chef? So we you know, we compromised. We ended up doing a sausage sausage onion."
21:09;21:17;"I love this loyalty to sausage as a topic. I need something. A plain pizza. I'm just"
21:17;21:22;"like, I can't do it. You really don't like a margarita. I don't like it. Yeah, I do like"
21:22;21:28;"a black coffee, but I don't like a margarita. That's for the next mountain breeze. The worst"
21:28;21:34;"margarita of my life. That's about being forced to eat a plain margarita pizza. Hang on a"
21:34;21:38;"second. That's a fancy pizza place. There's some stuff. There's tomato sauce. There's"
21:38;21:45;"like leaves and there's basil often. There's flavor. There's like one wilted leaf of basil"
21:45;21:50;"on the slice of margarita. And then there's like the sauce, the dried sauce. And then"
21:50;21:56;"there's one like dollop of mozz. Yeah, it's sort of just like half the slice doesn't even"
21:56;22:00;"have cheese on it. So then you just have to kind of just like roll it into like a taco"
22:00;22:04;"and just kind of like down the whole thing in two bites. Would you prefer to not eat"
22:04;22:12;"pizza than to eat a margarita pizza? Um, I mean, maybe yeah. What I prefer not to eat"
22:12;22:16;"dinner. Then I would have a margarita. No, not if you're starving. But if there was some"
22:16;22:20;"options and you're with a group of people, I would get, yeah, we get like a pasta or"
22:20;22:27;"something, you know, a sub I would get. Yeah, I'll get like a East Coast meatball grinder."
22:27;22:30;"I could totally see that group of people being like, well, there's some allergies and stuff."
22:30;22:36;"Let's just get two plain pies. And Jake's just like, I'll get a meatball grinder then."
22:36;22:43;"Okay. Yeah, I'm not down. I got a question about pizza. This is a real knock around episode"
22:43;22:49;"so far. I have to ask you guys, or does this surprise you about Jake? Who seems to me as"
22:49;22:56;"such a back to basics, simple man, you know, like a Modelo black coffee. No, but that's"
22:56;23:02;"a very interesting point because yeah, a simple man is often described as being meat and potatoes."
23:02;23:07;"What you're talking about, there's a difference between a simple man and the simplicity favored"
23:07;23:15;"by the kind of highbrow elite, which is kind of a type of minimalist simplicity. So there"
23:15;23:21;"is something that makes sense about being like a sausage guy. It's simple and straightforward."
23:21;23:27;"It's not minimalist. Yeah, dude, pizza is like a populist food form. I don't like it"
23:27;23:32;"when it minimalism is not populist. Yeah, I don't like it. I'm a regular guy. I don't"
23:32;23:36;"need much. I want to go home. I don't want to have anything on the walls. I want to have"
23:36;23:44;"mid-century Scandinavian furniture. I want white everything. I'm a regular guy. Okay."
23:44;23:52;"I'm a regular guy. I'll watch an Ingmar Bergman film. Okay. I don't like a high broke style."
23:52;23:57;"Minimalism is not minimalist necessarily. And I think it drives me insane when there's"
23:57;24:03;"just like super fancy hamburgers and pizza. I'm just like, come on. This has come up before"
24:03;24:06;"where people have been like, ""Oh, you're from Connecticut. You must think of like New Haven"
24:06;24:11;"pizza is the best."" And I'm like, ""It's good. It's fine."" Pizza, you're going to find great"
24:11;24:18;"pizza in every state, in every city. Let's not overthink this. You put a sausage on a"
24:18;24:20;"pie. I would be remiss if I didn't say I tried"
24:20;24:24;"a Chicago deep dish pizza for the first time just a couple of weeks ago."
24:24;24:28;"Were you in Chicago? No, no. I was here in Los Angeles."
24:28;24:31;"Red Baron? I can't remember the... No, it wasn't there."
24:31;24:34;"It was- No, I'm kidding. That's a frozen pizza."
24:34;24:39;"Oh, no. It was a Garfield Eats frozen deep dish pizza."
24:39;24:44;"Where were you? It was in Echo Park. It's like the one spot."
24:44;24:49;"There's a deep dish place in Echo Park? Yeah. It's like famously deep. Anyway, long"
24:49;24:52;"story short, I was not feeling it. It was like a stew."
24:52;24:56;"You have like one piece. A really deep dish, good deep dish can be"
24:56;25:01;"good. And as we've discussed a long time ago on this show, deep dish is not even necessarily"
25:01;25:07;"the favorite pizza of Chicago. Remember when we had Nihilist Arby's on and he explained"
25:07;25:12;"how if you go to your classic regular Chicago bar, they're going to have actually a very"
25:12;25:15;"tasty thin slice. Which used to be free."
25:15;25:18;"Which used to be free. He was saying like back decades ago, you go"
25:18;25:24;"to a bar and there would just be like a free kind of thin crust just hanging out."
25:24;25:28;"Right. All right. One last thing about pizza, because this was on my mind a few weeks ago."
25:28;25:34;"I was at a children's party. I was helping my child eat some pizza. They were serving"
25:34;25:39;"kind of like big, pretty big adult slices. And I was like, ""Oh, check this out. Fold"
25:39;25:43;"it and then it's kind of easier to eat."" And then across the party, I was very happy that"
25:43;25:48;"there was another Jersey dad, guy who grew up in Jersey there from across the party."
25:48;25:53;"So I'll be doing, he said, ""All right, Jersey."" And I was like, ""What?"" And he was like, ""Folding"
25:53;25:57;"the slice is a Jersey thing."" And I was like, ""Get out of here. Really?"" And he's like,"
25:57;25:59;"""I don't know. I never seen anybody doing it from anywhere else."" And I was like, ""Really?"""
25:59;26:02;"I was like, ""You grew up folding your slice."" He's like, ""Yeah, it's a Jersey thing."""
26:02;26:05;"BS. Anyway. Yeah. I take real umbrage with that."
26:05;26:06;"It's not a Jersey thing. That's universal."
26:06;26:12;"I think it's like an eating pizza thing. Right? I've never not folded my pizza."
26:12;26:16;"Yeah. That's really going out on a limb. All right. Well, Jake, you can't say anything"
26:16;26:21;"because you're from greater New Jersey. You're from the greater New Jersey area."
26:21;26:29;"I guess DC is with tri-state adjacent. Maybe people in the Midwest and California don't"
26:29;26:30;"do that."
26:30;26:32;"Yeah. See, I don't know. This doesn't get to the bottom of it because Jake is actually"
26:32;26:37;"from the New Jersey area. And then Nick, you're from DC, which is kind of like, you're actually"
26:37;26:42;"from the city, the District of Columbia, which is kind of almost like a liminal space in"
26:42;26:46;"that you have people from all over the world coming through."
26:46;26:52;"But also, by the way, that being said, the guy was right. He shouted from across a crowded"
26:52;26:55;"room, ""Jersey,"" and he was right."
26:55;26:59;"I mean, I was happy to think of it as being a Jersey thing. That suddenly took a kind"
26:59;27:06;"of mundane moment and framed it as the transmission of ancestral knowledge from father to son."
27:06;27:12;"You cross the Hudson River, they're not folding."
27:12;27:15;"It definitely seems like a New York thing, too. So maybe it's just back to it's a tri-state"
27:15;27:19;"thing. And then, Nick, you grew up down in DC. You got people from literally all over"
27:19;27:27;"the world there. So you got people from Sweden, India, Philippines, New Jersey, all coming"
27:27;27:31;"through. So you don't know which cultural traditions came from where growing up in a"
27:31;27:32;"place like that."
27:32;27:36;"You're right. I could have learned it from someone from New Jersey."
27:36;27:44;"Senator Bob Menendez. Yeah, you had Chris Christie probably coming through to go hang"
27:44;27:50;"out with the powers that be. Okay, Seinfeld, let's just get a quick number crunch. Folding"
27:50;27:52;"your pizza, where does that come from?"
27:52;27:56;"Well, Seinfeld looks at this. I'm just going to throw out to Jake, as someone with a young"
27:56;27:59;"child, you're about to find yourself at a lot of children's birthday parties where there's"
27:59;28:02;"going to be a lot of plain pizza."
28:02;28:05;"Oh, sure. Well, I mean, that's not, you know, that's..."
28:05;28:07;"You're at a kid's party. I'm not going to like make a stink about..."
28:07;28:11;"No, no, I'm not saying you're going to make a stink about it. I'm saying you're about"
28:11;28:13;"to find yourself eating a lot of margarita pizza."
28:13;28:17;"Yep. You know, if I'm at a three-year-old's birthday party, I'm going to..."
28:17;28:18;"Where are the olives?"
28:18;28:20;"I'm going to lower my standards."
28:20;28:25;"Roger, I just failed to see why you can't have a sausage and olive for the grownups."
28:25;28:31;"I mean, for every kid, there's going to be at least one adult. The math is not that hard."
28:31;28:36;"For every one plain, you get a sausage and olive. It's basic party etiquette."
28:36;28:40;"I mean, this past... Speaking of kids, this past weekend, our daughter Lizzie had her"
28:40;28:43;"first pizza and her first ice cream cone."
28:43;28:45;"Whoa. I mean, did her face just light up?"
28:45;28:49;"Yeah, the ice cream she was confused with. And then like when it kind of clicked, she"
28:49;28:53;"was just like, ""Oh, damn."" Like soft serve chocolate."
28:53;28:56;"Oh, man."
28:56;28:57;"Get out of here."
28:57;29:00;"Did she say this changes everything?"
29:00;29:01;"In her own way, yeah."
29:01;29:02;"Okay. Okay."
29:02;29:03;"Yeah."
29:03;29:08;"By like, you can bring like a fancy bottle of wine to a restaurant, like your own wine."
29:08;29:09;"Yeah."
29:09;29:15;"So could you not just bring like, carry around some nice sausages for when the occasion warrants"
29:15;29:16;"that..."
29:16;29:17;"Ask him to cut it up and throw it on the pizza."
29:17;29:18;"That's what I'm saying."
29:18;29:20;"Can you throw this in the microwave?"
29:20;29:22;"Oh, you could bring that to a children's party. Sure."
29:22;29:23;"That's what I'm saying. You could have like a bolster."
29:23;29:24;"I see."
29:24;29:31;"Where the cheese go? Where the mother's little cheese go at?"
29:31;29:43;"Aw yeah, baby. I want some. Where the cheese go? Where the cheese go at?"
29:43;29:49;"Just get your ass over here. You know what I'm sayin'? I'm sleepy."
29:49;29:54;"I been havin' these dreams. I been havin' these bad mother's little dreams."
29:54;29:57;"I'm dreamin' about the cheeses."
29:57;30:07;"Yeah, come on. I'm sorry I'm being a little irritable."
30:07;30:11;"I just don't hungry for the... Where the mother's little cheese at?"
30:11;30:13;"I need some cheese at this."
30:13;30:17;"According to Time Out New York, folding pizza dates all the way back to Italy,"
30:17;30:21;"and then in America it seems to have originated in New York."
30:21;30:24;"Okay, thoroughly researched piece by Time Out."
30:24;30:29;"Totally something you can easily back check."
30:29;30:34;"Now, if you thought that folding your pizza may have originated in France,"
30:34;30:39;"and then entered America via North Dakota, you'd be sorely mistaken."
30:39;30:42;"It's actually more of an Italy via New York thing."
30:42;30:45;"Wait, did you guys see that show ""Devs"" during the pandemic?"
30:45;30:47;"Oh yeah, I watched ""Devs."""
30:47;30:52;"And there was Nick Offerman and the other tech dudes were watching"
30:52;30:54;"""Significant Advance in Human History,"""
30:54;30:58;"and they were watching a fuzzy version of Jesus Christ being crucified."
30:58;31:04;"And then a fuzzy version of Marilyn Monroe having sex with Arthur Miller."
31:04;31:06;"Imagine Nick Offerman being like,"
31:06;31:09;"""This is the first time someone folded a slice of pizza."""
31:09;31:12;"""1502, Naples."""
31:12;31:17;"""And this is the first time someone did it in the U.S. 1957, Newark, New Jersey."""
31:17;31:18;"Wow, confirmed."
31:18;31:21;"You know what, maybe it's also like a percentage thing,"
31:21;31:24;"where of course there's going to be somebody folding it everywhere."
31:24;31:28;"Is it possible that in New Jersey or the New York area,"
31:28;31:31;"it's like 7 out of 10 people fold their slice,"
31:31;31:34;"and if you went to Boston it'd be more like 3 out of 10?"
31:34;31:36;"You think that's possible?"
31:36;31:41;"No, I think it's just a function of the thickness of the slice and the width of the slice."
31:41;31:43;"And then I think it becomes very intuitive."
31:43;31:46;"If it's a wide, thin slice, you're going to fold."
31:46;31:48;"Because otherwise, there's no structural integrity."
31:48;31:52;"You fold because the slice can kind of stand out on its own."
31:52;31:54;"Otherwise, it's just going to flop down."
31:54;31:56;"An Italian pizza is very thin."
31:56;31:59;"It's much thinner than its American counterpart."
31:59;32:00;"Right."
32:00;32:03;"I remember I went to Italy when I was 12,"
32:03;32:06;"and there was a very, very paper-thin pizza that arrived,"
32:06;32:09;"and it had a hard-boiled egg just rolling around on top of it in the box."
32:10;32:11;"I'll never forget that."
32:11;32:12;"What are you supposed to do with that?"
32:12;32:14;"You eat the hard-boiled egg first?"
32:14;32:17;"It was a white, unsliced, hard-boiled egg."
32:17;32:19;"I'll never forget the image of that box opening up"
32:19;32:22;"and just that hard-boiled egg just sort of rolling around."
32:22;32:23;"Do you guys eat it?"
32:23;32:24;"Maybe you go bite for bite?"
32:24;32:26;"I probably didn't eat it."
32:26;32:27;"Yeah, I don't know."
32:27;32:28;"Bite for bite."
32:28;32:29;"Just a cold, hard-boiled egg."
32:29;32:31;"Real dry, real mealy."
32:31;32:36;"Or is it sort of like when you get a hard-boiled egg in a Korean bibimbap dish"
32:36;32:39;"and you're supposed to maybe break it up and move it around?"
32:39;32:40;"Probably."
32:40;32:43;"Do you think that this idea was that you're supposed to cut it?"
32:43;32:46;"There was no explanation given."
32:46;32:48;"There were no instructions."
32:48;32:49;"I could have asked."
32:49;32:51;"I think I was just repulsed by the whole thing."
32:51;32:55;"Did you or your family just throw it away and then eat the pizza?"
32:55;32:57;"Well, it was my uncle who lives in Italy,"
32:57;32:59;"and I think he was very matter-of-fact."
32:59;33:03;"Like, yeah, that's the standard starter kit pizza thing here."
33:03;33:05;"But it was a long time ago."
33:05;33:08;"This is either the worst episode of Time Crisis or the best."
33:08;33:10;"[laughter]"
33:10;33:14;"I mean, we've definitely achieved the show rules status here."
33:14;33:17;"Matt's going to cut this thing down to three minutes."
33:17;33:20;"We also haven't--by the way, we didn't even get to the thing we said--"
33:20;33:23;"we didn't even get to the thing we said we were going to start with."
33:23;33:24;"Let's get to it."
33:24;33:27;"Hold on, but it's one last thing, one last pizza thing."
33:27;33:29;"Another 10 minutes on pizza. Don't worry."
33:29;33:32;"It's just like after we finish this episode,"
33:32;33:34;"it's going to talk to our significant others."
33:34;33:35;"How was the show?"
33:35;33:36;"Good."
33:36;33:38;"Talked about pizza."
33:38;33:41;"Like, has something happened recently with pizza?"
33:41;33:47;"No, we just talked about pizza, toppings, how you like to eat it."
33:47;33:49;"Kids' parties, folding it."
33:49;33:54;"Just the most basic stuff about pizza."
33:54;33:57;"Okay, the one thing we haven't talked about on this show,"
33:57;34:00;"which kind of was a major Time Crisis-y event this year,"
34:00;34:04;"is that they brought back the Mexican pizza at Taco Bell."
34:04;34:06;"I don't think we've talked about this at all."
34:06;34:09;"And one of the ways they announced it--"
34:09;34:11;"Can you double-check this?"
34:11;34:13;"Because as I say, it doesn't sound true."
34:13;34:15;"But I'm pretty sure one of the ways they announced it"
34:15;34:20;"was by letting Doja Cat do the honors during her Coachella set."
34:20;34:22;"What the hell?"
34:22;34:23;"Do the honors."
34:23;34:27;"And I think--I assume she was the headliner because she's huge--"
34:27;34:29;"that in the middle of her Coachella set,"
34:29;34:34;"Coachella's become such a major media event."
34:34;34:39;"Think about when Beyonce headlined Coachella three, four years ago."
34:39;34:43;"It was this major moment, millions of people watching at home."
34:43;34:47;"She even released an album and a movie about it."
34:47;34:51;"So it's like there was a while where headlining Coachella"
34:51;34:55;"felt like this kind of major artistic platform."
34:55;34:59;"And when I heard that Doja Cat announced"
34:59;35:02;"the return of the Mexican pizza during her set,"
35:02;35:05;"I was just like, ""That rules. I love this."""
35:05;35:08;"This is like fully Andy Warhol sh*t."
35:08;35:10;"Okay, so Seinfeld, first of all, is this true?"
35:10;35:11;"Do I have it slightly wrong?"
35:11;35:12;"You nailed it."
35:12;35:16;"On April 17th, Doja took the main stage at Coachella"
35:16;35:20;"before the weekend at Swedish House Mafia's headlining set,"
35:20;35:22;"which Jake, you were there for that, right?"
35:22;35:25;"Okay, so not quite headlining, but still a major second from the top."
35:25;35:26;"It's pretty big."
35:26;35:29;"Right. So during her performance, she announced that on May 19th,"
35:29;35:32;"Taco Bell will bring back its Mexican pizza,"
35:32;35:35;"a fan-favorite item that was discontinued 2020."
35:35;35:37;"The singer dropped the news while singing a snippet"
35:37;35:39;"of an unreleased new song."
35:39;35:44;"She said, ""I brought back the Mexican pizza, by the way,"" to the crowd."
35:44;35:47;"But I have to say there's some more context on this."
35:47;35:50;"Doja, you know she's an internet troll."
35:50;35:52;"She's been tweeting at what you call--"
35:52;35:53;"Taco Bell."
35:53;35:54;"Thank you."
35:54;35:59;"To bring back the Mexican pizza since September 3rd, 2020."
35:59;36:02;"And there's been this-- and again, it's complicated,"
36:02;36:04;"but I know there's been some TikTok stuff."
36:04;36:06;"This has been one of her things."
36:06;36:08;"I don't know if this was organic, if she just thought it would be funny,"
36:08;36:11;"and then the marketing geniuses at Taco Bell said,"
36:11;36:13;"""This is lightning in a bottle,"""
36:13;36:19;"or if this was a long-run, slow build"
36:19;36:22;"to this Coachella moment, like this was a two-year contract."
36:22;36:24;"Wow, I'd be so curious."
36:24;36:26;"Right, because I could really picture either."
36:26;36:29;"Yeah, Doja Cat seems funny."
36:29;36:31;"She could be kind of just creating her own memes,"
36:31;36:33;"and you could just picture her just hanging out being like,"
36:33;36:35;"""How come they don't have the Mexican pizza anymore?"""
36:35;36:37;"And then just tweeting at Taco Bell."
36:37;36:41;"And then you could picture all the people working at Taco Bell social media"
36:41;36:45;"like, ""Holy s***, Doja Cat just tweeted at us."
36:45;36:47;"They're having an emergency meeting."
36:47;36:49;"How do we respond? What do we do with this?"""
36:49;36:53;"Somebody makes a presentation at corporate saying, ""Let's bring it back."""
36:53;36:55;"And maybe it was organic in that sense,"
36:55;36:59;"but also in this fake news era, it's hard to trust anybody."
36:59;37:01;"Don't know what's real."
37:01;37:04;"And you could kind of also picture somebody at Taco Bell saying,"
37:04;37:07;"""Let's have some fun bringing back the Mexican pizza."
37:07;37:09;"Let's turn it into a bit of a meme."
37:09;37:11;"How do we do that?"""
37:11;37:14;"And somebody would say, ""Let's get a celebrity or somebody"
37:14;37:17;"to kind of organically seed this."""
37:17;37:19;"And somebody's like, ""All right, who's big?"""
37:19;37:21;"And somebody's like, ""BTS."""
37:21;37:23;"And they're like, ""Nah, it should be a solo artist."""
37:23;37:26;"And somebody's like, ""The Weeknd."""
37:26;37:28;"""Eh, he's a little too serious."""
37:28;37:30;"All right, somebody more fun."
37:30;37:33;"Maybe like a Katy Perry."
37:33;37:35;"She already has some obligations."
37:35;37:37;"Okay, somebody newer."
37:37;37:39;"Doja Cat. Everybody looks at each other like,"
37:39;37:42;"""F***ing Doja Cat. This is a brilliant idea."
37:42;37:44;"We're going to bring back the Mexican pizza with Doja Cat."
37:44;37:47;"Let's kick her a cool $10 million a year"
37:47;37:49;"for the next few years."
37:49;37:51;"Does a little tweeting."
37:51;37:53;"Maybe it culminates at Coachella."""
37:53;37:55;"I really don't know. Both are very plausible."
37:55;37:57;"Katy Perry's wrapped up."
37:57;38:00;"She's doing a promo for Arby's curly fries at Coachella."
38:00;38:03;"Also, didn't Doja Cat do a Pepsi commercial"
38:03;38:06;"for Super Bowl Pepsi commercial?"
38:06;38:08;"Doesn't Pepsi own Taco Bell?"
38:08;38:10;"Oh, that's the same company. Yum Brands."
38:10;38:12;"I think that's been spot off at this point."
38:12;38:15;"I don't think they're under the same corporate roof."
38:15;38:18;"I think we have audio though of the Doja Cat"
38:18;38:20;"Mexican pizza unveiling. I'd love to hear it."
38:20;38:24;"I brought back the Mexican pizza, by the way."
38:24;38:28;"Over the guitar solo."
38:28;38:30;"It's like mid-song."
38:30;38:32;"Play that one more time."
38:32;38:34;"I brought back the Mexican pizza."
38:34;38:35;"Oh, that rules."
38:35;38:38;"I brought back the Mexican pizza, by the way."
38:38;38:40;"Sounds like Rage Against the Machine."
38:40;38:46;"It kind of sounds like Faith No More."
38:46;38:52;"Oh my God, I love the idea of your second version of this."
38:52;38:56;"Where this is this highly discussed,"
38:56;38:59;"generated, Wieden-Kennedy meeting"
38:59;39:01;"with the Taco Bell people."
39:01;39:03;"""Let's get Doja Cat. Everybody's really excited."""
39:03;39:06;"""It's going to cost $20 million."""
39:06;39:08;"And then they watch this and they go,"
39:08;39:10;"""I brought back the Mexican pizza!"""
39:10;39:11;"And that's it."
39:11;39:13;"And they don't know it's going to go big."
39:13;39:14;"And those who are like,"
39:14;39:16;"""I can't believe what we just wasted our f***ing money on."""
39:16;39:17;"This is the worst."
39:17;39:20;"You know, if you heard that, you'd be mortified."
39:20;39:22;"If you're paying for it, it needs to be"
39:22;39:25;"discreet banter between songs."
39:25;39:27;"Yeah, but you know what's hilarious?"
39:27;39:29;"You could totally picture an actual corporate contract"
39:29;39:31;"where the lawyers are going back and forth"
39:31;39:34;"and it's just like, the client will"
39:34;39:36;"talk about the Mexican pizza"
39:36;39:38;"during their Coachella set."
39:38;39:40;"The client will not do it"
39:40;39:42;"over any type of loud music,"
39:42;39:44;"guitar solo or not."
39:44;39:47;"There will be silence in between songs."
39:47;39:50;"Like, they might actually get into that stuff."
39:50;39:52;"You didn't fulfill the contract, Doja."
39:52;39:53;"You just yelled it over a guitar solo."
39:53;39:56;"You were supposed to solemnly step to the mic"
39:56;39:58;"between two songs and say,"
39:58;40:00;"""Hey, Coachella."
40:00;40:02;"Just want to let you know I brought back the Mexican pizza."
40:02;40:04;"Make some f***ing noise."""
40:04;40:05;"But I guess it worked anyway."
40:05;40:07;"And just to clarify,"
40:07;40:09;"the Mexican pizza did come back"
40:09;40:11;"and Taco Bell's are now overrun"
40:11;40:13;"with people trying to get their hands on a Mexican pizza?"
40:13;40:15;"Not only did it come back, but"
40:15;40:18;"you know, Dolly Parton got involved in this too, right?"
40:18;40:20;"Okay, interesting."
40:20;40:21;"What's her role in this?"
40:21;40:23;"Like many across the nation,"
40:23;40:26;"Dolly Parton has been awaiting the return of"
40:26;40:28;"Taco Bell's Mexican pizza."
40:28;40:31;"She did a video where she ate the pizza on Instagram."
40:31;40:34;"She said, ""I've been longing for this moment for so long."
40:34;40:35;"It's finally here."""
40:35;40:37;"And then she opens a mini pizza box,"
40:37;40:40;"takes it in, and then she said,"
40:40;40:44;"""Oh, that looks almost too good to eat, but I'm gonna."""
40:44;40:45;"So, I mean, this Mexican pizza,"
40:45;40:48;"it's cross-generational."
40:48;40:50;"It's, you know..."
40:50;40:52;"Was anybody else involved?"
40:52;40:53;"Did somebody talk about..."
40:53;40:55;"They actually did some market research and said,"
40:55;40:58;"""The best type of spokesperson for the Mexican pizza"
40:58;41:01;"will be a female pop star."""
41:01;41:03;"And the guys in corporate are just kind of like,"
41:03;41:05;"""Alright, so, you know, somebody young."""
41:05;41:06;"It's like, ""Well, that's what's interesting."
41:06;41:08;"We think we should tag team this."
41:08;41:09;"It's gotta be a female pop star,"
41:09;41:11;"but we want somebody from the older generation,"
41:11;41:12;"somebody from the younger."""
41:12;41:13;"Okay."
41:13;41:16;"So, we're thinking Doja Cat and Dolly Parton."
41:16;41:18;"Alright, great one-two punch."
41:18;41:20;"That about covers your bases."
41:20;41:21;"Pretty much."
41:21;41:22;"And I guess it worked."
41:22;41:25;"Okay, Taco Bell is owned by Yum! Brands."
41:25;41:26;"Oh, it is? Okay."
41:26;41:27;"Going down a rabbit hole here."
41:27;41:29;"It's possible Doja Cat has some sort of"
41:29;41:31;"overall deal with Yum! Brands."
41:31;41:34;"Where she does a little bit of pizza,"
41:34;41:35;"a little bit of Pepsi."
41:35;41:39;"In '97, Tricon Global Restaurants bought Taco Bell,"
41:39;41:43;"and then they rebranded in 2002 to become Yum!"
42:30;42:32;"Part of the reason I was interested in this is,"
42:32;42:35;"I talked to somebody a month or two ago"
42:35;42:38;"to a Dua Lipa concert,"
42:38;42:40;"and they told me that during the concert"
42:40;42:42;"there was some sort of commercial."
42:42;42:44;"The way they explained it,"
42:44;42:45;"I'm only half remembering it,"
42:45;42:49;"but it was not necessarily that Dua Lipa"
42:49;42:51;"went to the mic and said,"
42:51;42:53;"""Hey everybody, as you know,"
42:53;42:55;"when I'm not singing or dancing,"
42:55;42:57;"I like to stay in shape."""
42:57;42:59;"It wasn't that kind of thing."
42:59;43:02;"But I think maybe the way they described it,"
43:02;43:03;"because it's a big pop show"
43:03;43:04;"and there's many costume changes,"
43:04;43:05;"there might have been a moment"
43:05;43:06;"when she walked off stage"
43:06;43:09;"and then something came on the video screen"
43:09;43:11;"for a beverage or something like that."
43:11;43:13;"So that was interesting to hear about."
43:13;43:15;"Then I heard about the Doja Cat thing,"
43:15;43:19;"and I was like, ""Oh, is this a fun new thing happening?"""
43:19;43:21;"Advertising during concerts,"
43:21;43:23;"which obviously would be very TC."
43:23;43:25;"A fun new thing."
43:25;43:26;"I'd love to get in on that."
43:26;43:28;"I mean, I don't hate it because"
43:28;43:30;"I like the old-fashioned,"
43:30;43:33;"now word from our sponsors type thing."
43:33;43:36;"I feel like I could pull that off on stage,"
43:36;43:38;"just kind of like end a song"
43:38;43:39;"and just be like,"
43:39;43:41;"start cooking up a fun little groove"
43:41;43:42;"and just be like,"
43:42;43:44;"""Are you looking for an iced tea"
43:44;43:46;"that's going to give you some bang for your buck?"
43:46;43:49;"Don't forget about 99 Cent Arizona Iced Tea."""
43:49;43:51;"I think you could do that in a kind of fun way."
43:51;43:52;"But have you guys heard about this?"
43:52;43:54;"Is this kind of a growing trend?"
43:54;43:55;"Well, yeah."
43:55;43:57;"When I was at the Pavement show two weeks ago,"
43:57;43:58;"it was weird."
43:58;44:00;"Steve Malthemus did very little banter,"
44:00;44:03;"but he did a whole thing about Panera Bread."
44:03;44:05;"And that how he had like,"
44:05;44:07;"on a day off, he had like,"
44:07;44:08;"it was very organic."
44:08;44:09;"He had just like,"
44:09;44:11;"they were at like a weird, you know, stop"
44:11;44:12;"and they had to get gas"
44:12;44:13;"and he like,"
44:13;44:14;"ended up in a Panera Bread"
44:14;44:16;"and ended up having like a really creative,"
44:16;44:17;"really productive writing session"
44:17;44:19;"on his laptop in a Panera Bread."
44:19;44:20;"And I thought it was weird"
44:20;44:23;"and he kept saying Panera Bread."
44:23;44:24;"Panera."
44:24;44:26;"And now, hearing you talk about this,"
44:26;44:27;"I'm wondering if..."
44:27;44:28;"It's a trend."
44:28;44:29;"Pavement's on the payroll, I mean."
44:29;44:31;"Stephen Malthemus also recited"
44:31;44:34;"the MattDamonCrypto.com commercial,"
44:34;44:35;"line for line."
44:35;44:38;"Got all the middle-aged indie fans"
44:38;44:40;"really f***ing psyched about making history"
44:40;44:41;"with their crypto investments."
44:41;44:42;"It's just the perfect time too."
44:42;44:44;"I mean, crypto's doing great."
44:44;44:45;"Well, by the dip."
44:45;44:47;"Well, I think, you know,"
44:47;44:50;"Ezra, when we were at the Pearl Jam show too,"
44:50;44:51;"wasn't there like,"
44:51;44:53;"Eddie Vedder was going kind of off"
44:53;44:54;"about Red Lobster at one point?"
44:57;44:59;"Eddie really chilled out a lot since the 90s."
44:59;45:01;"He used to just go on and on about that stuff."
45:01;45:02;"But yeah."
45:02;45:04;"Somehow I ended up on a page"
45:04;45:07;"of discontinued Taco Bell menu items."
45:07;45:08;"Yeah?"
45:08;45:10;"I'm just going to read some of these."
45:10;45:11;"The Bell Burger."
45:11;45:12;"Whoa."
45:12;45:13;"The Bell Beefer."
45:13;45:16;"The Bell Burger?"
45:16;45:18;"That was a straight up a hamburger at Taco Bell?"
45:18;45:19;"Beefy Crunch Burrito,"
45:19;45:21;"Beefy Melt Burrito,"
45:21;45:22;"Seafood Salad."
45:22;45:23;"Ooh."
45:23;45:25;"Volcano Taco."
45:25;45:27;"I had the Volcano Taco."
45:27;45:29;"I went out of my way to get a Volcano."
45:29;45:30;"That wasn't that long ago."
45:30;45:32;"Was it shaped like a volcano?"
45:32;45:33;"What makes it a volcano?"
45:33;45:36;"These don't have discreet Wikipedia pages, Seinfeld,"
45:36;45:38;"so I can't help you just on the fly here."
45:38;45:39;"I can tell you."
45:39;45:40;"I remember it."
45:40;45:43;"It was basically a regular degular Taco Bell hard taco"
45:43;45:45;"with the ground beef,"
45:45;45:48;"the little stringy yellow cheese,"
45:48;45:50;"the kind of unpleasant lettuce,"
45:50;45:52;"all that sh*t."
45:52;45:56;"Except the taco was red and a little spicy."
45:56;45:59;"That's what made it a Volcano Taco."
45:59;46:02;"And so you can imagine"
46:02;46:04;"the Taco Bell Burger"
46:04;46:07;"was more of a sloppy Joe."
46:07;46:08;"Okay."
46:08;46:09;"More of a grinder."
46:09;46:10;"But that would make sense."
46:10;46:12;"It's using their taco meat."
46:12;46:14;"Here's something that sounds absolutely insane."
46:14;46:17;"Chicken Caesar Grilled Stuff Burrito."
46:17;46:19;"Do you guys remember the grilled stuff?"
46:19;46:20;"That sounds really good."
46:20;46:21;"I begged to differ."
46:21;46:22;"That sounds great."
46:22;46:25;"Stuffed spelled S-T-U-F-T."
46:25;46:26;"Yes."
46:26;46:28;"S-T-U-F-T."
46:28;46:31;"I definitely had some grilled stuff burritos like 20 years ago."
46:31;46:32;"They weren't bad, right?"
46:32;46:34;"They were real saucy."
46:34;46:38;"Chipotle Chicken Loaded Griller."
46:38;46:39;"Wait, fully loaded?"
46:39;46:40;"God, the names."
46:40;46:45;"Chipotle Chicken doesn't specify loaded or fully or semi,"
46:45;46:47;"just loaded griller."
46:47;46:49;"The double decker taco was a good one."
46:49;46:50;"Oh, yeah."
46:50;46:53;"Cool Ranch and Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos."
46:53;46:55;"Ooh, that sounds good."
46:55;46:57;"Power Menu Burrito."
46:57;46:58;"Power Menu."
46:58;47:00;"And the Double XL Grilled Stuff Burrito."
47:00;47:03;"Power Menu, is that for power brokers,"
47:03;47:07;"like the C-suite business types on the go?"
47:07;47:08;"Yeah."
47:08;47:09;"Is it like the Arch Deluxe?"
47:09;47:10;"It's for a power lunch."
47:10;47:11;"Definitely."
47:11;47:12;"Yeah."
47:12;47:15;"Oh, I'm sad to see the seven layers not available anymore."
47:15;47:17;"That was my go-to, the seven-layer burrito,"
47:17;47:20;"kind of like, you know, the sort of like veggie burrito."
47:20;47:22;"Yeah, seven layer was classic."
47:22;47:23;"That was a classic."
47:23;47:25;"That's real like '90s, early '90s."
47:25;47:28;"I would say early '2s too, like touring,"
47:28;47:31;"like hitting like a Taco Bell in like Napa, Idaho,"
47:31;47:35;"getting that like seven layer for like $1.99."
47:35;47:38;"The seven layer was the Gen X go-to,"
47:38;47:42;"and I remember Primus, they had a hit song in the '90s."
47:42;47:45;"Primus, one of the weirdest bands of all time"
47:45;47:47;"that was ever kind of like mainstream."
47:47;47:50;"Yeah. I mean, how the hell, man?"
47:50;47:52;"Primus was truly on some wild sh*t."
47:52;47:54;"Primus has platinum albums."
47:54;47:55;"Can we listen to some Primus?"
47:55;47:57;"Well, the song I'm thinking of is,"
47:57;47:59;"why known as Big Brown Beaver."
47:59;48:00;"Uh-huh."
48:00;48:02;"I kind of remember there being a line in it"
48:02;48:04;"where Les Claypool goes,"
48:04;48:06;"""Something smells like seven layers,"
48:06;48:08;"that beaver eats Taco Bell."""
48:08;48:10;"There definitely, of course, that he picked seven layers,"
48:10;48:13;"because that was kind of like the funny menu item"
48:13;48:15;"to talk about in the '90s."
48:15;48:20;"Also, if you're like a poor vegetarian indie rocker,"
48:20;48:22;"not that Les was at that point,"
48:22;48:24;"but he was hip to the scene."
48:24;48:28;"He was hip to the Bay Area punk, Gilman Street-based scene."
48:28;48:29;"Right."
48:29;48:30;"Dudes were hitting the seven layer."
48:30;48:31;"Matt, throw that on."
48:31;48:34;"I just want to throw out that"
48:34;48:37;"here's like a really interesting little Taco Bell tidbit"
48:37;48:40;"that Glenn Bell, the founder of Taco Bell,"
48:40;48:42;"invented the crunchy hard taco."
48:42;48:46;"Like when you're making taco Tuesdays for your kid,"
48:46;48:47;"that sort of--"
48:47;48:49;"Like the old El Paso hard shell?"
48:49;48:50;"Yeah, he invented that."
48:50;48:51;"Huh."
48:51;48:53;"I mean, this definitely doesn't seem traditional."
48:53;48:55;"You just fry it and it hardens."
48:55;48:56;"It's like a chip."
48:56;48:58;"It is, but it's just like,"
48:58;49:03;"that seems like a fairly important staple of the home."
49:03;49:09;"Jake, are you a Primus fan?"
49:09;49:11;"No, man, they were always too--"
49:11;49:14;"I had the Sailing on the Caesar Cheese record."
49:14;49:16;"I had that and I had Pork Soda,"
49:16;49:18;"which is one of the great album titles."
49:18;49:31;"That was it."
49:31;49:33;"Smelled like seven layers."
49:33;49:35;"That beaver eats Taco Bell."
49:35;49:40;"It's insane this band was so big."
49:40;49:42;"It's a great story."
49:42;49:44;"It's a real win for the weirdos."
49:44;49:47;"Yeah, only in the early '90s, man."
49:47;49:49;"'Cause Primus is like somewhere in between"
49:49;49:51;"Rage Against the Machine,"
49:51;49:53;"Fish,"
49:53;49:54;"Ween,"
49:55;49:56;"Cake,"
49:56;49:57;"Zappa,"
49:57;49:58;"Yeah."
49:58;50:01;"And just like some kind of, yeah, comedy."
50:01;50:03;"They did the South Park theme."
50:03;50:04;"Famously, yeah."
50:04;50:08;"It's perfect for like 13-year-old boys"
50:08;50:10;"in like 1993."
50:10;50:14;"Matt and Trey said about the South Park song,"
50:14;50:17;"""Best $2,000 I ever spent."""
50:17;50:18;"Wow."
50:18;50:20;"The cultural impact of that theme song"
50:20;50:23;"for $2,000 is wild."
50:23;50:26;"Now, what was Primus' biggest song?"
50:26;50:29;"Was it ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""?"
50:29;50:31;"I feel like it was, yeah."
50:31;50:33;"Can we throw on ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""?"
50:34;50:36;"Fire up, man!"
50:36;50:42;"Where's the biggest intersection of the Venn diagram?"
50:42;50:44;"Is it Primus and Ween?"
50:44;50:47;"You think like Tool fans like Primus?"
50:47;50:49;"I mean, this does kind of rule."
50:49;50:50;"This rules."

01:01:11;01:01:12;"That is a great point,"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"because Seinfeld was majority filmed on an L.A. soundstage,"

01:01:18;01:01:19;"But you know what?"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"I think this gets to a deeper question,"

01:01:27;01:01:29;"I know it's different in different places,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"but famously, people always say"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"that the New York tap water is great."
01:01:34;01:01:37;"And even when I remember being in New Jersey,"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"I was under the assumption that the tap water was good."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"So, yeah, 100% when I was a kid,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"if I wanted a glass of water,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"I would drink it out of the kitchen sink."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"At some point, I have a memory of my family"
01:01:48;01:01:52;"upgrading to a new fridge that had the water thing in the fridge."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"It felt like kind of a big deal at the time."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"And then I would drink water out of that."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"But that would still be tap water."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"Yeah, maybe there's some type of filter in there."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"But, yeah, clearly something changed."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"And I think starting in the late '90s,"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"suddenly everybody had Brita filters."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"And this 100% has crossed my mind before"

01:02:36;01:02:38;"It's clearly filthy."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"And you know you're supposed to replace that filter every few months."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"And clearly the filter hasn't been replaced in years."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"I mean, this might have been more of an early 2000s phenomenon."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"But I remember just kind of like at some point"

01:03:05;01:03:08;"""Oh, okay, great, it's filtered in the Brita."""
01:03:08;01:03:10;"But then just like, ""Wait, what is going on?"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"How did I get this in my head that this piece of plastic"

01:03:21;01:03:23;"And I don't know the answer."
01:03:23;01:03:28;"It's possible that even the nasty Brita was cleaner water."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"But I'm starting to wonder,"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"is this like one of those things you read about"

01:03:49;01:03:51;"And then at some point,"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"even like weird nasty people"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"would only drink out of a funky Brita."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"- And then this is even,"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"well, this, like the email raises the question"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"that's one step further,"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"which is individualized bottles of water."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"- Yes."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"- I remember when that really,"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"yeah, maybe like 20 years ago,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"became like almost like a default"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"where like you'd go to people's houses"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"and they'd have like a case of like water,"
01:04:15;01:04:19;"like individualized, like eight ounce bottles of water."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"Or like I used to do grocery delivery."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- That's a real Costco."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"- And I was just like, ""What is going on?"""
01:04:26;01:04:29;"I always drank tap water and I still do."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"I don't use a Brita and I don't buy bottled water."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"- Okay, and even in Los Angeles,"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"which is not famous for great tap water."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"- I think the water's fine."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"It tastes good to me."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"- It's fine."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"- I fill up my big 40 ounce water bottle"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"in the sink every morning at our house."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"- No Brita, no nothing."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- No."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"- So it does seem like there was some sort of like push"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"from the bottled water companies"
01:04:52;01:04:56;"to make tap water seem unclean."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"By the year 2000,"
01:04:57;01:05:00;"tap water was engaged in a war with bottled water."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"Beverage companies were playing on consumer fears"
01:05:03;01:05:06;"of contamination and illness from tap sources."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"One of the key players in this war was Brita Filters,"
01:05:09;01:05:12;"which further alleges that toilet and tap water"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"came from the same source."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Come on Brita."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"(laughing)"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"- Whoa."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"- Yeah."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- I guess, did we talk about this ever on the show?"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"Like, I mean, yeah, what a moment."
01:05:21;01:05:25;"And I guess the problem is, tap water has no real advocate."
01:05:25;01:05:26;"It's an open goal."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"- It's old school."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"It's an old school public resource."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"- Who's gonna defend the tap water?"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"Bernie Sanders?"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"- Yeah."
01:05:36;01:05:40;"I remember in 2008, I did an experiment."
01:05:40;01:05:43;"I went on a five day camping trip"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"out in the desert with my brother."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"And we were, it wasn't like backpacking."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"So we would like, we drove down to Anza Borrego."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"We stayed there for a night."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"We drove over to Joshua Tree."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"We were there."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"We drove over to Death Valley."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"We were there."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"And I was like, okay, picture this is like 1970."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Like 1971."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"And we're doing this same trip."
01:05:59;01:06:03;"And like in 1971, I don't think you could like drive"
01:06:03;01:06:07;"into any random gas station and just buy bottled water."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"I don't think that was like a thing that was stocked."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"And so I was like, well, what did people do?"
01:06:13;01:06:16;"They would bring like a gallon jug or water bottles"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"and like fill up at hotels or gas stations."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"So I was like, this is what I'm gonna do."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"I'm not gonna buy any water on this trip."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"And this is 2008."
01:06:24;01:06:28;"And I remember going into an AM PM in the most like desolate,"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"like weird desert intersection."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"And it was like 105 degrees."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"And like you walk in and you get, you like,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"like the doors part as you walk into the AM PM."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"And there's like that blast of AC, right?"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"And you go and there's like the whole,"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"there's the wall of just like the refrigerated beverages,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"Gatorade, Powerade."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Then like three doors full of like different options"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"for bottled water."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"And I was like, Hey, do you guys,"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"I remember going to the cashier and be like, Hey,"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"do you guys have like a tap or something?"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"I can fill up my gallon jug with."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"And the guy was like, no."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"And then I was like, okay."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"Then I went outside and I went around to the back of the AM PM"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"and I found a hose spigot."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"And I took like two empty gallon jugs"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"and just filled up the water bottles"
01:07:12;01:07:16;"with like the like weird AM PM hose spigot water,"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"which was fine."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Didn't taste great."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"And out there in the desert,"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"like it might be kind of like full of weird minerals"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"or something, but I was just like,"
01:07:25;01:07:29;"this is insane that you can't just like go to a place,"
01:07:29;01:07:32;"especially in the desert and just get water for free"
01:07:32;01:07:36;"or like fill it up with containers that you have with you"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"in your car."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"- Wow. I love this, Jake."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"This could be like a great documentary"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"because people always do this stuff."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"It's getting a little bit played out where somebody is like,"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"we tried to live off the grid for a year."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"We decided to reduce our carbon footprint for a year."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"How about just straight up?"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"I'm just like a regular dude"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"and I'm just trying to just drink tap water for a year."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"- And you're on the road,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"like let's say you're a truck driver"
01:07:59;01:08:03;"and like you're stopping into like the Flying J travel plaza"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"in Gillette, Wyoming."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"- There's always the bathroom."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"If you had been in that position in the AM PM,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"would you have filled it up in the sink in the bathroom?"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"- Well, but it was hard to get the gallon jug"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"into the sink."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"You could fill up like a smaller amount."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- What about the toilet?"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"'Cause the water comes from the same source."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"- I wouldn't want to fill up."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"According to Britta,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"you might as well just dunk it in the toilet."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"- Just scoop it up."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"- That's truly next level."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"There's like a, sir, there's a man in there"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"filling gallon jugs of water out of the toilet."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"- Honestly, that's like the third act,"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"starting the third act of the movie."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"(laughing)"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Is Jake and Apollo."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"- I'm about to do it, man."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"I'm about to do it."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- So thirsty."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"- There's nothing more refreshing than having a clear,"
01:08:48;01:08:54;"crisp, clean glass of water on a warm summer's day."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"- That cool, refreshing drink."

01:10:00;01:10:03;"I will fill up multiple water bottles at the house."
01:10:03;01:10:06;"'Cause I just, I hate being in that situation"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"of like, you're like two hours into a drive."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"You're like, ""Damn, I'm thirsty."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"""I've just been drinking coffee all morning."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"""I need to drink water."""
01:10:14;01:10:16;"And then like going in and just buying"
01:10:16;01:10:20;"that like liter of like Poland Springs or whatever."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"- Yeah."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- And then it just, you drink it"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"and then like that bottle's just rattling around"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"in your car for another month and you,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"and then it just goes into the recycling bin."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"It just feels bad."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"I just, buying a bottle of water feels terrible."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"So when Noam sent this email."
01:10:33;01:10:36;"- It's not cool, but one thing that's interesting to me."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"- It's not cool, man."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"- It's not cool, man."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"One thing that's interesting to me"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"is that clearly something changed in the nineties"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"and maybe Jerry was a little bit ahead of the curve."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"He's very, Jerry also famously bit of like"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"a germaphobe neat freak."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"So you could picture like a Jerry Seinfeld guy."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"Suddenly there's bottle Walker on the market"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"and Jerry Seinfeld being like,"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"""I've been waiting my whole life for this."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"""Oh God, finally, straight from the factory."""
01:11:01;01:11:02;"- Totally."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- And he probably even liked it"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"that now his guests don't have to touch his glasses."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"That might be appealing to kind of like"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"a germaphobe neat freak."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"But one thing that's interesting to me is that"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"since 2008, certainly since the nineties,"
01:11:14;01:11:18;"the personal water bottle has exploded."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"So way more people are,"
01:11:20;01:11:23;"share your concern about not wasting plastic bottles."
01:11:23;01:11:27;"So many kids are always walking around with their bottles."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"I can't remember, there's an Adam Sandler bit"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"from like a special he did a few years ago"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"where the whole joke was like,"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"""I get my kids in the car."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"""Their mom says, 'Don't forget the water bottles.'"
01:11:38;01:11:42;"""And my kids say, 'Daddy, daddy, where's my water bottle?'"""
01:11:42;01:11:43;"And I think, ""What the hell?"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"""When I was a kid, I didn't drink water for three days."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"""No one cared."""
01:11:47;01:11:50;"Basically he's doing like an Adam Sandler bit about-"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"- I mean, it's true though."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"- Yeah, I guess that's, well,"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"so suddenly everybody's hydration conscious."
01:11:55;01:11:59;"Everybody is also don't waste plastic bottles conscious."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"And yet I think the domino that has not fallen"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"is that all these people walking around"
01:12:04;01:12:08;"with their metal thermoses or their Camelbacks,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"their Nalteans, all that stuff."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Still, if you told them,"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"""Yeah, go around to the back of the AM/PM"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"""and fill her up with the spigot back there,"""
01:12:18;01:12:19;"would not do it."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"And is that because they've been brainwashed"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"by this nefarious Britta campaign?"
01:12:26;01:12:27;"Is it because there's a grain of truth?"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"I don't know."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"I mean, I wonder if Jake,"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"if you have a more robust immune system"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"because you've just been raw dog and water"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"for the past 20 years."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"In fact, you never got COVID, did you?"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"- I haven't gotten COVID."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"- Okay, well guys-"
01:12:39;01:12:40;"- Not that I know of."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"It's very possible I got it."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"- I just concluded a study and from my,"
01:12:43;01:12:44;"based on my findings,"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"100% of the people in the study"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"who've been raw dog and water for the past 20 years"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"have not gotten COVID."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"I think that's pretty interesting."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"- Well, there you go."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- Wow."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"I'm on the website for science,"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"the respected medical journal,"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"which I just read."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"It's actually my homepage."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"- And the respected concept."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"- That's right."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Yeah, that's true."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Oh, very empirical."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"And apparently from '82 to 2015,"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"somewhere between 9 million and 45 million Americans"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"got drinking water from a source"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"that was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act"
01:13:16;01:13:21;"that was brought to life by the Flint, Michigan crisis."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"They started looking into it."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"- Well, that, yeah, clearly out of control."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"- Right."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"Bottom line being that in rural and lower income areas,"
01:13:28;01:13:31;"your water is less safe to drink from the tap"
01:13:31;01:13:34;"because they just don't have the proper filtration system."
01:13:34;01:13:38;"So maybe in a Joshua tree, it's rural for sure."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"So maybe the water is less safe out there."
01:13:41;01:13:45;"But it seems like Brita and the powerful bottled water lobbies,"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"the Nestle's and whoever,"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"probably seized on some of that vulnerability"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"and then used that to turn the tide"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"and turn us into a British nation."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"- Well, yeah, I think that, look, there's a truth."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"- We know that the Flint, Michigan stuff is true, yes."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"- And in general, I mean,"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"they're used to the fluoride in the water,"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"but I do think that big bottled water"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"certainly like leveraged it."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"There is also a taste issue."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"I mean, I think that depending on where you go,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"you use that hotel tap, you use that AM/PM tap."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"It doesn't necessarily taste good."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"And I think that that's not something you want from your,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"you really don't want taste from your water."
01:14:21;01:14:25;"- The water in Joshua tree tastes really bad."
01:14:25;01:14:27;"- And Jake, also as an experienced camper,"
01:14:27;01:14:30;"this is real that you can't willy nilly"
01:14:30;01:14:34;"go fill up your Nalgene in every Creek and river you come to."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"You're very likely to get Giardia."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Is that true?"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"- My understanding of it is that if the Creek"
01:14:41;01:14:45;"or river has like a nice current to it, you're fine."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"If I wouldn't fill up a water bottle"
01:14:46;01:14:50;"in like a really still pond or like a part in the river"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"where the waters run deep."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"They run deep."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"I've definitely in the Sierra Nevada"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"when I'm back packing trips I've done,"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"I've definitely filled up water bottles"
01:15:00;01:15:04;"in a healthily burbling Brook and been fine."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"I've never gotten Giardia."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- Maybe you throw in like iodine pills or something."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"- No, I don't."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"- You're talking about raw water."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"- It's raw water, it's snow melt."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"But yeah, if it was like,"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"if there was like an area that had been sort of backed up"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"and there was like a big pool"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"of like pretty still standing water,"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"I wouldn't drink out of that."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"- Have you ever just like knelt at a Creek"
01:15:23;01:15:27;"and just sip the water on all fours?"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"- Yes, I have."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"- New study just dropped."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"People who've gotten on all fours"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"and lapped up Creek water have a 0% chance of getting COVID."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"- Jake, just on all fours at the LA river."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"You're just driving."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"- I haven't done LA river."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"- I mean, Jake Longstreth, American painter,"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"TikToker, naturalist, maverick."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- Wow."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I would love to get to the bottom of this"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"because Sanfo, you said it's very interesting."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"Like, of course we know that there's this kind"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"of crime against humanity happening in a place"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"like Flint, Michigan,"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"where just this large population of people"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"being ignored by the government,"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"having something went totally wrong"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"with their infrastructure there."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"And there's bad water."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"And you think about how much we rely on water for everything."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"But then the question is,"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"is that like, you know, reporting some horrific crime,"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"you know, in a city of 10 million people"
01:16:19;01:16:22;"and making everybody like super paranoid,"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"even though the vast majority of people should be cautious,"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"but go about their lives in a healthy way."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"And is it ratcheting up the anxiety?"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"I really don't know."
01:16:31;01:16:32;"I mean, the numbers you're talking about,"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"nine to 45 million, that's a lot of Americans."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"It's still, if it's 9 million,"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"you are talking about less than 10%."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"And obviously that would really depend on where you are."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"So I guess, 'cause I get the impression"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"around a lot of people that I know"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"that they don't look at it like,"
01:16:49;01:16:50;"whenever I go to a new place,"
01:16:50;01:16:54;"I like to double check that I'm not in some sort of like red zone"
01:16:54;01:16:57;"where there's something horrible happening to the water."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"In fact, it's almost more like wherever I am,"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"I don't drink tap water."
01:17:00;01:17:03;"That's what happened to many people."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"I don't know if these are more like,"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"if these are more like upper middle class types"
01:17:07;01:17:11;"who want to buy the Fiji water to begin with."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"I don't know, but there's, but clearly something,"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"the anti-tap water machine won big, I think."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"- So Jake, if you come over to my house,"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"there's, you have the sink, the regular tap water,"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"and right next is a little filtered water tap."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- Sure."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"- Are you just going for the tap water?"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"- Oh, when you have the choice."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- No, I mean, I'll do the filtered."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"If someone's like, oh, that's the filter tap."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"I'm like, okay, I'll do that."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"- When Jake does that,"
01:17:38;01:17:42;"he gets his first cold in four years later that week."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"- I was recently in a hotel in Denver."
01:17:44;01:17:47;"I think I drank a little bit of tap water"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"'cause there was no more like bottled water in the room."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"There was a tiny bit of anxiety like put into me."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"That's like, oh, you don't know what you're dealing with."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"So let me get a number crunch."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"How's Denver tap water?"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"- Yeah, I'll crunch that."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"But I also have to speculate that Colorado,"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"what was natural mountains."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"- Beautiful mountains."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"- Yeah, snow melt exactly."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Feels like a more pure."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"- Yeah, should be."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"You'd think it'd be great."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"- While he number crunches,"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"Jake, you walk into my house,"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"it's 102 degrees outside."
01:18:15;01:18:17;"Hot all to the end of the day."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"You're so thirsty."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"You pass by a sink."
01:18:20;01:18:21;"It's just regular tap water."
01:18:21;01:18:22;"And I go, well, if you want the filtered,"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"it's in the other room."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"It's just a couple steps away."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"But are you like,"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"I'm just gonna drink out of the tap water."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"- Yeah, I'll do tap."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Just throw some ice cubes in there."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"- By the way, that's a whole other thing."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Drinking filtered water,"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"but your ice cubes."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- Are tap."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"I think that happens more often"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"than people want to admit."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- That is true."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"This is the original hygiene theater, folks."
01:18:43;01:18:49;"Disgusting, just busted ass, old Brita."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"- And the irony, obviously, being in,"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"and there's a lot of people online"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"that would agree with this,"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"that I found is that the irony being"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"is that that Brita is significantly worse"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"for you than the tap water."
01:19:00;01:19:01;"- Because of the plastic?"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"- Well, if you haven't cleaned the filter,"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"there's mold."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"There's just so many other things"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"that you don't even get out of the tap"
01:19:07;01:19:12;"that the irony being you're much better off."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"- Unintended consequences."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Right."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"I also wonder,"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"is it possible that everybody"
01:19:17;01:19:21;"putting their water through these plastic filters"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"increased some other kind of rates of disease"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"or problems?"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"Can't win."
01:19:28;01:19:31;"- Listen, you're in luck, Ezra."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"The snow melt is a big component"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"of Denver's drinking water."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"They've got pristine water"
01:19:37;01:19:40;"sourced from 100% surface water"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"that comes from river streams and reservoirs,"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"high quality mountain snow."
01:19:44;01:19:47;"2018, their water was tested by the EPA"
01:19:47;01:19:53;"and it had a very low PFAS content."
01:19:53;01:20:00;"Now PFAS is per and polyfluoroacryl substances."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"- PF Changs."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"- Right, PF Changs water."
01:20:03;01:20:06;"- A concentration of PF Changs ingredients."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"- So the group of chemicals, PFAS,"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"which is used to make carpet, clothing,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"furniture, and cookware,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"those were found at very, very low levels"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"in that Denver."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"- The dreaded microplastics, folks."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"- Sure."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"- Oh, God."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"- Of which we all have microplastics"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"coursing through our veins right now."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- Good Lord."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"Well, I'm happy to report"
01:20:27;01:20:32;"that so far this episode has been about pizza and water."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"- The basics."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"- Just the basics."
01:20:35;01:20:38;"- I was having this while, you know,"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"we were talking about it,"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"just thinking of that image of Jake in a pizza place"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"eating that sausage and olive"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"and just downing it with just a big,"
01:20:46;01:20:50;"one of those big plastic red cups of tap water."
01:20:50;01:20:55;"- Water out of the Coca-Cola fountain machine."
01:20:55;01:20:57;"- I've noticed in the recent years"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"that there's restaurants where they say,"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"""Oh, can I get you some water?"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"We have still sparkling or filtered tap."""
01:21:05;01:21:06;"That's become a thing,"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"because we got still and sparkling"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"if you want to buy the fancy bottle,"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"but we also have filtered tap."
01:21:11;01:21:14;"But I love the idea of Jake going like,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"""How about just regular tap?"""
01:21:16;01:21:17;"- Just straight tap."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"- Jesus Christ."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"- Unfiltered tap."
01:21:19;01:21:20;"- How about regular tap?"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"- I don't care if you have to go to the bathroom"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"to fill it up."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"- Yeah, you got a spigot?"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"Where's your spigot?"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"- We could do filtered tap, sir."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"All right, here's 20 bucks."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"Go around the back of the AM/PM across the street."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"(laughing)"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"- There's a spigot over by that dumpster."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"(laughing)"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"I'm fine with hose water"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"if you get anybody out back watering."
01:21:43;01:21:44;"- I mean, I feel like as a kid,"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"I was taking down a decent amount of hose water."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"- Oh, definitely."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"- It's a rite of passage."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"- Let's get a water scientist on the next episode"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"to really dig into this."

01:22:54;01:22:56;"in the music game a little bit."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"- That's right."
01:22:57;01:23:00;"- Now, was that the first Mountain Brews show ever"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"the other day?"
01:23:01;01:23:02;"- Yes."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"- Wow."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"- First Mountain Brews show ever."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- You guys sounded great."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"It was a great vibe."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- Thank you."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"I'm glad you made it."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"- Oh yeah, I was psyched."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"Now, interesting, first Mountain Brews show,"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"it was kind of at a backyard barbecue."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"- Yep, Memorial Day weekend."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"- A lot of kids running around."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"- Yeah, I think half the audience was children"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"under the age of five."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"(laughing)"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"- Checking out their first Brews show."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"- Yeah."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"- And actually, the sound was really good."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"I told you after the show, I was really impressed"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"by the little PA you had."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Did you bring that or that was like a--"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"- No, that was a friend of the show, Alex."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Alex Gordelis, that was his house."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"And his Neil Young cover band played and then--"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"- Cinnamon Boys."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"- And then he had this little PA that he said was"
01:23:46;01:23:50;"generally meant for corporate conferences."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"(laughing)"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"- But it really sounded good 'cause like, I don't know,"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"my memories are kind of like playing backyard shows"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"in the 90s, a lot of feedback,"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"just hard to get the levels right."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"It's like a very solid, good sounding PA."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"- Love to hear it."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"I remember asking the audience after multiple songs,"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"how's the mix?"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- It was a good mix."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"- And then we got our next show,"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Busy Summer for Mountain Brews,"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"and then we got our next show with Taper's Choice."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"- Oh, I've heard about this show."
01:24:18;01:24:23;"- June 18th in LA at the Spoke Bicycle Cafe"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"in Frogtown."
01:24:25;01:24:28;"- Are you gonna switch up the set list for that show?"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Because it was a tight set list."
01:24:30;01:24:35;"Interestingly, there's no Worst Margarita on the set list."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- Kind of slow."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Yeah."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- We don't have enough time."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"I think we're doing more or less the same set list."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Probably a different sequence."
01:24:43;01:24:46;"- You know what song really sounded great was Spring Wind."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"- Oh, really?"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"That sounded good to you?"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"- I thought it sounded really good."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"- Okay, cool."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"I thought that was really shaky."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"I'm glad to hear that."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"- No, I enjoyed it."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"I mean, it was just a cool moment in the set,"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"getting a little reggae."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"(laughing)"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- Well, the next show we're gonna have"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"Tim Ramsey on keyboards."
01:25:02;01:25:05;"We're gonna have a seven piece version of Mountain Brews."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"We're gonna have two keyboards."
01:25:07;01:25:11;"We'll have Casey Johansson singing on most of the songs"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"with us too."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"'Cause she sings like in Raised in a Place,"
01:25:14;01:25:17;"♪ So far away from here ♪"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"And she sings on Spring Wind."
01:25:19;01:25:23;"- I love the live intro to Raised in a Place."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"Each member of the band goes around,"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"says their name and where they were raised."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"(laughing)"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"- That was impromptu."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- That was impromptu?"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Really?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- Oh yeah."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- And then at the end, I think Jake,"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"you said like, I'm Jake from Connecticut."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"I was raised in Connecticut."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"And then you say like,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"we were all raised in a place or something."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"(laughing)"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"- Then just kick right in."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"- I wanna work out some like,"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"kinda dumb ass like Springsteen thing of just like,"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"you know, we used to go down to the pumpkin patch"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"every fall for the fall harvest."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"(laughing)"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"And when you went down there,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"and there was nothing but a big parking lot"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"(laughing)"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"with a Blockbuster video on one side"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"and a Starbucks on the other."
01:25:59;01:26:03;"Just like, like right in the middle of the song."
01:26:03;01:26:07;"Do some like overly long Raised in a Place monologue."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"♪ One day I went back to my local Taco Bell ♪"

01:26:27;01:26:29;"Anyway, I was just saying, you know,"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"the last show I played was Richard Pictures"
01:26:32;01:26:36;"at Hollywood Bowl opening for Vampire,"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"October of 2019."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"- That was the last show you did, period."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"- That was the last show I played,"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"a live rock show that I played."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"And then, yeah, the Mountain Brew show"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"at Alex's house was the first show I played"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"emerging out of the pandemic."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"- Whoa."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"- We got some Richard Pictures on the books"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"for this fall at the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Hopefully do a Mountain Brew's record release show"
01:26:57;01:27:00;"'cause we're gonna put out some vinyl in the fall."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- Oh yeah, that's exciting."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"- So things are cooking"
01:27:03;01:27:06;"in a very low key back burner way."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"Hobby rock sort of way."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"- Any new Mountain Brew's music to look forward to?"
01:27:10;01:27:13;"- Yeah, we were playing a new one called I'm Over It."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"We played that at the show."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"I haven't recorded."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"I mean, yeah, I don't know."
01:27:18;01:27:19;"I gotta find the time."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"But yeah, we'd love to record."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Maybe later in the year we will."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"What's going on with you?"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"- Well, been working on Vampire,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"as always, slowly but surely."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"- Great."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"- With some significant breaks."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"- We're in there."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"It's really getting there."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Some very strong material."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"- LP5."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"- We're doing some little shows here and there."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"I mean, our last big show was last year,"
01:27:41;01:27:45;"our one show of 2021, that SF Festival, Outside Lands."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"- Yeah."
01:27:46;01:27:49;"- We done a couple private gigs,"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"helping us get back in."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"And then, you know, coming up,"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"we got a bunch of fun new festivals."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"And back to, well, I guess when this airs,"
01:27:58;01:28:01;"in Indianapolis this weekend, last night."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"- A festival."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"- Yeah, a new festival."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"- Wow."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"- And then, you know, there's like a bunch this summer."
01:28:07;01:28:12;"This summer, we basically have five shows."
01:28:12;01:28:16;"Indianapolis, Cleveland, Gonzales, Texas."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Tight locations."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"- Japan, Korea."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"- Whoa."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"- That's the Vampire Weekend 22 tour."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Wouldn't have it any other way."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"So anyway, we got that going on."
01:28:26;01:28:29;"But one thing that I kind of forgot about,"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"'cause I played a very small role in this new"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"Liam Gallagher album."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"And actually, I don't know if I've heard"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"like the fully mixed and mastered song."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"- Insane."
01:28:39;01:28:43;"- But basically, a buddy of mine, Andrew Wyatt,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"great musician, he's got the band Mike Snow,"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"and he's also a very accomplished producer and songwriter."
01:28:48;01:28:51;"We were just like catching up, and he was like working on,"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"he's worked a lot with Liam."
01:28:53;01:28:57;"And I guess at this point, Liam's dropped a few solo albums."
01:28:57;01:29:00;"And he was working on his new one."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"He was like, ""Yeah, you know, we're just like,"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"""a bunch of different people are working on it."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"""If you have any song ideas, let me know."""
01:29:06;01:29:09;"And it's never been something I've been like passionate about,"
01:29:09;01:29:13;"like trying to write songs with or for other people."
01:29:13;01:29:16;"There have been a handful of times in my life, you know,"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"like that Beyonce song, like a demo I worked on"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"just kind of ends up somewhere."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"That's cool when it happens."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"But like generally speaking, I just feel like,"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"I don't know, I'm just always kind of like thinking about,"
01:29:28;01:29:31;"it's enough work just to think about like Vampire Weekend stuff."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"I don't know if on command, I can just like sit down"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"and write a song for somebody else."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"But you know, every once in a while an idea comes."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"So I just sat at the piano, and of course, like, you know,"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"Oasis rules, and he's such a legend."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"So I was like, ""Do I have any ideas?"""
01:29:43;01:29:44;"And at first I was like, ""No."""
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And then I sat down at the piano, and I started writing this"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"kind of like climbing chord progression."
01:29:49;01:29:54;"And I wrote this kind of like song with a significant"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"kind of Cold War aesthetic."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"And this was like a few years ago, so it has absolutely"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"nothing to do with the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"But I'd also recently learned this phrase,"
01:30:04;01:30:08;"that was a Cold War era phrase, ""Moscow rules,"""
01:30:08;01:30:14;"which is a series of rules that like undercover agents"
01:30:14;01:30:19;"working in the East Block during the Cold War would adhere to."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"So I'm like, ""You want to pull up the actual Moscow rules?"""
01:30:21;01:30:23;"It's basically on something like, ""You can't trust anyone."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"Always assume the opposition is watching,"" that kind of stuff."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"And I was struck by that phrase, ""Moscow rules."""
01:30:29;01:30:31;"So I was like, ""Oh, that's kind of like an interesting metaphor"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"for a song."""
01:30:33;01:30:35;"Anyway, I end up working on it, working on it with Liam,"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"becomes like a real song."
01:30:37;01:30:42;"It's a track on his album, which came out recently."
01:30:42;01:30:46;"My buddy Andrew told me it went to number one in the UK,"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"first UK number one I've ever been a part of."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Vampire Weekend clocked in at number two,"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"I believe, on our last album."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Never got the top slot."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"But yeah, it was fun working on it."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"I played some instruments."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"I randomly played some saxophone."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Vocals?"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"No vocals. I'm not a feature."
01:31:03;01:31:07;"I'm a co-producer and co-writer on this song."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Can I just read you the Moscow rules real fast?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Oh, the actual Moscow rules? Yeah, please."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"Yeah."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"""Assume nothing. Never go against your gut."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"Everyone is potentially under opposition control."
01:31:18;01:31:21;"Do not look back. You are never completely alone."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Go with the flow. Blend in."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Vary your pattern and stay within your cover."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Lull them into a sense of complacency."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Do not harass the opposition."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"Pick the time and place for action."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"Keep your options open."""
01:31:34;01:31:38;"That's just solid advice in any moment in time."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"""Never go against your gut"" is a good one."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Anyway, let's throw it on."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"I want to play this for you guys."

01:33:35;01:33:39;"I think you're never alone."
01:33:39;01:33:55;"Even if I'm the empty seat across the table, staring back."""
01:33:55;01:33:56;"Interesting."
01:34:01;01:34:07;"This was kind of like the David Axelrod '60s film score break."
01:34:07;01:34:29;"I think that's Liam added that snare."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Yeah, the drumming is cool in this song."
01:34:31;01:34:49;"It's not because it's Liam, but this is like much more Beatles-y than Vampire would ever get."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"Hmm."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"Yeah, that's true."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"""Moscow Rules, lonely man."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"I think you're never alone."
01:34:57;01:35:09;"Even if I'm the empty seat across the table, staring back."""
01:35:09;01:35:12;"That piano melody I thought was very Cold War."
01:35:12;01:35:19;"That has real Revolver energy to me."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"I could see that."
01:35:20;01:35:25;"And it's also a little bit like-- the verse is kind of kinksy, I thought."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Like a little bit English folk music."
01:35:27;01:35:33;"""I'm overcovered, and when it's dead, it doesn't even die."""
01:35:33;01:35:35;"Yeah, I love his voice."
01:35:35;01:35:40;"And he had a lot of cool ideas, and it was fun co-writing it with him and Andrew."
01:35:40;01:35:44;"But there's a few of the lines that I wrote, I just had a feeling would sound cool with"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"him singing it on the chorus."
01:35:47;01:35:51;"It's such a classic rock thing to go, ""Follows me, follows you."
01:35:51;01:35:54;"It's the same, Moscow Rules."""
01:35:54;01:35:56;"And I knew that he would kill this part."
01:35:56;01:36:01;"""Lonely man, I think you're never alone."""
01:36:01;01:36:05;"I just love that line, and I couldn't wait to hear him sing."
01:36:05;01:36:09;"""Lonely man, I think you're never alone."""
01:36:09;01:36:10;"Wow."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"And he's also just such a cool dude."
01:36:12;01:36:16;"He really is exactly what you'd want him to be."
01:36:16;01:36:18;"How much time did you spend together?"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"You know, a couple hours here, a couple hours there."
01:36:21;01:36:26;"Not like a ton, but enough to just chat and hang out."
01:36:26;01:36:31;"He's just so naturally funny and kind of charming."
01:36:31;01:36:35;"Like exactly what you see in an interview."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"I guess it's true of his brother too."
01:36:37;01:36:42;"They both just have this way with words."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"I guess it's a very English thing."
01:36:44;01:36:48;"You know when you just meet somebody, everything they say, they just got a way with words."
01:36:48;01:36:53;"Even just making small talk, and I don't know if this is something he says all the time,"
01:36:53;01:36:56;"but still, I was just so charmed and struck by him."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"I just thought he was so funny and cool."
01:36:58;01:37:02;"At one point, we were in a studio in London."
01:37:02;01:37:06;"Obviously you're from Manchester, but you live in London."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"I was like, ""Yeah, yeah, I live in London."""
01:37:08;01:37:10;"I was like, ""How long have you been down here?"""
01:37:10;01:37:13;"And he was like, ""Oh, man, you know, long time."""
01:37:13;01:37:16;"Sorry, I'm going to do a really bad accent, but I can't do it in an American accent."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"And he just starts talking about, ""Move down here to London."""
01:37:19;01:37:22;"""God, all the buildings, so f*cking bright."
01:37:22;01:37:26;"Why I had to wear my sunglasses just to nip down to the grocery store?"""
01:37:26;01:37:29;"Or whatever, just like these little things like that."
01:37:29;01:37:33;"Just like the buildings are so white, I had to put on my f*cking sunglasses."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Just like all these funny little things."
01:37:35;01:37:38;"Every story he told was just so funny."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Anyway, that was pretty tight."
01:37:40;01:37:45;"The other week, it was my first travel in a very long time since pre-COVID."
01:37:45;01:37:51;"And I was flying in the flight attendant, who, story for another time,"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"called himself the Keith Richards of flight attendants."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"[laughter]"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"He really loved this guy."
01:37:59;01:38:03;"I mean, he really made this flight just so entertaining."
01:38:03;01:38:07;"But he was telling me, we were flying from London,"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"and it's sort of a regular route of his, and he spends a lot of time there."
01:38:10;01:38:13;"I don't know, it's not even that long ago, maybe six years ago or so."
01:38:13;01:38:18;"He was in sort of a local pub outside of London."
01:38:18;01:38:22;"And he was just having a pint, and he was talking to some dude"
01:38:22;01:38:26;"who started chatting him up about the weather and just some bullsh*t."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"And him just being really funny and charming."
01:38:28;01:38:31;"And then he was like, ""I gotta get up and go,"" and he gets up to leave."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"""Oh sh*t, I'm needed somewhere."""
01:38:33;01:38:37;"He says to the bartender, the Keith Richards of flight attendants, goes,"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"""Man, that guy looks so much like Liam Gallagher."""
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And the bartender goes, ""It is."""
01:38:42;01:38:45;"And he turns around, and he just gets right into a Bentley"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"outside this place and takes off."
01:38:47;01:38:48;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:38:48;01:38:53;"And so he's just hanging out at a really neighborhood place,"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"having himself a pint, talking to strangers."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"-And this is-- -Love that."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"I know, it's very much every story you hear about him."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Just absolutely the character you want him to be."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"I love that."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"You know, I also have this memory, when we were--"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"because we were talking about all the references for the songs"
01:39:10;01:39:14;"and what he thought was cool, and I was referencing the kinks a little bit."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"And I was like, I think maybe I asked him,"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"""Have you ever crossed paths with those guys?"""
01:39:18;01:39:19;"He's like, ""Yeah, all the f*cking time."""
01:39:19;01:39:22;"And there's this funny parallel, because there's these two famous"
01:39:22;01:39:25;"English bands with brothers who famously fight."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"He just said something funny, he's like--"
01:39:27;01:39:30;"And you could tell he's a huge fan, but it's something about being at the pub."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"And he's like, ""I always see Ray Davies, he always asks me, 'How's my brother?'"""
01:39:33;01:39:35;"And I say, ""How's your f*cking brother?"""
01:39:35;01:39:37;"And I was just like, you could totally picture it."
01:39:37;01:39:41;"Like, for whatever reason, it's like, I don't know,"
01:39:41;01:39:44;"the American music scene, maybe because it's a big country,"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"it's not down to earth enough, but I could totally picture this."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"A London pub, Ray Davies in there drinking by himself,"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Liam walks in for a thing,"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"I have this funny exchange, ""How's your brother?"""
01:39:54;01:39:55;"""How's your f*cking brother?"""
01:39:55;01:39:57;"It actually feels real."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Him pulling up in the Bentley hat."
01:39:59;01:40:02;"I guess, like, yeah, who in the US would do that?"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"It just wouldn't be quite the same."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"Like, it's just so English."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"I think one issue that maybe is bigger than anything,"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"in terms of how people act, is just,"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"America doesn't have pubs."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"We don't have quite that combination of,"
01:40:15;01:40:18;"we have dive bars, we have noisy sports bars,"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"we don't have that slight, it's like,"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"because a pub could have a touch of dive bar,"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"but also a touch of cozy living room."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"It's like a unique..."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"Family restaurant."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"Yeah, it's like a family restaurant meets a living room,"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"meets a dive bar."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"America really could use some pubs."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"They really could, man."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Introducing the TC Pub."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"Yeah."
01:40:39;01:40:42;"The first TC Pub is opening in Cleveland,"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"summer '22."
01:40:44;01:40:48;"Yeah, it sort of hits different to say,"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"""Yeah, I saw Steve Malcomus"
01:40:51;01:40:54;"at this, like, f*cking dive bar in the valley."""
01:40:54;01:40:57;"You'd be like, ""Damn, is he okay?"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"What happened to him?"""
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Yeah."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Oh, God."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"Yeah, not quite the same."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"I mean, I'm sure there's an English person listening,"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"being like, ""You got it totally wrong."""
01:41:05;01:41:08;"But of course, we're looking at it from a different perspective,"
01:41:08;01:41:11;"and it always struck me as being so..."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"I always like pubs when I'm in the UK"
01:41:13;01:41:16;"just because they're quiet and cozy."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"They got carpet."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"I don't know."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Yeah, and they have a carpet."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"Basically, America just needs more car..."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"Is that what it's all about, actually?"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"Carpeted bars."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Carpeted bars."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"The new album from Guided by Voices."
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Okay, well, anyway,"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"shout-out to Liam Gallagher."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"Very happy to be part of your album."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Sounds good, bud."
01:41:37;01:41:40;"Yeah, that was a fun song to work on."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"All right, you ready for the top five?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Yes, sir."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Too bad."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"Oh."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"In lieu of the top five, we're going to do the top one"
01:41:47;01:41:50;"because something very interesting has happened."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Kate Bush, very recently,"
01:41:52;01:41:55;"was number one in the iTunes store."
01:41:55;01:41:58;"And some people say the iTunes store doesn't matter that much."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"They want to know about streaming."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Well, guess what?"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"She's crushing it on streaming."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"And some people only think it's official"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"if you're talking about Billboard."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"Well, guess what?"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"She's in the Billboard top ten."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"So I think this deserves its own segment."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"For anybody who's been living under a rock,"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"the reason Kate Bush is back"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"is because her classic '80s song,"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"""Runnin' Up That Hill,"""
01:42:18;01:42:21;"was in the new season of Stranger Things,"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"and it's really taken off,"
01:42:23;01:42:26;"and it's kind of literally becoming a hit song again."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Amazing."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"We haven't talked about Kate Bush that much on the show."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Jake, I'm curious."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"What's your relationship with Kate Bush like?"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"I'm a fan."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"I don't know it in a deep sense."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"I know that record."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Hounds of Love?"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Hounds of Love."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"I was going to say, is it Cloudbusting?"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"No, Hounds of Love."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"Cloudbusting is the song on that album."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Yeah, and I know the one before that, too."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"It's been-- I'm a little rusty, I've got to say,"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"but in my life, I've spent a lot of time with her music,"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"but it's been years."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"Well, her first big hit ever in the UK"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"was ""Wuthering Heights."""
01:42:56;01:42:57;"That was a number one."
01:42:57;01:42:59;"That's what I'm thinking of."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"A debut number one single, and that's--"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"Yes."
01:43:02;01:43:04;"I'm sure like many people, that got me into Kate Bush."
01:43:04;01:43:08;"Like many Americans, I had never heard that song casually."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"I guess in the UK, it's a classic."
01:43:10;01:43:15;"That was like a number one hit when she was maybe like 16 or something."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"What?"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"And her story is cool."
01:43:17;01:43:20;"She was like semi-discovered by David Gilmour from Pink Floyd."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Oh, I didn't know any of this. Wow."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Worth noting that she produced--"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"after a certain point, she produced all her own stuff,"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"including ""Running Up That Hill."""
01:43:29;01:43:31;"So when you think about it that way, Kate Bush is also--"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"Woo, woo, woo."
01:43:32;01:43:35;"--a very influential and sick producer,"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"in addition to being a great singer and songwriter."
01:43:37;01:43:40;"But I knew very little about Kate Bush"
01:43:40;01:43:44;"until I think I was like 16 or 17,"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"and I was just getting--"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"I was just like obsessed with music,"
01:43:49;01:43:52;"and I'd always be psyched to get my hands on like"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"an English music magazine,"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"just because the way they wrote about music"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"was a little bit different."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"You know, a picture like the late--"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"Yeah."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"--like '99, 2000, somebody handed me a copy of Q."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"I was really fascinated by it."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"Anyway, at some point, there was some list of songs,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"and of course there's a ton of crossover"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"with what American critics at the time"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"considered classic music in the UK."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"It was some list, and it said something about Kate Bush, ""Wuthering Heights,"""
01:44:16;01:44:19;"and I'd read the book ""Wuthering Heights"" and enjoyed it,"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"and I was like, ""What is this [bleep]?"""
01:44:21;01:44:22;"""Kate Bush sounds familiar."""
01:44:22;01:44:24;"""What-- there's a song called 'Wuthering Heights'?"""
01:44:24;01:44:26;"And they're like, ""Oh, this was the number one single?"""
01:44:26;01:44:28;"It all sounded so weird and exotic."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"And I think on--"
01:44:29;01:44:32;"maybe on some like early Soul Seek or something,"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"I like downloaded ""Wuthering Heights,"""
01:44:33;01:44:35;"and I was like, ""This [bleep] is crazy."""
01:44:35;01:44:36;"It really is."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"I still love that song."
01:44:37;01:44:38;"Wait, should we listen to that real fast?"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"Yeah, yeah, we could do a little Kate Bush rundown."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"I haven't heard that song in so long."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"I'm very excited to hear it."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"[piano music]"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"So what year is this, by the way?"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"I think like '78."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Did I get a number crunch, Seinfeld?"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"'77."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Wow, right as punk is blowing up."
01:44:55;01:44:59;"[piano music]"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"But I think-- yeah, it's so funny, this music."

01:55:21;01:55:30;"I bet in the US, it was probably on some college radio station, late night alternative type s***."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"Because she just wasn't a pop star here."

01:56:59;01:57:01;"Weird synth line."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"[singing]"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"[imitates synth]"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"[singing]"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"Well, it's so weird too."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"You're talking about indie rock from 15 years ago."
01:57:47;01:57:51;"This place that we're in with aesthetics, this doesn't sound old."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"Yeah. It only marginally."
01:57:53;01:57:56;"It has a little bit of a tape sound."
01:57:56;01:57:59;"But other than that, yeah, aesthetically."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"[singing]"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"It's just hard to picture."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"I mean, yeah, I don't want to be a hater."
01:58:14;01:58:22;"Are there big hits, not counting this song, in this era that are just quite this weird and poetic?"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"I'll make some Smith stuff."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"I don't know."
01:58:25;01:58:28;"No, but I mean in our era, big pop songs."
01:58:28;01:58:32;"Stuff we'd hear in the top five, like Morgan Wallen."
01:58:32;01:58:35;"Where's Morgan Wallen's running up that hill?"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure there's something."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"Of course, there's always people."
01:58:39;01:58:45;"I'm just saying it's quite a unique moment when this would be number one in the UK."
01:58:45;01:58:49;"Yeah, I mean, I could hear this right next to later period Weekend."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"Yeah, Weekend probably likes Kate Bush."
01:58:51;01:58:59;"Well, it's so funny because we've heard a lot of '80s influenced Harry Styles and Weekend on the top five the last year or two."
01:58:59;01:59:04;"And then it's funny that this was on Stranger Things and kind of punches through the noise."
01:59:04;01:59:07;"And it's sort of like, let's just get back to the original."
01:59:07;01:59:10;"Right, cut out the middle, man."
01:59:10;01:59:19;"I mean, and the dope thing about Kate Bush is like, I guess you could say that this is true of many of the greatest of all time figures."
01:59:19;01:59:24;"She makes something close enough to pop music that she had many hits in her day."
01:59:24;01:59:34;"But she's thinking about and reading stuff as esoteric and weird as any like weirdo noise artist."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:35;01:59:44;"That's what you want. Like those truly are like the goats, the Kate Bushes, the David Bowies, like even like the Kanye's or something."
01:59:44;01:59:50;"People who like are they have this knack for kind of songwriting and pop form."
01:59:50;01:59:58;"And yet they arguably are as weird, if not weirder than anybody you would meet in any kind of like underground scene."
01:59:58;02:00:01;"You know, they're that idiosyncratic. Like it's the best combination."
02:00:01;02:00:04;"All the best people have some version of that."
02:00:04;02:00:05;"Well, we could talk about Kate Bush forever."
02:00:05;02:00:10;"I just want to end on one more Kate Bush song because I didn't know this song until actually pretty recently."
02:00:10;02:00:13;"And this is some cool like later Kate Bush."
02:00:13;02:00:16;"Well, not later because this is the last album before her hiatus."
02:00:16;02:00:21;"And there is cool stuff on like the 2000s era stuff."
02:00:21;02:00:26;"But this is the last album of her kind of like original run from 78 to 93."
02:00:26;02:00:28;"This album is called The Red Shoes."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"Can you throw on the song You're the One?"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"Because it's just like a different side of Kate Bush."
02:00:32;02:00:34;"This is her doing kind of like a Prince thing."
02:00:34;02:00:46;"My friend played this for me last year."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"Wow, 93."
02:00:48;02:00:49;"Yeah."
02:00:49;02:00:54;"It's alright too. It's just everything I do."
02:00:54;02:00:59;"We did together."
02:00:59;02:01:03;"And there's a little piece of you."
02:01:03;02:01:07;"And whatever."
02:01:07;02:01:10;"I got everything I need."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"I got petrol in the car."
02:01:12;02:01:15;"I got some money with me."
02:01:15;02:01:18;"There's just one problem."
02:01:19;02:01:23;"I love this."
02:01:23;02:01:25;"She's not doing like the mystical thing."
02:01:25;02:01:28;"It's kind of like a regular breakup song."
02:01:28;02:01:32;"You're the only one I want."
02:01:32;02:01:41;"You're the only one I want."
02:01:55;02:01:59;"You're the only one I want."
02:01:59;02:02:03;"A song like this could come out today and it would be sick."
02:02:03;02:02:04;"Oh, totally."
02:02:04;02:02:07;"Imagine this is like a new Frank Ocean song."
02:02:07;02:02:10;"So sick."
02:02:10;02:02:16;"I'm going to stay with my friend."
02:02:16;02:02:22;"Alright, well that's it for Time Crisis."
02:02:22;02:02:25;"Go listen to some Kate Bush."
02:02:25;02:02:28;"See you guys in two weeks. Peace."
02:02:28;02:02:31;"He's not you."
02:02:31;02:02:36;"He can't do what you do."
02:02:36;02:02:45;"He can't make me laugh and cry at the same time."
02:02:45;02:02:47;"Let's change things."
02:02:47;02:02:49;"Let's danger it up."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"We're crazy enough."
02:02:51;02:02:54;"I just come taking..."
02:02:54;02:02:58;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
