00:00;00:08;"Are you a northern redneck? Perhaps. Do you like country stuff? We'll find out."
00:08;00:14;"On this episode of Time Crisis we talk about the 4th of July, Aaron Lewis,"
00:14;00:33;"Stained, BTS, and new music from Walker Hayes. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:11;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up Jake? Not much, it's bright and early. We're"
01:20;01:24;"doing this one early. I'm an undisclosed different time zone."
01:24;01:29;"But, well, okay. I guess if I said what I was gonna say would disclose where you"
01:29;01:34;"are. I'll just say this, it's early for us, it's not early for you. It's TC time"
01:34;01:42;"for you. I'm in Mountain Time. You're one hour ahead. I'm one hour ahead. I'm in the"
01:42;01:48;"MT. Which is the coolest time zone as discussed. The greatest time zone. Jake,"
01:48;01:53;"how was your 4th of July? Pretty good, pretty uneventful to be honest. Let's see,"
01:53;01:57;"what did I even do? Yeah, we're way past 4th of July. We're actually closer now to"
01:57;02:02;"Bastille Day. I don't know if you guys celebrate that. What is that again? Wait,"
02:02;02:06;"Seinfeld, do you celebrate Bastille Day given that you come from a Francophone"
02:06;02:12;"land? I do not celebrate Bastille Day. I was just looking it up actually. I also"
02:12;02:17;"don't know a lot about it to be honest with you. Nick, not a Bastille Day guy?"
02:17;02:26;"Not in my house. Are you a Bastille Day guy? It begs the question. You know, it's"
02:26;02:32;"We're off to a rip-roaring start here guys. We are hot out of the gates today. It's kind of"
02:32;02:35;"weird when we're not in the same times and I'm bringing that mountain energy."
02:35;02:41;"Right. You guys are on that Pacific. Well, you know sometimes there's like a"
02:41;02:45;"fact that you really don't know that much about but you just like remember it."
02:45;02:49;"It's a little bit in the same zone as knowing that the first podcast was a"
02:49;02:54;"Grateful Dead song. You know, you come out hot with that and people are like, wow,"
02:54;02:58;"this guy knows some facts and then they sinks in. They say, well, what does that"
02:58;03:03;"mean? You say, I don't really know but it's true. I know that July 14th is"
03:03;03:08;"Bastille Day. Sometime in my childhood or school or something, I just"
03:08;03:13;"remember that because it has something to do with the French Revolution. The"
03:13;03:18;"Bastille was stormed. Whatever the Bastille was, they stormed it and I just"
03:18;03:23;"think I remembered, okay, so that's like a big Independence Day-esque celebration"
03:23;03:29;"in France and it's 10 days after the 4th of July. So, I always remember that July"
03:29;03:34;"14th is Bastille Day and I think, Seinfeld, do they have fireworks on"
03:34;03:39;"Bastille Day? Well, I'm on the Wikipedia page and there the main image is the"
03:39;03:44;"Eiffel Tower with fireworks all around it. So, there you have it folks. These are"
03:44;03:50;"two of the major July fireworks based holidays in the Western world. If you're"
03:50;03:56;"a fireworks head, you could like party on July 4th in the States somewhere and"
03:56;04:01;"then go to France. Ooh. Catch that show at the Eiffel on the 14th. I'm sure there"
04:01;04:07;"actually are like wealthy fireworks heads. People who are into like city"
04:07;04:13;"sanctioned firework shows. Well, and also they have to be Independence themed. Like"
04:13;04:16;"somebody's just talking like, ""Oh, do you ever go down at Disney World? They really"
04:16;04:19;"have a hell of a firework show every night."" And it's like, no, it's got no heart."
04:19;04:25;"It has to actually reference some type of political violence. That's the reason"
04:25;04:30;"why we set off the fireworks. Full disclosure, I'm a fireworks head that I'm"
04:30;04:36;"actually in France. I came out here for Bastille Day. I caught as"
04:36;04:41;"many shows as I could in the Los Angeles area for the 4th. Then I drove"
04:41;04:45;"cross-country and got on the fast boat to France."

06:09;06:11;"Okay, but Jake, back to this 4th of July."
06:11;06:12;"Yeah."
06:12;06:16;"Oh wait, you know what? I think the last episode was basically on- did it air on the 4th of July?"
06:16;06:18;"Oh yeah, it was a Sunday."
06:18;06:22;"We really sh*t the bed on that one. Zero reference."
06:22;06:22;"Oh yeah."
06:22;06:25;"The last episode had zero reference to the 4th of July."
06:25;06:28;"Okay, so did you get up to anything? Grilling?"
06:28;06:34;"Yeah, now I'm remembering. We took Lizzie to our friend Morgan's house."
06:34;06:34;"Uh-huh. I heard about this."
06:34;06:38;"He was barbecuing, and there was like a ton of kids there."
06:38;06:45;"Like all of a sudden, as soon as we've had a daughter, like you just gravitate towards the people that also have kids."
06:45;06:51;"And then she usually gets really cranky and wants to go to sleep at 6.30."
06:51;06:56;"So it's like you go there at 4, and at 6 o'clock she had a major meltdown."
06:56;06:57;"So we bailed."
06:57;06:59;"Oh, you didn't make it to the fireworks."
06:59;07:04;"Oh no. But you know what? I don't care about fireworks. I don't like them. They're boring."
07:04;07:05;"You're straight up anti-fireworks?"
07:05;07:10;"I'm anti. So then we got home, put her to bed, and then we were watching-"
07:10;07:14;"Speaking of France, we were watching some episodes of the show The Bureau."
07:14;07:18;"There were fireworks going on outside in our neighborhood. There's a ton of them always."
07:18;07:25;"We walked outside in the middle of them, you know, when it was dark at 8 or 9 o'clock, and watched them for like 15 seconds."
07:25;07:28;"And then we were both like, ""Okay, I'm good."""
07:28;07:32;"Very kind of Larry David, kind of like, ""Yeah, eh. They're boring."""
07:32;07:36;"I feel like if you're right underneath fireworks, they can be kind of exciting."
07:36;07:43;"My memories of driving to a football field or something as a kid and really feeling underneath it."
07:43;07:44;"Yeah, when you're a kid."
07:44;07:45;"Kind of exciting."
07:45;07:46;"Yeah."
07:46;07:49;"All right, so nothing particularly patriotic."
07:49;07:58;"I'm just a jaded, tired adult. I don't have room in my heart for sincere excitement around fireworks."
07:58;08:02;"Well, you sound like almost the polar opposite of Aaron Lewis."
08:02;08:04;"(laughs)"
08:04;08:09;"That is true. It seems like the 4th is his favorite holiday. Did that song come out on the 4th?"
08:09;08:16;"Well, this is... Okay, it came out on the 2nd. So, that was my rough transition into something I wanted to talk about."
08:16;08:25;"Because even though at some point on this show, we moved the top 5 from the top 5 songs on iTunes to the top 5 songs on Apple Music."
08:25;08:33;"And it made sense at the time. I'm starting to wonder if it's a mistake because there's a lot of weird energy still hanging out on iTunes."
08:33;08:36;"What's the difference? Is iTunes just a store where you buy stuff?"
08:36;08:40;"iTunes is like the old school MP3 store."
08:40;08:40;"Right."
08:40;08:43;"Which clearly some people still use."
08:43;08:43;"Right."
08:43;08:50;"That might have been one of the dominant forms of digital music consumption 10, 15 years ago."
08:50;08:57;"But, you know, these days, the average person, they're streaming it. They're streaming it on Apple Music."
08:57;08:59;"You don't need that physical release."
08:59;09:00;"(laughs)"
09:00;09:03;"Don't always need the physical release, depending on what it is."
09:03;09:09;"But sometimes you want a middle ground between the physical release and just streaming it once."
09:09;09:14;"So, I still look at the iTunes store and I just know - I looked over there and I was like,"
09:14;09:18;"""This is a different universe than a lot of what we're getting on the top 5 Apple Music."""
09:18;09:22;"I mean, probably a smaller group of people, different audience."
09:22;09:25;"But I saw this song was up there at number 1."
09:25;09:27;"And I saw the name was Aaron Lewis."
09:27;09:31;"And at first, I'm thinking, ""Is that the guy from Stained?"""
09:31;09:36;"It's like ringing a vague, a soft bell in my head."
09:36;09:43;"And I see the song as I'm the only one and some kind of American flag on the cover of the single."
09:43;09:45;"So, I was like, ""What is this?"""
09:45;09:50;"And then I checked the song out and I said, ""Okay, this is basically a conservative country song"
09:50;09:54;"from the guy from Stained who looms large."""
09:54;09:56;"And I don't think we've talked about enough on the show."
09:56;09:59;"I'm sure at some point we've talked about the huge Stained hit."
09:59;10:01;"""It's been a while."""
10:01;10:04;"One of the most legendary lines of the past 30 years."
10:04;10:07;"Infrequently sung in conversation."
10:07;10:10;"Like if you haven't seen someone in a while,"
10:10;10:12;"""Hey man, haven't seen you in a minute."""
10:12;10:14;"And the other guy goes, ""Been a while."""
10:14;10:16;"Exactly."
10:16;10:17;"I've definitely done that."
10:17;10:19;"Yeah, I definitely associate that with you."
10:19;10:23;"And it's also like for rock guys like us, of course, we know it."
10:23;10:27;"But a lot of people, even if they were around back then,"
10:27;10:30;"they may not be totally familiar with that song."
10:30;10:35;"And I find it hard if I hear the phrase, if somebody just says, ""Oh, it's been a while."""
10:35;10:37;"To not go, ""It's been a while."""
10:37;10:39;"But every once in a while, you'll just get somebody to be like,"
10:39;10:42;"""Just picture you don't actually know what that song is."""
10:42;10:48;"Like, it's very possible like Rashida has no idea what that song is."
10:48;10:51;"You know, just like, ""Oh yeah, I'd love to do that. It's been a while."""
10:51;10:53;"I'm just like, ""It's been a while."""
10:53;10:56;"What? Hit him with a zero context, ""It's been a while."""
10:56;11:00;"It's like your own version of Tourette's or something."
11:00;11:02;"You can't help it."
11:02;11:04;"I can't stop quoting Stained."
11:04;11:07;"Just like in the most inappropriate moments."
11:07;11:10;"True life. I can't quit."
11:10;11:13;"I can't stop singing Stained."
11:13;11:18;"In class, professors just like, ""It's great to finally not be on Zoom anymore, guys."
11:18;11:20;"It's nice to see all you. It's been a while."""
11:20;11:24;"I'm just like back at the lecture hall, ""It's been a while!"""
11:24;11:26;"Excuse me?"
11:26;11:31;"Just like sitting on a park bench by yourself"
11:31;11:34;"and you can kind of hear what the people across the way are talking about"
11:34;11:37;"and you hear one of them use the phrase, ""It's been a while!"""
11:37;11:39;"You're like, ""Oh my God, were you listening to us?"""
11:39;11:41;"""Not really. I just heard that phrase."""
11:41;11:44;"""Oh, why did you say it that way?"""
11:44;11:47;"""Jesus Christ, get away from us, officer."""
11:47;11:51;"I have a medical compulsion to sing that if I hear that phrase."
11:51;11:54;"That'd be a really hardcore Mandela effect too."
11:54;11:58;"I'm sure most TC heads are familiar with the concept of the Mandela effect."
11:58;12:02;"A lot of people have these memories, often associated with pop culture,"
12:02;12:05;"that the historical record doesn't back up."
12:05;12:11;"So there's many people out there who swore that Nelson Mandela died in prison."
12:11;12:16;"Whereas the historical record tells us that Nelson Mandela was freed from prison"
12:16;12:19;"and became the president of South Africa."
12:19;12:21;"So they call it the Mandela effect."
12:21;12:24;"A lot of people get together and say, ""I remember it that way too."""
12:24;12:28;"""What's up with that? Maybe we've got some kind of multiverse thing happening."""
12:28;12:32;"But I'm imagining one where millions of people around the world"
12:32;12:37;"remember a song from the late '90s, early 2000s called ""It's Been A While"""
12:37;12:39;"and every time they hear the phrase, they go, ""It's been a while."""
12:39;12:44;"But the historical record shows no evidence that there was ever a song called ""It's Been A While"""
12:44;12:46;"or that there was ever a band called ""Stained."""
12:46;12:50;"Somehow, tens of millions of people around the world have this shared memory."
12:50;12:52;"That would be the Mandela effect version."
12:52;12:55;"Yeah, or there would be a real glitch in the multiverse."
12:55;12:58;"That's my pitch for a Black Mirror episode."
12:58;13:00;"It's just like, ""Thanks for your submission."""
13:00;13:03;"I don't think you totally understand what Black Mirror is about."
13:03;13:05;"It's usually about technology."
13:05;13:08;"It'd be like, ""Music is a technology, sir."""
13:08;13:12;"""Mr. Brooker, music is a technology."""
13:12;13:15;"It'd be like a weirdo version of that movie ""Yesterday."""
13:15;13:16;"Yeah."
13:16;13:21;"Where the whole world has forgotten the Beatles catalog except for one dude."
13:21;13:27;"But this is a reverse where somehow the whole world starts going, ""It's been a while."""
13:27;13:33;"There's only one dude who doesn't remember the ""Stained"" song and he's very confused."
13:33;13:34;"Yeah."
13:34;13:37;"I like the idea of going to the creators of Black Mirror"
13:37;13:41;"and pitching them a lot of time crisis weirdo ideas."
13:41;13:43;"Yeah, ""Juice Island."""
13:45;13:50;"Didn't we have a whole thing once that was like, ""Members of One Direction."""
13:50;13:51;"It was like a movie."
13:51;13:55;"""Members of One Direction were working on Nantucket or something."""
13:55;13:56;"Yeah."
13:56;13:58;"Can I get a number crunch?"
13:58;14:00;"That sounds very familiar, but yeah."
14:00;14:02;"Let me crunch some numbers here."
14:02;14:07;"Just rolling up super serious for a big pitch meeting for Black Mirror."
14:07;14:11;"And they're just like, ""All right, guys. What you got?"""
14:11;14:14;"And we just start hitting them with ""Juice Island."""
14:14;14:17;"Just the most boneheaded DC stuff."
14:17;14:22;"And he's like, ""Guys, you really don't understand what Black Mirror is about."""
14:22;14:26;"And we're like, ""We get it, man. It's about a kind of alternate reality."
14:26;14:30;"It's about technology. Music is a technology."
14:30;14:32;"And it's about something that's not quite right."""
14:32;14:35;"""Oh, yeah. We get it, man. We put a lot of thought into these ideas."""
14:35;14:40;"He's like, ""That's not okay, but no, it's got to be about computers or some sh*t."""
14:40;14:43;"""No, man. We thought about that. No, no, no. We're one step ahead of you."""
14:43;14:45;"""Guacamole technology."""
14:45;14:47;"[Laughter]"
14:47;14:49;"We should make our own Black Mirror."
14:49;14:52;"Okay. Our own Black Mirror is called Green Mirror."
14:52;14:56;"And it's all kind of horror stories involving guacamole technology."
14:56;14:57;"How about that?"
14:57;14:58;"There we go."
14:58;15:03;"Niall Horan from One Direction's attempt to capture the tones of the early '80s Don Henley"
15:03;15:06;"sparks a fantasy movie called New Directions"
15:06;15:10;"about a recently widowed Jake running a hardware store in Nantucket."
15:10;15:16;"He finds true camaraderie with the '70s palette-obsessed former Direction members of One Direction."
15:16;15:17;"Wow."
15:17;15:22;"Leaves his chain-smokers-listening daughter in charge of the store while he goes on a world tour with the lads."
15:22;15:25;"[Laughter]"
15:25;15:26;"Charlie Brooker."
15:26;15:29;"Charlie Brooker, what do you think, man?"
15:29;15:30;"[Laughter]"
15:30;15:32;"Okay, guys."
15:32;15:35;"Have you ever seen an episode of Black Mirror?"
15:35;15:37;"Yes, sir. Absolutely."
15:37;15:41;"Black Mirror, they did that whole movie that took place in the '80s."
15:41;15:45;"What was that called about the video game developers?"
15:45;15:47;"Bandersnatch."
15:47;15:48;"Bandersnatch."
15:48;15:51;"Mr. Brooker, we know you got a soft spot for the 1980s,"
15:51;15:53;"and so we really cooked something up,"
15:53;15:56;"and we're going to dip a little bit into the tasteful palette of the '70s, too."
16:51;16:55;"Okay, maybe it's not—we just got to start our own show, Green Mirror."
16:55;17:00;"It's mostly stories about kind of what-ifs about musicians."
17:00;17:04;"Wait, Green Mirror isn't mostly about guacamole technology?"
17:04;17:08;"The first episode was about guacamole technology gone wrong,"
17:08;17:14;"and then the rest of them just tend to be about what if Don Henley went solo a few years earlier."
17:14;17:16;"A little more oddball."
17:16;17:17;"Yeah."
17:17;17:18;"It's on right after Gentle—"
17:18;17:19;"That's so menacing."
17:19;17:21;"It's on right after Gentle Jesters."
17:21;17:24;"It's like, yeah, it's a kind vibe Black Mirror."
17:24;17:26;"It's the slowest two hours on TV."
17:26;17:29;"Gentle Jesters into Green Mirror."
17:29;17:30;"[Laughter]"
17:30;17:31;"The whole family can watch it."
17:31;17:32;"I like this movie."
17:32;17:36;"I just—I do like this meeting with him where we're like, you know, we know."
17:36;17:37;"We know the show well."
17:37;17:41;"We're just saying, what if technology isn't so bad?"
17:41;17:42;"Right."
17:42;17:43;"It's not good."
17:43;17:44;"It's just not so bad."
17:44;17:46;"That's our Black Mirror."
17:46;17:49;"We think that would make an interesting show."
17:49;17:53;"Sort of a centrist, like a centrist Black Mirror."
17:53;17:54;"[Laughter]"
17:54;17:56;"It's agnostic."
17:56;17:58;"We're not taking a hard line on technology."
17:58;18:00;"It's really what our version of the show is."
18:00;18:01;"It's nuanced."
18:01;18:06;"Yeah, or just like get an interview with Charlie Brooker and just come in like really aggressive."
18:06;18:11;"Just being like, so your whole show is about this kind of skepticism about where technology is taking us."
18:11;18:17;"Are you aware, sir, that the word technology could refer to basically anything?"
18:17;18:20;"Even something as simple as making guacamole?"
18:20;18:22;"He's like, yes."
18:22;18:24;"Well, defend yourself."
18:24;18:30;"And he's like, I'm talking about modern kind of digital technology, information technology."
18:30;18:31;"All right."
18:31;18:32;"Fair point."
18:32;18:39;"It's amazing how often that movie Yesterday comes up in conversation when—I don't know if any of us have seen it."
18:39;18:40;"I haven't."
18:40;18:41;"I watched it on a plane."
18:41;18:42;"It's a very durable concept."
18:42;18:45;"They could also make—how about this for a streaming service?"
18:45;18:49;"Yesterday the series, every episode's about a different artist."
18:49;18:51;"[Laughter]"
18:51;18:58;"You get into like season four and it's like, dude wakes up and the world's forgotten about the catalog of Boston."
18:58;19:04;"Yeah, a lot of the episodes are just a very confused person just trying to figure out if they can actually do anything with it."
19:04;19:12;"Or just like a super—somebody who knows nothing about music, like super tone deaf, and they just like wake up in a world where like—"
19:12;19:20;"I'm just trying to think of just like some really just kind of like solid but like not particularly beloved like one hit wonder."
19:20;19:23;"Yeah, like how long would it take them to figure that out even?"
19:23;19:24;"It could be like years."
19:24;19:25;"Oh, Gautier?"
19:25;19:30;"Gautier is an interesting fellow because I don't think he ever followed up that album."
19:30;19:33;"So that makes him a hall of famer in my eyes."
19:33;19:36;"I respect the slow pace."
19:36;19:38;"It wouldn't be fair to call him a one hit wonder."
19:38;19:41;"I don't know, what's like a big one hit wonder from like—"
19:41;19:43;"Dancing in the Moonlight by King Harvest."
19:43;19:45;"Yeah, okay, perfect."
19:45;19:53;"Dancing in the Moonlight by King Harvest, although there was a massive version of it in the UK in the 90s, did not cross over in the US at all."
19:53;19:58;"So in a way, this Britpop band called Toploader kind of already did it."
19:58;20:00;"Huh, I never heard that."
20:00;20:01;"Throw on Toploader."
20:01;20:08;"For Gen X English people, this is like one of the biggest songs of their youth."
20:08;20:09;"Really?"
20:09;20:14;"So this band is a one hit wonder with a cover, which I respect."
20:14;20:27;"What a funny trailer. The whole trailer is the guy wakes up and this song."
20:27;20:29;"Never happened."
20:29;20:36;"An English guy wakes up and Toploader—the original did happen, but Toploader didn't cover it in the 90s."
20:36;20:38;"That's even deeper."
20:38;20:44;"He has this deep feeling that English people would freak out for a new version of Dancing in the Moonlight."
20:44;20:49;"But he keeps telling people about Dancing in the Moonlight and they're like, ""No, no, it did come out."""
20:49;20:51;"And he's like, ""No, no, no."""
20:51;20:54;"No, but the Toploader version never came out."
21:07;21:12;"You'd have to have the scene where he's been in this new reality for six months."
21:12;21:16;"He's in a coffee shop and they're playing the King Harvest version."
21:16;21:20;"And he goes, ""It's been a while since I've heard this song."""
21:20;21:24;"But, you know, I really love the 90s Top Sider version."
21:24;21:27;"And then someone's like, ""What's that? What do you mean? That's the reveal."""
21:27;21:31;"And then he's like, ""Well, you know, it was covered in the 90s. I've never heard that."""
21:31;21:33;"Then he starts asking everyone."
21:33;21:35;"Wait, wait, you're kidding me."
21:35;21:42;"Wait, Seinfeld, can you tell me the Toploader version of Dancing in the Moonlight, how high did that chart?"
21:42;21:45;"Toploader? That's a weird name."
21:45;21:47;"Have you ever heard of the band, Jake?"
21:47;21:49;"No, I had no idea this existed."
21:53;21:58;"It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100."
21:58;21:59;"It went to 13?"
21:59;22:00;"That's deep."
22:00;22:02;"Wait, wait, you're looking at the Toploader version?"
22:02;22:06;"No, I'm looking at the King Harvest. My bad. Sorry, guys."
22:06;22:09;"Seinfeld's already living in a world where Toploader's cover never happened."
22:09;22:12;"I think this is a little slower than the original."
22:12;22:14;"Okay, you know what, Seinfeld? I found it, don't worry."
22:14;22:15;"All right."
22:15;22:19;"It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, so it wasn't number one."
22:19;22:25;"It's been certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, so that's a big hit."
22:25;22:26;"What year was it?"
22:26;22:32;"It was actually 2000. It's not 90. Almost 90. It was February 2000."
22:44;22:50;"And then also, if you could pull out a triple platinum hit out of your pocket,"
22:50;22:56;"obviously, you could make some money, but it's just one song."
22:56;23:00;"Are you going to dedicate your whole life to recreating that one hit?"
23:00;23:07;"Also, it would be many years after the Toploader hit actually happened."
23:07;23:11;"You're supposing that if the show is set in 2021,"
23:11;23:14;"and this guy discovers that Toploader never happened,"
23:14;23:17;"that he could somehow turn dancing in the moonlight into a massive hit."
23:17;23:18;"A massive hit now."
23:18;23:22;"The whole point of the Beatles movie is that those songs are timeless."
23:22;23:24;"Yeah, that's a good song."
23:24;23:30;"Right, Jake, you wake up tomorrow, and the Space Hog song, In the Meantime, never came out."
23:30;23:31;"Great song."
23:34;23:38;"But you wake up tomorrow, and you find out that that song never came out."
23:38;23:42;"It would probably take you probably a decade to find out that that song had never come out."
23:42;23:43;"Right."
23:43;23:46;"You quietly slipped onto a different timeline, and you didn't even know."
23:46;23:47;"Right."
23:47;23:49;"That's what the Mandela effect is, actually."
23:49;23:53;"I might not ever find out, because I do hear that song occasionally,"
23:53;23:57;"and when I do, I'm delighted, because it's a great song."
23:57;24:00;"But if I never heard it again..."
24:00;24:02;"You'd never look it up on Apple Music, for example."
24:02;24:05;"It would never occur to me to look it up."
24:05;24:11;"Maybe one day you're doing Jake's 90s alt-rock radio phase,"
24:11;24:13;"and you're like, ""Where's that Space Hog song at?"""
24:13;24:16;"And it's like, ""Huh, I guess they're not on Apple Music. It's not streaming."""
24:16;24:19;"And then you go to Wikipedia, or you look for it on YouTube."
24:19;24:22;"You're like, ""Not on YouTube either. I guess it must be a copyright thing."""
24:22;24:24;"And then you're just like, ""When did that come out?"""
24:24;24:26;"And you type Space Hog into Wikipedia."
24:26;24:28;"Nothing. Now you're sweating."
24:28;24:30;"You're getting that weird pit in your stomach."
24:30;24:34;"And then you call your brother, ""Dave, remember Space Hog?"""
24:34;24:36;"""Remember Space Hog?"""
24:36;24:40;"""No. Remember that song, 'Doon Doon Doon'?"""
24:40;24:42;"""In the meantime?"""
24:42;24:46;"""Dave, I know it's probably been a while, but do you remember Space Hog?"""
24:46;24:50;"""No, you just started calling every rock dude you know in your phone book."""
24:50;24:56;"You know what's funny? I would have no idea when I slipped onto that alternate timeline."
24:56;25:01;"It might have happened yesterday, or it might have happened 10 years ago."
25:01;25:04;"That's really insidious. This is perfect for Green Mirror."
25:04;25:07;"I have a version."
25:07;25:10;"Hold on. Real quick. Then part two."
25:10;25:15;"Once you calm down, you realize that the multiverse theory is real, whatever."
25:15;25:18;"And you're like, ""Whatever. Everything else is business as usual. I'm not going to sweat it."""
25:18;25:22;"But now you're saying to yourself, ""That was a great song."
25:22;25:24;"What are you going to do with it in 2021?"
25:24;25:27;"Are you going to just throw it on the next Mountain Bruise EP?"""
25:27;25:30;"Are you going to be like, ""I'm putting that on the next Mountain Bruise EP."""
25:30;25:33;"Or are you going to be like, ""I'm really going to work this one."
25:33;25:37;"I'm going to hire a radio team because I know."""
25:37;25:44;"The funny thing is that in the movie, he's a songwriter and he remembers all the Beatles songs."
25:44;25:47;"We all remember the Beatles songs."
25:47;25:50;"I remember the Space Hog song, but I don't remember it that well."
25:50;25:55;"I remember he just goes, ""And when the birdland knows where."""
25:55;25:58;"I don't remember any of the lyrics."
25:58;26:02;"It's built around a sample."
26:02;26:10;"It's a Penguin Cafe Orchestra sample of a dial tone that goes, ""Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."""
26:10;26:12;"Ezra clearly knows the song better."
26:12;26:15;"I have a different scenario of how this movie comes about."
26:15;26:18;"It's essentially what we're doing here."
26:18;26:21;"And this is very Green Mirror because we're already connected."
26:21;26:24;"Because we're all separated, we're connected on FaceTime."
26:24;26:26;"We're having the radio show."
26:26;26:28;"We're talking about yesterday."
26:28;26:32;"And then Ezra says, ""Like the Space Hog song."""
26:32;26:36;"We all go, ""What are you talking about?"""
26:36;26:38;"And you're like, ""You know the Space Hog song."""
26:38;26:41;"In the meantime, we're like, ""We don't know what you're talking about."""
26:41;26:42;"And you're like, ""Matt, pull it up."
26:42;26:44;"Matt, we don't know what you're talking about."
26:44;26:47;"There's no Space Hog song called 'Ain't No Man.'"""
26:47;26:48;"And not seeing it."
26:48;26:50;"And then you have to make a decision at this moment."
26:50;26:54;"""Oh, sorry. Had a brain fart. That isn't a song."""
26:54;27:00;"And you make the decision now that Vampire Weekend can put out in the meantime."
27:00;27:03;"You have a moment where no one knows the song."
27:03;27:05;"And you're like, ""Oh, I have this thing that is mine."""
27:05;27:08;"And now you actually do have to then also contend with the fact"
27:08;27:11;"that you've slipped into an alternate timeline"
27:11;27:14;"where things are going but that song doesn't exist."
27:14;27:18;"You are still in a band that has a huge platform."
27:18;27:20;"You're a songwriter. You do know the music."
27:20;27:23;"I'm sitting there with Arielle who wouldn't remember the song"
27:23;27:25;"either if it doesn't exist in this timeline."
27:25;27:27;"And I'm playing it for him."
27:27;27:30;"And he's just like, ""It sounds like a little '90s, dude."""
27:30;27:36;"And I'll be like, ""Uh, okay. Good call. That's true."
27:36;27:38;"Goodyear, man. That's what I was referencing."
27:38;27:42;"Guilty as charged. I was going for a bit of a '90s thing."
27:42;27:45;"But yeah, let's just freshen it up for 2021."""
27:45;27:48;"And I'll just be like, ""I mean, yeah. What'd you have in mind?"""
27:48;27:52;"And I'll be like, ""Um, yeah. I wonder if what I could--"
27:52;27:54;"Okay, we got to listen to it now."""
27:54;27:57;"And then, of course, the movie's called In the Meantime."

38:53;39:00;"And basically the whole bit is that we send Paul McCartney to meetings with powerful, highly weird executives."
39:00;39:02;"And Paul pitches them."
39:02;39:06;"He's sitting there with like the head of Amazon or whatever."
39:06;39:09;"And Paul's like, ""All right. So the idea..."""
39:09;39:10;"Oh God, I can't do it at all."
39:10;39:12;"I'm just going to do an American accent."
39:12;39:14;"""All right. So here's the idea, man."
39:14;39:17;"Imagine a world where all of our beloved songs don't exist."
39:17;39:19;"There's only one guy, young fella."
39:19;39:21;"He's the only one who remembers our music."
39:21;39:24;"And he uses our songs to become a superstar."
39:24;39:28;"But he was a songwriter, so he has to wrestle with his own feelings of self-worth."""
39:28;39:32;"And the guy's like, ""Oh, Paul. That sounds like the movie 'Yesterday'."""
39:32;39:34;"No. Never in a million years."
39:34;39:35;"Never in a million years."
39:35;39:37;"This is a brilliant idea."
39:37;39:40;"Because if it's Paul McCartney, they'll never ever say it."
39:40;39:41;"They'll never correct him."
39:41;39:45;"They'll be so excited to be in a room with Paul McCartney that when he starts walking through..."
39:45;39:48;"And the more they are like, ""Oh, interesting idea,"""
39:48;39:51;"knowing full well it's a movie, and they'll wait for him to leave being like,"
39:51;39:53;"""Did he have a stroke? What's going on?"""
39:53;39:58;"He has to keep walking through the beats, basically, of the movie's thing."
39:58;40:00;"And so I've sort of beaded it out already."
40:00;40:01;"So it's like he wakes up and just..."
40:01;40:03;"They'll never stop him."
40:03;40:05;"They'll be too embarrassed."
40:05;40:07;"So he'll get to just walk through the whole movie and go,"
40:07;40:09;"""So, are we looking at a green light?"""
40:09;40:11;"We're really excited here, Paul."
40:11;40:14;"Okay. That's perfect for gentle gestures."
40:14;40:21;"It's actually so painful to think about that moment that it's almost too not gentle."
40:21;40:24;"That could become a go-to gentle gestures segment"
40:24;40:27;"is that we get various classic rock legends."
40:27;40:32;"Yeah, maybe the next episode, it's Bruce Springsteen also pitching ""Yesterday,"""
40:32;40:35;"except he's actually pitching it about the Beatles."
40:35;40:38;"They're like, ""Wait, Bruce, do you mean the movie 'Yesterday' but with your songs?"""
40:38;40:40;"""No, no, no. This has nothing to do with my songs."
40:40;40:43;"This is about a world where the Beatles never existed."""
40:43;40:44;"""Okay, Bruce."""
40:44;40:45;"""And what's 'Yesterday'?"""
40:45;40:49;"I mean, that's rich."
40:49;40:52;"You could have Bruce Willis pitching ""Die Hard."""
40:52;40:53;"I mean, you could..."
40:53;40:54;"Oh, yeah."
40:54;40:55;"Yeah, you could..."
40:55;40:58;"Harrison Ford pitching ""The Fugitive."""
40:58;40:59;"Just whatever."
40:59;41:01;"I mean, it's endless."
41:01;41:06;"The only criterion is you have to be very famous and over 65."
41:06;41:07;"Yeah, old."
41:07;41:08;"Retirement age."
41:08;41:12;"So this is almost like a new series for the gentle gestures prank network."
41:12;41:14;"We're kind of building out."
41:14;41:17;"If it really takes off, we could spin it off to be its own show."
41:17;41:18;"Its own channel."
41:18;41:19;"Like, own."
41:19;41:26;"We're definitely going to have Gigi TV one of these days."
41:26;41:28;"Is this going to circle back to Aaron Lewis?"
41:28;41:29;"Oh, yeah, of course."
41:29;41:32;"Aaron Lewis wakes up in a reality where it's been a while."
41:32;41:34;"It was not a huge hit."
41:34;41:39;"Aaron Lewis wakes up and is the only person he remembers in the meantime."
41:39;41:41;"Well, it's not really my aesthetic."
41:41;41:45;"Aaron Lewis is like, ""I'm not into that '70s David Bowie crap."""
41:45;41:50;"Sorry, I can't stop thinking about just the most awkward ones possible."
41:50;41:55;"Okay, yeah, so it's time to get back to Aaron Lewis."
41:55;41:59;"Let's get back on ""track,"" quote unquote."
41:59;42:05;"So Aaron Lewis, you probably know him from the amazing ""Stayin'"" song,"
42:05;42:07;"""It's Been Awhile."""
42:07;42:09;"Can we hear that?"
42:09;42:13;"Yeah, let's start with that before we get to his ""4th of July"" song."
42:13;42:20;"So this is '96, '97?"
42:20;42:23;"I think later. What year is this?"
42:23;42:25;"This is off their first record, right?"
42:25;42:27;"Or maybe not. No, it's not. Later."
42:27;42:29;"2001."
42:29;42:31;"2001, okay."
42:31;42:34;"Pre or post 9/11?"
42:34;42:37;"July of 2001, I'm guessing."
42:37;42:40;"I need an actual date on this."
42:40;42:43;"March 27, 2001."
42:43;42:44;"Okay."
42:44;42:50;"While we listen, can I just pitch one more of these Sir Paul Gentilchester things?"
42:50;42:57;"I just think there's a moment where some exec sort of has the gumption to be like,"
42:57;43:00;"""I'm so sorry, but this is a movie."""
43:00;43:03;"And he's just like, ""Bullsh*t."""
43:03;43:06;"Paul McCartney's like, ""What the f*ck are you talking about?"""
43:06;43:08;"And he's like, ""No, no, come around to my side of the desk."""
43:08;43:12;"And he pulls up the trailer to ""Yesterday."""
43:12;43:13;"And they're sitting there watching."
43:13;43:18;"So it's Paul McCartney with this Warner Brothers executive watching the trailer."
43:18;43:22;"And just Paul McCartney gets so angry."
43:22;43:26;"Like, he's just like, ""I'm lawyer-ing."""
43:26;43:28;"""I never clear this."""
43:28;43:31;"And the guy's like, ""Oh my god, I was just trying to sort of help."""
43:31;43:33;"And he's like, ""I'm lawyer-ing up."""
43:33;43:36;"Like, just really pushes it."
43:36;43:39;"Gets a little aggressive, like the way you've never seen Paul McCartney."
43:39;43:41;"I mean, it's all a bit."
43:41;43:42;"So ultimately be gentle."
43:42;43:43;"The guy's like, ""No, no, no, it's sorry."""
43:43;43:45;"And he just starts getting like sweating."
43:45;43:46;"You know what I mean?"
43:46;43:47;"He's just getting red face."
43:47;43:50;"We're asking a lot of Sir Paul on the acting front, but I think he's ready for it."
43:50;43:51;"I think he could do it."
43:51;43:53;"And then I think it's super funny when he comes out."
43:53;43:55;"And he's just like, ""Oh, you've been gestured."""
43:55;43:58;"We actually never came up with our, ""You've been punked."""
43:58;43:59;"Have we?"
43:59;44:01;"Like, we don't have the thing."
44:01;44:02;"What's the expose?"
44:02;44:05;"You've been gently gestured."
44:05;44:07;"You've been gently gestured."
44:07;44:10;"That's like our producer tag."
44:10;44:12;"You've been gently gestured."
44:12;44:15;"Matt reminds us, I think you had a whisper."
44:15;44:17;"It's just like, ""Gentle gestures."""
44:17;44:20;"I think you had a whisper."
44:20;44:21;"But I like it being, ""You've been."""
44:21;44:22;"I like the action."
44:22;44:26;"You've been gently gestured."
44:26;44:28;"You've been gently gestured."
44:28;44:49;"I've got to say, the song sounds pretty good to me."
44:49;44:51;"It's more tasteful than I thought it would be."
44:51;44:53;"Yeah, it's funny how that works."
44:53;44:55;"I remember when it was a hit, I was just like..."
44:55;44:56;"Did you hate it?"
44:56;44:58;"I hated it so much back in '01."
44:58;45:08;"I was just like, ""God, I hate the direction that alt-rock radio's gone with this kind of just really heavy, super serious..."""
45:08;45:13;"I mean, I liked Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, who were heavy and super serious."
45:13;45:16;"Yeah, they're the predecessors for this."
45:16;45:17;"Yeah."
45:17;45:20;"They were like protégés of Limp Bizkit?"
45:20;45:22;"Well, we'll get into that."
45:22;45:32;"Because, yeah, when Ezra sent the Fourth of July song to The Thread a few weeks ago, it really opened a whole discussion up on Stained and Aaron..."
45:32;45:34;"What's his name? Aaron Lewis?"
45:34;45:35;"Aaron Lewis."
45:35;45:39;"And yeah, did some serious Wikipedia stuff."
45:39;45:51;"But I remember in that article, it was fascinating that they toured with Limp Bizkit, and Fred Durst was apparently very disturbed by their first album cover."
45:51;45:52;"Because it was satanic?"
45:52;45:57;"Yeah, just in that way that heavy bands in the '80s and '90s would just be like..."
45:57;46:09;"I don't know, just have a bloody doll or a bunch of crosses or just kind of ""dark"" subject matter in this really cartoonish way."
46:09;46:11;"And Durst seemed to take it super seriously."
46:11;46:14;"I don't know if Durst was Christian or what the story was."
46:14;46:18;"Limp Bizkit was heavy, but they weren't really devilish."
46:18;46:19;"Right."
46:19;46:20;"Was that car horn honking?"
46:20;46:25;"Yeah, that's me, sorry. I mean, it's not my car, but there's an alarm going off."
46:25;46:30;"Oh, damn. It's all good. Leave it in."
46:30;46:34;"So Fred Durst thought that Stained was maybe a little bit devilish."
46:34;46:42;"I find that so hard to believe. You would think a guy like Fred Durst knows that none of those bands are actually devilish."
46:42;46:44;"It's very strange. I mean..."
46:44;46:51;"Well, hold on. This is becoming a straight up Stained episode. This is a Yesterday Meets Stained episode."
46:51;47:00;"So let's talk about the actual origins of Stained and Aaron Lewis as we build up to the big reveal of Aaron Lewis's Fourth of July song."
47:00;47:03;"Born in Springfield, Vermont in '72."
47:03;47:05;"That's a real Gen Xer."
47:05;47:13;"That's the heart of Gen X, really. His parents apparently were like hippies who were living in a log cabin in Vermont."
47:13;47:17;"So picture that. Oh, actually, this kind of reminds me in a weird way."
47:17;47:25;"I'd sent to the thread earlier today that I discovered that Tucker Carlson was born in the Mission District of San Francisco in 1969."
47:25;47:35;"Again, just a weird, like, not what you expect. He kind of went the opposite direction of the ethos of the time and place he was born."
47:35;47:41;"Tucker Carlson literally was a baby like a few doors down from the Grateful Dead, who he became a big fan of."
47:41;47:48;"Yeah, he is a deadhead. But like, you know, on this show, we're obsessed with 1969 California."
47:48;47:52;"The gap opened. Also in San Francisco."
47:52;47:55;"That's true. That's funny, actually."
47:55;48:02;"Whoa, that's also pretty deep. Oh, God. I mean, at this point in the show's history, we just have so many like rich veins we can go down."
48:02;48:17;"Like I can imagine us doing like a solid 45 on the CIA, like dosing baby Tucker Carlson in 1969 San Francisco as part of the MKUltra experiments to create a right wing news
anchor."
48:17;48:20;"But anyway, we won't go down that route. Save that for another show."
48:20;48:30;"Yeah, save it for another show. So Aaron Lewis, I don't know how he politically identifies, but you know, his music and his solo career kind of leans conservative."
48:30;48:35;"Maybe you could say right wing. So it's interesting that he was born in Vermont to hippie parents."
48:35;48:40;"Right. I would say since the Trump era has started, he's full Trump train. He wears a MAGA hat."
48:40;48:44;"Oh, he wears a MAGA hat. OK. I don't know what his deal was like, you know, 15 years."
48:44;48:48;"I'm looking at a photo of him where he's wearing an impeach Biden hat."
48:48;48:55;"OK. In 2020, Lewis said of his political views, I'm sure that some stained fans don't feel the same way as I do."
48:55;49:02;"The way I look at it is if I offend you with my point of view, then good. You need to you need something to snap you out of your slumber."
49:02;49:07;"Slumber. Kind of poetic word there. Yeah. Kind of a delicate word."
49:07;49:11;"Listen, man, you're in like a gentle slumber of deception."
49:11;49:18;"Wake up, mother. You're slumbering. You're brainwashed by the liberal media, man."
49:18;49:26;"You're in a deep slumber. Well, he's a wordsmith. He's a poet. He can't help it."
49:26;49:30;"And my point that I'll be making on today's show is that he is a good songwriter."
49:30;49:37;"So his parents were hippies born in Vermont. Obviously, he's been on quite a journey in his 49 years on Earth."
49:37;49:44;"Yeah. So he was raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is like southern Massachusetts near the Connecticut border."
49:44;49:53;"That's where the Basketball Hall of Fame is. And the band started in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is a weird place for a band to start."
49:53;49:58;"Like he met like all the guys from Stained are from Springfield. What is that alarm going off?"
49:58;50:07;"This car alarm is. Pre-recorded internet radio, folks. You know how it is. There's only so much we can do."
50:07;50:15;"So Stained started out covering Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Tool and Alice in Chains. Sounds about right."
50:15;50:21;"And then started putting out records. Fred Durst co-produced their first album."
50:21;50:28;"They toured with Limp Bizkit and then It's Been A While propelled them to the top of the charts."
50:28;50:34;"The album that It's Been A While is on, which is their third album, debuted at number one on Billboard's top 200 album charts,"
50:34;50:40;"selling 716,000 copies in its first week, which is insane by modern standards."
50:40;50:47;"So they're a big fat band, did their thing for a while, lineup changes."
50:47;50:53;"And then around 2014, they went on hiatus and Aaron Lewis wanted to play solo shows."
50:53;51:00;"And then he basically became, I guess, like a country singer. It actually makes a lot of sense."
51:00;51:11;"It's not like he fully abandoned the vibe of Stained. In his solo career, it's country, but it's kind of dark and he sounds like himself."
51:11;51:18;"So, I don't know. He said in a 2011 interview that he was introduced to country music as a child by his grandfather,"
51:18;51:21;"but his interest was rekindled when he toured with Kid Rock."
51:21;51:23;"Oh yeah, hell yeah."
51:23;51:27;"Just like Kid Rock, who made an interesting transition from kind of hard rock to country."
51:27;51:31;"Aaron Lewis kind of following in his footsteps, and I think he's been fairly successful."
51:31;51:36;"I mean, both those guys are, it's the transition from hard rock to country, but it's really,"
51:36;51:41;"they're basically doing the same thing with just a little country window dressing."
51:41;51:47;"And I guess as America became more polarized, they had to, and I mean, I've said some version of this before,"
51:47;51:53;"that there was something about alternative rock used to be this kind of consensus music,"
51:53;52:00;"at least for a certain type of white dude. It was like this middle ground where the different polarities could meet."
52:00;52:02;"Yeah, Pearl Jam and the Chili Peppers rule."
52:02;52:10;"Yeah, or like, you love Soundgarden? Hey man, I don't know if you're from Alabama, California, Connecticut."
52:10;52:15;"I don't know if you voted for Bill Clinton or George H.W. Bush, but you're alright with me, man,"
52:15;52:19;"because you got good taste in hard rock. That's what it was like back then."
52:19;52:20;"Totally."
52:20;52:28;"Yeah, consensus bands. But then as America became more polarized, enter the Trump era,"
52:28;52:34;"there's no consensus kind of music like that. So if you're a right winger, you probably gravitate a little more"
52:34;52:39;"towards country because obviously there's country of all political persuasions,"
52:39;52:44;"but there's something about that move where you are kind of like saying, I'm on this side."
52:44;52:46;"Yeah, American flags, pickup trucks."
52:46;52:51;"Yeah, if you're going for that type of country. I'm sure some people do."
52:51;52:57;"They'll make like an alt-country kind of liberal Willie Nelson, smoke weed kind of album,"
52:57;53:03;"but yeah, this is a different thing. And maybe it also just has to do with like watching the bottom fall out."
53:03;53:07;"Hearing that rock was played out, dawg. He heard it loud and clear."
53:07;53:14;"Stand-up I'm sure was doing fine, but you know, maybe he realized, man, we sold 716,000 albums in a week once."
53:14;53:19;"I want to try something different. I did my thing with rock music. Let's try something different."
53:19;53:24;"We can go through some of his solo career, but we might as well start with his 4th of July song now called,"
53:24;53:30;"Am I the Only One? So I assume that this song is probably not getting like a ton of support"
53:30;53:36;"at the streaming services, but it was briefly number one on the iTunes music store."
53:36;53:43;"So clearly it's resonating with some group of people. And I listened to it and just a warning to our listeners."
53:43;53:48;"This is a conservative country song, but it's interesting to listen to it."
53:48;53:53;"I think we certainly get a window into how Aaron Lewis is feeling about the state of the nation"
53:53;53:57;"and probably what quite a few other people are feeling given the relative success of the song."
53:57;54:01;"And I was, even though I don't agree with the political message of the song,"
54:01;54:07;"I was struck by the fact that he is a very competent songwriter, but let's listen to it."
54:07;54:11;"Also just to give people a sense of what his music sounds like now."
54:17;54:22;"And of course him dropping this right around the 4th of July was kind of like a call to arms."
54:29;54:34;"Am I the only one here tonight?"
54:34;54:38;"Shaking my head and thinking something ain't right."
54:38;54:42;"Is it just me? Am I losing my mind?"
54:42;54:46;"Am I standing on the edge of the end of time?"
54:46;54:51;"Am I the only one? Tell me I'm not."
54:51;54:57;"Who thinks of taking all the good we got and turning it back?"
54:57;55:03;"Hell, I'll be damned. I think I'm turning into my old man."
55:03;55:06;"But your old man was a hippie. Big question."
55:06;55:11;"Am I the only one willing to bleed?"
55:11;55:15;"Or take a bullet for being free?"
55:15;55:21;"Screaming ""What the fuck"" in my TV for telling me,"
55:21;55:27;"Yeah, you're telling me that I'm the only one willing to fight."
55:27;55:29;"He's got an ear for melody. He really does."
55:29;55:34;"Yeah. I heard the song once and I remember almost the entire thing."
55:34;55:40;"Burning on the ground, another statue coming down in a town near you."
55:40;55:45;"Watching the threads of old glory come undone."
55:45;55:47;"Wait, pause it for a sec."
55:47;55:51;"So the first two verses are pretty good."
55:51;55:55;"Am I the only one here tonight? Shaking my head, thinking something's not right."
55:55;55:58;"And then he's talking about standing on the edge of the end of time."
55:58;56:00;"That's something everyone can relate to, you know?"
56:00;56:03;"That first verse could be a Mountain Bruce song."
56:03;56:04;"Absolutely."
56:04;56:09;"Yeah, just sort of like end of history kind of vibes of like, where are we headed?"
56:09;56:13;"Right, that's a general feeling a lot of people have."
56:13;56:14;"Something's not right."
56:14;56:16;"And then the next verse is great too."
56:16;56:18;"Am I the only one?"
56:18;56:20;"And it's turning bad. Hell, I'll be damned."
56:20;56:22;"I think I'm turning into my old man."
56:22;56:24;"Again, totally universal."
56:24;56:27;"Like, as you get older, maybe you get a little crankier."
56:27;56:31;"Maybe you look at what's happening with younger people with greater skepticism."
56:31;56:32;"It's classic."
56:32;56:33;"Yeah."
56:33;56:34;"You turn into your parents."
56:34;56:37;"Things annoy you that you never dreamed would annoy you."
56:37;56:39;"It doesn't have to be political."
56:39;56:43;"Just like, God, why are the neighbors making so much noise? Whatever."
56:43;56:45;"Yeah, why is that car alarm going off?"
56:45;56:47;"And then he gets to the chorus."
56:47;56:48;"It turns on the chorus."
56:48;56:50;"That's when you understand."
56:50;56:54;"Am I the only one willing to bleed or take a bullet for being free?"
56:54;56:55;"It's like, dude."
56:55;56:58;"Well, it's also so zero to a hundred."
56:58;56:59;"What?"
56:59;57:02;"I thought we were just talking about the end of history, man."
57:02;57:03;"And getting old."
57:03;57:06;"I just thought we were talking about aging and weird vibes."
57:06;57:08;"Now you're willing to take a bullet?"
57:08;57:12;"And also, dude, you're not serving in the military."
57:12;57:14;"What are you talking about?"
57:14;57:17;"I love the screaming ""what the f***"" at my TV."
57:17;57:19;"It totally reminds me of that Will Ferrell bit."
57:19;57:22;"There's a movie where he's singing in a wedding band."
57:22;57:24;"And he's like, ""I really need you tonight."""
57:24;57:25;"That's not Will Ferrell."
57:25;57:28;"""I really f***ing need you."" Who is that?"
57:28;57:31;"That's the Dan band in Wedding Crashers."
57:31;57:32;"Okay."
57:32;57:33;"Right? Or no, no."
57:33;57:34;"What are those movies?"
57:34;57:36;"No, it's in a Will Ferrell movie."
57:36;57:41;"And it's the band where the wedding singer just adds ""f***"" into the songs."
57:41;57:43;"""I f***ing need you tonight."""
57:43;57:45;"[Laughter]"
57:45;57:48;"The way he crams that ""f***"" into this chorus is like..."
57:48;57:50;"Well, also, one thing I'll say."
57:50;57:54;"I'm praising him as a songwriter because I do think he's a talented songwriter"
57:54;57:56;"with an ear for melody and a way with words."
57:56;58:00;"And I'm willing to believe he has other songs that go a little bit deeper."
58:00;58:06;"But it's like, this is just totally polarized America where you don't have to..."
58:06;58:09;"I'd be interested to hear a song where he really lays it out,"
58:09;58:10;"what his problem is."
58:10;58:12;"Like more specifically, you mean?"
58:12;58:14;"Yeah, because sometimes the world seems so polarized."
58:14;58:17;"Somebody might say, ""Well, I think this aspect..."""
58:17;58:18;"You know, you never know."
58:18;58:19;"Right-wingers, left-wingers."
58:19;58:22;"Somebody could say, ""No, I don't like this whole surveillance state thing"
58:22;58:23;"that we don't have any privacy."""
58:23;58:26;"A left-winger might say, ""You know what, Aaron? I agree with you, man."
58:26;58:27;"We're not so different."""
58:27;58:30;"So it'd be one thing if he went through all of his specific issues"
58:30;58:31;"with modern culture."
58:31;58:34;"But when you write a song that basically is just like,"
58:34;58:37;"""Am I the only one who thinks s*** is f***ed up? Am I right?"""
58:37;58:40;"You're basically just saying, ""If you're on Team MAGA,"
58:40;58:43;"I'm just here to tell you I agree with you."""
58:43;58:46;"You're not getting into it, what actually unites them."
58:46;58:48;"The ideology, you're just like, ""Something's f***ed up,"
58:48;58:50;"and we all agree with it."""
58:50;58:51;"And it's like, ""All right, so what is it?"""
58:51;58:54;"You're going to take a bullet for some vague thing?"
58:54;58:56;"Who's shooting the bullet?"
58:56;59:00;"But again, he knows that you get people fired up"
59:00;59:01;"with that kind of language."
59:01;59:05;"And again, it is a smart conceit, I guess, for a song."
59:05;59:08;"When you say some s*** like, ""Am I the only one?"""
59:08;59:11;"Because I watched the lyric video on YouTube,"
59:11;59:13;"so you can imagine that because the song's called"
59:13;59:14;"""Am I the only one?"""
59:14;59:16;"and that's the question that he asks throughout,"
59:16;59:17;"""Am I the only one?"""
59:17;59:19;"you can imagine what all the YouTube comments were."
59:19;59:22;"""Absolutely not, Aaron. You are far from the only one."
59:22;59:23;"I'm with you here, brother."""
59:23;59:24;"""You're not alone, brother."""
59:24;59:26;"""You're not alone, brother."
59:26;59:27;"You're definitely not the only one."""
59:27;59:31;"See, to me, I immediately applied that TC logic to the song,"
59:31;59:32;"and I was sort of like..."
59:32;59:34;"That rigorous TC logic?"
59:34;59:37;"Why are you asking this question, even rhetorically?"
59:37;59:39;"Obviously, you're not the only one."
59:39;59:40;"Right."
59:40;59:42;"You're representing a viewpoint that half the country feels,"
59:42;59:43;"more or less."
59:43;59:45;"Do you not follow politics?"
59:45;59:47;"Do you watch Fox News?"
59:47;59:50;"Let's get into the next verse."
59:50;59:51;"Yeah, yeah."
59:51;59:53;"♪ Am I the only one? ♪"
59:53;59:56;"♪ Not brainwashed? ♪"
59:56;01:00:00;"♪ Making my way through the land of the lost ♪"

01:00:04;01:00:07;"♪ As they try to undo one thing ♪"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"It's almost like a Mr. Show, David Cross or something."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yeah."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I do appreciate him just dropping a ""f*** him to s***"""
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Wait, he just did another one."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"He did another one."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Wait, back it up, back it up."

01:00:48;01:00:49;"He keeps climbing."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"It's quite memorable."
01:00:50;01:00:54;"He keeps climbing and this song really does have peaks and valleys."
01:00:54;01:00:59;"Again, I imagine most of our listeners do not agree with the political message, but the-"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Ezra respects the craft."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I respect the craft."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"And when he hits the-"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"And also, I do think this is some interesting s*** to know what's going on."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"This is what the dude from ""Stained"" is up to now."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"We're learning something."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"But yeah, even when he hits the-"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"♪ If you don't like it, here's the f***ing door ♪"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"It might make you laugh."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"It might make you cry."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"But either way, it pops out."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"You know, the song has like contours."
01:01:22;01:01:29;"Maybe one day I'll run into Aaron Lewis somewhere in rural Massachusetts and we could chop it up a little bit."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"I'd love to pick his brand, but I'm sure he's got plenty to say."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"I was picturing you guys sitting at the same Grammy's table."
01:01:36;01:01:37;"[laughter]"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Remember?"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"Didn't you sit at a table with the Florida Georgia like that?"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Yeah, with Florida Georgia line."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"Not that much of a stretch."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"Yeah, I didn't get to talk to those guys."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Those guys are gentle jesters for sure."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Well, actually, I heard something about them recently."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Who was I talking to?"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"Man, who the f*** was I talking to? I can't remember."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"[laughter]"
01:01:57;01:02:02;"Just gonna start driving like really aggressive f***s throughout this show."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"F-bombs."
01:02:03;01:02:07;"I was talking to somebody and I said, ""Oh, what's up with Florida Georgia line?"""
01:02:07;01:02:11;"I like those guys. I really like their manager who I got to talk to."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"And maybe I'm speaking out of turn."
01:02:14;01:02:19;"I hope this wasn't a country music insider who told me this and I wasn't supposed to say anything."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Although I don't really know any country music insiders, so I imagine it's just a random person."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Just probably read it in Us Weekly."
01:02:24;01:02:31;"But they said that they heard that Florida and Georgia were going through a tense period because of politics."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Oh, wow."
01:02:33;01:02:40;"Maybe Georgia went blue like the state did and maybe Florida went red and they're just having a tough time with that."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"Although I would say, you know what fellas? Just lean into it."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"You could gently jest with each other on stage."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Yeah, sounds rich."
01:02:47;01:02:51;"Maybe each of you goes to a different side of the stage and is just like,"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"""If you love the Democratic Party, make some f***ing noise!"""
01:02:54;01:02:57;"And then Florida's like, ""Alright, alright, alright."""
01:02:57;01:02:59;"[laughter]"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"Now my Republicans, can we beat that?"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"Kind of McConaughey."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"And then, yeah, just like total vaudeville."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Georgia's just like shaking his head, ""No, no, no."""
01:03:08;01:03:14;"And Florida comes out like, ""Now if you really love the Republicans, make some noise!"""
01:03:14;01:03:18;"And then Georgia's, you know, they get a response. Anyway, I hope they work it out."
01:03:18;01:03:22;"Well, they've come out with a song called ""Undivided."""
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Okay, so maybe this was just out there. This was out there in the culture."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Let's hit that next."
01:03:25;01:03:32;"Yeah, and this is pretty recent. They definitely are politically different,"
01:03:32;01:03:36;"but they've said that they will not let it get between them."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Alright, let's keep going with this, Aaron Lewis."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"I just wanted to say one line that jumped out to me."
01:03:40;01:03:45;"And this is where I would appreciate, maybe next Fourth of July he'll drop a song"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"that gets a little more into his deep political philosophy."
01:03:48;01:03:53;"But when you say some s*** like, ""If you don't like it, there's the f***ing door!"""
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Which he did deliver really well."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"But when you say, ""If you don't like it, there's the f***ing door!"""
01:03:58;01:04:02;"It's also like, ""Well, come on, Aaron. You're the one who doesn't like it."""
01:04:02;01:04:05;"You know what I mean, man? I'm with you."
01:04:05;01:04:10;"If somebody wanted to say, ""I only want to live in a country with chill people,"""
01:04:10;01:04:15;"I understand that sensibility. I would love to be in a world with more chill people,"
01:04:15;01:04:19;"people who appreciate kind vibes, people who have a chill worldview."
01:04:19;01:04:23;"I don't think that corresponds to any end of the political spectrum."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"But again, you're the one who's very fired up and angry."
01:04:26;01:04:30;"So that gets into this weird philosophical question."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"What is America?"
01:04:32;01:04:37;"So the people who you think don't like America, well, you also don't like America."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"What are we talking about?"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I mean, maybe move to Canada, Aaron."
01:04:41;01:04:46;"I mean, you were born pretty close to there, sir. Up in Vermont, you know?"
01:04:46;01:04:50;"Okay, let's get—what else? Oh, all right. We got some really good s*** left in this song, actually."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah, yeah. Let's keep going."
01:04:51;01:04:56;"Am I the only one willing to fight"
01:04:56;01:05:02;"For my love of the red and white and the blue?"
01:05:02;01:05:08;"Burning on the ground, another statue coming down in a town near"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"Who cares about the statues? I know."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"He doesn't care about the statues."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"He doesn't care about the statues."
01:05:14;01:05:18;"Name ten Confederate generals."
01:05:18;01:05:24;"This also struck me as so weird for someone that's not even from the South."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Right."
01:05:25;01:05:30;"Although he has a song called ""Northern Red Knight."""
01:05:30;01:05:34;"This is the bridge that made me give it up and say, ""This man is a talented songwriter."""
01:05:34;01:05:39;"Am I the only one who quit singing along"
01:05:39;01:05:44;"Every time they play a Springsteen song?"
01:05:44;01:05:48;"Which begs the question, was he ever a Springsteen fan?"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Oh, yes. We gotta pause that."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"I'm gonna sing now."
01:05:50;01:05:54;"I mean, first of all, I was kind of like half watching the lyric video that"
01:05:54;01:05:59;"you can imagine that when we got to that bridge, that's when I was like sending to the TC thread."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Everybody needs to hear this."
01:06:00;01:06:06;"'Cause everything about it is like, first of all, this very gentle Beatles-esque bridge."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Yeah, with like the cellos."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"The ascending strings."
01:06:10;01:06:16;"And again, a real panache for like peaks and valleys in a song."
01:06:16;01:06:20;"He knew that this was like a true shots fired thing where he goes,"
01:06:20;01:06:23;"Am I the only one who quit singing along"
01:06:23;01:06:28;"Every time I hear a Springsteen song?"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"Gets so quiet. Music totally vanishes."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"Like really, he wants you to sit with that."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"I mean, I wonder if he's gonna become like president or something one day."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"That just came to mind."
01:06:38;01:06:44;"Like the same way that like Trump just had like the kind of like the gift of like public speaking."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"He knew to get real quiet there."
01:06:46;01:06:50;"Maybe that does resonate with a certain type of right winger"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"who loved Springsteen in the 80s and really is disheartened"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"that he's just like, well, full Democratic operative."
01:06:57;01:07:01;"Although it's hilarious though, 'cause Springsteen's politics really haven't changed."
01:07:01;01:07:05;"Right. Springsteen was never right wing."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Yeah. I mean, yeah, it'd be one thing to be like,"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"Oh man, I wish Bruce got out there for Bernie."
01:07:10;01:07:14;"But obviously that's not where Aaron Lewis is coming from."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Yeah. Did Aaron Lewis love Springsteen?"
01:07:15;01:07:19;"I mean, I know a lot of country people love Springsteen because he's a great writer."
01:07:19;01:07:26;"And he kind of, Springsteen had his, worked within the country idiom on many an occasion as well."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"He's definitely got a deep love of the genre."
01:07:28;01:07:32;"My guess he was not just based on the stained aesthetic."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"He was not a Springsteen fan ever."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"I could be totally wrong, but that's just a hunch."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"I think he was into heavier music."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"Well, that also begs the question, to what extent is he kind of playing a character here?"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Like he just knows what's a good line."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Like he knew that, hell, I'll be damned."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"I think I'm turning into my old man."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"Meanwhile, his old man is like a full gentle jester,"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"like bald dude with like a gray ponytail pulled around the sides,"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"like a tie-dye shirt."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"And yeah, Birkenstock saw the dead 70 times."
01:08:03;01:08:07;"And he's just like, ""Well, Dad, what'd you think of the new song?"""
01:08:07;01:08:11;"And he's like, ""You know, Aaron, man, I really,"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"I feel that you've kind of portrayed me in kind of a strange way."
01:08:14;01:08:18;"You seem really fired up about some weird stuff."
01:08:18;01:08:21;"We need to see each other in person sometime, man."""
01:08:21;01:08:25;"So I think he's taking a little poetic license here"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"because there's a quote where he says, ""I wrote this song because I'm sitting here"
01:08:28;01:08:31;"as a 49-year-old father of three watching a very small handful of people"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"destroy the country that was handed down to me by my forefathers,"
01:08:34;01:08:38;"the country that my grandfather and my uncles, they fought for,"""
01:08:38;01:08:40;"notably leaving out his dad, right?"
01:08:40;01:08:44;"So I think he's probably like, ""Oh, my dad was this kind of black sheep"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"of the family."""
01:08:46;01:08:52;"And so it just doesn't sound as, you know, poetic to say,"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"you know, ""Am I turning into my uncle?"""
01:08:59;01:09:02;"""Goddamn, I think I'm turning into my uncle."""
01:09:02;01:09:05;"""My uncle, man."""
01:09:05;01:09:07;"That's a better line, but that's--wow."
01:09:07;01:09:12;"And then on the Springsteen side, I think that obviously"

01:09:34;01:09:36;"and really wearing that on his sleeve."

01:22:57;01:23:00;"Northern redneck, that's some real country music."

01:23:02;01:23:06;"playing a concert in Massachusetts somewhere,"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"and there's, like, just a bunch of people"

01:23:10;01:23:11;"to the northern redneck?"
01:23:11;01:23:14;"You didn't think northern redneck sounded sort of"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"just a bit on the nose, like, musically, like,"
01:23:17;01:23:18;"LARPing almost?"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Like, something about--"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Well, I was-- I was recording."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"No, but I'm saying that the actual Fourth of July"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"one sounds, to me, like country sounds."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"-It's compassionate. -There actually aren't--"
01:23:27;01:23:30;"Yeah, and there aren't country artists putting out things"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"like northern redneck."
01:23:31;01:23:34;"-It's almost like Charlie Daniels-y or something. -There are."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"It seems like signifiers more."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"I wonder if any country artists were like,"

01:23:51;01:23:54;"with the accent, is,"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"why couldn't he have sung northern redneck"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"in a proud northern accent?"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"I gotta say it, it's Borgesian."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"You're writing a song about how it's not all about"
01:24:03;01:24:06;"a southern man, and that northern rednecks are a thing, too,"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"because they also have a type of rural culture"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"that connects to country music,"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"but then you sing in this real southern accent,"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"'cause, I mean, or am I tripping?"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Is there some part of, like, western Massachusetts"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"where people say ""y'all""?"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"I don't think they're dropping ""y'alls."""

01:24:24;01:24:26;"There's, like, I'm sure, like, a regional, like,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"redneck-y accent."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"I don't know what it is, but..."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"In Massachusetts?"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"There's conservative rural culture all over the country,"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"like you said, Jake. Upstate New York,"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Connecticut, even New Jersey."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"There's no such thing as a purely blue state"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"the same way there's no such thing as a purely red state."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"And also you can make the case that there's"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"probably a lot of people who identify strongly"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"with all the things he listed"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"who actually don't care about politics at all."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"-I'm sure there's many people who are like, -Oh, of course."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"""Yeah, I'm into pickup trucks, hunting,"

01:25:01;01:25:04;"Who knows? That person presumably exists somewhere."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"But yeah, the question is,"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"even if you're wearing Carhartt and driving a pickup truck,"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"that also could probably be a handful of, uh,"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"hipsters in New York and L.A. and San Francisco."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I could totally picture a dude,"
01:25:17;01:25:20;"head-to-toe Carhartt, ripping around, um,"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Williamsburg with, like, a pickup truck."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"-Just, like, rolling into Fox. -Although the hipster would have"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"like an '80s or '90s, like, small pickup truck."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"They're not gonna be driving, like, an F-250."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"[laughter]"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Fresh off the lot."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"Like an $80,000 pickup."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"It is a good question."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Were there any country artists who heard Northern Redneck"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"and they were just like, ""Yeah, this is cultural appropriation, dude."""
01:25:42;01:25:44;"'Cause wouldn't Northern Redneck be, like,"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"mayor of Easttown?"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Like, it's the Western Mass accent."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"Like, it's actually-- it's its own-- it's not Southern."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Or maybe that's just the weird Borghesean element,"
01:25:53;01:25:57;"that it's like, country music is sung in a Southern accent,"
01:25:57;01:26:00;"so even a Northern country song"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"that's about how-- that Southern people don't have"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"a unique claim to rural conservative identity"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"has to be sung in a Southern accent."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"-Yeah, I mean, even if-- -It's a strange, strange rule."
01:26:11;01:26:14;"Even if the Rolling Stones are doing a country song,"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"Mick will do his-- like, a weird Southern accent."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Like, yeah, on ""Faraway Eyes."""
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Although-- but then you get to this thing, like--"
01:26:21;01:26:25;"I mean, I thought about it with some VW country-leaning songs."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"I was very-- really trying not to go too country,"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"'cause it is-- you know, your voice wants to go there."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"But I mean, when I think about, like, really, you know,"
01:26:33;01:26:36;"like Jerry, for instance, he would do the--"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"the Dead's country material,"
01:26:38;01:26:42;"kind of in his same iconic, unique Northern California Jerry voice."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Yeah, that's true."
01:26:44;01:26:48;"Speaking of Aaron Lewis's number one enemy, Bruce Springsteen,"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"Bruce has always had an interesting thing where he's, like--"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"he does have this, like, all-American accent voice."
01:26:55;01:26:59;"His singing voice has, like, a hint of, like, Southern-ness in it."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"This all-American thing."
01:27:01;01:27:05;"I mean, he's a fascinating dude, too, in terms of, like, place"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"that he obviously so identified with New Jersey."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"But then, like, he did-- he could just make an album"
01:27:11;01:27:17;"called Nebraska and, you know, sing songs about other parts of the country"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"and just, like, went down really easy,"
01:27:19;01:27:24;"where New Jersey is definitely-- is so hyper-specific."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"That's such an East Coast state."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"It's got such a unique reputation and vibe."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"It's not considered, like, an all-American place."
01:27:31;01:27:35;"And yet he-- from New Jersey, he became an all-American dude."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"What's funny is that he probably sings about New Jersey"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"less than a lot of other places,"
01:27:40;01:27:43;"less than, like, the mythical Heartland,"
01:27:43;01:27:46;"whether it's the Nebraska stuff"
01:27:46;01:27:49;"or whether it's the Ghosts of Tom Jode stuff,"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"which is all, like, songs in, like, Fresno and stuff."
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Like, you know, like where The Grapes of Wrath was set."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"But, like, I can't think of that many, like, specific New Jersey songs."
01:27:58;01:28:01;"I mean, maybe some of the stuff on Born to Run, like,"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"he's going across the river to do a favor for a guy."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Or I guess there's Atlantic City. Duh."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"Again, that's the exact type of conversation you could picture him"
01:28:09;01:28:12;"and John Lando having. Like, let's call this album Nebraska."
01:28:12;01:28:17;"They're referencing, like, the movie Badlands,"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"which takes place in the Midwest, which is based on the real people."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"And you can imagine them being like,"
01:28:23;01:28:26;"""Yeah, but you know what, man? We're going to have this song Atlantic City,"""
01:28:26;01:28:28;"which is, like, the closer-to-home version."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"He's like, ""Ooh, I like this. The album's called Nebraska,"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"but then you've got this song that takes place, like, down the Jersey Shore."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"I like how this all comes together as a conceptual framework"
01:28:36;01:28:39;"for a kind of, like, dark album about America."""
01:28:39;01:28:43;"Yeah, it's funny. I think I talked on the show a few years ago"
01:28:43;01:28:48;"about how much I love the Bruce live playing the Tom Waits song,"
01:28:48;01:28:51;"""Jersey Girl,"" which a lot of people assume Bruce wrote"
01:28:51;01:28:54;"because it's about, you know, hanging out with the Jersey Girl."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"But no, Tom Waits wrote it, and Bruce drops that in concert,"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"and of course people go nuts, but he didn't write that song."
01:29:00;01:29:03;"I just had this thought. I've said this on the show before"
01:29:03;01:29:06;"about how I'm always so bemused by the fact that"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"Scarlet Begonias is, as far as I know,"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"the only Grateful Dead song set in Europe."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"It's in the UK."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"Grateful Dead, very all-American band,"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"one song that takes place in England."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"I'm like, ""Are there any Bruce Springsteen songs"
01:29:22;01:29:26;"that take place, like, outside of North America?"""
01:29:26;01:29:29;"I feel like he has some, like, late period, like, Mexico songs"
01:29:29;01:29:32;"that are about, like, drug cartels and stuff."
01:29:32;01:29:35;"Well, definitely, yeah, on ""Ghost of Tom Joad,"""
01:29:35;01:29:37;"there's drug cartel songs."
01:29:37;01:29:40;"But, yeah, that's North America."
01:29:40;01:29:43;"Could you picture, like, a Bruce Springsteen song in, like, France?"
01:29:43;01:29:46;"On, like, the plains of Siberia?"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"[laughs]"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"I don't know. That's a hell of a number crunch."
01:29:50;01:29:54;"""In a crowded marketplace in old Mumbai."""
01:29:54;01:29:57;"Like, just, like..."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"You could apply that to..."

01:30:09;01:30:12;"Well, I guess I could picture, like, a Bruce song about, like,"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"a soldier in Afghanistan, maybe."
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Yeah."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"I think Seinfeld dropped off the call."

01:30:36;01:30:40;"I've been trying to find... Yeah, I do think that..."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Well, if the listeners know."
01:30:41;01:30:45;"Maybe there's a listener who's super familiar with the last, like,"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"five albums, which I'm not that familiar with."
01:30:48;01:30:53;"Well, and also, you know, Bruce is famously half Irish, half Italian."
01:30:53;01:30:56;"A very classic East Coast combo."
01:30:56;01:30:59;"And, I mean, I'm sure he's, like, a very..."
01:30:59;01:31:02;"He's a guy who's really interested in history."
01:31:02;01:31:05;"Very intelligent, sensitive man."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"I'm sure he probably was..."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"Has probably traveled through Italy and Ireland,"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"interested in, like, where his family came from."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Like, he seems like that type of dude."
01:31:14;01:31:17;"But, like, did he ever write a song about it?"
01:31:17;01:31:21;"Yeah, I could see, like, a late period song about, like,"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"his great-grandfather riding a boat over from Ireland."
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Right."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Going through, like, Ellis Island or something."
01:31:26;01:31:27;"I could totally see that."
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Maybe he set some rules for himself, where he's like,"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"it's all got to take..."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Yeah, but even that song, like, takes place just, like,"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"20 miles out from the shores of the US."
01:31:36;01:31:39;"No longer international waters."
01:31:39;01:31:45;"I found these covered when I leave Berlin live."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"What's that song?"
01:31:46;01:31:52;"Let's put... It's a song by Wiz Jones."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"Not familiar?"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Not familiar."
01:31:55;01:32:00;"But, yeah, I think that that's the closest that seems like a song that..."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"Because it is. It's very funny."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"It's like you can't even hear..."
01:32:02;01:32:06;"You know, unlike, like, Paul Simon or Dylan, you know,"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"or someone who you just, you know,"
01:32:08;01:32:13;"European or Middle Eastern places sort of roll off the tongue."
01:32:13;01:32:17;"Even the idea of him saying, like, ""Bombay."""
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Right."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"It just doesn't feel right."
01:32:20;01:32:21;"I just can't imagine."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"""Beirut, where you gotta..."""
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"I'd love to hear it."
01:32:27;01:32:32;"I'd love to hear Bruce turning his pen towards another part of the world."
01:32:32;01:32:35;"But at the same time, maybe he, like,"
01:32:35;01:32:39;"he's found so many dimensions to sing about the, you know,"
01:32:39;01:32:43;"the state of affairs in the US, like, decades in."
01:32:43;01:32:46;"He still finds new ways to kind of explore that territory."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"So I bet somebody knows something."
01:32:48;01:32:51;"So if you know any Bruce songs or even a moment in a song"
01:32:51;01:32:56;"that's clearly set outside North America, please let us know."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"All right. Should we do the top five?"
01:32:58;01:33:05;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:33:05;01:33:09;"Am I the only one?"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"Winning to fight?"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"Thank you, Pete."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"How about on the next Mountain Bruce EP, you just do, like, a rewrite"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"that more suits your sensibility, Jake?"
01:33:16;01:33:20;"Yeah. Am I the only one?"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I'm not willing to fight."
01:33:23;01:33:27;"It's just, am I the only one chillin' tonight?"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Oh, I like that."
01:33:28;01:33:32;"Could care less about the red and white and the blue."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"No, that's not true."
01:33:33;01:33:36;"I mean, I do care about the red, white, and blue, but..."
01:33:36;01:33:39;"I mean, it could be, like, isn't, like, a Budweiser can have red,"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"red, white, and blue on it?"
01:33:40;01:33:43;"That's a tight call."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Another Bud's going down."
01:33:45;01:33:49;"How about a song where you're at a Fourth of July barbecue"
01:33:49;01:33:53;"with a lot of Stained and Aaron Lewis fans, and then people are like,"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"""Oh, hell yeah. You know what we're blasting at this barbecue?"
01:33:56;01:33:57;"Am I the only one?"""
01:33:57;01:33:58;"On repeat."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"That's what Aaron wants us to do. On repeat."
01:34:00;01:34:04;"But then you're the only kind of, like, apolitical or, like,"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"non-MAGA person there, and you're kind of like,"
01:34:06;01:34:13;"""Am I the only one who prefers the early material?"""
01:34:13;01:34:17;"Just like, ""Am I the only one who kind of, like,"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"was a little more into it before, like, Aaron got super political"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"with MAGA hat and s***?"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"Am I the only one who respects the song craft"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"but doesn't really like the political message?"""
01:34:27;01:34:29;"""Am I the only one that prefers Northern Redneck?"""
01:34:29;01:34:34;"And let's face it, it's '70s tasteful palate exploration"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"that he went into there."
01:34:35;01:34:41;"I mean, ""Am I the only one that's missing the pedal steel on this song?"""
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Exactly. ""Am I the only one who doesn't give a s***"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"about the statues coming down?"" Like, come on."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"All right, let's get in the top five."
01:34:48;01:34:55;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:34:55;01:35:01;"We got the top five songs on the iTunes chart right now."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"So, you know, you might notice some different flavors in here."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"It's going to be a little bit different."
01:35:05;01:35:10;"The number five song, already we're in a different universe."
01:35:10;01:35:13;"The song is called ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"""
01:35:13;01:35:16;"but the artist is not Nirvana."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"This is Malia J."
01:35:18;01:35:21;"Malia J is a Hawaiian-born singer who has recorded covers"
01:35:21;01:35:24;"for a bunch of film and TV shows,"
01:35:24;01:35:28;"and this is in the opening credits of the Marvel film ""Black Widow."""
01:35:28;01:35:31;"Maybe she's living in her tomorrow."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"Or yesterday, sorry."
01:35:33;01:35:38;"Maybe she's in a world where no one's ever made"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"""
01:35:41;01:35:44;"and she went and pitched it to the MCU,"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"and it's like, ""Oh, my God."""
01:35:47;01:35:49;"This song rules."
01:35:49;01:35:52;"Load up on guns"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"And bring your friends"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"It's fun to lose"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"And to pretend"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"I mean, I can't believe we got a real yesterday moment."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"This is good."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Right, it's perfect."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"And selfish"
01:36:06;01:36:09;"Oh, no, I know"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"A dirty word"
01:36:12;01:36:18;"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
01:36:18;01:36:22;"Hello, hello, hello"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"With the lights out"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"It's less dangerous"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"Here we are now"
01:36:31;01:36:34;"Entertain us"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I feel stupid"
01:36:36;01:36:40;"You're not meant to hear the lyrics to this song quite so clearly."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"You know what I mean? You just want to hear, like, Kurt."
01:36:43;01:36:47;"Yeah, I wonder what-- how this ties in, if at all,"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"thematically, to what's happening in the movie."
01:36:49;01:36:54;"It's like-- is it just supposed to be, like, a melodramatic song?"
01:36:54;01:36:58;"I'm sure that's, like, Black Widow, like, flying through, like, glass,"
01:36:58;01:37:01;"and, like, coming up behind dudes and, like, slitting their necks"
01:37:01;01:37:05;"and just, like, slow motion sh*t."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Marvel Studios."
01:37:07;01:37:11;"I mean, it could have been tight if they just made an original song"
01:37:11;01:37:15;"that interpolated or just sampled the ""hello"" part."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"'Cause that's the real--"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"I mean, I'm--"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"That's the real dramatic part of this."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"She's a good singer, but it's, like, yeah, clearly this is, like--"
01:37:23;01:37:28;"It is just kind of funny, just like that kind of stock action movie score."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."
01:37:30;01:37:35;"The strings just sounds like from a sample pack that's just, like,"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"epic movie sounds."
01:37:37;01:37:52;"All right, I've heard enough."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"All right, good enough."
01:37:53;01:37:57;"I guess Malia J, according to our notes,"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"she does a lot of these covers."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"Like, for ""Handmaid's Tale,"" she did ""Buffalo Springfield"""
01:38:02;01:38:04;"for ""What It's Worth."""
01:38:04;01:38:06;"For ""Night Stalker,"" ""The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"""
01:38:06;01:38:08;"she did ""Bananorama,"" ""Cruel Summer."""
01:38:08;01:38:11;"For ""Riverdale,"" she did ""Tears for Fears, Shout."""
01:38:11;01:38:13;"So I guess it's, like, a thing."
01:38:13;01:38:17;"Okay, the number four song right now on the iTunes chart,"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"the Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber, ""Stay."""
01:38:26;01:38:27;"I'm liking this."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Yeah, it's off to a good start."
01:38:29;01:38:35;"Guys, Bruce Springsteen's ""Galveston Bay"""
01:38:35;01:38:37;"takes place in Vietnam."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"But it still has an American name."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Oh, yeah, Vietnam."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"Right, Bruce has moments in Vietnam."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"Totally."
01:38:43;01:38:50;"Okay."

01:39:45;01:39:48;"Talking about how Jesus is cool."
01:39:48;01:39:51;"Yeah, classic story."
01:39:51;01:39:56;"I now associate Nick with Bieber."

01:40:02;01:40:04;"Top five life moment."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"All right."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Fun song."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"We gotta get to number three real quick because"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"this is somebody, truly a legend,"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"one of the biggest artists of our era,"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"who's been gone for a while and came back."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"Jake, do you know who I'm talking about?"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"A major, major artist."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"He's been laying low for a couple years."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Like pop?"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"You could say he often works in a pop idiom."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"But he definitely knows his way around rock music."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"Is he over 40?"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"No, he's not over 40."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"Ed Sheeran?"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Ed Sheeran's back."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"And for a guy like Ed Sheeran to go however long he went"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"a couple years without music is pretty deep."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"This is his new single, Bad Habits."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"It's already tearing up the charts."
01:40:48;01:40:50;"Peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100."
01:40:50;01:40:52;"Number one in the UK."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"His 10th number one single in the UK, by the way."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Shout out to Ed."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Shout out to Ed."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Here's Hey Dude."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Let's check it out."
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Here's Ed Sheeran with Hey Dude."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"One, two, three."
01:41:12;01:41:17;"Every time you come around, you know I can't say no"
01:41:17;01:41:25;"Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control"
01:41:25;01:41:32;"I can feel the paradise before my world implodes"
01:41:32;01:41:40;"And tonight had something wonderful"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"My bad habits lead to late nights"
01:41:43;01:41:47;"Ending alone, conversations with a stranger"
01:41:47;01:41:48;"I barely know"
01:41:48;01:41:51;"He wanted the song to surprise people, he said."
01:41:51;01:41:54;"People think of him as the acoustic singer-songwriter"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"who does ballads."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"But he wanted to drop a mad tune."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"This is one of the mad tunes he made."
01:42:00;01:42:03;"You know, I think he said this thing a second ago"
01:42:03;01:42:06;"about just like a post-weekend sound."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Yeah, this guy had a post-weekend too."
01:42:08;01:42:11;"I think that I hadn't really put it all together,"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"but I think that that's it."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Like, I think there's a lot of this going on."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"It's interesting he's doing it now."
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Yeah."
01:42:18;01:42:21;"My bad habits lead to you"
01:42:21;01:42:29;"My bad habits lead to you"
01:42:29;01:42:32;"Every pure intention ends"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Yeah, it's a weekend mood."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"It's like 80s pop weekend vibe."
01:42:36;01:42:39;"Falling over everything"
01:42:39;01:42:42;"To reach the first time spark"
01:42:42;01:42:47;"Started on a neon light"
01:42:47;01:42:50;"And then it all got dark"
01:42:50;01:42:58;"I only know how to go too far"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"My bad habits lead to late nights"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"Ending alone, conversations with a stranger"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"I barely know, swearing this will be the last"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"But it probably won't"
01:43:10;01:43:13;"I got nothing left to lose or use"
01:43:13;01:43:16;"Oh, do my bad habits lead to white eyes"
01:43:16;01:43:19;"Staring at space and I know I lose control"
01:43:19;01:43:22;"I would love to hear a version of this without that"
01:43:22;01:43:25;"like really stiff EDM beat."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"That's what takes me out of it."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"I kind of like the verses before the drums drop."
01:43:29;01:43:32;"Yeah, it's not bad."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"It doesn't have the..."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"I mean, this is first listen, it's hard to say."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Yeah."
01:43:38;01:43:40;"Just that ""doot, doot, doot"""
01:43:40;01:43:41;"I'm just like, ""Ugh."""
01:43:41;01:43:43;"It takes me out of it."
01:43:43;01:43:51;"We took a long way round"
01:43:51;01:43:58;"Burned 'til the fun runs out"
01:43:58;01:44:01;"My bad habits lead to late nights"
01:44:01;01:44:06;"Ending alone, conversations with a stranger"
01:44:06;01:44:09;"I barely know, swearing this will be the last"
01:44:09;01:44:12;"But it probably won't"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"I got nothing left to lose or use"
01:44:15;01:44:18;"I barely know, swearing this will be the last"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"But it probably won't"
01:44:20;01:44:23;"I got nothing left to lose or use"
01:44:23;01:44:26;"I barely know, swearing this will be the last"
01:44:26;01:44:29;"But it probably won't"
01:44:29;01:44:32;"I'm still with a drummer, but just not that EDM beat."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"I don't want to hear just like a stripped down"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"just voice and acoustic either."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"You would like him to send you the stems?"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"I have very specific needs."
01:44:39;01:44:42;"You want him to send you the stems and you'll remix it?"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Essentially, yeah."
01:44:44;01:44:46;"Program some different drums."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Just real quick, I want to understand"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"what this song's all about."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Because the beginning says,"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"""Every time you come around, you know I can't say no."
01:44:52;01:44:55;"Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"I can feel the paradise before my world implodes."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"And tonight had something wonderful."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone."
01:45:02;01:45:05;"Conversations with a stranger I barely know."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won't."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"I got nothing left to lose or use or do."""
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Is this about like cheating?"
01:45:11;01:45:15;"I was going to say, is it about like drinking or drugs?"
01:45:15;01:45:19;"Oh, the bad habits are like addiction and ending up with..."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Just partying too hard."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Because he loses control or, you know."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"Or is it like, there's something interesting about this."
01:45:26;01:45:29;"""My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone."""
01:45:29;01:45:32;"So that kind of sounds like, just like the person"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"who's just like, doesn't want the party to end,"
01:45:34;01:45:37;"but also is like, by the end it's like,"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"birds are chirping, sun's out, everybody's like,"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"everybody's asleep and just like,"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"""Oh, am I really the only one who's going to just like,"
01:45:44;01:45:45;"crush another beer?"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"All right, I guess I'm the only one who likes to party."""
01:45:47;01:45:48;"""Am I the only one?"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Am I the only one crushing a brew?"
01:45:50;01:45:54;"Sun's coming up, what about you?"""
01:45:54;01:45:58;"But he says, ""My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone."""
01:45:58;01:46:02;"And then says, ""Conversations with a stranger I barely know."""
01:46:02;01:46:05;"So my interpretation of that is almost like,"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"it's not even like this is like some person"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"who's just like, living life too hard,"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"is like, cheating or like, you know,"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"having a series of like, meaningless one night stands"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"and, you know, abusing alcohol or whatever."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"This almost sounds like somebody who just like,"
01:46:21;01:46:24;"parties too hard, ends up having some kind of like,"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"lightweight conversations with people they don't even know."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"And then just like, yeah, this is just like,"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"kind of like a sad, dark story."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"Just like, getting sh*t faced by yourself at the bar,"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"rolling up to the bar to some people you don't even know,"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"just being like, ""Oh, what's up guys?"""
01:46:36;01:46:39;"And they're just like, ""Yeah, um, not much."""
01:46:39;01:46:42;"And you're like, ""All right, I'm going to keep partying at my place."""
01:46:42;01:46:44;"And then everybody's like, ""Cool."""
01:46:44;01:46:45;"And then you end up alone."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"That's kind of what it sounds like, it's sad."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Yeah, yeah. I think he's hammered."
01:46:49;01:46:52;"I think he's like, outside the bar at like, 3 in the morning,"
01:46:52;01:46:56;"drunk, maybe a little coked up, maybe trying to bum a cigarette."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"And just like, getting into some just innocuous conversations with people."
01:47:01;01:47:06;"""Hey man, you listen to Aaron Lewis? No? Or you're missing out?"""
01:47:06;01:47:09;"""You probably listen to f*cking Bruce Springsteen or something."""
01:47:09;01:47:11;"""Um, anyway, just like, wanting to know the next person."""
01:47:11;01:47:13;"He does say, ""My bad habits lead to you,"""
01:47:13;01:47:16;"but there's not much of like, a ""you"" in this song."
01:47:16;01:47:19;"Well, maybe the ""you"" is booze."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"Right."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"I like the song a little more now."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Yeah. One day we should really go deep on Ed Sheeran,"
01:47:24;01:47:28;"because I do feel like there's a lot we probably don't know."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"I mean, we just did like, a whole episode on Aaron Lewis and Stain,"
01:47:31;01:47:35;"so maybe next time we do like, honestly,"
01:47:35;01:47:41;"we pick half a dozen Ed Sheeran songs and really go to town."
01:47:41;01:47:47;"I haven't seen the video, but I know he dresses up like the Joker in it."
01:47:47;01:47:51;"Because I saw people talking about that he was entering his Joker phase."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"Oh my god. Talk about play out."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"I'm into that."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Oh Christ. Really?"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"I'm into it. I don't know why. I'm into it."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"That's cool."
01:47:59;01:48:02;"I think you also just got to keep in mind that like,"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Ed Sheeran is like, such a thing."
01:48:04;01:48:06;"You know, he's such a massive star."
01:48:06;01:48:10;"So many hits. People have so many feelings about him,"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"because they either think of him like he said,"
01:48:12;01:48:15;"""Oh, he's the acoustic guitar guy,"" or whatever."
01:48:15;01:48:21;"That for him to like, get Joker-fied is, I don't know,"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"it's like, interesting to me."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"He's real wholesome."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"He's wholesome and also he's like,"
01:48:26;01:48:31;"even if the Joker movie is like, a few years too late,"
01:48:31;01:48:36;"I think Ed Sheeran is such a massive center of gravity as a cultural figure,"
01:48:36;01:48:39;"that he's allowed to like, come to it a little bit later."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"He can suck it into his orbit, you know?"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"I give him..."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"This is also me not having seen the video."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Just when somebody told me, you know,"
01:48:45;01:48:48;"Ed Sheeran dresses up like the Joker in his new video,"
01:48:48;01:48:49;"I was just like, ""That rules."""
01:48:49;01:48:52;"Also, I just like the idea of Ed Sheeran just like,"
01:48:52;01:48:56;"sitting there and being like, two years after that movie came out,"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"just being like, ""I want to dress like the f***ing Joker in my video."""
01:48:58;01:49:00;"Almost because it's a little played out,"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"I almost give him more credit for it."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Maybe I'll whistle a different tune when I see the video."
01:49:04;01:49:08;"I mean, that's a very generous read. I love it."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"This is a kind vibe show, folks."
01:49:10;01:49:13;"Ezra's going to give it a generous read."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"But look, I'm not going to name them,"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"but there's a lot of artists that if they did go Joker mode,"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"I would be like, ""That's so played out."""
01:49:21;01:49:23;"I'm just saying, I give..."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"What if Eminem went Joker mode?"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"That wouldn't work for me."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Like, old-ass Eminem."
01:49:29;01:49:33;"Like, 48-year-old Eminem with like..."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Ed Sheeran going Joker mode, I'm intrigued for it."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"Okay, how about this? Harry Styles goes Joker mode."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"- Are you in? - Harry Styles goes Joker mode."
01:49:40;01:49:44;"I'm less in. I respect him, but I'm less in"
01:49:44;01:49:48;"because I'd be like, ""What is that supposed to mean?"""
01:49:48;01:49:51;"Like, Ed Sheeran announcing to the world,"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"""I'm going into my Joker phase,"""
01:49:53;01:49:57;"is surprising, intriguing, tantalizing."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"Harry Styles going Joker mode would be a little like,"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"""Yeah, what's the point?"""
01:50:02;01:50:04;"I think there's a reason Harry Styles didn't go Joker mode."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"- It wouldn't suit him. - Bieber."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"Bieber, I wouldn't respect it."
01:50:08;01:50:11;"He'd just be like, ""Dude, you're confused. What are you doing?"""
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Yeah, Ed Sheeran going Joker mode."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"I guess I'm also giving him credit that it's purposeful."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"I'm starting to see what you're saying now."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"He's one of the few that can pull it off."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"- I guess if... - Pull it off!"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"You know what I mean? If Phil Collins went Joker mode,"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"- you'd respect it, right? - Now? Yeah."
01:50:28;01:50:33;"Like a 70-year-old Phil Collins."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Putting on a new record."
01:50:35;01:50:39;"It's Phil Collins' first record of new music in 22 years,"
01:50:39;01:50:43;"and he's coming out Joker mode."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"No, but Phil Collins in '87 going Joker mode,"
01:50:46;01:50:49;"that would be before the Batman craze."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"- Would be sick. - Mm-hmm."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"The number two song, I'm gonna pick up the pace."
01:50:54;01:50:58;"Our old friends BTS built a spill,"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"soul edition,"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"with new song, Permission to Dance."
01:51:03;01:51:06;"- That's a funny title. - Lovely title."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"It's the thought of being young"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Oh, it's written by Ed Sheeran."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"- Co-written with Ed Sheeran. - Yeah, yeah."
01:51:13;01:51:16;"When it all seems like a swamp"
01:51:16;01:51:18;"Sing along to Elton John"
01:51:18;01:51:21;"Until that feeling we're just getting started"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"When the nights get colder"
01:51:24;01:51:28;"And the rhythm's got you falling behind"
01:51:28;01:51:32;"Just dream about that moment"
01:51:32;01:51:36;"When you look yourself right in the eye"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"I wanna dance to music"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"- I'm feeling this. - Yeah, this is fun."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Good chorus."
01:51:44;01:51:47;"Let's break our plans and inches"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Like we're golden and roaring"
01:51:49;01:51:52;"Like we're dancing fools"
01:51:52;01:51:55;"We don't need to worry"
01:51:55;01:51:59;"'Cause when we go, we know how to dance"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Don't need to talk the talk"
01:52:01;01:52:05;"Just walk the walk tonight"
01:52:05;01:52:08;"'Cause we don't need permission to dance"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"- I'm way into this. - This is the first BTS"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"that's really excited me."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"I think that's maybe because of Mr. Ed Sheeran."
01:52:15;01:52:18;"That right vibe, yeah 'Cause there's no looking back"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"There ain't no one to prove"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"We don't got this on lock, yeah"
01:52:22;01:52:25;"This is an interesting event upcoming."
01:52:25;01:52:29;"Global Citizen Live, a 24-hour special"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"that will be broadcast live from six continents"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"on September 26."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"Ed Sheeran, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish,"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"Metallica, and Green Day"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"are just a few of the other performers."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"God bless Metallica and Green Day."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Still slugging it out."
01:52:47;01:52:50;"I love, like, BTS and Metallica"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"like sharing a bill."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"That's really funny."
01:52:54;01:52:57;"It's interesting in that"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"who's turning up just for Metallica"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"and then enjoying the rest of the music?"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"- Well-- - This sounds so bad."
01:53:05;01:53:08;"It's a 24-hour special broadcast from six continents"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"so I bet Metallica'll probably just do a Metallica show somewhere"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"and they'll just, like, cut in."

01:56:20;01:56:21;"You know what's cool?"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"On TikTok, like, a song can go viral"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"just from, like, the briefest moment,"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"you know, totally out of context."
01:56:28;01:56:32;"This is the entire chorus is what went viral."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"Oh, the whole chorus?"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"It's the whole dance."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"It's a dance to the entire from ""Apple Bees"" on,"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"you know, through the frosted shake."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"So it's like actually appreciation for the music."
01:56:43;01:56:46;"Is he drinking Natty light out of a styrofoam cup?"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"I guess so."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"Is that what's happening?"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"Boujee like that."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"And this is kind of a classic country trope"
01:56:51;01:56:56;"where you kind of contrast concepts like fanciness"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"with whatever you do."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Yeah."
01:56:59;01:57:00;"I talk about this song a lot."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"My dad always played this country duet called"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"""We're Not the Jet Set, We're the Old Chevrolet Set."""
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Uh-huh."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"That song opens with whoever it is."
01:57:09;01:57:12;"I forget if it's the Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"or something like that,"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"but they're singing to each other's thing"
01:57:15;01:57:18;"about how they fell in love in Paris"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"and they kissed by a fountain in Rome"
01:57:21;01:57:24;"and they had this magical night in Athens."
01:57:24;01:57:27;"It has this kind of like real European opening,"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"like romantic vibe."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"And then suddenly he goes,"
01:57:33;01:57:38;"""Rome, Georgia, Paris, Texas, and Athens, Tennessee."""
01:57:38;01:57:40;"And then it like kicks in where they're like,"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"""Oh, you thought we were talking about Europe."""
01:57:42;01:57:43;"That's kind of like the Bruce Springsteen role."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"No Europe."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"""You thought we were talking about Europe?"""
01:57:46;01:57:47;"No."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"And then they go, ""We're not the jet set,"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"we're the old Chevrolet set."""
01:57:51;01:57:54;"And then the whole thing is about like they got love"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"and they don't need all that fancy [bleep]"
01:57:56;01:57:57;"and here he's saying,"
01:57:57;01:58:00;"""Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night,"
01:58:00;01:58:03;"got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake,"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"and then we're bougie like Natty in the styrofoam."""
01:58:06;01:58:10;"Well, the funny thing is it's not like Applebee's is like dirt cheap."
01:58:10;01:58:14;"He's not saying like we're fancy like Dollar Tree."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Two people getting like [bleep] faced on Applebee's"
01:58:16;01:58:17;"on a date night?"
01:58:17;01:58:18;"No, I think that's the point he's making."
01:58:18;01:58:19;"I think they're like--"
01:58:19;01:58:22;"But then he says, ""We're bougie like Natty in the styrofoam."""
01:58:22;01:58:23;"There's nothing--"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"Right, which--"
01:58:24;01:58:25;"That's not actually bougie."
01:58:25;01:58:26;"Hunter thinks that's bougie."
01:58:26;01:58:31;"I interpreted it as like Applebee's was like they're not fancy"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"and so like a big date night is going to Applebee's"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"and getting the Oreo shake with the steak,"
01:58:36;01:58:40;"which is also an insane thing to do as an adult male."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"It's 2,000 calories."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"The shake is or the steak?"
01:58:44;01:58:49;"The shake is 1,100 calories and the steak is 800 calories."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"I mean--"
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Well, then you get the food, you get fries."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"I mean that's--"
01:58:52;01:58:55;"And then fries and beers."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"Also, it's funny, I got that Bourbon Street Steak"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"with Oreo shake, get some whipped cream on the top too,"
01:59:00;01:59:04;"and then the ad lib is, ""Got to add that whipped cream."""
01:59:04;01:59:08;"A real working familiarity with the Applebee's menu."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"Yeah, I guess there is something a tiny bit confusing about it"
01:59:10;01:59:14;"because for many people in America,"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"it would be fancy to go to Applebee's"
01:59:16;01:59:19;"because honestly this dinner sounds like it's going to--"
01:59:19;01:59:22;"For two people, I'm seeing the bill,"
01:59:22;01:59:25;"especially if you give a decent tip,"
01:59:25;01:59:28;"I think we're getting up to 80, 90 bucks, right?"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"Yeah, I mean what's that Bourbon Street Steak"
01:59:30;01:59:31;"at Applebee's run?"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"I'm going to guess like 18.99."
01:59:33;01:59:35;"Can I get a number crunch, Nick?"
01:59:35;01:59:38;"The Oreo shake is going to run you like seven."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"Yeah, and then--"
01:59:39;01:59:42;"It might be closer to like 70 bucks, but yeah, it's not--"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"No, but then two or three drinks each?"
01:59:44;01:59:47;"Like alcoholic drinks and fries?"
01:59:47;01:59:50;"I like the combination of like beers and a milkshake"
01:59:50;01:59:53;"at the same time."
01:59:53;01:59:56;"No, but Applebee's is a full bar, man."
01:59:56;01:59:57;"They might be--"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"$17."
01:59:59;02:00:00;"For the Bourbon Street Steak?"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"For the Bourbon Street Steak."
02:00:02;02:00:03;"I nailed that."
02:00:03;02:00:04;"No pun intended, well done."
02:00:04;02:00:06;"But you're getting some sides too, man."
02:00:06;02:00:08;"You're getting the like jalapeno poppers."
02:00:08;02:00:11;"No, I think actually this dinner is going to 100 easy."
02:00:11;02:00:13;"Yeah, if you're drinking booze, definitely."
02:00:13;02:00:14;"It's date night."
02:00:14;02:00:17;"Maybe you're dumping a little whiskey into that shake."
02:00:17;02:00:18;"Oh, yeah."
02:00:18;02:00:22;"No, but at Applebee's, you could straight up be pounding like--"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"just--"
02:00:23;02:00:27;"you have vodkas, vodka on the rocks with all this sh*t."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"It's getting sloppy."
02:00:28;02:00:32;"Also, we should point out that the pre-chorus is about--"
02:00:32;02:00:35;"he basically is doing some classic country sh*t"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"that we don't need no champagne, pop, and entertainment."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"I can take her to Wendy's."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"Can't keep her off me."
02:00:40;02:00:43;"She want to dip me like them fries in her Frosty."
02:00:43;02:00:46;"So he's saying like we're not fancy."
02:00:46;02:00:49;"And then he says in another verse, he says,"
02:00:49;02:00:51;"""I don't need no Tesla to impress her."
02:00:51;02:00:54;"My girl's happy rolling on a Vespa."""
02:00:54;02:00:55;"All right, that's weird."
02:00:55;02:00:59;"Is that-- like a Vespa is kind of chic in its own way."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"Anyway, we don't need no mansion to get to romance."
02:01:01;02:01:03;"And again, classic country sh*t."
02:01:03;02:01:04;"We're not fancy people."
02:01:04;02:01:08;"And then he says, ""Our version of fancy is Applebee's on a date night."""
02:01:08;02:01:09;"That makes total sense."
02:01:09;02:01:13;"For most people, $100 date night--"
02:01:13;02:01:16;"I mean, literally for like 95% of the country,"
02:01:16;02:01:18;"that's like a lot of money to spend on dinner."
02:01:18;02:01:19;"So yes, that is fancy."
02:01:19;02:01:22;"But then he says, ""We're bougie like Natty and the Styrofoam."""
02:01:22;02:01:24;"I guess now he's just being silly."
02:01:24;02:01:25;"Yeah."
02:01:25;02:01:28;"Because for many people, $100 date night is fancy."
02:01:28;02:01:29;"I would say most people."
02:01:29;02:01:31;"But nobody thinks that Natty and the Styrofoam is--"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"so whatever."
02:01:32;02:01:35;"He's a little all over the place, but we get the point."
02:01:35;02:01:38;"And then he says, ""Some Alabama jam, she my Dixieland delight."""
02:01:38;02:01:41;"I love that he named the album ""Country Stuff."""
02:01:41;02:01:44;"Because he's just like, ""Yeah, it's some country stuff."
02:01:44;02:01:47;"I'm just riffing on the tropes of country music."""
02:01:47;02:01:48;"Just some country stuff."
02:01:48;02:01:54;"That title really suggests that it's self-aware and funny"
02:01:54;02:01:57;"as opposed to Aaron Lewis."
02:01:57;02:02:00;"I'm actually the son of hippies from Vermont."
02:02:00;02:02:04;"Normally, I do more of a jam band thing."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"But for this EP, I just called it ""Country Stuff"""
02:02:06;02:02:08;"because I'm just doing country stuff."
02:02:08;02:02:11;"Just listing a series of country tropes"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"that don't really reflect me or my life,"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"but I thought maybe other people would relate to it."
02:02:15;02:02:17;"Well, good for you, Walker Hayes."
02:02:17;02:02:19;"I'm a huge Ween fan."
02:02:19;02:02:21;"[laughter]"
02:02:21;02:02:24;"And I guess also the song went viral on TikTok"
02:02:24;02:02:27;"because Walker Hayes posted a video"
02:02:27;02:02:31;"dancing with his whole family-- his wife and his daughter."
02:02:31;02:02:33;"So that's kind of, I guess, a feel-good story."
02:02:33;02:02:34;"I love it."
02:02:34;02:02:36;"The title of this episode is ""Country Stuff."""
02:02:36;02:02:37;"[laughter]"
02:02:37;02:02:42;"We ended real strong with that BTS and the Walker Hayes."
02:02:42;02:02:43;"Oh, yeah, excellent."
02:02:43;02:02:47;"I think we stick with the iTunes for a while."
02:02:47;02:02:48;"Yeah, yeah, I like where this is taking us."
02:02:48;02:02:49;"For the top five."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"Let's keep going down that route."
02:02:51;02:02:54;"All right, Seinfeld just vanished in the middle of this."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"He had to go to a meeting."
02:02:56;02:02:57;"Oh, he had to go to a meeting."
02:02:57;02:02:58;"He's a working man."
02:02:58;02:03:00;"Oh, yeah, he's a working man."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"All right, great seeing everybody."
02:03:02;02:03:04;"We'll be back in two weeks."
02:03:04;02:03:05;"Time crisis."
