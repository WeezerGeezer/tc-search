00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:09;"Rock gods Eddie Vedder and Nicky Sixx are beefing."
00:09;00:14;"Pam and Tommy is taking over television screens everywhere."
00:14;00:20;"Paul Abdul, Trent Reznor, their music stands the test of time."
00:20;00:24;"We'll be talking about all this and more on this week's"
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:29;"Check it!"
00:29;00:34;"Time Crisis"
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave me lonely babe"
01:16;01:20;"Wow Jake, it's pretty amazing that we're both cracking a Corona without discussing"
01:20;01:24;"because I actually have quite a bit of beer in my fridge"
01:24;01:26;"left over from my Super Bowl party."
01:26;01:27;"Right."
01:27;01:30;"So I could have grabbed a Stella, a Modelo"
01:30;01:34;"but I just thought a Corona would go best with the Megabytes."
01:34;01:36;"It's the best looking beer."
01:36;01:39;"Yeah, an attractive bottle."
01:39;01:41;"Alright, let's start the show for real though."
01:41;01:42;"Okay."
01:42;01:47;"Time Crisis, post-Super Bowl, Jake congratulations on the big win."
01:47;01:48;"Thank you."
01:48;01:55;"As a city of Los Angeles resident, I know you felt really proud that the Rams took it home."
01:55;01:57;"I was fired up man."
01:58;02:03;"Plus the hometown musical tribute, Golden Oldies."
02:03;02:04;"I mean that was cool."
02:04;02:05;"Yeah."
02:05;02:10;"Maybe just because a lot of the LA born and raised people I know are music people."
02:10;02:14;"So I felt like, alright, if their team doesn't win,"
02:14;02:19;"at least they got to see some of their musical heroes do a tribute to their hometown."
02:19;02:26;"Yeah, and not to blow up your spot, but I feel like most of the people at your Super Bowl party were there to see the halftime show."
02:26;02:28;"People made that very clear."
02:28;02:31;"It was not a football crazy crowd."
02:31;02:32;"No."
02:32;02:34;"Was there any football fan there?"
02:34;02:35;"There were some football fans."
02:35;02:37;"Anyone glued to the television?"
02:37;02:38;"CT?"
02:38;02:40;"CT came through."
02:40;02:41;"He knows a lot about football."
02:41;02:42;"So does Bale."
02:42;02:43;"Bale was there."
02:43;02:45;"I just think, you know what?"
02:45;02:46;"There were people who liked football."
02:46;02:54;"There was nobody at my Super Bowl party who particularly had an attachment to one of the teams playing."
02:54;02:55;"You know what I mean?"
02:55;02:56;"Yeah."
02:56;02:58;"It was neither a Rams nest nor a Bengals den."
02:58;03:05;"I would wager that 90% of the people there could not name the QB of the Rams."
03:05;03:06;"Including me."
03:06;03:07;"Wait."
03:07;03:11;"Joe Burrow was the Bengals."
03:11;03:13;"Can you name the QB of the Rams?"
03:13;03:14;"No."
03:14;03:19;"I watch the game so seriously and I have no idea who the QB is."
03:19;03:20;"Is it like Brocko?"
03:20;03:21;"No, no, no, Brocko."
03:21;03:23;"It was Matt Stafford."
03:23;03:25;"No, it was Brock Hampton."
03:25;03:27;"All of them?"
03:27;03:28;"No, no."
03:28;03:29;"It's a guy named Brock Hampton."
03:29;03:31;"You don't remember at the University of Oklahoma?"
03:31;03:32;"He was great."
03:32;03:33;"You want to know?"
03:33;03:34;"This reminds me."
03:34;03:41;"I was talking with Ezra about that Odell Beckham getting, this was maybe two weeks ago, when"
03:41;03:43;"he lost all of his money."
03:43;03:44;"Do you know about this, Jake?"
03:44;03:45;"No."
03:45;03:47;"Ezra, you might want to explain."
03:47;03:54;"My understanding is that Odell Beckham Jr. chose to get paid in Bitcoin and on top of"
03:54;03:58;"that he already had a heavily incentivized deal where his base salary was relatively"
03:58;03:59;"low."
03:59;04:04;"Bottom line, due to depreciation of Bitcoin, there are all these articles saying Odell"
04:04;04:10;"Beckham Jr., famous world-class athlete, got paid $35,000 this season."
04:10;04:14;"I don't know if that's true, but people are like, ""Ha ha, you made a big mistake."""
04:14;04:15;"Is he a football player?"
04:15;04:17;"Yeah, he was on the Rams."
04:17;04:18;"Okay."
04:18;04:22;"Well, Bitcoin's only down maybe 50 or 60%."
04:22;04:24;"It's not down that much."
04:24;04:26;"It was a tax thing though, wasn't it?"
04:26;04:28;"It was also a tax thing, but then he won the Super Bowl."
04:28;04:29;"I don't know."
04:29;04:30;"He's already rich."
04:30;04:35;"But the story outside of that was that Ezra and I were talking about it and he's like,"
04:35;04:40;"""God, it seems like $750,000 for one of the best players in the NFL."
04:40;04:41;"That seems so low."""
04:41;04:44;"He goes, ""Let me check in with my football text thread."""
04:44;04:45;"Oh yeah, that's right."
04:45;04:49;"I did like the idea that Ezra is on a football text thread."
04:49;04:50;"That's surprising."
04:50;04:57;"I'm on a football text thread, but it's tough because a lot of the guys in my crew, I mean,"
04:57;05:01;"I've talked about this on the show before, Bayo and CT, that's maybe the one team that"
05:01;05:05;"we all care about is the G-Men, the New York Giants."
05:05;05:11;"Because as everybody knows, New York, we're all from the New York area or the tri-state"
05:11;05:13;"area, but as everybody knows, New York has so many different teams."
05:13;05:18;"So, for instance, CT, he grew up loving the New Jersey Nets."
05:18;05:20;"Then he moves to Brooklyn."
05:20;05:21;"Well, guess what?"
05:21;05:22;"The Nets are coming with you."
05:22;05:25;"He loves the Nets, but I'm more of a Knicks guy."
05:25;05:31;"But whatever, the Giants are our shared interest, but they've had a really rough few years."
05:31;05:32;"Got a new coach coming in."
05:32;05:33;"I'm excited."
05:33;05:34;"Anyway."
05:34;05:37;"Were people there for the commercials as much as the halftime show?"
05:37;05:38;"Yeah, a little bit."
05:38;05:43;"But when Jake came to the party, I tried to make it COVID friendly, so I brought a TV"
05:43;05:45;"outside and there was one inside."
05:45;05:50;"And when Jake came, I explained to him, I was like, ""So listen, if you're comfortable"
05:50;05:55;"going inside, it's cooler, there's air conditioning, and there's a nicer TV."
05:55;05:59;"I got this little one outside, but you get to be outside, but the TV's not as good."""
05:59;06:00;"And Jake said, ""You know what?"
06:00;06:03;"It just doesn't matter because I don't give a shit about the game."""
06:03;06:04;"And I was like, ""All right, man."""
06:04;06:09;"We should have made Jake a special edition Super Bowl t-shirt that says, ""Breaking News."
06:09;06:11;"I don't give a shit about the Super Bowl."""
06:11;06:15;"Jake walks into the coffee shop Monday after Super Bowl Sunday."
06:15;06:16;"""Don't talk to me."""
06:17;06:19;"Give me the rocket and I'ma show you all the ways to be the MVP."
06:19;06:21;"Even if you on the bench, you still can't check me."
06:21;06:22;"See, I was born for this."
06:22;06:24;"I ain't the type to sweat technique."
06:24;06:26;"And I ain't waiting for a cut, you better accept me."
06:26;06:27;"You dig?"
06:27;06:29;"I can hit a ball, I don't get checked."
06:29;06:31;"Take it to the house like I'm trick daddy."
06:31;06:34;"Just skipping through the lane, nigga, ain't badly."
06:34;06:36;"But I'm posed for the camera when it gets flashy."
06:36;06:38;"If you don't know my body, take your vitamins."
06:38;06:41;"Got the bench wired like Natasha Hideman."
06:41;06:43;"Plays to make it, could be conk aspiring."
06:43;06:45;"Next possession point like I'm LaMelo, then I'm firing."
06:45;06:47;"Bam, grab those wild on the man."
06:47;06:50;"Baby, I'm the coach so you know I had a plan."
06:50;06:52;"If you wanna stop, you better have a diagram."
06:52;06:55;"I was number one before the season had began."
06:55;07:00;"Boy, you make me wanna, wanna, boy, you make me wanna, wanna,"
07:00;07:04;"boy, you make me wanna, wanna, let go, let go."
07:04;07:06;"So Jake, you left the party early."
07:06;07:09;"Were you aware that the Rams won on Sunday?"
07:09;07:13;"I heard, uh, fireworks in the neighborhood."
07:13;07:17;"And I heard people cheering in the neighboring houses."
07:17;07:20;"And I deduced, I deduced Rams won."
07:20;07:24;"You had a flicker of a thought, I guess the Rams won."
07:24;07:27;"Then you went back to whatever you were doing."
07:27;07:29;"On to the next."
07:29;07:31;"I think I was making a salad at the time."
07:31;07:33;"What kind of salad, Cobb salad?"
07:33;07:34;"No."
07:34;07:38;"When you make a salad, do you get the sort of pre-packaged greens?"
07:38;07:39;"Or do you--"
07:39;07:41;"It was like a spinach salad."
07:41;07:43;"You know, like in one of those like plastic bins."
07:43;07:44;"What do you mean?"
07:44;07:45;"Exactly."
07:45;07:47;"You're not getting like fresh produce."
07:47;07:48;"Wait, but hold on."
07:48;07:49;"Yeah, let's paint this picture."
07:49;07:51;"So Jake, you're there in the kitchen."
07:51;07:52;"Wait, that's not fresh?"
07:52;07:53;"What do you mean?"
07:53;07:54;"I mean, it's gonna go bad."
07:54;07:56;"No, it's fresh, but you can go to the produce."
07:56;07:59;"You don't have to buy the greens in those pre-packaged sort of plastic things."
07:59;08:03;"Yeah, you can get and put, just put them in like a handful and put them in a plastic bag."
08:03;08:04;"Yeah."
08:04;08:05;"But then it gets all soggy."
08:05;08:10;"I prefer, maybe it's not as environmentally friendly, but I prefer the little plastic bin."
08:10;08:12;"I think it stores the spinach better."
08:12;08:13;"I agree."
08:13;08:14;"I'm not critical."
08:14;08:15;"I do the same."
08:15;08:18;"I was just, as Ezra said, painting a picture."
08:18;08:19;"Okay."
08:19;08:24;"So you're there, you got big plastic tub of spinach greens making a salad."
08:24;08:26;"Like, yeah, I come back from your party."
08:26;08:28;"I just like, I just ate a bunch of pizza and wings."
08:28;08:29;"Yep."
08:29;08:30;"But Hannah hadn't had dinner."
08:30;08:32;"I was like, I'm gonna make like a little salad."
08:32;08:33;"We can just have that."
08:33;08:34;"How's that sound?"
08:34;08:35;"She said, that sounds great."
08:35;08:37;"When you got home, there's still, it's like the last quarter."
08:37;08:38;"Did you turn on the game?"
08:38;08:39;"No."
08:39;08:42;"So you came home, you're making a salad."
08:42;08:46;"You're cutting up the bacon, chopping up the hard boiled eggs."
08:46;08:49;"And then you hear these fireworks and you hear cheering."
08:49;08:51;"Do you like pause for a second?"
08:51;08:54;"There's a little smile across your face and you say, congratulations."
08:54;08:57;"Or you like roll your eyes and you're like, keep it down."
08:57;08:58;"Yeah."
08:58;09:02;"I opened the fridge and I was rummaging around trying to find the parm."
09:02;09:04;"So I could grate a little parm on there."
09:04;09:05;"Yeah."
09:05;09:06;"I just, I could care less."
09:06;09:08;"I felt nothing."
09:08;09:10;"I mean, this is, this is great radio folks."
09:10;09:14;"I made a salad."
09:14;09:15;"I felt nothing."
09:15;09:17;"I was like, oh, the Rams won."
09:17;09:20;"This will be when I said, Hannah, I think the Rams won."
09:20;09:22;"She's like, oh yeah, you're probably right."
09:22;09:24;"And then she like checked the internet and she's like, yeah, you're right."
09:24;09:27;"Jake, based on what I'm seeing on the internet, I think you're spot on."
09:27;09:30;"I'm getting the impression that the Rams won the super bowl."
09:30;09:33;"We'll know for sure tomorrow, but I'm calling it."
09:33;09:37;"Let's do another 10 minutes on this moment of me making a spinach salad"
09:37;09:39;"with the Rams winning."
09:39;09:40;"This is good stuff."
09:40;09:42;"I think it's a beautiful picture."
09:42;09:46;"That could be a, when you do like a really depressing mountain bruise album,"
09:46;09:49;"like the joy division mountain bruise, I was making a salad."
09:49;09:50;"The Rams won."
09:50;09:51;"I felt nothing."
09:51;09:54;"But that could be kind of like a silver juice type song."
09:54;09:58;"A hundred percent, especially with the fireworks going off in the background."
09:58;10:02;"Great in the parm as the fireworks went off."
10:02;10:03;"I felt nothing."
10:03;10:04;"Don't give a."
10:04;10:07;"Rams run."
10:07;10:08;"I felt."
10:08;10:09;"Did you feel anything?"
10:09;10:14;"I felt like it was a win-win because I know a lot of great people from LA"
10:14;10:17;"and I've always weirdly like the Cincinnati Bengals."
10:17;10:24;"I have this very strange memory of being at a venue in Cincinnati on tour,"
10:24;10:29;"kind of like a cool DIY punky art space venue,"
10:29;10:31;"which I think we might've played out with dirty projectors."
10:31;10:33;"I've been there twice."
10:33;10:35;"I think we slept there."
10:35;10:36;"Seinfeld."
10:36;10:40;"Can you just give me a number crunch on a punky DIY Cincinnati art space"
10:40;10:42;"venue places?"
10:42;10:45;"You could Google dirty projector Cincinnati 2005."
10:45;10:46;"Yep."
10:46;10:49;"So in 2005, I played there with Jake and dirty projectors."
10:49;10:53;"And I remember we were just like super roughing it, played the show."
10:53;10:56;"The like 20 people left bust out the sleeping bag,"
10:56;11:00;"sleep on the floor in this funky space."
11:00;11:06;"And then two years later I came back and this time we were on a tour with a"
11:06;11:11;"vampire weekend, yacht and dirty projectors, vampire weekend, first to three."
11:11;11:15;"We were the warmup act and we were back at the same venue."
11:15;11:18;"And I have this weird memory of like sitting around with the members of the"
11:18;11:21;"various bands, maybe cause it was an art space."
11:21;11:26;"There was some paper pencils out and we started drawing Cincinnati Bengals"
11:26;11:30;"related kind of like cartoons."
11:30;11:32;"At least me and CT were, I don't know how this started,"
11:32;11:34;"but there was some talk about the Bengals."
11:34;11:39;"And I remember I drew a picture of Carson Palmer and it was, I don't know."
11:39;11:42;"It was like, we were doing some like fun, like nursery school type thing,"
11:42;11:45;"just sitting around drawing Cincinnati Bengals types things."
11:45;11:47;"I don't know where it went, but anyway,"
11:47;11:50;"I always had this like warm feeling about the Cincinnati Bengals."
11:50;11:52;"And I always thought Cincinnati was a cool town."
11:52;11:54;"So I thought you find out what that venue is called."
11:54;12:00;"Yeah, it was publico gallery and it was actually 2007."
12:00;12:02;"It was August 29th, 2007."
12:02;12:06;"That was when vampire weekend came, but Jake's talking about an earlier show."
12:06;12:08;"That was just a dirty project."
12:08;12:12;"Oh, my bad. You know what? Concertarchives.org doesn't go back that far."
12:12;12:14;"I'll keep digging."
12:14;12:16;"No need to dig. We got it. Publico."
12:16;12:17;"Same venue?"
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:19;"Yeah. Same venue."
12:19;12:20;"Okay, I'm closing this number crunch then."
12:20;12:21;"I'm closing the crunch."
12:21;12:22;"Okay."
12:28;12:41;"I will trudge by astard in the world's revolve."
12:41;12:56;"I will jet spirals round the leaves as they fall, round the leaves as they fall."
12:56;13:13;"I'll turn faster than they in their season."
13:13;13:19;"I'll turn faster, I'll turn faster."
13:19;13:27;"I'll turn faster than the wind revolving."
13:27;13:32;"It changes and I don't trust the axis or the allies."
13:32;13:36;"Yeah, it would have been cool for Cincinnati, you know, for the city of Cincinnati to win."
13:36;13:37;"Cincinnati is a great town."
13:37;13:39;"And also, you know what I remembered?"
13:39;13:41;"Somehow I totally forgot this."
13:41;13:47;"I remembered it the day of the game is that Vampire Weekend has the key to Cincinnati."
13:47;13:49;"So I've got a lot of connections to Cincinnati."
13:49;13:50;"Do tell."
13:50;13:58;"Basically, as I recall, the last time we played Cincinnati was a cool kind of semi open air"
13:58;14:05;"amphitheater, which I remember was sponsored by Skyline Chili, the beloved."
14:05;14:08;"I'm sure we've talked about Skyline Chili on the program."
14:08;14:09;"We definitely have talked Skyline."
14:09;14:10;"Yeah."
14:10;14:13;"Because this venue had, what would you call them?"
14:13;14:16;"Like Jumbotrons, you know, two big screens on either side."
14:16;14:17;"Sure."
14:17;14:19;"Where they were to film the band."
14:19;14:25;"And on the bottom of each screen, it said like Chili Vision or something like Skyline"
14:25;14:26;"Chili."
14:26;14:31;"They had a little outpost at the venue and they sponsored the screens."
14:31;14:35;"So the screens were called like Skyline Vision or Chili Vision."
14:35;14:38;"And I remember after the show, I said, our tour manager, please load up the dressing"
14:38;14:42;"room with lots of Skyline Chili, which is a very unique flavor."
14:42;14:43;"It's like kind of sweet."
14:43;14:45;"I think it has cinnamon in it."
14:45;14:46;"Eat it over spaghetti."
14:46;14:49;"Anyway, I remember eating it after the show."
14:49;14:55;"But at that show, at some point before, somebody said to us, hey, guys, the mayor of Cincinnati"
14:55;14:59;"is going to come to the show and he's going to give you guys the key to the city."
14:59;15:01;"And I mean, what do you say in a situation like that?"
15:01;15:03;"We said, hell yeah, come through."
15:03;15:08;"You think he was a fan or was it word got back to him about the Skyline Chili shout"
15:08;15:09;"out that you were doing?"
15:09;15:11;"I guess you were really doing a shout out."
15:11;15:15;"You were just more of patronizing a local institution."
15:15;15:18;"He couldn't have known that I had a soft spot for Skyline Chili because they always have"
15:18;15:20;"a little outpost there."
15:20;15:21;"I think."
15:21;15:24;"I mean, we only talked to him for like, you know, 10, 15 minutes and we took a picture"
15:24;15:27;"and he gave us a little box with the key."
15:27;15:31;"And the day of the game, I thought, where the fuck is that key?"
15:31;15:32;"I think I had it."
15:32;15:35;"I started texting the other guys who guys where the fuck is the key to Cincinnati?"
15:35;15:37;"And I was like, I thought you had it."
15:37;15:42;"I'm like, oh my God, it's going to kill me if we lost the key to Cincinnati."
15:42;15:44;"We might even be in trouble if we did."
15:44;15:46;"But yeah, he came through and he gave us the key."
15:46;15:48;"And I think it said to Vampire Weekend or something."
15:48;15:50;"And he was there with like his wife."
15:50;15:52;"Could you imagine if you were in trouble?"
15:52;15:54;"Yeah, I might not be able to leave."
15:54;15:59;"What is the situation where the mayor is like, guys, we can't get in."
15:59;16:01;"Who's got it?"
16:01;16:03;"Who's got the extra key?"
16:03;16:05;"Oh, Vampire Weekend."
16:05;16:06;"The gate to the city."
16:06;16:10;"It's like, it's like an ancient Babylon."
16:10;16:14;"The gate to the city has been closed for three years."
16:14;16:17;"Maybe at some point they ask for all the keys back and they, you know, maybe it's just kind"
16:17;16:18;"of like a scam."
16:18;16:21;"You come back to Cincinnati and they're just like, all right, so we need that key back."
16:21;16:22;"You've had it for five years."
16:22;16:23;"And you're like, oh, I lost it."
16:23;16:25;"And they're like, hey, no problem."
16:25;16:27;"That's a $3,500."
16:27;16:30;"It's just a money making scam for the city."
16:30;16:33;"Maybe the mayor is just into music and goes to shows a lot."
16:33;16:35;"And he figures like, I'm the mayor."
16:35;16:39;"I'm rolling to a show with my wife and some of our best couple friends."
16:39;16:42;"While I'm there, why don't I just give a key to the artist?"
16:42;16:45;"I don't know how many keys this dude's given out."
16:45;16:46;"How old was he?"
16:46;16:52;"You know, he, I feel like, no older than fifties, maybe forties."
16:52;16:53;"Oh, you know, it's funny."
16:53;16:57;"I have this memory too, that I was talking to him and we were just making small talk."
16:57;17:02;"And I was like, you know that the screens here are Chili Vision."
17:02;17:04;"Skyline Chili sponsors the venue."
17:04;17:06;"And he was like, oh yeah, that's a beloved place."
17:06;17:10;"But then he said, but my wife, she's from the other Chili family."
17:10;17:11;"And then I talked to his wife."
17:11;17:14;"She's like, yeah, don't talk to me about Skyline Chili."
17:14;17:16;"I'm from the Gold Star Chili family."
17:16;17:17;"I think it was Gold Star."
17:17;17:22;"And then as I started talking to them, I realized there's a big Cincinnati Chili rivalry."
17:22;17:26;"It's like a Montague's Capulets type thing."
17:26;17:28;"And she was like, oh, I'm from the other one."
17:28;17:31;"I'm from the other Cincinnati Chili dynasty."
17:31;17:34;"And I was like, Mrs. Mayor, no disrespect."
17:34;17:35;"And she said, none taken."
17:35;17:37;"I know you're from, you're an out of town or you didn't know."
17:37;17:41;"And I said, yeah, I'm sure your family's Chili is just as good, if not better."
17:41;17:42;"And she said, oh, it is."
17:42;17:43;"It's much better."
17:43;17:48;"I said, all right, I don't want to weigh in and local politics."
17:48;17:52;"You were really skating on thin ice there for a sec."
17:52;17:55;"Yeah, these are the type of situations you can walk into when you're a stranger in a"
17:55;17:57;"strange land."
17:57;18:00;"You think you're making kind of charming small talk and then you say something that really"
18:00;18:02;"actually offends somebody."
18:02;18:07;"But anyway, I remember them being nice and somewhere, I'm going to go do a deep physical"
18:07;18:08;"dive after the show."
18:08;18:10;"I got to find the key to Cincinnati."
18:10;18:15;"But anyway, so, you know, talking about the Super Bowl, imagine you're in my shoes."
18:15;18:20;"I got many of the closest people in my life or old school Angelenos."
18:20;18:21;"I live here."
18:21;18:23;"I feel at home enough."
18:23;18:25;"So I'm not going to be mad if the Rams win."
18:25;18:29;"But then at the same time, I got the key to Cincinnati."
18:29;18:31;"So in a sense, I'm have a deeper connection to Cincinnati."
18:31;18:33;"I felt like honestly, I felt like it was win-win."
18:33;18:37;"I guess after I watched the halftime show, I kind of felt a little bit like, well, L.A."
18:37;18:38;"got that."
18:38;18:43;"They got this halftime show with Dr. Dre and, you know, this L.A. specific kind of"
18:43;18:46;"like weird musical version of their culture."
18:46;18:47;"So they got that."
18:47;18:49;"Let the Bengals have the win."
18:49;18:52;"And I think we're even, Steven."
18:52;18:54;"God had other plans is what it is."
18:54;18:59;"The bell tolls noon on 12th and Vine."
18:59;19:02;"And I still need this overtime."
19:02;19:07;"'Cause I'm over myself, over the hit and run, over the rhyme."
19:07;19:09;"For the millionth time."
19:09;19:12;"For the millionth time."
19:12;19:17;"I park at this spot and stare at the wall."
19:17;19:22;"Try to remember I'm somebody's father."
19:22;19:25;"I walk a mute cross Covington Bridge."
19:25;19:27;"Get lost in my head."
19:27;19:29;"Just looking at it."
19:29;19:32;"Now I'm looking at you."
19:32;19:35;"Through the hole in my sheet."
19:35;19:38;"And I still need this overtime."
19:38;19:43;"'Cause I'm over myself, over the hit and run, over the rhyme."
19:43;19:45;"For the millionth time."
19:45;19:48;"For the millionth time."
19:48;19:52;"Over the spin, over the wood, over the look."
19:52;19:54;"Over the rhyme."
19:54;19:57;"For the millionth time."
19:57;19:59;"You know who else has the key to Cincinnati?"
19:59;20:01;"Your key bros with Jack White."
20:01;20:03;"Oh, Jack White has the key to Cincinnati?"
20:03;20:06;"Jack White was given the key to Cincinnati in 2018."
20:06;20:08;"Probably also at a concert."
20:08;20:09;"Who else? What other musicians?"
20:09;20:10;"Probably the National."
20:10;20:11;"They're from Cincinnati."
20:11;20:13;"They're from Cincinnati?"
20:13;20:16;"Well, they're from-- yeah, I don't think any of them live there."
20:16;20:18;"Which, if I was the mayor of Cincinnati,"
20:18;20:20;"I'd be fine giving it to some out-of-towners."
20:20;20:22;"And somebody said, ""Well, you want to give it to the National?"""
20:22;20:23;"They all grew up in Cincinnati."
20:23;20:25;"I'd say, ""Oh, that's great."
20:25;20:27;"What neighborhood do they live in now?"""
20:27;20:34;"I'd say, ""Oh, well, you know, they're between Brooklyn and Silver Lake, Paris."""
20:34;20:35;"I'd say, ""You know what?"""
20:35;20:37;"Paris."
20:37;20:42;"I'd say, ""You know what? No key. No key for them."""
20:42;20:44;"You know who else has the key to Cincinnati?"
20:44;20:51;"You've got Sir Elton John, Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson,"
20:51;20:55;"and 98 Degrees, Nick and Drew Lachey."
20:55;20:57;"And those are just the musicians."
20:57;20:59;"Probably Carson Palmer has one."
20:59;21:00;"All right."
21:00;21:03;"Do, like, LA and New York even give out keys to the city?"
21:03;21:05;"I don't think so, yeah."
21:05;21:07;"What was the material of the key? Do you remember?"
21:07;21:08;"Was it metal?"
21:08;21:10;"Yeah, it was metal."
21:10;21:13;"So they had it engraved, like a custom engraved--"
21:13;21:17;"Patti Smith has the key to the city of New York."
21:17;21:19;"Or in Manhattan, I would--yeah."
21:19;21:22;"I'm going to find some others, but there certainly are giving keys away."
21:22;21:24;"And she got that this year."
21:24;21:28;"Has the band gotten other awards from cities?"
21:28;21:30;"Who's on your key chain?"
21:30;21:36;"No, I kind of remember way, way back when our song ""Horchata"" came out,"
21:36;21:41;"because ""Horchata"" originally comes from Valencia, Spain."
21:41;21:48;"We got something from the official association of Horchata makers of Valencia."
21:48;21:51;"They sent us maybe a certificate or something."
21:51;21:54;"No, but more or less, unless I'm forgetting something,"
21:54;22:01;"in terms of material objects made of metal, you know, real things,"
22:01;22:06;"Vampire Weekend has an NME award, a Q Award, two Grammys,"
22:06;22:08;"and the key to Cincinnati."
22:08;22:09;"Not bad."
22:09;22:13;"That's basically an indie rock EGOT when you have those four things."
22:13;22:15;"Indie rock EGOT."
22:15;22:19;"Indie rock EGOT is--I don't know if they still do--is an NME award,"
22:19;22:25;"a Q Award, a Grammy, a Best Alternative Album Grammy, specifically,"
22:25;22:27;"and the key to Cincinnati."
22:27;22:29;"Is NME and Q British?"
22:29;22:30;"Yeah, they're British."
22:30;22:33;"I would put a Pitchfork Best Of."
22:33;22:35;"Oh, and a Pitchfork Best Of."
22:35;22:38;"Yeah, but they don't give you a hard object."
22:38;22:39;"You know what?"
22:39;22:40;"Pitchfork should."
22:40;22:44;"If you get a perfect 10, I guess, which they give occasionally, don't they?"
22:44;22:45;"Very rarely."
22:45;22:49;"Yeah, because they might feel like they're giving out best new music"
22:49;22:50;"all the time."
22:50;22:52;"They're going to break the bank."
22:52;22:53;"Yeah, yeah, that's not a big deal."
22:53;22:58;"But to give a perfect 10, yeah, they only do that, what, every few years,"
22:58;22:59;"once a decade?"
22:59;23:01;"What are the lists of perfect 10s?"
23:01;23:02;"Can we just run that?"
23:02;23:07;"While you crunch that number, I just have to say this is the most"
23:07;23:09;"Hollyweird key to the city."
23:09;23:12;"The list of people that have gotten the Hollywood, like, LA key to the cities"
23:12;23:15;"is strange, where you think, oh, Patti Smith makes sense in New York."
23:15;23:22;"In 2006, 27 Victoria's Secret angels were presented with a key to the city."
23:22;23:24;"Okay."
23:24;23:25;"Okay."
23:25;23:27;"They just got one key to share?"
23:27;23:31;"It seems that all 27 were given a key."
23:31;23:36;"In 2009, Zooey Deschanel got one."
23:36;23:38;"This is what's so strange."
23:38;23:43;"I guess in Hollywood, a star on the Walk of Fame is essentially the key to the city."
23:43;23:46;"Yeah, except that I don't think it is."
23:46;23:47;"Don't you pay for that?"
23:47;23:51;"There's something kind of funny and shady about stars on the Walk of Fame."
23:51;23:53;"Yeah, Lil' Kim got one."
23:53;23:55;"She got the key to Los Angeles?"
23:55;23:56;"LA."
23:56;23:58;"Yeah, that's strange."
23:58;24:01;"So they're giving them out very sporadically."
24:01;24:03;"Yes, definitely sporadically."
24:03;24:08;"It must be just someone working in the mayor's office is a huge fan of Zooey Deschanel"
24:08;24:13;"and just, like, pounds the pavement to make that happen."
24:13;24:16;"And then Zooey's like, oh, actually, I can't make it that day."
24:16;24:17;"I'm sorry."
24:17;24:20;"We'd be happy to work around your schedule."
24:20;24:24;"The city is just so freaking proud of you, Ms. Deschanel."
24:51;24:53;"Seinfeld, do you get that perfect ten list?"
24:53;24:59;"Yeah, by my count, Pitchfork has given a perfect ten to a surprisingly high number of albums, actually."
24:59;25:02;"It looks like about 93 albums have been awarded."
25:02;25:03;"What?"
25:03;25:08;"But I think a lot of those are probably, you know, Pitchfork's existed since 1989."
25:08;25:12;"So a lot of those are going to be going back to '89."
25:12;25:13;"No, no."
25:13;25:15;"In fact, they're going much further back."
25:15;25:22;"They're retroactively giving, you know, when they review an album, like they'll give Serge Gainsbourg a perfect ten."
25:22;25:24;"Like an album from the '70s?"
25:24;25:26;"Yeah, the White Album has a perfect ten."
25:26;25:28;"The White Album has a perfect ten."
25:28;25:29;"Yeah."
25:29;25:30;"More recently--"
25:30;25:31;"No, no, that's--"
25:31;25:32;"Is that the only Beatles record?"
25:32;25:35;"When they give the White Album a perfect ten, they're not going back."
25:35;25:38;"But it is correct to say that it wasn't online then."
25:38;25:40;"Because I think the White Album came out in 1968."
25:40;25:47;"As far as I know, the internet was only a few hundred people at the time, or a few thousand people."
25:47;25:50;"Primarily, it was people who worked at the government or universities."
25:50;25:54;"In 1968, Joe Schmo did not have access to the internet."
25:54;25:57;"And probably your average rock critic didn't have access to the internet."
25:57;26:02;"Even a wealthy rock musician like a John Lennon or a Paul McCartney didn't have access to the internet."
26:02;26:06;"So I think Pitchfork was a print edition then, with very limited reach."
26:06;26:10;"It was kind of a precursor to what eventually became known as Zines."
26:10;26:12;"It only came out twice a year."
26:12;26:14;"But yeah, the White Album got a perfect ten."
26:14;26:16;"See, I heard differently about the origins of Pitchfork."
26:16;26:20;"I heard that Pitchfork was originally a CIA op."
26:20;26:24;"Well, it was only available on the DARPA net."
26:24;26:27;"I didn't want to get into that."
26:27;26:30;"I didn't want to get into these conspiracy theories."
26:30;26:39;"But there are some questions about the fact that, yes, Charles Manson famously did work at the Zine"
26:39;26:44;"in the months leading up to the infamous Sharon Tate murders."
26:44;26:46;"People have questions about it."
26:46;26:49;"But, you know, look, he was out there."
26:49;26:51;"A lot of people crossed paths with him."
26:51;26:56;"Well, I was going to say a lot of people sort of admit that history is wrong."
26:56;27:03;"Everyone said he wanted to be a rock star and a musician when he actually really just wanted to be a rock critic."
27:03;27:04;"He wanted to be a rock critic."
27:04;27:06;"I didn't know this, but I'm actually on Wikipedia now."
27:06;27:09;"Pitchfork actually dates back to the 1800s."
27:09;27:12;"It was a competitor of the Farmer's Almanac."
27:12;27:15;"And the music section was actually just two pages in the back."
27:15;27:17;"That's how it got its name, Pitchfork."
27:17;27:20;"It was originally the Pitchfork Almanac."
27:20;27:23;"And it dealt mostly with agricultural subjects."
27:23;27:30;"And they would actually review bales of hay, logs, weather, astrological conditions."
27:30;27:32;"There wasn't much music then."
27:32;27:33;"Yeah."
27:33;27:36;"So you've got Woody Guthrie reviews back here."
27:36;27:38;"There's some classical stuff."
27:38;27:40;"It actually existed before there was recorded music."
27:40;27:44;"It's wild. That's why it was so hard to review it."
27:44;27:45;"Yeah, it goes way back."
27:45;27:49;"This actually reminds me of like, there are a lot of fun facts like that."
27:49;27:54;"One of the classics is always in terms of just like fun facts about the origins of companies."
27:54;27:56;"Because this one's actually true."
27:56;28:02;"In case you're wondering, that whole Pitchfork story, it was a total fabrication."
28:02;28:03;"Made up."
28:03;28:04;"Not this one."
28:04;28:05;"False."
28:05;28:06;"We made it up."
28:06;28:10;"But Nintendo actually was started in the 19th century."
28:10;28:12;"It was a playing card company."
28:12;28:13;"Do you guys know that?"
28:13;28:15;"I think this has come up on the show."
28:15;28:17;"Yeah, because that's like one of my favorite facts."
28:17;28:18;"That's amazing."
28:18;28:22;"Trying to make small talk with like somebody's nine-year-old."
28:22;28:29;"Now, you know this company, Nintendo, goes back to the 19th century."
28:29;28:33;"That is the most like old guy I'm going to say to a kid."
28:33;28:35;"Breaking news, I don't care."
28:35;28:37;"See you later, grandpa."
28:37;28:39;"Yeah, I feel like there's some other random ones like that."
28:39;28:44;"But any kind of modern company that goes back to the 19th century."
28:44;28:48;"The funny thing though is in the internet era, that just doesn't happen anymore."
28:48;28:55;"So, yeah, you don't really get those kind of fun stories with like a Pitchfork or like a website or an app or something."
28:55;28:56;"It's never going to be like..."
28:56;28:59;"Supreme Clothes has been making clothes."
28:59;29:00;"Right."
29:00;29:02;"You know, we used to make clothes for farmers."
29:02;29:04;"Maybe in a few hundred years."
29:04;29:09;"Yeah, like even that was an interesting one back in the 90s when Abercrombie & Fitch suddenly became this like..."
29:09;29:11;"I don't know what the right word is."
29:11;29:13;"Chic is probably not the right word."
29:13;29:17;"But when Abercrombie & Fitch became a very youth-oriented cool brand,"
29:17;29:22;"it was kind of funny to read up on the history of Abercrombie & Fitch and be like,"
29:22;29:25;"this company actually goes back to the 19th century."
29:25;29:28;"They made like safari gear for Teddy Roosevelt."
29:28;29:29;"Wow."
29:29;29:31;"What year was Abercrombie & Fitch founded, Seinfeld?"
29:31;29:36;"Now, let's get a number crunch."
29:36;29:39;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
29:39;29:43;"Abercrombie & Fitch, 1892."
29:43;29:45;"They've been in the game for 129 years."
29:45;29:46;"Wow."
29:46;29:47;"Damn."
29:47;29:49;"Yeah, see, that's like funny to think about."
29:49;29:56;"Somewhere in the world, there is a totally modern kid, doesn't give any sh*t about history,"
29:56;30:01;"playing their Nintendo, wearing some Abercrombie & Fitch."
30:01;30:04;"Anyway, maybe that kid is in your own house."
30:04;30:06;"Maybe that's your child."
30:06;30:09;"I want you to go over to them, turn off the Nintendo."
30:09;30:11;"Wait, by the way, I know I sound so old now."
30:11;30:13;"What is the current Nintendo system called?"
30:13;30:16;"Is it DS? Have they done anything since the DS?"
30:16;30:17;"I think the Switch is what people are playing."
30:17;30:18;"Oh, Switch, yeah."
30:18;30:19;"I just love this."
30:19;30:21;"Go tell your son, ""Hey."""
30:21;30:22;"Like I go in, ""Hey, Max."""
30:22;30:24;"I was just talking with the guys."
30:24;30:29;"Did you know, as he's playing on his Switch, did you know that Nintendo, as a company,"
30:29;30:31;"was founded like 120 years ago?"
30:31;30:39;"You turn off the Switch mid-game and say, ""Now, you probably feel like you're really"
30:39;30:46;"a 2020s type kid, but what if I told you that back in the 19th century, you could have been"
30:46;30:51;"buying products from Nintendo and wearing clothes from Abercrombie & Fitch?"
30:51;30:53;"What would you think about that?"""
30:53;30:55;"Well, I wouldn't give a sh*t."
30:55;30:57;"Max, put down the Switch."
30:57;30:59;"Your mother and I have something to tell you."
31:00;31:04;"He turned 35 last Sunday"
31:04;31:08;"And his hair, he found some gray"
31:08;31:13;"But he still ain't changed his lifestyle"
31:13;31:17;"He likes it better the old way"
31:17;31:22;"So he grows a little garden"
31:22;31:24;"In the backyard by the fence"
31:24;31:26;"He's consuming what he's growing"
31:26;31:28;"Nowadays in self-defense"
31:28;31:32;"He gets out there in the twilight zone sometimes"
31:32;31:35;"When it just don't make no sense"
31:35;31:40;"He gets off on country music"
31:40;31:44;"Calls disco left and call"
31:44;31:50;"He's got young friends and a new way"
31:50;31:53;"But he's just too friggin' old"
31:56;31:59;"And he dreams at night of Woodstock"
31:59;32:01;"And the day John Lennon died"
32:01;32:03;"And the music made him happy"
32:03;32:06;"And the silence made him cry"
32:06;32:09;"Yeah, he thinks of John sometimes"
32:09;32:12;"And he has to wonder why"
32:12;32:17;"'Cause he's an old hippie"
32:17;32:19;"And he don't know what to do"
32:19;32:22;"Should he hang on to the old"
32:22;32:24;"Should he grab on to the new"
32:24;32:26;"He's an old hippie"
32:26;32:29;"This new life is just a bust"
32:29;32:31;"He ain't trying to change nobody"
32:31;32:34;"He's just trying real hard to adjust"
32:35;32:36;"You know what's crazy?"
32:36;32:37;"Yeah."
32:37;32:39;"'Cause you're talking about Abercrombie"
32:39;32:42;"And I thought of that brand Hollister"
32:42;32:43;"Which I've always been intrigued by"
32:43;32:45;"'Cause it's like Hollister, California"
32:45;32:47;"Is just sort of such a random"
32:47;32:50;"Unromantic part of the state"
32:50;32:52;"And then I looked it up as we were talking"
32:52;32:53;"And it's owned by Abercrombie"
32:53;32:55;"It was started in 2000"
32:55;32:58;"And Abercrombie wrote a fictional history"
32:58;32:59;"For Hollister & Co."
32:59;33:01;"Whoa. What was the story?"
33:01;33:02;"According to this history"
33:02;33:05;"John Hollister Sr. emigrated from New York City"
33:05;33:07;"To the Dutch East Indies"
33:07;33:09;"And established the company"
33:09;33:11;"Bearing his name upon returning to the United States"
33:11;33:13;"And settling in California in 1922"
33:13;33:15;"However, the company was actually founded"
33:15;33:17;"In Ohio in 2000"
33:17;33:18;"Whoa."
33:18;33:20;"That's like some Einstein Bros. kind of style"
33:20;33:22;"And it's funny because Abercrombie & Fitch"
33:22;33:25;"Already has like a real history as a company"
33:25;33:26;"Well, right."
33:26;33:28;"Is Hollister supposed to be like"
33:28;33:30;"The more California, West Coast side"
33:30;33:31;"Of Abercrombie & Fitch?"
33:31;33:34;"Well, I'm trying to figure out if Hollister was like"
33:34;33:36;"Founded by some dudes in Ohio"
33:36;33:38;"And then bought by Abercrombie"
33:38;33:39;"I'm assuming it kind of was"
33:39;33:43;"The Wikipedia is not that expansive"
33:43;33:45;"I think they started in Ohio in 2000"
33:45;33:48;"As like a Midwest surf brand"
33:48;33:52;"And then Abercrombie wrote this fictional history"
33:52;33:54;"And took the ball and ran with it"
33:54;33:55;"Midwest surf brand"
33:55;33:56;"I wonder if"
33:56;33:57;"And for anybody who doesn't remember"
33:57;33:59;"That was the episode we did"
33:59;34:01;"We got this amazing email from a listener"
34:01;34:03;"About the history of Einstein Bros."
34:03;34:05;"Where they basically realized"
34:05;34:06;"The Einstein Bros. don't exist"
34:06;34:08;"This was like a total"
34:08;34:10;"Just corporate investment firm"
34:10;34:13;"Just like created a kind of fake backstory"
34:13;34:15;"For these fictional guys"
34:15;34:17;"There are no Einstein Bros."
34:17;34:21;"It's not some like family business"
34:21;34:23;"And it's not even one of those stories"
34:23;34:24;"Where a family business gets bought out"
34:24;34:26;"It's totally fabricated"
34:26;34:28;"I wonder if anybody could like"
34:28;34:32;"Successfully sue a retail store"
34:32;34:34;"Or a restaurant"
34:34;34:36;"I wonder if there's ever been a court case"
34:36;34:37;"Where they had to like"
34:37;34:39;"Because you know sometimes you read about"
34:39;34:41;"Cable news pundits"
34:41;34:43;"Who have to use"
34:43;34:45;"I feel like Alex Jones has used this"
34:45;34:47;"Rachel Maddow has used this"
34:47;34:49;"I'm sure Tucker Carlson"
34:49;34:52;"But these hyper partisan news type hosts"
34:52;34:55;"When sometimes they get in these lawsuits"
34:55;34:56;"Where somebody says"
34:56;34:57;"Well you said something untrue"
34:57;34:59;"And obviously that's a big problem"
34:59;35:02;"If a news reporter or an anchor"
35:02;35:03;"Says something untrue"
35:03;35:04;"And I feel like there's this"
35:04;35:06;"I don't know who first used this defense"
35:06;35:08;"But I know I read about"
35:08;35:10;"The Rachel Maddow show using it"
35:10;35:11;"And I'm sure right wing people"
35:11;35:13;"Probably invented it"
35:13;35:14;"And have used it as well"
35:14;35:15;"There was this"
35:15;35:16;"The concept is basically"
35:16;35:17;"They come out and say"
35:17;35:18;"Listen"
35:18;35:19;"The viewers understand"
35:19;35:21;"That we're putting on a show"
35:21;35:23;"And there are going to be things we say"
35:23;35:25;"That might be incorrect"
35:25;35:27;"That might even knowingly be incorrect"
35:27;35:29;"But you know essentially"
35:29;35:31;"We're creating content"
35:31;35:33;"You can't sue Disney"
35:33;35:35;"Because the Marvel Cinematic Universe"
35:35;35:37;"Breaks the laws of physics"
35:37;35:38;"Or whatever"
35:38;35:39;"So there is this argument"
35:39;35:41;"That I guess has been successfully used in court"
35:41;35:43;"As I understand it"
35:43;35:44;"Where you can say"
35:44;35:46;"Wait hold on that was untrue"
35:46;35:47;"Or that was a lie"
35:47;35:49;"Or you knowingly spread misinformation"
35:49;35:50;"And basically they can come back and say"
35:50;35:52;"This is showbiz baby"
35:52;35:53;"Come on"
35:53;35:55;"They actually are"
35:55;35:57;"So the way they describe"
35:57;35:59;"So Abercrombie and Fitch"
35:59;36:01;"Have four"
36:01;36:03;"What they call like concept brands"
36:03;36:05;"That are subsidiaries"
36:05;36:07;"Of which"
36:07;36:09;"So there's Abercrombie Kids"
36:09;36:11;"Which I assume is young"
36:11;36:13;"But takes off the Abercrombie and Fitch real history"
36:13;36:15;"There's Hollister"
36:15;36:16;"Which you've talked about"
36:16;36:18;"Which is quote Southern California Abercrombie"
36:18;36:19;"Themed"
36:19;36:20;"They're all themed"
36:20;36:22;"Themed after SoCal"
36:22;36:23;"For teenagers"
36:23;36:24;"So I think they're sort of"
36:24;36:25;"Obfuscating any"
36:25;36:27;"I don't know if they're worried about being sued"
36:27;36:29;"But the idea is that"
36:29;36:30;"This is a theme"
36:30;36:31;"It's an idea"
36:31;36:32;"It's a fiction"
36:32;36:34;"Gilly Hicks"
36:34;36:36;"The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie and Fitch"
36:36;36:38;"Themed after Down Under Sydney"
36:38;36:40;"So I'm sure that has a whole"
36:40;36:42;"Yeah has a whole history"
36:42;36:43;"This is the one I find most interesting"
36:43;36:45;"Do any of you guys remember"
36:45;36:46;"Rule"
36:46;36:48;"R-U-E-H-L"
36:48;36:50;"Number 925"
36:50;36:53;"It's the post grad Abercrombie and Fitch"
36:53;36:56;"Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage"
36:56;37:00;"Offered clothes for 22-35 post grads"
37:00;37:01;"It closed in 2010"
37:01;37:04;"It's so funny that they have the need to like"
37:04;37:06;"Frame this"
37:06;37:07;"As like themed"
37:07;37:08;"These fictional backstories"
37:08;37:09;"Because"
37:09;37:11;"Most people understand that in fashion"
37:11;37:13;"People use like mood boards"
37:13;37:16;"Like that's like the most classic type of interview"
37:16;37:18;"With a designer"
37:18;37:19;"Is like what inspired you"
37:19;37:21;"You know I'm inspired by New York City"
37:21;37:22;"I'm designing for"
37:22;37:24;"You know the woman who's"
37:24;37:26;"You know in her late 20's"
37:26;37:27;"She can go to a power lunch"
37:27;37:28;"And she can go"
37:28;37:30;"Go party all night"
37:30;37:31;"She lives in Greenwich Village"
37:31;37:33;"Like you can do that"
37:33;37:34;"And nobody's confused"
37:34;37:36;"But it's like they are taking it a step further"
37:36;37:38;"It's not just like their target audience"
37:38;37:39;"Or their mood board"
37:39;37:42;"It's really like a fictional backstory"
37:42;37:43;"I mean listen"
37:43;37:45;"It's all showbiz"
37:45;37:46;"The news"
37:46;37:48;"The bagels you eat"
37:48;37:49;"It's all showbiz"
37:49;37:50;"And they were sued by Levi's"
37:50;37:52;"For copyright infringement"
37:52;37:54;"Abercrombie and Fitch was?"
37:54;37:55;"Yeah"
37:55;37:56;"Well specifically Rule"
37:56;37:58;"Number 925 was"
37:58;37:59;"Wow"
37:59;38:01;"For stealing their like pocket design"
38:01;38:02;"Was Levi Strauss real?"
38:02;38:04;"Or does it turn out that that was a fiction?"
38:04;38:06;"He's made up too"
38:06;38:07;"That was a great backstory"
38:07;38:09;"So a lot of people think that"
38:09;38:11;"There's this very interesting backstory"
38:11;38:12;"That Levi Strauss was this"
38:12;38:14;"Immigrant guy who"
38:14;38:15;"Went to"
38:15;38:17;"Came to California during the gold rush"
38:17;38:18;"He didn't find any gold"
38:18;38:19;"But he started making these"
38:19;38:21;"Really durable denim"
38:21;38:22;"Dungarees"
38:22;38:23;"For the miners"
38:23;38:24;"And that's the"
38:24;38:25;"The backstory"
38:25;38:26;"Of Levi Strauss"
38:26;38:28;"So also going back to the 19th century"
38:28;38:29;"But the truth is"
38:29;38:31;"It was also started"
38:31;38:33;"Right around the year 2000 in Ohio"
38:33;38:35;"By a bunch of Vassar grads"
38:35;38:38;"Honey it talks"
38:38;38:40;"But it don't sing and dance"
38:40;38:43;"And it don't walk"
38:44;38:48;"Long as I can have you here with me"
38:48;38:50;"I'd much rather be"
38:50;38:53;"Forever in blue jeans"
38:53;38:59;"Honey it's sweet"
38:59;39:04;"But it ain't nothing next to baby's treat"
39:04;39:07;"And if you pardon me"
39:07;39:09;"I'd like to say"
39:09;39:12;"We do okay"
39:12;39:15;"Forever in blue jeans"
39:15;39:21;"Baby tonight"
39:21;39:25;"Baby tonight by the fire"
39:25;39:28;"All alone you and I"
39:28;39:33;"Nothing around"
39:33;39:35;"But the sound of my heart"
39:35;39:37;"And your sighs"
39:37;39:39;"This is some TC news from about"
39:39;39:41;"Almost three weeks ago"
39:41;39:44;"This really roiled the rock community"
39:44;39:47;"The rock community was roiled by this"
39:47;39:49;"Pearl Jam and Motley Crue"
39:49;39:51;"Finally got into it"
39:51;39:54;"And it all started with Eddie Vedder"
39:54;39:56;"Telling a story to the New York Times"
39:56;39:57;"This is what Eddie Vedder said"
39:57;39:59;"You know I used to work in San Diego"
39:59;40:01;"Loading gear at a club"
40:01;40:02;"I'd end up being at shows"
40:02;40:04;"That I wouldn't have chosen to go to"
40:04;40:06;"Bands that monopolized late 80s MTV"
40:06;40:08;"The metal bands that"
40:08;40:09;"I'm trying to be nice"
40:09;40:11;"I despised"
40:11;40:13;"Not trying that hard Eddie but okay"
40:13;40:15;"Wait he said I'm trying to be nice"
40:15;40:17;"I despised them?"
40:17;40:18;"Yeah"
40:18;40:19;"I mean maybe he's"
40:19;40:20;"Look obviously we don't know how he said it"
40:20;40:22;"I could imagine he might have said"
40:22;40:24;"Maybe he meant I want to be nice"
40:24;40:25;"But yeah maybe he's saying"
40:25;40:26;"These metal bands that"
40:26;40:28;"Oh man I'm trying to be nice"
40:28;40:31;"But I despise them"
40:31;40:32;"Anyway he says"
40:32;40:34;"Girls girls girls and Motley Crue"
40:34;40:36;"F*** you I hated it"
40:36;40:38;"I hated how it made the fellas look"
40:38;40:40;"I hated how it made the women look"
40:40;40:41;"It felt so vacuous"
40:41;40:42;"Guns N' Roses came out"
40:42;40:43;"And thank god at least"
40:43;40:45;"Had some teeth"
40:45;40:46;"But I'm circling back to say"
40:46;40:47;"That one thing that I appreciated"
40:47;40:48;"Was that in Seattle"
40:48;40:50;"And the alternative crowd"
40:50;40:51;"The girls could wear their combat boots"
40:51;40:52;"And sweaters"
40:52;40:53;"And their hair looked like"
40:53;40:54;"Cat powers"
40:54;40:56;"And not Heather Locklear's"
40:56;40:57;"Nothing against her"
40:57;40:59;"Alright"
40:59;41:00;"I missed this part"
41:00;41:01;"This is deep"
41:01;41:03;"They weren't selling themselves short"
41:03;41:05;"They could have an opinion"
41:05;41:06;"And be respected"
41:06;41:08;"I think that's a change that lasted"
41:08;41:09;"It sounds so trite"
41:09;41:10;"But before then"
41:10;41:12;"It was bustiers"
41:12;41:13;"The only person who wore a bustier"
41:13;41:14;"In the 90s"
41:14;41:15;"That I could appreciate"
41:15;41:16;"Was Perry Farrell"
41:16;41:17;"Interesting"
41:17;41:18;"Jake what's your take"
41:18;41:19;"Here in this spicy take"
41:19;41:20;"From Eddie Vedder"
41:20;41:21;"He turned it into"
41:21;41:23;"Something larger than it needed to be"
41:23;41:25;"He turned it into a whole referendum"
41:25;41:28;"On feminism in the 90s"
41:28;41:30;"Versus Reagan era"
41:30;41:32;"Retrograde attitudes"
41:32;41:34;"Between the genders in the 80s"
41:34;41:36;"And he's putting that on Motley Crue"
41:36;41:38;"Now I can understand"
41:38;41:40;"Where he doesn't like Motley Crue"
41:40;41:41;"They're not a good band"
41:41;41:42;"I agree"
41:42;41:43;"And maybe we'll get into this later"
41:43;41:44;"When we talk about"
41:44;41:45;"Song catalogs"
41:45;41:48;"Selling for outrageous sums of money"
41:48;41:49;"Motley Crue"
41:49;41:50;"They don't have the catalog"
41:50;41:52;"So I understand where he's coming from"
41:52;41:54;"He takes it to this"
41:54;41:56;"Pretty personal level"
41:56;41:57;"In a way"
41:57;41:58;"And I could see"
41:58;41:59;"Where Nikki Sixx sees that"
41:59;42:00;"And he's like"
42:00;42:01;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
42:01;42:02;"Like"
42:02;42:04;"You don't know about my relationships"
42:04;42:06;"Or how I view"
42:06;42:08;"The wardrobe choices of women or whatever"
42:08;42:10;"He had like a narrow critique"
42:10;42:12;"And then it kind of got away from him"
42:12;42:13;"Maybe a little bit"
42:13;42:14;"Yeah"
42:14;42:16;"And I'm sure that the main take away"
42:16;42:17;"From this whole thing"
42:17;42:19;"Was just Pearl Jam versus Motley Crue"
42:19;42:21;"But you see people get in trouble sometimes"
42:21;42:22;"This kind of"
42:22;42:23;"Sometimes they think they're saying"
42:23;42:24;"Something really positive"
42:24;42:25;"But they're also kind of still"
42:25;42:27;"Categorizing and dividing people"
42:27;42:28;"So you could imagine"
42:28;42:30;"Maybe somewhere there's two women"
42:30;42:31;"Maybe they're sisters"
42:31;42:32;"Maybe they're friends"
42:32;42:33;"Maybe they're a couple"
42:33;42:34;"I don't know"
42:34;42:36;"One of them looks like Cat Power"
42:36;42:37;"One of them looks like Heather Locklear"
42:37;42:39;"They live their lives differently"
42:39;42:40;"They dress differently"
42:40;42:42;"But they have equal respect for each other"
42:42;42:44;"And they're reading this article together"
42:44;42:46;"They're holding the New York Times together"
42:46;42:48;"Reading about the new Eddie Vedder album"
42:48;42:49;"They see this and they say"
42:49;42:50;"Man"
42:50;42:52;"What's this divide and conquer stuff?"
42:52;42:54;"Cat Powers and Heather Locklear"
42:54;42:56;"We've been trying to unite for decades"
42:56;42:58;"And we still got these rock dudes"
42:58;42:59;"Keeping us apart"
42:59;43:01;"Making these comments about"
43:01;43:03;"Oh you respect yourself"
43:03;43:04;"You have no self respect"
43:04;43:05;"You have an opinion"
43:05;43:06;"You can't have an opinion"
43:06;43:08;"What if my opinion is"
43:08;43:10;"That I love Motley Crue?"
43:10;43:12;"This makes me want to look up"
43:12;43:13;"Before we get too far"
43:13;43:14;"I want to look up the lyrics to"
43:14;43:15;"Girls, Girls, Girls"
43:15;43:18;"Cause he references that song in particular"
43:18;43:20;"I can picture the chorus"
43:20;43:23;"Girls, girls, girls"
43:26;43:27;"Wait"
43:27;43:29;"Matt, cue up Girls, Girls, Girls"
43:29;43:30;"Opening line"
43:30;43:32;"Friday night and I need a fight"
43:32;43:34;"My motorcycle and a switchblade knife"
43:34;43:36;"Handful of grease and my hair feels right"
43:36;43:38;"But what I need to make me tight are"
43:38;43:39;"Girls, girls, girls"
43:39;43:41;"Long legs and burgundy lips"
43:41;43:43;"Girls dancing down on Sunset Strip"
43:43;43:46;"Girls, red lips, fingertips"
43:46;43:48;"I mean, all he's really saying is that"
43:48;43:50;"He likes girls"
43:50;43:51;"He likes the girls that are dressing up"
43:51;43:53;"Going to the show"
44:15;44:17;"Such a cruddy riff"
44:17;44:20;"Are you sure Motley Crue doesn't have the catalog, Jake?"
44:20;44:22;"I stand by that call"
44:22;44:24;"Friday night and I need a fight"
44:24;44:27;"My motorcycle and a switchblade knife"
44:27;44:31;"Handful of grease and my hair feels right"
44:31;44:34;"But what I need to make me tight are"
44:34;44:37;"Those girls, girls, girls"
44:37;44:41;"Long legs and burgundy lips"
44:41;44:42;"Long legs"
44:42;44:44;"Girls, girls, girls"
44:44;44:48;"Dancing down on Sunset Strip"
44:48;44:50;"Girls, girls, girls"
44:50;44:53;"I love the Sunset Strip shout-out"
44:53;44:55;"I love the local energy"
44:55;44:59;"Trick or treat, sweet to sweet"
44:59;45:02;"I'm horny, man, do you see?"
45:02;45:05;"Yankee girls, your chest can't be beat"
45:05;45:09;"Please help us dance, we're about to beat"
45:09;45:10;"Girls, girls, girls"
45:10;45:14;"He's also trying to do a Beach Boys thing, you know, of like"
45:14;45:17;"I wish they all could be California girls"
45:17;45:18;"Say what you will about Vince Cale"
45:18;45:20;"He had a unique time"
45:20;45:22;"Rockin' in Atlanta and Tattletales"
45:22;45:25;"I think he's also just naming strip clubs now"
45:25;45:28;"He could shout out the Dollhouse in Fort Lauderdale"
45:28;45:33;"Tattletales in Atlanta and the 7th Vale, which is in LA"
45:33;45:36;"With the Soho Tribune"
45:36;45:38;"Yeah, no, she didn't mean it"
45:38;45:41;"But then she broke my heart"
45:41;45:43;"Now he's talking about a woman who broke his heart"
45:43;45:46;"I'm a good, good boy"
45:46;45:49;"I just need a new toy"
45:49;45:53;"I'll tell you what, girl, dance for me"
45:53;45:56;"I'll give you all the glory"
45:56;46:00;"Just tell me a story"
46:00;46:03;"You know the one I mean"
46:03;46:09;"He's not saying anything too wild. He's just, I love girls, I love strip clubs"
46:09;46:12;"I mean, I think also this is one of these funny things where"
46:12;46:14;"when people are really offended by something"
46:14;46:18;"it's rarely just about whatever narrow thing they say to make their point"
46:18;46:23;"they're usually just offended by the whole thing, you know, the gestalt"
46:23;46:26;"So for instance, I'm sure if the New York Times pressed Eddie on this"
46:26;46:30;"and they said, ""Yeah, but Eddie, you know, you're dissing the song 'Girls, Girls, Girls'"
46:30;46:33;"are the lyrics really that different than 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys?"""
46:33;46:37;"and Eddie would say, ""Oh no, I love the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson's a genius"""
46:37;46:40;"'cause Eddie Vedder, he's like a real music dude"
46:40;46:44;"There's no way Eddie Vedder doesn't know Pet Sounds, 'Inside Out'"
46:44;46:46;"I know that that song's not on Pet Sounds"
46:46;46:51;"or if you even said like, ""Yeah, but you know, there's some Led Zeppelin"
46:51;46:56;"some kind of like weird, just like, I love girls and I wanna have sex type songs"
46:56;46:58;"he'd probably, ""No, I like Led Zeppelin"""
46:58;47:01;"and then even with just shouting out strip clubs and stuff"
47:01;47:04;"you'd be like, ""Do you think Drake is vacuous?"""
47:04;47:08;"and he might be like, ""Well, you know, it's not my thing, but I respect Drake"""
47:08;47:12;"So, you know, and I'm not dissing Eddie Vedder at all, a huge respect for him"
47:12;47:16;"but I think in a way he's zooming in on one aspect of Motley Crue"
47:16;47:18;"and he's talking about the women"
47:18;47:21;"but I think deep in his heart, what he really wants to say is"
47:21;47:24;"""I just f***ing hate that band, they don't have the catalogue, I always thought they sucked"""
47:24;47:26;"Yeah, they're a crappy band"
47:26;47:27;"and that's what happens in interviews"
47:27;47:30;"I actually had this thought too, and I definitely don't wanna open this can of worms"
47:30;47:36;"but remember there was another kind of overhyped battle a few weeks or months ago"
47:36;47:39;"and it was Damon Albarn vs Taylor Swift"
47:39;47:40;"You hear about this?"
47:40;47:42;"Right, I did"
47:42;47:45;"We're getting the TC take, two months later"
47:45;47:48;"and Damon Albarn said something very foolish"
47:48;47:50;"and as I understand it, totally incorrect"
47:50;47:52;"he said Taylor Swift doesn't write her own songs"
47:52;47:54;"Everybody knows she writes her own songs"
47:54;47:57;"Is she written with people? Sure, but like"
47:57;47:59;"you don't even need to be a huge Taylor Swift fan to know that"
47:59;48:02;"yes, she plays guitar, she strums chords"
48:02;48:05;"she has a very unique songwriting style"
48:05;48:07;"and she writes her own lyrics"
48:07;48:09;"like, who do you think writes her songs?"
48:09;48:11;"She's worked with a million different producers"
48:11;48:14;"and yet she has a remarkably consistent career"
48:14;48:17;"and way of expressing herself"
48:17;48:20;"so Max Martin didn't write her song"
48:20;48:22;"you know, Jack Anoff didn't write her song"
48:22;48:24;"she's worked with a million people and she does her thing"
48:24;48:26;"and then Damon's like ""do your own research"""
48:26;48:28;"Yeah, do your own research, man"
48:28;48:30;"He was totally incorrect, who knows"
48:30;48:33;"he might have been... he apologized very quickly"
48:33;48:36;"and then I remember when I was kind of reading about it"
48:36;48:38;"Apologizing"
48:38;48:41;"When I was reading about it, it was very strange"
48:41;48:43;"because he said something about"
48:43;48:44;"well yeah, she doesn't write her own songs"
48:44;48:46;"but you know who I really like?"
48:46;48:48;"She said she co-writes her songs"
48:48;48:49;"which he was drawing, he was differentiating"
48:49;48:51;"between writing and co-writing"
48:51;48:52;"and then he said, you know who I like?"
48:52;48:54;"I like Billie Eilish"
48:54;48:56;"She and her brother write the songs together"
48:56;48:58;"and she's very dark and cool"
48:58;49:00;"and I'm reading this and I'm like"
49:00;49:02;"they must have had some long conversation"
49:02;49:03;"or he was just out of it"
49:03;49:04;"because that doesn't make sense"
49:04;49:05;"it doesn't make sense to say"
49:05;49:07;"I don't like her because she doesn't write her songs"
49:07;49:09;"she's a co-writer"
49:09;49:10;"but you know who I really like?"
49:10;49:12;"I like this other singer who co-writes"
49:12;49:14;"and her music's darker"
49:14;49:16;"and I just remember, it was a similar feeling I had"
49:16;49:18;"where I was like, listen man"
49:18;49:19;"all you're trying to say is"
49:19;49:21;"you're not into Taylor Swift"
49:21;49:23;"and in some ways I think that got obscured by it"
49:23;49:25;"it's like, it's a matter of taste"
49:25;49:27;"you like Billie Eilish, you don't like Taylor Swift"
49:27;49:29;"alright, Eddie Vedder likes Guns N' Roses"
49:29;49:31;"he doesn't like Motley Crue"
49:31;49:33;"sometimes it's just not that deep"
49:33;49:35;"and I think in Damon Albarn's case"
49:35;49:37;"he paid a price for misspeaking"
49:37;49:39;"and being incorrect"
49:39;49:42;"but really all he was trying to say was"
49:42;49:43;"he had some weird reaction"
49:43;49:45;"and instead, and rather than just say"
49:45;49:47;"his mind went to"
49:47;49:50;"maybe a topic that he cares about a lot"
49:50;49:53;"which is who writes versus co-writes"
49:53;49:54;"and the same thing with Eddie Vedder"
49:54;49:55;"you can't just say like"
49:55;49:57;"I'm not a Motley Crue guy"
49:57;49:59;"it's about like, the fact that"
49:59;50:01;"Cat Power has had more self-respect"
50:01;50:02;"than Heather Locklear"
50:02;50:04;"or things of that nature"
50:04;50:06;"anyway, and also I want to say"
50:06;50:08;"as with all this stuff"
50:08;50:10;"we don't have the whole transcript"
50:10;50:12;"this could have been wide-ranging interviews"
50:12;50:14;"Eddie Vedder seems like a very thoughtful guy"
50:14;50:16;"I bet if he sat down with"
50:16;50:18;"the members of Motley Crue"
50:18;50:20;"they'd probably actually have a lot to talk about"
50:20;50:21;"Eddie Vedder and Mick Mars sat down"
50:21;50:22;"they'd hug it out, man"
50:22;50:24;"I bet they both appreciate"
50:24;50:25;"Pete Townsend"
50:25;50:27;"they'd probably have more in common than you'd think"
50:27;50:29;"I guess Mick Mars was the sort of like, older dude"
50:29;50:31;"who had been in like, psych bands"
50:31;50:33;"in the late 60s or early 70s"
50:33;50:35;"he was like, 35"
50:35;50:37;"when Motley Crue started"
50:37;50:40;"and like, Vince Neil was like, 22 or something"
50:40;50:42;"yeah, I think Mick Mars is like a solid"
50:42;50:44;"20 years older than Tommy Lee"
50:44;50:51;"""So, she said, have I got a little story for you"
50:51;50:54;"what you thought was your daddy"
50:54;50:57;"was nothing but"
50:57;50:59;"a wild Louis City"
50:59;51:03;"home alone Betty 13"
51:03;51:07;"your real Betty was dying"
51:07;51:10;"sorry you didn't see them"
51:10;51:14;"but I'm glad I didn't talk"
51:14;51:21;"oh I, oh I'm still alive"
51:21;51:27;"yeah I, oh I'm still alive"
51:27;51:34;"yeah I, oh I'm still alive"
51:34;51:38;"yeah I'm alive"""
51:38;51:40;"So then Nikki Sixx shoots back"
51:40;51:43;"Oh yeah, so what did Nikki Sixx, so Nikki Sixx reads all this"
51:43;51:47;"He reads this on the NYT.com"
51:47;51:50;"sipping his iced coffee, he opts on Twitter"
51:50;51:54;"""Made me laugh today reading how much the singer in Pearl Jam hated Motley Crue"
51:54;51:57;"now considering that they're one of the most boring bands in history"
51:57;51:59;"it's kind of a compliment, isn't it?"
51:59;52:03;"#TheStadiumTour #RockAndRoll"""
52:03;52:04;"Okay"
52:04;52:06;"In replies to the fans on Twitter"
52:06;52:09;"Nikki Sixx also compared Vedder's vocal style"
52:09;52:11;"as singing with marbles in your mouth"
52:11;52:15;"and responded to a Pearl Jam fan who tweeted in defense of Vedder"
52:15;52:20;"""Remember there were zillions of brown-haired bands for brown-haired fans"
52:20;52:21;"go find them"
52:21;52:24;"you will know them by the bored look on their face"""
52:24;52:26;"What's that?"
52:26;52:28;"That's the best part"
52:28;52:30;"that's the most kind of intriguing part"
52:30;52:34;"he's shouting out brown-haired fans"
52:34;52:36;"that love brown-haired bands"
52:36;52:39;"#Ooooh my brown-haired fan #"
52:39;52:41;"#My haired band #"
52:41;52:45;"#Do you remember when we used to sing #"
52:45;52:47;"So he likes the bleach blonde look"
52:47;52:50;"that's it, you know, either dye jet black or bleach blonde"
52:50;52:52;"he's ride or die"
52:52;52:54;"Well I guess in a way also"
52:54;52:58;"I kind of respect Nikki Sixx for just like cutting to the heart of the matter"
52:58;53:00;"'cause I think, you know, Eddie Vedder"
53:00;53:01;"he's thoughtful"
53:01;53:06;"he's thinking about feminism and these big questions"
53:06;53:09;"and then Nikki Sixx though perceives what's really happening"
53:09;53:10;"which is just like"
53:10;53:13;"""Hey man, you don't f*ck with us, we don't f*ck with you"
53:13;53:15;"you have your natural brown hair"
53:15;53:17;"we actually have fun"
53:17;53:19;"you guys just go out being like regular guys"
53:19;53:21;"we actually go out and get shiny interesting clothes"""
53:21;53:23;"you know, he's like, we're showmen"
53:23;53:24;"He's like, it's showbiz baby"
53:24;53:27;"This is showbiz, you guys don't even put on a good show"
53:27;53:29;"so you know, it's just like two different schools of thought"
53:29;53:30;"that's all that's really happening"
53:30;53:32;"I have to say, I mean, I almost have to"
53:32;53:34;"it makes me like Motley Crue more"
53:34;53:36;"I mean, I think they're a terrible band"
53:36;53:41;"but they have a more honest relationship to their work maybe"
53:41;53:46;"Pearl Jam, there's this element of pretension that Nikki Sixx is responding to"
53:46;53:48;"Pearl Jam's a rock band"
53:48;53:50;"And there's always going to be that divide"
53:50;53:51;"Yeah"
53:51;53:53;"I feel like there's some famous quotes from like"
53:53;53:56;"one of the Gallagher brothers being like"
53:56;53:59;"'cause famously, as we've talked about on the show"
53:59;54:02;"the Gallaghers are always getting asked by the press"
54:02;54:04;"'What do you think of this band? What do you think of that band?'"
54:04;54:07;"And I feel like a through line in what they both say"
54:07;54:09;"which is pretty consistent with their music"
54:09;54:11;"is they're just like, 'What do you think of Radiohead?'"
54:11;54:13;"and he's like, 'Ahh, for f*ck's sake'"
54:13;54:14;"'What do you think of this band?'"
54:14;54:17;"They're always just like, 'I don't like that sad sh*t'"
54:17;54:19;"'It's rock and roll, let's have some fun'"
54:19;54:23;"'Get out there, kick some ass, have a gin and tonic, come on'"
54:23;54:25;"You know, it's just like, it's a worldview thing"
54:25;54:27;"They just don't understand why somebody would"
54:27;54:29;"waste their time with that sh*t"
54:29;54:32;"when you could go just like, go rock out, have fun"
54:32;54:34;"you know, keep the tempos up"
54:34;54:36;"Alright, yeah, we could do a ballad every now and then"
54:36;54:38;"but for f*ck's sake man, it's rock and roll"
54:38;54:40;"It's just a worldview"
54:40;54:42;"This battle reminds me of one of the"
54:42;54:45;"one of my favorite things about the Pam and Tommy show"
54:45;54:48;"that a friend of the show, Hannah, is directing on it"
54:48;54:50;"which is like Tommy Lee"
54:50;54:54;"realizing his irrelevance and sort of noticing like"
54:54;54:56;"the rise of grunge at the time"
54:56;54:58;"and then like, in certain situations, reading a magazine"
54:58;55:00;"and responding it to, like, anyway"
55:00;55:02;"It's a cool motif"
55:02;55:04;"You were saying, because I haven't actually"
55:04;55:06;"caught up on the show yet, but you were saying"
55:06;55:08;"there's a scene where he's hanging out at the Viper Room"
55:08;55:09;"Right"
55:09;55:11;"In like, the show starts at 95"
55:11;55:13;"I've seen the first episode or two"
55:13;55:16;"and he's hanging out in the Viper Room in like 95 or whatever"
55:16;55:18;"and like, they're blasting Slater Kinney"
55:18;55:20;"Yeah, he's in the Viper Room"
55:20;55:22;"to blow off some steam or whatever"
55:22;55:24;"they're blasting Slater Kinney"
55:24;55:26;"and he's just like, ugh, he's disgusted"
55:26;55:28;"but he turns to the bartender who's like"
55:28;55:30;"you know, in her early 20s, and he's like"
55:30;55:32;"""What is this sh*t?"" and she's like, ""It's Slater Kinney!"""
55:32;55:34;"""It's awesome!"" and he's just like"
55:34;55:36;"so upset about it"
55:36;55:38;"and then he gets into a big fight"
55:38;55:40;"There's another moment where he's reading"
55:40;55:42;"Kerrang! magazine"
55:42;55:44;"and it's like, the headline is like"
55:44;55:46;"""Is Seattle the new LA?"""
55:46;55:48;"and he goes, ""No, it's not!"""
55:48;55:50;"and he throws the magazine"
55:50;55:52;"and like, Alanis Morissette plays it"
55:52;55:54;"It's just like this constant reminder"
55:54;55:56;"of like, him post-Motley Crue"
55:56;55:58;"pre-Methods of Mayhem or whatever"
55:58;56:00;"sort of just like, losing his"
56:00;56:02;"his identity"
56:02;56:04;"This battle reminds me of that"
56:04;56:06;"I hope Eddie Vedder is watching"
56:06;56:08;"the Pam and Tommy show because"
56:08;56:10;"it's always a good exercise"
56:10;56:12;"and empathy to really put yourself in somebody's shoes"
56:12;56:14;"and maybe Eddie Vedder should"
56:14;56:16;"remember that the 90s were tough"
56:16;56:18;"for these guys. The whole culture"
56:18;56:20;"changed. Pearl Jam comes out"
56:20;56:22;"starts selling millions of records"
56:22;56:24;"This is almost the equivalent"
56:24;56:26;"of the"
56:26;56:28;"old school, like, vaudeville"
56:28;56:30;"vaudevillians, you know?"
56:30;56:32;"Is it high art? Maybe not"
56:32;56:34;"but these people, they knew how to work a crowd"
56:34;56:36;"in person. And next thing you know, the pictures"
56:36;56:38;"come out. And here you are"
56:38;56:40;"you know, you're some"
56:40;56:42;"65 year old guy"
56:42;56:44;"you were born in 1860"
56:44;56:46;"and now the pictures come out"
56:46;56:48;"and you say, ""I don't know how to work"
56:48;56:50;"how to do this. I gotta"
56:50;56:52;"get the energy of a crowd. I like to put on a show"
56:52;56:54;"and people say, ""That's not what's"
56:54;56:56;"happening, man. That's tough."""
56:56;56:58;"That's like Seinfeld trying to hop on TikTok"
56:58;57:00;"It's bewildering"
57:00;57:02;"I love the idea of Eddie Vedder at home"
57:02;57:04;"watching"
57:04;57:06;"Hulu, putting on"
57:06;57:08;"Pam and Tommy"
57:08;57:10;"You know he does. On February 6th"
57:10;57:12;"while Vedder was performing in Newark, New Jersey"
57:12;57:14;"he introduced his backing band"
57:14;57:16;"which included Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer"
57:16;57:18;"Chad Smith. Vedder said"
57:18;57:20;"""That drum kit"
57:20;57:22;"that silver beautiful machine that is the engine"
57:22;57:24;"does not need to elevate or rotate"
57:24;57:26;"it to its job. Let me just point that out."""
57:26;57:28;"I love that he's like"
57:28;57:30;"I cut you out. Alright"
57:30;57:32;"Now I kind of love this whole thing"
57:32;57:34;"and I gotta give Eddie Vedder respect that he's just like"
57:34;57:36;"keeping it going. Yeah"
57:36;57:38;"Maybe Eddie Vedder is a little more"
57:38;57:40;"into showbiz razzle dazzle than we think"
57:40;57:42;"because you know he made"
57:42;57:44;"Game Recognize Game. Yeah, Game Recognize Game"
57:44;57:46;"At the end of the day"
57:46;57:48;"these are two rock stars. Two of the best"
57:48;57:50;"going at it. Would CT call his drum kit"
57:50;57:52;"a machine? A silver beautiful"
57:52;57:54;"machine? No, and I feel"
57:54;57:56;"like it's, I don't think that"
57:56;57:58;"it fits the definition of a machine"
57:58;58:00;"Totally. Unless they have"
58:00;58:02;"that sort of like food technology"
58:02;58:04;"kind of, sort of liberal"
58:04;58:06;"definition"
58:06;58:08;"I don't think it's a machine"
58:08;58:10;"Guacamole is a technology"
58:10;58:12;"and a drum kit is a machine"
58:12;58:14;"It's a simple machine, but it's a machine"
58:14;58:16;"It's a machine"
58:16;58:18;"I'm a figure in my tree"
58:18;58:20;"Yeah"
58:20;58:26;"Newspapers matter not to me"
58:26;58:28;"Yeah"
58:28;58:34;"No more crowbars"
58:34;58:36;"to my head"
58:36;58:38;"Yeah"
58:38;58:44;"I'm trading stories with the least"
58:44;58:46;"of these"
58:46;58:48;"instead"
58:48;58:50;"Yeah"
58:50;59:02;"Where to all my"
59:02;59:04;"friends"
59:04;59:06;"Yeah"
59:06;59:10;"They don't seem to notice"
59:10;59:12;"me"
59:12;59:14;"No"
59:14;59:18;"I ride"
59:18;59:20;"straight on the street"
59:20;59:22;"Yeah"
59:22;59:24;"Oh"
59:24;59:28;"Sidewalks, cigarettes"
59:28;59:30;"and Cintas"
59:30;59:36;"And I feel so hot"
59:36;59:38;"I start to say"
59:38;59:40;"Oh I feel"
59:40;59:42;"so hot the sky is red"
59:42;59:46;"I'm so hot I hold just one breath"
59:46;59:48;"Deep breath in my chest"
59:48;59:50;"Just like innocent"
59:50;59:52;"I also like the idea that"
59:52;59:54;"Chad Smith, legendary drummer of the"
59:54;59:56;"Chili Peppers is just sitting back there"
59:56;59:58;"and he's like, he's always"
59:58;01:00:00;"seemed like kind of like a chilled out dude"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"like if you remember in the classic"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"the classic Chili Peppers"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Doc Funky Monks, which is"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"a truly a beautiful film"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"find it if you can, it's a beautiful"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"black and white movie about the making of"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"blood sugar sex magic"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"and you always get the impression that like"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"obviously Flea and Anthony Kiedis, they're like"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"blood brothers going back forever"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"and then Frusciante is this kind of like"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"freaky guitar genius and then"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"Chad Smith, he's like always seemed like he's out on his own"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"trip, he's like I'm not staying at that house"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"just driving his motorcycle up, so he just seemed"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"like the type of dude that probably"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I'm not guessing he's a huge Motley Crue"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"fan, but I could imagine that he's"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I've thrown back some drinks with Mick Mars"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"before, he's a cool dude"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"you could imagine Eddie Vedder's dragging him"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"into this and he's sitting there like with no mic"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"behind the drum kit"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"and he's just like, he's just kind of gesturing"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"just like, Eddie come on, oh man"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"don't, I don't want any, oh come on"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"in fact, I've probably"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"said this on the show years ago, but"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I remember in Anthony Kiedis' memoir"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"he's describing"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"a schism within the band"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"where he says like, I was really"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"angry and I felt this way about the issue"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Flea was with me, but"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"John, he was on the opposite"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"side and we could not make heads or tails"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"we could not find any common ground"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"and then I always remember this line, he says"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Chad, stayed"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Switzerland, and I always"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"think about that, Chad stayed Switzerland"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"some drama in the band"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"they look over to Chad"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Chad, come on man, help us make this decision"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"are you with Frusciante or are you with me and Flea"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"and Chad's just like, guys"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"you guys work it out"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"it seems like a lot of bands are going to have that guy like in the Metallica doc"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"that would be Kirk Hammett"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"he stays Switzerland, which is like, guys come on"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"stop fighting"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"guys, it's just showbiz"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"get out, so yeah, you could imagine that"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"maybe you're Chad Smith and you're, you stay"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Switzerland, you've been around a lot of big"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"personalities in your life and"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"you know, Eddie Vedder's known to be a very chilled out"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"cool guy, so maybe you're like"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"alright, you know, I'm going to just go play a little"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"get behind the kit for Eddie, be a nice"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"little thing, next thing you know you're getting dragged into"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"a beef with Motley Crue"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"I could imagine after the show, Chad's just like"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Eddie man, that wasn't"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"cool, don't pull me into this"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"yeah, did you check out that new Chili single?"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"oh, of course"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"I thought it was great"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"I mean, I'm loving the Frusciante work"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I'm loving the sort of like"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"mild Irish"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"lilt, sea shanty vibe"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"that Keatons is bringing to the"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"vocal performance"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Frusciante, it's great"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"it's good stuff, it's really good"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"I also, it's funny, it's been a very Chili Peppers"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"centric time cause"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"I read Scar Tissue years ago"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"and then I'd had a copy of Flea's book"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"for a couple years"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"and it was just sitting on the shelf"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"and I knew I wanted to read it at some point, it just so happened that"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"that point came"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"a couple weeks ago, so I grabbed it and I"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"read it, then the song came out, so I've been thinking a lot about"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"the Chili Peppers"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"although Flea's book basically ends"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"with the Chili Peppers first gig"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"it's kind of a memoir of his childhood"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"yeah, it's cool, I think"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"probably Flea said, you know, Keatons wrote"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Scar Tissue, that's like the juicy"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"memoir, a lot of stuff"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"about the band, and Flea"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"who he makes clear in his book is like"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"always been a huge reader, a huge"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"fan of literature, he wrote something"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"kind of more impressionistic, and yeah"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"basically, he sometimes fast"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"forwards, but it's like, it basically"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"ends with the first Chili Peppers gig"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"so it's really about his memories of growing up"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"and, you know,"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"stuff with his family, and"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"you know, kid stuff, it's cool"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"the stuff I usually skip in rock memoirs"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"yeah, I wonder if you'd like it"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"he's a good writer and it's cool"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"I mean, I'll tell you one thing, I think this might sell you on it"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Jake, and anybody else who's listening"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"just the basics of Flea's story"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"if you don't know, is that he's born in Australia"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"he's Australian, didn't know that"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"his dad got a job"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"at like the Australian consulate in New York"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"so he's like four or five"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"the whole family packs up, leaves"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Australia, moves to New York"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"but, um, this is the"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"late 60s, so the family"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"chose not to like, live in Manhattan"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"they live in suburban Rye, New York"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"in Westchester, so then"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"the next few years of his life, he's like growing up in"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Rye, New York, and then his"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"parents have a pretty like, dramatic"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"harsh split, and the"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"dad goes back to Australia, and the mom takes"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"the kids, Flea's mom takes"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Flea and his sister, to live with her new"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"boyfriend, who's a"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"a jazz bassist who lives"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"in his parents' basement"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"in Rye, New York"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"so they go from this like, family"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"you know, traditional family to"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"dad's back in Australia, now we're living with"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"this kind of stepdad figure who's"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"like, a kind of intense jazz"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"musician, who has like a weird"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"little apartment in his own"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"parents' house, so now he's in"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"this bohemian lifestyle, and a few years"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"after that, then his mom and his"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"stepdad, the jazz bassist"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Walter, decide"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"that it would be better for his work and for"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"his music if they moved to LA"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"so then they just moved to like, smack"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"dab in the middle of just like, weird"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"funky Hollywood, and then"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"from age like, 10"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"until adulthood, he's"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"just growing up in Hollywood"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"like, the streets of Hollywood, and he talks about like"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"being a kid, and his parents were a little"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"checked out, so he talks about being a kid and like, doing"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"normal kid stuff, but it's like the weird Hollywood"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"version of it, so like, you know"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"climbing up some like, you know"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"four story apartment complex and jumping into"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"the pool, or just like, a weird"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"night where he just like, walks up to Hollywood"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"Boulevard at 2am"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"and just like, talking"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"to like, the weirdos up there, so and that's"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"it's like a very evocative picture of like"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"LA in the 70s, and his kind of"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"like, suddenly now when I drive"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"through Hollywood, I'm just like, picturing like"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"like a 12 year old flea, and a bunch of"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"kids just like, running around, it was like"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"an interesting atmosphere to the book."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Yeah, that sounds awesome. It also just makes"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"me, this is very like, prosaic"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"observation, but it makes me trip out on like"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"all the forks in the road not taken"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"how random stuff is, like if Flea's"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"dad had not gotten that job"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"moving to New York"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"Right. No chilis!"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"Flea's an Australian guy!"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Yeah, maybe there's an Australian dude named"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Michael Balzari"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"And there's no chilis! Not yet, Frusciante"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"might have just ended up in some like"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"random indie rock band"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Kiedis, who knows?"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Those solo records!"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"Maybe, but no, they really had to come together"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"and one thing that's interesting about Pearl Jam is"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"oh sorry, the Red Hot Chili Peppers"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"who do share something in common"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"with Pearl Jam, they've had"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"at various points, they've had the same drummer, Jack"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"Irons, who Flea met"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"at middle school in Hollywood"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"in the 70s, but"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"one cool thing about the Chili Peppers"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"and maybe that's where this whole thing"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"is heading, is that don't worry"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"about Motley Crue vs. Pearl Jam"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"they're two sides of the same coin"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"just listen to the Chili Peppers"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"they got a little bit of that classic rock"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"machismo"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"showbiz stuff, but they also got that kind of sensitive"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"90s sh*t"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"maybe Chili Peppers are the band"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"that can unite this, maybe Chad Smith should have"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"gotten up off the drums, walked to the front of the stage"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"taking the mic, said ""Eddie"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"come on man, let's squash this beef"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"maybe we'll get a new Temple of the Dog type"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"thing, except it's"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"Vince Neil"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"and Vedder"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"I mean off the back of the Pam and Tommy"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"buzz, get them all together"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"oh my god, I love that, Vince Neil takes"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"one verse, Vedder's"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"rich baritone, ""I don't"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"mind stealing bread"""
01:07:28;01:07:30;"and then Vince Neil's like"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"""I don't mind stealing bread!"""
01:07:32;01:07:34;"but like"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"so thin, not Chris Cornell"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"so thin"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"oh man"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"come on, let's make this happen"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"""I don't mind"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"stealing bread"

01:10:42;01:10:44;"at home or even in the car"

01:11:06;01:11:08;"1992?"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Come on I thought we had"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"outgrown that period"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"and it really is funny yeah this idea of"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"the chili peppers as being the bridge"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"I was thinking about it being in this big chili"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"pepper zone lately that"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Kiedis as a front man"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"obviously they had two different sides"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"and you know we were"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"listening to Under the Bridge"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"in the car and I was just like"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"God what a beautiful song"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I've said this on the show before but definitely"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"one of the to me I don't know how you feel Jake"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"I think one of the best"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"rock singles of the 90s"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"Okay I'm not gonna fight you on it"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"I dig it I mean the guitar work"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"is incredible that's my favorite"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"part but even Kiedis I have like"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"a lot of people no he's good"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"people clown him as a"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"lyricist cause he can sometimes get into his"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"wild stuff but it's like he's so"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"original and"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"totally on the new song there's a line"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"about sailing on the censorship"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"and I was like you know what"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"from Kiedis I buy it"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"and also just when he like when he wants"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"to he hits it like so perfectly"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"just like when you really just think"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"about the opening of that song"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"sometimes I feel like"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"I don't have a partner"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"it's like it's just perfect"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"simple it's emotional"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"but anyway I was watching the video"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"for Under the Bridge he's"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"such a funny character because it's like"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"he's walking down the street and"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"his like DOA punk rock shirt"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"kind of like interacting with like"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"dudes downtown just like selling"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"like stuff and you're looking"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"at him you're like he has kind of"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"long hair so he's a little"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"bit had one foot in the 80s cause they started"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"in the 80s but then the song itself"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"is so 90s"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"and then it ends with that just shot of him"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"running on the beach and he's like so jacked"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"and he has long hair and you're like"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"physically he's like in the lineage"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"of like Danzig or something"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"like he's not a"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Cobain or a Vetter kind of like"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"sensitive meek dude although clearly he's very sensitive"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"he has a deep well of emotion"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"as a lyricist and a singer"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"but just like him running down the beach in slow-mo"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"like super jacked as I was watching"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"I had this thought popped into my head"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"I was like what did Kurt Cobain think"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"of this because I famously"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"all three bands toured together Pearl Jam"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"and I wonder if like"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"Kurt heard a song like Under the Bridge and he was like"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"absolutely beautiful or if he's watching"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"the video and just sees like jacked"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Anthony Kiedis running towards him"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"also very aware that another single"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"from that album is called"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Suck My Kiss"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"like Kurt's trying to listen to Blood Sugar Sex Mad"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"and Kiedis is your mouth was made to suck"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"my kiss was Kurt just like"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"no way man Kiedis is a jock"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"I'm not down like oh"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"absolutely you think there's no way"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Kurt Cobain liked Jilly's"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"absolutely but Eddie Vetter did"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"I think there's something about being"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"health forward caring about"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"your body staying"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"swole working out and being"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"emotional it's like that is"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"both the Motley crew"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"you know what I mean it's like those guys"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"it's proto Rogan dude"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"but it's staying swole"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"I think that there's"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"something about yeah it's like you look at those"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"you know alternative Seattle bands"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"like they're not hitting the gym but that doesn't"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"mean that you can't do it's literally the"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"transition from you know"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"that 80s and 90s like"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"they're perfect for it yeah I mean you"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"could have pictured a Motley crew video"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"with"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"horny and"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"insensitive exactly you could"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"picture a Motley crew video with"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Vince Neil running down the beach"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"shirtless with his blonde flowing"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"locks with a bunch of like bikini girls"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"absolutely it's hard to"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"picture just an austere shot of just"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Vince Neil by himself"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"that's the difference yeah"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"your mouth was made to suck my"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"kiss well I'm"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"sailing"

01:15:18;01:15:20;"why does everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser"
01:15:20;01:15:24;"just an amazing thing okay you know what I'll"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"say and actually it's not hard to picture"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"like the chili peppers"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"hating on Motley crew I could"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"totally picture that too it's like"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"1988 Flea and Kiedis"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"are like in some weird apartment in"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"East Hollywood and"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"just like watching MTV and like and"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Girls Girls Girls comes up and Flea's just like"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"this sucks man and Kiedis is like"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"terrible I'm not saying that they"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"would like it but yeah one thing"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"about the chili peppers is"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"there's there's really like very little"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"it's just like full of contradiction"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"they bridge the binaries"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"you know so you like you said like kind of"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"horny and sensitive but also like"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"when you listen to that music"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"they're clearly not just rock"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"dudes those are clearly dudes who are just like"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"oh f**k yeah"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"George Clinton, Black Flag"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"f**king Led Zeppelin"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"this s**t rocks like those are dudes who have such"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"enthusiasm you could picture them listening to"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"like funk, rap"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"like heavy metal"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"and through all of it just being like"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"this rules in the same way that"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"this kind of binary of like"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Pearl Jam meant the end of hair metal"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"the chili peppers just are kind of"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"weirdly you can't box"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"them in. Yeah no you're totally right"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"and yeah with Pearl Jam and with Motley Crue"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"neither band has any funk"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"right those bands are just like"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"straight down the middle rock"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"kind of prosaic honestly I mean I prefer"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Pearl Jam but like"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"the musicianship in the Chili's is like"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"so much more interesting. Yeah they're"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"also like they transcend"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"genre in"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I'm not saying for the listener they transcend"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"genre like they have a sound but I think"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"I get the impression especially having"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"read multiple memoirs"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"by members of the Chili Peppers"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"they're dudes who just like"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"they love like the spirit of something"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"like you know like there's some"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"people who just say like might just say"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"something rules if they like it"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"there's some people who call something hard"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"if they think it's like cool"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"goes hard man"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"and I've just met people just like"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"you could listen to something that most people"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"describe as hard like a hard"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"rock band or like a really like"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"funky intense groove"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"and somebody like that's hard and you just"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"play something else that's like cool even if"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"it's like very soft and beautiful and they might be like"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"that's hard you know because it's like there's"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"like a spirit that goes above the"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"it's like it's on a different plane"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"than the actual"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"signifiers of what you're listening to"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"you know just like the same way that like"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"you can find funkiness"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"in like very"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"funky music like famously"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"Kraftwerk is like funky in their own"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"weird way anyway that's like"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"some Chili Peppers type vibe"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"before we listen to their new song"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"just throw on the song um"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Breaking the Girl because this is very"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"interesting to me and we've talked about this before but"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"late 1991 is so crazy"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"because within a period of two months"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Pearl Jam 10"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Nirvana Nevermind and Blood Sugar Sex"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"Magic come out these records came out"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"at the exact same time"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"and I was thinking about Herm Yarl because I was listening to"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Breaking the Girl and you were like"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Kiedis is kind of doing like a grunge thing"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"but it's like too early Pearl Jam"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"wasn't big yet yeah we've forgotten about"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"Kiedis and the Herm Yarl"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"the Herm Yarl verse we did man"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"throw it on we forgot about Kiedis"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"to an extent there was definitely like a"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"zeitgeist for sure"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"it doesn't all stem from better"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"I love the"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"production on this this is a great song"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"it's like a little bit of Yarl"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"there it is"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"this is also like so 70s"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"this song yeah"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"I mean I was thinking"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"like with the flutes I mean it reminds me of Zeppelin"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"a little bit yeah"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"like something off like"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"Zeppelin 3 or something"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"I think this is my favorite"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Chili Peppers song oh really"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"I think so I mean I love"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"the like sensitive ballad stuff I love"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"old squeeze I love"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"the other song on this record"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"I could have lied"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"That real quiet acoustic ballad."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"Raised by my dad"
01:20:18;01:20:22;"Good luck the day"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"He was my man"
01:20:26;01:20:30;"That was the way"
01:20:30;01:20:34;"She was a girl"
01:20:34;01:20:38;"Left alone"
01:20:38;01:20:42;"Feeling no need"
01:20:42;01:20:46;"To make me whole"
01:20:46;01:20:53;"It made me think about, especially because Vetter has always been on record as having been a massive Chili Peppers fan."
01:20:53;01:21:01;"I don't really hear it in the music, but apparently he was like going to Chili Peppers shows in the mid 80s and being like, ""This band rules. I love these guys."""
01:21:01;01:21:06;"You know, shout out to him. He called it before they were like an international phenomenon."
01:21:06;01:21:14;"So then you kind of, you listen to that and you're like, ""Okay, this record came out the exact same time as 10, so it's not like Kiedis was influenced by Vetter."""
01:21:14;01:21:18;"Is Kiedis in some ways the originator of Hermiare?"
01:21:18;01:21:24;"And people forget about it because when people picture Kiedis, they think about, ""Why does everyone, you know, give it away?"""
01:21:24;01:21:25;"They think about the rapping."
01:21:25;01:21:28;"Yeah. Scattily dap, doobie dap."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"Let's throw on the new song, ""Black Summer."""
01:21:40;01:21:56;"A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry, cremation takes its piece of your supply."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"This is trippy."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"There's a real Irish moment coming up."
01:22:00;01:22:08;"The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"A sailor."
01:22:10;01:22:13;"And Jane is on the dark side of the moon."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"The dark side of the moon."
01:22:19;01:22:26;"Oh, give me that fresante."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Doing his best Jimmy there."
01:22:27;01:22:43;"The caterpillars are a few, the secret life of rue, a personality I never knew."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"Get it on."
01:22:45;01:22:52;"My great old wizard tongue, the archers on the run."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"But he was so brilliant."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"You know what?"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"You know, fair play convention or something."
01:22:56;01:22:59;"Very Dylan-y just to be like, new accent."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Totally."
01:23:01;01:23:14;"It's been a long time since I made a new friend, waiting on another black summer to end."
01:23:14;01:23:18;"It's been a long time and you never know when."
01:23:18;01:23:21;"I also love your big chorus."
01:23:21;01:23:25;"The only new element is some frusciante backing vocals."
01:23:25;01:23:32;"Like, you know, in modern rock production, you could put in like a giant synth pad, add some like new drums."
01:23:32;01:23:38;"But it's like, it really is just like more or less three instruments and vocals."
01:23:38;01:23:41;"Yeah, it's just that backing vocal that comes in to distinguish."
01:23:41;01:23:45;"And also, they left a lot of room for a solo."
01:23:45;01:23:49;"I love the move of just going straight to a solo after the first chorus."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"Yeah."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Sailing on a censorship."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Have you done a deep dive on these lyrics?"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"I only checked that one because I was listening to it and I was like, did he say sailing on a censorship?"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"And then I looked it up and I was like, oh yeah, sick."
01:24:47;01:24:52;"I've been waiting, I've been waiting."
01:24:52;01:24:56;"Waiting on another black summer to end."
01:24:56;01:24:59;"I've been waiting, I've been waiting."
01:24:59;01:25:03;"Is this like a COVID song? Like a quarantine song?"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Oh, that's interesting."
01:25:05;01:25:13;"Yeah, I think there's a little bit of like a climate change thing where in the beginning he said, the skies refused to cry."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Right."
01:25:20;01:25:23;"I also like totally, I totally like buy it."
01:25:23;01:25:33;"I think sometimes it's hard for people in certain genres such as rock to like know what they're trying to express when they're like 59 years old, you know?"
01:25:33;01:25:44;"And there is something where I'm like, I could just like picture Kiedis on like some weird, way too hot summer day in LA just looking out just being like, and like feeling
like this song."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Oh yeah."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"Can we just throw on one more Chili Peppers song?"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Please."
01:25:49;01:25:57;"This is one that I heard recently. It's on By The Way, which is their album from 2002."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"And it's called Universally Speaking. This is track two."
01:26:00;01:26:06;"And I kind of forgot about this. So and I kind of realized like, Chili Peppers have always kind of done their own thing."
01:26:06;01:26:10;"They've had a sound basically since the early 90s."
01:26:10;01:26:22;"But this song is kind of interesting because it's like, it's like they were doing a little nod to like, the new rock music of the early 2000s, like the strokes and the kind
of like, slightly retro stuff."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Throw this one on. I hadn't heard it in years."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"You've never heard this?"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"No, it's very stroke so you're right."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"I would not have guessed this was the Chili Peppers just from his opening."
01:26:52;01:26:56;"There's also doing chewing Casablanca's singing."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Kind of, yeah."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"A little."
01:26:58;01:27:02;"Oh no, tell everything about this. Like he could have come in."
01:27:02;01:27:06;"But you know what? You know what I'll say? It works."
01:27:06;01:27:11;"Yeah, they can do strokes. I don't know. Can strokes do Chili Peppers? I don't know."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"No, hell no."
01:27:24;01:27:33;"I was in a bar and was like hanging out with people and this was on like, the background. I'd be like, is this the strokes song I don't know?"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Nice backing vocals here."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Versace is like, oh let me take one guys."
01:28:45;01:28:50;"You know sometimes a band does like somebody else's style and it's like awkward."
01:28:50;01:28:57;"What I like about this song is like if somebody said, it's the type of thing if you described it, it would sound pretty good but very few people could deliver."
01:28:57;01:29:07;"If you're like, okay, imagine it's like, it's like an early stroke song except it's done by like, like the Chili Peppers, like dudes who surf and hang out on the beach."
01:29:07;01:29:14;"It has like a little, it's like a little slower. It's like a SoCal strokes, but it's still like kind of cool."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"This is what it would actually sound like."
01:29:16;01:29:25;"Yeah. No, I love this, this sub genre of when bands do like a song in another genre credibly."
01:29:25;01:29:33;"Like I'm thinking of the Hollies doing Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress, which for the longest time was like, is this a Creedence song?"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Right."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"You know that one?"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"Yeah, it's very different than like, they're kind of like pretty."
01:29:39;01:29:45;"Yeah. There's a Kiss song called Hard Luck Woman that sounds exactly like Rod Stewart."
01:29:45;01:29:48;"That'd be a funny playlist. I'd have to crowdsource that."
01:29:48;01:30:00;"Or even you could say like, like Queen doing like, Another One Bites the Dust, where they're just like, let's do kind of like a, like a chic song."
01:30:00;01:30:03;"And then they just do it and like, they kind of do it perfectly."
01:30:03;01:30:07;"It's like, that's what Queen should sound like doing a chic song."
01:30:07;01:30:08;"Yeah."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"All right. Universally speaking."
01:30:36;01:30:41;"DJ mode. That was universally speaking by the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
01:30:41;01:30:42;"That was the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"John Frusciante on record saying he hated that mix."
01:30:45;01:30:47;"Frusciante said he hated the mix?"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Hated it. Hated the way it was mixed."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Well, they took a solo out."
01:30:51;01:30:53;"I wonder how he wanted it to be mixed."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Frusciante was not staying Switzerland."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"He did not stay Switzerland."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"Chad Smith didn't like the mix either, but he kept his mouth shut."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"All right, let's get in the top five."
01:31:02;01:31:09;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:31:09;01:31:16;"Now, the top five is a little random today because maybe real quick we can lead into it."
01:31:16;01:31:20;"People might remember a few episodes ago, kind of out of nowhere,"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"Jake dropped a scorching hot take that we'd never heard before on this program,"
01:31:24;01:31:29;"which is that Jake doesn't like, Borderline hates Nine Inch Nails."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"[Explosion]"
01:31:31;01:31:36;"It's true. I mean, you know, I'm not going to start lecturing Trent Reznor on his views on feminism,"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"but I maybe feel the way that Eddie Vedder feels about Motley Crue."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"He's not a fan. Well, that's the thing."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"Sometimes you just got to say you're not a fan."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"And it stops there."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"It stops there."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"I don't like the way the music makes me feel."
01:31:49;01:31:52;"I don't like the aesthetic. That's it."
01:31:52;01:31:59;"It's not that deep, but we did get a very impassioned letter from a fan named Angus."
01:31:59;01:32:03;"He described himself as a 35-year-old man in stocks and socks."
01:32:03;01:32:06;"He's been listening since day one from Melbourne, Australia."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"That's where Flea's from."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"Shout out to Angus."
01:32:08;01:32:13;"When he heard Jake say that Nine Inch Nails sucks, he was shaken to his core."
01:32:13;01:32:17;"He wrote, ""It caused me to rip my headphones from my cranium and begin writing this email."
01:32:17;01:32:20;"My first ever correspondence after nearly seven years of listening."""
01:32:20;01:32:23;"Wait, have we been doing this for seven years?"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"Yeah, 15."
01:32:24;01:32:25;"We've covered this."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"Yes."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"I know, but--"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"We've covered this every other show."
01:32:28;01:32:29;"I know."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"The show started in 2015."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"I know. It's upsetting."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Time flies."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"It doesn't cease to be upsetting hearing it."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"All right, go back to the thing."
01:32:38;01:32:43;"I mean, this is like a classic time crisis topic, time and its crises."
01:32:43;01:32:50;"But I was watching the movie Ice Age, which is like a children's film."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"I was watching it with my child."
01:32:52;01:32:55;"And there's something about children's movies,"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"especially if you're our age, like silverback millennial,"
01:32:58;01:33:02;"or in the case of Jake, straight up Gen X,"
01:33:02;01:33:10;"I always felt like I was too old to care when they started making lots of computer animated feature films."
01:33:10;01:33:14;"Because by then I was like, I don't know, I was like 11, 12."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"I just didn't care anymore."
01:33:16;01:33:21;"I've seen some of them, and I understand where people love Pixar or whatever."
01:33:21;01:33:27;"But as far as I'm concerned, any movie made after Toy Story is like the new movie."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"It's such a line in the sand."
01:33:29;01:33:34;"Because I remember being a kid when The Lion King came out,"
01:33:34;01:33:38;"kind of like the last golden era of 2D animation."
01:33:38;01:33:43;"And then already there's something about by the time you're 16 or 17,"
01:33:43;01:33:49;"children's movies come out, you don't have the same sense of when they came out,"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"because you're so checked out from it."
01:33:51;01:33:56;"Anyway, I just had this funny thing, browsing some movies to watch,"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"and my son wanted to watch that one, and I threw it on."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"I'm like, all right, Ice Age."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"Yeah, I know this is a big thing."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"They made lots of these."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"I'm like, all right, let's throw on the first Ice Age."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"And then I just look, and it's from 2002."
01:34:07;01:34:11;"And I was like, that's hilarious that this movie is 20 years old."
01:34:11;01:34:17;"The film Ice Age is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year."
01:34:17;01:34:20;"And to me, I don't know when I would have thought it came out,"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"but it's just one of those things where I'm like, Ice Age,"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"that's some new [expletive]"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"I would have guessed 2012."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"That's insane."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"There's a 10-year-old who went to the theater and saw Ice Age"
01:34:29;01:34:30;"when it was in theaters."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"That person is 30 now."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Time flies."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Oh my God."
01:34:35;01:34:39;"Anyway, this dude, he says, ""It might not be to your liking,"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"but your apparent revulsion caused me some concern."""
01:34:42;01:34:46;"And he says, ""Yes, the lyrics are extremely self-serious, not at all fun,"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"but kind of the point."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"It isn't supposed to be fun."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"It's supposed to capture a very specific mood"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"and distill into something that's at once violent and beautiful."
01:34:53;01:34:58;"Just typing those words, I can see Jake's face curling into a ball of cringe."""
01:34:58;01:35:00;"I like that this guy knows his audience."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"He's making the case, but he's like,"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"I know that's not going to resonate with Jake."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"Like, there's no version where a dude sends an email saying,"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"""Jake, I really think you got to reconsider Nine Inch Nails."""
01:35:10;01:35:15;"What Trent does with those lyrics is he distills it into something"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"both violent and beautiful."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"He knows that's not going to resonate with Jake."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"There's no way Jake's going to be like,"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"""Honestly, bro, I never thought about it that way."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"I'm going to throw that sh*t out."
01:35:23;01:35:26;"I'm going to throw the fragile on and really think deeply about this."""
01:35:26;01:35:30;"Anyway, so he says, ""He knows that your face is probably turning into a ball of cringe,"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"but he's got to rep his man, TR."""
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Trent Reznor."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"And he also says, ""They're one of the all-time great live acts."""
01:35:37;01:35:38;"Well, that's interesting."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"I don't really know much about their live show."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"And he put together a playlist, five songs."
01:35:43;01:35:44;"-Respect."
01:35:44;01:35:46;"-And just so anybody else listening,"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"we're not going to listen to them on air right now."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"Maybe we will one day, but anybody who's interested,"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"we'll just give you the first three songs that he put on the playlist."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"""All the Love in the World"" from 2005."
01:35:57;01:36:01;"He describes it as a song that becomes goth disco by the end."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"Then ""The Big Come Down"" from 1999."
01:36:04;01:36:08;"He says it has some of that Janet Jackson vibe we talked about."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"-I was thinking as you were talking, I was like,"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"""Where the lineage of Nine Inch Nails, Motley Crue, Alt-Rock."""
01:36:14;01:36:17;"I was like, ""Oh, it seems like there's probably--"
01:36:17;01:36:20;"Nine Inch Nails is closer to Motley Crue"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"than they would be to Pearl Jam, Eddie Vedder."""
01:36:23;01:36:24;"You know what I mean?"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Would you agree?"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"-No."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"-Well, let me tell you something."
01:36:29;01:36:33;"is the downward spiral when he brought two porn stars"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"and some grapes to the studio and mucked them up."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"The rest is history."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"-Whoa."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"[laughs]"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"-Yeah, I mean, you're right."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"Nine Inch Nails has a little bit in common with both."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"I feel like I was reading something once that"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"Trent Reznor in the heyday of Nine Inch Nails"
01:36:48;01:36:52;"recorded an album at Sharon Tate's house,"
01:36:52;01:36:55;"the Cielo Drive infamous Madsen house."
01:36:55;01:37:01;"I think later maybe Sharon Tate's family talked to him"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"or he felt embarrassed and he's like,"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"""Yeah, that was some shock jock."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"[beep]"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"I'm embarrassed by that."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"It's not that cool."""
01:37:07;01:37:11;"But in a sense, that is a little closer to hair metal"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"than it is to Eddie Vedder."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"That's on some just like--"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"-True."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"-Oh, hell yeah, man."
01:37:16;01:37:18;"We're sick and twisted."
01:37:18;01:37:22;"-He was trying to do maybe his version of Jimmy Page,"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"getting really into Aleister Crowley and buying that house"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"and living there."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"He was into that mythology."
01:37:30;01:37:34;"To me, Nine Inch Nails was sort of like proto-Marilyn Manson"
01:37:34;01:37:40;"where it's sort of like very try-hard, gothy, moody aesthetic"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"that isn't backed up with good music."
01:37:43;01:37:46;"Now, I understand that Trent Reznor is--"
01:37:46;01:37:49;"I think Trent Reznor is a much more interesting artist"
01:37:49;01:37:52;"than Marilyn Manson, who I think is just terrible."
01:37:52;01:37:55;"But they're on the similar continuum."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"-Anyway, we're not going to--"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"Knowing that Jake is--"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"-We don't need to listen to five Nine Inch Nails songs."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"-Yeah, Jake, you need to check these songs out privately."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"-Not even for the show."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Not even for the content could you put yourself through that."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"-I also feel bad."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"This dude, Angus, long-time listener,"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"he took the time to make this playlist."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"Jake, you really should listen to it privately."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"-I'll post it. I'll post it."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"-But I won't listen to it."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"-Oh, absolutely not."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"-This guy worked hard."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"He knows that it's an uphill battle convincing you."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"-I respect it. I love it."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"-So, yeah, we don't need to listen to it on air"
01:38:27;01:38:30;"and Jake say, ""Nah, I'm not feeling it,"""
01:38:30;01:38:32;"listening to it through FaceTime."
01:38:32;01:38:36;"-Look, I saw that we got some Paula Abdul coming up in the top five."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"I'd much rather listen to that."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"-So let's get into this."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Today, we're going to just do straight up"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"the top five songs this week in 1989."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Why 1989?"
01:38:44;01:38:48;"Because that's the year that Nine Inch Nails' first album,"
01:38:48;01:38:51;"Pretty Hate Machine, hit the stores."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"The number five song--"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"-There you go."
01:38:54;01:38:55;"-So picture this."
01:38:55;01:38:59;"It's 1989 and this is the milieu,"
01:38:59;01:39:04;"the cultural milieu that Nine Inch Nails was entering."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"The number five song, Sheena Easton, ""The Lover in Me."""
01:39:14;01:39:15;"-Wow."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"-Very '89."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"-I mean, such a distinct palette."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"-Yeah."
01:39:28;01:39:31;"-A lot of pork stabs."
01:39:31;01:39:34;"-Yeah, it's so '88, '89."
01:39:34;01:39:39;"-By the way, this year is also '89,"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"the year Motley Crue released Dr. Feel Good,"
01:39:41;01:39:44;"their best-selling and only number one album."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"It's also the year--"
01:39:47;01:39:53;"the last year that the Cincinnati Bengals made the Super Bowl before 2022."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"-Wow."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"-It's really sort of cosmically aligning."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"-I owned the Dr. Feel Good album on tape."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"-Oh, really?"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"So why are you aiding so much?"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"-You're a fan."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"-I was a fan."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"I loved the Dr. Feel Good album."
01:40:12;01:40:15;"-That album kind of ripped in '89."
01:40:44;01:41:03;"-All right, this is like some great '89 post-Janet Jackson, Prince-type [expletive]"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"-Yeah."
01:41:04;01:41:07;"-Prince is listed as a producer on this."
01:41:07;01:41:10;"The number four song this week in 1989,"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"Debbie Gibson, Lost in Your Eyes."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"One interesting thing about this,"
01:41:21;01:41:25;"Debbie Gibson, she was writing and producing all her own music,"
01:41:25;01:41:28;"which is--I feel like we talked about this years ago."
01:41:28;01:41:32;"There's so few people who write and produce their own hit singles."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"Obviously, there's many people who write and produce their own music, but--"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"-Yeah."
01:41:36;01:41:41;"-She set a Billboard record in '87 with Foolish Beat."
01:41:41;01:41:44;"She was the youngest person to write, produce, and record a number one single"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"entirely on their own."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"She was 17."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"Now, maybe Soulja Boy beat her with Crank That,"
01:41:51;01:41:54;"because I know he wrote and produced that song."
01:42:04;01:42:07;"-Yeah, she's the sole songwriter and sole producer credited."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"This really reminds me of Eric Carman or something."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"-Yeah."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"-Deep power ballad."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Gibson, along with Bruce Springsteen,"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"were named the ASCAP Songwriters of the Year in '89."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Not for Bruce."
01:42:20;01:42:23;"-Yeah, '89 is not a classic Bruce year."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"-Yeah."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"I mean, what did he put out in '89?"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"I can't think of anything."
01:42:28;01:42:31;"He did Tunnel of Love in '87."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"-Human Touch is like '90?"
01:42:33;01:42:36;"I think it's like '91, '92."
01:42:36;01:42:40;"Maybe it was retrospectively for Tunnel of Love or something."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Weird."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"-Okay, not a very exciting song,"
01:42:55;01:43:02;"but still props for writing and producing it on your own, Debbie Gibson."
01:43:02;01:43:05;"-It's also funny, this could be any time in the '80s."
01:43:05;01:43:09;"This could be '80, '81."
01:43:09;01:43:14;"-That snare is a little severe, but yes, the songwriting for sure."
01:43:14;01:43:17;"I mean, this could have been written in the mid-'70s,"
01:43:17;01:43:20;"and it could have been a Bette Midler single or something."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"-Yeah."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"That's cool that she produced it."
01:43:24;01:43:29;"The number three song this week in 1989, Bon Jovi."
01:43:29;01:43:32;"We've talked about Bon Jovi very little."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"I've always wanted to know more about Bon Jovi"
01:43:34;01:43:40;"because I know this album that it's on is straight up called New Jersey."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"-Oh, I didn't know that. Wow."
01:43:41;01:43:45;"-Yeah, there's a big Bon Jovi album that's straight up called New Jersey."
01:43:45;01:43:51;"It was funny, I'd see that record and think about the classic, stark, acoustic"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"Bruce Springsteen album Nebraska."
01:43:54;01:43:58;"You could just picture Bon Jovi and Richie Sambore just being like,"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"""Why is he making an album called Nebraska?"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Come on, Bruce, you're from New Jersey."
01:44:02;01:44:05;"We should make an album called New Jersey. Come on."""
01:44:05;01:44:10;"-The perfect difference between the artists is Bruce is like,"
01:44:10;01:44:15;"he knows that it's weirder and cooler to write a song called Nebraska"
01:44:15;01:44:22;"and write about badlands and serial killers and corrupt cops and stuff."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"-Then just Bon Jovi and Richie Sambore just be like,"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"""Who gives a [expletive] to call the album New Jersey?"""
01:44:26;01:44:28;"-Come on, have some tri-state pride."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"-Come on, man."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"I don't think I know this song, Born to Be My Baby."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"-Oh, you know this song, dude."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"-Okay, throw it on."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"-Two, three, four!"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"-This is actually very Bruce."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"I could see someone thinking this was Bruce."
01:45:02;01:45:08;"If you were a 15-year-old kid and your dad listens to Bruce"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"and then you heard this, you're like, ""Is this Bruce?"""
01:45:10;01:45:14;"-Right, you're not that familiar with the vibe."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"You're just close enough."
01:45:41;01:45:44;"-Honestly, this almost could have been on the river."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"-Yeah, if you picture Bruce singing it,"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"tone down the production."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"-Totally."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"-I have this memory of--"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"I would be seven years old, I guess,"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"and I was in the record store by my house"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"and seeing Slippery When Wet, which is the thing."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"-Sure, yeah."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"-Probably the first time in my life, like,"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"[Bleep] dirty."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Like, it's my first time, like, understanding sort of pun."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Like, a sexual euphemism."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"-Oh, Slippery When Wet."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"-Do you know what I mean?"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Just being like, ""Oh."""
01:46:51;01:46:53;"And that's when I-- because Matt wrote me,"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"and he goes, ""This is awful. I hate this."""
01:46:55;01:46:58;"Like, I hate Bon Jovi, and I have this very warm--"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"I have a warm place in my--"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"-Wait, Matt wrote just to Nick?"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"-Just me."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"I was just like, ""I hate this."""
01:47:03;01:47:04;"-Wait."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"-But everybody likes--"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"-Matt rarely jumps on the mic, but--"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"-Everybody likes living on a prayer."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"-Why did you write just to Nick?"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"-Well, Matt and I write back and forth"
01:47:13;01:47:16;"the same with Seinfeld and him."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"If he finds any-- like, if he's doing"
01:47:18;01:47:21;"any sort of personal number crunching of his own"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"and thinks there's something that one of us could chime in,"
