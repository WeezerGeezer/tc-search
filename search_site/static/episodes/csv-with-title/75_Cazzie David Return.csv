00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:05;"It's the dog days of summer."
00:05;00:08;"A sweet chilly heat engulfs the world."
00:08;00:11;"Here in Time Crisis we're trying to keep cool"
00:11;00:14;"by talking about the songs of the summer,"
00:14;00:17;"catching up with Kazzy David,"
00:17;00:21;"and riffing on topics ranging from Frosted Flakes"
00:21;00:24;"to the Grateful Dead, I assume."
00:24;00:29;"This is Time Crisis with Eds Rukin."
00:29;00:33;"P-P-P-P-P-Peaceful World One."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:39;00:46;"The war I felt, war being me, all my rightful chances."
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:11;01:15;"Keep it on me babe."
01:15;01:18;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:18;01:20;"It's the dog days of summer right now."
01:20;01:21;"Yeah, we're in it."
01:21;01:23;"The world is on fire."
01:23;01:25;"Real global heat wave this summer."
01:25;01:27;"Yeah, we touched on that last episode."
01:27;01:29;"It's like a haunting phrase."
01:29;01:30;"Global heat wave."
01:30;01:32;"I just crushed a breakfast burrito"
01:32;01:34;"from the company cafeteria."
01:34;01:36;"Yeah, Jake's been checking out,"
01:36;01:38;"exploring a little more of the Apple campus"
01:38;01:40;"here in Culver City."
01:40;01:42;"Well, we're doing a morning taping."
01:42;01:44;"Right, this time we're actually taping in the morning."
01:44;01:45;"Full disclosure."
01:45;01:46;"This one's a little early."
01:46;01:47;"Yeah, a little early."
01:47;01:49;"Lately I've been trying not to eat breakfast."
01:49;01:50;"Why?"
01:50;01:52;"Because I've been intermittent fasting."
01:52;01:54;"Oh, how long? 16 hours?"
01:54;01:56;"Yeah, so because I snack late at night,"
01:56;02:00;"that means I can't eat lunch until like 2 or 3."
02:00;02:02;"So you eat nothing until 2 or 3?"
02:02;02:04;"Some days, not every day."
02:04;02:05;"Okay, so it's like a 2 to 10."
02:05;02:07;"The thing I can't figure out is that"
02:07;02:09;"the only times in my life where I felt like I was like,"
02:09;02:12;"I really felt like I had a lot of clarity,"
02:12;02:17;"mental acuity, and I was like kind of powerful,"
02:17;02:20;"a little less chubby, was when I would actually"
02:20;02:22;"actively try to have periods of not eating."
02:22;02:24;"By the way, I'm not recommending anything."
02:24;02:26;"I'm just talking about my journey."
02:26;02:27;"Right."
02:27;02:29;"One of the first times I went on tour with your brother"
02:29;02:30;"on a Dirty Projectors tour,"
02:30;02:32;"I feel like it wasn't the one with you."
02:32;02:34;"I just remember being like,"
02:34;02:37;"okay, every day I'm in the car for like 7 hours."
02:37;02:39;"And I weirdly got this thing in my head where I was like,"
02:39;02:42;"I'm going to see how much I can fast on this tour."
02:42;02:44;"I remember a few times just like being at Denny's"
02:44;02:46;"with like Dave and whoever,"
02:46;02:49;"like getting ready to drive from Oklahoma"
02:49;02:52;"to West Texas or something,"
02:52;02:54;"and just be like people just like housing"
02:54;02:55;"like Denny's scrambles and really,"
02:55;02:56;"you guys aren't hungry?"
02:56;02:57;"And I'd be like, no, I'm not hungry."
02:57;02:59;"James Sumner eating two entrees."
02:59;03:00;"Yeah, exactly."
03:00;03:03;"There was a guy in the crew who literally ate double everything."
03:03;03:04;"And so I don't know."
03:04;03:06;"I just feel like as much as I love breakfast food,"
03:06;03:08;"maybe I just got to try to not eat."
03:08;03:09;"Because here's the thing,"
03:09;03:11;"I can't cut myself off at the end of the day."
03:11;03:12;"That's too hard."
03:12;03:13;"See, that's what I do."
03:13;03:15;"You can just cut yourself off at the end of the day."
03:15;03:17;"I usually go to bed mildly hungry."
03:17;03:19;"It's like Karl Lagerfeld."
03:19;03:20;"Is that what his diet is?"
03:20;03:21;"He doesn't eat after 7 p.m."
03:21;03:22;"Oh, wow."
03:22;03:25;"Yeah, I try to like load all the calories"
03:25;03:27;"first chunk of the day."
03:27;03:29;"So I just crush this huge breakfast burrito."
03:29;03:31;"Yeah, I'm sure that makes more sense."
03:31;03:32;"I'll eat some like almonds and stuff,"
03:32;03:34;"some carrots and hummus this afternoon."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:37;"And then just like a dinner at like 7,"
03:37;03:38;"but like chill."
03:38;03:39;"A reasonable dinner."
03:39;03:41;"Sometimes I go big at dinner, but you know."
03:41;03:43;"Chicken breast, some steamed broccoli."
03:43;03:45;"That's a little clinical."
03:45;03:46;"I'm not really sure."
03:46;03:48;"I haven't thought that far ahead."
03:48;03:49;"There's a lot of people in this world"
03:49;03:51;"who all they eat for every meal"
03:51;03:53;"is chicken breast and steamed vegetables."
03:53;03:54;"Yeah, that's crazy."
03:54;03:55;"That's a lifestyle."
03:55;03:56;"Yeah."
03:56;03:58;"Definitely lose weight that way."
03:58;04:01;"You should try like a week-long fast."
04:01;04:02;"What, no food?"
04:02;04:03;"Yeah."
04:03;04:04;"A friend of mine did it."
04:04;04:05;"It's actually not."
04:05;04:06;"Is that healthy?"
04:06;04:07;"Yeah, I think it's fine."
04:07;04:10;"I mean, like he would drink green tea"
04:10;04:12;"because he's like a coffee addict."
04:12;04:16;"So the green tea would mitigate the caffeine withdrawal."
04:16;04:18;"You know, that's also why it's easy for me"
04:18;04:20;"not to eat for the first five hours of the day"
04:20;04:23;"is because I'll crush one coffee, feel great."
04:23;04:24;"Two hours later, start to get hungry,"
04:24;04:26;"have another coffee, and then I'm good."
04:26;04:28;"Wow, that can backfire."
04:28;04:29;"Yeah, I don't know."
04:29;04:32;"The coffee with no food can be rough."
04:32;04:34;"Because you just get too high."
04:34;04:36;"But my buddy who fasted for a week,"
04:36;04:38;"he's like the first three days sucked."
04:38;04:39;"And then he's like day four,"
04:39;04:41;"it kicked into some other gear."
04:41;04:42;"So he was like, I started surfing a lot"
04:42;04:44;"day four, five, and six."
04:44;04:45;"That's crazy."
04:45;04:48;"Just like no food, surfing for like five hours."
04:48;04:49;"It's wild."
04:49;04:50;"And he's like, I didn't really lose that much weight."
04:50;04:52;"But I gained some neurons."
04:52;04:54;"Yeah, he's like my saliva changed."
04:54;04:56;"Like the flavor of my saliva changed."
04:56;04:57;"Interesting."
04:57;04:58;"And he's like--"
04:58;04:59;"Yeah, I'm sick of the flavor of my saliva."
04:59;05:02;"That could be like a weird product, couldn't it be?"
05:02;05:05;"Like saliva."
05:05;05:06;"Oh, yeah."
05:06;05:07;"Can you see that?"
05:07;05:09;"I remember there was some really like trashy candy"
05:09;05:10;"when I was a kid, probably still exists."
05:10;05:12;"It might have been made by the same people who made like"
05:12;05:14;"Warheads and those kind of like extreme candies."
05:14;05:15;"Oh, yeah, like nerds."
05:15;05:20;"It was like a little dropper of like sour liquid."
05:20;05:21;"Does this sound familiar to anybody?"
05:21;05:22;"Yeah."
05:22;05:24;"Like face explosion sour droppers."
05:24;05:26;"And it comes with like an eye dropper."
05:26;05:27;"Yeah, it was that kind of vibe."
05:27;05:28;"It was like pure chemical."
05:28;05:30;"We should market something like that."
05:30;05:32;"Also, this makes so much sense."
05:32;05:34;"It's kind of like there was a whole wave."
05:34;05:35;"This was after we were kids,"
05:35;05:38;"but there's been a whole wave of changing"
05:38;05:40;"the colors of products for kids."
05:40;05:42;"Like you're sick of red ketchup?"
05:42;05:43;"How about purple ketchup?"
05:43;05:45;"Oh, my God."
05:45;05:48;"Is your mom f*cking lame giving you red ketchup?"
05:48;05:50;"Why is the ketchup not green?"
05:50;05:52;"Every few years, somebody tries to drop a product"
05:52;05:54;"that's like, aren't you sick of water?"
05:54;05:57;"Drop this sh*t in the water, and the water will taste different."
05:57;05:59;"Or the water will be a more interesting color."
05:59;06:02;"I think you could totally market to kids."
06:02;06:05;"Just like every day you're forced to eat something all day."
06:05;06:07;"And we're not talking about grandma's Brussels sprouts."
06:07;06:09;"We're talking about saliva."
06:09;06:14;"Do you realize that you're literally eating your saliva all day, bro?"
06:14;06:15;"Eww."
06:15;06:16;"And what does it taste like?"
06:16;06:19;"It tastes like some weird chunky water."
06:19;06:23;"And then it's like, check out our new extreme saliva droppers."
06:23;06:27;"Or it could be like an injection that you get every six months."
06:27;06:31;"So it's like just permanent flavor."
06:31;06:33;"Permanent flavor."
06:33;06:35;"You got to write that down as a possible song title."
06:35;06:36;"Yeah, dude. Permanent flavor."
06:36;06:39;"Wait, can we talk about that? Or is that too private on there?"
06:39;06:40;"What's that?"
06:40;06:42;"That you have a master list of good song names."
06:42;06:44;"Oh yeah, no, that's not private."
06:44;06:46;"I think it might have been that same time when we were on"
06:46;06:48;"Shroom's Waiting in Line at the Dead show."
06:48;06:50;"Somebody just said something, and then you just were like,"
06:50;06:53;"""Oh yeah,"" and you took out your phone just to write down--"
06:53;06:54;"There's like a very specific style."
06:54;06:57;"They're kind of like GBV, pavement-y type thing."
06:57;06:59;"Yeah, theoretical tennis, maybe that was it."
06:59;07:00;"Nascent culture."
07:00;07:02;"Oh, it was nascent culture."
07:02;07:04;"Permanent flavor. Dogs dogma."
07:04;07:08;"No place to park it. Enjoy Nebraska. Wax pack gods."
07:08;07:10;"Oh, classically brutal."
07:10;07:14;"Oh yeah. Is the rule that they have to kind of come from a real conversation?"
07:14;07:16;"Yeah, it's just like something that catches your ear."
07:16;07:19;"Far-ranging bird. I'm in your system."
07:19;07:22;"Other shoppers. Classics. Take it deep."
07:22;07:24;"On this list, Sweet Chili Heat."
07:24;07:25;"Oh, wow."
07:25;07:26;"Anyway, do you ever do that?"
07:26;07:27;"Yeah, I write down all sorts--"
07:27;07:29;"I don't have a master list of song titles,"
07:29;07:31;"but I always write down little phrases and stuff."
07:31;07:33;"That just like catch your ear in conversation."

08:31;08:35;"Okay, but so it's an injection into your salivary glands."
08:35;08:37;"Maybe they do it at CVS."
08:37;08:41;"Mom and dad come, give the kid a flavor injection into their salivary glands."
08:41;08:43;"But the issue is you have to be able to turn it on and off"
08:43;08:45;"because you want to be able to eat--"
08:45;08:49;"if you have like a permanent grape flavor pumping through your salivary glands"
08:49;08:51;"and then you go eat Indian food or something, that's not going to work."
08:51;08:53;"So you have to be able to switch it off somehow."
08:53;08:56;"Want to switch off the twisted grape flavor?"
08:56;09:01;"Just reach your pointer finger into the back of your throat."
09:01;09:04;"That's like a Black Mirror vibe."
09:04;09:08;"Your parents control your salivary glands off their iPad."
09:08;09:10;"Got to be constantly entertained."
09:10;09:12;"Mom, I don't like broccoli."
09:12;09:14;"Mom switches on the flavor blasted bubblegum flavor."
09:14;09:16;"You're grounded."
09:16;09:19;"Oh, yeah, you're grounded, dude. Broccoli for a week."
09:19;09:23;"The parents are watching the kid on the CCTV inside the house."
09:23;09:24;"Just watching him on the iPad."
09:24;09:26;"What the f*ck is he doing?"
09:26;09:27;"He's going for the snack drawer."
09:27;09:29;"Oh, he's taking out a Butterfinger?"
09:29;09:32;"The little bastard switch bites into it."
09:32;09:34;"Tastes like grandma's brussel sprouts."
09:34;09:35;"Ew!"
09:35;09:36;"Got you."
09:36;09:37;"Over the intercom."
09:37;09:39;"Ew!"
09:39;09:41;"You could make everything that--"
09:41;09:44;"you could control your kid's salivary glands"
09:44;09:47;"and you make Butterfingers taste like grandma's brussel sprouts,"
09:47;09:50;"but grandma's brussel sprouts taste like Butterfingers."
09:50;09:51;"That's a treat."
09:51;09:53;"I guess it raises a larger question of"
09:53;09:57;"what would be the point besides punishment of inflicting the bad--"
09:57;10:00;"because if it's still the same nutritional content of the brussel sprouts,"
10:00;10:02;"the kid doesn't want to eat the brussel sprouts."
10:02;10:05;"You would make them taste like Butterfingers so the kid ate them."
10:05;10:07;"So then it was just pure discipline."
10:07;10:09;"If you want to discipline your kid, you drop the brussel sprouts."
10:09;10:12;"Well, you just want to make sure that they never eat a Butterfinger."
10:12;10:15;"Right, but he wouldn't have to eat the Butterfinger"
10:15;10:18;"because he could just make the broccoli taste like Butterfinger."
10:18;10:19;"Theoretically."
10:19;10:21;"This is just like Black Mirror Writer's Room."
10:21;10:24;"[laughter]"
10:24;10:26;"Gotta break that story."
10:26;10:29;"That'd be hilarious, just like walk into a Black Mirror Writer's Room"
10:29;10:31;"and just listen to them."
10:31;10:32;"A bunch of English people would be like,"
10:32;10:37;"""Why would the Butterfinger have to taste like the brussel sprouts?"""
10:37;10:39;"I just love that type of marketing."
10:39;10:41;"I'm sure we've talked about this on the show before, but that type of--"
10:41;10:44;"I mean, it's classic, like, there's the infomercial version,"
10:44;10:47;"which is like, ""Are you tired of your hose being all--"
10:47;10:48;"getting knots in your hose?"""
10:48;10:52;"And then it would show some dude in some improbably insane situation"
10:52;10:55;"where he's like--a hose is wrapped around him like a boa constrictor,"
10:55;10:57;"and he's like, ""What the [bleep]?"""
10:57;11:00;"And it's like making something seem like a bigger problem than it is."
11:00;11:01;"Right, right."
11:01;11:03;"But then there was a similar version of that type of marketing,"
11:03;11:06;"which is to kids, and also I feel like Nathan Freese"
11:06;11:08;"has done some interesting stuff with kids"
11:08;11:11;"where he was telling a group of four-year-olds in a kind of focus group,"
11:11;11:13;"""Do you guys like this toy?"""
11:13;11:14;"And they're like, ""Not really."""
11:14;11:17;"And he said, ""Well, the president just said that if you don't have this toy,"
11:17;11:18;"then you're a baby."""
11:18;11:21;"And the kids--these four-year-olds just kind of start to get confused,"
11:21;11:24;"and he's like, ""Which is fine. So you don't want the toy, right?"""
11:24;11:25;"And the kid's like, ""Um..."""
11:25;11:27;"And he's like, ""No, that's fine. You're a baby."""
11:27;11:28;"And the kid's like, ""I want it."""
11:28;11:29;"So whatever."
11:29;11:31;"Just appealing to the lowest sense of just like--"
11:31;11:34;"I could actually imagine a successful marketing campaign that's--"
11:34;11:37;"because people like that kind of faux wit,"
11:37;11:39;"or that kind of fake breakthrough,"
11:39;11:41;"where it's kind of like, ""Hey, are you eating right now?"""
11:41;11:43;"Somebody's like driving, ""No, I'm not eating."""
11:43;11:45;"""Oh, yeah? You got nothing in your mouth?"""
11:45;11:46;"""No, not really."""
11:46;11:47;"""What about saliva?"""
11:47;11:49;"""Okay, now you have my attention."""
11:49;11:50;"""I'm listening."""
11:50;11:53;"""You're sucking on flavorless, thick water,"
11:53;11:56;"slightly viscous water all day?"""
11:56;11:57;"""Ew."""
11:57;12:00;"""I guess that's what gum is. Gum is flavor-loaded saliva."""
12:00;12:01;"""Yeah, you're right."""
12:01;12:03;"""'Cause gum is not a food. Actually, I was--"""
12:03;12:05;"""It's a sensory experience, but yeah, you're right."""
12:05;12:08;"""As I said recently, because we've been doing Seinfeld Sundays,"
12:08;12:10;"I've been watching Seinfeld all the time."
12:10;12:14;"There's an episode in season 7 that opens with Jerry doing stand-up."
12:14;12:16;"He goes, ""What's the deal with gum?"
12:16;12:18;"It's not liquid, it's not solid. What is it?"""
12:18;12:21;"And I was like, ""What do you mean, it's not liquid, it's not solid?"""
12:21;12:24;"And then I thought about it, and I was like, ""Okay, actually, I see his point."""
12:24;12:26;"I was like, ""Of course, gum is a solid, right?"
12:26;12:29;"But it's a solid that you chew on to extract liquid from, right?"

40:21;40:23;"That was a huge part of your life."
40:23;40:25;"You identified that way."
40:25;40:27;"You wore a dead shirt every day."

40:29;40:35;"I don't think it would be so crazy that they would paint a steely on the coffin."

41:05;41:07;"I like that."
41:07;41:09;"I like the quote on the tombstone."
41:09;41:11;"Something about the logos just starts to get weird."
41:11;41:17;"If the steely logo was engraved into the tombstone, that would be, to me, bizarre."
41:17;41:19;"Well, how far off are we from tattoos then?"
41:19;41:21;"What's that?"
41:21;41:23;"I feel like this is just like getting a tattoo."
41:23;41:27;"I mean, I wouldn't get a tattoo of a brand or a band either."
41:27;41:29;"You wouldn't get a dead tattoo?"
41:29;41:31;"Hell no."
41:31;41:33;"You wouldn't get a GBV tattoo?"

41:37;41:39;"Would you rather be in a GBV coffin or have a tattoo?"
41:39;41:43;"Oh, if I had to choose, I got it by voice, is coffin or tattoo, I'd choose tattoo."
41:43;41:45;"Coming across the gravestone."
41:45;41:47;"Although maybe I should do coffin because I'll be dead."
41:47;41:49;"You don't seem the coffin."
41:49;41:51;"You know what? I'm doing coffin."
41:51;41:53;"I don't want a GBV. I love that band."
41:53;41:55;"I'm not doing a GBV tattoo."

42:03;42:05;"He's gone."
42:05;42:07;"I'm on a message board here."
42:07;42:09;"Nothing's going to bring him back."
42:09;42:13;"This guy, his daughter had passed away and he's soliciting a home."
42:13;42:15;"She was a deadhead."
42:15;42:21;"And he's asking for a custom headstone featuring Grateful Dead bears on it."
42:21;42:23;"And he's kind of reaching out to the public to see if he can do this."
42:23;42:25;"That's beautiful."
42:25;42:27;"They did it tastefully."
42:27;42:29;"I can totally imagine that too."
42:29;42:31;"See, that's another thing."
42:31;42:33;"You can totally imagine in a situation where somebody died young, their parents, their friends."
42:33;42:41;"It's not like this person was 95 and had a lot of time to think about, you know, by the way, when I'm buried, they probably don't have a will or anything like that."
42:41;42:47;"So if a young person died, it's not that crazy that their family or their friends would be like, we don't know what they would have wanted."
42:47;42:49;"We know that when they went out, they were obsessed with this one thing."
42:49;42:51;"And that is something I get about that."
42:51;42:53;"Choosing that for somebody else."
42:53;42:55;"For sure."
42:55;42:57;"What a cool girl, honestly."
42:57;42:59;"Yeah."
42:59;43:05;"And I really think too, not to be corny, but on a very basic level, if you look at the ethos of the dead, which is like this inclusive fun thing."
43:05;43:11;"Say you're walking through a gravestone, you're seeing all sorts of religious stuff and intense things."
43:11;43:17;"And then you came to one and you saw whatever the person's name, 1980 to '97 or something."
43:17;43:19;"You're like, oh, damn, a young person died."
43:19;43:21;"And then you see a dead quote in the bears."
43:21;43:25;"That would bring a smile to a lot of people's face and be like, man, but you know what?"
43:25;43:27;"Like, sounds like that person had some good times when they were alive."
43:27;43:31;"Like on a very basic level, it would bring a little bit of like."
43:31;43:33;"Levity."
43:33;43:34;"Yeah."
43:34;43:35;"I know. I agree."
43:35;43:37;"Levity is more appropriate."
43:37;43:39;"I'm getting the Seinfeld logo."
43:39;43:41;"On your tombstone."
43:41;43:42;"It won't even say my name."
43:42;43:43;"Seinfeld 2000."
43:43;43:44;"That's it."
43:44;43:47;"Well, we were talking high school senior quotes."
43:47;43:48;"Oh, right."
43:48;43:49;"Yeah, that's right."
43:49;43:51;"Start thinking about your gravestone quote, dude."
43:51;43:54;"Mine would probably be like, I'm sorry I was here."
43:54;43:55;"Oh."
43:55;43:56;"Bummer."
43:56;43:57;"That's a bummer."
43:57;44:00;"I took up space for a little and I'm sorry."
44:00;44:02;"Mine would be, I threw gum out the window."
44:02;44:04;"Wait, Jake, are you calling he's gone?"
44:04;44:07;"I might be calling it."
44:07;44:09;"What if we were buried next to each other?"
44:09;44:11;"Jake Longstreet, he's gone."
44:11;44:14;"Ezra Kane, he's gone."
44:14;44:15;"No, I'm he's gone."
44:15;44:19;"And then yours is nothing's going to bring him back."
44:19;44:22;"In this scenario, are you both deceased at the same time?"
44:22;44:23;"Or is one an open plot?"
44:23;44:25;"We died to a big time crisis."
44:25;44:29;"No, I died like a solid 17 years before Ezra did."

50:39;50:42;"and then put a realistic tiger on it somehow?"
50:42;50:43;"I love it."
50:43;50:44;"Anyway--"
50:44;50:45;"We're just going off."
50:45;50:46;"No, but I feel like--I wonder if this has happened yet"
50:46;50:48;"or if this will happen or if there's some reason why"
50:48;50:50;"none of this would ever happen, but yeah, I could imagine."
50:50;50:53;"Two kids, maybe mom or dad, burned through their money."
50:53;50:55;"They had a gambling problem."
50:55;50:56;"So the money's gone."
50:56;50:58;"I thought that dad had millions."
50:58;50:59;"Nope."
50:59;51:01;"He played the ponies and he lost."
51:01;51:03;"So what assets does dad still have?"
51:03;51:04;"Well, the house is in foreclosure."
51:04;51:05;"Okay, so what's left?"
51:05;51:08;"He did have 89 million Instagram followers."
51:08;51:10;"Okay, now that I can work with."
51:10;51:13;"Well, you know, I think as siblings we should share it."
51:13;51:15;"Well..."
51:15;51:17;"This [bleep] could happen, right?"
51:17;51:19;"No one wants the job, though."
51:19;51:20;"It's too much pressure."
51:20;51:22;"They'd be fighting over the opposite."
51:22;51:25;"It turns out that actually your father--"
51:25;51:26;"He left it in the will."
51:26;51:29;"He left it in the will to Amnesty International."
51:29;51:32;"You've got to be [bleep] kidding me."
51:32;51:35;"An intern from Amnesty International just takes over."
51:35;51:39;"And they're selling Fit Tea that then goes to Amnesty International?"
51:39;51:41;"It's so, like, oblique."
51:41;51:44;"The Fit Tea post after they die is so sad."
51:44;51:45;"Could that--"
51:45;51:47;"It's like without them, it's literally just the tea."
51:47;51:48;"Well, also, hold on."
51:48;51:52;"We haven't even mentioned this, that the rights to somebody's image"
51:52;51:53;"are incredibly valuable."
51:53;51:56;"So I don't know if you guys have noticed over the past four or five years,"
51:56;52:00;"I've started to notice a lot more Bob Marley-branded beverages."
52:00;52:01;"Have you seen this?"
52:01;52:02;"You heard about this?"
52:02;52:03;"You drank this?"
52:03;52:05;"I feel like we've discussed it on the show."
52:05;52:06;"I haven't tasted it."
52:06;52:07;"Is it iced tea?"
52:07;52:09;"I think they have iced tea, coffee."
52:09;52:10;"Simon, let me get a number crunch on."
52:10;52:13;"What are the Bob Marley-branded beverages?"
52:13;52:14;"Never seen this."
52:14;52:16;"You never heard about Bob Marley beverages?"
52:16;52:19;"Would Bob Marley-- Would he have wanted this?"
52:19;52:20;"Bob Marley was--"
52:20;52:21;"How is this allowed?"
52:21;52:22;"I don't understand that."
52:22;52:24;"There's a Bob Marley cold brew."
52:24;52:26;"What if he hated coffee?"
52:26;52:29;"Mellow mood, you got yerba mate, you got cold brew."
52:29;52:30;"And this is all from the Marley--"
52:30;52:31;"Yerba mate."
52:31;52:32;"There's the Marley Beverage Co."
52:32;52:33;"Yerba mate."
52:33;52:36;"Marley Beverage Co. in partnership with Bob Marley's family"
52:36;52:41;"is committed to creating mate, tea, and coffee drinks"
52:41;52:43;"that are faithful to his legacy."
52:43;52:44;"Oh, okay."
52:44;52:45;"That's sweet."
52:45;52:47;"They have a coffee drink called One Drop."
52:47;52:48;"One Drop."
52:48;52:49;"Oh, my God."
52:49;52:50;"Listen to this quote."
52:50;52:51;"This is so time crisis."
52:51;52:52;"Holy [bleep]"
52:52;52:54;"First of all, this is on a website called BevNet."
52:54;52:58;"I guess this is the pitchfork of beverages."
52:58;53:00;"New Age Beverages Corporation,"
53:00;53:02;"the Colorado-based organic and natural beverage company"
53:02;53:05;"intending to become the world's leading healthy beverage company,"
53:05;53:08;"today announced the rollout of its Marley cold brew coffee."
53:08;53:09;"You also got to think, like--"
53:09;53:10;"That is deep."
53:10;53:12;"When a family sells the rights to somebody,"
53:12;53:15;"it's not quite as crass as somebody being like,"
53:15;53:17;"""Well, Grandpa's dead."
53:17;53:18;"I want to start a beverage business."""
53:18;53:20;"It might be as simple as somebody coming to them"
53:20;53:25;"and being like, ""Hey, there's an organic beverage company in Colorado"
53:25;53:28;"that wants to give you guys $5 million to license Grandpa."
53:28;53:29;"Here's the deal."""
53:29;53:31;"And they look around, and they're like, ""Well, whatever."
53:31;53:33;"She needs a hip replacement."
53:33;53:34;"It's been a tough year."""
53:34;53:38;"It's not quite as disgusting as a family just dancing on somebody's grave."
53:38;53:39;"So I want to be--"
53:39;53:41;"I don't know the details of the Marley family,"
53:41;53:43;"but here's a quote."
53:43;53:46;"""The rollout of Marley cold brew is a huge benchmark"
53:46;53:49;"in what has become a complete transformation of the Marley brand"
53:49;53:52;"since its acquisition last year,"" said Jay Barrow,"
53:52;53:54;"chief brand officer at New Age."
53:54;53:57;"""The brand is now completely rebuilt with an identity and iconography"
53:57;54:02;"that resonates with the more than 70 million loyal Marley Facebook followers."
54:02;54:05;"The talent and capabilities behind the Marley brand are extensive,"
54:05;54:07;"and this is only the beginning of what will become"
54:07;54:10;"a very impactful brand-building campaign."""
54:10;54:15;"So that guy's specifically referencing how many Facebook followers Bob Marley has."
54:15;54:18;"So that's a huge part of why there's value in this."
54:18;54:21;"So yeah, those social media followers, it's the same way."
54:21;54:23;"There's always some article that's kind of like,"
54:23;54:27;"""You know that this year Marilyn Monroe made more money than she made in her lifetime"
54:27;54:29;"just from licensing."""
54:29;54:32;"All these things are going to be very important in the future."
55:45;55:50;"I want more rock star and musician beverages."
55:50;55:53;"Like why doesn't Jim Morrison have like a brand of whiskey or something?"
55:53;55:54;"Because the doors are played out."
55:54;55:58;"Not true, man. That is a deeply iconic, timeless brand."
55:58;56:01;"Dude, it's like a college dorm when you got Marley and you got Morrison."
56:01;56:03;"No, they don't have-- it's not Morrison anymore."
56:03;56:04;"Really?"
56:04;56:05;"I'm not even trying to be a d*** here."
56:05;56:06;"Cobain?"
56:06;56:07;"I like the doors."
56:07;56:11;"I think Cobain and Morrison are similar enough that Cobain fully took over."
56:11;56:15;"There's rock star energy drink, though, that really encompasses all of the stars."
56:15;56:18;"I feel like they probably each get like a small cut."
56:18;56:19;"Yeah, you're right about that."
56:19;56:20;"I don't think Cobain would want a drink."
56:20;56:21;"Yeah, because he was like a punk."
56:21;56:23;"I mean, I don't know much about Marley's world."
56:23;56:25;"Marley is super cool."
56:25;56:28;"Bob Marley might be one of the wokest pop stars of all time."
56:28;56:29;"I get that, but--"
56:29;56:32;"Have you ever talked about on this show, like my favorite interview with Bob Marley,"
56:32;56:34;"where it's like this English guy?"
56:34;56:36;"He's like an English journalist who's trying to make him seem like a hypocrite."
56:36;56:39;"The English guy basically says something along the lines of like,"
56:39;56:41;"""Are you a very wealthy man now?"""
56:41;56:45;"And, you know, trying to be like, ""Oh, you're supposed to be like this third world woke dude."""
56:45;56:46;"""Oh, but you're rich now, huh?"""
56:46;56:49;"Like, you know, classic kind of gotcha questioning system."
56:49;56:51;"They're like, ""What do you mean wealthy?"""
56:51;56:54;"And the guy's like, ""Are you rich? Do you have a lot of money?"""
56:54;56:56;"Bob Marley goes, ""Money make you rich?"""
56:56;56:59;"And then he says something about like, ""My riches are not on this earth."""
56:59;57:01;"Just like some super like--"
57:01;57:02;"Wow."
57:02;57:03;"Actually, I want to play that."
57:03;57:04;"Yeah, that sounds awesome."
57:06;57:08;"Money."
57:08;57:11;"I mean, how much is a lot of money to you?"
57:11;57:13;"Yeah, that's a good question."
57:13;57:16;"Have you made, say, millions of dollars?"
57:16;57:17;"No."
57:17;57:19;"Are you a rich man?"
57:19;57:21;"What do you mean rich? What do you mean?"
57:21;57:23;"Do you have a lot of possessions?"
57:23;57:24;"A lot of money in the bank?"
57:24;57:26;"Possession make you rich?"
57:26;57:28;"I don't have that type of richness."
57:28;57:29;"My richness is life."
57:29;57:30;"Oh, I got it wrong."
57:30;57:32;"Okay, do you have a lot of possessions?"
57:32;57:33;"Possession make you rich?"
57:33;57:34;"Right."
57:34;57:35;"My richness is life."
57:35;57:37;"Do you have any beverages?"
57:37;57:38;"Any branded beverages?"
57:38;57:40;"Beverage make you rich?"
57:40;57:43;"Beverage make you rich."
57:43;57:47;"Anyway, this is all to say that Bob Marley like truly is in a league of his own."
57:47;57:51;"He's just being like this cool disconnected dude who practiced what he preached."
57:51;57:52;"That was amazing."
57:52;57:54;"I'm shook."
57:54;57:55;"Really?"
57:55;57:57;"I felt like when I first saw that it kind of like gave me chills."
57:57;58:02;"I was just like, especially when you look around today, there's just like kind of no equivalent."
58:02;58:03;"And understandably, I'm not calling it-"
58:03;58:05;"I wonder if Dylan stole that from Marley."
58:05;58:08;"You mean my treasure on the earth?"
58:08;58:10;"It's also funny too because it's like-"
58:10;58:11;"Bob saw that and he's like, ""Oh, that's a good line."""
58:11;58:15;"If you kind of use like religious philosophical language, on the one hand, you can be above it all,"
58:15;58:18;"but you can also get into some weird nihilistic where somebody like, ""Are you rich?"""
58:18;58:21;"You're like, ""What do you mean rich? Got millions?"""
58:21;58:25;"""Oh yeah, I'm loaded, but that's merely my treasure on the earth. My kingdom lies in heaven."""
58:25;58:28;"It's like, that's almost like some like shady preacher."
58:28;58:31;"Did you know that Bob Dylan launched a brand of whiskey this year?"
58:31;58:32;"Oh, that sounds familiar."
58:32;58:33;"No."
58:33;58:35;"You knew that, Kazzy?"
58:35;58:36;"I did know that."
58:36;58:37;"That's tight."
58:37;58:38;"You're a big Dylan fan?"
58:38;58:39;"Yeah."
58:39;58:40;"Are you a Dylan fan?"
58:40;58:41;"As much as everyone."
58:41;58:43;"Actually, by the way, I know we're all over the place today."
58:43;58:45;"Just one of those days."
58:45;58:46;"But I was curious about this."
58:46;58:48;"Do you listen to Bob Marley?"
58:48;58:49;"I do not."
58:49;58:50;"But you know who he is?"
58:50;58:51;"Yes."
58:51;58:52;"You're familiar?"
58:52;58:54;"Do you listen to Nirvana or Kurt Cobain?"
58:54;58:55;"Mm-hmm."
58:55;58:56;"Now, what about The Doors?"
58:56;58:58;"Jim Morrison and The Doors."
58:58;59:02;"Are they remotely at the same level as those other iconic musical figures?"
59:02;59:03;"How familiar are you with them?"
59:03;59:04;"How much do you care about them?"
59:04;59:06;"I'm not very familiar with them, no."
59:06;59:09;"But I think if you played their music, I would definitely know it."
59:09;59:11;"They're on Peace Frog."
59:11;59:13;"Peace Frog is kind of a deep cut."
59:13;59:14;"It's a great song, though."
59:14;59:15;"No, no."
59:15;59:16;"I like The Doors."
59:16;59:19;"My point is just that in the '90s, there was kind of Doors mania,"
59:19;59:22;"whereas now The Doors is not really popular."
59:22;59:27;"I just feel like that image, the Jim Morrison image, still thrives."
59:27;59:28;"But maybe I'm way off."
59:28;59:29;"Not the music."
59:29;59:30;"I agree."
59:30;59:34;"I mean, in terms of the classic rock bands, The Doors are pretty far down the totem pole."
59:34;59:35;"You went to college, right?"
59:35;59:37;"Did people have Bob Marley posters in dorms?"
59:37;59:38;"Is that still a thing?"
59:38;59:39;"Yeah, I think so."
59:39;59:42;"How often did you see a Jim Morrison poster?"
59:42;59:44;"I'm not a very observant person."
59:44;59:46;"Super absent-minded."
59:46;59:48;"What about Dave Matthews Band?"
59:48;59:50;"That feels like a big college poster."
59:50;59:51;"That's pretty alt."
59:51;59:53;"Oh, hell yeah."
59:53;59:56;"Jake."
59:56;01:00:03;"This be a good vampire cover?"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"This would be sick, dude."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Bucket hat?"
01:00:06;01:00:07;"Bucket hat on the kid."

01:02:49;01:02:52;"I'd be remiss not to mention this."

01:02:55;01:02:57;"The other day, I listened to a 12-minute"

01:02:59;01:03:00;"Have you ever listened to that?"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Oh, I never heard that."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"It's like super noodley."

01:03:09;01:03:12;"'cause he does Sitting in Limbo, Heart of They Come."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"We did Heart of They Come, our last show."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Oh really?"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"At the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Oh sick."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Are you in a band?"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"Yeah, I'm in a Grateful Dead cover band."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"They're major, you gotta check 'em out."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"For real?"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Yeah, yeah."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Oh, Richard's Pictures."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"We played the Old Town Pub in Pasadena last week."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"I gotta come."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"We'll let you know."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"Okay, great."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"The thing I was gonna say is that,"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"so obviously the Dead loved reggae,"
01:03:33;01:03:36;"and Jerry in particular, clearly covered Bob Marley."
01:03:36;01:03:39;"The day after Bob Marley died, in the early '80s,"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"the Dead played He's Gone in his honor."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"I don't know if they said something,"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"it was perceived to be in his honor."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"This is for Bob."
01:03:45;01:03:48;"It was like an emotional he's gone when Bob Marley died."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Come in full circle."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"That's a great song for that occasion."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"It's like a classic re-appropriation,"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"'cause the song itself is kind of like"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"about a bad man being gone."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Right."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"But whatever, at the end of the day,"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"he's gone."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"Did Bob Marley ever listen to the Dead?"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Who knows?"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"Probably not."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"No reason to think he did."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Anyway, it's time for the Top 5."
01:04:09;01:04:15;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"So this week on the Top 5,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"we're doing something kind of crazy."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"This is the Songs of the Summer edition."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"Okay."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"So we're gonna look at the top five songs"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"of this summer according to Billboard,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"and we're gonna compare it not to one year,"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"but various decades of songs."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"So we're gonna compare the number five Billboard song"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"to the song of the summer '68."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Then we're gonna compare the number four song"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"to the song of the summer '78."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"Oh, okay."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"We're sticking with the eights."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"We're going back 50 years."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"We're doing crazy eights."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Okay."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"This is a crazy eights summer edition,"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"just to kind of get a broader spectrum of summer songs."
01:04:49;01:04:53;"So we're gonna start by taking it all the way back to 1968."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"The number one song of the summer of '68,"
01:04:56;01:04:57;"which was--"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"♪ Hot town, summer in the city ♪"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"50 years ago."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Yeah."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"You know what else I've been thinking about recently?"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"How many people there are on the planet at any given moment."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"And I was like, I wonder how long ago"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"were there half as many people on the planet?"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"And you go back and you're like,"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"it was like the late '60s, early '70s."
01:05:12;01:05:16;"So you're like, when the doors dropped Peace Frog,"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"there were literally half as many people"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"on the planet as today."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I don't know what to do with that information,"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"but there's something about it that's eerie."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"All these major cultural milestones"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"that we think about in the past,"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"there were just so many less people around."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Yeah, that's wild."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Do you think there were less idiots?"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"No."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"Same percentage."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"Same percentage of idiots."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Okay, but you're right."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"That's a baseline."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"'Cause most people are idiots, I'm sad to say,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"myself included, but you're right."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"There would have been less idiots on the planet."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Oh, and some."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"'Cause yeah, you're like, less people, less idiots."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Technically."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Also, when people talk about all the ways"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"in which the internet means that there's more out there"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"and stuff, there's just so many more people."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"That's another thing that I think we don't talk about enough"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"is people are like, humanity's never dealt with the internet"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"and all these opinions and stuff."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Humanity's also never dealt with this many people."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"Your grandma was born."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"There might have been a third as many people on the planet."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Just a lot, a lot of people."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"Anyway, the song of the summer in '68"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"was Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"This Guy's In Love With You."
01:06:15;01:06:18;"Great song."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"Written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David."

01:10:01;01:10:03;"But also remember, Post has a rock background,"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"so it wouldn't surprise me if eventually"

01:10:06;01:10:08;"He'll go country in like 10 years."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"I bet he could do it well."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"He could lean more into that."

01:10:16;01:10:17;"If he plays his cards right,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"he could be this generation's Eminem."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"No, that's a huge stretch."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"In terms of like taking over the culture."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"There could never be another Eminem."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"He doesn't have as forceful a personality"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"or point of view as Eminem did."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"That strident Eminem personality"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"is what you needed to break through back then."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"Today, different mood."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"You just need that tasteful new age palate."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"You just need tasteful palate."

01:13:47;01:13:48;"- Yeah, it's been downhill from there."
01:13:48;01:13:50;"- That was a classic. - That was something."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"The song of the summer in '88."

01:14:39;01:14:50;"- Is this a cover though of like a song from the '60s?"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"I think so, right?"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"- The writers are credited as Steve Winwood, Will Jennings,"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"and then Holland Dozier Holland, who were major songwriters."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Maybe he got sued or something."

01:15:07;01:15:08;"of the cover of the cover."
01:15:08;01:15:11;"- You mean where you can do a direct chain?"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"- Yeah."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Like someone covered."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- People talk about that sometimes"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"with Leonard Cohen ""Hallelujah,"""
01:15:17;01:15:19;"because the original Leonard Cohen version"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"is kind of like vibey and weird and like synthy."
01:15:24;01:15:27;"And then on a Leonard Cohen tribute album in the early '90s,"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"John Cale from the Velvet Underground did a cover,"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"which is kind of what Jeff Buckley was covering."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"- Right, and that became the sort of version"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"to cover after that."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"- Yeah, so in that way you can see a chain"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"where it's like the 99% of people"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"who are like singing ""Hallelujah"" wherever on the boards."

01:15:55;01:15:57;"But hold on a second."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"So Steve Winwood wrote this song, but you're right."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"He was told that his song sounded a little too much"
01:16:02;01:16:06;"like an old Motown song, Junior Walker ""I'm a Roadrunner."""

01:17:47;01:17:48;"- He's a nice guy."

01:17:55;01:17:57;"but you're up front with that,"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"is that being an (beep) boy?"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"- Maybe in some circumstances."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Sure."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"- But if you're constantly telling everyone,"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"like I love women,"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"like I respect women,"
01:18:06;01:18:07;"I'm a great guy."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"- Like Trump?"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"Oh, Trump's totally an (beep) boy, isn't he?"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"- He's a Trump boy."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"- 70 year old."
01:18:12;01:18:14;"- That's like too nice even for him."
01:18:14;01:18:15;"- Well, you know what it is?"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"I also think it's a little like,"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"remember we talked about like there's that classic"
01:18:18;01:18:19;"kind of like,"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"it's like an Eagle song or something"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"that like song about rock excess."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"That's just like,"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"man, this world's crazy."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"Is it all meaningless?"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"You know, and I can relate to that too."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"- Yeah."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"- But you're, you know, you're still doing it."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"You're still writing a song about it."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"So it's also kind of like,"
01:18:34;01:18:38;"if maybe the first 50 Drake songs were about kind of like,"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"yo, I love women,"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"but also I don't know how to be in a relationship"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"and I want to treat them right,"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"but I've left good girls behind"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"and blah, blah, blah."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"And it's weird."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"You know, at first you,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"you recognize an issue."
01:18:51;01:18:52;"I guess it's like with anything,"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"you could recognize an issue."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"He recognized in himself."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- It's weird."
01:18:55;01:18:58;"- How weird it is that you could love different women"
01:18:58;01:19:01;"and also have to leave them."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"And did you make mistakes?"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"You know, whatever you recognize that"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"you're examining yourself."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"- Sure, that's a normal."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"- Do you then create a new course of action,"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"which is like, okay, you know,"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"I've been thinking about it."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"I made a hundred songs about how I can't trust anybody"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"and how I've left so many good girls behind."
01:19:16;01:19:17;"The next phase of my life,"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"I'm going to really clean house,"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"stop worrying so much about my career,"
01:19:21;01:19:24;"settle down with a good girl and some good friends."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"And you probably won't hear from me for a while,"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"but of course not."
01:19:27;01:19:29;"It's like, you got, it never ends."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"- Yeah, but couldn't you keep the career popping"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"and just start writing different types of songs?"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"- It could also be a little bit like"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"on some like Ozzy Osbourne,"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"where it's like,"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"he wasn't biting the heads off bats in the nineties."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"You know, we saw it on the TV show."
01:19:44;01:19:47;"He's a dad living in a big house on the West side of LA,"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"just hanging out with his kids,"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"dealing with all sorts of goofy stuff,"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"but he would still, you know,"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"put on some makeup and go on stage and sing about Satan."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"'Cause that's what you do."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"Alice Cooper or something like that."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"So maybe--"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"- That's the brand."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"- It could be, you know, when Drake in like 10 years,"
01:20:01;01:20:04;"Drake is married, couple kids,"
01:20:04;01:20:07;"living in Calabasas."
01:20:07;01:20:08;"And he keeps that really quiet."
01:20:08;01:20:11;"And then he drops an album that's just like about,"
01:20:11;01:20:15;"oh, Teresa and Boise, we were texting."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Oh my God."
01:20:17;01:20:20;"Like, 'cause that's what people want from Drake."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Also imagine if Drake--"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"- But then he could really grow as an artist"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"to write the album about, you know,"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"living in Calabasas."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"- He'll be at a crossroads."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Or imagine that Drake finally cleaned house"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"and he's like, you know what?"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"I can finally trust everybody."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"- Yeah."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"- These are great."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"- I can finally trust everybody."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"You know what?"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Time and time again,"
01:20:39;01:20:43;"I was looking for trust with people who obviously"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"weren't gonna give me what I wanted."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"I should clean house and I should really just,"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"hang out with my family and you know,"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"three to four close friends."
01:20:50;01:20:52;"My entourage is way too big."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"I was asking for trouble."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"Even if he does that, for all we know,"
01:20:56;01:21:00;"Drake, well, he kept his baby quiet."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Maybe he is married."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"He's got kids and he's only hangs out with people"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"he can trust and they do right by him."
01:21:07;01:21:09;"- It's a Black Mirror episode."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"- Yeah, start writing about the sound of the wind"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"rustling through the eucalyptus leaves."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"- Just start--"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"- Glinting off the pool in the morning."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"- Drake just starts dropping haikus."
01:21:19;01:21:19;"- Yeah, man."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"- The eucalyptus leaves rustle."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"I can trust everybody in my circle."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"- Could be a banger."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"- I am content."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- The word eucalyptus."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"- Eucalyptus."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"- You can still rap about Instagram."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"- Eucalyptus does sound like a Drake song."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"- That would be a tight album title."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Drake, eucalyptus."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"- That is so realistic."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"- That's cool because actually this album"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"was called Scorpion."
01:21:40;01:21:41;"- Okay."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"- Scorpion is a animal that we associate"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"with stinging and poison."
01:21:46;01:21:46;"- Right."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"- Eucalyptus soothes."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"I gave you scorpion."
01:21:49;01:21:51;"That was the end of the conflicted Drake."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"- But the eucalyptus is also a non-native species."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"It's a transplant."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"- And Drake's Canadian."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"- And everyone comes to Southern California"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"with the dream, they transplant to Southern California"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"with the dream of making it big."
01:22:04;01:22:05;"- Right."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"I love it."
01:22:06;01:22:11;"- Drake, eucalyptus coming later in 2018."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Coming December 2018."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"- No, it's like in two months."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"- Yeah, coming October 2018."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"Drake, eucalyptus."
01:22:17;01:22:20;"Anyway, the number one song of the summer, 98."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"And you know what's interesting, 98,"
01:22:22;01:22:23;"that's when I was 14."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"- Oh, nice."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"- And so this song does loom large for me."
01:22:26;01:22:29;"Brandy and Monica, The Boy Is Mine."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Do you know this song, Jake?"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"- I bet I will."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"- Do you know this song, Kazzy?"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"- No."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"- Do you know The Boy Is Mine by Brandy and Monica?"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"- Not yet."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"- What?"
01:22:38;01:22:38;"- Wow."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Now for people like me and Seinfeld,"
01:22:39;01:22:42;"Silverback Millennials, this is like a..."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"- Is that a common term, Silverback Millennial?"
01:22:44;01:22:47;"- No, I created it about a year ago."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"It never caught on."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- It's great."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- It never caught on, not even remotely,"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"but I'm bringing it back one last time."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"This song was so massive and the video was topping TRL"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"all summer long."
01:22:57;01:23:00;"- 98, I was still big into terrestrial radio."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"- What is terrestrial radio?"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"- What was that intro?"
01:23:03;01:23:03;"- Radio."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"- I've never heard that intro to your car."
01:23:04;01:23:05;"- Have you ever heard that?"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- I've never heard that either."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"- Like when you randomly encounter music."
01:23:08;01:23:13;"- Okay, I love that beautiful, like, what is it?"
01:23:13;01:23:13;"- It's a chime?"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"- It's like some spa music."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"It's like a weird harp sound almost."
01:23:17;01:23:21;"Welcome to the spa."
01:23:21;01:23:24;"- This is Rodney Jerkins, right?"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"- Yeah, it's actually a nice..."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"- It's beautiful."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"- Through line to Post Malone."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"- I bet Post could murder this."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"- Do you know somebody named?"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"- You know his name?"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"- Oh yeah, definitely, I know his name."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"I just want to let you know that he's mine."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"- No, no, he's mine."
01:23:41;01:23:54;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"- Oh, they're fighting over the same dude?"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"- Of course, this song."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"- So you do know it?"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"♪ The boy is mine ♪"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"- This song does not pass the,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"what's it called, the Bechdel test?"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- This song doesn't pass the Bechdel test?"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- No, right?"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- What is that test again?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"- I think it's when two women are in a scene"
01:24:13;01:24:16;"and they're not talking about anything other than a man."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"- I think it's about how often women talk to each other"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"in a movie because there's a lot of movies"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"that might have female characters,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"but if the female characters are always talking to men,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"it's still male-centric."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"And then if the women are talking to each other,"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"but they're talking about a man, it's still male-centric."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"So I think those are the two,"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"in broad strokes, those are the major roles."
01:24:36;01:24:40;"So in this song, it is two women talking to each other."
01:24:40;01:24:41;"So you're saying just about everything"
01:24:41;01:24:42;"they're saying is about the boy."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- I think this fails."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"- The name must fail."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- I would say most music would fail."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"And movies and everything."

01:29:09;01:29:10;"Wait, we've had this conversation."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"- I hate challenges."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"Like, they give me anxiety."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"- Just generally in life?"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"- Yeah, I just hate them."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"There's so much participation."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"- Have you ever done a challenge?"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"- No, I'll never do a challenge."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"- You didn't do the ice bucket challenge?"

01:29:24;01:29:26;"- I feel like the word challenge is not even--"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"- I'll invent a challenge"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"and I'll be the first to do a challenge,"
01:29:28;01:29:31;"but I will not participate in a challenge."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"- That'd be pretty crazy to start a challenge."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"- TC challenge."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"- Has it ever happened, Grace,"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"that we've tried to start challenges before?"
01:29:37;01:29:37;"- I think we did."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"- Oh, we did the goldfish challenge."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"- I mean, that took off."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"- Are you aware--"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"- No."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"- The goldfish challenge is--"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"- I would participate in a goldfish challenge."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"- The goldfish challenge is you throw a party"
01:29:47;01:29:51;"and at the snack table, you put out hummus,"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"but you don't put out any carrots or chips or anything,"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"or any kind of sauce."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"- Just goldfish."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"- You could also put out guacamole sauce or whatever,"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"but the only thing that you could possibly use"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"to scoop it up is goldfish."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"And then you just see how people act."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"- That's so brilliant."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"- To see if anybody asks you,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"hey, you got anything besides goldfish?"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"- Did you tape it?"
01:30:10;01:30:11;"You have to put a camera up there."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"- Well, people have sent us still images."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- This was the Super Bowl goldfish challenge too."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"- That was the Super Bowl goldfish challenge."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"- That's high stakes."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"- Oh my God, that's so funny."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"- You throw a Super Bowl party"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"and you only put out goldfish."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"- Oh, so what is the In My Feelings challenge?"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"- It's a dance, right?"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"- Hard pass."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"- You play a part of the song."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"- Yeah, hard pass, exactly."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"- You get out of your car and someone's filming you"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"and you're dancing while the car is moving."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"- Wait, what?"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"You keep the car in drive and you get out?"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"- It's not even like that thing,"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"what was that called when you would--"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"- Oh, ghost riding the whip?"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"- At least that makes sense."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"- The In My Feelings challenge also is interesting"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"'cause it just started as one guy, I believe it was Shiggy,"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"zeroed in on this particular part of this song"
01:30:50;01:30:53;"and he did a dance that kind of slightly mimics the lyrics"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"'cause it goes, ""Kiki, do you love me?"""
01:30:55;01:30:55;"And he does the heart."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"""Are you riding?"""
01:30:56;01:30:59;"And he does something like he's driving a car."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"So it started out just people doing it"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"and then it kind of suddenly became a thing"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"where you do it outside the door of a moving car."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"- You know, someone can do something interesting"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"and we don't all have to do it, you know?"
01:31:10;01:31:10;"- Fair point."
01:31:10;01:31:13;"- You need everybody to do it for it to be a thing."
01:31:13;01:31:16;"We live in a society, period."
01:31:16;01:31:20;"We live in a society where it's all about the numbers."
01:31:20;01:31:24;"So what's the point of just doing one cool thing?"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"You need numbers."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"You need a lot of people doing it."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"You need to keep it going."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Anyway, Jake, this is how it goes."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"- I still don't understand what it is."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"You're not the driver."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"- No, the driver is filming you."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"- And you just get out of the passenger seat?"

01:32:59;01:33:01;"- That they can do it better."
01:33:01;01:33:02;"- Right on."

01:33:05;01:33:07;"We zero in on a new phenomenon,"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"the In My Feelings Challenge."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Will it go viral?"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"- Do you think you have to have no intention"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"of creating a challenge to create the challenge?"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"- That's a great question."
01:33:17;01:33:18;"- Yeah, it has to be organic, right?"
01:33:18;01:33:21;"- Something that a lot of people who run social media"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"for brands would like to know."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"Seinfeld, cross-reference Wendy's Twitter"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"with the Drake In My Feelings Challenge."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Did that happen?"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"Her probably Moon Pie, those (beep) suck ups."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"- Moon Pie."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"- Moon Pie tweeted at Wendy's,"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"""Wendy's, do you love me?"""
01:33:38;01:33:41;"- I don't think Wendy's jumped on the challenge,"
01:33:41;01:33:44;"but I do see a lot of people tweeting at Wendy's"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"with the In My Feelings Challenge hashtag"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"being like, ""Wendy's, where you at on this?"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"""How come you haven't jumped on it?"""
01:33:49;01:33:52;"- Well, be careful what you wish for, Wendy's."
01:33:52;01:33:56;"All your savage burns and epic clapbacks."
01:33:56;01:33:59;"Now you're so tied to culture, you can't take a day off."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"- Painted yourself into a real corner here, Wendy's."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"- Do you actually work for Wendy's?"
01:34:03;01:34:04;"- No."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"Really wanna put that out there."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"I did not attend Vassar."
01:34:07;01:34:10;"And I have no affiliation with the Wendy's brand."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- It would be so tight if you did."
01:34:12;01:34:13;"- I'm so glad I asked,"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"'cause I was really gonna leave here thinking that."
01:34:15;01:34:16;"- So for weeks and weeks,"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"you would have talked about Wendy's"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"and I'd just be quietly lurking here,"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"sweat drop, smiling."
01:34:22;01:34:26;"- That would be top 10 anime betrayals for ""Sign Crisis."""
01:34:26;01:34:29;"If suddenly it was revealed that Seinfeld"
01:34:29;01:34:33;"was one of the social media managers for Wendy's,"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"that'd be so crazy."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"- I think they retweeted me once."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"- Really?"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"- And it was so early in the savage clapback Twitter era"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"that I was a little stoked on it."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"I think that's the closest I've gotten."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"- Before it became a whole thing?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"You wouldn't be stoked now?"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"- No, now that we've really interrogated it"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"and thought about it and it's like a little played out"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"to like be a clapback brand,"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"no, I wouldn't be stoked anymore."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"- I wonder if ""Time Crisis"" is becoming basic"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"with our takes on Wendy's."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Bear with me, 'cause we all know that"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"as a conversation develops in culture,"
01:35:03;01:35:06;"one point of view is basic and another one is cutting edge."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"And then as time goes on,"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"the cutting edge one becomes basic."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"And the one that used to be basic,"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"you're actually supposed to adopt to be a contrarian"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"and say like, ""All these people saying that whatever,"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"""capitalism is bad."""
01:35:18;01:35:20;"You know, like eventually you have to go full circle."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"So it was basic."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"That's just how, I don't make the rules."
01:35:24;01:35:25;"This is how it works."
01:35:25;01:35:28;"Bran started serving savage clapbacks."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"It was very basic at first."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Like you were even saying Seinfeld,"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"you were kind of stoked on getting"
01:35:32;01:35:33;"a savage Wendy's clapback."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"- It was fresh."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"It was like, you know,"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"these guys have dropped the veneer of the corporate polish"
01:35:38;01:35:39;"and they're just getting in there"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"with the so-called weird Twitter."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"- Right, it's kind of like this,"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"like I hate these faceless brands."
01:35:44;01:35:44;"And then it's kind of like,"
01:35:44;01:35:46;"brands are starting to get real."
01:35:46;01:35:46;"I like that."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"And then it became background to be like,"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"you idiots are getting psyched"
01:35:50;01:35:53;"because Wendy's jumped on a meme."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"That's the most basic ever."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"And so then we, you know, became, it's basic to life."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"And that's kind of the time crisis view."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Because that time crisis,"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"we position ourselves as being a little bit above it all."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Be like, we don't appreciate that."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"But then, as often happens with these things,"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"then you start seeing people saying like,"
01:36:08;01:36:08;"oh, and by the way,"
01:36:08;01:36:11;"all the elitists who are (beep) on brands"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"that are just trying to do social media,"
01:36:12;01:36:16;"keep in mind, you're talking about a poorly paid person"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"who doesn't have power within the organization,"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"who's just trying to make rent for that month."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"And that becomes like the new most extreme viewpoint."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"So then eventually it might be like,"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"you know what, when you really think about it,"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"the people doing Wendy's social media"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"are actually a lot more socialist"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"than the (beep) people on Twitter complaining about it."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"You know what I mean?"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"We've all witnessed conversations that go this way."
01:36:36;01:36:36;"- Yikes."
01:36:36;01:36:39;"- I think the truth is with everything that happens,"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I mean, short of things that are, you know,"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"undeniably like literally hurting people or whatever,"
01:36:44;01:36:45;"with things that are like,"
01:36:45;01:36:46;"kind of you can't quite put your finger on"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"if it's a good or a bad thing,"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"there's always gonna be a little bit of a cycle"
01:36:49;01:36:53;"that liking it is whack and hating it's cool,"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"then hating it's whack and being like,"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"you know what, (beep) you, I actually like it as cool."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I guess the only truly enlightened view"
01:36:59;01:37:00;"is when you're kind of above it all"
01:37:00;01:37:03;"and you're just like, I've lived for many moons."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"I've seen times of war, times of peace,"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"I've seen death, I've seen life."
01:37:06;01:37:11;"Happiness is ephemeral, but sadness is ephemeral too."
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Wendy's clapbacks, I've seen moments"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"when they were considered savage"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"and times when they were considered laughable."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"- Take the Bob Marley approach."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"- Yeah, just chill out."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"Would you raise your fist in anger at the wind?"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"These are the cycles of life."
01:37:24;01:37:27;"- This is track eight on the new Drake record."
01:37:27;01:37:27;"- Yeah."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"(laughing)"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"You can live to this."
01:37:30;01:37:33;"- Drake, you can live, I swear that really sounds real."
01:37:33;01:37:36;"The song of the summer in 2008,"
01:37:36;01:37:39;"that was quite a summer for me in my neighborhood"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"'cause that was the first summer"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"that Vampire Weekend was like out there."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"Our first album came out January 2008"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"and that was the first time"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"we'd be playing festivals and stuff."
01:37:47;01:37:51;"I actually briefly met Katie for the first time in 2008."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"She was a host. - Katie Davidson?"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"- No, I met Katie Davidson before then."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Katie Perry, the two Katie's."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"- Oh, are we listening to Katie Perry right now?"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"(laughing)"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"- You really thought that?"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"- I was like, I don't know what,"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"I have no idea what's coming next."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"- Katie Perry was one of the hosts"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"of a short-lived MTV show."
01:38:08;01:38:11;"I think Pete Wentz was the main host from Fall Out Boy."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- Okay."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"- MTV was trying to kind of bring back videos"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"and they did a show,"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"I literally can't remember what the show was called,"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"and they showed her and Lil Wayne"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"our video for Oxford Comma."
01:38:22;01:38:25;"I know that there's video, apparently,"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"'cause one of the producers told me this,"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"of Lil Wayne sitting in his trailer"
01:38:29;01:38:32;"watching the Oxford Comma video and talking about it."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"I don't know if it's ever been aired."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"I don't even know if I believe this,"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"but they told me that after that,"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"Lil Wayne made a video for his hit song, ""A Milli,"""
01:38:40;01:38:42;"and he made a one-shot video"
01:38:42;01:38:43;"that's like him walking out of his trailer."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"This person swore to me"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"that Lil Wayne watched the Oxford Comma video"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"and was like, oh, that's interesting."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"I'll make a video like that."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"We didn't invent the one-shot video,"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"but I'm, so whatever,"
01:38:54;01:38:55;"it's not like we're super creative or anything."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"- Wow."
01:38:56;01:38:59;"- I just wanna see this video of Lil Wayne in 2008"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"watching the Vampire Weekend."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"MTV, can we hook this up?"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Can somebody inquire?"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"Kazzy, do you know anybody on MTV?"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"- No."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"- Okay, this is more like a Seinfeld thing."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Seinfeld, get on that."
01:39:11;01:39:14;"- The show was called Feedback New MTV."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"FNMTV."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"- Oh, yeah, FNMTV."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"I also remember being backstage"
01:39:19;01:39:23;"and somebody brought Lil Mama in to talk to us."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"Do you guys know who Lil Mama is?"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"- What a night you had."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"- No, I don't."
01:39:26;01:39:28;"That's when I really knew I made it."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"I met Pete Wentz, Lil Mama."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"- It's like squad goals."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"- Kind of."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"I mean, I actually like all these people."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"I always liked Lil Mama."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Also, when I was a teacher in Brooklyn,"
01:39:37;01:39:40;"the first song ever that the kids showed me"
01:39:40;01:39:44;"before it blew up was her hit song, Lip Gloss."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"My lip gloss is cool."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"Do you know this one?"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"My lip gloss is cool."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"My lip gloss is poppin'."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"So I remember the kids would be talking about that song."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"But what is that?"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"It hadn't blown up yet."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"And I was like, all right."
01:39:55;01:39:56;"Your old teacher learning something."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"- How old were the kids that you taught?"
01:39:58;01:40:01;"- Like 14, average age."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"- Okay, so like freshmen, eighth grade."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"- Eighth grade."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"And I remember somebody brought her in and said like,"
01:40:07;01:40:08;"oh, hey, Lil Mama,"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"these guys are in a band called Vampire Weekend."
01:40:10;01:40:13;"And I don't know if she just like was in kind of a guru mode"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"or maybe she just thought that we were,"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"and maybe she was right, we'd just come out."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"I just remember that she like immediately was like,"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"nice to meet you."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"And I was like, oh yeah, good to meet you too."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"And she just immediately said to us,"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"listen, never give up."
01:40:25;01:40:29;"If you believe in yourselves, big things can happen to you."
01:40:29;01:40:31;"And I want you to understand something."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"She talked about her experience and stuff like that"
01:40:32;01:40:36;"and say, but really don't give up, keep going."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Big things can happen, Baba."
01:40:38;01:40:38;"And then I think she walked out."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"I just remember being kind of bewildered."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"Like, did they tell her that we were-"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"- Just out of nowhere?"
01:40:43;01:40:44;"- Yeah, I was like, did they tell her"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"that we won a contest or something?"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"She kind of talked to us like we'd won a contest."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"And you know what?"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Maybe we had in a weird way."
01:40:51;01:40:52;"- Wow."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"- The only thing was she was also on her first album, but-"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"- You're like, but Lil Wayne's watching my music video"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"and he said it's interesting."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"- I didn't know that at the time."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"I gotta see this footage."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"I wonder if he says, who knows?"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Maybe I'll be disappointed."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Maybe he'll be like, this sucks."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"I can do a better version of this."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"- Which rapper was the first Lil?"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"- Oh, I mean-"
01:41:10;01:41:10;"- Cam?"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"- Can you believe how many people copied Lil?"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"- It's amazing."
01:41:14;01:41:14;"- And Big."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"- Lil really caught on."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"- Abner?"
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- There's still new Lils."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"- Obviously there's a little kid."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"I'm sure there's little people going back to the eighties."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Or there's probably even like even older."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"I bet there's like probably-"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"- I'm sure there's a, yeah, there's a history behind Lil."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"- A blue musician from the twenties or something."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"- Right."
01:41:27;01:41:31;"- But definitely Lil Wayne was one of the most influential"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"of the past 20 years."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Lil B."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"- Of the Lils."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"- Anyway, the song of the summer 2008 was"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"""I Kissed a Girl Katy Perry""."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Imagine if this song came out today."
01:41:40;01:41:41;"Do you remember when this song came out?"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Mm-hmm."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Iconic."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"- You were like a 13 or 14 or something?"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- Yeah."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"- So that's like an age where you really start"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"being more interested in pop culture."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Did you think the song was cool when it came out?"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"- I thought it was good."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- Did you find it edgy?"
01:41:55;01:41:59;"- I don't remember."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Maybe."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"- This is way more rock."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"- It was fun."
01:42:02;01:42:05;"- Yeah, Katy Perry had like a touch of emo in the early days."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"- I think Twitter would bury this song alive today."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"- Yeah."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"- I don't think if actually heard this."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"- Well Rita Ora like got trashed for that song."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"- That's right, yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"♪ I kissed a girl and I liked it ♪"
01:42:16;01:42:20;"♪ The taste of her cherry chapstick ♪"

01:42:40;01:42:42;"♪ I liked it ♪"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"- Wow."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"She's probably at the distance herself from this song."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"- I mean it's great."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"It's so good."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"- I don't know."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Has Katy been dropping this on set list lately?"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"- Not in the past couple of years, no."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"And actually I think I read something where she like"
01:42:54;01:42:57;"kind of looked back more and apologized a little bit"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"for this song."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"- Oh that's really too bad."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"We shouldn't have to apologize for things like this."
01:43:00;01:43:03;"- Why is she, I don't know the song at all."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Why should she feel shame about it?"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"- Well again, I don't wanna--"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"- 'Cause she's not queer."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"- I don't know how she identifies."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"I don't wanna speak to that."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"But I think most people assume"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"that she's a heterosexual person"
01:43:15;01:43:20;"and that this song is about a kind of heterosexual"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"fetishizing of--"
01:43:21;01:43:21;"- I get it."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"She's jumping on the bandwagon."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"- And even just to be like,"
01:43:24;01:43:24;"like it'd be one thing,"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"like write a song about love,"
01:43:27;01:43:28;"whatever that might be."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"And if it's from a non-heterosexual point of view, cool."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"But to be like, it's all edgy and it felt so wrong."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"It felt so right."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"- This is what Katy said."
01:43:37;01:43:40;"We've changed conversationally in the last 10 years."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"We've come a long way."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Bisexuality wasn't talked about back then"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"or any type of fluidity."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"If I had to write that song again,"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"I would probably make an edit on it."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"- Yeah, probably."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"But it's a shame."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"It's a great song."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"- I just felt like there was one chorus too many."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"(laughing)"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"- A quick edit."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"- It felt fine."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"It didn't feel problematic at all."
01:43:59;01:43:59;"- Yeah."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"- Would have been the line."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"- It didn't feel wrong."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"- So she's been keeping it up."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"Well, whatever, yeah."
01:44:03;01:44:04;"- It felt normal."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"- If she doesn't like how the song plays now,"
01:44:06;01:44:07;"then she shouldn't play it."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"I get that."
01:44:08;01:44:10;"Yeah, she's allowed to have regrets"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"and change about how she wants to portray herself"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"and her art."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"- So she dropped it off the set list?"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"- Yeah."
01:44:17;01:44:17;"Actually, I don't really know,"
01:44:17;01:44:18;"but let's assume she did."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"- Well, at least-- - Big hit."
01:44:19;01:44:22;"- At least we got that great 17 minute,"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"""I kissed a girl"" in 2014."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"- One of your biggest hits."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"- She really jammed it out. - Can't play it anymore."
01:44:27;01:44:28;"- Oh, she has so many hits."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"This probably isn't even top five biggest hits"
01:44:30;01:44:31;"for her anymore."
01:44:31;01:44:34;"- Imagine if Springsteen in the late '80s"
01:44:34;01:44:37;"had written one of his character songs"
01:44:37;01:44:38;"from the point of view of a gay man."
01:44:38;01:44:41;"- Is ""Streets of Philadelphia"" kind of that?"
01:44:41;01:44:41;"- Is it?"
01:44:41;01:44:44;"- Well, the movie is obviously about a gay man's struggle."
01:44:44;01:44:44;"- Is he dying?"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"And yeah, I was bruised and battered."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Yeah, I guess it kind of was."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"- I guess Bruce even back then had the foresight"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"not to be like--"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"- It felt so wrong."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"- Yeah. - It felt so right."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"- Right, it seemed like Bruce had the humanity to--"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"- He was sympathetic."
01:44:58;01:45:01;"- I would like to think as a fan that Bruce was like,"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"""Hey, I'm a heterosexual man from New Jersey."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"""I don't have the specific struggles"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"""of the character in this, you know,"
01:45:07;01:45:10;"""gay man dealing with the hatred of the world,"
01:45:10;01:45:11;"""but if I put myself in his shoes"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"""as I've been asked to do by the film's director,"
01:45:14;01:45:17;"""I can see a shared humanity in the struggle of all people."""
01:45:17;01:45:18;"- Beautifully put."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"- He won an Academy Award for that."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"- Yeah."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"- ""The night has fallen, I'm lying awake."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"""I can feel myself fading away."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"""So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss,"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"""or will we leave each other alone like this"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"""on the streets of Philadelphia?"""
01:45:30;01:45:33;"In some ways, the character in the ""Streets of Philadelphia"""
01:45:33;01:45:36;"song, it's very similar to like the ""Dancing in the Dark"" guy."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"And also, I do think that there's something cool about that"
01:45:39;01:45:42;"Bruce could say, it is kind of weird sometimes"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"where people from one group don't have sympathy"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"for a smaller group dealing with some bull (beep)"
01:45:46;01:45:49;"'cause obviously what the Philadelphia is about"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"is so specific in some ways, you know,"
01:45:51;01:45:55;"the hatred, the homophobia, and the AIDS crisis"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"and whatever, but you know, somebody like Bruce"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"hopefully could make somebody else say like,"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"anybody who's ever been a pawn in somebody else's game,"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"a cog in the machine, ought to have sympathy"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"for other people getting crushed"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"by something bigger than them."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"And actually, I am a Katy Perry fan,"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"but I will say specifically, ""Streets of Philadelphia"""
01:46:13;01:46:15;"is a better song than ""I Kissed a Girl,"" controversial."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"(explosion)"
01:46:17;01:46:20;"- First time that's ever been laid out."
01:46:20;01:46:23;"- Yeah, Katy Perry has other great songs."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"- ""Streets of Philadelphia"" versus ""I Kissed a Girl."""
01:46:26;01:46:27;"(laughing)"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"That's a TC, what a poll."
01:46:29;01:46:31;"- The number one song of this summer,"
01:46:31;01:46:34;"according to Billboard, Drake came damn close."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"He had number three and two,"
01:46:36;01:46:40;"but the biggest rapper of the summer of 2018 is not Drake."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Sorry, Seinfeld, it's not a Canadian."

01:48:00;01:48:01;"- So I would say we've talked about this song"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"six ways from Sunday."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"- That didn't feel natural."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"I don't know if you should use that again."

01:48:16;01:48:17;"- We could just say that."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- Well, the tense feels wrong with that."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"That's usually conditional."
01:48:21;01:48:22;"We are like, we could."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Would it be weird to say,"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"we've talked about this song til the cows came home."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"- No, that makes no sense."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"- Home they came."
01:48:29;01:48:31;"The cows came home."
01:48:31;01:48:33;"We talked about this song til we were blue in the face."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"- That's a classic."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"- Anyway, my point is that we've talked about this song"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"a lot here at Time Crisis."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"We all love Cardi B."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"She's America's sweetheart."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"She's the biggest rapper in America."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"She's killing it."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"And there is something so inherently likable about her"
01:48:47;01:48:50;"that it's like, kinda she brightens every song she's on."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"But I just wanna talk for a second about,"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"she's talking about all these things she likes,"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"you know, and things that everybody likes,"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"like those Balenciagas that look like socks"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"or getting big checks."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"You know, generally, these are consensus things"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"that people like."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"The least consensus thing in her list"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"is texts from my exes when they want a second chance."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- That's stressful."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- Yeah, some people would say that"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"that's the opposite of something you would like."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"- I don't want that."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"- You don't want that, Jake?"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"- Nope."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"- There wouldn't be a part of you"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"now you're a married man looking back"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"and you just get texts from somebody saying,"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"Jake, I know you're a married man now."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- We haven't talked in years."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"- I know you're an American painter and radio personality."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"(laughs)"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"You haven't heard from me for a long time,"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"but I just wanted you to know,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"if you would ever give me a second chance,"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"I just think you're a hell of a guy."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- That would stress me out so hard."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- Yeah, actually, it would stress me out too."
01:49:35;01:49:35;"What's the point?"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"It's actually 'cause Cardi B--"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"- So she gets it and she's just like, ha ha."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"- Cardi B's married too."
01:49:39;01:49:40;"- She just laughs at the dude."
01:49:40;01:49:42;"- She's married with a baby."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"And then Offset's like, what's so funny?"
01:49:44;01:49:48;"Oh, you know, it's just one of those things that I like."
01:49:48;01:49:49;"The Balenciagas?"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"- Nope."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- No texts from my ex."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Oh yeah?"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Why, did he say something funny?"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Well, he wants a second chance"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"and that filled me with a merriment."
01:49:57;01:50:01;"- Okay, I don't find that particularly amusing."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"- We're talking this over in therapy next week."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"(laughing)"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"Who's her husband?"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"- Offset."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"- His name is Offset?"
01:50:10;01:50:10;"- Jake, you are so--"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"- That is the best name ever."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"- Jake, you've been so checked out, man."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Offset is from--"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- Dude, I'm playing a Grateful Dead cover band."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"(laughing)"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"- Offset is from, you know, and that's one thing--"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"- Is it spelled like Offset?"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"- Yeah, that's another thing I'll say"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"about Richard Pictures."
01:50:25;01:50:27;"If you want a Grateful Dead cover band"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"that's not just, like if I had a Grateful Dead cover band,"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"it wouldn't be the same"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"because a lot of Grateful Dead cover bands"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"are kinda guys who know that Grateful Dead's"
01:50:34;01:50:37;"kinda trendy now, but they also know who Offset is."
01:50:37;01:50:40;"If you wanna see a Grateful Dead cover band"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"where the members know who Offset is"
01:50:41;01:50:44;"just about as well as Jerry Garcia knows who Offset is,"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"come see Richard Pictures."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"If you want guys who are walking off that stage"
01:50:48;01:50:51;"and are listening to 2018 pop hits,"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"then you can look elsewhere, my friend."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Offset's in Migos."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"- Okay."
01:50:55;01:50:56;"- Do you remember who Migos is?"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"- I mean, I know them from the top five on this show."
01:50:58;01:50:59;"- Right."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Do you know who Quavo is?"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"- No."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"I mean, I know, I've heard the name."
01:51:03;01:51:03;"- All right."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"- But I've never heard of Offset."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"- Did you know that Cardi B was with"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"one of the guys from Migos?"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"- No, I did not."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"- They're a power couple."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"They're on the cover of Rolling Stone together."
01:51:12;01:51:12;"Did you know they just--"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"- Not a magazine I respect."
01:51:14;01:51:16;"(laughing)"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"- Shots fired."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"- Shots fired late in the episode."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"- This show rules."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"- This is kinda old school,"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"like what stuff does Jake not know?"
01:51:27;01:51:27;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"That could be a whole album."
01:51:28;01:51:31;"- This is sort of like early TC."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"- That could be a whole album"
01:51:32;01:51:33;"just Jake not knowing (beep)"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"about modern culture."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"You know they just had a baby named Culture Kiari."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"- No."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"I knew that she was pregnant."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"I remember that."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- Okay, so you knew that."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- What's the name of the kid?"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"- Culture Kiari, I don't know what the last name is."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"- Culture is the first name."
01:51:46;01:51:47;"- Yeah."
01:51:47;01:51:47;"- With a K."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"- Yeah, actually."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"- That's kind of a cool first name."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"Never heard that before."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"- It is cool."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"I wonder what the nickname is."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"- Culch."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"- Culch."
01:51:55;01:51:56;"- Culch is rough."
01:51:56;01:51:58;"- Hey, was it a boy or a girl?"
01:51:58;01:51:59;"- A girl."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"Or I could also imagine if your name's Culture Kiari,"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"probably at a certain age you might say,"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"I'd rather be Kiari."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Or it depends who you are."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"My parents named me Ezra Michael"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"because they thought back in 1984,"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Ezra seemed like a slightly weird name."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"They said maybe I think it was too weird."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"And I might wanna be Big Mike."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"- Hey Mike."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"- Hey Mike."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"- You have so much of a Michael essence"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"that this really makes a lot of sense."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"- Also, I wouldn't wanna be Michael."
01:52:24;01:52:25;"- No, you wouldn't wanna be Michael."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"- Mike."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"- I'm not a Mike though."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"I might have some Michael energy, but not Mike."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"- No, you have Michael energy."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"You're not, you shouldn't be named Michael."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"- Then this really would sound like a sports show."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"You're listening to Mike and Jake on beat."
01:52:35;01:52:38;"(laughing)"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"You're listening to Big Mike and Jake."
01:52:40;01:52:45;"- Is Cardi B so charming that when Offset sees her laughing"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"and smiling about a text from her ex"
01:52:47;01:52:50;"wanting a second chance, that he would be charmed by it?"
01:52:50;01:52:51;"- He can't always be charming."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"- Yeah, especially when you're known to be charming."
01:52:53;01:52:55;"There's a lot of pressure on Cardi B to be charming."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"- Truly in like an intense argument"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"and still being like, well, you're charming."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"- She's just like, ""To Offset off."""
01:53:02;01:53:05;"And he's like, ""Okay, fine, Cardi."""
01:53:05;01:53:06;"(laughing)"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"- She's just riffing."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"Anyway, yeah, that one stuck with me."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"The one weird one."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"I like texts from my exes."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"But I guess that's also the Cardi B character"
01:53:15;01:53:18;"versus the person at home."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"- Cardi B."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"- I don't see another person going home."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"- She doesn't seem like someone who can turn it off."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"- She might not have even written the lyric."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"There's a lot of people credit on the song."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"So maybe somebody pitched it to her."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"""Hey, Cardi, how about this?"""
01:53:29;01:53:31;"And she's like, ""Yeah, sure."""
01:53:31;01:53:33;"But even just culturally, forget about her as an individual."
01:53:33;01:53:37;"Like Jake, I also feel like that just sounds stressful."
01:53:37;01:53:37;"It'd be one thing if she was like,"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"""I like texts from my exes when they say"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"""that we're all good."""
01:53:41;01:53:42;"(laughing)"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"- When they're just checking in."
01:53:44;01:53:47;"- I like texts from my exes who have now"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"become dear friends."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"- Who wouldn't like that?"
01:53:51;01:53:54;"Anyway, those are the songs of the summer, everybody."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"- Hell of a top five."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"- Hell of a top five."
01:53:56;01:53:59;"We were zigging and zagging through decades"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"and that was a true time crisis."
01:54:01;01:54:04;"- A lot of inventions conceived of."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"- Yeah."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"- Six ways till sundown."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"- Six ways till Sunday."
01:54:08;01:54:08;"- Sunday."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"- I wanna get some more phrases on deck"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"for that specific tense."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"- I'm not a phrase person."
01:54:14;01:54:17;"I thought the phrase was play it by year"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"instead of ear, like until last month."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"- Oh no."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- That's amazing."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"I love that."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"- Play it by year?"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"- Yeah, and actually, you know what?"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Yeah, and you know what?"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"It makes more sense."
01:54:27;01:54:27;"Sue me, okay?"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"It makes more sense."
01:54:29;01:54:29;"- Play it, I guess--"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"- Not really."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"- No, it really does."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"- I guess play it by year makes more sense?"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Yeah."
01:54:34;01:54:34;"- Explain."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"- Play it by year, you know?"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Like maybe it'll take a year,"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"but we'll figure it out."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"- Okay, I buy that."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"- Play it by ear, it still doesn't make sense to me."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"I have to sit with it for--"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"- I mean, play it by ear does not make any sense."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- No, it does not."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- It just means that you're taking in the information"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"in real time and reacting to it."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"- By ear."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"- So you're taking it in through your ear, is that?"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"- Well, yeah, look, you're making a fair point."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"When you actually look at it,"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"it's a little harder to say."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"I guess I kind of thought of it,"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"this is my guess, is that it's kind of like,"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"we could play it by the printed schedule."
01:55:04;01:55:07;"Or you play it by ear, meaning that in real time"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"we take it in and we react,"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"and the ear is a sensory organ."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Yeah, why is it play it by ear and not play it by eye?"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Seinfeld, let's get a number crunch on this."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- Isn't it like playing the piano,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"you're not using the sheet music?"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"- Oh, yeah, oh my God."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- Wow."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- Yes, that's gotta be it."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"- Play it by ear is a good music phrase."
01:55:25;01:55:28;"Like when you're playing it by ear in music,"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"and then for the rest of us."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"- Yeah, there you go."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"- I could also see your definition,"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"'cause if somebody was like,"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"""What are you doing tomorrow?"""
01:55:35;01:55:38;"You might say, ""Well, at 9.15,"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"""I've got a doctor's appointment,"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"""and then at 10.30,"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"""I was gonna get a coffee with my friend,"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"""and then I had to go do a few hours"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"""at Quiznos in the afternoon,"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"""and then whatever."""
01:55:50;01:55:52;"You might have a sense of it."
