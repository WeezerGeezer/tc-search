00:00;00:07;">> Time crisis. The crisis crew is in New York. Ezra Koenig is warming up. I'm here"
00:07;00:12;"with Seinfeld. >> Hey, what's up?"
00:12;00:17;">> We're about to witness the most incredible show. Three sets, folks. Three sets."
00:17;00:22;">> But before we get into all that, Ezra's going to take us around the city to show us"
00:22;00:28;"some iconic locations before the show starts. And we're going to the Seinfeld Diner."
00:28;00:35;">> This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. Beats for one."
00:35;00:42;">> One. >> One."
00:42;00:49;">> One."
00:56;01:03;">> What's up? Time Crisis back again. Very special, strange episode. We're going to"
01:03;01:10;"be sitting here, the whole Crisis crew, just about. At least the West Coast edition. Cousin"
01:31;01:36;"Astor's at a wedding. Despot might be coming. He's sitting here at Tom's Restaurant, aka"
01:36;01:42;"the Seinfeld Diner. But to me, it's the Columbia Diner. Now we're inside. It doesn't look like"
01:42;01:44;"Seinfeld, you know? The interior is totally different."
01:44;01:49;">> Yeah, it's shockingly different. >> But anyway, we're here. This is the weekend."
01:49;01:55;"Father of the Bride comes out, playing Webster Hall tomorrow. And we're waiting to order."
01:55;02:00;"And that's the tea. What's up, Jake? >> Not much. How are you? Congrats on the"
02:00;02:03;"album, by the way. >> Oh, thank you. You happy to be in New York?"
02:03;02:04;">> So-so. >> Well, the sun's out now."
02:04;02:09;">> Not a fan of the city. But I'm here for work. >> You to New York is like my dad to"
02:09;02:11;"California. >> Exactly."
02:11;02:14;">> Take it or leave it. >> Yeah. Had a fun time this morning with Nick."
02:14;02:18;"We walked around. >> What was your favorite part of what we saw"
02:18;02:20;"in New York? >> Shooting that Domino's. That was the highlight."
02:20;02:24;">> Got a tight shot of a local Domino's. >> Is that going to become a painting?"
02:24;02:27;">> Probably not. But maybe, you know. It'll go in the archives."
02:27;02:31;">> Do you feel good just as a Connecticut guy, just being a little, just that much closer"
02:31;02:34;"to the home state? >> Well, I think we've discussed this. I have"
02:34;02:37;"no love for CT or the East Coast. >> I thought, well, I know you have no-"
02:37;02:39;">> So I have no- >> I've never heard you quite put it that"
02:39;02:43;"way. I know you have no respect for CT as a musical homeland."
02:43;02:50;">> Well, I lived in Connecticut until I was 18, and now I'm 42. I don't have any sort"
02:50;02:53;"of sentimental attachment to Connecticut. >> Yeah."
02:53;02:57;">> You know, like the East Coast in the summer with, like, the maple trees, beautiful deciduous"
02:57;03:02;"forest. I can get down with it. It's gorgeous, but it doesn't, like, stir within me a yearning"
03:02;03:05;"for, like, childhood or, like, ancient memories. >> Yeah."
03:05;03:08;">> Because I feel like New Jersey's that way for you, where you, like-"
03:08;03:11;">> Well, and the whole East Coast. >> Right. You have, like, a visceral-"
03:11;03:14;">> Yeah. >> Emotional response to it."
03:14;03:17;">> That'd be a good song title, Deciduous Forest. It's a Jake song."
03:17;03:22;">> Let's write it. >> I've got respect for Deciduous Forest."
03:22;03:24;"No yearning. >> Oh, that's the title, No Yearning."
03:24;03:26;">> Yeah, No Yearning. >> That's the title."
03:26;03:32;">> No yearning for Deciduous Forest. >> Mad respect, but no love."
03:32;03:37;">> This is so- >> You know who else wrote a song in this"
03:37;03:38;"diner? >> In this diner?"
03:38;03:40;">> Oh, Susanne Vega. >> Susanne Vega."
03:40;03:42;">> Oh, really? >> See, like, when that song was, like, really"
03:42;03:48;"big in the 90s, doo doo doo doo doo doo, because this place is called Tom's Diner, that was,"
03:48;03:51;"like, neck and neck with Seinfeld for, like, the reference of this diner."
03:51;03:56;">> Wait, sorry, I'm missing the Tom's connection. >> I am sitting at Tom's Diner."
03:56;03:59;">> Oh, really? >> Then something about Deciduous Forest, I"
03:59;04:03;"don't remember the rest, but the song is called Tom's Diner. You know that song, right?"
04:03;04:05;">> Yeah, I know the song. >> It was acapella, and then-"
04:05;04:07;">> It's called Tom's Diner? >> Yeah."
04:07;04:09;">> How did I miss that? >> Are you familiar with Susanne Vega?"
04:09;04:12;">> Yeah, sure, a little bit. >> Her song Luca?"
04:12;04:14;">> I don't know the full catalog, but I know that song."
04:14;04:17;">> She's like a one-hit wonder, right? >> Whoa, whoa, whoa."
04:17;04:21;">> Did she write that after Seinfeld was popular? >> No, no, no, no."
04:21;04:24;">> No, it was before Seinfeld was popular. >> So it was 80s then."
04:24;04:26;">> It might have been- >> Concurrent."
04:26;04:27;">> Seinfeld. >> Yeah."
04:27;04:30;">> Do you have your mobile rig with you? Can we get a mobile number crunch here at Tom's"
04:30;04:32;"Diner? >> Tom's Diner."
04:32;04:34;">> It's Seinfeld. >> 1982."
04:34;04:38;">> Oh, it's early. >> So that's six years before Seinfeld started."
04:38;04:41;">> No, no, no, that song didn't come out in 1982."
04:41;04:45;">> It was written in 1982. Oh, released in 1987. Wikipedia, what are you doing?"
04:45;04:48;">> Yeah, good luck. >> Oh, so it came out a year-"
04:48;04:52;">> When did the DNA remix, that's the popular version, because their original version is"
04:52;04:57;"straight up acapella, so it was perfect for remixers. When did that come out?"
04:57;05:04;">> '88, which is a year before Seinfeld. >> Yeah, so Susanne Vega really put this place"
05:04;05:08;"on the map a little bit. I think she lived up here. Maybe, did she go to Columbia or"
05:08;05:11;"something? >> Oh, she went to nearby Barnard College."
05:11;05:14;"Do you know Barnard? Barnard College? >> Yeah, heard of it."
05:14;05:19;">> Private women's liberal college. >> I mean, I have conflicted feelings about"
05:19;05:24;"Columbia because on the one hand, who cares? But on the other hand, yes, Seinfeld. Barnard"
05:24;05:26;"is a part of Columbia University. >> Oh, it is?"
05:26;05:30;">> Yeah, it's an all-women's college. Oh, now it's time to order. Yeah, we can order."
05:30;05:31;">> We're ready to order. >> We can order."
05:31;05:38;">> I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter"
05:38;05:45;"for the man to pour the coffee, and he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue,"
05:45;05:50;"he is looking out the window at somebody coming in."
05:50;06:19;"[ Music ]"
06:19;06:21;">> Excuse me? >> Cumbersome."
06:21;06:25;">> Oh, yeah, do you sell the T-shirts that everybody's wearing? Yeah, nice. Okay."
06:25;06:27;">> You're going to pick one of those. >> In the hat."
06:27;06:30;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> At restaurants that sell merch, it seems"
06:30;06:34;"like really funny to order it from the waiter or waitress."
06:34;06:38;">> Right. >> But also, it seems weird to have to -- you're"
06:38;06:39;"paying -- >> Separate transaction."
06:39;06:43;">> Yeah, then you got to go to, like, the counter. Just like, ""Oh, yeah, thank you."
06:43;06:49;"I'll get a cheeseburger, a side of fries, the long-sleeve Tom's Diner wrapped tea, and"
06:49;06:52;"one white dad hat."" >> A round of dad hats for the crew."
06:52;06:53;">> Yeah. >> For the table."
06:53;06:59;">> Do you have any specials today? Oh, yeah, we have the new Kith Nike Seinfeld Air Max"
06:59;07:05;"98s. Okay, cool, I'll take that. Just so you know, sir, it's $450. Fine."
07:05;07:07;">> Oh, and a coffee. >> I'm down."
07:07;07:09;">> Oh, and a coffee. >> Side of cottage cheese."
07:09;07:13;">> I think that'll happen in our lifetime, some, like, Hypebeast's restaurant."
07:13;07:17;">> I think you're giving Supreme some ideas. >> Oh, yeah, that'll probably happen. Supreme"
07:17;07:20;"will just open a restaurant, maybe only for, like, a week or something. Wait, what about"
07:20;07:24;"this? A Supreme restaurant with no food. But you have to still come -- you have to wait"
07:24;07:28;"in line, like a pop-in restaurant, then you got to sit down at the booth, then the waiter"
07:28;07:32;"comes over, gives you nothing, no water, and then you say, ""Can I take your order?"""
07:32;07:34;">> Can you make a reservation? >> Do you pay?"
07:34;07:37;">> First come, first serve. Yeah, no, you pay. They bring you a check and everything."
07:37;07:41;"But I think also he'll -- you know that there's going to be certain things ahead of time."
07:41;07:44;"They'll do, like, a public menu, but then he'll come around, like, at an Italian restaurant"
07:44;07:48;"with, like, the special board, and then you'll be like, ""Oh, holy [bleep] they got that"
07:48;07:54;"grill?"" And he's like, ""For $1,500, I'll take it."" Then they bring it for you and it to"
07:54;07:57;"go, bag, and then you leave. >> We got to do this for TC merch."
07:57;07:59;">> Okay. >> [Bleep] Supreme."
07:59;08:01;">> Yeah, actually, Supreme, you can't have that idea."
08:01;08:04;">> You hear that? >> Well, it's a nice day in New York. The sun's coming out. It was"
08:04;08:10;"rainy this morning. Oh, you know, we can go horse around late. We should go see my tag."
08:10;08:14;">> Your what? >> I think the statute of limitations is passed. I used to be kind of scared to"
08:14;08:17;"talk about it. You know, like, Banksy? >> Sure."
08:17;08:21;">> I used to be, like, that kind of guy. I was doing street art, graffiti, things of"
08:21;08:23;"that nature. >> With, like, cultural commentary?"
08:23;08:25;">> Is this, like, sophomore year of college? >> Yeah."
08:25;08:28;">> What kind of statements were you making? >> I don't even know if Banksy was out yet."
08:28;08:31;"When Banksy come out -- he came out, like, what, a couple years ago?"
08:31;08:35;">> 2014. >> Your stuff was, like, proto-Banksy."
08:35;08:40;">> Yeah. I feel like Banksy came out around the same time as Lorde, if I remember correctly."
08:40;08:43;">> Came out. >> Because it was the summer. You heard Royals everywhere, and everybody"
08:43;08:48;"shut up about Banksy. So, yeah, before him, I was doing street art. I was tagging [bleep]"
08:48;08:50;"up. >> You're a real innovator."
08:50;08:54;">> I was using a spray can to paint a bike, and I said, ""I could use this for art."" So"
08:54;09:01;"I made stencils for maybe, like, a month, and my little stencil was a Lacoste alligator,"
09:01;09:03;"which, at the time -- >> Wow."
09:03;09:07;">> I thought was kind of novel. It was, like, a little before this current wave of, like,"
09:07;09:12;"huge Lacoste alligators and stuff, and everything is branded to the extreme. I thought I was"
09:12;09:18;"being somewhat creative. I mean, about 20,000 other people had similar ideas. But I don't"
09:18;09:22;"know. I feel, like, a little weird about it. But I hope the statute of limitations is passed."
09:22;09:27;"Otherwise -- and I think it's cool, honestly. But for a long time, they were doing construction"
09:27;09:31;"outside my room in my dorm. So, you know, already, I'm living with that."
09:31;09:33;">> That sounds terrible. >> Yeah."
09:33;09:36;">> But they start at, like, 7 in the morning? >> So, basically, right outside of my window"
09:36;09:42;"was, like, this giant scaffolding. So I realized, like, I suddenly had, like, a balcony. As"
09:42;09:45;"I think back, it was probably kind of dangerous. I could just open my window. And, like, sometimes"
09:45;09:49;"I'd just be, like, in my bed, just, like, see, like, the dudes working. Like, eye contact."
09:49;09:51;">> Oh. >> Eye contact."
09:51;09:55;">> So one time they weren't there. And I opened the window. And I, like, went out onto the"
09:55;09:56;"scaffolding. >> Yeah."
09:56;10:00;">> And I was, like, wow. When they're not working, it's, like, kind of like a chill"
10:00;10:02;"little balcony I got here. >> What floor were you on?"
10:02;10:05;">> It wasn't high. Second. >> Okay. Was it stable?"
10:05;10:07;">> What? >> Was it stable? Was it safe?"
10:07;10:11;">> It was very unsafe. No, I think -- I don't know."
10:11;10:14;">> Well, they were working on it. >> I'm pretty risk-averse when it comes to"
10:14;10:18;"heights and stuff. Maybe because I was, like, on the scaffolding, I didn't really feel like"
10:18;10:22;"I was tagging the building. I was, like, cloistered from the rest of the building. So then I was,"
10:22;10:27;"like, oh, let me try my stencil. So I just did it on the ledge. And then the scaffolding's"
10:27;10:31;"up forever. Then eventually they take it down. And I kind of look, and there's just, like,"
10:31;10:36;"this -- it's pretty subtle. Just this small black Lacoste alligator on the building. And"
10:36;10:42;"in years past, I would go check, and it was still there almost ten years later. So maybe"
10:42;10:44;"we should go check now. >> Love it."
10:44;10:48;">> What are they going to do, take away my diploma? [Bleep] you, Columbia."
10:48;10:52;">> You know how Banksy art gets chiseled out of walls and stuff and put into museums and"
10:52;10:53;"stuff? >> Oh, yeah."
10:53;10:56;">> I feel like now that this is public, there's a very high risk --"
10:56;10:58;">> I feel like I've said this before. >> Okay."
10:58;11:00;">> Although I was on the record. >> It's news to me."
11:00;11:02;">> It's news to you guys? >> Yeah, I hadn't heard it."
11:02;11:08;">> I feel like there's that famous Beastie Boys tag on the top of the Capitol Records"
11:08;11:10;"building. >> Oh, yeah, I've seen that."
11:10;11:14;">> I feel like this is like that. >> Yeah, if I was Columbia, I'd put a plaque"
11:14;11:16;"next to it. >> Is it visible from the street? Like, can"
11:16;11:18;"we check it out? >> Yeah, yeah, we should go check it out"
11:18;11:22;"after this. Okay, but here comes the food. >> Here comes the food. All right. We should"
11:22;11:25;"check back in? >> Yeah, yeah, so let's take a break. And"
11:25;11:27;"here's ""Lord with Royals."""
12:31;12:40;">> So we left Tom's Diner. Now we're standing in front of my old dorm, Ruggles."
12:40;12:43;"Jake, I remember you visited me in this dorm back in the day."
12:43;12:46;">> That's tight. >> Did we tell this story on top basis?"
12:46;12:49;">> I think we did. >> This is just like a weird memory I have"
12:49;12:54;"is that the dorm, I think true at most colleges, there's a security guard, so you have to sign"
12:54;12:59;"in non-students. So Jake came to visit me, so I came down to sign him in, and I remember"
12:59;13:06;"the security guard looked at your name, and she said, ""Longstretch, huh?"" And you were"
13:06;13:09;"like, ""Yeah?"" And she goes... >> Longstretch, ma'am."
13:09;13:14;">> And then she chuckled to herself and said, ""I'm sorry, I'm just perverted."" And I was..."
13:14;13:18;"I remember at the time, I've always thought about that, just kind of like, I kind of get"
13:18;13:22;"it. I mean, there's a lot of names that sound a lot pervier than Longstretch."
13:22;13:24;">> Yeah. >> But there's something about, she said,"
13:24;13:29;"""Longstretch, I'm perverted."" And I was like, whatever I'm picturing is not very sexy, but"
13:29;13:34;"most people say, ""Longstretch."" >> Yeah, like a very stretched out male member."
13:34;13:36;"Is that what she's referring to? >> Yeah."
13:36;13:38;">> Yeah. >> Anyway. So now we're standing in front,"
13:38;13:43;"and my little tag is still there. I also think it kind of suits it. It's tasteful. It survived"
13:43;13:47;"13, 14 years now. >> And then it's specific to the Lacoste logo."
13:47;13:49;">> Yeah. >> It's not just like a crocodile. It's like"
13:49;13:51;"you're... >> Yeah, that was my take."
13:51;13:55;">> You were like, ""I'm gonna tag the Lacoste logo around campus."""
13:55;13:57;">> Seemed like a good idea at the time. >> What year?"
13:57;14:01;">> '05 or '06. >> I wonder how buzzed about this is. Like,"
14:01;14:03;"do people know this as a sort of like a small landmark?"
14:03;14:06;">> Yeah, I don't know. I feel like I've talked about it before. I have memories of like standing"
14:06;14:09;"in front of the same place with like a journalist or something, but I haven't been up here in"
14:09;14:13;"such a long time. But I think it's tasteful. I think most people just don't notice."
14:13;14:15;">> Yeah. >> But anyway, you know, they didn't compensate"
14:15;14:19;"me for disrupting my education with the noisy..."
14:19;14:22;">> Construction. >> Construction happening. So I think it's"
14:22;14:24;"fair. >> I feel like you should update it in some"
14:24;14:27;"way. Like if you could go back and add like a hoverboard or something."
14:27;14:29;">> The Harmony Hall snake? >> Yeah."
14:29;14:34;">> Well, I feel also like I think when I was doing that, the commonality or the commonness,"
14:34;14:39;"I don't know what the word, yeah, commonness of people just like doing stencils to like"
14:39;14:43;"promote an album on the sidewalk, it wasn't quite happening yet. Because now I look at"
14:43;14:47;"this and I'm like, it seems a little like a viral marketing campaign now. Whereas at"
14:47;14:50;"the time, you know, I felt like I was like proto Banksy."
14:50;14:53;">> Or like a Shepard fairy. >> Yeah, maybe a little Shepard fairy."
14:53;14:57;">> Like the Obey stickers with Andre. Yeah. >> Just for the record, you're not Banksy."
14:57;15:02;"Right? >> Well, I mean, I did this tag in 2005."
15:02;15:07;"Banksy didn't come out till what do we say? Oh, yeah, 2013 when Royals came out by Lord."
15:07;15:11;"So who's to say? >> He's had a pretty short career, actually."
15:11;15:16;">> Yeah, he knows how to make a splash. He's been everywhere for the past six years. But"
15:16;15:20;"yeah, it's interesting when you think what was going on between my first tag and that"
15:20;15:25;"summer at 13. I don't know. >> He did some great work on that Lord campaign."
15:25;15:29;">> Yeah. >> Just for color, we are like on the move"
15:29;15:33;"right now, walking across the streets, dodging cars and stuff."
15:33;15:46;">> Hey, how's it going? Yeah, sure. Oh, that's cool. That's all good. Yeah. Sure. Oh, you're"
15:46;15:51;"riding these. >> Hold the mic."
15:51;15:55;">> Do you listen to time crisis? >> Billy on the street."
15:55;16:00;">> Oh, awesome. Nice to meet you. Good luck with your thesis."
16:00;16:03;">> I'm so sorry. >> Amazing."
16:03;16:06;">> Nice to meet you. Thank you. Thanks so much."
16:06;16:12;">> All right. Let's walk up these steps. >> I remember life as a stranger."
16:12;16:18;">> I should put out my own version. >> Jake, live at Columbia University. You"
16:18;16:22;"know who played at Columbia University in the late 60s when my dad went here?"
16:22;16:25;">> Dad? >> The dad."
16:25;16:27;">> Hell yeah. >> Is this all the graduation stuff?"
16:27;16:29;">> This is the graduation set up. >> You can't really see the campus as well"
16:29;16:32;"because they put up all these tents. >> I've never been to this part of the campus."
16:32;16:35;">> You walk on here and it's like a real campus now."
16:35;16:39;">> And they film part of Ghostbusters here. >> Oh, yeah. And Spider-Man."
16:39;16:42;">> Sort of the beginning when they're launching the whole business."
16:42;16:45;">> Oh, got it. >> This is where whoever plays Harold Ramis's"
16:45;16:49;"office is here or something? >> I think Ackroyd."
16:49;16:52;">> Yeah. >> No, it's Bill Murray."
16:52;16:54;">> Peter Venkman has an office. >> Come on, Jake."
16:54;16:59;">> So it's a big campus. I think it might have been '68 or '69."
16:59;17:03;"The dead played outdoors on campus. >> That's awesome."
17:03;17:07;"How guerrilla do you think it was? >> By the looks of the pictures, it kind of"
17:07;17:12;"looks like rolled up on a truck or something. >> Flatbed truck."
17:12;17:18;">> But those are also the days when students were taking over buildings and that kind of thing."
17:18;17:22;">> Did your dad see the show? >> No, I think he said he kind of heard it and was like..."
17:22;17:25;">> Not for me. >> Yeah. Where are the songs, man?"
17:25;17:29;"You know, this is pre-Working Man's Dead. >> Pre-American Beauty."
17:58;18:07;"What's wrong with me and my baby?"
18:07;18:16;"We ain't been getting down like we used to do."
18:16;18:22;"I mean, it's pretty good now."
18:22;18:39;"I was a child when it didn't work too well."
18:39;18:46;"I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand."
18:46;18:54;"And I told her my story. I told her what was going on."
18:54;19:08;"And she told me, man, she said, all you need, all you need, all you need, all you got to have,"

19:41;19:43;"- For your big spring concerts when you were here,"
19:43;19:47;"remember who played anything memorable?"
19:47;19:49;"- I remember one of the big spring concerts"
19:49;19:51;"was an early Kanye performance."
19:51;19:52;"- Wow."
19:52;19:54;"- So they would set up a big stage right there,"
19:54;19:56;"and then we later came and played one,"
19:56;20:00;"and the bill was the Clips and Vampire Weekend."
20:00;20:02;"- That's a strong COVID line."
20:02;20:04;"- Shout out to any Columbia students"
20:04;20:06;"who caught that one and done bill."
20:06;20:08;"- I remember Lewis and Clark College,"
20:08;20:12;"the original BTS played one of the spring flings."
20:12;20:14;"- The original lineup of the Korean boy band BTS?"
20:14;20:18;"- The original BTS played in like '98, '99."
20:18;20:20;"- Yeah, that was a different lineup."
20:20;20:20;"- Different lineup."
20:20;20:21;"- They got some young guys in now."
20:21;20:24;"They're pretty good, but it's not the same as the--"
20:24;20:26;"- There's no original members of, anymore."
20:26;20:28;"- Yeah, the interesting thing,"
20:28;20:30;"people talk about BTS as being K-pop,"
20:30;20:32;"but the original lineup was actually"
20:32;20:34;"a bunch of American dudes from Idaho,"
20:34;20:35;"and then just over the years,"
20:35;20:38;"operations started moving to Korea,"
20:38;20:40;"started swapping people out one by one,"
20:40;20:41;"and the next thing you know,"
20:41;20:43;"it's all 24-year-old guys from Korea,"
20:43;20:46;"but honestly, I like to see that kind of evolution"
20:46;20:47;"in a group."
20:47;20:50;"They ditched the guitars, they started dancing."
20:50;20:51;"- They've maintained the brand."
20:51;20:54;"- Yeah, anyway, so shout out to Built to Spill"

21:36;21:40;"- When was the last time you were back, actually, on campus?"
21:40;21:44;"- I have this memory of a couple years ago,"
21:44;21:46;"like me and Rashida were uptown,"
21:46;21:48;"and we took a walk, showed her my haunts,"
21:48;21:51;"like, ""Oh, I got a bagel there once,"" that kind of thing."
21:51;21:52;"(laughing)"
21:52;21:53;"- Once. - You know?"
21:53;21:55;"It's a beautiful day, though."
21:55;21:56;"The sun really came out."
21:56;21:59;"Oh yeah, I see some of the kids in their graduation gowns."

22:03;22:07;"- You think Columbia will ask you to give a commencement?"
22:07;22:09;"- That doesn't seem up my alley."
22:09;22:09;"- Would you say no?"
22:09;22:11;"- I think you'd be great at it, though."
22:11;22:13;"- I gave a speech at my high school graduation."
22:13;22:15;"I was the class speaker."
22:15;22:17;"And I thought-- - What year?"
22:17;22:18;"- That was '02."
22:18;22:19;"- Oh, like when you graduated."
22:19;22:20;"- When I graduated, yeah."
22:20;22:22;"I feel like Columbia,"
22:22;22:24;"no, because my instinct would be to get up there"
22:24;22:26;"and kind of roast Columbia."
22:26;22:28;"- Sure."
22:28;22:29;"College is pointless, it's overpriced."
22:29;22:31;"- And I went once with,"
22:31;22:35;"I went with Rashida when she spoke at Harvard."
22:35;22:36;"And I met, there was some really nice kids"
22:36;22:37;"who were part of the thing."
22:37;22:39;"I was sitting there and I was like,"
22:39;22:41;"""I don't know if this is a good vibe."""
22:41;22:43;"- Do you remember who gave your commencement speech?"
22:43;22:46;"- Oh yeah, Senator John McCain, rest in peace."
22:46;22:49;"Well, his daughter Megan was the same year as me."
22:49;22:50;"We didn't really know each other,"
22:50;22:53;"but I remember seeing them walk around once or twice."
22:53;22:56;"So McCain gave a speech, I'm pretty sure,"
22:56;22:59;"I feel like one of the student organizations"
22:59;23:02;"passed out some kind of protest buttons."
23:02;23:04;"I think I wore one, but."
23:04;23:05;"You know, it's funny, just the other day,"
23:05;23:06;"I can't even remember how this came up,"
23:06;23:09;"like me and Baio were joking about,"
23:09;23:12;"we were talking about the last time Tool had an album out."
23:12;23:14;"And he was like, it was '06, it was May '06."
23:14;23:16;"So then I just, for whatever reason,"
23:16;23:17;"I didn't know that album."
23:17;23:19;"I mean, I like Tool, but I don't really know that album."
23:19;23:21;"So I was like, that's like right when I graduated college."
23:21;23:23;"I mean, you're older than Baio."
23:23;23:26;"And then it became this extended fantasy"
23:26;23:29;"of just me wearing my blue graduation gown and cap,"
23:29;23:34;"rocking a Sony Walkman, just blasting the new Tool album"
23:34;23:36;"while I'm waiting in line to get my diploma."
23:36;23:38;"And I feel like this probably happened a lot in the '80s,"
23:38;23:39;"maybe in the '90s a little bit,"
23:39;23:42;"just walking up to the president of Columbia,"
23:42;23:43;"it's like there to shake my hand."
23:43;23:45;"And in front of everybody, I pull one ear off,"
23:45;23:46;"and I'm just like, what'd you say?"
23:46;23:47;"Ha, sorry man, just listening to the new Tool."
23:47;23:50;"Hey, thanks a lot, Prez, appreciate it."
23:50;23:51;"Later, losers."
23:51;23:53;"(laughing)"
23:53;23:55;"I'm gonna start telling that story in interviews"
23:55;23:56;"as if it's true."
23:56;23:57;"Anytime anybody's like, got any good Columbia stories,"
23:57;23:59;"I'll be like, you know what's funny?"
23:59;24:01;"Right when Vampire Weekend started,"
24:01;24:03;"couple months later, graduate,"
24:03;24:05;"as you know, the new Tool album came out that month,"
24:05;24:07;"and I just couldn't stop listening to it."
24:07;24:09;"So here I am at my graduation,"
24:09;24:11;"just (beep) glued to this thing, man."
24:11;24:12;"And I walk up on stage, and I got the headphone,"
24:12;24:14;"yeah, I'm gonna start telling that as if it's fact."
24:14;24:17;"- Do you think Megan caught any early VW shows?"
24:17;24:18;"- I don't know."
24:18;24:20;"As you can imagine, I've made disagreements"
24:20;24:22;"with her politically."
24:22;24:23;"And one time she said some kind of wild (beep)"
24:23;24:25;"on Twitter, and I said something."
24:25;24:27;"- About me?"
24:27;24:28;"- Yeah, no, not about Vampire Weekend."
24:28;24:29;"- About the world at large?"
24:29;24:33;"- Yeah, just wild stuff about Israel."
24:33;24:34;"- Oh, like all that recent garbage?"
24:34;24:35;"- Yeah, yeah."
24:35;24:37;"And I don't know her, I don't know why."
24:37;24:40;"Maybe just 'cause you see someone walking down the street"
24:40;24:43;"with their dad, you kind of feel like,"
24:43;24:45;"oh yeah, they seem like a normal person."
24:45;24:47;"You know, you hope somewhere in there"
24:47;24:50;"there's some understanding, but who knows?"
24:50;24:51;"You get very different politics."
24:51;24:54;"So anyway, after I kind of clapped back,"
24:54;24:56;"I wasn't trying to be mean, but it was just wild."
24:56;24:58;"I felt like I had to say something."
24:58;25:01;"Then a few people sent me some old tweets of hers"
25:01;25:02;"where she was like, Vampire Weekend, what a cool band,"
25:02;25:04;"and they went to Columbia."
25:04;25:07;"And I was like, well, at least you got good taste in music."
25:07;25:08;"That's all I can say."
25:08;25:12;"- I mean, someone sent this to me recently,"
25:12;25:16;"a photograph of Neil Young hanging out with Trump in 2014."
25:16;25:18;"- Whoa, oh yeah, and what's that about?"
25:18;25:20;"- Maybe Neil was there talking to Trump about Pono,"
25:20;25:24;"but basically, I'm kind of joking about the Pono thing."
25:24;25:26;"But Donald was just like, Neil Young,"
25:26;25:27;"one of my favorite musicians."
25:27;25:28;"- Oh yeah."
25:28;25:29;"- And just like, all right."
25:29;25:30;"- You also can hear him saying that"
25:30;25:32;"literally about anybody he meets."
25:32;25:35;"- And then there's a picture of Don Jr., I think,"
25:35;25:38;"with a Grateful Dead poster in his childhood bedroom."
25:38;25:40;"- I love that, I love that image."
25:40;25:41;"I use that to promote a Richard picture."
25:41;25:42;"- Oh really?"
25:42;25:45;"I wonder if there was ever a discussion just like,"
25:45;25:50;"Trump, Don Jr., just blasting some dead,"
25:50;25:53;"and then Trump coming in, what is this, Neil Young?"
25:53;25:54;"No, no, no, dad, this is the dead."
25:54;25:55;"Oh, I don't like them."
25:55;25:57;"Love Neil Young, incredible artist."
25:57;26:00;"I wonder if Trump could name one Neil Young song."
26:00;26:01;"- Yeah."
26:01;26:01;"- Although as discussed--"
26:01;26:03;"- Heart of Gold, Old Man?"
26:03;26:04;"That'd be fascinating."
26:04;26:06;"- He just seems like such a weirdo."
26:06;26:08;"The idea that he could actually recall something like that."
26:08;26:10;"- Right, right, I know what you mean."
26:10;26:12;"- I'm not saying that he hasn't listened to Neil Young,"
26:12;26:14;"but the one interesting thing about him,"
26:14;26:16;"given that he's such a monster,"
26:16;26:18;"this has come up in a few discussions over the years."
26:18;26:21;"So obviously, everything the guy says,"
26:21;26:25;"horrible, just narcissistic garbage,"
26:25;26:29;"and then infamously, when Ali G was trying to punk him,"
26:29;26:31;"back on the old Ali G show,"
26:31;26:33;"he was doing a fake bit where he was trying to get Trump"
26:33;26:35;"to invest in his ice cream glove company."
26:35;26:37;"It's a glove to cover your hands when you eat ice cream."
26:37;26:39;"So he's pitching him, he goes,"
26:39;26:44;"yo, what is the one thing everyone in the world loves?"
26:44;26:46;"And Trump, quick, goes, music."
26:46;26:48;"And then Ali G goes, no, no, no, ice cream."
26:48;26:49;"And then whatever."
26:49;26:50;"But I was always kind of like--"
26:50;26:51;"- Wow."
26:51;26:52;"- You know what I mean?"
26:52;26:54;"- What did he even mind specifically?"
26:54;26:58;"- And also, just Trump being such a selfish dude,"
26:58;27:02;"it would seem off-brand for Trump to be like, music."
27:02;27:04;"It's just a kind vibe thing to say."
27:04;27:06;"Maybe he meant more from a market research point of view."
27:06;27:08;"- Yeah, you'd think he'd be like, diamonds."
27:08;27:09;"- Yeah."
27:09;27:11;"- Right. - Gold."
27:11;27:12;"- Real estate investments."
27:12;27:13;"The band KISS."
27:13;27:16;"(laughing)"
27:16;27:17;"- Well, thanks for hanging out with us today."
27:17;27:19;"It's been an interesting day."
27:19;27:23;"Seinfeld Diner, hanging around Columbia."
27:23;27:24;"Love just at the end of the day,"
27:24;27:26;"it's like we're just standing on the Columbia campus,"
27:26;27:30;"outdoors, just talking Trump and KISS."
27:30;27:31;"It's just kind of like, one way or another,"
27:31;27:34;"just wherever you are, you know."
27:34;27:35;"The more things change, the more they stay the same,"
27:35;27:37;"I guess is what I'm saying."
27:37;27:41;"Anyway, we're gonna wrap it up, go to a new neighborhood,"
27:41;27:43;"and we'll check back in tomorrow"
27:43;27:45;"when you guys will be on the ground"

34:30;34:31;"Do you wanna introduce?"
34:31;34:33;"- Hi, I'm Brandon Wardell."
34:33;34:34;"- Friend of the show."
34:34;34:35;"- Friend of the show, friend of the pod."
34:35;34:37;"Well it's not a pod."
34:37;34:38;"Friend of the--"
34:38;34:38;"- Internet radio program."
34:38;34:41;"- Friend of the internet radio program."
34:41;34:43;"- I'm Jaboukie Young-Wai."
34:43;34:46;"- Brendan O'Hare, O apostrophe H-A-R-E."
34:46;34:48;"- So what did you guys think of this first set?"
34:48;34:50;"Like just, you know, candid thoughts."
34:50;34:55;"You can criticize it as raw as you want here."
34:55;34:57;"- I thought it was a lovely set."
34:57;34:58;"I thought they really ripped it up."
34:58;35:00;"Music is just a wonderful thing."
35:00;35:03;"I love listening to it and I'm excited to hear"
35:03;35:05;"12 more hours of it today."
35:05;35:06;"- Yeah, I've heard all those songs before"
35:06;35:08;"and I wish that they had done songs"
35:08;35:09;"that I've never heard before."
35:09;35:10;"No, I'm kidding."
35:10;35:13;"I actually missed the set."
35:13;35:14;"- You've been actually, you've been kind of,"
35:14;35:16;"I've seen some spicy tweets from you"
35:16;35:19;"about like Seinfeld 2000 or Vampire Weekend."
35:19;35:20;"- I was like--"
35:20;35:21;"- I'm sorry, no, no, no."
35:21;35:22;"About the band, right?"
35:22;35:24;"Like some of the political ramifications"
35:24;35:28;"of like what it means to be a fan of this band in 2019."
35:28;35:30;"Can you like expand on that at all?"
35:30;35:33;"- The political ramifications of being a fan of this,"
35:33;35:37;"I mean, you know, listening to Vampire Weekend,"
35:37;35:40;"you do sort of go up in the social strata,"
35:40;35:43;"the more that you listen to it, right?"
35:43;35:45;"I actually have to pay more taxes this year"
35:45;35:49;"because I listened to Vampire Weekend too much in 2018."
35:49;35:52;"- Would you say it's a little bit revolutionary"
35:52;35:53;"to be a fan of this band?"
35:53;35:56;"- I would, I would, no, I would say it's revolutionary"
35:56;36:01;"to be a fan of this band and to not be a fan of this band."
36:01;36:03;"For me, at this point, I feel like I would kind of"
36:03;36:07;"be a class traitor to not be a fan of Vampire Weekend."
36:08;36:10;"- So, you got your own podcast happening."
36:10;36:13;"Has it started already or?"
36:13;36:15;"- It's going to start this Wednesday."
36:15;36:18;"This is Branchburg with me and Corey Snorowski."
36:18;36:20;"Tim Heidecker is producing it."
36:20;36:22;"He's a friend of the show, Tim Heidecker,"
36:22;36:24;"so yeah, I think it'll be a good time"
36:24;36:26;"if you listen in, Apple Podcasts."
36:26;36:27;"- What's it all about?"
36:27;36:32;"- So it is about a group of characters, monologues,"
36:32;36:34;"sketches, all that type of thing,"
36:34;36:37;"located in a small town called Branchburg, New Jersey."
36:37;36:39;"It's all pre-scripted."
36:39;36:41;"Episodes are about 15 minutes long every Wednesday,"
36:41;36:43;"so it's quick."
36:43;36:45;"If you want a nice commute little thing to listen to,"
36:45;36:47;"you want to listen to something at dinner,"
36:47;36:48;"it's the perfect thing."
36:48;36:50;"- Is it made for dinner?"
36:50;36:51;"- It's made for dinner."
36:51;36:53;"Lunch, no, dinner, yes."
36:53;36:55;"- Is it a podcast or a suppertime?"
36:55;36:58;"This band loves suppertime podcasts."

43:14;43:15;"What's up?"
43:15;43:20;"The Crisis crew and Billions creator, Brian Koppelman."
43:20;43:22;"I'm so thrilled to be here, but on Time Crisis,"
43:22;43:24;"a co-creator along with Dave Levine,"
43:24;43:27;"but on Time Crisis, I have to say Anna Koppelman's dad,"
43:27;43:30;"because she is your most dedicated and loyal listener."
43:30;43:32;"You've read her letter on the air,"
43:32;43:34;"so I have to shout out to Anna,"
43:34;43:36;"and I'm not going to tell her that I did this,"
43:36;43:38;"so she's just going to-- you're hearing it now."
43:38;43:40;"Sorry, boo, that I didn't tell you before."
43:40;43:42;"Do you guys listen to the show together,"
43:42;43:44;"or is it like a family bonding experience?"
43:44;43:47;"Anna and Sam, her brother, her older brother, my son,"
43:47;43:49;"they listen really religiously."
43:49;43:52;"Even Anna's at college and Sam's out of college,"
43:52;43:54;"they'll call each other during the show."
43:54;43:58;"They're way into it, and I listen when I'm sort of permitted to"
43:58;44:00;"or I'm part of it somehow."
44:00;44:02;"What did you think of set one?"
44:02;44:05;"I'm a huge vampire-- I mean, I love Vampire Weekend."
44:05;44:06;"I love the set."
44:06;44:08;"First of all, the cover songs,"
44:08;44:10;"it was like they were playing them for me."
44:10;44:13;"Joker Man is one of my all-time favorite Dylan songs."
44:13;44:16;"It's what got me, and if you've watched the show,"
44:16;44:18;"you know that we use a Dylan song,"
44:18;44:20;"and I know you guys watch the show."
44:20;44:22;"We use a Dylan song every season."
44:22;44:24;"He's the one artist that no matter what we use"
44:24;44:26;"to close out an episode."
44:26;44:28;"This year we used World Gone Wrong."
44:28;44:31;"But Infidels is one of-- it's basically the Dylan album"
44:31;44:33;"that I listened to first to get into Dylan"
44:33;44:35;"when I was a freshman in college,"
44:35;44:37;"and then I went backwards from there."
44:37;44:41;"And hearing it played as a close-out to the last--"
44:41;44:43;"to the first set, the last song,"
44:43;44:45;"was really amazing to me."
44:45;44:49;"How tough is it to get a Dylan song for a TV show?"
44:49;44:51;"Like, how does that even work?"
44:51;44:53;"Not that hard, depending--"
44:53;44:56;"I used some songs of Bob's in movies,"
44:56;44:59;"and I think after the first season,"
44:59;45:02;"when people understood the way we used music,"
45:02;45:05;"artists seemed pretty willing to give us their music."
45:05;45:08;"I mean, as you guys know, you make a deal,"
45:08;45:11;"but this year we got a Springsteen song in the show,"
45:11;45:14;"and I really wasn't sure, 'cause Bruce rarely does it,"
45:14;45:16;"and we heard that he'd read the script pages"
45:16;45:18;"on vacation somewhere and then wrote back,"
45:18;45:20;"""Yeah, we could do it."""
45:20;45:22;"I had a good feeling we'd be able to do it."
45:22;45:26;"Once we got Bob in the first season, then..."
45:26;45:29;"Bruce was like, ""Okay, Bob did it."""
45:29;45:32;"Yeah, once you get Bob, you sort of then"
45:32;45:35;"start explaining the way you're gonna start using music."
45:35;45:37;"Was that Atlantic City?"
45:37;45:39;"Yeah, 'cause I remember one of the characters comes in,"
45:39;45:42;"and he's like, ""Well, we blew up the Chicken Man"
45:42;45:44;"in Philly last night."""
45:44;45:47;"I feel like you really loosened up on this season"
45:47;45:51;"with, like, really going all in with fun musical references."
45:51;45:53;"Like, there was this scene when Giamatti's, like,"
45:53;45:57;"quoting Jerry Rafferty lyrics, and he's like, ""Doobies?"""
45:57;46:00;"I was like, ""Talk about-- like, is this made for me?"""
46:00;46:02;"What is the Venn diagram between your musical taste"
46:02;46:04;"and Bobby Axelrod's musical tastes?"
46:04;46:06;"'Cause he seems like a metalhead, but..."
46:06;46:08;"Yeah, I mean, Axe loves Metallica."
46:08;46:10;"When I was 21, I was on the road with Metallica."
46:10;46:12;"-Really? -I was their A&R guy."
46:12;46:14;"I didn't sign them, but I was their A&R guy."
46:14;46:16;"-Speed of sound tour. -When the guy who signed them left."
46:16;46:19;"It was the ""Justice for All"" tour."
46:19;46:21;"-Oh, okay. Bunch of ass[bleep] -And, um..."
46:21;46:24;"I was on the road for the tour a bit."
46:24;46:28;"And, um, the reason we have Axe be a metal fan"
46:28;46:30;"is a few different reasons."
46:30;46:33;"One, when he was a kid, he would have liked"
46:33;46:35;"the sort of full-on ethos of metal,"
46:35;46:37;"and he wouldn't have had that much time"
46:37;46:39;"for the politics of punk."
46:39;46:42;"Like, the politics of punk rock, the anarchy in that way,"
46:42;46:44;"wouldn't have really been where he was at."
46:44;46:47;"Later, he would have maybe understood all that or cared about it."
46:47;46:49;"And we also liked it as a bonding thing for Axe and his friends,"
46:49;46:51;"and we'd heard a story about a guy like Axe"
46:51;46:55;"who brought all of his friends to see a Pearl Jam in real life."
46:55;46:59;"He brought them to, like, some Austin festival,"
46:59;47:01;"and they choppered right backstage."
47:01;47:03;"-Oh, my God. -And so we, early on,"
47:03;47:05;"had this notion that Axe would do it,"
47:05;47:07;"but for him, we felt it would be Metallica."
47:07;47:10;"I love all that music. I'm totally down with that music."
47:10;47:14;"I think I probably have a broader musical palette than Axe."
47:14;47:17;"-Right. -Dave and I -- Dave is my co-creator,"
47:17;47:18;"parts of the show. -Yeah."
47:18;47:21;"-The two of us love all sorts of music,"
47:21;47:24;"and our taste is sort of in all the characters."
47:24;47:26;"-Right. -So when Giamatti's talking"
47:26;47:29;"about the Bell album, Al Green's Bell album,"
47:29;47:31;"that comes from stuff we were thinking about,"
47:31;47:32;"about the Bell album."
47:32;47:35;"And then we try to apply it to the ways"
47:35;47:37;"in which the characters think about the world."
47:37;47:41;"You know, last week, Taylor quoted the ""Turtles"" song ""Happy Together,"""
47:41;47:43;"and that was a shout-out to my dad, who --"
47:43;47:45;"he was a music publisher, and that was, like,"
47:45;47:48;"the first cut that he ever got was ""Happy Together."""
47:48;47:50;"So we're always using music in various ways."
47:50;47:54;"-It's such a cool way to, like, flush out a character's inner life."
47:54;47:57;"'Cause, like, we all have these relationships with music,"
47:57;48:00;"and it's rare to see characters like that on a TV or movie."
48:00;48:02;"So, like, really, like, you get --"
48:02;48:04;"Well, actually, here's another question."
48:04;48:08;"I've noticed this -- very, very subtle Lebowski references"
48:08;48:09;"on the show."
48:09;48:13;"Now, do WAGs and Axe, like, do they share a love"
48:13;48:15;"for Lebowski in the fictional universe?"
48:15;48:17;"'Cause there's that one scene when, like, the detective --"
48:17;48:20;"or, like, his weird, like, handler guy is sort of like,"
48:20;48:21;"""He's a good man,"" and Thoreau."
48:21;48:25;"And then WAGs and Axe share a look, and I'm like,"
48:25;48:26;"""This is so subtle."""
48:26;48:29;"Like, that's for, like, 5% of the audience, if that."
48:29;48:32;"-Yes, well, I think a good man -- he's a good man, Jeffrey,"
48:32;48:35;"but Thoreau is something that people would note."
48:35;48:37;"Like, many people love Lebowski."
48:37;48:39;"But, yes, it's a small -- I agree with you."
48:39;48:40;"It's a small cohort of us."
48:40;48:42;"-Maybe, like, 20%. -Yeah, it's a small percentage."
48:42;48:43;"You know, we're throwing stuff, like,"
48:43;48:44;"""So you're catching Lebowski."
48:44;48:47;"Someone else is catching Goodfellas."
48:47;48:48;"Someone else is noticing"
48:48;48:50;"a different reference that we put out there."""
48:50;48:53;"And so, for us, these characters --"
48:53;48:55;"that's the lingua franca of the world."
48:55;48:56;"They talk that way."
48:56;49:00;"They talk to each other in terms of these cultural references."
49:00;49:03;"And many sort of smart, culturally literate people"
49:03;49:04;"are in that world."
49:04;49:07;"And for us, also, it just adds to the fun"
49:07;49:09;"and adds to the Easter eggs."
49:09;49:10;"For the obsessive audience,"
49:10;49:13;"people watch our show two, three, four times each episode."
49:13;49:14;"-Wow. Yeah. -And so I'll see --"
49:14;49:16;"And there are people who have compendiums"
49:16;49:17;"of all the references."
49:17;49:20;"And for us, it just adds layers and dimensions"
49:20;49:21;"to these characters."
49:21;49:23;"Like, that moment, that was scripted."
49:23;49:24;"So these actors are amazing."
49:24;49:25;"So it was scripted that those guys"
49:25;49:26;"look at each other on the spot."
49:26;49:27;"Because, yeah, they get --"
49:27;49:28;"They're looking at each other like,"
49:28;49:30;"""Did Hall just intentionally do that?"
49:30;49:31;"Or did he just do that?"""
49:31;49:33;"And so that's what the two guys are looking at each other as."
49:33;49:34;"-Right, that's what I love. -Just to say."
49:34;49:37;"And then, yes, for you, who's hip to Lebowski,"
49:37;49:40;"it's just another reason for you to be into the show, you know?"
49:40;49:41;"Well, it's true."
49:41;49:42;"And it's like, that's the way --"
49:42;49:43;"Like, I'm not a hedge-fund guy,"
49:43;49:44;"but that's the way I talk to my friends."
49:44;49:47;"We talk about rock lyrics and movie quotes."
49:47;49:48;"It's like, that's --"
49:48;49:50;"That's like 90% of the conversations"
49:50;49:51;"I have with my friends."
49:51;49:52;"Us, too."
49:52;49:53;"You know, that's the way that David and I --"
49:53;49:55;"Look, David's my lifelong best friend."
49:55;49:57;"So the two of us, that's the conversation"
49:57;50:00;"we've been having since we were 14 and 15."
50:00;50:01;"I'm [bleep] 53 years old now."
50:01;50:04;"So this is a conversation that's been going on forever."
50:04;50:06;"Brian, I'm sorry. I'd be --"
50:06;50:07;"I just got to ask you --"
50:07;50:09;"This is a complete shifting of gears,"
50:09;50:13;"but as a prolific television writer, film writer,"
50:13;50:15;"the TV show ""Seinfeld,"""
50:15;50:17;"what do you think it would be like"
50:17;50:19;"if it was still on television today?"
50:19;50:20;"What would those characters be up to?"
50:20;50:21;"If you were involved, even,"
50:21;50:23;"where would you steer those characters?"
50:23;50:27;"I mean, they would still be talking about nothing, right?"
50:27;50:29;"By the way, I'm so thrilled to be here."
50:29;50:30;"Thank you guys for having me here."
50:30;50:32;"It's really scoring points for my kids."
50:32;50:34;"But also, I'm just thrilled to be here."
50:34;50:36;"And as I say, this is a perfect day."
50:36;50:37;"What an incredible day."

01:00:18;01:00:23;"I listen to a lot of NBA satellite radio talk."

01:00:41;01:00:47;"After all the support he showed them when they played Barclays Center"
01:00:47;01:00:51;"with his-- he had jersey after jersey that he--"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"- Oh, from, like, old Nets players? - Yeah, yeah."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"- Did you go to that show? - I think I was at that show, right?"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"I saw that ""Radio City"" was the second album,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"and then ""Barclay"" was the third album, right?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Does that sound about right?"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"Have you been on board with a vampire from the beginning?"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"Yeah, I guess, you know, into the first album."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"I was not from the very beginning, but I felt bad."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"I kind of teased them on the best show, and I felt super guilty"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"because I was only making fun of their clothes."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And then I admitted-- I went up to SNL one time,"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"and I saw them in the hall, and everybody was so nice to me."
01:01:28;01:01:32;"And I was just like, ""I just have to say I made fun of your clothes on the radio"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"just so I wouldn't be, like, some two-faced creep."""
01:01:34;01:01:38;"Because I was just like, ""I don't know why I'm talking about this right now."""
01:01:38;01:01:40;"But I said it-- I admitted it."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I'm not going to be two-faced with stuff."
01:01:43;01:01:49;"I said, ""I said that you dress like the preppy killer Robert Chambers."""
01:01:49;01:01:51;"And they're like, ""Oh, we know."""
01:01:51;01:01:53;"It was like, ""Okay."" I was like, ""Great."""
01:01:53;01:01:57;"I said, ""I love the music."" And they're like, ""Okay, that's all that matters."""
01:01:57;01:02:01;"And then the friendship to last the ages was born"
01:02:01;01:02:06;"on my sneaky talking out of the side of my mouth"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"and being a complete coward."
01:02:08;01:02:14;"Yes, so-- and here I find myself in the VIP section of a show."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"-12 years later. -12 years later, yes."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"And it's, like, very lavish here, by the way, just to set the scene."
01:02:20;01:02:24;"It's, like, opulent. There's a lot of gilded gold and stuff."
01:02:24;01:02:30;"Yeah, Tom, you know, I heard you speak about the Twitter account Seinfeld today"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"on The Best Show as well, and I just want to clarify"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"that that's not the account that I run."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"-No, no, I know that. -Don't worry."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"Okay, I just wanted to make sure, 'cause a lot of people think it's the same."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"And you were very savage, but I just want to say that my approach was"
01:02:45;01:02:49;"I had the same feeling as you, which is why I started the whole thing."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"On a separate note, and I don't want to put you on the spot,"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"has anyone ever told you that you look like Chris Noth a little bit"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"from Law & Order?"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"-Nicer than what people usually say. -That's a good call, dude."
01:02:59;01:03:03;"Like, you could be, like, his brother, I feel, like his comedic brother in a film."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"-What do you usually-- -They usually think I just look like"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"some kind of, like, janitor or something."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"Like, they usually just ask me, like, ""How can I get into this room?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Do you have keys for this room?"""
01:03:15;01:03:17;"[laughter]"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"Just like, ""I don't work here."""
01:03:19;01:03:21;"It's probably 'cause I dress in blue all the time,"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"and I just have a give-off, a kind of janitor vibe."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"-Yeah. -That's pretty good."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"-Mr. Big. -I'll take it, right?"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"-Right. -Thank you."
01:03:30;01:03:34;"What are his three-- It's Law & Order, Mr. Big, is that it?"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"He's, like, on The Good Wife, is that a thing?"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"-One of the good shows. -One of the goods."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Claire, what do you look to these days?"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"You know, just hanging loose."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"What?"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"Fast and the news."
01:03:47;01:03:51;"I do want to tell-- Can I tell Mike's CT Chris talk stories?"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"-He's-- -This is a good one."
01:03:53;01:03:57;"Where when he was on The Best Show, I was with my boyfriend at the time"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"who was also-- came to visit the studio,"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"and Chris offered us a ride home back to Brooklyn,"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"which was very nice, from New Jersey."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"-Wow. The nicest thing. -Long distance."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Long distance."
01:04:09;01:04:15;"And my boyfriend somehow managed to get drunk off of beer"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"in the-- however long the show was,"
01:04:18;01:04:23;"and was feeling way too comfortable in Chris's van,"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"and said something to the effect of, like--"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"He was a bartender, and he goes,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"""Whenever someone puts your guys' music on,"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"I'm always like, 'Turn this s--t off!'"""
01:04:33;01:04:34;"Wow."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"""But you're really cool. Thanks so much for the ride."""
01:04:37;01:04:42;"So that's my connection to Vampire Weekend."
01:04:42;01:04:46;"I feel like Vampire Weekend is a band that encourages that kind of openness."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"-I think so, too. -Yeah."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And it just speaks to their connection to their audience."
01:04:50;01:04:55;"That your boyfriend would feel comfortable even saying that to them."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Whereas he may not say that to Kings of Leon."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"Exactly."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"Or Imagine Dragons."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"No disrespect to Imagine Dragons,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"because they do some great work."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"Thanks so much for hopping on the mic for a second."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Oh, no. Thanks for having us."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"Really an honor to meet you guys."

01:08:18;01:08:20;"How long?"
01:08:23;01:08:35;"Okay, backstage here in between sets two and three. How long was, okay, before I should introduce, I'm here with Brian Jones, the lead guitarist, is that fair to say?"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"It rotates, but yeah, sure."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"I feel like you're the lead guitarist of Vampire Weekend."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"I'll defer to Ezra on that one."
01:08:42;01:08:53;"I was just commenting to you on your playing, and the song Sunflower especially really goes off. You guys took it to almost like a proggy level."
01:08:53;01:09:00;"We added a lot to it. We have, and that's one of like three kind of ways we do that song."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"Oh really?"
01:09:01;01:09:08;"We've done it like 15 different ways, but we've only played live I think two of the different iterations of it."
01:09:08;01:09:14;"We have another jam that's even deadier than the one that we did tonight."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Right."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"The one that we did tonight is kind of like Sabbath-y inspired."
01:09:18;01:09:22;"Yeah, it was like, it started kind of dead, kind of firing them out, and then it got heavy."
01:09:22;01:09:30;"Right, exactly. It goes like pretty prog rocky for sure, but there's another one that's like pretty just like, I don't know when we're going to do it, but you'll hear it."
01:09:30;01:09:37;"So how, like, so then before the set were you like, we're doing the Sabbath version tonight. How does it work?"
01:09:37;01:09:42;"We originally planned to not do the Sabbath version, and we were, because you know, there's only so much time in the set."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Yeah."
01:09:43;01:09:49;"But we, someone, Ezra called an audible on the spot and was like, yo, why aren't we doing the jam version of it?"
01:09:49;01:09:55;"So, I mean, needless to say I was very excited when that audible was called."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Wait, so does that mean like into the in-ear?"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Or what does that mean, audibles called?"
01:09:59;01:10:04;"We have a little bit of a closed circuit system. On the set list, we have different names for all the jams."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Right, like code names."
01:10:06;01:10:10;"And yeah, it was just Sunflower. We call them other things. We're not going to say exactly what they were."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"Okay."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"But we call them other things. The one we played tonight was Stoneflower."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Uh-huh."
01:10:15;01:10:19;"But it was Sunflower on the set list. It just, you know."
01:10:19;01:10:22;"And then just kind of impromptu in the moment, you guys went to the Sabbath version."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"Yeah, it's like, we should do Stoneflower. And then we did it. It was great."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"That was kind of mind-blowing, I have to say."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"That's a really fun one to do. I love playing that."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"So how does that, like in the rehearsals, how did that take form?"
01:10:34;01:10:39;"Was it sort of like, like the first time you played Sunflower with the band, was he like,"
01:10:39;01:10:43;"""Let's play the song and then just see what happens?"" Or like, how does that develop to that?"
01:10:43;01:10:47;"I'd say there were probably like three or four times. We had a lot of time to just rehearse."
01:10:47;01:10:50;"Because, you know, just like, that's how the schedule worked out."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"And we just had a lot of time to mess around and experiment."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Yeah."
01:10:53;01:10:59;"I'd say we jammed on that probably five different times before we ever solidified anything."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"So we just came up with ideas and then."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Yeah."
01:11:02;01:11:08;"That's the first kind of like solidified, like, we should do that live jam that we came up with."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"Right."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"And then there's a couple other ones."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"I'm psyched to see them throughout the rest of the day and the year."
01:11:14;01:11:19;"So anyway, thanks Brian for jumping on the mic here for a sec."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"My absolute pleasure."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Awesome."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"One, two, three."
01:11:31;01:11:41;"Sunflower in the morning, standing in the garden, all before you wait."
01:11:41;01:11:46;"No power can compel you out into the daylight."
01:11:46;01:11:51;"Let that evil way."
01:11:51;01:11:55;"Strange start upon the pillar."
01:11:55;01:11:59;"What day commands the day?"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"Well, I don't know."
01:12:19;01:12:29;"Sunflower in the evening, standing in the garden, taking up that space."
01:12:29;01:12:34;"No power can compel me back into the daylight."
01:12:34;01:12:38;"Let that evil way."
01:12:38;01:12:43;"Strange start upon the pillar."
01:12:43;01:12:47;"What day commands the day?"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"Well, I don't know."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kainey."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"Beats one."
01:13:21;01:13:27;"[Applause]"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"So we're right in the middle of the kind of Steve Lacey suite of the album."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Steve's on tour with the internet."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"We love you, Steve."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"We're going to play together soon."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"But luckily we still know how to play it, so it's all good."
01:13:47;01:13:57;"If the sun don't make things right, then it's going to take a year."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"Going to take a year."
01:14:00;01:14:09;"Flower moon, sacred sun, Coca-Cola and red wine."
01:14:09;01:14:15;"Now's the time to disappear."
01:14:15;01:14:19;"Going to take a year."
01:14:29;01:14:39;"[Applause]"
