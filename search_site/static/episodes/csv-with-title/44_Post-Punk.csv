00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles."
00:04;00:10;"I reconnect with Jake as we talk about Bernie Madoff and the Grateful Dead."
00:10;00:16;"We also answer listener emails and educate ourselves about the origins of 5-hour energy drink."
00:16;00:24;"All this, plus we count down the top 5 hits of 1967 and 2017."
00:24;00:26;"This is..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:34;"Beats 1."
01:16;01:18;"Time Crisis, back in LA."
01:18;01:21;"Here with my LA co-host, Jake Longstrap."
01:21;01:23;"What's up, dude?"
01:23;01:24;"Not much, man."
01:24;01:28;"Jake, you just asked me an interesting question before the mics got turned on."
01:28;01:31;"Uh, have you done 5-hour energy drinks?"
01:31;01:33;"Tried or done?"
01:33;01:38;"Well, you phrased it as ""have you done,"" which makes it sound like heroin."
01:38;01:40;"Have you done 5-hour energy?"
01:40;01:43;"Have you ever done A&W cream soda?"
01:43;01:45;"Oh yeah."
01:45;01:50;"5-hour energy was kind of--it doesn't really feel like a beverage."
01:50;01:51;"Yeah."
01:51;01:54;"Like, Red Bull feels like an energy drink."
01:54;01:58;"5-hour energy feels like a mild drug."
01:58;02:00;"Yeah, like a shot of something."
02:00;02:03;"Right, because it's packaged in that funky little thing."
02:03;02:10;"I think I took one down once, but I've probably--you know, in my life, I've probably had like 43 Red Bulls."
02:10;02:12;"That's a fair amount."
02:12;02:15;"A thousand servings of Coke, easily."
02:15;02:16;"Coca-Cola."
02:16;02:17;"Oh yeah."
02:17;02:19;"More than that, man."
02:19;02:23;"Pepsi, a.k.a. Brad's drink, maybe like 11 times."
02:23;02:24;"No, no, hold on."
02:24;02:25;"Let's back up."
02:25;02:30;"On the Coca-Cola, when you were a kid, how many Cokes were you drinking?"
02:30;02:32;"There was none in the household."
02:32;02:33;"Okay."
02:33;02:39;"So at home--so I probably didn't actually sip on a Coke until I was like 7 or 8 years old over at somebody else's house."
02:39;02:40;"Right."
02:40;02:41;"And then, yeah."
02:41;02:43;"Okay, so teen years, you're going pretty light."
02:43;02:46;"You're going like maybe, what, 20 Cokes a year?"
02:46;02:47;"It's hard to say."
02:47;02:48;"50?"
02:48;02:50;"Like one a week when you're a teenager, like in high school?"
02:50;02:54;"Like you guys were like stopping by the deli, you get a Coke?"
02:54;02:59;"No, because when we would go to the deli, I would always get a peach Snapple."
02:59;03:01;"Oh, dude, Snapple."
03:01;03:04;"I was super into Snapple when I was in high school."
03:04;03:06;"They advertise on the Yankee games."
03:06;03:08;"Made from the best stuff on earth."
03:08;03:11;"Remember that Snapple was branded as like a New York beverage?"
03:11;03:12;"Totally."
03:12;03:15;"Because there was that lady, Wendy, who was like a real New Yorker."
03:15;03:17;"Yeah, I was so into Snapple."
03:17;03:18;"You know what's crazy?"
03:18;03:26;"Okay, 770 AM, WABC in New York had the Yankee games on, and they would advertise Snapple continuously."
03:26;03:30;"And they would advertise for a new radio show hosted by a guy named Rush Limbaugh."
03:30;03:31;"Wow."
03:31;03:37;"I remember just like fourth inning break, be like, ""WABC New York, Rush Limbaugh!"""
03:37;03:42;"And I would just be like, I remember that name was just in my consciousness when I was like 11."
03:42;03:44;"I'm just like, ""Who is Rush Limbaugh?"""
03:44;03:46;"Limbaugh. Such a funny name."
03:46;03:48;"Anyway, back to Snapple."
03:48;03:50;"Oh, no, back to your..."
03:50;03:52;"Okay, let's dial it all the way back."
03:52;03:55;"Annual Coke consumption circa 1998."
03:55;03:57;"Lifetime count."
03:57;03:58;"Servings."
03:58;04:01;"And occasionally you don't finish the can, obviously, but we're counting that."
04:01;04:05;"We're counting Diet Coke, Cherry Coke."
04:05;04:09;"Maybe a thousand isn't a bad guess."
04:09;04:11;"A lot of movie theater Cokes."
04:11;04:16;"Have you ever bought like a six pack of soda just to keep at home?"
04:16;04:18;"I mean, when I was younger, for sure."
04:18;04:20;"I used to buy 24 packs of Mountain Dew."
04:20;04:22;"Oh, why?"
04:22;04:24;"When I was in college, man."
04:24;04:25;"That was your fuel?"
04:25;04:31;"Me and my friend Jason Anderson would take the bus from our college campus in Portland to the Fred Meyer,"
04:31;04:35;"which is like the Vons of the Pacific Northwest."
04:35;04:37;"We'd each buy a cube."
04:37;04:39;"A cube meaning a 24 pack of..."
04:39;04:41;"Yeah, a cube. Mountain Dew cube."
04:41;04:45;"Circa 1996 and then get back on the bus with room temperature cubes."
04:45;04:46;"Yeah."
04:46;04:52;"And then we each had these mini fridges in our dorm rooms and we'd fill each fridge with Mountain Dews."
04:52;04:56;"And then reconvene in a few hours and just hang out and play guitar and drink Mountain Dew."
04:56;04:57;"It's really making me nostalgic."
04:57;05:02;"Not exactly a Chick magnet scene."
05:02;05:06;"These are the kind of experiences that kids today are missing out on."
05:06;05:08;"We would drink Mountain Dew like it was beer."
05:08;05:10;"We would slam like four Mountain Dews."
05:10;05:12;"Oh, you wouldn't get like a stomachache?"
05:12;05:13;"Probably. Yeah, kind of."
05:13;05:16;"You're 18. You're just like, ""What?"" It just goes right through you."

06:19;06:23;"Five Hour Energy has always been such a creepy brand to me."
06:23;06:26;"'Cause Five Hour Energy, it's like, you know,"
06:26;06:29;"like when you go to sometimes like a bodega or a truck stop"
06:29;06:33;"and they sell kind of like weird, like, sex drugs?"
06:33;06:35;"Right. Like, yeah, like in the bathroom."
06:35;06:38;"Yeah, or sometimes like right at the counter,"
06:38;06:41;"just like, trucker Viagra or something."
06:41;06:43;"And it's called like, sometimes it's like,"
06:43;06:47;"has this like faux Asian aesthetic, like tiger style."
06:47;06:50;"Okay. Take two of these and I don't know."
06:50;06:51;"Five Hour Energy just reminds me of that."
06:51;06:54;"Yeah, no, for sure. And yet it's like a massive thing."
06:54;06:55;"I wonder who owns Five Hour Energy."
06:55;06:57;"I think, well, we should look into that."
06:57;06:59;"I think it's like the amount that it's served in."
06:59;07:01;"It's like three ounces."
07:01;07:03;"That to me is like the weird part."
07:03;07:06;"So it's like condensed. It's almost like a syrup."
07:06;07:10;"Like if someone drank Red Bull in concentrate form."
07:10;07:12;"Okay, so Five Hour Energy."
07:12;07:13;"Wait, wait, hold on."
07:13;07:16;"Let me guess the year that it was introduced to the market."
07:16;07:17;"So Jake, what's your guess?"
07:17;07:18;"I'm going to say '02."
07:18;07:20;"That's a great guess."
07:20;07:21;"Thank you."
07:21;07:23;"It actually launched in 2003."
07:23;07:25;"Okay, I'm glad we looked this up."
07:25;07:30;"Cause you know, sometimes the feel good immigrant story,"
07:30;07:31;"I've mixed feelings about it."
07:31;07:33;"Cause I always love,"
07:33;07:36;"because we're all descended from immigrants."
07:36;07:40;"I always love to hear about an immigrant coming to America and making it big."
07:40;07:44;"Which we've discussed on this show many times."
07:44;07:46;"Right, because that's always this go-to thing."
07:46;07:49;"Like we talked about that, the Budweiser commercial."
07:49;07:50;"Right."
07:50;07:52;"That kind of dramatized a guy coming from Germany."
07:52;07:53;"Richard Montanez."
07:53;07:56;"Right. The janitor who created Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
07:56;07:58;"I love an immigrant who makes good."
07:58;08:02;"Now that said, this is kind of like the crisis of liberalism is like,"
08:02;08:05;"you know, got to have open borders."
08:05;08:06;"I believe in that."
08:06;08:08;"But at the same time,"
08:08;08:12;"often the stories that we celebrate of immigrants who came and made it in America,"
08:12;08:15;"it's never like this person left a war-torn place,"
08:15;08:20;"and now they help in America their child start working at the UN"
08:20;08:22;"to make sure that people don't suffer."
08:22;08:24;"The stories we always celebrate are like,"
08:24;08:26;"they came from poverty in another country."
08:26;08:29;"Not even necessarily poverty, but somebody came from another country."
08:29;08:32;"And this has been true forever, going back hundreds of years."
08:32;08:36;"It's like America is a place where you can come and make your dreams come true."
08:36;08:39;"And the dream that they always talk about is not like making the world a better place."
08:39;08:44;"It's always like making cold hard cash, building a brand."
08:44;08:50;"So anyway, I'm very happy to see that 5-Hour Energy Drink"
08:50;08:53;"is produced by Innovation Ventures, LLC."
08:53;08:54;"Great name."
08:54;08:57;"Which is a great name, Innovation Ventures."
08:57;09:01;"And the CEO is named Manoj Bhargava."
09:01;09:04;"He was born in Lucknow in India in 1953."
09:04;09:10;"And then at the age of 14, 1967, moved with his family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
09:10;09:12;"So kind of opposite of Fresh Prince."
09:12;09:15;"And while he moved there, his dad went to the Wharton School of Business."
09:15;09:16;"Sick."
09:16;09:18;"At University of Pennsylvania."
09:18;09:19;"With?"
09:19;09:21;"With Donald Trump, probably."
09:21;09:22;"Actually, that might have been the same time."
09:22;09:24;"Yeah, I think Trump was like late 60s."
09:24;09:27;"Trump was 70, so he probably graduated college in like 70."
09:27;09:31;"That was this guy's dad, but then he won a math scholarship"
09:31;09:33;"to an elite private academy called the Hill School."
09:33;09:36;"And after he graduated, he went to Princeton."
09:36;09:38;"That's a cool story."
09:38;09:40;"Yeah, coming generation."
09:40;09:41;"That's what you want to hear."
09:41;09:42;"Yeah, that's quick."
09:42;09:43;"That's quick."
09:43;09:46;"And then anyway, so then he starts Innovation Ventures, LLC,"
09:46;09:49;"and he launches 5-Hour Energy in 2003."
09:49;09:53;"So he was like 50 at that point."
09:53;09:54;"He was born in '53?"
09:54;09:55;"Yeah, he was 50."
09:55;09:56;"Interesting."
09:56;09:59;"And then in less than 10 years,"
09:59;10:05;"5-Hour Energy had grown to an estimated $1 billion market cap."
10:05;10:06;"Wow."
10:06;10:08;"Now this guy's a billionaire."
10:08;10:10;"A 5-Hour Energy."
10:10;10:12;"Here's what's cool about him."
10:12;10:17;"In 2015, he pledged to give 99% of his wealth to philanthropic causes."
10:17;10:18;"Dope."
10:18;10:20;"Shout out to you, Manoj Bhargava."

13:08;13:09;"(rap music)"
13:09;13:11;"- Time Crisis."
13:11;13:13;"- On Beat One."
13:13;13:15;"- It's maybe not a big surprise"
13:15;13:17;"that Manoj Bhargava is giving away so much of his wealth"
13:17;13:20;"because a lot of people don't know this about him."
13:20;13:21;"He's a practicing Buddhist."
13:21;13:23;"He's a Buddhist monk."
13:23;13:24;"- Wow."
13:24;13:26;"Did not see that coming."
13:26;13:30;"- So he initially wanted to call Five Hour Energy Drink"
13:30;13:32;"a focus drink."
13:32;13:36;"When you think of Red Bull, Red Bull gives you wings."
13:36;13:38;"So what, what are you gonna do with those wings?"
13:38;13:39;"You can go skateboarding?"
13:39;13:41;"- You're gonna add some vodka to that and--"
13:41;13:44;"- You're gonna add some vodka and like pump your fist"
13:44;13:46;"and be rowdy on the dance floor?"
13:46;13:47;"- At the EDM show."
13:47;13:50;"- At the EDM concert?"
13:50;13:50;"- EDM show."
13:50;13:54;"Hey, I'm going out to the EDM club."
13:54;13:57;"- Red Bull makes people more aggressive at clubs."
13:57;13:59;"Not like before where it was just cocaine."
13:59;14:01;"- Well, it's called Red Bull."
14:01;14:03;"- It's macho, it's angry."
14:03;14:05;"So anyway, he wasn't interested in that energy side."
14:05;14:07;"He wanted to call it a focus drink."
14:07;14:10;"I wonder if that has something to do with his"
14:10;14:11;"being a Buddhist monk."
14:11;14:13;"- Probably."
14:13;14:14;"So the FDA was like--"
14:14;14:16;"- But the FDA said, no, you can't call it a focus drink."
14:16;14:19;"- Oh, that's, they're being too vibe controlling."
14:19;14:21;"- Also just imagine if it was called Five Hour Focus."
14:21;14:22;"It'd be cool."
14:22;14:22;"- Yeah."
14:22;14:24;"- And actually he--"
14:24;14:25;"- God, that's such a better name."
14:25;14:26;"I feel bad for the guy now."
14:26;14:29;"- The more I read about this guy--"
14:29;14:31;"- He's like shoehorned into making this--"
14:31;14:34;"- The more I read about this guy, the more I like him."
14:34;14:36;"So even though this guy's a billionaire--"
14:36;14:38;"- Think about this, a Buddhist capitalist vibe."
14:38;14:40;"Let's, anyway."
14:40;14:41;"- Okay, yeah, there might--"
14:41;14:42;"- No, that's interesting."
14:42;14:43;"That's an interesting--"
14:43;14:43;"- Yeah, no, no."
14:43;14:48;"- Very contemporary fusion of contradictory ethos."
14:48;14:50;"Buddhist capitalist."
14:50;14:52;"Like, are there other Buddhist capitalists?"
14:52;14:53;"- It's seemingly contradictory."
14:53;14:56;"- Like Moby?"
14:56;14:58;"Is Moby a Buddhist capitalist?"
14:58;15:00;"- I mean, I feel like a lot of the Silicon Valley guys,"
15:00;15:02;"yo, Steve, Steve Jobs."
15:02;15:03;"- Oh yeah, dude."
15:03;15:04;"- He was always on some,"
15:04;15:06;"I don't know if he identified it as a Buddhist,"
15:06;15:11;"but anyway, Bhargava still spends one hour a day"
15:11;15:14;"in his basement practicing silent meditation."
15:14;15:17;"So like imagine how busy this billionaire guy"
15:17;15:19;"running innovation ventures,"
15:19;15:21;"he's under so much pressure to innovate,"
15:21;15:23;"but he still takes that one hour."
15:23;15:24;"'Cause a lot of these Silicon Valley guys,"
15:24;15:25;"they're taking 10 minutes"
15:25;15:26;"and feeling really proud of themselves,"
15:26;15:28;"but he's a real deal Buddhist monk."
15:28;15:31;"- Can you imagine his email chain within that hour?"
15:31;15:33;"He goes back to it and it's just like crushed."
15:33;15:35;"- Right."
15:35;15:37;"- His secretary, his assistant is just like,"
15:37;15:40;"listen, you're gonna have to wait."
15:40;15:42;"He doesn't push meditation for any,"
15:42;15:43;"yeah, he's getting like a call"
15:43;15:45;"from like his major distributor in Boston,"
15:45;15:49;"just being like, what, put Bhargava on the phone now."
15:49;15:52;"Sir, he's in the basement meditating."
15:52;15:53;"Oh, what are you kidding me?"
15:53;15:54;"(laughing)"
15:54;15:56;"You go wake him up, shake him,"
15:56;15:58;"whatever you gotta do, I want you to talk to him now."
15:58;16:00;"Good for him."
16:00;16:01;"- What is he, a Buddhist?"
16:01;16:02;"Actually, yeah."
16:02;16:03;"- Actually, he's a Buddhist monk, sir."
16:03;16:04;"- Oh."
16:04;16:05;"Okay."
16:05;16:06;"All right."
16:06;16:07;"- Well, tell him to call me back."
16:07;16:10;"(ominous music)"
16:18;16:22;"(rapping in foreign language)"
17:59;18:05;"(rapping in foreign language)"
18:09;18:13;"(rapping in foreign language)"
18:42;18:44;"- When you say you're a Buddhist,"
18:44;18:46;"it's kind of like saying you're a communist."
18:46;18:47;"- Right."
18:47;18:50;"- Because everybody's like, oh, if you're so whatever,"
18:50;18:52;"which they tend not to do as much"
18:52;18:54;"when you say you're Jewish or Christian or Muslim."
18:54;18:56;"Well, actually, I take that back."
18:56;18:58;"There's people say a lot of crazy stuff."
18:58;19:00;"But, you know, I think when people say you're Buddhist,"
19:00;19:02;"they're like, oh yeah, so what if I punch you in the face?"
19:02;19:03;"You're gonna like--"
19:03;19:04;"- It's all good, bro."
19:04;19:04;"- It's all good, bro."
19:04;19:06;"Oh, what, so that means like you treat all people equal"
19:06;19:07;"or something?"
19:07;19:09;"That means you have no earthly desires, man."
19:09;19:11;"That's what it is."
19:11;19:13;"And you know, like, and also, I think partially"
19:13;19:16;"because obviously some people are raised Buddhist."
19:16;19:20;"Your parents might be Buddhist, but also Buddhism is a,"
19:20;19:21;"you don't have to be born into it"
19:21;19:24;"because in some ways it's a philosophy."
19:24;19:25;"That's what I understood it--"
19:25;19:25;"- Yeah, right."
19:25;19:28;"- From one of my Buddhist teachers in my life."
19:28;19:31;"- Was George Harrison into Buddhism?"
19:31;19:33;"- He, well, he was definitely into Hare Krishna."
19:33;19:34;"- Is that like a lateral move?"
19:34;19:36;"I don't know how that relates to Buddhism."
19:36;19:39;"- Well, I think they're interrelated in that"
19:39;19:41;"Hare Krishna's related to Hinduism."
19:41;19:43;"Hinduism and Buddhism both come from India"
19:43;19:48;"'cause Siddhartha was an Indian prince."
19:48;19:49;"Many of the world's great religion, you know,"
19:49;19:51;"India's like a major cradle of civilization."
19:51;19:54;"So of course there's, Hinduism and Buddhism are interrelated"
19:54;19:55;"and have similar ideas, I think,"
19:55;19:57;"about reality and things like that."
19:57;20:00;"So anyway, because Bhargava is a capitalist Buddhist,"
20:00;20:01;"of course people are gonna raise questions."
20:01;20:05;"And this journalist unearthed some details"
20:05;20:07;"that he describes as sounding un-Buddhist."
20:07;20:09;"Let's see, maybe he's being unfair."
20:09;20:11;"So apparently Bhargava is fond of comparing himself"
20:11;20:14;"to Matt Damon's character in ""Good Will Hunting"""
20:14;20:17;"and refers to himself as the richest Indian in America"
20:17;20:20;"and hasn't been shy about taking out the competition,"
20:20;20:22;"filing 91 lawsuits."
20:22;20:24;"Is that un-Buddhist?"
20:24;20:27;"- Lawsuits against five-hour energy ripoffs?"
20:27;20:29;"- I assume so."
20:29;20:31;"- That seems like an industry that would be rife"
20:31;20:33;"for that kind of thing too, right?"
20:33;20:35;"- Yeah, 'cause it's so shady. - Like the weird gas station."
20:35;20:36;"Yeah."
20:36;20:37;"- It would be interesting just to get this dude's take."
20:37;20:40;"Like, yeah, those questions."
20:40;20:44;"How does your Buddhist practice inform your business?"
20:44;20:44;"- Right."
20:44;20:47;"- Do you ever get into philosophical quandaries?"
20:47;20:50;"- Do you see inherent contradictions"
20:50;20:53;"between American capitalism and being a practicing Buddhist?"
20:53;20:55;"- We could ask this of a lot of people."
20:55;20:58;"You and I both watched the ""Madoff"" movie recently."
20:58;20:59;"- Oh yeah, man."
20:59;21:02;"That's an amazing story."
21:02;21:04;"- Do you feel like any of what you did"
21:04;21:07;"contradicted the rules of your Jewish faith?"
21:07;21:09;"Probably."
21:09;21:11;"Think so."
21:11;21:13;"Thou shalt not steal."
21:13;21:14;"Brutal film."
21:14;21:17;"- Yeah, I mean, I'm listening to this"
21:17;21:21;"long-form audio documentary about him too."
21:21;21:26;"I forget what it's called, but people can find it."
21:26;21:29;"And that's going into much greater detail."
21:29;21:33;"And so I felt like the film, which I really enjoyed,"
21:33;21:35;"also left a lot on the table."
21:35;21:36;"- Right."
21:36;21:39;"- In particular, this long-form audio documentary"
21:39;21:41;"is putting forward this theory"
21:41;21:44;"that a lot of his major investors,"
21:44;21:48;"who were experienced with Wall Street investing,"
21:48;21:50;"had to know what was up."
21:50;21:52;"There's no way that just one human on earth"
21:52;21:54;"could produce these sorts of results."
21:54;21:55;"- Right."
21:55;21:57;"- So they had him over a barrel in a sense,"
21:57;21:59;"'cause they'd be like, they're theorizing"
21:59;22:02;"that there was an unspoken vibe of basically like,"
22:02;22:04;"I'm gonna give you $200 million"
22:04;22:06;"and I want 400 million back in a year."
22:06;22:09;"And if you don't deliver, I'm turning you in."
22:09;22:12;"- So like the smart guys,"
22:12;22:13;"without ever having to say anything,"
22:13;22:15;"they could just look at those numbers, know they're fake,"
22:15;22:17;"and they could essentially be like,"
22:17;22:19;"I'm investing 200 mil with you,"
22:19;22:22;"but the difference between me"
22:22;22:25;"and that poor schmuck who invested his life savings"
22:25;22:28;"is that that guy's gonna leave it with you for 20 years."
22:28;22:29;"- Right."
22:29;22:30;"- And meanwhile, while you're stealing"
22:30;22:31;"all these people's money,"
22:31;22:33;"I'm gonna be the guy who cashes out."
22:33;22:34;"- Yep."
22:34;22:34;"- When people started cashing out,"
22:34;22:35;"you had to cover the losses."
22:35;22:36;"- Yep."
22:36;22:38;"- So if you're somebody who cashed out at the right time--"
22:38;22:40;"- Yeah, if you're just cruising along in like 2004."
22:40;22:42;"- I hope those people had to pay back"
22:42;22:44;"some of their ill-gotten gains."
22:44;22:45;"- I haven't gotten to that part of the documentary yet,"
22:45;22:49;"but I think that's real hard to prove."
22:49;22:54;"There's no way to prove that they were essentially in on it"
22:54;22:55;"and had him over a barrel."
22:55;22:56;"- But even so, they could be like,"
22:56;22:58;"hey guys, your gains?"
22:58;22:59;"- Yeah."
22:59;23:02;"- Just to inform you, man, those gains are ill-gotten."
23:02;23:06;"- I mean, guys, I know you wanna just abscond"
23:06;23:08;"with the bread or whatever, but."
23:08;23:10;"- For what?"
23:10;23:13;"If you abscond with bread."

25:39;25:41;"- Is the capitalistic side of the Grateful Dead at all?"
25:41;25:43;"Is it at odds with their ethos?"
25:43;25:47;"- Funny you say that, 'cause I just watched that documentary."
25:47;25:48;"- How's that?"
25:48;25:50;"- Great, it's called The Long Strange Trip."
25:50;25:52;"It's a four hour documentary."
25:52;25:55;"- The Dead are really having a moment."
25:55;25:58;"How does that make you feel as a long time Dead fan?"
25:58;25:59;"- It's cool, man."
25:59;26:00;"- Now that everybody and their mother,"
26:00;26:02;"all the rappers are wearing vintage Grateful Dead tees."
26:02;26:03;"- Really? - Do you like that?"
26:03;26:04;"Yeah, it's cool."
26:04;26:05;"- It's like, I mean, well, first of all,"
26:05;26:08;"they always had amazing merch."
26:08;26:08;"- Merch. - Yeah."
26:09;26:12;"Their graphic design was so on point."
26:12;26:15;"Their logos, the font choices, so legit."
26:15;26:17;"- Yeah, great branding."
26:17;26:22;"- Great branding before there was self-conscious branding"
26:22;26:24;"in the way that we think of it."
26:24;26:24;"- Right."
26:24;26:27;"- Okay, so their first record came out 50 years ago."
26:27;26:29;"- So the, oh, that's-- - '67."
26:29;26:30;"- This is the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead."
26:30;26:35;"- Yeah, and the doc goes from 65 to 95."
26:35;26:36;"- Yeah."
26:36;26:37;"- When Jerry died, which I love."
26:37;26:39;"The doc ends when Jerry died,"
26:39;26:42;"'cause I was worried that the last hour would be like,"
26:42;26:44;"you know, like John Mayer, like Trey from Phish,"
26:44;26:47;"just like stuff I don't need."
26:47;26:50;"- Episode two, enter Mayer."
26:50;26:52;"- Yeah, it's just like 20 minutes."
26:52;26:53;"- Another four hours on-- - Fare thee well"
26:53;26:55;"from Chicago from two summers ago."
26:55;26:56;"- Right. - We don't need that."
26:56;26:58;"- Yeah. - So it ends with 95."
26:58;27:00;"But anyway, back to this larger theme"
27:00;27:03;"of did capitalism swallow the dead?"
27:03;27:04;"- Yeah. - It kinda did."
27:04;27:06;"Well, it swallowed Jerry."
27:06;27:09;"Like you see the band in the beginning of the film"
27:09;27:13;"as like, you know, it's a local San Francisco band."
27:13;27:15;"- Yeah. - Psychedelic band."
27:15;27:17;"Very adventurous."
27:17;27:19;"All kinds of left turns."
27:19;27:21;"And they're just sort of like an idiosyncratic band"
27:21;27:24;"that's organically growing and changing."
27:24;27:25;"- Yeah."
27:25;27:29;"- And Jerry isn't necessarily this like guru icon."
27:29;27:31;"You know, it's just like he's the front guy,"
27:31;27:33;"but like it's a full band."
27:33;27:35;"And then you see it sort of,"
27:35;27:38;"as they get into the later 70s, into the 80s,"
27:38;27:41;"and they become this stadium rock band."
27:41;27:45;"And like their band sort of evolved with that industry."
27:45;27:46;"'Cause like in the late 60s,"
27:46;27:48;"they're like stadium rock infrastructure."
27:48;27:50;"- They were pioneers of the large scale concert."
27:50;27:53;"- And like they devised the whole wall of sound system"
27:53;27:54;"that they were touring with."
27:54;27:57;"- It's pretty interesting to think that the Grateful Dead,"
27:57;27:59;"because they were pioneers of kind of touring"
27:59;28:01;"and large concerts,"
28:01;28:03;"ultimately the Grateful Dead played to larger crowds"
28:03;28:05;"than the Beatles ever did."
28:05;28:06;"- Oh yeah."
28:06;28:09;"And weirdly, they also were like"
28:09;28:13;"very technologically innovative."
28:13;28:13;"- Yeah."
28:13;28:15;"- Because like, and they actually cover this in the doc,"
28:15;28:17;"in the shows from the 60s,"
28:17;28:19;"there was just like these giant,"
28:19;28:21;"like basically the speakers that you would see"
28:21;28:22;"at like a racetrack."
28:22;28:23;"- Yeah."
28:23;28:25;"- Just like a giant round speaker."
28:25;28:26;"Looked like a giant bullhorn."
28:26;28:30;"That's what a PA was in 1965."
28:30;28:30;"- Almost sounded horrible."
28:30;28:35;"- And then by 75, they had like a 300 speaker system"
28:35;28:38;"that they had to assemble and disassemble"
28:38;28:40;"and then load into three different semi trucks"
28:40;28:41;"after every show."
28:41;28:42;"- Right."
28:42;28:45;"- And so they like kind of invented stadium rock"
28:45;28:48;"as like a high tech spectacle."
28:48;28:49;"- Yeah."
28:49;28:51;"- And then so they get into the 80s"
28:51;28:55;"and it's becoming about like the party,"
28:55;28:57;"the drugs, like for the crowd."
28:57;28:58;"- Right, the parking lot scene."
28:58;28:59;"- The parking lot scene gets huge."
28:59;29:02;"Jerry's like just hooked on heroin."
29:02;29:04;"Like it's brutal."
29:04;29:05;"You see him, as the doc goes,"
29:05;29:09;"you see him getting fatter and grayer"
29:09;29:11;"and like he's singing these songs about death,"
29:11;29:13;"like broke down palace and stuff."
29:13;29:15;"And there's just like this sea of people around him."
29:15;29:18;"So you see him sort of get swallowed"
29:18;29:21;"by the like industry that the dead became."
29:21;29:22;"And then it's really interesting."
29:22;29:24;"There's a point in the doc where they're like,"
29:24;29:25;"they're interviewing Phil Lesch and Bob Ware"
29:25;29:26;"and they're like,"
29:26;29:28;"""We knew Jerry wasn't doing real well,"
29:28;29:32;"""but we had 50 people working for us"
29:32;29:34;"""and we had 50 people whose paychecks we were writing"
29:34;29:37;"""and whose mortgages we were paying."
29:37;29:39;"""So we felt like if we stopped,"
29:39;29:40;"""those people depended on us."
29:40;29:41;"""So what were we supposed to do?"""
29:41;29:44;"Like anyway, and so they're like,"
29:44;29:45;"""We thought Jerry would pull through"
29:45;29:47;"""and kind of like get clean."""
29:47;29:50;"There's amazing footage of Jerry Garcia scuba diving"
29:50;29:53;"in 1993 in Hawaii 'cause he was like obsessed"
29:53;29:53;"with scuba diving."
29:53;29:55;"- Well, yeah, no, I mean that's an interesting comparison"
29:55;29:56;"'cause you're saying like,"
29:56;29:58;"- Yeah. - Here's this guy"
29:58;29:59;"and especially when you watch him"
29:59;30:00;"in his later dead concert,"
30:00;30:02;"it's like Jerry never moved that much"
30:02;30:05;"and towards the end, he's literally just like a statue."
30:05;30:06;"Still shredding."
30:06;30:08;"- Oh my God. - Still tasty licks,"
30:08;30:09;"but he's just like a statue."
30:09;30:11;"So here's this guy."
30:11;30:14;"- Never lost a step in that way."
30:14;30:17;"- But here's this guy who literally,"
30:17;30:19;"at the end of the day, is kind of like a guitar nerd."
30:19;30:21;"You can imagine that when he's at home,"
30:21;30:22;"he's just like, he's doing the same thing."
30:22;30:24;"- There's great footage of him like at home"
30:24;30:26;"in the early '90s with his kids"
30:26;30:28;"and like the TV is on, like Jeopardy is on"
30:28;30:30;"and he's just like shredding on a mandolin."
30:30;30:31;"Like (imitates guitar shredding)"
30:31;30:31;"(laughing)"
30:31;30:32;"- It's just like"
30:32;30:33;"- I love that. - He has a huge grin on his face."
30:33;30:36;"I gotta say the thing, Jerry, as addicted to heroin"
30:36;30:39;"and as like poor as his health was towards the end,"
30:39;30:41;"in interviews, he was always super articulate,"
30:41;30:43;"super charismatic."
30:43;30:45;"- Yeah, and you always came across as like a sweet guy"
30:45;30:46;"and yeah, a sense of humor."
30:46;30:49;"I'm saying, so this guy, the crowds get bigger and bigger"
30:49;30:52;"to the point that this guy is literally surrounded"
30:52;30:56;"by tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of people."
30:56;31:00;"This thing that he started is so much bigger than him now."
31:00;31:01;"- Yeah. - He in a sense"
31:01;31:04;"has been dehumanized as he's become an icon."
31:04;31:05;"- Yep. - 'Cause the process"
31:05;31:07;"of becoming an icon also involves a bit of dehumanization."
31:07;31:09;"- And he hated that. - And he didn't like it"
31:09;31:10;"and he was the one, he was Papa Bear,"
31:10;31:12;"it was so much more about Jerry."
31:12;31:14;"You can imagine that a guy like that,"
31:14;31:17;"it's interesting that his passion, his escape would be"
31:17;31:20;"to go underwater, kind of solo."
31:20;31:21;"- Yep."
31:21;31:23;"- Alone with the animals, alone with your,"
31:23;31:25;"it's like the opposite of being on stage"
31:25;31:27;"with like RFK in front of a full stadium."
31:27;31:30;"- Yeah, Scuba, that was his escape."

32:17;32:19;"- It's a really great movie."
32:19;32:21;"It's a sad film, but it's like a great film."
32:21;32:23;"You see the whole arc of their career,"
32:23;32:27;"the whole ascent and like the changing of America"
32:27;32:30;"between the mid 60s and the mid 90s."
32:30;32:30;"- Yeah, I like ""The Grateful Dead."""
32:30;32:32;"- It's a deep American story."
32:32;32:36;"- I really like ""The Dead"" and I often think about how"
32:36;32:39;"they're very inspiring to musicians and bands"
32:39;32:41;"and you know, as long as I've been doing it,"
32:41;32:42;"we talk about ""The Grateful Dead."""
32:42;32:44;"I hear other people talk about ""The Grateful Dead,"""
32:44;32:46;"but it's always been interesting that,"
32:46;32:47;"I was starting to think like,"
32:47;32:49;"I hear so many people talk about ""The Grateful Dead"""
32:49;32:49;"and I don't know if they're really"
32:49;32:50;"musically influenced by them."
32:50;32:53;"And I think the main reason why bands look up"
32:53;32:55;"to ""The Grateful Dead"" so much is because"
32:55;32:59;"that's kind of the dream is that you could unhitch"
32:59;33:01;"from a cultural moment and do your own thing."
33:01;33:03;"And even if your record stops selling,"
33:03;33:08;"you don't have any hits, you know, it's 1979."
33:08;33:13;"The Clash is like the coolest band and like ELO,"
33:13;33:14;"you know, there's like these,"
33:14;33:16;"and now there's the big bands."
33:16;33:18;"So you're neither cool nor big on the charts"
33:18;33:20;"and yet what are you doing?"
33:20;33:21;"It's like--"
33:21;33:23;"- You're playing at 12,000 people in Oklahoma."
33:23;33:25;"- Right, that's what all bands kind of dream of"
33:25;33:27;"is that you could, so in a way,"
33:27;33:29;"even though they're part of this capitalist machine,"
33:29;33:33;"they also kind of represent some type of escape from it."
33:33;33:37;"That like, you could unhitch from all like the local scene"
33:37;33:39;"and the rivalries and the competition and stuff"
33:39;33:41;"and that's the dream."
33:41;33:44;"It's like your crew out there,"
33:44;33:45;"doesn't matter how you chart,"
33:45;33:47;"doesn't matter what the critics say,"
33:47;33:49;"you're out there playing"
33:49;33:51;"and the shows get bigger and bigger."
33:51;33:53;"That's what everybody dreams of, I think."
33:53;33:55;"- They're like America's greatest cult band."
33:55;33:56;"- Yeah, exactly."
33:56;34:00;"- Second, maybe only to Insane Clown Posse."
34:00;34:01;"- I mean, in a way."
34:01;34:02;"- ICP, man."
34:02;34:03;"- In a way."
34:03;34:05;"- I mean, I thought of ICP when you described that,"
34:05;34:06;"like that's their own scene."
34:06;34:08;"- Yeah, when imagine--"
34:08;34:09;"- Forget the critics."
34:09;34:11;"- Insane Clown Posse started like what,"
34:11;34:14;"in the 90s or something, you know?"
34:14;34:16;"- Yeah, like mid 90s Detroit."
34:16;34:19;"- They have like a yearly massive festival."
34:19;34:20;"Their fans care about them as deeply"
34:20;34:22;"as any of these other people's."
34:22;34:23;"Yeah, that's kind of the dream"
34:23;34:26;"and they make a living and they support their families"
34:26;34:27;"and crew like--"
34:27;34:31;"- Eventually, there'll be some like super reverent ICP doc."
34:31;34:34;"- Yeah, you know, who was it Gandhi said,"
34:34;34:38;"first they laugh at you, then--"
34:38;34:40;"- Then you get elected president?"
34:40;34:42;"- Yeah, then you get elected president."
34:42;34:45;"But first they laugh at you, you got something popping."
34:45;34:48;"People are gonna ridicule you at first."
34:48;34:49;"When there's something different"
34:49;34:52;"and it's making some waves, people will make fun of it"
34:52;34:53;"until they can no longer make fun of it."
34:53;34:56;"And they have to be like, okay, now we're getting serious."
34:56;34:59;"It's kind of like ICP is a joke, ha ha."
34:59;35:01;"Look at these like dudes in the Midwest,"
35:01;35:03;"drinking Faygo, painting their face, ha ha."
35:03;35:06;"And then it gets kind of big and you're like, huh,"
35:06;35:09;"this sucks because then you've got to fight it."
35:09;35:10;"And then eventually you just got to give in"
35:10;35:12;"and be like, these guys are doing their thing,"
35:12;35:14;"they're not hurting anybody."

37:36;37:38;"the de facto keeper of the fan emails."
37:38;37:39;"- Yep."
37:39;37:42;"People find me online somehow."
37:42;37:44;"- People find you online."
37:44;37:47;"Apparently it's not that hard to find your email."
37:47;37:50;"But we're starting to get a decent volume fairly regularly."
37:50;37:51;"- Yeah."
37:51;37:54;"- We get some great emails and we appreciate all of them."
37:54;37:56;"Unfortunately, sometimes we get it"
37:56;37:58;"and we're not taping for a while, we kind of forget."
37:58;38:01;"But today we wanna dig into the mailbag"
38:01;38:06;"and connect with the Time Crisis family."
38:06;38:08;"So here's an email from Anna Koppelman."
38:08;38:11;"The subject reads as follows,"
38:11;38:14;"""Urgent, my boyfriend came out as a Chainsmokers fan."""
38:14;38:16;"Her email reads as follows,"
38:16;38:19;"""Hey Jake, Ezra and the rest of the Crisis crew."
38:19;38:22;"""First, I wanna say that your show gives me so much joy."
38:22;38:24;"""Not to be an overly dramatic fangirl,"
38:24;38:25;"""but it's kind of the only thing"
38:25;38:26;"""that gets me through the fact"
38:26;38:29;"""that some of my close-minded high school classmates"
38:29;38:31;"""like Brad's drink more than Coke."""
38:31;38:32;"- That is tough."
38:32;38:33;"- Ooh, that's brutal."
38:33;38:34;"You remember that, like in high school?"
38:34;38:36;"- That's across the bear."
38:36;38:37;"- Yeah, like once you get to college,"
38:37;38:39;"you don't have to hang out with those Brad's drink people."
38:39;38:41;"But you know, sometimes you go to high school"
38:41;38:44;"in a small town, a lot of people drinking Brad's drink,"
38:44;38:45;"you're stuck."
38:45;38:49;"You kind of just gotta grin and bear it 'til graduation."
38:49;38:51;"Anyway, she says, ""I could wax poetic"
38:51;38:52;"""about you guys all day,"
38:52;38:53;"""but I think I should get to the point"
38:53;38:55;"""because I'm in need of dire help."
38:55;38:58;"""I've been dating a guy for around three months."
38:58;39:01;"""He's smart, funny, kind, and caring."
39:01;39:04;"""But today I found out that he's a fan of the Chainsmokers"
39:04;39:06;"""and that he likes the song Closer."
39:06;39:08;"""Does this mean I have to break up with him?"
39:08;39:10;"""If I don't, how am I supposed to proceed"
39:10;39:11;"""in such a relationship?"
39:11;39:13;"""I'd really appreciate the advice here."
39:13;39:14;"""Thanks for everything."
39:14;39:15;"""Best, Anna."""
39:15;39:16;"- Wow."
39:16;39:17;"- Well, you know, first things first,"
39:17;39:20;"there's a bit of a divide in the Time Crisis family"
39:20;39:23;"because when I hear that anybody"
39:23;39:26;"is dating a Chainsmokers fan, I say congratulations."
39:26;39:27;"- Job well done."
39:27;39:29;"- Job well done."
39:29;39:31;"I consider that the icing on the cake."
39:31;39:34;"Whereas Jake, you've been a lot tougher on the Smokers."
39:34;39:35;"- Not a fan, particularly."
39:35;39:36;"- Not a fan."
39:36;39:38;"- I don't think Anna should break up with this guy"
39:38;39:41;"if he is smart, funny, kind, and caring."
39:41;39:43;"I don't think Anna really is even asking us"
39:43;39:44;"for a real opinion."
39:44;39:47;"I think it's a pretty tongue-in-cheek email."
39:47;39:47;"- I will."
39:47;39:48;"- It's a sweet email."
39:48;39:49;"I'm glad she wrote it."
39:49;39:50;"- It's a sweet email."
39:50;39:51;"- If she broke up with him because of that,"
39:51;39:53;"well, no matter how old you are."
39:53;39:55;"- Well, she says she's in high school."
39:55;39:57;"- She's smart, funny, kind, and caring."
39:57;40:00;"- We'd have to meet the guy, I think."
40:00;40:03;"Should we find Anna's boyfriend out to LA?"
40:03;40:08;"- Okay, how am I supposed to proceed in such a relationship?"
40:08;40:10;"Just don't talk about the Chainsmokers."
40:10;40:13;"- Okay, but it does bring up an interesting question."
40:13;40:14;"- Here we go."
40:14;40:16;"- We talk so much about the Chainsmokers on this show"
40:16;40:19;"because they're such a huge part of American culture."
40:19;40:23;"When we look back on 2016, 2017,"
40:23;40:25;"when the dust has settled,"
40:25;40:28;"these years are gonna be defined by Trump,"
40:28;40:31;"the Chainsmokers, and I don't know."
40:31;40:31;"- Kanye?"
40:31;40:35;"- Not even."
40:35;40:36;"Maybe Kim."
40:36;40:37;"- Trump and the Chainsmokers."
40:37;40:39;"- Instagram."
40:39;40:40;"- Oh, no, hold on."
40:40;40:42;"Drake, Meekin."
40:42;40:42;"Okay."
40:42;40:45;"- No, but the Chainsmokers more than anybody."
40:45;40:47;"- That's right, 'cause they had a song in the top 10"
40:47;40:48;"every week of the past year."
40:48;40:50;"- They were massive."
40:50;40:52;"So my question is, despite how big they are,"
40:52;40:54;"they're a massive, huge part of our culture,"
40:54;40:55;"I personally have never met anybody"
40:55;40:58;"who identifies as a Chainsmokers fan."
40:58;41:01;"Now, people know that my primary job"
41:01;41:04;"is working in the music industry,"
41:04;41:06;"which is full of liberal elites,"
41:06;41:10;"and those people turn their noses up at the Chainsmokers."
41:10;41:12;"And I'll always be like, ""Come on, guys."
41:12;41:14;"""Is that song really that bad?"""
41:14;41:15;"A lot of people that I'm surrounded by,"
41:15;41:16;"they're like, ""Yeah, it is."""
41:16;41:18;"They hate on these guys."
41:18;41:23;"- Also, you're hanging with people over the age of 25."
41:23;41:24;"- For the most part."
41:24;41:26;"- You're not hanging with a lot of 17-year-olds."
41:26;41:27;"Or are you?"
41:27;41:31;"- I question if, I don't think the average Chainsmokers fan"
41:31;41:33;"is a high school student, actually."
41:33;41:34;"- Really?"
41:34;41:36;"- Yeah, because think about it."
41:36;41:37;"- Like what age?"
41:37;41:38;"- I don't know."
41:38;41:41;"I remember once I went to a fun concert,"
41:41;41:43;"and the average age was 29."
41:43;41:44;"- Tonight!"
41:44;41:47;"- I think, okay, also, just picture"
41:47;41:48;"when you were in high school,"
41:48;41:51;"and there's some big pop artists."
41:51;41:52;"- Like Weezer."
41:52;41:54;"- No, no, pop."
41:54;41:56;"Weezer was not the Chainsmokers of their day."
41:56;41:58;"- Like Backstreet Boys?"
41:58;41:59;"- No, Chainsmokers aren't like that."
41:59;42:00;"- Yeah, there's no analog,"
42:00;42:03;"there's no '90s analog to the Chainsmokers."
42:03;42:04;"- I'm just saying, I think when you go see"
42:04;42:08;"the Chainsmokers in Vegas, you're getting a lot of dads."
42:08;42:09;"- That's weird."
42:09;42:11;"- Especially in our modern culture, where--"
42:11;42:12;"- Dads?"
42:12;42:13;"- You know, everybody reads Harry Potter,"
42:13;42:15;"everybody listens to the same music."
42:15;42:16;"- Everyone's just a 14-year-old."
42:16;42:18;"- I pictured a lot of 14-year-olds,"
42:18;42:21;"their dads are like, I'm on a business trip in Vegas,"
42:21;42:23;"and I'm gonna go see the Chainsmokers."
42:23;42:24;"- Oh, my cousin."
42:24;42:26;"- Like your cousin."
42:26;42:28;"- Who's like 45."
42:28;42:29;"- And who did he see in Vegas?"
42:29;42:31;"- Maroon 5."
42:31;42:31;"- Exactly."
42:31;42:34;"So picture like your cousin, or like a dad,"
42:34;42:36;"who's on a trip, and they go see Maroon 5,"
42:36;42:40;"and then they tell their like 15-year-old son or daughter,"
42:40;42:41;"""Oh, and here's something pretty cool,"
42:41;42:44;"""your old dad saw Maroon 5 out in Vegas, man."
42:44;42:46;"""Those guys killed it."""
42:46;42:49;"And then the 15-year-old's like, ""Oh, my God."""
42:49;42:50;"Don't you think that probably happens with the Chainsmokers?"
42:50;42:52;"- So you think the dad's going to the Chainsmokers show"
42:52;42:54;"just to get crad with the kid?"
42:54;42:57;"- No, because the dad feels like it's cool."
42:57;43:00;"Okay, my point is, I just don't know any Chainsmokers fans,"
43:00;43:03;"and if I had to imagine the average Chainsmokers fan,"
43:03;43:07;"I'm picturing a 25-year-old dude,"
43:07;43:08;"oh, man, actually, I don't know."
43:08;43:10;"- Working at like a T-Mobile store?"
43:10;43:11;"- Well, sometimes with the bigot,"
43:11;43:14;"these really big pop artists who make massive hits,"
43:14;43:16;"they don't have fans in the traditional sense,"
43:16;43:19;"like Ariana Grande, who was in the news recently."
43:19;43:20;"- Yeah."
43:20;43:21;"- You know, people were talking a lot"
43:21;43:22;"about how dedicated her fan base is,"
43:22;43:25;"and they have a name that's like the Arianators"
43:25;43:28;"or something, Arianators."
43:28;43:30;"They're dedicated to her, they follow her every move,"
43:30;43:32;"they go to the shows."
43:32;43:35;"Chainsmokers have had bigger hits than Ariana Grande,"
43:35;43:37;"and yet I don't think they have, numerically,"
43:37;43:39;"the type of fan base, you know what I mean?"
43:39;43:41;"'Cause they don't inspire that type of fandom."
43:41;43:42;"I'm just saying, I don't know,"
43:42;43:43;"I just don't think there's a lot"
43:43;43:44;"of like hardcore Chainsmokers fans."
43:44;43:46;"So I wonder with Anna's boyfriend,"
43:46;43:48;"is this dude like, did she go over to his,"
43:48;43:51;"he's like finally comes, she comes over to his house,"
43:51;43:54;"is in his room, and he's got a Chainsmokers poster"
43:54;43:55;"and the T-shirt and stuff,"
43:55;43:57;"or is it more like Closer came on the radio"
43:57;43:59;"and she was like, ""Oh my God, I hate this song,"
43:59;44:03;"""turn it off,"" and he was like, ""I like it, I'm a fan."""
44:03;44:04;"That seems like a little more likely."
44:04;44:05;"- Yeah."
44:05;44:08;"- If this dude's a diehard Chainsmokers like head,"
44:08;44:12;"that does strike me as weird."
44:12;44:12;"- Yup."
44:12;44:14;"- But I just like, it's cool, I like it,"
44:14;44:15;"it's not a bad song, and he's right about that."
44:15;44:17;"- Okay Anna, so, slow your roll."
44:17;44:22;"You're not gonna agree on everything with your boyfriend."
44:22;44:25;"He loves House of Cards, you don't."
44:25;44:26;"- What's the biggest cultural product"
44:26;44:28;"you and your girlfriend disagree on?"
44:28;44:29;"- Hmm, that's a good one."
44:29;44:31;"Maybe Game of Thrones, I don't watch it."
44:31;44:33;"I think it's garbage."
44:33;44:33;"- And she likes it?"
44:33;44:35;"- Yeah, but she doesn't even really like,"
44:35;44:37;"she's not like ride or die for it."
44:37;44:38;"- Yeah."
44:38;44:39;"- Music is funnier too, to like--"
44:39;44:42;"- Well you love that show Designated Survivor"
44:42;44:43;"with Kiefer Sutherland."
44:43;44:44;"- No, that's a solo journey."
44:44;44:46;"- So you're watching that, and you're just like,"
44:46;44:49;"this is, wow, what a great show."
44:49;44:51;"My love, will you please join me on the couch"
44:51;44:53;"for this week's episode of Designated Survivor?"
44:53;44:56;"And she's like, no, that show sucks, peace."
44:56;44:58;"- No, she'll just sort of laugh at me."
44:58;44:59;"- Okay, but that's your show."
44:59;45:00;"- Yeah, yeah."
45:00;45:02;"- I remember growing up that my mom would sometimes"
45:02;45:05;"be like, daddy's watching his show in the basement."
45:05;45:08;"My dad would be like taking down a--"
45:08;45:09;"- Like NYPD Blue or something?"
45:09;45:12;"- No, I mean, I remember being a kid"
45:12;45:14;"and he watched Star Trek The Next Generation."
45:14;45:15;"- Oh man."
45:15;45:19;"- He was into that, and that was dad's show."
45:19;45:20;"- Yeah, my folks are kind of like that too."
45:20;45:23;"My mom's like, dad's watching his cop shows."
45:23;45:24;"- Uh-huh."
45:24;45:26;"- My dad will watch the crappiest cop shows."
45:26;45:29;"My dad watches Blue Bloods."
45:29;45:29;"- Oh, with Tom Selleck?"
45:29;45:30;"- Yeah."
45:30;45:31;"- I bet that's good."
45:31;45:34;"- It's like a straight up old school network cop show."
45:34;45:38;"- I like when it's surprising, that's so heteronormative."
45:38;45:40;"Dad likes cop shows."
45:40;45:44;"- Yeah, yeah, my mom got real into The Good Wife."
45:44;45:48;"Oh, these are shows I have not seen."
45:48;45:49;"- These are grown folks shows."
45:49;45:50;"- Yeah, yeah."
45:50;45:52;"- You don't need to agree on everything."
45:52;45:53;"In fact, in a relationship,"
45:53;45:54;"it's important to have space sometimes."
45:54;45:55;"- Absolutely."
45:55;45:57;"- You don't wanna watch every show together,"
45:57;45:59;"listen to every song together."
45:59;46:01;"- I'm still thinking on the music stuff."
46:01;46:02;"- Does your girlfriend like The Grateful Dead?"
46:02;46:03;"- Yeah, yeah, she's into The Dead."
46:03;46:04;"I got her into The Dead."
46:04;46:06;"- Does she like Guided By Voices?"
46:06;46:09;"- Yeah, she likes going to the shows with me,"
46:09;46:11;"I think GBV is a fun experience,"
46:11;46:13;"but I don't think she's throwing on GBV in her car."
46:13;46:14;"- Right."
46:14;46:16;"It's kinda cool when you meet somebody"
46:16;46:18;"who likes something that you don't like."
46:18;46:21;"It's like, that's kinda more interesting in a way."
46:21;46:22;"- Totally."
46:22;46:23;"- Like when you meet somebody who likes the same thing as you"
46:23;46:25;"and you can just be like,"
46:25;46:27;"that becomes like an old school Chris Farley show,"
46:27;46:29;"just like, that was pretty cool, right?"
46:29;46:30;"- Yeah, that was cool."
46:30;46:33;"- Remember when GBV released that album?"
46:33;46:34;"- Yeah."
46:34;46:35;"- That was cool, right?"
46:35;46:37;"Whereas it's interesting when somebody's into something"
46:37;46:39;"that you really don't know about,"
46:39;46:41;"and it's kinda like, oh, that's cool,"
46:41;46:42;"what do you like about it?"
46:42;46:44;"Oh, that's cool, when did you get into it?"
46:44;46:46;"Oh, that's interesting, I don't know, that's cooler."
46:46;46:47;"- Yeah."
46:47;46:48;"- So actually, Anna, I think it's great,"
46:48;46:50;"and I hope that there's something that you like"
46:50;46:52;"that he doesn't like, just so that it's even."
46:52;46:54;"So he'll teach you about chain smokers"
46:54;46:55;"and you can teach him about--"
46:55;46:58;"- Maybe be open, Anna, to the chain smokers."
46:58;47:00;"Maybe he can introduce an angle to you"
47:00;47:02;"that you didn't see about them."

48:03;48:05;"This one's from Ryan Campbell out in Kansas City."
48:05;48:07;"The real deep time crisis heads know"
48:07;48:10;"that we put up a playlist recently."
48:10;48:12;"And you made it, Jake."
48:12;48:13;"- Oh, the Home Depot playlist."
48:13;48:15;"- This was kind of a fantasy playlist"
48:15;48:16;"about what you would like to hear"
48:16;48:17;"when you go to Home Depot."
48:17;48:21;"- If we got the gig to curate the playlist at Home Depot."
48:21;48:23;"- And generally speaking,"
48:23;48:26;"as anyone who knows you would probably guess,"
48:26;48:28;"you wanted to hear a lot of the tasteful palette"
48:28;48:30;"of '70s rock."
48:30;48:34;"- Yeah, but I was thinking about also a retail environment."
48:34;48:36;"So I catered the playlist."
48:37;48:38;"- Yeah, it was a lot of like,"
48:38;48:42;"kind of middle of the road dad rock."
48:42;48:42;"- Right."
48:42;48:44;"- So it was a little bit tongue in cheek,"
48:44;48:46;"but I also wanted to choose the best stuff"
48:46;48:50;"from that genre/palette."
48:50;48:53;"- So Ryan from Kansas City is at least one person"
48:53;48:55;"who actually put that playlist to use."
48:55;48:58;"He writes, ""I had an occasion to go get some zip ties"
48:58;49:01;"and a staple gun."""
49:01;49:02;"- That's interesting."
49:02;49:03;"- Love that combo."
49:03;49:04;"- That sounds like a serial killer."
49:04;49:06;"- Yeah, kind of zip ties."
49:06;49:08;"- Zip ties and a staple gun."
49:08;49:10;"- Yeah, that's a weird."
49:10;49:12;"- He's like, okay, you know what he's doing?"
49:12;49:12;"- What?"
49:12;49:15;"- He's running a bunch of cable and extension cords"
49:15;49:17;"in his like room or like his basement."
49:17;49:18;"- Oh, he's trying to make sure they're neat."
49:18;49:19;"- Yeah."
49:19;49:20;"- He's bundling the cords."
49:20;49:23;"- He's gonna zip tie the cords and then staple gun"
49:23;49:27;"the little like plastic lip or whatever into the wall."
49:27;49:28;"That's what he's doing."
49:28;49:30;"- Ryan, let us know if that's true."
49:30;49:33;"So yeah, he had an occasion to go get some zip ties"
49:33;49:35;"and a staple gun from Home Depot"
49:35;49:37;"and relish the opportunity to pump your custom made"
49:37;49:39;"playlist during my suburban errand."
49:39;49:42;"I appreciate that there are still rock buffs out there"
49:42;49:44;"to do hard work like this."
49:44;49:46;"BTW have been converted from a slightly casual listener"
49:46;49:49;"of the Grateful Dead to a heavy user thanks to you."
49:49;49:50;"Ryan from Kansas City."
49:50;49:52;"- Great email, Ryan."
49:52;49:55;"- The rock buff community is dwindling."
49:55;49:56;"- Time marches on."
49:56;49:58;"- Time marches on, as it should."
49:58;49:59;"But you know, there's still some out there"
49:59;50:00;"and that's cool, man."
50:00;50:03;"You turned Ryan into a heavy Grateful Dead listener."
50:03;50:05;"- What if that Home Depot was in Kansas City,"
50:05;50:08;"city limits or suburban?"
50:08;50:10;"- Well, he used the word suburban in there."
50:10;50:11;"Well, you know what?"
50:11;50:12;"- Missouri?"
50:12;50:13;"- Well, or Kansas."
50:13;50:15;"That's a big question."
50:15;50:16;"- Ryan, you gotta get back to us."
50:16;50:17;"- Well, 'cause you know, like a lot of these"
50:17;50:19;"Midwestern cities, I always notice this."
50:19;50:21;"'Cause we both grew up in the New York metro area,"
50:21;50:23;"the tri-state area."
50:23;50:25;"Me growing up in Jersey, you growing up in Connecticut."
50:25;50:25;"- CT."
50:25;50:30;"- When, because New York and especially what's often"
50:30;50:32;"referred to as the city, the island of Manhattan"
50:32;50:35;"is surrounded by water, of course."
50:35;50:37;"When people ask where you're from,"
50:37;50:39;"in New York it's like this real thing."
50:39;50:41;"Like people who grew up in the city."
50:41;50:43;"You can't just be from Long Island or Jersey or whatever"
50:43;50:46;"and say, well, you know, I was in New York."
50:46;50:48;"Whereas in other places, it's not such a big,"
50:48;50:50;"I think if you're from Kansas City or you know,"
50:50;50:54;"or like if you're from a kind of suburb of Houston,"
50:54;50:55;"these kind of larger sprawling cities"
50:55;50:57;"that aren't surrounded by a body of water,"
50:57;50:59;"it's cool, it's no big deal."
50:59;51:00;"- Right."
51:00;51:02;"You say you're from Galveston or you just"
51:02;51:04;"say you're from Houston, Houston Metro."
51:04;51:06;"- No, well, Galveston is, is Galveston"
51:06;51:07;"part of the Houston Metro area?"
51:07;51:08;"- Oh, I thought it was."
51:08;51:09;"- No, you're way off, Jake."
51:09;51:10;"- Okay, my bad."
51:10;51:10;"- Wow, man, I'm surprised."
51:10;51:13;"♪ Galveston, oh, Galveston ♪"
51:13;51:15;"- Galveston's on the water."
51:15;51:16;"- You're right."
51:16;51:17;"- It's a seaside town."
51:17;51:19;"- You're totally right."
51:19;51:21;"- Now, I think you're allowed to be from a suburb"
51:21;51:24;"of Kansas City and say I'm from Kansas City."
51:24;51:25;"- Yeah."
51:25;51:26;"- I don't know, it's hard."
51:26;51:26;"- I was just worried, I was just worried."
51:26;51:28;"- New York's the biggest snobs."
51:28;51:28;"- Yeah."
51:28;51:30;"- It's hard to imagine that somebody who's from like"
51:30;51:33;"Kansas City would be like, oh, really?"
51:33;51:34;"You're from Kansas City?"
51:34;51:35;"I think you're from 20 minutes outside"
51:35;51:36;"the city limits, friend."
51:36;51:38;"- I was just curious about the Home Depot,"
51:38;51:41;"like if there's Home Depots within city limits."
51:41;51:42;"- Oh, there must be."
51:42;51:44;"Well, I guess going to Home Depot is a suburban errand,"
51:44;51:45;"even if you do it in the--"
51:45;51:46;"- I wonder if Ryan was doing earbuds"

52:59;53:05;"- Well, anyway, Jake, clearly your Home Depot playlist"
53:05;53:07;"has made some real waves in the Time Crisis community."
53:07;53:10;"- Yeah, we've gotten a few other emails and tweets about it."
53:10;53:12;"- People are appreciating it."
53:12;53:13;"And the truth is, Time Crisis,"
53:13;53:15;"we haven't done a lot of playlists."
53:15;53:16;"- Yep."
53:16;53:19;"- 'Cause actually, they put up a playlist of every show,"
53:19;53:21;"the music we play, but you know,"
53:21;53:21;"that ends up being like a little random."
53:21;53:23;"- So random, yeah."
53:23;53:24;"- That's not as curated."
53:24;53:26;"- Yeah."
53:26;53:28;"- So Jake, you've actually been working on another playlist"
53:28;53:29;"for the Time Crisis community."
53:29;53:31;"- I was inspired recently,"
53:31;53:33;"'cause I've been going to the gym a lot more these days,"
53:33;53:35;"the last few months."
53:35;53:38;"And then my brother and I go to this kickboxing class"
53:38;53:41;"on Saturday mornings at this gym in Eagle Rock."
53:41;53:45;"It's a group kickboxing class, very co-ed."
53:45;53:46;"You know, it's like a room of like 20 people,"
53:46;53:49;"and there's a bunch of those hanging punching bags."
53:49;53:50;"- Yeah."
53:50;53:53;"- And you like lace up and you glove up,"
53:53;53:55;"and then you're just like punching bags,"
53:55;53:56;"you're kicking the bags."
53:56;53:57;"- You're kicking."
53:57;53:58;"- You're doing push-ups, you're doing lunges."
53:58;54:01;"You know, it's just like a hardcore hour"
54:01;54:03;"with like the instructor with a wireless headset mic"
54:03;54:05;"just being like, ""Okay guys."""
54:05;54:08;"It's fun, it's like a fun way to do like a Saturday morning"
54:08;54:09;"with your brother."
54:09;54:13;"But so they're blasting tunes every Saturday."
54:13;54:16;"- Does the instructor kind of DJ?"
54:16;54:17;"- Yeah, he makes a playlist."
54:17;54:18;"- There's no DJ in the corner?"
54:18;54:20;"- No, no, no."
54:20;54:21;"- Because that's not a joke."
54:21;54:22;"- What, that's a thing?"
54:22;54:25;"- There are legitimately exercise classes all around America"
54:25;54:27;"where there's a DJ in the room."
54:27;54:32;"- Wow, that's not a gym that I'm going to."
54:32;54:33;"- So no DJ?"
54:33;54:34;"- No DJ, he's making a playlist."
54:34;54:36;"- Okay, I hope he's getting paid extra for that."
54:36;54:37;"- And each week is different."
54:37;54:39;"You know, I remember one week it was sort of like"
54:39;54:43;"late 80s, early 90s, kind of like New Jack."
54:43;54:43;"- Oh, cool."
54:43;54:45;"- And then another week it'll be like--"
54:45;54:47;"- It's just like, ""That girl is poison."""
54:47;54:48;"- Yeah."
54:48;54:48;"- And you're just like kicking the bags."
54:48;54:49;"- Yeah."
54:49;54:51;"(grunting)"
54:51;54:53;"- Or like another week it was like,"
54:53;54:56;"kind of like 80s, just like power ballads."
54:56;54:59;"It was like Phil Collins, like,"
54:59;55:00;"♪ I can feel it ♪"
55:00;55:01;"♪ Come on ♪"
55:01;55:03;"Like real slow, like kind of intense."
55:03;55:04;"- Wow."
55:04;55:05;"- I appreciate the risks he's taking."
55:05;55:07;"So then anyway, I was talking with him"
55:07;55:08;"and talking with my brother"
55:08;55:09;"and we were joking around about like,"
55:09;55:11;"oh no, so then Chris Cornell died."
55:11;55:12;"- Right."
55:12;55:13;"- RIP."
55:13;55:14;"- RIP."
55:14;55:16;"- We were like, yo, are you going to play some Chris Cornell"
55:16;55:17;"like some Soundgarden?"
55:17;55:18;"He's like, I could."
55:18;55:19;"What should I play?"
55:19;55:21;"And I was like, Rusty Cage, dude."
55:22;55:24;"So he throws in Rusty Cage."
55:24;55:27;"- Ooh, nice guitar tone."
55:27;55:28;"- It got me thinking."
55:28;55:30;"I was just like, okay, I'd love to make like a,"
55:30;55:34;"like a hard rock, not like Sabbath and Van Halen,"
55:34;55:39;"but like a kind of alternative music playlists."
55:39;55:40;"- No metal."
55:40;55:41;"- Not metal either."
55:41;55:42;"Yeah, 'cause they play Metallica."
55:42;55:43;"But then I was like,"
55:43;55:45;"I was like, it'd be interesting,"
55:45;55:48;"like a punk, post-punk and alternative."
55:48;55:50;"I was thinking about Michael Azarad's book about,"
55:50;55:52;"like kind of 80s, independent."
55:52;55:53;"- Yeah, like American Underground."
55:53;55:54;"- Right."
55:54;55:57;"- And I was thinking like, punk, post-punk and alternative."
55:57;55:59;"There's like a nice continuum."
55:59;56:00;"All the music's really aggressive."
56:00;56:03;"It's not indie, 'cause indie's not really aggressive."
56:03;56:03;"- Rarely."
56:03;56:04;"- It's not up-tempo."
56:04;56:05;"- Yeah."
56:05;56:07;"- But like punk rock and post-punk,"
56:07;56:10;"and then like right into like Soundgarden"
56:10;56:13;"and even like the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
56:13;56:13;"- Yeah."
56:13;56:15;"- They were alternative before they were like"
56:15;56:18;"kind of corny mainstream,"
56:18;56:20;"the way they've been in the last like 15, 20 years."
56:20;56:21;"- Yeah, they were hard."
56:21;56:23;"- Like late 80s, early 90s."
56:23;56:25;"So I made this punk, post-punk"
56:25;56:27;"and alternative workout playlist."
56:27;56:30;"- Do you think it's gonna get played in the class?"
56:30;56:30;"- I could bring it in."
56:30;56:31;"I should bring it in."
56:31;56:33;"- Would you be embarrassed or proud"
56:33;56:35;"if at the beginning of the class he's like,"
56:35;56:37;"by the way guys, one of our regulars, Jake,"
56:37;56:40;"put together a playlist for today's class."
56:40;56:42;"It's focusing on punk and post-punk."
56:42;56:44;"Jake, raise your hand."
56:44;56:45;"- I'd be--"
56:45;56:46;"- Thanks a lot, man."
56:46;56:47;"- I'd be embarrassed."
56:47;56:48;"- And he's like, let's do this."
56:48;56:50;"- He puts on Soundgarden."
56:50;56:53;"You just like see somebody grimace."
56:53;56:55;"- Oh, I think people would be in."
56:55;56:56;"But I would be embarrassed still."
56:56;56:59;"- Would you actually prefer to work out to this music"
56:59;57:01;"than to Phil Collins?"
57:01;57:02;"- Maybe some days."
57:02;57:03;"Not every day."
57:03;57:04;"- Right."
57:04;57:06;"But you like up-tempo?"
57:06;57:07;"- Yeah."
57:07;57:09;"And yeah, this is very up-tempo."
57:09;57:09;"It's very aggressive."
57:09;57:10;"He's got a playlist."
57:10;57:12;"- So what else do you put on it?"
57:12;57:13;"- What is it?"
57:13;57:15;"I think it's like 81 to like 92 or something."
57:15;57:20;"My playlist is very up-tempo, very aggressive."
57:20;57:21;"You're gonna love it."
57:21;57:22;"- What's on here?"
57:22;57:23;"Fugazi."
57:23;57:25;"(rock music)"
57:25;57:32;"- All right, I'm noticing, yeah,"
57:32;57:34;"so you like some crunchy, distorted guitars."
57:34;57:39;"- Okay, making this playlist made me think about"
57:39;57:44;"early '90s alternative music."
57:44;57:45;"- Yeah."
57:45;57:47;"- And that there's like an inherent aggression"
57:47;57:48;"in that music."
57:48;57:50;"'Cause I was like trying to like fit in"
57:50;57:54;"like some like pavement or like some like classic indie."
57:54;57:55;"And I was like--"
57:55;57:56;"- Didn't make sense."
57:56;57:57;"- Or even R.E.M."
57:57;57:58;"- Right."
57:58;57:59;"- I was like, oh, R.E.M. put out some great"
57:59;58:02;"kind of up-tempo numbers in the early '80s."
58:02;58:04;"And it wasn't fitting."
58:04;58:05;"- Yeah."
58:05;58:06;"- And I was like, oh, that's indie."
58:06;58:08;"- By the way, this, when it got,"
58:08;58:10;"I'm picturing them actually playing this in your class,"
58:10;58:13;"when it gets to this song is when like somebody"
58:13;58:14;"just like goes up to the instructor"
58:14;58:15;"and like whispers in his ear."
58:15;58:17;"And he's like, all right, Jake,"
58:17;58:18;"thanks so much for the playlist."
58:18;58:20;"We're gonna get back to my Phil Collins mix."
58:20;58:24;"This is cool, though."
58:24;58:24;"- Yeah, yeah."
58:24;58:25;"- I like Fugazi."
58:25;58:27;"- Okay, here's another classic."
58:27;58:30;"Dead Kennedys."
58:30;58:32;"- Oh, Holiday in Cambodia."
58:32;58:33;"- No, no, no."
58:33;58:34;"- Oh, California Browse."
58:34;58:35;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
58:38;58:41;"This is a weird song."
58:41;58:41;"- Yeah."
58:41;58:44;"- Jerry Brown is currently our governor."
58:44;58:45;"- Yeah."
58:47;58:54;"♪ I am governor of Jerry Brown ♪"
58:54;58:57;"♪ I are a smile that never frowns ♪"
58:57;59:00;"♪ Soon I will be president ♪"
59:00;59:04;"- Man, this type of music, like,"
59:04;59:07;"you don't hear it around much these days."
59:07;59:09;"- No."
59:09;59:10;"- I'm actually curious about that."
59:10;59:12;"'Cause, like, remember when we were talking about GBV,"
59:12;59:13;"Gotta Buy Voices?"
59:13;59:14;"- Yeah."
59:14;59:17;"- I'm kinda asking if any listeners are, like, actual fans,"
59:17;59:18;"or if any of them saw them at Coachella."
59:18;59:19;"I'm just, like, curious."
59:19;59:21;"Anybody listen to Time Crisis?"
59:21;59:25;"Do you still regularly listen to the harder side"
59:25;59:28;"of alternative rock, punk, post-punk?"
59:28;59:29;"Are you jamming Fugazi?"
59:29;59:32;"It's very youthful music,"
59:32;59:34;"but the youth of today don't seem to be--"
59:34;59:35;"- It's old."
59:35;59:36;"- Yeah."
59:36;59:37;"- Are you doing Bad Brains?"
59:38;59:40;"Are you doing Black Flag?"
59:40;59:44;"- I wonder."
59:44;59:46;"- The kids are doing Nirvana and RHCP."
59:46;59:49;"- Yeah, I mean, that's everything."
59:49;59:51;"Did you put any Nirvana on the playlist?"
59:51;59:53;"- The last song is Nirvana, ""Breed."""
59:53;59:54;"- Okay."
59:54;59:56;"You don't wanna break 'em off"
59:56;59:57;"with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit?"""
59:57;59:58;"- No, man."
59:58;01:00:04;"(heavy metal music)"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"(heavy metal music)"
01:00:07;01:00:13;"- You just, like, bench press right now?"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"- This would be the part of the class, like,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"and now, double time!"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Push this (beep) out of that bag!"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"- That was almost like a drop."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"- Yeah."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"♪ I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care ♪"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"♪ I don't care, I don't care, I don't care ♪"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"- Power, people, give me power!"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"- We're almost there, guys."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"You're gonna feel so good after this."
01:00:35;01:00:38;"- Get you ready for the pool."
01:00:38;01:00:39;"- Man."
01:00:39;01:00:45;"What do you think Kurt would think about, like,"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Nirvana being in a kickbox?"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"I mean, I even wonder,"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"back when you were, like, a young Nirvana fan, as a teen,"
01:00:52;01:00:57;"do you think he would've found the idea of you, like,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"going to kickbox class on a Saturday morning funny?"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- Oh, yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I think it's funny now."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"(laughing)"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- Dude, speaking of funny."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"- Oh."
01:01:09;01:01:15;"- This, I just wanna say, like,"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"anybody who's under the age of, like, 25,"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"back in the '90s, like,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"you couldn't escape this kind of music."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"It's such a different atmosphere."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"- Yeah."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"- 'Cause even if you, like, were more into pop or hip hop,"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"this (beep) would just be on MTV, and, like,"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"I'm not dissing it, but I'm just like,"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"life has a different, like,"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"I'm definitely not saying for the better,"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"but life has a different flavor"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"when you're just, like, walking around,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"and you're just like, ""Downhill, round, round."""
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- Just heavy riffs."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"- Yeah."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"I guess it's kinda like how today"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"you can't go anywhere without hearing, like,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"trap music and trap hi-hats."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- Right."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Even if you don't know the song,"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"you just hear, like, the (imitates trap music)"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- Right."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"- And back in the '90s, like, ""Downhill."""
01:01:54;01:01:58;"This is, like, what it sounded like."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"I was so into this when I was 15, dude."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- This just makes me think of, like,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"walking home from school, and, like,"
01:02:04;01:02:05;"some kid wanna, like,"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"try and get me to smoke a cigarette."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Or, like, be in somebody's older brother's room."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Totally."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- That, like, smells really weird,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"and it's, like, a CD tower."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Oh, my God."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Well, that's a hell of a playlist, Jake."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"I encourage everybody to check it out, and--"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- This one might not be quite the hit, though,"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"the Home Depot one was."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"- Well, we'll see."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"I mean, so--"
01:02:22;01:02:22;"- I think it's a great playlist."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"I think, if you're working out in your garage or whatever,"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"going to the gym with earbuds,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"give it a shot, man."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"It's 43 minutes."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"- That's a great length for a workout."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"- Totally, dude."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"It's all up-tempo, it's real high-energy."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"And then you're gonna explore"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"the punk and post-punk underground"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"as it morphed into mainstream alternative music"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"in the early '90s."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"You're going from the early '80s"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"into the early '90s. - You're on a journey."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- Oh, yeah, it's a journey."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"It's not in chronological order."
01:02:51;01:02:55;"I start with mainstream label alternative music,"
01:02:55;01:02:58;"Soundgarden, and I end with Chili Peppers and Nirvana."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"But the whole middle part is all '80s."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"- Right."
01:03:03;01:03:03;"- Punk, post-punk. - So this playlist"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"is good for the body and the mind."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- Oh, yeah."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Very edifying."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Very edifying."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"- Try it out."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Or, like, you know, I bet we probably have a lot of listeners"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"who favor the harder side of rock,"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"who probably go to exercise classes,"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"and maybe they don't like hearing Chain Smokers"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"in the exercise class, but you know what?"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"That's fine."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Don't be a dick about it."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Just go up to your teacher and say,"
01:03:26;01:03:30;"""Sir, madam, is it okay if during this class"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"""I pop some earbuds in?"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"""I will be watching you visually and following along,"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"""but I will be listening to Jake's"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"""punk and post-punk workout playlist."""
01:03:40;01:03:42;"If the teacher says yes, pop those earbuds in"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"and do your thing."

01:04:45;01:04:47;"just search Time Crisis on Apple Music."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"You'll find all the Time Crisis playlists"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"and his will be prominently featured."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"All right, Jake, man, you ready for the top five?"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"- Oh yeah."
01:04:55;01:05:00;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:05:00;01:05:05;"- So this week, we're gonna be looking at the top five"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"songs of today, as always,"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"but we're gonna be comparing them"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"to the top five songs of 1967."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Why?"
01:05:13;01:05:18;"Because 2017 is the 50th anniversary of 1967."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"It's always like funny to talk about--"
01:05:21;01:05:22;"- Man."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- The anniversary of years."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- You know what's funny?"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"That Chili Peppers song--"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"- Yeah."
01:05:27;01:05:31;"- Is the halfway point between '67 and right now."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"'92 was 25 years ago."
01:05:34;01:05:37;"- Oh my God, that's a trip."
01:05:37;01:05:42;"1992 is the halfway point between our present and 1967."
01:05:42;01:05:48;"So that means all the cultural changes between '67 and '92,"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"which for us now, looking backwards,"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"seems like a fully different world."
01:05:54;01:05:54;"- Oh yeah."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"- When I think back to '92, I'm like,"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"all right, what's changed?"
01:05:58;01:06:03;"Maybe the reason the '60s had this false sense of promise."
01:06:03;01:06:03;"I mean a lot."
01:06:03;01:06:08;"Yeah, now we got Apple Watches, Instagram, Uber Eats."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"'92, I was still a little bit too young"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"to really have a zeitgeist consciousness."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"- I was 15, dude."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"- Okay, so you were old enough to have"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"a zeitgeist consciousness."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"- I loved the summer of '92."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"- Papa John's?"
01:06:20;01:06:23;"- No, I was working in the kitchen at a summer camp."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"- Okay, food service though."
01:06:24;01:06:27;"- Yeah, a lot of RHCP that summer."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"A lot of Pearl Jam, a lot of Soundgarden."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"- All right, well that's changed."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"- Yep."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"- '92, you had to walk around hearing guitars"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"and slap bass a lot."
01:06:35;01:06:38;"- But it's funny that like Sgt. Pepper"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"was only 25 years old at that point."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"It's so weird."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Now it's 50."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Wow, '92 was the midpoint."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"- Chili Peppers, the halfway point between"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Hendrix and the Beatles and the Chainsmokers."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"- That's wild, man."
01:06:52;01:06:55;"So we're talking about 1967 'cause, you know,"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"That's why they're out on touring."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Or not the Grateful Dead."
01:07:01;01:07:01;"- Dead & Co."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Dead & Co."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"It's also recently was the 50th anniversary"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"of Sgt. Pepper."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"- And the first Hendrix record, Are You Experienced?"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"- So people were talking about that a lot."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"50th anniversary, like what does it mean?"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"- Paul McCartney was recently in the last--"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- Oh yeah."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"- Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"- I saw that image of him like as an old pirate"
01:07:22;01:07:26;"and I thought it was like some funny like Photoshop joke."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"I can't believe he's actually in it."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"- Yeah."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- He's like, I'll take the time."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I'll get up at like 5 a.m."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"get hit the makeup chair."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"And spend three hours in makeup to like"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"go be in this movie."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- I mean, life is weird, man."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"You know, 50 years ago,"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"you're making one of the most influential albums"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"of all time."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"25 years later, you're just jamming some RHCP,"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"raising your children."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"Fast forward another 25,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"you're acting alongside Johnny Depp."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"Life is a strange journey."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"So--"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"- You're acting alongside a fairly old Johnny Depp."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"Twilight of his career."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- Oh man."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"- Yeah man, so Summer of Love, huh?"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- That was the Summer of Love."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"- I also thought it would be funny"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"in terms of, you know, '67 being the like,"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"the height of like the baby boomer"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"coming into their own as a generation"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"and like evoking all this change"
01:08:21;01:08:25;"and then the final culmination of the baby boomers in power."
01:08:25;01:08:28;"We end up with Trump in the office."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"- Yeah, that's--"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- Which is like the true disillusion."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"It's like a Don Henley song on steroids."
01:08:32;01:08:35;"It's like the baby boomer dream"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"is like fully rotten and like trashed."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"- Yeah, can you imagine that?"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"That you're like growing up with some conservative"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"greatest generation parents."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Right."
01:08:45;01:08:49;"- In a racist household and maybe you're like,"
01:08:49;01:08:53;"you turn 18 in like 1965."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Things are changing."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Civil rights movement,"
01:08:56;01:08:59;"the first truly like mass protest against a war"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"and maybe you really have this feeling like,"
01:09:02;01:09:05;"wow, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"and you're right at that age"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"where you just became an adult."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"You suddenly are pushing back against the government."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Imagine that that's the year you turned 18."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"Your introduction to adulthood"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"is when all these things are happening."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"That probably set up a precedent"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"where you're kind of believing,"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"wow, things can change very quickly."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"I remember when I was a kid,"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"we didn't have Jimi Hendrix or Bob Dylan"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"and now all these things changed"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"and then the rest of your life,"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"depending on where your mind's at,"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"this is like the harshest vibe version."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"So you start out on a high note at 18."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Things can change, dad."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Music can change, culture can change,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"the way we treat each other can change."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"We're entering a new era of consciousness."
01:09:45;01:09:48;"Then by the early 70s,"
01:09:48;01:09:51;"Nixon is president,"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Vietnam War is still kind of going on"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"and just like in this like petering out"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"in this kind of like brutal way."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"The hippie stuff ends."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"There's like a recession."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"Everybody starts wearing kind of like weird orange"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"and brown colors."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"- Just a general malaise, man."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"- Just a general malaise."
01:10:08;01:10:13;"Then the 80s, kind of the economy picks back up"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"but you got this like President Ronald Reagan"
01:10:15;01:10:19;"fighting like secret wars in Latin America."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Also at that point, culturally,"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"hippies are like a joke."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"The idea of still being a hippie in the 80s"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"outside of maybe at a Grateful Dead show"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"is kind of laughable."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"A lot of former hippies are now like becoming businessmen,"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"slicking their hair back."
01:10:34;01:10:37;"You got Donald Trump running real estate in New York."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"And then it's the 90s and you're kind of like,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"kind of your last hope is like Bill Clinton."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"- First boomer president."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"- Right, you're finally like, okay, okay, this is good."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"We're back on track."
01:10:46;01:10:50;"Bill Clinton, we're gonna overlook all like the gnarly stuff."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Not reading the fine print on the crime bill"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"but you're just trying to feel good."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"You're like 90s, things are back on track, man."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"It's the end of history."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"No more fighting with the Soviet Union."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Democracy won out."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Things are okay."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"- War is over."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"- Bill and Hillary in the White House, man."
01:11:08;01:11:12;"They're jamming Fleetwood Mac at their campaign events."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"This dude's playing saxophone."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"Okay, finally."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"You don't look at the fine print"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"because you don't wanna harsh your vibe,"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"but you're kind of like, nice."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"This is, yeah."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"- Although Jerry dies during Bill's first term."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"That's a tough break."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"- Jerry dies, but it's bittersweet"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"'cause you're like, man, Jerry's gone,"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"but we do finally have a boomer musician"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"in the White House, man."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"That's pretty cool."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"- It's not Neil Young, but it's pretty close."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- It's pretty close."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"I would have preferred a guitarist or a drummer,"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"but sax is pretty cool, man."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"And you have this feeling that,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"okay, maybe things are back on track."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"Back when I was 18 and the world was changing,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"yes, it would have seemed improbable"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"that we'd have a cool saxophone playing dude."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"And then the end of the 90s,"
01:11:54;01:11:58;"now this dude is fooling around with the intern."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"- 50 year history here."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"I love it."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"- It's just like brutal."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"- It ends with the Lewinsky, that's just rough."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"- Right, and it's rough."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"And the Republicans were being hypocrites about it,"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"but you don't feel like, it's just brutal."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"And then back at the Iraq War,"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"protests on the street again."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"- Another boomer president."
01:12:14;01:12:15;"- Can't stop it."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Now we got the other side of the boomer's got George Bush."
01:12:17;01:12:21;"Then Obama again, you're kind of like,"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"at this point, a little disillusioned,"
01:12:22;01:12:27;"but Obama is such a good guy breaking a racial barrier."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"So many things to feel good about."
01:12:29;01:12:32;"- And you're also like, this is the younger generation."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"He's not a boomer."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"You're like, he's like, okay, okay."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"- So now you're like, okay."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"Now you have this feeling,"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"okay, we didn't quite win this thing."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Our generation didn't quite win it,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"but you know what?"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"We taught our children well, man."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"And now we got an Obama."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"- Teach your children well."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"- And then of course,"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"just the brutal cycle of American history."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Obama is followed by Trump."
01:12:57;01:13:01;"And in some ways it's kind of like--"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"- The last gasp of the boomers."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"Unless Bernie wins in 2020."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"- Not gonna happen, man."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"It's brutal."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"- Never say never, but yeah."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"- Look, I think there's been so many positive developments,"
01:13:13;01:13:17;"but I understand why people get more and more nihilistic"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"as they get older,"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"because it kind of seems like for every gain"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"that we have in terms of human rights,"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"something else brutal happens,"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"where it's like you only get the human rights"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"in this kind of weird dehumanized capitalist package."
01:13:32;01:13:37;"So anyway, if you came of age in 1967,"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"you have been on quite a journey."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"- I remember when Obama won in '08"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"and calling my mom and she was like,"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"""Well, don't have your hopes up too high."""
01:13:45;01:13:46;"- Right."
01:13:46;01:13:49;"- She's like, ""I've been down this road before."""
01:13:49;01:13:50;"- Yeah."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"No, understandable."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"That's that real wisdom."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"- So, woo, '67."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"- I just wanna say something else."
01:13:55;01:13:56;"- Yeah."
01:13:56;01:13:57;"- You know what year I turned 18?"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"- 2002?"
01:14:00;01:14:04;"- 2002, so my expectations are very low."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"- Wow."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- Just like post 9/11, invading Iraq."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"- That's intense."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"- George Bush."
01:14:10;01:14:11;"That was my coming of age."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"- I turned 18 in '95, a real benign era."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"- Yeah, that's kind of a cool time to turn 18."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"- That's real mellow."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"- You entered adulthood with a cool sax playing president."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Okay, so what were people--"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"- Although Jerry was dead."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"- Right, that's harsh."
01:14:25;01:14:29;"Let's start with the number five song of 1967."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"This song's called ""The Happening."""
01:14:30;01:14:32;"- This week of '67."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"- This week of '67."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"- June '67."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"- June '67."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"So, the beginning of the summer of love."
01:14:37;01:14:41;"This was on the radio, getting bought up in the stores."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"""The Happening,"" I don't know this song."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"It's by the Supremes, who of course I know."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"But ""The Happening,"" that's a pretty cool '60s title."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"This is the theme to the Columbia Pictures film,"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"""The Happening."""
01:14:56;01:14:59;"- Yeah, that is the most '60s film title ever."

01:16:44;01:16:45;"You're Jake Paul."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"People love Paul McCartney, he's the cute bit,"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"you're Jake Paul."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"- What line of work am I in there?"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"- You're like a crooner."
01:16:55;01:16:55;"- Yeah."
01:16:55;01:17:01;"- So Jake Paul is a Vine star/actor who portrays Dirk"
01:17:01;01:17:05;"on the Disney Channel comedy series Bizaardvark."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"Sick name."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"- Bizaardvark?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"- Yeah man, you don't watch Bizaardvark?"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- I got every season on DVD, bro."

01:17:28;01:17:31;"individuals who teamed up together to take over Hollywood."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"Paul's a member of the squad."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"So this is kind of like a mission statement,"
01:17:35;01:17:39;"the same way that in 1967 you had a lot of young people"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"coming together to expand their consciousness with LSD"
01:17:42;01:17:47;"and marijuana and push back against the Vietnam War."
01:17:47;01:17:51;"These days you have Team 10 doing something similar."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"- They're taking over Hollywood."
01:17:53;01:17:58;"- Yeah, but I assume it's for the good, for the global good."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"- That's a solid mission statement."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"- But also, just in case you're, 'cause I can already see"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"the gears turning and you're like, oh Jake Paul,"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"he doesn't stand for anything."
01:18:08;01:18:12;"He's not brave like a Jimi Hendrix or something."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Well listen to this, man."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"- Okay, I'm gonna go in open-minded, bro."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"- Okay, good, 'cause listen to this."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"On January 5th, Jake Paul hid in the bathroom"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington,"
01:18:21;01:18:25;"D.C. after attending a social media event at the White House."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Paul was able to spend several hours hidden in the bathroom"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"before leaving in the early morning, unseen and unobserved."
01:18:30;01:18:33;"Paul filmed the entire stunt for his YouTube channel."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"The Secret Service tracked Paul down at his home in L.A."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"and deemed him a non-threat."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- How did he leave undetected?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"That seems insane."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- I mean, if you're just hanging in the bathroom"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"at the White House and then probably on your way,"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"I don't know, a lot of people come in and out"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"of the White House all the time."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"- Then you just walk out the front door"
01:18:48;01:18:49;"at six in the morning?"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"- Yeah. - Are there just security"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"guards at the front door being like,"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"sir, can I help you? - I don't know, man."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"I'm just saying, this guy's got cojones."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"- No, no, big time, that's crazy."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"- So anyway, this is his song."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"And look, this is a big deal, honestly."
01:19:02;01:19:05;"This is number five on the iTunes chart."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"- Very big deal."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"- I know it probably seems like he's got a leg up"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"being on Bizaardvark, but trust me,"

01:26:51;01:26:54;"It's a successful product in the marketplace man."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"Now this is funny."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Back to 1967."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"So the number five song on the charts that week was ""The Happening"" by The Supremes."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Yep."
01:27:02;01:27:09;"The number three song on the charts is called ""I Got Rhythm"" by The Happenings."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Wow."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Every year has its like word."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Clearly 1967 it was happening."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"It's happening man."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"It's happening."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"So The Happenings."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"God this top five sucks so far."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"What is this song?"
01:27:22;01:27:26;"Well this is a cover of, you know the song, it's a Gershwin song."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Oh my god, another old song."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Yeah."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"I've never heard this."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"It's all schmaltz, 1967."
01:27:48;01:27:50;"Yeah this sucks."
01:28:12;01:28:16;"This already must have been like a throwback in 1967."
01:28:16;01:28:22;"It's like a college like acapella group."
01:28:22;01:28:26;"1967 was not popping on the radio."
01:28:26;01:28:29;"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
01:28:31;01:28:35;"The number three song on the iTunes chart in 2017 is DJ Khaled."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Did we really listen to it?"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"I think we heard the song together."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Is this the one like on the one?"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Yeah exactly."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"We the best music."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"I know he the best music."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"DJ Khaled."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"It's the hit of the summer right guys?"
01:29:15;01:29:19;"Imagine them recording this in like November being like oh yeah dude."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Summer 2017 this will be it."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"This is it."
01:29:28;01:29:32;"Did an algorithm write this song to be the song of the summer?"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Perhaps."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"You know what like this is not a bad song."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"God this is the worst top five ever."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"On both sides?"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Yeah this is awful."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"67 and."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"It's just like."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Yeah no I'm glad you say that because sometimes."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"Sometimes when the top five is not popping or you know."
01:29:50;01:29:54;"It's always tough when people."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"I think about this a lot because there are a lot of elements of our modern culture."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Not this song."
01:29:58;01:30:03;"I mean this song is inoffensive but like because so many people hate on our modern culture."
01:30:03;01:30:06;"They come from this vantage point of like but back in the day it was good."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"And then people are like oh you're just like an old fogey."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Yeah yeah."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"When I really think about it."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"I don't think I'm quite an old fogey yet."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"But I'm definitely not young anymore."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"And I think when I see these conversations happen."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"And people are like 2017 sucks."
01:30:20;01:30:21;"1967 was good."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"And then people say no man."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"1967 was horrible."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Things are better now."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"And I just always want to say they're both horrible."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Basically it's always been horrible."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"I don't know you have to go back probably at least."
01:30:33;01:30:34;"Are we talking about music right now?"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"No the world."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"You're losing me here."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"No the world."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"67 put out some crucial records."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"They just weren't in the top five."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"No I'm just saying the world."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"I just think the world has always been bad."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Well jeez man."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"I think it's kind of a wash."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"I'm pessimistic lately."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"Well that's fair man."
01:30:51;01:30:52;"It's hilarious to me."
01:30:52;01:30:53;"This is the song of the summer this year."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"I know."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Cool."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"You know I have nothing against it."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"There's so many talented people on that song."
01:30:58;01:30:59;"Sure."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"And it's not a bad song."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"It just doesn't hit me the right way."
01:31:01;01:31:02;"It's like."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"I don't know."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Maybe if I was 14."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Maybe if Hillary won."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"You'd be feeling it."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Yeah maybe."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Maybe if Bernie won you'd be feeling it."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"I'm the one."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Oh whatever."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"Yep."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"That sums it up."
01:31:16;01:31:17;"Why do we even."
01:31:17;01:31:18;"You know what."
01:31:18;01:31:19;"F*** this show."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"Yeah why do we even listen to these songs man."
01:31:20;01:31:21;"Who cares."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"Everything sucks."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Time Crisis sucks."
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Everything does suck."
01:31:24;01:31:25;"Well hold on."
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Music."
01:31:26;01:31:27;"Time Crisis doesn't suck."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"It's a glimmer of hope in a cruel world."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"It's pretty good."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"No but I think."
01:31:31;01:31:32;"Time Crisis might suck."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"I'm not even trying to say Time Crisis doesn't suck."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"But as always on Time Crisis."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"One thing that we come back to is that the world is horrible."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"And it's not a good time."
01:31:40;01:31:45;"And it's not a good time."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Sometimes the top five is horrible."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"But it's a Sunday afternoon."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"And we're here."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"Just drinking some Modellos."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Talking."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"And you're at home listening."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Probably drinking a Modello too."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Hanging out."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"And that's what life is about."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"Is human interaction and communication."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"And whether you're talking directly to somebody."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Or you're listening to them on Apple Radio."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"Those are the two choices you have in life."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"But either way."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Whether times are good or bad."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Happy or sad."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"That's what it's about."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Cracking a brew."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"Driving to Home Depot with your stepdad."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Throwing on the Home Depot playlist."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"Bonding over that dire straits."
01:32:29;01:32:34;"That's a major breakthrough in a lot of people's relationship with their stepdad."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Is the first Home Depot trip."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"Yep."
01:32:36;01:32:39;"Jake, do you know that."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"I like Rod Stewart."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"You're not up on memes that much."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"No."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Good for you."
01:32:45;01:32:49;"You're not spending hours aimlessly looking at Instagram."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"But one of the memes now."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"Is, I don't even want to explain it that much."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"But the meme is essentially."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Cracking open a cold one with the boys."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Yep."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"That's the joke."
01:33:01;01:33:04;"It's taking that phrase and that concept."
01:33:04;01:33:08;"And doing various funny things with words and images."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"There's nothing funny about that."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"You don't know this is where the culture clash."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"The generational divide."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"I guess it depends what the visuals are right."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"It can be applied to any meme format."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"This is killer radio right now."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"Cracking open a cold one with the boys."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"But anyway, I just bring that up because you know what."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"Why do memes come at a certain time."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Sometimes because something happens in the news."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"Other times it's more mysterious."
01:33:31;01:33:35;"And perhaps memes tell us more about our cultural moment."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Than the songs do these days."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Because these songs are real."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"Our business as usual kind of just like."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Bragging."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"So far we've had two bragging about your own success."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"Classic American."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"And we had one about a crumbling relationship."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Classic human nature."
01:33:53;01:33:56;"But you know those are just standard American things."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"But the memes."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Cracking open a cold one with the boys."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"That makes sense to me."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"2017."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Really that seems utterly timeless to me."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"That's like a Springsteen song."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"No but I'm saying why would that come back as a meme now."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"Why in 2017."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"I don't know man."
01:34:09;01:34:12;"It's because the bonds of our society are weakening."
01:34:12;01:34:14;"People are alienated from one another."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"The country is at war with itself."
01:34:16;01:34:20;"We got a horrible man in the White House."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"We got people fighting on social media."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"Fighting in real life."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"We got violence."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"We got hateful people."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"There's something about that concept."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Of spending time with your friends."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"And drinking alcoholic beverage."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"That I think is like very human."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"Seems more precious now."
01:34:37;01:34:42;"Or seems more something to not take for granted or something."
01:34:42;01:34:47;"Yeah I think we've realized how precious a sense of community can be."
01:34:47;01:34:54;"Either that or people on the internet are just mean spirited dickheads just making fun of everything."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"That seems slightly more likely."
01:34:56;01:35:03;"Yeah and the tone is like so many layers of irony deep that you can't even parse it."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"You're probably right man."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Okay finally we have like a pretty classic song."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"Number two."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Number two of 67."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"We finally got a classic song."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Here we go."
01:35:10;01:35:13;"Okay."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"Aretha."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Yeah."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"You know Otis Redding wrote this song?"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"I didn't know that."
01:35:17;01:35:21;"But Aretha added some fun stuff."
01:35:21;01:35:25;"Otis Redding died in 67."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"I wonder if you ever got to hear this version."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"I don't know."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"He might have died in like June of 67."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Man."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Plane crash."
01:35:34;01:35:35;"Yeah."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"Died in December."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"So you heard it."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"Oh wow."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Me and Marvin Gaye never crossed over."
01:35:57;01:35:58;"About a week apart."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Did Sam Cooke die in 67 too?"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"64?"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Wow."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"Classic song."
01:36:11;01:36:12;"I mean okay."
01:36:12;01:36:16;"This is the first time you could say unabashedly it's a pop song with a simple message."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"But clearly would have a larger cultural resonance."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"Yeah."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"1967."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"The civil rights movement."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"You have so many things changing."
01:36:24;01:36:28;"The concept of respect very much in there."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Yeah applies to."
01:36:29;01:36:30;"Women's rights movement."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"Or she's singing to her man."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"Well I'm saying like."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"Already evokes larger sort of cultural currents."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Exactly."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"For sure."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"The song seems to be hers speaking to one person."
01:36:39;01:36:46;"But clearly the idea of demanding respect in an era where there are a lot of institutions not giving people respect."
01:36:46;01:36:49;"Now that is, I mean this is some classic in my neighborhood."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"In my neighborhood."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"The whole world's going crazy."
01:36:57;01:37:00;"But in my neighborhood we get about one thing."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Respect."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"The number two song."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"Some might even say the respect of our day."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"It's called believer."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"I could you know."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"I'm a believer."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"I couldn't leave her if I tried."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"No this is believer by Imagine Dragons."
01:37:19;01:37:24;"I had a conversation this weekend with somebody who kept calling them imagination dragons."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"I don't know I thought that was fun."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"That is good."
01:37:27;01:37:30;"And now at number two with believer."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Imagination Dragons."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"Hey."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"You like those drums?"
01:37:53;01:37:58;"By the way Jake this is the only successful rock band of our era."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"Is this rock?"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"You hear those."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I mean is it not rock?"
01:38:05;01:38:06;"Yeah I don't."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"It's pop."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"It's got the tasteful palette of rock and roll."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Drums, guitar."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"This is not rock right here."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"But that's a guitar."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Maybe an acoustic guitar."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"This is more like 21 Pilots."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"21 Pilots is rock."
01:38:20;01:38:21;"Hybrid."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"No but because they have rap."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"This is rock."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Not rock."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"I'm not even trying to be like a purist about it."
01:38:30;01:38:33;"I just, I would not classify this as rock."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Why you hear that kind of distorted guitar that came in?"
01:38:38;01:38:43;"Well I think they're like taking some of the like palette of rock."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Yeah."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"Off the color wheel."
01:38:45;01:38:48;"But I think this is just like hot music."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"Well as a rock fan do you like hearing."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"It's got a minor key though."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"It's like weird."
01:38:53;01:38:57;"Do you like hearing the tasteful palette of rock applied to a pop structure?"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Theoretically yes."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Not in this case."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Alright man."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"You in?"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"I'm a big Imagination Dragons fan."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Oh you're deep."
01:39:11;01:39:12;"How's the full length?"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"We call ourselves Imagineers."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"They've been big for a minute."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"This is their second album."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Okay I think you might like this."
01:39:18;01:39:20;"They're from Nevada."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Oh really?"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Yeah."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"They're British."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"No they even have some kind of."
01:39:24;01:39:25;"What town are they from?"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"I think they might be from Vegas."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Like they're kind of."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"I think they have some connection to the Killers."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"They're like a post-Killers Vegas band."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"They're coming out of Tonopah."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"Is that a town in Nevada?"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"Yeah."
01:39:36;01:39:38;"Western Nevada."
01:39:38;01:39:41;"But like surely you must like them a little more knowing that they're from Vegas."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"That's cool."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"Sure."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"I don't know."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"I mean the fact that they like."
01:39:46;01:39:48;"I know but it's not like they just formed in Vegas."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"These guys are like from Vegas."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"That's cool."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"I mean I don't feel one way or another about that."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"That doesn't move the needle for me."
01:39:56;01:39:57;"But come on."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Growing up in Vegas in the greater Vegas area."
01:39:59;01:40:01;"It seems like an interesting place to grow up."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Yes."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"But it doesn't make you."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"That doesn't give you more cred as a band."
01:40:05;01:40:08;"No but it's part of their journey and their story."
01:40:08;01:40:10;"That would be true of any place that they came from."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Okay."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"I got more for you."
01:40:13;01:40:16;"The lead singer and the drummer met at Brigham Young University."
01:40:16;01:40:19;"Now we're getting more interesting."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"So Mormons."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Current Mormons."
01:40:23;01:40:26;"Who knows that's their business but."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"You know like."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"I like a Utah based band."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"That's a little more interesting."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"Yeah."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Because then."
01:40:32;01:40:37;"Then they started playing a lot in Provo."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"And then they moved back to Vegas."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"I mean that's cool."
01:40:40;01:40:43;"Yeah a lot of Provo based shows."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"Yeah they've developed a following in Provo."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"That's the imagination dragon story."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"The number."
01:40:51;01:40:52;"This show is very edifying."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Yeah."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"The number one song."
01:40:56;01:40:59;"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Nah."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"That was a big song of the year."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"But the number one song."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"This is what was really big."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Not a lot of people were ready for Hendrix you know."
01:41:07;01:41:08;"Yeah."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"But like you had to be a pretty cool cat."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"You had to really know what's happening."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"To be in Hendrix."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"The number one song was the Young Rascals."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"Groovin."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"Oh great song."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Sound effects."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Perfect for time crisis."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Yeah."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"These guys are from Jersey."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"This time they're probably going to like it."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"So this was written by two members of the Young Rascals."
01:42:14;01:42:17;"Felix Cavalieri and Eddie Brigatti."
01:42:17;01:42:20;"Groovin was inspired by Cavalieri's then girlfriend."
01:42:20;01:42:25;"He said of her, ""I believe she was divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity."""
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Wow."
01:42:26;01:42:30;"Weird thing to say man."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Actually, it makes me."
01:42:32;01:42:38;"Do you think if you're somebody's girlfriend who is an artist and you said to them,"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"""Babe, I just wrote a song called Groovin."
01:42:40;01:42:45;"I have a feeling it could possibly go on to be a defining song in 1967 and a number one hit single."
01:42:45;01:42:48;"And I just want you to know, you inspired this song."""
01:42:48;01:42:49;"And she's like, ""Oh babe, that's nice."""
01:42:49;01:42:55;"And he said, ""Yes, in fact, I believe you were divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity."""
01:42:55;01:42:58;"Then you might be like, ""Hm, I want to break up."""
01:42:58;01:43:00;"It's got a little edge to it."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"That's so weird."
01:43:01;01:43:06;"Yeah, that starts to take on like cult leader."
01:43:06;01:43:11;"I mean, that's why a lot of people have a problem with the concept of the muse."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"On one level, you're inspiring somebody's art."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"That's kind of cool."
01:43:14;01:43:20;"But on another level, you're kind of making somebody else into a vessel for your own--"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Ego."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Ego, yeah."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"To go full circle."
01:43:24;01:43:28;"I think if somebody inspired a song, the appropriate thing to do would be like,"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"""You're great."
01:43:29;01:43:32;"In some ways, you helped inspire this song."
01:43:32;01:43:35;"Obviously, you are not a set of chord changes."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"And words, but you're so cool."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"I'm so thankful that I have you in my life."
01:43:41;01:43:44;"You're a special human rather than--"""
01:43:44;01:43:46;"You were divinely sent here."

01:43:51;01:43:54;"""--of getting the young rascals their first number one hit."""
01:43:54;01:43:58;"Also, it's so funny to be like, ""Babe."""
01:43:58;01:44:01;"The idea also just like that you're like--"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"That language, and that was the actual quote."
01:44:03;01:44:07;"""I believe she was divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity."""
01:44:07;01:44:10;"Maybe he was on acid or something, and he had a weird vision."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"But also to be like--"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"That's like a big sell."
01:44:14;01:44:19;"""Babe, you were divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity."""
01:44:19;01:44:20;"And it's like, ""Oh, my God."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"What did you write?"""
01:44:21;01:44:22;"No pressure."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"A symphony?"
01:44:23;01:44:26;"Did you write some epic song, seven-minute song?"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Song cycle."
01:44:27;01:44:31;"Yeah, did you write ""Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,"" like a tribute to me"
01:44:31;01:44:36;"and saying how like who among them could even step to you?"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"Is that what the song about?"
01:44:37;01:44:41;"He's like, ""No, it's called 'Groovin'."""
01:44:41;01:44:43;"You know, because--"
01:44:43;01:44:47;"You know like when you come over on Sunday afternoon,"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"we have sex at my parents' house?"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"That's pretty groovy, right?"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"It's just chill."
01:44:54;01:44:57;"Makes me feel good."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"You were divinely sent here."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Couldn't get away too soon."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"You and me just endlessly groovin'."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"We're just groovin'."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Endlessly groovin'."
01:45:08;01:45:11;"I can't imagine anything that's better."
01:45:11;01:45:15;"The world is ours whenever we're together."
01:45:15;01:45:20;"There ain't a place I like to be instead of groovin'."
01:45:20;01:45:23;"I guess at least he's saying there's nowhere I'd rather be than with you."
01:45:23;01:45:28;"Down a crowded avenue."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"You gotta be careful with the concept of a supreme being"
01:45:30;01:45:35;"because it kind of takes away agency from the other humans in your life."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"You're not even saying, ""Thank you, baby."""
01:45:37;01:45:41;"You're saying, ""Thank you to the Lord our God for creating you for me."""
01:45:41;01:45:45;"That's just a funny idea of like attributing divine inspiration"
01:45:45;01:45:48;"to like the most banal things."
01:45:48;01:45:55;"Like, ""Hey, I just invented this new beverage."""

01:46:11;01:46:12;"Well, that's the classic--"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"I mean, it's kind of--"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"Groovin' is like a great song, but it is kind of the Slurpee of like--"
01:46:16;01:46:19;"Well, yeah, it's like the classic thing like when you win the Super Bowl"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"and it's like, ""I want to thank God."""

01:49:10;01:49:12;"I like to define inspiration of ""Groovin'."""
01:49:12;01:49:14;"Just 'cause of that tasteful palate?"
01:49:14;01:49:17;"I didn't have much on there for '17."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"What about you, man?"
01:49:18;01:49:22;"""Despacito"" is the only one of the top five that I'll admit is really, like--"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"I really, like, feel."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"I was very happy we got to learn about Jake Paul and Team 10"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"in a song, ""It's Every Day, Bro."""
01:49:29;01:49:33;"And I always think it's cool to see people disrupting the music industry."
01:49:33;01:49:36;"'Cause back in the day, you didn't hear about YouTubers"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"getting up there on the iTunes charts."
01:49:39;01:49:42;"So, you know, shout-out to him for that disruption."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"But I don't know if I love the song."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"I think they're both bad."
01:49:47;01:49:52;"I think comparing them has given me a pessimistic view of world history."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"You know who won? Rusty Cage."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Of Soundgarden?"
01:49:55;01:49:56;"Yeah."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Maybe that's a good note to end on,"
01:49:58;01:50:02;"'cause we didn't get to talk about Chris Cornell last week."
01:50:02;01:50:06;"So, Jake, we had a few music industry deaths recently,"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"the most recent of which was Greg Allman."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Yeah."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"I know you're a fan because at your birthday,"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"your last birthday,"
01:50:13;01:50:16;"you and members of your Grateful Dead cover band, Dick Picks,"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"got together to do some covers."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"I sang ""Eagle Song"" with you guys."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"Yeah, that was great."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"And as I recall, you guys did an Allman Brothers song."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Yeah, we did ""Blue Sky,"" which was written by Dickie Betts,"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"but, you know, classic Allman Brothers song."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"Greg played on it."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"So you're an Allman Brothers fan."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"For people who don't know, they're kind of like the Grateful Dead."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"They're just more Southern."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"Yeah, in the sense that they were like--"
01:50:41;01:50:42;"They would jam."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"Yeah, fully improvised."
01:50:44;01:50:47;"For people interested, check out ""Mountain Jam"""
01:50:47;01:50:49;"on the Eat a Peach album."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"It's like a 25-minute jam."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"It's beautiful."
01:50:53;01:50:58;"And they would write songs that would draw from jazz, blues, country,"
01:50:58;01:51:04;"kind of how the dead would take all the classic American forms of music"
01:51:04;01:51:08;"and then, like, cobble them together to make their own sound."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"The Allmans did that, too, just with a different aesthetic."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"Instead of California hippie, it was like Southern hippie."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Right."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I love the Allman Brothers."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"Yeah, beautiful."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"So what's a good song to play as a tribute to Greg?"
01:51:21;01:51:22;"How about ""Melissa""?"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"He wrote that one."
01:51:23;01:51:24;"Beautiful song."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"All right, great call."
01:51:25;01:51:29;"Let's go out with Allman Brothers, Melissa, RIP Greg Allman,"
