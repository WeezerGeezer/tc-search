00:07;00:15;"explain to us the phenomenon known as Shaggy Sting or Sting Shaggy. We'll also"
00:15;00:23;"read some spicy listener emails and dig in to an incredible top five featuring"
00:23;00:32;"music of 1972 and today this is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;"Be Spoken. One."
00:34;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"We were only there."
01:17;01:22;"Time Crisis back at it again. What's up Jake? Hey, how are you? Not bad."
01:22;01:27;"I enjoyed the past week of rainy gloomy weather in LA. I found it very refreshing."
01:27;01:31;"Yeah, I love it. There was a snowstorm in New York though, I was jealous of that."
01:31;01:35;"Really? Jealous? Yeah man, you're from the East Coast too."
01:35;01:39;"You never just dream about a snowy day? I don't romanticize that at all."
01:39;01:43;"I was talking about that with some people the other day, some California people who were like,"
01:43;01:47;"""Yeah, if you ever went back you would be like, 'Oh my God, how did I do this?'"""
01:47;01:52;"I even remember growing up and being in middle school and there'd be some kids who'd be like,"
01:52;01:57;"""Oh my God, I hate winter. Can't wait till my family goes on a cruise in the Bahamas."""
01:57;02:02;"Right. And I would just always be like, ""I mean, it is what it is, man."""
02:02;02:07;"Of course, spring is a beautiful season, April, the flowers bloom and shit,"
02:07;02:12;"but I just never related to that visceral hatred of winter. Did you hate it?"
02:12;02:19;"No. As a kid, I was into it. And then I lived on the West Coast pretty much my entire adult life,"
02:19;02:24;"except for two years in New York, 2010 and 2011. I remember those years."
02:24;02:30;"And I moved from Oakland, California to New York. And I remember thinking to myself,"
02:30;02:33;"""I don't remember winter being this traumatic when I was a kid."""
02:33;02:36;"Well, I guess in New York you're out on the street more. You get those wind tunnels."
02:36;02:42;"Oh, the wind tunnels. I think I just got ruined living in California for so many years."
02:42;02:43;"I just don't pine for it."
02:43;02:45;"Who knows? Maybe one day you'll be back there."
02:45;02:47;"Oh, I'll visit."
02:47;02:48;"Connecticut."
02:48;02:51;"Oh, to live? That would be weird. Not happening."
02:51;02:56;"I don't know anyone in Connecticut anymore. My parents don't live there anymore."
02:56;03:00;"My high school friends that I'm still in touch with, all three of them don't live in CT."
03:00;03:01;"Really?"
03:01;03:04;"Apparently my town was super Trumped out."
03:04;03:05;"Oh, really?"
03:05;03:07;"Even though Connecticut is super blue."
03:07;03:08;"Your town was Trump country?"
03:08;03:10;"My town was always kind of Republican."
03:10;03:13;"Do you think Lonnie's dad voted for Trump?"
03:13;03:14;"Oh, hell, big time."
03:14;03:17;"Trump's going to make them have McRibs year round."
03:17;03:23;"For lower level TC heads, Lonnie's dad was the dad of Lonnie, a childhood friend of Jake,"
03:23;03:30;"who had two fridges and one of them was exclusively dedicated to McRibs because he wanted to enjoy McRibs year round."
03:30;03:33;"So he would scoop up a lot of McRibs, freeze them."
03:33;03:36;"He needed that access 24/7, 65."
03:36;03:37;"Yeah."
03:37;03:39;"Wait, do they have McRibs year round?"
03:39;03:40;"No, I think it's a thing that-"
03:40;03:41;"It's still a special thing?"
03:41;03:43;"You know, I don't think it's even every year."
03:43;03:44;"Really?"
03:44;03:49;"I want to say every like, don't quote me on this, but I feel like it's every couple years."
03:49;03:51;"It's like the McRib is back."
03:51;03:56;"You know, it's like it's been gone for 18 months or it's been gone for two years."
03:56;03:57;"The McRib is back."
03:57;04:03;"We got a lot of good emails after our show about where we talked about people who had two fridges."
04:03;04:05;"I think one person said we actually had three fridges."
04:05;04:06;"Right."
04:06;04:09;"People were just kind of updating us, just letting us know."
04:09;04:11;"We live in a very divided country."
04:11;04:14;"Some people barely struggle to have one fridge."
04:14;04:18;"Then the millionaires and the billionaires got two, three, four, five fridges."
04:19;04:24;"We'll make a living, darling, down the road"
04:24;04:33;"'Cause I got you holding on to see where it goes"
04:33;04:40;"So don't you feel lonely?"
04:40;04:44;"I want you to know I can take you there"
04:46;04:49;"I want to drive around"
04:49;04:54;"With you with the windows down"
04:54;04:59;"And we can ride all night"
04:59;05:03;"Jake and I saw a rock show last week."
05:03;05:05;"That's right, man. Fun time."
05:05;05:08;"We saw Jack White at the Mine Theater. He just released an album."
05:08;05:10;"Friday. It's out now."
05:10;05:12;"So we went. It was a proper rock show."
05:12;05:17;"I wanted to tell you, after we said our goodbyes, and I got an Uber to go home,"
05:17;05:20;"the dude picked me up. He was a chill dude."
05:20;05:23;"23-year-old male from San Bernardino."
05:23;05:24;"Strong."
05:24;05:26;"He's about to move to Houston."
05:26;05:27;"He just got right into it."
05:27;05:28;"Wow, man."
05:28;05:30;"He's like, ""You from LA?"""
05:30;05:33;"I was like, ""Oh, no. Yeah, I'm from San Bernardino, man."
05:33;05:35;"I'm about to move to Houston, though."
05:35;05:37;"It's real cheap out there. I'm going to buy a house."""
05:37;05:39;"I was like, ""All right. That sounds like a plan."""
05:39;05:41;"And then he started talking music, and he's like,"
05:41;05:43;"""So what were you doing downtown?"""
05:43;05:45;"I said, ""I was going to a concert."""
05:45;05:47;"""What was the concert?"" ""Jack White."""
05:47;05:49;"The way he set this up was so weird."
05:49;05:51;"I was just thrown for a loop. ""Oh, Jack White."""
05:51;05:52;"He's driving all the time."
05:52;05:55;"He goes, ""Oh, man. I did a remix for Jack White."""
05:55;05:57;"I'm like, ""Yeah?"" He's like, ""Well, not officially for him,"
05:57;06:02;"but I mess around with music, and I did kind of a cover remix of one of his songs."
06:02;06:04;"You know his song, 'Seven Nation Army'?"""
06:04;06:05;"Never heard it."
06:05;06:07;"I was like, ""Yeah, man."""
06:07;06:09;"He closed the show with it, and he's like, ""Oh, I bet he did."
06:09;06:10;"That's a big one."""
06:10;06:12;"He's like, ""Well, anyway, yeah, I did kind of a cover remix."""
06:12;06:14;"""Hold on a second. I'll play it for you."""
06:14;06:17;"Literally, this is verbatim. ""Hold on a second. I'll play it for you."""
06:17;06:20;"I'm sitting in the back. He's driving on the highway,"
06:20;06:24;"and I'm waiting for him to pick up his phone to play me the remix."
06:24;06:25;"Then he totally throws me for a loop."
06:25;06:28;"I got to just pop home for a sec, get the CDR."
06:28;06:29;"Pop it in the--"
06:29;06:32;"It wasn't quite that crazy, but he goes, ""Hold on. Just give me a second."
06:32;06:33;"I'm going to play it for you."""
06:33;06:35;"He kept using the word ""play it for you."""
06:35;06:37;"I was like, ""All right."" He's like, ""Okay. You ready?"""
06:37;06:39;"At this time, he had his hands on the wheel the whole time."
06:39;06:40;"I didn't see him touch his phone."
06:40;06:41;"He goes, ""All right."""
06:41;06:50;"[beatboxing]"
06:50;06:57;"He does this minute-long beatbox version that had a dubstep breakdown."
06:57;06:59;"We're on the highway, so it's really noisy."
06:59;07:00;"I could just hear--"
07:00;07:01;"[beatboxing]"
07:01;07:03;"Was he smiling, or was he just stone-faced?"
07:03;07:05;"He was kind of stone-faced."
07:05;07:08;"He was a cool guy. I liked him, but I was just so thrown for a loop,"
07:08;07:11;"because he didn't say, ""Oh, you know, I beatbox."""
07:11;07:14;"He truly said to me, ""I did a remix for Jack White."""
07:14;07:16;"Well, really, it's a cover remix."
07:16;07:18;"I was like, ""Okay. I can't wait to hear this."""
07:18;07:19;"Then--"
07:19;07:22;"[beatboxing]"
07:22;07:23;"Then there was this dubstep part where it's like--"
07:23;07:27;"[beatboxing]"
07:27;07:29;"He did it for about a minute, and then he just kind of ended up--"
07:29;07:31;"[beatboxing]"
07:31;07:32;"He's just still driving."
07:32;07:34;"I was like, ""That's cool."""
07:34;07:36;"Then he got a tiny bit funny about it."
07:36;07:38;"He was like, ""Yeah, I don't know."
07:38;07:41;"""You were talking about Jack White, so I wanted to play it for you."""
07:41;07:42;"He kept using this language."
07:42;07:43;"Play it."
07:43;07:45;"He kept using the language of a recording, which confused me."
07:45;07:47;"I was like, ""No, that's cool. You're actually really good, man."""
07:47;07:51;"He's like, ""Oh, thanks. Yeah, you just saw Jack White,"
07:51;07:52;"""and I had this thing."""
07:52;07:53;"I was like, ""Yeah."""
07:53;07:56;"Then a real deep silence descended on the car"
07:56;07:59;"for the last 20 minutes of the drive."
07:59;08:00;"Yeah, kind of."
08:00;08:01;"Oh, man."
08:01;08:04;"No, I mean, then he was a chatty dude, so he--"
08:04;08:07;"Do you think he knew who you were? Your band?"
08:07;08:09;"He 100% did not know who I was,"
08:09;08:13;"because when I got in the car, he said, ""Ezra?"""
08:13;08:15;"I said, ""Yeah."""
08:15;08:17;"He goes, ""That's a great name, man."""
08:17;08:18;"I was like, ""Thanks."""
08:18;08:20;"He goes, ""You know the show Pretty Little Liars?"""
08:20;08:22;"Which is a TV show or was a TV show."
08:22;08:23;"I was like, ""Yeah, I've heard about it,"""
08:23;08:25;"because one of the main characters is named Ezra."
08:25;08:27;"He's like, ""Oh, yeah, there's a character Ezra Fitz."
08:27;08:28;"""Yeah, I like that show."""
08:28;08:30;"He goes, ""I never met Ezra in real life, though."
08:30;08:32;"""I didn't even know if it was a real name or not."""
08:32;08:34;"I was like, ""Oh, it's a real name."""
08:34;08:35;"He's like, ""Cool."""
08:35;08:37;"You didn't know if it was a real name?"
08:37;08:39;"He was a cool guy."
08:39;08:41;"Wow, man. That's hilarious, dude."

09:48;09:50;"Dude, isn't it amazing?"
09:50;09:53;"I keep wanting to say ""Seven Marry Three."""
09:53;09:55;"""Seven Nation Army."""
09:55;09:56;"Is that the name of the song?"
09:56;09:59;"Yes. ""Seven Marry Three"" was a '90s band."
09:59;10:00;"Yeah, ""Seven Nation Army."""
10:00;10:04;"Isn't it amazing how it's become an anthem of sports arenas?"
10:04;10:05;"Oh, yeah."
10:05;10:07;"It's so unpredictable,"
10:07;10:10;"sort of what will organically take on that role."
10:10;10:12;"Yeah, I mean, people look back--"
10:12;10:15;"You know what I mean? He's really been righted with that sort of intention."
10:15;10:18;"I mean, yeah, it's not even on some ""We Are The Champions."""

10:25;10:29;"People also don't stop and think that ""Seven Nation Army"" is such a weird phrase."
10:29;10:30;"What does that mean?"
10:30;10:33;"I guess it could be like World War II or something,"
10:33;10:37;"but ""Seven Nation Army"" also to me sounds like biblical."
10:37;10:38;"You know what I mean?"
10:38;10:39;"Or like classical."
10:39;10:40;"Yeah."
10:40;10:43;"Like the Spartans were powerless against the Seven Nation Army."
10:43;10:45;"It was Commandeer of the Seven Nations."
10:45;10:50;"Alexander the Great united the Hittites, the Phoenicians, and the Spartans,"
10:50;10:54;"forming a Seven Nation Army that marched on the barbarians."
10:54;10:55;"You know, something like that."
10:55;10:57;"That song is cool."
10:57;10:59;"Truly nothing to do with sports."
10:59;11:02;"[imitates drumming]"
11:02;11:05;"But it really has replaced--"
11:05;11:08;"It's replaced ""Rock and Roll Part II."""
11:08;11:09;"Gary Glitter?"
11:09;11:11;"What's the backstory on that?"
11:11;11:12;"Why that song?"
11:12;11:14;"What year is ""Rock and Roll Part II""?"
11:14;11:16;"'74?"
11:16;11:18;"Early '70s."
11:18;11:20;"Is this like a glam artist?"
11:20;11:21;"Yeah."
11:30;11:34;"I remember just going to so many hockey games in Hartford,"
11:34;11:38;"Hartford Wheelers, growing up."
11:38;11:40;"I was in this band in college called the Buff Guys,"
11:40;11:42;"and we'd open up all our shows with a cover."
11:42;11:43;"Of this?"
11:43;11:47;"We opened up--no, a different cover every show."
11:47;11:49;"One show we opened up with this."
11:49;11:51;"[imitates drumming]"
11:51;11:54;"This song just kind of takes a long time to get to the sports part."
12:04;12:06;"It's pretty limp."
12:06;12:10;"I think they did other versions that were maybe the souped-up version."
12:10;12:12;"It doesn't have the immediacy of--"
12:12;12:15;"[imitates drumming]"
12:15;12:18;"I think the backstory is that it was--"
12:18;12:22;"that became this unofficial chant at one team in Italy,"
12:22;12:24;"and then it was in a specific World Cup."
12:24;12:27;"It kind of crossed over on the global stage."
12:27;12:28;"The Gary Glitter or the White Stripes?"
12:28;12:29;"No, the White Stripes."
12:29;12:31;"I hate this."
12:31;12:35;"Out at Fenway Park, they play ""Sweet Caroline"" by Neil Diamond every time."
12:35;12:37;"Yeah, what's there to hate about that?"
12:37;12:38;"Here's what I hate about it."
12:38;12:41;"They added this, ""So good, so good."""
12:41;12:43;"They added their own Boston version."
12:43;12:47;"It's like, ""Sweet Caroline, good times never were so good."
12:47;12:49;"So good, so good."""
12:49;12:51;"Oh, that's where that comes from?"
12:51;12:52;"Yeah, yeah, the crowd."

12:54;12:56;"Also, sometimes when you sing it at karaoke,"
12:56;12:59;"just people at the karaoke place will do, ""So good, so good."""
12:59;13:02;"I didn't know that that specifically came from Fenway Park."
13:02;13:03;"Yeah, man."
13:03;13:06;"But what's the connection to ""Sweet Caroline"" in Boston anyway?"
13:06;13:08;"Someone's listening to the show right now and being like--"
13:08;13:10;"screaming at their radio that they know."
13:10;13:11;"Their radio."
13:11;13:12;"Caroline O'Reilly?"
13:12;13:13;"Screaming at their laptop."
13:13;13:17;"Was a well-known beer vendor at Fenway."
13:17;13:19;"She worked there for 45 years."

13:38;13:41;"'03, '04, they were down three games to none of the Yankees"

15:14;15:19;"He was like, ""I took my annual trip to Arizona every spring"
15:19;15:21;"to watch the Dodgers do spring training."""
15:21;15:22;"And what are you watching?"
15:22;15:24;"You're watching them run suicides?"
15:24;15:26;"No, no, they're doing scrimmage games."
15:26;15:27;"You're just in the gym?"
15:27;15:33;"Yes, you're probably watching some dudes stretching and doing wind sprints and stuff."
15:33;15:38;"If you pay extra, you can actually go in the gym and just watch the guy in the treadmill."
15:38;15:39;"Watch them in the showers."
15:39;15:41;"Oh, God."
15:41;15:44;"Okay, so you're watching games, perhaps?"
15:44;15:45;"Yeah, yeah, scrimmage games."
15:45;15:47;"You're just a baseball head."
15:47;15:49;"Vampire Weekends and spring training, maybe."
15:49;15:51;"Start some Vampire Weekends scrimmage shows?"
15:51;15:55;"The Black Diamond VIP package starts at $2,500 a head."
15:55;15:57;"You're going to be in the locker room."
15:57;15:59;"You get a front row seat to practice."
15:59;16:04;"You're going to be drinking chamomile tea with the band before the show."
16:04;16:09;"You are permitted one tequila shot post-show, although we will take your phone."
16:09;16:10;"We will take your phone."
16:10;16:12;"The phone will be locked."
16:12;16:14;"That was another thing at the show last night."
16:14;16:16;"Oh, you can eat chicken tenders."
16:16;16:17;"At the show last week?"
16:17;16:21;"Yeah, at the show last week, the Jack White show, all the phones were locked."
16:21;16:23;"Jack White says, ""Lock up your phones."""
16:23;16:25;"Pretty dope move, I thought."
16:25;16:30;"It's pretty intense for 1,500 people or whatever the capacity of the Mayan theater was."
16:30;16:32;"To lock up their phones."
16:32;16:33;"I'm with it."
16:33;16:36;"I don't think I would ever do it at a Vampire Weekend show or ask people to do it."
16:36;16:39;"It's not very in the ethos of Vampire."
16:39;16:41;"It is in the ethos of Jack White, though."
16:41;16:45;"If you're a Jack White fan, you're there to rock out."
16:45;16:50;"I think people get stressed out, naturally, when their phone is locked up."
16:50;16:53;"You could always go check in the lobby if you want to."
16:53;16:59;"Also, every time I've been to some weird party or event or show where they made you lock up your phone,"
16:59;17:02;"after a few minutes, you look around, nobody's on their phone."
17:02;17:03;"You do chill out a bit."
17:03;17:05;"It's like 1997 again, man."
17:05;17:06;"Yeah."
17:06;17:07;"Good old days."
17:07;17:08;"You just relax a little bit."
17:08;17:09;"Nothing wrong with that."
17:09;17:12;"Speaking of Jack White, again, I heard that there's a great interview with him."
17:12;17:14;"Oh, coming up right after our show?"
17:14;17:16;"Yeah, he went on Lars Ulrich's show."
17:16;17:19;"Every Sunday, you got Time Crisis."
17:19;17:21;"12 to 2, West Coast time."
17:21;17:24;"And then you have one hour chill out."
17:24;17:25;"Palate cleanse."
17:25;17:26;"Palate cleanser playlist show."
17:26;17:28;"And then you got Lars Ulrich on the mic."
17:28;17:31;"He's doing a tight hour interview with Jack White."
17:31;17:32;"Interesting."
17:32;17:35;"So, yeah, stick around one hour after Time Crisis."
17:35;17:37;"You can listen to Lars and Jack chop it up."
18:29;18:36;"So the mailbag has been overflowing since we started the 8-minute Cape Cod at gmail.com email list."
18:36;18:39;"We got one from Emily Allen Worrell."
18:39;18:41;"And I think we need to address this one."
18:41;18:42;"Okay."
18:42;18:44;"Because we got called out, Jake."
18:44;18:45;"Did we?"
18:45;18:46;"A little bit."
18:46;18:47;"Gently."
18:47;18:48;"I like the email."
18:48;18:49;"It's a great email."
18:49;18:52;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
18:52;18:57;"Dearest TC crew, I want to start by saying my husband and I are huge TC heads, and we love the show."
18:57;18:59;"I love TC couples."
18:59;19:02;"Yeah, just like a couple snuggling up on the couch."
19:02;19:03;"Yeah."
19:03;19:04;"Sunday afternoon."
19:04;19:05;"Working out in the yard."
19:05;19:06;"Babe, come in."
19:06;19:07;"TC time."
19:07;19:09;"I got the Doritos ready."
19:09;19:12;"Maybe when TC comes on, they just jump in the truck and just drive."
19:12;19:13;"Oh, yeah, dude."
19:13;19:14;"Sunday drive?"
19:14;19:15;"Sunday drive."
19:15;19:16;"Okay."
19:16;19:18;"But I've got a bone to pick."
19:18;19:19;"Uh-oh."
19:19;19:24;"You have often referenced the Sooner State, the great state of Oklahoma, but not always in the best light."
19:24;19:28;"Now, I understand we are a quintessential flyover country, but we have a lot of great music history."
19:28;19:32;"I thought it was funny when you referenced music that would be played in a Tulsa Marriott."
19:32;19:33;"Astute obso."
19:33;19:39;"But the assumption that Jason Aldean was from Broken Arrow made me think TC might need an oaky music history lesson."
19:39;19:43;"Okay, well, first of all, we got nothing against the great state of Oklahoma."
19:43;19:44;"Hell no."
19:44;19:48;"I remember we guessed that maybe Jason Aldean was from Oklahoma, but that was just because he's a country musician."
19:48;19:49;"Have you played there?"
19:49;19:50;"Oh, yeah."
19:50;19:51;"Norman?"
19:51;19:53;"We played in Norman and Tulsa."
19:53;19:54;"I've never been to Oklahoma."
19:54;19:55;"Really?"
19:55;19:56;"I need to go."
19:56;19:57;"You got to go, man."
19:57;19:58;"Check it out."
19:58;20:00;"I don't know how often we talk about Oklahoma, but--"
20:00;20:02;"I think it's like shorthand for like--"
20:02;20:03;"Random?"
20:03;20:06;"Random part of America, like Ohio or Oklahoma."
20:06;20:07;"It's shorthand."
20:07;20:09;"If you live there, it's not random."
20:09;20:10;"That's right."
20:10;20:11;"LA's random."
20:11;20:12;"Connecticut's random."
20:12;20:14;"CT is very random."
20:14;20:23;"Actually, quick aside, I feel like Connecticut has the least amount of credibility in terms of reputation of any state in the union."
20:23;20:25;"It's like Delaware, kind of."
20:25;20:29;"Right, but Delaware at least has, going forward, its tiny size."
20:29;20:31;"That's at least sort of interesting."
20:31;20:35;"Right, like Rhode Island is more interesting than Connecticut because at least it's small."
20:35;20:36;"And it has--"
20:36;20:37;"It's got a weirder name."
20:37;20:41;"Yeah, and it has those weird like Gilded Age mansions that are there."
20:41;20:44;"And Providence is a cool city, straight up."
20:44;20:46;"Yeah, Connecticut has no cool cities."
20:46;20:47;"It doesn't."
20:47;20:52;"And like the reputation of Connecticut is that it's like rich, eye-banker, preppy weirdos."
20:52;20:53;"Right."
20:53;20:56;"Which is true of the southwest corner, Fairfield County."
20:56;20:58;"Yeah, those are the people in Greenwich who commute into New York."
20:58;20:59;"Yeah, Greenwich, Stanford."
20:59;21:00;"New Canaan."
21:00;21:03;"But the rest of the state is like really pretty similar to like Jersey, for instance."
21:03;21:04;"Right."
21:04;21:06;"It's the sort of suburbs, working class."
21:06;21:13;"Jersey is, in the cultural imagination, so much sh*tter than Connecticut that actually it's an asset."
21:13;21:14;"Right, right."
21:14;21:15;"You know what I mean?"
21:15;21:16;"Yeah, you got New York."
21:16;21:17;"Because Jersey is not rando."
21:17;21:24;"Jersey, like to some people, epitomizes like trashiness and like the ""Joy-Z"" accent and the, you know, the toxic waste."
21:24;21:25;"Jersey short."
21:25;21:28;"So at least Jersey has like character."
21:28;21:33;"And then we also do have Gravitas, you know, with the Springsteen and Sopranos and stuff."
21:33;21:35;"But there's not going to be Connecticut Sopranos."
21:35;21:38;"No, there's not going to be a Connecticut Shore."
21:38;21:39;"Yeah."
21:39;21:40;"I mean, if there was, it would be like-"
21:40;21:42;"Even though there is beautiful coastline."
21:42;21:43;"You know what I'm saying?"
21:43;21:46;"There's like the Jersey Shore, which is like the trashy representation of Jersey."
21:46;21:48;"You're not going to have that for Connecticut."
21:48;21:50;"It's not going to ring true, even though it's there."
21:50;21:51;"Connecticut's a whatever state."
21:51;21:53;"Oklahoma has more flavor than Connecticut."
21:53;21:54;"Oh, big time."
21:54;21:55;"I mean, it's the Oakeys."
21:55;21:56;"Right."
21:56;21:57;"It's the Dust Bowl."
21:57;21:58;"Oklahoma has some real history."
21:58;21:59;"Well, and anyway, I'm-"
21:59;22:00;"I'm just saying, Connecticut's the lamest state."
22:00;22:01;"Well, actually, I think-"
22:01;22:04;"I feel embarrassed when I tell people I'm from CT."
22:04;22:05;"Yeah."
22:05;22:07;"I usually go, ""Um, East Coast."""
22:07;22:08;"And you were born in CT, too."
22:08;22:09;"Yeah."
22:09;22:11;"I'm glad I'm from Jersey."
22:11;22:12;"It's really legit, man."
22:12;22:13;"Jersey's legit."
22:13;22:15;"Imagine if your band was from CT."
22:15;22:16;"Oh, yeah, it'd be a wrap."
22:16;22:18;"It's tough to get off the ground if your band's from CT."
22:18;22:19;"Yeah, nah."
22:19;22:21;"Mayor got off the ground."
22:21;22:25;"Mayor and Rivers Cuomo, but they're not out there repping it."
22:25;22:28;"Where I come from isn't all that great"
22:28;22:31;"My automobile is a piece of crap"
22:31;22:33;"My fashion sense is a little wack"
22:33;22:36;"And my friends are just as greedy as me"
22:36;22:39;"I didn't go to bull in schools"
22:39;22:42;"Creepy girls never looked at me"
22:42;22:43;"Why should they?"
22:43;22:46;"I ain't nobody, got nothing in my pocket"
22:46;22:53;"Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be"
22:53;22:57;"Living in Beverly Hills"
22:57;23:02;"Beverly Hills, rolling like a sleigh"
23:02;23:08;"Beverly Hills, living in Beverly Hills"
23:08;23:12;"She says she thinks TC might need an Oki music history lesson."
23:12;23:14;"Is ""Oki"" a derogatory term?"
23:14;23:15;"No."
23:15;23:18;"Well, I think it was in, like, ""Grapes of Wrath"" day."
23:18;23:19;"Oh, was it derogatory?"
23:19;23:22;"Oh, yeah, because they were coming to California"
23:22;23:23;"and getting, like, spin on."
23:23;23:24;"Right, okay."
23:24;23:26;"Okay, but I'm reading her."
23:26;23:29;"So I want everybody from Oklahoma to know I'm reading her email."
23:29;23:32;"Let's start with when you did the top artist from each state."
23:32;23:33;"Oh, that was like an old episode."
23:33;23:34;"That's a deep callback."
23:34;23:36;"Shout out to Emily and her husband."
23:36;23:38;"I think that was the 4th of July, 2016 episode."
23:38;23:42;"Okay, they were in line. They really are huge TC heads."
23:42;23:44;"Oklahoma's top artist is Garth Brooks, of course."
23:44;23:46;"He's the best-selling solo albums artist in the U.S."
23:46;23:48;"But when GB's music wasn't on Apple Music,"
23:48;23:50;"you played a Florida Georgia Line cover."
23:50;23:53;"Now, I like FGL as much as the next TC head,"
23:53;23:56;"but there are so many Oklahoma artists that you could have used instead."
23:56;23:58;"Wait, wait, I don't even remember this."
23:58;24:00;"Was it Florida Georgia Line from Oklahoma?"
24:00;24:02;"No, we played--"
24:02;24:05;"Wait, she says that we played a Florida Georgia Line version"
24:05;24:06;"of a Garth Brooks song."
24:06;24:07;"Oh, oh, okay."
24:07;24:09;"But this is the best sentence ever."
24:09;24:12;"Now, I like FGL as much as the next TC head."
24:12;24:15;"But there are so many Oklahoma artists that you could have used instead."
24:15;24:18;"So let's take a deep dive into Oklahoma's music history."
24:18;24:21;"Our first stop is someone who has been a significant voice"
24:21;24:23;"in both music and politics, Woody Guthrie."
24:23;24:24;"Straight up."
24:24;24:26;"Straight up. And we know with Woody Guthrie,"
24:26;24:29;"there's no Bob Dylan, there's no Jack White."
24:29;24:30;"There's no Bruce Springsteen."
24:31;24:34;"So, so many of these classic artists,"
24:34;24:36;"their lineage traces right back to Oklahoma."
24:36;24:39;"Born in Okemah, Guthrie wrote the timeless American tune"
24:39;24:40;"""This Land is Your Land."""
24:40;24:42;"Shout out to your duet with Bernie."
24:42;24:44;"Woody Guthrie was a prominent voice for the working class,"
24:44;24:48;"and he famously played a guitar that said, ""This machine kills fascists."""
24:48;24:49;"To learn more about this folk hero,"
24:49;24:52;"I highly recommend touring the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa."
24:52;24:53;"I would love to do that."
24:53;24:56;"Hell yeah. Next time we're in Tulsa, I'm hitting that up."
24:56;24:58;"You can't mention Tulsa without talking about Bob Wills,"
24:58;24:59;"aka the King of Western Swing."
24:59;25:02;"Oh, so he's from, I didn't know that. I thought he was from Texas."
25:02;25:04;"Well, because he had his group, you know, as she says,"
25:04;25:06;"Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys."
25:06;25:08;"But they rose to stardom in Tulsa,"
25:08;25:11;"where they broadcast a daily 45-minute live radio show"
25:11;25:14;"at Canes Ballroom, a historic music venue that still puts on sick shows."
25:14;25:15;"That's tight."
25:15;25:18;"There's a musical styling named after the green country capital"
25:18;25:19;"called Tulsa Sound,"
25:19;25:22;"which is a mixture of rockabilly country, rock and blues."
25:22;25:25;"The kings of Tulsa Sound were Leon Russell and J.J. Cale."
25:25;25:26;"I love J.J. Cale."
25:26;25:27;"Yeah."
25:27;25:30;"Songs written by Cale have been recorded and covered by many TC faves."
25:30;25:35;"Eric Clapton, Jerry Garcia, Leonard Skinner, John Mayer, Fish."
25:35;25:38;"I love J.J. Cale. He's a really slept on."
25:38;25:42;"He has a studio, I think, in Tulsa in the early, mid '70s."
25:42;25:43;"Really?"
25:43;25:44;"Yeah."
25:44;25:47;"She goes on to list some emerging artists from Oklahoma,"
25:47;25:48;"the future--"
25:48;25:49;"What was--"
25:49;25:52;"Parker-- I don't think I can list all of them."
25:52;25:54;"We could post them somewhere."
25:54;25:57;"Parker Millsap, John Morland, Samantha Crane, John Fulbright,"
25:57;25:59;"Wink Bircham, among others."
25:59;26:02;"And then Oklahoma is home to many prominent modern country artists."
26:02;26:05;"Garth Brooks, Reba McIntyre, Blake Shelton, Toby Keith."
26:05;26:07;"Oklahoma's really punching above its weight."
26:07;26:08;"Does she live there?"
26:08;26:10;"Well, she says home to."
26:10;26:11;"I don't know."
26:11;26:14;"Can you imagine that, like a subdivision of McMansions"
26:14;26:16;"with all of the heavyweights of country live there?"
26:16;26:19;"So she says, ""Outside of the country genre, we relay claim to artists"
26:19;26:23;"such as All-American Rejects, Color Me Bad, Hanson, The Gap Band."""
26:23;26:25;"Oh, The Gap Band. Wow."
26:25;26:27;"""And a few indie darlings like St. Vincent and The Flaming Lips."""
26:27;26:29;"Oh, yeah, The Flaming Lips. Big Oklahoma."
26:29;26:33;"""Not to mention the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, Oklahoma."
26:33;26:36;"Lastly, where we live in Bardisville is where one of the largest"
26:36;26:39;"classical music festivals takes place, OK Mozart."
26:39;26:41;"We even have a Frank Lloyd Wright skyscraper here."""
26:41;26:42;"What?"
26:42;26:45;"""Also, did you know that Sonic is headquartered in OKC?"""
26:45;26:47;"Just a little corporate food history tie-in."
26:47;26:51;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
26:51;26:52;"News to me."
26:52;26:56;"""So if you're ever in Oklahoma, my husband Josh and I would love to show you all around."
26:56;26:58;"Hopefully we can show you that Oklahoma's a state with a storied history"
26:58;27:02;"steeped in our Native American heritage, our socialist roots, and our red dirt spirit."
27:02;27:06;"From the Tulsa race riots to the Dust Bowl to the OKC bombing,"
27:06;27:08;"we've faced our trials and tribulations."
27:08;27:12;"But we know that we belong to the land, and the land we belong to is grand."
27:12;27:16;"Labor, Omnia, Vincent, Emily."""
27:16;27:17;"Which I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right."
27:17;27:21;"I believe that's a Latin phrase used by..."
27:21;27:23;"Can we get a number crunch on that?"
27:23;27:27;"""P.S. Everyone support the teacher strike in Oklahoma in April."""
27:27;27:29;"Oh, yeah, we've got teachers all over this great land,"
27:29;27:32;"including some pretty red states, going on strike."
27:32;27:34;"Yep. Great email, Emily."
27:34;27:36;"Thanks for setting us straight."
27:36;27:39;"So the phrase that she used, ""Labor, Omnia, Vincent,"""
27:39;27:42;"is a Latin phrase meaning ""work conquers all."""
27:42;27:44;"And it's associated with the U.S. labor movement."
27:44;27:47;"I mean, Oklahoma might even be like a top ten music state."
27:47;27:48;"Really, when you get down to it."
27:48;27:49;"Per capita?"
27:49;27:51;"Definitely per capita, but I'm just saying..."
27:51;27:53;"You know, in Connecticut, it might be bottom five."
27:53;27:55;"Oh, easily. I think it's dead last."
27:55;27:56;"It's garbage."
27:56;27:57;"I agree."
27:57;27:59;"You know, I mean, also just in terms of the sheer number"
27:59;28:01;"of major artists coming out of the state,"
28:01;28:03;"I think Oklahoma's top ten."
28:03;28:07;"In terms of a small population producing important artists,"
28:07;28:11;"it's up there with, like, Jamaica, Ireland."
28:11;28:12;"These are small places."
28:12;28:13;"Minnesota."
28:13;28:15;"Minnesota is punching above its weight."
28:15;28:18;"I mean, obviously, there's, like, the California, New York, and Texas."
28:18;28:20;"A lot of big artists come out of there."
28:20;28:21;"And those are massive states."
28:21;28:22;"Duh."
28:22;28:24;"And she's also right that Oklahoma's faced a lot of trials and tribulations,"
28:24;28:26;"but it still produced a lot of great music."
28:26;28:30;"Whereas pampered Connecticut, that southwestern corner,"
28:30;28:31;"all that big money..."
28:31;28:33;"Cranking out John Mayer, dude."
28:33;28:36;"All right."
28:36;28:39;"From now on, Time Crisis is a pro-Oklahoma show"
28:39;28:41;"and an anti-Connecticut show."
28:41;28:46;"Not going to have any argument from me on this one."
28:46;28:49;"They call me the breeze"
28:49;28:53;"I keep blowing and blow"
28:53;29:00;"They call me the breeze"
29:00;29:03;"I keep blowing and blow"
29:03;29:10;"I ain't got me nobody"
29:10;29:14;"I ain't got me no love"
29:15;29:20;"Ain't no change in the world"
29:20;29:24;"Ain't no change in me"
29:24;29:30;"Ain't no change in the world"
29:30;29:34;"Ain't no change in me"
29:34;29:41;"I ain't hiding from nobody"
29:41;29:45;"Ain't nobody hiding from me"
29:45;29:49;"(instrumental break)"
30:20;30:24;"I got that green light, baby"
30:24;30:27;"I got the beat moving on"
30:27;30:34;"I got that green light, baby"
30:34;30:37;"I got the beat moving on"
30:37;30:44;"I'm a go out to California"
30:44;30:46;"I'm a go out to Georgia"
30:48;30:52;"(instrumental break)"
30:52;30:56;"Speaking of Connecticut, we're now joined in the studio by Chris Baio."
30:56;30:58;"What's up? Are you from CT?"
30:58;31:01;"No. But you have spent significant amounts of time in CT."
31:01;31:06;"Definitely thrown down in CT and it's a, I guess it's like a 15 minute drive from where I grew up."
31:06;31:07;"Wait, where'd you grow up?"
31:07;31:09;"Westchester, town of Bronxville, New York."
31:09;31:10;"That's basically CT."
31:10;31:17;"Yeah, I mean arguably Westchester County and southwestern Connecticut are one mega area."
31:17;31:19;"That's like Don Draper country."
31:19;31:26;"When you grow up on that side of the border in New York State, are there any reasons why people are like,"
31:26;31:29;"""Oh, we gotta rip over to Connecticut. I'm not paying."""
31:29;31:32;"Like, do you go over there for gas or like Costco or anything like that?"
31:32;31:34;"Oh God, I honestly can't remember."
31:34;31:37;"Do you ever go to shows in New Haven or like Toad's Place or anything?"
31:37;31:40;"I would go to some like hardcore shows in Danbury."
31:40;31:41;"Yeah, Danbury?"
31:41;31:45;"Yeah, and I think I played in Danbury once when I was growing up."
31:45;31:49;"Actually, okay, let's just like slow a roll a little bit on CT."
31:49;31:51;"There's the famed CT HC scene."
31:51;31:52;"Oh yeah."
31:52;31:53;"All right, Connecticut hardcore."
31:53;31:56;"That's like, maybe it's greatest musical legacy."
31:56;31:57;"Who is it that counts?"
31:57;31:58;"I don't either."
31:58;31:59;"Is Earth Crisis?"
31:59;32:00;"Do you know who's from CT also is Moby."
32:00;32:01;"Oh yeah."
32:01;32:02;"He came out of the CT HC scene."
32:02;32:04;"He was a Connecticut hardcore dude."
32:04;32:08;"Oh, not to name drop, but when I met Moby and I told him I was from Bronxville, he's like,"
32:08;32:10;"""Oh, love the architecture in Bronxville."""
32:10;32:11;"Really?"
32:11;32:12;"That's a cool name."
32:12;32:13;"I was blown away."
32:13;32:15;"I normally wouldn't share a story like that, but I was just-"
32:15;32:16;"Is he talking like-"
32:16;32:18;"Moby's really cool."
32:18;32:19;"I thought when I met him, he's a cool guy."
32:19;32:20;"I bet."
32:20;32:21;"Is he talking about-"
32:21;32:24;"No, Moby, I know you're from Connecticut, but you're a cool guy, man."
32:24;32:26;"I'll give you a pass on this one."
32:26;32:30;"No, is he talking about the architecture on like the main drag or like the homes?"
32:30;32:31;"I didn't grill him."
32:31;32:33;"I just took the compliment."
32:33;32:36;"He might've just been referring to the stately homes."
32:36;32:39;"You know, Moby is kind of into flipping houses in LA now."
32:39;32:40;"Is he really?"
32:40;32:41;"I went to an open-"
32:41;32:42;"It's kind of cold."
32:42;32:43;"It's kind of ruthless, right?"
32:43;32:44;"It's like some like-"
32:44;32:45;"Well, okay."
32:45;32:47;"Maybe is flipping house derogatory?"
32:47;32:48;"Yeah."
32:48;32:52;"So he's bought houses, renovated them, and then resold them for higher prices."
32:52;32:53;"Sizable profits."
32:53;32:57;"But yeah, I guess the flipping, maybe flipping implies that you did like a shitty renovation."
32:57;32:59;"Yeah, flipping implies very quick."
32:59;33:03;"Like you're putting in Home Depot cabinets, bad linoleum, and you're just like turning it around."
33:03;33:05;"No, Moby's not hitting the depot."
33:05;33:10;"But there was a house on the market in LA, and there was an open house, and I was in the neighborhood, so I went to check it out."
33:10;33:19;"And I'm sure this is not him, but the selling agent, I think we've talked on Time Crisis before about the hilariously over-the-top language of real estate listings."
33:19;33:20;"Yeah."
33:20;33:27;"And this one said, ""The opening line from the creative force known as Moby comes,"" you know, whatever."
33:27;33:31;"The address, 2119 Briarcliff Lane."
33:31;33:32;"It was like some shit like that."
33:32;33:33;"Oh my God."
33:33;33:37;"And then it was, you know, a nice old 1920s LA house that had been renovated tastefully."
33:37;33:45;"And then when you walked in in the living room, the selling agents were there, and they were like bumping a little Moby on the speaker."
33:45;33:46;"Wow."
33:46;33:47;"Nice."
33:47;33:48;"So I wonder what's in it for him."
33:48;33:52;"I mean, sure, he's making some money, but it must be like a fun kind of--"
33:52;33:57;"He clearly has an interest in architecture, as I can verify from the conversation I had with him."
33:57;33:58;"There you go."
33:58;33:59;"It's an outlet for his expression."
33:59;34:00;"I totally get it."
34:00;34:01;"Yeah."
34:01;34:05;"It's like you're Moby, you're sitting on all that--"
34:05;34:06;"Play money."
34:06;34:07;"All that play money."
34:07;34:10;"It's another way to invest your money that's arguably more creative."
34:10;34:11;"I love it."
34:11;34:12;"I'd love to see his houses."
34:12;34:18;"I'll let you know the next time one's on the market, we can hit up an open house from the creative force known as Moby."
34:18;34:24;"But the funny thing about it too is like, you know, he has very specific hallmarks of his music, you know?"
34:24;34:25;"Yeah."
34:25;34:29;"Like Moby music has had a sound or various sounds over the ages."
34:29;34:32;"Then you go to the house and it's not like-- it's just like a nice house."
34:32;34:35;"It's an old house that's tastefully redone."
34:35;34:41;"Yeah, you'd really have to rack your brain to be like-- if you were like assigned an essay, what--"
34:41;34:42;"The aesthetic continuity."
34:42;34:49;"Yeah, what are the aesthetic continuity between Moby play and 2145 Briarcliff Road?"
35:16;35:26;"In my dreams I'm dying all the time"
35:26;35:36;"Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind"
35:36;35:42;"I never meant to hurt you"
35:42;35:49;"I never meant to lie"
35:49;35:55;"So this is goodbye"
35:55;35:57;"This is goodbye"
35:57;36:00;"Anyway, Chris, thanks for coming in today."
36:00;36:01;"Good to be back."
36:01;36:07;"Actually, I brought $2 because I-- last time I was here a year and a half ago, I borrowed $2 from Jake to tip the valet guy."
36:07;36:08;"I just remembered it."
36:08;36:09;"What the hell?"
36:09;36:10;"Wow."
36:10;36:12;"What? How did you remember that, man?"
36:12;36:13;"I'll take this."
36:13;36:14;"Because I was coming back, you know?"
36:14;36:15;"I'll take the money."
36:15;36:18;"Last time I was here a year and a half ago, that was the last thing I did here."
36:18;36:19;"Wow."
36:19;36:20;"Borrowed $2 from Jake."
36:20;36:21;"Thanks, man."
36:21;36:22;"Yeah."
36:22;36:23;"Look at that. The cosmic balance has been restored."
36:23;36:24;"Put that in my wallet."
36:24;36:27;"So I haven't followed this story very closely."
36:27;36:35;"I was kind of introduced to this story actually via your Instagram, which, you know, sometimes in the social media age, you come upon something"
36:35;36:41;"and you're first introduced to a meme or a story or a campaign and you realize you already missed half of it"
36:41;36:45;"because people are already talking about it and you're seeing the meta commentary about it."
36:45;36:49;"But what I'm talking about is Sting and Shaggy."
36:49;36:50;"Yes."
36:50;36:53;"And for people who don't know, Shaggy is a dancehall artist."
36:53;36:57;"Probably his biggest hit in America was ""It Wasn't Me"" featuring Rick Rock."
36:57;36:59;"You remember that song, Jake?"
36:59;37:00;"I don't think I do."
37:00;37:01;"Mr. Bombastic?"
37:01;37:02;"If I heard it, I'd probably--"
37:02;37:03;"Oh, yeah. What about Mr. Bombastic in the '90s?"
37:03;37:05;"The titles are not resonating, but if I heard the song, I'd probably--"
37:05;37:06;"Definitely."
37:06;37:07;"You don't remember--"
37:07;37:09;"♪ And then I had her on the counter ♪"
37:09;37:10;"♪ It wasn't me ♪"
37:10;37:11;"♪ Dun-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪"
37:11;37:12;"♪ It wasn't me ♪"
37:12;37:14;"♪ She even had me on camera ♪"
37:14;37:15;"Oh, yeah. Sure. Got you."
37:15;37:16;"That's Shaggy?"
37:16;37:17;"Yeah."
37:17;37:18;"Is he British?"
37:18;37:19;"No."
37:19;37:21;"I think he's Jamaican-American."
37:21;37:23;"Yeah. New York and Jamaica. He grew up between the two."
37:23;37:25;"So he's teaming up with Sting?"
37:25;37:29;"Somehow in my head, Shaggy was DJ Shadow."
37:29;37:30;"Wait, what?"
37:30;37:32;"Wait, what do you--"
37:32;37:33;"I don't know."
37:33;37:34;"What?"
37:34;37:37;"Because both names start with ""sh,"""
37:37;37:39;"and I don't know who either of them are."
37:39;37:40;"Okay."
37:40;37:42;"And I was like, DJ Shadow's like a British DJ, right?"
37:42;37:44;"DJ Shadow's from, like, Davis, California."
37:44;37:46;"Okay, I don't know anything. Forget it."
37:46;37:49;"What is this Shaggy and Sting thing?"
37:49;37:53;"Basically, last fall, I got really back into Sting."
37:53;37:57;"I was listening a ton to Synchronicity and Ten Summoners Tales,"
37:57;37:59;"just, like, cranking them nonstop,"
37:59;38:02;"probably from, like, mid-October to the end of the year."
38:02;38:06;"Then I also have an annual Christmas party called Peckmas"
38:06;38:08;"in the neighborhood I live in called Peckham."
38:08;38:10;"And there are two parts of the party."
38:10;38:13;"One, we get together with friends and sing holiday classics,"
38:13;38:17;"and then the second part later in the evening is the dance party."
38:17;38:23;"And the playlist is usually, like, mid-'90s to early-2000s rap and R&B hits."
38:23;38:27;"And Shaggy actually features very prominently on that playlist."
38:27;38:29;"I also ended up having an emergency New Year's Eve party,"
38:29;38:31;"and I didn't have time to prepare a new playlist,"
38:31;38:34;"so I recycled the one from the party I had thrown a couple weeks ago."
38:34;38:38;"So, again, I was just listening a ton to Shaggy and Sting."
38:38;38:42;"And then I saw--I just, you know, booted up Twitter one day"
38:42;38:46;"and saw that Sting and Shaggy had made an entire collaborative album."
38:46;38:50;"This was, like, beginning of January, and that it was coming out on 4/20."
38:50;38:53;"And already it just really appealed to me."
38:53;38:55;"[laughter]"
38:55;38:57;"Is it branded as, like, a weed thing?"
38:57;38:59;"Well, no."
38:59;39:01;"So, for my perspective, I see this album,"
39:01;39:04;"two artists that I love are dropping a record on 4/20."
39:04;39:09;"And then I saw they played an event around Super Bowl Sunday,"
39:09;39:11;"you know, just that weekend in Minnesota."
39:11;39:14;"And I saw a photo of the two of them with Guy Fieri."
39:14;39:16;"And at that moment, I was just, like, blown away."
39:16;39:21;"It seemed like this whole album was tailor-made to go as viral as possible"
39:21;39:23;"for as long as possible."
39:23;39:25;"So I'd already been thinking about the record"
39:25;39:27;"and reading about it a bunch for, like, three weeks."
39:27;39:29;"And also, just from my perspective,"
39:29;39:34;"is that when people, like, make fun of Sting, like, solo Sting or late period Sting,"
39:34;39:37;"it's because they describe him as being, like, self-serious,"
39:37;39:39;"which is not how I feel about Sting."
39:39;39:42;"But it's like they think of him as being this very serious guy"
39:42;39:45;"who's into, like, tantric sex and plays the lute."
39:45;39:50;"He's not known for his, you know, wacky, meme-esque sense of humor."
39:50;39:51;"Yeah, not at all."
39:51;39:54;"But so I saw all these things, and I really liked the first single,"
39:54;39:56;"which is called ""Don't Make Me Wait."""
39:56;39:59;"And so I just started doing a deep dive on press that they were doing."
39:59;40:01;"I mean, I know they played a bunch at the Grammys,"
40:01;40:05;"but they're just doing so much press in so many interviews."
40:05;40:09;"And I was truly blown away by their chemistry in terms of doing interviews,"
40:09;40:11;"just cracking jokes."
40:11;40:13;"It's the kind of thing you can't really fake."
40:13;40:15;"And they seemed down for whatever."
40:15;40:20;"They definitely subscribed to the ""Yes, and"" school of, like, improv comedy."
40:20;40:21;"[laughter]"
40:21;40:24;"They're doing interviews all day, and they're killing every single one."
40:24;40:25;"Wow."
40:25;40:30;"So I sort of just started posting little bits of press they were doing"
40:30;40:33;"or interviews or little performances."
40:33;40:37;"They, like, performed at a wine festival in Florence in Italy,"
40:37;40:39;"and there was a Daily Mail article that said,"
40:39;40:43;"""A grape friendship is brewing,"" which I really liked."
40:43;40:48;"And I guess what ended up happening is my friend, McKee,"
40:48;40:50;"is friends with their publicist."
40:50;40:51;"Wow."
40:51;40:54;"And I think she enjoyed the Sting and Shaggy content"
40:54;40:56;"I was bringing to my Instagram stories."
40:56;40:59;"So she told their publicist about this."
40:59;41:02;"Then later I found out that our travel agent, Lisa,"
41:02;41:06;"is also friends with their publicist and also told them about these posts"
41:06;41:08;"I was making on Instagram about Sting and Shaggy."
41:08;41:12;"So that's how a little buzz was created, hearing it from two different sources."
41:12;41:16;"And word got back to the dynamic duo."
41:16;41:21;"And then what they did was they taped a personalized message to me"
41:21;41:23;"thanking me for my support."
41:23;41:24;"I'm pulling this up right now."
41:24;41:26;"So this is where I entered this."
41:26;41:29;"Straight up, I didn't even know these guys were making an album together."
41:29;41:31;"Wait, I really have not had my ear to this tree."
41:31;41:34;"You know, I heard some vague thing because I didn't watch the Grammys this year,"
41:34;41:37;"and I saw some vague reference to Sting and Shaggy performing together."
41:37;41:43;"But the Grammys, as we know well, there's nothing they love more than a fun combo."
41:43;41:44;"Yeah, totally."
41:44;41:46;"And I figured maybe that's a one-off, so I didn't think twice about it."
41:46;41:50;"And then I'm scrolling Instagram one day and I see this."
41:50;41:51;"Hi, Chris."
41:51;41:53;"What's up, Chris? This is Shaggy."
41:53;41:54;"This is Sting."
41:54;41:57;"And, you know, we know you've been posting about this collaboration."
41:57;41:58;"We know you've been supporting us."
41:58;42:00;"We just want to say thank you, bro."
42:00;42:03;"And I'm saying big up to you and your band."
42:03;42:05;"You know, it's been an amazing collaboration."
42:05;42:07;"I can't wait for you to hit a record."
42:07;42:10;"And we're going to have a vampire weekend this weekend."
42:10;42:13;"[laughter]"
42:13;42:15;"Oh, my God."
42:15;42:16;"Unbelievable."
42:16;42:18;"Actually, I want to play some of the music."
42:18;42:19;"Yeah, play it."
42:19;42:20;"Because I haven't heard any of this."
42:20;42:21;"Well, the record's out."
42:21;42:22;"Well, no, no, just the singles."
42:22;42:23;"Sorry."
42:23;42:25;"So this is the single you were referencing before, ""Don't Make Me Wait."""
42:51;42:54;"It's nice to hear Sting getting back to some, you know, Jamaican vibes."
42:54;42:55;"Oh, yeah."
43:09;43:10;"Are you feeling it, Jake?"
43:10;43:14;"I'm feeling it."
43:14;43:15;"All right, nice."
43:15;43:16;"I'm feeling it, man."
43:16;43:17;"I'm feeling something."
43:28;43:31;"Well, I'll say, this is like the most fun music Sting's been a part of in a while."
43:31;43:35;"I feel like his last few records were like medieval Christmas albums and sh--."
43:35;43:37;"Yeah, no, it's definitely fun."
43:37;43:38;"I think it's really fun."
43:38;43:43;"But so you said when you saw them with Guy Fieri that it seemed designed to go viral."
43:43;43:47;"So by that, do you mean that you could tell that their attitude towards this project was--"
43:47;43:51;"not that the music is not serious, but that from the beginning of it,"
43:51;43:54;"they were having fun, not taking themselves too seriously?"
43:54;43:55;"Yeah."
43:55;43:56;"Definitely."
43:56;43:58;"Because I feel like you look at old footage of the police doing interviews and it's so tense"
43:58;44:02;"and everybody's so serious, and yeah, you feel like Sting wouldn't have been taking a picture"
44:02;44:04;"with Guy Fieri in the mid '80s, the equivalent."
44:04;44:07;"No, it's like Sting hasn't been in a band for 30 years."
44:07;44:12;"He probably hasn't done press with another person for Days on End in forever."
44:12;44:15;"I can tell he really, really enjoys doing these interviews with Shaggy."
44:15;44:17;"They are truly delightful."
44:17;44:20;"Well, actually, since you're talking about so much, it makes me want to see them."
44:20;44:22;"Is there one that we could go to maybe?"
44:22;44:28;"The thing is a lot of them kind of all start in the same place of how they started their collaboration,"
44:28;44:30;"and then the fun stuff comes later."
44:30;44:33;"So I've probably watched three or four hours of interviews with these guys."
44:33;44:36;"That was why when they sent that message, Micky emailed it to me,"
44:36;44:40;"and I thought I was going to have a heart attack because I had been watching these guys so much,"
44:40;44:42;"and all of a sudden they were talking at me."
44:42;44:44;"It was pretty trippy."
44:44;44:48;"But this one, I guess it's with the popular website Ladbible."
44:48;44:50;"It's a little more like free association."
44:50;44:51;"I thought this one was cool."
44:51;44:54;"I posted a little segment from this, but I'll just play it."
44:54;44:57;"You can't say it wasn't me, especially with the milk mustache."
44:57;45:00;"[laughter]"
45:00;45:01;"Wasn't me."
45:01;45:03;"But you got a milk mustache, bro."
45:03;45:06;"[laughter]"
45:06;45:07;"Hi, I'm Sting."
45:07;45:10;"And I'm Shaggy, and we are here to give you some life advice."
45:10;45:11;"Shut up."
45:11;45:12;"Sure."
45:12;45:13;"Timing."
45:13;45:18;"I need an epic icebreaker to ask the girl I fancy on a date."
45:18;45:20;"Drew from London."
45:20;45:25;"Oh, you must be tired because you've been running around my mind all day."
45:25;45:27;"That's pretty good. Of course that's pretty good."
45:27;45:28;"Did that work?"
45:28;45:29;"This is Lexi from Bromley."
45:29;45:32;"My girlfriend caught me red-handed creeping with the girl next door."
45:32;45:35;"[laughter]"
45:35;45:38;"What should I do? She isn't answering my calls anymore."
45:38;45:39;"It's sad."
45:39;45:41;"[laughter]"
45:41;45:43;"It's tragic, actually."
45:43;45:45;"Go around with some flowers. Maybe that will cost you money."
45:45;45:46;"Wow."
45:46;45:48;"I haven't seen the side of Sting in a long time."
45:48;45:49;"Yeah, that's great."
45:49;45:52;"Maybe just because the last time I can really picture Sting doing press"
45:52;45:55;"is watching a documentary about the police and him in the '80s."
45:55;45:59;"It's also a reminder of how much the media landscape has changed."
45:59;46:02;"Yeah, just like Sting doing a Ladbible interview,"
46:02;46:06;"kind of giving advice on, like, my flatmate is stealing from me or something."
46:06;46:10;"Because when Sting came up, that was like the superstar era."
46:10;46:12;"Like these kind of godlike people."
46:12;46:15;"Whereas now, we want to see people just be real."
46:15;46:19;"I saw today that they booked the Queen's 92nd birthday party"
46:19;46:21;"the day after their album drops on April 21st."
46:21;46:23;"Right, right, yeah, we heard about that."
46:23;46:25;"So they will be performing for the Queen."
46:25;46:26;"Yeah, I think so."
46:26;46:29;"For the whole royal family. Actually, we have an article about it."
46:29;46:32;"Are there other bands on the bill, or is it just them?"
46:32;46:36;"Yeah, but for her 92nd birthday, Queen Elizabeth II will receive Sting and Shaggy."
46:36;46:39;"The duo are among performers slated for Her Majesty's Birthday concert"
46:39;46:42;"at London's Royal Albert Hall on April 21st,"
46:42;46:45;"a day after they released their joint album 44/876."
46:45;46:47;"Is that like in area codes?"
46:47;46:48;"Country code."
46:49;46:50;"England, Jamaica."
46:50;46:51;"Oh, wow. Yeah, they're not alone."
46:51;46:54;"They're also going to have Kylie Minogue, Craig David, Tom Jones,"
46:54;46:56;"and Lady Smith Black Mambazo."
46:56;47:00;"I'm also just curious about what does this mean, the Queen's 92nd birthday?"
47:00;47:02;"Did they actually consult the Queen and say,"
47:02;47:05;"""Are there any records you're psyched for this year?"""
47:05;47:08;"She's like, ""I heard about that Sting-Shaggy collab."""
47:08;47:09;"She must be."
47:09;47:12;"# You fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect"
47:12;47:15;"# Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest deepest"
47:15;47:18;"# You live your life like a canary in a coal mine"
47:18;47:22;"# You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line"
47:22;47:25;"# You say you want to spend the winter in Forenza"
47:25;47:28;"# You're so afraid to catch a dose of influenza"
47:28;47:32;"# You live your life like a canary in a coal mine"
47:32;47:35;"# You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line"
47:37;47:39;"# Canary in a coal mine"
47:39;47:42;"# Canary in a coal mine"
47:45;47:49;"# Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
47:49;47:51;"So, actually, I'm glad that you're here for this one, Chris,"
47:51;47:55;"because Cynthia Nixon is running for governor in New York."
47:55;47:56;"Oh, yeah."
47:56;47:59;"Are you a Sex and the City head? An SATC head?"
47:59;48:02;"Yeah, definitely. I've seen every episode on both movies."
48:02;48:05;"The second movie is truly a challenging watch."
48:05;48:06;"Hit Abomination?"
48:06;48:07;"It's a challenging watch."
48:07;48:09;"That's the one where they're in the Middle East?"
48:09;48:10;"Yeah, and it has an aged walk."
48:10;48:11;"I saw that one."
48:11;48:12;"You saw that one? Yeah."
48:12;48:13;"Yeah, on a plane."
48:13;48:15;"Oh, I remember that, actually."
48:15;48:16;"This is so stupid."
48:16;48:19;"When I got deferred from Columbia, when I applied there,"
48:19;48:22;"I was, like, really dark in a really bad place."
48:22;48:23;"Damn."
48:23;48:27;"And then the way I got out of my sad place was by binging on Sex and the City."
48:27;48:29;"Whoa. So you were, like, a senior in high school."
48:29;48:31;"That got you out of a sad place?"
48:31;48:33;"Absolutely. I love that."
48:33;48:35;"I mean, it's a really good show."
48:35;48:38;"Yeah, and my mom had bought the DVDs, so they were in the basement."
48:38;48:40;"Oh, this is before the streaming era."
48:40;48:41;"Oh, yeah, definitely."
48:41;48:44;"So I've tried these DVDs out, and I really enjoyed it."
48:44;48:46;"Jake, have you ever seen SATC?"
48:46;48:47;"Oh, yeah."
48:47;48:48;"Oh, really? Are you an SATC head?"
48:48;48:49;"No, not a head."
48:49;48:50;"But you respect it?"
48:50;48:51;"Yeah."
48:51;48:53;"Do you know the names of the four characters?"
48:53;48:54;"Samantha."
48:54;48:55;"[laughs]"
48:55;48:56;"Wait, is that the Carrie?"
48:56;48:57;"No, no, no. Carrie?"
48:57;48:58;"Yeah."
48:58;48:59;"Wait, is that the Carrie?"
48:59;49:00;"Yeah."
49:00;49:01;"Wait, wait, wait."
49:01;49:02;"You're good. You can keep going."
49:02;49:03;"Carrie."
49:03;49:05;"There was a woman named, like, Margaret?"
49:05;49:06;"Miranda."
49:07;49:08;"Red letter."
49:08;49:11;"And then there was the woman with the brown hair, who was, like, kind of the least interesting character."
49:11;49:12;"Debatable."
49:12;49:13;"I don't remember her."
49:13;49:14;"Uh, wait."
49:14;49:15;"The actress is--"
49:15;49:16;"Phoebe? No."
49:16;49:17;"[laughs]"
49:17;49:18;"Charlotte."
49:19;49:22;"Played wonderfully by Kristen Davis, in my opinion."
49:22;49:23;"Okay."
49:23;49:24;"Yeah, I'm not bagging on the actress."
49:24;49:26;"I just assumed that character--"
49:26;49:28;"[laughs]"
49:28;49:30;"I think you were bagging on the actress."
49:30;49:32;"I feel like the writing really fell short for that."
49:32;49:33;"But here's the thing."
49:33;49:34;"I'm not ahead."
49:34;49:35;"I don't know the full arc."
49:35;49:42;"Well, Baio, in the fan community, is Charlotte considered to be the boring one?"
49:42;49:49;"I think, arguably, the four characters all had such strong arcs that different people could identify with different ones."
49:49;49:50;"Okay."
49:50;49:51;"Wow."
49:51;49:52;"They're like the Beatles."
49:52;49:53;"Definitely."
49:53;49:54;"Everybody got a favorite."
49:54;49:55;"But Charlotte is like the Ringo."
49:55;49:56;"[laughs]"
49:56;49:57;"Damn."
49:57;49:58;"He got his knighthood in the end."
49:58;49:59;"[laughs]"
49:59;50:06;"Well, so, for all the TC news heads who get their news from Time Crisis, like a week or two ago,"
50:06;50:12;"it was announced that the actress Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City,"
50:12;50:16;"which is her best-known role, certainly not her only role, is running for governor."
50:16;50:18;"In the fan community, what's Cynthia Nixon's deal?"
50:18;50:24;"And I'm sure it gets confusing because people can't sometimes combine the person and the characters a lot."
50:24;50:31;"Yeah, I hesitate to speak for the fan community because I feel like my interactions with it are very much kind of in a bubble."
50:31;50:34;"I didn't necessarily read message boards and stuff."
50:34;50:36;"I'm not active in the fan community."
50:36;50:39;"I have a very kind of personal relationship with the show."
50:39;50:44;"But as that article you have says, I think she's been very politically active for a long time."
50:44;50:45;"Right."
50:45;50:50;"This article says Cynthia Nixon isn't new to politics because I'll admit I had the reaction a lot of people had, like,"
50:50;50:52;"""Oh, another celebrity politician."
50:52;50:53;"Don't we need to kind of…"""
50:53;50:56;"No, but I think she's done her time."
50:56;50:59;"Well, her campaign treasurer is Zephyr Teachout."
50:59;51:04;"I've always wondered if that's how you pronounce that name, Zephyr Teachout or T-shoe."
51:04;51:05;"It's a cool name."
51:05;51:10;"A progressive working families party candidate who challenged Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic primary."
51:10;51:14;"So she's got, you know, some real political people on her team."
51:14;51:15;"That's nice, actually."
51:15;51:19;"I would always vote working families when I voted in local elections."
51:19;51:28;"Yeah, they're like, if somebody's got the Democrats and the working families behind them, reason to hope that they're a little more to the left."
51:28;51:30;"So Cynthia Nixon's a lifelong resident of New York."
51:30;51:34;"She grew up in Manhattan, attended public schools, and sent her children to public schools."
51:34;51:35;"Okay."
51:35;51:40;"Not a lot of big-name celebs send their kids to public schools in New York."
51:40;51:44;"I'm not trying to throw under the bus, but did Sarah Jessica Parker send her kids to public school?"
51:44;51:46;"Doubt it."
51:46;51:47;"Maybe she did."
51:47;51:48;"I don't know."
51:48;51:52;"The only question that I have is, why do you start at governor?"
51:52;51:56;"Isn't that like a high level to start at, or is that exactly what we need?"
51:56;52:02;"You know, because she's no stranger to politics, but this would be her first time seeking office."
52:02;52:05;"Maybe because she already has the name recognition, you know?"
52:05;52:06;"Yeah, maybe it's not about like—"
52:06;52:12;"It's like, if you're not a famous person, you have to start running for city council and chip your way up."
52:12;52:13;"Right."
52:13;52:14;"If you're already famous, it's like—"
52:14;52:22;"I think she's also being strategically intelligent because there's a—I think Governor Cuomo has a lot of vulnerabilities in terms of the MTA."
52:22;52:25;"She's a New York City resident riding the subway every day."
52:25;52:33;"She can sort of channel the frustrations people have that, you know, Cuomo maybe doesn't experience being up in Albany."
52:33;52:35;"Right, but New York's a big-ass state."
52:35;52:43;"You got a lot of the population down in the city, but, you know, Cynthia Nixon, you know, she better pack a fleece."
52:43;52:44;"A fleece."
52:44;52:46;"When she's getting up there to Buffalo."
52:46;52:47;"Thermos of hot coffee."
52:47;52:48;"Syracuse."
52:48;52:49;"Schenectady."
52:49;52:52;"It's the Wild West up there."
52:52;52:53;"Does she have a shot?"
52:53;52:54;"I haven't seen any polls."
52:54;52:55;"Uh-huh."
52:55;52:56;"My gut tells me she has a shot."
52:56;52:58;"But Cuomo's not popular."
52:58;53:00;"And so, I'm asking—"
53:00;53:01;"No, I think she has a shot."
53:01;53:02;"I don't know anything about—"
53:02;53:04;"People are talking about her as if she has a shot."
53:04;53:08;"But it would be like New York City liberals getting behind her."
53:08;53:10;"She'd be running to the left of Cuomo, definitely."
53:10;53:18;"But, yeah, if you're a primary voter in upstate New York, maybe you're really liberal, but maybe you're more centrist or something."
53:18;53:19;"I don't know."
53:19;53:20;"Exactly."
53:20;53:25;"She's going to have to jump in the car, drive six and a half hours up there, and really put in the work."
53:25;53:26;"But maybe she can."
53:26;53:30;"Also, New York is famously run by political machines."
53:30;53:35;"The Democratic Party, the Republican Party of New York are tough to infiltrate."
53:35;53:38;"So, she would have whatever work could offer, but why not?"
53:38;53:43;"Can I ask, without President Donald Trump, is there a Governor Cynthia Nixon?"
53:43;53:47;"Did he normalize the celebrity as politician?"
53:47;53:49;"Well, there was already Governor Jesse Ventura."
53:49;53:50;"True."
53:50;53:51;"The Governator as well?"
53:51;53:52;"Yeah, the Governator."
53:52;53:53;"It's a good question, Seinfeld."
53:54;53:56;"I've got a question for you, Seinfeld."
53:56;53:57;"All right."
53:57;54:00;"Have you ever done a Sex and the City meets Seinfeld meme?"
54:00;54:03;"They're both four main cast members in New York."
54:03;54:08;"The shows, they both are associated with the 90s, albeit different parts of the 90s."
54:08;54:12;"Have you seen the Sarah Jessica, the Carrie behind her laptop thing?"
54:12;54:16;"And I wondered, I think I jumped on one of those a couple of years ago."
54:16;54:17;"I can't remember what the joke was."
54:17;54:21;"It probably had to do with Seinfeld being on television or whatever."
54:21;54:24;"That's probably the extent of it."
54:24;54:27;"That would be cool if they, I mean, these are all different companies,"
54:27;54:31;"but you know how Marvel's done such a great job of building the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
54:31;54:32;"Yeah."
54:32;54:33;"You heard about this, Jake?"
54:33;54:38;"If I see what the MCU was, would you?"
54:38;54:40;"I'd struggle with that."
54:40;54:43;"Michigan Central University."
54:43;54:45;"There probably are a bunch of different MCs,"
54:45;54:50;"but they've done a great job to the point that the forthcoming Avengers Infinity War film,"
54:50;54:52;"I think it might be the most expensive movie ever made."
54:52;54:54;"Infinity War?"
54:54;54:55;"Yeah."
54:55;54:57;"That's the worst sounding thing ever."
54:57;54:59;"Hey, what's your problem with that?"
54:59;55:02;"This is a terrible combination of words."
55:02;55:05;"I want nothing to do with Infinity War."
55:05;55:06;"I'm with you."
55:06;55:11;"Okay, but my point is that over the past 10, 15 years,"
55:11;55:14;"we didn't really have superhero movies of this nature back in the day."
55:14;55:16;"And over the past 10, 15 years,"
55:16;55:21;"Marvel has built up the MCU to the point that this forthcoming Avengers Infinity War,"
55:21;55:26;"if you look at the poster, we got Black Panther, the Hulk, Jake's yawning."
55:26;55:28;"He does not care about this."
55:28;55:30;"We got freaking Thor."
55:30;55:32;"Wait, but Hawkeye was left off, right?"
55:32;55:33;"Why?"
55:33;55:34;"I don't know."
55:34;55:35;"Nobody knows why."
55:35;55:37;"The Hawkeye heads are upset."
55:37;55:42;"But it's all been building up to this moment because they've built out the MCU and people are excited."
55:42;55:50;"And finally, there's going to be a huge movie where you're going to see Thor hanging out in Wakanda."
55:50;55:54;"Apparently, you're not going to have a Hawkeye, but you're going to have—"
55:54;55:56;"What are the other big ones?"
55:56;55:57;"You're going to have—"
55:57;55:58;"What about the Punisher, man?"
55:58;56:01;"You're going to have the Punisher murdering Iron Man."
56:01;56:03;"You know, that's really exciting for people."
56:03;56:04;"So anyway—"
56:04;56:05;"I'm pumped."
56:05;56:11;"Wouldn't it be cool if there was a New York cinematic universe and we do a New York Infinity War"
56:11;56:14;"and you got Jerry, Elaine, Craim—"
56:14;56:15;"I love this."
56:15;56:18;"Phoebe, Rachel, Chandler—"
56:18;56:19;"No, no, no."
56:19;56:20;"Samantha—"
56:20;56:22;"Paul Reiser."
56:22;56:23;"You could write it."
56:23;56:24;"Oh, okay."
56:24;56:25;"Oh, nice."
56:25;56:26;"I'm actually excited, but I'll propose this."
56:26;56:27;"All right."
56:27;56:32;"We do a time crisis, like Russian novels."
56:32;56:35;"1200 pages fan fiction."
56:35;56:36;"Wow."
56:36;56:39;"And you can get your just desserts that are—"
56:39;56:41;"No, I'm misusing that phrase."
56:41;56:46;"You can have your cake and eat it too because you can write out—"
56:46;56:48;"It's like Les Miserables, basically."
56:48;56:51;"And towards the end, there's a huge battle."
56:51;56:54;"And yeah, finally, Kramer and Chandler."
56:54;56:57;"This is really what it would be if this was Avengers Infinity War."
56:57;57:02;"In the trailer, it would just be Kramer and Chandler coming nose to nose,"
57:02;57:06;"facing each other in the ruins of the Empire State Building."
57:06;57:09;"And just the fans are like, ""Oh, that's going to be a sick fight."""
57:09;57:12;"You got George dating Monica."
57:12;57:13;"I love this idea."
57:13;57:16;"I earnestly love it, and I want Frasier to be in it."
57:16;57:18;"I know he's a Seattle guy, but I want Frasier in the mix."
57:18;57:20;"Well, he pops in for the weekend."
57:20;57:24;"I guess in some ways, it's not even the New York Cinematic Universe."
57:24;57:28;"It's really just the '90s TV Cinematic Universe."
57:28;57:31;"Get Caroline and the City in there. Get Roseanne."
57:31;57:34;"That could be a cool B story."
57:34;57:39;"Is that George Costanza and Charlotte have to travel to Seattle"
57:39;57:46;"to convince Dr. Frasier Crane to come help in the Infinity War."
57:46;57:49;"Frasier Crane, who was a beast in X-Men."
57:49;57:53;"Wait, and you know that Kelsey Grammer sings the Frasier theme song?"
57:53;57:54;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
57:54;57:55;"I just learned that."
57:55;57:56;"We did an episode on it."
57:56;57:58;"Oh, you did? Oh, sorry. I'm not up to date."
57:58;58:01;"That's very embarrassing. I'm sorry I'm not up to date."
58:01;58:05;"He missed episode 39 a year ago."
58:05;58:06;"The tossed salad and scrambled eggs."
58:06;58:07;"Yeah."
58:07;58:09;"Tossed salad and scrambled eggs."
58:09;58:11;"Based on the Joni Mitchell song."
58:11;58:12;"Oh, right."
58:12;58:13;"That closed out ""Court and Spark."""
58:13;58:15;"Yeah, it had a weird connection to Joni Mitchell."
58:15;58:18;"And actually, Frasier is part of the Cheers universe."
58:18;58:20;"Oh, yeah. It all connects."
58:20;58:23;"It's all an incestuous medley. It's a tossed salad."
58:23;58:26;"My analyst told me that I was right out of my head"
58:26;58:30;"The way he described it, he said I'd be better dead than live"
58:30;58:33;"I didn't listen to his jive"
58:33;58:36;"I knew all along that he was all wrong"
58:36;58:42;"And I knew that he thought I was crazy but I'm not, oh no"
58:42;58:46;"My analyst told me that I was right out of my head"
58:46;58:49;"He said I'd need treatment, but I'm not that easily led"
58:49;58:53;"He said I was the type that was most inclined"
58:53;58:56;"Went out of his sight to be out of my mind"
58:56;59:03;"And he thought I was nuts, no more ifs, or ands, or buts"
59:03;59:06;"They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild"
59:06;59:08;"With all my crazy ideas"
59:08;59:14;"But I knew what was happening, I knew I was a genius"
59:14;59:18;"What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three"
59:18;59:21;"I knew that this was meant to be"
59:21;59:24;"Have you guys ever watched TGIF, the Family Matters?"
59:24;59:25;"Oh yeah, oh sure"
59:25;59:26;"Do you remember the-"
59:26;59:27;"Oh yeah, they do crossovers, right?"
59:27;59:29;"Yeah, step by step, Urkel"
59:29;59:32;"I think Urkel like transported into the step by step house"
59:32;59:35;"Did Perfect Strangers do a crossover with Family Matters?"
59:35;59:39;"Yes, because Carl Winslow from Family Matters was in Perfect Strangers"
59:39;59:40;"If I'm not mistaken"
59:40;59:41;"Right, right"
59:41;59:42;"And he's in Die Hard"
59:42;59:47;"And then didn't Lieutenant John McClane make an appearance on Family Matters?"
59:47;59:48;"That episode?"
59:48;59:49;"I don't think so"
59:49;59:50;"Oh no"
59:50;59:52;"But he dated Jennifer Aniston"
59:52;59:53;"Bruce Willis?"
59:53;59:54;"Oh yeah, that was weird"
59:54;59:55;"John McClane did?"
59:55;59:57;"John McClane dated Rachel, I think"
59:57;59:58;"I love that"
59:58;01:00:01;"You're right, Bruce Willis, I don't think it was John McClane"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"No, it was John McClane"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"It's all connected"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"It is all connected"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Unbelievable"
01:00:05;01:00:06;"New York City Cop"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"90s TV Infinity War"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Welcome to the party, pal"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I love this"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"The 1400 page, two volume novel"
01:00:15;01:00:24;"It'll come like that Murakami novel in this beautiful box set with two gilded editions"
01:00:24;01:00:28;"You could throw in some obscure ones like The Single Guy, Jonathan Silverman"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"I remember that"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Yeah, like Boston Public was at the show with the"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"Dude, you're going deep right now"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"Too deep, yeah"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"Maybe Paul Reiser and Jerry have a face off"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"That'd be dope"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"Actually, I think Kramer was in A Mad About You"
01:00:42;01:00:45;"And I remember being upset about it because I hated Mad About You"
01:00:45;01:00:49;"Oh, Mad About You had crossover with Friends because Lisa Kudrow was on both"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"That's right, the twin sister"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"This Infinity War is writing itself"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"That's crazy"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Wait, wasn't there a Mad About You?"
01:00:56;01:01:00;"It was like right when Viagra came out and Paul Reiser took Viagra and then he had to leave the apartment"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And then he ran into Jerry Seinfeld or something"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh really?"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"He was like, ""Oh, it's so good to meet you"""
01:01:05;01:01:06;"And then Jerry's like"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"And he's just sporting a huge"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Oh really?"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Yeah, I can see that"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"I might have the characters mixed up"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"It sounds right"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"It makes sense, just two comedians living uptown"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"I kind of feel like there was some animosity though between Reiser and Seinfeld"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Because he jumped on that wave, right?"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"In real life?"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"I feel like Reiser just rode the coattails of Seinfeld and it was undeserved"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"Oh, well you're a mega fan"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Our audience is just tuning out"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"But I have a real question"
01:01:34;01:01:40;"Are we legally allowed to write this book using these characters that are the properties of various"
01:01:40;01:01:43;"Mega entertainment corporations?"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"You'd have to pre-clear a lot of stuff"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"I think this is an IP clusterf*ck"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"A lot of red tape"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Wait, but what about parody law?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Mmmmm"
01:01:52;01:01:56;"As I understand it, I think it has to be commentary on each of the shows"
01:01:56;01:02:00;"So if you say, ""Hey, your dad's an IP lawyer, right?"""
01:02:00;01:02:01;"We'll get him on the case"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"Alright, so"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"Get him on the horn right now"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"You're just like, ""Come on"""
01:02:07;01:02:09;"He's probably playing Y"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Yeah, exactly"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Dad, I really need to talk to you"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Okay, dad, you're familiar with the upcoming Avengers film, Infinity War?"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"What if it was 90s TV shows?"
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Okay, if we have any"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"I feel like every once in a while we'll get an email from somebody who just happens to work in a field"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"And they're like deeply knowledgeable about something that we were talking about"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"So if we got anybody who works in IP law or anything like that"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"If you can advise us on how to write the 90s Infinity War"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"8-minute Cape Cod"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"I think we're gonna get shut down"
01:02:36;01:02:40;"Well, I just want to know because I don't want to put the time in if we're gonna get sued over it"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"We just get a season-desist letter from NBC"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Pre-emptive"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"That's the next major time crisis project"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"We also still have to launch our baseball league"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"That's like the professional wrestling baseball league"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"Right"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"Not to mention the grape ice cream"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"Oh yeah"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"All of these ideas will never be touched on again"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"We have to"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"We need to do a time crisis"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"Crisis DC, come up with an idea and then never think about it again"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"No guys, I really mean it about this one"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"I'm very passionate"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"I'm serious guys"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"The fans want to see that Kramer, Chandler, Brawford"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"One of them is dying"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"Oh my god"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"Think about it, forget it"
01:03:19;01:03:22;"Come around and don't, don't, don't"
01:03:22;01:03:26;"If you just regret it"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"Don't bring the rest of 'em 'round, 'round, 'round"
01:03:29;01:03:34;"It is what it is"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"Until it was what it was"
01:03:37;01:03:42;"So just keep on swinging"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"If only because, 'cause, 'cause"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"I can tell by the look"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"You know me and what you say"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"Like a sentimental crook"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"It's tough to get away"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"If it even went better"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"I would play every part"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"But I'm too overeager"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"And I just fall astard"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Oh sister of a pearl"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"I wouldn't change"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"Your father world"
01:04:08;01:04:12;"Oh sister of a pearl"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"I wouldn't change"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Your father world"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"[Instrumental]"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"[Vocalizing]"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Think about it, forget it"
01:04:53;01:04:56;"Come around and don't, don't, don't"
01:04:56;01:05:00;"If you think it was pathetic"
01:05:00;01:05:03;"Bring it back, back around, 'round, 'round"
01:05:03;01:05:08;"I'm tired of finding"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"In another man's pointless foe"
01:05:11;01:05:15;"So please keep up with it"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"Just like you had done before"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"[Instrumental]"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I can tell by the look"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"You know me and what you say"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"Like a sentimental crook"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"It's tough to get away"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"If it even went better"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"I would play every part"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"But I'm too overeager"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"And I just fall astard"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"Oh sister of a pearl"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"I wouldn't change"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"Your father world"
01:05:42;01:05:46;"Oh sister of a pearl"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"I wouldn't change"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Your father world"
01:05:50;01:06:15;"It's time for the top five"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Five on iTunes"
01:06:18;01:06:22;"This week we're going to be comparing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1972"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"It's just a great year"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Yeah"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Europe '72"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"My buddy Kyle Field was born in '72"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"It's a major year"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Huge year"
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Right off the jump, a classic"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"The number five song on the Billboard charts"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"this week in 1972"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"It's a Paul Simon classic"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"Oh, okay"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"Oh, I love this song"
01:06:45;01:06:46;"This is cool"
01:06:46;01:06:51;"It's one of the first, like, white reggae hits in America"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"And the whole backing band is like actual Jamaican reggae musicians"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"Is this track one on his first solo record?"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"It's definitely the first solo, yeah, maybe it is track one"
01:07:11;01:07:14;"Jimmy Cliff's band, that's who's playing on it"
01:07:14;01:07:24;"So do you know the famous story about the title?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"No"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"So the song is called Mother and Child Reunion"
01:07:28;01:07:33;"So one would assume it's about the relationship between a mother and their child"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"reuniting after some bitterness or time apart"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"And actually it's named after a chicken and egg dish"
01:07:39;01:07:42;"that Paul Simon saw on a Chinese restaurant menu"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Wow"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"Because often Chinese restaurants have kind of fun names"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Right"
01:07:46;01:07:49;"Buddha's delight, things of that nature"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"And there's a dish that was chicken and egg"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"The mother and child"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"Cooked together for you to eat"
01:07:55;01:07:59;"Mother and child"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"That is like profoundly poetic"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Yeah"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"For a Chinese menu"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"You never know"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"If somebody's working back in the kitchen somewhere"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"They could be a great poet"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Maybe they just don't get a shot"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"Instead Paul Simon comes and takes that poetry and turns it into a hit"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"He steals Jimmy Cliff's band"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"He steals the title from the Chinese restaurant"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"What if there was some situation where like"
01:08:22;01:08:27;"The son or the daughter of the family who runs the Chinese restaurant"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"Was actually an aspiring songwriter"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Right"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"And he was just like"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Mom, dad, you know"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I want to be a full time musician"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"You're crazy"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"We worked so hard to build this business"
01:08:39;01:08:40;"You need to take it over"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"And he's like but I think in poetic units"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"I want to write songs"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"I'm all about language"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"And they're like"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Okay, you want to be a poet"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"You can be in charge of the menu"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"You like words so much"
01:08:50;01:08:51;"You can be in charge of the menu"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"He's like alright, maybe I will get creative"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"And he's like alright"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Mom, what's in this dish?"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"And she's like"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"It's like we mix up some chicken and eggs"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"And he's like what do you call it?"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"She's like what do you mean?"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"It's just chicken and eggs"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"You know"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"And he's like I'm going to call it mother and child reunion"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"She's like okay, whatever"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Whatever floats your boat"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"One day Paul Simon comes in"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Nervously waiting in the back"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I can't believe Paul Simon's in the restaurant"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"Doesn't get the nerve up to introduce himself"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"One year later"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"He's listening to the number of the top five songs"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"On the billboard charts"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"You can't copyright names"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Yeah"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Especially a title off a menu"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"[Laughs]"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Yeah"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"I mean the truth is"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"It's pretty cool that he wrote this song"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Based off"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"A dish"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"Off a menu"
01:09:35;01:09:38;"I wonder what the Jimmy Cliff dudes thought of this song"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Yeah, that's a good question"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"They were like, why are you playing reggae?"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Or they were like, great melodies"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Yeah"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Maybe a little of both"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"Paul, how did you come up with the title?"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"That's a funny story guys"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"Back home in New York"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"[Laughs]"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"There's a Chinese restaurant by my apartment"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"And I saw it on the menu"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Okay"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"[Laughs]"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"That was a very tasteful palette type song"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Yeah"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"The number five song right now on iTunes"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Will it be in a similarly tasteful palette?"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Let's find out"
01:10:09;01:10:10;"Probably not"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Well"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Define tasteful"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"It's Imagine Dragons with whatever it takes"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Imagine Dragons is"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"Killing it"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"Can't avoid them"
01:10:21;01:10:25;"Falling too fast to prepare for this"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"Tripping in the world could be dangerous"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Everybody's circling this vulture race"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"Negative, nepotist"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"Everybody waiting for the fall of pain"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"Everybody praying for the end of times"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Everybody hoping they could be the one"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"I was born to run, I was born for this"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"Whip whip, run me like a race"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Boys, pull me like a rift"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"This is rough"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"Not my favorite ID single"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Whip whip"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"But to all the Imagine Dragons fans"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"Their Evolve Tour starts June 5th"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Guess where?"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"LA"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Hartford, Connecticut"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Oh"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"At the outdoor amphitheater there?"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"I don't know, maybe at the"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"There's like a hockey arena"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"I'm not sure if that's still there"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"The Wailers left back in like '94"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"They didn't blow that s*** up?"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"They might have"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"The number four song back in '72"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Donny Osmond, ""Puppy Love"""
01:11:11;01:11:13;"I don't know if I know this"
01:11:13;01:11:18;"Song was written by Paul Anka"
01:11:18;01:11:26;"And they called it Puppy Love"
01:11:26;01:11:27;"Oh yeah, I know this song"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"I'm pretty into this"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"It's like Proto Bieber"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Something, no?"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"So, Paul Anka's version"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"had already been a Billboard hit in 1960"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Oh wow"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"So already in '72, this is him like covering"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"like an old corny song"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Right"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"'Cause he was like the clean cut guy"
01:11:45;01:11:50;"And why I love her so"
01:11:51;01:11:57;"And they called it Puppy Love"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"Not everything from the '70s is tasteful"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"How old was Donny Osmond at this time?"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Good question"
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Was he a teenager?"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"It's not, can I get a number crunch on that?"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Let's crunch those numbers"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"March '72"
01:12:09;01:12:13;"But couldn't you almost kind of see like T-Rex covering this?"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Yeah, because they had a kitschy side too"
01:12:16;01:12:17;"Yeah, and they had like funny strings"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Right, but the drums would be like tougher"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"Yeah, and like the tones would be all like"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"All right"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Just fuzzed out"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"He was 15"
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Oh, he was 15?"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"Yeah"
01:12:26;01:12:31;"Happy"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"Wild"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Donny, oh wow"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"The number four song in our era"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Oh look"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"Still Drake"
01:12:42;01:12:43;"Is this God's plan?"
01:12:43;01:12:47;"I went to a birthday party at a club a week or two ago"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"Yeah"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"And they played this song"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"What sort of club?"
01:12:50;01:12:53;"That place Los Globos in Silver Lake"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Okay"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Where they do different nights"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"Copy that"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"And it was a Saturday night, so it was like energy was high"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"And when they played this song"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"And he pulled the volume down for the famous line"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"The volume of people yelling it"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"The ""I only love my bed and my mama"""
01:13:10;01:13:11;"It was unbelievable"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"Wow"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"It's like"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"That's tight"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"It's like a football chant, basically"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"God's plan"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"It's like Sweet Caroline"
01:13:21;01:13:22;"Yeah"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"Maybe that will be the next wave of"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Arena"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Yeah, I mean"
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Anthems"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"It's only right, it should be rap"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"Sure"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Might go down in TOD"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"Baseball's starting soon"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"I wonder if any players are gonna walk up to the plate with God's plan"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"Oh, definitely"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"You know players like have their walk-up songs"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Right, that'd make a lot of sense"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"This would be dope"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"Now batting"
01:13:45;01:13:48;"For the Texas Rangers playing third base"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Ezra Kingham"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"It's out of the park"
01:13:51;01:13:56;"They should let you keep your music playing through your at-bat"
01:13:56;01:13:59;"Cause like it stops once you get there, right?"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Yeah, you have to concentrate"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"No, you know what they should do though?"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"If you hit a home run"
01:14:04;01:14:07;"They should start the music as you're rounding the bases"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Oh yeah, it comes back in"
01:14:08;01:14:11;"And then you're like hitting home plate"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"Pumping the chest"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Pointing to the sky"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"It's God's plan"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Like it was playing, then they turned it off"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"Then first pitch"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"Oh my God, it's out of here"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"And he just stands on the mound"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"And he's mouthing the words"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"""And my mama, I'm sorry"""
01:14:27;01:14:28;"And then he starts running"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"It's like blowing kisses"
01:14:30;01:14:37;"Big song"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Sound like God legs"
01:14:39;01:14:43;"Number three song in 1972 on the Billboard charts"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"Was The Lion Sleeps Tonight, classic song"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"Sure, by the Weavers, originally"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"Well yeah, and then there was the Tokens at the big hit"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Oh, okay, yeah, that's what I'm thinking of"
01:14:51;01:14:56;"When originally, originally it was, you know, written by Solomon Linda"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"I believe his name was this, that, that"
01:14:57;01:15:00;"There's a whole crazy thing about getting him as his publishing"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"But I didn't know that there was a hit version in 1972"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"It's by somebody named Robert John"
01:15:05;01:15:10;"That is the lamest artist name ever"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"Bob John"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Hi, my name is Robert John"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"I'm doing a cover of The Lion Sleeps Tonight"
01:15:18;01:15:21;"He's like doing one of those radio little promos"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"""Hi, this is Robert John, you're listening to KTLU"""
01:15:24;01:15:28;"""With my new hit single, The Lion Sleeps Tonight"""
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Are there gonna be crazy strings on this?"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Look man, I don't know what to expect"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"I mean, it's 1972 and you're just busting out The Lion Sleeps Tonight for your cover"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"And your name's Robert John"
01:15:39;01:15:42;"Robert John's either a very cool guy or a very lame guy"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"There's no in between"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"Oh, Bob John, he's actually one of the coolest guys I know"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"My guess is it's gonna be on some puppy love, like schlocky early 70s"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Like heavy orchestration"
01:15:51;01:15:54;"Maybe we'll get lucky and it's like on some weird glam rock, like minimalism"
01:15:54;01:15:58;"You know, like a fuzz guitar"
01:15:58;01:16:02;"Some wah"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Fah-wuz"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"I'm really excited to hear this"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"And it starts right now"
01:16:10;01:16:17;"So far so good"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Definitely like a folk guy"
01:16:19;01:16:22;"Some tasteful hand drums"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Hard to pan on the left with those bongos"
01:16:24;01:16:30;"Oh yeah, come on man"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Hi, this is Robert John"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"You're listening to my new hit single, The Lion Sleeps Tonight"
01:16:40;01:16:50;"Yeah, it's like the Carpenters or like the Bay City Rollers or something"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"Ooh, I like that slide"
01:16:53;01:17:02;"This is the banger version"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"This reminds me of BJ Thomas"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Like raindrops keep falling on my..."
01:17:07;01:17:12;"As far as like the..."
01:17:12;01:17:13;"Drum tones"
01:17:13;01:17:17;"The American versions, cause you know, the original like South African versions are sick too"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"But with the English language lyrics and stuff"
01:17:20;01:17:26;"This is the one that apparently Brian Wilson was driving in his convertible down PCH"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Early Beach Boys days"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"He heard this come on the radio, he pulled over"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"He was just like ""What?"""
01:17:31;01:17:32;"He was so overwhelmed by it"
01:17:33;01:17:37;"In the jungle, the mighty jungle"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"Yeah, it's actually like super proto-Pet sounds"
01:17:40;01:17:41;"Yeah"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Those like reverb-y drums and like rim shots"
01:17:43;01:17:49;"Hit, hit"
01:17:49;01:17:56;"So what year is this? 60? 62?"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Early 60s"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"Such a dope song"
01:18:02;01:18:09;"This is incredible, just vocals and drums for the verse"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Not even bass"
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Right"
01:18:12;01:18:17;"Yeah, that crazy, it sounds like a theremin"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"I was like, is it a theremin? No"
01:18:19;01:18:20;"It's like an opera singer"
01:18:20;01:18:24;"I bet that track completely influenced the theremin on Good Vibrations"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Oh yeah, that's true"
01:18:28;01:18:32;"When do you think the last cover of this song was?"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Oh, I'm sure there's..."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"If you search iTunes"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"But also, hold up"
01:18:35;01:18:39;"That's probably the greatest English language white people version of this song"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"Keep going back?"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"Yeah, if we keep going back"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"Miriam McCabe, an incredible South African singer"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"She had a version of this song"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"And I obviously don't know how to actually pronounce it"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"I think it's Mbube"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"M-B-U-B-E is the original name of the song"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"And this is her version"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"(singing)"
01:18:57;01:19:03;"Is this like 50s?"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"This would be like 50s, 60s too"
01:19:06;01:19:14;"I mean, the song transformed a lot when it came into English"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"(singing)"
01:19:19;01:19:31;"She had an incredible voice"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"You know, once I performed in a tribute to Miriam McCabe at Carnegie Hall"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"That Angelique Kidjo organized"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Whoa"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"Oh, this is so good"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Listen to that bass"
01:19:48;01:19:51;"I'm struggling to hear the same songs yet"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"Well, I did hear the ""hee-ee-ee-ee-ee-oo"""
01:19:54;01:19:57;"Now I'm getting it"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Right"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"No, but it is pretty different"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"(singing)"
01:20:05;01:20:31;"So what did you perform?"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"So she asked me to perform a Miriam McCabe song"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"That was in her language"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"One of the original languages of South Africa"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"It's spelled X-H-O-S-A"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"You could call it like ""cosa"" or something like that"
01:20:42;01:20:46;"But it's one of those languages where one of the sounds in it is the click"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"And for anybody who didn't grow up speaking one of those languages"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"To nail the pronunciation"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"It's hard to make the sound"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"So she kind of gave me this cheating way to do it"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"Where you don't actually do the clicks"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"Some of her music, it's like such a part of the sound"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"So I had to like awkwardly, phonetically sing this song"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"And Desmond Tutu was in the audience"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"I was like, ""Alright"""
01:21:07;01:21:09;"Glad they're not taping this"
01:21:09;01:21:12;"But let's take it all the way back"
01:21:12;01:21:16;"This is the original guy who wrote the song, Solomon Linda"
01:21:16;01:21:21;"And it was a big fight in the 90s for his family to get the songwriting credit"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Because after The Lion King came out"
01:21:23;01:21:26;"It was yet another wave of money for this"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"So it's like one of the biggest songs of all time"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"That's origins are with this guy"
01:21:30;01:21:34;"1939"
01:21:34;01:21:46;"Whoever kind of put it into English"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"They just kind of sounded like they were saying ""Wimowe"""
01:21:48;01:21:50;"They don't know what that meant"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"It's just totally phonetic"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"Wimowe"
01:21:57;01:22:03;"So you have a lot of the constituent elements"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Ya-boo-da-ba"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"And the ""ee"""
01:22:07;01:22:10;"Weirdly consistent theme so far in the top five"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"With the Paul Simon"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"He would later go on to like"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"South Africa"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Work with South African"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"And like adapt South African songs"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"So you know, it's interesting listening to these old versions"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"Is where exactly did the verse melody come from?"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"The ""da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da"""
01:22:26;01:22:28;"It's like a little bit in there"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"Maybe someone just came up with it"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"Like in an inspired moment"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"""Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da"""
01:22:42;01:22:44;"So the Americans made up the funny like"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Disney jungle book lyrics"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"Although I think the lyrics though"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"Are still referencing what he was singing"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Oh really?"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Yeah"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"Something about the lions sleeping tonight"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"You got some info?"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Are lions in the jungle? I don't think they are"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"What do you mean?"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"They're on the savannah, they're not in the jungle"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"You're on some Neil deGrasse Tyson shit right now"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"I associate lions with the Serengeti plains of Kenya"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"I don't associate them with like"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"Is there not jungle parts of the savannah?"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"No"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"There's not like a"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Dense groups of trees?"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"Jungle is like rainforest"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Where like gorillas live"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"You know what I mean?"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Kind of"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Anyway, I'm nitpicking here"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"No I know what you mean, but I feel like sometimes"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"When you're watching a nature program"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"You'll see the lion out there hunting"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"And it gets so gnarly"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Like the picture, the lion's face covered in blood"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Lion might hunt a gazelle"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"An antelope, something of that nature"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Out on the savannah"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"But then don't they drag it back into like the brush?"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"That's not the jungle though"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"It's radically different ecosystems"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"Is it time for a cat to get a number crunch on that?"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"You know what I'm reading about is that"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Lions are referred to as the king of the jungle"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"But Jake is correct, they don't actually live in the jungle"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"And there's kind of this long winded"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"There's a Guardian article I'm on about"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Thank God the Guardian wrote an article about this"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"Yeah it has to do with semantics"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"And jungle being a Hindi word"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"That means not an inhabited place"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"And you know"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"It's going to be boring for me to go through all this"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"I gotcha"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"But to everybody listening to TC"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"Which is a major information source"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"News, culture, things of that nature"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"That's a pretty good actually"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"To have in your arsenal"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Well actually jungle in Hindi means"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Well that's a good one too, I actually didn't know that"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Undeveloped terrain"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"I just mean like that's a good mix of an incredibly common thing that people say"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Lion is the king of the jungle"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Lion lives in the jungle"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"And it's also pretty good actually"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Lions don't live in the jungle"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"If I could just plug the Time Crisis Twitter"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"If you check us out I'll link to the article"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"And then you can follow us at"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Time Crisis 2000"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"On Twitter"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Very popular account"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"I guess words change meanings"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Whatever it meant, uninhabited space in Hindi"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"And now we associate it more with like"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Rainforest, very dense kind of tree"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"And also even you know Savannah"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"If you're American when you hear the word Savannah"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"First thing you think of is Savannah, Georgia"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Also true"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"King of the Savannah"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"King of the Savannah doesn't have the same ring to it"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"No, King of the Plains?"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Or maybe it was as simple as whoever was writing the English language lyrics"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"They were bound by syllables"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"They had"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Da da da da"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"And they were like I'm really trying to work in"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"In the Savannah"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"And then somebody else was like just put jungle"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Who cares man, doesn't matter"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"In the Savannah"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"REM covered that song"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Oh I could totally see that"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"It's the version The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Are these two different things?"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Well it says that it was a b-side of The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Where they actually did The Lion Sleeps Tonight"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Can we hear that version?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"It's a major song"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"In the jungle"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"The quiet jungle"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"The lion sleeps tonight"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"So straight up"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Yeah, heamba"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Pretty weak, I mean I like REM but"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"I like REM but that's pretty weak"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I wonder what year that is"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Oh, this is from '91?"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"This is like out of time era"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"I mean they're having fun"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"It's not an album cut"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I'm going a little country"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Yeah, if we get a little pedal steel in there"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"It's like gonna go for the eeeeee"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"Oh there is a pedal steel in there"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Yeah, straight up, country"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Call that"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"The quiet village"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"The lion sleeps tonight"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"This feels a little bit like"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"They stopped by Sesame Street"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Right"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Well, actually Elmo"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Lions live in the savannah"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Ya moron"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"Owie owie owie owie owie"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Is that Mike Mills?"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"That's Mike Mills"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Owie owie owie owie owie"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Peter Bux is drunk like"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Do we have to do this?"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Oh"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Oh these guys are just horsing around"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"They're just horsing around"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Is that a theremin?"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"They put a lot of time into this"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"When you really think"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Solid four hours"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"That's it you think?"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"And then they had the producer put in the brass and everything"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Maybe"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"In the jungle"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"That's not a bad good stripe"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"It sounds like you're trying to do like"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Blink 182 version"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"That's way easier"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"In the mighty jungle"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"The lion sleeps tonight"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"In"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"In the jungle"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"The mighty jungle"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Oh yeah the nice harmonies"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"The lion sleeps"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Tonight"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"The ugliest sound a human voice can make"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"In the jungle"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Nah I can't do it"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Stripe has a very distinctive voice"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"But it's hard to nail an impression of"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"He's got a lot of different gears"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Don't let your slip away"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"That's not bad"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"Cause everybody"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Cries"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"I don't know why I keep going to pop funk"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"You know who would have killed that?"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Elvis"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Vegas era Elvis"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Would have destroyed that song"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Oh lion sleeps tonight?"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Actually now we gotta check is there an Elvis?"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"It's not"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Maybe Vampire Weekend should cover R.E.M"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"I'm starting to think we got some shows booked"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Oh live? Cool"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"What would you do man?"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Start thinking about good covers"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I don't know what would be like a good R.E.M"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Man on the Moon?"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"Is that too low energy?"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I mean honestly I know the world would rule"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"But you gotta commit those lyrics to memory"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Oh yeah that's a lot"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"I always liked Imitation of Life"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"I know that's like"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"That sugar cane that tasted good"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"That's Hollywood"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Come on"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"That's such an obscure"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"I mean"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"It was on MTV2 a lot"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"It's a great song but it's not like a classic"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"But that's cool you could do like a"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Late period R.E.M cover"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"A classic R.E.M just like"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Shiny happy people"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"Stand"
01:29:19;01:29:23;"Stand in the place that you live"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Think about"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Alright"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Send an email if there's a"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"You guys could kill stand"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"If there's an R.E.M song you think Vampiricans should cover"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Back to"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Our current day"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"The number three song on the iTunes chart right now"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"Is by Lil Dicky"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"You know who that is Jake?"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"I don't"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Lil Dicky is a rapper"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"I would describe him as a satirical rapper"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"But then"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"He randomly pops up in these like kind of"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Credible rap spaces which kind of confuses me"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"Credible rap spaces"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"His vibe is that he's kind of like a goofy white guy"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"And his"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Lyrics he's always rapping about"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"How he's like a dorky"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"White guy and hence and because his name is"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"Lil Dicky he's always talking about how his dick is very small"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Sounds like Hot Carl"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"A little bit"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Except this guy Lil Dicky he's actually like very popular"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"To the point"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"That he's now on the top five"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"And his newest song is called Freaky Friday"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Featuring Chris Brown"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"And the entire video"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"It's kind of like a short film"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"That's basically about Lil Dicky and Chris Brown getting in a Freaky Friday"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Scenario in which they swap bodies"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Wow"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"And Lil Dicky wakes up and he's Chris Brown he's very excited"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"And Chris Brown wakes up and he's Lil Dicky"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"And he doesn't like it but then he also kind of"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"Likes people not bothering him on the street"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"So anyway"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"I guess maybe it's going to be like a pop song"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"But it's like"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Lil Dicky"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Ooh"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"Your boy Bedsheets did this song"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Oh yeah Ed Sheeran does the cameo"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Just Chris Brown so sincerely"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Going Lil Dicky"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"His tattoos on my neck"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"I just FaceTimed Kanye"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"I told him I'm his biggest fan yeah"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Got all these s*** in my DM"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Yeah I do"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Holy s*** I got a kid"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Oh"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"I can sing so well"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"Wonder if I can say the N word"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Wait can I really say the N word"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"What up my winner"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Big ups my winner"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"We up my winner"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"So you understand what's happening here"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"I'm not sure who's who here"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"In the narrative of the song"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"So that is"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"That was Lil Dicky"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"That Lil Dicky woke up in Chris Brown's body"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Hence that's Chris Brown's voice"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"So Lil Dicky waking up in Chris Brown's body"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"And exploring what it's like to be Chris Brown"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"So Lil Dicky FaceTimed Kanye"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Now that he's in the body of Chris Brown"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"A black man"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"That's why they do this whole thing about the N word"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Right okay"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"If you didn't see the video you'd just be like"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"What the hell is going on"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"I'm surprised it's in the top 5"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"Because conceptually it's kind of weird"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"That it translates into just audio"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"I guess it is a catchy song"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Well keep listening"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"I'm that winner"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"I woke up in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"So hot it's turned into Freaky Friday"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"But we got no choice but to turn this s*** sideways"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"It's Freaky Friday"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"Driving Ferrari"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"I woke up in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"And I'm like skin black"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"And I'm like skin black"

01:33:03;01:33:05;"And I'm like skin black"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"I'm in Chris Brown's body"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"And I'm like skin black"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"If I was Chris Brown where would I be? What would I do?"
01:33:11;01:33:15;"I woke up in Chris Brown's body"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"So hot it's"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Turned into Freaky Friday"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Wait a sec, I'm so-"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"This is totally confusing me. So Chris Brown"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"is singing"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"""I woke up in Chris Brown's body"""
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Yes. So then how is that"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"the narrative of the song? It should be a little"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Dickie-singer. No, no, no, no, no."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Because... You look so frustrated."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"[laughter]"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"You know what's funny is I met one of the"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"producers of the song. I was at a party"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"and he was explaining this in detail to us"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"like three months ago. We had a conversation"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"like this. He was like, ""So then"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"you know he wakes up and he's Chris Brown"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"so he's singing the N word."" And I'm like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"You're gonna have little Dickie sing the N word?"" He's like, ""Yeah, but he's in Chris Brown's body."""
01:33:53;01:33:55;"And I was like, ""You can't have him do that."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"That's f***ed up."" He's like, ""No, it's okay."""
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Because at the time"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"I didn't fully understand. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some people"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"who still think it's not okay. But"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Jake, so you understand"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"it's Freaky Friday. You've seen the film."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"You're familiar with the concept of Freaky Friday."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"I've actually never seen the film. Are you familiar with the concept of Body Swap?"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Sure, sure."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"So,"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"in the plot of the song..."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"No, I understand."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"So, when Chris Brown sings"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"Right. It is Chris Brown's"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"body"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"and little Dickie's brain. But it..."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Okay, so imagine... Oh, I see what you're saying."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Okay. I see what you're saying."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Right, so Chris Brown's voice"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"is singing, ""I can't believe I woke up"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"in Chris Brown's body."" But that's little Dickie's"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"thought. Right."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"I made the narrative assumption"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"that it was first person."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Well, it is first person. Which is why"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"in a song it's crazy. This is so faked off."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"So, the person that's singing"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"it is... We're hearing their"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"interior monologue."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"That's what I assumed. Right. But that's not the case."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"In the video, you're actually watching these guys"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"mouth it, so it makes more sense. Right."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"It's very... No, no, you're right."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"It's three layers. It actually opens up a very"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"kind of post-modern question, which is"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"in a song,"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"what is the voice we're hearing? Are you hearing the"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"interior voice? Because you're right."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"If in the song version, we were"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"hearing the interior voice, the eternal"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"voice of little Dickie that stays with him"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"whatever body he's in,"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"then it would make more sense that we were hearing in little"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Dickie's voice. Yes, that's what I assumed."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Right. And I was thinking to myself,"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"""Wow, little Dickie actually has a pretty good voice."""
01:35:27;01:35:29;"[laughs]"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"I set it up as like, he's this dorky white guy,"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"and I'm listening to the first verse"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"thinking it's little Dickie singing."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"That was actually Chris Brown. That was Chris Brown in the"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"studio. I get it. You raised a good point though, because"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"I'm just sort of like, ""Wow, he's good."""
01:35:41;01:35:43;"But little Dickie's not a singer,"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"so would he not be rapping if he"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"was Chris Brown still? Well, because"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"they're... But I... Okay. That is true."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"I don't want to give them too much credit, but they do"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"address it because he goes,"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"he's exploring his body,"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"and his life is Chris Brown. In the video, he's looking"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"around the house, and he's looking at his body, and there's a part"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"where he goes, ""I can sing"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"so well."" Oh, that's fair."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Yeah. So it's like he's exploring his voice."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"He's excited. ""I can sing so well. I can't"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"believe it. I suddenly have this voice."""
01:36:09;01:36:11;"But it does raise the question,"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"singing is not just your vocal chords,"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"it's also the neural pathways in your brain."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Little Dickie wouldn't have access"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"to them. He wouldn't have the years of experience that"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Chris Brown had. No. It's a plot hole here. He wouldn't have his"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"memories. He would probably need a few months"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"to kind of, you know... It's like"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"sitting down in a Ferrari, but you don't know how to drive."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"He doesn't know how to drive stick shift. Yeah."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"A lot of holes in freaky driving. I'm also"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"missing a lot, you know, this kind of... This is an"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"insane song to hear without watching the"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"video. Also, first pass, we're going"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"very granular."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I didn't know this song existed."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"""I can sing so"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"well."" Imagine"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"our song that was like this."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"""I woke up in Dick's long"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"stretched body."" Well, except if I was singing,"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"""I woke up in Ezra's"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"body."""
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Oh, it's because it's my interior"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"dialogue through your vocal cords."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"The"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"DC version. Seinfeld"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"as a satirist."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Do you like this song?"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Oh, I have mixed feelings about it"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"because I actually... I appreciate"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Little Dickie and I really enjoyed his singing. Oh, really?"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"I like him. I like that ""Save That"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Money."" I have like a guilty... You know,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"I enjoy funny rap. I like"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"the Lonely Island, you know,"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Weird Al. It's not cool to admit,"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"but I like rap that's funny."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"And I really like his ""Save That Money"" video."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"I don't know if you saw that. This is the"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"concept. Again, he's very conceptual, but the"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"video is that he's trying to do like a"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"big baller rap video and"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"he's doing everything for free."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"So it opens with him like going door to door"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"in LA trying to get like mansions to shoot"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"in and he borrows a fee,"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"goes to a dealership and he gets a car"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"and he's driving it around. And I was talking to a"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"friend about this and he was like, ""You know, this is really funny."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"I don't know if I can support the rehabilitation"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"of Chris Brown."" Right, yeah."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"And there's a part in the video where"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Chris Brown, you know,"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"with the soul, I guess, of the little dick inside,"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"he discovers a gun in his own"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"house. And it's like,"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"I don't know, I'm a little on the fence about it."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Yeah, why you gotta bring guns into it?"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"But then again, will Chris Brown ever"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"be redeemable? It opens up questions"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"that are maybe worth considering."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"But, um, what was the question?"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"I can't believe that."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Next thing will be with R. Kelly."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Right? I thought the Ed Sheeran and"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Kendall Jenner stuff at the end was pretty funny."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Oh, so Ed comes in. Well then at the end,"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"they break the curse."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Okay. They go back into their bodies"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"but then there's like this kind of"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"sting ending where then"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"he flips into a few other people's bodies."
01:38:35;01:38:37;"So he's in DJ Khaled's body, then he's in Ed Sheeran's"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"body. And when he's Ed Sheeran he goes like,"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"""I'm in Ed Sheeran's body."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"This isn't as cool as being in"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Chris Brown's body."" And then he's"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"in Kendall Jenner's body and so on."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"How's Kendall work out for him? Let's play it."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Let's see if it's in it."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"I think that's Kendall Jenner actually singing. Oh yeah."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"That's funny. That's funny."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"That's straight up. It's like an SNL skit"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"It's like a skit basically."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Yeah exactly."
01:39:15;01:39:16;"I mean, exactly."
01:39:16;01:39:18;"When you watch the video you'll understand it's an SNL sketch."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Wow."
01:39:19;01:39:23;"The one thing that I'll say about it is the chorus to me is so funny that it's, because"
01:39:23;01:39:27;"it's like a real, these are like real pop dudes, real writers in that."
01:39:27;01:39:31;"""I woke up in Chris Brown's body."
01:39:31;01:39:35;"So hot as shit, turned into Freaky Friday."
01:39:35;01:39:40;"But we got no choice but to turn this shit sideways."
01:39:40;01:39:45;"I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:39:45;01:39:52;"Something about the earnest delivery of ""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Just like, because the other parts they know they're being, it's like they're being silly"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"and shit."
01:39:55;01:40:03;"And I just love that he very earnestly delivers ""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Just sings it so well."
01:40:05;01:40:14;"And just, also, just that line, ""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:14;01:40:17;"You're right, Seinfeld, there's some thorny issues that maybe we'll get into if it stays"
01:40:17;01:40:21;"in the top five, but they accomplished something here."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"Also you know what I find that's so funny is like, imagine that it actually happened"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"and that you're like, ""Holy shit, I'm in somebody else's body."""
01:40:28;01:40:31;"And then you just like look in the mirror and you say, ""I can't believe that it's Freaky"
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Friday."""
01:40:32;01:40:36;"I don't know why I find that, that to me is the funniest part of the song."
01:40:36;01:40:42;"It's like Freaky Friday is like a fairly common occurrence that like is frequent enough."
01:40:42;01:40:48;"The tone of the song is not ""Holy shit, everything I understand about science and reality is,"""
01:40:48;01:40:53;"it's more just like, ""Oh, I forgot it was Memorial Day."""
01:40:53;01:40:55;"I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."
01:40:55;01:41:00;"Or yes, it turns like, ""Oh, today's Valentine's Day, I can't believe it."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"I got to go buy my girlfriend something."""
01:41:03;01:41:05;"This is a very interesting top five in 1972."
01:41:05;01:41:08;"So far we had Paul Simon, Mother and Child Reunion."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"Epic top five."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"And we had Donny Osmond and Robert John."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"And now number two, the number two song."
01:41:13;01:41:17;"Imagine this, that this was a big hit song in 1972."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"The epitome of the tasteful palette of the 70s."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Number two song 1972."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Nice."
01:41:23;01:41:30;"That's just one of those songs that everybody kind of likes."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"It's a classic, but it's not cheesy."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"It's..."
01:41:33;01:41:43;"Hey, Seinfeld, you'll appreciate this."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"What's up?"
01:41:44;01:41:49;"Neil Young was the first Canadian to have a number one album with Harvest in April '72"
01:41:49;01:41:50;"on the Billboard 200."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"Oh, wow."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"That's surprising."
01:41:52;01:41:56;"I mean, what Canadians were popping before Neil?"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Joni?"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Joni."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"But was that pre-Neil?"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Yeah, well, yeah."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"The blue was '71."
01:42:01;01:42:10;"Oh, what about Paul Anka, who we referenced?"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"He's not, he's not Canadian, is he?"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"I feel like we've had this conversation before."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"I know he's..."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"About Paul Anka being Canadian?"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I think he's Lebanese American."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"He's a Canadian American according to Wikipedia."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"He was born, yeah, he was born in Ottawa, Ontario."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"To Lebanese immigrant parents?"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Uh, sure."
01:42:28;01:42:29;"Yeah, all right."
01:42:29;01:42:34;"But he made, probably wouldn't have had a number one album."
01:42:34;01:42:42;"Yeah."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"I guess one thing we could just say is like, this is a classic song, everybody knows it."
01:42:46;01:42:47;"What's it really about, Jake?"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"What's your interpretation?"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"I've never thought about it really."
01:42:51;01:43:03;"I've been a miner for a heart of gold."
01:43:03;01:43:17;"What a cool voice."
01:43:17;01:43:19;"He's just looking for a good person."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"He's just looking for somebody he could trust."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Yeah maybe."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"He feels like a miner, except he's not mining for real gold."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"He's mining for a heart of gold."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"I like it."
01:43:27;01:43:32;"Keeps me searching for a heart of gold."
01:43:32;01:43:39;"And I'm getting old."
01:43:39;01:43:47;"The number two song back in 2018, Bebe Rexha featuring FGL."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"Oh my God."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"This song won't die, man."
01:43:51;01:43:55;"I don't know if you guys follow Bebe on Twitter."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"I don't."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"She's been catching some flack."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Oh really?"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"For doing a country song and she's been defending herself."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"Who's given her flack?"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Like just fans."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"Country fans?"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Country fans."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Oh."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Yeah."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"That's a whack vibe."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Yeah."
01:44:08;01:44:16;"If this is what counts as a country song, then everybody's got to chill."
01:44:16;01:44:38;"I get the impression this was a bigger song than they expected it was going to be."
01:44:38;01:44:39;"Oh yeah."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Massive."
01:44:40;01:44:47;"I woke up in a country singer's body."
01:44:47;01:44:54;"I'm just a pop singer from New York and now I'm singing with somebody called Florida,"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"Georgia line."
01:44:55;01:44:58;"Well, I'm confused too."
01:44:58;01:45:02;"Jake, your hold up girl is very popular on Twitter."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"What do you mean?"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"I don't know."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"You did like hold up girl last time, but it was like, it's the thing now."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"Oh, like hold up."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Yeah."
01:45:09;01:45:14;"Oh wait, because the guy's like took a clip from the show."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"I don't know."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"The guy sings it in the song."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Yeah."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"People were quoting you and stuff."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"That's hilarious."
01:45:20;01:45:24;"That's so hilarious to listen to this like pop trap country song and be like, how dare"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"you try to sing country?"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Ms. Rexa."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"How dare you pop trap country?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Let's not forget the auto tune element."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Pop trap auto tune country."
01:45:36;01:45:42;"How dare you steal the 16th note high hat patterns of traditional country music."
01:45:42;01:45:48;"Ms. Rexa, the booming 808 bass drums of country music."
01:45:48;01:45:52;"People like Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings."
01:45:52;01:46:01;"They worked and fought to imbue Southern music with booming 808 bass drums and program snaps."
01:46:01;01:46:05;"And Ms. Rexa, you New York City girl coming."
01:46:05;01:46:11;"Did Bebe Rexa's fans also give her shit because she probably already lose them all."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"I think it's cool."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"I think they were standing up for her."
01:46:14;01:46:17;"You know, did you stand up for your big Bebe Rexa fan?"
01:46:17;01:46:18;"Yeah."
01:46:18;01:46:24;"You know, well, we're following her on Twitter, the time crisis, you know, time, time, time"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"crisis, every, every once in a while."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Oh, nice."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Yeah."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"Does she have a show on Apple music on beats one?"
01:46:30;01:46:33;"I wonder if she knows about the crisis."
01:46:33;01:46:37;"I don't, you know, unlikely we can never have her on the show."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"You would melt."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"You'd be a blubbering mess."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"You're too big of a fan."
01:46:40;01:46:43;"I don't want to think about what would happen if we did."
01:46:43;01:46:44;"Is Bebe Rexa her real name?"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"I'd keep it together."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"I think it is."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Let's see."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"Keep it together."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"Bebe Rexa."
01:46:49;01:46:54;"Oh, she is Bleta quote Bebe Rexa."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"Oh, that's what kind of name is that?"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"Bleta."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"Um, you'd think I'd know Albanian."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"That's sick."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"Albanian and Kosovar heritage these days."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Do a lip of Bebe Rexa Rita Ora."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"Action Bronson."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"Shout out to people from that area."
01:47:11;01:47:16;"I woke up in a country singer's body this week in 1972."
01:47:16;01:47:21;"The number two song was heart of gold and the number one song was this."
01:47:21;01:47:23;"Wow."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"So this was just the wave."
01:47:25;01:47:29;"These kind of like minor key acoustic."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"I was assuming the song was just ripping off Neil Young."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"Oh yeah, absolutely."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"What else is there to assume?"
01:47:34;01:47:45;"But it came out the same time as his biggest hit."
01:47:45;01:47:52;"So maybe to some extent it was sort of like the house style of the day."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"But Neil has a pretty distinctive voice."
01:47:54;01:47:57;"They got some shit for it."
01:47:57;01:48:09;"Some radio stations banned it because they believe that a horse was slang for heroin."
01:48:09;01:48:12;"But then the singer from America said, it's not about drugs."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"It's about the things I saw when I was visiting the United States."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"Cause they're like English or something."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"Wait, I thought they're not American."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"I think they're, you know what?"
01:48:21;01:48:26;"I think they're American like army brats who grew up in England."
01:48:26;01:48:33;"So they're growing up in England, basking in the warm tones of SoCal country rock."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"Wow."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"So they have like English accents and stuff?"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"I don't know."
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Yeah."
01:48:39;01:48:43;"All their dads are stationed at a US Air Force base near London and they went to high school"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"in London."
01:48:44;01:48:51;"I mean, I guess it's sort of like if you like got the top five from like 92, it was like"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"Pearl Jam and then like Stone Temple Pilots."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Right."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"Yeah."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Is Scott Weiland ripping off Eddie Vedder?"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"I don't know."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Kind of."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"Or maybe that's just the wave."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"That's just kind of the sound of the era."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"That's just the wave."
01:49:04;01:49:08;"I woke up in Neil Young's body."
01:49:08;01:49:13;"I can't believe it's Freaky Friday."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"You know what's cool about Freaky Friday?"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"Lil Dicky and Chris Brown, they could keep making Freaky Fridays."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"They could do historical Freaky Fridays."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Oh yeah."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"Neil Young and Joni Mitchell have a Freaky Friday."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"Chris Brown and Lil Dicky do Neil Young and Joni Mitchell."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Well, I'm just saying they could like, they could produce it."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Oh, I see."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"They could do Freaky Fridays throughout history."
01:49:32;01:49:36;"You know, like there's those guys who used to make the epic rap battles of history."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"Be like Einstein is, you know, rapping against-"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"I don't think I know that."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"Wow."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Bill Gates, Steve Jobs."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"That was a big one."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"Yeah."
01:49:44;01:49:46;"So you could do Freaky Fridays throughout history."
01:49:46;01:49:50;"Napoleon wakes up in the Duke of Wellington's body."
01:49:50;01:49:56;"The number one song back in our era, 2018, Ben Platt and Lin-Manuel Miranda."
01:49:56;01:49:59;"Jake, do you know who those people are?"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I know who Lin-Manuel Miranda is."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Prove it."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"I don't know who Ben Platt is."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Who is Lin-Manuel Miranda?"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"He wrote Hamilton."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Right."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"Don't forget about In the Heights."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Fake fan."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Oh, never heard of it."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"And I know he was on season 10 of Curb."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"That's right."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"As himself."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"That's right."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"Ben Platt is also a giant of musical theater."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"Okay."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"He's the star of Dear Evan Hansen."
01:50:24;01:50:25;"Have you heard of that?"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"Mm-mm."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Have you?"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"Yeah, I've heard of it."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"It's a major Broadway musical right now."
01:50:30;01:50:35;"And he won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical."
01:50:35;01:50:39;"This is like Jay-Z and Kanye coming together on Watch the Throne."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"Right."
01:50:40;01:50:44;"It's called Found Tonight, and it's a mashup of two Broadway musical numbers."
01:50:44;01:50:48;"Hamilton's the story of tonight, a song you of course are familiar with as someone who's"
01:50:48;01:50:52;"seen Hamilton, and Dear Evan Hansen's You Will Be Found."
01:50:52;01:50:58;"And this is a benefit single raising money for the survivors of the high school shooting"
01:50:58;01:50:59;"in Florida."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Okay."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"So you can't say anything bad about it."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Nope."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"This is for a good cause."
01:51:04;01:51:10;"We may not yet have reached our glory, but I will gladly join the fight."
01:51:10;01:51:21;"And when our children tell their story, they'll tell the story of tonight."
01:51:21;01:51:28;"They'll tell the story of tonight."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"What's Dear Evan Hansen about?"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Seinfeld, do you know what Dear Evan Hansen's about?"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"I'm hearing about it for the first time now."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"You've never even heard of it?"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"No."
01:51:36;01:51:40;"Oh wait, is it the one about like bullying or something and the guy-"
01:51:40;01:51:43;"Is it like he writes letters?"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"You know what, I think I do know this actually."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"Is that why it's called Dear Evan Hansen?"
01:51:46;01:51:47;"Yeah."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"It's writing letters to a bully?"
01:51:48;01:51:52;"Is this the guy who gets like panic attacks or something?"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"It's a bully who gets panic attacks."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"Oh wait, oh!"
01:51:56;01:51:57;"Yeah."
01:51:57;01:52:03;"Evan Hansen is a high school senior who suffers from social anxiety disorder, which inhibits"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"his ability to connect with other people."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"And?"
01:52:07;01:52:08;"And make friends."
01:52:08;01:52:12;"It's a whole story."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"He gets over it?"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"He goes on meds?"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"What happens?"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"I'm not going to ruin the musical for people."
01:52:18;01:52:21;"Why didn't Lin-Manuel, like they could have Freaky Friday'd the shit out of this."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Why didn't they?"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"They could have switched it up."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"That's true."
01:52:24;01:52:29;"No matter what they tell you, someone will come running to take you."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"It's Alexander Hamilton."
01:52:30;01:52:38;"I can't believe I woke up in Alexander Hamilton's body."
01:52:38;01:52:44;"I'm just a high school student from the modern era."
01:52:44;01:52:48;"And then Alexander Hamilton wakes up in Dear Evan Hansen's body."
01:52:48;01:52:59;"I can't believe I woke up in Dear Evan Hansen's body."
01:52:59;01:53:03;"I know we'd appreciate this more if we were more familiar with the source material."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Musicals are popping."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Musicals might be bigger than movies right now."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"I don't like that."
01:53:08;01:53:09;"Why?"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I don't like musicals."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"What about what they call jukebox musicals?"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"What's that?"
01:53:14;01:53:19;"That's when they take the catalog of a classic artist, like a Billy Joel or a Queen."
01:53:19;01:53:22;"Like Jersey Boys?"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Is Jersey Boys considered a jukebox musical?"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"I would say so based on that description."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"But Jersey Boys is telling the story of the group."
01:53:28;01:53:33;"There's even a step beyond, like Jimmy Buffett's about to roll one out, where you use the classic"
01:53:33;01:53:38;"songs of an artist and then you write a story just around it."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Mamma Mia."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"Yeah, like Mamma Mia."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"Whose work is that?"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"ABBA."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Oh, really?"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Classic Tom Craze's favorite."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Like Mamma Mia with Meryl Streep and stuff?"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Mamma Mia, here I go again."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"Oh, I didn't realize."
01:53:50;01:53:53;"They do like Dancing Queen in it."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"Oh, I didn't realize it was that."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"ABBA's perfect for that."
01:53:55;01:54:00;"ABBA has so many incredible songs, so they chose to make a musical in conjunction with"
01:54:00;01:54:03;"the main ABBA people."
01:54:03;01:54:07;"And rather than saying, ""Well, let's do a musical about the early days of ABBA and how"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"we got together,"" they said, ""No, no, no, f*** that."
01:54:08;01:54:15;"We're going to do a musical about a girl who's coming to Greece to get married and hang out"
01:54:15;01:54:19;"with her hippie-dippie mom, and then she asks her mom who her real father is and it gets"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"confusing."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"So it's about a wedding and it's in Greece and it's fun."""
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Gotcha."
01:54:24;01:54:27;"So they said that when they sing the songs, they'll sing like The Winner Takes It All"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"at a tender moment."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"""The winner takes it all."""
01:54:31;01:54:34;"They'll sing Dancing Queen where everybody's dancing and trying to cheer up."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"I gotcha."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Jukebox musicals."
01:54:36;01:54:39;"Yeah, so you could do one for the Eagles."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"So for instance, I'm sure that somebody at some point started developing one."
01:54:42;01:54:47;"So if there was an Eagles jukebox musical, and it wouldn't shock me-"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Desperado."
01:54:48;01:54:53;"Literally, it would be like they'd create a character and his name's like Randy Ortega,"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"just moved to California."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Sings New Kid in Town."
01:54:57;01:55:02;"""There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar."""
01:55:02;01:55:08;"And then at some point he meets a girl and he likes her, but then he goes down to the"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"cafe and he sees her."
01:55:10;01:55:14;"Or no, there's a girl he really likes, but she's married to this sh*tty rich dude."
01:55:14;01:55:19;"""You can't hide your lying eyes."""
01:55:19;01:55:22;"At some point it'd be like Hotel California."
01:55:22;01:55:28;"This would be the part in the third act where she's like, ""Randy, you've changed."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"You're a rock star now."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"You don't care."
01:55:31;01:55:34;"Look at you staying here at the Chateau Marmont with all your drugs and your women."""
01:55:34;01:55:37;"She's like, ""Come on, leave with me now."""
01:55:37;01:55:39;"""I can't leave, babe."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"Get out of here."""
01:55:40;01:55:45;"She's like, ""You can check out, but you can never leave."""
01:55:45;01:55:52;"And then he's like, ""All alone at the end of the evening."""
01:55:52;01:55:57;"And then he stays up all night doing coke and he's drinking as the sun rises."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"""It's another tequila sunrise."""
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Oh yeah, you know what?"
01:56:02;01:56:03;"It's back to back."
01:56:03;01:56:08;"He has his Hotel California moment where that shows that now he's entered this new phase"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"of his life."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"You could picture the cast in musicals."
01:56:12;01:56:16;"It's always the general players would come up to him with their arms like, ""Plenty of"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"room at the Hotel California."""
01:56:19;01:56:21;"He's really enticed by it."
01:56:21;01:56:25;"And then finally he takes the plunge and then he's straight up doing coke."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"""Mirrors on the ceiling."""
01:56:27;01:56:30;"And then he's just straight up, ""Pink champagne on ice."""
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Laughing in the fast lane."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"But then he has a crazy night and he's loving it."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"And then he wakes up and it's a tequila sunrise."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"And then his redemption song is maybe ""Desperado."""
01:56:40;01:56:41;"""Desperado."""
01:56:41;01:56:44;"Maybe it's about his buddy."
01:56:44;01:56:50;"The Glenn Frey character is just like, ""I accomplished my wildest dreams, but at what"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"cost, man?"""
01:56:51;01:56:52;"Glenn's like, ""Yeah, man."
01:56:52;01:56:54;"Time for you to come to your senses."""
01:56:54;01:56:56;"He's like, ""I just don't know if I can."""
01:56:56;01:56:57;"He's like, ""Yeah, you can, man."""
01:56:57;01:56:58;"""You've been out riding."""
01:56:58;01:56:59;"What is the lyrics?"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"""You've been out riding fences."""
01:57:00;01:57:01;"It's ""You've been out riding fences."""
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Something."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"I think it is."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"Yeah."
01:57:04;01:57:10;"And then the final, final closing number to just go out with is, ""Take it easy."""
01:57:10;01:57:14;"Yeah, he and the girl get back together."
01:57:14;01:57:20;"""Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy."""
01:57:20;01:57:23;"What do you guys see in this movie?"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"Just out of curiosity."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Well, we're going to workshop it in San Diego first."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"This is basically just like an Eagles biopic at this point."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"Kind of."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"Yeah, it's like thinly, loosely based on the..."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"Who would play kind of like the main dude, the Randy?"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"I guess it'd have to be like some young up and comer."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"Oh, ""Call Me By Your Name,"" the..."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"Chalamet?"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"Chalamet, right?"
01:57:41;01:57:42;"That's what he is like."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"Sure."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"His mainstream breakout."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Yeah, if he could sing."
01:57:45;01:57:46;"Sure."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"""Don't let the sound of your..."""
01:57:47;01:57:48;"But it's like this really cheesy..."
01:57:48;01:57:53;"""Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy."""
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Like the Glee version, basically."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Yeah, basically."
01:57:56;01:58:01;"""Timothy Chalamet is Don Henley."
01:58:01;01:58:08;"Robert Pattinson as Timothy B. Schmidt as Randy Meisner."""
01:58:08;01:58:10;"There's also a version where the main character..."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"This would be like some rock opera type..."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"Like doesn't have a name."
01:58:13;01:58:17;"It'd be like, ""Robert Pattinson as the Drifter."""
01:58:17;01:58:18;"They never say his name."
01:58:18;01:58:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:58:19;01:58:20;"And then there's also the kid."
01:58:20;01:58:21;"The kid."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"As the kid."
01:58:22;01:58:23;"Great idea."
01:58:23;01:58:24;"Well, that's our top five."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"Hell of a show."
01:58:25;01:58:26;"We came up with $2 billion ideas."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"I feel like you went with like five."
01:58:27;01:58:28;"Yeah."
01:58:28;01:58:29;"I don't even remember what we..."
01:58:29;01:58:30;"We came up with $5 billion worth of ideas on today's show."
01:58:30;01:58:31;"Any lawyers who want to help out, you know the email, 8minutecapecod."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"It's spelled out right, E-I-G-H-T-E-N."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"No, it's the numeral eight."
01:58:33;01:58:34;"Oh, sorry."
01:58:34;01:58:35;"I lost it."
