09:56;10:00;"you're gonna fall"
10:00;10:05;"okay so back to Zeb while I was listening to the song my favorite of the"
10:05;10:09;"new singles by the way thank you Zeb I think that's an all-time VW myself I"
10:09;10:14;"became curious about the etymology of the term while my degree is in biology"
10:14;10:20;"and chemistry class of 2017 a buff tight 8 if there ever was one tight 8 do you"
10:20;10:26;"not remember tight 8 no what's that that came from TC man oh okay so clearly this"
10:26;10:30;"is the linguistics episode tight 8 is a phrase that has its origin on the"
10:30;10:36;"American Internet radio show time crisis I believe we were talking about that a"
10:36;10:40;"tight 8 is when you're four years of high school and you're four years of"
10:40;10:44;"college although we didn't want to be elitist so I think we almost said it"
10:44;10:50;"could also just count whatever age 14 to 22 but those eight years of like early"
10:50;10:55;"adulthood into it whatever you want to call that transition teen dude teenage"
10:55;10:59;"years teenage years well no because then you get your early 20s to you know your"
10:59;11:04;"mm-hmm your high school years into your 14 to 22 is a hell of a yeah jump that's"
11:04;11:08;"a big one but those incredibly transformative eight years we were"
11:08;11:14;"saying that if you are blessed to have all eight of those years in the same"
11:14;11:19;"decade you my friend had a tight 8 oh okay talked about it because Jake you"
11:19;11:27;"had a tight 8 and I did not 91 to 99 I mean yeah you're just like king of the"
11:27;11:32;"90s yeah dude just high school into college all 90s hell yeah dude"
11:32;11:38;"whereas mines random as hell I entered high school 98 and exited 2006 you"
11:38;11:43;"entered in and left in different worlds from Clinton to Bush yeah it was all"
11:43;11:47;"over 9/11 dude I think maybe when we had that conversation about the tight it I"
11:47;11:51;"was saying like I was kind of glad I went to high school and college in such"
11:51;11:55;"a random time because I was you know like I just like checked out yeah well"
11:55;11:58;"actually I guess you could answer that question because we're exactly eight"
11:58;12:03;"years in apart seven I think well what year were you 77 over seven yeah right"
12:03;12:10;"cuz now days between the days between our 1977 to 84 the only years when Jake"
12:10;12:14;"and I were not on the planet together that's TC cannon there'll be another"
12:14;12:18;"that's TC can in the days between there's I'm sad to say there's gonna be"
12:18;12:25;"a second days between yeah the years in between our deaths oh my god unless we"
12:25;12:29;"die together I'll be kind of beautiful in a weird way yeah and they're"
12:29;12:33;"officially is only one days between the TC camping trip goes off the rails"
12:33;12:37;"god they never came back man I was up in the middle of the night last night I"
12:37;12:42;"felt the earthquake oh really yeah there was an earthquake last night I was not"
12:42;12:45;"aware I don't think it would have woken me up if I wasn't already awake but I"
12:45;12:48;"was kind of staring at the ceiling and then I just felt like the house like"
12:48;12:52;"lurch damn I was like whoa is that like the house settling or did something fall"
12:52;12:55;"on the roof and then I was like oh yeah I forgot I'm in LA see sometimes I get"
12:55;12:59;"stressed about that because all like the real Angelino's that I know they have"
12:59;13:02;"these traumatic memories of the Northridge earthquake and they they"
13:02;13:06;"remember stuff from school and like you know well they used to tell us we should"
13:06;13:08;"go in the doorframe but now they say go and look you whatever all this stuff and"
13:08;13:12;"I was just like realized like I don't know the basics in the same way it's"
13:12;13:15;"hard for me to imagine what would happen anyways I wake up in the middle of the"
13:15;13:19;"night I hear the house lurch broadly grab my phone and I look at Twitter and"
13:19;13:23;"search earthquake Cardi B happened to be up in LA so she tweeted about it very"
13:23;13:28;"cool and then I see somebody tweet about some kind of like weird earthquake"
13:28;13:31;"predictor guy and they were all freaked out because he's been predicting a big"
13:31;13:35;"one right around now and most scientists would say you can't predict earthquakes"
13:35;13:39;"and this is a dude who's like I swear you can and so some people are into him"
13:39;13:44;"imagine if between the today's taping and when this airs that there's a giant"
13:44;13:48;"earthquake and we died on the same time well at least we reminded people about"
13:48;13:52;"the days between back to the email this is gonna take like an hour and a half to"
13:52;13:55;"get through this email that's what we're banking the EPS yeah I was fortunate"
13:55;13:58;"enough to take a few linguistics courses at school and I've been fascinated by"
13:58;14:02;"the subject ever since an exhaustive 90-second Google search left me with no"
14:02;14:09;"recorded definition of buff adjective that fit its usage on TC UW unbearably"
14:09;14:12;"white or my own conversations I therefore have to speculate on the"
14:12;14:16;"etymology because you're hitting up Kyle we're just trying to establish the chain"
14:16;14:20;"of who told who that doesn't really help with the etymology my first hypothesis"
14:20;14:25;"for the etymology of buff is that it is a portmanteau of brutal and rough that's"
14:25;14:28;"crossed my mind actually too because when I was writing unbearably white"
14:28;14:31;"there's a part of me that's like you know this song it's like a fairly"
14:31;14:36;"serious song does the word buff take people too much out of it and I was like"
14:36;14:41;"I like that mix of tones but of course I thought it'd be very easy to say"
14:41;14:45;"unbearably rough or unbearably tough I was like those would go down a lot"
14:45;14:48;"easier nobody and I was like no buff just sounds better it's cool so rough"
14:48;14:52;"crossed my mind I was like oh yeah rough tough and buff all rhyme that can't be a"
14:52;14:56;"coincidence so could it be a portmanteau of brutal and rough and for people who"
14:56;14:58;"don't know although I think it's probably pretty obvious a portmanteau is"
14:58;15:02;"a word that combines a couple what are some of the classic port I mean the word"
15:02;15:06;"portmanteau is a portmanteau in French Seinfeld what are some classic portmanteaus"
15:06;15:11;"oh man off the top of my head I'm not sure but let me crunch those numbers"
15:11;15:15;"number here I think this is my first number crunch it's coming back good to"
15:15;15:20;"have you back thank you banking the eps and crunching the numbs"
15:20;15:22;"Oh"
15:22;15:24;"go to bed again"
15:28;15:30;"when I get up"
15:30;15:32;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
15:32;15:34;"go to bed again"
15:38;15:40;"I could watch some TV"
15:40;15:42;"maybe"
15:42;15:44;"I could go under my covers and hide"
15:44;15:46;"out the window"
15:46;15:48;"and I could"
15:48;15:50;"go to bed again"
15:50;15:52;"out the window"
15:52;15:54;"bluebirds singing"
15:54;15:56;"those bluebirds"
15:56;15:58;"ain't on my"
15:58;16:00;"side"
16:00;16:02;"when I get up"
16:02;16:04;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
16:04;16:06;"go to bed again"
16:10;16:12;"when I get up"
16:12;16:14;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
16:14;16:16;"go to bed again"
16:22;16:24;"if I go back"
16:24;16:26;"to my"
16:26;16:28;"dreamland"
16:28;16:30;"you might be"
16:30;16:32;"waiting for me"
16:32;16:34;"that's where"
16:34;16:36;"I know I'm"
16:36;16:38;"wanted"
16:38;16:40;"that's where I"
16:40;16:42;"want to be"
16:42;16:44;"guitar solo"
16:46;16:48;"oh"
16:48;16:50;"guitar solo"
16:58;17:00;"when I get up"
17:00;17:02;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:02;17:04;"go to bed again"
17:06;17:08;"guitar solo"
17:08;17:10;"when I get up"
17:10;17:12;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:12;17:14;"go to bed again"
17:16;17:18;"when I get up"
17:18;17:20;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:20;17:22;"go to bed again"
17:28;17:30;"alright, oh"
17:30;17:32;"classic one from pop culture, Brangelina"
17:32;17:34;"oh yeah, so all those couple names"
17:34;17:36;"oh sure, yeah, Glamping"
17:36;17:38;"Glamour and Camping"
17:38;17:40;"Mansplaining"
17:40;17:42;"ok, I've seen people get into"
17:42;17:44;"I'm about to mansplain that to you"
17:44;17:46;"fellas, no we're, ok"
17:46;17:48;"I'm mansplaining to you"
17:48;17:50;"I have also seen people like question if it's"
17:50;17:52;"a true portmanteau if one of the words"
17:52;17:54;"is entirely contained within"
17:54;17:56;"cause like the thing about glamping"
17:56;17:58;"is that you don't get the whole part of"
17:58;18:00;"glamour and you don't get the whole camping, whereas with"
18:00;18:02;"mansplaining you get the whole man"
18:02;18:04;"I don't know what the definition is"
18:04;18:06;"it's kind of maybe just like a less"
18:06;18:08;"smooth portmanteau, it's like an imperfect rhyme"
18:08;18:10;"well mansplaining is weird cause it's a noun and a verb"
18:10;18:12;"it doesn't quite, Brangelina"
18:12;18:14;"has Brad in it, no no"
18:14;18:16;"it's Brangelina, well Angelina"
18:16;18:18;"oh yeah you're right, it has Angelina in it"
18:18;18:20;"ok, Brangelina, we're throwing that one out"
18:20;18:22;"Glamping is a good one, keep going"
18:22;18:24;"what are some like real pure ones, Mockumentary"
18:24;18:26;"we got Mock in here, we got Mock"
18:26;18:28;"Metrosexual, you got"
18:28;18:30;"both, no cause that's metropolitan"
18:30;18:32;"I think I lost the plot here, I don't know what the distinction"
18:32;18:34;"is here, whatever, what are we"
18:34;18:36;"losing or retaining?"
18:36;18:38;"part"
18:38;18:40;"there's no complete word, it's"
18:40;18:42;"a true, one part of one word"
18:42;18:44;"it's a true mix em up, one part of the other word"
18:44;18:46;"combined it's a new word"
18:46;18:48;"you know what the classic American one is, it's very LA"
18:48;18:50;"Smog, Fog and what's"
18:50;18:52;"Smog, Smoke"
18:52;18:54;"oh Smoke, Spork"
18:54;18:56;"Spoon and Fork"
18:56;18:58;"Smog's good, Smog is a good one"
18:58;19:00;"Smog is a"
19:00;19:02;"small frog, you could have a lot of fun with"
19:02;19:04;"that too, that'd be an imaginative"
19:04;19:06;"game to maybe play in a car ride"
19:06;19:08;"making up fake backstories for"
19:08;19:10;"portmanteaus, get it trending"
19:10;19:12;"used to run down to the creek with my little brother"
19:12;19:14;"and catch smogs, something like that"
19:14;19:16;"let me, I want to get a couple more portmanteaus"
19:16;19:18;"Workaholic, I was loving"
19:18;19:20;"these portmanteaus, Work and"
19:20;19:22;"Alcoholic, ok, Shopaholic"
19:22;19:24;"I guess that's like Workaholic but with"
19:24;19:26;"Spanglish, that's a true portmanteau"
19:26;19:28;"Spanish and English"
19:28;19:30;"you know also I think if we talked"
19:30;19:32;"about this on the show, in LA there's a lot of"
19:32;19:34;"portmanteaus of intersections"
19:34;19:36;"like the Wiltern Theater's at the"
19:36;19:38;"corner of Wilshire and Western"
19:38;19:40;"what else? you know there's like a Whole Foods in"
19:40;19:42;"West Hollywood, that's at the corner of"
19:42;19:44;"Santa Monica and Fairfax and that shopping"
19:44;19:46;"plaza is called Sanfair"
19:46;19:48;"not as smooth as Wiltern"
19:48;19:50;"right, oh here's one that you don't realize is a portmanteau"
19:50;19:52;"Bionic, Biology"
19:52;19:54;"and uh, Electronic"
19:54;19:56;"oh you know we forgot the most obvious"
19:56;19:58;"one of all, man, I'm disappointed in us"
19:58;20:00;"yeah? Brunch"
20:00;20:02;"oh dude, that is"
20:02;20:04;"the truest portmanteau, I think the two"
20:04;20:06;"I do think the two all time classics are"
20:06;20:08;"Brunch and Smog"
20:08;20:10;"they're concise, oh here's one we don't even"
20:10;20:12;"remember, if you listen to portmanteau"
20:12;20:14;"talk, presented by Time Crisis"
20:14;20:16;"new podcast, new podcast"
20:16;20:18;"sometimes there's these old ones that we don't even"
20:18;20:20;"know are portmanteaus"
20:20;20:22;"because they were so purely, they became"
20:22;20:24;"such a thing, how about this one"
20:24;20:26;"you ready for this? you guys sitting down"
20:26;20:28;"glitz"
20:28;20:32;"ritz? glamour and"
20:32;20:34;"ritz, you know, putting on the ritz"
20:34;20:36;"but there's also glitz and glamour"
20:36;20:38;"so it's kind of redundant, well it's like"
20:38;20:40;"ATM machine, the"

22:46;22:48;"every day you surf this thing"

22:58;23:00;"try again, was either of those words right?"
23:00;23:02;"yes, the network was right"
23:02;23:04;"you're very close, and the funny thing is"
23:04;23:06;"is that I bet some people would actually"
23:06;23:08;"dispute and say that you're right"
23:08;23:10;"in fact, I actually think you probably are right"
23:10;23:12;"this website says it's international network"
23:12;23:14;"ok, kind of a"
23:14;23:16;"name name"
23:16;23:18;"ok, and just because we're having so much"
23:18;23:20;"fun, we're spicing it"
23:20;23:22;"up this week on PC, and because"
23:22;23:24;"we just lost all of our listeners"
23:24;23:26;"we gotta take it back to music, so we'll end with"
23:26;23:28;"a music one, rockabilly"
23:28;23:30;"rock and roll plus hillbilly"
23:30;23:32;"ok, it's a type of popular"

23:40;23:42;"even urbane teenagers"
23:42;23:44;"all over, around the world"
23:44;23:46;"from Paris to Munich to New York"
23:46;23:48;"City were interested in hillbillies"
23:48;23:50;"and the type of rock and roll they"
23:50;23:52;"performed. Could buff"
23:52;23:54;"be added to this illustrious"
23:54;23:56;"list? I don't know"
23:56;23:58;"back to the email"
23:58;24:00;"so he wonders if buff"
24:00;24:02;"is an etymology of brutal and rough"
24:02;24:04;"although clearly there's no rules for"
24:04;24:06;"portmanteaus, so there might"
24:06;24:08;"be some people who might suggest the portmanteau"
24:08;24:10;"of brutal and rough would be brough"
24:10;24:12;"that doesn't roll off the tongue"
24:12;24:14;"broughy line at brunch"
24:14;24:16;"brough brah"
24:16;24:18;"this explanation fits for two obvious reasons"
24:18;24:20;"first of all, all three words are used by one Jake Longstreth"
24:20;24:22;"more than anyone else I've ever heard"
24:22;24:24;"you do say brutal and rough"
24:24;24:26;"and second, buff's definition"
24:26;24:28;"seems to fit between rough"
24:28;24:30;"harsh, crude, unfortunate, marked by lack of"
24:30;24:32;"refinement, and brutal, grossly"
24:32;24:34;"ruthless, or unfeeling, harsh, unpleasant"
24:34;24:36;"the middle of that"
24:36;24:38;"Venn diagram in those definitions is harsh"
24:38;24:40;"you say harsh too right?"
24:40;24:42;"absolutely"
24:42;24:44;"however I think there's more to it than that"
24:44;24:46;"buff in the way that Jake and I"
24:46;24:48;"use it has an element of social critique"
24:48;24:50;"while brutal and rough seem to be"
24:50;24:52;"used more to express general negativity"
24:52;24:54;"I guess I should take a minute to posit what"
24:54;24:56;"exactly I think the definition of buff is"
24:56;24:58;"I'm curious what you guys will think"
24:58;25:00;"when something is buffed, it's harsh"
25:00;25:02;"or un-mellow, in a way that makes"
25:02;25:04;"one resent the reality in which such a thing"
25:04;25:06;"can exist. Buffness"
25:06;25:08;"is the dusty August sun baking an"
25:08;25:10;"8 lane road here in downtown Salt Lake"
25:10;25:12;"City. Oh, tighties from Salt Lake"
25:12;25:14;"shout out Salt Lake"
25:14;25:16;"Buffness is a used car lot where the prices are"
25:16;25:18;"written on with that weird crayon"
25:18;25:20;"and the salesman's neon blue button down that came in a"
25:20;25:22;"wrapper. Buffness is DT's"
25:22;25:24;"golden toilet. Oh, Trump"
25:24;25:26;"yep, that's pretty buff"
25:26;25:28;"It's the white stucco on the strip mall subway wall"
25:28;25:30;"in Lake Chambers. A painting by"
25:30;25:32;"Jake Longstreth. Wow"
25:32;25:34;"this guy's deep. Motley Crue"
25:34;25:36;"and the American use of umlauts in general"
25:36;25:38;"classic rock radio ad breaks"
25:38;25:40;"and the great pacific garbage patch"
25:40;25:42;"buff buff buff. Maybe it's just"
25:42;25:44;"because of"
25:44;25:46;"unbearably white, but it seems like things that are buff"
25:46;25:48;"are hard to look at, or in some other way"
25:48;25:50;"difficult to endure. They're almost too real"
25:50;25:52;"and therefore make us uncomfortable"
25:52;25:54;"Buffness lays bare the unfortunate reality"
25:54;25:56;"of the human race, and as Adam"
25:56;25:58;"and Eve covered their newfound nakedness with"
25:58;26:00;"skins, we recoil from buffness"
26:00;26:02;"and try to shield our eyes from it"
26:02;26:04;"This brings me to my second hypothesis"
26:04;26:06;"for the origin of Jake's buff"
26:06;26:08;"It's the unpleasant, unvarnished nakedness"
26:08;26:10;"of reality"
26:10;26:12;"As I've thought about the word buff over the"
26:12;26:14;"past couple of days, the more it comes to perfectly"
26:14;26:16;"exemplify the unfortunate reality"
26:16;26:18;"of American culture in the early 21st"
26:18;26:20;"century. It's a buff world"
26:20;26:22;"we live in. From corporate food twitter"
26:22;26:24;"accounts to for-profit prisons"
26:24;26:26;"from the beige strip malls of my and your"
26:26;26:28;"and all of our hometowns, to the strip"
26:28;26:30;"mining eating away at the mountains across the"
26:30;26:32;"valley. So thanks for giving us a word"
26:32;26:34;"to use for it. Epilogue"
26:34;26:36;"I'd like to leave you with an observation of a rare"
26:36;26:38;"triple alignment of buffness"
26:38;26:40;"As I'm"
26:40;26:42;"sure you're aware, on February 3rd, 2019"
26:42;26:44;"Adam Levine and his rock and roll band"
26:44;26:46;"Maroon 5 performed a halftime show"
26:46;26:48;"at the big game, the Super Bowl"
26:48;26:50;"At a certain point, the rebellious Levine"
26:50;26:52;"decided to remove his shirt, thus displaying"
26:52;26:54;"his buffness in three ways. Number one,"
26:54;26:56;"he was unclothed, or in the buff"
26:56;26:58;"Two, he is surprisingly muscular"
26:58;27:00;"and could reasonably be described"
27:00;27:02;"as buff. And three,"
27:02;27:04;"the grommeted belt, the"
27:04;27:06;"space-filling sailor tattoos, the"
27:06;27:08;"Mormon haircut, the gold cha--"
27:08;27:10;"Mormon haircut? The gold chains,"
27:10;27:12;"the attempt to be cool and rebellious at the center of the"
27:12;27:14;"ultimate orgy of American capitalism"
27:14;27:16;"It was just so buff. Zab's a great"
27:16;27:18;"writer. Yeah, hell of an email. Very"
27:18;27:20;"poetic. And actually, that's"
27:20;27:22;"some real deep analysis, 'cause"
27:22;27:24;"I would've been content to leave it at just brutal"
27:24;27:26;"and rough portmanteau, but I think"
27:26;27:28;"there's something right, that there is"
27:28;27:30;"when buff comes up-- I like"
27:30;27:32;"what you said, yeah, about the sun glaring off"
27:32;27:34;"the hot asphalt"
27:34;27:36;"It's like exposed, it's um"
27:36;27:38;"Well, and also, you know, whether or not"
27:38;27:40;"this is-- his definition's accurate,"
27:40;27:42;"I do like the distinction he's just drawing"
27:42;27:44;"in general about there's moments in life"
27:44;27:46;"and this might not really have to do with the moment"
27:46;27:48;"itself, but more your frame of mind where"
27:48;27:50;"some of the sh*t comes across your desk"
27:50;27:52;"bad situation, and momentarily"
27:52;27:54;"you say, ""Ugh, brutal"
27:54;27:56;"rough, damn, tough break"
27:56;27:58;"something bad happened. This sucks"
27:58;28:00;"this sucks, I'm gonna have to stay"
28:00;28:02;"at work another couple hours"
28:02;28:04;"you know, damn, I'm sorry to hear that."" Whatever"
28:04;28:06;"you hear about something brutal or rough"
28:06;28:08;"the idea that this other word"
28:08;28:10;"could be used to describe something"
28:10;28:12;"that's more about, not just"
28:12;28:14;"a temporary disappointment"
28:14;28:16;"but almost like a"
28:16;28:18;"tear in the veil of"
28:18;28:20;"civilization that lets you see through to the ultimate"
28:20;28:22;"buffness of reality, that's deeper"
28:22;28:24;"and I almost know what he means by that distinction"
28:24;28:26;"one frame of mind, even if you're"
28:26;28:28;"in a bad mood, you're just like, ""Damn, now I"
28:28;28:30;"gotta deal with that, okay."" And then"
28:30;28:32;"other times you're just like, ""Yep"
28:32;28:34;"that's it, the real world"
28:34;28:36;"the real sh*tty world."" Mask"
28:36;28:38;"off. Yep, mask off."
28:38;28:40;"That's buff."
28:40;28:42;"Buff. And I'll tell you, I like that he pointed"
28:42;28:44;"out the three definitions that apply"
28:44;28:46;"to Adam Levine, because"
28:46;28:48;"there is something more interesting"
28:48;28:50;"about the word buff than brutal or rough, 'cause brutal"
28:50;28:52;"or rough, you could use it in the way that you"
28:52;28:54;"use it Jake, but they're also just"
28:54;28:56;"you might use it, have more fun in the way you"
28:56;28:58;"use it, but you're using it accurately the way everybody"
28:58;29:00;"is familiar with the definition, brutal or rough."
29:00;29:02;"Yeah, yeah. The classic is"
29:02;29:04;"this is a buffy trap sitch."
29:04;29:06;"But buff, buff is funny"
29:06;29:08;"because there is this other definition"
29:08;29:10;"that's ostensibly a good thing"
29:10;29:12;"being in good shape. Oh yeah."
29:12;29:14;"And there is something funny too"
29:14;29:16;"that almost makes you picture like"
29:16;29:18;"like a dude who's too jacked"
29:18;29:20;"where you're kind of like, ""Oh yeah, he's in great"
29:20;29:22;"shape. He's buff."" And then you're like"
29:22;29:24;"looking somewhere, he's like, ""He's"
29:24;29:26;"buff."""
29:26;29:28;"And maybe even traffic, like a good thing"
29:28;29:30;"Yeah, something about the state of being"
29:30;29:32;"that like the supposedly good thing that"
29:32;29:34;"turned terrible. Too much of it."
29:34;29:36;"Yeah, like driving in a car, getting"
29:36;29:38;"places faster, the interstate"
29:38;29:40;"highway system, all good things,"
29:40;29:42;"ostensibly, but then at a certain"
29:42;29:44;"turning point, they become buff."
29:44;29:46;"Baby, I love you"
29:46;29:48;"but that's not"
29:48;29:50;"enough"
29:50;29:52;"Pulling away has been"
29:52;29:54;"unbearably bad"
29:54;29:56;"I ran up the mountain"
29:56;29:58;"out of your sight"
29:58;30:00;"Snow on the"
30:00;30:02;"peak was just"
30:02;30:04;"unbearably wet"
30:14;30:16;"The city was"
30:16;30:18;"freezing, you nearly"
30:18;30:20;"can't float"
30:20;30:22;"The wind at the doorway"
30:22;30:24;"was unbearably cold"
30:24;30:26;"You walked"
30:26;30:28;"to the bedroom"
30:28;30:30;"and sat down to write"
30:30;30:32;"The page of your"
30:32;30:34;"notebook was unbearably"
30:34;30:36;"white"
30:36;30:38;"There's an avalanche"
30:38;30:40;"coming"
30:40;30:42;"Don't"
30:42;30:44;"cover your eyes"
30:44;30:48;"It's what you thought that you"
30:48;30:50;"wanted"
30:50;30:54;"It's still a surprise"
30:54;30:58;"It's hot on"
30:58;31:00;"the body"
31:00;31:04;"It's hot on the mind"
31:04;31:08;"To learn we kept us"
31:08;31:10;"together, darling"
31:10;31:12;"It's what"
31:12;31:14;"kept us alive"
31:14;31:38;"Sooner or later"
31:38;31:40;"the story gets told"
31:40;31:42;"To tell it myself"
31:42;31:44;"would be unbearably bold"
31:44;31:48;"Presented with darkness"
31:48;31:50;"we turn to the light"
31:50;31:52;"Could have been smart"
31:52;31:54;"we're just unbearably bright"
32:06;32:08;"There's an avalanche"
32:08;32:10;"coming"
32:10;32:14;"Don't cover your eyes"
32:14;32:18;"It's what you thought"
32:18;32:20;"that you wanted"
32:20;32:24;"It's still a surprise"
32:24;32:30;"It's hot on the body"
32:30;32:34;"It's hot on the mind"
32:34;32:36;"To learn we kept us together, darling"
32:36;32:38;"It's what kept us alive"
32:38;33:00;"Call it day"
33:00;33:02;"Call it night"
33:02;33:04;"Callous and cold"
33:04;33:06;"and just unbearably wild"
33:06;33:10;"Call it day"
33:10;33:12;"Call it night"
33:12;33:14;"Callous and cold"
33:14;33:16;"and just unbearably wild"

33:26;33:30;"Baby, I love you"
33:30;33:32;"but that's not enough"
33:32;33:34;"I'm kinda wet"
33:34;33:36;"It's been unbearably wild"
33:36;33:40;"I've got a mountain"
33:40;33:42;"out of sight"
33:42;33:44;"It's not me"
33:44;33:46;"It's just unbearably wild"

33:50;33:52;"Time Crisis"
33:52;33:54;"on BEATS 1"
33:54;33:56;"Well, that's a hell of a way to"
33:56;33:58;"dip into the email bag"
33:58;34:00;"Great email from Zeb"
34:00;34:02;"Great email. Beautifully written"
34:02;34:04;"What else we got?"
34:04;34:06;"Okay, we almost need to take a deep breath before this one"
34:06;34:08;"We bookmarked this a while ago because this is just such"
34:08;34:10;"an intense email"
34:10;34:12;"Let's go to the Time Crisis"
34:12;34:14;"mailbag! Just to give you a hint"
34:14;34:16;"at what we're about to get into"
34:16;34:18;"The subject? The ultimate corporate"
34:18;34:20;"food fraud. We're not talking about"
34:20;34:22;"Panda Express here, folks. We're not talking about"
34:22;34:24;"Panda Express because"
34:24;34:26;"nor Domino's"
34:26;34:28;"Panda Express was founded"
34:28;34:30;"by a family of Chinese origin"
34:30;34:32;"If you think that it's a gringo"
34:32;34:34;"Chinese food fake chain"
34:34;34:36;"you got another thing coming"
34:36;34:38;"It's not about Panda Express"
34:38;34:40;"It's time for Corporate Food History"
34:40;34:44;"Let's talk about it"
34:44;34:48;"This email comes from"
34:48;34:50;"Britton Thomas"
34:50;34:52;"My office holds a monthly interdepartmental"
34:52;34:54;"meeting"
34:54;34:58;"Very strong start"
34:58;35:00;"Incredible start"
35:00;35:02;"I also love like"
35:02;35:04;"maybe he says later in the email but also just like"
35:04;35:06;"generic corporate talk"
35:06;35:08;"Do you remember like back in the day"
35:08;35:10;"there was a band from New Jersey"
35:10;35:12;"called Fountains of Wayne? Sure"
35:12;35:14;"I don't think I know the record very well but I just always remember"
35:14;35:16;"that they had an album that the title was"
35:16;35:18;"Welcome Regional Managers"
35:18;35:20;"Wow"
35:20;35:22;"Wait, is that?"
35:22;35:24;"Can you get a number crunch on that?"
35:24;35:26;"That's very post office space"
35:26;35:28;"Pre the American office, post office space"
35:28;35:30;"And actually I think now that the office"
35:30;35:32;"has become just such a part of the fabric"
35:32;35:34;"of like American culture, people just watch the office"
35:34;35:36;"on Netflix nonstop"
35:36;35:38;"Oh that, no it's called Welcome Interstate Managers"
35:38;35:40;"Some of the jokes on the American office"
35:40;35:42;"now it's almost like cheers"
35:42;35:44;"It's just like everybody knows it"
35:44;35:46;"But when you really think about the fact that"
35:46;35:48;"back in the days of the office, the fact that"
35:48;35:50;"one of the running jokes was about"
35:50;35:52;"whether or not Dwight"
35:52;35:54;"was assistant regional manager"
35:54;35:56;"or assistant to the regional manager"
35:56;35:58;"That was like a great, very modern"
35:58;36:00;"Yeah, that's wild"
36:00;36:02;"that that humor has become so"
36:02;36:04;"yeah, like exactly what you said"
36:04;36:06;"just part of mainstream"
36:06;36:08;"American culture at this point"
36:08;36:10;"It's like cheers, that's wild"
36:10;36:12;"Well it's also interesting with those shows"
36:12;36:14;"I think about, again"
36:14;36:16;"this is a Bank Depths, I don't know when this is airing"
36:16;36:18;"but somewhat recently, Rashida"
36:18;36:20;"was talking about this Parks and Rec reunion they did"
36:20;36:22;"and it was like"
36:22;36:24;"the first time they had the whole cast together"
36:24;36:26;"Wow"
36:26;36:28;"I think they're all friendly, so there's like"
36:28;36:30;"group hangs happening, but to like truly have everybody"
36:30;36:32;"Chris Pratt, Rob Lowe, everybody"
36:32;36:34;"together was unusual"
36:34;36:36;"and I remember she was telling me about"
36:36;36:38;"that they were going to do this, and I was like, oh that's cool"
36:38;36:40;"I pictured it was going to be like a panel somewhere"
36:40;36:42;"like in Beverly Hills"
36:42;36:44;"kind of industry event"
36:44;36:46;"and maybe like a Q&A"
36:46;36:48;"and I guess they had it at the Dolby Theatre"
36:48;36:50;"3000 screaming fans"
36:50;36:52;"sold out"
36:52;36:54;"and just like some wild sh*t"
36:54;36:56;"and I probably have talked about this on Time Crisis before"
36:56;36:58;"it's interesting sometimes"
36:58;37:00;"as a musician when you meet actors"
37:00;37:02;"who perform in films and programs"
37:02;37:04;"that tens of millions of people see"
37:04;37:06;"and then they'll like come to a"
37:06;37:08;"modest concert"
37:08;37:10;"and they'll be like, yo that was crazy"
37:10;37:12;"like when you bring somebody on stage"
37:12;37:14;"because they look up, how often are you in front of 3000 people"
37:14;37:16;"you might be known by"
37:16;37:18;"infinitely more people"
37:18;37:20;"but even compared to some random band show"
37:20;37:22;"it's just like, damn"
37:22;37:24;"even to stand in front of a few hundred people"
37:24;37:26;"it's like, whoa, that's intense"
37:26;37:28;"so anyway, they had this Parks and Rec event"
37:28;37:30;"and I'm like, yeah"
37:30;37:32;"I wasn't trying to be on some music sh*t"
37:32;37:34;"like 3000, that's decent"
37:34;37:36;"that's decent for LA"
37:36;37:38;"if you guys keep touring, maybe you can get to the Greek in a couple years"
37:38;37:40;"no, I wasn't like that"
37:40;37:42;"I was like, well yeah, people love that show"
37:42;37:44;"and she was like, but you gotta understand"
37:44;37:46;"the thing is, for all of them"
37:46;37:48;"all those people, like Amy Poehler"
37:48;37:50;"everybody, their memories of making that show"
37:50;37:52;"were like, being this"
37:52;37:54;"like, not particularly"
37:54;37:56;"critically acclaimed show that was"
37:56;37:58;"always about to be cancelled"
37:58;38:00;"so for them to see people years after"
38:00;38:02;"people who feel so"
38:02;38:04;"connected to the show, that's some wild sh*t"
38:04;38:06;"and I think the same thing was true for The Office"
38:06;38:08;"those were like two shows that I think in the streaming era"
38:08;38:10;"became like"
38:10;38:12;"almost like friends level or something"
38:12;38:14;"for some people, and I was just thinking about it"
38:14;38:16;"I was like, you know the first show I ever like, binge watched"
38:16;38:18;"on Netflix? It was when we were recording"
38:18;38:20;"Contra and I was really stressed out"
38:20;38:22;"and I just started coming home and just taking down"
38:22;38:24;"like, 6 episodes of The Office"
38:24;38:26;"so anyway, it is interesting that those shows"
38:26;38:28;"could almost be like, part of"
38:28;38:30;"you know, friends-esque, just like part of"
38:30;38:32;"mainstream culture now"
38:32;38:34;"they're like the Velvet Underground, it's like not everyone saw those shows"
38:34;38:36;"when they first started, but everyone that saw"
38:36;38:38;"those shows, made their own shows"
38:38;38:40;"started a show"

41:12;41:15;"- When I think about the humor of ""The Office,"""
41:15;41:17;"it is interesting because I think sometimes now,"
41:17;41:20;"like I've even seen like the occasional like joke,"
41:20;41:21;"I guess this is what always happens,"
41:21;41:24;"like the occasional like joke on like Instagram"
41:24;41:25;"where somebody refers to like ""Office"""
41:25;41:29;"as being like your average American who loves ""The Office"""
41:29;41:32;"and you know, goes to Home Depot, you know, that type."
41:32;41:33;"And I'm like, but it is funny"
41:33;41:35;"when I think about the early humor of ""The Office,"""
41:35;41:36;"the way I always interpreted it,"
41:36;41:39;"and maybe it got a little more sentimental towards the end,"
41:39;41:41;"and maybe also my frame of reference"
41:41;41:45;"was this is the American version of the British version."
41:45;41:46;"The way I always interpreted that show"
41:46;41:49;"is I was like, this is a show about people living in hell."
41:49;41:52;"Like this is a show about the idiocy"
41:52;41:53;"of a corporate environment"
41:53;41:55;"like being forced to spend time together."
41:55;41:59;"You know, there's even something about like the romantic things"
41:59;42:00;"between Jim and Pam was always like,"
42:00;42:04;"almost like this slight, very small ray of hope"
42:04;42:06;"in an otherwise like buff environment."
42:06;42:07;"I don't know why that came to mind,"
42:07;42:09;"but I was like, that to me was like a classic joke"
42:09;42:10;"from ""The Office."""
42:10;42:13;"It's Kafkaesque to be the assistant regional manager"
42:13;42:14;"versus the assistant, you know,"
42:14;42:17;"it's really like some weird like existential"
42:17;42:20;"like Soviet drama or something."
42:20;42:23;"And it is funny to think that that show"
42:23;42:25;"could be considered like ""Cheers"" now to some people,"
42:25;42:27;"where it's like, and maybe that is what the show became."
42:27;42:29;"I actually, this makes me actually want to go re-watch"
42:29;42:31;"""The Office"" 'cause I think I might be like 10 years now"
42:31;42:33;"since I really went deep on it."
42:33;42:34;"- Yeah, it's not wholesome."
42:34;42:36;"The way those '80s sitcoms were."
42:36;42:37;"- Yeah, maybe it got wholesome."
42:37;42:38;"- It's not affirming."
42:38;42:40;"- Yeah, but I feel like people talk about it as like,"
42:40;42:41;"'cause the point of ""Cheers"" was like,"
42:41;42:42;"hey, life's tough out there,"
42:42;42:44;"but here we can be together."
42:44;42:46;"You know, this is your home away from home."
42:46;42:48;"And these people, they might not be your family,"
42:48;42:51;"but it's the type of family that we find here at ""Cheers."""
42:51;42:54;"And you can read ""The Office"" that way, I guess, if you want,"
42:54;42:56;"but I always thought of it as like people living in hell,"
42:56;42:59;"fighting over whether you're the assistant regional manager"
42:59;43:00;"or the assistant to the regional manager."
43:00;43:03;"- It's more brutal than you even remember it being."
43:03;43:04;"- It is."
43:04;43:06;"- I've been re-watching it the last two weeks."
43:06;43:10;"Something about the hindsight of it, I mean, it's so funny,"
43:10;43:12;"but all of that, it's hell."
43:12;43:14;"- Or like the BJ Novak character being like"
43:14;43:17;"the small-town pretentious [bleep]"
43:17;43:19;"who thinks he's gonna like get out"
43:19;43:20;"and likes to stun on everybody."
43:20;43:22;"And then he gets like humiliated, right, long-term?"
43:22;43:24;"- Yeah, we actually watched that episode last night."
43:24;43:25;"- Oh, really? - Yeah, he gets humiliated,"
43:25;43:29;"and his punishment is that he has to go back and work there."
43:29;43:30;"- Ugh. - That's his punishment."
43:30;43:31;"- A lot of people don't know this,"
43:31;43:33;"but ""The Office"" actually takes place--"
43:33;43:35;"literally takes place in hell."
43:35;43:36;"I'm not being metaphoric."
43:36;43:37;"Not being metaphorical."
43:37;43:39;"""The Office"" takes place in hell."
43:39;43:43;"It's based on a play by Jean-Paul Sartre."
43:43;43:44;"- [laughs] - You know, it's funny."
43:44;43:46;"It's like when you haven't watched something in a long time,"
43:46;43:48;"it's always random jokes that stick in your brain."
43:48;43:52;"I remember there was one of the jokes about the BJ Novak character"
43:52;43:56;"who's like the kind of ambitious, pretentious local Scranton guy"
43:56;43:59;"was maybe when he moves to New York or something,"
43:59;44:01;"he comes back and he keeps talking to somebody"
44:01;44:03;"about, like, New York sushi."
44:03;44:04;"I don't even remember what the joke was,"
44:04;44:06;"but just that he kept talking about New York sushi."
44:06;44:08;"He's like, ""Oh, the sushi here is terrible."
44:08;44:11;"""New York sushi, it's on another level."""
44:11;44:14;"Yeah, it's like they didn't like the characters"
44:14;44:16;"that they were writing and performing,"
44:16;44:17;"which is fine."
44:17;44:19;"I like a more cynical view in things,"
44:19;44:23;"but the '80s sitcoms, it's like they were written so you would have--"
44:23;44:26;"Actually, the irony is that the '80s ones,"
44:26;44:29;"they were designed to develop affection for the characters"
44:29;44:31;"and warmth towards them."
44:31;44:32;"I don't think ""The Office"" was designed that way,"
44:32;44:34;"but it ended up happening anyway."
44:34;44:36;"And maybe that is the most human thing you could present"
44:36;44:39;"is saying life is hell, but you spend enough time"
44:39;44:42;"with even bad, flawed people,"
44:42;44:45;"and you will find a degree of affection for them"
44:45;44:48;"because we are all human beings living in hell together."
44:48;44:50;"That's the type of pessimism so buff"
44:50;44:52;"that it comes back to optimism."
44:52;44:54;"There's another sitcom that I feel is the blueprint"
44:54;44:57;"for that kind of animosity towards its characters."
44:57;44:59;"Oh, you're right, ""Friends."""
44:59;45:03;"Because ""Friends"" is the epitome of the '90s New York,"
45:03;45:05;"just kind of cutting remarks."
45:05;45:08;"But again, at the end of the day, the title reminded us"
45:08;45:12;"that these people, these kind of ironic '90s New Yorkers,"
45:12;45:16;"in spite of their differences and their kind of edgy sense of humor,"
45:16;45:19;"they were in fact friends, and I'm really glad you brought that up."
45:19;45:21;"I'm going back to Japan."

46:03;46:04;"- Oh, for sure."
46:04;46:06;"- There was something about Seinfeld that's like,"
46:06;46:09;"maybe because nobody ever actually had to work"
46:09;46:13;"in just like a kind of like fluorescent lit office."
46:13;46:16;"Jerry's on Easy Street all the time. He's even Steven."

46:17;46:19;"- Kramer doesn't actually have to work in kind of--"
46:19;46:22;"- There's no acknowledgement of like economic realities in Seinfeld."
46:22;46:25;"- Well, except for George had to move back in with his parents at some point."
46:25;46:28;"But even George, he like always was randomly getting good jobs too."
46:28;46:30;"- Like working for the Yankees."
46:30;46:33;"- Yeah, George is like some classic baby boomer, failing upwards."
46:33;46:34;"- Yeah, very '90s."
46:34;46:37;"- 'Cause you know, that's a distinction people always draw now is like--"
46:37;46:38;"- The tight eight."
46:38;46:40;"- When people are hard, George had a tight eight in the '90s."
46:40;46:41;"- I can relate."
46:41;46:45;"- That's a classic point people make when there's boomers"
46:45;46:46;"or being tough on millennials."
46:46;46:48;"And they're like, boomers had all sorts of benefits."
46:48;46:52;"The job market was different. You got paid better, blah, blah."
46:52;46:55;"It's hard to imagine a millennial show where a character like George"
46:55;46:57;"just doesn't make sense in the millennial era."
46:57;46:59;"Like a guy who's always like pulling his hair and,"
46:59;47:01;"""Ah, I gotta work at the Yankees."""
47:01;47:02;"(laughter)"
47:02;47:04;"You know, just like--"
47:04;47:05;"It's just a very different vibe."
47:05;47:06;"- Yeah."
47:06;47:09;"- Anyway, you're listening to TV Talk."
47:09;47:11;"- This episode of The Watch."
47:11;47:15;"- This is an episode of Time Crisis, colon, Watch,"
47:15;47:18;"where we pick, you know, relatively obscure TV shows"
47:18;47:21;"like The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, and we do a deep dive."
47:21;47:24;"And we hope that after you listen to us jawbone about these shows"

47:26;47:28;"And we tell you where to catch them too."
47:28;47:32;"So for instance, The Office is streaming on Netflix."
47:32;47:33;"I believe Friends is too."
47:33;47:36;"Now Seinfeld, however, that one you're going to find on Hulu."
47:36;47:39;"- You could also catch it weeknights at 11 on your local stations,"
47:39;47:41;"local Fox usually."
47:41;47:44;"- And with all these shows, you can also get the DVDs from the library."

50:06;50:08;"- Okay, we've read one half sentence."
50:08;50:10;"(laughing)"
50:10;50:12;"- Of the email from Britain."
50:12;50:14;"- We got eight words into the email."
50:14;50:16;"- I don't even know if we said their name, Britain."
50:16;50:17;"- Yep."
50:17;50:19;"- This is about the ultimate corporate food fraud."
50:19;50:21;"Crisis crew, my office holds a monthly"
50:21;50:24;"inter-departmental meeting and the key selling point"
50:24;50:27;"is a lukewarm batch of mediocre bagels."
50:27;50:28;"- Sold."
50:28;50:30;"- These bagels typically come from a run of the mill outfit"
50:30;50:35;"like Panera, Einstein Bros, or I wonder how you say this,"
50:35;50:38;"Brugers, Broigers, Bruggers?"
50:38;50:39;"I know the place."
50:39;50:40;"- Brugers."
50:40;50:41;"- You think people say Brugers?"
50:41;50:42;"- Probably."
50:42;50:44;"- This month's meeting is taking place tomorrow,"
50:44;50:46;"so I set off on my walk home this evening"
50:46;50:48;"with bagels in the back of my mind."
50:48;50:52;"- That is a very heavy novelistic detail."
50:52;50:55;"- That's like a modern Kafkaesque novel."
50:55;50:56;"- Bagels tomorrow."
50:56;50:58;"Hope they don't get that blueberry cream cheese."
50:58;51:00;"- I was informed by my superior that tomorrow"
51:00;51:03;"would be the monthly inter-departmental meeting."
51:03;51:05;"As I walked back to my flat,"
51:05;51:07;"(laughing)"
51:07;51:10;"I thought about the lukewarm batch of mediocre bagels"
51:10;51:11;"that would be served."
51:11;51:14;"Generally speaking, at the monthly inter-departmental meeting,"
51:14;51:15;"bagels are served."
51:15;51:17;"This could be our big Russian novel,"
51:17;51:20;"and it's called the monthly inter-departmental meeting."
51:20;51:22;"It's like, wait, what's your boy?"
51:22;51:23;"- Um, Nosgard?"
51:23;51:25;"- Yeah, Nosgard."
51:25;51:30;"- 90-page passage on the bagels at the meeting."
51:30;51:32;"- The whole novel's 1,100 pages,"
51:32;51:33;"but the walk home--"
51:33;51:35;"- Is 400."
51:35;51:37;"- The walk home is 400."
51:37;51:39;"Okay, as I do virtually every day,"
51:39;51:41;"I pass my neighborhood Einstein Bros. location,"
51:41;51:44;"but today I pause for a moment to check out the sign."
51:44;51:46;"On the sign are two well-dressed cartoon men"
51:46;51:48;"nestled inside a bagel."
51:48;51:51;"On the left stands a mustachioed man in a bowler hat."
51:51;51:53;"To his right stands a bald man with glasses."
51:53;51:55;"In addition to being inside a bagel,"
51:55;51:57;"each of the men is peeking through a bagel"
51:57;51:58;"as if it were a monocle."
51:58;52:01;"Oh, so this is like one of those, like, you know,"
52:01;52:04;"how many triangles are in the picture type thing?"
52:04;52:05;"- Like an M.C. Escher?"
52:05;52:06;"- Maybe. How many--"
52:06;52:07;"- Or like a magic eye?"
52:07;52:10;"- Or just a logic game. I don't know."
52:10;52:13;"How many bagels are in the Einstein Bros. logo?"
52:13;52:14;"The answer may surprise you."
52:14;52:16;"- Oh, like bagels within bagels within bagels?"
52:16;52:18;"- I thought to myself, ""Wow, what a logo,"""
52:18;52:20;"and I began to wonder, ""Who are these bagel brothers,"
52:20;52:21;"and how did they get started?"""
52:21;52:24;"When I returned home, I immediately began my research."
52:24;52:25;"- Nice."
52:25;52:26;"- Whatever company Britain works for,"
52:26;52:28;"they're lucky to have this person."
52:28;52:29;"- Yep, diligent."
52:29;52:32;"- First stop, the locations page on EinsteinBros.com."
52:32;52:34;"After a quick number crunch,"
52:34;52:36;"thoughts and prayers for Seinfeld."
52:36;52:37;"- He's back. He's back."
52:37;52:39;"- In parentheses. Okay, he's back."
52:39;52:43;"I learned there are 709 total Einstein's locations"
52:43;52:46;"in 42 states plus the District of Columbia,"
52:46;52:49;"including 81 in Texas and a whopping 87 in Florida."
52:49;52:51;"- Strong presence in the Deep South."
52:51;52:52;"- Yeah, that's deep."
52:52;52:55;"Einstein bagels, I'm aware of them."
52:55;52:57;"I see them around L.A. again."
52:57;52:58;"- Never hit it."
52:58;52:59;"- Growing up in Jersey,"
52:59;53:00;"and I imagine the whole tri-state,"
53:00;53:02;"the idea that Sunday morning,"
53:02;53:03;"mom or dad would go out"
53:03;53:08;"and bring back a brown paper bag of bagels from a chain?"
53:08;53:09;"- Hell no."
53:09;53:10;"- That wasn't happening."
53:10;53:12;"For the most part, in the tri-state,"
53:12;53:14;"you get bagels from a local bagel place."
53:14;53:16;"You also get pizza from a local pizza place."
53:16;53:17;"- Big time."
53:17;53:19;"- We did do the occasional Domino's stuff."
53:19;53:20;"I'm not gonna lie, but, you know,"
53:20;53:22;"you order from, like we've talked about on the show,"
53:22;53:23;"you order from Angelo's, Tony's."
53:23;53:24;"- Antonio's."
53:24;53:25;"- That was your answer."
53:25;53:26;"- Pizza Villa."
53:26;53:29;"(laughing)"
53:29;53:30;"- So that is a lot,"
53:30;53:31;"and the idea that it's so,"
53:31;53:34;"there's so many in Texas and Florida, surprising."
53:34;53:37;"This is an impressive total for an upstart company"
53:37;53:38;"founded by two brothers,"
53:38;53:40;"a bald one and one with glasses."
53:40;53:41;"I had to learn how it all began."
53:41;53:43;"I expected to find an Our Story page"
53:43;53:44;"featured prominently on the site,"
53:44;53:47;"hopefully with a few historical photos for good measure."
53:47;53:49;"Unfortunately, that page didn't exist."
53:49;53:52;"Instead, I found a link in the footer titled ""About Us."""
53:52;53:55;"The phrasing for the page seemed impersonal and corporate,"
53:55;53:56;"but I guess that's to be expected"
53:56;53:58;"with what is now a huge nationwide chain."
53:58;54:00;"Recently, we were having a discussion"
54:00;54:01;"about Panda Express,"
54:01;54:04;"and what could sound more like a fake thing"
54:04;54:07;"that, you know, an American corporation would event?"
54:07;54:09;"We want to make a Chinese restaurant"
54:09;54:11;"that we can just, you know, put in malls."
54:11;54:13;"What do we call it? Panda Express."
54:13;54:14;"- Perfect."
54:14;54:15;"- Perfect. Done."
54:15;54:17;"But no, that's actually not the story of Panda Express."
54:17;54:19;"But let's see what's going on with Einstein."
54:19;54:20;"This is what the page said."
54:20;54:22;"""Here at Einstein Brothers Bagels,"
54:22;54:24;"we believe in the bagel."""
54:24;54:25;"- Good."
54:25;54:26;"(laughing)"
54:26;54:28;"- It would be weird if you didn't."
54:28;54:31;"""We believe it has the power to do amazing things,"
54:31;54:32;"giving you a reason to look forward"
54:32;54:34;"to morning office meetings."""
54:34;54:35;"- Bingo."
54:35;54:36;"- Wait, so, what is,"
54:36;54:37;"so there's something funny that, like,"
54:37;54:41;"Einstein Brothers and office meetings are like a thing."
54:41;54:43;"- They're both in those kind of, like, you know,"
54:43;54:45;"homogenized corporate landscapes."
54:45;54:47;"- That's also like some post-modern Soviet novel,"
54:47;54:49;"just like, or like, you picture in, like,"
54:49;54:52;"some dystopia where the state has, like,"
54:52;54:54;"a ministry of, like..."
54:54;54:55;"- Bagels?"
54:55;54:58;"- Or like a ministry of, like, happiness."
54:58;54:59;"- Right."
54:59;55:00;"- And they're like, you know,"
55:00;55:02;"like, we need to increase the happiness in the country."
55:02;55:04;"And they're like, one of our initiatives..."
55:04;55:05;"- Increase the bagel ration."
55:05;55:07;"- Is to increase the bagel ration"
55:07;55:09;"for interdepartmental office meetings."
55:09;55:10;"(laughing)"
55:10;55:12;"And there is something about that."
55:12;55:13;"You know, I, actually, Nick,"
55:13;55:15;"you told me to watch that show, ""Corporate."""
55:15;55:16;"I started watching, it seemed like a good show"
55:16;55:17;"from what I could tell."
55:17;55:18;"I only watched the first episode."
55:18;55:20;"But there was literally in the first episode"
55:20;55:23;"something about going to a meeting expecting a bagel,"
55:23;55:25;"or a pastry or something."
55:25;55:26;"But there was something about..."
55:26;55:27;"- Cake."
55:27;55:29;"- But before the cake part,"
55:29;55:31;"that's why they're so hungry later in the episode,"
55:31;55:34;"is they wanted a muffin or a danish or something at the..."
55:34;55:35;"But it was this thing where, like,"
55:35;55:38;"the executives get to hit the tray first."
55:38;55:40;"But anyway, clearly, I've never worked"
55:40;55:42;"in a very corporate environment,"
55:42;55:44;"or like a corporate office environment, at least."
55:44;55:46;"I have been involved with many corporations."
55:46;55:47;"- Currently."
55:47;55:49;"- But I guess it's almost like school, too."
55:49;55:51;"How, like, at school, it's such a big deal"
55:51;55:53;"if it's somebody's birthday and there's gonna be cupcakes."
55:53;55:56;"- Bagel, I've worked in a lot of corporate places."
55:56;55:58;"Bagel Fridays are huge."
55:58;56:00;"And they're universal. - And is it often Einstein?"
56:00;56:01;"Yeah."
56:01;56:04;"- Yeah, I would say Einstein is pretty common."
56:04;56:07;"- But my thing is that, like, are bagels fun enough?"
56:07;56:08;"- You know, you'll go to a place,"
56:08;56:10;"I guess, that throws out some donuts."
56:10;56:12;"- Yeah, donuts is fun."
56:12;56:13;"That's fun, it's sweet."
56:13;56:16;"- But mostly, you're going to a Bagel Friday,"
56:16;56:19;"couple different kinds of cream cheeses."
56:19;56:20;"- Oh, I guess that's fun if you have donuts."
56:20;56:22;"- I know when, at Adult Swim in Atlanta,"
56:22;56:25;"where you really can't get a lot of bagel options,"
56:25;56:27;"certainly not when I was there."
56:27;56:28;"- It was Einstein?"
56:28;56:30;"- It was Einstein bagels every Friday."
56:30;56:34;"Einstein coffee in the big, you know, square."
56:34;56:36;"- Oh, how's their coffee?"
56:36;56:37;"- Not great."
