00:00;00:02;"Jake, I want you to do the intro today."
00:02;00:07;"Okay, this week on Time Crisis, we talk Whole Foods Amazon."
00:07;00:10;"We talk... what else do we talk?"
00:10;00:14;"We talk Neil Young getting political about Monsanto."
00:14;00:17;"We talk about Eminem."
00:17;00:22;"We do the Top 5 from '78, which is touch and go."
00:22;00:24;"All coming up on this week's..."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Eds from Caden."
00:28;00:30;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:30;00:32;"Spook 1."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"They were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances"
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:15;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:15;01:19;"Time Crisis. Back in the building."
01:19;01:21;"What's up, Jake?"
01:21;01:22;"Hey."
01:22;01:23;"How's it going?"
01:23;01:26;"Good. I feel, uh, harried."
01:26;01:29;"Yeah, me too. Do you think it's just the atmosphere?"
01:29;01:34;"You think it's like the wildfires, smoke, the government?"
01:34;01:36;"What's going on, man?"
01:36;01:38;"Yeah, that's contributing for sure."
01:38;01:43;"But I also just am juggling a lot of things in my personal life."
01:43;01:47;"Yeah? Being married's not all fun and games, huh?"
01:47;01:48;"Two weeks in."
01:48;01:52;"Marriage is work. Let me tell you."
01:52;01:54;"The old adage is true."
01:54;01:57;"I've heard that, marriage is work."
01:57;02:01;"That is the most uninspiring, bummer vibe."
02:01;02:06;"When you're 17 and your uncle's just like, ""Marriage is work."""
02:06;02:10;"Yeah, also because you never know what people actually mean by that."
02:10;02:13;"Because some people are probably trying to tell you"
02:13;02:17;"relationships aren't always easy and you have to, you know,"
02:17;02:21;"it can be exhausting, but the joy of a partnership is"
02:21;02:24;"working hard to make somebody else happy."
02:24;02:26;"I don't know, there's that side of it."
02:26;02:29;"And then there's this other side when people say that s*** that's just like,"
02:29;02:33;"""I'm not allowed to get divorced, and I'm mad."""
02:33;02:36;"Right, yeah, and when you're 17 and you're hearing this from some adult,"
02:36;02:41;"you're just like, ""Ugh, I've never dated anyone."""
02:41;02:42;"Right."
02:42;02:47;"""I'm a virgin."" I don't know what you're talking about right now."
02:47;02:53;"Marriage is-- what are you telling me, don't get married?"
02:53;02:54;"Yeah."
02:54;02:58;"I would expect that more if some weird older family member was just like,"
02:58;03:00;"""Don't get married, here's why."""
03:00;03:02;"I'd be like, ""Alright, at least that's a point of view."""
03:02;03:05;"It's not some vague, mysterious complaint."
03:05;03:07;"Just disgruntlement."
03:07;03:09;"Disgruntlement, is that a word?"
03:09;03:10;"I think so."
03:10;03:12;"Anyway, I'm good. I'm good."
03:12;03:16;"No, I do think there's been something in the air recently."
03:16;03:19;"I mean, that's a weird thing to say when more or less everybody's felt"
03:19;03:23;"kind of harried, depressed, scared for almost two years straight."
03:23;03:26;"But there was something about the last few weeks that specifically felt--"
03:26;03:30;"it's October, it's a spooky month, always."
03:30;03:33;"So there's a weird intersection of things happening."
05:02;05:16;"We thought maybe we would talk a little bit about the Amazon Whole Foods merger."
05:16;05:18;"I can't even remember if we ever talked about that on the show."
05:18;05:21;"We didn't, and then on Twitter someone requested it."
05:21;05:24;"It seemed pretty on-brand for the show."
05:24;05:28;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
05:28;05:31;"Let's talk about it."
05:31;05:36;"It is on-brand. It might almost be one of the situations something's too on-brand."
05:36;05:41;"Yeah, I looked into it. It sounds a lot sexier than it actually is."
05:41;05:44;"It sounds dystopian and messed up."
05:44;05:49;"Whole Foods is going to offer points of purchase discounts to Whole Foods customers."
05:49;05:51;"It's like, ""Cool."""
05:51;05:55;"It's just run-of-the-mill dystopian. It's not extra dystopian."
05:55;05:58;"It's sort of like, ""Oh, this way."""
05:58;06:02;"Amazon now owns all 493 Whole Foods locations."
06:02;06:03;"Is that how many there are?"
06:03;06:04;"It's not that many."
06:04;06:07;"I feel like we're actually sidebar."
06:07;06:15;"I have a good memory of one time Jake and I were on a Christmas vacation together in Hawaii."
06:15;06:18;"We were there with a bunch of friends."
06:18;06:24;"I feel like that was the time we spent a lot of time guessing how many Whole Foods were in various states."
06:24;06:26;"Right, right. Like, ""Okay, Oklahoma. How many Whole Foods?"""
06:26;06:29;"I was like, ""Okay, probably Oklahoma City."""
06:29;06:30;"Just breaking it down."
06:30;06:32;"Maybe Tulsa."
06:32;06:36;"Greater Tulsa, two? Three? I don't even remember anymore."
06:36;06:41;"I just love that we were in this beautiful, tropical beach locale."
06:41;06:45;"Definitely our heads were staring at our phones, just guessing."
06:45;06:50;"How many Whole Foods are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area?"
06:50;06:51;"Four?"
06:51;06:53;"Four. That's what I was going to guess."
06:53;06:55;"Amazon bought all these stores."
06:55;06:57;"I read a few articles today."
06:57;06:59;"There was this recurring theme in the articles."
06:59;07:04;"It was like, ""Amazon now owns these stores, which are going to be great hubs."""
07:04;07:08;"Because they're in affluent urban areas for the most part."
07:08;07:14;"They're going to be great hubs for Amazon to leech onto that and start doing all their delivery through that."
07:14;07:17;"It's basically like infrastructure."
07:17;07:21;"And then it's encouraging people to sign up for Amazon Prime."
07:21;07:23;"It's really banal."
07:23;07:27;"It's just like, ""Oh, yeah, okay. These huge companies merging."
07:27;07:30;"Economies of scale. The whole nine yards."""
07:30;07:32;"It's just sort of like, ""All right."""
07:32;07:35;"Okay. By the way, four Whole Foods in the St. Paul."
07:35;07:37;"Oh, we nailed that."
07:37;07:39;"Yeah, we nailed that Minneapolis region."
07:39;07:48;"I don't want to minimize the fact that it is giant monopolies and companies coming together is weird."
07:48;07:50;"But you're just saying it's like--"
07:50;07:54;"I think the reason maybe this one bugs people out more is because it involves--"
07:54;07:55;"It's so flagship."
07:55;07:57;"It involves food, too."
07:57;07:58;"Right."
07:58;08:04;"So probably for the average Whole Foods liberal, there's a feeling of just like,"
08:04;08:09;"""Wait, a big corporation is going to own my food source?"""
08:09;08:13;"It's like, ""Guess what, buddy? They already did."""
08:13;08:21;"I'm just saying this is going to bug a certain type of person out more than the AOL-Time Warner merger."
08:21;08:24;"It's also classic kind of like Walmart style."
08:24;08:27;"""Well, prices are going to drop for consumers."""
08:27;08:28;"Right."
08:28;08:30;"And I've read some various polls."
08:30;08:32;"I don't know how real they are."
08:32;08:38;"They were just sort of like, ""86% of consumers approve the merger because it's going to drop prices at Whole Foods."""
08:38;08:43;"Then you can open that whole can of worms of like, ""Well, how does this affect the production line?"""
08:43;08:49;"Wasn't Whole Foods already kind of like a sellout a la Ben & Jerry's?"
08:49;08:52;"Like, they're already Whole Foods is like this and that's not organic."
08:52;08:55;"And there's kind of like a growing backlash to Whole Foods."
08:55;08:58;"There was one parallel that I thought was interesting that someone wrote about,"
08:58;09:03;"which was how Amazon is sort of following the footsteps of Sears"
09:03;09:09;"in the sense that Sears was like the big retailer of the early mid-20th century."
09:09;09:12;"And Sears started as a catalog."
09:12;09:17;"It was like a 500-page catalog that would show up at your door and you'd order things from the Sears catalog."
09:17;09:22;"And then as the populations in the city started to expand, they started opening stores."
09:22;09:28;"Like, they opened like 300 stores in the 1920s in different cities in America"
09:28;09:30;"because it was all about proximity. People were there."
09:30;09:36;"So it's like you could order an appliance or some hardware equipment from the Sears catalog"
09:36;09:39;"or you could just go down the street to the Sears."
09:39;09:44;"So in a sense, it was like Amazon started as essentially a catalog."
09:44;09:46;"Like, you'd go online and you'd order stuff."
09:46;09:50;"And now Amazon is sort of getting into the brick and mortar world."
09:50;09:52;"Because of like proximity."
09:52;09:58;"So it's interesting to think that there's an old-school version of mail order to brick and mortar"
09:58;10:02;"because I think in our times, we experienced the opposite."
10:02;10:06;"So we think that modernization is all about the destruction of brick and mortar"
10:06;10:08;"and things moving on to, you know."
10:08;10:11;"Yeah, but it's true. Like, there are situations where you're like,"
10:11;10:17;"""Well, I don't want to wait till tomorrow. Like, I'm driving home. I'm going to make dinner."
10:17;10:21;"Yeah. I need to get this and this and this to make dinner."""
10:21;10:26;"People don't plan that intensely where they're like, ""You can't order everything."""
10:26;10:31;"Yeah, there is still value in like going to a place that's near your home to buy things."
10:31;10:34;"Right. I want to bandage this wound today."
10:34;10:40;"I got to deal with this right now. I need diapers now. I can't wait."
10:40;10:42;"-SignTel can relate. -Totally."
10:42;10:45;"-Do you use that Instacart? -Yeah, I've used it."
10:45;10:49;"You can't squeeze the fruit with it, though. You kind of leave it to the other people."
10:49;10:51;"-I agree. -You know?"
10:51;10:54;"What, Instacart is just they shop for you?"
10:54;10:58;"Yeah, you know what's funny? I used to work for a company in San Francisco called Shop Hoppers,"
10:58;11:01;"which has come up before on the program."
11:01;11:06;"This is when I used to run into Kirk Hammett at the Whole Foods in San Francisco."
11:06;11:13;"He'd be like very nimbly parking his white Escalade between two like concrete pillars."
11:13;11:16;"And it'd be like an eighth of an inch on either side."
11:16;11:20;"I worked for this company, Shop Hoppers, which was a shopping and delivery service."
11:20;11:22;"-Shop Hoppers? -Shop Hoppers."
11:22;11:24;"-Hoppers with a P? -No, Hop."
11:24;11:26;"-Hop. Shop. Hop. -One word?"
11:26;11:31;"-Yep. Shop Hoppers. -Capital H or lowercase h, one word."
11:31;11:34;"Was it a-- Would the people order online or on the phone?"
11:34;11:36;"-This was circa 2005. -Okay."
11:36;11:39;"Phone or email."
11:39;11:43;"They would email my boss, this guy named Chris Ford,"
11:43;11:48;"and it would just be like three avocados, two papayas, one head of kale."
11:48;11:52;"Because the computer programming wasn't advanced enough that it was still just sending an email?"
11:52;12:00;"No, this was a local San Francisco business that operated out of the two locations of Whole Foods in San Francisco."
12:00;12:04;"There was one in Soma, and there was one on California and Franklin."
12:04;12:07;"That's so quaint. So they would just email--"
12:07;12:17;"""Hey, Chris, it's Marv. I've got some company coming over later. I'd like to make some guacamole. Let me get--"""
12:17;12:21;"And then he'd print it out and be like, ""Here, Jake."""
12:21;12:24;"-Literally, it's a printout? -I didn't do a lot of shopping."
12:24;12:27;"I was driving, primarily."
12:27;12:32;"-Oh, what? There was a buddy system? -No, no. He had people shopping."
12:32;12:35;"-Chris had a small office in Franklin. -Why wouldn't--"
12:35;12:38;"-There were shoppers and hoppers? -Yes, exactly."
12:38;12:41;"Why would that not be one person, like Postmates or Uber Eats?"
12:41;12:43;"-Or Instacart. -Or Instacart."
12:43;12:45;"-The shoppers are the hoppers. -Really?"
12:45;12:47;"-I think the shoppers are the hoppers. -I did do some shopping."
12:47;12:49;"I think it should have been that he prints out the email, gives it to Jake,"
12:49;12:55;"Jake jumps in the minivan, rolls to Whole Foods, buys the guacamole ingredients, brings it to the guy's house."
12:55;12:58;"This was before smartphones. I wasn't getting email on my phone."
12:58;13:01;"I would go to Chris's office, I would get the printed out email."
13:01;13:04;"Yes. Then--"
13:04;13:06;"No, see, I wouldn't do that. Here's what happened."
13:06;13:09;"He would give the printed out email to a shopper."
13:09;13:12;"They would shop at the Whole Foods. They'd complete the order."
13:12;13:15;"-How did they get to the Whole Foods? -They were there."
13:15;13:18;"-They were at the Whole Foods. That was their shift. -Just lurking?"
13:18;13:21;"-No, that was their shift. -Wait, did they work at Whole Foods?"
13:21;13:24;"No, they were shop hoppers' employees. Independent contractors."
13:24;13:26;"How did they get the printout?"
13:26;13:30;"Chris had an office at the Franklin Avenue Whole Foods."
13:30;13:34;"-Oh, okay. Sorry, I misunderstood. -With a computer and a printer."
13:34;13:39;"-And Chris would be on the cell phone, stressed out. -You mean Whole Foods gave this dude office space for his weird startup?"
13:39;13:41;"-Yes. -That's pretty cool."
13:41;13:43;"-I'm sure it's gone now. -I have a feeling--"
13:43;13:46;"This was a very local, grandfathered-in situation."
13:46;13:51;"I think he was just hanging out in the sit-down area of the Whole Foods with a laptop."
13:51;13:54;"Probably some of that, too."
13:54;13:59;"-Okay, so-- -So then I pull up at the loading dock of the Franklin Whole Foods."
13:59;14:03;"Or the Soma. Okay, so cell phones were in use, but not smartphones."
14:03;14:06;"-So I'd get a call. -You'd flip that flip phone open."
14:06;14:10;"""Jake, we got three orders for you at the Soma Whole Foods."""
14:10;14:15;"So I'd go down to the Soma Whole Foods, like on 4th and Bryan or whatever it is."
14:15;14:21;"Pull into the loading dock. There'd be grocery orders sitting in a cart."
14:21;14:24;"-Yeah. -Ready to go, with the invoice on it."
14:24;14:28;"-I'd wheel the cart to my minivan. -They'd be sitting there unattended?"
14:28;14:31;"In the walk-in. Yes, unattended."
14:31;14:34;"-Really? The shopper wouldn't-- -No, I mean--"
14:34;14:39;"-That's precious cargo. -But a Whole Foods employee is not going to jack stuff out of the bag."
14:39;14:43;"-They had the name of each person stapled on them or something? -Exactly."
14:43;14:47;"Okay. So this is like a sleeper cell. The shoppers and the hoppers never met."
14:47;14:50;"-No, I knew them. -Okay."
14:50;14:53;"-All right, it's not a sleeper cell. -This is so deep."
14:53;14:59;"Basically, this is proto-Amazon-Whole Foods merger."
14:59;15:02;"-This is so old. Pre-smartphones. -I know."
15:02;15:05;"-It was crazy. -We'd stand in orders. There was this one guy."
15:05;15:10;"He would order yogurt and granola and bananas. Just a tiny order."
15:10;15:14;"He's like, ""I'm at my apartment from 2 to 3 p.m. every Saturday."
15:14;15:18;"Get there between 2 and 3, and there's a $20 tip in it for you."""
15:18;15:21;"-So I would make that happen. -He was getting his week's worth."
15:21;15:24;"I think he was like a lawyer. He would just get up at the crack of dawn,"
15:24;15:29;"eat yogurt and granola, and hit the road, and then just be gone all day."
15:29;15:32;"And so, yeah, that was his breakfast for the whole week."
15:32;15:35;"Sounds like a typical Silicon Valley weirdo."
15:35;15:39;"-It was Zuckerberg. -Maybe it was, man."
15:39;15:42;"-20 bucks for driving two blocks. -Oh, not bad."
