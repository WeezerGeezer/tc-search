00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back again. It's the dog days of summer, and we're here to talk about"
00:08;00:15;"something very special. People often say that three is a mystical number, some"

02:19;02:23;"you getting? Mostly Seinfeld fans or does anybody people still want to bring up"
02:23;02:30;"the the Laugh Factory thing? Or is it we just live in a modern isolated world"
02:30;02:35;"where even a sick all over print Kramer shirt is not eliciting comments from"
02:35;02:38;"strangers? Yeah I think you know I've worn this in the past. I've gotten a"
02:38;02:42;"couple of like nice shirt like standard stock compliments but I mean today I"
02:42;02:46;"went right from the house right here so I mean this would be the first"
02:46;02:50;"compliment of the day on the shirt. Should we make the round? Did your wife or son say"
02:50;02:55;"anything about it? My wife was like she's like oh you're wearing the Kramer shirt"
02:55;03:00;"like that was just a neutral like acknowledgement. And your son said daddy daddy you're"
03:00;03:05;"wearing my favorite shirt again. She's like who's that racist on your shirt?"
03:06;03:12;"No but you know. He apologized son. The day is young. Okay Nick you're wearing some kind of"
03:12;03:18;"weird shirt too. What's this? Dewey Crumpler X Cushion Works. Yes. Some weird"
03:18;03:22;"art thing. Do you know who this is Jake? So Cushion Works is coming he's come up"
03:22;03:28;"on the show a couple times. My friend Jordan Stein, mutual friend, childhood"
03:28;03:35;"friend, runs a gallery a small gallery in San Francisco. Yep. And Dewey Crumpler is"
03:35;03:40;"an artist that was featured in his gallery and he did he's sort of a does a"
03:40;03:45;"lot of weird kind of New Age space stuff. Is there any way Dewey Crumpler is his"
03:45;03:50;"real name? I'm like 50/50 on it. I think it's a hundred percent. His real name? I'm"
03:50;03:55;"certain about it. It's a great name. Those are both real. Dewey I've heard of it. I've"
03:55;03:59;"heard there's Dewey Cox well he's a fictional character. Decimal System. Dewey"
03:59;04:04;"Decimal and Crumpler I do that is a real last name you put them together it does"
04:04;04:08;"sound a little bit like a nom de plume. I don't want to show my ignorance but"
04:08;04:16;"Dewey Decimal? Is this his last name Decimal? No no because there's decimals in the system."
04:16;04:20;"Yeah yeah. No it's just books. No his name is Dewey Decimal and he said let's"
04:20;04:27;"organize these books by alphabetically. I understand. He was the first librarian to"
04:27;04:31;"organize books alphabetically. No yeah what's his name? Let's get a number crunch on that. His"
04:31;04:36;"name is probably John Dewey Augustus Dewey. Not a first name. Sam Dewey. Published by"
04:36;04:41;"Melville Dewey. Melville Dewey. Wow that's a very that sounds like Dewey Crumpler."
04:41;04:45;"It's very academic sounding. But who else do you know whose first name is Dewey? Is that a"
04:45;04:50;"nickname for like? Dewey Cox. Yeah no but yeah a fictional a real person named Dewey."
04:50;04:56;"I had a great uncle named Dewey. Wow. I didn't know him very well but it was a"
04:56;04:59;"nickname I'm pretty sure. Maybe his name was like Donald or something."
04:59;05:05;"Deward. It's a male name of Welsh origin that means beloved. Alright Dewey Crumpler."
05:05;05:11;"So Dewey Crumpler this is a great name. Yeah it's a great name and he's a great artist and it's a"
05:11;05:17;"great gallery. Cushion Works. Cushion Works is a gallery. Everybody's wearing t-shirts today."
05:17;05:23;"And well yeah. I don't think I ever wore this before. I saw it I pulled it out of my closet"
05:23;05:28;"said free your mind on it and my first thought was oh that's some Diplo thing. I've got a lot"
05:28;05:34;"of good things from the Diplo promotional world over the years. I remember once there was some"
05:34;05:38;"sort of like Adidas collab and it came in this like amazing box which included a record player."
05:38;05:45;"It was like a cheap record player built into a cardboard case and then I know at some point I"
05:45;05:51;"had a bottle of Diplo branded tequila that we worked through slowly over a year. Anyway so I"
05:51;05:54;"pulled this out I thought it was a Diplo thing and I looked on the back and I was incorrect."
05:54;06:00;"It's Throwing Fits. It's a pod? It's a pod yeah. It's a fashion pod which I went on a few years"
06:00;06:06;"ago. Great pod primarily about fashion. But so this is some kind of Throwing Fits thing. And"
06:06;06:13;"Jake's shirt is a great lead-in to this episode. It's official Jokerman podcast. I'm also wearing"
06:13;06:17;"a podcast t-shirt. Oh yeah. Official Jokerman podcast merch. It's a great shirt. It has"
06:17;06:24;"starting with self-portrait I guess it lists all of Bob Dylan's 70s albums and has the kind"
06:24;06:30;"of the logo of each album. So it's got like the the Planet Waves handwritten scrawl blood on the"
06:30;06:36;"tracks with the lines the basement tapes that kind of a diagonal writing and then at the bottom it"
06:36;06:42;"says Jokerman in Jokerman font. Shout out to Jokerman pod. Great pod. It is a great pod. I"
06:42;06:47;"got on there twice. I got into it recently and actually listened to your episode with Dave. Oh"
06:47;06:52;"fun. Which I really enjoyed after seeing Bob Dylan at the Pantages. I've been on this big Bob Dylan"
06:52;06:56;"thing and finally started listening to Jokerman because I've been hearing about it and I vaguely"
06:56;07:02;"remember maybe something about them and I finally listened. It's a great pod. Just in time for them"
07:02;07:07;"to move on to Velvet Underground. But the material is still there and the content is still there."
07:07;07:14;"There's two years of Bob Dylan pods. Yep. And also I was on the the Wikipedia page for the"
07:14;07:20;"song Jokerman as I often am. I don't know if I've said this before I saw it and I forgot it but I"
07:20;07:26;"was very proud as you should also be Jake especially you to be you know reading like yeah"
07:26;07:30;"Jokerman you kind of like yeah is there any interesting anecdotes about when it was written"
07:30;07:36;"or analysis on the Wikipedia page and then on the bottom there's a part on Wikipedia where it talks"
07:36;07:41;"about in popular culture and like who's covered it and then somewhere it says the Jokerman font"
07:41;07:45;"is named after the song and I was curious I was like well I think we broke this story so I'm"
07:45;07:50;"curious what the citation is going to be. Right. And I looked and it was Time Crisis."
07:50;07:56;"That rules. Because we interviewed the creator of the Jokerman font we confirmed it. That's"
07:56;08:04;"probably our greatest scoop ever here. That's real original journalism. Yeah. You had a hunch"
08:04;08:09;"you tracked it down you confirmed. I feel like maybe it was your hunch well either way it was"
08:09;08:12;"a team effort. Team effort. And I think about stuff like that because that's exactly the stuff"
08:12;08:17;"that I as a music fan want to know. And I think about at random times we've done interviews it"
08:17;08:20;"doesn't always pan out but you know when you're like talking like Huey Lewis or something be like"
08:20;08:25;"man you ever listen to the dead. You just never know when somebody is going to say something which"
08:25;08:29;"one day somebody is interested in Huey Lewis because this is exactly the type of stuff that we"
08:29;08:35;"wonder off the mic. A hundred percent. Yeah. Even if we didn't do this show it would be the exact"
08:35;08:39;"same. We're the type of people who are sitting around listening to music one day and just"
08:39;08:44;"thinking I wonder what Lou Reed had to say about the Grateful Dead. Luckily there there's quite a"
08:44;08:51;"bit. Ample information. Or just like thinking about like did Jerry ever I don't know you know"
08:51;08:58;"listen to Pink Floyd. Yes. The answer is yes. Or you know. What did Jerry think of Van Halen. Yes."
08:58;09:01;"Those kind of things. Exactly. Worlds that you don't know that you know people that were"
09:01;09:06;"contemporaries of each other but acts that you didn't associate in your like that no one associates"
09:06;09:11;"in their minds. And probably nine times out of 10 the answer is going to be something along lines of"
09:11;09:16;"either not for me or oh yeah that's cool. You know which maybe is not going to be that interesting."
09:16;09:23;"Even if we got like Bob Weir back on the show and said Bob we forgot to ask you last time. What were"
09:23;09:27;"you thinking when you first heard Van Halen. He might just be like I thought it was pretty cool"
09:27;09:32;"pretty far out not exactly my scene but you know good stuff. It might be that but you never know"
09:32;09:36;"if there might be something. Incredible technique. Yeah there might be some really interesting. And"
09:36;09:41;"in some ways sometimes all you want to know is that. And of course people's opinions change. So"
09:41;09:46;"you might find some quote from back in the day of like like I said there's something about Lou Reed"
09:46;09:51;"saying that Frank Zappa was like the biggest loser he'd ever met in his life. And apparently"
09:51;09:57;"like later in life he was like no he's cool great musician. You know people. It'd be great to get a"
09:57;10:05;"quote from Lou Reed like if there is a quote on Metallica circa 1985. Oh yeah. If he was in or not."
10:05;10:13;"Absolute dog s***. Terrible tone terrible distortion tone. I'd hate to be in the same room as these guys."
10:13;10:15;"Indipassantly"
10:15;10:20;"fumbling away I am your source of self-destruction"
10:20;10:26;"Pains that pump with fear sucking dark is clear"
10:26;10:29;"Kneading on your death's construction"
10:30;10:38;"Taste me you will see for it's all you need dedicated to how I'm killing you"
10:38;10:50;"Come crawling faster obey your master"
10:52;10:59;"Your life burns faster obey your master"
10:59;11:09;"I always think about that too back to Bob Dylan because I remember reading an interview with"
11:09;11:13;"somebody probably Cameron Crowe somebody who was like writing for Rolling Stone in the 70s"
11:13;11:20;"and whoever the journalist was talked about profiling Bob in I guess probably you know"
11:20;11:27;"77 76 whatever and they talked about going to visit him at a hotel room and he just gone down"
11:27;11:31;"to the record shop just to like you know see what was up and he had this huge spread of records on"
11:31;11:39;"the bed one of which was the debut album from the Sex Pistols Nevermind the Books and I remember the"
11:39;11:45;"interviewer recounting this later saying I was so nervous and I felt like I had to ask him about his"
11:45;11:50;"his tour and his new album and it always kills me that I didn't specifically say what do you think"
11:50;11:55;"of that one Bob you listen to it yeah now we may never know Bob's a mysterious figure you know if"
11:55;12:00;"he wants to talk about it he will but I don't know if he's ever had any commentary on punk rock"
12:00;12:08;"really never all right Seinfeld start digging has Bob Dylan ever talked about because he famously"
12:08;12:13;"likes to drop these little breadcrumbs that shows that he's he knows what's going on like he had a"
12:13;12:19;"very like a late era song where he talks about Alicia Keys in the lyrics oh wow interesting oh"
12:19;12:24;"yeah I remember that but there's also a video I've seen a few times on Instagram maybe like"
12:24;12:31;"John Wurster will post it every now and then which it's Bob Dylan on the street in like the early"
12:31;12:36;"80s and the kids are talking about the bands they're into uh-huh and he's like you into rat"
12:36;12:40;"his kids no no it's just like random children okay we're just like playing in the neighborhood"
12:40;12:45;"and Bob asked them that or they asked Bob they he asked he says you into rat yeah are you into rat"
12:45;12:53;"oh yeah they're all right try to find that whoa yeah and it's sort of like oh whoa he's like"
12:53;12:59;"following like early mid 80s like heavy metal right I mean and I guess why wouldn't he but"
12:59;13:05;"yeah you'd like to imagine Bob's like in his early 40s you know it's probably a very confusing time"
13:05;13:10;"for him it makes sense him following music in the 80s but at some point I bet he fully tapped out"
13:10;13:18;"although Alicia Keys right so that was like late 90s or early 2000s I mean it's like has Bob heard"
13:18;13:28;"the strokes I want to say yes he's heard of them has Bob heard Vampire um maybe checked out our"
13:28;13:33;"cover of Joker Man I seem to remember we needed his permission once you don't need permission to"
13:33;13:36;"just cover a song in a concert I think it's because we did a version of it on Jimmy Kimmel"
13:37;13:43;"so we needed permission so at some point it went to his manager I read a funny story about Bob"
13:43;13:52;"that he was talking to like Axl Rose or some member of Guns N' Roses because they famously"
13:52;13:58;"covered Knocking on Heaven's Door on Use Your Illusion but before that they would bust it out"
13:58;14:03;"in concert sometimes so if you were ahead you knew that Guns N' Roses liked that Bob Dylan song and"
14:03;14:10;"would cover it sometimes and I guess before they actually laid it to tape Bob had run into them"
14:10;14:18;"somewhere maybe Axl and as Axl recounted it Bob said hey when are you gonna record your cover of"
14:18;14:22;"Knocking on Heaven's Door and apparently said something like oh like you want us to and he said"
14:22;14:29;"I just want the money and they're like uh all right you got it you could totally see him"
14:29;14:34;"kind of like maybe half meaning it but also enjoying like with a young artist or maybe like"
14:34;14:40;"hazing them just like young fellas you get that cover to tape make a little money for your OG"
14:40;14:49;"oh my god should we listen to that to the Guns GNR GNR version yeah sure I haven't heard this GNR"
14:49;14:55;"version in a long time so this is from Use Your Illusion 2"
14:59;15:03;"Bob got the CD listen to the first like 30 seconds just to make sure he's like all right"
15:03;15:04;"watch the money rolling"
15:04;15:10;"well it ended up being a kind of a big single for them I think"
15:10;15:14;"yeah this is like one of their biggest songs in a way"
15:14;15:21;"I like Axl's interpretation of the beginning"
15:21;15:27;"he's just like doubling himself up an octave"
15:27;15:33;"I can't use it anymore"
15:33;15:47;"feels like knocking on heaven's door"
15:47;15:53;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
15:53;15:57;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
16:01;16:05;"the way he says door is insane"
16:05;16:09;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
16:09;16:15;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
16:15;16:23;"oh"
16:23;16:25;"slash taking over"
16:25;16:27;"sick tone"
16:27;16:43;"yes then you wonder like is Bob pretty familiar with Appetite for Destruction"
16:43;16:49;"he's definitely heard like Sweet Child of Mine and Fall into the Jungle just ambiently yeah"
16:49;16:54;"he ever deliberately throw the album on he's like oh yeah that kind of like"
16:54;17:01;"B section of It's So Easy nice"
17:01;17:07;"that cold black cloud is coming down"
17:10;17:14;"feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door"
17:14;17:16;"door"
17:16;17:28;"it's definitely one of the most over the top Axl vocal performances"
17:28;17:36;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
17:36;17:40;"knock knock knocking on heaven's door"
17:40;17:44;"do you think this is like a f*** what it takes all kind of comp together"
17:44;17:48;"yeah I hear his voice coming yeah he's singing all over the place"
17:48;17:50;"all over the place"
17:50;18:04;"I can't tell if this is just hearsay or not but"
18:04;18:10;"on Quora to the question what did Bob Dylan think of Guns N' Roses version of knocking on heaven's door"
18:10;18:14;"someone Doug Goldstein former personal manager at Guns N' Roses"
18:14;18:20;"that's his byline says I used to get a call once a year from Bob Dylan's lady asking me to thank him for"
18:20;18:28;"thank the band for recording Heaven's Door because they would receive massive checks from the sales of our version"
18:28;18:32;"so like the money rolling in and then here's another good one"
18:32;18:35;"hold on I just gotta see what's"
18:35;18:38;"wait he got a call in the middle of the song"
18:38;18:48;"what was that?"
18:48;18:50;"something about a mortician?"
18:50;18:54;"some 90s like comedian vibe talking about libido"
18:54;18:56;"Dennis Leary"
18:56;18:58;"yeah maybe that was Dennis Leary"
18:58;19:02;"so Axl Rose said this about meeting Bob Dylan again I don't"
19:02;19:05;"quote Bob asked me when you were gonna"
19:05;19:11;"this can't be real Bob asked me when you're gonna record Heaven's Door and I said I don't know but we really love the song"
19:11;19:14;"and he said I don't give a f*** I just want the money"
19:14;19:18;"oh it's even crazier than I remembered I don't give a f*** I just want the money"
19:18;19:24;"I mean I bet this version of this song was a bigger hit than any song that Bob Dylan ever released"
19:24;19:26;"yeah just in terms of like pure numbers"
19:26;19:31;"he never had like huge smash hits as far as I know"
19:31;19:35;"my impression of his career was very album oriented"
19:35;19:37;"yeah I mean he's got his"
19:37;19:39;"I mean wouldn't Blown in the Wind be"
19:39;19:41;"well you know Blown in the Wind was like covered many times"
19:41;19:44;"yeah I'm just saying his versions of his songs"
19:44;19:46;"right like even Like a Rolling Stone"
19:46;19:52;"probably more people have heard GnR knocking on Heaven's Door than have heard Blown in the Wind or Like a Rolling Stone"
19:52;19:59;"I do remember reading I think when I was prepping for one of my two Joker metaphors"
19:59;20:02;"I went on and did a Planet Waves episode"
20:02;20:07;"I remember being very surprised to read that Planet Waves was his first number one album"
20:07;20:08;"1974"
20:08;20:12;"it's the first album of his that ever just like started number one"
20:12;20:14;"yeah it might just be like luck of the draw"
20:14;20:19;"because I'm sure it's you know I'm sure his other albums must have been debuting at number two or three"
20:19;20:21;"here we go we got a little information here"
20:21;20:25;"Bob Dylan on the Billboard charts number one knocking on Heaven's Door 1973"
20:25;20:27;"peaked at number 12"
20:27;20:29;"16 weeks on the chart"
20:29;20:33;"number two Lay Lady Lay 1969 number 7"
20:33;20:35;"Like a Rolling Stone 1965 number 2"
20:35;20:37;"okay that's pretty"
20:37;20:40;"I didn't realize that Like a Rolling Stone was actually a huge hit at the time"
20:40;20:41;"I think that was like a big moment"
20:41;20:46;"but also back then I think feel like things would just like fall off the charts so quick"
20:46;20:50;"Gotta Serve Somebody number 24 1979"
20:50;20:51;"that's cool"
20:51;20:52;"where's the JFK ballad?"
20:52;20:57;"Murder Most Foul that was probably number one on the adult contemporary charts"
20:57;20:59;"probably not Billboard maybe streaming"
20:59;21:01;"because it did it do big numbers on streaming?"
21:01;21:02;"no"
21:02;21:03;"oh I thought it was good"
21:03;21:09;"I just think Bob Dylan's audience is so many people probably still buying CDs"
21:09;21:12;"or not using streaming to yeah to take it down but"
21:12;21:18;"Bob Dylan has only number one only one number one song on any Billboard singles chart"
21:18;21:22;"and it's on the rock digital songs sales chart that's a mouthful"
21:22;21:24;"and it's a Murder Most Foul"
21:24;21:26;"that was number one on the rock digital sales chart"
21:26;21:32;"according to Nielsen sold 10,000 downloads between its release and April 2nd"
21:32;21:33;"oh"
21:33;21:34;"respectable"
21:34;21:35;"interesting"
21:35;21:37;"I wonder how Vampire's done on the rock digital sales chart"
21:37;21:39;"go get a number crunch"
21:39;21:42;"what's the best we ever did on the rock digital sales chart"
21:42;21:46;"so that's like older heads buying the song for $1.29"
21:46;21:47;"yep"
21:47;21:49;"I did not buy it I streamed it"
21:49;21:51;"it's the most important chart"
21:51;21:53;"rock digital sales chart"
21:53;21:55;"we're number one at RDS"
21:55;21:57;"what's that what's that stand for"
21:57;22:01;"we just leveled up number one at RDS"
22:01;22:03;"and it's probably a chart that won't exist that much longer"
22:03;22:07;"I'm sad to say because we're clearly in the streaming era"
22:07;22:12;"and eventually all we'll have left is vinyl collectors and streamers"
22:12;22:18;"and the good men and women who've been holding down the RDS chart all these years"
22:18;22:19;"alright"
22:19;22:21;"will just vanish like sand in the wind"
22:21;22:23;"okay Vampire Weekend"
22:23;22:25;"I don't even know how to read this properly"
22:25;22:29;"it looks like you've had six songs that have hit the rock digital song sales chart"
22:29;22:31;"six songs on the RDS"
22:31;22:39;"Holiday, Five Weeks, Diane Young Five Weeks, Horchata, Two, Unbeliever's Harmony, Harm Me All, Giving Up The Gun"
22:39;22:41;"all spent one week"
22:41;22:45;"so Holiday, I wouldn't have guessed Holiday did five weeks on the RDS"
22:45;22:52;"yeah the Harmony Hall was the highest peaking song at number ten"
22:52;22:53;"top ten"
22:54;22:55;"top ten at RDS"
22:55;22:57;"hey it might not be Bob Dylan but we weren't top ten at RDS"
22:57;22:59;"so what did that sell like 800 copies"
22:59;23:02;"they're probably not going to give you the actual stats on the billboard website"
23:02;23:04;"yeah this is very top line"
23:04;23:05;"I think you're probably right"
23:05;23:11;"you probably had to sell like 800 digital songs to make it on"
23:11;23:15;"I mean I get these charts every now and then"
23:15;23:18;"and the digital sales are low but"
23:18;23:20;"I still am always like"
23:20;23:22;"maybe because the numbers are so low"
23:22;23:24;"they're almost more meaningful"
23:24;23:28;"I feel like once in a blue moon I'll get some sales chart that'll be like"
23:28;23:31;"yeah like for instance like Harmony Hall last week"
23:31;23:32;"and just be like"
23:32;23:35;"35 people bought it"
23:35;23:38;"bought the song Harmony Hall last week"
23:38;23:40;"and then you're like really thinking about it"
23:40;23:43;"in a way this might sound like coke but it's true"
23:43;23:46;"in a way if they're just like 100,000 people bought it"
23:46;23:48;"you know you're like the weekend you just be like"
23:48;23:49;"just another day in LA"
23:49;23:51;"but for me I'm like when you're just like"
23:51;23:54;"35 people bought like Harmony Hall"
23:54;23:57;"and these numbers maybe it's even lower than that I don't know"
23:57;23:58;"for digital sales"
23:58;24:02;"because obviously the vast majority of the quote-unquote sales comes from streaming"
24:02;24:05;"and you see these numbers like 35 people bought it"
24:05;24:06;"a song like that digital last week"
24:06;24:08;"three years after the album came out"
24:08;24:10;"I mean I've probably said this before"
24:10;24:12;"even back in the day even before streaming"
24:12;24:14;"when you get these sales charts"
24:14;24:16;"and I always have gotten them sporadically"
24:16;24:20;"which maybe is for the best to not obsess like every single week"
24:20;24:23;"but it's always interesting when you get a sales chart"
24:23;24:25;"and the old ones used to say regionally"
24:25;24:26;"that was sick"
24:26;24:27;"oh that's tight"
24:27;24:30;"because like when we were on XL or something"
24:30;24:32;"you know it'd say it'd be like Modern Vampires"
24:32;24:34;"there's like 2013"
24:34;24:36;"and you know the album just came out"
24:36;24:37;"they're talking about how that album's doing"
24:37;24:38;"then they'll say like"
24:38;24:40;"and by the way here's like the other two"
24:40;24:41;"and then you just get like the first album"
24:41;24:43;"and it would sometimes literally just be like"
24:43;24:45;"did 70 in St. Louis last week"
24:45;24:47;"and then you really you start thinking about it"
24:47;24:49;"don't quote me on these numbers by the way"
24:49;24:50;"but then you really think about it"
24:50;24:53;"because you're like wow five years after this record came out"
24:53;24:57;"like 70 people this week in St. Louis decided to buy it"
24:57;24:58;"it's interesting"
24:58;24:59;"that's a real bump"
24:59;25:01;"I know I'm not quoting you on the numbers"
25:01;25:02;"but I mean"
25:02;25:06;"I'm thinking about you getting these numbers every week"
25:06;25:08;"and Rashida just being like"
25:08;25:10;"hey can you come to bed"
25:10;25:13;"and you're just in your office just pouring over"
25:13;25:14;"I'm just looking at like"
25:14;25:16;"70 in Minnesota"
25:16;25:18;"I gotta enter the data into the Excel spreadsheet"
25:18;25:20;"no I'm just like we're"
25:20;25:22;"I might be reading this incorrectly"
25:22;25:27;"but I think we only did 12 in St. Louis last week on Contra"
25:27;25:30;"we gotta stop buying organic produce"
25:30;25:31;"babe"
25:31;25:33;"it'd be nice if you got a notification on your phone"
25:33;25:36;"every time somebody bought a digital copy"
25:36;25:37;"that'd be chill"
25:37;25:38;"yeah just like a text message"
25:38;25:40;"that would drive somebody insane"
25:40;25:42;"I mean that's why social media drives people insane"
25:42;25:45;"because it is kind of the equivalent of getting a notification"
25:45;25:47;"every time you sell a record"
25:47;25:49;"We took a vow in summertime"
25:49;25:53;"Now we find ourselves in late December"
25:53;25:59;"I believe that New Year's Eve"
25:59;26:03;"would be the perfect time for their great surrender"
26:03;26:05;"But they don't remember"
26:05;26:09;"Anger wants a voice"
26:09;26:11;"Voices won't sing"
26:11;26:13;"Singers harmonize"
26:13;26:16;"Till they can't hear anything"
26:16;26:18;"They thought that I was free"
26:18;26:21;"From all that questioning"
26:21;26:23;"But every time a problem is"
26:23;26:25;"Another one begins"
26:25;26:30;"And the stonewalls are vomiting all their witness"
26:30;26:32;"Anybody with a willing mind"
26:32;26:35;"Can never forgive the sight"
26:35;26:38;"Of wicked snakes inside a place"
26:38;26:40;"You thought was dignified"
26:40;26:42;"I don't wanna live like this"
26:42;26:45;"But I don't wanna die"
26:45;26:49;"Ooh"
26:49;26:54;"Ooh"
26:59;27:02;"I don't wanna live like this"
27:02;27:04;"But I don't wanna die"
27:04;27:07;"It's so funny that the charts include both of these things"
27:07;27:09;"because streaming is so passive"
27:09;27:12;"even if you're like barely doing numbers"
27:12;27:15;"you could easily just get thousands and thousands of streams a week"
27:15;27:17;"They divide it by 1500"
27:17;27:19;"I don't know if people know that"
27:19;27:20;"that's kind of an interesting fact"
27:20;27:23;"The way that they calculate sales now is that"
27:23;27:26;"if somebody buys a record, that's one record"
27:26;27:29;"but you would need 1500 streams of songs"
27:29;27:32;"from the album to count for one sale"
27:32;27:34;"Like how much is an album now?"
27:34;27:35;"How much does it cost?"
27:35;27:37;"Yeah, if you bought the album"
27:37;27:40;"Well if you bought it on iTunes it'd be probably still $9.99"
27:40;27:43;"If you bought the vinyl, that could cost anything"
27:43;27:46;"from $20 to $40 to buy the CD"
27:46;27:47;"I don't know, $12?"
27:47;27:50;"But digital album, $10"
27:50;27:52;"that equals 1500 streams"
27:52;27:55;"Let's say you got people to"
27:55;27:58;"your album produced 15 million streams"
27:58;28:01;"which is like really a lot when you think about it"
28:01;28:02;"Yeah"
28:02;28:03;"That could be, you know"
28:03;28:07;"That could be 50, I don't know"
28:07;28:10;"Let's say your album produced 150 million streams"
28:10;28:11;"Right"
28:11;28:13;"Because that could mean like"
28:13;28:15;"millions of people listened multiple times"
28:15;28:16;"Sure"
28:16;28:19;"What's 150 million divided by 1500?"
28:19;28:21;"I guess we're just cutting off two zeros"
28:21;28:24;"So, 150,000?"
28:24;28:25;"Wait"
28:25;28:28;"150 million divided by 1500 is 100,000"
28:28;28:29;"100,000"
28:29;28:31;"That's just something to think about"
28:31;28:32;"It's pretty wild"
28:32;28:33;"That's an insane metric"
28:33;28:35;"It's saying that you'd have to listen to every song"
28:35;28:38;"on the album 150 times"
28:38;28:40;"That's pretty rare to listen to an album"
28:40;28:42;"all the way through 150 times"
28:42;28:44;"Well, I guess, and that's streams"
28:44;28:45;"Most people are not doing that"
28:45;28:49;"So, it's really more like listening to the album 15 times"
28:49;28:52;"No, because if the song is like, let's say"
28:52;28:54;"Well, I guess it depends how many songs are on the record"
28:54;28:56;"I'm talking about counting for an album"
28:56;28:59;"Right, so you'd have to listen to the album"
28:59;29:01;"Let's say for, just to keep it simple"
29:01;29:03;"People loving this on-air math"
29:03;29:05;"Let's say, to keep it simple"
29:05;29:07;"You made a 15-track album"
29:07;29:10;"Yeah, you'd have to listen to it 100 times"
29:10;29:11;"all the way through"
29:11;29:12;"That's a lot"
29:12;29:14;"Let's say that 1 million people"
29:14;29:18;"listen to a 15-track album 10 times"
29:18;29:20;"I feel good about this math"
29:20;29:22;"You got 1 million red-blooded Americans"
29:22;29:27;"to listen to your 15-track album 10 times each"
29:27;29:30;"Well, that's the equivalent of selling 100,000 records"
29:30;29:31;"which is like really good"
29:31;29:34;"There still is something about it where it's just"
29:34;29:36;"those numbers are just like so gargantuan"
29:36;29:38;"and you wouldn't even be"
29:38;29:40;"you're only a fifth of the way to a gold record"
29:40;29:41;"at that point"
29:41;29:42;"You're only a tenth of the way to platinum"
29:42;29:44;"So, even that, getting a million people"
29:44;29:47;"to listen 10 times to your 15-track record"
29:47;29:49;"If you want to be going platinum in this day and age"
29:49;29:53;"you got to make it a little more like 10 million"
29:53;29:54;"30 million people doing that"
29:54;29:58;"Well, I'm glad Bob could at least, you know"
29:58;30:00;"score some points on the rock digital sales chart"
30:00;30:01;"That's right"
30:01;30:02;"I mean"
30:02;30:04;"And also, he's a career artist, man"
30:04;30:05;"You know?"
30:05;30:08;"Does Bob have a dark side of the moon?"
30:08;30:09;"Of course not"
30:09;30:12;"But you add up his 39 studio albums"
30:12;30:16;"and his many, many live albums"
30:16;30:18;"You also see some stuff like"
30:18;30:20;"Dylan in the Dead"
30:20;30:22;"Not a well-regarded live record"
30:22;30:23;"But Dylan in the Dead"
30:23;30:25;"I believe it's 7 tracks"
30:25;30:27;"Pretty random assortment of songs"
30:27;30:30;"Like that one randomly went platinum in the late 80s"
30:30;30:31;"That's perfect"
30:31;30:32;"And then, you know, you go global"
30:32;30:35;"Yeah, of course, Bob's a gargantuan important artist"
30:35;30:38;"But even for Bob, those GNR checks"
30:38;30:39;"Huge"
30:39;30:40;"Substantial enough"
30:40;30:43;"Yeah, he doesn't have his accountant"
30:43;30:44;"calling Vampire Weekend and saying"
30:44;30:47;"""Thanks for covering Joker Man on Jimmy Kimmel"""
30:47;30:48;"Earlier in the show"
30:48;30:49;"You didn't move the needle"
30:49;30:52;"You'd asked about Bob Dylan's relationship to punk"
30:52;30:53;"This is interesting"
30:53;30:57;"When he was on Letterman for the first time in 1984"
30:57;30:59;"He performed Joker Man"
30:59;31:00;"With the plugs"
31:00;31:01;"Have we talked about this?"
31:01;31:03;"With Charlie Quintana from Social Distortion"
31:03;31:06;"and Tony Marcico from the plugs"
31:06;31:09;"Actually, that version is the theme song of the podcast"
31:09;31:10;"Joker Man"
31:10;31:13;"Yeah, he did kind of like a punk version of it"
31:13;31:16;"Yeah, so maybe he was at least aware of those guys"
31:16;31:18;"But you want to know, like, almost that step beyond"
31:18;31:19;"Where just like"
31:19;31:21;"Did Bob ever spend significant time"
31:21;31:23;"With London Calling by The Clash?"
31:23;31:25;"Yeah, Elvis Costello"
31:25;31:27;"Are you familiar with the Thunders song"
31:27;31:29;"""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory""?"
31:29;31:30;"Oh, Johnny Thunders"
31:30;31:31;"Yeah, sure, sure"
31:31;31:32;"You're right"
31:32;31:34;"So apparently, according to an interview with"
31:34;31:36;"Sid Silvain from New York Dolls"
31:36;31:39;"Bob Dylan told Johnny"
31:39;31:41;"That he wished he'd written that song"
31:41;31:42;"Okay"
31:42;31:44;"Does that do anything for you guys?"
31:44;31:45;"Does a lot"
31:45;31:46;"No, that's significant"
31:46;31:48;"Bob Dylan was aware of the Johnny Thunders song"
31:48;31:50;"""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"""
31:50;31:51;"I believe that"
31:51;31:52;"And he wished he wrote it"
31:52;31:53;"Yeah"
31:53;31:54;"It's kind of third hand the way they've written it"
31:54;31:56;"Yeah, no, it's definitely not confirmed"
31:56;31:57;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
31:57;31:59;"The most interesting part of that to me is that"
31:59;32:01;"Bob's like, ""I never said that sh*t"""
32:01;32:04;"Is that we know how Jake feels about the New York Dolls"
32:04;32:05;"Yeah, Jake, not a fan"
32:05;32:09;"If that's the only song that Dylan wishes he wrote"
32:09;32:11;"In the genre of punk"
32:11;32:12;"I think that's interesting"
32:12;32:14;"That is interesting"
32:14;32:17;"I got a little pushback in my New York Dolls skepticism"
32:18;32:20;"Online or in the room?"
32:20;32:22;"Online"
32:22;32:23;"Which is fine, very mild"
32:23;32:27;"I think one guy was just like, ""Get your act together, dude"""
32:27;32:29;"Jake's more of a Goo Goo Dolls guy"
32:29;32:31;"You're right"
32:31;32:33;"Well, no, it was in the context of the Rock Hall"
32:33;32:35;"Right, right"
32:35;32:36;"What did you say?"
32:36;32:37;"They don't deserve to be in the hall?"
32:37;32:38;"I mean, we were going through it"
32:38;32:41;"Like, I was on this kick of like, ""Everyone should get in"""
32:41;32:42;"Yeah, yeah"
32:42;32:43;"You know"
32:43;32:45;"But then we got to New York Dolls and I was like"
32:45;32:47;"Okay, they're one of those bands that like"
32:47;32:49;"You see their name checked a lot"
32:49;32:51;"But I was sort of like, ""What is..."
32:51;32:54;"Do they have the catalog? What is the catalog?"""
32:54;32:56;"Coming from a place of ignorance a little bit here"
32:56;32:58;"I haven't done my due diligence"
32:58;33:00;"I know they're a famous band"
33:00;33:03;"I know they're a band that has an important"
33:03;33:06;"Historic role in punk, pre-punk, proto-punk"
33:06;33:08;"Pre-punk"
33:08;33:12;"But, you know"
33:12;33:14;"I think we threw on the top New York Dolls"
33:14;33:15;"Yeah, you weren't feeling it"
33:15;33:16;"Somebody clapped back"
33:16;33:18;"You got clapped back on Twitter?"
33:18;33:19;"Somebody DM'd you?"
33:19;33:20;"Something"
33:20;33:21;"You don't f*** with the Dolls?"
33:21;33:22;"Gugu?"
33:22;33:23;"Burn in hell"
33:23;33:28;"So as people can tell, this is going to be a Bob Dylan episode"
33:28;33:30;"But, you know, hopefully we'll talk about some other stuff"
33:30;33:32;"But we're going to be getting into his greatest hits volume 3"
33:32;33:34;"Which is the perfect place to start"
33:34;33:35;"Yep"
33:35;33:36;"With Bob Dylan"
33:36;33:37;"But I wanted to say one other thing"
33:37;33:40;"Just thinking about Bob and his awareness of what's going on"
33:40;33:42;"Clearly he's like fairly aware"
33:42;33:45;"I just remembered this interview that was posted on his website"
33:45;33:48;"But it was with a journalist called Bill Flanagan"
33:48;33:51;"This was around the time when he was putting out his covers records"
33:51;33:53;"Whenever that was, 5, 6 years ago"
33:53;33:54;"And this guy"
33:54;33:55;"Triplicate?"
33:55;33:57;"Yeah, this is the triplicate era interview"
33:57;33:59;"So clearly Bob okayed the interview"
33:59;34:01;"And he just felt like, let's cut out the middleman"
34:01;34:04;"I'll host the interview myself on my website"
34:04;34:06;"Talk with a trusted journalist"
34:06;34:07;"That's that"
34:07;34:09;"So at one point this guy's asking him about something"
34:09;34:11;"That was called the New Basement Tapes"
34:11;34:13;"The New Basement Tapes I guess was"
34:13;34:15;"A group of musicians"
34:15;34:17;"Put together by T-Bone Burnett"
34:17;34:21;"Who finished songs based on old lyrics of Bob's"
34:21;34:23;"Does this sound like kind of a fun idea?"
34:23;34:25;"What would these songs sound like"
34:25;34:27;"If they'd actually ever been set to music or whatever?"
34:27;34:28;"So this guy asks him about it"
34:28;34:30;"And he says you know, so for the New Basement Tapes"
34:30;34:32;"T-Bone put together a group"
34:32;34:36;"With Elvis Costello, Rihanna Giddens, Jim James, Marcus Mumford"
34:36;34:38;"And Taylor Goldsmith"
34:38;34:40;"To finish songs based on old lyrics of yours"
34:40;34:42;"Did you hear any of those songs?"
34:42;34:44;"And say I don't remember writing that"
34:44;34:45;"And then Bob Dylan just goes"
34:45;34:47;"Did you say Taylor Swift?"
34:47;34:49;"And the guy goes"
34:49;34:51;"Taylor Goldsmith"
34:51;34:53;"And he goes yeah, okay"
34:53;34:55;"No I don't remember writing any of those songs"
34:55;34:57;"Anyway, but"
34:57;34:59;"That was like this interesting moment"
34:59;35:01;"And again, I'm sure Bob must have"
35:01;35:03;"Because it was hosted on his website"
35:03;35:06;"He clearly would have had some degree of control"
35:06;35:08;"And you can picture like an older guy like Bob"
35:08;35:10;"Also just famously savvy"
35:10;35:12;"Playful"
35:12;35:14;"I mean he's the Joker man"
35:14;35:16;"So if he wanted to, you can picture like"
35:16;35:18;"Another older musician who would have this moment"
35:18;35:20;"In an interview where somebody says Taylor Goldsmith"
35:20;35:22;"And they seem to perk up and go Taylor Swift?"
35:22;35:24;"And the guy goes no"
35:24;35:26;"You can see somebody saying like"
35:26;35:28;"Can you cut that part out where I asked about Taylor Swift?"
35:28;35:30;"At the very least just because he was wrong"
35:30;35:32;"You know you can see somebody like just cut that part out"
35:32;35:35;"Where I said, yeah I don't know what people are going to think of that"
35:35;35:37;"But he left it in"
35:37;35:39;"For people to know that he knows"
35:39;35:41;"I also just can't help thinking"
35:41;35:43;"Because of the G&R story"
35:43;35:45;"And I don't think any of this takes away from Bob's artistry"
35:45;35:47;"As one of the greatest songwriters of all time"
35:47;35:49;"But just think about him saying to Axl"
35:49;35:51;"I don't give a f*** I just want the money"
35:51;35:53;"Like maybe he does have this cold blooded business man side"
35:53;35:55;"Or maybe it's a mode he has to"
35:55;35:57;"Go into sometimes just to like"
35:57;35:59;"Not always be in the sensitive crazy artist"
35:59;36:01;"Phase"
36:01;36:03;"But there's also some part of me at first when I read that"
36:03;36:05;"I thought oh maybe he's like a Taylor Swift fan"
36:05;36:07;"Whereas now I kind of think more like"
36:07;36:09;"Bob read Billboard one day and was like"
36:09;36:11;"Taylor Swift tour grossed how much?"
36:11;36:13;"Wow"
36:13;36:15;"I gotta get out there more"
36:15;36:17;"What? How much is she worth?"
36:17;36:20;"And then like I can totally picture that being the last thing on his mind"
36:20;36:22;"And then he's doing this interview and the guy's like"
36:22;36:24;"So all these people covered your songs"
36:24;36:26;"And immediately he's thinking like"
36:26;36:28;"Alright that would be a nice little royalty I guess"
36:28;36:30;"And he's like listening to the list and he's like"
36:30;36:32;"Jim James and he's like"
36:32;36:34;"How much is that? Rihanna and Giddens"
36:34;36:36;"And he's like I don't know a couple thousand bucks"
36:36;36:38;"And he's like Taylor Swift and he's like what?"
36:38;36:40;"It's like"
36:40;36:42;"Did you say Taylor Swift?"
36:42;36:44;"And he's just like thinking like"
36:44;36:46;"He's gonna build a new pool"
36:46;36:48;"Or something and the guy's like Taylor Goldsmith"
36:48;36:50;"And he's just kinda like"
36:50;36:52;"Who's that?"
36:52;36:54;"And you can just like see his thought bubble"
36:54;36:56;"Like the new pool just vanishes"
36:56;36:58;"Who's Taylor Goldsmith?"
36:58;37:00;"Oh from Dawes okay yeah"
37:00;37:02;"Taylor Goldsmith from Dawes"
37:02;37:04;"To a new toaster"
37:04;37:08;"And I mean"
37:08;37:10;"I don't think that in any way contradicts"
37:10;37:12;"Bob's image like"
37:12;37:14;"Sometimes he's like you know channeling"
37:14;37:16;"The muse"
37:16;37:18;"And sometimes he's just a guy with like a massive"
37:18;37:20;"Catalog and a whole bunch"
37:20;37:22;"Of kids"
37:22;37:24;"A sprawling property to maintain in Malibu"
37:24;37:26;"A sprawling property in Tony Malibu"
37:26;37:28;"Got a lot of grandkids"
37:28;37:30;"Grandpa your pool sucks"
37:30;37:32;"Taylor Swift"
37:32;37:34;"It's not salt water it's not heated"
37:34;37:36;"He's just got like a kidney shaped"
37:36;37:38;"Pool from you know 1973"
37:38;37:40;"Oh hell yeah"
37:40;37:42;"But that's why he's also the coolest is that he just like left it in"
37:42;37:44;"He could have cut it out"
37:44;37:46;"He probably appreciated the humor of that moment"
37:46;37:48;"The same way that we do"
37:48;37:50;"Maybe he heard Taylor Goldsmith perfectly clear"
37:50;37:52;"And he just thought it would be a funny joke"
37:52;37:54;"Taylor Swift?"
37:54;37:56;"I mean that does seem like Bob Dylan type humor actually"
37:56;37:58;"You know the guy's like and Taylor Goldsmith"
37:58;38:00;"And Bob Dylan's like Taylor Swift"
38:00;38:02;"He goes no and you go oh alright"
38:02;38:04;"So did he hear those recordings or no?"
38:04;38:06;"Okay so"
38:06;38:08;"Actually Bob"
38:08;38:10;"Specifically gave these additional"
38:10;38:12;"Lyrics to T-Bone"
38:12;38:14;"And tasked him with making this"
38:14;38:16;"So it's okay so it's not that"
38:16;38:18;"Passive he knew so you imagine at some point"
38:18;38:20;"T-Bone probably said"
38:20;38:22;"Oh cool I'll get a bunch of young musicians"
38:22;38:24;"He must have at some point just emailed"
38:24;38:26;"Bob or gave him a call and said like"
38:26;38:28;"Hey Lance I got a bunch of people"
38:28;38:30;"Taylor Goldsmith"
38:30;38:32;"Alright so yes Bob's playing games man"
38:32;38:34;"He knew"
38:34;38:36;"Taylor Swift wasn't on that"
38:36;38:38;"Did a number crunch on Bob Dylan, Taylor Swift"
38:38;38:40;"And there was a song from Taylor's 2020 album"
38:40;38:42;"Folklore"
38:42;38:44;"That used Bob Dylan as a reference"
38:44;38:46;"It's not a cover but"
38:46;38:48;"Taylor was definitely"
38:48;38:50;"Taylor and Aaron"
38:50;38:52;"Dessner"
38:52;38:54;"Definitely used Bob as an inspiration"
38:54;38:56;"For her song Betty"
38:56;38:58;"So you know Bob"
38:58;39:00;"Wouldn't see anything off it"
39:00;39:02;"Like they did interviews and they said this is kind of like"
39:02;39:04;"A Bob Dylan homage"
39:04;39:06;"Do you want to listen to it?"
39:06;39:08;"Also I can see Bob Dylan being like"
39:08;39:10;"So what does that get me?"
39:10;39:12;"Bob gets nothing off it"
39:12;39:14;"Interpolate one of my songs"
39:14;39:16;"Use a riff"
39:16;39:18;"Taylor goes up to him at the Grammys"
39:18;39:20;"When you're just like hey Bob"
39:20;39:22;"She's like super gracious and nice"
39:22;39:24;"I know who you are"
39:24;39:26;"Oh wow that's amazing"
39:26;39:28;"I just wanted to say you're a huge inspiration"
39:28;39:30;"And actually on my Grammy award winning album"
39:30;39:32;"Folklore there's this song Betty"
39:32;39:34;"That's kind of our homage"
39:34;39:36;"And he's just like what percentage"
39:36;39:38;"Did I get? She's like oh no no"
39:38;39:40;"It's not a cover"
39:40;39:42;"It was just like we were inspired by you"
39:42;39:44;"I don't give a f***"
39:44;39:46;"He said hey you know the song"
39:46;39:48;"Knocking on Heaven's Door?"
39:48;39:50;"She's like yeah"
39:50;39:52;"I knew they weren't"
39:52;39:54;"How would you cover that?"
39:54;39:56;"I got a bunch of good ones"
39:56;39:58;"Those G&R checks"
39:58;40:00;"Are drying up"
40:00;40:02;"Come on Taylor"
40:02;40:04;"Aaron Destner explained Taylor wanted"
40:04;40:06;"To have an early Bob Dylan"
40:06;40:08;"Sort of a freewheeling Bob Dylan feel"
40:08;40:10;"We pushed it a little bit more towards"
40:10;40:12;"John Wesley Harding"
40:12;40:14;"Since it has some drums"
40:14;40:16;"Etc"
40:16;40:18;"When I heard the name Betty"
40:18;40:20;"I thought of the Bob song Joey"
40:20;40:22;"From Desire"
40:22;40:24;"Which I've learned listening to Joker Man"
40:24;40:26;"Is like a lot of fans hate the song"
40:26;40:28;"Joey I love that song"
40:28;40:40;"Well yeah obviously the harmonic already"
40:40;40:42;"Gives it a bit of a Bob thing"
40:42;40:44;"Bob's called his lawyer in"
40:44;40:46;"They're just sitting there listening to this song"
40:46;40:48;"Just me"
40:48;40:52;"Do you work with us?"
40:52;40:54;"Is there a grounds for a lawsuit?"
40:54;40:58;"We had Bob play Harmonica"
40:58;41:00;"For 5 million dollars"
41:00;41:06;"This just sounds like a Taylor Swift song to me"
41:14;41:16;"Where's the John Wesley Harding drums?"
41:16;41:18;"It's fun"
41:18;41:22;"It's possible that she"
41:22;41:24;"Maybe she never had Harmonica"
41:24;41:26;"In the song before"
41:26;41:40;"Drums about to drop"
41:40;41:42;"*Drums*"
41:42;41:46;"I'm skipping ahead"
41:46;41:48;"I'm waiting for the drums"
41:48;41:50;"Is it just the acoustic that's giving that"
41:50;41:52;"Percussive sound"
41:52;41:54;"Maybe they took them out"
41:54;42:00;"Can you hear 2 acoustics?"
42:00;42:02;"Our drums are very low in pitch"
42:02;42:04;"*Drums*"
42:04;42:16;"Born in Red Hill Brooklyn"
42:16;42:18;"In the year of a who knows when"
42:18;42:20;"Actually remember"
42:20;42:22;"We listened to a song from"
42:22;42:24;"This album or one of the other ones"
42:24;42:26;"That was about the woman"
42:26;42:28;"Who'd owned her"
42:28;42:30;"Mansion in"
42:30;42:32;"Fort Rhode Island"
42:32;42:34;"That's more of a Bob Dylan thing"
42:34;42:36;"To write a historical song"
42:36;42:40;"I get the freewheeling Bob"
42:40;42:42;"It's just interesting that he's this quote"
42:42;42:44;"Maybe we missed it but this quote is so specific"
42:44;42:46;"He was like ""Yeah, Taylor wanted to do a freewheeling Bob thing"""
42:46;42:48;"And I said ""Let's get a little later in the 60s"""
42:48;42:50;"To kind of like a John Wesley Harding thing"
42:50;42:54;"I feel like the drums on John Wesley Harding are real loud"
42:54;42:56;"And like present"
42:56;42:58;"And really like"
42:58;43:00;"It's all acoustic but with this"
43:00;43:02;"Very tight, forceful"
43:02;43:04;"Great drum sound"
43:04;43:06;"Kenny Butchry maybe"
43:06;43:08;"Playing drums"
43:08;43:10;"Maybe they had the drums and then they heard it"
43:10;43:12;"And they were like ""This is too Dylan"""
43:12;43:14;"""He could get litigious over it, let's dial back the influence"""
43:14;43:16;"Yeah maybe let's dial it back"
43:16;43:18;"Now I'm also just picturing her being like"
43:18;43:20;"""Yeah, this is kind of like a folky song"""
43:20;43:22;"""Thought maybe throw in some harmonica"""
43:22;43:24;"""Do kind of like an early Bob type thing"""
43:24;43:26;"And he's just like ""That's played out"""
43:26;43:28;"""Wanna do kind of like a Joker man thing?"""
43:28;43:30;"""Kind of like an 80s reggae version?"""
43:30;43:32;"He's like ""Alright"""
43:32;43:34;"""Alright I'll try it"""
43:34;43:36;"Just throws out some really deep Bob reference"
43:36;43:40;"Okay well speaking of deep Bob"
43:40;43:42;"Let's see where this takes us man"
43:42;43:44;"Yeah let's crack this"
43:44;43:46;"Greatest Hits Volume 3"
43:46;43:48;"So I think, I imagine that the average TC fan"
43:48;43:50;"Is totally aware of Bob Dylan"
43:50;43:54;"We don't need to do some top 5 Bob"
43:54;43:56;"No"
43:56;43:58;"Homework"
43:58;44:00;"Cause everybody knows Bob Dylan"
44:00;44:02;"Being in this current, listening to a lot of Bob"
44:02;44:04;"And listening to Joker man and stuff"
44:04;44:06;"I've been talking about Bob a lot"
44:06;44:08;"And at some point Rashida claimed"
44:08;44:10;"That she's like ""I don't really"""
44:10;44:12;"""I never got deep on Dylan"""
44:12;44:14;"""I really don't know"""
44:14;44:16;"But then we talked about it and I was like"
44:16;44:18;"And I think this is probably true for a lot of people"
44:18;44:20;"It might not be true for a Leonard Cohen"
44:20;44:22;"Or she was like ""Well of course, I know Blown in the Wind"""
44:22;44:24;"And I think that, honestly I think that might be it"
44:24;44:26;"Then we talked about it and I was like ""You know Hurricane?"""
44:26;44:28;"She was like ""Oh yeah"" I was like ""You know Knockin' on Heaven's Door?"""
44:28;44:30;"She was like ""Yeah yeah yeah"""
44:30;44:32;"And next thing you know it's like everybody knows at least 10 Bob songs"
44:32;44:34;"And that's before you even get into the weird stuff"
44:34;44:36;"Which of course there's quite a bit of"
44:36;44:38;"Over the course of 39 studio albums"
44:38;44:40;"And I guess what I've been interested in Dylan lately"
44:40;44:42;"And of course I've always"
44:42;44:44;"Or at least for the last few years"
44:44;44:46;"Had a deep love of his song Joker Man"
44:46;44:48;"Which is from the 80's"
44:48;44:50;"80's Dylan, you're well out of what"
44:50;44:52;"Many people consider the classic period"
44:52;44:54;"You know obviously the 60's are huge"
44:54;44:56;"Pretty unprecedented run"
44:56;44:58;"And then in the 70's"
44:58;45:00;"By some people's metrics"
45:00;45:02;"A little bit up and down"
45:02;45:04;"But still producing multiple classic, classic albums"
45:04;45:06;"So by the time you get to like the 80's"
45:06;45:08;"He was maybe not"
45:08;45:10;"Super culturally relevant"
45:10;45:12;"Of course he's Bob Dylan"
45:12;45:14;"So I'm sure there was somebody buying a copy of"
45:14;45:16;"The Freewheel and Bob Dylan or Desire every day"
45:16;45:18;"But I think he was"
45:18;45:20;"Bob Dylan"
45:20;45:22;"But you know when you actually picture him in the early 80's"
45:22;45:24;"When you really picture punk and new wave"
45:24;45:26;"And hip hop happening"
45:26;45:28;"Of course people respected him"
45:28;45:30;"But he was you know, he was a man in his"
45:30;45:32;"Early 40's"
45:32;45:34;"An icon of the 60's"
45:34;45:36;"In you know a time when the"
45:36;45:38;"Popular music really was not"
45:38;45:40;"Sounding like 60's music in terms of the"
45:40;45:42;"Production when you know"
45:42;45:44;"We've talked many times on this show about"
45:44;45:46;"The 80's kicking off with"
45:46;45:48;"John Lennon's murder"
45:48;45:50;"And the election of Reagan"
45:50;45:52;"So many reasons why"
45:52;45:54;"A 60's icon in their 40's"
45:54;45:56;"Might feel like a little bit at loose ends"
45:56;45:58;"Yeah I think a lot of"
45:58;46:00;"The stars from the 60's were"
46:00;46:02;"In a similar place to Dylan"
46:02;46:04;"A little bit just like fish out of water"
46:04;46:06;"Think about Neil Young's early 80's work"
46:06;46:08;"Oh that's when he got really weird"
46:08;46:10;"A guy from the 60's and 70's"
46:10;46:12;"Entering into the 80's"
46:12;46:14;"With the new production"
46:14;46:16;"Sounds of the era"
46:16;46:18;"And just making records in that context"
46:18;46:20;"It's all, I love that"
46:20;46:22;"Tension. And I was thinking about this too"
46:22;46:24;"And I'm sure you've put thought into this too Jake"
46:24;46:26;"But like how shockingly little"
46:26;46:28;"Music there is that still"
46:28;46:30;"Sounds like the 60's or 70's"
46:30;46:32;"I mean and of course you could, that's also the rise"
46:32;46:34;"Of some weird DIY cassette"
46:34;46:36;"Indie stuff, so you can find stuff that's like"
46:36;46:38;"Vibey with tape hiss"
46:38;46:40;"But when you listen to the music"
46:40;46:42;"You could totally understand if many"
46:42;46:44;"Of the older musicians"
46:44;46:46;"Decided to try to keep up with the new sounds"
46:46;46:48;"80's drum sounds"
46:48;46:50;"You know, new digital recording"
46:50;46:52;"But you would think maybe there'd be some percentage of people"
46:52;46:54;"Who'd be like, oh man I'm sticking with"
46:54;46:56;"My old board and tape machine, still works"
46:56;46:58;"And we know this equipment exists"
46:58;47:00;"Because there's people spending millions"
47:00;47:02;"Of dollars on it now"
47:02;47:04;"You know you always hear this where people are like"
47:04;47:06;"Oh yeah and then this rich dude bought the"
47:06;47:08;"Board that was at"
47:08;47:10;"Abbey Road that they recorded"
47:10;47:12;"Dark Side of the Moon on, oh man he paid"
47:12;47:14;"3 million dollars for it"
47:14;47:16;"You know there's even famous"
47:16;47:18;"Boards where people"
47:18;47:20;"Will buy like a single channel"
47:20;47:22;"Because then you can like pop out the channels"
47:22;47:24;"And you don't necessarily need the whole board"
47:24;47:26;"In the modern world"
47:26;47:28;"And you know, they'll pay top dollar"
47:28;47:30;"Especially if the provenance is interesting"
47:30;47:32;"And then old tape machines"
47:32;47:34;"Sometimes getting tape can be an issue"
47:34;47:36;"But you know people covered this stuff"
47:36;47:38;"So it's not like it was all destroyed"
47:38;47:40;"It does feel like in the 80s"
47:40;47:42;"It was all put in a closet"
47:42;47:44;"And I wonder if, even if you're Bob Dylan"
47:44;47:46;"Or something, or Neil Young"
47:46;47:48;"And this was maybe not their artistic"
47:48;47:50;"Intention, but you could think"
47:50;47:52;"Maybe one of these 60s guys would be like"
47:52;47:54;"Let's just like keep using the old tape machine"
47:54;47:56;"It's got a certain, it's kind of my sound"
47:56;47:58;"I want to stick with it, and yet literally"
47:58;48:00;"Nobody did, so then you start to imagine"
48:00;48:02;"That either they built a new home studio"
48:02;48:04;"And it was like top of the line gear"
48:04;48:06;"Or they rolled into all the normal"
48:06;48:08;"Studios in the big cities that they would go to"
48:08;48:10;"And just, things had moved on"
48:10;48:12;"And they'd listen back"
48:12;48:14;"And they'd just be like, close enough"
48:14;48:16;"That paints a portrait of these artists being very passive"
48:16;48:18;"Which they clearly weren't"
48:18;48:20;"So it's like, it is fascinating"
48:20;48:22;"That the picture, these guys"
48:22;48:24;"Recording in like 1982 and like hearing"
48:24;48:26;"That like drum tone with all the reverb"
48:26;48:28;"On it and being like, does that sound good to you guys?"
48:28;48:30;"And the engineer being like, yep"
48:30;48:32;"Sounds good, and I guess maybe"
48:32;48:34;"If also, if we're talking about these major icons"
48:34;48:36;"They were still interested in maybe like"
48:36;48:38;"Trying to have hits"
48:38;48:40;"And like, not wanting to admit that like"
48:40;48:42;"Maybe their biggest days were behind them"
48:42;48:44;"Which is human nature"
48:44;48:46;"And they were just like, yeah, let's keep up with the times"
48:46;48:48;"Like I was a big deal in 1970"
48:48;48:50;"Why can't I be a big deal in 1982?"
48:50;48:52;"Yeah, I want this to sound fresh"
48:52;48:54;"Yeah, you're right, because Neil Young or Bob Dylan"
48:54;48:56;"Or George Harrison, whoever"
48:56;48:58;"If they had gone to a big studio"
48:58;49:00;"And said like, get this crap out of here"
49:00;49:02;"Bring back the old tape machine"
49:02;49:04;"I don't want anything digital in"
49:04;49:06;"You know, you'd probably have a bunch of like studio interns"
49:06;49:08;"Being like, oh, it's gonna be a f***ing long night"
49:08;49:10;"But whatever, they would do it"
49:10;49:12;"I think a big part of it too is like"
49:12;49:14;"And I'm a little bit out of my depth here, obviously I have some familiarity"
49:14;49:16;"With this stuff, but I'm not like a hardcore tech dude"
49:16;49:18;"And in fact, I know a few"
49:18;49:20;"People who really study the history of recording"
49:20;49:22;"Might be cool to have on the show one day"
49:22;49:24;"I also just feel like the tape machines"
49:24;49:26;"Changed, maybe some of the"
49:26;49:28;"Boards are probably the same, it's just like"
49:28;49:30;"This really subtle way that even"
49:30;49:32;"Music from the 80s"
49:32;49:34;"When they're not going for the big"
49:34;49:36;"Gated reverb on the drums or like"
49:36;49:38;"Using synth, these like very obvious"
49:38;49:40;"Things that connote 80s, even when they are using"
49:40;49:42;"Like acoustic instruments and"
49:42;49:44;"Probably the same players and the same"
49:44;49:46;"You know, the same drum kit, maybe"
49:46;49:48;"Even the same mics, I do think just like"
49:48;49:50;"The tape machines changed"
49:50;49:52;"Yeah, no, I know what you mean"
49:52;49:54;"And maybe very few"
49:54;49:56;"People at that time were like"
49:56;49:58;"Okay, here's a test, do you know"
49:58;50:00;"The Empire Burlesque album?"
50:00;50:02;"Vaguely. The last song on it is called"
50:02;50:04;"Dark Eyes, and that is"
50:04;50:06;"It's a Bob Dylan record we're talking about"
50:06;50:08;"The last song is just him"
50:08;50:10;"And acoustic, and maybe a harmonica"
50:10;50:12;"And it sounds like an old Bob Dylan song"
50:12;50:14;"So this is from '85"
50:14;50:16;"I'm curious to hear what this sounds like"
50:16;50:18;"And interestingly, I don't think this"
50:18;50:20;"He put a single song from Empire Burlesque"
50:20;50:22;"On Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3"
50:22;50:24;"So maybe he wasn't feeling it too much"
50:24;50:26;"But yeah, here's Dark Eyes"
50:28;50:32;"Already sounds 80s to me"
50:32;50:34;"I can hear it"
50:34;50:36;"Yes, yeah"
50:38;50:40;"The brightness"
50:40;50:42;"It honestly sounds 90s to me"
50:42;50:44;"Yeah, it does. He's ahead of his time"
50:48;50:50;"Oh, the gentlemen"
50:50;50:52;"Are"
50:52;50:54;"Talking"
50:56;50:58;"It's subtle"
50:58;51:00;"But I hear what you're saying"
51:00;51:02;"To me it's the brightness of the acoustic"
51:02;51:04;"That doesn't sound like the 70s"
51:04;51:06;"It might also be the digital tape they were probably using"
51:06;51:08;"Way less hiss and atmosphere"
51:20;51:22;"I was trying to do a freewheeling Bob Dylan thing"
51:22;51:24;"And I said let's do more of like"
51:24;51:26;"Empire Burlesque, Dark Eyes"
51:26;51:28;"Dark Eyes"
51:28;51:30;"It definitely doesn't sound 60s"
51:30;51:32;"I could see this being like 1978"
51:34;51:36;"Okay"
51:36;51:38;"But not 71"
51:38;51:40;"Yeah"
51:40;51:42;"Really picking nits here"
51:42;51:44;"I think 78 was when they first"
51:44;51:46;"Really started using"
51:46;51:48;"Kind of like digital"
51:48;51:50;"Well yeah, I mean think about like"
51:50;51:52;"Like Rumours doesn't sound"
51:52;51:54;"Like it's from the early 70s"
51:54;51:56;"It sounds"
51:56;51:58;"But it also doesn't sound like this"
52:02;52:04;"See that's what I'm saying"
52:04;52:06;"So that's a cool song"
52:06;52:08;"But you know, it's Bob, back to basics"
52:08;52:10;"60s elements, not trying to do"
52:10;52:12;"Not trying to keep up with"
52:12;52:14;"Duran Duran or whatever"
52:14;52:16;"Or even 80s Bruce Springsteen"
52:16;52:18;"And it still just sounds a little different"
52:18;52:20;"Well I thought of Springsteen because"
52:20;52:22;"Nebraska, but that was a consciously"
52:22;52:24;"That was lo-fi, because that was on cassette"
52:24;52:26;"Yeah, right"
52:26;52:28;"He was approaching that from a"
52:28;52:30;"Not from the vantage point of let me try to recreate"
52:30;52:32;"The sounds of 1972"
52:32;52:34;"They were demos essentially"
52:34;52:36;"Yeah but I guess"
52:36;52:38;"It has a different energy, like you wouldn't confuse Nebraska for a recording"
52:38;52:40;"From the early 70s"
52:40;52:42;"Just because the reverb is so crazy"
52:42;52:44;"Yes"
52:44;52:46;"But maybe in his own way"
52:46;52:48;"You know Bruce just being like"
52:48;52:50;"6 years younger than Bob"
52:50;52:52;"Something like that, you know"
52:52;52:54;"Born in 50 I think, and yeah Bob's like"
52:54;52:56;"42 maybe"
52:56;52:58;"I think Bruce is like 49"
52:58;53:00;"I'm pretty sure Bruce is 50"
53:00;53:02;"You think he was born in 1950?"
53:02;53:04;"I do"
53:04;53:06;"I'm sorry Jake, I hate to see you wipe out like this"
53:06;53:08;"But I guarantee Bruce is not born in 1950"
53:08;53:10;"How much do you want to bet?"
53:10;53:12;"Well because my dad was born in 1950"
53:12;53:14;"So there's no way"
53:14;53:16;"I would have looked at Bruce's"
53:16;53:18;"Wikipedia page and not"
53:18;53:20;"Clocked that they were both born in 1950"
53:20;53:22;"49"
53:22;53:24;"Ooh, ow, damn it"
53:24;53:26;"God"
53:26;53:28;"September 23rd though, so you're close"
53:28;53:30;"Just a couple months off"
53:30;53:32;"Why did I think 50?"
53:32;53:34;"No, you're right, September 23rd, 49 is basically 1950"
53:34;53:36;"But as Jake Welles knows"
53:36;53:38;"So near yet so far"
53:38;53:40;"To be born in 49"
53:40;53:42;"It's a different beast"
53:42;53:44;"I'm embarrassed"
53:44;53:46;"I feel like talking to my parents or my mom or something"
53:46;53:48;"When Tom Petty died, my mom pointed out"
53:48;53:50;"And you know what, he was born on the same day"
53:50;53:52;"As your dad"
53:52;53:54;"So he was only a year younger than Bruce?"
53:54;53:56;"Tom Petty?"
53:56;53:58;"Yeah, exactly, one year"
53:58;54:00;"So he was pretty old by the time he got truckin"
54:00;54:02;"Yeah, he was late 20s"
54:02;54:04;"Damn the Torpedoes was like 78 or something"
54:04;54:06;"Yeah, so he was like 28"
54:06;54:08;"Wow, that's old by that"
54:08;54:10;"By rock and roll standards of the 70s"
54:10;54:12;"He came in as a silverback"
54:14;54:16;"So I always remember that Tom Petty"
54:16;54:18;"Was the exact same age as my dad"
54:18;54:20;"To the day"
54:20;54:22;"I knew by process of elimination"
54:22;54:24;"That there was no way that Bruce was born in 50"
54:24;54:26;"And also, you know"
54:26;54:28;"I feel like when you're a real"
54:28;54:30;"Wikipedia music nerd head"
54:30;54:32;"You of course want to know"
54:32;54:34;"What year a record came out"
54:34;54:36;"And you also want to know how old the artist was"
54:36;54:38;"Of course"
54:38;54:40;"Music number crunch"
54:40;54:42;"You gotta know"
54:42;54:44;"So of course, I always know in my head that"
54:44;54:46;"Bob was born in"
54:46;54:48;"41"
54:48;54:50;"So he's 50 in 1991"
54:50;54:52;"Yeah"
54:52;54:54;"And it's also amazing to think he was so young"
54:54;54:56;"When the early records came out"
54:56;54:58;"He was"
54:58;55:00;"21?"
55:00;55:02;"He might have been 21 when he recorded Free Will and Bob Dylan"
55:02;55:04;"Maybe 22 Tops"
55:04;55:06;"It's also wild too to think about"
55:06;55:08;"When you think about Waves and Blood on the Tracks"
55:08;55:10;"He was like 33, 34"
55:10;55:12;"That comes to mind a lot"
55:12;55:14;"Because especially in Bob's career"
55:14;55:16;"Those are his"
55:16;55:18;"Mature divorce albums"
55:18;55:20;"When you think about Bob"
55:20;55:22;"When you're a kid and you might hear something about"
55:22;55:24;"Blood on the Tracks"
55:24;55:26;"You think about that and maybe you're starting to poke around"
55:26;55:28;"On early Bob Dylan stuff"
55:28;55:30;"You know Blood on the Tracks"
55:30;55:32;"You kind of think, well, yeah"
55:32;55:34;"I'll be ready for that in about 50 years"
55:34;55:36;"But in a way, Blood on the Tracks"
55:36;55:38;"When you're young, it almost seems like a record that was made by"
55:38;55:40;"A 50 year old"
55:40;55:42;"It's very adult"
55:42;55:44;"It's not even just grown up, it's like grown up and been through this"
55:44;55:46;"Crazy life cycle event"
55:46;55:48;"Anyway, that comes to mind a lot because"
55:48;55:50;"Jake, you'd been talking about not that long ago"
55:50;55:52;"Watching the Machine Gun Kelly documentary"
55:52;55:54;"That made me want to watch it"
55:54;55:56;"That's right"
55:56;55:58;"And I couldn't help it maybe just because I'd been listening to a lot of Bob"
55:58;56:00;"And I was like, alright, so Machine Gun Kelly's like"
56:00;56:02;"32"
56:02;56:04;"So if he was Bob Dylan, he'd be"
56:04;56:06;"Gearing up to make Planet Waves"
56:06;56:08;"Right now"
56:08;56:10;"And a year from now when Machine Gun Kelly's"
56:10;56:12;"Making his next album"
56:12;56:14;"He's basically in the Blood on the Tracks era"
56:14;56:16;"But you know, Bob Dylan kind of blows the curve"
56:16;56:18;"For everybody"
56:18;56:20;"I mean, I'm old"
56:20;56:22;"When Bob was my age, he was making"
56:22;56:24;"I'm 38"
56:24;56:26;"He was making Slow Train Comin'"
56:26;56:28;"There's a slow"
56:28;56:30;"Slow train comin'"
56:30;56:32;"Let's just throw in a little, what songs should I put on from Nebraska"
56:32;56:34;"Like Atlantic City"
56:34;56:36;"State Trooper"
56:36;56:38;"My name is Joe Roberts"
56:38;56:40;"Is that Highway Patrolman?"
56:40;56:42;"I think so, I don't know the titles"
56:42;56:48;"This has so much more atmosphere"
56:48;56:50;"Than that Dark Eyes"
56:50;56:52;"Empire Burlesque"
56:52;56:54;"The slap back on the vocals"
56:54;56:56;"I'm a sergeant"
56:56;56:58;"Out of Birdville"
56:58;57:00;"Barracks number 8"
57:00;57:06;"I always done an honest job"
57:06;57:10;"His honest death"
57:10;57:12;"This record rules"
57:12;57:14;"It's not like my favorite Bruce album"
57:14;57:16;"And yet"
57:16;57:18;"I'll weirdly say like"
57:18;57:20;"This album is what glues his whole career together"
57:20;57:22;"There's something about this album"
57:22;57:24;"When it came out"
57:24;57:26;"The way he made it, the cover"
57:26;57:28;"Is why"
57:28;57:30;"He would have so many great songs without it"
57:30;57:32;"And yet if you took this out of his discography"
57:32;57:34;"I feel like it all crumbles"
57:34;57:36;"If it goes from the river to Born in the USA"
57:36;57:38;"It's not nearly as interesting"
57:38;57:40;"Having the weird"
57:40;57:42;"Lo-fi record right in the middle"
57:42;57:48;"And also you know what's interesting to me"
57:48;57:50;"Is that you think about like Bruce"
57:50;57:52;"Deciding to let these demos go"
57:52;57:54;"Of course it doesn't actually sound like it's from"
57:54;57:56;"The early 60's"
57:56;57:58;"And yet you could imagine Bruce having just been"
57:58;58:00;"At a high end studio"
58:00;58:02;"With a friend of the show Jimmy Iovine"
58:02;58:06;"Friend of the Apple Music Organization"
58:06;58:08;"Jimmy Iovine"
58:08;58:10;"You know he'd just been recording the river"
58:10;58:12;"You could imagine Bruce being like"
58:12;58:14;"This kind of like infamous stickler"
58:14;58:16;"Obsessive dude"
58:16;58:18;"And if you've ever seen the documentary about the river"
58:18;58:20;"You know they're like going so hard on it"
58:20;58:22;"You could picture him like"
58:22;58:24;"See this sounds like 1980"
58:24;58:26;"This sounds more like Dark Eyes"
58:26;58:28;"Yeah yeah, this is 80's"
58:28;58:30;"Digital tape vibe"
58:30;58:32;"So you could imagine Bruce having done this"
58:32;58:34;"And being like happy with this album"
58:34;58:36;"But also being like"
58:36;58:38;"I want something that has like the energy of like the early"
58:38;58:40;"Records I was into"
58:40;58:42;"Bob Dylan, early rock and roll whatever"
58:42;58:44;"And maybe he just found at that point"
58:44;58:46;"It'd be insane to like go in with like"
58:46;58:48;"Ask Jimmy Iovine at the high end"
58:48;58:50;"You know hit factory or wherever they made this"
58:50;58:52;"He just realized the closest thing he could get"
58:52;58:54;"At that moment was"
58:54;58:56;"Using the 4-track tape recorder"
58:56;58:58;"Yeah I read the memoir I'm trying to"
58:58;59:00;"Remember if that was, if he had specifically"
59:00;59:02;"Addressed that cause it is almost like yeah"
59:02;59:04;"Like I could picture him thinking about like"
59:04;59:06;"Buddy Holly or Roy Orbison"
59:06;59:08;"Not that Nebraska sounds like"
59:08;59:10;"Those artists, but"
59:10;59:12;"A comparable recording situation"
59:12;59:14;"And I guess that's what's cool and also why like"
59:14;59:16;"You know you even think about"
59:16;59:18;"Chillwave"
59:18;59:20;"I guess that's kind of an outdated term but you know"
59:20;59:22;"Chillwave which has"
59:22;59:24;"In a way morphed into"
59:24;59:26;"This lo-fi hip hop beats"
59:26;59:28;"To study to type music"
59:28;59:30;"Arguably Chillwave"
59:30;59:32;"Has cast a really like long"
59:32;59:34;"Shadow and a lot of it was based on samples"
59:34;59:36;"And you kind of realize Chillwave in a way"
59:36;59:38;"I think was also"
59:38;59:40;"Artists trying to"
59:40;59:42;"Capture a vibey analog"
59:42;59:44;"Feel from music they grew up with"
59:44;59:46;"But of course now they're doing it in Ableton"
59:46;59:48;"And Pro Tools and using samples"
59:48;59:50;"And stretching stuff out"
59:50;59:52;"So you know it's like trying to get back to that sound"
59:52;59:54;"And yet because you're in the modern world"
59:54;59:56;"It turns into something different"
59:56;59:58;"But it's also like a good reminder how sometimes"
59:58;01:00:00;"Looking backwards and quote unquote"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"Nostalgia actually"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Produces something"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You know you almost like can't worry about it too much"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Like you know if you love the Tasteful Palette"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"Of the 1970s like"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"Yeah go ahead try to recreate it right now"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"You'll get something different"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"You'll get Mountain Bruce"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Yeah the best"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Which you would not confuse for 70s music"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"The best of the old and the new"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"What's going on with that Mountain Bruce vinyl do you want to plug that in for a second"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"That's coming out in October"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"I think we're going to do pre-orders in August sometime"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Looking good"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"The art's amazing"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"We actually got the physical release"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"You got the physical release?"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Got the art for the physical release"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"And it looks great"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"First ever physical release"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Wait because how long has Mountain Bruce been going now like"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"5 years?"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"3, 2019"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Was when the first one dropped"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"3 years in, first physical release"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Yup, double"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"So did you throw it on? On the sound system at home?"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Got the test pressings"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Sound pretty good"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Pretty good"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"This is the full catalog on vinyl, this is every song"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"It's coming out"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Double album, self titled Mountain Bruce"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"You doing merch? We'll do some merch"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"So because this 2 LP set"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"Is the material from the"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"First 4 Mountain Bruce EPs"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"In your mind and in your marketing"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"Materials, do you refer to this"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"As a compilation?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Or you just say it's finally here"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Mountain Bruce debut album"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"No it's a comp"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"It's kind of how the weekend started"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Really? Right?"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"You want to weigh in on some Canadian musical history?"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"I mean you said it all"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"It's just how the weekend did it"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"He did the mix tapes"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"Then he put them all together in an album"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"I mean you're really following the weekend model"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"I just mean the weekend did 4 EPs"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Of the tasteful"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"70's inspired country folk rock"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"And then compiled them"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"On a 2 LP set"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"He put out a bunch of EPs"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"And then his first long player"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Was all the EPs"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Together"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"And then he made his first debut album"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"So will you be releasing the double"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"On streaming services as one album?"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"No"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"I think it's a mistake"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"I don't know it seems like you're"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Leaving a lot of money on the table"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I've looked over those Mountain Bruce"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Sales numbers and let me tell you"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"We're not"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"I mean I think Mountain Bruce is doing pretty good numbers"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"For pure self released"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"The song Mountain Bruce"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Definitely does strong numbers"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"I don't think there's anything surprising"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"The song Mountain Bruce has it's own life"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"And also just to contextualize"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"If Mountain Bruce is doing numbers on other"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"Streaming services that really says a lot"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"When you consider that"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"So many Mountain Bruce fans"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Like all good hearted people are"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Listening to Apple music"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Cause there probably like some people who"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Heard we debuted some"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Sweet Chili Heat premieres"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"I imagine you got a ton of Apple music listeners"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"You know what else would be classic though?"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"And I don't know"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"What the plan is for other territories"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"That's some stuff you'd totally be reading"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Like going down some rabbit hole reading about"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Somebody's career and be like"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"They released the first four EPs in America"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Which was presented as a collection"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"For the US market"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"But in the Philippines"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"That's generally seen as Mountain Bruce's"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"First debut album"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Because nobody"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Like nobody heard Bruce in the Philippines"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Until the two album set dropped"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"There was zero awareness"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"That those were four EPs"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"So generally when"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"Filipino music historians are looking at the"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Bruce discography they count that as"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"A studio album"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"There was an influential DJ"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"In the Philippines that"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Got the vinyl"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Started spinning"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"He started with side three Raising a Place"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"That's right"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"Raising a Place really struck a nerve"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Disc one was damaged so he actually never"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Was able to play"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"The original Mountain Bruce stuff"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"He only did Raising a Place and Down to the Studs"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Wait so is this two album set"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Is it just called Mountain Bruce?"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"It's just called Mountain Bruce"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Alright so you can see the confusion"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Lot of confusion"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"On Wikipedia"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Mountain Bruce disambiguation page"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Mountain Bruce can refer to"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"The musical project"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Mountain Bruce"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"The 2019 EP"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"Mountain Bruce"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"The 2022 collection Mountain Bruce"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"Or the social phenomenon"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Of Mountain Bruce"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Or literal Mountain Bruce"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"Because I should also mention that there is a brewery"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"In Ohio called Modern Methods Brewery"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"That is putting out"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"Mountain Bruce"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"In conjunction with the release?"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Around the same time it just worked out timing wise"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Did you design the can?"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"The can is the record cover"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Sick"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Of the Eagle with the six pack ring"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"Wow"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"And the Mountains"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Did you have to approve the samples?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Haven't tasted it yet"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"What if you hate it?"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"I'll love it"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"It's the riffing on Wurst Marg"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"And I'm just trying to hold on"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Wait wait it's a margarita flavored beer?"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"No no no"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Well while Jake searches I'll just throw out"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"That the 1975 the band"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"On their debut album"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"The 1975 is called The 1975"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"No I think every album they do"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"Starts with"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"It has a song called The 1975"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"Oh really?"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"I thought you were going to say it's called Mountain Bruce"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"That would be way cooler"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"Okay Mountain Bruce"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"Key lime pilsner 4.5%"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"A pilsner fermented with the key lime"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"And blue agave with a crack of sea salt"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"For the crispiest of crispy"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Fruited lagers"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"I can tell you I don't know if you're going to like that"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"We brewed this to be the best beer"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"For when you can't get your hands on the worst margarita"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"Of my life"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"Well look either way whether Jake loves it or hates it"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"It still tracks"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"No it's great I'm just saying how confidently and quickly"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"He said I'm going to love it"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"Well Jake loves beer"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"I'm psyched on this key lime pilsner"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"4.5% I respect the lower alcohol"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Wait when's it coming out?"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Because this sounds perfect for summer"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"It's coming out soon like what do these guys say?"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Here's my last email"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Love this timeline"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"(laughter)"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"Did you write that or you wrote that?"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I wrote to them"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Love this timeline"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"I'm just trying to"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"That was you doing an impression of you"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"(laughter)"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"So heightened"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Hey Jake we were thinking about tweaking"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"The amount of key lime we put in"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Next email"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"I don't give a f*** I just want the money"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Going to be brewing the pilsner"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"In the next"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"So this was on July 9th this email"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Going to be brewing the pilsner"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"In the next two weeks which puts a release out"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"In two months give or take"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"Physical?"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"I think we're getting this Mountain Brews brew in like mid late September"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"And this is real beer"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"This is not like an NFT"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"This is not an NFT this is a real beer"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"It's going to be in 16 ounce cans"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"With the Mountain Brews"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Double LP artwork on the can"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Available where?"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"An Ohio based beer themed NFT producer"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Has teamed up"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"(laughter)"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"American Painter radio personality"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"They're based out of Ohio I think Warren, Ohio"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"I'm not sure"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Modern Methods Brewing Company"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"I love the name that's such a good name"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"But do they have national distribution or"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"It's only in Ohio or Midwest"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"I don't know I don't know what their distro situation is"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Well any you can get"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"You know there are people shipping beer everywhere"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"Ship some out to me you know"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"I'm not too worried about someone like"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Can someone go into a cool liquor store"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"In uh"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Odessa Texas and buy"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"Mountain Brews probably not"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"That's okay though"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"You're just like sending them irate emails"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"My friend from college lives in Portland"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"Just walked in"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"Just went to their local bar"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"They did not"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Never even heard of it"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"What are you guys doing"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"I'm in the Whole Foods in Pasadena"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And I'm not seeing it"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"(laughter)"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"What's up"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"Every bodega in Brooklyn"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Yeah we've talked about that before it is so mysterious"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"How I mean clearly"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"I think it's because like one or two companies"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Own everything"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"But how you know just one day"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"You roll into some like"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Random gas station"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"Or you know"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"CVS somewhere and just like"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"Suddenly they have"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Some kind of like Whole Foods looking product"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"What we talked about"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"With Kind Granola"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"You know like suddenly you're just in like a CVS"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"In Warren Ohio"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"And you just see like huge bags of"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Kind Granola"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"And you're just like"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"How did this one"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Why was this the one to make it"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"And I think it's almost always because the distribution channels"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Are controlled by a few"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Companies like"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Dr. Gamble or something"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Yeah they bought it so now that one's there"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Well maybe things will pan out"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"For modern methods I don't know"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Either way very cool"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"Absolutely"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"We'll have to drink that on air"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"That's going to be a huge episode"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Absolutely it's going to be a huge moment"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"Alright so Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"So you know"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Part of the reason that we're doing this is"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"I've been listening to this in particular a lot"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"That's something I don't listen to"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Bob Dylan's Hits albums that often"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Especially in the streaming era"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"I'm not often listening to just like the best of playlist"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Or anything and yet there's something about"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Because it covers so much of his"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"Like weird years"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"The 80's I just find it to be such a fascinating"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Collection and I think it's also just a good way in"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"For people"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"Who are kind of like the casual Dylan fan"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"You know they know all the classic albums"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"And just like yeah I don't know any of that 80's stuff"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Well it's also a lot of the 70's"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"There's 73 to 91"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"There's a bunch of 70's stuff too"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"And so I guess the first thing you need to understand about Bob Dylan"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"And his relationship to the Greatest Hits format"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Is that"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"You know as with his Taylor Swift comment"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"He's a very playful"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Strange guy"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"You know he is"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"Or he sometimes maybe is"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"Embodies the Joker man"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"And so even if you go back to Bob Dylan's"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"Greatest Hits"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Volume 2"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"Which came out"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"Bob Dylan first released a Greatest Hits album in 1967"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"And if you look at that one"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"It's 10 songs"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"It's like pretty straight forward"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Opens with Rainy Day Woman number 12 and 35"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"Which was kind of like a chart hit"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"I think that's like a well known Bob Dylan song"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"Everybody must get stoned"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"And then"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Track 2"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"Blown in the wind"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"How many roads must a man walk"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"Yeah it makes sense"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Track 3"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"The times they are a changin'"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"Come gather 'round people"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"Wherever you roam"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"You know you keep going through"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"And it's like you get to It Ain't Me Babe"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"Like a Rolling Stone, Mr. Tambourine Man"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"You can take some issue"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"But it's like these are his best known songs of that era"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Positively 4th Street"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"A big single"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"So that's like a great way for a fan who"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"Loves that song but doesn't have the single"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"To you know listen to it on an LP"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Okay"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Then in 71"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"When Bob has been through quite a bit"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"He's experienced"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"What Lady Gaga aptly called"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"The Fame Monster"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"He'd been in a motorcycle accident"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"He'd watched as some of his"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"Ideas and people inspired by him"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"Gave birth to kind of the whole hippie"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Late 60s thing which obviously he was like"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Wanted to keep at arm's length"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"He declined to play Woodstock"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"You know he was entering this phase where he was kind of"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"This like OG"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"Even though you know by 71 he's only 30"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Years old but he probably felt really old at that"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Point and he was probably seeing some flower"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Power stuff and actually feeling like he was"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"A million years old"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Anyway at this point he's putting together"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"His Greatest Hits Volume 2"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"First song on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 2"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Watching the River Flow"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Honestly don't know it"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"Look and if Jake doesn't know it"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I only know it because"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"He played it at the"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Stage this and I was like looking later and I was like"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"What was that song? Wait play it"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"This is track one on Greatest Hits Volume 2"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"Is this off Self Portrait?"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"No I don't think this was on an album"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Uh huh"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"What's the matter with me?"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"I don't have much to say"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Daylight sneaking through the window"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"And I'm still in this"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Cold night cafe"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Yeah this collection is very weird"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Yeah I guess this was like a single"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"The same year that this"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Came out and also just"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"To open with it"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"It's a little clunky the dunk gah gah"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"And then he gets into some"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Don't Think Twice It's Alright, Lay Lady Lay"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"But even Don't Think Twice It's Alright"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"Is funny because it's like that's from"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"Freewheeling like he already"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Released the Greatest Hits"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Right, that covers this era"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"Yeah so it doesn't have that like"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"The Beatles Greatest Hits type"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Standardization where it's like this era"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"These are the biggest singles they released"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"And then in this era you know"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"Yeah this is just all over the place"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"All over the place, Lay Lady Lay"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"Then you get stuck inside a mobile"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"With Mephiles again which is from"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Blonde on Blonde?"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"Or is it from uh, I think it's from Blonde on Blonde"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Which also was covered by the last one"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"So it's kind of all over the place"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Listen to those drums Taylor"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Crisp"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Yeah it's all of it"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"It's going from that back to uh"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Natural Skyline era"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"And then you get this, a song Jake knows well"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Because I believe he's sung it"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Live"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"This is just an unreleased song"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"He just started throwing unreleased songs on his"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Greatest Hits which is some"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Really wild behavior"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Great Dead covers of this song"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"So the Dead played this all the time"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"As did Richard Pictures"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"It's really like a centerpiece of the Richard Pictures show"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"And you sing this right?"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Oh yeah"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Like I can understand"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Stopping one unreleased song on your Greatest Hits"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Just to be like, and here's a little bonus"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"But he has like three or four on this"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Yeah I mean you ain't going nowhere"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"Had been covered by the Birds"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"Right"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"On Sweetheart of the Rodeo"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"But his version wasn't out"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I don't think his version of I Shall Be Released was out either"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"No, only the band"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"And then, so clearly Bob"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Enjoys the Greatest Hits"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Format as a way to"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"I wonder if in his mind he's kind of just like having fun with it"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"By just being like"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Oh yeah, and you know"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"A whole bunch of my Greatest Hits from that era"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"You actually never heard them before"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"Or if maybe he was just thinking"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"He could kind of like retroactively make these hits"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"You know, give them a little pride of place"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"On the Greatest Hits"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Either way, it's unusual because there's a lot of artists"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Who'll put out a kind of like odds and ends type compilation"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Yeah"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Which is maybe where you would normally find a song"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Like when I paint my masterpiece"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"I like what you're saying"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"I feel like it's the children"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"When I got these"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Greatest Hits"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"As, you know, someone who's listening"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"Finding it in my parents' collection"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"And I were to put this on, I go"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"Whoa, when I paint my masterpiece"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"It must be one of his biggest songs ever"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"It's on his Greatest Hits"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"And then now I'm telling people"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"You know, that he created it"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"That's a very cool idea"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Is that he basically canonized songs no one had ever heard of"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Yeah"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"He's like, ""I'm gonna make the Greatest Hits"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"So when the next generation finds this compilation"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"They hold this up and they go, ""This was it"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"This was the best he did"""
01:16:10;01:16:12;"And think about it, yeah, with the Greatest Hits"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Especially with somebody with so many albums"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"A lot of people would gravitate towards the Greatest Hits"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"It's just a way to understand it"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"So just imagine how many people probably grabbed his Greatest Hits Vol. 2"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"And the first song they heard is"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Watching the River Flow"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"Which, grab any boomer on the street"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Who'd profess to be a Bob Dylan fan"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"I'm not talking about the people who like"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"The hardcore Dylanologists"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"I'm just saying, grab some old dude off the street"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"You're like, ""Bob Dylan?"" ""Oh, absolutely, man"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"'60s, yeah"""
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Just be like, ""Watching the River Flow"""
01:16:40;01:16:42;"A lot of them are just gonna be like, ""Oh, not familiar with that one"""
01:16:42;01:16:44;"And maybe it kinda worked"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"That now some people are more familiar"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"With these songs"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"But by the time you get to His Greatest Hits Vol. 3"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"It's really wild"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Because, yeah, maybe he just wanted to take control"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Of the narrative, which makes a lot of sense"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"He famously is a guy who felt"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"Kind of misunderstood by the press"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Felt like he was kinda"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Forced into a box"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"You could imagine him wanting to be"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Tell his own story with his Greatest Hits"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"Even if it starts to undermine"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"The concept of a hit"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"So anyway, that's all the backstory"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"To lead us up to Bob Dylan's"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Greatest Hits Vol. 3"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Which is what I recommend"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"For the casual Bob fan"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"Who's ready to take it one step deeper"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Maybe you're not ready to listen to Empire Burlesque"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Front to back"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Few are"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"This is your way in"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"So Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. 3"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"When did this come out? This came out in the 90s"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"'94"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"So '94, Bob Dylan's 53 years old"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Hadn't had his kind of like"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"Commercial, critical renaissance yet"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"That he had with Time Out of Mind"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"And his kinda like old dude albums"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Where people were like, ""Oh yeah, Bob"""
01:17:52;01:17:54;"So this is kind of a random period for him"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"But in '94, Bob's really thinking"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"A lot about how does he want"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"To tell the story"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Of the past 20 years of his career"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"'Cause, you know, there's a lot of ways he could do it"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"So he opens up with"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"I think a pretty classic"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"Big hit for him. He's not being quite as weird"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"As opening up with Watching the River Flow"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"He opens up with Tangled Up in Blue"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Which is from an album"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"That's generally considered one of his all-time greats"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Blood on the Tracks"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"This has been one of my favorite Bob songs"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Of maybe the last year or so"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"Oh, it's interesting 'cause on the Jokerman pod"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"You talk about how you prefer"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Planet Waves"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"I do, as a record"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"But this is one of my favorite"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"Bob songs, I think"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"That's a great song"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"I love that East Coast shout-out"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"[Laughter]"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"I wonder if he plays that"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"In like, on the Eastern Seaboard"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"And is like, ""Woo!"""
01:19:10;01:19:12;"""East Coast!"""
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Playing it in Delaware"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"""Woo!"""
01:19:16;01:19:18;"""It's time to be divorced!"""
01:19:18;01:19:20;"""I helped her out of a jam, I guess"""
01:19:20;01:19:22;"I mean, yeah, this is just like"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"All these vignettes"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"People pontificate on this song"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"For decades, but"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"To me, it's just like, yeah, the most vivid"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Storytelling"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"In a song"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"All these different stories"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Don't even seem like the same person"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"Interrelated, and then just wrapping it up"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"With this turn of phrase"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"""Tangled Up in Blue"""
01:19:44;01:19:46;"I take it for granted, because this song is so familiar"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"But when you really think about it"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"And think about how at this moment"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"In the 70s, he would have known"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"A billion songs where people talk about"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Feeling blue, or being blue"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"And he just does a slight"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Tweak to it, ""Tangled Up in Blue"""
01:20:00;01:20:02;"And just immediately feels so different"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Is ""Tangled Up in Blue"" meaning"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"You're just like, feeling bummed?"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Doesn't sound quite like that"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"It sounds like, weirder"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"It sounds like you're interacting with a weird"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"""Tangled Up in Blue"""
01:20:14;01:20:16;"It's just like, a different feeling"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"Yeah, it's a little, like, messier"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"Than just being like, ""I'm down"""
01:20:20;01:20:22;"Yeah, 'cause getting tangled up"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Almost feels like you're fighting with something"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"It's like, a little more chaotic"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Tangled up"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Tangled up in blue"
01:20:30;01:20:40;"She was working in a topless place"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"And I stopped in for a beer"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"I just kept looking at the side of her face"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"And the spotlight so clear"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Later on, when the crowd thinned out"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"I was just about to do the same"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"She was standing there"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"In back of my chair"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"I said, ""Timmy, don't I know your name?"""
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I murdered something underneath my breath"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"She studied the lines on my face"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"I must admit, felt a little uneasy"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"When she bent down to tie the lace"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"Of my shoes"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Tangled up in blue"
01:21:13;01:21:17;"Quick question about the ""Greatest Hits"" format"
01:21:17;01:21:20;"Typically, does the artist pick their songs?"
01:21:20;01:21:24;"I've always sort of thought of it as a record label sort of cash grab"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Oh, that's a good point"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"I think sometimes the record label could"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Bob's been on the same label"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Also the current home of Vampire Weekend"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Columbia Records"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"For his entire career"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Very unusual"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"He was signed to Columbia Records"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"In the early 60s"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"And he's still on Columbia Records now"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"Amazing"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"He survived the purchase of Columbia Records"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"By the Japanese conglomerate, Sony"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"And he's been there the whole time"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"So you would imagine he has"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Sometimes you hear these stories where like"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Like famously the Red Hot Chili Peppers"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"I think they're on Warner Brothers"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"And then they bounced"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"And then they made Blood Sugar Sex Magic for somebody else"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"And then Warner, seeing how big they got"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Compiled all their 80s stuff"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"And just made like a weird ""Greatest Hits"""
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Cause I kind of remember coming across"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"What hits by the Red Hot Chili Peppers"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"And just being like, where's all the good sh*t?"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Kind of"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Anyway, so Bob opens with ""Tangled Up In Blue"""
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Classic song"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"And like, you know, I think a fairly successful single in the 70s"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"It also just reminds me of a thought that I've had"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"Sometimes with Bob"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"When you think about how Bob was"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"So influential to the"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Other artists around him"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"The people who were slightly later"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Or just after him, or a tiny bit younger"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"I always find it's interesting for me to think about"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"Like all kind of music"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Tweebs, you can obsess so much about"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"The Beatles and the Stones"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"And what they were doing, and wow"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"And then the Beatles decided they started smoking weed"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Or then they got into Indian music and they made these choices"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"I've also found it very interesting"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"To sometimes think about what Bob Dylan"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Was doing a few months before"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"They made that record"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"It suddenly just contextualizes stuff"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"And I guess this is pretty obvious, but sometimes"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"When I listen to the records I feel it more"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"When you picture the Beatles making ""Rubber Soul"""
01:23:08;01:23:10;"A kind of artistic breakthrough"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"And doing like Norwegian wood"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"I think John Sett was kind of doing a Bob Dylan thing"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"And you picture them trying to like"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"Experiment a little bit more"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"And then you listen to the records that Bob Dylan made in 1965"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"And you think about them listening to like"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Like a Rolling Stone or Desolation Row"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"I might have the math a little bit off"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"But more or less"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"That's '65"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Yeah, I'm just saying, I don't know which albums came out before ""Rubber Soul"""
01:23:32;01:23:34;"And just suddenly you picture them"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"Hearing those songs"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"You can suddenly imagine how they probably felt like"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Kind of like dorks"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"And then you even just picture this point"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"'75, all those guys just listening to Bob drop"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"Like ""Tangled Up in Blue"""
01:23:46;01:23:48;"And just, you know, he was like"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"Always probably seemed a few steps"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"Ahead, like even when people were doing"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Great work and then Bob just like dropped something like that"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"That probably always provided a bit"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Of an inspiration or even"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"A competitive spirit or something"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"And that's because he always just seemed like"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"Artistically like 10 or 20 years older"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"They're listening to Highway 61"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"And they're just like ""Damn, that's out of tune"""
01:24:08;01:24:10;"They left it like that?"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"That is the most"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Just be like ""This is baller"""
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Yeah, exactly, just like ""Wow"""
01:24:16;01:24:18;"They didn't have the term ""punk"" really but like"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"Damn, Bob went hard with leaving that"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Those guitars are so out of tune"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"On that record"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"Queen Jane approximately"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"You put that on and you're just like"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"That is wild"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"It's raw, but I need to get into the weeds for a second"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"Seinfeld, tell me what date"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"Did the Beatles album ""Help"" come out?"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"I love this"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"We need to really get into some"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"Granular mid-60s rock history, let's go"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"1965"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"What's the date though?"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"Well, in the US"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"In the US it was"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"July 19th"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"How about in the Philippines?"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Oh, Philippines, 1987?"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"No"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"UK"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"July 23rd, 1965"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Ok, so I want to point out"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"Because back then, records, it seemed like they would turn them in"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"There were none of these supply chain issues"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"No"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"They would be on vinyl in stores like weeks later"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"Two weeks later"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"So, bring it all back home"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"The Bob Dylan album, his first electric album"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Came out March 22nd, '65"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"So they're probably like starting to"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"They might not even been to the studio yet for ""Help"""
01:25:24;01:25:26;"But they're starting to gear up for that, working on ""Help"""
01:25:26;01:25:28;"And then they hear ""Bring it all back home"""
01:25:28;01:25:30;"For Bob Dylan, and you just picture like"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Subterranean blues"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"And just picture it, you're the Beatles, you're some of the greatest songwriters of all time"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"And"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"You're even kind of getting into new territory"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Even ""Help"", they are getting into new territory"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"Even the song ""Help"", it's like"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"That couldn't have been on the early"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"""Help, I need somebody"""
01:25:46;01:25:48;"You're like trying to express this kind of like"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"Slightly more sophisticated emotion"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"A type of anxiety"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"You know, something that you wouldn't have if you didn't want to hold your hand"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"So you're working on that"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"And it is cool, but then you just hear"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Like ""Danny's in the basement mixing"""
01:26:00;01:26:02;"It's like, I'm sure somebody"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"With a different vantage point could say ""No, no, that thing helps way cooler"""
01:26:04;01:26:06;"But I'm saying at that time"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"You would just hear Bob Dylan's new record"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Opens with subterranean homesick blues"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"""Danny's in the basement thinking about the government"""
01:26:12;01:26:14;"You would just be like ""What the hell is this?"""
01:26:14;01:26:16;"If you were cool, you'd probably feel a little bit like"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"Behind"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"And then you start trying to catch up, then later that year you write"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"""Norwegian Wood"" but then he's dropping ""Like a Rolling Stone"""
01:26:22;01:26:24;"And again, I'm not saying that"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"The Bob songs are better"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"I'm just saying if you're kind of like"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"You know, an artsy"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Depressive type like a John Lennon"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"You'd probably just always feel a little bit like"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"You know, just like"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"Dude's on another level"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"But people didn't feel that way in the late 70s"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Track 2 on ""Greatest Hits"""
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Volume 3, so this is interesting"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"So it opens with ""Tango in Blue"", totally normal"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Then track 2, ""Changing of the Guards"""
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Hell yeah"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"So this is a great song, one that actually"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"I think your brother Dave introduced me to"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"I have this memory of when we all lived in a house in Brooklyn"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Like when I was a teacher"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"Hearing Dave like working on"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Probably ""Rise Above"""
01:27:02;01:27:04;"And I feel like he was always"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Blasting ""Changing of the Guards"""
01:27:06;01:27:08;"And at first I would like"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Kind of hear it through the floor"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"And I'd hear the saxophone and be like ""Is this Bruce?"""
01:27:12;01:27:14;"And then be like ""What is it?"""
01:27:14;01:27:16;"Because I didn't know it was Street Legal at all"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"And it was not a particularly respected album"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"For a long time"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"The heads love it now"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"So anyway, track 2 he's already getting like, you know, interesting"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"""Changing of the Guards"""
01:27:26;01:27:30;"And also he's skipping ahead"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"He could easily have put out"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Two songs from ""Blood on the Tracks"""
01:27:34;01:27:36;"And then one from ""Desire"""
01:27:36;01:27:44;"""16 Banners United Over the Fields"""
01:27:44;01:27:46;"I love that"
01:27:46;01:27:58;"That was on his record"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Two days ago"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"Front to back"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Blasting"
01:28:04;01:28:12;"He played this one a bunch in '78"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"""Break In"""
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Not a single concert since then"
01:28:16;01:28:32;"I wonder what"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"The problem was in 1978"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"With the rock critics"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"Why were they crapping on this so hard?"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Bring up that Robert Criscale review"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"Of ""Changing of the Guards"""
01:28:42;01:28:46;"This is so Bruce"
01:28:46;01:28:56;"I think"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"He also did this big tour around this era"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Where he had a huge band"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"And he had the female backup singers"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Saxophones"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Probably like 15 people on stage"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Maybe for these critics"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Who grew up with Dylan"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"And thought he was the epitome of cool"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"There was even something about him"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"Using the backup singers"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"And the saxophone"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"That kind of connoted"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"Showbiz glitz or something"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"And they couldn't really look at the songs the same way"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"And also he was coming off the back of a really strong run"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"""Blood on the Tracks"""
01:29:28;01:29:30;"Into ""Desire"""
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Into this"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"And this is dope"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"And that's why I think"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"They were cheering this song on the greatest hits"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"But they probably felt like this was"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"A letdown after those"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"Robert, our boy Robert gave it a C+"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Too low man"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Greal Marcus is the one who reviewed it for Rolling Stone"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"Yeah?"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"It saddens me that I can't find it in my heart"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"To agree with my colleague Dave Marsh"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"That Bob Dylan's new record is a joke"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Or in any way a good one"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"Most of the stuff here is dead air"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Or close to it"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"The novelty of the music"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Bob Marley's I3s"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Funk riffs from the band"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Lots of laconic sax work"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"Quickly fades as one realizes how indifferent the playing is"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"Inveterate rock and rollers"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Learn to find charm"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"In boastful, secretly girl-shy adolescence"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"But boozy-voiced"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Misogynists in their late 30s"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"Are a straight drag"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"This divorcee sounds overripe"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Too in love with his own self-generated"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Misery to break through the leaden"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Tempos that oppress his melodies"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Devoid not just of humor"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"But of lightness"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Unless that is he intends his Neil Diamond masquerade"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"As a joke"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"Yeah, see, they're comparing it disfavorably to Neil Diamond"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"They're saying he's old"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"He's out of touch, he's a misogynist"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"And the truth is, he went"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"It's funny to hear this, and then"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Jake, have you ever actually listened to Bob Dylan at Budokan?"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Which he put out the next year?"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"Because this is when he really went into that"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"I can understand why the critics"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Couldn't get down with this"
01:31:02;01:31:06;"I mean, I kind of love it, but this is like"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Bob, 1979, older dude"
01:31:08;01:31:14;"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"You hear a 60s hit"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"That flute?"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"I mean, because the original Mr. Tambourine Man"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"It's like, so austere"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"And vibey"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Yeah, the flute's pretty funny"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Yeah, the flute is"
01:31:32;01:31:38;"It seems that they hate the singing"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I mean, that's really"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"It's like the vocal quality, the way in which he's singing"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"That seems to be a big"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"They hate the singing on Street Legal?"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Yeah"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Look, I can understand if critics said"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Street Legal is spotty"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"There are like some obvious bright spots"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"Changing of the guards, hell of a song, senior"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Tales of Yankee Power"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Vibey, cool song, I can understand if they're just like"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Mixed, but they're like"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"Seem like they're really hating on it"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"Knives out, knives out for Bob"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"So anyway, he throws changing of the guards track too"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Probably because he's like, you know, a little bit"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Defiant, you know, he wants to"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"Show them that"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"That's a great song"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"You guys slept on Street Legal when it came out, you know what?"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"It's the greatest hit"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"That's right"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"He's basically saying, neither the critics"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Nor the public"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"Decide my greatest hits"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"I wish Robert Crisco would do sort of a"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"You know how Pitchfork does the like, Revisited?"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Oh yeah"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"If he would like, go back and be like, okay I just re-read my review"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"From 44 years ago"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Yeah"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"For Street Legal"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"And you know what?"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"A+"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"I take it all back"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"This is where it really starts to get interesting"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"On The Greatest Hits Volume 3, because I love this song"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"I was still waiting at the altar"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Which is from Shot of Love"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Which was his final Christian album"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"From the early 80's"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"This was a B-side to"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"One of the singles off that album"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Oh really?"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"Yeah, it was a B-side to Heart of Mine"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"It was on the album, but he's picking a B-side"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"To represent that whole album"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Oh yeah, but it's on the record"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Oh yeah, it's on the record, it's not just a B-side"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"But I'm just saying like, you know, there's a school of thought"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"That's like, well, you know, pick all the singles"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"Yeah"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"And this is him being like, if I'm gonna pick one song from Shot of Love"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"It's gonna be The Groom Still Waiting at the Altar"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"This is the exact type of thing"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"That song, I just like, could not have understood remotely"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"In my teens or 20's"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Oh, absolutely not"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Maybe even not my early 30's"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"But now"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"I mean"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"It's really not my favorite Bob mode"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Still"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"No, it's"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"I gotta say, I mean"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"The clunky blues"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"But this song gets better and better to me"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"Like, I know what you mean"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"He still dips heavily into this"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Oh yeah"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Bar rock vibe"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"West of the Jordan, east of the rock of Gibraltar"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"I see the curtain of the gate"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"And life's in my fate"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"I like, uh, you're at Columbia University"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Early 2000's, walking down to his dorm"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"And he's just playing this"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Shot of Love, dude"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"Classic record"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"Wait, so what do you love about this song?"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"I'm honestly, I usually like, will skip"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"This kind of stuff from Bob"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"I know the Bob heads out there"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Are just like rolling their eyes"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"Like, Jake's an amateur over here"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"But this is"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Okay, I really like the lyrics"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Because I think if you're gonna do like"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"Be like an aging white dude doing a straight ahead blues"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"You have to have a cool"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"You gotta bring it"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"Lyrical twist"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"And then I like the way that this song"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"Is like a slight twist on a blues"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"I see the curtain of the gate"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"And rising on the gate"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"See the moon's still waiting"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"At the altar"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Yeah, the turnaround is just like"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"It's one different way to turn around a blues progression"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"Which I kind of"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Oh, what I could say about Gloved Head"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Wouldn't come back to haunt me"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Honey, have you given up"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"Weirdly, this sounds like it's from the early 90's to me"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"I don't know, I'm not a fan of the 90's"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"I like the sort of Mr. Burns Bob Dylan"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Yeah"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"He gets on the phone and"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Rod's like ""Oh!"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Oh Bob! I can't believe it man"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"You know I respect you so much"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Oh I guess it was just a bit of confusion"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Oh I'm so sorry, I don't give a f***"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Give me the money"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Give me the money Rod!"""
01:40:46;01:40:48;"It sort of reminds me of a couple weeks ago"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"Oh I don't know when this is gonna air but"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"Did you guys see Kanye West's"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Induction, well not induction speech"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"But speech for Puff Daddy at the BET Awards"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"No I missed that"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"It's great"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"He shows up and he does this thing and he says"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"There's some really beautiful things about Puff"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"But one of the things he says is how important Puff was to him"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"And he goes you know I was"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Basically I made and produced music"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"Because of Bad Boy"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"And in my mind I was young but I was part of Bad Boy"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"I was signed to Bad Boy"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Before he even knew it"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"He goes that is not contractually binding"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"Because he knew"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Puff would go okay"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"It was so quick"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"It's so clever"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Puff puts his phone down, he's already texting the lawyer"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"That is not contractually binding"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Alright so Forever Young, classic"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Vibey, pretty song"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Covered many times"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"I don't think it was a single but"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Sort of the most enduring song"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Off that record"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"This is a top tier greatest hit"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Oh absolutely"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"This is the run that I really like"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"So we heard five songs"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Changing of the guards, still waiting at the altar"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Kind of strange but still three songs"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"That more or less make sense on greatest hit"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"And then you get into Joker Man"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Which of course"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"What more can we say about this"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"And also the fact that he like"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Ping pong between the 70s and 80s"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Makes it like a crazy listen"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"No I love that it's not in order"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Because that's another thing"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"A lot of times greatest hits records are in chronological order"
01:42:20;01:42:22;"Yes"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"This is not remotely"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Hell no"
01:42:26;01:42:32;"Mark Knopfler on guitar, Sly and Robbie"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Drums and bass"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"But yeah already just going forever"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"From Forever Young into Joker Man"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Bit of whiplash"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"And then I love this run"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"Then you get into this"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Which I didn't know"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Maybe I'd never heard until I was like really throwing on"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"Greatest hits volume 3 a lot"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Because this is where he's really getting weird"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"This song, Dignity"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Was unreleased"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"This is he's getting back up to his old tricks"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"Nobody had ever heard this song"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"Outside of maybe some weird people with bootlegs"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"So this is a song he'd worked on"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"During the Oh Mercy sessions"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"With Daniel Lanwau in the late 80s"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"And I guess he never quite nailed it or he didn't feel good about it"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"And then he kind of"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Retracked a few things and threw it on his"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Greatest hits volume 3 because why not"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"And maybe you know when I think about"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"Why the groom still waiting"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"At the altar is kind of like appealing to me"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"In this context"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"Even though you're totally right at almost any other"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"Age in my life I would hear the beginning"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"And I was just like next"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"Maybe it's because I like this idea of just Bob in '94"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Looking back and trying to pick the songs"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Of his that captured this era"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Maybe that's why I'm like fixated"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"On this lyrical thing that the groom"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Is still waiting at the altar the same way that"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"Joker Man also seems to be telling some"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Weird mystical tale of like"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"The moment and then this song"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Definitely feels like he might have had a"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"Feeling this clearly is not a greatest hit"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Of mine nobody knows it and yet"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"This has something to say about the way"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"I see the world right now"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"And this song is called Dignity so he felt this was"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Important enough to put on his greatest hits volume 3"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"This is a real"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"90s sound"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"This is a 90s"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Back to basics sound"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"Fat man looking at a blade of steel"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"Fat man looking at a"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"Blade of steel"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Thin man looking at his last meal"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"Hollow man looking at a"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"Cocktail"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"For dignity"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"Wise man looking"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"At a blade of grass"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"Young man looking"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"At a shadows that pass"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Poor man looking"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"To claim a claim"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"For dignity"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"Somebody"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Got murdered on New Years Eve"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Somebody"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Said dignity was the first to leave"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"I went"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"Into the city"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Went into the town"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Went into the land of the midnight sun"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Search and hide"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Search and look"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Searching everywhere"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"I know"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Asking the cops"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Where ever I go"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Have you"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Seen dignity"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"I love that line"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Asking the cops where ever I go"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Have you seen dignity"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Blind man breaking"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"Out of a trance"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"It's like a meditation on a concept"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Like you can picture Bob"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"In 89 just looking at like the modern world"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"And just being like"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"What happened to dignity man"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"We live in a political world"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Everything's broken and then he just starts writing like"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"Verse after verse with all these like weird"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Ways in to like what does dignity"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Mean somebody got murdered on New Years Eve"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"I heard dignity was the first to leave"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Like in a way"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"Remember we always used to joke about"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"The Eagles comeback song in the 90's called"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"Get over it and that was them being like"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Watching TV and just being like man"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"What's going on with this country everybody's whining"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Get over it"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Whereas I feel like this is Bob's way more mystical"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"Poetic version just like looking at"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"Modern America and empathetic"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"Yeah hitting it from all sides"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"You picture yeah"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Glenn Frey just like"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"At his Bel Air mansion you know"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And just like looking down"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"I mean I don't know if he really was but I just"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Like the tone of get over it is just like"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Get over it all this b****** and whining"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"And giving b****** get over it"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Kicking a fit wait listen to this"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"This is where he also just Bob like"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"All over the place I love this verse this is pretty"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Strange"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Drinking man listening to the boys ears"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"In a crowded room"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Full of covered up ears"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Looking into the lost"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Forgotten years"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"For dignity"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"Met Prince Philip"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"At the home of the blues"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"You catch that"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"Wow"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Prince Philip at the home of the blues"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"This is also really weird"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Especially looking back"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"Now after like having watched"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"The crown and this like"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Renewed focus on the royal family"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"I don't have in front of me but I think he's"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"I met Prince Philip at the home of the blues"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"He said he'd give me information"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"If his name wasn't used"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Blah blah blah"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"He said he'd been abused by dignity"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Wow"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Like did Bob he probably just made that up"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"But maybe Bob had some weird conversation"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"With Prince Philip well especially"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Did you ever watch the crown Jake?"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Yes although I'm not I didn't get up to the more modern era"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"Well like the first season of the crown"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"You know is so much about"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"The fact that"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Queen Elizabeth becomes queen and she's young"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Yeah and then she has her kind of like"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Bad boy"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Posh husband Prince Philip who's kind of like"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"So she has to deal with the fact that she's"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"Had this title imposed on her"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"And he has to deal with his kind of like"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Bruised male ego about being like"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Oh what now I'm just like the husband of the queen"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"I'm kind of like I'm like a jock"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"I'm like a royal jock"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Like and you know he's cheating on her"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"And being like a bad boy or something"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Obviously I don't really know what I'm talking about but I can say"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"Cause I was 10 years old in '94"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"And I wasn't familiar with like the"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"Discourse about the royal family but I feel like"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Especially with the Meghan and Harry era"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"I feel like in my life I've heard way more"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"People have and the crown way more people"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"Having conversations about the weird"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Duality of"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"The royal family especially since the"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Death of Diana which I think was in the"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Late 90s the idea that"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"The royal family on the"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"One hand is you know these people with all this"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"Power but they're also human beings"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"Imprisoned they're almost like"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"Imprisoned in a"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Symbolic world that they can't"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Really escape and they have to represent"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Something and they have to anyway"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"To me that's like conversations that I've"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Heard in my adult life so you know"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"The past 20 years there's something"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"About picturing Bob well I guess he wrote in '89"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Picturing Bob in '89 just thinking"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"About Prince Philip of all people"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"This is before all the drama with"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Diana just Bob thinking about Prince Philip"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"As he's meditating on the concept of dignity"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"And imagining a circumstance"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"Where Prince Philip was like a nervous"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Mob informant who wanted"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"To talk to him and said I'm gonna tell you something"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"But you can't use my name"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"And Bob's like what is it Prince Philip?"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"I've been abused"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"By dignity. It weirdly"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"Like tracks with this like modern royal family"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"It's just the fact that even on Bob's mind"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"This idea of a member of the royal family"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"Feeling like he's"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Flipping the concept of dignity now as"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Being like an imposing oppressive force"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"And for some reason he's thinking about Prince"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Philip and he's thinking like"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Prince Philip has to maintain a sense"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Of decorum and dignity"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"That's the job. Which in his case literally"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Means being like a professional boyfriend"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"Professional quiet boyfriend"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Yeah and maybe not pursuing"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"What's really in your heart"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Right. You have to"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Maintain the pose. And just the"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Fact that yeah that Bob's like truly hitting"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"Dignity from every side"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"I met Jeffrey Epstein"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"The other day"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"Bob"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"I asked him where his money's from he said he didn't know"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"What did you know Bob?"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Whoa okay hold on. Breaking news"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Breaking news"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"That looks like about 30 years old"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"So Seinfeld what did you just find out?"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"So there's an article describing"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"A 1996 event"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Where Bob Dylan"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Meets Prince Charles and is"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Seated next to him"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"This is part of a"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"So the Prince of Wales has a youth oriented"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Charity founded in 76"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"To help vulnerable young people get their lives"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"On track. There was an event"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"Where it was Dylan"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Roger Daltrey, Pete Townsend"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"Ronnie Wood for a concert"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"In Royal Park"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"All British people. Mostly Englishmen"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Except for Bob. Quote ""Sometime during the day"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Dylan had the opportunity to meet the Prince"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Backstage. An unsmiling"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Shade wearing Dylan along with Rolling Stones guitarist"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"Ronnie Wood greeted the Prince"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Also in a star studded photo op"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Dylan was sat directly next to Prince"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Charles. The pair can even be seen"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Exchanging a few words in the video"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Below although the exact transcript"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"Is unclear. A mysterious moment"
01:51:16;01:51:18;"We'll never know what words were spoken between them"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"Mr. Dylan"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"I quite enjoyed"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"Dignity"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"Of your greatest hits volume 3"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"The line about my"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Father is quite humorous"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"Quite perceptive there Mr."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"Bob. I also feel like same with"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"Robert Hunter and the dead I always"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Can't help but clock moments when"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"These lyricists and songwriters"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Who are so all American"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"And so like their whole world is like"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"In the American"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"Mythical place"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Anytime they like step out"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Just like talk about the British Royal Family"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"The same way as I've said many times on the show"
01:51:54;01:51:56;"I think. The only"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"Grateful Dead song that takes place in England"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"Is Scarlet Begonias"
01:52:00;01:52:04;"Anyway, Dignity"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"Great song. And again"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"Like I can't fully explain it but somehow"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"The logic of putting Dignity on his greatest hits"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Volume 3 makes sense. I really feel"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"Like there's something about this where I'm getting"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"A sense of like Bob Dylan's"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Worldview in 94. He wanted"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"You to hear Changing of the Guard. He wanted"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"You to hear Groom Still Waiting at the Altar. He wanted"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"You to hear Dignity and Joker Man. Like somehow"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"That was reflecting his"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"Where he was at"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"The song after Dignity"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"I guess he's played this live a lot but again"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"I feel like most people outside of real"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"Dylan heads don't know this. What's your familiarity"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"With this one Jake Silvio? I don't have"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"A lot of familiarity with this one"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"This was new to me when I"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"Listened to Greatest Hits Volume 3"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"The other day. When you threw on V3?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"It was new to me. So this is Silvio"
01:52:48;01:52:58;"So this is off"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Down in the groove"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Which came out in '88"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Another pretty poorly received album"
01:53:04;01:53:22;"Love that mandolin"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Yeah and the sound of this. Well Jake you might"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Have already looked this up. I don't know but it came out"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"In '88. Can you think of any records"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"From roughly in this time period that this"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Sounds like?"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"In the Dark? Yes"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Yes because doesn't this sound"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"So much like an In the Dark? Yeah"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"Or even a Built to Last type song"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"Because it's like"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"I feel like this is when like the. Maybe more Built to Last"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"Which are the"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Last two Grateful Dead albums"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"For anybody who's been living under a rock"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"But like"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Because I feel like this era like Built to Last"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"And stuff. The late 80s were when some"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"Of the 60s guys"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"Well the Dead had sat out most of the 80s"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"But when some of the late 60s guys had finally figured out"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"How to like tastefully use"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"Some light 80s production techniques"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"But keep it kind of light and bouncy"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Yeah a little like Steve Winwood"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Vibes too. Yeah it's like"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"Back in the high life kind of vibe. Yeah totally"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"Where it's like the best mix of"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"80s recording techniques with"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Rootsy Bon"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"Or even I mean honestly. The show. Even"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Oh Bruce Hornsby. Oh yeah"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"But he was a younger dude so he had that"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"He had more insight. That's true"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"In some of the old heads. But I would"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"Even say like Graceland has a touch"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Of that. Like just because he has like"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"The Zydeco song on it where"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"But one cool thing about Silvio. So not only"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"Does it remind reminiscent of"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"The last two Grateful Dead records. This song"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Was co-written by Robert Hunter. Oh wow"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"And on backup"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Vocals on this song. Jerry"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Bob and Brent"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Well they were about to go tour"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"Yeah so they were about to do the Dylan"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"The Dead tour. So this is almost like"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"The smallest little taste we could get"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"Of if they had made a studio album"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Together. Dylan and the Dead. It might have sounded"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"Like this. His voice sounds so strong here though"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"Where I feel like I don't know"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Maybe it's the recording of it"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"But that Dylan and the Dead"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Just he sounds so bad. I mean"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"His voice doesn't sound nearly as"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"Strong and this is way within the ear"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Yeah maybe. Well it's live and"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"I wish Jerry was playing guitar on this"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh that'd be"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Oh yeah."
01:55:24;01:55:34;"Jerry would have torn"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"It up on this. I mean we need it"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Also the name Silvio just makes me think"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"Of The Sopranos"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"This one could have been"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"On Desire. Kind of. The song"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"Writing. Oh yeah yeah right. Yeah with the"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"70s production. Totally. Silvio"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"Silver and gold"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Yeah I've never heard this"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"One Down on the Groove. It's one"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"That's oft referenced on the Jokerman pod"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"Do they like it? Oh yeah"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"I mean the whole Jokerman"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Mindset is just like"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"We've all heard the 60s stuff a million times. We're not gonna talk"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"About that. Right. Let's go deep on"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Knocked Out, Loaded and Down on the"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"Groove. Down on the Groove"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"But I've"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"This is one of those albums I still have never cracked"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"Maybe Silvio's your way in"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"I also do kind of love. I think it is"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"One. I think it's pretty cool"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"A cool element of Bob too"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"Is that like he's one of the best songwriters"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"And lyricists of all time"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"But he would just like write with other people"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Every now and then and"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"You know famously on Desire"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"He wrote with that guy Jacques Levy"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"And they wrote these like epic stories together"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Later we'll hear Brownsville Girl which he"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Co-wrote with the playwright and actor Sam Shepard"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"Oh I didn't realize that. Yeah. Okay"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"I didn't. And then. But then Silvio it's cool"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"It's like Bob. For Bob Dylan"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"And Robert Hunter to link up"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"That's for a certain type"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"Of fan that's like Watch the Throne"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"Yeah no that's too heavy"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"That's"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Coming together. And then they wrote together"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Alley and Foreman. Yeah"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"And then"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"They did it again like in"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"The 2000s on a much"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"Later album. A Bob record or"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"Yeah yeah it's the one with"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Duquesne Whistle"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Yeah yeah that's Tempest. Oh yeah"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"They linked up again on Tempest"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"So the two Bob and Robert"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Together"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"So we're realizing"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"That it's gonna take a bit"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Longer to get through all of Bob Dylan's greatest"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"It's Fine 3 so we're gonna spill a little bit of it"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"Into the next episode. Don't worry we'll talk about"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Other stuff too. It won't be all Bob"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"Well. Well"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Famous last words"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"We'll make sure there's some flights of fancy but"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"I do think for the TC head"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"Especially the people getting a little"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"Burned out on the corporate food history"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"This is exactly what the doctor"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"Ordered. I know for a fact that"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"At least I'm thinking at least 25"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"To 60% of TC heads"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"Are casual Bob Dylan fans"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Who need a way into the later stuff"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"Nobody's ever said that"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Nobody's ever asked for it and yet"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"I have that feeling. Where to begin"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"Well we got you folks. We got you folks"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"Two part TC extravaganza"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"This is what Time Crisis is all about. Bob Dylan"
01:58:08;01:58:10;"Volume 3. Greatest Hits"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"Two parter. Volume 3"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"Anyway so we'll play one more song on this"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Episode but you know"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"Join us in two weeks"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"To talk more"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"BDGHV3"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"That's Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3"
01:58:24;01:58:26;"My favorite Bob Dylan album"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"*laughs*"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Just imagine that"
01:58:30;01:58:32;"Story like in some country that never had Bob Dylan"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"Records and this is just like the first album anybody"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Heard and it's like man I always liked that album"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"That he made. Greatest"
01:58:38;01:58:40;"It's all over the place but it's a cool record"
01:58:40;01:58:42;"Anyway so this is like a pretty classic"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"Just like pretty Bob Dylan song. It almost reminds me"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"Of like Randy Newman or something"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"Do you know this one Jake? Oh yeah"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"So this one you're totally familiar with"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"Yeah I know Oh Mercy pretty well. You're an Oh Mercy head? Yeah"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"So he threw this one on Ring Them Bells"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Yeah this is a really pretty one"
01:58:56;01:59:04;"Yeah that side B of Oh Mercy is"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Mmm"
01:59:06;01:59:12;"That's a real nice frame"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"Yeah so Randy Newman's playing"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"Yeah I can hear that"
01:59:16;01:59:30;"So is the bride"
01:59:30;01:59:32;"Bride and groom man"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"I think you're right on your theory"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"On how he put this together"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"Like there's a lot of lyrical"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"Themes that weave in and out"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"Right. Cause he could have put on like Most of the"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"Time or Political World"
01:59:44;01:59:46;"Yes. On this record"
01:59:46;01:59:48;"This is a bit of a deeper"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"Real album cut"
01:59:50;01:59:52;"Yeah"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"Sun's going down upon the sacred cow"
02:00:02;02:00:08;"That Daniel Lanois"
02:00:08;02:00:10;"Atmosphere"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"For the poor man's son"
02:00:12;02:00:16;"Ring them bells"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"So the world will know that"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"God is one"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"For the shepherds asleep"
02:00:22;02:00:26;"Where the willows weep"
02:00:26;02:00:28;"And the mountains"
02:00:28;02:00:30;"Are filled with"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"Lost sheep"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"Ring them bells"
02:00:34;02:00:36;"For the blind"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"And the deaf"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"Ring them bells"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"For all of us"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"Who are led"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"Ring them bells"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"For the chosen"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"Few"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"Who will judge the many"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"When the game"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"Is through"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"Ring them bells"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"For the time"
02:01:00;02:01:02;"That flies"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"For the child that cries"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"When"
02:01:06;02:01:08;"Innocence dies"
02:01:08;02:01:12;"Ring them bells"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"St. Catherine"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"What's up with St. Catherine?"
02:01:16;02:01:18;"What's he talking about St. Catherine?"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"From the fortress"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"For the lilies that bloom"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"Catherine of Siena"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"St. Catherine, a lay member of the"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"Dominican Order, was a mystic, activist"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"And author who had great influence"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"On the Italian literature and Catholic Church"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"I think Bob's a real history head"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"Oh yeah, totally"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"Early Roman Kings"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"That's a song I definitely heard about"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"From Jokerman Pod"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"What album is that on?"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"You caught me on the spot here, I'm not sure"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"It's the same one with Duquesne Whistle"
02:01:48;02:01:50;"Oh, Tempest"
02:01:50;02:01:52;"Have you listened to Tempest, the song?"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"No, I made like a mental note after listening to"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"Jokerman, I was like, I'm gonna go deep on Tempest"
02:01:56;02:01:58;"Maybe after we, next episode, when we finish"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume 3"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"We dive into Tempest"
02:02:02;02:02:04;"And hopefully this time crisis will just become"
02:02:04;02:02:06;"Jokerman"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"We're just gonna steal their thunder, I mean, they've moved on"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"Yeah, they've moved on to Velvet Underground, so we'll just start doing"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"Um"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"And you know, we'll pay, with all due respect"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"We'll say like, you know, when we list"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"The materials that the"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"Avid listener needs to understand"
02:02:20;02:02:22;"The episode, we'll say, you know"
02:02:22;02:02:24;"Listen to the Bob Dylan album Tempest"
02:02:24;02:02:26;"Check out these five Jokerman pods"
02:02:26;02:02:28;"Read these books"
02:02:28;02:02:30;"We recommend all of that as you listen to the"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"episode. Well, let's go out on Early Roman"
02:02:32;02:02:34;"Kings, cause this is like some Bob"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"Blues"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"That's right"
02:02:38;02:02:44;"Alright, we'll be back to finish"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"Greatest Hits, Volume 3"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"Remember, this song is not on Greatest Hits, Volume 3"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"But Bob is a history buff"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"And maybe you didn't know that he wrote"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"A song called Early Roman Kings"
02:02:54;02:02:56;"In the 2000s. Now you do"
02:02:56;02:02:58;"Alright, talk soon. Peace"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"Dive in the specs"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"And"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"Blaze in the rails"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"Nail in the coffins"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"In"
02:03:08;02:03:10;"Time passing tails"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"Fly away little bird"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"Fly away"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"Flap your wings"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"Fly by night"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"Like the"
02:03:20;02:03:22;"Early Roman Kings"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"Time Crisis"
02:03:24;02:03:26;"With Ezra Koenig"
02:03:26;02:03:28;"NIGGER!"
