00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:14;"On today's TC, we'll talk about Larry Norman, Jesus Christ, and Hubba Stank, among many others."
00:14;00:19;"This is a very special TC."
00:19;00:25;"So grab a beverage, kick up your feet, and relax."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The war I fell to obey me, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Even only they"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:21;"We've been banking the Eps."
01:21;01:23;"Just a little bit, not severely banked."
01:23;01:25;"Light banking."
01:25;01:27;"Light banking, just a little bit ahead of schedule."
01:27;01:29;"Just trying to get on more of a summer schedule."
01:29;01:31;"How you doing, Jake?"
01:31;01:33;"Doing great."
01:33;01:35;"We're all here together in person in the studio."
01:35;01:36;"Got Seinfeld."
01:36;01:37;"Hey, what's up?"
01:37;01:38;"Got Nick."
01:38;01:39;"Hello."
01:39;01:40;"Good to be back."
01:40;01:42;"Gotta say, in person feels great."
01:42;01:43;"Totally different energy."
01:43;01:44;"Been missing it."
01:44;01:45;"Yep."
01:45;01:47;"It flows different."
01:47;01:49;"Yeah, we got them in the future, we gotta mix it up."
01:49;01:50;"We gotta get a little bit of both."
01:50;01:51;"Yep."
01:51;01:53;"But with our busy schedules, it's not always easy."
01:53;01:55;"Getting cross town to Culver at rush hour."
01:55;01:56;"[laughs]"
01:56;01:57;"Hardcore."
01:57;01:58;"Gotta structure your day around that."
01:58;01:59;"[laughs]"
01:59;02:01;"Hardcore."
02:01;02:03;"We gotta maybe just build a TC clubhouse."
02:03;02:05;"TC East. Eastside."
02:05;02:10;"Maybe we can link up with Yardhouse and see if they can give us a designated booth."
02:10;02:12;"Kind of a win-win."
02:12;02:13;"[laughs]"
02:13;02:15;"Soundproofed booth."
02:15;02:17;"[laughs]"
02:17;02:19;"It's just really loud."
02:19;02:21;"I mean, we've recorded Time Crisis in restaurants before."
02:21;02:22;"That's true."
02:22;02:26;"We did the Tom's Diner, also known as the Seinfeld Diner."
02:26;02:30;"We did a diner in Iowa City. Or not Iowa City, maybe Ames, Iowa."
02:30;02:31;"Oh yeah."
02:31;02:32;"That's crazy."
02:32;02:36;"Yeah, we used to just be doing on the ground reporting."
02:36;02:42;"In some ways, that's the least TC [beep] we ever did, was being on the ground at the presidential primaries."
02:42;02:44;"What were we doing?"
02:44;02:45;"[laughs]"
02:45;02:46;"I can't remember."
02:46;02:47;"That was too ambitious."
02:47;02:48;"That was too ambitious for us."
02:48;02:51;"Yeah, we really hit our stride when we stopped trying so hard."
02:51;02:56;"Seinfeld, you said we got an interesting email recently about baked potatoes."
02:56;03:01;"I'm sorry to say we kind of dropped the hot potato in the last ep."
03:01;03:04;"I think there were very few baked potato references."
03:04;03:07;"But this is the Time Crisis year of the baked potato."
03:07;03:09;"So let's keep it going."
03:09;03:12;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
03:12;03:14;"Yeah, this is incredible."
03:14;03:17;"This is an email from Brittany S. in St. Petersburg, Florida."
03:17;03:20;"She writes, ""Long time listener. First time emailer."
03:20;03:23;"I love the show TC Head for Life. Nice."
03:23;03:28;"Had to write in to tell y'all about the '90s themed baked potato restaurant in my town."
03:28;03:31;"It's a restaurant called Half Baked."""
03:31;03:32;"[laughs]"
03:32;03:34;"It's the Half Baked Potato. Hang on."
03:34;03:35;"Oh."
03:35;03:39;"It's the Half Baked Potato in St. Petersburg."
03:39;03:41;"The menu is very interesting. They have a lot of--"
03:41;03:46;"I just got to say, interesting play on words, because when it's just called Half Baked,"
03:46;03:51;"it makes you think of the famous stoner comedy with Dave Chappelle and Jim Brewer."
03:51;03:54;"But when you hear the whole phrase, ""the half baked potato,"""
03:54;03:58;"suddenly I stop thinking-- I don't think about the movie Half Baked."
03:58;04:04;"I'm just picturing kind of like a hard, not fully cooked potato."
04:04;04:07;"It does sound like an undercooked baked potato a little bit."
04:07;04:12;"They are apparently 420 friendly on their site."
04:12;04:14;"Okay. What does that mean for a restaurant in Florida?"
04:14;04:15;"They don't freak you out if you're high?"
04:15;04:16;"420 vibes."
04:16;04:21;"It's like a stoner-- it's a psychedelic take on the baked potato."
04:21;04:24;"Okay. All right. That's that. I guess they can't help-- you can't--"
04:24;04:26;"weed's not legal in Florida, is it?"
04:26;04:27;"No."
04:27;04:28;"It will be soon, I'm sure."
04:28;04:30;"All right. They can't help it. They're in Florida."
04:30;04:32;"They're only so 420 friendly."
04:32;04:35;"Yeah. There can't be no laws here."
04:35;04:41;"The Half Baked Potato has successfully lobbied Governor Ron DeSantis to grant them--"
04:41;04:43;"[laughs]"
04:43;04:50;"a type of sovereignty akin to a Native American reservation"
04:50;04:53;"or maybe the Vatican City in Italy,"
04:53;04:57;"which allows them to be truly 420 friendly."
04:57;05:00;"But as soon as you step outside of the Half Baked Potato's doors,"
05:00;05:05;"you will be immediately arrested by the authorities."
05:05;05:07;"They do have their own police force."
05:07;05:09;"It's like Vatican City."
05:09;05:13;"Their bio is delicious loaded potatoes with a mix of '80s and '90s throwback,"
05:13;05:16;"New Orleans flavor, and 420 vibes."
05:16;05:18;"Wait, I don't get the '80s and '90s."
05:18;05:20;"The baked potato is timeless."
05:20;05:23;"Well, we did talk about how this all started with us saying"
05:23;05:26;"that the baked potato feels a little bit like a relic."
05:26;05:28;"It was in the 20th century."
05:28;05:32;"Okay. So what are the '90s toppings that you could get on a baked potato?"
05:32;05:33;"Okay. So--"
05:33;05:37;"Only '90s kids will remember these baked potato toppings."
05:37;05:39;"Oh, wow. I mean, let me tell you."
05:39;05:42;"So they've got about on their menu--"
05:42;05:46;"I mean, I want to say 27 or so different signature potatoes."
05:46;05:47;"That's too many."
05:47;05:49;"You know there's that show Bar Rescue"
05:49;05:53;"where the guy goes to bars and helps them kind of tighten things up?"
05:53;05:55;"We should do a baked potato rescue show."
05:55;05:59;"We go to baked potato restaurants, kind of open the books,"
05:59;06:04;"look at the menu, and maybe kind of help them get things a little more ship shape."
06:04;06:09;"I mean, these titles, these names of these dishes are very clever."
06:09;06:11;"They've got Be My Super Hero."
06:11;06:14;"There's a hero meat, Suzuki."
06:14;06:17;"There's It's Brisket B***, which is like--"
06:17;06:18;"[laughter]"
06:18;06:20;"Which is like It's Brittany B***."
06:20;06:21;"Okay."
06:21;06:24;"All right. This place rules. They actually don't need our help."
06:24;06:27;"Pasta La Vista Baby, that's their pasta baked potato."
06:27;06:29;"Pasta baked potato?"
06:29;06:31;"So there's pasta in the baked potato?"
06:31;06:36;"So it's topped with spaghetti bolognese, smoked sausage mozzarella,"
06:36;06:38;"and they've described it as comfort food is its finest."
06:38;06:42;"That one's for Jake. Jake loves a sausage topping on pizza."
06:42;06:43;"That's true."
06:43;06:46;"I mean, the truth is the spaghetti potato combo is interesting."
06:46;06:49;"But there's no actual spaghetti. It's just the bolognese sauce?"
06:49;06:54;"It says spaghetti bolognese, so I think there's spaghetti in it."
06:54;06:57;"It's called Pasta La Vista."
06:57;06:59;"Because, okay, that's strange."
06:59;07:03;"Because you're thinking a baked potato with a bolognese sauce would be nice."
07:03;07:04;"It'd be great. Absolutely."
07:04;07:05;"I'd be down."
07:05;07:09;"You know what I like? The last item on the first page of this menu is called The F*** It."
07:09;07:11;"The description is--"
07:11;07:13;"The F*** It?"
07:13;07:15;"Yeah, the F*** It. And it's not really a meal."
07:15;07:17;"It says, ""Not sure what you want? Let us choose for you."
07:17;07:20;"We'll ask you some questions at the register,"" with a smiling emoji."
07:20;07:21;"Oh, they're vibing."
07:21;07:24;"They interrogate you a little bit, and they help you find--"
07:24;07:26;"they help you locate the potato that's--"
07:26;07:28;"Okay, I like that, because that is pretty old school,"
07:28;07:29;"but I feel like the modern--"
07:29;07:31;"especially with apps and stuff,"
07:31;07:34;"and there's this increasingly antisocial behavior"
07:34;07:36;"and generations raised on the internet,"
07:36;07:39;"or at the very least an extreme type of shyness,"
07:39;07:41;"and you picture at so many restaurants,"
07:41;07:43;"and even Starbucks and stuff, people order online,"
07:43;07:47;"just run in, just grab it, like zero interaction."
07:47;07:49;"And then even a lot of places where they look at the menu,"
07:49;07:50;"and you just order it."
07:50;07:54;"The idea of actually coming in"
07:54;07:57;"and having a heart-to-heart with the person behind the counter"
07:57;07:59;"saying, ""Listen, I'm a little bit confused today."
07:59;08:01;"I want the f*** it."""
08:01;08:03;"""Oh, okay, you want the f*** it."
08:03;08:05;"All right, well, let me ask you a few questions."""
08:05;08:06;"""What kind of mood you in?"""
08:06;08:08;"[laughter]"
08:08;08:11;"""Well, I've had a real crappy day."""
08:11;08:13;"""Okay, so you're probably going to want something"
08:13;08:14;"a little bit sweet."
08:14;08:15;"You're going to want some comfort food,"
08:15;08:19;"maybe over a kind of diet baked potato?"""
08:19;08:21;"""Yeah, I just need something to improve my mood."
08:21;08:23;"I'm not calorie counting today."""
08:23;08:24;"""I want to indulge."""
08:24;08:26;"[laughter]"
08:26;08:29;"""I like the idea that you've gone to a hyper-specific..."""
08:29;08:30;"""It's free therapy."""
08:30;08:31;"""Yeah, exactly."""
08:31;08:33;"""It starts getting a little deeper."""
08:33;08:35;"""Hey, a life hack for people in Florida."
08:35;08:37;"Don't waste your money on therapy."
08:37;08:40;"Go down to the half-baked potato and get the f*** it."
08:40;08:42;"It's actually twice as effective."""
08:43;08:45;"Early in the morning,"
08:45;08:47;"rising to the street."
08:47;08:50;"Light me up that cigarette,"
08:50;08:52;"and I'll strap shoes on my feet."
08:52;08:55;"Try to find the reason,"
08:55;08:57;"the reason things went wrong."
08:57;09:02;"Got to find the reason why my money's on the bone."
09:02;09:07;"I got a Dalmatian that I could stick in her."
09:07;09:12;"I can play the guitar like a motherf***ing riot."
09:13;09:15;"The letter continues."
09:15;09:17;"""They have a lot of different baked potato creations."
09:17;09:19;"They also serve ramen randomly."""
09:19;09:20;"That's true."
09:20;09:21;"There's a little ramen section."
09:21;09:22;"""Wait, in the baked potato,"
09:22;09:24;"or that's just a different part of the menu?"""
09:24;09:26;"You can just get ramen."
09:26;09:28;"""Yeah, so they also,"
09:28;09:30;"they have a handful of other items."
09:30;09:33;"There's a ramen, pierogies, and hot dogs are also,"
09:33;09:35;"but it's like sort of a sub."
09:35;09:37;"It's like, that's not the main event, obviously."""
09:37;09:39;"Ramen, pierogies, hot dogs."
09:39;09:40;"They got a salad bar there?"
09:40;09:42;"""I'm not seeing any salad bar."
09:42;09:44;"Oh, they got a sushi roll."""
09:44;09:45;"Sushi?"
09:45;09:46;"""They've got a..."""
09:46;09:47;"Okay, this is just..."
09:47;09:48;"""Oh, they've got the Elvis,"
09:48;09:51;"which is peanut butter, bacon bits, and marshmallows."""
09:51;09:53;"Wait, wait, are we back to baked potatoes now?"
09:53;09:55;"""No, no, no, we're down in the hot dog section."""
09:55;09:57;"Oh, God."
09:57;09:58;"""There's a lot happening here."""
09:58;10:00;"Wait, what town is this in?"
10:00;10:02;"""It's in St. Petersburg, and it's 420 friendly."""
10:02;10:04;"Okay, I feel like that answers"
10:04;10:06;"a lot of the reasoning behind this."
10:06;10:07;"""Like, you walk in..."""
10:07;10:08;"Stoned as hell."
10:08;10:09;"""F*** it."""
10:09;10:10;"Blasted."
10:10;10:12;"""You're stoned out of your gourd."
10:12;10:14;"You walk in, and you go, 'F*** it,'"
10:14;10:15;"and they tell you what to eat."
10:15;10:17;"She writes, ""Please check out the quote,"
10:17;10:18;"'Pulled Pork Parfait,'"
10:18;10:21;"a take on the '90s snack, Dirt Cups,"

10:26;10:27;"Oh, sorry, go on, go on."
10:27;10:28;"""Well, I don't..."
10:28;10:29;"That's a good..."
10:29;10:30;"What is a Dirt Cup?"""
10:30;10:31;"I mean, when I say Dirt Cups,"
10:31;10:33;"I have vague memories of being in, like,"
10:33;10:35;"grade school,"
10:35;10:37;"and there's a thing that it was, like,"
10:37;10:40;"a fake cup of dirt with, like,"
10:40;10:42;"gummy worms in it,"
10:42;10:43;"and the dirt was made out of, like,"
10:43;10:45;"crumbly chocolate."
10:45;10:46;"""Is that a '90s thing? I don't..."""
10:46;10:49;"I mean, that does have '90s kid energy."
10:49;10:51;"""Guys, I gotta show you a photo"
10:51;10:54;"of the pasta la vista."""
10:54;10:55;"[laughing]"
10:55;10:56;"Oh, what?"
10:56;10:57;"""So it's..."
10:57;11:00;"I mean, it's a ton of angel hair pasta"
11:00;11:01;"with a bolognese,"
11:01;11:03;"and it looks like they've just thrown,"
11:03;11:05;"like, sort of shaved mozzarella,"
11:05;11:06;"like, from a bag."""
11:06;11:08;"I mean, I can barely see the potato under there."
11:08;11:11;"It looks like a plate of pasta from over here."
11:11;11:12;"I mean, here's what's tough"
11:12;11:14;"about these kind of restaurants is"
11:14;11:15;"that could be great,"
11:15;11:19;"but you have to make every element perfect."
11:19;11:20;"I'm gonna assume they know how to do"
11:20;11:21;"a really nice baked potato,"
11:21;11:23;"'cause that's their base here."
11:23;11:24;"But if you're gonna..."
11:24;11:26;"So you're just gonna have one ran--"
11:26;11:28;"a few random stoners,"
11:28;11:29;"just a few Florida deadheads"
11:29;11:31;"working behind the counter."
11:31;11:33;"Well, you're gonna need one person"
11:33;11:34;"who knows how to cook"
11:34;11:37;"perfectly al dente angel hair pasta."
11:37;11:38;"You're gonna need somebody else"
11:38;11:41;"who knows how to do Korean barbecue."
11:41;11:43;"You're gonna need a whole Iron Chef team"
11:43;11:45;"to really make this place work."
11:45;11:46;"They're just boiling some pasta"
11:46;11:48;"and dumping some ragu on there."
11:48;11:51;"All right, that doesn't sound good."
11:51;11:52;"You're gonna need somebody who really--"
11:52;11:54;"they have to have high-quality mozzarella"
11:54;11:55;"who really knows how to--"
11:55;11:57;"They need a sushi chef."
11:57;11:59;"Yes."
11:59;12:00;"Yeah."
12:00;12:02;"They need Jiro."
12:02;12:03;"They got Jiro back there."
12:03;12:08;"No, I like the Euros and sushi under the same roof."
12:08;12:10;"[laughter]"
12:10;12:12;"But I always think about these places"
12:12;12:14;"where they have--"
12:14;12:16;"I mean, it's a little bit like a diner"
12:16;12:18;"where there's, like, an endless menu."
12:18;12:19;"Yeah."
12:19;12:21;"And you know that 80% to 90%"
12:21;12:23;"of what they're cooking day in, day out"
12:23;12:26;"is maybe, like, 10 items."
12:26;12:28;"So you know that, you know,"
12:28;12:30;"when you roll in one of these days"
12:30;12:31;"and you're asking, you know,"
12:31;12:35;"for the Mongolian barbecue baked potato,"
12:35;12:36;"there's definitely somebody there"
12:36;12:38;"who's like, ""Oh, right."
12:38;12:40;"Yeah, [bleep] I haven't made this in three weeks."
12:40;12:42;"How do we do this one?"""
12:42;12:43;"You know what I mean?"
12:43;12:44;"It's not gonna be dialed in."
12:44;12:46;"It's very hard to nail all those things."
12:46;12:49;"That Dirt Cup pulled pork parfait,"
12:49;12:52;"it has flaming hot Cheetos and gummy worms on top."
12:52;12:54;"With pulled pork?"
12:54;12:56;"Yeah, I have to assume that's the base."
12:56;12:57;"Oh, why?"
12:57;12:58;"That's the dirt."
12:58;12:59;"Over the line."
12:59;13:01;"I mean, it's 420 friendly."
13:01;13:03;"They play '90s music and have"

13:17;13:18;"He seems like an interesting guy."
13:18;13:20;"Okay, maybe next time."
13:20;13:23;"I mean, I'm definitely interested in this place."
13:23;13:24;"I mean, this is what it..."
13:24;13:28;"I'm looking at all these photos of the dishes."
13:28;13:32;"It's basically the baked potato is..."
13:32;13:34;"It's basically the plate."
13:34;13:35;"Do you know what I mean?"
13:35;13:37;"It's like they're putting a whole meal"
13:37;13:39;"on top of the baked potato."
13:39;13:40;"Is the portion so large?"
13:40;13:41;"No, the portion's like..."
13:41;13:44;"Look, this one of Swedish meatballs"
13:44;13:49;"has two, four, six, eight, nine Swedish meatballs"
13:49;13:51;"on the baked potato."
13:51;13:52;"And I just have to show you,"
13:52;13:54;"this is the Elvis hot dog."
13:54;13:55;"Whoa!"
13:55;13:57;"Oh my God."
13:57;13:59;"Heads up."
13:59;14:01;"I mean, so what it does look like is that..."
14:01;14:03;"It's a hot dog with marshmallows."
14:03;14:06;"It looks like they threw a bunch of mini marshmallows"
14:06;14:09;"that you'd sort of put in like a hot cocoa."
14:09;14:12;"But it does look like they've taken a blowtorch"
14:12;14:13;"to the top of it,"
14:13;14:16;"the way you might in maybe a fancy restaurant or something,"
14:16;14:18;"where it's just like they've sort of toasted."
14:18;14:19;"Yeah, you kind of torch it."
14:19;14:20;"Caramelize it."
14:20;14:21;"They caramelize it."
14:21;14:24;"I mean, there's peanut butter on that hot dog?"
14:24;14:25;"Oh, yeah."
14:25;14:26;"That could almost be good."
14:26;14:28;"This, it's this substance."
14:28;14:30;"It's sort of this viscous substance."
14:30;14:31;"This viscous."

15:18;15:23;"Okay, now I understand why you keep telling us it's 420 friendly."
15:23;15:28;"Is that these are like kind of monstrous stoner creations"
15:28;15:31;"that you probably need to be high to eat."
15:31;15:35;"And there is something about when you're super blazed"
15:35;15:38;"that what you're looking for in food changes a bit."
15:38;15:42;"You do want an interesting mix of textures and flavors."
15:42;15:43;"And large quantities."
15:44;15:47;"Okay, so now I understand where they're coming from a bit."
15:47;15:51;"And I'm noticing that the menu has a subtle but large marijuana leaf"
15:51;15:53;"sort of like beneath everything."
15:53;15:56;"So this is like they're really true to the concept."
15:56;16:00;"My read is that the food is secondary to the concept."
16:00;16:03;"The baked potato is secondary to the toppings."
16:03;16:06;"You really got to dig, dig deep to get to the potato"
16:06;16:09;"at the core of this whole concept."
16:09;16:11;"So most people who dine there are just leaving"
16:11;16:17;"a kind of dirty baked potato on their plate."
16:17;16:21;"Well, that's why it's half baked because no one actually eats the potato."
16:21;16:22;"That's right."
16:22;16:24;"Because they don't actually have to cook it."
16:24;16:26;"Well, I would love to talk to the owner."
16:26;16:28;"I appreciate the creativity."
16:28;16:29;"I'm just curious how it's doing."
16:29;16:31;"What's the price point on this stuff?"
16:31;16:32;"Oh, great question."
16:32;16:34;"What's that pasta la vista going to run you?"
16:34;16:37;"All right, that pasta la vista is $14."
16:37;16:38;"Solid."
16:38;16:43;"It looks like pasta la vista is enough food for a two-person family."
16:43;16:44;"How are they doing?"
16:44;16:45;"I don't know."
16:45;16:46;"When do they open?"
16:46;16:47;"Let's see."
16:47;16:48;"Are there some Yelp reviews?"
16:48;16:49;"Let's find out."
16:49;16:52;"I also just feel like it does have the feeling of being"
16:52;16:56;"one or two many things going on on the mood board."
16:56;17:01;"For instance, if you were like, ""This is like an 80s and 90s themed restaurant."
17:01;17:10;"They play cartoons from the 80s and 90s, and you can get junky breakfast cereal."""
17:10;17:13;"Because sometimes you see these places that look kind of nasty."
17:13;17:17;"It's like, ""The cereal bar,"" and it's a kind of touristy, goofy place"
17:17;17:19;"you can go eat Captain Crunch or something."
17:19;17:22;"If you went there and they were--"
17:22;17:26;"You could understand how that'd be some kind of nostalgia throwback, goofy thing"
17:26;17:32;"for aging millennials to go eat some junky cereal and watch cartoons."
17:32;17:34;"If you said, ""420 friendly,"" sure."
17:34;17:37;"Roll up late night, eat Froot Loops, and watch--"
17:37;17:40;"But this restaurant is like, ""You got to be blazed."
17:40;17:43;"You got to be absolutely wrecked."""
17:43;17:45;"It does feel like there's a dark--"
17:45;17:48;"There's almost a dark energy walking into this place,"
17:48;17:50;"and it's just full of zombies."
17:50;17:53;"We open at 10 p.m."
17:53;17:57;"So high they can't talk to each other, and they're all just digging in."
17:57;17:59;"They're all like, ""Do these--"""
17:59;18:02;"This place is like--"
18:02;18:07;"I kind of love it that it goes beyond the rational mind"
18:07;18:10;"because we can understand the nostalgia of the 420,"
18:10;18:15;"but then they throw in this baked potato element, kind of for no reason."
18:15;18:16;"Baked potatoes."
18:16;18:21;"Jake, to your question, half-baked potato has five stars on Yelp."
18:21;18:22;"Hell yeah."
18:22;18:23;"12 reviews."
18:23;18:24;"That's good."
18:24;18:25;"It's doing solid."
18:25;18:26;"Do you want to read one or two?"
18:26;18:27;"Yeah, yeah."
18:27;18:30;"I mean, I think there's a good representation here."
18:30;18:34;"Krista V wrote in April, ""As someone who loves potatoes,"
18:34;18:38;"I was excited to also see that they offer ramen and hot dogs,"
18:38;18:41;"two of my other favorites."""
18:41;18:44;"It was my first time trying, and I ordered online for pickup."
18:44;18:47;"When I walked in to get my order, I was greeted like a friend,"
18:47;18:49;"and I so appreciate that."
18:49;18:51;"The staff was so friendly and warm and even told me about some things"
18:51;18:53;"they have in the works."
18:53;18:54;"Okay."
18:54;18:58;"""So to get to my order, I tried the pork ramen with an added egg."""
18:58;19:02;"So this person, they love potatoes, but they've gone ramen first"
19:02;19:04;"on their first try."
19:04;19:06;"""It was super delicious."
19:06;19:08;"I've never had ramen with pulled pork, but it was really nice"
19:08;19:10;"and added a unique flavor."
19:10;19:11;"The egg was cooked and seasoned perfectly."
19:11;19:12;"The broth was amazing."
19:12;19:13;"I loved it all."
19:13;19:14;"I will definitely be coming back."""
19:14;19:15;"Maybe that answers my question."
19:15;19:16;"This is a home run."
19:16;19:20;"Because if every item is not--and every element is not done perfectly,"
19:20;19:21;"this is going to be a disaster."
19:21;19:24;"But if they actually have somebody who knows how to get the egg"
19:24;19:28;"just right for ramen and knows how to cook the pork just right,"
19:28;19:30;"it really comes down to the people."
19:30;19:32;"And it sounds like it's a friendly group of people."
19:32;19:34;"Because here's the thing."
19:34;19:37;"You can't be walking into a place like the Half-Baked Potato"
19:37;19:41;"and get some kind of sullen stoner."
19:41;19:42;"That'd be terrible."
19:42;19:44;"You'd walk in and some guy's like, ""Yeah?"""
19:44;19:48;"And you're just like, ""Um, can I get the Elvis hot dog?"""
19:48;19:49;"""What?"""
19:49;19:52;"""Oh, wait, which one is--okay, hold on."""
19:52;19:53;"That's going to kill the vibe."
19:53;19:57;"You need to walk in with friendly, motivated stoners"
19:57;20:00;"who maybe have worked in some pretty high-class restaurants."
20:00;20:03;"And it sounds like maybe that's what's going on here."

21:26;21:27;"I mean, that's a day."
21:27;21:29;"That's a St. Petersburg day."
21:29;21:31;"- As far as I'm concerned. - I love that this is in Florida."
21:31;21:33;"- Yeah, St. Petersburg on-- - Hot-ass Florida."
21:33;21:34;"On the beach?"
21:34;21:35;"Yeah."
21:35;21:36;"Is it Gulfside?"

21:37;21:38;"I'm pretty sure--"

21:48;21:50;"- Choose one-- - Coastal. So--"
21:50;21:52;"- I do have to say-- - That sounds kind as hell, man."
21:52;21:54;"On the-- What do you think this means?"
21:54;21:56;"So on the menu,"
21:56;21:59;"if I sort of, you know, pushed in a bit,"
21:59;22:01;"it says, ""Choose one of our signature potatoes"
22:01;22:04;"or BYO on the backside."""
22:04;22:07;"Does that mean you can-- You bring your own potato?"
22:07;22:08;"- BYO. - BYO."
22:08;22:10;"Choose one of our signature potatoes"
22:10;22:12;"or, oh, build your own."
22:12;22:13;"Oh, build your own."
22:13;22:15;"Yeah, I was like, what's the backside?"
22:15;22:17;"On the backside?"
22:17;22:18;"I don't know. On the backside."
22:18;22:20;"Like on the-- Like low-key?"
22:20;22:22;"It's like a hack."

22:35;22:37;"green onions, and sour cream."

22:42;22:44;"- Let me get the-- - Ideas are a dime a dozen."
22:44;22:46;"- It's all about execution. - Yeah."
22:46;22:48;"I'm still tripping out on the sushi,"
22:48;22:50;"just like the guy being like,"

23:14;23:16;"Well, the half-baked potato,"

23:18;23:19;"the more I like it."
23:19;23:21;"But why--"
23:21;23:24;"It still seems so random that they chose"
23:24;23:26;"baked potato as their"
23:26;23:28;"kind of unifying principle."
23:28;23:30;"Would a vampire play Tampa?"
23:30;23:32;"We actually have a great number of cards."
23:32;23:34;"We played St. Petersburg back in the day."
23:34;23:36;"Would we play Tampa?"
23:36;23:39;"I mean, in a heartbeat, I'd be open to the idea."
23:39;23:41;"Is there, like, a venue that we would play?"
23:41;23:43;"Wait, we played--"
23:43;23:45;"Did we just play St. Petersburg?"
23:45;23:47;"First result on setlist.fm"
23:47;23:51;"is you played Janice Live"
23:51;23:53;"in 2010"
23:53;23:55;"- on a Contra tour. - Yeah, that sounds familiar."
23:55;23:57;"With Beach House."
23:57;23:59;"Seems like it's been a minute."
23:59;24:01;"Well, maybe talk to your tour manager"
24:01;24:03;"about getting you routed through Tampa next time."
24:03;24:06;"- Make sure there's time allotted. - And I'm a rider."
24:06;24:08;"I'd love to hit Tampa."
24:08;24:09;"- I just don't think we ever-- - Half-baked."
24:09;24:11;"- I just don't think we ever-- - Oh, yeah, backstage."
24:11;24:13;"Hit Tampa. So, okay, we have played St. Petersburg,"
24:13;24:14;"so maybe we'll go back."
24:14;24:16;"Maybe. And, yeah, what do you think the vibe's gonna be"
24:16;24:18;"when people come to visit you backstage"
24:18;24:21;"and it's just full of half-baked potatoes?"
24:21;24:23;"I wonder if they have a mobile rig."
24:23;24:25;"They got to."
24:25;24:27;"We're just having a killer party."
24:27;24:30;"Oh, you were in Tampa 2014"
24:30;24:34;"on the Modern Vampires of the City tour."
24:34;24:37;"You played the Mid-Florida Credit Union Amphitheater."
24:37;24:40;"- Oh, yeah, that sounds familiar. - That is a great name."
24:40;24:44;"Mid-Florida Credit Union Amphitheater."
24:44;24:47;"I've never heard that term, ""mid-Florida."""
24:47;24:51;"We've definitely played a few credit union events."
24:51;24:53;"- Respect. - Oh, yeah."
24:53;24:55;"No, we had a great show in St. Augustine."
24:55;24:58;"Yeah, sometimes I get St. Augustine, St. Petersburg confused."
24:58;25:02;"In August 2019, we hit the St. Augustine Amphitheater"
25:02;25:03;"in St. Augustine, Florida,"
25:03;25:05;"but that's, like, the totally different side of Florida."
25:05;25:09;"- That's, like, way north. - North and on the Atlantic coast."
25:09;25:12;"All right, I'm gonna make sure we hit St. Pete's again"

26:58;27:00;"and I made some reference to Larry Norman,"
27:00;27:05;"who was, you know, widely credited as the father of Christian rock."
27:05;27:08;"And he started releasing records in the late '60s and early '70s."
27:08;27:11;"And you know me, I was just immediately like, ""What's that?"""
27:11;27:12;"Yeah, what's..."
27:12;27:16;"Like, the origins of Christian rock in the late '60s."
27:16;27:17;"Right."
27:17;27:19;"I remember the description was sort of like,"
27:19;27:21;"FM, like, rock from that era,"
27:21;27:24;"like FM radio rock from that era."
27:24;27:27;"Like it would fit right in with classic rock kind of palettes,"
27:27;27:31;"except for the subject matter and the lyrics."
27:31;27:32;"Yeah, so I don't know."
27:32;27:33;"I just have been always..."
27:33;27:35;"I made like a Larry Norman playlist."
27:35;27:38;"And I just thought his story was really interesting."
27:38;27:41;"I watched a doc that was on Amazon"
27:41;27:45;"that was made a few years ago that is low budge, but pretty good."
27:45;27:48;"And I mean, basically, like,"
27:48;27:51;"he was a dude that grew up in the South Bay"
27:51;27:54;"and he first had a band called People,"
27:54;27:56;"which had like kind of like a..."
27:56;27:57;"Great name for a band."
27:57;27:59;"Yeah, People with an exclamation point."
27:59;28:01;"And like, they had like some popularity."
28:01;28:03;"They like toured with The Who"
28:03;28:05;"and like opened for Hendrix and The Dead."
28:05;28:09;"Played The Matrix a bunch."
28:09;28:10;"Oh, in SF."
28:10;28:11;"Yeah."
28:11;28:12;"Freaky."
28:12;28:14;"And Larry had like, he was, you know,"
28:14;28:15;"had been a Christian his whole life."
28:15;28:17;"He wanted to name the first People record,"
28:17;28:21;"""We Need a Lot More Jesus and a Lot Less Rock and Roll."""
28:21;28:24;"And the other guys in the band were like,"
28:24;28:27;"""Um, I don't know about that, dude."""
28:27;28:28;"And then they were signed to Capitol"
28:28;28:31;"and Capitol was like, ""Yeah, not a good album title."""
28:31;28:35;"And then the band kind of split up over religious differences"
28:35;28:38;"because the other guys in the band were all Scientologists."
28:38;28:39;"Oh!"
28:39;28:42;"And so Larry like moves down to LA."
28:42;28:45;"Larry, you're too far out with this Jesus stuff, man."
28:45;28:47;"Yeah. Have you heard of Zinu?"
28:47;28:49;"Have you heard the good word?"
28:49;28:51;"So then Larry moves down to LA in like '68"
28:51;28:54;"and he still has a deal with Capitol."
28:54;28:57;"And he records an album, his first album,"
28:57;28:59;"called ""Upon This Rock,"" which is widely credited"
28:59;29:03;"as like the first straight up Christian rock record."
29:03;29:06;"Came out on Capitol Records in '69, I think."
29:06;29:08;"But he would spend like all day"
29:08;29:11;"just like walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard,"
29:11;29:13;"not with like a bullhorn or anything,"
29:13;29:16;"but just like trying to spread the good word."
29:16;29:18;"Like that's how he spent his days."
29:18;29:20;"And then he would like play gigs."
29:20;29:21;"Wow."
29:21;29:25;"He had like a very contentious relationship with the church"
29:25;29:27;"and with like organized religion."
29:27;29:30;"His songs weren't just like, ""God is great."""
29:30;29:33;"It was much more like deep into like scripture"
29:33;29:35;"and like the darker elements of the Bible"
29:35;29:37;"and like judgment day is coming."
29:37;29:38;"Whoa."
29:38;29:40;"And like, you have to get your soul in order"
29:40;29:42;"or you're gonna burn in hell."
29:42;29:44;"Like that's what a lot of his songs are."
29:44;29:47;"So a lot of like the Christian youth groups and stuff"
29:47;29:49;"that he would play for were just like,"
29:49;29:50;"""This is too heavy."""
29:50;29:52;"And plus he was bringing like,"
29:52;29:54;"the reason I like Larry Norman is that his music"
29:54;29:55;"is like good."
29:55;29:57;"Like I will throw on Larry Norman"
29:57;30:01;"for non-anthropological reasons."
30:01;30:03;"I got into him because I was like,"
30:03;30:05;"""What's the deal with early Christian rock?"""
30:05;30:07;"Right, but he's actually, he can really play."
30:07;30:08;"He's a great writer."
30:08;30:10;"But anyway, I found this thing online"
30:10;30:12;"that was like a memoir he wrote."
30:12;30:15;"And I pulled a few quotes that were kind of interesting"
30:15;30:18;"about his mindset in the late 60s."
30:18;30:21;"So just picture like ""What's Upon a Time in Hollywood?"""
30:21;30:24;"And it's like Brad Pitt's at like a stoplight"
30:24;30:25;"on like Hollywood Boulevard."
30:25;30:26;"And then in the background,"
30:26;30:29;"there's just like this long haired Jesus looking dude."
30:29;30:30;"Right."
30:30;30:34;"Who's just like talking to someone about the good Lord."
30:34;30:35;"So Larry's vibe was like,"
30:35;30:37;"""Yet at the same time, I had very little interest"
30:37;30:40;"in cultivating endorsements from the church."
30:40;30:41;"I was out to create a dialogue"
30:41;30:44;"with people who believe they hated God."
30:44;30:46;"I wanted to be on the battlefield,"
30:46;30:48;"fighting a spiritual battle,"
30:48;30:50;"trying to convince and convert the undecided"
30:50;30:52;"and to get them to cross the battle line"
30:52;30:55;"to stand together with other new believers."
30:55;30:56;"Though I may have been an error"
30:56;30:58;"in standing aside from the brethren"
30:58;31:00;"by not performing for them,"
31:00;31:03;"the established church was simply immaterial to me."
31:03;31:05;"I had been witnessing since I was in primary school"
31:05;31:08;"and now in Los Angeles, up and down Hollywood Boulevard."
31:08;31:11;"In 1968, I spent all of my concert income"
31:11;31:15;"on establishing and maintaining a Christian halfway house."
31:15;31:17;"I had played at the Troubadour and the Hollywood Bowl,"
31:17;31:20;"witnessing before and after the performances"
31:20;31:22;"on the streets during the day"
31:22;31:24;"and to the people after the shows."
31:24;31:25;"When I was working the boulevards,"
31:25;31:27;"I never mentioned that I played guitar,"
31:27;31:29;"wrote songs, had made records."
31:29;31:32;"My encounters were one-on-one, quiet and personal."
31:32;31:34;"I did not hand out Bible tracks"
31:34;31:37;"and try to preach on the sidewalk through a bullhorn."
31:37;31:39;"I waited until I felt God was saying,"
31:39;31:41;"""Go talk to this person."""
31:41;31:42;"And so then after a while, he did,"
31:42;31:45;"like, I guess there were a lot of Christian coffee houses"
31:45;31:48;"in the early '70s, which was interesting to read about."
31:48;31:50;"So he started playing some of those."
31:50;31:51;"He goes, ""When I'd finally played"
31:51;31:54;"""in Christian coffee houses, it was somewhat of a vacation,"
31:54;31:56;"""a nice change from bashing my head"
31:56;31:59;"""against the cultural, secular wall for a short time."
31:59;32:01;"""I was getting weary of trying to be heard"
32:01;32:03;"""by the hate-ashberry crowd."
32:03;32:05;"""I'd opened for Jimi Hendrix, the Doors,"
32:05;32:08;"""the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, the Byrds,"
32:08;32:10;"""and found no one backstage who was interested"
32:10;32:12;"""in anything beyond their own fame"
32:12;32:14;"""and whatever free drugs were available."
32:14;32:17;"""The audiences out front seemed to be stoned"
32:17;32:19;"""even before they showed up at the Fillmore,"
32:19;32:22;"""the Matrix, or the Avalon Ballroom."""
32:22;32:26;"So just picture him backstage, opening for the dead,"
32:26;32:28;"and just running into Phil Lash and being like,"
32:28;32:29;"""Hey, brother."""
32:29;32:31;"(laughing)"
32:31;32:33;"- Phil is just like, ""I'm just trying to score some hash, man."""
32:33;32:35;"And it's also interesting to think, too,"
32:35;32:39;"I think this is true in a lot of movements and moments."
32:39;32:43;"Sometimes, even with a very fervent movement,"
32:43;32:45;"like the hippie movement, you're still gonna get"
32:45;32:47;"some really disappointed true believers."
32:47;32:50;"'Cause imagine you're this long-haired dude"
32:50;32:55;"and you have this deep relationship to God, Christ, whatever."
32:55;32:57;"In your own counter-cultural way,"
32:57;32:59;"you're saying he wasn't into the church."
32:59;33:02;"In a really deep way, you see all these long-haired,"
33:02;33:05;"quote-unquote, Jesus-looking people come together"
33:05;33:08;"to open up a new age of peace, love, and understanding."
33:08;33:11;"You're probably thinking, ""Wow, I'm literally living"
33:11;33:14;"""through prophecy. This is amazing."""
33:14;33:15;"- Yeah."
33:15;33:17;"- People are opening their mind to bigger ideas."
33:17;33:19;"And then I can totally see that you're like,"
33:19;33:21;"""And this is where it's at. I'm at the center of it."
33:21;33:24;"""This is amazing. Everything's coming together."""
33:24;33:26;"And then you actually go to the show"
33:26;33:31;"and you still see normal showbiz vibes."
33:31;33:33;"You just see people kind of whacked out on drugs."
33:33;33:35;"And you're just like, kind of--"
33:35;33:36;"You could see how a guy like that would be"
33:36;33:37;"just pretty disappointed."
33:37;33:38;"- Yeah."
33:38;33:40;"- Everything about that movement probably looked"
33:40;33:42;"like exactly what he was hoping for in life."
33:42;33:46;"This perfect combination of Jesus-type ideals"
33:46;33:48;"plus cool music."
33:48;33:49;"And then he gets in the middle of it"
33:49;33:50;"and he can't really find it."
33:50;33:52;"Must have been very disappointing."
33:52;33:55;"- Yeah. No, I mean, you know, like with this show,"
33:55;33:58;"whether we're talking about ""Mad Men"" or anything else,"
33:58;34:01;"that moment of the '60s idealism,"
34:01;34:04;"""Curtling,"" yeah, like Eagle songs, Don Henley songs."
34:04;34:05;"- Right."
34:05;34:08;"- And then this was another strand of that."
34:08;34:09;"- Right."
34:09;34:10;"- ""I'm Not Afraid You're a Hippie."""
34:10;34:13;"I mean, yeah, 'cause a lot of hippies became Christians."
34:13;34:14;"- Right."
34:14;34:15;"It's a very logical step."
34:15;34:18;"- And I listened to some other Christian rock from the era"
34:18;34:19;"and it's like, it's just like,"
34:19;34:21;"it's very like forgettable music."
34:21;34:22;"- Mm."
34:22;34:23;"- Wait, so why don't we listen to--"
34:23;34:24;"- Yeah, we should--"
34:24;34:25;"- Just start at the top."
34:25;34:26;"- ""UFO""?"
34:26;34:27;"- ""UFO."""
34:27;34:28;"- I know you've sent this to me"
34:28;34:29;"and I've listened to some of this before,"
34:29;34:31;"but I don't totally remember,"
34:31;34:32;"but I'm interested."
34:32;34:35;"Why is the father of Christian rock"
34:35;34:37;"writing a song called ""UFO""?"
34:37;34:39;"I'm very interested to hear."
34:39;34:42;"(soft music)"
34:42;34:44;"So what year is this?"
34:44;34:47;"- This is like, I think '76."

42:18;42:21;"The string arrangement, it's a little bit like Nico."
42:21;42:22;"Christian Nico."

42:25;42:28;"Something about his aesthetic is so..."
42:28;42:30;"He's a great songwriter."
42:30;42:34;"And it's coming out of the same aesthetic ferment of..."
42:34;42:35;"- A lot of classics."

43:15;43:19;"- I wonder if Elvis heard Larry Norman."
43:19;43:21;"- Interesting."
43:21;43:25;"- I was reading that Frank Black from the Pixies"
43:25;43:28;"is a huge Larry Norman head."
43:28;43:30;"And apparently when Larry Norman died,"
43:30;43:32;"he was working on a record with Frank Black"
43:32;43:35;"and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse."
43:35;43:36;"- Whoa."
43:36;43:38;"- And then I was reading this other thing too,"
43:38;43:41;"like U2 famously, like a low-key Christian band."
43:41;43:42;"- Right."
43:42;43:46;"- How Bono had met with all these Nashville songwriters"
43:46;43:50;"back in the early 2000s before Larry Norman died."
43:50;43:51;"And he showed up and he's like,"
43:51;43:53;"""Is Larry Norman gonna come?"""
43:53;43:54;"He asked for Larry Norman."
43:54;43:55;"- 'Cause he knew this music?"
43:55;43:56;"- Yeah."
43:56;43:57;"- Like what we've been listening to?"
43:57;43:58;"- Bono apparently."
43:58;43:59;"- It just circulated and--"
43:59;44:00;"- Yeah."
44:00;44:01;"- I guess in the Christian scene."
44:01;44:02;"- Yeah."
44:02;44:04;"I think that last record he made from,"
44:04;44:06;"or not the last, he made a ton of,"
44:06;44:09;"his career gets very confusing as the '80s progressed"
44:09;44:12;"'cause there's a ton of sort of like bootlegs"
44:12;44:16;"and like re-releases and like every album"
44:16;44:19;"like after the first four, you would read about it"
44:19;44:23;"and there'd be like a three-year protracted legal battle."
44:23;44:26;"Like every album was on like a different label."
44:26;44:29;"His career sort of became like very hard to track."
44:29;44:31;"- And he was living in London for a while."
44:31;44:33;"- Yeah, he moved to London."
44:33;44:35;"Apparently went to a lot of punk shows."
44:35;44:36;"- Oh, so open-minded guy."
44:36;44:37;"- Yeah."
44:37;44:39;"- He says he saw Richard Hell and the Voidoids,"
44:39;44:41;"The Damned and the Dead Boys."
44:41;44:44;"He initially disliked the lyrical content of punk."
44:44;44:46;"He was supportive of its youthful energy"
44:46;44:47;"and preferred it to disco."
44:47;44:48;"Interesting."
44:48;44:50;"(laughing)"
44:50;44:51;"And like, did he have a family?"
44:51;44:53;"You know anything about that?"
44:53;44:55;"- I know he was married."
44:55;44:57;"I don't know if he had children."
44:57;44:59;"You would think he would have,"
44:59;45:00;"being a Christian man and all."
45:00;45:01;"- Right."
45:01;45:04;"- I don't know if he had any crossover with Elvis,"
45:04;45:07;"though many articles call him the Elvis of Christian rock."
45:07;45:09;"I mean, that's sort of how he's known."
45:09;45:11;"- Yeah, the John Lennon of Christian rock,"
45:11;45:12;"the Elvis of Christian rock."
45:12;45:13;"- But he did write a song--"
45:13;45:14;"- He was the king of rock of Christian rock."
45:14;45:15;"- Yes."
45:15;45:19;"- But he did write a song called Elvis Has Left the Building."
45:19;45:20;"- Oh, wow."
45:20;45:21;"Let's check it out."
45:21;45:23;"I wonder if it's like late period Larry."
45:23;45:24;"- It's definitely--"
45:24;45:25;"- See, but it's weird--"
45:25;45:27;"- It's definitely a late period Larry."
45:27;45:28;"- Oh, hell yeah."
45:28;45:30;"His look is also awesome."
45:30;45:32;"Just like bangs with like the long blonde hair."
45:32;45:33;"- Long blonde hair."
45:33;45:35;"- But like people call him like the Elvis"
45:35;45:37;"or the John Lennon of Christian rock,"
45:37;45:40;"but those are like beloved figures."
45:40;45:43;"Like Larry was, his, everything I was reading,"
45:43;45:46;"it just, he seemed like he had a very contagious relationship"
45:46;45:48;"with like his audience and like--"
45:48;45:50;"- Yeah, that's not an appropriate comparison."
45:50;45:51;"- The record industry."
45:51;45:53;"Yeah, it's like, it's much, it's too like,"
45:53;45:54;"he's too like embittered."
45:54;45:57;"- Right, and I imagine, you know,"
45:57;45:58;"I don't totally know here,"
45:58;46:02;"but I imagine in the 60s was the start of kind of like"
46:02;46:05;"alternative forms of Christianity taking hold."
46:05;46:08;"So probably like you were saying that a lot of the church"
46:08;46:11;"denounced him and you could imagine by like the 90s"
46:11;46:14;"when you have these really big Christian rock bands,"
46:14;46:17;"the DC Talks or whoever bands that we've all at least heard of,"
46:17;46:19;"you can imagine by then,"
46:19;46:21;"like the counterculture had done its thing"
46:21;46:24;"and probably anybody in a power position at a church"
46:24;46:26;"by the 90s would just welcome"
46:26;46:29;"any sort of alternative Christianity thing"
46:29;46:31;"that might win back the youth."
46:31;46:33;"- Yeah, something that had some like cache"
46:33;46:35;"in like cultural circles."
46:35;46:38;"- Right, and even if it was like a little bit out there,"
46:38;46:40;"well, let's check this out."
46:40;46:41;"Elvis has left the building."
46:41;46:44;"This is from, this is from '94."

49:34;49:35;"- As you do."
49:35;49:36;"- As one does."
49:36;49:38;"And I randomly saw this movie"
49:38;49:42;"I'd never seen, a 1990 film called Miami Blues"
49:42;49:44;"starring Alec Baldwin."
49:44;49:45;"- Not familiar."
49:45;49:47;"- Very weird movie."
49:47;49:49;"He plays this kind of like insane guy"
49:49;49:50;"who just got out of prison,"
49:50;49:53;"he just lands in Miami and just immediately"
49:53;49:55;"kills someone at the airport."
49:55;49:57;"It's very weird, he's like a nut."
49:57;49:58;"- Did you watch the whole movie?"
49:58;50:00;"- I watched the whole movie, but it opens,"
50:00;50:02;"you would enjoy it, it's like a weird time capsule"
50:02;50:04;"and it's like 1990 Miami."
50:04;50:05;"- Wow."
50:05;50:06;"- Very gritty."
50:06;50:07;"- I would love to see this."
50:07;50:09;"- Anyway, the movie opens and closes"
50:09;50:12;"with Spirit in the Sky, which I hadn't heard in a while."
50:12;50:14;"I don't know too much about this song."
50:14;50:16;"The song you always hear is that this guy's named"
50:16;50:18;"Norman Greenbaum, super Jewish name."
50:18;50:19;"- Yeah."
50:19;50:20;"- And he's like a Jewish guy who just like"
50:20;50:22;"wrote this song, just like came to him."
50:22;50:24;"'Cause it's all about Jesus."
50:24;50:26;"And you really listen to it and it's like"
50:26;50:27;"such cool tones."
50:27;50:31;"(guitar music)"
50:31;50:34;"- Is that like a guitar?"
50:34;50:36;"- I guess, and there's this part."

51:07;51:11;"Why don't you tell me what you did in your life, Norman?"

51:13;51:15;"- Total one hit wonder, too."
51:15;51:17;"- Yeah, wonder what he did."
51:17;51:19;"- I think he kinda retired from music."

55:37;55:40;"♫ Do do do do do do do do"
55:40;55:43;"- It is Jesus is just all right with me, right?"
55:43;55:46;"- Right, he's just all right."
55:46;55:49;"♫ He's just all right"
55:54;55:56;"- Key song in Days of Confused, right?"
55:56;55:59;"- Oh, yeah, it's a real Days of Confused one."
56:04;56:07;"- I mean, it's not yet, not a glowing endorsement."
56:07;56:09;"- Just all right."
56:12;56:16;"♫ I don't care what they may say"
56:16;56:19;"♫ I don't care what they may do"
56:19;56:22;"- This is kind of like Santana Light."
56:22;56:25;"♫ Hey, Jesus is just all right"
56:25;56:29;"♫ Oh yeah, Jesus is just all right"
56:32;56:35;"♫ Do do do do do do do do"
56:35;56:39;"♫ Do do do do do do do"
56:39;56:42;"♫ Do do do do do do do"
56:48;56:51;"♫ Jesus is just all right with me"
56:51;56:53;"♫ Jesus is just all right"
56:53;56:58;"♫ Oh yeah, Jesus is just all right with me"
56:58;57:01;"♫ Jesus is just all right"
57:01;57:03;"- Not a great song."
57:03;57:05;"- No spirit in the sky, and either Larry Norman,"
57:05;57:07;"we should close out with?"
57:07;57:10;"- Oh yeah, hold on, I was just looking up Stephen Stills."
57:10;57:12;"♫ Jesus is just all right with me"
57:12;57:15;"- Let's go out on an up note, right?"
57:15;57:16;"- Yeah."
57:16;57:19;"- Let's do Peace, Pollution, Revolution."
57:20;57:22;"- So what era is this?"
57:22;57:24;"- Like '71 or something."
57:24;57:26;"- Okay."
57:29;57:33;"♫ The word is revolution"
57:33;57:35;"♫ But no one's fired the shots"
57:35;57:38;"- A little like Van, totally."
57:38;57:41;"- Yeah, his up-tempo stuff is like nimble."
57:41;57:44;"He never gets into like sludgy, heavy stuff."
57:44;57:48;"♫ As we near the battle line"
57:48;57:50;"♫ But if you're truly wise"
57:50;57:53;"♫ You keep your eyes on Palestine"
57:53;57:56;"- Whoa, keep your eyes on Palestine."
58:01;58:03;"- That's like Maripa."
58:05;58:07;"♫ The water is polluted"
58:07;58:10;"♫ And the air is filled with death"
58:10;58:13;"♫ Someday it won't be easy"
58:13;58:16;"♫ To stop and catch your breath"
58:16;58:19;"♫ But it's all in revelation"
58:19;58:22;"♫ It's part of the design"
58:22;58:25;"♫ If you're truly wise"
58:25;58:28;"♫ You keep your eyes on Palestine"
58:28;58:29;"- Whoa."
58:29;58:31;"- He's always just like, the world is crap,"
58:31;58:33;"it's dirty, it's polluted."
58:33;58:34;"It's supposed to be like this,"
58:34;58:36;"'cause Revelation said it."
58:36;58:38;"We're at the end of the world."
58:38;58:41;"♫ La la la la la la"
58:41;58:43;"- So you can see why it wasn't popular."
58:43;58:46;"- Yeah, yeah, right, it's really interesting."
58:46;58:52;"So was he at peace with the world going so wrong"
58:52;58:54;"because it's part of the design?"
58:54;58:57;"- I think 'cause he felt he had God in his heart."
58:57;58:58;"- Yeah."
58:58;58:59;"- I think he was."
58:59;59:01;"I mean, he was making really,"
59:01;59:04;"I think really like affirmative art."
59:04;59:08;"Like very uplifting, beautiful art"
59:08;59:11;"dealing with troubling subject matter."
59:11;59:14;"Maybe that's why I'm so interested in him."
59:14;59:16;"'Cause a lot of my favorite artists"
59:16;59:18;"kind of work in that mode."
59:18;59:21;"♫ If you're truly wise"
59:21;59:25;"♫ You keep your eyes on Palestine"
59:25;59:27;"♫ La la la la la la"
59:27;59:28;"- I mean, it's a little bit like"
59:28;59:30;"Bruce Springsteen, Born in the USA."
59:30;59:34;"Like the verses are about like these Vietnam vets"
59:34;59:35;"having a real tough time."
59:35;59:36;"- Yeah."
59:36;59:39;"- In this kind of inverted patriotism"
59:39;59:41;"with this triumphant chorus."
59:41;59:43;"But you know what, Larry's the Bruce Springsteen"
59:43;59:44;"of Christian rock."
59:44;59:45;"- Right."
59:45;59:48;"You could even see like a really religious person"
59:48;59:49;"hearing this song and being like,"
59:49;59:50;"""Wait, what are you trying to,"
59:50;59:53;"""what exactly are you saying, Larry?"""
59:53;59:54;"- Yeah, this is a bummer."
59:54;59:56;"- Because he's not even saying"
59:56;59:59;"all these bad things are happening in the world"
59:59;01:00:02;"but have faith, God's on our side."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"It's more cryptic, all these bad things are happening"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"but listen to me, you keep your eyes on Palestine."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"- Yeah."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"♫ La la la la la la"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"♫ La la la la la la la la"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"♫ La la la la la la la la la"

01:00:24;01:00:26;"♫ La la la la la la la la la"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"- Matt just sent over a tweet"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"from this guy Gregory Thornberry"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"who actually wrote a biography of Larry Norman"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"which I read part of a while ago."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"But here's a tweet,"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"""Larry Norman once opened up for Van Morrison."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"""He noticed that Van asked the band to take long solos."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"""During each, he strode over to the grand piano"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"""and bowed his head."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"""At first, Larry thought,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"""'He's so deeply moved by the music.'"
01:00:49;01:00:53;"""Then he realized, 'Oh, he's reading the newspaper.'"""
01:00:53;01:00:55;"(laughing)"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"- Just Van back to the audience, head bowed."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- Van drunk."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"- Just reading that day's newspaper"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"flattened out on top of the piano."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"♫ And if you're truly wise"
01:01:07;01:01:10;"♫ You keep your eyes on Palestine"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"- I have to follow this guy Gregory Thornberry."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"Author, why should the devil have all the good music?"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"Larry Norman and the Perils of Christian Rock."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"- Oh, I mean."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- I gotta crack that book again."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"I started it and then it ended up"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"on the bottom of a stack of books, you know?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"It sat there for like a year."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"- Move it to the top of the pile now."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"- I gotta move to the top."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"♫ And if you're truly wise"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"♫ You keep your eyes on Palestine"
01:01:34;01:01:37;"(laughing)"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"- Larry Norman, wow, thanks for that, Jake."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"He's a deep dude."
01:01:42;01:01:45;"Because this is a banked up, we're not trying to hide it."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"It's a banked up, a recently banked up."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"So rather than do the top five"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"for whatever day we're recording this,"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"we decided to do something a little more evergreen."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"Our producer, Matt, pulled the top alternative songs"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"from the weeks each of us turned 18."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"The alternative songs chart, by the way,"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"was known as the Modern Rock Charts before 2009."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- Modern Rock."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"- So this is more like the Modern Rock Songs"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"from when we turned 18."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"This is the moment that we officially entered adulthood."
01:02:16;01:02:22;"This is what we were jamming on alternative radio."
01:02:22;01:02:27;"- So this is 1995 and 2002 or one?"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"- So you turned 18."
01:02:29;01:02:33;"- In '95, February of '95."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"- And I did in April 2002."
01:02:37;01:02:41;"- Okay, I think mine is gonna absolutely mop the floor."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"- '95 versus 2002, I mean the truth is--"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- I'm gonna crush."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- Mid '90s?"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"- Yeah, it's gonna crush."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"I mean, the truth is,"
01:02:52;01:02:56;"I probably listen to alternative radio more often"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"when I was 11 in 1995."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"By 2002, I'm trying to even remember"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"what was going on musically then."
01:03:03;01:03:08;"By 2002, I was pretty deep into everything."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"I wasn't guided by the radio, not to brag,"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"but just like--"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- No, you were a music nerd."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- I was a music nerd."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"I was buying deep records and CDs"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"and going to other music."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- And the stuff on the radio sucked in 2002."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"- It was getting worse and worse."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"And I feel like even my local station, KROQ,"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"not to be confused with K-R-O-Q in LA,"
01:03:33;01:03:36;"but K-ROQ, R-O-C-K in New York,"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"I feel like that had almost changed formats at that point."
01:03:39;01:03:43;"Maybe not quite, but yeah, in 2002 also,"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"I vividly remember, let's see,"
01:03:46;01:03:51;"in 2000, my slightly older buddy, Andre,"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"who I mentioned in the last episode,"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"works at Dimes, he went to college"
01:03:56;01:04:00;"for a semester at BU, and I went to visit him."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"And I vividly, so, okay, so he was a freshman at BU,"
01:04:03;01:04:09;"probably like fall 2000, and I took the train to Boston,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"and we hung out for a weekend,"
01:04:11;01:04:15;"and I vividly remember him showing me Napster"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"for the first time, or maybe at Soul Seek."
01:04:18;01:04:22;"It was kind of like a cooler file sharing service."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"So I kind of remember by 2000,"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"being in early file sharing era,"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"and what music, he was probably listening"
01:04:31;01:04:36;"to all sorts of weird stuff, Auditor, Warp Records,"
01:04:36;01:04:40;"and he liked some deep stuff, Momus, and Piano Magic."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"Just by 2002, I was already a few years deep"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"into this alternate universe of record stores, Soul Seek,"
01:04:47;01:04:50;"just a slightly wider spectrum."
01:04:50;01:04:53;"But I still was interested in what was going on then."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"But yeah, when I think of 2002,"
01:04:55;01:04:59;"feels like a much less classic era than '95."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"But let's see."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"(electronic music)"
01:05:01;01:05:07;"- It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:05:07;01:05:11;"- Okay, so we're gonna start with the number five song,"
01:05:11;01:05:16;"Jake, in your year, Bush, Everything Zen."
01:05:16;01:05:19;"Is that a strong start in your worldview?"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"- I think it's gonna be strong in context"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"to what's gonna come in 2002."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"I think at the time, I thought Bush was pretty weak."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"- Right."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"- But then when we get into like Hoobastank or something,"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"Bush is gonna sound like the kinks in comparison."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"(laughing)"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"- And I'll point out, I had this CD."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"There's something about, I liked a few Bush songs,"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"but I feel like maybe I got it"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"through Columbia House or something."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"I feel like you probably, yeah,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"I could totally imagine you hearing Bush"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"and just being like you remember when Nevermind came out"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"and you're probably like, Bush sucks."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"I don't know why, where I grew up, everybody had this CD."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Everybody had 16 Stone."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"This was like, (laughing)"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"sad to say, this was like Nevermind."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"- I never owned this, but yeah."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- This is like Nevermind for silverback millennials."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- Absolutely."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"(electronic music)"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"I feel like this album was produced by Steve Albini."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"- It sounds pretty good."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"- No, my bad, it wasn't."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"Steve Albini produced Razorblade Suitcase,"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"which is the one album."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"(electronic music)"
01:06:25;01:06:29;"This actually sounds great."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"(electronic music)"
01:06:32;01:06:41;"So this is the first Bush hit, I think."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- I think so."
01:06:44;01:06:47;"- I should have thought of those lyrics."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"- Great lyrics."

01:24:51;01:24:52;"It's a..."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"It's the cover of the bands,"
01:24:54;01:24:57;"which you might recall is kind of like a crash test dummy"
01:24:57;01:25:00;"looking mannequin face with its mouth open."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"You could either interpret that as being kind of in pain"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"or in ecstasy, it's unsure."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"But where it says Radiohead,"
01:25:07;01:25:11;"somebody, a very smart, funny person,"
01:25:11;01:25:15;"changed the place where it said Radiohead to say road (beep)"
01:25:15;01:25:19;"and on first glance, the words are so similar."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"And if you don't know what road (beep) is,"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"then I'm going to assume you don't need to know."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"And then instead of saying the bands,"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"it says the best."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"And there's just something about that,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"that mannequin face with,"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"it starts to look like a smile."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"- Yeah, it recontextualized the face."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"- And there's something so stupid about it to me,"
01:25:39;01:25:43;"but there's like smiling dummy and just road (beep)"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"and the best."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"Especially because Radiohead is very serious."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- They're so serious."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"- So Radiohead, the bands, turned into road (beep)"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"the best."
01:25:55;01:25:57;"- Yeah, I mean, you always assume"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"that the face on that cover is in pain"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"and it's called the bands."
01:26:01;01:26:04;"And it's a Radiohead album, they're serious."
01:26:04;01:26:09;"It can only be agony that's being expressed on that cover."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"It never occurred to anyone that it was pleasure."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"And it completely flips it on its head."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"It's just like, the best."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"(laughing)"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"(beep)"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"- You should send that to Ed O'Brien."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"- If it wasn't Radiohead, I think it's too deep."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"- How do you set that up for Ed O'Brien"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"so that he takes it in the spirit of-"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"- Yeah, we don't know each other quite well enough."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"- What's road (beep)"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"- I think you got to preamble like,"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"just so you know, you got to explain it before you send it."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"- Cheers, mate. What the (beep) is this?"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"(laughing)"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"- Send to Tom, question mark?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"(laughing)"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Please forward to Tom."
01:26:45;01:26:49;"I mean, I sent it to a lot of just random people I know."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"For a lot of people, I just sent it to them."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Would you wear this?"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"- Oh, the classic, would you wear?"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"- Would you wear?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"I think we need to get this shirt"
01:26:57;01:27:00;"and Jake needs to wear it to his local coffee shop."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- Absolutely."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"There's no world where I'm wearing that shirt."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"- Here's the thing, it's not even that aggressive"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"because most people will look at it"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"and really just think you're wearing a Radiohead,"
01:27:10;01:27:13;"the Benz shirt because road (beep) Radiohead looks so similar"
01:27:13;01:27:14;"when they're written out in the same font."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"- It's just going to be some,"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"the person who's going to notice is some 23 year old woman"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"who's just at her laptop sitting at the thing"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"that's like looking at it for usually three, four times."
01:27:24;01:27:28;"And then finally she's like, what the (beep)"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"- Oh, like I love that album."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"- I can't, there's no way."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"- You know what you do, you send it to Liam Gallagher."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"- Ooh."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"- You say, you know, you test the humor over there."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"You say, would Tom like this?"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"- Liam, I know you're not a fan of Radiohead."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"(laughing)"
01:27:41;01:27:45;"- But what do you think about those hard school lads?"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"Oh man."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"- It's kind of like there's nobody quite right to send it to"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"other than the Crisis crew and a few of my kooky friends"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"because if somebody is a hardcore Radiohead fan"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"will just be like, it's not funny."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"(laughing)"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"How dare you?"
01:28:00;01:28:05;"That's a problem with like a certain type of meme"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"and probably why our culture is doomed"
01:28:07;01:28:11;"is that there's certain memes that you find so funny"
01:28:11;01:28:14;"and yet as opposed to other more traditional forms of humor"
01:28:14;01:28:17;"it's like very difficult to share."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"I don't know if you guys ever have this"
01:28:18;01:28:22;"that you're hanging out and you just kind of laugh to yourself"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"and somebody says, what's so funny?"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"And you know, I picture like if that happened in the 70s"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"you'd probably just be like, all right,"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"well I was just thinking about last night"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"me and Bradley were out at the bar."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"You would like have a story where it's not that funny"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"and I'm just like, all right, what's so funny?"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"It's literally, it happens to me all the time."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"I'm just like sitting like in the kitchen"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"just like laughing, like kind of laughing to myself"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"and she's like, what's so funny?"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"And I'm literally like--"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"- It's gonna take 40 minutes to explain."
01:28:45;01:28:48;"- Like, do you know the Radiohead album, The Bends?"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"- No."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- I think so."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"Can you picture the cover?"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"No."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"Okay, this is the cover."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Really take it in."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"All right, hold on a second."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Let me find."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Okay, now look at this."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"It says road (beep)"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"- The bend."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- Yeah, having to explain it."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"You're like, ah."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"You gotta explain the joke."
01:29:07;01:29:10;"- Okay, back to the number three song, Jake's here."

01:30:41;01:30:43;"- I wonder how many of those songs in the second record"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"were already written before the first record."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"- Right."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"♪ I wanna say ♪"
01:30:47;01:30:51;"♪ You and I are gonna live forever ♪"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"(audience cheering)"
01:30:54;01:31:07;"- I like Oasis more now than I did then."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"- Hmm."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"- I didn't like them then."
01:31:09;01:31:13;"I didn't like it was so referential to classic rock."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"- Right."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"- To the point where I was just like,"
01:31:15;01:31:16;"well, these guys are just goofy."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"- Yeah, and you're a bit older."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"- I liked Champagne Supernova and Wonderwall."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"- Mm-hmm."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"- I was like, they were just so ubiquitous."
01:31:25;01:31:26;"- Yeah."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"- But I truly loved Don't Look Back in Anger."
01:31:29;01:31:30;"- Yeah."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"- I could see being like seven years older,"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"'cause you had been like in college by then,"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"but did you like Don't Look Back in Anger?"
01:31:37;01:31:40;"- I did, 'cause that song is so unimpeachable, right?"
01:31:40;01:31:41;"- Yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- I mean, I remember hearing that,"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"and it was just on the radio."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- Yeah."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"- And I was listening to the alternative rock station."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"- Yeah."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"- But I didn't know who it was,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"and it's also Noel singing it."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- Oh, right."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"- So it doesn't have that characteristic Liam kind of sneer."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"- Less aggressive."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"- And I was like, are they playing like a weird"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"George Harrison song that I've never heard before?"
01:32:01;01:32:05;"Like, I had this weird like moment of dislocation."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"- But this is so referential too."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"- I know."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"- I mean, as Noel famously said."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"- Imagine."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"- How come when I do it, it's a rip off,"
01:32:17;01:32:20;"when Radiohead does it, it's pastiche?"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"(laughing)"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"- It's an homage."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"- Oh yeah, maybe he said, yeah."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"He said, when I do it, it's a rip off,"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"when Radiohead does it, it's an homage."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"- I remember getting hip to that when I was like"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"getting serious about art,"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"and I'd like go to exhibitions"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"and like read the press releases."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"And I'd be looking at someone's work"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"that was like completely derivative"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"of someone very specific."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"- But they would frame it as homage."
01:32:43;01:32:47;"- And I'd be like, oh, they're looking to this artist"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"from the 70s, or they're doing an homage"
01:32:49;01:32:50;"to this artist from the 70s."
01:32:50;01:32:53;"I'd be like, okay, I see how this,"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"they're cooking the books here."

01:35:47;01:35:48;"- Classic Phil."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"You could make the case too that,"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"when you're doing kind of a throwback thing"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"that almost sounds like it could be a George Harrison song,"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"to do it well enough that it really connects"
01:35:57;01:35:58;"and people love it."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"- Mm-hmm."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"- Is maybe as hard, if not harder,"
01:36:01;01:36:05;"than creating something fresh and new and innovative."
01:36:05;01:36:06;"I would like really rank--"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"- That's an interesting argument."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"- I really rank them similarly."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"- Yeah."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"- Because so many people try to do this"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"and fail miserably."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"- Oh, there's some, yeah, forgettable,"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"kind of Beatle-esque power pop bands."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"- Yeah, I would say the B-minus version of this"
01:36:19;01:36:23;"is hated on, nobody, disrespected."
01:36:23;01:36:26;"The B-minus version of Radiohead"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"might still get some good reviews."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"You know what I mean?"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"This, you have to get the bullseye."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- Yeah, this is a real tightrope walk."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"And then, of course, Radiohead hits the bullseye"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"of what they're doing as well."
01:36:38;01:36:42;"So it's not even about Oasis versus Radiohead necessarily."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"Such a specific feeling."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"- Great album cover."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"- And not surprising that they--"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"- Yeah, great album cover."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"- Not surprising that they couldn't sustain it"
01:36:54;01:36:55;"for that long."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"- Yeah, they just nailed it so hard."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"- Yeah, two albums."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"They're almost like G and R or something."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"- Kind of."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"- '90s G and R, like absolute, like,"
01:37:04;01:37:08;"egomaniac, like, reckless dudes, huge egos."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"- So much confidence."
01:37:10;01:37:14;"Referencing the '70s and '60s music they loved."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"And then just out."
01:37:15;01:37:18;"- Yeah, but I mean, we did that whole long one,"
01:37:18;01:37:19;"I think during the pandemic,"
01:37:19;01:37:22;"talking about Noel Gallagher interviews"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"and obviously recently we were talking about Liam."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"But I do think there is something like,"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"I'm sure there's more to the story,"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"but I do, I've always,"
01:37:29;01:37:32;"my interpretation of Oasis will always be that like,"
01:37:32;01:37:37;"their performative overconfidence"
01:37:37;01:37:41;"actually underneath it is like a type of chillness"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"that at least with the old Noel interviews,"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"there's always this like talking all this (beep)"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"and then there's like a little bit of like,"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"yeah, but you know,"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"I'm just trying to keep things interesting."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Rock and roll, baby."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"Come on, let's have some fun."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"- Taking the (beep)"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"- Yeah, whereas like there are people who are like,"
01:37:55;01:37:58;"sometimes there's a bit of a paradox."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"People who are like kind of more humble,"
01:38:00;01:38:03;"but also like actually like angrier and faker."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"You know what I mean?"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"- Oh, those like fake beta."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"- Yeah, yeah, right."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"- Oh yeah, I know plenty of guys like that."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"- Yeah."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"- Art world."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"- Oh, a lot of fake beta."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"- Just like, yeah, you're just sort of like,"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"there's like seething rage underneath,"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"but your, our presentation is sort of like"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"sensitive like art bro."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"- Right."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"- Yeah, I think."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"- It's a fun hang."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"(laughing)"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"- Definitely."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"I know the type."
01:38:27;01:38:30;"And I think there's like a bit of a horseshoe theory too,"
01:38:30;01:38:31;"where sometimes like,"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"there is a place where actually the truly the most humble,"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"like actually zenned out person"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"and the most like arrogant,"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"but with like a sly smile person are kind of similar."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"- Yeah."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"- Cause they're both taking the (beep)"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"they're both honking"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"cause they're in on the cosmic joke."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"(laughing)"
01:38:48;01:38:51;"- You gotta watch out for those fake betas in the middle."
01:38:51;01:38:56;"Number three song, my year, 2002, Puddle of Mud."
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Wait, this is so crazy."
01:38:58;01:38:59;"So well."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"- This is just a great."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- This is interesting."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Jake's had so far all English,"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Bush, Stone Roses, Oasis."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"And I've had all American,"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"stained, hoobah stank, puddle of mud."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"- Nice acoustic harmonics."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"- Kind of interesting."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"- Feeling that."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"- I hate the drummers in these bands."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"- Well, is it the drummers or the drum sound?"
01:39:27;01:39:30;"- I think the drumming too."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"- They like quantize it, right?"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"So it's perfectly rhythmic, even though it's like."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"- I think so."
01:39:35;01:39:38;"- Yeah, I mean, they were getting pretty granular in this era."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"- Yes, the drumming just strikes me as incredibly"
01:39:46;01:39:50;"like technical and like penal, no feel."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"- I think they run it through a program."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"- Mathematically correct, but zero vibes."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"- I think a lot of these drummers probably came from"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"like really technical metal."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"- Yeah."
01:40:11;01:40:14;"- This song is about his desire"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"to be a good dad to his son."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"- I wonder why it's called ""Blurred""."
01:40:56;01:40:59;"- I want this to remind me of his first."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"- It reminds me of the police or something in a weird way."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"(laughing)"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"- I can totally hear that."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"- Like the verse of ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic""."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:42:05;01:42:09;"- Oh, jig number two, you got Pearl Jam ""Better Man""."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"- Not my favorite PJ song, but I'll take it."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"- This is how ""Better Man"" starts?"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"- Wow, Eddie Vedder wrote ""Better Man"" while in high school."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"- Right, I knew that."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"I think we talked about it on the show."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"- Oh yeah."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"- And he based it off of ""Save It For Later"", English beat."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"- Oh, right, right."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"- We did touch on that."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"And again, a guy having a song."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"- Right."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"- Sitting around for 10 years."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"- He says he recorded on a four track."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"I wonder if he ever released the demo."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- I would love to hear those four track tapes from Vedder."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Another like 10, 15 years."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"- Yeah."

01:55:34;01:55:37;"he started using an Arizona pop punk band,"

01:56:25;01:56:28;"Well, at least we ended on a high note."
01:56:28;01:56:31;"- Definitely. - Or at least a middle note."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"No, a high note. I'm just saying that"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"'cause the song's called ""The Middle."""
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Anyway..."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"- I followed you. - All right, thank you."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"- I got it. - Just wanna make sure"

01:56:45;01:56:46;"No, that's a great song."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"As predicted, '95, a bit stronger than 2002,"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"but maybe in a few years, we'll listen back to these things,"
01:56:52;01:56:55;"and 2002 will start to sound better and better."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"It's missing seven years of seasoning."
01:56:57;01:57:01;"I think my opinion of that era of music has calcified."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"- It's not gonna change. - Like it's carved into stone."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Well, maybe when your daughter's a bit older"
01:57:06;01:57:11;"and she's just like, ""Dad, I can't believe you missed out, man."""
01:57:11;01:57:14;"- I mean, it has been... - You thought you were listening to..."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"- It's been 20 years. - It's 20 years old."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"- It's had... - So it's due for a comeback."
01:57:18;01:57:22;"I was gonna say, it's sort of has had its time to sort of age."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"Yeah, it's kind of percolated at this point."
01:57:24;01:57:27;"- I think so. - I like the idea of Lizzie being like,"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"""Wait a second. P.O.D. was touring"
01:57:31;01:57:35;"when you were, like, fresh out of college and you missed them?"""

01:57:36;01:57:38;"""Are you telling me..."" She's like bringing up..."
01:57:38;01:57:41;"""Who was playing in Portland, Oregon?"""
01:57:41;01:57:42;"(laughing)"
01:57:42;01:57:46;"- And you didn't go. - In November of 2002, and you missed it."
01:57:46;01:57:50;"""What were you doing then, Dad? Delivering pizza for Papa John's?"""
01:57:50;01:57:52;"Maybe seeing ""Bilt-a-Spill"" or something."
01:57:52;01:57:55;"- Oh, my God. - Who?"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"The Korean boy band?"

01:58:06;01:58:08;"Anyway, that was fun."
01:58:08;01:58:11;"We should keep digging into, like, various points in our lives."
01:58:11;01:58:15;"How about the Modern Rock charts? We were each 30."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"- Interesting. 07. - Wait, are you 07?"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"- Ooh. - Not that different."
01:58:19;01:58:22;"For me, 15. I guess things were starting to change then."
01:58:22;01:58:26;"All right. Another semi-banked TC."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"We'll see you guys real soon."
