00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, final episode of 2017. On this episode Jake and I will talk"
00:08;00:13;"Starbucks, the biggest in the world. We'll also count down the greatest hits of"
00:13;00:19;"1971 and today. All that, plus a very special holiday visit from Charlie XCX."
00:19;00:29;"This is the end of this year's Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:29;00:31;"Peace."
00:37;00:43;"Those great romances You were a friend, probably"
00:43;00:49;"All my rightful chances My picture clear"
00:49;00:57;"Everything seemed so easy And so I dealt you the blow"
00:57;01:05;"One of us had to go Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying One of us is lying"
01:11;01:16;"Be the lonely man"
01:16;01:17;"What's up, Jake?"
01:17;01:20;"Hey. Smokey outside."
01:20;01:22;"Fire on the mountain, man."
01:22;01:24;"[laughs]"
01:24;01:27;"I was singing that to myself this morning."
01:27;01:33;"I've never been in a situation where I was actively monitoring a fire on the mountain."
01:33;01:35;"Yeah, it's sketchy."
01:35;01:40;"Now I'm wondering why the Grateful Dead made that reggae song."
01:40;01:43;"I wonder if that song is literally about California wildfires."
01:43;01:44;"I mean..."
01:47;01:52;"Yeah, this is not the vibe right now in Southern California."
01:52;01:54;"Not at all."
01:54;01:57;"I mean, it's a good vibe. This song is a great vibe, but..."
02:02;02:04;"Get out, man."
02:04;02:08;"Get up, get off, get out of the door"
02:08;02:09;"Oh, I guess this song makes sense."
02:09;02:10;"Yeah, get out of the..."
02:10;02:11;"It's like there's a fire coming."
02:11;02:14;"Play cold music on the firewood floor"
02:14;02:16;"Missed that one. I don't know."
02:16;02:22;"Drown in your laughter and get to the core"
02:22;02:27;"There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town"
02:27;02:28;"Uh-oh. Oh, wait, there's an arsonist?"
02:28;02:33;"Keep your hope in the water just to cool it down"
02:33;02:38;"Well, fire, fire on the mountain"
02:38;02:40;"This is my favorite Grateful Dead vibe."
02:40;02:43;"It's like Grateful Dead reg, like light reggae."
02:43;02:46;"Fire on the mountain"
02:46;02:49;"And I love that you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt right now."
02:49;02:50;"Fire on the mountain"
02:50;02:51;"I'm keeping it mellow."
02:51;02:52;"You're just like..."
02:52;02:53;"Christmas in Los Angeles, man."
02:53;02:55;"You got the cans on with the Hawaiian shirt."
02:55;02:56;"You look like a..."
02:56;02:57;"This is like real DJs."
02:57;03:00;"Yeah, you look like a morning drive-time DJ right now."
03:00;03:02;"Anyway, these fires are horrible."
03:02;03:04;"It also makes me think a little bit."
03:04;03:06;"It's kind of brutal, but it's also this weird realization"
03:06;03:09;"how one phrase that kept coming to my head,"
03:09;03:12;"I just kept thinking, ""Living in the end times."""
03:12;03:14;"All this gnarly s*** happening, and it's just like, you know,"
03:14;03:16;"it would make me feel a little better."
03:16;03:19;"I don't know if it would comfort my other loved ones,"
03:19;03:20;"but I just kind of like..."
03:20;03:23;"You have to surrender a little bit to some of this stuff."
03:23;03:24;"It's so terrible."
03:24;03:26;"It's so brutal, people losing their homes,"
03:26;03:30;"fearing that a town they love could be changed forever,"
03:30;03:32;"and just sort of living in the end times."
03:32;03:33;"And even you think about that."
03:33;03:37;"Southern California has been super dry for a long time."
03:37;03:39;"So last winter, it started raining."
03:39;03:41;"Everybody was psyched."
03:41;03:45;"But this is also a good reminder that sometimes in life,"
03:45;03:48;"you're better off just batting--"
03:48;03:50;"What's a bad batting average? 150?"
03:50;03:52;"Terrible batting average."
03:52;03:54;"I would say, yeah, batting 200."
03:54;03:56;"Sometimes it's better to just--"
03:56;03:59;"Actually, if you're batting 200, you're not going to be in the league."
03:59;04:03;"Better to be batting 250, playing decent defense."
04:03;04:06;"What's the lowest you can bat? 225?"
04:06;04:07;"Yeah, if you're like a catcher,"
04:07;04:09;"and you're like a really good defensive catcher,"
04:09;04:11;"you could get away with batting 225."
04:11;04:13;"But no one else is going to--"
04:13;04:16;"My point is sometimes it's better to bat 225"
04:16;04:17;"than just shoot up for a game,"
04:17;04:21;"and then suddenly the whole city is excited for you."
04:21;04:22;"And then next thing you know,"
04:22;04:24;"they move you up at the World Series,"
04:24;04:25;"and then you blow."
04:25;04:26;"You choke."
04:26;04:27;"My point is just--"
04:27;04:28;"Unintended consequences."
04:28;04:29;"Unintended consequence."
04:29;04:34;"And also, I was just reading a book that talked about this concept"
04:34;04:36;"called the progress trap, too."
04:36;04:38;"Well, I guess just so people understand what I'm saying."
04:38;04:41;"Basically, it's a dry cell in California."
04:41;04:43;"One wet winter, everybody's psyched."
04:43;04:49;"Suddenly these golden brown hills are looking like the Emerald Isle."
04:49;04:51;"But then it gets real dry again."
04:51;04:55;"So you have all this [bleep] that grew because of the water"
04:55;04:59;"now becomes tinder for this psychotic fire that we're dealing with."
04:59;05:02;"And anyway, it just made me think about how that's just life."
05:02;05:04;"In this book, they're talking about the progress trap,"
05:04;05:09;"which is the concept that man comes up with some great idea,"
05:09;05:12;"like the agricultural revolution of the 1950s."
05:12;05:13;"1950s?"
05:13;05:15;"The Green Revolution."
05:15;05:17;"I'm not talking about when cavemen started."
05:17;05:18;"Okay, you're talking about pesticides and all that."
05:18;05:19;"We can take it there."
05:19;05:21;"People do take it there."
05:21;05:23;"That was a tragic turn for humanity."
05:23;05:24;"You know what? That's a better example."
05:24;05:25;"Let's go all the way back."
05:25;05:30;"We're all descended from wandering tribes of people."
05:30;05:31;"Hominids."
05:31;05:35;"Hominids walk around the plains of Africa."
05:35;05:38;"And it used to be 30 to 40 people would be in your crew,"
05:38;05:41;"walk around hunting and gathering."
05:41;05:44;"And then somebody was like, ""If we post up--"""
05:44;05:45;"Grow stuff."
05:45;05:47;"""--and we start to figure out, oh, we can grow our own stuff."""
05:47;05:49;"So you start building farms."
05:49;05:51;"So at first, that seemed like a good idea."
05:51;05:52;"It's very stable."
05:52;05:54;"You can build surpluses of food."
05:54;05:57;"But long-term, good idea doesn't work."
05:57;05:59;"That's the progress paradox?"
05:59;06:01;"Yeah, the progress trap."
06:01;06:04;"So you do something that at first seems like it's going to make things more stable,"
06:04;06:05;"feed more people."
06:05;06:07;"Next thing you know, instead of 40 people,"
06:07;06:11;"you've got a little city of 300 people posted up by the farm."
06:11;06:12;"And they need food."
06:12;06:14;"And then the crops fail one year."
06:14;06:15;"Nobody knows how to hunt and gather anymore,"
06:15;06:16;"and there's too many people anyway."
06:16;06:20;"And then you take an even bigger L than you would have."
06:20;06:21;"That's capitalism, man."
06:21;06:23;"I guess it's-- well, it's not-- beyond capitalism, it's--"
06:23;06:26;"yeah, I guess it's mo money, mo problems, kind of the same thing."
06:26;06:28;"Well, yeah, it's the concept that you need to always be growing."
06:28;06:29;"Well, right."
06:29;06:33;"If the population's growing, then you have to keep growing the economy, you know."
06:33;06:34;"Yeah."
06:34;06:35;"We're just deep in at this point."
06:35;06:36;"We're just deep in."
07:00;07:02;"But seriously, I do want to send out good vibes to everybody"
07:02;07:05;"affected by natural disasters this year."
07:05;07:06;"It's horrible."
07:06;07:10;"I mean, the one thing I can say is that we're all living in the end times together."
07:10;07:12;"And hopefully we can help each other."
07:12;07:16;"And if this is it, if humanity's not going to go on,"
07:16;07:18;"or if something really gnarly is going to happen,"
07:18;07:21;"I just want to say to the other 7 billion people on the planet,"
07:21;07:24;"of all the times I could have been born,"
07:24;07:27;"it was an honor to be born at the same time as you."
07:27;07:29;"And I'm talking about the Time Crisis listeners."
07:29;07:33;"I'm talking about Jake, Mr. Ed Sheeran."
07:33;07:36;"I'm talking about Metro Boomin."
07:36;07:38;"The two guys from the Chainsmokers."
07:38;07:40;"Two guys from the Chainsmokers,"
07:40;07:44;"who are just some great people who were alive at the same time."
07:44;07:45;"Nelson Mandela."
07:45;07:46;"Jerry."
07:46;07:47;"Jerry Garcia."
07:47;07:51;"I caught a solid 11 years on the planet with him."
07:51;07:56;"Speaking of capitalism and this need to just keep growing"
07:56;08:00;"in the face of overwhelming evidence that there's too many of us"
08:00;08:03;"and that we're all acting like f***ing ding-dongs,"
08:03;08:07;"things keep getting bigger, such as the world's biggest Starbucks."
08:07;08:11;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
08:11;08:13;"Let's talk about it."
08:13;08:18;"Starbucks opened the biggest Starbucks ever."
08:18;08:19;"And guess where?"
08:19;08:21;"I know. China."
08:21;08:22;"China."
08:22;08:24;"Let's say China."
08:24;08:25;"China."
08:25;08:27;"I'm almost glad it's not in America."
08:27;08:29;"America's played out, dog."
08:29;08:30;"It's so played out."
08:30;08:32;"It's like we're saturated."
08:32;08:34;"Where would you open the biggest Starbucks?"
08:34;08:36;"I guess like Times Square or something stupid like that."
08:36;08:38;"Mall of America."
08:38;08:39;"You know what?"
08:39;08:41;"If Starbucks really cared about America,"
08:41;08:44;"they would open it in like Buffalo."
08:44;08:45;"Right."
08:45;08:47;"Make it like a tourist attraction."
08:47;08:48;"You know what?"
08:48;08:49;"I challenge Starbucks."
08:49;08:53;"You're an American company, a coastal elite American company."
08:53;08:54;"Why not?"
08:54;08:56;"I mean, no disrespect to Shanghai,"
08:56;09:00;"but if you want a really big Starbucks in a rust belt town,"
09:00;09:02;"you'll have to employ at least--"
09:02;09:04;"looks like the one in Shanghai has 400 employees."
09:04;09:06;"That's 400 jobs right there."
09:06;09:07;"And you know what else?"
09:07;09:12;"Americans, we're so gaga for big stuff."
09:12;09:14;"You're going to start getting people from all over the Midwest."
09:14;09:18;"You're going to get people flying out just to go to the biggest Starbucks."
09:18;09:19;"And it shouldn't be in Times Square."
09:19;09:20;"And by the way--"
09:20;09:22;"Yeah, put it right on the interstate."
09:22;09:24;"Yeah, and by the way, in Times Square, you're not going to make any money."
09:24;09:26;"Rent is too damn high in New York."
09:26;09:33;"Youngstown, Ohio, you could buy a space to build the Starbucks for $100,000."
09:33;09:38;"30,000 square feet of like old, former rust belt, industrial,"
09:38;09:41;"like downtown, like riverfront brick property."
09:41;09:42;"Yeah."
09:42;09:43;"Put it in there, renovate it."
09:43;09:46;"Well, okay, so let's say you buy the property for $100,000."
09:46;09:47;"How much is the build-out going to be?"
09:47;09:48;"3 mil?"
09:48;09:49;"Yeah."
09:49;09:52;"You're going to make that money back in the first month"
09:52;09:54;"when everybody and their mother wants to come to the world's biggest Starbucks"
09:54;09:56;"in Youngstown, Ohio."
12:06;12:13;"Okay, but anyway, this is a flight of fancy that we just went on,"
12:13;12:16;"but the world's biggest Starbucks is not in America."
12:16;12:17;"It's in Shanghai."
12:17;12:20;"China and America are very similar in many ways,"
12:20;12:24;"so shout out to our Chinese brothers and sisters for obtaining this."
12:24;12:28;"The New York Times article about it opens by talking about a guy"
12:28;12:32;"who traveled 100 miles on a high-speed train to wait an hour for a cup of coffee."
12:32;12:33;"There you go."
12:33;12:36;"Doesn't this sound like the opening of a short story,"
12:36;12:38;"maybe like a sci-fi short story?"
12:38;12:41;"He Junwei traveled about 100 miles on a high-speed train"
12:41;12:43;"to wait an hour for a cup of coffee."
12:43;12:45;"Dystopian futurist novel."
12:45;12:48;"This really sounds like something in a creative writing class"
12:48;12:51;"or you just hear on national public radio."
12:51;12:54;"A short story by Ailin Tang."
12:54;12:58;"He Junwei traveled about 100 miles on a high-speed train"
12:58;13:01;"to wait an hour for a cup of coffee."
13:01;13:04;"He was one of hundreds of Chinese caffeine fiends"
13:04;13:07;"gathered to visit what essentially serves as a tribute"
13:07;13:10;"built by Starbucks in their honor."
13:10;13:12;"Tribute to themselves?"
13:12;13:13;"Yeah."
13:13;13:15;"Then this part starts to sound like an article."
13:15;13:18;"The American company on Wednesday opened its largest store in the world in Shanghai,"
13:18;13:22;"29,000 square foot sanctuary staffed, as I said, by 400 employees."
13:22;13:26;"The giant cafe represents the big bet it has placed on a country."
13:26;13:28;"How about a big bet on the Rust Belt, Bucks?"
13:28;13:31;"The giant cafe represents the big bet it has placed on a country"
13:31;13:33;"that until only recently much preferred tea."
13:33;13:34;"That's cool."
13:34;13:35;"That's a heavy transition."
13:35;13:39;"If the historical tastes of a billion people"
13:39;13:42;"have to be veered towards coffee"
13:42;13:44;"to grow the Starbucks empire, I say do it."
13:44;13:46;"Dang it, sir."
13:46;13:47;"I wonder if Starbucks--"
13:47;13:48;"I will do it."
13:48;13:52;"I wonder if Starbucks is like doing some gnarly advertising in China"
13:52;13:55;"that's just like, ""How's that tea, Grandpa?"
13:55;13:59;"Come wait in line for an hour, drink coffee."""
13:59;14:01;"I've always preferred coffee over tea,"
14:01;14:04;"but I've always respected the choices of people who prefer tea."
14:04;14:07;"So anyway, Starbucks already has 3,000 stores in China."
14:07;14:09;"That's amazing."
14:09;14:11;"And it plans to have 5,000 in four years."
14:11;14:16;"The company said it opens a store in the country"
14:16;14:19;"at a rate of one every 15 hours."
14:19;14:21;"World's biggest Starbucks in Shanghai."
14:21;14:23;"So I was talking about this with you,"
14:23;14:29;"and it made you think of a guy you'd read about back in the day named Winter."
14:29;14:32;"Yeah, I emailed with him in 2004."
14:32;14:33;"I looked it up."
14:33;14:39;"It's this guy named Winter who runs a website called starbuckseverywhere.net."
14:39;14:42;"And so I found his site maybe '03, '04,"
14:42;14:47;"when I was really getting deep on researching American chains."
14:47;14:50;"And so we emailed once or twice back then."
14:50;14:57;"And basically his vibe back in 2003, 2004 was to travel all around the U.S."
14:57;14:59;"to as many Starbucks as he possibly could,"
14:59;15:03;"go in, get a cup of coffee, and then photograph the exterior."
15:03;15:09;"And on his website, he had this huge gallery of all these exterior shots of Starbucks."
15:09;15:12;"I think I asked him if I could maybe use some of his photos to paint from."
15:12;15:14;"And he said, ""Yeah, yeah, go for it."""
15:14;15:16;"And then, you know, that was years ago."
15:16;15:19;"And then he just popped into my head the other day."
15:19;15:20;"Check it out. He's still on his journey."
15:20;15:23;"He's still doing it. He's been doing it since '97."
15:23;15:27;"So he's been on the road for 20 years all around the world."
15:27;15:30;"Yeah, it's not just the U.S. He's at many Starbucks."
15:30;15:35;"Although, I mean, he would have to basically move to China if he wanted to hit everyone."
15:35;15:37;"He's going to have to do a residency there."
15:37;15:38;"Yeah."
15:38;15:43;"He's visited at this point over 14,000 different locations of Starbucks."
15:43;15:45;"Unreal. 14,000."
15:45;15:47;"I can't believe he's still doing it."
15:47;15:48;"And he calls it ""Starbucksing."""
15:48;15:49;"Right."
15:49;15:50;"That could be a trend, too."
15:50;15:54;"Once the Youngstown biggest Starbucks in the world opens,"
15:54;15:57;"people hit the road like winter and want to check it out."
15:57;15:59;"And I can just picture, like, the news report."
15:59;16:01;"It's called ""Starbucksing."""
16:01;16:06;"Bus loads of teens from Beverly Hills, Miami Beach, and the Upper East Side"
16:06;16:11;"rent a luxury Jitney and hit the road for two weeks."
16:11;16:15;"Reminiscent of the Deadheads."
16:15;16:18;"They crisscross the country all summer long."
16:18;16:26;"Reminiscent of Jack Kerouac and the Beats on the road trying to see big old America."
16:31;16:33;"Riders on the Storm."
16:33;16:38;"Into this house we're born."
16:38;16:42;"Into this world we're thrown."
16:42;16:50;"Like a dog without a bone and Hector out of loan."
16:50;16:51;"Riders on the Storm."
16:51;16:58;"There's a killer on the road."
16:58;17:04;"His brain is squirming like a toad."
17:04;17:05;"Take a long holiday."
17:05;17:10;"Let your children play."
17:10;17:18;"If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die."
17:18;17:21;"Killer on the road."
17:21;17:21;"Yeah."
17:46;17:48;"Anyway, we've got to talk to Winter,"
17:48;17:49;"because that's amazing."
17:49;17:50;"14,000 Starbucks."
17:50;17:53;"We got to-- I don't know what his philosophy is either."
17:53;17:53;"He's--"
17:53;17:54;"We know-- he's very mysterious."
17:54;17:56;"We know very little of him."
17:56;17:58;"There's no philosophical statement on,"
17:58;18:03;"I think the homogenization of the landscape is terrible,"
18:03;18:05;"or I think Starbucks is great."
18:05;18:06;"It's just sort of he's doing it."
18:06;18:07;"It's very oblique."
18:07;18:09;"I like that, which is kind of refreshing."
18:09;18:09;"Yeah."
18:09;18:09;"Because that's--"
18:09;18:11;"It's not like an art project, I don't think."
18:11;18:12;"It's old school."
18:12;18:14;"It's like today if somebody started an Instagram,"
18:14;18:17;"and they're just like, hey, what's up, gang?"
18:17;18:19;"My name's Ezra, and I'm trying to hit every Starbucks"
18:19;18:19;"in America."
18:19;18:21;"Follow my journey on YouTube."
18:21;18:23;"Don't forget to subscribe."
18:23;18:25;"It would be like this whack thing."
18:25;18:25;"Right."
18:25;18:27;"Or on the flip side, it would be like,"
18:27;18:30;"I'm a recent art school grad living in Bushwick,"
18:30;18:32;"and just like, you know, contributed my Kickstarter"
18:32;18:33;"so I can go to every Starbucks."
18:33;18:34;"Whatever."
18:34;18:36;"He's just doing it."
18:36;18:37;"Right, he's just doing it."
18:37;18:38;"Maybe we'll find out."
18:38;18:39;"Let's get him on the line."
18:39;18:42;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
18:42;18:46;"[PHONE RINGING]"
18:46;18:47;"Good afternoon."
18:47;18:48;"This is Winter."
18:48;18:49;"Winter, how are you doing?"
18:49;18:51;"This is Ezra and Jake on Time Crisis."
18:51;18:54;"Hey, is this Ezra from Vampire Weekend?"
18:54;18:57;"Yes, I'm also known for Vampire Weekend."
18:57;18:57;"Awesome."
18:57;19:02;"I'm sorry that I missed you guys at 2013 South by."
19:02;19:05;"I was there, but I couldn't quite make it to your show."
19:05;19:06;"Oh, well, next year we'll be on tour."
19:06;19:08;"Any show you want to come to, I got you."
19:08;19:09;"Stay in touch."
19:09;19:10;"Awesome."
19:10;19:11;"Well, so we were just talking, Winter,"
19:11;19:15;"about how the world's biggest Starbucks opened in Shanghai."
19:15;19:17;"I'm sure you're aware of this."
19:17;19:20;"Yeah, everybody's posted that to my Facebook."
19:20;19:22;"It made us think about you, because Jake--"
19:22;19:23;"Hey, Winter, this is Jake."
19:23;19:24;"Hey, Jake."
19:24;19:26;"So Jake's been following you for a long time."
19:26;19:28;"So we just have a lot of questions, man."
19:28;19:32;"I mean, so first of all, you've been to 14,000 Starbucks."
19:32;19:33;"Is that about right?"
19:33;19:35;"14,000 and counting, yep."
19:35;19:36;"So how did this start?"
19:36;19:41;"Random conversation at a Starbucks in Plano, Texas."
19:41;19:43;"Just talking about the growth in the area,"
19:43;19:45;"I started to wonder, would it be possible to visit"
19:45;19:47;"all the stores?"
19:47;19:49;"Next thing you know, I was driving out to the West Coast."
19:49;19:53;"And I fell in love with seeing all the stores,"
19:53;19:55;"but in large part with the travel."
19:55;19:57;"That's one of the key things that I"
19:57;19:59;"enjoy about this whole project."
19:59;20:02;"Beyond all else, it just allows you to see other places."
20:02;20:05;"You can see every shopping center in America."
20:05;20:09;"Yes, and if you go out to Asia, shopping center culture"
20:09;20:10;"is amazing."
20:10;20:13;"I mean, malls in America are so boring compared"
20:13;20:15;"to some of the malls that you'll see in the Middle East"
20:15;20:16;"or in Asia."
20:16;20:18;"Wow, so you've really been all over the place"
20:18;20:19;"going to these Starbucks."
20:19;20:23;"So for you, what makes it an official Starbucks visit?"
20:23;20:27;"Does it count if you, say, just get a snack,"
20:27;20:30;"use the restroom, step foot in, or do"
20:30;20:31;"you have to get a beverage?"
20:31;20:32;"What counts for you?"
20:32;20:38;"Number one rule, caffeinated coffee beverage."
20:38;20:41;"Not tea, not water, not a fruity frappuccino."
20:41;20:43;"It has to be caffeinated coffee beverage."
20:43;20:45;"It has to be at least a sample."
20:45;20:48;"You've probably seen those little four ounce sample"
20:48;20:49;"slash espresso cups."
20:49;20:51;"That's what I have to drink."
20:51;20:56;"And it has to be a store that is either operated by Starbucks"
20:56;21:01;"or their exclusive partner in whatever country they are."
21:01;21:02;"So what's your go-to drink?"
21:02;21:04;"You said it's got to be caffeinated."
21:04;21:07;"Yeah, my go-to drink is just regular coffee"
21:07;21:10;"for the simple reason that 90%, 95% of the stores,"
21:10;21:13;"I can walk in, explain what I'm doing,"
21:13;21:15;"and they'll just give me a little sample."
21:15;21:16;"If I were asking for something fancier,"
21:16;21:18;"then I wouldn't be able to get it for free."
21:18;21:22;"And when you consider that overseas, a coffee could cost--"
21:22;21:25;"just a basic coffee could cost $4."
21:25;21:27;"And multiply that with how many stores I've been to,"
21:27;21:28;"that's a lot of money."
21:28;21:31;"So how many stores have you visited in one day?"
21:31;21:35;"My greatest number is 29 stores."
21:35;21:39;"And that is actually documented in a 2007 documentary"
21:39;21:41;"called ""Starbucking."""
21:41;21:41;"Whoa."
21:41;21:42;"You've got to watch that."
21:42;21:45;"So you can take down a lot of coffee in a day?"
21:45;21:47;"Or were you like-- was your heart pounding"
21:47;21:48;"at the end of that day?"
21:48;21:49;"That was a miserable day."
21:49;21:53;"I started, I think, between 5 and 5:30 AM at my first store."
21:53;21:56;"And I think I went until 9 PM."
21:56;21:59;"And I tried to space out the coffee with food and lots"
21:59;22:02;"and lots of water, just to keep it from hitting me so hard."
22:02;22:04;"But I was still pretty miserable."
22:04;22:07;"You could see it in the movie, just how bad I felt."
22:07;22:10;"And I barely slept that night."
22:10;22:11;"Good lord."
22:11;22:12;"Where were you?"
22:12;22:15;"Southern California was pretty much the only place"
22:15;22:17;"that I could have hit that goal."
22:17;22:21;"Back in the mid-2000s, they were opening probably 10 stores"
22:21;22:23;"in California every week."
22:23;22:25;"They haven't quite gotten to that point yet again."
22:25;22:30;"But they are on track to open up a lot of stores in California"
22:30;22:30;"again."
22:30;22:35;"I just cleared out the entire state as of May."
22:35;22:38;"And now there's over 100 stores out in California for me to see."
22:38;22:39;"Wow."
22:39;22:40;"Since May?"
22:40;22:41;"Yes."
22:41;22:43;"God, I would think they'd be slowing down at this point,"
22:43;22:46;"like hitting some sort of saturation level."
22:46;22:49;"No, they're finding new blocks to put them in."
22:49;22:50;"And here's the other thing that's"
22:50;22:52;"making it a nightmare for me."
22:52;22:55;"They're moving the old stores."
22:55;22:58;"All of those original stores that didn't have drive-thru"
22:58;23:01;"locations, they're slowly moving them into new buildings."
23:01;23:03;"So I need to go back and see those again."
23:03;23:06;"And now they're already up over 500 stores"
23:06;23:08;"that have relocated in the past five years."
23:08;23:10;"So it's just like across the street or something."
23:10;23:12;"And now you've got to go back."
23:12;23:12;"Yeah."
23:12;23:16;"And I expect that this is going to continue maybe"
23:16;23:19;"for the next decade until all those old stores, when"
23:19;23:23;"their leases expire, get a chance to have drive-thrus."
23:23;23:25;"Because that's where the money's at, drive-thrus."
23:25;23:26;"Ah."
23:26;23:27;"[MUSIC - BAD BOYS, ""DRIVE THRU""]"
23:29;23:31;"Going to the drill up with the AP, yeah."
23:31;23:34;"Sliding on the water like a jet ski, yeah."
23:34;23:36;"I'm trying to fuck you on your bestie, yeah."
23:36;23:39;"Chop it with the skull, so do not test me, yeah."
23:39;23:41;"With the flare drip, go woo on it, boo."
23:41;23:43;"'57, '90s, spent the coupe on my wrist."
23:43;23:46;"Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits."
23:46;23:48;"Hop up in the limo and drop the roof, so the--"
23:48;23:50;"Hopping, but you really not going to shoot."
23:50;23:52;"90 pointers, diamond, look like hula hoops."
23:52;23:55;"Hopping, mopping, taking in the status of my suits."
23:55;23:58;"Felicia, y'all go check my purse and Valentino boots."
23:58;24:00;"It's the booming out of way, a lot of limo, a lot of racks."
24:00;24:02;"Never hesitate to give a yellow tape."
24:02;24:05;"And worry about the bag, 'cause the cash accumulate."
24:05;24:07;"Soon as we came in the game, all these niggas imitated."
24:07;24:10;"Put my mind on it, then I put my grind on it."
24:10;24:12;"Put the iron on them, if they're wigging my opponent."
24:12;24:14;"My cold fire, hunnid on, put no miles on it."
24:14;24:17;"I was running wild, homie, with 500,000 on me."
24:17;24:19;"Going to the drill up, bust the AP, yeah."
24:19;24:22;"Sliding on the water like a jet ski, yeah."
24:22;24:24;"I'm trying to fuck you on your bestie, yeah."
24:24;24:27;"Chop it with the skull, so do not test me, yeah."
24:27;24:29;"With the flare drip, go woo on it, boo."
24:29;24:31;"'57, '90s, spent the coupe on my wrist."
24:31;24:34;"Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits."
24:34;24:36;"Hop up in the limo and drop the roof, so the--"
24:36;24:39;"Tore my finger, got the gang with me."
24:39;24:41;"Bought my paper ticket, got some brain on it."
24:41;24:43;"We used to kick it, how you hang on me?"
24:43;24:46;"Hop in the Bentley coupe and blow the brains out."
24:46;24:47;"We're not the same, honey."
24:47;24:49;"We funding off division."
24:49;24:51;"And with your brain, yeah, we vouching like it's a auction."
24:51;24:54;"Be the chopper, hunnid round total, like it's a car collision."
24:54;24:56;"I made it to your man, then told the millions I had to get it."
24:56;24:58;"My shooter be begging, please, you ready to whack him?"
24:58;25:01;"I gave him a diamond, I had to cap it."
25:01;25:03;"I'm giving your home away, like she a rapper."
25:03;25:05;"We get added, then we go play with the plastic stretchers."
25:05;25:07;"Go to the jeweler, bust an AP, yeah."
25:07;25:10;"Sliding on the water like a jet ski, yeah."
25:10;25:12;"I'm trying to [MUTED] you in your bestie, yeah."
25:12;25:15;"Chopper with the skull, so do not test me, yeah."
25:15;25:17;"Quick flood drip, go woo on it, boo."
25:17;25:19;"5790, split the coupe on my wrist."
25:19;25:22;"Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits."
25:22;25:24;"Hop up in the limo and drop the roof, so the--"
25:24;25:27;"Go into the jeweler, bust an AP, yeah."
25:27;25:29;"Sliding on the water like a jet ski, yeah."
25:29;25:31;"I'm trying to [MUTED] you in your bestie, yeah."
25:31;25:34;"Chopper with the skull, so do not test me, yeah."
25:34;25:36;"Quick flood drip, go woo on it, boo."
25:36;25:39;"5790, split the coupe on my wrist."
25:39;25:41;"Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits."
25:41;25:44;"Hop up in the limo and drop the roof, so the--"
25:44;25:45;"We were looking at your website, and we"
25:45;25:48;"see that you're not just Starbucksing these days."
25:48;25:51;"You're also interested in what's called third wave coffee."
25:51;25:54;"Can you explain what third wave coffee is to the listeners?"
25:54;25:58;"So the first wave was that crappy Folgers Maxwell House"
25:58;26:02;"coffee that you would get pretty much anywhere in the '60s."
26:02;26:06;"Then Starbucks came along and raised the bar for coffee"
26:06;26:09;"by buying the higher quality Arabica beans."
26:09;26:13;"And they were really, really good for a few decades."
26:13;26:15;"And they were the best thing that you could get in a given"
26:15;26:17;"city for quite a while."
26:17;26:19;"Then at some point, maybe in the '90s,"
26:19;26:23;"this third wave came along of roasters"
26:23;26:25;"that started putting a lot of effort"
26:25;26:28;"into sourcing really high quality beans,"
26:28;26:31;"roasting them much lighter than Starbucks does,"
26:31;26:34;"and experimenting with brewing methods that really bring out"
26:34;26:35;"the flavor."
26:35;26:37;"And those are the coffee shops that I've"
26:37;26:41;"been focusing on over the past seven years"
26:41;26:43;"while still trying to keep up with Starbucks."
26:43;26:47;"Would this count like your Blue Bottles, your Stumptowns?"
26:47;26:49;"Yeah, it's actually Stumptown was"
26:49;26:54;"the very first independent coffee house that I went to."
26:54;26:55;"And because I was out on the West Coast,"
26:55;26:58;"I discovered Blue Bottle not long after that."
26:58;27:01;"So your Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Intelligentsia,"
27:01;27:04;"Counterculture, although I actually"
27:04;27:07;"prefer the better flavors that you get from even smaller"
27:07;27:09;"roasters that you've never heard of,"
27:09;27:13;"like Kickapoo Coffee out of Wisconsin, for example."
27:13;27:15;"Shout out to Kickapoo out in Wisconsin."
27:15;27:18;"So clearly, you have a lot of respect for the Starbucks chain."
27:18;27:19;"Is that fair to say?"
27:19;27:20;"That is correct."
27:20;27:23;"They are amazing at customer service."
27:23;27:26;"And that's one reason that if you travel to Qatar,"
27:26;27:30;"for example, and you just need a place to go get some coffee,"
27:30;27:32;"get some work done, get some Wi-Fi,"
27:32;27:34;"you know that you can count on that at Starbucks."
27:34;27:37;"Whether as if you go to some local chain or some local shop,"
27:37;27:39;"you don't know what you're getting."
27:39;27:41;"Do you ever feel like you have a love-hate relationship"
27:41;27:42;"with the chain?"
27:42;27:44;"Because as much as you love the coffee and the customer"
27:44;27:48;"service, just the fact that you're almost in a race"
27:48;27:51;"with them, you're hearing, oh, they move that low-key."
27:51;27:53;"Is there anything that frustrates you about Starbucks"
27:53;27:55;"or Starbucking?"
27:55;27:57;"I wouldn't say it's a love-hate relationship."
27:57;28:00;"But the fact that they're moving around all these stores,"
28:00;28:03;"that is quite a bit frustrating."
28:03;28:05;"They have a lot of issues with the website,"
28:05;28:07;"probably because they're opening up so many stores."
28:07;28:11;"Getting the listings up to date is a little frustrating."
28:11;28:12;"But I don't hate them in any way."
28:12;28:15;"I respect what they've been able to do."
28:15;28:18;"I just try to keep it in perspective."
28:18;28:21;"They are not, first and foremost, a coffee company."
28:21;28:24;"I think they are a customer service company."
28:24;28:26;"I would imagine that most customers--"
28:26;28:27;"I don't want to speak for them."
28:27;28:29;"But I would imagine that most customers aren't going there"
28:29;28:31;"because they think they're going to get the best"
28:31;28:33;"cup of coffee in the world."
28:33;28:36;"And that's where the third wave has sprung up."
28:36;28:38;"And that is something that Starbucks"
28:38;28:42;"is pushing back against with their reserve bars."
28:42;28:44;"Right, we've heard about these reserves."
28:44;28:45;"Yeah, that's an interesting concept."
28:45;28:47;"And their roasteries."
28:47;28:50;"I've been to most of the reserve bars that are currently"
28:50;28:51;"open in North America."
28:51;28:54;"I'm hoping to get to the other ones next year."
28:54;28:57;"And those are really fascinating locations,"
28:57;29:00;"if you ever get a chance to see one, as well as the roasteries."
29:00;29:04;"That Seattle roastery is an amazing space."
29:04;29:07;"And I cannot wait for the Manhattan one to open next year,"
29:07;29:10;"Chicago one in 2019."
29:10;29:12;"And then, of course, if I can get to Shanghai next year,"
29:12;29:14;"I am definitely going to try."
29:14;29:16;"Do you feel any type of way about the fact"
29:16;29:19;"that Starbucks, an American company,"
29:19;29:21;"didn't choose to open the biggest Starbucks in the world"
29:21;29:22;"in America?"
29:22;29:24;"Because Jake and I were talking about how cool"
29:24;29:26;"it would be if they went to a Rust Belt town"
29:26;29:29;"and maybe opened the biggest Starbucks in the world"
29:29;29:32;"to try to get some press for one of these more forgotten cities"
29:32;29:34;"where industry has moved away."
29:34;29:36;"That is a fascinating question."
29:36;29:38;"They could have taken that opportunity."
29:38;29:41;"But if you keep reading a lot about Starbucks,"
29:41;29:46;"they make no mistake that Asia, and China specifically,"
29:46;29:49;"is going to be one of their top markets moving forward."
29:49;29:51;"So I think that this move in Shanghai"
29:51;29:58;"was a nod to the fact that Asia is such an important location."
29:58;29:59;"But I agree with you."
29:59;30:01;"And I actually just blogged about this a couple of months"
30:01;30:06;"ago at a place called New Order Coffee in Detroit."
30:06;30:08;"I blogged that Starbucks has pretty much"
30:08;30:11;"abandoned the city of Detroit."
30:11;30:16;"There are only two company-owned Starbucks"
30:16;30:17;"in that city."
30:17;30:18;"In the whole city of Detroit?"
30:18;30:21;"In the whole city of Detroit, city limit,"
30:21;30:23;"all the way up to eight mile."
30:23;30:25;"And to put that in perspective, New York"
30:25;30:27;"has thousands and thousands, right?"
30:27;30:28;"Yeah, yeah."
30:28;30:30;"But what I was blogging about, I was"
30:30;30:32;"glad that some of these independent roasters,"
30:32;30:37;"like New Order, were willing to get in there and give Detroit"
30:37;30:37;"a chance."
30:37;30:42;"And I wish that Starbucks would give Detroit more of a chance."
30:42;30:44;"Well, maybe they're leaving more room."
30:44;30:46;"Yeah, if they had built a roastery there,"
30:46;30:49;"that would have been a real coup for the city of Detroit."
30:49;30:51;"Well, this has been very interesting, Wynter."
30:51;30:53;"We hope you'll call in again, because obviously it's"
30:53;30:54;"an ongoing project."
30:54;30:56;"And we'd love to check in with you again in the future."
30:56;30:57;"Anytime, anytime."
30:57;30:58;"Really appreciate it."
30:58;30:59;"Thanks, man."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"So you don't have particularly fond memories,"
01:30:27;01:30:30;"because like you're out in LA most of the time, right?"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Yes."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"Yeah, me too."
01:30:32;01:30:33;"And given that we're from--"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"you know, also, you know what's even funny is that in New Jersey,"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"the county that I'm from is called Essex County."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Wow."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"So there's a lot in common."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"OK."
01:30:40;01:30:43;"But we're both from kind of cold, suburban places."
01:30:43;01:30:47;"When you're out here, and it's just burning hot,"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"and everything's on fire around Christmas,"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"do you have like a soft spot where you're just kind of like,"
01:30:52;01:30:57;"oh, I kind of miss like a cold Essex Christmas?"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Yeah, I do."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"I mean, because I grew up in--"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"you know, with cold Christmases."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"Yeah."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"It's weird when it's so hot."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"It doesn't-- it feels like a very normal--"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"like it doesn't feel like Christmas."
01:31:08;01:31:12;"But I don't love Christmas, so that is kind of a bonus for me,"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"you know?"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"So what would you be doing on Christmas when you were like"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"living in your parents' house?"
01:31:18;01:31:22;"Just the classic family stuff, you know?"
01:31:22;01:31:26;"Wake up, like eat breakfast, do the presents,"
01:31:26;01:31:29;"all the extended family come round."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"It's probably a board game."
01:31:31;01:31:35;"Like, then they all go, and then we all go to sleep."
01:31:35;01:31:38;"It's like not super eventful, but that's basically how it goes."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"And you just felt like you were being forced--"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"you couldn't be yourself or something,"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"because everybody's acting so cheery?"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't really that."
01:31:46;01:31:49;"It was more just-- I just--"
01:31:49;01:31:53;"I'm not good with, like, the mass social interaction thing"
01:31:53;01:31:57;"and the small talk, and then it's like offset to a backdrop"
01:31:57;01:32:00;"of, like, Christmas songs, movies."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"There's no options at Christmas."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"Like, you have to only be, like, really into Christmas."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"It would be weird to tell your family--"
01:32:06;01:32:09;"Everyone's nodding, like, in a really serious--"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"everyone's like, ""Yeah, we understand."""
01:32:10;01:32:11;"It's very serious."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"It is."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Yeah."
01:32:13;01:32:15;"It would be weird to-- also in, like, other holidays,"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"like Halloween, there's, like, a lot of different things going on."
01:32:17;01:32:20;"You can choose what you want to, whereas with Christmas--"
01:32:20;01:32:23;"I don't know this because I'm not a Christian,"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"but on Christmas, from what I understand,"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"there's kind of one game in town,"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"and that's your family's Christmas."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"It'd be weird if you said, ""I'm going to go to a friend's house."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"""I'm going to just jump in the car for 20"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"""to hit that McDonald's by Stansted."""
01:32:36;01:32:39;"There's an expectation that you're--"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"that you have to be present."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"Yeah."

01:36:14;01:36:17;"I feel like you've been working on an album for a long time."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"Yeah."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"And you got a mixtape coming out today."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"Two days ago, but..."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"You got a mixtape coming out two days ago."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"Yeah."
01:36:24;01:36:28;"So watch out for that in the past."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"I've been working on an album so long, I can't--"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"I don't know heads from tails anymore."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"I'm sick of working on the same [bleep]"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"So I always fantasize in this phase of the process"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"about other things I could do with my life."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Yeah."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Are you like that?"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Yeah, I have a couple of things."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"One that's pretty high up is ice skating."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Oh, really?"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"Yeah, I'm not that good."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"I can go and have fun and not fall."
01:36:54;01:36:59;"But I think it would be pretty cool to go pro."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"The outfits are good."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"Yeah."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"The whole thing is pretty beautiful."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"It's kind of trending up."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"There's that new movie about Tonya Harding everybody likes."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"Right."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"I haven't seen it."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Apparently it's great."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"But let's keep it real."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"You like ice skating."
01:37:13;01:37:17;"Because would you actually ever consider in the coming years--"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"It's hard to--"
01:37:18;01:37:19;"How old are you?"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"25."
01:37:21;01:37:24;"So I think you're supposed to start when you're 7."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"But certainly before 30."
01:37:26;01:37:31;"Would you ever consider going for it just almost in this kind of like--"
01:37:31;01:37:36;"It's a Sisyphean task to try to go pro at a sport from 25."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"But you know Redfoo?"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Do I? Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"LMFAO, right?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"You guys ever work together?"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"No, but my manager is like a huge fan of his."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"So do you know the story about Redfoo?"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Tell me."
01:37:46;01:37:50;"I heard this like fifth hand, so I'm probably getting this totally wrong."
01:37:50;01:37:52;"But I did meet him once."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"Or no, I saw him once."
01:37:54;01:37:58;"Me and CT on tour went to the Australian Open where infamously--"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"Oh."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"I sat next to Kevin Spacey, which I don't want to talk about."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"But let's just say it was weird."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"And elsewhere was Redfoo."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"So of course--"
01:38:07;01:38:08;"I don't know who that is."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"Well, he was in the LMFAO."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Okay."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"You know, I work out."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Right, okay."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Huge."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Major pop star."
01:38:15;01:38:17;"So he was there, and he has this giant fro."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"He's very recognizable."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"So he's there."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"It's like so random."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"We're in Australia, and Kevin Spacey's there, and then Redfoo's there."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"And he's like yelling."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"You're supposed to be quiet at tennis matches."
01:38:25;01:38:28;"So he's yelling, and then like slowly somebody explains to us like--"
01:38:28;01:38:29;"We were watching the women's finals."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"I forget what her name was."
01:38:30;01:38:31;"We were like, that's his girlfriend."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"And we were like, oh, that's pretty cool."
01:38:33;01:38:37;"So anyway, I was telling somebody that story a couple years later, and they're like,"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"oh, you know, he got really into tennis."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"And I was like, oh, I guess that makes sense."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"You date somebody who's into a sport."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"You get into it."
01:38:44;01:38:47;"And they're like, no, no, that's what he's been doing post-LMFAO."
01:38:47;01:38:54;"And Redfoo, if I'm getting the story wrong, I mean, I admire it, but please correct us."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"And they said, no, he got into tennis."
01:38:56;01:38:59;"He was so inspired by watching his-- and she won the Australian Open."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"She's a serious tennis player."
01:39:01;01:39:05;"He was so inspired by that, and he got so into the sport that after LMFAO broke up--"
01:39:05;01:39:11;"and I'm sure he was sitting on a heap of cash after all those hits in a row--"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"that he just started really training."
01:39:13;01:39:17;"And not just like an old guy gets into tennis, and he's like, oh, yeah, I hit a round every day."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"He wanted to go pro."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"So he was probably like 30 or something."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"He got a serious coach."
01:39:22;01:39:26;"He started investing his own money to get on the kind of lower circuit."
01:39:26;01:39:30;"And I think-- I don't know if he ever cracked more than the top 500 in the world."
01:39:30;01:39:38;"Because once you get outside of the top 50 in tennis, you're basically losing money every time you go to a tournament or something."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"Full-time coach."
01:39:39;01:39:42;"But he took it seriously, at least for a couple years, and he was really going for it."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"I'm sexy and I know it."
01:39:44;01:39:49;"I think about this a lot too, how we live in a culture, I think especially as musicians,"
01:39:49;01:39:54;"where everybody's always saying like if you put out a mixtape and it sounds just like the last one,"
01:39:54;01:39:58;"people are going to be like, well, it's good, but it's just like the last one."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"There's this pressure to innovate, take risks, right?"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"And so people are like, you've got to be ready to fail."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"You've got to take risks."
01:40:05;01:40:09;"Real musicians, the Beatles, Kanye, Bjork, those people took risks."
01:40:09;01:40:10;"And I always think about this."
01:40:10;01:40:14;"Well, they took very smart risks that worked perfectly."
01:40:14;01:40:17;"I'm interested in people who took risks that stupendously backfired."
01:40:17;01:40:21;"We don't talk about them because those risks were so crazy."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"You know what I mean?"
01:40:22;01:40:25;"It's one thing to be like, Charlie, you're an important artist."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"You've taken a lot of risks in your career."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"I want to see you take a big risk."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"I want your next mixtape to be all acoustic."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Wow, that's crazy."
01:40:34;01:40:35;"That's not a risk."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"I mean, it's a slight risk."
01:40:36;01:40:43;"A real risk would be like, Charlie, your next mixtape won't exist because you're taking three years off"
01:40:43;01:40:49;"to try to like investing hundreds of thousands of dollars of your own money"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"to like really pursue professional."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"And you don't even get to make a documentary about it or anything like that."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Like no content."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"No content comes from this."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Just disappear."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"No Instagram story."
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Well, you could Instagram story, but no documentary."
01:41:02;01:41:09;"You disappear for a few years and you just like just doggedly pursue this difficult goal of becoming."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"I would admire it, but the world wouldn't."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"I think."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"Oh, my God."
01:41:16;01:41:20;"Later in my sheets."
01:41:20;01:41:24;"Dancing on no sleep."
01:41:24;01:41:27;"I don't learn when I burn, when I turn all the way up."
01:41:27;01:41:31;"Yeah, I don't learn when I burn in the dirt till I'm out of luck."
01:41:31;01:41:36;"Yeah, pills and potions and terrible things."
01:41:36;01:41:40;"Hot on the floor when the telephone rings."
01:41:40;01:41:44;"All of the lies I just want to believe."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"Trouble my morals, I just want to sin."
01:41:47;01:41:50;"I'm out of my, out of my head."
01:41:50;01:41:54;"Please get out of my, out of my, out of my head."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"Please get out of my, out of my, out of my head."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Out of my head."
01:42:03;01:42:07;"Yeah."
01:42:07;01:42:11;"Beed you, bead you, bead you out."
01:42:11;01:42:15;"Party with my tears."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"Swaying with my fears."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"Let them try to get me high."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"I'll get by if I get enough."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"Yeah."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Let them try to get me high."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"I'll get by with a little love."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"I know I'll get mad."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"Pills and potions and terrible things."
01:42:33;01:42:37;"Hot on the floor when the telephone rings."
01:42:37;01:42:42;"All of the lies I just want to believe."
01:42:42;01:42:45;"Trouble my morals, I just want to sin."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"I'm out of my, out of my head."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"Out of my head."
01:42:48;01:42:52;"Please get out of my, out of my, out of my head."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"Out of my head."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"I'm out of my, out of my head."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"Out of my head."

01:43:07;01:43:08;"Out of my head."
01:43:08;01:43:11;"Please get out of my, out of my, out of my head."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Out of my head."
01:43:12;01:43:15;"Please get out of my, out of my, out of my head."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"Out of my head."

01:44:59;01:45:03;"- You're listening to a very time crisis holiday special."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"- Do you think you would ever leave music entirely?"
01:45:04;01:45:05;"Has that ever crossed your mind?"
01:45:05;01:45:08;"- Of course, I think it crosses a lot of people's minds,"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"right?"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"- Yeah, every day."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"I mean, when you're doing something that's not fun,"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"like finishing an album."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- Right, yeah."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"- Hopefully you're not thinking about it"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"when you're like on stage."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"- On stage, like, oh, I wish I could just leave this."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"- Yeah, but when you're doing like the hard stuff"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"where like you're on, you're sitting at--"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"- Promo."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"- Yeah, you're sitting at like a, you know, an airport,"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"doesn't even have a Starbucks,"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"and you're just like, why am I here?"
01:45:29;01:45:30;"- Sure."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"- What would you do, both of you?"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"- Would you take a couple years to do the ice skating thing?"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"- No, no."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Realistically, no."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"I would do it for like fun for a week,"
01:45:39;01:45:42;"but I'm not gonna do two years."
01:45:42;01:45:47;"I think I would probably do something kind of music related."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Does that count?"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Is that allowed?"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"Is that leaving?"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Like, what would you know?"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"I'd just write songs for other people."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"Does that count?"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"- You've been done that."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"- That doesn't count."
01:45:55;01:45:56;"- Okay, that doesn't count."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Then I don't know."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"I'd really have to think about it."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"Maybe something to do with interior design."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"That could be fun."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"- Okay."
01:46:03;01:46:04;"- I like that."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"- Yeah."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"You've been to my house, I think."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"- I went to your house, I think, when you just moved in."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"- You ran into a spider, I think."
01:46:10;01:46:11;"- I saw a terrifying--"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"- That was some drive drama."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"- Yeah, I saw a terrifying spider."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"- Yeah."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"- I think I still have a picture on my phone."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"This is like, I guess kind of a housewarming party."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"You had gorgeous home."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"- No furniture, though, I don't think."
01:46:23;01:46:23;"- Very little furniture."
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Although the house is, it's kind of an old house."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"It had a lot of vibe."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And it's a very Englishy house."
01:46:28;01:46:28;"- Yeah."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"- In that kind of LA."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"- Mock Tudor."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"- Mock Tudor."
01:46:31;01:46:34;"- I'm sorry about that trauma that you experienced."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"- No, it was fine."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"- Okay, good."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"- But so you've furnished the whole house?"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"- Yeah, it's furnished."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"It's fun stuff going on in there."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"- And you go to furniture stores"
01:46:43;01:46:44;"and look at the couches and--"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"- Yeah, yeah, I had some made."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"That was fun."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"- Oh, really?"
01:46:48;01:46:48;"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
01:46:48;01:46:53;"A lot of kind of just, yeah, old secondhand stuff."
01:46:53;01:46:56;"- I mean, your house seems perfect to host a Christmas."
01:46:56;01:46:59;"Has this ever, this subject been broached?"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- No, no."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"We don't have a tree yet."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"- Right."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"- Do you have a tree up?"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"- No. - You don't do trees?"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Do you, anyone have a tree?"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"You got the tree up?"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"- What about you, Jake?"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Are you gonna do a tree?"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"- Yeah, we talked about it."
01:47:10;01:47:12;"We probably should get on it if we're gonna do it."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"- Oh, really?"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Hannah's down?"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"- Oh, yeah."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"- Jake recently married a Jewess."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- Congrats."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"- Thank you."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Very proud."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"(laughing)"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"- So you're gonna have an interfaith household?"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"- Oh, yeah."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"We've had one for a few years now."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"(laughing)"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"We just moved in after we got married."
01:47:31;01:47:36;"She was bringing that up though, as a thing we could do."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"Get a tree."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"- Get a tree."
01:47:38;01:47:39;"And would you also have a menorah?"
01:47:39;01:47:42;"- Haven't broached that yet."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"- Yeah."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"- Well, maybe."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"- So Charlie, does the religious aspect"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"of Christmas appeal to you?"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"- No, I'm not religious, so I mean--"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"- You're not consider yourself a Christian?"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"- No."
01:47:54;01:47:58;"So I don't really get too stuck in"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"with that kind of side of things."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"- So you could go the entire Christmas holiday"
01:48:03;01:48:07;"without once thinking about the three kings"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"or Jesus's birth or all that stuff?"
01:48:09;01:48:10;"- Yeah."
01:48:10;01:48:14;"My family are from India, my mom's side of the family."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"So none of them are Christian."
01:48:15;01:48:20;"So we don't really chat about the kings and stuff."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- And your dad's side is not--"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"- My dad's atheist, so he's not talking"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"about the kings either."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"So we don't chat about them that much."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"- What about you, Jake?"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"Do you chat about the kings?"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"- No."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"My family's very atheist."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Like declared."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"- Declared?"
01:48:36;01:48:37;"- Declared atheist."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Like, I remember being like 12 and being like,"
01:48:39;01:48:40;"dad, do you believe in God?"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"And I was like, nope."
01:48:43;01:48:47;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:49:00;01:49:26;"- Happy holidays from the Time Crisis Crew."
01:49:26;01:49:30;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:49:50;01:50:02;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:50:12;01:50:19;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:50:19;01:50:33;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:50:33;01:50:37;"(upbeat music continues)"

01:51:16;01:51:20;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:51:20;01:51:31;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:51:31;01:51:44;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:51:44;01:51:48;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:51:48;01:51:59;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:52:14;01:52:27;"- Beautiful."
01:52:27;01:52:31;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:52:34;01:52:46;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:52:46;01:52:49;"(upbeat music continues)"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"- Well, that was a hell of a time crisis."
01:53:16;01:53:19;"(all laughing)"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"- The year kind of flew by."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"- The whole year flew by."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"I think this might've been one of the best time crises"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"of the year, actually."
01:53:27;01:53:27;"- Top five."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- Definitely top five."
01:53:28;01:53:32;"'Cause on this episode, we had CharlieXCX and Winter,"
01:53:32;01:53:37;"the King of Starbucking, all on the same episode."
01:53:37;01:53:37;"That's pretty tight."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"Are you guys excited for 2018?"
01:53:39;01:53:40;"- Yeah."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"- What about you, Charlie?"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Excited?"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"- Yeah, sure."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Sure."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"- In the sense that life goes on"
01:53:46;01:53:50;"and that's gonna just be next month."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"- Well, I wouldn't say I'm excited, but I'm very curious."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"'Cause Jake and I were talking with all these fires"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"and all these awful things that have been happening."
01:53:56;01:53:59;"It kind of feels like we're living in the end times."
01:53:59;01:54:02;"Maybe this will be the last Christmas."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"Generally, my feeling though,"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"is that if we're moving towards the end,"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"let's just get it over with."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"You know?"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"That's my holiday message for 2017."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"- That's uplifting."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"- Let's all be kind to each other."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"It's the Christmas season."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"Whatever religion you are, let's be kind to each other."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Let's enjoy each other."
01:54:21;01:54:25;"And if this is the last Christmas/New Years,"
01:54:25;01:54:30;"you know, I think take the time"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"to tell your loved ones whatever happens to this old world."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Just imagine it's like the last day of summer camp."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- We had a hell of a run."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"- We had a hell of a run."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"It might be a tearful hug."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"It might be a fun thing."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Just like we had a great time together."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"We were listing all the people earlier"
01:54:45;01:54:48;"that we were happy were on the planet"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"at the same time as them."
01:54:50;01:54:55;"Like we got to cross over with Jerry Garcia, Obama."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"- That's really kind of it."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"- If this is it, if global warming went too far,"
01:54:58;01:55:01;"and we, you know, it kind of is what it is."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"I just want to thank everybody."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"- You're welcome."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"♪ Thank you for being a friend ♪"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"♪ Travel down the road and back again ♪"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"♪ Your heart is true ♪"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"♪ You're a pal and a confidant ♪"
01:55:18;01:55:21;"- Okay, but Time Crisis will be back"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"as long as the world keeps on turning."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"- Yep."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"- As long as, Time Crisis will be back in the new year."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"- Mid-January."
01:55:28;01:55:31;"- And we got a new Charlie XCX mixtape"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"to enjoy when we go home and see our families."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"And you have a show too."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"- This is the first crossover."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"- Oh, a Beats show."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"I thought you meant a live show."
