00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. We're joined by a very special guest, a man from the East."
00:08;00:17;"You know who it is. Despot. We also count down the top hits of 1946 and today. All that,"
00:17;00:23;"plus some Oscars talk, a dip in the mailbag, and a little sneak preview of Vampire Weekend's"
00:23;00:34;"upcoming tour. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Spotlight One."
01:20;01:26;"Time Crisis, back again. I'm joined in our Los Angeles studio by Jake as always."
01:26;01:27;"Hey."
01:27;01:32;"And a very special guest, the head of Time Crisis East, Despot."
01:32;01:33;"Hi."
01:33;01:35;"President of TC East."
01:35;01:38;"I didn't know I was the head or the president."
01:38;01:38;"Well."
01:38;01:39;"Or both."
01:39;01:40;"You just got a promotion."
01:40;01:42;"Thanks."
01:42;01:46;"It's actually really winter here for the first time I can remember."
01:46;01:50;"The whole time I've been here, raining and cold, and you guys don't know how to drive"
01:50;01:53;"when it's raining and you get scared when it's cold."
01:53;01:56;"That's kind of true. Not me."
01:56;01:59;"Yeah, well, you have a thicker skin."
01:59;02:00;"That's right."
02:00;02:01;"I barely drive."
02:01;02:06;"I'm really excited about it. I'm wearing my New York, big New York coat around town."
02:06;02:07;"It's good luck."
02:07;02:12;"Gonna have a hot coffee, almost pretend that I'm back in New York here and there."
02:12;02:13;"I'm here."
02:13;02:13;"You're here?"
02:13;02:14;"It's like you're in New York."
02:14;02:16;"I got the president of TC East here."
02:16;02:19;"You know, slowly but surely, man."
02:19;02:21;"Man, we got so much to talk about."
02:21;02:25;"It's been an absolutely jam-packed last two weeks."
02:25;02:30;"Well, one thing that you guys noted as we came in is that you're both openers"
02:30;02:33;"on the next Vampire Weekend Tour."
02:33;02:34;"That is true."
02:34;02:34;"Yeah."
02:34;02:39;"The last show, we started talking about the tour a little bit, but we didn't go that deep."
02:39;02:41;"Now the tix have been on sale for a while."
02:41;02:47;"And I can talk more specifically about the bills because with both of you guys,"
02:47;02:49;"you're not doing like full legs of the tour."
02:49;02:51;"Although that could be fun in the future."
02:51;02:51;"That'd be tight."
02:51;02:53;"Richard Pictures and Death Spot."
02:53;02:55;"You're kind of dangling the carrot here."
02:55;02:56;"Well, I know."
02:56;02:56;"Who plays first though."
02:56;02:57;"That's tough."
02:57;02:59;"Because we alternate at night to night."
02:59;03:00;"You're both busy guys."
03:00;03:02;"I mean, at least Death Spot is just one man."
03:02;03:04;"Richard Pictures is five men?"
03:04;03:06;"It's a seven person band."
03:06;03:07;"Full seven?"
03:07;03:09;"It varies from five to seven."
03:09;03:11;"By the way, all seven are in for Chicago."
03:11;03:12;"Oh really?"
03:12;03:12;"Yeah."
03:12;03:12;"Sick."
03:12;03:13;"Yeah."
03:13;03:15;"Because when you guys are the Novo."
03:15;03:16;"Oh yeah, of course."
03:16;03:16;"Yeah."
03:16;03:18;"At the Novo, that was a five man jam."
03:18;03:18;"Yeah."
03:18;03:21;"Donna and Keith were out of town."
03:21;03:26;"And you guys are a little harder to wrangle also because, well, you're not full-time musicians."
03:26;03:28;"Not a professional band."
03:28;03:29;"Right."
03:29;03:30;"It is a hobby."
03:30;03:36;"I know, but it gets confusing with the dead because you have some Grateful Dead cover bands."
03:36;03:36;"That are pro."
03:36;03:36;"Yeah."
03:36;03:38;"Like you're J-Rads."
03:38;03:39;"You're dead and ghost."
03:39;03:40;"Right."
03:40;03:41;"Who are pulling in."
03:41;03:42;"That's a full-time job."
03:42;03:44;"Some folks trust reason."
03:44;03:46;"Others trust the mind."
03:46;03:49;"I don't trust nothing."
03:49;03:52;"But I know it'll come all right."
03:52;03:54;"Say it once again now."
03:54;03:57;"Well, I hope you understand."
03:57;04:02;"When it's turning over, love matters just a man."
04:02;04:04;"Play it."
04:04;04:06;"Play it."
04:06;04:09;"Play it."
04:11;04:12;"Can't break all my love."
04:12;04:18;"Actually today I was talking with like kind of like our touring team and somebody referenced"
04:18;04:19;"the Pink Floyd light show."
04:19;04:24;"And then somebody was like, well, have you seen the Australian Pink Floyd show?"
04:24;04:25;"I was like, what is that?"
04:25;04:29;"And they're like, well, they're based in the UK, but they're a bunch of Australian guys"
04:29;04:31;"who started a Pink Floyd tribute band."
04:31;04:32;"Sounds terrible."
04:32;04:33;"Oh, you're already hating?"
04:33;04:34;"They're Australian."
04:34;04:38;"Oh, we're not hating on Australia."
04:38;04:39;"I am."
04:39;04:41;"All right, well, yeah, Despot."
04:41;04:42;"I got like three Australian friends."
04:42;04:44;"I feel like you got a lot of Australian friends."
04:44;04:45;"Three maybe."
04:45;04:50;"So it's a touring Pink Floyd cover band and light show."
04:50;04:50;"Yeah."
04:50;04:55;"And so I was talking to this touring guy and I was like, because Pink Floyd was one of"
04:55;04:57;"the biggest touring acts in the world."
04:57;05:00;"We've talked on the show that Roger Waters presents, you know, whatever."
05:00;05:01;"Yeah."
05:01;05:03;"Those are some of the biggest grossing tours of all time."
05:03;05:05;"We went to the Staples Center."
05:05;05:06;"Yes, we saw him at the Staples Center."
05:06;05:09;"So I'm like, so what's up with the Australian Pink Floyd show?"
05:09;05:13;"And this guy, well, first of all, the fact that they're based in the UK is like, OK,"
05:13;05:13;"why?"
05:13;05:17;"And it's partially because I think they're so hot and Europe's such a big market for"
05:17;05:18;"them."
05:18;05:20;"They can't be flying from Australia all the time."
05:20;05:24;"So I was like, as any kind of a professional musician has to say, what kind of rooms are"
05:24;05:24;"these guys doing?"
05:24;05:28;"And one person said, well, last time I saw them, I think it was in Geneva."
05:28;05:30;"And it was like, you know, they do like small arenas."
05:30;05:32;"And I was like, how many people were there in Geneva?"
05:32;05:34;"And they're like, I think about like 6,000."
05:34;05:35;"Wow."
05:35;05:37;"And I was like, wait, wait, wait."
05:37;05:38;"I know Pink Floyd is popular."
05:38;05:43;"And I could totally imagine like a successful Pink Floyd band that's like, you know, covering"
05:43;05:45;"that, you know, making it a full time job."
05:45;05:48;"Yeah, but 5,000, that's like bigger than Vampire Weekend."
05:48;05:49;"Most bands."
05:49;05:50;"Bigger than most bands."
05:50;05:52;"And I was like, what's special about them?"
05:52;05:55;"And they were like, well, you know, they're really good at playing Pink Floyd songs."
05:55;05:57;"And they bring some like Australian sense of humor."
05:57;05:58;"And I was like, like what?"
05:58;06:02;"And they were like, if on their video screen, they put up like the dark side of the moon"
06:02;06:09;"prism, you know, instead of the triangle, it'll be like the shape of Australia."
06:09;06:10;"That is rich."
06:10;06:11;"That is really funny."
06:11;06:15;"And they're like, they'll recreate Pink Floyd album covers with like Australian jokes in"
06:15;06:16;"it."
06:16;06:18;"And I was like, you know, fair play."
06:18;06:18;"I get it."
06:18;06:20;"If you're Australian, you love Pink Floyd."
06:20;06:23;"You're going to be making kind of inside jokes like that."
06:23;06:23;"Yeah."
06:23;06:25;"But again, is that a joke even?"
06:25;06:27;"It's a visual."
06:27;06:28;"Technically, it's a joke."
06:28;06:34;"But then they're playing at a 7700 capacity arena in the Czech Republic."
06:34;06:37;"You're just like a Czech Pink Floyd fan."
06:37;06:40;"You're like into that Australian Pink Floyd based humor."
06:40;06:40;"It just sounds so specific."
06:40;06:44;"Maybe you're starved for rock shows in Czech Republic."
06:44;06:45;"Maybe."
06:45;06:46;"Vampire's not going to Czech Republic."
06:46;06:48;"Yeah, no one else is doing it."
06:48;06:49;"They don't want to see us."
06:49;06:50;"How do you guys sell that out?"
06:50;06:51;"That's 77."
06:51;06:54;"We'll probably get an email from like the one hardcore TC head in the Czech Republic."
06:54;06:54;"Yeah."
06:54;06:58;"But what kind of attitude is that to say that they don't want to see you?"
06:58;06:59;"You're right."
06:59;07:03;"We got Australian Pink Floyd is like, we know they want us over there."
07:03;07:05;"They'll go anywhere."
07:05;07:08;"Maybe I got to send the Australia Vampire Weekend band first."
07:08;07:08;"Yeah."
07:08;07:10;"To kind of play some scenes."
07:10;07:12;"Actually, Vampire Weekend's never played in Eastern Europe,"
07:12;07:16;"which is a real shame because, you know, I'm Eastern European,"
07:16;07:18;"but we're going for the first time this summer."
07:18;07:19;"Maybe you want to come to that one."
07:19;07:20;"It's the motherland, Poland."
07:20;07:22;"I've never been there."
07:22;07:23;"You want to come to the festival in Poland?"
07:23;07:24;"Yeah, kind of."
07:24;07:27;"I can't get you an opening slot because it's a festival, but you can come."
07:27;07:28;"I'll just hang out."
07:28;07:29;"Yeah."
07:29;07:30;"Oh, is your mom born in Poland?"
07:30;07:31;"Yeah."
07:31;07:33;"It'd be a fun mother son trip."
07:33;07:34;"Doubt."
07:34;07:35;"My mom was trying to go back to Poland."
07:35;07:37;"She was there."
07:37;07:40;"It wasn't so good over there when she was there."
07:40;07:42;"Might be some bad memories for her."
07:42;07:43;"Oh yeah, fair."
07:43;07:44;"Fair enough."
07:44;07:47;"But back to the US concerts, because that's where you guys are playing."
07:47;07:50;"We've painstakingly crafted these bills."
07:50;07:53;"So, Despot, you're playing the Madison Square Garden show."
07:53;07:54;"Yeah."
07:54;07:55;"Which is in September."
07:55;07:56;"Yes."
07:56;07:59;"And that's Despot, Angelique, Kijo, and Vampire Weekend."
07:59;08:01;"I think it's a very strong bill."
08:01;08:02;"Very excited about it."
08:02;08:03;"Me too."
08:03;08:03;"What are you going to do?"
08:03;08:05;"Is it just going to be you and a DJ?"
08:05;08:06;"Think so, yeah."
08:06;08:07;"I'm going to rap."
08:07;08:08;"All right."
08:08;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:10;"So everybody, I know it's in seven months."
08:10;08:11;"Get there early."
08:11;08:12;"It could just be me."
08:12;08:14;"I haven't really decided yet."
08:14;08:17;"Because when I tour, it's usually just me, and I always think that's really funny."
08:17;08:20;"And it's even funnier at Madison Square Garden."
08:20;08:22;"With like an early 2000s iPod?"
08:22;08:23;"iPad."
08:23;08:24;"iPad?"
08:24;08:25;"Yeah, I like to go iPad."
08:25;08:26;"I'm kind of into that."
08:26;08:29;"Yeah, with the nice little, you know, wire cable."
08:29;08:30;"That's going to be tight."
08:30;08:32;"Into some DI boxes."
08:32;08:34;"I think, yeah, maybe you got to just lean into it."
08:34;08:34;"Yeah."
08:34;08:36;"Not trying to put on like a big laser light show."
08:36;08:38;"No, I'm going to do that too."
08:38;08:38;"Oh really?"
08:38;08:39;"Yeah."
08:39;08:42;"I'm spending millions of dollars on this show."
08:42;08:44;"I mean, it's the garden."
08:44;08:44;"Yeah."
08:44;08:45;"Legendary venue."
08:45;08:47;"Once in a lifetime."
08:47;08:48;"Because I think I'm going to die this year."
08:48;08:49;"Oh no."
08:49;08:51;"But not before September?"
08:51;08:52;"After the show, yeah."
08:52;08:52;"All right."
08:52;08:53;"Maybe that night."
08:53;08:54;"All right."
08:54;08:56;"Yeah, maybe on stage."
08:56;08:58;"Oh no, then they're going to have to like clear it out, and then we won't get to play."
08:58;08:59;"That's really disrespectful."
08:59;09:01;"You'll still get to play."
09:01;09:01;"They won't care."
09:01;09:03;"Oh no, they'll shut it down."
09:03;09:06;"No, Madison Square Garden is like, it's like the mob."
09:06;09:07;"The show must go on."
09:07;09:10;"I bet they have a place in there where they put the bodies."
09:10;09:12;"There actually could be some bodies in there."
09:12;09:13;"Yeah."
09:13;09:13;"Anyway, the..."
09:13;09:15;"Damn, guys."
09:16;09:17;"Let's lighten the mood a little bit."
09:17;09:19;"So we're really excited."
09:19;09:19;"So we're real excited."
09:19;09:23;"The one thing about that show that I'm excited about is,"
09:23;09:25;"we normally don't like to play arenas too much."
09:25;09:28;"And in fact, on the last album, we played a few here and there."
09:28;09:30;"And I was kind of like, this just feels weird."
09:30;09:33;"But the garden, you make a special exception for."
09:33;09:35;"It's like right in the heart of town."
09:35;09:36;"Yeah."
09:36;09:37;"It's cozy."
09:37;09:38;"It's kind of the best one."
09:38;09:42;"I don't know that much about arenas, and we're definitely not trying to play too many."
09:42;09:47;"But apparently in arenas, it's all about the angle of the audience."
09:47;09:52;"So you can do like a 180 show, or you could do a 270 show, or you could do a 360."
09:52;09:53;"Oh, wow."
09:53;09:56;"Because you can picture like a typical show, the stage is back at like,"
09:56;09:58;"kind of like one of the baskets."
09:58;09:59;"Right, right."
09:59;10:02;"But we kind of, you know, I don't like handle all this stuff."
10:02;10:06;"I have to check out a little bit with some of the touring stuff, because it's like so hardcore."
10:06;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:08;"But our touring dudes were like, well, we'll put it up."
10:08;10:09;"We'll see how it does."
10:09;10:11;"And if there's a strong demand, we can go 360."
10:11;10:13;"And I was like, oh, so what's that like?"
10:13;10:17;"And they're like showing me pictures of like Pearl Jam and Bruce doing 360 at the Garden,"
10:17;10:21;"which basically means you just sell the tickets behind the stage."
10:21;10:22;"Non-rotating stage."
10:22;10:23;"Non-rotating stage."
10:23;10:26;"So in one sense, they're not good tickets."
10:26;10:28;"They're significantly cheaper because they're like obstructed."
10:28;10:32;"But it's also just kind of like a better vibe, because then like everybody's looking at each"
10:32;10:33;"other."
10:33;10:36;"You know, you get that full like 360 round the room energy."
10:36;10:37;"Wow."
10:37;10:39;"Is there any way you could play to those people?"
10:39;10:45;"Can you like turn around and run to the other side of whatever type of curtain is there?"
10:45;10:46;"I think you can."
10:46;10:47;"Because I'm going to do that."
10:47;10:48;"You could turn around a little bit."
10:48;10:51;"Yeah, especially you, because maybe you get a headset, Mike, so you can really work the"
10:51;10:52;"back."
10:52;10:53;"Definitely."
10:53;10:56;"The 180 tickets, because those are like the quote unquote good seats went real quick."
10:56;10:57;"Yeah."
10:57;10:59;"But now they're selling the ones like behind."
10:59;11:00;"To MSG."
11:00;11:01;"Yeah."
11:01;11:01;"Wow."
11:01;11:05;"So we're doing full 360 there, but it's like those ones go a little slower, but they're"
11:05;11:05;"cheap."
11:05;11:09;"So it's kind of like if you got the right attitude, I think you roll up there and you're"
11:09;11:10;"like, you know what?"
11:10;11:11;"We're not going to be seeing all the action."
11:11;11:15;"We're just going to feel the energy of the room of the room."
11:15;11:16;"Found some brews."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah."
11:17;11:19;"If I was going to this show, that's where I'd sit."
11:19;11:20;"Yeah, for sure."
11:20;11:23;"If they were saying you could sit for free anywhere you want, you're going to go there."
11:23;11:26;"It's like sitting in the bleachers of a Yankee game."
11:26;11:27;"Yeah."
11:27;11:29;"I mean, in some ways, it's a little vibe."
11:29;11:29;"Yeah."
11:29;11:32;"Sometimes you want to sit front row, but that's also like super intense."
11:32;11:34;"You can just kind of sit in the back."
11:34;11:34;"It's chill."
11:34;11:38;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
11:38;11:41;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
11:41;11:44;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
11:44;11:46;"Huff and puff if you ain't flowing down."
11:46;11:50;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
11:50;11:54;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
11:54;11:57;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
11:57;11:59;"Huff and puff if you ain't flowing down."
11:59;12:03;"Running on fumes, walking on coals."
12:03;12:06;"Pockets on road games, pulled out of control."
12:06;12:09;"Green means go, red means go."
12:09;12:12;"I'm colorblind, mother f***er, I don't know."
12:12;12:16;"Beat a beat in the block, I'm pleading and squeezing the juice out."
12:16;12:19;"Deezer screaming to stop, I'm fleeting the scene with the too loud."
12:19;12:22;"Money talking, you showing off, then that money talk too loud."
12:22;12:25;"Slap a gag order on the wall and cut Benjamin's tongue out."
12:25;12:27;"Then get presidents from out."
12:27;12:30;"Won't be no more discussion, go so hard in the paint."
12:30;12:33;"I'm f***ing and busting under the bucket and run amok on you."
12:33;12:35;"Quits and bits and cuss up in public."
12:35;12:37;"My club up ain't one to f*** with."
12:37;12:38;"Not for nothing, you nothing."
12:38;12:41;"Stopping slime, y'all are snot rockets."
12:41;12:45;"Got a lot of products stocked in the dockers, that's hot pockets."
12:45;12:48;"Fresh out the car wash, still got a dirty trunk."
12:48;12:51;"Out for that gold plaque like some old dirty front."
12:51;12:55;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
12:55;12:58;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
12:58;13:01;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
13:01;13:04;"Puff and punch if you ain't blowing down shit."
13:04;13:04;"Look down shit."
13:04;13:08;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
13:08;13:11;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
13:11;13:14;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
13:14;13:17;"Puff and punch if you ain't blowing down shit."
13:17;13:21;"One fish, two fish, platinum fish, gold fish."
13:21;13:24;"So rich I burn bridges to keep a stove lit."
13:24;13:27;"Put the queen's furrow in my pipe and smoke it."
13:27;13:30;"Then scrape the road clean and blaze it to the roach clip."
13:30;13:33;"I play them corners like a rook on a chessboard."
13:33;13:36;"Couple thousand dollars worth of work in the guest drawers."
13:36;13:40;"Up and down the block, play ring and run up a desk door."
13:40;13:43;"Ain't bother asking coppers what I'm under arrest for."
13:43;13:46;"I let it splatter in the batter till it's magnifique."
13:46;13:50;"The motor roller blow up till battery acid leap."
13:50;13:53;"A grand feast on the block, so let the man eat."
13:53;13:56;"This one's on the house, I prefer it off the damn street."
13:56;13:59;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
13:59;14:02;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
14:02;14:05;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
14:05;14:09;"Puff and pump if you ain't blowing down shit."
14:09;14:12;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
14:12;14:15;"Hand over hand over hand over fist."
14:15;14:18;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks."
14:18;14:21;"Puff and pump if you ain't blowing down shit."
14:21;14:23;"It's the oh my god father of soul."
14:23;14:26;"Rock and roll, stop, drop, lock and load."
14:26;14:28;"Dot, dot, dot, you know the rest."
14:28;14:31;"Holes in chest, lay souls to rest."
14:31;14:35;"Close the mess, best protect next or you'll be next."
14:35;14:38;"I hold weight, then distribute it post haste."
14:38;14:41;"Get whole birds on a arm, I'm ghost face."
14:41;14:44;"Making tall orders, taking no shorts."
14:44;14:47;"How'd that little guy get on such a high horse?"
14:47;14:50;"But then also at the Chicago show,"
14:50;14:52;"that's the one that Richard Pictures are playing at."
14:52;14:52;"Yeah."
14:52;14:54;"I'm excited about all the shows,"
14:54;14:56;"but of course like these are cities we've played a lot,"
14:56;14:59;"so they're, you know, New York's very dear to my heart."
14:59;15:00;"And then Chicago I'm psyched about"
15:00;15:02;"because it's on Father's Day."
15:02;15:04;"I haven't hyped that up too much."
15:04;15:07;"Because I was like, you know, let the people of Chicago"
15:07;15:08;"decide if they want to go to the show."
15:08;15:10;"But part of the reason that I asked Richard Pictures"
15:10;15:12;"to come to that one, you guys are playing Hollywood Bowl,"
15:12;15:14;"makes sense, you live in LA."
15:14;15:16;"Makes total sense for us to play the Hollywood Bowl."
15:16;15:18;"Makes a lot of sense."
15:18;15:22;"But then in Chicago, I was kind of disappointed"
15:22;15:23;"because last year on Father's Day weekend,"
15:23;15:24;"we did the Ojai shows."
15:24;15:25;"Yep."
15:25;15:27;"Which I think was a great kickoff."
15:27;15:28;"Tremendous weekend."
15:28;15:30;"That was a great weekend, legendary weekend."
15:30;15:33;"And then I was kind of bummed to be like,"
15:33;15:34;"""Oh, the album's going to come out in the spring"
15:34;15:37;"and then we can't really just drop everything,"
15:37;15:38;"go back to Ojai."""
15:38;15:40;"But then it turned out like, ""Oh, we're playing in Chicago"
15:40;15:41;"and it's going to be like a sick outdoor show."""
15:41;15:42;"So you guys are coming through."
15:42;15:46;"We also got Chicano Batman who's opening that leg for us."
15:46;15:46;"That's going to roll."
15:46;15:47;"So that's going to roll."
15:47;15:49;"And we can, I mean, I'm excited about the music,"
15:49;15:52;"but I'm also very excited that we can bring back"
15:52;15:54;"the legendary Father's Day weekend t-shirt."
15:54;15:54;"Oh yeah."
15:54;15:55;"The long sleeve."
15:55;15:56;"Oh yeah."
15:56;15:57;"Which Jake rocks."
15:57;15:58;"Version two."
15:58;15:59;"Oh, all the time."
15:59;16:00;"For people who don't know, this is,"
16:00;16:03;"I think this is the closest thing to a Vampire Weekend grail."
16:03;16:05;"Yeah, I think it's the best shirt."
16:05;16:06;"It's probably our best shirt."
16:06;16:06;"Yeah."
16:06;16:08;"It's a long sleeve t-shirt."
16:08;16:10;"And in the Vampire Weekend Futura Bold font,"
16:10;16:12;"it says Father's Day weekend."
16:12;16:14;"And then there's a big frog and a little frog on a branch."
16:14;16:16;"It's just a real classic shirt."
16:16;16:17;"I didn't get one."
16:17;16:18;"I have a couple."
16:18;16:19;"All right, cool."
16:19;16:22;"That one also, it sold out very quickly at Ojai."
16:22;16:26;"Is that like an afternoon show in Chicago or what's the deal?"
16:26;16:26;"Evening?"
16:26;16:27;"It's at night."
16:27;16:29;"Yeah, it probably starts like early evening."
16:29;16:30;"Okay, cool."
16:30;16:31;"So it'll probably be like, you know,"
16:31;16:33;"sun will be up and then we'll go down halfway through."
16:33;16:34;"Nice."
16:34;16:37;"So anyway, I'm excited that we can bring back that shirt for Chicago."
16:37;16:38;"That's going to be very special."
16:38;16:40;"But in Chicago, there's like a similar thing."
16:40;16:45;"In the last few weeks, I've, I really haven't thought about like venues and tickets in years."
16:45;16:46;"Yeah."
16:46;16:50;"So I kind of like really dip back in people like keeping me updated on some of this stuff."
16:50;16:53;"And in Chicago, it's in a place called Northerly Island."
16:53;16:54;"I've never been there."
16:54;16:56;"I guess it's kind of like on the lake."
16:56;16:56;"Cool."
16:56;17:00;"And then there's like this kind of like terrace seated amphitheater vibe."
17:00;17:04;"So I think more or less all the tickets are sold out for like the seats."
17:04;17:07;"But then there's this like endless lawn in the back."
17:07;17:10;"So now they're selling like these kind of relatively cheap lawn tickets."
17:10;17:11;"Yeah."
17:11;17:14;"I think if you're asking people to come just like hang super far back on the lawn,"
17:14;17:17;"you really got to provide a good atmosphere."
17:17;17:18;"You rolling at dusk."
17:18;17:20;"We're doing like a 10 minute bird song."
17:20;17:20;"Yeah."
17:20;17:21;"Well, that's going to be a good atmosphere."
17:21;17:22;"That's a chill."
17:22;17:24;"That's a soft landing."
17:24;17:25;"But I feel like..."
17:25;17:25;"At the show."
17:25;17:26;"That is."
17:26;17:28;"That's going to be a good vibe."
17:28;17:34;"Oh, I know a song like a bird within her sing."
17:34;17:48;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
17:55;18:01;"Tell me all that you know, I'll show you."
18:01;18:03;"Snow and rain."
18:03;18:17;"When you hear that same song again, you know why."
18:17;18:35;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
18:35;18:45;"I hear the sunshine sing right in the door."
18:45;18:51;"Fly through the night."
18:51;18:57;"Don't I know."
18:57;19:05;"Oh, I know."
19:05;19:11;"Oh, I know."
19:11;19:12;"Oh, I know."
19:12;19:16;"Is there going to be like a lot seen at the vampire weekend shows?"
19:16;19:17;"I don't know."
19:17;19:18;"A lawn scene."
19:18;19:20;"I mean, I think we got to create a lawn scene."
19:20;19:22;"There was a bit of a lawn scene in Ojai."
19:22;19:23;"Yeah."
19:23;19:24;"Oh, I kind of had a good lawn scene."
19:25;19:28;"We had our merch guys just like running game."
19:28;19:30;"I think maybe to create a good lawn atmosphere."
19:30;19:34;"Maybe it should be something like where Richard pictures merch guy is not at the official merch"
19:34;19:35;"booth."
19:35;19:35;"Yeah."
19:35;19:36;"But you got to find them on the lawn."
19:36;19:38;"You guys should you got to do some special Chicago."
19:38;19:39;"Oh, yeah."
19:39;19:41;"We're going to do some Chicago merch for sure."
19:41;19:44;"I got to hire a guy to come out and run merch."
19:44;19:45;"Oh, maybe we need a local Chicago guy."
19:45;19:46;"Okay."
19:46;19:46;"Yeah."
19:46;19:47;"Good call."
19:47;19:48;"You got any Chicago buddies?"
19:48;19:50;"No, but I think we can ask her."
19:50;19:51;"I think I think."
19:51;19:52;"I like little Dirk."
19:52;19:53;"Maybe we got it covered."
19:53;19:54;"You know, little Dirk."
19:54;19:54;"No."
19:54;19:57;"You know any Chicago rappers?"
19:57;19:59;"Yeah, I know a bunch."
19:59;20:00;"Not little Dirk, though."
20:00;20:02;"I don't know if they want to."
20:02;20:03;"That would be sick."
20:03;20:04;"And also because it's Father's Day."
20:04;20:07;"I was trying to think like when I was talking to like the touring dudes, I was like, well,"
20:07;20:08;"it's Father's Day."
20:08;20:11;"It's the perfect day to kind of come chill on the lawn."
20:11;20:11;"Good atmosphere."
20:11;20:16;"But like the first thing I asked is like, well, if a dad's coming through with his family,"
20:16;20:20;"can he maybe set up a small charcoal grill on the lawn?"
20:20;20:21;"I don't think so."
20:21;20:24;"I think most venues don't allow that."
20:24;20:25;"That is a liability."
20:25;20:27;"If she has someone's dad to sell the merch."
20:27;20:29;"Yeah, that's true."
20:29;20:30;"Get a dad."
20:30;20:30;"Little Dirk's dad."
20:30;20:32;"Let's get some dads out there."
20:32;20:34;"All this talk of cover bands."
20:34;20:36;"I was wondering, is there a Vampire Weekend cover band?"
20:36;20:37;"Have you heard of one?"
20:37;20:39;"Because it wouldn't surprise me."
20:39;20:40;"In fact, it would surprise me if it wasn't."
20:40;20:41;"It's got to be."
20:41;20:45;"I don't know if there's like enough of a market for it, especially because we've been so quiet"
20:45;20:46;"for the past five or six years."
20:46;20:51;"I mean, maybe depending on how this year goes, somebody could start one."
20:51;20:56;"Wait, OK, here's what's not permitted in the Huntington Bank Pavilion."
20:56;20:57;"Weapons."
20:57;20:57;"All right."
20:57;21:00;"Which a small charcoal grill could be a weapon."
21:00;21:00;"That's true."
21:00;21:02;"Yeah, you can f*** somebody up with that."
21:02;21:04;"Alcohol, drugs."
21:04;21:05;"Weak."
21:05;21:06;"Well, I guess you could buy alcohol."
21:06;21:07;"Umbrellas."
21:07;21:08;"Long scene."
21:08;21:09;"I mean, I think they should."
21:09;21:11;"Well, umbrella?"
21:11;21:12;"Yeah, it's weird."
21:12;21:13;"Laser pointers."
21:13;21:14;"It's disruptive."
21:14;21:14;"Umbrellas suck."
21:14;21:15;"I hate them."
21:15;21:17;"I guess they really, even when it's raining."
21:17;21:19;"I think you're an a***** if you have an umbrella."
21:19;21:20;"When it's raining?"
21:20;21:23;"Yeah, wear a f***ing rain jacket and put your hood on."
21:23;21:26;"Stop taking up space and hitting people in the face and f***."
21:26;21:28;"But you're still going to get your face all wet."
21:28;21:29;"OK."
21:29;21:29;"All right."
21:29;21:32;"You heard of your first test on anti-umbrella."
21:32;21:35;"No laser pointers, no skates, no wallet chains."
21:35;21:36;"That's weird."
21:36;21:38;"What could that be about?"
21:38;21:39;"That's a weapon, man."
21:39;21:40;"That's a weapon."
21:40;21:41;"To like choke somebody out?"
21:41;21:43;"Yeah, or you could whip it at them."
21:43;21:45;"That's what I always do with my wallet chain."
21:45;21:48;"No ice chests."
21:48;21:49;"No banners."
21:50;21:50;"What?"
21:50;21:51;"Also a weapon."
21:51;21:52;"No flyers."
21:52;21:53;"What?"
21:53;21:54;"No flyers."
21:54;21:55;"No beach balls."
21:55;21:56;"No frisbees."
21:56;21:58;"These guys are just a complete bummer."
21:58;22:00;"They could have just said no weapons."
22:00;22:01;"All these things."
22:01;22:04;"They could have just said don't bring anything in."
22:04;22:05;"Well, wait, hold on."
22:05;22:08;"No fireworks, no outside food or beverages."
22:08;22:09;"Well, OK, maybe the whole vibe."
22:09;22:11;"I think a lot of these venues, their whole vibe is like,"
22:11;22:13;"you got to buy it from, you know, it's like whatever."
22:13;22:14;"Go to a basketball game."
22:14;22:16;"You got to buy it from us."
22:16;22:18;"So they'll sell like ninja stars there."
22:18;22:21;"Yeah, I think you could probably buy all this stuff at the merch stand."
22:21;22:22;"Yeah."
22:22;22:24;"They don't say you can't bring a hacky sack."
22:24;22:25;"That's kind."
22:25;22:26;"That's a good vibe."
22:26;22:31;"Maybe after you guys play, Richard Pictures could run like a dunk tank or something on the lawn."
22:31;22:32;"I doubt they let you bring that."
22:32;22:33;"All right, we'll figure something out."
22:34;22:36;"Twenty twenty one."
22:36;22:37;"We think about me."
22:37;22:40;"I could wait, but I shouldn't wait."
22:40;22:40;"Three."
22:40;22:43;"I don't want to be."
22:43;22:49;"Twenty twenty one."
22:49;22:51;"We think about us."
22:51;22:54;"Copper goes green, stay beans go rust."
22:54;22:56;"It's a matter of."
22:57;23:03;"Boy."
23:04;23:10;"Boy."
23:10;23:14;"Boy."
23:14;23:20;"Boy."
23:20;23:24;"Boy."
23:24;23:28;"Twenty twenty one."
23:28;23:29;"We think about me."
23:29;23:32;"I could wait, but I couldn't wait."
23:32;23:33;"Three."
23:33;23:34;"Boy."
23:34;23:35;"I don't want to be."
23:35;23:39;"Boy."
23:39;23:41;"Twenty twenty one."
23:41;23:43;"We think about us."
23:43;23:45;"Copper goes green, stay beans go rust."
23:45;23:48;"It's a matter of."
23:48;23:50;"Boy."
23:50;23:53;"Oh yeah, okay."
23:53;23:54;"There was some thing."
23:54;23:54;"Oh, here we go."
23:54;24:02;"In 2009, there was some story that there was a Craigslist ad about a Vampire Weekend cover band."
24:02;24:05;"And it kind of just seemed like a weird joke, but somebody was like,"
24:05;24:06;"I want to start a Vampire Weekend cover band."
24:06;24:09;"It's going to be called the VW Bugs."
24:09;24:12;"And then I guess there was an interview where they tracked down the person who started it."
24:12;24:13;"Wow."
24:13;24:14;"A woman named Catherine."
24:14;24:18;"And she said the group existed and they were practicing, recording and planning gigs and"
24:18;24:20;"will be the subject of a web based documentary."
24:20;24:23;"So you got to keep in mind this is we only had one album out."
24:23;24:25;"This is 10 years ago at the time."
24:25;24:26;"And I guess they had a MySpace."
24:26;24:27;"Is there music on it?"
24:27;24:28;"I wonder if they gigged."
24:28;24:29;"I don't think so."
24:29;24:31;"I think it was just like a weird joke."
24:31;24:35;"And I think also like on the internet in 2009, something like this could get a little more"
24:35;24:36;"traction."
24:36;24:38;"Today, that would just be like a tweet."
24:38;24:41;"Somebody would be like, wouldn't it be funny to start a Vampire Weekend cover band?"
24:41;24:41;"Right."
24:41;24:43;"There was no outlet for that back then."
24:43;24:44;"Right."
24:44;24:48;"This is like you saw something on Craigslist and you're like, I'm going to write an article about"
24:48;24:48;"this."
24:48;24:50;"Okay, wait."
24:50;24:51;"Then they got more into it."
24:51;24:53;"In this post 9/11 internet age, we live in."
24:53;24:57;"It's possible for the tribute band to usurp the power of the band to which they are paying"
24:57;24:58;"tribute."
24:58;24:58;"Okay."
24:58;24:59;"What?"
24:59;25:04;"The younger 9/11, the younger generation has grown used to not paying for intellectual"
25:04;25:06;"property and in so doing respects it less."
25:06;25:10;"In this way, the vampire contribute band is a sort of thought experiment on the inherent"
25:10;25:13;"morality of the internet and what meritocracy is."
25:13;25:14;"This is garbage."
25:14;25:15;"Where was this article?"
25:15;25:18;"Cover bands are, I mean, predate the internet."
25:18;25:20;"I don't want to say it, but it's kind of Borghese."
25:20;25:24;"It's pretty Borghese."
25:24;25:27;"Dude, imagine a Greta Van Fleet cover band."
25:27;25:28;"Oh, that's."
25:28;25:29;"Do we have Zeppelin covers?"
25:29;25:30;"Wait, that's sick."
25:30;25:34;"Or even just like Paige and Plant busting out a Greta Van Fleet song."
25:34;25:36;"Oh, that would be really sick."
25:36;25:41;"I guarantee that the somebody at the Grammys floated the idea of Greta Van Fleet teaming"
25:41;25:43;"up with Paige and Plant at the Grammys."
25:43;25:44;"Right."
25:44;25:45;"Paige was in, Plant declined."
25:45;25:47;"Yeah, seriously."
25:47;25:47;"Oh my God."
25:47;25:50;"I know, but a Greta Van Fleet cover band is a sick idea."
25:50;25:50;"Did they play?"
25:50;25:52;"Maybe that's my next project."
25:52;25:52;"Yeah."
25:52;25:53;"Did they play the Grammys?"
25:53;25:54;"I didn't watch the Grammy."
25:54;25:56;"No, they won a Grammy though."
25:56;25:57;"Best rock album."
25:57;26:00;"Best rock album, but they didn't win best new artist, which for people who remember."
26:00;26:02;"That was disgust."
26:02;26:02;"Who won that?"
26:02;26:04;"Oh, you guys did all this already."
26:04;26:04;"It's all good."
26:04;26:08;"Well, yeah, this happened a couple of weeks ago, but we were saying before that Greta"
26:08;26:10;"Van Fleet could not win best new artist."
26:10;26:15;"Even though we respect their postmodern playfulness, if Greta Van Fleet won best new artist, it"
26:15;26:16;"would be a bad look for rock."
26:16;26:18;"Because my whole thing is that rock needs to be humble."
26:18;26:21;"But then best new rock, would they win band?"
26:21;26:22;"Best new rock album."
26:22;26:24;"No, it was just best rock album."
26:24;26:24;"No, sorry."
26:24;26:26;"Best rock album."
26:26;26:28;"So isn't that almost even worse?"
26:28;26:30;"Because then it's like targeted."
26:30;26:30;"It's rock."
26:30;26:33;"No, but I'm saying like, I don't like when people hate on them because it's like, whatever."
26:33;26:38;"These guys love Led Zeppelin and they're doing their thing and they love the old world and"
26:38;26:39;"you know, they're having fun."
26:39;26:47;"What's like a thing that in music, a band or even just an idea that you like when people"
26:47;26:48;"hate on?"
26:48;26:49;"Great question."
26:49;26:52;"Wait, what's something in music that."
26:52;26:54;"That you agree with the."
26:54;26:54;"That me?"
26:54;26:56;"The hateration on."
26:56;26:57;"Oh, because you're really."
26:57;26:59;"I'm very, I'm very diplomatic and positive."
26:59;27:02;"Which I guess I appreciate because I get I'm the opposite."
27:02;27:07;"Maybe I only like dislike artists if like I know proof positive that they're like an"
27:07;27:07;"ass."
27:07;27:09;"But even then that's that's not about being an artist."
27:09;27:10;"That's about a human thing."
27:10;27:12;"It actually has nothing to do with their art."
27:12;27:13;"Slippery slope here."
27:13;27:17;"Yeah, it's a slippery slope, but no, just somebody who like people say their music sucks"
27:17;27:18;"and I'm like, yeah, that sucks."
27:18;27:19;"It does suck, yeah."
27:19;27:21;"I bet it's nobody."
27:21;27:23;"Yeah, kind of nobody."
27:23;27:27;"I mean, the you know, I've got my opinions."
27:27;27:31;"It's one thing to have your opinion when you're just shooting this with you guys."
27:31;27:37;"Yeah, but it's another thing to be like, I want to go out and hurt this person's feelings"
27:37;27:42;"like go go write a review that's really cruel to Greta Van Fleet or leave a mean comment."
27:42;27:47;"This is me being mean to you and anyone who you might have mentioned."
27:47;27:49;"So you're not going to do it."
27:49;27:54;"So I'm just trying to think like, you know, when I watched the Grammys, I didn't particularly"
27:54;27:59;"enjoy the whole show, but I didn't really like see anything that one where I was like"
27:59;28:02;"it all like more or less made sense to me."
28:02;28:05;"Yeah, sometimes I was like, that's not what I would have picked, but whatever."
28:05;28:09;"And as we discussed, I was unfairly locked out of Grammy voting."
28:09;28:13;"Somebody pointed out that there was a tie in one category."
28:13;28:14;"I could have been the tiebreaker."
28:14;28:18;"What was the best traditional R&B performance?"
28:18;28:21;"That was a tie between Leon Bridges and PJ Morton featuring Yeba."
28:21;28:23;"Also best rap performance."
28:23;28:26;"It was a tie between Kings Dead and Bubbalin."
28:26;28:30;"Bubbalins by Anderson .Paak and Kings Dead is Kendrick and James Blake and all sorts of"
28:30;28:31;"people."
28:31;28:32;"Who are you voting for?"
28:32;28:33;"I think I might have never heard either."
28:33;28:34;"Ezra didn't vote."
28:34;28:41;"Alec, if you don't know the last day of voting, Grammy voting eligibility or whatever, I went"
28:41;28:45;"on the website and it was the day and they had already closed voting."
28:45;28:46;"Probably only for you."
28:46;28:47;"It's possible."
28:47;28:48;"Yeah, too diplomatic."
28:48;28:49;"I'm too diplomatic."
28:49;28:51;"Okay, best rap performance."
28:51;28:56;"The choices were Be Careful by Cardi B, Nice for What, Drake, Kings Dead, Kendrick J Rock,"
28:56;28:59;"Future James Blake, Bubbalin, Anderson .Paak, Sicko Mode, Travis Scott."
28:59;29:01;"I would have gone Sicko Mode."
29:01;29:05;"I mean, Sicko Mode is kind of undeniably the best rap performance of those."
29:05;29:05;"Yeah."
29:05;29:09;"But I might have voted for Cardi B just because I want to see Cardi B win."
29:09;29:11;"Yeah, that would have felt better."
29:11;29:14;"And Cardi B did win Best Rap Album, so that's cool."
29:14;29:15;"Yeah, that is cool."
29:15;29:17;"I wanted her to win Album of the Year."
29:17;29:18;"That didn't happen, but it's all right."
29:18;29:20;"Who won Album of the Year?"
29:20;29:21;"Kacey Musgraves."
29:21;29:22;"And I like Kacey Musgraves."
29:22;29:23;"I'm a fan."
29:23;29:26;"But it would have been cool for Cardi B to win it, first album."
29:26;29:28;"Do you know either of the two that were tied?"
29:28;29:30;"No, I don't know that Anderson .Paak song."
29:30;29:31;"Me neither."
29:31;29:35;"I might have voted for Kings Dead just because I'm so diplomatic and I'd say, if I vote for"
29:35;29:38;"Bubbalin, Anderson .Paak wins a Grammy."
29:38;29:44;"If I vote for Kings Dead, I'd be giving one to Kendrick, J Rock, Future, and James Blake."
29:44;29:45;"Yeah, Everybody Eats."
29:45;29:46;"That's right."
29:46;29:48;"So that's kind of one of those moral questions."
29:48;29:49;"If you could feed one man or feed four men."
29:49;29:52;"Is that the song from Black Panther?"
29:52;29:55;"Yeah, Kings Dead is one of the songs from Black Panther."
29:55;29:56;"Tight song."
29:56;29:57;"I don't know it."
29:57;29:58;"Should we listen to it?"
29:58;30:01;"I feel like we should listen to both and then you can vote on it."
30:01;30:02;"Hopefully it's the same song I'm thinking of."
30:02;30:04;"You're hearing it here first, folks."
30:04;30:09;"Two weeks after the Grammys, we finally decide if I voted."
30:09;30:13;"Remember there was that OJ Simpson wrote the book that never came out called If I Did It?"
30:13;30:13;"Yeah."
30:13;30:14;"This is my book."
30:14;30:19;"If I voted in the 2019 Grammys, I could have changed history."
30:19;30:39;"You know, his first line was missing me with the bullsh*t and I have a really good idea"
30:40;30:44;"for a female rapper that involves that phrase."
30:44;30:46;"Missing me with the bullsh*t."
30:46;30:48;"His first line was miss me with the bullsh*t."
30:48;30:50;"I want a female rapper."
30:50;30:57;"Her name is Miss Me, Ms.me and her first single is with the bullsh*t."
30:57;30:58;"That's cool."
30:58;30:58;"Come on."
30:58;30:59;"That's good."
30:59;31:00;"Someone got to do it."
31:00;31:02;"And Miss Me is just kind of a good name."
31:02;31:04;"Yeah, Miss Me, that works."
31:04;31:04;"All right."
31:04;31:05;"I get it."
31:05;31:07;"Yeah, that song is sick."
31:07;31:08;"It's pretty good."
31:08;31:10;"We didn't hear James Blake's part."
31:10;31:11;"I don't think."
31:11;31:14;"You never know."
31:14;31:18;"Definitely never heard this."
31:18;31:22;"I think I maybe heard King's Dead for a second in an Uber or something."
31:22;31:26;"Was that the same sample as Britney?"
31:26;31:27;"Oh, Toxic?"
31:27;31:29;"Yeah."
31:29;31:29;"Could be."
31:29;31:43;"This is Kendrick again."
31:43;31:55;"Similar flow."
31:55;31:56;"It's close."
31:56;31:59;"It's probably just some other Bollywood."
31:59;32:02;"Yeah, they're both referencing Bollywood strings."
32:02;32:07;"If I'm honest, I wouldn't have affected the category because those are both good songs."
32:07;32:09;"It would have been Sicko Mode, man."
32:09;32:11;"I would have voted for Sicko Mode or Cardi B."
32:11;32:13;"Yeah, Sicko Mode is a good song."
32:13;32:15;"Yeah, Sicko Mode is pretty undeniable."
32:15;32:16;"Yeah."
32:16;32:17;"I mean, it's funny."
32:17;32:20;"It's like in some categories, it's like popularity shouldn't matter."
32:20;32:26;"But then it is weird when just like a generally beloved hit song like Sicko Mode is not honored."
32:26;32:28;"Yeah, this song is a good song."
32:28;32:30;"And also Sicko Mode is three songs in one."
32:30;32:31;"Yeah, that's true."
32:31;32:33;"Do you know this song, Jake?"
32:33;32:33;"I don't think so."
32:33;32:34;"Is this Sicko Mode?"
32:34;32:35;"Yeah."
32:35;32:36;"Good title."
32:36;32:37;"Yeah, right?"
32:37;32:40;"Yeah, this is amazing."
32:40;32:42;"It's never been in the top five for us."
32:42;32:44;"This is like one of the biggest songs of the year."
32:44;32:44;"Astro."
32:44;32:48;"Yeah."
32:48;32:54;"Sun is down, freezing cold."
32:54;32:56;"Sun is down, freezing cold."
32:56;32:58;"That's how we already know."
32:58;33:02;"When it's here, my dog will probably do it for me."
33:02;33:06;"Well, the cover of that single is tie-dye."
33:06;33:10;"The mix of hippie and some black metal funk."
33:10;33:14;"I tried to show."
33:14;33:19;"So the first minute is this vibe."
33:19;33:20;"And then..."
33:23;33:24;"Oh, not yet."
33:24;33:24;"It's coming."
33:24;33:35;"Yo, did you hear somebody remade this out of all Animal Crossing sounds?"
33:35;33:36;"It's sick."
33:36;33:39;"They remade the beat with Animal Crossing sounds."
33:39;33:42;"And they did the vocals with little Animal Crossing sounds."
33:42;33:43;"So it's like..."
33:43;33:47;"It's sick."
33:47;33:51;"That's my favorite song, actually, of 2018."
33:51;33:52;"Sicko Mode, Animal Crossing."
34:13;34:15;"This might be eligible for the Grammys next year."
34:15;34:15;"Yeah."
34:31;34:32;"What do you mean Animal Crossing?"
34:32;34:34;"It's a video game."
34:34;34:35;"Oh."
34:35;34:36;"That people play on..."
34:36;34:38;"Gotcha."
34:38;34:40;"Facebook a lot or Nintendo DS."
34:58;34:59;"I don't know, man."
34:59;35:01;"It kind of sounds for babies, if I'm honest."
35:01;35:01;"There you go."
35:01;35:02;"Honest opinion."
35:02;35:04;"Yeah, you know, I don't like to talk..."
35:04;35:05;"I don't like to talk..."
35:05;35:07;"It's the first time you ever hated on anything."
35:07;35:11;"Because any artist that's out there sticking their neck out, I respect."
35:11;35:12;"The artist in this case."
35:12;35:15;"I don't know the names of the characters in Animal Crossing, but..."
35:15;35:16;"I'm not hating."
35:16;35:18;"I'm just saying it kind of sounds like it's for babies."
35:18;35:21;"Well, Sicko Mode doesn't sound like it's for babies?"
35:21;35:22;"No, it sounds like it's for adults."
35:22;35:23;"Interesting."
35:23;35:26;"I just think because Sicko Mode, you actually can hear the words and stuff."
35:26;35:26;"And this is like..."
35:27;35:28;"You know, it's like..."
35:28;35:29;"What is that?"
35:29;35:30;"It suggests..."
35:30;35:32;"You know the words already."
35:32;35:32;"Yeah, I guess you have a point."
35:32;35:34;"Maybe this one's for adults, actually."
35:34;35:36;"It's very sophisticated."
35:36;35:37;"Because it's assuming you know the words."
35:37;35:38;"Fair point."
35:38;35:40;"It is kind of Borgesian in a way."
35:40;35:40;"Yeah."
35:40;35:42;"Anyway, we got a lot of Patrick World songs."
35:42;35:44;"I don't think you've heard any of them yet."
35:44;35:44;"I haven't."
35:44;35:48;"For some reason, SoundCloud doesn't work on my phone."
35:48;35:48;"Do you have the app?"
35:48;35:50;"No, I don't have..."
35:50;35:51;"I know."
35:51;35:53;"When you play it off the browser on the phone, it's weird."
35:53;35:54;"Yeah, it's just..."
35:54;35:55;"Because it's a widget."
35:55;35:55;"Yeah, it's really annoying."
35:55;35:56;"I don't know what that means."
35:56;35:57;"So let's check it out."
35:57;36:02;"This is a friend of the show, Patrick World, who's blessed us with so many great songs."
36:02;36:04;"And he made one specifically for Jake's birthday."
36:04;36:04;"Right."
36:04;36:06;"It's called Shallow Birthday."

38:47;38:48;"♪ Baby, it's 2019 ♪"
38:48;38:51;"Wait, why doesn't this guy have an opening slot"
38:51;38:52;"on one of those shows?"
38:52;38:54;"We could bring him up in Montreal."
38:54;38:54;"I think we're--"
38:54;38:55;"You kinda have to."
38:55;38:58;"He really nailed my impression of Florida Georgia Line."
38:58;38:59;"Wait, actually, hold on."
38:59;39:00;"I forgot to tell you guys this."
39:00;39:01;"This is crazy."
39:01;39:03;"Florida Georgia Line's opening for Vampire?"
39:03;39:04;"No, because--"
39:04;39:06;"And you're opening for Florida Georgia Line."
39:06;39:07;"You're in Florida Georgia Line."
39:07;39:10;"There's this thing before the Grammys called the Clive Davis Dinner."
39:10;39:12;"Is he the guy that manages Metallica?"
39:12;39:14;"No, that's Cliff Bernstein."
39:14;39:14;"Okay."
39:14;39:18;"Clive Davis ran Arista Records,"
39:18;39:21;"and he was instrumental in the careers of Whitney Houston or Reetha,"
39:21;39:22;"you know, just a legendary guy."
39:22;39:23;"Sure."
39:23;39:26;"And so he throws this thing that's this kind of famous"
39:26;39:29;"night before the Grammys dinner party thing."
39:29;39:30;"I almost went once."
39:30;39:31;"Oh, did you?"
39:31;39:32;"But I didn't."
39:32;39:34;"It's interesting."
39:34;39:35;"It's at the--"
39:35;39:36;"I wasn't invited or anything."
39:36;39:38;"It's in the same place where they have the Golden Globes,"
39:38;39:39;"the Beverly Hilton."
39:39;39:39;"Okay."
39:39;39:41;"I'd never been before,"
39:41;39:43;"and my manager said, ""You wanna come?"""
39:43;39:44;"And I was like, ""Yeah, sure."""
39:44;39:46;"And you know, so we got there."
39:46;39:49;"As a showbiz professional, I know at least a handful of people."
39:49;39:50;"And there's all sorts of random people."
39:50;39:52;"Our boss, Tim Cook, was there."
39:52;39:53;"Did you meet him?"
39:53;39:54;"No, I didn't meet him."
39:54;39:56;"David Hockney was there."
39:56;39:56;"Wow."
39:56;39:57;"It was like a real who's who."
39:57;39:58;"Did you say hi to Hockney?"
39:58;40:00;"No."
40:00;40:03;"Did you recognize him or someone was like, ""That's David Hockney""?"
40:03;40:05;"A bunch of people were like, ""We're gonna go say hi to David Hockney."""
40:05;40:08;"Why the hell is David Hockney at the pre-Grammys dinner?"
40:08;40:10;"It's in California, right?"
40:10;40:11;"Yes, he's a California guy."
40:11;40:12;"He's a California guy, yeah."
40:12;40:15;"I'm aware he's a prominent Los Angeles artist."
40:15;40:17;"There were like guys from the Super Bowl there."
40:17;40:17;"Wow."
40:17;40:20;"Maybe he painted the party."
40:20;40:20;"Yeah."
40:20;40:24;"All like the old school music biz legends."
40:24;40:25;"Rashida's dad was there."
40:25;40:26;"Kind of funny, just like running down-"
40:26;40:28;"The Hockney just blew my mind, but anyway."
40:28;40:30;"Joey Mitchell was there."
40:30;40:31;"Really?"
40:31;40:32;"Did you say hi to her?"
40:32;40:33;"No, I don't know them."
40:33;40:35;"Wait, did you say hi?"
40:35;40:36;"Are you leading up to who you did say hi to?"
40:36;40:37;"Okay, okay."
40:37;40:40;"No, I mean, I saw people who work at the label."
40:40;40:43;"But did you say hi to anyone that we would be like, ""Oh, he said hi to him or her""?"
40:43;40:44;"Okay, well, so it's not that."
40:44;40:47;"We go and there's kind of like this intense energy."
40:47;40:49;"There's like a lot of security to get through."
40:49;40:50;"Sure."
40:50;40:51;"I mean, Hockney's there."
40:51;40:52;"Yeah, Hockney's there."
40:52;40:53;"Did he bring a painting?"
40:53;40:55;"No, but he was dressed like an artist."
40:55;40:56;"Other people were more conservative."
40:56;40:57;"He had like a cool hat on?"
40:57;40:58;"He had like a cool suit."
40:58;41:00;"You know, whatever I see-"
41:00;41:03;"Like really colorful or just like an interesting shape?"
41:03;41:03;"Yeah, kind of colorful. No, colorful."
41:03;41:06;"So you smoked a bowl with Hockney and Joey Mitchell?"
41:06;41:06;"Oh, yeah."
41:06;41:12;"No, and I see at a distance, ""Oh, there's Diplo,"" and all the usual suspects."
41:12;41:12;"You say hi to him?"
41:12;41:15;"That's not interesting."
41:15;41:16;"Nope."
41:16;41:18;"No, I said hi to people from the label."
41:18;41:20;"I said hi to Rashida's dad and stuff."
41:20;41:21;"So there's all this schmoozing."
41:21;41:23;"Then they start serving dinner."
41:23;41:24;"So you're like, ""Get to your seat."""
41:25;41:28;"So then I go with my manager, and I'm sort of like plus one vibe."
41:28;41:29;"I'm along for the ride."
41:29;41:30;"Assigned seating."
41:30;41:30;"It's assigned seating."
41:30;41:31;"Yeah."
41:31;41:35;"So we sit down at our table, and there's only two seats left."
41:35;41:40;"So we squeeze right in those seats, and I look around, and there's a bunch of guys,"
41:40;41:44;"and then there's a somewhat younger woman, and there's some older people,"
41:44;41:46;"and me and my manager just pop down."
41:46;41:49;"And I'm just kind of like, ""All right, well, I don't know anybody at our table."""
41:49;41:50;"You know, it's like being at a wedding or something."
41:50;41:51;"Sure, sure."
41:51;41:53;"I don't know anybody at our table."
41:53;41:55;"And then I sit down, and the guy next to me is very nice."
41:55;41:59;"I really appreciate this, because at the end of the day, I'm kind of a shy person."
41:59;42:03;"Or I'm more just like, you know, in public, don't bother people."
42:03;42:05;"If they want to talk, they'll talk to you."
42:05;42:08;"But that can also sometimes, you're the person who should be saying hi."
42:08;42:09;"You know, it's always hard to know."
42:09;42:11;"You know, are you being weird by not saying hi?"
42:11;42:14;"But anyway, it's always nice, I think, when you sit down at some kind of bizarre event"
42:14;42:17;"like that, and the person next to you just introduces themselves."
42:17;42:18;"Yeah."
42:18;42:19;"And just gets it going."
42:19;42:20;"Out of the gate."
42:20;42:24;"Yeah, so then this guy, you know, a little bit older than me, just kind of turns to me"
42:24;42:28;"and says, ""Hey, man, what do you have to do with all this going on?"""
42:28;42:29;"And I was like, ""Oh, I'm a musician."""
42:29;42:31;"And he's like, ""Oh, that's cool."""
42:31;42:32;"He's like, ""What kind of music?"""
42:32;42:35;"And I'm like, ""Well, I'm in a band called Vampire Weekend."""
42:35;42:36;"And he goes, ""Oh, that's interesting."
42:36;42:37;"Let me guess."
42:37;42:38;"Alternative?"""
42:38;42:40;"And I was like, ""Guilty as charged."""
42:40;42:42;"And I was like, ""What's your deal?"""
42:42;42:43;"Or whatever."
42:43;42:44;"And he's like, ""Well, my name's Chief."""
42:44;42:46;"And I was already like, ""Sick."""
42:46;42:47;"Chief Keef."
42:47;42:48;"Yeah, it was Chief Keef."
42:48;42:50;"This guy's friendly and his name's Chief."
42:50;42:52;"I already just get a great vibe off this dude."
42:52;42:54;"And I say, ""Well, how about you, Chief?"""
42:54;42:57;"And he's like, ""Well, me and this guy to my left manage these guys."
42:57;43:00;"And then there's two more guys, but they are the other side of the table."
43:00;43:02;"They're a country duo called Florida Georgia Line."""
43:02;43:02;"That's tight."
43:02;43:05;"Well, then I realized I didn't know what Florida Georgia Line really looked like."
43:05;43:08;"And then I kind of look at them and I'm like, ""Yo, whoa, I'm two seats away from Florida"
43:08;43:09;"Georgia Line."""
43:09;43:10;"And I'm very familiar with their catalog."
43:10;43:11;"I'm very familiar."
43:11;43:12;"Well, at least a few songs."
43:12;43:12;"Yeah."
43:12;43:14;"I'm a little bit starstruck."
43:14;43:16;"And I start chopping it up with Chief."
43:16;43:17;"Super nice guy."
43:17;43:19;"And we just start talking a little bit."
43:19;43:20;"And I asked him where he was from."
43:20;43:22;"He says, ""Vancouver."""
43:22;43:23;"And I was so curious about this."
43:23;43:25;"And I was like, ""Vancouver?"
43:25;43:27;"That's got to be kind of rare in country music."""
43:27;43:30;"Because they're based in Nashville now, at least partially."
43:30;43:34;"And I was like, ""Man, how do you end up going from Vancouver to Nashville?"""
43:34;43:39;"And then he told me that for years, he was the longtime tour manager of Nickelback."
43:39;43:39;"Which makes sense."
43:39;43:40;"Nickelback's Canadian."
43:40;43:41;"Potbeckins."
43:41;43:43;"So now I'm fascinated."
43:43;43:45;"Because I never knew there was a Nickelback FGL connection."
43:46;43:48;"It makes a lot of sense, aesthetically."
43:48;43:49;"It kind of does make sense."
43:49;43:51;"Oh, and also another thing that's interesting is in the music industry,"
43:51;43:53;"and I was also pretty impressed by this,"
43:53;43:57;"is that it's very rare to go from being a tour manager to a manager."
43:57;44:00;"If you work in live music, you often tend to work in live music your whole life."
44:00;44:04;"If you're a really good tour manager for a huge band like Nickelback,"
44:04;44:06;"you might just do that for the rest of your life."
44:06;44:09;"There's these old school tour managers, very well paid."
44:09;44:12;"Because they're running a small army across the world."
44:12;44:13;"So it's not a classic transition."
44:13;44:18;"So you have to really have some drive, some ambition, some insight to do it."
44:18;44:21;"And I'm like, ""How does that transition work? I've never heard of that."""
44:21;44:22;"And then I looked it up."
44:22;44:23;"This is public information."
44:23;44:25;"He got to know Nickelback's main producer."
44:25;44:29;"So he starts managing the producer, dipping his toes into the management world."
44:29;44:30;"And then at some point,"
44:30;44:34;"Nickelback's producer is looking to find some new artists to work with."
44:34;44:36;"And at a state fair or something,"
44:36;44:39;"he comes across these two guys who turn out to be Florida Georgia Line."
44:39;44:41;"And this guy's immediately like, ""Well, these guys are sick."
44:41;44:42;"They start working again."""
44:42;44:45;"So I didn't realize that there's a producer and management connection"
44:45;44:48;"between Nickelback and Florida Georgia Line."
44:48;44:53;"And this guy, Chief, and his partner, whose name I don't remember, unfortunately,"
44:53;44:57;"they saw these two dudes and they immediately saw star potential"
44:57;44:58;"and they started managing them."
44:58;45:00;"And now Florida Georgia Line is truly massive."
45:00;45:05;"Was this in Florida and/or Georgia that they caught this state fair gig?"
45:05;45:06;"That's unclear to me."
45:06;45:08;"But it was truly that random?"
45:08;45:10;"Well, it was a little random, but it was via the producer."
45:10;45:14;"But anyway, there's this whole interesting Nickelback, Florida Georgia Line connection."
45:14;45:15;"So already I'm stunned."
45:15;45:16;"And it's also just an interesting-"
45:16;45:17;"I'm stunned right now."
45:17;45:19;"It's an interesting music industry connection."
45:19;45:22;"And the Florida Georgia Line guys, I didn't really get to jawbone with them."
45:22;45:25;"And they were also there with their wives or girlfriends."
45:25;45:27;"But they seemed like they were just having a great time."
45:27;45:28;"They seemed like kind of chill dudes."
45:28;45:30;"Then my manager's to my right,"
45:30;45:34;"and he's striking up a conversation with a very elegant older man."
45:34;45:35;"So he brings me into that conversation."
45:35;45:36;"He goes, ""Well, Ezra's from New Jersey."""
45:36;45:38;"And this guy's talking about how he does some work in New Jersey."
45:38;45:39;"And I'm like, ""Where are you from?"""
45:39;45:41;"And he's like, ""Well, you know, I live on Staten Island."""
45:41;45:43;"And I'm kind of like, ""Oh, that's cool."
45:43;45:43;"You're like a New Yorker."""
45:43;45:45;"And he said, ""Well, originally I'm from Europe."""
45:45;45:48;"And then I'm kind of like taking chief's lead."
45:48;45:50;"And I'm kind of like, ""Oh, what brings you to this event?"""
45:50;45:51;"And he's like, ""Well, we're here with my daughter."""
45:51;45:53;"You know, and then he gestures to his daughter,"
45:53;45:54;"who's sitting at the other end of the table."
45:54;45:56;"And I was like, ""Oh, is she a musician?"""
45:56;45:58;"He said, ""Oh, yeah, she's a singer named Bebe Rexha."
45:58;46:00;"She's performing with these guys."""
46:00;46:02;"And then I realized that me and my manager,"
46:02;46:05;"the only people sitting at the meant to be table."
46:05;46:07;"It's literally the meant to be table."
46:07;46:09;"And you just got squeezed in there."
46:09;46:12;"I mean, I couldn't believe my luck."
46:12;46:15;"I mean, if Seinfeld was here, he'd be losing his mind."
46:15;46:17;"The two people I met at the table were both very nice."
46:17;46:20;"Shout out to chief from the FGL crew"
46:20;46:21;"and shout out to Bebe Rexha's dad."
46:21;46:23;"He was a really sweet guy."
46:23;46:23;"What's his name?"
46:23;46:25;"Like John Rexha?"
46:25;46:26;"I gotta be honest, I didn't catch his name,"
46:26;46:28;"but he was one over from me."
46:28;46:29;"Was Bebe at the table?"
46:29;46:29;"Yeah, no, she was-"
46:29;46:30;"You didn't recognize her?"
46:30;46:31;"No, I-"
46:31;46:33;"I just found out she was from New York."
46:33;46:35;"I wouldn't recognize her."
46:35;46:36;"Seinfeld would have."
46:36;46:39;"I didn't quite know what any of these people looked like."
46:39;46:40;"I know what she looks like."
46:40;46:41;"She's from New York."
46:41;46:42;"She's from New York."
46:42;46:44;"Dude, how sick would it be if the party planner"
46:44;46:46;"was actually a TC head?"
46:46;46:47;"Oh yeah."
46:47;46:50;"And deliberately placed you there."
46:50;46:51;"That'd be amazing."
46:51;46:51;"You never know where-"
46:51;46:52;"I could see it."
46:52;46:53;"TC heads are like a secret society."
46:53;46:55;"Like then the waiter brought-"
46:55;46:57;"Skull and bones, dude."
46:57;46:59;"Then at the end, the waiter brought me a second dessert"
46:59;47:00;"and was like, ""On the house."""
47:00;47:02;"On the house, my friend."
47:02;47:04;"It was that pancake from-"
47:04;47:06;"It was the pancake from the Harmony Hall video."
47:06;47:07;"(laughs)"
47:07;47:08;"So anyway, yeah."
47:08;47:09;"It's just popcorn and raisins."
47:09;47:10;"(laughs)"
47:10;47:12;"He brought us a tray of popcorn and raisins"
47:12;47:13;"and then silently nodded."
47:13;47:15;"The waiter came back and it was Seinfeld"
47:15;47:17;"and he just like went like, ""Shh."""
47:17;47:21;"So anyway, I'm sitting there and I'm like-"
47:21;47:22;"Jesus."
47:22;47:23;"At an event like that, I'm always ready"
47:23;47:25;"to just kind of like check out."
47:25;47:25;"Yeah."
47:25;47:27;"And then I'm like, ""Whoa, now I'm back."
47:27;47:28;"""This is exciting."""
47:28;47:30;"But then here's the downside."
47:30;47:30;"Uh-oh."
47:30;47:32;"I got to meet Chief and I got to meet BB's dad"
47:32;47:34;"and they're both super nice."
47:34;47:35;"But you know, I'm an artist"
47:35;47:37;"and I love to have artist to artist conversations."
47:37;47:38;"Oh, they wouldn't let you in."
47:38;47:39;"And I said, ""Chief, can you introduce me?"""
47:39;47:40;"He said, ""Absolutely not."""
47:40;47:41;"No."
47:41;47:42;"(laughs)"
47:42;47:43;"So we're just sitting there."
47:43;47:44;"But then here's the thing."
47:44;47:46;"Then the performances start."
47:46;47:46;"Uh-huh."
47:46;47:48;"And they perform ""Meant to Be"""
47:48;47:49;"at the Clive Davis function."
47:49;47:52;"So next thing you know, literally the entire table vanishes"
47:52;47:54;"to go backstage to get ready."
47:54;47:55;"And actually they were so polite."
47:55;47:57;"Like the Florida Georgia Line crew was like,"
47:57;47:57;"""Oh, don't worry."
47:57;47:59;"""We won't leave you guys alone too long."""
47:59;48:01;"But then, you know, they had to go do their thing."
48:01;48:03;"And normally I wouldn't bring it up"
48:03;48:06;"just to say like, you know, I'm a humble person."
48:06;48:08;"I try not to show off too much"
48:08;48:10;"about like say meeting an FGL."
48:10;48:12;"But the fact that I was, it wasn't just FGL."
48:12;48:13;"I was at the ""Meant to Be"" table."
48:13;48:14;"Oh yeah, no, I mean."
48:14;48:15;"I mean, talk about ""Meant to Be."""
48:15;48:16;"That's TC Cannon."
48:16;48:17;"That's TC Cannon."
48:17;48:19;"And then, you know, we watched them perform and-"
48:19;48:21;"How was the performance?"
48:21;48:22;"Honestly, they nailed it."
48:22;48:24;"And actually made me want to go deeper on FGL"
48:24;48:26;"because I realized on that song,"
48:26;48:29;"one of the guys sings lead and one guy sings harmony."
48:29;48:31;"I thought they both sang lead on that song."
48:31;48:32;"Oh, like traded?"
48:32;48:35;"No, but yeah, only one guy sings lead on it."
48:35;48:37;"Honestly, all their vocals sounded great."
48:37;48:38;"I don't know if they ended up winning any Grammys,"
48:38;48:40;"but it's a shame if they didn't"
48:40;48:42;"'cause that's obviously one of the songs of the year."
48:42;48:43;"You know, there's very few people"
48:43;48:45;"that I would go out of my way to jawbone with."
48:45;48:47;"FGL and Bebe Rexha perhaps,"
48:47;48:50;"just for the TC-ness of it, I might have to."
48:50;48:52;"But then it wasn't ""Meant to Be."""
48:52;48:52;"It wasn't."
48:52;48:55;"I think this is more the appropriate TC story."
48:55;48:56;"Yeah, that's what was meant to be."
48:56;48:57;"It's kind of a non-story."
48:57;48:59;"Yeah, this is what was meant to be."
48:59;48:59;"Yeah."
48:59;49:02;"A solid 15-minute segment on TC."
49:02;49:03;"Yeah, I almost forgot about that."
49:03;49:07;"So thank you, Patrick World, for reminding me."

50:53;50:54;"- I was just gonna wrap it up and say"
50:54;50:58;"Patrick World continues to just drop top level material."
50:58;50:59;"- Okay, and we got one more, so--"
50:59;51:00;"- We got one more?"
51:00;51:03;"- We got one more, we got a real backlog of Patrick World."
51:03;51:03;"He's very--"
51:03;51:04;"- Prolific."
51:04;51:05;"- He's very prolific."
51:05;51:09;"Last time we were talking about Ariana Grande's tattoo."
51:09;51:10;"Despot, you hear about this?"
51:10;51:10;"- Small charcoal grill."
51:10;51:12;"- Yeah, small charcoal grill, yeah."
51:12;51:12;"- So--"
51:12;51:13;"- What was this supposed to be though?"
51:13;51:15;"I forgot, oh, seven ring."
51:15;51:16;"- It was supposed to be seven rings."
51:16;51:18;"It actually said small charcoal grill."
51:18;51:19;"I'm sure we weren't the only people who said this,"
51:19;51:22;"but we were saying that knowing that Ariana Grande"
51:22;51:25;"is a very kind of savvy pop star,"
51:25;51:27;"she knows how to kind of surf popular culture."
51:27;51:31;"She knows how to weave her own personal life into her songs"
51:31;51:33;"and kind of use social media."
51:33;51:35;"- Remember when we went to Ariana Grande's show at Barclays?"
51:35;51:36;"- Oh, that's true."
51:36;51:38;"That was before she was like super cool."
51:38;51:39;"- She had Barclays though?"
51:39;51:41;"- No, no, that was at the Garden actually."
51:41;51:42;"- Was it?"
51:42;51:43;"- I think it was at the Garden."
51:43;51:46;"- I think it was Barclays, but she had that glove,"
51:46;51:48;"remember, that modulated her voice"
51:48;51:49;"and it was like some imaging he--"
51:49;51:50;"- Yeah."
51:50;51:53;"- That was sick, but she didn't keep doing that, did she?"
51:53;51:55;"- I don't know, maybe she does."
51:55;51:56;"Maybe it's like just part of her live camp,"
51:56;51:58;"you know it's how like Fish will every once in a while"
51:58;51:59;"jump on trampolines."
51:59;52:00;"- Right."
52:00;52:02;"- Ariana Grande every once in a while will be like,"
52:02;52:04;"""Now, you know, I haven't busted out the glove"
52:04;52:07;"""in about three and a half years."
52:07;52:08;"""Should I do it?"""
52:08;52:09;"That was also interesting 'cause it was like"
52:09;52:11;"she hadn't quite got the props she's getting now"
52:11;52:13;"as being like the super interesting one"
52:13;52:15;"or one of the super interesting ones."
52:15;52:17;"- And she showed like a documentary of her"
52:17;52:20;"and Imogen Heap like developing these gloves."
52:20;52:21;"- Yeah."
52:21;52:23;"- Like they were actually working on them together."
52:23;52:24;"- It was great."
52:24;52:26;"I remember, yeah, I remember walking away being like,"
52:26;52:27;"""It's like Frampton, dude."""
52:27;52:28;"- She's got a great voice."
52:28;52:28;"- Yeah."
52:28;52:30;"- Well, everybody already knew she had a great voice"
52:30;52:31;"and you know, some big songs,"
52:31;52:32;"but it was kind of like,"
52:32;52:34;"""Okay, she's a little experimental too."""
52:34;52:34;"- Yeah."
52:34;52:37;"- Now, flash forward to 2019,"
52:37;52:39;"she gets her Seven Rings tattoo,"
52:39;52:41;"turns out it's a small charcoal grill."
52:41;52:43;"There's a certain type of person"
52:43;52:44;"who couldn't come back from that."
52:44;52:46;"There's a type of weak singer"
52:46;52:48;"who would probably get roasted for that"
52:48;52:48;"and they'd be so embarrassed."
52:48;52:49;"- Just folds."
52:49;52:50;"- Who would that be?"
52:50;52:52;"- I'm not gonna say."
52:52;52:53;"- I know."
52:53;52:55;"- Maybe the guy who made the Animal Crossing."
52:55;52:57;"- Sicko mode."
52:57;52:58;"- That's f**ked up."
52:58;53:01;"You know that's who you're targeting of all people."
53:01;53:03;"- I just got a problem with that."
53:03;53:06;"Oh, wait, no, I forgot you convinced me that it's good."
53:06;53:06;"I actually like it."
53:06;53:07;"It's not baby music."
53:07;53:08;"- Yeah."
53:08;53:09;"- So anyway, we were saying that Ariana Grande,"
53:09;53:11;"if anybody would know what to do"
53:11;53:15;"with a pretty embarrassing tattoo snafu,"
53:15;53:16;"it would be Ariana Grande."
53:16;53:18;"And we started saying that she would probably"
53:18;53:19;"write a song on her next album."
53:19;53:20;"- I feel like you wrote the song."
53:20;53:21;"- We basically wrote the song"
53:21;53:24;"and it was like a trap song that just went,"
53:24;53:27;"""Small charcoal grill, small charcoal grill."""
53:27;53:29;"And then, you know, she would sing some R&B stuff"
53:29;53:32;"and, you know, talk about her hair."
53:32;53:34;"- That's just a very literal song."
53:34;53:36;"- Slab on my knob pattern there."
53:36;53:38;"- Yeah, but she came back into fashion"
53:38;53:40;"the past couple of years."
53:40;53:41;"Small charcoal grill."
53:41;53:44;"(mimics song)"
53:44;53:45;"Yeah, something about like,"
53:45;53:48;"she'll kill you if you talk about her tattoo."
53:48;53:49;"- Mm-hmm, of course."
53:49;53:51;"- And she'll probably, you know,"
53:51;53:52;"I think lately in her music,"
53:52;53:54;"there's been like a real confidence"
53:54;53:55;"and kind of braggadocio."
53:55;53:55;"- Yeah."
53:55;53:58;"- So maybe there'd be something about like,"
53:58;54:01;"I don't need to know how to read Japanese, you know?"
54:01;54:02;"- That's a little..."
54:02;54:04;"- Yeah, that probably wouldn't help her,"
54:04;54:05;"given some of her recent stuff."
54:05;54:08;"Like, okay, you know how to read Japanese."
54:08;54:08;"I just bought..."
54:08;54:09;"- Japan."
54:09;54:10;"- I just bought Japan."
54:10;54:12;"(laughs)"
54:12;54:13;"Yes, you know, I don't know."
54:13;54:15;"I don't wanna write, I'm not trying to write the song."
54:15;54:17;"I'm just saying that if anybody would kind of"
54:17;54:20;"take something a little embarrassing or awkward"
54:20;54:21;"and turn it into gold,"
54:21;54:22;"I could picture that a number one,"
54:22;54:24;"like she did that with ""Thank U, Next."""
54:24;54:25;"- Yeah, true."
54:25;54:27;"- You know, don't be surprised if this summer,"
54:27;54:30;"there's a number one hit song, Ariana Grande,"
54:30;54:32;"featuring Lil Durk, ""Small Charcoal Grill."""
54:32;54:33;"- Featuring Patrick World."
54:33;54:35;"- Okay, so anyway,"
54:35;54:37;"I guess Patrick World actually cooked up."
54:37;54:39;"- Ariana and Dirk would be good."
54:39;54:39;"It makes sense."
54:39;54:40;"- Yeah."
54:40;54:40;"- He sings."
54:40;54:42;"- Or maybe she would, yeah."
54:42;54:42;"All right, let's check it out."
54:42;54:44;"So this is Patrick World,"

55:38;55:39;"- It's quite a few."
55:39;55:41;"- Psyched for the TC vinyl."
55:41;55:44;"- But that you can't just keep running with that flow,"
55:44;55:45;"'cause that's Soulja Boy."
55:45;55:47;"- And that's 2 Chainz, really."
55:47;55:49;"- Well, I guess she got called out for this song."
55:49;55:50;"- Yeah, people were mad."
55:50;55:51;"- But they were mad."
55:51;55:52;"- Soulja Boy's really mad."
55:52;55:54;"- They're mad, but it still hasn't stopped the song."
55:54;55:55;"It's number one."
55:55;55:56;"- Is it? I don't know."
55:56;55:57;"- In many countries."
55:57;55:58;"- I believe that."
55:58;55:59;"That's cool."
55:59;56:00;"Good for her. I like her."
56:00;56:02;"- Aren't you allowed to steal flows in hip hop?"
56:02;56:03;"- Not really."
56:03;56:04;"- Really?"
56:04;56:06;"- I mean, a lot of people do it,"
56:06;56:07;"but I think it's frowned upon."
56:07;56:09;"- You gotta write new lyrics,"
56:09;56:11;"and they make a new beat,"
56:11;56:12;"and come up with a new flow?"
56:12;56:13;"- Yeah, man."
56:13;56:14;"- That's a lot."
56:14;56:15;"- I know."
56:15;56:18;"- That's a lot."
56:18;56:19;"- Yeah."
56:19;56:20;"- It's a lot you gotta come up with."
56:20;56:22;"- Yeah, three things."
56:22;56:27;"- I got seven rings, but I don't have three things."
56:27;56:28;"- Yeah, exactly."
56:28;56:29;"- All right."
56:29;56:32;"- What was ""Seven Rings"" about, anyway?"
56:32;56:35;"- That was a very confusing kind of black hole for TC."
56:35;56:37;"It's not one of our proudest moments."
56:37;56:37;"- All right."
56:37;56:39;"- We were trying to figure out what the song was about,"
56:39;56:44;"and also unpack the controversy about the song,"
56:44;56:46;"and she got into it with the Princess Nokia."
56:46;56:49;"- But did she get into it with her?"
56:49;56:49;"- Yes."
56:49;56:50;"- Oh, I didn't know that."
56:50;56:51;"- We at least know that much."
56:51;56:53;"- I thought Princess Nokia was--"
56:53;56:55;"- Arielle was doing some serious reporting."
56:55;56:56;"- Yeah."
56:56;56:59;"- I thought Princess Nokia was yelling into a vacuum."
56:59;57:02;"- No, apparently Ariana did respond,"
57:02;57:04;"but then she deleted it, and--"
57:04;57:05;"- Oh, I didn't know that."
57:05;57:06;"Well, good for both of them."
57:06;57:09;"- Basically, we were reading one of those crazy articles"
57:09;57:13;"that's kind of like gossipcop69xo.com"
57:13;57:15;"that just kind of like says like,"
57:15;57:18;"""Ariana Grande clap back, but then delete it,"""
57:18;57:21;"and it's just like, you just cannot follow the story."
57:21;57:23;"- What was the clapback? Do you remember?"
57:23;57:26;"- Uh, something about how she's not racist,"
57:26;57:28;"she's solving racism? Is that correct?"
57:28;57:30;"- Oh, that's a bad clapback."
57:30;57:31;"(laughing)"
57:31;57:33;"That is a take-backable clapback."
57:33;57:36;"- I don't even want to try to get into that again."
57:36;57:38;"- Well, I mean, good for her."
57:38;57:39;"Solve racism."
57:39;57:39;"So that's over?"
57:39;57:40;"(laughing)"
57:41;57:44;"Again, we're gonna have to crack open the books."

59:25;59:26;"- Interesting item."
59:26;59:30;"- This is something kind of flying around on the internet recently."
59:30;59:35;"Did you know that three of the four last US presidents"
59:36;59:40;"were born in 1946, the same year?"
59:40;59:45;"And not only the same year, we're talking about a two month span."
59:45;59:48;"Donald Trump was born June 14th, 1946."
59:48;59:52;"George W. Bush was born July 6th, 1946."
59:52;59:56;"And Bill Clinton was born August 19th, 1946."
59:56;59:59;"- So Bill Clinton was like our beautiful young president."
59:59;01:00:01;"- Well, now he's just as old as Trump and Bush."
01:00:01;01:00:05;"- Yeah, but when he was the president, he was a dashing young man."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- We got him in his prime."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Yeah, playing the saxophone."
01:00:08;01:00:12;"- The US Census Bureau considers 1946 to be the first year of the baby boom,"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"which lasted until 1964."
01:00:14;01:00:18;"And obviously Barack Obama is the one out of the last four"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"who was not born in 1946."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"He was born in 1961."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- Still a boomer."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I'm psyched for a Gen X president."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"- Oh man."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Just a real ironic president."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- Do we even wanna start talking about the primaries?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"- I think I should run for president"
01:00:31;01:00:34;"or like at least mayor of New York or something."
01:00:34;01:00:34;"- I'd vote for you."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- I think I'd win."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Why not?"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- I don't wanna do it."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- Give it a shot, man."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"- I think it's a bit of a thankless task."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"- Yeah, I don't wanna do it, but I wanna win."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"(laughing)"
01:00:45;01:00:49;"- You know, people are already starting to talk about, you know, Bernie."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- He's back."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- Bernie's back."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"- Where are you at with Bernie 2019/20?"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"- I mean, he's running and you know."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"- He's part of the TC story."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- He's part of the TC story."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I really got to crack open the books and see."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- You seem ambivalent."
01:01:02;01:01:06;"- You know, I got scars from all the culture wars, man."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"- So you're worried about it opening up a divisive fight within?"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"- Well, look, it's already divisive, so who knows?"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"But I guess, you know, we'll see who's left."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"We'll see how people do, but--"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"- It's too early to get too fired up about it."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- We got like coded language right there."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"We'll see who's left."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"- Yeah, we'll see who's really left."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Who's ready to lead the revolution."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"- Interesting."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"- Obviously, we gotta support whoever would win,"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"but some people have said this."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"It's kind of a bad sign if somebody wants to be president,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"but somebody needs to be president."
01:01:35;01:01:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"- Yeah."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"- It's like weird to want to be president."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"- Yeah, it's pretty weird."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"I want to be president."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"- You do want to be president?"
01:01:43;01:01:43;"- Yeah."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"- I mean, I guess the argument you would make for Sanders"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"is that he has a distinct worldview."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- He's consistent."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"I mean, it would be great to just get somebody--"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- I like that guy."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"He's like a professor from a Disney movie or some (beep)."
01:01:55;01:01:59;"Like he's all clumsy and like (beep) falling apart and blowing up."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"- He's invented flubber."
01:02:00;01:02:03;"- He says like, ""Gee willikers"" or something."
01:02:03;01:02:03;"Yeah."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"- Of course."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Of course I love Bernie."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I need to see what else, what's going on though."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- It's too early to get--"
01:02:09;01:02:09;"- It is early."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"- The primaries are a goddamn year away."
01:02:12;01:02:12;"- Yeah."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"Don't forget to register though."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- All right, that was--"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- Don't forget to register."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"- Our political coverage for the entire year."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"- We'll have plenty more to talk about."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"But I mean, don't you think this is weird"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"that these guys were all born in 1946?"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- You think they all came from like the same--"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- Within two months?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Giant egg."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"- Kind of."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- Big egg."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"- Yeah, there's something shady about it."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"- And they popped out of it and then they were incubated."
01:02:34;01:02:34;"- What are you talking?"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"I mean, it's just the baby boom."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"- They're all from like some weird fertility experiment."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"- Do you follow the Instagram account, Illuminati Killers?"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"- Wow."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"- I do follow a few conspiracy theory ones."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"What do they have to say?"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"- I don't know."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Crazy stuff."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- You don't wanna share?"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- Not really."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"(laughing)"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"- Theoretically, you would think that maybe every president"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"would get like a little bit younger."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Or you would say like, you know, if people like Bill Clinton,"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"you might say, all right, people like a president"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"who's around that age."
01:03:02;01:03:06;"- How old was he, like 50?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"- I think he was in his 40s."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"- He started in his 40s."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"But then it's weird."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"- So did Obama."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- It's just weird that, 'cause sometimes people talk"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"about the power of the baby boomers,"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"almost in like conspiracy theory terms."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"You know, you sometimes see this framework"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"where it's like the boomers versus millennials."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"And it's like the boomers hold power."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"They don't respect millennials and the struggle"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"and they took all the good jobs"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"and they don't know how good they have it."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"And they, whatever, they make fun of millennials"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"who clearly have less opportunity."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And you're kind of like, all right, well, obviously"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"we're talking about hundreds of millions of people."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"It's more complicated than that."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"And then you're like, but three presidents,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"20 years of presidency so far."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"We're all born in within two months in 1946."
01:03:45;01:03:48;"I'm not trying to go to Alex Jones, but come on."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"That's clearly some kind of weird phrase."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- I've seen the documents."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"- Yeah, it's weird."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"- It was in an egg."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"It was probably in an egg, a big egg."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- I think it was a big egg."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"- They all came out of the same big egg."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"- They came out of the same big egg."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"And we don't know exactly how these big eggs function."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- The big egg theory."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- It is definitely a big egg."
01:04:04;01:04:08;"And for all we know, the spawn come out of the big egg"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"over two months."
01:04:09;01:04:09;"- Right."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- That might seem kind of weird"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"in terms of what we know about human childbirth."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"But in the big egg, it's different."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"- Yeah, they incubate in the egg."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"They hatch at different rates,"
01:04:18;01:04:22;"depending on a bunch of things."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- Exactly."
01:05:13;01:05:13;"- Wait, hold on."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"What does this say?"
01:05:14;01:05:18;"This says that 1946 was the year of the fire dog."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"- What's that?"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"- In the Chinese year designations."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- Oh, you can't--"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- You get an animal and you also get like an element."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"Like wasn't it the year of the fire monkey recently?"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"- Oh, I didn't know that."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"I just knew it was the animal."
01:05:30;01:05:30;"I think I'm a dog."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"- A fire dog."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"- I know it's a pig right now,"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"but what is it, an ice pig or something?"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"I thought it was just a pig."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"- It would be crazy though,"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"if the Democratic nominee was another baby boomer."
01:05:41;01:05:44;"If it was like Sanders or, is Elizabeth Warren,"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"she's like 70, right?"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"- Younger than Bernie for sure."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"1946 was the year of the fire dog."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"And then 2006 was the next year of the fire dog."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"So we probably got some 13 year olds right now"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"who hatched out of the same egg pod."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"They got something going on."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"The fire dog has an extremely active"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"and outgoing personality."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- Wait, what if I'm a fire dog?"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- No, but you're not, 'cause you're just a dog."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"- What?"
01:06:08;01:06:12;"- Because the only fire dog years were 1946 and 2006."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"- But I gotta be a something dog, right?"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"- You're some kind of dog."
01:06:15;01:06:18;"- Where do you find out your element?"
01:06:18;01:06:18;"What is this?"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"- I don't know, but I'm just on some--"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Oh, I'm a water dog."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"- You're a water dog."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"You're the opposite of these dogs."
01:06:24;01:06:27;"You wanna hear some other famous dogs?"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"According to fengshuiweb.co.uk."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"- Yeah."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"- Sylvester Stallone."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"- Sick."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"- Donald Trump, we already knew that."
01:06:34;01:06:34;"- Yeah."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"- Freddie Mercury."
01:06:36;01:06:36;"- Great."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"- Elvis Presley."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"- Not so good."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"- I mean, but these are major dudes."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"- True."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Uma Thurman."
01:06:42;01:06:42;"- I like her."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"- Naomi Campbell."
01:06:43;01:06:43;"- I like her."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- Kate Bush."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- I like her."
01:06:45;01:06:45;"- Madonna."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"- She's cool."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"- David Bowie."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Whoa, that's a lot of major stars."
01:06:49;01:06:54;"Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, Madonna, Judy Garland, David Bowie."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- These are all fire dogs."
01:06:55;01:06:56;"- No, these are just dogs."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"- Oh, okay, good."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"(laughs)"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"- These are all just dogs."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- Well, I'm a dog."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Wow, fire dogs taking over."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"- What are you?"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"- It's a little embarrassing."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"- You're a rat."
01:07:06;01:07:06;"- Yeah."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Knew it."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"(laughs)"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- But hold on, let's see what kind of rat."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"Can you look up April 1984?"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Can I get a number crunch on..."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"- So every month has an animal?"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- It's every year."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"- Oh, every year."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"- Well, but I thought that the, I guess, does it just straight up"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"correspond to the Gregorian calendar?"
01:07:22;01:07:26;"- Well, it's a little bit, because the Chinese New Year is what?"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"The Lunar New Year is like January."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"- Yeah, so I thought maybe it's a little different."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"- Slightly."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- Oh, I'm a water rat."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"- I'm a water dog."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"- I guess we're two water dudes."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Okay, what about Jake?"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"You were born in '77?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- Yeah, February of '77."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Fire."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"- Fire snake."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- That's pretty dope."
01:07:43;01:07:43;"- Whoa, what?"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"- Wow."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"- That's way better."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- I don't know what any of this means, but..."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"- I would have thought you'd be something chill, like an earth..."
01:07:49;01:07:50;"- Dog."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- Earth dog."
01:07:51;01:07:51;"(laughs)"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"- Wait, no, I'm not in that year."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"It's February 18th, '77 to February 6th, '78."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"- When, what's your birthday?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"- February 3rd."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"- Oh, shoot."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"- Whoa, okay."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"- I'm 1976 then, what's that?"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"- We gotta get somebody on the show to actually explain this stuff to us."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"- I knew you weren't a fire snake."
01:08:08;01:08:08;"Couldn't be."
01:08:08;01:08:11;"- Now we're getting conflicting information here, folks."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"- Now earth dog."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"(laughs)"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Earth monkey."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"- Are you guys stoked for yesterday?"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"- For the movie ""Better World With No Beatles""?"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"I'll see it."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"- I mean, when I heard the concept..."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"- I didn't even know that."
01:08:23;01:08:26;"- It made no sense, but the trailer, honestly, kind of winning."
01:08:26;01:08:29;"- It's kind of a feel good trailer."
01:08:29;01:08:29;"- Yeah."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Fire dragon."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"- Fire dragon?"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"- It's even more badass."
01:08:34;01:08:34;"- Yeah, it's crazy."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"- Wait, yep."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- Mid-late '70s was no joke, folks."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"- You're a fire dragon, man."

01:17:23;01:17:24;"We're switching it up."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Now we're going even further into the past."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- What are we doing?"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"- 1946 versus 2019."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Why 1946, Despot?"

01:17:36;01:17:37;"- That's right."
01:17:37;01:17:42;"So 1946, Billboard had a chart."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"It had a slightly different name, but who cares?"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"Whatever, this is the Billboard 1946 top hits."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"So we're gonna be comparing them"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"to the top five songs on iTunes right now."

01:17:56;01:17:58;"Bing Crosby, well, he's famous."

01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Heard of him."
01:18:00;01:18:00;"- Yeah, I know who he is."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"- The song though, ""I Can't Begin to Tell You."""

01:34:16;01:34:18;"that they had ""Billboard 1946,"" I came across this."
01:34:18;01:34:18;"- Okay."

01:34:35;01:34:36;"- In February?"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"- In February, we're still a couple months out"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"from the first hatchling from the president egg."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"- All three presidents are in utero."

01:34:43;01:34:44;"- Dark."

01:34:46;01:34:47;"- Dude, Trump's just in utero."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- Fetus Trump."
01:34:48;01:34:53;"Anyway, so while Fetus Trump was gestating in Mama Trump--"

01:35:49;01:35:50;"- Yeah."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"- This track was written in Hollywood, California,"

01:35:56;01:35:58;"The songwriters, Sammy Kahn and Julie Stein,"

01:36:01;01:36:03;"that this was number two in February?"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"'Cause that's like so random."
01:36:05;01:36:08;"Like today, a Christmas song would never still be up there"

01:36:10;01:36:12;"- Maybe it wasn't a Christmas song."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"- Well, that's what I was also thinking about,"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"is like how all winter songs kind of became Christmas songs."
01:36:17;01:36:17;"- Yeah."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"- Nobody's ever like, ""Well, it's New Year's."

01:42:25;01:42:26;"- Right, I appreciate that."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"- Yeah."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"- I love Cardi B."
01:42:28;01:42:32;"The number one song in 1946."
01:42:32;01:42:35;"Now keep in mind, this is February, 1946."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"The snow is still falling."
01:42:36;01:42:40;"People haven't relegated winter music"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"to Christmas time yet."
01:42:41;01:42:44;"We got three presidents just sitting in an egg"
01:42:44;01:42:47;"and number one on the charts is Freddie Martin"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"and his orchestra with a song called ""Symphony."""
01:42:49;01:42:56;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:42:56;01:42:59;"- Oh, that sounds real old."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"- Someone's tied up on some train tracks."
01:43:00;01:43:02;"Oh, now it's getting fun."
01:43:02;01:43:06;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Ooh, some shredding."
01:43:07;01:43:23;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"This was in some movies, probably."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- Seems like it."
01:43:26;01:43:42;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- They're gonna be vocals?"

01:44:09;01:44:32;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"

01:44:37;01:44:39;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"- Whoa."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"- Long time for the vocals coming."
01:44:41;01:44:50;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"- You know back then everybody had their own big band."
01:44:52;01:44:55;"So you get these crews of 10, 20 guys"
01:44:55;01:44:56;"rolling around the country."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"It's all about who's got the best band."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"- Crazy."
01:44:58;01:45:03;"- So Freddie Martin's band was called by one jazz writer,"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"""One of the most pleasant, most relaxed dance bands"
01:45:06;01:45:09;"that ever flowed across the band scene."""
01:45:09;01:45:11;"So they were kind of the Grateful Dead of the band scene."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"- That's sick."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- They were laid back, mellow dudes."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"There probably were some more punk rock,"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"hardcore, up-tempo bands."
01:45:18;01:45:18;"- Yeah."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"- Freddie Martin, they're like--"
01:45:20;01:45:20;"- Nothing to prove."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"- Yo, jam it out, man."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"- I wonder if Jerry was into this kind of music."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"(orchestra playing ""Symphony No. 1"")"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Wouldn't have been that old at that point."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"- He might have had a soft spot for it."
01:45:30;01:45:33;"Wasn't his dad was a musician, so he might have played--"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"- I don't know much about his, yeah."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"- It's his dad was a musician,"
01:45:35;01:45:38;"so he might have been playing music in this era."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Yeah, what do we know about Jose Garcia?"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"- Not much."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"- We don't know a lot."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"And the number one song currently on iTunes right now,"
01:45:46;01:45:50;"the Freddie Martin of our era, ""Holdin' Strong."""

01:46:25;01:46:28;"they perform a lot of the nominees for best song."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"And of course, this is one of the major songs of the year,"

01:48:01;01:48:04;"Oh, he just told Stephen Colbert"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"that he'll perform the song in his tuxedo,"

01:48:15;01:48:16;"- I also just kind of feel like,"

01:48:18;01:48:20;"I took a couple of days off to think about this."
01:48:20;01:48:24;"At the end of the day, he doesn't get to decide this."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"It's incredibly arrogant."
01:48:26;01:48:29;"If I wanna imagine that I'm watching Jackson Maine performing,"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"well, it's the same goddamn face."
01:48:31;01:48:33;"It's the same person, you know?"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"- So he just shouldn't say he's anybody?"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"- Yeah, if I wanna picture that it's Chris Kyle,"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"the American sniper, duetting with Lady Gaga,"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"that's my right."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"And I think a lot of people will do that."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"- Yeah."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"- I'm just saying like--"
01:48:45;01:48:46;"- Both those characters are dead, but I mean--"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"- Yeah, but you can keep watching the movie."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"They live on in art."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- I didn't see the movie."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"- Do you think Bradley Cooper will speak"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"into the microphone at all,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"or just come up and sing?"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"'Cause that would be the real test if he's Jackson or not,"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"if he's like, ""Thank you."""
01:49:00;01:49:01;"- I think just sing,"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"because there's not a lot of time at these events."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"You got a minute and a half to do"
01:49:05;01:49:06;"like a short version of the song."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"I'm just saying--"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- They're not gonna do a full version?"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"- I don't know if they're gonna give them a full 3.30."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"- I need it."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- I mean, they gotta at least get to the big part."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"(singing)"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"- Yeah, but you can't get to the big part too soon."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"You gotta, you know."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"- Okay, maybe they will."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"- They're gonna do the full version."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"- Yeah, maybe for this song,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"they'll let him do the whole version."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"But, so Cooper said,"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"""Doesn't intend to bring back Jackson's deep voice either,"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"""as he said he has fully retired the character."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"""What are you gonna use a different singing voice?"""
01:49:30;01:49:31;"He's getting up there."
01:49:31;01:49:31;"He's performing."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"- This is so weird."
01:49:32;01:49:35;"- I mean, it's kind of like, okay."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"You know how like Beyonce has like her like onstage demeanor,"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"her onstage image are Sasha Fierce?"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"- Oh yeah, right, right."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"- Okay, maybe a better example would be like a rapper."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Snoop Dogg's real name is Calvin Brodus, correct?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"- Sounds right."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"- Yeah, it's Calvin something."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"- I believe it's Calvin Brodus."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"Now, we understand that Snoop Dogg"
01:49:53;01:49:56;"is both simultaneously Snoop Dogg and Calvin Brodus."
01:49:56;01:49:56;"- Yep."
01:49:56;01:49:59;"- To some extent, Snoop Dogg is a character."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"But, you know, there's also a huge intersection"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"in the same way that Bradley put his heart and soul"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"into that character."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"And the character Jackson made only exists"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"because of Bradley Cooper."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"- Yeah, but Calvin Brodus isn't like when I'm rapping"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"on Michael Jackson."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"I should have said a different name."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"(laughing)"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- Wait, say it again."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"- Like--"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"- No, Calvin Brodus says--"
01:50:19;01:50:24;"- I'm saying Jackson Maine is, what else is his name?"
01:50:24;01:50:24;"(laughing)"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"- I'm just saying if Calvin Brodus--"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"- If you take a regular-ass person like me,"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"it's different than being like,"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"my name is Alec Rhinestone,"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"but when I rap, I'm Snoop Dogg."
01:50:34;01:50:36;"It's different than being like,"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"my name's Alec Rhinestone,"
01:50:38;01:50:42;"but when I rap, I'm freaking, you know, John Smith."
01:50:42;01:50:43;"- Okay, what about Wiz Khalifa?"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- Wiz Khalifa, what's his name?"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- Cameron Jabril Tomas."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"- Yeah, what?"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"(laughing)"
01:50:51;01:50:54;"- I'm saying these guys have like alter ego names."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"- When Snoop Dogg became Snoop Lion,"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"- Yeah."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"- If he's gonna drop a Snoop Lion song"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"in his Snoop Dogg set,"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"are we gonna like pretend that Snoop Lion never existed"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"and this is Snoop Dogg performing a Snoop Lion song?"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"- Wait a second, also,"
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Cooper did not issue a press release."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"- No, he was just doing an interview."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"- Okay, so that's way different."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"It just kind of came out."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- I just think it's different"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"'cause you're talking about different types of pseudonyms."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"Like if my name is Alec Rhinestone"
01:51:22;01:51:26;"and my pseudonym when I'm performing is like, Assman,"
01:51:26;01:51:31;"that's not like if my pseudonym was Andrew Thomas."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"- I don't see the difference."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"- All right."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"(laughing)"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"- I'm just saying, how to put this,"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"I just don't think it's Bradley Cooper's choice, man."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"Like, first of all,"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"if you wanna go see A Star Is Born"
01:51:45;01:51:46;"and watch the whole film,"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"and say you walked out of the movie"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"and one person's very moved by it and said,"

01:52:01;01:52:04;"It's like, ""No, because when you watch a movie,"

01:52:32;01:52:33;"Sometimes you do, but like,"

01:52:49;01:52:50;"That's fair."
01:52:50;01:52:52;"All right, I see your point now."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"Especially when he's getting on stage"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"on Hollywood's biggest night."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"I also think it's disrespectful"
01:52:57;01:52:58;"to Hollywood's biggest night"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"to get up there and say,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"""I'm performing the song from the movie,"

01:53:04;01:53:05;"""I'm not acting right now."""
01:53:05;01:53:05;"Yeah."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Well, hold on a second."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"There's an element of acting."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"The only way that you can sing that song"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"is by embodying the character of Jackson Maine."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Right."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"If he sings it very differently,"
01:53:15;01:53:16;"I'll give it up to him and say,"
01:53:16;01:53:17;"""Okay, this time he's saying it as Bradley Cooper,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"""but I have a feeling he's gonna get up there"
01:53:19;01:53:22;"""and he's gonna give us that Jackson Maine performance"

01:53:23;01:53:25;"""the soundtrack, and the film."""
01:53:25;01:53:28;"If he wants to show us that he's going up on stage"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"as Bradley Cooper,"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"he needs to sing it with a different voice."
01:53:30;01:53:33;"♪ Baby, it's time to let the old ways die ♪"
01:53:33;01:53:39;"♪ Baby, it's time to let the old ways die ♪"
01:53:42;01:53:45;"♪ Takes a lot to change a man ♪"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"♪ Hell, it takes a lot to try ♪"
01:53:47;01:53:51;"♪ Baby, it's time to let the old ways die ♪"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"Either he's not allowing the audience"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"to use their imaginations,"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"or he's being so condescending"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"that he thinks that we're such morons."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"He's like, ""That's not me."""
01:54:02;01:54:04;"He thinks we're so stupid."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"I also just find like,"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"""Okay, when I perform on stage, I'm Bradley Cooper,"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"""but in the movie, I was Jackson Maine."""
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Right."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"Okay, well, I'm pretty sure when I sat down"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"and watched that movie,"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"I saw Bradley Cooper flash on screen about five times"
01:54:16;01:54:17;"before the show even started."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"So what are you doing here?"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"So you're insulted."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"I am insulted."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"I'm hurt."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"But I (beep) with Bradley Cooper."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"Oh, there you go."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"You're like, ""Oh, wait, am I hating?"""
01:54:28;01:54:29;"I like Bradley Cooper."
01:54:29;01:54:32;"Anyway, maybe the moral of the story"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"is everybody's right here."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"If Bradley takes the stage and he sings a song and says,"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"""I'm singing this as Bradley,"""
01:54:38;01:54:39;"and everybody else is watching and saying,"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"""Well, I'm seeing Jackson Maine,"""
01:54:41;01:54:44;"well, that's the magic of a Hollyweird."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"And also, shouldn't this be a decision"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"that he makes with his duet partner,"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Lady Gaga, aka Ali?"
01:54:50;01:54:51;"Imagine this."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"This is a huge role for her."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"She probably really embodied the character of Ali."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"What's Lady Gaga's real name?"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Stephanie Germanotta."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"What if she wanted to be Stephanie Germanotta"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"for this performance?"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"I could actually picture that."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Like, that could be a cool sequel to ""A Star is Born"""
01:55:05;01:55:07;"that's about a film."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"It's got the tone of the trip to Italy."
01:55:10;01:55:14;"And it's Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"get offered some tremendous amount of money"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"to take ""A Star is Born"" on the road."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Or I was thinking a weird corporate-private gig."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Or maybe it's a corporate-private gig,"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"but some of the tension in the film"
01:55:23;01:55:27;"is that Lady Gaga always wants to identify as Ali"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"'cause she's like, ""I can't sing these songs"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"""as Lady Gaga nor Stephanie Germanotta."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"""When I sing these songs, I'm Ali."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"""I gave a whole bunch of my life,"
01:55:35;01:55:38;"""and you're the one who inspired me to become Ali."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"""So when I sing in them, I'm Ali."""
01:55:39;01:55:41;"And she's always like, ""Well, hello there."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"""Wow, I can't believe it."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"""I'm still on my first album,"
01:55:45;01:55:49;"""and you guys already are showing so much respect for me."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"""My name is Ali."""
01:55:50;01:55:51;"And then he comes out and says,"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"""And my name is Bradley Cooper."""
01:55:53;01:55:54;"But then what happens?"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"They just play the song."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"It's like a screwball comedy."
01:55:56;01:56:00;"""I'm Ali, and I'm Bradley Cooper."""
01:56:00;01:56:01;"Something like that."
01:56:01;01:56:04;"Then they do, like, ""Tomato, tomato."""
01:56:04;01:56:04;"Exactly."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"A lot of them just in the car and in restaurants"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"arguing about it."
01:56:08;01:56:10;"I would love that, them just driving from gig to gig."
01:56:10;01:56:13;"That'd be tight, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in the car."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"She starts doing Ali, and she's like,"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"""Come on, do Jackson Maine."""
01:56:16;01:56:17;"""Not gonna do it."""
01:56:17;01:56:18;"""I'm not gonna do it."""
01:56:18;01:56:20;"That's Bradley's normal voice."
01:56:20;01:56:21;"""Stephanie, I'm not gonna do it."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"""My name is Ali."""
01:56:23;01:56:25;"""Stephanie, will you just calm down?"""
01:56:25;01:56:25;"""Jackson, you know what?"
01:56:25;01:56:26;"""Forget you."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"""You called me ugly."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"""How dare you?"
01:56:28;01:56:29;"""I hate you."""
01:56:29;01:56:31;"""I didn't call you ugly, Stephanie."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"""Relax."""
01:56:32;01:56:33;"""Oh, Jackson."""
01:56:34;01:56:35;"""All right."""
01:56:35;01:56:37;"And then he goes, ""You know, there could be some fun there."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"""There's fun to be had."""
01:56:38;01:56:40;"That's a 90-minute comedy."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"Yeah, definitely."
01:56:41;01:56:44;"Oh, I was thinking more like four and a half hour art film."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"I like that too."
01:56:45;01:56:48;"The real-time drive between Denver and Salt Lake City."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"Oh, yeah, one take."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"They have two giant corporate gigs,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"and for some reason, they're like Snowden or something,"
01:56:54;01:56:55;"and they're like,"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"""If you guys want this check, you're gonna have to drive."""
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Yeah."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Oh, it's eight hours."
01:57:00;01:57:02;"It's an eight-hour stage play."
01:57:02;01:57:07;"There's no PJ available, so you're driving, just the two of you."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Do you think that there's such big stars"
01:57:09;01:57:13;"that if you did a one-take, six-and-a-half-hour--"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Art film."
01:57:14;01:57:19;"Art film with just Lady Gaga and Cooper in character,"
01:57:19;01:57:22;"just talking on a road trip, that people would go see it?"
01:57:22;01:57:23;"Yeah."
01:57:23;01:57:26;"I bet if it was good, if it was as good as like the trip,"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"and I mean, they're both very talented,"
01:57:28;01:57:31;"but you know, Steve Coogan, that's like,"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"and Rob Brydon, that's really their bread and butter."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"You ever watch those movies, Alec?"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"The trip movies?"
01:57:35;01:57:35;"No."
01:57:35;01:57:38;"It's really like the English guys drive around"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"going to restaurants and just talking."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"It's one of those movies--"
01:57:42;01:57:43;"Doing Michael Caine impressions."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"Doing Michael Caine impressions."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Yeah."
01:57:45;01:57:48;"It's one of those movies that I think of so fondly,"
01:57:48;01:57:49;"but I could also imagine being like,"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"""Oh, you gotta watch the trip,"""
01:57:50;01:57:51;"and then somebody watches it and just be like,"
01:57:51;01:57:52;"""This sucked."""
01:57:52;01:57:52;"""It sucked."""
01:57:52;01:57:54;"I love all the trip movies."
01:57:54;01:57:54;"They're great."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Ariel is a huge trip head."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"That's tight."
01:57:57;01:58:00;"I think that even if things got a little awkward--"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"90 minutes of them just driving"
01:58:02;01:58:05;"would still be kind of like fascinating."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"We're talking six-hour art film though."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"Okay, but in the six-hour art film--"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"You cut it down to the 90."
01:58:10;01:58:13;"But what's a six-hour drive, SF to LA?"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Yeah, they hit the In-N-Out in Kettleman City."
01:58:15;01:58:16;"That might be more on point."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"It's like they're in San Francisco for something,"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"and then they have to get to--"
01:58:19;01:58:22;"So like weird tech conference."
01:58:22;01:58:23;"And the next night's the Oscars."
01:58:23;01:58:23;"We're finding it."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"Long story short, they have to drive."
01:58:25;01:58:28;"We'll get Tony Kushner to figure out that bullsh*t"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"when he sketches it out."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"I think with just the roughest outline"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"of the arc of what happens with them,"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"these two talented performers would just like"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"kind of fill it in."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"Okay, what do you think?"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Should we do, let's say another 45 on Bradley Cooper?"
01:58:42;01:58:47;"Just a real slow wrap up here."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"No, but he really is cool."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"I do respect."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Have you met him?"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"Yeah, I've met him here and there."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"I always thought he was super nice."
01:58:55;01:58:56;"What context did you meet him in?"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"You know, just see him around people that I know know him."
01:59:01;01:59:05;"And I always thought he seemed like a super mellow dude."
01:59:05;01:59:11;"Didn't seem like some weird superstar ego."
01:59:11;01:59:12;"Just actually seemed like a chill dude."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"And actually, I did feel bad for him"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"that he didn't get nominated for best director."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"That seemed a little unfair, didn't it?"
01:59:18;01:59:19;"Extremely unfair."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Let's get Bradley Cooper's whole filmography up"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"because I want to do another 45 on him."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Okay, that's enough time crisis."
01:59:25;01:59:27;"That's enough time crisis."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"Everybody needs to go."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"Everybody's probably excited to go have their little Oscars party."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"Put out some hummus and goldfish, invite the friends over."
01:59:34;01:59:36;"Have some fun."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"You said it like goldfish."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"Goldfish."
01:59:39;01:59:41;"Goldfish."
01:59:41;01:59:44;"Why not on Oscar night, they're goldfish."
01:59:44;01:59:46;"That's fair."
01:59:46;01:59:49;"Thanks to our East Coast ambassador,"
01:59:49;01:59:52;"president of TC East, Despot for coming through."
01:59:52;01:59:53;"You're welcome."
01:59:53;01:59:54;"That's the only person to thank."
01:59:54;01:59:57;"Me and Jake will see you in a couple of weeks."
01:59:57;01:59:57;"Yep."
01:59:57;01:59:58;"Peace."
01:59:58;02:00:01;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:00:01;02:00:08;"One."
