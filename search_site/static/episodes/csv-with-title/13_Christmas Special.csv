00:00;00:04;"It's early morning."
00:04;00:08;"Two men emerge from a Christmas mist."
00:08;00:14;"Me, Ezra Koenig, and poet/painter Jake Longstreth."
00:14;00:19;"We meet with hot chocolates in our hands and enter the Time Crisis studio, and we're going"
00:19;00:25;"to take phone calls from Rashida Jones, Alana Haim, and some fans."
00:25;00:27;"This is Time Crisis Christmas."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
05:08;05:11;"That was the kinks with Father Christmas."
05:11;05:13;"Thanks for coming over so early, Jake."
05:13;05:15;"Yeah, man. Tired."
05:15;05:17;"There are probably some people still up, listening."
05:17;05:19;"Yeah. I hope so."
05:19;05:21;"We're dedicated, so we're here."
05:21;05:22;"That's right."
05:22;05:23;"That song was pretty good."
05:23;05:24;"Yeah, that's a good one."
05:24;05:27;"That was kind of the kinks getting a little punky."
05:27;05:28;"Mm-hmm."
05:28;05:30;"Late '70s kinks."
05:30;05:35;"That's one of the few Christmas rock songs that has its own integrity."
05:35;05:38;"It's not just pure novelty."
05:38;05:43;"I could listen to that song, or I could hear that song any time of the year"
05:43;05:44;"and be like, ""Yeah, that's a good song."""
05:44;05:46;"Right. I know what you mean."
05:46;05:48;"Not all Christmas songs have integrity."
05:48;05:51;"You know what happens to me when people just make these trash Christmas songs"
05:51;05:52;"just to get something out?"
05:52;05:53;"Right."
05:53;05:55;"Or for just some random compilation or something?"
05:55;06:02;"You know what, to me, is the most integrity-possessing move?"
06:02;06:06;"Is when a Christmas song is just on your regular album."
06:06;06:07;"That is strong."
06:07;06:08;"You know what I mean?"
06:08;06:13;"Because it's not like Michael Buble, ""Okay, here's your Christmas album"
06:13;06:22;"that you're going to have at $6.99 at Target as a classic stocking stuffer."""
06:22;06:26;"It really shows that you have a love of Christmas, a love of Christianity,"
06:26;06:31;"when you actually put a Christmas song, just like track 7 on your album."
06:31;06:36;"The Everly Brothers, 1971 album, ""Stories We Tell Ourselves."""
06:36;06:39;"There's a song called ""Christmas Eve Can Kill You."""
06:39;06:40;"Whoa."
06:40;06:41;"Beautiful song."
06:41;06:43;"And that was not a Christmas album."
06:43;06:45;"Nope, straight-up album."
06:45;06:46;"Let's do it."
06:47;06:50;"Here's a Christmas song with some real integrity from the Everly Brothers,"
06:50;06:52;"""Christmas Eve Can Kill You."""

19:49;19:51;"That's a Christmas song with integrity."
19:51;19:56;"While we're here, I thought it was also a good time to reflect on the past year,"
19:56;19:58;"the past season of Time Crisis,"
19:58;20:02;"and maybe call some members of the Time Crisis family, people who have been on the show."
20:02;20:03;"Love it."
20:03;20:05;"That's what you're supposed to do, you know, wish people well."
20:05;20:13;"All right, so let's give a call to a multiple episode alum of Time Crisis, Rashida Jones."
20:13;20:15;"[phone ringing]"
20:15;20:17;"Hey, Rashida, you there?"
20:17;20:18;"I'm here."
20:18;20:20;"Happy holidays."
20:20;20:21;"Happy holidays."
20:21;20:22;"Sorry to call you so early."
20:22;20:23;"It's early."
20:23;20:25;"Yeah, what's up with that?"
20:25;20:30;"I think it's because we wanted English people to get to listen to the show."
20:30;20:31;"That's sweet."
20:31;20:33;"It's kind of a late night thing for the people in LA."
20:33;20:39;"So, Rashida, we were just talking about the fact that you're now part of Christmas history"
20:39;20:42;"because you appeared in a Christmas special."
20:42;20:45;"Do you want to call that Christmas-tory?"
20:45;20:47;"You're now part of Christmas-tory."
20:47;20:48;"Yeah."
20:48;20:50;"You've appeared in a Christmas special."
20:50;20:52;"You're like--you want to tell us about it?"
20:52;20:54;"It's the Bill Murray Christmas special."
20:54;20:59;"Yeah, I mean, I will say it definitely is a dream come true to be on a Christmas special."
20:59;21:06;"I watched a lot as a kid, obviously Charlie Brown, Bob Hope."
21:06;21:11;"You know, there's something really cozy about a Christmas special."
21:11;21:18;"And I feel Christmas special, having been in one, now that will live on forever,"
21:18;21:23;"especially because it's Bill Murray, who is--he's a man, you know?"
21:23;21:24;"He's a Christmas legend."
21:24;21:26;"Also, he appeared in Scrooged."
21:26;21:27;"Oh, yeah."
21:27;21:28;"That's right."
21:28;21:29;"That's a history with a holiday."
21:29;21:31;"Scrooged is a modern classic."
21:31;21:32;"Absolutely."
21:32;21:33;"Yeah."
21:33;21:36;"So you sang in the Bill Murray Christmas special."
21:36;21:38;"You and Jason Schwartzman sang a song."
21:38;21:39;"What song was it?"
21:39;21:45;"We sang ""I Saw the Light,"" which is a classic Todd Rundgren song."
21:45;21:47;"But not a Christmas song?"
21:47;21:53;"Not a Christmas song, but weirdly fits in well with the Christmas lexicon of music, I think."
21:53;21:58;"Well, I guess thanks to you and Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, it's now a Christmas song."
21:58;22:01;"So you want to introduce it to everybody listening at home?"
22:01;22:03;"I'd love that, yeah."
22:03;22:05;"Why not?"
22:05;22:06;"Oh, right now?"
22:06;22:07;"Please do it now."
22:07;22:08;"Yes, please."
22:08;22:09;"Thank you."
22:09;22:15;"This is the new Christmas classic, ""I Saw the Light,"" by Todd Rundgren."
22:23;22:31;"Because late last night I was feeling something wasn't right"
22:31;22:39;"There was not another soul in sight Only you, only you"
22:39;22:47;"So we walked along Though I knew that there was something wrong"
22:47;22:55;"And a feeling that feels so strong About you"
22:55;23:03;"Then you gazed up at me And the answer was plain to see"
23:03;23:11;"'Cause I saw the light in your eyes"
23:11;23:19;"In your eyes So behind all claims"
23:19;23:27;"I just never would suspect a thing So that little bell began to ring"
23:27;23:35;"In my head, in my head But I tried to run"
23:35;23:43;"Though I knew it wouldn't help me none 'Cause I couldn't ever love no one"
23:43;23:51;"But so I said But my feelings for you"
23:51;24:03;"Were just something I never knew 'Til I saw the light in your eyes"
24:03;24:07;"In your eyes"
24:23;24:31;"But I love you best It's not something that I say in jest"
24:31;24:39;"'Cause you're different though from all the rest In my eyes"
24:39;24:47;"And I ran out before But I won't do it anymore"
24:47;24:53;"Can't you see the light in my eyes?"
24:53;25:05;"In my eyes"
25:13;25:27;"When you've had enough of stalking on your own It's the time that every santa has a bone"
25:27;25:35;"Does he ride a reindeer? Does he turn upon his sleigh?"

27:09;27:16;"Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?"
27:16;27:23;"Do you ride off down the hillside in a bonnie you have made?"
27:23;27:30;"When you land upon your hand and you've been slain"

31:52;31:57;"We're having a reggae Christmas down in Jamaica"
31:57;32:01;"We're having a good time too"
32:01;32:06;"We're having a reggae Christmas"
32:06;32:12;"America brings out a reggae feel"
32:12;32:17;"We're having a reggae Christmas"
32:17;32:22;"We're having a good time too"
32:22;32:26;"We're having a reggae Christmas"
32:26;32:31;"America brings out a reggae feel"
32:37;32:40;"That was Brian Adams with ""Reggae Christmas."""
32:40;32:43;"Before that, we heard ""Christmas Time in the Mountains"""
32:43;32:46;"by Palace Songs, a.k.a. Will Oldham."
32:46;32:49;"And before that, we heard ""Merry Christmas, Everybody"""
32:49;32:52;"by Slade--1973, I want to say."
32:52;32:54;"You know that band, Ezra? Slade?"
32:54;32:56;"Yeah, they were like glam. Yeah."
32:56;32:57;"Glam rock."
32:57;33:00;"I think of them as like, kind of like"
33:00;33:03;"contemporaries of Kiss, but kind of better."
33:03;33:06;"And more British. Yeah."
33:06;33:08;"Yeah, and probably like Bowie too."
33:08;33:09;"Yeah, totally."
33:09;33:11;"I'm surprised Bowie didn't do a Christmas song."
33:11;33:12;"Maybe he did."
33:12;33:14;"Well, he did. I remember being a kid"
33:14;33:17;"and on like VH1 or something, they'd always show"
33:17;33:20;"like weird videos on Christmas,"
33:20;33:22;"and they would always show--"
33:22;33:24;"I don't know if it was like released on a record,"
33:24;33:28;"but they would show Bowie singing with Ben Crosby"
33:28;33:30;"on Ben Crosby's '70s Christmas special."
33:30;33:31;"Do you remember that?"
33:31;33:33;"Okay, no, I don't actually."
33:33;33:38;"And they did like a weird version of Little Drummer Boy."
33:38;33:39;"Huh."
33:39;33:43;"I meant like a Bowie-penned Christmas song."
33:43;33:45;"Seems like he might have done it."
33:45;33:46;"You know what? Okay."
33:46;33:48;"He didn't exactly write his own Christmas song,"
33:48;33:50;"but I think we could do a little Bowie Christmas block,"
33:50;33:52;"because he did sing Little Drummer Boy,"
33:52;33:56;"and then he does kind of like the spoken word bridge"
33:56;33:59;"of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"""
33:59;34:01;"By?"
34:01;34:03;"By all the--you remember like Bob Geldof"
34:03;34:05;"and everybody they did like the--"
34:05;34:06;"Oh, yeah."
34:06;34:09;"Okay, let's listen to Bowie singing"
34:09;34:11;"with Ben Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy,"
34:11;34:13;"and then let's get into Do They Know It's Christmas."
34:13;34:15;"That one bears some discussion."
34:15;34:20;"Hello."
34:20;34:22;"You the new butler?"
34:22;34:24;"It's been a long time since I've been the new anything."
34:24;34:26;"What's happened to Hudson?"
34:26;34:28;"I guess he's changing."
34:28;34:30;"He says that a lot, doesn't he?"
34:30;34:32;"I'm David Bowie. I live down the road."
34:32;34:35;"Sir Percival lets me use his piano when he's not around."
34:35;34:36;"He's not around, is he?"
34:36;34:38;"I can honestly say I haven't seen him,"
34:38;34:39;"but come on in."
34:39;34:40;"Come in."
34:40;34:42;"But come on in."
34:42;34:44;"Are you related to Sir Percival?"
34:44;34:45;"Well, distantly, yeah."
34:45;34:49;"Oh, you're not the poor relation from America, are you?"
34:49;34:52;"Gee, news sure travels fast, doesn't it?"
34:52;34:53;"I'm Bing."
34:53;34:55;"Oh, I'm pleased to meet you."
34:55;34:56;"You're the one that sings, right?"
34:56;34:58;"Right or wrong, I sing either way."
34:58;34:59;"Oh, I sing, too."
34:59;35:01;"Oh, good. What kind of singing?"
35:01;35:03;"Mostly the contemporary stuff."
35:03;35:05;"Do you like modern music?"
35:05;35:06;"Oh, I think it's marvellous."
35:06;35:08;"Some of it really fine."
35:08;35:11;"Tell me, you ever listen to any of the older fellows?"
35:11;35:13;"Oh, yeah, sure."
35:13;35:17;"I like John Lennon and the other one with Harry Nilsson."
35:17;35:19;"Oh, you go back that far, huh?"
35:19;35:21;"Oh, yeah. I'm not as young as I look."
35:21;35:23;"None of us is these days."
35:23;35:25;"In fact, I've got a six-year-old son,"
35:25;35:28;"and he really gets excited around the Christmas holiday thing."
35:28;35:30;"Do you go in for any of the traditional things"
35:30;35:32;"in the boy household Christmas town?"
35:32;35:34;"Oh, yeah, most of them, really."
35:34;35:37;"Presents, tree decorations,"
35:37;35:39;"agents sliding down the chimney."
35:39;35:40;"What?"
35:40;35:42;"I was just seeing if you were paying attention."
35:42;35:45;"Actually, our family do most of the things"
35:45;35:46;"that other families do."
35:46;35:47;"We sing the same songs."
35:47;35:48;"Do you?"
35:48;35:49;"I even have a go at White Christmas."
35:49;35:51;"You do, huh?"
35:51;35:52;"And this one."
35:52;35:53;"This is my son's favourite."
35:53;35:54;"Do you know this one?"
35:54;35:56;"Oh, I do indeed. It's a lovely thing."
35:56;36:17;"# Come, they told me, pa rum pa pum pum"
36:19;36:23;"# A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum"

38:29;38:33;"It's a pretty thing, isn't it?"

38:37;38:43;"# There's no need to be afraid"
38:43;38:47;"# At Christmas time"

38:53;38:58;"# And I'm sure you'll be there"
38:59;39:02;"# And we banish shade"
39:02;39:07;"# And in our world of plenty"
39:07;39:12;"# We can spread a smile of joy"
39:12;39:19;"# Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time"
39:19;39:23;"# But say a prayer"

39:36;39:41;"# There's a world outside your window"

39:45;39:49;"# Where a kiss of love can kill you"
39:49;39:54;"# And there's death in every tear"
39:55;39:58;"# And the Christmas bells that ring there"
39:58;40:02;"# Are the clanging chimes of doom"
40:02;40:10;"# Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you"
40:10;40:19;"# Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa"
40:21;40:26;"# A song of hope where there's no hope tonight"
40:26;40:33;"# Why is comfort deadly feared?"

40:51;40:55;"# Here's to them and all that is to come"
40:55;41:00;"# How can they know it's Christmas time at all?"
41:00;41:03;"# Freedom, whoa"
41:03;41:07;"# Let them know it's Christmas time"
41:07;41:11;"# Freedom, whoa"
41:11;41:16;"# Let them know it's Christmas time"

41:54;41:59;"# Let them know it's Christmas time"
41:59;42:03;"# Freedom, whoa #"
42:03;42:07;"So that was ""Band-Aid"" with ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"""
42:07;42:09;"You really never heard that song before, Jake?"
42:09;42:10;"Somehow that escaped me."
42:10;42:12;"That's one of the best-selling singles of all time."
42:12;42:13;"Really?"
42:13;42:17;"That's '84, which is the same year as ""We Are the World."""
42:17;42:19;"I think ""We Are the World"" was inspired by this."
42:19;42:20;"Oh, really?"
42:20;42:23;"""We Are the World"" is like the American ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"""
42:23;42:25;"Oh, maybe ""We Are the World"" is '85, then."
42:25;42:26;"It might be after."
42:26;42:30;"I think the story is Bob Geldof, lead singer of the Boomtown Rats,"
42:30;42:35;"wanted to do something, picked up the phone, got Bono, Sting..."
42:35;42:37;"Heavy hitters."
42:37;42:40;"The guy from Duran Duran, all in a room together."
42:40;42:41;"Boy George."
42:41;42:43;"Boy George, all the same. Bananarama."
42:43;42:45;"Maybe guys from ""Tears for Fears."""
42:45;42:47;"Probably some guys from ""Tears for Fears."""
42:47;42:50;"It raised a lot of money to feed the world,"
42:50;42:53;"notably certain nations in Africa that were starving."
42:53;42:56;"Although I think as time has gone on,"
42:56;42:58;"as much as people appreciate this song,"
42:58;43:01;"people feel a little weird about the sentiment."
43:01;43:02;"Why is that?"
43:02;43:05;"Because basically the idea of the song is"
43:05;43:08;"""Do They Know It's Christmas Time at All?"""
43:08;43:10;"So basically it's like,"
43:10;43:12;"""Don't you realize that we're here in England"
43:12;43:15;"having an incredible Christmas while it's snowing,"
43:15;43:19;"where in this place where these people are from,"
43:19;43:23;"the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears."
43:23;43:25;"Do they even know it's Christmas?"""
43:25;43:27;"So obviously there's a lot of assumptions happening."
43:27;43:29;"One is that these starving people..."
43:29;43:33;"If they believed in Jesus Christ, maybe everything would be okay."
43:33;43:37;"I'm sure Bob Geldof would be mortified for that interpretation."
43:37;43:42;"But I think back in 1984, people said uncomfortable things like that."
43:42;43:47;"There's a good-hearted, but maybe naive, sort of colonialist energy."
43:47;43:49;"Yes, very colonialist."
43:49;43:51;"""Do they even know it's Christmas?"""
43:51;43:52;"I mean, do they?"
43:52;43:54;"I mean, well, we should tell them."
43:54;43:56;"Let's write a song about it."
43:58;44:00;"I still find it a moving song, but it's like,"
44:00;44:02;"""Do they know it's Christmas?"""
44:02;44:04;"We know it's Christmas."
44:04;44:06;"Who cares if it's Christmas? Just feed the world."
44:06;44:08;"Feed the world is the important part."
44:08;44:11;"So then they took that ball and ran with it for ""We Are the World."""
44:11;44:14;"They were just like, ""You know what? It's the summer. Let's do this."""
44:14;44:16;"I think it was just the '80s."
44:16;44:19;"The first world is getting richer and richer."
44:19;44:20;"Yes, it's an interesting--"
44:20;44:23;"You got Reagan and Thatcher just crushing trade unions."
44:23;44:27;"A lot of money flowing upwards to the 1% of musicians."
44:27;44:30;"Oh, that's a weird time. I wonder what that's like."
44:30;44:33;"I can't even imagine."
44:33;44:36;"And then there's kind of like, ""You know what? Let's give back."""
44:36;44:37;"Yes."
44:37;44:42;"Our governments have been kind of destroying the social safety net."
44:42;44:44;"Why don't we give back a little bit?"
44:44;44:46;"But you know what? Hey, I'm not dissing the musicians."
44:46;44:47;"No."
44:47;44:50;"They definitely raise money for people."
44:50;44:53;"Okay, but I do need to say that I thought that David Bowie was on"
44:53;44:56;"""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" but he's actually on the B-side."
44:56;44:58;"I own this seven-inch single."
44:58;45:02;"I want to play you the part where Bowie does this weird spoken word."
45:02;45:04;"Almost like his part in ""Under Pressure."""
45:04;45:06;"Bowie's got a great talking voice."
45:06;45:12;"Okay, so this is the extended mix of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"""
45:12;45:15;"I guess they got so many people wanted to be on the song"
45:15;45:17;"that they couldn't-- there are too many stars."
45:17;45:21;"And I vividly remember listening to this version and hearing Bowie talk."
45:21;45:22;"England right now is pumped."
45:22;45:23;"Okay, here it is."
45:23;45:25;"This is David Bowie."
45:25;45:28;"It's Christmas 1984."
45:28;45:32;"And there are more starving folk on that planet than ever before."
45:32;45:35;"Please give a thought for them this season and do whatever you can,"
45:35;45:38;"however small, to help them live."
45:38;45:40;"Have a peaceful New Year."
45:40;45:44;"This record was recorded on the 25th of November 1984."
45:44;45:47;"It's now 8 a.m. in the morning of the 26th."
45:47;45:49;"We've been here 24 hours and I think--"
45:49;45:50;"This is super weird."
45:50;45:54;"Okay, so obviously David Bowie and Paul McCartney and all these guys"
45:54;45:57;"were basically just mailing in their recording."
45:57;45:59;"They were like, ""We can't make the real session,"
45:59;46:01;"but we'll record something for the B-side."""
46:01;46:04;"Let's go back and listen to that Bowie clearly recording it--"
46:04;46:06;"I mean, this is 1984, so people don't have phones."
46:06;46:10;"This sounds like he recorded it on his phone outdoors."
46:10;46:11;"Please give a thought for them this season--"
46:11;46:12;"You hear all that--"
46:12;46:13;"The echo?"
46:13;46:14;"And all that ambient noise?"
46:14;46:15;"Road noise?"
46:15;46:16;"Yeah."
46:16;46:18;"Bowie's just like driving."
46:18;46:22;"This record was recorded on the 25th of November 1984."
46:22;46:24;"Whatever, still a classic song."
46:24;46:27;"And probably that song is still raising money for--"
46:27;46:28;"Really?"
46:28;46:30;"I don't know, for starving people?"
46:30;46:33;"I always wonder about that when you buy some old album"
46:33;46:38;"and there's correspondence to the fan club at this random address"
46:38;46:40;"that was there 30 years ago, and you're like,"
46:40;46:42;"""What would happen if you sent it there?"""
46:42;46:45;"So I mean, if someone buys that song on iTunes,"
46:45;46:49;"I doubt there's some sort of fund that's still active."
46:49;46:51;"Well, somebody's getting paid for it."
46:51;46:52;"Oh, I bet there is."
46:52;46:54;"That would be a real travesty."
46:54;46:56;"Because you could buy this song on iTunes."
46:56;46:59;"If we found out that that money was not going to starving people,"
46:59;47:01;"that'd be a crime against humanity."
47:01;47:03;"Apple's in hot water now, dude."
47:03;47:05;"Well, no, that's not on Apple."
47:05;47:07;"Well, if you bought it on iTunes."
47:07;47:10;"Yeah, but it's on the record company or whoever released it."
47:10;47:12;"That is such a This American Life."
47:12;47:13;"Right."
47:13;47:15;"Band-Aid, ""Duly Notes Christmas,"""
47:15;47:17;"one of the best-selling singles of all time."
47:17;47:19;"It released in 1984."
47:19;47:25;"It raised over $40 million for people suffering from the famines of the '80s."
47:25;47:28;"However, as the song--"
47:28;47:31;"[laughter]"
47:31;47:33;"However, I bought the song the other day"
47:33;47:36;"to listen to with my wife and child,"
47:36;47:40;"and I could not but wonder, ""Where's the money going now?"""
47:40;47:45;"And then it's like 40 minutes of phone calls to lawyers,"
47:45;47:47;"dodging questions."
47:47;47:48;"Oh, man."
47:48;47:51;"So it turns out that one and a half cents goes to Africa."
47:51;47:53;"Really makes you think."
47:53;47:54;"Merry Christmas, everybody."
47:54;47:56;"Merry Christmas, everybody."
47:56;47:58;"Let's just--you know, everybody, you know, do your research."
47:58;48:02;"Anytime you give to charity, you gotta do your due diligence."
48:02;48:04;"And that includes when you buy a charitable single."
48:04;48:06;"That's 30 years old."
48:06;48:10;"Especially one that's 30 years old."
48:10;48:12;"You know, it's not exactly a Christmas song,"
48:12;48:16;"but we've been talking about that was the British big charity single of the '80s,"
48:16;48:18;"the big American charity single of the '80s,"
48:18;48:20;"put together by Rashida's dad."
48:20;48:21;"""We Are the World,"" right?"
48:21;48:22;"""We Are the World."""
48:22;48:23;"Yeah."
48:23;48:24;"I mean, we're American. I think we might as well play that."
48:24;48:25;"Let's go for it, yeah."
48:25;48:27;"It's fitting for Christmas."
48:27;48:28;"""We Are the World."""
48:30;48:33;"USA for Africa, ""We Are the World."""
48:33;48:34;"Now, in this song, we're gonna hear--"
48:34;48:37;"It was solid eight minutes."
48:37;48:39;"It's exactly eight minutes."
48:39;48:40;"[laughs]"
48:46;48:47;"Who starts it, MJ?"
48:55;48:56;"Okay."
48:56;48:57;"Gucci."
49:11;49:12;"Paul Simon."
49:21;49:22;"Loggins."
49:22;49:23;"No, that's Kenny Rogers, dude."
49:23;49:24;"[laughs]"
49:24;49:25;"Rogers."
49:30;49:33;"Is that Teddy?"
49:33;49:34;"Ooh, Tina."
49:34;49:36;"Ooh, she sounds great."
49:40;49:42;"Billy."
49:42;49:44;"Joel, like a couple years past his prime."
49:50;49:52;"Jake and I are watching the video."
49:52;49:57;"We gotta point out that Michael is wearing his full shiny socks."
49:57;49:58;"Classic look."
49:58;50:01;"Military look."
50:01;50:06;"The way they panned on Michael, they started at his shoes and panned up his entire body."
50:20;50:21;"Dion."
50:27;50:28;"Willie is so distinctive."
50:31;50:33;"Wow."
50:33;50:36;"Willie is one of those dudes that's always been old."
50:36;50:37;"Yeah."
50:37;50:39;"I mean, is he in his 80s?"
50:39;50:40;"Yeah."
50:40;50:41;"That's incredible."
50:41;50:42;"Oh, yeah."
50:42;50:43;"Bruce at his prime."
50:50;50:52;"That's Loggins."
50:52;50:53;"Oh, is it?"
50:53;50:55;"Yeah, that's Loggins."
50:55;50:56;"Ooh."
50:56;50:57;"[laughs]"
50:57;50:58;"Steve Perry."
51:04;51:05;"Daryl."
51:05;51:06;"Okay."
51:12;51:14;"MJ's got shades on."
51:27;51:28;"Lopper."
51:57;51:58;"[laughs]"
51:58;51:59;"Oh, God."
52:00;52:01;"The man."
52:01;52:02;"All right, that's enough."
52:02;52:03;"We made it to Dylan."
52:03;52:04;"[laughs]"
52:05;52:06;"Oh, my God."
52:26;52:27;"[laughs]"
52:27;52:28;"We made it to Dylan."
52:36;52:42;"If we make it through December,"
52:42;52:48;"Everything's gonna be all right, I know."
52:48;52:53;"It's the coldest time of winter,"
52:53;52:59;"And I shiver when I see the falling snow."
52:59;53:04;"If we make it through December,"
53:04;53:11;"Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime,"
53:11;53:16;"Maybe even California."
53:16;53:22;"If we make it through December, we'll be fine."
53:22;53:27;"Got laid off down at the factory,"
53:27;53:33;"And their time is not the greatest in the world."
53:33;53:39;"Heaven knows I've been working hard."
53:39;53:45;"I wanted Christmas to be right for Daddy's girl."
53:45;53:51;"I don't mean to hit December."
53:51;53:57;"It's meant to be the happiest time of year."
53:57;54:02;"But my little girl don't understand"
54:02;54:08;"Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas here."
54:08;54:14;"If we make it through December,"
54:14;54:20;"Everything's gonna be all right, I know."
54:20;54:25;"It's the coldest time of winter,"
54:25;54:31;"And I shiver when I see the falling snow."
54:31;54:37;"If we make it through December,"
54:37;54:43;"Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime,"
54:43;54:48;"Maybe even California."
54:48;54:54;"If we make it through December, we'll be fine."
54:54;55:12;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
55:12;55:15;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
55:15;55:18;"It's not the way I had him pictured."
55:18;55:21;"Santa was much too thin."
55:21;55:24;"He didn't come down the chimney,"
55:24;55:27;"So Mama must have let him in."
55:27;55:30;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
55:30;55:33;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
55:33;55:36;"Well, they thought I was fast asleep,"
55:36;55:39;"And they thought I was tucked in bed."
55:39;55:42;"They never thought that I'd come a-peepin',"
55:42;55:45;"Or that I'd hear what was said."
55:45;55:48;"Santa put his arm around Mama,"
55:48;55:51;"And Mama put her arm around him."
55:51;55:54;"So if Santa Claus ain't Daddy,"
55:54;55:57;"Then I'm a-gonna tell on them."
55:57;56:00;"Well, Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
56:00;56:03;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:03;56:06;"It's not the way I had him pictured."
56:06;56:09;"Santa was much too thin."
56:09;56:12;"He didn't come down the chimney,"
56:12;56:15;"So Mama must have let him in."
56:15;56:18;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
56:18;56:21;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:21;56:29;"I never saw a dancer, a prancer,"
56:29;56:32;"I never heard the sleigh bells ring."
56:32;56:35;"I never saw the red-nosed reindeer,"
56:35;56:38;"Like they show on the TV screen."
56:38;56:41;"But he sure brought a lot of presents,"
56:41;56:44;"So Santa Claus he must have been."
56:44;56:47;"Well, he sure looked a lot like Daddy,"
56:47;56:50;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:50;56:53;"Well, Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
56:53;56:56;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:56;56:59;"It's not the way I had him pictured."
56:59;57:02;"Santa was much too thin."
57:02;57:05;"He didn't come down the chimney,"
57:05;57:08;"So Mama must have let him in."
57:08;57:11;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"
57:11;57:14;"Our Daddy looked a lot like him."
57:14;57:25;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
57:25;57:30;"Last year I hung my stocking by the chimney,"
57:30;57:35;"And old Santa didn't bring me anything."
57:35;57:40;"Well, I wrote a note and I told him what to bring me,"
57:40;57:45;"But I didn't even hear his sleigh bells ring."
57:45;57:50;"So to heck with old Santa Claus."
57:50;57:55;"When he goes dashing through the snow, I hope he falls."
57:55;57:58;"I'd like to hit him in his hole, hole, hole,"
57:58;58:01;"With a bunch of big snowballs."
58:01;58:05;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
58:25;58:30;"This year I'll build a big fire in the far place,"
58:30;58:35;"I'll be like the little pig I read about."
58:35;58:40;"If that big bad wolf in red comes down my chimney,"
58:40;58:45;"He's a-gonna scorch his whiskers, there's no doubt."
58:45;58:50;"So to heck with old Santa Claus."
58:50;58:56;"When he goes dashing through the snow, I hope he falls."
58:56;58:59;"I'd like to hit him in his hole, hole, hole,"
58:59;59:02;"With a bunch of big snowballs."
59:02;59:06;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
59:06;59:11;"Yeah, to heck with old Santa Claus."
59:12;59:14;"That was a little country set."
59:14;59:16;"Finishing up with Loretta Lynn."
59:16;59:18;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
59:18;59:20;"I love a nice country Christmas."
59:20;59:23;"Jake, what's your favorite Christmas movie?"
59:23;59:25;"Sorry to put you on the spot, man."
59:25;59:27;"Um, that's a tough one, dude."
59:27;59:29;"Well, first of all, I told you before,"
59:29;59:31;"you're not allowed to say Die Hard anymore."
59:31;59:32;"I know."
59:32;59:35;"I mean, Die Hard used to be the quote-unquote"
59:35;59:38;"""cool"" answer to that question."
59:38;59:39;"Yeah, now it's not cool."
59:39;59:41;"We're self-conscious."
59:41;59:43;"Yeah, too many people have said it."
59:43;59:46;"I'll say this, that's the great L.A. Christmas movie."
59:46;59:48;"Yeah, not a lot of L.A. Christmas movies."
59:48;59:50;"That is very specific."
59:50;59:55;"That is Christmas Eve, L.A., '87."
59:55;59:56;"Right."
59:56;59:58;"Film released in '88."
59:58;01:00:02;"So I assume, you know, in the fictional timeline, it was '87."
01:00:02;01:00:07;"Right, so that was about contemporaneous"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"with the events of Straight Outta Compton."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"Yes, and the Bernie Sanders album."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"Right."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"But this is in L.A."
01:00:15;01:00:19;"So in L.A., John McClane was doing all that nonsense."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Right."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"And what is it called, Nakatomi Plaza?"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"Nakatomi Plaza."
01:00:23;01:00:28;"Meanwhile, South Central, you know, sees Straight Outta Compton."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Yeah."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"So what's your favorite Christmas movie?"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"Well, I mean, I kind of struggle with it."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"It's a little bit like Christmas songs."
01:00:34;01:00:43;"I mean, most of them are so novel and sort of done only for that specific day"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"that they don't have any integrity."
01:00:45;01:00:52;"Okay, name one Christmas movie with integrity besides Die Hard."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"No, see, I wanted to say Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"but that's Thanksgiving."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"Good catch."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Do you have one?"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I mean, honestly."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I'm drawn."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"All right, if I'm honest."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Oh, Scrooge."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"All right, Scrooge is good."
01:01:05;01:01:09;"If I'm honest, even though it's a very problematic film,"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"the Christmas movie I've watched the most that influenced my vision"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"of what Christmas is is Home Alone."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Word."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"I mean, I've just seen it a billion times."
01:01:20;01:01:26;"Like the music, we've been playing a lot today as we speak."
01:01:26;01:01:31;"The music, the atmosphere, just the ultraviolence against home intruders,"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"all of that was very influential to me as a child."
01:01:35;01:01:39;"But, you know, one thing that bothered me about it is that my PC police,"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"liberal, nonviolent parents always gave me a hard time about it."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"Really?"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"My mom would always see me watching and be like, ""This movie is disgusting."""
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Are you serious?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Yeah, no, she really thought the violence wasn't funny."
01:01:50;01:01:56;"And I was like, ""Mom, Joe Pesci's head just got lit on fire by a blowtorch."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"It's funny."""
01:01:57;01:02:00;"What was the other guy--I was like, ""Daniel Stern just stepped on a nail."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"It's funny."""
01:02:01;01:02:03;"And she would always say, ""No, this is not funny,"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"and I don't know why this is children's entertainment."""
01:02:05;01:02:08;"That's why I moved out."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"Parents just don't understand."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"Anyway, back into some Christmas music."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"We were talking before about Christmas songs with integrity,"
01:02:15;01:02:19;"Christmas songs that are on regular albums,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"not waiting for the Christmas stocking stuffer rush."
01:02:22;01:02:29;"And one of the best of all time has got to be the Pogues' Fairy Tale of New York."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"Which was on a regular Pogues album."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"And that made me think a little bit about how much I love Irish music"
01:02:35;01:02:40;"and how even non-Christmas Irish music has a bit of Christmas in it."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"That's just--I don't know why I think that."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"But anyway, let's kick things off with the Pogues' Fairy Tale of New York"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"and then listen to a little bit of Irish music."
01:07:04;01:07:07;"That was the Pogues' Fairy Tale of New York."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"Beautiful Christmas song."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Yeah, that's awesome."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"I love that song."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"It's like one of those Christmas carols that you hear in the movies and stuff."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"In the film Basquiat."
01:07:18;01:07:23;"It's interesting to write a melody that somehow evokes that sort of classic"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Christmas feeling."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"Right."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"You know what I mean?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Yeah, yeah."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"It's very anthemic."
01:07:29;01:07:33;"[singing]"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"It sounds Christmassy."
01:07:34;01:07:40;"I feel that way about that John Lennon song, ""Happy Christmas, War is Over."""
01:07:40;01:07:43;"Now let's listen to some non-Christmas Irish music, but it still kind of is"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"stirring in a way."
01:07:45;01:07:48;"When we come out of this block, this rock block of Irish music, we're going to"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"take some Christmas phone calls from the fans."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Sweet."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"Opening up the floodgates for the first time on Tom Crisis."
01:07:54;01:08:00;"To kick things off, here's Johnny Cash with his stirring rendition of Danny Boy."
01:08:00;01:08:10;"[singing]"
01:08:10;01:08:20;"From glen to glen and down the mountainside."
01:08:20;01:08:28;"The summer's gone and all the roses fallen."
01:08:28;01:08:38;"It's you, it's you, must go and I must bide."
01:08:38;01:08:47;"But come ye back when summer's in the meadow."
01:08:47;01:08:56;"Or when the valley's lush and white with snow."
01:08:56;01:09:06;"I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow."
01:09:06;01:09:18;"Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so."
01:09:18;01:09:26;"But if you come and all the flowers are dying."
01:09:26;01:09:35;"And I am dead, as dead I will may be."
01:09:35;01:09:44;"You'll come and find the place where I am lying."
01:09:44;01:09:54;"And kneel and say, and obey there for me."
01:09:54;01:10:03;"And I will know, though soft ye tread above me."
01:10:03;01:10:12;"And then my grave will richer, sweeter be."
01:10:12;01:10:23;"And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me."
01:10:23;01:10:34;"And I will rest in peace until you come to me."
01:11:04;01:11:17;"What did I have, said the fine old woman."
01:11:17;01:11:30;"What did I have, this proud old woman did say."
01:11:30;01:11:43;"I had four green fields, each one was a jewel."
01:11:43;01:11:56;"But strangers came and tried to take them from me."
01:11:56;01:12:10;"But my fine strong sons, they fought to save my jewels."
01:12:10;01:12:28;"They fought and they died, and that was my grief, said she."
01:12:28;01:12:41;"Long time ago, said the fine old woman."
01:12:41;01:12:54;"Long time ago, this proud old woman did say."
01:12:54;01:13:08;"There was war and death, plundering and pillage."
01:13:08;01:13:21;"My children starved by mountain, valley and stream."
01:13:21;01:13:35;"And their wailing cries, they reached the very heavens."
01:13:35;01:13:54;"And my four green fields ran red with their blood, said she."
01:13:54;01:14:07;"What have I now, said the fine old woman."
01:14:07;01:14:20;"What have I now, this proud old woman did say."
01:14:20;01:14:34;"I have four green fields, one of them's in bondage."
01:14:34;01:14:48;"In strangers' hands, that tried to take it from me."
01:14:48;01:15:02;"But my sons of sons, as brave as were their fathers."
01:15:02;01:15:16;"And my four green fields will bloom once again, said she."
01:15:16;01:15:34;"And my four green fields will bloom once again, said she."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"[APPLAUSE]"

01:18:37;01:18:42;"Forget the same as the rebel Jesus."
01:18:42;01:18:50;"But please forgive me if I seem to take the tone of judgment."
01:18:50;01:18:58;"For I've no wish to come between this day and your enjoyment."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"In this life of hardship and of earthly toil,"
01:19:02;01:19:06;"we have need for anything that frees us."
01:19:06;01:19:10;"So I preach you pleasure and I bid you cheer"
01:19:10;01:19:16;"from a heathen and a pagan."
01:19:16;01:19:20;"On the side of the rebel Jesus."
01:19:20;01:19:26;"That was a Christmas song by the Chieftains and Jackson Brown"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"called ""The Rebel Jesus."""
01:19:28;01:19:31;"And now we have our first caller for a Time Crisis Christmas chat."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"This is Alice. Where are you calling from, Alice?"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"I'm from Champaign, Illinois."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"Do you celebrate Christmas?"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Yeah, I do, actually."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"What's a typical Christmas like for you?"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"Oh, nothing too special. I just stay home in Champaign."
01:19:44;01:19:48;"All my family is actually in California or in China."
01:19:48;01:19:53;"So we actually don't do a lot of traveling for the holidays."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"What's going on in China?"
01:19:55;01:19:58;"My parents are actually from there."
01:19:58;01:20:01;"And I'm studying abroad there next semester, so I'm really excited."
01:20:01;01:20:06;"Oh, nice. Do you have a Christmas message you'd like to wish to the world?"
01:20:06;01:20:10;"Oh, happy holidays. I don't really know what to say."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"You celebrate Hanukkah, right, Ezra?"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"Yeah, I celebrate Hanukkah a little bit."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Oh, how was that for you this year?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"It was pretty laid back."
01:20:19;01:20:24;"It lacked some of the emotional gravitas of Christmas, but it was good."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"We had some latkes and lit the menorah."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Well, thanks for calling, Alice. We're going to take some more calls."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Okay, nice talking to you."
01:20:30;01:20:32;"[phone ringing]"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"Hello?"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Hi, who are we talking to?"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Uh, Caitlin."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"Hey, Caitlin. Welcome to Time Crisis."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Thank you for having me."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"Where are you calling from, Caitlin?"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Fort Lauderdale, Florida."
01:20:45;01:20:48;"Oh, so what's Christmas like in Fort Lauderdale?"
01:20:48;01:20:58;"Um, warm, and there's a lot of palm trees decorated with lights, but not much else in means of Christmas."
01:20:58;01:21:02;"Uh, Caitlin, what's your favorite Christmas song?"
01:21:02;01:21:08;"My favorite Christmas song is, um, what's it called?"
01:21:08;01:21:12;"The Bruce Springsteen version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Oh, tight. The live version?"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Strong choice."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Yeah."
01:21:15;01:21:20;"Okay, we're going to listen to that right now. So thanks for your pick, Caitlin."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Thank you for having me, Ezra. You're the best."
01:21:22;01:21:25;"You're the best. Here's Bruce Springsteen."
01:21:30;01:21:34;"It's all cold down along the beach."
01:21:34;01:21:39;"The wind's whipping down the boardwalk."
01:21:39;01:21:44;"And man, you guys know what time of year it is."
01:21:44;01:21:48;"What time? What? What?"
01:21:48;01:21:51;"Oh, Christmas time."
01:21:51;01:21:56;"You guys all been good and practicing real hard? Yeah?"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"Clients, you've been rehearsing real hard now?"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"So Santa, bring your new saxophone, right?"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"Everybody out there been good or what?"
01:22:05;01:22:10;"Oh, that's not many. Not many of you guys in trouble out here."
01:22:13;01:22:17;"And you better watch out. You better not cry."
01:22:17;01:22:22;"You better not fight. I'm telling you why."
01:22:22;01:22:26;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:22:26;01:22:29;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:22:29;01:22:37;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"He's making a list. He's checking it twice."
01:22:41;01:22:45;"He's gonna find out who's blowing ice."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:22:53;01:23:00;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:23:00;01:23:04;"He sees you when you're sleeping."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"He knows when you're awake."
01:23:08;01:23:12;"He knows if you've been bad or good."
01:23:12;01:23:18;"You better be good for goodness sake."
01:23:18;01:23:23;"Oh, you better watch out. You better not cry."
01:23:23;01:23:27;"You better not pout. I'm telling you why."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:23:33;01:23:38;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"He sees you when you're sleeping."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"He knows when you're awake."
01:24:06;01:24:10;"He knows if you've been bad or good."
01:24:10;01:24:16;"You better be good for goodness sake."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"You better watch out. You better not cry."
01:24:20;01:24:24;"You better not pout. I'm telling you why."
01:24:24;01:24:28;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:31;01:24:36;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:53;01:24:57;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:24:57;01:25:00;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:00;01:25:04;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:07;01:25:11;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:11;01:25:14;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:26;01:25:30;"Santa Claus is coming to town."
01:25:48;01:25:54;"Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind."
01:25:54;01:26:00;"Run, run Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind."
01:26:00;01:26:06;"Run, run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town."
01:26:06;01:26:12;"Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down."
01:26:12;01:26:18;"Run, run Rudolph, 'cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round."
01:26:18;01:26:25;"Say it Santa to a boy child, what have you been longing for?"
01:26:25;01:26:31;"All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar."
01:26:31;01:26:38;"And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a shooting star."
01:26:38;01:26:44;"Run, run Rudolph, Santa's have to make it in town."
01:26:44;01:26:50;"Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down."
01:26:50;01:26:55;"Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round."
01:27:16;01:27:22;"Run, run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town."
01:27:22;01:27:28;"Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down."
01:27:28;01:27:34;"Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round."
01:27:34;01:27:41;"Say it Santa to a girl child, what would please you most to get?"
01:27:41;01:27:47;"A little baby doll that can cry asleep drinking wet."
01:27:47;01:27:53;"And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a saber jet."
01:27:53;01:28:00;"Run, run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town."
01:28:00;01:28:06;"Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"That was Chuck Berry with Run Rudolph Run."
01:28:19;01:28:23;"We're going to keep making phone calls to members of the Time Crisis family."
01:28:23;01:28:29;"One of our newest additions who came on the last episode of Time Crisis was Alana Babyheim."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Alana, are you there?"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"I'm part of the Time Crisis family?"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"Yeah, now you are."
01:28:36;01:28:38;"I am so honored."
01:28:38;01:28:41;"The show that you were on two weeks ago was a big hit."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Was it?"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I don't know, I mean people liked it."
01:28:45;01:28:49;"I feel like I had major word vomit, so I had a lot of fun though."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"No, no, no, never censor yourself."
01:28:52;01:28:58;"Alana, I know that you, like myself, are a Hebrew, but that doesn't mean we don't love Christmas."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"What does Christmas mean to you as a non-Christian?"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"I actually celebrated Christmas."
01:29:04;01:29:09;"I mean, growing up, I feel like the Hanukkah song really explains it."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"It kind of feels a little weird for a Jew on Christmas."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"It's a little weird."
01:29:14;01:29:20;"When the Hanukkah song came out, it gave us life, but I never really got to have the whole"
01:29:20;01:29:30;"Christmas tree, presents, cookies, Santa, like I never really got to do it until last year."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Only last year?"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Only last year."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"What changed?"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"I know."
01:29:34;01:29:39;"My friend was like, I don't know, maybe people just don't invite me to their parties."
01:29:39;01:29:45;"I was never invited to a full-blown Christmas party until last year."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"I guess I've been on tour for a while."
01:29:47;01:29:51;"I guess that'll be the excuse that I'm going to use for myself."
01:29:51;01:29:58;"But I went to a Christmas party, and let me tell you, it was the f***ing best thing I've"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"ever been a part of."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"It was just such a happy time."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I bet it smelled real good, right?"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"It smelled good."
01:30:05;01:30:09;"It smelled like pine and gingerbread cookies."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"Everyone was happy."
01:30:12;01:30:14;"There was crazy amounts of food."
01:30:14;01:30:19;"We did this thing called the, is it called the White Elephant?"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Does that ring a bell?"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Oh, it's like a gift-giving game?"
01:30:22;01:30:26;"Yeah, a gift-giving game where you give bad gifts."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"Like, funny gifts."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Ones that make you like, ""Lol."""
01:30:29;01:30:34;"Like, someone got a Christmas sweater that said something stupid on it."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"I don't know."
01:30:35;01:30:39;"I think I got some tongs."
01:30:39;01:30:43;"Like, if you're making something in the kitchen, you have tongs."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"I don't know."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"That's a very thoughtful, useful gift, actually."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"Nothing funny about that."
01:30:47;01:30:48;"It is a very useful gift."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"But it was just such a merry party."
01:30:51;01:30:55;"I hope I'm invited to another one this year."
01:30:55;01:31:00;"Alana, Jake and I are both going to pray that you get invited to a Christmas party,"
01:31:00;01:31:03;"despite the fact that you've only been to one Christmas in your life."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"I hope so."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"Everybody pray for me."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"All right, Alana."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy New Year, and we'll see you in 2016."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Thanks, Ezra."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Hi, my name is Alana ""Baby"" Haim,"
01:31:14;01:31:19;"and my favorite Christmas song is the Hanukkah song by Adam Sandler."
01:31:24;01:31:25;"Okay."
01:31:25;01:31:29;"This is a song that--there's a lot of Christmas songs out there,"
01:31:29;01:31:32;"and not too many Hanukkah songs."
01:31:32;01:31:36;"So I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"who don't get to hear any Hanukkah songs."
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Here we go."
01:31:45;01:31:51;"Put on your yarmulke, here comes Hanukkah."
01:31:51;01:31:58;"So much Hanukkah to celebrate Hanukkah."
01:31:58;01:32:06;"Hanukkah is a festival of lights."
01:32:06;01:32:15;"Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights."
01:32:15;01:32:22;"And you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree."
01:32:22;01:32:35;"Here's a list of people who are Jewish, just like you and me."
01:32:35;01:32:40;"David Lee Roth lights the menorah."
01:32:40;01:32:45;"So do James Conkirk Douglas and the late Dinah Shorah."
01:32:45;01:32:51;"Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli?"
01:32:51;01:32:57;"Bowser from ""Shah-nah-nah"" and Arthur Fonzarelli."
01:32:57;01:33:03;"Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Put them together."
01:33:05;01:33:11;"What a fine-looking Jew."
01:33:11;01:33:16;"You don't need Dechter Halls or Jingle Bell Rock"
01:33:16;01:33:23;"'cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, both Jewish."
01:33:23;01:33:28;"Put on your yarmulke, it's time for Hanukkah."
01:33:28;01:33:34;"The owner of the Seattle Supersonicas celebrates Hanukkah."
01:33:34;01:33:43;"O.J. Simpson, not a Jew."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"But guess who is?"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Hall of Famer Rod Carew."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"He converted."
01:33:49;01:33:55;"We got Ann Landers and her sister, dear Abby."
01:33:55;01:34:02;"Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish, not too shabby."
01:34:02;01:34:07;"Some people think that Ebeneezer Scrooge is."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Well, he's not, but guess who is?"
01:34:09;01:34:15;"All three Stooges."
01:34:15;01:34:20;"So many Jews are in showbiz."
01:34:20;01:34:25;"Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is."
01:34:25;01:34:30;"Tell your friend Veronica it's time to celebrate Hanukkah."
01:34:30;01:34:35;"Hope I get a harmonica on this lovely, lovely Hanukkah."
01:34:35;01:34:40;"So drink your gin and tonica and smoke your marijuana."
01:34:40;01:34:47;"If you really, really want to go, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Hanukkah."
01:34:47;01:34:53;"Happy Hanukkah."
01:34:53;01:34:57;"That was Alana Himes' Christmas pick, being a little cheeky,"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"choosing the Hanukkah song by Adam Sandler."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"Remember that song, Jake?"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"Oh, yeah."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"That was a big one."
01:35:02;01:35:03;"Yeah, classic."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"On the radio."
01:35:04;01:35:09;"I met Adam Sandler at a Christmas party for the first time out here in Hollywood."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Wow."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Just this past week."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"What was he like?"
01:35:12;01:35:17;"I don't want, obviously I respect Mr. Sandler's work a lot,"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"or the work that I'm familiar with,"
01:35:19;01:35:24;"so I don't want to blow up his spot too much by talking anything about him personally."
01:35:24;01:35:27;"But one thing people have always told me about Adam Sandler"
01:35:27;01:35:34;"is that he famously never dresses up and that on set he's always just a T-shirt and sweatpants,"
01:35:34;01:35:38;"really hates fashion, really doesn't care."
01:35:38;01:35:42;"And I was like, okay, I guess that just means he's kind of a casual guy on set."
01:35:42;01:35:48;"So then I get to this Christmas party at a beautiful home in the Pacific Palisades,"
01:35:48;01:35:56;"and really it was like a storybook, like kind of fancy Christmas."
01:35:56;01:35:57;"Yeah."
01:35:57;01:36:09;"A lot of middle-aged men in cashmere half-zips, blazers, women dressed in real elegant dresses."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"A fancy Hollywood Christmas party."
01:36:11;01:36:12;"A fancy Hollywood Christmas party."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Honey ham."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"Absolutely."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Honey ham on deck."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Multiple hams."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"A big, beautiful Christmas tree and a fire."
01:36:20;01:36:26;"And so I'm at the Christmas party just looking around, beautiful."
01:36:26;01:36:30;"You know, like the banister has like the, you know, the halls are decked."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"Can you disclose whose house this was?"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"No, no, I don't want to say."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"Okay."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"I don't want to say."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Top secret."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"Because they didn't invite me directly anyway."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"I got you."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"I was a plus one."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"Okay."
01:36:40;01:36:41;"And so everybody's dressed up real nice."
01:36:41;01:36:44;"I was wearing like a teddy bear sweater and a blazer,"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"and even then I felt like, oh, maybe I should have tried a little harder."
01:36:46;01:36:50;"And then I'm talking to somebody and I just hear a head stick around a corner"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"and go, yeah."
01:36:52;01:36:56;"And the host of the party looks over and is like, oh, Adam,"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"walks over to say hi to him and I see them talking."
01:36:58;01:37:07;"And Adam Sandler truly was so far below the, like, dress code of the party."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"It was incredible."
01:37:09;01:37:13;"Sweatpants, really old T-shirt,"
01:37:13;01:37:16;"and kind of like one of those, like, I don't know,"
01:37:16;01:37:19;"it's like one of those kind of jackets that you might buy at a truck stop."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Like a windbreaker?"
01:37:21;01:37:22;"No, not a windbreaker."
01:37:22;01:37:27;"It's like plaid on the outside and then the inside is like white, fake shearling."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"Uh-huh."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"You know what I mean?"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"Yeah."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"Just like a real truck stop jacket."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"It's like huge."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"I mean, he looked great."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"How were those sweats?"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Were they like beat up, like gnarly gym sweats"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"or were they like new designer sweats?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"They weren't new designer sweats."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"They were somewhere in between."
01:37:42;01:37:45;"I'm not trying to give the impression that he was, like, dirty."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"It's like his clothes looked clean."
01:37:46;01:37:52;"It was just truly--and also just so incredibly comfortable, too."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"That's awesome."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"He was there with his lovely wife who was more dressed up."
01:37:56;01:38:00;"But just truly the only person at this, like, big Hollywood party"
01:38:00;01:38:05;"who was fully comfortable just kind of wearing whatever."
01:38:05;01:38:10;"And I got to say the only way I felt about it was just purely impressed."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Yeah."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Like, you could tell, like, you know when somebody's comfortable,"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"they make everybody else feel comfortable, too."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Yeah."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"That's awesome."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Yeah."
01:38:19;01:38:25;"So anybody who worried that Adam Sandler, with his incredible wealth and success,"
01:38:25;01:38:31;"maybe is now walking around in Givenchy or designer sweatpants--"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"I've worried about that."
01:38:33;01:38:39;"I can assure you that he's the same old lovable goofball,"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"not putting on airs whatsoever."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Let's get back to some Christmas music."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Absolutely."
01:38:44;01:38:47;"Here's Sharon Jones and the Dab Kings with ""Ain't No Chimneys in the Project."""
01:38:47;01:39:07;"[MUSIC - SHARON JONES, ""AIN'T NO CHIMNEYS IN THE PROJECT""]"
01:39:07;01:39:17;"(SINGING) When I was a child, I used to wonder how Santa put my toys under the tree."
01:39:17;01:39:26;"I said, Mama, can you tell me how this can be when there ain't no chimneys in the project?"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:39:28;01:39:31;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:39:31;01:39:35;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:39:35;01:39:44;"Mama sat me down and said, baby, Santa Claus does magic things."
01:39:44;01:39:49;"As soon as you're asleep, a chimney will appear."
01:39:49;01:39:53;"And in the morning, you will see all he brings."
01:39:53;01:39:58;"Don't you worry that there ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:40:00;01:40:03;"No, not in the project."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"No, no."
01:40:06;01:40:17;"[MUSIC - SHARON JONES, ""AIN'T NO CHIMNEYS IN THE PROJECT""]"
01:40:17;01:40:21;"Now I'm all grown and I see."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"Grown and I see."
01:40:22;01:40:27;"It wasn't Santa who got that magic done."
01:40:27;01:40:32;"Mama, now I know you are the one."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"There ain't no chimney."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"Ain't no chimney."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"No, no, no."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"In the project."
01:40:46;01:40:49;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:40:52;01:40:55;"In the project."
01:40:55;01:40:58;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Ain't no chimneys in the project."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"You're listening to Time Crisis Christmas Edition."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Jake and I are sitting."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"Sipping some eggnog."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"Sipping some eggnog."
01:41:07;01:41:10;"You know, this is a very casual show, obviously."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"This is a Christmas edition."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"So we're not going to do our typical top five."
01:41:14;01:41:18;"But we're just going to do a real casual listen through the top five most"
01:41:18;01:41:22;"downloaded Christmas songs of the digital era."
01:41:22;01:41:27;"It's time for the top five."
01:41:27;01:41:31;"So going back to, guess what year?"
01:41:31;01:41:35;"I think they started tracking it in 2013."
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Oh, really?"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"That recent?"
01:41:37;01:41:40;"Yeah, that's when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital downloads as well"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"as point of sale scans."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"So Nielsen was on the ball."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"I guess."
01:41:44;01:41:50;"So let's listen to the top five most downloaded Christmas songs."
01:41:50;01:41:57;"Number five is ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" by Brenda Lee."
01:41:57;01:42:03;"Sounds like it's from the '80s."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Oh, this song."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"I know this song."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Yeah."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"This is kind of a rinky-dink version, huh?"
01:42:09;01:42:12;"Brenda Lee, I thought, was sort of like a '60s country star."
01:42:12;01:42:16;"Yeah, so, you know, maybe 20 years later and you get some cash."
01:42:16;01:42:19;"Yeah, those drums are definitely '80s."
01:42:19;01:42:20;"I hate it."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"I mean, I love the song, but I hate that recording."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"Sorry, Brenda."
01:42:23;01:42:26;"I wonder why that version was so downloaded."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"I don't know."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"And not some classy, you know, '60s Phil Spector version."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"People just don't care."
01:42:32;01:42:36;"Coming in at number four is the Trans-Siberian Orchestra with ""Christmas Canon."""
01:42:36;01:42:38;"I've always been fascinated by Trans-Siberian Orchestra."
01:42:38;01:42:43;"It's some sort of, like, seasonal touring New Age epic."
01:42:43;01:42:44;"Yeah."
01:42:44;01:42:48;"They go around and play arenas."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"I hate this."
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Hold on."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Give it a chance."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Okay."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"Now do you like it?"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"I'm back in."
01:43:01;01:43:02;"Okay."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Oh, ""Christmas Canon."" It's ""Pachelbel's Canon."""
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Yeah."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"Okay."
01:43:23;01:43:28;"I don't associate ""Pachelbel's Canon"" as a Christmas song."
01:43:41;01:43:45;"Remember the graduation song by Vitamin C?"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Vaguely."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"I was thinking more Oasis."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Oh, right, right."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"This is one of the most famous chord progressions of all time."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Yeah, it's classic."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"Yeah, almost."
01:44:07;01:44:11;"It's a little bit of a different turnaround at the end."
01:44:11;01:44:17;"Yeah, people have said that the Vampire Weekend song ""Step"" is the same chord progression as ""Pachelbel's Canon,"""
01:44:17;01:44:18;"but it's not exactly."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"It's close."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"Try it."
01:44:24;01:44:27;"The glows of love, the wisdom teeth."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Oh, it's bad key for me."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Okay, you get the idea."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"""Christmas Canon"" by Trans-Siberian Orchestra."
01:44:45;01:44:49;"I think ""Pachelbel's Canon"" is just this classic, beautiful piece of music."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"So you can make it a little Christmassy, make it a little graduation-y if you want to."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"It's a very versatile chord progression."
01:44:55;01:44:59;"Sort of like your theory about Irish music being Christmassy."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Right, exactly."
01:45:00;01:45:05;"I think that's also just how we're conditioned with our Eurocentric Christmas attitude in this country."
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Right."
01:45:06;01:45:11;"I mean, one thing that's interesting to me is, you know where Christmas comes from?"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"The desert."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Right."
01:45:13;01:45:18;"I just want to point something out to everybody who's listening at home."
01:45:18;01:45:26;"In America, we have this kind of crazy notion that Christmas is about fir trees and winter."
01:45:26;01:45:40;"Have you ever heard of the--this is my kind of Andy Rooney moment--you hear the derisive way that people from the Northeast talk about Christmas in Arizona or Florida
or, you know, Southern California."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"It's something funny about it, right?"
01:45:42;01:45:45;"People have a good old laugh about Christmas in the desert."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Well, guess what?"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"It's just not Christmassy."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Yeah, it's not--oh, it's not Christmas."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"Oh, really?"
01:45:50;01:45:54;"It's so weird to be out in L.A. or Scottsdale for Christmas."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"What do you do?"
01:45:55;01:45:59;"Have a cactus tree for--a cactus Christmas tree?"
01:45:59;01:46:02;"Well, guess what, buddy?"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Christmas comes from the desert."
01:46:04;01:46:08;"Jesus was born in a town called Bethlehem."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Where's Bethlehem?"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Is Bethlehem in Germany?"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Is Bethlehem in the Black Forest?"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Nope."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Is it in the Midlands of England?"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"Is it in Northern New Hampshire?"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Definitely not."
01:46:21;01:46:30;"But look, whatever you want to say--look, it's not burning up over there in December, but it's definitely not--it's very rare to get snow in Bethlehem."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"It's not a white Christmas."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"It's not a white Christmas."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Not a white Christmas in Bethlehem."
01:46:35;01:46:44;"All right, so the number three most downloaded song of the digital era is Christmas Eve/Sarajevo, also by Trans-Siberian Orchestra."
01:46:44;01:46:48;"Let's see what this is all about."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Trans-Siberian Orchestra has a slight metal edge."
01:46:50;01:46:59;"Yeah."
01:46:59;01:47:05;"That's super Metallica, that chorus-y guitar tone."
01:47:05;01:47:18;"The more I try to walk away, the more I dub thee unforgiven."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"Oh!"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"This is dark."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"This sounds like the--"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"Number three!"
01:47:25;01:47:29;"Hey, Grandma, we're going to throw on some Christmas music."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"This is like WWE walk-on music."
01:47:32;01:47:39;"It's like The Undertaker is about to come out."
01:47:39;01:47:43;"Yeah, alone in your bedroom on Christmas."
01:47:43;01:47:51;"Oh, right, right, I have heard this, yeah."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"No, Grandma!"
01:47:54;01:48:01;"WWE Christmas Eve."
01:48:01;01:48:06;"Oh, that false harmonic on the guitar."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Oh, boy."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Yeah, that's super WWE."
01:48:09;01:48:10;"That is tasteless."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"He's picking up the Christmas tree!"
01:48:12;01:48:15;"Oh, I can't believe it!"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Oh, God."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"Whatever, it was kind of cool."
01:48:21;01:48:25;"The number two most downloaded Christmas song of the digital era"
01:48:25;01:48:29;"is a little bit lighter than Christmas Eve/Sarajevo."
01:48:29;01:48:31;"What's the Sarajevo reference?"
01:48:31;01:48:35;"Are they referencing, like, the war in the '90s?"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"Is this, like, the piece called that?"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"Oh, the original piece?"
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Yeah."
01:48:39;01:48:43;"[HUMMING]"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"I don't even know."
01:48:44;01:48:49;"The number two most downloaded song, a bit lighter,"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Chipmunks song,"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"""Christmas Don't Be Late."""
01:48:53;01:48:55;"I think this is their first song."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"The whole--"
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Is this from the '60s?"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"From the '60s."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"All right, Chipmunks, ready to sing your song?"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Yeah, let's sing it now."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"Okay, Simon."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Okay, Theodore."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Okay."
01:49:07;01:49:10;"Okay, Alvin."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Alvin."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"Alvin!"

01:49:44;01:49:47;"This is not the Chipmunks' first single."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"Their first number one hit was ""Witch Doctor,"""
01:49:50;01:49:52;"but this is actually from 1958."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"Oh, wow."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"And a little background--"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Multiple number one hits."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"I think you'll appreciate this."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"A little background on the Chipmunks,"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"a very California band."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"Obviously, those are the pitched-up voices of a grown man."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"I remember seeing this guy's name a lot as a kid"
01:50:07;01:50:11;"when I would watch the Chipmunks show on TV."
01:50:11;01:50:15;"So he had the stage name David Seville,"
01:50:15;01:50:18;"but his name was actually Rostam Bagdasarian."
01:50:18;01:50:21;"Not quite the same spelling as our friend Rostam"
01:50:21;01:50:25;"from ""Vampire Weekend,"" but--"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"with two O's."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"But he was born--"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"His last name is Bagdasarian."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"He was born in Fresno, California,"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"the youngest child of Dick in Virginia,"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"He enlisted in the United States Army"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"one month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,"
01:50:40;01:50:43;"and served until the end of World War II."

01:50:45;01:50:46;"Wow."
01:50:46;01:50:47;"--and kind of bouncing around in showbiz,"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"comes up with this good idea for a novelty record"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"to pitch these voices up."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"I mean, that's that real kind of like--"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"You know what?"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"The first thing I thought of was--"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"What was the movie about?"
01:51:00;01:51:01;"""The Master""?"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"""The Master."""
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Yeah, you know what I mean?"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Just like this whole generation of people"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"went and served in World War II,"
01:51:08;01:51:11;"come back to civilian life--"
01:51:11;01:51:12;"And are doing--"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Just do like the weirdest stuff."
01:51:14;01:51:18;"And just like-- and make their fortunes."
01:51:18;01:51:22;"Yeah, the most like frivolous, disposable entertainment."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"Wow."
01:51:23;01:51:27;"Anyway, shout out to Ross, Ross the Bagdasarian."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"What do you think the number one most downloaded"
01:51:29;01:51:32;"Christmas song of the digital era is?"
01:51:32;01:51:33;"John Lennon."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"What, ""Merry Christmas, War is Over""?"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Yeah."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"You're a dreamer, Jake."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"That's why we love having you on the show."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"You're really telling me that--"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"But I'm not the only one."
01:51:42;01:51:45;"[laughs]"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"""Merry Christmas, War is Over."""
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Yeah, that's my pick."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Yeah, you really think that's the number one--"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"You think that's what people want to hear?"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"They're with their families."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"They want to think about war being over."
01:51:56;01:51:58;"That's an uplifting message."
01:51:58;01:52:02;"Do you know how many people make their living off of war?"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"What about them?"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"Arms dealers, for instance."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Yeah, no, that's true."
01:52:06;01:52:09;"Jake, the lack of sympathy you have for the military"
01:52:09;01:52:14;"industrial complex is bizarre, to say the least."
01:52:14;01:52:18;"So anyway, no, it's not that hippie song about war being over."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"The number one most downloaded Christmas song"
