01:26;01:29;"were just talking about maybe doing the show in person sometime soon hopefully."
01:29;01:36;"That'd be interesting. I for one am sick of hanging out on the laptop. Yeah"
01:36;01:41;"definitely getting a little old. I know some people like it because they don't"
01:41;01:45;"have to drive or you know schlep around town but I was just saying I'm willing"
01:45;01:49;"to drive across town at rush hour to do the show in person. Yeah you used to have"
01:49;01:56;"it pretty harsh. I mean you know like a 45-minute drive to hang out with your"
01:56;02:04;"friends and tape a radio show every two weeks. I don't know if that's harsh. Yeah"
02:04;02:07;"I guess it depends who you are. I mean it's no surprise that well yeah I never"
02:07;02:11;"know what with you Jake what you're gonna find super harsh but it's it's one"
02:11;02:14;"of those things that like some people really f***ing hate and I do think it's a"
02:14;02:20;"little bit of like a mental exercise. That seems like some family feud sh*t. Top"
02:20;02:26;"five things that stress you out. It's gonna be like traffic, in-laws or some sh*t."
02:26;02:31;"Yeah family. Waiting in line for brunch. Let me see waiting in line for brunch."
02:31;02:36;"That stresses me out. Like you pull up to a restaurant you see that line and you're"
02:36;02:40;"just already like hell no. No way but then you're like meeting someone there"
02:40;02:45;"then it turns into a whole thing. Right. Yeah waiting more than like 15 minutes"
02:45;02:50;"for a restaurant it's like my true pet peeve. Stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic"
02:50;02:55;"in downtown LA trying to get over to Culver City to tape a show once every 14"
02:55;03:01;"days I can roll with that. If I did it every day it might get aggravating. Yeah"
03:01;03:05;"right if you got like the tough commute maybe that's why most people are like"
03:05;03:10;"super hate traffic is because it's like you know old-school day in day out"
03:10;03:16;"trying to get to your job not at your desk by 9 the boss is gonna give you"
03:16;03:22;"like some grief over sleep then you know some idiot cuts you off why are they"
03:22;03:27;"doing work right now yeah that's gonna piss people off but yeah I feel like"
03:27;03:30;"inherently traffic if you're kind of like alright this might take a while"
03:30;03:35;"it's almost like an aesthetic experience bumper-to-bumper Los Angeles traffic"
03:35;03:41;"getting cross town to do your internet radio show. Deeply aesthetic. Checking out"
03:41;03:48;"that bumper sticker scene. Yep just listening to local live radio about the"
03:48;03:53;"traffic. I mean that's some real sh*t especially growing up in New Jersey"
03:53;03:57;"going into the city which really wasn't very far although that's some of the"
03:57;04:03;"craziest traffic on earth is surrounding Manhattan and before phones before"
04:03;04:08;"there's any way to check and my dad was like you know doing serious commutes all"
04:08;04:14;"the time although he was often waking up you know super early with his job but I"
04:14;04:17;"have memories of kind of going into the city with him in the car and him like"
04:17;04:21;"listening to the AM radio and it was a bit of a thing like are you gonna take"
04:21;04:25;"the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland Tunnel I was just gonna say what was your"
04:25;04:30;"tunnel we lived kind of equidistant from both and if things are really crazy you"
04:30;04:33;"can take the George Washington Bridge but that would be a very extreme"
04:33;04:37;"situation or depend where you're going in Manhattan but it was the same like"
04:37;04:40;"you start driving you're like listening you're waiting for that like whatever"
04:40;04:44;"traffic on the 10s you know like hoping that you catch it those just be like"
04:44;04:48;"Holland Tunnel looking great and you just like that was the only way you"
04:48;04:53;"could do it you're putting on 770 a.m. or the one I always remember was 1010"
04:53;04:57;"winds I don't do you know that I don't sure 1010 winds was just like"
04:57;05:02;"traffic and weather on the 10s every 10 minutes or something and also 1010"
05:02;05:06;"winds was always like real stressful with that like kind of classic what is"
05:06;05:10;"it like a marimba going ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding actually Mac you pull that up"
05:10;05:15;"see if they got the 1010 winds yeah just music I don't know Matt pulls that up"
05:15;05:20;"you know I texted you guys and I was listening to the new Tim McGraw record"
05:20;05:26;"which is about LA in his title song LA there's the line I don't mind the"
05:26;05:32;"traffic on the 405 really oh yeah well in fact that's where I met a good"
05:32;05:36;"friend of mine all gridlock stopped and stuck there killing time long way from"
05:36;05:42;"home but that's alright he also can afford to see traffic through an"
05:42;05:47;"aesthetic lens because he's not in it regularly he's in traffic once every few"
05:47;05:52;"weeks he's not doing a regular commute like Joe six-pack and also he's in a"
05:52;05:57;"Ferrari this is 1010 wins the cross rocks is backed up all the way to Jerome"
05:57;06:01;"Avenue you can see the dramatic video at 1010 wins calm the station you know"
06:01;06:10;"people you trust John Montone 1010 wins I'm Bridget Quinn I'm 1010 wins you give"
06:10;06:16;"us 22 minutes we'll give you the world I mean why is the music so hardcore and"
06:16;06:22;"then that kind of like dark note comes in boom like all they're telling you is"
06:22;06:27;"how slammed the the Holland Tunnel is most of the time well it's funny we're"
06:27;06:32;"like touching back into that like drive time terrestrial radio aesthetic is a"
06:32;06:38;"few episodes ago as there was doing the rush Limbaugh style live read for the San"
06:38;06:44;"Diego area car dealership oh yeah when rush Limbaugh died I this was very TC I"
06:44;06:49;"thought when he died I found this or I saw it somewhere there was a link a clip"
06:49;06:55;"of him from 1974 when he was an FM radio DJ in Pittsburgh playing like rock hits"
06:55;07:00;"he went under the name Jeff Christie I think but anyway there was one clip of"
07:00;07:05;"him introducing the song garden party by Ricky Nelson which was a DC favorite"
07:05;07:10;"yep and he like sort of in a backhanded way was like this song by Ricky Nelson"
07:10;07:14;"who's sort of a hippie now oh yeah and it was like wow like it was just like a"
07:14;07:18;"little foreshadowing like where rush would go just kind of but he was just"
07:18;07:23;"doing he was doing that like rush voice but I just it was like so weird just to"
07:23;07:28;"like it was like the beginning like if someone made some like whack rush Limbaugh"
07:28;07:32;"biopic like that'd be like the like kind of the beginning of like private parts"
07:32;07:36;"style we're like he gets his first job in Pittsburgh and he's just like it's"
07:36;07:40;"all like the long hairs at the like rock station in Pittsburgh and then rush is"
07:40;07:44;"like sort of obscuring his reactionary views anyway I'm going down a rabbit"
07:44;07:50;"hole here but Adam McKay presents rush an eight-part limited series it opens"
07:50;07:55;"with that scene he's just like listening to the new Ricky Nelson it's hanging out"
07:55;08:02;"with Yoko I don't know about that I went to a garden party to reminisce with my"
08:02;08:12;"old friend chance to share old memories play our songs again when I got to the"
08:12;08:23;"garden party they all knew my name no one recognized me didn't look the same"
08:23;08:34;"but it all right now learn my lesson well see you can't please everyone so"
08:34;08:44;"you got to please yourself people came for miles around everyone was there"
08:44;08:55;"Yoko brought a walrus there was magic in the air over in the corner much to my"
08:55;09:06;"surprise mr. Hughes hidden Dylan shoes wearing his disguise but it all right"
09:06;09:16;"now learn my lesson well see you can't please everyone so you got to please"
09:16;09:21;"yourself yeah you know it's funny I watched the movie talk radio not that"
09:21;09:25;"long ago you guys ever see that Eric Boghossian from the 80s oh yeah years"
09:25;09:31;"ago Oliver Stone film it has these very long like kind of 40-minute scenes of"
09:31;09:35;"this dude doing his radio show hmm and he's just like going through the collars"
09:35;09:40;"and he's got these like crazy neo-nazi collars and people with him and it's"
09:40;09:45;"just like really tense day kind of based on on a real talk radio host who was"
09:45;09:51;"murdered in the 80s but anyway you could picture a two-hour film about Rush Limbaugh"
09:51;09:57;"in the early 70s in Pittsburgh and like somehow he's just like doing the show"
09:57;09:59;"and then he like throws on the Ricky Nelson he's having these like"
09:59;10:05;"conversations about like Watergate or some yeah it could be like a black box"
10:05;10:11;"theater play as well yeah almost like a play Jesse Plemons is Rush Limbaugh all"
10:11;10:16;"right Adam McKay presents Rush starring Jesse Plemons have you seen that that a"
10:16;10:19;"Robert Altman film where Philip Baker Hall plays Nixon"
10:19;10:24;"it's from 1984 he's the only one in the movie it's basically a filmed play and"
10:24;10:29;"he's just like Philip Baker Hall is just Nixon ranting in his office for two"
10:29;10:32;"hours well it's a tough watch but it's tight"
10:32;10:36;"highly recommend can't remember the name of the movie easy to find"
10:36;10:44;"interesting. Secret honor. Yep secret honor. Secret honor. Anyway recently Mick Jagger"
10:44;10:49;"released probably one of his best solo songs actually I'm really unfamiliar"
10:49;10:54;"with Mick Jagger solo work but he dropped a surprise song with Dave Grohl"
10:54;10:59;"honestly not bad it hit the DC thread of course apparently we're not gonna be"
10:59;11:02;"able to listen to the whole thing because it's only on YouTube is that"
11:02;11:05;"correct all right we might as well just let's just throw in the beginning just"
11:05;11:08;"to give everybody a taste"
11:12;11:17;"and this is Grohl on guitar and drums"
11:29;11:33;"so yeah we can't listen to the whole thing we gave everybody a taste Jake"
11:33;11:37;"what were your initial impressions well the song is called Easy Sleazy yeah not"
11:37;11:44;"totally sure why my initial impressions were that the song rules whoa it's strong"
11:44;11:51;"words Mick Jagger and Dave Grohl's best work in the 21st century I like it"
11:51;11:57;"better than like most Foo Fighters songs damn it's up there with like bottom and"
11:57;12:05;"Nirvana but I was like pleasantly surprised with the song I like to change"
12:05;12:10;"the chorus I mean it's kind of like a dumb kind of like vamping on a one chord"
12:10;12:14;"kind of verse and then like I like that change they go into it's a little"
12:14;12:18;"surprise I don't I don't love Grohl I mean I would have honestly I would have"
12:18;12:23;"loved to hear the song with Keith Richards playing guitar and Charlie"
12:23;12:27;"Watts on drums I think it would have been a six stone song and like they"
12:27;12:31;"would have like made it a little more tasteful and subtle and mellow I've"
12:31;12:36;"always thought Grohl was a little lacking in tone touch and lyricism"
12:36;12:41;"great drummer but the guitar play I just like but anyway point is I was feeling"
12:41;12:45;"it I mean he held it down and he helped him write the song he knows his classic"
12:45;12:49;"rock in and out I think they both did great job together on this tune but I"
12:49;12:54;"understand what you're coming from Jake it would be so interesting to be if we"
12:54;12:58;"could hear like you know the exile era lineup yeah I mean we could go back to"
12:58;13:02;"the Brian Jones era but I don't know if he would have that much to contribute"
13:02;13:06;"this feels like a 70s song so you know if we had the exile lineup there's like"
13:06;13:11;"well dude who played sax I mean it'd be sick yeah like that's a funny like weird"
13:11;13:17;"experiment if like the stones went back to some like weird basement and like set"
13:17;13:20;"up a tape machine and recorded like and they were just like committed to like"
13:20;13:24;"we're not doing we're not like loading our tapes onto like Pro Tools to edit"
13:24;13:29;"later well we're just like making a record on tape not with a high-profile"
13:29;13:34;"producer not like Rick Rubin just like we're making a record in 2021"
13:34;13:37;"Mick and Keith man and the boards it'd just be interesting and I don't think it"
13:37;13:41;"would be a success necessarily but yeah I wonder if Mick thought about hitting"
13:41;13:47;"Keith up for this they probably don't talk unless they got a tour to plan biz"
13:47;13:51;"do you think Keith Richards knows this song exists he's aware of it but has not"
13:51;13:55;"heard it yeah I mean he's definitely not like going deep on the internet I"
13:55;14:00;"wouldn't think although I could see him just like sitting at his mansion all the"
14:00;14:07;"jewelry bandanas and just like with an iPad scrolling Apple News and I could"
14:07;14:13;"see him see the headline just like Dave growl yeah I can actually see him"
14:13;14:16;"hearing it checking it out the interesting thing about it is like it's"
14:16;14:21;"definitely not a bad song and shout out to Dave growl for like doing like a"
14:21;14:27;"appropriately Keith classic type chord voicings yeah the strangest thing about"
14:27;14:31;"this song or maybe the coolest thing however you want to look at it are the"
14:31;14:36;"lyrics oh yeah especially the later verses it's a very unusual feeling"
14:36;14:42;"hearing Mick get into this zone maybe there's some like deep stone stuff I"
14:42;14:46;"don't know but he's just like he and Keith are such great lyricists and their"
14:46;14:52;"vibes it's always like you know using classic American metaphors to like tell"
14:52;14:57;"a story it's almost like he's uh it's not quite weird out but he's getting"
14:57;15:02;"into this like just funny topical zone that's like just very on not"
15:02;15:05;"particularly stones he said let's look at the lyrics for a second we took it on"
15:05;15:10;"the chin the numbers were so grim bossed around by pricks stiff and other upper"
15:10;15:17;"lips pacing in the yard you're trying to take the Mick okay that's funny this is"
15:17;15:20;"the first time Mick Jagger has ever said use the phrase take the Mick in a song"
15:20;15:25;"wait what does take the Mick mean it's like some English it looks like they've"
15:25;15:29;"never referenced it in the lyrics so this is the first instance of that"
15:29;15:34;"expression to tease or to kid okay so you're trying to take the Mick yeah like"
15:34;15:38;"so this is like it's like a double entendre like you're trying to like take"
15:38;15:43;"on it's like are you kidding me are you kidding me with Mick yeah don't"
15:43;15:47;"with Mick yeah you're trying to take the Mick I think people say that a lot in"
15:47;15:50;"England so that's pretty deep that Mick Jagger's only singing now you're trying"
15:50;15:55;"to take the Mick you must think I'm really thick that just means dumb right"
15:55;15:59;"well people say that in America that's only an English thing right to be thick"
15:59;16:04;"no people say that here so he's kind of I mean people our age don't say it but"
16:04;16:08;"like really old people it has a like a different connotation I think when"
16:08;16:12;"people talk about being thick when they spell it THICC does that mean you're"
16:12;16:19;"dumb yeah looking at the graphs with the magnifying glass cancel all the tours"
16:19;16:24;"footballs fake applause no more travel brochures virtual premieres I've got"
16:24;16:28;"nothing left to wear looking out from these prison walls you got to rob Peter"
16:28;16:33;"if you're paying Paul but it's easy easy everything's gonna get really freaky"
16:33;16:37;"all right on the night soon it'll be a memory you're trying to remember to"
16:37;16:42;"forget the verses have that kind of like I don't know like office Christmas"
16:42;16:47;"party song vibe you know just like being topical just like yeah everyone in"
16:47;16:51;"accounting got together to write a song and they referenced all the things that"
16:51;16:55;"happened at the office that year it's got that vibe but he and Dave Grohl or"
16:55;16:59;"whoever wrote the lyrics was too talented because actually the chorus is"
16:59;17:04;"like very talented what yeah no the chorus is strong the chorus is like a"
17:04;17:08;"real could easily be a late Rolling Stones song looking at all your prison"
17:08;17:12;"walls you got to rob Peter if you're paying Paul that's strong but it's it's"
17:12;17:15;"easy easy everything's gonna get really freaky all right on the night soon will"
17:15;17:19;"be a memory you're trying to remember to forget that's like some classic like Mick"
17:19;17:25;"like fun with words I love that last line it's like it he's like things are"
17:25;17:30;"about like everyone's getting vaccinated soon Kovac is gonna be in the rearview"
17:30;17:35;"mirror mm-hmm it's gonna get crazy it's gonna get easy and sleazy people are"
17:35;17:39;"gonna party oh is that what the easy sleazy refers to that's how I interpret"
17:39;17:43;"it oh yeah everyone's really free just like things like like by mid late summer"
17:43;17:48;"things are just gonna be like ripping mix been dying to party how old hell"
17:48;17:54;"yeah right now 78 that's my guess I don't know that's a good guess you know"
17:54;17:58;"what's funny I feel like all of the like big baby boomer rock stars maybe we've"
17:58;18:01;"talked about this we're actually born before the baby boom which starts in"
18:01;18:08;"1945 mmm all the big baby boomers were born like basically during the war 77"
18:08;18:14;"seven well year was he born 43 exactly he's bored born during World War two not"
18:14;18:18;"a baby boomer right it's not a baby boom if the war is still raging all of those"
18:18;18:22;"60s rock stars guys were born before that that's a great like all of their"
18:22;18:26;"all of their fans were like five years younger than them and were born in like"
18:26;18:31;"the late 40s or early 50s yeah but they were all like a little bit older you"
18:31;18:36;"know how we talked about what was it Donald Trump Bill Clinton George W Bush"
18:36;18:40;"were all born within like three months of each other right that was some real"
18:40;18:46;"freaky Illuminati type stuff they were all born 1943 no they're born later I"
18:46;18:51;"think I think they're born in like 46 or 7 I think they're baby boomers 46 oh"
18:51;18:56;"they're born 46 okay so the president's are all baby boomers the rock stars are"
18:56;19:02;"all like weird war babies war babies yeah Jerry Neil young Jerry Garcia Jerry's"
19:02;19:08;"42 I think the stones like they're all born in the early 40s it's real weird I"
19:08;19:12;"bet you could probably chart that somehow like sometimes with cultural"
19:12;19:18;"movements it's better to be born on either side of it or something mm-hmm"
19:18;19:23;"yeah Bob Dylan I'm guessing also early 40s what were you with Bob Dylan born"
19:23;19:31;"I'm gonna guess 43 or something 41 whoa it's such a cluster yeah no that's what's"
19:31;19:34;"like you have a captive audience of kids that are like five or six years younger"
19:34;19:40;"than you mm-hmm so you're like 22 and like you're back then you were you're"
19:40;19:46;"20 2021 putting out your record and all the kids are like 14 15 I think that"
19:46;19:51;"that's pretty standard pop culture stuff like actors it's sort of aspirational"
19:51;19:56;"you know like watching saved by the bell or something usually it's like four or"
19:56;20:02;"five you know years younger those kids watching that it's like it's a right or"
20:02;20:07;"more you know I'm just thinking of like something I would you know it's like you"
20:07;20:10;"start thinking of like who are the people watching like shows or listening"
20:10;20:14;"to music and yeah like putting pictures of them in your locker or whatever you"
20:14;20:18;"do it's gonna be just like three four years younger yeah yeah it makes sense"
20:18;20:25;"that whatever the people born between 40 and 45 are the type of people is in"
20:25;20:30;"terms of what really like coalesced in terms of like 60s counterculture kind of"
20:30;20:35;"came of age in the 50s probably found it pretty stiff they all like read on the"
20:35;20:41;"road blew their mind we're into the folk revival then they're into the Beatles it"
20:41;20:45;"really is like all the so many of these people a lot of them reference like some"
20:45;20:49;"of like the same stuff there's wasn't that much stuff so there was like 50s"
20:49;20:53;"beatnik stuff was kind of known as like the more extreme counterculture or like"
20:53;21:00;"jazz based counterculture stuff and then you get early rock and roll the blues"
21:00;21:06;"throw that together a little bit of country and Western folk revival it all"
21:06;21:13;"comes together no wonder these people kind of like connected I'm a 20 21 yep"
21:13;21:18;"and make it's written easy-sleazy now mix written easy-sleazy did you notice"
21:18;21:22;"he had a very pronounced English accent in this one yeah is he like doing like a"
21:22;21:26;"punk thing yeah like almost like a Johnny Rotten yeah he's getting back to"
21:26;21:31;"some stupid tickle dance oh yeah we didn't listen to it but the second verse"
21:31;21:37;"we got to go through that's a pretty mask but never take a chance tick-tock"
21:37;21:42;"stupid dance took a samba class yeah I landed on my ass trying to write a tune"
21:42;21:46;"you better hook me up to zoom see my poncy books teach myself to cook"
21:46;21:51;"actually we need another English number crunch is a ponce like a pretentious"
21:51;21:57;"person Mick is reading Proust and James Joyce you know are you just sees the man"
21:57;22:02;"shelf living what it's a man living off another's earnings especially a woman's"
22:02;22:10;"synonym of pimp well especially one hired as a bodyguard or trip I guess a"
22:10;22:15;"different maybe look up poncy cuz kept man I think that's okay Mary but you"
22:15;22:19;"know when I just looked at poncy one definition was pretentious or affected"
22:19;22:24;"so it's probably somehow interrelated Mick driving the tick-tock references"
22:24;22:27;"pretty wild"
22:27;22:29;"Oh"
23:02;23:10;"it's a strange piece of art but it's fun and it's very Mick it's very on-brand"
23:10;23:15;"that he's like he's been chomping at the bit very social guy a lot of the other"
23:15;23:19;"kind of boomer rock stars they got in the mix a little earlier I don't think"
23:19;23:23;"we ever listened to it but we talked about Van Morrison wrote a series of"
23:23;23:29;"anti lockdown songs well I want to get into that next yes please let's just"
23:29;23:33;"spend the whole episode listening to boomer kovat songs we could actually"
23:33;23:37;"that's just the best one you've heard I have actually heard the Van Morrison"
23:37;23:40;"song yeah I'm dying to hear it okay maybe now's the time wait sorry but hold"
23:40;23:46;"on yeah can we just move forward to the last verse okay verse 3 shooting the"
23:46;23:51;"vaccine Bill Gates in my bloodstream it's mind control the earth is flat and"
23:51;23:57;"cold it's never warming up the Arctic's turned to slush the seconds coming late"
23:57;24:03;"there's aliens in the deep state I love it he went there he went full Joe Rogan"
24:03;24:11;"or you know even beyond I mean I think it's a parody of that I'm assuming"
24:11;24:15;"because like Mick is too self-aware and savvy to like put himself out on some"
24:15;24:20;"like whack political stance that's gonna alienate people much like Van Morrison"
24:20;24:24;"did Van Morrison's sort of like and Eric Clapton are like I don't care about my"
24:24;24:29;"reputation I'm an old cranky guy F you but Mick is still like I'm in the mix"
24:29;24:34;"I'm hip I want to be liked it's not impossible to imagine Mick like you know"
24:34;24:37;"to his credit it's what you want from Mick but kind of almost being like maybe"
24:37;24:43;"this song could be a hit maybe it goes viral on tick-tock although he was a hit"
24:43;24:50;"was it a hit I mean you're talking about it I mean it's an NFT"
24:50;24:55;"block it we got a research that's another element that the song is an NFT"
24:55;25:01;"it's so weak how much of the NFT version of it go to for how much we find out I"
25:01;25:05;"bought a charity it is a charity oh I don't know if it's if the auction is"
25:05;25:11;"good so I went on sale last Thursday all proceeds from the NFT sale will be"
25:11;25:16;"divvied up between music venue trust a UK based charity nice for music venues"
25:16;25:20;"and National Independent Venue Association oh that's great"
25:20;25:25;"tight very cool gentlemen but also very curious how much that NFT is going for I"
25:25;25:31;"just feel like the NFT crowd and the easy sleazy crowd it's not the most"
25:31;25:37;"obvious intersection yeah I'm just picturing like the 22 year old crypto"
25:37;25:41;"billionaire you know this comes across their desk and they're just like what"
25:41;25:47;"who I don't think there's any public information right now about what it sold"
25:47;25:51;"for sold for 60 bucks"
25:51;26:04;"Nick was very disappointed it underperformed at auction no money went"
26:04;26:10;"to the charities make is like well mate it cost us at least two grand to make"
26:10;26:15;"the song man you know between a zoom or my premium zoom subscription you know"
26:15;26:22;"electricity mate it's wait I think I think I got it okay the auction the so"
26:22;26:27;"on a site called nifty gateway which I guess is Mick Jagger's profile for the"
26:27;26:34;"sale that's an NFT platform oh got it okay great okay so this is where you're"
26:34;26:40;"selling it $50,000 was the highest bid okay to an anonymous bidder"
26:40;26:42;"correct okay that was probably Mick Jagger"
26:42;26:47;"yes one question I have is when you hear about these big NFT auctions still know"
26:47;26:51;"very little about it like when you heard about the really expensive people one"
26:51;26:55;"they always reference that it's a crypto billionaire who bought it I wonder if"
26:55;27:02;"there's just like any super rich person who heard about NFTs and was like well I"
27:02;27:07;"don't have any crypto but I would love to have that new whatever like Taco Bell"
27:07;27:13;"one and they or if anybody actually just converted like USD into crypto just to"
27:13;27:16;"like get out of the market right like it's one thing if you have more more"
27:16;27:19;"cryptocurrency than you know what to do it it's another thing just to be like"
27:19;27:24;"just call your account and just like I'm gonna need you to buy me a three million"
27:24;27:29;"dollars of aetherium right now because I got are you sure cuz the markets real"
27:29;27:34;"hot it might cool off at any second we'll see"
27:34;27:39;"shout out to Mick Jagger solid song okay so classic Mick he's more he's excited to"
27:39;27:45;"party lockdown has probably been very boring for him but he's not getting in"
27:45;27:49;"the mix too early although this would have been a tight song to drop just like"
27:49;27:53;"in the middle of lockdown maybe he didn't quite have enough material that"
27:53;27:57;"would have been fun like well I think pre vaccine rollout it would have been"
27:57;28:01;"weird to drop this because you know like last summer like it was unclear what the"
28:01;28:05;"vaccine timeline was it would have been like someday we'll get out of this and"
28:05;28:11;"part right might have gotten some heat so yeah maybe we finally need to dive in"
28:11;28:15;"I can't even imagine what this sounds like dive into the Van Morrison oh yeah"
28:15;28:21;"before we do yeah Ezra if Mick gives you a call or his people reach out yeah to"
28:21;28:27;"your people and they want you on easy sleazy yeah how do you respond I would"
28:27;28:30;"just say you got the wrong guy I just don't think I'm bringing anything to the"
28:30;28:33;"project I'm not even like being trying to get out of it like Mick you're an"
28:33;28:40;"absolute legend I worship you huge fan of everything you do but I just kind of"
28:40;28:44;"be like you know what I would probably take the easy way out and say just like"
28:44;28:48;"maybe I could contribute some lyrics again Dave Grohl he like he can play"
28:48;28:51;"everything he's the classic rock dude he probably had a blast like putting the"
28:51;28:56;"music together that wouldn't be me you talking about a remix are you talking"
28:56;29:00;"about like hypothetically the original I like I was I was thinking original I"
29:00;29:05;"like the idea of he approaches Ezra for the remix slightly longer multiple guest"
29:05;29:13;"verses different be Danny Brown Danny so we got a lot of material to get through"
29:13;29:20;"folks Van Morrison released a three-song EP about the lockdown and then later"
29:20;29:32;"Eric Clapton the concept of a Van Morrison EP and then after the EP Eric"
29:32;29:36;"Clapton was releasing a song called stand and deliver and he asked Van"
29:36;29:40;"Morrison to jump on it with him probably because he knew they were like-minded"
29:40;29:44;"what's the first song on the Van Morrison EP stand and deliver is that it"
29:44;29:48;"well no that's the Eric Clapton one let's see the hear the song that kicked"
29:48;29:53;"it off let's go to the Van Morrison yeah the EP listen to it oh well there's a"
29:53;29:59;"song called no more lockdown pretty straightforward direct"
29:59;30:07;"no more lockdown no more government overreach"
30:07;30:15;"no more fascist police disturbing our peace"
30:15;30:26;"no more taking up our freedom and our God-given rights pretending it's for our"
30:26;30:33;"safety when it's really to enslave"
30:33;30:41;"who's running our country who's running our world. His voice sounds pretty good."
30:41;30:52;"examine it closely and watch it unfurl. So it's very conspiratorial. No more lockdown"
30:52;30:57;"no more threats"
30:57;31:05;"no more Imperial College scientists making up crooked facts. So he just"
31:05;31:10;"doesn't even believe in it he's full on the train of like this is like a global"
31:10;31:14;"world order that wants to control people"
31:14;31:18;"no more celebrities telling us"
31:18;31:22;"telling us what we're supposed to feel"
31:22;31:27;"no more status quo. Is that much of a reach for Van? I mean he was always sort of like a new agey"
31:27;31:32;"like just connect with your inner life and like it's not a far leap from like"
31:32;31:38;"60s spiritual guy like Astro Weeks to like distrusting major institutions and"
31:38;31:43;"like being paranoid 50 years. It's not that much of a leap. Well he says the"
31:43;31:46;"Imperial College scientists are making up crooked facts. He's just asking"
31:46;31:53;"questions. Play Born to be Free. I want to get a little more understanding of his"
31:53;31:56;"point of view."
31:56;32:09;"This sounds good. Built 60s throwback."
32:09;32:18;"Well will the birds in the trees know something we can't see?"
32:18;32:27;"Does he know we were born to be free? Pretty normal so far. Don't need the"
32:27;32:37;"government cramping my style. Give them a lynch they take a mile. Take you in with a"
32:37;32:44;"phony smile. Wouldn't you agree? I mean yeah this could have been from the 60s."
32:44;32:51;"Pretty normal. It's not normal. It's no kind of normal at all."
32:51;33:00;"Everyone seems to have amnesia. Just trying to remember the Berlin Wall."
33:00;33:09;"Some kind of new old ideology. A weird new psychology."
33:09;33:16;"But it's not for the benefit of you and me. No no no."
33:16;33:24;"Pretty classic vibes. Aren't you just waiting for the other shoe to drop like"
33:24;33:29;"the SNL sketch when then he just starts talking about the government and the alien flying."
33:29;33:32;"It just gets crazier and crazier."
33:32;33:36;"New normal is not normal. The new normal is not normal. It's no kind of normal at all."
33:36;33:41;"We all agree with that Van. It sucks. COVID sucked. Lockdown sucked."
33:41;33:47;"He's coming at it from a very paranoid worldview. Yes."
33:47;33:53;"I'm not trying to scam anyone here man. There's a bad pandemic. We gotta lock down for a while dude."
33:53;33:57;"These songs are pretty vague actually. They're not as specific as say Easy Sleazy."
33:57;34:04;"I wonder if... You make a good point Jake. Like he's a 60s kind of searcher dude."
34:04;34:09;"It's understandable that he might question authority and not like certain elements of..."
34:09;34:13;"I think you need to listen to the next one. Okay maybe this is the one that's gonna put it all together."
34:13;34:16;"Let's go to the next one. To really get the context. Yeah. Okay let's go there."
34:16;34:21;"What's this one called? As I Walked Out."
34:21;34:24;"Sounds great."
34:24;34:32;"As I walked out, all the streets were empty."
34:32;34:36;"The government said everyone should stay home."
34:36;34:41;"Then they spread fear and loathing and no hope for the future."
34:41;34:46;"This is like based on... This is like Streets of Laredo."
34:46;34:54;"Well on the government website... Streets of Laredo."
34:54;35:00;"That's cool. He's taking an old melody."
35:00;35:13;"I like him citing the website."
35:13;35:16;"Why all the media outlets and the government lackeys."
35:16;35:21;"Why is this not big news? Why is it being ignored?"
35:21;35:26;"Why no checks and balances? Why no second opinions?"
35:26;35:31;"Why are they working and why are we not?"
35:31;35:35;"Why are they working and why are we not?"
35:35;35:45;"Maybe Van Morrison was really feeling for his organ player."
35:45;35:49;"That dude was just like, ""Van, lockdown's killing me, man."""
35:49;35:52;"""You got any work for me?"""
35:52;35:56;"He's like, ""Alright, I'll write some songs."""
35:56;36:02;"As I walked out, the streets were all empty."
36:02;36:04;"His voice sounds great, I gotta say."
36:04;36:07;"I wasn't under the mistaken impression that his voice had gotten really weird as he got older."
36:07;36:10;"He sounds excellent."
36:10;36:13;"No hope for the future."
36:13;36:16;"Not many did question this very strange move."
36:16;36:19;"I wonder if this is just one take."
36:19;36:21;"Probably."
36:21;36:33;"This is real street busker vibes."
36:33;36:35;"Oh yeah."
36:35;36:45;"I guess I would ask him, ""Dude, you seem to be insinuating this is some crazy huge conspiracy."""
36:45;36:53;"""These people that are running the government didn't benefit from everyone staying at home and the economy eating s***."""
36:53;36:56;"""Who's benefiting here?"""
36:56;36:58;"I guess that's what I would ask him."
36:58;37:02;"I'm sure somebody could make a good case for who's benefiting."
37:02;37:05;"It doesn't mean, obviously, it's a big question if it's a conspiracy."
37:05;37:08;"You've probably seen somewhere people have these charts where they're just like,"
37:08;37:14;"""The 1% added this many trillion dollars to their wealth and the bottom 50 lost this much."""
37:14;37:17;"That would have happened regardless."
37:17;37:20;"It might not have been quite as fast without COVID."
37:20;37:23;"But it seems like the more sophisticated take is like,"
37:23;37:28;"""Okay, so then were there certain measures in place that allowed that to happen?"""
37:28;37:33;"""Were there certain things the government could have done that could have stopped this huge transfer of wealth?"""
37:33;37:36;"Maybe there are reasonable questions to ask."
37:36;37:39;"But he's not really getting into the weeds on it."
37:39;37:46;"Because it's very hard to make the case that the government should not have done anything."
37:46;37:49;"Right. I mean, it was a novel virus."
37:49;37:52;"No one knew anything at that point, basically."
37:52;37:55;"""But on the government website from the 21st of March..."""
37:55;37:58;"That's the best part of any of these songs is the government website."
37:58;38:02;"Also, he could have had a more interesting artistic way in."
38:02;38:07;"I will say that I like that he's getting into some classic old school 60s van."
38:07;38:08;"Pretty tasteful."
38:08;38:11;"I mean, they're more tasteful than ""Easy Sleazy."""
38:11;38:14;"I mean, I like ""Easy Sleazy,"" don't get me wrong."
38:14;38:17;"I mean, this could have been an outtake on ""Moon Dance."""
38:17;38:23;"""But on the government website..."""
38:23;38:25;"They released the ""Moon Dance"" outtakes."
38:25;38:29;"There's a song called ""Government Website."" It's very mysterious."
38:29;38:33;"You didn't have a lot of people talking about websites in 1969."
38:33;38:37;"Yeah, he had it originally in the track listing right after ""Into the Mystic."""
38:37;38:41;"And it just wasn't working, so he cut it."
38:41;38:43;"""Government Website"" is kind of GBV, too."
38:43;38:45;"""Government Website!"""
38:45;38:48;"I know there's a GBV record coming out called ""Before Computers,"""
38:48;38:51;"which I have to say is a compelling title."
38:51;38:55;"Very compelling. That seems worth checking out."
38:55;38:56;"All right, we made it this far."
38:56;39:01;"I guess we got to check out one last song, the Eric Clapton one featuring Van."
39:01;39:02;"What's that called?"
39:02;39:04;"""Stand and Deliver."""
39:04;39:08;"So that means Eric Clapton was just hearing these and being like, ""Hell yeah, Van."""
39:31;39:34;"Is this Eric or Van singing?"
39:34;39:36;"I guess Eric?"
39:36;39:43;"""Not a word you heard was true."" Okay, that's pretty extreme."
39:43;39:47;"This song is performed by Eric Clapton and written by Van Morrison."
39:47;39:49;"Okay, interesting."
39:49;39:52;"It's the easy sleazy."
39:52;39:59;"Van was just like, ""Eric, I got one extra song. It didn't make the EP, but I could really hear you on it."""
39:59;40:05;"""Do you wanna be a free man? Or do you wanna be a slave?"""
40:05;40:14;"""Do you wanna wear these chains until you're lying in the grave?"""
40:14;40:21;"Why are the artists doing all the COVID songs from the UK?"
40:21;40:24;"That's a good question. I mean, did they have more hardcore lockdowns?"
40:24;40:26;"Yeah, I guess."
40:26;40:28;"I don't think so."
40:28;40:33;"I think it's ordinary old millionaire pre-Boomer rock stars."
40:33;40:36;"What year was Clapton born?"
40:36;40:38;"I'm gonna guess '43."
40:38;40:44;"""I just wanna do my job playing the blues for my friends."""
40:44;40:46;"'45."
40:46;40:48;"He's '76."
40:48;40:50;"Wait, but what month?"
40:50;40:52;"March."
40:52;40:54;"Okay, he's not a Boomer."
40:54;40:59;"Boomer might have started in '46, because the war ended in August of '45."
40:59;41:07;"So it would have been like, everyone got pregnant in September or October of '45, and then everyone was born in '46."
41:07;41:10;"Okay, but that was the whole war. What day was V-Day?"
41:10;41:12;"That was like June of '45."
41:12;41:16;"Wait, like when they raided the beaches of Normandy?"
41:16;41:19;"This is the worst of the songs."
41:19;41:21;"Oh, D-Day."
41:21;41:22;"This is the worst."
41:22;41:24;"I think it ended in August of '45."
41:24;41:29;"No, V-Day is when the Nazis collapsed, and V-J-Day is when Japan surrendered."
41:29;41:33;"Okay, yeah, maybe Japan was August. Maybe Nazis were a little bit before that."
41:33;41:36;"Either way, Clapton is not a Boomer. He was born in March."
41:36;41:39;"June 6, 1944 was D-Day."
41:39;41:40;"That was D-Day."
41:40;41:43;"All right, what's the next question? Did his father serve?"
41:47;41:53;"I'm listening to some tasty Clapton Blues riffs, looking up on Wikipedia, ""Did his father serve?"""
41:53;41:59;"This is so good for this conversation, but this is literally my least favorite kind of music."
41:59;42:01;"Right? I mean..."
42:01;42:02;"Oh, it's terrible."
42:02;42:03;"Boomer Blues?"
42:03;42:06;"It's the worst. Boomer Blues."
42:06;42:12;"I mean, this is like, you're at the hotel bar, and there's guys playing blues."
42:12;42:15;"Seinfeld, ""Did Clapton's father serve?"""
42:15;42:21;"Yeah, so his father did serve, and so did his stepfather."
42:21;42:24;"He had two father figures who served."
42:24;42:30;"Thank you for your service, Mr. Clapton and Mr. Stepfather."
42:30;42:33;"Okay, enough of this."
42:33;42:35;"That's rough music."
42:35;42:41;"The song ends with Clapton singing Dick Turpin for a mask, too."
42:41;42:43;"Who the hell is Dick Turpin?"
42:43;42:49;"He's an 18th century highwayman who wore a mask to conceal his identity while committing crimes."
42:49;42:51;"Oh, that's kind of a good lyric."
42:51;42:53;"Oh, you think it's cool to wear a mask?"
42:53;42:54;"Shout out to Van Morrison."
42:54;42:56;"Dick Turpin wore a mask, too."
42:56;42:58;"I hate to criticize a legend."
42:58;42:59;"I know you hate to."
42:59;43:03;"But Van, all four songs are so similar."
43:03;43:07;"They're basically all saying, ""You can't trust the government. What's up with this lockdown?"""
43:07;43:12;"Van Morrison is a very talented songwriter."
43:12;43:22;"Think to some of those beautiful, long songs on Astral Weeks, or even before that, the kind of long, blues, epic TB Sheets."
43:22;43:25;"That's like a 10-minute song."
43:25;43:28;"I love late '60s, early '70s Van."
43:28;43:30;"St. Dominic's preview record, ""Two Below Honey."""
43:30;43:32;"There's really nothing like it."
43:32;43:34;"Beautiful albums."
43:34;43:39;"I'm willing to believe he knows a lot more about COVID than just that you can't trust the government."
43:39;43:46;"So, I would have loved to hear his, like, you know, 20-minute murder most foul about COVID."
43:46;43:47;"That would have made such a big impact."
43:47;43:54;"Rather than four songs spread out between two artists, Van just came in and was like, ""Boom. Here's everything I gotta say."""
43:54;44:01;"And he got into his poetic sh-t, like, you know, picture like the, ""do-do-do-do,"" like, kind of sweet thing vibe, Astral Weeks."
44:01;44:11;"And just like, ""You know, on the government website, on the government website, the government,"" you know, like, he could just really, like, let it cook."
44:11;44:14;"That would have been cool."
44:14;44:17;"I wonder what Bob Dylan thought of this stuff."
44:17;44:19;"You know he checked it out."
44:19;44:22;"Well, you know, we could think again about murder most foul."
44:22;44:24;"'Cause, wait, did murder most foul come out during COVID?"
44:24;44:25;"I think it did."
44:25;44:26;"Yeah, it was like a year ago, man."
44:26;44:27;"It was like early COVID."
44:27;44:28;"Right."
44:28;44:29;"March 27th."
44:29;44:34;"It's very possible that he, well, he'd, apparently he'd recorded that song a long time ago, but the timing was interesting."
44:34;44:35;"Yeah."
44:35;44:43;"So, I mean, you could say a lot of people believe this. Bob Dylan was like, kind of the craftiest and wiliest of them all."
44:43;44:52;"Maybe Bob Dylan saw the lockdown happening and he shared that same kind of conspiratorial boomer sentiment as his friends and colleagues."
44:52;44:55;"But rather than just say you can't trust the government,"
44:55;44:59;"Bob Dylan made an oblique commentary by talking about the JFK conspiracy."
44:59;45:01;"Oh, wow."
45:01;45:02;"That's a great read, dude."
45:02;45:06;"Bob just, like, hits up, like, he's like, ""Hey, Tony, remember that JFK song I did?"""
45:06;45:07;"He's like, ""Yeah."""
45:07;45:09;"He's like, ""You got that on the hard drive?"""
45:09;45:10;"And he's like, ""Yeah."""
45:10;45:12;"He's like, ""All right. I think this would be a good week to drop it."""
45:12;45:14;"You got that on that Dropbox file?"
45:14;45:17;"The link expired. Can I listen to that again?"
45:17;45:21;"Government website sounds more Dylan than Van Morrison."
45:21;45:24;"Well, Dylan definitely would have done the 17th."
45:24;45:26;"He definitely would have done the 17-minute government website."
45:26;45:28;"The government website!"
45:28;45:33;"But remember, we went deep on Murder Most Foul."
45:33;45:35;"Man, I'd love to listen to Murder Most Foul again."
45:35;45:38;"Really fascinating song."
45:38;45:41;"But, you know, what did he say? Some sh*t in it that's kind of like,"
45:41;45:46;"it was like the greatest trick the world had ever seen or something like that."
45:46;45:51;"Something to the effect of, like, this was pulled off in broad daylight, but no one saw a thing."
45:51;45:52;"Yeah."
45:52;45:55;"Like, yeah, the greatest trick, magic trick anyone's ever seen."
45:55;46:01;"I still think about that idea that Bob Dylan, and again, maybe we're giving him too much credit,"
46:01;46:03;"but it's still an interesting way to think."
46:03;46:09;"The idea that people pick these huge defining events as something that shifted culture."
46:09;46:18;"COVID is a slow, painful one, compared to an immediate assassination or an act of terrorism like 9/11."
46:18;46:25;"But it will go down in history as one of those major turning point ones that changed everything."
46:25;46:30;"Changed culture, changed technology, sped up inequality, whatever."
46:30;46:35;"And it is interesting to think that for Bob Dylan and his generation,"
46:35;46:40;"it all kind of started with, on some Adam Curtis sh*t, it all started with the JFK assassination."
46:40;46:42;"It was like, whoa."
46:42;46:45;"And again, this depends on what you believe."
46:45;46:52;"If you believe he was just killed by one person, and Jake has actually done original research at Dealey Plaza in Dallas,"
46:52;46:54;"so I trust you, Jake."
46:54;46:58;"Well, I don't know. I'm very agnostic on the JFK assassination."
46:58;47:06;"But all I'll say is when I was in the window looking down onto the spot where Kennedy was shot,"
47:06;47:08;"it did seem remarkably close."
47:08;47:10;"Right. You don't have to be a sharp shooter."
47:10;47:15;"All of the stuff with the three shots within a certain amount of time, I'm very agnostic."
47:15;47:17;"I'm open to all."
47:17;47:21;"Whether you believe it was a conspiracy or even just an emotional moment."
47:21;47:23;"It was a turkey shoot!"
47:23;47:28;"Even just an emotional moment where people felt like, wow, you can't trust anything."
47:28;47:30;"Things can change."
47:30;47:37;"The idea that, again, Bob Dylan, in the time of COVID, decided to go back 60 years-ish to that event,"
47:37;47:40;"and felt like this is the moment for me to talk about that,"
47:40;47:45;"as if that was a turning point moment that we're still in,"
47:45;47:50;"again, so much more interesting than just saying you can't trust the government."
47:50;47:51;"And that's why Bob Dylan--"
47:51;47:52;"There's an article--"
47:52;47:54;"You're our Boomer of the Week."
47:54;47:57;"Or no, you're a pre-boomer of the week."
47:57;48:01;"There's an article on the HuffPo, or the Huffington Post,"
48:01;48:06;"that says Bob Dylan responds to coronavirus with a song about the JFK assassination."
48:06;48:10;"So, I do feel there's other people on your wavelength."
48:10;48:13;"And it was so early and during COVID that it was like--"
48:13;48:15;"It was like week two."
48:15;48:17;"Man, I'd love to know what that conversation was."
48:17;48:21;"Was Bob just straight up-- he just looked around and was like, ""Now's the time."""
48:21;48:24;"I mean, he's probably going to release an album that year anyway, but who knows."
48:24;48:29;"'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63."
48:29;48:34;"A day that would have haunted him for me."
48:35;48:39;"President Kennedy was a right lie."
48:39;48:43;"Good day to be living and a good day to die."
48:43;48:47;"He led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb."
48:47;48:51;"He said, ""Wait a minute, boys. You know who I am."""
48:51;48:56;"""Of course we do. We know who you are."""
48:56;49:00;"Then he blew off his head while he was still in the car."
49:00;49:05;"Shot down like a dog in broad daylight."
49:05;49:10;"Was a matter of timing and the timing was right."
49:10;49:13;"You got unpaid debts?"
49:13;49:16;"We've come to collect."
49:16;49:20;"We're gonna kill you with hatred without any respect."
49:20;49:25;"Okay, we made it through a lot of boomer rock songs, but Jake just found one that we can't ignore."
49:25;49:30;"So before we get to the top five, let's throw this one on real quick. You want to introduce it, Jake?"
49:30;49:33;"It's called ""This Too Shall Pass."""
49:33;49:36;"Mike Love featuring John Stamos."
49:36;49:40;"I mean, we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, but we..."
49:40;49:44;"Let's just go to some dark aesthetic territory."
49:51;49:55;"We all remember when school was out."
49:55;49:58;"Was a cause for celebrations."
49:58;50:04;"Nobody ever even thought about closing down entire nations."
50:04;50:08;"Washing hands, preparing the mess."
50:08;50:11;"And it's not even Halloween."
50:11;50:14;"Shaking hands is a thing of the past."
50:14;50:17;"Due to social distancing."
50:17;50:21;"People are wondering how long it'll last."
50:21;50:25;"As the saying goes, ""This too shall pass."""
50:25;50:28;"Well, I believe the best is yet to come."
50:28;50:34;"So let's get back to having fun, fun, fun in the sun."
50:34;50:36;"Okay, this is a little more posi-core."
50:36;50:37;"Yeah."
50:37;50:39;"He's like, ""This sucks. This is a bummer."""
50:39;50:41;"So when did this come out?"
50:41;50:43;"Oh, this is like May last year."
50:43;50:47;"This is like the original ""Easy Sleazy."""
50:47;50:50;"First responders and the National Guard."
50:50;50:53;"Doctors and nurses all working real hard."
50:53;50:54;"Right on, Mike."
50:54;50:56;"It's kind of like a viral Super Bowl."
50:56;51:00;"So do unto others what's good for the soul."
51:00;51:03;"All 50 states with a unified goal."
51:03;51:07;"God bless America, that's how we roll."
51:07;51:09;"People are wondering how long it'll last."
51:09;51:13;"As the saying goes, ""This too shall pass."""
51:13;51:16;"Well, I believe the best is yet to come."
51:16;51:22;"So let's get back to having fun, fun, fun in the sun."
51:22;51:27;"I love the phasing on those ""fun, fun, fun"" harmonies."
51:27;51:28;"This is pretty inspired, I gotta say."
51:28;51:31;"We're turning lemons into lemonade."
51:31;51:34;"Just be cautious, don't be afraid."
51:34;51:36;"Oh, it's John Stamos on drums."
51:36;51:38;"Probably harmonies, too."
51:38;51:42;"The sooner we do, this pandemic will end."
51:42;51:44;"Stamos has a weird career."
51:44;51:47;"Full House and the Beach Boys drummer."
51:47;51:48;"I still don't understand."
51:48;51:49;"That's a weird career."
51:49;51:52;"He met the Beach Boys on Full House, and then they hired him?"
51:52;51:53;"Or he had a pre-existing--"
51:53;51:54;"Is that what happened?"
51:54;51:56;"Or did he know them already, and that's why they came on?"
51:56;52:00;"I remember there was an episode of Full House with the Beach Boys in it."
52:00;52:01;"Yeah, it's classic."
52:01;52:02;"And it was like--"
52:02;52:05;"Did he bring them on because he already knew them from playing music?"
52:05;52:07;"Right."
52:07;52:09;"Was Brian on that episode?"
52:09;52:11;"No, I don't think so."
52:11;52:12;"Well, actually, what am I saying?"
52:12;52:14;"Maybe he could have been."
52:14;52:18;"Mike Love became friends with John Stamos"
52:18;52:22;"back when John Stamos was on General Hospital in 1982."
52:22;52:27;"According to Love, the beloved actor had always been a huge fan"
52:27;52:31;"and was even the main ingredient behind the Beach Boys movie getting made,"
52:31;52:35;"as well as the 2000 TV miniseries he produced both."
52:35;52:39;"So basically, he was a soap opera star that met a Beach Boy."
52:39;52:40;"They hit it off."
52:40;52:42;"And was just like, ""Hey, dude."""
52:42;52:43;"""I'm a big fan."""
52:43;52:46;"You know, Dennis Wilson just died two years ago."
52:46;52:49;"His solo record from '80 is amazing."
52:49;52:51;"I wonder if Mike Love--"
52:51;52:56;"or if John Stamos really knows the deep Beach Boys stuff."
52:56;52:58;"You know, the Beach Boys Holland."
52:58;53:00;"Beach Boys love you."
53:00;53:01;"Well, you know something?"
53:01;53:04;"If we're going there, I've always found this interesting."
53:04;53:07;"As I recall on Full House, there's an episode--"
53:07;53:12;"I don't know if it involves the Beach Boys or it involves him and his band."
53:12;53:14;"They have a hit song."
53:14;53:18;"And the song is an old Beach Boys song called ""Forever."""

53:22;53:25;"♪ I'd talk forever ♪"
53:25;53:26;"Wait, bring that up. That song rules."
53:26;53:27;"Yeah, it's a great song."
53:27;53:33;"So anyway, in the episode, they use that song to be Uncle Jesse's hit."
53:33;53:36;"And he gets big in Japan and all this stuff."
53:36;53:38;"So, you know, I remember being a kid seeing that and being like,"
53:38;53:42;"""This is kind of a good song that somebody wrote for Full House."""

56:02;56:08;"So when he was on General Hospital in the early '80s, he went to a Beach Boys concert,"
56:08;56:14;"but he got recognized and chased and ended up hiding backstage where he ran into the band."

56:40;56:44;"Yeah, Stamos then got on stage, played with the band on Barbara Ann,"
56:44;56:46;"and they've been friends ever since."
56:46;56:48;"I didn't even know if he played an instrument."
56:48;56:50;"I guess Stamos left some."
56:50;56:51;"I said, ""Get that guy on stage."" Stamos was like, ""Whoa!"""
56:51;56:53;"And he's like, ""All right, what do you play, Stamos?"""

57:15;57:17;"You can find that on archive.org."

57:21;57:28;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
57:28;57:32;"So we were thinking for the top five this week,"

57:39;57:42;"We're going to compare the top five country hits right now"
57:42;57:45;"to the top five songs on the country charts in 1964."
57:45;57:47;"Why 1964?"
57:47;57:53;"That was the first year that Van Morrison put out a record with them."
57:53;57:55;"""Here comes the night."""
57:55;57:58;"And then the Stones put out their first record in '64."

01:00:00;01:00:01;"Geez."
01:00:01;01:00:05;"And he was a huge drinker, and just bad combo."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Damn."
01:00:06;01:00:11;"And he played a gig New Year's Eve and then died early the next morning in the back of a car."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"God."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Isn't that so messed up?"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Yeah."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Heavy."
01:00:15;01:00:20;"Great song, great singing from a young Hank Williams Jr."
01:00:20;01:00:26;"The number five song-- I wonder if with country this is going to be crazy whiplash, the sounds."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"Oh, I'm sure."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"It's going to be wild."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Or maybe not."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"The number five song, Luke Combs, ""Forever After All."""
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Don't know much about him."

01:00:33;01:00:37;"[MUSIC - LUKE COMBS, ""FOREVER AFTER ALL""]"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"This is way louder."
01:00:39;01:00:47;"I heard some Matchbox 20 today, and I was like, Matchbox 20 paved the way so deeply for modern country."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"Totally."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"I'm sure there's so many Nashville dudes that probably love Rob Thomas."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"I mean, he is a great songwriter, but even the vibe of the music."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Just that intro."

01:01:35;01:01:37;"Oh, this is a wife song."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Yep."
01:01:38;01:01:42;"You could write a generic love song, and not to say it couldn't be done, but my wife's"
01:01:42;01:01:47;"impact on my life has weighed heavily on the outcome of these songs."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"OK."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"It's a wife song."
01:01:49;01:01:52;"That's such funny phrasing."
01:01:52;01:01:57;"My wife's impact on my life has weighed heavily on the outcome of these songs."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Very strange."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"All right, pause it for a second."
01:01:59;01:02:04;"I think we were kind of talking over the first verse, but the lyrics are pretty tight."

01:02:06;01:02:09;"A good truck's got maybe 300,000."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Generous."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"You only get so much until it's gone."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Wait, that's how much a good truck weighs?"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"No, no, no."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"300,000 miles."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"Miles."
01:02:18;01:02:22;"Like, after that, you're sort of a beater."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Oh, OK."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"That's pushing it."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"300,000 miles is..."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"Oh, I think he should have specified miles, because I thought we were still talking about"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"ounces from the first line."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"A good cold beer's got 12 ounces."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Yeah, because you know, he's like..."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"A good truck's got..."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"300,000."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"I mean, of course, yeah, that makes more sense."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Of course, you guys are right, but OK."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"You only get so much until it's gone."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"But still, I like that."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"Again, it is amazing."
01:02:45;01:02:50;"Like, good country writers, you would think, like, how much more could you say about a"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"bottle of beer and a truck?"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"I know."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Like, how?"
01:02:54;01:02:58;"How is there anything left to say in, like, whether it's a love song, a party song, and"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"then somebody's, like, sitting there, and they're just like, well, what if we talk about"
01:03:01;01:03:05;"the ways that, you know, a bottle of beer and a truck only last so long?"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"OK, how are we going to hit that?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Well, you could look at it numerically."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"All right, damn."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Still squeezing something out of there."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"What if you're drinking a Tallboy, though, dude?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"It's like, a good beer could have 16 ounces."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"It could have, you know, 22 ounces."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"That's right."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"Duracells and Imagolite."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"That jumped out at me."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"I heard him say something about Duracells."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"Duracells and Imagolite, yeah, that doesn't last forever."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"A needle drop on a 45 are the kind of things that only last so long."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"OK?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Talking about records."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"These are good lyrics."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Just straight up."
01:03:36;01:03:39;"When the new wears off and they get to getting old, sooner or later, time's going to take"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"its toll."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"True."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"But then he and his wife are still together."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"The way the moonlight dances in your eyes, just a t-shirt in the kitchen with no makeup"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"and a million other things that I could look at my whole life."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"A love like that makes a man have second thoughts."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"Maybe some things last forever after all."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"They are really good lyrics."
01:03:55;01:04:01;"When you really think about the logic, just imagine being, you know, the wife and he's"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"like, ""You know, baby, I was thinking about something."""

01:04:24;01:04:27;"Well, it's heavy though because it's like..."
01:04:27;01:04:34;"If you think about a 12-ounce beer as some sort of analogous symbol for a marriage, because"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"both are finite."

01:04:38;01:04:40;"A marriage hopefully will last decades."
01:04:40;01:04:44;"And it's sort of like, ""Okay, we've been married for eight years."

01:04:56;01:04:58;"Another 40 years, 50 years."""
01:04:58;01:05:01;"Then the beer's getting a little warm."

01:05:07;01:05:08;"Yeah."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Right?"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"If you look at the marriage as a beer."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Okay."

01:08:55;01:08:56;"The Beatles actually covered Buck Owens."
01:08:56;01:09:01;"I bet if you were a little older, like in your early 20s, in the mid-60s,"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"and maybe you had listened to Buck Owens earlier,"

01:09:08;01:09:11;"you had more of like a wide-angle view of it all."

01:09:15;01:09:19;"through Ed Sullivan, you might not have been hip to Buck."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"Yeah, maybe just lived in a different world."

01:11:48;01:11:53;"Leave your cares behind"
01:11:53;01:11:57;"Welcome to my world"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Compare this to the Buck Owens."
01:11:59;01:12:03;"Buck Owens is like way closer to rock and roll."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"Yeah, way more energy."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Not so formal."
01:12:08;01:12:12;"Knock and the door will open"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"Yeah, this is kind of a snooze fest."
01:12:14;01:12:15;"Right."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"If you're hearing this on the radio all the time,"
01:12:17;01:12:21;"I can picture being super psyched about the Stones and the Beatles."
01:12:21;01:12:24;"Reeves was a gifted athlete and received a scholarship to play baseball"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"at the University of Texas."
01:12:26;01:12:29;"He left school after six weeks to work in the shipyards in Houston,"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"but returned to baseball,"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"later on playing semi-professional baseball before joining the St."
01:12:34;01:12:38;"Louis Cardinals farm team in 1944 as a right-handed pitcher."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"He played in the minor leagues for three years before severing his sciatic"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"nerve while pitching."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"All right."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"I'm not mad at it, but you know,"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"I think there's much to say about this one."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"I wonder if he died in a plane wreck going to like a gig,"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"like Buddy Holly style."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Yeah, I wonder."
01:12:54;01:13:00;"Welcome to my world"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"I do like this piano."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"For sure."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"The spirit of the song is a little bit."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Welcome to my life."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"Welcome to my life."
01:13:12;01:13:13;"Yeah."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"I mean, the truth is a bit of a snooze fest, not bad."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"I didn't really look at the lyrics too much."
01:13:18;01:13:23;"Welcome to my world."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"Welcome to my world."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"Once you come on in miracles, I guess,"
01:13:26;01:13:30;"still happen now and then step into my heart, leave your cares behind."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Welcome to my world built with you in mind, knocking the door will open."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"Seeking you will find asking you'll be given the key to this world of mine."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"I'll be waiting here with my arms unfurled waiting just for you."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"Welcome to my world."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Very vague."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"Yeah."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Honestly."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Yeah."
01:13:45;01:13:46;"You know, welcome to my house."
01:13:46;01:13:47;"I was just going to say that."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"The thing about country music."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"I think one of the things that I've learned is that you can't just"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"say welcome to my house."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"The thing about country music."
01:13:55;01:13:59;"I think one of its defining things is like the specificity of the lyrics."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"And usually they stick hard to the metaphor, like the last two that we heard."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"I mean, obviously this is a different era."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"It's kind of like a mixed metaphor."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"Welcome to my world."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Step into my heart."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Knocking the door will open."
01:14:09;01:14:14;"So you're stepping into the heart in the world with a--"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"and you knock on a door."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"I don't know."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"It's no welcome to my house."
01:14:19;01:14:23;"Well, welcome to my house is about coming to somebody's house."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"And just popping champagne."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Back to the modern day charts, number three."
01:14:28;01:14:33;"An old favorite of Time Crisis, Chris Stapleton with Starting Over."
01:14:33;01:14:37;"This is a song that came out last year, and I guess it's kind of heating up again."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Is he an old favorite?"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"Well, I just remember we listened to him like real early on."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Tennessee whiskey."
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Great recall."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Kind of long intro."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Not a fan of Chris Stapleton."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"You're not?"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"No."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Well, the road rolls out like a welcome sign."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Ugh."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"He can sing."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"To a better place than the one we're at."
01:15:02;01:15:05;"I find it very affected, very contrived."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Whoa."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Harsh words."
01:15:10;01:15:13;"I've had all of this town I can stand."

01:15:26;01:15:29;"We've been saving for a rainy day."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"I got to get these lyrics up, though."
01:15:31;01:15:37;"Let's beat the storm and be on our way."
01:15:37;01:15:42;"It don't matter to me wherever we are is where I want to be."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"And only for once in our lives we'll"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"take our chances and roll the dice."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"I kind of like this."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Is this used in a commercial?"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Because I feel like I don't know any part of it"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"other than the chorus."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"Yeah."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"Starting over."
01:16:06;01:16:11;"This might not be an easy time."
01:16:11;01:16:17;"There's rivers to cross and hills to climb."
01:16:17;01:16:22;"Some days we might fall apart."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"And some nights might feel--"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"You know, I'm surprised, Jake."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"I thought you might like-- it feels like a little bit"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"of a nod to some Rod Stewart."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"I'm getting more into it."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"It's true."
01:16:33;01:16:36;"If Rod Stewart had recorded this song in 1971,"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"I would probably love it."
01:16:39;01:16:44;"Some day we'll look back and smile."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"I was reading somewhere recently,"
01:16:46;01:16:50;"like, Rod Stewart said he had one influence."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"Yeah, what's that?"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Sam Cooke."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Whoa, interesting."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"He said, that's my only influence."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"OK."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"As a vocalist or just as an artist?"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Yeah, yeah, as a vocalist."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"OK."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Yeah, and I guess his voice is just so different"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"that he naturally brings a different texture to it."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"That was interesting."
01:17:08;01:17:12;"It's like, they both have kind of like a high rasp,"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"and they both have kind of like a light touch."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"It's like forced but light but controlled."
01:17:18;01:17:22;"I mean, Chris Stapleton has like a pretty heavy dose"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"of yarl to him."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Yeah."
01:17:25;01:17:29;"And that's a tough sell for me."
01:17:29;01:17:35;"I know I'm being like a annoying, like, picky music fan,"

01:17:55;01:17:56;"OK."
01:17:56;01:18:01;"Great songwriter, and there's a pretty famous"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"Willie Nelson record, songs for Lefty,"

01:26:24;01:26:26;"to own the recording."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"But obviously, it's a dangerous game, especially if you're talking"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"about something from back in the day."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"You're never going to recapture it."
01:26:32;01:26:36;"But it seems like, from what I've heard, she's having a lot of success"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"with these, so maybe the game's changed."
01:26:39;01:26:46;"This might be the first true, successful re-record campaign."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"A lot of times--"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"Well, maybe now it's easier just to completely replicate"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"what was there before."
01:26:53;01:26:58;"This song specifically, just for clarity, is not an original."
01:26:58;01:27:02;"This was from the Fearless Sessions, but it was never released."
01:27:02;01:27:05;"So it is not being compared to any--"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"So no one's even heard the original?"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Yeah."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Oh, OK, because I was really actually kind of--"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"I was kind of excited to compare and contrast."
01:27:16;01:27:20;"The Rolling Stones have re-recorded Exile on Main Street."
01:27:26;01:27:32;"Easy Sleazy was from the Exile Sessions."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"So this is a song she wrote back in the day for this album,"
01:27:35;01:27:38;"but just didn't ever release."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"2008."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"OK."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Everything was right."
01:27:43;01:27:48;"Mister, I've been waiting for you all my life."
01:27:48;01:27:55;"Mister, every single day until the end, I will be by your side."
01:27:55;01:27:59;"But that was when I got to know Mister Change of Heart."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Mister leaves me all alone."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"I fall apart."
01:28:02;01:28:06;"It takes everything in me just to get up each day,"
01:28:06;01:28:09;"but it's wonderful to see that you're OK."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Can we stop?"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"I'm very interested--"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Can we compare?"
01:28:12;01:28:15;"I'm very interested to hear one old and one new,"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"just from the audio quality."
01:28:17;01:28:20;"Is there any song you're particularly familiar with"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"that you have a history with, Ezra?"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Yeah, let's listen to Love Story."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"That was the first single."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"So let's listen to the original Love Story."
01:28:44;01:28:48;"We were both young when I first saw you."
01:28:48;01:28:52;"I close my eyes and the flashback starts."
01:28:52;01:28:59;"I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Play Taylor's version now."
01:29:03;01:29:10;"I read a review that they are nearly identical."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"Look at those pizzicato strings."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"We were both young when I first saw you."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"This is pretty identical."
01:29:21;01:29:24;"I close my eyes and the flashback starts."
01:29:24;01:29:32;"I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air."
01:29:32;01:29:36;"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,"
01:29:36;01:29:43;"see you make your way through the crowd and say hello."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"Does her voice sound any more mature?"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"I feel like it has a slightly deeper--"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"A little bit, a little, maybe a little deeper,"
01:29:50;01:29:53;"but she's a pretty consistent singer."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"Kind of like Van Morrison."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Yeah."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"Very consistent vocalist."
01:29:57;01:30:03;"I'm just lying on the staircase begging you please don't go."
01:30:03;01:30:09;"And I said, oh, we all take these from where we can be alone."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"I'll be lying on the staircase--"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"But she's essentially using the same technology"
01:30:12;01:30:16;"that she did in 2008, like computers."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Yeah, I'm sure they were using Pro Tools back then."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"So it's sort of like--"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Well done."
01:30:20;01:30:26;"Yeah, I mean, there's no reason why anybody would reject"
01:30:26;01:30:29;"that version and be like, nah, it's just not the same."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"The versions that we're talking about, which are always so tough,"
01:30:32;01:30:35;"like somebody who probably signed a bad record deal back in the day,"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"they had like, were one hit wonder 1968,"
01:30:38;01:30:41;"and then in like 1993, somebody came to them and was like,"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"you should rerecord it, and then at least you can make"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"a little more money, and they were just like,"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"all right, let's do this, and it's just, it's impossible."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"It's so rough."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"When we were hanging out the other day, Jake,"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"we had a conversation."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"You and Hannah were talking about how you'd been rewatching"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"the Godfather movies last Christmas or something,"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"and I don't know exactly how this came up,"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"but I was just like, okay, Francis Ford Coppola's"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"10 years younger."
01:31:09;01:31:13;"He tries to make the Godfather one in 1984."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"How's that panning out?"
01:31:14;01:31:17;"Oh, right. Right. It's not--"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"I mean, the Godfather, to me, obviously, incredible filmmaking,"
01:31:19;01:31:22;"but it's so much about the look of the film, too."
01:31:22;01:31:28;"Yeah, I mean, for whatever complex set of cultural aesthetic reasons,"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"you could not have made that movie in 1982."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"This was made in '72, I think, '71."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"Even if you were using the same cameras and stuff,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"I just don't-- yeah, it's just--"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"an artwork is like a product of its time."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"I guess the fact--"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"It's interesting--"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"Yeah."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"I was going to say, it's an interesting analysis of Taylor"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"that she can replicate it so easily."
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Right."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Her stuff is so sort of like--"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I don't think--"
01:31:53;01:31:54;"I mean, I'm not a big fan."
01:31:54;01:31:57;"I think it's very sterile, so it's sort of easy to replicate."
01:31:57;01:32:00;"Well, no, I would say she's written many, many great songs,"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"very iconic artists."
01:32:01;01:32:03;"I mean, the thing that I would say--"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"I actually don't think it reflects on her."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"I think you made the call earlier, Jake."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"It's the technology."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Anybody can do it."
01:32:09;01:32:10;"Right."
01:32:10;01:32:13;"It's easier than ever for anybody to kind of match stuff."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"It would even be easier now to do a sound-alike of something from the '60s."
01:32:16;01:32:20;"You get closer now than you could in 1992 just using plug-ins on Pro Tools."
01:32:20;01:32:21;"True."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"I think it's the technology and the thing that it makes--"
01:32:24;01:32:27;"So I really think if other artists wanted to do it,"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"they probably could."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"I don't know."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"Do you guys remember Def Leppard did this a few years ago?"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"I was just going to bring this up, Seinfeld."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"Def Leppard did this?"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"Because I always think of Def Leppard when this topic comes up"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"because they re-recorded ""Hysteria."""
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Matt, if you bring up ""Hysteria"" on Apple Music,"
01:32:45;01:32:48;"is it the original Mutt Lang production from '87,"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"or is it a re-record?"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"There's no way they're not going to have the original."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Well, Matt pulls that up."
01:32:54;01:32:58;"I was about to ask this with Taylor."
01:32:58;01:33:03;"Is she sort of powerful enough that she can get Apple to remove"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"the one that she doesn't own the masters for?"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"So when anyone goes and plays--"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"No."
01:33:10;01:33:12;"How would you know?"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"It would be like Chappelle saying,"
01:33:14;01:33:18;"""Netflix, I don't want you to keep my show on the air,"""
01:33:18;01:33:20;"and they acquiesced and then they did a deal."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"I think she could probably be powerful enough where she says,"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"""This is the version I want up."""
01:33:24;01:33:28;"It would be kind of a weird precedent because then technically,"
01:33:28;01:33:33;"if she doesn't own it, obviously it's understandable why it bothers her."
01:33:33;01:33:37;"I think she probably did this because it gives people an option"
01:33:37;01:33:41;"and probably these will supersede the old ones."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"The thought that I had too is that not only has the technology"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"stayed the same, but it's probably easier than ever"
01:33:45;01:33:50;"because we're in the endless cycles at the end of history,"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"as people sometimes say."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"We're in the post-internet--"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"This is some Dean Kisic stuff."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"Yeah, some Dean Kisic--"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"What if she just didn't even re-record it?"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"That's deep."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"She just put it out and said, ""This is my new version."""
01:34:03;01:34:04;"Dude, that is deep."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"That's like a weird--"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"You know what that is, Nick?"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Warhol messed up art prank."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"That's actually Borgesian."
01:34:11;01:34:13;"I know I say that all the time, but that's literally Borgesian"
01:34:13;01:34:18;"because one of his famous stories is about a guy just rewriting"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"Moby Dick or something."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"Because he was this early kind of dude pointing to these weird ideas"
01:34:23;01:34:27;"of authorship and meta-concepts and the idea of just like"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"if you just sat down and wrote something word for word,"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"does it become--"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Is there inherently something different because of the context?"
01:34:33;01:34:37;"But that would be pretty sick, Taylor's version."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Or if she did the--"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"Wait, who's the--"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"She did the Richard Prince argument"
01:34:42;01:34:46;"where they were just like, ""You just recorded your old record."""
01:34:46;01:34:48;"And released it."
01:34:48;01:34:52;"""You just did an eighth-inch jack out of your iPhone right into Pro Tools."""
01:34:52;01:34:56;"And she was like, ""By doing that, I create a new mode of authorship."""
01:34:56;01:35:00;"Very similar to Richard Prince's Instagram paintings."
01:35:00;01:35:03;"Well, yeah, because he would just print out Instagram posts onto canvas."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"He wasn't even doing paintings."
01:35:05;01:35:08;"They were just printouts onto canvas."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"All right, do you have the Def Leppard?"
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Can we A/B Def Leppard?"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"There's three different versions of it."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"There's Hysteria, Hysteria Super Deluxe Edition,"
01:35:17;01:35:20;"and Hysteria Deluxe Edition."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"So there's actually three versions."
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Does it say if there's a year--"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"Does it say if there's a re-record or a release date?"
01:35:29;01:35:32;"So there's-- It says release--"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"There's one that says August 3, 1987."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Okay, that's the original."
01:35:36;01:35:39;"There's one that says--"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"The Super Deluxe Edition also says 1987."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"And the Deluxe Edition says--"
01:35:45;01:35:48;"They all say 1987."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"Well, maybe it failed so hard."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Yeah, they just gave up."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"This is a very brutal Sonic assault."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"Can we start all three versions?"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Let's pick a-- Can we just--"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Let's do Pour Some Sugar On Me."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"Yeah, so here's the first version,"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"just the regular version."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"Okay."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"Step inside, walk this way,"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"you and me, babe."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Hey!"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"[laughs]"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"That's an insane vocal approach."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"Step inside!"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"That's an amazing intro."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"Yeah, we like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"Living like a lover with a red-eye phone."
01:36:30;01:36:33;"Looking like a tramp, like a video game."
01:36:33;01:36:37;"Unless you want it, can I be your man?"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"Resonate, dazzle, and infatuate me."
01:36:44;01:36:47;"Okay, here's the Super Deluxe version."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"Step inside, walk this way,"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"you and me, babe."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"Hey!"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Sounds pretty similar."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"[laughs]"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Wait, it's not a re-record."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"No, it's not a re-record."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Hold on, I gotta Google this."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"You gotta find the re-record."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Let me see if I can find it, hang on."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"Here's the Deluxe Edition."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"Step inside, walk this way,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"you and me, babe."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"Hey!"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"What's he saying, ""Dua-lee-pay""?"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"[laughs]"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Sounds like he's saying, ""You and me, babe."""
01:37:18;01:37:19;"Dua-lee-pay."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Dua-lee-pay."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Wait, what are we listening to?"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Okay."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Oh my God."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"This is the Deluxe Version."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"I think this is all the same."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"It's all the same, right?"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"It's remastered."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"Wait, I'm trying to get to the bottom of this."
01:37:40;01:37:43;"Def Leppard released a new re-recorded version of Hysteria"
01:37:43;01:37:46;"on this date in 2013,"
01:37:46;01:37:49;"ahead of their first Las Vegas residency."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"Oh!"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Oh, no intro."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Maybe they thought the intro was too hard."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"So this is from 2013?"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Sounds like he's saying, ""Phone."""
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Gonna be up!"
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Yeah, so the fans were not feeling this."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"It's just the uncanny valley, right?"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Although this is not a million miles away."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Just off enough."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Okay, that wasn't terrible."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"But what was the time?"
01:38:23;01:38:26;"How many years had passed since the original to the re-recorded?"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Exactly, decades."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"If you've been listening to Hysteria for decades,"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"and then there's a version that's slightly different,"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"it's gonna drive you insane."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"There's no way that that's gonna work."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"It's tough."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"You gotta be at the end of history to pull it off."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Def Leppard was like 10 years too early."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Yeah, 10 years too early."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"They should do it again."
01:38:46;01:38:50;"They could recreate the 2012 one pretty well, I bet."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Do you think that they did?"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"We're having a hard time recreating the '80s,"
01:38:54;01:38:58;"but we're positive we could do a 2021 version of the 2012 version."
01:38:58;01:39:04;"Did they lose the intro because the isolated vocals,"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"there's just no way to match?"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"Oh, 'cause their voices sound so different?"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Yeah, I feel like maybe they--"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"Why didn't they?"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"I feel like they tried and they were just like,"
01:39:13;01:39:16;"""It doesn't sound good. Let's just cut the intro."""
01:39:16;01:39:20;"That's also crazy just to cut the intro for the re-record."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"Step inside!"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Wait, wait, wait. To your earlier point,"
01:39:24;01:39:28;"what if they just sampled the intro from the original track"
01:39:28;01:39:31;"and then what, they would have had to pay royalties"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"just for that one snippet to the original record company?"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"It would defeat the purpose."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"They'd have to go to the same record label to clear it"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"and they'd say, ""Go f*** yourself."""
01:39:39;01:39:45;"Would it cost less if the record label was like, ""Sure."""
01:39:45;01:39:48;"'Cause they're not sampling the entire song."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"I don't see it happening."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"All right."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"They had a very contingent relationship at that point,"
01:39:54;01:39:57;"so it was gonna be an uphill battle."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"Okay, the number one song."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"God, I love that."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"The Borghesean nature of Def Leppard."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"The number one song this week in 1964,"
01:40:07;01:40:10;"Johnny Cash, ""Understand Your Man."""
01:40:10;01:40:12;"Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright."""
01:40:14;01:40:17;"Oh, interesting."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"This is five years before they collaborated"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"on ""Nashville Skyline."""
01:40:21;01:40:31;"Oh, there it is."
01:40:31;01:40:48;"This is part two."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Oh, it's like the same song."
01:40:51;01:40:57;"Interesting, he said he played this to an audience in 2003,"
01:40:57;01:41:00;"and prior to playing it, he said he had not played the song"
01:41:00;01:41:01;"in 25 years."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Ooh, deep bust out."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"That's real deep."
01:41:05;01:41:11;"That's the cool thing about it."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"It's like, ""Oh, I'm gonna play this song."""
01:41:16;01:41:20;"That's the cool thing about a vampire show in 25 years."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Busting out."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"We haven't played Hannah Hunt in 25 years."
01:41:23;01:41:27;"That was the last song he ever performed"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"in front of an audience."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Oh, it was?"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"Yeah."
01:41:31;01:41:38;"I guess one thing you can say about Bob Dylan,"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"because people always called him out,"
01:41:39;01:41:42;"because a lot of his early songs heavily borrowed melodies"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"from other stuff."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"But he doesn't have songwriting on this,"
01:41:46;01:41:49;"so maybe he was like, ""All right, do your thing, Johnny."""
01:41:49;01:41:50;"I can't say sh*t."
01:41:50;01:41:59;"It's really such cool, weird music,"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"just like so little is happening."
01:42:01;01:42:06;"Makes me think of the Taco Bell commercial"
01:42:06;01:42:09;"that we were talking about a few weeks ago."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Wait, what was that?"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"The Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Oh my God, yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"Wait, what was the Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial?"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"It was like a dumb pun on cash, right?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"And he appeared in it?"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"He's in it, yeah."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"He's on camera in it."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"1992."
01:42:25;01:42:29;"Whoa, a '92 Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"It might be worth listening to."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"I think he's like--"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"Throw it on."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"♪ Well, nobody has more choices for just a little cash ♪"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"♪ You can search the whole world over ♪"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"♪ And no matter who you ask ♪"
01:42:41;01:42:45;"♪ They'll say Taco Bell has more choices for just a little cash ♪"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"♪ You better make a run for the border, son ♪"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"♪ You better make a border dash ♪"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"♪ We're talking under a dollar ♪"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"♪ Nobody beats Taco Bell ♪"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Wow."
01:42:55;01:42:59;"♪ Where else you gonna get so many choices with just a little cash ♪"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Great song."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Great performance by Johnny."
01:43:05;01:43:07;"I mean, you think of him, Johnny Cash,"
01:43:07;01:43:12;"his reputation and the culture is one of the most badass,"
01:43:12;01:43:18;"authentic, uncompromising, true country stars."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"I love it."
01:43:19;01:43:23;"He's just singing the words, ""Taco Bell."""
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Little cash."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"He's in the commercial, too."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"I love it."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"But it's also--"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"They're using his name."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"He's also like, ""You can use my name."""
01:43:33;01:43:35;"The pun on my name."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Full integration."
01:43:36;01:43:40;"He's an interesting character because he also hosted a television show."
01:43:40;01:43:44;"And he was a full-on showbiz guy, clearly."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"I just think by the standards of country,"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"he was like--"
01:43:47;01:43:50;"By the standards of this kind of fancy country world,"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"he was the rebel."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"But yeah, he was like--"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"He's an older dude."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"Yeah, he's not some punk rocker."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"That commercial's kind of funny because they picked Johnny Cash"
01:43:59;01:44:04;"because they have a lot of cheap food or something, a dollar menu."
01:44:04;01:44:08;"But it's this idea of where else can you get so much for just a little cash?"
01:44:08;01:44:12;"If his name was like dollar, it would make more sense."
01:44:12;01:44:15;"There's many places you can get some food for a little cash."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"There's something about--"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"It doesn't quite fit."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Yeah."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Or if his name was like little money."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"When you come to Taco Bell, you only need a little money."
01:44:23;01:44:26;"He's like, ""At Taco Bell, you just need a little cash."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"My last name's Cash."""
01:44:27;01:44:30;"And it's like, yeah, especially in 1992,"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"you would use cash to purchase food anywhere."
01:44:32;01:44:38;"I'm failing to see what makes the Taco Bell cash connection unique."
01:44:38;01:44:41;"If his last name was pocket change, it would be better."
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Yes, because at Taco Bell, I don't know, 1992,"
01:44:43;01:44:46;"could you get a 49-cent taco or something?"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"It's 2 AM, you're walking through the drive-thru."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"They tell you that it's--"
01:44:52;01:44:56;"The indoor dining is closed."
01:44:56;01:45:00;"Sir, you need a vehicle to walk on through the drive-thru."
01:45:00;01:45:04;"So you're telling me the dining room is closed."
01:45:04;01:45:08;"And if I don't have a car, then I can't go through the drive-thru."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Well, how does that make any sense?"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Is this Johnny Cash's COVID lockdown song?"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Is that--"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Yeah, basically."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"--what's happening?"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"No, the drive-thru--"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Sir, the dining room closed at 10 PM."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"And now it's 1 10 AM."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Oh, yeah, this is just late night."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"The dining room is closed."
01:45:25;01:45:28;"All right, the number one song right now on the country charts."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"This dude's trying to walk through the drive-thru."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"Walking through the drive-thru."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"The number one song this week."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"I just have to say one thing real quick before you do it."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"The commercial itself is so vibey."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"It's so awesome."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"It looks like a Jake painting."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"It's of a TV."
01:45:48;01:45:51;"They're filming a TV out in the desert."
01:45:51;01:45:58;"And so you're just sort of pushing in on a TV with Johnny Cash on the TV."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"It's really--"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"It's like a music video."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"It's Borghesean."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Okay."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Everybody check that out."
01:46:04;01:46:09;"The number one song this week on the country charts is Gabby Barrett."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"It's called ""The Good Ones."""
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Not familiar."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"She said that her husband was the inspiration for this."
01:46:22;01:46:26;"It's a lot of husband and wife songs."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"All of them."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"She's definitely got a post-Taylor delivery."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Or maybe I'm missing some of the shared DNA."
01:46:46;01:46:51;"One of the songwriters and producers is a guy named Zach Kale."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Which is a cool name."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Kale."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"K-A-L-E."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:00;01:47:08;"It is interesting, Ezra, that at least three of the five songs are about someone's spouse."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"It's not young."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"It's not boyfriends or girlfriends."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Or partners."
01:47:12;01:47:17;"Yeah, I wonder if that's a wave or if country's always been a little more like husbands and wives."
01:47:46;01:47:49;"All these modern country songs, they're actually interestingly similar."
01:47:49;01:47:58;"Where you're kind of just listing a bunch of stuff in the verses, and then the chorus is about the actual relationship."
01:47:58;01:48:01;"So, he's a phone call to his parents."
01:48:01;01:48:03;"He's a Bible by the bed."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"He's the song stuck in my head."
01:48:07;01:48:11;"He's solid and he's steady like the Allegheny runs."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Or like the river."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Allegheny River runs solid and steady."
01:48:14;01:48:17;"He knows just where he's going and he's proud of where he's from."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"All right, she's saying that her husband's a good one."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Interesting line."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"He's a phone call to his parents."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"He's a Bible by the bed."
01:48:25;01:48:27;"He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing."
01:48:27;01:48:30;"I guess she's saying like he's just like a good dude who calls his parents."
01:48:30;01:48:33;"And the dude has a Bible by the bed?"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"Or he's like as good as a Bible by the bed?"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Yeah, I'm confused as well."
01:48:38;01:48:42;"I mean, phone call to parents is like a funny thing."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"Phone call to parents is like a funny opening line."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"He's responsible."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"Right, he's responsible."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Good relationship with his family."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"And to Christ."
01:48:52;01:48:55;"And I guess she's wearing a T-shirt that he gave her."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"Second verse."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"You'll know him when you see him by the way he looks at me."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"You'd say he hung the moon."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"I'd say he hung the galaxy."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Nobody does it better."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"Oh, the way he pulls me in."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"I've known a couple bad ones, but they led me all to him."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"He's one of the good ones."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"Okay, obviously we get with the song."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"It's the phone call to the parents."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Interesting way to start."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"But yeah, this kind of feels--"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"I already forgot the names of what we already listened to."
01:49:18;01:49:23;"But this kind of feels like a gender-swapped version of"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Jake Owen made for you."
01:49:25;01:49:28;"Definitely something in the air over there in Nashville."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"You know what's funny?"
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I feel like that first time we did that top five modern country,"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"it was like really strong."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"All winners."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"I'm not saying any of this is bad, but this is like a little samey."
01:49:40;01:49:43;"Well, I feel like they were also like real party songs."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Like dudes just like pounding brews by the lake."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"Yeah, maybe those will start kicking off in a couple months with summer."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"We need some lake songs."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"This is some like late COVID."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"This is really domestic."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"Oh, you know what?"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Is this wedding season?"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Is April classic wedding month or more May?"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"May, June."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Yeah, June."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Okay."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"I think it's late COVID, man."
01:50:03;01:50:08;"People have been like cooped up and they're appreciating their"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"domestic partnerships, man."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Not Mick Jagger."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"He's ready to go out and party."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"No one's hanging out on a -- no one wants to hear about people hanging"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"out on a floating dock."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"But I do, and that's why I respect Mick."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Yeah, Mick just wants to go party."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"Mick's like, ""I'm ready to rage, dude."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"I'm 79."
01:50:24;01:50:25;"I don't care."""
01:50:25;01:50:28;"Mick's probably only got, you know, so many hardcore party years left."
01:50:28;01:50:31;"Most of the people in their late 70s probably already done with the"
01:50:31;01:50:34;"hardcore party scene, but, you know, Mick's probably got a solid 10."
01:50:34;01:50:39;"Well, he seems like a guy that really takes care of himself."
01:50:39;01:50:44;"I think of him like he either doesn't drink or he drinks like four times"
01:50:44;01:50:45;"a year."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"That's interesting."
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Actually, you know what's crazy?"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"This is a weird memory."
01:50:48;01:50:52;"When I lived in San Francisco, I did grocery delivery out of this"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Whole Foods."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"I think we've talked about this."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"I used to see Kirk Hammett in the Whole Foods."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"Uh-huh."
01:50:57;01:51:03;"Well, so there was this occasional delivery of granola, weird"
01:51:03;01:51:09;"Whole Foods granola and I forget what it was, almond milk or something,"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"to the Four Seasons."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"It happened a few times a year."
01:51:13;01:51:17;"My boss was like, ""Oh, dude, are you doing that granola delivery to the"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Four Seasons?"""
01:51:18;01:51:19;"I was like, ""Yeah."""
01:51:19;01:51:20;"He's like, ""That's Mick Jagger."""
01:51:20;01:51:21;"Oh, my God."
01:51:21;01:51:22;"I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
01:51:22;01:51:23;"Whoa."
01:51:23;01:51:24;"This is incredible."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"How did this never come up before?"
01:51:25;01:51:26;"I don't know."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
01:51:28;01:51:31;"He's like, ""Dude, every time Mick's in town, it's a few times a year."
01:51:31;01:51:35;"He stays at the Four Seasons downtown San Francisco and he just will"
01:51:35;01:51:38;"order granola from us."""
01:51:38;01:51:39;"I'm like, ""Really?"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"How do you know?"""
01:51:41;01:51:45;"Was it the granola from the bulk with a shovel?"
01:51:45;01:51:49;"Yeah, it's just flax seeds and all this kind of stuff."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"Right."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"Today, Mick would just have his brands dialed in and somebody would just"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"go do a run for him."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Wait, what year was this?"
01:51:55;01:52:00;"Yeah, this was like 2005 or 2006 or something."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"This is like prepackaged bulk granola?"
01:52:03;01:52:08;"You'd get it in a little container and it's like there's no real label on it?"
01:52:08;01:52:09;"Yeah, yeah."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"It's like a whole food bag."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"It's the Whole Foods."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"Exactly."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Okay."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"I wasn't doing the shopping."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I would come back and there'd be a delivery."
01:52:17;01:52:21;"Usually, a grocery delivery would have been a few bags with a bunch of"
01:52:21;01:52:26;"stuff and this would just be one paper Whole Foods bag with just a bulk"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"plastic bag of granola in it."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Generic."
01:52:29;01:52:34;"It was going to the Four Seasons and I was just like, people that would"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"extravagantly order just one thing."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"And would you just leave it at the reception desk?"
01:52:39;01:52:40;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:52:40;01:52:41;"Of course."
01:52:41;01:52:44;"It was just under some name at the Four Seasons, but my boss was like,"
01:52:44;01:52:45;"""That's Mick Jagger, dude."""
01:52:45;01:52:46;"Right."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"Especially back then, I bet the delivery fee cost significantly more than"
01:52:49;01:52:50;"the item."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"Just one bag of granola."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"Oh, yeah."
01:52:52;01:52:53;"For sure."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"You didn't roll up to the desk and say, ""You know, I would be very happy to"
01:52:56;01:52:59;"bring it directly up to Mr. Jagger."""
01:52:59;01:53:01;"[Laughter]"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"I did not do that."
01:53:03;01:53:08;"I kind of thought my boss was full of s***, but I also thought maybe he was"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"-- I thought it was 50/50 he was right."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"It was his company."
01:53:12;01:53:18;"He must have been engaging with Mick's tour manager or handler or whatever."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"Personal assistant."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"It's not impossible."
01:53:20;01:53:21;"No, it's not impossible."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"Right, because this is a third party."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"You're not working for Whole Foods."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Exactly."
01:53:25;01:53:31;"I was working for ShopHoppers, which is a grocery delivery service in San"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"Francisco."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"You'd call a phone number?"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"No, you would send an email."
01:53:36;01:53:42;"I worked for this guy that was this blues guitarist guy in San Francisco."
01:53:42;01:53:47;"Yeah, and he was a musician guy, but he had this company that he ran."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"He'd been running since the '90s."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"It was grocery delivery."
01:53:50;01:53:53;"People would call or email grocery orders."
01:53:53;01:53:57;"Do you think his musician background gave him a bit more of the inside track"
01:53:57;01:54:01;"as far as knowing that it was Mick Jagger?"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"Oh, yeah, it's like he knew the manager or something like that."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"I don't know."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Maybe he jammed with Mick."
01:54:07;01:54:12;"What was weird, his office was above this really cool old guitar store in San"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Francisco."
01:54:13;01:54:19;"One time I did meet Joe Satriani because I came back from a run, and then my"
01:54:19;01:54:22;"boss, Chris, was just hanging out."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"I was like, ""Oh, where are you, man?"""
01:54:24;01:54:26;"He's like, ""Oh, I'm down in the guitar shop down below my office."""
01:54:26;01:54:30;"Then I went down there waiting for another order to come in."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"It was just one of those crusty guitar shop style vibes."
01:54:33;01:54:36;"He was just hanging out with this dude named Joe, and they were just talking"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"about guitars and gear."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"He's like, ""Oh, this is my buddy Joe."""
01:54:40;01:54:41;"I was like, ""Oh, hey, I'm Jake."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"What's up?"""
01:54:42;01:54:43;"We were just kind of hanging out."
01:54:43;01:54:47;"Then later he's like, ""Dude, that was Joe Satriani."""
01:54:47;01:54:49;"He's an old friend."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"I was like, ""Oh, cool, man."""
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Wow."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Joe Satriani."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"I'm on the old shop hopper's website."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"Oh, are you?"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"Oh, that's nice."
01:54:57;01:55:02;"Our fees are generally between $25 and $45 for a shopping and delivery to your"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"house."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"I mean, that's so expensive."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"Because back then it was just so luxurious."
01:55:08;01:55:11;"Yeah, this is a luxury operation."
01:55:11;01:55:18;"Yeah, so Mick got a $4 bag of granola, throw down $40 for Jake's delivery."
01:55:18;01:55:23;"Well, also, Nick, this entry was posted on October 11, 2013."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Oh, okay."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"I wonder if he's still in business."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"They're real behind the eight ball on that one, I think."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"They can't be."
01:55:29;01:55:32;"And Christopher Ford was your boss?"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Oh, yeah."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"They got a lot of competition these days."
01:55:35;01:55:39;"Imagine if just somehow, easy sleazy, there's just a random shop hopper's"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"reference."
01:55:40;01:55:46;"I can't wait to get back out, go to San Francisco, hit up shop hoppers"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"with my favorite granola."
01:55:48;01:55:52;"Well, Jake, that's an amazing story."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Good note to end on."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"I don't know if it's amazing, but."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"It's an amazing."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"If you're a fan of Jake, it's an amazing story."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"Just Jake delivering the granola to Mick Jagger."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I think it's to Mick Jagger."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"Perhaps."
01:56:06;01:56:10;"When you throw in the uncertainty, 50/50, it does become a pretty"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"dislike."
01:56:11;01:56:16;"This show rolls just like, yo, you know, Jake may or may not have once"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"delivered Mick Jagger granola."
01:56:18;01:56:19;"Wait, why?"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"Because you saw him?"
01:56:20;01:56:23;"Well, no, just like a rumor at shop hoppers."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"And he just left it at the front desk."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"Oh, right."
01:56:28;01:56:35;"So, but it could have been his boss who was buddies with Joe Satriani"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"told him it was for Mick Jagger."
01:56:37;01:56:41;"Jake has no reason not to believe him."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"Yeah."
01:56:42;01:56:45;"Maybe one day you'll cross paths somehow and you can bring that up."
01:56:45;01:56:48;"He might remember that **** and be like, oh yeah, it's crazy."
01:56:48;01:56:52;"I used to drop $40 just to get my favorite granola in San Francisco."
01:56:52;01:56:55;"That's a good, great note to end on."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"All right."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"We'll see everybody next time."
01:56:59;01:57:00;"Shout out, Sir Mick."
01:57:00;01:57:02;"Thank you for the music."
01:57:02;01:57:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:57:06;01:57:09;"(electronic music)"
