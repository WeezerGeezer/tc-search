00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis."
00:02;00:04;"Back again."
00:04;00:07;"What's that sound?"
00:07;00:10;"Sounds like glass hitting the pavement."
00:10;00:15;"Oh, it's just the new album from Rolling Stones, Hackney Diamonds."
00:15;00:25;"All this, plus Major League Baseball, and the top hits of 1964 and today."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:36;"Time Crisis"
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"They were a belt from a knee, all my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"In a lonely bed"
01:19;01:22;"Alright, Time Crisis, back again."
01:22;01:26;"There's that classic first set energy."
01:26;01:28;"Oh yeah."
01:28;01:31;"I'm still tuning, I'm not ready."
01:31;01:34;"The band started, the band started without me."
01:34;01:39;"Everybody just kind of wandering onto the stage haphazardly."
01:39;01:41;"Did the Dead have set lists or not?"
01:41;01:43;"I'm not clear on this."
01:43;01:46;"They must have discussed what they're going to open with though."
01:46;01:48;"Or did Jerry just call it?"
01:48;01:53;"They must have been backstage being like, ""Okay, let's open with Johnny B. Goode and then we'll go into He's Gone."""
01:53;01:57;"Right? Or they just had no, they walked out with no plans."
01:57;02:04;"It's a good question about the first song because, I mean, they claim Jerry was just kind of making game time decisions throughout the show."
02:04;02:12;"And you can tell when you watch like a footage of an old show if he's kind of just like, you know, a song finishes and he's just..."
02:12;02:15;"And they're like, ""Okay."" And then they follow him."
02:15;02:16;"Yeah."
02:16;02:19;"But yeah, first song, that's a good question."
02:19;02:22;"You think they're walking in, no idea."
02:22;02:28;"Everybody gets their s*** together and then Jerry just starts playing something? It always starts with him?"
02:28;02:32;"I think there's shows that open with like a Bobby song sometimes."
02:32;02:37;"But you think Jerry just starts playing like a Bobby song, Bobby's like, ""Oh s***,"" walks up to the mic."
02:37;02:43;"I don't know. This is the whole query about the first song. I mean, I've always wondered this."
02:43;02:48;"I mean, I assume this is like common knowledge for the hardcore Dead."
02:48;02:49;"Oh yeah, I'm sure."
02:49;02:56;"This is funny. I'm reading a Steve Hoffman forum. It says, ""I don't think,"" obviously, grain of salt."
02:56;03:01;"This is somebody that might not know anything, but they said, ""I don't think they did set lists."
03:01;03:08;"I think they would say on stage something like, 'Hey, let's maybe do 'They Love Each Other' followed by 'Big River.'"""
03:08;03:09;"Okay."
03:09;03:15;"Maybe that's it. Maybe it's something super loose. As they're walking out, they have some starting, you know?"
03:15;03:19;"I'm picturing a funny guy. He's a Grateful Dead truther."
03:19;03:28;"And he's just like, ""Every set list was mapped out well in advance, and many of Jerry's solos were fully composed."""
03:28;03:33;"They didn't improvise at all. Yeah, if you Google it, it says they planned out the first song and the last song."
03:33;03:39;"Okay. Yeah, all right. See, that makes sense. Like you said, they plan out the first song, but you don't know what's coming after that."
03:39;03:42;"Yeah, it might be too awkward if they didn't plan out the first song."
03:42;03:49;"It'd just be like, ""Who's making the first move here?"" Or they start two different songs at the same time."
03:49;03:53;"Or there's a couple songs that are a little bit similar. Yeah, that could be a real train wreck."
03:53;03:59;"I like it when there's four minutes of silence between songs. Like if you're listening to a show."
03:59;04:03;"Oh, yeah. A little bit of tuning, a little bit just milling around."
04:03;04:06;"Jerry just being like, ""What should we do next?"""
04:06;04:11;"You know, we've done a few Richard Picture shows with no set lists. How'd that go?"
04:11;04:15;"Great. It's better for us to plan because then we all kind of blank out."
04:15;04:23;"We're like, ""What are the songs do we know?"" I don't know. I wonder if Jerry ever had any moments where he just completely blanked."
04:23;04:28;"Right. He was just like, ""Ah."" He's like, ""Man, I've been listening to a lot of Steely Dan lately."""
04:28;04:34;"But yeah, we don't know any of their songs. F*** Grateful Dead songs."
04:34;04:41;"Oh, speaking of Grateful Dead songs, Richard Pictures is playing November 2nd at Gold Diggers."
04:41;04:45;"Oh, nice. Anything new? Or maybe no spoilers?"
04:45;04:48;"No spoilers. But we're working on a few new ones."
04:48;04:50;"They never before played?"
04:50;04:54;"I think we're going to do one that they never played."
04:54;04:56;"Because it's not a Grateful Dead song?"
04:56;05:01;"Correct. It's one that they totally could have played, but didn't."
05:01;05:07;"Is that a first? Is a cover band for a band ever played songs that the band they're covering?"
05:07;05:13;"I'm sure other Grateful Dead cover bands have done this before, but it's called speculative fiction."
05:13;05:15;"[laughs]"
05:15;05:17;"It's a great one."
05:17;05:25;"Now everybody knows that Grateful Dead never covered Dirty Work by Steely Dan, but what Richard Pictures is asking is, ""What if they did?"""
06:14;06:16;"It's like The Man in the High Castle."
06:16;06:17;"Yeah."
06:17;06:25;"Exactly. How about you even take it a step further? I've never actually seen the show, read the book, Man in the High Castle. Have any of you guys?"
06:25;06:28;"I watched an episode or two. It's like where the Nazis win World War II."
06:28;06:42;"Yeah. And then I've seen the map that the US is divided into the Nazi East Coast and the Japanese West Coast. Can I get a number crunch? In The Man in the High Castle, what's
the Japanese Western US called?"
06:42;06:43;"We don't have Seinfeld here."
06:43;06:45;"Okay. That's on you, Nick."
06:45;06:47;"I'm on it."
06:47;06:48;"Oh, Seinfeld here?"
06:48;06:50;"Yeah. Can you hear me? My [beep] is all [beep] up."
06:50;06:52;"Okay. I can hear you."
06:52;06:54;"It's the Japanese Pacific States."
06:54;06:55;"Okay. Thank you."
06:55;07:03;"I can't see myself and I can't... When you said, ""Am I on this call?"" I was like, ""Am I on this call?"" That's where it's at for me. Anyway."
07:03;07:05;"This is going to be a trippy show."
07:05;07:06;"Yeah."
07:06;07:18;"How about this? Let's go one step further. We're a Grateful Dead cover band. We're not just one of those cover bands like Richard Pictures that might throw in a non-dead
song and speculate what would the dead have done with it."
07:18;07:29;"We're from the Philip K. Dick Man in the High Castle universe. So actually, our version of Grateful Dead is from the Japanese Pacific States. Is that what it...
Seinfeld?"
07:29;07:32;"It's the Japanese Pacific States. Yeah."
07:32;07:47;"So we're from Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco. Maybe they'd give that a new name. And we... Yeah. You know what? We're a bunch of American dudes. We grew up
under the Japanese flag, the Pacific States of Japanese Pacific States."
07:47;08:06;"After World War II, US lost the war, but it's all good. We're still out here playing good music, enjoying life under the control of Imperial Japan. Acid still made its
way to San Francisco in the 1960s, even under Japanese control."
08:06;08:29;"And as a kind of protest against the Imperial Japanese occupation, we still like to play a mix of kind of a heritage American music, drawn on elements of folk, country,
and blues. But we also break off a little bit of Japanese flavor in honor of the country that won World War II along with the Germans."
08:29;08:49;"And yeah, that's like our whole project is we're just kind of imagining what would the Grateful Dead sound like if the Axis won World War II? They'd probably have some
songs in Japanese. They'd probably be covering, have a different set of covers. I think it could be really fun."
08:49;08:51;"Maybe a garage rock influence?"
08:51;08:59;"Well, the Dead did have a garage rock influence. There's like a couple early Dead songs, I'd say are like pretty garagey."
08:59;09:00;"Cold Rain?"
09:00;09:14;"Yeah. And I find those are something on, even on working bands, it's got a little bit of garagey energy to me. But yeah, I think that's the next level for jam bands is to
also involve alternative history."
09:14;09:24;"And then maybe if it continues into now and they're in the Grateful Dead and Co. era of the cover bands, they have a J-pop singer instead of a John Mayer."
09:24;09:51;"Oh yeah. In this universe, John Mayer, of course, was never born. It's kind of dark, but... Yeah, because there have been... Jake, we've always talked about the fun of
kind of like speculating about having a Dead cover band that covered song. Wasn't that like a concept you had? A Dead cover band that covered non-Dead songs
exclusively in the style of the Grateful Dead?"
09:51;10:12;"Yeah. I mean, it's something we've thrown around. I mean, one time we did Althea into Plush by the Stone Temple Pilots back into Althea. We didn't do like full Plush. We
did like, we were in the middle of Althea, then we went into like the Plush riff and then we went into like the ""And I feel, and I feel..."" Or no, no, it goes into the..."
10:12;10:28;"Oh God, what's the... I can't remember how the middle part of Plush goes, but we did that once. Real novelty stuff. The one we're working on is like something they
totally could have done. It would not... Most people would probably be like, ""Oh, Jerry, JGB must have done that song."""
10:28;10:31;"Right. You're not picking a song from after Jerry died."
10:31;10:38;"No, no, no. But this, yeah, no, that was an idea we had of like, what if the Dead played like Salisbury Hill by Peter Gabriel? Like what if..."
10:38;10:39;"It's a great idea."
10:39;10:48;"What if the Dead had done like a Clash song? I also thought they could have done like Training Vein or something."
10:48;10:49;"Oh, totally."
10:49;11:13;"You say you stand by your man Tell me something I don't understand You said you loved me, and that's a fact And then you left me, said you felt trapped Well, some things you
can't explain away But the heartaches in me still this day"
11:13;11:21;"You didn't stand by me No, not at all You didn't stand by me No way"
11:21;11:31;"Jake, what's that Instagram account you love? You showed me and there was like a dude ripping a Jerry type solo for Dancing Queen by ABBA. And it made total sense."
11:31;11:34;"The Jerry Tone Store or something?"
11:34;11:57;"Right. So, you know, Jerry has such a distinctive style. It's like a solid guitarist can play something pretty cool. Like what if Jerry was playing, doing a version of
Dancing Queen? And it sounds accurate. And I told you guys about, I came across a, there's a jam band called Walrus. And their whole concept is they do Beatles songs, but
fully as like a Grateful Dead style jam band."
11:57;11:58;"Oh, really?"
11:58;12:04;"Yeah, they'll like, they'll stretch out like do like, you know, seven, eight minute and your bird can sing."
12:04;12:05;"Oh, I can see that."
12:05;12:06;"Just ripping some solos."
12:06;12:09;"Like, they had to do it. I picture it like it's slower."
12:09;12:12;"[Humming]"
12:12;12:22;"It makes a lot of sense because the Beatles don't jam. But there's obviously a lot of like jam band people who the Beatles are probably one of their, you know, all time
faves."
12:22;12:28;"Well, it's funny you say the Beatles because that's, I'll drop this hint. We're working on a Beatles song."
12:28;12:33;"Okay. Which definitely wasn't unheard of with the Dead or JGB, Dear Prudence."
12:33;12:35;"Yep. Totally."
12:35;12:49;"These are all great ideas, but I'm saying go one step further for the history buffs. I'm going to start a band that's the same concept as Walrus, but for some reason it
also involves America losing World War II."
12:49;12:50;"That's really deep."
12:50;12:52;"It's called Das Walrus."
12:52;13:00;"I think your audience would start to thin pretty quickly. That's a lot of homework."
13:00;13:14;"I was so excited to see an Allman Brothers type take on And Your Bird Can Sing, but there was swastikas everywhere and be like, hey guys, this is speculative fiction, man."
13:14;13:16;"They were singing in German too."
13:18;13:25;"Guys, this is speculative fiction. What do you want me to do? The US, in my universe, the US lost World War II. It f*cking sucks."
13:25;13:31;"All right, guys. You know, there's the Philip Roth book, The Plot Against America."
13:31;13:32;"I was just going to mention."
13:32;13:34;"That has a big old swastika on the front."
13:34;13:35;"Yeah."
13:35;13:44;"Okay. Maybe because of course, you're not going to get a lot of shows if there's swastikas on stage. Ours is just like slightly more eerie."
13:44;13:56;"And we're just like, we're a jam band that does Beatles songs. And in our universe, Charles Lindbergh was elected president of the United States."
13:56;13:59;"And just like, going to leave it at that."
14:03;14:08;"Well, what do you mean? What changed? Charles Lindbergh was president of the United States."
14:08;14:11;"He beat FDR. He beat FDR in the 1936 election."
14:11;14:19;"That's all we're saying. Well, how does that play out on stage? You know, we're still just regular guys wearing regular clothes."
14:19;14:25;"Just some of the in-between songs banter. There's a lot of thank you, President Lindbergh for keeping us out of World War II."
14:25;14:27;"There's that kind of stuff."
14:29;14:37;"You're still thinking a president from decades ago. I mean, I sort of, you know, because you're not supposed to be, it's not like the Decemberists or something. You're
not in the period of the time."
14:37;14:46;"Maybe we're in the sixties. We are the Beatles, except we're into jamming. And Lindbergh was a 10-term president who beat FDR."
14:46;14:52;"These are just weird ones. We're not trying to ruffle any feathers. This is just for history bucks."
14:52;14:54;"You don't make the rules."
14:54;14:56;"Okay. How about, what's a more of a kind vibe one?"
14:56;14:58;"How about this? Kennedy doesn't get killed."
14:58;15:09;"Okay. Yeah, we do Bob Dylan covers if Kennedy wasn't killed. And we jam at Bob Dylan. How about one? We're the Strokes, but 9/11 didn't happen."
15:09;15:10;"Ooh."
15:10;15:13;"And we jam."
15:13;15:14;"Wow, you sound exactly the same."
15:14;15:21;"But we jam a little bit. We jam a little more."
15:21;15:24;"Maybe not as popular, but sound exactly the same."
15:25;15:30;"It's just something for the history buffs and the music fans. You know, there's significant crossover."

16:54;16:57;"- Well, speaking of history buffs and music fans,"
16:58;17:00;"there's a new Rolling Stones album out, guys."
17:00;17:03;"I've heard a bunch of it."
17:03;17:04;"It's solid."
17:04;17:06;"I listened to it today,"
17:06;17:09;"running errands and I went for a run and I listened to it."
17:09;17:12;"And how many stars out of five, Jake?"
17:12;17:15;"Two and a half."
17:15;17:18;"Okay, right down the middle."
17:18;17:19;"Right down the middle."
17:19;17:21;"- Is that a good review for you, Jake?"
17:21;17:23;"- Well, maybe I'll give it three."
17:23;17:26;"Will you be listening again outside of time crisis?"
17:26;17:27;"No."
17:27;17:28;"- Okay."
17:28;17:29;"- I will not."
17:29;17:31;"- Was it an interesting listen?"
17:31;17:32;"Absolutely."
17:32;17:33;"- Well, let's get into it."
17:33;17:34;"This is major."
17:34;17:36;"New Rolling Stones album."
17:36;17:41;"The first album of original material in seven,"
17:41;17:43;"wait, 18 years."
17:43;17:46;"The first since Charlie Watts died in 2021."
17:46;17:50;"Got special guests like Paul McCartney."
17:50;17:51;"- He's on there?"
17:51;17:53;"- Yeah, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder."
17:53;17:57;"- I did not hear Paul or Stevie singing."
17:57;17:58;"Maybe they were just, you know."
17:58;18:00;"- Maybe Paul's just playing bass."
18:00;18:01;"- Yeah."
18:01;18:02;"- Well, first let's talk the title."
18:02;18:05;"Do you guys know what Hackney Diamonds are?"
18:05;18:06;"- No."
18:06;18:06;"- I happened to learn it"
18:06;18:08;"'cause I was talking about this album the past week."
18:08;18:11;"So I learned it from friend of the show, Chris Bayo."
18:11;18:12;"- Okay."
18:12;18:16;"- So Hackney is known as a kind of rough and tumble"
18:16;18:18;"neighborhood of London."
18:18;18:21;"Although it's also been significantly gentrified"
18:21;18:24;"in the 21st century."
18:24;18:28;"But Hackney Diamonds refers to broken up little pieces"
18:28;18:32;"of glass on the ground 'cause somebody smashed in a window"
18:32;18:35;"for like a robbery or who knows why."
18:35;18:39;"So it's a kind of a, it's like a funny phrase, you know,"
18:39;18:41;"talking about the glass on the ground"
18:41;18:44;"in a rough and tumble neighborhood, Hackney Diamonds."
18:44;18:46;"- Now, were the stones from Hackney?"
18:46;18:47;"- I don't think so."
18:47;18:48;"- Huh."
18:48;18:51;"So they're just name checking a neighborhood in London"
18:51;18:54;"that has nothing to do with their own history."
18:54;18:56;"I just assumed they were from Hackney."
18:56;18:59;"- No, I think, make us from Dartford."
18:59;19:01;"- What you're saying is that it's an expression"
19:01;19:03;"that extends beyond the neighborhood."
19:03;19:05;"- That's a good question."
19:05;19:08;"- It has broad application in British society,"
19:08;19:10;"Hackney Diamonds."
19:10;19:11;"- Now that I don't know about."
19:11;19:12;"- Yeah."
19:12;19:15;"- Yeah, like are you in, you're in like South London"
19:15;19:17;"in Brixton and someone smashes in a window"
19:17;19:20;"and he's a, ""Check it out, Hackney Diamonds."""
19:20;19:22;"- I kind of doubt that."
19:22;19:24;"It might also be one of those phrases"
19:24;19:27;"that nobody particularly uses."
19:27;19:29;"It just sounds good when you hear about it."
19:29;19:31;"Like, you know, like one of those phrases"
19:31;19:33;"that people talk about more than actually use."
19:33;19:35;"- What's another example of that?"
19:35;19:37;"- Well, I always think of this one"
19:37;19:39;"that somebody said to me very confidently"
19:39;19:41;"and I never heard it again."
19:41;19:42;"It was a guy."
19:42;19:45;"I mean, this guy always cracked me up."
19:45;19:46;"He was a funny guy, but he was,"
19:46;19:47;"he didn't seem to be joking."
19:47;19:50;"He was like, ""Oh, I had the craziest fight"
19:50;19:52;"with my girlfriend."""
19:52;19:53;"I was like, ""Oh yeah, what happened?"""
19:53;19:57;"He's like, ""She got so mad at me or something."
19:57;19:58;"I said she kicked me out."
19:58;19:59;"I was down on the sidewalk."
19:59;20:02;"She was throwing my clothes."
20:02;20:03;"She was throwing my clothes out the window,"
20:03;20:06;"yelling at me, you know, a Brooklyn breakup."""
20:06;20:07;"And I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
20:07;20:08;"He's like, ""You know, that's what a Brooklyn,"
20:08;20:10;"you ever heard the phrase of Brooklyn breakup?"""
20:10;20:12;"And I was like, ""No."""
20:12;20:14;"And he was like, ""Yeah, you know, Brooklyn breakup."
20:14;20:15;"Someone's yelling out the window,"
20:15;20:16;"throw the clothes out the window."
20:16;20:18;"That's called a Brooklyn breakup."""
20:18;20:19;"And I can't, I don't even remember"
20:19;20:21;"if this dude lived in Brooklyn, but he said that."
20:21;20:23;"And then I feel like I was like, ""Oh, that's hilarious."""
20:23;20:26;"I mean, not the misfortune of this couple fighting,"
20:26;20:28;"but the phrase."
20:28;20:30;"And then I just never heard it again"
20:30;20:31;"for the rest of my life."
20:31;20:33;"And I was just like, ""You just gotta make that up,"
20:33;20:34;"a Brooklyn breakup."""
20:34;20:37;"But I'm just saying, that's the type of thing that,"
20:37;20:39;"you know, like Vampire Weekend call an album,"
20:39;20:41;"never would, but called Brooklyn breakup."
20:41;20:43;"And then, you know, do some press and be like,"
20:43;20:44;"""What do you, so what's a Brooklyn breakup?"""
20:44;20:46;"It's like, you know, it's a phrase that refers"
20:46;20:48;"to this kind of very emotional,"
20:48;20:51;"yelling out the window kind of breakup, you know?"
20:51;20:52;"And be like, ""Well, how would you even use that"
20:52;20:53;"in a sentence?"""
20:53;20:53;"You wouldn't."
20:53;20:55;"It's just like a thing people say."
20:55;20:59;"- Yeah, there's nothing on Google about Brooklyn breakups."
20:59;21:01;"Zero."
21:01;21:02;"I think this guy just made it up."
21:02;21:04;"I think he saw too many Spike Lee movies"
21:04;21:06;"and he's sort of like, ""Yeah, it's a Brooklyn breakup."""
21:06;21:07;"- You know, yelling out the window."
21:07;21:10;"It's also funny like that Brooklyn's changed so much."
21:10;21:11;"- Right."
21:11;21:12;"Yeah, a Brooklyn breakup now,"
21:12;21:14;"like we changed the locks on the doors"
21:14;21:15;"and I called my lawyer."
21:15;21:19;"- Yeah, I sent a Snapchat to let him know."
21:19;21:22;"- Chloe Grace Moratz and Brooklyn Beckham breakup?"
21:22;21:25;"- Yeah, exactly."
21:25;21:26;"That's what a Brooklyn breakup is now."
21:26;21:28;"Well, so what does it say for Hackney Diamonds"
21:28;21:29;"when you look up definition?"
21:29;21:31;"- Wait, okay, hold on."
21:31;21:35;"Guys, so I'm reading about this"
21:35;21:38;"'cause there's no, you can't find any expression on it."
21:38;21:41;"The news is only about the album title."
21:41;21:45;"And it said, ""Richard stated that it refers to"
21:45;21:47;"""broken, oh, leftover from,"
21:47;21:49;"""leftover in the morning after a quote,"
21:49;21:51;"""good Saturday night that went bad."""
21:51;21:53;"I really actually don't know what that means,"
21:53;21:55;"a good Saturday night that went bad."
21:55;21:57;"- Everybody's having a good time,"
21:57;22:00;"fun Saturday night, guy said to his buddies,"
22:00;22:02;"""Hey, if you guys help me move"
22:02;22:06;"""these 10 heavy delicate sheets of glass"
22:06;22:08;"""from my apartment to the warehouse,"
22:08;22:11;"""I'll provide the beer."""
22:11;22:12;"All right, let's do this."
22:12;22:14;"Everybody's having a good time."
22:14;22:17;"Then get a little too drunk."
22:17;22:19;"Next thing you know, shattered glass everywhere."
22:19;22:21;"Another Saturday night ruined."
22:21;22:24;"- I do wanna point out, like your friend, Ezra,"
22:24;22:27;"Richard stated it refers to broken glass."
22:27;22:29;"There's no corroboration."
22:29;22:31;"- Oh, that's a good, I'd have to ask Baio,"
22:31;22:34;"did you hear this from like when you were in London?"
22:34;22:35;"- When he was reading the Wikipedia."
22:35;22:37;"- 'Cause I could see it's equally plausible."
22:37;22:39;"Maybe he also was just like researching the album"
22:39;22:41;"and say, ""Oh, you know what I read?"""
22:41;22:44;"I actually don't know, I'll have to ask him."
22:44;22:45;"So maybe it is like Brooklyn breakup."
22:45;22:47;"You know, another one that comes to mind"
22:47;22:49;"is like Sicilian necktie."
22:49;22:51;"You know when people speak very confidently"
22:51;22:55;"about like these kind of like mobster, gangster type ways"
22:55;22:57;"of like hurting somebody?"
22:57;22:58;"Oh, Sicilian necktie, and you're like,"
22:58;23:00;"""I don't know if like actual,"
23:00;23:02;"""like some old school mafia guy"
23:02;23:03;"""talks about a Sicilian necktie,"
23:03;23:06;"""or that's just something that like writers"
23:06;23:10;"""and like, you know, people like us jawbone about."""
23:10;23:11;"You know what I mean?"
23:11;23:14;"- Like if you were actually a Sicilian gangster,"
23:14;23:17;"would you use the expression Sicilian necktie?"
23:17;23:18;"- Yeah, it sounds like something like--"
23:18;23:18;"- Probably not."
23:18;23:21;"- Like a New York Post journalist in the 50s wrote,"
23:21;23:24;"you know, made up just to give a little more color"
23:24;23:26;"for their like mafia reporting."
23:26;23:28;"- I just asked ChatGPT about it,"
23:28;23:30;"and they say, ""This term is not related"
23:30;23:33;"""to any actual practices or customs in Sicily"
23:33;23:36;"""or any other region, but as a creation"
23:36;23:39;"""of the dark world of crime fiction."""
23:39;23:41;"- Right, fiction, yeah."
23:41;23:42;"- What about Hackney Diamonds?"
23:42;23:44;"- I found a Mick Jagger quote."
23:44;23:45;"Yeah, okay, great."
23:45;23:48;"Jimmy Fallon asks Mick Jagger"
23:48;23:50;"if Hackney Diamonds was a type of slang,"
23:50;23:52;"to which Mick Jagger replied,"
23:52;23:54;"""Yeah, it's like when you get your windscreen broken"
23:54;23:56;"""on a Saturday night in Hackney,"
23:56;23:58;"""and all the bits go on the street."
23:58;24:01;"""That's Hackney Diamonds."""
24:01;24:05;"- So someone broke your windshield"
24:05;24:07;"on a Saturday night in Hackney?"
24:07;24:08;"All right."
24:08;24:10;"- The alternate titles for this album"
24:10;24:13;"were Hit and Run and Smash and Grab."
24:13;24:15;"- Well, they chose right."
24:15;24:18;"Smash and Grab, those are terrible titles."
24:18;24:20;"- Both of those align."
24:20;24:22;"Hit and Run a little bit, that's darker, I guess."
24:22;24:24;"- What if they called it Come and Go?"
24:24;24:28;"Like that Midwestern gas station"
24:28;24:30;"or like convenience store chain?"
24:30;24:31;"Everybody knows that one, right?"
24:31;24:34;"It's K-U-M and Go."
24:34;24:37;"It's infamous, Come and Go."
24:37;24:38;"If the Rolling Stones' new album"
24:38;24:40;"was called Come and Go with a K,"
24:40;24:43;"that would just be like, drop the mic,"
24:43;24:47;"best album since Some Girls, 10 out of 10,"
24:47;24:50;"like bow down."
24:50;24:52;"- From when they were touring the Midwest."
24:52;24:54;"- And Mick Jagger, I've talked about this,"
24:54;24:56;"how I was obsessed with the fact"
24:56;24:58;"that I wasn't at the show,"
24:58;25:01;"but I read about how when they played MetLife,"
25:01;25:04;"which will always be giant stadium to me in New Jersey,"
25:04;25:08;"that he apparently went to the TikTok diner,"
25:08;25:11;"which is like a famous diner on the highway."
25:11;25:13;"Everybody in New Jersey has been there."
25:13;25:15;"And then on stage, he like talked about it"
25:15;25:17;"'cause he's the ultimate showman."
25:17;25:18;"He goes out of his way to bring a little bit"
25:18;25:20;"of local flavor and he just went,"
25:20;25:23;"and he was like, I've never heard the audio."
25:23;25:26;"I always picture it in him doing his kind of like"
25:26;25:28;"fake Southern accent."
25:28;25:29;"- Yeah."
25:29;25:29;"- And just going on like,"
25:29;25:34;"now New Jersey, you know today I had to go"
25:34;25:36;"to the TikTok diner."
25:36;25:38;"And probably was like, whoa."
25:38;25:43;"And he says, and I had myself some Taylor ham."
25:43;25:46;"And Taylor ham, have we talked about this on the show before?"
25:46;25:50;"There's like this processed meat product"
25:50;25:52;"in New Jersey called Taylor ham."
25:52;25:53;"And half the state calls it Taylor ham"
25:53;25:56;"and the other half calls it pork roll."
25:56;25:57;"There's versions of it everywhere."
25:57;25:59;"It's like what you would have on a,"
25:59;26:02;"you get like an egg and cheese and Taylor ham sandwich."
26:02;26:04;"But anyway, Mick Jagger, he like knew,"
26:04;26:07;"he shouted out a very specific beloved diner"
26:07;26:09;"and he shouted out Taylor ham."
26:09;26:12;"I just pictured in that voice from ""Faraway Eyes."""
26:12;26:13;"- Oh yeah."
26:13;26:14;"- I was listening to the country music station."
26:14;26:18;"I must've ran about 50 red lights"
26:18;26:21;"when I had that Taylor ham at the TikTok diner."
26:21;26:24;"- The Lord's always on your side."
26:24;26:25;"- Always on your side."
26:25;26:27;"But can you just picture Mick Jagger,"
26:27;26:29;"where do they have come and go?"
26:29;26:30;"Like Ohio?"
26:30;26:33;"- Yeah, I've seen it in the Midwest, like Nebraska."
26:33;26:34;"- Yeah, Nebraska."
26:34;26:37;"- Didn't see any come and go's on my recent Ohio trip."
26:37;26:41;"- The last time I was here in Omaha, Nebraska,"
26:41;26:45;"in 1998, playing this beautiful stadium,"
26:45;26:47;"I got a bit parched and I found myself"
26:47;26:51;"at an establishment called Come and Go."
26:51;26:55;"I walked in with Charlie, Bill and Keith,"
26:55;26:57;"just looking for something to quench my thirst."
26:57;27:03;"But when I saw that fine looking woman in the corner,"
27:03;27:07;"I knew I would not be coming and going too quickly."
27:07;27:09;"It'd be so sad."
27:09;27:11;"Rolling Stones, Come and Go."
27:11;27:12;"The band from the Midwest."
27:12;27:16;"- And I got a 64 ounce Dr. Pepper."
27:16;27:17;"- So there's 395-"
27:17;27:19;"- And I drank the whole thing."
27:19;27:21;"- There's 395 locations."
27:21;27:22;"- Whoa."
27:22;27:25;"- And three states are 101 in Iowa."
27:25;27:28;"That's 26% of all come and go's."
27:28;27:31;"Colorado and Missouri."
27:31;27:32;"- Only three states."
27:32;27:33;"So I guess I've seen them in-"
27:33;27:34;"- No, no, no, that's not enough."
27:34;27:37;"There's more, they're in 13 states."
27:37;27:41;"Those are the three that have 101, 83 and 58."
27:41;27:42;"- Okay, so Iowa's number one."
27:42;27:46;"- Nebraska has 20."
27:46;27:50;"- When I found myself in the Buckeye State of Iowa,"
27:50;27:53;"you make a dead man come and go."
27:53;27:56;"Come and go with a K."
27:56;27:58;"I don't even want to talk about Hackney Diamonds anymore."
27:58;28:01;"I'm so excited just thinking about-"
28:01;28:02;"- This new one."
28:02;28:04;"- The next Rolling Stones album,"
28:04;28:09;"produced by the TC crew, called Come and Go."
28:09;28:12;"Mick is doing a lot of that far away eyes,"
28:12;28:15;"Southern talking, which is such an all time classic."
28:15;28:16;"I love that song."
28:16;28:18;"Let's put that on for any listeners"
28:18;28:20;"who don't know this song."
28:20;28:22;"And this is why the Stones are just,"
28:22;28:25;"roll so hard, is that some girls,"
28:25;28:27;"which is like their cool, urbane New York album,"
28:27;28:30;"it's got the disco song, Miss You."
28:30;28:32;"It's got the kind of punky songs."
28:32;28:33;"And then just out of nowhere,"
28:33;28:35;"they got this like, just country song."
28:35;28:37;"- I know."

33:58;34:01;"- He's staying at the finest, the Four Seasons,"
34:01;34:05;"Oklahoma City, and then getting on a PJ."
34:05;34:07;"Yeah, I can see."
34:07;34:08;"I also love the idea of the Stones,"
34:08;34:10;"like this is our Midwest album."
34:10;34:12;"You know, they love, you know, chess records,"
34:12;34:14;"Chicago blues."
34:14;34:17;"So they can have a lot of like Chicago electric blues"
34:17;34:19;"type stuff, but then they also get to some"
34:19;34:20;"of the surrounding states."
34:20;34:23;"Yeah, come and go."
34:23;34:26;"Wait, what number Stones album is Hackney Diamonds?"
34:26;34:28;"- 26."
34:28;34:31;"- Okay, so we've talked enough about their 27th album,"
34:31;34:32;"Come and Go."
34:32;34:36;"Let's talk about their last album, Hackney Diamonds."
34:36;34:39;"Jake, do you have a favorite song from listening?"
34:39;34:42;"- I mean, I would say the theme of the album,"
34:42;34:46;"that I picked up on is basically like an old guy"
34:46;34:49;"just being like, please just leave me alone."
34:49;34:54;"Like, don't like, you're really on my ass."
34:54;34:56;"Please just like, really classic old guy."
34:56;35:01;"Just like, I just want to be by myself."
35:01;35:04;"And like, you're just like all up in my business."
35:04;35:06;"Please back off."
35:06;35:08;"'Cause there's, first song is Angry."
35:08;35:09;"Don't be angry with me."
35:11;35:14;"Another song called Bite My Head Off,"
35:14;35:17;"which I guess Paul McCartney plays bass"
35:17;35:18;"on Bite My Head Off."
35:18;35:20;"And that's pretty much just like,"
35:20;35:21;"don't bite my head off here."
35:21;35:25;"Just, then there's another song called Driving Me Too Hard."
35:25;35:26;"- Okay."
35:26;35:27;"- Which is just like, God, you're really on me here."
35:27;35:29;"You're driving me too hard."
35:29;35:32;"Another song called Live By The Sword."
35:32;35:36;"I mean, he's, Mick and Keith are just like annoyed"
35:36;35:37;"with their wives."
35:37;35:40;"That's the theme of this album, I think."
35:40;35:41;"- Like, lay off."
35:41;35:42;"- Yeah."
35:42;35:43;"- Hold on."
35:43;35:47;"I did like, I'm trying to remember which song I liked."
35:47;35:50;"- I listened to the first few."
35:50;35:52;"- Whole Wide World, maybe?"
35:52;35:53;"- I don't remember."
35:53;35:55;"- Let's listen to like, I feel like I heard like,"
35:55;35:56;"track two or three and I was like, okay,"
35:56;35:58;"this kind of sounds like, I was getting some"
35:58;36:01;"Black Crowes energy, kind of like '90s vibes."
36:01;36:02;"- Yeah."
36:02;36:04;"I had this weird Uncanny Valley experience"
36:04;36:07;"where they sounded like rewrites."
36:07;36:08;"(guitar music)"
36:08;36:10;"- Oh yeah, this has Black Crowes energy."
36:11;36:14;"(guitar music)"
36:14;36:19;"♪ Your fingerprints in the dark ♪"
36:19;36:24;"♪ Your past and present tangled up in my arms ♪"
36:24;36:26;"- It's possible Mick Jagger would like,"
36:26;36:28;"be so pissed, be like,"
36:28;36:30;"you're singing a Rolling Stones song,"
36:30;36:31;"sounds like the Black Crowes?"
36:31;36:32;"Go to hell."
36:32;36:35;"Are you (beep) kidding me?"
36:35;36:37;"They sound like us."
36:37;36:39;"- Right, I mean, I did have that experience"
36:39;36:41;"a couple of times where I was like,"
36:41;36:43;"well, this reminds me of bands"
36:43;36:45;"that the Stones clearly influenced."
36:45;36:46;"Like there were a couple of moments-"
36:46;36:48;"- It's hard to avoid when you've been around so long."
36:48;36:50;"- Yeah, that it's gonna go full circle."
36:50;36:53;"There were a few moments that kind of reminded me"
36:53;36:55;"of like, Def Leppard."
36:55;36:57;"More on the production"
36:57;37:01;"and some of the like, arrangement choices."
37:01;37:03;"They were very fleeting moments, but like,"
37:03;37:04;"I was like, I'm sure Def Leppard"
37:04;37:06;"was influenced by the Stones."

40:17;40:18;"- Yeah."
40:18;40:23;"- So is there anybody that becomes a new Rolling Stones fan"
40:25;40:26;"at Hackney Diamonds?"
40:26;40:29;"I mean, who are they making music?"
40:29;40:32;"Is it just out of an impulse, like a true creative impulse?"
40:32;40:36;"Is there, are they trying to still speak to a fan base?"
40:36;40:38;"Are they hoping someone else is like,"
40:38;40:41;"someone's kid is like, ooh, trying to bite my head off?"
40:41;40:49;"- I think, I think obviously the Stones are like true artists"
40:49;40:53;"and they haven't made an album in almost 20 years."
40:53;40:58;"So I think, I bet there was a sense of like inspiration"
40:58;41:02;"or like Nick or whoever the lads were,"
41:02;41:05;"were excited to get back in work."
41:05;41:08;"So I definitely don't think it's on some like,"
41:08;41:10;"I think the spirit moved them."
41:10;41:13;"- No, and I wasn't suggesting it was,"
41:13;41:13;"they don't need the money."
41:13;41:15;"It wasn't really that, I'm just trying to understand,"
41:15;41:17;"is there anyone who listens, you know,"
41:17;41:19;"and is like, oh, this is my favorite,"
41:19;41:20;"not even favorite album."
41:20;41:25;"- I could see, I could see like a kid who's hearing it"
41:25;41:28;"through like the context of their parents"
41:28;41:32;"or grandparents maybe, and who like,"
41:32;41:33;"hears the 60s and 70s stuff"
41:33;41:36;"and it sounds really like old to them."
41:36;41:40;"And then this has the sort of like more contemporary sheen"
41:40;41:42;"and Mick has the weird kind of like,"
41:42;41:44;"I don't know if it's like the auto tune"
41:44;41:46;"or some sort of weird kind of filter"
41:46;41:48;"in his voice the whole album."
41:48;41:50;"And I could see like a kid, like a 12 year old"
41:50;41:52;"just being like, this is way cooler."
41:52;41:57;"This is like, this sounds much more like new and fresh to me"
41:57;41:59;"and like, if you played that kid like Brown Sugar"
41:59;42:00;"or something, they'd just be like,"
42:00;42:05;"this sounds like a thousand years old."
42:05;42:07;"Just like some like young American psycho kid"
42:07;42:09;"is just like, I found the Stones work"
42:09;42:12;"from the 60s to the 90s to be somewhat lacking."
42:12;42:15;"The recording technology just wasn't at the level yet"
42:15;42:16;"to capture the guys."
42:16;42:20;"And the vocal sounded way too human."
42:20;42:22;"- Around Hackney Diamonds is the time"
42:22;42:24;"I really started to get turned on"
42:24;42:25;"by their rock and roll sound."
42:25;42:29;"- Yeah, I think there's probably is that kid."
42:29;42:34;"- Just like a weird 13 year old talking to his math teacher."
42:34;42:37;"Teacher's like, you never checked out Exile on Main Street?"
42:37;42:40;"He's like, believe me, I've tried."
42:40;42:42;"I know the Rolling Stones are often referred to"
42:42;42:44;"as one of the greatest rock bands of all time,"
42:44;42:46;"but it was only on Hackney Diamonds"
42:46;42:48;"that I really started to get a taste"
42:48;42:50;"for what they were trying to accomplish."
42:50;42:55;"- Frankly, the dull analog sound of the recordings"
42:55;42:59;"from the 60s, 70s and 80s really turned me on."
42:59;43:01;"Then the 90s, it really turned me off."
43:01;43:04;"In the 90s, things started to turn around."
43:04;43:08;"- It only took 50 years for them to come into their own."
43:08;43:11;"- Yeah, I could picture one kid in the country"
43:11;43:12;"who felt that way."
43:12;43:14;"But I think also there's a,"
43:14;43:18;"I think with any band at a certain point,"
43:18;43:20;"you gotta be like, you do what you want."
43:20;43:24;"And best case scenario, your new album,"
43:24;43:27;"whether or not it wins over any young people,"
43:27;43:28;"and in the Stones' case,"
43:28;43:32;"it's definitely got people talking about the Rolling Stones."
43:32;43:36;"It might not be that easy to imagine the American Psycho Kid"
43:36;43:40;"who's like, album 26 is when I finally got"
43:40;43:42;"what everybody else was talking about."
43:42;43:45;"But you can definitely picture a kid who's like,"
43:45;43:49;"dad or grandpa, grandma is bumping Hackney Diamonds"
43:49;43:51;"in the car and he's like, what's up with this?"
43:51;43:52;"He's like, it's the Rolling Stones, man."
43:52;43:55;"And then suddenly he starts to put it together."
43:55;43:57;"Like maybe he's just at the age where he's like,"
43:57;43:58;"have you ever heard this song?"
43:58;44:01;"And he plays like, ""Paint It Black"""
44:01;44:03;"and kid's like, oh yeah, I have heard that song."
44:03;44:04;"That's the same band?"
44:04;44:06;"And he's like, yeah."
44:06;44:08;"And he's like, you know, ""Start Me Up?"""
44:08;44:08;"And he's like, yeah."
44:08;44:09;"He's like, that's from the early 80s."
44:09;44:13;"And maybe the kid's like, oh, I don't know."
44:13;44:15;"And I could see like, then you start digging in."
44:15;44:16;"- You know what, that sort of reminds me."
44:16;44:19;"Have you ever talked to somebody who's like,"
44:19;44:21;"do you ever watch X Show or whatever?"
44:21;44:23;"And they're like, yeah, I started it."
44:23;44:24;"And they're like, no, no, you gotta get through"
44:24;44:27;"like season two or three and it really gets going."
44:27;44:29;"And you're like, oh, and you're like,"
44:29;44:32;"I just can't even imagine at the time"
44:32;44:36;"this American Psycho Kid being like, it took 22 albums."
44:36;44:41;"But finally, the Stones sort of have found the rhythm."
44:41;44:45;"Funnily enough, I had already made the decision"
44:45;44:48;"about a year ago that October 23,"
44:48;44:51;"I was gonna listen to one Rolling Stones album a day"
44:51;44:54;"throughout the month, starting with,"
44:54;44:55;"wait, is their first album called"
44:55;44:56;"England's Newest Hitmakers?"
44:56;44:57;"- I don't know."
44:57;44:59;"- There's like an early, one of their early US albums"
44:59;45:01;"was called England's Newest Hitmakers."
45:01;45:02;"- That's awesome."
45:02;45:06;"- He's like, I found the early garage rock blues stuff"
45:06;45:07;"hopelessly amateur."
45:09;45:13;"And only on October 26, when I popped in Hackney Diamonds,"
45:13;45:17;"did I finally realize these guys may have something."
45:17;45:21;"You know, what's also funny is that I think"
45:21;45:26;"because of Guitar Hero, which is already a long time ago,"
45:26;45:28;"but Guitar Hero for, you know,"
45:28;45:31;"let's say a couple generations, millennials,"
45:31;45:34;"maybe some older Zoomers, made Paint It Black"
45:34;45:36;"the best known Stones song."
45:36;45:39;"There's definitely kids who know Paint It Black,"
45:39;45:42;"but don't know Start Me Up, don't know Brown Sugar."
45:42;45:43;"And Paint It Black is like, you know,"
45:43;45:46;"a pretty unique Stones song with kind of the Indian"
45:46;45:49;"influence, not bluesy at all."
45:49;45:51;"That would have been an interesting, weird move"
45:51;45:54;"if on album 26, they just made like all Paint It Black vibes."
45:54;45:56;"They're like, hey, it seems like the young people"
45:56;46:00;"like Paint It Black, so this album, a lot of sitar,"
46:00;46:03;"a lot of our kind of like slightly gothy worldview."
46:03;46:05;"'Cause that is an aspect of the Rolling Stones"
46:05;46:06;"that people like forget about."
46:06;46:10;"You got your Paint It Black, Sympathy for the Devil."
46:10;46:14;"There's that like slightly satanic, spooky,"
46:14;46:18;"you know, gothic side of the Stones,"
46:18;46:20;"which we haven't heard in a really long time."
46:20;46:21;"- Yeah, when did that end?"
46:21;46:25;"- Well, and also I hope Mick lives for another 30 years,"
46:25;46:27;"'cause we love him."
46:27;46:31;"But whenever he feels the Grim Reaper pulling on him"
46:31;46:34;"and he's ready to drop his David Bowie Blackstar,"
46:35;46:37;"I think that'll be a sick album."
46:37;46:38;"Because the Stones do have it."
46:38;46:40;"That is, they do have what it takes"
46:40;46:42;"to make their Blackstar."
46:42;46:44;"- Yeah, I don't know if they would,"
46:44;46:46;"I think they have it, but I don't think they would do it."
46:46;46:48;"'Cause they're too much of like, you know,"
46:48;46:49;"showbiz guys, like you were saying."
46:49;46:51;"- Like Mick knows he's about to die,"
46:51;46:53;"and he just drops like, just like the horniest"
46:53;46:55;"party album of all time."
46:55;46:56;"(laughing)"
46:56;46:57;"That would be sick too."
46:57;46:59;"- He's like, we gotta get Mark Ronson in here."
46:59;47:00;"We gotta."
47:00;47:04;"- Stones version of Uptown Funk."
47:04;47:06;"- Maybe that is come and go."
47:06;47:08;"Wait, actually that'd be sick."
47:08;47:10;"Come and Go is the final Stones album."
47:10;47:12;"It's like the Wrestling with Mortality album."
47:12;47:14;"But basically it's like, so Mick,"
47:14;47:16;"if you had to look back on life,"
47:16;47:18;"did you understand something about like"
47:18;47:22;"the haunting nature of reality or what, you know,"
47:22;47:23;"what it's all about?"
47:23;47:27;"And he's just like, life is just one big come and go."
47:27;47:30;"If I had to describe this crazy trip,"
47:30;47:32;"it's just a come and go."
47:32;47:37;"I came and I went, I come and I go, that's all."
47:37;47:39;"And I had a good time doing it."
47:39;47:42;"- I mean, there is this idea that at the end it's like,"
47:42;47:44;"yeah, his last record, the one that's really supposed"
47:44;47:49;"to be reflective and meditative is featuring Bruno Mars,"
47:49;47:51;"featuring A$AP Rocky."
47:51;47:54;"- Featuring BlackPink, BTS."
47:54;47:57;"The first, just like all this stuff that seems like"
47:57;48:01;"so kind of like cravenly about expanding the brand."
48:01;48:05;"And it's just like featuring the first Rolling Stone song"
48:05;48:06;"in Korean."
48:06;48:11;"Just like, you could totally see some other band doing it"
48:11;48:14;"because they've got another 30 years left"
48:14;48:15;"and they want to break into a new market."
48:15;48:17;"And you're like, the Stones, it's like,"
48:17;48:19;"let's see if we can break Korea."
48:19;48:26;"- We have J Balvin and BlackPink, it's in Spanish, Korean."
48:26;48:28;"- Wait, wait, wait."
48:28;48:32;"How about like a stripped down Oliver Anthony collab,"
48:32;48:34;"but like it's produced by Timbaland."
48:34;48:38;"- Remix, with some beats."
48:38;48:43;"- Also, Matt, just so people know what we're talking about"
48:43;48:46;"in comparing, you know, ""Black Star"" by Bowie."
48:46;48:49;"People often refer to that as one of maybe"
48:49;48:52;"the all-time great goodbye albums from an iconic artist"
48:52;48:54;"because he knew he was sick."
48:54;48:55;"So can you play it?"
48:55;48:56;"Well, is the song called ""Black Star"""
48:56;48:59;"that kind of like weird Middle Eastern jazz song"
48:59;49:00;"where he's doing like,"
49:00;49:04;"♪ In the vill of, there is a solitary candle ♪"
49:04;49:05;"I haven't heard that song in a long time."
49:05;49:06;"I actually want to hear that."
49:06;49:08;"I was thinking about that album recently."
49:08;49:10;"- While Matt pulls that up,"
49:10;49:12;"I just like this idea of like the Oliver Anthony"
49:12;49:14;"or like something really subtle comes in like this"
49:14;49:17;"and it just says, ""Mike Will made it."""
49:17;49:19;"And then it just like, then the beat drops."
49:19;49:23;"So you really, you were thinking, oh, Mick did it."
49:23;49:24;"- Mick Jagger made it."
49:24;49:27;"(laughing)"
49:27;49:30;"♪ In the vill of Omen ♪"
49:30;49:34;"♪ In the vill of Omen ♪"

49:41;49:46;"♪ In the center of it all ♪"
49:46;49:49;"- Yeah, I don't see Mick and Keith going this direction."
49:49;49:52;"Although I could hear Mick's voice on this."
49:52;49:54;"Different lyrics."
49:55;50:00;"♪ On the day of execution ♪"
50:00;50:02;"♪ On the day of execution ♪"

50:34;50:41;"- All right, you get the idea."
50:41;50:43;"David Bowie's ""Black Star."""
50:43;50:46;"How old was David Bowie when he died?"
50:46;50:48;"- I'm gonna guess like around 70."
50:48;50:51;"- Ezra, what's your guess?"
50:51;50:52;"- You know, I'm just not sure."
50:52;50:55;"- Maybe in his 60s?"
50:55;50:57;"- Maybe in his 60s."
50:57;51:01;"- My man, David Bowie, 69 years old when he died."
51:01;51:02;"- 69 years."
51:02;51:05;"Quite the legend."
51:05;51:07;"But yeah, I only ask that because I'm thinking about,"
51:07;51:09;"you know, Mick Jagger being 80 now,"
51:09;51:11;"just like a full decade past that."
51:11;51:14;"Dropping Hackney Diamonds."
51:14;51:15;"- Apparently they have another album"
51:15;51:17;"that's like three quarters done."
51:17;51:18;"- Okay."
51:18;51:20;"- I would love it if they just start dropping an album"
51:20;51:22;"a year like it's the 1960s again."
51:22;51:25;"- Yeah, it's fun that the Stones have a new album out."
51:25;51:29;"We should talk about the special MLB promo they did"
51:29;51:33;"where they teamed up with Major League Baseball"
51:33;51:36;"and they released a vinyl edition of the album"
51:36;51:40;"to go with every single MLB team."
51:40;51:41;"- Very confusing."
51:41;51:44;"- It's a bit confusing, but you could get,"
51:44;51:46;"if you're a Yankees fan,"
51:46;51:49;"you get your Yankees edition Hackney Diamonds"
51:49;51:54;"and the Rolling Stones lips and tongue logo"
51:54;51:58;"is made out of the Yankees logo or like Yankees colors."
51:58;52:00;"Or if you're like a St. Louis Cardinals fan,"
52:00;52:02;"you get the St. Louis Cardinals edition."
52:02;52:07;"- Noted baseball enthusiasts, the Rolling Stones."
52:07;52:11;"- Yeah, baseball is like a slightly funny fit."
52:11;52:13;"I mean, Mick is famously a cricket fan."
52:13;52:16;"He turns up at the big cricket events in the UK."
52:16;52:18;"- Yeah, I don't, what's the backstory"
52:18;52:22;"on like the, I mean, it's so confusing."
52:22;52:26;"Like how many of those like Kansas City Royals"
52:26;52:29;"copies of Hackney Diamonds are they moving?"
52:29;52:31;"- Yeah."
52:31;52:32;"- Is it one of those things that's like,"
52:32;52:33;"it doesn't actually exist."
52:33;52:36;"It's like, it's made to order kind of thing."
52:36;52:37;"- I wonder."
52:37;52:40;"- Like so much crap that we stumble across on this show."
52:40;52:41;"- Like, yeah."
52:41;52:44;"- Wait, what's the least popular baseball team in America?"
52:44;52:46;"I'm gonna let Matt weigh in on that."
52:46;52:48;"- My guess would be the Oakland A's."
52:48;52:49;"- The least popular?"
52:49;52:50;"- Big market though."
52:50;52:51;"- They're gonna move the team."
52:51;52:53;"So that's my guess."
52:53;52:54;"- Where's it going?"
52:54;52:55;"- So they're like, they're sitting ducks."
52:55;52:56;"- Where are they moving?"
52:56;52:56;"- Vegas."
52:56;52:57;"- The Vegas A's?"
52:57;52:58;"- The Vegas Athletics?"
52:58;52:59;"- Yeah."
52:59;53:00;"- Are they building an indoor stadium?"
53:00;53:01;"- Probably."
53:01;53:03;"- I mean, they have to, right?"
53:03;53:05;"- They absolutely have to."
53:05;53:06;"- The Sphere."
53:06;53:07;"They should use the Sphere."
53:07;53:09;"- Oh yeah, they're gonna have games in the Sphere."
53:09;53:10;"That'd be pretty sick."
53:10;53:11;"- I'm sick with that."
53:11;53:16;"- But that means if you get an Oakland A's edition"
53:16;53:17;"of Hackney Diamonds,"
53:17;53:21;"especially if the Rolling Stones hang it up"
53:21;53:24;"anytime in the next 10, 20 years,"
53:24;53:29;"you'll be sitting on an extremely rare piece of vinyl."
53:29;53:32;"I think that could be going for upwards of $10,000."
53:32;53:34;"Any vinyl collectors out there,"
53:34;53:37;"buy the Oakland A's edition of Hackney Diamonds."
53:37;53:39;"That's my Jim Cramer mad money pick"
53:39;53:42;"for what to do with your life savings."
53:42;53:45;"I would invest heavily in the Oakland A's edition"
53:45;53:46;"of Hackney Diamonds."
53:46;53:48;"Cash out in 10, 20 years."
53:48;53:50;"You'll be happy."
53:50;53:56;"- I gotta just imagine they did some kind of market research"
53:56;54:01;"of baseball fans and Rolling Stones fans."
54:01;54:02;"- Old dudes."
54:02;54:02;"- Do you know what I mean?"
54:02;54:04;"We're just like old dudes and they're like,"
54:04;54:06;"this is real and this is going to sell."
54:06;54:12;"That they can just see the guys at the stadium or whatever"
54:12;54:16;"and just be like, I just love this."
54:16;54:18;"- The vinyl situation's out of control."
54:18;54:21;"I think when I was in Ohio, I sent you guys a picture."
54:21;54:26;"I was in a Walmart in like,"
54:26;54:27;"I think it was called Eaton, Ohio."
54:27;54:29;"It was like 30 miles West of Dayton,"
54:29;54:31;"really in like farm country."
54:31;54:33;"And I went into the bathroom in the Walmart,"
54:33;54:34;"I just come out of the bathroom"
54:34;54:37;"and there's a whole rack of newly reissued vinyl."
54:37;54:39;"And there was like eight copies"
54:39;54:42;"of John Coltrane, ""The Love Supreme"""
54:42;54:45;"in this Walmart for sale in rural Ohio."
54:45;54:49;"And I was like, man, I get it if they're going to reissue,"
54:49;54:54;"like Taylor Swift, whatever, Aerosmith's greatest hits."
54:54;54:56;"- I just, well, ""Love Supreme"" is an all-timer."
54:56;54:57;"- It's an all-timer."
54:57;55:01;"I just, I'm dying to know how many of those ""Love Supremes"""
55:01;55:04;"are moving in that rural Ohio Walmart for like,"
55:05;55:09;"it wasn't like a 1599 reissue either."
55:09;55:14;"It was like, you know, what everything costs now, $40."
55:14;55:17;"I don't know, I just, I'm so confused"
55:17;55:21;"by this corporate retail, you know, vinyl."
55:21;55:25;"- Right, like how many copies of ""Love Supreme"" are moving?"
55:25;55:29;"Because you would generally think that the type of person"
55:29;55:32;"who wants a ""Love Supreme,"" and I'm sure there's,"
55:32;55:36;"in rural Ohio, there's some jazz fans dotted around,"
55:36;55:40;"you know, but like, do they want to buy it in person at-"
55:40;55:43;"- Like it's an impulse buy at Walmart."
55:43;55:46;"- Yeah, or if you're that person, do you wait until,"
55:46;55:49;"you know, you go into Chicago for a weekend"
55:49;55:51;"and go to like a cool record store and buy it,"
55:51;55:52;"or do you buy it online?"
55:52;55:54;"- Or just order it."
55:54;55:55;"It is like, yeah."
55:55;55:59;"- I mean, maybe it's a bit like the gift industry"
55:59;56:01;"where, you know, the same way you're like,"
56:01;56:04;"oh God, it's someone's birthday, what do you get 'em?"
56:04;56:06;"And it's like, you kind of, there's like stores"
56:06;56:08;"that are just like, this is random stuff"
56:08;56:09;"that feels like a nice gift."
56:09;56:10;"Are they going to love it?"
56:10;56:11;"Are they going to use it?"
56:11;56:12;"Who knows?"
56:12;56:14;"But you know, candles or weird kitchen supplies"
56:14;56:17;"that nobody ever uses again, that kind of stuff that like,"
56:17;56:20;"so maybe somebody runs in there and is like,"
56:20;56:24;"oh, my grandson is in jazz band"
56:24;56:26;"at the regional high school."
56:26;56:29;"I've heard of John Coltrane, I'll get him a ""Love Supreme."""
56:29;56:30;"- It's like a coffee table book."
56:30;56:31;"- Exactly, yeah."
56:31;56:33;"- And there's a guy or a couple guys,"
56:33;56:35;"and they're like, oh, this guy just loves jazz."
56:35;56:39;"So this guy now has like 15 copies"
56:39;56:42;"of the vinyl for a ""Love Supreme."""
56:42;56:44;"For every time someone goes in there,"
56:44;56:46;"I got to get my friend who likes jazz something."
56:46;56:48;"- My name is Farmer Bill."
56:48;56:52;"I'm known as the jazz farmer of the Eaton, Ohio area."
56:52;56:54;"I'm one of many farmers."
56:54;56:56;"Everybody knows I love jazz."
56:56;56:58;"I play tenor saxophone."
56:58;57:01;"And this Christmas, I received eight copies"
57:01;57:04;"of a ""Love Supreme"" by John Coltrane"
57:04;57:06;"from eight different people."
57:06;57:09;"That's what happens when you're the jazz farmer in the area."
57:09;57:12;"They cleaned out Walmart."
57:12;57:15;"It could happen."
57:15;57:16;"- Yeah."
57:16;57:17;"- And it's a shame too,"
57:17;57:18;"'cause there's so many other albums I don't have yet."
57:18;57:20;"I don't have ""Giant Steps."""
57:20;57:22;"I don't have my favorite things."
57:22;57:24;"They just keep giving me a ""Love Supreme"""
57:24;57:25;"over and over again."
57:25;57:27;"On my list, I was really hoping"
57:27;57:32;"for this very rare Japanese reissue of a Eric Dolphy live,"
57:32;57:35;"but everybody always gives me John Coltrane,"
57:35;57:36;"""A Love Supreme."""
57:36;57:39;"Guys, you think I don't have that?"
57:39;57:40;"You kidding me?"
57:40;57:42;"(jazz music)"
58:11;58:12;"(jazz music)"
58:12;58:15;"(trumpet music)"
58:36;58:37;"(trumpet music)"
58:37;58:38;"- I'm trying to think of like,"
58:38;58:41;"what are the most random baseball teams?"
58:41;58:42;"The Florida Marlins comes to mind."
58:42;58:45;"Milwaukee Brewers seems real deep."
58:45;58:47;"We're probably just offending somebody"
58:47;58:48;"who's like, that's my team."
58:48;58:51;"Kansas City Royals."
58:51;58:53;"Kansas City Royals, Hackney Diamonds."
58:53;58:56;"I think that's the first example I came up with."
58:56;58:59;"I was just like, what's a deep team?"
58:59;59:02;"I've never fully accepted the Diamondbacks or the Marlins."
59:02;59:05;"Have there been new teams since then, Matt?"
59:05;59:07;"- Tampa Bay."
59:07;59:09;"- Oh, Buccaneers?"
59:09;59:12;"- Tampa Bay and Arizona are the two newest."
59:12;59:12;"- The Buccaneers are-"
59:12;59:14;"- Oh, double rays."
59:14;59:17;"- Yeah, they're the rays now."
59:17;59:18;"- Just the rays, not the double rays."
59:18;59:20;"- Yeah."
59:20;59:22;"Marlins, rays are pretty-"
59:22;59:24;"- Tampa with a baseball team?"
59:24;59:25;"Too deep."
59:25;59:27;"- Didn't they throw in a, did they throw in a Canada team?"
59:27;59:28;"I can't remember."
59:28;59:29;"- Well, you know, there was always,"
59:29;59:30;"well, there used to be the Montreal Expos who left."
59:30;59:31;"- The Expos."
59:31;59:33;"- Well, the Expos, after the Expos."
59:33;59:34;"I thought they had another-"
59:34;59:35;"- Blue Jays. - Yeah, Blue Jays."
59:35;59:36;"- Yeah."
59:36;59:36;"- Yeah, the Blue Jays."
59:36;59:38;"- Back to back, they went back to back."
59:38;59:41;"- Yeah, well, you know, it's a famous team,"
59:41;59:43;"but it's pretty random 'cause now that they changed"
59:43;59:48;"their name is the Guardians, the Cleveland Guardians."
59:48;59:50;"They were getting some heat for their previous name,"
59:50;59:51;"the Cleveland-"
59:51;59:52;"- They changed their name?"
59:52;59:53;"- I didn't know that."
59:53;59:53;"- Yeah. - Oh, wow."
59:53;59:54;"- When that happened."
59:54;59:55;"- Right?"
59:55;59:56;"- What is the-"
59:56;59:58;"- I guess I'm the only baseball junkie here."
59:58;01:00:01;"- That's a terrible name, the Guardians?"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"- Oh yeah, that's, Ezra's not joking around."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"They really did it."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"- What is it in reference to?"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- Guardians of the Galaxy, I think."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"It's kind of a hot movie, the past-"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"- No, the team's name-"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"- Hot movie series."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"- Reference the Guardians of Traffic,"
01:00:13;01:00:17;"eight monolithic 1932 art deco sculptures"
01:00:17;01:00:21;"by Henry Herring on the City's Hope Memorial Bridge."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- Okay."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"- Which is adjacent to Progressive Field, Jake."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"- Oh boy."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- I just don't like it."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Yeah, I just think of the Guardians of the Galaxy."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"- No, I get it, they had to change the name,"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"but wait, were there some other runners up?"
01:00:33;01:00:37;"Didn't they have some like cool names they considered?"
01:00:37;01:00:37;"- I think it's pretty cool."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"- That maybe were too spicy or something?"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"- The new team logo is pretty cool."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"It's got like a baseball with wings on it and a G."
01:00:45;01:00:49;"Oh, spiders, they wanted to be spiders."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Munici-"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- See, yes, I knew there was a-"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"- The Cleveland Spiders."
01:00:53;01:00:53;"- That's kind of cool."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- It's better."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"- Wait, municipals?"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"- Terrible."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"(laughing)"
01:00:58;01:00:58;"- That's worse than guardians."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- Better than guardians."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"- Better than guardians?"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh, here's-"
01:01:03;01:01:03;"- Yes, definitely."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"- You're gonna love this, rockers."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"The Cleveland Rockers."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"- Oh, like because of the hall of fame?"
01:01:10;01:01:10;"- Yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"- I like it better than guardians."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- What was the Drew Carey show?"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Did they have a, it was like Cleveland Rocks."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"- Oh, the Cleveland Rocks?"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"- Yeah."
01:01:19;01:01:24;"- Or also, you know how one of the newest hockey franchises"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"is the Seattle Kraken?"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"- Oh yeah."
01:01:27;01:01:31;"- And it was interesting to me that it's not a plural noun."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"It's just the Seattle Kraken."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"And Cleveland had an opportunity to really just like"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"flex on them and do something different."
01:01:38;01:01:42;"Every single major league team ends with an S."
01:01:42;01:01:46;"They could have been like the Cleveland Experience"
01:01:46;01:01:51;"or the Cleveland, I don't know,"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"like the Cleveland, just some kind of abstract"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"singular noun."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- But I think you're saying something interesting"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"in general, maybe you're supposed to,"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"it refers to all the players and not the mascot,"
01:02:03;01:02:07;"like even if you were the Cleveland Bear."
01:02:07;01:02:07;"- Yes."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- It just sounds better."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- It sounds hard."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- Yeah, definitely sounds hard."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"- Remember we were talking about that trend"
01:02:13;01:02:18;"in coastal urban areas for restaurants"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"that are kind of like sentences,"
01:02:20;01:02:24;"burgers never say die, all this stuff."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"- Burger, burgers she wrote."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- Burger she wrote."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"And there's some other good ones, just like--"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- The Cleveland Burger."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"- The Cleveland Burger."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- What about the dogs?"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"The Cleveland dogs, that'd be cool."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- That's pretty sick."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- Cleveland dogs."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- Or just the Cleveland dog."
01:02:37;01:02:41;"- Oh, what about, okay, go with the Cleveland Meat"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"because it sounds like meat cleaver."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- Oh, I like that."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"Or the Cleveland Cleavers."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Oh yeah, the Cleavers."
01:02:47;01:02:52;"I mean, honestly, the Cleveland Meat Cleavers"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"sounds good too."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"- But what about some far out thing"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"like the Cleveland Welcome to Clevelands?"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Just some kind of like trippy thing"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"where you're kind of using like,"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"what's the motto of Cleveland?"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"The city motto."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"- What about the Cleveland Welcomes You?"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- Yes."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- Oh, oh, oh, progress and--"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"- Kind of like, basically like a small time"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"psychedelic band from the late '60s."
01:03:12;01:03:15;"The Cleveland Welcomes You."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- That's pretty good."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"Progress and prosperity is the motto."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- The Cleveland Progress and Prosperity,"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"or just the Cleveland Prosperity."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"- Yeah, the Cleveland Prosperity is pretty good."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- Ladies and gentlemen, we're the Cleveland Prosperity."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"We're very excited to play some baseball for you tonight."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"(all laughing)"
01:03:32;01:03:38;"And then just some like, some loser walks out"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"and is like, ""Oh yeah, we're the Milwaukee Brewers."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"Boo!"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"So boring."""
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Ladies and gentlemen."
01:03:45;01:03:50;"Ladies and gentlemen, we're the Cleveland Prosperity."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"And tonight we're gonna play this game called baseball."
01:03:52;01:03:57;"Anyway."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"- That is a great band name."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"The Cleveland Prosperity is epic."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"- You know, actually, I know a guy"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"who works for the Guardians."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- Really?"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"- He's a friend of a friend."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"He's a great guy, I always liked him."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"I'm not gonna blow up his spot."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"And actually, that's probably why I know a bit about this,"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"because I remember talking to him and I was like,"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"""Whoa, what was this name change like?"""
01:04:18;01:04:19;"And he was like, ""Oh bro, it was crazy."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"You know, telling me the, no joke,"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"the inside baseball take on the name change."""
01:04:25;01:04:27;"And it was, of course, was like high stakes."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"And they couldn't, they had to be really careful."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"They didn't pick another name they had to change."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"That would have been a disaster."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"So yeah, just dealing with all that stuff"
01:04:35;01:04:38;"and making sure that nobody else had the name"
01:04:38;01:04:41;"and all that stuff, it sounded like a stressful moment"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"for the organization."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"But I think they gave the Guardians a shot."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"Nobody likes it."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Let's go for the Cleveland Prosperity."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"We've already tested it."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"People are excited about it."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"- You know, I'm from, I think the only city"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"where every one of my professional team names"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"has been changed."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Oh, Washington, D.C.? - Oh, Washington, D.C.?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Yeah, break it down."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"- Well- - You used to have the Senators."
01:05:03;01:05:05;"- Right, I didn't used to have a base."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"Yes, you used to have the Senators, but that was,"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"and I think as an organization, they ended in,"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"basically my team was Baltimore,"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"but let's call that if I had just been a bit older,"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"they would have had the Senators."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Then they brought the team back,"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"became the Nationals for baseball."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"- Wait, so you're saying the Senators"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"were like a long time ago?"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"50s, 40s? - The Senators were, yes."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Yes, but just so you, but yes,"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"so that one I feel like less of a connection to,"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"but growing up, it was the Senators,"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"but then they did bring them back while I was there"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"and they became the Nationals."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"So you consider that a name change."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"We just had, we had no team for a minute."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"- Yeah, yeah. - So there's the Ottawa"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Senators too."
01:05:40;01:05:44;"Did Ottawa Canada take over the name or is that?"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"- I thought it just sort of shuttered,"
01:05:46;01:05:50;"but then my basketball team was the Bullets,"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"and because DC was the crime capital of the world,"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"you know, that was the murder capital through the 80s."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"- Not the world, the US."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"- No, no, no, no, they would say"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"it was the murder capital."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"I mean, growing up, look at it,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I mean, whether it was or was not,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"I know it's an exaggeration,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"but it was the murder capital."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"It was the murder capital."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"- No, I remember it had a bad, yeah, the Bullets."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"- Bad rap. - Yeah."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- And they change."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"- What sport were the Bullets?"
01:06:15;01:06:15;"- Basketball."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"- That's crazy."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"They changed it to the Wizards?"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"- The Wizards, which I remember,"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"I remember also being like, this is,"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I mean, anybody that went from the hard Bullets"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"to the Wizards, like no one was happy with that."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"- Why can't these people come up with decent names?"
01:06:29;01:06:29;"Oh my God."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"- Yeah, and then I just looked this up"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"because I actually, 'cause,"
01:06:33;01:06:37;"and then obviously the Washington Redskins,"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"which make the Cleveland Indians look"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"incredibly progressive,"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"had really held onto that name for a really long time."
01:06:44;01:06:47;"And to the point where I actually,"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"during this conversation I looked up,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"I thought they were still called the Redskins,"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"but no one wanted to say the name."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"So basically-"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"- Did the Redskins ever get a new name?"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"- They just did, it looks like."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"- 'Cause they were just called"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"the Washington Football Team or something."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"- Yes, we would just, people just would call,"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"'cause my brother is a huge fan of Washington,"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"and you would just say, I'm rooting for Washington"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"or the Washington Football Team."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"- Oh my God."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"- 'Cause you just couldn't,"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"and sort of, you just couldn't say it."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"And now it looks like it's the Washington Commanders."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"- Oh yeah, so the Commanders?"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"- I mean, this is a-"
01:07:19;01:07:19;"- The Wizards?"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"- This is awful to me."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"- Yeah."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"- The Wizards, yeah."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"And the Nationals."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"- I, yeah, these are all terrible names."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"- We've lost 'em all."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"- Now obviously, Cleveland should have called themselves"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"the Cleveland Bullets."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"It was up for grabs."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- Yeah."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"- You know, Cleveland is probably not as dangerous"
01:07:38;01:07:41;"as DC was in that era."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"The Cleveland Bullets, yeah,"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"we hit the ball faster than a bullet."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Oh, are you promoting violence?"
01:07:46;01:07:50;"No, we just hit the baseball faster than the bullet"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"right out of the park, home run."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"We're the Cleveland Bullets."
01:07:54;01:07:58;"It's a great name, and you know that people like it."
01:07:58;01:08:01;"Yeah, the Washington Commanders is also very ominous."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"Commander."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"- It's like a Handmaid's Tale, right?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- Yeah."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"- They have commanders."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"- Yeah, they should have had a little more fun"
01:08:09;01:08:12;"or specific, like the Admirals would have been better."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"The Washington Admirals."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"- Yup."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"- The Washington, even the Colonels would have been better."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- What about like, oh, you know what'd be sick?"
01:08:19;01:08:23;"Like name it after a former president, like the Clintons."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"- The Washington Clintons."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"That would have gone, people would have loved that."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"The Washington Obamas."
01:08:29;01:08:33;"- That's pretty good, right?"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"- Oh, come on."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"It should have been the Washington Monuments."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"- Oh yeah."
01:08:37;01:08:41;"- Or back to my singular idea, the Washington Monument."
01:08:41;01:08:45;"Just bring a big inflatable Washington Monument with you"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"when you go to another city."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Just the guys run out, it's hard."

01:10:30;01:10:33;"but that the commanders, the team's just sold."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"So now they might be like, that name was whack"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"and we're gonna change that name again."

01:10:51;01:10:53;"(laughing)"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- Just get crazy with it."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"- What about, yeah, just like an animal name,"
01:10:57;01:11:02;"like the foxes, the dogs, you know,"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"something like kind of cute,"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"like, you know, like there's the cubs."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"- I've always liked the name, like the dirty dogs."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- The Washington dirty dogs?"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- You know, something like that."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"- Yeah. - The Washington dogs, yeah."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"- Like the trashers. - Just the Washington dogs."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"Yeah, 'cause also just like own, yeah, own it."
01:11:17;01:11:21;"Just be like the messy bad boys."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"- What about something vulgar?"
01:11:23;01:11:26;"Something vulgar, oh, like (beep) or a (beep)"
01:11:26;01:11:27;"like a (laughing)"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"- The Washington (beep)"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"(laughing)"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"- I don't know, I'm sort of liking the--"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"- The Washington-- - I'm sort of liking--"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"- The Washington team name cannot be televised."
01:11:36;01:11:40;"- I'm sort of liking Ezra's the Washington messy bad boys."

01:11:42;01:11:45;"- We're the messy bad boys and we're here to say."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"I love the trippy idea too."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"What's the name of the Lana Del Rey album?"
01:11:51;01:11:55;"Did you know there's a tunnel under--"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"- Tunnel underneath Ocean Boulevard."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"- There's a lot of did you knows you could come up with"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"about DC, like, aren't there,"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"isn't there like a weird train system for the senators"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"that goes underground?"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"The Washington, did you know that there's a weird train"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"system underground for the senators to use?"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"The Washington, did you know that Thomas Jefferson"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"laid this city out with Masonic symbols?"
01:12:17;01:12:22;"The Washington, the Washington, did you know"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"you don't actually have to pay your income tax"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"'cause the Federal Reserve is a private company?"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"(laughing)"
01:12:29;01:12:33;"I'm telling you, make the Washington football teams"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"name a question, you will go down in history"
01:12:36;01:12:40;"as the coolest football team of all time."
01:12:40;01:12:44;"Break the mold, do something original."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"I would love to just give a sports team a crazy name."
01:12:48;01:12:53;"- It is wild that no one's done it."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"There hasn't been some just like psycho billionaire"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"that's bought a team that's been like,"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"let's just, who cares?"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- Well, I'm sure you probably get a lot of static"
01:13:01;01:13:05;"from Roger Goodall."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"(laughing)"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"These people don't want change."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"I mean, honestly, I even think in the NHL,"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"I was surprised that they got away with the Seattle Kraken."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Like it wouldn't be shocking if somebody had come down"
01:13:17;01:13:21;"from the NHL and just said, guys, it's gotta be a plural."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"- What is the Kraken?"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"- That's the Seattle NHL team."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"And a Kraken is a mythological beast"
01:13:26;01:13:31;"that's like a giant squid that would take down boats."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"- That's cool."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"- But I could see what you're saying."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"But I was thinking about what Sanbo was saying"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"that the guy that created Minecraft"
01:13:40;01:13:45;"has just bought Cleveland and he's named it the (beep)"
01:13:45;01:13:45;"- Right."
01:13:45;01:13:46;"(laughing)"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"- You know?"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"- Yeah, it's like, I mean, it's kind of like"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"crypto.com arena."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"- Yeah."
01:13:52;01:13:52;"- Or--"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"- The Cleveland (beep)"
01:13:54;01:13:55;"- I just thought of another one."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"(laughing)"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"If anybody hates this discussion, I'm sorry."
01:13:59;01:13:59;"- F you arena."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- We're really enjoying ourselves."
01:14:01;01:14:05;"Also, you know how like there's so many great countries"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"that have an and, like Turks and Caicos?"
01:14:08;01:14:09;"- Trinidad and Tobago."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"- Trinidad and Tobago."
01:14:10;01:14:15;"If one had an and in it, that'd be sick."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"Like, well, for it could have been"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"the Washington master and commanders,"
01:14:18;01:14:22;"or, you know, the Washington dogs and cats."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"(laughing)"
01:14:23;01:14:24;"Or cats and dogs."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"(laughing)"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"- The apples and oranges."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"- The Washington apples and oranges."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"- What if it was the other way?"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"What if it was two cities collabing"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"with a single team name?"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"You know, adjacent states or not,"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"both of them, neither one of them"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"can afford their own full team."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"They collab."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"(laughing)"
01:14:46;01:14:50;"Now you've got the Chicago and Las Vegas."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"That'd be pretty sick."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"- Yeah, totally."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"Or what if you created just like"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"the most hated team of all time?"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"That was the New York and LA,"
01:14:59;01:15:02;"like the New York and LA elites."
01:15:02;01:15:03;"And the whole thing about the team"
01:15:03;01:15:08;"is like introducing the first bi-coastal team."
01:15:08;01:15:12;"And it's like, are you a businessman, a movie producer?"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"And you find just like,"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"half your time in New York, half your time in LA."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"Aren't you sick of missing Dodgers or Yankees games?"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"You don't know which way is up."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"Well, we got the team for you."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"- The coastal elites."
01:15:24;01:15:27;"- The coastal, the bi-coastal elites."
01:15:27;01:15:31;"The first, the world's first baseball team"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"that has equal, an equal footprint in both cities."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"- In the two best cities in America."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"- The two best, the absolute best."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"- The two best cities in America."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"- The absolute best cities."
01:15:44;01:15:48;"And they build an identical arena in both places."
01:15:48;01:15:52;"The menu in the VIP club is exactly the same."
01:15:52;01:15:57;"So if you're like the business guy,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"it's like you always can catch,"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"oh, and also they play every game twice."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"So you never miss one."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"The first one they play normally,"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"and then the second one they'd kind of like recreate."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Anyway, you go to your same seat,"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"the parking lot's exactly the same."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"They got the exact same food in the lounge,"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"and your loyalty is no longer split."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"- What's that bi-coastal elite menu"
01:16:22;01:16:23;"looking like in the lounge?"
01:16:23;01:16:26;"- You're getting like a chocolate fountain,"
01:16:26;01:16:30;"martinis, oh yeah."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"- I've definitely, definitely like Wagyu burgers"
01:16:32;01:16:33;"and truffle fries."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"- Oh yeah, okay, now we're talking."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"- And a chopped salad."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:16:40;01:16:44;"- A $40 Caesar salad, fancy tacos."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"- Oh, Peter Luger, like a nice Peter Luger steak."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"- Yeah, really fancy tacos."
01:16:49;01:16:54;"And you ask, is it possible to get the carne asada taco"
01:16:54;01:16:57;"without the mango chutney?"
01:16:57;01:16:57;"No."
01:16:57;01:17:01;"- No, it's all made off-site."
01:17:01;01:17:08;"- The chef made this decision a long time ago."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"- I'm actually kind of allergic to-"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"- No substitution."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"- I'm allergic to lobster."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Is it possible to get a chicken taco without the lobster?"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"No."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"- What's the corkage fee?"
01:17:20;01:17:26;"- You'll have to have the mushroom taco."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"There's obviously a vegan option."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"They got a great risotto."
01:17:30;01:17:33;"- I love the coastal elite."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"I mean, in some ways we're coming full circle."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"I hadn't thought about it in years,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"but remember when we asked our listeners"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"for some of their like bits they remembered"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"from when we were doing kind of our 200th episode?"
01:17:46;01:17:50;"One was when we did Lord Haddington."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"- Right, who would like brush the home plate off."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"- Well, his butler would come out and brush the plate off."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"'Cause clearly we spent a lot of time on this show"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"trying to make sports more interesting."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Right."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"- And we felt maybe at the time"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"it seemed like baseball was slipping."
01:18:05;01:18:09;"So we were trying to create WWE type characters"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"who have a backstory."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"And like, so you need a heel and like,"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"oh, here comes the fancy boy."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"And you know, like you could picture something like that"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"in WWE and like the Rock is like, what'd you say?"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"And the guy's like, I said, my dad could buy you."
01:18:21;01:18:22;"And then he's like, what?"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"And he grabs him and like body slams him."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"And this would be the same thing."
01:18:26;01:18:30;"Lord Haddington's like the kind of rich guy heel."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"But anyway, he could play for the bi-coastal elites."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- Oh, big time."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"- Yeah, and he comes out."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"- No trade cloths."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"- He comes out in like a Patrick Bateman like kind of suit."
01:18:39;01:18:40;"- Oh yeah."
01:18:40;01:18:40;"- You know, when he plays."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- They just wear straight up suits."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"- In a Valentino straight, Valentino pins drive suit."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"- Oh, also, also the team,"
01:18:47;01:18:50;"they do go between the New York and LA identical stadiums,"
01:18:50;01:18:53;"but outside of that, they don't play away games."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"They will not."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- Oh, right."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"You have to go to them."
01:18:56;01:18:57;"- You come to them."
01:18:57;01:18:59;"- You come to them."
01:18:59;01:18:59;"- I like this."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"All the bad boys are dressed like butlers."
01:19:01;01:19:04;"(laughing)"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"- Ooh, I got an idea."
01:19:07;01:19:09;"No kids allowed."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"- Oh yeah, no kids."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"- A class, no children."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Classy adult affair, right?"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"We don't need that."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"- Yeah, there's like a hot tub section."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"(laughing)"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Like out in right field."
01:19:21;01:19:25;"- Look, some dad brings their kid to the ball game"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"and the guy, the tiki guy goes, ""I'm so sorry."""
01:19:28;01:19:28;"- I'm sorry, sir."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"- Ooh, no children allowed."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"- Sorry, sir. - Oh, also,"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"there's a sharing fee for popcorn."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"(laughing)"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"- Gotta be."
01:19:37;01:19:40;"Oh, what are those bags that Dave Chappelle"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"makes you put your phone into?"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"(laughing)"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"- Yonder bags. - No social media."
01:19:46;01:19:48;"- Yonder bags."
01:19:48;01:19:50;"- Yonder, yeah, yonder, yonder policy."
01:19:50;01:19:53;"- This is very exclusive, this game."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"- There's a little bit of an Alamo Draft House"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"kind of vibe to it."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"- Yeah."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"- Respectful."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"- You gotta sign an NDA."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"- You go to the game."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"(laughing)"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"- You know what also I've never actually seen?"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Is like, 'cause people talked about"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"how like the new Yankee Stadium was actually a bit smaller"
01:20:11;01:20:15;"and it was made more for like the VIPs,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"but one, if you just looked out"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"at like a full half of a baseball stadium"
01:20:20;01:20:24;"and it was all double wide, like first class airline seats."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"(laughing)"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- I thought you were gonna say"
01:20:26;01:20:29;"this baseball stadium sits 400 people."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"- That too."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"(laughing)"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"- It's all, yeah."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"- This is huge, huge, huge stadium."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"- All boxes."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"- There's only seats behind,"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"the only seats are behind on the base."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"- Everybody gets a couch."
01:20:43;01:20:46;"- It's all boxes."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- Yeah."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"- Yeah."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"(laughing)"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"- I think we're onto something."

01:23:22;01:23:23;"Top five?"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"- It's time for the top five."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"Five on iTunes."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"- This week on the top five,"
01:23:31;01:23:35;"we're gonna be comparing the top five hits of 1964"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"with the top five Apple music songs of today."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Why 1964?"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"I think I actually know."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Is that when the Rolling Stones' first album came out?"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"- I'm gonna assume so."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"- Which was called the Rolling Stones."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"It's the second album."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"- Was called England's newest hit makers?"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"That also rules."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"How come nobody does anything like that?"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Billie Eilish's second album"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"is called America's newest hit maker?"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"- That would rule."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"- Okay, number five."
