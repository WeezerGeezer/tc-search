00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles with my good friend Jake Longstreth."
00:06;00:10;"We'll be talking about second career business ventures of notable musicians."
00:10;00:15;"And of course we're talking about one guy that we're a big fan of here at Time Crisis and Stay One,"
00:15;00:16;"and that's Billy Joel."
00:16;00:17;"Big time."
00:17;00:20;"We're gonna count down the top five songs on iTunes."
00:20;00:28;"Currently, right now, 2016, with the top five Billboard hits of this same week in 1968."
00:28;00:32;"We're gonna take a moment to appreciate rock history and the present."
00:32;00:33;"Love it."
00:33;00:34;"This is..."
00:34;00:38;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:38;00:42;"Beats 4 and 1."
00:43;00:49;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:49;00:56;"The war I felt, warmingly, all my rightful chances"
00:56;01:03;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
01:03;01:10;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:10;01:15;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:15;01:21;"Welcome back to Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles, Culver City, Southern California."
01:21;01:27;"I'm rejoined by our West Coast co-host and correspondent."
01:27;01:30;"West Coast co-host. That's a good phrase."
01:30;01:31;"Jake Longstreth. What's up, Jake?"
01:31;01:32;"Hey."
01:32;01:34;"Good to see you in the flesh again."
01:34;01:35;"Yeah, nice to see you."
01:35;01:36;"My man."
01:36;01:37;"Culver."
01:37;01:40;"Back here in Culver City. What's been up with you?"
01:40;01:42;"I bought a guitar yesterday."
01:42;01:43;"Really?"
01:43;01:46;"Yeah, I've been borrowing my friend Zach's guitar for three years."
01:46;01:47;"Like an acoustic?"
01:47;01:51;"No, an electric. I didn't have an electric. My brother stole my electric and then he lost it."
01:51;01:56;"And then when I was out here, I needed a guitar. I borrowed it from my friend Zach."
01:56;01:59;"Then I realized I needed to give back his guitar because it's been three years."
01:59;02:01;"So I went and looked all day Sunday."
02:01;02:03;"Where'd you go? Guitar center?"
02:03;02:05;"I dipped into the Pasadena Guitar Center."
02:05;02:08;"I didn't want to. I was talking all this game the night before being like,"
02:08;02:10;"""I'm not going to go to Guitar Center."""
02:10;02:13;"And then I was rolling with my buddy and he was like, ""Let's just check it out, man."
02:13;02:15;"They have some cool used stuff."""
02:15;02:22;"Guitar Center is... I have nothing against the company, but as a consumer experience,"
02:22;02:24;"it's kind of a nightmare."
02:24;02:25;"Yeah."
02:25;02:29;"I don't like noise, you know? I really hate when there's like competing noise."
02:29;02:34;"Like I've always found South by Southwest, the festival in Texas, very difficult"
02:34;02:39;"to walk down the street and you just hear like all this music blaring out at the same time"
02:39;02:41;"and you can't get a moment's peace."
02:41;02:44;"And when you go to Guitar Center, there's always like a nine-year-old kid"
02:44;02:47;"playing something on a keyboard, just like beats blaring,"
02:47;02:52;"some dude like shredding metal solos. It's kind of brutal."
02:52;02:56;"Shredding metal solos through like a crappy distortion pedal has been like"
02:56;03:00;"the soundtrack of guitar stores for like, what, 35, 40 years?"
03:00;03:02;"[imitates guitar playing]"
03:02;03:07;"It's weird how that's like just become like the standard stock and trade move"
03:07;03:11;"of like dudes checking out guitars. There are so many shredders out there."
03:11;03:15;"I think for a lot of the shredder dudes, they have this incredible talent,"
03:15;03:17;"which is the ability to shred."
03:17;03:21;"And maybe they don't have a band."
03:21;03:26;"Maybe they're like, that kind of guitar work went out of fashion."
03:26;03:28;"I'm trying to think what the equivalent is. It's kind of like,"
03:28;03:32;"so you got some free time and it's like, you just roll over to Guitar Center,"
03:32;03:37;"shred, maybe start a conversation. I don't judge it, but it's like,"
03:37;03:40;"you're looking for an affinity group."
03:40;03:45;"Dude, well, I ended up yesterday at Imperial Vintage Guitars in Burbank."
03:45;03:47;"And this was like a tiny, really cool shop."
03:47;03:51;"And I found this great kind of mid seventies Gibson that I bought."
03:51;03:56;"But in terms of like the guitar store culture, it was so full on."
03:56;03:59;"There was one other dude in the store who was like a flight attendant."
03:59;04:03;"He could talk gear. Like he went there to hang out. He was like, oh,"
04:03;04:05;"I have a flight out of Burbank in a few hours."
04:05;04:07;"I thought I'd just pop by the store."
04:07;04:10;"I just got here from Indianapolis."
04:10;04:13;"I'm shooting up to Juneau, Alaska in a few hours."
04:13;04:15;"So, you know, I just took a few hours to just walk."
04:15;04:19;"And then he was just sort of like, oh yeah, this has DeMarzio pickups on it."
04:19;04:21;"That's not the usual humbucker variety from the mid sev."
04:21;04:23;"He could just like go so deep."
04:23;04:26;"And then he was telling me this story about how Ian Anderson,"
04:26;04:29;"Ian Anderson is the dude from Jethro Tull."
04:29;04:30;"Okay."
04:30;04:34;"Who as of five years ago was the largest salmon importer in Great Britain."
04:34;04:35;"Really?"
04:35;04:36;"Yeah. Like second career."
04:36;04:41;"He got really into like importing like Canadian wild salmon."
04:41;04:45;"I love a feel good story like that because of course it's like meaningful to me,"
04:45;04:49;"but like people who start out in this horrible industry, the music industry,"
04:49;04:55;"and it's always like really nice to hear that they are able like somehow to make"
04:55;04:59;"it out and to just like land in something kind of like cool that brings joy to"
04:59;05:01;"people like salmon importing."
05:01;05:07;"Like I really hope that one day I can get into, I don't know,"
05:07;05:08;"find something to import."
05:08;05:10;"Maybe weed."
05:10;05:14;"I think I'm a little bit late in the weed game, in the weed game, but I don't know."
05:14;05:18;"I just always like to hear good stories about like musicians ending up like,"
05:18;05:21;"because think about it when you're 65,"
05:21;05:26;"would you rather be schlepping around the world, touring,"
05:26;05:32;"having to do like 90 minutes of stretching before you go on stage just so you"
05:32;05:37;"don't hurt yourself or sitting in a gorgeous office with, you know,"
05:37;05:40;"a beautiful mahogany desk, leather chair,"
05:40;05:44;"just on the phone with your suppliers or whatever, just like, you know,"
05:44;05:47;"bringing this like delicious fish into the country that you're from."
05:47;05:49;"It just sounds so much better."
05:49;05:50;"Yeah."
05:50;05:53;"And especially if you're like a rock flute guy, like Ian Anderson,"
05:53;05:56;"you'd have to have some serious warmups."
05:56;05:58;"Oh yeah. Think about all the lung capacity."
05:58;05:59;"Can you imagine like,"
05:59;06:01;"I think he used to jump around a lot with the flute."
06:01;06:02;"He was like the Pied Piper."
06:02;06:04;"I don't know why it was on this tangent,"
06:04;06:10;"but I remember watching a Jethro Tull show from like 82 in like Orlando on"
06:10;06:12;"YouTube."
06:12;06:17;"I was like, that is like the weirdest, deepest context."
06:17;06:20;"[Humming]"
06:20;06:21;"What's their big song?"
06:21;06:22;"Aqualung, bro."
06:22;06:23;"Oh yeah."
06:23;06:29;"Aqualung, my friend, don't you turn away again."
06:29;06:31;"So Jethro Tull, they're like 60s."
06:31;06:32;"Um, I would--"
06:32;06:33;"60s, 70s."
06:33;06:34;"I bet."
06:34;06:37;"Like their heyday was sort of early, mid 70s."
06:37;06:40;"Okay. I really don't know that much about Tull other than that they're famous"
06:40;06:41;"for rock flute."
06:41;06:42;"Maybe we should listen to Aqualung."
06:42;06:45;"So this is their big song."
06:45;06:47;"Is there a flute on it?"
06:47;06:49;"[Humming]"
06:49;06:51;"It's real riffy."
06:51;06:55;"[Humming]"
06:55;06:56;"That sounds familiar."
06:56;06:58;"It's like almost kind of Sabbath-y."
06:58;07:00;"That's cool."
07:00;07:04;"And then there's this cool acoustic part where he's like, he's like,"
07:04;07:05;"oh no, no, no."
07:05;07:06;"It's like the other part."
07:06;07:09;"He's like, ""Snot is running down his nose."""
07:09;07:11;"Snot is running down his nose."
07:11;07:13;"Sitting on a park bench."
07:13;07:15;"All right, I'm getting excited for this."
07:15;07:18;"So to all the Salmon fans out here, we got a hot track."
07:18;07:19;"It might be new to you."
07:19;07:20;"It's actually quite old."
07:20;07:25;"But coming from the second largest importer of Salmon in the U.K.?"
07:25;07:29;"The guy at Imperial Vintage Guitars in Burbank told me that Ian Anderson"
07:29;07:30;"is the largest Salmon importer."
07:30;07:31;"Okay."
07:31;07:36;"This is a hot track coming from a singer, flutist, and Salmon importer,"
07:36;07:39;"Ian Anderson and his group Jet Their Atoll."

13:18;13:20;"To everybody who's just tuning in to Time Crisis,"
13:20;13:22;"Jake recently bought a guitar."
13:22;13:23;"I want to talk about that a little bit more."
13:23;13:24;"Okay."
13:24;13:25;"Why'd you go for a guitar?"
13:25;13:28;"Because probably for the same price you could have maybe gotten"
13:28;13:30;"a new laptop, some CDJs."
13:30;13:32;"Because I wanted to play a guitar."
13:32;13:35;"Maybe you could have gotten like Ableton."
13:35;13:37;"Well, I play live music, Ezra."
13:37;13:38;"To play in your band?"
13:38;13:40;"Yeah, I'm in two bands."
13:40;13:42;"Oh, you're in two bands now?"
13:42;13:43;"Yeah, I've been in two bands for a long time."
13:43;13:44;"I'm in Little Wings."
13:44;13:46;"Oh, you're officially a member of Little Wings?"
13:46;13:47;"Yeah, official member."
13:47;13:50;"And then I'm in Dix, which is Los Angeles'"
13:50;13:52;"premier Grateful Dead cover band."
13:52;13:54;"Are you really?"
13:54;13:57;"Look, you're my favorite, but I'm just curious."
13:57;14:00;"Who's your competition in the Grateful Dead cover band scene in LA?"
14:00;14:02;"Because I feel like this is California."
14:02;14:03;"There must be a lot."
14:03;14:10;"I mean, I say Los Angeles premiere with a degree of facetiousness."
14:10;14:13;"But are you on the radar of these other dudes?"
14:13;14:14;"No, no, no."
14:14;14:15;"I don't think we are."
14:15;14:17;"Because you're playing more to like the Echo Park, Silver Lake crowd."
14:17;14:20;"Yeah, we're like the East Side of LA dead cover band."
14:20;14:22;"There's more of like a legit one that actually has like a fat dude"
14:22;14:23;"who looks like Jerry."
14:23;14:24;"Yep."
14:24;14:27;"There's one that's been around for like 30 years, I think."
14:27;14:31;"And I want to say they're called like Cubessence or something."
14:31;14:32;"Is that a reference to a Grateful Dead song?"
14:32;14:37;"Okay, Cubenescence or Cubensis."
14:37;14:38;"Cubensis."
14:38;14:41;"It's spelled C-U-B-E-N-S-I-S."
14:41;14:44;"And I got to say, I don't know the reference."
14:44;14:45;"Weird name."
14:45;14:46;"Yeah, it's not a good name."
14:46;14:48;"But they've been around for like 30 years."
14:48;14:50;"The cover band world is fascinating."
14:50;14:53;"I remember like reading that there was a Sublime cover band"
14:53;14:59;"that was like really huge because obviously Sublime barely got to tour"
14:59;15:03;"because of the tragic death of Brad, the singer."
15:03;15:06;"So kind of like by the time a lot of people were hearing Sublime"
15:06;15:09;"in the mid-'90s and they were really playing their music on MTV"
15:09;15:12;"and on the radio, he had already passed away."
15:12;15:14;"So there was this like huge void if people wanted to see them."
15:14;15:17;"So there was a Sublime cover band called Bad Fish,"
15:17;15:19;"which is a reference to a Sublime song,"
15:19;15:22;"who was like really doing accurate covers of Sublime"
15:22;15:26;"and coming through places like Wisconsin where Sublime never went"
15:26;15:27;"and just killing it."
15:27;15:28;"Wow."
15:28;15:29;"It's like that--"
15:29;15:30;"Filling the void, dude."
15:30;15:33;"Exactly, that rare instance where a cover band"
15:33;15:35;"essentially can be the band."
15:35;15:38;"Well, yeah, I mean there's Darkstar Orchestra,"
15:38;15:42;"which is like a completely professional Grateful Dead cover band,"
15:42;15:47;"and I feel like members of that have been recruited into the major league,"
15:47;15:52;"so to speak, of like the post-Jerry Garcia touring Grateful Dead"
15:52;15:56;"sort of outfit, whether it's playing with Bob Weir and Phil Lash"
15:56;15:59;"or there's been so many iterations I really can't keep track."
15:59;16:01;"Dude, I just looked up Cube Entrance."
16:01;16:02;"Yeah."
16:02;16:03;"It's a magic mushroom."
16:03;16:04;"Oh."
16:04;16:06;"That's a cheesy way to do it, dudes."
16:06;16:07;"Shots fired."
16:08;16:13;"Shots fired in the Los Angeles-based Grateful Dead cover band community."
16:13;16:19;"We got Jake from PIX throwing some serious shade over at Cubenesscence."
16:19;16:21;"Really rolls off the tongue."
16:21;16:22;"Wow."
16:22;16:25;"It's a Grateful Dead/Incubus cover band."

17:27;17:30;"[laughs]"
17:30;17:34;"from Jethro Tull went on to become a very successful salmon importer."
17:34;17:36;"That got us thinking about,"
17:36;17:39;"what are the kind of second acts that artists can have?"
17:39;17:40;"- Right."
17:40;17:42;"- Because, as we all know,"
17:42;17:46;"the muse will only give an artist so much in a lifetime."
17:46;17:46;"- Right."
17:46;17:49;"- We can't all be Paul McCartney, but..."
17:49;17:50;"- We can't all be Neil Young,"
17:50;17:52;"although Neil has a second act in a weird way."
17:52;17:55;"- No, Neil's, I mean, Neil's... - His weird Pono thing."
17:55;17:57;"- Yeah, he's still out there on the road, but it's interesting."
17:57;18:00;"It's like, at some point, with any exciting job,"
18:00;18:02;"you kind of reach the end of the road."
18:02;18:04;"You've, maybe, you're like, ""What's it all about?"""
18:04;18:05;"Maybe you get interested in other things."
18:05;18:08;"So, we kind of wanted to find out"
18:08;18:12;"what other second acts there have been for famous musicians."
18:12;18:15;"And since we started talking about a salmon farmer,"
18:15;18:18;"we can start with Terminator X."
18:18;18:19;"You know who that is, Jake?"
18:19;18:19;"- No."
18:19;18:21;"- He was the DJ for Public Enemy."
18:21;18:22;"- Okay."
18:22;18:23;"- And one of, like, the producers."
18:23;18:25;"At some point in his life,"
18:25;18:29;"he was this very prominent member"
18:29;18:33;"of one of the most radical, progressive rap groups"
18:33;18:34;"in the world, Public Enemy."
18:34;18:36;"But, like Bob Dylan,"
18:36;18:39;"he had a kind of life-changing motorcycle accident in 1994."
18:39;18:40;"- Whoa."
18:40;18:44;"- And after that, he became an ostrich farmer."
18:44;18:45;"- Are you serious?"
18:45;18:45;"- Yeah."
18:45;18:46;"- Where?"
18:46;18:48;"- He bought a 15-acre farm in North Carolina."
18:48;18:48;"- Whoa."
18:48;18:50;"- Apparently, this is a real quote."
18:50;18:53;"He said, ""I made Fear of a Black Planet,"
18:53;18:55;"and it takes a nation of millions to hold us back."
18:55;18:57;"Now I'm going to raise giant birds."""
18:57;18:59;"- What a long, strange trip it's been."
18:59;19:01;"- In a weird way, it makes sense."
19:01;19:03;"Public Enemy was always, like, very critical of the status quo."
19:03;19:06;"Like, it's easy to look at that and be like,"
19:06;19:07;"""What? You were in this, like, cool rap group,"
19:07;19:09;"and now you raise ostriches?"""
19:09;19:10;"Doesn't make sense."
19:10;19:11;"Or maybe it makes a lot of sense."
19:11;19:13;"They were always about, like, kind of shaking things up,"
19:13;19:15;"like, speaking truth to power."
19:15;19:17;"There is a way in which I think sometimes, like,"
19:17;19:19;"very radical people,"
19:19;19:20;"sometimes the most radical thing they can do"
19:20;19:22;"is do something kind of traditional,"
19:22;19:24;"like get back to the earth,"
19:24;19:25;"tend to farm."
19:25;19:28;"- And I wouldn't say that raising ostriches"
19:28;19:29;"is, like, the status quo."
19:29;19:30;"So, I mean, in that sense, there's—"
19:30;19:32;"he's still on his own trip."
19:32;19:34;"- It's not like he was like, ""You know what?"
19:34;19:37;"I made a bunch of great albums with Public Enemy,"
19:37;19:39;"and I'm really excited for my first year"
19:39;19:40;"as an analyst at Goldman Sachs."""
19:40;19:41;"- Right."
19:41;19:43;"- ""I want to bring that same radical attitude"
19:43;19:45;"to trading stocks and bonds."""
19:45;19:45;"That would be like—"
19:45;19:47;"- Or, like, opening a Toyota dealership."
19:47;19:49;"- Yeah. I feel like baseball players"
19:49;19:52;"always open Toyota dealerships."
19:52;19:53;"- That's like a classic sports move."
19:53;19:54;"- Yeah. - So maybe musicians"
19:54;19:56;"get back to the earth."
19:56;19:58;"Terminator, enter."
19:58;20:01;"Ah, take me out of here."
20:01;20:06;"Terminator, exit."
20:06;20:15;"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,"
20:15;20:20;"go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
20:20;20:23;"The federal government is the number one killer and destroyer"
20:23;20:24;"of black leaders."
20:24;20:25;"Take a look at his style."
20:25;20:26;"Yeah."
20:26;20:28;"Take a check of his sound off the record."
20:28;20:29;"People keeping him down."
20:29;20:30;"Tick, tick, tick in Miami."
20:30;20:32;"Terminator X packs the jam."
20:32;20:34;"Who gives a fuck about a god damn president?"
20:34;20:36;"Anyway, and I'm saying that he's defending the mic."
20:36;20:36;"Yeah."
20:36;20:38;"Who gives a fuck about what they like, right?"
20:38;20:40;"The power is bold."
20:40;20:41;"The rhymes politically cold."
20:41;20:43;"No judge could ever but to handle his load."
20:43;20:44;"Yes, the coming is near."
20:44;20:47;"He's about to become the one and only missionary lord."
20:47;20:49;"Son of a gun going on and on."
20:49;20:51;"That track and the whack explain the neck, y'all."
20:51;20:52;"For the acrobats."
20:52;20:53;"Come on."
20:53;20:54;"You don't push it."
20:54;20:57;"Using your fame as a DJ to sell drugs."
20:57;20:58;"Terminator."
20:58;21:02;"Go ahead and walk the walk."
21:02;21:03;"Terminator."
21:03;21:07;"Go ahead and walk the walk."
21:07;21:07;"Terminator."
21:07;21:11;"Go ahead and walk the walk."
21:11;21:12;"Terminator."
21:12;21:13;"Go ahead and walk the walk."
21:17;21:31;"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
21:31;21:32;"You on the radio."
21:32;21:35;"How long you think we're going to allow you to get away with that?"
21:35;21:36;"He's going to go."
21:37;21:38;"Until he reaches the coast."
21:38;21:39;"Tied wide of his own race."
21:39;21:40;"Playing them coasts."
21:40;21:42;"Understand this type of music is a play of the clan."
21:42;21:45;"You know the pack attacked the man with the palmer's hand."
21:45;21:47;"Police, wild beast, dogs on a leash."
21:47;21:50;"No peace to reach his wife's back in his black piece."
21:50;21:51;"Terminator acts."
21:51;21:52;"Yelling with his hands."
21:52;21:53;"Damn."
21:53;21:54;"Already ruling rent in the jam."
21:54;21:57;"But his guts drive against the belt."
21:57;21:59;"He's banned by his damn self."
21:59;22:00;"Yeah."
22:00;22:02;"His one job called threatening the crowd."
22:02;22:04;"Loud sound, pound, making brothers proud."
22:04;22:09;"Boy, like he's a sign of being in control and you are the ace of black music."
22:09;22:09;"Terminator."
22:09;22:13;"Go ahead and walk the walk."
22:13;22:14;"Terminator."
22:14;22:15;"Terminator!"
22:15;22:19;"Terminator!"
22:19;22:24;"Terminator!"
22:42;22:44;"You in Black Music!"
22:44;22:47;"I'm warning you today, your area's on a roll!"
22:47;22:49;"Getting small, making room for it all!"

22:58;23:00;"If you're thinking I'm breaking, he ain't rocking shit!"
23:00;23:02;"My education is taking you for a long ride!"
23:02;23:04;"I make your brain split and do the..."
23:04;23:05;"Liiiide!"
23:05;23:07;"Lide into infinity and temper that!"
23:07;23:10;"With your hand in your pockets, I know your money is spent!"
23:10;23:12;"Like this, like that, butter for the fat!"
23:12;23:14;"You killed my dog, I'ma slay your cat!"
23:14;23:16;"Just like that, y'all!"
23:16;23:19;"Can you handle it, son? I'm public enemy number one!"
23:19;23:20;"Terminator!"
23:20;23:23;"Go off!"
23:23;23:24;"Terminator!"

23:29;23:33;"Go off!"
23:33;23:34;"Terminator!"
23:34;23:38;"Go off!"
23:38;23:40;"Yeah, Terminator!"
23:40;23:41;"Yeah!"
23:41;23:44;"Rock it like that, like that, like that!"
23:44;23:45;"Yeah, man!"
23:45;23:46;"Yo, that's my weight!"
23:46;23:47;"Terminator!"
23:47;23:48;"Terminator X!"
23:48;23:50;"Drop it until I drop panic, boy!"
23:50;23:51;"Yeah, that's right!"
23:51;23:52;"Hey, yo, Terminator!"
23:52;23:54;"Let 'em know you don't speak with your hands, boy!"
23:54;23:55;"Ha ha!"
23:55;23:56;"Yeah!"
23:58;24:04;"That was ""Public Enemy,"" featuring the production and DJing of Terminator X,"
24:04;24:06;"noted ostrich farmer."
24:06;24:08;"On ""Time Crisis"" today, we're talking about second acts,"
24:08;24:13;"the business ventures of notable musicians,"
24:13;24:18;"and how those grow to even eclipse their primary career as a musician."
24:18;24:22;"There's one guy that we're a big fan of here at ""Time Crisis"" since day one,"
24:22;24:24;"and that's Billy Joel."
24:24;24:25;"Big time."

24:34;24:37;"I was out on Long Island a couple weeks ago."
24:37;24:38;"Oh, yeah?"
24:38;24:42;"I was reading a lot about him and his ex-wife, Christy Brinkley,"
24:42;24:43;"and I saw her in town."
24:43;24:44;"You saw her?"
24:44;24:45;"Yeah."
24:45;24:46;"Just walking down the street?"
24:46;24:47;"Yeah."
24:47;24:50;"Just walking out of the Baskin-Robbins there?"
24:50;24:51;"No, it was at a barbecue."
24:51;24:53;"It wasn't, like, too random."
24:53;24:56;"She was there with--I don't think I'm blowing up her spot--"
24:56;24:58;"but her current boyfriend, John Mellencamp."
24:58;24:59;"Wow."
24:59;25:01;"Of course I support--"

25:09;25:11;"That's--I love that."
25:11;25:12;"Whatever, like, you know."
25:12;25:14;"She likes rockers."
25:14;25:15;"But anyway, so--"
25:15;25:16;"She has great taste, clearly."
25:16;25:18;"She has great taste, and I think she lives out there year-round."
25:18;25:20;"She spends a lot of time out in Sag Harbor."
25:20;25:21;"Amazing person."

25:22;25:25;"She makes her own Prosecco called Bellissima."
25:25;25:26;"Wow."
25:26;25:27;"Yeah, good for her."
25:27;25:30;"I mean, she's one of the greatest models of all time"
25:30;25:32;"and, frankly, a fascinating person."
25:32;25:34;"But anyway--"
25:34;25:35;"Did you see Mellencamp?"
25:35;25:36;"Yeah, he was with her."
25:36;25:38;"What was his vibe?"
25:38;25:39;"Did you meet him?"
25:39;25:40;"No, I didn't meet him."
25:40;25:42;"You know, he seemed like a rock star."
25:42;25:44;"Shades on?"
25:44;25:45;"No, he wasn't wearing--it was at night."
25:45;25:47;"He wasn't wearing shades at night."
25:47;25:49;"Seemed like a lovely couple."
25:49;25:51;"I'll tell you what, they both look good."
25:51;25:53;"I bet. I bet they're working out."
25:53;25:54;"They're both in their 60s."
25:54;25:56;"Personal trainers every morning."
25:56;25:57;"Oh, yeah."
25:57;25:58;"Got to."
25:58;26:00;"Kale shakes."
26:00;26:01;"Yeah."
26:01;26:03;"Sheet placenta facials."
26:03;26:05;"I wonder when John Mellencamp had his first kale shake."
26:05;26:07;"Like, what year?"
26:07;26:08;"2008?"
26:08;26:09;"Yeah."
26:10;26:11;"[laughter]"
26:11;26:12;"Great minds, man."
26:12;26:14;"Mellencamp's personal chef was just like,"

26:17;26:18;"What?"
26:18;26:19;"Sounds nasty."
26:19;26:20;"Bear with me."
26:20;26:21;"Right."
26:21;26:22;"Hear me out."
26:22;26:23;"Chrissy Brings was like,"
26:23;26:26;"""John, your doctor said you got to start eating healthier."
26:26;26:28;"""When those spring chickens--yeah, yeah, yeah."""

27:21;27:23;"We've got down on the Chrissy Brinkley,"
27:23;27:24;"John Mellencamp tangent."
27:24;27:26;"I also want to point out that apparently"
27:26;27:28;"Billy and Chrissy are still very good friends."
27:28;27:29;"That's great to hear."
27:29;27:31;"Because it's really disgusting, I think,"
27:31;27:33;"the way that the public is so fascinated"
27:33;27:35;"by people's personal lives."
27:35;27:37;"This week, Brad and Angelina split up."
27:37;27:39;"Oh, yeah. That was a bummer."
27:39;27:40;"I mean, look, man."
27:40;27:41;"They did what they had to do."
27:41;27:42;"I'm not down on them."
27:42;27:44;"I'm just saying that's a bummer."
27:44;27:46;"Any divorce or breakup is painful."
27:46;27:47;"Yeah."
27:47;27:49;"So even if it's for the right reasons,"
27:49;27:51;"even if everybody will come out happier,"
27:51;27:53;"you have to have compassion for anybody going through that."
27:53;27:54;"Absolutely."
27:54;27:56;"But anyway, you noticed a lot of the people"
27:56;27:58;"wanted to be like, ""Oh, Jennifer Aniston's"
27:58;28:00;"probably really happy about this."""
28:00;28:01;"Really?"
28:01;28:03;"What is this middle school garbage?"
28:03;28:05;"Because first of all, these people should remember"
28:05;28:08;"that not all celebrities are like that."
28:08;28:10;"They're good people, just like you and me."
28:10;28:12;"And they should be like, ""Well, actually,"
28:12;28:13;"Billy Joel and Chrissy Brinkley are tight,"
28:13;28:15;"and she's dating John Mellencamp, so grow up."""
28:15;28:17;"So back to Billy Joel."
28:17;28:19;"Joel and Mellencamp probably crossed paths"
28:19;28:20;"a lot in the mid-'80s, too."
28:20;28:22;"In fact, I bet Mellencamp hung out with Joel"
28:22;28:24;"at one point when he was with Brinkley 30 years ago."
28:24;28:25;"That's amazing."
28:25;28:27;"If I had to guess, I bet that Billy Joel--"
28:27;28:28;"Introduced them."
28:28;28:29;"He maybe even introduced them."
28:29;28:31;"And I think it's also possible that, you know,"
28:31;28:33;"Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen could probably"
28:33;28:35;"never be close friends, because it's too close"
28:35;28:37;"for comfort in New Jersey and Long Island."
28:37;28:39;"So it's like, if you're Billy Joel and, like,"
28:39;28:42;"Springsteen is kind of like your tri-state rival,"
28:42;28:44;"you're not going to be boys with Springsteen."
28:44;28:46;"But, like, Mellencamp, he's like this"
28:46;28:47;"midwestern dude."
28:47;28:49;"That's kind of like a nice--"
28:49;28:50;"could have some nice--"
28:50;28:52;"maybe go on vacation together or something."
28:52;28:55;"So the reason we're talking about Billy Joel"
28:55;28:57;"is because we're talking about the business"
28:57;28:59;"ventures of prominent musicians."
28:59;29:00;"Right."
29:00;29:02;"And a lot of people don't know this about Billy."
29:02;29:04;"One reason that Billy is a G--"
29:04;29:07;"his last album was the one that had"
29:07;29:10;"♪ In the middle of the night ♪"
29:10;29:12;"♪ I was walking in my sleep ♪"
29:12;29:15;"So, like, he literally never put out a dud album."
29:15;29:17;"I'm not going to sit here and say that I'm familiar"
29:17;29:19;"with all the album tracks, but he never put out"
29:19;29:21;"an album that didn't have at least one standout hit."
29:21;29:22;"Mm-hmm."
29:22;29:25;"So his last album--you know, a lot of people,"
29:25;29:28;"they start to make seemingly pointless music."
29:28;29:29;"Sure."
29:29;29:31;"Again, I don't judge, but it's like--"
29:31;29:32;"I think it's interesting that this dude"
29:32;29:34;"made an album in the early '90s,"
29:34;29:35;"had one last big hit--"
29:35;29:36;"It's really rare."
29:36;29:37;"--in the middle of the night, and then it's like,"
29:37;29:39;"""You know what? I'm good."
29:39;29:41;"I've accomplished a lot, made a lot of money,"
29:41;29:43;"written a lot of hits."
29:43;29:45;"I have a beautiful daughter, Alexa Rae Joel,"
29:45;29:47;"with my ex-wife, Christy Brinkley."
29:47;29:48;"Let me just enjoy life."""
29:48;29:51;"And so in 1996, he was looking for something to do,"
29:51;29:54;"and he merged his long-held love of boating"
29:54;29:56;"with his desire for a second career."
29:56;29:58;"This is Wikipedia language, of course."
29:58;30:01;"And he formed, with Long Island boating businessman"
30:01;30:04;"Peter Needham, the Long Island Boat Company."
30:04;30:06;"And on top of that, in 2010, he opened a shop"
30:06;30:08;"in Oyster Bay, Long Island, to manufacture"
30:08;30:11;"custom-made retro-styled motorcycles and accessories."
30:11;30:13;"This is interesting. I didn't know this about Billy."
30:13;30:15;"He likes vehicles."
30:15;30:16;"[laughs]"
30:16;30:18;"High-end luxury vehicles."
30:18;30:19;"Boats and motorcycles."
30:19;30:20;"Yeah."
30:20;30:21;"That makes total sense."
30:21;30:23;"I mean, this guy's been writing great songs for America"
30:23;30:26;"for 20 years, 20-plus."
30:26;30:27;"Yeah."
30:27;30:29;"And now he wants to turn his attention to vehicles."
30:29;30:31;"I wonder if the muse just left him."
30:31;30:34;"Sometimes you just write music by accident."
30:34;30:37;"Like, you sit at the piano, and you come up with something,"
30:37;30:38;"and you're like, ""Oh, that's pretty good."""
30:38;30:40;"It's a mystical process."
30:40;30:41;"It is mystical, and it's weird that, like--"
30:41;30:44;"and he seems like the kind of writer that is really gifted"
30:44;30:46;"in terms of his sense of melody."
30:46;30:47;"Right."
30:47;30:49;"It seems very innate in him, his musical talent."
30:49;30:51;"And it seems odd to me that that would just"
30:51;30:53;"completely vacate."
30:53;30:56;"And I wonder if he does write stuff, and then he's just like,"
30:56;30:58;"""You know what? I don't want to deal with the whole--"
30:58;31:00;"putting out records and all this kind of stuff."""
31:00;31:05;"Maybe Billy's sitting on 40 amazing hits."
31:05;31:07;"You know, a picture that's, like, 1998."
31:07;31:11;"He wakes up, has a cup of coffee, sits down at the piano,"
31:11;31:13;"writes just an incredible song."
31:13;31:14;"Right."
31:14;31:15;"And is like, ""You know what?"
31:15;31:18;"I could take this down to the studio, work on it,"
31:18;31:23;"release it, make a music video, go do the talk show circuit,"
31:23;31:25;"all the garbage that you have to do,"
31:25;31:28;"or I could just leave this beautiful song here"
31:28;31:30;"and head over to my motorcycle shop"
31:30;31:34;"and just rap with the local motorcycle enthusiasts."""
31:34;31:37;"Now, apparently he put out an album of classical compositions"
31:37;31:38;"in 2001."
31:38;31:39;"Oh, I'm familiar."
31:39;31:42;"It's called ""Fantasies and Delusions,"" right?"
31:42;31:45;"The 13th and final studio album."
31:45;31:46;"That doesn't count because--"
31:46;31:47;"No, I agree."
31:47;31:50;"--because ""River of Dreams"" was his last pop album."
31:50;31:51;"Right, totally."
31:51;31:54;"So he put his love of music towards classical composition."
31:54;31:55;"You know what?"
31:55;31:56;"I'll be honest."
31:56;31:57;"I've never actually heard that."
31:57;31:59;"I feel like I'm a bad Joel head."
31:59;32:00;"I haven't either."
32:00;32:01;"We should listen to some of that."
32:01;32:02;"Yeah."
32:02;32:05;"Let's listen to track one, ""Reverie."""
32:05;32:07;"It's 9 minutes and 31 seconds."
32:07;32:08;"I'm in."
32:08;32:09;"We don't have to listen to the whole thing."
32:09;32:10;"No."
32:10;32:11;"What's it called?"
32:11;32:16;"""Reverie,"" and then in parentheses, ""Villa Vest."""
32:16;32:18;"Like his Italian villa or something?"
32:18;32:19;"Yeah, or French."
32:19;32:20;"I don't know."
32:20;32:35;"It sounds like some real classical music."
32:35;32:36;"Yeah."
32:36;32:38;"Well, one thing I also want to point out,"
32:38;32:41;"another reason why Billy's a G, he just composed this."
32:41;32:42;"He's not even playing."
32:42;32:45;"He wrote the music, and it's being--"
32:45;32:46;"Oh, wow."
32:46;32:50;"--performed by the classical pianist, Hyun Ki-joo."
32:50;32:51;"Huh."
32:51;32:56;"I wonder if he felt that he couldn't play it as well as someone else."
32:56;32:57;"I guess so."
32:57;32:58;"I mean, I guess that's--"
32:58;32:59;"Yeah."
32:59;33:00;"Or he just wanted to do it the official way."
33:00;33:01;"I'm a composer."
33:01;33:02;"Right."
33:02;33:05;"This is different than what I normally do."
33:05;33:07;"It'd be interesting to have someone else play it"
33:07;33:09;"and kind of hear their interpretation."
33:09;33:12;"If Billy wanted to, he could be out there scoring films."
33:12;33:13;"Oh, yeah."
33:13;33:16;"I have to say, there's a few moments in this,"
33:16;33:20;"like the chord voicings remind me of Honesty."
33:20;33:21;"(SINGING) Honesty."
33:21;33:25;"How about one more?"
33:25;33:29;"This is Waltz No. 1, Nunley's Carousel."
33:29;33:34;"So the whole album is piano."
33:34;33:37;"I'm wondering."
33:37;33:39;"Yeah."
33:39;33:43;"That's kind of cooler than writing full orchestra."
33:43;33:44;"Yeah."
33:44;33:45;"Just a kind of a sparse piano vibe."
33:45;33:47;"It's kind of tasteful."
33:47;33:50;"Just a deep love of composition."
33:50;33:53;"So this makes sense."
33:53;33:57;"I mean, yeah, Billy, kind of partial retirement."
33:57;34:00;"He's about to go down to the Harley shop--"
34:00;34:01;"Yeah."
34:01;34:02;"--or the motorcycle shop,"
34:02;34:04;"and he's having a cup of coffee in the morning."
34:04;34:08;"Spends an hour or two at the piano."
34:09;34:11;"Yeah, and he's trying something different."
34:11;34:12;"That's cool."
34:12;34:16;"I wonder what the classical community thought of it."
34:16;34:18;"I feel like they're probably a bunch of snobs."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah, I mean--"
34:19;34:22;"They probably treated him like when Kanye started making clothes."
34:22;34:23;"Right."
34:23;34:26;"I can just picture the review just like,"
34:26;34:29;"a tepid imitation of the great masters."
34:29;34:33;"Billy Joel should stick to writing pop songs like Uptown Girl."
34:33;34:34;"Right."
34:34;34:39;"It's funny that he went from writing kind of Frankie Valli pastiche to like--"
34:39;34:42;"I don't even know my classical music well enough to be able to be like,"
34:42;34:49;"""This is kind of like a Chopin thing or a Beethoven piano sonata."""
34:49;34:51;"I really don't know at all."
34:51;34:55;"Well, whatever it is, it's excellent."
34:55;34:58;"Thank you, Billy, for your final studio album."
34:58;35:03;"Oh, dude, I just thought of this."
35:03;35:10;"I have another East Coast rock star who's in the boating business story."
35:10;35:12;"Lay it on me, brother."
35:12;35:13;"Can you guess?"
35:13;35:15;"Another East Coast rock star who's in the boating business."
35:15;35:19;"Rock star, let's say not at the level of Billy Joel."
35:19;35:20;"Okay, so we're not talking Bruce."
35:20;35:25;"A member of a prominent indie band who now runs a sport fishing outfit--"
35:25;35:26;"Oh, Ween."
35:26;35:27;"--out of South Jersey."
35:27;35:28;"Okay."
35:28;35:29;"Yeah, Dean Ween."
35:29;35:30;"And what does he do?"
35:30;35:32;"He runs a sport fishing outfit."
35:32;35:33;"What does that mean?"
35:33;35:34;"That means you catch fish?"
35:34;35:35;"He has a boat."
35:35;35:36;"You pay him."
35:36;35:40;"He takes you out for the day to catch fish in the ocean off the Jersey shore."
35:40;35:41;"That's tight."
35:41;35:44;"And in honor of that, I think we should listen to ""Ocean Man."""
35:44;35:47;"Ocean Man, take me by the hand"
35:47;35:51;"Lead me to the land that you understand"
35:51;35:56;"Ocean Man, a voyage to the corner of the globe"
35:56;35:58;"It's a real trip"
35:59;36:03;"Ocean Man, the crust of a town"
36:03;36:05;"Mounded by bottom sand"
36:05;36:08;"Soaking up the thirst of the land"
36:08;36:12;"Ocean Man, can you see through the wonder of amazement"
36:12;36:14;"At the open mind?"
36:14;36:20;"Ocean Man, the crust is elusive when it casts hold"
36:20;36:22;"To the childlike mind"
36:22;36:26;"Ocean Man, the sequence of a life"
36:26;36:29;"On a breeze in the sand"
36:29;36:31;"Soaking up the thirst of the land"
36:31;36:33;"Ocean Man"
36:33;36:41;"Ocean Man"
36:55;36:58;"Ocean Man, take me by the hand"
36:58;37:02;"Lead me to the land that you understand"
37:02;37:07;"Ocean Man, a voyage to the corner of the globe"
37:07;37:09;"It's a real trip"
37:09;37:14;"Ocean Man, the crust of a town"
37:14;37:16;"Mounded by bottom sand"
37:16;37:19;"Soaking up the thirst of the land"
37:19;37:23;"Ocean Man, can you see through the wonder of amazement"
37:23;37:25;"At the open mind?"
37:25;37:31;"Ocean Man, the crust is elusive when it casts hold"
37:31;37:33;"To the childlike mind"
37:33;37:37;"Ocean Man, the sequence of a life"
37:37;37:39;"On a breeze in the sand"
37:39;37:42;"Soaking up the thirst of the land"
37:42;37:45;"Time Crisis on Beat 1"
37:45;37:47;"That was ""Wean"" with Ocean Man"
37:47;37:49;"You ever go fishing, Jake?"
37:49;37:51;"Yeah, I have. Not ocean fishing."
37:51;37:53;"Do you fish in a lake, a river?"
37:53;37:56;"Yeah, I've done trout fishing in rivers and lakes."
37:56;37:58;"What is fishing all about?"
37:58;38:01;"I feel really disconnected from it. I've never been fishing."
38:01;38:02;"Never?"
38:02;38:04;"No. Is it like..."
38:04;38:07;"I don't have a connection to it. My parents took me"
38:07;38:11;"and I did it and sort of enjoyed it."
38:11;38:14;"What's the difference? Trout fishing, you wear"
38:14;38:18;"big plastic or rubber pants with suspenders"
38:18;38:20;"and you wade into the water and you..."
38:20;38:22;"You could. That's fly fishing."
38:22;38:24;"Oh, fly fishing."
38:24;38:26;"Yeah, and that's much harder to do. It's much more technical."
38:26;38:28;"The casting is much more difficult."
38:28;38:30;"Because when I picture fishing in my mind's eye,"
38:30;38:33;"I can picture the dude in the river fly fishing"
38:33;38:34;"with the suspenders."
38:34;38:38;"And then I can also picture the quiet,"
38:38;38:40;"hanging with the cooler full of brews,"
38:40;38:42;"sitting in the boat."
38:42;38:44;"Sociologically, what's the difference?"
38:44;38:48;"I feel like the kind of fishing where you're in waders"
38:48;38:51;"and out in the river and you're in a sort of technical,"
38:51;38:54;"maybe cramped casting situation."
38:54;38:57;"Those people are maybe more reverent for nature"
38:57;39:01;"and getting out of town and really kind of..."
39:01;39:03;"Right. So either that guy is going to be like"
39:03;39:06;"a third generation Montana dude with a deep connection"
39:06;39:10;"to nature or it's going to be like some LA scumbag"
39:10;39:14;"who's staying in a billion dollar cabin."
39:14;39:16;"Take us fly fishing."
39:16;39:20;"Just like a full Ralph Lauren mega cabin"
39:20;39:24;"to stay in and just breathing the air."
39:24;39:27;"Like your little son wearing waders"
39:27;39:30;"just on his iPad the whole time."
39:30;39:33;"And then there's the scene of the dudes with the cooler brew"
39:33;39:37;"and the baseball game on the radio out in the rowboat,"
39:37;39:40;"sitting in completely placid water"
39:40;39:43;"with an Ikea distribution center"
39:43;39:45;"on the other side of the river from them."
39:45;39:46;"And I don't know."
39:46;39:48;"Yeah, that seems more like just hang out with your buddies"
39:48;39:50;"and drink some beer and maybe just put a worm"
39:50;39:54;"or a lure on a hook and just drop it down"
39:54;39:56;"into the bottom of the lake or the river"
39:56;39:59;"where the fish are and try to catch fish that way."
39:59;40:02;"And it's considered a peaceful activity?"
40:02;40:04;"Yeah. I mean, I'm not that into it."
40:04;40:07;"When I was a kid, I didn't like killing the fish."
40:07;40:08;"It was not fun."
40:08;40:09;"Because what happens?"
40:09;40:12;"The fish bites the hook."
40:12;40:13;"That's brutal."
40:13;40:15;"And it's usually they just get it in their lip."
40:15;40:16;"Oh, God."
40:16;40:18;"And so if you're just doing catch and release,"
40:18;40:19;"you can bring the fish in."
40:19;40:21;"And you're holding the fish and it's squirming."
40:21;40:22;"It's like fighting for life."
40:22;40:25;"And you pull the hook out of its lip and you let it go."
40:25;40:27;"Sometimes they really chomp deep into it."
40:27;40:28;"OK, you know what, man?"
40:28;40:29;"I got a question."
40:29;40:30;"I've been wanting this for a long time."
40:30;40:33;"Catch and release kind of seems more humane"
40:33;40:35;"because you don't actually kill the fish."
40:35;40:37;"But also when you think about it,"
40:37;40:40;"isn't that gnarlier?"
40:40;40:41;"It's one thing to be like,"
40:41;40:45;"I'm a non-vegan human and I eat fish."
40:45;40:49;"So rather than go to the store and buy some Jethro Tull salmon,"
40:49;40:51;"I'm going to go fish, bring it home,"
40:51;40:52;"going to cook it up,"
40:52;40:54;"and it's going to be sustenance for my family."
40:54;40:56;"There's some sort of moral clarity there."
40:56;40:58;"You're like, I think it's OK to eat other animals."
40:58;41:01;"Clearly this person, this imaginary person, is not a vegan."
41:01;41:02;"I think it's OK to eat other animals,"
41:02;41:05;"and I'm going to go do it myself."
41:05;41:07;"Versus the catch and release, which is like,"
41:07;41:08;"you know what, man?"
41:08;41:09;"I'm not going to end this fish's life."
41:09;41:10;"It's just entertainment."
41:11;41:14;"I'm just going to put a hook through its lip,"
41:14;41:16;"pull it out of its natural environment,"
41:16;41:18;"terrify it, and then release it."
41:18;41:20;"Yank it out of its dimension."
41:20;41:22;"Can you imagine you're walking down the street"
41:22;41:24;"and there's like a rope and you just kind of grabbed it,"
41:24;41:25;"and all of a sudden it was just like,"
41:25;41:27;"whoosh, you just like got yanked out of your dimension"
41:27;41:28;"and you're in this other--"
41:28;41:31;"The equivalent would be like if we were walking at the beach"
41:31;41:33;"and picked up like a hoagie."
41:33;41:36;"This already sounds like some corny commercial from the '80s."
41:36;41:37;"A hoagie."
41:37;41:38;"So we're just walking down the beach"
41:38;41:40;"and there's like a hoagie, and we pick it up,"
41:40;41:43;"and then we get dragged into the water, can't breathe."
41:43;41:44;"We're flip-flopping around,"
41:44;41:47;"have some like weird giant sea beasts looking at us."
41:47;41:51;"Oh, and also, of course, we're like gored by some sharp thing."
41:51;41:53;"We're in deep pain, and we're struggling to breathe,"
41:53;41:55;"and then we get thrown back on the beach."
41:55;41:56;"Sounds brutal."
41:56;41:58;"So what's up with catch and release, man?"
41:58;42:00;"Like, why?"
42:00;42:02;"Ezra, it's the sport of it."
42:02;42:03;"Sport."
42:03;42:05;"I haven't gone fishing as an adult."
42:05;42:06;"Doesn't interest me."
42:06;42:07;"If you have children,"
42:07;42:09;"are you going to teach them the ways of fishing?"
42:09;42:10;"No."
42:10;42:11;"Really?"
42:11;42:13;"I mean, if they're dying to go, I'll take them, but I don't--"
42:13;42:16;"It's not something that I feel connected to."
42:16;42:18;"Man, I just don't know."
42:18;42:19;"I mean, I eat fish."
42:19;42:22;"I'd be a hypocrite to be anti-fish--anti-fishing."
42:22;42:23;"Right."
42:23;42:25;"And also, you know there are these shows"
42:25;42:27;"called like Deadliest Catch and stuff?"
42:27;42:28;"Oh, yeah."
42:28;42:30;"Some of these fishermen are out there"
42:30;42:32;"literally risking their lives"
42:32;42:34;"so that we can go to Red Lobster"
42:34;42:38;"and get tilapia with a side of, like, Cajun shrimp."
42:38;42:39;"That's depressing."
42:39;42:42;"Just picture the contrast of, like, the trawler"
42:42;42:44;"in, like, freezing cold Alaska,"
42:44;42:46;"like, people just, like, yelling at each other."
42:46;42:47;"Negative 20."
42:47;42:49;"""What are you doing? What are you doing?"""
42:49;42:51;"Like, a dude's about to fall over, like, perfect storm,"
42:51;42:52;"and it's, like, going back and forth."
42:52;42:53;"Yeah."
42:53;42:55;"And just like, ""J-Bullet in! Bullet in! Oh, my God!"""
42:55;42:57;"Dude's, like, saying prayers, like, ready to die."
42:57;42:58;"Yeah."
42:58;43:00;"And then, like, flash cut three months later,"
43:00;43:02;"just, like, a piece of, like, frozen fish"
43:02;43:04;"getting, like, microwaved."
43:04;43:06;"Like, some 16-year-old kid at the Red Lobster"
43:06;43:09;"is just, like, putting in the deep fryer."
43:09;43:10;"Yeah."
43:10;43:12;"Brings it back out to the family waiting at the table."
43:12;43:13;"""Here you go, sir."""
43:13;43:15;"And then, like, the 12-year-old kid's just like,"
43:15;43:16;"""I don't want this."""
43:16;43:17;"Right."
43:17;43:18;"""Dad, I wanted burgers."""
43:18;43:19;"""Just will you have a bite?"""
43:19;43:23;"On that note, here's the Beatles with ""Octopus's Garden."""
43:23;43:24;"A Ringo track."
43:24;43:28;"# I'd like to be under the sea"
43:28;43:32;"# In an octopus's garden in the shade"

43:39;43:43;"# In his octopus's garden in the shade"

45:58;46:02;"It was the Beatles with ""Octopus's Garden."""
46:02;46:04;"Let's not forget what's happening to our oceans."
46:04;46:06;"Rivers and streams. Lakes."
46:06;46:08;"All of our water."
46:08;46:12;"So today on ""Time Crisis,"" we're talking about second careers."
46:12;46:15;"And, you know, a second career can happen simultaneously with the first."
46:15;46:16;"Yep."
46:16;46:18;"Many Americans work multiple jobs."
46:18;46:21;"So there was a band in the '80s called Glass Tiger."
46:21;46:22;"You remember them?"
46:22;46:25;"Vaguely. That name is incredible."
46:25;46:26;"Glass Tiger."
46:26;46:28;"There's a band now called Glass Animals."
46:28;46:29;"Really?"
46:29;46:30;"Yeah."
46:30;46:31;"I wonder if they're aware of Glass Tiger."
46:31;46:32;"I'm sure."
46:32;46:35;"I was in a band once, and we had a song called ""White Glass."""
46:35;46:37;"What does that mean, ""White Glass""?"
46:37;46:38;"Like a cocaine thing?"
46:38;46:42;"I didn't write the song, but I think it was just trying to sound like Glass Tiger."
46:42;46:44;"# White glass #"
46:44;46:45;"Yeah, basically."
46:45;46:46;"# Black velvet #"
46:46;46:49;"Their big hit was called ""Don't Forget Me When I'm Gone."""
46:49;46:50;"It goes like this."

46:54;46:55;"Oh, yeah."
46:55;46:59;"[rock music]"
46:59;47:01;"Very poppy."
47:01;47:02;"[rock music]"
47:02;47:04;"Not even really rock."
47:04;47:09;"Yeah, just like '80s wholesome pop."
47:09;47:10;"Yeah."
47:10;47:11;"You know this song?"
47:11;47:12;"No."
47:12;47:17;"# You take my breath away #"

47:22;47:25;"# Flames and tears #"

47:27;47:30;"Got that slight '80s shuffle."
47:30;47:32;"Ooh, key change."
47:32;47:36;"So '80s to do that really abrupt key change to the chorus."

47:50;47:53;"I'm not saying it's bad, but you gotta be in a certain mood,"
47:53;47:57;"'cause the big horns, the snare, the reverb."
47:57;48:00;"So anyway, that was Glass Tiger."
48:00;48:04;"And the bassist in Glass Tiger,"
48:04;48:06;"he's already a very successful guy."
48:06;48:07;"What's his name?"
48:07;48:09;"His name's Wayne Parker."
48:09;48:10;"I know that sounds made up."
48:10;48:13;"Why does that sound made up, Wayne Parker?"
48:13;48:14;"I don't know."
48:14;48:15;"It just sounds like a made-up name."
48:15;48:18;"So anyway, Wayne Parker was the bassist in Glass Tiger,"
48:18;48:21;"and he now is the owner of SkyShed POD,"
48:21;48:24;"a company that sells personal observatory domes"
48:24;48:26;"to amateur astronomers."
48:26;48:29;"They're located just outside of Stratford, Ontario."
48:29;48:30;"I guess these guys are Canadian."
48:30;48:31;"So what are you getting?"
48:31;48:32;"I don't even understand what that is."
48:32;48:35;"I think you're getting some form of telescope."
48:35;48:37;"A personal observation dome?"
48:37;48:40;"I think it's like a telescope with--"
48:40;48:41;"I don't know, man."
48:41;48:43;"It's something for amateur astronomers"
48:43;48:45;"to, like, behold the universe."
48:45;48:46;"That's cool, man."
48:46;48:48;"That's super niche."
48:48;48:50;"First of all, shout-out to Wayne Parker."
48:50;48:51;"That's cool."
48:51;48:56;"But, like, do you ever, like, think about hobbies"
48:56;48:58;"and just, like, get depressed?"
48:58;48:59;"What do you mean?"
48:59;49:02;"Like, grown men trading baseball cards?"
49:02;49:03;"[laughs]"
49:03;49:04;"Yeah, that's a good example."
49:04;49:05;"That's depressing."
49:05;49:07;"I remember I used to be really into cards when I was a kid,"
49:07;49:09;"and I'd go to the baseball card shop in the strip mall"
49:09;49:10;"near my house,"
49:10;49:13;"and there'd be, like, 35-year-old dudes in there."
49:13;49:16;"And I remember even being, like, 12 and just being like,"
49:16;49:18;"""What's up with-- What's going on here?"""
49:18;49:20;"They were probably looking at you, like,"
49:20;49:21;"""What's this little 12-year-old twerp doing?"
49:21;49:23;"He doesn't appreciate baseball cards."""
49:23;49:24;"Yeah."
49:24;49:25;"You know what it is, man?"
49:25;49:27;"I feel like I've probably said this before on the show."
49:27;49:31;"It's, like, I hate that our society gives us"
49:31;49:34;"very mixed messages about hobbies."
49:34;49:36;"So say you're an amateur astronomer,"
49:36;49:38;"and you're, like, really passionate about it,"
49:38;49:40;"and it's like, ""Hey, I'm just doing this for me."
49:40;49:41;"I'm interested in reading what, like,"
49:41;49:42;"professional scientists are up to,"
49:42;49:44;"and I like checking out the stars and stuff."""
49:44;49:45;"I don't know."
49:45;49:47;"There's so much pressure in our culture to, like, go pro."
49:47;49:48;"Mm."
49:48;49:50;"So I feel like the same way it's kind of like"
49:50;49:52;"with the weekend warrior local dude"
49:52;49:54;"playing covers at the barn grill."
49:54;49:55;"I don't know."
49:55;49:57;"Like, our culture doesn't respect it."
49:57;49:59;"And maybe I think about that a lot, 'cause, like,"
49:59;50:01;"yeah, I've played music professionally,"
50:01;50:02;"but at one point in my life,"
50:02;50:04;"I might just be, like, living in the suburbs,"
50:04;50:06;"you know, just getting a few, like,"
50:06;50:09;"dads from my son's school together"
50:09;50:12;"to just, you know, play Mumford & Sons covers."
50:12;50:15;"I'm thinking that there's a slot for you in pics down the road."
50:15;50:16;"It's very possible."
50:16;50:17;"But I'm just saying, like, why--"
50:17;50:18;"I don't know."
50:18;50:21;"For some reason, the phrase ""amateur astronomer"""
50:21;50:22;"made me melancholic."
50:22;50:23;"Wow."
50:23;50:24;"'Cause I love it."
50:24;50:25;"Hell yeah, man."
50:25;50:26;"Like, be an amateur astronomer."
50:26;50:28;"But then we live in this culture where it's like"
50:28;50:30;"if you're not Neil deGrasse Tyson,"
50:30;50:32;"you're a weirdo."
50:32;50:34;"Like, sorry, maybe this dude didn't have time"
50:34;50:36;"to go get a PhD in astronomy."
50:36;50:37;"Yeah."
50:37;50:39;"Maybe he was, like, you know, working three jobs."
50:39;50:42;"Maybe he got in a hometown jam or something."
50:42;50:44;"Like, things didn't go his way."
50:44;50:45;"But you know what I mean?"
50:45;50:47;"It's like our culture doesn't respect amateurs."
50:47;50:49;"If you're an amateur, you're putting time and energy"
50:49;50:52;"into not being ""productive."""
50:52;50:54;"Right, because our society values everything"
50:54;50:56;"in terms of, like, productivity."
50:56;50:58;"And if you're not making money doing it--"
50:58;51:00;"I'm thinking of this from a male perspective"
51:00;51:01;"'cause I identify as male."
51:01;51:03;"But, like, you're out with the wife."
51:03;51:04;"Yeah."
51:04;51:06;"Maybe it's a double date, her friend from work."
51:06;51:07;"Mm-hmm."
51:07;51:09;"And you're talking to her husband,"
51:09;51:10;"and maybe you're like--"
51:10;51:11;"he's like, ""What are you up to?"""
51:11;51:15;"And you're like, ""I'm a bit of an amateur astronomer."""
51:15;51:18;"I'd rather talk amateur astronomy with him, though,"

51:19;51:20;"Well, exactly."
51:20;51:21;"Yeah."
51:21;51:23;"I mean, that is kind of what makes people human."
51:23;51:24;"Exactly."
51:24;51:25;"All right, now I got it."
51:25;51:26;"Okay."
51:26;51:28;"What makes people human is not your job, necessarily."
51:28;51:29;"It could be."
51:29;51:31;"But it's, like, you know, what makes you happy"
51:31;51:32;"and passionate and curious."
51:32;51:35;"And yet, I don't like that our culture"

59:35;59:40;"Call me back, I'll get on track, I swear."
59:40;59:43;"I want to go."
59:46;59:48;"I want to roam."
59:52;01:00:07;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig, Beats 1."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"So you're listening to Time Crisis."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"We've been talking a lot about the meaning of life,"
01:00:12;01:00:17;"second careers, amateur versus professional."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"It's tough out there, man, I got to say."
01:00:20;01:00:24;"I don't know how people find meaning in modern American life."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"It's tough."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Smell the roses, man."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"That's what I'm saying."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"So that in mind, we're going to take a moment"
01:00:30;01:00:35;"to appreciate rock history and the present."
01:00:35;01:00:39;"And we're going to do that with a segment we call Top 5."
01:00:39;01:00:46;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"So this week's Top 5, we're going"
01:00:47;01:00:52;"to do a more complicated one, as we sometimes do on Time Crisis,"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"where we compare the Top 5 songs on iTunes currently,"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"right now, 2016, with the Top 5 Billboard"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"hits of this same week in 1968."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Love it."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Why did we choose 1968, Jake?"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Well, this has been a theme recently"
01:01:08;01:01:13;"on the show the last few months because of the election."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"And people are drawing-- especially during the primaries,"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"people were drawing a lot of comparisons to 1968."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"Tumultuous time in the country."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Exactly."
01:01:22;01:01:28;"I mean, with Trump being the nominee, I mean, that is--"
01:01:28;01:01:33;"we are on the precipice of a serious, tumultuous, crazy time."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"It's already tumultuous, racism, people getting killed."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"It's horrible."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And now, yeah, we're holding our breath."
01:01:40;01:01:44;"Is it going to get better, worse, or the same?"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"A lot of people would accept the same."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"But whatever, 1968 was also a crazy time."
01:01:48;01:01:53;"So how does the popular music of an era reflect the time?"
01:01:53;01:01:53;"Does it?"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"If it-- maybe not."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"Maybe not at all."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"So let's start by going back to the number 5 song--"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Young Girl."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"It's not Young Girl."
01:02:01;01:02:06;"This week in 1968, America was in flames."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"And the number 5 song on the charts"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"was the 1910 Fruit Gum Company with 1, 2, 3, Red Light."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"Are you familiar with that group, the 1910 Fruit Gum"
01:02:16;01:02:16;"Company?"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"I've heard of it."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Let's see if you recognize this."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"[MUSIC - THE FRUIT GUM COMPANY, ""1, 2, 3, RED LIGHT""]"
01:02:21;01:02:34;"Every time I try to prove I love you, 1, 2, 3, red light."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"You stop me."
01:02:36;01:02:40;"Baby, you ain't right to stop me."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"You stop me."
01:02:44;01:02:51;"Every time I make a move to love you, 1, 2, 3, red light."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"You stop me."
01:02:53;01:02:57;"Baby, every night you stop me."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:03:00;01:03:04;"Stop the game."
01:03:04;01:03:08;"You've got too much to lose."
01:03:08;01:03:12;"If you stop me again, that's when we might end."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"So please don't refuse."
01:03:14;01:03:24;"Every time I make a move to love you, 1, 2, 3, red light."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Don't stop me."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"Baby, you ain't right to stop me."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Don't stop me."
01:03:34;01:03:41;"Every time I try to prove I love you, 1, 2, 3, red light."
01:03:41;01:03:45;"Don't stop me when I know I'm right."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Don't stop me."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:03:48;01:03:54;"Wait, hold on a second."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"The lyrics of this song are, every time I make a move"
01:03:56;01:03:59;"to love you, you stop me?"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"1, 2, 3, red light?"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Yeah."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"That's not going to do well on the charts in 26."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"So basically, this guy--"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"this is a song about being annoyed that somebody"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"doesn't want to have sex with you?"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"It's almost a lateral move from Gary Puckett."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Yeah."
01:04:11;01:04:15;"God, what kind of nonsense was on the charts back then?"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"OK, that's a pretty big difference from 2016."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Nobody's trying to listen to a pop song about--"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:04:23;01:04:27;"--where a guy is being cutesy about, like, damn,"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"I'm trying to have sex with you, and you keep saying no."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"It's bothering me."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"1910 Fruit Company."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"That's a terrible band name, by the way."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"It's a terrible band name."
01:04:35;01:04:38;"It's a terrible sentiment for a song."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"No wonder they're called the 1910 Fruit Gum Company,"
01:04:40;01:04:43;"because it sounds like their morality is, like,"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"early 20th century, man."
01:04:45;01:04:47;"It's weird, too."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"I think we've touched on this, how, like, the top five"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"from '68 is, like, shockingly square."
01:04:53;01:04:53;"It's bubble gum."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"And just, yeah."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"Yummy, yummy, yummy."
01:04:56;01:04:56;"Right."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"It's always these, like, really cheesy songs."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"It's really--"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"This picture, like, you and your buddies are in Vietnam."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Yeah."
01:05:03;01:05:05;"You got, like, shrapnel in your arm playing cards,"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"and, like, this is just coming over the radio."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"1, 2, 3, red light."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"You stop me."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"I'm sort of like, where's the Creedence Clearwater?"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"Where's the, you know--"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"You know, look, man."
01:05:16;01:05:16;"--the Beatles?"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"A lot of times--"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"The stuff that you kind of remember."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"Well, yeah, you remember it."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Or we remember it, culturally."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"Yeah."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"But that doesn't mean that's what was popping then."
01:05:24;01:05:24;"Right."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"So let's see what's going on in today's world."
01:05:26;01:05:29;"The equivalent of that song, number five on iTunes,"
01:05:29;01:05:34;"this week in 2016 is Kiara with a song called ""Gold."""

01:05:37;01:05:40;"Wow."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"I mean, right off the bat--"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Trippy."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"--they didn't even know how to do that in 1968."
01:05:44;01:05:48;"You could have gotten the best producers and engineers in 1968"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"given them a year, and they could not have"

01:05:52;01:05:52;"Nope."

01:06:50;01:06:52;"This is like the chorus."

01:07:01;01:07:07;"I think it's-- she's in a difficult time in her--"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"everything's falling apart, and the chopped up vocals"
01:07:10;01:07:17;"metaphorically depict the confusion of the narrator's--"

01:07:36;01:07:37;"That sounds weird."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"Maybe she was in a party that took place in a basement,"
01:07:40;01:07:44;"and she made out with the brother or something."

01:18:14;01:18:17;"This one is an iconic song of 1968."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"- Wait, give me a hint."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"- It's a song that came out in 1968"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"by a group from England."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"- Beatles."

01:18:43;01:18:45;"I think the story of this song"

01:25:22;01:25:24;"but also felt appropriate for the film."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"- Well, that's why Paul's song is more human,"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"'cause it returns to what we were saying before."
01:25:28;01:25:32;"Paul's song was just, for the sake of the song,"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"it just sprang up completely pointless."

01:28:10;01:28:11;"Yeah."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Let's picture like 1968."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"We're like out there, you know, protesting."
01:28:16;01:28:19;"Our buddies are getting sent to Vietnam"

01:28:47;01:28:50;"Totally. You'd be like, ""You're appropriating my message."""
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Yeah."

01:28:53;01:28:55;"Although, I don't want to be too hard on the rascals"
01:28:55;01:28:59;"'cause maybe like they had other songs that contextualized it."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"But it's also like, it's kind of the beginning"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"of how you see the countercultural movement"

01:29:23;01:29:24;"The Coca-Cola ad."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"Well, that was such an amazing episode"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"'cause it really is about capitalism"

01:29:29;01:29:30;"The house always wins."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"But it's like, it's so sick."
01:29:33;01:29:36;"I mean, I don't even want to make a value judgment anymore,"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"but it's like, it's so easy to take a message"

01:29:43;01:29:44;"And I get it."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Like, whatever."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"I'm not against selling things, but it's like--"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"So it's not their fault that they made"

01:30:33;01:30:34;"Okay."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"It's called ""Forever Country,"""

01:30:58;01:30:59;"I mean, that's cool."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Yeah, no, it's a funny cause, but--"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"I'm gonna assume that they're probably also"

01:35:31;01:35:33;"I love this song."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"So what's the story about?"
01:35:34;01:35:37;"She got in trouble with the local PTA?"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Yeah."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"And then she calls out everyone else in town for being a hypocrite."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"What is the PTA mad about?"
01:35:44;01:35:48;"I guess we're here."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"She's a single mom."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Oh, good for her."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"She's a single mom that kind of parties."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"She goes on dates."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"Who cares?"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Little girl that way."
01:36:11;01:36:15;"So she gets a letter in the mail from the PTA that's just like, ""What's up?"""
01:36:15;01:36:20;"We don't like the way you live your life."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"Turns out they're going to meet that afternoon."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"Oh, she better go."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"1968, rocking the mini skirt."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Get ready."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"What's she going to say?"
01:36:52;01:36:55;"Yep, classic hypocrite married dude."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Housewife drinking at home."
01:37:08;01:37:13;"These people have their own peccadilloes."
01:37:16;01:37:18;"That one's always kind of mystified me."
01:37:18;01:37:21;"She's dancing naked around."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Nothing wrong with that."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"A lot of drinking and sex in the small town."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Nice."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"Oh, that's what she wished happened."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"It's a fantasy?"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"No."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"It's real."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"She said, ""I wouldn't put you on."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"It happened just this way."""
01:38:06;01:38:07;"I see."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Great song."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"I love that."
01:38:18;01:38:24;"1968, the country is like reckoning with the modernity,"
01:38:24;01:38:28;"a new culture, and there's like a country song that's about like,"
01:38:28;01:38:31;"""Hey, let's not be hypocrites here."""
01:38:31;01:38:35;"We can point out that, oh, the new generation dresses differently."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"They maybe have more open attitudes about sex, but as always,"
01:38:38;01:38:43;"the people with really puritanical ideas about sex often tend to be"
01:38:43;01:38:49;"behind closed doors doing gnarly stuff like, ""This woman is single."
01:38:49;01:38:53;"She's out there doing her thing."""
01:38:53;01:38:55;"She's wearing a miniskirt."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Nothing wrong with that."
01:38:56;01:39:01;"Meanwhile, you got these weird married people mad at her"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"for having a free sexual life."
01:39:03;01:39:08;"The harshest one is, ""Ask Mr. Taylor why his secretary had to leave town."""
01:39:08;01:39:09;"Right."
01:39:09;01:39:10;"Whew."
01:39:10;01:39:15;"Like, say what you will about people with multiple sexual partners"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"or whatever, at least they're honest."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Like, what's the problem?"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"Yeah, I got a divorce."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Big deal."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Man, you think that's still happening?"
01:39:22;01:39:26;"Single moms wearing miniskirts and, like, getting the side eye"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"from the other parents at school?"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Big time."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"That's ridiculous."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"Yep."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"People are judgmental, man."
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Not a lot's changed in some ways, man."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Human nature, dude, human nature."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"Good for you, Jeannie C. Riley."

01:39:47;01:39:50;"is going to quite speak to the times in the same way, but maybe."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"Let's find out."
01:39:51;01:39:56;"Oh, it's that same song ""Closer,"" the Chainsmokers featuring Halsey."
01:39:56;01:39:59;"Is this a song about the mattress and Boulder?"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Yeah, exactly."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Jesus."
01:40:02;01:40:06;"I'm surprised the turnover on the top five on iTunes is so slow."

01:40:09;01:40:15;"It's a weird contradiction in a way because there's so much material"

01:40:30;01:40:32;"What's happening next week?"
01:40:32;01:40:35;"If the song's all over the radio, it's like nothing is blanketing"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"the culture like this."
01:40:37;01:40:42;"Isn't it funny how terrestrial radio still has a huge role to play?"
01:40:42;01:40:45;"Yeah, well, guess what, man?"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Not everybody has an iPhone."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"I mean, I hear the radio in my car, and I hear the radio,"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"as we've discussed before, like retail producers."
01:40:52;01:40:56;"Right, well, and also, like, people always forget this just because"
01:40:56;01:41:02;"maybe terrestrial radio is shrinking, but it's still this huge thing."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"It'll take a while for it to shrink to not have an iPhone."

01:41:32;01:41:34;"Sure, I'm down with it."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"But maybe even--"
01:41:36;01:41:39;"because I was just, like, in the Home Depot the other day,"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"and I noticed--"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"This is a classic Depot track."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"Yeah, no, there was, like, three or four songs I heard at the Home Depot"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"that had been in the top five of Time Crisis."
01:41:47;01:41:51;"But I was like, well, the Home Depot's not playing terrestrial radio."
01:41:51;01:41:54;"Like, there's a Home Depot playlist, I'm sure."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"There's some--"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Yeah, maybe it is just based on the top 40."
01:41:57;01:42:00;"Yeah, it's probably, like, if your gig was to program"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"the music being piped into the Home Depot,"
01:42:02;01:42:06;"you're probably looking at, like, Billboard and iTunes."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Or maybe there's some company that just does, like,"
01:42:08;01:42:12;"kind of, like, we'll do an inoffensive mix of today's hits."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"And yesterday's classics."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"And yesterday's classics you can subscribe."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"And maybe it's, like--"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"Maybe you don't work for Home Depot,"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"but you work for some independent company, and it's, like--"
01:42:22;01:42:26;"We put together playlists that are going out to Home Depot, Lowe's--"

01:42:30;01:42:32;"Let's see, here's what I'm wondering."
01:42:32;01:42:35;"I wonder if a home improvement warehouse has a different playlist"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"than an office supply place."
01:42:37;01:42:41;"Like, is the Home Depot playlist slightly skewed?"
01:42:41;01:42:45;"Because I would think the Home Depot playlist would be more like classic rock."
01:42:45;01:42:49;"Like, I would think I'd go into the Home Depot and hear, like, The Eagles."
01:42:49;01:42:54;"But no, it's, like, this kind of stuff, which is kind of weird to me."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"[MUSIC - THE EAGLES, ""BITE THAT TATTOO""]"
01:42:59;01:43:10;"Well, that's a good question."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"When, like, the big dogs--"
01:43:11;01:43:14;"Because surely at Home Depot there are people who put a lot of thought"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"into the retail experience."
