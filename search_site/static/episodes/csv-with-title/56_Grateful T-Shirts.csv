00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, back once again. So much to discuss. We'll talk to Mordecai Rubenstein, aka Mr. Mort,"
00:09;00:15;"about Grateful Dead fashion. We'll talk to Jake about his Grateful Dead cover band's glorious"
00:15;00:26;"return. We'll also count down the top five songs of today and 1979. All this, plus much more,"
00:26;00:33;"more. Today on Time Crisis with Ezra King, piece one."
00:33;00:40;">> They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"You were a part, wobbly me, of my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
01:02;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:08;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:19;"Leave me lonely man."
01:19;01:22;">> Time Crisis back once again."
01:22;01:25;"Sitting here with Jake, Los Angeles, California."
01:25;01:27;">> What's up, mid-November."
01:27;01:29;">> Mid-November, LA."
01:29;01:31;"Finally getting to cool off a little bit."
01:31;01:33;">> Called November rain."
01:33;01:35;">> That's right."
01:35;01:38;"So I've seen you more recently than the past two weeks."
01:38;01:40;"Seen you a couple times."
01:40;01:41;">> Yeah."
01:41;01:43;">> Once you came by the studio."
01:43;01:44;">> Yeah."
01:44;01:49;">> Can you go on record and say that a Vamp Weekend album is being made, at least?"
01:49;01:50;">> It's sounding great."
01:50;01:51;">> All right, thank you."
01:51;01:52;">> I'm really excited."
01:52;01:54;"I don't know how much detail you want me to go into."
01:54;01:56;">> No, I don't want you to go into any detail beyond that."
01:56;01:58;"I just want you to know that you came to the studio,"
01:58;02:00;"you witnessed a group of people hard at work."
02:00;02:04;">> Oh yeah, and I brought by a very special guest."
02:04;02:08;">> Jake brought by the guitarist from his Grateful Dead cover band."
02:08;02:09;">> Right."
02:09;02:11;">> Came through, was putting down some tasty licks."
02:11;02:13;"Great having him in the room."
02:13;02:17;"But before you guys came to the studio, I saw you guys play."
02:17;02:18;">> Yeah."
02:18;02:21;">> I was really excited to see Jake's Grateful Dead cover band play"
02:21;02:24;"because I hadn't seen them in years."
02:24;02:27;"So I remember the first time I saw you, it might have been three years ago."
02:27;02:29;">> I think you saw our first show."
02:29;02:30;">> I might have seen your first show."
02:30;02:32;">> Which I want to say was late 2014."
02:32;02:34;">> Okay, so yeah, solid three years ago."
02:34;02:39;"And then since then, from hanging out with you, I've become way more of a Deadhead."
02:39;02:43;"I certainly know way more of the catalog, so I was kind of very excited to see you guys again."
02:43;02:49;"Now, a big thing happened with your Grateful Dead cover band."
02:49;02:52;">> Well, first of all, I want to get your read on the show."
02:52;02:54;">> Oh, well, the show was great."
02:54;02:56;"To be fair, I only caught the first set."
02:56;02:57;">> Right, right, right."
02:57;02:58;">> Jake's band played two sets."
02:58;02:59;"I caught the first set."
02:59;03:01;"It was very Europe '72 heavy."
03:01;03:02;">> Yeah."
03:02;03:03;">> Which I appreciated."
03:03;03:04;">> Yeah, second set, we took it out."
03:04;03:08;">> That's when you guys started going to some of that early Dead, just jamming."
03:08;03:09;">> We did some dark stuff."
03:09;03:13;">> You know, we just jammed things out a little bit."
03:13;03:19;">> And the funny thing is that even at this-- it was at a bar called the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
03:19;03:22;"I'm sure there were a lot of friends and family there, but also you just got like some straight-up Deadheads"
03:22;03:24;"who heard there's a Dead cover band."
03:24;03:25;">> Oh, absolutely."
03:25;03:30;">> And then even in the little courtyard of this bar, there were people selling bootleg Dead merch."
03:30;03:31;">> Oh, yeah."
03:31;03:32;">> Which was sick."
03:32;03:36;"The question everybody at home wants to know is what's up with the name change?"
03:36;03:43;"Because Jake's cover band, Grateful Dead cover band, for years was called Dick Picks."
03:43;03:48;"That's a classic cover band move is that your name is a pun on something related,"
03:48;03:52;"sometimes very tangentially, to the band."
03:52;03:56;"You know, like you could make some kind of joke about something related to the band."
03:56;03:57;">> A song title."
03:58;03:59;">> Or a lot-- like a record."
03:59;04:00;">> Yeah."
04:01;04:10;"And in this instance, Dick Picks is a play on words because it's referencing a compilation of dead--"
04:10;04:11;">> Bootlegs."
04:11;04:15;">> --of dead bootlegs that the Grateful Dead started releasing officially in the '90s called Dick's Picks."
04:15;04:17;">> There was a guy named Dick Lotvala--"
04:17;04:18;">> Yeah."
04:18;04:24;">> --who was one of the first tapers, and the Dead actively encouraged taping within their fan base,"
04:24;04:31;"which means someone shows up with a reel-to-reel unit, and they maybe get a little real estate on the side stage,"
04:31;04:36;"or they're in the very front of the show, and they're taping the show, and then they're trading tapes."
04:36;04:37;">> Right."
04:37;04:40;">> This guy Dick Lotvala was an early innovator in this."
04:40;04:46;"He taped, like, every show, and then he would curate which he thought were the best shows."
04:46;04:48;">> So it's a guy named Dick picking--"
04:48;04:49;">> Yeah."
04:49;04:50;">> --his favorite Grateful Dead bootlegs."
04:50;04:51;">> Dick's Picks."
04:52;04:58;">> So you guys, when you started the band in 2014, your plan was you took Dick's Picks,"
04:58;05:01;"any Grateful Dead fan worth their salt who knows what Dick's Picks are--"
05:01;05:02;">> Of course."
05:02;05:09;">> --and you named the band a very similar phrase, which in the rise of, you know, smart phones and the Internet,"
05:09;05:11;"also came into prominence, Dick Picks."
05:11;05:12;">> Dick Picks."
05:12;05:13;">> So you called yourself Dick Picks."
05:13;05:17;">> Dick Picks, and that's P-I-C-S."
05:17;05:18;">> Right, like pictures."
05:18;05:19;">> Yeah."
05:19;05:22;">> I know that might sound a little convoluted to people, but for a Grateful Dead fan,"
05:22;05:25;"a lot of people would hear that name and be like, ""Nice."""
05:25;05:27;"It's like a fun play on words for a Grateful Dead fan."
05:27;05:29;">> I would say it blew minds."
05:29;05:31;">> Some people loved it."
05:31;05:35;">> Yeah, some people were like, ""That is the most genius cover band name I've ever heard,"""
05:35;05:41;"because it's going from the 1960s bootleg guy who's curating this live show--"
05:41;05:42;">> Yeah."
05:42;05:48;">> --to full Internet era, iPhone era, very lewd--"
05:48;05:49;">> Phenomenon."
05:49;05:51;">> Exactly."
05:51;06:20;"[ Music ]"
06:20;06:42;"[ Music ]"
06:42;06:46;">> It's got all the hallmarks of a good cover band name."
06:46;06:47;">> Yep."
06:47;06:50;">> It's got the wheels to the heads."
06:50;06:53;"It's a play on words, except not everybody likes Dick Picks."
06:53;06:55;">> Yeah, Dick Picks got a lot of heat."
06:55;06:56;">> So Dick Picks got some heat."
06:56;06:58;">> We got some heat from friends of ours--"
06:58;06:59;">> Yeah."
06:59;07:01;">> --who, you know, I absolutely respect their point of view--"
07:01;07:02;">> Yeah."
07:02;07:05;">> --and people who aren't friends of ours that I don't even know,"
07:05;07:11;"who were like, ""That name is offensive and triggering and brutal."""
07:11;07:14;"And I almost understood the logic of that."
07:14;07:15;">> Right."
07:15;07:17;">> It took me a long time to come around to--"
07:17;07:19;">> The kind of visceral emotional part."
07:19;07:24;">> --accepting--yeah, and being like empathetic and accepting the emotional truth"
07:24;07:26;"of maybe what they were saying."
07:26;07:30;">> Who knew that talking about your Grateful Dead cover band would intersect so well"
07:30;07:33;"with what's going on in the news right now?"
07:33;07:34;">> Ezra, the Dead are timeless."
07:34;07:35;">> The Dead are timeless."
07:35;07:36;">> I mean, they're always relevant."
07:36;07:37;">> Yeah."
07:37;07:38;">> I mean--"
07:38;07:41;">> Not only the Grateful Dead back, but yeah, it's a very timely topic"
07:41;07:45;"because you have a lot of people, victims of abuse coming forward."
07:45;07:47;"You have Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein."
07:47;07:51;"People are talking for the first time about not just the most violent types of assault"
07:51;07:55;"but other types of sexual misdemeanor."
07:55;07:57;">> Yeah, unsolicited aggression."
07:57;08:01;"And so this had been a conversation going on in the band for a while."
08:01;08:04;"And also the band had not been active for the past year."
08:04;08:05;">> Right."
08:05;08:09;">> We played some shows in November of 2016 and then took a year off."
08:09;08:12;">> You're coming back 2017, and you've got a choice on your hands."
08:12;08:15;">> And I'm about to post on my Instagram account about the show,"
08:15;08:18;"and I'm like, ""I don't want to post about a dick pic show."""
08:18;08:20;"The tide turned."
08:20;08:25;">> Finally it went from you intellectually respecting the point of view of your critics--"
08:25;08:26;">> Yep."
08:26;08:29;">> --to being like, ""You know what? I don't feel good about this name."""
08:29;08:31;">> Yeah, I was going to be stressed out posting it."
08:31;08:32;"I didn't feel good about it."
08:32;08:34;"So we had always joked that we should--oh, no."
08:34;08:40;"Okay, because in 2015 we had played a fundraiser at an elementary school."
08:40;08:43;"So we went by Richard Pictures."
08:43;08:44;">> Right."
08:44;08:45;">> Dick pics."
08:45;08:46;">> It seemed inappropriate for this."
08:46;08:47;">> It became Richard Pictures."
08:47;08:48;">> Got it."
08:48;08:51;">> Because, yeah, that would be crazy to go to elementary school and be like,"
08:51;08:54;"""Hey, we're Dick pics,"" and all these parents being like, ""What is going on?"""
08:54;08:55;">> Right."
08:55;09:00;">> So when the show was coming up at the Old Town Pub in Pasadena last Thursday,"
09:00;09:03;"we were like, ""You know what? Richard Pictures."""
09:03;09:07;">> So now on the band is called Richard Pictures."
09:07;09:08;">> Yep."
09:08;09:11;"Give it another four years and that will be inappropriate."
09:11;09:14;"But for right now, we are Richard Pictures."
09:14;09:16;">> I mean, it's still rooted in the other name."
09:16;09:17;">> Mm-hmm."
09:17;09:18;">> So you're right."
09:18;09:21;"It's not a fully clean break, but I respect that you--"
09:21;09:22;">> We've obscured it."
09:22;09:26;">> You've obscured it, which I think--well, at the very least--and to be fair,"
09:26;09:30;"I think we both agree that something that we probably don't realize,"
09:30;09:35;"being heterosexual men, is that getting an unsolicited dick pic"
09:35;09:40;"could be beyond stressful and be beyond unwanted."
09:40;09:45;"It could--like you said, it could trigger and could really even traumatize somebody."
09:45;09:48;"And also, dead cover band. It's got to be good vibes."
09:48;09:49;">> It's got to be kind."
09:49;09:50;">> It's got to be kind vibes."
09:50;09:53;">> Yeah, it's not like some brutal punk band."
09:53;09:55;">> I don't think people use this argument too much anymore,"
09:55;09:57;"but that's like some old school, like--"
09:57;09:58;">> Hardcore."
09:58;10:00;">> --Maryland Manson [bleep] that's like--"
10:00;10:01;">> Yeah."
10:01;10:05;"We called our band Dick Pics because we do want to offend."
10:05;10:09;"We want to explore trauma, male aggressive sexuality."
10:09;10:11;"These are things that interest us."
10:11;10:16;"And while we may not be endorsing it, we do like to look at the dark side of life."
10:16;10:18;">> I'm singing in the character."
10:18;10:19;">> Right."
10:19;10:22;">> I'm actually a complete sweetheart, and I was bullied in high school."
10:22;10:23;">> Yeah."
10:23;10:29;">> And I deal with this by being a complete [bleep] on my albums."
10:29;10:31;">> I pay forward the trauma that I experienced."
11:00;11:01;">> It's one."
11:01;11:05;">> Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
11:05;11:07;">> Grateful Dead is about good vibes."
11:07;11:09;"It's about everybody feeling included."
11:09;11:13;"I mean, Grateful Dead concerts, I'm sure some horrible [bleep] went down,"
11:13;11:17;"and it really seemed to hurt them when they would hear about somebody getting hurt or something."
11:17;11:18;">> Right."
11:18;11:21;">> But Grateful Dead concerts, that was one of the original safe spaces, you know?"
11:21;11:27;"That was like people kind of turning their back on a repressive society with police violence,"
11:27;11:28;"racism, that kind of thing."
11:28;11:33;"So police violence, racism, that's--the Grateful Dead, that was supposed to be a safe space."
11:33;11:42;">> I was looking at an article today from 1991 in the New York Times that our producer Colin sent to me,"
11:42;11:49;"and the term ""safe space"" isn't used, but that concept is introduced by Jerry."
11:49;11:50;">> What did he say?"
11:50;11:54;">> Okay, so Jerry in this article from '91 is quoted,"
11:54;11:58;"""He once wrote that we're a real cheap vacation to Bermuda, which is kind of right,"
11:58;12:04;"but insofar as we're providing a safe context to be together with a lot of people who aren't afraid of each other,"
12:04;12:07;"which is real valuable in New York, I guess we're important."""
12:07;12:11;"He's basically like, ""Listen, some people are going to come straight from Wall Street,"
12:11;12:15;"wearing their suits, and come to the show, and some people are going to be stoned,"
12:15;12:19;"20-year-old kids wearing tie-dye shirts, and they're all going to feel at home there."
12:19;12:26;"They're all going to feel together, and the way the world is now, you know, scary 1991,"
12:26;12:31;"I'm glad that we can offer that space where everyone feels included together."""
12:31;12:33;">> That's a great vibe. Jerry wanted to have a safe space."
12:33;12:39;"I mean, Jerry probably never had to get into some of the thornier questions that the world's wrestling with now."
12:39;12:40;">> Nope."
12:40;12:41;">> Back then-"
12:41;12:43;">> I guess it always seems screwed up, doesn't it?"
12:43;12:45;">> The world is consistently screwed up."
12:45;12:49;">> It just always seems like the most extreme version of history."
12:49;12:52;">> Yeah, who knows? '91 even could have been worse in some ways."
12:52;12:53;">> Of course."
12:53;12:54;">> For a lot of people."
12:54;12:57;"Grateful Dead concerts are supposed to be a safe space. That's for sure."

15:48;15:51;"So we're gonna do a little dead block, because--"
15:51;15:53;"This is gonna be a very dead-intensive show, I think."
15:53;15:54;"This might be a dead-intensive show."
15:54;15:55;"So strap in."
15:55;15:57;"I hope there's nobody who listens to Time Crisis"
15:57;15:58;"and when we start talking about the dead,"
15:58;16:00;"is like, ""There they go again."""
16:00;16:01;"I feel like we provide context."
16:01;16:02;"I'm cool with that."
16:02;16:04;"I mean, you know, it's like,"
16:04;16:07;"you know, we talk about Home Depot, you know, dead, it's--"
16:07;16:09;"we try to find that kernel of general interest"
16:09;16:11;"within the specific."
16:11;16:13;"Corporate retail."
16:13;16:14;"[laughs]"
16:14;16:18;"So anyway, Jake, your email is the Time Crisis mailbag."
16:18;16:19;"It is."
16:19;16:21;"So you get so many great emails."
16:21;16:24;"Recently, you got one that was about the dead."
16:24;16:27;"This is Jake's personal and/or professional email."
16:27;16:29;"Yeah, I got a really long email."
16:29;16:30;"Great email."
16:30;16:32;"Can't read the whole thing,"
16:32;16:36;"'cause it was just a novella sent to us by Samantha Ross."
16:36;16:40;"Very detailed letter about her history with the dead."
16:40;16:43;"Basically, like, her parents were huge deadheads,"
16:43;16:45;"and she grew up in New York City,"
16:45;16:48;"and Samantha mentioned that her dad had a--"
16:48;16:49;"like, had this party trick"
16:49;16:52;"where he could nail the exact year,"
16:52;16:55;"sometimes even to the city and the date of any dead concert"
16:55;16:58;"just by hearing the first two minutes of the show."
16:58;17:00;"So this guy was, like, very tapped."
17:00;17:01;"That's unreal."
17:01;17:03;"Like, Tulsa, August '76."
17:03;17:06;"He's hearing Jack Straw, a song they played 700 times,"
17:06;17:08;"and he still just, like, in two minutes, he knows."
17:08;17:11;"Which is weird that they'd have that much variation"
17:11;17:13;"in their performance."
17:13;17:15;"That's what people like about the dead."
17:15;17:17;"So she goes on to explain her evolution"
17:17;17:19;"from someone who didn't care for the dead,"
17:19;17:22;"mostly due to her parents' love of them,"
17:22;17:24;"into someone fully appreciating their musicality"
17:24;17:27;"and how she's recently embraced them on her own terms"
17:27;17:29;"during a car ride this summer"
17:29;17:31;"after she downloaded the American Beauty record."
17:31;17:34;"That's a classic story about heritage."
17:34;17:37;"Yeah, like, your parents love it, so you kind of rebel."
17:37;17:38;"Right."
17:38;17:39;"And then you come around."
17:39;17:41;"Yeah, sometimes it takes life experience"
17:41;17:45;"to realize what the older generation saw in something."
17:45;17:47;"And I'm also interested in the fact--"
17:47;17:49;"it sounds like she grew up in New York City."
17:49;17:50;"Right."
17:50;17:53;"Famously on Live Dead, their first live album."
17:53;17:54;"'69."
17:54;17:56;"They're playing some of it at the Fillmore in New York,"
17:56;18:00;"and Jerry says, ""Man, coming to New York's always a trip, man."""
18:00;18:02;"[laughs]"
18:02;18:03;"Like..."
18:03;18:05;"Imagine Jerry just, like, in New York in '69."
18:05;18:08;"New York City must have been just so intense and weird."
18:08;18:10;"Obviously, there were hippies in New York."
18:10;18:12;"Who's hitting that Dead show in '69?"
18:12;18:15;"Is, like, Lou Reed going to that Dead show?"
18:15;18:19;"Or, like, the Velvets? Or, like, Andy Warhol?"
18:19;18:21;"No, I feel like at that point,"
18:21;18:24;"the Dead probably weren't, like, super cool."
18:24;18:27;"Andy Warhol's down at the factory."
18:27;18:30;"Edie Sedgwick and Lou Reed and Nico."
18:30;18:33;"It's like, ""What's going on tonight, guys?"""
18:33;18:37;"""Grateful Dead are playing at the Fillmore. You want to go?"""
18:37;18:38;"No."
18:38;18:39;"Of course not."
18:39;18:43;"I'm just trying to think of, like, some super, like, cool New York artsy people."
18:43;18:45;"Like, were they catching the Dead?"
18:45;18:46;"Patti Smith?"
18:46;18:48;"Patti Smith is probably still in high school."
18:48;18:50;"Was she going in to see the Dead?"
18:50;18:52;"My point is just that the Dead in New York City..."
18:52;18:54;"In '69, '70 is funny."
18:54;18:56;"...always been, like, a funny mix,"
18:56;18:59;"'cause New York City, as much as it is a..."
18:59;19:02;"produced a lot of, like, alternative culture,"
19:02;19:05;"it's also a hostile environment for hippiedom."
19:05;19:06;"For sure."
19:06;19:08;"Of course you get some left-wing people,"
19:08;19:11;"but I'm talking about the very specific New York version of hippiedom."
19:11;19:15;"To truly be that blissed-out hippie is difficult in New York."
19:15;19:20;"New York is cutting and ironic and judgmental and brutal."
19:20;19:21;"Yeah."
19:21;19:23;"Which is not the Dead vibe."
19:23;19:25;"And, you know, we've all seen it."
19:25;19:28;"You see some, like, random couple white hippies"
19:28;19:33;"wearing a peasant skirt, tie-dye, just, like, stoned in, like, a bodega at 2 a.m."
19:33;19:36;"You're just like, ""What? Do you live here? You live in, like, Park Slope?"""
19:36;19:37;"Yeah."
19:37;19:40;"♪ ♪"
20:28;20:36;"♪ ♪"
20:53;20:56;"♪ ♪"
21:21;21:23;"I just find it interesting to imagine, like,"
21:23;21:27;"and I have no idea how old Samantha is, the author of the letter,"
21:27;21:30;"but, like, you know, and I definitely knew some people like that"
21:30;21:33;"who, like, grew up in New York City, parents are kind of like old hippies,"
21:33;21:36;"but then, you know, if you're, like, growing up in the '90s,"
21:36;21:39;"it wasn't particularly cool to be, like, hippie-hippie."
21:39;21:42;"You're probably listening to, like, Wu-Tang."
21:42;21:44;"So, you know, if, like, you brought your--"
21:44;21:48;"I don't know, maybe you should, like, bring your friends back to parents'"
21:48;21:54;"pre-war apartment on the Upper West Side, blast into some early Method Man,"
21:54;21:56;"and then your dad's like, ""Hey, guys, I got a trick."
21:56;21:58;"Grab a tape from my Grateful Dead rack,"""
21:58;22:01;"you'd probably be like, ""Dad, nobody thinks that's cool."""
22:01;22:02;"-You'd push back. -Right."
22:02;22:05;"So she goes on here-- I'll quote from her now."
22:17;22:19;"-Oh, interesting. -I think Samantha's a little younger."
22:19;22:21;"-I think-- -Now I'm very curious about what era this was."
22:21;22:25;"I don't have her whole email printed here, but I believe she's, like, mid-20s,"
22:25;22:26;"if I recall."
22:26;22:28;"I guess it also depends on what school she was going to."
22:28;22:30;"New York's a big city."
22:30;22:32;"But it's funny to think about that being in,"
22:32;22:34;"because in my high school, it certainly was not in."
22:34;22:38;"It was at this point that some of my thoughts on the dead started to change."
22:38;22:42;"I did not like the fact that kids who had no knowledge about anything dead-related"
22:42;22:44;"wore their merchandise so regularly."
22:44;22:46;"So it just had become a fashion statement at that point."
22:46;22:47;"-Right. -Oh, okay."
22:47;22:50;"Samantha Ross is 19."
22:50;22:53;"-So she just finished high school-- -She was in high school a few years ago."
22:53;22:54;"-Very recently. -Okay, right. Got it."
22:54;22:56;"Like, last year."
22:56;22:58;"Even though I wasn't into their music,"
22:58;23:01;"this animosity towards non-Grateful Dead fans"
23:01;23:04;"that were simply just adhering to a popular fashion trend"
23:04;23:07;"made me realize that I was, in some ways, a fan of the dead."
23:07;23:09;"On the topic of banned T-shirts,"
23:09;23:11;"I was a counselor at a sleepaway camp this summer,"
23:11;23:14;"and even my 11-year-old campers had blondie,"
23:14;23:17;"Rolling Stones, and of course, Grateful Dead T-shirts."
23:17;23:20;"A popular shirt and sticker that many campers had read saying,"
23:20;23:22;"""Grateful to be at camp,"""
23:22;23:25;"with a bunch of bejeweled dancing bears surrounding it."
23:25;23:27;"It's interesting with the 11-year-olds wearing those shirts"
23:27;23:29;"because that's still a little bit young."
23:29;23:30;"Maybe with the Internet it's different."
23:30;23:34;"I feel like maybe I was 13 when I really started taking control"
23:34;23:36;"over what I wanted to wear."
23:36;23:38;"But I had a friend who once said to me,"
23:38;23:43;"""This is the first generation of kids whose parents want them to be cool."""
23:43;23:44;"Dark."
23:44;23:47;"But the point being that in the past,"
23:47;23:50;"even with the kind of baby boomer parents"
23:50;23:53;"who generally wanted to have positive relationships with their kids,"
23:53;23:55;"as opposed to some real old-school, like,"
23:55;23:57;"""World's hard, you're on your own, son."""
23:57;23:58;"Non-existent relationship."
23:58;24:02;"Yeah, but even then, the idea of wanting your kid to be cool,"
24:02;24:04;"you don't want them to be bullied or something,"
24:04;24:06;"but I'm sure it's going to be like that."
24:06;24:09;"We're the generation who's going to probably be a little more tuned in"
24:09;24:14;"and be like, you know, you want your kid to probably have a cool shirt."
24:14;24:17;"Or maybe in this late, late capitalist era,"
24:17;24:20;"we intuit that being cool is a way to make money."
24:20;24:25;"It's definitely a way that increases your odds of making a living."
24:25;24:28;"Imagine all these 11-year-olds whose parents got them"
24:28;24:30;"Blondie and Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead shirts."
24:30;24:32;"Do you think some of the parents are also sitting down with them"
24:32;24:34;"before they go to camp and they're just like,"

33:16;33:18;"Bob Weir, attracts OG Deadheads who have attended"
33:18;33:20;"countless shows since the 1970s."
33:20;33:22;"For them, Sunday night was a reunion of sorts,"
33:22;33:24;"and they pulled out gear from their collections"
33:24;33:26;"of bootleg T-shirts and custom jackets."
33:26;33:29;"But Dead & Co. also turns out a new generation of fans"
33:29;33:31;"who have been initiated into the culture."
33:31;33:34;"These kids have embraced a different side of the Deadhead DIY world"
33:34;33:38;"and rocked up in their rare T-shirts from the likes of W.O.B.F."
33:38;33:40;"and From the Lot. So these are the kids who are buying"
33:40;33:43;"these new Grateful Dead shirts that different people"
33:43;33:46;"are making DIY, like the people who are selling them at your show."
33:46;33:48;"- What are they running, like, 70 a shirt?"
33:48;33:50;"- It could be all over the place."
33:50;33:52;"So naturally, they sent Mordecai Rubinstein,"
33:52;33:55;"aka Mr. Mort, expert chronicler of subcultural style,"
33:55;33:57;"to hang out and snap the most epic tie-dye T-shirts"
33:57;34:00;"and steely patches that he could find throughout the day and night."
34:00;34:02;"So we got to talk to Mort. This is perfect for us."
34:02;34:05;"Friend of the show, was over at the Dead concert..."
34:05;34:07;"- What's getting in? - ...taking pictures."
34:07;34:11;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
34:11;34:14;"[phone ringing]"
34:14;34:17;"- Hello? - Morde, how you doing? It's Ezra."
34:17;34:19;"- Oh, wonderful. Thank you. How are you?"
34:19;34:21;"- It's great to hear your voice. You're on with me and Jake."
34:21;34:23;"I don't think you ever met my West Coast co-host, Jake Longstreth."
34:23;34:26;"Hey, Mort. - I don't believe so. Howdy."
34:26;34:28;"- So first of all, you're a friend of the show,"
34:28;34:31;"so it's great to hear your voice, even though you couldn't be in person."
34:31;34:33;"Also want to congratulate you."
34:33;34:35;"I know not too long ago you became a father."
34:35;34:37;"- Oh, yeah, seven weeks."
34:37;34:39;"- Has that affected your style at all?"
34:39;34:43;"- Well, I went from mocking dad style"
34:43;34:46;"to, I guess, being dad style."
34:46;34:49;"- Well, now nobody can accuse you of appropriating dad style."
34:49;34:54;"- Yeah, but it's really, like, cramping my style on this phone right now."
34:54;34:56;"I'm trying to whisper when the baby's sleeping."
34:56;34:58;"- Oh, 'cause you got a baby sleeping in your apartment?"
34:58;35:00;"Okay, understood."
35:00;35:02;"Well, the main thing we wanted to talk to you about is"
35:02;35:06;"you were photographing the Grateful Dead lot scene"
35:06;35:08;"at Madison Square Garden this past week."
35:08;35:10;"- Oh, yeah, definitely."
35:10;35:12;"- So how was it? - It was amazing."
35:12;35:16;"I've never been to a show with Jerry or without Jerry"
35:16;35:19;"or what's their new playboy leading the place, John Mayer."
35:19;35:21;"I've never been to a Dead & Co.,"
35:21;35:23;"never been to, like, a tribute band, none of that."
35:23;35:27;"So it was a pretty, pretty amazing far out experience."
35:27;35:31;"But if you have been or you've done some research like I have,"
35:31;35:33;"there's no shakedown street here."
35:33;35:36;"There's no lot styles. There's no lot."
35:36;35:38;"Madison Square Garden's--"
35:38;35:40;"you know, I don't think if you opened up a pillowcase"
35:40;35:44;"and tried selling socks, it'd last five minutes out there."
35:44;35:47;"So you had to really, like, you know, dig for it."
35:47;35:50;"You had to, like, really look for the sellers."
35:50;35:54;"And I say really dig and look, I mean, you know, Instagram, creep, you know,"
35:54;35:58;"which was pretty cool 'cause it made it, like, a lot harder to get."
35:58;36:00;"You know, people would see me wearing a T-shirt the second night"
36:00;36:02;"and be like, ""Where'd you get that?"""
36:02;36:04;"I bought it at the Steps at Penn Station."
36:04;36:07;"So you found a lot of people, even in New York City,"
36:07;36:10;"like you said, Madison Square Garden doesn't have some giant parking lot"
36:10;36:12;"like when you're going to catch a show somewhere else."
36:12;36:15;"So you found people just kind of, like, very quietly selling"
36:15;36:18;"their own bootleg Dead merch all over the general vicinity?"
36:18;36:23;"From Brooklyn to the subway station to the exit at Penn Station"
36:23;36:26;"to the bathroom stall inside Madison Square Garden."
36:26;36:27;"I acquired it all."
36:27;36:30;"People were selling bootleg merch in the bathroom?"
36:30;36:31;"Uh-huh, 100%."
36:31;36:33;"And what did you buy?"
36:33;36:34;"I'll tell you a couple things."
36:34;36:39;"I bought an amazing T-shirt with Lucy and Linus, Snoopy,"
36:39;36:41;"maybe that's the same person,"
36:41;36:44;"Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, some other little Bam Bam."
36:44;36:47;"I bought this beautiful tie-dye shirt made in Brooklyn."
36:47;36:48;"I like that."
36:48;36:51;"And I did a play on the word ""Terrapin"" at Penn Station,"
36:51;36:53;"the two N's, which I thought was cool."
36:53;36:54;"Strong."
36:54;36:55;"Witty."
36:55;36:57;"Yeah, I got myself the pink and green."
36:57;37:00;"I got my wife the blue and black and white,"
37:00;37:01;"knowing that she'd want mine."
37:01;37:04;"But I was nice where I actually got two."
37:04;37:06;"Normally I'm cheap and I just get one and say, ""Well, share it."""
37:06;37:08;"I got a couple T-shirts."
37:08;37:09;"I gave away Yamaka."
37:09;37:10;"I got a pin."
37:10;37:11;"I got a couple stickers."
37:11;37:12;"It was a Grateful Dead Yamaka?"
37:12;37:13;"Oh, yeah."
37:13;37:16;"What, it just had a skull on it or something?"
37:16;37:20;"It had a ""Steal Your Face,"" I think that's the classic kind of thing"
37:20;37:22;"with the thing going through it."
37:22;37:23;"Yeah, the logo."
37:23;37:25;"It's funny because I couldn't tell you one song,"
37:25;37:27;"but I can tell you almost every graphic."
37:27;37:29;"Well, so I also want to ask that, too."
37:29;37:30;"Okay, let's get into it."
37:30;37:32;"So, Morris, we--"
37:32;37:33;"I'm going to cut you off."
37:33;37:37;"I went to San Francisco a couple years ago for what I thought was going to be a couple days."
37:37;37:38;"Next thing you know, they're moving me there,"
37:38;37:41;"the corporate life, corporate housing, everything's fun and nice."
37:41;37:44;"My wife--my girlfriend at the time was like, ""Where are you going?"""
37:44;37:46;"I'm like, ""Man, I need to go take this trip for a little while."""
37:46;37:49;"You know, they're going to build an office for me back in New York."
37:49;37:51;"I stayed two years in San Francisco."
37:51;37:53;"One of my first days, I went to Haight-Ashbury."
37:53;37:57;"I knew I wasn't getting no original Grateful Dead T-shirt,"
37:57;37:59;"but I wanted what they want the tourists to have"
37:59;38:02;"because that's all that's available for under $300, $400 back then."
38:02;38:04;"Did you get that gap there?"
38:04;38:06;"Was that where it was originally a gap?"
38:06;38:08;"No, there's a gap at Haight-Ashbury now."
38:08;38:09;"Is it the first one?"
38:09;38:10;"No."
38:10;38:11;"Oh."
38:11;38:12;"It's just deeply like--"
38:12;38:13;"Right, Haight-Ashbury is--"
38:13;38:14;"--a jean store."
38:14;38:15;"I mean, you know."
38:15;38:16;"It's not really true hippie anymore."
38:16;38:17;"Yeah, right."
38:17;38:19;"The smell of weed is really just an incense stick,"
38:19;38:21;"but I bought some tees and I came back to New York,"
38:21;38:24;"and my wife tells me, ""Take those off."""
38:24;38:27;"I'm like, ""What do you mean? These are my Grateful Dead tees."""
38:27;38:30;"She said, ""Get a haircut and take that fake [bleep] off."""
38:30;38:32;"I took it off, but I didn't throw it away."
38:32;38:34;"Not the haircut, the T-shirts."
38:34;38:36;"A few years later--"
38:36;38:38;"Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down."
38:38;38:41;"You went to San Francisco for work."
38:41;38:44;"You're not a fan of the Grateful Dead, but you love menswear."
38:44;38:46;"No, you can't name one song."
38:46;38:47;"You can't name one song."
38:47;38:49;"[singing]"
38:49;38:51;"Okay, close enough."
38:51;38:54;"This is before Grateful Dead shirts came back into fashion."
38:54;38:55;"Oh, yeah."
38:55;38:57;"This is when John Mayer was probably doing that other song."
38:57;39:00;"So you go to Haight-Ashbury, and you always like to get"
39:00;39:03;"whatever the local tourist gear is, so you buy these Dead shirts."
39:03;39:05;"You go back to New York, and your wife says, ""Throw it out."""
39:05;39:07;"Why? Because she--"
39:07;39:09;"Because she has one from when she was 14,"
39:09;39:11;"when she thought she was a real hippie."
39:11;39:13;"Ah, so she's a real deadhead."
39:13;39:14;"So she thought you were a poser."
39:14;39:17;"Yes, and I was, and I really was."
39:17;39:19;"I wore the Patagonia. I wore the tie-dye."
39:19;39:22;"I grew my hair, grew the beard, because all the menswear people"
39:22;39:25;"were starting to wear fedoras and bow ties,"
39:25;39:27;"and that's where I was coming from, and I'm like, ""F--- that."""
39:27;39:29;"Okay, so we're talking like 10 years ago."
39:29;39:30;"Yep."
39:30;39:31;"Bow ties?"
39:31;39:32;"Yeah, that's what was happening."
39:32;39:34;"Was that like a Mumford and Sons reference?"
39:34;39:35;"It was a little Mumford."
39:35;39:37;"This is like--you're talking about the era in New York"
39:37;39:40;"where everybody was into old-timey stuff."
39:40;39:41;"Yeah."
39:41;39:43;"So you were ahead of your time in terms of menswear,"
39:43;39:46;"because you were getting into this kind of Grateful Dead T-shirt hippie vibe"
39:46;39:48;"when a lot of guys were being very uptight,"
39:48;39:51;"getting the Nazi haircut and the bow tie."
39:51;39:53;"So maybe in the professional environment,"
39:53;39:55;"you're doing something different, but on the home front,"
39:55;39:58;"now you got your girlfriend, who went on to become"
39:58;40:01;"the mother of your child, thinks you're a poser."
40:01;40:02;"Oh, she knows."
40:02;40:04;"Did she try to break up with you?"
40:04;40:05;"Why did she stay with you?"
40:05;40:07;"Because she's smart, you know?"
40:07;40:08;"She knows that it's all fun and games."
40:08;40:10;"It's Halloween every day."
40:10;40:11;"She knows Mordecai from Puerto."
40:11;40:13;"She knows I live for a costume."
40:13;40:16;"I live to, like, be zig-zag."
40:16;40:18;"But so did it hurt your feelings that you come home"
40:18;40:20;"and your wife is calling you a poser?"
40:20;40:21;"Big time."
40:21;40:22;"No, I took the shirts."
40:22;40:24;"I literally put them on bottom to bottom to bottom of the dresser,"
40:24;40:26;"and then three years later, I go to Beacon's Closet,"
40:26;40:27;"they don't even want to buy them."
40:27;40:28;"Whoa."
40:28;40:29;"Yeah, fast forward."
40:29;40:30;"Bottom of the market."
40:30;40:32;"Did she try to turn you on to the dead?"
40:32;40:34;"No, not once, which I also really appreciate,"
40:34;40:38;"because a lot of the people that have, I would never talk to them again."
40:38;40:40;"You know, they play the [bleep] for you on a car ride."
40:40;40:42;"It's a six-hour car ride, and they play great for that."
40:42;40:45;"I want to pull over after the first 30 seconds and hitchhike."
40:45;40:49;"I'm not a big hip-hop disc guy, the other, but that [bleep] is killing me."
40:49;40:52;"Now I really want to hear a banjo mandolin, you know?"
40:52;40:53;"No, I don't know."
40:53;40:55;"So, wait, so this is--"
40:55;40:57;"And what do you want to hear, Kanye?"
40:57;40:58;"No."
40:58;40:59;"Okay, wait, so Mordecai,"
40:59;41:02;"how come you like the music now, but you didn't like it before?"
41:02;41:03;"It's a really good question."
41:03;41:05;"You know, people are asking me, ""What did you think of the show?"""
41:05;41:06;"And I'm getting these responses."
41:06;41:08;"You know, the first set was a heater."
41:08;41:10;"Took them a couple songs to get it tight."
41:10;41:11;"""Cold Rain"" is one of my top ten."
41:11;41:12;"It crushed me."
41:12;41:14;"You know, ""Weird Jazz."""
41:14;41:17;"You know, oh, their language is so cool,"
41:17;41:20;"how they use the words ""soft"" and ""fragile."""
41:20;41:21;"You know, I like that."
41:21;41:23;"And I like music that takes me places."
41:23;41:26;"I'm a hustling guy from Brooklyn Crown Heights, you know?"
41:26;41:29;"When I hear a banjo, I think I'm at a bluegrass festival"
41:29;41:31;"with a bunch of cool hippies that I didn't grow up with."
41:31;41:33;"We all want what we didn't have, I think, anyway."
41:33;41:35;"So I like that kind of stuff."
41:35;41:38;"So in a way, your interest in the T-shirts"
41:38;41:40;"came before your interest in the music,"
41:40;41:41;"and you have no shame in that."
41:41;41:43;"Oh, no way at all."
41:43;41:45;"No shame at all, and not in a way."
41:45;41:46;"In the way."
41:46;41:48;"So you're actually happy it panned out that way."
41:48;41:49;"Oh, yeah, man."
41:49;41:51;"I mean, I went to Petaluma."
41:51;41:54;"I went to all the crazy places from San Francisco"
41:54;41:56;"all the way to Napa and all the places in between."
41:56;41:58;"I went to every single flea market there."
41:58;42:00;"If a guy didn't wash the shirt for 30 years"
42:00;42:01;"since his last dead show,"
42:01;42:04;"I'd pay 10 times the price that he wanted to just for it."
42:04;42:05;"People don't understand."
42:05;42:07;"You can just go buy a new liquid blue shirt"
42:07;42:11;"or a new M65 without having the blood, sweat, and tears"
42:11;42:12;"that went through it."
42:12;42:13;"That s--t is priceless."
42:13;42:15;"Well, that's something I've always noticed about you"
42:15;42:16;"is that you respect--"
42:16;42:19;"whether or not you like the culture,"
42:19;42:23;"you respect the people whose clothes reflect their life."
42:23;42:24;"This is true."
42:24;42:26;"I mean, these clothing tell stories."
42:26;42:27;"So you bought some cool gear there,"
42:27;42:29;"but what about just the general fashion"
42:29;42:30;"of the people at the show?"
42:30;42:31;"Were you impressed?"
42:31;42:33;"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
42:33;42:34;"I was so unimpressed."
42:34;42:37;"You know, GQ was smart to have me shoot it,"
42:37;42:38;"but they had me shoot outside."
42:38;42:40;"Inside, you know, I don't really take pictures inside,"
42:40;42:41;"but I did a little bit of that."
42:41;42:42;"I did a lot of exploring."
42:42;42:43;"I ran around."
42:43;42:45;"I went the second night, too."
42:45;42:48;"And there's so many Yeezys and stuff"
42:48;42:49;"and not as many Birkenstocks,"
42:49;42:52;"which kills me because I spent the whole show"
42:52;42:55;"both shows just trying to see Bob Weir, Bob Weir,"
42:55;42:58;"just to see if he was wearing socks with his Birkenstocks."
42:58;42:59;"And I was pretty close,"
42:59;43:02;"and I couldn't get a good view of Weir,"
43:02;43:04;"but I understand-- the first night I saw--"
43:04;43:05;"So you don't think it's not cool"
43:05;43:08;"for a young guy to wear Yeezys to the Dead show?"
43:08;43:09;"Isn't that best of both worlds?"
43:09;43:10;"No, it's not."
43:10;43:13;"What do you want to see from somebody's fashion"
43:13;43:15;"at a Dead & Company show in 2017?"
43:15;43:18;"I want to see a Birkenstock taken to the St. Mark's"
43:18;43:20;"and put on a 7-inch sole"
43:20;43:23;"if they want to do something modern to it, you know?"
43:23;43:26;"I want to see people take the Balenciaga Crocs"
43:26;43:27;"and wear those."
43:27;43:28;"I want comfort, you know?"
43:28;43:30;"The Yeezy's, that [bleep] is not comfortable."
43:30;43:31;"Or maybe it is."
43:31;43:32;"I never really tried them on."
43:32;43:33;"But it's funny."
43:33;43:35;"These kids-- you know, I met a kid on Instagram."
43:35;43:36;"I met a kid."
43:36;43:37;"This is a real story."
43:37;43:38;"He's, like, 21."
43:38;43:40;"He buys and sells Palace and Supreme"
43:40;43:42;"just to support his Dead habits."
43:42;43:43;"And he's one of the biggest dealers"
43:43;43:45;"of, like, vintage Grateful Dead."
43:45;43:46;"I will not drop his name."
43:46;43:48;"Okay, no, but I've followed some of these guys,"
43:48;43:50;"these kind of Instagram Dead guys."
43:50;43:52;"Yeah, it seems like there's this weird intersection"
43:52;43:53;"of old Grateful Dead T-shirts"
43:53;43:55;"but also, like, new Supreme stuff."
43:55;43:56;"Yeah."
43:56;43:57;"Did you see any of these--"
43:57;43:59;"we were just reading this old jury quote"
43:59;44:01;"about how at a Grateful Dead show,"
44:01;44:02;"back in the day, you'd be getting"
44:02;44:05;"everybody from Wall Street guys to young hippies."
44:05;44:08;"Did you see any guys straight from the office"
44:08;44:10;"wearing their uptight corporate style?"
44:10;44:11;"Yes, I'd like to see that quote"
44:11;44:13;"because there was tons of that."
44:13;44:15;"Tons and tons and tons of the retro acts"
44:15;44:17;"over a button-up with khakis."
44:17;44:19;"Tons on Tuesday."

44:20;44:21;"I was blown away."
44:21;44:23;"Do you think that's a respectable look,"
44:23;44:25;"like the corporate lawyer who takes off"
44:25;44:27;"a little early to go catch the Dead in Kosho?"
44:27;44:28;"It is and it isn't."
44:28;44:30;"It is because he's coming straight from work"
44:30;44:32;"and you gotta appreciate a guy that did that"
44:32;44:33;"and not a clown like me that took three days"
44:33;44:35;"to get dressed, you know?"
44:35;44:36;"Like, this guy's--"
44:36;44:37;"don't go and see something he loved"
44:37;44:38;"and grew up with and doesn't care"
44:38;44:39;"what he looks like."
44:39;44:41;"He's not gonna put on a costume, you know?"
44:41;44:42;"And there's me that couldn't tell you one song"
44:42;44:44;"and I did everything except for put on makeup,"
44:44;44:45;"you know?"
44:45;44:46;"All right, well, at least you're keeping it real."
44:46;44:49;"Well, so, Morga, I love talking to you always"
44:49;44:50;"and I love hearing your take on the Dead"
44:50;44:51;"and the show."
44:51;44:53;"I'd be remiss not to ask you,"
44:53;44:55;"as one of the preeminent chroniclers"
44:55;44:58;"of style of our time,"
44:58;44:59;"if Grateful Dead shirts have kind of come"
44:59;45:01;"into fashion in the past few years,"
45:01;45:03;"what's coming back next?"
45:03;45:05;"All I can think about is John Mayer's cropped"
45:05;45:07;"T-shirt on Sunday."
45:07;45:08;"That's all I can think about."
45:08;45:10;"It was, like, so perfectly cropped."
45:10;45:12;"And I can't make fun 'cause he's a rock star,"
45:12;45:14;"but if you wore that on the street"
45:14;45:15;"while you are a rock star,"
45:15;45:17;"that's s*** for the stage."
45:17;45:19;"So if that guy can wear that on stage,"
45:19;45:20;"what's gonna stop some kids--"
45:20;45:21;"Wait, wait, I don't understand."
45:21;45:22;"'Cause he--"
45:22;45:23;"What's a cropped T-shirt?"
45:23;45:24;"Like, he was showing his belly?"
45:24;45:25;"Oh, midriffed?"
45:25;45:26;"This shirt that John was wearing"
45:26;45:28;"was either capital or vismin,"
45:28;45:32;"and the back was just, just higher than the front."
45:32;45:33;"It wasn't showing the belly."
45:33;45:36;"It wasn't showing, like, a tramp stamp kind of thing."
45:36;45:38;"It could have been his guitar that was doing it,"
45:38;45:40;"but it's bulls*** it wasn't his guitar that was doing it."
45:40;45:42;"It was cropped just so."
45:42;45:43;"So you were seeing too much of his lower back"
45:43;45:44;"for your taste?"
45:44;45:45;"You didn't like it?"
45:45;45:46;"'Cause it kind of seems to me--"
45:46;45:47;"I keep seeing more and more"
45:47;45:49;"John Mayer's becoming a style icon."
45:49;45:50;"I see people be like,"
45:50;45:53;"""You know, John Mayer buys expensive sneakers."""
45:53;45:56;"You know, I'd rather talk about his style"
45:56;45:58;"than Sheila Booth's fake non-style."
45:58;45:59;"[laughs]"
45:59;46:00;"Tell me about your Lithuania tee."
46:00;46:01;"Do you know what year it's from?"
46:01;46:03;"Oh, my Lithuania tee?"
46:03;46:04;"I think it's from '94."
46:04;46:05;"Where did you buy it?"
46:05;46:08;"On Etsy, from Dead Shaman Supply."
46:08;46:10;"You think my Lithuania tee's fake?"
46:10;46:12;"He sells a lot of repros."
46:12;46:13;"He doesn't sell all repros."
46:13;46:14;"But he sells a lot of repros."
46:14;46:15;"But don't you feel like--"
46:15;46:16;"Who cares if it's a repro?"
46:16;46:17;"You know, like, at a certain--"
46:17;46:19;"If you're talking about authenticity--"
46:19;46:20;"Oh, I do. I do."
46:20;46:22;"That's why my wife made me throw out all the tee shirts."
46:22;46:24;"But this--it's a big problem with the repros."
46:24;46:26;"Because if you look at Liquid Blue,"
46:26;46:29;"anything after '95 is trash."
46:29;46:31;"It looks like they took screenshots of the tee shirt"
46:31;46:33;"and made the screenshot a tee shirt."
46:33;46:36;"And if you look at, like, this kid Deadhead's Instagram,"
46:36;46:37;"you'll see the difference."
46:37;46:38;"I know his Instagram."
46:38;46:39;"Yeah."
46:39;46:40;"I mean, I don't want to shout anybody out,"
46:40;46:42;"but it's just, like, really,"
46:42;46:45;"really interesting, the whole Lithuania thing, you know?"
46:45;46:46;"Look, I agree with you."
46:46;46:48;"It's cooler just to be--"
46:48;46:50;"have an old tee shirt."
46:50;46:51;"But if you want to get a tee shirt,"
46:51;46:54;"I don't know, dropping 400 is not cool in my book."
46:54;46:56;"No, and also, I know a lot of guys,"
46:56;46:59;"maybe you included, I don't know this much about you,"
46:59;47:01;"a lot of guys I know, they don't want the snow."
47:01;47:04;"They don't want the holes in the tee shirt, you know?"
47:04;47:06;"So, fine, buy something new."
47:06;47:08;"Better that than Jerry Lorenzo, you know,"
47:08;47:10;"fear of God, you know, pre-A*."
47:10;47:13;"But the problem is the double RL and the pre-A* stuff,"
47:13;47:15;"it's like it looks just so fake."
47:15;47:19;"But getting a good liquid blue on heat ashford for 25 bucks,"
47:19;47:21;"you know, or your Lithuania tee,"
47:21;47:22;"if you don't know it's real or not,"
47:22;47:24;"I don't mind that, but if it comes with fake holes,"
47:24;47:25;"that's a problem."
47:25;47:26;"I got you."
47:26;47:29;"All right, well, Mordecai, a pleasure as always talking to you."
47:29;47:31;"Yeah, next we'll talk about what's next."
47:31;47:33;"Next we'll talk about-- I can tell--"
47:33;47:35;"okay, I understand, you don't want to give away all your secrets."
47:35;47:37;"No, 'cause I know Levi's and Gap and all the hot brands,"
47:37;47:39;"you know, they listen to this show."
47:39;47:41;"Urban Outfitters, you know, we can't keep it all."
47:41;47:43;"Okay, well, we'll talk to you soon."
47:43;47:44;"Thanks for calling in, dude."
47:44;47:45;"Thank you so much for having me."
47:45;47:46;"Have a great night."
47:46;47:47;"Bye."
49:55;50:06;"That was Mordecai Rubenstein, Mr. Mort."
50:06;50:09;"Always a pleasure to have on the show talking about fashion."
50:09;50:11;"So, Jake, you were having a hard time wrapping your head around"
50:11;50:14;"the fact that this dude cannot name one Grateful Dead song."
50:14;50:17;"It's just such a different world view"
50:17;50:23;"to, like, be so into, like, just the T-shirt stand of the band"
50:23;50:26;"but not give a rat's ass about the tunes."
50:26;50:31;"And actually, even maybe he expressed, like, disdain for the music."
50:31;50:34;"Well, he said he didn't like when people were, like, forcing it on him, I guess."
50:34;50:35;"But, you know--"
50:35;50:38;"So, it's like, I'm not going to wear, like, an insane clown posse T-shirt."
50:38;50:40;"Because you're not a big enough fan?"
50:40;50:41;"You'd feel like a poser?"
50:41;50:44;"Yeah, well, and I actively think that music is terrible."
50:44;50:46;"You think ICP is terrible?"
50:46;50:47;"I do."
50:47;50:50;"ICP is cool now. Be careful, Jake."
50:50;50:52;"It's like a class issue now."
50:52;50:57;"Okay, but you could tell that Mordecai is passionate about the culture."
50:57;50:59;"You know, his way in is just-- is through the clothes."
50:59;51:01;"Your way in is through the music."
51:01;51:03;"That's fair."
51:03;51:05;"It's very extreme."
51:05;51:08;"Like, if you're going to wear all this gear, buy all this gear of this band,"
51:08;51:11;"you think you might do, like, a little legwork."
51:11;51:13;"I don't care. It's fine."
51:13;51:15;"It's just, like, a funny relationship to have."
51:15;51:16;"Well, I'll tell you something."
51:16;51:18;"As the president of an LLC--"
51:18;51:19;"Yeah?"
51:19;51:21;"--and a member of a band,"
51:21;51:25;"somebody who listens to your album a hundred times"
51:25;51:29;"on the free tier of a streaming service"
51:29;51:35;"is putting less bread in your pocket than one poser who buys a T-shirt."
51:35;51:36;"Fair point."
51:36;51:38;"So I say, thank you to the posers."
51:38;51:41;"I don't think there's a lot of posers buying Vampire Weekend T-shirts."
51:41;51:44;"I think people only buy Vampire Weekend gear if they like Vampire Weekend."
51:44;51:45;"If they're heads."
51:45;51:47;"If they're heads. Maybe in ten years."
51:47;51:49;"That'd be nice."
51:49;51:52;"You have to raise your T-shirt game on the next tour."
51:52;51:53;"You want to design one, Jake?"
51:53;51:54;"Yeah, I should probably help you out with that."
51:54;51:56;"Yeah."
51:56;51:57;"I'd love to see a Jake original."
51:57;51:58;"I'd love to."
51:58;51:59;"That'd be cool."
51:59;52:02;"Merch is a very big business now."
52:02;52:03;"Sure."
52:03;52:06;"Now people are doing pop-up stores, people are starting their own fashion lines."
52:06;52:09;"And here I have been, like a chump,"
52:09;52:11;"sitting on the sidelines"
52:11;52:13;"talking about Home Depot,"
52:13;52:14;"making cartoons,"
52:14;52:16;"and sitting on my ass in the studio."
52:16;52:18;"I missed a g***** damn gold rush."
52:18;52:19;"Kanye and Justin Bieber."
52:19;52:21;"You think it's different now than it was a few years ago?"
52:21;52:22;"Oh yeah."
52:22;52:23;"Wow."
52:23;52:24;"We missed a g***** damn gold rush."
52:24;52:26;"Well get on that right now, dude."
52:26;52:28;"We could do something where we do like,"
52:28;52:30;"even before the album comes out,"
52:30;52:32;"we do limit, you know what a drop is?"
52:32;52:34;"Yeah, can an album drop?"
52:34;52:35;"Or like, no, but in like, clothes."
52:35;52:36;"No."
52:36;52:39;"It would roughly refer to some sort of situation"
52:39;52:41;"in which you're like,"
52:41;52:43;"it could be at a pop-up shop"
52:43;52:44;"where you're quickly selling a bunch of merch."
52:44;52:45;"It could be at a flea market,"
52:45;52:46;"it could be just pull up,"
52:46;52:48;"you know, I'll post on Instagram,"
52:48;52:51;"""Me and Jake got 100 hand-painted VW t-shirts."""
52:51;52:52;"Ooh."
52:52;52:54;"""Bring $100 cash"
52:54;52:56;"and meet us in a Home Depot parking lot."
52:56;52:58;"We're gonna get a good lot scene going."""
52:58;52:59;"I like this."
52:59;53:01;"That really would tie everything together."
53:01;53:02;"This should be--"
53:02;53:03;"A Home Depot lot scene."
53:03;53:06;"Home Depot management would be so confused."
53:06;53:07;"Yeah."
53:07;53:09;"Just--"
53:09;53:12;"Honestly, it'd be great for them."
53:12;53:13;"Would it?"
53:13;53:15;"Yeah, 'cause maybe a kid comes through"
53:15;53:17;"to check out the drop,"
53:17;53:22;"buys some limited edition VW X Jake Longstreth merch,"
53:22;53:24;"and then afterwards, maybe they're thirsty,"
53:24;53:25;"they want a soda,"
53:25;53:27;"going to Home Depot to grab a soda."
53:27;53:29;"Maybe they start looking around and say like,"
53:29;53:30;"""Oh, you know what, actually?"
53:30;53:33;"I've been meaning to refinish my deck."""
53:33;53:35;"It's Father's Day."
53:35;53:36;"Right?"
53:36;53:38;"I'm gonna pick up the Makita Impact Driver."
53:38;53:40;"For Dad."
53:40;53:41;"He's gonna love it."
53:41;53:44;"Okay, Jake, I want you on my merch team"

01:01:06;01:01:09;"which they played on January 7, 1979."

01:01:11;01:01:13;"You really-- all the musicians out there,"

01:01:14;01:01:16;"Yeah, it took 'em 14 years to get there."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Yeah, the dead started in the mid-'60s."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"There's no way they were playing to that many people in New York."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And then 1979, like the height of ""New Wave,"" ""Disco."""
01:01:24;01:01:26;"They don't have a big album out."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"They're very unfashionable,"

01:01:29;01:01:30;"It's amazing."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"So they played 52 times in total at MSG."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"Phish will play their 53rd concert at MSG"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"on December 28, 2017,"

01:01:45;01:01:46;"I know it."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"You know it. It's your boy."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"It's Billy Joel."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Yeah."
01:01:49;01:01:52;"Yeah, because, you know, 'cause you can see at the Garden,"

01:01:54;01:01:56;"Oh, really? It's like--"

01:01:58;01:01:59;"Yeah, literally."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"It says, like, the Knicks and the Rangers"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"and all the championship sports teams,"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"and it says Billy Joel, most concerts played at MSG."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I caught him there once."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I know you did."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"You texted me the set list."

01:02:13;01:02:14;"Good Lord."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"What about number two?"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Elton John."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"You got it. '64."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"His name is also up in the rafters."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Maybe he played the most consecutive shows or something."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"It's Billy Joel and Elton John are the two musicians"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"up there next to the Knicks and the Rangers."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"What blows my mind is that the Dead,"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"going back to that 1991 New York Times article,"
01:02:31;01:02:36;"played nine straight nights at MSG in '91."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"Yeah."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"That is just, like--I don't know what to make of it."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"It's just so surreal. Hard to picture."

01:02:53;01:02:56;"One in '92, you know, in there in '93."
01:02:56;01:02:59;"Oh, you're right. That was election year."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"We're a full two years out from Clinton, bro."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"We're like deep George H.W."

01:03:05;01:03:07;"Not really, dude."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Oh, yeah, you're right, 'cause the election was '92,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"and he didn't take the office till '93."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Yeah, he didn't really come on the scene till '92."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Okay, you're right, those weird H.W. years."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"Anyway, it's 1979 versus 2017."
01:03:19;01:03:23;"I think you're gonna like this 1979 top 5, Jake,"

01:25:45;01:25:46;"This is called ""Walk on Water."""
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Look at that first lyric, ""I walk on water."""

01:26:29;01:26:33;"Knowing that no matter what bars I come with, you're gonna harp gripe,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"and that's a hard fight getting to swallow."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"I feel the ice cracking because--"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"Wait, wait, what the hell is he talking about?"
01:26:44;01:26:48;"Okay, well, so you know, there's an interesting podcast that Rick Rubin started,"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"a new podcast where they talk about the songs."
01:26:51;01:26:55;"I listened to it, so I have some more info to contextualize the song."
01:26:55;01:27:02;"Apparently the song is about Eminem feeling like for all of his success,"
01:27:02;01:27:07;"he's kind of painted himself into a corner because when you get to your 7th or 8th album,"
01:27:07;01:27:12;"you've explored so much territory that in some ways you've kind of done it all."
01:27:12;01:27:16;"And now every move you make is like a high-wire act where it's like"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"you can't please everybody anymore."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Eminem's shown his serious side. He's shown his silly side."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"He says, ""Some people hear a new song from me and they say,"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"'Oh, how come he's not doing that old-school hip-hop?'"""
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Or they hear some old-school sh*t and it's like,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"""How come he's not keeping up with the times?"""
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Or, ""Why is he being all whiny and serious?"""
01:27:31;01:27:38;"So I think the song is about him reckoning with his place in culture"
01:27:38;01:27:43;"and the difficulty of being a very successful artist with a lot of pressure on you."
01:27:43;01:27:49;"You can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"That's right."
01:27:50;01:27:53;"So I think he's saying, ""Why are expectations so high?"""
01:27:53;01:27:56;"He said it's almost like he's a victim of his own success."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"Alright, well that's not interesting at all."
01:27:59;01:28:03;"You're not interested in Eminem's struggles with his self and his artists?"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Not in that respect."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"One thing that I want to know is what does he mean when he says,"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"""As pressure increases like khakis""?"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Yeah, I don't know what that means."

01:28:15;01:28:17;"Oh, okay."

01:28:23;01:28:26;"You know, that's one of those things where it's either super smart or super dumb."

01:28:28;01:28:29;"I'm probably guilty of this too."
01:28:29;01:28:34;"Wordplay can either be this sublime thing where something has multiple meanings"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"and you found a way to use language in a fun way,"

01:29:04;01:29:06;"Like in public and paper?"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Yeah."

01:29:49;01:29:50;"Oh, really? You like it?"
01:29:50;01:29:56;"Yeah, it's more specific to his actual day-to-day struggle of being an artist."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Right, now you understand what he's talking about."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Probably should not have dropped the R-word."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"I guess that's just old Grandpa Eminem."
01:30:01;01:30:02;"Yeah."

01:30:22;01:30:25;"One thing I like about Eminem, too, and I encourage everybody to listen to that podcast"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"because if you're remotely interested in him--"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"I got to check it out."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"At least you get some weird insight."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"And you can tell, this is a dude--one thing I'll say,"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"from everything I've ever heard about him, read about him,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"in his own words, other people's words,"
01:30:36;01:30:43;"he truly is a super intense, hard-on-himself perfectionist"
01:30:43;01:30:48;"versus, say, a kid rock who seems just like a showboat and ego-driven dude."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"Eminem seems like a genuinely tormented dude"
01:30:51;01:30:57;"who really wants to be great, really cares about craft."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"And we could listen to this song and maybe we don't like it that much or whatever,"
01:31:00;01:31:06;"but Eminem truly is a dude who's all day long thinking about his lyrics"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"and working at them."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"He's like Leonard Cohen."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"He is like Leonard Cohen."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"And kid rock is like Kiss."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Yeah, exactly."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Eminem is gravitas."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"He's hard on himself."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"And there's an interesting part where he talks about how"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"when he was a kid growing up listening to Tupac,"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"he had this epiphany where he realized--he was saying,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"""Why is Tupac so good?"""
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Because some people listen to Tupac, they just love it,"

01:31:34;01:31:35;"""What makes this good?"""
01:31:35;01:31:39;"And Eminem's big insight with Tupac was he said Tupac's lyrics"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"moved with the chord progression."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"It wasn't just like he picked a set of words to say"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"and then put them over the beat."
01:31:46;01:31:51;"He would make sure that certain lines corresponded with the emotional part"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"of the chord progression."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"So if it hit a chord that was minor, he would make sure that that's where"
01:31:56;01:31:59;"he was saying something dark or something that fit with it."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"And Eminem realized there was kind of a--almost like a Jerry Garcia-esque"
01:32:02;01:32:08;"lyricism in the way that he was matching words to the chord progression."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"And Eminem realized that's something that he wanted to do."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"And it's not something that every rapper does."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"Whether or not you like Eminem, that's a guy who's thinking."

01:32:30;01:32:32;"Is he just all in his head?"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"And then he makes this kind of emotional song,"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"and then at the very last minute, he snaps out of it."

01:34:45;01:34:48;"According to Billboard, the song is about sex."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"Oh, okay."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"All the way."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Okay."
01:35:22;01:35:26;"This is the drop of '79."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"Yeah."
01:35:29;01:35:32;"This is like a famous long note she held."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"That was a long note."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"Yeah."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"I've never heard this before, have you?"
01:35:43;01:35:44;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"Well--"
01:35:48;01:35:51;"And she wrote this song herself."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"She didn't write a lot of her hits."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"This is the one."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"Gotcha."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"Amazing voice."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"Dim all the lights."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"All of the lights."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"Dim all the lights."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"It's time to have sex."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"Just dim 'em."
01:36:30;01:36:33;"Throw, like, a t-shirt over the bedside lamp."
01:36:33;01:36:38;"Yeah, back in 1979, you couldn't be controlling the lights from an app on your phone."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Right."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"They had dimmers, though."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"Did they have a lot of dimmers in 1979?"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Probably not a standard issue item."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"No, I think that's when you'd hear all these stories."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"I feel like--"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Well, then, what she's saying, ""Dim all the lights."""
01:36:50;01:36:52;"I mean, what does she mean, though?"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"In her--"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"No, I think back then--"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"In her Barbra Streisand mansion in Malibu?"
01:36:56;01:36:57;"I think in the late '70s."
01:36:57;01:37:04;"This is that kind of weird, just, like, useless stuff that you vaguely pick up, like, when you're, like, a kid from, like, a couple eras after something."
01:37:04;01:37:11;"It's, like, 1994, and I'm just, like, on, like, a Saturday just watching some episode of, like, some weird sitcom from 1979."
01:37:11;01:37:17;"I'm just like, I feel like back then, you're right, people would throw a t-shirt on the lamp, and then sometimes it'd burn the house down."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Still do."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"Still?"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:37:20;01:37:24;"I feel like I watched some sitcom when I was a kid where they were, like, somebody tried to do something sexy."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"I think also--"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"I don't leave the t-shirt on there."
01:37:26;01:37:29;"I think people would also sometimes vaguely unscrew the bulb."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"Wasn't that a move?"
01:37:30;01:37:31;"Oh, really?"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"From back in the day?"
01:37:32;01:37:35;"If you unscrewed the bulb, like, halfway, it would be a little dim."
01:37:35;01:37:38;"I'm getting a message here."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Yeah?"
01:37:39;01:37:56;"In 1959, Joel Spira, who had found the Lutron Electronics Company in '61, invented a dimmer based on a diode and tapped an autotransformer, saving energy and allowing
the dimmer to be installed in a standard electrical wall box."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"No, I believe it, but it's, like, the compact--"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"It's not a standard--"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"Yeah, like, CDs were invented in the '70s."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"Really?"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Yeah."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Wow."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"Any of our older listeners who were--"
01:38:07;01:38:08;"Right, right, right."
01:38:08;01:38:12;"--truly conscious in 1979, did you have a dimmer at your house?"
01:38:12;01:38:16;"If you were trying to set a mood, what did you do?"
01:38:16;01:38:22;"And if you were rich folks who had a fancy dimmer, you probably also had a CD player in 1979."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"That doesn't count."
01:38:23;01:38:33;"I just want to say, any of our kind of Joe Schmoe 1979 listeners, what did Joe Schmoe do in 1979 to set the mood?"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Give us a call."
01:38:35;01:38:41;"The number two song on the top five today, Ed Sheeran, ""Perfect."""
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Is this his ballad?"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Yeah, this is the song--"
01:38:44;01:38:45;"God, this song sucks."

01:56:49;01:56:51;"I'm very focused for the last two hours."
01:56:51;01:56:54;"Well, that's the number-one song on iTunes right now,"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"I mean, it's kind of -- it's different."
01:56:58;01:57:04;"You're not hearing that kind of, you know, Latin piano much."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"That's kind of fun."
01:57:05;01:57:08;"Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of banking on that as, like,"
01:57:08;01:57:12;"a cliche to just kind of pull from that grab bag."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Well, she's Cuban."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"She was born in Cuba."
01:57:15;01:57:18;"Just kind of leaning too heavily on that"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"already-established musical legacy."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"It just, like, is a pastiche to me."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"It doesn't hit me."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"Well, all right."
01:57:25;01:57:28;"Doesn't feel fresh, Ezra."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"I mean..."
01:57:29;01:57:31;"Jake Longstrap, ""Arbiter of Fresh."""
01:57:31;01:57:33;"That's Jake's take."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"Well, that was the top five."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"It's been an interesting show."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"Talked a lot about the dead."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Yeah, this is the most dead-intensive app."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"I really hope that even people don't listen to the dead."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"You know, we talked about the clothes."
01:57:45;01:57:48;"We talked about being a second-generation deadhead"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"with mixed feelings about it."
01:57:50;01:57:51;"We talked about..."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"Trump."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"We talked about Trump."
01:57:53;01:57:54;"We talked about..."
01:57:54;01:57:55;"Jerry doing the Levi's ad."
01:57:55;01:57:58;"We talked about how dick pics can be triggering."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Right."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"Hopefully we educated a few people, 'cause, you know,"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"there's probably a lot of guys out there who don't think about that."
01:58:04;01:58:05;"Yep."
01:58:05;01:58:08;"They're just like, ""So what? I'm a chill bro."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"""I listen to Grateful Dead bootlegs,"
01:58:10;01:58:13;"""fire off a couple pictures of my penis"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"""into a stranger's DMs."""
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Well, you know what, man?"
01:58:16;01:58:19;"The first part's cool."
01:58:19;01:58:20;"Not the second."
01:58:20;01:58:22;"People don't want to see that [bleep]"
01:58:22;01:58:23;"No."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"Don't do that unless you have permission."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"You can listen to dick pics without permission."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"You can go see Richard Pictures."
01:58:29;01:58:31;"You can go see Richard Pictures without permission."
01:58:31;01:58:34;"At a local SoCal venue."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Yeah, no, I mean, that's going to be a big reckoning,"
01:58:36;01:58:39;"is that as people hear some of these stories"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"and have to think more about their own behavior,"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"that includes in the digital realm."
01:58:44;01:58:45;"Oh, yeah."
01:58:45;01:58:47;"Let's send less unsolicited dick pics"
01:58:47;01:58:51;"and spend more time listening to Grateful Dead bootlegs."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"I think that's kind of the message of the show."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"And check out Richard Pictures."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"When's the next show, Jake, for the Dead Covermen?"
01:58:58;01:59:02;"Well, we played yesterday in Apple Valley."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"It was a hell of a show."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"Oh, so people--"
01:59:05;01:59:06;"Saturday."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"They missed it."
01:59:07;01:59:12;"Doing a show every two weeks makes scheduling kind of difficult."
01:59:12;01:59:16;"We're trying to book a New Year's show somewhere."
01:59:16;01:59:17;"Oh, that'd be sick."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"That could be fun."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"All right, well, thanks for listening, everybody."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:59:22;01:59:25;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:59:25;01:59:29;"[theme music]"
