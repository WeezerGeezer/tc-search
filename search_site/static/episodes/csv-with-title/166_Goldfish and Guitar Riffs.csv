00:00;00:09;"Goldfish, Jennifer Lopez, and of course Johnny Marr. In this episode we talked to"
00:09;00:13;"one of the greatest guitarists of all time, chow down on some new and exciting"
00:13;00:21;"snacks, talk about Jake's birthday, and listen to lots of great music. This is a"
00:21;00:29;"very special Big & Crispy Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:20;"Hello, welcome to Time Crisis. I had a little bit of a mic crisis at the"
01:20;01:25;"beginning of the show so you might notice that the audio quality sounds a"
01:25;01:30;"little bit phone-y, but stick with it. It doesn't last that long and we get back"
01:30;01:35;"on track real soon. Check it out. I'm not gonna front, we're recording this one on"
01:35;01:41;"Jake's actual birthday, so happy birthday Jake. Thank you, good friend. This is the"
01:41;01:49;"Big 4/5. Big 4/5? Started doing the show when I was 38. What? Wait, we've been"
01:49;01:55;"doing the show for seven years? Yeah, the show started in 15. Whoa. I was 38. I'm"
01:55;02:00;"almost 38. Dude, yeah, years between. We've almost completed a full years between run."
02:00;02:06;"Alright, well that's quite an achievement. We covered the years between. Gonna move"
02:06;02:14;"on to our next show. Time Crisis was a show about being 38. It started when one"
02:14;02:18;"co-host was 38 and then ended when the other co-host turned 38. I think it's a great way"
02:18;02:22;"to end the show. Experiment conducted by Harvard University. We still got some"
02:22;02:27;"gas in the tank though. So how do you feel about 45? Maybe there's something to"
02:27;02:33;"the psychology of ages that end in five. They seem significant. I remember 35 was"
02:33;02:42;"like, whoa. 35 is like unambiguously like grown-ass man age. Yeah. You're mid-decade."
02:42;02:47;"Right. Like my 40s are half over. That's wild. How messed up is that? Well, and"
02:47;02:53;"you're really looking down at 50, which is a classic age. I mean, let's face it,"
02:53;02:59;"they're all classic from here on out. I mean, you know, 44 and 46 kind of are like,"
02:59;03:03;"okay, yeah. Mid forties. But 45 is just like, I don't know, man, those fives hit"
03:03;03:14;"hard. 45 years old. 45. Yeah. That's pretty unambiguously grown up age. I mean,"
03:14;03:21;"especially because I think 60 is like unambiguously grown up. No, I think it"
03:21;03:26;"really is like that, especially in the, in our kind of like culture where all the"
03:26;03:32;"classic markers of previous generations, adulthood, like. They keep getting pushed"
03:32;03:36;"back. Yeah, keep getting pushed back because, you know, whatever back in the"
03:36;03:41;"day. They ship you off to war. You might not even be 18. Yeah. Back in the day,"
03:41;03:46;"definitely shipping like 16, 17 year olds off to war. It's like you come back from"
03:46;03:50;"that. You're like, yep, everything changed. I remember before they shipped me off and"
03:50;03:57;"uh, yeah, not a kid anymore. Get a job. You're like 24 homeowner, married, two kids."
03:57;04:04;"Veteran. So, you know, whatever. I'm not saying that's, that makes you an adult,"
04:04;04:09;"but it definitely changes the, the fabric of your life. Let's put it that way. And"
04:09;04:14;"then, you know, especially now in this like weird culture where even the content"
04:14;04:19;"people consume, it might be the same throughout their whole life or you have,"
04:19;04:23;"there's more leisure time to kind of like maintain your interest in, in comic"
04:23;04:28;"books or the MCU, music, whatever. I think that used to be some kind of like cutoff"
04:28;04:33;"**** too. Just like, oh yeah, I used to go see the pictures. Then I got shipped off,"
04:33;04:37;"came back, I haven't seen a movie in five years. Whereas today, you know, there's"
04:37;04:43;"people, there's a lot more fluidity. But yeah, I know so many people who say like,"
04:43;04:47;"oh yeah, no, you're 30. 30s are the new 20s. When you were, you know, when you're"
04:47;04:51;"20, you can't enjoy yourself in the same way when you're in your 30s. So then when"
04:51;04:56;"people kind of shift 30s into being like a 20s type time for having more fun and"
04:56;05:04;"exploring, whatever, then the 40s become the first unambiguously adult decade. I"
05:04;05:07;"totally could see, maybe not on this show, but I could see on some podcasts,"
05:07;05:11;"somebody just being like, bro, you're turning 60 next year. And it's like, yeah,"
05:11;05:13;"dude, I'm officially not a kid anymore."
05:16;05:19;"Or maybe it's gonna be like retirement age, whatever retirement age is gonna be,"
05:19;05:23;"it's gonna be like 75. When we're that age, I think that there might be people"
05:23;05:28;"just be like, when I officially started receiving like social security, that's"
05:28;05:33;"when I knew like, childhood was like officially over then. I mean, don't you"
05:33;05:37;"know, don't get me wrong, I'm still into all the same ****. But just like, yeah, I"
05:37;05:41;"look in the mirror. When I look in the mirror, yeah, I still feel like this"
05:41;05:45;"young dude. But when I look in the mirror, and I see an 87 year old man, I'm"
05:45;05:48;"like, all right, you know what, I do have some more like, adult"
05:48;05:50;"responsibilities now. You know,"
05:50;05:53;"I got to take my blood pressure medication first thing."
05:53;05:54;"Yep."
05:54;06:01;"I wonder how many 60 year olds or have podcasts. So a lot of people in their"
06:01;06:07;"20s, 30s, 40s. And a lot of the original crew, the the, you know, the Marons, the"
06:07;06:12;"Rogans, etc. were probably in their 30s or 40s when they started it. Now they're"
06:12;06:17;"in their 50s. But I wonder if it's just like, there's got to be dudes in their"
06:17;06:18;"60s that have podcasts."
06:18;06:24;"And I'm sure the number grows every day. Yeah, sure. 1000s, 10s of 1000s. And"
06:24;06:30;"definitely, you're going to get the phenomenon that because podcasting or,"
06:30;06:34;"you know, whatever the next version of it is, some type of streaming based,"
06:34;06:40;"interactive media will become this way that people communicate, I definitely"
06:40;06:44;"could foresee an era where you're like in a nursing home in the future, you can"
06:44;06:49;"just find this like, group of like, really old people sitting in circles with"
06:49;06:51;"microphones. It's not plugged in."
06:51;06:56;"Wet Hot American Summer style, just like the dangling. And just like the people"
06:56;07:00;"coming in just be like, Alright, guys, how's it going? And they're just kind of"
07:00;07:02;"sitting there like, Oh, we're having a really we're having a really good pod"
07:02;07:05;"today. And it's like, what do you what are you guys talking about? And they're"
07:05;07:08;"just like, we're talking about the second Thor movie and be like, that's"
07:08;07:14;"great, guys. Okay, press the button if anybody needs help. You know, whatever."
07:14;07:17;"It's just like playing canasta."
07:17;07:21;"You're gonna upload this pod later, right? Like asking the nurse?"
07:21;07:22;"Oh, yeah, get right on that."
07:22;07:29;"How many downloads of that last episode get? Oh, it's Mr. Longstreet. That's"
07:29;07:31;"doing very well."
07:31;07:36;"Oh, it's doing numbers, Mr. Longstreet. That's what I like to hear. Okay."
07:37;07:42;"The the fake podcasting setup. Why not?"
07:42;07:47;"If it makes you happy, can't be that bad. That's right. Cheryl Crow said it"
07:47;07:48;"best."
07:48;07:50;"I've been alone."
07:50;08:19;"A long way from here. Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes and drank till I was thirsty again. We were searching through thrift store jungles. Found your"
08:19;08:34;"on a Merced rifle, Marilyn shampoo and Benny Goodman's corset. I made this. I"
08:34;08:56;"promised you I'd never give up. If it makes you happy, it can't be that bad. If it makes you happy, then why the hell are you so sad?"
08:56;09:03;"We got you a whiskey glass. I just wanted to talk about it because it's kind of interesting learning about the world of novelty whiskey"
09:03;09:33;"glasses. Well, yeah, of course, interject that we had a really nice TC birthday dinner at your house last night. So I felt Nick came through with the best burritos in LA.
They were very good. Yeah, I think Nick said it's called burritos. Las Pamas. Yeah, shout out to that. So you know, Jake likes whiskey. And so we started looking up
whiskey glasses. And we've talked on the show about like novelty shirts and getting Jake increasingly aggressive. Not with shirts to wear, such as"
09:33;10:03;"his famous breaking news. I don't care shirt. Was it I don't give a or I don't care. I think it's actually I don't care. It would be so much better if it was breaking news. I
don't give a which especially in these troubled times, I'm sure it's a very useful shirt to have. But we wanted to get you a whiskey glass and we started looking up funny
whiskey glasses. And of course, like with anything, there's these like, cheap, dumb, a million versions of anything you could think of. So just like with t shirts, you
could find all these bizarre Facebook"
10:03;10:32;"shirts. There's the same thing for whiskey glasses. And we narrowed it down to a few. Some of them were very were a little too disturbing. And were vetoed by Seinfeld.
The one that I thought you might appreciate was a whiskey glass that said, Daddy's sippy cup. And I said, Well, this is perfect. Jake has a baby. So this is like made for a
dad with a young child, because of course, a baby would have a sippy cup. And then you have this whiskey"
10:32;10:43;"glass that says Daddy's sippy cup and the whole family can laugh about it. You could put it next to your daughter's sippy cup. Seinfeld thought it was creepy. What's
your take, Jake?"
10:43;11:06;"I'm glad you didn't get me that one. I'm not a fan of the phrase daddy. Self applying daddy. Right? If your kid calls you daddy, that's fine. I mean, I want her to
eventually transition to just straight up dad. I don't want like a nine year old calling me daddy. Not a fan. Dad. Okay. And so definitely I'm not into self applying
daddy."
11:06;11:19;"And I guess dad sippy cup wouldn't seem quite right. It's so fun. I remember last night, your son wandered in for a second, and I was like, cracking a brew and I could see
him eyeing the brew and you're like, that's a big boy drink."
11:19;11:29;"I mean, it is. It's a big boy drink. Cannabidello."
11:30;11:59;"It gets confusing with kids because when they get to be like, you know, two or three, you do start talking about, well, you know, you're a big boy now because it's
important to them to differentiate between when they were babies. You know, like little kids, they become very interested in those years. You'll see about like,
wait, so when I was a baby, I didn't do this. I didn't do that. Or they'll meet a baby and be like, oh, the baby can't, they don't have teeth yet. Well, they don't walk yet.
And like, yeah, that was you. That was you not that long ago. Oh, I didn't."
11:59;12:19;"They're like, yeah, now you're a big boy. But then, of course, you also sometimes use big boy to refer to like grown up stuff. So big boy has this very, this very ambiguous
phrase where I think he understood what I meant. Because if he presses him, if he said, but dad, I'm a big boy, I sleep in a big boy bed. I'd be like, okay, I got to revise
that. Beer is not a big boy drink. Beer is an adult beverage."
12:19;12:29;"He's I mean, he definitely, you know, he was like, copy that. He seemed to understand it immediately. Yeah, there's multiple levels of big boys."
12:29;12:43;"Yeah, it's one of those things where in the English language, big boy has many meanings. And, you know, as a native English speaker, you just get it. Even at three years
old context clues. I'm a big boy. You're a big boy. We're not the same. Both big boys."
12:43;12:53;"So yeah, I'm glad you guys didn't get me daddy sippy cup. I'm glad you didn't get me the F Biden one. Although that would have been pretty funny. Straight up F Biden."
12:53;13:19;"We got into the political ones. And there was just F Biden, just to kind of like, disturb your guests. Yeah. Just picturing Jake being like, hey, you want a whiskey?
Pulling out the F Biden whiskey and probably like most people, you know, be like, I'm gonna leave. I'm not comfortable with that. But then on the other side of the
spectrum, Seinfeld was voting for one that said Kamala Harris is my hero."
13:19;13:43;"That I don't understand. Why is that on a whiskey glass? Like, is that is that ironic? Like, oh, man, Kamala Harris is my hero. That's pathetic. I'm gonna get drunk. No,
no, no. It's just like, I mean, at that point, you could just put anyone on there. Just like, I mean, we're living in the mass produced cheap niche. Yeah. Junkie age.
Although the whiskey glass wasn't that junkie when it came. But I mean, maybe this is my bias."
13:43;14:03;"But when I think picture a whiskey drinker, I'm picturing that they're going to be selling a lot more F Biden whiskey glasses than Kamala Harris is my hero. But maybe
that's totally incorrect in 2022. And for all we know, there's hundreds of thousands of people who sip in a fine scotch nightly with a Kamala Harris is my hero whiskey
glass."
14:03;14:18;"The K-Hive. Why would the K-Hive not like whiskey? I don't know. Yeah, maybe we should have bought you both. Be like, hey, Jake, however you're feeling on that given
day, either bust out the F Biden or the Kamala Harris is my hero. Be like, uh, thanks. I don't want either."
14:18;14:39;"There's this really dark school of whiskey glass that was seemed to be about like alcoholism. And I found one that said in big font, shut up, liver, you'll be fine. Weird
thing to put on a whiskey glass. But that was like one of the first ones that came up. Shut up, liver, you'll be fine."
14:39;14:52;"Yeah, that one's just sort of like, oh, not that funny. Yeah, too dark. That's just basically like, yes, I'm abusing myself and I'm proud of it. Yep. Cirrhosis. So what
you decide on."
14:52;15:09;"So in the end, the one that felt right and felt like the that you'd appreciate, it's a kind of a complicated one with three lines. It's kind of interesting. It's kind of an
interactive one because each line would denote how much whiskey is in the cup."
15:09;15:25;"So at the very top, implying that you have a full glass of whiskey, you haven't started to consume your whiskey yet in a spooky font. Anybody who sees this cup, it's a very
familiar spooky font that's often used in Halloween decorations and things like that."
15:25;15:42;"In a spooky font, it says, don't even ask. So meaning you haven't started your whiskey beverage yet. So don't even ask. You're not ready to interact with somebody. And
then below that, it says bad day. So you've gone from don't even ask to bad day."
15:42;15:57;"Maybe you've had a few sips of whiskey. And then finally, when you've consumed most of the whiskey beverage, the line says good day. I interpreted this totally
differently. Really? I interpreted it in the reverse way, which is when you're filling the whiskey glass."
15:57;16:13;"If it's been a good day, you don't need that much. So you just fill it up to good day. That's the lowest line. If it's been a bad day, fill it up a little bit more to I've had a
bad day. I need a drink. And then if you've had a really bad day, you fill it all the way up to the don't even ask."
16:13;16:30;"Honey, how was your day? Don't even ask. Fill up the whiskey to that line. Okay, you know what you're saying makes more sense. I guess my interpretation is based on a
school of coffee related products like coffee cups that because you know, there's the famously don't talk to me until I've had my coffee."
16:30;16:47;"It's a classic and that's the morning version. And then there's probably a certain type of person who is not necessarily an alcoholic, but maybe just a stressed out
person who likes to unwind with a whiskey who at the end of the day would have the same feeling of don't talk to me until I've consumed this whole whiskey."
16:47;17:07;"So on the coffee cups that I'm talking about, the idea is that you fill the coffee cup to the top and then it says like, don't even talk to me, whatever. And then as it goes
down, now you may speak. All right, let's have some fun, whatever. You know, as you consume the coffee, you're more and more ready. It's kind of just a breakdown of the
phrase don't even talk to me until I've had my coffee."
17:07;17:27;"I just thought of this is the type of thing that's very probably unfunny to most people. It would be funny to do a mashup of the coffee cups that have these gradations of
like how ready you are to talk to somebody. Don't even look at me. You may enter the room almost there. Now you may speak. Let's talk, whatever."
17:27;17:54;"But then mashing it up with these water bottles that have like really like positive affirmative statements like you're the best. Keep going. Have you ever seen these
ones where you're supposed to drink all the water through the day? You're amazing. You're a freaking rock star. Keep going. This would be maybe funny for like three
people. But if we just put the coffee ones on the water bottle and people can give it to each other. And as you drink your whatever two liters of water, it just says, don't
even look at me. Now you may speak, whatever."
17:54;18:04;"It's a very niche thing, but very niche for people who are really into these types of products. I think maybe somebody would enjoy that type of humor. Don't even talk to
me until I've consumed two liters of water."
18:04;18:28;"Don't stay awake for too long. Don't go to bed. I'll make a cup of coffee for your head. I'll get you up and going out of bed. And I promise that one day I'll feel fine."
18:28;18:55;"And I promise that one day I'll feel alright. And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar, how you like it? And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right
amount of sugar, how you like it? How you like it?"
18:55;19:06;"The humor really makes me think of Garfield. I'm just trying to think of like, where did this humor come from? I'm thinking Garfield reminds me of like a Garfield poster
in like a dentist office."
19:06;19:17;"Yeah, no, it's definitely it definitely has like that kind of like slightly wry grown up newspaper comic vibe. Yeah. Like a little Garfield, a little Dilbert, a little
Cathy."
19:17;19:32;"Yeah, it's great stuff. You know, people talk about like kind of millennials inventing the kind of like corny adulting is hard, you know, language, but maybe it really
goes back almost adulting is hard."
19:32;19:45;"Daddy needs a sippy cup. But I think truly, that actually started with the boomers. It was like boomer cartoonists who invented this kind of vibe of just like going to
work. Yikes."
19:45;20:00;"You know, just like the slightly, yeah, just Mondays. This kind of just like, slightly negative, like life sucks vibe. I'd rather be fishing. Work sucks. Don't even
talk to me until I've had my coffee. Go to hell."
20:00;20:19;"I bet that must have emerged in like the late 70s. That's my guess. Garfield started in 78. The baby boomer generation's really like deep into their careers into the
late, starting in the late 70s. They're all around 30. I don't think that those existed like Mondays like in like 1968."
20:19;20:42;"It also makes me wonder, we've got to get somebody on like a labor historian, a Marxist, a Marxist professor just to talk about like this very modern 20th century and now
21st century idea of just like work sucks Mondays. Like, are there antecedents of that in like 19th century like sweatshops and factories?"
20:42;20:50;"Like in Lowell, Massachusetts, was there kind of like a vibe of like, Mondays work sucks."
20:50;21:02;"No, it was so grim. They're working like 18 hour days. It's so grim. There's no, there's no room for like this kind of existential wry bird's eye view of the world. And
they didn't even have weekends."
21:02;21:07;"That's right. If you're chilling on the weekend, thank a union."
21:07;21:09;"Yeah. Thank the labor movement."
21:09;21:11;"Work sucks."
21:11;21:22;"People walking into some like, there's like covered in like soot. They're walking into some like factory and like some like Charles Dickens nightmare. And they're
just like, dude, work sucks."
21:22;21:30;"Just take a time machine and somebody's just like, just say to the other guys, don't even talk to me until I've had my coffee."
21:30;21:43;"When you talk about the Dilbert's and stuff, these are people with white collar jobs. So of course you could imagine that they have the privilege to complain a bit more
because their job is not pure hell."
21:43;21:55;"Maybe it's like, it's a type of mental agony, but it's like, you know, if Dilbert wanted to like quit, maybe downsize, he probably can make it work at least for a few
months."
21:55;21:58;"I'm imagining Dilbert was not, was not living paycheck to paycheck."
21:58;22:00;"Let's get Scott Adams on the phone."
22:00;22:04;"Get to the bottom of this."
22:04;22:16;"Scott Adams come through. Yeah. But I know what you mean. Like, is there this kind of like case of the Mondays? Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee type stuff. How
much does that exist?"
22:16;22:21;"Is that just like a fundamentally kind of like American middle class thing?"
22:21;22:23;"I think it is."
22:23;22:36;"Yeah, I think I might, I might go back to school and become a labor historian, get a PhD in my 300 page dissertation is going to be like case of the Mondays, middle class
American office, culture, humor in a global context."
22:36;22:41;"From Garfield to Dilbert and beyond."
22:41;22:55;"And I'll just be like, just rolling all around the world to various type of work environments and be like, yeah, you know, it's, it's interesting. I couldn't find too
many cases of the Mondays around the globe."
22:55;23:05;"You just go full Rivers Cuomo, man. You quit the band. You become an academic for a while. Yeah. It's just getting his PhD from Harvard and labor history."
23:05;23:14;"I'm trying to track down the first known case of the Mondays. The first known case of the Mondays. That's a good, that's a good title."
23:14;23:43;"Good phrase."
23:43;24:07;"First, you love me."
24:07;24:18;"We could ask this guy if he ever gets a case of the Mondays because he's not American, he's English. And in fact, as far as I'm concerned, I think he he's one of the best
guitarists of all time."
24:18;24:19;"Damn."
24:19;24:38;"I've always been a massive fan. Very honored to have him on the show. Johnny Marr coming through famous for his work with the Smiths. He's also done all sorts of
incredible work. He's played with Talking Heads. He had a dope band with Bernard Sumner, Electronic. You know Electronic, Jake?"
24:38;24:39;"I don't know that band. No."
24:39;24:50;"They have a great song called Getting Away With It. He was in Modest Mouse and he's released a lot of great solo albums. Anyway, honored to have him on the show. Let's get
Johnny Marr on the horn."
24:50;24:57;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
24:57;24:58;"Hello."
24:58;25:00;"Hey, Johnny, welcome to the show."
25:00;25:02;"Thanks for inviting me. Nice to see you all."
25:02;25:06;"Oh, thanks for coming through. Yeah, I'm Ezra and you're also joined by Jake and Nick."
25:06;25:07;"I'm Jake."
25:07;25:09;"Hi Jake. Hi Nick."
25:09;25:10;"Pleasure."
25:10;25:12;"Have we met before, Nick?"
25:12;25:22;"I don't believe so. I will say there's definitely something about my face in general that I do. I think that I look like people other people have met."
25:22;25:26;"Yeah, it's classic. You've got like a classic face."
25:26;25:28;"What about my face?"
25:28;25:32;"I'll just get into that. Wait for it."
25:32;25:34;"It's definitely not classic, though."
25:34;25:35;"You're one in a billion."
25:35;25:36;"I'll take it."
25:36;25:37;"So where are you, Johnny?"
25:37;25:44;"I'm just in the outskirts of Manchester. I'm in a little room at the back of my studio where we do some editing."
25:44;25:51;"And it's been a really amazing spring day in Manchester for some reason. Weird."
25:51;25:52;"In February."
25:52;25:56;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So where are you guys? Where is everyone? New York?"
25:56;25:58;"No, we're all in L.A. now, actually."
25:58;25:59;"Okay."
25:59;26:10;"Having a pretty typical L.A. day. Okay, my first question, and I was just talking about the fact that you're one of my favorite guitarists of all time. I think you're the
greatest."
26:10;26:20;"And so this is a question I've always had, and I feel like I found bits and pieces of it, but it's been very important to me in my development, in my kind of naive guitar
style."
26:20;26:29;"When I was growing up and listening to your work, a friend of mine said, shout out to my friend Raj, Raj Halder, great musician, smart guy."
26:29;26:36;"We were young. We were like in high school. And he said, Johnny Marr definitely, and we were listening to like early Smith stuff."
26:36;26:41;"And he was like, he definitely is influenced by African guitar playing, like high life."
26:41;26:46;"And I was like, yeah, it really sounds like it. You know, he was listening to like this charming man."
26:46;26:51;"Then I remember when I was starting Vampire Weekend, I was like trying to learn how to play this charming man."
26:51;27:03;"And I was kind of like looking at the way you play it. And whenever I've looked up like Johnny Marr, high life, whatever, you always find these articles where people say,
oh, Johnny Marr is influenced by so many different guitarists, this and that, including high life."
27:03;27:11;"And I've never actually found the quote where you make that connection explicit other than saying that you're like a fan of the music."
27:11;27:21;"So I've always wondered this. So just like late 70s, early 80s, Manchester, young Johnny Marr playing guitar. Were you listening to high life? And if so, what?"
27:21;27:29;"Not at all. Not at all. Not in no way whatsoever. I didn't know what high life was."
27:29;27:40;"When this charming man came out, and I guess a short time after it, it was appearing, what you've just described started to happen."
27:40;27:51;"So I was like, oh, right, I better find out what high life's about. So it was, and John Peel, then I was, I was noticing it on John Peel, but I didn't know anything about King
Sunny a day."
27:51;28:02;"I didn't know anything about anyone, you know, so no. And you know what I quite like about that, I can see why people ask that question and why people put two and two
together."
28:02;28:14;"And it makes me realize that what I was doing on not just on this charming man, but a few of those other early things is kind of eccentric. And then I'm like, what the f***
were you thinking?"
28:14;28:28;"That's to me is a very innocent. A lot of it's to do with being the age I was at. I mean, I knew plenty for a kid of my age. So what was 18, 19 then and I've been in plenty of bands,
but I honestly was not doing that."
28:28;28:37;"And I like this thing that you're describing, this guitar technique. I like that that is a feature of my playing because I can't really say where I got it from."
28:37;28:52;"It's just me just trying to pick out, just really trying to pick out a melody. But the one thing that is a part of it is culturally, to get slightly pretentious about it, a
big part of what was going on was in '80, '81, '82."
28:52;29:03;"And it sounds like you will know about this. Myself and my peers were dealt as guitar players, and I'm sure it's the same for bass players and singers and other people in
the arts."
29:03;29:15;"We were dealt a hand of cards, if you like, that said that I mustn't be blues rock, that I mustn't have too many effects on, that I mustn't be cliched, that I mustn't be too
classic rock."
29:15;29:25;"There's all these like, impositions and restrictions. Okay. And how myself and my peers dealt with those restrictions made you interested in."
29:25;29:35;"So Roddy Frayn from Aztec Camera, he dealt with it his way. Charlie Birchall from Simple Minds dealt with it in his way. Will Sargent from the Bunnymen dealt with it in
his way."
29:35;29:49;"And so there's no distortion. There's no sustain. That was a no-no. Even Jordy from Killing Joke, who's got a very menacing, very distorted sound. He wasn't playing
blues rock."
29:49;29:58;"So my point being is that because there was a whole load of sounds that I couldn't beat, I had to, in one way, it made me play that way."
29:58;30:10;"Because I am a melody freak, B, approach is slightly eccentric, and C, I had to do something with that skinny little sound. So it meant that I had to play quite a lot,
hyperactively."
30:10;30:11;"Does that make sense?"
30:11;30:20;"Yeah, oh, totally. No, that's amazing to hear. I truly have wondered about this for years. And it really is. It's amazing to hear it straight from you because it's the
type of thing."
30:20;30:28;"Yeah, I'm sure you're on record and also you'd have a long, illustrious career. I'm sure at this point in your life, you've probably heard everything and you've taken
bits and pieces."
30:28;30:33;"But yeah, it's so interesting to me to think about. So how old were you exactly? Why don't we just focus on this Charming Men?"
30:33;30:43;"And I can see how you were operating within these restrictions of what felt cool and fresh at the time. And you weren't going to be ripping Clapton blues solos or heavy
distorted stuff."
30:43;30:48;"But so when you're working on this Charming Men, you were like 18 or 19?"
30:48;30:52;"Yeah, probably 19. Yeah. I wrote it in about 20 seconds."
30:52;30:53;"And that was like 80?"
30:53;31:02;"No, no, no. The band would go in. What happened was we'd already had a single out. And over here in the UK at that time, the John Peel show was like the thing."
31:02;31:03;"Right."
31:03;31:17;"Radio DJ John Peel had this late night show, and he used to play counterculture music. So our peers, if you, you know, obviously pre, pre internet. So if you were like a, I
don't even think it was called indie then."
31:17;31:29;"But if you were like an indie kid, say, right, and you had invested in music, you would listen to John Peel every night, every weeknight between, I guess it was like nine,
midnight or nine and 11 or something like that."
31:29;31:30;"Yeah."
31:30;31:46;"He would play really obscure stuff. Sometimes he'd play B-Flat. Now John Peel, by the way, he went back to the 60s to 1968, 69. He became an institution. There isn't
really, this is a clumsy way of putting it, but it's almost like what Rodney Bingham hired us."
31:46;31:48;"What's to the West Coast in a way."
31:48;31:49;"So yeah, on K-Rock."
31:49;32:01;"Yeah. So counterculture. So he was your go-to guy and you would hear B-Far and you would hear lots of The Fall and you would hear like loads, Joy Division and all of that.
This one, I was a kid, right?"
32:01;32:19;"But he would do these sessions where you would go into the BBC, usually an unsigned band or a fledgling band, and you would record four songs in a day. So we had, the Smiths
did our very first John Peel session. This is before this charming man, right? We did. So maybe we had 10 songs."
32:19;32:20;"Like Hand in Glove."
32:20;32:44;"Yeah, maybe we had 10. We did Handsome Devil, Hand in Glove, Miserable Lie and something else. Hand that Rocks the Cradle, I think. So we did that session and it blew up.
It was a big deal. So then straight we got another session a few weeks down the line. And about a week before that session happened, I got out of bed 10am one morning, which
was early for me."
32:44;33:04;"I thought, we need a fast one. We need something in a major key, pretty sharpish. So I just played the chords and then I played the riff on top of it. And I'm just like,
right, bang. Okay, bingo. So I mean, you'll know yourself being a musician when it's a bit like needs must, I didn't know I'd be talking about it 40 years later or
whatever."
33:04;33:25;"Right, right, right."
33:25;33:38;"So my critical faculties were completely down. And it was just a really, it was a little bit like, you know, adversity, just probably adversity, you know. So what's the
phrase? It's a mother of invention. What is it?"
33:38;33:39;"Necessity."
33:39;33:46;"Yeah. Necessity is the mother of invention. Yeah, that's, that's, thank you. So that's kind of how it happened."

35:04;35:13;"When you're 18 or 19 in that era, when you reflect on that time, so you hadn't heard King Sunny Odd Day or any High Life yet, what would you have said were your influences?"
35:13;35:18;"Or is it more just the way you put it? You were actually, it was more about what you were trying not to be."
35:18;35:26;"I think at that age, whether you're in the arts or not, when you've got that teenage thing going, there's plenty of trying to not be things."
35:26;35:27;"Yeah."
35:27;35:37;"You don't want to be on hip. You don't want to be, I don't know what the American term is, you know, back in the States, it was all about don't be a jock, you know, that's what
alternative is."
35:37;35:54;"It was kind of like, my frame of mind, to be honest, right, this is the deal. When I formed the band, sure, I was hoping that we were going to be big, but it was more important
that my pals thought we were cool, you know, and my pals, the music we were listening to was really not at all commercial."
35:54;35:59;"I mean, the early Smith stuff is unusual music with unusual singing on the top."
35:59;36:00;"Oh, absolutely."
36:00;36:09;"You know, the very early stuff and I kind of thought that's where we'd be. So the bands that I was listening to, I was really super, super into the Gun Club."
36:09;36:10;"Oh, yeah."
36:10;36:23;"And before that, leading up to the Smiths, I was really into the Cramps and I was into the early psychedelic furs. But when I put the band together, you sort of taste
change almost every three weeks."
36:23;36:32;"You get a new agenda, a new manifesto every three weeks. So, you know, there was a label out of Scotland called Postcard that had this band called Joseph Kaeun."
36:32;36:38;"And then Rough Trade also had the Monochrome set and they were a little kind of literate."
36:38;36:44;"And then plus, I'd met Matt Johnson, who was putting together The There at that time, and he'd done a solo record."
36:44;36:53;"So it was all this sort of real kind of classic, anything that wasn't the mainstream. And in my case, I happened to be, I wanted to do it on guitar."
36:53;37:02;"But really, a lot of stuff that was inventive was people, you know, doing stuff on keyboards and on drum machines and sort of slightly industrial."
37:02;37:08;"But I wanted to find a way of a guitar band joining in, my band being in that space."
37:08;37:14;"Sure. Well, it's interesting, though, because a lot of the bands that you're naming are still like kind of rock bands."
37:14;37:21;"And I wonder if similar to the High Life thing where that's actually music that you maybe felt a kinship with after you'd written a lot of this music."
37:21;37:31;"What about like jazz? Because like, or even like Brazilian music, because like you're famous for having like such an idiosyncratic and sophisticated harmonic sense."
37:31;37:38;"Like when you were 18 or 19, did you like know who Pat Metheny was? Had you listened to like late Joni Mitchell?"
37:38;37:46;"Oh, I mean, I knew The Hissing of Summer Lawns. Well, Headmaster Ritual started out like me trying to write something like The Hissing of Summer Lawns, Edith and the
King."
37:46;37:53;"Oh, OK. Oh, well, the reason that didn't show up for a while was because I was almost too embarrassed because it was so jazzy."
37:53;37:58;"I didn't know Pat Metheny. I wouldn't have liked Pat Metheny back then because he wouldn't have been, he would have been too slick."
37:58;38:09;"But I really, I got into McCoy Tyner when I was about 15. This older guy turned me on to McCoy. And to this day, McCoy Tyner is almost like a saint to me, really."
38:09;38:24;"So, and of course, I really loved Nile Rodgers. And this was when, way after Sheekah had their hits and Nile was playing on the Z label and he was playing on all these
sessions and was turning up and he was starting to produce."
38:24;38:31;"And he was still having hits with people like Danny Ross and stuff, but he was on this track with material on the Z label called I'm The One."
38:31;38:39;"So, because I was going to a lot of clubs and stuff, I was just, the minute I got out of bed in the morning, I was just soaking everything up, everything, everything."
38:45;39:07;"I am the one, the only one for you, yeah."
39:07;39:23;"You, you've got to know by now, I'm gonna see it through,"
39:23;39:24;"You've got to be the one for me."
39:24;39:25;"Ooh, I know what to do, Ooh, I know you know it too,"
39:25;39:26;"When you're close enough to touch, I can feel it in my bones."
39:26;39:43;"Don't hold back to love you, I'm the one you're on."
39:43;39:46;"Were you studying theory at all?"
39:46;39:51;"Or you could listen to McCoy, Tyner and Sheik and kind of start to piece out harmonically"
39:51;39:54;"what was happening and then apply it in The Smiths?"
39:54;39:56;"I was totally by ear, I've got a really good ear."
39:56;40:00;"And it's the only, the only, you know, when I've done some interviews over the years,"
40:00;40:02;"it's a classic older person answer."
40:02;40:06;"But when I'm asked about having any regrets, I, so I have got to that age now where I'll"
40:06;40:11;"go probably really wish that I'd learned, listened a little more in music class, you"
40:11;40:13;"know, although the teacher was a ****."
40:13;40:19;"It worked out okay, but, but theory, well, it's interesting because what I'd worked with"
40:19;40:24;"John for Shanity, which was, I guess, I don't know when that, maybe 2011 or something like"
40:24;40:29;"that, everything John pulled up in his studio, I was just putting the guitar in a tuning."
40:29;40:32;"So I deliberately didn't know what the **** the chords were."
40:32;40:37;"As I remember, he was kind of a bit surprised that I didn't want to know what the chords"
40:37;40:38;"were."
40:38;40:43;"I completely wanted to anti-theory and that's worked out okay for me."
40:43;40:47;"But I was a little like, this is going to sound really corny."
40:47;40:50;"It probably is corny, but it works for me."
40:50;40:56;"When I was about 15, 16, maybe earlier, I realized I was a little like a human jukebox"
40:56;40:57;"in a way."
40:57;40:59;"I can hear changes very well."
40:59;41:02;"I've got a good ear for changes."
41:02;41:06;"That was just something that happened in my house because my family were super musical."
41:06;41:10;"Obviously I knew what one four five was and I knew what, what one to six was."
41:10;41:13;"And I could hear seven, all of those sorts of things."
41:13;41:17;"I could hear ninths and all of that from being like a little kid, didn't know what they were."
41:17;41:22;"And that helped me write songs because I'd be on the bus in school and I'd be going,"
41:22;41:25;"okay, yeah, I go to G, you know, G to E minor six."
41:25;41:26;"Yeah, do that three times."
41:26;41:27;"Okay."
41:27;41:28;"And then, oh, wow."
41:28;41:29;"Okay."
41:29;41:30;"Would that be a key change if I got a C sharp minor?"
41:30;41:33;"I know I just live in my head like that really."
41:33;41:34;"It worked."
41:34;41:35;"Right."
41:35;41:36;"And that makes a lot of sense."
41:36;41:40;"One thing that I'm curious about, thinking about Frusciante, so he's kind of famously"
41:40;41:43;"like a huge like Hendrix acolyte."
41:43;41:48;"Is Hendrix the type of just like classic rock guitar playing that like, like how did you"
41:48;41:50;"feel about Hendrix when you were like 18, 19?"
41:50;41:54;"Well 18, 19, it wasn't of any use to me, you know what I mean?"
41:54;41:59;"But I've got the classic things like, you know, it's probably the same now, 13."
41:59;42:05;"If you're a guitar nut and you and your pals, I was really into, I was first and foremost"
42:05;42:08;"a super, super into guitar and rock culture."
42:08;42:11;"I was really, really into girls and I was really into football."
42:11;42:18;"And so at 13, 14, just before punk happened, I'd go and see every single band that was"
42:18;42:19;"around."
42:19;42:21;"So I didn't care whether I liked them or not."
42:21;42:22;"Most of the time I didn't like them."
42:22;42:23;"Thin Lizzy were great."
42:23;42:25;"I saw Thin Lizzy a lot."
42:25;42:28;"And I liked Rory Gallaher as well."
42:28;42:31;"So one of my pals was really super into Ritchie Blackmore."
42:31;42:34;"So I knew about what he was doing."
42:34;42:37;"Another one of my pals was really into Jimmy Page."
42:37;42:39;"Another one who was Billy Duffy from the cult."
42:39;42:44;"He was really into Paul Kossoff and Ronson and Townsend."
42:44;42:49;"So me and all my mates all had our own little bits of speciality and I would like, find"
42:49;42:50;"what was interesting."
42:50;42:55;"So I knew, so by the time I was 17, 18, I knew that my favourite Jimi Hendrix track"
42:55;42:57;"was Easy Rider."
42:57;43:03;"And I knew that I felt that my favourite album was Electric Ladyland, hands down."
43:03;43:07;"I've never changed my opinion about that, you know, 1983 and Rainy Day Dream Away."
43:07;43:13;"You know, I just soaked all of that up, but it was of no use to me at that point."
43:13;43:15;"You know, it was of no use to me."
43:15;43:16;"I knew it."
43:16;43:18;"But like I know loads of stuff now."
43:18;43:20;"Well, you could always know more."
43:20;43:25;"But as an artist, I think, especially in this day and age, you know, of information overload,"
43:25;43:29;"I tune out what isn't of much use for me, you know."
43:29;43:34;"But I like stuff, music, I like, I love John McLaughlin."
43:34;43:38;"Right, so is John McLaughlin somebody that you got into later in life?"
43:38;43:42;"In about '98 with Shakti."
43:42;43:48;"I got into John McLaughlin and then I re-evaluated Jimi Hendrix because I got super into John"
43:48;43:49;"Coltrane."
43:49;43:52;"I understood what these guys are doing."
43:52;43:53;"I get it."
43:53;43:54;"They're like, it's like praying."
43:54;44:00;"You get so adept on the instrument, you practice, you get so adept on it that the instrument"
44:00;44:06;"almost becomes invisible and you just go, you just emote and there is no barrier between"
44:06;44:08;"you and what you're expressing."
44:08;44:11;"That's what I understand John Coltrane was trying to do."
44:11;44:17;"Are you a fan of that McLaughlin, Santana record?"
44:17;44:18;"Not massively, no."
44:18;44:20;"They cover Love Supreme on that."
44:20;44:22;"I think the record's called A Love Supreme."
44:22;44:23;"It's called A Love and Devotion."
44:23;44:27;"Wait, the same track, A Love Supreme to the Coltrane."
44:27;44:30;"No, but they cover Love Supreme track one."
44:30;44:31;"I love that record."
44:31;44:33;"Oh, they're just like, let's redo Love Supreme."
44:33;44:34;"Yeah."
44:35;44:38;"Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin just like trading solos."
44:38;44:45;"Although I feel like McLaughlin kind of buries Santana a little bit, but I'm into that record."
44:45;44:46;"Yeah."
44:46;44:52;"No, I, I, I mean, you know, people just will not believe it, but sometimes I just think"
44:52;44:55;"Shakti is the greatest group that ever was, you know."
44:55;44:56;"Interesting."
44:56;45:23;"Yeah."
45:23;45:29;"Have you ever gotten into like improvisatory music personally?"
45:29;45:34;"Like what's like the longest solo you've ever ripped on record or off?"
45:34;45:40;"Interestingly enough, I did this movie, first movie I was involved with, it's called Colors."
45:40;45:41;"It was a Dennis Hopper movie."
45:41;45:45;"It was about kind of the gang thing."
45:45;45:48;"And the opening sequence, you know, it's like with movies, they just get chopped down."
45:48;45:51;"But the original opening sequence was really long."
45:51;45:52;"It was amazing."
45:52;45:58;"It was the first thing I played on and it was me and Charlie Drayton and Steve Jordan."
45:58;46:03;"And it was this real kind of voodoo-y, they had this really heavy thing going and it was"
46:03;46:06;"that I'm scared out of my wits really."
46:06;46:08;"And I hadn't even met Dennis Hopper yet."
46:08;46:10;"But this is true story."
46:10;46:16;"Herbie Hancock was the MD and I went into the studio and we had the opening scene on"
46:16;46:22;"the screen and they put down this groove and it must have been seven or eight minutes."
46:22;46:25;"And I was just playing over the top of it."
46:25;46:32;"And about two minutes into this thing, I felt this presence right up against my face."
46:32;46:36;"And Dennis Hopper had come in the studio, check me out."
46:36;46:40;"He's just right in my face and he was going, ""Make it sound like the cops, man."
46:40;46:43;"Make it sound like the cops."""
46:43;46:47;"The guitar represented the police?"
46:47;46:49;"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
46:49;46:54;"And I started playing kind of out of my skin, really trying to make all these noises and"
46:54;46:58;"doing all these dive bombs and all stuff that people wouldn't think that I'd be doing."
46:58;47:01;"But he was like, ""What was the character in Blue Velvet?"
47:01;47:02;"Is it Frank?"""
47:02;47:05;"Oh yeah, that really scary Dennis Hopper guy."
47:05;47:07;"He was kind of that thing."
47:07;47:11;"And we got through the end of this music, which eventually, movies being movies, got"
47:11;47:15;"cut, really got cut, or maybe it's just a slither in the film now."
47:15;47:20;"But right at the end of it, I played this thing and I was really, really digging it."
47:20;47:26;"And he got right in my face and he just grinned and he just said, he just went, ""I like you,"
47:26;47:27;"Johnny."""
47:27;47:32;"And I was like, ""Okay, we got to find this tape, man."
47:32;47:39;"We got to hear the whole eight minute Johnny Marr, Herbie Hancock produced psychedelic"
47:39;47:40;"LAPD music."""
47:40;47:43;"Yeah, it was out there."
47:43;47:49;"But, you know, the older I get, the more I just sort of appreciate, trying to appreciate"
47:49;47:52;"music in an impressionistic way, if I can."
47:52;47:56;"It's one of the reasons why the jazz I like, I don't sit there going, ""Oh, right."
47:56;47:59;"Okay, the bass player's trying to be Flea."
47:59;48:05;"The programming sounds a little bit like MGMT and you know, that **** that we all do."""
48:05;48:08;"I just deal with it like an impressionistic painting."
48:08;48:11;"And I really love that because it gives me my innocence back."
48:11;48:14;"I just don't know how it's put together."
48:14;48:15;"Hey, don't get me wrong."
48:15;48:18;"I don't like anything that just goes squawk."
48:18;48:21;"I like some that's a good listen."
48:21;48:27;"But the stuff I do like, I absolutely adore, you know, Horace Silver, Bill Evans, as I"
48:27;48:29;"say, you know, McCoy Town and stuff like that."
48:29;48:32;"But I just, that gets me away from my day job."
48:32;48:35;"I can just enjoy that kind of music."
48:35;48:39;"And same with stuff like ETO Peaks, you know, I can really..."
48:39;48:40;"Amazing music."
48:40;48:44;"With these time signatures and I can just, it's great."
48:44;48:49;"But I don't want to make that music, which is interesting, you know, because when I had"
48:49;48:54;"that band The Healers in the early 2000s, I learned a lesson, which is that it's not"
48:54;49:01;"your job really to just lay your enthusiasms on an audience, you know, just save it for"
49:01;49:02;"home."
49:02;49:04;"Because we used to do some gigs with that band."
49:04;49:08;"We played a festival somewhere where I just sat on the stage and I just watched this six"
49:08;49:12;"piece band I had just jam for about seven minutes."
49:12;49:13;"No one needs that."
49:13;49:15;"- Well, I guess it depends on the audience."
49:15;49:18;"That actually is a good tee up for my next question, which is something we talk about"
49:18;49:20;"a lot on the show."
49:20;49:28;"Do you have any relationship or enthusiasm, history with the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia?"
49:28;49:37;"- My previous manager, John Moss, who died in 2016, he was a very philosophical, he was"
49:37;49:38;"a big stoner."
49:38;49:43;"He was one of the original beatniks, you know, from the sixties and stuff."
49:43;49:46;"You know, he died too young, but he was in his seventies."
49:46;49:48;"He was an amazing, amazing man."
49:48;49:53;"And he used to always, not always, but he often tried to indoctrinate me and he tried"
49:53;49:55;"to wise me up to the ways of the dead."
49:55;49:56;"So I get it."
49:56;49:59;"It's not, it's just too inflected to me."
49:59;50:00;"There's a, I have a kind of..."
50:00;50:01;"- What inflected?"
50:01;50:02;"- Country inflected."
50:02;50:07;"- Ah, see, I would have thought that you would like country because that really great like"
50:07;50:11;"chicken picking country guitar, that's kind of bright and clean."
50:11;50:14;"And that doesn't feel like a million miles away from stuff you might like."
50:14;50:18;"- No, well, my parents are absolute aficionados of country."
50:18;50:20;"So you mean you kind of rebel really."
50:20;50:25;"And, you know, I know all about, I love, you know, I mean, I love Loretta Lynn as a person."
50:25;50:33;"I'm really in mind, you know, and you know, all of that stuff and the players and I really"
50:33;50:39;"respect them, but the dead, I like what they represented, but no, it's too noodley for"
50:39;50:42;"me, just too noodley and not enough minor chords."
50:42;50:45;"- Can we make you a playlist of like some..."
50:45;50:47;"- Yeah, there's a lot of non-country dead."
50:47;50:49;"- The first album's good."
50:49;50:50;"- You like the first album?"
50:50;50:51;"- The first album?"
50:51;50:52;"- Yeah."
50:52;50:53;"- Interesting."
50:53;50:54;"- Yeah."
50:54;50:55;"- Do you know the song ""Eyes of the World""?"
50:55;50:59;"- I feel like you might like ""Eyes of the World"" because it's like, it's very un-country."
50:59;51:05;"- Don't even want to, I don't hate country, but it's just too, they need to like wake"
51:05;51:06;"up."
51:06;51:09;"- That's one of the, a very perceptive answer to that question."
51:09;51:13;"It's one of the more interesting answers I've had is because in the US, because of course"
51:13;51:17;"the dead is hugely influenced by country and that's such a, they literally cover country"
51:17;51:20;"songs and even in a lot of what they did, there's a country influence."
51:20;51:23;"In the US, when you ask people that question, do you like the dead?"
51:23;51:27;"People might say, ""I don't like that psychedelic drug stuff, whatever."""
51:27;51:31;"But I've never heard anybody say, I'm not into the country element even, but you're"
51:31;51:32;"very right."
51:32;51:33;"That's a huge part of it."
51:33;51:34;"- Yeah."
51:34;51:35;"Yeah."
51:35;51:37;"I mean, I like what they represent."
51:37;51:42;"What they represent is f***ing cool, but I think Modest Mouse represent the same thing,"
51:42;51:45;"but in a new century kind of way."
51:45;51:46;"- That's interesting."
51:46;51:50;"- I mean, that is the highest compliment I can pay to the Grateful Dead."
51:50;51:51;"- Interesting."
51:51;51:52;"Tell us more about that."
51:52;51:55;"What's the connection between Modest Mouse and the dead?"
51:55;51:58;"- Well, I got the impression that, because I've got some friends, American friends who"
51:58;52:01;"really love the dead, right?"
52:01;52:05;"Believing Jerry Garcia being of them."
52:05;52:10;"They like that the dead are a big band and they got no problem going and watching in"
52:10;52:15;"large numbers, which is a really cool thing I think about Americans."
52:15;52:17;"They're not kind of so precious about it."
52:17;52:18;"They will share that band."
52:18;52:24;"But I heard this when I was in Modest Mouse, that there was a thing about the dead where"
52:24;52:26;"they had a room full of phones."
52:26;52:30;"And if you wanted to find out where they were playing, you would have to phone some, you"
52:30;52:32;"would have to try and phone them up."
52:32;52:33;"- Yeah, that sounds right."
52:33;52:36;"Because they were pioneers of like how to connect with the fans and they had their own"
52:36;52:37;"office."
52:37;52:38;"Yeah, that makes sense."
52:38;52:43;"- They played when they f***ing wanted, where they f***ing wanted."
52:43;52:45;"And the audience knew that."
52:45;52:50;"You feel like the independent spirit of doing what you want, connecting directly with fans,"
52:50;52:53;"you see that spirit alive in Modest Mouse."
52:53;52:54;"- Absolutely, yeah."
52:54;52:58;"I learned a lot being in Modest Mouse."
52:58;53:04;"I learned a lot about American culture, which was fascinating to me because I'd been already"
53:04;53:07;"a professional musician for a long time by then."
53:07;53:10;"And I always say it was like one of the best times of my life."
53:10;53:14;"And I'm not being, you know, sentimental when I say that."
53:14;53:20;"But that audience, I mean, for a start, some of the shows we played were just really transcendent."
53:20;53:25;"And then you just didn't know how it was going to go from night to night, which is another"
53:25;53:28;"thing that reminds me of what I've heard about."
53:28;53:31;"We used to play long shows."
53:31;53:33;"I really liked playing to that audience."
53:33;53:37;"I learned so much, you know, like the way skate culture has informed rock music."
53:37;53:38;"I learned all about that."
53:38;53:39;"I didn't know about that."
53:39;53:42;"I didn't know about, didn't know that straight edge was a thing."
53:42;53:48;"I didn't know that straight edge was what really went progressively, you know, and about"
53:48;53:50;"what I then took on board."
53:50;53:51;"Oh, okay."
53:51;53:55;"When Americans say punk rock, it really means something."
53:55;53:59;"And it means something when my generation of British people used to say punk rock, but"
53:59;54:00;"it meant something slightly different."
54:00;54:06;"But so, yeah, I found out quite a lot playing in front of Modest Mouse, because, you know,"
54:06;54:11;"I'd never been in a band with like a standup bass or a lap steel, you know, we're playing"
54:11;54:16;"these badass f***ing riffs that were almost like, sometimes I was like, we sound like"
54:16;54:19;"the birthday party, but there's a banjo going on."
54:19;54:21;"What the f*** is that?"
54:21;54:22;"Yeah."
54:22;54:23;"And the subject matter."
54:23;54:24;"Oh, man."
54:24;54:27;"Great band, and needed great work and Modest Mouse."
54:43;55:03;"[applause]"
55:27;55:33;"When you joined Modest Mouse, you had a family, and your whole family moved from Manchester"
55:33;55:35;"to Portland for five years."
55:35;55:36;"That's how it went down?"
55:36;55:41;"Well, no, my kids had to keep traveling back and forwards, and they missed quite a lot."
55:41;55:44;"That's the longest I've spent away from my family."
55:44;55:47;"I've been with my wife since we were 15."
55:47;55:49;"They just got on board every opportunity they came over."
55:49;55:52;"So you also probably went back and forth."
55:52;55:54;"So, but you were kind of based in Portland."
55:54;56:00;"I went back very rarely because our tours, we seemed to like it wasn't worth it."
56:00;56:03;"Because when we took a break, that band toured so much."
56:03;56:05;"The longest time I had off, I remember, was like 10 days."
56:05;56:07;"There's no point going back."
56:07;56:09;"And was that the most you toured in your life?"
56:09;56:11;"Like the Smiths ever toured that hard?"
56:11;56:12;"No."
56:12;56:13;"The The toured that hard."
56:13;56:14;"Oh, yeah, right."
56:14;56:15;"The The."
56:15;56:16;"Yeah."
56:16;56:18;"And how did you find it living in Portland?"
56:18;56:23;"And also, I just want to also, I'm just curious, in your entire life, you've either lived in"
56:23;56:27;"Manchester or this period in Portland, like you never moved to London or anything?"
56:27;56:29;"Oh, no, I've lived in London a bunch."
56:29;56:30;"Oh, you've lived in London a bunch."
56:30;56:34;"In the Smiths days, on and off, we'd live in London, but my main house was in Manchester."
56:34;56:39;"And then I like I rented twice, staying in Kirsten McColl's flat quite a lot."
56:39;56:44;"And we'd have so we'd go through periods where we'd be London based, but I would always be"
56:44;56:45;"jumping in my car."
56:45;56:48;"Matej was my school buddy, and he loved driving."
56:48;56:52;"And you would just you know what it's like in the UK, you just get in the car and two"
56:52;56:55;"and a half hours later, we'd just be driving up and down the motorway."
56:55;57:00;"And I'd have my feet on the dashboard with my buddy driving and smoking spliffs and listening"
57:00;57:05;"to Velvet Underground and Everly Brothers and stuff like that, Benny King."
57:05;57:09;"But Portland, was Portland the only time you you really lived outside of the UK?"
57:09;57:10;"Yeah."
57:10;57:14;"So how did you find your whole this whole American experience?"
57:14;57:18;"It was amazing bit of I don't know whether it's synchronicity or what, because early"
57:18;57:24;"2000s in the UK, I just it might be my age or where I was at, but I didn't like rock"
57:24;57:27;"music that was happening in the UK."
57:27;57:30;"Everything was like a very, as I remember it, everyone was just trying to do a sort"
57:30;57:34;"of very pale version of OK Computer."
57:34;57:38;"And there was a lot of the start of this acoustic troubadour thing that was going on."
57:38;57:43;"And the guitar music that was interesting was Jeff Buckley."
57:43;57:48;"But I met Elliot Smith in late 90s."
57:48;57:50;"Elliot was on his like second album there I think."
57:50;57:52;"And he told me about Portland."
57:52;57:57;"And around about the same time, maybe because I was listening to Elliot, I got into, well"
57:57;58:01;"maybe Elliot turned me on to Built to Spill."
58:01;58:05;"But the big thing was that Broken Social Scene came out."
58:05;58:09;"So I suddenly was like, oh, I'm saved."
58:09;58:10;"Guitar music is alive and well."
58:10;58:15;"It's Doug Marsh and it's Elliot and it's Kevin Drew."
58:15;58:18;"And I loved the Lillies."
58:18;58:19;"Kurt Heasley."
58:19;58:21;"Kurt Heasley, man, I thought the Lillies were really fun."
58:21;58:23;"I don't know them very well."
58:23;58:26;"I think they're from out of Massachusetts or Boston or something."
58:26;58:28;"So I loved all of that."
58:28;58:30;"But I kept hearing about Modest Mouse."
58:30;58:32;"So it's like all roads led to Modest Mouse."
58:32;58:36;"Someone, I don't know, I heard a long time Crowded West on a tour bus and I thought this"
58:36;58:37;"is really interesting."
58:37;58:40;"And then, Antarctica."
58:40;58:44;"So I was really swimming in all of that music that was kind of saving me, American music."
58:44;58:46;"I didn't like what was going on in the UK."
58:46;58:51;"And I got out of the blue, Isaac Brock called me up and literally asked me to join the band."
58:51;58:52;"And I was like, I don't know."
58:52;58:54;"You never met before?"
58:54;58:55;"I didn't even know him."
58:55;58:56;"He asked me to join the band."
58:56;58:57;"Yeah."
58:57;58:58;"And that was really, really funny."
58:58;59:01;"I thought I was really funny."
59:01;59:07;"And I reverted to the person that I was when I was 14 when bands used to say, my friend"
59:07;59:09;"used to say, well, that band want you to join."
59:09;59:12;"And they live, you know, they want you."
59:12;59:16;"And I was like, well, that might make they sound interesting."
59:16;59:20;"So there wasn't any great, you know, it wasn't like me and a management company sitting there"
59:20;59:24;"and a record company going, hey, Johnny Mara, Modest Mouse, we'll do this, you know, I just"
59:24;59:26;"thought, okay, I'll head over there."
59:26;59:28;"We'll have a 10 day experiment."
59:28;59:31;"We got together in the first night, we stayed up real late."
59:31;59:35;"And we wrote a few, me and Isaac just jammed and we wrote a few songs the very first night"
59:35;59:37;"and then we were off then."
59:37;59:43;"Each day, another person would arrive with an instrument."
59:43;59:47;"Another drummer would arrive, someone with a bass, someone with a flute, someone with"
59:47;59:48;"an accordion."
59:48;59:50;"I'm like, what the f***?"
59:50;59:54;"And then about five days in, we were jamming and everyone has assembled this really interesting"
59:54;59:59;"bunch of people that I really took to, we got really tight straight away."
59:59;01:00:00;"And you know what?"
01:00:00;01:00:03;"I was stood there in the afternoon one and we were jamming, we'd been writing really,"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"we really inspired these tunes were coming out."
01:00:06;01:00:11;"Mostly me and Isaac were starting these tunes and everyone was joining in and it was happening."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"I stood down, I went, you know what?"
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I've come over, I still am none the wiser."
01:00:16;01:00:22;"I don't know what this music is, but I f***ing feel really good."
01:00:22;01:00:27;"And that reminded me of, you know, when you're a youngster and you're in a band and you don't"
01:00:27;01:00:32;"know enough to be like, oh, okay, this is like an Havana riff or this is like, you're"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"just doing it and it just feels great."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"I was in my forties."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"I went, how did that happen?"
01:00:37;01:00:42;"I'm stood in a room with these really cool people I really like, and I have no idea what"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"it is we're doing, but it feels really good."
01:00:44;01:00:48;"So I was like, well, that's a good, great reason to stay."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"And I fell in love with Port."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"I love the city, you know."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Yeah."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"You just enjoyed being there."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Early 2000s Portland."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Yeah."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"I was living there."
01:00:57;01:01:00;"I guess like, oh yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I remember hearing..."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Johnny Marr crossover."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"I remember living, I was living in Portland."
01:01:04;01:01:10;"I remember hearing Johnny Marr moved to town and I was like, wow, that's far out."
01:01:10;01:01:14;"Man, I was running around there cause I was super into running and I'd be running around"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"all in the mornings."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I was jet lagged, always jet lagged."
01:01:17;01:01:21;"Cause for the first few visits I was coming back and then going back."
01:01:21;01:01:25;"Running around looking at, I was just like, I love this place."
01:01:25;01:01:29;"And I think, you know, Portlandia, you know, when Fred and Karen, you know, that when that"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"first came out, that was pretty much a documentary."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"That was exactly what Portland was."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Yeah."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"That was the Portland that you knew."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"It was like reality TV."
01:01:38;01:01:44;"While we're on the subject, could we change the subject now?"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"I was knocking on your ears, don't you?"
01:01:47;01:01:51;"You were always out looking towards the future."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"We were begging for the past."
01:01:53;01:01:58;"Well, we know we had the good things, but those never seemed to last."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Oh, please just last."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Everyone's unhappy."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"Everyone's ashamed."
01:02:11;01:02:16;"Well, we all just got caught looking at somebody else's page."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Well, nothing ever went quite exactly as we planned."
01:02:20;01:02:25;"Our ideas held no water, but we used them like a dam."
01:02:25;01:02:31;"Oh, and we carried it all so well."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"As if we got a new position."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"Oh, I'm not."
01:02:38;01:02:44;"Yes, it's fine."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"Oh, I'm not."
01:02:47;01:02:51;"How do you brought up running?"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"I just have one question."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"So last night, so I know you're an avid runner."
01:02:55;01:02:59;"You know, I think some of us on on this show are as well."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Last night we're talking."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"I know you did the marathon."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"Do you still do long runs at the moment?"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"No, because I'm promoting, you know, when you it's no, I don't."
01:03:07;01:03:10;"I do 15 miles, something like that."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"That's a long one for me now."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"When you do a long run like that, I would say that's a long run for anybody."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"When you do that, do you listen to music?"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:17;01:03:21;"You don't go natural just in your head."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"All right."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"That's how Jake does."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"I'm listening to music."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"Jake just goes, he's in his head."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"I go silence."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"I'm really impressed with that."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"I'd love it."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"That's so great."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"I'm not running 15 miles."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"I'm running three, four, five miles."
01:03:38;01:03:45;"And I just I'm surrounded by media and crap all day that I, if I'm going to run for whatever,"
01:03:45;01:03:50;"half hour, 40 minutes, I like to have silence and just be with my thoughts and see what happens."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"But that's just me."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"That's great."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Yeah."
01:03:53;01:03:59;"I mean, if I do 15, 15 is the longest I will do now, but regularly I'll do whatever 12K,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"10, 12K a few times a week."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"Nothing like I was doing."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"I was f****** Forrest Gump."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"I was like running 18 miles before a show, man."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"And you always would listen to music when you run?"
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Always listen to music."
01:04:11;01:04:15;"And so much of my solo stuff, but not so much this new album."
01:04:15;01:04:21;"But the first couple of albums I did, the solo stuff, the tempos are so up because I was getting up."
01:04:21;01:04:25;"Here's when I was running, you know, I was like, listen to a load of like Fad Gadget and all this."
01:04:25;01:04:31;"So, you know, like, but the first time, you know, I was up in my running and up in my running, up in my running."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"First went Modest Mouse, we got them for REM."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"It was the first time I'd ever run like 10 or 12 miles or whatever before a show."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"I thought, this is great."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"I walked out on stage."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"It's like I was vibrating."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"I got about halfway through the third song and I was like, I ain't going to make it to this, the end of the show."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"I'm f******."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Oh, damn."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Too much running?"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"But then fast forward a couple of years, man."
01:04:53;01:05:01;"I was running in the snow in the gig traffic against the traffic in like, is it Minneapolis?"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"That's Catoon and a lot like, oh, yeah."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:05;01:05:13;"Like, if there's nowhere to go in these arenas, I just run right around the area of the arena in piles of snow."
01:05:13;01:05:17;"Just with the traffic coming towards me, just I was crazed."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"It was amazing."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Wow."
01:05:19;01:05:23;"And you felt so good physically, mentally."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Yeah, it was amazing."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Is there a spiritual aspect to running long distances?"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"I think so, yeah."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Because it just takes you out of your head."
01:05:31;01:05:35;"It depends what you believe is the alternative to being in your head."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Interesting."
01:05:36;01:05:41;"I've heard this, never experienced it, but maybe one day."
01:05:41;01:05:46;"I like to think about people stuck in traffic getting into the arena and they're just like, was that Johnny Marr?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"I don't know."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Some dude just ran by the car."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"In like a shorts and a t-shirt."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Right."
01:05:52;01:05:59;"Yeah, well, I used to run, when I used to run around Portland, I was like, okay, depending on time of day, I'd have this stupid stripey beanie on."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Okay."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"And I was like, oh, I'm all cool."
01:06:01;01:06:07;"And Isaac just said to me, he said, you know, people just keep telling me that they keep seeing you with a stupid hat on."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"I was like, okay."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"So you switched it out?"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"No, I made it a thing."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Oh, that was your thing."
01:07:27;01:07:37;"Okay, this is just another question I had when you're talking about touring with REM."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"Are you and Peter Buck boys?"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Do you have a relationship?"
01:07:40;01:07:48;"Because I always felt this thing like in the 80s, REM and the Smiths seemed to have so much in common and you guys as guitarists."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Yeah."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"Did you have a connection in that era?"
01:07:51;01:07:57;"Not in that era, although they came to a show, I think it was New York or something and we didn't get to meet up."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"I think I got stoned and forgot or something."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"And that's quite likely, right?"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"But really, we obviously super respect to them."
01:08:06;01:08:12;"And then I guess sometime in the late 90s or mid 90s, I went to see Peter play with Robin Hitchcock."
01:08:12;01:08:16;"And I think we maybe even said, why aren't we buds?"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"You know, like this is, yeah."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"Didn't we be like pals?"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And, you know, it was amazing."
01:08:21;01:08:24;"This was the really early days of iPods."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"They were a luxury item back then."
01:08:26;01:08:34;"He gave me an iPod completely filled with music that he thought I would not have heard on that I would like."
01:08:34;01:08:37;"And it was such a cool gift."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"It was so great."
01:08:38;01:08:39;"And he was right."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"It was music that you hadn't heard and you did like."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Nearly entirely."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"Do you remember what kind of stuff?"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"Anything that jumps out to you from that?"
01:08:47;01:08:54;"Well, you know, it was a lot of kind of like, because believe it or not, I had a real blind spot for like Alex Chilton and stuff like that."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"And he turned me on to a lot of that."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"There was a lot of good country stuff."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"There was a lot of Hank Williams."
01:08:58;01:09:03;"There was a lot of garage psychedelic stuff that you would expect, really."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"I think Townes Van Zandt was, God, I love country."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"Just realized."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"I think Townes Van Zandt was on."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"Yeah, you should check out The Grateful Dead."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Yeah, I don't think so."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"Townes Van Zandt, amazing."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Absolutely."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"I think it was a little bit like the Nas were on there."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"He turned me on to that."
01:09:18;01:09:24;"But, I think Peter then, he then moved to Portland when I was there."
01:09:24;01:09:30;"So we hung out a bit and that was before, and then Modest Mouse weren't on a tour then with REM."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"And then the answer is, of course we get along."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"We're f***ing now."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"We've got so much in common."
01:09:36;01:09:46;"And the first show that we were playing that Modest Mouse played on that, I think it was called Accelerator or whatever their album was then, 2008, 9."
01:09:46;01:09:49;"He came into the dressing room, say hello."
01:09:49;01:09:53;"And he happened to have the set list in his hand, REM set list, and a Sharpie."
01:09:53;01:09:56;"And he was talking to me and I just grabbed the Sharpie out of his hand."
01:09:56;01:10:01;"I grabbed the set list and I wrote Fall On Me in the encore."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"And he said, if you play it."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"So I was kind of like, sure, sure."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"Okay, I've got this."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Okay."
01:10:08;01:10:17;"So each night I'll play Fall On Me and then that added then something else added then we got like maybe Man On The Moon or a couple of other songs."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"So I would play that in the encore with him."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"And that was great."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"The two of us playing Rickenbackers."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Cool cat."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Oh, wow."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"I got to look that up."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"I've got some videos or audio of those shows."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"There's a problem that there's iron"
01:10:31;01:10:35;"Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys"
01:10:35;01:10:43;"Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air"
01:10:43;01:10:51;"Find the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky"
01:10:51;01:11:05;"Fall On Me"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"What are you doing the rest of the year?"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Are you going on tour now?"
01:11:09;01:11:18;"Yeah, we're about to go on tour with Blondie doing an arena tour in the UK, which is going to be cool."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"Because I wrote a song on their last record for him."
01:11:21;01:11:25;"That was really cool to be asked to come up with a song for them."
01:11:25;01:11:30;"And then I believe that just finishing off a new record that may or may not have one of my songs on."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"So that's really gratifying."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"And we're doing that."
01:11:35;01:11:40;"And then we're doing some other gigs in around Europe in the summer."
01:11:40;01:11:46;"Paris and whatever, some gigs in Germany and then Milan."
01:11:46;01:11:51;"And then we're going out around stadiums with the Killers in September and October."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"In Europe?"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"No, that's around the States. That's all over the place."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"Oh, awesome."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"That's like 30 shows. Yeah, which will be fun."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Are you guys coming to LA?"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"Believe it or not, I don't think we are."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"I don't think I'm doing the LA shows for some reason."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"That's a strange thing. We're doing lots of other places."
01:12:06;01:12:11;"I'm like, even back in the Smith days, right? I get on the tour bus."
01:12:11;01:12:15;"I would not know where I would not want to know where I was going."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"Now I'm definitely grown up."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"And I don't know where I'm going. And I don't care."
01:12:22;01:12:26;"No, I feel you just like at a certain point, like, just stay focused on the show."
01:12:26;01:12:30;"Hang around the venue. Try to go to art museum."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"Try some artisanal coffee. It's just going to stress you out."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"Just like, just stay there."
01:12:36;01:12:40;"As long as the shows are great and I can hopefully maybe get a run in"
01:12:40;01:12:44;"and there's no dramas, my band are all happy."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"I really love that thing. I'm sure this won't be lost on you."
01:12:48;01:12:52;"That is one of the greatest things when you, you know, when you're on the road"
01:12:52;01:12:57;"and you don't know what day it is and you often don't know what month it is."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"And you don't know what town you're in."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"To me, it's like, what a job. That's amazing."
01:13:03;01:13:07;"Yeah, I like that you frame that positively because you definitely hear the other school of thought"
01:13:07;01:13:11;"where people are just like, I don't even know where I was. I was losing it."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"But I think you're right. It can be a positive thing."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"It's like you're connecting with the eternal. Doesn't matter where you are."
01:13:18;01:13:23;"Oh, it's amazing. When people say that, I'm like, hey, listen, mate, buddy,"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"soon enough, you're going to know it's a wet Wednesday in Liverpool."
01:13:27;01:13:33;"Don't worry about it. That orientation, it will come back."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"Enjoy that. You don't know what month it is."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"You don't know what day of the week it is. That's pretty cool."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"I love that. Yeah. The first time that happened, whenever it happens, I'm like,"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"this is great, man. How did I get to do this? Really cool."
01:13:47;01:13:51;"That's a great way to frame it. Well, I think that's a great note to end on."
01:13:51;01:13:55;"It's been amazing talking to you. You essentially have two new albums,"
01:13:55;01:13:59;"which everybody should check out. How do you frame it as two albums or one?"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"It's one double album called Fever Dreams."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"One double album."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Yeah, it's called Fever Dreams Parts 1 to 4."
01:14:05;01:14:10;"And what happened was I just really like, I had the title before I wrote one song,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"right? Or maybe I had a couple of songs on the go. And I was just like,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Fever Dreams Parts 1 to 4 is like a nice title."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"And I didn't want to just call it Fever Dreams. And then I was like, well,"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"what's this 1 to 4 about? You better kind of work something out about that."
01:14:23;01:14:27;"So I came up with this, it's great. Artistic lateral thinking,"
01:14:27;01:14:31;"which you guys will know about. It created, it gave me a conundrum,"
01:14:31;01:14:35;"creative conundrums of what is that? So I then was like, well,"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"if the label are cool with it, this Parts 1 to 4,"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"the album is a double album,"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"but I'll release the first few parts leading up to it."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"And then the album can be, then it can be this four part thing."
01:14:46;01:14:51;"And of course the label thought I was this marketing genius coming up with this"
01:14:51;01:14:55;"concept. And it was just simply because I didn't want to lose the Parts 1 to 4"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"bit of the album. And, but also it gave me a,"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"then it gave me a sort of thing where these whiteboards and I was like, oh,"
01:15:01;01:15:05;"that can be Part 1 and that song, oh, I've got two that are a little light there."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"I'll move that and lyrically that'll be good."
01:15:07;01:15:12;"And it's just a really fun kind of artistic kind of premise, really."
01:15:12;01:15:16;"That just came out of something quite abstract. So yeah,"
01:15:16;01:15:20;"but it is a double album. I mean, that's because I went into it knowing,"
01:15:20;01:15:23;"because of the title, I was like, well, that sounds like a double album."
01:15:23;01:15:26;"Then I realised that I've never been in a band that I've ever done a double album,"
01:15:26;01:15:30;"a proper double album before. And that made me think, oh, double album,"
01:15:30;01:15:34;"maybe some intros can be kind of long and maybe I can put a few solos on there"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"and gave me this feeling of being expansive."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"And you know the way your mind works on this sort of stuff."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"Cause up until now,"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"I've been pretty hell bent on making the first three records really kind of"
01:15:45;01:15:50;"kicking and super talented and sort of like a kind of, I don't know what you call it,"
01:15:50;01:15:54;"art rock kind of thing. But this, this is a bit more kind of open."
01:15:54;01:15:57;"- Absolutely. I love that, that way of thinking."
01:15:57;01:16:01;"And also to have that concept and then meet the concepts,"
01:16:01;01:16:05;"figure out how you can work within it. Well, yeah. Amazing talking to you."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"- Thank you."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"- You're an awesome dude. Awesome musician."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"Everybody check out Fever Dreams one through four,"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"see Johnny Marr on tour and check out the movie Colours."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"If you've never seen it, at least the opening scene."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"- Thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it. It's an unusual cast."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"- No, well, yeah. We hope you'll come back. Love to talk to you again."
01:16:23;01:16:27;"And I truly, I might try to reach out to Herbie Hancock."
01:16:27;01:16:32;"I would love to hear some of the extended jams from the Colours soundtrack."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"That sounds incredible."
01:16:34;01:16:38;"And we are going to make a little playlist for you of non-country Grateful Dead."
01:16:38;01:16:41;"And if you listen, if you don't like it, just don't even write back."
01:16:41;01:16:45;"I really think there's moments of Jerry's playing that you might connect with."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"- Sure."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- We're going to send it on a old iPod."
01:16:48;01:16:53;"- That's perfect. That sounds good."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"Thanks, Gellert. You're in the UK, man. Lock me up."
01:16:56;01:16:59;"- Oh, absolutely. I'd love to. Thanks so much."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"Thanks for coming on, Johnny. All right. We'll talk to you soon."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"- Thank you, Johnny."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- Guys, take care."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"- Bye."
01:17:05;01:17:13;"Talking with my shadow, escape the sensory."
01:17:13;01:17:21;"Some other day, tomorrow, tomorrow endlessly."
01:17:21;01:17:30;"Switching through my channel, I'm a real machine."
01:17:30;01:17:55;"Calling me to follow a detour memory."
01:17:55;01:18:03;"Running through the static, just how I need to be."
01:18:03;01:18:11;"Future days, tomorrow, call my history."
01:18:11;01:18:19;"Look through every window, walk through any door."
01:18:19;01:18:26;"Now don't you know I never saw the world so clear before."
01:18:26;01:18:43;"In these days, life is a perfect start."
01:18:43;01:18:58;"In these days, holding on for some run."
01:18:58;01:19:26;"Thinking with my shadow, I heard it calling me."
01:19:26;01:19:34;"We will find tomorrow, somewhere where we can be."
01:19:34;01:19:42;"Walking through the static, dreaming endlessly."
01:19:42;01:19:49;"Another way tomorrow, leaving the sensory."
01:19:49;01:20:05;"In these days, life is a perfect start."
01:20:05;01:20:22;"In these days, holding on for some run."
01:20:22;01:20:38;"In these days."
01:20:38;01:20:46;"In these days."
01:20:46;01:21:13;"In these days."
01:21:13;01:21:17;"Thank you to Johnny Marr. That's, I think that's one of the best guests we ever had."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"I mean, yeah, I try to keep it in check. I'm such a fan."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"I'm gonna go back and listen to all of his work again."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"I loved how guitar intensive the convo was."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"I don't know how many guitarists we've had on this show."
01:21:30;01:21:34;"And I always say like, oh, I don't really care about guitars that much or gear."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"But truly, if you had asked me like years ago,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"who's a guitarist you'd like to talk to and what question would you ask them?"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"I really would have said, I'd like to talk to Johnny Marr."
01:21:44;01:21:48;"And I want to know exactly what he was listening to when he was like 18, 19."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And wrote this charming man specifically."
01:21:50;01:21:54;"Because it really, there wouldn't be a punk without this charming man."
01:21:54;01:21:57;"Like I learned it's like, dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"And then I was like, dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"I've never thought of the vampire Johnny Marr connection."
01:22:04;01:22:07;"But now that you mentioned it, it's, it's fully there."
01:22:07;01:22:12;"And I've never done, and we've never done at least so far in our careers,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"a lot of what I think people associate with him,"
01:22:14;01:22:18;"which is his kind of like arpeggiated dung like stuff."
01:22:18;01:22:24;"But he does, he has those moments up on the high strings of that kind of like movement."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"That, yeah, I mean, I love him."
01:22:27;01:22:31;"And then we didn't even get into like, how soon is now probably like,"
01:22:31;01:22:35;"one of the most iconic, fascinating, weird guitar sounds"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"that nobody knows how to recreate."
01:22:37;01:22:43;"Although now you can find like deep analyses of like how they did the dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"Yeah, he's a dude who can kind of do anything."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Anyway, thank you to Johnny Marr."
01:22:49;01:22:55;"Before we get into the top five, we have a little bit of a food business to take care of."
01:22:55;01:22:58;"We should have kept Johnny Marr on the phone because I could have asked him about this."
01:22:58;01:23:04;"We have a new product in our possession from the Goldfish brand."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"Now Goldfish, we haven't talked about Goldfish in a long time on TC."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"We're now joined by Seinfeld."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"Hey, what's up?"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"He missed the first half of the show because he was actually,"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"he was hanging out with his friend Morrissey"
01:23:17;01:23:20;"and he couldn't come through for the Johnny Marr interview."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"Not allowed to talk about Johnny Marr."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"He was in great spirits, by the way. He's doing great."
01:23:25;01:23:30;"He's got a whole new lease on life."
01:23:30;01:23:33;"So we used to talk about Goldfish on the show."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"We did the Goldfish Challenge."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Would you remind everyone?"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Actually, Seinfeld, what is the Goldfish Challenge?"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"It's about hummus?"
01:23:39;01:23:43;"Yeah, so actually it's timely because the Super Bowl is coming up with..."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Oh, perfect."
01:23:44;01:23:50;"Yeah, Dr. Dre, the idea of the Goldfish and Hummus Challenge was that at your next Super Bowl party,"
01:23:50;01:23:57;"leave out a dish of Goldfish and a bowl of hummus to dip it in and don't acknowledge it."
01:23:57;01:24:00;"And just see, it's like a social experiment, see what happens at the party."
01:24:00;01:24:05;"And it's really interesting because the whole premise of this psychological experiment,"
01:24:05;01:24:12;"the Goldfish Challenge, which we developed with some really high-level clinical psychologists at Harvard."
01:24:12;01:24:16;"One of them was also at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."
01:24:16;01:24:22;"But the reason we developed this is because what was interesting about it is that Goldfish is a little bit too small"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"to properly scoop a dip with."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"It's not impossible, but it's a little bit too small."
01:24:27;01:24:32;"And you learn a lot about human nature based on whether or not people will say anything"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"or whether they'll get annoyed by getting some of the dip on their fingers."
01:24:35;01:24:44;"But I guess a lot of our work is kind of less relevant these days because Goldfish have introduced a new product called Megabytes."
01:24:44;01:24:49;"And Megabytes, it's also interesting because I think we first started talking about Goldfish"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"because we said, ""Are Goldfish for children?"""
01:24:51;01:24:55;"And my take was that Goldfish clearly had become a children's snack."
01:24:55;01:24:59;"Although I looked it up recently, maybe we talked about this back in the day."
01:24:59;01:25:07;"When Goldfish first came out, I think in the '60s, they were framed as a kind of sophisticated adult snack to have at cocktail parties."
01:25:07;01:25:11;"But over the years, they became a children's snack."
01:25:11;01:25:17;"And now Goldfish is introducing Goldfish Megabytes, which are larger, so much easier to dip."
01:25:17;01:25:22;"And they're also more sophisticated flavors for more of a grown-up palate."
01:25:22;01:25:27;"People in the 70-plus crowd, people who are unambiguously older."
01:25:27;01:25:34;"And the two flavors they've unleashed on the world so far are sharp cheddar and cheddar jalapeno."
01:25:34;01:25:39;"Yeah, you're not going to find a lot of five-year-olds asking their parents for sharp cheddar and cheddar jalapeno."
01:25:39;01:25:48;"We were going to talk about this on the last show, but everybody's Goldfish Megabytes arrived just after we taped the last show."
01:25:48;01:25:58;"So it put the whole Crisis crew in a real crisis in that we received the Megabytes, and we had just about two weeks we had to wait to eat them on air."
01:25:58;01:26:04;"And there was a lot of discussion on the group chat about how waiting to eat these Goldfish was friggin' torture."
01:26:04;01:26:08;"Because normally, somebody sends a great snack to your house, first thing you want to do is eat it."
01:26:08;01:26:14;"It's a very unusual situation that you have to wait two weeks before you can even touch it."
01:26:14;01:26:20;"And I know for all of us, we've been so excited to try this snack, and it was friggin' torture not to be able to eat it."
01:26:20;01:26:29;"So I put mine way in the back of the pantry, and of course I didn't want my family to see it, because I think if any member of my family saw it, they'd be gone."
01:26:29;01:26:32;"And I'd have to explain, ""No guys, this is for my work."""
01:26:32;01:26:37;"I had to put mine on the top shelf so my son couldn't reach it, because these are for adults."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"It would also just be inappropriate for a child to... it's a big boy snack."
01:26:41;01:26:47;"I want to say about, and I don't want to put this off any longer because I'm hungry and I'm desperate to eat these."
01:26:47;01:26:52;"But Pepperidge Farm claims that 40% of Goldfish are eaten by adults."
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Like this is... however..."
01:26:54;01:26:55;"Wait, really?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Yes."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"I didn't know that."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Yes."
01:26:58;01:27:05;"And the CMO of Campbell Snacks, the parent company to Pepperidge Farm said,"
01:27:05;01:27:12;"""This is the first time Goldfish has created a snacking experience specifically with grown-up tastes in mind."""
01:27:12;01:27:16;"So it does feel like at some level they are recognizing it's a child snack."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"I thought originally they were for adults."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"Well, yeah, clearly it's become a child snack."
01:27:22;01:27:31;"Also, like, imagining a Goldfish-obsessed household where at all times you have to have both traditional Goldfish for the children and then Megabytes for the
grown-ups,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"and the twain shall never meet."
01:27:33;01:27:39;"That'd be a cool Super Bowl party, just like invite some families over and just be like,"
01:27:39;01:27:43;"""Alright, now these ones are for the kids only, and for the grown-ups don't worry, I got you."""
01:27:43;01:27:46;"And bring out the bowl of Megabytes, the cheddar jalapeno."
01:27:46;01:27:51;"Alright, well let's get into it because we've been torturing ourselves long enough."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"Gentlemen."
01:27:54;01:28:01;"Can I just acknowledge, can I just say that they have this, does this happen on all Goldfish packages with this classy Goldfish sticker?"
01:28:01;01:28:06;"No, it's got a cool little, that looks like something you'd get at like a hipster coffee shop."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"So already the adult sort of focused marketing is in full effect here."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"Okay."
01:28:11;01:28:19;"Did they make the individual Goldfish bigger for like scooping purposes?"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"They're like twice as big."
01:28:21;01:28:25;"You know what, honestly, the fact that the Goldfish is bigger makes it more childish to me."
01:28:25;01:28:30;"This looks like even more of like a big goofy kid snack, the big fish."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"I just grabbed a ruler, I want to measure these."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Oh yeah, what are the..."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"Wait, are you doing sharp cheddar or the jalapeno?"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"I'm doing the jalapeno."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"I did jalapeno."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"These are clocking in at an inch and a quarter."
01:28:44;01:28:49;"I want to say, I don't remember the last time I had, I mean it has to be fairly recently,"
01:28:49;01:28:54;"but the sharp cheddar tastes exactly like normal Goldfish."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"I couldn't tell you the difference."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Cheddar jalapeno has a bit of a kick."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Oh, okay. The jalapeno has a little bit."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"It has a little bit of a kick."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"It lingers."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"Yep, that's a big boy snack."
01:29:06;01:29:08;"That's a big boy snack."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"I'd love to crush these with a beer."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I would dip these in some hummus."
01:29:13;01:29:16;"Oh yeah, I agree. Sharp cheddar tastes exactly like regular Goldfish."
01:29:16;01:29:19;"I'm feeling these cheddar jalapenos. These are good."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"An amazing climax to a two-week story."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Would you buy these a regular Goldfish?"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"I mean, honestly, I'm not buying either."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"I mean, I guess if I was having a Super Bowl party,"
01:29:30;01:29:35;"and maybe I will have a Super Bowl party because I have a great snack to share,"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I would buy these over it."
01:29:37;01:29:40;"And I would say, okay, the kids probably shouldn't have the cheddar jalapeno."
01:29:40;01:29:46;"It's got a bit of a kick, but the sharp cheddar, the adults and the kids can both enjoy."
01:29:46;01:29:51;"I like the idea of you having a Super Bowl party solely to show off your snack."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"People definitely do that."
01:29:53;01:29:58;"I do miss, and again, I only would eat Goldfish at like a kid's party,"
01:29:58;01:30:03;"but there's something about the handful of like the small Goldfish"
01:30:03;01:30:08;"that's more rewarding, that's almost more satisfying than these."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"No. I'm a convert."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"You don't agree? You don't agree?"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Counterpoint. No."
01:30:15;01:30:20;"I got to call out the, these are actually not unhealthy."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"They're healthier than one would think."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"No sugar, relatively low fat, high sodium, but not that bad."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"22 pieces a serving."
01:30:29;01:30:33;"Eating 22 of these feels like a lot."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"Right? And yet if you ate 22 of these,"
01:30:36;01:30:42;"you'd be getting three grams of protein and only 9% of your daily fat intake."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Not bad."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"Do you know where Pepperidge Farm Inc. is based?"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Norwalk, Connecticut."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"Connecticut's pulling its weight in the snack game."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"All right, let's get into the top five."
01:30:55;01:31:02;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:31:02;01:31:05;"This week, we're going to bang this out."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"We're just doing 2003."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Why 2003?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"I have a feeling. I'm not totally sure."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Great question. I don't know."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Is that the year Johnny Marr moved to Portland?"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Maybe it is. It's the year I left Portland."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"I think Johnny and I had a six-month crossover in Portland."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Did you ever spot him?"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"No, I don't think I would have recognized him."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Especially in his beanie?"
01:31:26;01:31:30;"2003 is the year that Johnny released his first solo album."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Interesting. So was that the same time he was playing in Modest Mouse?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Or was he done with Modest Mouse by then?"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"No, I think Modest Mouse was after that."
01:31:38;01:31:44;"I saw Modest Mouse play a lot in, I don't know, '99, 2000."
01:31:44;01:31:48;"It was like a trio or a four-piece. I forget."
01:31:48;01:31:53;"Great live band. I'm really curious now to look up YouTubes of that later period Modest Mouse."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"It sounds like there were eight people in it."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Yeah, I'd love to hear some of that."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"I think the Modest Mouse stuff was mid-decade."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"Okay. So yeah, this was his first solo album."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"Maybe a year or two before he moved to Portland."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Okay, the number five song this week in 2003."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"Justin Timberlake, ""Cry Me a River."""
01:32:11;01:32:14;"Big hit."
01:32:14;01:32:21;"Produced by Timbaland and Scott Storch."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"This was off his first solo record, right?"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"Yeah, Justified. Huge album."
01:32:26;01:32:37;"Wasn't a lot of Justified written for Michael Jackson, who passed on it?"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Yeah, that sounds kind of familiar."
01:32:39;01:32:45;"I think the first single was an MJ/Pharrell joint that was passed on."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Right, maybe some of the Neptune stuff."
01:32:47;01:32:51;"Well, this song is famously about Justin Timberlake,"
01:32:51;01:32:55;"or he certainly implied that Britney Spears had cheated on him."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Damn, who knows if that's true."
01:33:05;01:33:09;"It is possible that Timbaland was cooking up a song for Michael Jackson"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"about Britney Spears cheating on him,"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"and maybe Michael Jackson said, ""I don't connect to this."
01:33:14;01:33:17;"This says nothing to me about my life."""
01:33:17;01:33:20;"Maybe Justin Timberlake might see himself in it,"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"and Timberland said, ""That's a good idea."""
01:33:22;01:33:29;"Wait, pause it."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"I'm just wailing on these cheddar jalapeno megabytes over here."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Yeah, sorry, Justin Timberlake."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"We're not probably going to give our all and listen to the music"
01:33:37;01:33:41;"because all of us are just--we're all in frigging heaven right now"
01:33:41;01:33:45;"just crushing these cheddar jalapeno megabyte goldfish."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Megabyte, huge state."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"You know, the megabytes showing up right after we finished taping last episode"
01:33:51;01:33:54;"and then having them sit around was actually a PSYOP."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"It was actually a CIA PSYOP."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Operation Big and Crispy."
01:33:58;01:34:03;"Just to get us so hyped that by the time we ate them,"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"this was the greatest snack ever."
01:34:05;01:34:08;"Yeah, I mean, it was a study in human restraint,"
01:34:08;01:34:11;"which we all pass with flying colors."
01:34:11;01:34:15;"If you went to a party and these were in the bowl, Super Bowl party,"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"and no one had mentioned anything,"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"would it have occurred to you these were bigger?"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"You would have noted it."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"They're also flatter."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"The original goldfish are slightly more bulbous."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"This is more of just like a thinner cracker."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"I mean, it's obviously a different shape, but it's a good--"
01:34:34;01:34:37;"I mean, I guess this is this year's Super Bowl challenge."
01:34:37;01:34:40;"Go buy some cheddar jalapeno megabytes, put them in a bowl,"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"and see if anybody says anything."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"Because on the one hand, if you went up to somebody"
01:34:45;01:34:49;"and you showed them a megabyte and an old goldfish"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"and you said, ""Which of these is the more familiar goldfish?"""
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Of course, they would say, ""It's this one."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"This other one's kind of big and flat."""
01:34:56;01:34:58;"But it is a good question."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"You have to find out which ones of your friends are true snack heads"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"or who are interested in corporate food history."
01:35:03;01:35:06;"If you poured a bowl of these and you just put them out"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"and you invite like 8 to 10 people,"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"some people would note-- might clock it,"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"but would anybody actually say to you,"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"""Hey, I couldn't help but notice the goldfish you put out"
01:35:16;01:35:20;"were big and crispy, flat, and had a bit of a kick."

01:35:21;01:35:25;"I would just be immediately like, ""What's the story with these goldfish?"""
01:35:25;01:35:27;"-Whoa! What's going on? -Yeah, Jake would."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"What the f*ck is going on with these goldfish?"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Can I talk to you?"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"-Hey, come here for a second. -Whoa!"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Wait, wait, turn off the game. Turn off the game."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"Everybody, come here."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"What's going on?"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"What the f*ck?"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"Guys, shut it down."
01:35:44;01:35:46;"Everybody clear the room."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"-I need to talk to the host. -What is going on?"
01:35:48;01:35:49;"-I need the room. -I just think--"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"I could just picture so many people just eating handfuls of them"
01:35:52;01:35:53;"and just not giving a sh*t,"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"and then you as the host go up to them and be like,"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"""You notice anything different about those goldfish?"""
01:35:57;01:35:59;"And they'd be like, ""No."""
01:35:59;01:36:01;"And be like, ""They're cheddar jalapeno megabytes."""

01:36:03;01:36:06;"Their new product made to appeal to adults."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Okay, that's cool. I'm trying to watch the game."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"They also come in sharp cheddar."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Pretty cool, huh?"""
01:36:12;01:36:14;"It's right in the middle of Eminem's performance."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"Yeah, I really--"
01:36:16;01:36:21;"There could almost be this feeling of a Mandela effect or something."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"You know, just like you went and you were eating--"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Like you were having a stroke."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"You're like, ""Something's just not--"

01:36:30;01:36:32;"Not being able to pinpoint it. You know what I mean?"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"That's also a cool Super Bowl challenge."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Just put them out, and if anybody does say anything,"
01:36:36;01:36:40;"you say, ""These are bog-standard goldfish."""
01:36:40;01:36:42;"-It might be fun to-- -What are you talking about?"

01:36:43;01:36:45;"I've been buying the same giant thing of them"

01:36:58;01:37:00;"Oh, yeah, this is a very gentle jester type joke."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"What if you did something a little extra"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"where you played with the proportions?"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Like if you normally have a 46-inch TV,"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"get a 42-inch TV, get a little bit bigger chair,"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"get a smaller coffee table."
01:37:11;01:37:14;"-You may find everything. -It's the megabyte challenge."
01:37:14;01:37:18;"Side note, I looked up the average size of real goldfish,"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"and they're on average one to two inches long."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"So what you're eating there is pretty proportionate"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"-to the size of-- -Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"-All right. -Regular goldfish"
01:37:27;01:37:30;"-are one to two inches long? -No, no, like the animal."

01:37:36;01:37:38;"Yeah, the gold-- Yeah."

01:37:46;01:37:48;"-I mean, sure, if they're up to two inches. -A little guy."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Sure, like, yeah, an adolescent goldfish."
01:37:50;01:37:54;"Speaking of baby goldfish, there are baby goldfish."
01:37:54;01:37:57;"-Oh, that are even smaller? -That are even smaller."

01:38:00;01:38:02;"-Pepperidge farms. -That are actually for babies?"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"I guess, but babies can't eat goldfish."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"-But they're, like, tiny? -No matter what the size."
01:38:06;01:38:09;"It's not baby food. It's just a tinier cragger."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"-And they're called baby goldfish? -Yes, they're called baby goldfish."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"-I don't know-- -How about this?"

01:52:38;01:52:41;"(laughing)"

01:52:43;01:52:46;"- When you got with me, you stopped having pride."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"- Yeah, what's the intent there?"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"- Okay, here's what I, my guess,"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"the intent is that, you know,"
01:52:52;01:52:55;"in LL famously, he's like this pretty boy,"
01:52:55;01:52:59;"like lover man character, perhaps in real life too,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"you know, in a lot of his early work"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"where I think a lot of the songs he's like kind of,"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"you know, essentially like hitting on people,"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"kicking game."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"So I think probably in his mind,"
01:53:09;01:53:12;"he's probably imagining that he was talking to"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"a woman who was like too proud"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"to like give him the time of day."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"So I think in his mind, he's probably, you know,"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"it's like that she was so proud, you know,"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"'cause like people can describe somebody"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"as being like proud, like haughty,"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"like proud in like a negative way."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"And that there's a big difference"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"between the word proud and pride."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Like for instance, you know, back in the day,"
01:53:32;01:53:33;"people would describe you like,"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"""Look at them walking around all proud,"""
01:53:35;01:53:37;"almost meaning like they're full of themselves."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"Whereas if you said,"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"""Look at them walking around with a sense of pride,"""
01:53:40;01:53:42;"it just doesn't hit the same way."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Maybe because of like, you know,"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"the gay pride movement"
01:53:45;01:53:48;"or the civil rights movements, black pride,"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"the word pride has come to mean"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"more just like basic human dignity."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"But you know, there is the older version of proud."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"""Oh, look, so proud."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"""Oh, aren't you just so proud of yourself?"""
01:53:58;01:54:01;"So I think maybe LL is coming at it from that angle."
01:54:01;01:54:05;"Like, ""Oh, you used to be this very proud, haughty person"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"""who wouldn't, you look down on me,"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"""you wouldn't give me the time of day."

01:54:11;01:54:15;"That to say, ""You used to have pride,"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"""you no longer have it, but now you have me,"""

01:54:20;01:54:23;"- Especially the way Jennifer Lopez is teeing it up."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"""All my pride is all I have"" seems very much like,"
01:54:26;01:54:31;"""I've worked hard to gain this level of self-confidence."""
01:54:31;01:54:32;"And then LL is like--"

01:55:08;01:55:11;"I get why she and LL Cool J were using their model,"
01:55:11;01:55:14;"'cause they'd already been doing this for a couple years."
01:55:14;01:55:18;"Like, to me, this is a not quite as good version of ""I'm Real."""
