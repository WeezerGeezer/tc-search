00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:14;"After all our fun in Austin, it's time to get back to the things that make us who we are."
00:14;00:22;"Caesar salads, K-pop, and the Allman Brothers."
00:22;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:29;"Let's get it."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"You were a belt from a knee, all my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"In a lonely bed"
01:16;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:20;"What up?"
01:20;01:21;"What up, fellas?"
01:21;01:25;"Well, apparently we're on a tight time frame tonight."
01:25;01:30;"Just before we started recording, you informed us that we might have to land the plane without you"
01:30;01:33;"because you have an early flight."
01:33;01:36;"I'm getting on a real plane tomorrow to New Orleans."
01:36;01:41;"It's not crazy early, but I have to fulfill my familial obligations in the morning"
01:41;01:46;"and it's going to be hectic to do all that, come back to the house, get to the airport."
01:46;01:48;"I'm going to Jazz Fest."
01:48;01:50;"Nice. What's that?"
01:50;01:54;"It's a festival in New Orleans."
01:54;01:55;"Nice!"
01:55;01:59;"Centered around jazz music, such as Vampire Weekend."
01:59;02:02;"Okay, well yeah, you got the sax solo on Classical."
02:02;02:04;"That's what clinched it for us."
02:04;02:11;"They heard that classical sax solo and said, ""You boys are coming down to NOLA."""
02:11;02:17;"I think for a long time they've extended it beyond, it's just a celebration of music in general,"
02:17;02:25;"but it is a cool festival because they still maintain some real local flavor."
02:25;02:33;"I know there's certain tents and stuff that's all Dixieland and old school, early Southern jazz."
02:33;02:37;"Then you'll have rock bands and who knows what."
02:37;02:40;"You spend much time down in New Orleans, Jake?"
02:40;02:41;"Never been."
02:41;02:42;"Never?"
02:42;02:44;"Never been, dude."
02:44;02:48;"The American South is a total blind spot for me."
02:48;02:53;"Wait, but what about when we did Dirty Projectors tours together back in the early days?"
02:53;02:55;"Only time I've ever been to the American South."
02:55;02:57;"I've been to Florida, which is its own kingdom."
02:57;02:58;"Doesn't count."
02:58;03:04;"But the time that we played a show in Shreveport, Louisiana, I remember."
03:04;03:07;"I remember we drove across Mississippi and Alabama."
03:07;03:08;"Oh yeah, right."
03:08;03:11;"That's the only time I've ever been to that part of the world."
03:11;03:12;"Crazy."
03:12;03:19;"I've been to Texas a lot and Florida, but not the Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi."
03:19;03:24;"That's a cool Jake fun fact. Been to Shreveport, but not New Orleans."
03:24;03:26;"That's a deep cut."
03:26;03:27;"Yeah."
03:27;03:30;"Wait, you've never been to Atlanta?"
03:30;03:33;"I think on that same trip we went to Atlanta."
03:33;03:38;"Okay, so you haven't been into the real American South in decades."
03:38;03:40;"Going on 20 years."
03:40;03:41;"Wow."
03:41;03:44;"And it was just, you know, it was tour styles, like a real dip in and out."
03:44;03:47;"I don't have any sense of the American South."
03:47;03:48;"I would love to go."
03:48;03:49;"Nashville?"
03:49;03:53;"No, never been to Tennessee, never been to Memphis or Nashville."
03:53;04:01;"Never been to Kentucky, Tennessee, you know, those states either."
04:01;04:03;"I don't know if Kentucky considers itself Southern."
04:03;04:08;"That's a point of contention with the Kentuckians."
04:08;04:10;"Okay, but yeah, that's interesting."
04:10;04:13;"It's a real blank spot on my resume."
04:13;04:16;"You never been to the Redneck Riviera?"
04:16;04:17;"Where's that?"
04:17;04:19;"And forgive me if that term is derogatory."
04:19;04:30;"I just was told that's what you called the area where when we did this festival called Hangout Festival in the coastal Alabama."
04:30;04:37;"I remember catching a flight when we left out of Pensacola, Florida, which is like near the Florida Alabama border."
04:37;04:39;"Floribama."
04:39;04:47;"Yeah, people and people called that area the Redneck Riviera because you're on the water and it's deep South."
04:47;04:49;"Sounds dope."
04:49;04:51;"Yeah, you should take the family down there."
04:51;04:53;"Wait, have you guys been to New Orleans?"
04:53;04:55;"No."
04:55;04:58;"My brother had his bachelor party in New Orleans."
04:58;04:59;"Mardi Gras?"
04:59;05:00;"Oh yeah."
05:00;05:01;"It's not Mardi Gras."
05:01;05:08;"I went once for Mardi Gras for a story I was writing and it was really gross."
05:08;05:18;"And then I went for my brother's bachelor party, which was also a little gross, but not as gross as Mardi Gras."
05:18;05:20;"Beautiful city. Beautiful."
05:20;05:21;"I mean, it's definitely."
05:21;05:23;"People really love it."
05:23;05:25;"Like my brother really loves it."
05:25;05:27;"People love it and for good reason."
05:27;05:34;"As much as it and I'm not going to claim, you know, I've been there many times on tour."
05:34;05:38;"I don't know, maybe I've been to New Orleans five times or something."
05:38;05:42;"The French Quarter is like insanely touristy."
05:42;05:49;"So it can be like a little bit of a bummer when people are just like hammered holding the, what are they called?"
05:49;05:55;"Hurricanes and grenades, like giant novelty beverage, alcoholic beverages."
05:55;06:00;"It can be a little bit nasty, but it is a very striking place."
06:00;06:01;"It really has character."
06:01;06:03;"You know, that's why people descend on it."
06:03;06:10;"It has, you know, that's like a top five American city in terms of like having true character."
06:10;06:11;"Hey Ezra. Yeah."
06:11;06:14;"You ever eaten a gator while you were out there?"
06:14;06:16;"I don't think so."
06:16;06:21;"I know that there's restaurants where they give you some gators and I don't think so."
06:21;06:24;"I did get food poisoning from a po' boy once."
06:24;06:26;"Yeah, that was that was unpleasant."
06:26;06:30;"Anyway, that's what I'll be doing tomorrow is heading down to Jazz Fest."
06:30;06:35;"By the time you're listening to this, I'll probably be home from Jazz Fest."
06:35;06:47;"You'll never know, you'll never know what heaven means, what heaven means until you've been down to New Orleans, New Orleans."
06:47;06:58;"You ain't been living till you're kinda like a, a with a black eyed baby by the old bayou."
06:58;07:10;"You've never seen, you've never seen, Cupid dark wings, you've never seen those Cupid dark wings like they got 'em in New Orleans, New Orleans."
07:10;07:16;"Ooh, they love you like no one can."
07:16;07:21;"It makes you awful glad that you were born a man."
07:21;07:27;"If you ain't been there, been there, man you ain't been nowhere, nowhere."
07:27;07:32;"The living's lazy and the loving's fine, it's so fine."
07:32;07:38;"If you feel low down, low down, so help me Hannah, Hannah."
07:38;07:43;"You should lose a blues and lose it, lose it, lose it, Hannah."
07:43;07:48;"You guys are doing a couple festivals. I saw you're playing that one in Utah with GBV."
07:48;07:50;"Oh, are GBV there?"
07:50;07:54;"I'm alarmed you don't know that."
07:54;08:01;"Look, I gotta admit, I'm a little bit too old to take a hard look at the festival lineups."
08:01;08:05;"You know what? Respect, and I doubt Bob Pollard knows that you're there either, so."
08:05;08:11;"Oh, definitely not. He might not know the band, he definitely doesn't know that we're at this festival."
08:11;08:16;"He's heard of you, but has never actually probably heard you since the first record."
08:16;08:26;"And, um, is not aware that you're there in Utah sharing the same large venue stage complex."
08:26;08:29;"That's a crazy lineup though on that show."
08:29;08:36;"Wait, for real Ezra, you don't check out a lineup to see who you'd be in company with?"
08:36;08:39;"Well, here, I'll let you in a little bit behind the curtain."
08:39;08:43;"You know, festivals get booked well in advance, of course."
08:43;08:49;"Except for our surprise pop-up at Coachella, that literally was one week before."
08:49;08:59;"But, you know, generally speaking, you agree to a festival or they inquire about you and whatever well in advance, sometimes even a year before."
08:59;09:05;"So, when at first, the full lineup might not even exist."
09:05;09:11;"And sometimes if I get some information about it from our management or people we work with,"
09:11;09:17;"maybe they'll say, ""Oh, here's a couple other people that are playing or might be playing."""
09:17;09:19;"Yeah, the headliners."
09:19;09:23;"Yeah, like maybe if it's a headline offer, they'll say, ""And the other night is whoever."""
09:23;09:25;"So, sometimes there's a little bit of information."
09:25;09:29;"And then once in a blue moon, they might be like, ""You'd be playing in between these two artists."""
09:29;09:36;"But not always. And then anyway, let's say that's like seven to nine months before."
09:36;09:45;"Then by the time the show comes around, maybe I saw the poster, but I, you know, I've got enough stuff to think about."
09:45;09:51;"And so I often find that by the time we get to the festival, other band members are a bit more informed."
09:51;09:55;"And sometimes somebody else will be like, ""Oh, I want to go see whoever."""
09:55;09:57;"And I'll be like, ""Oh, they're here? Cool."""
09:57;10:06;"I think also the truth is that it's not out of any, you know, misanthropy. Is that how you say it?"
10:06;10:08;"Not out of being a misanthrope."
10:08;10:13;"The truth is I don't even necessarily want to know who's there because I probably can't see them."
10:13;10:18;"Because, you know, before our show, I get on site, I want to warm up, get in the zone."
10:18;10:23;"Back when I was younger, I used to sometimes try to like watch some other people and rush over to get ready."
10:23;10:27;"And I just felt like a little bit frazzled when I do that."
10:27;10:32;"It looks like a sick lineup. I low-key thought about going out to Utah."
10:32;10:35;"Oh, really? Who else is on the bill?"
10:35;10:37;"I don't have it in front of me. Does anyone have it in front of them?"
10:37;10:41;"I got it in front of me. You got Friend of the Show Joanna Newsom on there."
10:41;10:49;"You got Wu-Tang Clan, one of the influences of your new record."
10:49;10:57;"Oh, and I should point out, I did watch Wu-Tang at Roskilde Festival 2019."
10:57;11:03;"And that was tight. I remember they did a - I don't know if this is the right way to quite describe it,"
11:03;11:06;"but they did a cover of Come Together."
11:06;11:07;"Wow."
11:07;11:14;"They kind of like played like this like cool, like, sounded like, you know, 60s, early 70s soul version of Come Together."
11:14;11:15;"And they like put their hands in there."
11:15;11:20;"Come together. And they got all like the Danish people with their arms in there."
11:20;11:23;"So, yeah, I did watch Wu-Tang. Maybe I'll watch them again."
11:23;11:25;"OK, Joanna Newsom, Wu-Tang."
11:25;11:28;"All right. You got Jake's favorite, The Postal Service."
11:28;11:31;"You've got Dinosaur Jr."
11:31;11:35;"Also my favorite, LCD Sound System, another favorite."
11:35;11:39;"Yeah, you got Dino, you got GBV, you got Always."
11:39;11:40;"Oh, Always?"
11:40;11:41;"Yeah."
11:41;11:43;"Somebody played me Always recently."
11:43;11:44;"Good band."
11:44;11:45;"That band is very good."
11:45;11:46;"Yes."
11:46;11:48;"I heard a couple of songs that were excellent."
11:48;11:56;"I can't explain my anguish, but I didn't really feel it."
11:56;12:05;"Blue dress can turn your head, but how long till we're reeling in paradise?"
12:05;12:12;"Gonna find myself paralyzed, knowing all too well."
12:12;12:20;"The way I think I did it really mean it."
12:20;12:29;"Circus bands we call collectors, see if I'm a keeper at their doors."
12:29;12:36;"Gonna find myself paralyzed, knowing all too well."
12:36;12:42;"The way I think I did it really mean it."
12:42;12:45;"It doesn't say on the poster necessarily which day, right?"
12:45;12:46;"Is this a multi-day festival?"
12:46;12:51;"No, this is just like I'm looking at like a big, huge lineup."
12:51;12:54;"And a lot of stuff I've never heard of, but that doesn't mean anything,"
12:54;12:56;"because I don't know anything."
12:56;12:58;"Yeah, some of these seem made up."
12:58;13:01;"There's a band called Pond."
13:01;13:03;"I've heard of Pond."
13:03;13:04;"OK."
13:04;13:07;"Boyfriend Sushi Town?"
13:07;13:09;"That's a pretty good name."
13:09;13:11;"That's pretty strong."
13:11;13:15;"That name warrants a check out."
13:15;13:16;"Yeah."
13:16;13:19;"At Coachella, I was at Coachella very, very briefly."
13:19;13:24;"I had just gotten back from like our crazy long release week,"
13:24;13:28;"a little bit tired, and the idea of just like--"
13:28;13:34;"the idea of being home in my own bed after Coachella was just too enticing"
13:34;13:36;"to want to like stay."
13:36;13:43;"And also, I just wasn't in the mood to like party or have like a real crazy Coachella night."
13:43;13:45;"Coachella weekend? Yeah."
13:45;13:47;"Yeah, I wasn't ready to have a crazy Coachella weekend."
13:47;13:51;"I left it all on the-- I already had my crazy Austin weekend."
13:51;13:54;"But there was one artist I wanted to see at Coachella,"
13:54;13:56;"and luckily they were playing right after us,"
13:56;14:01;"so I caught a tight 15 side stage, and then I got the hell out of the desert."
14:01;14:07;"And that was Sublime with Bradley Noll's ""Sun"" singing."
14:07;14:09;"How was?"
14:09;14:13;"Well, one thing I always have to remind myself is that watching side stage,"
14:13;14:17;"as much as it seems kind of exciting, is like the worst place to watch."
14:17;14:18;"You can't hear anything."
14:18;14:20;"Terrible sound. Yeah."
14:20;14:23;"From what I could hear, he has a really good voice."
14:23;14:28;"His dad-- I thought it was really touching to see him shirtless,"
14:28;14:33;"playing with the guys, you know, singing his dad's song."
14:33;14:34;"I thought the vibe was great."
14:34;14:36;"I like their visuals."
14:36;14:39;"The other two dudes were like legends."
14:39;14:41;"I forget-- what's the bassist's name?"
14:41;14:45;"He had like this crazy hat on, cigarette hanging out of his mouth the whole time."
14:45;14:48;"Wow, Sig in 2024 on stage."
14:48;14:49;"Yep."
14:49;14:50;"Pushing the envelope. I like it."
14:50;14:52;"It was a good vibe."
14:52;14:54;"Is Bradley's ""Sun"" tatted up?"
14:54;14:57;"Not crazy. He had some tats."
14:57;15:00;"But he had a big smile on his face."
15:00;15:04;"So is this a new thing? Is this like a 2024 new rollout?"
15:04;15:05;"Yeah."
15:05;15:11;"So as you might know, for the last however many years, 5, 10 years,"
15:11;15:15;"there's been an act touring called Sublime with Rome."
15:15;15:21;"And that's the two surviving members of Sublime with a guy named Rome on vocals."
15:21;15:25;"They were touring a lot, and they built up a big following because, you know,"
15:25;15:30;"Sublime obviously never had a chance to really go hard touring the country."
15:30;15:33;"There's like all sorts of places where like Sublime--"
15:33;15:39;"like I don't even know if the original Sublime ever played a show in like Boston, for instance."
15:39;15:43;"They might have, but how many times could they have? Once? Maybe zero."
15:43;15:48;"So the two original Sublime guys and Rome team up for this thing called Sublime with Rome."
15:48;15:53;"They're touring. It's getting big. You know, they're like selling out Red Rocks, big shows."
15:53;15:58;"I think they even started introducing some original material next to the Sublime classics."
15:58;16:01;"I'm gonna go get a beer."
16:01;16:03;"I don't know if the audience felt that way."
16:03;16:06;"Actually, can we hear a Sublime with Rome original?"
16:06;16:08;"Wait, so keep going though. So now--"
16:08;16:12;"Okay, so Sublime with Rome is kind of fulfilling the Sublime prophecy."
16:12;16:13;"Yeah."
16:13;16:20;"Bring in this mix of punk, reggae, and hip-hop to the people, playing big shows, all that stuff."
16:20;16:25;"And then I don't know the exact story. Somebody tried to explain this to me recently."
16:25;16:31;"I might be missing some of the details, but at some point Sublime with Rome kicked out one of the OGs."
16:31;16:34;"And then somehow the other OG--"
16:34;16:40;"Oh, and then maybe that guy went to Bradley's son and said, ""Let's start a new Sublime."""
16:40;16:47;"And then the other OG left. And then Rome recruited a couple other guys to fill out Sublime with Rome."
16:47;16:49;"This is turning into a best show call."
16:49;16:52;"Yeah, it's getting pretty-- it's pretty Beach Boys."
16:52;17:00;"So now, I don't know if there's gonna be lawsuits or whatever, but Sublime with Rome is still on the road touring."
17:00;17:06;"And Sublime featuring Bradley's-- Noel's son. What's his name? Jacob?"
17:06;17:11;"Jacob Noel tells Rolling Stone he is not a Sublime with Rome fan."
17:11;17:15;"""It hit me like a gut shot. It didn't feel right."""
17:15;17:23;"So we have competing Sublimes touring, but Sublime with Jacob got the call from Coachella."
17:23;17:29;"The curators there went with the family lineage."
17:29;17:33;"I mean, it is kind of-- I don't know anything about Rome."
17:33;17:36;"I could understand, too. It's probably not a good feeling."
17:36;17:39;"It's the gig of a lifetime for a certain type of person."
17:39;17:46;"You get to become the new Bradley Noel, one of the most influential bands of the '90s."
17:46;17:52;"And things are going great. And maybe in the back of your head, there's a ticking clock, or maybe not."
17:52;17:59;"You know what? It's very European-- medieval European history."
17:59;18:05;"Just like you're the king for a while. You feel pretty stable in your position."
18:05;18:10;"These formerly powerful lords have pledged their loyalty to you."
18:10;18:15;"And things are going great. There's just one problem."
18:15;18:21;"That old king, his son is alive. He's being raised by--"
18:21;18:24;"He's being raised by a nobleman in France."
18:24;18:29;"And one of these days, he's daily growing."
18:29;18:30;"Where was that from?"
18:30;18:33;"There's a song called ""The Trees They Do Grow High."""
18:33;18:36;"That was an old English folk song that the Pentangle covered."
18:36;18:37;"Oh."
18:37;18:39;"And it was about a young man growing."
18:39;18:45;"So, yes, you think that the former king's bloodline has been extinguished."
18:45;18:50;"Little do you know that out in the green fields of France,"
18:50;18:54;"a young man is daily growing. And he grows strong."
18:54;18:57;"And every day he looks more and more like his father."
18:57;19:01;"And men are pledging their loyalty to him and say, ""We shall serve you, sir."""
19:01;19:09;"And soon he will set sail across the sea back to merry old England."
19:09;19:14;"He's going to-- like-- this is like Master Rome."
19:14;19:20;"Thirty boats have landed at Dover."
19:20;19:22;"And whose boats are these?"
19:22;19:24;"He's calling himself the true king."
19:24;19:26;"His name is Jacob."
19:26;19:28;"Jacob of what house?"
19:28;19:30;"Knoll, sir."
19:30;19:32;"The Knoll house."
19:34;19:36;"Wow. Yeah, man."
19:36;19:40;"You know, this is-- the way Jacob talks about it, very similar."
19:40;19:41;"What does he say?"
19:41;19:45;"This was like a birthright, you know, that he had no choice."
19:45;19:48;"So, by the way, Coachella also was his debut."
19:48;19:50;"I didn't know that."
19:50;19:52;"Oh, really? That was the first show?"
19:52;19:54;"Yeah, with Jacob."
19:54;19:58;"So here he says, ""I look at it as a custodial role,"" Jacob continues."
19:58;20:01;"""I'm not sublime. My uncles Bud and Eric are sublime."
20:01;20:04;"My dad never got to step on that stage, man."
20:04;20:08;"My dad never got to sing those songs in front of an audience that big at Coachella,"
20:08;20:11;"of people who adore him and his sound and his message."
20:11;20:14;"If you were a father, what would you want?"
20:14;20:18;"And I know I would want to have-- I know what I would want to have happen in that situation."
20:18;20:21;"So I have to do what I have to do."""
20:21;20:23;"He pulled the sword from the stone, dude."
20:23;20:24;"Yeah, exactly."
20:24;20:27;"He pulled the mother[bleep] sword from the stone."
20:27;20:30;"Yes, it shows-- the sword shows him."
20:30;20:34;"And you could totally picture in the-- in like the movie,"
20:34;20:37;"the Game of Thrones or the historical drama,"
20:37;20:40;"he's about to set sail back to England,"
20:40;20:45;"and his like mom or his-- one of his, you know, advisors is like,"
20:45;20:47;"""You don't have to do this, man."
20:47;20:51;"You have vast land holdings here in France."
20:51;20:53;"You have a good life. You're not king."""
20:53;20:56;"You can pursue your own interests."
20:56;20:58;"""You are a nobleman."
20:58;21:00;"You have people tilling the fields for you."
21:00;21:02;"You don't have to go back and do this."""
21:02;21:05;"And he's like, ""No, I do have to."""
21:05;21:08;"I can't imagine what my father would think"
21:08;21:11;"if he saw me just like sitting pretty."
21:11;21:16;"And honestly, I could kind of see that too because we got to hope--"
21:16;21:18;"I mean, first of all, the story is always so sad"
21:18;21:22;"because I think he was a baby when his dad died."
21:22;21:24;"That's my rough understanding."
21:24;21:29;"And also, of all the tragic deaths of the '90s,"
21:29;21:32;"the Brad Nolan one is one of the saddest"
21:32;21:35;"because as his son says, he didn't get a taste"
21:35;21:40;"of how much people-- how big the band would become."
21:40;21:42;"What year did Bradley die?"
21:42;21:45;"He died the week that the third album came out."
21:45;21:49;"He died the week that the ""What I Got"" Santeria album came out."
21:49;21:53;"So, what was that, '95?"
21:53;21:54;"'96."
21:55;21:56;"Died May 26th."
21:56;21:59;"Oh, my God. He was 28."
21:59;22:01;"So-- and Jacob's 28."
22:01;22:02;"Oh, my God."
22:02;22:06;"I don't know if he died before Jacob was even born."
22:06;22:08;"Oh, my-- yeah, he might have been--"
22:08;22:10;"either he was a newborn or he wasn't born."
22:10;22:15;"Well, he died May 25th and Jacob was born..."
22:15;22:17;"June 25th."
22:17;22:18;"Oh, my God."
22:18;22:19;"Oh, but no, he was born--"
22:19;22:23;"No, no, sorry, but Jacob was born June 25th, '95."
22:23;22:25;"Okay, so he was less than a year old."
22:25;22:26;"He was one, yeah."
22:26;22:27;"Yeah."
22:27;22:28;"Terrible."
22:28;22:30;"He's less than a year old, his dad dies."
22:30;22:33;"And so, you know, he's right."
22:33;22:36;"He's thinking-- he's growing up probably with people, like,"
22:36;22:40;"all the time saying, like, ""Oh, my God, I love your dad's music,"" and stuff."
22:40;22:42;"And that probably gave him, like--"
22:42;22:45;"it's probably nice to be in such a sad situation,"
22:45;22:51;"but to feel like at least you have this music to kind of dig into"
22:51;22:53;"to feel connection to your dad."
22:53;22:57;"And you-- it must be a proud feeling that you'd have people your whole life,"
22:57;23:00;"you know, wearing sublime t-shirts and stuff,"
23:00;23:02;"and you probably feel good about it."
23:02;23:06;"But, of course, that's going to gnaw at you thinking about not only the pain of,"
23:06;23:09;"you know, losing your dad and not growing up with him,"
23:09;23:12;"but also this feeling of, like, ""Wow, my dad was a talented guy"
23:12;23:15;"and he didn't-- he didn't get to see this."""
23:15;23:17;"That's got to be such a crazy feeling."
23:17;23:22;"I like that he's 28 and not, like, 19 or something."
23:22;23:24;"He's lived some-- he's lived some life."
23:24;23:25;"He waited."
23:25;23:28;"And I remember seeing a video a few years ago."
23:28;23:30;"He had his own bands, too."
23:30;23:33;"So it's like he did his kind of, like, punk rock thing for a minute."
23:33;23:36;"It's not like his first time performing was at Coachella,"
23:36;23:38;"even though that's his first time performing with Sublime."
23:38;23:40;"Right."
23:40;23:43;"But also something cosmic, right, about the fact that he waited"
23:43;23:48;"to the same age his dad died for him to take over."
23:48;23:51;"Yeah, it is kind of like the caterpillar becoming the butterfly"
23:51;23:54;"or something, like they're the same age."
23:54;23:57;"Also, I just want to say for the prestige drama,"
23:57;24:01;"that will be the TC production, you know, the HBO version."
24:01;24:03;"Sublime is obviously a good name."
24:03;24:06;"I mean, it's a strong name, but also without Rome."
24:06;24:08;"It's a good name."
24:08;24:09;"Title for a show?"
24:09;24:11;"For the title for the show, without Rome."
24:11;24:12;"I don't know."
24:12;24:14;"That sounds like a Game of Thrones."
24:14;24:18;"It's too bad that Sublime and Nirvana never played a show together."
24:18;24:19;"Just those two words together."
24:19;24:21;"Let's keep it-- well, you know what?"
24:21;24:23;"I think that Kurt would have hated Sublime."
24:23;24:24;"Oh, absolutely."
24:24;24:26;"I'm sad to say."
24:26;24:28;"No doubt."
24:28;24:30;"No pun intended."
24:30;24:32;"He would have hated No Doubt, too."
24:32;24:39;"Kurt had no love for, like, SoCal kind of funk-infused pop rock."
24:39;24:41;"Yeah, but maybe they would have gotten to know each other"
24:41;24:42;"and Kurt would have been like, ""You know what, man?"
24:42;24:44;"Brad's actually a cool guy."""
24:44;24:46;"I hate his music, but cool guy."
24:46;24:51;"Early in the morning, rising to the street."
24:51;24:56;"Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet."
24:56;25:01;"Got to find a reason, reason things went wrong."
25:01;25:06;"Got to find a reason why my money's all gone."
25:06;25:11;"I got a dalmatian that I could stay in."
25:11;25:15;"I can play the guitar like a mother[bleep] lion."
25:15;25:25;"[playing guitar]"
25:25;25:28;"Well, life is so long, the one you got."
25:28;25:31;"'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot."
25:31;25:33;"Never start no static, I just get it off my chest."
25:33;25:36;"Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest."
25:36;25:38;"Take a small example, take a little bit from me."
25:38;25:41;"Take all of your money, give it all to charity."
25:41;25:43;"Love is what I got, it's within my reach."
25:43;25:45;"And the soft-flat style still straight from Long Beach."
25:45;25:48;"It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve."
25:48;25:51;"Try and test that, your mommy gets sore."
25:51;25:53;"Love's what I got, don't start a riot."
25:53;25:56;"You feel it when the dance gets hot."
25:56;25:59;"Love is what I got."
25:59;26:01;"I said remember that."
26:01;26:04;"Love is what I got."
26:04;26:06;"Remember that."
26:06;26:09;"Love is what I got."
26:09;26:11;"I said remember that."
26:11;26:16;"Love is what I got."
26:16;26:19;"Why I don't cry when my dog runs away?"
26:19;26:21;"I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay."
26:21;26:24;"I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot."
26:24;26:26;"It's the bottle and the ride to the rock."
26:26;26:29;"It's the beginning and the right end, it's all the same."
26:29;26:31;"Living with Louis Dog's the only way to stay sane."
26:31;26:36;"Let the loving, let the loving come back to me."
26:36;26:38;"What do we know about Rome?"
26:38;26:42;"Oh yeah, wait, can we hear one of the originals?"
26:42;26:44;"Yeah, do we have a Sublime with Rome original?"
26:44;26:51;"She's got a knack for hurting me."
26:51;26:53;"Is it the words she says?"
26:53;26:57;"The only thing that keeps me here"
26:57;26:59;"Are her eyes in the morning."
26:59;27:03;"Well I've packed my things a thousand times."
27:03;27:08;"Oh, and I faked believe all her lies"
27:08;27:11;"For the last time."
27:11;27:14;"The other day I drew myself a map"
27:14;27:16;"So I can figure out her head."
27:16;27:18;"It turns out something in common with him vocally."
27:18;27:23;"Is this, I mean, so is this, Jacob does sound just like Bradley though."
27:23;27:25;"I mean, it's eerie."
27:25;27:27;"Sublime with Rome?"
27:27;27:30;"Yeah, Sublime with Rome became a little bit of its own thing."
27:30;27:34;"Okay, but on Apple Music, is this Sublime with Rome?"
27:34;27:37;"I'll take you to leave it, 'cause I'm really leaving."
27:37;27:40;"I purchased my ticket to New York first thing in the morning."
27:40;27:44;"Kissing you good morning, whispering goodbye."
27:44;27:48;"I mean, I'll say it's like with my rough knowledge of like"
27:48;27:53;"this world of kind of like chilled out reggae,"
27:53;27:56;"which is like adjacent to, there's a kind of like"
27:56;28:02;"not non-authentic reggae world that's like adjacent to the jam world."
28:02;28:06;"And I only mean non-authentic in the sense of like not coming from Jamaica."
28:06;28:08;"And I don't know if you played me this,"
28:08;28:13;"there's so many of these bands that have their own cult following."
28:13;28:15;"And if you played me that and I didn't know who it was,"
28:15;28:20;"and you just said, this is a band from, you know, Orange County,"
28:20;28:21;"and they're huge."
28:21;28:22;"I'd say, yeah, okay."
28:22;28:24;"I've heard stuff like that."
28:24;28:26;"Oh yeah, totally."
28:26;28:28;"Rome has a good voice."
28:28;28:32;"Maybe even has some, something to say as a songwriter."
28:32;28:34;"So I don't want to villainize Rome."
28:34;28:38;"Although of course in the prestige drama, Rome is the,"
28:38;28:40;"is sitting upon the throne."
28:40;28:44;"Yeah, he's like Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator or something."
28:44;28:45;"Yeah."
28:45;28:46;"That's a tough beat for Rome."
28:46;28:47;"I kind of feel for Rome."
28:47;28:48;"Yeah, it's-"
28:48;28:49;"No, totally."
28:49;28:51;"In season two, in season two, he's the Europe."
28:51;28:52;"Right."
28:52;28:57;"Season two, he's thrown off and you fully understand his story."
28:57;29:01;"You understand that he was sort of always the underdog."
29:01;29:02;"Right."
29:02;29:04;"Just not when we first meet him."
29:04;29:07;"I know this is, got legs."
29:07;29:11;"Okay, well I think this year, if you love Sublime,"
29:11;29:15;"go see a Sublime show, but also go see a Sublime with Rome show."
29:15;29:19;"Maybe we can get these guys to tour together."
29:19;29:22;"Who's going to open? Who's going to headline?"
29:22;29:23;"That's a tough one."
29:23;29:24;"I guess you swap."
29:24;29:26;"You got to swap every night."
29:26;29:27;"Yeah, you swap every night."
29:27;29:29;"Wow."
29:29;29:30;"Fascinating story."
29:30;29:34;"I'm sure at some point there'll be a 10,000 word article"
29:34;29:37;"that we'll all pour over."
29:37;29:42;"Well, you know, speaking of like early deaths"
29:42;29:44;"and like kind of familial drama,"
29:44;29:51;"I was just reading the Wikipedia page for Dwayne Allmond,"
29:51;29:58;"who died October 29th, 1971 at the age of 24,"
29:58;30:01;"when the Allmond brothers had put out two records."
30:01;30:05;"And then Dickie Betts, who just died last week,"
30:05;30:09;"carried on the band with Dwayne's brother, Greg."
30:09;30:12;"And by the way, Barry Oakley,"
30:12;30:18;"I just want to say Barry Oakley died almost a year to the day after Dwayne died."
30:18;30:21;"I mean, that band is a curse."
30:21;30:24;"You have a real Allmond brothers connection."
30:24;30:25;"Sure."
30:25;30:28;"I don't know to the extent that you want to disclose that."
30:28;30:30;"Have we discussed that on the show?"
30:30;30:32;"I think we probably talked about it and had a Amantha on it."
30:32;30:35;"Nick was the founding member of the Allmond brothers."
30:35;30:38;"Amantha's never been on the show."
30:38;30:40;"No, but I feel there was a time,"
30:40;30:42;"there was a COVID era time where we might have,"
30:42;30:43;"oh, you know what it was?"
30:43;30:46;"I think I brought her in to sort of whisper in my ear for widespread panic"
30:46;30:48;"when we were talking about spread heads,"
30:48;30:50;"because she also has a deep connection to widespread."
30:50;30:51;"Oh, right."
30:51;30:55;"But your wife, her father, Phil Walden,"
30:55;30:58;"started Capricorn Records. Is that right?"
30:58;31:01;"Yeah. He was Otis Redding's manager."
31:01;31:03;"And then when Otis passed away,"
31:03;31:08;"he sort of had to figure out sort of what his sort of path would be."
31:08;31:11;"And he put together the Allmond brothers."
31:11;31:16;"He found Dwayne Allmond and had him and Greg sort of create a band."
31:16;31:19;"And sort of, he sort of shepherded the idea."
31:19;31:21;"Really? Wow. I didn't know that."
31:21;31:22;"Yeah."
31:22;31:24;"So they're a boy band."
31:24;31:26;"They are very much a boy band."
31:26;31:29;"Phil Walden, Amantha's father,"
31:29;31:33;"he's seen in many ways as the godfather of Southern rock."
31:33;31:35;"Yeah. He coined the phrase."
31:35;31:37;"Southern rock."
31:37;31:41;"He saw Dwayne Allmond, I believe,"
31:41;31:46;"he was visiting Muscle Shoals and saw him with Wilson Pickett."
31:46;31:50;"Or maybe he had heard Wilson Pickett and then went to go find him."
31:50;31:53;"But sort of very actively went to go find Dwayne Allmond,"
31:53;31:58;"having heard his cover of, I think it was probably ""Hey Jude."""
31:58;32:01;"Yeah. That's the one that I think really put Dwayne on."
32:01;32:05;"Dwayne was like the house guitar player at Muscle Shoals."
32:05;32:07;"Wilson Pickett did ""Hey Jude."""
32:07;32:12;"And that really caught a lot of people's attention in the record biz."
32:13;32:18;"Hey Jude, don't make it bad"
32:18;32:25;"Take a sad song and make it better"
32:25;32:30;"Remember to let it in your heart"
32:30;32:36;"Then you can start to make it better"
32:36;32:42;"Hey Jude, don't be afraid"
32:42;32:48;"You were made, made to go out and get her"
32:48;32:54;"The minute you let her under your skin"
32:54;33:00;"Then you begin to make it better"
33:00;33:04;"You know, probably for possibly another time,"
33:04;33:10;"but we'd been working sort of for a while on a prestige drama"
33:10;33:14;"about the creation of Southern Rock and specifically"
33:14;33:18;"Amantha's dad, my father-in-law, who, you know, as we said,"
33:18;33:21;"put together the Allmond Brothers, then his younger brother,"
33:21;33:28;"trying to sort of prove himself, went and found Leonard Skinner."
33:28;33:32;"So it's these two brothers and two avatars."
33:32;33:37;"So something about it was, I mean, Dickie Betts,"
33:37;33:41;"his work on the song ""Blue Sky,"" that's my favorite guitar solo"
33:41;33:42;"in recorded music."
33:42;33:44;"Okay, we got to listen to that."
33:44;33:46;"""Blue Sky"" is the apex of the art form."
33:46;33:49;"You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day"
33:49;33:52;"I'm pretty sure that I just sent you guys, Dean Wien was saying how"
33:52;33:56;"every solo he's ever, he learned to play guitar based on Dickie Betts'"
33:56;33:58;"""Blue Sky"" solo."
33:58;34:03;"And his ""Any Time That We Never Rip"" solo is based on some iteration of this."
34:03;34:07;"I can hear that. And Dean has that thick tone that Dickie had."
34:07;34:10;"But yeah, Dickie has such a sweet voice."
34:10;34:13;"And it just, there's something about him, the band was just getting going"
34:13;34:17;"and he had this incredible guitar synergy with Dwayne."
34:17;34:19;"Dwayne dies at 24."
34:19;34:21;"Wait, so who's singing this?"
34:21;34:22;"Dickie."
34:22;34:23;"This is Dickie singing."
34:23;34:25;"Dwayne's not on this. Dwayne's dead."
34:25;34:26;"Yeah, right."
34:26;34:30;"But Dickie sang this and ""Ramblin' Man,"" which are kind of the biggest"
34:30;34:32;"Allman Brothers hits."
34:32;34:33;"And he wrote ""Jessica."""
34:33;34:36;"Right, that's another big Allman's hit."
34:36;34:39;"And so to carry on the Allman Brothers name."
34:39;34:44;"He was always to me the more country, he had the more country inflection of the band."
34:44;34:46;"For sure. Definitely."
34:56;35:01;"Although, there are recordings of Dwayne and Dickie playing this song live together."
35:01;35:05;"But I don't think Dwayne's on this recording."
35:05;35:08;"Here we go."
35:08;35:14;"Ezra, do you know this? You must know this."
35:14;35:18;"I know the song. I've never gone deep focusing on the solo."
35:28;35:30;"It's just two chords underneath."
35:30;35:36;"Compared to Skinner, Allman Brothers is so much more light."
35:36;35:38;"It's more Grateful Dead."
35:38;35:40;"Yeah, I was going to say."
35:40;35:42;"The sweetness, the jamminess."
35:42;35:44;"And melodic, too."

37:22;37:24;"And it's so beautiful."
37:24;37:27;"And it just expresses the content of the song so well."

39:25;39:28;"Maybe this is just because of where I grew up."
39:28;39:29;"And I think of, like,"

39:31;39:34;"The Beacon Theater on the Upper West Side of Manhattan."
39:34;39:35;"Right."
39:35;39:38;"Because, you know, they played dozens of shows there."
39:38;39:40;"That was, like, a famous thing."
39:40;39:42;"The Allmans at the Beacon."

40:09;40:10;"They were a huge touring band."
40:10;40:15;"But I feel like Cornell, Northeastern, Syracuse, New York."

57:46;57:49;"not the Moody Amphitheater, the Moody Theater,"
57:49;57:51;"which is exactly half the size"

57:53;57:57;"So if you're down, you'll do a morning show"
57:57;58:00;"and a late afternoon show in the Moody Theater."
58:00;58:01;"That day?"
58:01;58:02;"That day."
58:02;58:04;"And I remember thinking--"
58:04;58:06;"I was maybe just twisted off the ranch water,"
58:06;58:08;"but I remember thinking like, hey,"
58:08;58:11;"that'll be memorable too, you know?"
58:11;58:12;"And I even kept thinking like,"
58:12;58:16;"we have you guys in town and so many friends in town."
58:16;58:18;"I was like, all right, that's going"
58:18;58:20;"to be really crazy and loose,"
58:20;58:23;"especially if it's like crazy storm outside."
58:23;58:24;"We'll have some fun with it."
58:24;58:26;"We'll be like bringing people on stage."
58:26;58:27;"We'll mix it up."
58:27;58:30;"Doing two shows, probably a little bit exhausting,"
58:30;58:31;"but like whatever."
58:31;58:34;"So I was mentally prepared for that."
58:34;58:37;"And then day of, they're like, you know what?"
58:37;58:38;"It's going to be fun."
58:38;58:42;"Actually, the day before, it was like, you know what?"
58:42;58:45;"Everybody's saying it's reasonable to stick with it."
58:45;58:46;"And I said, great, cool."
58:46;58:47;"We'll do it outside."
58:47;58:52;"But then the big talk was, but it's probably going to be cloudy."
58:52;58:54;"And then I remember thinking like, well, all right."
58:54;58:56;"We'll still have fun at the show."
58:56;58:58;"That's huge that it still gets to be outside,"
58:58;59:00;"but people just won't see the eclipse."
59:00;59:03;"And then I don't know exactly what your guys' experience was,"
59:03;59:06;"but you know, we're playing."
59:06;59:09;"We're doing that, the funky flower moon."
59:09;59:10;"It's getting dark."
59:10;59:11;"It's getting weird."
59:11;59:12;"Great version."
59:12;59:13;"Thank you."
59:13;59:14;"The vibe is getting crazy."
59:14;59:20;"And then we leave the stage and me and the guys are kind of standing in the parking lot."
59:20;59:22;"And we looked up into the sky."
59:22;59:25;"I see nothing but like a pure white sheet."
59:25;59:28;"And I'm thinking to myself like, well, it's pretty cool how dark it is."
59:28;59:33;"This is pretty weird and a unique experience no matter what."
59:33;59:35;"And I'm looking up with my glasses."
59:35;59:38;"And then my memory of this, I've been describing to people,"
59:38;59:42;"is the clouds parted for two seconds."
59:42;59:47;"And we perfectly saw the moon in front of the sun and then vanished again."
59:47;59:53;"And I could hear the crowd from across the parking lot just like erupt,"
59:53;59:56;"cheering and emotion and stuff."
59:56;59:58;"And I was thinking to myself, I was like, you know what?"
59:58;01:00:02;"I'm sure it's pretty interesting to watch the whole thing unfold."
01:00:02;01:00:10;"But the drama of that, that brief cloud parting moment was incredible."
01:00:10;01:00:12;"Actually, it couldn't have been better."
01:00:12;01:00:19;"As someone that's seen two eclipses, I have to say the second one was way vibier and crazier."
01:00:19;01:00:23;"Because the first one I saw in Casper, Wyoming, it was a cloudless day."
01:00:23;01:00:29;"And so when the full eclipse occurred, it was a very uncanny light, as I've said before on the show."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"That was my favorite part of the visual, TC."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"Because I wasn't there for those parts."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"And I'm like watching it."
01:00:36;01:00:40;"It's like you guys are hanging out live on the scene, chilling with Despot and Jake."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"You're like, people are like, so it's going to be like nighttime."
01:00:43;01:00:47;"And you're like, guys, at the one in Wyoming, it's more of an uncanny light."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"You're going to see an uncanny light."
01:00:49;01:00:56;"And then later in the show, you're like, I got to tell you, folks, this was more than an uncanny light."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"This was a terrifying darkness."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Is that what I said?"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"Yeah, you said, guys, the clouds actually changed the vibe."
01:01:03;01:01:08;"You said if Casper, Wyoming was a uncanny light, this was a terrifying darkness."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Oh, funny."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"Yeah, well, that's all I was going to repeat myself."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"Because, yeah, it was so dark."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"It was crazy."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"And like--"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"It was nighttime, full nighttime."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"And it got cold, too."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And the temperature went way down."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"And people were cheering."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"That was crazy."
01:01:29;01:01:37;"It was cool, too, because I feel like, from my perspective, the eclipse was kind of peeking in and out."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"For me, it wasn't just a single moment."
01:01:39;01:01:45;"But there were a lot of times where the cloud cover allowed you to be able to kind of look at it with the naked eye."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"And so, you know what I mean?"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"It was like--"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"Oh, wait, did the crescent shape ever leave your retinas, Seinfeld?"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"No, no, it's still--"

01:08:42;01:08:43;"It was a very heaviness."
01:08:43;01:08:47;"And I talked to, like, Max was there, you know, obviously,"
01:08:47;01:08:53;"doing some on-site reporting, you know, crowd work, light crowd work for the TC heads."
01:08:53;01:08:56;"And he was like, I feel very weird."
01:08:56;01:09:00;"Like he had sort of probably what would have been described if he were older"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"as like kind of a druggy experience, like feeling hot."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"Well, I think there's something called eclipse fever."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"You can mess with people."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"I got it."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Yeah, well, you actually got sick after."
01:09:11;01:09:12;"It could be positive or negative."
01:09:12;01:09:21;"You know, I met an indigenous person later that day who told me they were fasting."
01:09:21;01:09:26;"We had a very brief conversation, so I didn't fully understand if that's something like that"
01:09:26;01:09:32;"their whole community does or it's traditional or what, but they were fasting."
01:09:32;01:09:36;"But ultimately, their interpretation of the eclipse was positive because I was like--"
01:09:36;01:09:40;"because they were saying, like, you know, this is serious because the sun is the--"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"you know, represents the creator or the sun is the creator."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"And then I was like, well, what does it mean that the creator gets covered up?"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"And they're just like, it's a rebirth, man."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"I was like, that's cool."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Wow."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"Ezra, the bats came out, huh?"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"I don't know if I caught any, but did you guys see any bats?"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"No, but I heard reports."
01:09:59;01:10:07;"I absolutely saw them, and I have some very loose photo of it, but they--"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"which is-- I would say a handful of them came out."
01:10:10;01:10:14;"But, you know, there's the bridge that's, you know--"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Oh, yeah, that goes across the river."
01:10:15;01:10:19;"--not a mile away, but it's not near the venue."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"But there's a bridge that's sort of famously--"
01:10:21;01:10:27;"at Southwest, everyone's always talking about, like, millions of bats go underneath this bridge by the overpass."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"And so everyone's like, well, would they come out?"
01:10:28;01:10:37;"And they certainly flew out enough to make it a kind of a moment at a Vampire Weekend show"
01:10:37;01:10:43;"that on the eclipse in the middle of the day, a handful of bats swooped over the amphitheater."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"It was cool."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Crazy."
01:10:46;01:10:50;"We got bats. We got terrifying darkness."
01:10:50;01:10:53;"We got parting of the clouds."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"We got a vampire doing a Flying Burrito Brothers cover."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"We got it all, folks."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"We got a little taste of Sin City."
01:11:01;01:11:07;"Yeah, I mean, it really was-- shout out to Lou Reed-- a perfect day."
01:11:07;01:11:14;"And also, it was-- and it's cool when stuff just, like, naturally flows, like, you know, whatever."
01:11:14;01:11:17;"Seven years ago, Jake, you told me about seeing the eclipse."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"I look it up. It's my 40th birthday."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"I have it in the back of my head."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Working on an album."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"TC Prophecy."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"TC Prophecy fulfilled."
01:11:24;01:11:32;"And also, just everything about it, too, is that then to have the show during the day--"
01:11:32;01:11:37;"also, it was such a good feeling to, like, kind of be done in the middle of the afternoon,"
01:11:37;01:11:43;"go back to the hotel, chill for a minute, meet all the crew for a drink,"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"and then have, like, a birthday party at night."
01:11:46;01:11:49;"Ezra, 40th birthday party, blowout, very fun."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"What a crew assembled."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"A lot of fun."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Some rousing toast."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Good barbecue."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"It was great."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"Yeah, truly a perfect day."
01:11:57;01:12:02;"And then early morning flight to New York."
01:12:02;01:12:06;"Oh, that's right. You were out early the next day."
01:12:06;01:12:12;"That was a crazy week with doing some-- what did we do?"
01:12:12;01:12:21;"Record signing at a Midtown Rough Trade daily show, 30-minute Cape Cod with Goose."
01:12:21;01:12:25;"Hit a Rangers game."
01:12:25;01:12:32;"And then we capped off the whole long release week with our surprise Coachella performance."
01:12:32;01:12:37;"Brought in Paris Hilton and Abraham Lincoln and called it a day."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"I was thinking--"
01:12:38;01:12:39;"It's a hell of a week."
01:12:39;01:12:43;"Yeah, I'll have to get a little more distance from it,"
01:12:43;01:12:48;"but when I got home after Coachella, I remember thinking,"
01:12:48;01:12:53;"""This is definitely one of the best weeks of my life."""
01:12:53;01:12:57;"But, you know, I've had all sorts of different kinds of great weeks in my life,"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"you know, low-key ones, too."
01:12:59;01:13:06;"But I will say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether or not it is the top five best week or not,"
01:13:06;01:13:13;"it was, I think, in terms of sheer variety of activities, the most random week of my life."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Yeah, that's a hell of a list."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Yeah, just back to back to back."
01:13:16;01:13:21;"30-minute Cape Cod with Goose."
01:13:21;01:13:25;"To Paris Hilton, I guess just hanging out on stage."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"I just saw--"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"No, she did--"
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Did she sing?"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"No, she did the cornhole section."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Oh, right, that Josh did."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"Of Cocaine Cowboys, yeah."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Right, right, right, right."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"But I did like her style."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"She didn't want to lose the game."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Yeah, so she said, ""Is it okay if I cheat?"""
01:13:42;01:13:43;"She dropped it in."
01:13:43;01:13:46;"It's like, I mean, talk about showmanship."
01:13:46;01:13:49;"It's like pure Paris."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"Also, we didn't have time--"
01:13:50;01:13:54;"It was like coming down to the wire whether or not she was actually going to come out on stage."
01:13:54;01:14:02;"I looked over just as we kicked into Cocaine Cowboys, and I got a thumbs up from the stage manager."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"Just like, ""All right."""
01:14:03;01:14:04;"So I was like, ""Okay, great."""
01:14:04;01:14:05;"She came out."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"There was no rehearsal."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"And she just had a great instinct."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"I'm going to just throw it in at the end."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"Good vibes."
01:14:12;01:14:18;"I don't mind spending some time"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"Just hanging here with you"
01:14:21;01:14:28;"'Cause I don't find too many guys"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"That treat me like you do"
01:14:31;01:14:36;"Those other guys, they want to take me for a ride"
01:14:36;01:14:40;"But when I walk, it's like a suicide"
01:14:40;01:14:45;"Some people never get beyond their stupid pride"
01:14:45;01:14:49;"But you can see the real me inside"
01:14:49;01:14:54;"And I'm satisfied, oh no, oh"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"Even though the guys are crazy"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Even though the stars are blind"
01:14:59;01:15:04;"If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"I can make you nice and naughty"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"Make a devil and angel too"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Got a heart and soul and body"
01:15:10;01:15:15;"Let's see what this love can do"
01:15:15;01:15:19;"Maybe I'm perfect for you"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"I was at a 7-Eleven buying some Tic Tacs,"
01:15:22;01:15:29;"and I came across a new type of Doritos, a special edition Doritos."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"I'm pulling it up here on the text thread."
01:15:32;01:15:37;"It was Doritos Baja, sorry, Baja Fiery Mango."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"And I sent a picture to the thread."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"That's a mouthful."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"Baja Fiery Mango, and it's a picture."
01:15:43;01:15:47;"There's a shark on there, and it's sort of biting through the packaging."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"It's very trippy."
01:15:48;01:15:52;"I sent it to the thread, and then we started talking about Baja."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Like, what is Baja cuisine?"
01:15:54;01:15:58;"'Cause we were just like, what is that Baja blast?"
01:15:58;01:16:02;"Well, first and foremost, though, to understand, I mean, this is like classic."
01:16:02;01:16:08;"Just so many layers deep of references and signifiers that you're just like,"
01:16:08;01:16:09;"what does this mean?"
01:16:09;01:16:13;"Baja Fiery Mango Doritos?"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"And I guess this all comes--it's the 20th anniversary."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"It's the Bajaversary."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"That's the actual phrase being thrown around."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"Of Mountain Dew Baja Blast."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"Diamond mill, baby, New York City"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"Now is there ever a girl so pretty"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Do you think we'll be in love forever?"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"Do you think we'll be in love?"
01:16:35;01:16:38;"Diamond mill, baby, New York City"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"Can we get an L up down and pretty?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Do you think we'll be in love forever?"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"Do you think we'll be in love?"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"'Cause we're gonna take a ride"
01:16:51;01:16:54;"I'm not gonna listen to what the past says"
01:16:54;01:16:57;"I've been waiting up all night"
01:16:57;01:17:00;"Taking all the drag, turning me to ashes"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Ready for another love"
01:17:02;01:17:06;"Says it's gonna teach me just what fast is safe"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"It's gonna be all right"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"Diamond mill, baby, New York City"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"Now is there ever a girl so pretty"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Do you think we'll be in love forever?"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"Do you think we'll be in love?"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"Diamond mill, baby, New York City"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"Can we get an L up down and pretty?"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"Do you think we'll be in love forever?"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Do you think we'll be in love?"
01:17:29;01:17:34;"So first of all, this is a flavor that began with Mountain Dew"
01:17:34;01:17:39;"and has now migrated to its cousin brand, Doritos"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"And just off the top of your guys' heads, do you even"
01:17:42;01:17:46;"do you know what flavor Baja Blast is in the Mountain Dew context?"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"Blue? Like what color is it?"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"No, what's the flavor supposed to be?"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"I think it is blue"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Does Mountain Dew have flavor?"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"That's a good question"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"I thought Mountain Dew was the flavor"
01:17:59;01:18:05;"Well, is Mountain Dew considered a lemon-lime product?"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Technically, yes"
01:18:07;01:18:12;"But if you tasted it not knowing that, I don't think you would necessarily associate it with lemon-lime"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"No, that's true"
01:18:14;01:18:19;"It's its own distinct palette"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"Yeah, I mean, it's kind of green"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"It's a green flavor"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"It's a neon flavor"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"The rare old Mountain Dew"
01:18:28;01:18:36;"By the way, Baja Blast, I think we realized or rediscovered, was a Taco Bell exclusive"
01:18:36;01:18:41;"So it was a Mountain Dew flavor variant that was released only in Taco Bell"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"20 years ago"
01:18:43;01:18:51;"Also to be clear, whatever flavor Mountain Dew is, Baja Blast is a tropical lime-flavored soft drink"
01:18:51;01:18:54;"So the Baja is lime"
01:18:54;01:18:58;"But what does tropical mean in that context?"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Yeah, I mean, a lime is a tropical fruit"
01:19:00;01:19:04;"When someone says tropical, I would think pineapple"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"Do you know? Like what would your brain..."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Right, citrus, citrus, pineapple"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Maybe coconut?"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Mango"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Yours goes to mango"
01:19:12;01:19:18;"Oh, which is why the Doritos was a mango-Baja, fiery mango, right?"
01:19:18;01:19:19;"Yep"
01:19:19;01:19:22;"But it's also unclear with all these..."
01:19:22;01:19:28;"For the Bajaversary, Pepsi's also released two new flavors of Mountain Dew"
01:19:28;01:19:32;"Baja Laguna Lemonade, which is a mango-lemonade flavor"
01:19:32;01:19:36;"And Baja Point Break Punch, a tropical punch flavor"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Wait, point break?"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"Baja Point Break Punch"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Like Reagan masks and like..."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Yeah, I guess they are trying to get..."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"So I guess that a certain..."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Maybe Baja..."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"The original Baja Blast was lime-flavored"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"But maybe at this point Baja is just like a state of mind"
01:19:54;01:19:58;"And you can apply it to anything vaguely tropical"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Yeah"
01:20:01;01:20:05;"So we start all kind of investigating like what is Baja"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"Like the origins of Baja cuisine"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"And then, you know, it's like..."
01:20:09;01:20:12;"For anybody who doesn't know, we're talking about Baja, California"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"The peninsula"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Yes, thank you"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"The Pacific region"
01:20:18;01:20:19;"In Mexico"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"Right, and then so Baja cuisine is like seafood-oriented"
01:20:22;01:20:29;"But then an eagle-eyed Jake spots that Caesar salad was invented in Baja"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Well, yeah, there was something..."
01:20:31;01:20:34;"There was some screen grab or something that was on the thread"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"That... I was just playing catch up here"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"I was off the thread for a while"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"I look at my phone, I got like 19 text messages"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"It's all Crisis Crew"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"I'm like, I'm going through this Baja mango crunch Doritos"
01:20:47;01:20:50;"I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, same old crap"
01:20:50;01:20:55;"And then there was some screen grab of like Baja cuisine"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"And it said Caesar salad"
01:20:56;01:20:59;"And I was like, wait a second"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"What's going on here?"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Record scratch moment"
01:21:02;01:21:07;"The Caesar salad was invented in Mexico, in Baja, California?"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"Yes, specifically Tijuana"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Specifically Tijuana"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"It was invented... I'll just get into it"
01:21:12;01:21:17;"I mean, so on the thread, I just was kind of like doing a little live research on the thread"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"And it just kept getting deeper"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"And as anything, you know, anything that's really truly significant"
01:21:22;01:21:26;"Eventually does eventually go back to the JFK assassination"
01:21:26;01:21:30;"And Caesar salads most certainly do"
01:21:30;01:21:36;"But the Caesar salad was invented July 4th weekend, 1924"
01:21:36;01:21:42;"By Caesar Cardini, a restaurateur from the San Diego area"
01:21:42;01:21:47;"Who was an Italian immigrant, but then opened a restaurant in Tijuana"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"Because it was the height of prohibition"
01:21:49;01:21:54;"And so people from SoCal were going down to Tijuana to party"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"To get hammered in Tijuana"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"To get twisted off of ranch water"
01:21:59;01:22:04;"And so he had like a really popular restaurant down there"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"And there was some... I don't know, I didn't really understand the story"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"As it's on Wikipedia, but basically he ran out of ingredients"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"And just sort of started improvving"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"And started making these big salads"
01:22:15;01:22:21;"And doing this kind of dramatic performative thing of like tossing the salad table side"
01:22:21;01:22:25;"And it became like a real big hit pretty instantly"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"And it was, yeah, it was a romaine lettuce"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"I think he's..."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Wait, so..."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Yeah, go ahead"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"So Jake, wait, just..."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"So he's out of ingredients"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"So he goes, okay, I'm going to improvise"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"And I'm going to add a little entertainment to it"
01:22:36;01:22:39;"I'm going to overcompensate by tossing these vegetables"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"You know what, this is an Italian restaurant"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"I'm going to grate some parmesan on here"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"And I'm going to crack an egg"
01:22:45;01:22:48;"And, you know, do some crushed red..."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"Like, you know, some crushed black pepper on there"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Some lemon juice"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"Exactly"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"Interestingly though, if I remember the thread correctly"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Someone said that anchovies"
01:22:58;01:23:03;"Which I consider the sort of the staple of a Caesar salad"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Those are added actually in New York"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"Yeah, so..."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Is that right?"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"Yeah, exactly, I'm getting to that"
01:23:09;01:23:13;"So the salad's like a big hit in Tijuana and in SoCal"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"And it migrates up, back up north of the border"
01:23:16;01:23:21;"To all of Caesar Cardini's restaurants in San Diego and in Hollywood"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"And I get the sense that it's sort of like a fashionable salad"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"With the Hollywood set in the 20s"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"Sort of like..."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"What's an example of like..."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"I don't know, if you go to like..."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"What's like a cool rest..."
01:23:33;01:23:34;"Like horses or something?"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Like, what's like a..."
01:23:35;01:23:37;"I'm bad at restaurant stuff"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"So what's like a contemporary cool salad that you would get?"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"A contemporary cool salad?"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"Well, salads are so global now"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Not like a classic salad"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"But I mean, you could see how chopped salads..."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"Chopped salads have gotten more mainstream"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Yeah, like the La Scala chopped salad"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"Like a restaurant famous for their salad"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Yeah, even though that was like 80s"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"But that's still beloved and chopped"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"I got a weird analogy"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"We remember like four years ago"
01:24:04;01:24:07;"When like the Aperol Spritz was like the..."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"There we go"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"The trendy"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"It's like the Aperol Spritz of Caesar..."
01:24:12;01:24:15;"Exactly, it was like a trendy rest..."
01:24:15;01:24:19;"You know, salad at that time in SoCal"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"And then so it takes a while"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"It does get to New York"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"And you're right, Nick"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"That's when the anchovies get added"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"Kale salad"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"Kale salad feels like that happened..."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"More of a modern salad"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"That was a moment"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"There you go"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"Yeah"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Exactly"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Some kid in old age"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Hit upon my shoulder"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Rolled through life"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"To roll over and die"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"La la la la la"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"La la la la la"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Oh oh oh"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"Missing him in John"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Sad the days are gone"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Remembering things"
01:24:58;01:25:01;"Just to tell him so long"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"La la la la la"
01:25:05;01:25:08;"La la la la la"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Oh oh oh"
01:25:10;01:25:15;"Oh mama"
01:25:15;01:25:20;"I'm too glad my life's already over"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"Oh dear"
01:25:24;01:25:28;"I'll act your age and try another year"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"Picture 1920s Hollywood"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"People just crushing Caesar salads"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"Crushing martinis"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"Eventually Prohibition ends"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"Sometime in the 20s"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"But anyway"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"The Caesar salad's invented in '24"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"The first reference"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"To anchovies being added"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Is in 1946"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"So it took a while"
01:25:48;01:25:51;"It took a good 20 years for"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"The salad to migrate to the East Coast"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"And people were there to be like"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Let's add anchovies"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"And it's first written about"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"By this woman Dorothy Kilgallen"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Who was a very well-known"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"Newspaper columnist at the time"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"Who..."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"What does she write here?"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"She goes..."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"She wrote of the Caesar containing anchovies"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Differing from the Cardini version"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"The big food rage in Hollywood"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"The Caesar salad"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Will be introduced to New Yorkers"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"By Gilmore's Steakhouse"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"It's an intricate concoction"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"That takes ages to prepare"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"And contains zowie"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Lots of garlic"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Raw or slightly coddled eggs"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Croutons, romaine, anchovies"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"Parmesan cheese, olive oil, vinegar"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"And plenty of black pepper"
01:26:31;01:26:34;"So this woman, Dorothy Kilgallen"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"She writes about the Caesar salad"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"And the anchovies in 1946"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"Kennedy's assassinated in 1963"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"She is one of the kind of like"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Early prominent journalists"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"To question the Warren Commission"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"She's writing columns in 1964"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Being like"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"This doesn't add up folks"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"And then she goes to the Jack Ruby trial"
01:26:57;01:27:00;"Because he shot and killed Oswald"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"And he's on trial for murder"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"And she talks to him"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"During one of the courtroom breaks"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"So it's not like a formal sit down"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Like 60 minutes interview"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"But she manages to get some face time"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"With Jack Ruby"
01:27:12;01:27:15;"And writes about that in one of her columns"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Then she dies in 1965"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"An overdose of alcohol and barbiturates"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"People in the JFK researcher community"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"They're not buying it"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"Yeah, they think that she was killed"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"That her death was suspicious"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"But you know, it was just like"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Classic internet rabbit hole"
01:27:32;01:27:35;"Like, oh we're joking around about"
01:27:35;01:27:38;"Baja mango crunch Doritos"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"What's this? Caesar salad?"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Okay, that's interesting"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Oh wait, what's this?"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"Just two clicks away"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"We're already at the Kennedy assassination"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"Feels about right"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"It's also interesting that"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"I gotta understand this"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"This woman who's sort of beat"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"To write is like light fare"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"Of writing about Caesar salads"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Right?"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"She somehow gets an interview"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"With Jack Ruby"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Hmm"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"You know what I mean?"
01:28:04;01:28:05;"That's weird"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"Like this woman is just sitting there"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Doing like society page"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Little things and somehow"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Right, well I guess you gotta start somewhere"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"She gains access"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Yeah, I mean the Caesar salad article"
01:28:16;01:28:18;"The anchovies in the Caesar salad article"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"At the steakhouse"
01:28:20;01:28:23;"17 years before the Kennedy assassination"
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Okay"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"But yeah, no she was like a well known"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"You see where I'm getting at?"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"I don't know if she's"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"No, I understand"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"She's an op, but like, yeah"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"Or some kind of plant, but"
01:28:32;01:28:35;"I just wanna call out that the Cobb salad"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Not to go on a whole other thing"
01:28:36;01:28:39;"Was named after Robert Cobb"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"The founder of the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"And I just wanna say like"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"You don't really hear about a lot of salads"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Named after people anymore"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"But it seems like the Caesar salad"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"The Cobb salad"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Seems like there was an era"
01:28:51;01:28:54;"When you could come up with a salad"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"And then have it be your namesake"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"And those days are over"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"And also, like SoCal"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"And Northern Mexico based"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Like"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"You just don't think of like"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"Of this region of the world"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"SoCal and Northern Mexico"
01:29:09;01:29:12;"Being like the hub of salad creation"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"I mean I guess you do now"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"With like fancy LA restaurant culture"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"But you don't think of 100 years ago"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Being like, man"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"But there is something about this story"
01:29:21;01:29:24;"I can't recall exactly"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"But there's something about this story"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"That I know we've been down similar paths"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"Before on the show"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Where I think similar to like the story"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"About the invention of the potato chip"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"And the cheeseburger"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"It's always like one crazy night at a hotel"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"It's always like"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"The story is always like"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"And so this guy"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"He was the chef at a place"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And then it was a crazy night"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"They ran out of something"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"And next thing you know"
01:29:48;01:29:51;"This guy's slicing potatoes as thin as he can"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Or he said"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"Or then this guy said"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"F*ck it, put the cheese right on top of the burger"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"And it's always the same story"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Which I don't know if that's just"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"You know, what do they say?"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Necessities of the mother of invention?"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Or if"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"Or if this is just like"
01:30:07;01:30:08;"You know"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"It's a hero with a thousand faces"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"It's all myth"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"It's very innocent in a way"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Just like"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Oh my god"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"This guy was just like"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Improvising this salad"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"And it took off, folks"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"Yeah, and I feel like"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"And I feel like the same thing"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"With like alcoholic drinks"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"And it's like"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"And next thing you know"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"They're out of whiskey"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"And he says"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"I'll try vodka"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"You know, and like"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"That's how the martini was invented"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"I do love to think about Prohibition Era"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"Because usually when you think of Prohibition Era"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"It's, you know"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"It's the"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"New York and Chicago"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Exactly"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"It's Al Capone"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Right"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"It's gangsters with like"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Machine guns and trench coats"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Prohibition SoCal is very interesting"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"And actually, an early version"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"The Caesar salad was also"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"For a while called the Aviator salad"
01:30:56;01:30:59;"Because people would fly"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"From LA down to Tijuana"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"To go down there and drink"
01:31:03;01:31:04;"And eat Caesar salads"
01:31:04;01:31:05;"Aviator salads"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Not to be a hater, but"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"I can only really"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"And I love Caesar salads"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"And I guess that means"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"I'm a fan of"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Cesar Cardini"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"But I can't fully judge"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"His genius"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Without having a stronger sense"
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Of the pre-1924 salad scene"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"Right"
01:31:27;01:31:28;"You know what I mean?"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"And I guess we take it for granted that"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"That a salad dressing is going to be tangy"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"And might have some cheese on it"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"Like everything about the Caesar salad"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Is, feels like"
01:31:39;01:31:40;"Yeah, of course"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"These are the things that often go into a salad"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"But I guess what I'm curious"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"And maybe we'll never know"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Is if you're just a regular American"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"You've been eating salads your whole life"
01:31:50;01:31:53;"Then you find yourself down Mexico way"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"At this hotel in Tijuana"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"And you get your first Caesar salad"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Is it just like, you're like"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Oh, you know what?"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"That's actually an extra good salad"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Or is like you're mind blown?"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"You're like, whoa, fat, salt, acid"
01:32:06;01:32:07;"Right"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Like all in one salad"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Well also, I wonder if salads were kind of new"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Like I don't, like"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"People crushing, is like Daniel Plainview"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"In the fictional universe of"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"There Will Be Blood"
01:32:19;01:32:20;"They're just straight up eating"
01:32:20;01:32:21;"Steak, potatoes"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"They're just eating a head of lettuce"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"There's no dressing"
01:32:25;01:32:28;"I don't know, I feel like salads is"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"My guess is that a salad is like a"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Relatively new thing"
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Actually Jake, you know"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"I'm digging around here a little bit"
01:32:36;01:32:39;"Apparently these date back to the Greek and Roman era"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"With just mixed greens with dressing"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"Not as refined obviously as the Caesar"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"But I will say that before you"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"You know, identified that history"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I thought, like Julius Caesar"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Like I thought this was like a historic"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Centuries old"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Right?"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"I was like, oh, this is like a"
01:32:57;01:33:00;"Fundamental meal"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"That dates back to the Roman era"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"You know what?"
01:33:03;01:33:04;"I kind of assume that too"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"And you know who didn't help?"
01:33:07;01:33:11;"You know who didn't help with this fake news?"
01:33:11;01:33:12;"Who?"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Beloved Hollywood star Paul Newman"
01:33:14;01:33:18;"Because Newman's own Caesar salad dressing"
01:33:18;01:33:21;"There's been different labels over the years"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"But it always, it was some version of Paul Newman"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"Yes"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"What would you say?"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Laurels"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"Right"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"A laurel wreath in his hair"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"As if he was a Roman citizen"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"And I'm looking now, there's a version"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"That even goes a step further"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"And depicts Paul Newman"
01:33:39;01:33:43;"As a Greek, or let's say a Roman statue"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"With a golden laurel in his hair"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"And I gotta say, I'm outraged"
01:33:50;01:33:53;"I'm disgusted that"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"About this ahistoricity"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"But who knows?"
01:33:58;01:34:02;"Maybe Caesar Cardini"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"As a proud man of Italian descent"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Wouldn't particularly be mad"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"At having his creation connected to"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"The famous Roman Empire"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"I'm sure he was cool with it"
01:34:14;01:34:17;"No, I mean"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"You're right though, if you think about it"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"All those ingredients would have been readily available"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"You would think, in like upper crust Roman society"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Of like, I don't know about what the produce situation was"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"But like, definitely some sort of version of Parmesan cheese"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"Eggs, lemons"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"I don't know about a Worcestershire sauce"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"But you know, some version"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"Of like, there must have been people"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Like 500 years ago"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Taking eggs and cheese and like somehow"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Combining them with like"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Greens of some sort"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"To answer your question about sort of"
01:34:52;01:34:56;"The etymology of salad and pre-20s salad"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"1920s salad"
01:34:58;01:35:01;"It's a term derived from the Latin sal, salt"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Which yielded salata, salted things"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Such as raw vegetables"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"So the etymology, the key ingredient of salad"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"And the reason for it getting its name"
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Is the dressing"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"The Romans were enthusiastic eaters of salad"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"Many of their different"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Differing hardly at all from the present day ones"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"A simple selection of raw vegetables"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"So that's, I think it was just probably"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Mostly just like"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Raw vegetables plus something, some kind of salty"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Sauce"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"So it's probably just like carrots or beet"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"You know, like literally just probably not"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Arranged in any particularly"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Raw and salty"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"Yep"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Right, because every culture eats vegetables"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Every culture uses salt"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"But do they do it raw?"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Were they health conscious?"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Were they eating it because they were like"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"Oh, this is good for us?"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"Or was it like a treat?"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"You know, was it like a"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Ooh, this delicious lettuce, like"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"I'm picturing it being sort of"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"The upper crust of society"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Okay, it's a privilege"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"I don't know anything"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"I'm totally speculating"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"I'm picturing like a surf in like"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Imperial Rome"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Just like eating bread"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"Yeah, or just"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Potatoes or whatever"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"Famously there's that phrase"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"Bread in circuses, it's how you keep the"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"The working class"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"Occupied"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"It's not salad and music"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"So here, I just want to"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"I want to say, so basically this is just"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"People just straight up eating raw vegetables"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"Calling it salad until the 19th century"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"The domestic science"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"Slash home economics"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Movement took hold"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Proponents of this new science were obsessed with control"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"So this is the 19th, this is the 1800s"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"They considered tossed plates of mixed greens"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"Messy and eschewed them"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"In favor of orderly presentations"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"So"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"It was just like sort of just a bunch of"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Vegetables in a bowl and then all of a sudden"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"They're like, oh, we got to prepare this"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"And that's I think where you're going to get the salad"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"That's going to start in the, you know"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"What we would consider salad"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Probably 1800s"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"So you're saying that a plate"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Of salad, what before"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"The 19th century is like"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"Just like a sloppily"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Like not a mixed salad"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"It's just kind of chunk of"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Straight up eating raw vegetables and that's"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Called a salad, with salt"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Can I get a side salad please?"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"[Laughter]"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"I'll have a whiskey and"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"A whiskey and a steak"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"And potatoes for the boy"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"And a side salad"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"[Laughter]"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"This is a good one"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"This is a founding fathers accent"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"I'm trying to do Daniel Plainview"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"That was Daniel, I got it"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"Oh I see, I apologize"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"I'm trying to do"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"1891"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Daniel Plainview"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Oil speculator"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"Yes, okay I'm caught up"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Do you call raw carrots"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Raw carrots without"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"Addressing a salad?"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"[Laughter]"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"I want an orderly presentation"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Do you have a soured cream?"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"A soured cream"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"[Laughter]"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"I drink your dressing"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"[Laughter]"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"I know all about it"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"I would take a gun"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"I'd put some poison in a salad"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"And it wouldn't be"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"So bad, it wouldn't hurt"
01:38:28;01:38:30;"The world, look what you did"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"You make a killer of a"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"Jewish girl"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"[Applause]"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"And you did it to a lady"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Oh you have a family"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"How does someone end up"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"With a stone in a chest cavity"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"It wouldn't be so bad"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"It wouldn't hurt"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"The world, look what you did"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Now I'm asleep, I am a murderer"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"It doesn't happen"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"To women, I know"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"I'm hiding in a box"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"In a TV show"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"It doesn't happen"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"To women, I know"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Oh you tell me"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"Why did he hurt"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"My girl"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"Salads really have come a long way"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"I mean, yeah, there's the"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"The wedge salad"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Salad talk"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"You listen to salad talk"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"This is, we're breaking new ground though for TC"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"It's awesome"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"By getting into salads"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"We're out of corporate food, we're just into like, kind of culinary history"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"[Laughter]"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"Next week, history of the noodle"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"Yeah, we just started having"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Chefs on"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"Cooking show, recipes"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Five years from now"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"We're doing a two-parter on the history of Hollandaise sauce"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"[Laughter]"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I mean, I know"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"I've had this conversation a million times"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"Anytime I meet anybody as a chef"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Or works in a kitchen, I'm always like"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"In the French kitchen system"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"You start out learning"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"How to make like, a series"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"There's like five fundamental sauces"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"That you learn how to make"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"And I can never remember what they are"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"Because I've never heard of most of them"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"I think one of them might be a Hollandaise"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"But there's five fundamental"
01:40:16;01:40:18;"Five fundamental French sauces"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"That you learn, and maybe"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"There's some almost like military thing"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"Where you start as a saucier"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"And then you work your way up to chef"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"Painfully, does that sound right?"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Oh, totally"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"I'm picturing you spending like three years"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Like, taking peas"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Out of the pod or something"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Just like, real like"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Karate kid stuff"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Exactly, and then you have the"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"The bear, like the flashbacks"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"In the first season of the bear"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"The mean chef probably like"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"""Let me see your Hollandaise"""
01:40:50;01:40:52;"It's probably like, whiplash style"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"And just like, takes a bite"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Throws it against the wall"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"You're back to shucking oysters"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"You f***ing idiot"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"You're trash, you'll never be anything"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"But it is a little bit like"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"A kung fu movie"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"Like, you're in a temple"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"And then you come back and like, finally"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"After like five years, your Hollandaise sauce"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"He's like, ""Decent"""
01:41:14;01:41:16;"You move on to the second sauce"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"You finally become a chef"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"When you're like, 41"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"I think that's how it works"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"You have to master"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"The five sauces"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"It really is like the"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"The 36 chambers"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Isn't there a scene in like, Bear Season 2"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"Where like, one of those dudes has to like"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"Napkins or whatever for like"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Three weeks or something?"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"He has to clean forks"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Oh right, right, something, like yeah, polish forks"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"That really is kung fu movie s***"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"They're always making the dudes like"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Clean up like the cafeteria for the older monks"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"And have to do like"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Absurd"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"Seemingly mundane work"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"But like, low-key it's teaching you"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"How to master"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Your soul"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"Discipline, yeah, and then you realize like"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"Wait a second"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"I actually do know how to fight"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"I'm ready, and it's like, wait, I do know how to cook"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"I've been shucking oysters for four years"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Suddenly I'm like a kung fu master"
01:42:12;01:42:16;"What a crazy job"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Um"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"For the final segment of today's Time Crisis"
01:42:20;01:42:22;"We won't be doing the top five"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"We'll get back into that next time"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"But we got a very nice email"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"From"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"Alpha Blob"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Hello Crisis Crew"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Just writing in to let you guys know of some info"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"That I think would be relevant to the Time Crisis universe"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Firstly, RM"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Kim Namjoon"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"Of BTS shared Capricorn"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"On his Instagram story"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Attached pic"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"I was aware of this, a friend of mine sent me"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"A screenshot of the Instagram story"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Which I think I shared with the crew"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"You did, yeah"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"And that was very exciting to know"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"RM is not only a member"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"Of BTS"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"My understanding is that he's"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"A major creative force"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"In the organization"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Maybe like a"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"One of the songwriter"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"Producer, you know, like"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Because they're very involved in making their own music"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"So I've always heard"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Specifically things about RM"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"And RM's"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Creativity"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"So I thought that was cool"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"Congrats on this long overdue TCU crossover"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"Especially notable"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"Is that RM is currently conscripted"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"And is only allowed a small time"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Of phone time at the end of the day"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"And is using part of that time"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"To find and listen to VW's music"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"And this part is wild"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Because I didn't know that when I first saw it"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"I was aware that"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Part of why BTS is on hiatus"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Is because"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Certain members are doing their military service"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"And"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"I don't know a ton about it"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"But like"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"My understanding is that"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"In Korea there's"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"You know"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"K-pop star or not"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"You do your service and you do it for real"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Did we not talk about this with a cross"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"Like a alt timeline of"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Our"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"A built to spill"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"This sounds so familiar"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"It was a freaky Friday"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"This is news to me"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"We may have had a freaky Friday"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"Like Marsha built to spill"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"Has to go do military service in Korea"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"That sounds vaguely familiar"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"But I guess I'd heard that"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"Members of BTS of course"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"South Korean citizens have to go do their"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Military service"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"But you know you hear something like that"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"You don't really know what it's like"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"Necessarily"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"And then a friend of mine sent me"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"A picture or a video"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Of RM"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"In seemingly in like the military"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Marching band playing saxophone"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Which"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"As a fellow saxophonist I salute him"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"But suddenly seeing that I was like"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Oh this is like serious"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"You know I don't know I guess you could imagine"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Not knowing a lot about the culture"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Like okay the big star"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Has to do their military service"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"They're gonna be kind of like"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Posted up in some like office job"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"But then seeing him in like this like"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"I don't know everything about it"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Just like was very"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Seemed very serious"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"He's doing boot camp"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"And to get this email"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Which I guess the BTS"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Who notably have extremely passionate fans"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"They know all about this stuff"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"So it's not just that RM is in"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"In the army"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"But is only allowed a small amount of phone time"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"At the end of the day"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Implying that yeah I guess that makes sense"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"If you're running like a serious military operation"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"You can't have everybody"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Posting all the time"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Looking at their phones"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"So anyway that was a touching detail"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"That's cool that RM was"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Throwing on some VW music"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"And posting about it"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"He's just like lying on his cot"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Yeah just like a giant"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"Room camp"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Yeah just a room with like 80 guys in it"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"I think it might be like that"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Like yeah no special favors for the stars"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Just like full metal jacket"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Yeah intense"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"I mean it makes me really curious"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"About this mandatory"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"Military service"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"Like what does it look like what does it feel like"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"I'm very curious about it now"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"But anyway shout out to RM for using that small amount"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Of phone time to"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Check out Capricorn and post"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"Contrast back to the email"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Contrast this with Doug Marsh"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Who is currently not performing"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"Forced labor"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"And as far as anyone's aware has not yet listened to Aguil"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"This information can be"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"Expressed by the data in the chart seen below"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"And this person"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Made a chart"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"BTS Idaho"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Zero acknowledgement for Vampire Weekend"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"BTS Korea 1"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Yeah the name of the chart is BTS"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Appreciation and acknowledgement for Vampire Weekend"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"We've only got any love"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"From for Korea"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Okay look fair enough"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"And no diss to Doug Marsh"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"I don't expect him to be checking out Aguil"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"Or know the dubs"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Or be a fan"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"You know I wonder if"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Do you think I'm closer in age to RM"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Than I am to Doug Marsh"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"Can I get a number crunch"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"I bet Doug Marsh"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"That's tough you're 40"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Doug Marsh is probably like 50"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Okay he's 54"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"Alright RM is 29"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Okay you're closer to RM"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Yeah I'm closer in age to RM"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"Alright so"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"29 is kind of late for"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Mandatory military service"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"I'm surprised he didn't check that off the box"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"When he was like 18 19 20"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"I wonder if it's some in at the buzzer"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"S*** like maybe"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"I wonder if you have to get it done by the time you're 30"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"For instance and maybe it's like"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"You got this like you start this"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Band you're grinding"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"You're like there's really something to this"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"I really think BTS could be big"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"Then you get huge"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Focused on your music you become one of the biggest"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Artists in the world and then you like"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"Realize like oh damn"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"I've only got a year and a half left to do my"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Military service"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"Between 18 and 35"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"I mean Elvis did his military service in the 50s"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"And he was born in the 20s too"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"So he must have been"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"You know"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"I think he was born in the 20s"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Maybe he was born in the early 30s"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"He might have been in his late 20s or something"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"Okay so I guess in a sense RM"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Is not waiting until the very last minute"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"But maybe he feels like"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"We got BTS to such an"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Amazing place"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"We can handle two years gone"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"And I'd rather do this now"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"Than... I also wonder if it's like"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"I'm sure it's really hard"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"But maybe"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"I wonder if any of these guys"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Feel like you know what"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"My military service is very hard and challenging"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"But"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Honestly it's a relief"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"From the pressures of super stardom"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"Oh yeah the K-pop system"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"That's a boot camp"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"In itself"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Right I wonder if they'll come out of that just like feeling relaxed"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Who knows I have no idea"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"And then back to the email"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Relatedly on the topic of forklift certification"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"Another member of BTS Korea"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Is legitimately forklift certified"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Suga?"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"Suga I think"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Suga"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Has what's called a class 1 driver's license in Korea"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"This allows him to operate vehicles which include"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"But are not limited to passenger cars"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Or buses with seating capacity"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Of up to 15"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"That's good for driving the guys around"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Trucks with a maximum"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Loading capacity of 12 tons"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"That's a lot"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Motorcycles up to 125cc"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Don't have a lot of context"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"For that and forklifts with a maximum"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Loading capacity of 3 tons"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Additionally"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"Suga acquired his license not because"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Of a gimmick"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"But out of necessity"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"He worked a number of part time jobs in the early days of BTS"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"To make ends meet"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"In his own words from an interview in 2021"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"When I had my part time work at 20"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Our team was on the verge of being broken apart"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"The label barely had any money left"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"It was a really bad situation"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"So we were unsure whether we could debut"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"So I thought I should do anything I could"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Obviously everything worked out in the end"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Um"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Thank you so much"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"This is uh"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"From Alpha Blob who's been loving Agwa"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"Really enjoyed the TC and Austin visual episode"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Hope you guys are well and thanks for reading"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Thanks for your great email Alpha Blob"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"And for future reference when the dubs go back to Korea"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"To perform on Music Bank"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"Or guest on Su Twitter"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"The name of the city"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"Is pronounced Incheon not Incheon"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"Oh yeah cause I was probably talking about"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"Playing that festival Pentaport"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Which I thought was in Incheon"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"But now I know it's Incheon"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"That's also where like the big airport is"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"Um thank you for that great email"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"And um"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"You know"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Doug I would appreciate if you check out Agwa"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"I think you might like"
