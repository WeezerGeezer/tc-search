00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again in 2020."
00:03;00:11;"On today's very special episode, Jake and I unite, and for the first time, we talk to Chris Kasky,"
00:11;00:16;"a co-founder of Pitchfork Music Festival and the writer of the infamous Jet Review."
00:16;00:22;"We also talk to Amy Brown, former Wendy's social media specialist, and hear about her wild ride"
00:22;00:25;"when it came to virality and savagely clapping back."
00:26;00:31;"This is a 2020 Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:38;"[intro]"
01:20;01:24;"Time Crisis, back again. First show of 2020. What's up, Jake?"
01:24;01:28;"Happy New Year. Kind of late in the year to be saying that, but that's fine."
01:28;01:32;"Should we discuss it? That's kind of a really cliched thing to talk about."
01:32;01:32;"Yeah."
01:32;01:37;"We're not joined in the studio by Seinfeld. He's still abroad, I think, but it's a pretty"
01:37;01:42;"Seinfeld thing. In fact, I bet there is an episode of Curb that's just like, ""You know what,"
01:42;01:43;"January 15th?"""
01:43;01:44;"It's too late."
01:44;01:44;"It's too late."
01:44;01:50;"Well, because it's the first show of the year, kind of saying happy New Year to the TC crew."
01:50;01:53;"Yeah, I think it's appropriate."
01:53;01:54;"People on Twitter were upset that-"
01:54;01:56;"Up in arms."
01:56;02:00;"The first episode isn't airing until, I don't know, what, three weeks in?"
02:00;02:03;"With the biweekly show, it's kind of funky."
02:03;02:03;"Yeah."
02:03;02:05;"And also I was in Australia."
02:05;02:06;"Right."
02:06;02:11;"I was there for New Year's, even though our New Year's show was canceled."
02:11;02:12;"Due to a fire?"
02:12;02:17;"Due to the fires. We had four shows booked as part of this thing called Falls Festival,"
02:17;02:21;"kind of like a traveling festival where the artists go from place to place."
02:21;02:23;"And then we had two of our own shows."
02:23;02:27;"But so the show for New Year's, and we were supposed to be on stage counting down,"
02:27;02:34;"probably would have ripped some confetti, probably been like, ""Three, two, one, happy New Year."""
02:34;02:40;"Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's what we did last time we were down there for New Year's."
02:40;02:42;"Whatever, we would have had a ball."
02:42;02:48;"But that show was in a place called Lorne, which is in Victoria, which is the state where Melbourne"
02:48;02:50;"is, but it's not really close to Melbourne."
02:50;02:54;"I have a memory of just being in a van for hours to get there."
02:54;02:59;"But I think the way it was explained to us is there actually were already campers on site,"
02:59;03:02;"but it's not that that area was already on fire."
03:02;03:05;"It's just that the fires in the region were so out of control."
03:05;03:11;"And that area was so vulnerable because it's some kind of small town, one road in,"
03:11;03:14;"one road out through the hills or the mountains to the beach or something."
03:14;03:18;"And they're just like, ""Listen, it's not a situation where we could,"
03:18;03:21;"if the fires get within a hundred miles, we could just be like, 'You know what? Pack it up."
03:21;03:25;"It would be a disaster getting people in and out. It's way too dangerous.'"""
03:25;03:28;"And I was really into the idea of performing on New Year's."
03:28;03:30;"It's kind of like, ""You know what? Less to think about."
03:30;03:32;"Just be down there playing a great show."""
03:32;03:33;"Working."
03:33;03:34;"Just working."
03:34;03:37;"I love the idea of working on New Year's and also sharing the joy of music,"
03:37;03:39;"but very specifically working."
03:39;03:40;"I think I would feel somewhat..."
03:40;03:46;"Obviously, it's very different playing a concert versus just working at 7-Eleven."
03:46;03:49;"But I actually kind of think if I worked at 7-Eleven and somebody was like,"
03:49;03:51;"""Who wants New Year's shift?"" I'd be like, ""Let me do that one."""
03:51;03:52;"And then everybody would be like, ""What do you have planned?"""
03:52;03:54;"I'd be like, ""I'm working."""
03:54;03:54;"I feel you."
03:54;03:58;"Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder what the vibe is like in a typical 7-Eleven"
03:58;04:00;"as the clock strikes midnight."
04:00;04:04;"People late to parties, picking up 12 packs."
04:04;04:06;"""Oh my God, it's 11 and 58!"""
04:06;04:10;"Yeah, a dude holding the 18-pack of Modelo that I'm looking at right now,"
04:10;04:12;"just holding an 18-pack of Modelo."
04:12;04:14;"And he just kind of looks at the sales clerk."
04:14;04:19;"And then there's some older dude in pajama bottoms and a sweatshirt."
04:19;04:22;"Everybody just kind of looks at each other just like, ""Ugh!"""
04:22;04:23;"Just getting a hot dog."
04:23;04:24;"""Happy New Year."""
04:24;04:25;"Yeah, also it's funny."
04:25;04:29;"When you're not in a party situation or in a formal event,"
04:29;04:31;"because this is kind of what ended up happening to me,"
04:31;04:33;"if you're not where there's an official countdown,"
04:33;04:36;"I guess maybe somebody might have the TV on in a convenience store."
04:36;04:40;"But there's also that vibe of just kind of like nobody actually counted it down."
04:40;04:42;"So it's like the clock just struck midnight."
04:42;04:45;"The guy with the Modelo is like, ""Oh, yeah, happy New Year."""
04:45;04:45;"He's like, ""Oh, is it?"""
04:45;04:47;"He pulls out his phone."
04:47;04:49;"""Yep, actually it's 12.01."""
04:49;04:49;"Well, s***."
04:49;04:53;"Or maybe the TV is on in the convenience store."
04:53;04:55;"And then these strangers are just like, ""Are we doing this?"
04:55;04:58;"Are we doing a real half-assed countdown?"""
04:58;04:59;"It's just a line of three people."
04:59;05:00;"""Seven, six."""
05:00;05:01;"""Can I get a hot dog?"
05:01;05:03;"Five, four."""
05:03;05:07;"You just imagine you're fourth in line at Quick Check."
05:07;05:08;"And just you see it on TV."
05:08;05:10;"And just like everybody's kind of quiet."
05:10;05:11;"Just like doing, you know."
05:11;05:13;"""Yeah, can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds?"""
05:13;05:16;"And you're just like, ""Nine, eight, seven, six."""
05:16;05:24;"A few years ago, I was in line at a Best Western check-in in Honolulu, Hawaii."
05:24;05:25;"At New Year."
05:25;05:27;"Yes."
05:27;05:28;"This was on our trip."
05:28;05:30;"Yes, we took a trip to Hawaii."
05:30;05:30;"Oh, yeah."
05:30;05:34;"And then Hannah and I were flying back New Year's Eve for some reason."
05:34;05:36;"I don't know why we were doing that, but we were."
05:36;05:37;"That was a fun vacation in Hawaii."
05:37;05:38;"Yep."
05:38;05:40;"Jake and Hannah, me and Rashid, Ariel and Danielle."
05:40;05:41;"It was a great crew."
05:41;05:41;"Yep."
05:41;05:44;"I believe it was one of those situations where you guys had plans in LA."
05:44;05:46;"So we were all kind of like, ""Yo, stay."
05:46;05:47;"Yo, just stay."""
05:47;05:48;"And you guys were like, ""You know what?"
05:48;05:49;"We got plans in LA."
05:49;05:50;"We've had fun."
05:50;05:52;"But we're going to catch that early flight back."
05:52;05:55;"And that way we can go to the party or whatever in Los Angeles."""
05:55;05:58;"We were going to land at like 7 p.m."
05:58;05:59;"It was a reasonable plan."
05:59;05:59;"New Year's Eve."
05:59;06:01;"Totally reasonable."
06:01;06:02;"And then we're on the flight."
06:02;06:05;"We're a good like three hours into the flight over the Pacific."
06:05;06:10;"And they're like, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're turning the plane back around to Honolulu."
06:10;06:12;"We have a mechanical issue."""
06:12;06:14;"And that's stressful."
06:14;06:15;"And it's just like, ""Really?"""
06:15;06:19;"So then it's like, ""Turn it around three hours back to Honolulu."""
06:19;06:25;"And then, so we get to Honolulu and it's like, I don't know, like 11, 15 p.m. at night."
06:25;06:28;"And then there's a whole, because there's a whole plane full of people trying to get"
06:28;06:30;"hotel rooms in Honolulu."
06:30;06:34;"There's a huge backup, the hotel shuttle, get to the hotel."
06:34;06:37;"Anyway, I just remember like standing in line."
06:37;06:38;"At the Best Western."
06:38;06:40;"It's like 11.58."
06:40;06:41;"This is literally you."
06:41;06:42;"You were in line in a public place."
06:42;06:44;"Was there a countdown happening?"
06:44;06:45;"There was no countdown."
06:45;06:51;"It was like a very dejected listless energy in the Best Western hotel lobby."
06:51;06:53;"And you must've been so burned out."
06:53;06:54;"We were bummed."
06:54;06:56;"And then, I mean, that sucks."
06:56;06:58;"Were you even aware when the clock struck midnight?"
06:58;06:59;"I think so."
06:59;07:00;"I think we were like standing in line."
07:00;07:03;"Do you not think of like standing in line and looking at your phone?"
07:03;07:03;"Yeah."
07:03;07:04;"Kind of zoned out."
07:04;07:06;"I've been there."
07:06;07:07;"Oh, it's 11.58."
07:07;07:10;"This sounds like something I may have talked about on TC before, but I remember one time"
07:10;07:13;"being in California."
07:13;07:14;"I was up in Palo Alto."
07:14;07:16;"I was staying with my girlfriend at the time."
07:16;07:18;"And I don't know if we were like jet lag."
07:18;07:22;"I can't remember what was going on, but I remember like hanging out at her family's"
07:22;07:26;"house and we were like thinking about driving into San Francisco on a holiday with traffic."
07:26;07:28;"Like that's a solid 50."
07:28;07:28;"Sure."
07:28;07:29;"Palo Alto into SF."
07:29;07:30;"Oh yeah."
07:30;07:33;"I think there was like some kind of thing that sounded like decent, but kind of lame."
07:33;07:35;"Just like a bunch of people are going to be at a bar."
07:35;07:38;"Those are so rough."
07:38;07:42;"It just feels like we're like, well, it's 9.30 PM and we're just kind of like, should"
07:42;07:42;"we do it?"
07:42;07:44;"And it's kind of tired."
07:44;07:46;"And basically we ended up going to sleep and sleeping through New Year's."
07:46;07:48;"And I remember waking up being like, that was the right call."
07:48;07:51;"I don't regret it at all."
07:51;07:54;"And I kind of feel like starting the year on the right note, rested."
07:54;07:59;"This past year, we were watching the film, The Departed."
07:59;08:00;"Oh, good."
08:00;08:00;"And looked at..."
08:00;08:01;"That's a good movie."
08:01;08:04;"Looked at my phone and I was like, oh, it's like 12.06."
08:04;08:04;"Cool."
08:04;08:06;"Wait, wait, you mean like..."
08:06;08:07;"Like a few weeks ago."
08:07;08:08;"Two weeks ago?"
08:08;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:10;"We were with some other friends."
08:10;08:10;"Yeah."
08:10;08:13;"Jack Nicholson is like giving a monologue and you're just like..."
08:13;08:17;"It's like John Lennon said, I'm an artist."
08:17;08:20;"You give me a tuba, I'll get you something out of it."
08:20;08:24;"It's like that really stressful moment when like Matt Damon's like sending a text in his"
08:24;08:26;"pocket and it's like..."
08:26;08:27;"And you're just like..."
08:27;08:31;"Five, four, three, two, one."
08:31;08:49;"So anyway, I was looking forward to working."
08:49;08:50;"Right."
08:50;08:53;"But of course, the fires out there is a total nightmare."
08:53;08:54;"So and I'm obviously..."
08:54;08:59;"Nobody could fault the festival for putting safety first when things are so out of control."
08:59;09:02;"So of course, you didn't think twice about that part of it."
09:02;09:04;"But then it's kind of like, all right, so what are we doing?"
09:04;09:09;"And so we were just like in this hotel in Melbourne and people worked hard to like feel"
09:09;09:13;"like, well, where's a place where the whole band and crew can go and grab some pizza and"
09:13;09:13;"brews?"
09:13;09:17;"And they found like a cool rooftop bar where you could see the fireworks because they have"
09:17;09:22;"like fireworks that are like in the city, set off the top of buildings in like the downtown"
09:22;09:24;"central business district of Melbourne."
09:24;09:25;"Huh."
09:25;09:25;"But then..."
09:25;09:26;"Seems dicey."
09:26;09:28;"I don't think they would let people do that in New York."
09:28;09:29;"What else about the fires?"
09:29;09:34;"Well, it was, that was the topic of conversation because Melbourne, a lot of places have fireworks"
09:34;09:35;"in New Year's, right?"
09:35;09:39;"And Sydney actually is like the very famous ones, you know, down in the harbor by the"
09:39;09:39;"opera house."
09:39;09:44;"Sydney pops off for New Year's and you know, whatever, just being in Australia, naturally"
09:44;09:47;"talk to people and you see some of the national press and stuff."
09:47;09:51;"And there was a lot of like, people were so mad at the prime minister, Scott Morrison."
09:51;09:52;"So people were like..."
09:52;09:53;"He was on vacation somewhere?"
09:53;09:54;"Yeah."
09:54;09:56;"There's a lot of things people were criticizing him about."
09:56;10:00;"And then there's this vibe of kind of like, and you're really going to do like the Sydney"
10:00;10:05;"fireworks when tens or hundreds of thousands of people are like fighting for their lives"
10:05;10:06;"or losing their homes."
10:06;10:08;"And people were just like, it's in bad taste."
10:08;10:10;"So full band and crew hangout?"
10:10;10:11;"Full band and crew hangout."
10:11;10:12;"Night off."
10:12;10:12;"That sounds kind of..."
10:12;10:13;"It's a night off."
10:13;10:14;"Sounds kind of fun."
10:14;10:15;"It's kind of fun."
10:15;10:19;"But then you also like know you have so much coming up and there's so much travel involved"
10:19;10:20;"in Australia that it's like..."
10:20;10:21;"Yeah."
10:21;10:26;"And also I think because we knew why the festivals were canceled, you know, it's like"
10:26;10:29;"a weird energy in the air, I think."
10:29;10:29;"Yeah."
10:29;10:30;"Although, you know, you wouldn't..."
10:30;10:34;"It felt kind of like business as usual on the streets of Melbourne."
10:34;10:38;"When we finally came to play our own show in Melbourne, we had some technical issues."
10:38;10:42;"And the first couple of times the power went out, we had to like leave the stage."
10:42;10:46;"We're on like song three, playing Cape Cod and the power goes out once."
10:46;10:48;"And then the crew is kind of like, you guys should walk off stage."
10:48;10:48;"We're going to take them out."
10:48;10:50;"We're like, all right, guys, we'll be right back."
10:50;10:50;"We're going to fix this."
10:50;10:52;"Was this indoors or outdoors?"
10:52;10:52;"Indoors."
10:52;10:54;"And then it happened again."
10:54;10:57;"And we walk off stage and like our crew is kind of like, listen, we got one last thing"
10:57;10:58;"we can try to make this work."
10:58;11:01;"And I was just standing there being like, if this show can't happen."
11:01;11:03;"And we had like these like hardcore fans there."
11:03;11:06;"And I was like, oh man, I was like, that's going to be a real bummer."
11:06;11:07;"But it worked out."
11:07;11:07;"It was a good show."
11:07;11:09;"The Sydney show was great too."
11:09;11:10;"Well, welcome home."
11:10;11:11;"Back to the grind."
11:11;11:13;"Back to that TC grind."
11:13;11:14;"Back to the TC grind, man."
11:14;11:17;"I feel good about 2020 though."
11:17;11:20;"Did you make any New Year's resolutions or do you believe you're not allowed to say them?"
11:20;11:22;"No, I didn't make any resolutions."
11:22;11:23;"Did you?"
11:23;11:27;"No, I think this year I was like, you know, I just do all the things you're always putting off."
11:27;11:28;"Exercise, eat better."
11:28;11:29;"Oh yeah."
11:29;11:30;"I'm doing dry January."
11:30;11:31;"Oh yeah."
11:31;11:32;"Which is sort of like an annual event."
11:32;11:35;"This is very unusual that I'm drinking a Modelo and you're not."
11:35;11:35;"That's true."
11:35;11:37;"Roll reversal."
11:37;11:41;"So yeah, dry January, I feel like it's that and no nut November."
11:41;11:45;"I feel like in the past five or six years, they've really become a thing."
11:45;11:50;"I feel like dry January was like very trendy, like two years ago."
11:50;11:56;"I've noticed among my peer group, a lot less enthusiasm around dry January this year."
11:56;11:57;"What do you think that's about?"
11:57;11:59;"I think people are just like, eh, I don't wanna."
11:59;12:00;"I think it's that simple."
12:00;12:03;"I noticed an uptick in tweets that were kind of like, you know,"
12:03;12:05;"forgetting about self-care and wellness."
12:05;12:08;"And it was kind of like 2020, we're doing drugs again."
12:08;12:10;"I feel like that was kind of like a viral tweet."
12:10;12:10;"Interesting."
12:10;12:11;"I was seeing a lot of places."
12:11;12:13;"So maybe there is something that's like."
12:13;12:14;"F it."
12:14;12:15;"The world's on fire."
12:15;12:17;"Maybe this is kind of an F it year."
12:17;12:22;"I also just feel like I can only speak for myself, but I feel like my adult life has been"
12:22;12:26;"watching the wellness health industry just like grow and grow."
12:26;12:30;"There are a couple of Whole Foods near the town I grew up in, in Jersey."
12:30;12:32;"There's like a couple in Montclair, New Jersey."
12:32;12:33;"And I was always kind of like, yeah, you know,"
12:33;12:36;"it's like a slightly healthier supermarket."
12:36;12:39;"And I remember like when I got to college in the city,"
12:39;12:44;"it was right around when like some notable big Whole Foods opened in Manhattan."
12:44;12:46;"There was like the big one at Union."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah, there was the Union Square one."
12:47;12:51;"And there's also the big one at Columbus Circle in the Time Warner building."
12:51;12:53;"And I just kind of remember even at the time,"
12:53;12:55;"and I remember people were just like, oh, sick."
12:55;12:56;"We've got an awesome hot bar."
12:56;12:58;"And I remember even at the time being like, wait, this is like suburban."
12:58;13:00;"People like hyped on this."
13:00;13:01;"Totally."
13:01;13:03;"But then I was kind of like, oh, it's the Whole Foods era."
13:03;13:05;"At the time, I didn't know any of the backstory."
13:05;13:09;"And then I just kind of feel like between that and like various new ways of eating"
13:09;13:14;"and the kind of like rise of healthy food startups that happen a lot,"
13:14;13:16;"like, yeah, we're like disrupting this or that."
13:16;13:19;"And here's the version that has ancient grains or whatever."
13:19;13:21;"I just feel like there's been more and more of that stuff."
13:21;13:23;"I feel like there's been some times that like really random airports."
13:23;13:27;"And I just like walked into the, you know, like the Hudson News equivalent,"
13:27;13:32;"where back in the day, if you wanted to eat something like quote unquote healthy,"
13:32;13:36;"just be like, well, I'm not going to eat a f***ing KitKat right now."
13:36;13:37;"I guess I'll get the, uh,"
13:37;13:39;"- This bag of peanuts. - The salted cashews."
13:39;13:41;"Right?"
13:41;13:42;"And a diet Snapple."
13:42;13:46;"Oh, rough stuff."
13:46;13:48;"And now you go in there, I'm willing to believe this is still not healthy,"
13:48;13:51;"but you would go into these places and it'd just be like,"
13:51;13:56;"well, we got six types of paleo bars, kale chips, you know, like you find that all over the place."
13:56;13:58;"It's not a coastal thing at all."
13:58;13:59;"It's just very omnipresent."
14:00;14:02;"I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets,"
14:02;14:05;"only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat."
14:05;14:06;"I'm from the old school."
14:06;14:08;"My household smell like soul food, bruh."
14:08;14:14;"Curry falafel, barbecue tofu, no fish dough, no candy bars, no cigarettes,"
14:14;14:17;"only ganja, fresh squeezed juice from oranges."
14:17;14:19;"Exercise and daily to stay healthy."
14:19;14:22;"And I rarely drink water out the tap because it's filthy."
14:22;14:28;"Lentil soup is mental fruit and ginger root is good for the youth."
14:28;14:33;"Fresh vegetable with them ital stew, sweet yam fries with the green callilu."
14:33;14:37;"Careful how you season and prepare your foods because you don't want to lose"
14:37;14:38;"vitamins and minerals."
14:38;14:40;"And that's the jewel."
14:40;14:40;"Life brings life."
14:40;14:41;"It's valuable."
14:41;14:43;"So I eat what comes from the ground."
14:43;14:44;"It's natural."
14:44;14:46;"Let your food be your medicine."
14:46;14:47;"No excetera."
14:47;14:48;"Strictly herb generation."
14:48;14:52;"The sun because I got melanin and drink water, eight glasses a day."
14:52;14:54;"Because that's what they say."
14:55;14:58;"They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy."
14:58;15:01;"My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy."
15:01;15:04;"Because true wealth comes from good health and wise ways."
15:04;15:06;"We got to start taking better care of ourselves."
15:06;15:10;"They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy."
15:10;15:12;"My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy."
15:12;15:15;"Because true wealth comes from good health and wise ways."
15:15;15:18;"We got to start taking better care of ourselves."
15:18;15:19;"Be healthy, y'all."
15:19;15:22;"I feel like there is kind of a turn to just being like,"
15:22;15:23;"""F*** it, let me get a Big Mac."""
15:23;15:26;"And maybe it also has to do with the global mood."
15:26;15:29;"Climate change, there's a lot of reasons to feel pessimistic."
15:29;15:32;"But I also have a feeling that there's probably a lot of people who,"
15:32;15:34;"five to six years ago, were like, ""Holy s***,"
15:34;15:38;"they just opened a new kind of lunch place in my town,"
15:38;15:40;"and you can get like a quinoa bowl."
15:40;15:42;"And yeah, finally, I don't have to go f***ing eat"
15:42;15:44;"Angela's sub shop for lunch anymore."""
15:44;15:47;"And then I have a feeling like probably like five years on,"
15:47;15:49;"people are just like, ""Do I feel any better?"
15:49;15:50;"I don't know, man."
15:50;15:51;"Do I?"
15:51;15:52;"Am I any healthier?"
15:52;15:55;"And by the way, I'm not advocating that people don't eat healthy at all."
15:55;15:57;"I just have a feeling that a lot of what was sold to people"
15:57;15:59;"as a healthier lifestyle,"
15:59;16:01;"some of which was probably real,"
16:01;16:05;"and some of which was kind of branded disruption nonsense."
16:05;16:07;"I just feel like what that all adds up to"
16:07;16:11;"is probably a decent number of people feeling a little burned out"
16:11;16:14;"and being like, ""Man, I remember that moment when,"
16:14;16:16;"yeah, the new lunch spot opened,"
16:16;16:19;"or when I started placing my Amazon order"
16:19;16:23;"to get these special hemp fig bars"
16:23;16:24;"that were like,"
16:24;16:27;"I was going to eat them instead of Butterfingers for my snacks and blah."""
16:27;16:28;"And I just feel like there's a lot of..."
16:28;16:31;"Maybe I'm partially this person,"
16:31;16:34;"but I just feel like there's probably a bit of exhaustion"
16:34;16:36;"that's just like, ""Well, you know what, man?"
16:36;16:37;"The revolution didn't come."""
16:37;16:40;"I mean, not to get all Michael Pollan on it,"
16:40;16:42;"but it's like, or pollen,"
16:42;16:42;"but it's like,"
16:42;16:45;"if you're just eating the processed vegan version"
16:45;16:48;"of hamburgers and candy bars,"
16:48;16:49;"you're going to feel the same."
16:49;16:53;"You have to actually eat raw vegetables."
16:53;16:54;"Yeah, that's tough."
16:54;16:55;"I know, it's a bummer."
16:55;16:57;"It's not a fun hang,"
16:57;16:59;"just eating carrots."
16:59;17:01;"And you also just got to exercise, I guess."
17:01;17:03;"I went to the gym for the first time in a long time today."
17:03;17:04;"How'd it feel?"
17:04;17:06;"I feel a little better."
17:06;17:07;"I said to the dude I work out with,"
17:07;17:08;"I was like, ""You know what, man?"""
17:08;17:09;"'Cause he always says,"
17:09;17:11;"it's always embarrassing."
17:11;17:12;"What are your goals?"
17:12;17:14;"Well, he's known me for a long time"
17:14;17:16;"and he's seen me very little the past year,"
17:16;17:17;"so he'll always be like,"
17:17;17:18;"""How's it been going on the road?"""
17:19;17:19;"Like workout wise."
17:19;17:21;"Yeah, like, ""Have you been working out?"""
17:21;17:22;"And then sometimes, you know,"
17:22;17:24;"we kind of fudge it a little bit."
17:24;17:26;"I mean, I hit the hotel gym that time."
17:26;17:27;"Then I'm thinking like,"
17:27;17:29;"""What did I actually do when I was in there?"""
17:29;17:30;"Listen to seven minutes of a podcast"
17:30;17:33;"and like run a sprint."
17:33;17:34;"And so I said to him,"
17:34;17:35;"I was like, ""You know what, man?"""
17:35;17:36;"And maybe this is a little bit of that"
17:36;17:38;"come to Jesus moment."
17:38;17:40;"And also just because I legitimately"
17:40;17:41;"have felt less healthy"
17:41;17:42;"being on the road for six months."
17:42;17:43;"Sure."
17:43;17:44;"I think it's finally taken a toll on me."
17:44;17:46;"The last couple of tours,"
17:46;17:47;"I was kind of just like,"
17:47;17:49;"and especially touring Australia,"
17:49;17:50;"it's a very healthy country,"
17:50;17:51;"but not for a touring musician"
17:51;17:52;"because you're spending a lot of time"
17:52;17:54;"in the airport lounges,"
17:54;17:55;"just snacking."
17:55;17:57;"You're not out there like rock climbing"
17:57;17:58;"like a real Aussie."
17:58;17:59;"But anyway,"
17:59;18:00;"so I was, you know, I said,"
18:00;18:01;"""You know what, man?"
18:01;18:02;"I'm starting at zero."
18:02;18:03;"I don't feel good."
18:03;18:05;"I don't feel terrible either."""
18:05;18:05;"I was like,"
18:05;18:07;"""Yeah, I mean, like you didn't put on weight or anything."""
18:07;18:08;"I don't know."
18:08;18:09;"I haven't actually gone on the scale in a while."
18:09;18:13;"I saw a picture that I was tagged in on Instagram"
18:13;18:15;"from must've been about a year ago"
18:15;18:17;"is when I sat down with Will Welch from GQ"
18:17;18:18;"to do an interview"
18:18;18:20;"and I'm wearing an eight minute Cape Cod long sleeve."
18:20;18:20;"Oh, I saw that."
18:20;18:21;"And I saw the picture."
18:21;18:22;"It might've been my,"
18:22;18:24;"I don't know if it was like the way I had my arms crossed."
18:24;18:26;"I just looked at myself and I was like,"
18:26;18:27;"""I look healthier."""
18:27;18:28;"I showed it to Rishi and she's like,"
18:28;18:30;"""You look exactly the same."""
18:30;18:30;"But you know what?"
18:30;18:33;"It's not even about like being obsessed"
18:33;18:34;"with the way you look."
18:34;18:35;"I just had this thing."
18:35;18:36;"I looked at myself and I was just like,"
18:36;18:37;"I don't know what I was looking at."
18:37;18:39;"I don't know if it was a sparkle in my eye."
18:39;18:40;"I could see something personal"
18:40;18:41;"where I was like,"
18:41;18:43;"whatever's happening on the outside,"
18:43;18:45;"I could see something in that photo"
18:45;18:45;"that was like,"
18:45;18:48;"there was more of a spark of life in me."
18:48;18:49;"I think you're projecting, man."
18:49;18:50;"But you know how it is."
18:50;18:51;"It's like you can-"
18:51;18:52;"Well, photos are crazy too."
18:52;18:55;"You can look crazy different in photos"
18:55;18:56;"from like the same day."
18:56;19:00;"Just like the one 500th of a second"
19:00;19:02;"that happened to capture you then."
19:02;19:02;"Oh yeah, of course."
19:02;19:05;"But the spark of life is a real thing."
19:05;19:07;"I mean, just cause your brain chemistry changes"
19:07;19:09;"when you exercise a little bit."
19:09;19:09;"Well, I don't know."
19:09;19:11;"Actually, I'm curious about this."
19:11;19:12;"You know?"
19:12;19:13;"The 2020, let's go."
19:13;19:15;"I mean, I'm pro exercise."
19:15;19:16;"Let's go open Kimono."
19:16;19:18;"Let's crack open those books."
19:18;19:19;"Starting 2020 on a like,"
19:19;19:20;"back on the time crisis,"
19:20;19:21;"health and fitness tip."
19:21;19:24;"We're going against the grain."
19:24;19:24;"The people have spoken"
19:24;19:26;"and this is a year of drugs and alcohol,"
19:26;19:27;"but that time crisis,"
19:27;19:28;"we're actually getting back"
19:28;19:29;"into health and fitness."
19:29;19:31;"We're contrarians here."
19:31;19:33;"But this is going to be a wild year."
19:33;19:35;"Whether you're choosing to go the path"
19:35;19:36;"of drugs and alcohol"
19:36;19:37;"or the path of-"
19:37;19:38;"Enlightenment."
19:38;19:40;"Enlightenment, health and fitness."
19:41;19:43;"Either way, it's going to be a wild year"
19:43;19:44;"because it's an election year."
19:44;19:45;"You know, we've-"
19:45;19:47;"A time crisis, I think."
19:47;19:48;"I know."
19:48;19:48;"It's funny though."
19:48;19:50;"A short 11 months away."
19:50;19:52;"I think the true TC heads,"
19:52;19:53;"they know that to some extent,"
19:53;19:56;"even though maybe the most classic stretches of TC"
19:56;19:59;"existed not in election years,"
19:59;20:00;"to some extent,"
20:00;20:03;"the TC sensibility was forged"
20:03;20:06;"in the fires of 2016."
20:06;20:07;"Just because that was like the early days."
20:07;20:09;"I think we made a conscious choice"
20:09;20:12;"to not, especially given our infamous lag"
20:12;20:16;"on covering the news of the day,"
20:16;20:17;"that we're not going to just come in"
20:17;20:18;"and just be like,"
20:18;20:19;"""You know, President Trump."""
20:19;20:21;"You see this about Trump?"
20:21;20:21;"Yeah."
20:21;20:23;"But we have been up to our ears"
20:23;20:25;"in Trump era EDM."
20:25;20:25;"It's funny."
20:25;20:27;"Trump era EDM has kind of like fallen off."
20:27;20:28;"I think maybe at the,"
20:28;20:30;"hopefully next January"
20:30;20:32;"when Bernie's sworn in,"
20:32;20:33;"we can do a look back on the four years"
20:33;20:35;"of Trump era music"
20:35;20:36;"and look at how it changed."
20:36;20:37;"Well, if Sanders wins,"
20:37;20:38;"hopefully we'll get into"
20:38;20:40;"some of that Vermont kind of crunchy."
20:40;20:42;"That's one thing I want to say."
20:42;20:43;"I've been thinking about this."
20:43;20:45;"The only candidate"
20:45;20:46;"who's been out there talking about"
20:46;20:48;"the fact that he listens to Phish"
20:48;20:50;"is unfortunately Mayor Pete."
20:50;20:51;"Oh, really?"
20:51;20:52;"He's a Phish guy?"
20:52;20:53;"Yes."
20:53;20:54;"And I think he even like,"
20:54;20:55;"maybe he made some joke about like"
20:55;20:57;"Phish performing at the inauguration."
20:57;20:58;"But this is also important."
20:58;20:59;"That would be tight."
20:59;21:01;"Of course it would be tight."
21:01;21:02;"But if Sanders won,"
21:02;21:06;"true OG Vermont credibility there."
21:06;21:08;"And I don't know if anybody from Phish"
21:08;21:09;"has endorsed anybody"
21:09;21:10;"and I wouldn't want to put him on the spot,"
21:10;21:11;"but I just feel like"
21:11;21:13;"that's like a classic situation"
21:13;21:15;"where it's like the hardcore fan"
21:15;21:17;"is not always indicative"
21:17;21:19;"of like the larger community."
21:19;21:20;"Sure."
21:20;21:21;"So anyway, I just want to say,"
21:21;21:23;"well, so, okay, you know,"
21:23;21:25;"so Mayor Pete's been to some Phish shows."
21:25;21:27;"In 2016, Phish,"
21:27;21:30;"or at least John Fishman endorsed him."
21:30;21:30;"Bernie."
21:30;21:31;"Yeah."
21:31;21:33;"And Fishman was one of several people."
21:33;21:34;"This is in 2016."
21:34;21:36;"Fishman was one of several people"
21:36;21:37;"Sanders thanked at the top"
21:37;21:39;"of his stump speech in Portland."
21:39;21:40;"He called Phish one of the great bands"
21:40;21:42;"in the country."
21:42;21:42;"Sick."
21:42;21:43;"And he said, let me thank"
21:43;21:45;"one of Vermont's heroes"
21:45;21:47;"who has now transplanted John Fishman."
21:47;21:49;"John and Phish have made New England proud."
21:49;21:51;"They are one of the great bands,"
21:51;21:52;"have been one of the great bands"
21:52;21:53;"in the country."
21:53;21:53;"Okay."
21:53;21:54;"So there, yeah, of course,"
21:54;21:56;"there's a Phish Bernie connection."
21:56;21:57;"I think the thing with Bernie is"
21:57;21:59;"we know very little about his taste in pop culture"
21:59;22:00;"because he has no time"
22:00;22:02;"for that type of jawboning."
22:02;22:04;"Every time he does an interview"
22:04;22:06;"and people try to take it to that place"
22:06;22:08;"of being like, yo, but you know what?"
22:08;22:09;"Give us some like fun color."
22:09;22:11;"He's just like, you know what?"
22:11;22:12;"Here's what I think."
22:12;22:13;"Yeah."
22:13;22:14;"The American people."
22:14;22:16;"Bernie, what'd you think of season two"
22:16;22:16;"of the wire?"
22:16;22:18;"Didn't have time."
22:18;22:18;"Yeah."
22:18;22:21;"Also just John Fishman partially credits"
22:21;22:23;"Bernie Sanders with Phish formation."
22:23;22:24;"Wait, what?"
22:24;22:24;"Okay."
22:24;22:25;"Let's hear about this."
22:25;22:25;"Hold on."
22:25;22:25;"Hold on."
22:25;22:26;"Let's hear about this."
22:26;22:27;"This is at a rally."
22:27;22:28;"2016."
22:28;22:29;"John Fishman spoke."
22:29;22:31;"This must be same main rally."
22:31;22:33;"In the very beginning, this is Fishman."
22:33;22:34;"In the very beginning of our band,"
22:34;22:35;"we grew up in the environment"
22:35;22:37;"that Bernie Sanders was largely responsible for."
22:37;22:39;"Very vibrant, healthy community."
22:39;22:41;"And he supported the arts tremendously."
22:41;22:43;"And, uh, and we, as a band,"
22:43;22:46;"it could be said that we may not have existed."
22:46;22:47;"Had we not grown up in a place,"
22:47;22:49;"I mean, it's a little loose,"
22:49;22:50;"but not growing up in a place"
22:50;22:52;"where the art scene was so vibrant"
22:52;22:54;"that we were able to play five,"
22:54;22:57;"six nights a week up and down main street"
22:57;22:58;"at a whole number of venues."
22:58;22:59;"Tied by it."
22:59;23:03;"I do remember reading a Bernie's book back."
23:03;23:04;"Actually, I remember it's on the same Hawaii trip."
23:04;23:05;"Right?"
23:05;23:06;"I remember you had that."
23:06;23:08;"I remember I was like burning through that Bernie book."
23:08;23:09;"It was from the nineties, right?"
23:09;23:10;"That book was an oldie."
23:10;23:11;"It was from the nineties."
23:11;23:13;"And then they kind of updated it"
23:13;23:15;"to have a little bit about his presidential campaign."
23:15;23:16;"But it really, it was, it was,"
23:16;23:18;"I think it was off the back of like,"
23:18;23:20;"how did this independent dude end up in the house?"
23:20;23:21;"Yeah."
23:21;23:23;"And it was, so he told kind of the story of his life."
23:23;23:26;"But again, as you can imagine with Bernie,"
23:26;23:28;"not like a ton of color, you know,"
23:28;23:29;"stuff about his family,"
23:29;23:30;"not that different than things"
23:30;23:31;"you've probably heard in his stump speech."
23:31;23:31;"Yeah."
23:31;23:33;"My parents were working people."
23:33;23:35;"And my father's family was wiped out in the Holocaust."
23:35;23:37;"Cause I heard about a guy called Hitler."
23:37;23:39;"He keeps it simple and straightforward."
23:39;23:40;"No history on it."
23:40;23:41;"Yeah."
23:41;23:43;"One day my dad took me and he said,"
23:43;23:46;"Bernie, I want to tell you a story."
23:46;23:46;"Yeah."
23:46;23:48;"You can picture the way other candidates would have like"
23:48;23:50;"the story of like your working class father,"
23:50;23:52;"whose family was wiped out in the Holocaust."
23:52;23:53;"And yeah, you'd like be working on it"
23:53;23:55;"with your strategist, just be like,"
23:55;23:57;"so do you remember the first time"
23:57;23:58;"your parent told you that story?"
23:58;23:58;"And they're like, I don't know."
23:58;24:00;"I mean, I grew up, it was part of our family history."
24:00;24:02;"And it's like, okay, but like paint a picture for me."
24:02;24:03;"It's like, let me tell you a story."
24:03;24:05;"When I was a kid in Brooklyn,"
24:05;24:08;"my dad invited me in to his working class place of business."
24:08;24:11;"It was noisy, smelled bad."
24:11;24:13;"And he said, Bernie, I got to tell you something,"
24:13;24:14;"you know, like just really funny."
24:14;24:14;"I've never said it."
24:14;24:16;"So I'm sure somebody could find an example"
24:16;24:17;"of him doing something close to that."
24:17;24:19;"But generally speaking, it's just always like"
24:19;24:20;"my parents were working people."
24:20;24:22;"Father's family was wiped out by Hitler."
24:22;24:23;"I think I know a thing or two, you know, like,"
24:23;24:28;"but anyway, Bernie has no time for like the fun stuff."
24:28;24:31;"So there's not a ton of talk about the type of music he likes."
24:31;24:32;"But I remember in the book,"
24:32;24:35;"there was a significant amount of ink spilled,"
24:35;24:38;"not about specific stuff, but just his pride as mayor"
24:38;24:41;"in terms of like local events and how they had,"
24:41;24:45;"I don't know, like drama festivals and poetry."
24:45;24:46;"I remember this one part where he's like,"
24:46;24:47;"even Allen Ginsberg came up to Burlington"
24:47;24:50;"for a event that the town put on."
24:50;24:51;"So, you know, that fits Bernie."
24:51;24:53;"Like he's definitely not a type of dude"
24:53;24:54;"who'd be like dropping his top 10 list"
24:54;24:57;"at the end of the year."
24:57;24:58;"- Oh my God, that's so funny."
24:58;25:00;"- Now, of course he must've listened to Phish"
25:00;25:02;"just to some extent."
25:02;25:04;"At the very least, he must've heard some performance."
25:04;25:06;"Maybe if he gave a stump speech somewhere."
25:06;25:07;"- I'm sure he's seen them."
25:07;25:08;"- Yeah, I'm sure he's probably seen them."
25:08;25:10;"- Yeah, they're playing like a park"
25:10;25:11;"in Burlington in the summer."
25:11;25:12;"- Yeah, something like that."
25:12;25:15;"But here's the thing, I'm speaking to the Jam Band nation,"
25:15;25:17;"the Jam Band community, jambands.com."
25:17;25:19;"- Jambands.com."
25:19;25:23;"- Relics, if anybody from the Jam Band community"
25:23;25:26;"is still on the fence about Bernie or Mayor Pete,"
25:26;25:28;"which I kind of doubt, but let's say"
25:28;25:30;"if anybody's still on the fence and you're thinking,"
25:30;25:31;"""You know what?"
25:31;25:34;"Bernie and Mayor Pete have both shouted out Phish."
25:34;25:36;"And you know, Pete's a little closer in age to me."
25:36;25:38;"I don't know, and whatever."""
25:38;25:40;"Be like, ""Okay, but Mayor Pete has not said"
25:40;25:42;"a damn word about Twiddle."""
25:42;25:44;"And we know for a fact that Bernie's seen Twiddle"
25:44;25:45;"because--"
25:45;25:46;"- I'd like to thank Twiddle."
25:46;25:47;"- Thank you, Twiddle."
25:47;25:49;"Mayor Pete's never heard of Twiddle."

26:27;26:29;"to see if there were any like weird Trump dudes"
26:30;26:30;"- That sounds familiar"
26:30;26:33;"- And we couldn't tell if there's like trolling or like"
26:33;26:35;"- I mean, there's a, yeah, this sounds like"
26:35;26:36;"- Socialist BS"
26:36;26:36;"- This sounds familiar"
26:36;26:39;"There's a hundred percent gotta be some deadheads"
26:39;26:42;"who are like hardcore capitalist right-wears"
26:42;26:43;"- You know who's in is like Ann Coulter"
26:43;26:45;"- She's a deadhead?"
26:45;26:46;"- She's a deadhead"
26:46;26:46;"- No"
26:46;26:49;"(explosion)"
26:49;26:52;"- Ann Coulter, I'm a Grateful Dead fan for life"
26:52;26:54;"The conservative political author estimates"
26:54;26:56;"she saw the band 67 times"
26:56;26:59;"and still listens to her 50 live tapes"
26:59;27:00;"Loads of deadheads were libertarians"
27:00;27:02;"and not just for the drug laws"
27:02;27:04;"That's when the definition of libertarian"
27:04;27:05;"just gets so out of control"
27:05;27:07;"where it's like, yeah, man, libertarians"
27:07;27:09;"I believe people should have like a lot of freedom"
27:09;27:10;"like tight"
27:10;27:11;"But then you support all this like"
27:11;27:15;"- She's like hardcore anti-immigration, hardcore"
27:15;27:17;"- She explains there was a faction of dead heads"
27:17;27:18;"within her community growing up"
27:18;27:20;"Contrary to some people's image of the dead"
27:20;27:22;"they were huge in my very affluent WASP hometown"
27:22;27:24;"of New Canaan, Connecticut"
27:24;27:28;"- Oh Jesus, another dark stain on CT"
27:29;27:33;"I mean, we gained a little ground"
27:33;27:35;"with the discovery of Goose"
27:35;27:36;"- Yeah"
27:36;27:39;"- Feeling pretty good about the CT vibes"
27:39;27:41;"Did she say my WASP-y community in Connecticut?"
27:41;27:44;"- My very affluent WASP hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut"
27:44;27:46;"- My very affluent"
27:46;27:47;"- She said there was a faction in favor"
27:47;27:49;"of making Truckin' our prom song"
27:49;27:51;"Okay, first of all, it's a little basic"
27:51;27:53;"- Prom?"
27:53;27:56;"What year was this? Wow"
27:56;27:57;"- I guess it must've been like the 70s"
27:57;27:59;"- 80s? This is so rough"
27:59;28:01;"I can never pick a favorite song"
28:01;28:04;"just as I can't pick a favorite Scalia to send"
28:04;28:05;"- Oh my God"
28:05;28:09;"But among the ones I love are Tennessee Jed, Althea, Taste"
28:09;28:10;"- Okay, I mean, they're not Bobby songs"
28:10;28:11;"- Taste"
28:11;28:16;"- They're like classic mid-tempo Jerry numbers"
28:16;28:19;"- Stagger Lee, I mean, that's not bad"
28:19;28:22;"Eyes of the World, Loose Lucy, I mean, all right"
28:22;28:22;"- That's rough"
28:22;28:25;"- You would categorize Loose Lucy as rough stuff"
28:25;28:25;"- That's rough"
28:26;28:27;"- Rough stuff"
28:27;28:30;"- Franklin's Tower, Deal, Sugar Magnolia, Unbroken"
28:30;28:31;"I mean, she's picking classics"
28:31;28:33;"- I mean, yeah, she understands the dead clearly"
28:33;28:37;"But the dead have that component"
28:37;28:39;"- Oh wait, I mostly followed them as a practicing lawyer"
28:39;28:41;"from 1991 to August '95"
28:41;28:43;"I wonder if she was at the last show"
28:43;28:46;"- Wow, time crisis this week"
28:46;28:50;"Ann Coulter calls in to discuss being at the historic"
28:50;28:52;"last show in Chicago"
28:52;28:54;"- Now listen, Ann, we don't see eye to eye on a lot of stuff"
28:54;28:55;"but we're not here to talk politics"
28:55;28:58;"So yeah, so tell us, Tennessee Jets, that's your favorite song"
28:58;28:59;"Do you have a favorite performance?"
28:59;29:01;"What are your top five Tennessee Jets?"
29:01;29:04;"It breaks my heart that the band never played"
29:04;29:05;"Pride of Cucamonga in concert"
29:05;29:08;"That would have been as big a story as Brexit"
29:08;29:10;"and probably would have rocked the stock market just as much"
29:10;29:11;"Oh my God, shut up"
29:11;29:15;"- So she's referencing like obscure Phil songs"
29:15;29:17;"Good for you, Ann"
29:17;29:19;"- By the way, Phil is a Bernie donor"
29:19;29:19;"- Oh, is he?"
29:19;29:20;"- I looked it up, yeah"
29:20;29:21;"- That's tight"
29:21;29:23;"- I had a day the other day where I was just like"
29:23;29:25;"you can look up people's donations"
29:25;29:26;"- How do you do that?"
29:26;29:28;"- You can look it up in the SEC"
29:28;29:29;"It's pretty wild actually"
29:29;29:32;"And I do want to caution people if you get into this"
29:32;29:35;"before you go through it judging people too harshly"
29:35;29:37;"'cause you're like, oh, they didn't donate to the person I like"
29:37;29:40;"I looked at my own and it's missing a bunch of stuff"
29:40;29:42;"Actually, I looked you up, Jake"
29:42;29:42;"- Yeah?"
29:42;29:43;"- Strong choices"
29:43;29:44;"- Did, really?"
29:44;29:45;"- Actually, I should look this up right now"
29:45;29:49;"- You know, speaking of Mayor Pete, I gave money to him early on"
29:49;29:50;"- Oh, really?"
29:50;29:51;"- Like when he first emerged"
29:53;29:57;"I don't know, I guess it was early 2019"
29:57;29:57;"- Yeah"
29:57;29:59;"- And he was just like, yeah, I want to like stack the court"
29:59;30:01;"I want to like try to like get rid of the electoral college"
30:01;30:02;"I was like, this is cool"
30:02;30:03;"Like who's this young dude?"
30:03;30:03;"- Yeah"
30:03;30:06;"- And I remember watching this like CNN town hall with him"
30:06;30:08;"and he was talking about like his relationship to religion"
30:08;30:08;"- Yeah"
30:08;30:11;"- And like being from Indiana and his relationship with Mike Pence"
30:11;30:12;"And I was like, this is a cool dude"
30:12;30:13;"- Yeah"
30:13;30:14;"- So I kicked him some dough for like, you know"
30:14;30:16;"I did like a monthly thing for a while"
30:16;30:16;"- Yeah"
30:16;30:19;"- And then at some point I switched over to Bernie"
30:19;30:19;"- Back to Bernie"
30:19;30:20;"- Back to Bernie"
30:20;30:22;"- I think a lot of people are back to Bernie"
30:22;30:22;"- Yeah"
30:22;30:23;"- It's been a journey, but"
30:23;30:25;"- Wait, so look me up"
30:25;30:26;"- So the funny thing is about this"
30:26;30:28;"'cause I looked up my own"
30:28;30:32;"and it had three donations I made to Bernie in 2016"
30:32;30:36;"and it was missing like all of my donations in this election"
30:36;30:38;"- Is this through ActBlue that you're doing that?"
30:38;30:40;"- Yes, that might be part of it"
30:40;30:41;"It's 'cause it's through ActBlue"
30:41;30:41;"- Right"
30:41;30:44;"- Jake Longstreth, you went big in 2016"
30:44;30:48;"You gave him a $1,600 donation"
30:48;30:49;"- You know what that was?"
30:49;30:49;"- What?"
30:49;30:51;"- A Richard Pictures fundraiser at El Cid"
30:51;30:53;"- Ah, wow"
30:53;30:54;"- Yep"
30:54;30:57;"- Adds up, but you also made some other ones at 250 and"
30:57;30:59;"oh, 250 in this election cycle"
30:59;31:00;"So yeah, you're putting your money where your mouth is, man"
31:00;31:01;"- I'm in"
31:01;31:04;"- Jake Longstreth, occupation artist"
31:04;31:06;"- That's so funny that that's there"
31:06;31:06;"- I know, it's weird"
31:06;31:08;"But so I was like kind of like going wild on this"
31:08;31:10;"'cause I was just like, whoa, who can you look up?"
31:10;31:12;"So I was like, The Lush"
31:12;31:14;"I looked up Jerry Garcia, nothing came up"
31:14;31:16;"'cause sometimes it goes back to like the 80s"
31:16;31:18;"- Wow, Jerry Garcia, Richard Nixon"
31:18;31:20;"(laughing)"
31:20;31:21;"- What?"
31:21;31:21;"- Man"
31:21;31:22;"- Man"
31:22;31:24;"- You know, I liked what he was doing with China"
31:24;31:26;"I mean, he's opening that place up"
31:26;31:28;"Needed to have him, he formed the EPA"
31:28;31:30;"He's not so bad a guy"
31:30;31:31;"- He's a California boy, man"
31:31;31:32;"What can I say?"
31:32;31:34;"- Working class California guy, just like me"
31:34;31:38;"- So, with Phil, yeah, he gave money to Barbara Boxer"
31:38;31:42;"Betty Sue Sutton, MoveOn.org"
31:42;31:45;"Gave John Kerry in 2004"
31:45;31:48;"On the one hand, I'm like, this stuff needs to be out there"
31:48;31:49;"- What's the max you can give?"
31:49;31:51;"- In one campaign, one election cycle"
31:51;31:54;"The max you can give to an individual candidate is $2,800"
31:54;31:57;"- $2,800, okay, that's so funny"
31:57;31:58;"- But I think also the thing is like"
31:58;32:00;"- Like why they limit the individual?"
32:00;32:02;"It's like, 'cause there's all these workarounds"
32:02;32:04;"with all those packs and (beep)"
32:04;32:05;"- Well, yeah, I think"
32:05;32:06;"- It's so stupid"
32:06;32:07;"- They should limit all of it"
32:07;32:07;"- Yeah"
32:07;32:09;"- I think there's a lot of candidates too"
32:09;32:11;"because like you get those, as we've talked about"
32:11;32:13;"you incessantly get those emails"
32:13;32:15;"and so I think there's so many candidates"
32:15;32:17;"who are like, I've gave, you know, I'm like, all right"
32:17;32:18;"What's up with this person?"
32:18;32:20;"Like here's 50 and then you get like another email"
32:20;32:22;"It's like, for the love of God"
32:22;32:26;"If each one of you gave me $14 right now, I could live to"
32:26;32:28;"So I feel like I've given a lot of small donations"
32:28;32:30;"That's not going to show up on something like this"
32:30;32:31;"Is there somebody you can think of?"
32:31;32:34;"- I'm trying to think of someone more interesting"
32:34;32:35;"than just like movie stars"
32:35;32:37;"- Right, wait, should we try Bob Weir?"
32:37;32:38;"- Yeah"
32:38;32:42;"- Let's see, Robert Weir, San Rafael, California"
32:42;32:44;"Occupation Grateful Dead"
32:44;32:44;"- That's so tight"
32:44;32:46;"- This is amazing"
32:46;32:48;"Date 5/15/92"
32:48;32:52;"$1,000 to Harold K Lonsdale, Independent"
32:52;32:53;"- Interesting, maybe local election?"
32:53;32:54;"- Not familiar"
32:54;32:57;"Then in 2004, he gave 250 to John Kerry"
32:57;33:00;"2008, gave some money to Barack Obama"
33:00;33:03;"Gave some money to Dan Hamburg"
33:03;33:05;"You know, he's given a lot of money to the DNC"
33:05;33:09;"- Just generally to the DNC"
33:09;33:10;"Who's got like a really unique name?"
33:10;33:12;"- Cardi B"
33:12;33:14;"Wait, what's Cardi B's real name?"
33:14;33:14;"It is very unique"
33:15;33:17;"It's Bel Callis"
33:17;33:21;"Again, I'm not going to take any of this as gospel"
33:21;33:24;"And I know this probably seems a little bit like dicey"
33:24;33:25;"I'm very pro-privacy"
33:25;33:28;"But I do think with politics, it's like, come on"
33:28;33:29;"Money and politics"
33:29;33:31;"That there's a reason it needs to be open"
33:31;33:33;"- Robert Zimmerman"
33:33;33:35;"- Oh, there's going to be so many people named"
33:35;33:36;"- You think so?"
33:36;33:36;"- Yeah"
33:36;33:39;"- Is Zimmerman like a really common name?"
33:39;33:39;"- Yeah"
33:39;33:40;"- Huh"
33:40;33:42;"- All right, we can think of somebody good"
33:42;33:44;"I want to search Steve Miller, but it's going to be impossible to"
33:45;33:46;"- Oh, yeah"
33:46;33:47;"- You know, one thing I'll say about this"
33:47;33:49;"Because, you know, to reiterate"
33:49;33:51;"There's very few times I take pleasure in just like"
33:51;33:53;"Finding information about people"
33:53;33:55;"There's something very hackery about it"
33:55;33:57;"You know, I think people deserve their privacy"
33:57;34:00;"But I will say that more people should know that this stuff is public"
34:00;34:04;"Because it kind of encourages, I think, celebrities"
34:04;34:06;"And look, I think when a lot of celebrities"
34:06;34:09;"People get, especially out here in Hollywood"
34:09;34:11;"People get invited to like dinners"
34:11;34:13;"And somebody's like, yo, we got this like great person"
34:13;34:14;"Who's running for Senate"
34:14;34:15;"And you go and you hear them talk"
34:15;34:17;"And you're just like, you probably haven't like"
34:17;34:18;"Read every little thing about them"
34:18;34:20;"You met them in person or something"
34:20;34:21;"And then you're just kind of like, all right, yeah"
34:21;34:23;"I'll max out for your campaign"
34:23;34:25;"Or you just know that they're the Democrat"
34:25;34:28;"Obviously, people look at senatorial races"
34:28;34:30;"And presidential races pretty differently"
34:30;34:30;"- Yeah"
34:30;34:32;"- Like our friend Beto"
34:32;34:34;"I was throwing money at the Senate race"
34:34;34:35;"Not the presidential race"
34:35;34:38;"But I do think if more rich people and celebrities"
34:38;34:41;"And, you know, even people who aren't rich or celebrities"
34:41;34:43;"Just people who just at least have enough money"
34:43;34:44;"That they can give at this amount"
34:44;34:46;"Which of course not everybody can"
34:46;34:49;"But if you think of it as being like this a lifetime record"
34:49;34:51;"You'd be like, you know what?"
34:51;34:53;"Yeah, don't be stingy"
34:53;34:56;"Like because maybe in 15 years, you know"
34:56;34:57;"Some guys on internet radio"
34:57;35:00;"Shall be looking back at your past 30 years of contribution"
35:00;35:02;"And what kind of names are we going to see there?"
35:02;35:03;"What kind of giving?"
35:03;35:05;"And obviously people give money to charities"
35:05;35:07;"I can understand why people are somewhat alienated"
35:07;35:08;"By electoral politics"
35:08;35:09;"- Yeah"
35:09;35:11;"- But I just, you know, I feel like"
35:11;35:12;"Even though he didn't come up"
35:12;35:14;"Wouldn't it be tight if you're just like"
35:14;35:16;"Jerry Garcia, like Ralph Nate"
35:16;35:19;"Just like all like the tight people"
35:19;35:20;"- Jerry Brown"
35:20;35:22;"- Imagine if it was like Jerry Garcia"
35:22;35:23;"And it was just like"
35:23;35:26;"Bernie Sanders mayoral campaign 1980"
35:26;35:28;"- Jerry was tapped in"
35:28;35:29;"- $72"
35:29;35:33;"That was a lot of money back then, man"
35:33;35:36;"- Handwritten check mailing that across the country"
35:36;35:36;"- Yeah"
35:36;35:38;"Okay, hold on"
35:38;35:40;"Just before we give up on this"
35:40;35:42;"Wait, I feel like"
35:42;35:44;"- That's a fun game"
35:44;35:45;"- It is a fun game"
35:45;35:46;"I think one that I like"
35:46;35:46;"- Great radio"
35:46;35:48;"- Just like Quentin Tarantino"
35:48;35:49;"- Oh, that's a tight call"
35:49;35:50;"No one"
35:50;35:52;"- No, he gave in 2011"
35:52;35:55;"He gave $2,500 to Barack Obama"
35:55;35:59;"And in 2011, he also gave $30,000 to the DNC"
35:59;35:59;"- Wow"
35:59;36:01;"- Look at you, Quentin"
36:01;36:02;"- Stepping it up"
36:02;36:05;"But not in 2016, interesting"
36:05;36:06;"- Well, see, that's where"
36:06;36:06;"- This is so interesting"
36:06;36:08;"- No, no, no, but that's where I don't feel like"
36:08;36:09;"Confident enough in the information"
36:09;36:09;"- Right"
36:09;36:10;"- To be like, ""Quentin, what?"""
36:10;36:11;"'Cause I'm just like"
36:11;36:15;"- But I had my Bernie donations from 2016"
36:15;36:16;"- Let me look mine up again"
36:16;36:18;"It must be this act blue thing, but I was just like"
36:18;36:20;"- But I think I did the Bernie thing through"
36:20;36:23;"- None of my 2019 contributions come up on this one"
36:23;36:26;"I'm not confident enough to say that"
36:26;36:26;"- Sure"
36:26;36:27;"- Omissions"
36:27;36:28;"- Yeah, yeah"
36:28;36:29;"- Mean that somebody like straight up fell off"
36:29;36:31;"Like that just seems like such like a classic"
36:31;36:33;"Like clickbait trash article"
36:33;36:34;"That you could just imagine on like some like"
36:34;36:35;"- Oh my God"
36:35;36:37;"- Where somebody's like reading through the"
36:37;36:39;"The, you know, celebrities giving history"
36:39;36:42;"And it's like, ""Quentin Tarantino felt a little generous in 2011"
36:42;36:45;"But in the nine years since, absolutely nothing"""
36:45;36:46;"- And just like, they're just literally just looking at"
36:46;36:48;"The same website that we're looking at"
36:48;36:50;"- Not doing any further research"
36:50;36:52;"- I guess when he was working on"
36:52;36:53;"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
36:53;36:56;"Quinn got a little disengaged from modern politics"
36:56;36:57;"Like yeah, for all we know"
36:57;36:59;"He's like splashing it out, who knows"
36:59;36:59;"- Yeah"
37:00;37:01;"Red and white"
37:01;37:04;"Blue suede shoes"
37:04;37:08;"I'm Uncle Sam"
37:08;37:10;"How do you do?"
37:10;37:14;"Give me five"
37:14;37:17;"I'm still alive"
37:17;37:21;"Ain't no luck"
37:21;37:24;"I learned to duck"
37:24;37:26;"Check my pulse"
37:26;37:29;"It don't change"
37:29;37:32;"Stay 72"
37:32;37:35;"Come shine or rain"
37:35;37:39;"Wave the flag"
37:39;37:42;"Pop the bag"
37:42;37:45;"Park the boat"
37:45;37:48;"Skin the goat"
37:48;37:51;"I'm still alive"
37:52;37:53;"Skin the goat"
37:53;38:00;"- You're listening to"
38:00;38:03;"Time Crisis"
38:03;38:04;"On Beat One"
38:04;38:07;"- So, on a fairly recent episode"
38:07;38:09;"We were talking about Jet a bunch"
38:09;38:10;"And by the way, Jake, you got a little hot water"
38:10;38:12;"I think we got an email from somebody who implied"
38:12;38:15;"An Australian who thought that you dissed AC/DC"
38:15;38:16;"- I did"
38:16;38:17;"- Oh, you did?"
38:17;38:17;"- Yeah, I'm not a fan"
38:17;38:19;"- I thought that was taken out of context"
38:19;38:20;"You gotta respect them"
38:20;38:20;"- Well, sure"
38:21;38:22;"Did I diss them?"
38:22;38:23;"I don't know"
38:23;38:26;"I just was like, ""This sounds like AC/DC"""
38:26;38:28;"I don't like, you know, I just, I don't like AC/DC"
38:28;38:30;"- You just straight up don't like AC/DC"
38:30;38:34;"- I like, shook me all night long"
38:34;38:35;"- That's a great song"
38:35;38:36;"- And that's it"
38:36;38:38;"- You don't like Back in Black?"
38:38;38:38;"- No"
38:38;38:40;"I don't know what, I just, like, they don't do it for me, man"
38:40;38:43;"- Anyway, so we were talking about Jet"
38:43;38:46;"And I was really sticking up for Jet"
38:46;38:47;"I think we both were a little bit"
38:47;38:48;"- Sure"
38:48;38:49;"- I can't remember if we fantasized this"
38:49;38:53;"Or if this was real that the dude from Tame Impala"
38:53;38:55;"He was doing an interview"
38:55;38:56;"And somebody was kind of saying how"
38:56;38:57;"""You're a very cool Australian band"""
38:57;38:58;"As opposed to Jet"
38:58;39:01;"And he actually, like, put the journalist in their place"
39:01;39:02;"- This is full TC fantasy"
39:02;39:07;"- Anyway, but we referenced on that episode"
39:07;39:08;"An infamous Pitchfork review"
39:08;39:11;"Which I believe was a score of 0.0"
39:11;39:14;"Awarded to Jet for their second album"
39:14;39:16;"And they just put a gif of a monkey in its mouth"
39:16;39:20;"One of the ultimate most disrespectful reviews of all time"
39:20;39:20;"- It's raw"
39:20;39:22;"- And I remember at the time I was speculating"
39:22;39:25;"I was like, ""Well, that's so over the top"
39:25;39:27;"""That maybe it's better than just, like,"
39:27;39:30;"""A 2000 word evisceration of why Jet is bad for humanity"""
39:30;39:31;"That was like, maybe the Jet guys laughed it off"
39:31;39:33;"And then we actually found some of those, like,"
39:33;39:34;"Jet guys were not pleased"
39:34;39:35;"Really hurt their feelings"
39:35;39:38;"And anyway, so then we get an email out of nowhere"
39:38;39:40;"From a guy named Chris Kasky"
39:40;39:41;"And he said, ""What's up? My name's Chris"""
39:41;39:42;"And blah blah"
39:42;39:43;"""Huge fan of what you guys do"""
39:43;39:44;"He's been listening to TC"
39:44;39:47;"And then he says, ""I ran Pitchfork"
39:47;39:49;"""And founded Program There Festivals on top of that"
39:49;39:50;"""For like 14 years"""
39:50;39:52;"And he goes on to say"
39:52;39:55;"That there's so many things that he hears on TC"
39:55;39:57;"That kind of intersect with things in his own life"
39:57;40:02;"The fact that he booked Vampire and Bon Iver at an event"
40:02;40:05;"The fact that he actually wrote the Jet Monkey review"
40:05;40:08;"Among other cruel reviews"
40:08;40:09;"And then also that he's a deadhead"
40:09;40:11;"So he's not at Pitchfork anymore"
40:11;40:13;"But he wrote us this nice email"
40:13;40:15;"And basically said, like,"
40:15;40:17;"""You guys just keep bringing stuff up"
40:17;40:19;"""That I was actually in the middle of"
40:19;40:21;"""Or specifically responsible for"
40:21;40:22;"""Which has left me in a really weird headspace"
40:22;40:24;"""And just wanted to share it with y'all"""
40:24;40:24;"I can understand that"
40:24;40:25;"You're TC-head"
40:25;40:26;"You're just kind of cruising through"
40:26;40:28;"And then you start hearing, like,"
40:28;40:29;"Little snippets from your own life"
40:29;40:29;"Yeah"
40:29;40:31;"And he said, ""If you guys ever want to go deep"
40:31;40:34;"""On the P-Fork, the dead/indie worlds"
40:34;40:37;"""From 2003 to 2017, here for it"""
40:37;40:39;"He also said he was talking to Stephen Hyden"
40:39;40:40;"About Goose and stuff"
40:40;40:41;"So, yeah, it's..."
40:41;40:44;"I mean, this guy's clearly part of the TCU"
40:44;40:44;"So we thought, why not?"
40:44;40:45;"Let's get him on the phone"
40:45;40:46;"Great"
40:46;40:47;"Let's chop it up"
40:47;40:47;"Great"
40:47;40:49;"Let's get on with Chris Kasky"
40:49;40:53;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
40:53;40:57;"Hello"
40:57;40:58;"Chris, what's up?"
40:58;40:59;"Hey, what's going on?"
40:59;41:00;"Welcome to Time Crisis"
41:00;41:01;"You're on with me and Jake"
41:01;41:02;"Hey, excited to be here"
41:02;41:05;"We also got the fellas from Jet in the room"
41:05;41:08;"As well as Kevin Parker"
41:08;41:10;"Who's kind of taking a break from Tame Impala"
41:10;41:10;"To manage them"
41:11;41:13;"No, but we really appreciate your email"
41:13;41:15;"And it's pretty wild that we seem to have"
41:15;41:17;"So much in common"
41:17;41:19;"Yeah, it's been pretty surreal"
41:19;41:20;"Over the last kind of..."
41:20;41:22;"Probably six months, maybe"
41:22;41:24;"Just listening and enjoying the show"
41:24;41:26;"And enjoying everything you guys are covering"
41:26;41:28;"Just bottom line being a fan of it"
41:28;41:30;"But also just like reliving a life"
41:30;41:33;"That in some ways, over the last couple of years"
41:33;41:34;"I've kind of been like"
41:34;41:36;"Just purposefully not thinking about"
41:36;41:38;"And then also just the amount of things that you're covering"
41:38;41:40;"And the amount of things that are happening at the same time"
41:40;41:42;"Or even just perspectives happening at the same time"
41:42;41:42;"It's really fun"
41:42;41:43;"So I was like, you know what?"
41:43;41:44;"Don't really know what to do"
41:44;41:46;"But saying something and just reaching out"
41:46;41:47;"And saying you appreciate something"
41:47;41:48;"Has always been something I try to do"
41:48;41:50;"So I wanted to do that"
41:50;41:51;"So it's fun to work out"
41:51;41:53;"We really appreciated it"
41:53;41:55;"Okay, so you're saying the life that you're talking about"
41:55;41:58;"Of being a part of Pitchfork, writing reviews and all that stuff"
41:58;41:59;"That's over"
41:59;42:00;"It's over, yeah"
42:00;42:02;"So this is a bit of an Irishman right now"
42:02;42:04;"You're an infamous hitman"
42:04;42:08;"You're an infamous hitman who left a life"
42:08;42:10;"I mean, I imagine you're still a fairly young guy"
42:10;42:12;"But you're sitting in a metaphorical nursing home"
42:12;42:14;"No longer living the life"
42:14;42:16;"I'm definitely living a life"
42:16;42:18;"You're living a life, but a different life"
42:18;42:21;"And then me and Jake are just some intrepid journalists"
42:21;42:22;"Just coming in to find you and be like"
42:22;42:23;"Hey man, is it true?"
42:23;42:25;"I don't know, I don't know"
42:25;42:27;"That's where the metaphor ends"
42:27;42:28;"Maybe just like walk us through it"
42:28;42:29;"Like what's your history?"
42:29;42:32;"So I started at Pitchfork in like 2003 and 2004"
42:32;42:36;"So Ryan had had the site going for like a good six or so years"
42:36;42:38;"And it was definitely, you know, it had a stable of critics"
42:38;42:42;"It had a loyal following, albeit, you know, somewhat small at the time"
42:42;42:44;"And I was like 22"
42:44;42:47;"So I met Ryan and effectively kind of came on to take over"
42:47;42:50;"Like all of the business of everything that was happening there"
42:50;42:53;"To try to enable the growth of what Pitchfork was"
42:53;42:55;"And so like I'm not an actual writer"
42:55;42:57;"Like I ran everything else at Pitchfork"
42:57;43:00;"I ran the kind of creative and the brand and the business"
43:00;43:03;"And I programmed and booked the music festivals and founded those"
43:03;43:05;"But, you know, Ryan founded the site"
43:05;43:09;"And then we kind of, we've always viewed around 2000, 2004"
43:09;43:12;"As kind of like the V2, if you will, of what happened next"
43:12;43:14;"In terms of just formalizing a lot of things"
43:14;43:16;"And just trying to get people paid"
43:16;43:18;"And trying to get the site working"
43:18;43:22;"And then obviously from there, it was kind of a large part of my professional life"
43:22;43:24;"For the last kind of 15 or so years"
43:24;43:27;"So you got out during the Condé Nast sale?"
43:27;43:29;"No, no, so Ryan and I were the only owners of the site"
43:29;43:31;"And so when we sold, we stuck around for a while"
43:31;43:34;"And I left first and then Ryan left second"
43:34;43:37;"Yeah, I was there for like almost 15 years after that"
43:37;43:39;"Wow, okay, so that, yeah"
43:39;43:40;"Long time"
43:40;43:43;"So you didn't put your name on the Jet review?"
43:43;43:45;"No, it was attributed to a writer named Ray Suzuki"
43:45;43:49;"Who does not exist but was a popular byline for kind of reviews"
43:49;43:52;"That at the time didn't have a writer behind them"
43:52;43:56;"Or didn't necessarily feel like it was appropriate to even put a writer on them"
43:56;43:58;"Okay, so paint a picture for me"
43:58;44:00;"Do you remember what year the Jet review was?"
44:00;44:04;"Jet was in 2000 and I think it was 2006"
44:04;44:08;"So I've been there a few years and we had over like probably a year or two"
44:08;44:10;"We'd see like, you know, the site had been growing"
44:10;44:12;"And what we had been doing had been growing"
44:12;44:15;"But it was still, you know, it's akin to a lot of things"
44:15;44:18;"Whether it's like a band or it's, you know, any company, whatever"
44:18;44:20;"You do a lot of things, you kind of just learn and grow"
44:20;44:25;"And so we were working in what is effectively like a private detective's office"
44:25;44:27;"In the Logan Square neighborhood in Chicago"
44:27;44:29;"And there was a restaurant we worked at every day called Lula Cafe"
44:29;44:30;"Which is beneath us"
44:30;44:33;"And we were all sitting around and there was a review"
44:33;44:35;"I don't know if you guys remember the website Tiny Mixtapes?"
44:35;44:36;"Sure, yeah"
44:36;44:37;"So Tiny Mixtapes is great"
44:37;44:40;"And they had a review I think a year prior maybe or around there"
44:40;44:41;"That I was obsessed with personally"
44:41;44:44;"Just because as someone that influenced editorial strategy"
44:44;44:47;"And thinking about how like basically to protect criticism"
44:47;44:50;"And to like try to continue that forward"
44:50;44:52;"And to develop a world in which that actually is at the forefront"
44:52;44:56;"They had been obsessed over just the notion of what they did with this Nine Inch Nails review"
44:56;44:58;"Which was, they didn't give it a review"
44:58;45:04;"They wrote it basically like a screenshot of them throwing it into the garbage can on their computer"
45:04;45:06;"Which just at the time was like, oh my god, this is just great"
45:06;45:08;"It's like the irreverence and all that"
45:08;45:11;"And at the time criticism was in the internet even"
45:11;45:15;"Were somewhat kind of uncharted territory in terms of how the New Guard had taken over"
45:15;45:18;"We were definitely like punks on the internet"
45:18;45:21;"While all the traditional critics in traditional print publications"
45:21;45:23;"Were kind of like, these guys don't do anything"
45:23;45:25;"They're just clowns, like anything's available"
45:25;45:26;"And we really wanted to legitimize ourselves"
45:26;45:30;"But at the same time have fun and utilize the medium that was kind of available to us"
45:30;45:32;"Thinking about that Tiny Mixtape review"
45:32;45:34;"And thinking about just like deleting a Nine Inch Nails record"
45:34;45:36;"Which is cruel"
45:36;45:38;"But at the same time like it was hilarious"
45:38;45:41;"For 24 year olds and 26 year olds or whatever we all were"
45:41;45:43;"And also not really necessarily understanding"
45:43;45:46;"The way in which the internet was growing and the audience was growing"
45:46;45:48;"Just like, you know what, this review it had already gotten"
45:48;45:52;"The first review had already been given this kind of like very long form"
45:52;45:55;"The writer had just kind of written this like very great piece of prose"
45:55;45:57;"And just really messed around with it and gave it a terrible review"
45:57;45:59;"So it's kind of like, how do you do that again?"
45:59;46:00;"You know, that was kind of where it spawned"
46:00;46:02;"And we were just sitting at lunch, it's like, you know what?"
46:02;46:03;"I was like, hey guys, I got the review for you"
46:03;46:08;"Let's just have it be this video I saw earlier of a monkey f***ing in his own mouth"
46:08;46:10;"And everyone laughed and we thought it was funny"
46:10;46:11;"And then like, you know, the next day you can put it on the internet"
46:11;46:16;"It is really interesting to think that you as somebody who wasn't like a full-time critic"
46:16;46:19;"That you were somebody who was thinking about"
46:19;46:23;"What does this form look like in this totally new world?"
46:23;46:25;"I don't know if philosophically is like too highfalutin"
46:25;46:28;"But you were thinking this big picture way about"
46:28;46:31;"What moves do we make that feel fresh"
46:31;46:34;"And that actually pushes this form into the 21st century"
46:34;46:38;"Which is also interesting now because you see so many people talking about like"
46:38;46:42;"That criticism, professional criticism is kind of over"
46:42;46:46;"Because of the democratization of like writing about music on the internet"
46:46;46:49;"And how easy it is to listen to stuff and all that"
46:49;46:51;"So anyway, I think it's correct to point this out"
46:51;46:54;"As like an important moment in music journalism"
46:54;47:00;"At the time in 2006, did it still kind of feel like basically just like a blog?"
47:00;47:05;"Kind of, yes, I think we'd had like a very interesting couple of years"
47:05;47:08;"You know, there was like everything from a big Arcade Fire review"
47:08;47:10;"To like a Travis Stan review"
47:10;47:13;"And ultimately we'd also done like our first festival in 2005"
47:13;47:17;"So we were seeing the kind of combination of the internet"
47:17;47:19;"And then like physical, tangible, whatever you want to call it culture"
47:20;47:21;"And how that was aligning"
47:21;47:24;"And then obviously it was like pre-omnipresence of streaming media"
47:24;47:26;"So everyone was just like downloads and leaks and all that"
47:26;47:29;"And so, you know, when we started it was like"
47:29;47:32;"Let's create, let's like make a music magazine on the internet"
47:32;47:33;"That's always what Ryan wanted to do"
47:33;47:35;"But I would say that up until like 2003 and 2004"
47:35;47:37;"I think you'd probably be equated to a blog"
47:37;47:40;"I think what we were thinking about ourselves then was probably more ambitious"
47:40;47:42;"But at the same time, it was, you know, uncharted territory"
47:42;47:46;"With regards to how the audience would suddenly react to that, you know"
47:46;47:47;"We relished having an opinion"
47:47;47:49;"We relished having people that were paying attention"
47:49;47:50;"Which was amazing"
47:50;47:52;"The fact that you could like put on a music festival"
47:52;47:54;"Again, celebrating the music"
47:54;47:56;"We weren't starting that thing to like make a business"
47:56;47:59;"So like doing all that felt like you were doing something"
47:59;48:02;"And you know, again, this is where like the dead analog start to flow in"
48:02;48:04;"But it's like creating things that feel good"
48:04;48:06;"And that are bringing in community"
48:06;48:07;"And that are being done in a way that's non-traditional"
48:07;48:11;"And we also like love the fact that"
48:11;48:13;"This is where it kind of is equates to a blog or however"
48:13;48:17;"But the structure, we weren't required to like submit, listen to advances"
48:17;48:20;"And then give it six weeks until the print edition comes out"
48:20;48:23;"We could literally just like listen to things, be instinctual"
48:23;48:25;"Be, you know, proactive and just say like, you know what?"
48:25;48:27;"This is great, let's say something about it"
48:27;48:28;"Or let's begin to cover it"
48:28;48:29;"In those days, it was 100%"
48:29;48:32;"Like there was not a lot of like pre-thought in that"
48:32;48:34;"Just let's go because this is fun"
48:34;48:37;"And so when you guys are talking about it, this record in particular"
48:37;48:40;"Everybody, and I'm gonna be like devil's advocate here a little bit"
48:40;48:42;"Which is often what I do on the show"
48:42;48:43;"No, it's all good"
48:43;48:46;"Had everybody listened to the whole Jet record"
48:46;48:48;"And really spent time with it and engaged with it"
48:48;48:51;"Or, and I totally could understand this perspective"
48:51;48:55;"Or for you guys being in Chicago and being 2006 Pitchfork"
48:55;49:00;"Jet was just so outside of the realm of what you thought was cool"
49:00;49:03;"That it was like you felt no obligation to like"
49:03;49:06;"Engage the way you would have with like an Arcade Fire record at the time"
49:06;49:08;"Like I'm curious about that angle"
49:08;49:10;"Totally, and I, there's a few things in there"
49:10;49:12;"I mean, obviously first and foremost, like again"
49:12;49:13;"I don't want to sound defensive"
49:13;49:14;"Because it's absolutely not defensiveness"
49:14;49:17;"More than like the beauty that we felt at Pitchfork for a long time"
49:17;49:19;"And I can't speak to what they're doing now"
49:19;49:20;"But it's, I imagine no different"
49:20;49:22;"Is that like cool wasn't ever like what would the"
49:22;49:24;"That wasn't ever the metric"
49:24;49:25;"Even though it definitely felt like that"
49:25;49:28;"I think that's where the idea of like opinions and all that"
49:28;49:29;"Conflates with the idea of cool"
49:29;49:31;"Where again, I could be also delusional"
49:31;49:33;"And completely like just not willing to look myself in the mirror"
49:33;49:34;"And admit something"
49:34;49:36;"But you know, looking at something like Jet"
49:36;49:38;"It was like, yeah, in Chicago"
49:38;49:40;"You're kind of removed from the music industry"
49:40;49:43;"You're looking at these things as about as objectively as you can"
49:43;49:46;"And having already heard and given the time to the first record"
49:46;49:47;"Like the second record, yeah, you listen to it"
49:47;49:50;"And you're just like, compared to the things that were coming out in 2006"
49:50;49:53;"I mean, there were so many good bands coming out"
49:53;49:54;"In between 2006, 2010"
49:54;49:57;"Again, just you're seeing all this kind of reminiscing now"
49:57;49:59;"Given what's ever happening with music in general"
49:59;50:03;"And Jet was just like, I mean, you guys nailed it last"
50:03;50:04;"On the show where you talked about it"
50:04;50:05;"It's just like, you're listening to it"
50:05;50:06;"It's like, oh, that's an all right riff or whatever"
50:06;50:09;"But ultimately just like had no place, I don't think"
50:09;50:12;"And it probably didn't have a lot of value at the time"
50:12;50:14;"To like how we were thinking about what music was"
50:14;50:16;"So it wasn't like not worth words"
50:16;50:20;"But it also just wasn't worth more vitriol in the written form"
50:20;50:22;"So instead, it was just like, how can you best describe that?"
50:22;50:25;"And it wasn't the only time, obviously, that that happened moving forward"
50:25;50:29;"But what was the review that you referenced before?"
50:29;50:30;"Oh, yeah, that's the Travis stand"
50:30;50:32;"That's Travis Morrison, yeah"
50:32;50:32;"Okay"
50:32;50:33;"That was what he called this record"
50:33;50:34;"That got a 0.0"
50:34;50:36;"So I guess to be fair"
50:36;50:40;"Because I could imagine that Jet, to some extent"
50:40;50:41;"Like you said, you guys sitting in Chicago"
50:41;50:42;"And I respect that too"
50:42;50:43;"You weren't in like New York or LA"
50:43;50:44;"You weren't in the belly of the beast"
50:44;50:48;"You're in this place that has its own culture and its own like a little"
50:48;50:51;"Obviously, Chicago is literally the third biggest city in America"
50:51;50:53;"It's no stranger to big corporate money or something"
50:53;50:57;"But it's still as far as the media goes, it's not a hot spot"
50:57;51:00;"It's not New York or LA in terms of like maybe how beholden it is"
51:00;51:02;"I don't know the worst way to describe it"
51:02;51:03;"But I guess you can make the case"
51:03;51:06;"And I'm trying to look at this from like the kind vibe point of view"
51:06;51:09;"That yeah, maybe that you guys are thinking of Jet"
51:09;51:13;"Is this band like major label kind of rock band from Australia"
51:13;51:16;"They weren't in dialogue with any of the bands you're championing at the time"
51:16;51:18;"Like they in Arcade Fire at that era"
51:18;51:19;"They were like from different planets"
51:19;51:22;"It's not like they were part of the same community of global rock music"
51:22;51:26;"But Travis Stan, and I got to be honest here"
51:26;51:29;"I'm totally ignorant about Dismemberment Plan or his music"
51:29;51:31;"That's just like I just really don't know that music"
51:31;51:33;"Pitchfork is like a long-standing fan"
51:33;51:34;"Right, so that was"
51:34;51:35;"The Dismemberment Plan, that was a big thing"
51:35;51:38;"You guys probably wouldn't have to think twice about Double Check"
51:38;51:40;"Do we really hate this Jet record?"
51:40;51:41;"You probably didn't have to be like"
51:41;51:44;"Well before we hit send, before we post this sh*t"
51:44;51:45;"We got to think about something"
51:45;51:48;"We see the Jet guys at the Empty Bottle once a week, man"
51:48;51:49;"We were just crushing brews"
51:49;51:49;"Empty Bottle"
51:49;51:53;"We just, you know, yeah, whatever"
51:53;51:54;"And I get, I'm not obviously"
51:54;51:57;"I don't think Travis Morrison lived in Chicago"
51:57;51:57;"But you know what I mean"
51:57;51:59;"That was actually closer to your universe"
51:59;52:01;"It was 100% yeah"
52:01;52:04;"Was that one more of like a take a deep breath and be like"
52:04;52:05;"We're cutting ties"
52:05;52:07;"Well, I mean, I don't think it was thought of that way"
52:07;52:09;"I think that you're definitely like saying"
52:09;52:12;"Hey, this is a stark departure from this person's original band"
52:12;52:16;"And to the point where you effectively score it in a useless fashion"
52:16;52:18;"But I think I would still"
52:18;52:20;"I mean, I haven't read that review in a while"
52:20;52:24;"But I bet it got like 3,000 words written about why it's not good"
52:24;52:29;"And you know, in a way that showcased the respect that the site"
52:29;52:31;"And the writer had for like, you know, whatever"
52:31;52:33;"Six, I can't remember"
52:33;52:35;"I think there's like actually only two or three Dismemberment Plan records"
52:35;52:38;"But you know, a history of music that Dismemberment Plan put out"
52:38;52:41;"That then had this like departure into solo realm"
52:41;52:43;"The band had broken up and it was kind of like"
52:43;52:46;"I have no, I mean, again, like the writers were always kind of independently"
52:46;52:49;"Able to then score the record as they submitted the review to"
52:49;52:52;"So it's not like it was some sort of behind the curtain Oz stuff"
52:52;52:56;"It was obviously like a collaboration between the editors and the writer"
52:56;52:58;"To settle on something if there was any sort of difference"
52:58;53:01;"As we kind of like matured, for lack of a better word"
53:01;53:04;"Like we probably started to find writers that were more akin to way"
53:04;53:07;"In which like the editors or anyone was thinking about the music"
53:07;53:09;"So if like our editor-in-chief at the time was like"
53:09;53:11;"I love the new Readyhead record"
53:11;53:13;"The likelihood of them like giving that to a writer"
53:13;53:15;"That would give it a two or whatever would not happen"
53:15;53:18;"This song is for the orca"
53:18;53:24;"Swimming round in circles at SeaWorld someday"
53:24;53:27;"You'll drown the dude with the clipboard someday"
53:27;53:33;"This song is for the gator"
53:33;53:39;"Laying in the roadside cage in FLA"
53:39;53:42;"You'll tear the cracker to shreds someday"
53:43;53:49;"Well I'll read about you in USA Today"
53:49;53:56;"And it feels so nice that the Lord made this day"
53:56;54:03;"And it feels so right to know that justice"
54:03;54:06;"Will have its say"
54:06;54:09;"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
54:09;54:12;"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
54:12;54:14;"Even as you talk about it, even me"
54:14;54:15;"And you can imagine as a musician"
54:15;54:17;"I got all sorts of complicated feelings"
54:17;54:18;"As a musician"
54:18;54:21;"But also as somebody who just loves chopping it up"
54:21;54:22;"About this type of s*** too"
54:22;54:25;"Just like a music nerd and somebody who hosts a radio show"
54:25;54:29;"I have mixed and complicated feelings about criticism"
54:29;54:30;"And you know, when is it fair"
54:30;54:32;"But that said, as you describe that scene and stuff"
54:32;54:36;"And I'm always like sensitive to how a musician would feel in a circumstance"
54:36;54:38;"But as you describe it, you know, maybe it's an age thing"
54:38;54:40;"But I feel like a nostalgia for that era too"
54:40;54:43;"Even as somebody who would have just maybe been reading Pitchfork"
54:43;54:44;"As I've talked about on the show"
54:44;54:47;"I did have my one attempt to write for Dusted Magazine"
54:47;54:48;"In which I reviewed it"
54:48;54:49;"Oh nice, Dusted's good"
54:49;54:50;"Dirty Projector's record"
54:50;54:52;"Oh very cool"
54:52;54:55;"But I just kind of, I just realized I didn't have it in me"
54:55;54:56;"I was interested in writing"
54:56;54:58;"But I didn't have quite like the right attitude to be like"
54:58;55:00;"If I didn't like something, I just didn't have anything"
55:00;55:01;"I didn't have like an interesting take on it"
55:01;55:04;"That's where like I'm not a critic in a similar way"
55:04;55:07;"Where it's like thinking about music and chopping it up about this stuff"
55:07;55:08;"Is where this all lives"
55:08;55:11;"But for me like putting pen to paper and writing 3,000 words about Jed"
55:11;55:14;"Like that was ultimately why that review was so bad or good"
55:14;55:15;"Is that it's just a YouTube video"
55:15;55:19;"It's like this is the representation of this record, you know, in my opinion"
55:19;55:20;"Which again, for better or worse"
55:20;55:23;"As we're having this conversation, a bunch of things are going through my mind"
55:23;55:25;"A bunch of stuff that I've read recently"
55:25;55:31;"One was kind of the disturbing story of I think the Chicago Reader"
55:31;55:33;"One of the big alt-weeklies in Chicago"
55:33;55:34;"It's the Reader"
55:34;55:35;"I don't know if you saw this"
55:35;55:38;"Somebody wrote this kind of like long thing about the kind of"
55:38;55:40;"You know, just that used to be"
55:40;55:41;"And maybe it is once again"
55:41;55:43;"It had a little bit of an optimistic ending"
55:43;55:46;"But similar to the Village Voice and all over this country"
55:46;55:50;"It was one of many alt-weeklies which existed"
55:50;55:55;"Served their local community and provided a place where a critic"
55:55;55:59;"With a significant readership could just say the opposite thing"
55:59;56:00;"From what everybody else was saying"
56:00;56:02;"They could just be like, you know what?"
56:02;56:04;"That Critic's Choice movie f*cking sucks"
56:04;56:05;"That fan stuff"
56:05;56:09;"This article was about that place getting bought and sold"
56:09;56:12;"And some of the longtime writers and readers, you know"
56:12;56:15;"Feeling mistreated on some like succession sh*t"
56:15;56:17;"Just like big, big equity company coming in"
56:17;56:19;"And you know, then they're talking"
56:19;56:20;"It's been pretty brutal"
56:20;56:20;"Yeah, so it was like"
56:20;56:23;"It was a disturbing story just from the point of view of anybody"
56:23;56:25;"Who appreciates independent media"
56:25;56:26;"But it was also a little bit about just like"
56:26;56:30;"As much as we have a platform"
56:30;56:32;"You could find anybody saying anything at any given time, right?"
56:32;56:34;"Like you could find somebody saying like"
56:34;56:36;"Jet rules, pitchfork sucks"
56:36;56:37;"You can find any opinion at any given time"
56:37;56:40;"So you have more noise and more anger"
56:40;56:41;"And you can find more opinions"
56:41;56:44;"But you actually, that person, that archetype of like"
56:44;56:46;"The alt-weekly writer who truly believes what they're saying"
56:46;56:49;"They're not just trying to get retweets or likes"
56:49;56:50;"Or just stir the pot on Twitter"
56:50;56:52;"That alt-weekly writer who has their column"
56:52;56:53;"Who's just like, yeah, you know"
56:53;56:56;"This week's Hiskel and Ebert were just like"
56:56;56:58;"All about like Schindler's List"
56:58;56:59;"Here's 10, you know, just like going in"
56:59;57:01;"3,000 words about why I think that"
57:01;57:02;"Oh yeah"
57:02;57:03;"I just remember reading this article"
57:03;57:05;"And even not having grown up with a Chicago reader"
57:05;57:07;"And you know, I knew Village Voice a little bit"
57:07;57:09;"Being in the tri-state area"
57:09;57:11;"I was kind of like, it made me nostalgic for something"
57:11;57:13;"That a different media ecosystem"
57:13;57:16;"That I could remember from childhood or something"
57:16;57:17;"And then I also saw something actually"
57:17;57:20;"Uh, Stephen Hyden, who you uh, mentioned"
57:20;57:21;"Oh yeah, totally"
57:21;57:23;"He had an interesting tweet that I saw"
57:23;57:25;"That where he was saying something about"
57:25;57:27;"He was glad that he came up when he did"
57:27;57:29;"Because he was allowed to still be based in the Midwest"
57:29;57:31;"He didn't have to move to New York or LA"
57:31;57:33;"And work for some giant company"
57:33;57:35;"And then I saw some people commenting about like"
57:35;57:37;"Maybe other writers being like"
57:37;57:39;"Yeah, obviously New York and LA have people"
57:39;57:40;"With all different perspectives"
57:40;57:42;"From all around the country, right?"
57:42;57:44;"You know, not everybody's a native New Yorker"
57:44;57:45;"Or native LA person"
57:45;57:48;"But still, when everybody ends up in the same place"
57:48;57:51;"It still somehow, it blunts some type of"
57:51;57:53;"Diversity of opinion about art"
57:53;57:54;"And people were saying"
57:54;57:55;"I even, the thing that really stuck with me"
57:55;57:56;"Somebody made a comment just like"
57:56;57:57;"Yeah, you know, music just sounds different"
57:57;57:58;"Different places"
57:58;58:00;"And I was like, oh, that's kind of deep actually"
58:00;58:01;"When you put it that way"
58:01;58:03;"So anyway, I was thinking about those two things"
58:03;58:05;"And I also just read the Susan Sontag biography"
58:05;58:08;"That talks about like her scene of New York critics"
58:08;58:09;"And they lived and died by criticism"
58:09;58:11;"That was like the highest art form for them"
58:11;58:13;"But then there was also this type of like"
58:13;58:16;"Competitiveness and pettiness between them"
58:16;58:17;"And all this stuff"
58:17;58:19;"So anyway, I guess it's all to say that like"
58:19;58:21;"When I think of the Jet Review"
58:21;58:23;"It might be kind of mean"
58:23;58:24;"But it also, yeah, I don't know"
58:24;58:25;"There's just something about it"
58:25;58:27;"That's like weirdly like charming to me"
58:27;58:28;"As much as I'm somebody who's like"
58:29;58:30;"Always pro-kind vibes"
58:30;58:32;"And you cannot describe that as kind vibes"
58:32;58:33;"Yeah, I mean, I'm with you totally"
58:33;58:35;"I'm not talking about Pitchfork in particular"
58:35;58:37;"But just media in general, right?"
58:37;58:39;"Yeah, like there's something about that energy"
58:39;58:40;"That energy is gone"
58:40;58:42;"And it's like, maybe it exists"
58:42;58:44;"I've been like lamenting it"
58:44;58:46;"Old, like some of like old colleagues at Pitchfork"
58:46;58:48;"Like our role editor in chief, Mark"
58:48;58:49;"He and I were recently talking"
58:49;58:51;"Just like lamenting not the fact that like"
58:51;58:52;"Criticism doesn't exist"
58:52;58:52;"Because it does"
58:52;58:54;"And it's still good"
58:54;58:55;"And almost like by and large"
58:55;58:58;"In the places that invest in criticism"
58:58;58:59;"Are still hiring good writers"
58:59;59:01;"There are still amazing writers coming up"
59:01;59:02;"That like believe in it"
59:02;59:03;"It's just, you alluded to earlier"
59:03;59:05;"Which is this like splintering of ways"
59:05;59:07;"In which it gets to the world"
59:07;59:08;"I think that's where Pitchfork benefited from"
59:08;59:09;"Is that it was kind of like a"
59:09;59:14;"It was a more singular conduit for just context, opinion"
59:14;59:15;"It was a one-way dialogue"
59:15;59:17;"Obviously, there was no like commenting and all that"
59:17;59:18;"But it wasn't"
59:18;59:19;"It was very much like an alt-weekly"
59:19;59:21;"Like the alt-weeklies are some of the people that"
59:21;59:23;"You know, as much as the writers would write for us"
59:23;59:24;"The editors would bemoan us"
59:24;59:25;"Because we'd be on the internet"
59:25;59:26;"Being able to do what we did"
59:26;59:28;"And start to take away win from their sales"
59:28;59:29;"And vice versa, you know"
59:29;59:32;"Like it was very much like a kindred spirit"
59:32;59:33;"And as to an alt-weekly"
59:33;59:35;"And I think that the Reader is a great example"
59:35;59:36;"At least in Chicago, as you kind of recognize"
59:36;59:38;"It's like it, like the Voice"
59:38;59:40;"Like we had writers from the Reader"
59:40;59:41;"We had writers from the Voice"
59:41;59:42;"You go and look at the concert listings for the week"
59:42;59:43;"In the Reader"
59:43;59:45;"And that was what, like that was the Bible"
59:45;59:47;"It wasn't every concert playing in Chicago"
59:47;59:48;"It's just like the ones the Reader thought were good"
59:48;59:51;"And just having that like minor opinion on something"
59:51;59:53;"Through a conduit like that you trusted"
59:53;59:55;"Like the Reader was definitely inspirational"
59:55;59:57;"The same way that all alt-weeklies really were"
59:57;59:58;"And again, at the time was like"
59:58;01:00:00;"There was just less going on"
01:00:00;01:00:04;"So you had an ability to kind of be able to refine the craft"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Be better at your job"
01:00:06;01:00:07;"Have fun with it also"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"And respect the fact that the medium is different"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"Like, you know, there weren't memes"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"There weren't like Twitter"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"I remember like the first, I"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"With one of the first tweets I ever did on Pitchfork's account"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"Was like I thought that"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Sunships were better than Radiohead"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"And that would never go on like Twitter now"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"Wait, that was one of the first"
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Pitchfork Twitter accounts?"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"I think I swear to God"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"I tweeted that from my kitchen"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"And it was like"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"This is 2008 whenever Twitter launched"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"And we had it"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"We're like, oh, we got to get a Twitter thing"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"Which is literally how we probably sounded"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"And then I was in my kitchen"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"I'm like eating sunships"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I'm like, man, these are better than Radiohead"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"Full stop"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"So I put it on Twitter"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"And then you go back and look at like the beginning of time"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"And it's like that's on Pitchfork's Twitter"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"That doesn't seem right"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"But we didn't know what Twitter was, you know"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"Like yeah, if you saw that you'd be like"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Oh, that's like a parody account"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Yeah, totally"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Well, anyway, Chris, I think"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"I'm sure we have more to talk about"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"But I think it's good maybe for this one"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"Just to keep it to Jet and that"
01:00:57;01:00:57;"Oh, totally"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"Early Pitchfork day"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"So hopefully you'll call in again"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Oh, yeah, man"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I just had a thought"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"I think it would be a good thing for the universe"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"If even though I know you're not there anymore"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"But you must still have some connections there"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"If Pitchfork changed their masthead motto"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"From the most trusted voice in music"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"To sunchips are better than Radiohead"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"I just think that's that type of chaotic energy"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"That the music media ecosystem needs"
01:01:22;01:01:22;"I agree"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Just see what you can do"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"You know, even just like for a month"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yeah, I'm doubtful"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"But well, yeah, thanks a lot, Chris"
01:01:31;01:01:32;"We'll talk to you again in the future"
01:01:32;01:01:32;"Have a good one"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Yeah, be well"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Peace"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"This is a pretty guest heavy episode"
01:02:35;01:02:36;"But I think we got some interesting guests this time"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"One, this was a recommendation for Seinfeld"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Shout out to Seinfeld"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Get home soon"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"He said that he was reading about the person"
01:02:43;01:02:47;"Who essentially put Wendy's social media on the map"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"Her name is Amy Brown"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"And she was the social media specialist at Wendy's"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Starting in 2012"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"So it's probably fair to say that she kind of created"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"The modern corporate Twitter account"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"That we spend so much time talking about"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"So she's out there telling her story"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"I guess already two years ago"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"She wrote an article for Splinter.com"
01:03:05;01:03:09;"Called ""The Time I Went Viral While Running the Wendy's Twitter Account"""
01:03:09;01:03:10;"But before we talk, I just want to say one thing"
01:03:10;01:03:13;"Just not to go too politics heavy again, man"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"But the democratic debates were this past week"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"We don't need to talk about all the wild things"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"That happen on stage"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"What was more interesting was what was happening off stage"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"What was happening on the internet"
01:03:25;01:03:29;"And Mike Bloomberg, who was not in the debate"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"He had his social media team just going buck wild"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Just kind of putting him on the map"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"And then they weren't tweeting from his personal account"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"They're tweeting from the Team Bloomberg account"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"Mike 2020"
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Mike 2020"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"They're just tweeting stuff like this"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"In a Bloomberg administration"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"There will be no tweeting from the Oval Office"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Just an aggressive number of TikToks"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"#BloombergFacts #DemDebate"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"Less Tostitos branding than we expected"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"The candidates are barely mentioning Tostitos"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Which go great with dips, nachos"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Or your favorite party snack recipe"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"#DemDebate"
01:03:58;01:03:59;"I almost get what they're going for"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"That joke"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"It's kind of, it's more weird than funny"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"That joke didn't really land"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Mike can telepathically communicate with dolphins"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"#BloombergFacts #DemDebate"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"That reminds me of like a Chuck Norris joke"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Do you remember like 15 years ago on the internet"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"They were just like, people just used to like"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"F*** themselves reading just s*** that's like"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Chuck Norris is so tough"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"That when he sees a bear"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"The bear runs away"
01:04:21;01:04:26;"That was like an early pre-social media kind of meme"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"There was one I saw on here that"
01:04:28;01:04:28;"Wait, this is a good"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"There was one about the Cracker Barrel"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Which one do you have?"
01:04:32;01:04:32;"I was gonna say"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"In lieu of an inaugural address"
01:04:34;01:04:37;"Mike plans on singing ""Shallow"" with Lady Gaga"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Okay, at least that like, I get it"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"And then Mike from his personal account"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"Responded to a Mike 2020 tweet and added"
01:04:44;01:04:48;"I see everyone at Campaign HQ is hard at work"
01:04:48;01:04:48;"So it's like"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Clearly they took the time to be like"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Okay, you're not gonna be at the debate"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"But we're gonna own Twitter"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"And he's like, how?"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"And he's like, we're just gonna tweet"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"All sorts of fun random stuff"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"It's gonna really get people laughing and going"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"And then you kind of come in and say like"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"Alright guys, jokes aside"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"And that's essentially what he did"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Dropping the hammer here"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Jokes aside"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Can we get serious for a second?"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Yeah, so he said now that my team's got your attention"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Can I just say something?"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"It's just kind of brutal"
01:05:13;01:05:13;"But anyway"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"You had our attention in like"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"The lamest possible sense of the word"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"Right"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"I did like this one kind of"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Which one?"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"For participating in the 1984 debates"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan"
01:05:23;01:05:26;"Each received a $25 Cracker Barrel gift certificate"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Because that almost sounds true"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I don't know why"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"That was the only one where I was like"
01:05:30;01:05:30;"Eh, it's kind of funny"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"It's an alternative history"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Yeah, that's the best one"
01:05:33;01:05:37;"But anyway, I guess the reason I take the time to say that now"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"And maybe because I want to ask her about it"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"I think this kind of mode of using social media"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"Might not exist without Amy Brown"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Right, right"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"So anyway, let's get Amy on the phone"
01:05:46;01:05:46;"And let's uh"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"This is kind of a big deal on Time Crisis"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"We're finally uh"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"I wish Seinfeld was here"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"I know, it's really too bad"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"But this is an interesting episode"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"We're talking to somebody who helped build up"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Early to mid 2000s Pitchfork"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"And somebody helped build up mid 2010s Wendy"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Corporate Twitter"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"Those are two people who helped create modern culture as we know it"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"For better or for worse"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"And they're real TC touchstones"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"That's right"
01:06:10;01:06:14;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
01:06:14;01:06:19;"Hey, it's Amy"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Hey Amy, this is Ezra"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"And you're on Time Crisis with me and Jake"
01:06:22;01:06:22;"Hi"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"Hi"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Before we really get into it"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"We just gotta ask you a real hot button question"
01:06:27;01:06:32;"Are you the person who's behind the Mike Bloomberg campaign tweets?"
01:06:32;01:06:32;"Oh my god"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"Um, no"
01:06:34;01:06:39;"I cannot take responsibility for Mike Bloomberg's face on a meatball"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"I'm sorry"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"I just want to say that"
01:06:41;01:06:47;"Whatever one might think about the modern corporate Twitter escape"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Whether it's Wendy's"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Wendy's savage clapbacks"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Or um"
01:06:52;01:06:55;"Stakehams philosophical musings or whatever"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"At the very least"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"They all feel modern"
01:06:58;01:07:01;"There's something about all these tweets that I was just saying to Jake"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"Reminds me of like pre-social media internet humor"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Just like freaking random"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"Do you remember when there used to be these jokes about like Chuck Norris and stuff?"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"Yeah"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Doesn't have that energy of just like"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Mike Bloomberg facts"
01:07:12;01:07:12;"Yeah"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Mike Bloomberg facts"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Ha ha"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Mike Bloomberg"
01:07:15;01:07:19;"Mike Bloomberg once ate 30 sandwiches in two minutes"
01:07:19;01:07:19;"Ha ha"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"It just feels like"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"He could punch through your face"
01:07:23;01:07:23;"Yeah"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"It's just off"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"So I kind of wonder if"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"We want to get to the bottom of who's behind them"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"And maybe they're a mastermind"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I don't want to be hard on them"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"But it's just like"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"It doesn't feel like somebody under 30"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"It doesn't even feel like somebody under 35"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"I would say 40"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"It doesn't feel like somebody under 40"
01:07:39;01:07:43;"If somehow it's somebody's listening to this show and they're just like"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"23 straight out of college"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"I'm sorry"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"Maybe you're doing 3D chess that we don't understand"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"But you know what I mean?"
01:07:49;01:07:54;"I got the feeling that it's someone at like a marketing agency"
01:07:54;01:07:59;"It sounded very much like marketing agency copywriter to me"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"Not somebody on the campaign who works in politics"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"But has a good sense of humor"
01:08:03;01:08:03;"Yeah"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Like someone who writes ads"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"And that also makes total sense for like a billionaire's campaign"
01:08:08;01:08:08;"They're just like"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Hire a marketing team"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"They have money to flush down the toilet"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"Like why wouldn't they do that?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Right"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"But anyway"
01:08:14;01:08:19;"Now that you have I think convinced us that you're not behind the Bloomberg tweets"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"It's an honor to have you on the show"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"It's an honor to be here"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Thank you for having me"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"I know you've written about this"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"But you know for our listeners who maybe haven't heard the whole story"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"You want to just walk us through the early days"
01:08:29;01:08:33;"How you got the job and lead us up to when you finally first went viral"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"Got your taste of blood and then was off to the races"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Can we hear about that?"
01:08:37;01:08:37;"Sure"
01:08:37;01:08:43;"So I got a job running social media for Wendy's in 2012"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"And what were you doing before that?"
01:08:45;01:08:49;"I was a marketing copywriter for like a small agency in Columbus, Ohio"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Which is Wendy's is based in Dublin, Ohio"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Which is a suburb of Columbus"
01:08:54;01:08:58;"I was writing website copy for like municipal governments and stuff"
01:08:58;01:09:02;"I went to college, I got a journalism degree specifically in newspaper journalism"
01:09:02;01:09:06;"So I graduated and could not get a job at a newspaper"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"You know, I don't want to make too big a deal out of this"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"This sounds familiar"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"But you are the second social media manager"
01:09:12;01:09:16;"Or person who's been involved in doing social media for a fast food brand"
01:09:16;01:09:22;"Who studied journalism and found the job market too brutal and went into that world"
01:09:22;01:09:26;"The other was a guy from a Texas-based wings chain called Pluckers"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Oh, Matt?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"Oh, you know him?"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Yeah, I know him"
01:09:29;01:09:32;"Yeah, we all know each other"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"It's like the mafia"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
01:09:36;01:09:41;"So I got hired in-house at Wendy's"
01:09:41;01:09:41;"I was the first..."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"They didn't have anyone doing it in-house"
01:09:43;01:09:47;"So I got to like come in sort of build this thing"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"We worked with an agency"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"This was back in 2012"
01:09:50;01:09:54;"So nobody was really paying that much attention to what we were doing"
01:09:54;01:09:59;"So internally, we had like a lot of creative freedom to just like do kind of weird stuff"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"And like it sort of flew under the radar"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"That's sort of what I've always enjoyed about social media as like a career"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"Is it's still a creative outlet"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"Still get to do a lot of like interesting weird sh*t"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"Also, I've always just like been on the internet"
01:10:13;01:10:18;"So that's sort of that combines my background in writing and creative stuff"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"With the fact that I was like always on the internet growing up"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"And so you're saying you didn't have a ton of oversight"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"But did you have like a mandate?"
01:10:25;01:10:31;"Were they just like we want you to use this Twitter account to remind people of Wendy's integrity?"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"I mean there were goals and oversight, right?"
01:10:34;01:10:39;"Like we used it for very specific like marketing campaigns"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"I think the number one thing we were trying to do is"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"When I started at Wendy's, they had just undergone a rebrand"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"So like the cups used to be yellow and now they're white"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"And like you know they updated the Wendy logo with the face with the pigtails and stuff"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"And they're taking like old-fashioned off the signs"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"So they're really trying to like"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"And I don't know if you've seen they like redesigned a bunch of their restaurants"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"To make them look more modern"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"So they're really trying to bring a whole new brand to Wendy's"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Because previously it was sort of like"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"I don't know like my grandma really liked Wendy's, right?"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"It's a place where like old people go to get chili"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Like that's what we heard a lot"
01:11:14;01:11:18;"So they're trying to sort of make Wendy's I guess a little bit cooler"
01:11:18;01:11:22;"So this idea of like putting some humanity on Wendy's I guess"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Making it a place that you're not like"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Like if you go get Wendy's and bring it back to the office"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"You're not like sneaking it back into the office"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Was Dave still alive then?"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"No, Dave died in like"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Early 2000s?"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"Yeah early 2000s"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"So I can imagine that the post-Dave"
01:11:39;01:11:42;"Who literally was the human face of Wendy's"
01:11:42;01:11:42;"Yeah"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"That then after that you're like"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"All right, you got this kind of sweet old man"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"Named his chain after his daughter"
01:11:49;01:11:49;"That's real old-fashioned"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"But then once he's gone"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"It's like old-fashioned for no reason"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"That must have been an awkward time"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Yeah and they sort of"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I think from a business standpoint too"
01:11:58;01:12:02;"Which is not really like my area of interest or expertise"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"But I think they sort of"
01:12:03;01:12:04;"You have fast food, right?"
01:12:04;01:12:07;"But then they also started to see all these fast casual restaurants closing in"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"Like Five Guys and Chipotle"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"And like all these restaurants that aren't quite fast food"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"But are like a little bit nicer"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"They're trying to make Wendy's seem like a little bit nicer"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"A little more upscale"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"Like trying to get people to consider going to Wendy's"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Who maybe hadn't considered going to Wendy's before"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Or maybe not in a long time"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"So sort of doing like a lot of different things"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"With the Twitter account, right?"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"Like there's always like a limited time sandwich"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"For four to six weeks"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"So just like getting people to know"
01:12:36;01:12:40;"That there's this like super mega Baconator or whatever"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Yeah of course they're gonna be saying like"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Super mega Baconator's on sale"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"Or you know buy one get one free whatever"
01:12:46;01:12:50;"Or you know we opened a new Wendy's in you know Tampa"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"But from the start where they were like"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"In between those tweets you know"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Just have fun"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"Or even in the beginning that wasn't part of it"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Because now we take it for granted"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"That if you're a social media manager"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Your job is to just go viral"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"But like"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Just like brawl with other brands"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Yeah and just like kind of get into it"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"So yeah but back then was it kind of just like"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"You know make sure that people are aware of the campaigns"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"And you know come up with some creative ideas"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"Like something light irreverent"
01:13:14;01:13:19;"Yeah no all the tweets had some sort of business purpose right"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"Like get people thinking about eating Wendy's"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"The place where we had the most creative freedom"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"And the least oversight I would say"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"Where I think you probably saw"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Where Wendy's started to go viral"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"And continued to go viral"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"Is where we got to like reply back and forth to people"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Because there actually was kind of"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"For every post that is just like"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"Written and outbound"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"It goes through like the social media manager"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"And a brand marketer"
01:13:45;01:13:48;"And like an entire legal department"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"So there is kind of like a lot of oversight"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"For social posts"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Every single tweet including replies?"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Not replies"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"That's why replies are like the ones that"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Are more fun and can go viral"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Because those don't have as much of an approval process"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"But yeah like if you see a tweet from a brand"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"That's just like a standalone tweet"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"That's not like to another human being"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Like it's probably been reviewed and approved"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"By five or six different people"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Including a legal department"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"So you're saying that's kind of standard"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"At most big companies?"
01:14:18;01:14:18;"Yeah"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"It's weird in a way though"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Because it's like"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"You can get in a lot of trouble"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"Tweeting at individual people too"
01:14:25;01:14:25;"Yes"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"I got the mega Baconator tweet approved"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"But then you know when I told that guy to"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"F*** my d***"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"I was low within my rights"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"Legally, legally"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"Redhead with some pigtails"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Better check the score of these meals sold"
01:14:39;01:14:39;"Now that's better"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"I'm so clever"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"My bars chilly"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"Better grab a sweater"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"You blocked my tweets"
01:14:43;01:14:43;"King Squash the beef"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Now you check my feed"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"And your eyes swelling"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"How you love that?"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"These straight facts"
01:14:47;01:14:47;"Tryna take the sweat"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"But we don't want it back"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"I'm a boss chick"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"And they hate with that"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"But we tried your food"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Where the flavor at?"
01:14:52;01:14:52;"You number one"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"That's a joke"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"Why your ice cream machine always broke?"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"Why your drive-thru always slow?"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Why your innovation just can't grow?"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"It's Queen when you need the same old"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"Nope"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"That Baconator go crazy"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"That spicy chicken go crazy"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"You can take a fry and dip it in the sauce"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"It still be so tasty"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Them little tweets don't face me"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"McDonald's be so lazy"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"I know the reason you hate me"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"'Cause I'm fast food's first lady"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"It's Queen when you need the same old"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"So you always had that in your back pocket"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"'Cause that is"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"And I just want to tell the listeners"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"That is how Amy first went viral"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"Which as I'm looking at it"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"I gotta say this"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"This is a great exchange"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Somebody tweeted at Wendy's"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"""Your beef is frozen and we all know it"""
01:15:30;01:15:31;"You guys"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"We laugh at your slogan"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"""Fresh never frozen"" right?"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"Like you're really a joke"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"And then you"
01:15:36;01:15:36;"Straight up you"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"Not Wendy's"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"But you Amy"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Tweeted"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"""Sorry to hear you think that"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"But you're wrong"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"We've only ever used fresh beef"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"Since we were founded in 1969"""
01:15:44;01:15:46;"Still kind of corporate"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"You know just like really political"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"And then he wrote"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"""So you deliver it raw on a hot truck?"""
01:15:51;01:15:53;"And then"
01:15:53;01:15:56;"That's a very confusing question"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"And then you wrote"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"""Where do you store cold things that aren't frozen?"""
01:15:59;01:16:00;"And then he wrote back"
01:16:00;01:16:01;"""Y'all should give up"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"McDonald's got you guys beat with a dope-ass breakfast"""
01:16:04;01:16:06;"And then this is the moment that"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Sealed the fate of this man"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"And also everybody on Twitter"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"You wrote"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"""You don't have to bring them into this"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"Just because you forgot refrigerators existed for a second there"""
01:16:16;01:16:17;"And I mean when you're right you're right"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"This guy was talking nonsense"
01:16:19;01:16:20;"So I guess"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"When you had this exchange"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"Had you already had some kind of like edgy replies?"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Because that's where you were always allowed to have the most freedom?"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"Or was this the crossing of the Rubicon?"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"We had gradually worked up to that point"
01:16:33;01:16:34;"About a year prior to that"
01:16:34;01:16:37;"We'd had an exchange with someone"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"It was about Burger King"
01:16:39;01:16:42;"Where Wendy's introduced the 4 for 4 meal"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"And then Burger King introduced like a 5 for 4 meal"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"And they did a tweet that was like"
01:16:47;01:16:50;"""5 for 4 because 5 is better than 4"""
01:16:50;01:16:53;"And we had decided internally"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"That we were like gonna not address it at all"
01:16:55;01:16:56;"Not say anything"
01:16:56;01:17:00;"But then people kept tagging Wendy's into this tweet"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"And someone said"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"""Wendy's what are you guys firing back?"""
01:17:04;01:17:05;"So I was in like"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"I was in like the middle of a meeting or something"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"And I just wrote back ""edible food"""
01:17:09;01:17:11;"And that one went super viral"
01:17:11;01:17:16;"But we had some moments like that in the lead up to this one"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"The one you just read that ended up on like Anderson Cooper and stuff"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"When you're at the forefront of a conversation like that"
01:17:22;01:17:23;"As things start picking up"
01:17:23;01:17:27;"For you did you start to identify more with Wendy's the brand?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Did your egos merge?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Did it become a Donnie Brosco situation?"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"Which you're so deep into cover you don't even know"
01:17:33;01:17:34;"Or I guess the departed"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"Where you're so deep into undercover"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"You don't know up from down anymore"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Did it kind of reach a point where you and Wendy's just like"
01:17:41;01:17:45;"Became one and you were just kind of like"
01:17:45;01:17:46;"""F*** the haters"""
01:17:46;01:17:49;"Because the voice of Wendy's eventually kind of became a little bit like"
01:17:49;01:17:49;"""F*** you"""
01:17:49;01:17:51;"So I'm curious"
01:17:51;01:17:55;"Did you always have like a lightness about it or a sense of humor?"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Or did you occasionally come home and speak to a loved one?"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"And they were just like"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"""What's going on with you?"""
01:18:00;01:18:02;"""What's going on? You used to leave work at work"""
01:18:02;01:18:04;"""But now it's like..."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Now I feel like you want to give me a savage clap back"""
01:18:06;01:18:11;"Tell us about the next phase as things got hot"
01:18:11;01:18:15;"Well so what immediately happened is that roast went viral"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"And people sort of started coming"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"And they were like ""Roast me! Do me next!"""
01:18:19;01:18:22;"And there were three of us at that time"
01:18:22;01:18:22;"We had sort of grown"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"There was one guy on the agency side"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"And two of us internally at Wendy's"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"And we're all like taking turns"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"Replying to people, like taking shifts at night"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"Like ""I'll take the 1am shift"""
01:18:33;01:18:33;"Right?"
01:18:33;01:18:36;"Because it was..."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"We hadn't really planned for this"
01:18:38;01:18:42;"We were getting more tweets in 24 hours than we used to get in like a month"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"But we also like didn't want to stop replying to them"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Because we were afraid it would stop"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"I can't speak for the other two"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"I know that I did sort of like..."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"I was not getting enough sleep"
01:18:53;01:18:56;"Or spending enough time outside the internet"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"And I did like..."
01:18:57;01:19:03;"Because when you spend that much time inside of anyone's Twitter mentions"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"It is really not good for your brain"
01:19:05;01:19:05;"Right"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"And then eventually you chose to leave Wendy's?"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"You'd had enough?"
01:19:09;01:19:09;"Yeah"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"So the frozen beef thing that went viral"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Happened in January of 2017"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"And I left in like March or April of that year"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"When you left, did you know what you were going to get into?"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Or you just knew you needed to leave?"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"I knew I wanted to take like a month or two off"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Just to not do anything"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"I went to... this sounds so lame"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"I went to Joshua Tree"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"Oh tight"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"That's not lame at all"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Joshua Tree rules"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Jake is a big Joshua Tree fan"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I feel like that's just such a such a cliche thing to say"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Like I went to the desert to find myself"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"I went to Joshua Tree"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"And then I went to Death Valley"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"Just to like be out where there were no people"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"And not be on the internet for a while"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"Yeah I mean that's a hell of a 180"
01:19:48;01:19:51;"Just like Wendy's social media manager"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Just like hundreds of thousands of tweets"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Like every possible point of view and opinion"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Just like yelling at you"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"And then just in the emptiness"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Of Death Valley?"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Of America, yeah"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"Death Valley is no joke"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Oh it ruled"
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Yeah were you by yourself?"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"You just like solo camping?"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Yeah I went by myself"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"I got like an Airbnb"
01:20:09;01:20:13;"And I came back and I freelanced for about a year"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"So really just like took on"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Still in advertising stuff?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Yeah marketing advertising stuff"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"So I worked mostly just through like word of mouth"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"And people I knew"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"Picked up some projects working with like non-profits"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"And smaller businesses"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"A couple of like tech companies"
01:20:30;01:20:35;"And then I ended up at Postmates in San Francisco"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"In early 2018"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"Which moved my family out to California"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"And then I was there for a little bit"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"But then I left to join a campaign"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"To impeach the president"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"But then that campaign ended"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"When the funder of the campaign"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"Decided to run for president"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"So then I ran social media"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"For Tom Steyer's presidential campaign"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"For like three months"
01:20:56;01:20:56;"Whoa"
01:20:56;01:21:00;"Are you still working for Steyer?"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"No I left there in September"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"And that's when you started working for Bloomberg?"
01:21:05;01:21:12;"Yeah so you left Tom Steyer's campaign and"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Took a couple months off"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"And now I am like"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"I'm like eight days into a new job at"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"It's a company called Figma"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"They're a design tool that helps"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"Creative people make websites and apps and stuff"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"I think part of the reason that Jake and I"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Have what"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"It's a topic that always comes up on this show"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Because it's fascinating"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"On the one hand"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"There are companies that use it"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"Marketing and advertising in such a craven way"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"That you do kind of feel like"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"They are actively"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"Harshing out the environment we all live in"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"But then at the same time"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"There's also a part"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"You know"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Jake's a painter"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I'm a poet"
01:21:49;01:21:53;"And I think we also can see the art of it"
01:21:53;01:21:54;"To some extent"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"You know people who work in the commercial arts"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"We have more in common than we'd want to admit sometimes"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"With brands and brand twitter and things like that"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"So I'm curious"
01:22:01;01:22:02;"Somebody's been through so many things"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"You were saying"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Yes you've seen that dark side"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"But ultimately"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Is it a"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"I guess it's just a tool"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"That can be used for good or evil"
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Like how do you think of it?"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"The very simple answer to your question is that"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"I really hate marketing and advertising"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"I think the thing that really drew me to social media"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Was that I like communities"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"I like figuring out what connects people"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"And what makes people tick"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"I don't necessarily like the aspect of that"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"Where I am trying to sell people sh*t"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Right"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"But coming from"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"I guess when I was"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"I grew up in like a really small town"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"In the middle of nowhere in Ohio"
01:22:39;01:22:42;"And most of my friends were in the internet"
01:22:42;01:22:42;"Like on the computer"
01:22:42;01:22:46;"And I guess that form of communication"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Has always been sort of second nature to me"
01:22:49;01:22:53;"And so I think just this process"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Of like seeking out like-minded people"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And finding new ways to connect with them"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"I think can be very meaningful"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"And I think as I've progressed in my career"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"I've tried to find a way to do that"
01:23:03;01:23:06;"That's not just like some craven way"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Of getting people to buy more sh*t"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"But that is like"
01:23:09;01:23:09;"I don't know"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Something that matters"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"Something that's like"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"Changing the world"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Which sounds a little more noble"
01:23:16;01:23:19;"Than is realistic for most people"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Or like I don't know"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"In my new gig it's like"
01:23:21;01:23:24;"Working with an artistic community"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"Instead of trying to like"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Sell a cheeseburger"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"So I guess the answer to your question is"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"I think about it all the time"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Right I think about like"
01:23:31;01:23:34;"What am I doing working in advertising"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"But then I also think about like"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"We all live under capitalism"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Like we all gotta make a living under capitalism"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"So maybe what I have to do is just like"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Do my job"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"While being the least disruptive"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"And not annoying as possible right"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"I know what you mean"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"The way that Mac from Pluckers put it is"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"It's a dumb time to be alive"
01:23:54;01:23:59;"That's his catchphrase for how he answers"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"The difficult questions about how we all"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Make our way through this compromised world"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"I've had a thought recently"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"And you know Jake and I have often"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"Talked so much about like"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Corporate social media"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"And the things about it that bother us"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"But I have had increasingly of this thought"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"As I kind of learn about"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Even more about this world we live in"
01:24:16;01:24:16;"And you learn about"
01:24:16;01:24:19;"There's a book that actually Obama"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"Put on his end of the year book list"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"That I was reading called"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"
01:24:24;01:24:25;"And it talks very specifically about"
01:24:25;01:24:29;"Facebook and Google and Amazon"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"And trying to"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"The woman wrote it Shoshana Zuboff"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"She's trying to provide a framework"
01:24:34;01:24:37;"And a vocabulary for a way to understand"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"Something that we all kind of understand"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"But it's complicated"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"And anyway I guess what I'm saying is"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"The way she talks about surveillance capitalism"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"And the way that money is made"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Based off our data"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"And our behavior on the internet"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"When you read about that stuff"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"And it's just like it's so intense"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"It almost sometimes makes you think"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"You know what?"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Trying to make somebody laugh"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"Or get their attention"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"So they'll buy your cheeseburger"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Seems quaint"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"It seems kind of like straightforward"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"And like not that bad"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"You know what I mean?"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"Like yeah and maybe that's just the trajectory"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"We're on as a country or a world"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"It's like as things just get harsher and harsher"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"You just look back to the previous era's harshness"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"And you're like say what you will"
01:25:16;01:25:19;"But it certainly wasn't that bad"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Three years ago not that crazy"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Well thanks so much Amy"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"And it's been great hearing your story"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"And it's a fascinating journey"

01:25:29;01:25:31;"Because you know"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"As much as we like hearing the history of WEND"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"It's also cool just to hear your take on"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Some of the other social media happenings"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Yeah thanks for having me on"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Happy to do it again if you ever need"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Thoughts on the internet"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Absolutely well thanks so much Amy"
01:25:45;01:25:45;"Have a good one"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Have a good one"
01:25:47;01:25:47;"Bye"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Let's get in the top five"

01:25:52;01:25:55;"On iTunes"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"This week's top five"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"We're going to compare the top five Billboard hits"
01:25:59;01:26:02;"This week in 2006"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"To the top five songs on Apple Music right now"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"The Apple Music top 100 global chart"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Yeah not iTunes"
01:26:09;01:26:09;"Nope"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"And it's not just domestic"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"It's just global streams"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"This is global"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"So we want to welcome our friends"
01:26:16;01:26:20;"From places like Mexico and Canada"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"Why did we choose 2006?"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"I truly have no idea"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"I think it was the year that the Jet record came out"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"Oh right in the review"
01:26:27;01:26:28;"Yes"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Okay so this one's going out to Chris"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"So the number five song this week in 2006"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Wow this is really starting to feel like a"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"I mean that's 14 years ago"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"But this feels like decades ago"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"Nickelback photograph"
01:26:42;01:26:48;"Yeah I meant to ask Chris"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"If Pitchfork reviewed Nickelback"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"Because why were they reviewing Jet in the first place?"
01:26:55;01:26:58;"Jet was like close enough to like stuff they would review"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"Because they didn't review Nickelback did they?"
01:27:01;01:27:02;"I don't think so"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"I never knew we ever would without"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"The second floor is hot for sneaking up"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"But this is where I went to school"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Most of the time"
01:27:13;01:27:14;"This band is kind of like"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"People used to hate on this band"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Well this band's kind of like the Eagles in a way"
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Like widely loved and widely reviled"
01:27:21;01:27:21;"Yeah"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"I mean this guy's vocal approach is insane"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"It's too late"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"Should I go back and try to graduate"
01:27:28;01:27:31;"Last minute now that it was back then"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Is it auto-tuned?"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"It's auto-tuned and like"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Is he harmonizing with himself or is it just double-tracked?"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Or is this like octaves?"
01:27:38;01:27:47;"I was kind of with it up till this point"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"This is just too much"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"Chad Kroger told CBC"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"It's just nostalgia"
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Growing up in a small town and you can't go back to your childhood"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Saying goodbye to friends that you've drifted away from"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Where you grew up"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Where you went to school"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"All right"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"That's what this song is about"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Yeah"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"I mean it's kind of similar subject matter to"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"The beautiful R.E.M. song ""Night Swimming"""
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Because that's just like"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"Photograph on the dashboard"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Taken years ago"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"All I remember from that is the chorus"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"Night swimming deserves a quiet night"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"To me that song is like evoking"
01:28:20;01:28:24;"Yeah like a summer night in like your small town"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"So he's thinking back to those nights when they went night swimming"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Yeah"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"And there's like a yellowed photograph of like his friends"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"On the dash"
01:28:31;01:28:35;"I could be wrong but that's how I have always thought about night swimming"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"What's Def Leppard photograph about?"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"I think that's more"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"It's like a pinup girl or something?"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"I think so"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"That's a great song"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"That Def Leppard photograph"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"I wanna touch you"
01:28:44;01:28:50;"The Chad Kroger guy kind of reminds me a little bit of like"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"The Def Leppard vocal sound"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Just like hyped up"
01:28:54;01:28:54;"Yeah"
01:28:54;01:28:59;"Joe Elliott, the lead singer of Def Leppard described photograph being about"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"Quote ""something you can't ever get your hands on"""
01:29:02;01:29:03;"Wow"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"That's deep"
01:29:04;01:29:09;"I guess there's a whole rich tradition of people writing songs about like photos"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"Images"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"That's also interesting to think that we're probably not gonna get as many good"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"Photograph songs in the future because it's"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Just images on your phone"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Physical"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"I mean somebody I could write"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"It would just have a different feeling of just like"
01:29:21;01:29:25;"One day scrolled back too far"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"Now I'm looking at a pic from nine years ago"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"I haven't seen it in a few months"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Hershey's like"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"We were down at the lake shore"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"I got an email from Facebook"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"Reminded me of some sh*t that happened in the past man"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"I didn't want to think about it"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"Now I am"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"But there's something about like"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"The photograph is like this physical thing"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Immediate"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"I don't want to say it's sad or"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"But it's like"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"It's more of this like pure metaphor where it's like"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"The past is gone"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"There's no traces"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"All you have is this little square in your hand"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"You're holding this small little thing"
01:29:59;01:29:59;"Which is like"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"Which is starting to yellow"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"And like"
01:30:02;01:30:03;"Yeah like it's on its way out"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"And like yeah"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Even this photo won't be around forever"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"No"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"There is something about just like"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"You're holding this tiny little piece of history"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"This tiny little fragile thing"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Versus like something you've like backed up to the cloud"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Plus like"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"You could like text other people just being like"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Hey you remember that night in uh"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"'07"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"We went swimming in the lake at night"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"I lost my phone"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Like I lost a lot of pictures"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"Just be like"
01:30:26;01:30:26;"Oh yeah yeah"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"I'll go on the Facebook group and uh"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Yeah here's 30 other alternative angles"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Yeah dude night swimming deserves a quiet night"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"I agree"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"So anyway I don't know I guess"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Nickelback very meaningful song"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"Made us think man"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"So that song is kind of deep"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"I don't know about this song"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"We heard this for the first time on Time Crisis"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"There's got to be more to this song"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"But this is a wild pop song"
01:30:49;01:30:50;"Dance Monkey"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Tones and I"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"I don't know what it is"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"This is a big hit"
01:30:55;01:31:00;"They say oh my god I see the way you shine"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Oh we've heard this before right"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"Yeah remember"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Dance monkey dance monkey"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"Take your hand my D and place them both in my"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"My U"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"You know you'll stop me dead"
01:31:09;01:31:12;"Oh that's right this person was like a busker"
01:31:12;01:31:12;"Yeah I guess"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"We read this right"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Yeah she lived in a van with her friends"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"I'd wake up at six"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Otherwise I'd wake up in a ball of sweat"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"Then we'd go down to the beach or play basketball"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"And then go busk at night for like four or five hours"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"It was a good life"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"Sounds cool"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Everyone talks about how it must have been difficult"
01:31:27;01:31:27;"But it really wasn't"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"It was probably the best time I've ever had"
01:31:29;01:31:32;"Oh all right that's endearing"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"That's some summer 69 sh*t"
01:31:34;01:31:37;"I got my first real six string"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Bought it at the five and dime"
01:31:39;01:31:43;"Living in a van playing basketball"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"The number four song back in '06"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Mariah Carey ""Don't Forget About Us"""
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Do I know this one?"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Don't forget about us"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"Don't baby, no baby, don't forget about us"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Don't baby, don't baby, don't"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"I remember this one"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"She had a bunch of hits off this record"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"17th chart-topping single from Mariah Carey"
01:32:06;01:32:10;"Tying Elvis Presley for most number ones by a solo artist"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"And then she'd break it in 2008"
01:32:13;01:32:13;"That's insane"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"You know sometimes it be like that baby"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Now every time I see you"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"Just a solid R&B song"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"I'm a Mariah Carey fan"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"Do you like Mariah Carey?"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"I do actually"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"You know what I like about her too?"
01:32:30;01:32:31;"Kind of the same reason I like Billy Joel"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Just a real tri-state energy"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"Is she Long Island just like Joel?"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"Yeah she's Long Island"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"Yeah I don't get the specific tri-state energy but"
01:32:40;01:32:44;"Maybe also because she's like Derek Jeter and stuff"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Oh that's right"
01:32:45;01:32:48;"And there's something about that that I can just like picture that"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Like the Long Island girl who's just like"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Well I'm dating a Yankee"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"That's really funny"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"She's tri-state energy for sure"
01:32:56;01:33:01;"The number four song right now on Apple Music"
01:33:01;01:33:05;"So this is a guy who recently just topped the Billboard charts too"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"His name is Roddy Ricch"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"I only know one of his songs"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"It's not this one"
01:33:10;01:33:14;"But he actually stopped Justin Bieber from going to number one on the Billboard this week"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"With his comeback single ""Yummy"""
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Which was widely panned"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Have you heard ""Yummy"" Jake?"
01:33:18;01:33:18;"I have not heard ""Yummy"""
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Did you know that Bieber is back?"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"No"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I heard he had Lyme disease"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Yeah I guess he came out and he"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"That's what I heard recently"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Said that he had Lyme disease"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"That's tough"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"That's intense"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"Chronic Lyme"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"That's brutal"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Yeah"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"From what I know about it"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"And I've always been paranoid about getting it you know"
01:33:35;01:33:36;"When I'm in a"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"Tri-state dude"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"It's very tri-state"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"Lyme, Connecticut"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"That's right it's from yeah Lyme, Connecticut"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Wait did I actually tell this story on TC?"
01:33:44;01:33:44;"I don't think I did"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"What's that?"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"I've always been so paranoid about"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"Because also growing up"
01:33:49;01:33:52;"The places that we would go on vacation would be like"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"Upstate New York or something"
01:33:54;01:33:54;"Sure sure"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"So just tick country"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"And so I remember being a kid and like"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Me and my sister going somewhere"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"And just like my mom always being like"
01:34:02;01:34:03;"The kids you know"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Maybe we go with another family"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"And we're staying at somebody's house upstate New York"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"The kids come in from playing and always be"
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Tick check"
01:34:10;01:34:10;"Oh yeah"
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Tick check"

01:34:12;01:34:14;"That it's you cannot get bit by a tick"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"Yeah"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"And then when you ever see a tick on you"
01:34:17;01:34:18;"It's like you get stressed out"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"And then so I've had time"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"There's one time I went to Shelter Island"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Which is like one of the most ticked out places on earth"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"That's out in between the two forks of Long Island"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"I just remember like getting back from that trip"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"And just like feeling crazy tired"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"And I just got in my head so I like"
01:34:31;01:34:32;"I was like you know I'm going to the doctor"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"F*** this I need to find out"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Didn't turn out to have Lyme disease"
01:34:35;01:34:39;"But then Vampire Weekend was doing our tech rehearsals"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"For Father of the Bride"
01:34:40;01:34:41;"You know just like we're"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Kind of get to go play off big speakers"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"Make sure everything sounds right"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Make sure the lighting rig works"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"And is programmed and the globe spin"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"All the you know making sure like the big show is ready"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"And we did it out in like semi-rural Connecticut"
01:34:56;01:34:57;"And so I was out there for a few days"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"And I remember like I came back to the city"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"And I was taking a shower"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"And I felt like this funny thing on my side"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"And I kind of was like flicking it"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"And then I felt like I watched something go down the drain"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"And then I looked back"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"And I had this kind of like circular mark"
01:35:10;01:35:11;"And I was just like"
01:35:11;01:35:11;"Damn it"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"It finally happened"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"So I'm like thinking about I'm like"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"You know what I feel okay let's not"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"But I was like then you know reading up like"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"Get all paranoid this stuff can hit whenever"
01:35:18;01:35:21;"And it's funny Jake that you point out that Lyme, Connecticut"
01:35:21;01:35:24;"Because that's the thing I vaguely knew"
01:35:24;01:35:25;"But I didn't really think about it"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Or maybe I just it sounded familiar"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"But I didn't cross my mind"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"And so I go to the doctor"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"They're like what's up"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"And I'm like look basically I feel like maybe I was bit by a tick"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"I got this circular thing"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"It looks kind of like a tick bite"
01:35:38;01:35:39;"They're like well do you feel weird"
01:35:39;01:35:40;"And I was like no"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"But you know that's like going on tour forever"
01:35:42;01:35:46;"And the idea that I didn't get this checked out like while I'm"
01:35:46;01:35:46;"Here"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Here yeah"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Feels like we I don't want to like in four months"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"Be feeling the symptoms of chronic Lyme disease"
01:35:52;01:35:53;"And then she's like well have you been anywhere rural"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"And I was like just a little bit"
01:35:55;01:35:56;"Like I wasn't in upstate New York"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"I wasn't out on Long Island"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Because those are the places I associate the most with Lyme disease"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"I was like I was in Connecticut a little bit"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"I was like is there a lot of Lyme disease in Connecticut"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"And she's like well it is named after old Lyme, Connecticut"
01:36:07;01:36:10;"I was like say it ain't so doc"
01:36:11;01:36:15;"Anyway the way I saw that Justin Bieber said he had Lyme disease"
01:36:15;01:36:20;"Was that his wife made a post that's like hey guys like Lyme disease is real"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Like I don't understand this Lyme"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Yeah because I know that there's stuff like chronic fatigue syndrome"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"That people debate endlessly and people say no it's real"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"I have it I suffer because of it"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"And people are like no that's made up"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"But if Lyme disease you can test for it"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"It's like you have it or you don't"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"And it has symptoms like what's this like Lyme disease is a myth thing"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"I don't know"
01:36:39;01:36:42;"Maybe people are like extra skeptical of chronic Lyme disease"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"But it's like why"
01:36:43;01:36:46;"Maybe it's hard to attribute certain symptoms to"
01:36:46;01:36:49;"Definitively being attached to Lyme"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"I don't know"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Well anyway poor guy's got chronic Lyme disease"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"And people are trashing his new song"
01:36:54;01:36:58;"And he got bumped off the top by Roddy Ricch"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Maybe next time we'll play his song Yummy"
01:37:00;01:37:00;"This would definitely be"
01:37:00;01:37:01;"I like the title"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"And I bet you would like this line from Yummy"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"We won't play it but because it's all it's kind of like a love song"
01:37:06;01:37:11;"He's basically saying to his wife you're yummy or your body's yummy"
01:37:11;01:37:11;"Something like that"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"Yeah"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"It's positive about her"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"And there's a part that I like he goes"
01:37:15;01:37:20;"I just don't think there's anything wrong with that song"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"People are just like"
01:37:21;01:37:24;"It was just knives out for Bieber this time"
01:37:24;01:37:25;"But he goes"
01:37:25;01:37:28;"I'm elated that you are my lady"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Okay"
01:37:29;01:37:32;"I was like that's kind of like from like some 70s power ballad"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"Sure"
01:37:33;01:37:34;"Like a journey song"
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Right"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"I'm elated"
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Bum bum bum bum"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"I'm elated"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"Bum bum"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"That you are my lady"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"It's a great line"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"But he's"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"Yeah I can see Steve Perry singing that"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Yeah but in this Bieber it's like trapping"
01:37:50;01:37:50;"He goes like"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"I'm elated that you are my lady"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"You know what the problem is?"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"He should have called the song elated"
01:37:56;01:37:56;"Yeah"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"Yummy is fun but for some people it's too cutesy"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Anyway Roddy Ricch"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"We are just crawling through this top five here"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Let's pick up the pace"
01:38:03;01:38:06;"This is Roddy Ricch ""High Fashion"" featuring Mustard"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Featuring Mustard?"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"I guess that's DJ Mustard"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Formerly known as DJ Mustard"
01:38:10;01:38:10;"Cool name"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"He's playing Coachella"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"Are you guys playing Coachella this year?"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"No not this year"
01:38:17;01:38:22;"I think we'll make our return when the time is right but"
01:38:22;01:38:22;"Sure"
01:38:22;01:38:29;"Bieber just posted"
01:38:32;01:38:36;"He's the first artist in history to rank number one on the Hot R&B song"
01:38:36;01:38:39;"Yummy and Hot Country songs for 10,000 hours"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"At the same time"
01:38:41;01:38:42;"All right that's something"
01:38:42;01:38:47;"I'm sure all the haters are like yeah but you weren't number one on the main chart"
01:38:47;01:38:50;"Life's hard"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I ain't no player I just got a lot of bae"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"But let me tell you I like you a lot bae"
01:38:56;01:38:56;"The number"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Pretty low key, pretty minimal"
01:38:58;01:38:58;"Minimal"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"Not that different than Yummy"
01:39:01;01:39:05;"The number three song is Beyonce ""Check On It"" featuring Slim Thug"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Oh I remember when this came out"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"I was in college when this came out"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"I love this song"
01:39:09;01:39:15;"This is like from a movie or something"
01:39:15;01:39:20;"Oh wait this is from the Pink Panther movie which Beyonce also starred in"
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Really? I don't remember that at all"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"Beyonce used to be in a lot more movies"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"She was in an Austin Powers movie"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"She starred in the Pink Panther film?"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"I guess alongside Steve Martin"
01:39:29;01:39:30;"Is that right?"
01:39:30;01:39:30;"Weird"
01:39:30;01:39:39;"I remember this song"
01:39:39;01:39:40;"Yeah it's a good song"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Yeah totally"
01:39:41;01:39:42;"It's also got Bun B on it"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Shout out to Bun B"
01:39:43;01:39:49;"It's like slower than I remember"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Great Hype Williams video to this"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Oh yeah"
01:39:52;01:39:57;"We're like cutting to random footage of Steve Martin in the Pink Panther"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Being like ""Ooooh"""
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Should've let Steve Martin have a verse on that"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Banjo solo"
01:40:03;01:40:06;"I can actually picture a banjo version of that song pretty well"
01:40:06;01:40:09;"The number three song back in 2020"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"Can you believe it we're in the 20s?"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"Lil Baby ""Some To Prove"""
01:40:12;01:40:13;"I'm hearing everybody talking"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"Wait you know this right currently we have two big baby rappers"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"Lil Baby and DaBaby"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"I haven't really spent a lot of time with either their music but"
01:40:22;01:40:25;"When it rains it pours you know"
01:40:25;01:40:26;"I love this do you?"

01:40:35;01:40:38;"Right is he like more have more pop appeal or something?"
01:40:38;01:40:42;"Yeah and sort of a much more like straightforward rapper"

01:46:23;01:46:26;"- There's some things I like about this song, but..."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"So by the way, this is from an album,"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"a double album that Nelly made called ""Sweatsuit."""
01:46:30;01:46:31;"- Good title."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"- Well, it's even better than you think"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"because the two discs,"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"one was sweat and one was suit."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"And sweat was kind of like down and dirty, sexy."
01:46:39;01:46:43;"And suit, I remember, had some kind of cool R&B ballad."

01:46:52;01:46:54;"maybe I'm not looking at it in the right context,"
01:46:54;01:46:58;"but it's like, it reminds me of parody stuff from that era."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"I can just picture, and this is a note,"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"Nelly, Pawel, these people all made excellent music,"

01:48:40;01:48:43;"like hearing like grills."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"It just feels like a million years ago."
01:48:45;01:48:48;"Anyway, the number one song in the country"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"and also on the Apple store right now"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"is another song from Roddy Ricch."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"So we heard ""High Fashion."""
01:48:54;01:48:57;"Not a bad song, didn't make a very big impression on us,"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"but the box, this is the big hit."
01:49:00;01:49:03;"And this is what's putting Roddy Ricch on the map."
01:49:03;01:49:06;"And this is what stopped Justin Bieber."

01:49:08;01:49:10;"I'm gonna do ""Take It Upon Myself"""
01:49:10;01:49:12;"just to make a yummy remix called ""Elated."""
01:49:12;01:49:13;"So let's hear it."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"This is the box."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"I mean, I was struck as soon as I saw the name, the box."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"- Yeah, it's an intriguing title."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"- What does he mean by the box?"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"The first thing I thought of is the club"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"in New York and London."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"- I'm familiar."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"- You ever been to the box?"
01:49:25;01:49:25;"- No."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"- I mean, already just the..."
01:49:33;01:49:41;"- Put a steak in the box?"
01:49:43;01:49:47;"- You can just tell there's like an energy to this."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"This is like somebody with a vision and focus."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- I don't know."
01:49:51;01:49:54;"I feel old on this top five, I gotta tell you."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"They sound all the same to me."
01:49:56;01:49:59;"I don't have a way to be, even like evaluate this."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"But it's like, you have to hear this song a couple of times."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"Like eventually, it's like the more you hear it,"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"you're like, ""Oh yeah, that's what sets it apart."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"That's catchy."""
01:50:06;01:50:08;"But hold on, I really have no idea what it's about though."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"I've been pretty checked out too."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"I feel old too."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Pulling out the coupe at the lot,"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"told him, ""(beep) 12, (beep) SWAT."""
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Jake, do you know what (beep) 12 means?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- No."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"- Guess, I bet you could guess."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"(Jake sighs)"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- I have no idea what that means."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"- Well, let's say what's the most common thing"
01:50:23;01:50:27;"that rap songs say (beep) to, you know, historically?"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"- Other rappers?"
01:50:29;01:50:29;"- Not a bad guess."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"This is like super family feud."
01:50:31;01:50:35;"It's like where somebody makes like a fairly logical,"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"informed guess, but we're just like, ""Eh, not on the board."""
01:50:38;01:50:39;"- Hmm."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"(beep)"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"12, (beep) SWAT."
01:50:42;01:50:45;"I mean, SWAT is not like a SWAT team."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"- I think it is."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"- Okay, so like police?"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"- Yeah, police."
01:50:49;01:50:50;"- What is 12?"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"- Actually, I don't know."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"But people always say that, ""(beep) 12."""
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Close reading of the box here."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Here we go."
01:50:55;01:50:56;"- Oh, it's an Atlanta thing."
01:50:56;01:50:59;"According to sources, 12 comes from the radio,"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"the police radio code 10-12,"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"which means that visitors are present"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"in the area where the police are going."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"I mean, you know, it's like Hawaii Five-0."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"Police refer to it as like a number."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"It kind of like makes sense."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"So anyway, a few months prior to the release of this track,"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"Roddy was arrested for domestic violence."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"He also spent two weeks in county jail,"
01:51:14;01:51:17;"which ironically acted as the catalyst for his music career."

01:51:23;01:51:24;"- Jail is weak."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"- That's a tight call."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"- It's like, Jake gets locked up."
01:51:30;01:51:32;"Dude, locked up for two years."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"- Sucked, man."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"- How was it?"
01:51:34;01:51:35;"- Weak."
01:51:35;01:51:40;"- Busting all the bells out the box."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- Okay."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- I just hit a lick with the box."
01:51:42;01:51:43;"No, I actually don't know."
01:51:43;01:51:44;"- Busting out."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"- I got a question."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Sometimes I wonder with Genius."
01:51:46;01:51:48;"I think Genius has maybe enough contributors"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"from all like people who--"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"- It's like Wikipedia, sort of?"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"- It's enough that you gotta trust it."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"Sometimes I read something and I'm just like,"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"""Is this just like another 35-year-old white dude"

01:51:58;01:52:00;"Roddy Ricch definitely didn't mean that."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"Just like, ""Dude, you don't (beep) know."""
01:52:02;01:52:03;"But anyway, this says, ""In this line,"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"""the specific box Roddy refers to is ostensibly"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"""the detachable box magazine of a firearm"

01:52:19;01:52:20;"- No, I don't."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"- Anyway, I bet we'll be hearing the box again"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"so we can readdress."
01:52:23;01:52:23;"I like it."
01:52:23;01:52:27;"- We can interrogate verse two next show."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"- Yeah, we can go a little bit deeper."
01:52:28;01:52:31;"I think I'd be remiss to not play a little bit of ""Yummy."""
01:52:31;01:52:32;"'Cause that is the song."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"And people-- - Let's go out strong."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"- And people really got mad at Bieber."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"I think knives are already out for Bieber."
01:52:38;01:52:41;"I think sometimes just like the reception"
01:52:41;01:52:42;"that a song is gonna get."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Sometimes, obviously, the quality of the song"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"and the vibe of the song impacts the reception."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"But I also think sometimes it's just like for an artist,"
01:52:51;01:52:52;"it's like-- - Not your time, dude."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"- It's either your time or it isn't."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"I don't wanna go to the mat saying"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"that I think ""Yummy"" is particularly great,"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"but it's just, I think it was like knives out for Bieber."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"And then he puts out this song with kind of a goofy name,"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"should have been called ""Elated."""
01:53:04;01:53:06;"It should have been called ""Elated,"""

01:53:07;01:53:08;"That would have been a hit."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"And then on top of that, he gets all desperate for number one"
01:53:12;01:53:15;"and he's been posting nonstop, encouraging fans"
01:53:15;01:53:18;"to stream the (beep) out of it, buy it multiple times,"

01:53:30;01:53:31;"- Yeah, so-- - Wait, was he telling fans"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"to like play it on repeat while they sleep"

01:53:35;01:53:37;"And look, that is how a lot of (beep) gets done"
01:53:37;01:53:38;"in the modern pop landscape,"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"but a lot of times it's fan organized."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"Like legendarily-- - Can you imagine caring?"

01:54:47;01:54:49;"- It was a little bit mask off in a bad way."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"Especially 'cause he has his Beliebers,"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"they should be organizing that."

01:58:32;01:58:33;"People just come out and just be like,"
01:58:33;01:58:36;"hey guys, I've got a new song coming out in a week."
01:58:36;01:58:38;"I'm here to tell you that I really want this"
01:58:38;01:58:39;"to go to number one."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"Let me tell you a little bit about it."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"And let me tell you why I believe"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"I deserve to go to number one."
01:58:43;01:58:44;"And I know you haven't heard the song yet,"
01:58:44;01:58:47;"but I have been out here trying to make good music"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"for you for a long time."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"And I think you know that I have your back."
01:58:50;01:58:52;"And here's the thing, it's ""Elated"","
01:58:52;01:58:54;"that you are my lady."
01:58:54;01:58:55;"It's about my wife."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"This is my first single since I got married."
01:58:57;01:59:00;"Understandably, we need this as a couple."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"Anyway, I think also like,"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"I think you can write a love song."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"I think the world accepts love songs"
01:59:06;01:59:07;"when they know who it's about."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"I think if they're just kind of like,"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"you know, Lindsay wrote that about Stevie"
01:59:11;01:59:12;"when things were good between them."
01:59:12;01:59:15;"That's like an interesting little asterisk sometimes"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"where it's like, oh yeah, you know,"
01:59:17;01:59:18;"John wrote that for Yoko"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"or Mariah Carey wrote that for Derek Cheater."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"Whatever it is, people--"
01:59:22;01:59:23;"- That'd be tight."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"- I think people can be like, oh, they're in love."
01:59:25;01:59:26;"I've been in love in my life."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"I'm in love right now."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"Whatever, people relate to it."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"And I think people also, clearly our culture can accept"
01:59:30;01:59:34;"just like the most like lascivious sex songs."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"There's something weird about sex songs"
01:59:35;01:59:38;"that are specifically about one person."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"That's my take."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"- You should never market a sex song"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"that is about one person."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"- Words of wisdom, yeah."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"I'm gonna sign off on that."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"- Although I did always like this big pun song"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"that came out posthumously,"
01:59:49;01:59:50;"but it wasn't really about that,"
01:59:50;01:59:51;"where the chorus went,"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"♪ It's so hard ♪"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"♪ I just wanna (beep) my wife ♪"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"- Wife."

02:00:01;02:00:03;"Wife is kind of like bed sheets."
02:00:03;02:00:04;"It's like that kind of word."
02:00:04;02:00:05;"It's just like--"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"- And cheer in heaven, any wife songs?"
02:00:07;02:00:08;"- Don't put those words in your songs."
02:00:08;02:00:09;"- You know, if there's anybody"
02:00:09;02:00:10;"who could crack the code"
02:00:10;02:00:13;"on how to do a having sex with your wife,"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"unequivocal beloved hit, it's Ed."
02:00:15;02:00:16;"Ed Sheeran."
02:00:16;02:00:18;"- There's a Who song called My Wife,"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"but it's more about the wife being at home,"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"just like, I'm in trouble when I get home, dude."
02:00:23;02:00:24;"She knows I've been out."
02:00:24;02:00:26;"- Oh, that should be called The Wife."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"- My wife."
02:00:27;02:00:31;"- I think Borat just kind of like really ruined--"
02:00:31;02:00:32;"- That's true, the word wife."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"- Really ruined the word wife."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"And then there also became this whole thing"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"in the past couple of years about like wife guys."
02:00:37;02:00:38;"Are you familiar with that, Jake?"
02:00:38;02:00:39;"- No."
02:00:39;02:00:42;"- My vague understanding is that it's like somebody,"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"an active social media person,"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"whether it's on Instagram or Twitter,"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"who's always talking about their wife"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"and just how much they love her and just like,"
02:00:50;02:00:51;"yeah, wait, oh, actually,"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"there's a Wikipedia entry for wife guy."
02:00:53;02:00:54;"- Oh, that rules."
02:00:54;02:00:54;"- That's amazing."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"Actually, Jake, you read it."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"What's a wife guy?"
02:00:57;02:01:00;"- In social media, wife guy's a man whose fame is owed"
02:01:00;02:01:02;"to the content he posts about his wife."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"(laughing)"
02:01:04;02:01:07;"The term was first coined for internet memes about wives,"
02:01:07;02:01:11;"notably a much parodied email to my girlfriend's husband"
02:01:11;02:01:12;"circulating in 2016."
02:01:12;02:01:14;"(laughing)"
02:01:14;02:01:17;"Robbie Tripp, an American whose Instagram posts of himself"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"with his wife went viral in 2017,"
02:01:19;02:01:22;"was dubbed the curvy wife guy by the media,"
02:01:22;02:01:23;"spawning many imitators."
02:01:23;02:01:24;"- Oh yeah, he posted about how much he loved"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"his wife's curvy body."
02:01:26;02:01:29;"- The New York Times compared wife guys to incels"
02:01:29;02:01:32;"who define themselves by their inability to find a partner"
02:01:32;02:01:35;"and that wife guys define themselves by having found one"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"and expect to be congratulated for it."
02:01:37;02:01:39;"- Love that the New York Times is weighing in."
02:01:39;02:01:40;"- I know."
02:01:40;02:01:41;"Also considered the wife guy phenomenon"
02:01:41;02:01:44;"to reflect the changed status of marriage"
02:01:44;02:01:47;"from societal default to personal achievement."
02:01:47;02:01:48;"Achievement?"
02:01:48;02:01:49;"Yikes."
02:01:49;02:01:51;"- Is Justin Bieber a wife guy?"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"It's also like, that's just how,"
02:01:53;02:01:54;"it's just funny how that goes."
02:01:54;02:01:58;"It's like, well, you're either an incel or you're a wife guy."
02:01:58;02:01:59;"(laughing)"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"There's no longer any in between."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"- I mean, this is just so unbelievable"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"what Matt just sent to kind of close out."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"- Wait, is it?"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"- Article from the cut in October."
02:02:08;02:02:09;"- About wife guys?"
02:02:09;02:02:10;"- The cut rules."
02:02:10;02:02:11;"- No, beyond, beyond."
02:02:11;02:02:14;"Entitled, here's the wife guy anthem you didn't need."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"We regret to inform you that Justin Bieber has teamed up"
02:02:16;02:02:19;"with two husbands named Dan and Shay to produce a banger"
02:02:19;02:02:22;"that wife guys everywhere will surely blast."
02:02:22;02:02:24;"And that's 10,000 hours."
02:02:24;02:02:25;"- Oh my God."
02:02:25;02:02:26;"- That's the, oh, I would wait."
02:02:26;02:02:29;"I would spend 10,000 hours with you."
02:02:29;02:02:31;"- That's a wife guy anthem."
02:02:31;02:02:33;"- And remember it was performed at Bieber's wedding?"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"- That song is awful."
02:02:35;02:02:38;"- Okay, so now I understand some of the yummy backlash."
02:02:38;02:02:41;"It's Bieber was hanging out in the country world"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"where it's actually cool to write songs about loving"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"and making love to your wife."
02:02:45;02:02:46;"And he's hanging out with Dan and Shay,"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"who are kind of two YouTubers who went country."
02:02:48;02:02:50;"And he's getting a big hit out of it, actually."
02:02:50;02:02:51;"And so then Bieber's like,"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"well, I gotta get back to making my own music,"
02:02:53;02:02:55;"which is not really country"
02:02:55;02:02:57;"and to me is more R&B-influenced pop."
02:02:57;02:02:59;"And he's kind of like, but based on the time"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"I've been spending with Dan and Shay and all this,"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"I'm realizing that this wife guy (beep)"
02:03:03;02:03:04;"wife guy's the wave."
02:03:04;02:03:06;"And I think if I kind of can bring that more"
02:03:06;02:03:10;"into the R&B space, I think it's gonna catch fire."
02:03:10;02:03:12;"And he didn't realize that you can't really bring"
02:03:12;02:03:13;"that wife guy energy into here."
02:03:13;02:03:16;"Although there was a big R&B hit, was it,"
02:03:16;02:03:19;"can't remember who it was."
02:03:19;02:03:20;"It's a great song."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"It's about what happens before you become a wife guy."
02:03:22;02:03:25;"And I went, ♪ Let's get married ♪"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"♪ We ain't getting no younger ♪"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"And I feel like a song, ""Let's Get Married,"""
