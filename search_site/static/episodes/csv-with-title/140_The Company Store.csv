00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again"
00:02;00:06;"This week's episode will prove to be very inspiring"
00:06;00:13;"We talked about the inspire brands Empire and specifically the new acquisition of Dunkin Donuts"
00:13;00:20;"We also talked about our new mics John Carroll Lynch and the new biggest song in the world drivers license by Olivia"
00:20;00:24;"Rodrigo this is a very special"
00:24;00:28;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:28;00:30;"begin"
00:30;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:38;00:45;"The world I felt, loving me, all my rightful chances"
00:45;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:10;01:14;"He's the only man"
01:14;01:16;"Alright Time Crisis back again"
01:16;01:18;"Getting a little more high tech"
01:18;01:23;"Seemed like 9 months of earbuds was about enough"
01:23;01:25;"Trying some new microphones"
01:25;01:31;"I feel bad admitting it, I more or less had this set up the entire time but you know we had a vibe going"
01:31;01:39;"What do you think about it Jake? You look very pro, you got the craned professional radio vibe pointed right at your face"
01:39;01:42;"Yeah kind of like a jib with a microphone on the end"
01:42;01:47;"Yeah our vibe was like me screaming into a laptop for the last 9 months"
01:47;01:50;"It was our guided by voices alien lanes era"
01:50;01:51;"Yeah"
01:51;01:54;"Lo-fi basement internet radio"
01:54;01:56;"Lot of authenticity, lot of spirit"
01:56;02:03;"It's actually rare, a lot of times a band starts out lo-fi and then they class it up a little bit"
02:03;02:07;"Actually what was the GBV record where they got a little high five like"
02:07;02:11;"Hey hey glad girls, I only wanna get you high"
02:11;02:12;"You know what I'm talking about?"
02:12;02:14;"Yeah of course, that's Isolation Drills"
02:14;02:21;"They did 2 like albums on TVT which was like a sort of major label in the late 90s"
02:21;02:26;"But they did a record called Do The Collapse that was produced by Rick Okasik"
02:26;02:33;"And that was the first like big studio record that was very divisive within the GBV fan community"
02:33;02:39;"Because honestly like some of the songs are great on that record but it doesn't quite have the magic"
02:39;02:46;"It's always a very hard transition, you know at best an artist in that situation will win over new fans"
02:46;02:53;"But you're never gonna please the vast majority when you go clean if you're coming from a lo-fi perspective"
02:53;02:59;"And I think they were trying to like win over new fans and become like a bigger band"
02:59;03:02;"It just wasn't in the cards for whatever reason, timing"
03:02;03:07;"I mean that was right at the point that like nu metal and like rap rock was like really taking off"
03:07;03:13;"So like this sort of like 60s influence like sensitive like great songwriting"
03:13;03:17;"By a bunch of like guys in their 40s wasn't gonna hit big"
03:17;03:20;"They ended up in a classic like neither here nor there spot"
03:20;03:23;"Although I always remember that Hey Hey Glad Girls song"
03:23;03:26;"Because it is just an unequivocally great well-written song"
03:26;03:31;"But maybe at that moment the old school lo-fi heads were like this is too clean"
03:31;03:35;"And yet they didn't push quite far enough to get into the zeitgeist"
03:35;03:38;"They didn't add a DJ, they didn't start rapping"
03:38;03:40;"Record scratches"
03:40;03:44;"Yeah, they didn't quite make it into like the new rock paradigm"
03:44;03:46;"So then they were kind of just adrift"
03:46;03:47;"Yeah"
03:47;03:49;"Hey Hey Glad Girls"
03:49;03:53;"Only wanna get you high"
03:53;03:56;"Hey Hey Glad Girls"
03:56;04:00;"Only wanna get you high"
04:00;04:04;"Hey Hey Glad Girls"
04:04;04:08;"Only wanna get you high"
04:08;04:12;"And they're alright"
04:12;04:14;"And they're alright"
04:16;04:18;"And they're alright Glad Girls"
04:18;04:21;"But anyway in the time crisis universe"
04:21;04:23;"We actually after the first three or four years"
04:23;04:25;"We were getting a little bit too popular"
04:25;04:28;"Like jocks started showing up at our shows"
04:28;04:32;"The community was starting to be like man this is not what I signed up for"
04:32;04:34;"You know some people who weren't there for the good vibes"
04:34;04:38;"Started just showing up in the lot just to get f***ed up"
04:38;04:42;"So we actually did the opposite we went lo-fi"
04:42;04:44;"Just to weed out the fairweather fans"
04:44;04:45;"Back to basics"
04:45;04:47;"Yeah back to the basement"
04:47;04:48;"Exactly"
04:48;04:50;"Where we didn't start"
04:50;04:52;"Right"
04:52;04:58;"Well you know in the early days when we were just a garage internet radio show"
04:58;05:00;"We didn't you know nobody actually heard those"
05:00;05:02;"Because there was nowhere for them to go"
05:02;05:04;"But you know we were straight in the basement"
05:04;05:07;"All the 90s shows that we taped that never aired"
05:07;05:12;"What was the joke we had Bob Weir on that it was like"
05:12;05:17;"The first time a member of the Grateful Dead had been on time crisis since the early 90s"
05:17;05:19;"Since we had Jerry Garcia on"
05:19;05:21;"Back in like '93"
05:21;05:23;"It's been way too long"
05:23;05:26;"Jake you know this microphone"
05:26;05:29;"I think we all have Shure 7B's"
05:29;05:30;"Is that what they are?"
05:30;05:31;"Yeah"
05:31;05:32;"SM7B"
05:32;05:34;"It's looking and sounding great"
05:34;05:38;"So I believe this mic which you know you see them in studios"
05:38;05:40;"But also a lot of people use them for vocal stuff"
05:40;05:46;"But this mic famously was a go to on the classic Michael Jackson records"
05:46;05:47;"Oh really?"
05:47;05:51;"The Shure SM7B was used on Thriller"
05:51;05:52;"Wow"
05:52;05:54;"Was that like cutting edge at the time?"
05:54;05:56;"Yeah I mean I guess to be fair"
05:56;06:00;"We might have like some like gear heads listening that take some issue"
06:00;06:02;"It was the SM7"
06:02;06:04;"Which I think is more or less the same mic"
06:04;06:06;"It was called the SM7 at the time"
06:06;06:09;"And here's what Bruce Swedeen RIP"
06:09;06:11;"He actually died last year"
06:11;06:15;"Bruce was Quincy Jones' engineer"
06:15;06:18;"So like a very integral part of the team"
06:18;06:21;"I guess in his track by track memoir"
06:21;06:22;"In the studio with Michael Jackson"
06:22;06:26;"He said one of my absolute favorite microphones is the Shure SM7"
06:26;06:29;"I recorded most of the big hit records of Michael's career with him"
06:29;06:31;"In front of one of my SM7's"
06:31;06:33;"I've been pretty vocal about how much I love that microphone"
06:33;06:35;"It's a great mic"
06:35;06:37;"That's a pretty funny turn of phrase"
06:37;06:40;"I've been pretty vocal about how much I love that microphone"
06:40;06:42;"Oh he knew what he was doing with that one"
06:42;06:43;"Well anyway"
06:43;06:47;"Thriller is the best selling American album of all time"
06:47;06:50;"Because Eagles Greatest Hits Part 1 is not an album"
06:50;06:52;"That's a best selling disc"
06:52;06:53;"But it's not an album"
06:53;06:54;"It's a compilation"
06:54;06:55;"You know"
06:55;06:57;"What was I listening to recently?"
06:57;07:00;"And maybe this was in the Eagles doc too but"
07:00;07:02;"They used very specific language"
07:02;07:05;"That the Eagles were the greatest selling artist of the 20th century"
07:05;07:07;"Which made me think that maybe"
07:07;07:12;"Sales of the Greatest Hits comp have slackened a bit in the 21st century"
07:12;07:16;"And maybe like Thriller has been a little more steady"
07:16;07:17;"I'm not really sure"
07:17;07:19;"Because it used to be like unequivocally"
07:19;07:22;"The Eagles Greatest Hits Volume 1 was the greatest selling"
07:22;07:25;"Yeah disc, album, whatever you want to call it"
07:25;07:29;"But now it's been relegated to the greatest selling artist of the 20th century"
07:29;07:33;"Or maybe not artist but greatest selling collection"
07:33;07:36;"I still find it hard to believe that that's even true"
07:36;07:39;"I know this has come up before in the show that the Eagles are the greatest selling"
07:39;07:40;"I know"
07:40;07:42;"I think part of it is that"
07:42;07:47;"Records didn't become like crazy blockbusters until like the 70s"
07:47;07:50;"And then the 80s took it to another level"
07:50;07:53;"So you know because even when you see these like big hit records"
07:53;07:55;"From the 50s and 60s or even the 40s"
07:55;07:58;"And people talk about like White Christmas selling so much"
07:58;07:59;"Or a Frank Sinatra record"
07:59;08:03;"They weren't putting up the blockbuster numbers that you see today"
08:03;08:06;"Partially because there were less people around"
08:06;08:09;"70 years ago it was probably like half the population"
08:09;08:10;"Oh yeah definitely"
08:10;08:14;"And I also feel like the infrastructure for like"
08:14;08:17;"You know there weren't like giant record store chains"
08:17;08:19;"That like that really took hold in the 80s and 90s"
08:19;08:21;"So you know I'm just like picturing"
08:21;08:23;"You know it's like we've talked about this on the show"
08:23;08:25;"Back when there were like local hits"
08:25;08:27;"That was just like oh man yeah"
08:27;08:30;"In Cleveland you couldn't stop hearing that Rush track"
08:30;08:31;"Yeah"
08:31;08:33;"Oh man still when we come through town"
08:33;08:34;"And we bust that one out"
08:34;08:36;"That song was a flop everywhere"
08:36;08:38;"But it was actually like a hit there"
08:38;08:39;"Oh yeah I think that's"
08:39;08:40;"One DJ really believed in us"
08:40;08:43;"I think that's literally in that Rush documentary"
08:43;08:44;"That they got traction"
08:44;08:45;"In the Midwest"
08:45;08:47;"Yeah is it like Working Man"
08:47;08:49;"Like what was their first hit"
08:49;08:50;"Yeah actually Seinfeld"
08:50;08:51;"Can we get a number crunch"
08:51;08:52;"What was Rush's first hit"
08:52;08:54;"And I think actually they have a talking head in the documentary"
08:54;08:56;"Who's like you know what"
08:56;08:57;"Out here in the Midwest"
08:57;08:58;"Kind of like Rust Belt"
08:58;09:00;"That really connected with people"
09:00;09:01;"Yeah"
09:01;09:02;"I mean maybe it's true"
09:02;09:04;"It's really hard to imagine that today"
09:04;09:06;"Obviously like hits don't even start"
09:06;09:08;"At like a local radio station"
09:08;09:09;"In quite the same way"
09:09;09:10;"But just that idea of being like"
09:10;09:11;"You know what"
09:11;09:13;"The disc jockeys in New York and LA"
09:13;09:15;"They didn't understand man"
09:15;09:17;"But like out here"
09:17;09:19;"Really connected"
09:19;09:21;"Toledo, Ohio really went to bat for"
09:21;09:23;"Rush Working Man"
09:23;09:25;"Working Man is"
09:25;09:29;"Is a single from Rush's first album"
09:29;09:31;"I don't know if it's their"
09:31;09:32;"Biggest hit"
09:32;09:33;"It looks like"
09:33;09:34;"In the mood"
09:34;09:36;"Not their biggest hit"
09:36;09:37;"No their first hit"
09:37;09:38;"Their first hit"
09:38;09:39;"Uh"
09:39;09:40;"Jesus"
09:40;09:45;"The show is Seinfeld"
09:45;09:47;"Researching early Rush hits"
09:47;09:50;"The mic quality is improved but"
09:50;09:52;"The pace of the show"
09:52;09:54;"The content is"
09:54;09:56;"Continuing to slide downhill"
09:56;09:58;"Alright well"
09:58;10:00;"I mean I could tell you their"
10:00;10:02;"Biggest hits of all time"
10:02;10:03;"Okay now that's cool"
10:03;10:04;"Now you know what"
10:04;10:05;"You're from Montreal"
10:05;10:07;"You don't understand"
10:07;10:09;"Even though Rush is Canadian"
10:09;10:10;"You're like one of these"
10:10;10:12;"Pretentious Montrealers"
10:12;10:13;"When Rush first came out"
10:13;10:15;"And you didn't get it"
10:15;10:16;"And you sh*t on them"
10:16;10:18;"And they had to come to the American Midwest"
10:18;10:20;"To get some respect from the Working Men"
10:20;10:22;"Look here's what I'll tell you"
10:22;10:24;"Working Man is not"
10:24;10:26;"One of their top ten"
10:26;10:28;"Biggest songs of all time"
10:28;10:30;"Does that do anything for you?"
10:30;10:32;"But it's top ten in Ohio"
10:32;10:33;"And that's what matters"
10:33;10:35;"Locking up"
10:35;10:36;"At seven yeah"
10:36;10:39;"And I'll go to work at nine"
10:39;10:42;"I got no time for living"
10:42;10:45;"Yes I'm working all the time"
10:45;10:47;"It seems to me"
10:47;10:49;"I could live my life"
10:49;10:52;"A lot better than I think I am"
10:52;10:55;"I guess that's why they call me"
10:55;10:58;"They call me the Working Man"
10:58;11:00;"Well Andy going back to my original point"
11:00;11:02;"Is that I think"
11:02;11:03;"That the Eagles"
11:03;11:05;"Obviously they're a great band"
11:05;11:07;"Obviously they wrote a lot of great songs"
11:07;11:09;"They had a high degree of professionalism"
11:09;11:11;"Hardcore leadership"
11:11;11:13;"In the team of Henley and Fry"
11:13;11:15;"Those guys weren't taking any sh*t"
11:15;11:17;"They knew how to steer the ship"
11:17;11:18;"So not only did they have all that"
11:18;11:20;"I think they hit it big"
11:20;11:21;"At the perfect moment"
11:21;11:22;"The 70s"
11:22;11:23;"When you have like these"
11:23;11:25;"New school record executives"
11:25;11:26;"The David Geffens"
11:26;11:28;"Thinking big"
11:28;11:30;"Musics taking even more of a stronghold"
11:30;11:32;"Over commerce and the youth"
11:32;11:34;"So I think they did something"
11:34;11:36;"That even Frank Sinatra couldn't have done"
11:36;11:39;"When he was the ultimate idol in the 50s"
11:39;11:42;"Or even the 40s through the 60s or whatever"
11:42;11:43;"In the 70s"
11:43;11:45;"They were like the band"
11:45;11:46;"Perfect band for that moment"
11:46;11:48;"And I think it pushed them so far ahead"
11:48;11:49;"In terms of sales"
11:49;11:50;"Yeah"
11:50;11:51;"I could imagine in the 80s"
11:51;11:53;"They stopped being a band"
11:53;11:54;"You get some really big records"
11:54;11:56;"From Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna"
11:56;11:58;"And actually their record is getting"
11:58;11:59;"A little bit shakier"
11:59;12:02;"And maybe by the time you get to the 2000s"
12:02;12:04;"They've been outpaced or something"
12:04;12:06;"But because they were that first band in the 70s"
12:06;12:07;"They got like a"
12:07;12:09;"They kind of got there first"
12:09;12:10;"That's my guess"
12:10;12:11;"Y'all"
12:11;12:12;"I got it"
12:12;12:14;"I got the number crunch"
12:14;12:16;"The group released its first album"
12:16;12:18;"This is from Rush's website"
12:18;12:20;"Released its first album Rush in 1974"
12:20;12:22;"The album wasn't faring too well"
12:22;12:24;"Until a Cleveland radio station"
12:24;12:25;"WMMS"
12:25;12:27;"Added the song Working Man"
12:27;12:28;"To its playlist"
12:28;12:30;"The album was then picked up by Mercury Records"
12:30;12:32;"In the US"
12:32;12:34;"And sales began to skyrocket"
12:34;12:35;"Thank you Seinfeld"
12:35;12:36;"You got there"
12:36;12:37;"We appreciate it"
12:37;12:38;"So there you go"
12:38;12:39;"Right there"
12:39;12:40;"Is the story of"
12:40;12:41;"One of the great"
12:41;12:44;"Three piece prog rock bands of all time"
12:44;12:46;"They've put out I think like 40 albums"
12:46;12:48;"Incredibly iconic group"
12:48;12:50;"And it's very possible"
12:50;12:52;"They could have gone back to Canada"
12:52;12:53;"Wait what?"
12:53;12:55;"Are they from Toronto?"
12:55;12:56;"They are"
12:56;12:57;"Okay so yeah who knows"
12:57;12:58;"They could have gone back to Canada"
12:58;13:00;"Those guys would have been"
13:00;13:01;"You know cleaning up"
13:01;13:04;"Poutine off the floor after a Maple Leafs game"
13:04;13:07;"Working at the fishery"
13:07;13:08;"It could have been really bad"
13:08;13:09;"But"
13:09;13:11;"It was one DJ in Cleveland"
13:11;13:12;"And more importantly"
13:12;13:14;"The working men and women"
13:14;13:15;"Of the Cleveland area"
13:15;13:17;"Who connected with their song Working Man"
13:17;13:19;"And that's what put them"
13:19;13:20;"Back on the path to glory"
13:20;13:22;"They could have been slinging Beaver Tails"
13:22;13:24;"Do you guys know about Beaver Tails?"
13:24;13:26;"The Canadian pastry?"
13:26;13:27;"No"
13:27;13:29;"Beaver Tails is"
13:29;13:31;"I haven't thought about this"
13:31;13:32;"In a long time but"
13:32;13:34;"Beaver Tails is like a"
13:34;13:36;"It's almost like a flat sugar coated"
13:36;13:38;"Fried donut type of thing"
13:38;13:39;"It's like a"
13:39;13:41;"A very Canadian thing"
13:41;13:43;"I've never been offered one"
13:43;13:45;"All the times I've been in Canada"
13:45;13:46;"It's a gross name"
13:46;13:52;"Geddy Lee's Slang and Beaver Tails"
13:52;13:54;"That was actually Rush's fourth album"
13:54;13:58;"Slang and Beaver Tails"
13:58;14:00;"But anyway it is pretty wild"
14:00;14:02;"How like one small place could have done it"
14:02;14:04;"I mean obviously you still have stories today I guess"
14:04;14:05;"About like"
14:05;14:06;"Hey Nick someone's eating"
14:06;14:08;"Nick you gotta mute it"
14:08;14:09;"Getting some serious"
14:09;14:11;"Nick's just whaling on a bowl of pasta"
14:11;14:13;"Whaling some Beaver Tails over there"
14:13;14:16;"All that Beaver Tail talk guys"
14:16;14:18;"It got me hungry"
14:18;14:19;"Wait"
14:19;14:20;"Babe"
14:20;14:22;"Do we have any Beaver Tails?"
14:22;14:24;"Oh we actually do"
14:24;14:26;"Heat one up for me"
14:26;14:27;"Thank you"
14:27;14:29;"Beaver Tails is like a specialty thing"
14:29;14:31;"We're not just like cooking Beaver Tails"
14:31;14:33;"We don't have like a pantry full of Beaver Tails"
14:33;14:35;"Fresh from the bakery"
14:35;14:36;"Speaking of food in the house"
14:36;14:38;"I feel like I have a major disclosure to make"
14:38;14:40;"To the TC community"
14:40;14:41;"Oh no"
14:41;14:43;"I went to Best Buy today"
14:43;14:45;"And I picked up"
14:45;14:47;"A second freezer"
14:47;14:51;"We are not a two fridge household"
14:51;14:52;"But we are a"
14:52;14:55;"We have two separate refrigeration units"
14:55;14:57;"This is a small"
14:57;15:00;"Three foot by two foot by three foot"
15:00;15:02;"Whatever the cubic feet on that is"
15:02;15:03;"I don't remember"
15:03;15:05;"We have a separate freezer to keep in the garage"
15:05;15:07;"Because our freezer has just been"
15:07;15:08;"Especially in the COVID era"
15:08;15:09;"On the fritz?"
15:09;15:10;"Packed"
15:10;15:12;"It's always just packed"
15:12;15:13;"Prepper"
15:13;15:14;"Sort of a prepper mentality"
15:14;15:16;"No it's just like"
15:16;15:18;"A lot of like frozen tortellinis"
15:18;15:20;"We bought a bunch of"
15:20;15:22;"Bagels from H&H Bagels"
15:22;15:23;"Oh shipped from New York?"
15:23;15:25;"Yep keep those frozen"
15:25;15:27;"I don't know we have kind of a small freezer to begin with"
15:27;15:29;"And it's always just packed to the gills"
15:29;15:31;"Wait but it's not a chest freezer?"
15:31;15:33;"It looks like a mini fridge"
15:33;15:35;"But it's a freezer"
15:35;15:37;"It's just a stand alone freezer unit"
15:37;15:39;"Yep not a full chest"
15:39;15:41;"Couldn't put a human body in there"
15:41;15:43;"If you don't mind me asking Jake"
15:43;15:44;"How much does that run you?"
15:44;15:46;"Ran me $135"
15:46;15:48;"Oh that's better than I thought"
15:48;15:49;"Yep"
15:49;15:50;"And did you think about going bigger?"
15:50;15:52;"Or this is the appropriate size?"
15:52;15:53;"This is going to be fine"
15:53;15:56;"This is like more than doubles our freezer situation"
15:56;15:58;"So we'll be good"
15:58;16:00;"Did you think at all about just going for a full fridge?"
16:00;16:03;"Because maybe you could stock the fridge part with soda"
16:03;16:05;"So much soda"
16:05;16:08;"Wouldn't it feel good post-COVID"
16:08;16:10;"Having people over for the first time"
16:10;16:13;"And you know the freezer"
16:13;16:15;"There's very little reason that they would go to the freezer"
16:15;16:17;"But if you had that second fridge"
16:17;16:18;"In the garage"
16:18;16:20;"You would just feel real proud"
16:20;16:21;"Just to say"
16:21;16:23;"And hey there's a lot of soda in the garage"
16:23;16:25;"Go ahead and grab yourself a root beer, a grape soda"
16:25;16:26;"Something like that"
16:26;16:29;"The top shelf is stacked with all"
16:29;16:32;"Shasta brand soda"
16:32;16:35;"The second shelf is on the Delos"
16:35;16:37;"Ooh"
16:37;16:39;"It's a strong look but"
16:39;16:40;"Don't need it"
16:40;16:43;"Don't need the full size fridge in the garage"
16:43;16:45;"Which is also pretty tiny"
16:45;16:48;"But I feel like this was a big milestone"
16:48;16:50;"I was thinking about the TC crew today"
16:50;16:53;"Sitting in that curbside pickup"
16:53;16:55;"At the Best Buy in Atwater"
16:55;16:57;"I mean did you think about Lonnie's dad?"
16:57;16:58;"Of course"
16:58;17:00;"Was it like emotional at all?"
17:00;17:01;"To find, you know"
17:01;17:03;"You had this figure"
17:03;17:05;"Going back to your teen years"
17:05;17:06;"Clearly he's loomed so large"
17:06;17:08;"And even if he didn't loom that large"
17:08;17:11;"He's become larger than life for the listeners"
17:11;17:14;"Easily a top 5 TC story moment"
17:14;17:16;"I would probably just go ahead and put it at number 1"
17:16;17:19;"He's like the Bigfoot of TC"
17:19;17:20;"Yeah"
17:20;17:22;"So was there anything like emotional"
17:22;17:23;"Or just like circle of life"
17:23;17:24;"About being like"
17:24;17:26;"I'm a homeowner"
17:26;17:27;"I'm in my 40s"
17:27;17:28;"I'm an adult"
17:28;17:30;"I'm about to be a dad"
17:30;17:31;"That's true"
17:31;17:32;"I'm about to be a dad"
17:32;17:33;"With a freezer in the garage"
17:33;17:34;"I mean were these"
17:34;17:35;"The kind of thoughts coming up?"
17:35;17:37;"You know that Joni Mitchell song"
17:37;17:38;"Circle song?"
17:38;17:39;"Yeah"
17:39;17:40;"Or there's like a lot of songs"
17:40;17:41;"About this sort of thing"
17:41;17:43;"Like the cycle of life"
17:43;17:44;"This should be a Mountain Brew song"
17:44;17:46;"The third verse is about"
17:46;17:47;"You know I'm getting to that point"
17:47;17:49;"I need that second fridge"
17:49;17:51;"That is a big milestone"
17:51;17:53;"Yeah Hannah had suggested it"
17:53;17:54;"And I was like"
17:54;17:55;"You know what that's a great idea"
17:55;17:57;"And then I just very self consciously made"
17:57;17:59;"The corniest joke ever"
17:59;18:00;"This is all of her text"
18:00;18:01;"I was sort of like"
18:01;18:02;"We can get it"
18:02;18:04;"But only if we stock it with McRibs"
18:04;18:06;"You had to"
18:06;18:08;"And I think Hannah's like"
18:08;18:09;"What the f*** does that mean?"
18:09;18:10;"You're like"
18:10;18:11;"Like Lonnie's dad"
18:11;18:12;"And she's just like"
18:12;18:13;"Who?"
18:13;18:14;"You know from Time Crisis"
18:14;18:16;"Oh that thing you do every two weeks"
18:16;18:18;"There's a shade of truth to that"
18:18;18:20;"I think she had like"
18:20;18:21;"In her head"
18:21;18:22;"Done the math"
18:22;18:24;"And kind of figured I was making a TC reference"
18:24;18:26;"I think it was a little hazy"
18:26;18:27;"Right"
18:27;18:28;"McRib joke"
18:28;18:31;"Even if you only have a cursory familiarity"
18:31;18:33;"With the TC you"
18:33;18:34;"That's enough"
18:34;18:36;"If I had made a Lonnie's dad reference"
18:36;18:37;"That would have gone"
18:37;18:39;"That would have been very confusing"
18:39;18:40;"That would have gone right over her head"
18:40;18:41;"Old dead air"
18:41;18:42;"Yeah"
18:42;18:43;"Wait so is there anything in it right now?"
18:43;18:44;"No"
18:44;18:45;"Just got home"
18:45;18:48;"Unloaded the freezer from the back of the van"
18:48;18:49;"It's sitting in the garage"
18:49;18:51;"I'll plug it in tomorrow"
18:51;18:52;"Feeling great about it"
18:52;18:55;"That might be worth throwing on Instagram live"
18:55;18:56;"I don't know if you're going to do that"
18:56;18:57;"Oh hey guys"
18:57;18:59;"Hey what's up guys"
18:59;19:00;"Jake here"
19:00;19:02;"Just going to stock the fridge"
19:02;19:04;"Little preview of Sunday's show"
19:04;19:05;"No spoilers but"
19:05;19:06;"Here I am"
19:06;19:08;"I'm stocking the new freezer"
19:08;19:10;"I mean there literally are"
19:10;19:11;"YouTube videos like that"
19:11;19:12;"That just be like"
19:12;19:15;"Episode 1057"
19:15;19:17;"Jake sets up the new freezer"
19:17;19:18;"What's up guys"
19:18;19:19;"Well you probably would have filmed the whole thing"
19:19;19:20;"What's up guys"
19:20;19:22;"I'm here about to pick up the new freezer"
19:22;19:24;"I'm at Best Buy"
19:24;19:26;"Just kind of hanging out"
19:26;19:27;"And then eventually just plug it in"
19:27;19:28;"Be like alright"
19:28;19:30;"I just feel getting cold already"
19:30;19:32;"Break down the model and sh*t"
19:32;19:33;"There's so much stuff like that"
19:33;19:34;"And it's"
19:34;19:35;"Not all of it's even like"
19:35;19:37;"Personality based"
19:37;19:38;"It sometimes is like"
19:38;19:40;"Just deeply factual"
19:40;19:42;"That stuff is so weird"
19:42;19:44;"How often do you see yourself using"
19:44;19:46;"You know making the trip to"
19:46;19:48;"The second freezer"
19:48;19:49;"That's a good question"
19:49;19:51;"It's a great question Nick"
19:51;19:52;"Also how do you get to your"
19:52;19:53;"I can't quite picture it"
19:53;19:55;"Your garage you got to like"
19:55;19:57;"Walk across your backyard"
19:57;19:58;"Yeah it's not"
19:58;19:59;"It's not connected to the house"
19:59;20:00;"It's not like suburban home"
20:00;20:01;"Like door right in"
20:01;20:03;"No"
20:03;20:04;"It's like"
20:04;20:05;"Yeah maybe 20 feet"
20:05;20:06;"25 feet"
20:06;20:07;"From the back door"
20:07;20:08;"To the garage door"
20:08;20:10;"Right so on a cold winter night"
20:10;20:14;"Maybe got to throw on a jacket"
20:14;20:15;"Life's hard"
20:15;20:16;"Yep"
20:16;20:18;"I think it will be used as like"
20:18;20:20;"Auxiliary storage facility"
20:20;20:21;"I think"
20:21;20:22;"Most stuff that I'm going to"
20:22;20:24;"Be consuming immediately"
20:24;20:25;"Will come out of"
20:25;20:27;"The freezer that's in the kitchen"
20:27;20:28;"But then"
20:28;20:29;"Everything else"
20:29;20:30;"The extras"
20:30;20:32;"You know if you buy"
20:32;20:34;"24 bagels from H&H"
20:34;20:36;"18 of those"
20:36;20:37;"You're cut"
20:37;20:38;"Like you're cutting"
20:38;20:40;"And then you're freezing in ziplock bags"
20:40;20:41;"They're sitting in the freezer"
20:41;20:42;"In the garage"
20:42;20:43;"Sometimes I'll make pizza dough"
20:43;20:44;"And when I do that"
20:44;20:47;"I'll make 4 separate pizza doughs"
20:47;20:48;"3 of those"
20:48;20:49;"Go into the chest freezer"
20:49;20:50;"Or excuse me"
20:50;20:51;"The external freezer"
20:51;20:53;"Not the chest freezer"
20:53;20:56;"This is so dumb"
20:56;20:58;"This is pretty dry"
20:58;20:59;"This is"
20:59;21:01;"Just like"
21:01;21:03;"Just driving through"
21:03;21:05;"Just on a road trip"
21:05;21:06;"Driving through some"
21:06;21:07;"Like small town"
21:07;21:08;"Just like flip on the radio stage"
21:08;21:09;"Just be like"
21:09;21:10;"So what do you think"
21:10;21:11;"You're going to use that"
21:11;21:13;"That second freezer for?"
21:13;21:14;"Well"
21:14;21:16;"I mean if I had to guess"
21:16;21:18;"Extra pizza dough"
21:18;21:19;"Okay"
21:19;21:20;"Alright"
21:20;21:21;"I got about 80 pounds of venison"
21:21;21:23;"I need to store"
21:23;21:27;"That is the type of stuff"
21:27;21:29;"That people freeze long term"
21:29;21:30;"It's taking me back"
21:30;21:33;"Actually to the early days of COVID"
21:33;21:35;"That like slight fear of like"
21:35;21:36;"Oh wait"
21:36;21:37;"Do we need to like"
21:37;21:39;"Pack the freezer"
21:39;21:41;"Buy like giant things of like"
21:41;21:43;"Frozen vegetables"
21:43;21:45;"And meat and stuff"
21:45;21:46;"Is it possible"
21:46;21:47;"We might be like"
21:47;21:49;"On like deep lockdown"
21:49;21:50;"For two months"
21:50;21:51;"Gotta be like"
21:51;21:53;"Defrosting"
21:53;21:54;"Like man I can't believe"
21:54;21:55;"We're defrosting"
21:55;21:57;"Like the fourth lasagna"
21:57;21:59;"I never thought it would get this bad"
21:59;22:01;"Yesterday"
22:01;22:07;"A child came out to wonder"
22:07;22:16;"Caught a dragonfly inside a jar"
22:16;22:23;"Fearful when the sky was full of thunder"
22:23;22:32;"And tearful at the falling of a star"
22:32;22:34;"And the seasons"
22:34;22:36;"They go round and round"
22:36;22:38;"And the painted ponies"
22:38;22:41;"Go up and down"
22:41;22:49;"We're captive on a carousel of time"
22:49;22:50;"We can't return"
22:50;22:52;"We can only look"
22:52;22:56;"Behind from where we came"
22:56;22:59;"And go round and round and round"
22:59;23:03;"In a circle here"
23:03;23:04;"You know it's funny"
23:04;23:06;"I also made a purchase recently"
23:06;23:08;"Took me a while to actually get it"
23:08;23:10;"And I didn't even bring this down"
23:10;23:11;"To share with the TC community"
23:11;23:13;"I just happened to have it"
23:13;23:14;"On my desk"
23:14;23:15;"Because I thought I might"
23:15;23:16;"Read it this morning"
23:16;23:17;"But I ended up getting caught up"
23:17;23:18;"In other stuff"
23:18;23:19;"But check it out"
23:19;23:20;"Look what I got"
23:20;23:21;"Around the Corner"
23:21;23:23;"Around the World"
23:23;23:24;"I mean it looks like a"
23:24;23:26;"Book about Dunkin Donuts"
23:26;23:27;"The Dunkin Donuts story"
23:27;23:28;"Yeah it's Around the Corner 2"
23:28;23:29;"Around the World"
23:29;23:30;"A Dozen Lessons I Learned"
23:30;23:32;"Running Dunkin Donuts"
23:32;23:34;"By Robert Rosenberg"
23:34;23:37;"35 year CEO of Dunkin Donuts"
23:37;23:39;"I haven't really cracked it yet"
23:39;23:40;"I was kind of like looking at"
23:40;23:41;"Some of the, you know"
23:41;23:43;"On the jacket"
23:43;23:44;"This is what it says"
23:44;23:46;"On the inner jacket"
23:46;23:48;"Grab a cup of your favorite coffee"
23:48;23:49;"And learn about the remarkable story"
23:49;23:51;"About the rise of an iconic brand"
23:51;23:53;"For entrepreneurs fighting for survival"
23:53;23:55;"And leaders in growing businesses"
23:55;23:57;"Facing critical strategic decisions"
23:57;23:58;"I relate to this"
23:58;24:00;"Competition is always fierce"
24:00;24:01;"And the future is never certain"
24:01;24:03;"Throughout all the chaos and the noise"
24:03;24:05;"You need a mentor that has seen"
24:05;24:06;"A business through the ins and outs"
24:06;24:07;"And can offer guidance"
24:07;24:09;"That will exponentially tip the odds"
24:09;24:10;"In your favor to succeed"
24:10;24:12;"Robert Rosenberg took over"
24:12;24:14;"As CEO of Dunkin Donuts in 1963"
24:14;24:15;"Wow"
24:15;24:17;"13 years after the first restaurant"
24:17;24:19;"Was founded by his father William"
24:19;24:21;"In his unprecedented 35 year run"
24:21;24:22;"He grew the company from"
24:22;24:24;"10 million dollars in sales"
24:24;24:26;"To over 2 billion"
24:26;24:28;"With more than 3,000 outlets"
24:28;24:29;"Pretty crazy"
24:29;24:30;"I'm excited for this"
24:30;24:32;"I was thinking it would be fun"
24:32;24:33;"If you learned a lot of lessons from that"
24:33;24:35;"For how you want to run this show"
24:35;24:36;"Maybe I will"
24:36;24:38;"I'm going to try to implement some of this sh*t"
24:38;24:39;"I feel like we were talking about Dunkin"
24:39;24:41;"On the text thread recently"
24:41;24:43;"Dunkin is owned by someone else"
24:43;24:44;"At this point"
24:44;24:45;"There's some like"
24:45;24:47;"Conglomerate of brands"
24:47;24:49;"That was started like 2 years ago"
24:49;24:51;"That owns Dunkin"
24:51;24:52;"Because I remember being like"
24:52;24:54;"Oh Dunkin's valued at like 11 billion"
24:54;24:56;"But like Kind is"
24:56;24:58;"Valued at 5 billion"
24:58;25:00;"Like it just made no sense"
25:00;25:02;"I think you're talking about Inspire Brands"
25:02;25:04;"Inspire Brands"
25:04;25:06;"Inspire Brands which announced"
25:06;25:08;"In 2020"
25:08;25:09;"October of 2020"
25:09;25:11;"That it was buying Dunkin Brands"
25:11;25:13;"For 11.3 billion"
25:13;25:15;"And the deal was completed"
25:15;25:16;"In December"
25:16;25:18;"So this is pretty fresh news"
25:18;25:20;"And then Jake"
25:20;25:21;"I'm just reading the text now"
25:21;25:23;"You said Dunkin only worth"
25:23;25:25;"11 billion and Kind worth 5"
25:25;25:27;"Makes no sense"
25:27;25:28;"There's something crazy going here"
25:28;25:30;"I mean I think it's possible"
25:30;25:31;"I don't know how they would do this"
25:31;25:33;"Because this doesn't seem like a stock market thing"
25:33;25:35;"But you know"
25:35;25:36;"It's actually been in the news a lot"
25:36;25:38;"These Wall Street Bets guys"
25:38;25:41;"They've been pumping up the stocks like GameStop"
25:41;25:43;"Maybe on some deeper level"
25:43;25:45;"There's something like that happening with Kind"
25:45;25:47;"Because yeah I agree"
25:47;25:50;"It seems wildly overvalued"
25:50;25:52;"Just for context"
25:52;25:54;"Inspire Brands Inc"
25:54;25:56;"Formerly Arby's Restaurant Group"
25:56;25:58;"Right"
25:58;26:00;"Owns Baskin Robbins"
26:00;26:01;"Buffalo Wild Wings"
26:01;26:02;"Jimmy John's"
26:02;26:03;"Mr. Donut"
26:03;26:04;"Sonic"
26:04;26:06;"And now Dunkin"
26:06;26:08;"That is a hell of a portfolio"
26:08;26:10;"Not a dud in there"
26:10;26:12;"I did actually skip over"
26:12;26:14;"Rusty Taco"
26:14;26:18;"I did give you the greatest hits"
26:18;26:20;"They also own Rusty Taco"
26:20;26:22;"Rusty Taco?"
26:22;26:24;"Yeah Rusty Taco"
26:24;26:28;"Dallas, Texas based taco chain"
26:28;26:30;"Founded in 2010"
26:30;26:32;"Not familiar"
26:32;26:35;"It'll be interesting to see if now that Dunkin is part of the Inspire Brands family"
26:35;26:38;"If we're going to see more social media interaction"
26:38;26:40;"Between a Dunkin and an Arby's"
26:40;26:42;"You know if maybe there's going to be"
26:42;26:44;"I wonder if there's some time"
26:44;26:46;"Well first of all"
26:46;26:47;"You can totally picture it"
26:47;26:49;"Make it an Inspire Brands kind of day"
26:49;26:51;"Start your day at Dunkin"
26:51;26:52;"Lunch at Arby's"
26:52;26:54;"And then after dinner"
26:54;26:56;"Take the kids for dessert to Baskin Robbins"
26:56;26:58;"I'm sure that's actually happened"
26:58;26:59;"I mean at the Bar-"
26:59;27:01;"Because you said they own Buffalo Wild Wings too?"
27:01;27:02;"Yes"
27:02;27:03;"There's totally somebody"
27:03;27:05;"Especially like in Massachusetts maybe"
27:05;27:07;"Obviously you hit Dunkin for breakfast"
27:07;27:08;"Obviously"
27:08;27:09;"Arby's for lunch"
27:09;27:10;"And then"
27:10;27:13;"Go catch the Pats game"
27:13;27:15;"At Buffalo Wild Wings"
27:15;27:17;"That's actually not that crazy"
27:17;27:19;"No there's thousands of people"
27:19;27:21;"Who have unintentionally"
27:21;27:23;"Made a full Inspire Brands day"
27:23;27:24;"You're an Inspire Head"
27:24;27:26;"And you didn't even know it"
27:26;27:28;"That also sounds like some"
27:28;27:30;"Dark corporate initiative"
27:30;27:32;"Where somebody's just like"
27:32;27:33;"You know what?"
27:33;27:35;"Our whole business is hurting"
27:35;27:36;"With COVID"
27:36;27:37;"With ghost kitchens"
27:37;27:38;"And food delivery"
27:38;27:39;"We need to like"
27:39;27:41;"Actually band together"
27:41;27:43;"To make people understand"
27:43;27:44;"That we're something bigger"
27:44;27:45;"Than just our individual brands"
27:45;27:46;"And somebody's like"
27:46;27:47;"We've always been happy"
27:47;27:48;"To kind of lay back in the cut"
27:48;27:49;"And let the brands do the talking"
27:49;27:50;"And it's like no no no"
27:50;27:52;"We need to Avengers style"
27:52;27:53;"Make Inspire"
27:53;27:55;"Actually stand out"
27:55;27:57;"It's not enough just for the finance dudes"
27:57;27:58;"To know what Inspire is"
27:58;27:59;"We need regular people"
27:59;28:00;"To know what Inspire is"
28:00;28:02;"And then they actually start"
28:02;28:04;"Doing initiatives like that"
28:04;28:05;"Like man"
28:05;28:06;"You're an Inspire Head"
28:06;28:07;"And you didn't even know it"
28:07;28:08;"What?"
28:08;28:09;"How about this?"
28:09;28:10;"Have you ever"
28:10;28:12;"Have you ever hit Dunkin, Arby's"
28:12;28:15;"And Buffalo in the same day?"
28:15;28:16;"Many times"
28:16;28:17;"Well of course"
28:17;28:18;"Did you know that all three of those"
28:18;28:19;"Are our brands?"
28:19;28:21;"That is so cool"
28:21;28:22;"Here's a hat"
28:22;28:24;"Here's an Inspire sweatshirt"
28:24;28:26;"Inspired?"
28:26;28:31;"That's such a psychotic name"
28:31;28:32;"For a conglomerate"
28:32;28:33;"Wait Seinfeld"
28:33;28:35;"Also if memory serves"
28:35;28:37;"Inspire was started in 2018"
28:37;28:39;"Like they rebranded from"
28:39;28:40;"Arby's restaurant group"
28:40;28:41;"To Inspire"
28:41;28:43;"Which is just epic"
28:43;28:46;"That's correct"
28:46;28:47;"February 2018"
28:47;28:49;"They did the rebrand"
28:49;28:51;"Yeah maybe Arby's"
28:51;28:53;"Arby's is too evocative of one thing"
28:53;28:55;"I think that's like a classic thing"
28:55;28:57;"That happens with these big conglomerates"
28:57;28:58;"They're built around one brand"
28:58;28:59;"And eventually they're just like"
28:59;29:00;"We're so much more than this"
29:00;29:01;"Actually Seinfeld"
29:01;29:03;"Could you see if you can find"
29:03;29:05;"Any Inspire merch?"
29:05;29:07;"I'm sure it's internal use only"
29:07;29:08;"But maybe they have like"
29:08;29:10;"A company retreat"
29:10;29:11;"As Dunkin comes into"
29:11;29:13;"The Inspire family"
29:13;29:15;"There must be so many funny"
29:15;29:17;"Little corporate"
29:17;29:19;"Welcome to the team moments"
29:19;29:21;"Across the different departments"
29:21;29:23;"I guess it all happened in the COVID era"
29:23;29:25;"So there's probably some very awkward"
29:25;29:27;"I mean this is some real sh*t"
29:27;29:31;"There 100% was one or many"
29:31;29:33;"Giant zooms"
29:33;29:35;"That were about"
29:35;29:37;"Welcoming the Dunkin crew"
29:37;29:39;"To the Inspire family"
29:39;29:41;"Like the CEO just being like"
29:41;29:43;"Alright now the Dunkin team"
29:43;29:45;"I know you guys probably feel a little bit nervous"
29:45;29:47;"What's it gonna be like?"
29:47;29:48;"Well I'm here to tell you"
29:48;29:50;"That you're gonna fit right in"
29:50;29:51;"Oh and also think about the people"
29:51;29:53;"Who work on the Mr. Donut campaigns"
29:53;29:55;"They're probably pretty uneasy"
29:55;29:56;"Oh yeah they're on thin ice"
29:56;29:58;"Suddenly Dunkin's coming into the mix"
29:58;30:00;"God that's gotta be"
30:00;30:01;"Uncomfortable for them but"
30:01;30:03;"And there's definitely some social media"
30:03;30:05;"Like people getting to know each other"
30:05;30:07;"And straight up"
30:07;30:09;"There could be somebody from Arby's"
30:09;30:10;"Just being like"
30:10;30:11;"Listen after this"
30:11;30:13;"To the head of Dunkin's social media"
30:13;30:15;"I'd love to kinda just like"
30:15;30:17;"You know throw a few ideas around"
30:17;30:18;"Just the two of us"
30:18;30:19;"Because I honestly think"
30:19;30:21;"The interplay between Arby's and Dunkin"
30:21;30:23;"Could be so much fun"
30:23;30:24;"There's so much we could do here"
30:24;30:26;"This has happened"
30:26;30:27;"Unequivocally this has happened"
30:27;30:29;"This happened a few months ago"
30:29;30:33;"This is the HBO drama that we need to make"
30:33;30:34;"Oh absolutely"
30:34;30:35;"This is the Millennial Mad Men"
30:35;30:38;"Idea that we've been kicking around for years"
30:38;30:40;"Rusty Taco is just like"
30:40;30:42;"Set in the f***ing Covid era"
30:42;30:44;"Maybe we could start working on it now"
30:44;30:45;"Because maybe in five years"
30:45;30:47;"That would be like a cool opening"
30:47;30:49;"To our prestige drama"
30:49;30:51;"Is like it opens and it's just like"
30:51;30:52;"2020"
30:52;30:54;"It's just like the"
30:54;30:56;"170 person Zoom"
30:56;30:58;"That kicks off like the"
30:58;31:00;"The Dunkin era at Inspire"
31:00;31:02;"Obviously there's so many ways to tackle"
31:02;31:03;"The Dunkin story"
31:03;31:04;"And I'm sure I'll have a lot more"
31:04;31:07;"After I read Robert Rosenberg's book"
31:07;31:09;"But uh"
31:09;31:11;"I can't believe you're gonna read that"
31:11;31:13;"It's actually like a pretty slim book"
31:13;31:15;"I have a feeling I'll burn through it"
31:15;31:17;"I respect your"
31:17;31:19;"Sustained attention on that"
31:19;31:20;"That is"
31:20;31:22;"It's less than 200 pages"
31:22;31:23;"Alright"
31:23;31:25;"This is gonna turn the whole organization around I think"
31:25;31:27;"For Time Crisis"
31:27;31:28;"Maybe in like"
31:28;31:30;"Jumping on a conference call"
31:30;31:31;"For some Vampire Weekend s***"
31:31;31:33;"I'd just start offhandedly referring to like"
31:33;31:34;"Well you know Robert Rosenberg"
31:34;31:35;"People would be like wait"
31:35;31:37;"Robert Rosenberg?"
31:37;31:38;"Uh yeah you know"
31:38;31:39;"Robert Rosenberg in the 70s"
31:39;31:40;"Things got"
31:40;31:42;"People just have no idea what I'm talking about"
31:42;31:44;"Was he Tom Petty's manager?"
31:44;31:46;"Or who was that?"
31:46;31:48;"I think he was uh"
31:48;31:50;"Secretary of Defense"
31:50;31:52;"Under Reagan"
31:52;31:53;"Uh"
31:53;31:54;"He signed"
31:54;31:56;"REO Speedwagon"
31:56;31:58;"Um"
31:58;32:00;"You changed the direction of LP5"
32:00;32:02;"After reading"
32:02;32:04;"Robert Rosenberg"
32:04;32:05;"Robert Rosenberg"
32:05;32:07;"He was an abstract expressionist painter"
32:07;32:09;"He kind of came up in New York"
32:09;32:11;"Moved to Paris in the mid 50s"
32:11;32:13;"Very influential"
32:13;32:14;"But anyway"
32:14;32:16;"We could totally do the Duncan story"
32:16;32:18;"Oh actually this would be a good idea"
32:18;32:19;"Cause I was saying like"
32:19;32:20;"It would be very TC to"
32:20;32:22;"Kind of drop in 1963"
32:22;32:24;"Young Robert"
32:24;32:26;"Is kind of taking over the family business"
32:26;32:28;"Some real like in my neighborhood s***"
32:28;32:29;"You know open with like"
32:29;32:30;"A Beach Boys song"
32:30;32:31;"You know just like some"
32:31;32:32;"Yeah"
32:32;32:34;"Early 60s squeaky clean"
32:34;32:35;"And then"
32:35;32:36;"Or the Rondelles"
32:36;32:37;"Yeah"
32:38;32:39;"Bop bop"
32:39;32:41;"It's just like Mean Streets"
32:41;32:42;"Except it takes place in"
32:42;32:44;"Newton, Massachusetts"
32:44;32:45;"But"
32:45;32:47;"We want to make more of like a slick prestige drama"
32:47;32:49;"And rather than"
32:49;32:50;"Do it like this period piece"
32:50;32:52;"I like that it just opens like"
32:52;32:54;"Really dry"
32:54;32:56;"With kind of just like low quality"
32:56;32:58;"Computer audio"
32:58;32:59;"Just like am I on?"
32:59;33:00;"Like"
33:00;33:01;"Yeah"
33:01;33:02;"Okay"
33:02;33:03;"Like a kind of bad connection"
33:03;33:04;"Like god this f***ing connection"
33:04;33:06;"Okay anyway"
33:06;33:07;"Hey everybody"
33:07;33:08;"How's it going?"
33:08;33:09;"Like well"
33:09;33:10;"You know"
33:10;33:11;"I'm so excited"
33:11;33:12;"I feel bad saying it"
33:12;33:13;"It's the CEO of Inspired"
33:13;33:14;"I feel bad saying it"
33:14;33:15;"You know in the middle of a pandemic"
33:15;33:16;"So many people suffering"
33:16;33:17;"But"
33:17;33:19;"This has actually been an amazing year for us"
33:19;33:21;"With the acquisition of Duncan"
33:21;33:23;"And that's where we start"
33:23;33:25;"Maybe we could have some flashbacks"
33:25;33:26;"To the 60s"
33:26;33:27;"Oh big time"
33:27;33:29;"I think this is a pivotal moment"
33:29;33:30;"And we'll learn a lot"
33:30;33:31;"Over the next couple of years"
33:31;33:33;"About just how big this moment was"
33:33;33:35;"We'll see what Inspired does with it"
33:35;33:37;"I'm looking forward to the book report"
33:37;33:38;"Next episode"
33:38;33:39;"From you"
33:39;33:40;"On this"
33:40;33:41;"I mean grab a copy"
33:41;33:42;"And if anybody"
33:42;33:43;"I'm going to make it my business"
33:43;33:44;"To finish this"
33:44;33:45;"By the next time crisis"
33:45;33:47;"So if any"
33:47;33:49;"If any TC heads"
33:49;33:51;"Especially ones who are"
33:51;33:53;"Entrepreneurs fighting for survival"
33:53;33:54;"Or leaders in growing businesses"
33:54;33:56;"Facing critical strategic decisions"
33:56;33:59;"I recommend that you grab the book too"
33:59;34:01;"Around the corner"
34:01;34:02;"Around the world"
34:02;34:04;"Hey just to put a button in it"
34:04;34:05;"I'll just text it over to you as well"
34:05;34:06;"But if you hit up"
34:06;34:08;"Inspirebrandswag.com"
34:08;34:10;"You can see a full array of"
34:10;34:12;"Inspirebrands apparel"
34:12;34:14;"Wait this is real?"
34:14;34:15;"This is real"
34:15;34:16;"This is official?"
34:16;34:17;"This is official"
34:17;34:19;"You can get an Inspirebrands fleece"
34:19;34:20;"Full zip vest"
34:20;34:21;"An Inspirebrands tee"
34:21;34:22;"At a very reasonably priced"
34:22;34:24;"$8.25"
34:24;34:25;"Oh god"
34:25;34:28;"I hate the Inspirebrands logo"
34:28;34:29;"This is also though"
34:29;34:30;"To be fair"
34:30;34:31;"This already"
34:31;34:32;"Let alone in the future"
34:32;34:34;"Is so evocative"
34:34;34:36;"Of lame"
34:36;34:39;"Late 20 teens design"
34:39;34:40;"Yeah"
34:40;34:42;"This just kind of reminds me of like"
34:42;34:45;"Rolling up to some like weird"
34:45;34:46;"Barn grill"
34:46;34:47;"And like not being sure"
34:47;34:49;"If it's a giant chain"
34:49;34:51;"Or like an independent place"
34:51;34:52;"And it's like"
34:52;34:53;"They do like bowls"
34:53;34:54;"And they also have like"
34:54;34:56;"Local beer on tap"
34:56;34:57;"You just can't really like"
34:57;34:58;"Get a feel for it"
34:58;34:59;"Yeah and it's like"
34:59;35:01;"Oh someone designed that logo"
35:01;35:03;"In Adobe Illustrator"
35:03;35:04;"So cool"
35:04;35:05;"I'm looking at"
35:05;35:06;"It says Project Carryon"
35:06;35:08;"Inspirebrands"
35:08;35:09;"And it's a"
35:09;35:10;"A wheeled"
35:10;35:11;"Backpack"
35:11;35:12;"So that's"
35:12;35:13;"Pretty good for like"
35:13;35:15;"A business person on the go"
35:15;35:16;"Maybe doing like a quick"
35:16;35:17;"Day trip"
35:17;35:19;"To another city"
35:19;35:20;"Do a presentation"
35:20;35:21;"Back the same day"
35:21;35:22;"Although we'll see how much"
35:22;35:23;"Of that stuff happens"
35:23;35:24;"Post COVID"
35:24;35:25;"But looking at this"
35:25;35:27;"An Inspirebrands"
35:27;35:28;"Roller backpack"
35:28;35:30;"That seems like something"
35:30;35:31;"Which costs $185"
35:31;35:33;"On Inspirebrands swag"
35:33;35:34;"That seems like an object"
35:34;35:36;"That should only exist"
35:36;35:38;"As an internal"
35:38;35:40;"Gift to employees"
35:40;35:41;"Yeah"
35:41;35:42;"So part of me"
35:42;35:43;"Has like this weird"
35:43;35:45;"Dark feeling"
35:45;35:46;"Because obviously"
35:46;35:47;"Nobody would ever buy that"
35:47;35:48;"Just because they're like"
35:48;35:50;"A fan of Inspirebrands"
35:50;35:51;"Maybe after a few years"
35:51;35:52;"Of really building"
35:52;35:54;"The Inspirebrands name"
35:54;35:55;"With the new initiative"
35:55;35:56;"But I wonder if it's"
35:56;35:57;"Some weird like dark thing"
35:57;35:58;"Where like"
35:58;35:59;"The CEO's just like"
35:59;36:01;"Never gives the employees anything"
36:01;36:03;"And people are like"
36:03;36:04;"Yeah if you really want"
36:04;36:05;"To get ahead here"
36:05;36:06;"Roll up to the meeting"
36:06;36:08;"With the Inspirebrands backpack"
36:08;36:09;"Like"
36:09;36:10;"Wow dude"
36:10;36:11;"That's dark"
36:11;36:12;"I don't have one"
36:12;36:13;"Yeah you buy it on the website"
36:13;36:14;"How much is it?"
36:14;36:15;"$185"
36:15;36:16;"They're like"
36:16;36:17;"What?"
36:17;36:18;"And they're just like"
36:18;36:19;"My friend works at like"
36:19;36:20;"This like tiny little company"
36:20;36:21;"And they get backpacks"
36:21;36:22;"For free"
36:22;36:23;"Yeah you should just"
36:23;36:24;"Kind of like roll up"
36:24;36:25;"Be like"
36:25;36:26;"Dude it's worth it"
36:26;36:27;"It's worth it"
36:27;36:28;"Buying it dude"
36:28;36:29;"It seems crazy but"
36:29;36:30;"Hold on a second sir"
36:30;36:31;"Actually I got something"
36:31;36:32;"Here in my backpack"
36:32;36:33;"He's like"
36:33;36:34;"Pulls it up"
36:34;36:35;"Just rummages around"
36:35;36:36;"For a second"
36:36;36:37;"Very nice"
36:37;36:38;"Oh of course"
36:38;36:39;"I actually bought this"
36:39;36:40;"Before I worked here"
36:40;36:43;"Just a huge fan of the brand"
36:43;36:45;"Why has it got to be swag too?"
36:45;36:47;"Inspirebrands swag"
36:47;36:48;"I'd love to get some numbers"
36:48;36:49;"Who's buying this stuff?"
36:49;36:51;"What's the story?"
36:51;36:52;"If I had to guess"
36:52;36:53;"I would say that"
36:53;36:54;"They probably give this"
36:54;36:55;"To employees with a discount"
36:55;36:56;"But if you are like"
36:56;36:57;"A non-employee"
36:57;36:59;"Inspirebrands super fan"
36:59;37:01;"You can still get access"
37:01;37:02;"Wait hold on"
37:02;37:03;"This is really strange"
37:03;37:05;"I just went to the menu"
37:05;37:07;"This is gripping internet radio"
37:07;37:09;"I'm just describing in detail"
37:09;37:10;"We're just like"
37:10;37:12;"Checking out a website"
37:12;37:15;"Wait so where did you go though?"
37:15;37:16;"I want to follow along"
37:16;37:17;"You went to"
37:17;37:18;"I'm holding in my hands a phone"
37:18;37:19;"On this phone"
37:19;37:20;"I'm looking at a website"
37:20;37:21;"It's called"
37:21;37:23;"Inspirebrandswag.com"
37:23;37:24;"I went to the menu"
37:24;37:25;"And in the menu"
37:25;37:26;"There's a few links"
37:26;37:27;"To some other"
37:27;37:29;"Inspirebrands brands"
37:29;37:30;"Such as Arby's"
37:30;37:31;"Buffalo Wild Wings"
37:31;37:32;"And R-Taco"
37:32;37:33;"It doesn't even say"
37:33;37:34;"Rusty Taco"
37:34;37:35;"It says R-Taco"
37:35;37:36;"Anyway"
37:36;37:37;"I clicked on Buffalo Wild Wings"
37:37;37:38;"I thought it might take me"
37:38;37:39;"To just like"
37:39;37:40;"The Buffalo Wild Wings store"
37:40;37:41;"But it actually took me"
37:41;37:42;"To the B-dubs"
37:42;37:43;"Employee store"
37:43;37:44;"Oh yeah"
37:44;37:45;"I'm with you"
37:45;37:46;"I guess that exists"
37:46;37:47;"In a lot of industries"
37:47;37:48;"The concept of like"
37:48;37:49;"An employee store"
37:49;37:50;"But like"
37:50;37:51;"Why is it called"
37:51;37:52;"An employee store"
37:52;37:53;"Is some of this stuff"
37:53;37:54;"Actually"
37:54;37:55;"Well there's like"
37:55;37:56;"Men's Under Armour"
37:56;37:57;"Corporate Tech Polo"
37:57;37:58;"I love that they're just like"
37:58;37:59;"Spelling it out here"
37:59;38:00;"Corporate Tech Polo"
38:00;38:01;"So these are"
38:01;38:02;"Kind of different shades of grey"
38:02;38:03;"Under Armour polo shirts"
38:03;38:04;"You know"
38:04;38:05;"It's kind of like"
38:05;38:06;"For the modern golfer"
38:06;38:07;"I love"
38:07;38:08;"Corporate Tech Polo"
38:08;38:09;"There's also"
38:09;38:10;"A Adidas lightweight"
38:10;38:11;"Quarter zip"
38:11;38:12;"Pullover"
38:12;38:13;"Like"
38:13;38:14;"Okay so look at this"
38:14;38:15;"You might wear that"
38:15;38:16;"Going for a run or something"
38:16;38:17;"But it's like"
38:17;38:18;"It's a"
38:19;38:23;"going for a run or something. And I have a feeling we probably have somebody listening"
38:23;38:28;"who like has a better handle on this. I mean, some of us have worked in corporate environments."
38:28;38:34;"The concept of an employee store where the employee would pay for gear, I guess there"
38:34;38:40;"are jobs where, you know, just like classic, just like treating employees like, where they,"
38:40;38:45;"you kind of like pay for your uniform. That's a thing, right? Yeah, I don't think that's"
38:45;38:46;"what's happening here."
38:46;38:52;"I think because I worked at one of these major companies and I think, you know, so is Seinfeld."
38:52;38:59;"I think that what's happening is that the managers of these places are buying swag for"
38:59;39:05;"their employees probably through their internal budgets. So I would like to think it's not"
39:05;39:11;"as brutal as saying, here's some, you know, sort of low level manager coordinator that's"
39:11;39:17;"here. You want to wear this, you buy it yourself, but hey, it's Christmas. Here's a lot of"
39:17;39:20;"hand sanitizer for you guys and it will come out of a budget."
39:20;39:25;"Yeah, I think the odd thing is that it's available to the general public."
39:25;39:30;"Yeah, obviously Inspire Brands is not popular yet. Obviously we're doing our part here on"
39:30;39:36;"the show. We're going to really try to make Inspire a brand as well known as a Dunkin."
39:36;39:40;"It might take a while, but why not? But why is it called the employee store for Buffalo"
39:40;39:44;"Wild Wings? Because I'm totally willing to believe that there are Buffalo Wild Wings"
39:44;39:46;"fans out there."
39:46;39:47;"Big time."
39:47;39:50;"I'm willing to believe that there's people who want to buy a Buffalo Wild Wings t-shirt"
39:50;39:56;"and I'm sure they sell them at the place, at the restaurant. So I guess my question"
39:56;40:02;"here is like, given that they clearly could sell merch, why is it called an employee store?"
40:02;40:05;"See that's what makes me feel like maybe I'm missing something really basic where somebody's"
40:05;40:09;"like, oh, employee store. That just, that means something, I guess. Like, why is it"
40:09;40:11;"not just the Buffalo Wild Wings merch store?"
40:11;40:18;"I think Nick was onto something. I mean, are you seeing the like 10 by 10 foot pop-up tent?"
40:18;40:19;"Yes."
40:19;40:26;"For $1,100. And then you can get a custom Buffalo Wild Wings mountain bike for $215."
40:26;40:30;"Matt found a pair of Vans, Buffalo Wild Wings Vans."
40:30;40:32;"Yeah, the pricing is all over the place."
40:32;40:34;"You could have a whole Buffalo Wild Wings lifestyle. Okay, wait, here's the guess. This"
40:34;40:39;"is kind of similar to what you're saying, Nick, but like, we don't know the whole corporate"
40:39;40:42;"structure of Buffalo Wild Wings. And I think it's very important to understand what the"
40:42;40:50;"franchisee relationship is here. Because if it's just one giant company where corporate"
40:50;40:55;"controls every little thing, it wouldn't make sense for the manager to be like buying stuff"
40:55;40:59;"out of his budget. But if it's, maybe it's like a franchise thing where it's like, okay,"
40:59;41:05;"you opened a Buffalo Wild Wings, you have the right to be the franchisee in, you know,"
41:05;41:10;"this part of Kansas City or whatever. But of course, you follow certain guidelines and"
41:10;41:15;"you can't just start printing up your own Buffalo Wild Wing gear for your employees."
41:15;41:21;"We're not telling you, you have to have them, you know, wear anything other than our standard"
41:21;41:29;"uniform. But if you as a franchisee, manager, whatever, want to, you're allowed some degree"
41:29;41:34;"of flexibility within the confines of the corporate universe."
41:34;41:38;"Maybe time creates, we open up a Buffalo Wild Wings and suddenly we're invested in the whole"
41:38;41:44;"brand and we decide we want to splash out on ourselves. Maybe we make our own rule that"
41:44;41:50;"employees got to throw on the Adidas half zip when they go outside on break or something."
41:50;41:54;"Maybe it is, you can only buy it from the company store."
41:54;41:58;"I'm looking at the numbers right now. Buffalo Wild Wings seeks area development franchisees"
41:58;42:02;"with a minimum commitment to open two restaurants."
42:02;42:07;"So Travis Scott opens up a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the Houston area and of course, he's"
42:07;42:14;"a very creative guy. He wants to start making all his own merch. He wants to collab with"
42:14;42:20;"Cactus Flea Market and Capital and all this and they're like, Travis, we're not McDonald's."
42:20;42:25;"We didn't, you know, you're a franchisee. If you want to have some fun, by all means,"
42:25;42:31;"visit our store, go wild. You can buy our tent, you can buy our cornhole set. In your"
42:31;42:36;"eyes, you could have cornhole day in the parking lot, but you better buy an official Buffalo"
42:36;42:41;"Wild Wings cornhole set and get the tent too for the DJ. You know, if it's going to be"
42:41;42:47;"sunny. I mean, I keep thinking and maybe we should get into some music. My dad had the"
42:47;42:51;"record of it and I think this is like a very well known song, but I'd always listen to"
42:51;42:57;"this record growing up. I think it's Tennessee Ernie Ford. That song, 16 tons. You guys know"
42:57;42:58;"it?"
42:58;42:59;"I don't know if I heard it. Maybe."
42:59;43:06;"Can we throw that on? 16 tons? Because basically it has this line about I owe my soul to the"
43:06;43:09;"company store."
43:09;43:21;"Some people say a man is made out of mud. A poor man's made out of muscle and blood."
43:21;43:27;"Muscle and blood and skin and bones. A mind that's weak and a back that's strong. You"
43:27;43:34;"load 16 tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter, don't"
43:34;43:41;"you call me cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store."
43:41;43:43;"This is the theme song to our show."
43:43;43:47;"Yeah. For the Inspire brand."
43:47;43:53;"Born one morning when the sun didn't shine. I picked up my shovel and I walked to the"
43:53;43:57;"mine. I loaded 16 tons. Oh, it's about a minor mining coal, of course. A number nine coal"
43:57;44:04;"and a straw ball said, well, bless my soul, you load 16 tons. What do you get? Another"
44:04;44:12;"day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter, don't you call me cause I can't go. I owe my soul"
44:12;44:15;"to the company store."
44:15;44:22;"When is this from? Wait, pause it for a second. Actually, it's a pretty haunting song. I mean,"
44:22;44:28;"I always found it very vibey. Looking at the lyrics, I'm realizing like, okay, so the song"
44:28;44:33;"was written by Merle Travis, Tennessee Ernie Ford had like the big hit version of it. It"
44:33;44:42;"went to number one in 1955. Yeah, the lyrics are like super dark. The chorus, you load"
44:42;44:48;"16 tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter, don't you call"
44:48;44:53;"me cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store. Which, obviously there's a"
44:53;44:59;"lot of songs about like Rush, about a working man. In that sense, this is a working man"
44:59;45:05;"song, but it's even more specific because it's about basically the impossibility. In"
45:05;45:09;"that sense, it's very not the American dream. It's about the impossibility of working your"
45:09;45:14;"way out of debt. That basically like the same company that you work for turns you into like"
45:14;45:16;"an indentured servant."
45:16;45:18;"Because you're living in like company housing."
45:18;45:24;"Yeah, exactly. Because there used to be all these like company towns. I'm sure some people"
45:24;45:29;"would say there still are in a sense, but there used to literally be weird semi-temporary"
45:29;45:36;"housing for families where somebody was working at the mine and they probably didn't have"
45:36;45:40;"time or the possibility of going anywhere else to buy anything. The company store could"
45:40;45:45;"probably like overcharge them and they could like, yeah, advance them some money so they"
45:45;45:48;"could buy like groceries and then you got to work it off."
45:48;45:49;"Yeah."
45:49;45:50;"Real nightmare."
45:50;45:53;"I think in like, yeah, like those like some of those mining communities that were in the"
45:53;45:58;"middle of nowhere or like probably out west too. I don't really know the, I can't think"
45:58;45:59;"of specific examples, but like."
45:59;46:03;"Oh, we played a little more. Looking ahead, there's some good lyrics."
46:03;46:10;"What do they call this genre? It's like kind of jazzy."
46:10;46:11;"I know. It's like jazzy country."
46:11;46:12;"Jazz, but jazzy country. Yeah."
46:12;46:36;"Wikipedia classifies it as folk. Just a folk song."
46:36;46:41;"Real minimalist. Well, there's a lot of towns that used to be company towns."
46:41;46:54;"If you go to the Wikipedia page for company town, it's like every state has died."
46:54;46:59;"This verse is very interesting to me. The final verse. I love that. A classic like final"
46:59;47:04;"verse turn. I don't know if he's like transitioning to like becoming like a revolutionary or something."
47:04;47:09;"Cause in the beginning he's just talking about like, I work this like brutal job as a miner."
47:09;47:15;"I'm in debt to the company store. It's feels so futile. And then by the end he says, if"
47:15;47:23;"you see me coming, better step aside. A lot of men didn't. A lot of men died. So I'm like,"
47:23;47:28;"is this the same dude saying like, watch out for me cause I'll kill you? Or is he taking"
47:28;47:33;"on the voice of like capitalism? You know what I mean?"
47:33;47:39;"One fist of iron, the other of steel. And this, I wonder if this inspired Robert Hunter,"
47:39;47:45;"if the right one don't get you, then the left one will. It's like the wheel. If the thunder"
47:45;47:51;"don't get you, then the lightning will. I'm just like curious about the song starts out"
47:51;47:55;"basically being like, I have, I work this brutal job and at the end I've got one fist"
47:55;47:59;"of iron, the other of steel. If the right one don't get you, then the left one will."
47:59;48:04;"I wonder if that is like creating a character out like if he's speaking from the point of"
48:04;48:12;"view of like the job of like the mining industry, that's like one way or another you're f***ed."
48:12;48:15;"It's like a strange metaphor for a song that starts out very unmetaphorical."
48:15;48:18;"Yeah, it's so nuts and bolts."
48:18;48:24;"It really is like a deeply hopeless song. I wonder if there's anybody listening who"
48:24;48:30;"works for inspire and they're just like, holy s***. This is a real special day. But I would"
48:30;48:34;"love just to get a little more perspective on this. I think we've got some good guesses,"
48:34;48:40;"but like the concept of like an online employee store, especially at a place where presumably"
48:40;48:45;"you have a simple uniform. Is it really just as simple as like, yeah, if you're an employee,"
48:45;48:51;"you want to rep our brand. Cool. Buy it. Anybody has any insight, please email us."
48:51;48:57;"Okay. I don't know if this is going to clarify too much, but so it looks like the company"
48:57;49:06;"that makes this stuff for Buffalo Wild Wings is a on demand store. BWW supply chain department"
49:06;49:10;"is responsible for ordering the merchandise and apparel found on point B storefront. Our"
49:10;49:16;"goal is to match the product supply with the restaurant demand, but avoid access inventory."
49:16;49:20;"The quantity supply chain orders and determine blah, blah, blah. So it seems like none of"
49:20;49:25;"this exists. Right. It is like an idea."
49:25;49:29;"This is very resonant with the Travis Scott stuff."
49:29;49:35;"It's like the Supreme brick. You know, the same peace of mind that a hype beast gets"
49:35;49:40;"when they might look at the hype beast website and, or, you know, browse StockX and, you"
49:40;49:44;"know, they may, they only have a few hundred bucks in their savings account. They're never"
49:44;49:51;"going to be able to buy a, you know, a $3,000 pair of chunky donkeys. But by merely looking"
49:51;49:56;"at the products, it gives them a sense of stability. It shows them where they are in"
49:56;50:00;"the world. It gives them something to strive for. It makes them feel part of a community."
50:00;50:05;"When you see that chunky donkey, it'll never be yours, but just to know that it's there,"
50:05;50:10;"maybe somebody else is buying it. It maybe makes you feel that buying, you know, your"
50:10;50:15;"more modest $50 pairs of shoes, you know, is like taking you somewhere."
50:15;50:16;"It's aspirational."
50:16;50:20;"Yeah, it's aspirational. Maybe it's the same thing is that, you know, you're a Buffalo"
50:20;50:25;"and Wild Wings employee and probably the first thing you're thinking is like, what's my future"
50:25;50:31;"here? For a long time, the, you know, working at, in a retail fast-ish food environment"
50:31;50:38;"was shorthand in America for like going nowhere. You know, that kind of cruel, you want fries"
50:38;50:42;"with that joke. I guess it's kind of like an eighties joke. It's just like, Hey, you"
50:42;50:46;"better stay in school. You're going to be asking people if they want fries with that."
50:46;50:53;"So maybe in a way, Buffalo Wild Wings is like, we want our employees to feel a sense that"
50:53;50:58;"they're part of a bigger universe and maybe having a store, even if these products don't"
50:58;51:05;"exist, they're on demand. They're selling exactly zero cornhole sets a year. Maybe it"
51:05;51:08;"does give people like a sense of a community or something like that."
51:08;51:13;"I just keep thinking of the famous Gene Simmons quote, who wants to be in a rock and roll"
51:13;51:21;"band? I want to be in a rock and roll brand. Did he really say that? On fresh air with"
51:21;51:26;"Terry Gross? Wow. I guess at the time people were probably like a lot of people were grossed"
51:26;51:31;"out. They're like, man, I never kiss. That's lame. But you know, look at Travis Scott."
51:31;51:35;"He was the original Travis Scott. I bet that interviews from like 20 years ago, at least"
51:35;51:39;"maybe nineties. He was forward thinking. It probably seemed very unrock and roll at the"
51:39;51:44;"time, but now we can look back and say, you know what Gene Simmons, you're pretty cool,"
51:44;51:48;"man. You were ahead of the time."
51:48;51:51;"Brutal."
52:04;52:29;"What are we doing on the show today?"
52:29;52:30;"Yeah. Should we start the show?"
52:30;52:36;"We haven't even gotten to the room yet."
52:36;52:42;"Let's really start the show now. Okay. So that was our intro. Welcome to Time Crisis."
52:42;52:48;"This is the second episode of 2021. I'm Ezra Koenig and I'm joined as always by my good"
52:48;52:53;"friend and co-host Jake Longstreth. Jake, how are you doing man?"
52:53;52:54;"What up?"
52:54;53:00;"All right, let's pump this up. I'm fired up man. So before things kicked off, we had"
53:00;53:05;"a kind of interesting, maybe a little dry conversation about Jake's new freezer, as"
53:05;53:09;"well as inspire brands purchase of Dunkin Donuts. But now we're going to be listening"
53:09;53:16;"to some really cool new music. We're taking your phone calls. We're going to be breaking"
53:16;53:21;"down President Biden's top five favorite country rap hits."
53:29;53:34;"Actually, my mind just started going into like weird TC associations we could make if"
53:34;53:39;"we were trying to do like New Year, new era, like what's up? And I was like thinking like,"
53:39;53:45;"well, Kamala Harris is the first person in the White House. Obviously she's the first"
53:45;53:51;"of many things as people have been talking about, but she's also the first person from"
53:51;53:56;"SF, from the Bay in a long time in the White House. I mean, off the top of my head, I can't"
53:56;54:02;"think of anybody. I mean, Nixon was from California, but not the Bay. It's like a pretty specific"
54:02;54:04;"influential part of the country, but like-"
54:04;54:07;"Yeah, that's a good point. In terms of president or vice president, you mean?"
54:07;54:11;"Let's say that when you're in the White House, you got to be president or vice president."
54:11;54:12;"Yeah."
54:12;54:17;"When was the last time someone from the Bay was in the White House?"
54:17;54:21;"Honestly, it might be the first time. In terms of the Western presidents, I mean, there's"
54:21;54:22;"been Reagan."
54:22;54:23;"Nixon."
54:23;54:28;"I mean, we can just go back. I mean, yeah, like Jimmy Carter was from the South, JFK,"
54:28;54:32;"Eisenhower. Then like, I think before World War II, it's going to be all East Coast probably,"
54:32;54:33;"right?"
54:33;54:37;"So San Francisco, the Bay area, again, very influential part of the country. Hasn't been"
54:37;54:44;"somebody from there. I guess the natural question would be if we had Kamala on the show, let's"
54:44;54:48;"assume we didn't want to talk about any of the important issues facing the nation."
54:48;54:49;"Oh, absolutely not."
54:49;54:56;"It would actually be a reasonable question to ask if growing up in the Bay, she had any"
54:56;55:00;"particular relationship or even saw The Grateful Dead. Maybe she saw Jerry."
55:00;55:04;"Oakland Coliseum show, '83."
55:04;55:08;"It's totally possible. I mean, I remember in the primaries, there were a few kind of"
55:08;55:11;"embarrassing moments because people want to ask her a lot of questions about like hip"
55:11;55:17;"hop and there was all this controversy about her saying she was Snoop Dogg in college,"
55:17;55:21;"but she wouldn't have been in college then. All like listening to weed, smoking weed,"
55:21;55:26;"whatever. But so she was getting a lot of hip hop questions. Nobody thought or wanted"
55:26;55:32;"to ask her about, you know, you're like, you're from the Bay. The most influential musicians"
55:32;55:36;"out of the Bay Area are The Grateful Dead. Not saying you have to like them, but do you"
55:36;55:37;"have any relationship with them?"
55:37;55:42;"I imagine if you're like growing up in the Bay Area, it's very possible that even as"
55:42;55:47;"a non fan, you might get dragged to like the lot of an Oakland Coliseum show, something"
55:47;55:48;"like that."
55:48;55:49;"She's born in '64."
55:49;55:52;"Perfect age to catch some Dead shows."
55:52;55:56;"And she also would have been the right age for like Bay Area punk."
55:56;55:57;"Yeah."
55:57;55:59;"Dead Kennedy show in like '82 when she's like 18."
55:59;56:07;"Oh no, I never, I was never into The Grateful Dead. I never got to see them. Yeah, no, I"
56:07;56:10;"didn't. Cause in the early eighties I was a punk rocker. I would, you would have found"
56:10;56:14;"me at a Dead Kennedy's show. And even when I was a little bit older, you know, I actually"
56:14;56:19;"caught some early Op Ivy shows at Gilman street."
56:19;56:24;"The last time I went to Gilman street was actually to see a little known local band"
56:24;56:25;"called Green Day."
56:25;56:29;"All right. Well just, yeah, it crossed my mind."
56:29;56:30;"This is a great fantasy."
56:30;56:35;"As we were just kind of kicking into high gear. We very slowly dip back down to the"
56:35;56:40;"classic TC cruising speed. We came in hot."
56:40;56:45;"Speculating wildly about what people think of The Grateful Dead in what concerts they"
56:45;56:49;"saw. That is one of my favorite things to do. It is true."
56:49;56:54;"Wait, Seinfeld, just number crunch. Does anything come up when you search Kamala Harris, Grateful"
56:54;56:55;"Dead?"
56:55;57:00;"The first headline is Kamala Harris got so high smoking weed in college, she thought"
57:00;57:04;"she was listening to Snoop Dogg and Tupac."
57:04;57:07;"Oh, they're making fun of her probably because"
57:07;57:10;"She was in college before then? Is that what they're saying?"
57:10;57:14;"Yeah, she would have been a little, yeah."
57:14;57:18;"You know what? That's classic, like older person. Like it's like something my mom would"
57:18;57:22;"do about like, oh yeah, I saw the doors in like 72."
57:22;57:26;"Like well, it depends on how much of a music nerd you are because I know Jake, if you're"
57:26;57:31;"running for president anytime, even in 20 years from now and somebody who's like, Jake,"
57:31;57:35;"did you listen to much of the Strokes in college? You'd be like, first of all, the Strokes first"
57:35;57:40;"album came out in 2001. I was graduated by then. I went to college. You would know that"
57:40;57:41;"off the top of your head."
57:41;57:42;"Oh, absolutely."
57:42;57:44;"Where did Kamala Harris go to high school?"
57:44;57:46;"I think in Oakland."
57:46;57:48;"I guess she lived for a bit actually in Montreal."
57:48;57:51;"Oh wow. West Mount High School."
57:51;57:55;"Anyway, congratulations to the Bay Area."
57:55;58:01;"Bay Area and the White House. I love it. I love it."
58:01;58:05;"I looked up to see if Doug Emhoff, you know, her husband, Kamala Harris' husband, if he"
58:05;58:09;"were into the dead. The only thing I'm really finding out, I don't know if this is mentioned,"
58:09;58:16;"is that he loves golf and fantasy football. And he even named a team, his fantasy football"
58:16;58:20;"team Nirvana after the 90s grunge band."
58:20;58:21;"Okay."
58:21;58:25;"I just like naming your fantasy football team Nirvana."
58:25;58:30;"It's pretty weak."
58:30;58:35;"Naming anything Nirvana after the band is just kind of inherently strange. Just because"
58:35;58:41;"it's already a word. And it's also just like, they're just like too big of a band to name"
58:41;58:47;"anything after. Just like naming your dog Nirvana. Nirvana is kind of a tight name for"
58:47;58:50;"a dog, but then just people are like, ""Oh, how'd you come up with the name Nirvana?"""
58:50;58:53;"It's like, ""Like the band."""
58:53;59:02;"He recently tweeted in 2017, Doug Emhoff, ""My fantasy football team is still named Nirvana."
59:02;59:03;"Need I say more? #KirkCobain50RIP."""
59:03;59:14;"Okay. So Emhoff is like a Nirvana head. I wonder if Emhoff would call in."
59:14;59:19;"I think we could try to track him down. I mean, he's kind of like a showbiz guy, right?"
59:19;59:21;"He's the first second gentleman."
59:21;59:27;"Oh, right. The first second gentleman. Did we ever talk about that on this show or was"
59:27;59:33;"that just on the text thread? There was a lot of enjoyment, I remember, on the TC text"
59:33;59:38;"thread. Oh, wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe actually... Sorry, guys. This might've been on my text"
59:38;59:42;"thread with CT and Bayo. I feel like Bayo was talking about... I think I brought it"
59:42;59:48;"into our text thread though, but Bayo was talking about Doug being the first gentleman."
59:48;59:53;"And there's also some conversation about him being the first... He's the first Jewish gentleman."
59:53;59:54;"That was on the TC thread."
59:54;59:58;"Oh, that was on the TC thread that he's the first Jewish gentleman. There's just something"
59:58;01:00:03;"funny about being... He's the first second gentleman, period. But to also be like, he's"
01:00:03;01:00:08;"also the first Jewish second gentleman. It's also funny because I guess, obviously, it's"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"new for there to be a second gentleman, so that certainly is worth noting. But even the"
01:00:12;01:00:18;"phrase second lady, if you had said that to me with no context, five, 10 years ago, and"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"you just said, ""What does second lady refer to?"" I really would have racked my brain."
01:00:23;01:00:32;"Being like, ""Second lady, is that some old fashioned designation at a restaurant? Is"
01:00:32;01:00:37;"it a showbiz term, second lady?"" The last thing I would have thought of would be like,"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"""Oh, well, you mean the vice president's wife. That's the second lady."""
01:00:40;01:00:45;"Anyway, so the fact that the second lady is already kind of like a somewhat alien phrase,"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"and then you get it. Now we got the second gentleman, and now you got the first second"
01:00:48;01:00:53;"gentleman, and now you got the first Jewish second gentleman. Truly delightful."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"The first Jewish second gentleman."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"The first Jewish second gentleman."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"A new novel by Jonathan Franzen."
01:01:01;01:01:06;"The first Jewish second gentleman. Doug, who knows, man? You could become the first Jewish"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"first gentleman."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"All right."
01:01:08;01:01:16;"Here's hoping. Oh, I guess he was a lawyer. All right. Just a couple lawyers in the White"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"House."
01:01:17;01:01:26;"I got a pretty tight text from an old friend of mine, shout out Eli Bush, who forwarded"
01:01:26;01:01:33;"me a tweet by @bowiesongs that's the real story behind Harmonica Gate. This refers to"
01:01:33;01:01:40;"Bob Dylan's 1984 Jokerman Letterman performance. Now, obviously on this show, we've talked"
01:01:40;01:01:45;"at length about the song Jokerman. We even did some original research where we interviewed"
01:01:45;01:01:50;"the font designer who created the font Jokerman, and we confirmed for the first time in history"
01:01:50;01:01:55;"that the font is named after the Bob Dylan song. But it's a great Bob Dylan song. Definitely"
01:01:55;01:02:00;"one of my favorites. Vampire Weekend actually started covering it a lot in the last couple"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"of years."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"Great version."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"Thank you. I wonder how many times we played that. I feel like we must have dropped that"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"at least eight or nine times."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"I remember seeing it at Webster Hall."
01:02:10;01:02:15;"Oh, yeah. Definitely did it at Webster. And you know, like occasionally, because our version"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"is fairly long. It's about 10 minutes."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"That's deep."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Because it's already a long song. And then we wanted to make it a little special. So"
01:02:22;01:02:28;"we got this kind of like, almost like Krautrock Jam part that happens."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Right, right."
01:02:29;01:02:34;"And it's not a song that everybody knows. So, you know, we've dropped it here and there."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"My memory of playing it is that it's always like, a little bit nerve wracking, because"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"sometimes I'll set it up and be like, this is a song by Bob Dylan. And like the crowd"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"like, not go crazy, but like, whoa, because you know, there's always gonna be some Bob"
01:02:45;01:02:50;"Dylan fans in the crowd. And I'll be right. And it's a great song and inspired a great"
01:02:50;01:02:54;"font. And then it's like a little confused murmuring, maybe like one person or three"
01:02:54;01:03:00;"people are like, oh, like Joker man. And then that really small contingent yells their head"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"off."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"But yeah, TC heads."
01:03:04;01:03:09;"The TC heads. Yeah. And we dropped it at some like pretty big shows. Once at a festival"
01:03:09;01:03:14;"in the Netherlands. Definitely a little bit of confusion on the front end of it. But there"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"is something about it being 10 minutes that by the end, I almost always felt like we won"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"people over."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"That's a good. Oh, wow. That's cool. But anyway, back to this specific performance"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"of Joker man. So being a real Joker man had, I'm pretty familiar with all the Joker man"
01:03:28;01:03:37;"content on YouTube. And this is like real classic, because as I recall, Bob is playing"
01:03:37;01:03:43;"with basically a punk band. And I think at this time, his backing band was an LA based"
01:03:43;01:03:48;"punk band called the plugs. PLUGZ, who I was always kind of familiar with, because they're"
01:03:48;01:03:55;"in the movie and on the soundtrack to Repo Man, which is a very influential film for"
01:03:55;01:04:00;"me. Definitely a major rental in the late 90s for me."
01:04:00;01:04:07;"So anyway, the 80s were like a strange period for him. He was getting savaged by the critics"
01:04:07;01:04:12;"a lot as I understand it. Coming out of his Christian period, which was in some ways like"
01:04:12;01:04:18;"a low point for some of his fans, still wasn't at his 90s kind of revival, kind of being"
01:04:18;01:04:23;"treated like the OG once again and making these kind of like tasteful records that were"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"like winning Grammys and selling a lot of copies. So 84 is like a strange time for Dylan."
01:04:28;01:04:33;"And you know, he's a vibe sensitive dude. He probably was interested in like all this"
01:04:33;01:04:39;"new music happening, including punk rock and was like, how do I fit into this? And maybe"
01:04:39;01:04:43;"he sees this band, like LA punk band. He's just like, man, this is that energy I want."
01:04:43;01:04:48;"This reminds me of like seeing, you know, the Jayhawks in the 60s, like, let's do this."
01:04:48;01:04:52;"So anyway, that's kind of what was going on. And he comes out to do Joker Man. And by the"
01:04:52;01:04:57;"way, you know, the original Joker Man, it's the rhythm section is Sly and Robbie, the"
01:04:57;01:05:04;"iconic, you know, reggae Jamaican rhythm section. So that has like a real nice feel, bouncy,"
01:05:04;01:05:09;"you know, Jamaican vibe to it. So, you know, he's doing some different ****, busting out"
01:05:09;01:05:15;"the song with a punk band. And it definitely sounds like crazy-ish, but a lot of Bob Dylan"
01:05:15;01:05:20;"live sounds a little bit crazy. And so anyway, I didn't know that there was this deep story."
01:05:20;01:05:25;"And this is what the tweet says. This is the real story behind Harmonica Gate. I was the"
01:05:25;01:05:29;"person who handed Bob Dylan the harmonica during his performance on David Letterman."
01:05:29;01:05:33;"My name is Ed. And back in the day, I worked for one of the biggest rock and roll production"
01:05:33;01:05:38;"managers in the country, Michael Ahern, who in turn worked for Bill Graham. At the time,"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"Bill Graham was doing production for Bob Dylan. I got a call from Michael saying Dylan was"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"appearing on the David Letterman show the following week. And could I take care of his"
01:05:44;01:05:49;"backline duties? That means drums, amps, guitars, blah, blah, blah. Bob was scheduled to perform"
01:05:49;01:05:53;"two songs on the show that night. On the second song, he told me to have a harmonica in a"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"certain key sitting on his Marshall amplifier so he could pick it up and play it towards"
01:05:56;01:06:00;"the end of the song. He used it and everything worked out perfectly. At that point, I figured"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"my job was pretty much over for the night. You know, wait for the show to finish, pack"
01:06:03;01:06:07;"up the gear and go home. Then all of a sudden, I was told by Bob's son that Letterman asked"
01:06:07;01:06:12;"Bob to do a third song to close the show and I should have a harmonica ready again. He"
01:06:12;01:06:16;"said it should be in the key of D, if I remember correctly. Now, Bob's son was still a teenager"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"at this moment and I was a little wary of the messenger, so I took it upon myself to"
01:06:19;01:06:25;"go backstage to the dressing room to ask Bob personally. I wonder if it was Jacob."
01:06:25;01:06:28;"I was wondering that too. This is an '84?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"It seems right. Yeah."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"Does he have a kid older than Jacob?"
01:06:32;01:06:38;"He also has a son who is a director who directed the Will Ferrell soccer comedy, Kicking and"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Screaming."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"Oh, wow. Anyway, let's keep moving."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"So he goes backstage to Bob. When I got there, he's really busy talking to some industry"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"types and I said, ""Bob, your son said you need a harmonica in the key of D for the last"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"song."" Bob turns to me and said, ""Oh, yeah, that's right."" So I figured, ""Great, end of"
01:06:52;01:06:56;"story."" But no, not end of story because Bob mistakenly, because he was busy with the guests,"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"told me, ""Oh, yeah, sure."" Bob was wrong. Long story short, he puts the D harmonica"
01:07:02;01:07:08;"up there and anybody who's not familiar with harmonicas knows, as opposed to most other"
01:07:08;01:07:13;"instruments where you could just hit the right notes, you don't have that option in a harmonica"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"unless it's a chromatic harmonica. So it's like, if it's in D and you're trying to do"
01:07:17;01:07:22;"G, you're going to be hitting at least one wrong note. You're just kind of like, ""F***."""
01:07:22;01:07:26;"So they're doing the song. Halfway through, Bob takes off his guitar, hands it to me,"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"takes off the harmonica, starts blowing, immediately stops and looks to me and says, ""What the"
01:07:29;01:07:33;"f*** is in the wrong key?"" I said, ""What key do you need?"" And he says, ""G."" I think to"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"myself, ""Oh, s***, the harmonica's on the other side of the drums."" He runs to get it."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"After the song was over, I turned to Bob and said, ""What happened? What happened?"" He said,"
01:07:40;01:07:44;"""I got mixed up."" All of a sudden, Bob's manager, Mick Brigden, was all over me saying, ""What"
01:07:44;01:07:48;"the hell just happened?"" I said, ""Bob asked for the wrong harp."" He said, ""Don't you move."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"Wait right here."" He came back two minutes later and said, ""Never mind."" I started to"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"pack up the gear, thinking, ""F***, these guys are never going to hire me again."" A month"
01:07:53;01:07:58;"later, I got a call asking me if I'd go on the upcoming European tour as his guitar tech."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Well, that's pretty tight."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"They didn't throw this guy under the bus."
01:08:02;01:08:08;"I mean, arguably, if you're the guy who hands Bob Dylan the harmonica, you, in a sense,"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"have one job. Just get the gear s*** right."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Yeah."
01:08:11;01:08:16;"Does that mean Bob realized it was his fault? But I guess I never quite realized that he"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"had the wrong harmonica, even though I've watched this before."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"Do you want to bring it up?"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"Yeah, let's listen. Let's see just how crazy this sounds."
01:08:24;01:08:38;"I'm kind of curious to hear the groove too."
01:08:38;01:08:39;"Very different from the studio recording."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"Yeah."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Kind of like a Rolling Stones groove."
01:08:41;01:08:51;"And the bass is all just straight eighth notes."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"Yeah."
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Like very classic punk."
01:08:56;01:09:01;"Sounds good though."
01:09:01;01:09:07;"Yeah. A touch of replacements."
01:09:07;01:09:10;"Yeah, it does sound like the replacements."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"They're kind of stonesy, you're right."
01:09:11;01:09:12;"Yeah."
01:09:12;01:09:39;"That's pretty cool. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like"
01:09:39;01:09:44;"that."
01:09:44;01:09:54;"That's pretty GBV."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"Yeah."
01:09:56;01:10:02;"Let's get back to when he fixed up the harmonica."
01:10:02;01:10:14;"I heard it. That was a pretty rough intro. Is that all he did? He just very quickly realized"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"that was wrong?"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Yeah."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Does he look angry in the video?"
01:10:17;01:10:24;"I mean, he's walking all over the stage. It's like he's forgotten something. I mean, it's"
01:10:24;01:10:46;"way more awkward than him playing a bad harmonica."
01:10:46;01:10:52;"Wait, so go back to that. It's hilarious. It's hilarious that this dude is going this"
01:10:52;01:10:56;"harmonica game."
01:10:56;01:11:04;"Alright, pause. It's raw, but it's like a very tight performance. The band's holding"
01:11:04;01:11:10;"it down. But it's just like, of all the notes that he could have picked in the key of D,"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"he just said like the absolute wrong."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Like the F sharp?"
01:11:15;01:11:22;"Yeah. Or the C sharp. I guess if it's in G, who knows? Maybe this guy's not remembering"
01:11:22;01:11:26;"correctly anyway. It could have been more wrong than that. Alright, well, that's an"
01:11:26;01:11:34;"extremely minor speed bump in this performance. I guess when I saw that it said harmonica"
01:11:34;01:11:38;"gate, I was kind of like picturing it to be a little more of a disaster. But I guess like"
01:11:38;01:11:44;"Dylan heads are so hardcore that they've probably been like, man, what happened? We've all seen"
01:11:44;01:11:49;"the video. You hear those two weird notes. Bob paces around a little bit like, well,"
01:11:49;01:11:56;"what was the story? And as you might expect, the story is he was handed the wrong harmonica."
01:11:56;01:12:04;"I like that it brought us to that great raw performance. Bob's punk phase. Should we get"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"in the top five?"
01:12:05;01:12:10;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:12:10;01:12:16;"So now we're going to get into the top five and we're going to do 1984 versus 2021. Why"
01:12:16;01:12:25;"1984? I just said it because that was the year of the infamous harmonica gate Joker"
01:12:25;01:12:32;"Man performance. '84 also happens to be the year that I was born. So I'm fairly familiar."
01:12:32;01:12:37;"Actually, I don't even know. Am I familiar with it? I think so. What time of year is"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"it? So it's Jan. Okay. No, I wasn't even alive yet. January 84. I'm not going to know. What"
01:12:42;01:12:48;"time of year is it? I was still three months out from birth. So the number five song this"
01:12:48;01:13:06;"week in '84, Matthew Wilder, ""Break My Stride."" Oh, this is a good song."
01:13:06;01:13:34;"Oh, yeah, I know this song. Yeah, this song rules."
01:13:34;01:13:49;"Oh, that's Puff Daddy and Mace, ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down."" Yeah, ""Can't Nobody Hold Me"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"Down."""
01:13:50;01:14:04;"The production is so weak, but it totally works. The song is great. The singing is great."
01:14:04;01:14:15;"Who's Matthew Wilder? What's his story? I think he's kind of a one hit wonder. This"
01:14:15;01:14:21;"album is called ""I Don't Speak The Language."""
01:14:21;01:14:26;"It kind of seems like he was in a folk duo, and then he made this album, made one more,"
01:14:26;01:14:31;"and that was kind of it. Despite the downturn in his solo career, Wilder continued his career"
01:14:31;01:14:36;"in the music industry as a songwriter and as a record producer. Whoa, he produced ""Tragic"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Kingdom"" for No Doubt."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"That's huge."
01:14:39;01:14:43;"I also feel like that should be a bigger deal. It's like the ""Break My Stride"" dude produced"
01:14:43;01:14:47;"""Don't Speak,"" ""Spiderwebs,"" all those classics."
01:14:47;01:14:52;"I mean, that's the only Matthew Wilder song I know, but there is a continuity there with"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"No Doubt for sure."
01:14:54;01:15:01;"They both are into both white reggae. Oh, I like that on the Wikipedia it specifically"
01:15:01;01:15:06;"says the keyboard they were using was a Prophet 5. Classic."
01:15:06;01:15:11;"The lyrics are very strange. I feel like this is stuff that pop songs today never quite"
01:15:11;01:15:17;"have. It reminds me of like, you know, just like being at karaoke for some kind of weird"
01:15:17;01:15:21;"hit from the '80s, '70s or '80s, and the chorus is so straightforward. ""Ain't nothing gonna"
01:15:21;01:15:26;"break my stride. Nobody gonna slow me down. Oh no, I gotta keep moving."" But then like"
01:15:26;01:15:31;"that first verse, ""Last night I had the strangest dream. I sailed away to China in a little"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"rowboat to find ya. And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned. Didn't want no one"
01:15:36;01:15:41;"to hold you. What does that mean? And you said..."" I'm definitely not mad at it. It's"
01:15:41;01:15:46;"interesting, but it's just like big hit songs never have lyrics like that anymore. Just"
01:15:46;01:15:50;"like bizarre, impressionistic, dream-like, like that."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Where does it go from there? It goes..."
01:15:52;01:15:56;"Then the second verse is, ""You're on the road and now you pray at last. The road behind"
01:15:56;01:16:01;"was rocky, but now you're feeling cocky. You look at me and see your past. Is that the"
01:16:01;01:16:06;"reason why you're running so fast?"" And she said... Actually, that's kind of like interesting"
01:16:06;01:16:12;"to look at in this song. One would assume this upbeat song with the chorus, ""Nobody's"
01:16:12;01:16:17;"gonna break my stride,"" is the singer, you know, like a classic feel-good anthem, a fight"
01:16:17;01:16:21;"song. This was kind of like the fight song of the '80s in some ways."
01:16:21;01:16:28;"This would be such a sick song for a politician's campaign. ""Last night I had the strangest"
01:16:28;01:16:35;"dream."" Just that chorus, just... Congressman Longstreth coming out on stage, ""Ain't nobody"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"gonna break my stride."""
01:16:36;01:16:41;"I'm sure people don't want to think about him now, but it would be pretty Trump. Can"
01:16:41;01:16:48;"you just imagine at a rally, Trump rally in Montana, just blasting ""Break my stride."""
01:16:48;01:16:50;"He does his weird little arm dance to it."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"Oh, yeah."
01:16:51;01:16:56;"But anyway, so even though the lyrics of the song have that kind of fight song energy,"
01:16:56;01:17:01;"a classic believe in yourself, don't let anybody hold you down kind of energy, when you actually"
01:17:01;01:17:08;"look at it, the singer, let's call him Matthew Wilder, the narrator, is not the one who sang"
01:17:08;01:17:13;"the chorus. In the first verse that leads into it, he says, he's talking about this"
01:17:13;01:17:18;"woman or this person that he couldn't find in China. And you've said, ""Ain't nobody gonna"
01:17:18;01:17:25;"break my stride."" And now he's talking about another person who crossed a rocky path and"
01:17:25;01:17:31;"now is feeling cocky and moved past the narrator and ran right past them. And she said, ""Ain't"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"nothing gonna break my stride."""
01:17:32;01:17:39;"And then the bridge, which was kind of like a nice little surprising moment, is ""Never"
01:17:39;01:17:44;"let another girl like you work me over. Never let another girl like you drag me under. If"
01:17:44;01:17:48;"I meet another girl like you, I will tell her. Never want another girl like you have"
01:17:48;01:17:52;"to say, 'Oh.'"" Maybe he's taking it back at the end now."
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Yeah, the third chorus, the final chorus repeat is him."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Perhaps."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"So it goes from second person to first."
01:17:59;01:18:04;"And also, picture this. This is like the yuppie '80s. It's Reagan's America coming out of"
01:18:04;01:18:12;"the dark days of the '70s. Business is booming for some. A lot of hyper-ambitious yuppies"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"invading the big cities. Maybe he's like old hippie and he's kind of like checked out with"
01:18:16;01:18:21;"his culture and he's feeling like, ""Man, I got all these ambitious people just leaving"
01:18:21;01:18:28;"me in their dust. I fall in love with people and they say, 'You know what, Matthew? You're"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"not enough. You're going to slow me down.'"" I'm like, ""What? I thought we were having"
01:18:31;01:18:37;"a good time."" ""No, I'm focused on my career. I want to be with a dude making more money."
01:18:37;01:18:39;"You haven't even had a hit yet."""
01:18:39;01:18:43;"And so maybe in the end, he's reclaiming it as like, ""You know what? I'm not going to"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"let anybody break my stride either, but I'm going to do it in a kind vibe way because"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"I'm not an ambitious yuppie."""
01:18:48;01:18:52;"Yeah, he was almost 30 when this song came out."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"That's kind of poignant."
01:18:53;01:18:58;"Which, yeah, would have been kind of old for a musician in that era, for sure."
01:18:58;01:19:04;"Yeah, especially it's '84. Pop music's changed so much. He probably sits down with a Prophet"
01:19:04;01:19:10;"Five being like, ""Man, what can I do with this?"" Starts making a synth reggae new wave"
01:19:10;01:19:16;"song about feeling worked over by ambitious people."
01:19:16;01:19:17;"Yeah."
01:19:17;01:19:24;"All right, let's keep moving. The number five song right now. Oh, Doja Cat, ""Streets."" I"
01:19:24;01:19:28;"don't know this song."
01:19:28;01:19:49;"This kind of feels like a pop version of some early Twigs."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Some early what?"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"No, FKA Twigs."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"I mean, I've heard of her."
01:19:54;01:20:03;"In 2013, she was doing kind of like a vibe-y version, similar kind of melodies."
01:20:03;01:20:10;"I'm noticing that the notes for all these songs have information about the TikTok. The"
01:20:10;01:20:15;"Matthew Wilder was popular in January 2020 on TikTok."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Oh, that song got big on TikTok?"
01:20:17;01:20:23;"That's what the notes that Matt gave us say. And then this one, ""Streets"" by Doja Cat has"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"also been used in over 180,000 videos on TikTok."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"You know, this song will probably be on the top five again. We'd talk about it more. I"
01:20:29;01:20:34;"wonder what people did on TikTok to it. Doesn't immediately seem TikTokable."
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Why? Because it's so mellow?"
01:20:37;01:20:41;"Yeah, because it's kind of like mellow. The vocals are kind of like a little bit buried"
01:20:41;01:20:49;"in the mix. The number four song back in '84, Elton John. Big name. I guess that's why they"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"call it the blues."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"Their favorite of Trump's."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"Oh, yeah. Trump loves Elton John."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"This feels like late in Boogie Nights."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Yeah."
01:20:59;01:21:05;"Just like Dirk Diggles is doing like a ton of coke off the glass coffee table."
01:21:05;01:21:09;"I mean, ""Break My Stride"" is super deep in a Boogie Nights vibe too."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Totally."
01:21:10;01:21:29;"You know what? A friend of the show, Aaron Olsen, brought this to my attention after"
01:21:29;01:21:37;"he listened to the ""Yarl"" episode. I feel like Elton John got left out of the conversation"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"in terms of proto-Yarl, which I could see."
01:21:40;01:21:47;"Yeah, there's something close. He doesn't do the ""R"" thing. I also got a DM. I'll have"
01:21:47;01:21:51;"to look up the person's name that was shared on Twitter. But it was a great question. Does"
01:21:51;01:21:55;"share Yarl? And I think the answer is unequivocally yes."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"But I could see Elton too."
01:21:57;01:22:15;"It's funny. I mean, obviously, when you listen to it, the production is 80s. But that truly,"
01:22:15;01:22:20;"just in terms of the song and obviously the piano playing and all that, it really could"
01:22:20;01:22:23;"have come out any time in Elton John's career."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"Like if that was 1971."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"Oh, yeah. That could have been a nice first record."
01:22:25;01:22:29;"Yeah, that could have been a nice first record. In fact, without hearing, not being able to"
01:22:29;01:22:34;"easily recall what the production sounded like, if you just sang me that song, I'd be"
01:22:34;01:22:38;"like, ""Yeah, that could have been on his first record."" Or even if it was like, ""Yeah, that"
01:22:38;01:22:42;"was on his kind of return to form, late 90s record."" I don't know."
01:22:42;01:22:45;"He could have had that music sitting around for years. Who knows?"
01:22:45;01:22:50;"Oh, yeah. That's definitely a good point. Maybe it does have its roots in the 70s."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"This is kind of interesting. Bernie Taupin saying he regrets one lyric in the song."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"What's that?"
01:22:56;01:23:01;"""The whole loving you more than I love life itself is something I would never say now."
01:23:01;01:23:05;"It's kind of a crass sentiment and totally false. It's quite another thing to love someone"
01:23:05;01:23:11;"deeply with your whole heart without stooping to this kind of lie. I loathe giving songwriting"
01:23:11;01:23:16;"advice, but where I push, I'd say, 'Never say you love someone more than life or that"
01:23:16;01:23:21;"you die for someone in a song.' It's just such a disservice to your own spirit. I'd"
01:23:21;01:23:26;"like to think that I'd laid down my life for my children, but until you're faced with that"
01:23:26;01:23:32;"reality, it's kind of a moot point. Rambling, I know, but relative nonetheless."""
01:23:32;01:23:33;"Interesting."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"Wow, he's really beating himself up over that."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"I wonder why. Yeah, I wonder if like-"
01:23:37;01:23:42;"I mean, it's a cliche. Like, ""I love you more than life itself. I would die for you."" Yeah,"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"I mean-"
01:23:43;01:23:47;"I think he's 100%, although I think he- I mean, and Bernie Taupin is a great lyricist"
01:23:47;01:23:53;"for anybody who's not familiar. He wrote, basically, with a few exceptions, he was Elton's"
01:23:53;01:24:00;"lyricist partner the whole time. Very unusual story, a lyricist and a piano player/singer"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"meeting and forming a team."
01:24:02;01:24:09;"Well, I watched the Elton John movie on an airplane, I guess, last- or 2019, and I don't"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"know if this is true. You read the Elton John book, right?"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Yeah, and I watched the movie, too."
01:24:14;01:24:18;"And it seemed like they were paired together, like really kind of classic Tin Pan Alley"
01:24:18;01:24:22;"style. Like, Elton's like, ""I'm a songwriter."" And someone paired them, and they didn't even"
01:24:22;01:24:27;"know each other. It wasn't like they organically met through this music scene."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Oh, yeah. Well, I was about to say that I thought-"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Is that true?"
01:24:30;01:24:35;"Yeah, maybe the music publisher put them together. Either that or a want ad kind of thing, but"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"it's definitely not like they were buddies."
01:24:37;01:24:41;"I mean, that makes their partnership even more incredible, that they actually hit it"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"off. If you're just randomly paired with someone, it's like, what are the odds that you're going"
01:24:44;01:24:49;"to be simpatico in terms of the creativity?"
01:24:49;01:24:54;"Robert Hunter and Jerry, Elton and Bernie Taupin. Those are kind of like the two best"
01:24:54;01:25:00;"lyricists, especially when the person is a pure lyricist. I mean, I know we've brought"
01:25:00;01:25:05;"this up on TC all the time, but in pop music and a lot of forms of writing, it's very standard"
01:25:05;01:25:09;"that one person might make some music and somebody writes a melody and lyrics on top"
01:25:09;01:25:14;"of it, which weirdly makes more sense to me because it's like, all right, you wrote the"
01:25:14;01:25:18;"melody and lyrics because you heard some music and you had to write a song on top of it."
01:25:18;01:25:23;"But the idea of all you have are the words. Or maybe sometimes the person might come and"
01:25:23;01:25:30;"just be like, I have this song, it's like, how about, I guess that's why they call it"
01:25:30;01:25:35;"the blues. It's just an unusual way to put things together. But I guess a few people"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"have that kind of synergy."
01:25:36;01:25:41;"Well, in the movie, and maybe this is just the movie, but it seemed like Bernie Taupin"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"was just handing him full lyrics pages."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Handing him poetry. Yeah, that is what happens."
01:25:45;01:25:51;"And then he would just sit down at the piano and just like, ""It's a little bit funny, this"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"feeling inside."""
01:25:53;01:25:58;"I think that's how they do it because Elton, yeah, Elton obviously has this real genius"
01:25:58;01:26:02;"for chords and melody. But it's just funny to think Bernie is just sat down with his"
01:26:02;01:26:09;"notebook. It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. Just like so dry."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"Yeah."
01:26:10;01:26:14;"And just having no idea where it's going to go. But actually, I want to look at the chorus"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"of this because I've always been, I don't know, I know this song, but I don't know it"
01:26:17;01:26:22;"super well. Of course, you always remember the chorus. I guess that's why they call it"
01:26:22;01:26:27;"the blues and it's the title. Because I was always wondering, do they really explain why"
01:26:27;01:26:31;"it's called the blues? The first verse, ""Don't wish it away, don't look at it like it's forever."
01:26:31;01:26:35;"Between you and me, I can honestly say that things will only get better. And while I'm"
01:26:35;01:26:40;"away, dust out the demons inside and it won't be long before you and me run to the place"
01:26:40;01:26:45;"in our hearts where we hide."" I'm guessing, like talking to somebody who's kind of in"
01:26:45;01:26:50;"a depressive phase and saying like, ""Listen, you got to ride this thing out. It sucks."""
01:26:50;01:26:51;"We'll get through it."
01:26:51;01:26:56;"""All I can really say is things will get better. You got to deal with your demons. We'll get"
01:26:56;01:27:01;"back to having fun again."" And then the chorus is, ""And I guess that's why they call it the"
01:27:01;01:27:07;"blues. Time on my hands should be time spent with you. Laughing like children, living like"
01:27:07;01:27:12;"lovers, rolling like thunder under the covers. And I guess that's why they call it the blues."""
01:27:12;01:27:15;"Wait, what do you mean, ""I guess that's why they call it the blues?"" See, that would make"
01:27:15;01:27:22;"sense if somebody was like, ""When I'm depressed, it's weird, but I wear all blue clothes."""
01:27:22;01:27:24;"I guess that's why they call it the blues. Makes sense."
01:27:24;01:27:30;"Or like, ""When I'm depressed, I'm just sitting on the couch watching episodes of The Sopranos"
01:27:30;01:27:36;"eating chunky monkey, ordering Domino's."" You're bummed out and you're lethargic and"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"you're not doing anything."
01:27:37;01:27:42;"Yeah, but that's like creating a definition with the word itself. You know what I mean?"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I don't know if I do know what you mean. What do you mean?"
01:27:44;01:27:51;"We know that people use the phrase ""the blues"" to mean depressed. But imagine a little kid"
01:27:51;01:27:56;"said to you, ""What's the matter, Mr. Longstreth?"" And you said, ""Listen, Frankie, I just got"
01:27:56;01:28:00;"the blues."" And then the little kid said, ""The blues?"" You said, ""Yeah, you know, the"
01:28:00;01:28:06;"blues. I'm kind of sad."" And the kid said, ""Why do they call it the blues?"" You'd be"
01:28:06;01:28:13;"like, ""I guess, you know, because you're feeling blue."" And the kid would be like, ""Yeah, right,"
01:28:13;01:28:17;"but why do they call it feeling blue?"" ""Well, you know, because you got the blues."" I'm"
01:28:17;01:28:24;"sure the definition has something to do with, you know what, rather than try to break down"
01:28:24;01:28:29;"the song and pick over the work of great men like Ellen and Bernie. How about Seinfeld?"
01:28:29;01:28:34;"We get a number crunch. Why do they call it the blues? Because I don't think the answer"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"is in the song."
01:28:35;01:28:40;"Guys, the name of this great American music probably originated with the 17th century"
01:28:40;01:28:46;"English expression, ""the blue devils,"" for the intense visual hallucinations that can"
01:28:46;01:28:52;"accompany severe alcohol withdrawal. Shortened over time to ""the blues,"" it came to mean"
01:28:52;01:28:59;"a state of agitation or depression. That is via Huffington Post's ""Why is the Blues Called"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"the Blues?"" January 4th, 2013."
01:29:02;01:29:06;"Now, that would have been an interesting set of lyrics."
01:29:06;01:29:13;"Okay, well, you know, Elton did famously struggle with addiction issues. Maybe it's not that"
01:29:13;01:29:18;"far away if we go back to that first verse, ""And while I'm away, dust out the demons inside,"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"the blue devils."""
01:29:19;01:29:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:29:20;01:29:27;"Yeah, right. Because that would... Again, I hate to hold these guys up to my excruciatingly"
01:29:27;01:29:34;"rigorous logic, which I rarely follow myself. But it would make sense if somebody said,"
01:29:34;01:29:39;"like, if we wrote a song and the verse was kind of like, ""As I try to stop drinking,"
01:29:39;01:29:46;"I have these crazy visions, and I feel myself being tortured by a series of blue devils"
01:29:46;01:29:51;"making me miserable."" And then you say, ""Huh, I guess that's why they call it the blues."""
01:29:51;01:29:56;"You'd actually be like linking things together, your strange hallucinations of blue devils."
01:29:56;01:30:02;"Yeah, blue devils is a funny concept. Like, that's the University of Kentucky, right?"
01:30:02;01:30:03;"Duke."
01:30:03;01:30:08;"Oh, that's Duke? Wait, so what's the University of Kentucky? They're blue. They just big blue?"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Wildcats. They are blue."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"Who's big blue?"
01:30:11;01:30:15;"I believe that's Kentucky. But they're the Wildcats."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Oh, they're the Wildcats and they're also big blue."
01:30:17;01:30:21;"I wonder if the blue devils are connected to devil in a blue dress."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Also IBM."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"It's also a Vampire Weekend song."
01:30:25;01:30:29;"It's also a Vampire Weekend song. I've been sent a lot of big blues. There's like a regional"
01:30:29;01:30:36;"soda called Big Blue. Stuff like that. But wait, so Duke is the blue devils?"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"Yes, and the University of Kentucky's fan base is Big Blue Nation."
01:30:40;01:30:46;"Okay. Because I grew up in New Jersey where our beloved hockey team, the Devils, has a"
01:30:46;01:30:51;"very straightforward etymology. Comes from the New Jersey devil, who's a devil who lives"
01:30:51;01:30:57;"down in the Pine Barrens in central South Jersey. We hate him. He'd make life miserable"
01:30:57;01:31:02;"for people. And I think it was kind of like reclaiming something to name our beloved hockey"
01:31:02;01:31:09;"team after this devilish figure who did so many terrible things in the name of Satan."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"It's cool that they named the team after him."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Yeah, there's not enough like weird Satanic mythology."
01:31:14;01:31:17;"Yeah, like the Seattle Bigfoots."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"Well now there's the Seattle Kraken. Were you aware of that?"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"Wait, really? No."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"They have a new hockey team that's called the Kraken."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Wait, what is the Kraken again?"
01:31:26;01:31:33;"It's like a giant squid that would like take down ships in the 18th century. So that'll"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"be kind of tight. Maybe one day there'll be a Stanley Cup final. I don't know if the divisions"
01:31:36;01:31:41;"are right, but if they are right, that could be the Devils versus the Kraken."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"That would rule."
01:31:42;01:31:46;"They should do that one on Halloween. They should rearrange the schedule, do a Halloween"
01:31:46;01:31:52;"Stanley Cup Kraken versus Devils. Okay, sorry to dwell on this, but Seinfeld, I need you"
01:31:52;01:31:58;"to go one more layer deep into the inception. Why are they called the Blue Devils in Duke?"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"Is it because they're depressed?"
01:32:01;01:32:08;"The name comes from the French Les Diables Bleus, or the Blue Devils, which was the nickname"
01:32:08;01:32:16;"given during World War I to the Chasseurs Alpins, the French Alpine Light Infantry Battalion."
01:32:16;01:32:22;"Duke joined the Southern Conference in 1929 and left in '53 to become a founder of the"
01:32:22;01:32:28;"Atlantic Coast Conference. Does that make sense?"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"What's going on over there, Jake?"
01:32:30;01:32:31;"Just dropped a dumbbell."
01:32:31;01:32:35;"Oh, are you getting a pump in during the top five?"
01:32:35;01:32:39;"Just doing a light five pounder with my left arm."
01:32:39;01:32:44;"Speaking of why they call things their names, we call it the top five because generally"
01:32:44;01:32:50;"speaking we each have a five pounder in each hand getting a light pump on. It's incidental"
01:32:50;01:32:54;"that we go through five songs. That's actually a very strange coincidence."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Yeah."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"I'm just getting a real light five pump. But that Duke story, so you're saying like"
01:32:59;01:33:06;"in a college in North Carolina named their sports teams after a French World War I legion."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"I guess it kind of makes sense."
01:33:07;01:33:10;"I'm going to call it, guys. We're too deep at this point."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"We're too many layers of inception."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"I'm pulling this out."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"All right."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"You know I want to, but I'm in too deep."
01:33:18;01:33:25;"The number four song this week on the top five, Morgan Wallen, Wasted on You. We listened"
01:33:25;01:33:34;"to this song seven summers when we did the country streaming chart top five. Wallen was"
01:33:34;01:33:37;"also suggested as a country artist who could cover the worst margarita of my life."
01:33:37;01:33:42;"Ezra, how's that going with getting the worst margarita of my life?"
01:33:42;01:33:49;"I got to get on that. I'm going to make a note right now."
01:33:49;01:34:18;"Interesting. Trap country."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"This song is great."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Not bad. I'm feeling it."
01:34:20;01:34:36;"I did something fresh with like pretty like tried and true country music jokes. All this"
01:34:36;01:34:40;"time and all this money, all these stories I don't owe you, honey. All of these miles"
01:34:40;01:34:49;"on the Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them. Yeah, that puts a smile on my face when he"
01:34:49;01:34:55;"hits that. All of these miles on the Chevy and prayers in a pew. Like it's all such classic"
01:34:55;01:35:01;"countries. He mentioned the church, mentioned the Chevy, but it's still like kind of like"
01:35:01;01:35:06;"a novel way of putting it together. All this bull he did, he wasted on you."
01:35:06;01:35:11;"And the guitar is doing this like half step up, like walk up thing, which is not very"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"country."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Guys, what's going on with the Florida Georgia line? I feel like we haven't heard from them."
01:35:15;01:35:19;"Yeah, they've been real quiet. We might have to just do a catch up sometime soon. Just"
01:35:19;01:35:24;"be like, because, you know, I'm sure they're out there crushing it. They maybe just didn't"
01:35:24;01:35:29;"happen to have a single in the top five. It'd be great to do an FGL catch up."
01:35:29;01:35:32;"I also really enjoyed our country deep dive. I think-"
01:35:32;01:35:37;"Yeah, we should do that more often. We should maybe do that like every fourth TC."
01:35:37;01:35:42;"Yeah, I just answered my own question. Florida Georgia line's next album comes out February"
01:35:42;01:35:47;"12th, 2021. It's called Life Rolls On. I think this might be their year."
01:35:47;01:35:54;"Why don't we try to get them on album release week, FGL. Matt, what do you think?"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"I believe they're part of the Apple Music family. So I think we can-"
01:35:57;01:36:05;"You heard it here first, folks. We're trying to get FGL on the program. TC, we rarely go"
01:36:05;01:36:13;"out to guests, but sometimes we just get that feeling. Okay, the number three song in 1984,"
01:36:13;01:36:18;"The Romantics, Talking In Your Sleep. Do I know this song? Know this song, Jake?"
01:36:18;01:36:19;"Yeah."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"You know it."
01:36:21;01:36:44;"Did somebody sample this? Oh, yeah. A lot of people sampled this. The Weeknd, Snoop"
01:36:44;01:36:59;"Dogg, Kris Kross. This feels very like 80s movie where they have to go into a club for"
01:36:59;01:37:04;"some reason and just like a very weird random assortment of people is kind of just like"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"jerkily dancing."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"Yeah. Not one of my favorites. That's cool."
01:37:08;01:37:14;"Yeah, you know, it's like solid. That bass line's undeniable. But now we're at the number"
01:37:14;01:37:26;"three song of 2021. This is Lil Baby with On Me. This is what Lil Baby said about this"
01:37:26;01:37:30;"song. I had an amazing year, but it was still kind of like a little minute since I dropped"
01:37:30;01:37:35;"something. On Me is just a little vibe, like a female vibe. Just something I made in the"
01:37:35;01:37:39;"studio sitting in the house kind of bored."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"OK. Very cool."
01:37:40;01:37:43;"I wonder what he means by female vibe."
01:37:43;01:37:49;"Yeah. Like, is it for the ladies or is it is he being diminutive about saying that it's"
01:37:49;01:37:50;"not?"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"Maybe it's either. Maybe it's just that he was getting in touch with his feminine side"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"and like either you hear it or you don't."
01:37:56;01:38:01;"Just making songs, not really working on an album or any project. It's just something"
01:38:01;01:38:06;"to stick out there. Well, that's really inspiring. I don't know. She's sitting around bored,"
01:38:06;01:38:12;"made a song. I just thought I'd put it out. I mean, I'm not mad at that. Like, I'm not"
01:38:12;01:38:19;"mad at that as like an idea, but it's just like a funny. It's a funny thing to advertise."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"But you know, I respect the honesty."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"This is a standalone single."
01:38:23;01:38:27;"Yeah, it's kind of old school. Just a band putting on a single. Not going to be on a"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"record."
01:38:28;01:38:31;"Well, actually, the streaming era, people are even more into it because there's like"
01:38:31;01:38:36;"a school of thoughts like, keep those numbers up."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"Right."
01:38:37;01:38:43;"Well, fellas, everybody go play that for the females in your life. See what they think."
01:38:43;01:38:48;"I'm genuinely curious about what Lil Baby meant by that. What's interesting about it"
01:38:48;01:38:52;"to me, and I'm sure there's something that I don't know or I don't have the context for."
01:38:52;01:38:55;"Of course, I'm familiar with this idea of being like, oh, this is something for the"
01:38:55;01:39:01;"ladies. But historically, the cliches of like what the female vibe would be, would"
01:39:01;01:39:06;"be like a slow jam or something. You picture like a hair metal band doing their power belt"
01:39:06;01:39:12;"like, this is a little something for the females. Or, you know, like there's always been like"
01:39:12;01:39:18;"tough guys, whether they're rappers or like, you know, metal dudes. They have these moments"
01:39:18;01:39:23;"where they do a romantic song for the women. So I wonder if what he meant by it was that"
01:39:23;01:39:28;"the vibe was like soft, literally softer, because that song is still like kind of hard"
01:39:28;01:39:32;"in a way or if he meant like, you know, maybe next time we'll pour over the lyrics more."
01:39:32;01:39:36;"Maybe there's something like romantic happening in the lyrics. Anyway,"
01:39:36;01:39:41;"It does make me think just as we're kind of analyzing the word female makes me think of"
01:39:41;01:39:49;"my other favorite Thin Lizzy lyric, which is, I'm just a cowboy lonesome on the trail."
01:39:49;01:39:52;"Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Phil could write a couplet."
01:39:54;01:40:04;"Yeah, they have so many good songs. The number two song this week in 1984, Culture Club Karma"
01:40:04;01:40:17;"Chameleon. I was actually jamming this song a couple months ago. Great song."
01:40:17;01:40:21;"I made a playlist a while ago, like 80 songs I really like."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Yeah, and this is on there."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Oh yeah."
01:40:25;01:40:33;"Would you say I'm a man without conviction?"
01:40:33;01:40:43;"I'm a man who doesn't know how to settle a contradiction."
01:40:43;01:40:49;"You come and go. You come and go."
01:40:49;01:40:59;"Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon. You come and go. You come and go."
01:40:59;01:41:09;"Love will be easy if your colors were like my dreams. Red, gold and green. Red, gold and green."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"It's funny, I actually got back into this song like a few months ago. I was thinking about it."
01:41:13;01:41:18;"And I don't know what I thought the lyric was, but I never realized that he was just naming colors at the end."
01:41:18;01:41:23;"Red, gold and green. That's such a cool, weird lyric."
01:41:23;01:41:28;"And isn't that the Jamaican flag? Isn't that like the reggae?"
01:41:28;01:41:35;"Yeah, and maybe black. It's the flag of Ethiopia. Red, yellow and green."
01:41:35;01:41:40;"Oh, is it? I think of red, gold and green as a classic reggae color combo."
01:41:40;01:41:50;"Well, I guess those are considered the... There's those colors, then there's red, black and green, but they're considered an African colors."
01:41:50;01:41:56;"Yeah. What? This song is trippy. Like the lyrics are trippy."
01:41:56;01:42:02;"Red, gold and green. Red, gold and green."
01:42:02;01:42:12;"Every day is like survival. You're my lover, not my rival."
01:42:12;01:42:24;"Every day is like survival. You're my lover, not my rival."
01:42:24;01:42:30;"I love that there's a harmonica in this too. Yeah, this is such a good song."
01:42:30;01:42:35;"Boy George claims that the rest of the band thought the song was too country when he played it for them."
01:42:35;01:42:40;"I guess I can hear this as like a country two-step."
01:42:40;01:42:44;"Yeah, if he was just playing on acoustic guitar."
01:42:44;01:42:55;"Interestingly, Matt found that before the rainbow, the red, gold and green were the... Those were the pride colors."
01:42:55;01:43:00;"Really? Oh, wow. Oh, I never heard of this. Yeah, red and green are also two colors."
01:43:00;01:43:10;"And then I think on a deeper level, red and green are also two colors that chameleons can change into if you're getting more zoological about it or whatever."
01:43:10;01:43:15;"But I think that, yeah, that's something. Chameleons are truly amazing beasts."
01:43:15;01:43:20;"Watch some videos of chameleon changing colors. Really amazing."
01:43:20;01:43:29;"This song is cool. Yeah, he's saying here the song is about the terrible fear of alienation that people have, the fear of standing up for one thing."
01:43:29;01:43:36;"It's about trying to not suck up to everybody. Wow. So he's just like, be true to yourself, man."
01:43:36;01:43:43;"This is like very poetic. Yeah. I've always been like kind of meaning to go deeper on Boy George."
01:43:43;01:43:55;"Definitely seems like a fascinating artist. But yeah, there's something about like this big fun hit song where I'm a man without conviction."
01:43:55;01:44:00;"Yeah. I'm a man who doesn't know how to sell a contradiction. You come and go, you come and go."
01:44:00;01:44:07;"Yeah, like there really is something about that in this moment when like culture was changing so much."
01:44:07;01:44:17;"Think about like Thatcher being prime minister in the UK and just like these big shifts and kind of like what some people in the country believed in and how the country
operated."
01:44:17;01:44:24;"And the idea of having like this guy singing, I'm a man without conviction. Like, I don't know kind of what to make of all this."
01:44:24;01:44:32;"And even the idea of a karma chameleon, it sounds so kind of like fun, like something a little kid would make up. Karma chameleon."
01:44:32;01:44:39;"But I guess you could actually interpret it as like, again, somebody without conviction, like somebody with no values."
01:44:39;01:44:46;"They act like they're, you know, going with the flow of karma, but they're constantly like changing their colors."
01:44:46;01:44:51;"So they're like punishing you one moment, then the next moment, they're getting punished."
01:44:51;01:44:58;"Like, it's almost like describing like, yeah, a valueless world. And then you're my lover, not my rival."
01:44:58;01:45:08;"That actually is really interesting and a kind of modern sentiment. The idea of like, that just doesn't really sound like something somebody would say in the 60s."
01:45:08;01:45:14;"Obviously, there's so much room to explore and like the relationships between lovers."
01:45:14;01:45:22;"It's the, you know, the number one theme of songwriting, whether it's a positive or negative or coming together, coming apart."
01:45:22;01:45:31;"But specifically to say, you're my lover, not my rival. I don't know, to me, that makes me think about just like money and like the 80s and yuppies."
01:45:31;01:45:40;"Like, of all the issues that people have in relationships, the idea of being like rivals. I don't know. I can totally see like the, I often go this route."
01:45:40;01:45:46;"But like, you know, some kind of like modern philosopher talking about like the breakdown of like community and social relations."
01:45:46;01:45:54;"And everybody being in competition with everybody else in the 80s is like, obviously iconic decade for that."
01:45:54;01:46:05;"Even within the love, the loving relationship of the pop song, the concept of rivalry enters who will be left behind in the new world of Margaret Thatcher's England."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"That's my interpretation."
01:46:06;01:46:10;"Karma Chameleon was one of the first songs about neoliberalism."
01:46:10;01:46:21;"Basically, we need Adam Curtis deep dive on Karma Chameleon. It's also worth anybody's listening, like go back and look at like their first few album covers."
01:46:21;01:46:31;"They look like those like, like Tiger Beat magazine covers, where like, they're so like posy. They look like magazines, basically."
01:46:31;01:46:43;"Especially the second one where it's like Big Boy George and the other guys and like circles. They're like very colorful. And there's just like something I would
almost say that they have that same mix of like,"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Oh my god, yeah, this is crazy. This cover."
01:46:45;01:47:02;"Yeah, they're sick. I would say that the first two Culture Club albums almost have that same strange mix of like 80s slickness and pop cleanness, but also weird sadness."
01:47:02;01:47:09;"And you could say the sadness of neoliberalism as like vaporwave and like the vaporwave aesthetic of like our time."
01:47:09;01:47:19;"Obviously, they're not literally doing the vaporwave thing of a bust of a Greek statue and plus Jap. Although actually, does one of the covers have Japanese on it?"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"Has some Japanese characters or something?"
01:47:21;01:47:28;"Oh, yeah, yeah. The Color by Numbers album has some Japanese character or some Japanese or Chinese or something. Yeah."
01:47:28;01:47:32;"This is vaporwave, folks. I mean, that's the funny thing about vaporwave."
01:47:32;01:47:35;"Wait, I'm sorry, dude. I don't know what vaporwave is."
01:47:35;01:47:44;"Honestly, we got to save it for another. You'll know when you see it. We'll save that for another one. We're about five years late to be talking about it anyway."
01:47:44;01:47:55;"But anybody who knows of vaporwave is obviously a lot of vaporwave is just kind of recreating the contradictions that were already there in the music and culture of the
80s."
01:47:55;01:48:06;"Okay, are we at number one yet? Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Number two. Number two song in 2021 is SZA Good Days."
01:48:06;01:48:14;"SZA is great. So we're going to do her the honor of not talking about the song. And we're not going to grind it out."
01:48:14;01:48:17;"All right, everybody listen to the new SZA song. We're not going to grind it out."
01:48:17;01:48:26;"Okay, number one song. Number one song, 1984, January 84. Yes, Owner of a Lonely Heart."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"Plow. I was not expecting that."
01:48:28;01:48:40;"I've always been so struck by that beginning. Because it's like a breakbeat. So it sounds like 90s hip hop, but it's not actually part of the song."
01:48:40;01:48:44;"It's just the intro. Like, obviously, yeah, like pure 80s."
01:48:44;01:48:58;"It really sounds like Sting on this song. Oh, yeah."
01:48:58;01:49:09;"This song has always tripped me out. Just the fact that it's the same band who did like, 70s stuff."
01:49:09;01:49:17;"Exactly. It's one of the prime examples of like, truly out there 70s artists making 80s pop."
01:49:17;01:49:28;"To be fair, this is still like very forward thinking pop music. It would have been interesting if they used this aesthetic and still made 23 minute songs."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"Yeah."
01:49:31;01:49:43;"All right. I mean, we left it all out on the field. By the time we got to the number three song on this top five. It was backloaded. It's a backloaded top five."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"We didn't pace ourselves."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"I'm interested in this song. I've seen people reference this on."
01:49:49;01:49:58;"We needed to save up for this song a little bit. This is the biggest song ever."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Now, what does that mean exactly?"
01:50:00;01:50:03;"It's bigger and better than any song you've ever heard in your life."
01:50:03;01:50:06;"It goes ""driver's license"" and then ""hey Jude""."
01:50:06;01:50:21;"Yeah, there's a few things in between it. Yeah. ""driver's license"". Hit the elevator down button. Get in. It's going down. Floors are passing."
01:50:21;01:50:24;"Hey Jude."
01:50:24;01:50:30;"My understanding is that it's streamed more in the first few days than any song ever on the streaming services."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"Gotcha."
01:50:34;01:50:37;"I'm not sure."
01:50:37;01:50:44;"And you're probably with that blonde girl who always made me doubt."
01:50:44;01:50:50;"She's so much older than me. She's everything I'm insecure about."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"Yet today I drove through the summers."
01:50:53;01:51:00;"How could I ever love someone else?"
01:51:00;01:51:10;"And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one."
01:51:10;01:51:20;"And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone."
01:51:20;01:51:27;"Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me."
01:51:27;01:51:34;"You said forever now I drive alone past your street."
01:51:34;01:51:43;"And all my friends are tired of hearing how much I miss you but I kind of feel sorry for them."
01:51:43;01:51:46;"Oh, also she's actually 17."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"Wow, that's cool."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"She keeps saying ""the suburbs""."
01:51:51;01:51:56;"Do you think this was written pre-quarantine or in quarantine?"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"Definitely in quarantine."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"They weren't sitting on this."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"Well, maybe she could have had the idea before quarantine but they weren't sitting on this."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"It just doesn't seem like the thing that she's saying she's doing."
01:52:06;01:52:09;"I don't know. It just doesn't..."
01:52:09;01:52:13;"I don't know. It strikes me as like a pre-quarantine kind of thing."
01:52:13;01:52:17;"But let's imagine that you're still in high school."
01:52:17;01:52:22;"There's probably a lot of just aimless driving during quarantine."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"Just like, ""I swear I will not get out of the car."""
01:52:25;01:52:29;"""No, look, I'm not going anywhere."""
01:52:29;01:52:33;"That's got to be one of the worst ages to go through quarantine at."
01:52:33;01:52:37;"Probably kids are just like, ""Alright, you can go for a drive."""
01:52:37;01:52:42;"""You can go drive past your ex-boyfriend's house. That's okay. Just do not get out of the car."""
01:52:42;01:52:49;"I like what she says here. She says, ""Putting all those feelings into a song made everything so much clearer and simpler."""
01:52:49;01:52:54;"""And at the end of the day, I think that's the whole purpose of songwriting."""
01:52:54;01:52:59;"I like that she's really going for it there with saying, ""This is the purpose of art."""
01:52:59;01:53:02;"Which I agree with in a broad sense."
01:53:02;01:53:08;"Art should make things clearer and make the world make a little more sense, hopefully."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"It's cool that she has such a clear mission statement there."
01:53:12;01:53:21;"Ironically, I think you can say that sometimes even very obscure, hard to understand art"
01:53:21;01:53:25;"makes the world clearer in a sense, too."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"You know what I mean?"
01:53:27;01:53:34;"Because obviously, think about Robert Pollard or somebody whose lyrics are not simple statements."
01:53:34;01:53:40;"But in a way, even just putting all that energy into a three or four minute song"
01:53:40;01:53:47;"can sometimes still reduce a complicated feeling into a vibe or something."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"In her song, she's..."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"It's very literal, yeah."
01:53:50;01:53:55;"Yeah, I'm saying even without being literal, I still can agree with that statement about"
01:53:55;01:54:02;"making complicated feelings simple and clearer, even if you're not coming up with a straightforward symbol."
01:54:02;01:54:07;"Like, driving past your house in the suburbs and missing you,"
01:54:07;01:54:11;"that symbolizes our whole crazy relationship or something."
01:54:11;01:54:15;"Well, she's saying she's trying to put those feelings in her own head,"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"trying to crystallize those feelings."
01:54:17;01:54:20;"So yeah, you could be writing really abstract lyrics, but..."
01:54:20;01:54:26;"Yeah, it might not communicate universally to your entire audience, but to you it might give a sense of..."
01:54:26;01:54:30;"You're creating a vessel for complex thoughts and feelings."
01:54:30;01:54:34;"And whether it's a straightforward lyric or even an abstract work of art,"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"it's still like a vessel, and now it's like a thing."
01:54:37;01:54:43;"And at least for you, as the creator, it now can represent something that was previously"
01:54:43;01:54:47;"not simple or clear, it's now in a shape."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"And if it means something to other people, even better."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Yeah, it's a new thought."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Yeah."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"It's a pretty song."
01:54:54;01:54:58;"If you played that for me, I guess I'm not good at that."
01:54:58;01:55:01;"I wouldn't have called that the biggest song ever."
01:55:01;01:55:06;"But I wonder if there's something about it that just feels real"
01:55:06;01:55:10;"to people who just got their driver's licenses."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"Oh, and I guess we were kind of like... I'm missing some of the details."
01:55:13;01:55:17;"It opens with, ""I got my driver's license last week, just like we always talked about,"
01:55:17;01:55:20;"because you were so excited for me to finally drive up to your house."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"But today I drove through the suburbs crying because you weren't around."""
01:55:23;01:55:26;"Okay, so actually, that's like great country song writing."
01:55:26;01:55:31;"Just to be like... Honestly, it kind of connects with Morgan Wallen."
01:55:31;01:55:35;"All those wasted miles I put on my Chevy."
01:55:35;01:55:41;"Just like when the reality didn't meet up with the expectation."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"That's some real life s***."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"I wonder if she's a fan of Arcade Fire."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"That crossed my mind with the suburbs."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"I initially thought of it because she kept returning to the word ""the suburbs."""
01:55:51;01:55:55;"But also, when that drum comes in, like..."
01:55:55;01:55:58;"And it's just like... Something about the building,"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"emotional earnestness and intensity,"
01:56:00;01:56:05;"reminded me of that straining,"
01:56:05;01:56:09;"totally going for it, emotional rock music."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"I totally see your point."
01:56:11;01:56:17;"Although those vibes have also been mediated through so many other iterations on the way."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"I can see her being like, ""Oh, totally."""
01:56:19;01:56:22;"I mean, when I first thought of the suburbs,"
01:56:22;01:56:26;"I actually grew up in a Manhattan high-rise."
01:56:26;01:56:28;"I don't have a driver's license."
01:56:28;01:56:32;"But this image of these weird people who live in the suburbs driving around,"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"it always haunted me."
01:56:34;01:56:37;"It would have been cool if she had named the suburbs."
01:56:37;01:56:41;"If it was like Van Nuys or Westchester County or whatever."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Maybe it wouldn't have connected as big."
01:56:43;01:56:46;"If the song was just called Van Nuys."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Greater Milwaukee area."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"Yeah, name-checking suburbs of Milwaukee."
01:56:50;01:56:53;"That would be cool."
01:56:53;01:56:55;"But yeah, it's funny."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"By the standards of a lot of pop music,"
01:56:57;01:57:01;"even just the fact that she says the suburbs already is weirdly specific."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Yeah."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"You know what's interesting?"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Maybe, okay, here's something."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Maybe she's a showbiz kid."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Maybe she's been acting forever."
01:57:09;01:57:13;"Maybe she grew up in LA."
01:57:13;01:57:16;"LA is a pretty suburban city, but whatever."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"It's still technically a city."
01:57:17;01:57:21;"Maybe she grew up in LA, downtown Hollywood."
01:57:21;01:57:27;"She was always shooting on a soundstage in Burbank and that kind of stuff."
01:57:27;01:57:29;"Maybe she did have this boyfriend,"
01:57:29;01:57:32;"and he lived out in Rancho Cucamonga."
01:57:32;01:57:36;"For her, that really did feel like, ""Whoa, you're out there."""
01:57:36;01:57:40;"My world goes about as far as Burbank."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"You're another 45 minutes to an hour east on the 210."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"He lives in Downey."
01:57:46;01:57:48;"Oh, that's real deep."
01:57:48;01:57:52;"If you lived in the suburbs and your ex lived in the suburbs too,"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"and you drove to their house, you wouldn't say,"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"""And I drove through the suburbs."""
01:57:56;01:57:58;"No, yeah, you wouldn't say that."
01:57:58;01:58:03;"Maybe she is a city girl, and she had this boyfriend."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"That actually makes--you know what?"
01:58:05;01:58:06;"This makes a lot of sense."
01:58:06;01:58:09;"I understand the New York version a little bit better,"
01:58:09;01:58:12;"just because New York is like, ""The city is so the city,"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"and the suburbs are so the suburbs."""
01:58:14;01:58:16;"That actually is some real [expletive] where it's like--"
01:58:16;01:58:19;"Let's say she actually did live in Manhattan."
01:58:19;01:58:23;"Her boyfriend, he's out in Jersey, out on Long Island,"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"Westchester, whatever, and she's like,"
01:58:26;01:58:30;"""Oh, God, I hate going to Penn Station to take the train."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"It's so stressful."""
01:58:32;01:58:34;"He's like, ""Can your mom drive you?"""
01:58:34;01:58:35;"She's like, ""I'll ask."""
01:58:35;01:58:37;"Her mom's like, ""Of course I'm not driving you."
01:58:37;01:58:38;"Are you crazy?"""
01:58:38;01:58:42;"Then they would literally always sit around daydreaming,"
01:58:42;01:58:45;"""Oh, my God, one day I will get my driver's license,"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"jump in the car, drive out to the Burbs."
01:58:47;01:58:50;"We can hang in your family's big McMansion,"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"rate all that Costco [expletive],"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"eat all the Fritos in the garage."
