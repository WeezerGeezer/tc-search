00:00;00:03;"Hello, this is Rashida Jones."
00:03;00:12;"You're listening to Time Crisis, back again, today, with a Gen X edition of the Top 5."
00:12;00:16;"And Ask Me Anything with Jake."
00:16;00:19;"I think you'll enjoy it."
00:19;00:24;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:13;01:18;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up, fellas?"
01:18;01:23;"Well, this is old school. This is some 2020, 2021 stuff."
01:23;01:25;"Talking over FaceTime."
01:25;01:30;"Back on FaceTime. Had a little bit of laryngitis this week. Can you tell?"
01:31;01:32;"Honestly, no."
01:32;01:34;"Interesting."
01:34;01:36;"Did you get it on a Monday? Because I saw you Sunday."
01:36;01:41;"Literally, when I left the Richard Pictures show, my voice started disappearing on the ride home."
01:41;01:50;"And then I had two full days of... I must have had some kind of virus or something, but then manifested as laryngitis, which I haven't had in a long time."
01:50;01:57;"It wasn't that bad, but I always find it extra psychologically stressful because it just reminds me of losing my voice on tour."
01:57;01:59;"Yeah, can't even imagine."
02:00;02:07;"But yeah, it started coming back and still feel a little bit hoarse, so maybe I'll lay low a bit on this ep."
02:07;02:11;"See, I don't want to push it too far."
02:11;02:16;"I'll see if I can have the plane take off and then successfully land the plane."
02:16;02:22;"We got some great Jake AMA questions, which Seinfeld pulled from the internet."
02:22;02:24;"So I can always bail for that."
02:24;02:29;"And then Rashida says she's down to jump in for the top five."
02:29;02:30;"Oh, great."
02:30;02:32;"So I think we're good."
02:32;02:35;"You're not even going to listen. You're just going to bail."
02:35;02:39;"When Jake starts answering questions, you'll just go to the other room."
02:39;02:42;"I've heard enough of this blowhard."
02:42;02:49;"I'm going to go gargle with salt water."
02:49;02:51;"Hell yeah."
02:51;02:55;"OK, so wait, we got an email about a hundred gecks."
02:55;02:57;"Everybody's talking about a hundred gecks."
02:58;03:01;"There were a few hundred gecks tweets in the AMA."
03:01;03:03;"Oh, and plus an email."
03:03;03:05;"So we might as well lead with it."
03:05;03:07;"Hello TC family, this is a question for Jake."
03:07;03:13;"I've been listening to the new hundred gecks album, Ten Thousand Gecks, and realized that their music is very similar to Ween."
03:13;03:18;"Jake talks a lot about how much he loves Pure Guava, and the gecks are pretty similar to that album specifically, in my opinion."
03:18;03:21;"Would love to know if he's even heard of the gecks, and if so, what he thinks."
03:21;03:25;"Thanks, Anna, long time listener and attendee of the Webster Hall Show."
03:25;03:27;"Thanks for coming, Anna."
03:27;03:29;"Jake, are a hundred gecks on your radar?"
03:29;03:30;"Yes."
03:30;03:31;"OK."
03:31;03:35;"I've listened to the album one and a half times."
03:35;03:36;"Are you seeing the Ween connection?"
03:36;03:38;"Oh, for sure."
03:38;03:44;"I listened to it a few months ago, and it came out, and there was a lot of buzz around it for three days."
03:44;03:46;"Yeah."
03:46;03:54;"Checked it out while I was in the car, and then this afternoon I was going through some of the questions, and I remembered that email, so I threw it on again."
03:55;04:04;"Definitely see the Ween connection. Deliberately clumsy drum machines, and all over the place references."
04:04;04:15;"Deliberately bad music that will suddenly turn and become a little more poetic, or verging on beauty at times."
04:16;04:27;"I dig it. I mean, am I going to throw it on a lot? No, but yeah, there's some sort of pathos in the humor, and some goofy musical references, and I can see it."
04:27;04:29;"There you have it. Jake's take."
04:29;04:33;"Yeah. I'm a light endorsement."
04:33;04:41;"I haven't listened to the new album, but I've been working hard on the Vampire Weekend album, so I'm kind of in a zone."
04:42;04:52;"I've always liked them, and I remember I have Kevin, who Nick also knows, who's a very old friend of Ariel's."
04:52;05:09;"They kind of came up together in the Southern California ska scene, and as I was a big fan of ska in the '90s, sometimes the three of us talked ska, and Kevin would often
send us ska memes, things of that nature."
05:10;05:18;"And anybody who grew up in the '90s liking third wave ska, there's always been a lot of buzz about when is the fourth wave of ska going to happen."
05:18;05:23;"And for anybody, I assume, do I need to do a quick rundown of the waves of ska?"
05:23;05:26;"Please. Sure. Let's do it."
05:26;05:31;"Always happy to. I've been doing it for about 30 years now."
05:32;05:41;"The first wave of ska is 1960s Jamaica, a precursor to reggae, of course."
05:41;05:51;"And so you can picture the famous artists, the Scottilites, Desmond Decker, early Jamaican 1960s pop music."
05:51;05:53;"Early Bob."
05:53;05:59;"Yeah, even early Bob you could call ska. Probably the best known international song would be ""My Boy Lollipop."""
06:18;06:31;"The second wave would be the kind of English punky wave. The Specials, Madness, The Selector, the English beat, known as the beat in England, stuff like that."
06:31;06:35;"The Clash, you could say. They were doing some of that."
06:43;06:49;"And then third wave would be kind of 90s, maybe starting in the late 80s, but that wave of kind of punky ska."
06:49;06:56;"Maybe for a lot of listeners, the famous example would be the Mighty Mighty Bostones, because they broke open."
07:01;07:04;"Rancid, doing their thing."
07:05;07:14;"But that's for a lot of Americans, I think people picture when you hear the word ska, they immediately picture like a somewhat dorky version of punk from the 90s."
07:14;07:22;"Like a kind of, you know, a dorky punk band with a horn section. But there's still a lot of great stuff in that era. It's unfairly maligned."
07:22;07:28;"So anyway, those are the three waves of ska. We've all been waiting patiently for a fourth wave of ska."
07:29;07:36;"I tried to kick it off a little bit with Vampire Weekend, but never fully committed. I'll admit."
07:36;07:40;"What's the most ska song in the VW catalog?"
07:40;07:42;"Our most ska punk song is Holiday."
08:12;08:16;"There are ska moments. There's like an offbeat section of M79 on the first album."
08:16;08:23;"But on the second album, I felt like we'd made a big statement with our first album, and I felt like the second album, we need to go in some new directions."
08:23;08:33;"And I remember being like, there needs to be, you know, a ska song, you know, but it was only one song and it failed to kick off a wave or even feel part of a wave."
08:34;08:44;"I think people, I think the true believers have always known that there's a ska element. Even for, there's a, I think there's a cover, a ska cover or two of A Punk."
08:44;08:51;"I feel like every, every few months somebody sends that to me and you know, A Punk is not, doesn't have the skank."
09:19;09:23;"Anyway, there's been a lot of talk in the community about when will the fourth wave come?"
09:23;09:29;"It's a little bit like, you know, in certain Orthodox Jewish communities are talking about when will the Messiah come?"
09:29;09:35;"Because they do not accept Christ as the Messiah. They're still waiting for somebody else to come."
09:35;09:37;"So there's a lot of debate about it."
09:37;09:39;"It's a lot like that."
09:39;09:45;"In this case, Christ might be like hyper pop, where people start to be like, well, that is the fourth wave."
09:45;09:48;"You're waiting for the wrong thing. It already did come."
09:48;09:56;"So there's a lot of examples people give and there are bands, like there's a band called the Interrupters who I know are, they're touring all over the world."
09:56;10:08;"They're a ska band. But anyway, this guy, Kevin, through our text chain, he's kept me abreast of potential messianic developments in the ska world."
10:09;10:20;"I remember very vividly before 100 Gecs was becoming like a huge artist, he sent a song, I believe it was called Stupid Horse and said, check it out, fourth wave ska."
10:20;10:23;"And I remember, can we throw on Stupid Horse?"
10:23;10:26;"There's another ska song on the new album called I Got My Tooth Removed."
10:26;10:28;"Love it."
10:28;10:30;"Also Frog on the Floor."
10:38;10:41;"I remember hearing this and I did feel a little bit like the messiah had come."
10:45;10:47;"This is fourth wave ska."
11:14;11:20;"It also definitely has that weed vibe of like the weird pitched vocal with like the absolute chaotic guitar playing."
11:20;11:22;"Totally."
11:22;11:25;"Then it's good guitar playing and then it's back to chaos."
11:37;11:44;"This is like fourth wave ska, but it would be pretty sick if they had fully committed and every song sounded like this."
11:44;11:49;"That might actually spark a wave. Maybe that's the thing. Fourth wave ska is not a wave."
11:49;11:51;"People are dipping their toe in."
11:51;11:56;"Yeah, ska has been dispersed all over the place. There are traditionalist ska bands out there."
11:56;12:06;"It'll never die, but I don't think you're going to get a moment like the late 90s where you have these like big, big ska bands and giant package tours or whatever."
12:06;12:11;"But anyway, as soon as I heard that, I remember thinking this rules. This is very special."
12:11;12:22;"And I guess I kind of started focusing unfairly more just will this kick off the fourth wave of ska less than, you know, what kind of interesting thing will these artists
do?"
12:22;12:25;"But, you know, that was my unique way in."
12:25;12:30;"So, Nick, you just saw 100 Gecs in concert with your son. Is that right?"
12:31;12:41;"It is. It's his first. I tell you, it's Max's first non vampire show. Really? He'd been to like, you know, we saw him at the Richard Picture Show."
12:41;12:46;"Yes, yes, it's true. But we went to this the day before. It was a big weekend. It was a big weekend."
12:46;12:52;"We went from 100 Gecs to pretty much immediately to Richard Pictures. Big whiplash."
12:52;12:54;"Where was the show?"
12:54;12:56;"The show was at the Palladium."
12:57;13:05;"And it was I mean, it was great. I mean, we're big geck heads. Him and he went we went with a friend who is his age."
13:05;13:11;"So another 11 year old and their eight year old and her eight year old sister and everyone made their sort of homemade merch."
13:11;13:20;"And it was like he went into the pit. It was great. Wow. The audience was very is very interesting. They're really cool."
13:20;13:23;"They're also very well behaved. Like even the pit is like pretty well behaved."
13:24;13:27;"It's like sort of ska like a lot. There's a lot of ska dancing. What do you call it?"
13:27;13:34;"They're skanking. A lot of skanking. Yeah, I think that. But it was yeah, it was a it was a great show."
13:34;13:43;"Like a very tight hour. Short set. Yeah. I mean, their songs are short. I mean, the album is what 20 the new album is 27 minutes."
13:43;13:50;"Right. They probably played most of their two albums. Yeah. That's sick that they're that they're playing the Palladium."
13:51;13:56;"Sold out. Sold out show at the Palladium. Really crazy. Yeah. Rules. I really want to check out the second album."
13:56;14:05;"I also feel like, you know, I knew some people in like the New Jersey noise scene of the early 2000s."
14:05;14:10;"And that was always like I always found very fascinating, you know, and also sometimes like harsh."
14:10;14:20;"But going to like a basement show, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and seeing dudes who maybe would have been in like a punk band."
14:20;14:28;"Maybe have been in punk bands, but kind of like laying out their electronics and like making loops and putting their pedals together."
14:28;14:33;"Just like making crazy noise, just like sitting on the floor surrounded by wires in a basement."
14:33;14:40;"And even when that's harsh, it's still it's still is such like a cool, surreal vibe."
14:41;15:03;"Anyway, there's something about 20 years later, seeing 100 Gecs resonate so much with people and see like there is some something of the spirit of like late 90s, early
2000s noise shows, Internet culture, ska all coming together in a way that can speak to people of all ages."
15:04;15:15;"It was really it was so beautiful. And you're right. There's something about the Internet culture and that kids, I don't know where it didn't feel as I mean, I was
really, you know, like Jake, I was really into ween."
15:15;15:26;"But I do feel like there was something almost like you had to be like, not sophisticated about it, but sort of have some different kind of under like come at it from a place
that maybe other people didn't to get it."
15:26;15:30;"This feels like it's almost it's pop music or something."
15:31;15:42;"Ween dad, ween dad and the 100 Gecs son. They come together, they still can have some fun. Ween dad and his 100 Gecs."
15:42;15:47;"Yeah. And so you weren't worried about your 11 year old son entering the pit?"
15:48;16:01;"I went with him and he'd never been anything like it. But no, I think once you're in it, I was prepared to sort of like, you know, having gone to like, you know, like Fugazi
shows, like I was ready to sort of like maintain a space for him."
16:01;16:11;"Do you know what I mean? And like, I'm used to getting hit. And that was not like that. It was just sort of like there wasn't a lot of like slamming into each other and people
beating the out of each other."
16:11;16:16;"It was just more of like it was a heavy energy, but it was very like you said, they were skankin in the pit."
16:17;16:21;"Ween dad, 100 Gecs son together in the pit. Heavy but fun."
16:21;16:24;"Man, a Gecs ween tour would be sick."
16:24;16:42;"Yeah, maybe 100 Gecs opens, kids go nuts. Then they can go, there'll be an area where they can go play video games and eat pizza while the dad's kind of crowding with their
beers for the ween set."
16:43;16:49;"Love it. Can we get like a third generation in there? Like for the grandparents?"
16:49;16:56;"Wait, what would the grandpa like? 100 Gecs kid, ween parent, and the grandparent. Oh, Zappa."
16:56;17:00;"Zappa's dead. Is Beefheart still around or is he dead too?"
17:00;17:02;"I think he's dead."
17:02;17:04;"He's gotta be dead. I don't think."
17:04;17:09;"It could be like a dead and co-style Zappa, like reformed. You know what I mean?"
17:09;17:11;"Holographic Zappa."
17:12;17:13;"You'd be so anti too."
17:13;17:15;"Oh, of course."
17:15;17:24;"Hey Frank, we got an offer to do a triple headline tour with 100 Gecs and Ween. He'd find some reason to be pissed off about that."
17:24;17:26;"Why would I want to do that? It's pathetic."
17:26;17:31;"I want to be touring with the Prague Symphonic Orchestra. What is this s***?"
17:32;17:57;"I feel like one time we talked about there being kind of like a spectrum of kind of like fun. Maybe it's when we were talking about the Ween fish beef. We talked about
there's a spectrum that of kind of like fun loving music that maybe on one end is Ween and then on the other end is like Bare Naked Ladies. Fish is closer to Ween and there's
like they might be giants. It's kind of like closer to Bare Naked Ladies."
17:57;17:59;"Jesus."
18:00;18:03;"100 Gecs would be all the way on like the coolest end of the spectrum."
18:03;18:12;"Yeah, they'd be to the left of Ween. If Bare Naked Ladies is all the way to the right and Ween's all the way to the left, Gecs would be one slot left of Ween."
18:12;18:14;"Yeah."
18:14;18:15;"That's a funny continuum."
18:15;18:26;"I think because we were talking about this idea of like, you know, like the high school cafeteria that fish would be like the easygoing guys down to hang with anybody,
Ween a little more standoffish."
18:26;18:28;"For sure."
18:29;18:32;"And then you have like the musicians here and it's like, no, you still can't sit with us."
18:32;18:40;"I can even picture a Fish fan where you'd be like, do you like they might be giants or Bare Naked Ladies? They'd be like, are you kidding me? There's none of the
musicianship."
18:40;18:45;"It's like, oh, I just thought, you know, they're like maybe a similar sense of humor on certain songs on some songs. Get out of here, man."
18:45;18:47;"Those bands don't jam, dude."
18:47;18:53;"Yeah. And I get, well, yeah, Ween and Fish, they have their special place in the jam continuum."
18:53;18:55;"Yeah."
18:56;18:59;"Kiss your baby bye bye bye"
18:59;19:01;"If you're cute"
19:01;19:05;"The whole wide world will love with you"
19:05;19:07;"When we see"
19:07;19:11;"Nothing's wrong with you and me"
19:11;19:13;"Time will tell"
19:13;19:15;"It might even ring"
19:15;19:17;"A wedding bell"
19:17;19:19;"If you think"
19:19;19:22;"That I'm a loser"
19:24;19:25;"Well, you suck"
19:25;19:28;"Don't you know I ain't nothing"
19:28;19:30;"But a user"
19:30;19:32;"Of your love"
19:32;19:35;"I can't get enough"
19:35;19:38;"Girl, it's true"
19:38;19:41;"The whole wide world is smiling with you"
19:41;19:44;"Push the little daisies and make them come up"
19:54;19:56;"Well, there's some big news in soda."
19:56;19:59;"I guess you're about the new Pepsi logo?"
19:59;20:01;"Sort of."
20:01;20:03;"It was announced on March 28th."
20:03;20:08;"The goal of the new logo is to infuse great energy and confidence and boldness,"
20:08;20:13;"according to PepsiCo chief design officer Mauro Porcini."
20:13;20:15;"Porcini, maybe."
20:15;20:19;"He added, ""At PepsiCo, we design our brands to tell a compelling and holistic story."
20:20;20:24;"Pepsi is a shining example of a brand that has consistently reinvented itself over 125 years"
20:24;20:27;"to remain a part of pop culture and a part of people's lives."
20:27;20:32;"We design the new brand identity to connect future generations with our brand's heritage,"
20:32;20:38;"marrying distinction from our history with contemporary elements to signal our bold vision for what's to come."""
20:38;20:43;"Okay, so looking at the new logo, it's definitely a step up from the current one."
20:43;20:47;"The current Pepsi logo are these thin lowercase letters,"
20:48;20:50;"lacks confidence, very sad."
20:50;20:52;"The new one is a bit of a throwback."
20:52;20:56;"It's kind of like these funky, chunky letters."
20:56;20:59;"I don't know what it looks like. A little bit like 60s?"
20:59;21:01;"I would say it has more character."
21:01;21:05;"I would say that the current Pepsi logo, the one that's about to be replaced,"
21:05;21:07;"is maybe the weakest in history."
21:07;21:11;"Yeah, the can itself does not have that 60s throwback energy."
21:11;21:13;"It's just sort of..."
21:13;21:15;"No, just the typeface."
21:15;21:17;"Yeah, I could care less about this."
21:18;21:19;"[Laughter]"
21:19;21:21;"Should we just leave it there?"
21:21;21:24;"I mean, what do you got for me?"
21:24;21:28;"When you go back to the 19th century, the start,"
21:28;21:36;"it has this crazy calligraphy-looking logo with big circles and whatever."
21:36;21:39;"And then you get into the classic era."
21:39;21:45;"And then almost from 1965 through 2006, you just get these big, confident letters."
21:46;21:49;"Then we kind of drop down into this weird... I don't know."
21:49;21:51;"Whoa, you there? Uh-oh."
21:51;21:53;"[Bleep]"
22:05;22:07;"We're back."
22:07;22:09;"Pepsi's a mess. They're trying to reclaim something."
22:09;22:11;"It looks like they're getting back to some early 60s energy."
22:12;22:16;"Seinfeld, you told us a little bit about the history of the Pepsi logo."
22:16;22:20;"You told us there's a famous deck, a pitch."
22:20;22:25;"A famous 28-page Pepsi deck."
22:25;22:29;"Yeah, I mean, basically, it's this publicly available..."
22:29;22:34;"This is when Pepsi was rebranding to, I think, the previous logo."
22:34;22:40;"There was a design strategy deck provided by an agency called Arnell Group."
22:41;22:46;"The second page of it says, ""Breaking the code for innovation from convention to innovation."""
22:46;22:53;"And then what follows is 26 pages of marketing gobbledygook"
22:53;22:59;"with all sorts of geometric designs, references, Venn diagrams,"
22:59;23:06;"a trajectory of the history of the logos and how they've triangulated it into this new logo."
23:07;23:12;"It's a real, what's the word, artifact, I would say, of corporate design excess."
23:12;23:18;"And it's been talked about, I think it's from 2000... I want to say 2007."
23:18;23:20;"Can you read us some of the crazy parts?"
23:20;23:25;"I feel like they're talking about philosophy and phenomenology and stuff."
23:25;23:28;"Yeah, I'm scrolling through it right now."
23:28;23:35;"I mean, slide 26, the header is ""Breathtaking."" Subheader."
23:36;23:39;"""Creation of identity gravitational pull."""
23:39;23:42;"""Attraction theory."" ""The Pepsi proposition."""
23:42;23:49;"""Establishment of gravitational pull to shift from a transactional experience to an invitational expression."""
23:49;23:56;"And then what you have is a lot of diagrams of effectively how the placement of the product"
23:56;24:01;"with the logo from a certain perspective in the shopping aisle of the grocery store"
24:02;24:08;"is somehow intended to create some sort of consumer magnetic pull."
24:08;24:10;"It's real..."
24:10;24:12;"This is like some Dan Brown."
24:12;24:18;"They actually have diagrams in the pitch that are kind of like equating it with the gravitational pull of a planet?"
24:18;24:26;"Correct, yes. The slide 21, ""Dynamic forces,"" takes a cross-section of the planet Earth"
24:26;24:30;"and it goes down into the mantle, the inner core."
24:31;24:37;"Somehow they've extrapolated the shape of the Pepsi logo out of the cross-section of the planet"
24:37;24:45;"and then they've overlapped it with this weird geothermal magnetic field diagram."
24:45;24:47;"I love this."
24:47;24:49;"It's a trip, yeah."
24:49;24:52;"So I guess we don't know if this was a successful pitch or not?"
24:53;25:04;"Ultimately, I think it did result in the sort of wavy new Pepsi logo with the weird sort of warped white center thing"
25:04;25:12;"that's going on in the previous logo that they've since abandoned for this new retro-futuristic look."
25:12;25:16;"The Arnell Group is a real advertising agency."
25:16;25:22;"From what I can find, the founder, Peter Arnell, was known to be an idiosyncratic guy."
25:22;25:23;"So maybe it is real."
25:23;25:28;"I mean, you know, I think we were talking about this on the thread when this new logo came up"
25:28;25:35;"and we were sort of talking about the idea of the pitch as this kind of mesmerizing thing"
25:35;25:40;"where people come into a corporate boardroom and present all these diagrams"
25:40;25:45;"and there's so much thought that's been put into it that it sort of becomes a little bit hypnotic"
25:45;25:51;"and I go, ""Oh, my goodness, well, you've really considered this from every angle, even if it's not rooted in anything."""
25:51;25:52;"Real."
25:52;25:54;"So, yeah, it's interesting."
25:54;25:57;"I'm finding in CBSNews.com a reference to this being real."
25:57;26:03;"February 2009, Arnell sold Pepsi a pretentious, mostly made-up brand ideology document"
26:03;26:10;"linking Pepsi to the Mona Lisa, Descartes, and Hinduism as part of a successful logo redesign."
26:10;26:12;"Price? $1 million, reportedly."
26:12;26:17;"Maybe the Pepsi executives were kind of like, ""Redesign the logo."""
26:18;26:23;"They liked the design and then he also kind of threw all this stuff together and they're like, ""Okay, okay. All good."""
26:23;26:27;"You know, what you're paying for is the audacity."
26:27;26:34;"I think above anything else, you're going, ""Wow, this is an audacious, innovative, imaginative pitch"
26:34;26:36;"and I like these guys' moxie."""
26:36;26:39;"And then Arnell's like, ""No, this is a sacred text."""
26:39;26:41;"Yep."
26:41;26:44;"I'm dead serious about this."
26:45;26:49;"So, I don't know. It doesn't seem like there was a similar deck for the new rebrand."
26:49;26:51;"At least one that's been publicly surfaced."
26:51;26:55;"It definitely raises some interesting questions because, you know, famously,"
26:55;27:01;"advertising agencies started linking up with psychologists from the '40s onwards."
27:01;27:06;"Anybody who's an Adam Curtis fan has probably seen Century of the Self."
27:06;27:14;"Even in Mad Men, I think there's episodes and arcs that involve them talking to psychologists."
27:14;27:21;"And I guess when you picture kind of like a mid-century advertising agency talking to a psychologist,"
27:21;27:29;"you picture something kind of Freudian talking about the desires of men and women"
27:29;27:34;"and, you know, how their upbringing probably affected their development"
27:34;27:38;"and, you know, how they want to be perceived as mothers and fathers and men and women."
27:39;27:48;"But this raises the idea of, you know, was anybody linking up with like weirder, hardcore, you know, Jungian psychologists"
27:48;27:56;"who were almost just like talking about, you know, deep symbols and archetypes almost in a more mystical way."
27:56;28:02;"And I wonder how much like the kind of like straight-laced Madison Ave executives ever like bought it."
28:02;28:06;"Like, you know, for instance, people always, I'm sure you guys have seen over the years,"
28:07;28:14;"Illuminati conspiracy theorists talking about, you know, various Masonic or Illuminati symbolism"
28:14;28:18;"that you find a lot of corporate logos. Like CBS, for instance, it's just a big eye."
28:18;28:24;"You see eyes a lot. The eye is a classic symbol you see in different logos and stuff."
28:24;28:32;"And I wonder if there ever was a time where part of the reason, if it's not just a, you know, a Masonic ritual,"
28:33;28:38;"but part of the reasons is because there was some kind of like mystical Jungian psychologist who was like talking about"
28:38;28:44;"your brand should be part of ancient symbolic tradition of the watcher."
28:44;28:48;"You know, I wonder if there's anybody who ever like really kind of was like,"
28:48;28:51;"you know what makes CBS different from NBC?"
28:51;28:55;"They're a stupid peacock. They're just like a silly animal."
28:55;28:59;"What we see you as being the all-seeing eye of God."
29:00;29:05;"We don't literally mean that you're God, but we feel that what you bring to the table"
29:05;29:10;"is similar to what primitive man saw when he looked up at the sky"
29:10;29:13;"and felt the watchers looking down on him."
29:13;29:19;"You know, I wonder if there is that level of kind of mysticism at times in any of this."
29:19;29:23;"You know, and some of your programming, like the wheel of fortune,"
29:23;29:27;"is coherent with this vision of your company."
29:28;29:31;"The wheel."
29:31;29:37;"The circle is the most fundamental shape and the wheel is, you know, mankind's first invention,"
29:37;29:42;"which enabled them to begin civilization."
29:42;29:46;"And of course it's the wheel, the wheels turning. Can't slow down."
30:49;30:53;"Didn't they used to execute, like people, early wheel of fortune"
30:53;30:57;"weren't the people who didn't win, they were executed. Is that true?"
30:57;30:59;"You mean before it was a TV show?"
30:59;31:01;"No, like the first couple seasons."
31:02;31:03;"Oh."
31:03;31:06;"Like in the, when did it start? In the seventies?"
31:06;31:08;"Yeah, I just feel like there was this primitive."
31:08;31:11;"Yeah, I think you can kill people on live TV in the seventies."
31:11;31:14;"I'm not sure, again, my."
31:14;31:16;"Urban legend."
31:16;31:18;"I got to check it. Yeah."
31:18;31:22;"That would be impossible to believe, but I could almost picture a version where somebody would actually say like,"
31:22;31:27;"the wheel of fortune is rooted in a medieval torture game."
31:28;31:34;"That, you know, the mad King Henry the eighth used to play."
31:34;31:36;"He was obsessed with word games."
31:36;31:41;"Yeah. It's kind of like, you know, everybody, like a lot of people know the band Iron Maiden."
31:41;31:43;"That's, that's named after medieval torture device."
31:43;31:46;"But you know, it's weird. A lot of people know that, but you know, it's weirder."
31:46;31:49;"So is wheel of fortune, the TV show."
31:49;31:54;"It was a really twisted game that a sadistic King used to play."
31:55;31:58;"And it's like, oh, what was it like? Well, it was essentially, it was the same."
31:58;32:03;"He had to guess letters of popular phrases, except they would tie you to the wheel."
32:03;32:06;"There was a game in ancient Rome called the prices, right?"
32:06;32:14;"Which, you know, was done at the Colosseum and frequently ended up with people being beheaded."
32:14;32:21;"If you guessed, you know, just a dollar over, just a, just one Roman, one Roman nickel over, you were beheaded."
32:22;32:27;"A lot of people don't think it's fair that just because you guess over, but you're closer to the number than, than the lower guess."
32:27;32:28;"Right."
32:28;32:30;"That you don't win. But actually there's a reason for it."
32:30;32:36;"The sadistic Emperor Caligula, he was, anyway."
32:36;32:38;"He was very frugal."
32:38;32:41;"Do you know the iconic, the wheel of fortune theme song?"
32:41;32:45;"Are you familiar with it? With the saxophone melody?"
32:45;32:50;"Oh boy. I know I'll know it if you play it. Can we throw it on?"
33:02;33:05;"You might have realized the wheel of fortune theme is city pop."
33:05;33:08;"It is, it does have a city pop vibe."
33:08;33:11;"This record cost $2,000 on Discogs."
33:11;33:14;"[Laughter]"
33:14;33:16;"Never released outside Japan."
33:16;33:18;"Test pressing."
33:19;33:26;"I just feel like if you, like a slowed down version of that would be very ominous. Like, like a Gregorian chant version."
33:26;33:31;"That's like the last ditch bottom of the barrel in the content wars."
33:31;33:41;"Maybe this, they could do this during the writer's strike, but everybody tried to shake any kind of, squeeze any kind of 20th century content into a universe."
33:41;33:47;"Of course, there's the very successful Marvel cinematic universe and the Star Wars universe is going on and on."
33:48;33:53;"Universal tried to create a horror universe based on their classic horror movies."
33:53;33:56;"They made the mummy and the invisible man and..."
33:56;33:58;"Oh, the dark universe."
33:58;34:02;"They were trying to create the dark universe. Didn't quite work out."
34:02;34:09;"But maybe one of these giant media companies will try to do a kind of like gritty game show reboot."
34:09;34:13;"The wheel of fortune one, I could almost see."
34:14;34:22;"This one's not that hard to picture is just like sitting down with a writer and be like, we want to make a kind of prestige TV show or a film."
34:22;34:28;"That's kind of like the medieval horror, dark gritty origins of wheel of fortune."
34:28;34:34;"It's like a little bit of brave heart, a little bit of like that show Penny Dreadful."
34:34;34:37;"That was kind of like, or like Victorian horror."
34:37;34:40;"They can totally do that. And then like the price is right."
34:41;34:50;"It's all kind of like genre stuff. Maybe the price is right takes place in kind of like turn of the century New York, like Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano."
34:50;34:57;"Like a little bit of that on that same street in little Italy, like every movie always takes place on, you know, going back forever."
34:57;35:05;"Like a horse and carts and like a bunch of oranges fall and a little kid in like a newsy cap running out."
35:06;35:10;"Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. And then there's so many."
35:10;35:14;"There's a variety of games."
35:14;35:16;"The price is right."
35:16;35:21;"There was such a variety of games that you could really imagine the sort of gauntlet feel of it."
35:21;35:24;"You know, like the what's the price is wrong."
35:24;35:28;"Pop, I'm telling you in America, the price is right."
35:28;35:30;"And I'm going to take this whole country."
35:30;35:33;"You just watch pop. We ain't in Italy no more."
35:34;35:43;"It sort of could be this casino element, you know, because once it gets to Burbank, California, you know, I think like the gritty New York and their sort of second act
turn."
35:43;35:48;"They move to Burbank and you think everything's great. But obviously it's, you know, it's seedy."
35:48;35:51;"It's a menacing sunlight."
35:51;35:53;"That's when it gets real dark."
35:53;35:57;"That one kind of makes sense because I'm sure there were probably were dudes."
35:58;36:02;"In the history of Hollywood who are like producers on one of the prices, right?"
36:02;36:04;"Start 70s."
36:04;36:07;"I'm going to guess earlier on that 60s 60s."
36:07;36:09;"That's my guess."
36:09;36:12;"You did like did Bob Barker fight in World War Two?"
36:12;36:14;"Nineteen seventy two was the first."
36:14;36:18;"OK, let me get a number of questions that did Bob Barker fight in World War Two."
36:18;36:20;"I'm going to guess."
36:20;36:22;"Yes. Oh my God."
36:22;36:25;"You know, autocomplete filled out the rest of the question."
36:25;36:27;"It was immediate."
36:27;36:31;"I typed it did Bob Barker F and it went fight in World War Two."
36:31;36:34;"Oh, Bob Barker."
36:34;36:41;"He was in the United States Navy Reserve in 1943 during World War Two to train as a fighter pilot, but did not serve in active duty."
36:41;36:43;"Does that count?"
36:43;36:45;"Yeah, he was in the arm. He was in the military."
36:45;36:47;"He was involved."
36:47;36:49;"All right. I didn't see any action, but."
36:49;36:51;"Sound disappointed."
36:52;37:02;"OK, if it started in 1972, theoretically, there could have been an older Hollywood producer who was born in like turn of the century Brooklyn."
37:02;37:03;"Yeah."
37:03;37:07;"And literally watched the rise of Lucky Luciano."
37:07;37:09;"No, this is like Mad Men."
37:09;37:12;"The real Bob Barker died in World War Two."
37:12;37:20;"And then, you know, and then he came, took Bob Barker's identity and now has made The Price is Right."
37:21;37:29;"He took his, maybe he found a he found a journal in his, you know, in his bunker of his, you know, you know, comrade who was shot down."
37:29;37:36;"And it was like the rules and the gameplay for The Price is Right that he had sort of been sort of tooling around."
37:36;37:41;"Oh, when I get back, when I get back from this war, I'm going to create one of the first TV game shows."
37:41;37:45;"But I think in this one also, Bob Barker needs to have killed him."
37:45;37:47;"Oh, yes, yes. Really?"
37:47;37:49;"Let's make it more ambiguous."
37:50;37:52;"He wasn't he because he found the journal."
37:52;37:55;"He was like, oh, this is my opportunity."
37:55;37:57;"I think there's a bit of a Ray Kroc."
37:57;38:00;"There's a bit of a Ray Kroc element, like the Bob Barker name."
38:00;38:03;"You know, that's part of that's the key to the whole thing, too."
38:03;38:07;"Like the name is just so essential to the whole."
38:07;38:11;"Oh, and you guys remember how Bob Barker was always, you know, he's a huge animal rights guy."
38:11;38:14;"Get your cat spayed and dog spayed and neutered."
38:14;38:18;"Is it the Bob Barker who killed his partner hates animals."
38:19;38:23;"And when he came back and he sort of took his identity, everyone's like, oh, he was this huge animal lover."
38:23;38:30;"So sort of this other thing is like, you know, that it's sort of like that's his own sort of albatrosses that he hates animals."
38:30;38:33;"Yet he's like in taking over his good."
38:33;38:38;"Yeah, I think this game when the writer strikes over, we're going to really hit the ground running."
38:38;38:45;"And one more, obviously, supermarket sweep is kind of like Hunger Games."
38:46;38:49;"Hunger Games meets Running Man. It's a dystopian future."
38:49;38:51;"Not a lot of food to go around."
38:51;38:58;"Maybe it's like Squid Games, actually, because wasn't there some talk about there being them making an American squid game?"
38:58;39:02;"Like, hey, guys, the game show, they're making a game show, Squid Games, right?"
39:02;39:05;"The real life Squid Games. That's what Supermarket Sweep already was."
39:05;39:08;"What I love about this, too, is like the Wheel of Fortune."
39:08;39:14;"It speaks to the elemental, the primitive nature of the wheel being the proto game show."
39:15;39:18;"You've taken it post apocalyptic with the supermarket sweep."
39:18;39:22;"You've taken it all like all the way to the end of civilization."
39:22;39:30;"We've just we're scrapping over cans of beans and an old bag of rice in the ruins of civilization."
39:30;39:34;"Oh, yeah, totally. It's like bombed out futuristic Mad Max world."
39:34;39:37;"And there's this like one heavily guarded supermarket."
39:37;39:44;"Right. And if you're lucky enough to eat, it is only under these sort of circumstances where it's like it's like all or nothing."
39:44;39:51;"Like how much can you get people sort of outside, you know, outside the supermarket, outside the city walls?"
39:51;39:55;"You know, they're yeah, they're suffering and there's a decadent warlord."
39:55;40:05;"And every once in a while he sends his troops into the hinterlands to drag a good looking guy who just wants to take care of his sister with one leg."
40:05;40:09;"And he grabs him and says, time for the sweep."
40:10;40:15;"And he brings them in. And if this guy doesn't win supermarket sweep, I mean, it's the purge."
40:15;40:18;"Yeah, it's like the purge. Nobody's going to take care of that."
40:18;40:21;"But one day a year you get to supermarket sweep. Yeah."
40:50;41:09;"Ain't singing for Miller. Don't sing for Bud. I won't sing for politicians. Ain't singing for spuds. This note's for you."
41:09;41:14;"All right. I think I should lay off these pipes. Let's get in some of these Jake questions."
41:15;41:25;"But the last thing I want to say before I go silent is, was there any reaction to Jake's publicly proclaiming he's decidedly not a Prince fan?"
41:25;41:34;"The number of playlists that were sent our way via Twitter and email. Jake, I think I sent you all of them. It was like six or seven different playlists."
41:34;41:39;"Oh, I only got a few. I was going to say I could count on one hand the number of playlists we got."
41:39;41:41;"Well, that's not far from it."
41:41;41:43;"No, no, I know. Yeah, we got a few."
41:44;41:48;"Like more than independently people took it upon themselves."
41:48;41:53;"People weren't seeing each other doing this. People just all thought."
41:53;41:59;"Yep. Did you listen? I got to deal with this. No. Come on, man. No, that's not true."
41:59;42:10;"I did start one from a guy named Tyler who I think I'm friends with on Twitter. And I started it. Yeah. You know, I didn't know he wrote Manic Monday."
42:11;42:14;"But we don't need to rehash the Prince stuff, you know."
42:14;42:18;"All right. We'll save that for another day. Yeah. You listen to all six to seven playlists."
42:18;42:20;"Exactly. I need to really do my homework."
42:20;42:25;"All right. Well, here let's get in. This is a segment called Jake's AMA."
42:25;42:32;"All right. Jake, what's your take on the experience of being a fine artist in the gallery system?"
42:33;42:46;"That's a serious question. Well, it takes a while to find your way, or at least it did for me. I've worked with four dealers in a serious way. And fourth time's a charm in my
case."
42:46;42:49;"I wish he had written more specific questions than that."
42:49;42:52;"You could go rapid fire. You don't have to."
42:52;42:56;"Yeah, let's keep it moving. I mean, I would just say, yeah, it's a tough nut to crack."
42:56;43:01;"When you're a young artist, it's hard to figure out where you fit in or if you fit in."
43:02;43:06;"I'm interested in it, Jake, because a lot of people maybe don't know. What is the first step?"
43:06;43:13;"Yeah, the way I did it was when I was living in Oregon, I did tons of shows at coffee shops and stuff."
43:13;43:18;"You know when you go to a coffee shop and there's art on the wall and they rotate it every few months?"
43:18;43:27;"So I did a lot of coffee shop shows, bookstore shows, restaurant shows in Oregon. I was doing a couple a year."
43:28;43:37;"And then you just meet people that way and then you eventually show in a smaller gallery that sees your work somehow."
43:37;43:47;"Imagine being the lucky son of a b*tch that bought a long strap at a f*cking Java house. Mortgage paid."
43:47;43:54;"No. I don't think that stuff's really worth anything because it's not really indicative of the work I do now."
43:55;44:04;"I did a show at a Borders bookstore in Portland, Oregon. It was all Cubist toilets. They were joke paintings."
44:04;44:14;"And I did all these fake Cubist paintings, but it was all like, instead of bowls of fruit and Greek busts, it was all toilets."
44:14;44:20;"I just was doing shows like that. I did a lot of early Taco Bell paintings and other shows."
44:21;44:28;"I did a show of this guy Stan McMahon, who was the singer in Giant Bug Village, the world's first gutted by voices cover band."
44:28;44:33;"I did a series of paintings of him eating pizza. Really just grotesque paintings."
44:33;44:39;"And then you just start working with a small gallery and then things kind of like anything."
44:39;44:47;"It's like being in a band. You play shows with your friends. Maybe someone takes interest. You kind of slowly grow it over time."
44:48;44:52;"And as was the case, it quickly snowballs. I mean, really, everyone has a different path."
44:52;45:00;"Do you ever hear from those early buyers who are like, ""Hey, Jake, I got the Cubist toilet!"""
45:00;45:05;"No one that I don't know. No one truly out of the blue."
45:05;45:15;"All right. What's Jake's go-to order at Wendy's? Has he tried/have thoughts about the strawberry frosty? Jake, do you have a Wendy's go-to order?"
45:16;45:20;"I don't. I will never try strawberry frosty. It sounds disgusting."
45:20;45:24;"When was the last time you ate at Wendy's? 2014."
45:24;45:28;"What sounds disgusting about it? Just like a strawberry milkshake sounds disgusting?"
45:28;45:30;"Yeah, I don't like strawberry ice cream."
45:30;45:34;"Wait, is a frosty a milkshake? Isn't it like it's a carbonated?"
45:34;45:37;"No, it's a milkshake. It is a milkshake?"
45:37;45:39;"Straight up milkshake. Really?"
45:39;45:44;"Yeah. I think a frosty was like more of like a slushy with like a milky..."
45:45;45:48;"Do you have a go-to order at any fast food place? Like a Taco Bell?"
45:48;45:59;"Um, no. I mean, in LA, I would go to Del Taco. I'd probably get like shrimp tacos or something. Wouldn't hit a T-Bell."
45:59;46:01;"All right."
46:01;46:10;"Jake, @hilltopper39 wants to know, ""Where does Leonard Skinner fall on the list of best American rock bands?"
46:11;46:20;"I know they're not number one, but I don't think they're outside the top 10. Maybe even the five dots, like a five dot ellipsis. Top five?"
46:20;46:26;"I agree to disagree, @hilltopper39. I don't know if they'd make my top 50."
46:26;46:28;"Oh, you're not a fan of that?"
46:28;46:35;"I like Tuesday's Gone. I like Simple Man. That's about it. Not a Skinnered guy."
46:35;46:40;"The number of Skinnered playlists you're about to get hit with."
46:40;46:45;"Brace yourself for a Skinnered onslaught."
46:45;47:00;"@Skags_Jackson asks, ""What's Jake's take on the food replacement startup Soylent, taking its name Soylent after the 1973 dystopian film Soylent Green?"""
47:00;47:06;"You know, it's funny. I dig it. I feel like that was like a big thing like eight years ago."
47:07;47:12;"I remember that there was a whole like, ""Ooh, Soylent's going to replace lunch."" There was a big New Yorker article."
47:12;47:18;"I remember being on a camping trip with some friends of mine in 2013, 2014."
47:18;47:25;"I was like, ""Yeah, it's cool. If you're a 22-year-old tech bro that's just grinding, working 18 hours a day and you don't have time to deal with..."""
47:25;47:33;"This is before the rise of Postmates and those kind of food delivery apps."
47:34;47:38;"I was like, ""Yeah, if you're just on your grind, do it."" I remember my friend was just like so disgusted."
47:38;47:43;"She was just like, ""What are you talking about? Food should be savored. It's an important part of life."
47:43;47:49;"Just to have these guys eating this mush, this slurry is subhuman."""
47:49;47:52;"Are you an eat to live or live to eat guy?"
47:52;47:55;"More often than not, I'm an eat to live."
47:55;47:58;"I mean, who doesn't like a live to eat experience?"
47:58;48:03;"Who has the time or the money or whatever to..."
48:04;48:08;"It's lunch on a Tuesday. I can't take two hours."
48:08;48:10;"You're the demo."
48:10;48:12;"I'm not going to drop 80 bucks on lunch."
48:12;48:15;"Guys, you know what I think about kind of often?"
48:15;48:22;"I remember on the show when Jake said that he sometimes would eat a Snickers as a meal supplement."
48:22;48:25;"I've done it."
48:25;48:29;"I think about it all the time because it never occurred to me because it works."
48:29;48:32;"We might have talked about them, but the Snickers satisfies."
48:32;48:33;"I was like..."
48:33;48:37;"It just never would have occurred to me to do that."
48:37;48:39;"I think about that all the time."
48:39;48:41;"I do that like eight or nine times a year."
48:41;48:43;"Snickers for lunch, dude."
48:43;48:45;"I had a big breakfast."
48:45;48:48;"Snickers for lunch, it satisfies."
48:48;48:54;"And then that's why advertising really did work because then I just picture the early 1990s ad."
48:54;49:01;"And it's just the construction, the burly construction guy in the I-beam just like biting into a Snickers."
49:02;49:03;"You doing a king size?"
49:03;49:05;"You doing king size or just the king size?"
49:05;49:08;"If I'm doing one of my rare Snickers for lunch."
49:08;49:13;"If it's a meal supplement, if it's a full meal supplement, he needs the calories."
49:13;49:15;"Yeah, you got to go king size."
49:15;49:19;"King size, that's 440 calories in one bar, 47 grams."
49:19;49:21;"That's a total meal."
49:21;49:23;"So what is it? You're supposed to get 2,000 a day?"
49:23;49:25;"Or that's the average?"
49:25;49:27;"Yeah, that's like the recommended, I think."
49:27;49:30;"Okay, so you're getting like what? You're getting a quarter?"
49:30;49:31;"It's a light lunch."
49:31;49:33;"It's a light lunch."
49:33;49:35;"Got some peanuts in there. Yeah, not bad."
49:35;49:43;"I'm realizing why the Wendy's Frosty was a little bit bumping for me because it's a cross between a milkshake and soft serve ice cream."
49:43;49:46;"So it's not a straight up milkshake."
49:46;49:49;"There's something else in there."
49:49;49:55;"We got @cantaloupemelon asking, I like this one."
49:56;50:02;"What famous Gen Z person would Jake crack a mountain brew with and what's his take on the generation as a whole?"
50:02;50:04;"I have a pitch."
50:04;50:09;"Okay, well, I was going to ask what year does Gen Z start?"
50:09;50:12;"Like what age is like the oldest Gen Z right now?"
50:12;50:18;"Yeah, Gen Z, people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s."
50:19;50:28;"Wait, wait, mid 1990s to mid 2010s who are seen as confident users of new technology, according to the Collins Dictionary."
50:28;50:33;"So that puts you basically like late 20s."
50:33;50:35;"Oh, yeah."
50:35;50:37;"Or early to mid 20s."
50:37;50:41;"Your 20s basically. What's your pitch, Seinfeld?"
50:41;50:44;"One person immediately came to mind, Timothee Chalamet."
50:44;50:46;"Yeah, I can dig that. Is he in his 20s?"
50:46;50:48;"He's 27."
50:48;50:51;"He was born in '96 or whatever."
50:51;50:53;"Yeah, I mean, embarrassingly."
50:53;50:55;"Silverback Gen Z."
50:55;51:01;"Embarrassingly, I don't know that many famous people in their 20s."
51:01;51:03;"Do you know what I mean?"
51:03;51:05;"Casta Euphoria?"
51:05;51:11;"Yep. I'd crack a mountain brew with Sydney Schrader. Is that her name? Sydney Schrader? Is that her name?"
51:11;51:14;"Close enough."
51:15;51:18;"She was on the White Lotus."
51:18;51:21;"You'd crack a brew with Sydney Sweeney."
51:21;51:24;"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sydney Sweeney, not Schrader."
51:24;51:29;"I'd crack a mountain brew with Sydney Sweeney."
51:29;51:31;"I'd pay to watch that."
51:31;51:33;"Oh, yo."
51:33;51:35;"I got a pitch for you."
51:35;51:42;"Okay. And again, this is a half-baked idea, but Sydney Sweeney, famously, she's into automobile repair."
51:42;51:44;"I don't know if you know about that."
51:44;51:45;"I didn't know that."
51:45;51:51;"I think there was some press around how she has an old Ford Bronco or some sort of old car that she likes to fix up."
51:51;51:54;"I'm going back to the Snickers thing."
51:54;51:56;"Okay."
51:56;52:01;"Do you remember those Snickers ads where it's like, you're not you when you're hungry?"
52:01;52:07;"I think there's something with like, Jake, Sydney Sweeney, Jake is hangry, he eats his Snickers."
52:07;52:13;"Again, I don't have all the pieces put together yet, but I do feel like there's some sort of advertising moment there."
52:13;52:16;"Oh, the two of us in an ad."
52:16;52:20;"Instead of drinking a beer, eating Snickers together."
52:20;52:24;"Cranking on the 1989 Ford Bronco."
52:24;52:28;"I'd like to be at that Wiedemann Kennedy pitch."
52:28;52:31;"Well, there's an American painter."
52:31;52:33;"So what's the pitch?"
52:33;52:34;"There's an American painter."
52:34;52:37;"Internet radio show host, his name's Jake Longstreth."
52:38;52:44;"I have this idea that I was listening to the show and he did say he actually eats Snickers sometimes for lunch."
52:44;52:47;"And then we get Sydney Sweeney from Euphoria."
52:47;52:51;"She likes cars, but I could see her sitting down with him."
52:51;52:57;"And it sort of brings sort of an older Gen X, Gen Z together."
52:57;52:59;"Right?"
53:00;53:09;"Over their shared sort of ""eat to live"" kind of mentality."
53:09;53:14;"That should be the new Snickers slogan, ""eat to live."""
53:14;53:16;"Oh, I love that."
53:16;53:20;"I think that's Super Bowl gold right there. I think it writes itself."
53:20;53:25;"The king size, aren't there two bars? Or is it a single large bar?"
53:25;53:26;"It's a single large bar."
53:26;53:28;"And Jake?"
53:29;53:30;"Yeah, right? It's not two bars."
53:30;53:32;"No, sometimes it is."
53:32;53:34;"Sometimes it is?"
53:34;53:36;"Yeah, I've gotten that."
53:36;53:41;"Oh, like different parts by coastal? Is it like in New York it's two?"
53:41;53:46;"I don't know. I definitely have experienced both."
53:46;53:50;"Two mid-sized bars or the one king size."
53:50;53:54;"I think we've beat this one into the ground."
53:54;53:56;"Let's move on."
53:56;53:58;"I feel like it's got more miles."
53:58;53:59;"I think it's got more miles."
53:59;54:01;"I'm hearing Sydney Sweeney, I'm hearing you go,"
54:01;54:05;"""Normally I would absolutely give this to you, but I just didn't have time for lunch."""
54:05;54:07;"And she's like, ""Totally."""
54:07;54:11;"Wait a second. Wait a second. Okay, okay, okay."
54:11;54:15;"Snickers is reintroducing the two bar king size. Okay?"
54:15;54:17;"Okay."
54:17;54:21;"It's one bar. You two are both so hangry. You're fighting over it."
54:21;54:23;"You snap your..."
54:23;54:26;"You rip it apart."
54:27;54:29;"You know what? I gotta stop."
54:29;54:31;"I'm losing control."
54:31;54:35;"You see where I'm going with that, though."
54:35;54:36;"Yes."
54:37;54:40;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike"
54:40;54:46;"Meet at the trail headlight around a quarter to three"
54:46;54:51;"Me and Bobby stayed out late last night"
54:51;54:57;"Get on the trail, shake the cobwebs free"
54:57;55:02;"As we get to the top of the mountain, there's a view"
55:04;55:07;"Take a load off and crack a few mountain brews"
55:07;55:15;"Mountain brews"
55:15;55:19;"Sweet mountain brews"
55:19;55:26;"Mountain brews"
55:26;55:29;"Sweet as morning dew"
55:30;55:36;"@teacoccus I'd like to ask Jake as a painter, what inspires you to paint?"
55:36;55:39;"Music? Book? How do you decide what to paint?"
55:39;55:42;"What inspires me to... Well, yeah."
55:42;55:44;"Okay. If you... Painting is..."
55:44;55:49;"You're trying to distill your consciousness into a physical object, right?"
55:49;55:53;"So it's like, that's what you're trying to convey how you see the world."
55:53;55:55;"So it's not music or a book."
55:56;56:04;"It's something that I see in a fleeting moment, the light catching off the backside of a Taco Bell."
56:04;56:08;"And I just think that I'm moved by that for some mysterious reason."
56:08;56:12;"And try to articulate that in a picture form."
56:12;56:15;"So I think that's what inspires me."
56:15;56:17;"It's beautiful."
56:17;56:21;"Is that on your side of the motorcycle?"
56:21;56:24;"Different guy, but I think he's gone."

56:32;56:33;"No, no, no."
56:33;56:34;"Nick Weinfeld."
56:34;56:35;"No, no, it's not me."
56:35;56:37;"But I like that if I... I just had to goose the numbers."
56:37;56:39;"I didn't know if anyone was going to respond to that."
56:39;56:40;"Yeah, that's right."
56:40;56:46;"Nick Weinfeld of Finsta asks, best Eagles member solo albums?"
56:46;56:49;"Don Henley, The End of the Innocence."
56:49;56:53;"There's a pretty good Randy Meisner one, which I'm not remembering the name of."
56:54;56:56;"In which he does another version of Take It to the Limit."
56:56;57:00;"But it's pretty thin going with the Eagles solo albums."
57:00;57:05;"Is it the self-titled 1982 Randy Meisner?"
57:05;57:07;"Does it have Take It to the Limit on it?"
57:07;57:09;"Actually, no, it doesn't."
57:09;57:10;"Whatever."
57:10;57:11;"It doesn't look like it."
57:11;57:15;"Well, no, because for people at home who want to be like, yo, I'm going to check out that."
57:15;57:19;"Yeah, I feel like the one I have is like late 70s."
57:19;57:20;"Because he did leave the band."
57:20;57:22;"Oh."
57:22;57:24;"After Hotel California."
57:24;57:25;"Wait, hang on a second."
57:25;57:28;"Randy Meisner has two albums called Randy Meisner."
57:28;57:32;"And one came out in '78 and one came out in '82."
57:32;57:33;"Is that?"
57:33;57:34;"That's odd."
57:34;57:39;"And then the first one, '78, does have Take It to the Limit."
57:39;57:41;"Yeah, that's the one I have."
57:41;57:43;"Like dollar bin vinyl style."
57:43;57:45;"It's solid."

58:23;58:28;"Spent my life running around"
58:28;58:32;"And it's so hard to change"
58:32;58:37;"Can't see the sun now"
58:37;58:43;"But the dreams I've seen lately"
58:43;58:48;"Keep on turning out"
58:48;58:51;"And burning out"
58:51;58:57;"And turning out the same"
58:57;59:01;"So put me on the highway"
59:01;59:05;"Show me the sign"
59:06;59:10;"So take it to the limit"

59:21;59:23;"I like this one. I like this one."
59:23;59:29;"A lot. Although I feel like it's really the western United States that has the bulk of the national parks."
59:29;59:31;"I feel like the East Coast really gets hosed."
59:32;59:36;"Off the top of my head, I mean Arcadia and Maine, which I've never actually been to."
59:36;59:39;"And then there's the Everglades in Florida, which I have been to."
59:39;59:42;"But really it's all about the West Coast, right?"
59:42;59:52;"So I've done Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, Sequoias, Lassen, Redwoods."
59:52;59:55;"So California has like eight or seven or eight majors."
59:55;59:57;"I've done Crater Lake in Oregon."

01:00:44;01:00:46;"What's wet-on-wet painting?"
01:00:46;01:00:52;"It's oil paint because oil paint will stay wet on the surface for quite a while."
01:00:52;01:00:56;"Generally several hours or a day or so."
01:00:57;01:01:06;"So you have wet paint down and then you just go in and start working adjacent to or directly on top of the paint that's already down."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"So then the strokes start to blur together a little bit."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"And so Bob Ross will do that."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"He'll paint in a sky, right?"
01:01:13;01:01:20;"And then he'll do the happy pine trees or whatever with the fan brush directly over the wet sky."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"So all the edges have a softness to them."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Does that make sense?"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"Okay, I got it. Yeah, I got it."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I like wet-on-wet painting. It's very beautiful."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"It's very luscious and very beautiful."
01:01:31;01:01:35;"I remember I really loved the Bob Ross program when I was a kid."
01:01:35;01:01:39;"I mean, it's amazing to watch that stuff come."
01:01:39;01:01:45;"The way he has a color down and then you see the color he's mixing on the palette."
01:01:45;01:01:51;"It seems really weird and harsh and then he puts it on and it works."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"I remember being really captivated by that as a kid."
01:01:55;01:02:03;"And how quickly he was able to render a sense of space and light was really cool."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"So shout out to Bob."

01:03:11;01:03:14;"Dali, they're awesome to see in person."
01:03:14;01:03:20;"They're all surprisingly dense and surprising in person."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Warhol, what can you say?"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I mean, he started..."
01:03:24;01:03:29;"I think of him as the beginning of contemporary art, really, is Andy Warhol."
01:03:29;01:03:34;"One of the first postmodern contemporary artists."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"Chuck Close is..."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Yeah, it's amazing."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"The early stuff, absolutely..."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"I have no idea how he made those."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"And a lot of artists use assistants."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"I have an assistant, this guy Josh that works for me three days a week."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Shout out to Josh."
01:03:51;01:03:55;"He actually listens to Time Crisis, so he'll probably hear this at some point."
01:03:55;01:03:59;"But Josh is an immense help for me in the studio."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"Should we come on the show?"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Maybe. I can ask him."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"I think we got..."
01:04:05;01:04:08;"I mean, some of these questions, honestly, you've answered organically."
01:04:08;01:04:13;"Even before we started this, there's a question about Ska and 100 Gex."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"The letter spoke to it."
01:04:15;01:04:19;"And then there's a question about cubism, but I think you've already spoken to it a little bit."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"So the last one, I guess, is..."
01:04:21;01:04:25;"@Squirtle, do you use masking tape on your paintings?"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"How are the lines so clean?"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I do use masking tape."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"Not for everything, but certainly, yeah."
01:04:31;01:04:37;"If you want a clean roofline against the sky, yeah, you tape that off."
01:04:37;01:04:42;"Otherwise, I'll just use a paintbrush and a ruler."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"With oil paint, the key thing with not having it bleed is having the paint be the right viscosity."
01:04:47;01:04:52;"If it's too thinned out, it will bleed under the tape, which is a classic problem."
01:04:52;01:04:56;"So the paint needs to be pretty thick if you're going to use tape."
01:04:56;01:05:01;"Acrylic, you don't have that problem as much, because you can use a matte medium."
01:05:01;01:05:05;"But yeah, man, tape and rulers, for sure."
01:05:05;01:05:09;"I hope listeners of the show appreciate your transparency about your technique"
01:05:09;01:05:13;"and your willingness to let people in on how the sausage gets made."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"It's sexy stuff."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"I feel like we got to know you even better."
01:05:17;01:05:21;"Even after so many years of doing this show, I feel closer to you than ever."
01:05:21;01:05:25;"I think my favorite one was the National Parks one."
01:05:25;01:05:31;"What did you like about that one? Is that like an unexplored, untapped side of the Jake world?"
01:05:31;01:05:36;"Yeah, you can just go down the road next to your life and just be like, ""Oh yeah, I've traveled there. I went there."""
01:05:36;01:05:39;"I used to do a lot more camping and stuff than I do now."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"That reminds me of the other thing that I think about all the time."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"What's that?"
01:05:43;01:05:49;"From this show, the two things I think about are you eating the Snickers"
01:05:49;01:05:56;"and another one, which was a conversation between you and Ezra years ago about going on a hike."
01:05:56;01:06:01;"Ezra asking if he could wear headphones on the hike and listen to music."
01:06:01;01:06:04;"There was some conversation where you're like, ""No. What are you, insane?"""
01:06:04;01:06:06;"Do you remember this?"
01:06:06;01:06:12;"It was the idea that two friends would go on a hike and Ezra was like, ""I don't really go on a lot of hikes."""
01:06:12;01:06:16;"He's like, ""If we go on a hike together, could I wear headphones?"""
01:06:16;01:06:18;"You were like, ""No."""
01:06:18;01:06:25;"The idea of two friends on a hike but not talking, where one or both are listening to a pod or music"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"is taking me all the time."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Wow."
01:06:28;01:06:31;"The conversation dwindles, turn around."
01:06:31;01:06:36;"You've been in front about 10 minutes, turn back, you see your buddy, headphones on."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"What are you listening to?"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Rogan."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"New Rogan."
01:06:41;01:06:47;"You're like, ""Oh, sorry. We hadn't been talking for a couple of minutes. I thought I could just put on Rogan."""
01:06:47;01:06:54;"You're walking in silence for 10 minutes and then you're like, ""I've been meaning to ask you, how are things with your dad?"""
01:06:54;01:06:58;"Silence, turn around."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Should we do the top five?"
01:07:00;01:07:07;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:07:07;01:07:14;"We are joined by Rashida Jones. Ezra, because of his laryngitis, is off the show."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Forever."
01:07:15;01:07:20;"He's in the showers early tonight, so we're going to let him rest his voice."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"We're going to do a Generation X top five. We've done this before."
01:07:24;01:07:30;"We're going to do the rock charts versus the R&B charts of 1995."
01:07:30;01:07:35;"I guess this week in 1995, which is pretty much when I graduated high school."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"I graduated high school in June of '95."
01:07:38;01:07:46;"That's what I was going to ask. June of '95, and this is May. You are rocking out this week."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Senioritis, full effect."
01:07:48;01:07:54;"You are not studying. You're not even going to class. You're probably only listening to music at this point, right?"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"Absolutely. Yep."
01:07:56;01:08:05;"I was a sophomore. I feel like I listened to a lot less radio. A sophomore in college, I listened to a lot less radio in college."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"As you do."
01:08:06;01:08:17;"As you do. But I was in an a cappella group and we had our signature song was the '80s smash hit, ""Let the Music Play"" by Shannon."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"Do you remember that song?"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"How does it go?"
01:08:20;01:08:23;"♪ Let the music play, don't get away ♪"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Great song."
01:08:24;01:08:32;"We'd sing that, but we used that as a radio station. We would insert songs that were popular that month."
01:08:32;01:08:39;"That was really the only reason I had to listen to the radios because I had to know what to put into ""Let the Music Play."""
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Did you graduate high school in '93?"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"'93."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Wow. Okay."
01:08:43;01:08:54;"I was out there being an adult. You were just living the free life. No, it's not true. Anyway, yes. We'll see. I hope that I know what's happening."
01:08:54;01:09:00;"The couple times Ezra's come back to me with '93, '92, I was in the pocket."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"You tapped it."
01:09:01;01:09:04;"I'm driving to school. Yeah."
01:09:04;01:09:13;"Okay. Well, let's start with The Rock. Number five this week on The Rock Charts, ""Collective Soul."" Oh, wait. Sorry. You're going to try to guess."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"I'm never going to guess The Rock Charts, so save R&B for me."
01:09:17;01:09:22;"From now on, you're going to try to guess both R&B and rock. But number five, I already blew it, ""Collective Soul."""
01:09:22;01:09:23;"What's that?"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"With ""December."""
01:09:25;01:09:32;"♪"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Is this ringing a bell?"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"♪"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"Do you even think you've heard of ""Collective Soul""?"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Does the name?"
01:09:40;01:09:46;"I think I heard that name, but I probably thought it was, sorry, ""Soulful?"" Like, ""Soul?"""
01:09:46;01:09:51;"♪"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Have you heard of ""Soul Asylum?"""
01:09:53;01:10:04;"Oh, ""Soul Asylum,"" yes. But there's, yeah, ""Collective Soul"" really sounds like they should have done a song with, like, brand new heavies. Like, it really sounds
like not this."
01:10:04;01:10:09;"You couldn't call a rock band ""Collective Soul,"" I don't think, in 2023. I don't think that's happening, you know?"
01:10:09;01:10:20;"♪"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"Jesus."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Nope."
01:10:22;01:10:27;"That's one of the most, like, kind of stereotypical '90s songs."
01:10:27;01:10:33;"Yeah, his, that, what, that affectation, ""Bah, ooh, ee,"" that's familiar to me, for sure."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"""The Hermyarl."""
01:10:35;01:10:37;"""The Hermyarl."" This should have been on ""The Hermyarl."""
01:10:37;01:10:40;"Oh, yeah, ""Hermyarl,"" yeah."
01:10:40;01:10:44;"We did a whole episode about this, that affectation."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"""Hermyarl."" Did you guys name that?"
01:10:46;01:10:52;"Jack Indino, who produced, I want to say he produced the first Nirvana album."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Wow."
01:10:53;01:11:01;"Along with, like, Mudhoney and stuff, called in to discuss ""Hermyarl"" as a cultural kind of touchstone of the era."
01:11:01;01:11:08;"This is interesting to me because, like, of course I know Nirvana. Of course it feels like a part of my growing up."
01:11:08;01:11:18;"But, like, when you're not in the genre, you're only going to get touched by, like, the top, top, top innovation, like, the best version of that thing."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"You're not going to, you're not sliding, you're not listening to all of it."
01:11:21;01:11:25;"But, '90s R&B, I heard all of it. I know all of it. You know what I mean?"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"And you probably know all of this. ""Hermyarl."""
01:11:27;01:11:32;"Yeah, I know all of it. I mean, I know all this, like, radio rock, '90s radio rock."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Yeah."
01:11:33;01:11:37;"I didn't like this at the time. I mean, even at the time, I was sort of like, ""This is fake."""
01:11:37;01:11:39;"And now? How do you feel about it?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"It's terrible."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"[laughs]"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"It's not good."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Okay."
01:11:44;01:11:50;"All right, let's move on to number five this week. May of '95 on the R&B charts."
01:12:00;01:12:04;"It's so good. I don't know what it is. Oh, wait."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"Oh, it's ""Brownstone,"" right?"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"Yep."
01:12:16;01:12:19;"And it's their second single."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Grade five."
01:12:31;01:12:38;"My first job, like, my first real job—that's why I probably know this song, because summer of my freshman year,"
01:12:38;01:12:46;"I was an intern for Barney's Public Relations, Barney's New York, RIP."
01:12:46;01:12:56;"And my job was to dress groups, or to help dress groups for, like, Barney's, like, after-hours, like, club called Mad '61,"
01:12:56;01:13:03;"which was in the basement of Barney's on Madison 61st. And ""Brownstone"" was one of the groups. And I was very excited."
01:13:16;01:13:23;"I don't know this song. I feel like I'll probably know a fair amount of the R&B, because I was a liverist radio listener at the time."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"That's right. This is a deep cut."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"This is not ringing a bell."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"But I think going forward, I'm going to try to guess the rock, too."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Okay, cool."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"We'll have a guess-off."
01:13:34;01:13:38;"Should I—I wish—I can't do—"
01:13:38;01:13:42;"No, it's all good. If I can't get it, I'll scroll."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"Okay."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"So the number four rock song."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"Bon Jovi?"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Ooh."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Is that ""Soul Asylum""?"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Okay."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Oh my gosh."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"[laughter]"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"""Soul Asylum."""
01:14:17;01:14:18;"""Soul to Soul."""
01:14:23;01:14:24;"This song is called ""Nip/Nip."""
01:14:24;01:14:27;"What is this group? What's the deal here?"
01:14:27;01:14:41;"""Soul Asylum""—they're from Minneapolis, and they put out a bunch of records on Twin Tone, which is like a Minnesota-based kind of like hardcore and punk label in the
'80s."
01:14:41;01:14:48;"And then they like—this is like their fifth or sixth album, I think, and it was a huge commercial hit."
01:14:48;01:14:52;"It kind of just rode the wave and crested it, right?"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"As alternative music was like—"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"And you would know ""Runaway Train."""
01:14:56;01:14:57;"Yeah, you know ""Runaway Train."""
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Would I, though? Would I?"
01:14:59;01:15:03;"Yeah, no, I think you—no, you have to—yeah, Matt, would you put this on?"
01:15:03;01:15:07;"This would—this is too pervasive."
01:15:07;01:15:11;"""Runaway Train""—it had the pictures of the missing kids."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"This is probably '93, I would guess."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Yes, I do know this song."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"Can I say something that might be controversial?"
01:15:37;01:15:45;"I know that this is like what was like cool in the mid-'90s, but does it—vocally, isn't this like very similar to like hair bands?"
01:15:45;01:15:50;"Like, I feel like the vocal—the timbre is very similar."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"I think that's an interesting observation."
01:15:52;01:16:01;"I think with ""Soul Asylum,"" definitely, that sort of like ""crackin' voice"" kind of thing, it's not that far off from like ""Faster Pussycat"" or like—"
01:16:01;01:16:05;"even like a Motley Crue ballad or something."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"I was thinking Motley Crue."
01:16:07;01:16:11;"I've never actually thought of that, but not having heard this music in a long time—"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"They would hate that. They would hate that, right?"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"That would be like the worst thing you could say. Okay, cool."
01:16:17;01:16:22;"But again, I mean, ""Soul Asylum"" is like—I mean, not a great band."
01:16:22;01:16:29;"And I think maybe that—maybe the fact that it reminds you of like the music that they would have hated from the '80s kind of shows the—"
01:16:29;01:16:33;"betrays the sort of thinness of the vision."
01:16:33;01:16:36;"It's sort of like they had different window dressing on."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Narcissism of small differences."
01:16:38;01:16:41;"There we go. Classic TC concept."
01:16:41;01:16:45;"All right, let's move on. Number four on the R&B charts."
01:16:45;01:16:48;"You just don't know what you do to me."
01:16:48;01:16:52;"Oh, yeah. ""Total"" and ""Biggie,"" ""Can't You See?"""
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Classic."
01:16:53;01:17:04;"This song was stuck in my head for like an entire two years."
01:17:04;01:17:07;"And every time I'd take a shower, I would sing this song."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"Sticky, this song."
01:17:11;01:17:19;"This was like heyday New York, too."
01:17:19;01:17:25;"Like the couple times—like I wasn't going to school in New York, but when I'd go there in the summers or for the weekend,"
01:17:25;01:17:35;"there was kind of no better place in the world because it was like Club USA, the Tunnel, Funkmaster Flex."
01:17:35;01:17:39;"East Coast, West Coast beef hadn't totally popped off yet."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Right."
01:17:40;01:17:44;"So like people could still be in a club together and it wouldn't be a problem, you know?"
01:17:44;01:17:49;"So you would go into New York when you're a college student and like go to clubs and like dance all night?"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Yeah."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"I've never done that."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"Really?"
01:17:54;01:17:57;"I've never gone to a club and danced all night."
01:17:57;01:18:00;"Oh, well, that's—have you ever gone to a club and danced?"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"No."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"Let's start there."
01:18:02;01:18:06;"I've never been to a club and danced."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"We've got to change that, Jake."
01:18:07;01:18:09;"Oh, yeah, I know this song. This is a cool one."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"This is good."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"I remember this now."
01:18:12;01:18:15;"You know what's crazy? I think I told this story once on the show."
01:18:15;01:18:22;"I saw a Notorious B.I.G. show at UConn in Storrs, Connecticut in May of '96."
01:18:22;01:18:26;"I think weeks or months before he died. I think he died in '96."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Wow."
01:18:27;01:18:35;"It was the Violent Femmes and Notorious B.I.G. co-headlining at a campus concert."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Wow."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"Random."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Did he freestyle?"
01:18:40;01:18:44;"I couldn't tell you. I'm sure. I don't—I didn't really know what I—"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"Just make it up. You can say whatever you want and we'll believe you."
01:18:46;01:18:53;"Exactly. Oh, yeah, no, he—it was incredible. He did a 40-minute freestyle."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"Unbroken chain. It was unbelievable."
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Let's go."
01:19:12;01:19:16;"The number—what do we got? The number three rock song this week."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"Let's see if I can guess."
01:19:31;01:19:34;"Oh, I think I know this song."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"Is this Elastica?"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:20:02;01:20:06;"Now, is Elastica—what's her name?"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Elastica."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"Yeah, but who's the lead singer?"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Oh, Justine Frischmann."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"Right."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Is that who the singer is? Okay."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Justine some—no."
01:20:29;01:20:34;"Happen to hear some female representation on the charts here."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"There we go."
01:20:35;01:20:39;"So far on R&B, it's been both of them, maybe, so."
01:20:39;01:20:45;"Yeah, I never was a huge fan of this song, but it's—it sounds pretty fresh right now."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"It sounds good."
01:20:47;01:20:51;"It sounds so much like, you know—"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Hole?"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Have you listened to that?"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"Oh, no."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"But, you know, this band Wet Leg, you know, that's really popular now."
01:20:57;01:21:01;"I mean, there's—whatever this is, it feels like there's something that feels fresh."
01:21:01;01:21:06;"I was going to say earlier, like, some of the students' songs have come out, like, last year."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"So that song ""Ring the Bell"" for you, Rashida?"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like that song."
01:21:11;01:21:16;"Were you throwing on the alt-rock station on the drive from Massachusetts down in New York?"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"No."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"[Laughs]"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"No."
01:21:19;01:21:20;"No, no, no."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"No."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"But you heard it somehow. MTV or—I don't know."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"Yeah, maybe. Like, yeah, exactly."
01:21:27;01:21:31;"Like, how would I have listened to music? Maybe, like, I had friends."
01:21:31;01:21:36;"You know, I had some friends with diverse music taste in college, you know?"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"Right."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"That was a big song."
01:21:38;01:21:43;"Okay, the number three song on the 100 Metre—"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"Jake keeps the train—he keeps that train running."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"That's right."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Just one of them days."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Runaway train."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"Yeah, the train."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Just one of them days."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"Yeah."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Just one of them days."
01:21:54;01:22:02;"This is not a Dina Howard—no, it's—oh, we just listened—Ezra and I just listened to this song because he didn't know the song."
01:22:02;01:22:10;"And fun fact, my brother produced the LL Cool J song that's sampled in this song."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Whoa."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Backseat of my Jeep."
01:22:13;01:22:16;"So my brother's, like, credited as a producer on this song."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"It's not a Dina—what's her name?"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Is this her name's sidebar?"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"This is Monica."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"Oh, Monica."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"Monica, right."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"No, no, not Monica."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Monifa."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Not Monica."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"No, no, it's Monica."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Is it Monica?"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"It's credited to her."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Oh, my God."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Just one of them days."
01:22:34;01:22:39;"That a girl goes through when I'm angry inside."
01:22:39;01:22:42;"Don't wanna take it out on you."
01:22:42;01:22:45;"Just one of them days."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"Don't take it personal."
01:22:48;01:22:51;"I just wanna be all alone."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Do you think I treat you?"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"Don't take it personal."
01:22:56;01:23:02;"Interesting, though, Monica's cousin, she has two cousins."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"I'm sure she has many."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"But one is Ludacris, and the other is Polo the Don."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"So this is a real music—"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Wow, what a family."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"This is a real heavy music family, yeah."
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Atlanta music family."
01:23:14;01:23:20;"I really wanna be with you the whole way through."
01:23:20;01:23:24;"Monica must have been really young when this song came out."
01:23:24;01:23:27;"'Cause this is pre-Boy Is Mine."
01:23:27;01:23:31;"She's born in '80, so she's 42."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"So what year is this?"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"'95."
01:23:33;01:23:34;"I was 15."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"15 years old."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"That's crazy."
01:23:37;01:23:42;"I was also saying to Ezra that this song is kind of like a song about your menstrual cycle."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"I mean, that's at least how it feels for a woman."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Like, don't take it personal."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"It's just one of them days."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"I wanna be all alone."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"That a girl goes through when I'm angry inside."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"Wow, I love that."
01:23:53;01:23:57;"Do you think it's literally about that, or you just interpret it that way?"
01:23:57;01:24:02;"I never thought it wasn't about that, but I've never done any investigation."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"You haven't done a close read on the lyrics."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"No, I haven't."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"I haven't, but it all works."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"Yeah."
01:24:08;01:24:14;"I remember being in junior high school, though, and my friends and I being like, ""You know what this song is about, right?"""
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Really?"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"Yeah, I think it's really—I think you're right."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"I think it's a thing."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"How great."
01:24:21;01:24:25;"I'm so happy to have a song for that specific time of the month."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I mean, how great."
01:24:27;01:24:32;"Maybe it's about PMS, not even about having your period."
01:24:32;01:24:35;"I love discussing this with a bunch of dudes."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"That's good."
01:24:36;01:24:42;"Don't take it personal."
01:24:42;01:24:47;"Don't take it personal."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"Don't take it personal."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"I'm on Monica's Twitter."
01:24:52;01:25:01;"Looks like in 2018, Monica did an AMA, and somebody curiously asked, ""Monica, were you singing about being on your period?"""
01:25:01;01:25:04;"On quote, ""Don't take it personal,"" just one of them days."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"And Monica replies, ""Not at all."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"I didn't even have one back then."""
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Crying emoji."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"""I was 12 when we recorded that song."
01:25:11;01:25:15;"It was about an all caps BAD DAY LOL."""
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Wow."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"Oh my—she was 12?"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"She recorded it at 12."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"I guess it came out years later?"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"I mean, it came out when she was 15."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"I don't even know what to say."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"How does she sound like that at 12?"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"That's, first of all, what I want to know."
01:25:29;01:25:34;"How does she have all that life in her voice at 12?"
01:25:34;01:25:38;"Could she be—oh, somebody replies, ""Wasn't it released when you were 15, 16?"""
01:25:38;01:25:39;"Maybe she's exaggerating."
01:25:39;01:25:44;"Maybe she's doing a little bit of hyperbole, like, ""I was a baby."""
01:25:44;01:25:52;"It's still the sophistication for a 15-year-old of, like, ""How many BAD DAYS can you have at 15?"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"You're 15."""
01:25:53;01:25:54;"You know?"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"That's true."
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Wow."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Wow, that's wild."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Okay."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"I stand corrected."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"Rashida, you know what song I always liked by Monica was—do you know?"
01:26:02;01:26:06;"It came a few years later, but ""The First Night"" featuring Jermaine Dupri, where she"
01:26:06;01:26:10;"talks about not getting down on the first night."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Oh."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"Do you know that one?"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"I don't know that one."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"Oh."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"Oh, that's a good one."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"It's from one of her later albums."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"So you're a Monica head type of—"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Oh, and it's got a little Love Hangover sample?"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Yes, it's samples of Love Hangover, yeah."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Jermaine Dupri."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"Oh, I love this song."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"It's so good."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"This is a banger."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Great message."
01:26:39;01:26:45;"This album had ""Angel of Mine"" on it and ""Street Symphony"" and ""Boyz Mine"" was on this one."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"Monica's—she's a legend."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"We need to give her props, you know?"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Give her her flowers."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"Because she also doesn't sound like anybody else."
01:26:55;01:27:04;"So what year is this, Minneapolis?"
01:27:04;01:27:08;"Oh, man, this must have been '98."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"It's not even that far after that."
01:27:10;01:27:15;"There was also a singer named Monifa that came out at the same time, and I remember—"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"because you know you always remember, like, there's two—"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"there was like Jay-Z and AZ."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"There was Monica and Monica."
01:27:20;01:27:25;"You always remember that we were like, ""Well, whatever happened, you know."""
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Yeah."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"I remember Monifa."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"""Touch It."""
01:27:30;01:27:31;"""Touch It."""
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Yes!"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"That's not like the first night."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"That's like, ""Go ahead and touch it."""
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Yeah, that's the anti-first night."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"That's a different—"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Yeah."
01:27:40;01:27:45;"Uh, okay."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"The number two rock song."
01:27:47;01:27:54;"Oh, I know this song."
01:27:54;01:28:02;"Is this like Weezer?"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Oh, no."
01:28:03;01:28:06;"It reminds me of ""Third Eye Blind,"" but it's not ""Third Eye Blind."""
01:28:06;01:28:07;"It's ""The Poor Third Eye Blind."""
01:28:32;01:28:33;"Matthew Sweet?"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Matthew who?"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Matthew Sweet."
01:28:36;01:28:40;"I just pulled that out of the deepest recesses of my subconscious."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Wow."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"You have to go take a nap now."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"That's crazy."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"This sounds amazing."
01:28:45;01:28:51;"Who's Matthew Sweet?"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"Just like a power pop kind of songwriter guy."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"I don't know much about him."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Maybe he's—he might be Canadian."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"Is that what a number fan said?"
01:28:59;01:29:03;"No, you're thinking of Matthew Good, of the Matthew Good Band."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"Matthew Sweet, I don't think, is Canadian."
01:29:06;01:29:08;"He's the guy that put out some records."
01:29:08;01:29:13;"There's a million guys like this that write these kind of like, yeah, just kind of poppy rock songs."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"This sounds good to me."
01:29:14;01:29:18;"The cover of this album is so good."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"You just need to look at this."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"What's it called, the album?"
01:29:20;01:29:25;"It's ""100% Fun,"" which is a great name for an album."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"I'm going to blast this album on the drive home."
01:29:30;01:29:41;"Oh, you know what?"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"That's so funny."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"Ezra has almost an identical picture to this."
01:29:45;01:29:50;"Maybe every kid from this era has that picture where like, it's them with like headphones"
01:29:50;01:29:54;"and they're like, kind of like brown-toned study."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Maybe that's a common picture."
01:29:56;01:30:00;"""100% Fun"" comes from a line in Kurt Cobain's ""Suicide."""
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Wow."
01:30:01;01:30:09;"The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I was having 100% fun."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Damn, Matthew."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"He went there."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Damn, Matthew."
01:30:12;01:30:13;"I hope he's okay."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"I mean, I get like a really sunny vibe from his music."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"I mean, I hope he is too."
01:30:17;01:30:22;"Yeah, he has this other big hit called ""Girlfriend"" from '91."
01:30:22;01:30:25;"Anyway, I'm kind of intrigued by Matthew Sweet right now."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"I think I need to go down a rabbit hole with this later."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Get involved."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"That's cool."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"That was number two."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"What a strange week."
01:30:32;01:30:33;"I mean, I don't know."
01:30:33;01:30:34;"I know nothing about rock."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Why am I saying that?"
01:30:35;01:30:39;"It's strange for me because I don't know any of the songs."
01:30:39;01:30:45;"I'm surprised that that song, I mean, Matthew Sweet was not like nearly as famous as like"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"""Soul Asylum"" or ""Collective Soul"" or even ""Elastica."""
01:30:48;01:30:50;"I'm surprised that's on there."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"Good for Matt."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Want to contest?"
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Would you like to contest?"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Is it too late?"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Do I want to contest if that's factually accurate?"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"No, just that why would that be on there?"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Maybe talk to Billboard?"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Talk to the gods?"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Talk to the chart gods?"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Talk to the rock gods?"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"Yeah."
01:31:10;01:31:14;"The number two song is a classic."
01:31:14;01:31:16;"You'll know it instantly."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"This is so exciting."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"This is how we do it?"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"Is this how we do it, Montel Jordan?"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Just from the studio chatter."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Just from the chatter."
01:31:26;01:31:30;"This is how we do it."
01:31:30;01:31:34;"La la la la la."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"La la la la la."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"This is how we do it."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I know this is a party song."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Yes, I know it gets everybody going."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"I would dance to this song."
01:31:44;01:31:46;"This was never a favorite of mine."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"Really?"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Friday night."
01:31:48;01:31:52;"It's just not cool."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"Westside."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"There's just something about the way he pronounces words."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"It's just not cool."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Keys to my truck."
01:31:58;01:32:02;"It's very clear in the notation."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"It feels so good."
01:32:04;01:32:08;"It's also, the vocals are also really hot."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Trebly."
01:32:12;01:32:19;"It's like he's doing a very idiosyncratic read and they're really pushing the levels."
01:32:19;01:32:22;"It's just not cool."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"There's no chill in this song."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"It's nice of you to say it."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"It's a very nerdy vocal."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"It's nerdy."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Everybody loves this song."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"It's a wedding song."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"Instant wedding classic."
01:32:36;01:32:39;"Don't disrespect."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"It gets the party going."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"He's really tall, Montel Jordan, right?"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Isn't he super tall?"
01:32:45;01:32:46;"This just blew my mind."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Montel Jordan, 6'8""?"
01:32:48;01:32:49;"What?"
01:32:49;01:32:52;"Hey, more like Michael Jordan."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Yeah."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"All right."
01:32:55;01:33:01;"That's why they call him Seinfeld 2000."
01:33:01;01:33:04;"Good night, everybody."
01:33:04;01:33:12;"Actually, by the way, as Matt pointed out, much taller than Michael Jordan."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Oh, true."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"6'6""?"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Michael Jordan 6'6""?"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Yeah."
01:33:17;01:33:18;"That's amazing."
01:33:18;01:33:23;"6'8"" is uncomfortably tall."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Yeah."
01:33:24;01:33:28;"You have to shop at a different store."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Medical curiosity."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Ducking through doorways and stuff."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"Montel Jordan has a quote about his song."
01:33:37;01:33:43;"""I came up with the idea, this universal idea, if you're in China, this is how they do it."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Here."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"If you're from the ghetto, this is how they do it there."
01:33:47;01:33:50;"If you're from New York, you do it like this."""
01:33:50;01:33:54;"I think the reason the song was such a big smash with everybody is because everyone from"
01:33:54;01:33:59;"different countries, gay, straight, whatever color, everybody does their individual way"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"of doing what they do."
01:34:01;01:34:05;"Actually, I would say that's deep as shit."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"I really think that's like, he's smart."
01:34:07;01:34:13;"He did something vague enough that everybody could be like, ""Yeah, this is how we do it."""
01:34:13;01:34:14;"Smart, very smart."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"It is a great lyric."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"This is how we do it."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"Yeah."
01:34:18;01:34:20;"Everybody has Friday night."
01:34:20;01:34:21;"Everybody."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"You party."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"When you don't do it, you're doing it."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"You know what I mean?"
01:34:26;01:34:34;"You could be alone in your apartment on a Friday night, eating Pompano's, chugging Miller High"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Life, and just being like-"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Hold on, hold on, hold on."
01:34:37;01:34:41;"No, because there's an implication that you went to another person."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"You can't do it alone."
01:34:43;01:34:47;"You have to be able to at least your cat, somebody."
01:34:47;01:34:51;"This is how I do it."
01:34:51;01:34:57;"Do y'all remember the short-lived Howie Mandel prank show, How We Do It?"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"H-O-W-I-E."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"Not Ring a Bell."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"Of course, I remember."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"You remember that?"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"I don't like that pun."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"I don't like it."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Okay."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"All right."
01:35:06;01:35:10;"It's just, it's not the same part of speech."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"It doesn't work for me."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"You're saying you can't parse it."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Okay, it doesn't play."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"How we do it."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"Oh, actually, How We Do It, it is a nice double entendre, but-"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"So you want to know why?"
01:35:21;01:35:27;"The reason I remember that is I made the show called Delocated with John Glazer."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"You might remember it."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"I know Ezra."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"I love that show."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Ezra was a fan."
01:35:31;01:35:40;"John Glazer, and the reason I know How We Do It, thank you, is that John Glazer hated that pun, How We Do It,"
01:35:40;01:35:45;"so much that he made an episode called This Is How John Does It."
01:35:45;01:35:49;"And his thing, where he had a prank show, and every time he pranks somebody, he goes,"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"""This is how Johnny do it,"" I think, or just, ""This is how John does it."""
01:35:53;01:35:54;"And they're like, ""It doesn't work."""
01:35:54;01:35:59;"But the whole prank show was him going, ""This is how John does it."""
01:35:59;01:36:01;"[Laughter]"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"This is how John does it."
01:36:03;01:36:10;"Because he was so irked by the How We Do It."
01:36:10;01:36:14;"Jeke, why do you keep instinctively changing the rhythm of that?"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"This is how John does it."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"You're adding like a-"
01:36:18;01:36:22;"The beauty of that song is, ""This is how we do it."""
01:36:22;01:36:25;"It's so like, there's no extra flourish there."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"That's a great question."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"I don't know."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"I thought I was singing it accurately."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"You've been going on a vocal run on the last-"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I like it, though."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"He doesn't want to end."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"This is going to come as a shock."
01:36:39;01:36:43;"I'm not the most musically talented person on earth."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"You're in a band."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"What are you talking about?"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Wait, if I was just going to try to sing it."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"Do it."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"♪ This is how we do it ♪"
01:36:50;01:36:51;"That's not how it goes."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Well, you're adding an extra syllable to the do."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"So, should he go, ""This is how we do it."""
01:36:56;01:36:57;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Yeah, it's universal."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"It's universal."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"I don't know why-"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"You're making it more complicated than it is."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"I don't know why I'm doing that."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"In my head, that's how it goes."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"That's crazy."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"I like your version."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"I like your version, too, actually."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"Oh, thanks, guys."
01:37:13;01:37:15;"That's really supportive."
01:37:15;01:37:20;"Anyway, I really think that's an interesting analysis you're bringing of his vocal performance."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"That would not have occurred to me."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"No disrespect to Montel Jordan."
01:37:24;01:37:28;"I really don't want to disrespect him, but it just compared to the things at the time."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Everybody's just kind of like-"
01:37:30;01:37:35;"Everybody in every video was wearing sunglasses and sitting on the hood of a car like they were about to take a nap."
01:37:35;01:37:42;"And he's so forward in his vocals, and he's just hitting it so hard."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"It's Friday."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"It's Friday night."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"I think you're right."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"There's a sort of-"
01:37:48;01:37:53;"Where everything else, like Monica, there's not even a natural, it's very cool."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"And maybe that's why it's also like a wedding song."
01:37:56;01:37:59;"It's coming out very hard."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"It's trying very hard."
01:38:01;01:38:05;"I'm going to guess that this song was on the charts for a very long time."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"You're right."
01:38:07;01:38:10;"It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Wow."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Remained at number one for seven consecutive weeks."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"It also was number one seven weeks on the R&B Singles Chart."
01:38:17;01:38:20;"But it was released in February of '95."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"So here we are in late May."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"It's two."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"It's number two."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"So, yeah."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"You know what also has no chill?"
01:38:30;01:38:31;"Iconic song from '95."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"Tell me."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"I was going to mention another one."
01:38:33;01:38:34;"Nick, you go first."
01:38:34;01:38:41;"I was going to just say what's not very chill is his line, ""Designated driver, take the keys to my truck."""
01:38:41;01:38:45;"He was paid by the government to make this song."
01:38:45;01:38:51;"He's entering the party, and he's like, ""I'm getting so f---ed up tonight."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Let's go."""
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Although the rhythm of that's really good."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"""Designated driver, take the keys to my truck."""
01:38:55;01:38:56;"That's pretty good."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"It's great."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"It's just the sentiment isn't cool."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"No."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"Well, he's preaching safety, though."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Again, not leaning on it."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"No, that's not cool."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Oh, I see what you're saying."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"But it's not cool."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"It's good."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"It's not laid back."
01:39:09;01:39:10;"It's great."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"It's responsible."
01:39:11;01:39:15;"He's entering the party, and he's like, ""I'm getting so f---ed up tonight."""
01:39:15;01:39:17;"It's a wedding energy."
01:39:17;01:39:22;"It's hard to picture Snoop rapping about a designated driver."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Designated drivers, definitely."
01:39:24;01:39:31;"Is your issue that he is preemptively calling out the designated driver before even the party commences?"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"He's planning ahead."
01:39:33;01:39:37;"He's not sloppy drunk like, ""Ah, somebody."""
01:39:37;01:39:40;"And he's not even halfway through the party, being like, ""You know what?"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"I think things are pretty going."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"I'm talking to this girl."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Things are going well."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"Hey, buddy, just take the keys because I don't want to drive out."""
01:39:46;01:39:49;"He's literally entering the party and being like, ""Let's go."""
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Stone cold sober."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"He's stone cold sober."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"It's a guy who's having a bad—it's going to be a bad night."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"There's no way for the night to end well."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"It's either going to be as fun as he thinks it's going to be."
01:40:00;01:40:03;"And I think that's what you're hearing the vocal performance of Rashida saying."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"This is so much more compelling now, this whole narrative."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"This guy is—it's Friday night."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"He's been working like a dog all week."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"He's pent up."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"He's ready to cut loose."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"He's just rage, man."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"He's ready to be raved."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"It's true."
01:40:19;01:40:24;"The second—the second had the sequel to the song would be a very, very dark scenario"
01:40:24;01:40:30;"where he comes and he's like the life of the party and it goes so south so fast."
01:40:30;01:40:35;"And for like the police and possibly like an EMT is involved later in the night."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"Oh, it's like—"
01:40:36;01:40:40;"He drinks too much too quickly and he doesn't eat his dinner, you know?"
01:40:40;01:40:43;"No, it's like real—it's like super bad energy."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"It's like high school party."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"Yeah."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"Blacking out."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"It's f***ing—"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Blacking out like really blowing it with a girl."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"Like embarrassing, like not remembering anything."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"People have been like, ""Ooh, did you see Montel?"""
01:40:56;01:40:57;"""Ooh, yeah."""
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Don't tell them."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Did you talk to Montel last night?"
01:41:01;01:41:05;"Somehow he gets to the 7-Eleven at like 3 in the morning with his boys."
01:41:05;01:41:10;"He's like microwaving a burrito in the 7-Eleven and just blows chunks all over the aisle."
01:41:10;01:41:13;"""This is how we do it."""
01:41:13;01:41:18;"Oh my God."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Oh God."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Yeah."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"No."
01:41:22;01:41:28;"I'm glad that at least you guys feel the energy that I've—I intuited as a young person."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"There was something just not quite—"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"I wasn't going to make it through the night, you know?"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"This is an early in the night song."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"Yeah."
01:41:35;01:41:39;"This is not, you know, peak drunkness."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"The sun is still out."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"This is not ""I get knocked out,"" you know what I mean?"
01:41:42;01:41:45;"Like that sounds like we're drunk."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"Yeah."
01:41:46;01:41:50;"Yeah, it's still light out."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Yeah, it's still daylight."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Yeah."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"7-Eleven."
01:41:56;01:42:00;"Montel got to the party like 10 minutes early."
01:42:00;01:42:04;"And his friends are like, ""We can't go in yet."""
01:42:04;01:42:05;"He's so hungry."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"The party didn't start until 7 and no one's really getting there until like 8.30."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"He's so hungry."
01:42:10;01:42:15;"Really good parking."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"You know, I found parking right up front."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"It's really easy."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"Also, who's the designated driver?"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"Did he come with him?"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Because he's right there."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Right."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"Usually you're like, you have to find somebody."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"You're like, ""Please, please save me from myself."""
01:42:33;01:42:35;"He brought someone."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"He planned ahead."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"I mean, it was a big night for him."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"Like literally designated, like well-planned."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"24 hours in advance."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"You're not drinking tonight, right?"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"He hit him up on his pager."
01:42:48;01:42:50;"They had a conversation the night before."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Yeah."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Oh."
01:42:52;01:42:58;"He's paying his younger cousin to be the DD."
01:42:58;01:43:00;"No, he's not even paying."
01:43:00;01:43:02;"He's like, ""Listen, I'm going to a real cool party."
01:43:02;01:43:06;"All you got to do is be there for me to take me home, okay?"""
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Oh, totally."
01:43:07;01:43:11;"And that's the kid who looks back and goes, ""God, my older cousin wasn't that cool."""
01:43:11;01:43:13;"You know, that's the moment when everything changed for him."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"He's like, ""Ooh."""
01:43:14;01:43:15;"Yeah."
01:43:15;01:43:18;"Yeah, it's like the first time they've ever hung out outside of like Thanksgiving dinner."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Exactly."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"And you're like, ""Oh, this would be cool."""
01:43:21;01:43:24;"Older cousin and, ""Oh my God, this guy's a dork."""
01:43:24;01:43:29;"Feels like the song's going to have like a full-time crisis spin-off show."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"Yeah."
01:43:30;01:43:34;"Like a six-part series on ""This Is How We Do It."""
01:43:34;01:43:38;"Yeah, this is approaching Shape of You level analysis at this point."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Oh my God."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Oh, Shape of You."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Is that Ashley Simpson?"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"No, it's not."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"No."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"You're thinking of Pieces of Me?"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Pieces of Me."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"Shape of You."
01:43:50;01:43:55;"We spent like six episodes talking about Ed Sheeran's Shape of You once."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"This is like-"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"That's when they're eating Chinese food."
01:43:58;01:44:03;"You probably don't have like a first-hand grasp on the lyrics of Shape of You, Rashida,"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"but it's about-"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"Is that the one he's getting sued for?"
01:44:06;01:44:07;"No."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"No, that was different."
01:44:08;01:44:11;"But they're eating Chinese food in the cab."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Ew, what?"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"Why?"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"In the cab?"
01:44:14;01:44:18;"He's on a date and he gets takeout."
01:44:18;01:44:23;"They go to Chinese food and he takes out some of it on the date is one of the parts of the"
01:44:23;01:44:24;"song."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"I'm out."
01:44:26;01:44:29;"I don't know what you're talking about."
01:44:29;01:44:33;"The number one rock song."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"One."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"Number one."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Here we go, folks."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"Number one rock song."
01:44:37;01:44:45;"Well, we've had the namesake of the show over there."
01:44:45;01:44:50;"This is Better Than Ezra with their song Good."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Wow."
01:44:51;01:44:57;"Okay."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"I love hearing this after the montel."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"I was going to say, very similar vocal performance."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"Same problem."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"No chill."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"He's trying very hard to sing well."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Yeah."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"You hear it."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"Yeah."
01:45:13;01:45:22;"I've never heard this song before."
01:45:22;01:45:36;"I knew there was a band called Better Than Ezra."
01:45:36;01:46:03;"It's the opposite of this is how we do it because he's just alone at home."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"But at least it feels like better."
01:46:05;01:46:11;"I feel better about him being this unchill and being alone."
01:46:11;01:46:16;"Yeah, no, I think it's sort of the over performance works if you're alone."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"You know, yeah, there's something about the month."
01:46:19;01:46:24;"So you remember like the 40 year old virgin when Steve Carell is like trying to like describe"
01:46:24;01:46:28;"like sex and like, oh, he's like, oh, yeah, breasts are like a bag of sand or something."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"He just has never."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"He doesn't have any reference point."
01:46:30;01:46:35;"Yeah, there's something about Montel Jordan having never been to a party."
01:46:35;01:46:39;"And he's like, describe describing because when I was reading the rest of lyrics, so"
01:46:39;01:46:44;"I reached for my 40 and I turn it up designated driver, take the keys to my truck, hit the"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"shore because I'm faded."
01:46:46;01:46:49;"Honey's in the street being like, Monty, yo, we made it."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:46:50;01:46:51;"It's like, oh, none of that."
01:46:51;01:46:54;"So is she the designated driver?"
01:46:54;01:46:55;"I hope not."
01:46:55;01:46:59;"I mean, even that's like, it seems like they know she no one's having fun."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"That's yeah, that's such a bummer."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"You're like, turn your girlfriend."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"You're like, you're driving, right?"
01:47:03;01:47:08;"And by the way, calling her your designated driver, a designated driver."
01:47:08;01:47:12;"I thought we were on our third date."
01:47:12;01:47:19;"I feel like, but see, in this better than Ezra song, if he's just gotten dumped or whatever,"
01:47:19;01:47:22;"and he's, you know, alone, the vocals be chiller."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"Yeah, it doesn't work."
01:47:23;01:47:26;"He's like, it was good living with you."
01:47:26;01:47:31;"It should be like, you know, more of a Cobain thing, like something in the way, like, it"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"was good."
01:47:32;01:47:36;"Like, just kind of like mumbly, like get the hairs in your eyes."
01:47:36;01:47:39;"You can, you know, it's just like you're bummed out."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"Oppressed."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Yeah."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"It's not like, it was good living with you."
01:47:43;01:47:47;"It begs the question, when is it okay to be on chill?"
01:47:47;01:47:50;"When is it okay to sing in an unchill manner?"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"It's a deep question."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Well, who are like unchill singers?"
01:47:54;01:47:55;"Musicals."
01:47:55;01:47:59;"Well, I was thinking even like Freddie Mercury is a pretty unchill singer."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Yeah."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"But that's, that's musical adjacent."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Yeah, I see what you're saying."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"There's something theatrical about that."
01:48:05;01:48:08;"In the 90s, you had to be chill."
01:48:08;01:48:13;"That's really the, I mean, yeah, that era was the, the disaffected ironic era."
01:48:13;01:48:14;"You had to be chill."
01:48:14;01:48:17;"Yeah, but by the way, it's not like you could do that now."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"Can't be unchill now."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"You know who was kind of unchill in the 90s?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"It was Meat Loaf, I feel."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"But that's also musical adjacent."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"Again, theatrical."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"Yes."
01:48:27;01:48:31;"You know who wasn't chill was like, I don't know, like Soundgarden."
01:48:31;01:48:32;"Not chill."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"Green Day?"
01:48:33;01:48:34;"Pretty unchill."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Oh, that's true."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"But they have a musical."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"But they're like fired up."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"I know, but they had like a musical on Broadway."
01:48:42;01:48:47;"And the reason they could do that is 'cause everything they said was so intelligible."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"You know?"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Yeah, the enunciated clearly."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"I don't know."
01:48:53;01:48:57;"Anyway, Better Than Ezra, that did not sound good."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"I will not be."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"Not Better Than Ezra."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"I'm not gonna blow Matt's spot."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"He was texting me that he loves this song."
01:49:03;01:49:06;"And I'll also say I kind of was feeling it too."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Oh."
01:49:07;01:49:11;"I felt better, maybe against the Montel, I think, as Rashida said."
01:49:11;01:49:14;"I just sort of felt a little bit better about it."
01:49:14;01:49:18;"But yeah, I'm not trying to blow up your spot, Matt."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"But you should be a Better Than Ezra fan."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"But he's also a big emo."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Like, this is your pocket, right?"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"It's a catchy song."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"It's a totally catchy song."
01:49:28;01:49:33;"Here's a quote from Kevin Griffin, the songwriter and singer."
01:49:33;01:49:38;"""I wanted to talk about the positive things that come from the end of a relationship."""
01:49:38;01:49:39;"Oh."
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Okay, it's very--"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"I was trying to be--"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"It's not rock and roll."
01:49:42;01:49:47;"I don't want maturity and insight from a rock band of guys in their 20s."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"""There's always the hurt feelings, and everyone's guarded, and it can be traumatic."
01:49:51;01:49:54;"But when the dust settles, it was about looking at the good things,"""
01:49:54;01:49:59;"no pun intended, ""that you got from the relationship."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"How did you grow?"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"What did you learn emotionally?"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"And to experience some stuff, and in this case,"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"it was just kind of reflecting on how the person changed."""
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Wow."
01:50:09;01:50:12;"You know what I kind of always weirdly associate this song with?"
01:50:12;01:50:15;"I don't know why, but do you know Closing Time, Semi Sonic?"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Yes."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"It's kind of nasal, right?"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"And not different band, but I don't know."
01:50:21;01:50:25;"Again, that's the thing is like the--"
01:50:25;01:50:30;"it's like the best of the thing, which I would imagine at this point is like Green Day,"
01:50:30;01:50:35;"it trickles down into the less good version of the thing."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Oh, sure."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"Yeah."
01:50:37;01:50:41;"Let's move on to the last song, the number one song."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"This week, May '95."
01:50:50;01:50:55;"You're All I Need to Get By, another banger."
01:50:55;01:50:58;"With Method Man and Mary J. Blige."
01:51:08;01:51:13;"This was the height of the like featuring."
01:51:13;01:51:18;"Like every feature was like heavy hitter bringing heavy hitter, you know?"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"Like no weak spots."
01:51:20;01:51:23;"Like Method Man and Mary J. Blige?"
01:51:23;01:51:26;"Like who's featuring who?"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"You know?"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Yeah, was this a Method Man album?"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Was it on his album?"
01:51:31;01:51:36;"It was a Puff Daddy remix of a song that was on his solo album, yeah."
01:51:36;01:51:41;"Which was also weird because Puff Daddy working with the Wu-Tang Clan was like--"
01:51:41;01:51:45;"You weren't supposed to cross, yeah, at the time."
01:51:45;01:51:51;"I'm telling you, '95, everybody was hanging out in OK."
01:51:51;01:51:56;"You know, it wasn't like dance guys, like, you know, cool guys."
01:51:56;01:51:59;"Like everybody was at the club."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"Are you talking about the west coast, east coast beat?"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"Well, no, because Wu-Tang is east coast."
01:52:05;01:52:09;"But I'm saying like you think about like Puff Daddy, you think about Wu-Tang,"
01:52:09;01:52:14;"and they represent something so different in hip-hop, seemingly, you know?"
01:52:14;01:52:21;"Like one's a party vibe and the other's like, you know, martial arts, you know?"
01:52:21;01:52:24;"Hey, Jake, who's your favorite member of the Wu-Tang Clan?"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"RZA?"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"I mean, he's the queen."
01:52:27;01:52:30;"Yeah, he's the queen bee."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"I just pulled that out of my ass."
01:52:32;01:52:37;"No, RZA, he's an actor, multi-hyphenate producer."
01:52:37;01:52:40;"Rashida, do you have a favorite Wu-Tang?"
01:52:40;01:52:48;"Well, you know, many, many years ago, actually, probably the summer of this song,"
01:52:48;01:52:55;"the summer this song came out, my dad had a short-lived vibe talk show."
01:52:55;01:53:00;"And my sister and I somehow convinced my dad to let us be correspondents."
01:53:00;01:53:06;"And our first job was to go to Hawaii with the entire Wu-Tang Clan."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"What?"
01:53:07;01:53:10;"Which we barely made it out alive from."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"Like, literally, we had to change hotels four times."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"We did, like, water sports that nearly killed us."
01:53:15;01:53:19;"So I spent a lot of time, we did, like, sketches, like, together."
01:53:19;01:53:23;"Like, I feel like, Nick, you know Daniel Kellison."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"You must know Daniel Kellison, right?"
01:53:25;01:53:26;"He's, like, a producer."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"He works with Jimmy Kimmel."
01:53:27;01:53:32;"Anyway, he produced the show, and he, like, hired us writers, and we did, like, sketches."
01:53:32;01:53:37;"I did, like, a sketch with Ghostface, where we were, like, doing a commercial for Sunblock."
01:53:37;01:53:41;"Like, we were on jet skis with, you know, Dirty, like, ODB."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"Like, it was crazy."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"It was a crazy time."
01:53:43;01:53:50;"I'm going to say ODB, because he was a Jones RIP, and we were, we had a special connection."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"Is that available to see anywhere?"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"I feel like there's a little bit online."
01:53:54;01:53:59;"I have some, you know, I have some archival tapes, but there's, like, the segment that"
01:53:59;01:54:04;"aired online, or on the show is online, and then I have all the tapes."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"Wow."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"I know."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"Crazy."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Speechless."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"They were all there, too."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"And they were all so cool, by the way."
01:54:11;01:54:14;"Like, every single one of them was great."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"So, what, '95?"
01:54:15;01:54:16;"'95."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"Yeah, like, '95."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"Wow."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"So, they were, like, okay."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"Full force, full powers, like, Wu-Tang."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Yeah."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"It's amazing."
01:54:25;01:54:29;"So, when you say you had to change hotels four times, I mean, what were the extenuating"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"circumstances?"
01:54:30;01:54:36;"There was a lot of, there was a lot of police officers looking for certain members of the"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"group."
01:54:37;01:54:41;"I think it was mainly just, like, weed-related, you know?"
01:54:41;01:54:45;"Like, they were just, like, in trouble for s***, and just shenanigans."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Also, everybody was really young, you know?"
01:54:47;01:54:50;"I mean, they were all, like, 20s, early 20s."
01:54:50;01:54:56;"I mean, there was a lot going on with ODB around, I don't think it was, maybe it was"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"'95."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Do you remember, like, he couldn't perform?"
01:54:58;01:55:02;"There was, like, that famous show where he, like, he ran on stage because, like, he, for"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"weed or whatever."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"Yeah."
01:55:04;01:55:09;"But then he wasn't really, like, he, but he couldn't, he wasn't supposed to show up."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"And I think maybe then they were, the cops, like, came to the stage, but, like, he ran"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"out on stage."
01:55:13;01:55:18;"There's a couple, like, big, at least one that I know of, like, big show where, like,"
01:55:18;01:55:21;"ODB would, like, not, he's not supposed to be there, and then he would just, like, pop"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"up, and it'd be, like, very exciting, you know?"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Yeah."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"Because he's basically in hiding."
01:55:26;01:55:30;"He was, he was, he had, like, some, you know, Loch Ness Monster vibes where people were"
01:55:30;01:55:34;"not sure if he was ever going to show up or not, you know?"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Ruchira, thanks for joining."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Thanks for having me, guys."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Always happy to be here."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Always really fun to do the Generation X."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"I have one more question."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"Yeah."
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Was I better than Ezra?"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"Ooh."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"I'm going to say yes."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"Ruchira, you were, you were good."
01:55:50;01:55:53;"Oh."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"You were good."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Anybody else want to chime in?"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Anybody else want to?"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"I think you were better than Ezra."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"I think Ezra needs to watch his back."
01:56:03;01:56:08;"I think, you know, any time we give Jake, when Ezra leaves the show, we let Jake, we"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"see if he lands the plane."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"Yeah."
01:56:10;01:56:13;"I mean, to be honest, it's not really, was, is Ruchira better than Ezra?"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"It is also Jake, too."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"And I think maybe together."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"Is Jake better with me?"
01:56:19;01:56:23;"Yes, that's really, the question is, the question is, let's talk about the chemistry, guys."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"And I think, I think, I think it's fresh."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"We have Gen X, we have Gen X chemistry."
01:56:30;01:56:31;"That's true."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"That's, we know that."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"We already know that."
01:56:33;01:56:37;"I don't want to, I don't want to judge until we find out if Jake can land the plane tonight."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"Oh, yeah."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"I feel like that's going to be the determining factor, right?"
01:56:40;01:56:41;"I think he was just trying."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"I think he was just trying."
01:56:43;01:56:44;"I think I landed it."
01:56:44;01:56:47;"We just, now we're circling the airport."
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Wait, are we still recording?"
01:56:49;01:56:50;"Is this still the show?"
01:56:50;01:56:55;"The Montel George is playing under what we're talking about right now, and I just landed"
01:56:55;01:56:56;"the plane."
01:56:56;01:57:02;"Once again, thank you to Ruchira Jones for joining Time Crisis for the Generation X 1995"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"Rock vs. R&B Countdown."
01:57:05;01:57:07;"We will see you in July."
01:57:07;01:57:11;"Time Crisis is off for the month of June to celebrate the summer solstice."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Landed."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"That's it."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"Landed."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Bumpy, but he did it."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"But he did it."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"Hey, we're on the ground."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"This is how we do it."
01:57:26;01:57:30;"It's Friday night, and I feel all right."
01:57:30;01:57:35;"The party's here on the west side, so I reach for my 40 and I turn it up."
01:57:35;01:57:38;"Designated driver, take the keys to my truck."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"Hit the shaw 'cause I'm faded."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"Honey's in the streets, say money, oh, we made it."
01:57:42;01:57:47;"It feels so good in my hood tonight."
01:57:47;01:57:52;"The summertime skirts and the guys in kanai, all the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by."
01:57:52;01:57:56;"You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid."
01:57:56;01:58:00;"So tip up your cup and throw your hands up and let me hear the party say,"
01:58:00;01:58:05;"I'm kind of buzzed and it's all because this is how we do it."
01:58:05;01:58:08;"South Central does it like nobody does."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"This is how we do it."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"To all my neighbors, you got much flavor."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"This is how we do it."
01:58:14;01:58:17;"Let's flip the track with the old school bad."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"This is how we do it."
01:58:19;01:58:22;"This is how we do it."
01:58:22;01:58:26;"All hands are in the air and wave 'em from here to there."
01:58:26;01:58:31;"If you're an OG Mac or a wannabe player, you see the hood's been good to me."
01:58:31;01:58:35;"Ever since I was a lowercase g, but now I'm a big G."
01:58:35;01:58:38;"The girls say I got your money, hundred dollar bills, y'all."
01:58:38;01:58:42;"If you were from where I'm from, then you would know"
01:58:42;01:58:45;"that I gotta get mine in a big black truck."
01:58:45;01:58:48;"You can get yours in a six-four."
01:58:48;01:58:51;"Whatever it is, the party's underwear."
01:58:51;01:58:56;"So tip up your cup and throw your hands up and let me hear the party say,"
01:58:56;01:59:00;"I'm kind of buzzed and it's all because this is how we do it."
01:59:00;01:59:03;"South Central does it like nobody does."

01:59:22;01:59:24;"This is how we do it."
01:59:24;01:59:28;"YMV, SEC, this is how we do it."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"I'll never come back on an old school track."
01:59:31;01:59:33;"This is how we do it. Check it out."
01:59:33;01:59:38;"Once upon a time in '94, Montell made no money and life sure was slow."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"And all they said was 6'8"" he stood."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"And people thought the music that he made was good."
01:59:42;01:59:45;"They lived to DJ and Paul was his name."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"He came up to money, this is what he said."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"You and OG are going to make some cash."
01:59:49;01:59:52;"Sell a million records and we're making the dash."
01:59:52;01:59:56;"Oh, I'm buzzed and it's all because this is how we do it."
01:59:56;01:59:59;"South Central does it like nobody does."
01:59:59;02:00:01;"This is how we do it."
