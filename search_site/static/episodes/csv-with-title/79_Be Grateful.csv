00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. On this week's episode, we talk to the social media strategists"
00:08;00:18;"of Texas-based Buffalo Wang's restaurant, Pluckers. We also talk about A Star is Born"
00:18;00:26;"and its potential sequel, Zzzz. All this, plus the greatest hits of 1983 and today."
00:26;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts. One."
00:33;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful"
00:40;00:49;"chances. My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the blow, when"
00:49;01:12;"the bus had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us"
01:12;01:21;"is lying, leave an only way. Time Crisis, back again. So Jake, I still haven't seen"
01:21;01:30;"A Star is Born. Oh man! Clearly I gotta see it. Yeah. It's the music event of the year."
01:30;01:35;"And film. And film of the year. Why haven't you seen it? You been busy? Yeah, I've been"
01:35;01:39;"kinda busy. Yeah. It just never feels like the right night to like go to the movies."
01:39;01:43;"Interesting. I love going to the movies, so it's like if there's an excuse, I'm doing"
01:43;01:48;"it, we're doing it. I like it conceptually. We saw it opening weekend. Was the theater"
01:48;01:55;"packed? No. Really? Pasadena Arclight. Pretty full. Nice. I'm looking at the A Star is Born"
01:55;01:59;"merch. Some of it is kinda what you'd expect, 'cause for people who haven't seen the movie"
01:59;02:04;"like me, but really don't know anything about it, the two main characters are Allie, played"
02:04;02:09;"by Lady Gaga. I'm impressed that you know these character names. I've read so much about"
02:09;02:14;"it. I'm about as familiar with this movie as anybody could be without having seen it."
02:14;02:19;"Lady Gaga plays Allie, and Bradley Cooper plays Jackson Maine. The A Star is Born merch"
02:19;02:25;"is as if they were real people, so it's like a picture of Lady Gaga and it says like, ""Allie."""
02:25;02:29;"It's almost like you picked it up at an Allie concert. Right. And then there's some Jackson"
02:29;02:33;"Maine ones, but the one that's really hilarious to me is a picture of Bradley Cooper holding"
02:33;02:37;"a guitar and it says, ""One night only, Jackson Maine, Louisville, Kentucky with special guest"
02:37;02:42;"May 15th, 2009."" I'm like, ""Damn, that's a lot of detail."" Is that like a part of the"
02:42;02:47;"movie? Is there a special concert? I don't know. The 2009 is weird, 'cause it's sort"
02:47;02:52;"of like in the movie you are sort of wondering like, ""When is this taking place? Is this"
02:52;02:59;"2017, 2018?"" I guess this answers your question. It's 2009. Are there references to current"
02:59;03:04;"President Obama? No. I think it is set in the present day, but he's had a long career."
03:04;03:10;"Do people use cell phones in the film? Oh, yeah. The Nintendo Switch? Very heavy with"
03:10;03:14;"the Nintendo Switch. Okay, so then it's gotta be the past couple years. No, I think it is"
03:14;03:18;"the last few years, but yeah, he's had a long career and he's maybe on the backside of that"
03:18;03:25;"career. Maybe he was at his peak, first decade of the century. What happened to you, Jackson?"
03:25;03:29;"Sitting in your apartment all day playing Nintendo Switch? Used to be a big star. I"
03:29;03:33;"wish I could do the Jackson Mean voice. What is it? Is it Southern? It's real low. It's"
03:33;03:39;"just like a lot of fry. It's like, ""What am I been doing? I just been playing that Nintendo"
03:39;03:46;"Switch."" Better than Nintendo Wii. That was the main Nintendo platform a few years back."
03:46;03:51;"I'll tell you what. You know who his voice is kind of like? Yeah. It's Sam Elliott, 'cause"
03:51;03:55;"Sam Elliott is in the film. He plays his brother. Oh, wow. I didn't want to spoil that, 'cause"
03:55;03:59;"that's kind of a late reveal. Oh, is it? Well, midway through the film. I feel like every"
03:59;04:03;"article about this that I've seen references the brother, Sam Elliott. See, I hadn't read"
04:03;04:07;"that much about it, and I actually went in with low expectations, and I was- Blown away."
04:07;04:12;"Thrilled. Anyway- You know what it was? It reminded me of Titanic in a good way. It was"
04:12;04:20;"a sweeping, tragic romance epic. Whoa. I haven't heard anybody compare it to Titanic. That's"
04:20;04:24;"what I thought of when the credits started rolling. Usually when the credits start, the"
04:24;04:29;"crowd just kind of gets up immediately and dances out. In this situation, the crowd stayed"
04:29;04:35;"seated just to kind of soak up the last sort of ambience of the film. That's what popped"
04:35;04:40;"in, Titanic. It's like a different aesthetic than Titanic, but it's the same sort of emotional"
04:40;04:43;"register. I haven't seen the movie, but the main thing I just kept thinking about was"
04:43;04:48;"how hilarious it'd be to get you this shirt. Maybe Tom Cruise has got to get you this one."
04:48;04:52;"Did you rock this one? It's not just Jack- I couldn't rock it, dude. No, but I love that"
04:52;04:57;"it's so specific. Also, how did they decide this? Louisville, Kentucky with special guest"
04:57;05:03;"May 15th, 2009. Well, maybe he's from there? His character? Oh yeah, because there's a"
05:03;05:08;"scene when he's hanging out with Dave Chappelle, and I think that's back- Back in Louisville?"
05:08;05:13;"In like where he's from. Have you seen the film, Seinfeld? I saw it. Oh, really? Yeah."
05:13;05:19;"Lots? Yeah, I also had low expectations, and yeah, I enjoyed it. I don't think I enjoyed"
05:19;05:24;"it as much as you did, but I liked it. I just like this shirt because it's one step beyond."
05:24;05:28;"I guess there's like levels. You can get a shirt that's kind of like, ""I'm a fan of this"
05:28;05:32;"thing,"" and then you can get a shirt that's kind of like, ""I'm such a fan of this thing,"
05:32;05:38;"I want a shirt that kind of makes it seem like I live in the world of the movie."" Right."
05:38;05:42;"And this one is like, ""I'm so deep into the world of the movie that I'm actually exploring"
05:42;05:46;"like the outer reaches."" It's like fan fiction. I'm exploring the Jackson Maine universe,"
05:46;05:47;"the JMU."
05:47;06:00;"Maybe it's time to let the old ways die. Maybe it's time to let the old ways die. Takes a"
06:00;06:11;"lot to change a man. Hell, it takes a lot to try. Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."
06:11;06:24;"Nobody knows what a ways for the dead. Nobody knows what a ways for the dead. Some folks"
06:24;06:30;"just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read. Nobody knows what a"
06:30;06:32;"ways for the dead."
06:32;06:39;"Are there other examples of, from like realistic films of like fan fiction merch?"
06:39;06:42;"There's the Axe Capital Billions t-shirt."
06:42;06:43;"Nice."
06:43;06:44;"Comes to mind."
06:44;06:45;"Oh yeah, well exactly."
06:45;06:46;"But that's not like, they're not pushing it."
06:46;06:51;"It's like you could go to the NBC store at Rockefeller Center and you could get a shirt"
06:51;06:56;"of Michael Scott from The Office saying some like classic Michael Scott type line and just"
06:56;06:59;"wear that and people would be like, ""Oh, you like The Office?"" And then you could get a"
06:59;07:03;"shirt that says The Office. You get a shirt that says Dunder Mifflin."
07:03;07:04;"Okay."
07:04;07:05;"It's like a little inside."
07:05;07:10;"It's like semi plausibly realistic if that universe existed."
07:10;07:11;"Yeah, exactly."
07:11;07:13;"If The Office universe existed."
07:13;07:15;"They would have Dunder Mifflin t-shirts."
07:15;07:18;"You wouldn't have a t-shirt with Michael Scott on it."
07:18;07:22;"Exactly. As a fan of a fictional universe, the t-shirt you choose shows."
07:22;07:24;"That's to exist within that universe."
07:24;07:27;"It shows what reality you want to live in. There's people who are like, ""I enjoy The"
07:27;07:34;"Office. It's a funny program. I like to flip it on. Takes my cares away."" And there's other"
07:34;07:38;"people who are like, ""I live in The Office universe."""
07:38;07:41;"That's why Ghostbusters shirts always kind of worked."
07:41;07:43;"Because they're both at once."
07:43;07:48;"Yeah. It's the simple shirt with just the logo, but in the film, the Ghostbusters become"
07:48;07:54;"celebrities and are like a hot thing in New York for a second. And people are rocking"
07:54;07:58;"in the fictional universe of the film. People are wearing shirts with the Ghostbusters logo."
07:58;07:59;"Right."
08:00;08:04;"When you wear that, it's like you might've been a fan in the fictional universe of the"
08:04;08:11;"film. But a lot of movies, what could you do? Like in Lebowski, there probably is fictional"
08:11;08:12;"merch you could wear."
08:12;08:19;"Yeah. You get a Harry Potter shirt that says, ""Property of Gryffindor,"" as if you bought"
08:19;08:23;"it at the Gryffindor gift shop. Like it's a real place."
08:23;08:26;"Yeah. I don't know about this Jackson Maine tee."
08:26;08:29;"Anyway, we're going to get it for you. Where are you going to wear it to?"
08:29;08:34;"I wouldn't wear it. I'll be honest with you. I love free t-shirts."
08:34;08:39;"The Time Crisis crew drops $35 plus shipping and handling on this t-shirt. We get it for"
08:39;08:44;"you. It's a high quality shirt. Nice cotton. Feels good. Fits great."
08:44;08:45;"Very soft."
08:45;08:47;"Very soft. You're not going to wear it?"
08:47;08:50;"I would wear it to a taping of the show."
08:50;08:51;"That's it?"
08:51;08:52;"Yeah."
08:52;08:53;"You're wearing a Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar sweatshirt right now."
08:53;08:58;"I know. I have so much merch. Actually, I was saying this the other day. My wardrobe"
08:58;09:06;"right now is like, it's either like Time Crisis or Vampire Weekend or Little Wings or Richard"
09:06;09:07;"Pictures based."
09:07;09:08;"Or Sweet Martha's."
09:08;09:10;"Or Sweet Martha's. That's kind of like TC Universe."
09:10;09:11;"Yeah. True."
09:11;09:18;"Because I have three Sweet Martha's shirts. I have 8 Minute Cape Cod. That's a classic."
09:18;09:22;"I have my, I've been wearing my Father's Day Weekend, Vampire Weekend."
09:22;09:24;"Oh yeah. I've seen you wear that out in the wild."
09:24;09:25;"A lot."
09:25;09:26;"That looks great."
09:26;09:30;"It's kind of cooling down a little bit in LA. And I've got countless Little Wings and"
09:30;09:31;"Richard Pictures shirts."
09:31;09:35;"And all those shirts, you never think twice about throwing on?"
09:35;09:39;"No. They're cool, man. But like, just like walking into like,"
09:39;09:40;"I agree. I agree."
09:40;09:43;"They're like civil coffee down the street from me. I'm just like wearing like a Jackson"
09:43;09:48;"Maine tee. I mean, that does show that I do, I do."
09:48;09:49;"That's sick."
09:49;09:53;"I would describe myself as a guy that's super, you know, self-conscious about my appearance"
09:53;09:54;"in public."
09:54;09:55;"But you would be that self-conscious."
09:55;09:57;"That would, that's pushing it."
09:57;09:59;"Would you wear an Ally shirt?"
09:59;10:00;"No, man."
10:00;10:04;"Would you wear a shirt that says Bradley Cooper and it's a picture of Bradley Cooper directing"
10:04;10:05;"Stars Born?"
10:05;10:06;"Like, just-"
10:06;10:08;"Is that sure that you're more in touch with consensus reality?"
10:08;10:11;"I like that. I like that interpretation."
10:11;10:15;"Let's get one that's just like, picture Bradley Cooper says Bradley Cooper on the back. It"
10:15;10:16;"says director of Stars Born."
10:16;10:17;"That'd be solid."
10:17;10:18;"You'd rock that?"
10:18;10:21;"And it's him like in an editing booth or something."
10:21;10:24;"Or no, if it was, yeah, that's fine."
10:24;10:27;"Or maybe that's the back of the shirt and then the front of the shirt is, is him as"
10:27;10:28;"Jackson Maine."
10:28;10:29;"You know what would be really dope?"
10:29;10:34;"Like take it deep, like find a picture of like a young Bradley Cooper from like when"
10:34;10:39;"he was like 18 and like the mid nineties and then just like have like, make a shirt from"
10:39;10:45;"like Jackson Maine live at the Troubadour, July 22nd, 1996."
10:45;10:47;"Like really go deep."
10:47;10:52;"And it's like a very young Bradley Cooper, like, you know, like in the role of a very"
10:52;10:53;"young Jackson Maine."
10:53;10:54;"Opening-"
10:54;10:56;"Because he's had a 25 year career."
10:56;10:57;"Yeah."
10:57;10:58;"Opening-"
10:58;11:02;"Opening for Eddie Vedder, for Eddie Vedder solo ukulele show at the Troubadour, 1998."
11:02;11:10;"Oh no, that's even deeper. You make an Eddie Vedder t-shirt solo to her and then very small"
11:10;11:14;"text at the bottom is just with special guest Jackson Maine."
11:14;11:19;"You notice you make it Austin city limits, 2005 festival shirt, just with like whatever"
11:19;11:20;"it is on the front."
11:20;11:24;"And then in the back, just very subtly you change it to Jackson Maine."
11:24;11:29;"Like, like 35th listed performer."
11:29;11:35;"You know, it's all just spot on realistic taking the Jackson Maine, just a granular level"
11:35;11:36;"of detail."
11:36;11:37;"Okay."
11:37;11:38;"What about this is probably the coolest Jackson Maine shirt."
11:38;11:41;"This one, the one I'm showing Jake now, it kind of looks like an actual vintage, like"
11:41;11:43;"Bob Seger shirt from the seventies."
11:43;11:45;"Would you rock this one?"
11:45;11:46;"Oh man."
11:46;11:50;"I mean, you love the film."
11:50;11:55;"It's the best looking shirt of the ones we've seen, but you know, what's funny, I couldn't"
11:55;11:59;"rock it because, well, it's still from the film, but also because of the time period"
11:59;12:05;"in which the film is set, it automatically becomes, this is like a reissue, a fake retro"
12:05;12:08;"shirt that you'd see at like target."
12:08;12:09;"You didn't buy this."
12:09;12:11;"Jackson Maine wasn't touring in 1980."
12:11;12:18;"You know, there's a whole like other uncanny valley."
12:18;12:42;"I mean, I don't know."
12:42;13:01;"Do you think that they're going to continue making albums as Jackson Maine?"
13:01;13:03;"Like is this to keep going?"
13:03;13:07;"I think Bradley Cooper is to, uh, he would find that corny."
13:07;13:08;"That's my guess."
13:08;13:10;"And he's right to find that corny."
13:10;13:12;"Keep expanding the stars born universe."
13:12;13:18;"I could totally picture like somebody right now putting together a deal."
13:18;13:22;"Bradley Cooper, lady Gaga tour tour."
13:22;13:23;"Oh yeah."
13:23;13:26;"Arena tour as Jackson Maine and Allie."
13:26;13:27;"Wow."
13:27;13:28;"Would people go?"
13:28;13:29;"I mean, Gaga's huge."
13:29;13:32;"So Gaga's got a built in thing and they'd have to do it soon."
13:32;13:38;"Who are some other fictional musicians that could get in Jeff Bridges from crazy heart?"
13:38;13:39;"Real mellow."
13:39;13:43;"Jackson Maine alley with special guests, Jeff Bridges from crazy heart, Mark Wahlberg"
13:43;13:48;"from rock star."
13:48;13:50;"What other fictional musicians?"
13:50;13:51;"That's a good one."
13:51;13:52;"Blues brothers."
13:52;13:53;"That's a good one."
13:53;13:54;"What?"
13:54;13:55;"John Goodman."
13:55;13:56;"Yeah."
13:56;13:58;"And Dan Aykroyd, the John Goodman reboot."
13:58;14:06;"Jackson Maine with miles Teller from whiplash on drums."
14:06;14:10;"Whiplash long sleeve, awkward movie merch."
14:10;14:11;"I love it."
14:11;14:12;"Oh, you know what?"
14:12;14:14;"I wear long, dumb road shirts."
14:14;14:15;"Oh, there you go."
14:15;14:17;"Coming out next month, folks."
14:17;14:18;"Oh wow."
14:18;14:19;"Real soon."
14:19;14:20;"Yeah."
14:20;14:21;"Looking forward to that."
14:21;14:22;"Oh yeah."
14:22;14:23;"Trying to think of movie shirts."
14:23;14:26;"I mean, I just remember like in the nineties when I was very interested in T shirts and"
14:26;14:31;"I was like 12, 13, there were just like very interested in T shirt."
14:31;14:37;"And it was like a joke in my family that my main passions as a young adult, I don't remember"
14:37;14:41;"exactly the order, but at some point I was really into comic books, specifically X-Men"
14:41;14:42;"comic books."
14:42;14:45;"I've probably talked about this on the show."
14:45;14:49;"And then at some point before I got just like deeply into music and I was liked music, but"
14:49;14:55;"before I was like, you know, would spend my allowance on CDs."
14:55;14:59;"There was some point in between where my thing was like T shirts, just like a T shirt guy."
14:59;15:01;"And now I kind of am again."
15:01;15:02;"Yeah."
15:02;15:03;"It seems like that never went away."
15:03;15:06;"I mean, there was a period, you know, like early vampire weekend days, my whole thing"
15:06;15:08;"was like, I'm not into T shirts."
15:08;15:09;"Oh, polos."
15:09;15:10;"I'm into collared shirts and polos."
15:10;15:14;"What were your big, like coveted T shirts when you were a kid?"
15:14;15:18;"It was at that point, it was also kind of like very early internet days."
15:18;15:21;"So you would still get mail order catalogs."
15:21;15:24;"So it could be like really exciting to just like see all the options."
15:24;15:26;"So actually I was into music shirts."
15:26;15:30;"One prize position I had, which I'm pretty sure I don't have, cause I was looking for"
15:30;15:34;"one says, uh, the Southern California and Scott punk band voodoo glow skulls."
15:34;15:37;"I'd like a sick voodoo glow skull shirt."
15:37;15:38;"I had a lot of Scott t-shirts."
15:38;15:39;"Were you a fan of the band?"
15:39;15:40;"Yeah."
15:40;15:41;"I love voodoo glow skulls."
15:41;15:43;"And they had like specifically sick merch."
15:43;15:44;"Yeah."
15:44;15:45;"They had cool merch."
15:45;15:47;"It was like skeletons being the horn section."
15:47;15:48;"Yes."
15:48;15:49;"I had some music shirts."
15:49;15:55;"I had a, uh, Ultraman, Japanese superhero ringer T. Remember ringer T's were very hot"
15:55;15:56;"in the nineties."
15:56;15:57;"Oh, with the cuffs."
15:57;15:58;"Yeah."
16:00;16:01;"I never could wear those."
16:01;16:02;"Really?"
16:02;16:03;"I just felt too goofy."
16:03;16:04;"It's like too hip or something."
16:04;16:06;"I just never could rock that."
16:06;16:07;"I could see that."
16:07;16:08;"Yeah."
16:08;16:12;"If I was like college age, when I was like 12, yeah, it was kind of like a seventies"
16:12;16:13;"throwback."
16:13;16:14;"Right."
16:14;16:15;"Yeah."
16:15;16:19;"Another one I had, which is like classic nineties, ironic style was a Mr. Bubbles shirt."
16:19;16:23;"You know, just kind of like a funny, goofy old brand."
16:23;16:24;"Dude."
16:24;16:26;"I had a Mento shirt in high school."
16:26;16:31;"We, um, me and some buddies, we like saved up all of the Mentos wrappers."
16:31;16:34;"If you sent in like 10 or 15, they sent you a shirt."
16:34;16:35;"Oh really?"
16:35;16:36;"And it was like a prize possession for us."
16:36;16:38;"See, what'd you share it with, with the crew?"
16:38;16:40;"No, we, no, we each like sent in the rappers."
16:40;16:44;"So we had like three, it was like in my band, Vince, Vince, chlorotho."
16:44;16:48;"And this is all coming back to me now."
16:48;16:49;"I don't think I've ever heard about that band."
16:49;16:50;"Yeah."
16:50;16:52;"And the three of us would all wear Mento shirts."
16:52;16:54;"What was the band called?"
16:54;16:55;"Vince, Vince, chlorotho."
16:55;16:56;"What does that mean?"
16:56;16:57;"It's up there."
16:57;16:58;"The worst name ever."
16:58;16:59;"VVC."
16:59;17:00;"VVC is too bad."
17:00;17:01;"It was called VVC."
17:01;17:02;"Why are we Vince, Vince, chlorotho?"
17:02;17:03;"How have we, we've heard about Cartesian divers, your band with Dave."
17:03;17:04;"Well, no, I wasn't in Cartesian divers."
17:04;17:05;"I was an American people."
17:05;17:06;"Okay."
17:06;17:07;"So what's the story of Vince, Vince?"
17:07;17:08;"Dave's eighth grade band was called Cartesian divers."
17:08;17:09;"You were not, you're just a fan?"
17:09;17:10;"No."
17:10;17:11;"And then Dave and I had a band called American people."
17:11;17:12;"And Dave and I were in the same band."
17:15;17:30;"And Dave had solo projects called Amsterdam and flames, angry youth."
17:30;17:34;"What were some of the other ones?"
17:34;17:35;"Dirty projectors."
17:35;17:36;"Oh yeah."
17:36;17:37;"Eventually dirty projectors."
17:37;17:41;"I was in a band called Vince, Vince, chlorotho with my two friends."
17:41;17:48;"And it's sadly enough, it's pertinent to this conversation, a Ghostbusters reference."
17:48;17:52;"When Rick Moranis' character, Louis Tully, the accountant that lives in central park"
17:52;17:59;"west gets possessed by the devil dog, he turns into Vince chlorotho."
17:59;18:00;"An iconic part of the film."
18:00;18:03;"He goes, I'm Vince, Vince chlorotho, key master of gulzer."
18:03;18:06;"You know, just like Lord of the Sibelii."
18:06;18:08;"Are you the gatekeeper?"
18:08;18:09;"That sounds familiar."
18:09;18:13;"Because you guys are so into quoting Ghostbusters, the fact that he said, I'm Vince, Vince chlorotho."
18:13;18:16;"Yeah, cause we were like a bunch of 17 year old dweebs."
18:16;18:19;"And like our band's called Vince, Vince chlorotho."
18:19;18:23;"And it was sort of like a Weezer meets pavement kind of ripoff band."
18:23;18:24;"And you wore Mentos shirts."
18:24;18:25;"Yeah."
18:25;18:27;"The girls loved our band."
18:27;18:28;"Really?"
18:28;18:29;"No."
18:29;18:30;"No, yeah."
18:30;18:31;"I've got a dungeon master's guide."
18:31;18:32;"I've got a 12 sided die."
19:02;19:05;"I've got it freely."
19:05;19:09;"I got Peter Criss waiting there for me."
19:09;19:11;"Yes I do."
19:11;19:13;"I do."
19:13;19:20;"In the garage I feel safe."
19:20;19:25;"No one cares about my ways."
19:25;19:30;"In the garage where I belong."
19:30;19:35;"No one hears me sing this song."
19:35;19:40;"In the garage."
19:40;19:44;"You know it kind of makes me think that every generation has like a bunch of kind of like"
19:44;19:49;"dumb brands that you kind of like but you also kind of like ironically are into."
19:49;19:52;"Like in the 90s Mentos because the commercials were kind of weird."
19:52;19:56;"It was like funny to be in a Mentos but Mentos are a decent product."
19:56;19:58;"I don't know like what five years ago."
19:58;20:01;"It was kind of like cool and funny to be into Chipotle."
20:01;20:02;"Is that fair to say."
20:02;20:03;"I don't know."
20:03;20:07;"Canada doesn't really have that many Chipotle so I don't know if we have that culture."
20:07;20:09;"I guess it was like an ironic thing."
20:09;20:11;"I'm not tapped in on that."
20:11;20:16;"It wasn't just that people were like like Chipotle is that people wouldn't shut up about Chipotle."
20:16;20:17;"It was like the Olive Garden right."
20:17;20:19;"Like the way people joke about the Olive Garden."
20:19;20:21;"Oh I see that kind of humor."
20:21;20:25;"But the Olive Garden I feel like people are just actually being mean and being like the Olive Garden sucks."
20:25;20:26;"Right."
20:26;20:31;"And Chipotle it's almost like I don't know why it's like there's certain things maybe just because they're new."
20:31;20:35;"People are like can't shut up about they're like exciting and funny to talk about."
20:35;20:37;"What is Chipotle's Twitter account like."
20:37;20:38;"It's a good question."
20:38;20:40;"Sounds like I get a number crunch on that."
20:40;20:41;"Let's take a look."
20:41;20:45;"They got eight hundred and eighty nine thousand followers."
20:45;20:46;"Damn."
20:46;20:49;"Their most recent tweet was is a taco a sandwich."
20:49;20:51;"Hundred and twenty two retweets."
20:51;20:59;"The previous tweet before that is that heroic feeling when one of your chips break off in the salsa and you send in another chip to rescue it."
20:59;21:01;"It's kind of like Wendy's two years ago."
21:01;21:02;"That's cute."
21:02;21:03;"Like on the cusp of like."
21:03;21:06;"It actually sounds pretty quaint by today's standards."
21:06;21:08;"None of that Steakums bulls**t."
21:08;21:09;"Oh getting political."
21:09;21:14;"The only thing hotter than our burritos is a registered voter from October 9th."
21:14;21:16;"I don't know if I'd call that political."
21:16;21:19;"Well they're not picking a side."
21:19;21:21;"Well it's engaged civically."
21:21;21:22;"Yeah it's civic."
21:22;21:24;"Yeah they're civically engaged."
21:24;21:26;"I'll take it at this point."
21:26;21:28;"Any other good tweets from Chipotle?"
21:28;21:31;"Is there a mood ring that can turn the color of a burrito?"
21:31;21:34;"What like an off white tortilla color?"
21:34;21:36;"That's just stupid."
21:36;21:38;"Hundred and fifty one retweets."
21:38;21:39;"That's just stupid man."
21:39;21:45;"But also I guess this is like classic that you know we're all just so basic."
21:45;21:46;"It's like some new s**t comes out."
21:46;21:48;"We just want to talk about the new s**t."
21:48;21:50;"And it's not necessarily because the new s**t is so interesting."
21:50;21:51;"It's just because it's new."
21:51;21:55;"It's like hey when you listen to like Cole Porter, Gershwin songs,"
21:55;21:58;"you know like popular music from the 20s, 30s, 40s, whatever."
21:58;22:02;"There's always like ""You send my heart like a rocket ship."""
22:02;22:04;"And it's like some s**t we don't even think twice about or it's like"
22:04;22:06;"Right but that would have been new."
22:06;22:08;"""You're the greatest thing since laundromats."""
22:08;22:11;"You know they're like they're just talking about whatever was new back then."
22:11;22:13;"""My Frigidaire."""
22:13;22:14;"Yeah exactly."
22:14;22:17;"I think if we went back and like poured over the lyrics like that kind of classic"
22:17;22:21;"Tin Pan Alley type stuff there'd be a lot of references to like electricity"
22:21;22:24;"and rocket ships and automobiles and s**t."
22:24;22:27;"And at the time that was kind of like you know writing a song today"
22:27;22:30;"where you talk about you know it goes down in the DMs."
22:30;22:31;"Right."
22:31;22:32;"Like it's not that interesting that it goes down in the DMs"
22:32;22:36;"but somebody's got to say it and then we're all like yeah it does go down in the DMs."
22:36;22:37;"That's some new s**t."
22:37;22:41;"And then in five years people are like DMs whatever that's how people talk."
22:41;22:42;"Who cares?"
22:42;22:43;"Yeah no s**t Chipotle it's just another chain."
22:43;22:47;"Do you guys know the comedian Sebastian Montescalo?"
22:47;22:48;"No."
22:48;22:51;"One time I went to a comedy club with somebody"
22:51;22:53;"and we were just kind of like watching whoever's up."
22:53;22:56;"And you know like especially in L.A. you'll get a mix."
22:56;22:59;"Any night you'll get a mix of like randos."
22:59;23:01;"I mean I've seen some like crazy s**t."
23:01;23:02;"And some heavy hitters."
23:02;23:04;"Oh I'm sorry it's Sebastian Montescalo."
23:04;23:08;"I've been to some nights where you just see like somebody"
23:08;23:11;"basically an amateur just like brutal."
23:11;23:15;"And then they're just like getting no laughs and they're like oh okay well you know"
23:15;23:18;"kind of cutting it early and then the guy gets up and he's like"
23:18;23:21;"next man needs no introduction Dave Chappelle."
23:21;23:23;"It's just like you know it's like that kind of vibe and you're just like"
23:23;23:26;"oh god I feel bad for that other person."
23:26;23:28;"But whatever maybe that's how you learn."
23:28;23:31;"So anyway this night at this comedy club it was like in a small room"
23:31;23:33;"and I don't know who's who."
23:33;23:37;"Of course I know the really big names but so this guy Sebastian Montescalo is on stage"
23:37;23:42;"and I'm listening to this guy and he's like pretty down the middle observational humor."
23:42;23:43;"But like a talented comedian."
23:43;23:47;"I'm not trying to knock him but the guy I was with is kind of like"
23:47;23:49;"this is one of the most successful comedians in America."
23:49;23:51;"And I was like are you kidding I've never heard of this guy."
23:51;23:52;"And they're like yeah that's his thing."
23:52;23:56;"He's not like one of these like I guess he is very famous but"
23:56;24:00;"he's not like one of these New York LA like super hip relevant comedians."
24:00;24:03;"He's a guy who has an act you can bring the whole family to."
24:03;24:04;"Observational."
24:04;24:05;"Simple."
24:05;24:07;"He's never I guess had a TV show or anything like that."
24:07;24:11;"And he just diligently tours and probably makes millions and millions of dollars a year."
24:11;24:13;"And he's just like you know does his thing."
24:13;24:14;"Like Brian Regan."
24:14;24:17;"Yeah I'm not sure who that is but that kind of vibe."
24:17;24:18;"I think yeah similar vibe."
24:18;24:21;"After that I was interested in him so I started looking up his bits"
24:21;24:27;"and I see like on YouTube he has certain bits that are have millions and millions of views."
24:27;24:28;"And I'm like okay."
24:28;24:31;"And then I kind of realized like oh this is what this guy does."
24:31;24:33;"It's not that different than say Jerry Seinfeld."
24:33;24:35;"Where he's observational humor."
24:35;24:38;"So but with him he's funny so he'll like just kind of pick on a topic."
24:38;24:44;"Just like pick these like big topics that other comedians maybe would find too basic or something."
24:44;24:46;"But he just like picks one and digs in."
24:46;24:49;"And one of the most viewed ones is about Chipotle."
24:49;24:51;"Oh God I want to watch this now."
24:51;24:54;"I actually don't know if in the comedy circle me saying that I find this guy funny"
24:54;24:56;"is like the equivalent of just like."
24:56;24:57;"Some eye rolls."
24:58;24:59;"But look."
24:59;25:01;"Like a friend is just like dude you know what man Matchbox 20."
25:01;25:02;"People slept on them."
25:02;25:03;"It might be like that."
25:03;25:04;"Nickelback or something."
25:04;25:05;"But he is good."
25:05;25:09;"His thing is that he's Italian American so he talks a lot about being Italian."
25:09;25:12;"And he really like plays into it with his accent."
25:12;25:14;"I think maybe he's from Chicago."
25:14;25:16;"So he does this whole bit about Chipotle."
25:16;25:18;"And this is just already the kind of dumb s*** I find funny."
25:18;25:21;"The whole time he just always refers to it as Chipote."
25:21;25:23;"It's like six minutes."
25:23;25:26;"Just like everybody's going to Chipote now."
25:26;25:28;"Everybody's talking about Chipote."
25:28;25:29;"That kind of just like stretching it out."
25:29;25:30;"Making such a meal of it."
25:30;25:33;"And this, you know, one way of looking at this would be like it's basic."
25:33;25:35;"Another way of looking at it would be like that's just a good comedian."
25:35;25:40;"Is that then he just describes what it's like to go to Chipote in detail."
25:40;25:41;"And he's just funny."
25:41;25:42;"So he just makes it funny."
25:42;25:46;"Like I bet if you look back and you compared it to like the best of the best."
25:46;25:47;"Like Chris Roger of Chappelle."
25:47;25:50;"You'd be like no joke of his hit the same high points as him."
25:50;25:55;"But then another part of my brain is like I just listen to this guy talk about Chipote for six minutes."
25:55;26:00;"Like he's like and then you go to Chipote and they say what do you want?"
26:00;26:01;"I don't know."
26:01;26:02;"I've never been to Chipote."
26:02;26:04;"It's like the jokes are like that."
26:04;26:05;"And then you always got the guy in front of you."
26:05;26:09;"He's reaching his arm over saying I want the pinto beans."
26:09;26:10;"He's reaching his arm over."
26:10;26:12;"Over the glass."
26:12;26:14;"The glass is supposed to protect you."
26:14;26:16;"You look at the guy and you're like you know don't do that."
26:16;26:18;"Don't reach your arm over the glass."
26:18;26:20;"Just say you want your pinto beans."
26:20;26:22;"And move over."
26:22;26:25;"This is Chipote."
26:25;26:27;"But it's like I'm actually pretty down with it."
26:27;26:29;"And then just like going through."
26:29;26:30;"Then you move over."
26:30;26:32;"Just describing it so slowly."
26:32;26:33;"In detail."
26:33;26:34;"But he's funny."
26:34;26:38;"So and I'm kind of like picturing like you know what I'll take my family to see this dude."
26:38;26:39;"This dude's funny as f**k."
26:39;26:41;"I just appreciate that."
26:41;26:43;"And then he's like and then you move over to the next guy."
26:43;26:45;"And it's like who's this guy?"
26:45;26:47;"Now I got to give you a whole new order?"
26:47;26:49;"Who's this guy?"
26:49;26:51;"Now this guy want to know what kind of meat I want?"
26:51;26:54;"One minute I'm talking about beans and rice."
26:54;26:57;"The next minute we're talking about meat."
26:57;26:59;"Couldn't the same."
26:59;27:00;"It's like that's the vibe."
27:00;27:02;"And I remember it's like then you get to the next guy."
27:02;27:03;"And then you got this guy."
27:03;27:06;"The guy who's in charge of wrapping the burrito."
27:06;27:10;"He gets this big plate."
27:10;27:15;"This thing is piled to the ceiling with beans and rice and cheese and chicken."
27:15;27:19;"And this guy's looking at this like oh boy I'm going to have to wrap this into a burrito."
27:19;27:21;"And this guy's wrapping the burrito."
27:21;27:23;"It's just like."
27:23;27:25;"I haven't watched it in like a year."
27:25;27:28;"But it clearly made a big impression on me."
27:28;27:32;"But anyway I guess that's why Chipotle was so bemusing to people."
27:32;27:36;"It's just because the ordering process was slightly different."
27:36;27:38;"And I'm not dissing him."
27:38;27:44;"I think he accurately picked up on the fact that America was bemused by Chipotle."
27:44;27:46;"Because you couldn't even do that."
27:46;27:49;"You see when McDonald's first came out in the '60s you could have done a whole bit."
27:49;27:51;"I bet there's."
27:51;27:53;"So I pull up to the drive-in."
27:53;27:55;"There's no drive-in anymore."
27:55;27:56;"You walk in."
27:56;27:58;"They say park your car and walk in."
27:58;27:59;"I'm like well you can't come out."
27:59;28:01;"Where's the girl in the roller skates?"
28:01;28:03;"Well you tell me I got to get at them."
28:03;28:05;"Now I'm standing in line?"
28:05;28:06;"Now I'm standing in line waiting."
28:06;28:08;"I look over the counter."
28:08;28:09;"The burgers are already made."
28:09;28:11;"I didn't even order one yet."
28:11;28:12;"And the burgers are already made."
28:12;28:14;"How long has this thing been sitting out?"
28:14;28:15;"And I eat it."
28:15;28:18;"It tastes pretty fresh."
28:18;28:20;"I like that type of humor."
28:20;28:23;"You can't get any customer service with the cable."
28:23;28:26;"Here I went to Chipotle a couple weeks ago."
28:26;28:27;"Love Chipotle."
28:27;28:30;"They make a really nice burrito over there."
28:30;28:35;"It's so terrific that the employees can't stop eating it."
28:35;28:37;"The employees are never working."
28:37;28:40;"They're always in the dining room eating."
28:40;28:43;"You ever walk in there and you're like where are the workers?"
28:43;28:56;"The only guy behind there is the guy cutting chicken just looking at you."
28:56;28:57;"Right?"
28:57;29:04;"He's not trained on burrito building."
29:04;29:06;"And I'm watching the people order."
29:06;29:08;"I mean there's a sneeze glass there right?"
29:08;29:12;"But people always hook the arm over the glass."
29:12;29:13;"I'll have corn."
29:13;29:15;"I'll have more corn."
29:15;29:19;"Just say corn."
29:19;29:20;"It's not soundproof."
29:20;29:23;"It goes right over the glass."
29:23;29:26;"Get your claw out of the cell."
29:26;29:28;"Chipotle."
29:28;29:35;"Anyway, speaking of social media, you know we talk so much about brand social media on time crisis."
29:35;29:37;"We've been going hard on that stuff."
29:37;29:38;"We've been going hard."
29:38;29:41;"But maybe we're talking about something that we don't even understand."
29:41;29:44;"We're talking about the people behind these accounts."
29:44;29:45;"And we don't even know these people."
29:45;29:47;"We're making assumptions about them."
29:47;29:50;"Which upstate New York liberal arts school they went to."
29:50;29:52;"How they're employed."
29:52;29:54;"What they're trying to do."
29:54;29:55;"What they're trying to accomplish."
29:55;29:57;"We don't know."
29:57;29:58;"Now the guy's looking at the Wendy's tweet."
29:58;30:00;"He's all upset."
30:00;30:02;"Wendy's isn't a person."
30:02;30:03;"Close the computer."
30:03;30:04;"Walk away."
30:04;30:05;"Who cares?"
30:05;30:06;"You want a Wendy's sandwich?"
30:06;30:07;"Go eat a Wendy's sandwich."
30:07;30:08;"You don't want a Wendy's sandwich?"
30:08;30:09;"Shut up."
30:09;30:13;"Why are you so upset about the social media presence of brands?"
30:13;30:15;"Steakums is depressed."
30:15;30:16;"Who cares?"
30:16;30:18;"Shut up."
30:18;30:20;"This is like the anti-Punisher burgers."
30:20;30:22;"Punisher burgers getting all bent out of shape."
30:22;30:24;"It's Twitter."
30:24;30:25;"It's hamburgers."
30:25;30:26;"Close the computer."
30:26;30:27;"Go outside."
30:27;30:28;"Get some fresh air."
30:28;30:29;"Shut up."
30:29;30:34;"Anyway, Seinfeld, you happened to meet a social media strategist."
30:34;30:39;"Yeah, this actually came through an email to 8minutecapecod."
30:39;30:40;"That's the numeral 8."
30:40;30:43;"At gmail.com from a long-time listener of the show."
30:43;30:45;"And he said, ""Hey, you guys are on this beat."
30:45;30:52;"I know somebody, my friend Mac, works for this chain, this Texas-based wing chain called Pluckers."""
30:52;30:58;"And it's kind of affiliated with that world of that sort of, you know, what we've been talking about."
30:58;30:59;"That sort of--"
30:59;31:01;"Right, because I've been interacting with Pluckers a little bit."
31:01;31:03;"I'd never heard of it, actually, before."
31:03;31:07;"Pluckers has 46,000 followers on Twitter."
31:07;31:09;"I saw they tweeted at you today."
31:09;31:11;"I'm looking at Pluckers' account."
31:11;31:15;"There's a lot of jokes about buffalo wings."
31:15;31:18;"They made a GIF that says ""Pluck me up, fam."""
31:18;31:21;"They told me to pluck off, things like that."
31:21;31:24;"So, anyway, we're going to talk to the man behind this account."
31:24;31:26;"We're going to talk to Mac."
31:26;31:30;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
31:31;31:33;"[phone ringing]"
31:33;31:34;"Hello?"
31:34;31:35;"Hey, is this Mac?"
31:35;31:36;"Yes, sir."
31:36;31:38;"Hey, what's up? You're on Time Crisis with Ezra and Jake."
31:38;31:39;"Yeah, how are you doing?"
31:39;31:40;"Not bad, man."
31:40;31:46;"Is it true that you're the social media strategist for Austin, Texas-based restaurant chain Pluckers Wing Bar?"
31:46;31:49;"I am. It is Pluckers Wing Bar down in Austin."
31:49;31:50;"Very cool."
31:50;31:51;"How many locations of Pluckers?"
31:51;31:53;"We currently have 23."
31:53;32:00;"We've got 24 opening by the spring, and then we'll have at least 25 by the end of next year."
32:00;32:01;"And they're all in Texas?"
32:01;32:05;"So there's two of them in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but yeah, the rest are in Texas."
32:05;32:12;"It's run by the same three guys who started it as college students at the University of Texas back in 1995."
32:12;32:17;"So you're a social media strategist. Are you freelance? Do you work for an ad agency? What's the story?"
32:17;32:19;"So ours is in-house."
32:19;32:24;"So I work for the marketing department. We have a corporate office near downtown Austin."
32:24;32:29;"We have a full marketing team, got a few graphic designers, but I'm in charge of most of the social media."
32:29;32:32;"So what's a typical day like for you? Are you just on Twitter all day?"
32:32;32:33;"It's a weird gig."
32:33;32:39;"So yeah, I mean, I'm tweeting to people all day. I also do our Instagram and Facebook."
32:39;32:42;"So we are a restaurant, so I do deal with some complaints."
32:42;32:48;"So people will say, you know, something went wrong with my pickup order or something like that."
32:48;32:53;"And, you know, I'll contact the various store managers and we get that worked out."
32:53;32:58;"But yeah, it's pretty funny because, you know, our corporate office, we have all the accountants and everybody working hard."
32:58;33:04;"I'm over there, you know, giggling at buying comps and trying to come up with funny stuff."
33:04;33:06;"How did you land this gig? What was your background?"
33:06;33:11;"So I actually come from journalism, which is a tough industry to be in."
33:11;33:13;"So I worked for a couple of different publications."
33:13;33:19;"And I interned with Plucker's marketing department when I was in college at UT a couple of years ago."
33:19;33:22;"And then I started my first year of August 1st."
33:22;33:28;"It's kind of a weird landscape right now for the social media strategist for restaurant chains."
33:28;33:29;"It is."
33:29;33:31;"It kind of feels like we're entering phase two."
33:31;33:36;"Yeah, I didn't get that bachelor college degree, so I'm a little ill-equipped there."
33:36;33:38;"But yeah, it's a weird time."
33:38;33:40;"But you went to UT Austin?"
33:40;33:49;"Yeah, so I do have a liberal arts honors degree in religious studies, history, and American studies, which won't help you with anything."
33:49;33:52;"That was going to be my next question."
33:52;33:56;"Which of those fields of study helped you the most running the Plucker's Twitter account?"
33:56;33:58;"So honestly, religious studies."
33:58;33:59;"It can kind of be a cult."
33:59;34:03;"So I wrote my thesis on hip-hop as a religion."
34:03;34:10;"A lot of it was about capitalism and how brands help form our identities."
34:10;34:15;"And a lot of the professors and scholars that I read obviously didn't see it as a good thing."
34:15;34:26;"But I don't think there's really anything wrong with turning to Moon Pie and Plucker's and Snaco and Denny's for our content and entertainment."
34:26;34:30;"It's a dumb time to be alive, but it's pretty fun."
34:30;34:33;"So you don't feel competitive with those other brands?"
34:33;34:34;"You see them doing their thing?"
34:34;34:41;"Like, for instance, when Steakums went on their kind of existential rant about, ""You want to know why people follow brands?"
34:41;34:43;"It's because millennials have nothing to look forward to."""
34:43;34:44;"You were just like, ""Strong."""
34:44;34:48;"It's an honor, sir, to be working in the same industry as you."
34:48;34:52;"As dumb as that sounds, that pretty much sums it up."
34:52;34:56;"I actually know the guy behind the Steakums account, Nathan, and he's a brilliant guy."
34:56;35:01;"I learned a lot from him because it's pretty easy to sell. We're a pretty popular restaurant."
35:01;35:04;"USA Today is named as one of the top wing restaurants in the country."
35:04;35:07;"ESPN is named as one of the top five sports bars."
35:07;35:14;"So people already love Plucker's, whereas I haven't had Steakums, but I know you all discussed that in the last episode."
35:14;35:19;"It's harder to sell frozen beef sheets than wings and beer."
35:19;35:24;"But, yeah, it's interesting because we kind of have what checkers and rallies."
35:24;35:29;"One of our, well, that's what it is, is Friend Brands. So it's ""Frans."""
35:29;35:34;"Wait, who coined the ""Friend Brands"" ""Frans""? Who coined that? Is that out there?"
35:34;35:37;"That is out there. You can search ""checkers and rallies"" for that one."
35:37;35:40;"And we're friends with Sunny D."
35:40;35:42;"Behind the scene, there's no corporate connection."
35:42;35:47;"No. So Steakums, I talk to that guy personally pretty regularly, Nathan."
35:47;35:49;"But the other ones, I don't even know."
35:49;35:55;"A lot of places actually have pretty big teams behind them, like Wendy's and Moon Pie and Denny's definitely do."
35:55;35:58;"And I know like Whataburger, which is a big Texas chain, does."
35:58;36:01;"You build these alliances, these Friend Brand things."
36:01;36:07;"Is it kind of like when a pop star has their squad and they kind of check the boxes, different types of people in different industries?"
36:07;36:10;"And you're like, but then they always have the beef with the person who's the most like them, you know?"
36:10;36:15;"So you're kind of like, oh, yeah, we're cool with Moon Pie and this burger place."
36:15;36:18;"But f*** you, Wingstop. You'll never be ""Frans"" with me."
36:18;36:26;"It's not explicit, but yes, Wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings, especially Buffalo Wild Wings, is one of our biggest competitors."
36:26;36:28;"And they're obviously, you know, nationwide."
36:28;36:36;"But yeah, like so our national joke of the day, hashtag tweet was, you know, here's a terrible joke at Buffalo Wild Wings."
36:36;36:39;"And since they're a bigger account, you know, they can't punch down."
36:39;36:41;"So it's pretty much an easy shot to."
36:41;36:44;"David versus Goliath, you're getting out that slingshot."
36:44;36:54;"For lack of better term, I mean, it is it's like, yeah, we're talking about fried chicken and Twitter, but it is like all good entertainment."
36:54;36:58;"You know, you got a protagonist and antagonist. You got to have drama."
36:58;37:00;"The same as any other entertainment, really."
37:00;37:04;"It's kind of like WWE, you know, you it's ridiculous."
37:04;37:07;"It's absurd, but you can't really look away sometimes."
37:07;37:10;"You know, it is what it is. It's a dumb time to be alive."
37:10;37:17;"But I guess as we've seen, WWE was clearly the biggest influence on our culture."
37:17;37:19;"It really is a dumb time to be alive."
37:19;37:25;"Like, you know, I come from journalism and, you know, for a while it was like, oh, I'm selling out to any corporation."
37:25;37:32;"But it was like you're writing about Donald Trump being compared to Toad the Mushroom from Mario Kart."
37:32;37:34;"So it's a really dumb time to be alive."
37:34;37:38;"The president of the United States is throwing shots on Twitter."
37:38;37:48;"So, you know, you can't I don't think it's fair to judge Moon Pie and Pluckers and Denny's or whoever it may be for, you know, popping off stupid stuff on Twitter."
37:48;37:53;"Whether it's literally the leader of the free world is doing the same, which is pretty scary."
37:53;37:55;"But it's the times we live in."
37:56;37:59;"Fifty thousand on my head is disrespect."
37:59;38:02;"So offended that I had to double check."
38:02;38:05;"I'm always take the money over."
38:05;38:07;"That's why they need me out the way with you."
38:07;38:12;"It's bad. Got a lot of blood and it's cold."
38:12;38:15;"They keep trying to get me for my soul."
38:15;38:18;"Thankful for the women that I know."
38:18;38:23;"Can't go 50/50 with no."
38:23;38:27;"Every month I'm supposed to pay a bill and get what you want."
38:27;38:30;"I still got like seven years of doing what I want."
38:30;38:35;"My dad still got child support from 1991."
38:35;38:41;"Out of town, people love to pop a lot and come around where the flock of Jody."
38:41;38:44;"He does. Put it down."
38:44;38:47;"That's if I'm cool. I'm upset."
38:47;38:50;"Hundred thousand on my head is disrespect."
38:50;38:53;"So offended that I had to double check."
38:53;38:57;"So what's the meanest thing you ever said to Buffalo Wild Wings?"
38:57;39:01;"And you have to run it up the flagpole. I mean, you're in the office, you know, so say you get an idea."
39:01;39:06;"You're like, I'm going to tell Buffalo Wild Wings to pluck my today."
39:06;39:11;"Do you have to go to the CEO and say, listen, this is kind of controversial."
39:11;39:15;"It's a little edgy, but I really think this could be big for us."
39:15;39:18;"So it is. It is great because my bosses are incredible."
39:18;39:28;"They give me like so much creative freedom, which a lot of companies don't, because one of them was this is when I was first starting out and they had really thrown shop at
other restaurants."
39:28;39:35;"So we have a weekly meeting where I recap and it's me basically saying, all right, boss, we posted a picture of you all from 1995."
39:35;39:38;"They thought you were a zaddy and you can get it."
39:38;39:40;"And then I had to explain what that means."
39:40;39:45;"And then I explain my bad tweets and I say, yeah, boss, this is what the kids say."
39:45;39:48;"This ain't it. So they didn't like that one."
39:48;39:57;"But with Buffalo Wild Wings is National Joke Day and it was trending and that was my first one to hit like a thousand or two thousand."
39:57;39:59;"I think it ended up with over like five thousand or something."
39:59;40:05;"But it was funny because I had to come to that meeting and they're like, yeah, you probably would have asked us that before you posted it."
40:05;40:07;"We probably would have said no."
40:07;40:11;"And that specifically you told Buffalo Wild Wings that ain't it chief."
40:11;40:18;"Yeah, they're a joke. And occasionally because we do have some older customers and there's one time where I was just like, hey, like I was not happy."
40:18;40:21;"And I said something like, hey, slide into my DMs."
40:21;40:25;"And he did slide into our DMs with, hey, I'm not a hey."
40:25;40:28;"This is like, you know, the classic old man grumpy."
40:28;40:30;"So it does backfire sometimes."
40:30;40:33;"But overall, people seem to like it."
40:33;40:36;"I don't want to slide into your BMs."
40:36;40:39;"It was literally he's like, let me talk to corporate."
40:39;40:44;"I was like, oh, man, like how do I tell the guy that's just like, hey, Sam, fuck me up."
40:44;40:47;"It's like, well, you contact the right people you need to talk to."
40:47;40:49;"You're just treating it the real life Hank Hill."
40:49;40:51;"Damn it, pluggers."
40:51;40:56;"I just want I just wanted to get some buffalo wings for my family."
40:56;40:58;"Slide into where?"
40:58;41:00;"We have restaurants all around that area."
41:00;41:03;"So you're being a lot more accurate than you realize."
41:03;41:13;"So we talked about on the show before about how as there's been a slight backlash, a very slight backlash to kind of corporate brand Twitter's and corporate brand
Twitter humor."
41:13;41:29;"I've occasionally seen these tweets where somebody says, you know, guys, when you're being a real a-hole to the you know, one of these corporate accounts, you're not
really thinking about the fact that you have a poorly paid young person probably in their 20s, maybe even intern doing this."
41:29;41:35;"So when you tell, you know, staycums to shut the fuck up, you're being really cruel."
41:35;41:47;"Do you find that the deeper you go as a social media strategist for pluggers, that when somebody disses pluggers or maybe says something mean to the brand on Twitter
that you start to take it as a personal slight?"
41:47;41:53;"I will say first and foremost, that brand Twitter is a million times nicer than journalism."
41:53;42:00;"Twitter, anything you would write as a journalist, someone hates you and someone will tell you and you'll be like, well, did you read the third line of the article?"
42:00;42:03;"Nope. We saw the headline and we told you you could go kill yourself."
42:03;42:04;"Right. Wow."
42:04;42:12;"Whereas brand is what's great about the freedom that I have is if I have a bad joke and I have a lot of those, they'll be like, this ain't it, chief."
42:12;42:14;"Or like, dude, this is effing stupid."
42:14;42:16;"I'll be like, oh, man, I'm sorry."
42:16;42:17;"I'll try harder next time."
42:17;42:23;"Or, you know, sometimes people will tear me up about, you know, service or something at one of the restaurants."
42:23;42:26;"I'm like, guys, like I'm just sitting here tweeting, bro."
42:26;42:28;"Like I'll pass your information along."
42:28;42:30;"Has a hater ever gotten under your skin?"
42:30;42:31;"Yes."
42:31;42:32;"A pluggers hater."
42:32;42:36;"Absolutely. I mean, like there are certain times where like they don't get your joke."
42:36;42:40;"And it becomes just as personal as if you tweeted it from a personal account."
42:40;42:41;"More personal. That's my work."
42:41;42:44;"Whereas my personal account is like, all right, I'm not putting any thought of this."
42:44;42:46;"Where it's like, no, no, guys, I do this for a living."
42:46;42:47;"Like, OK."
42:47;42:49;"Oh, wow. So it's the opposite."
42:49;42:55;"It's even more personal because when they diss the pluggers account, they're dissing you and your job."
42:55;42:56;"Your craftsmanship."
42:56;42:57;"And your craftsmanship."
42:57;42:58;"How do you hold yourself back?"
42:58;43:00;"You make a joke and somebody is like, this ain't it, chief."
43:00;43:01;"That doesn't even make sense."
43:01;43:03;"And you're like, it does make sense."
43:03;43:05;"Maybe you're just f***ing stupid."
43:05;43:06;"Do you have to hold yourself back?"
43:06;43:11;"Y'all probably hate this because this is exactly the dumb s*** about Brad Twitter."
43:11;43:14;"There was a guy, so we posted Zach Prescott."
43:14;43:17;"He was doing a dance inspired by Conor McGregor."
43:17;43:19;"So it was a big gif video going around."
43:19;43:20;"So we posted it."
43:20;43:24;"It was like something real simple and basic, like me walking into pluggers."
43:24;43:28;"And someone quote tweeted and says, this meme's trash."
43:28;43:29;"Pluggers is trash."
43:29;43:32;"Cowgirls, that's a big diss for the cowboys."
43:32;43:33;"It's all trash."
43:33;43:36;"You know, go f*** yourself or something."
43:36;43:40;"And so we responded to him with pluck off, Robert."
43:40;43:43;"And then he quote tweeted that and said all for clout."
43:43;43:48;"And then I quote tweeted that and said something like for clout, fam, you have 47 followers."
43:48;43:51;"And that's gotten like almost a million impressions for us."
43:51;43:54;"So it's like literally like a lot of times they're not wrong."
43:54;43:56;"Like this meme sucks."
43:56;43:57;"And I'm like, you know what?"
43:57;44:02;"Like if I saw this across my timeline and I hadn't tried hard to make it, I'd probably say this is pretty stupid too."
44:02;44:06;"But it's great because people talk s***."
44:06;44:12;"Rather than, you know, having to send them a handwritten, you know, apology, you can literally fire them back up."
44:12;44:14;"And the audience loves it."
44:14;44:17;"It's like classic WWE, like no one's actually getting hurt."
44:17;44:20;"But oh, look, a brand said something mean."
44:20;44:22;"Like they get a kick out of that."
44:22;44:25;"The standards are extremely low for brands, which is why I love them."
46:04;46:10;"You ever get anybody from the Buffalo area, you guys do like a funny tweet or something, and they're just like,"
46:10;46:13;"""You know what, honestly, guys, shut the f*** up. You're from Texas."
46:13;46:18;"You have barbecue, you got breakfast tacos, you have all this s***. You guys are fake wangs."
46:18;46:22;"How dare you build a whole brand out of something that comes from Buffalo?"""
46:22;46:26;"We actually had guns in Buffalo, but it was mostly been positive."
46:26;46:29;"We had a real viral tweet. It's got over 100,000 retweets."
46:29;46:35;"When we called out Jake Paul, which was like, I've dreamed my whole life of having something go viral,"
46:35;46:38;"and it did, and it was the dumbest thing I've ever done."
46:38;46:43;"What exactly was the tweet? Jake Paul's a YouTuber that everybody hates, for the people listening at home."
46:43;46:47;"So it's probably about 3.30 in the afternoon."
46:47;46:53;"I'm bored and ready to go home because no one's tweeting at us because they usually tweet when they're coming to the restaurant."
46:53;46:57;"So I see Jake Paul trending because who's the other guy?"
46:57;47:00;"Shane Dawson was doing some big YouTube series about him."
47:00;47:02;"So it's like blowing up on Twitter."
47:02;47:07;"And so I said something dumb like, ""Oh no, Jake Paul's trending."
47:07;47:11;"I'm going to Pluckers to avoid this nonsense with like a food pic."""
47:11;47:14;"And so what's great is like I do social media for a living."
47:14;47:20;"I know it's like scumbag marketing in a lot of ways, but Jake Paul, we didn't even tag Jake Paul."
47:20;47:22;"Jake Paul is searching his own name."
47:22;47:26;"So he comes and responds to it with, ""Hey, can I get an eight piece?"""
47:26;47:31;"Which was like our real fans, and that's the best part is we have our own real fans that are like,"
47:31;47:36;"""Dude, Pluckers doesn't even sell out at eight counts. It's five, 10, or 15."""
47:36;47:40;"But that was probably about a month or two since I started."
47:40;47:46;"And that one, I kind of panicked, and so I called my boss because by the time he responded, it was like 7.30 or 8."
47:46;47:50;"And so I called my boss, and I'm like, ""Oh, [expletive] dude, Jake Paul actually responded."
47:50;47:52;"What do we do? Do we knife to him and take the free press?"""
47:52;47:54;"He's like, ""Dude, we'll just block them."""
47:54;47:59;"So we screencapped his, ""Can I get an eight count or whatever?"""
47:59;48:04;"Then we screencapped us blocking them, and then we tweeted that with just, ""No, period."""
48:04;48:11;"And it got over like 17 million impressions, and it was a dumb way to go viral."
48:11;48:16;"I spent my whole life writing serious articles and having much funnier jokes, and it's like,"
48:16;48:21;"""Oh, I told Jake Paul no, and now 17 million people have seen it."""
48:21;48:27;"And this is a dream come true, and it's also in a lot of ways much less satisfying."
48:27;48:31;"I guess he's one of the few people that you were just allowed to do that to."
48:31;48:37;"Jake Paul loved it. We unblocked Jake Paul, and he retweeted it, and he loves the free press too."
48:37;48:41;"If anybody knows how to game the scumbag social media, it's like,"
48:41;48:45;"""Jake Paul is more shameless than we are. At least when we're doing dumb stuff all day,"
48:45;48:47;"you know we're trying to sell chicken."""
48:47;48:51;"Whereas him, he's always selling something, and everybody's selling something,"
48:51;48:54;"whether it's clicks or views, but it's like, ""No, we're selling you chicken."""
48:54;49:00;"So in a lot of ways, Brand Twitter is more authentic than a lot of other stuff you consume as media."
49:00;49:05;"So your philosophy is basically that the world is so f---ed up,"
49:05;49:10;"and everybody out there from the politicians to the journalists to the social media people,"
49:10;49:12;"they're all lying about it. It's all for sale."
49:12;49:15;"But the only person who's being honest about it is Brand Twitter."
49:15;49:17;"So in a way, there's something refreshing about it."
49:17;49:19;"It's the man who sold the world."
49:19;49:23;"Well, no, okay, look. You have to promote your brand, right?"
49:23;49:27;"You want people to come to your concerts. You're proud of the music you create."
49:27;49:30;"We're proud of our food. We're proud of the work we do."
49:30;49:34;"But at the end of the day, this is our job, and we've got to get people--"
49:34;49:38;"we want people to pay attention to us. We want people to come to our stores and enjoy our stuff."
49:38;49:42;"So yeah, I don't feel bad about it. I stand by our product."
49:42;49:46;"If I was doing social media, I used to work for ClickBait,"
49:46;49:50;"so I would be the one writing about the latest outrage about Jake Paul,"
49:50;49:52;"and people would say, ""Why are you writing about this?"""
49:52;49:59;"More people would click on that than if you write an in-depth analysis of the history of racism in UT."
49:59;50:00;"No one gives a s---."
50:00;50:04;"But if you say, ""Oh, here's the latest 'Catch Me Outside' girl video,"""
50:04;50:07;"it takes you two seconds to write. It gets more views than anything,"
50:07;50:11;"and the incentives are terrible, but it's like, yeah, that's what people are clicking on."
50:11;50:14;"Whereas now, it's like, ""No, I don't have to do this for clicks."""
50:14;50:18;"It's like, yeah, I'm selling chicken. It's good chicken. I stand by this chicken."
50:18;50:21;"I've gained way too much weight now that I'm getting free chicken."
50:21;50:23;"I think it's pure in a lot of ways."
50:23;50:25;"So you're saying Pluckers is not healthy to eat?"
50:25;50:26;"You heard it here, folks."
50:26;50:28;"You heard it-- [laughs]"
50:28;50:30;"Let's get Jake Paul on the line."
50:30;50:35;"You guys should start a beef with another class. It's like Austin-based chain."
50:35;50:38;"Whole Foods. Why don't you start a beef with Whole Foods and be like,"
50:38;50:43;"""You don't represent Austin. Pluckers does. We're the real Austin."""
50:43;50:49;"So that's the other thing about starting beefs is a lot of these guys don't have a good social media presence."
50:49;50:53;"So it's like, I can talk s--- all day, but if they're not going to say anything back to us,"
50:53;50:54;"we're just screaming into the void."
50:54;50:57;"Like the wrestling analogy, you need somebody to get in the ring with you."
50:57;50:59;"Yeah, no, that's like a perfect analogy."
50:59;51:04;"You need someone to duke it out with, and it's a dumb time to be alive is the moral of the story."
51:04;51:07;"I like that you say that a lot. You should pitch that to your bosses."
51:07;51:12;"Like, ""Guys, new Pluckers slogan. It's a dumb time to be alive. Come through."""
51:12;51:13;"Pluck it."
51:13;51:16;"Pluck it. [laughs]"
51:16;51:19;"All right, well, thanks, Mac. We appreciate that insight."
51:19;51:23;"And currently, you guys have about 50,000 Twitter followers?"
51:23;51:27;"Yeah, about 46, 47. That's right. Hopefully, you can get us up to 50."
51:27;51:31;"I don't know why we have so few Twitter followers for time crisis."
51:31;51:34;"We're clapping back at people enough. Yeah, if you can just retweet us a bunch."
51:34;51:38;"You got to get Seinfeld to start telling people to pluck off more often."
51:38;51:40;"We really do need to start selling something."
51:40;51:44;"Maybe we should really start that time crisis for Austin Flakes, just to have something to sell."
51:44;51:48;"Because I feel like when you have something to sell, then now you got some skin in the game,"
51:48;51:49;"and then you can really start."
51:49;51:51;"Because time crisis, we got no competition."
51:51;51:54;"We're not going to pick a fight with a podcast."
51:54;51:57;"We're internet streaming radio. We're kind of in our own lane."
51:57;51:59;"And also, that'd be so personal."
51:59;52:02;"Hey, Mark Maron, pluck off. And that's not even our lane anyway."
52:02;52:03;"Who are you?"
52:03;52:05;"Time crisis is too in our own lane."
52:05;52:08;"Anyway, thanks for calling in, Mac. We appreciate it."
52:08;52:11;"And good luck to everybody. Pluckers."
52:11;52:12;"Thanks so much, y'all."
52:12;52:13;"Have a good one."
52:13;52:14;"Bye."
52:18;52:21;"Spoken wasn't well"
52:21;52:25;"Although I wasn't there"
52:25;52:29;"You said I was a friend"
52:29;52:33;"Which came as a surprise"
52:33;52:37;"I spoke into his eyes"
52:37;52:41;"I thought you died alone"
52:41;52:45;"A long, long time ago"
52:45;52:51;"Oh no, not me"
52:51;52:55;"We never lost control"
52:55;52:59;"Face to face"
52:59;53:03;"Of a man who sold the world"
53:03;53:04;"You're listening to"
53:04;53:06;"[beatboxing]"
53:06;53:07;"Time Crisis"
53:07;53:09;"On Beats 1"
53:09;53:10;"That was a hell of a call."
53:10;53:13;"It's also interesting that he had the background as a journalist."
53:13;53:14;"Right."
53:14;53:18;"Because he's trying to make the case, being a social media strategist is like being an honest journalist."
53:18;53:20;"We're all selling some bullsh*t."
53:20;53:22;"I don't think that's true of like real journalism."
53:22;53:23;"No."
53:23;53:25;"Like old school, and of course there's a lot of people still doing it."
53:25;53:26;"Matt Taibbi."
53:26;53:28;"[laughter]"
53:28;53:29;"But, you know."
53:29;53:38;"No, but I think, I can imagine because a certain side of journalism has become clickbait, awful, just headline grabbing trash."
53:38;53:47;"I can imagine that if you're a serious journalist and you can't make a living doing that, and little by little you get sucked into kind of like the clickbait bullsh*t
echo chamber kind of world."
53:47;53:50;"And then you're like, this is what journalism is?"
53:50;53:53;"And then somebody's like, hey, you want to do social media for pluckers?"
53:53;53:55;"You might be like, that sounds like step up."
53:55;53:56;"I can see that."
53:56;54:00;"You know one thing I'll say, I do love buffalo wings."
54:00;54:02;"I'm not a big fan of wings."
54:02;54:03;"You don't like buffalo wings?"
54:03;54:04;"No."
54:04;54:05;"Why?"
54:05;54:06;"They're kind of just a mess."
54:06;54:09;"You gotta eat like nine of them."
54:09;54:11;"It's just kind of gross, all those little bones."
54:11;54:12;"It's just kind of like your--"
54:12;54:13;"What about boneless wings though?"
54:13;54:14;"Yeah, what about boneless wings?"
54:14;54:16;"I mean, like chicken nuggets?"
54:16;54:17;"Is that what you're saying?"
54:17;54:19;"No, there's boneless buffalo wings."
54:19;54:20;"I've never seen it."
54:20;54:21;"Any-tizers."
54:21;54:22;"That's a Tyson prant."
54:22;54:24;"God, this is dark."
54:24;54:26;"They make something called any-tizers."
54:26;54:27;"What is it called?"
54:27;54:29;"As I say it out loud, it's such a bad name."
54:29;54:31;"It's like appetizers, except it's any."
54:31;54:33;"Like A-N-Y?"
54:33;54:34;"A-N-Y-tizer."
54:34;54:35;"Any-tizers."
54:35;54:36;"I don't get it."
54:36;54:38;"I guess it's like appetizers you can eat any time."
54:38;54:40;"That's a terrible name."
54:40;54:41;"You're familiar with Tyson Foods."
54:41;54:42;"Oh, yeah."
54:42;54:44;"Anyway, they have something called any-tizers,"
54:44;54:46;"and they have boneless buffalo wings."
54:46;54:48;"I just think buffalo wings taste great,"
54:48;54:50;"especially if they're a little bit crispy."
54:50;54:53;"Have you ever been to the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York,"
54:53;54:54;"that's supposedly where they were invented?"
54:54;54:55;"No."
54:55;54:56;"Went there on tour once."
54:56;54:57;"You're saying wangs?"
54:57;55:01;"The word is wing, like the wing of a plane or a chicken, I guess."
55:01;55:06;"But because I know a wings place that's called Big Wangs,"
55:06;55:08;"it's in Hollywood."
55:08;55:09;"You know this place, Jake?"
55:09;55:10;"No, I don't."
55:10;55:11;"Big Wangs."
55:11;55:12;"I've never been in there,"
55:12;55:14;"but because I've walked past this place three to four times,"
55:14;55:19;"it got so stuck in my head that now every time I talk about buffalo wings,"
55:19;55:22;"I like to say buffalo wangs."
55:22;55:24;"Buffalo wild wangs."
55:24;55:27;"I like that the name wild is in Buffalo wild wings."
55:27;55:29;"Yeah, where does the wild come from?"
55:29;55:32;"Nothing even remotely wild."
55:32;55:35;"I guess they get pretty spicy, pretty hot."
55:35;55:40;"So anyway, it's just one of those little things that makes me me."
55:40;55:43;"Yeah, it's your essence."
55:43;55:47;"And again, I know we're going to get some haters in the comments"
55:47;55:52;"saying wangs instead of wings is not a replacement for having a personality."
55:52;55:55;"And you know what?"
55:55;55:58;"I never said it was a replacement for having a personality."
55:58;56:00;"Is it part of my personality?"
56:00;56:02;"You bet your ass."
56:02;56:04;"Is it a major part?"
56:04;56:05;"Yes."
56:05;56:09;"Yes."
56:09;56:14;"Look, the three things that define me, my love of music."
56:14;56:16;"Everybody knows that about me."
56:16;56:18;"Ezra is wild about music."
56:18;56:20;"I'm wild about music."
56:20;56:22;"He likes everything."
56:22;56:23;"I love all music."
56:23;56:25;"Everybody knows this about me."
56:25;56:27;"Everything except country."
56:27;56:29;"I even love country."
56:29;56:33;"And people know this about me because, again, I'm not trying to be presumptuous."
56:33;56:38;"Not everybody knows me, but the people who do know me know a few things about me."
56:38;56:42;"One is they've seen me play music because they know I'm a musician."
56:42;56:44;"Two, they've heard me talk about music."
56:44;56:47;"And when they listen to Time Crisis and listen to me and Jake Chop It Up,"
56:47;56:50;"we're not talking about Vampire Weekend all the time."
56:50;56:51;"We're talking about--"
56:51;56:52;"Doors."
56:53;56:55;"We're talking about the dead."
56:55;56:56;"Steve Miller."
56:56;56:57;"We're not talking about Steve Miller."
56:57;56:58;"We're talking about other artists."
56:58;57:00;"So that lets people know that I'm a fan."
57:00;57:04;"So they know that I play music and I listen to music and I discuss music."
57:04;57:05;"So I'm wild about music."
57:05;57:07;"That's one of the big three."
57:07;57:11;"The second is I'm nuts about streaming internet radio."
57:11;57:14;"Not podcasts, but internet streaming radio."
57:14;57:15;"And they know this about me."
57:15;57:17;"I mean, you're listening to the show."
57:17;57:18;"It is the only ethical content."
57:18;57:22;"It's the only ethical content in 2018."
57:22;57:28;"And third, when I'm talking about buffalo wings, I say buffalo wangs."
57:28;57:31;"And that's the big three that makes me me."
57:31;57:37;"And I want all the listeners to tweet @TimeCrisis2000 the hashtag"
57:37;57:42;"#TheBigThreeThatMakeMeMe."
57:42;57:47;"And I know it's going to look like #TheBigThreeThatMakeMeme."
57:47;57:49;"And that's okay because it is kind of a meme."
57:49;57:51;"A meme is a replicable idea."
57:51;57:53;"Just watch your capitalization."
57:53;57:55;"Yeah, the capitalization will help."
57:55;57:58;"But #TheBigThreeThatMakeMeme."
57:58;57:59;"Number three or spelled out?"
57:59;58:00;"Numeral three."
58:00;58:03;"#TheBigThreeThatMakeMeme."
58:03;58:07;"Because we do live in a time when everybody wants to tear each other down."
58:07;58:08;"Especially on social media."
58:08;58:11;"And I know, Seinfeld, you've gotten into some hot water there."
58:11;58:12;"Oh, yeah."
58:12;58:13;"You've dealt with haters."
58:13;58:14;"Oh, yeah, scalding."
58:14;58:16;"So we know everybody's trying to tear each other down."
58:16;58:20;"And, yes, we're not that different from one another."
58:20;58:21;"I'll admit that."
58:21;58:22;"We're all human beings."
58:22;58:25;"People will tweet at pluckers, ""I've already seen this meme."
58:25;58:27;"You're stupid."""
58:27;58:28;"Well, hold on."
58:28;58:32;"That's not the whole point of memes is that they're replicable ideas that we share"
58:32;58:35;"and drive into the ground until they're not funny anymore."
58:35;58:37;"That's part of what makes us human."
58:37;58:41;"We all want to joke about Chipotle, and then eventually it's like, ""Shut up."
58:41;58:42;"It's just a restaurant."""
58:42;58:44;"But this is part of the human experience, right?"
58:44;58:47;"So everybody's trying to tear each other down and say, ""You're not original."""
58:47;58:50;"I even see it on some popular meme accounts that I follow."
58:50;58:53;"People sounding off on the comments saying, ""I already saw this meme."
58:53;58:55;"This format's old."""
58:55;58:58;"Maybe we're thinking a little too much about memes and we're not thinking enough about"
58:58;58:59;"me-me."
58:59;59:04;"So I want to know, because I'm interested in you as a person who has some slightly different"
59:04;59:08;"characteristics than the millions of other people who are very similar to you."
59:08;59:10;"#TheBigThreeThatMakeMeMe."
59:10;59:17;"#Well, if you want to sing out, sing out #And if you want to be free, be free #'Cause"
59:17;59:27;"there's a million things to be #You know that there are #And if you want to live high,"
59:27;59:35;"live high #And if you want to live low, live low #'Cause there's a million ways to go"
59:35;59:48;"#You know that there are #You can do what you want #The opportunity's all #And if you"
59:48;01:00:01;"find a new way #You can do it today #You can make it all true #And you can make it undo"
01:00:01;01:00:12;"It's easy, you only need to know."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"We're gonna start a viral hashtag and I think it's finally gonna get us some followers."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Yeah, I think this one is gonna be trending."
01:00:17;01:00:21;"Seinfeld, since you're in charge of our social media, which by the way, it bothers me that"
01:00:21;01:00:26;"people always thinking that I run, even Pluckers thinks that I run the account."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"It's timecrisis 2000."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Seinfeld 2000."
01:00:30;01:00:35;"But anyway, since you run a social media account, I really think this is a million dollar idea."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Hashtag the big three that make me me."
01:00:37;01:00:41;"And I think if you could get some really big name celebrities to do it, that's usually"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"the way to kind of really get something going."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"I'm thinking Kim Kardashian."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Yep."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Allie Main."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"Wait, is her last name Main too?"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"They get married in the movie?"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Oh, okay."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Oh, no."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"I may have said too much."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Wow."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"They probably don't."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"I don't know."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Seinfeld, just get on it."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Oh God."
01:01:01;01:01:05;"Crack open your Rolodex and let's get the big three that make me me trending."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"One last thing."
01:01:06;01:01:11;"We were talking the past few episodes about how we found out that after Jerry Garcia died,"
01:01:11;01:01:16;"Steve Miller, the coward, said some pretty unkind things about the Grateful Dead."
01:01:16;01:01:19;"We've been trying to get in touch with him, but no luck."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Huh, Seinfeld?"
01:01:20;01:01:25;"We tried a couple of times through social media and via email to his publicist."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"Very polite email and a nice follow up and nothing."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"Really?"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Yeah."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"So we were just talking about all these different musicians who talk about each other and we"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"talked about how Steve Miller talked about the dead after Jerry died and we found out"
01:01:37;01:01:43;"that Tom York talked about Jim Morrison, even going as far as to fat shame him years after"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"the man was dead, couldn't even defend himself."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"And I actually came across this information myself because after we had that conversation,"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"I went home and I just, you know, for fun, Googled Grateful Dead and the doors, see what"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"kind of connections there were."
01:01:55;01:02:00;"And I found out something pretty disturbing and so did a guy named Sam who emailed us"
01:02:00;01:02:05;"and I won't read the whole email, but he says, ""Greetings TC crew, I'm a long time listener."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"First time email, big fan of the show."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Love what you guys got going on."""
01:02:08;01:02:13;"He's a borderline millennial born in '81 in Nuevo Haven CT like Jake."
01:02:13;01:02:17;"He was listening to the show and he felt like he had to tell us this."
01:02:17;01:02:22;"He came across an interview in some casual reading that's pretty shocking."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Here's an excerpt."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"This is a direct quote from Jerry Garcia."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"""I never liked the doors."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"I found them terribly offensive when we played with them."""
01:02:29;01:02:33;"It was back when Jim Morrison was just a pure Mick Jagger copy."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"That was his whole shot that he was a Mick Jagger imitation, not vocally, but his moves,"
01:02:37;01:02:41;"his whole physical appearance were totally stolen from right around Mick Jagger's 1965"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"tour of the States."
01:02:42;01:02:46;"He used to move around a lot before he started to earn reputation as a poet, which I thought"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"was really undeserved."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"Rambo was great at 18, 19, and Verlaine."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"Those guys were great."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Jim Morrison was not great."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"I can't believe these words came out of Jerry's mouth."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"This sounds like some Trump shit."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Jim Morrison was never great."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"I'm sorry."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I could never see what it was about the doors."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"This doesn't sound like our Jerry."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"He had a competitive edge."
01:03:06;01:03:10;"It almost made me wonder if you could create a whole circle of musicians talking shit about"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"each other."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"So for instance, Steve Miller talked shit about Jerry Garcia."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"Jerry Garcia talked shit about the doors."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Who did Jim Morrison talk shit about?"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"Did Jim Morrison talk shit about anyone?"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"On the dead?"
01:03:20;01:03:23;"If Jim Morrison talked shit about Steve Miller, then you got a circle."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"So that's another thing that the fans at home could come up with."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Can you do like a six degrees of Kevin Bacon type thing?"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Can you create a full circle?"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"A full circle of life of musicians talking shit about each other."
01:03:34;01:03:41;"I imagine you can always go to Liam Gallagher or Noel Gallagher, both of them."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Six degrees of the Gallagher bros."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"That's going to help."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"But if you can create a whole, like a full circle, because the truth is a lot of musicians,"
01:03:47;01:03:51;"they were very sensitive, but a lot of us do talk shit a lot."
01:03:51;01:03:56;"It's like, could you connect like Jerry Garcia to like Kanye in like two moves or three moves?"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Right."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"I'm sure you could."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"Yeah."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Kanye talked shit about Taylor Swift."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"Taylor Swift talked shit about Martha Blackburn."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Who's that?"
01:04:04;01:04:08;"She's a Republican, Republican Senator from Tennessee."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"So we're taking it out of the music."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Yeah."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"I'd prefer to keep it in music."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"I don't know."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Yeah."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"It's going to, it's hard, but I wonder if anybody can do it."

01:11:17;01:11:19;"- It's pretty tight"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"'cause they're all like working class English guys"

01:11:31;01:11:32;"- Things moved very quickly."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"So it was punk and then kind of like,"

01:11:36;01:11:38;"- Like how quickly did this shift happen?"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"- There were just so many styles happening."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"So many like youth cultures, punk and goth"

01:11:47;01:11:49;"And then kind of they and Duran Duran break out"

01:11:51;01:11:53;"almost like the opposite of punk."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"- Like soft rock."
01:11:54;01:11:57;"- Soft rock, sophisticated, wearing suits,"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"you know, like Duran Duran."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"They said like their videos were like fancy."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"And then just like, you know,"
01:12:01;01:12:04;"the bassist in the band just writes this like"
01:12:04;01:12:07;"beautiful jazz influenced modern pop song."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- Right."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- It's like a few years earlier,"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"these guys would have just been like punk rockers basically."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- So they were like 23 or something here?"
01:12:13;01:12:14;"- Yeah."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"- Yeah, I would have guessed these guys were like 30."
01:12:16;01:12:19;"- No, they were like young heartthrobs at this point."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"- This is the sound of my soul."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"- That's really is the sound,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"like the vocal sound of that era."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"- It's great."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Back to 2018."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"- I know you."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"- Mia by Bad Bunny featuring Drake."

01:12:52;01:12:54;"That's Drake singing in Spanish?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Oh wow."

01:13:22;01:13:23;"Seinfeld?"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"- Is it the woman's name?"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"- That's a good guess."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"- Oh, this is in Spanish."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"(laughing)"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"- Come on, man."

01:13:38;01:13:39;"Mia means mine."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Okay."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"- How'd you crunch so fast?"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"- You studied Spanish?"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"- Oh my God."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- So what's it about?"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"- They're talking to a woman"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"who's the center of attention."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"Everyone wants to have it,"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"but both remind her that she said she was theirs"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"and nobody else."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"It's like the girl is mine, but."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"- Sounds kind of controlling."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Oh, but you mean Bad Bunny and Drake"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"are just kind of like,"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"are they talking to each other in the song?"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"- It sounds like a girl has told both Bad Bunny and Drake"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"that she is theirs,"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"and then they're both like."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"- Oh, so it's like."
01:14:09;01:14:09;"- It's like the same girl."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"- Same girl, same damn girl."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"- I think it's like a Spanish same girl."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"- So they're talking to each other,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"being like, that girl said she was yours,"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"she told me she was mine."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"- Oh, and it looks like in the chorus."
01:14:18;01:14:19;"- Bad Bunny's like, Drake,"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"I didn't know you was fluent in Spanish."

01:14:26;01:14:28;"- Looks like one of the lines is,"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"in English, tell him that you are mine."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"So Drake is like telling the girl like,"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"hey, tell Bad Bunny, like, you're my girl."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"And then the other one's like,"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"no, you tell Drake that."
01:14:39;01:14:39;"- That you're my girl."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Like, I'm putting the responsibility on her."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"- And she's like, you guys are on the same song together."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"I'm not even on the song."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"If you're on the same song with somebody,"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"you're kind of like being in the same room as them."

01:15:03;01:15:05;"- It's considered canon in the BBU"

01:15:09;01:15:15;"Drake can communicate some basic ideas,"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"including which girls belong to him in Spanish."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"In the OVO universe,"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"it was widely understood that Drake could only speak English"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"but in the BBU, he has one additional power, which is."

01:19:28;01:19:30;"My first guess would be like,"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"well, if you're two islands in a stream,"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"means you're not connected."
01:19:33;01:19:33;"- Right."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"- It means that maybe occasionally"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"you make love with each other,"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"you ride it together,"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"but at the end of the day,"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"you're two just separate islands."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"But that's not really what the song is about"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"'cause it's Islands in the Stream,"
01:19:45;01:19:46;"that is what we are."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"No one in between."
01:19:47;01:19:50;"There's always something between two islands, right?"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"That's kind of the definition."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"There's some stream. - Water."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- There's a little stream."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"- Yeah."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"- Islands in the stream, that is what we are."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"No one in between."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"How can we be wrong?"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"I just told you how you could be wrong."
01:20:01;01:20:04;"I think it was a weird thing to say."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Sail away with me to another world."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"This is the epitome of crazy mixed metaphor."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"I love it, but it's a crazy mix."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"Islands can't sail away."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Guess they're not islands anymore."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Guess that metaphor is done."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"Sail away with me to another world"

01:20:19;01:20:21;"From one lover to another, aha."
01:20:21;01:20:23;"Okay, from one lover to another."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Is this thing that they're each other's"
01:20:24;01:20:28;"like long-term booty call?"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"- Wow."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"I think that's too specific a read."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"- But we rely on each other, aha."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"From one lover, oh, are they're saying from me to you?"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"- Yeah."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"- Okay, that does make sense."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"I always thought of it as like a really weird song"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"that's kind of just like,"
01:20:42;01:20:47;"every few years I end up having sex with you."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"- Passing through town and you were."
01:20:49;01:20:54;"- Even though we're both married to two different people."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"I almost imagined it was like people,"
01:20:56;01:21:00;"I'm picturing it's like Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers."
01:21:00;01:21:00;"You know, they've each gone through"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"like five marriages or some (beep)"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"but every time they see each other at the CMT Awards,"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"it's on."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"- It's on."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"(laughing)"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"- And it's just like this."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"- Slips in like, subtly slips in the key."
01:21:16;01:21:16;"- Right."

01:21:25;01:21:27;"They just lock eyes."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"Not a word spoken."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"- 1981, CMT Awards."
01:21:31;01:21:34;"- 1981, it's their third decade."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"- Oh my God."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"- Of this shameful affair."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"All this love we feel needs no conversation."
01:21:40;01:21:43;"We ride it together, aha, making love with the tracks."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"From one lover to another, aha."
01:21:45;01:21:48;"I think it's almost like they were each other's"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"just like dirty, shameful affair."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"And they're like reaching this point."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"They're each on their fifth marriage"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"and they're just like,"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"we've been bouncing from one lover to another"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"but we always keep coming back to each other."
01:21:59;01:22:03;"We got that kind of special CMT Awards backstage 1980 love"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"that requires no conversation."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"And here we are, we ain't getting no younger."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"Should we just cut this (beep) and get together?"
01:22:10;01:22:13;"Should we just run away together, sell away?"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Maybe that's what this song is about."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"- It's like Brokeback Mountain."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- Kind of."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"- Hetero."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"- Yeah."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"- Hetero, broke back, it makes no sense but."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"(laughing)"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"At the end of that movie, this is so tortured."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"They're on year 20 of this affair"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"and it's just like so brutal."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"- They wish that they could sell away together."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"Get away from this (beep) charade."

01:43:33;01:43:34;"- Right, but if that--"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"- Jack Antonoff though."
01:43:35;01:43:37;"- Did he write that?"
01:43:37;01:43:38;"Or was it the other guy?"
01:43:38;01:43:41;"- I'm sure they're all credited as writing it together."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"We don't know."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- He came up with that vocal melody."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"Should start writing songs for Gaga."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"- I'm guessing that was the singer,"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"but I don't really know."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"- Yeah."

01:46:21;01:46:22;"- Who? - Corgan."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"- (laughs) What?"
01:46:23;01:46:26;"- He could."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"I'm just thinking of like--"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"- I mean, you're right, his (beep) in the '90s"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"kinda had some of this flavor."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"- I doubt he'd want to."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"- You know, I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna sit down"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"and see if I can come up with a Jim Stineman type song."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"- So am I. - All right."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"- We'll compare notes in two weeks."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"- Maybe we'll come up with enough parts to put together."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"We can be a co-write."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"- Wait, should we share the same lyrical theme?"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"- Well, you know what it is?"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"- So then we're both writing songs for--"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"- These songs always have like the big chorus,"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"or the chorus whenever you finally get to the real chorus."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"It always has some like, you know,"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"it's all coming back to me now, total eclipse."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"We need like a line like that."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- Right."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"- The hallmark of these songs is taking like"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"something pretty normal, like a breakup or something,"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"and truly taking it to like this epic level."
01:47:06;01:47:06;"- Right."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"- To a prog rock level of epic, like."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"- Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:12;"- So like this is total eclipse of the heart,"
01:47:12;01:47:16;"like, you know, some like force of nature type thing."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"- Yeah, you can't do like love earthquake,"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"or like it's hurricane breakup."
01:47:19;01:47:23;"- Clash of the, what's that (beep)"
01:47:23;01:47:26;"like iPhone game they always advertise on TV?"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"Clash of the clans or something?"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- I think that's it, yeah."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"- Clash of clans of the heart."
01:47:32;01:47:35;"Game of Thrones lover, Dragonheart."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"What if Lady Gaga came out with a seven minute"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"prog power ballad called Dragonheart,"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"first single off the next album?"
01:47:42;01:47:43;"- That would be sick."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"- So like maybe something like, maybe Dragonheart."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"- Okay, okay, well both of our songs are called Dragonheart."
01:47:47;01:47:50;"- The final season of Game of Thrones is coming up, so."
01:47:50;01:47:51;"- Oh cool."
01:47:51;01:47:51;"- We know that's coming."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"- But it's like a power ballad, it's not."
01:47:53;01:47:54;"- You gotta think, well it's like one of these."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"- Yeah, yeah, it's not like, Dragonheart, it's like a, yeah."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"- We gotta follow the Jim Steinman model,"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"that's kinda like, you think it's the chorus,"
01:48:00;01:48:01;"it's this really big part."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Dragonheart."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"- Okay, yeah."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- You start, and then in the knock,"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"and then I was in the dark,"
01:48:10;01:48:14;"and then in the dark, my Dragonheart."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"- Wow."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- Oh, I got another idea."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"If it was like a seven minute prog ballad,"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"that's also called like Armageddon,"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"just like some end of the world (beep)."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"That's also (beep) that's very apropos,"
01:48:24;01:48:25;"because the world's ending."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"- In 20 years, right?"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"- Yeah, in 20 years, so everybody knows that, just like."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"- Well we got 20 years left,"
01:48:30;01:48:33;"gonna go get a cup of coffee."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"- Did I tell you that--"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"- I don't want a Chipotle."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"- I think I've told this story on Time Crisis before,"
01:48:36;01:48:39;"that there was a big movie with Bruce Willis"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"in the late 90s called Armageddon."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"- Oh yeah."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"- And there was posters for it everywhere,"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"and I remember there was this kid,"
01:48:46;01:48:47;"my high school told me,"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"man, you know how there's that movie,"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"and there are like posters everywhere,"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"and you kept like reading about it?"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"Until the movie came out,"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"I kept thinking it was called Armageddon."
01:48:55;01:48:58;"It's actually pronounced Armageddon,"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"and I was like, oh yeah, I knew that."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"- Armageddon."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"- And he was like, yeah, I don't know,"
01:49:02;01:49:02;"I thought it was Armageddon."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"And then I saw from his point of view,"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"I'm like-- - That's a sick band name."
01:49:05;01:49:08;"- Armageddon, and I was also kind of thinking,"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"if you're unfamiliar with the word,"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"we also grew up in the 90s,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"everybody's obsessed with dinosaurs."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- Oh yeah. - And if it was a dinosaur,"
01:49:14;01:49:15;"it probably would be pronounced Armageddon,"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"so I'm like, yeah, don't beat yourself up."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"Armageddon."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"But also, this is where my stupid sense of humor,"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"that's probably gonna just (beep) up"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"this whole Lady Gaga deal, kicks in,"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"is that actually--"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"- We're skating on thin ice with this deal."
01:49:28;01:49:32;"- We're skating on thin ice with Gaga."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"Although she's (beep) cool, man, I've always liked her."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"But I was thinking that, you know,"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Dragonheart is one thing,"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"but it would also be kind of tight"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"if it was a seven minute power ballad,"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"spelled Armageddon,"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"but in the song she just keeps saying Armageddon."
01:49:44;01:49:46;"And then there's writing about it,"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"like it's a beautiful song,"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"harkening back to some of the best of Jim Steinman."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"One thing that threw this reviewer was"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"the fact that she pronounces the word Armageddon"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"and it seems, you know,"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"kind of some weird poetic license happening."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"But maybe it's about a dinosaur."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"(laughing)"
