00:05;00:09;"We're joined in the studio by Bardo Martinez from Chicano Batman."
00:09;00:13;"Plus, Seinfeld 2000. That's right, he's back."
00:13;00:19;"We talk about everything in this episode, from my trip to Japan, to Jake's appearance at the Skull and Roses Festival."
00:19;00:25;"All that, plus Sonic the Hedgehog Curry, and the latest Foster the People/Imagine Dragons beef news."
00:25;00:27;"This is..."
00:27;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:30;00:32;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast..."

30:56;30:59;"But yeah, like, you know, it's like if you were a jazz musician"
30:59;31:02;"and you were playing a lot of the songs that Coltrane played"
31:02;31:04;"but you were doing your own thing with it."
31:04;31:06;"You'd probably feel offended if somebody was like,"
31:06;31:08;"""Oh, you're a Coltrane cover jazz band?"""
31:08;31:11;"And you'd be like, ""No, man, we're dipping into their material"
31:11;31:14;"as an improvisatory vehicle."""
31:14;31:15;"Exactly."

31:46;32:04;"We played at 3.30 in the afternoon on Friday,"
32:04;32:06;"which was the opening day of the fest."
32:06;32:08;"Were you the opening act?"
32:08;32:09;"We were the third."
32:09;32:10;"Okay."
32:10;32:14;"The first group was a trio, really nice trio."
32:14;32:17;"A woman was playing harp, and then there was two guys on guitar,"
32:17;32:19;"and they did three-part harmony."
32:19;32:20;"Whoa."
32:20;32:23;"They did Scarlet Begonias, they did Must Have Been the Roses,"
32:23;32:24;"and one other song."
32:24;32:27;"They played for 40 minutes, three songs."
32:27;32:29;"Whoa, so they were just jamming on harp and two acoustics?"
32:29;32:30;"It was tight."
32:30;32:31;"Yeah?"
32:31;32:33;"It was such a gentle, sweet opening."
32:33;32:34;"That sounds amazing."
32:34;32:35;"You remember what they're called?"
32:35;32:36;"[sighs]"
32:36;32:39;"I don't, but I know one of the guys playing guitar"
32:39;32:44;"hosts a well-known dead show up in the Bay Area on the radio."
32:44;32:46;"That sounds like exactly what you want to see at an event like that,"
32:46;32:50;"just be like, ""I've never heard this song performed on these instruments before."""
32:50;32:51;"Yeah, it was great."
32:51;32:53;"We played--it was cool."
32:53;32:56;"I mean, I thought--I was a little worried that there might be no one there"
32:56;32:58;"because it's so early or that they'd still be setting up,"
32:58;33:01;"but this festival was very well run."
33:01;33:05;"So the Ventura County Fairgrounds is just basically a--"
33:05;33:07;"like, I think they race cars there."
33:07;33:11;"It's like where there's a sloped angle and it's an oval-shaped arena."
33:11;33:12;"Yeah."
33:12;33:13;"No seats."
33:13;33:15;"It's just sort of like white concrete walls,"
33:15;33:18;"and then there's just like a big dirt oval."
33:18;33:21;"So everyone's in the middle, and then there's a stage set up on each end."
33:21;33:22;"Oh, there are two stages."
33:22;33:25;"Two stages, so there was no break between bands."
33:25;33:27;"So while the next band was playing, we set up."
33:27;33:29;"Was there any crosstown jamming?"
33:29;33:33;"I mean, like, we were sound checking while the other band was playing."
33:33;33:34;"I mean, and also--"
33:34;33:36;"But the guys were like, ""No one can hear this."
33:36;33:38;"This is just on stage."""
33:38;33:40;"Oh, yeah, Fragile Thunder was the name."
33:40;33:42;"Oh, cool. I'm going to check out Fragile Thunder."
33:42;33:43;"It was that trio."
33:43;33:46;"I noticed in the video that you posted on Instagram,"
33:46;33:48;"the sound was really great."
33:48;33:50;"Yeah, so it was very pro setup."
33:50;33:53;"So the band before us, Wake of the Dead, finished,"
33:53;33:55;"and as soon as they were done,"
33:55;33:57;"the crowd that was watching them turned around,"
33:57;34:01;"walked 200 feet in back of them, and then watched us,"
34:01;34:03;"and we started playing immediately."
34:03;34:06;"It's incredible fans to go to an event like that"
34:06;34:08;"and just be like, ""I love this community."
34:08;34:09;"I love this music so much."
34:09;34:13;"I'm just ready to, like, just tennis match my head back and forth"
34:13;34:15;"between Dead and Tribute X."""
34:15;34:17;"Good crowd, a lot of old hippies."
34:17;34:21;"No, like, younger people who just got hip to the Dead in the last year."
34:21;34:23;"I guess that also kind of reminds you that, you know,"
34:23;34:25;"we've talked on this show about how there is, like,"
34:25;34:30;"a kind of slight fashion element to some of the Dead revival now"
34:30;34:32;"with, you know, just people getting into the T-shirts"
34:32;34:34;"and appreciating the art kind of,"
34:34;34:35;"and some people getting into the music,"
34:35;34:38;"some people getting into Dead & Co via John Mayer, things like that."
34:38;34:42;"But it sounds like Skull & Roses maybe is a bridge too far"
34:42;34:45;"for the casual T-shirt kind of guy."
34:45;34:48;"There were overpriced T-shirts, although mine was only 20."
34:48;34:49;"Mine was a very fair price."
34:49;34:50;"Oh, that's really reasonable."
34:50;34:52;"But yeah, the fan base for the most part was, like,"
34:52;34:55;"we're like old crusties, old hippies."
34:55;34:56;"That's amazing."
34:56;34:59;"I also noticed in that video, from what I could tell,"
34:59;35:03;"it seemed like a kind of overcast, windswept day."
35:03;35:04;"It was."
35:04;35:05;"It was, like, vibey as hell out there."
35:05;35:06;"Very."
35:06;35:08;"At one point, three-quarters of the way through our set,"
35:08;35:10;"the sun broke through."
35:10;35:11;"Oh, wow."
35:11;35:12;"For, like, two minutes."
35:12;35:13;"What song were you on?"
35:13;35:15;"I want to say Viola Lee."
35:15;35:16;"Oh, yeah."
35:16;35:17;"Maybe."
35:17;35:18;"Was it a long Viola Lee?"
35:18;35:20;"Yeah, probably 10."
35:20;35:22;"Opened with Birdsong."
35:22;35:24;"That's a classic RP opener."
35:24;35:26;"Yeah, 10 or 12 minutes."
35:26;35:27;"And then?"
35:27;35:28;"Cream Puff War."
35:28;35:29;"Yeah, that's a classic."
35:29;35:30;"I was on Iceland."
35:30;35:31;"Okay."
35:31;35:32;"Me and John doing two-part harmony the entire time."
35:32;35:33;"Kick up the energy."
35:33;35:34;"Cream Puff."
35:34;35:35;"They Love Each Other."
35:35;35:36;"Sugary."
35:36;35:37;"Loser."
35:37;35:38;"Heavy Hitters."
35:38;35:39;"Viola Lee."
35:39;35:40;"Uh-huh."
35:40;35:41;"Masterpiece."
35:41;35:42;"Great set."
35:42;35:44;"When you told me -- I feel like, actually, no,"
35:44;35:46;"we did talk about this at the time, Chris."
35:46;35:47;"Great set, folks."
35:47;35:49;"Because we were joking about --"
35:49;35:50;"Trump."
35:50;35:52;"It's a great set, folks."
35:52;35:55;"Trump just, like, trying to change the subject,"
35:55;35:59;"just like -- And congrats to Richard Pictures"
35:59;36:01;"at the Skull and Roses Festival."
36:01;36:02;"Great set, folks."
36:02;36:04;"Great set, folks."
36:04;36:07;"We were joking last time when we talked about it,"
36:07;36:09;"when you guys were working out your set,"
36:09;36:11;"we said -- And you told me that the same joke"
36:11;36:12;"came up in practice."
36:12;36:15;"Should you guys just straight-up do a 45-minute"
36:15;36:16;"playing in the band?"
36:16;36:18;"And then you told me that somebody did do that."
36:18;36:22;"Someone played a 59-minute version of playing in the band."
36:22;36:23;"That's a set."
36:23;36:25;"That's the same version of playing in the band."
36:25;36:27;"That's as long as ""Father of the Bride,"""
36:27;36:28;"the new Vampire Weekend album."
36:28;36:29;"Wow."
36:29;36:30;"That probably broke the record"
36:30;36:32;"for the longest ever performed."
36:32;36:33;"I think it did."
36:33;36:35;"They had the Guinness World Book of Records on site"
36:35;36:36;"to confirm."
36:36;36:37;"Oh, yeah."
36:37;36:38;"So that was their whole set."
36:38;36:39;"That was their whole set."
36:39;36:41;"Were they teasing other dead songs in the middle?"
36:41;36:43;"No, they went straight --"
36:43;36:45;"They kind of just went straight fish on it."
36:45;36:46;"Yeah."
36:46;36:48;"Not the highlight for me, personally."
36:48;36:49;"[ Laughter ]"
36:49;36:51;"You got to admire the tenacity."
36:51;36:53;"Absolutely."
36:53;36:56;"I wasn't picturing, like, us doing, like,"
36:56;36:58;"an ESPN-style, like, play-by-play"
36:58;37:00;"of the Skull and Roses Festival."
37:00;37:02;"Just, like, 45 minutes deep"
37:02;37:04;"into that 59-minute playing in the band."
37:04;37:08;"Jake, like, you got to admire the tenacity of these guys."
37:08;37:10;"The focus, the dedication."
37:10;37:11;"We're sitting in, like --"
37:11;37:13;"Now, this takes some practice."
37:13;37:15;"We're sitting in, like, very expensive"
37:15;37:19;"and, like, tightly tailored suits on stools"
37:19;37:23;"in front of the very dusty Ventura County fairgrounds."
37:23;37:26;"It was just, like, minute 40 playing in the band,"
37:26;37:30;"like, kind of wafting in the air above."
37:30;37:31;"Oh, my God."

38:01;38:03;"They did provide food for the band,"
38:03;38:05;"so there was a tent."
38:05;38:06;"Grilled cheese?"
38:06;38:07;"I wish."
38:07;38:09;"A little bit rough."
38:09;38:10;"Oh, no."
38:10;38:11;"A little bit rough."
38:11;38:13;"Rough stuff, folks, at the Ventura County."
38:13;38:14;"A very well-known chain."
38:14;38:16;"This is my first time eating its food."
38:16;38:19;"Oh, this is getting juicy."
38:19;38:20;"Panda Express."
38:20;38:23;"Oh."
38:23;38:27;"Panda Express buffet."
38:27;38:29;"Putting the buff in buffet."
38:29;38:33;"Oh, man."
38:33;38:37;"That's very not kind."
38:37;38:41;"That is a real weird joke."
38:41;38:42;"Bit of a harsh joke."
38:42;38:45;"I hope this doesn't get back to the organizers of Skull and Roses,"
38:45;38:47;"because we want to be invited back."
38:47;38:48;"It was a great festival."
38:48;38:51;"Very, very well run."
38:51;38:53;"The staff was professional."
38:53;38:54;"The buffet is just --"
38:54;38:57;"So it's out in the open, the food is exposed, it's a windy day?"
38:57;38:58;"It was under a tent."
38:58;38:59;"Oh, okay."
38:59;39:00;"All right."
39:00;39:02;"And actually, we played when the food arrived,"
39:02;39:07;"and they were considerate enough to actually set enough Panda Express aside"
39:07;39:11;"for all seven Richard Pictures to eat."
39:11;39:13;"And I was actually starved."
39:13;39:17;"I'd actually, like, downed two beers during our set"
39:17;39:20;"and sort of rolled off stage, like, kind of cold from all the wind."
39:20;39:23;"And a little buzz, and I was like, I need some food, I'm hungry."
39:23;39:25;"And it was like 445."
39:25;39:27;"I had, like, an early lunch."
39:27;39:28;"Yeah."
39:28;39:30;"We get to the tent, Panda."
39:30;39:32;"What did you eat?"
39:32;39:34;"You know, like, noodles, and then there was, like, little --"
39:34;39:38;"I mean, just, like, noodles with brown sauce on it,"
39:38;39:40;"and then there were packets of sriracha, which he needed."
39:40;39:41;"Oh, sriracha."
39:41;39:43;"Have you had Panda?"
39:43;39:44;"I've never had Panda."
39:44;39:45;"Maybe I'm being harsh on it."
39:45;39:48;"I just always -- my impression of Panda Express was always that it was, like,"
39:48;39:53;"a weird, not-Chinese-owned, fake Chinese food chain."
39:53;39:55;"I think that's what it is."
39:55;39:57;"I thought it would be kind of better."
39:57;39:59;"I thought it would be cool, but it was, like, truly --"
39:59;40:02;"like, they went out of their way to make the food bland."
40:02;40:06;"And maybe people want to add soy sauce and sriracha to, like, spice it up."
40:06;40:09;"It's a weird corporate gringo Chinese food."
40:09;40:15;"I would say that Taco Bell is a better analogy to real Mexican food"
40:15;40:18;"than Panda Express is to real Chinese food."
40:18;40:22;"You're saying that Taco Bell actually is truer to the source material?"
40:22;40:25;"Not truer, but you can delight more."
40:25;40:30;"You can find more pleasure in Taco Bell's weird facsimile of Mexican food."
40:30;40:34;"I consider Mexican food to be one of my top five favorite cuisines."
40:34;40:35;"Oh, absolutely."
40:35;40:37;"Like everybody, really."
40:37;40:38;"Yeah."
40:38;40:41;"If I ever met somebody who didn't have Mexican food in their top five,"
40:41;40:44;"I'd just be like, ""What's your [bleep] problem, man?"""
40:44;40:45;"But anyway--"
40:45;40:46;"Top three, let's be honest."
40:46;40:47;"Top two."
40:47;40:50;"Japanese, Mexican, Italian."
40:50;40:51;"Top three, yeah."
40:51;40:53;"Between those three--"
40:53;40:55;"Italian, Mexican, Japanese."
40:55;40:56;"I think those are my three."
40:56;40:59;"Yeah, that's basically it for me, too."
40:59;41:00;"And then burgers."
41:00;41:01;"American."
41:01;41:03;"Yeah, no, anyway, I would say, yeah, just to wrap that,"
41:03;41:06;"just to say Taco Bell is a better facsimile."
41:06;41:08;"I was going to say that I love Mexican food,"
41:08;41:13;"and I love L.A. Mexican food from food trucks to high cuisine--"
41:13;41:15;"To Cow and Eagle Rock, great restaurant."
41:15;41:17;"--to, like, fancy sit-down."
41:17;41:19;"And being in Mexico, I mean, come on."
41:19;41:23;"Actually, Ariel just went to Mexico, and he was telling me about all the amazing food he ate."
41:23;41:24;"I'm sure."
41:24;41:26;"I'm not a foodie, so normally people get back from a trip."
41:26;41:27;"I'm not trying to hear about it."
41:27;41:28;"No."
41:28;41:29;"Mexico City, that used--"
41:29;41:32;"And again, everything from street food to the fancy restaurant, incredible country."
41:32;41:33;"Yeah."
41:33;41:35;"That said, I've always had a soft spot for Taco Bell, too."
41:35;41:37;"There's almost something weirdly complimentary about it."
41:37;41:40;"I guess some people feel that way about, like, Pizza Hut, too."
41:40;41:41;"Sure, sure."
41:41;41:43;"Where somebody would be like, ""Oh, you like that?"
41:43;41:47;"You've never had, like, a real thin crust Neapolitan pizza?"""
41:47;41:49;"And you'd be like, ""Yeah, man, I have. That's good, too."""
41:49;41:50;"Yeah."
41:50;41:52;"It's just so different that you put it in a funny category."
41:52;41:53;"Yeah."
41:53;41:55;"Yeah, but Panda Express, what does that serve?"
41:55;41:59;"I mean, maybe we just have a nostalgic, you know, association with Taco Bell and Pizza Hut"
41:59;42:01;"because we grew up with it."
42:01;42:05;"And maybe there's listeners out there who grew up with Panda Express, and they were"
42:05;42:06;"eating it when they were eight."
42:06;42:09;"It was a real treat to go to the Panda Express, and now they're an adult."
42:09;42:10;"They love it."
42:10;42:13;"They're just hearing these two douchebags ragging on it."
42:13;42:19;"I'm eating Panda Express for the first time at age 42 with kind of a beer buzz, kind of"
42:19;42:20;"cold."
42:20;42:21;"Well, I thought--"
42:21;42:23;"And, you know, I'm looking to, like, recover here."
42:23;42:24;"I just figured--"
42:24;42:27;"Again, all mad love to Skull and Roses."
42:27;42:29;"This is just, like, a funny nitpick."
42:29;42:30;"That's all."
42:30;42:34;"What if it turns out that Panda Express owns Skull and Roses?"
42:34;42:36;"Word gets back."
42:36;42:37;"Well, okay."
42:37;42:40;"We got some serious egg on our face, man."
42:40;42:41;"Uh-oh."
42:41;42:46;"Panda Express was founded by Andrew Cheung, Pandy Cheung, and Andrew's father, Master"
42:46;42:48;"Chef Ming-Tsai Cheung."
42:48;42:53;"Andrew Cheung and his father are from the Yangzhou region of China's Jiangsu province, while"
42:53;42:56;"Peggy was born in Burma and raised in Hong Kong."
42:56;43:01;"And so Peggy, one of the founders, she had worked for several years as a software designer"
43:01;43:04;"and engineer for defense contractors like McDonnell Douglas."
43:04;43:08;"And so because of that, Panda Express computerized its operations early on."
43:08;43:09;"Whoa."
43:09;43:14;"That's something-- Actually, Bayo was telling me this about Domino's, that Domino's Pizza,"
43:14;43:18;"I guess, like, the stock was going through the roof recently because they've invested"
43:18;43:20;"so heavily in the tech side of things."
43:20;43:25;"I guess apparently the things that Domino-- I'm totally making this up now, or I'm paraphrasing--"
43:25;43:30;"that Domino's has developed this really sophisticated software so that they can deliver the pizzas"
43:30;43:35;"more quickly, including driverless cars with ovens in the back and all sorts of crazy stuff."
43:35;43:36;"No way."
43:36;43:37;"I've seen those."
43:38;43:39;"What?"
43:39;43:40;"They're getting crazy with it."
43:40;43:41;"That seems cost prohibitive."
43:41;43:46;"And I guess they're developing such sophisticated software, perhaps robotics, AI-type stuff,"
43:46;43:52;"that pretty soon they're being looked at as a tech company, almost more than a pizza chain."
43:52;43:55;"And meanwhile, you got Papa John's."
43:55;43:56;"Total disgrace."
43:56;43:57;"They're a mess."
43:57;43:58;"You got pizza."
43:58;44:02;"And they're just like, ""Well, we're just trying to figure out ways to spice up our pizza and"
44:02;44:03;"have fun."""
44:03;44:07;"And they're like-- And meanwhile, Domino's is going to be pretty soon selling software"
44:07;44:08;"to the CIA."
44:08;44:10;"They got that pizza tracker."
44:10;44:14;"You can follow your pizza order every step of the way."
44:14;44:15;"Well, that's pretty basic."
44:15;44:18;"That's just kind of like GPS, like, where's your driver?"
44:18;44:23;"Domino's Pizza has been named the most innovative restaurant company in tech and honored with"
44:23;44:25;"the 2018 Tech Accelerator of the Year Award."
44:25;44:27;"Get some details out of that article."
44:27;44:30;"That's the concept of accelerationism."
44:30;44:33;"I'm not buying this oven in the back of a driverless car."
44:33;44:35;"That is truly insane."
44:35;44:36;"That is, like, insane."
44:36;44:40;"You know those scary videos that go viral every six months?"
44:40;44:46;"The Boston Robotics Company, where they have a weird robot antelope that's running around"
44:46;44:48;"in a parking lot."
44:48;44:52;"That's running around in a parking lot in Massachusetts, and there's some weird dude"
44:52;44:53;"kicks it."
44:53;44:54;"You know how you've seen these videos?"
44:54;44:55;"I haven't seen that."
44:55;44:57;"But you know Boston Robotics, right?"
44:57;44:58;"Actually, I don't."
44:58;44:59;"Wait, Seinfeld, you know what I'm talking about, right?"
44:59;45:00;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
45:00;45:02;"They can open doors and open doors for the--"
45:02;45:05;"And it's always really freaky, and they're always based on animals."
45:05;45:08;"So it's like some weird robot dog running outside."
45:08;45:09;"Robot dog?"
45:09;45:10;"In Worcester, Mass."
45:10;45:13;"And then some dude dropkicks it."
45:13;45:14;"It jumps."
45:14;45:16;"Anyway, Boston Robotics makes creepy robots."
45:16;45:21;"And anyway, I'm just picturing that soon they collab with Domino's, and it's a galloping"
45:21;45:24;"robot donkey, and the body of it's an oven."
45:24;45:29;"And it comes to the door and comes up and rings the doorbell and then turns around."
45:29;45:32;"And you take-- the pizza's not even in a box."
45:32;45:34;"And then it murders your family."
45:34;45:36;"That's what's going to happen."
45:36;45:39;"[MUSIC - BOSTON ROBOTS, ""EVOLUTION""]"
45:40;45:40;"Woo!"
45:40;45:45;"I'm a head."
45:45;45:47;"I'm a man."
45:47;45:50;"I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah."
45:50;45:54;"I'm at peace with my lust."
45:54;45:58;"I can kill 'cause I got a chance, yeah."
45:58;46:00;"It's evolution, baby."
46:07;46:09;"I'm a beast."
46:09;46:11;"I'm the man."
46:11;46:14;"How it starts on the day of the crash, yeah."
46:14;46:16;"I'm the lunch."
46:16;46:18;"I'm the churn."
46:18;46:22;"All around and here to flatten the mound, yeah."
46:22;46:24;"It's weird behavior."
46:24;46:31;"It's evolution, baby."
46:35;46:38;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
46:38;46:41;"That is so lame."
46:41;46:45;"Domino's getting a tech award?"
46:45;46:50;"So the pizza's going to get there like three minutes faster than it would have ordinarily?"
46:50;46:52;"What an insane waste of resources."
46:52;46:54;"This article doesn't-- wait, let's see."
46:54;46:56;"Of late, the chain has gained attention."
46:56;46:57;"Also, it's Domino's."
46:57;47:00;"Like, they're putting so much energy and investment into this technology--"
47:00;47:01;"Oh, this is hilarious."
47:01;47:03;"--to deliver the same crappy pizza."
47:03;47:12;"It's like somebody's on record at Domino's as saying that they consider themselves a tech company that happens to serve food."
47:12;47:13;"Oh my god, dude."
47:13;47:15;"Maybe that's the same as Panda Express."
47:15;47:20;"We consider ourselves a defense contractor that happens to serve Chinese food."
47:20;47:22;"Wait, what was the rest of the Panda story?"
47:22;47:24;"Okay, we'll circle back."
47:24;47:30;"Of late, Domino's has gained attention for tech-driven initiatives such as its expanded test of self-driving cars in Miami,"
47:30;47:37;"as well as its Hot Spots delivery service, which allows customers to order pizza for delivery to park stadiums and other shared locations that do not have a physical
address."
47:37;47:39;"Oh, that's cool. That makes sense."
47:39;47:40;"You know, funny story."
47:40;47:43;"I was recently at the supermarket Arowan."
47:43;47:52;"And for people who don't know, Arowan is a very kind of bougie, expensive, health-food-oriented LA supermarket."
47:52;47:54;"A couple locations on the west side."
47:54;47:55;"A bunch of locations."
47:55;47:57;"Nothing on the east side."
47:57;47:58;"Yeah, not yet."
47:58;47:59;"There will be one eventually--"
47:59;48:00;"You're probably right."
48:00;48:01;"--in Silver Lake."
48:01;48:02;"Highland Park."
48:02;48:03;"In Highland Park, and it'll be a game changer."
48:03;48:13;"But Arowan is famous in LA because it's like the epitome of what you'd imagine a crazy, fancy LA place would be with $20 juices and stuff."
48:13;48:14;"Yeah."
48:14;48:18;"It makes Whole Foods look like Safeway is probably the best way to describe it."
48:18;48:19;"Damn, I've never--"
48:19;48:20;"You've never been to one?"
48:20;48:22;"No, I've never stepped foot in one."
48:22;48:25;"It's very rich hippie. It's a very rich hippie vibe."
48:25;48:26;"But can you taste the difference?"
48:26;48:28;"If you get the $14--"
48:28;48:30;"I've never had one of the really expensive--"
48:30;48:31;"I don't know."
48:31;48:34;"--juices, but I mean, I definitely see ingredients there that you don't see everywhere."
48:34;48:35;"Okay."
48:35;48:38;"Bee pollen, collagen, smooth-- I don't know."
48:38;48:39;"Yeah, yeah."
48:39;48:42;"So for all I know, those are very good things for your body."
48:42;48:44;"But anyway, I was there."
48:44;48:45;"So you can picture what the vibe is."
48:45;48:46;"Yeah."
48:46;48:47;"And I see this dude."
48:47;48:55;"It freaked me out just for a second, you know, where I just saw kind of like an older dude in cargo shorts holding a bunch of KFC."
48:55;49:01;"Like two bags. And he had like a very weird look on his face because he was like so freaked out."
49:01;49:03;"And I was just like, ""What's this guy's deal?"""
49:03;49:04;"You know?"
49:04;49:05;"Yeah."
49:05;49:07;"He looked like a 55-year-old, could have been like ex-military."
49:07;49:10;"I was just like, ""Okay, man. What's going on? Are you upset?"""
49:10;49:15;"And I see him talking to the sushi guy at the sushi pavilion."
49:15;49:18;"And I'm just like, ""Is this a confrontation?"""
49:18;49:20;"Is the KFC wafting through the store?"
49:20;49:24;"My sense of smell is not good, but probably."
49:24;49:27;"And then I see eventually the sushi guy points at him."
49:27;49:29;"I must have come in right at the beginning of this interaction."
49:29;49:33;"And they weren't raising their voices, but they were like intense-looking faces."
49:33;49:34;"And then the sushi guy just points."
49:34;49:39;"And then I see the guy go, and he was just delivering some KFC to somebody who worked there."
49:39;49:40;"And just like walked right in the front door."
49:40;49:42;"And I think he ended up handing it over."
49:42;49:44;"And I was like, ""That's sick. I love that."""
49:44;49:49;"Just all these people waiting in line, buying this insanely overpriced health food."
49:49;49:53;"And then just somebody else just like, ""Yep. KFC. That's for me."""
49:53;49:55;"People in the back making the food."
49:55;49:56;"They're eating KFC."
49:56;49:58;"Well, and it's also a classic thing in your mind."
49:58;50:02;"I mean, I hope that that place is kind of vibing enough that they're paying people a good wage"
50:02;50:04;"and giving them a nice employee discount."
50:04;50:05;"I know. I hope so."
50:05;50:07;"I would think so."
50:07;50:12;"If you're ordering KFC from Postmates, you got at least a little extra cash."
50:12;50:13;"So maybe they just want a KFC."
50:13;50:14;"I bet it was for a lot of people."
50:14;50:15;"Yeah."
50:15;50:18;"I bet it was for like four or five dudes went in on some KFC."
50:18;50:20;"Get two buckets."
50:20;50:22;"[laughs]"
50:22;50:24;"Fast food via Postmates seems kind of weird."
50:24;50:26;"I think it's big, though."
50:26;50:31;"I feel like fast food has a very short shelf life once it leaves the store."
50:31;50:34;"Like certainly French fries, terrible."
50:34;50:35;"Within five minutes."
50:35;50:42;"McDonald's Japan has McDelivery, and they have like an oven type of or some sort of high-tech warming thing."
50:42;50:46;"And yeah, it keeps it--it's almost like you went to McDonald's."
50:46;50:47;"Oh, did you have it delivered?"
50:47;50:49;"I had it delivered a couple times, yeah."
50:49;50:53;"So they have some sort of like heat lamp like on some sort of motorized--"
50:53;50:55;"Similar to the Domino's robot."
50:55;50:57;"We got a lot of tabs open right now, folks."
50:57;50:59;"[laughs]"
50:59;51:01;"So back to Panda Express."
51:01;51:03;"Another one of these forward-thinking companies."
51:03;51:06;"So I guess first of all, we got to apologize to Panda Express."
51:06;51:11;"We assumed incorrectly that you were a Taco Bell type situation,"
51:11;51:15;"but the company was founded by people of Chinese descent."
51:15;51:22;"I guess Panda Express does kind of have a reputation like you picture a non-Chinese person wolfing that down"
51:22;51:24;"just being like, ""Great Chinese food."""
51:24;51:25;"Right."
51:25;51:27;"But OK, clearly there's something more complicated going on."
51:27;51:28;"We'll have to do some research."
51:28;51:31;"Well, like Taco Bell is sort of a joke in our culture."
51:31;51:37;"Like there's all those like Neil Hamburger retweets of people getting on Twitter talking about getting sick from Taco Bell."
51:37;51:39;"And it's like a punchline."
51:39;51:43;"But Panda Express somehow has maintained itself above the fray."
51:43;51:46;"And I'm here to tell you, folks, that's not deserved."
51:46;51:47;"OK, it's not that--"
51:47;51:51;"I didn't get sick, but it's like very innocuous."
51:51;51:52;"OK, well, how about this, Jake?"
51:52;51:55;"Is it possible that Panda Express just doesn't travel that well?"
51:55;52:01;"Well, I was going to say Chinese food of all of the sort of like fast foods that you could get would probably travel the best."
52:01;52:02;"It's known to travel well."
52:02;52:04;"But maybe there's something about Panda Express."
52:04;52:06;"Maybe Panda Express would actually say to you,"
52:06;52:12;"""OK, man, I'm sure, you know, whatever Chinese restaurant your family was ordering from growing up in Connecticut,"
52:12;52:14;"yeah, that traveled well."""
52:14;52:20;"There's a reason for that because, you know, they were loading it up with the kind of junk that we don't put in our food."
52:20;52:26;"If you want the real Panda Express experience, if you want to judge us and talk about us on your Internet radio show,"
52:26;52:30;"don't wolf it down to beers, deep backstage at Skull and Roses."
52:30;52:33;"Come down to the Panda Express test kitchen."
52:33;52:34;"Where's that, Pasadena?"
52:34;52:35;"Oh, yeah."
52:35;52:37;"Eat it fresh in the--"
52:37;52:38;"Fresh hot plate."
52:38;52:43;"Fresh hot plate in the atmosphere that the Panda Express founders intended."
52:43;52:47;"And then if you still don't like it, OK, you can go run your mouth."
52:47;52:48;"But until then--"
52:48;52:51;"Show us some goddamn respect."
52:51;52:52;"Yeah."
52:52;52:53;"I'ma bring it to you like this."
52:53;52:56;"Drop a three pointer from the corner like Swish."
52:56;52:59;"Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap."
52:59;53:02;"Shelf top snoop in space invaders cap."
53:02;53:04;"Old school like bread and gravy."
53:04;53:07;"Me and my team roll together like Fred and Grady."
53:07;53:11;"Ain't nothing you can say to stop this mad man."
53:11;53:14;"Play Defenders and the P and Miss Pac-Man."
53:14;53:16;"Just like my Alufa, I had a dream."
53:16;53:19;"In the house with no heat, just kerosene."
53:19;53:22;"Call Bismarck so you get the better connection."
53:22;53:25;"That had the weird tips for a weather reception."
53:25;53:27;"I'm so smart, I even got a GED."
53:27;53:30;"Block the video, BET and MTV."
53:30;53:33;"I'm the best thing out there, go ask your mom."
53:33;53:36;"Spending money on car just to pass the time."
53:36;53:40;"Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good."
53:40;53:42;"Egg, yum."
53:42;53:46;"Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good."
53:46;53:47;"Fried rice."
53:47;53:51;"Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good."
53:51;53:53;"Vegetable, vegetable, rice."
53:53;53:57;"I need a couple of egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good."
53:57;53:58;"That's that."
53:59;54:01;"Well, now I really want to try Panda Express."
54:01;54:02;"I'd go back."
54:02;54:04;"They got that orange chicken."
54:04;54:05;"That's pretty good."
54:05;54:07;"I love orange chicken, generally speaking."
54:07;54:08;"Yeah, it's a great dish."
54:08;54:09;"Who doesn't?"
54:09;54:10;"They didn't have that there."
54:10;54:13;"There was a rice dish, like a fried rice, okay?"
54:13;54:16;"With bits of egg and onion and stuff in it."
54:16;54:17;"Sounds good."
54:17;54:21;"And then there was a noodle dish, which I went a little heavier on."
54:21;54:26;"And then there was a dish of just very soggy looking,"
54:26;54:30;"room temperature chicken and broccoli."
54:30;54:39;"And then there was a dish of very college cafeteria style beef with broccoli."
54:39;54:40;"I'll tell you that."
54:40;54:42;"And it just was like, this is not inspiring."
54:42;54:43;"I'll tell you that."
54:43;54:47;"I've had great Chinese food from the cheapest, at least in the New York area,"
54:47;54:49;"where there's so many Chinese restaurants."
54:49;54:53;"I've had amazing Chinese food going from a dirt cheap hole in the wall"
54:53;54:55;"to a more expensive sit down place."
54:55;54:56;"I like it all."
54:56;54:59;"But I will say one thing, and this might be the gringo thing."
54:59;55:02;"Every experience I've ever had in a cafeteria situation,"
55:02;55:06;"when they have Chinese food that day, there's always something off about it."
55:06;55:11;"Aramark Chinese, whatever, these giant catering companies that might do like a college."
55:11;55:14;"Visiting some-- I'm just like, that's not authentic."
55:14;55:18;"Now I'm actually curious about-- because I feel like there wasn't a lot of Panda Express"
55:18;55:20;"on the East Coast growing up."
55:20;55:21;"Is that true, Jake?"
55:21;55:22;"I will confirm that."
55:22;55:23;"It felt like a West Coast thing."
55:23;55:25;"It was founded in Pasadena."
55:25;55:27;"Oh, and that's where the test kitchen is."
55:27;55:28;"Really?"
55:28;55:30;"Yeah, I guess it started popping--"
55:30;55:33;"Okay, they had a Chinese restaurant called the Panda Inn."
55:33;55:34;"In Pasadena."
55:34;55:38;"Yeah, and then the real estate company that owned the Glendale Galleria,"
55:38;55:41;"which is one of those famous LA 80s malls,"
55:41;55:44;"invited them to develop a fast food version of Panda Inn"
55:44;55:47;"for the Galleria's food court, and Panda Express was launched that October."
55:47;55:48;"Oh, so that's interesting."
55:48;55:49;"So that's '83."
55:49;55:53;"That's interesting too because we just assume Panda Express is the thing,"
55:53;55:57;"but Panda Express is the express version of an original place called the Panda Inn."
55:57;55:59;"Then they opened one at the Westside Pavilion."
55:59;56:02;"Then they got that VC funding."
56:02;56:04;"Okay, this is kind of crazy."
56:04;56:07;"So Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original"
56:07;56:13;"Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987."
56:13;56:15;"What? That's a recent dish?"
56:15;56:19;"Wait, so you're telling me that orange chicken didn't exist before 1987?"
56:19;56:21;"I find that hard to believe."
56:21;56:23;"Maybe just the Panda version didn't exist."
56:23;56:24;"No, that's not what we're getting at."
56:24;56:25;"Read that he invented orange chicken."
56:25;56:28;"Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original"
56:28;56:30;"Chinese-American orange chicken recipe."
56:30;56:32;"That implies he invented orange chicken."
56:32;56:34;"Audacious claim."
56:34;56:39;"So for all those years, nobody thought to combine orange and chicken before this guy?"
56:39;56:41;"Well, because there's already General Tso's chicken."
56:41;56:43;"I have trouble believing that."
56:43;56:48;"Okay, so the Panda Express test kitchen is actually called the Panda Innovation Kitchen,"
56:48;56:52;"and the daughter of the founders, Andrea Churn, overlooks the majority of the--"
56:52;56:55;"Okay, so this is a Chinese-American family business."
56:55;57:03;"In December 2017, Panda Express opened its 2,000th location, and guess where it was?"
57:03;57:04;"In the U.S.?"
57:04;57:05;"Yeah."
57:05;57:09;"A place with residence for TC? Ventura?"
57:09;57:10;"It was in New York City."
57:10;57:11;"Oh, Times Square."
57:11;57:13;"Up by Columbia University."
57:13;57:14;"Oh, man."
57:14;57:16;"We got any Columbia students listening?"
57:16;57:18;"What's the scene like at that Panda Express up there?"
57:18;57:19;"Hoppin'."
57:19;57:25;"Oh, and also, wow, some drama just last month, February 2019, or two months ago."
57:25;57:32;"Panda Express ended its agreement with Pepsi and went full Coca-Cola at all company-owned locations in the U.S."
57:32;57:36;"Can you imagine the phone calls after Pepsi lost the contract?"
57:36;57:38;"Boy, did you f--- this one up, Harry."
57:38;57:42;"And then the flip side, the phone calls around the Coke organization."
57:42;57:43;"Oh, man."
57:43;57:44;"We got the Panda account."
57:44;57:46;"Just getting f---ing wasted."
57:46;57:52;"Okay, so clearly there's a lot we don't-- so I'm curious, any TC heads, let us know your experiences with Panda Kitchen,"
57:52;57:58;"whatever your background and how it intersects with your idea of how Chinese food is supposed to be."
57:58;58:02;"Is it just like a Taco Bell? Is it a pleasant addition to the Chinese food canon?"
58:02;58:09;"You let us know, and we will do a revisit of Panda Express in seven to eight months."

59:56;01:00:02;"We got quite a few people letting us know about this via the various social media platforms."
01:00:03;01:00:08;"I remember we talked a while ago about how Dan from Imagine Dragons posted a heartfelt note"
01:00:08;01:00:14;"about how he was just so bummed all these musicians talking s*** about him and Imagine Dragons."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"He's just like, ""I get it, guys. You don't like us."""
01:00:16;01:00:20;"And I feel for him, and I could easily put myself in his shoes,"
01:00:20;01:00:26;"and some of the various people who had talked s*** about him included The 1975 and Foster the People."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"And we talked about maybe they owed him an apology."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"I don't know if he was listening, but Mark Foster from Foster the People"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"did post an apology to Dan from Imagine Dragons."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"That had to be the TC bump."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"I think it might have been the TC bump."
01:00:40;01:00:45;"I think a lot of TC heads, you know, we love our TC heads, but we cannot control them."
01:00:45;01:00:49;"I think a lot of them were accosting him on the street."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"Holding up signs at concerts."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Apologize now."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"All right, so here's what Dan Reynolds said."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"And, sorry, Mark, uh, what's his name?"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Mark Foster."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Mark Foster. Oh, Mark Foster the People."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Okay."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"""An open apology to Dan Reynolds. I have been burdened by something that I feel I need to amend."
01:01:10;01:01:14;"I would like to apologize to Dan Reynolds and his band, Imagination Dragons."
01:01:14;01:01:20;"In a passing moment last year, I let some words come out of my mouth that don't reflect who I am or what I stand for."
01:01:20;01:01:27;"When Dan posted his open letter speaking from the heart about how the negative words from other artists have affected him,"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"it convicted me."""
01:01:28;01:01:30;"He's right."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"What?"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Sorry, it convicted me. Interesting."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"Convicted, not convinced."
01:01:36;01:01:40;"""As people with platforms, there comes a responsibility to lead by example."
01:01:40;01:01:44;"I truly believe that if artists are supportive of each other and stood together, united,"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"that we can be a positive healing force in the world."
01:01:47;01:01:51;"Everything that I have read about what Dan has been doing as a humanitarian is moving."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"I believe he's one of the good guys."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"It takes a lot of courage to stand for something."

01:02:45;01:02:49;"Much respect to you and your continued success in your music."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"Peace and love, Mark Foster."""
01:02:51;01:02:55;"Well I wish Steve Miller would take a page out of his notebook."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Ha!"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Okay, well, yeah, good for him."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"That was an intense note."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"But you know, these are intense emotions we're talking about here."
01:03:03;01:03:08;"I just, it really is such a 20 teens moment though to have that happen."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Yeah."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"Like picture that during any other era of rock and roll."
01:03:12;01:03:19;"Like, imagine like Noel Gallagher writing that to like Blur or any number of funny..."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"Imagine like Lou Reed's."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"It's just so funny."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"Well, the story is not over because Dan actually did accept the apology."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Oh!"
01:03:28;01:03:32;"Writing in the Notes app, in kind with Mark, because they both use the Notes app,"
01:03:32;01:03:36;"which is the standard for internet apologies."
01:03:36;01:03:40;"Dan replies, you know, briefly, but he says, ""This means quite a lot to me."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"I was probably being overly sensitive to begin with, to be honest."
01:03:43;01:03:48;"I have always loved FTP, that's short for Foster the People's Music,"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"but I continue to jam to it and try to have less hurt feelings over people's opinions."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"Nothing but love and support to you and the guys."""
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Assuming he means the guys in Foster the People."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"""You didn't have to put together something classy like this, but it's rad you did."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Come over here and sit next to me."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Doo doo doo."""
01:04:05;01:04:07;"I guess that's a reference to..."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Is that a song?"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"It must be a Foster the People."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"I think that's maybe a Foster song."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"""Come over here and sit next to me."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Doo doo doo."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Classic."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Classic FTP."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Well, I'm glad it all worked out."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"I thought there was an outside chance that Dan might open up that Notes app and write,"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"""Hey Mark, God forgives."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"I don't."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Your music sucks anyway."""
01:04:32;01:04:34;"And people say, ""We suck."""
01:04:34;01:04:36;"No, but that's cool."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"I'm glad they worked it out."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"But there's also something funny about these public apologies,"
01:04:41;01:04:47;"where it's also like, ""Please tell me you guys also had at least a behind-the-scenes interaction as well."""
01:04:47;01:04:48;"But that's good."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"First of all, shout out to Mark, because that's big of him."
01:04:51;01:04:56;"Because as far as I've heard, he's the only ID hater who took some responsibility."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"But in a way, I hope there was back-channel stuff,"
01:04:59;01:05:04;"because it would be more powerful if he apologized just privately and made no public statement."
01:05:04;01:05:08;"There's a part of it that kind of reads as pandering to me."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Right."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Well, and also, I've got to say, it's tough with the critics,"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"because I've been doing all this press lately for the album,"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"and I've been talking to a lot of music journalists,"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"and a lot of times they'll ask questions."
01:05:20;01:05:24;"I've never had a journalist actually be like, ""Hey, I've got a problem with Van Pergen."""
01:05:24;01:05:27;"But people often be like, ""So, you know, some people have said these kind of things."""
01:05:27;01:05:30;"So you have to answer a lot of questions about criticism."
01:05:30;01:05:34;"It's interesting doing these interviews, as you answer the same question over and over again,"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"you actually start to sometimes..."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"I mean, the sad part is, you say nonsense the first four times,"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"and maybe the fifth time, you actually start to have a good answer."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"And I love about it that I... because I almost became a music critic myself."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"That's right. You wrote some reviews."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"I wrote one review of Dirty Projectors."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"First album."
01:05:52;01:05:56;"I was in college, and I knew I liked music, and I didn't know what form that might take."
01:05:56;01:06:00;"And I saw something where it was like, ""Oh, do you want to write for this website, Dusted?"""
01:06:00;01:06:02;"And I emailed, I was like, ""Yeah, I'd like to write."""
01:06:02;01:06:06;"And they were like, ""Well, write a sample review of something that you've heard recently."""
01:06:06;01:06:09;"And this was before I knew Dave, so I'd just heard Dirty Projectors."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Glad fact."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"And I got a very positive review."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"And I remember they edited it a bit, and I'm sure they made it better,"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"but they also changed it, and I just felt weird about it."
01:06:20;01:06:23;"And then they sent me a stack of CDs after, like, ""All right, cool. You want to keep reviewing?"""
01:06:23;01:06:25;"And then I just listened to a bunch of CDs, and I was like, ""Ah."""
01:06:25;01:06:27;"And again, I'm not saying because I was above it,"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"just because I just realized that my love of writing about music"
01:06:31;01:06:36;"wasn't strong enough to dip into things I didn't really care about."
01:06:36;01:06:39;"So basically what I'm saying is, that part of the note,"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"when he has to create the shared enemy of the critic,"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"there's a part of that that's no disrespect."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"That's a little low-hanging fruit, too, where it's kind of like,"
01:06:47;01:06:52;"""Of course, I've had all sorts of critics say stuff that I thought was whack or uncool"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"or not true or whatever."""
01:06:54;01:06:57;"But at the end of the day, this is basically what my answer became"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"to all these people asking me questions about this and that."
01:07:00;01:07:04;"I don't draw a line between music critics and artists."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"What we do is the same thing."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"They're both forms of cultural analysis."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"So rather than say what we do is somehow more special"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"and what you do is just criticism,"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"because when I really am honest, my whole vision of how I think about music"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"was deeply shaped by music writing."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"Like anybody."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"I had subscriptions to various music magazines."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"I was very interested in the way people--"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I didn't always agree, but I was interested in seeing"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"the way people would frame things."
01:07:29;01:07:33;"And even now, there's occasion where I'll see some publication,"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"I'll be like, ""Man, I don't know about that publication."""
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Then I'll see, ""They have some great writers."""
01:07:38;01:07:40;"So anyway, my latest kind of vibe thought was like,"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"""We're all in the same gang."""
01:07:42;01:07:44;"We're all just interested in looking at the world"
01:07:44;01:07:48;"and looking at the world of music and making an analysis."
01:07:48;01:07:51;"And you could make an analysis by writing about somebody else's music."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"When I think about the way that we talk in the studio,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"it's definitely harsh."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"All we talk about in the studio is, ""That rules. That sucks."""
01:07:58;01:08:00;"I choose not to say it publicly,"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"as people who listen to Time Crisis might be aware,"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"just because I don't want to end up in a situation"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"like the FTPID beef."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"But I do kind of feel like, you know,"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"if you really want to extend that moment of self-reflection"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"and that moment of compassionate humanism,"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"you don't got to rag on the critic either."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"Because even the critic, man, is like--"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"- A sensitive soul, man. - A sensitive soul."
01:08:25;01:08:28;"There is a Clement Greenberg statue in Madison Square Park."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"(laughter)"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"Right next to the Robert Christoffel statue."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"Clement Greenberg was really harsh, wasn't he?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"He was a 20th century New York art critic."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Yeah. But he-- I mean, speaking of critics"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"that really shaped the discourse"
01:08:42;01:08:46;"and arguably the entire trajectory of modern art,"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"he's right there on the same level as kind of any artist."
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Right. It's really easy to look at the dichotomy"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"of artist versus critic and be like,"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"""They're just a hater. They're a failed artist."""
01:08:56;01:09:00;"Because, look, there are critics who are maybe failed artists."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"There's probably musicians who probably couldn't"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"write good criticism if they tried."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"So, you know, it's a two-way street."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"But then there's some other cultural figures"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"who I guess are in between, like a philosopher"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"or like an academic."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I don't know, you think like an Edward Said"
01:09:14;01:09:17;"or like Jean-Paul Sartre."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Because when you get into these kind of"
01:09:19;01:09:23;"public intellectual types, these people write criticism"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"and also create original works."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"And actually some of these people,"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"if you go back to like a-- I hate trying to say it--"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"like a philosopher, like Sartre,"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"that's somebody who would have written works of fiction,"
01:09:35;01:09:38;"criticism, and then general pieces of philosophy,"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"cultural critique, analyses, whatever."
01:09:41;01:09:57;"[singing]"
01:09:58;01:10:11;"""But here I go again. Well, here I go again."
01:10:11;01:10:21;"Here I go again."
01:10:22;01:10:35;"Well, here I go again. Well, here I go again."
01:10:35;01:10:43;"Here I go again."""
01:10:43;01:10:46;"Anyway, how about a little bit of Sonic Curry?"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Boom. Okay."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"So we're opening the rice."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"- This is Japan. I'm impressed. - That's right."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"- Microwaved rice. - Wait, do we need a scissor?"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"How do you open this?"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"- I don't want to tear the box. - Oh, here it comes."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"- Oh, boy. - Smells like curry."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"- Oh, that is very blue."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"That's like a Gatorade blue."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"- Oh, yeah. That's a deep, rich, synthetic blue."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"What are those chunks of something in there?"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"You think it's meat? - Gross."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"- How did you-- - Damn, dude."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- How do you rip it this way? - It does look like antifreeze"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"or something. - Oh, yeah."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"- I've got to be ready for my first bite."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"- I hate the coloring."
01:11:23;01:11:26;"- Bro, the whole point is the coloring."
01:11:26;01:11:28;"- Oh, it's the hedgehog. - Yeah, Sonic."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"- I don't even know who that is."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"I've heard the name Sonic the Hedgehog, but--"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"- You're kidding. What do you mean you don't--"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"You never played the game? - No."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"I don't like cartoons, and I don't like video games."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"So I'm just-- I'm out."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"- But you like art. You like visual art."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"- It's true. - It's not bad."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"- That tastes like a good, cheap, store-bought Japanese curry."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"- Yeah, like if it wasn't blue, it would be--"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"- Honestly, I-- where'd you get this?"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"I don't f--- with it. - Amazon Japan."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"- Oh, okay, Amazon. - So you didn't have friends"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"who were playing Sega Genesis growing up?"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"- Oh, we covered this. Lonnie."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"(laughter)"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"- Here we go."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"(laughter)"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"- Lonnie at Nintendo. - Yeah."
01:12:09;01:12:12;"- Well, Jake, you're being a real hater about video games."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"- Sorry. - Actually, I forget"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"what the dude's name is. His last name, I believe,"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"is Aizen Suzuki. He's a great Japanese artist"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"who makes these, like, beautiful kind of comic book-esque"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"drawings/paintings, and he's-- famously was a huge influence"
01:12:27;01:12:30;"on the art of Sonic the Hedgehog. - Okay."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"- I think you'd really like his work, actually."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"He's a Japanese dude. I bought one of his books recently"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"from Japan. I'm still waiting on it to come."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"- Tight. - I've actually been playing"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"Sonic more lately. - Just solo, playing the game?"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"- Just dolo. Just doing some dolo Sonic,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"because remember how-- - What's dolo?"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"- It means solo. - Oh."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"(laughter)"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Wait, is that for real? - Yeah, it's like some '90s"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"hip-hop. - Dolo?"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"- Yeah, I feel like when Q-Tip say dolo."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"- Yeah, like Mobb Deep, I think, would say dolo."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- Am I using it correctly? - Yeah."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"- Is dolo mean by yourself? - Yeah, I think it's solo."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"♪ All by myself ♪"
01:13:06;01:13:10;"- I've been playing Sonic Get This on my Nintendo Switch."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"(gasps) You're listening to Time Crisis Tech Talk,"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"which is covering everything from the dark web"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"to the latest video game consoles."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"So check this out, Jake. You might have been checked out"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"at this point, but for my generation,"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"my slightly younger generation, the '90s were all about"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"Nintendo versus Sega. I read a fairly big non-fiction book"
01:13:29;01:13:32;"about it called Console Wars that apparently"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"Seth Rogen optioned. - That sounds cool, actually."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"- So keep your eyes peeled. Oh, actually, you'd love"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"this book, Jake, because the dude who basically took over"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"Sega and helped-- 'cause imagine Nintendo had"
01:13:43;01:13:47;"essentially 99% market share in the US at the end of the '80s,"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"and then Sega's this kind of upstart company."
01:13:49;01:13:53;"Who do they hire? The former dude who ran Mattel Toys,"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"the guy who developed He-Man. Didn't particularly know"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"anything about video games, but he knew about marketing"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"to impressionable American children."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- Wow. - They positioned Sega"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"as being the kind of more badass console."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"Sonic was fast. Mario was like a dweeb."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"- Wow. - Now that Sega doesn't really"
01:14:11;01:14:14;"have a role in America, it is pretty wild that on the Nintendo Switch"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"you can download this collection of old Sega games."
01:14:18;01:14:23;"So for somebody my age to be just lying on the sofa"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"playing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on a Nintendo device,"
01:14:26;01:14:30;"I can't quite convey to you the level of cognitive dissonance."
01:14:30;01:14:35;"- It'd be like going to McDonald's and ordering a Taco Bell dish."
01:14:35;01:14:39;"- A Whopper. - Oh, even closer to home."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"- Even closer. It'd be like ordering a Whopper."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"- Wow. - Just imagine you got ripped"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"- So did Sega go ahead and win this? - Well, no."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"They just stopped making consoles."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"- So Nintendo bought the rights to those games?"
01:14:51;01:14:55;"- Probably the same way that if you told somebody at Microsoft"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"that one day you'd be downloading a Microsoft app"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"onto your Apple phone. - Hmm."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"- Well, I guess there's always been versions of that, actually."
01:15:01;01:15:05;"But it's like that. I think now that Switch is a much bigger platform"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"and also owns the store, Sega's probably like,"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"""F*** it. We can sell some games."" - Yeah."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"- It's cool."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"- You're listening to..."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Time Crisis"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"on Beats 1."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"- Man, that was some good Sonic Curry."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"- Very blue. - Very blue."
01:16:33;01:16:37;"We are now joined in the studio by Bardo Martinez from Chicano Batman."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"How's it going, man? - Good, good. How are you?"
01:16:39;01:16:42;"- Good. Good to finally meet you. - Same here, brother."
01:16:42;01:16:45;"- We're gonna be going on tour together soon. - That's right."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- Definitely in the... well, kind of all over the place."
01:16:48;01:16:51;"A lot in the Midwest. - Yeah. I think."
01:16:51;01:16:55;"- Yeah. Well, I know that it's hard to keep track of all this touring."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Like, at some point, you just kind of got to go with the flow."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"- We just got our heads in a record that we're making, so..."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"- Right. So you guys are in the middle of making the next Chicano Batman record?"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"- Yeah. Yeah. We're like at the end of it, so, you know,"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"just ready to send over files to the mixer."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"- Oh, okay."
01:17:10;01:17:13;"That's far and away my least favorite part of the process."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Mixing. - I'm having a blast, man."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"- Okay. You like it?"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"- I'm having a blast right now. I'm just like, you know, we got the tracks."
01:17:19;01:17:23;"I'm just going to my home studio and just like, just rocking vibes on it."
01:17:23;01:17:26;"- Uh-huh. So, like, probably gonna come out later this year?"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully. - 2019?"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"- We'll see. We're not sure. Not sure. That's still up in the air."
01:17:31;01:17:35;"- We were just talking about how one of the shows I'm most excited for this whole year"
01:17:35;01:17:39;"is Chicano Batman and Vampire Weekend, but we're also gonna be joined by Jake."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"- That's right."
01:17:42;01:17:45;"- Jake Schrifter's Jake's Griffoday cover band coming out to Chicago."
01:17:45;01:17:49;"I think it's gonna be a legendary show. And also, that's the Father's Day show."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"- Annual event at this point."
01:17:51;01:17:55;"- An annual event from Ojai to Chicago. I just think it's gonna be a good vibe."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"That one's also gonna be like outside."
01:17:57;01:18:00;"- Is that like a late afternoon start? Probs, right?"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"- Well, because it's Father's Day, I keep picturing it during the day,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"but I think it's probably like normal show time."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Yeah. Yeah. Probably like early evening."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"- That's gonna rule. - That's gonna be a major."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"Yeah. That's gonna-- Okay. I'm looking at it now. Okay."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"The Chicano Batman and Vampire Weekend tour starts June 5th in Toronto"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"and wraps up June 22nd in Charlotte, North Carolina."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"The Chicago one's probably right in the middle."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"- So how far west are you going?"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"- I don't know. - You don't know."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"- I don't know, man. Clearly, we're zigzagging. - Yeah."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"- Anyway, we're gonna do the top five together."
01:18:27;01:18:31;"But before we get into that, can we get your quick biography?"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"- Oh, man. Quick. All right. Well--"
01:18:33;01:18:36;"- With a focus on music, but you know, the main details."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"- The band, right? - No, no. You."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"- Me, personally? - Well, I know the band's part is"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"you know-- - Okay. Me, personally."
01:18:41;01:18:46;"Okay. I was born in Santa Ana, California, '84."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"My mom is from Columbia. - Oh, really?"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"- Yeah. - What's your birthday?"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"- September 3rd. - I'm April 8th, '84."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"- Okay. '84. - Okay. '84."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"- You're the rat. - That's right."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"- You're the rat. - Days between."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"- Just a couple rats."
01:19:00;01:19:03;"- The Rat Pack. So, yeah. My mom's is from Colombia."
01:19:03;01:19:05;"My dad is from Mexico. They came here."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"My pops actually came here when he was really young,"
01:19:08;01:19:11;"when he was six. Pretty much grew up in the States, in L.A."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"My mom's came out here when she was like 18."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"They ended up buying a house in La Mirada,"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"grew up in La Mirada. You know, a little quaint,"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"suburban lifestyle out there. Went through the school system,"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"went through college and all that. Went to UCLA,"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"did Cal State L.A. Always wanted to pursue music."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"- And did you have a band? - Well, I was playing music"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"since I was 18. I had like tons of bands."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"- What were your early bands like?"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"What were some of the names and genres?"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"- Sure. One of them was called the Yalot Sound System."
01:19:39;01:19:42;"It was on some like, yalot means corn in Nahuatl,"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"which is like Mexican indigenous tribe,"
01:19:45;01:19:50;"or basically the Aztecs. So, anyways, it sounded like reggae."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"We just had like reggae influences, rock and stuff,"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"all kinds of different influences."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"It kind of sounded like Santana."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"It was a mix of all kinds of different things."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"It was a lot of fun. It was so dope."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"I also had a crew, the homie Josh."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"He would just have us play music at his house."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"We would just have midnight sessions"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"from like midnight to like six in the morning."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"He collected all kinds of like heavy records."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"So, he was like a deep hip hop head."
01:20:16;01:20:19;"So, he had like all like Coltrane, you know,"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"all these crazy, super dope jazz records,"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"you know, on some just like breakbeat vibe."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"And we would just get like spiritual"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"and just like play like horns and (beep)"
01:20:30;01:20:33;"and make instruments and just have like crazy sessions."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"But yeah, that's how it was like for a while,"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"like 18, 19, 20, you know."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"I had another group, started this group called Buye Pongo."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"They're still playing out there in LA."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"They're doing very well. Shout out to Buye Pongo."
01:20:46;01:20:49;"Basically, we took hold of Colombian roots music."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"So, we started listening to Andres Landero,"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"which is from like a small town in the North Atlantic coast,"
01:20:55;01:20:59;"like super Afro-Colombian, like super just like heavy beats,"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"you know what I'm saying?"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"Like, super Afro-Colombian, like cumbia style, you know."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"It's not like the typical cumbia that you're hearing."
01:21:07;01:21:10;"It's just like super like, it's super bumping."
01:21:10;01:21:13;"So, anyways, we were super influenced by that"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"and we played that."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"And then simultaneously, that's around the time"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"that Chicano Batman evolved from that."
01:21:19;01:21:23;"I just wanted to kind of step away from that style of music"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"and just kind of delve more into like psychedelic,"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"kind of like rock influences."
01:21:28;01:21:33;"And also like, you know, just like Latin soul influences,"
01:21:33;01:21:36;"like Los Pasteles Verdes, Los Angeles Negros,"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"which are groups that come from like Chile, Peru."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"And they just sound super funky."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"They just sound like songs that you would find"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"on like compilation records, you know,"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"like Soundway records and stuff like that."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"And then just like, you know, analog Africa,"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"that type of thing."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"But it's stuff that you kind of grew up with."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Like your parents are kind of just already"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"like playing these tracks, you know,"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"or you're listening to it from the 60s,"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"from the 60s and 70s, like 70s, even 80s, you know?"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"So, yeah, that was kind of like the initial beginnings"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"of Chicano Batman doing stuff like that"
01:22:07;01:22:10;"or striving for that kind of like organ driven,"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"you know what I'm saying, sound and stuff,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"kind of soulful sound or whatever."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"But yeah, you know, we all have different influences."
01:22:17;01:22:20;"And, you know, now we're kind of like, I don't know,"
01:22:20;01:22:23;"I feel all of us have like our foot into like,"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"kind of like this disco, like Chaka Khan,"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"like, you know, always in the funk kind of world."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"But also our heads into like hip hop."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"You know, there's so many different influences"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"that we have, you know, growing up here on the West Coast,"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"you know, all the hip hop, you know, R&G, you know."
01:22:38;01:22:41;"- Right. - Anyways, a little bit."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- Yeah, I'm excited for your next album."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"- Oh yeah, I'm super excited too."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"- I can't wait to hear it. - Yeah, I can't wait for you"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"to hear it. - And also--"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"- I was listening to your music on the way over here."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"- Oh yeah, have you heard some of the new stuff?"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"- You put out a single, right, or something like that?"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"- We've been putting out a few new songs"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"and then the new record comes out in May."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"- Yeah. - And then the tour"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"that we're starting, because it's been so long"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"between records, is gonna be our first proper tour"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"in quite a few years. - You have like a whole concept"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"behind it, right? - With the tour?"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"- With the album. - Well, a little bit."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"It's a double album. I kind of felt like"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"for the first time, the first three albums"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"are all between 10 and 12 songs"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"and I was like, that felt good."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"But for the first time, I just like,"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I felt like I couldn't say everything"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"that I wanted to say. - So there definitely"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"is like a conceptual framework a little bit,"
01:23:27;01:23:30;"I think, like stretching out to 18 songs."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"And yeah, there's a lot of surprises on the album."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"But yeah, I can't wait for you to hear it."

01:25:33;01:25:35;"It's a good year for music, 1973."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"The reason we picked 1973 is because"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"before it was Panda Express,"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"there was a restaurant called the Panda Inn,"
01:25:41;01:25:44;"and it was opened by Andrew and Peggy Churn in Pasadena."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"So we were talking earlier,"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"just before we get into the Top Five,"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"I just have to ask you,"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"somebody grew up in Southern California,"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"because I realized I knew very little about it."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"What's your basic take on Panda Express?"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"(laughs)"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"It's a great place to get your head around"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"and it's evolved."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"It's evolved in a positive way?"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"No, it just turned into a chain."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"I remember when it was like Super Mom and Pops."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Oh, so you remembered actually being the small local thing."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"Yeah, I mean, we would go just, you know,"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"go straight up on a Carmonita,"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"like in our neighborhood."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"La Mirada Whittier."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"So we would always drive to Whittier, to the Quad,"
01:26:20;01:26:23;"and lo and behold, Panda Express."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"I mean, we would go there all the time."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"But it was just like, like I said, super, like, local."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"So like a super local spot."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"It was a local Chinese spot."
01:26:31;01:26:34;"Yeah, and all of a sudden it turned into a big-ass chain."
01:26:34;01:26:37;"Oh, so you actually watched it go from Mom and Pop"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"to gigantic in your lifetime."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Yeah, I just saw it."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"I think I never really took note of it, honestly."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"It's just like, wow, okay, here it is at the local,"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"you know, university circle or whatever."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Mm-hmm."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"It's on campus now."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"The Dallas airport."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Yeah, exactly."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Panda Express is on a lot of campuses and a lot of airports."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Exactly."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"And I think that's what we heard on this show,"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"which maybe everybody knew."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"We just always assumed that Panda Express, wrongly,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"I'll admit it, wrongly,"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"but I always assumed that Panda Express was like"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"a Taco Bell situation, which was like,"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"Glen Bell opens up Taco Bell because he's like,"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"oh, I can sell tacos."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"I always just assumed that Panda Express"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"was a similar thing."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"It turns out it's not."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"It's a Chinese family."
01:27:22;01:27:24;"Yeah, I mean, that makes sense to me."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"I mean, you know, like I said, it's just like"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"a super Chinese restaurant, like your average"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"person going to Taco Bell, like down the street,"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"it was always a chain."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Like it was always had like fancy font."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Yeah."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Logos were on point."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"In the 80s and 90s, they had like the crazy colors"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"in the interiors that they don't have anymore."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Of course."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Yeah."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"Don't talk about never had."
01:27:48;01:27:50;"Well, I guess like the purple and the teal."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"Yeah."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"They had like a very appetizing, right?"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Wild colors came back then."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Wow."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"I mean, I think I've heard of the number five"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"song on the Billboard charts this week in 1973."
01:28:00;01:28:02;"Four Tops."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Ain't No Woman Like The One I've Got."
01:28:04;01:28:08;"I mean, this is a strong start."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Yeah."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"A lot of times we go back to certain years"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"and it's just garbage."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You don't always get classics."
01:28:15;01:28:19;"I never knew this was the four tops."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"I thought it was the spinners."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"I think there's a lot of versions of it."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"This must have been one of their last hits."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Maybe their last."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Right."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Yes."
01:28:30;01:28:40;"So good."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"Also like opening with a chorus."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Always a strong move."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Yeah, definitely."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Definitely."
01:28:48;01:29:11;"The original version it says was recorded"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"by Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"on their 1972 album"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Hallway Symphony."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"I know this song was written by this guy"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Dennis Lambert."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"There are a lot of versions."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Mamas and the Papas."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Johnny Mathis."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Mamas and the Papas."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Melvin Sparks."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Wait, is this a 90s version?"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Dude, it was also covered by Jerry Garcia."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Included in the Garcia Volume 9"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"Live Box."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"Do you guys know this version?"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"Uh-uh."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"What year is this?"
01:29:47;01:29:52;"It's got to be 90s."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"It says '98."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Remastered '98."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Oh, it sounds like 80s Bobby Brown to me."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"Yeah, it does."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Yeah, it could be like."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Like, ""Every little step I take."""
01:30:04;01:30:06;"So was this like an ironic throwback"
01:30:06;01:30:09;"in '98 to the sound like 10 years earlier?"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Yeah, it was."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"It was a throwback to the sound"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"that was 10 years earlier?"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"I'm very confused."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"No, I think this is just like a reinterpretation."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"I mean, I was saying that there's also"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"the Jay-Z and Foxy Brown song."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Reinterpreted?"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"Yeah, reinterpreted."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Let's check out the Jerry Garcia version."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"We've got it on Apple Music."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Could be rough, folks."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"This could be rough stuff."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Barto, are you a Jerry fan?"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"I've never really got into it, honestly."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"At all?"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Like any of the dead?"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"I've never tried."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"Well, strap in for Chicago."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Maybe you could start out"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"by watching Richard Pictures in Chicago"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"to dip your toe."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"I had a neighborhood friend that,"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"you know, just was like Jerry Garcia'd out."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"You know, just like everything on the walls."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"The whole thing, the whole nine yards."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"But I never, for whatever reason, got into it."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"A true deadhead."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Honestly, this sounds great."
01:31:06;01:31:08;"This sounds amazing."
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Is this just an instrumental cover?"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"Wait, by the way,"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"this is him live playing with Merle Saunders,"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"who's a keyboardist."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"This version's 17 minutes."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"In classic Jerry fashion."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"I'm just going to skip that and see what happens."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"The beat is so dope."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Yeah, great drummer."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"I wonder if this is Kreutzmann."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"I'm a fan now."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"Yeah, this is dope."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"This is big."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I love the flute."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"A flutist."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"This is legit."
01:31:44;01:31:46;"This is tight."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Minute nine."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Usually when we bring up obscure Grateful Dead stuff"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"on the show, it's terrible."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"They were prolific and they recorded"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"a lot of terrible music."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"I already felt deceived."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"I was like, the Spinners recorded"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Ain't No Woman Like The One of God"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"and they didn't do that."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"I was just looking down."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"I'm like, what the fuck?"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Now you're back, dude."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"Now we're listening to Jerry"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"just fucking rip this shit."
01:32:13;01:32:15;"It's a parallel universe going on."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"I love Jerry doing a 17 minute"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"instrumental cover."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"It's fucking hard."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"You know, with the Spinners thing,"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"isn't that the Mandela effect?"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"Are you familiar with that?"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"No."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"What's the definition of the Mandela effect?"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Off the top of my head,"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"I think it's when there's a shared belief"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"in something that's not true."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"That's what just happened to us."
01:32:39;01:32:40;"We're like, oh yeah, yeah, right."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"There's somebody else did it."
01:32:42;01:32:44;"We're just like, a lot of people"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"have the same memory of something"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"happening differently, but then"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"that historical record doesn't support it."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Isn't the example they always go to is--"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"The carpet's gone."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Or that movie Shazam that doesn't exist."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"With Shaq?"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Yeah, but that was called--"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Shazam?"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"I'm sorry."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"What's Shazam?"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"No, that was a movie with Shaq."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"That doesn't exist."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Wow."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"The comedian Sid Bat, and people can"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"picture the poster and stuff of Sinbad."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"That movie never happened."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"No, I remember that."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"I remember my dad took me to see Shazam with Sinbad."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"I remember we got some Twizzlers."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"He let me get a Coke."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"We had popcorn."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Yeah, I remember Shazam."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"That's a good movie."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Okay, so Four Tops Ain't No Woman."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Great, just classic song."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"That was number five in 1973."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"Now, in 2019, the number five songs on iTunes"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"right now, BTS."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Oh, Built a Spill's back on the charts again?"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Oh yeah, it's great."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"You know, '90s indie rock's been having"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"a real big comeback lately."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"Well, Dinosaur Jr. had that hit in Japan a few months ago."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Right, exactly."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"And it's great that Doug Marsh is doing so well."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Bart, are you familiar with BTS?"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"No."
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Not Built a Spill?"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"No."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Jake, I know that you know that I'm not"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"talking about Built a Spill."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"I'm talking about K-pop."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Excuse me."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Sorry I didn't have the lingo down."
01:34:11;01:34:13;"It's a Korean popular music group."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"BTS?"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Yeah, that's the name of my kid's school."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"It's BTS?"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Bell Tower School."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"Are they one of those schools that trains you"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"to be a Korean pop star?"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Pretty much, yeah."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"It's a trilingual immersion."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Yeah, well, and also, people always talk about"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"in Korea, I don't know to what extent it's true."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"This might just be a stereotype, but people"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"are not really aware of the stage."
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Like Disney kids style?"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"A little bit."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"Like Justin Timberlake?"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"A management company might have essentially a"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"school where they sign, you know, I guess"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"it's like sports."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"Yeah."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"You know, occasionally a soccer team will sign"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"a 12-year-old."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Like AYSO for music."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Yeah, I think it kind of is."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"There's like scouts."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"They're talent shows."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"They're becoming like the biggest K-pop"
01:35:04;01:35:05;"groups in the world."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I'm not sure about it."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Did you watch?"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"I will."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"I have not watched it yet."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"I watched it a little bit and I was like,"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"I didn't even think about the music."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"You know, it can be hard on SNL to really take"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"in a song."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"You know, and a lot of times I skip the musical"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"artists."
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Because you feel terrible about the mixing"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"situation."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"The mixes can be tough."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"And also, you know, I get enough music during"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"the day."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"I've been to a couple of shows."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"I've been to a couple of shows."

02:05:43;02:05:45;"Horse tack is attached."
02:05:45;02:05:47;"What's a horse tack?"
02:05:47;02:05:53;"A horse tack refers to equipment equipped on horses in the course of their use."
02:05:53;02:05:56;"Saddles, stirrups, bridles."
02:05:56;02:05:58;"Oh, so it's like a general word."
02:05:58;02:06:00;"You got your horse tack on your horse?"
02:06:00;02:06:01;"Sir, I got it all here."
02:06:01;02:06:04;"Who here has ever properly ridden a horse?"
02:06:04;02:06:06;"I have."
02:06:06;02:06:08;"Have you galloped on a horse?"
02:06:08;02:06:10;"No."
02:06:10;02:06:12;"What are the other terms for a horse moving?"
02:06:12;02:06:14;"Gallop, trot."
02:06:14;02:06:16;"I've trotted."
02:06:16;02:06:18;"What's the longest you ever were on a horse?"
02:06:18;02:06:20;"A couple hours."
02:06:20;02:06:22;"You were on a horse for a couple hours?"
02:06:22;02:06:24;"I was on a horse for a few hours last summer."
02:06:24;02:06:26;"Wow, you're Billy Ray Cyrus."
02:06:26;02:06:28;"In Idaho."
02:06:29;02:06:30;"I think I've heard that story."
02:06:30;02:06:32;"It's kind of a non-story."
02:06:32;02:06:34;"Were you sore after?"
02:06:34;02:06:36;"Yeah, actually I was."
02:06:36;02:06:38;"It hurts the hind quarters."
02:06:38;02:06:40;"It depends how good your horse tack is."
02:06:40;02:06:42;"Not a fan of that whole process."
02:06:42;02:06:44;"I think I've been on a horse."
02:06:44;02:06:47;"I don't think I've ever truly ridden a horse."
02:06:47;02:06:50;"I feel like I may have been in a situation where somebody's like,"
02:06:50;02:06:52;"""Hey, you want to sit on this horse?"""
02:06:52;02:06:54;"I'll try anything once."
02:06:54;02:06:56;"It's stressful when you're going up and down,"
02:06:57;02:06:59;"up the rocky hillsides, which is what I was doing last summer."
02:06:59;02:07:01;"Oh my God."
02:07:01;02:07:03;"It was stressful."
02:07:03;02:07:05;"Because you just have to have faith that a horse doesn't have a death wish?"
02:07:05;02:07:07;"Yeah, that the horse is sure-footed."
02:07:07;02:07:09;"You're just like, ""All right."""
02:07:09;02:07:11;"What was the horse's name?"
02:07:11;02:07:13;"I don't know."
02:07:13;02:07:15;"""All right, Missy, let's just trot down this."""
02:07:15;02:07:17;"""Take her easy."""
02:07:17;02:07:19;"""Let's just take her easy,"" and then Missy breaks into a full gallop?"
02:07:19;02:07:21;"That would be terrifying."
02:07:21;02:07:23;"So it would basically be like driving a car down a windy mountain,"
02:07:23;02:07:25;"except that the car is sentient."
02:07:26;02:07:27;"It's a self-driving car."
02:07:27;02:07:29;"Yeah, it'd be like driving a self-driving car."
02:07:29;02:07:33;"Horses are the original self-driving cars."
02:07:33;02:07:35;"There you go."
02:07:35;02:07:37;"Whoa."
02:07:37;02:07:39;"You guys ever ridden a horse?"
02:07:39;02:07:41;"Seinfeld?"
02:07:41;02:07:43;"Same as you."
02:07:43;02:07:45;"Someone in elementary school was like, ""There's a horse here,"""
02:07:45;02:07:47;"and then you sit on it for 10 seconds."
02:07:47;02:07:49;"Do they have horses up there in Canada?"
02:07:49;02:07:51;"Not anymore."
02:07:51;02:07:53;"Not since the '90s."
02:07:53;02:07:55;"I think they used to."
02:07:55;02:07:56;"They're on a little mountainside, but nothing crazy."
02:07:56;02:07:58;"You're alone on a horse for, like, what, 45?"
02:07:58;02:08:00;"No, no, no, no."
02:08:00;02:08:02;"Not alone."
02:08:02;02:08:04;"It was just like a tour thing."
02:08:04;02:08:06;"Are the horses connected?"
02:08:06;02:08:08;"Where were you?"
02:08:08;02:08:10;"I want to say I was in Mexico, maybe."
02:08:10;02:08:12;"Like out in the countryside?"
02:08:12;02:08:14;"Yeah, on the countryside or something like that."
02:08:14;02:08:16;"Yeah, it's been a while."
02:08:16;02:08:18;"I think I was like 12 or something."
02:08:18;02:08:20;"You know there's a part of Burbank that has--"
02:08:20;02:08:22;"it's like the sort of backside of Griffith Park,"
02:08:23;02:08:24;"that section of Griffith Park."
02:08:24;02:08:26;"And it's a horse community."
02:08:26;02:08:29;"Those houses have horse stables, and there's dirt trails."
02:08:29;02:08:31;"Yeah, yeah, all over."
02:08:31;02:08:33;"It's crazy."
02:08:33;02:08:35;"There were some really scary fires in the past couple years"
02:08:35;02:08:38;"that affected that area, and it was terrifying for horse owners,"
02:08:38;02:08:41;"because even if you can get out, the horse is another story."
02:08:41;02:08:43;"Yeah, I think there's a lot of these kind of horse communities."
02:08:43;02:08:45;"There is, actually."
02:08:45;02:08:47;"Hidden hills, out in Calamasis."
02:08:47;02:08:49;"Even where you wouldn't expect it, like urban areas,"
02:08:50;02:08:52;"like the San Gabriel River Valley,"
02:08:52;02:08:54;"like basically where the--"
02:08:54;02:08:56;"right along the river bank."
02:08:56;02:08:59;"The river bank that takes you from Whittier"
02:08:59;02:09:01;"all the way down to the beach."
02:09:01;02:09:04;"There's a whole community from Whittier to Southgate,"
02:09:04;02:09:06;"all the way down."
02:09:06;02:09:09;"Anyways, there's a group of people who have houses and land,"
02:09:09;02:09:11;"and they have horses right next to the river bed."
02:09:11;02:09:14;"I've seen this one dude in Highland Park twice with his horse,"
02:09:14;02:09:16;"like just out on York."
02:09:16;02:09:18;"I remember--"
02:09:19;02:09:20;"I pulled over and took a photo."
02:09:20;02:09:23;"He's walking in front of the 99-cent store on York."
02:09:23;02:09:25;"And he's riding a horse?"
02:09:25;02:09:27;"And I just snapped a photo a couple years ago."
02:09:27;02:09:29;"Was he like an older fella?"
02:09:29;02:09:31;"No, he wasn't riding it. He was leading it."
02:09:31;02:09:33;"He was just walking down the sidewalk."
02:09:33;02:09:35;"And I was like, ""What is happening?"""
02:09:35;02:09:37;"I'm gonna take my horse to the York--"
02:09:37;02:09:39;"(singing)"
02:09:39;02:09:41;"To the Yorktown Road."
02:09:41;02:09:43;"But also, Highland Park is--"
02:09:43;02:09:45;"there's some real hipster stuff now, right?"
02:09:45;02:09:47;"Sure."
02:09:48;02:09:49;"I'm gonna go to Highland Park."
02:09:49;02:09:51;"Oh, geez. Civil Coffee?"
02:09:51;02:09:54;"I'm gonna take my horse to the Civil Coffee."
02:09:54;02:09:59;"Gonna ride overpass bowling at the Highland Bowl."
02:09:59;02:10:01;"I wonder if like--"
02:10:01;02:10:03;"So clearly, there's horses--"
02:10:03;02:10:06;"A lot of us city slicker types,"
02:10:06;02:10:08;"we only see horses when we're riding down the highway."
02:10:08;02:10:10;"Clearly, there's horse communities"
02:10:10;02:10:12;"tucked into every nook and cranny of America."
02:10:12;02:10:15;"I wonder if there's some weird combination of this song"
02:10:16;02:10:18;"and just like everything getting crazy"
02:10:18;02:10:20;"is gonna lead to more people"
02:10:20;02:10:23;"taking their horses out into civilization."
02:10:23;02:10:27;"I could kind of picture that in Silver Lake or something."
02:10:27;02:10:29;"They're like, ""Oh yeah, there's this dude"
02:10:29;02:10:31;"who always takes his horse to Cafe Stella."""
02:10:31;02:10:33;"Like, they let him in?"
02:10:33;02:10:35;"No, of course they don't let him in. He ties it up."
02:10:35;02:10:37;"It's just on sunset."
02:10:37;02:10:39;"I could picture that. I think that might be the wave"
02:10:39;02:10:41;"for the rest of 2019, 2020."
02:10:41;02:10:43;"It's just like more people just taking their horse"
02:10:43;02:10:45;"down to the Old Town Road."
02:10:45;02:10:46;"I could picture like in New York,"
02:10:46;02:10:48;"just like some annoying kid be like,"
02:10:48;02:10:50;"""Oh yeah, what's the story with that kid"
02:10:50;02:10:52;"who always rides that horse down Canal Street?"""
02:10:52;02:10:54;"And they're just--"
02:10:54;02:10:56;"And they're just like, ""Oh, his dad's a really famous"
02:10:56;02:10:58;"French movie director."""
02:10:58;02:11:00;"Maybe that's the one thing--"
02:11:00;02:11:02;"That's what Trump meant."
02:11:02;02:11:04;"Get your horse. Get on a horse."
02:11:04;02:11:06;"He didn't mean the 1950s."
02:11:06;02:11:08;"He meant like the 1780s."
02:11:08;02:11:10;"Is Old Town Road proof that a horse"
02:11:10;02:11:12;"is like a consensus animal that could unite people?"
02:11:13;02:11:14;"The horse as a symbol has brought"
02:11:14;02:11:16;"trap and country together."
02:11:16;02:11:18;"That's a good point."
02:11:18;02:11:20;"And in Canada, ever since they got rid of horses,"
02:11:20;02:11:22;"it's become--"
02:11:22;02:11:24;"They got some trap. They got some hotline bling."
02:11:24;02:11:26;"That's right."
02:11:26;02:11:28;"I'm gonna take my horse."
02:11:28;02:11:30;"You know what I think we determined today?"
02:11:30;02:11:32;"Horses are pretty cool."
02:11:32;02:11:34;"And I think Old Town Road"
02:11:34;02:11:36;"is only gonna help that."
02:11:36;02:11:38;"And I really--"
02:11:38;02:11:40;"I think it's gonna be interesting for the rest of this year."
02:11:40;02:11:42;"You're gonna see more and more young people"
02:11:42;02:11:43;"embracing the horse lifestyle."
02:11:43;02:11:45;"And you're gonna see people"
02:11:45;02:11:47;"who used to be into fixed gear bikes"
02:11:47;02:11:49;"and things like that are actually gonna get more"
02:11:49;02:11:51;"into horses."
02:11:51;02:11:53;"F*ck skateboards. It's all about horses."
02:11:53;02:11:55;"Oh, yeah. Skateboards are over."
02:11:55;02:11:57;"We're gonna see horse parks opening."
02:11:57;02:11:59;"I'm excited for it."
02:11:59;02:12:01;"Horse training."
02:12:01;02:12:03;"Oh, yeah."
02:12:03;02:12:05;"Or Shetland ponies."
02:12:05;02:12:07;"Oh, yeah. And then there's little horses, too."
02:12:07;02:12:09;"More compact."
02:12:09;02:12:11;"Yeah. I can't wait for this wave."
02:12:11;02:12:12;"We're in a time crisis today."
02:12:12;02:12:14;"Thanks so much to Bardo from Chicano Batman."
02:12:14;02:12:17;"We will see you on tour soon."
02:12:17;02:12:19;"Come out and bring your horse."
02:12:19;02:12:21;"Bring a horse."
02:12:21;02:12:23;"We can't speak for the venues,"
02:12:23;02:12:25;"but if you want to ride a horse to the venue"
02:12:25;02:12:27;"and tie it up,"
02:12:27;02:12:29;"that's absolutely fine with me."
02:12:29;02:12:31;"Ride a horse."
02:12:31;02:12:33;"You know what we should see for the Chicago show"
02:12:33;02:12:35;"because it's a big kind of park"
02:12:35;02:12:37;"and it's Father's Day?"
02:12:37;02:12:39;"Let's just get one horse."
02:12:40;02:12:41;"Maybe in the grassy--"
02:12:41;02:12:43;"in the lawn area."
02:12:43;02:12:45;"Just chowing down?"
02:12:45;02:12:47;"Well, you know, maybe with a horse trainer"
02:12:47;02:12:49;"and maybe you could feed it a carrot or something."
02:12:49;02:12:51;"Maybe you pay a dollar,"
02:12:51;02:12:53;"you get to feed it a carrot."
02:12:53;02:12:55;"Anyway."
02:12:55;02:12:57;"See you next time."
02:12:57;02:13:01;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:13:01;02:13:03;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
02:13:03;02:13:05;"Sports. One."
