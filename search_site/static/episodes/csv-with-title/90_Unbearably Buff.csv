00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:04;00:09;"On this week's episode, we dig into two new songs from up and coming band Vampire Weekend."
00:09;00:14;"We also briefly discuss this year's festivals, including the Skull and Roses Grateful Dead"
00:14;00:20;"Festival in Ventura, all this, plus the greatest hits of 2019 and 1969."
00:20;00:25;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:15;01:18;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:18;01:19;"Hello, Jake."
01:19;01:20;"Hey, man."
01:20;01:21;"Episode 90."
01:21;01:22;"Really?"
01:22;01:23;"Spring 90."
01:23;01:24;"Oh my God."
01:24;01:25;"Yeah, spring 90."
01:25;01:28;"Great time for the Grateful Dead."
01:28;01:33;"I'm not a real head about the 90s stuff, but the people that I know that are full dead"
01:33;01:36;"completists all swear by spring 90."
01:36;01:42;"I feel like a few years ago, there was an officially released best of the whole spring"
01:42;01:43;"of 1990."
01:43;01:44;"Right."
01:44;01:48;"For people who don't know, hardcore Grateful Dead heads, people have their favorite years"
01:48;01:51;"and their favorite eras, and clearly their favorite, not even just full year, is their"
01:51;01:53;"favorite season of a year."
01:53;01:55;"Spring 77 is a very-"
01:55;01:56;"It's a classic."
01:56;01:57;"Classic time."
01:57;02:02;"I wonder if even real hardcore dead heads are kind of like spring 77 is overrated."
02:02;02:03;"Oh, I'm sure."
02:03;02:07;"You remember a few years ago, they released that Cornell 77 show?"
02:07;02:08;"Sure."
02:08;02:09;"That was really trumpeted to everybody."
02:09;02:12;"It's like, ""Hey, maybe you don't know that much about the Grateful Dead, but this is"
02:12;02:14;"considered their best show."""
02:14;02:19;"I feel like in any community, the people who are just real heads are probably like, ""Oh"
02:19;02:20;"yeah, entry level."""
02:20;02:24;"I can see why you might think that's the best Grateful Dead show ever, but actually-"
02:24;02:28;"Actually, dude, May 3rd, 90."
02:28;02:35;"Was spring 90 kind of like some of the last great recordings with Brent?"
02:35;02:37;"Yeah, I think Brent died-"
02:37;02:38;"The end of the Brent era."
02:38;02:39;"... summer or fall of 90."
02:39;02:40;"Oh, damn."
02:40;02:42;"To be replaced by Bruce Hornsby."
02:42;02:43;"Among others."
02:43;02:44;"Yeah."
02:44;02:45;"Vince Walnick."
02:45;02:46;"Right."
02:46;02:50;"Yeah, to me, spring 90- This is not exactly where we plan on taking the show."
02:50;02:55;"Sorry, I just saw on the sheet it said episode 90, and it's like, ""It's springtime now."""
02:55;02:57;"I've thrown on spring 90 a bunch."
02:57;03:01;"I mean, the number one thing that differentiates it is the keyboard sounds."
03:01;03:02;"There's these kind of like-"
03:02;03:03;"Should we throw some on?"
03:03;03:04;"... more of a synthy."
03:04;03:08;"All right, let's throw on some spring 90 just so people know what we're talking about."
03:08;03:09;"Episode 90, though."
03:09;03:10;"That's crazy."
03:10;03:11;"Respect."
03:11;03:12;"Respect to us."
03:12;03:15;"We're out here doing it, man."
03:15;03:16;"Twice a month."
03:16;03:19;"To all the haters who thought Time Crisis was a fluke, you know what's funny?"
03:19;03:24;"We'll talk about it more in a second, but I just did a full week of press in the UK,"
03:24;03:29;"and I found that a thing that a lot of journalists say to me lately is like, ""Well, so you've"
03:29;03:30;"been gone for six years."
03:30;03:31;"Can we talk about that?"""
03:31;03:32;"I'm like, ""Sure."""
03:32;03:35;"They're like, ""That's a really long time to be gone between albums."""
03:35;03:37;"But it's not like you've exactly been sitting around."
03:37;03:38;"You've been busy."
03:38;03:40;"I mean, you made a cartoon."
03:40;03:42;"You wrote a song for Beyonce."
03:42;03:44;"You've been doing a radio show."
03:44;03:47;"At first, I kind of rolled with it, and I was like, ""Yeah, you're right."""
03:47;03:50;"Then lately, I've just been kind of like, ""Well, let's keep it real."""
03:50;03:51;"There was a lot of sitting around, too."
03:51;03:56;"I was like, ""Time Crisis is four hours a month."""
03:56;03:59;"The Beyonce song was one song over six years."
03:59;04:04;"To be fair, the cartoon was time-consuming, but even that was one specific year."
04:04;04:09;"Oh, I like this West LA fadeaway."
04:09;04:17;"March 22, 1990."
04:17;04:19;"I'm sure this is very sacrilegious."
04:19;04:23;"I always think about this when I end up looking at some Grateful Dead message board"
04:23;04:28;"and people are fighting tooth and nail about which performance was better."
04:28;04:30;"Maybe this is because I'm a studio guy."
04:30;04:35;"I just want to be like, ""I know you guys think that Jerry's solo on Scarlet Begonia's"
04:35;04:41;"was way more lyrical that year, but you also just like the recording quality better"
04:41;04:43;"of certain bootlegs than others."""
04:43;04:45;"Sure, just the sound."
04:45;04:48;"It's one thing to be like, ""I was at these two shows, and this one had a different vibe."""
04:48;04:52;"But there's also parts--because I just listen to these, and it sounds--"
04:52;04:54;"Reverby, chorus-y."
04:54;04:57;"That drum sound just wouldn't exist in another era."
04:57;04:59;"Yeah, it doesn't sound like '72."
04:59;05:01;"I know that the playing's a little bit different, too."
05:01;05:04;"No, I agree completely. I feel like it's the tones."
05:04;05:07;"This is an '80s song. Let's play an actual '70s song."
05:07;05:09;"I mean, dude, tasteful palette, man."
05:09;05:11;"Right, 1990 is not your favorite palette."
05:11;05:13;"It's not a good palette."
05:13;05:17;"Which is why I don't connect with spring '90. I know people swear by it."
05:17;05:21;"I also feel like these recordings--just everything sounds a little more distant than like--"
05:21;05:25;"I mean, Europe '72, it almost sounds like a studio recording."
05:25;05:30;"It does. There might have been some tomfoolery with Europe '72."
05:30;05:33;"Maybe some vocal overdubs."
05:33;05:35;"Is that some organ up there?"
05:35;05:37;"This sounds terrible."
05:38;05:40;"[playing]"
05:40;05:52;"The playing's different, but the sounds are also--"
05:52;05:54;"It's just hard to know what's hitting you first."
05:54;05:55;"Yeah."
05:55;05:57;"I don't know how to describe it."
05:57;06:00;"All these spring '90 recordings, the officially released ones at least,"
06:00;06:02;"they feel like airy."
06:02;06:04;"Maybe because they're literally in bigger rooms, you know?"
06:04;06:07;"They're like arenas and stadiums."
06:07;06:09;"[playing]"
06:09;06:22;"Now I'm curious. Put on '77 Cornell, Scarlett Begonia's."
06:22;06:27;"And I bet the tempo will be different, but the tone, like the palette will be way different."
06:27;06:28;"Not so wet."
06:28;06:29;"Right."
06:29;06:32;"All right, so we're going back in time 13 years."
06:32;06:34;"Spring '90."
06:34;06:35;"I love that it's only 13 years."
06:35;06:36;"I know."
06:36;06:45;"It's already just such a better sounding recording even before they start playing."
06:45;06:49;"All right, now we're going to play everybody's favorite fun game, Move Back."
06:49;06:52;"Oh yeah, this is Bobby Chet. I'm Chet. I'm skipping ahead."
06:52;06:54;"[playing]"
06:54;06:57;"It's such a different--"
06:57;06:58;"So close."
06:58;07:00;"--mic situation already."
07:00;07:02;"[playing]"
07:02;07:06;"Those Phil Bass bombs."
07:06;07:07;"Yeah."
07:07;07:13;"Pretty similar tempo actually."
07:13;07:15;"[playing]"
07:18;07:38;"I'm not even an audiophile, but I'm just a studio dude."
07:38;07:39;"Yeah."
07:39;07:42;"I just feel like the idea that I could listen to these two recordings"
07:42;07:47;"and just kind of be like, focus on the playing is so hard for me."
07:47;07:50;"I don't know if the tempo or the vibe is that different."
07:50;07:52;"It's just drastically different recordings."
07:52;07:54;"[playing]"
08:10;08:12;"Anyway, episode--"
08:12;08:13;"Little dead detour there."
08:13;08:15;"Episode 90."
08:15;08:17;"This again, we're going to be very straightforward this year."
08:17;08:19;"This is a pre-recorded episode."
08:19;08:20;"But you know what, man?"
08:20;08:23;"It's going out live, so it's not a rerun."
08:23;08:24;"It's new content."
08:24;08:26;"It's new content airing live."
08:26;08:30;"You know, it's like when Game of Thrones comes back on TV,"
08:30;08:32;"you're going to be like, ""It's not live."""
08:32;08:34;"You know? Same thing."
08:34;08:37;"They taped that like six months ago, man."
08:37;08:40;"Yeah, sometimes I'm watching GOT and I just think about the fact that"
08:40;08:45;"they probably wrote it like two years ago, filmed it minimum a year ago."
08:45;08:46;"It feels stale."
08:46;08:47;"Not current."
08:47;08:49;"It's not."
08:49;08:50;"So this is like a Game of Thrones."
08:50;08:53;"Anyway, got a lot of traveling."
08:53;08:55;"Yeah, man. So you were in the UK?"
08:55;08:57;"I was in the UK for a week."
08:57;09:01;"Vampire Weekend played three shows and also just did a ton of interviews."
09:01;09:03;"What sort of rooms were you playing?"
09:03;09:06;"We billed them as our three little London shows."
09:06;09:09;"We played a venue called Earth in Hackney."
09:09;09:11;"I think that was like about 850."
09:11;09:12;"It's a chill name."
09:12;09:14;"So basically we played Thursday night at this place, Earth."
09:14;09:17;"Then on Friday we moved into this place called Islington Assembly Hall,"
09:17;09:18;"which is probably 600 or 700."
09:18;09:20;"We played there Friday night."
09:20;09:23;"And then real quick turnaround, similar to the legendary Ohio Weekend"
09:23;09:26;"with Richard Pictures, we came back Saturday morning."
09:26;09:27;"Same venue."
09:28;09:30;"So we did three shows in about 36 hours."
09:30;09:31;"Saturday morning show?"
09:31;09:32;"Yeah."
09:32;09:33;"What time?"
09:33;09:34;"Hit the stage at 10 a.m."
09:34;09:36;"Why?"
09:36;09:39;"Well, I've had this instinct for a long time that Vampire Weekend"
09:39;09:40;"should do morning shows."
09:40;09:42;"I mean, it's the same reason why in Ojai we could have done"
09:42;09:43;"Saturday night, Sunday night."
09:43;09:44;"Right."
09:44;09:48;"But I had this feeling, which I think has become a little bit of a trend now."
09:48;09:51;"Kanye's been doing these kind of outdoor Sunday morning jams."
09:51;09:52;"Really?"
09:52;09:53;"Yeah."
09:53;09:54;"Where does he do those?"
09:54;09:55;"I believe at his home in Calabasas."
09:55;09:56;"Invite only."
09:56;09:58;"I think invite only."
09:58;10:03;"They're called Sunday services and he has like a gospel choir singing his stuff."
10:03;10:05;"I mean, in his case, I think there's also a religious angle."
10:05;10:06;"Okay."
10:06;10:09;"It's kind of about the music, but it's also a little bit of just--it's like church."
10:09;10:11;"But anyway, you know, great minds think alike."
10:11;10:15;"Vampire Weekend pioneered the Sunday morning show about a year ago."
10:15;10:17;"You know, it's like when you're hanging out."
10:17;10:19;"It's like spend Saturday night going out to the bar."
10:19;10:21;"Let's get brunch on Sunday."
10:21;10:24;"And also I feel like on Sundays there's still good vibes Sunday morning."
10:24;10:27;"By Sunday night, awful."
10:27;10:29;"Those Sunday night dreads."
10:29;10:30;"Yeah, the worst."
10:30;10:31;"Like when you're in school."
10:31;10:35;"I guess being at a show on a Sunday night is maybe a way to avoid the dread."
10:35;10:37;"I guess if you go to a concert on Sunday night, you're a little bit like,"
10:37;10:39;"""Wait, what day is it?"""
10:39;10:40;"Yeah."
10:40;10:44;"Better than just sitting at home watching Game of Thrones."
10:44;10:46;"Just watching a stale ass--"
10:46;10:47;"Watching billions."
10:47;10:49;"--pre-taped Game of Thrones."
10:49;10:52;"Just thinking about how you got to go to work or school."
10:52;10:57;"The only thing that I'll say about a Sunday night vibe is that in times in my life,"
10:57;11:01;"like the aforementioned six years between albums,"
11:01;11:04;"some of these moments where I actually didn't have all that much to do,"
11:04;11:07;"where I'm kind of waiting to really start in earnest on a project,"
11:07;11:11;"when I've had obviously the privilege of not having work on Monday,"
11:11;11:14;"but also occasionally a little too much free time,"
11:14;11:19;"I will say that there are times where on a Sunday night I almost have a good vibe"
11:19;11:23;"because I'm like, ""You know what? I need the Monday morning reboot."""
11:23;11:27;"Otherwise, I feel like this endless-- I'm living in an endless weekend."
11:27;11:28;"Right."
11:28;11:30;"And my life is lacking meaning and direction."
11:30;11:33;"At least tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll be Monday,"
11:33;11:36;"and if I go to the coffee shop, I'll look around and be like, ""Yeah."""
11:36;11:37;"You're a part of the world."
11:37;11:38;"I'm a part of the world."
11:38;11:39;"There's a little hustle and bustle."
11:39;11:40;"Yeah."
11:40;11:42;"So anyway, I've always liked the idea of morning shows,"
11:42;11:44;"and I always thought it suited Vampire Weekend."
11:44;11:46;"I mean, come on, wasn't it a good vibe in Ojai?"
11:46;11:47;"It's great."
11:47;11:50;"I think you guys played at like noon or one, though, in Ojai."
11:50;11:53;"I think Pictures played at like 10."
11:53;11:54;"11?"
11:54;11:55;"Maybe 10 or 11."
11:55;11:57;"Maybe you guys were 10, 30, 11, and we were like noon."
11:57;11:58;"Yeah."
11:58;12:01;"Hitting the stage-- Headliner, was there an opener?"
12:01;12:03;"No, there are no openers at any of these shows."
12:03;12:04;"That's tight."
12:04;12:09;"So hitting the stage at 10 in an indoor club is funny."
12:09;12:11;"This place-- I don't fully understand this."
12:11;12:14;"It's literally like the-- I'm going to get this wrong."
12:14;12:18;"Islington I think of as like a neighborhood in London,"
12:18;12:22;"but it's also like an official neighborhood too."
12:22;12:25;"They have a little council for that area."
12:25;12:26;"Okay."
12:26;12:28;"Like West Hollywood or something."
12:28;12:29;"Yeah, kind of."
12:29;12:31;"So it's like a place that has a lot of public meetings"
12:31;12:34;"and maybe even like the city council might do stuff."
12:34;12:35;"I don't know."
12:35;12:38;"It has a stage, but it also almost seems like a community center type place."
12:38;12:40;"So anyway, there's big windows."
12:40;12:43;"Actually, the vibe was like you got some sunlight coming in plus some lights."
12:43;12:46;"It wasn't like crowding people into like a dank--"
12:46;12:48;"Windowless."
12:48;12:49;"Yeah."
12:49;12:53;"I think of all these like pre-album shows a little bit as like attended rehearsals."
12:53;12:54;"Yeah."
12:54;12:56;"Where it's kind of like, ""Yo, it's mellow."""
12:56;12:58;"Like we're not here putting on the show."
12:58;13:00;"You know, we only have four new songs out."
13:00;13:01;"Did you play the new material?"
13:01;13:02;"Oh, yeah."
13:02;13:03;"Nice."
13:03;13:04;"That was cool because it was the first time we ever played--"
13:04;13:05;"Harmony."
13:05;13:07;"Harmony, Big Blue, 2021, Sunflower."
13:07;13:08;"Damn."
13:08;13:11;"And we got some special spins on some of them live,"
13:11;13:13;"especially 2021 and Big Blue."
13:13;13:14;"Like they're so short--"
13:14;13:15;"Yeah."
13:15;13:16;"--in the official version."
13:16;13:18;"We have like a couple versions now."
13:18;13:19;"Where you take it out."
13:19;13:21;"Yeah, just extend it a little bit."
13:21;13:24;"And not even like jamming necessarily, but just like more parts."
13:24;13:25;"[MUSIC - BIG BLUE, ""HARMONY""]"
13:25;13:28;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
13:28;13:31;"I was so overcome with emotion."
13:31;13:34;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
13:34;13:38;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
13:38;13:41;"Then you offered protection."
13:41;13:44;"So am I learning my lesson?"
13:44;13:47;"Or am I back on my own?"
13:47;13:54;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
13:54;13:57;"I was so overcome with emotion."
13:57;14:00;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:00;14:04;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:04;14:07;"Then you offered protection."
14:07;14:10;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:10;14:12;"Or am I back on my own?"
14:13;14:17;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
14:17;14:20;"I was so overcome with emotion."
14:20;14:23;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:23;14:27;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:27;14:30;"Then you offered protection."
14:30;14:33;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:33;14:37;"Or am I back on my own?"
14:37;14:41;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
14:41;14:44;"I was so overcome with emotion."
14:44;14:47;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:47;14:51;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:51;14:54;"Then you offered protection."
14:54;14:57;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:57;15:00;"Or am I back on my own?"
15:00;15:07;"So it was a good vibe there, and I would say that the Saturday morning show is my favorite."
15:07;15:12;"And actually, at that one, historically I think a lot of our shows would be like 80 minutes."
15:12;15:16;"Even on the third album, the Saturday morning show is two hours, two minutes."
15:16;15:17;"Strong."
15:17;15:18;"25 songs."
15:18;15:19;"That's strong."
15:19;15:20;"Including three A-Punks."
15:20;15:21;"It was a good vibe."
15:21;15:25;"We busted out our Paul Simon cover for the first time."
15:25;15:26;"Which one?"
15:26;15:27;"Late in the Evening."
15:27;15:28;"Do you know this song?"
15:28;15:29;"Oh yeah."
15:29;15:31;"[singing]"
15:31;15:32;"Yep."
15:32;15:35;"It was late in the evening, late in the evening."
15:35;15:36;"Yep."
15:36;15:37;"It was late in the evening."
15:37;15:38;"Yeah."
15:38;15:40;"Is that on the One Trick Pony album?"
15:40;15:41;"I think so."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:43;15:44;"It's kind of like a precursor to Graceland."
15:44;15:46;"Yeah, so all the shows went well."
15:46;15:48;"And we did like these radio sessions."
15:48;15:49;"We had to cover..."
15:49;15:50;"Full band?"
15:50;15:51;"Yeah, that was full band."
15:51;15:52;"That sounds hectic."
15:52;15:54;"We did kind of like a stripped-down Harmony Hall live."
15:54;15:59;"Oh, and then so there's this thing on Radio 1 in England called Live Lounge."
15:59;16:03;"You perform your song, and then you perform a cover of a current hit."
16:03;16:07;"Last time we did it, five, six years ago, we did Blurred Lines."
16:07;16:08;"Okay."
16:08;16:10;"A song that hasn't aged particularly well."
16:10;16:13;"But I was kind of like just thinking about like what is a hit now?"
16:13;16:14;"And I'm like..."
16:14;16:15;"Small Charcoal Grill."
16:15;16:18;"No, yeah, we were like we're going to do Seven Rings by Ariana Grande."
16:18;16:19;"They would have been like, brilliant."
16:19;16:20;"That's a huge hit."
16:20;16:21;"Awesome."
16:21;16:22;"That'll be a whole thing."
16:22;16:24;"Vampire Weekend covers Ariana Grande."
16:24;16:28;"That'll be something people click on for a day."
16:28;16:30;"Oh, people will click on that to make fun of you guys."
16:30;16:31;"That's awesome."
16:31;16:32;"Let's do it."
16:32;16:34;"And then I just get up there, and we start playing the beat."
16:34;16:36;"And then just for three and a half minutes, I just go,"
16:36;16:39;"""Small Charcoal Grill. Small Charcoal Grill."""
16:39;16:40;"That's live?"
16:40;16:41;"Yeah, just live on radio."
16:41;16:44;"They'd probably cut it and just be like, ""We are so sorry."
16:44;16:47;"This is so disrespectful to the Live Lounge Institution."""
16:47;16:49;"But anyway, I was talking to one of our managers, John."
16:49;16:55;"This test of the emergency broadcasting system."
16:55;16:56;"You were talking to?"
16:56;16:58;"John from our management company."
16:58;17:02;"At first, I was a little bit like, ""Oh, man, I feel a little old for that."""
17:02;17:03;"And I like it."
17:03;17:04;"It can be a good vibe."
17:04;17:05;"Sure."
17:05;17:06;"The host is super cool over there."
17:06;17:10;"But it's just one of those things where it's like it can easily go so wrong."
17:10;17:11;"Yeah."
17:11;17:13;"I just couldn't think of a pop song that would feel right."
17:13;17:15;"And I'm still not sure that we--"
17:15;17:17;"Was it something that's been in the top five of this show ever?"
17:17;17:18;"Oh, yeah."
17:18;17:19;"Hold on, hold on."
17:19;17:20;"I got to guess."
17:20;17:23;"So I'm just saying to him, I'm like, ""What song could Vampire Weekend cover?"
17:23;17:26;"We're just going to seem kind of awkward."""
17:26;17:30;"And he pitched one that at least I appreciated just because it was kind of funny"
17:30;17:33;"in terms of how it connected back to us."
17:33;17:34;"Sunflower?"
17:34;17:35;"Mm-hmm."
17:35;17:36;"Cool."
17:36;17:37;"Tough to do, though."
17:37;17:39;"Yeah, we did this kind of like--"
17:39;17:40;"Our version was kind of vibey."
17:40;17:44;"And we threw in some little teases to other songs."
17:44;17:47;"A little bit of China Cat, a little bit of Our Sunflower,"
17:47;17:48;"and a little bit of Harmony Hall."
17:48;17:49;"Sick."
17:49;17:50;"Just to drive the point home."
17:50;17:51;"I think it turned out all right."
17:51;17:54;"I'm not going to play it, but you guys can check it out online."
17:54;17:58;"So we did stuff like that, and then I just sat and did just days of press,"
17:58;17:59;"which is funny because--"
17:59;18:00;"Like in a hotel suite?"
18:00;18:01;"Classic, yeah."
18:01;18:02;"In a hotel suite."
18:02;18:03;"Oh, my God."
18:03;18:05;"I was so jet-lagged, too, but I was just like super high on coffee"
18:05;18:07;"just talking to people for like seven hours."
18:07;18:08;"Jesus."
18:08;18:11;"A lot of British journalists, a lot of European journalists come to London."
18:11;18:13;"Like some people fly in for the day to talk or they're based there."
18:13;18:14;"Wow."
18:14;18:15;"You know, German people and Belgian people."
18:15;18:17;"Oh, so it's all European press."
18:17;18:18;"Just about."
18:18;18:20;"There's somebody from Japan there."
18:20;18:22;"What percentage mentioned Time Crisis?"
18:22;18:23;"A few."
18:23;18:24;"Actually, it was funny."
18:24;18:25;"Like 25%?"
18:25;18:27;"Yeah, there was a cool guy from Ireland."
18:27;18:28;"He was funny."
18:28;18:29;"I appreciated it."
18:29;18:31;"He just like kicked it off with like maybe two non sequiturs kind of like"
18:31;18:32;"that weren't about the album."
18:32;18:35;"He was just like, ""It's very tempting to try to do this in an Irish accent,"
18:35;18:37;"but I won't out of respect."""
18:37;18:39;"He just like was like, ""All right, man."
18:39;18:42;"So seems like I got some kind of beef with the space cowboy."""
18:42;18:43;"And I was like, ""What?"""
18:43;18:45;"And he's like, ""Steve Miller, what's up with that?"""
18:45;18:46;"And I was like, ""Well."""
18:46;18:47;"He did his homework."
18:47;18:49;"Yeah, and talked about that."
18:49;18:54;"And then he said, ""I think I've played this on Time Crisis before."
18:54;18:58;"You know that we did like a reggae cover of Conte Partiro before?"""
18:58;18:59;"Yeah, I think this has come up."
18:59;19:01;"Wait, what is that song again?"
19:01;19:03;"It's like a pop opera song."
19:03;19:05;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yep."
19:05;19:07;"This is where I try to sing in Italian."
19:07;19:09;"So he was also funny."
19:09;19:12;"He said, ""You did this cover of Conte Partiro, huh?"""
19:12;19:13;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
19:13;19:15;"And he's like, ""Not your finest hour."
19:15;19:16;"What was up with that?"""
19:16;19:18;"I was like, ""Damn."""
19:18;19:20;"Okay, fair point."
19:20;19:23;"And I was like, ""Well, it was for a Starbucks compilation."""
19:23;19:25;"He was cool, though."
19:26;19:28;"[singing in Italian]"
19:31;19:57;"We gotta get to the chorus."
19:57;19:59;"[singing in Italian]"
19:59;20:02;"Sounds pretty good."
20:02;20:07;"I would argue this is Vampire Begins Finest Hour."
20:07;20:10;"I think the vocals are strong."
20:10;20:13;"I think the beat, not as."
20:13;20:16;"But you're holding it down with the foreign language, dude."
20:16;20:17;"Thank you."
20:17;20:20;"I'm not sure what a native Italian speaker would say."
20:20;20:24;"But it was interesting to also finally talk to people who have heard the album."
20:24;20:26;"That's pretty wild."
20:26;20:28;"To talk to strangers who have heard the album."
20:28;20:30;"I haven't had that experience yet."
20:30;20:33;"I'm only interested in people that want to talk about time crisis."
20:33;20:34;"Yeah."
20:34;20:36;"Well, let me think of anybody that's been in a time crisis."
20:36;20:38;"No, but like I said, there was a lot of that."
20:38;20:40;"Just like, ""So you've been keeping real busy."""
20:40;20:41;"I always think about that, too."
20:41;20:43;"That's a four-hour-a-week-- four-hour-a-month commitment."
20:43;20:47;"I always think about that, because that's such a classic cliche of music writing."
20:47;20:50;"I guess they're trying to be charitable when people are just talking about--"
20:50;20:53;"Somebody's been gone, but they've been keeping real busy."
20:53;20:57;"As a music industry professional, I look at the list, and I'm always kind of like--"
20:57;21:01;"It's never just like, ""Drove a truck for Walmart for two years."""
21:01;21:07;"It's always like, ""From hosting their own podcast to recording three songs with another producer"
21:07;21:09;"to acting in a TV show for a week."""
21:09;21:11;"The past seven years have been--"
21:11;21:12;"It's always like that."
21:12;21:14;"And then that's when you go super Jim Morrison."
21:14;21:17;"You're like, ""What's up with this obsession with keeping busy?"""
21:17;21:21;"I resent this idea that I kept busy, let alone that I should keep busy."
21:21;21:22;"I did not keep busy."
21:22;21:25;"I actually just stared at a tree for a full year."
21:25;21:27;"Yeah, I watched television."
21:27;21:29;"I watched a lot of reality television."
21:29;21:31;"I let it wash over me."
21:31;21:34;"I ordered from Wingstop on Uber Eats."
21:34;21:35;"Gained a lot of weight."
21:35;21:36;"I gained a lot of weight."
21:36;21:39;"I watched YouTube videos and not tutorials."
21:50;21:52;"So people who had heard the album--"
21:52;21:55;"That was kind of interesting, although I did find that--"
21:55;21:59;"It is funny, too, when you talk to so many people, you almost start to develop talking points"
21:59;22:00;"over the course of a week."
22:00;22:01;"Sure."
22:01;22:02;"Because at first--"
22:02;22:03;"[laughs]"
22:03;22:07;"That makes me immediately think of, ""There's 100 people in the room."""
22:07;22:09;"Oh, yeah, yeah. I have more sympathy for her after that."
22:09;22:10;"Sure."
22:10;22:13;"I at least try to keep it real when I'm talking to people."
22:13;22:15;"Also, it's very artificial, and I think the journalists know that, too."
22:15;22:21;"Although I will point out that there are some profiles of people, like a written profile,"
22:21;22:25;"where legitimately they gave access to the person for weeks."
22:25;22:27;"They were shadowed somebody for weeks."
22:27;22:29;"That's wild. Like a Long New Yorker profile?"
22:29;22:30;"A Long New Yorker profile."
22:30;22:33;"Let's say at a Long New Yorker profile, they minimum spent 10 hours with the person,"
22:33;22:34;"even if it's spread out."
22:34;22:35;"Yeah."
22:35;22:37;"A lot of these interviews, you sit down for like 20 minutes."
22:37;22:38;"Right."
22:38;22:42;"I also found that that's a funny cliche of music writing sometimes is like--"
22:42;22:46;"And you got a feel for the writers, and I know some people who do this for a living."
22:46;22:49;"And I didn't even think about it until I started doing it, too,"
22:49;22:55;"but it's that vibe of kind of just like, ""I sat down with Lady Gaga at the Bowery Hotel in New York."
22:55;22:58;"She ordered a chamomile tea with honey."""
22:58;23:02;"And they try to pull these details out as if that's a place she was like unguarded."
23:02;23:05;"""Won't you come meet me at the Bowery Hotel?"
23:05;23:08;"This is where I can be myself and order the things that I like."""
23:08;23:12;"There was like an infamous profile years ago where this woman really tried to take down MIA,"
23:12;23:16;"and the whole thing was like, ""I sat down with her at the Beverly Hills Hotel,"
23:16;23:17;"and she ordered truffle fries."""
23:17;23:21;"It became this thing because she was trying to say MIA is not a woman of the people."
23:21;23:23;"She got that decadent truffle."
23:23;23:24;"And then the most hilarious part is--"
23:24;23:25;"Very fragrant flavor."
23:25;23:29;"--later the tape came out, and the woman says to her like, ""You want to order some food?"""
23:29;23:31;"And she's like, ""Yeah, I'm a little hungry."""
23:31;23:33;"And she's like, ""The truffle fries here are unbelievable."""
23:33;23:35;"[explosion]"
23:35;23:37;"So it's like so extra."
23:37;23:38;"That's brutal."
23:38;23:42;"But I'm saying even if MIA ordered the truffle fries, this is like a totally artificial situation."
23:42;23:43;"Yeah."
23:43;23:45;"Plus it's on brand for MIA."
23:45;23:46;"To order truffle fries?"
23:46;23:47;"Absolutely."
23:47;23:48;"I guess this person didn't feel that way."
23:48;23:50;"It's outrageous. It's decadent."
23:50;23:51;"Is that--"
23:51;23:52;"I don't know."
23:52;23:57;"I'm just like-- if I'm guessing, if you were like, ""Jake, what kind of fries would MIA order?"
23:57;23:58;"Sweet potato?"""
23:58;23:59;"Yeah."
23:59;24:01;"Regular? Crinkle cut? Or truffle?"
24:01;24:02;"Yeah."
24:02;24:03;"I'd go with truffle."
24:03;24:05;"Crinkle cut."
24:05;24:07;"Tater tots?"
24:07;24:13;"I'd actually say if you sit down with a journalist at a fancy hotel, it's actually more extra to ask for a crinkle cut."
24:13;24:14;"Yeah."
24:14;24:17;"Could someone go out and buy a bag of Ore-Ida frozen crinkle cut?"
24:17;24:21;"The poor waiter, ""Ma'am, we serve truffle fries here. This is a fancy restaurant."""
24:21;24:25;"""Well, I'm just a normal person, man. I want some crinkle cut."""
24:25;24:28;"""It would be much easier for me if you just ordered the truffle fries."
24:28;24:31;"We have a whole system. They're always making them around the clock."""
24:31;24:34;"I'm sure that actually-- not quite that, but I'm sure that has actually happened in some way."
24:34;24:40;"Like, a person with working class roots who now is clearly rich and famous sits down with a journalist at a fancy restaurant"
24:40;24:46;"and tries to have some moment of class solidarity with the waiter that just makes the waiter's job way harder."
24:46;24:47;"Oh."
24:47;24:48;"Inadvertently."
24:48;24:51;"""Hey, bro. Let me get a beer."""
24:51;24:55;"""Um, all right, sir. We have a-- on tap, we have a Hefeweizen."""
24:55;24:58;"""No, man. A regular beer. You know, like guys like us drink."""
24:58;25:00;"""You got like a Budweiser or a Miller Lite?"""
25:00;25:02;"""Uh, no, we don't have that. Come on, man."""
25:02;25:04;"""We have a Stella Artois and a Peroni."""
25:04;25:08;"""I'm a regular guy like you, man. I don't want no fancy Belgian beer."""
25:08;25:10;"""Just fetch me up a Budweiser back there."""
25:10;25:12;"""Sir, we don't have that. Oh, come on, man. Figure it out."""
25:12;25:18;"And like, the guy's like sweating. He's like, ""Uh, Bradley Cooper just said that we need to get a Budweiser."""
25:18;25:21;"""Okay, okay. Um, run to the corner store."""
25:21;25:24;"And it's like, the guy like comes back. He's like, ""See, man? We're normal guys."""
25:24;25:29;"But then he's like, ""Okay, can I get like a card for the-- you know, like a restaurant card to cover the Bud?"""
25:29;25:34;"And the manager's like, ""No, no, just go. Just pay it for yourself. We'll reimburse you. It'll be in your next check."""
25:34;25:36;"Of course, that doesn't happen."
25:36;25:43;"So then the waiter ends up buying an overpriced six-pack of Bud, never reimbursed."
25:43;25:46;"No tip either."
25:46;25:52;"Oh, hell no. 'Cause it's on some weird company card. The publicist like signs for it, doesn't tip."
25:52;25:56;"New York Times Magazine cover story. Bradley Cooper, man of the people."
25:56;26:00;"Tell me something, girl."
26:00;26:04;"Actually, I'm sorry I said Bradley Cooper."
26:04;26:06;"That's more like a kid rock move."
26:06;26:07;"That was not a B. Coop's move."
26:07;26:08;"No."
26:08;26:09;"He is who he is."
26:09;26:10;"So you're sitting down with these people."
26:10;26:15;"And it was mostly cool, but sometimes I just felt-- at least I had the language now to be clear about it when people would ask me,"
26:15;26:20;"it's like, ""What's this album about?"" And I did say a few times, I was like, ""You know, I'm not always good at explaining what the album's about."""
26:20;26:24;"Like, I have more clarity on the last album now. I could probably describe more."
26:24;26:25;"Sure, sure."
26:25;26:28;"I can look back and say, ""Well, this is the state of mind I was in. I was probably trying to accomplish this."
26:28;26:32;"This album, I can kind of guess about how it's different and stuff."""
26:32;26:36;"And sometimes they ask me about specific songs, and I just feel a little bad, but I'm just like,"
26:36;26:40;"I don't want there to be an article dropping concurrent with the album, let alone weeks before."
26:40;26:41;"Right."
26:41;26:46;"Where it's kind of just like breaking down songs people haven't heard and then they hear it with-- and I don't even always know the answer."
26:46;26:49;"So then what do you say? You're like, ""I don't know, man. Can we, you know?"""
26:49;26:55;"Well, sometimes people be specifically like, ""Is it about this?"" And I'll just be kind of like, ""It's not not about that."""
26:55;27:02;"I just-- so sometimes I just be very straightforward and say, like, ""I did have something specific in mind, but I don't want to overly contextualize it."""
27:02;27:08;"And I said, ""Listen, for better or for worse, I don't like to contextualize stuff before the fans hear it."""
27:08;27:13;"There might be times where that's cool because it leaves the song open and people can approach it."
27:13;27:17;"There might be times where a song might have benefited from some contextualization."
27:17;27:20;"I don't know. Those are just the rules that I play by."
27:20;27:21;"Pretty gym of you, dude."

28:15;28:17;"You're listening to..."
28:17;28:19;"Time Crisis"
28:19;28:21;"On Beat One"
28:21;28:25;"Anyway, we just dropped a couple new singles."
28:25;28:27;"The final batch before the album."
28:27;28:28;"Okay, let's get into it."
28:28;28:32;"I guess now that the song's been out for a few days, I can contextualize them at least a little bit."
28:32;28:34;"So I guess kind of like the A-side..."
28:34;28:36;"I don't really think of these as A-side, B-side."
28:36;28:41;"Of course, there's ones that are naturally going to get a little more attention or push at radio,"
28:41;28:43;"but to me, they're all equal."
28:43;28:45;"The last batch definitely felt that way."
28:45;28:49;"With like their both short songs, it could have gone either way."
28:49;28:50;"Obviously, Harmony Hall is like..."
28:50;28:51;"That's like the single."
28:51;28:53;"The major work of the first two."
28:53;28:56;"Yeah, and also as I discussed, like the last batch is kind of like..."
28:56;28:59;"That's kind of like the funky batch a little bit."
28:59;29:02;"It'd be interesting to see when people hear the whole album what they rank the songs."
29:02;29:05;"But this is a song called ""This Life,"" which..."
29:05;29:09;"This life has taken control of me."
29:09;29:13;"So fun fact, people might not know this yet, this is a TC exclusive."
29:13;29:15;"Jake, you play on this song."
29:15;29:16;"Really?"
29:16;29:17;"Yeah."
29:17;29:18;"Okay."
29:18;29:19;"You probably don't even remember."
29:19;29:20;"I do."
29:20;29:21;"I mean, I remember..."
29:21;29:22;"You remember being in the studio."
29:22;29:24;"I remember going in the studio and playing guitar over songs I'd never heard before."
29:24;29:25;"Yeah."
29:25;29:26;"And just sort of doing some guesswork."
29:26;29:27;"Yeah."
29:27;29:28;"And maybe getting lucky a few times."
29:28;29:29;"You got lucky on this one."
29:29;29:30;"Cool."
29:30;29:32;"Does John play on this one too?"
29:32;29:34;"No, John plays on ""Stranger."""
29:34;29:35;"Oh."
29:35;29:41;"The two guitars from Dick Picks, Richard Pictures, appear on ""Father of the Bride."""
29:41;29:43;"Oh yeah, this one."
29:43;29:48;"I haven't heard this stuff in like a long time."
29:48;29:51;"There are a lot of versions of this song too."
29:52;29:55;"I know pain is as natural as the rain."
29:55;30:00;"I just thought it didn't rain in California."
30:00;30:06;"Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was."
30:06;30:11;"'Cause I've never known a love like this before."
30:11;30:13;"Oh, yeah."
30:18;30:23;"Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes."
30:23;30:29;"I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer."
30:29;30:35;"There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand."
30:35;30:40;"We're surviving, we're still living, all stronger."
30:40;30:53;"You've been cheating on me."
30:53;30:55;"Surprisingly unpolished."
30:55;30:56;"Unpolished?"
30:56;30:57;"Yeah."
30:57;30:59;"Well, we'll talk about it more."
30:59;31:02;"I needed this song to be a little unpolished."
31:02;31:06;"But I've been cheating through this life."
31:06;31:10;"I remember you guys now driving yourself crazy with all these different versions."
31:10;31:12;"Yeah."
31:12;31:13;"I dig it, man."
31:13;31:14;"Thank you."
31:14;31:18;"Oh, Christ."
31:18;31:25;"Am I good for nothing?"
31:25;31:30;"Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate."
31:30;31:36;"I just thought we'd lock the gate when we left in the morning."
31:36;31:41;"And I was told that walk is how we landed on these shows."
31:41;31:47;"I just thought the drums would be louder warnings."
31:47;31:48;"Ooh, ooh."
31:48;31:55;"Ooh, ooh."
31:55;31:56;"Sweet."
31:59;32:01;"You've been cheating on, cheating on me."
32:01;32:04;"I've been cheating on, cheating on you."
32:04;32:05;"Very light saxophone."
32:05;32:07;"You've been cheating on me."
32:07;32:08;"I thought it was a harmonica."
32:08;32:09;"I've been cheating through this life."
32:09;32:10;"Oh, that sounds fun."
32:10;32:13;"I've been cheating on, cheating on me."
32:13;32:20;"And all of a sudden, I've been cheating through the roof."
32:20;32:21;"Oh, Christ."
32:21;32:23;"You've been cheating on me."
32:23;32:24;"Oh, Christ."
32:24;32:26;"Am I good for nothing?"
32:26;32:32;"I'm pretty into when songs use the word ""Oh, Christ."""
32:32;32:34;"Go big or go home."
32:34;32:35;"Yeah."
32:35;32:36;"You know what I'm saying?"
32:36;32:42;"'Cause I don't remember living life before this."
32:42;32:46;"Darling, our disease is the same one."
32:46;32:47;"All right, guys."
32:47;32:48;"Who's singing there with you?"
32:48;32:49;"Daniel."
32:49;32:50;"OK, cool."
32:50;32:51;"Here comes Jakes."
32:51;32:52;"Jakes on the solo."
32:52;32:53;"Uh-oh."
32:58;32:59;"OK."
33:02;33:03;"That's it."
33:03;33:04;"OK."
33:04;33:05;"I've been playing that a lot."
33:05;33:07;"That sounds very meandering."
33:07;33:09;"Like, what key is this?"
33:09;33:11;"That's what that sounds like."
33:11;33:14;"Hey, I'm thrilled to be on the record."
33:14;33:15;"Wait, hold on."
33:15;33:16;"Let's rewind."
33:16;33:17;"Glad that worked out."
33:20;33:21;"I think it's very tasteful."
33:21;33:22;"It doesn't sound calculated."
33:22;33:24;"That's for sure."
33:24;33:27;"'Cause also, normally we were doing that da-da-da-da-da-da."
33:27;33:29;"So it's like we wanted to break from that."
33:29;33:32;"So we wanted, you know, instead of going back to that big guitar part,"
33:32;33:33;"let's go like here."
33:40;33:41;"That's really funny."
33:41;33:42;"Got a lot of phase on it."
33:44;33:46;"I think we just did one pass."
33:46;33:49;"I mean, I can hear myself guessing."
33:49;33:50;"Like, is this third?"
33:50;33:54;"Like, is this a half step or a full step here?"
33:54;33:55;"I don't even."
34:23;34:26;"I'm surprised by the bass tone."
34:26;34:28;"Ooh."
34:28;34:29;"Is there another bass that comes in there?"
34:29;34:30;"Yeah, yeah."
34:30;34:33;"I think 'cause we did a whole pass of fretless."
34:33;34:34;"Okay, nice."
34:34;34:39;"We had this one, this like shredder dude who's on the album a bit named Jimmy Johnson."
34:39;34:42;"He's a James Taylor's touring bassist among other things."
34:42;34:43;"How old is he?"
34:43;34:44;"I think 60s."
34:44;34:45;"Wow."
34:45;34:48;"How many people over the age of 50 play on the record?"
34:48;34:49;"Two come to mind."
34:49;34:50;"Maybe just two."
34:50;34:51;"The like pedal steel--"
34:51;34:52;"Greg Lees, who you met before."
34:52;34:54;"He plays a lot on it, right?"
34:54;34:55;"Yeah."
34:55;34:58;"Like he plays the like solo on Harmony Hall."
34:58;34:59;"Yeah."
34:59;35:00;"And we also just play his guitar."
35:00;35:01;"Yeah."
35:01;35:02;"Actually, I was looking through old videos."
35:02;35:03;"Check this out."
35:03;35:07;"I remember meeting him and him talking about like seeing like Graham Parsons and stuff."
35:07;35:08;"Yeah, no, he's a true legend."
35:08;35:12;"Just like, oh yeah, Gene Clark was a hell of a guy."
35:12;35:13;"Just like--"
35:13;35:15;"I was looking for old videos the other day."
35:15;35:17;"I just ended up so deep in my phone."
35:17;35:21;"I just wanted to send you a funny one of us, of like us hiking in Hawaii."
35:21;35:22;"Oh, you and I."
35:22;35:24;"Yeah, no, it's like you and I."
35:24;35:26;"Well, actually, now I kind of want to play this."
35:26;35:27;"I was so deep on my phone."
35:27;35:28;"Well, okay."
35:28;35:29;"Dude, you are."
35:29;35:30;"That's really deep on your phone."
35:30;35:32;"No, because I have everything on--"
35:32;35:34;"So deep on my phone."
35:34;35:35;"Wait, check this out."
35:35;35:39;"This is like a six-second video that I clearly was just trying to film the vista--"
35:39;35:40;"Yeah."
35:40;35:42;"--of us hiking on the Nepali coast, and then I just caught this."
35:42;35:44;"--of the gods."
35:44;35:47;"Wackest title."
35:47;35:48;"That's right."
35:48;35:51;"You're describing the book that you're reading to Rashida."
35:51;35:53;"Wait, one more time."
35:53;35:55;"--of the gods."
35:55;35:57;"Wackest title."
35:57;35:59;"Also, look at the actual video."
35:59;36:01;"It's like a breathtaking view."
36:01;36:02;"I mean, that's just what happens when you hike."
36:02;36:06;"It's like a breathtaking view, and you guys are just having this convo."
36:06;36:08;"--of the gods."
36:08;36:11;"Wackest title."
36:11;36:12;"Oh, my God."
36:12;36:13;"So what's actually in the book?"
36:13;36:15;"I think it's maybe Fingerprints of the Gods."
36:15;36:19;"And it's kind of like conspiracy theory, ancient aliens kind of thing?"
36:19;36:22;"Not aliens."
36:22;36:24;"God, I don't even remember."
36:24;36:26;"Graham Hancock's full-- or maybe it wasn't Fingerprints."
36:26;36:29;"I was reading the follow-up to Fingerprints of the Gods."
36:29;36:31;"I don't know why I was reading that."
36:31;36:36;"His big thing is sort of like the pyramids are actually way older than people think they are."
36:36;36:40;"This is some real Joe Rogan podcast kind of stuff."
36:40;36:43;"The reason I was thinking about this video is I found this video of Greg Lee's."
36:43;36:46;"We were doing this whole crazy pedal steel version."
36:54;36:56;"We'll drop in extended versions."
36:56;36:57;"Oh, this is cool."
37:00;37:03;"I just started to feel like--"
37:03;37:05;"Oh, this is just him on loop."
37:05;37:07;"How far back does your phone go?"
37:07;37:08;"Pretty far."
37:08;37:09;"Damn."
37:09;37:11;"This is July 2017."
37:11;37:14;"But that Hawaii trip was--"
37:14;37:15;"2016?"
37:15;37:17;"No, I want to say '15."
37:17;37:18;"Oh, that's possible."
37:18;37:19;"Yeah, that's crazy."
37:19;37:22;"Yeah, there was a version of that song that I just started to think was felt too played out"
37:22;37:24;"that had the--"
37:24;37:27;"you know, kind of like tropical reggaeton groove."
37:27;37:29;"I think I was always self-conscious about this song."
37:29;37:34;"I can say it now that it's out, where I just wondered if it was just too normal."
37:34;37:35;"Just like too straightforward?"
37:35;37:36;"What do you mean?"
37:36;37:37;"Yeah, too straightforward."
37:37;37:40;"And maybe this is part of growing older and not being so try-hard."
37:40;37:45;"It doesn't have an obvious Vampire Weekend signature contrasting element."
37:45;37:46;"Right."
37:46;37:49;"Does Harmony Hall-- that's pretty straightforward too."
37:49;37:53;"Yeah, but Harmony Hall has the contrast of kind of like the classic rock guitar"
37:53;37:55;"into the house piano."
37:55;37:56;"Oh, yeah, no, that's true."
37:56;37:58;"The house piano, when it drops in, that's--"
37:58;38:00;"And this one, I'm just like-- it has its cool moments,"
38:00;38:03;"like when the chorus-y or the tremolo vocals."
38:03;38:04;"Right, right."
38:04;38:08;"So I think it has cool elements, but it is just kind of like a real song."
38:08;38:12;"And I think I also felt like-- I'm curious how people perceive it."
38:12;38:16;"It's also a song that I think-- it's one of those deceptively simple songs."
38:16;38:21;"Some songs telegraph the fact that this is an important song, it's epic."
38:21;38:23;"This one is-- it kind of comes across light."
38:23;38:25;"[singing]"
38:25;38:27;"And I also felt like-- I really like the lyrics,"
38:27;38:29;"but the whole time we were working on this song, I was always like,"
38:29;38:34;"""Oh, I know somebody's going to hear these lyrics and be like, 'That's stupid.'"""
38:34;38:37;"Walk me through the lyrics, if you care to."
38:37;38:40;"I mean, I've been cheating on you."
38:40;38:43;"Oh, by the way, that part is by Makonnen, a friend of the show."
38:43;38:44;"I love Makonnen."
38:44;38:47;"And that was from this demo of his that I always loved,"
38:47;38:49;"and then he was cool with us."
38:49;38:51;"So he's credited as a writer on the song."
38:51;38:53;"So is Mark Ronson, wrote the bass line."
38:53;38:56;"But Makonnen had this song, ""You've been cheating on, cheating on me."""
38:56;38:58;"I just always liked-- well, first of all, I know there's going to be some people"
38:58;39:01;"who maybe would be thrown that there's a Vampire Weekend song"
39:01;39:04;"that even talks about cheating, but I was kind of like, ""It's time."""
39:04;39:05;"Just for a real--"
39:05;39:07;"Just because you're a very wholesome, family-friendly band?"
39:07;39:11;"Oh, no, I just feel like because it's just too real, almost."
39:11;39:14;"It's not like a high, Baroque-style Vampire Weekend."
39:14;39:18;"It's not an overtly emotional band, historically."
39:18;39:21;"This song also-- it's even opposed to Harmony Hall."
39:21;39:24;"It doesn't have some of those big words."
39:24;39:26;"It's less vague, in a way."
39:26;39:28;"It's kind of a direct, real-life thing."
39:28;39:29;"It's like a country song."
39:29;39:33;"I always liked that Makonnen thing, where it's like two people cheating on each other."
39:33;39:38;"But the opening lines are, ""Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain."
39:38;39:40;"I just thought it didn't rain in California."""
39:40;39:42;"That's a good lyric, dude."
39:42;39:43;"I really like that lyric."
39:43;39:44;"That's one of those ones where I--"
39:44;39:45;"It's very Joni."
39:45;39:46;"Oh, really?"
39:46;39:47;"I think."
39:47;39:50;"I mean, she would connect her personal, emotional journeys"
39:50;39:52;"with the geographies that she's in, for sure."
39:52;39:55;"I just wonder if it's one of those-- and now here I am contextualizing it,"
39:55;39:58;"but the song's already out, so it's different."
39:58;40:00;"It's almost like as I get older-- and you know, like,"
40:00;40:02;"early Vampire Weekend, Oxford, Common Mansory,"
40:02;40:06;"there's a line like that where I'm like, ""That is a truly good line to me."""
40:06;40:08;"It doesn't have any expensive words or anything,"
40:08;40:12;"and it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's a little funny."
40:12;40:14;"That's kind of like a country lyric, too."
40:14;40:15;"Oh, for sure."
40:15;40:18;"♪ Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain."
40:18;40:20;"I just thought it didn't rain in California. ♪"
40:20;40:21;"Yeah."
40:21;40:25;"I can picture Merle Haggard or George Jones singing that."
40:25;40:28;"And also, in terms of-- obviously, there's some songs on the album"
40:28;40:31;"where I did apply my stringent logic to it, and I was like,"
40:31;40:34;"""The song is about somebody who's kind of like a dope"
40:34;40:37;"and finally hits a moment in life where they realize"
40:37;40:39;"they've got to look through their whole life."""
40:39;40:41;"And it's not just about that tit for tat,"
40:41;40:43;"""You've been cheating on me, I've been cheating on you."""
40:43;40:45;"It's like, ""Maybe I've been cheating through my whole life."""
40:45;40:48;"So I like opening the song with the vibe of just,"
40:48;40:50;"""Yeah, I know that everybody goes through pain in life."
40:50;40:53;"It's as natural as the rain, but I didn't think it would happen to me."
40:53;40:55;"I live here in California."""
40:55;40:56;"So then where's it go?"
40:56;40:58;"♪ Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was"
40:58;41:01;"'Cause I never known a love like this before you ♪"
41:01;41:02;"Straightforward."
41:02;41:04;"The second verse is the one that I find the most--"
41:04;41:06;"I wonder what people make of it."
41:06;41:09;"That's, ""Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate"
41:09;41:11;"I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning"
41:11;41:15;"I was told that war is how we landed on these shores"
41:15;41:17;"I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings."""
41:17;41:18;"Damn."
41:18;41:20;"Well, that's when it goes dark, but I also thought that--"
41:20;41:21;"That's good, though."
41:21;41:23;"The phrase ""I was told"" I thought was also really funny"
41:23;41:27;"'cause I didn't exactly take it from this, but it made me think of--"
41:27;41:29;"Do you remember there's this famous YouTube video"
41:29;41:32;"of a woman yelling at the Apple store, and she's yelling,"
41:32;41:33;"""I was told by AppleCare""?"
41:33;41:34;"No."
41:34;41:36;"So it's just something about ""I was told"""
41:36;41:40;"that really also fit my vision of the narrator of the song."
41:40;41:44;"Well, yeah, it seems like he has received wisdom that he's accepted,"
41:44;41:46;"and now he's like, real stuff's happening in his life,"
41:46;41:49;"and he's completely caught off guard by it."
41:49;41:50;"Right."
41:50;41:52;"Just like sometimes you roll up to the Apple store,"
41:52;41:54;"you're told by AppleCare."
41:54;41:55;"I was told."
41:55;41:56;"I don't want to go too much further."
41:56;41:57;"I still want people to have their fun--"
41:57;41:58;"Tight song."
41:58;41:59;"--digging into the song."
41:59;42:00;"But yeah, that's--"
42:00;42:02;"Thrilled that my little lick made it on there, dude."
42:02;42:04;"I think that's a very strong lick."
42:04;42:06;"Actually, this song in rehearsal has become actually one of my favorite"
42:06;42:07;"to play live."
42:07;42:08;"It's a really good vibe."
42:08;42:09;"That's cool."
42:09;42:10;"Yeah."
42:10;42:12;"And then I wonder if you remember the other one."
42:12;42:13;"I'm curious."
42:13;42:15;"I haven't-- 'cause it's 18 songs on the record?"
42:15;42:16;"Yeah."
42:16;42:18;"I have not heard 18 songs."
42:18;42:20;"I mean, I've heard maybe 10."
42:20;42:24;"Well, we're going to get into it when we prerecord our album time capsule episode."
42:24;42:25;"I'm really excited for that episode."
42:25;42:29;"So I think the basic idea just for the TC Eds is obviously me and Jake got a lot of"
42:29;42:31;"prerecording to do over the next month."
42:31;42:33;"Got to bank a lot of Eps."
42:33;42:37;"Banking Eps."
42:37;42:41;"You know, April of 2019 is going to surpass the four-hour-a-month workload"
42:41;42:42;"that we're usually--"
42:42;42:43;"That's true."
42:43;42:44;"--waited by."
42:44;42:47;"We're going to be looking at like maybe a six- to eight-hour work month."
42:47;42:49;"Next time I do an interview and somebody says,"
42:49;42:52;"""So you were keeping real busy over the past six years with your radio show."""
42:52;42:54;"I'll say, ""Man, I wasn't keeping busy."""
42:54;42:55;"I don't know what busy is."
42:55;42:58;"Try banking six Eps in one month."
42:58;43:00;"No, I'm recording four hours a month."
43:00;43:01;"That's nothing."
43:01;43:05;"You know what's hard work is banking Eps, and I've been banking some Eps, brother."
43:05;43:12;"Bank between 10 and 15 hours of content in a month with no planning."
43:12;43:16;"Yeah, so anyway, just so the TC Eds know, the idea is that the weekend the album"
43:16;43:19;"comes out, the album comes out May 3rd, which is a Friday,"
43:19;43:21;"so then there's a TC that Sunday."
43:21;43:26;"So that's the weekend we're going to drop me and Jake's album time capsule"
43:26;43:29;"where I play you the whole album, I talk about it,"
43:29;43:32;"maybe even imagine how people might react to this and that."
43:32;43:33;"I guess what we did is--"
43:33;43:34;"Conan, there's--"
43:34;43:36;"We did a small taste of it now."
43:36;43:37;"Oh, this is--"
43:37;43:38;"Me asking probing questions."
43:38;43:40;"Banking the Eps."
43:40;43:42;"We're banking the Eps."
43:42;43:44;"So this is the other single."
43:44;43:46;"This is the other song that came out."
43:46;43:48;"This is the one that a few people asked me about where they were just like"
43:48;43:50;"really wanted to know,"
43:50;43:52;"what is this song about, can you speak to it,"
43:52;43:56;"and I was just a little like, not really."
43:56;43:57;"Come on, man."
43:57;43:58;"What's this one called?"
43:58;43:59;"Unbearably White."
43:59;44:00;"Oh, I remember this one."
44:00;44:01;"I think that's why--"
44:01;44:03;"This uses the line unbearably buff."
44:03;44:04;"Oh, yeah."
44:04;44:06;"This is kind of like the Jake batch when I think about it."
44:06;44:07;"Yeah, this is--"
44:07;44:09;"Got Jake on guitar and then we got the word buff in this song."
44:09;44:10;"Yeah."
44:10;44:11;"Beats one."
44:11;44:15;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
44:15;44:20;"Baby, I love you, but that's not enough"
44:20;44:25;"And pulling away has been unbearably buff"
44:25;44:26;"Boom."
44:26;44:30;"I ran up the mountain out of your sight"
44:30;44:36;"The snow on the peak was just unbearably white"
44:46;44:51;"The city was freezing, an elegant flow"
44:51;44:56;"The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold"
44:56;45:01;"You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write"
45:01;45:07;"The page in your notebook was unbearably white"
45:07;45:12;"There's an avalanche coming"
45:12;45:17;"Don't cover your eyes"
45:17;45:22;"It's what you thought that you wanted"
45:22;45:27;"It's still a surprise"
45:27;45:32;"It's hot on the body"
45:32;45:37;"It's hot on the mind"
45:37;45:42;"To learn what kept us together, darling"
45:42;45:47;"Is what kept us alive"
46:03;46:05;"What's that instrument? That's a cool tone."
46:05;46:07;"It's not a guitar. It's like some--"
46:07;46:08;"I don't want to give away a secret."
46:08;46:09;"Okay."
46:09;46:10;"Blood Pop put something together."
46:10;46:12;"The story gets told"
46:12;46:17;"To tell it myself would be unbearably bold"
46:17;46:22;"Presented with darkness, we turn to the light"
46:22;46:28;"Could have been smart with just unbearably bright"
46:39;46:44;"There's an avalanche coming"
46:44;46:49;"Don't cover your eyes"
46:49;46:54;"It's what you thought that you wanted"
46:54;46:59;"It's still a surprise"
46:59;47:04;"It's hot on the body"
47:04;47:09;"It's hot on the mind"
47:09;47:14;"To learn what kept us together, darling"
47:14;47:19;"Is what kept us alive"
47:29;47:34;"Call it a day, call it a night"
47:34;47:39;"Careless and cold and just unbearably wild"
47:39;47:44;"Call it a day, call it a night"
47:44;47:49;"Careless and cold and just unbearably wild"
47:49;47:54;"Call it a day, call it a night"
47:54;47:59;"Careless and cold and just unbearably wild"
47:59;48:04;"Baby, I love you, but that's not enough"
48:04;48:09;"And in a way, it's just unbearably wild"
48:09;48:14;"I'd rather be melting out of your side"
48:14;48:19;"It's not me, it's just unbearably wild"
48:19;48:22;"Call it a day, call it a night"
48:22;48:25;"There you go. Unbearably Wild."
48:25;48:31;"Provocative title. I can see why people, um, journalists would be like, ""What is that song about?"""
48:31;48:37;"Well, one thing that I talked about a lot with them is, 'cause some of them are like, ""Oh, is this a response to, like, something that was written about Vampire Weekend?"""
48:37;48:47;"And this is something that I checked a while ago, 'cause I had the phrase in my head for a while, and I remember seeing articles that were called, like, the unbearable
whiteness of whatever."
48:47;48:50;"Of Jonathan Safra Four, or whatever."
48:50;48:57;"Which, for anybody who doesn't know, is a play on the title of the novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being."
48:57;49:03;"So, I wondered, but it's not some thing where, like, I sat down and I was like, ""Oh, I wanna, this is a response to an article."""
49:03;49:05;"You know, sometimes I just start with, like, a phrase."
49:05;49:06;"Sure, sure."
49:06;49:09;"And it wasn't even unbearable whiteness, that's obviously very specifically about something."
49:09;49:12;"The phrase ""unbearably white"" actually seemed a little more open."
49:12;49:13;"Yeah."
49:13;49:14;"And, uh, fertile to me."
49:14;49:21;"But then, you know, I write this whole song, and then at some point I'm thinking about it, I'm like, ""Maybe I should check that I'm not, like, responding to one thing in
particular."""
49:21;49:23;"And so I looked up ""The Unbearable Whiteness of..."""
49:23;49:24;"Yeah."
49:24;49:28;"And not only... I found two different articles that referenced Vampire Weekend."
49:28;49:32;"They weren't about Vampire Weekend, but there was a minimum two, ten years apart."
49:32;49:36;"And then there were, like, hundreds of just articles, period."
49:36;49:43;"So not only was it not, like, one article in particular, it's like such a kind of, ""Oh my god, there's just a new one, two days ago."""
49:43;49:46;"""The Unbearable Whiteness of Being Beto O'Rourke."""
49:46;49:50;"""The Unbearable Whiteness of Milk."""
49:50;49:55;"So I guess my point is, and again, this is something I looked up after I wrote the song, so I wasn't even responding to this, but..."
49:55;49:56;"Yeah."
49:56;49:59;"""The Unbearable Whiteness of Urban Farming,"" ""The Unbearable Whiteness of the American Left."""
49:59;50:01;"My point is just that the, um..."
50:01;50:02;"Jesus Christ."
50:02;50:12;"If any journalist wrote an ""Unbearable Whiteness"" article that referenced Vampire Weekend, please keep in mind, there are literally ten ""Unbearable Whiteness""
articles written every day."
50:12;50:13;"I'm not gonna respond to you."
50:13;50:15;"That's all I have to say about that."
50:15;50:21;"I mean, I like how you play with it. It's like a snowy, uh, mountaintop. It's a sheet of paper."
50:21;50:23;"Well, yeah, I like the page in the notebook."
50:23;50:26;"I feel like there's one journalist who asked me, like, ""So is this about race?"""
50:26;50:28;"And I was like, ""Well, I think about things besides..."""
50:28;50:31;"""This would be, like, a good one to talk about in six months or something."""
50:31;50:32;"It's just like..."
50:32;50:33;"What about in, like, two weeks?"
50:33;50:34;"Maybe in two weeks."
50:34;50:36;"We'll do a deep dive on this song."
50:36;50:41;"I understand that, what you said, that it's like a provocative title, but I think when you hear the song..."
50:41;50:42;"Yeah, no, it does..."
50:42;50:44;"I don't think it's a provocative lyric."
50:44;50:47;"No. I mean, I don't know what the hell the song's about."
50:47;50:49;"I like that you kind of traverse..."
50:49;50:52;"Traverse around with, like..."
50:52;50:54;"To me, it's about, like, blinding..."
50:54;50:59;"When, like, you catch, like, the sun glaring off, like, a windshield, it, like, blinds you."
50:59;51:04;"So it's, like, snow, a sheet of paper, like, that's sitting out in the sun."
51:04;51:05;"I mean, I just heard the song. I don't..."
51:05;51:06;"Right, right."
51:06;51:15;"I don't know if I'm going deep on it, but to me, it's, like, a cool little journey through, like, the different permutations of that sensory experience of just, like,
blinding brightness."
51:15;51:17;"And that could be a metaphor for whatever you want it to be, but..."
51:17;51:22;"Well, it seems like it's tied to a relationship and, like, you're blinded by someone's light or you're..."
51:22;51:24;"I don't know. I don't know what the hell it's about."
51:24;51:25;"I don't know how much I should say now."
51:25;51:27;"Yeah, it's just one of those things where I was, like..."
51:27;51:29;"And it's not like I talked to any journalists who were, like, offended by it."
51:29;51:30;"It'll be interesting."
51:30;51:41;"Well, I'm not going to look, but I could imagine, like, just somebody being, like, just because it literally contains the word ""white,"" maybe it will be an invitation
for anybody who wants to write."
51:41;51:42;"Oh, for sure."
51:42;51:43;"But..."
51:43;51:44;"It's a provocative title."
51:44;51:46;"Why is it provocative?"
51:46;51:47;"Um..."
51:47;51:50;"Well, I guess you could just say it raises a hot-button topic."
51:50;51:51;"Exactly."
51:51;51:55;"The song's not provocative in that it's writing a song that's saying something specific."
51:55;51:56;"No, it's not."
51:56;52:00;"I'm just saying, if you see the track listing, that title might stick out."
52:00;52:02;"There'll probably be somebody who gets to work..."
52:02;52:04;"Well, maybe somebody who can write a tweet without hearing it, I'm sure."
52:04;52:05;"Oh, hell yeah."
52:05;52:06;"That's how it works."
52:06;52:11;"But anyway, anybody who wants to spend some time with the song, I'm happy to talk about it eventually."
52:11;52:13;"I just can't even put my finger on it anymore."
52:13;52:14;"When..."
52:14;52:16;"I just don't know anymore, because I do feel like..."
52:16;52:19;"I don't like the idea of just leaving things sitting forever."
52:19;52:25;"But I do feel like it's important to let people engage with an album before you start breaking everything down."
52:25;52:26;"Yeah."
52:26;52:28;"I have a lot of very specific things I could say about this song."
52:28;52:31;"I don't want to do it in response to anybody, though."
52:31;52:33;"Give it time, dude. Let it breathe."
52:33;52:34;"I'll let it breathe."
52:34;52:35;"Being provocative is cool, man."
52:35;52:37;"Provocative just sounds to me like..."
52:37;52:39;"You're just trolling for attention?"
52:39;52:41;"Like Marilyn Manson or something."
52:41;52:43;"I'm just saying, when you see the title..."
52:43;52:44;"I understand that."
52:44;52:45;"Like, Sunflower's not provocative."
52:45;52:47;"Harmony Hall is not provocative."
52:47;52:48;"Yeah."
52:48;52:50;"Unbearably White is provocative."
52:50;52:51;"I like the title."
52:51;52:53;"It's good to have a title or two that sticks out."
52:53;52:55;"Well, and also the truth is..."
52:55;52:57;"Should've called it Unbearably Buff."
52:57;53:00;"[laughter]"
53:00;53:02;"The last thing I'll say before we move on is..."
53:02;53:08;"I'd be insane if I said, like, ""Really? People heard Unbearably White and they want to talk about race or identity?"""
53:08;53:09;"That'd be insane."
53:09;53:12;"I think there's multiple valid interpretations to a song sometimes."
53:12;53:16;"And I think a really good song sometimes has that flexibility."
53:16;53:21;"But, yeah, I just hope that if people want to interpret it through that lens, I think it's totally valid."
53:21;53:22;"I just, uh..."
53:22;53:23;"Yeah, now I'm..."
53:23;53:24;"See, well, no, I don't think it..."
53:24;53:28;"I mean, like, if you actually listen to this song, you don't listen to it and you're like,"
53:28;53:31;"""Well, this was an interesting commentary on race in America in 2019."""
53:31;53:35;"It seems much more personal and poetic and abstract to me."
53:35;53:36;"Well, I guess that's the thing."
53:36;53:38;"It doesn't come up here and there when I've done interviews."
53:38;53:45;"And I finally found the words to say it to somebody, 'cause there's other songs on the album that people really wanted to ask specific questions about."
53:45;53:47;"And they seem to be very personal and specific."
53:47;53:50;"Sometimes people would ask me questions about my own identity and stuff."
53:50;53:53;"And say, like, ""Well, does that factor into how you wrote this song?"""
53:53;53:56;"And my vibe is always like, ""Obviously, I have a..."
53:56;53:58;"My own identity is important to me."
53:58;54:00;"But then I also have my identity as a songwriter."
54:00;54:02;"You know, the land of song."
54:02;54:04;"It's bigger than any one thing."""
54:04;54:10;"So I kind of have this funny feeling where I was trying to put into words this one journalist where I said something along the lines of,"
54:10;54:17;"""It's totally valid if somebody wants to look at a songwriter's lyrics, mine in particular, through the lens of identity."
54:17;54:23;"I just hope if they look at it through the lens of identity, they actually, you know, take the time to look at it through my personal identity."""
54:23;54:28;"If you're gonna treat it just as, like, a set of lyrics, then you might as well just talk in the broad sense about"
54:28;54:30;"what does whiteness refer to in each stanza?"
54:30;54:31;"More like English?"
54:31;54:36;"I guess these are different--actually, as an English major, these are different ways that you can interpret anything."
54:36;54:37;"Right?"
54:37;54:41;"Through the lens of post-modernism, post-colonialism, whatever."
54:41;54:46;"So I kind of feel like if you want to interpret it just, like, on the very basis of language, that's one thing."
54:46;54:47;"Almost in, like, an impersonal way."
54:47;54:51;"But I just kind of feel like if you're gonna go personal, you really gotta go personal."
54:51;54:57;"I can just picture with this song, as soon as somebody hears the title, and they have some half-baked notion of Vampire Weekend,"
54:57;55:00;"I know that there'll be somebody who'll write something that'll say, like,"
55:00;55:04;"""This is Ezra of Vampire Weekend being defensive about whiteness."""
55:04;55:05;"[laughs]"
55:05;55:10;"Or something. Which is, like, the easiest way to, like, villainize the writer of this song."
55:10;55:16;"'Cause we know, like, right now, there's a lot of people who are very defensive about being called out about privilege and whiteness,"
55:16;55:19;"and it's a problem. It's a real problem."
55:19;55:23;"I just kind of feel like--I just don't think there's lyrics in this song to support that."
55:23;55:27;"But if you do want to look at it through the lens of identity, I would just get very specific."
55:27;55:28;"That's all that I would say."
55:28;55:30;"Born in 1984."
55:30;55:33;"You gotta start there. 1984."
55:33;55:35;"You gotta listen to at least 50 hours of TC."
55:35;55:37;"Oh, big time."
55:37;55:40;"Yeah, maybe in two weeks we'll go a little bit deeper."
55:40;55:47;"We skipped the live fandango"
55:47;55:53;"Turned cartwheels across the floor"
55:53;56:00;"I was feeling kind of seasick"
56:00;56:06;"The crowd called out for more"
56:06;56:12;"The room was humming harder"
56:12;56:19;"As the ceiling flew away"
56:19;56:25;"When we call out for another drink"
56:25;56:30;"The waves have brought a train"
56:30;56:38;"And so it was later"
56:38;56:45;"As the military's chair"
56:45;56:50;"Let her face at first just go steep"
56:50;56:57;"Turn the water shade off it"
56:57;57:23;"guitar solo"
57:23;57:30;"She said there is no reason"
57:30;57:36;"And the truth is plain to see"
57:36;57:43;"But I wandered through my playing cards"
57:43;57:49;"Would not let her be"
57:49;57:56;"One of 16 festal virgins"
57:56;58:02;"Leaving for the coast"
58:02;58:08;"I know though my eyes were open"
58:08;58:12;"They might just as well be closed"
58:12;58:21;"And so it was later"
58:21;58:28;"As the military's chair"
58:28;58:33;"Let her face at first just go steep"
58:33;58:38;"Turn the water shade off it"
58:38;58:45;"guitar solo"
58:45;58:48;"A lot of festival lineups are coming out now."
58:48;58:50;"It's festival season."
58:50;58:51;"Festival season's approaching."
58:51;58:55;"So this is a time crisis guide to how to beat the heat."
58:55;58:59;"Jake's gonna go through all the hot fashions for festival season 2019."
58:59;59:02;"We'll walk you through it."
59:02;59:05;"Starting with Coachella."
59:05;59:08;"We're gonna have the TC tent out there."
59:08;59:10;"Selling merch."
59:10;59:12;"Jake's got everything you need."
59:12;59:14;"Stay hydrated, folks."
59:14;59:17;"We're recording live at Jake's libation station"
59:17;59:19;"at Coachella 2019."
59:19;59:22;"That means Jake just like"
59:22;59:25;"I don't even know it's considered Coachella fashion anymore."

59:29;59:31;"Jake in like a neon tank top."
59:31;59:32;"What's up, guys?"
59:32;59:33;"Brutal."
59:33;59:34;"It's festival season."
59:34;59:36;"We're not doing that many festivals this year."
59:36;59:37;"Or maybe we are."
59:37;59:40;"What's the first one on the agenda?"
59:40;59:43;"Not to put anybody on blast, but we politely declined a couple."
59:43;59:45;"Didn't quite feel right this year."
59:45;59:46;"Money was not right."
59:46;59:48;"You know, it wasn't always about the money."
59:48;59:50;"I can't go into detail."
59:50;59:51;"I would love you to go into detail."
59:51;59:53;"I would love to go into detail, too."
59:53;59:54;"What, like the other artists?"
59:54;59:55;"You're like, ""These bands suck."""
59:55;59:56;"Oh, no. Who cares about that?"
59:56;59:57;"No, I'm kidding."
59:57;59:59;"And you know how I love everything."
59:59;01:00:00;"Yeah, you love everything."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"What band would suck?"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Imagine Dragons and the 1975."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You're like, ""Oh, I love it. Let's do it."""
01:00:06;01:00:10;"I would bring them out on stage, grab their hands, and be like,"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"""Guys, come on."""
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yeah."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"""We're all in this together."""
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Artist solidarity."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"There's sometimes shenanigans that go beyond money."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"Sometimes the money's too good, if you know what I mean."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Weird corporate stuff?"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"Sell a piece of your soul."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"Or just like the way the games people play."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"And I'll be honest, like, you know, we're going to roll up to these festivals."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"We're going to put on a damn good show,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"but I've been so focused on the headline show"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"that I want to be like leaving it all out on the field,"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"playing two hours in Islington at 10 a.m."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"That makes me feel like I'm doing something in my life."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"That's strong."
01:00:42;01:00:46;"65-minute set, you know, that's fun, but it's different."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"Oh, dude, I relate to that completely."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"We're playing for TC Heads."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Oh, right."
01:00:51;01:00:56;"Richard Pictures is playing the Skull and Roses Festival April 5th."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I guess that already happened."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"At 3.30 in the afternoon, we're playing an hour."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Whoa."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"That's not how we roll."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"A night for us, the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Spreading two sets."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Yeah, we're playing three hours."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"We're playing two 90-minute sets."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Obviously thrilled to get, you know,"
01:01:14;01:01:18;"to play the 45-minute hour-long set in front of Vampire."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Oh, right, that's kind of a different story."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"That's a whole other can of worms."

01:02:32;01:02:33;"I'd be like, ""Thank God,"""
01:02:33;01:02:36;"because I wasn't always in the mood to play for a long time."

01:03:05;01:03:08;"Went down to the hotel gym, 10 minutes on the tread."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"- Yeah, and you're singing every song."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"- Just about. - That's crazy."
01:03:12;01:03:15;"- You know, last summer, we dropped a few Sister Pearls,"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"and we did a little bit of a Bayo joint."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"- Right, right."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"- And we'll do that again in the future,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"but at least I'm going to be singing the majority of it."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Some of these longer instrumental breaks,"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"I really can relax, though."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"That feels good."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"Didn't always have that in the past,"

01:03:50;01:03:52;"it's like you build some kind of solidarity."

01:03:54;01:03:56;"We're here. We made it this far."""
01:03:56;01:03:58;"But anyway, are you guys kicking off"

01:04:06;01:04:08;"that's about Grateful Dead cover bands"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"and kind of dead adjacent, like Othiel Burbridge"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"is the headliner who plays the dead in co."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"- Does he play in dead in co? - Yeah, he's the bass player."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- Yeah, yeah, I guess he's headlining the fest."
01:04:17;01:04:20;"I don't know if he's playing dead stuff or original material."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"- He's got to do some dead stuff. - I'm sure."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"- Remember, he sang ""Fire in the Mountain"" when we saw him."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- Oh, yeah, that was sick, actually. - Yeah, he's great."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- Not going to see him, unfortunately."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"I think we're just going to be there Friday night."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"We're playing at 3.30 in the afternoon on Friday."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"- You might be the first band of the whole fest."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Well, how do you make yourself stand out?"
01:04:38;01:04:41;"- We've been talking about this with our set list."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"- Has anybody been like, ""Guys, listen."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"""We're one of L.A.'s most beloved Grateful Dead cover bands,"

01:10:01;01:10:03;"testing it out. We tried it later"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"in the set, and that felt pretty good, too, but"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"it's similar to, like, the ""Bird Song"" opener thing,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"where it's like, I almost feel like the opening"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"song is kind of a good-- you don't"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"want to go too slow. Those songs aren't"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"slow. - Mm-mm. - They're not super fast,"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"but-- - But it's not A-punk, yeah. - Yeah."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"There was a rare 3A-punk opener"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"at Lollapalooza last year. - I remember"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"us talking about it. I think-- I think we talked"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"about it. - I remember. I love the concept"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"of the rare opener. We--"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"[laughter] You know, partially because"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"remember that time when we went"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"and we saw the special screening of the"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"1989 ""Grateful Dead"" show at the"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"movie theater? - I do. - Anybody who doesn't"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"remember, on Jerry's birthday every"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"year, they'll do this, like, special thing"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"where you go to a movie theater, buy a ticket,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"like you're going to the movie, and you just sit there and watch"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"a filmed ""Grateful Dead"" concert."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"And we went, and it was just kind of a, like,"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"a funny crowd, some old hippies, some young people."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"- People dancing in the aisles. - People"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"dancing in the aisles. There's probably about 20"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"people in this movie theater in Hollywood. - Yep."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"- I remember reading about-- I was"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"curious to read about the set list before we saw it."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"And that concert that"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"we watched was a very rare"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"""Touch of Gray"" opener. - I don't think that's that"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"rare. - I don't think it's that common."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"- Huh. I bet they did it. - Oh, we need"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Seinfeld. How many ""Touch of Gray""-- 'cause, I mean,"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"definitely, it seems like a first set type of song."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"Is that what you're saying? - I think of that as an opener."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"When you mentioned, um,"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"opening with Harmony Hall, I was like, ""Oh, that's kind of"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"like the dead opening with 'Touch.'"" - Maybe"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"it's not a rare opener. Maybe it's just an"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"opener. - I have to say, um,"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"we opened with ""Touch"" once."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Tough. - 'Cause you wanted to ease in?"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"- You need to be warmed up for that song."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"- Even though it's, like, a song everybody knows?"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"- It's easy for that song to be pretty"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"stiff. - This is a slightly hard"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"thing to look up. You would need to actually get one of those"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"old... - Yeah. - It's easy to look up"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"how many times they played ""Touch."""
01:11:45;01:11:47;"It's funny. It's like those old books"

01:33:59;01:34:01;"Yeah, I feel like it would be weird to drop a Christian song"

01:34:03;01:34:05;"It's, like, a little confused, and it's kind of like--"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"I feel like a lot of, like, songs that are truly called, like, Christian"

01:34:25;01:34:27;"Whatever, praise music or whatever."

01:34:29;01:34:31;"I'm a little less familiar with what you would call Christian pop,"
01:34:31;01:34:35;"but I feel like the vibe I get from a lot of songs that I come across"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"is always, like, ""You lift me up when I'm down."
01:34:38;01:34:41;"""You're the pillar that's holding me up."

01:35:00;01:35:02;"with this kind of music, you could fill me in."
01:35:02;01:35:05;"But I feel like, you know, like anything, like movies or something,"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"there's genre conventions."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"If, like, the hero doesn't live at the end of a horror movie,"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"people would be a little bit like, ""Yeah, that's not how it works."""
01:35:14;01:35:17;"I wonder if there's, like, a Christian artist who came out and, like--"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Probably a lot of Christian songs start a little bit like,"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"""There were times when I was confused, when I was a mess."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"""I didn't know where to turn."""
01:35:24;01:35:25;"Yeah."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"And then the chorus is like, ""But you did this."""

01:35:56;01:35:58;"and be like, ""So I guess you're on Easy Street now."""
01:35:58;01:36:00;"And be like, ""Man, you think I still don't struggle with faith?"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"""Like, that changed my life, but you think there aren't moments"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"""where I, like, cry out in the night?"""
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Like, you know, that's a part of what it means to be--"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"I'm sure, like, a lot of people would say that."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Sure."
01:36:09;01:36:13;"I think there must be Christian music that reflects that."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Early Pedro the Lion."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Oh, yeah, that's-- what are they, like--"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"-Pedro the Lion. -Christian indie?"

01:36:20;01:36:23;"Saw them a lot 20 years ago in Oregon"
01:36:23;01:36:24;"because they were from Washington."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"But, yeah, it was, like-- their first few records, like,"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"was, like, basically a document of the singer David Bazan's,"
01:36:30;01:36:34;"like, struggling with organized Christianity."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"And the first EP is, like-- as I recall,"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"was, like, a little more like, ""I'm a Christian,"
