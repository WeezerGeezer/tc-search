02:03;02:04;"Right."
02:04;02:05;"That'd be more on brand for me."

02:10;02:12;"I went over to like, Hannah was like, you know what?"

02:16;02:18;"Let's just like make it classic."
02:18;02:19;"A name you can trust."
02:19;02:22;"Spent a couple hundred more than I would have elsewhere."
02:22;02:23;"Right."
02:23;02:24;"Anything inscribed on the inside?"
02:24;02:26;"I think Tiffany's."
02:26;02:27;"So I'm wearing the brand."
02:27;02:28;"Wait, it says Tiffany's on the inside?"
02:28;02:29;"Wait, hold on, hold on."
02:29;02:30;"Let me take this off."
02:30;02:31;"I think."
02:31;02:32;"I can't even read it, man."
02:32;02:33;"But it says something on the inside?"
02:33;02:35;"Yeah, Tiffany Co."
02:35;02:40;"So I'm just wearing this brand adjacent to my skin at all times."
02:40;02:45;"So now if we did like one of those magazine like break down the look for you, Jake, it'd"
02:45;02:51;"be like homemade Grateful Dead t-shirt, pair of Lee jeans, New Balances."
02:51;02:52;"Gray polar fleece."
02:52;02:54;"A gray polar fleece."
02:54;02:55;"North face."
02:55;02:59;"A North face polar fleece and a Tiffany's gold ring."
02:59;03:00;"And an old minivan."
03:01;03:02;"Yeah."
03:02;03:03;"I love it."
03:03;03:10;"I love it."
03:31;03:46;"I love it."
03:46;03:55;"I love it."
03:55;04:06;"I love it."
04:06;04:26;"I love it."
05:06;05:22;"I love it."
05:22;05:24;"So we're listening to Bob Dylan, Man and Me."
05:24;05:30;"Right, because this is from your wedding playlist, which is we now have up on Apple Music."
05:30;05:31;"Jake's wedding playlist."
05:31;05:34;"Literally you put up the playlist that you made for your own wedding."
05:34;05:39;"Yeah, my iPhone was plugged into the PA system the entire wedding."
05:39;05:41;"Just, you know, playing for a few hours."
05:41;05:42;"So you didn't hire a DJ."
05:42;05:43;"Nope."
05:43;05:44;"Golden oldies."
05:44;05:45;"Tasteful palette."
05:45;05:50;"This may be Bob's sweetest song."
05:50;05:51;"It's a great song."
05:51;05:53;"This actually is the epitome of tasteful palette."
05:53;05:54;"Oh yeah."
05:54;05:55;"And also it's in Big Lebowski."
05:55;05:57;"Yeah, I mean also that association."
05:57;05:59;"Favorite movies of all time."
05:59;06:00;"You had a small wedding."
06:00;06:03;"Was there dancing or was it more just like a little dancing?"
06:03;06:04;"So yeah, it was a small wedding."
06:04;06:05;"It was 20 people."
06:05;06:09;"It was a few friends and then parents and aunts and uncles."
06:09;06:12;"So it wasn't like a raging dance floor, but we did a first dance."
06:12;06:13;"Yeah, what was the first dance?"
06:13;06:15;"The first song on the playlist, the Elvis song."
06:15;06:16;"The Wonder of You."
06:16;06:19;"Yeah, sort of like late Elvis."
06:19;06:22;"This is like Vegas Elvis?"
06:22;06:23;"Yeah."
06:23;06:27;"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the floor."
06:27;06:29;"Mr. and Mrs. Jake Longstrip."
06:29;06:33;"You got it."
06:33;06:36;"I love this palette too, man."
06:36;06:40;"Hannah's mom loved this choice."
06:40;06:43;"Everyone else was like, ""Come on, man."
06:43;06:44;"That was corny."""
06:44;06:47;"Dave was just like, ""Mm."""
06:47;06:48;"Not tasteful."
06:48;06:49;"He was like, ""Late Elvis."
06:49;06:50;"I don't know."
06:50;06:51;"Okay."""
06:51;06:54;"And you dance for the whole... and then everybody joins you?"
06:54;06:55;"Yeah, yeah."
06:55;06:56;"We dance for the entire song."
06:56;06:57;"But here's the thing."
06:57;07:00;"This has a great James Burton guitar solo in it."
07:00;07:02;"It's two minutes, 15 seconds."
07:02;07:06;"So it's like in and out."
07:06;07:10;"But it's also kind of up-tempo slightly."
07:10;07:15;"So it's not like a painfully slow, plodding dance."
07:15;07:19;"And then after that, we went into some other up-tempo oldies."
07:19;07:22;"And then the old folks got out on the floor and danced for a little bit."
07:22;07:26;"The dancing was like 30 minutes."
07:26;07:27;"Over at 930."
07:27;07:28;"Great."
07:28;07:30;"So mostly just conversation, cracking a cold one."
07:30;07:31;"That was more the vibe?"
07:31;07:32;"Yeah."
07:32;07:33;"It was great."
07:33;07:37;"Great food at the Inverness Yacht Club, which is a beautiful old boathouse that juts out"
07:37;07:38;"into Tomales Bay."
07:38;07:39;"In Northern California."
07:39;07:40;"Yeah."
07:40;07:41;"Great weather."
07:41;07:43;"It was like 70, light breeze, sunny."
07:43;07:44;"Nice."
07:44;07:45;"Beautiful."
07:45;07:46;"We came in in a boat."
07:46;07:49;"Because you got actually married on a dock."
07:49;07:50;"Yep."
07:50;07:51;"Yeah."
07:51;07:53;"And then everyone was gathered at the end of the dock."
07:53;07:59;"And then we made our entrance in this little rowboat with an outboard motor on it."
07:59;08:00;"Yeah."
08:00;08:03;"And dad's friend Tom was wearing a suit and a captain's hat."
08:03;08:04;"And brought us in."
08:04;08:05;"We got out of the dock and then he just sped out."
08:05;08:06;"Amazing."
08:06;08:07;"Oh, what a boat."
08:07;08:08;"I guess I'll never know the reason why."

15:40;16:10;"I guess I'll never know the reason why."
16:10;16:16;"So Jake, we need to think about something vaguely uplifting, at least something proactive"
16:16;16:18;"or things that we can do."
16:18;16:21;"You received a listener email about Puerto Rico."
16:21;16:22;"I did."
16:22;16:23;"Let's read it."
16:23;16:24;"Okay."
16:24;16:25;"Hi, Jake."
16:25;16:30;"I'm Kamiya, pronounced like the Hall & Oates song, Kamiya."
16:30;16:35;"Her name is spelled with one L. The Hall & Oates song is spelled with two Ls, like Kamiya."
16:35;16:42;"Let's listen to the Hall & Oates song so that we know."
16:42;17:08;"Very soundless."
17:08;17:15;"Kamiya."
17:15;17:19;"Okay."
17:19;17:25;"Okay."
17:25;17:29;"So neither Camilla nor Kamiya, Kamiya."
17:29;17:31;"It's almost like chameleon."
17:31;17:32;"Right."
17:32;17:33;"Okay."
17:33;17:34;"Hi, Jake."
17:34;17:36;"I'm Kamiya from Puerto Rico."
17:36;17:39;"I'm also a longtime Time Crisis listener."
17:39;17:44;"I know there's a very slim chance of you reading this, and I feel strange writing to your email"
17:44;17:48;"as I imagine everyone who writes to you about TC feels."
17:48;17:52;"I should let the listeners know they don't need to feel strange about writing to my email"
17:52;17:55;"about this, but Puerto Rico needs help."
17:55;17:59;"About a week ago, Puerto Rico got hit by the worst hurricane in its history, Hurricane"
17:59;18:00;"Maria."
18:00;18:02;"The country is a disaster."
18:02;18:07;"Some towns have been completely flooded, while others have no way of entry or no communication"
18:07;18:10;"has been made with them whatsoever."
18:10;18:12;"We don't know the exact number of casualties yet."
18:12;18:16;"Puerto Rico's return to normalcy is very, very far away."
18:16;18:20;"I finally found some signal to write to you guys."
18:20;18:25;"So I was wondering if there is any possibility of you guys on the show mentioning these ways"
18:25;18:27;"that listeners can help if they wish to."
18:27;18:33;"So we're going to tweet out from the Time Crisis Twitter account links for people to"
18:33;18:34;"donate money."
18:34;18:35;"Some of these organizations."
18:35;18:36;"Yep."
18:36;18:40;"I donated to one already that was like, it said the First Lady of Puerto Rico started"
18:40;18:41;"it."
18:41;18:43;"It's so crazy sometimes knowing where to donate."
18:43;18:48;"Like people, man, if people, I like GoFundMe is when you can just go direct to somebody,"
18:48;18:51;"but so I was just like looking for the best place to donate."
18:51;18:52;"And I see the First Lady of Puerto Rico."
18:52;18:53;"That seems to make sense."
18:53;18:56;"But then there was like all these like on the website, it's like we want to thank all"
18:56;19:00;"our corporate sponsors and it was like McDonald's and all these like harsh places like that."
19:00;19:04;"Look, if McDonald's is giving money to help the people of Puerto Rico, no problem."
19:04;19:05;"Yep."
19:05;19:09;"Just like kind of weird seeing like all these like corporate logos on the thing."
19:09;19:13;"Did you Google that organization to like see if there was any weird chatter about it?"
19:13;19:14;"I didn't see any weird chatter."
19:14;19:19;"I mean, it was on all like respect, quote unquote, respectable newspapers were like"
19:19;19:20;"hyping that one up."
19:20;19:24;"But anyway, we're actually getting somebody from Puerto Rico giving us some ideas."
19:24;19:27;"So we'll tweet that out to everybody, encourage everybody to donate."
19:27;19:28;"Yeah."
19:28;19:31;"So she gave us three or four links to send out."
19:31;19:32;"Oh, thanks, Camelia."
19:32;19:38;"I know the US has has way too much going on, but Puerto Ricans are suffering."
19:38;19:39;"We are American citizens, too."
19:39;19:42;"Just a small mention of our situation would mean the world."
19:42;19:43;"Thank you so much."
19:43;19:44;"P.S."
19:44;19:46;"I've listened to every single episode of the show."
19:46;19:50;"It helped me pass pre calculus."
19:50;19:53;"I would always listen to the show while I studied."
19:53;19:56;"It's also exposed me to a bunch of music I'd never heard before."
19:56;19:57;"You guys are sick."
19:57;19:59;"I hate to be writing under these circumstances."
19:59;20:03;"I wanted to write about how that Coldplay song that was always on the top five is kind"
20:03;20:07;"of my success story or success song."
20:07;20:08;"Long story."
20:08;20:11;"Oh, you know, thanks, Camelia."
20:11;20:14;"Maybe when things settle down, we'll get part to your email."
20:14;20:17;"Yeah, I assume she's talking about I want something just like this."
20:17;20:19;"Chainsmokers featuring Coldplay."
20:19;20:20;"Great song."
20:21;20:22;"Best Chainsmokers song."
20:22;20:23;"I'm not sure about that."
20:23;20:24;"I think Ghibli best Coldplay song."
20:24;20:25;"Really?"
20:25;20:28;"You can make the argument that in yellow."
20:28;20:31;"Yeah, something early."
20:31;20:32;"Yellow's the best early Coldplay song."
20:32;20:33;"Yeah."
20:33;20:36;"Something just like this, the best late one."
20:36;20:37;"I heard that at the gym the other day."
20:37;20:39;"It's a good feel good song."
20:39;20:41;"I mean, I was at the gym this morning."
20:41;20:42;"Yeah."
20:42;20:44;"They blasted November rain."
20:44;20:46;"Oh, in its entirety."
20:46;20:47;"The whole thing."
20:47;20:49;"It was so good."
20:49;20:50;"That's a long song."
20:50;20:55;"That's a beautiful song and weirdly good for working out because it picks up at the end."
20:55;20:58;"Yeah, I mean, it's just like, I mean, I'm into ballads."
20:58;21:01;"I mean, I can rock out to a ballad."
21:01;21:02;"Yeah."
21:02;21:05;"I was sort of like, I wish Axl had written more stuff like this."
21:05;21:07;"Maybe just had one in him."
21:07;21:10;"You know, those G and R fans, man, they want the hard stuff."
21:10;21:12;"They'll accept a ballad every now and then."
21:12;21:16;"But I mean, that song is like beautiful."
21:16;21:17;"Yeah."
21:17;21:19;"Maybe the best G and R song."
21:19;21:20;"It's a great song."
21:20;21:21;"If you want to love me, then darling don't refrain."
21:21;21:22;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:22;21:23;"You need some time on your own."
21:23;21:23;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:23;21:24;"You need some time on your own."
21:24;21:25;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:25;21:26;"You need some time on your own."
21:26;21:26;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:26;21:27;"You need some time on your own."
21:27;21:28;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:28;21:28;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:28;21:29;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
21:44;22:03;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
22:03;22:32;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
22:32;22:33;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
22:48;23:09;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
23:09;23:38;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
23:38;24:06;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
24:06;24:08;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
24:08;24:09;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
24:23;24:51;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
24:51;24:58;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
24:58;25:02;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
25:10;25:13;"I just end up walking in the cold November rain."
29:30;29:33;"Andrew WK is getting everybody clapping their hands."
29:39;29:41;"This is sick."
29:41;29:43;"It's better than I remembered."
29:43;29:46;"I remember I really making a egregious guitar f*** up."
29:49;29:51;"I'm so bad at learning lyrics too."
29:51;29:52;"I know I definitely--"
29:52;29:54;"Classic cover style."
29:54;29:56;"I can relate playing in a cover band."
29:56;30:00;"It's like Dave Giger, like, ""I've got to memorize these lyrics."""
30:13;30:15;"Maybe we've got to get this back--"
30:15;30:18;"We've got to get this back in the Vampire Weekend live canon."
30:18;30:21;"And then you do 8-minute version and jam it out."
30:21;30:24;"You bring the Jerry vibes with the petty vibes."
30:31;30:33;"This is sick, dude."
30:52;30:53;"Oh, that's right."
30:53;30:57;"[laughter]"
30:57;31:01;"Well, it wouldn't be an indie rock show without a little half step off."
31:01;31:03;"[laughter]"
31:03;31:04;"That's great, man."
31:04;31:05;"I was just sitting there on YouTube."
31:05;31:07;"Vampire Weekend, don't come around here no more."
31:07;31:08;"I love it."
31:08;31:10;"Yeah, so we covered that, that one time at Central Park."
31:10;31:11;"Just once."
31:11;31:12;"Yeah, just once."
31:12;31:13;"You know what it is?"
31:13;31:14;"Maybe it was self-conscious."
31:14;31:15;"I always loved Tom Petty."
31:15;31:17;"I always thought he was a f***ing poet."
31:17;31:21;"But maybe early Vampire Weekend days, I had this weird feeling like,"
31:21;31:23;"""Oh, people think that we're like frat rock,"
31:23;31:26;"and people think that Tom Petty is frat rock."""
31:26;31:27;"I don't know."
31:27;31:30;"God, I never would think of either of you guys as frat rock."
31:30;31:34;"I think of like, you know, whatever, AC/DC or something, you know."
31:34;31:35;"Yeah, who knows?"
31:35;31:36;"Maybe this is like weird, young--"
31:36;31:38;"It's interesting you say that."
31:38;31:39;"Yeah, young and uptight."
31:39;31:40;"Sure."
31:40;31:41;"But--"
31:41;31:43;"Oh, and then one time at some event,"
31:43;31:47;"we covered the '90s Tom Petty song called ""Walls."""
31:47;31:49;"It's on the ""She's the One"" soundtrack."
31:49;31:50;"It was a single."
31:50;31:56;"It goes, ""Cause you got a heart so big, it could crush this town."""
31:56;31:57;"You know that one?"
31:57;31:58;"I don't think I do."
31:58;31:59;"It's a good song."
31:59;32:02;"Anyway, we had certain songs that we just play every show,"
32:02;32:06;"but I can't think of any artist who we ever covered three different times."
32:06;32:07;"Wow."
32:07;32:08;"So yeah, I've always loved Tom Petty,"
32:08;32:11;"and I think also as I've gotten older,"
32:11;32:14;"he definitely has become more of an influence in a way"
32:14;32:20;"because he doesn't wear like big metaphors or language on his sleeve."
32:20;32:23;"You can easily make the mistake of saying that he's not at the level"
32:23;32:26;"of the Springsteens or the Dylans or whatever, but he really is."
32:26;32:30;"And that's why ""Free Fallin'"" is probably the song I've come back to the most"
32:30;32:32;"in my life, just like thinking about the lyrics."
32:32;32:34;"What do I really think this song means?"
32:34;32:37;"And he's one of those dudes who it's like it's actually very simple"
32:37;32:40;"and very profound, just as profound as those other guys."
32:40;32:41;"No, you're right."
32:41;32:46;"I mean, I think when I was younger, I gravitated towards the sort of like"
32:46;32:50;"stuff that was like on the surface level more edgy,"
32:50;32:55;"whether it was like the Beatles, which were sort of the vanguard of their day,"
32:55;32:58;"or whether it was like '90s alternative indie stuff."
32:58;32:59;"A little more experimental."
32:59;33:00;"Yeah, exactly."
33:00;33:02;"Tom Petty's like quietly experimental."
33:02;33:04;"He's a very modest artist."
33:04;33:06;"Yeah, he's a mellow dude."
33:06;33:07;"Smoked a lot of weed."
33:07;33:09;"Just laid back."
33:09;33:11;"Just a f***ing cool guy, you know?"
33:11;33:14;"Here's the next question from the email."
33:14;33:19;"Would either of you consider yourself Pettyheads or casual fans/listeners?"
33:19;33:24;"I'll be honest, with Tom Petty, I feel so connected to certain songs,"
33:24;33:29;"but, you know, I'm casual, and yet with certain songs, I feel like very connected."
33:29;33:32;"Nothing wrong with having an amazing greatest hits."
33:32;33:38;"I mean, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Steve Miller Band."
33:38;33:39;"You know."
33:39;33:41;"Billy Joel, Volume 1 and 2."
33:41;33:42;"Yeah."
33:42;33:46;"I mean, there's some artists where it's true, like the deeper cuts maybe don't hit as hard."
33:46;33:47;"All good."
33:47;33:48;"He asked, ""Favorite deep cut?"
33:48;33:50;"Mine is 'Mystic Eyes' from the live anthology album,"
33:50;33:55;"which is a dead-esque nine-minute cover of an originally sub-three-minute Van Morrison song"
33:55;33:58;"that kind of makes eight-minute Cape Cod seem unambitious."""
33:58;34:00;"Wow, shots fired."
34:00;34:02;"I like that he's challenging you."
34:02;34:03;"Wait till you hear it, Zach."
34:03;34:06;"Wait till we get that eight-minute Cape Cod out there."
34:06;34:08;"Do you have a favorite Tom Petty deep cut?"
34:08;34:09;"I mean, a couple."
34:09;34:11;"I mean, is even ""The Loser"" a deep cut?"
34:11;34:12;"I thought that was a single."
34:12;34:16;"There's one from one of the later records called ""Square One,"""
34:16;34:21;"which is like a beautiful ballad from like maybe '06, '07, somewhere in there."
34:21;34:22;"Oh, that's cool."
34:22;34:23;"2000s era Tom Petty."
34:23;34:24;"Yeah, yeah, it's really beautiful."
34:24;34:27;"Had to find some higher ground"
34:27;34:31;"Had some fear to get around"
34:31;34:35;"You can say what you don't know"
34:35;34:40;"Later on won't work no more"
34:40;34:46;"Last time through I hit my tracks"
34:46;34:51;"So well I could not get back"
34:53;34:55;"Yeah, my way was hard to find"
34:55;35:00;"Can't sell yourself for peace of mind"
35:00;35:06;"Square One, my slate is clear"
35:06;35:11;"Rest your head on me, my dear"
35:11;35:13;"It took a world of trouble"
35:13;35:15;"It took a world of tears"
35:15;35:17;"It took a long time"
35:17;35:21;"To get back here"
35:22;35:25;"[Guitar]"
35:25;35:28;"Try so hard to stand alone"
35:28;35:33;"Struggle to see past my nose"
35:33;35:37;"Always had more dogs than bones"
35:37;35:42;"I could never wear those clothes"
35:42;35:48;"It's a dark victory"
35:49;35:52;"You won and you also lost"
35:52;35:57;"Told us you were satisfied"
35:57;36:01;"But it never came across"
36:01;36:07;"Square One, my slate is clear"
36:07;36:12;"Rest your head on me, my dear"
36:12;36:14;"It took a world of trouble"
36:14;36:16;"It took a world of tears"
36:16;36:19;"It took a long time"
36:19;36:22;"To get back here"
36:22;36:29;"[Guitar]"
36:29;36:32;"[Guitar]"
36:32;36:49;"Square One, my slate is clear"
36:49;36:54;"Rest your head on me, my dear"
36:54;36:56;"It took a world of trouble"
36:56;36:58;"It took a world of tears"
36:58;37:01;"It took a long time"
37:01;37:04;"To get back here"
37:04;37:11;"Square One, my slate is clear"
37:11;37:16;"Rest your head on me, my dear"
37:16;37:18;"It took a world of trouble"
37:18;37:20;"It took a world of tears"
37:20;37:23;"It took a long time"
37:23;37:25;"To get back here"
37:25;37:27;"So like I was saying, you know,"
37:27;37:31;"it's kind of basic, but my favorite Tom Petty song is ""Free Fallin'."""
37:31;37:34;"It's one that I've come back to over and over again in my life,"
37:34;37:36;"and I feel like I've really studied it."
37:36;37:38;"Great video, I've studied the video too."
37:38;37:41;"Actually, in the Vampire Weekend holiday video,"
37:41;37:43;"there's an homage to the ""Free Fallin'"" video."
37:43;37:44;"Really?"
37:44;37:48;"In ""Free Fallin',"" Tom's like up on a roof in the first verse,"
37:48;37:52;"and there's like this girl's birthday party by the pool beneath him,"
37:52;37:54;"and he's like up there, and we did a shot like that in holiday,"
37:54;37:58;"where there's like a pool party, and I'm like up on the roof in a powdered wig."
37:58;38:01;"It's a little connected."
38:01;38:02;"Holiday"
38:02;38:05;"So one thing that I always thought was interesting about ""Free Fallin'"""
38:05;38:09;"is just like, you know, when I was a kid, in my neighborhood,"
38:09;38:14;"I would hear this song, this just goofy, simple song that the kids would sing,"
38:14;38:17;"and a lot of kids I remember would always say,"
38:17;38:19;"""'Cause I'm free, free ballin',"""
38:19;38:23;"which for people who don't know, I don't know if people still use that phrase,"
38:23;38:25;"that just means you're not wearing underwear."
38:25;38:26;"Are you familiar with this phrase, Jake?"
38:26;38:32;"I was typing an email today, and I was referencing the song ""Free Fallin'"" in it,"
38:32;38:34;"and the autocorrect went to ""Free Ballin'."""
38:34;38:38;"Classic autocorrect."
38:38;38:40;"And I was like, ""Are you serious?"""
38:40;38:43;"I just, yeah, I remember a lot of kids just being like,"
38:43;38:45;"""'Cause I'm free, free ballin'"""
38:45;38:46;"That's pretty funny."
38:46;38:48;"So everybody's been at a bar somewhere,"
38:48;38:50;"where there's just like a bunch of kind of like fratty white dudes,"
38:50;38:52;"just like, ""Free Fallin',"""
38:52;38:54;"and you're just kind of like,"
38:54;38:56;"but I think it's a very misunderstood song."
38:56;38:59;"I think it's almost like born in the USA style,"
38:59;39:01;"because maybe this is obvious,"
39:01;39:04;"and people will be like, ""Everybody feels this way about the song,"""
39:04;39:10;"but I think the way that sometimes the song comes across in a bar or a grill setting,"
39:10;39:11;"Like a casual setting."
39:11;39:14;"It's almost like the chorus is like triumphant in a way,"
39:14;39:16;"and then you really stop and think about like,"
39:16;39:17;"""What does 'Free Fallin'' mean?"""
39:17;39:18;"Let's break it down."
39:18;39:19;"Let's start it."
39:19;39:21;"This is one of my favorite songs of all time."
39:22;39:24;"Produced by Jeff Lynne."
39:24;39:25;"Love that."
39:25;39:26;"Electric Light Orchestra."
39:26;39:29;"Wilburys."
39:29;39:30;"1989."
39:30;39:34;"She's a good girl"
39:34;39:37;"Loves her mama"
39:37;39:40;"Loves Jesus"
39:40;39:43;"In America too"
39:43;39:46;"She's a good girl"
39:46;39:49;"Is crazy 'bout Elvis"
39:49;39:52;"Loves horses"
39:52;39:53;"And her boyfriend"
39:53;39:54;"He's coming out of the gate really hot."
39:54;39:55;"Yeah."
39:55;39:59;"Jesus, America, Elvis, horses."
39:59;40:01;"You know what I love too?"
40:01;40:04;"In this song, he says ""Free Fallin'"" like 20 times."
40:04;40:07;"He says ""She's a good girl"" twice in the entire song."
40:07;40:09;"And it's so like burned in."
40:09;40:10;"You're like, ""That's 'Free Fallin''."""
40:10;40:12;"She's a good girl"
40:12;40:13;"That's all it takes."
40:13;40:14;"Good lyrics."
40:14;40:16;"You don't have to say it over and over again."
40:16;40:19;"So, yeah, right off the bat, he's coming out big."
40:19;40:20;"She's a good girl."
40:20;40:21;"Loves her mama."
40:21;40:22;"Loves Jesus in America too."
40:22;40:24;"So she's a little on the conservative side."
40:24;40:25;"Yeah."
40:25;40:27;"Is this set in the '50s or the early '60s?"
40:27;40:28;"Great question, Jay."
40:28;40:30;"That's how I interpret it."
40:30;40:31;"That's a great question because in the video,"
40:31;40:34;"the first verse looks like it's set in the '50s."
40:34;40:38;"And then the second verse is like suddenly it's 1989, L.A. in the valley."
40:38;40:39;"Right, 'cause I remember the video."
40:39;40:41;"There were kids skating in an empty pool."
40:41;40:43;"Yeah, so that's '50s."
40:43;40:45;"They're cutting it up on a half pipe."
40:45;40:46;"Half pipe."
40:46;40:47;"Oh, on a half pipe."
40:47;40:48;"Up in the Hollywood Hills."
40:48;40:51;"So this is kind of, I guess, for, you know, in the '50s,"
40:51;40:55;"that's the equivalent of what people would say now is a basic person."
40:55;40:57;"She's crazy about Bieber."
40:57;40:58;"She's a good girl."
40:58;40:59;"Loves her mama."
40:59;41:00;"That stays."
41:00;41:04;"Loves Jesus in America too."
41:04;41:06;"And Instagram too."
41:06;41:07;"She's a good girl."
41:07;41:09;"Crazy about Bieber."
41:09;41:11;"This is something about Uggs and pumpkin spice lattes."
41:11;41:12;"That's the stereotype."
41:12;41:13;"Right."
41:13;41:17;"She's somewhat skeptical about America's imperialism."
41:17;41:20;"Loves Jesus and Hillary too."
41:20;41:24;"She's real bummed out that Trump won the election."
41:24;41:26;"Just a solid moderate liberal."
41:26;41:27;"Yeah."
41:27;41:32;"Didn't like Bernie."
41:32;41:34;"A little too caustic."
41:34;41:36;"Yeah."
41:36;41:39;"Also, I love that this girl loves horses and her boy--"
41:39;41:43;"Okay, the one part of this song that confuses me is she loves horses and her boyfriend too."
41:43;41:46;"Because maybe it's--I don't know."
41:46;41:48;"Horses are a deeper love."
41:48;41:49;"She's young."
41:49;41:52;"She, in a deeper sense, understands that this high school boyfriend is like--"
41:52;41:54;"She's not going to marry him."
41:54;41:55;"Well, then the question also--"
41:55;41:57;"It's sort of like she loves him, but it's like, eh."
41:57;41:59;"Well, the question is also who is Tom Petty in this song?"
41:59;42:01;"Because we've got to listen to the--he's not the boyfriend."
42:01;42:02;"We've got to listen to this part."
42:02;42:04;"Drums drop."
42:20;42:21;"This is where it turns."
42:26;42:27;"This is just good-ass song."
42:27;42:28;"No, it's--"
42:28;42:31;"He's talking about the girl, just describing her."
42:31;42:34;"And you're like, okay, is this song about just good girls?"
42:34;42:35;"Yeah."
42:35;42:37;"And then suddenly it gets a little more specific."
42:37;42:38;"He's talking about her--"
42:38;42:39;"So specific."
42:39;42:42;"Yeah, so he's talking about this very generalized American good girl."
42:42;42:43;"Yeah."
42:43;42:45;"Jesus America Elvis Horse's boyfriend."
42:45;42:47;"The four horsemen--"
42:47;42:48;"Mama."
42:48;42:49;"Oh, and Mama."
42:49;42:54;"The five horsemen of American femininity, according to Tom Petty."
42:54;42:55;"Circa 1961."
42:55;42:57;"Then it gets really specific."
42:57;42:58;"It's a long day living in Reseda."
42:58;43:00;"So, okay, now we know where we are."
43:00;43:02;"We're in the San Fernando Valley."
43:02;43:03;"Yep."
43:03;43:06;"You know, sometimes you take it for granted that everybody knows what that really means,"
43:06;43:08;"but maybe as people who spend a lot of time in L.A., we should explain."
43:08;43:10;"As a kid, I didn't know."
43:10;43:11;"I'm growing up on the East Coast."
43:11;43:13;"I don't know what Reseda is."
43:13;43:14;"Yeah, me neither."
43:14;43:16;"I mean, the best way that I've--"
43:16;43:18;"This is like yet another comparison."
43:18;43:21;"It might not help people, but I was always kind of understood."
43:21;43:24;"The Valley is a little bit like New Jersey, where I'm from."
43:24;43:27;"In New Jersey, you're across the river from the action."
43:27;43:28;"Right."
43:28;43:32;"I don't think New Jersey produces such pathos like the Sopranos and Bruce Springsteen"
43:32;43:35;"because we're just across the river from the action."
43:35;43:39;"And in the Valley, you're just over the mountains from the action."
43:39;43:40;"Yep."
43:40;43:43;"So much stuff in American pop culture is set in L.A."
43:43;43:46;"that probably people who aren't from L.A."
43:46;43:47;"We heard all this stuff growing up."
43:47;43:48;"So a Valley girl."
43:48;43:49;"Right."
43:49;43:52;"When I was a kid, people always talk about a Valley girl, and I was like,"
43:52;43:54;"""Oh, is a Valley girl just like a cool L.A. girl?"""
43:54;43:55;"But there's this other undertone."
43:55;43:57;"It's a little bit like a Jersey girl."
43:57;43:58;"She's cool."
43:58;43:59;"Suburban."
43:59;44:00;"But she's not from Beverly Hills."
44:00;44:01;"Yep."
44:01;44:02;"Like when they made that--Sit Rank Zappa had that song."
44:02;44:04;"It was a little bit like making fun of her."
44:04;44:05;"Absolutely."
44:05;44:07;"And then if people might remember from the '90s in Clueless,"
44:07;44:09;"there's a lot of jokes about the Valley too"
44:09;44:12;"because Alicia Silverstone's character is from Beverly Hills."
44:12;44:16;"So she's from like fancy, right in the mix, L.A."
44:16;44:19;"Her dad's a power broker, lawyer."
44:19;44:22;"And then there's like a joke about they go to a party in the Valley,"
44:22;44:24;"and it's like this whole thing, and then she gets lost,"
44:24;44:27;"and she has to call her brother and be like, ""I'm lost in the Valley,"""
44:27;44:30;"and he has to pick her up at Circus Liquors."
44:30;44:34;"So the whole concept of the Valley is that it's like a lower middle class--"
44:34;44:40;"I encountered Reseda again in Paul Thomas Anderson's film Boogie Nights,"
44:40;44:43;"and there's references to Reseda in that film,"
44:43;44:46;"and maybe even the Burt Reynolds character who's the porn director."
44:46;44:48;"I think his house might be in Reseda."
44:48;44:49;"In Reseda."
44:49;44:50;"It's not Hollywood."
44:50;44:51;"Yeah."
44:51;44:52;"It's not fancy."
44:52;44:55;"It's like a big suburban nowheresville kind of thing."
44:55;45:00;"And just in case you weren't familiar with Southern Californian geography,"
45:00;45:02;"he follows up It's a Long Day Living in Reseda"
45:02;45:05;"with there's a freeway running through the yard."
45:05;45:08;"And that's true is that in the Valley,"
45:08;45:11;"they weren't going to put up the 101 through Brentwood."
45:11;45:14;"They put the 101 going through these kind of lower middle class towns."
45:14;45:17;"So it's like, you know, it's got that Jersey vibe,"
45:17;45:19;"that kind of like--the way people talk about it,"
45:19;45:21;"almost like the [expletive] suburb."
45:21;45:23;"So she's got a freeway running through the yard."
45:23;45:25;"And then this is when it gets really emotional."
45:25;45:28;"First verse is about a good girl, and I'm a bad boy"
45:28;45:30;"because I don't even miss her."
45:30;45:32;"I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart."
45:32;45:35;"So now we finally know who Tom Petty is in this song."
45:35;45:36;"He broke up with her."
45:36;45:37;"He's standing in the shadows."
45:37;45:40;"Yeah, I'm still a little bit confused about who her boyfriend is."
45:40;45:41;"She loves him."
45:41;45:42;"Let's get--"
45:42;45:43;"Maybe he is the boyfriend."
45:43;45:44;"Wait, wait."
45:44;45:45;"Yeah, that's what I thought."
45:45;45:46;"What do you mean?"
45:46;45:48;"Well, because it depends when does freefalling take place."
45:48;45:49;"I thought he already broke up with her."
45:49;45:50;"Yeah, he's saying, ""I'm a bad boy."""
45:50;45:53;"No, but in the first verse he says she loves horses and her boyfriend too."
45:53;45:54;"Oh, okay."
45:54;45:56;"I see what you're saying."
45:56;45:59;"Like if you broke up with somebody and you felt bad about it,"
45:59;46:00;"be like, ""You know what, man?"""
46:00;46:01;"And you're like, ""Come on, man."
46:01;46:02;"It wasn't working."""
46:02;46:04;"You're like, ""Yeah, but she's such a good person."""
46:04;46:07;"She loves Jesus and America too."
46:07;46:08;"""Yeah?"
46:08;46:10;"Yeah, she's just--she's so great."
46:10;46:12;"I feel so bad that I hurt her."""
46:12;46:15;"She loves horses and her boyfriend too."
46:15;46:17;"And then your friend would be like, ""Wait, she has a boyfriend?"
46:17;46:18;"A new boyfriend?"""
46:18;46:19;"No, I'm the boyfriend."
46:19;46:20;"""Web, I thought you broke up with her."""
46:20;46:21;"You're speaking in third person?"
46:21;46:22;"""I thought you broke up with her."
46:22;46:24;"You're the ex-boyfriend."""
46:24;46:27;"""Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, that doesn't make any sense."""
46:27;46:28;"Hmm."
46:28;46:29;"Okay, I see what you're saying."
46:29;46:31;"And I'm going to say that like the song is so--"
46:31;46:33;"Or he's--it's a scene shift."
46:33;46:34;"Maybe."
46:34;46:40;"The song is so economical and sparsely written that I have to give him the benefit of the doubt"
46:40;46:42;"that that was--that it's all intentional."
46:42;46:45;"And then maybe he's not the boyfriend."
46:45;46:49;"Because, you know, if you're kind of like a lazy songwriter, you might be like,"
46:49;46:54;"""It doesn't sing well for me to say, 'And she loves me too.'"""
46:54;46:55;"It's one of two things."
46:55;47:01;"Either the first verse takes place in a different time period,"
47:01;47:04;"and then the second verse we're shifting to after he broke up with her,"
47:04;47:08;"or this is like--this like high school sweetheart type thing,"
47:08;47:11;"this girl that he loves so much, they had such a special connection,"
47:11;47:13;"he broke up with her because he's a bad boy."
47:13;47:15;"He messed it up. He hurt her."
47:15;47:20;"And now a year later, he's talking about her, and she's got a new boyfriend,"
47:20;47:27;"but he's kind of a herb, and Tom Petty is like kind of thinking about how, like, damn."
47:27;47:30;"So where's he falling to? He's free falling."
47:30;47:32;"Well, so then we finally get to the chorus."
47:32;47:43;"♪ And I'm free, free falling ♪"
47:43;47:51;"♪ Yeah, I'm free, free falling ♪"
47:51;47:52;"Classic chorus."
47:52;47:56;"Okay, so this is where my point is that I feel like it's somewhat misunderstood,"
47:56;47:59;"and I'm sure a lot of people are listening and be like, ""No, it's not misunderstood."""
47:59;48:00;"That's exactly how I've heard it,"
48:00;48:03;"but I just always had this feeling that people sing along to that chorus"
48:03;48:04;"in such a triumphant way."
48:04;48:05;"Like, ""I'm free."""
48:05;48:10;"But that's the whole point to me of the chorus is that it's, ""And I'm free."""
48:10;48:13;"Normally when you say, ""I'm free,"" it's a liberating feeling."
48:13;48:17;"This is America. We pride ourselves on freedom, individual liberty."
48:17;48:18;"Yeah."
48:18;48:23;"But to me, the whole point of this song is that this is about the dark side of freedom."
48:23;48:24;"It's not a celebration of freedom."
48:24;48:28;"He says, ""And I'm free."" It doesn't feel good to be free falling."
48:28;48:29;"Right."
48:29;48:32;"The whole title of the song, ""Free Falling,"" that's like f*cked up."
48:32;48:35;"That's like your life's in a tailspin."
48:35;48:36;"You're unmoored."
48:36;48:37;"And I think that's some real sh*t."
48:37;48:40;"I think that the American obsession with freedom--"
48:40;48:43;"we like to think that freedom is just something you fight for,"
48:43;48:44;"and then once you have freedom--"
48:44;48:48;"you know, like when we talk about war, freedom isn't free."
48:48;48:52;"As if that's the equation, that it's like, ""Freedom is, of course, a good thing."""
48:52;48:54;"Gotta go 7oz murder people to get it."
48:54;48:56;"But once you have it, it's a good thing."
48:56;48:58;"Whereas Tom Petty, it's an interesting point."
48:58;49:02;"He's saying he broke up with this girl, and he's free."
49:02;49:04;"So in that sense, he no longer has a girlfriend."
49:04;49:07;"He no longer has to pretend that he's crazy about Elvis and Jesus, too."
49:07;49:09;"He can do whatever he wants."
49:09;49:12;"So it's half a good feeling, it's half a terrible feeling."
49:12;49:13;"He's free falling."
49:13;49:15;"He's talking about life being in free fall."
49:15;49:16;"It's harsh."
49:16;49:18;"He's just walking around the mall aimlessly."
49:18;49:19;"Yeah, in the video."
49:19;49:21;"He's just at the mall by himself."
49:21;49:26;"He's just like, ""Guess I'll check out Hot Topic and Tape World."""
49:26;49:27;"Yeah."
49:27;49:28;"Solo."
49:28;49:30;"Should also point out that this was on his first solo album."
49:30;49:31;"Oh, wow."
49:31;49:35;"People always forget that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Tom Petty are two separate things."
49:35;49:36;"Sure, sure, sure."
49:36;49:40;"So in another sense, he's by himself now, 39-year-old man."
49:40;49:42;"Was he 39?"
49:42;49:43;"Yeah."
49:43;49:44;"This came out in 1989."
49:44;49:45;"Oh, yeah."
49:45;49:48;"So it's actually a really sad song."
49:48;49:50;"He made a decision that maybe he felt like he had to do."
49:50;49:52;"He had to break up with this person."
49:52;49:57;"But you always carry that harshness with you."
49:57;50:02;"That's the weird thing about growing older is that every decision you make is a trade-off."
50:02;50:03;"Fork in the road."
50:03;50:05;"Yeah."
50:05;50:11;"There's no version of life where you make all the right decisions and you come out on the other end like perfect."
50:11;50:12;"Oh, yeah."
50:12;50:13;"You make the right decisions."
50:13;50:21;"And people on their deathbed full of regrets no matter how well they choose because every decision"
50:21;50:27;"whether romantic or whatever, you make a choice for freedom, you got to pay the piper."
50:27;50:28;"Regret."
50:29;50:37;"To quote another PTA film, Magnolia, Robards on his deathbed, ""Regret!"""
50:37;50:39;"Everybody has regret on their deathbed."
50:39;50:40;"That's just life."
50:40;50:41;"Sound free, free font."
50:41;50:43;"All right, let's get into the second verse."
50:43;50:54;"All the vampires walking through the valley move west down Ventura Boulevard."
50:54;51:00;"And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows."
51:00;51:04;"And the good girls are home with broken hearts."
51:04;51:14;"Yeah, it's crazy how he goes from hyper-specific regional details to like super universal human truths."
51:14;51:18;"He's just like jumping back and forth over that chasm."
51:18;51:19;"It's deep."
51:19;51:20;"It's something he's really good at."
51:20;51:21;"Yeah."
51:21;51:27;"So all the vampires walking through the valley, again, the San Fernando Valley, he's being very clear that the song takes place in the valley."
51:27;51:28;"Yep."
51:28;51:30;"Move west down Ventura Boulevard."
51:30;51:33;"That's kind of the main commercial drag in the valley."
51:33;51:34;"Who are the vampires?"
51:34;51:36;"Are they the same as the bad boys?"
51:36;51:38;"And all the vampires."
51:38;51:43;"Or maybe he's just trying to paint a picture of like the opening of the song is so wholesome."
51:43;51:46;"Mama, Jesus, America, Elvis, horse, his boyfriend."
51:46;51:47;"Right."
51:47;51:53;"And then maybe this is about like how that innocence gets shattered through heartbreak or whatever."
51:53;51:57;"Do the vampires just represent something kind of darker, more evil in the world?"
51:57;51:58;"Yeah."
51:58;52:02;"Like you're a good girl having a pool party in Reseda."
52:02;52:06;"But just a few blocks away on Ventura Boulevard are vampires."
52:06;52:07;"There's a vampire."
52:07;52:09;"Emotional vampires."
52:09;52:12;"I'm picturing just like a really pale, like pasty, like goth dude."
52:12;52:13;"Yeah."
52:13;52:19;"Just like walking down Ventura Boulevard at like 90 degree heat wearing like a trench coat."
52:19;52:21;"Just going into like a subway."
52:21;52:24;"Let me get the six inch."
52:24;52:26;"This good girl, she's like going to subway."
52:26;52:31;"She just got her driver's license, drives a subway by herself for the first time, sees this dude and just like, what?"
52:31;52:33;"This is like gross."
52:33;52:35;"Like he's no Elvis."
52:35;52:38;"Just pasty like punk dude."
52:38;52:39;"Yeah."
52:39;52:42;"In the video they have some actual like, she starts hanging out with like goth dudes."
52:42;52:44;"I haven't seen the video in like, you know, 20 years."
52:44;52:45;"Great video."
52:45;52:50;"So then he says all the bad boys are standing in the shadows and the good girls are home with broken hearts."
52:50;52:52;"He's kind of like generalizing too."
52:52;52:54;"Just like, look at this world."
52:54;52:56;"You got vampires walking around."
52:56;53:00;"Why can't the boys and the girls just be together and have a good time?"
53:00;53:01;"Because life's not like that."
53:01;53:02;"People break up."
53:02;53:03;"Things fall apart."
53:03;53:06;"It reminds me of like you hear those stories of like, yeah, they got divorced."
53:06;53:14;"They had a 32 year marriage and he just decided to he wanted to live by himself in an apartment by the golf course."
53:14;53:15;"Yeah."
53:15;53:16;"Free falling."
53:16;53:17;"Right."
53:17;53:18;"You know, it's just like, what?"
53:18;53:19;"All right, dude, I get it."
53:19;53:22;"You always felt like your wife didn't support your golfing."
53:22;53:25;"Now you can golf as much as you want, man."
53:25;53:26;"How does that feel?"
53:26;53:29;"When I hear those stories, that really throws me off kilter."
53:29;53:36;"You know, it's funny, too, is like when people talk about relationships, one of the classic cliches that people talk about is I don't want to die alone."
53:36;53:38;"You're going to are like in a breakup."
53:38;53:40;"You don't know how to you don't know how to do it."
53:40;53:41;"You're going to die alone."
53:41;53:42;"It's like in a movie or something."
53:42;53:43;"You're going to die alone."
53:43;53:44;"Yeah, I am."
53:44;53:45;"We all die alone."
53:45;53:46;"No, you don't have to die alone."
53:46;53:51;"You could die surrounded by family when you enter purgatory and go to heaven or hell."
53:51;53:56;"That will be alone or it'll be just you and St. Peter or Lord Satan."
53:56;53:58;"But you don't have to die alone."
53:58;53:59;"That phrase has multiple meanings."
53:59;54:00;"But anyway, go ahead."
54:00;54:03;"When you enter the afterlife, you might be alone."
54:03;54:08;"But then you enter the black nothingness of zero consciousness and your body rots in the ground."
54:08;54:10;"Oh, well, that's a pessimistic view."
54:10;54:12;"I think then you'll be alone for about five minutes."
54:12;54:17;"Then you'll meet your ancestors and go get a slice of pizza."
54:17;54:20;"So people always that's this big fear that most people have."
54:20;54:22;"I don't want to die alone."
54:22;54:24;"Or it's a harsh thing to say to somebody."
54:24;54:25;"You're going to die alone."
54:25;54:27;"In movies, they always say that like, you don't know what."
54:27;54:31;"So I can't imagine saying that."
54:31;54:33;"You know what?"
54:33;54:35;"Yeah, you're going to die alone."
54:35;54:38;"I mean, in movies, that's what I'm trying to accomplish here by breaking up with you."
54:38;54:44;"Right. I'd rather die alone than live another eight years with you and then die when I'm 81."
54:44;54:45;"I'm 73."
54:45;54:48;"I'm going to I'm bringing up with you now we're divorcing."
54:48;54:49;"I'd rather die alone."
54:49;54:51;"Thank you. I mean, it's brutal."
54:51;54:55;"The price of freedom oftentimes is somebody else's heartbreak."
54:55;55:00;"Just like the price of American freedom is a lack of freedom for many people around the world."
55:00;55:01;"Also true."
55:01;55:02;"Maybe that's what Tom was thinking about."
55:02;55:10;"But, yeah, so this idea of dying alone, like to be in your 60s or 70s and be like, you're rolling the dice hard."
55:10;55:12;"Yeah, because you might not meet somebody else."
55:12;55:15;"And you're like you're saying yourself, I'd rather die alone."
55:15;55:19;"I'd rather just I don't know what you read."
55:19;55:21;"Yeah, I play golf, watch TV."
55:21;55:26;"Even like the most like bawling social people in their 70s."
55:26;55:30;"Their social calendar is not morning to night packed."
55:30;55:31;"Nope."
55:31;55:33;"OK. Let's get in the third verse."
55:33;55:57;"Free. Free."
55:57;56:06;"Oh, this part's so dope."
56:06;56:08;"I wonder if Jeff Lynn's singing in there."
56:08;56:14;"Oh, it might be."
56:14;56:16;"Such a simple interlude."
56:16;56:20;"It's kind of slow, too, when you really think about it."
56:20;56:21;"The snare."
56:21;56:24;"Military drums."
56:24;56:26;"Oh, he wants to go to L.A."
56:26;56:27;"Right over Mulholland."
56:27;56:44;"Well."
56:44;56:46;"That's my favorite verse."
56:46;56:52;"It also makes me think of Lebowski to bring it back to the beginning of the show when the dream sequence when the dude is on the carpet."
56:52;56:56;"He's going over L.A. and all of a sudden he just free falls."
56:56;56:57;"Yeah."
56:57;56:59;"Fade into like the weird bowling alley nightmare."
56:59;57:00;"Oh, yeah."
57:00;57:03;"OK, so here he says, I want to glide down over Mulholland."
57:03;57:10;"So, again, to listeners who are not familiar with L.A. geography, every verse has something about L.A. geography."
57:10;57:11;"So she lives in Reseda."
57:11;57:12;"That's in the valley."
57:12;57:14;"That's across the mountains from L.A."
57:14;57:16;"Talks about Ventura Boulevard."
57:16;57:17;"That's also in the valley."
57:17;57:18;"That's a commercial thing."
57:18;57:22;"Now, Mulholland is interesting because Mulholland is the street."
57:22;57:23;"There's like Mulholland Drive."
57:23;57:25;"People probably heard of the David Lynch movie."
57:25;57:28;"That's a famous L.A. street."
57:28;57:34;"Really what it is, if you look at L.A., it's like L.A. is this big flat expanse and then you have mountains."
57:34;57:35;"Santa Monica Mountains."
57:36;57:38;"And then you have the valley on the other side."
57:38;57:43;"So at the very top of the Santa Monica Mountains is a street called Mulholland."
57:43;57:44;"It snakes along the spine."
57:44;57:46;"It's, yeah, the very top."
57:46;57:52;"In some ways, you could call Mulholland the dividing line between Los Angeles and the valley."
57:52;58:00;"So when he says, ""I want to glide down over Mulholland,"" he's talking about crossing this line between L.A.,"
58:00;58:03;"the glittering city of dreams, and the valley."
58:03;58:04;"The drab suburbs."
58:04;58:05;"Drab suburbs."
58:05;58:06;"Okay, so it's interesting."
58:06;58:08;"You were saying that he's saying he wants to go to L.A."
58:08;58:09;"This is one thing that I had."
58:09;58:15;"Tom is a dude, or the narrator, let's call him Tom, is a dude from the valley."
58:15;58:16;"High school sweetheart."
58:16;58:18;"She's a good girl."
58:18;58:20;"And then he's a bad boy."
58:20;58:21;"Cheats on her or whatever."
58:21;58:27;"He breaks her heart because--and at first he doesn't even miss her because he just wants freedom so badly."
58:27;58:30;"He knows she's great, but he just can't hang."
58:30;58:32;"And then he goes into free fall."
58:32;58:37;"So I'm kind of picturing in a way that she's stuck back in the valley with the vampires and stuff,"
58:37;58:39;"and maybe he moved to L.A. or something."
58:39;58:42;"I'm almost picturing like--this is not the story the video tells."
58:42;58:43;"He started a band."
58:43;58:44;"He's playing."
58:44;58:47;"I'm almost picturing that, that like she's this good girl who likes Elvis."
58:47;58:49;"She's with this dude."
58:49;58:51;"He just unceremoniously dumps her."
58:51;58:53;"She thought they were going to be together forever."
58:53;58:56;"He unceremoniously dumps her because he's pursuing bigger dreams."
58:56;58:58;"He's starting a power pop band in L.A."
58:58;58:59;"He's starting a power pop band."
58:59;59:01;"Playing gigs on the strip."
59:01;59:02;"He's playing gigs on the Sunset Strip."
59:02;59:05;"He crosses Mulholland, the dividing line."
59:05;59:08;"He's in the city now, and he's living that freedom."
59:08;59:12;"But sometimes at night when he gets back from a sick gig,"
59:12;59:15;"Benmont Tench ripping it up on the keys,"
59:15;59:16;"now things get quiet."
59:16;59:19;"He has a kind of dark night of the soul, and he thinks,"
59:19;59:22;"""Wow, it's been pretty cool moving to L.A. and having to start a power pop band,"
59:22;59:26;"but as free as I feel, sometimes I almost feel like I'm free falling."
59:26;59:28;"This is all happening so fast."
59:28;59:29;"It's weird."
59:29;59:32;"I'm a--and then he says, ""Maybe I'm a piece of [bleep]."""
59:32;59:37;"Like he just signed a big record deal, and then he thinks back to the girl back home,"
59:37;59:40;"and he's like--everybody's telling him, like, ""Tom, you're so great."
59:40;59:43;"Love your new power pop aesthetic."
59:43;59:45;"It's a little classic rock, a little new wave."""
59:45;59:46;"I'm hearing some Dylan in there too."
59:46;59:47;"I'm hearing a little Dylan in there."
59:47;59:50;"He kind of taking me back to the birds."
59:50;59:51;"And everybody's pumping him up."
59:51;59:53;"Big Gene Clark fan."
59:53;59:54;"Yeah."
59:54;59:57;"Stan Lynch just killing it on the drums."
59:57;59:58;"I hope he's your drummer forever."
59:58;01:00:01;"And he's getting hyped up, and then he has this dark night of the soul"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"where he's like--thinks back to this girl whose heart he broke."
01:00:04;01:00:08;"He's just getting back to his apartment, opening that fridge, just the jar of mayonnaise."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Right."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Exactly."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"That's it."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Single Budweiser."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Right."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Five of the six beers in the six-pack gone."
01:00:15;01:00:19;"That's like the symbol of male freedom in America is like a [bleep] fridge."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Yeah."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Just filthy [bleep] fridge."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"All right, man."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"You want to go be a bad boy?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"You want to break up with a nice girl?"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"You want to move to L.A.?"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"You want to go be a rock star?"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Okay."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"That probably feels pretty good when you're up on stage with Mike Campbell next to you."
01:00:33;01:00:36;"But what about when you get home to that empty apartment"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"and just look at that jar of mayonnaise?"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Then maybe recede doesn't seem that bad."
01:00:40;01:00:45;"I also love--I love in songs when people go between the general stuff and then ""I."""
01:00:45;01:00:47;"Tom Petty's really good at that too."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"I feel like WAC songwriters, it's ""I, I, I, I."""
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Yeah."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"And he knows how to kind of paint a scene and then get personal again."
01:00:53;01:00:58;"So with this kind of emotional final verse, now he's really telling us how he feels."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"Because in the beginning he said, ""I'm a bad boy. I don't even miss her."""
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Yeah, right."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"We know you miss her, Tom."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Stop frontin'."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"So now he's saying, ""I want to glide down over Mulholland."""
01:01:06;01:01:09;"I'm picturing him, apartment on the Sunset Strip,"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"thinking back to that girl over the mountain."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"And he almost is envisioning a big Lebowski-esque dream sequence"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"where he flies up over the mountains, glides down over Mulholland."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"He's back in the homeland in the valley."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"She's only like 15 miles away."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Right."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Yeah, glide down."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"Different world though."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Right, yeah, a different world."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"It's like Jersey and New York."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"Exactly."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"He almost wants to return to the scene of the crime"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"where this broken-hearted girl was left."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"He wishes he could glide down."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"And it's a fantasy."
01:01:35;01:01:40;"That's also why he says, ""I want to drive up over Mulholland."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I want to write her a letter."""
01:01:43;01:01:45;"He's painting a fantastical thing."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"I want to glide down over Mulholland."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"I really picture him flying."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Yeah."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"I want to write her name in the sky."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Now he's keeping it real."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"He does miss her."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"He's going to free fall into nothing? Is that right?"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"I'm going to free fall out into nothing."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Going to leave this world for a while."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"So that's like really harsh."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"World for a while."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"That kills me."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Is he shooting up? What is he doing?"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"Getting hammered?"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"Oh, you know what? That's a good interpretation."
01:02:04;01:02:08;"Yeah, and I guess Tom Petty was known to have had some problems"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"with heroin and stuff, so who knows?"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Really? I didn't know that."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"Yeah, you did."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"Maybe not in this period."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Practice period."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"I mean '70s."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"I mean everyone."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"Right, a lot of rockers had substance abuse problems."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"So maybe he means that, but it's also like this is where I think"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"you kind of--to me, you really get the whole story of the song"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"is like he's almost like nihilistic now."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"It's like so here's a guy who had the choice to be free."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"He took that choice."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"He got freedom."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"He broke a heart along the way, and he's free, but he's free falling,"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"and you're kind of like, whoa, is free falling fun?"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Is it like skydiving?"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Is it worth it?"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"I think this is where he explains what free falling is."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"I'm going to free fall out into nothing."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"I'm going to leave this world for a while."
01:02:47;01:02:52;"It's almost like he mainlined freedom, and it really makes him want to like"
01:02:52;01:02:57;"die almost or maybe like just get [bleep] up on drugs and like check out."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"But it's like freedom is this like harsh thing."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Yeah, and the freedom that a rock star buys is extreme,"
01:03:03;01:03:09;"and it's cool that he doesn't lean on the rock star trope heavily at all."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"This song could apply to someone that just has a normal gig"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"and just broke up with someone and is like aimless."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"I love that too."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"It's relatable."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"It's not just like being a rock star is hard."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"I live in a gilded cage."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"Yeah, like that movie Somewhere."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Right."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Where that guy's just like a rock star and he lives at the chateau,"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"and you're like, do I care about this character?"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"It's depressing to be rich."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Yeah."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Yeah, no, this is like--"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"I'm a multimillionaire."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"This song could apply to any human being--"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:03:38;01:03:41;"--who made a decision to buy themselves freedom,"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"but that carried with it an emotional weight."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"And there's a dark night of the soul that probably everybody has."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"It's like sometimes you're free, sometimes you're free falling."
01:03:49;01:03:53;"And in this final verse, he's talking about when you have that feeling of free falling."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"He wants to free fall out into nothing, leave this world for a while."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"It's harsh."
01:03:57;01:04:00;"You're right about it being similar to Born in the USA too,"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"where the chorus is like--at first read, the chorus is triumphant."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"Right."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"But if you think about it a little bit and take in the verses,"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"Born in the USA, and then I'm free, free falling."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"They're both like very bittersweet."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"Yeah, they're easy to yell in a group and feel like pumped up."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Anthemic."
01:04:19;01:04:23;"Yeah, and I really feel like Tom wanted to let us know in this final verse"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"what free falling really means, and he leaves it on just such a dark note."
01:04:28;01:04:31;"Because really, there's more chorus, but that's the final--"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Damn."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"That's the final verse."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"I'm going to free fall out into nothing, going to leave this world for a while."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Sounds like suicidal."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"Almost, man."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Yeah."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"You broke that good girl's heart, man."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"Now you're almost questioning the point of living."
01:04:45;01:04:49;"♪"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"And then just kind of a good breakdown chorus."
01:04:51;01:04:55;"♪"
01:04:55;01:05:00;"♪"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"I also just kind of love that this is like his biggest song."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"He's this classic American songwriter,"
01:05:31;01:05:36;"and his biggest song is about the two sides of freedom."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"I love that."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"It's just like real American poetry."
01:05:39;01:05:43;"So confident, too, to write something so simple and straightforward"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"and not try to make it arty."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Right, he's great at that."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"The choruses are always straightforward."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"I won't back down."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"It takes courage to just do something really straightforward, you know,"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"and be like, ""This isn't the hippest thing,"""
01:05:55;01:05:59;"but I guess he was 39 at the time, had nothing to prove, which is great."
01:05:59;01:06:02;"Although it was his solo album, so he was stepping out on his own."
01:06:02;01:06:06;"It's cool that his solo album did so well, and it's big."
01:06:06;01:06:11;"It's like when Bruce made his first solo record without the E Street Band,"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"the Tunnel of Love album in '87--"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Not his first, but his first studio record."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"--which was a great record, but it was definitely like the energy"
01:06:19;01:06:23;"of the whole Bruce Springsteen project sort of diminished a little bit."
01:06:23;01:06:26;"It wasn't like a smash hit the way Full Moon was."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Yeah, it's a great album, but it's more like Bruce being like,"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"""Enough with the big stuff. I just want to get more personal."""
01:06:31;01:06:34;"And Tom kind of had it both ways, which is very cool."
01:06:34;01:06:37;"So we got Josh Ells calling in now."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"Tom and Bruce."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"Tom and Bruce. It all comes back to Tom and Bruce."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"We got Josh Ells calling in, who's a journalist, writes for Rolling Stone,"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"among other places, who wrote a big story on Tom Petty a few years ago."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"So he dug into his notes, and he's going to talk to us a little bit."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Somebody actually spent time with the man."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"We're going deep."
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"[phone ringing]"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Hey, what's up, Josh?"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"What's up, Evan? How you doing?"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Not bad. Long time no see."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"I should point out that Josh once profiled Vampire Weekend for Rolling Stone."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"Yes, full disclosure."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"What year?"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"That was on our second album, so it must have been 2010 or so."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Contra era."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Contra era of Vampire."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"That sounds right."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"So you wrote a big piece on Tom Petty when?"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"June of 2014 was when I was with him, and then it came out a couple months later."
01:07:23;01:07:26;"Oh, so pretty recently, actually."
01:07:26;01:07:31;"So when a Rolling Stone journalist is writing a profile of a major musician like Tom Petty,"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"how does it work?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Are you hanging with him?"
01:07:34;01:07:39;"You getting 30 minutes on the phone and then calling up Ben Mond to fill in the blanks?"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"How does it work?"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"I did get Ben Mond on the phone from Rome, which was pretty dope."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"But no, we hung."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"I should point out, full disclosure, that I do work mostly for Rolling Stone,"
01:07:49;01:07:53;"but the Petty profile is actually for Men's Journal magazine."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"But it works the same way."
01:07:55;01:08:01;"Basically, there was a publicist who was like, ""Hey, this is when you're going to be there."""
01:08:01;01:08:04;"And I think I talked to someone from his management company, too."
01:08:04;01:08:09;"It's this very sweet woman named Mary, who I think had worked with him for like 40 years."
01:08:09;01:08:15;"And they were just like, ""Show up at his house in Malibu, and then you guys will just hang."""
01:08:15;01:08:22;"So I ended up spending most of two days with him, probably like five or six hours each day."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"That's a lot of time."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Yeah, he was just down."
01:08:25;01:08:30;"I've actually found with a lot of these older, just the real legend dudes that they're actually super easy."
01:08:30;01:08:36;"Because I think, A, he's from an era where, you know, almost famous era,"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"where people would just come hang for like a week."
01:08:38;01:08:42;"So it wasn't to like get on the phone for half an hour or like meet for lunch somewhere."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"It was just like, ""Let's come chop it up."""
01:08:44;01:08:47;"And also, he just like didn't have much going on."
01:08:47;01:08:51;"I mean, he was in between--he'd finished making the record that they put out that year,"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"and then they were still a couple months from touring."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"So he was just kind of chilling at his house in Malibu."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"That's cool that he let you actually come to his house."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"Because, yeah, maybe you're right."
01:09:01;01:09:05;"Like he came from this era where you get like Cameron Crowe jumps on the tour bus for a week."
01:09:05;01:09:08;"So they're like, ""All right, let's get to know this journalist."""
01:09:08;01:09:13;"Because one thing that I'm sure you're familiar with, and maybe sometimes you're in this position,"
01:09:13;01:09:17;"that I always find funny as somebody who's like, you know, done a few interviews"
01:09:17;01:09:25;"and knows a lot of journalists and stuff is when you read some big profile of a actor or a musician or something,"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"and it's like, ""I met them in the lobby of this hotel where they ordered this."""
01:09:29;01:09:33;"And there's like these details about what's happening in the lobby and what they ordered."
01:09:33;01:09:36;"And I remember when I was a kid and I'd read something and I'd be like, ""Wow."
01:09:36;01:09:39;"I guess they stay at that hotel a lot or something."""
01:09:39;01:09:43;"And then you just realize like they literally came to town to do a day of interviews."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"One after another, they're sitting in this restaurant in a hotel they've never been at in their life."
01:09:47;01:09:51;"And like the idea that you're taking meaning from that is so harsh."
01:09:51;01:09:56;"Just like at the Bowery Hotel, I sat down with Florence and the Machine"
01:09:56;01:10:01;"as they chomped down on an artisanal broccoli rabe pizza."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"And you're like painting a picture and you're like for them, they're like bewildered."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"They like just got off a plane. They're like at some--you know."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"That's their favorite hotel. You didn't know that?"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"And even if it is their favorite hotel, it still like says so little about them."
01:10:12;01:10:17;"So anyway, as I've gotten older, you kind of read the profiles where you can tell the journalist"
01:10:17;01:10:23;"is doing their best to paint a picture when they sat down at a random hotel restaurant"
01:10:23;01:10:27;"for 45 minutes with a jet-lagged person who doesn't even know where they are."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"And you kind of forget that the publicist is standing right there."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"They're like, ""They came down. They have no idea where they are."""
01:10:32;01:10:37;"And we just started talking versus something like this where you actually go see this dude's house."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"You're literally seeing his environment."
01:10:39;01:10:45;"Yeah, totally. I mean, I feel like way more often than I like, my job is trying to disguise"
01:10:45;01:10:49;"all that stuff that you were just talking about, like trying to make 45 minutes at the Bowery Hotel"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"with Lawrence and the Machine not feel like 45 minutes."
01:10:53;01:10:58;"But yeah, I feel like a lot of my job is trying to hide that or just like right around it in a way,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"disguise how artificial the whole thing was."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"But yeah, he really was just open."
01:11:03;01:11:07;"And I mean, he didn't--he wasn't like showing me around his bedroom."
01:11:07;01:11:10;"And I didn't get to crash there, so it wasn't fully just like, ""Hey, come--"""
01:11:10;01:11:12;"So he didn't give you a tour?"
01:11:12;01:11:16;"I'm trying to remember, actually. I feel like I asked, and he just kind of--I don't know."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"He changed the subject somehow."
01:11:17;01:11:22;"Also, the flip side of the old dudes is like they've done this so much that they can be really slick"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"about like sharing what they want to share and not sharing what they want to share."
01:11:25;01:11:29;"Right. You'll ask a question, and he'll just say exactly what he wants to say."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Yeah."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"So you get to his house."
01:11:31;01:11:34;"He was back in his home studio just like rocking out."
01:11:34;01:11:41;"He had a stepson who was like in his 20s, and his stepson had this friend who was like going through a hard time."
01:11:41;01:11:45;"And Petty kind of took this kid under his wing and brought him out on tour."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"It was actually really sweet."
01:11:46;01:11:50;"I mean, it's those little things that really show you who a person is"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"and the fact that he was not doing this for any kind of public goodwill."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"It was just like a nice thing to do."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"So he kind of like semi-adopted this kid."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"So Petty brought this kid out on tour, and then he got really into music and started playing guitar,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"and he formed his own band."
01:12:05;01:12:10;"And then so Petty was actually producing his stepson's friend's band."
01:12:10;01:12:13;"Oh, that's tight. Tom Petty just willing to give his time."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Yeah. I mean, that was one of the things that I found super cool about him"
01:12:16;01:12:22;"was he did not seem jaded in the slightest, and he was like, ""You know, I love doing this,"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"and I get inspiration from these guys."""
01:12:24;01:12:28;"And yeah, I mean, that could sound super corny or like saccharine or something,"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"but he was just psyched to be making music with some young kids"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"and that they were making rock music."
01:12:33;01:12:38;"And I got the sense that anytime he could be in a studio with whoever, he was pretty stoked."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"So what else did you learn about Tom from spending that time with him?"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"We heard that he's a pretty big stoner."
01:12:43;01:12:46;"I mean, he wrote a lot of songs about smoking weed."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"Yeah, he smoked a lot of weed."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"So even when the journalist comes over, he's still getting high?"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"Yeah, I don't know how high."
01:12:55;01:12:59;"I mean, I think he just sort of maintained a baseline high that maybe wasn't even high."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"That was just like Tom Petty."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"Smoking joints, pipe, bong, what, vaping?"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"No, he was vaping. I was really surprised."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"He was vaping?"
01:13:08;01:13:12;"Yeah, he was vaping, and he was just kind of like--it was just sort of all day."
01:13:12;01:13:16;"So all day he's just hitting that vape a little bit, but he's not noticeably high."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Wake and bake."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"He talked about how he was kind of spacey sometimes."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"I didn't notice because I had never met Tom Petty, so I don't know that I would have--"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Oh, he referred to himself as spacey?"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"Yeah, yeah, yeah. He actually said he stopped driving."
01:13:28;01:13:33;"He's like, ""I'm too spacey,"" while he puffed on his 15th hit of his vape pen that day."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"Well, if you're hitting a vape pen 15 times a day, you probably shouldn't drive."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"Tom Petty, he was such a cool, mellow dude."
01:13:40;01:13:46;"He's such an icon of just a chill, cool dude, and it's great to hear that he's actually a nice guy too."
01:13:46;01:13:51;"And I would feel like he was very underrated in terms of the music stoner canon."
01:13:51;01:13:56;"People know that he smokes weed, but it's like he might have smoked as much weed as Willie Nelson or something,"
01:13:56;01:14:01;"but I feel like he wasn't out there throwing pot leaves on CDs or anything."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"It wasn't part of his identity."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"That's cool. Just a dude who smokes."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Yeah, totally. I was surprised by this. He's super into history."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"He was a real World War II buff."
01:14:11;01:14:16;"He knew a frightening amount about the JFK assassination, and he was a real conspiracy theorist."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"He definitely was more than one dude."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"Oh, for real?"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"Yeah, yeah. He had a lot of thoughts."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"But he told me he's super into Thomas Jefferson."
01:14:23;01:14:27;"He said one of his favorite things to do whenever he was in D.C. would be,"
01:14:27;01:14:35;"""So I'll wait until it's really late at night, and I'll go get Superstone and go sit at the Jefferson Memorial and just read walls."""
01:14:35;01:14:38;"So I just pictured Tom Petty sitting at the foot of that giant statue,"
01:14:38;01:14:42;"just super spaced and reading the wisdom of one of the founders of our country."
01:14:42;01:14:49;"Can you imagine just like you're on an eighth grade school field trip, you and some of the bad kids sneak out of the hotel,"
01:14:49;01:14:56;"get past the teacher, somebody has a fake ID, you get some beers, and you're just walking around empty D.C."
01:14:56;01:15:01;"And then you roll up on some empty monument or something, there's nobody there,"
01:15:01;01:15:06;"and then you just see this thin blonde man hitting a weed vape."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"""Yo, is that Tom Petty?"""
01:15:09;01:15:11;"""Don't mind me."""
01:15:11;01:15:13;"That'd be sick."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"We were kind of doing an interpretation of ""Free Fallen"" and talking about how"
01:15:16;01:15:22;"it seems like a very personal song that's about the price that an individual pays for freedom,"
01:15:22;01:15:27;"whether that's leaving a broken heart behind or whatever, feeling like you're free fallen."
01:15:27;01:15:31;"But we were also talking about how that kind of intersects with this American idea of freedom."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"What's the price that America pays for freedom?"
01:15:34;01:15:38;"Maybe that's how Thomas Jefferson felt after he wrote the Declaration of Independence."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"America's free, but..."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"At what cost?"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"A cost borne by others."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"Exactly."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"So Petty was pretty down on America."
01:15:47;01:15:53;"He just went on kind of a diatribe about how we were living in a very anti-intellectual moment,"
01:15:53;01:15:57;"and Fox News was like banana republic sh*t,"
01:15:57;01:16:02;"and he wasn't so optimistic about our collective ability to make smart decisions."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Oh, damn."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"This is two years before Trump."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Oh yeah, that's even before Trump."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"Well, that's good to hear, because we want to believe that Tom Petty's on the right side of freedom."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"And also, one thing I want to say about Tom Petty, too, is like,"
01:16:12;01:16:15;"we always try to check ourselves on this show, like,"
01:16:15;01:16:19;"Jake and I are both born into Northeastern and liberal families."
01:16:19;01:16:24;"It's not particularly hard for us to be like, f*ck Trump."
01:16:24;01:16:28;"But one interesting thing about Tom Petty is like, he's like this deeply Southern dude."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"He kind of wrestled with his Southern identity, because he famously did a tour for an album"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"that was kind of about the South, an album called Southern Accents,"
01:16:36;01:16:41;"and he had a Confederate flag on stage, because this album was supposed to be about Southern heritage."
01:16:41;01:16:46;"And, you know, in the 80s, it wasn't quite the hot-button topic it was today,"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"or at least there wasn't the internet for people to discuss it in the same way."
01:16:49;01:16:53;"And he's one of the few dudes, later in life he fully disavowed it, and he's like,"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"I shouldn't have done that."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"Whatever that flag might mean to my heritage, it's not right."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"It means too many other horrible things."
01:16:59;01:17:04;"There really is like this deep compassion and complexity beneath the surface of Tom Petty, I think."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Yeah, totally."
01:17:05;01:17:09;"If I remember correctly, him using the flag was like slightly nuanced."
01:17:09;01:17:13;"So even in the 80s, he was trying to make a nuanced point, although obviously,"
01:17:13;01:17:17;"I'm sure to a lot of people, they were like, alright, even if that is the case,"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"we're not trying to see the Confederate flag on stage."
01:17:19;01:17:25;"But at least, because you see other guys from that era, not to make excuses for them,"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"but just as a point of comparison, you have these other guys from the era,"
01:17:27;01:17:32;"some of these older classic rock dudes are some of the most like crotchety, racist,"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"just like, don't you tell me what to do, like kind of taking all the wrong things away"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"from like the rock ethos."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"Freedom."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Yeah, like the wrong type of freedom."
01:17:40;01:17:44;"So you probably shouldn't have done it in the first place, but like we will give Tom Petty"
01:17:44;01:17:48;"some credit for like actually reckoning with that and apologizing for it."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Well, thanks so much for calling in, Josh."
01:17:50;01:17:55;"We really appreciate getting some more personal perspective on the man, Tom Petty."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Thank you guys for having me."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Alright, thanks for calling in, dude."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"I'll have you again soon."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Have a good one, man."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Time Crisis."
01:18:01;01:18:05;"I was talking with a friend of mine, said the woman that hurt his pride,"
01:18:05;01:18:09;"told him that she loved him so, and turned around and let him go."
01:18:09;01:18:13;"Then he said you better watch your step, or you're gonna get hurt yourself."
01:18:13;01:18:17;"Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size."
01:18:17;01:18:21;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"Oh, I love you, baby, don't do me like that."
01:18:25;01:18:29;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:18:29;01:18:33;"Someday I might need you, baby, don't do me like that."
01:18:33;01:18:38;"Listen, little kid, you see, maybe you will bury me,"
01:18:38;01:18:42;"if you were in a public eye, give it someone else a try."
01:18:42;01:18:46;"You know you better watch your step, or you're gonna get hurt yourself."
01:18:46;01:18:50;"Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size."
01:18:50;01:18:54;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:18:54;01:18:59;"Oh, I love you, baby, don't, don't, don't, don't."
01:18:59;01:19:03;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:19:03;01:19:07;"What if I need you, baby, don't do me like that."
01:19:07;01:19:10;"'Cause somewhere deep down inside, someone will say,"
01:19:10;01:19:15;"love doesn't last that long."
01:19:15;01:19:19;"I've had this feeling inside, night and day,"
01:19:19;01:19:25;"I never can get that easy no more."
01:19:25;01:19:29;"Listen, little kid, you see, maybe you will bury me,"
01:19:29;01:19:33;"if you were in a public eye, give it someone else a try."
01:19:33;01:19:37;"And you know you better watch your step, or you're gonna get hurt yourself."
01:19:37;01:19:41;"Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size."
01:19:41;01:19:45;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:19:45;01:19:50;"Oh, I love you, baby, don't, don't, don't, don't."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"I just might need you, honey, don't do me like that."
01:19:58;01:20:02;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:20:02;01:20:06;"Baby, baby, baby, don't, don't, don't, don't."
01:20:06;01:20:10;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that."
01:20:10;01:20:14;"Baby, baby, baby, oh, oh, oh."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"All right, you ready for the top five?"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"I'm ready."
01:20:17;01:20:23;"It's time for the top five, five on iTunes."
01:20:23;01:20:28;"So we're gonna compare this week's top five with 1981."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Why 1981?"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"I don't know."
01:20:31;01:20:36;"Because that was the year of Tom Petty's highest charting single."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Okay."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"And what was Tom Petty's highest charting single?"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"The answer may surprise you."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"You probably think it's Free Fallin'."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Yeah, or like Refugee or--"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Nope."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"'81, though, that's--Refugee's '70s."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"'81, I want to think like,"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"The waitin' is the hardest part."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"No, Tom Petty's highest charting single"
01:20:56;01:20:59;"was as a feature with Stevie Nicks."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"Okay."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"So anyway, the number five song in 1981,"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"Sheena Easton, ""For Your Eyes Only,"""
01:21:07;01:21:10;"which I think this is from a James Bond movie."
01:21:15;01:21:18;"My brothers will be born in two months."

01:22:53;01:22:54;"Okay."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Schmaltzy, that was a weak era for James Bond, too,"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"early '80s Bond."

01:23:03;01:23:07;"Something about early '80s Bond is like really off."

01:23:09;01:23:11;"'90s and 2000s."

01:23:15;01:23:17;"Solid Bond, yeah."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"GoldenEye, great video game."

01:23:55;01:23:57;"I was like, what?"
01:23:57;01:24:02;"He posts up like some weird, belligerent hermit with a shotgun."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"And it's like, this is-- what?"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"I don't like this."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"It's losing-- it has lost some identity."
01:24:07;01:24:11;"I want him sneaking into cool mansions and stuff."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"It lost that touch of elegance that you liked."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Keep those movies PG."
01:24:14;01:24:17;"Hey, when are we going to get an American Bond?"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"That's what I want to know."
01:24:19;01:24:21;"God, who would that be?"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"The Rock."

01:24:36;01:24:38;"Is he doing a British accent?"
01:24:38;01:24:39;"No, he's just American."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"He grew up in America, but then his dad"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"got transferred to Great Britain when he was like 14."
01:24:44;01:24:48;"So he had like a fully solidified American accent,"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"never picked up the British accent,"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"and then just goes in to intelligence."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"The Rock was a Rhodes Scholar."

01:25:03;01:25:05;"And then he was a Rhodes Scholar, so he went to Oxford."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"And he was so bummed out that nobody knew how to play football."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"And they were like, why don't you try rugby?"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"And then he really started showing-- starting his stuff"
01:25:12;01:25:16;"on the rugby field, and he caught the attention of MI6."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Yeah."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"And instead of an Aston Martin or like a BMW,"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"it's like a Jeep, red Cherokee or something."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"Like a Hummer."

01:25:46;01:25:48;"It's like it's just this endless cycle of this guy"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"called James Bond."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"The story is like nonsense."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"Yeah."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"It'd be cool if they were just like-- for once,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"they made a movie that recognized the fact that James"
01:25:55;01:25:59;"Bond is like constantly being-- is this identity that's"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"passed from person to person."

01:26:14;01:26:18;"They're like, yes, we have had many British James Bonds."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"But this-- this mission requires somebody"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"with an impeccable American accent."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"You have to be the James Bond."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"It's like King Ralph."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Remember that movie where John Goodman"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"becomes king of England?"

01:30:54;01:30:56;"It feel like my life ain't mine."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Who can relate?"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"Woo!"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"I've been on the low."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"I've been taking my time."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"I feel like I'm out of my mind."
01:31:04;01:31:08;"I saw some tweet kind of in the aftermath of Las Vegas"
01:31:08;01:31:11;"that was like some conservative dude weighing in"
01:31:11;01:31:15;"on gun violence and the deaths caused by guns."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"And this guy's just dead-ass serious."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"You know, first of all, everybody should recognize"
01:31:20;01:31:25;"that actually 66% of deaths by gun are actually suicide."
01:31:25;01:31:28;"So, you know, like as if that's like a good point,"
01:31:28;01:31:32;"as if you could say 66% of gun deaths are suicide."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"So it's all good."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"It's all good, man."
01:31:35;01:31:37;"And also, I was reading, there's so much information"
01:31:37;01:31:41;"that suggests that obviously there's times where people are--"
01:31:41;01:31:44;"of course, some people make a decision to kill themselves,"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"and maybe there's very little we can do about it."
01:31:46;01:31:50;"You know, it's horrible, but like maybe it's impossible"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"to get the suicide rate to 0%."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"But there's so much information that suggests"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"that a lot of people who are struggling with something"
01:31:57;01:32:00;"or depressed, they are feeling suicidal,"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"but the actual moment they choose to kill themselves"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"is kind of a split-second decision."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"Impulsive."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"And if you don't have a gun, the likelihood of you actually,"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"you know, going through with it plummets."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"And there's a lot of information about places"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"that implemented programs like in militaries"
01:32:17;01:32:20;"where you're not allowed to have your gun with you all the time."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"There's something like the Israeli military said"
01:32:22;01:32:25;"that soldiers couldn't take the guns back to their barracks,"
01:32:25;01:32:29;"and the suicide rate in the military went down by 40% or something."
01:32:29;01:32:33;"I've read those stories too, like people that attempted suicide"
01:32:33;01:32:37;"and lived, a lot of them report like,"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"""Oh yeah, as soon as I was into that process,"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"like once I jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge"
01:32:43;01:32:47;"and was plummeting to my death, I was like--"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I instantly felt this regret."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Yeah, it's a fully different category than like"
01:32:51;01:32:55;"the Dr. Kevorkian terminal illness style"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"where somebody makes that deep decision."

01:54:07;01:54:08;"Yeah."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"It's an interesting way of looking at it."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"And one thing they would always do in that show"
01:54:11;01:54:14;"is end with, like, some dramatic pop song of the time"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"to, like, really drive home, like, an emotional point."
01:54:16;01:54:19;"So I'm picturing just, like, in 30 years--"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"Wow."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"--when somebody's making, like--"
