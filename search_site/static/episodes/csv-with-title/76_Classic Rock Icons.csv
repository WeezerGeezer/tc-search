00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis. Guess who's back? On this week's episode we discuss the new Eminem"
00:08;00:16;"album. We also dig into Seinfeld 2000's origin story. All this plus pumping your"
00:16;00:21;"gas in New Jersey, hiking in the Sawtooth Mountains, and the greatest hits"
00:21;00:30;"of 1977 and today. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis back again. Is the summer over yet? Yeah, Labor Day. But what about the"
01:20;01:26;"solstice? Is it the fall solstice? When does fall start? Like September 20-something. Maybe"
01:26;01:29;"people should talk about it more like that because summer's over but fall"
01:29;01:33;"hasn't started yet. You know what we're in? Indian summer. Wait, what does Indian"
01:33;01:38;"summer refer to? This period of time. The end? In the year. I was gonna say we"
01:38;01:42;"should call it the days between. Wait, what is that a reference to? That was like a"
01:42;01:47;"very late Grateful Dead song. Oh yeah dude. Considered one of the last great"
01:47;01:51;"Garcia-Hunter collaborations. The sentiment in a funny way makes me think"
01:51;01:55;"of the song that you put me on to. That Moody Blues song from the 80s. Their kind"
01:55;02:00;"of comeback song. Oh, Only in Dreams? No, not Only in Dreams. Your Wildest Dreams."
02:00;02:03;"Your Wildest Dreams. And I mean this is very fun but they're both about kind of like"
02:03;02:07;"dudes from the 60s looking back at life a little bit and they have this like"
02:07;02:12;"this is a lighter song but anyway. Sometimes people refer to August 1st to"
02:12;02:17;"August 8th as the days between Jerry's birthday and death day."
02:32;02:37;"Oh this song is dope. Yeah, I remember. I never heard it. You put me on to this. Did I?"
02:37;02:39;"Yeah."
02:39;03:00;"Anyway, we're in a funny interim period. The summer is gone but it's not quite"
03:00;03:04;"fall yet. Especially if you don't go to school anymore. Right. Because when your"
03:04;03:08;"kid's summer's over you're in school. That's a new thing but you're an adult."
03:08;03:11;"It's like you know in your heart summer's gone but it's not autumn yet either."
03:11;03:17;"Summer just seems like a season of missed opportunities. Yeah. Because when"
03:17;03:20;"you're an adult you're like oh it's summer I got to be doing all this fun"
03:20;03:24;"stuff and then you're like I'm in my life though. Right. Early to mid-September"
03:24;03:29;"strange time. It's a strange transitional moment. Yeah I mean collectively the"
03:29;03:34;"whole society is like okay back to work. Yeah."
03:34;03:52;"All right. I've got a lot on my mind. What's going on? I've got a lot of s*** that I've been"
03:52;03:57;"wanting to talk about. I saw my good buddy Wes Miles the other day. He was in"
03:57;04:02;"town with his band Ra Ra Riot. Mm-hmm. And you know me and Wes have been friends since"
04:02;04:05;"we were four years old. Right. It's always fun to see him because as you know I've"
04:05;04:10;"felt a little bit exiled out here on the west coast. Right. I've been missing the east coast."
04:10;04:13;"I still haven't gotten enough east coast time. But so it's always fun seeing him"
04:13;04:17;"always reminiscent about certain things. And one thing that we started talking"
04:17;04:22;"about which I wasn't even sure if this was the case anymore. Sometimes things"
04:22;04:27;"about childhood seem like weird fever dreams. I couldn't remember if this used"
04:27;04:30;"to be the case was still the case. Whatever. It just seems so funny to me"
04:30;04:35;"having not lived in New Jersey for a long time. But we started talking about"
04:35;04:38;"the fact that in New Jersey you can't pump your own gas. It's like Oregon. And"
04:38;04:41;"Oregon. I think they might be the only two. I think you're right. And even"
04:41;04:45;"Oregon loosened up a little bit. Did they? I started researching because in Oregon"
04:45;04:49;"it's a much bigger state than New Jersey and there's much larger rural stretches."
04:49;04:53;"New Jersey is such a dense state. You're never that far from wherever. But in"
04:53;04:56;"Oregon sometimes people maybe are like driving in a really rural area"
04:56;05:00;"throughout the night and they're like totally **** because the gas station is"
05:00;05:03;"closed. So they loosened up in certain rural areas that you can pump your own"
05:03;05:08;"gas at night. In very rural areas they'll leave the pump on all night so you"
05:08;05:10;"could play with a credit card on your own. Yeah you could do it that way. Right."
05:10;05:13;"I guess for people who don't I mean I don't even drive that much so I guess"
05:13;05:17;"it's not even that much a part of my life. But it's funny like in New Jersey"
05:17;05:21;"it's not that every gas station has attendants. You get in trouble if you try"
05:21;05:24;"to pump your own gas. And then Wes was telling me you know growing up in"
05:24;05:27;"New Jersey of course he's aware that you you're supposed to pull in but you know"
05:27;05:29;"he hadn't been there in a long time. He'd been living in New York and he told the"
05:29;05:33;"story about going to his parents house and pulling in just out of instinct"
05:33;05:35;"getting out of the car and grabbing the handle. And he said like the guy came over"
05:35;05:41;"and like whoa whoa what the ****. I was like oh dude I'm sorry like I forgot."
05:41;05:45;"And he's like what I come to your job just like like really indignant. Wow. I"
05:45;05:49;"was trying to think like I forgot that this is such an unusual thing. This is"
05:49;05:53;"not true in most states. Right. And I guess the whole history of it and then I"
05:53;05:57;"was like is this because the gas attendance lobby is so strong. It's a"
05:57;06:00;"jobs program. It's weird that apparently there's some serious political"
06:00;06:05;"opposition to it. There have been New Jersey state senators who have really"
06:05;06:08;"fought to stop this. It's a bit of a tradition. It all kind of goes back to"
06:08;06:12;"some time when most gas stations used to have attendants in the early days. Sure."
06:12;06:15;"Back when gas was considered and maybe for whatever reason it was more"
06:15;06:20;"dangerous. Oh is that the reason? They wanted professionals doing it. Oh. I think"
06:20;06:24;"at this point the idea that your average Joe who has a driver's license can't"
06:24;06:28;"pump their own gas for is kind of silly to be scared about that. Right. Back in the"
06:28;06:32;"day most places had were attended. It was this new phenomenon. And they'd like put"
06:32;06:35;"air in your tires if you needed to. Yeah. Full service. Yeah. They probably wear like a"
06:35;06:40;"little hat. Then some guy got it in his head a disruptor whenever this was say"
06:40;06:43;"a hundred years ago. There's a disruptor in New Jersey who said you know what"
06:43;06:47;"everybody come to my gas station pump your own gas. Cheaper. And it's cheaper."
06:47;06:50;"And of course people start flocking to this guy. And then all the other gas"
06:50;06:53;"station owners were like we can't let this guy keep growing at this rate so"
06:53;06:56;"like let's make his strategy illegal. And then they pass laws and it's kind of"
06:56;07:00;"whatever. It's been that way ever since. But I guess it still is this like real"
07:00;07:04;"like hot potato in Jersey. It's just like this insane debate. And I just love that"
07:04;07:09;"nobody's like every other state. Yeah. There's 48 other states. And people are not"
07:09;07:13;"dying en masse. Also it's funny to think about if you lived in Jersey like near"
07:13;07:17;"the border it's a small state. So if you just live across the border from like"
07:17;07:20;"Pennsylvania or something or New York. You really need some gas. You just dip"
07:20;07:23;"over to Pennsylvania. You live like four miles from the border. It's just like it's weird."
07:23;07:27;"It's very weird. I lived in Oregon for years. It would be awkward sometimes. You'd"
07:27;07:31;"be like late to work. And you're like I gotta pull in I gotta get some gas. And"
07:31;07:36;"it's like rush hour and they're like slammed. And you're just sitting there. And you don't"
07:36;07:40;"want to be like hey could I get some service here. It's like when you go into a"
07:40;07:42;"restaurant and you're like getting all like impatient with the waiter. It's not a"
07:42;07:46;"good vibe. I wonder if there's like libertarians in New Jersey and Oregon."
07:46;07:50;"And that's like the worst part of their week. Pulling up to the gas station be"
07:50;07:55;"like this is socialism. I could be pumping my own gas. I'm a free man. I got"
07:55;08:00;"to wait for this lazy protected prick to come pump my gas. Now they want to pay"
08:00;08:05;"these kids $15 an hour. Can you buy gas in bulk? Like a lot of canisters of gas"
08:05;08:09;"keep in your garage and have like a lifetime supply of gas. Oh that is legal."
08:09;08:15;"Is it? I'm sure. There you go. That's like a Lonnie's dad situation. For people who don't"
08:15;08:20;"remember what episode of Time Crisis is Lonnie's dad? '54. Really? I don't know."
08:20;08:28;"Lonnie's dad is installing underground tanks. He's spending $94,000 to install"
08:28;08:35;"underground gas tanks. Lonnie's dad is the dad of Jake's childhood friend Lonnie who would hoard"
08:35;08:40;"McRibs during McRib season and then freeze them. They're scarce. For the lean"
08:40;08:47;"months. Winter's coming. When winter would come Lonnie's dad could not go without his"
08:47;08:50;"McRibs so he would buy McRibs on bulk and freeze them so that he could continue to"
08:50;08:54;"eat them. There was a chest freezer in the basement. But anyway you can imagine"
08:54;09:00;"Lonnie's dad just being like I'm so sick of being told by my government that I"
09:00;09:03;"can't pump my own gas. You know what? F*** this. Yeah and just like having like a huge"
09:03;09:09;"very dangerous garage full of gas just so you don't have to go let the guys"
09:09;09:11;"pump it."

10:23;10:25;"- Should we talk about this John Mayer troll?"
10:25;10:26;"- Oh my God."
10:26;10:27;"- People may or may not know"
10:27;10:30;"there's a Time Crisis text thread."
10:30;10:33;"It's a great place for us to share ideas,"
10:33;10:36;"compile content for upcoming episodes."
10:36;10:37;"- Yup."
10:37;10:41;"- And Seinfeld, you who manage our social media"
10:41;10:45;"and our emails, sent us an email very excitedly"
10:45;10:47;"that you thought could be from John Mayer."
10:47;10:48;"- I was stoked."
10:48;10:50;"I got this email at eight minute,"
10:50;10:53;"that's numeral eight minute Cape Cod"
10:53;10:56;"from someone purporting to be John Mayer."
10:56;10:59;"And while I don't know John Mayer that well,"
10:59;11:00;"it felt like his voice to me."
11:00;11:02;"And it was early."
11:02;11:04;"My faculties maybe were not all there."
11:04;11:06;"And I sent an excited, earnest screenshot"
11:06;11:08;"to the gang, to the crew, being like,"
11:08;11:12;"""Hey, look, we got John Mayer in the inbox here."""
11:12;11:12;"(laughing)"
11:12;11:14;"- The one thing that I'll say,"
11:14;11:15;"when I saw you email this,"
11:15;11:17;"my gut instinct was like,"
11:17;11:19;"I think of you as a very--"
11:19;11:20;"- Savvy."
11:20;11:21;"- Savvy."
11:21;11:22;"- Well, thanks."
11:22;11:22;"- Hard-nosed."
11:22;11:23;"- Yeah."
11:23;11:24;"- What does it mean to be hard-nosed?"
11:24;11:26;"- What, a little bit stubborn?"
11:26;11:26;"- Tough? - Determined."
11:26;11:27;"- Determined, okay."
11:27;11:29;"- Okay, no, that's not what I mean."
11:29;11:31;"You're like a savvy, street smart."
11:31;11:32;"- Right."
11:32;11:32;"- No bull (beep)"
11:32;11:33;"- Skeptical even."
11:33;11:35;"- Skeptical kinda guy."
11:35;11:38;"- Well, look, you know, I call it like it is."
11:38;11:40;"You're right, I did grow up in the streets."
11:40;11:44;"And I'm usually able to detect bull (beep)"
11:44;11:48;"and you know, my one blind spot, if I have any,"
11:48;11:50;"is that I want to believe sometimes"
11:50;11:55;"and sometimes that desire will overshadow reality."
11:55;11:56;"And I think that's what happened here."
11:56;11:57;"- I think I see where Ezra was going though,"
11:57;11:59;"because I had the same feeling."
11:59;12:00;"I thought immediately it was BS,"
12:00;12:02;"but I was like, well, Seinfeld's vouching"
12:02;12:04;"and I trust his judgment."
12:04;12:06;"He clearly vetted this."
12:06;12:07;"And so this is God,"
12:07;12:09;"there's something that I'm not seeing"
12:09;12:10;"'cause I'm an idiot with the internet."
12:10;12:11;"- Fair point."
12:11;12:12;"- Okay, and then the one thing"
12:12;12:14;"that I'll say that goes in your favor, Seinfeld,"
12:14;12:16;"is that you told us that we got an email"
12:16;12:19;"from somebody who is kind of known to be a troll."
12:19;12:21;"- Who's legitimately funny on Instagram."
12:21;12:23;"- He likes to (beep) around on the internet,"
12:23;12:25;"like he knows Brandon Wardell."
12:25;12:28;"- Might I add also that he does follow Seinfeld2000"
12:28;12:31;"on Instagram and will occasionally like a thing."
12:31;12:32;"- Right."
12:32;12:33;"- So I'm like, he's in our orbit."
12:33;12:36;"- So that part was something to consider."
12:36;12:38;"This is a dude who probably sits all day long"
12:38;12:41;"on his phone, tapping away."
12:41;12:42;"- That's all he does."
12:42;12:43;"- Looking at memes."
12:43;12:45;"- Just, yeah, that's right."
12:45;12:46;"- He's a meme boy."

13:39;13:43;"from John Mayer to 8minutecapecott@gmail.com."
13:43;13:46;"Subject line, you really hurt me."
13:46;13:47;"- I mean, I'm hooked, right?"
13:47;13:48;"You get that subject line."
13:48;13:49;"- That is a great start."
13:49;13:50;"- Yeah."
13:50;13:53;"- Hey dudes, I've gone on a total binge of your show."
13:53;13:55;"While listening to episode after episode,"
13:55;13:57;"I learned that you don't think I'm good with dead and co."
13:57;13:59;"So I'll work on improving my technique, I guess."
13:59;14:01;"How's my lyricism though, Jake?"
14:01;14:03;"Also, friends are better than signed felt."
14:03;14:05;"Best, John."
14:05;14:08;"- I feel like that's fairly well constructed."
14:08;14:10;"It's not like, I don't know, it's just--"
14:10;14:12;"- It's definitely not impossible."
14:12;14:14;"And you know what's also funny is that"
14:14;14:16;"if anybody really listens to the show,"
14:16;14:19;"knows that Jake, you've grown,"
14:19;14:22;"or you believe that John Mayer has grown as a Jerry fell in,"
14:22;14:23;"and you gave him props."
14:23;14:25;"- I've grown, John's grown."
14:25;14:26;"- Yeah, so--"
14:26;14:27;"- The whole community's grown."
14:27;14:29;"- So the truth is also, you could imagine"
14:29;14:31;"if somebody started Time Crisis from the beginning,"
14:31;14:32;"and it's very time consuming"
14:32;14:35;"to listen to all 150 hours of content."
14:35;14:36;"- Here we are again."
14:37;14:39;"- You could imagine somebody listening"
14:39;14:41;"and being like, wow, Jake doesn't like John Mayer,"
14:41;14:42;"and then they don't know."
14:42;14:44;"Spoiler alert, he grows on him."
14:44;14:46;"- The Dodger Stadium show was terrific."
14:46;14:48;"(laughing)"
14:48;14:51;"- Can I also add that this came from an AOL account?"
14:51;14:53;"- I know, but why did that make you believe it more?"
14:53;14:55;"- It's a detail."
14:55;14:55;"- 'Cause it's old?"
14:55;14:57;"- It's old, right?"
14:57;14:58;"If there's some history there."
14:58;14:59;"I feel like if you're gonna troll somebody,"
14:59;15:01;"you could just set up a Gmail like that."
15:01;15:02;"This person--"
15:02;15:06;"- Back in the day, one thing that I noticed early on"
15:06;15:08;"when I first entered showbiz,"
15:08;15:13;"I went from hanging out with the college kids and whoever"
15:13;15:15;"to the upper echelons of American society,"
15:15;15:18;"I noticed that celebrities tended to have"
15:18;15:21;"Mac.com email addresses."
15:21;15:22;"Oh, this is 10 years ago."
15:22;15:23;"- What's the theory on that?"
15:23;15:24;"- I don't even remember."
15:24;15:28;"Maybe back then a Mac.com seemed like a cut above."
15:28;15:29;"- Is that Apple?"
15:29;15:30;"Like Mac?"
15:30;15:31;"Macintosh?"
15:31;15:34;"- I guess it was like the built-in email app"
15:34;15:35;"that would come with a Mac,"
15:35;15:37;"and so maybe when you get a new Mac,"
15:37;15:39;"it says, ""Set up your Mac.com,"""
15:39;15:40;"and then suddenly you're locked in."
15:40;15:41;"I don't know."
15:41;15:43;"- Well, I mean, I think there even was a moment"
15:43;15:46;"when being really into Apple products"
15:46;15:49;"was this kind of specific thing."
15:49;15:52;"Maybe almost like before the iPhone dropped."
15:52;15:54;"- Sort of like Justin Long."
15:54;15:54;"- Yeah."
15:54;15:55;"- I'm a Mac."
15:55;15:58;"- The iPhone really won a lot of people over to Apple,"
15:58;16:00;"and before that, it was a little bit of like--"
16:00;16:01;"- A little more niche."
16:01;16:02;"- It was a little more niche."
16:02;16:06;"- The Mac.com was apparently the precursor to iCloud,"
16:06;16:08;"and you had to pay yearly for it."
16:08;16:09;"- Oh, so there you go."
16:09;16:10;"You had to pay."
16:10;16:12;"So, you know, Johnny Sixpack,"
16:12;16:14;"he's not gonna be shelling out for a fancy Mac.com,"
16:14;16:16;"but John Mayer, maybe."
16:16;16:17;"- Joe the Plumber."
16:17;16:18;"- Joe the Plumber, he's not--"
16:18;16:18;"- He's not shelling out."
16:19;16:20;"- Remember Joe the Plumber?"
16:20;16:21;"- Oh, God."
16:21;16:22;"(laughing)"
16:22;16:24;"- Such a weak vibe."
16:24;16:26;"(laughing)"
16:26;16:27;"- Didn't he run for office at one point?"
16:27;16:29;"- (beep) you, Joe the Plumber."
16:29;16:31;"- Joe did vote for Hillary, though."
16:31;16:32;"- Oh, really?"
16:32;16:33;"- I'm not making that up."
16:33;16:34;"- I'm sure he did."
16:34;16:36;"- It was like Joe the Plumber, Obama girl."
16:36;16:37;"- Oh, wow."
16:37;16:38;"- Anyway."
16:38;16:39;"- Okay, you know what?"
16:39;16:41;"I also wanna go through what was said on the text thread."
16:41;16:43;"- Okay."
16:43;16:45;"- Seinfeld sends a screenshot, ""Oh my God, you guys,"""
16:45;16:48;"and then he sends the ""You really hurt me"" email"
16:48;16:51;"from John Mayer, and wrote, ""I wonder if it's legit."""
16:51;16:54;"- Okay, so there was a bit of skepticism already."
16:54;16:56;"- I wrote back first, ""LOL, no way."""
16:56;16:58;"(laughing)"
17:00;17:02;"- ""What's the email address?"""
17:02;17:04;"Then Nick writes back, he saw it,"
17:04;17:05;"(beep)"
17:05;17:09;"at AOL.com, and I wrote, ""Hmm, doubtful."""
17:09;17:11;"Then Nick wrote, ""The AOL almost feels legit."""
17:11;17:12;"- Yeah."
17:12;17:13;"- ""I'm gonna check too."""
17:13;17:14;"- I agree."
17:14;17:15;"- And then Seinfeld said, ""I agree."
17:15;17:17;"""Seems kinda like his sense of humor."""
17:17;17:18;"- Could be an ironic AOL."
17:18;17:20;"Thank you, I'm glad we're resurfacing this."
17:20;17:22;"- Matt says, ""It seems bizarre that he would email,"
17:22;17:25;"""but it would be so weird that someone would do that, haha."""
17:25;17:27;"Then Jake wrote, ""This is insane, I hope it's real."
17:27;17:29;"""It seems like his humor, like Jason said."
17:29;17:30;"""How do we verify?"""
17:30;17:32;"So you were kinda, you were getting swept up"
17:32;17:34;"in the John Mayer fever."
17:34;17:35;"- Oh, absolutely."
17:35;17:36;"- 'Cause you wanna believe, right?"
17:36;17:37;"- Right."
17:37;17:38;"- You want it to be true."
17:38;17:39;"- How do we verify?"
17:39;17:40;"But then I think Matt--"
17:40;17:41;"- X-Files 2000."
17:41;17:42;"- I think--"
17:42;17:43;"- I wanna believe."
17:43;17:46;"- I think Matt, who's one of the producers in the show,"
17:46;17:49;"oh no, this is later, I'm sorry, I'm jumping ahead."
17:49;17:51;"I'm jumping ahead to the elevator selfie."
17:51;17:54;"- Oh, wow, yeah, I forgot about that."
17:54;17:56;"- 'Cause you wrote him back to say, ""Please verify,"""
17:56;18:00;"and then he sent you a photo of John Mayer in an elevator."
18:00;18:02;"Like he had taken a selfie in a mirror of an elevator."
18:02;18:03;"- Yeah."
18:03;18:05;"- And then Matt wrote, ""I just Google image searched"
18:05;18:07;"""John Mayer elevator selfie."""
18:07;18:08;"It was the first thing that popped up."
18:08;18:10;"And I was like, ""Come on, Seinfeld!"""
18:10;18:13;"- Well, again, this whole thing was characterized"
18:13;18:15;"by my just wanting it to be so true."
18:15;18:18;"- It's a new side I'm seeing of you."
18:18;18:19;"- Well, you know, I have my,"
18:19;18:20;"it's like frosted mini-wheats, you know?"
18:20;18:24;"There's like the earnest side, and then there's the frosted."
18:24;18:25;"- I mean, I don't, I like it."
18:25;18:27;"It's a softer side."
18:27;18:29;"- It's the more Canadian side."
18:29;18:31;"- Yeah, I guess so."
18:31;18:32;"- Well, you're a Canadian guy."
18:32;18:35;"You grew up in the comfort of a loving society"
18:35;18:37;"with a little bit more of a social safety net."
18:37;18:38;"- True."
18:38;18:41;"- And whatever you might have wanted to believe"
18:41;18:44;"back there in Montreal/Toronto"
18:44;18:45;"about how people treat each other,"
18:45;18:49;"about how Tim Hortons functions, whatever,"
18:49;18:52;"by the time you came to LA, it was ""Welcome to the Jungle."""
18:52;18:55;"- It's true, and I'm still acclimatizing."
18:55;18:57;"And, you know, I have to say, too,"
18:57;19:00;"that inbox is full of beautiful letters"
19:00;19:02;"from fans all over the world"
19:02;19:04;"who are writing from their heart,"
19:04;19:07;"and it's very rare to get this kind of"
19:07;19:08;"troll wave kind of thing."
19:08;19:12;"So already, you know, I felt like I'm in a safe space here."
19:12;19:13;"I'm in a no-lie zone."
19:13;19:14;"- That's a fair point."
19:14;19:16;"That's a really fair point."
19:16;19:19;"- I could also imagine, too, that Seinfeld,"
19:19;19:21;"and we've talked about this before,"
19:21;19:24;"running a meme account, lest we forget"
19:24;19:28;"that Seinfeld 2000 comes from such a kind of dark place"
19:28;19:29;"that it's not just a meme account"
19:29;19:31;"having fun with the show Seinfeld."
19:31;19:35;"It started out to mercilessly mock"
19:35;19:37;"another Seinfeld account."
19:37;19:38;"- That's correct."
19:38;19:39;"- Oh, that's the backstory?"
19:39;19:40;"- Oh, yeah. - We never talked about this?"
19:40;19:41;"- No, I don't know this."
19:41;19:42;"- Oh, my God."
19:42;19:44;"- I'll tell my version, you tell me if I'm being fair."
19:44;19:45;"- Sure."
19:45;19:48;"- There was a few guys who I think were comedy,"
19:48;19:50;"LA kind of comedy writers,"
19:50;19:51;"maybe like sitcom writer type dudes."
19:51;19:53;"- They worked at BuzzFeed at the time."
19:53;19:54;"- They worked at BuzzFeed."
19:54;19:58;"This was a very simple Twitter."
19:58;20:00;"This is also when Twitter seemed like a pleasant place"
20:00;20:03;"to exchange ideas and try out funny ideas."
20:03;20:03;"- Pretty innocuous."
20:03;20:04;"- Pretty innocuous."
20:04;20:07;"So these guys start an account called Modern Seinfeld."
20:07;20:08;"- Right?"
20:08;20:09;"Or Seinfeld Today?"
20:09;20:10;"- I think it was @SeinfeldToday"
20:10;20:13;"and then the Modern Seinfeld was like the nickname."
20:13;20:15;"- Okay, so it's @SeinfeldToday."
20:15;20:17;"And this is based on a very simple premise,"
20:17;20:19;"which is, (laughs)"
20:19;20:20;"I can't even say it without thinking about"
20:20;20:23;"your psychotic mockery."
20:23;20:25;"It was based on a very simple premise,"
20:25;20:27;"which is what would Seinfeld be like"
20:27;20:29;"if it was on TV today?"
20:29;20:32;"I actually love the backstory of this so much"
20:32;20:35;"'cause it's just such a modern internet kind of story."
20:35;20:37;"I always wanna look up some real examples"
20:37;20:39;"of their early tweets."
20:39;20:40;"- I mean, some of them are pretty good."
20:40;20:41;"- Are they?"
20:41;20:44;"- I mean-- - They're realistic."
20:44;20:46;"I mean, they're fine. - Call me crazy,"
20:46;20:47;"but I feel like that's a big thread"
20:47;20:50;"in the Seinfeld 2000 account."
20:50;20:51;"- Oh, for sure, yeah."
20:51;20:54;"- I'm failing to understand the distinction here."

21:51;21:53;"where the Seinfeld's origin story."
21:53;21:55;"Maybe this episode is gonna be called"
21:55;21:56;"Seinfeld's origin story."
21:56;22:03;"So I'm going back to some random website from 2014."
22:03;22:05;"- Is the account still going?"
22:05;22:06;"- It's not."
22:06;22:09;"And I wanna take some credit for it not going."
22:09;22:12;"- This is the 25 best modern Seinfeld tweets."
22:12;22:13;"Somebody took the time in 2014"
22:13;22:17;"to compile some of their favorite modern Seinfeld tweets."
22:17;22:18;"Here's some examples."
22:18;22:20;"Elaine loves the way her new boyfriend smells,"
22:20;22:22;"but when she discovers he uses Axe body spray,"
22:22;22:25;"she begins to question her entire life."
22:25;22:29;"Okay, I can see if you're a real Seinfeld fan,"
22:29;22:31;"you're like, that's lazy."
22:31;22:33;"No, Jerry and Larry wouldn't write that today."
22:33;22:35;"She begins to question her entire life."
22:35;22:38;"I guess, you know, Elaine does have moments like that."
22:38;22:39;"Here's another one."
22:39;22:41;"Jerry's Twitter's hacked."
22:41;22:43;"People like hacked Jerry better."
22:43;22:46;"George tries to get trampled on Black Friday so he can sue."
22:46;22:48;"Everyone is polite."
22:48;22:49;"Okay, here's one issue that people,"
22:49;22:51;"the critics had with this account."
22:51;22:53;"Often it just wasn't that funny,"
22:53;22:55;"and sometimes they would come up with things"
22:55;22:57;"that could have happened back then."
22:57;22:59;"Like the, you know, people going crazy on Black Friday."
22:59;23:01;"It's, you know, it's probably gotten worse."
23:01;23:03;"That existed in the 90s."
23:03;23:04;"Here's another one."
23:04;23:07;"Kramer fries a turkey in Jerry's apartment."
23:07;23:08;"Jerry, dude in your apartment."
23:08;23:10;"Kramer, nah, Jerry, my apartment's no good."
23:10;23:12;"Too smoky from the dry run."
23:12;23:14;"Yeah, I mean, that's not modern at all."
23:14;23:17;"Was fried turkey like some dumb brief meme in 2013"
23:17;23:18;"or something?"
23:18;23:20;"That probably came out around Thanksgiving."
23:20;23:22;"I'm assuming they wanted to hit that holiday,"
23:22;23:24;"get those holiday retweets."
23:24;23:27;"Okay, so you see this account."
23:27;23:28;"Yeah."
23:28;23:29;"What year are we talking?"
23:29;23:30;"2012, actually."
23:30;23:30;"Okay."
23:30;23:32;"End of 2012, December-ish."
23:32;23:34;"And this account was a phenomenon."
23:34;23:37;"You see, it has 820,000 Twitter followers,"
23:37;23:40;"and I think it accumulated that amount in about a month."
23:40;23:42;"And also, you gotta keep in mind, Jake,"
23:42;23:46;"this is in 2013, 2014, where suddenly people were,"
23:46;23:48;"you know, were starting to hit that 20 plus years"
23:48;23:49;"since the birth of Seinfeld,"
23:49;23:51;"where of course Seinfeld's always been on TV,"
23:51;23:53;"but 2013, I think, was around the time"
23:53;23:54;"people started to be like,"
23:54;23:56;"yeah, but remember Seinfeld?"
23:56;23:57;"Sure."
23:57;23:58;"Oh, wow."
23:58;23:58;"What's up?"
23:58;24:01;"Oh, Jake Longstreth is following this account."
24:01;24:02;"What?"
24:02;24:03;"And you totally forgot about it?"
24:03;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:06;"You just got caught up in the hype."
24:06;24:07;"I don't know."
24:07;24:09;"I mean, if they don't post anymore,"
24:09;24:11;"why would I even know that I follow them?"
24:11;24:12;"Yeah, you probably, I mean,"
24:12;24:13;"they haven't been running for about three years."
24:13;24:14;"I'm a real loose,"
24:14;24:17;"I'm very indiscriminate with who I follow."
24:17;24:17;"You follow me?"
24:17;24:20;"Look, I was following them for a while too."
24:20;24:21;"It was a phenomenon."
24:21;24:23;"It was like everyone was following this."
24:23;24:24;"You know what's also kind of brutal about it?"
24:24;24:25;"Here's another."
24:25;24:28;"Jerry gets stuck on a never-ending group text."
24:28;24:30;"You used to be able to avoid people."
24:30;24:32;"Now they can choose to live in your pocket forever."
24:32;24:33;"Yeah, it's not."
24:33;24:34;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
24:34;24:34;"One issue about it is--"
24:34;24:35;"The ideas aren't terrible."
24:35;24:37;"No, they're not terrible."
24:37;24:38;"Clearly the people who run this account are smart."
24:38;24:40;"I also want to make that clear."
24:40;24:42;"They're smart and there are funny moments"
24:42;24:45;"and I'm sure they're funny with other stuff."
24:45;24:48;"There's something inherently goofy about the premise."
24:48;24:49;"And the truth is,"
24:49;24:52;"I bet if you saw Jerry go do standup today,"
24:52;24:54;"there might be a few groaners."
24:54;24:56;"I'm sure he'd be doing like cell phone humor."
24:56;24:59;"He does Uber jokes now and yeah, he does iPhone stuff."
24:59;25:01;"What strikes me is that the ideas aren't terrible,"
25:01;25:04;"but they're just like the way they're written for Twitter."
25:04;25:08;"It's not like a good match between the ideas and the medium."
25:08;25:10;"They're sort of like explaining a joke"
25:10;25:12;"rather than just like writing a joke."
25:12;25:14;"Yeah, these are kind of log lines."
25:14;25:15;"Or it's sort of like,"
25:15;25:17;"it's like a dry erase board in a writer's room"
25:17;25:18;"and they're just writing down ideas"
25:18;25:19;"and they haven't like figured out how to like--"
25:19;25:21;"And actually, the truth is, also to be fair to them,"
25:21;25:22;"yeah, you're right about the format."
25:22;25:25;"'Cause I bet if you went back to the Seinfeld writer's room"
25:25;25:27;"in like '93 and they were just like,"
25:27;25:29;"you just saw what they wrote."
25:29;25:30;"Yeah, bullet points of--"
25:30;25:32;"Kramer gets a crazy idea"
25:32;25:34;"that he can return bottles in Michigan."
25:34;25:35;"Right."
25:35;25:37;"Jerry thinks that girls' hands look funny."
25:37;25:38;"He kind of like sucks."
25:38;25:39;"Yeah, yeah."
25:39;25:41;"I think a lot of those original ideas came from like,"
25:41;25:44;"real story, like a lot of them were from Larry's life"
25:44;25:46;"or all the writers' lives."
25:46;25:48;"And they had a weird kind of authenticity"
25:48;25:50;"as absurd as they were."
25:50;25:51;"They also were a little more,"
25:51;25:54;"they had that New York Larry and Jerry flavor."
25:54;25:57;"Whereas these people are just trying to do more gloat."
25:57;25:59;"Jerry discovers his girlfriend"
25:59;26:02;"still uses her J-date profile, okay."
26:02;26:05;"Kramer leaves messages for the NSA in his emails."
26:05;26:07;"Newman reluctantly tries SoulCycle."
26:07;26:11;"What is, yeah, what?"
26:11;26:14;"Okay, so let's cycle back."
26:14;26:16;"I wanna hear the origin story of Seinfeld 2000."
26:16;26:18;"You gotta understand, Jake,"
26:18;26:20;"modern Seinfeld, Seinfeld today was popping."
26:20;26:21;"I get it."
26:21;26:22;"And it was getting a lot of positive attention."
26:22;26:23;"I followed them."
26:23;26:24;"Clearly, you followed them."
26:24;26:25;"I don't even remember."
26:25;26:27;"You were just on a following spree,"
26:27;26:28;"you were probably following them."
26:28;26:30;"Ashton Kutcher just laughing your ass off"
26:30;26:32;"on your iPhone 2."
26:32;26:32;"Ashton Kutcher."
26:33;26:35;"I think I joined Twitter in 2013"
26:35;26:37;"and I was like, oh yeah, I'll follow this."
26:37;26:38;"I didn't know."
26:38;26:40;"So anyway, this website was popping."
26:40;26:41;"Yeah, yeah."
26:41;26:43;"And I also, you know, it's always exciting"
26:43;26:45;"to have a memory that you were early on something."
26:45;26:46;"Just like I've talked about on this show,"
26:46;26:49;"I believe that I was one of the first 5,000 people"
26:49;26:50;"to use Facebook."
26:50;26:52;"And I also believe I was one of the first 5,000 people"
26:52;26:54;"to follow Seinfeld 2000."
26:54;26:58;"Yeah, you were an early adopter for sure."
26:58;27:00;"And so when I first saw it,"
27:00;27:01;"at this point it's hard to even remember"
27:01;27:03;"'cause it's memes on memes on memes,"
27:03;27:08;"but early Seinfeld 2000 was this totally unhinged voice"
27:08;27:11;"getting all the characters' names wrong."
27:11;27:14;"Like always writing Jerry and Cram."
27:14;27:16;"You still do, I feel like."
27:16;27:18;"A little bit, but you know."
27:18;27:19;"Jerry with one R."
27:19;27:22;"It's kinda polished, it's kinda congealed into a, yeah."
27:22;27:26;"It kinda gave this impression that it was like"
27:26;27:29;"a psychotic person who had looked at Seinfeld today"
27:29;27:31;"and was either mercilessly mocking it"
27:31;27:34;"or just crazily trying to recreate it."
27:34;27:38;"So his whole thing was almost in this like crude fashion."
27:38;27:41;"Rather than their kind of like, you know,"
27:41;27:43;"slightly middle brow, Newman tries SoulCycle,"
27:43;27:46;"he would just, ""Jerry, get iPad."""
27:46;27:49;"It kinda seemed like just like a nut."
27:49;27:51;"A nut who's obsessed with Seinfeld."
27:51;27:52;"And also he would always write,"
27:52;27:54;"""What if Seinfeld on TV today?"""
27:54;27:56;"Yeah, 'cause I remember reading their bio"
27:56;27:57;"and I think it was like,"
27:57;27:59;"""Oh, what if it was still on the air?"""
27:59;28:01;"And I just remember that phrase."
28:01;28:04;"Like by this point I was so burnt out on their account."
28:04;28:06;"And I just saw that phrase, ""On the air,"""
28:06;28:08;"and it felt so like antiquated."
28:08;28:11;"And I don't know, like people are, you know,"
28:11;28:12;"not just watching TV anymore."
28:12;28:15;"And so opening every tweet with like,"
28:15;28:17;"""What if it was on television still?"""

28:57;28:57;"- Oh, yeah."
28:57;28:59;"I mean, I want to say that is actually"
28:59;29:02;"one of the most accurate descriptions of the account."
29:02;29:04;"I think, I think you're really nailing it."
29:04;29:06;"I mean, I was into it at first"
29:06;29:09;"and then it just started to feel so like smug to me."
29:09;29:14;"And I think the idea of two, you know, media guys"
29:14;29:16;"taking up the mantle of the greatest show on television"
29:16;29:20;"and being like, ""No, we'll just pick up where this left off."""
29:20;29:21;"It just bothered me so much."

29:25;29:28;"that has an article from torontolife.com"
29:28;29:31;"that's talking about Seinfeld 2000."
29:31;29:34;"They talk about your syntax, like imagined."
29:34;29:35;"That was also very, even just the word"
29:35;29:37;"he would always write instead of imagine,"
29:37;29:39;"he would write imagine."
29:39;29:40;"- Yeah."
29:40;29:41;"- I-M-A-G-E-N."
29:41;29:41;"- Yeah, yeah."
29:41;29:43;"- Oh, and also you would often like,"
29:43;29:45;"you'd also get into some of the more uncomfortable parts"
29:45;29:47;"of the Seinfeld universe,"
29:47;29:49;"such as the fact that in real life,"
29:49;29:52;"Michael Richards went on his infamous racist tirade"
29:52;29:53;"- Sure."
29:53;29:54;"- Against some black members of the audience"
29:54;29:58;"at the laugh factory or whatever."
29:58;29:59;"Everybody remembers he went nuts,"
29:59;30:00;"he's saying the N word, horrible."
30:00;30:03;"So you would always write, ""Crime says N word."""
30:03;30:04;"(laughing)"
30:04;30:05;"So you'd always kind of bring in"
30:05;30:08;"that uncomfortable real (beep) into it."
30:08;30:11;"- Yeah, this is a character who doesn't really,"
30:11;30:13;"there's no line of division between the show"
30:13;30:15;"and the actors outside of the show."
30:15;30:16;"It's kind of, it's a lot,"
30:16;30:18;"there's a derangement there happening."
30:18;30:20;"- Has the character evolved or is it?"
30:20;30:22;"- Well, I just want to give you some context"
30:22;30:23;"for his early tweets."
30:23;30:24;"- Okay."
30:24;30:25;"- 'Cause we gave some of the early"
30:25;30:28;"Seinfeld Today tweets from 2013."
30:28;30:31;"These are some of your tweets from 2013."
30:31;30:32;"Again, keep in mind,"
30:32;30:35;"modern Seinfeld is Newman reluctantly tries soul cycle."
30:35;30:36;"And this is Seinfeld 2000."
30:36;30:40;"Jerry gazed wistfully at his own reflection in the mirror."
30:40;30:44;"""Jerry, what's the deal dot dot dot with me?"""
30:44;30:47;"He searched his sad eyes for an answer, but find none."
30:47;30:49;"That's an early one."
30:49;30:50;"And then just like this kind of (beep)"
30:50;30:51;"Picture anything."
30:51;30:54;"Okay, now imagine that thing in a different context."
30:54;30:56;"LOL."
30:56;30:57;"Just that kind of like early, just like,"
30:57;30:59;"everything is bull (beep)"
30:59;31:00;"That's also funny too,"
31:00;31:02;"'cause I think like that was before"
31:02;31:05;"even people who like Twitter hated Twitter."
31:05;31:07;"So it was just like this kind of just like very early"
31:07;31:10;"to be like, all this (beep) is stupid."
31:10;31:14;"Oh, you would always call Obama, Barry O-bam."
31:14;31:14;"- Barry Obama."
31:14;31:16;"Yeah, there was like this weird, like,"
31:16;31:17;"and it's not that funny anymore,"
31:17;31:20;"but at the time there was kind of this like"
31:20;31:23;"far right undercurrent to it all as well,"
31:23;31:25;"where this person had this like,"
31:25;31:27;"was bringing in all this other stuff into it,"
31:27;31:30;"and had a distant distrust of the president."
31:30;31:32;"- Barry O-bam built Festivus Mosque near ground zero."
31:32;31:33;"- Right."
31:33;31:34;"- Oh my God."
31:34;31:37;"- You know, the Obama Festivus Mosque."
31:37;31:38;"That thing is..."
31:38;31:41;"- Okay, so that's the early Seinfeld 2000."
31:41;31:43;"Yeah, and then I think as time went on,"
31:43;31:45;"the Seinfeld 2000 account,"
31:45;31:47;"yeah, moved past the unhinged bitterness."
31:47;31:49;"And then you just started doing legitimately funny stuff,"
31:49;31:52;"such as putting the Curb Your Enthusiasm music"
31:52;31:56;"on real life footage and doing a slow zoom."
31:56;31:58;"- Well, at a certain point it became,"
31:58;32:02;"how can I take this insane, very difficult"
32:02;32:04;"to sort of parse, high barrier to entry thing,"
32:04;32:08;"and like, how far can I kind of sell it out, I guess?"
32:08;32:11;"Like, how popular can I make this, really,"
32:11;32:15;"with the sort of messed up tools that I've at my disposal,"
32:15;32:17;"if that makes sense?"
32:17;32:17;"You know, how..."
32:17;32:18;"- How fast did it grow?"
32:18;32:20;"- How beautiful a painting could I paint"
32:20;32:23;"with this broken paintbrush that I..."
32:23;32:25;"To use an analogy."
32:25;32:27;"- Oh, I'm following from the art world."
32:27;32:27;"- Thank you, thank you."
32:27;32:28;"- I only..."
32:28;32:30;"- A sophisticated art world."
32:30;32:32;"- I only use the finest materials, okay?"
32:32;32:33;"I don't use broken..."
32:33;32:34;"- I know, I know."
32:34;32:36;"- And then you started branching out to doing like..."
32:36;32:38;"- You're like the Van Gogh of, no."
32:38;32:40;"You just started branching out."
32:40;32:42;"- Well, one of our earliest collaborations"
32:42;32:44;"was Seinfeld Hit Me Up,"
32:44;32:48;"asking if I would do the music for his junior video game."
32:48;32:49;"- Wow."
32:49;32:49;"- Yeah, that was a trip."
32:49;32:51;"- And I just recorded myself, I think, on an iPhone,"
32:51;32:55;"going, ""Bum, ba-dum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da."""
32:55;32:57;"You know, in some ways, I wonder..."
32:57;32:59;"I just read an article this morning"
32:59;33:04;"about kind of like toxic fan culture."
33:04;33:06;"They were talking, and especially with pop stars."
33:06;33:10;"This was specifically about gay male fandoms"
33:10;33:12;"and their misogyny, the occasional misogyny,"
33:12;33:15;"towards female pop stars,"
33:15;33:19;"which is a battle, whatever, that I recuse myself from."
33:19;33:20;"I have no opinion on it,"
33:20;33:23;"but the person writing this article was saying that,"
33:23;33:27;"famously, a lot of female pop stars have large gay audiences,"
33:27;33:30;"but sometimes the interaction that at first seems like"
33:30;33:31;"a mutual support system,"
33:31;33:34;"especially for people who could use it"
33:34;33:35;"because they're oppressed by things in society,"
33:35;33:38;"can sometimes turn toxic into a kind of thing"
33:38;33:39;"where people make themselves feel better"
33:39;33:43;"by constantly calling, you know, say,"
33:43;33:45;"Selena Gomez fat or something."
33:45;33:47;"-Oh, yeah. -The thing that caught my attention,"
33:47;33:48;"'cause I've always liked her music,"
33:48;33:51;"was that they were talking about a pop star, Marina,"
33:51;33:54;"who had this group, Marina and the Diamonds."
33:54;33:56;"And I remember she kind of came out around the same time"
33:56;33:58;"as Vampire Weekend. She's from the UK."
33:58;34:01;"They quoted her as she had like this kind of moment"
34:01;34:03;"with a fan where she said the fan basically"
34:03;34:05;"was just like saying something kind of mean to her."
34:05;34:07;"And she said, ""You know what? I don't find that funny."""
34:07;34:09;"And the person's like, ""Oh, my God."
34:09;34:11;"I'm obsessed with you. This is just a joke."""
34:11;34:12;"She's like, ""Yeah, well, I don't find it funny."""
34:12;34:13;"-Was this in person or on the Internet?"
34:13;34:15;"-This was on Twitter."
34:15;34:17;"She's like, ""I don't find that [bleep] funny."
34:17;34:19;"Every time I get a little message like this,"
34:19;34:21;"it hurts my feelings. I struggle with depression."
34:21;34:23;"I'm a regular person. -Yeah."
34:23;34:24;"-It's just not funny to me."""
34:24;34:28;"And there is this funny way that I feel like --"
34:28;34:30;"I'll make the case that Seinfeld 2000"
34:30;34:33;"kind of saw some of this coming."
34:33;34:36;"And the fact that the fandom is for, like, Seinfeld"
34:36;34:37;"and it was like kind of so obsessive"
34:37;34:39;"and always right on the border of, like,"
34:39;34:41;"""Does this person like Seinfeld or hate it?"""
34:41;34:43;"Like, for instance, the constant reference"
34:43;34:46;"to Crame saying the N-word, constantly reminding people,"
34:46;34:49;"like, ""This dude did something really [bleep] up."""
34:49;34:51;"And, like, the energy of the account"
34:51;34:55;"almost seemed like a premonition of toxic fandom."
34:55;34:57;"But anyway, then I think you kind of got into just --"
34:57;34:59;"you kind of just found your own voice,"
34:59;35:02;"and you didn't need to know what modern Seinfeld was"

39:30;39:32;"comic book guy? -Yes, I'm familiar with him."
39:32;39:35;"-I don't know. For some reason, it's not that hostile,"
39:35;39:37;"but it bothers me so much where you, like --"
39:37;39:39;"I'll, like, do a joke that I think is kind of clever,"
39:39;39:42;"and someone will be like, ""You should have phrased it like this."""
39:42;39:44;"And it's like, ""Why do you care? Like, leave me alone."""
39:44;39:45;"You know? -Right."
39:45;39:48;"-Like, ""Oh, let me just go back and, you know,"
39:48;39:51;"delete it and reword it for you because you --"
39:51;39:52;"I don't know why it irritates me so much,"
39:52;39:55;"but it's just like, sit back and enjoy the free content."""
39:55;39:57;"-I had a thought. -And shut up."
39:57;39:59;"-You know, I try to be positive on this show"
39:59;40:01;"'cause deep down, I do think talking [bleep]"
40:01;40:03;"about some art, whether it's a mainstream whatever"
40:03;40:06;"or something small, it doesn't serve that much purpose."
40:06;40:09;"But I was watching -- I'm not gonna say which one,"
40:09;40:13;"but I was watching a comic book movie on my flight back from UK"
40:13;40:15;"where we played a festival the other week,"
40:15;40:17;"and there was something about the tone"
40:17;40:19;"of this comic book movie, and maybe it's a lot of them."
40:19;40:21;"I've seen stuff in MCU that I love."
40:21;40:23;"I've seen stuff I don't like as much."
40:23;40:25;"And I grew up loving comic books, by the way,"
40:25;40:27;"and specifically Marvel comic books."
40:27;40:29;"A lot of my favorite movies are comic book movies,"
40:29;40:31;"but there's something about the tone."
40:31;40:33;"It almost seems like some of these movies"
40:33;40:37;"now are made for that guy or that person,"
40:37;40:39;"where part of me is kind of like --"
40:39;40:41;"I like to see ""Seinfeld 2000"" say, ""Go [bleep] yourself,"""
40:41;40:45;"because [bleep] that caters too much to the fans"
40:45;40:46;"is not what I want as a fan."
40:46;40:48;"You know, it's like a bit of a paradox."
40:48;40:50;"So in some of these movies where everything"
40:50;40:53;"is this groaner inside joke,"
40:53;40:56;"and maybe certain fans were starved for a long time."
40:56;40:57;"-See, I always think of them as serving"
40:57;40:59;"the lowest common denominator,"
40:59;41:02;"just like bland, corporate, global audience."
41:02;41:04;"-No, but you know what's funny is that --"
41:04;41:06;"-You don't have to know. -No, they have more flavor --"
41:06;41:07;"-That's why I hate all those movies."
41:07;41:10;"-They have more flavor than some of the really bland,"
41:10;41:12;"like, '90s action movies,"
41:12;41:13;"and there's more inside jokes and stuff,"
41:13;41:14;"but it's like when I was watching ""Infinity War"""
41:14;41:17;"on the plane, and I like a lot of elements of it,"
41:17;41:18;"and I like Thor the most,"
41:18;41:22;"because he's the character that has a sense of humor."
41:22;41:25;"Thor represents the absurdity of it all."
41:25;41:27;"-Uh-huh. Self-aware."
41:27;41:29;"-Well, he's not self-aware, but the fact that his --"
41:29;41:31;"-The movie is. -The fact that his movies"
41:31;41:33;"tend to be his movies."
41:33;41:37;"But Thor, the Norse god of thunder."

43:06;43:07;"-I realize that talking about the MCU,"
43:07;43:09;"this is a very hot-button topic,"
43:09;43:11;"and I probably should have put more thought --"
43:11;43:12;"-Is it? Am I gonna get in trouble for --"
43:12;43:13;"-Hot button? -Yeah."
43:13;43:16;"-Because, I mean -- -This is just me as a fan talking."
43:16;43:20;"Just in the movies, I like Thor because --"
43:20;43:23;"'Cause Thor is a big doofus,"
43:23;43:26;"and all the jokes about Thor and related to Thor"
43:26;43:30;"are about that he thinks he's this big, strong guy,"
43:30;43:32;"but he's often being, like, foiled by it."
43:32;43:36;"So there's something about the humor surrounding Thor"
43:36;43:39;"that lets a little bit of air out of the comic book thing,"
43:39;43:40;"but in a way that I like,"
43:40;43:43;"whereas some of the other characters, like Iron Man,"
43:43;43:45;"they think they're being self-aware,"
43:45;43:48;"but it's in this, like, just really played-out, boring way."
43:48;43:54;"So, like, Thor will get into almost, like, classically funny,"
43:54;43:56;"like, slapstick situations --"
43:56;43:58;"a big, strong guy and somebody, like, slips on a banana peel."
43:58;44:00;"That doesn't literally happen."
44:00;44:00;"But there's, like, something funny"
44:00;44:02;"about the way they undercut him,"
44:02;44:05;"whereas Iron Man, it's almost like if you took ""Die Hard"""
44:05;44:07;"and, you know, when you first see ""Die Hard"" as a kid"
44:07;44:09;"and you're like, ""Holy [bleep]"
44:09;44:11;"It's action, but it's funny,"""
44:11;44:13;"and he's saying, ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother[bleep],"""
44:13;44:14;"and he's got all these good lines,"
44:14;44:16;"it's almost like, ""Oh, you like that?"
44:16;44:17;"Let's crank it up to 1,000."""
44:17;44:19;"And then you're like, ""God, please stop."""
44:19;44:21;"Just, like, every time Iron Man falls, it's like,"
44:21;44:24;"""Um, okay, we're gonna have to have a talk about that."
44:24;44:25;"Hey, can you call my insurance company?"""
44:25;44:27;"It's like, it never ends."
44:27;44:30;"There's always these jokes in it that are about the characters,"
44:30;44:33;"these, like, funny references to something that's just, like --"
44:33;44:35;"You could almost do that ""Seinfeld 2000,"""
44:35;44:37;"just, like, literally people running together, like,"
44:37;44:39;"""Hey, it's the guy from 'Captain America.'"""
44:39;44:41;"""Well, you're the guy from 'Black Panther.'"""
44:41;44:43;"""Yeah, and you don't know this part about 'Black Panther'"
44:43;44:44;"'cause you didn't see it."""
44:44;44:46;"It's like the jokes are almost like that."
44:46;44:48;"So it's almost like if you took the concept"
44:48;44:50;"of giving the fans what they want,"
44:50;44:52;"it's almost like, ""Be careful what you wish for."""
44:52;44:53;"That's what I feel like."
44:53;44:54;"-Yeah, yeah."
44:54;44:56;"-Am I gonna get in trouble for this?"
44:56;44:59;"-With who? -The MCU."
44:59;45:00;"People really love the MCU."
45:00;45:02;"I love parts of the MCU."
45:02;45:04;"-What do you mean, the MCU?"
45:04;45:06;"-I guess I just have this feeling."
45:06;45:08;"It's truly like, ""Be careful what you wish for."""
45:08;45:11;"-So the issue is that they're pandering?"
45:11;45:12;"-Yes, that's part of it."
45:12;45:13;"-You stumble upon that formula,"
45:13;45:18;"and then you just try to repeat that ad infinitum"
45:18;45:19;"because you know it's gonna make money?"
45:19;45:20;"-That's part of it. -Is that what you're saying?"
45:20;45:22;"See, I can't take any of these movies seriously."
45:22;45:24;"-I'm probably not explaining it well,"
45:24;45:27;"so it's just kind of like maybe just as I get older,"
45:27;45:29;"you know, I just admire, like,"
45:29;45:32;"artists and cinematic universes."
45:32;45:34;"They're just really off on their own trip."
45:34;45:37;"The fans go with them rather than them"
45:37;45:39;"just giving the fans, like, every little thing"
45:39;45:40;"they could ever want. -Right."
45:40;45:42;"-I do think the ""Avengers"" movies,"
45:42;45:43;"or at least ""Infinity War,"""
45:43;45:45;"it's exciting because everybody's coming together,"
45:45;45:47;"and it's the culmination of a big story,"
45:47;45:49;"but it really isn't ""Be careful what you wish for."""
45:49;45:52;"When I imagine me being a kid in the '90s,"
45:52;45:53;"reading Marvel comic books,"
45:53;45:56;"and loving the characters and all this [bleep]"
45:56;45:58;"and wishing that there were better movies"
45:58;45:59;"that I could watch,"
45:59;46:01;"and maybe it's just 'cause I'm an adult now,"
46:01;46:03;"but now I see this [bleep] and I'm just like, ""Ooh."""
46:03;46:06;"-Is there a musical analogy to be drawn?"
46:06;46:07;"I was just thinking -- -Yeah, I definitely can't say that."
46:07;46:09;"-Oh, 'cause I was just thinking -- -I can't talk about that."
46:09;46:12;"-Oh, well, I'll say it 'cause I don't care."
46:12;46:13;"-I was thinking -- -Don't you say it."
46:13;46:16;"-Late period Weezer. -Oh!"
46:16;46:19;"-How Rivers became pathological"
46:19;46:21;"in his need to write a perfect pop song"
46:21;46:25;"and, quote, like, have hits and, like, make songs that were --"
46:25;46:27;"-I would actually -- Okay, that's interesting."
46:27;46:28;"-I'm just saying, like -- -I would almost say"
46:28;46:30;"the counterargument because he straight-up"
46:30;46:32;"alienated people by doing that."
46:32;46:35;"The ""Avengers"" got bigger than ever by kind of pandering"
46:35;46:37;"and giving people every little thing they could possibly want,"
46:37;46:40;"every little funny fan interaction and stuff."
46:40;46:42;"It's kind of like back in the day,"
46:42;46:46;"people would dream about two characters coming together."
46:46;46:49;"And now, if everybody wants it to happen,"
46:49;46:50;"it just will happen."
46:50;46:51;"-You know what this makes me think of, too?"
46:51;46:53;"It's almost like -- Remember in the '90s,"
46:53;46:54;"you'd go see a movie?"
46:54;46:56;"I don't know why this is coming to mind,"
46:56;46:58;"but, like, I remember when I was, like, 8th grade,"
46:58;47:01;"we saw ""Congo,"" Michael Crichton's ""Congo."""
47:01;47:02;"Do you remember that movie? -Sure, sure."
47:02;47:04;"-And I remember we'd go to movies with my friends"
47:04;47:06;"and we'd, like, enjoy it earnestly,"
47:06;47:08;"but there would also be a level where you're kind of"
47:08;47:09;"leaning over to your friend and you'd be like,"
47:09;47:12;"""Oh, wouldn't it be funny if this or, you know,"
47:12;47:14;"uh, what if --"" You know, you're kind of riffing on the joke."
47:14;47:17;"And now it's almost like the two layers have been melded."
47:17;47:19;"So as soon as you're about to turn to your friend,"
47:19;47:21;"Robert Downey Jr. says the joke"
47:21;47:24;"that you're about to, like, say to your bro kind of deal."
47:24;47:25;"-Right. -So you're just sitting there,"
47:25;47:27;"like -- -But isn't that cool, though?"
47:27;47:28;"That they're, like, one step ahead of you?"
47:28;47:30;"-But I guess what I'm saying is be careful what you wish for."
47:30;47:32;"I don't find it cool."
47:32;47:34;"It makes me want to watch the movie less."
47:34;47:35;"But maybe I'm crazy, too."
47:35;47:36;"And also, yeah, I got to --"
47:36;47:38;"Look, I'm very scared of the MCU."
47:38;47:41;"I really just do want to say again to the MCU --"
47:41;47:43;"-Are you talking about the MCU fans or --"
47:43;47:45;"-Well, the fans are part of the you."
47:45;47:46;"It's a universe."
47:46;47:50;"So it's fans, it's the actors, it's the heroes themselves."
47:50;47:52;"I admire a lot of things. -It's a powerful cabal."
47:52;47:54;"-It's a powerful you."
47:54;47:55;"I just know that, you know, this is --"
47:55;47:56;"-Very powerful you."
47:56;47:58;"-This is very treacherous territory,"
47:58;48:01;"stuff we'd normally stay away from on ""Time Crisis."""
48:01;48:02;"We normally just talk about"
48:02;48:03;"the tasteful palate of '70s music."

48:05;48:06;"-Yeah, we should get back to that."
48:06;48:09;"But I guess all I'm saying is I agree with Seinfeld that --"
48:09;48:10;"And maybe it's just getting older --"
48:10;48:13;"that I like boring stuff now."
48:13;48:15;"I long for things that are rough around the edges."

52:12;52:14;"Like, ""Who's the bozo who did this?"""
52:14;52:16;"And then we were suddenly getting, like,"
52:16;52:19;"""Ed Sheeran, like, get your free concert tickets."""
52:19;52:21;"Like, ""Wendy's,"" like, all this stuff."
52:21;52:24;"And I had to, like, unsubscribe one by one."
52:24;52:26;"So, yeah, there was a bit of corruption happening."
52:26;52:28;"And then in the middle of it all, fake John Mayer."
52:28;52:31;"-Can I just say my favorite part about that text thread?"
52:31;52:34;"-Yeah. -Is that Seinfeld says,"
52:34;52:37;"""I basically need some proof. Send me some proof."""
52:37;52:40;"And he gets the e-mail back from John Mayer"
52:40;52:42;"saying, ""Here's a selfie."""
52:42;52:43;"[ Laughs ]"
52:43;52:45;"There was no picture attached."
52:45;52:49;"So he wants to believe so much that he sort of says,"
52:49;52:52;"""You know, I hate to ask, but maybe you forgot the attachment."""
52:52;52:53;"[ Laughs ]"
52:53;52:56;"And so that's when he gets like, ""Oh, sorry."""
52:56;52:58;"-Oh, yeah, I did. -Here's --"
52:58;52:59;"-Oh, I did. -Yeah, I forgot the attachment"
52:59;53:01;"'cause I'm just a regular guy."
53:01;53:02;"I'm a regular guy who makes mistakes."
53:02;53:04;"-He wanted to believe so bad that he even --"
53:04;53:07;"-Yeah, this whole time, I'm walking the line between,"
53:07;53:09;"""Look, I don't want to look like a fool,"
53:09;53:13;"but I also don't want to offend the John Mayer."""
53:13;53:15;"So I'm walking this line here."
53:15;53:17;"I got, you know -- I'm keeping the tone light,"
53:17;53:19;"a little bit skeptical, you know."
53:19;53:22;"-We should also say that we would love to have"
53:22;53:24;"the real John Mayer come on the show."
53:24;53:25;"-Yeah. -Right?"
53:25;53:28;"-That would be vindicating. -I don't think it would be that hard."
53:28;53:29;"-Be fun to talk some dead. -All right."
53:29;53:34;"-Jake can apologize. -I will not apologize."
53:34;53:36;"-Let me keep it real with you, John."
53:36;53:38;"-If there was a tactful way to approach it,"
53:38;53:42;"to be like, ""Hey, listen, I saw you at the Hollywood Bowl"
53:42;53:44;"in '17, then I saw you at Dodger Stadium in '18,"
53:44;53:47;"and I noticed your playing was a lot different in '18,"
53:47;53:49;"and I would say this, a lot more reminiscent of Jerry,"
53:49;53:51;"how conscious of an effort was that?"
53:51;53:54;"Was that in response to fan feedback?"
53:54;53:56;"I mean, I don't know."
53:56;53:58;"I feel like you could bring that up in a way"
53:58;53:59;"that isn't, like, saying you suck."
53:59;54:01;"-It's very diplomatic. -Right."
54:01;54:03;"-Anyhoo. -Let's go for it."
54:03;54:13;"♪♪"
54:43;54:50;"♪♪"

54:55;54:58;"-One thing that you and John Mayer both have in common"
54:58;54:59;"is that you're both from Connecticut,"
54:59;55:00;"and you're both born in 1977."
55:00;55:03;"-We got a CT email. -CT email."
55:03;55:05;"-Right? -We got an email from the CTU."
55:05;55:06;"That's the Connecticut Universe."
55:06;55:09;"Now... -The TCCTU."
55:09;55:10;"-Within the ""Time Crisis"" universe,"
55:10;55:11;"you have smaller universes,"
55:11;55:13;"such as the Connecticut Universe,"
55:13;55:15;"'cause we talk about Connecticut on ""Time Crisis,"""
55:15;55:17;"and that's the TCCTU."
55:17;55:19;"The TCU CTU."
55:19;55:22;"-Let's go to the ""Time Crisis"" mailbag."

56:05;56:08;"that the only musician to ever come out of Connecticut"
56:08;56:09;"is John Mayer."

56:11;56:14;"Mayer's got nothing on some of CT's greats."""
56:14;56:16;"And then he lists a lot of Connecticut stuff."
56:16;56:17;"Well, okay."
56:17;56:20;"Now, first of all, my memory is that"
56:20;56:23;"you were the one, Jake, bashing Connecticut"
56:23;56:26;"because you came from there and you have some self-hatred"
56:26;56:29;"or just, you know, you think it represents the bad old days."
56:29;56:32;"No, it's not that."
56:32;56:34;"My take on Connecticut is that Connecticut"
56:34;56:38;"in the public imagination is misrepresented."
56:38;56:40;"The reputation of the state is that of, like,"
56:40;56:42;"-Greenwich. -Greenwich, Southwest,"
56:42;56:44;"like Greenwich and Stanford,"
56:44;56:46;"which is the southwest corner near New York."
56:46;56:48;"-Preppy. Investment bankers. -Investment bankers."
56:48;56:50;"Precisely that. Real estate guys."
56:50;56:51;"That kind of stuff."
56:51;56:53;"And my argument was basically that, like,"
56:53;56:56;"the state is, like, not dissimilar from New Jersey"
56:56;56:58;"-or Massachusetts. -Mm-hmm."
56:58;57:01;"Or suburban New York outside of the city,"
57:01;57:03;"which is to say a mix of, like, working class,"
57:03;57:06;"rich towns, rural areas."
57:06;57:07;"It's a mishmash."
57:07;57:09;"And so I was just saying that, like,"
57:09;57:12;"Connecticut has, like, the lamest reputation."
57:12;57:15;"-Ah. -Not that it actually is a lame state."
57:15;57:17;"I actually liked growing up there in Southberry."
57:17;57:18;"That's where I'm from."
57:18;57:22;"But its reputation is just really lame"
57:22;57:23;"and easy to bust on."
57:23;57:26;"And Jersey has a great reputation."
57:26;57:28;"-Not in the sense... -Well, Jersey was the most hated state"
57:28;57:29;"-for a long time. -How about this, though?"
57:29;57:32;"It's got a romantic, gritty reputation."
57:32;57:34;"It's got a lot of heavy hitters"
57:34;57:36;"that have come out of there."
57:36;57:38;"It's got great stories about it."
57:38;57:39;"-Right. -We're talking about the songs"
57:39;57:41;"of Bruce Springsteen or The Sopranos."
57:41;57:42;"-Right. -You know."
57:42;57:45;"It's got a lot of, like, gravitas."
57:45;57:46;"-So maybe... -Connecticut has no gravitas."
57:46;57:49;"Maybe you and Andrew are not that far apart."
57:49;57:50;"I don't think we are."
57:50;57:51;"You're just kind of coming at it from different angles."
57:51;57:54;"And look, I don't remember what I said in that episode."
57:54;57:56;"He says, ""I scathingly put Connecticut"
57:56;57:58;"in the bottom five states regarding music."""
57:58;58:00;"Okay. Well, what does he shout out here?"
58:00;58:01;"He shouts out Rivers Cuomo."
58:01;58:03;"I knew that he was from Connecticut."
58:03;58:05;"And he says, ""MGMT met in Middletown."""
58:05;58:06;"-Right. -I knew that."
58:06;58:08;"I'm pretty sure I saw MGMT when I was in college."
58:08;58:10;"-That's tight. -'Cause I went to go visit a buddy"
58:10;58:11;"at Wesleyan."
58:11;58:12;"Oh, did you see him there?"
58:12;58:13;"I think I saw them play."
58:13;58:14;"I'll never know for sure, but I..."
58:14;58:16;"Great band."
58:16;58:18;"And I think we forgot them in our CT discussion."
58:18;58:20;"Yeah, although they just went to college in CT."
58:20;58:23;"-But whatever. -Yeah, but the band formed in CT."
58:23;58:26;"Yeah. No, and there's a lot of cool colleges in CT."
58:26;58:28;"-What is it? -Thurston Moores."
58:28;58:29;"-Thurston Moores. -Bethel."
58:29;58:30;"-Okay. -Okay."
58:30;58:31;"Fair enough."
58:31;58:33;"Jeff Porcaro hails from South Windsor."
58:33;58:34;"This is a stretch."
58:34;58:37;"I didn't know that. I mean, he was an incredible drummer."
58:37;58:39;"-He played on Thriller. -Okay."
58:39;58:40;"Oh, Liz Fair is from New Haven."
58:40;58:41;"I did not know that."
58:41;58:43;"Yeah, I thought of her as being Chicago,"
58:43;58:45;"where I think she started out there."
58:45;58:47;"And, of course, Dirty Projectors."
58:47;58:50;"He says, ""It's a very dirty move of you"
58:50;58:51;"to not even mention your own brother's band"
58:51;58:53;"in a discussion of Connecticut music."""
58:53;58:55;"Well, I think it was -- I was gonna take it for granted."
58:55;58:57;"Or you know Dave so well, the idea of you referring to Dave"
58:57;58:59;"-as a Connecticut musician. -Yeah."
58:59;59:00;"It's a given."
59:00;59:03;"And, Jake, you also mentioned that you couldn't imagine"
59:03;59:04;"moving back to Connecticut now."
59:04;59:06;"Any chance you know of a guy named Keith Richards?"
59:06;59:08;"Ever heard of a guy named Paul Simon?"
59:08;59:10;"Nope, not really."
59:10;59:11;"What about Roger Glover,"
59:11;59:14;"songwriter and bassist of Deep Purple?"
59:14;59:16;"These are all just a few of the distinguished musicians"
59:16;59:18;"that now call CT home."
59:18;59:20;"Although, to be fair, that's the exact CT"
59:20;59:21;"that Jake's talking about."
59:21;59:22;"That's the southwest corner."
59:22;59:24;"These are rich dudes in the southwest corner."
59:24;59:26;"They could have moved to Westchester, Jersey, whatever."
59:26;59:27;"They just found a house they liked in CT."
59:27;59:29;"They all live together?"
59:29;59:30;"Yes."
59:30;59:35;"There's a Baby Boomer rock star gated community"
59:35;59:37;"just outside Stanford."
59:37;59:39;"Well, here's what I gotta say is that, first of all,"
59:39;59:42;"I respect Andrew because I'm very defensive"
59:42;59:43;"of my home state, New Jersey."
59:43;59:45;"Although, you're right, in a funny way,"
59:45;59:47;"over my lifetime, New Jersey's become --"
59:47;59:48;"I don't know if people --"
59:48;59:50;"Do people still make fun in New Jersey?"
59:50;59:51;"I knew growing up --"
59:51;59:52;"Yeah, it's like, ""It stinks."""
59:52;59:54;"Yeah, I remember growing up, there was still, like,"
59:54;59:56;"the jokes, ""New Jersey smells bad,"" whatever."
59:56;59:58;"And then when I first got to Columbia,"
59:58;01:00:01;"I was very taken aback when I would meet kids"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"who weren't even from the city."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"'Cause, you know, kids who grew up in the city --"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"Like, I probably have said this on ""Time Crisis"" before."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"You know, I was born in Manhattan,"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"lived there for a couple years,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"but I grew up in Jersey."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"So, on one part, you know, every generation of my family"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"for 100 years is born in New York City, including me."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And we've talked about this on my --"

01:00:28;01:00:29;"Yours will say --"

01:01:02;01:01:04;"It's been discussed. I got to recharge my batteries."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"And you, like, build a recording studio in the garage."

01:01:09;01:01:10;"I mean, this is almost sad."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"We got a new car."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"Yeah? In the household."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"Congrats. Thank you."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"I wasn't really part of the decision-making process."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"I have access --"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"I have access to the car of the household in which I reside."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Okay. It's probably the best way to put it."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Is your name on the title?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"No. Okay."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"But I do have a driver's license."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I have a California driver's license now."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Is that new?"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Yeah, 'cause my old one expired..."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"All right. ...when I turned --"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"on my last birthday."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"But on the interface of this car,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"you can listen to radio from all over the world."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"Interesting."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"I mean, the headlines are there, like,"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"""You want to listen to BBC One in London?"""
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Right. So you can, like, throw that on."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"So I've occasionally done that."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"It's like I'm driving."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"It's like, you know, 4 p.m. in L.A.,"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"listening to some, like, late-night, like,"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"techno show on BBC."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"Yeah."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"But also, you can get really specific."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"You can say -- They'll be like, ""Choose a country."""

01:02:09;01:02:12;"And it'll be like New York City radio, Buffalo, New York,"

01:02:15;01:02:17;"So, anyway, I started just out of nostalgia,"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"like, looking at the radio stations I grew up with,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"and I've always said, and it's always worth repeating,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"because this is an Internet radio show,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"that I was -- It was a big part of my life,"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"and I think my development as a musician and a person,"

01:02:39;01:02:41;"Absolutely."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"So, sometimes when I'm driving around in the car,"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"I'll just throw on New Jersey radio."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"And the other day, I was listening to this show"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"that's been on forever out there."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"It's called the Glenn Jones Radio Program"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"featuring X-Ray Burns."

01:02:56;01:02:58;"They're just talking about music and [bleep]"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"and they're telling stories about, like,"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"growing up in these towns"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"that are very close to where I grew up."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"So, I was just, like, you know, ripping around L.A."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"You know, just for, like, a brief moment,"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"just, like, hearing these guys just talk about,"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"like, Jersey and [bleep]"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"I was, like, damn, maybe I got to go back."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"'Cause I said before on the show,"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"my nostalgia for the East Coast"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"is not about Manhattan or New York City."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"It's Jersey. Or Brooklyn."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Well, it's about the whole East Coast."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"I would live in Connecticut, by the way."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"Interesting."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"I think what defines being around the East Coast"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"is Italian people,"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"which you have in New Jersey and Connecticut."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Sure. And Italian delis."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"There's a great Italian deli in New Haven."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"Ooh, there's some good Italian food in Connecticut."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"The pizza, the weather."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"Okay, that's where you lose me a little bit, but okay."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"I mean, it's part of it."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"I get it, though. I get it."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"Going down the shore, the accents."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"That's where you're from, man."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"It truly is the East Coast to me."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"So, I would live in Connecticut."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"I love Connecticut."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"I have good memories of Connecticut."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"But, you know, New Jersey's a little bit more where I'm from."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"I think if you were going to go..."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"It's all about the region."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"And that's my thing. I've always said this about New York."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"Is that, and I was saying, when I first got to Columbia,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"I'd meet, like, kids, some kids from the city,"
01:04:03;01:04:06;"but I'd also meet kids from, like, up and down the East Coast,"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"or California, who would immediately develop a snobbery about New Jersey."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"And I'd always be like, ""What are you talking about?"""
01:04:12;01:04:13;"Yeah."
01:04:13;01:04:16;"What's cool about the New York region"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"is not necessarily downtown Manhattan."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"I mean, I like downtown Manhattan."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"I like Brooklyn, whatever."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"But the whole thing that's interesting to me"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"is the fact that there's 30-plus million people"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"living all around here,"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"taking the train in and out."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"And when you're in Midtown,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"there's people from Connecticut, New Jersey,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"and people working during the day and going home."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"And it's like, you know, there's something interesting"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"about the whole ecosystem."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I've always felt that way."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"So I consider Connecticut a part of that."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Tri-state area."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Tri-state. I think, I remember that's a conversation we had,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"where you said that Connecticut"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"really wasn't pulling its weight in the tri-state."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah, it's really not."
01:04:51;01:04:54;"It's really the bi-state area."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"No, I mean, Connecticut's a part of it."
01:04:56;01:04:56;"No, it is."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"I like Connecticut."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"And I'm sorry, Andrew, if I gave the impression"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"that I didn't respect Connecticut."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"It's no surprise to me that interesting people"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"come out of Connecticut."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"And keep in mind, again,"
01:05:06;01:05:10;"New Jersey is a much-hated state."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"The fact that it's produced anything of note"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"is pretty amazing."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"It's not a cool place."

01:07:04;01:07:06;"- Where does Bruce Springsteen-- what city is he in?"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"- Southern Jersey, right? - He lives in Rumson."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"It's not southern. It's central. - Up central."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"- It's not far, that far from where I live."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"But, yeah, I think he lives on a farm."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"- He has, like, a horse farm."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- Yeah, he has horses and sh--."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- That's, like, a real rich guy move."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"- I want to do that one day. Just got to keep on truckin'."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- I just never-- - I mean, do you like horses?"
01:07:24;01:07:27;"No, I don't-- I mean, isn't it just kind of a money pit?"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"Yeah, it kind of is, but, uh..."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- No, imagine if you're just, like--"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"- I just want the status of having horses."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"I don't actually think it's-- - I don't know."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"I don't think it's like that for Bruce."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- I know. - But imagine if you're hanging"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"with Bruce and you're just like, ""Jesus, look at the size of that horse."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"Must be expensive feeding that thing."""
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Is it a real money pit, Bruce?"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- You know, man, it's crazy."
01:07:43;01:07:47;"I actually make more money off of the horses now than music."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"You're kidding me. - I breed these things."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- You're kidding me, man."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Oh, man, I'd have to take the E Street Band out"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"for three to four weeks for what I can make"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"just on one of these ponies."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"Damn, Bruce, that's cool, man."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"- I was on a horse about a month ago."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"[laughter]"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"- First time? - No, but first time"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"in about 20 years. I did a little horseback riding in Idaho."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- What was that all about?"
01:08:09;01:08:12;"- Well, we went on a little vacation up to, uh, um,"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"a tourist ranch in Stanley, Idaho,"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"which is kind of at the-- right at the edge"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"of the Sawtooth Mountains, central Idaho,"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"very beautiful country."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"And we stayed at this, like, nice--"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"- Sawtooth Mountains. - Lodge."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"And you could, um, if you want, it's like,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"that's a thing you can do there."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"You can raft down a river."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"You can do a horseback ride. We did both."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"- So you guys-- - We flew to Boise."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- How did you make this decision?"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Like, a few months ago, you were like,"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"""Be nice to get out of town this summer."""
01:08:38;01:08:39;"- Yeah. - Where you want to go."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"And you were just like, ""I heard there's some real pretty country"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"up near the Sawtooth Mountains."""
01:08:42;01:08:44;"- Hannah has been to this."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"I mean, you want the full backstory?"
01:08:45;01:08:49;"- Kind of. I'm very interested in why people go on trips."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"- My wife, Hannah--"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"- This is also just, like, real, just, like,"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"adult contemporary radio station."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"- Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. - Just, like, the brief moments of talk."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"- ""So how you been? Well, I just got back"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"from a beautiful ranch up in Idaho."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"My wife and I headed up there."""
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Yeah, I want the backstory. - Great wine."
01:09:04;01:09:07;"Um, when she was a teenager,"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"she was really into figure skating."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"- Mm. - And up--"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- Like, she did figure skate. - Yes."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"So she and her folks went to this"
01:09:15;01:09:19;"figure skating camp or something a few years,"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"which was in Sun Valley, Idaho,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"which is about an hour and a half from this lodge"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"that we stayed at."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"And so her family somehow got hip to this lodge,"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"and they stayed there one year."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"And then her mom was a journalist"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"and wrote a piece about the lodge,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"which was published in ""The New York Times."""
01:09:37;01:09:40;"- That's major for a lodge in the Sawtooth Mountains."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"- And actually, her article is framed"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"hanging in the hallway of this lodge still."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"- That's sick. - And the article's"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"from about 20 years ago. - Mm-hmm."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"- So Hannah and her family have been back to that lodge"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"a few times. - So what were the activities"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"that you enjoyed if you didn't enjoy the horse riding?"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"- This is the--"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"This is almost a ""This Show Rules"" moment."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"- Yeah. [laughter]"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"- This is the most, like--"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"We're just, like, having lunch."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"""What's up, man? I saw you in Instagram."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"You went to Idaho."""
01:10:07;01:10:09;"- Oh, yeah, it was a gorgeous trip."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- Yeah, man, it was--"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Well, I sat on the porch, I did some drawing,"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"I wrote some lyrics, I did some--"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- Oh, tight. - I read part of a"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"Philip Roth novel. - Oh, 'cause he had just died?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"You thought you were gonna break him off?"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- Yeah, I was like, ""I've never read 'American Pastora.'"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"I want to dive into that."" - Takes place in Jersey."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"- That's a real Jersey. Have you read that book?"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"- Oh, yeah, that's a classic Jersey novel."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"- I was thinking about you, actually."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah, and, you know-- - And yeah, there are a lot of"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"things that takes place in Morristown,"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"which is one county over from where I grew up."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- A lot of Newark. - Oh, yeah, first it starts"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"in Newark, yeah. - A lot of Manhattan, too."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"It's a real tri-state area kind of book."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- Right. A few passing scenes in seat two."
01:10:40;01:10:43;"- Did some fun rafting, did some horseback riding,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"did some solo hiking. - In the Sawtooth Mountains?"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"- Oh, yeah, solo. - Solo in the Sawtooth."
01:10:48;01:10:51;"- Yeah. Went off the trail, did a little bushwhacking."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"- Oh, really? - I was like, ""You know what?"""
01:10:53;01:10:55;"- That's dangerous. - It was, but I was like--"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"It wasn't dangerous, but I was like--"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"'Cause one of those trails where you hike out and back,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"and I hiked out down to this lake, and then I was like,"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"""Ooh, I bet if I just walk over that ridge there,"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"it'll be like-- I'll be able to see the road."""
01:11:06;01:11:08;"Worked out great. - You were right."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"- Oh, yeah. - As Tom Cray's listeners know,"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"I'm just like-- I just have a hard time"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"with vacations. - I know you're on, like,"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"a no-travel vibe 'cause you tour."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"I get it. - Well, you know what?"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"In the past few months, we did a show,"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"and I've been kind of kicking into gear"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"for the album and stuff, so I've made a few more trips"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"to London. - Mm-hmm."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"- And I do find that I have, like, a sentimental connection"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"to London and England, the whole UK."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"- I dig it. - So I'm always kind of, like,"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"excited to be there. - But, like, going to, like,"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"Utah to, like, check out, like, Zion National Park,"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"that's not in your wheelhouse? - No, I wanted--"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"I mean, we've talked about this."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"We gotta go on a camping trip. - Right."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"- Just because I've never done it."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"I could imagine it's one of those things,"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"kind of like fasting, as we've talked about,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"that, you know, the first couple days,"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"you're like, ""What is this?"" - Yeah."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"- And suddenly you're, like, possessed by this clarity"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"and energy you haven't known in years."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I could imagine that's what it would be like to go camping,"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"that at first you're just like, ""The [bleep]"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"""I feel dirty."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"""I don't have access to my snack drawer."
01:12:05;01:12:06;"""I don't have Wi-Fi,"" or whatever,"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"and then, like, a few days in, you're just like,"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"""I can't, you know, I feel reborn."""
01:12:10;01:12:13;"Is that how you feel? - I don't know if I'd say reborn."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"It's rewarding, but I don't--"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"I mean, I'm not a very melodramatic guy."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Like, what situation would I be in where I'm like,"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"""Dude, I'm so reborn right now""?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"- Just completed a half marathon?"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"- No, I would be like, ""Oh, dude."""
01:12:26;01:12:28;"[laughter]"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"- Let's hike part of the John Muir Trail next year, dude."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- Yeah, I guess I never feel reborn either."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"- I'd love to do, like, a southern Utah--"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"northern Arizona trip. I think that would be cool."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"You know, it's, like, a couple trips that I want to do."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"- I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before,"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"but just real quick, when you're hiking,"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"what's happening?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Is this one foot after the other, just like--"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"- Yeah, you're zoned out."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"- You're not-- - I mean, you could have earbuds in."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- You're not talking to your hiking companions?"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- Frequently, you are."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"It's better to talk, 'cause then it goes by."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"- I mean, it is deeply pointless."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- I guess. - And frequently painful."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"- No, I mean, I'm a bit of a city slicker,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"but I do admire nature."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"You know, lately, I've been-- - ""Admire."""
01:13:05;01:13:07;"- Like, lately, I've been really into watching"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"""Planet Earth 2"" a lot. - Oh, nice, dude."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"- So sick. I like animals."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"I like to watch animals."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"My last kind of vacation, I guess,"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"was--I don't know if I-- I can't remember"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"if I talked about this."
01:13:16;01:13:19;"The time crisis timeline is crazy."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"But remember we prerecorded an episode fairly recently"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"because I was in Japan? - Yeah."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"- 'Cause we were on tour, so we played the festival"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"in Australia. - Mm-hmm."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- And then we played the festival in Japan"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"right after Bob Dylan, which was tight."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Watched him side stage. - Wow."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"- But so we had about a week off in Tokyo."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"Great city. Had some friends out there."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"Among them, Ariel and Danielle came out."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Danielle Haim, she performed with us."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"And so we had, like, a week of just, like,"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"chilling, walking around."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"And, you know, in a way, that was deeply pointless too."
01:13:48;01:13:50;"It's like, you just walk around Tokyo,"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"kind of no destination in mind,"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"pop into stores, look at things,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"drink a lot of coffee. - That was starting"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"to drive me crazy. - It felt pretty surreal"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"when we got to, like, day five."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"- What are we doing? - But there was something"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"where I kind of felt like-- I did feel like,"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"okay, this is different than normal life."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"Some days put down, like, 20,000 steps."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"Some days just be drinking that, like,"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"fourth coffee of the day at, like, 5:30."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"- Jesus. - Just sitting in a cafe."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"But there was something about it that just felt like,"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"on one hand, deeply pointless,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"partially because we'd been to Japan before."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"So it was interesting just to walk around."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"It wasn't like that kind of tense feeling of, like,"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"we have to go see the temple,"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"then we have to go to the museum."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"- Right, right. - Then we have to go"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"to this one restaurant somebody told us."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"It was like everything was just, like, mellow."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"- Nice. - Just kind of one foot"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"after the other, looking at this, looking at that."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"Somebody in the gang wants to go to that store,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"walk into the store, just kind of look around."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Sometimes I cared, sometimes I didn't."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"And there's something about that that I imagine"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"maybe is how you feel about hiking,"
01:14:47;01:14:50;"just gliding through an interesting place,"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"looking around, not putting too much thought"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"into every little thing."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- It's the journey, not the destination."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Exactly."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"But I'd like to try it out in nature."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"- Well, I'm game, dude."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"TC road trip."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"- Should we do the top five?"
01:15:04;01:15:07;"- It's time for the top five."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"- This is the top five because it's the year"
01:15:22;01:15:26;"that Jake and John Mayer were born in Connecticut."
01:15:26;01:15:30;"The number five single this week in 1977"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"was by the Floaters, and it's called ""Float On."""
01:15:33;01:15:36;"- It's also worth noting that we've done 77,"
01:15:36;01:15:39;"like, probably four or five times this year,"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"and it is always abysmal."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"- It tends to be brutal."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"- It is truly, like, the dregs of pop music."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"- Even though there's such great music from that time."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- It wasn't in the top five."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"- ""Float On"" is good."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"- Yeah, it's already got that '77 sound."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"- Yeah."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"- Aquarius."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"- And school."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"- Yeah."
01:16:07;01:16:11;"- Now I like a woman who loves her freedom,"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"and I like a woman who can hold her own."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"And if you fit that description, baby,"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"you're in with me."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"- I would have guessed this is, like, from '72,"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"if I'd just heard this."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"- That sounds like a Selena."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Remember we talked about the fake strings keyboard?"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"- Oh, yeah, you're right."
01:16:30;01:16:36;"- Let me show you how sweet it could be"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Sharing love with me"
01:16:39;01:16:42;"- The idea for the lyrics was to spotlight each member of the band"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"who introduced themselves with their name and astrological sign."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"- Come on."
01:16:46;01:16:50;"- Float on, float on"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"- Libra."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"- And my name is Charles."
01:17:01;01:17:05;"Now I like a woman that's quiet,"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"a woman who carries herself light."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"Miss Universe."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- Okay."
01:17:17;01:17:21;"Take my hand"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"Come with me, baby"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"- This is like a sexy song."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"- Yeah, this is reminding me of ""Boogie Nights."""
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- Uh-huh."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"- I don't think it's in the movie,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"but this is definitely the palette."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"- Jake, what's your sign?"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"- Age of Aquarius."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"- Are you Aquarius?"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"- Yeah."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"What about you?"
01:17:39;01:17:40;"- Aries."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"- That doesn't mean much to me."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"Some people are really into signs."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"- I don't follow it."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"- You know, there's a lot of planets in retrograde this summer."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"- That explains a lot."
01:17:47;01:17:50;"- We're just kind of coming out in the past few weeks."

01:17:58;01:17:59;"Oh, that's the name of the band?"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Yeah."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"- No, I don't."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Are they Australian?"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"- Five Seconds of Summer?"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- Yeah."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Kind of interesting name."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"- They're kind of like a pop punk band"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"that has a bit of a boy band quality."

01:46:14;01:46:15;"Wait, keep it going."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"Ugh."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"He's doing his own head."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"Yeah."
01:47:10;01:47:12;"I guess that happens when you get older."
01:47:12;01:47:18;"I sometimes find that on Time Crisis, like, partially what's good about being young as an artist is not that you're smarter."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"It's actually that you're dumber."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"You're not overthinking it."
01:47:21;01:47:26;"Well, and also that you're sometimes less—if you have less experience—"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Fewer tools."
01:47:27;01:47:31;"You have fewer tools, and you can also just be almost like crueler or something."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Like, we've talked about it."
01:47:33;01:47:37;"Sometimes when a new wave of music comes out, the Sex Pistols come out, and they have to say, ""We hate the Beatles."""
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Right."
01:47:38;01:47:39;"""The Beatles suck."""
01:47:39;01:47:41;"All these people are like, ""Oh, my God. How could you say the Beatles suck?"""
01:47:41;01:47:44;"And then, like, later somebody else comes out and be like, ""The Sex Pistols suck."""
01:47:44;01:47:48;"And then, like, you know, like, Lil Yachty comes out and say, ""I don't know who Tupac is,"" or whatever."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"And then everybody's like, ""Oh, my God. You don't know who Tupac is?"""
01:47:50;01:47:55;"And then in five years, somebody will just, like, come around and be like, ""I don't listen to f---ing SoundCloud. Lil Uzi sucks."""
01:47:55;01:47:57;"And everybody's like, ""Oh, my God. You don't listen to Lil—"""
01:47:57;01:47:58;"It's, like, so predictable."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"Know your history, son."
01:48:00;01:48:06;"What Lil Uzi accomplished for you, young man—and it's like everybody's always surprised when it happens."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"That's hilarious."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"It's like, can we just, like, accept this as a part of what happens?"
01:48:09;01:48:18;"So, anyway, when you're young, you can just come out and say, like, ""That s--- sucks,"" versus, like, you get a little older and we listen to music from the past, and
you're like, ""Hey, man, everybody's on their own trip. Life's hard."""
01:48:18;01:48:20;"I guess not Eminem—or maybe even Eminem."
01:48:20;01:48:24;"Eminem's gotten almost too compassionate because back then they'd just be like, ""F--- Lil Yachty."""
01:48:24;01:48:27;"And he's like, ""Some people like Lil Yachty, not me. I'm not dissing it. I'm just—"""
01:48:27;01:48:28;"Not for me."
01:48:28;01:48:33;"""He's a young guy. I was a young guy, too. You know, the more I think about it, I probably shouldn't even be talking about Lil Yachty."
01:48:33;01:48:37;"And you guys probably think I'm just an old man ranting. I'm just a sour puss."""
01:48:37;01:48:40;"""Yeah, man, maybe you're right. Look, life is hard. Can we agree on this?"""
01:48:40;01:48:41;"Okay, album's over."
01:48:41;01:48:45;"Nobody makes it to age 45 without a few scars."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"It's that, but he's yelling at all."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"Yeah."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"He still sounds so bad."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"That's funny."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"""I don't like young people!"""
01:48:52;01:48:56;"Career slowed down a little bit. Put on a few pounds."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"""I don't like young people."""
01:48:58;01:49:00;"One thing I'll say is that—"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"I love the phrase ""young people."""
01:49:03;01:49:06;"""I don't like young people!"""
01:49:06;01:49:12;"I remember there's a Brian Wilson album from the early 2000s, and there's this song on there."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"He's talking about driving around the city on a Saturday morning."
01:49:14;01:49:18;"He's just like, ""Young people washing their cars."""
01:49:18;01:49:23;"It's just like the phrase ""young people."""
01:49:23;01:49:27;"The whole reason Eminem's so easy to parody is because he's accomplished so much."
01:49:27;01:49:30;"He's created such an archetype."
01:49:30;01:49:34;"I guess whatever. People say everybody reaches the moment of self-parody eventually."
01:49:34;01:49:38;"I would also say it's like, on one level, you look at someone like Eminem,"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"and he seems like a guy who really cares."
01:49:40;01:49:46;"Everything I've ever heard about Eminem, he doesn't seem like somebody who just needs to hog the limelight."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"He's gone through these long periods where he drops off the face of the earth."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"I bet he has a compulsion just to keep rapping."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"Sure."
01:49:53;01:49:56;"In fact, the music sounds like somebody with a compulsion just to rap, rap, rap, rap."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"It's tough."
01:49:57;01:50:01;"There's some people who reach enlightenment by the time they're 45 and are like,"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"""Listen, man, I don't have to participate in this. I've made a lot of money."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"I just want to spend time with my family."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"My daughter Haley is in college."""
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Whatever."
01:50:09;01:50:13;"There's some people who would just be like, ""I don't need to really release me."""
01:50:13;01:50:17;"If it takes me five, seven years to think of what I want to say in my next record,"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"that's how long it'll take."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"I don't need to just fill up words."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"That's like the Leonard Cohen model."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Really working, a diligent poet."
01:50:25;01:50:29;"And then there's people who are just so desperate to stay relevant."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"I don't think Eminem's quite that."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"No, not at all."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"I think he comes across that way to some people."
01:50:33;01:50:38;"I think Eminem is literally just a compulsion to rap, and this is what he knows how to do."
01:50:38;01:50:39;"He's not fooling himself."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"He's, I guess, at least grappling with the fact that, ""I don't like young people,"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"and you guys probably think that I'm an old person."""
01:50:45;01:50:46;"He at least grapples with it."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"I don't know if that makes it any better."
01:50:48;01:50:52;"The number one song in 1977 was The Emotions, ""Best of My Love."""
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"There's so many songs called ""Best of My Love."""
01:50:55;01:50:56;"Oh, this is a big Boogie Nights song."
01:50:56;01:50:58;"This is the opening number."
01:50:58;01:51:02;"Yeah, R.I.P. Burt Reynolds, a.k.a. Jack Horner."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"Wait, the Eagles have a song called ""Best of My Love,"" right?"
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Yeah, which is probably--"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Maybe a year or two after this."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"Yeah, or before."
01:51:09;01:51:14;"So this is composed by the very talented Maurice White and Al McKay of Earth, Wind & Fire."
01:51:14;01:51:22;"Never will I feel discouraged 'cause our love's no mystery."
01:51:22;01:51:26;"Demonstrating love and affection."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"Love and affection."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"And it feels so openly, yeah."
01:51:30;01:51:34;"I love the way you make me feel about you, baby."
01:51:34;01:51:38;"You're the whole wide world to see."
01:51:38;01:51:42;"Oh, you got the best of my love."
01:51:42;01:51:43;"I always get confused."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"How does the Eagles' song go?"
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Oh, it's a ballad."
01:51:46;01:51:48;"It's like--"
01:51:48;01:51:56;"Oh, sweet darling, you get the best of my love."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"Remember it?"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Yes, I've heard it."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"Sort of."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"This is a better ""Best of My Love."""
01:52:00;01:52:04;"Yeah, I mean, the Eagles' one's a real kind of gaudy ballad."
01:52:04;01:52:07;"I could picture a slower version of this with Don Henley singing."
01:52:07;01:52:12;"Oh, you got the best of my love."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Couldn't you picture that?"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"Sure."
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Doesn't exist, though."
01:52:15;01:52:20;"Like, if they kept writing songs in the direction of ""One of These Nights"""
01:52:20;01:52:22;"and had really gone full, like, Eagles disco."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Yeah."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"Oh, you got the best of my love."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"I always get confused."
01:52:28;01:52:33;"How does the Eagles' song go?"
01:52:33;01:52:34;"This is a great song."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Yeah, it's awesome."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Far and away the best song in the top five so far."
01:52:37;01:52:42;"The number one song is another white rapper, but it's not Eminem, back in 2018."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"Post?"
01:52:43;01:52:46;"No, I'm being facetious when I say it's a white rapper."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"It's Imagine Dragons."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"They kind of rap sometimes."
01:52:48;01:52:52;"I also got to say, we've heard so much of Imagine Dragons on this show,"
01:52:52;01:52:55;"we've occasionally poked fun, but I was just talking about them with somebody"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"recently, and I was like, we were talking about some other band that we didn't"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"like, and I was like, you know what?"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"When you think about that band, how whack they are, it makes you realize"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"you've got to [bleep] give it up for Imagine Dragons."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"I just respect them."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"That's a funny way to look at it."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"This other band that really sucks, they're not that bad."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"It's like the Lil Yachty."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"No, but I was just saying--"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"It's just like--"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"No, but it's also like when you get older, it's like--"
01:53:17;01:53:20;"Imagine Dragons, they make big, epic stuff."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"It's so easy to poke holes at."
01:53:22;01:53:26;"I legitimately like a few of their songs now, and I'll also just say that there's"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"a naturalness to what they do."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"You know, at a certain point, you just got to respect anybody who just does"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"their thing and it feels natural."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"You mean like they have their own sound?"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Actually, I didn't even mean to do this, but the song is called ""Natural."""
01:53:36;01:53:37;"Actually, I want to hear it now."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"You mean like it feels organic to what--"
01:53:42;01:53:46;"like their creative writing process feels organic to you?"
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Yes."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"As opposed to like--"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"His voice sounds right singing these songs."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"Right, right."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"There's a sincerity or an authenticity."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"I feel you."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"And he's got his own flavor, you know?"
01:54:03;01:54:14;"Ooh, it's a little Hotel California."
01:54:21;01:54:37;"This song was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 college football season."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Okay."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"The second time that Imagination Dragons received that honor."
01:55:39;01:55:44;"Well, that was a hell of a top five."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"I mean, I got to say the high point for me of both years"
01:55:47;01:55:51;"was engaging with the new Eminem record, which I hadn't done previously."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"I feel you."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Eminem is a fascinating character."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:55:55;01:55:58;"I loved Marshall Mathers' LP back then."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"That's the second one?"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"And I loved him on 2001."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"Yeah."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"Has he been doing press?"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I'd love just to see an in-depth Eminem interview."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"There's been no recent press."
01:56:07;01:56:10;"How come Eminem's not headlining the New Yorker Festival?"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"That would be tight."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"That would be--"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Yeah, they should replace Steve Bannon with Eminem."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"Someone else would get pissed, but not nearly as pissed."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"I think Eminem would probably have a lot to say"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"about what's happening in America with Steve Bannon."
01:56:21;01:56:25;"I would love a conversation between David Remnick and Eminem."
01:56:25;01:56:26;"That would be fascinating."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"That'd be tight."
01:56:27;01:56:32;"I miss the wacky Eminem where he'd dress up his characters"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"and put on a wig and dance."
01:56:34;01:56:37;"And even that got old, certainly by the fourth album."
01:56:37;01:56:40;"It was kind of like every time Eminem came back,"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"he would have to start off with one song"
01:56:42;01:56:45;"that's kind of like him addressing pop culture."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"The lead single would always-- yeah."
01:56:47;01:56:50;"And dressing up as everybody in the video and making fun of them."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"But now I miss that."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"He's been away from that for so long."
01:56:53;01:56:56;"I always reference Eminem when I talk about the album"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"that we were working on, the fourth album,"
01:56:58;01:57:01;"because I'd always be like, ""Eminem's a good cautionary tale,"""
01:57:01;01:57:03;"because for his first three albums--"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"I might have the numbers wrong, but bear with me for argument's sake."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"I'd always say Eminem's first three albums,"
01:57:08;01:57:12;"they always led with a high-energy, kind of bratty, annoying song."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"And he killed it."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"It was like, ""Hi, my name is--"""
01:57:15;01:57:18;"And then it was like, ""Eminem, Eminem, this--"""
01:57:18;01:57:21;"Then eventually it was like, ""Now this looks like a job for me."""
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Without me."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"And then there was the Pee Wee Herman one."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"Yeah."
01:57:25;01:57:27;"I just remember there was an album where it was just like,"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"""It was one too many."""
01:57:29;01:57:33;"And it was like, ""One too many of the bratty, guess-who-back songs."""
01:57:33;01:57:36;"Well, there was the fourth one that was the Pee Wee Herman,"
01:57:36;01:57:39;"and then there was the one after that where he was like--"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Do you remember it was like Kim Kardashian?"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"He was making fun of Lindsay Lohan and Ellen DeGeneres."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"That sounds right."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"And it was like so-- it was like, ""Two too many."""
01:57:47;01:57:50;"I just always say, just because something worked three times,"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"don't get cocky."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"It might not work four times."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"You've got to rethink."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Once you've successfully did something three times,"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"really take a second and rethink."
01:57:58;01:58:01;"Formulas don't work forever."
01:58:01;01:58:04;"It's just so obvious in a way that it's like the first thing would always be,"
01:58:04;01:58:09;"""Guess who's back? Guess who's back?"""
01:58:09;01:58:14;"""I'm back, and I don't like young people."""
01:58:14;01:58:16;"All right, well, that's it for Time Crisis this week."
01:58:16;01:58:19;"We'll see you in two weeks, and again, apologies to the MCU."
01:58:19;01:58:20;"We respect you."
01:58:20;01:58:21;"We love you."
01:58:21;01:58:25;"Just to occasionally burn out on some of that fan-pleasing stuff."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"All right, talk to you soon."
01:58:27;01:58:28;"Bye."
01:58:28;01:58:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:58:32;01:58:36;"Beats 1."
