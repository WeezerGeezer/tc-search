00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, February, Jake's birthday month, so much to discuss. The Grammys, the Super"
00:08;00:17;"Bowl, Diet Coke, Lady Doritos. This show is just jammed. I'm gonna keep it real with you"
00:17;00:26;"guys. Anyway, we'll also be counting down the top 5 hits of today in 1977. This is Time"
00:26;00:33;"Crisis with Ezra King. Peace. One."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the boss had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave it all in the air"
01:16;01:20;"Time Crisis, February 2018. What up, Jake?"
01:20;01:21;"Not much."
01:21;01:23;"It's funny doing a show every two weeks because..."
01:23;01:24;"I know, a lot happens."
01:24;01:28;"We miss, yeah, especially this time of year. This is awards season."
01:28;01:32;"Do people count the Super Bowl as part of awards season?"
01:32;01:33;"Yeah, they should."
01:33;01:39;"We got the Golden Globes, Grammys, Super Bowl, and the Oscars all within a couple months."
01:39;01:43;"It's a very exciting time. So, do we even want to talk about the Grammys?"
01:43;01:46;"I don't know. I didn't watch them. Did you watch them?"
01:46;01:47;"No, I didn't watch them either."
01:47;01:49;"This is a real current events kind of show."
01:49;01:51;"I was at a barbecue at CT's house."
01:51;01:52;"Oh, that's tight."
01:52;01:54;"Yeah, chopping it up with CT."
01:54;01:57;"Was anyone following the Grammys on their phone?"
01:57;02:00;"No, because I think I've said this on the show before."
02:00;02:05;"The Grammys, less and less as I get older, but the Grammys have always given me a weird feeling."
02:05;02:12;"Because since I've been a professional musician, either I've been there, and then you've got the stress of being there,"
02:12;02:15;"or I haven't been there, and then you're thinking about it."
02:15;02:22;"It's weird. You're better off not thinking about it. It can make you feel left out or confused."
02:22;02:23;"Hurt."
02:23;02:24;"So, you've been multiple times?"
02:24;02:25;"Perturbed."
02:25;02:26;"How many times have you been?"
02:26;02:28;"I've been in the Grammys three times."
02:28;02:30;"Damn, that's a lot."
02:30;02:36;"Yeah, because we were nominated for Contra, lost out to the Black Keys."
02:36;02:40;"Then we came back, Modern Vampires won that one."
02:40;02:45;"And then I went, I think I talked about this, I went because I was nominated for the Beyonce album."
02:45;02:46;"Right, that was a year ago."
02:46;02:49;"I went, and I was defeated by my good friend Arielle."
02:49;02:53;"And there was the whole sort of like conflict of, do I get on stage?"
02:53;02:56;"Yeah, luckily it was a non-issue."
02:56;02:58;"Although I think I said this last time, I was sitting there with Diplo,"
02:58;03:02;"and a guy with a clipboard came up to us and was like, ""So you guys are going to be going on stage?"""
03:02;03:03;"And we were like, ""What?"""
03:03;03:05;"And he was like, ""Yeah, for album of the year."""
03:05;03:07;"And we were like, ""Maybe, we're not sure."""
03:07;03:08;"And then he walked away."
03:08;03:12;"And so me and Diplo were both like, ""Oh, Beyonce won. I guess that's what he's telling us."""
03:12;03:13;"He's giving us a heads up."
03:13;03:14;"Right, right, I remember that."
03:14;03:18;"So then we're standing there, and then I looked at Diplo, and I was like, ""Do we want to go up?"""
03:18;03:19;"It's her moment."
03:19;03:23;"And as we've discussed, usually when somebody wins, all the producers come up."
03:23;03:27;"Although I think they changed the rules now, so not all the producers win."
03:27;03:31;"But so we were discussing, and then we were like, ""No, let's not go up. But it's cool that she won."""
03:31;03:34;"And then they were like, ""And the Grammy goes to Adele."""
03:34;03:35;"Flabbergasted."
03:38;03:43;"You put your hands on, on my body and told me"
03:43;03:50;"You told me you were ready for the big one, for the big jump"
03:50;03:54;"I'd be your last love, everlasting you and me"
03:54;03:59;"That was what you told me"
03:59;04:05;"I'm giving you up, I'm forgiving it all"
04:05;04:10;"You set me free"
04:10;04:13;"Send my love to your new lover"
04:13;04:16;"Treat her better"
04:16;04:19;"We gotta let go of all of our lows"
04:19;04:22;"We both know we ain't kids no more"
04:22;04:25;"Send my love to your new lover"
04:25;04:28;"Treat her better"
04:28;04:31;"We gotta let go of all of our lows"
04:31;04:34;"We both know we ain't kids no more"
04:35;04:40;"Anyway, it was kind of chill to be at a barbecue, and then I just got a text from a friend that's like,"
04:40;04:44;"""Whoa, Bruno Mars won."" And I wrote back like, ""What?"" And they were like, ""Everything."""
04:44;04:46;"And I was like, ""That's tight."""
04:46;04:54;"Remember, I had a theory that I said some people were very excited that there were no white men in the Album of the Year category."
04:54;04:58;"So there was some excitement. This is the first time in a very long time, maybe ever,"
04:58;05:02;"there's no white guys, a group who's dominated a lot of stuff. So people were excited."
05:02;05:07;"And I just remember thinking like, ""Okay, be excited, but just remember,"
05:07;05:13;"sometimes a dopey white guy can be a great buffer. No vote splitting."""
05:13;05:17;"People really hate mediocre white guys, for understandable reasons,"
05:17;05:23;"but one or two mediocre white guys in the Grammys, let them cancel each other out, you know what I'm saying?"
05:23;05:24;"Yeah."
05:24;05:25;"I think the hip-hop vote was split."
05:25;05:26;"Right."
05:26;05:28;"I wanted to see Kendrick win. I said it."
05:28;05:33;"So the Grammys did not award the idiosyncratic original artist."
05:33;05:34;"Yeah."
05:34;05:35;"Is anyone surprised?"
05:35;05:36;"Bombshell."
05:36;05:38;"I mean, come on, right?"
05:38;05:42;"You know, that's what's so funny about it, is that it's just a vote."
05:42;05:45;"And a vote is not always consensus, as we know."
05:45;05:50;"You can become president without winning the most votes, and you can be Album of the Year"
05:50;05:54;"by barely getting the most votes. And we never see the numbers."
05:54;05:56;"Right, you could just be eeking it out."
05:56;06:00;"For all we know, it was like, at the final vote tally, it was like,"
06:00;06:06;"""Bruno Mars, 925 votes. Kendrick, 923. Jay-Z..."""
06:06;06:08;"You know, like, we'll never know."
06:08;06:12;"I wonder, though, in terms of your theory of splitting the rap vote,"
06:12;06:16;"how many people actually voted for the Jay-Z record."
06:16;06:18;"Jay-Z's an incredibly influential guy."
06:18;06:21;"You don't have to tell me that. I'm just saying..."
06:21;06:22;"He's a major dude."
06:22;06:25;"How many people actually voted for his late career record?"
06:25;06:27;"Jay-Z is a major dude."
06:27;06:29;"Any major dude?"
06:29;06:30;"I'm just saying..."
06:30;06:34;"Well, first of all, the Grammys historically award late career major dudes."
06:34;06:36;"Oh, like Steely Dan in '94."
06:36;06:37;"The Steely Dan in the 2000s."
06:37;06:40;"Oh, no, that's right. Not '94. What am I thinking?"
06:40;06:44;"So you think people that, like, basically didn't even hear the Jay-Z record were like,"
06:44;06:47;"""Oh, legacy artist. Vote for him."""
06:47;06:52;"Yeah, because Jay-Z is such an influential guy, and he's walked the corridors of power."
06:52;06:55;"So, you know, you probably get the random person who's like..."
06:55;06:56;"The corridors of power."
06:56;07:00;"You probably get some random old record executive who's voting who's kind of like,"
07:00;07:04;"""Oh, I like Jay. He's a good guy. I sat with him at a Nets game."""
07:04;07:05;"Right."
07:05;07:07;"""And his wife is incredible. What a couple."""
07:07;07:09;"Yeah, I think that happens."
07:09;07:12;"But I feel like that guy's just going to vote for Bruno. That's why he won."
07:12;07:14;"I think it's more complicated than just, like..."
07:14;07:15;"Okay."
07:15;07:17;"I don't think it's like Bruno mopped the floor with everybody else."
07:17;07:19;"I just love to see those numbers. I feel like..."
07:19;07:20;"I know. We got to get the numbers."
07:20;07:23;"I think there's some truth to your theory that they split the rap vote,"
07:23;07:28;"but I'm thinking it's like 85-15 Kendrick."
07:28;07:30;"Maybe that 15 would have put him over the edge."
07:30;07:33;"Look at that. That's Jill Stein in Wisconsin right there."
07:33;07:34;"Exactly."
07:34;07:35;"Boom."
07:35;07:38;"I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA."
07:38;07:41;"Quarter peace, got war and peace inside my DNA."
07:41;07:45;"I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA."
07:45;07:48;"I got hustle, though ambition flow inside my DNA."
07:48;07:52;"I was born like this and spawned like this, immaculate conception."
07:52;07:54;"I transform like this, perform like this, what's y'all's?"
07:54;07:56;"You a new weapon, I don't contemplate."
07:56;07:59;"I meditate, then off your, off your head."
07:59;08:00;"This that put the kids to bed."
08:00;08:02;"This that I got, I got, I got, I got."
08:02;08:05;"Realness, I just kill sh*t 'cause it's in my DNA."
08:05;08:09;"I got millions, I got riches building in my DNA."
08:09;08:12;"I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA."
08:12;08:16;"I got off, I got trouble, some heart inside my DNA."
08:16;08:19;"I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve."
08:19;08:23;"Yeah, that's him again, the sound, the engine, and it's like a burn."
08:23;08:26;"You see fireworks, they call it the tire skirt, the boulevard."
08:26;08:28;"I know how you work, I know just who you are."
08:28;08:30;"See, use it, use it, use it."
08:30;08:34;"You know also the, one of the major dudes at the Grammys, Neil Portnow,"
08:34;08:36;"made this kind of bizarre sexist comment."
08:36;08:38;"I heard about it, didn't see it."
08:38;08:41;"He said something, he apologized, but this is so funny,"
08:41;08:45;"when we talk about stuff like two weeks after the fact, it's like--"
08:45;08:46;"And it's been covered."
08:46;08:49;"It's been covered in like so many things, layers to the story about--"
08:49;08:50;"Yeah, he said something along the lines of,"
08:50;08:52;"so he was like, ""How come more women aren't nominated?"""
08:52;08:53;"He said, ""Women need to step up."""
08:57;09:01;"Very, whatever he meant, not the right way to say it, dude."
09:01;09:04;"But anyway, then there's been a movement where people are like,"
09:04;09:07;"either telling him to step down or at least apologize."
09:07;09:10;"And other people said, ""And by the way, just give us some data"
09:10;09:12;"about like the voting members of the Grammys,"
09:12;09:13;"'cause we've talked about this a lot."
09:13;09:15;"Just break it down for us, man."
09:15;09:17;"Like we know this stuff for president."""
09:17;09:18;"Yeah, why so secretive?"
09:18;09:20;"I don't know, because as I've said,"
09:20;09:24;"if you looked at everybody who's eligible to vote in the Grammys,"
09:24;09:25;"I think you're going to get a very diverse bunch,"
09:25;09:28;"because like we said, you only need four or five credits"
09:28;09:29;"of being on a record."
09:29;09:30;"Right."
09:30;09:33;"We had that joke concept that I should have registered"
09:33;09:34;"or whatever to vote."
09:34;09:35;"Yeah."
09:35;09:36;"Well, I should do that this year."
09:36;09:39;"Anyway, yeah, who cares about the Grammys?"
09:39;09:40;"Yeah."
09:40;09:44;"Even if you get it right, it's still going to be just like a funny little--"
09:44;09:46;"Yeah, I mean, awards for art, blah, blah, blah."
10:04;10:05;"Beach house in Miami."
10:05;10:07;"Wake up with no jamming."
10:07;10:09;"Lobster tail for dinner."
10:09;10:10;"Julio served that scampi."
10:10;10:11;"Yo!"
10:11;10:12;"You got it if you want it."
10:12;10:13;"Got it, got it if you want it."
10:13;10:16;"Said you got it if you want it."
10:16;10:18;"Take my wallet if you want it."
10:18;10:20;"Now jump in the Cadillac, girls."
10:20;10:22;"Put some miles on it."
10:22;10:25;"Anything you want, just to put a smile on it."
10:25;10:27;"You deserve it, baby."
10:27;10:28;"You deserve it all."
10:28;10:31;"And I'm gonna give it to you."
10:31;10:34;"New school jewelry shining so bright."
10:34;10:38;"Strawberry champagne on ice."
10:38;10:40;"Lucky for you, that's what I like."
10:40;10:41;"That's what I like."
10:41;10:43;"Lucky for you, that's what I like."
10:43;10:46;"That's what I like."
10:46;10:51;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on B1."
10:51;10:53;"I guess there's also the Super Bowl."
10:53;10:55;"Didn't watch."
10:55;10:55;"You didn't watch?"
10:55;10:57;"No, did you?"
10:57;10:59;"Yeah, I'm a sports nut."
10:59;11:02;"Well-known sports fanatic."
11:02;11:05;"I apologize to any hardcore TC heads who"
11:05;11:08;"like just tuning in to hear us talk about things"
11:08;11:09;"that happened two weeks ago."
11:09;11:11;"But hey, that's part of the charm of this show."
11:11;11:12;"They want our takes."
11:12;11:13;"They want our-- they've been waiting."
11:13;11:15;"Red hot takes."
11:15;11:17;"They've been waiting."
11:17;11:18;"Like literally--"
11:18;11:19;"They've been chambered for two weeks."
11:19;11:21;"They've just been waiting to get this out."
11:21;11:22;"In 2018, an event like the Super Bowl"
11:22;11:25;"is like it's already too much conversation about it"
11:25;11:26;"in real time."
11:26;11:28;"Then the next day, already there's"
11:28;11:30;"this like sick feeling where you read"
11:30;11:31;"all the official coverage."
11:31;11:34;"Like, oh, now these [bleep] are writing articles about it"
11:34;11:35;"and really going to town."
11:35;11:39;"And then by the two days after, it feels like 100 years ago."
11:39;11:40;"It's done."
11:40;11:42;"But then two weeks later, you get the TC bump."
11:42;11:44;"Yep, it kind of resets."
11:44;11:46;"It kind of resets."
11:46;11:47;"So everybody's waiting for us to talk."
11:47;11:49;"Wait, so Jake, I thought you were a sports nut."
11:49;11:52;"Putting the soup in the fridge, and it's a week later."
11:52;11:54;"That's when it's at its best."
11:54;11:55;"Yeah, either eat it--"
11:55;11:57;"So let's just break down the Super Bowl."
11:57;11:59;"--eat it at the restaurant or eat it late night"
11:59;12:02;"when you wake up in the middle of the night"
12:02;12:04;"because you're drunk and you can't sleep."
12:04;12:06;"Maybe you eat it the next morning."
12:06;12:08;"Or after that, it's like the weird uncanny valley."
12:08;12:09;"Wait a week."
12:09;12:10;"Wait two weeks."
12:10;12:12;"So Jake, I thought you were a sports nut, man."
12:12;12:14;"How are you not going to watch football's biggest night?"
12:14;12:15;"Not a football fan."
12:15;12:16;"Never have been."
12:16;12:18;"Also, you know what they always call--"
12:18;12:21;"I've always enjoyed referring to the Grammys as music's biggest"
12:21;12:23;"night because it's what they call it."
12:23;12:26;"So like there's something very like razzle-dazzle"
12:26;12:30;"about calling the Super Bowl football's biggest night."
12:30;12:32;"So Jake, you weren't interested in football's biggest night?"
12:32;12:33;"Not at all."
12:33;12:34;"Why, because--"
12:34;12:35;"Not a football fan."
12:35;12:39;"Because of the brain damage and the right-wing politics and--"
12:39;12:40;"No, not because of that."
12:40;12:42;"Never been a fan of the game."
12:42;12:46;"Always thought it was really boring and really slow."
12:46;12:48;"People say that about baseball."
12:48;12:49;"I--"
12:49;12:49;"You disagree."
12:49;12:51;"I disagree."
12:51;12:52;"I've said this before."
12:52;12:54;"Football, what's an hour of game time"
12:54;12:56;"takes 3 and 1/2 hours."
12:56;12:57;"What-- I mean, what is that?"
12:57;12:58;"That's just-- that's garbage."
12:58;13:00;"I guess because I was--"
13:00;13:02;"I grew up just not being in a sports period,"
13:02;13:06;"the idea of having like liking one sport"
13:06;13:09;"and disliking another sport is so alien to me."
13:09;13:10;"You're like, it's all sports."
13:10;13:11;"It's all just--"
13:11;13:12;"They just all feel so similar."
13:12;13:14;"It's like if you buy into the drama,"
13:14;13:15;"it's easy to get excited."
13:15;13:17;"I've had good times watching football games."
13:17;13:19;"But I just-- it's not--"
13:19;13:20;"that's not where I'm at."
13:20;13:21;"Well--"
13:21;13:22;"So you watched it."
13:22;13:23;"I watched it."
13:23;13:25;"What percentage of you watching it"
13:25;13:28;"had to do with the advertisements and the JT"
13:28;13:30;"halftime show anticipation?"
13:30;13:32;"And what percentage was just like,"
13:32;13:33;"this is going to be a good game?"
13:33;13:35;"I was just kind of like at home."
13:35;13:36;"It was just on."
13:36;13:37;"Solo?"
13:37;13:38;"No, Rashida was already watching it."
13:38;13:39;"She was interested in the--"
13:39;13:40;"Just the two of you?"
13:40;13:41;"Yeah."
13:41;13:42;"No like little Super Bowl party?"
13:42;13:45;"No, we were like tired, a little under the weather."
13:45;13:46;"Felt good to just stay at home."
13:46;13:48;"And yeah, she wanted to watch the ads."
13:48;13:51;"And so, you know, because like it's not just football's biggest"
13:51;13:51;"night."
13:51;13:52;"That's cool."
13:53;13:54;"It's Madison Avenue's biggest night."
13:54;13:55;"That's true."
13:55;13:57;"The Super Bowl is such a hilarious combination"
13:57;13:58;"of things."
13:58;14:02;"It's like the most brutal sport."
14:02;14:04;"Big dudes just hurting each other."
14:04;14:05;"Just crushing each other."
14:05;14:08;"And then you got like intellectual Illuminati,"
14:08;14:10;"you know, trying to like [bleep] with people,"
14:10;14:13;"make them buy [bleep] a bunch of like dorks writing copy."
14:13;14:16;"Yeah, just like eight layers of self-awareness"
14:16;14:17;"deep on these ads."
14:17;14:18;"Yeah."
14:18;14:20;"And then you have like the halftime show, which"
14:20;14:23;"is this like crazy branding musical."
14:23;14:25;"Usually a letdown."
14:25;14:26;"Yeah."
14:26;14:27;"But always fun."
14:27;14:30;"Well, but anyway, this is not a sports show."
14:30;14:33;"Although we did once go really deep on baseball."
14:33;14:33;"Right."
14:33;14:35;"In an infamous episode."
14:35;14:38;"But we're more interested in corporate food and--"
14:38;14:39;"Yeah."
14:39;14:40;"--advertising, things of that nature."
14:40;14:43;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
14:43;14:44;"[gunshot]"
14:44;14:47;"[theme music]"
14:47;14:50;"[theme music]"
15:11;15:14;"[theme music]"
15:14;15:25;"[theme music]"
15:25;15:38;"[theme music]"
15:39;15:43;"[theme music]"
15:44;15:46;"People talked a lot about the best ads."
15:46;15:47;"And they tend to be these ones that"
15:47;15:51;"have that very specific type of like bro-y humor."
15:51;15:53;"But this ad flew a little bit under the radar."
15:53;15:55;"And I was already interested in this ad,"
15:55;15:56;"the one I'm about to talk about."
15:56;15:57;"OK."
15:57;16:01;"Because I'd seen it when I was trying to watch the Gianni"
16:01;16:03;"Versace show."
16:03;16:06;"Even now that you maybe are a cable subscriber,"
16:06;16:08;"that allows you the privilege of watching"
16:08;16:10;"the show on your laptop."
16:10;16:12;"But they're still going to make you watch commercials."
16:12;16:16;"And in some ways, it almost makes"
16:16;16:18;"you nostalgic for the days of just watching a show on TV."
16:18;16:20;"And you're getting hit with a bunch of commercials."
16:20;16:22;"Because now, you know, they just zoom in."
16:22;16:23;"They show you the same [bleep] over and over again."
16:23;16:26;"I'm just trying to enjoy the Versace show."
16:26;16:27;"And they're showing you ads for--"
16:27;16:28;"And they're showing me this one."
16:28;16:30;"So they kept showing this one over and over again."
16:30;16:32;"So I just want to play it first without talking about it."
16:32;16:35;"Look, here's the thing about Diet Coke."
16:35;16:41;"It's delicious."
16:41;16:42;"It makes me feel good."
16:42;16:43;"True that."
16:43;16:44;"Life is short."
16:44;16:46;"If you want to live in a yurt, yurt it up."
16:46;16:47;"If you want to run a marathon--"
16:47;16:51;"I mean, that sounds super hard, but OK."
16:51;16:55;"I mean, just do you, whatever that is."
16:55;16:59;"And if you're in the mood for a Diet Coke, have a Diet Coke."
16:59;17:00;"Diet Coke."
17:00;17:02;"Because I can."
17:02;17:03;"OK, so--"
17:03;17:04;"Is that the new phrase, ""because I can""?"
17:04;17:06;"I mean, it's clearly one of the phrases."
17:06;17:06;"So--"
17:06;17:08;"Holy Christ."
17:08;17:09;"So again, before this was in the Super Bowl,"
17:09;17:11;"I had seen this 10 times in a row"
17:11;17:15;"when I was just trying to enjoy the Versace program."
17:15;17:17;"And I know, you listen to it, and people are probably"
17:17;17:19;"thinking, like, that doesn't sound that weird."
17:19;17:23;"But as we watched it like 10 times on the laptop,"
17:23;17:24;"home and bed, we kind of turned to each other,"
17:24;17:27;"and we're like, this is a very strange commercial."
17:27;17:31;"So the woman in it is Gillian Jacobs, well-known actress."
17:31;17:34;"She was on the show ""Community,"" and now she's on the show ""Love."""
17:34;17:35;"She's cool."
17:35;17:37;"She's kind of like a--"
17:37;17:39;"I don't even know what ""girl next door"" means."
17:39;17:40;"She's just like-- she's like cool."
17:40;17:41;"Approachable."
17:41;17:44;"Approachable, regular, Caucasian woman."
17:44;17:45;"That's her type."
17:45;17:45;"But kind of hip."
17:45;17:46;"Yeah, kind of hip."
17:46;17:47;"On kind of edgy shows."
17:47;17:48;"But you know what?"
17:48;17:49;"Not too hip."
17:49;17:50;"Yeah."
17:50;17:51;"Not uber hipster."
17:51;17:52;"She's like--"
17:52;17:54;"They're not getting MIA to do this ad."
17:54;17:55;"Yeah."
17:55;17:57;"MIA."
17:57;17:58;"Yeah."
17:58;18:00;"They're saying, you know, Pepsi got Kendall Jenner."
18:00;18:02;"We're getting somebody who's cool, but not trying too hard."
18:02;18:03;"Right."
18:03;18:06;"So anyway, I know it seems like pretty normal DyCoke ad,"
18:06;18:10;"but then when I watched it like 12 times,"
18:10;18:11;"we just started to think, what are they"
18:11;18:13;"saying in this commercial?"
18:13;18:17;"Because historically, DyCoke was sold as like, it tastes great"
18:17;18:18;"and it's less calories."
18:18;18:22;"The tone of this is so weird and kind of defensive."
18:22;18:24;"So let's just-- let's break it down."
18:24;18:25;"Listen to the beginning."
18:25;18:25;"OK."
18:25;18:29;"Look, here's the thing about DyCoke."
18:29;18:32;"Here's the thing."
18:32;18:33;"It's delicious."
18:33;18:34;"It makes me feel good."
18:34;18:36;"OK."
18:36;18:39;"So I also love that it's like, you can already"
18:39;18:41;"picture the way they're just making the ad where somebody's"
18:41;18:43;"like, so we're kind of reintroducing DyCoke here."
18:43;18:45;"Like, what should we say about it?"
18:45;18:47;"And somebody's like, everybody knows what DyCoke is."
18:47;18:48;"Let's cut to the chase."
18:48;18:50;"And the guy's like, well, what is the chase?"
18:50;18:53;"Like, I want that girl from community to open a Coke"
18:53;18:54;"and just start drinking it."
18:54;18:55;"A DyCoke."
18:55;18:56;"Like, don't describe it."
18:56;18:59;"So she's like, the tone of the beginning is kind of like,"
18:59;19:01;"can we just cut the bull [bleep] here?"
19:01;19:02;"Like--"
19:02;19:04;"Look, here's the thing about DyCoke."
19:07;19:10;"It's delicious."
19:10;19:12;"It makes me feel good."
19:12;19:17;"So to me, the beginning reads as kind of like,"
19:17;19:19;"DyCoke is on the ropes here."
19:19;19:22;"You know, like in the '90s, maybe in the '80s,"
19:22;19:24;"it wasn't hard to sell people on DyCoke because they were like,"
19:24;19:26;"hey, you know Coke?"
19:26;19:28;"That just unequivocally great American drink"
19:28;19:31;"that everybody loves, but you don't enjoy as much"
19:31;19:32;"because you're concerned with your weight?"
19:32;19:35;"Well, now we have something that is that thing"
19:35;19:38;"that everybody's drinking, except this one,"
19:38;19:39;"you're not going to get fat."
19:39;19:40;"It's win-win."
19:40;19:41;"No questions asked."
19:41;19:43;"This is kind of the social media era where everything's"
19:43;19:44;"questioned and turned over."
19:44;19:47;"Well, soda is just called into question in general."
19:47;19:48;"Soda's already called into question,"
19:48;19:52;"and then diet soda is this weird relic of toxic waste"
19:52;19:56;"from the era where people used to buy these huge narratives"
19:56;19:59;"that we were sold about what was actually good for you."
19:59;20:00;"So this is kind of like, they're like,"
20:00;20:03;"should we try to convince people again that DyCoke is actually"
20:03;20:04;"good, like it helps you diet?"
20:04;20:06;"And they're like, no, that ship has sailed."
20:06;20:08;"We're trying to preserve what we got."
20:08;20:11;"And for us, the DyCoke drinker is not"
20:11;20:13;"somebody trying to lose weight."
20:13;20:17;"The DyCoke drinker is a kind of hedonistic nihilist who's--"
20:17;20:18;"We're basically just selling--"
20:18;20:20;"--who's ready to die."
20:20;20:21;"We're basically just selling beer at this point."
20:21;20:22;"Yeah, exactly."
20:22;20:23;"You're not going to make an argument."
20:23;20:25;"So it's like--"
20:25;20:27;"Light beer is not going to-- you're not going to lose weight."
20:27;20:29;"I know, it's so defensive because it's just like--"
20:29;20:32;"Look, here's the thing about DyCoke."
20:32;20:34;"It's basically like, you see, she's opening a DyCoke,"
20:34;20:37;"and it's like, OK, OK, stop."
20:37;20:38;"I know, I know, I know."
20:38;20:39;"I know, I know."
20:39;20:42;"I know what you assholes are going to say."
20:42;20:43;"Back off."
20:43;20:45;"You're going to say that this shit causes cancer."
20:45;20:47;"You're going to say that this shit doesn't help you diet."
20:47;20:49;"You're going to say I might as well be drinking regular Coke."
20:49;20:50;"But you know what?"
20:50;20:52;"[bleep] you."
20:52;20:53;"It tastes good."
20:53;20:55;"Anybody who tells me it doesn't--"
20:55;20:58;"Plus, it's got the huge old Trump stank on it now."
20:58;20:59;"Oh, yeah."
20:59;21:01;"That's not healthy matters, any."
21:01;21:02;"Exactly."
21:02;21:05;"So she's like, don't say another word."
21:05;21:07;"You're in my house."
21:07;21:08;"I drink DyCoke."
21:08;21:09;"And you know what?"
21:09;21:12;"And also, it used to be-- nobody used to call DyCoke delicious."
21:12;21:14;"It was like tolerable."
21:14;21:16;"The whole point was that it's not as good as--"
21:16;21:18;"It's delicious."
21:18;21:19;"So clinical."
21:19;21:21;"Also, you know, like some people--"
21:21;21:24;"I think we grew up in the era where people would be like,"
21:24;21:25;"you know what's weird?"
21:25;21:27;"I have like this seven-year-old cousin where she actually"
21:27;21:28;"prefers DyCoke."
21:28;21:30;"I think it's because her mom drinks it a lot."
21:30;21:32;"And so people would talk about it."
21:32;21:34;"It's kind of like how some people are like, I'm weird."
21:34;21:36;"I really like the smell of gasoline."
21:36;21:39;"That's my favorite smell."
21:39;21:41;"Because with the implication being"
21:41;21:44;"that when you're at the gas station,"
21:44;21:46;"it kills your brain cells to smell that stuff."
21:46;21:47;"But you know, people would be like--"
21:47;21:48;"it's like a personality type."
21:48;21:50;"Remember when we had the woman from Frito-Lay's"
21:50;21:52;"and she said, we don't worry about demographics."
21:52;21:54;"We think about psychographics, which"
21:55;21:59;"is like the mental type that transcends class and race."
21:59;22:00;"Wow, good recall."
22:00;22:03;"So I'm thinking about the psychographic of this person"
22:03;22:05;"who-- they like the smell of gasoline."
22:05;22:08;"They brush their teeth way too hard to their gums bleed."
22:08;22:11;"And they like the taste of DyCoke."
22:11;22:12;"I'm the first two of those."
22:12;22:14;"OK, so you're almost there."
22:14;22:15;"So I like-- it's also that--"
22:15;22:17;"it's like the gloves are off now."
22:17;22:19;"It's not just-- this is a diet alternative"
22:19;22:21;"to a great tasting drink."
22:21;22:23;"But this one tastes OK."
22:23;22:24;"Now it's just like, you know what, [bleep] you."
22:24;22:25;"I know it's weird."
22:25;22:26;"It stands on its own."
22:26;22:27;"It's weird."
22:27;22:30;"You think I'm a pervert, but it's delicious to me."
22:30;22:33;"She straight up calling DyCoke delicious."
22:33;22:34;"No, and there's like a real--"
22:34;22:35;"That's a change."
22:35;22:37;"There's a real tension in her voice, too."
22:37;22:39;"Look, here's the thing about--"
22:39;22:40;"Oh my goodness."
22:40;22:44;"It's like the eighth time you've heard this."
22:44;22:45;"It's delicious."
22:45;22:46;"It's delicious."
22:46;22:48;"It's so tense."
22:48;22:51;"It's like somebody at the office just said to her,"
22:51;22:53;"you know, those things will kill you."
22:53;22:55;"Hey, Gillian, you know those things will kill you."
22:55;22:56;"You know what, Marsha?"
22:56;22:57;"It's delicious."
22:58;23:01;"Doctor, my eyes have seen the years"
23:01;23:05;"and the slow parade of fears without crying."
23:05;23:10;"Now I want to understand."
23:10;23:17;"I have done all that I could to see the evil and the good"
23:17;23:18;"without hiding."
23:18;23:23;"You must help me if you can."
23:23;23:29;"Doctor, my eyes, tell me what it for."
23:29;23:36;"Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?"
23:36;23:47;"As I have wandered through this world,"
23:47;23:51;"and as each moment has unfurled, I've"
23:51;23:57;"been waiting to awaken from these dreams."
23:57;24:00;"People go just where they will."
24:00;24:05;"I never noticed them until I got this feeling"
24:05;24:09;"that it's later than it seems."
24:09;24:15;"Doctor, my eyes, tell me what you see."
24:15;24:21;"I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me."

24:35;24:38;"If you want to run a marathon, I mean, that sounds super hard,"
24:38;24:40;"but OK."
24:40;24:42;"Also, the character that she's playing in this,"
24:42;24:44;"I don't think she's comparing drinking Diet Coke to living"
24:44;24:46;"in a yurt or running a marathon."
24:46;24:47;"By pointing out those two things,"
24:47;24:48;"she's like, you want to live in a yurt?"
24:48;24:49;"You're some kind of hippie?"
24:49;24:50;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
24:50;24:51;"Trying to get back to the Earth?"
24:51;24:52;"Well, go do you."
24:52;24:53;"I drink toxic waste."
24:53;24:54;"That's what I do."
24:54;24:55;"Oh, you want to go run a marathon?"
24:55;24:57;"You want to actually be healthy?"
24:57;24:59;"OK, do you, but that sounds really hard."
24:59;25:01;"You're selling a product called Diet Coke."
25:01;25:02;"It's supposed to be like a healthy choice."
25:02;25:04;"I'm going to sit at my desk all day"
25:04;25:06;"and then walk 300 feet to Mike Prius,"
25:06;25:09;"and then drive home in traffic sipping my Diet Coke."
25:09;25:11;"Forget the yurt, OK?"
25:11;25:12;"I'm a weird--"

25:21;25:23;"I don't like to be in yurts."
25:23;25:24;"I like the comfort of my home."

25:25;25:28;"I'm not a health nut who tries to push my body to the limit"
25:28;25:29;"to-- no."
25:29;25:33;"I like to drink this weird, silvery, toxic drink."
25:33;25:36;"If you want to run a marathon, I mean, that sounds super hard,"
25:36;25:38;"but OK."
25:38;25:42;"I mean, just do you, whatever that is."
25:42;25:45;"And if you're in the mood for a Diet Coke, have a Diet Coke."
25:45;25:47;"That's just straight up old school advertising."
25:47;25:49;"Just like, just do it."
25:49;25:50;"It's fun."
25:50;25:51;"I know, but doesn't the tone of it--"
25:51;25:53;"this just makes me think of some early Mad Men,"
25:53;25:55;"where they're like, everybody knows"
25:55;25:56;"that cigarettes cause cancer."
25:56;25:57;"Now how do we sell it?"
25:57;26:00;"And Don Draper's just like, we tell them"
26:00;26:05;"that smoking cigarettes is your last stand as a human being."
26:05;26:07;"Yeah, we're all going to die, but you're"
26:07;26:10;"going to do it in a way that makes you feel good."
26:10;26:13;"Because smoking is American."
26:13;26:14;"It's liberty."
26:14;26:15;"You know what I mean?"
26:15;26:16;"It's like this weird way."
26:16;26:17;"And it's like funny that Diet Coke is just"
26:17;26:19;"fully on the ropes now."
26:19;26:22;"And they're just like, the best way we can sell Diet Coke"
26:22;26:25;"is by telling people, like, I know it's weird."
26:25;26:28;"I know a lot of people don't drink Diet Coke anymore."
26:28;26:29;"You're making an idiosyncratic choice."
26:29;26:32;"You like that metallic taste."
26:32;26:33;"People call it weird."
26:33;26:34;"You know what I think is weird?"
26:34;26:36;"I think health nuts who run marathons is weird."
26:36;26:38;"They're the real weirdos."
26:38;26:43;"I think people who drink water all day are weird."
26:43;26:45;"So you think drinking Diet Coke is weird?"
26:45;26:46;"Well, we're all weird."

26:48;26:50;"Yeah, that's weird."
26:50;26:51;"Life is meaningless, OK?"
26:51;26:54;"You're not better than me."
26:54;26:56;"Diet Coke, because I can."
26:56;26:57;"Because I can."
26:57;26:58;"Because I can."
26:58;27:01;"[vocalizing]"
27:01;27:03;"Some feel good music behind."
27:03;27:06;"Diet Coke, because I can."
27:06;27:07;"It's so nihilistic."
27:07;27:08;"[music - ""wake up""]"
27:08;27:09;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
27:09;27:10;"I feel like I'm dead."
27:10;27:12;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
27:12;27:14;"I feel like I'm dead."
27:14;27:15;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
27:15;27:17;"I feel like I'm dead."
27:17;27:18;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
27:18;27:19;"I feel like I'm dead."
27:19;27:20;"Ay, ay."
27:20;27:22;"I put the game up."
27:22;27:24;"I just the game up."
27:24;27:25;"We do not play, bruh."
27:25;27:27;"In my own lane, bruh."
27:27;27:28;"Never in the lane, bruh."
27:28;27:30;"You know you was in the lane."
27:30;27:31;"Mob shitting up the stage."
27:31;27:33;"She gon' come down the stage."
27:33;27:34;"What you mean?"
27:35;27:36;"What you mean?"
27:36;27:37;"What you mean?"
27:37;27:38;"What you mean?"
27:38;27:39;"What you mean?"
27:39;27:39;"Yeah."
27:39;27:40;"That's OK."
27:40;27:41;"That's OK."
27:41;27:42;"That's OK."
27:42;27:43;"Yeah."
27:43;27:44;"That's OK."
27:45;27:46;"Yeah."
27:46;27:47;"What you mean?"
27:47;27:48;"Yeah."
27:48;27:49;"What you mean?"
27:49;27:49;"Yeah."
27:49;27:50;"What you mean?"
27:50;27:51;"Yeah."
27:51;27:52;"What you mean?"
27:52;27:53;"That's OK."
27:57;27:59;"Like, when I wake up, I go up."
27:59;28:00;"I feel like I'm dead."
28:00;28:02;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
28:02;28:04;"I feel like I'm dead."
28:04;28:05;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
28:06;28:07;"I feel like I'm dead."
28:07;28:08;"Ay, I wake up, I go up."
28:08;28:10;"I feel like I'm dead."
28:10;28:14;"Ay, pink roses, pink name, pink bodies, pink beams,"
28:14;28:15;"pretty foreign, but clean."
28:15;28:17;"Where is this be?"
28:17;28:18;"Zan up, I'm next."
28:18;28:21;"You know I'm next, yo."
28:21;28:23;"One sex, yo."
28:23;28:25;"Part of the reason that Diet Coke, I think,"
28:25;28:26;"is going big right now is because they"
28:26;28:29;"are semi-relaunching the brand."
28:29;28:30;"Are you aware of this, Jake?"
28:30;28:31;"Nope."
28:31;28:33;"So I think Diet Coke has hit kind of hard times."
28:33;28:34;"Diet Coke is such a--"
28:34;28:35;"Post-Trump, dude."
28:35;28:36;"Yeah, maybe it is post-Trump."
28:36;28:40;"So Diet Coke introduced four new fruit-flavored versions"
28:40;28:43;"this week in an effort to entice former soda drinkers"
28:43;28:46;"and La Croix guzzling seltzer lovers."
28:46;28:49;"So you've probably been seeing a lot of the La Croix"
28:49;28:50;"seltzer everywhere."
28:50;28:51;"Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with La Croix."
28:51;28:54;"So now people are going for that because they"
28:54;28:55;"taught a whole generation, like, you"
28:55;28:57;"don't need Coke or Diet Coke."
28:57;28:58;"You know, just keep it light."
28:58;29:00;"It's actually just the carbonation."
29:00;29:01;"Right."
29:01;29:04;"It's like 80% of the pleasure of drinking soda."
29:04;29:06;"So they're like, yeah, just have like a very lightly"
29:06;29:08;"flavored, weird little seltzer beverage."
29:08;29:09;"Yeah."
29:09;29:10;"And Coke is like, well, we need to--"
29:10;29:12;"are we losing because we don't have enough variety?"
29:12;29:16;"So they introduced some new flavors of Diet Coke--"
29:16;29:20;"feisty cherry, twisted mango, ginger lime,"
29:20;29:22;"and zesty blood orange."
29:22;29:23;"When do you think they started--"
29:23;29:26;"these companies started calling [bleep] twisted?"
29:26;29:28;"That's like very '90s."
29:28;29:32;"This stuff will all be off the market in 18 months."
29:32;29:33;"Not going to sell."
29:33;29:36;"According to Beverage Digest--"
29:36;29:37;"Nice."
29:37;29:39;"--while Diet Coke is still the second most popular soda"
29:39;29:40;"in the US, Coke tops the list."
29:40;29:43;"Sales of the drink have fallen every year since 2006."
29:43;29:47;"One analyst calls this rebranding a moment of panic."
29:47;29:48;"For sure."
29:48;29:50;"Everything that people wanted out of Diet Coke up till, say,"
29:50;29:53;"2000, 2005 has essentially just been outsourced"
29:53;29:55;"to other beverages that seem to be doing the same thing"
29:55;29:57;"better, he says, in reference to the hydration, energy,"
29:57;29:59;"and fizzy aspects of soda drinks."
29:59;30:01;"Exactly."
30:01;30:04;"And the old arguments they used to make for it don't fly anymore,"
30:04;30:06;"hence the bizarre commercials."
30:06;30:08;"You know, sodas are just like anything in culture."
30:08;30:10;"They're going to run their course, right?"
30:10;30:11;"Yeah."
30:11;30:12;"You can't sustain that."
30:12;30:13;"They had their run."
30:13;30:14;"New generations want new things."
30:14;30:16;"Coke should just buy LaCroix."
30:16;30:17;"That's it."
30:17;30:20;"LaCroix is like the hip new thing that's got organic--"
30:20;30:22;"Or start, like, a streaming service or something."
30:22;30:25;"Maybe launch a cryptocurrency."
30:25;30:26;"But listen, this is what--"
30:26;30:27;"Crypto has just been crashing."
30:27;30:29;"Oh, yeah, crypto's [bleep] up."
30:29;30:32;"Now's the perfect time for Coke to go by."
30:32;30:34;"This is what Coca-Cola, North America's group director"
30:34;30:36;"for Diet Coke, said in a statement."
30:36;30:38;"""We're modernizing what has made Diet Coke so special"
30:38;30:40;"for a new generation."
30:40;30:42;"Millennials are now thirstier than ever for adventures"
30:42;30:43;"and new experiences."""
30:43;30:44;"Oh, my god."
30:44;30:46;"""And we want to be right by their side."""
30:46;30:47;"That's brutal."
30:47;30:50;"See, again, take a page from your own ad."
30:50;30:51;"Just like knowing it."
30:51;30:55;"If you were in that position of that guy, that spokesman,"
30:55;30:56;"this was your gig."
30:56;30:57;"Yeah."
30:57;31:00;"If you were to vet everything through the higher ups,"
31:00;31:01;"what would you say?"
31:01;31:02;"They're like, OK, Ezra--"
31:02;31:04;"If you're just going to mask off?"
31:04;31:05;"Mask off."
31:05;31:08;"And they're like, Ezra, yo, we're launching these four new"
31:08;31:11;"juice spin-offs of Diet Coke."
31:11;31:12;"Just spin it."
31:12;31:13;"Can you sell it?"
31:13;31:15;"Here's what my pitch, my Don Draper pitch,"
31:15;31:16;"for how to sell."
31:16;31:20;"Maybe it's not that different than the Gillian Jacobs ad."
31:20;31:23;"But I'd be like, compared to all these new school,"
31:23;31:26;"naturally zero calorie things, like these new waters"
31:26;31:29;"and seltzers and these kids who like to drink smoothies"
31:29;31:31;"and eat acai bowls and all this--"
31:31;31:32;"And that's all good."
31:32;31:34;"That's all cool."
31:34;31:34;"But--"
31:34;31:35;"Acai bowls."
31:35;31:37;"So what is Diet Coke then?"
31:37;31:39;"Diet Coke no longer represents health."
31:39;31:42;"I'd be like, so rather than try to get all these new flares,"
31:42;31:44;"I'd just be like, what does Diet Coke look like?"
31:44;31:45;"It's silver."
31:45;31:47;"It's like a robot."
31:47;31:49;"I would almost market it like the way"
31:49;31:52;"that Mountain Dew markets it as like an energy fuel"
31:52;31:53;"for gamers."
31:53;31:53;"Right."
31:53;31:54;"It's just like--"
31:54;31:56;"Or it's like T2."
31:56;31:57;"Yeah, it's just like--"
31:57;32:00;"It's like, listen, we know you're not in good shape."
32:00;32:03;"You're sitting in a chair playing video games all day."
32:03;32:04;"We're literally toxic fuel."
32:04;32:06;"And we're not even going to hide it."
32:06;32:08;"We're introducing Mountain Dew Code Red,"
32:08;32:10;"the most like unnatural red color."
32:10;32:11;"Chug it down."
32:11;32:14;"You're half man, half machine."
32:14;32:15;"You've sacrificed."
32:15;32:17;"You're no longer a meat puppet."
32:17;32:19;"I'd do the same thing for Diet Coke, just be like--"
32:19;32:20;"Meat puppet."
32:20;32:21;"You're a millennial."
32:21;32:24;"You know better than anybody that life is meaningless."
32:24;32:27;"You're watching like America get torn apart."
32:27;32:29;"And yeah, a lot of your peers are"
32:29;32:33;"into some feel good, hippie dippy beverages, but not you."
32:33;32:35;"You see the world as it is."
32:35;32:36;"Take the red pill."
33:00;33:05;"It's time for Jake's takes on time crisis."
33:05;33:06;"OK, yeah."
33:06;33:08;"Rebrand as DC."
33:08;33:10;"And you do a tie in with DC Comics."
33:10;33:11;"Oh, yeah."
33:11;33:13;"And so it's like weird like superhero food."
33:13;33:15;"Right."
33:15;33:16;"You're just like--"
33:16;33:17;"Yeah."
33:17;33:20;"Just like DC, but in the sort of like fake Superman."
33:20;33:23;"Or like-- no, even like the DC Comics logo."
33:23;33:24;"Yeah."
33:24;33:25;"Just put that on the can."
33:25;33:26;"Right."
33:26;33:28;"You just remove it from the original beverage."
33:28;33:29;"You are not--"
33:29;33:30;"It's the same soda."
33:30;33:31;"You are not a human being."
33:31;33:34;"[laughter]"
33:34;33:38;"You grew up in an era with an iPad in your hand."
33:38;33:39;"You're a millennial."
33:39;33:41;"Your brain is going to be uploaded to the cloud."
33:41;33:42;"Yeah, you're a post-millennial."
33:42;33:43;"Before too long."
33:43;33:44;"You're a post-millennial."
33:44;33:45;"You're not a human being."
33:45;33:48;"You were born with an iPad in your hand."
33:48;33:50;"Your brain will be uploaded to the cloud."
33:50;33:53;"When you watch Black Mirror, you laugh"
33:53;33:55;"because it's too optimistic."
33:55;33:56;"Softcore."
33:56;33:57;"It's softcore."
33:57;33:59;"Black Mirror means nothing to you."
33:59;34:02;"Oh, it's like-- you're beyond Black Mirror."
34:02;34:03;"You're Silver Mirror."
34:03;34:05;"The Silver Mirror is Diet Coke."
34:05;34:06;"DC."
34:06;34:07;"DC."
34:07;34:07;"It's not diet."
34:08;34:08;"It's not Coke."
34:08;34:10;"It's DC."
34:10;34:12;"You're chugging internet juice."
34:12;34:13;"Fuel."
34:13;34:17;"Old-- Diet Coke is internet juice."
34:17;34:19;"DC."
34:19;34:22;"Your meat puppet friends and colleagues drink coffee."
34:22;34:25;"Coffee comes from beans grown in the soil, not you."
34:25;34:28;"You're plugging right into the mainframe."
34:28;34:30;"Let your body deteriorate."
34:30;34:32;"Yeah, it's almost like you look at these other people--"
34:32;34:33;"and that's what the ad was saying."
34:33;34:37;"You look at your cousin running a marathon."
34:37;34:40;"You look at your friend having a baby."
34:40;34:42;"You look at your brother spending pointless hours"
34:42;34:45;"in the gym, moving weights up and down."
34:45;34:46;"As he ages."
34:46;34:47;"As he ages."
34:47;34:48;"And graze."
34:48;34:49;"You can't stop the train, bro."
34:49;34:51;"That six pack?"
34:51;34:53;"It's going to be nothing when you're just a skeleton."
34:53;34:55;"You drink Diet Coke."
34:55;34:57;"Black tar nectar that is the runoff"
34:57;35:01;"of the servers in China mining the next bitcoins."
35:01;35:03;"God is dead."
35:03;35:04;"Whew."
35:04;35:05;"Jeez Louise."
35:05;35:08;"Diet Coke is some intense [bleep] man."
35:08;35:12;"Yeah, Diet Coke used to be associated with like models."
35:12;35:14;"It kind of represented this type of like New York"
35:14;35:15;"or like London cool."
35:15;35:17;"It's like somebody smokes cigarettes and drinks Diet"
35:17;35:18;"Coke."
35:18;35:20;"Now it's like way darker than that."
35:20;35:22;"Darker and banal."
35:22;35:22;"I love that."
35:22;35:24;"Tied Diet Coke in a cryptocurrency."
35:24;35:28;"Yeah, tied to crypto, tied to DC Comics."
35:28;35:33;"Just every sort of pathetic adolescent urge."
35:33;35:35;"Man-child urge."
35:35;35:36;"Death is inevitable."
35:36;35:37;"Drink Diet Coke."
35:37;35:38;"That's your pitch."
35:38;35:39;"That's your Draper-esque pitch."
35:40;35:43;"I don't really care if you cry."
35:43;35:46;"All the real, you shouldn't have a lie."
35:46;35:49;"Should have saw the way she looked me in my eyes."
35:49;35:53;"She said, baby, I am not afraid to die."
35:53;35:54;"Push me to the edge."
35:54;35:56;"All my friends are dead."
35:56;35:57;"Push me to the edge."
35:57;35:59;"All my friends are dead."
35:59;36:00;"Push me to the edge."
36:00;36:02;"All my friends are dead."
36:02;36:03;"Push me to the edge."
36:03;36:05;"Phantom that's already."
36:05;36:06;"Inside all white."
36:06;36:08;"That's how they would rather say."
36:08;36:10;"I do want that."
36:10;36:12;"I really, I'm mad."
36:12;36:13;"I really, I'm mad now."
36:13;36:15;"Everybody got the same swag now."
36:15;36:16;"Watch the way I tear down."
36:16;36:18;"Stacking my bands all the way to the top."
36:18;36:19;"All the way to it, be falling, yo."
36:19;36:21;"Every time that you leave your spot,"
36:21;36:22;"your girlfriend call me like, come on, yo."
36:22;36:23;"I like the way that she treat me."
36:23;36:24;"Gonna leave, you won't leave me."
36:24;36:25;"I call it the Casanova."
36:25;36:27;"She say I'm insane."
36:27;36:30;"Yeah, I want to run away."
36:30;36:32;"Give me up the pain."
36:32;36:35;"Please, make it go away."
36:35;36:36;"I'm committed, not addicted."
36:36;36:38;"But it keep controlling me."
36:38;36:40;"Out of pain, I can feel it."
36:40;36:41;"I swear that it's slowing me."
36:41;36:42;"Yeah."
36:42;36:45;"I don't really care if you cry."
36:45;36:48;"Honorary, should have never lied."
36:48;36:55;"So when she look me in my eyes, she said, I am not afraid to die."
36:55;36:56;"All my friends are dead."
36:56;36:58;"Push me to the edge."
36:58;37:00;"All my friends are dead."
37:00;37:01;"Yeah."
37:01;37:02;"Push me to the edge."
37:02;37:04;"All my friends are dead."
37:06;37:08;"Daddy, not your swag."
37:08;37:10;"I swear you fake, girl."
37:10;37:12;"Y'all ain't-- I don't want to take my kid, no."
37:12;37:14;"Yo, red on, Palestine."
37:14;37:15;"Red on."
37:15;37:17;"Yo, medicine."
37:17;37:18;"Look, Jenson."
37:18;37:19;"Hey, yeah."
37:19;37:21;"Fast car, nice car."
37:21;37:22;"Red zone."
37:22;37:25;"In the club, they got no ones that we will back down."
37:25;37:26;"Yo."
37:26;37:29;"Clubs from overseas got the racks and they all see."
37:29;37:30;"No, to you, it's not a cheat."
37:30;37:33;"Yo, look at that, you're stacking up your money."
37:33;37:34;"Here, I'm free."
37:34;37:36;"Yo, I was counting now that it's all 20s."
37:36;37:37;"That's a G, bro."
37:37;37:39;"She say, you're the worst."
37:39;37:41;"You're the worst."
37:41;37:42;"I cannot die."
37:42;37:44;"This my universe."
37:44;37:48;"I don't really care if you cry."
37:48;37:50;"I'm the real, you shouldn't have a lie."
37:50;37:53;"Should have saw the way she looked me in my eye."
37:53;37:57;"She said, baby, I am not afraid to die."
37:57;37:58;"Push me to the edge."
37:58;38:00;"All my friends are dead."
38:00;38:01;"Push me to the edge."
38:01;38:03;"All my friends are dead."
38:03;38:04;"Push me to the edge."
38:04;38:06;"All my friends are dead."
38:06;38:08;"Push me to the edge."
38:08;38:11;"All right, Jake, how about a little dip into the TC mailbag?"
38:11;38:14;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
38:14;38:17;"This one comes from Sam."
38:17;38:21;"Pretty cool email address, techno prayer."
38:21;38:23;"But don't say the at."
38:23;38:24;"Yeah, I won't say the at."
38:24;38:26;"The at's pretty obscure."
38:26;38:28;"Howdy, time crisis."
38:28;38:29;"Hi, Jake."
38:29;38:33;"Our birthday, 2377, is coming up soon."
38:33;38:34;"I think the number one--"
38:34;38:35;"Exact same age."
38:35;38:37;"Yeah, so we were born the exact same day."
38:37;38:38;"Whoa."
38:38;38:43;"I think the number one song that day was Car Wash by Rose Royce."
38:43;38:44;"Great song."
38:44;38:48;"I don't think that really fits into the tasteful palate of '70s rock too bad."
38:48;38:50;"Side note, this week's playlist--"
38:50;38:51;"Yeah."
38:51;38:52;"Tasteful palate."
38:52;38:57;"It's the tasteful palate of '70s disco, which for the lovers of the '70s tasteful palate,"
38:57;38:59;"you got to drop the rock versus disco thing."
38:59;39:00;"Oh, yeah."
39:00;39:01;"Beggars can't be choosers."
39:01;39:03;"You got to take that tasteful palate wherever you can get it, man."
39:03;39:05;"And then you get your BG split in the diff."
39:05;39:06;"Yeah."
39:06;39:10;"Please ask Ezra to give us news on Neo Yokio."
39:10;39:12;"I want to know if there will be a second season."
39:12;39:15;"If there won't, can we at least hear what would have been?"
39:15;39:17;"Neo news coming soon, man."
39:17;39:20;"All I'll say is that Neo's not dead."
39:20;39:24;"I'm writing this from a Home Depot parking lot, and I'm heading to a Tim Hortons now."
39:24;39:25;"I'm in Maine."
39:25;39:26;"I love that."
39:26;39:27;"That's sick."
39:27;39:28;"I don't know."
39:28;39:30;"I mean, I find that hard to believe, but maybe--"
39:30;39:31;"I don't think it's hard to believe."
39:31;39:34;"Maybe pull into the-- you know, pulled into the Depot lot,"
39:34;39:38;"heard some classic rock on the radio, and I was like, ooh, thought of Time Crisis."
39:38;39:39;"Yep."
39:39;39:40;"Drafted the email."
39:40;39:41;"And then thought of Tim Hortons."
39:41;39:42;"It was like, I'm going to go--"
39:42;39:43;"Yeah, there's a Tim."
39:43;39:44;"There's a Timmies down the road."
39:44;39:45;"Yeah."
39:45;39:50;"Oh, and I've been following Seinfeld on Twitter and IG even before I got into TC way back."
39:50;39:55;"Put all those pieces together, along with being an OCBD-wearing VW fan,"
39:55;39:59;"and you can see how TC has become the epicenter of my universe."
39:59;40:00;"Peace, Sam."
40:00;40:02;"What's OCBD?"
40:02;40:03;"I don't know."
40:03;40:06;"Along with being an OCBD-wearing VW fan."
40:06;40:07;"Original--"
40:07;40:09;"Oxford cloth button-down shirt."
40:09;40:10;"Oh, OK."
40:10;40:12;"Oh, I've never seen it abbreviated like that."
40:12;40:13;"That's tight."
40:13;40:16;"That's like some early Vampire Weekend style."
40:16;40:17;"Sick."
40:17;40:18;"Peace, Sam."
40:18;40:19;"Nice little note."
40:19;40:22;"[laughter]"
40:22;40:24;"No questions really me asked about Neo."
40:24;40:26;"Nice little note."
40:26;40:27;"So yeah, it's interesting."
40:27;40:28;"He references the Tasteful Palate."
40:28;40:30;"So Jake, you made a Tasteful Palate playlist?"
40:30;40:31;"I did."
40:31;40:36;"You're listening to the Tasteful Palates of the 1970s on Time Crisis."
40:36;40:37;"See, that's funny."
40:37;40:41;"On this show, certain things just become part of the TC lexicon."
40:41;40:42;"Right."
40:42;40:46;"And sometimes, you know, for the newer listeners, I feel bad."
40:46;40:47;"Like, we got to backtrack a little bit."
40:47;40:48;"Right."
40:48;40:52;"Maybe they don't want to sit through 120 hours of TC."
40:52;40:55;"So you might hear us say Tasteful Palate a lot on the show."
40:55;40:58;"And I know some of the old TC heads are like, they know exactly what we're talking about."
40:58;41:05;"But it all came from Jake's preference for the way that '70s music sounds."
41:05;41:06;"Yeah."
41:06;41:08;"Jake loves the Tasteful Palate."
41:08;41:09;"Of '70s rock."
41:09;41:11;"Of '70s rock."
41:11;41:19;"And I guess you use the phrase Tasteful Palate because it's not about any one color on the spectrum of this."
41:19;41:21;"It's like you enjoy the whole picture."
41:21;41:22;"Yeah."
41:22;41:23;"The whole painting."
41:23;41:24;"It's a really warm painting."
41:24;41:26;"That's what '70s music sounds like."
41:26;41:27;"It's very warm."
41:27;41:29;"And it's not just rock. Let's keep it real."
41:29;41:30;"Yeah."
41:30;41:31;"R&B, soul, funk, disco."
41:31;41:35;"Oh, sure. No. All that stuff sounds amazing from that era."
41:35;41:36;"You like the analog sounds."
41:36;41:43;"I feel like the high water point of recording was like 1972."
41:43;41:47;"Because in the '60s, it was good, but it was kind of like they were still working out the kinks."
41:47;41:48;"It was all four tracks."
41:48;41:50;"It was kind of garagey, a little noisy."
41:50;42:01;"And then it got to the point of very refined equipment and high levels of professionalism with the engineering in the studio circa '72."
42:01;42:05;"And then after that, it started to get too professional in my view."
42:05;42:06;"Oh, okay."
42:06;42:09;"And a little cold and a little mechanical."
42:09;42:12;"So for me, the sweet spot is '72."
42:12;42:14;"So you think late '70s got too pro?"
42:14;42:20;"Yeah. I didn't put any Tom Petty or Fleetwood Mac on the Tasteful Palate playlist because it's a little pro."
42:20;42:21;"This is a major..."
42:21;42:22;"It's a little cold."
42:22;42:25;"This is a major announcement for TC heads."
42:25;42:30;"I'm not saying that that music in the grand scheme of things isn't Tasteful Palate."
42:30;42:32;"But I wanted to kind of..."
42:32;42:35;"I would almost make the case that for me, the late '70s is the high water mark."
42:35;42:37;"But I know what you mean."
42:37;42:45;"Because the late '70s was the most technical, proficient, professional usage of tape."
42:45;42:46;"Yeah."
42:46;42:48;"And it was before..."
42:48;42:51;"The earliest digital albums are from the late '70s."
42:51;42:57;"And it's kind of before you got into that '80s palette, which is interesting but kind of harsh of like..."
42:57;42:58;"Yeah."
42:58;42:59;"Crazy drums."
42:59;43:00;"Noise gate on the snare."
43:00;43:09;"Yeah. So to me, the late '70s, if you look at '79, '80, some of the disco and post-disco from that, that's amazing."
43:09;43:10;"But I know what you mean."
43:10;43:12;"You like that it's a little earthier in the early '70s."
43:12;43:16;"So the years of the playlist is 1959 to 2016."
43:16;43:19;"Because we got an email from Curtis."
43:19;43:27;"He goes, ""Hello, Jake. Just wondering what your opinion is on the future of the Tasteful Palate and the direction of this beautiful sound we all know and love."
43:27;43:32;"Like, for example, have you heard or dug the likes of Whitney, Twin Peaks, or Foxygen?"
43:32;43:38;"Do you think this palette will progress or grow in the future, or is it a slow, dying decline?"
43:38;43:40;"Thank you. God bless."""
43:40;43:43;"I think both are true."
43:43;43:53;"Because, you know, from a very technical standpoint, the Tasteful Palate of the 1970s only existed from January 1, 1970 until New Year's Eve, 1979."
43:53;43:54;"Right."
43:54;43:59;"Before or after, as tasteful as the palette may be, it's not '70s, my friend."
43:59;44:01;"Well, I think it's a state of mind."
44:01;44:05;"So on the playlist, I went from 1959 to 2016."
44:05;44:13;"So I put in some proto Tasteful Palate music that anticipates the heights that would be reached in 1972."
44:13;44:17;"And then I put in some music. I skipped, I think, all of the '80s."
44:17;44:18;"Yeah."
44:18;44:20;"And maybe there's like one or two songs from the '90s."
44:20;44:31;"And then there's a few songs from 2016, like Whitney, and maybe one from 2014 by Foxygen, which I feel like pretty credibly tap into that vibe."
44:31;44:32;"Yeah."
44:32;44:36;"Double-edged sword with Tasteful, though, because Tasteful can also just be..."
44:36;44:37;"Boring."
44:37;44:44;"Exactly. One step away from innocuous and inoffensive. You know, like the guy just playing the coffee shot, you know, like..."
44:44;44:45;"Like Ed Sheeran."
44:45;44:47;"Yeah. Ed Sheeran is tasteful."
44:47;44:55;"We love Ed Sheeran on Time Crisis. But, Jake, you, maybe me more than you, you're not going to put Ed Sheeran on your Tasteful Palate playlist."
44:55;44:56;"No."
44:56;45:02;"Even though he's got heartfelt lyrics, yearning vocals, acoustic guitar."
45:02;45:05;"Yeah, no, the sincerities aren't the issue with Ed. He's very sincere."
45:05;45:07;"In other words, the instrumentation."
45:07;45:13;"Yeah. I mean, I think it's getting to that thing of it's a little too pro. Like, so this playlist..."
45:13;45:14;"So you find it cold."
45:14;45:17;"So this playlist is like, it's like really well done music."
45:17;45:18;"Yeah."
45:18;45:22;"But there's a little bit of like edge to it still. Like the mildest edge."
45:22;45:31;"Put on Rod Stewart, Maggie Mae. This may be, for me, it's not my favorite song in the world, but it maybe is my favorite recording."
45:31;45:34;"It is the platonic ideal of a recording."
45:34;45:35;"So this is on the playlist?"
45:35;45:44;"Yeah. I know I didn't put any like Zeppelin or Stones or Beatles on here because that stuff is so singular and iconic."
45:44;45:45;"Yeah."
45:45;45:54;"I feel like if I did a lot of Tasteful music, it's like too performative and like iconic to be on the Tasteful Palette playlist for me."
45:54;45:55;"Right."
45:55;45:56;"You know what I mean? It's like..."
45:56;45:57;"I hear you."
45:57;45:59;"It's like too edgy."
45:59;46:05;"You're listening to the Tasteful Palettes of the 1970s on Time Crisis."
46:05;46:06;"Right here."
46:06;46:10;"Forgot about that long intro on Maggie Mae."
46:14;46:15;"That 12 string."
46:15;46:16;"Mm-hmm."
46:16;46:18;"Mandolin, bass."
46:18;46:28;"I love that drum sound."
46:28;46:30;"Yeah. Hardpan drums."
46:30;46:32;"Just like real open hi-hat."
46:32;46:36;"If anybody's listening in headphones, listen to how pushed to one side the drums are."
46:36;46:37;"Yeah."
46:37;46:39;"There's like a t-shirt on the snare."
46:43;46:45;"That warm organ."
46:45;46:56;"You know what's funny? People that have known me a long time like associate this song with me."
46:56;46:57;"Really?"
46:57;47:01;"Like old friends of mine are like, ""Oh yeah, I heard Maggie Mae the other day. Totally thought of you."""
47:01;47:02;"Nice."
47:03;47:10;"The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age"
47:10;47:17;"Girl, that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything"
47:17;47:22;"I laughed at all of your jokes"
47:22;47:26;"My love you didn't need to coax"
47:26;47:32;"Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore"
47:33;47:36;"You led me away from home"
47:36;47:40;"Just to save you from being alone"
47:40;47:45;"You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without"
47:45;47:54;"All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand"
47:54;47:58;"But you turned into a lover and mother"
47:59;48:02;"The one I love you wore me out"
48:02;48:06;"All you did was wreck my bed"
48:06;48:10;"And in the morning kicked me in the head"
48:10;48:16;"Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore"
48:16;48:21;"You led me away from home"
48:21;48:25;"'Cause you didn't want to be alone"
48:26;48:30;"You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried"
48:30;48:53;"I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school"
48:54;49:00;"I'll steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing fool"
49:00;49:09;"I'll find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand"
49:09;49:15;"Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face"
49:15;49:20;"You made a first class fool out of me"
49:20;49:24;"But I was blind as a fork and a nail"
49:24;49:30;"You stole my heart, but I loved ya anyway"
49:31;49:34;"You know what I like about this song too?"
49:34;49:40;"It's rootsy without being all like, ""Look at me, I'm old timey."""
49:40;49:44;"These are all super old timey instruments."
49:44;49:46;"It's fresh."
49:46;49:48;"That's what I tried to do with this playlist."
49:48;49:51;"If you're overly self-conscious about being tasteful,"
49:51;49:55;"then it's not fun and it's not really tasteful."
49:55;49:58;"It's like swing. If you gotta ask what it is, you'll never know."
49:58;50:01;"Right. Then you're just being safe and sort of cautious."
50:01;50:03;"Well, it's kind of like Diet Coke."
50:03;50:08;"If you're not tasteful, just chug Diet Coke and listen to whatever you want."
50:08;50:09;"Chain smokers."
50:09;50:10;"Yeah, why not?"
50:10;50:12;"No, I think that's a really good point."
50:12;50:14;"Chain smoke listening to chain smokers."
50:14;50:16;"Chain chugging DC."
50:16;50:18;"A sixer of DC."
50:18;50:20;"Yeah, and also like you said, the word tasteful,"
50:20;50:27;"it is a problematic word because it implies that other things are less than."
50:27;50:30;"Well, and there's amazing music that is not tasteful."
50:30;50:33;"I'm not saying that it has to be tasteful."
50:33;50:38;"This is just a specific sort of vein that we touch on in this show a lot."
50:38;50:42;"And it's hard to put your thumb on it, which is why I wanted to make the playlist."
50:42;50:44;"So I'm excited to check this out."
50:44;50:50;"So everybody go to the Time Crisis page and check out Jake's Tasteful Palette playlist."
50:50;50:53;"A concept that's been bandied about quite a bit on this show."
50:53;50:55;"Now you finally get to see what he's talking about."
50:55;50:57;"1959 to 2016."
50:57;50:59;"We're spanning some years here, folks."
50:59;51:02;"There's a narrow view of the 1970s."
51:02;51:03;"This is Jake's--"
51:03;51:04;"This is a holistic view."
51:04;51:07;"This is Jake's longer view of the '70s."
51:07;51:10;"That'd be an interesting opening to your book."
51:10;51:15;"Jake just writes like a 1,000 page treatise on Tasteful Palette."
51:15;51:21;"Opening line, ""The 1970s began in 1959 and ended in 2016."
51:21;51:27;"Over the course of the next 1,000 pages, I intend to prove this audacious hypothesis."""

54:00;54:02;"Hey Jake, you hear about Lady Doritos?"
54:02;54:04;"Heard about it. Hard to avoid that."
54:04;54:07;"So again, classic TC."
54:07;54:08;"Way behind the curve."
54:08;54:09;"Way behind."
54:09;54:15;"There was one day on Twitter when the world exploded with the concept of Lady Doritos."
54:15;54:19;"And we got an interesting email about it asking us to get on the case."
54:19;54:22;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
54:22;54:26;"So this is from Heather in Tacoma."
54:26;54:30;"She says, ""Dear Jake, sorry not sorry for writing to Time Crisis on your personal email."
54:30;54:35;"However, as I expect you will address the controversy surrounding the so-called female-friendly Doritos on this week's episode,"
54:35;54:39;"I'm writing to share some grave concerns regarding the media's coverage of this issue."
54:39;54:42;"Although Time Crisis is my main source of news..."""
54:42;54:44;"See? That's what we've been saying."
54:44;54:50;"""...and I therefore cannot claim to be fully up to speed on this story, TC listeners not reading a lot of news,"
54:50;54:55;"it has come to my attention that the outrage around Lady Doritos was sparked by a right-wing media article"
54:55;54:59;"that took the words of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi out of context."
54:59;55:03;"For now, I hope we can set aside the debate regarding the merits of a crunchless chip"
55:03;55:05;"that doesn't leave your fingers coated in powder."
55:05;55:11;"What concerns me is the way that right-wing/corporate America benefits by baiting our collective appetite for outrage."
55:11;55:14;"We know that products such as KFC's Extra Crispy Sunscreen..."""
55:14;55:16;"What?"
55:16;55:17;"I don't know."
55:17;55:21;"""...or the Double Down Sandwich, which uses two pieces of fried chicken for a bun..."""
55:21;55:22;"I remember that one."
55:22;55:26;"""...were engineered solely to provoke outrage and thus create free publicity for the brand."""
55:26;55:28;"You know, all news is good news."
55:28;55:30;"So if you're running KFC or something..."
55:30;55:32;"Yeah, we're making sunscreen now."
55:32;55:34;"Yeah. Oh my god."
55:34;55:43;"Next thing you know, you're getting covered in everything from The Fader to some fake news, Patriot Games, .net."
55:43;55:52;"""I believe this ties in with some of the reservations Ezra has raised on past episodes of Time Crisis regarding the self-aware persona certain brands of fast food present on social media."
55:52;55:56;"Not only are they in on the joke, but they're trolling their customers just to encourage brand engagement."
55:56;56:01;"I don't believe that Doritos for Her is a case of this intentional manipulation of our collective outrage."
56:01;56:05;"However, I am concerned that reporting by the New York Post and other right-wing media sources"
56:05;56:12;"was intended to rally public opinion around the Doritos status quo in order to stymie change in the snack food industry."""
56:12;56:13;"Wow."
56:13;56:19;"""This is interesting. By casting this call for snacks with a stronger sense of a decorum in regressive gendered terms,"
56:19;56:25;"the right-wing media has dealt a serious blow to progressives working in the processed food arena."
56:25;56:27;"Jesus Christ."
56:27;56:31;"We all deserve a flavored tortilla chip that doesn't leave embarrassing stains on our fingertips."
56:31;56:34;"I hope you will keep this in mind as you address the unfolding story."
56:34;56:37;"Sincerely, Crunchless and Tacoma, aka Heather."""
56:37;56:38;"Wow, Heather thought this through."
56:38;56:42;"I'm not sure if I totally buy it, her theory, but I love the theory."
56:42;56:44;"""Heather sounds like a diet Coke drinker."
56:44;56:48;"She sees the world as a disgusting mess and she's a straight shooter."""
56:48;56:52;"She's worried about the progressives working in the processed food arena."
56:52;56:57;"""So, okay, so we probably have some confused listeners who maybe did not follow."
56:57;57:00;"If you're not glued to the internet, you might not have heard about Lady Doritos"
57:00;57:02;"because these things come and go so quickly."
57:02;57:06;"Generally speaking, when most people hear about a big news topic,"
57:06;57:11;"you're not hearing about the news story, you're hearing about the blowback."
57:11;57:15;"And sometimes even by the time you hear about it, you're hearing about the blowback to the blowback."
57:15;57:20;"So I heard about everybody was like, 'Oh my God, Doritos is trying to make Lady Doritos."
57:20;57:23;"Doritos is going to unveil a type of Doritos for women"
57:23;57:28;"because Doritos thinks that women don't like to get their fingers dirty"
57:28;57:31;"and they don't like to enjoy Doritos the same way men do."
57:31;57:33;"Well, we don't need that bulls**t.'"
57:33;57:35;"That was kind of the general tone of that stuff."""
57:35;57:40;"""It's twofold, right? It's fingers less dirty, but also it crunches less loudly."""
57:40;57:43;"""So I think there's a lot of people saying, 'Look, we live in crazy times."
57:43;57:47;"Got somebody like Donald Trump in office. Women face a lot of challenges."
57:47;57:50;"There's a lot of women working hard to change things in the world"
57:50;57:53;"and you're going to come to us with some bulls**t like Lady Doritos"
57:53;57:56;"and expect us to be happy about it? Like f**k you.'"
57:56;57:57;"That was kind of the vibe."
57:57;58:02;"And to be fair, that is a very condescending idea to say to women like,"
58:02;58:06;"'Hey, listen, you can't really handle our Doritos because you're worried about your fingers."
58:06;58:08;"So here's something just for you.'"""
58:08;58:12;"So we get it almost every night"
58:12;58:15;"And when that moon gets big and bright"
58:15;58:18;"It's a supernatural delight"
58:18;58:23;"Everybody was dancing in the moonlight"
58:23;58:33;"Everybody here is out of sight"
58:33;58:35;"They don't bark and they don't bite"
58:35;58:39;"They keep things loose, they keep things alight"
58:39;58:44;"Everybody was dancing in the moonlight"
58:44;58:46;"Dancing in the moonlight"
58:46;58:50;"Everybody's a dreamer, a woman right"
58:50;58:52;"It's such a fight"
58:52;58:54;"And that's just it"
58:54;58:57;"Everybody's dancing in the moonlight"
58:57;59:00;"We like our fun and we never fight"
59:00;59:03;"You can't dance and stay uptight"
59:03;59:07;"It's a supernatural delight"
59:07;59:12;"Everybody was dancing in the moonlight"
59:12;59:14;"Dancing in the moonlight"
59:14;59:18;"Everybody's a dreamer, a woman right"
59:18;59:20;"It's such a fight"
59:20;59:22;"And that's just it"
59:22;59:26;"Everybody's dancing in the moonlight"
59:26;59:28;"Okay, so what happened?"
59:28;59:31;"So there's like an original context to the whole thing, right?"
59:31;59:33;"Okay, so we're kind of fact-checking Heather a little bit"
59:33;59:35;"I love Heather's kind of conspiracy theory"
59:35;59:39;"So she believes that this is a non-news story, essentially"
59:39;59:41;"Drummed up by the New York Post and right-wing media"
59:41;59:44;"I think maybe she feels like Dorito said something mild"
59:44;59:48;"And then the right-wing media actually took it and ran with it"
59:48;59:50;"So she's saying something pretty complex here"
59:50;59:53;"She's saying that the right-wing media actually had a dog in the fight"
59:53;59:56;"In the fast food arena"
59:56;59:59;"That the right-wing media wants to hamper"
59:59;01:00:03;"Any sort of progressive ideas in junk food"
01:00:03;01:00:07;"Okay, so I think she's saying something very interesting"
01:00:07;01:00:12;"She's saying that the right-wing now knows how to play"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"The left wing like a fiddle"
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Okay"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"Or a violin"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"That's true"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"A cello"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Heather, I'm sorry that you're not here to correct us"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"But my interpretation is that you're saying"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"That there's some good-natured progressives inside PepsiCo"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"Free delay"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"Which is owned by, yeah, yeah"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"Which is owned by, I don't remember"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"Yeah, was it Yum! Brand? No, not anymore"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"Okay, I'm gonna go really, I'm gonna really dumb down Heather's argument"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Because I think this is what she's saying"
01:00:38;01:00:42;"There were a bunch of feminists in the PepsiCo corporation"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Who said, you know what?"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"Our needs as women have been ignored for too long"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"So we believe that there needs to be more consumer choice"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"So that women have a choice"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"Because for too long, male choice has come first"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"Which is true, right?"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"And women, you know, women pay pink tax"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Their products are more expensive"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"So maybe she's saying"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"There's a group of feminists that said"
01:01:04;01:01:07;"Let's unveil different types of Doritos"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"We're not gonna condescend to our sisters"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"By putting in a pink bag"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"Let's just make more types of Doritos"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"So that women have choices too"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"And let's keep it at the same price point"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"So this is a group of well-meaning feminists"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Who just want to expand"
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Okay"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"What Doritos has"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Now the CEO of PepsiCo"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Who's a very impressive woman"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"Indra Nooyi"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"She goes on this podcast"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"And starts talking about it"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"And she starts saying, you know"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"Our research suggests that women are looking for different things in our chips"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"And we're not offering it to them"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"I want to hear it"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"Do we have the clip?"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Yeah, so this is what Indra had to say"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"On the Freakonomics podcast"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Oh, I love Freakonomics"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"I understand that men and women eat chips very differently"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Also, I want to point it out"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Leading the witness"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Stephen J. Dubner"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"Dubner"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"He asked her the question"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"It's funny to his question"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"She didn't come out and say like"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"You know Stephen, thank you for having me"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"I want to talk about something"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Women, they can't handle Doritos"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"So he asked her a question"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"I understand"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Well, I'm sure they did like some prep for the interview"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"And this was like"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"Who knows"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"I understand that men and women eat chips very differently"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"Can you tell us the differences?"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"I think, you know"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"When you eat out of a flex bag"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"You know, one of our single serve bags"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"Especially as you watch a lot of the young guys"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Eat the chips"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"They love their Doritos"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"And you know, they lick their fingers with great glee"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"And when they reach the bottom of the bag"
01:02:33;01:02:38;"They pour the little broken pieces into their mouth"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"Because they don't want to lose that taste of the flavor"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"And the broken chips in the bottom"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"You know, women I think would love to do the same"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"But they don't"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"They don't like to crunch too loudly in public"
01:02:50;01:02:54;"And you know, they don't lick their fingers generously"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"And they don't like to pour the little broken pieces"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"And the flavor into their mouth"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"So is there like a male and female version of chips"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"That you're playing with or no?"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"It's not a male and female as much as"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Okay, right there, very important moment"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Yup, not as, yup"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Dubner, the dubs says"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Answer point blank"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Give it to me straight, Indra"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"Are you about to unveil some pink bag of Doritos"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"That cost $4 more?"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"His and hers"
01:03:20;01:03:23;"So is there like a male and female version of chips"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"That you're playing with or no?"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"It's not a male and female as much as"
01:03:27;01:03:31;"Are there snacks for women that can be"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"Designed and packaged differently"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"And yes, we are looking at it"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"And we're getting ready to launch a bunch of them soon"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"For women, you know, low crunch"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"The full taste profile"
01:03:44;01:03:48;"You know, not have so much of the flavor stick on the fingers"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"And how can you put it in your purse?"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"Because women love to carry a snack in their purse"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"The whole design capability we built in PepsiCo"
01:03:56;01:03:59;"Was to allow design to work with innovation"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"Not just on packaging colors"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"But to go through the entire cycle"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"And say all the way to the product in the pantry"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Or how it's being carried around"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"Or how they eat it in the car or drink it in the car"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"What should be the design of the product"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"The package, the experience"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"So that we can influence the entire chain"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Okay, so here's one way to look at it"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"What the CEO is saying"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"Is that she believes"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"That women are looking for something"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"In the chip category that they're not getting"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"And so when he asks her"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"So are you going to, therefore, like"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"Condescend to them and say here's Lady Doritos"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"She laughs and says no, of course not"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"What we're trying to do"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"Is have a wider array of chips"
01:04:42;01:04:46;"Including ones that would solve the problems"
01:04:46;01:04:50;"That supposedly some women have with Doritos"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Look, I'm not taking sides here"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"But I'm saying I guess if you want it to be charitable"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"You would say that the female CEO of the company"
01:04:57;01:05:01;"Saw a way in which female chip lovers"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"Were being underserved"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"And rather than condescend to them"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"And treat them like children"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"She just wanted to give them something"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"So it almost sounds like they weren't getting ready"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"To roll out a pink bag of Doritos"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"They were getting ready to roll out more types of Doritos"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"So just that when a man or a woman"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Walks into the place"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"There's a choice for people who"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Carry purses and who don't like"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"Dust on their fingers"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"So who knows, maybe Jake"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"You would be part of that psychographic"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I would be"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"And it's weird because you could just"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"Come out with a more chilled out version of Doritos"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"You could come out with like"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"Maybe that was the plan all along"
01:05:36;01:05:39;"And she got in trouble by answering his question"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"His gendered question"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"Or they're thinking"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"Look, we've tried that before"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"We put out the original kind of"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Mellow Doritos in the old bag"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"It doesn't sell"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"People don't care"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"They want to go for the hyper saturated"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Nacho cheese Dorito"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Yeah"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"This time around we're going to release"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"The mellow Dorito"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"But we're going to brand it as feminine"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Because that might sell more"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Well you know what?"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"We'll never know"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Because at this point they're going to react"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"To this firestorm they created"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"We'll never know what the branding was going to look like"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"If the branding was going to be like"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Because there still are products"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Like straight up razors"
01:06:12;01:06:13;"That are marketed towards women"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"They're pink and they're more expensive"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"You can't get more cut and dry than that"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"It's like here women"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"Deodorant"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"This is the color you like"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"This is the color that defines you"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"And we're going to gouge you"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"For all we know they were going to roll out"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Something that was just like chilled Doritos"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"For all we know she was thinking"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"Look, for chilled Doritos"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"It's going to be men and women"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"We're guessing it's going to be about 75% women"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"And 25% kind of just chill out dudes"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"Like maybe that's what she thought"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"But look, the language she used was"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Not helpful"
01:06:42;01:06:48;"If there is ever the impregnable question"
01:06:48;01:06:53;"Of what, what did or didn't pass"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"It would help to seek"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"Comfort in destiny"
01:07:02;01:07:10;"But I really don't, I don't see why"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"But I need you"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"And you're always on my mind"
01:07:16;01:07:24;"Whether there is or isn't"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Any position"
01:07:26;01:07:31;"You care if I take or I don't"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"I will always hold"
01:07:37;01:07:41;"What we shared so long"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"To be the only love"
01:07:44;01:07:48;"And though we don't see eye to eye"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"I need you"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"And you're always on my mind"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"The first place to report it was not"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"A right wing news source"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"It was Salon.com"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"Which I believe is considered"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"Center left, moderate"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"And they had a tone of outrage"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"They said that the PepsiCo CEO"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Revealed that the company would be"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Launching lady snacks"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"So already they're using"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"They're kind of twisting the language"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"A little bit"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"But you know, I'm not dissing them"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"But they, of course"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"She didn't say lady snacks"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"When he suggested that she was going to"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Launch lady snacks"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"She laughed and said not really"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"But was what Salon said"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"Finally allowing women everywhere"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"To eat between meals"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"Just as men have done for centuries"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Were you not aware that crunchy, crunchy chips"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"Were secretly somehow insufficiently feminine"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"More to fool you"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"So Salon was like immediately"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"Just kind of like"
01:08:38;01:08:39;"F*** you, Indra"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"And then the New York Post picked up on it"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"But they weren't particularly"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Using inflammatory language"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"And then the Washington Post wrote something"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Opinion piece"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"That actually it's about the marketing"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"Less than the product itself"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"The argument underlying much of the anger"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Around the mythical lady Doritos"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"Pointedly calling it mythical"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Rests on the idea that women eat Doritos"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Just the same as men"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Thank you very much"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"And suggesting otherwise"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Is all stereotype and no substance"
01:09:02;01:09:05;"Maybe or maybe as any competent company does"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"PepsiCo conducted focus groups"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"To see how men and women ate their snacks"
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Maybe their research showed that men"
01:09:10;01:09:11;"Actually are more comfortable"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Than many women crunching in public"
01:09:13;01:09:14;"Just like they're more comfortable"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Sitting astride a subway seat"
01:09:15;01:09:16;"Like a Colossus"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"Because society has told them they can't"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"In that case PepsiCo isn't developing"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"A product based only on sexism"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"PepsiCo is developing a product"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Based on real life behaviors"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"That are themselves based on sexism"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"So you know that's like a more nuanced take"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Yeah"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"They're basically like"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"We live in a sexist world"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Pepsi is the egg"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Doritos wishes"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Pepsi is the chicken"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"Yeah Doritos wishes"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"Wait what?"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"That we didn't live in a sexist world"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"But we do"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"It's pretty DC"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Yeah"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Face facts"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"Like yeah new Doritos"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"Listen the world's sexist"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"We know that you would love"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"To just be getting nacho cheese on your fingers"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"And guzzling Doritos outside"
01:09:54;01:09:55;"But you can't"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"It's not safe for you to do that"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"Maybe in a hundred years"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Maybe in a thousand years"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"But as long as we live under the patriarchy"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"Doritos is going to do you a solid"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Doritos"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Oh yeah Doritos"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"I don't know"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"So obviously people really took that"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"And ran with it"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"There's like so many memes about it"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"But then Doritos came out"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"And said we already have Doritos for women"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"They're called Doritos"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"And they're loved by millions"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"So we get into this"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"This whole conversation"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Was this very weird meta thing"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"And then the right wing did get involved with it"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"The right wing"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"What did Hannity say this time?"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Piers Morgan called this"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"Said it was anti-feminism"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"Can we listen to Piers?"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Is there a Piers clip?"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"This is what Piers Morgan had to say about it"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Here's the other thing that's really caught my eye today"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"Because people just do stupid things on these things"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Doritos, right?"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Doritos"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"They're cheesy crisps"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"I like them"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"You can probably see by the state of me"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"How much I like them, right?"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I quite fancy them this morning actually"
01:10:49;01:10:50;"So Doritos are made by PepsiCo"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"One of the biggest companies in the world"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"PepsiCo is run by a woman"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Indra Noyar"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"She's one of the most"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"I've met her many times"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Very smart lady"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"One of the most powerful"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"Smart women in the world, right?"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"She thinks the way to progress"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Feminism and women's rights"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"Is we're going to have new Doritos"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Lady-friendly Doritos"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"They're going to be less crunchy"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Because women don't like making noise"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"They're going to be smaller"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"So they can fit into your handbag, right?"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Oh, I thought you were going to say"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"So they can fit into your mouth"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"She actually said this"
01:11:20;01:11:23;"Although women would love to crunch crisps loudly"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"Lick their fingers and pull crumbs from the bag"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"Into their mouth afterwards"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"They prefer not to do this in public, said Indra"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Really? Really?"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Let's just test this"
01:11:32;01:11:35;"Ew"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"They're not the right thing to eat"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Right, she's letting you eat Doritos"
01:11:38;01:11:41;"Doritos"
01:11:41;01:11:46;"This is disgusting"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Imagine how many more you could get in"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"If you were eating lady Doritos"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Here's Morgan"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"Doritos"
01:11:51;01:11:52;"Okay, so now"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Doritos"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"I think I finally understand Heather's email"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"She's suggesting that perhaps"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"The women of Doritos, including their leader"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Their dear leader, Indra"
01:12:03;01:12:06;"The women of Doritos"
01:12:06;01:12:10;"Oh, my lady"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"Lady Doritos"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"She's suggesting that the women of Doritos"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Believed in their heart of hearts"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"That women would benefit from having"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"A wider array of Doritos products"
01:12:22;01:12:26;"But then a weird combination of left-wing outrage"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"And weird right-wing anti-feminism"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"Came together to stymie"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"Something that actually could have shaken up"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"The Doritos status quo"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"It's that weird tension where sometimes"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"You'll find the right-wing"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"Will like call stuff sexist or racist"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"When people want to point a light to how"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"A community is being underserved"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"I'm not even"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"It's too crazy to compare it to Doritos"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"But you know there's a classic right-wing argument"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Against affirmative action"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"The left-wing says"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"We have groups in our country"
01:12:55;01:12:58;"Who've faced oppression and horror"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"And it's been horrible forever"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"I think it's reasonable"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"That we can reserve spots for them"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"In state universities or something"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"And the right-wing would say"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"No, that's racist"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"Because everybody's the same"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"I thought that proving you're not racist"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"Means that you think everybody's the same"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"You left-wingers are telling me"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"That that person because of their background"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Or their ethnic group"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"Deserves special treatment"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"That sounds pretty racist"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"So obviously much lower level here"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"But you're getting this with Piers Morgan"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"He's saying"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"Oh, you think women"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Maybe have different needs for products"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Oh, I thought that"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"That sounds pretty sexist to me"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"And maybe what Heather's trying to say is like"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Maybe some women do want more products"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"And that the patriarchy doesn't serve them"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"I'm with it"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"I'd buy Lady Doritos"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"How do you make a Dorito less crunchy though?"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Is it even still a Dorito at that point?"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"I know, that's the part that bums me out"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"They're gonna be a little soggy"
01:13:51;01:13:52;"So it's just like"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Okay, you know it's like stale"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"I also want to say something"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"Is that we've been called out on Twitter"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"On TC that we don't have enough female guests"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"We don't have enough guests period"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"Today we had no guests"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"But especially given that the makeup"
01:14:04;01:14:07;"Of the core team of Time Crisis"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"Is all male"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"We do need to get a better job"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"We used to be better at it"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"I don't know what happened"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"As we've had less guests"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"We've had less women straight up"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"We're just getting really insular"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"We're getting really insular"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"We're just like"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"And the truth is"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"The snake's eating its own tail with this show"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Basically"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"And we're a little bit like Doritos"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"We're underserving our female listeners"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"And actually I would say"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"No disrespect to the fellas"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"But a lot of our best listener emails"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"Come from women"
01:14:32;01:14:33;"True"
01:14:33;01:14:34;"I think the next show"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Because Time Crisis"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Is never timely"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"I want to get some women"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Talking about Lady Doritos"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"Because we've just had"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"We've just had a male gab session"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Here we are"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"About this stuff"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"Here we are"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"Talking about Lady Doritos"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"Just two to three guys"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Bunch of entitled guys"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"Talking Lady Doritos"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"And we haven't even heard from a woman"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"Although I do appreciate that Heather"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"Heather wrote in"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Although"
01:14:58;01:14:59;"I don't want to assume"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Maybe we shouldn't assume Heather's gender either"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"But anyway"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Next time on Time Crisis"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"I want to get into this stuff"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Because"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"For us"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"We walk through life as men"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"We buy male razors"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Although I've always enjoyed shaving"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"With women's razors"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"Like a Venus"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Never done it"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Really?"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Like shaving your face?"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"Yeah"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"You've never been"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"Looking for a razor and"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Your wife or girlfriend"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Had her"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Feminine, marketed"
01:15:28;01:15:29;"No, never used it"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"Really?"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Some of them have this like"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Built in like soft soapy stuff"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"I'll check it out, man"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"Leave you smooth as a baby"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"I love it"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Anyway"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"You're right though"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"We have not covered"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Corporate fast food enough on this show"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"So next episode"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"We're really going to go deep"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"We're going to go deeper"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"With a female perspective"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"On these timely issues"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"I think next time"
01:15:51;01:15:52;"We should basically redo"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"This whole episode with women"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Because the truth is Diet Coke used to be"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"A big thing in the US"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"And it's kind of still"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Marketed towards women"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Even though the most famous"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"D.C. drinker in America"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Is a big man"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Brutal"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"A big dumb man"
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Named Donald Trump"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"So anyway"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"We do need more female"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Perspectives on this show"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"And I'm genuinely curious"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Because this is"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"We've reached the end of our road here as men"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"We see different women"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"With different opinions on Lady Doritos"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"And we don't know"
01:16:22;01:16:23;"We can't solve this puzzle"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"Are there a lot of women out there"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Who would say thank you, Indra"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"For saying that we're different"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Than these disgusting entitled men"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Who crunch loudly"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"Or is that ingrained sexism?"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"I don't know"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"We've got to find out"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"Tune in in two weeks"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"For another 45 minutes of discussion"
01:16:38;01:16:39;"On Lady Doritos"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"We're doing a time craze"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"We're doing a T.C. Town Hall"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"Help me, I think I'm falling"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"In love again"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"When I get that crazy feeling"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"I know I'm in trouble again"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"I'm in trouble"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"I'm a rabbler and a gambler"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"And a sweet-talking ladies' man"
01:16:58;01:17:04;"And you love your loving"
01:17:04;01:17:12;"Not like you love your freedom"
01:17:12;01:17:30;"(instrumental)"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"Help me, I think I'm falling"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"In love too fast"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Please cut me open for the future"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"And worrying about the past"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Hot, hot blazes come down"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"To smoke and ash"
01:17:46;01:17:52;"We love our loving"
01:17:52;01:18:00;"Not like we love our freedom"
01:18:00;01:18:07;"(instrumental)"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"All right, Jake, you ready for the top five?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Oh, yeah."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"It's time for the top five"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"On iTunes."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"All right, Jake, this week for the top five"
01:18:18;01:18:22;"we'll be comparing the top five iTunes songs"
01:18:22;01:18:27;"right now to the top five Billboard hits of 1977,"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"the year you were born."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Yeah."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"We just can't stay away from the '70s, man."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Yep."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Wait, who else was born on the day?"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Who was the writer?"
01:18:33;01:18:34;"Sam."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"And Sam. Shout out to Sam."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"This is your birthday year."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"The number five song in 1977,"
01:18:39;01:18:43;"today, was The Silvers with ""Hotline."""
01:18:43;01:18:45;"(instrumental)"
01:18:45;01:18:48;"'77, a lot of like kind of fun, funky dance music."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Number please."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"Hotline, hotline"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Calling on the hotline"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"For your love, for your love"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"Hotline, hotline"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"Calling on the hotline"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"On the hotline"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"I'm calling on the hotline"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"For your love, for your love"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"Hotline, hotline"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"Baby, 'cause I'm burning up like a hotline"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"This kind of has like a Smokey Robinson vibe,"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"like a deep cut from like '60s work."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"It almost feels like a tiny bit of like throwback."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Yeah."
01:19:22;01:19:25;"It reminds me of like some of the music from Grease or something."
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Right, right."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"Like vaguely referencing the '50s and '60s."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Well, it's funny."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"We're talking about the 20 years nostalgia thing"
01:19:31;01:19:35;"of like all this '90s stuff that's being dramatized on TV now."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"But you think about it in the '70s, like the '50s."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"Yeah, you had Happy Days on TV."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"Early rock and roll would have been 20 years old."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"So prime for nostalgia."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"I feel like there was a lot of stuff in the late '70s"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"that was like Grease."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"Yeah, arguably all of punk rock was a little bit of a retro."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Certainly the Ramones, Blondie."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Certainly the Ramones, yeah."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"This is kind of a corny novelty single."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"Yeah, never heard that in my life."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Although it's interesting, Hotline."
01:20:05;01:20:08;"We had a Hotline hit a few years ago, Hotline Bling."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"By Drake."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"True."
01:20:10;01:20:14;"That's a nice thing that maybe a child and a grandparent could bond over."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"That's a nice continuity."
01:20:16;01:20:19;"Maybe a nine-year-old saying, ""Grandma, I love this Hotline song."""
01:20:19;01:20:21;"You mean Hotline by the Silvers?"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"""No, Grandma, I'm only eight."""
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Oh."
01:20:25;01:20:30;"Well, when I was a young woman, we had a novelty single by the Silvers."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"And it was, I don't know if you'd call it disco, but it was fun."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Kind of a throwback to early rock."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Had a slight."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"""Thank you, Grandma. I love you, Grandma."""
01:20:40;01:20:42;"That song's kind of sweet and corny."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Yeah."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"""Hotline for Your Love."""
01:20:44;01:20:47;"The number five song right now, guy who performed at the Super Bowl,"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"to very mixed reviews."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Although I think a lot of that was just hate."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It was fine."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"It was totally fine."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"It was a Super Bowl performance."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"Anybody wants to die on the hill that Justin Timberlake sucked at the Super Bowl?"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Great dancer."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"You know what?"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"Solid dancer."
01:21:01;01:21:04;"I watched the halftime show later that night."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"Oh, okay. You did have to catch that."
01:21:05;01:21:08;"I was like, ""I gotta watch this halftime show. I'm a media professional."""
01:21:08;01:21:09;"That's right."
01:21:09;01:21:13;"""I'm gonna have to weigh in on Time Crisis later this week."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Gotta watch this halftime show."""
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Yeah."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"Thought he was a great dancer."
01:21:17;01:21:20;"His catalog has a couple of monster hits."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"I know."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"He opened with that really weak new song."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Wait, this one?"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"The number five song right now?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Haters gonna hate."
01:21:28;01:21:29;"I like this opening."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"[imitates guitar]"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"This almost reminds me of like, almost Metallica?"
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Yeah, it's..."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"It's like, real minor."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"And like, heavy."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Haters gonna say it's fake."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Self real."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"Haters gonna say it's fake."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"Self real."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Haters gonna say it's fake."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"This is a good song."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"I like this song."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"This is a good song."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"Well, no. You notice that he opened with..."
01:22:04;01:22:07;"Did half the song when he's still in the basement."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Yeah."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Like, let's just get that out of the way."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"'Cause like, let's get to the good part of the set."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"But come on, once this part comes in, it's funky."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"I don't know what I'm listening to right now."
01:22:23;01:22:26;"This is just like, incoherent and like..."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"What's that?"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"[imitates guitar]"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"What the hell is this?"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"You're acting like the past 30 years of music"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"haven't had weird sounds in them."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Sometimes that can work."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Sometimes it can be really distracting."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Okay, look, fair enough."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"You don't like this song."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"All I'm saying is I saw a lot of people..."
01:22:42;01:22:43;"I don't wanna, I don't wanna..."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"You know what the song needs?"
01:22:45;01:22:48;"[imitates guitar]"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"But come on, our whole lives we've been..."
01:22:50;01:22:53;"You're a guy who listens to noisy indie rock, old hip hop."
01:22:53;01:22:56;"That has all sorts of crazy noises."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Sometimes it can work."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"In my day, music sounded more like..."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"[imitates guitar]"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"I like a nice..."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"I like a nice feedback."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"I like a nice feedback squeal."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I like a nice four-minute feedback outro."
01:23:13;01:23:18;"I like a nice Cypress Hill atonal saxophone sample."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"[imitates guitar]"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"That's the kind of sound..."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"Yeah, house of pain, dude."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"What happened to music?"
01:23:24;01:23:28;"We used to have atonal saxophone squeals and feedback"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"and now we get..."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Well, no, here's the thing."
01:23:31;01:23:31;"What's the difference, man?"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"What's the difference?"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"This is just constant."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"This is just a constant wash of this..."
01:23:35;01:23:37;"[imitates guitar]"
01:23:37;01:23:41;"[imitates guitar]"
01:23:41;01:23:45;"On Cypress Hill or house of pain, it's punctuated."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"It's one per measure."
01:23:47;01:23:48;"You know I'm right."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"[imitates guitar]"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"You had that bass wah."
01:23:51;01:23:52;"Yeah."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"What is that?"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"It's a wobbly wobble bass."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Rough."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Okay, fair enough."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"You don't like this song."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"I think that one's pretty good."
01:24:00;01:24:01;"I just want to say that, again,"
01:24:01;01:24:04;"time crisis coming with the timely takes"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"that there were so many people"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"and whatever, fans are going to say whatever,"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"but there's some high-profile journalists"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"who went so far out of their way to say how terrible"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Justin Timberlake's halftime performance was."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Lighten up, guys."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"to criticize Justin Timberlake."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"There's a lot of conversation about did he..."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Yeah, the bass wah."
01:24:23;01:24:24;"That's a legitimate reason to crit..."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"Okay, bass wah is one."
01:24:25;01:24:28;"Did he do enough to support Janet Jackson?"
01:24:29;01:24:29;"Has he made amends for that?"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"That was a major thing."
01:24:31;01:24:35;"Is his relationship to R&B as a white man,"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"has he been thoughtful about that?"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"These are all very valid questions,"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"but at the end of the day,"
01:24:40;01:24:44;"he got up there and he played most of his hits,"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"85% of which are generally regarded as great songs."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"He didn't suck."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"I agree."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"He did not suck,"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"and people want to just prove so hard"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"just until, ""Oh, boy, did he f*** up."""
01:24:57;01:25:00;"Honestly, it was 5% worse than Lady Gaga last year."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"What about the Prince thing?"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"Oh, yeah, people were mad about that."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"I was fine with it."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Well..."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"You do a cover of the guy that is the local hero"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"that just died recently."
01:25:09;01:25:10;"What's wrong with that?"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"It was off to a bad start because people thought"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"he was going to bring out a hologram."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"But he didn't."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"And Prince was on record as saying"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"he didn't like that kind of stuff."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"But he didn't do it."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"He's just had some bad luck, I think,"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"with the press a little bit."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"But paying tribute in Minneapolis"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"to one of the greatest entertainers of all time..."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"That makes sense to me."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"It'd be weirder not to do it."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"He would have been dope if he had done all Minnesota hits."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Do some replacements, do some Bob Dylan,"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"or Soul Asylum."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"Really pay tribute to the region."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"You know, him and Prince had beef during Prince's life."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"I didn't."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Okay, so maybe we don't know the whole story."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"What was the beef?"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Well, I think there were a few things."
01:25:44;01:25:47;"But one thing was when Sexy Back came out,"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Prince was quoted,"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"or he did some press conference or interview"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"where he kind of made this joke, you know,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"""Why are you trying to bring Sexy Back?"""
01:25:55;01:25:57;"""Sexy never left,"" saying, ""I'm Prince."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"I'm sexy. I'm still here."""
01:25:59;01:26:02;"And then Justin did this song with Nelly Furtado"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"and Timbaland."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"You remember this song?"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"And he has this line in it that's like a subtweet"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"at Prince where he says, ""If Sexy never left,"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"why is everybody on my s--t?"""
01:26:12;01:26:14;"And so there was this kind of like"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"very low-key, subterranean kind of beef"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"happening with him and Prince."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"It was a cold war of sexiness."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"[laughing]"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"It never reached a violent phase,"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"but there was some deep tension."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"It was a great--"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"It seemed like Prince wasn't a fan of JT,"
01:26:32;01:26:33;"is all I'm saying."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"Didn't Prince--"
01:26:34;01:26:35;"He was kind of hard on a lot of people, right?"
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Yeah."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"He was kind of a grump a little bit, right?"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"No."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"Prince was infamously a very funny hater."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"And I think that when he--"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"He had fun with it."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"He had fun with it."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"He was known to--"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"Well, in a recent interview,"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Quincy Jones suggested that Prince once tried"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"to mow down Michael Jackson with his car."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"So maybe it wasn't always fun in games."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Some of those Quincy interviews recently have been gold."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"There are some strong moments."
01:26:59;01:27:02;"But he also said that once Prince gave Michael"
01:27:02;01:27:07;"a weird box of strange items to kind of scare him."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Whoa."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"Like some weird cufflinks."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Just like voodoo dolls and stuff."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"And apparently Prince would call Michael Jackson ""Camille"""
01:27:13;01:27:14;"just to get under his skin."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"Wow."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"I've heard all sorts of funny stories about Prince"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"just being kind of a prankster."
01:27:18;01:27:19;"Right."
01:27:19;01:27:20;"He's a funny dude."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Yeah."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"I mean, he was. Rest in peace."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"So I would also say that I hope that that wasn't real beef."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Because if you're Justin Timberlake"
01:27:27;01:27:31;"and a legend like Prince makes a funny, off-the-cuff comment"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"like, oh, I wasn't aware that sexy left,"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"I hope that he was responding in jest."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"Because like--"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"I'm sure."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Yeah, that doesn't sound like real beef."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"He doesn't seem like a guy that's taken himself"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"overly seriously."
01:27:42;01:27:43;"Yeah."
01:27:43;01:27:46;"So Justin Timberlake did not suck at the Super Bowl."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"You're going to hear first."
01:27:47;01:27:50;"That Justin Timberlake did not suck at the Super Bowl."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Now, if you're one of those people--"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"if you're like a Diet Coke drinker with just"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"that intense technological nihilism,"
01:27:55;01:27:58;"and you just think everything sucks, and you want to say,"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"no, Justin Timberlake sucked, just like Lady Gaga sucked,"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"just like everything sucks, just like the Super Bowl sucked,"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"just like modern life sucks, I'm with that."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"Except Bitcoin."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"[laughs]"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Bitcoin."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"BC and DC."
01:28:11;01:28:14;"What's a beverage that pairs nicely with Bitcoin?"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Diet Coke."
01:28:16;01:28:20;"The number four song back in '77, your birth year, Jake,"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"was ""Daz"" by Brick."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"I like this song."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"I was a week old at this point."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Wait, were you born in Connecticut?"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"I was."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"My parents were living in upstate New York,"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"but the closest hospital was in Connecticut."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"They crossed state lines."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"Yeah."
01:28:38;01:28:43;"I was born in 1977 in suburban Connecticut."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"This song playing."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"[laughs]"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"Yeah, I wonder what car my parents were, like,"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"going to the hospital to and fro."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"The Buick?"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"I'm thinking, like, an early '70s Subaru or something."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"Wait, what town in Connecticut were you--"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"I was born in Sharon, which is right near the New York state"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"border."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"But then I grew up in Southbury, Connecticut."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Yeah."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"They moved there, like, a year later."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"Southbury, Connecticut, 1977."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"It was no joke."
01:29:07;01:29:11;"This was the place to see and be seen."
01:29:11;01:29:15;"And this group of fellas were ready to be seen."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Construction on the Southford Plaza"
01:29:17;01:29:20;"had just broken ground in May of '77."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"By August, the McDonald's would be open."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"[laughs]"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Later that year, Kmart broke ground."
01:29:30;01:29:49;"This is a total montage scene of super fun."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Super funky."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"In my neighborhood."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"But in my neighborhood, Southbury, Connecticut."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"[laughs]"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Great song."
01:30:00;01:30:03;"I used to have a funk compilation as a kid."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"That song was on it."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"I always liked it."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"'70s funk, incredible."
01:30:07;01:30:08;"And popular."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"I mean, I feel like every time we do a '70s top five,"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"it's, like, half instrumental funk songs."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Yeah, I mean, that first song was kind of whack,"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"but that was a cool song."
01:30:17;01:30:23;"The number four single on iTunes right now, in our era,"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"is a new Drake one."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"It's called ""God's Plan."""
01:30:25;01:30:26;"""God's Plan."""
01:30:26;01:30:28;"I'll be honest, when I first heard this,"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"I was kind of like, Drake's running out of steam."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"He's got nothing to talk about anymore."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"And then I see videos of large groups of frat boys"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"rapping the words as if this is one of his best singles."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"What do I know?"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"Well, if it's touching frat boys,"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"then you know it's gold."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"That's right."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"You know how I like it when you loving on me."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"I don't want to die for them to miss me."
01:30:53;01:30:56;"Yes, I see the things that they wishing on me."
01:30:56;01:30:59;"Hope I got some brothers that'll live me."
01:30:59;01:31:03;"They gonna tell the story what's different with me."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"God's plan."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"God's plan."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"Interesting fact about Drake, he's Canadian."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Really?"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Yeah, he's from Toronto."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Not a lot of Canadian rappers."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"That must be hard for him."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"Yeah."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"Does he live in Toronto still?"
01:31:18;01:31:19;"Is he around town?"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I think he has homes, properties."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"He actually has a restaurant there."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Really?"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Yeah, you see him around."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"I'd be in like a shopping mall and I would see him."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"You think he can afford to keep a place in Toronto?"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"Yeah, I think so."
01:31:30;01:31:34;"I feel like work would probably take him to LA so often"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"that that place is probably sitting empty half the time."
01:31:36;01:31:37;"I think he commutes."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"I think he's back to Toronto."
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Maybe he's got it on Airbnb."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"Yeah, he does that, yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Bad things."
01:31:43;01:31:47;"A lot of bad things that they wish and I wish and I wish."
01:31:47;01:31:50;"As we talked about last time, Drake still is very stressed"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"out about the haters."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I get it, man."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"It's very hard to-- the haters never leave."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"They're going to say it's fake."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Haters going to say it's fake."
01:31:58;01:32:02;"Actually, yeah, there's two songs in a row in 2018 about haters."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"Stressed about haters."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"Bad things that they wishing on me."
01:32:06;01:32:09;"Well, you know, I guess the positive spin would be like"
01:32:09;01:32:13;"if Justin Timberlake and Drake, two very wealthy men,"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"are still stressed about haters, then that means that money"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"doesn't buy happiness."
01:32:18;01:32:21;"Can't buy me love."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"Drake always reminds me of that Dylan song, Positively 4th"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"Street."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"Like, it's like the same--"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"You got it, Latin Earth."
01:32:28;01:32:31;"The song, that's like all like really organ driven, which is"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"sort of like the synth of its day."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Right."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Something in this like very paranoid, like, you're a fake"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"friend, you come up and smile to me, but I know you want me"
01:32:40;01:32:41;"to fail."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"Yeah, you're right."
01:32:42;01:32:44;"That song, it's one of my favorite Dylan songs, but every"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"single Drake song, I'm always just like, it always reminds"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"me of that."
01:32:48;01:32:51;"You say how are you good luck, but you don't mean it."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"Fans of the show, look up Positively 4th Street."
01:32:54;01:32:57;"Great song, very influenced by Drake."
01:32:57;01:32:58;"That one."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Yep."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"Back to the 1977, we got Leo Sayer, You Make Me Feel Like"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"Dancing."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"This is like the epitome of--"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"You make me feel like dancing."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"--of just like late 70s goofiness."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"Yeah."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"Ooh."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Sick bass."
01:33:18;01:33:25;"(SINGING) You've got a cute way of talking."
01:33:25;01:33:28;"You've got the better of me."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Sick falsetto."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"(SINGING) Just snap your fingers--"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Jake, you know who's playing guitar on this?"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Uh, give me a hint."
01:33:36;01:33:39;"He's a very respected funk songwriter, guitarist,"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"and performer, but for most people,"
01:33:42;01:33:49;"he became defined by a novelty single for a '80s comedy."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Massive '80s single."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"Ray Parker Jr."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"Ray Parker Jr., yeah."
01:33:52;01:33:55;"A lot of people know Ray Parker Jr. is playing guitar right"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"here, as the guy who said, ""Ghostbusters."""
01:33:57;01:33:58;"Wrote the song."
01:33:58;01:33:59;"But he's an incredible--"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Session guy?"
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Yeah."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"And he had his own band called Radio."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"Oh, really?"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"Yeah."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"He's still got a studio up in North Hollywood."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"Have you met him?"
01:34:08;01:34:09;"No."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Dude, there's some sessions up there, man."
01:34:11;01:34:14;"I know somebody's done sessions with him, and they're like,"
01:34:14;01:34:17;"you know, Ray Parker Jr.'s an incredible, like, guitarist,"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"and he's got his own studio still in North Hollywood."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Wow."
01:34:20;01:34:25;"(SINGING) Just hold me tight and leave on the line."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"'Cause I don't want to go far."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"That's just some feel-good '70s [bleep].."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Can't say anything bad about it."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Back to our modern times."
01:34:33;01:34:36;"The number three song is ""The Weekend"" and Kendrick Lamar"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"from the Black Panther soundtrack, ""Pray For Me."""
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Wow, I haven't heard this yet."
01:34:42;01:34:44;"Have you seen ""Black Panther?"""
01:34:44;01:34:45;"Is it out yet?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"I saw an early screening."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Really?"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"I saw a very early screening, I'm proud to say."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"I'm humble bragging."
01:34:51;01:34:52;"I'm just bragging to say."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"It's very good."
01:34:53;01:34:56;"(SINGING) I'm always ready for a war again."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"Is this ""Weekend"" here?"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Yep."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"(SINGING) Go down that road again."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Does this have too much noisy bassline for you?"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"No, I'm in."
01:35:02;01:35:03;"I'm in."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"It's sparse."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"It's not annoying."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"It's not messy."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"The JT single's just, like, a mess."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"[laughs]"
01:35:09;01:35:10;"JT is a mess."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"No, just the JT single."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Jeb is a mess."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"This is, like, clean and bright."
01:35:18;01:35:21;"Man, I heard ""Starboy"" the other day on the radio."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Yeah."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"I was like, that song is tight."
01:35:24;01:35:25;"You're a ""Weekend"" fan."
01:35:25;01:35:26;"I kind of am."
01:35:26;01:35:29;"And it brought me back to early TC days."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Those are the days."
01:35:31;01:35:35;"Peak of the show, 2015."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"It's good to get some home."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Show's gone downhill."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"It's true."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"It's good to get some weekend back on TC."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"It's been a while."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Yeah, it feels real good."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"It's been a solid four or five months."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"Breath of fresh air."
01:35:48;01:35:52;"(RAPPING) I fight the world."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"I fight you."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"I fight myself."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"I fight God."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"Just tell me how many burdens left."
01:35:56;01:35:57;"I fight pain and hurricanes."
01:35:57;01:35:58;"The day I wept."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"I'm trying to fight back tears."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Flood on my doorsteps."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Life and living."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"You like this song?"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Yeah, I mean, sure."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"I--"
01:36:04;01:36:05;"It's a soundtrack song."
01:36:05;01:36:06;"I'm not really--"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"I mean, I was just going to say, it's funny."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"It's always funny to me."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"There's another Ghostbusters."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"They could have gotten Rick Parker Jr."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"Ghostbusters is like--"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"Black Panther."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Who you going to call?"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"But Ghostbusters is like--"
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Da-na-na-na-na-na."
01:36:15;01:36:19;"--a funny song to fit the mood of the movie."
01:36:19;01:36:23;"And I don't like it when there's like super earnest songs"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"for like comic book movies."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"It's like, come on, guys."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"It's like so serious."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"And actually, I will say that there's jokes in the movie."
01:36:29;01:36:30;"I would hope so."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"There's like some lightness."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"Is it rated R?"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"PG-13?"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"I don't know."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"Probably PG-13."
01:36:35;01:36:38;"They want to sell tickets to kids, right?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Yeah."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I can't imagine it would be rated R."
01:36:41;01:36:45;"But there's like some solid comic relief in the film."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Are you going to see it, Jake?"
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Yeah, probably."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Are you up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe?"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"No."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"I don't like comic book movies."
01:36:51;01:36:52;"OK."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"I saw Wonder Woman last year."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"I thought that sucked."
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Oh!"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"It was awful."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"Here's my concern with Black Panther."
01:36:59;01:37:03;"Is there a 40-minute fight scene at the end in a warehouse?"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"No."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"OK."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Is there a long drawn out?"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Is it like 40 minutes too long, the movie?"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"Or 20 minutes too long?"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"No, it didn't feel too long."
01:37:12;01:37:15;"Look, any movie you could probably cut down 10 minutes or 15."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"It didn't feel like egregiously long."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Give me like an hour 40."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"That's what I want."
01:37:19;01:37:24;"And one thing that's fresh about it is that it's a mostly black cast, which is very rare."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Yeah."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"For any kind of big budget movie, let alone a comic book movie."
01:37:27;01:37:34;"And most of it takes place in the fictional African nation of Wakanda."
01:37:34;01:37:37;"So, no, but it gives it a freshness that it's like not--"
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Do they have like crazy powers?"
01:37:38;01:37:43;"I just hate it when like people have like shooting flames and like lightning bolts out of their hands."
01:37:43;01:37:47;"And they're just like buildings are exploding and dudes are jumping over buildings."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"OK."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Essentially, you're saying you just like regular action movies."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Yeah, yeah."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"No, Jake, it is a--"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"We've covered this before."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"It's a superhero movie."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"I like Die Hard."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"I like-- but see, I like Batman."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Batman, he doesn't have any special powers."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"But he's doing crazy [bleep]"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"No, I know, but it's not like--"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"You don't like when people jump too high."
01:38:04;01:38:04;"I don't like the Batman movies."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"OK, so you just don't like superhero movies."
01:38:06;01:38:09;"I like the first one from like 30 years ago."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"OK, you don't like superhero movies."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"You're like, OK, but just--"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"No, no, no, I don't like superhero movies."
01:38:12;01:38:15;"OK, no, I'm excited to check it out, but it's not one of those movies--"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"I'll feel like I'll see it out of just momentum of the culture."
01:38:18;01:38:25;"Like I'll just be in a situation where people are like, hey, so and so and so and so are going to see Black Panther on Sunday."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Like, should we go?"
01:38:26;01:38:27;"OK."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"You should see it."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"It's good."
01:38:29;01:38:33;"But I'm saying, I was responding to you saying, does it take place like all in like anonymous groups?"
01:38:33;01:38:37;"And I'm saying, no, most of it takes place in the fictional African nation of Wakanda."
01:38:37;01:38:47;"So whether you love the film or not, it's like you're seeing this kind of interesting mix of kind of like the nature of the nation,"
01:38:47;01:38:51;"like kind of beautiful plains and mountains, and they have this kind of like special technology."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"It's just some shit you haven't seen before."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"OK, cool."
01:38:53;01:38:58;"And then there is like the kind of slightly more basic South Korean casino scene."
01:38:58;01:39:00;"See, that piques my interest."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"That's-- OK."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"And there are powers."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"There's a lot of tech."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"You know, there's a strong James Bond element in it."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"That could be cool."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"There's tech."
01:39:09;01:39:12;"Although late period Bond, I also struggle with."
01:39:12;01:39:13;"Yeah, some of those movies are tough."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Time for a new Bond, right?"
01:39:15;01:39:19;"Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of talk that people have been saying, could Idris Elba be the next Bond?"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Seems like a slam dunk."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Yeah, why not?"
01:39:22;01:39:30;"Anyway, the number two song in 1977 was from a classic album, Songs in the Key of Life."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"Stevie."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"Is this Sir Duke?"
01:39:32;01:39:33;"No, I wish."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"I mean, there's a lot of monster hits on that album."
01:39:36;01:39:37;"I wish."
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Very funky."
01:39:38;01:39:46;"Some younger people might be more familiar with this song in the Will Smith version called Going Straight to the Wild Wild West, which sampled this."
01:39:46;01:39:47;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"I forgot that."
01:39:48;01:39:53;"We going straight to the wild wild west."
01:39:53;01:39:58;"Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"We don't talk about Stevie Wonder enough."
01:40:00;01:40:05;"We talk about faithful 70s palette, but also insane adventurous."
01:40:05;01:40:14;"Yeah, his run of albums in the 70s is comparable to the Kanye's, the Radiohead's, the Beatles, whatever."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"These people famously have these album runs."
01:40:16;01:40:23;"We were happy with the jolly day with Bree sneaking out the back door."
01:40:23;01:40:27;"Hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine."
01:40:27;01:40:30;"Ooh."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Really got your back, so."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"You know what's cool about Stevie, too?"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"He produced the album."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Did he play every instrument, too?"
01:40:38;01:40:39;"Or is that a mockable?"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"I don't know."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"He probably could have."
01:40:42;01:40:43;"I feel like I've heard that."
01:40:43;01:40:47;"Thinking it might stop her from whipping your behind."
01:40:47;01:40:50;"That pistol game's good."
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Come back once more."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"Why did those days end?"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Why did you go?"
01:40:56;01:40:59;"That pistol game's good."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Come back once more."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Why did those days end?"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Why did you go?"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I haven't checked his albums in a while."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"I kind of want to revisit like Secret Life of Plants and stuff."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"That's when he got weird."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Yeah."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"But as far as like--"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Those are good, though."
01:41:13;01:41:17;"Actually, in the '70s, he won Album of the Year at the Grammys,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"I think, twice in a row."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"And then he took a year off and came back and won it again."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Really?"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Yeah."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"He had an incredible run."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Talking Book, Inner Vision."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Inner Vision's Songs in the Key of Life."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"Unbelievable run."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Oh, wow."
01:41:30;01:41:36;"That's a pretty cool song to have on the charts when you were born."
01:41:36;01:41:40;"Back to our time, we got another appearance by Justin Timberlake"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"on the Top 5 iTunes Songs."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"Ooh, a new song."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"I have a feeling he's still-- he got a new album out."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"He headlined the Super Bowl."
01:41:46;01:41:50;"Haters going to say it's fake, but he's got real fans."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"This is Justin Timberlake featuring Chris Stapleton."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"You remember him?"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"Oh, sure."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"He's a country singer."
01:41:55;01:41:56;"It's called Say Something."
01:41:59;01:42:25;","
01:42:25;01:42:27;"So this is kind of a country song."
01:42:27;01:42:32;"It's produced by Timbaland and some other people."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"It's kind of country R&B."
01:42:39;01:42:42;"[vocalizing]"
01:42:46;01:43:11;"Is Chris singing?"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"I think they're both singing."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Very long chorus."
01:43:21;01:43:31;"[vocalizing]"
01:43:36;01:43:40;"This is Chris."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"You know, I wouldn't call this country."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"That's weak."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"People have been, like, questioning a lot of JT's"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"country on this album."
01:43:52;01:43:58;"But if anything, that mix of kind of minor acoustic guitar"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"and some slight nods to hip hop and R&B"
01:44:00;01:44:03;"makes me actually think more of some late '90s music,"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"such as this."
01:44:07;01:44:10;"Sound familiar to you, Jake?"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"It does."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Is this Everlast?"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"Yeah."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"[singing]"
01:44:17;01:44:18;"Say something."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Oh, Whitey Ford?"
01:44:19;01:44:20;"Yeah, yeah."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"Synth Blues?"
01:44:22;01:44:26;"Whatever genre this is, this is what that JT song is."
01:44:38;01:44:41;"Yeah, this is so much more legit."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"You feeling this one?"
01:44:42;01:44:46;"It sounds, like, more inspired and, like, sort of"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"authentic to this guy's vibe."
01:44:49;01:44:52;"The other one just felt overcooked, like, in a lab"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"or something."
01:44:56;01:45:05;"[singing]"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Say something."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"What do you think about how on the bridge to say something,"
01:45:10;01:45:11;"it's like--"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"the line is, like, sometimes the greatest way to say something"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"is to say nothing at all, is the sort of, like,"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"crux of the whole song."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"It seems like what you were talking about earlier."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"Right."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Maybe he did hedge his bets too much."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"I love Justin Timberlake, so I don't want to, like, beat up"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"on him."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"But it seemed like some of the negative responses"
01:45:27;01:45:30;"were people feeling like it was too down the middle."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"I've never heard a song that stands up"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"for not taking a stand at all."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"It's like the anti-protest song."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"There's a good Strokes song that I always"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"liked on their third album, where the hook went,"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"(SINGING) I've got nothing to say."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"I've got nothing to say."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"That was legit too."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"I've got nothing to say."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"That's a tight song."
01:45:50;01:45:53;"(SINGING) I drink Diet Coke, and I still like to smoke."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"I've got nothing to say."
01:45:54;01:45:57;"What's the John Mayer one that has, like, a similar vibe?"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"It was a big hit a couple of years ago."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"It was, like, um--"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"About having-- that you shouldn't say anything?"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Or just, like--"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Wait, you mean the one that was about, like--"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Waiting on the world to change."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"Waiting on the world to change."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"It's, like, very futile."
01:46:10;01:46:11;"Just, like, you're just giving up."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"You're just like, (SINGING) waiting on the world."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"I just keep on waiting."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"Is that what it is?"

01:57:41;01:57:43;"This is a family show."
