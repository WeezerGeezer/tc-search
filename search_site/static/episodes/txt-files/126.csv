00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis back once again. It's summertime. So in this episode we will change our formula slightly"
00:09;00:18;"to give you a summertime edition of Time Crisis. We will be joined by the absolute legend Bruce"
00:18;00:28;"Hornsby to talk his new album The Grateful Dead and of course The Range. This is Time Crisis"
00:28;00:30;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:32;"Let's begin."
00:38;00:43;"Passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:51;"You were a felt who robbed me, all my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"Deep and lonely bay"
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis back again, what's up Jake?"
01:22;01:23;"Not much, how are you?"
01:23;01:28;"I'm alright, what'd you do during your bye week?"
01:28;01:31;"Let's see, that's last week, things have been a little slow"
01:31;01:33;"Well you've completed your Chuck E. Cheese painting"
01:33;01:36;"That's right, that was last week, that was a big moment"
01:36;01:39;"For anybody who hasn't seen, Jake, I think you posted on Instagram"
01:39;01:42;"But you just finished this great Chuck E. Cheese painting"
01:42;01:44;"We've been talking about Chuck E. Cheese recently"
01:44;01:46;"I think even since the last episode they went bankrupt"
01:46;01:48;"So they've really been in the news lately"
01:48;01:51;"You've been wanting to paint a Chuck E. Cheese for a couple years?"
01:51;01:55;"I don't think that long, I mean I've just been dealing with that subject matter for many years"
01:55;01:57;"But specifically Chuck E., I was like"
01:57;02:02;"In the last six months I just had kind of a hankering for a Chuck E. Cheese painting"
02:02;02:04;"I mean, your timing couldn't be better though"
02:04;02:10;"Yeah, then I worked up a good image that I thought would work at a large scale for a painting"
02:10;02:14;"And started it like three or four weeks ago"
02:14;02:19;"Right around the time that I think we did the Chuck E. Cheese history episode"
02:19;02:19;"Yeah"
02:19;02:24;"And then the news dropped last week and then my social media was blowing up with TC heads being like"
02:24;02:29;"""Dude, Chuck E.'s going out"" and then I dropped the bomb of this brand new painting"
02:29;02:32;"So, is Chuck E. Cheese really going out?"
02:32;02:34;"I've always been confused about that because like"
02:34;02:38;"Declaring bankruptcy, that's kind of like an accounting maneuver"
02:38;02:39;"Right?"
02:39;02:40;"I don't totally understand"
02:40;02:45;"I feel like I've heard that Sears is like going out of business for the last like 20 years"
02:45;02:49;"But we just bought a dishwasher from Sears yesterday"
02:49;02:50;"Really?"
02:50;02:54;"And there's gonna be a Sears technician that comes to the house and installs it"
02:54;02:55;"Interesting"
02:55;03:00;"I wonder if he's gonna be wearing a Sears uniform or if he's some kind of third party hired gun"
03:00;03:03;"This came up, he's gonna be wearing a Sears uniform"
03:03;03:06;"Because the plumber was over yesterday, here we go"
03:06;03:08;"[Laughter]"
03:08;03:10;"Boring domestic quarantine stories"
03:10;03:13;"The plumber was over yesterday and he was like"
03:13;03:16;"""Look, you can buy the dishwasher from like Best Buy or Home Depot"""
03:16;03:19;"""But they're gonna farm out installation"""
03:19;03:22;"""And if there's a problem, then it's like 'Oh, who's left holding the bag?'"""
03:22;03:25;"So he's like ""Get a dishwasher from Sears"""
03:25;03:29;"""So if there's a problem with the dishwasher, if they're missing a part, whatever, the Sears guy"""
03:29;03:34;"""It's all one company that's handling the sale of the product and the installation of the product"""
03:34;03:35;"More accountability"
03:35;03:38;"This is weirdly related to Chuck E. Cheese"
03:38;03:40;"The reason we had to get a new dishwasher"
03:40;03:42;"Is that..."
03:42;03:43;"This is nasty"
03:43;03:44;"Our last dishwasher started leaking"
03:44;03:46;"Wait, I gotta guess, Nat, wait"
03:46;03:50;"I guess it either has something to do with rats or pizza"
03:50;03:53;"You're right, it has to do with the first, rats"
03:53;03:56;"You got a rat's nest in your dishwasher?"
03:56;03:59;"Well, under the dishwasher"
03:59;04:00;"The dishwasher started leaking"
04:00;04:05;"I like, removed that little like, plastic kind of skirt at the bottom of the dishwasher"
04:05;04:08;"And looked under, and there was a rat's nest"
04:08;04:10;"It was so nasty, dude, it was like"
04:10;04:15;"They had dragged in sticks and just like, random garbage and like"
04:15;04:19;"They just like, burrowed through like, the wall and back of the dishwasher"
04:19;04:21;"And they chewed through all the piping"
04:21;04:22;"Oh god"
04:22;04:24;"So rats actually build a nest?"
04:24;04:26;"I guess so"
04:26;04:30;"They chew through all the plastic tubes where all the water runs through"
04:30;04:31;"So that was causing the leak"
04:31;04:37;"I read an article when quarantine first started that was about"
04:37;04:40;"Mechanics getting a lot of people coming in with car trouble"
04:40;04:42;"That he determined was caused by rats"
04:42;04:45;"Because people's cars are sitting around more"
04:45;04:47;"And it's similar, in the article they described that"
04:47;04:50;"Rats chew through wires because it's kind of what they're programmed to do"
04:50;04:53;"In nature, they would chew on vines and stuff"
04:53;04:56;"Because their teeth grow so fast and so sharp"
04:56;04:58;"That if they're not constantly gnawing"
04:58;05:01;"Their teeth would actually like, grow into their like, jaw"
05:01;05:03;"And like, yeah, it would mess them up"
05:03;05:06;"So basically their teeth grow way faster and sharper than a human's"
05:06;05:08;"They need to always be gnawing"
05:08;05:12;"So in an urban environment where they're not finding all the usual things to gnaw on"
05:12;05:14;"They're like, always looking for wires"
05:14;05:17;"And there's sometimes even certain things"
05:17;05:22;"Used in the casing of wires that they find kind of like, tasty or attractive"
05:22;05:25;"So anyway, a lot of people rolling up with rat nests in their engines"
05:25;05:27;"I've wondered about that"
05:27;05:30;"Because sometimes I get in my car and it like"
05:30;05:33;"Inexplicably smells like s***"
05:33;05:35;"Like animal s***, like cat s***"
05:35;05:38;"Because I park in this alley under this tree usually"
05:38;05:41;"And you also, as we've discussed, you have a big minivan"
05:41;05:43;"With only two seats up front"
05:43;05:45;"So there's a lot of room to party in"
05:45;05:48;"Oh my god, can you imagine like some insane horror movie"
05:48;05:50;"You come out to your car at like 3 in the morning"
05:50;05:53;"And there's just like 800 rats just like"
05:53;05:54;"Just swarm you while you're driving"
05:54;05:56;"A rat king"
05:56;05:57;"A rat king? I was actually thinking about that"
05:57;06:00;"Are you familiar with the concept of a rat king, Jake?"
06:00;06:01;"Deeply"
06:01;06:04;"So a rat king is just when a ton of rats get their tails"
06:04;06:08;"Irreversibly tied together in kind of a circular formation"
06:08;06:09;"Yeah"
06:09;06:14;"Oftentimes it's gum that adheres the tails together or sap"
06:14;06:15;"Gum?"
06:15;06:15;"Yeah"
06:15;06:19;"You wouldn't think gum would have the power to do that"
06:19;06:20;"This is an awful conversation"
06:20;06:22;"Yeah, truly terrifying"
06:22;06:24;"Just the plumber rolling up just like"
06:24;06:29;"Alright, you got a rat king under the dishwasher"
06:29;06:30;"It's gonna cost you"
06:30;06:33;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:33;06:36;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:36;06:46;"All you little kids who are thinking this is where I'm at"
06:46;06:49;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
06:49;06:59;"Walking down the street, carrying my face to the back"
06:59;07:01;"Oh, I think I smell a rat"
07:01;07:03;"Alright, well that's gonna be cool"
07:03;07:06;"You can even get to check out a uniformed Sears officer"
07:06;07:10;"Yeah, maybe I can ask them about the status of the company"
07:10;07:13;"I thought you guys declared bankruptcy like three or four times"
07:13;07:14;"What's going on?"
07:14;07:16;"I feel like Sears has gone bankrupt"
07:16;07:19;"every other year, like since I've been 10"
07:19;07:20;"Yes"
07:20;07:23;"What are companies that straight up vanished off the face of the earth?"
07:23;07:24;"Like are done done?"
07:24;07:26;"Pan Am went fully out of business"
07:26;07:27;"That must have been pretty wild"
07:27;07:31;"You had the giant building in New York was the Pan Am building"
07:31;07:33;"So that must have really felt like the end of an era"
07:33;07:35;"Blockbuster Video"
07:35;07:37;"Does Blockbuster Video in any way still exist?"
07:37;07:40;"There's like one in like Bend, Oregon"
07:40;07:44;"But like as a corporation, it is not a thing"
07:44;07:48;"They were defunct as of January 12, 2014"
07:48;07:50;"The Bend, Oregon, you're right, absolutely"
07:50;07:51;"That's the final one"
07:51;07:55;"And I guess before that, there were a few left in Western Australia"
07:55;07:57;"But they all closed last year"
07:57;08:00;"Western? That is so deep"
08:00;08:02;"Western Australia is very deep"
08:02;08:04;"You know, like we've been there a lot over the years"
08:04;08:06;"playing shows in Perth"
08:06;08:08;"It's a cool city"
08:08;08:11;"You don't definitely don't feel like you're in the middle of nowhere or anything"
08:11;08:13;"But the thing people always say"
08:13;08:14;"I don't know exactly what the language is"
08:14;08:19;"Is that Perth is like the largest metropolitan area"
08:19;08:21;"that's the most isolated"
08:21;08:25;"Just because the next metropolitan area that's like the same size of it"
08:25;08:27;"is so far away"
08:27;08:30;"You know, Australia is like roughly the same size as the US"
08:30;08:32;"In terms of ge- wow, yeah, that's crazy"
08:32;08:33;"In terms of geography"
08:33;08:35;"It is kind of the same way I feel about Pennsylvania"
08:35;08:37;"I always forget how wide it is"
08:37;08:40;"So you're like getting on the flight from like Sydney to Perth"
08:40;08:41;"And you're just like, wait, how long is this flight again?"
08:41;08:42;"You're just like, oh my god"
08:42;08:44;"It's like flying from New York to LA"
08:44;08:46;"But I think the geography of Australia"
08:46;08:48;"Maybe an Australian could correct me"
08:48;08:52;"But it's almost as if the US was like LA"
08:52;08:55;"And then all the other big cities of the country were just like"
08:55;08:58;"New York, Atlanta, and like New Orleans"
08:58;08:59;"Right"
08:59;09:01;"So I can imagine outside of Perth"
09:01;09:04;"in this big state of Western Australia"
09:04;09:08;"There probably were tiny little like towns"
09:08;09:11;"where people still really relied on their blockbusters"
09:11;09:13;"I was thinking about DVDs yesterday"
09:13;09:15;"'Cause I was in a Best Buy"
09:15;09:17;"I was checking out dishwashers"
09:17;09:19;"This was before we decided to go with Sears"
09:19;09:21;"They were just like selling"
09:21;09:24;"Rambo 2 and Rambo 3"
09:24;09:26;"on DVD"
09:26;09:28;"for like $14.99"
09:28;09:31;"Yes, they're selling like full price Rambo DVDs"
09:31;09:33;"And they had like multiple copies"
09:33;09:34;"I've been working on a song"
09:34;09:37;"Well, I've been messing around with a song for a few years"
09:37;09:39;"That's called DVD Store"
09:39;09:39;"Oh"
09:39;09:41;"That's all I'll say about it"
09:41;09:41;"Okay"
09:41;09:43;"Maybe it'll be on the next album"
09:43;09:44;"Maybe on something else"
09:44;09:50;"But I've also found that a very evocative phrase"
09:50;09:52;"DVD Store"
09:52;09:55;"Yo, I wanted to watch the film Inland Empire"
09:55;09:57;"by David Lynch a couple weeks ago"
09:57;09:58;"Oh yeah"
09:58;10:01;"And I learned that it is only available on DVD"
10:01;10:02;"You can't stream it"
10:02;10:03;"You have to buy it"
10:03;10:04;"For whatever reason"
10:04;10:07;"Well, David Lynch famously will not let his movies be streamed"
10:07;10:08;"And"
10:08;10:09;"All of these"
10:09;10:10;"That's not true"
10:10;10:12;"No, most of his"
10:12;10:13;"All the ones that he can"
10:13;10:15;"that he has control over"
10:15;10:15;"Oh, maybe"
10:15;10:16;"Does not want to stream"
10:16;10:18;"And if you buy the DVD"
10:18;10:19;"In my experience"
10:19;10:21;"or watch the DVD"
10:21;10:21;"of all movies"
10:21;10:23;"certainly Mulholland Drive"
10:23;10:25;"and the other ones I can remember"
10:25;10:27;"He won't put in chapters"
10:27;10:29;"So you have to watch the whole movie"
10:29;10:30;"Oh"
10:30;10:33;"Because he doesn't like people skipping around it"
10:33;10:34;"It's wild"
10:34;10:35;"Interesting"
10:35;10:37;"That might be the only movie he controls"
10:37;10:38;"Because I feel like a lot of them were on"
10:38;10:40;"like Criterion channel"
10:40;10:42;"So wait, did you buy a Seinfeld?"
10:42;10:44;"No, because I don't even own a DVD player anymore"
10:44;10:46;"So I had this whole debate over like"
10:46;10:49;"Do I buy a DVD player just to see this one film"
10:49;10:51;"that I just wanted to like watch right now?"
10:51;10:52;"And the answer is no"
10:52;10:54;"I'm going to do a number crunch for you right now"
10:54;10:56;"I'm going on eBay"
10:56;11:00;"And I'm going to see what the cheapest DVD player I can find is"
11:00;11:02;"I guess it's the starting bid"
11:02;11:06;"But it says free local pickup in Crystal Lake, Illinois"
11:06;11:09;"It's a DVD VHS combo"
11:09;11:10;"Starting bid $5"
11:10;11:11;"There's nobody's bidding on it"
11:11;11:13;"So I bet you could actually get it for $5"
11:13;11:15;"I'm seeing some other ones that are like"
11:15;11:17;"Buy it now for $30"
11:17;11:19;"A little steep"
11:19;11:21;"I don't want the hardware in my house though"
11:21;11:23;"just to watch a single film"
11:23;11:24;"Buy the DVD"
11:24;11:25;"Buy the DVD player, watch it"
11:25;11:27;"and then throw them both away"
11:27;11:30;"That's... no"
11:30;11:33;"If I give you the DVD player for $5"
11:33;11:34;"and the DVD..."
11:34;11:35;"What's that running like?"
11:35;11:36;"$15, $20?"
11:36;11:38;"Guys, now I have to like"
11:38;11:39;"get it in the mail"
11:39;11:41;"like open the box"
11:41;11:42;"You know, before COVID"
11:42;11:44;"you would sometimes go see"
11:44;11:47;"you know, Avengers, Flavor Blasted, 4D"
11:47;11:50;"You know, the ticket could easily have been $19"
11:50;11:51;"plus parking and all this stuff"
11:51;11:54;"Even just for a solo viewing"
11:54;11:57;"it could easily cost $40 to go see the Avengers"
11:57;11:59;"So you would pay $40 to go see the Avengers"
11:59;12:02;"but not $20 to support local business?"
12:02;12:03;"It's an experience"
12:03;12:05;"You know, that's contactless"
12:05;12:07;"As soon as I walk out of the theater"
12:07;12:10;"I'm not saddled with the machinery of the film"
12:10;12:11;"I'm not finding much"
12:11;12:13;"but I feel like there must be somebody on eBay"
12:13;12:15;"who's just like, ""OK, this is what I'm looking for"""
12:15;12:19;"Just selling like a ton of DVDs"
12:19;12:22;"Seinfeld, I have a Blu-ray player you could borrow"
12:22;12:25;"So I drive to your place"
12:25;12:26;"I borrow a DVD"
12:26;12:29;"I then order the film from wherever"
12:29;12:30;"It's a lot of work"
12:30;12:32;"It's a lot of legwork"
12:32;12:33;"You know what this makes me think of"
12:33;12:35;"with David Lynch"
12:35;12:37;"trying to prohibit his movies from streaming"
12:37;12:40;"is Garth Brooks"
12:40;12:42;"Garth Brooks does not have his music"
12:42;12:44;"on streaming services"
12:44;12:46;"He's like one of the last big holdouts"
12:46;12:48;"Did you guys watch that doc?"
12:48;12:50;"No, you were saying that that's good"
12:50;12:51;"I gotta check that out"
12:51;12:52;"Amazing"
12:52;12:54;"Wow, he's something else"
12:54;12:56;"I've been fascinated by him"
12:56;12:58;"when I've seen his little videos here and there"
12:58;12:59;"his little social media posts"
12:59;13:02;"He seems like a very intense guy"
13:02;13:04;"How familiar are you with his music, Jake?"
13:04;13:06;"It was interesting to watch this doc"
13:06;13:07;"because I was sort of like"
13:07;13:09;"""Well, I know 'Friends on Low Places'"
13:09;13:11;"and after that I couldn't think of a single song"""
13:11;13:13;"And I was like, ""Well, maybe there'll be some others"
13:13;13:14;"that I recognize"""
13:14;13:15;"And there weren't"
13:15;13:17;"You know one Garth Brooks song"
13:17;13:19;"But he's like the biggest selling artist"
13:19;13:21;"Wait, what was it?"
13:21;13:23;"There was some screenshot I took of it"
13:23;13:24;"that blew my mind"
13:24;13:25;"It was like"
13:25;13:27;"The biggest selling solo male artist"
13:27;13:29;"in US history?"
13:29;13:30;"Some book cooking happening"
13:30;13:31;"But yeah, it was something like"
13:31;13:34;"the biggest selling solo artist"
13:34;13:35;"like more than Michael Jackson"
13:35;13:36;"more than Elvis"
13:36;13:37;"More than Springsteen"
13:37;13:39;"Oh my god, yeah"
13:39;13:41;"Garth Brooks just crushes Bruce"
13:41;13:43;"It was like over 100 million records or something"
13:43;13:45;"Yeah, I know he's massive"
13:45;13:47;"It feels like not that long ago"
13:47;13:48;"It could have been 10, 15 years ago"
13:48;13:51;"But I'm pretty sure he sold out Yankee Stadium"
13:51;13:54;"Dude, he played to a million people in Central Park"
13:54;13:55;"Garth did"
13:55;13:58;"Yes, Yankee Stadium is only like 50,000 people"
13:58;14:01;"There was like a free show in Central Park in '97"
14:01;14:03;"This is in the doc"
14:03;14:05;"And they were doing this whole thing"
14:05;14:06;"He was like in his trailer"
14:06;14:06;"and he's all nervous"
14:06;14:09;"He's like, ""I don't know, man, it's New York"""
14:09;14:10;"""Oh, he's fancy New Yorkers"""
14:10;14:13;"""Is anyone going to be there to come check me out?"""
14:13;14:14;"""Little old me?"""
14:14;14:16;"And then he's like, ""I open the trailer door"""
14:16;14:18;"""And I hear the roar of the crowd"""
14:18;14:20;"""They're here for me"""
14:20;14:22;"And then like it was like"
14:22;14:24;"""Wait, no Garth, there's 200,000 people here"""
14:24;14:26;"""Oh no, Garth"""
14:26;14:28;"""There's 300,000"""
14:28;14:29;"""There's 400,000"""
14:29;14:31;"""Garth, there are 600,000 people"""
14:31;14:33;"Like he's just doing this kind of thing"
14:33;14:35;"He's such a ham"
14:35;14:37;"He kind of gives me like L. Ron Hubbard vibes a little bit"
14:37;14:41;"Garth Brooks has sold the most albums in the world"
14:41;14:42;"Of anybody?"
14:42;14:43;"Of anybody"
14:43;14:46;"He's the highest selling recording artist of all time"
14:46;14:49;"It's like peak CD sale"
14:49;14:49;"Like what do they say?"
14:49;14:53;"Like '98 or '99 was the peak of the record industry"
14:53;14:55;"1999, that was the peak"
14:55;14:57;"The close of the 20th century"
14:57;14:58;"It's like perfect"
14:58;15:01;"My familiarity with Garth Brooks' really intense demeanor comes from"
15:01;15:03;"This video that a friend showed me"
15:03;15:05;"This was probably 4 or 5 years ago"
15:05;15:08;"It's kind of like germane to what we're talking about because"
15:08;15:10;"It's also Garth Brooks like"
15:10;15:13;"Hesitantly stepping into a new arena"
15:13;15:14;"Right"
15:14;15:15;"And this is him"
15:15;15:17;"Posting his first video to Facebook"
15:17;15:20;"Probably when he first launched an official page"
15:20;15:23;"After not being part of it for, you know"
15:23;15:24;"The early rise of social media"
15:24;15:27;"So let's listen to this because this is a very classic video"
15:27;15:29;"Well I guess it's official"
15:29;15:31;"We're now on Facebook"
15:31;15:33;"I really wasn't sure about this at the start"
15:33;15:36;"But then a friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense"
15:36;15:40;"She said, ""Think of it more as a conversation"""
15:40;15:41;"I like that"
15:41;15:43;"But I'm already finding out on my own"
15:43;15:46;"So it's wiping the walls out between you and me"
15:46;15:47;"And I really like that"
15:47;15:48;"I really like that"
15:48;15:52;"It allows us into each other's worlds or I guess in my case"
15:52;15:54;"Hotel room"
15:54;15:56;"When I think about things I want to post"
15:56;15:57;"I want to post cool stuff"
15:57;16:00;"Slick stuff, neat stuff"
16:00;16:03;"But most of the stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw stuff like this"
16:03;16:04;"Super raw"
16:04;16:06;"This is just who I am"
16:06;16:07;"Raw indeed"
16:07;16:09;"So if this is truly a conversation"
16:09;16:10;"No it's not"
16:10;16:12;"Then I say let the conversation begin"
16:12;16:13;"Oh my god this guy drives me up the wall"
16:13;16:14;"There's something about"
16:14;16:17;"[Laughter]"
16:17;16:19;"You said that Garth Brooks drives you up the wall?"
16:19;16:21;"Yeah so the doc is a lot like that"
16:21;16:24;"Except he's weeping through half of the doc"
16:24;16:26;"He's got a little bit of like in that clip"
16:26;16:28;"Like super villain energy"
16:28;16:30;"His cadence is real like"
16:30;16:32;"Bad guy from a movie"
16:32;16:34;"Yeah I like that"
16:34;16:36;"And I really like that"
16:36;16:38;"I want to post slick stuff, raw stuff"
16:38;16:40;"Wait so Jake why does he drive you up the wall?"
16:40;16:43;"What's the phrase? Do you say he drives you up a wall or the wall?"
16:43;16:45;"I say the, he drives me up the wall"
16:45;16:47;"I guess a is better"
16:47;16:49;"Garth Brooks drives you up the wall?"
16:49;16:50;"He drives me up the wall in this doc"
16:50;16:51;"I mean I didn't know anything"
16:51;16:53;"I didn't know much about him"
16:53;16:55;"I hadn't really seen him before this doc"
16:55;16:57;"I mean in terms of being interviewed"
16:57;16:58;"He's just like acting"
16:58;17:02;"It's not like he's giving like a candid interview"
17:02;17:03;"The whole thing is a performance of like"
17:03;17:06;"I'm being so candid and like real with you"
17:06;17:07;"But the whole thing is"
17:07;17:09;"It's so self conscious"
17:09;17:11;"And then he'll frequently break down into tears"
17:11;17:15;"Like recalling like an early gig where like"
17:15;17:19;"You know I was playing at a college bar in Oklahoma"
17:19;17:22;"And I couldn't believe the reaction I got"
17:22;17:27;"And I just knew that music was my life"
17:27;17:30;"It's just like dude whatever like"
17:30;17:31;"He's playing"
17:31;17:34;"It's just like the most banal stories"
17:34;17:36;"That result in him like tearing up"
17:36;17:38;"The guys in his band tear up a lot too"
17:38;17:41;"It's like these very like weepy"
17:41;17:42;"Doughy guys"
17:42;17:43;"It's just like"
17:43;17:44;"It's okay to cry"
17:44;17:48;"Is this just Garth not living up to your standards of machismo?"
17:48;17:53;"It's Garth being a transparently fraudulent dude"
17:53;17:54;"Like it's just like"
17:54;17:56;"If you're gonna cry man"
17:56;17:57;"You gotta like"
17:57;17:58;"You bust it out for one moment"
17:58;18:01;"Like where like your dad dies or something"
18:01;18:02;"You can't"
18:02;18:04;"It's literally crying through half the doc"
18:04;18:05;"It's truly insane"
18:05;18:07;"That could be a good title for something"
18:07;18:10;"The transparently fraudulent tears of Garth Brooks"
18:10;18:13;"Like a George Saunders short story"
18:13;18:16;"A collection of poetry by Jake Longstreet"
18:16;18:19;"A series of haikus"
18:19;18:21;"Well yeah cause when you're describing it"
18:21;18:22;"It is like"
18:22;18:23;"Of course"
18:23;18:27;"Somebody who's moved by emotion to cry"
18:27;18:28;"That can be a very beautiful thing"
18:28;18:31;"Sometimes people who cry are very in touch with their emotions"
18:31;18:32;"Sure"
18:32;18:34;"But you're right that the"
18:34;18:36;"And I mean you see this discussed quite a bit"
18:36;18:38;"These days online is a"
18:38;18:40;"You know when tears are manipulative"
18:40;18:41;"Yeah hard to diag"
18:41;18:42;"You can't diagnose the guy"
18:42;18:45;"If they're performing on a documentary"
18:45;18:46;"But it did seem"
18:46;18:49;"The whole thing seemed very calculated"
18:49;18:50;"Very cloying"
18:50;18:52;"I mean it was fascinating to watch"
18:52;18:54;"Like I said it reminded me of L. Ron Hubbard"
18:54;18:57;"Cause he has this smooth kind of delivery"
18:57;18:58;"And it's just like"
18:58;18:59;"Do you even believe what you're saying man"
18:59;19:01;"Like that kind of thing"
19:01;19:03;"He's probably in too deep to know"
19:03;19:04;"Right and I was also picturing like"
19:04;19:06;"The guys in his band and his friends"
19:06;19:08;"Just like hating him at this point"
19:08;19:11;"Like there'd be like early footage of them playing gigs in the 80s"
19:11;19:12;"And it'd be like"
19:12;19:13;"Oh this is cool"
19:13;19:14;"Like bar band and like"
19:14;19:16;"It's everyone's young and they're playing like"
19:16;19:19;"And then like he's been with the same musicians for like"
19:19;19:20;"Decades and"
19:20;19:21;"Everyone's like in this like"
19:21;19:24;"Beautiful like sterile recording studio"
19:24;19:25;"Doing these like very like"
19:25;19:27;"Intense taping sessions and I'm"
19:27;19:30;"I'm just picturing those guys just like eye rolling"
19:30;19:32;"Like as soon as the camera stops"
19:32;19:34;"I could be totally wrong but I mean"
19:34;19:34;"I don't know"
19:34;19:37;"We're gonna get an angry email from"
19:37;19:39;"Garth Brooks' bassist"
19:39;19:40;"Just being like"
19:40;19:42;"How dare you"
19:42;19:43;"That's my guy"
19:43;19:44;"We weep together"
19:44;19:47;"Garth Brooks is also interesting because he kind of um"
19:47;19:49;"I'm sure other people were involved but"
19:49;19:50;"He really"
19:50;19:51;"More than anybody else"
19:51;19:55;"Invented the modern country superstar vibe"
19:55;19:57;"Like he is that transitional moment"
19:57;19:58;"From the 80s to the 90s"
19:58;20:01;"Where of course there are always big country stars"
20:01;20:04;"And I'm sure like in any genre"
20:04;20:06;"Sometimes the biggest stars"
20:06;20:08;"Are a little bizarre because they live in a"
20:08;20:09;"In a weird bubble"
20:09;20:09;"Yeah"
20:09;20:11;"He was like the first like"
20:11;20:13;"Modern slick stadium"
20:13;20:14;"Country dude"
20:14;20:16;"Well the latest news from Nashville"
20:16;20:19;"Ain't all good but it ain't bad"
20:19;20:21;"The worst I ever found there"
20:21;20:24;"Was the best I ever had"
20:24;20:26;"The new hats and the no hats"
20:26;20:27;"Are still coming on pretty strong"
20:27;20:30;"While me and Chris and John and Willie"
20:30;20:32;"Keep plodding right along"
20:32;20:35;"Clint Black's moved out to Hollywood"
20:35;20:37;"He's in love and that's a fact"
20:37;20:39;"Dunn found himself a movie star"
20:39;20:42;"Gonna show him how to act"
20:42;20:44;"Garth Brooks keeps selling millions"
20:44;20:46;"That show ain't no joke"
20:46;20:48;"But I can't help but keep on looking"
20:48;20:50;"For a pig down in the pole"
20:50;20:52;"On a totally different note"
20:52;20:54;"We got a major guest coming up today"
20:54;20:55;"Which is Bruce Hornsby"
20:55;20:57;"But before we set him up"
20:57;20:58;"I just had something that I actually made a note"
20:58;21:00;"That I wanted to discuss today"
21:00;21:03;"Because obviously there's so much going on"
21:03;21:03;"And you know"
21:03;21:05;"We're back to bi-weekly now"
21:05;21:06;"It's hard to even stay on top of"
21:06;21:08;"Everything that's going on"
21:08;21:11;"But I had a conversation with a friend recently"
21:11;21:12;"And I didn't want to do any research"
21:12;21:13;"I thought maybe we could do some live research"
21:13;21:15;"So Seinfeld"
21:15;21:17;"Get your best number crunching tools ready"
21:17;21:19;"So I was talking to my buddy Andre"
21:19;21:20;"Who I've known for a long time"
21:20;21:22;"We grew up in the same town"
21:22;21:24;"He was telling me about"
21:24;21:26;"How he used to work in a bike shop in New York"
21:26;21:28;"And that his boss"
21:28;21:30;"Was a fanatic for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups"
21:30;21:32;"And he said"
21:32;21:35;"I've never heard this before"
21:35;21:36;"So he said that"
21:36;21:38;"His boss would always be telling him"
21:38;21:40;"To go run to the corner store"
21:40;21:43;"To buy him a thing of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups"
21:43;21:44;"And sometimes he would eat it"
21:44;21:46;"But other times"
21:46;21:47;"He would be very disturbed"
21:47;21:48;"He'd like take one bite and say"
21:48;21:49;"You can have the rest of it"
21:49;21:51;"You could have like the other one in the package"
21:51;21:53;"And Andre would be like"
21:53;21:54;"What's wrong with it?"
21:54;21:56;"And that he"
21:56;21:57;"He would say"
21:57;21:58;"This one's a summer edition"
21:58;22:00;"I guess the first time Andre was just like"
22:00;22:00;"What?"
22:00;22:01;"And he was like"
22:01;22:03;"Yeah, they're still selling the summer editions"
22:03;22:05;"They didn't get the winter editions yet"
22:05;22:06;"And Andre's like"
22:06;22:08;"Uh, the packaging is the same"
22:08;22:10;"He's like it doesn't say on the packaging"
22:10;22:11;"But they taste so different"
22:11;22:12;"In the summer"
22:12;22:14;"They do a summer edition"
22:14;22:15;"And it's got different chemicals in it"
22:15;22:17;"So it doesn't melt"
22:17;22:17;"But then in the winter"
22:17;22:19;"They go back to the normal formula"
22:19;22:21;"And I hate it that even once the weather changes"
22:21;22:23;"And you know it's November or December"
22:23;22:24;"Certain stores"
22:24;22:25;"Because they didn't sell it in the summer edition"
22:25;22:26;"They still have them"
22:26;22:27;"And it's very frustrating"
22:27;22:29;"When you're trying to get a winter edition"
22:29;22:31;"I'd never heard of this in my life"
22:31;22:33;"So I just made a note"
22:33;22:35;"I didn't do any research of course"
22:35;22:36;"In TC fashion"
22:36;22:37;"But I was like"
22:37;22:38;"Either"
22:38;22:40;"The boss is just like"
22:40;22:41;"Totally nuts"
22:41;22:43;"Has like made up this story in his head"
22:43;22:45;"Or this is like a major bombshell"
22:45;22:46;"Is this a thing?"
22:46;22:48;"That candy bars have different formulas"
22:48;22:50;"In summer and winter"
22:50;22:50;"Well first of all Jake"
22:50;22:52;"Have you ever heard of this in your life?"
22:52;22:52;"Never heard of it"
22:52;22:54;"It's a great urban legend"
22:54;22:56;"I don't buy it"
22:56;22:58;"Maybe it was a thing back in the day"
22:58;22:59;"But Seinfeld, what'd you find?"
22:59;23:01;"First of all let's start with the fact"
23:01;23:03;"That there is some precedent for this"
23:03;23:05;"Apparently in the 1930s"
23:05;23:08;"The Reese Company was unable to make their chocolate"
23:08;23:09;"Because it was too hot"
23:09;23:11;"And they didn't have the proper cooling"
23:11;23:13;"And air conditioning systems"
23:13;23:15;"So what they did is in the winter months"
23:15;23:17;"They turned to a canning company"
23:17;23:20;"They would can beans and tomatoes"
23:20;23:22;"In the months when they couldn't make chocolate"
23:22;23:24;"And then revert back to the chocolate"
23:24;23:26;"When it cooled down"
23:26;23:28;"That's totally insane"
23:28;23:29;"Wait wait so hold on"
23:29;23:31;"They just stopped making chocolate"
23:31;23:32;"In the winter"
23:32;23:33;"Yeah correct"
23:33;23:35;"It was a seasonal confection"
23:35;23:36;"I can believe that in the 30s"
23:36;23:39;"That if you're sending a truck out"
23:39;23:40;"From your factory"
23:40;23:41;"And by the time it gets there"
23:41;23:44;"It's melted and then you got the shop owners"
23:44;23:44;"Calling you angrily"
23:44;23:45;"That's like"
23:45;23:46;"I got this stuff yesterday"
23:46;23:47;"Today it's all a mess"
23:47;23:48;"I can't sell it"
23:48;23:49;"You'd be like alright"
23:49;23:50;"Let's just pause"
23:50;23:53;"But is there anything about"
23:53;23:54;"Did they learn from that"
23:54;23:56;"And start changing the formula?"
23:56;23:58;"So you know I haven't had a ton of time"
23:58;23:59;"To really dig deep here"
23:59;24:01;"But from what I can tell"
24:01;24:03;"According to the first few pages of Google"
24:03;24:06;"There's no different summer recipe"
24:06;24:06;"In the winter"
24:06;24:08;"Unless this is something that's like"
24:08;24:10;"A deep Reese's Secret"
24:10;24:11;"But"
24:11;24:13;"I mean maybe what your friend is talking about"
24:13;24:14;"Is that they have a certain"
24:14;24:15;"Amount of inventory"
24:15;24:17;"That they produce for half the year"
24:17;24:18;"And then maybe it gets a little stale"
24:18;24:21;"Near the end of the season"
24:21;24:23;"And then they refresh it"
24:23;24:25;"But I'm not seeing anything on"
24:25;24:26;"A different recipe"
24:26;24:28;"Based on you know"
24:28;24:29;"Different seasons or anything like that"
24:29;24:32;"Fresh mass produced candy"
24:32;24:35;"Just stuffed with preservatives"
24:35;24:35;"I mean look"
24:35;24:37;"We've all had something that wasn't"
24:37;24:38;"Technically expired"
24:38;24:39;"Like a candy bar"
24:39;24:41;"But just didn't taste that good"
24:41;24:42;"Because"
24:42;24:44;"It was like a little bit old"
24:44;24:45;"Not sure if I have"
24:45;24:46;"You never had like a"
24:46;24:48;"A Nature Valley granola bar"
24:48;24:49;"And just like"
24:49;24:49;"Mmm"
24:49;24:51;"Granola bar is a little different"
24:51;24:53;"I feel like a Snickers and a Reese's"
24:53;24:54;"That kind of stuff"
24:54;24:55;"That's like truly"
24:55;24:56;"Pure chemicals"
24:56;24:58;"You've never had a stale Snickers?"
24:58;25:00;"I don't think so"
25:00;25:01;"And you know I'm eating"
25:01;25:03;"Five or six Snickers a year"
25:03;25:04;"So"
25:04;25:06;"They do have some seasonal"
25:06;25:07;"Reese products that come out around"
25:07;25:08;"Like there's like"
25:08;25:10;"Reese Easter egg"
25:10;25:13;"Which comes out around Easter"
25:13;25:14;"That kind of thing"
25:14;25:15;"But I'm now like seven pages"
25:15;25:16;"Deep into Google"
25:16;25:18;"Not seeing anything like that"
25:18;25:20;"No variance between the recipes"
25:20;25:21;"Depending on what time"
25:21;25:22;"This boss character"
25:22;25:24;"Who's obsessed with Reese's"
25:24;25:24;"Like"
25:24;25:26;"I also like that it's like"
25:26;25:28;"One man's fight for the truth"
25:28;25:29;"It's almost like some"
25:29;25:31;"QAnon conspiracy theory"
25:31;25:31;"Just like"
25:31;25:33;"Showing up at the Reese's factory"
25:33;25:34;"Like"
25:34;25:35;"I'm a journalist"
25:35;25:36;"Holding a camera"
25:36;25:37;"The people have a right to see"
25:37;25:38;"And they're just like"
25:38;25:38;"Sir"
25:38;25:40;"We do not change the formula"
25:40;25:41;"And he's like"
25:41;25:41;"They do"
25:41;25:43;"I know they do"
25:43;25:43;"I mean you know"
25:43;25:44;"It's also kind of like"
25:44;25:47;"Do you guys believe in chemtrails?"
25:47;25:47;"No"
25:47;25:49;"You don't think that none of the"
25:49;25:51;"The lines in the sky made by planes"
25:51;25:53;"Are chemicals that the government's using for"
25:53;25:54;"No"
25:54;25:55;"One reason or another"
25:55;25:56;"Do you believe in it?"
25:56;25:58;"I do believe that planes leave trails"
25:58;26:00;"I kind of remember seeing a video"
26:00;26:02;"A long time ago that was like"
26:02;26:04;"A guy who was just obsessed with chemtrails"
26:04;26:05;"So he'd just be like sitting in his"
26:05;26:06;"Like suburban backyard"
26:06;26:08;"Pointing his like phone at the sky"
26:08;26:09;"And just like"
26:09;26:10;"You would just see like"
26:10;26:11;"What appeared to be"
26:11;26:12;"A regular commercial plane"
26:12;26:14;"Just like zipping across the sky"
26:14;26:16;"Leaving the famous trail"
26:16;26:16;"Yeah"
26:16;26:17;"And this guy would just be"
26:17;26:18;"Like zooming in on it"
26:18;26:19;"And just be like"
26:19;26:21;"You bastards"
26:21;26:22;"Wow"
26:22;26:23;"Oh here comes another one"
26:23;26:25;"You absolute pieces of s***"
26:25;26:26;"Every plane he saw"
26:26;26:28;"He was just kind of like"
26:28;26:29;"Oh man"
26:29;26:30;"Look at all these chemicals"
26:30;26:31;"So of course"
26:31;26:33;"I don't believe that every plane is doing that"
26:33;26:35;"I gotta research it a little more"
26:35;26:37;"I'm not up on the deep parts of the conspiracy theory"
26:37;26:37;"But"
26:37;26:39;"I guess the one thing about it"
26:39;26:41;"That I'm sure there is some precedent for"
26:41;26:42;"Is that"
26:42;26:44;"I think the reason people believe in chemtrails"
26:44;26:46;"Is because"
26:46;26:48;"The idea that the government"
26:48;26:49;"Or some"
26:49;26:50;"The Illuminati"
26:50;26:51;"Or big corporate"
26:51;26:52;"America or something"
26:52;26:54;"Has some reason to put"
26:54;26:55;"Chemicals"
26:55;26:56;"Into the atmosphere"
26:56;26:57;"Obviously there's"
26:57;26:59;"Precedents for that belief system"
26:59;27:00;"Obviously there's like"
27:00;27:01;"Fluoridated water"
27:01;27:02;"In some places"
27:02;27:04;"Sometimes it's for a good reason"
27:04;27:06;"And then you have these dark stories about like"
27:06;27:07;"Big corporations like"
27:07;27:08;"Nestle or something"
27:08;27:09;"Experimenting"
27:09;27:11;"On desperate people"
27:11;27:13;"In a third world country"
27:13;27:14;"Making the women use their formula"
27:14;27:15;"And studying it"
27:15;27:16;"So there's"
27:16;27:18;"The idea that there could be"
27:18;27:20;"Things we don't know"
27:20;27:22;"About what's going into our food"
27:22;27:23;"Or our atmosphere"
27:23;27:25;"I buy that"
27:25;27:26;"So you know maybe there's a"
27:26;27:27;"A bit of healthy skepticism"
27:27;27:30;"In both chemtrail conspiracy theorists"
27:30;27:32;"And Reese's conspiracy theorists"
27:32;27:35;"So you are chemtrail curious"
27:35;27:38;"Are you Reese's winter edition curious?"
27:38;27:40;"I'm convinced that the government"
27:40;27:42;"Puts really bad stuff in Reese's"
27:42;27:43;"In the summer"
27:43;27:45;"Not just to keep them from melting"
27:45;27:46;"But also to control our minds"
27:46;27:48;"So I believe that"
27:48;27:49;"And I believe there's a"
27:49;27:51;"There's a dude in Brooklyn who has"
27:51;27:53;"Such an advanced palate"
27:53;27:53;"You can tell"
27:53;27:55;"But truthfully"
27:55;27:56;"He might have a very advanced palate"
27:56;27:58;"And maybe it is just that he"
27:58;28:01;"Can tell when a Reese's has been sitting"
28:01;28:03;"At the corner store for"
28:03;28:05;"Two weeks versus two months"
28:05;28:06;"I'm willing to believe that"
28:06;28:08;"And that he might"
28:08;28:09;"Somebody told him once"
28:09;28:10;"Oh yeah it's because there's different editions"
28:10;28:11;"And now he just"
28:11;28:12;"He assumes when he bites in"
28:12;28:14;"It tastes kind of funny that that's why"
28:14;28:16;"So you know in that sense he's not"
28:16;28:17;"Wrong"
28:17;28:18;"That something's different"
28:18;28:19;"It might just be"
28:19;28:20;"Nature"
28:20;28:21;"It just might be all father time"
28:21;28:23;"A Reese's peanut butter cup"
28:23;28:25;"Has a shelf life"
28:25;28:27;"Of about nine to twelve months"
28:27;28:28;"Well that's pretty crazy"
28:28;28:30;"To imagine that you could be going to a store"
28:30;28:32;"You could be eating one that's a day old"
28:32;28:33;"You could be eating one that's"
28:33;28:34;"Twelve months old"
28:34;28:35;"That's a big difference"
28:35;28:37;"I wonder"
28:37;28:38;"Where they're manufactured"
28:38;28:39;"If there's only like one place"
28:39;28:40;"That manufactures them"
28:40;28:42;"There are several plants"
28:42;28:43;"There's one in Ashland"
28:43;28:45;"Lancaster, PA, Hazleton"
28:45;28:46;"Memphis"
28:46;28:46;"Uh"
28:46;28:48;"Hershey"
28:48;28:50;"Robinson, Illinois"
28:50;28:51;"Any West Coast?"
28:51;28:52;"Oregon"
28:52;28:53;"There's Ashland, Oregon"
28:53;28:55;"There you go"
28:55;28:56;"That's your West Coast distro"
28:56;28:59;"Well if anybody has any info about this"
28:59;29:02;"Conspiracy theory or just personal experience"
29:02;29:02;"Please let us know"
29:02;29:04;"Because I would love to get to the bottom of this"
29:04;29:06;"I'm not entirely convinced that this man"
29:06;29:07;"Is not correct"
29:07;29:09;"There's a little something more going on"
29:09;29:11;"In the Reese's universe"
29:11;29:13;"Alright Jake we got a true legend"
29:13;29:14;"Coming on the show"
29:14;29:15;"I know this is crazy"
29:15;29:17;"This is a really big one"
29:17;29:19;"We're gonna be talking to Bruce Hornsby"
29:19;29:20;"Of course"
29:20;29:22;"He barely needs an introduction"
29:22;29:24;"I'm sure everybody at the bare minimum"
29:24;29:26;"Knows his song ""The Way It Is"""
29:26;29:28;"Which was a big hit in the 80's"
29:28;29:31;"Introduced to a whole new generation via Tupac"
29:31;29:32;"In the late 90's"
29:32;29:34;"A posthumously released song called ""Changes"""
29:34;29:36;"So he's done amazing work solo"
29:36;29:39;"With his albums he put out with his band The Range"
29:39;29:41;"And then of course he played over 100 shows"
29:41;29:42;"With The Dead"
29:42;29:46;"So he's a big part of the Grateful Dead universe"
29:46;29:48;"He's got a new album coming out that has"
29:48;29:50;"A friend of the show Justin Vernon"
29:50;29:52;"Jamila Woods"
29:52;29:52;"Leon Russell"
29:52;29:54;"And Vernon Reed"
29:54;29:55;"From Living Color"
29:55;29:58;"He just dropped a single with James Mercer from The Shins"
29:58;30:00;"It's a very cool song"
30:00;30:02;"He's been doing it for decades"
30:02;30:05;"Now Justin Vernon really introduced Bruce Hornsby"
30:05;30:06;"To a whole new generation"
30:06;30:06;"Because Justin"
30:06;30:08;"I think he talked about it when he came on Time Crisis"
30:08;30:10;"He's a massive fan"
30:10;30:12;"And if you listen to the Boney Vera albums"
30:12;30:14;"At least the second and third ones"
30:14;30:15;"And the fourth"
30:15;30:17;"When Justin shouts at Bruce Hornsby"
30:17;30:20;"He's not just being like ""Oh no, he's a great pianist and songwriter"""
30:20;30:22;"Bruce Hornsby is a fundamental"
30:22;30:25;"He's a cornerstone of Justin's music"
30:25;30:25;"Yeah"
30:25;30:26;"In a huge way"
30:26;30:26;"But anyway"
30:26;30:27;"Even before"
30:27;30:29;"I guess Justin's a lifelong fan"
30:29;30:31;"But even before he kind of introduced"
30:31;30:33;"Yet another generation to Bruce"
30:33;30:36;"Jake, I feel like you were flying the flag way back in the day"
30:36;30:38;"You've been a longtime fan, right?"
30:38;30:39;"I guess so, yeah"
30:39;30:40;"I mean, I just, you know"
30:40;30:41;"I'd always"
30:41;30:42;"Like I'd heard the songs"
30:42;30:44;"""Mandolin Rain"" and"
30:44;30:47;"The way it is on the radio and just was like"
30:47;30:48;"Always loved him"
30:48;30:51;"Bought the first record years ago"
30:51;30:52;"Always had it"
30:52;30:55;"I never like checked out his work before that"
30:55;30:58;"But yeah, I just always thought it was like incredibly"
30:58;31:01;"Melodic, beautiful playing and great songwriting"
31:01;31:03;"And I always was a fan, yeah"
31:03;31:05;"I guess maybe when I was, you know, into it"
31:05;31:06;"Like whatever that was"
31:06;31:08;"15, 20 years ago"
31:08;31:08;"It was like"
31:08;31:10;"Seen as sort of like"
31:10;31:11;"Cheesy, like adult"
31:11;31:13;"Kind of soft rock or something"
31:13;31:15;"You know how people would like clown on like"
31:15;31:17;"Phil Collins 20 years ago?"
31:17;31:17;"Yo, totally"
31:17;31:18;"Even though his music"
31:18;31:21;"Obviously, as a musician and a piano player"
31:21;31:23;"It's just on another level"
31:23;31:24;"But I think a big part of that"
31:24;31:27;"Which is something we've discussed on the show before is like"
31:27;31:29;"In the 90s"
31:29;31:32;"The 90s was actually one of the harshest decades in a way"
31:32;31:35;"Because people hated on the previous decades so hard"
31:35;31:35;"Right"
31:35;31:37;"It's not like now in 2020"
31:37;31:38;"People are like"
31:38;31:40;"Of course, there's always gonna be this awkward time"
31:40;31:41;"When people are like"
31:41;31:44;"Feel a little bit funny about things that came out 10 years ago"
31:44;31:46;"Because it's like the uncanny valley"
31:46;31:48;"But you don't have that same kind of just like"
31:48;31:50;"Oh my god"
31:50;31:51;"The 2000s were pathetic"
31:51;31:53;"The 2010s ruled"
31:53;31:56;"But in the 90s, there really was this like hatred of like"
31:56;31:58;"Some of the synth tones of the 80s"
31:58;32:01;"And you know, Bruce Hornby came out in the 80s"
32:01;32:04;"So his music is very idiosyncratic but it"
32:04;32:05;"Of course, it sounds like the 80s"
32:05;32:06;"So I think in some ways"
32:06;32:08;"A lot of artists from the 80s"
32:08;32:11;"Especially ones that had like a mellower sound"
32:11;32:13;"Or had moments of like soft rock"
32:13;32:15;"It was seen as like deeply uncool compared to like"
32:15;32:18;"I don't know, like bargain bin grunge music"
32:18;32:19;"From the next decade"
32:19;32:20;"And it probably took like"
32:20;32:21;"Other people to be like"
32:21;32:22;"Wait, what are you talking about?"
32:22;32:25;"This is like excellent American music"
32:25;32:26;"And especially when you really look at it"
32:26;32:28;"It's such a cool mix of"
32:28;32:29;"Americana"
32:29;32:31;"A little bit of jam"
32:31;32:33;"Cutting edge 80s production"
32:33;32:35;"It's really fascinating music"
32:35;32:37;"Like some bluegrass sort of"
32:37;32:37;"Yeah"
32:37;32:40;"It's like truly Americana meets 80s"
32:40;32:41;"Well, talking about his 80s work"
32:41;32:43;"At least the first two big albums"
32:43;32:44;"Well, anyway"
32:44;32:45;"Let's talk to the man himself"
32:45;32:47;"Can we get Bruce Hornsby on the horn?"
32:47;32:56;"Oh, hey, Bruce?"
32:56;32:57;"Yeah, yeah"
32:57;32:58;"Oh, hey, how are you doing, man?"
32:58;32:59;"Sucking too bad"
32:59;33:01;"Oh, cool, I'm Ezra"
33:01;33:02;"This is my co-host Jake"
33:02;33:03;"Welcome to Time Crisis"
33:03;33:04;"Hey"
33:04;33:05;"Jake and I are both big fans"
33:05;33:07;"And we're very honored to have you on the show"
33:07;33:09;"So where are you calling from?"
33:09;33:11;"Williamsburg, Virginia, the colonial tourist town"
33:11;33:14;"You may have been dragged there in seventh grade"
33:14;33:16;"On a school field trip"
33:16;33:18;"Could have been the local townies"
33:18;33:19;"Helping you with water balloons"
33:19;33:22;"That was our self-appointed job"
33:22;33:23;"When we grew up in this town"
33:23;33:25;"So Williamsburg, Virginia"
33:25;33:26;"That's your hometown"
33:26;33:27;"Yeah, I grew up here"
33:27;33:29;"And I went away to school"
33:29;33:30;"I did a little bit of school hopping"
33:30;33:32;"I started at University of Richmond"
33:32;33:34;"Just an hour away from here"
33:34;33:38;"But it was one year of normal college"
33:38;33:41;"Enough for me to realize that I wanted to cast my light"
33:41;33:43;"Unequivocally with the musos"
33:43;33:45;"Much to the chagrin of my parents"
33:45;33:47;"Who made me, he said, ""Okay, well"
33:47;33:48;"If you want to do this, you pay for it"""
33:48;33:50;"And so I did, and I"
33:50;33:52;"Then I went to Berklee College of Music in Boston"
33:52;33:55;"And then finished my last two years at the U of M"
33:55;33:57;"Suntan U"
33:57;33:58;"University of Miami"
33:58;34:01;"And that was a great experience for me"
34:01;34:04;"And then came back home and started a band"
34:04;34:08;"And we got discovered and we moved to L.A. in 1980"
34:08;34:11;"I lived in L.A. for 10 years, 80 to 90"
34:11;34:13;"And then came back here in 1990"
34:13;34:14;"And that's it"
34:14;34:16;"My next move is into a pine box"
34:16;34:17;"Heavy"
34:17;34:18;"Well, at least"
34:18;34:19;"It did, it did"
34:19;34:20;"Okay"
34:20;34:25;"At least you'll be underneath the green, green grass at home"
34:25;34:27;"Yes, that's right"
34:27;34:28;"That's absolutely right"
34:28;34:31;"It's interesting that, yeah, you lived in L.A. for a decade"
34:31;34:33;"But made it out of the jungle"
34:33;34:34;"I did, yes"
34:34;34:35;"That's right"
34:35;34:36;"It's a"
34:36;34:39;"And tried to find some property like we did"
34:39;34:41;"Away from people as, you know, as I get older"
34:41;34:43;"I'm increasingly misanthropic"
34:43;34:46;"And so I like living out in the woods"
34:46;34:47;"It's just"
34:47;34:48;"It's just great for me"
34:48;34:53;"But look, L.A. for me was a necessary place to be"
34:53;34:54;"And I learned a lot out there"
34:54;34:57;"I came out there and realized what good was"
34:57;34:59;"Because around here in Virginia"
34:59;35:01;"There's some good music going on"
35:01;35:02;"But nothing like out there"
35:02;35:06;"And so I just got a sense of what good is"
35:06;35:09;"So it helped me and kept on going"
35:09;35:13;"And was fortunate enough to get something going out there"
35:13;35:16;"So you already gave us some of like the rough biography"
35:16;35:17;"Yeah, yeah"
35:17;35:19;"Why don't you take us to the early days of The Range"
35:19;35:24;"How that came together and kind of moving into your first album"
35:24;35:25;"Well we ate a lot of junk food"
35:25;35:26;"I hear you guys like to talk about that"
35:26;35:27;"So I'll throw that in there"
35:27;35:28;"Oh definitely"
35:28;35:30;"Mid-80s, Bruce Horn is being The Range"
35:30;35:32;"What were you guys snacking on?"
35:32;35:33;"Carl's Jr."
35:33;35:34;"Okay"
35:34;35:35;"It's a big burger"
35:35;35:37;"You know, an in-and-out burger"
35:37;35:38;"Carl's Jr."
35:38;35:39;"The East Coast"
35:39;35:40;"Aren't you guys a little bit from the East?"
35:40;35:41;"Yeah, actually"
35:41;35:42;"I grew up in Jersey"
35:42;35:43;"And Jake's from Connecticut"
35:43;35:45;"So yeah, we're both out here"
35:45;35:47;"Mostly in California these days"
35:47;35:48;"But definitely East Coast guys"
35:48;35:50;"Okay, so you know Carl's Jr."
35:50;35:52;"Is the West Coast version of Hardee's"
35:52;35:53;"At least that's my impression"
35:53;35:54;"Yes"
35:54;35:55;"All the same branding"
35:55;35:57;"And basically the same menu"
35:57;35:58;"Yeah, I think that's true"
35:58;35:59;"Yeah"
35:59;36:00;"The one-third pound thick burger"
36:00;36:03;"Is something that can really clog a vein"
36:03;36:04;"But I'm not against it"
36:04;36:07;"I just remember going to Carl's Jr."
36:07;36:10;"One time with my guitar player Pete Harris"
36:10;36:13;"I drove this funky-ass old station wagon"
36:13;36:14;"And I never washed it"
36:14;36:17;"And it was just a wreck"
36:17;36:18;"And I walk in"
36:18;36:20;"And we'd kind of gotten ourselves going"
36:20;36:22;"Fairly strongly on our first record at that time"
36:22;36:24;"We're going to Carl's Jr."
36:24;36:25;"Taking a break from rehearsal"
36:25;36:27;"And then I go back to the car"
36:27;36:29;"Where some guy accosts me and says"
36:29;36:32;"""Oh, come on man, you can do better than that"""
36:32;36:34;"He just recognized you?"
36:34;36:35;"I guess he did, yeah"
36:35;36:36;"I guess he did"
36:36;36:37;"And then he saw me get into this jalopy"
36:37;36:41;"Because cars have never been that heavily"
36:41;36:42;"Gave us rats about"
36:42;36:45;"But that's just why I think of Carl's Jr."
36:45;36:47;"Because that was just a funny little moment"
36:47;36:48;"Little vignette"
36:48;36:50;"There's a guy somewhere"
36:50;36:51;"Just telling people"
36:51;36:52;"Like, once in the mid-80s"
36:52;36:56;"I saw Bruce Willis be rolling into a Carl's Jr."
36:56;36:58;"Then he got in his f***ing car"
36:58;36:59;"It was just sad, man"
36:59;37:04;"With his old, old Cutlass '98 station wagon, yeah"
37:04;37:05;"So one question I have for you"
37:05;37:06;"Because we're going to ask you a lot of questions"
37:06;37:08;"About The Grateful Dead shortly"
37:08;37:10;"But you're born in '54"
37:10;37:13;"So you're in your late 20s, early 30s"
37:13;37:14;"Around this era of"
37:14;37:16;"You're in LA"
37:16;37:20;"And know that you'd been a big fan of The Dead previously"
37:20;37:21;"Yeah"
37:21;37:22;"And then we'll talk about you"
37:22;37:23;"Actually playing with them later"
37:23;37:24;"But so at this point"
37:24;37:25;"You're somebody who's been interested"
37:25;37:26;"In I'm sure a lot of music"
37:26;37:29;"But certainly jazz and The Dead and Americana"
37:29;37:30;"Yeah"
37:30;37:31;"But you're from a different generation"
37:31;37:32;"Than those guys"
37:32;37:34;"So when I'm picturing you in LA"
37:34;37:38;"1980 to '84"
37:38;37:39;"For me, when I picture LA then"
37:39;37:43;"I'm picturing really big-time slick"
37:43;37:44;"Record business music"
37:44;37:45;"Yeah"
37:45;37:46;"I'm also picturing just like"
37:46;37:47;"Black Flag and X"
37:47;37:49;"And punk and hardcore"
37:49;37:50;"And kind of Repo Man vibes"
37:50;37:52;"So I guess I'm curious"
37:52;37:55;"What scene did you see yourself in?"
37:55;37:56;"Well I'd say probably"
37:56;37:58;"I would fit in with the"
37:58;38:01;"Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter crowd"
38:01;38:05;"You know, the Jackson Brown, CSN"
38:05;38:08;"Warren Zvon, Tom Petty"
38:08;38:10;"You mentioned Americana"
38:10;38:12;"So those, they were sort of tangential"
38:12;38:13;"To what's called Americana"
38:13;38:15;"All those people are like minimum"
38:15;38:17;"You know, five to ten years older than you"
38:17;38:19;"You're like the young dude"
38:19;38:20;"Kind of in the mix?"
38:20;38:22;"Well at first I couldn't get arrested"
38:22;38:24;"At first I was just some sad sack"
38:24;38:26;"Out there playing on publishing demos"
38:26;38:27;"Just to pay the rent"
38:27;38:29;"I was a staff songwriter"
38:29;38:31;"For 20th Century Fox"
38:31;38:32;"It sounds like a big deal"
38:32;38:33;"But it really wasn't"
38:33;38:36;"It was kind of a B-team publishing company"
38:36;38:38;"And they thought I was going to get signed"
38:38;38:40;"And all that business"
38:40;38:42;"Lenny Warren, the great Lenny Warren"
38:42;38:43;"Kurt Warner Brothers"
38:43;38:46;"Gave me some demo money in '82"
38:46;38:49;"But he just ended up passing what we gave him"
38:49;38:50;"And he was right"
38:50;38:52;"I really wasn't ready then"
38:52;38:54;"So when I started rubbing shoulders"
38:54;38:57;"With that crowd that I was mentioning"
38:57;38:58;"Well that was after"
38:58;39:00;"You know, first record came out in '86"
39:00;39:03;"And then that went pretty far pretty fast"
39:03;39:05;"And then these people started to know me"
39:05;39:07;"And asked me to do things for them"
39:07;39:09;"Probably about '88"
39:09;39:10;"And then on and on"
39:10;39:13;"So then starting from about '89"
39:13;39:14;"You know I was getting calls"
39:14;39:15;"From Don Henley to write"
39:15;39:16;"And we wrote that song"
39:16;39:17;"End of the Innocents"
39:17;39:19;"And then I started getting calls"
39:19;39:20;"To play on people's records"
39:20;39:22;"And man that was amazing"
39:22;39:24;"I just got to jump into"
39:24;39:25;"Different people's worlds"
39:25;39:28;"Who I, iconic artist's worlds"
39:28;39:29;"Who I loved"
39:29;39:31;"It was sort of like painting yourself"
39:31;39:32;"Into the mural that you were looking at"
39:32;39:35;"The poster that you had on your wall"
39:35;39:36;"And so I wrote a song"
39:36;39:37;"With Robbie Robertson"
39:37;39:38;"For one of his records"
39:38;39:40;"And then played on a Dylan record"
39:40;39:42;"And a Bob Seger record"
39:42;39:43;"And the Bonnie Raitt record"
39:43;39:44;"That's so well known"
39:44;39:45;"So when I started hanging out with him"
39:45;39:48;"Yes there was a clear"
39:48;39:49;"Little brother vibe"
39:49;39:50;"I guess you could say"
39:50;39:51;"From them toward me"
39:51;39:54;"But it was very warm"
39:54;39:56;"And embracing"
39:56;39:59;"And so I guess you would say"
39:59;40:00;"I was trying to be"
40:00;40:03;"Sort of an American rocker"
40:03;40:08;"You know, Cougar, Petty, Springsteen"
40:08;40:09;"That kind of thing"
40:09;40:11;"But when I started playing piano"
40:11;40:12;"Getting a little more"
40:12;40:14;"Of the jazz influence"
40:14;40:15;"Of my piano playing"
40:15;40:17;"Into the music on the first record"
40:17;40:19;"That's what actually sort of"
40:19;40:21;"Made it seem a little more special"
40:21;40:22;"Than just another guy"
40:22;40:23;"Applying his trade"
40:23;40:26;"With some guitars and B3s"
40:26;40:27;"Standing in line"
40:27;40:28;"Marking time"
40:28;40:32;"Waiting for the welfare dime"
40:32;40:35;"'Cause they can't buy a job"
40:35;40:36;"A man in a silk suit"
40:36;40:37;"Hurries by as he catches"
40:37;40:40;"The paw on the lady's eyes"
40:40;40:42;"Just for fun he says"
40:42;40:46;"Get a job"
40:46;40:50;"That's just the way it is"
40:50;40:55;"Some things will never change"
40:55;40:59;"That's just the way it is"
40:59;41:02;"Ah, but don't you believe them"
41:02;41:04;"So let's talk about The Dead a bit"
41:04;41:06;"Because you had a"
41:06;41:08;"Kind of like a dead cover band"
41:08;41:09;"When you were growing up"
41:09;41:10;"Well actually I didn't"
41:10;41:12;"I was not a"
41:12;41:13;"When I started playing the piano"
41:13;41:16;"I started playing late, age 17"
41:16;41:17;"And I got into it"
41:17;41:18;"'Cause my older brother"
41:18;41:20;"Was the real muse of the family"
41:20;41:22;"'Cause I was more of a jock at the time"
41:22;41:24;"Kind of like the Justin Vernon"
41:24;41:26;"Of Williamsburg, Virginia, you know"
41:26;41:27;"Right, and you were"
41:27;41:28;"In sports basketball"
41:28;41:29;"Exactly, so"
41:29;41:31;"He got me into Elton John"
41:31;41:32;"And Leon Russell"
41:32;41:33;"And that got me into the piano"
41:33;41:35;"And it came pretty naturally for me"
41:35;41:36;"I played guitar"
41:36;41:38;"Had little bands in sixth grade, seventh grade"
41:38;41:39;"Battled the bands, winners"
41:39;41:40;"And mostly we won"
41:40;41:42;"Because we had my older brothers"
41:42;41:44;"Again, the big brother"
41:44;41:45;"Badass musician"
41:45;41:47;"Had his Fender Bandmasters"
41:47;41:49;"And Dual Showmans"
41:49;41:51;"And we were just louder than everybody else"
41:51;41:52;"So that's probably why we won"
41:52;41:54;"So my brother Bobby Hornsby"
41:54;41:55;"My older brother"
41:55;41:57;"He was a huge deadhead"
41:57;41:59;"He was in this grateful dead"
41:59;42:00;"Hippie fraternity at University of Virginia"
42:00;42:02;"That used to drop acid"
42:02;42:03;"Paint their faces"
42:03;42:05;"And go play intramural volleyball"
42:05;42:06;"They just were lucky"
42:06;42:09;"If they ever hit the ball once"
42:09;42:10;"They probably lost"
42:10;42:13;"15-0, 15-0, 15-1"
42:13;42:15;"If somebody hit a two-hundred"
42:15;42:16;"It was too long"
42:16;42:18;"So he had a band"
42:18;42:21;"Called Bobby Hightest and the Octane Kids"
42:21;42:23;"And he had me come up"
42:23;42:26;"In my second semester of my freshman year"
42:26;42:28;"At University of Richmond"
42:28;42:30;"I was little Brucie playing Fender Rhodes"
42:30;42:31;"And singing lead"
42:31;42:34;"And singing Jack Straw, etc."
42:34;42:37;"So we would play four grain alcohol parties"
42:37;42:39;"Frat parties with three layers of dancers"
42:39;42:40;"The normal dancers"
42:40;42:41;"The people dancing on tables in the back"
42:41;42:43;"And the people doing the dying cockroach"
42:43;42:44;"On the floor"
42:44;42:47;"It was wild, wild times"
42:47;42:48;"But great fun"
42:48;42:50;"And so I got into the dead"
42:50;42:51;"I liked them a lot"
42:51;42:52;"I loved Europe '72"
42:52;42:54;"That was the first record I had"
42:54;42:55;"And that was a big deal for me"
42:55;42:58;"That and the band's Rock of Ages"
42:58;43:01;"Along with Elton and Leon"
43:01;43:03;"Because if you remember in that era"
43:03;43:06;"Elton's music was very much influenced"
43:06;43:08;"By that Americana"
43:08;43:10;"But by the band, frankly, specifically"
43:10;43:12;"Tumbleweed Connection, that record"
43:12;43:13;"That burned down the Mission"
43:13;43:14;"The great burn down the Mission"
43:14;43:17;"In Amarina, Country Comfort"
43:17;43:19;"So much greatness on that record"
43:19;43:22;"The great Paul Buckmaster string arrangements"
43:22;43:24;"I mean, they just came out and said it"
43:24;43:26;"This is our version of the band"
43:26;43:28;"And then same with Mad Men Across the Water"
43:28;43:31;"With Indian Sunset and on and on"
43:31;43:32;"I'm a big Elton fan as well"
43:32;43:34;"And I've always been interested in that"
43:34;43:36;"Because obviously his public image"
43:36;43:39;"Being an English dude with the big glasses"
43:39;43:41;"And the flashy sequined outfits"
43:41;43:42;"Couldn't be more different"
43:42;43:44;"Than the kind of plain Jane vibe"
43:44;43:46;"Of the Dead or the band"
43:46;43:49;"But he's always said Leon Russell"
43:49;43:51;"Was his huge inspiration as a piano player"
43:51;43:52;"Big fan of the band"
43:52;43:54;"And then Bernie Taupin, his lyricist"
43:54;43:57;"Another just suburban English guy"
43:57;43:59;"So obsessed with the American West"
43:59;44:01;"That's a great point that you mentioned"
44:01;44:04;"Because Elton John, I think today"
44:04;44:06;"It's easy to forget how much his music"
44:06;44:08;"Is rooted in Americana"
44:08;44:09;"And everything's always happening on the farm"
44:09;44:11;"It's such a funny juxtaposition"
44:11;44:12;"It's music"
44:12;44:15;"Right, exactly"
44:15;44:19;"Yeah, all the pines will be falling everywhere"
44:19;44:21;"You know, all that stuff is straight out"
44:21;44:22;"You could hear Richard Manuel"
44:22;44:23;"Singing the same thing"
44:23;44:25;"Or Leigh Vaughan, of course"
44:25;44:26;"So I was into all that"
44:26;44:30;"Now Leon, and Elton had his gospel roots too"
44:30;44:34;"You know, holy Moses I have been received"
44:34;44:36;"But the real gospel titan to me was Leon"
44:36;44:38;"I don't know if you, most people see"
44:38;44:39;"They know Leon"
44:39;44:41;"And I think it's a little bit like Elton too"
44:41;44:43;"Most people know Elton from his hits"
44:43;44:45;"Possibly my favorite record of Elton's"
44:45;44:46;"Is ""Tumblewee Connection"""
44:46;44:47;"Which was the one record back then"
44:47;44:49;"That had no hits on it"
44:49;44:51;"But it was just, to me"
44:51;44:53;"Just had this deep gravitas"
44:53;44:54;"Musically and lyrically"
44:54;44:57;"And so Leon, I know this now"
44:57;44:58;"Because I got to work with him a ton"
44:58;45:00;"And so I really got to know him"
45:00;45:01;"And got to know"
45:01;45:03;"I thought I could do a good Leon Russ limitation"
45:03;45:05;"Until I actually started hanging with him"
45:05;45:06;"Then I realized it was way deeper"
45:06;45:08;"Than my sorry little impression"
45:08;45:10;"But I was able to learn at the feet of the master"
45:10;45:14;"And learn how to do a credible Leon imitation"
45:14;45:17;"And he told me his music came"
45:17;45:20;"His biggest influence was a beautiful"
45:20;45:22;"Black church group called"
45:22;45:23;"The Church of God and Christ"
45:23;45:25;"Kojic for short"
45:25;45:27;"Based in Memphis"
45:27;45:28;"And their music"
45:28;45:30;"For instance, if you listen to Sam Cooke"
45:30;45:32;"And the Soul Stirrers"
45:32;45:34;"Are you into those old gospel records"
45:34;45:35;"From the early 50s?"
45:35;45:39;"I don't know if I know early 50s Sam Cooke"
45:39;45:41;"Well check it out, Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers"
45:41;45:44;"We've been using that music as our pre-show music"
45:44;45:46;"For about 20 years now, maybe longer"
45:46;45:49;"And it's just, once again, a deep well"
45:49;45:53;"And you'll hear in the background"
45:53;45:54;"Because the vocals are so up front"
45:54;45:56;"But sometimes they have instruments playing"
45:56;46:00;"(imitates piano playing)"
46:00;46:04;"That kind of octave"
46:04;46:08;"Piano playing which is so Leon-esque"
46:08;46:11;"And so I guess Leon is Kojic-esque"
46:11;46:13;"And so that's where he got all that"
46:13;46:16;"And again, such a deep well"
46:16;46:18;"Of soul and groove"
46:18;46:21;"And just musicality"
46:21;46:24;"So I grok'd all that"
46:24;46:25;"Or tried to"
46:25;46:28;"So that's also very American"
46:28;46:31;"But not quite as sort of folk"
46:31;46:33;"As Elton and the band were doing"
46:33;46:36;"It was a little more bluesy"
46:36;46:37;"Not that the band wasn't bluesy"
46:37;46:40;"But Leon was really bluesy"
46:40;46:42;"And so I loved all that"
46:42;46:43;"And that got me into Dr. John"
46:43;46:45;"And on and on and on"
46:45;46:47;"So I could bore the dog s*** out of you"
46:47;46:49;"So I'm sorry"
46:49;46:51;"So that's kind of your piano lineage"
46:51;46:53;"Is those guys"
46:53;46:54;"Well, but then"
46:54;46:56;"I used to read Rolling Stone magazine"
46:56;47:00;"And I saw this full page review"
47:00;47:03;"Of two albums by this guy named Keith Jarrett"
47:03;47:06;"And one of them was Expectations"
47:06;47:08;"Which was the only record that he made for Columbia"
47:08;47:10;"Where they put strings on the record"
47:10;47:14;"And tried to make him commercial, quote-unquote"
47:14;47:17;"And his first solo piano record called Facing You"
47:17;47:21;"Which was then on the import-only label ECM"
47:21;47:24;"And so I was intrigued by that"
47:24;47:27;"But you couldn't find those records in Williamsburg, VA"
47:27;47:30;"But I went to a trip looking for schools in Boston"
47:30;47:34;"And I went to the local store, whatever it was called"
47:34;47:35;"And found the import section"
47:35;47:36;"And found this"
47:36;47:36;"You know how"
47:36;47:39;"And I'm sure you'd know, Ezra"
47:39;47:40;"When you're that age"
47:40;47:42;"And you're deeply interested"
47:42;47:44;"And you're looking for something obscure"
47:44;47:47;"It's such a eureka moment when you happen to find it"
47:47;47:48;"You know, a thousand"
47:48;47:50;"Six hundred miles"
47:50;47:51;"Seven hundred miles away from where you are"
47:51;47:52;"So that"
47:52;47:54;"I remember it like it was yesterday"
47:54;47:56;"And took that record home"
47:56;47:56;"And put it on"
47:56;47:59;"And that kind of changed my life"
47:59;48:01;"I really moved away from"
48:01;48:04;"What I had been involved with before"
48:04;48:07;"With the Eltons and Leon and Dr. John"
48:07;48:08;"And all that"
48:08;48:13;"So that made me dive headfirst into that world"
48:13;48:14;"Which is a deep world"
48:14;48:17;"You can dive into that world and never come up"
48:17;48:20;"And it might not be the best thing for you to do that"
48:20;48:24;"But soon enough, I was headlong down the path of"
48:24;48:27;"What the hell is this guy doing?"
48:27;48:29;"How can I figure this out?"
48:29;48:30;"And so that's"
48:30;48:31;"And I'm still trying to"
48:31;48:34;"One thing that I'm kind of curious about is"
48:34;48:35;"When I picture"
48:35;48:37;"The late 70s and the early 80s"
48:37;48:39;"Which would have been the time"
48:39;48:40;"Kind of just before"
48:40;48:41;"Your career really took off"
48:41;48:44;"And I imagine you're figuring a lot of stuff out as an artist"
48:44;48:46;"Creatively and also just career-wise"
48:46;48:50;"So when I picture the late 70s, early 80s"
48:50;48:51;"I always picture that"
48:51;48:54;"That was this time when"
48:54;48:57;"What was considered very cutting-edge music"
48:57;48:59;"There was like the beginnings of hip-hop and punk"
48:59;49:02;"And there was still disco and post-disco"
49:02;49:05;"You know, obviously you could connect all those musics"
49:05;49:07;"Back to Americana and jazz"
49:07;49:09;"And some of the things we've been talking about"
49:09;49:11;"But those things were considered"
49:11;49:14;"These very new cutting-edge types of music"
49:14;49:17;"There were all sorts of new archetypes of"
49:17;49:19;"Stars in every genre coming out"
49:19;49:21;"And one thing's for sure"
49:21;49:23;"Even though they were still selling a lot of tickets"
49:23;49:24;"A band like The Grateful Dead"
49:24;49:25;"A band that also"
49:25;49:28;"Their influences include jazz and Americana"
49:28;49:30;"And all these things combined"
49:30;49:33;"Their cool factor may have been at an all-time low"
49:33;49:35;"Like, of course, they have very dedicated fans"
49:35;49:37;"But it was still, you know, a significant amount of time"
49:37;49:39;"Before the kind of revival"
49:39;49:41;"Where everybody started to be like, ""Oh yeah, The Grateful Dead"
49:41;49:43;"They are maybe the greatest American band"""
49:43;49:44;"So I guess I'm curious"
49:44;49:46;"What did that time period feel like for you"
49:46;49:48;"As somebody who was kind of figuring out"
49:48;49:49;"What you were interested in"
49:49;49:51;"Did you ever have an impulse like"
49:51;49:53;"Maybe I should stop listening to Keith Jarrett"
49:53;49:56;"And just like try to write some new wave songs?"
49:56;49:57;"[Laughs]"
49:57;49:59;"Well, to address something you just said"
49:59;50:01;"Do you really think The Dead gave a rat's ass"
50:01;50:02;"Whether they were cool or not?"
50:02;50:04;"I really don't think they did"
50:04;50:06;"Oh no, I don't think The Dead did"
50:06;50:07;"But I'm curious about"
50:07;50:09;"An up-and-coming Deadhead like you"
50:09;50:10;"In your mid-twenties"
50:10;50:11;"Who's looking at it like"
50:11;50:13;"How am I going to make a living"
50:13;50:14;"And express myself as an artist?"
50:14;50:15;"Yeah, okay, well"
50:15;50:17;"For one thing, I wasn't really a Deadhead"
50:17;50:18;"I was definitely a fan"
50:18;50:19;"But I was more of a"
50:19;50:21;"Keith ""Herbie"" Chick McCoy head"
50:21;50:22;"Right, I see"
50:22;50:23;"For one-namers"
50:23;50:25;"Who constitute the pantheon of"
50:25;50:27;"Modern jazz piano"
50:27;50:27;"Yes"
50:27;50:29;"So, man, I was pretty"
50:29;50:31;"I was kind of a slow learner in this way"
50:31;50:33;"Because I didn't start writing songs"
50:33;50:35;"I was so into playing"
50:35;50:36;"And that was it"
50:36;50:38;"In my college years"
50:38;50:40;"So I came to songwriting"
50:40;50:41;"I considered pretty late"
50:41;50:43;"22, 23"
50:43;50:43;"We got out of college"
50:43;50:45;"We went to get our band"
50:45;50:46;"Said, ""Okay, well, how do you make it?"""
50:46;50:48;"""Oh, I guess somebody's got to write the songs"""
50:48;50:49;"""You know, well, you know the most chords"""
50:49;50:51;"""Well, I guess why don't you do it?"""
50:51;50:53;"So, or I just signed up for the job, I guess"
50:53;50:54;"And, uh"
50:54;50:58;"So, my years of sort of trying to figure out who I was"
50:58;51:00;"They were a little blurry"
51:00;51:01;"We liked Steely Dan"
51:01;51:03;"We liked Asia and Gaucho"
51:03;51:04;"And the records"
51:04;51:06;"Oh, the Pretzellogic records"
51:06;51:08;"""Don't Take Me Alive"" and"
51:08;51:09;"""What Is That Royal Scam?"""
51:09;51:12;"Because that was just sort of a little step"
51:12;51:15;"That had sort of a couple of toes in the jazz world"
51:15;51:16;"Sort of"
51:16;51:17;"Yeah, no, totally"
51:17;51:19;"Harmonic, a chordal level"
51:19;51:21;"So, that's where we were"
51:21;51:23;"We also liked Mike McDonald, who"
51:23;51:26;"I'm sure you know, because you seem to be a bit of a historian"
51:26;51:28;"He was in Steely Dan"
51:28;51:32;"So, his songs with the Dewey Brothers were"
51:32;51:34;"A little more jazzy, a little more R&B"
51:34;51:35;"And we really loved"
51:35;51:37;"I really loved him"
51:37;51:39;"I mentioned that we were discovered"
51:39;51:42;"Well, we were discovered by him, okay"
51:42;51:43;"In a bar in Hampton, Virginia"
51:43;51:45;"And he tried to help us out"
51:45;51:49;"And I guess you could say that we sounded a little bit like"
51:49;51:51;"Pat Metheny meets"
51:51;51:54;"Steely Dan meets rock, okay"
51:54;51:59;"So, as far as what was considered cool, man"
51:59;52:04;"I think we were way outside that Venn diagram, okay"
52:04;52:06;"We did not intersect"
52:06;52:09;"Because that music that I'm just referring to"
52:09;52:12;"Is not part of that pantheon"
52:12;52:12;"You know what I'm saying?"
52:12;52:14;"It just wasn't, then"
52:14;52:18;"It was pop, it was hits top 40"
52:18;52:21;"And so, oh, the people like The Clash"
52:21;52:23;"And Next Pistols"
52:23;52:25;"And the new Wave Axe"
52:25;52:27;"And the cars and all that"
52:27;52:29;"And this is my perception, man"
52:29;52:31;"And frankly, I guess you could ask about me"
52:31;52:33;"What I asked about the dead"
52:33;52:35;"Did I really give much of a rat's"
52:35;52:38;"But I think it wasn't me not giving a s***"
52:38;52:42;"It was mostly me not really having a clue about it, okay"
52:42;52:45;"But I knew that I was not your guy"
52:45;52:49;"To open for the flock of seagulls, you know"
52:49;52:51;"I knew that that's not who I was"
52:51;52:53;"There's another main influence of mine"
52:53;52:55;"And that's Joni Mitchell"
52:55;52:58;"Because, again, she was making ""Ezra"""
52:58;52:59;"Which I totally love"
52:59;53:01;"And Don Juan's ""Reckless Daughter"""
53:01;53:04;"And before that, ""Hissing of Summer Lawns"""
53:04;53:06;"Which really, then ""Cord and Spark"""
53:06;53:08;"Which really started her little dalliance"
53:08;53:10;"With the sort of jazzy chords"
53:10;53:12;"And ""LA Express,"" Tom Scott and all that"
53:12;53:14;"So I was more into that thing"
53:14;53:18;"Like, for instance, I loved Ricky Lee Jones' second record"
53:18;53:19;"I loved the first one"
53:19;53:21;"But ""Pirates"" to me was just transcendent"
53:21;53:22;"And still is"
53:22;53:24;"When we had Justin Vernon on the show"
53:24;53:28;"You said that between you and specifically that album, ""Pirates"""
53:28;53:31;"That's basically his whole inspiration"
53:31;53:32;"Me and ""Pirates""?"
53:32;53:33;"Well, that's..."
53:33;53:34;"Yeah"
53:34;53:35;"Woo!"
53:35;53:36;"Man, Justin, thanks"
53:36;53:37;"That's high freaking praise"
53:37;53:40;"Because I can't hang with ""Pirates"""
53:40;53:41;"That's another level for me"
53:41;53:44;"But thanks, my friend Justin Vernon"
53:44;53:45;"Thanks to him"
53:45;53:47;"So when ""The Way It Is,"" the first album with ""The Range"""
53:47;53:49;"Came out, which obviously we know now"
53:49;53:50;"Went on to be a huge success"
53:50;53:54;"Iconic, you guys won Best New Artist at the Grammys"
53:54;53:57;"Right before that album came out"
53:57;53:58;"What were your expectations?"
53:58;53:59;"Oh, man"
53:59;54:00;"Was there a lot of rumbling?"
54:00;54:02;"Like, ""Oh man, Bruce Horn's being 'The Range'"
54:02;54:03;"This is the next big thing"""
54:03;54:04;"Not at all"
54:04;54:05;"No, no, no"
54:05;54:06;"I'll give you the true story"
54:06;54:09;"The 30th anniversary of that record"
54:09;54:11;"Occurred in '16"
54:11;54:12;"2016"
54:12;54:14;"So I was asked a lot about this"
54:14;54:16;"And I just told the truth about it"
54:16;54:19;"And the truth is not what people expect"
54:19;54:21;"We were mastering the record"
54:21;54:22;"We're getting"
54:22;54:23;"This is all new to me"
54:23;54:24;"All this, you know"
54:24;54:25;"Getting these test pressings and refs"
54:25;54:27;"And my wife comes home from T.C."
54:27;54:29;"Taught school in the Valley"
54:29;54:30;"We live in Van Nuys"
54:30;54:31;"Nice"
54:31;54:32;"The lights are off"
54:32;54:33;"I'm sitting on the couch"
54:33;54:35;"In sort of a dark room"
54:35;54:36;"And it's the evening"
54:36;54:39;"With this morose vibe"
54:39;54:43;"I'm sitting in between our two JBL speakers"
54:43;54:45;"And she says, ""What's going on?"""
54:45;54:47;"I hate my record"
54:47;54:48;"That I"
54:48;54:49;"Okay"
54:49;54:50;"And I did"
54:50;54:51;"And to be honest"
54:51;54:52;"I know this sounds ridiculous"
54:52;54:54;"But I still kind of do"
54:54;54:55;"There was so much about it"
54:55;54:56;"That I thought"
54:56;54:58;"Could have been so much better"
54:58;54:59;"Than what it is"
54:59;55:00;"I'm just being honest"
55:00;55:01;"I know it sounds goofy"
55:01;55:02;"I'm a"
55:02;55:04;"Whatever it sounds like"
55:04;55:05;"That's just the truth of the matter"
55:05;55:07;"What are the things you wanted to change?"
55:07;55:08;"Like a mixing thing?"
55:08;55:09;"To be honest"
55:09;55:11;"I'm not a big fan of that singer"
55:11;55:12;"On those early records"
55:12;55:14;"Just hard to listen to your own voice?"
55:14;55:15;"Yeah, I'm just not"
55:15;55:16;"I just think it's a little wooden"
55:16;55:17;"And a little straight"
55:17;55:19;"And just not good"
55:19;55:20;"Not it"
55:20;55:21;"And so"
55:21;55:23;"So did you feel that way"
55:23;55:24;"When you were listening to the ref"
55:24;55:26;"Of Mansard Roof?"
55:26;55:28;"Or Bryn?"
55:28;55:29;"Yes"
55:29;55:32;"I would say that the earlier"
55:32;55:34;"One of our records"
55:34;55:35;"Like the earlier the record is"
55:35;55:36;"The more likely"
55:36;55:37;"If I happen to hear it somewhere"
55:37;55:38;"I cringe"
55:38;55:39;"But even now"
55:39;55:40;"I don't"
55:40;55:41;"I hate listening back to vocal stuff"
55:41;55:43;"And it really slows down the process"
55:43;55:45;"Because I love living"
55:45;55:46;"In the world"
55:46;55:47;"When all that exists is"
55:47;55:49;"A little instrumental demo"
55:49;55:50;"And I don't have to listen"
55:50;55:51;"To my vocals yet"
55:51;55:52;"And you know"
55:52;55:53;"You gotta rip the band-aid off"
55:53;55:56;"But I can 100% relate to it"
55:56;55:57;"I saw this on Wikipedia"
55:57;55:59;"So I don't know if it's totally legit"
55:59;56:00;"But it said that"
56:00;56:01;"Yeah, I can't believe that one"
56:01;56:02;"Yeah, I know this"
56:02;56:03;"So you gotta tell us"
56:03;56:04;"It says that the album"
56:04;56:05;"Was originally targeted"
56:05;56:07;"At the new age music market"
56:07;56:09;"And it had slightly different versions"
56:09;56:10;"Of songs"
56:10;56:11;"Is that true?"
56:11;56:13;"That's completely untrue"
56:13;56:14;"Untrue"
56:14;56:16;"Why Wikipedia page says that?"
56:16;56:17;"The album Wikipedia page"
56:17;56:18;"It says there were slightly different versions"
56:18;56:19;"Of Down the Road Tonight"
56:19;56:21;"And The River Runs Low"
56:21;56:22;"And it says"
56:22;56:23;"It implies that they were new age-ier"
56:23;56:25;"No, that's just somebody guessing"
56:25;56:26;"Here's the deal with that"
56:26;56:27;"Here's the"
56:27;56:29;"Those three songs were produced"
56:29;56:30;"By Huey Lewis"
56:30;56:31;"Those are two of the three"
56:31;56:33;"Before I had learned to say no"
56:33;56:34;"You know"
56:34;56:35;"Learned to say"
56:35;56:36;"Put my foot down"
56:36;56:37;"And be assertive"
56:37;56:38;"When I thought something was not right"
56:38;56:39;"And he was my good friend"
56:39;56:40;"He's still my good friend"
56:40;56:42;"But I didn't like the versions"
56:42;56:44;"And so I went back in"
56:44;56:45;"Stripped everything off"
56:45;56:46;"River Runs Low"
56:46;56:47;"And turned it into a"
56:47;56:48;"Keyboard vocal"
56:48;56:49;"So the second pressing"
56:49;56:50;"And you know"
56:50;56:51;"Luckily for me"
56:51;56:52;"There were several pressings"
56:52;56:53;"Of that record"
56:53;56:54;"And so only the first"
56:54;56:55;"Whatever hundred"
56:55;56:56;"Had the one that I wasn't too fond of"
56:56;56:58;"And same with Down the Road"
56:58;56:59;"And so yeah"
56:59;57:00;"That's so funny"
57:00;57:01;"That someone's just guessing that"
57:01;57:04;"And that they couldn't be more wrong"
57:04;57:05;"That's the reason"
57:05;57:07;"I wonder with the new age thing"
57:07;57:08;"So I see that"
57:08;57:09;"Maybe with different pressings"
57:09;57:11;"There were different album covers"
57:11;57:12;"The original one"
57:12;57:14;"That doesn't have you guys on it"
57:14;57:15;"I guess I can see that"
57:15;57:16;"That has that kind of"
57:16;57:18;"Vibey abstract painting"
57:18;57:19;"I'm not sure what it is"
57:19;57:22;"I guess that maybe reads a little new agey"
57:22;57:23;"Maybe that's what they meant"
57:23;57:24;"Well no here's how that happened"
57:24;57:25;"That's so funny revisiting this"
57:25;57:27;"I haven't thought about this sort of stuff for years"
57:27;57:28;"But yeah okay"
57:28;57:30;"So it was the Blurry Accordion Man"
57:30;57:32;"That was the first cover"
57:32;57:34;"The record was released in America first"
57:34;57:36;"And then about three or four months later"
57:36;57:37;"It's being released in Europe"
57:37;57:38;"And in England"
57:38;57:41;"And the Europeans came to the American label"
57:41;57:43;"And said we think this record's okay"
57:43;57:46;"But the cover just does not speak to us at all"
57:46;57:48;"It feels a little country"
57:48;57:49;"So can you come up with another cover"
57:49;57:50;"So we came up with that cover"
57:50;57:54;"Which was really the inside sleeve picture of the band"
57:54;57:55;"As the cover"
57:55;57:56;"With the picture of the truck"
57:56;57:59;"Rolling across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge tunnel"
57:59;58:01;"That became the background of the cover"
58:01;58:04;"So that's the reason for that"
58:04;58:06;"But speaking of new age now"
58:06;58:07;"It's funny to note"
58:07;58:10;"The demo tape that got me signed"
58:10;58:12;"I got two offers"
58:12;58:14;"One from RCA and one from Epic"
58:14;58:15;"And that was it"
58:15;58:16;"I picked RCA and that was it"
58:16;58:18;"But before that"
58:18;58:20;"I had made this tape very quietly"
58:20;58:21;"Just by myself"
58:21;58:24;"Just me and a Linn drum machine"
58:24;58:27;"And playing synth bass on an Oberheim OBX"
58:27;58:29;"And piano and vocal"
58:29;58:32;"And I knew this woman who worked for Wyndham Hill"
58:32;58:34;"You know the quintessential"
58:34;58:35;"The archetypal new age label"
58:35;58:37;"Or George Winston's label"
58:37;58:39;"And I thought maybe they might be interested in it"
58:39;58:41;"Because I thought no major label"
58:41;58:43;"Would have any interest in this music"
58:43;58:45;"So I sent this to her"
58:45;58:46;"I sent two songs to her"
58:46;58:48;"The way it is in Mandolin Rain"
58:48;58:49;"And she said"
58:49;58:51;"""Well, Will Ackerman, the head of the label"
58:51;58:52;"He loves this"
58:52;58:53;"Can we hear a couple more?"""
58:53;58:54;"I said"
58:54;58:55;"""Well, I'm doing a session this week"""
58:55;58:56;"So she came down"
58:56;58:57;"Took a tape from there"
58:57;58:58;"Gave it to Will"
58:58;59:00;"And Will Ackerman called me on a Sunday night"
59:00;59:01;"I'll never forget it"
59:01;59:03;"Because I'd been trying to get something going"
59:03;59:04;"For many years"
59:04;59:05;"And all of a sudden"
59:05;59:06;"This was so easy"
59:06;59:07;"He called and said"
59:07;59:08;"""Okay, we want you"""
59:08;59:09;"So we went from there"
59:09;59:11;"And a couple of labels heard about it"
59:11;59:12;"And got in the picture"
59:12;59:14;"And I didn't go to Windham Hill"
59:14;59:16;"But I would have been just satisfied"
59:16;59:18;"I don't think that music"
59:18;59:20;"Sounded like new age music"
59:20;59:22;"But they were starting a vocal label"
59:22;59:25;"And so this was going to be on the Windham Hill"
59:25;59:26;"I guess pop label"
59:26;59:28;"But no, there was never"
59:28;59:30;"That thing that you read"
59:30;59:33;"Yeah, that's just a complete load"
59:33;59:35;"We've got to get that changed"
59:35;59:36;"For what it's worth"
59:36;59:37;"There's no footnote"
59:37;59:39;"On that part of the Wikipedia page"
59:39;59:42;"Oh, so it should be very easy to get it taken off"
59:42;59:45;"I'll leave that to Jake Longstrap"
59:45;59:46;"Yeah"
59:46;59:50;"Jake said his Wikipedia page vandalized himself"
59:50;59:52;"So he's very familiar with the feeling"
59:52;59:54;"Of something untrue being up there"
59:54;59:55;"Oh yeah"
59:55;59:58;"Song came and went"
59:58;01:00:01;"Like the times that we spent"
01:00:01;01:00:05;"Hiding out from the rain"
01:00:05;01:00:09;"Under the carnival tan"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"Laughed and she'd smile"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"It would last for a while"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"You don't know what you got"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"'Til you lose it all again"
01:00:22;01:00:28;"Listen to the music on the radio"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"Oh, listen to my heartbreak"
01:00:31;01:00:35;"Every time she runs away"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"Oh, listen to the banjo when"
01:00:38;01:00:42;"My sad song drifted home"
01:00:42;01:00:45;"Listen to the tears roll"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"On my face as she turns to gold"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"When did you start playing with The Grateful Dead?"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"And how did that happen, given that"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"You must have been incredibly busy"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Just with your own stuff?"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"Well, right, I was pretty bad at being a pop star"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"In those early days"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"I was a little laughable"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"'Cause for one thing, I was 31 years old"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"A little bit like Justin, really"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Or like Mark Knopper"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"People who get a later start"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"So at that time"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"I'm being sent around to these"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"You know, say the Q104 star party in Cleveland"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"You know, WMMS, whatever it is"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"And I'm sitting there"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"At a table signing autographs"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"For little children"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"On one side of me is Tiffany"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"And the other side is Debbie"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"It's like, man, what is wrong with this picture?"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"It's me, I'm what's wrong with the picture, wasn't it?"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"So it was a little clownish to me"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"I just, that meant"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"What have I gotten into?"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"This is not what I want"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"This is not what I was aiming for here, you know?"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"I'm like Ornette Coleman"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"You know, what's happened here?"
01:01:45;01:01:49;"So the first record went pretty far pretty fast"
01:01:49;01:01:52;"And so we had to learn how to become headliners"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"On nine songs that comprised our first record"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"So we're fleshing it out"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"We played two covers"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"One of them was the band's version"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Of ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"""
01:02:02;01:02:04;"""Oh, the streets of Rome"""
01:02:04;01:02:07;"You know, the ""Levant are filled with rubble"""
01:02:07;01:02:09;"You know, it's a great version"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"With Garth's great accordion"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"And I would play accordion on it"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"And then we would take my song"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"The last song on that latest record"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"Called ""The Red Plains"""
01:02:18;01:02:19;"We would take that into"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Sort of a spacey segue jam"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Into ""I Know You, Rider"""
01:02:24;01:02:25;"So that's what we were doing"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"We were playing those 11 songs every night"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"And so then all of a sudden"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"We got a call out of the blue"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"In February of '87"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"From the Grateful Dead"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Asking if we would open shows"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"""Rycooter"" ""Us and the Dead"""
01:02:39;01:02:43;"Two days at Laguna Seca Racetrack in Monterey"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"So of course, you know"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I'd been the Bender Rhodes player"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"In the Octane Kids"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Hell yeah, I'm saying yes to that"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"So we'd had a great group of people"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"That we'd opened for that year"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"The first guy we opened for"
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Was Steve Winwood"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"And then Huey Lewis"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"Then John Fogarty"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Then the Eurythmics"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"And then, yeah, it was fantastic"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"We played the Reichstag"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"With the Eurythmics"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"And afterwards I got on the phone"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"From different hotel rooms"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"With Annie Lennox"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"And we just talked for an hour"
01:03:10;01:03:13;"You know, it's a beautiful memory"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"That was just incredible"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"So right, we did two days"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"With the Dead then"
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I remember very well"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"Where I was playing"
01:03:19;01:03:22;"I saw Phil Lesch on the side of the stage"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"So I was doing a piano intro"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"To some song"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"And I saw Phil there"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"And I knew he liked bitonality"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"So I decided to go into this thing"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"A bitonal version of Scott Joplin's"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"The Entertainer, you know"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"(Hums)"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"But one hand in C and one hand in C sharp"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"So it's just hateful to most ears"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"It just lifted"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"And it was just another"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Just great memory to see Phil"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"All of a sudden, rear back"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"And just short all the way"
01:03:51;01:03:54;"And I'm just inflicting this"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Bitonal pain on the poor"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Suspecting deadheads, you know"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"So then the next year, '88"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"They asked us to open"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"A couple more shows"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"We played Buck I Like"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"And this time they asked me"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"To sit in with them"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"I played Sugary"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"And Stuck Inside a Mobile"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"On accordion with them"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"And Jerry gets on the mic"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"And says, ""We don't let just anybody"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Sit on an accordion with us"""
01:04:17;01:04:18;"You know, just those memories"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"That you will just not forget"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"You know, it was just"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Amazingly beautiful"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"And then we played"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"Rainforest Benefit"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"At Madison Square Garden"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"And Susanne Vega"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"And Holland Oates"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"And then the next year"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"They asked us to open"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"Some more '89"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"Three more shows"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"RFK"
01:04:35;01:04:38;"The late great JFK"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"And Philly"
01:04:39;01:04:40;"And uh"
01:04:40;01:04:41;"So I would sit in with them"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"All the time at that point"
01:04:42;01:04:43;"And I got so"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"I would sit"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"I'd just come in"
01:04:45;01:04:46;"When they were geographically close to me"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"And sit in with them"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Say, at the Forum in L.A."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"And Garcia then played"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"On our third record"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"It just was this"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"Growing relationship"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Especially between Jerry and me"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"That just kept on"
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Going on and going on"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"Jerry played on our third record"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"And then he came down"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"And did this taped concert"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"And then Brent died"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"And I was walking down the street"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Early in the morning in Seattle"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"I'd just gotten a call"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"Telling me this"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"And not an hour later"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"At six in the morning"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"I'm walking down the street"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"And somebody comes up to me"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"And says, ""Hey Bruce"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Are you gonna join the Dead?"""
01:05:19;01:05:21;"I mean it was already out"
01:05:21;01:05:22;"It was unbelievable"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"The rapid"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"The Deadhead on the street"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"Just saw you and was like"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Yes!"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"And sure enough"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"A few nights later"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Garcia and Phil"
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Came out to"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"Concord Pavilion"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Where we were playing"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"And asked me to join the band"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"And uh"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"So I said, ""Look"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"If you'd have found me"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Four years ago"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Five years ago"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"I would have"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Absolutely said yes"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"You know I love you guys"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And I'll help you"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"Through any tough time you"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"Have here"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"I got this other thing"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Going fairly solidly now"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"But I will help you"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"And so then"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"They took me up on that"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"And I played with them"
01:05:54;01:05:55;"For the next twenty months"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"And then so after that"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"You would just kind of"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Come in and out"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"For when you were close"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"And that's exactly right"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"At the end though"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"When he was really"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"He was really struggling"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"The year '95"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"They actually"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Someone who wouldn't know"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Sort of the inside"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Dope about it"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Would just all of a sudden"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"See me show up in Charlotte"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"And then"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"See me show up in"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"In uh"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"At RFK for the last two nights"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"In June"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"And that was because"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"They would call me"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"When I was geographically close"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"And they'd either"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"They'd fly me up or down"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"And rent a piano"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"To ask me to play"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"Because they thought"
01:06:30;01:06:31;"It would pick Jerry up"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"So that was really sad"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"But I"
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Look I remember"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"Those gigs fondly"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"And I had a great time"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Doing those last three"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"1995 shows"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Right near the end"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"And yeah"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"I talked to Garcia"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"Four days before he died"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Wow"
01:06:45;01:06:46;"That'd be"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"I called him"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"To check on him"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"After the tour was over"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"And Steve Parrish"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Answered"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"You know who Steve is?"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Oh yeah"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Big Steve"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Part of the crew"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"His guy"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"His manager"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"His minder"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Long time"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Right hand man"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"To Garcia"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"And he answers the phone"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"At Jerry's house"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"And he says"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Well hey man"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"We're getting ready"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"To take Jerry"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"As you probably know"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"That we're getting ready"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"To take Jerry"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"To Betty Ford"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"And here he is"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"So he got on the phone"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"And said"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"He's been waiting for"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"A month or five weeks"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"And hoping for the best"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"And he seemed in good spirits"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"And so"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Okay we had a nice"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"Talk about it"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"And then"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"About two weeks later"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"I decided to just call"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"And check in"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"And see if anyone answered"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Get a little progress report"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"On him"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"And he answered"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"Saying"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I think I'm good"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Two weeks was enough"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"And he proceeded to tell me"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"All about"
01:07:34;01:07:35;"The people he'd met"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"The young kid"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"Who was a big Django"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"Reinhardt fanatic"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"And so how he bought"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"The tickets"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"And all that"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"And he said"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"I'm gonna call"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"And see if anyone"
