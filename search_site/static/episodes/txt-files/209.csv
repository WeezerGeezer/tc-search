00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On today's episode we're joined by Dave Maklovich"
00:08;00:18;"to talk gift-giving. Plus we listen to new music from Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign."
00:18;00:27;"All that plus the greatest foreigner song of all time. This is Time Crisis with Ezra"
00:27;00:30;"Koenig."
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis back again. Boy we got so much on the docket. Breaking news,"
01:20;01:25;"Seinfeld and I just found out that Jake and Nick have another crew called the"
01:25;01:32;"Lunch Boys. Yeah what the f*ck. Side crew. Sound the alarm. I mean, well first of all, I think, have we"
01:32;01:41;"discussed this on the program? Every grown man needs at least two crews. Now"
01:41;01:46;"some people might define that as like a text thread. Ideally you have three and I"
01:46;01:50;"know this probably sounds like a lot but guys there's a loneliness epidemic out"
01:50;01:57;"there. So to keep your head above water you really you need a lot of you need a"
01:57;02:01;"lot of text threads and a lot of crews because you never know which one might"
02:01;02:07;"go dormant for a year. We had another text, do you remember we had one Ezra, with a"
02:07;02:12;"bunch of dudes I never met that you put on. We remember we were the, are the"
02:12;02:17;"steppers, the hot steppers. Oh yeah that didn't last very long. But when it lasted"
02:17;02:20;"it was funny that was just about how many steps all of us had taken that day."
02:20;02:24;"Right, that had a moment. But look everybody needs multiple crews. It was"
02:24;02:28;"just surprising for me and Seinfeld to hear that you guys had a crew called"
02:28;02:33;"Lunch Boys. This is a shocker. I do have a, I do have a group with just Jake where"
02:33;02:37;"sometimes we'll occasionally text each other about like TV shows and stuff."
02:37;02:43;"It's true. Does that count? Wait it's, who's in the group? Just you and Jake? It's just me and Jake."
02:43;02:48;"Sometimes, no that, of course it doesn't count. But it's a crew of two. That's two men"
02:48;02:54;"texting each other. We went pretty deep on the curse, me and Seinfeld over text."
02:54;03:01;"Right well that sucks because that feels like that could have gone into the TC."
03:01;03:06;"Actually me and Nick are on a different text thread that has a lot of curse stuff. Yeah"
03:06;03:11;"we're on one with uh... With Blackbird Spy Plane. But look it's important to have"
03:11;03:16;"different splinter cells. Okay but anyway and also it's one thing to say oh yeah"
03:16;03:20;"I have a text thread with the handful of people that sometimes it is about like"
03:20;03:25;"the most random sh*t ever. I mean technically it's very dormant but Jake, Jake and I"
03:25;03:32;"have a crew, have a Pearl Jam crew with Adam from We're On Drugs who we've both"
03:32;03:40;"met once and and then my dear friend and colleague Brian who we work with very"
03:40;03:46;"closely. That's a great thread I think we should uh resurrect that Pearl Jam thread."
03:46;03:49;"Well there's got to be some good Pearl Jam news. Seinfeld can you just do a"
03:49;03:53;"quick search has there been any good Pearl Jam news lately? My brother texted"
03:53;03:58;"me that there's a new Pearl Jam single that sounds like mid-period Fugazi"
03:58;04:02;"specifically in on the killtaker. Okay. Maybe we should throw that on because I"
04:02;04:06;"have not heard this new PJ. Let's listen to it so we both have something to talk"
04:06;04:09;"about on the text thread."
04:50;04:57;"I don't know if I have but it makes it feel way more official. I like that part."
04:57;05:00;"The little Zeppelin descending riff."
05:11;05:15;"Thread's dead for like two years. Yeah. Adam what do you think of the new Pearl Jam"
05:15;05:25;"single? I'm feeling it I'm kind of hearing a Fugazi influence. You with me dog?"
05:25;05:33;"All right I've heard enough. Yeah I'm not I'm not vibing with this Pearl Jam right now."
05:33;05:44;"I mean it's not bad. It's a terrible drum sound. At least through like my ear buds on the laptop it's rough stuff."
05:44;05:49;"Okay but so the Lunch Boys is a group of guys who gets lunch together?"
05:49;05:56;"Well yeah I think I was saying right before we started that I think we've convened twice in about three years."
05:56;06:04;"It's me, Nick, friend of the show Michael Schmeling and then an artist named Freddie Kunath."
06:04;06:10;"Right and Schmeling is a photographer. He actually took a lot of the new Vampire Weekend press pictures."
06:10;06:15;"Oh wow. That's right. I did not know that. If you caught any of those."
06:15;06:19;"All right so I feel like this is this is kind of like the arts crew. A little bit."
06:19;06:29;"Although Nick is this chameleonic figure just weaving his way through the worlds of music, television and fine art."
06:29;06:36;"I guess I'm just sort of a connector. Nick's got a lot of items to fire."
06:36;06:43;"I'm just trying to tie the binds. But you know. Nick's taking five percent. Nick's my manager."
06:43;06:51;"But I do feel that it wouldn't be unusual to throw anyone in this crew into the Lunch Boys."
06:51;06:59;"It did start as a way that I have you know two close friends who are painters. Jake and Freddie."
06:59;07:04;"And they were actually there was a moment where they were starting to work with the same gallery."
07:04;07:08;"And I was like oh you guys and Freddie was there. We should or vice versa should meet each other."
07:08;07:12;"So I was like oh let's all go to lunch. And then the text thread sort of took off."
07:12;07:15;"I think from there and planning this lunch. That's the way to do it."
07:15;07:20;"And then Jake and Schmeling are both diehard Steve Forbert fans. Yes."
07:20;07:27;"So that is true. Forbert crew. I've been wearing I've been rocking that Steve Forbert shirt a lot recently."
07:27;07:29;"Have we talked about it on the show. I don't know if we talked about it."
07:29;07:34;"Well I feel like we talked about it in an episode that will air later after this episode."
07:34;07:42;"Oh that's going to be confusing for people. I really messed up. I bought Christmas gifts for the whole crew."
07:42;07:48;"I sent our producer Matt the Guy Fieri Christmas garbage can. It's a good one."
07:48;07:56;"And then for the on air talent I got some T-shirts that I thought felt right for for each guy."
07:56;08:01;"So Jake's is probably the best which was a vintage Steve Forbert T-shirt."
08:01;08:05;"And it's got all the vibe of like what exactly what you would hope of it."
08:05;08:10;"Steve Forbert T-shirt looks like. And Jake tried it on and it was a perfect fit."
08:10;08:17;"And it's yeah it's a legit beautiful design. Plain white tee with just a black and white photographic full body image."
08:17;08:23;"You former student and then just in red all caps lettering Steve Forbert."
08:23;08:30;"Wait actually it's so tight. But I want Nick and Seinfeld I want to show you the shirts that I got you guys because it's been sitting here."
08:30;08:35;"Like Seinfeld you came over for my Super Bowl party and remember when you said I said remind me I got something for you."
08:35;08:39;"But then of course you know we were so caught up in the game."
08:39;08:46;"I remembered it on my way out too. It was a great game. Yeah I remembered it on the way out and then I was like s***."
08:46;08:54;"Yeah. I just want to show you guys now so that because we're like two months out from when I should have given it to you."
08:54;08:59;"I feel like as long as you get to shirts by like July 4th weekend then we're good."
08:59;09:04;"I think our listeners might appreciate this because I got you some little stocking stuffers too."
09:04;09:11;"OK but I saw this shirt. It's a beautiful blue shirt but I don't know who I thought this would be for."
09:11;09:18;"I think I kind of pictured this one was for Nick initially but when it came I'm like this is going to fit Seinfeld better."
09:18;09:28;"And it's a very cozy feels like an early 80s shirt. A really nice been you can tell it's been washed a thousand times."
09:28;09:35;"Light blue shirt. Let's see. Can you guys read it if I hold it up. Hold it up. Oh Seinfeld."
09:35;09:43;"So much text. All right. First I was a good boy. Then I became a nice kid. After that I was a great guy."
09:43;09:53;"Later I grew to be a fine man. Now I'm just an old fart. So that one's for Seinfeld."
09:53;10:00;"And that's got Seinfeld coffee shop challenge. Yeah. You're going to be wearing that to work and everything."
10:00;10:06;"And then I think maybe initially I thought that one would be for Nick but it was like maybe I got the sizing wrong."
10:06;10:11;"And then the one that this one is so random. This is a pretty cool vintage shirt."
10:11;10:21;"But basically it's a interesting drawing of a cyclist. And it's OK. That's sick. Does it say anything."
10:21;10:28;"Yeah it says Montreal Canada on the bottom. I think. Oh well obviously obviously that was for Seinfeld."
10:28;10:32;"Yeah. But you know what. It was meant to be because this one I think will fit you better."
10:32;10:38;"And the old fart one will fit Seinfeld better. So then. And to be honest that may have been too on the nose."
10:38;10:45;"You know and also it's funny looking back. I clearly when you got to buy gifts for a crew."
10:45;10:54;"I don't know if you run into this problem with the lunch boys but when you have to buy gifts for a crew it's really hard to nail each person like 100 percent."
10:54;11:01;"And I felt like when I found this vintage C4 bird shirt for Jake I was just like this feels so right."
11:01;11:05;"It's perfect for Jake. And I've always had a hard time. I've had a hard time with gift giving."
11:05;11:11;"People could turn it around and say I'm a Scrooge. There's times I probably didn't buy a gift when I should have."
11:11;11:20;"In my mind it's because I care a little too much. And I do I do really freeze up when I'm about to buy somebody a mid gift."
11:20;11:27;"And so anyway I nailed it so hard with Jake and then I found the old fart shirt and I was like oh maybe Nick will find that funny."
11:27;11:38;"And I was left with Seinfeld. Just like that's how insane I was just like late night on eBay like vintage Montreal shirt."
11:38;11:41;"So it's all for the best that Nick will get the Montreal shirt."
11:41;11:44;"I love it. It's very thoughtful of you Ezra. It means a lot. Yeah. Thank you."
11:44;11:51;"My pleasure. I think I I mean I guess like anybody I do love giving giving a gift if it feels right."
11:51;11:59;"If there's like something that feels a little fun about it or somehow connected to some the relationship."
11:59;12:06;"But you know like when you're under the gun to get a gift even if it's somebody like a dear friend somebody you really care about."
12:06;12:12;"It could be kind of a painful feeling. You're just like standing there and you're just like am I really about to buy this dude a candle."
12:12;12:22;"Like oh God. You know what I mean. Like I can't show up empty handed and yet part of my brain is screaming better to give nothing than to buy this dumb book."
12:22;12:26;"That's just going to clutter up their house. You know you want to know."
12:26;12:30;"Meet me in the middle of the day. Let me hear you say everything's OK."
12:30;12:36;"Bring me southern kisses from your room."
12:36;12:41;"Meet me in the middle of the night. Let me hear you say everything's all right."
12:41;12:45;"Let me smell the moon in your perfume."
12:45;12:52;"Oh God's. Lost in talk."
12:52;12:55;"Waste my time and it's all been said before."
12:55;13:01;"While further down behind the masquerade the tears of the."
13:01;13:05;"I don't ask for all that much. I just want someone."
13:05;13:14;"I think one of the first times we met I gave you something."
13:14;13:21;"I don't know if you remember this. I'm guessing it was Seinfeld related but it was a DVD copy of the B movie."
13:21;13:25;"Yeah. And I was sort of in but 20."
13:25;13:36;"14 15. And I remember you seemed a little nonplussed. You see the little like. Well I'm not going to I'm not going to watch this but I think you appreciated it."
13:36;13:43;"Yeah I think probably I was no longer buying DVDs at that moment in my life. I think the medium. Yeah."
13:43;13:51;"Was a little that that would actually be a cool. But I do like it especially now. It'd be cool to just start getting people DVDs all the time."
13:51;14:00;"Oh yeah. They're back. They're back. Breaking Bad season three DVD box set. Very cool."
14:00;14:07;"Just a used season three Breaking Bad box set would be pretty sick."
14:07;14:12;"It's going to take up a fair amount of space on the shelf and look terrible."
14:12;14:17;"Yeah. Well remember they used to do like video box sets. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."
14:17;14:25;"Those I have that I have that for Twin Peaks. The whole Twin Peaks box set. You know it's like eight or something six of them."
14:25;14:31;"I mean that's actually cool. Well D.V. I mean Seinfeld wasn't lying. I mean DVDs are coming back."
14:31;14:36;"Look how hard vinyl came back. DVDs are coming. I mean yeah vinyl is huge. Yeah."
14:36;14:47;"Oh by the way I should say go to www.vampireweekend.com and you can preorder The Only God Was Above Us vinyl which is very beautiful."
14:47;14:55;"With photos by Lunch Boy Michael Schmeling. Oh yeah. Well yeah. There's actually yeah on the inside there's some photos from Schmeling."
14:55;15:03;"You can get it in black or clear vinyl. And you know what actually is crazy? We did this like CD box set that I actually think looks sick."
15:03;15:12;"What do you mean box set? It's like you can it comes with a T-shirt but it's a I think it's a cardboard box that has like the album cover printed on it."
15:12;15:20;"And inside you get like a T-shirt with one of the Steven Seagal images plus the CD. And actually like I still I still love CDs."
15:20;15:27;"I have a CD player in the house and I was actually really you know obviously we put so much work into primarily thinking about the LP."
15:27;15:33;"But then it still is fun kind of like thinking about the CD and what image goes on the CD."
15:33;15:44;"And like I still get really hyped when I see like the they call it the OB strip which is the thing they wrap the cardboard piece that they wrap around the side in Japan."
15:44;15:51;"All right. Like when I get when I get like a picture of it and it has information about the band and of course text in Japanese."
15:51;15:57;"I still get hyped about the Japanese CD version. So don't count out CDs either."
15:57;16:05;"Where'd you guys press the vinyl? You know I mean offhand. It's all over the world. That's about really great."
16:05;16:14;"Yeah it's not just one plant in like Pittsburgh pumping out like tens of thousands of Vampire Weekend I think records."
16:14;16:25;"That's an interesting question. I know that Columbia uses plants all over the world because I was talking to the dude who's the head of physical production."
16:25;16:37;"And he was telling me that and this is kind of like a famous story that his first week on the job or at least his first week of being in charge of production"
16:37;16:46;"was the week that some insane number of Beyonce records were printed with Side B being a death metal album."
16:46;16:47;"Amazing."
16:47;16:50;"This is like in the news. I don't think I'm like blowing up any spots."
16:50;16:54;"I missed the story. What are those going for on eBay?"
16:54;17:01;"Yes it's funny like I'm sure at the time everybody was like what a nightmare and then in retrospect it's like oh I wish I had that."
17:01;17:07;"Do you know how many were pressed or would you rather not say? I'm just curious."
17:07;17:13;"I remember I mean the way the guy told the story he was like it was a big number it was crazy and I remember I think those were pressed in Europe."
17:13;17:15;"That's my vague memory of the story."
17:15;17:22;"Yeah German record pressing plant lemonade filled with punk songs after factory error."
17:22;17:36;"Thanks to a human error at Celebrate Records vinyl pressing plant in Germany uphill battle an album by Ontario band Zex was pressed onto the lemon yellow vinyl instead of lemonade tracks."
17:36;17:40;"It doesn't say how many in the Guardian here were made."
17:40;17:48;"Quote Zex guitarist saying a lot of them had said oh I like the surprise I got on the other side it's good music even though it's not what they paid for."
17:48;17:53;"Do you know how many were pressed of The Vampire?"
17:53;17:56;"Don't know."
17:56;17:57;"No idea."
17:57;18:01;"Fascinating like anticipated album by a big band."
18:01;18:07;"It's like are you pressing 20,000 100,000 I have no idea."
18:07;18:15;"Yeah and you don't want to like run out either and I know there's and then we think there's special ones with different we did like a clear vinyl."
18:15;18:20;"And there's going to be this indie store exclusive with a different cover which looks sick."
18:20;18:23;"I'm a black vinyl guy personally."
18:23;18:24;"Just basic black."
18:24;18:25;"Classic."

19:43;19:45;"We've done that with a Third Man."
19:45;19:48;"So those are printed in Preston, Tennessee."
19:48;19:49;"- Tight."
19:49;19:52;"Is Third Man, is that the Jack White thing?"
19:52;19:54;"- Yeah. - Yeah, he owns it."
19:54;19:57;"- Did you interface directly with Jack about this project?"
19:57;19:58;"- No."
19:58;20:02;"I have met Jack briefly over the years."
20:02;20:03;"Always seemed like a nice guy."
20:03;20:06;"- We went to a show of his, you and I,"
20:06;20:09;"God, five, six years ago."
20:09;20:11;"- Wait, that was like in downtown LA?"
20:11;20:12;"- Yeah, remember?"
20:12;20:13;"- Yeah."
20:13;20:15;"- Yeah, it was at some little theater downtown."
20:15;20:18;"I remember we met Jude Law backstage."
20:18;20:19;"- Oh yeah."
20:19;20:23;"- And he was like towering over me."
20:23;20:24;"- Really, how tall is he?"
20:24;20:25;"- I don't know, I just remember,"
20:25;20:26;"at least in my memory, you know,"
20:26;20:28;"memory is fallible, but in my memory,"
20:28;20:30;"I'm like, I remember going home like,"
20:30;20:33;"oh yeah, you know, I met Jude Law tonight"
20:33;20:36;"at this backstage with Ezra at this Jack White show"
20:36;20:38;"and he was, in my head, he's a giant."
20:38;20:40;"Wait, how tall is he?"
20:40;20:42;"- He's 6'7""."
20:42;20:43;"- No, he's not. - No, because--"
20:43;20:43;"- Really?"
20:43;20:45;"- No, I know Jude a bit."
20:45;20:46;"- He's 5'10""."
20:46;20:47;"- What?"
20:47;20:49;"- See, that's--"
20:49;20:50;"(laughing)"
20:50;20:52;"- That's what it is. - Jude is not a guy."
20:52;20:54;"- He has such tall guy energy, so much confidence."
20:54;20:55;"- He's not short."
20:55;20:57;"- He's 5'10""."
20:57;20:58;"- I'm 5'9""."
20:58;20:59;"- I think you're taller than him."
20:59;21:01;"- No, I don't think so."
21:01;21:04;"That's, folks, that's why they call him movie stars,"
21:04;21:05;"'cause I went home and I was like,"
21:05;21:07;"that guy was just a Greek god."
21:07;21:09;"- It's so funny, I--"
21:09;21:11;"- Also, you were reacting to the fact"
21:11;21:13;"that he's a handsome, charismatic man."
21:13;21:15;"- I think he was wearing like a nice suit."
21:15;21:17;"Again, this is my like--"
21:17;21:18;"- He's your height."
21:18;21:23;"- I was probably wearing like a cruddy, like polar fleece."
21:24;21:25;"- Wait, who is this?"
21:25;21:26;"Who are we talking about?"
21:26;21:27;"- Jude Law. - Jude Law."
21:27;21:29;"- Ah, Jude Law. - This is so random."
21:29;21:30;"- Great actor."
21:30;21:31;"- Great actor. - Phenomenal."
21:31;21:32;"- I'm just saying."
21:32;21:33;"- Giant."
21:33;21:34;"- Young pope."
21:34;21:35;"- Jack White came up and I was like,"
21:35;21:38;"oh yeah, I remember going to a Jack White show"
21:38;21:39;"with Ezra and Jude Law."
21:39;21:41;"- Wait, but you know, Jack White's pretty tall."
21:41;21:42;"- Is he?"
21:42;21:45;"- I don't think we talked to him that night."
21:45;21:46;"- Jack White is 6'2""."
21:46;21:47;"- Yep."
21:47;21:49;"- Okay, that's a good height."
21:49;21:51;"- Okay, well there's also an obvious thing"
21:51;21:55;"that kinda transcends energy, which is posture."
21:55;21:57;"Like if somebody gets their posture right,"
21:57;22:00;"they literally are towering above you more."
22:00;22:01;"You know what's funny though?"
22:01;22:04;"There's like a famous thing in Vampire Weekend"
22:04;22:08;"because in the current three official member"
22:08;22:11;"of Vampire Weekend, if you can believe it,"
22:11;22:14;"I'm the shortest member at six feet."
22:14;22:14;"- I believe it."
22:14;22:18;"- So people always come and say like, wow, tall band."
22:18;22:19;"- Truly."
22:19;22:22;"- And so CT and Bayo are, I don't know,"
22:22;22:25;"they're like within, they're close."
22:25;22:26;"Don't quote me on the numbers,"
22:26;22:30;"but maybe somebody's 6'2 1/4 and somebody's 6'3"","
22:30;22:33;"like, or somebody's 6'2 1/2."
22:33;22:36;"But anyway, as you can imagine,"
22:36;22:40;"if you get like two people who are above six feet"
22:40;22:41;"and they have the same name,"
22:41;22:44;"many times over the years people say,"
22:44;22:46;"oh, which one of you is taller?"
22:46;22:48;"It looks like CT's taller."
22:48;22:51;"And famously the answer is no, Bayo's taller."
22:51;22:53;"Bayo's the tallest one in the band."
22:53;22:55;"And so they kind of have like a bit about it,"
22:55;22:57;"like when they're pretending,"
22:57;22:58;"like they're answering that question"
22:58;22:59;"for the millionth time."
22:59;23:00;"And they're just like, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
23:00;23:02;"he carries himself with more,"
23:02;23:04;"he carries himself differently."
23:04;23:06;"- CT has got excellent posture."
23:06;23:09;"- CT's got excellent posture and you know,"
23:09;23:11;"Bayo's like, he's really into running"
23:11;23:13;"and he can run all over town."
23:13;23:14;"CT's always been more of an athlete."
23:14;23:16;"You know, he was like high school,"
23:16;23:18;"captain of the high school basketball team."
23:18;23:22;"So I wonder if also his like athletic nature reads into it"
23:22;23:24;"or because Bayo's taller,"
23:24;23:26;"maybe he slumps a little bit more"
23:26;23:28;"'cause sometimes tall people don't wanna be"
23:28;23:30;"towering over everybody."
23:30;23:33;"So anyway, that's come up many times for people like,"
23:33;23:34;"oh, it looks like he's taller."
23:34;23:38;"Actually, no, he's just got more tall guy energy."
23:38;23:40;"This is the tallest guy."
23:40;23:42;"- If you were to tell me drums or bass,"
23:42;23:45;"which have a taller guy energy, I would say drums."
23:45;23:46;"- I would say bass,"
23:46;23:48;"but that's 'cause I'm thinking of Chris Novoselic"
23:48;23:50;"who is two feet taller than Kurt."
23:50;23:54;"- By the way, you know who has,"
23:54;23:57;"truly not 'cause we have to call him into Segway,"
23:57;23:59;"but you know who has really tall guy energy?"
23:59;24:00;"Is Dave."
24:00;24:02;"- Dave Mclevish."
24:02;24:03;"Lead singer of Chromio."
24:03;24:04;"Let's get him on the horn."
24:04;24:07;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
24:07;24:12;"- We should ask him how tall he is."
24:12;24:14;"If you were to ask me, I'd say he's six two."
24:14;24:15;"- Yeah, actually, I don't know."
24:15;24:18;"Yeah, I think Dave, I think of Dave as being taller."
24:18;24:21;"- If you told me he was somehow five nine,"
24:21;24:24;"I still wouldn't disbelieve it 'cause I just feel like,"
24:24;24:26;"oh man, this guy presents so tall."
24:26;24:27;"- Yo, yo."
24:27;24:28;"- Hey, what's up? - There he is."
24:28;24:30;"- Hi."
24:30;24:32;"- Welcome back to Time Crisis."
24:32;24:37;"My dear friend and legendary singer of Chromio, DJ, Dave1."
24:37;24:40;"Question number one, how tall are you?"
24:40;24:41;"- Six four."
24:41;24:43;"- Whoa, wait, yeah."
24:43;24:44;"- What did I say?"
24:44;24:47;"Did I say six two or six four?"
24:47;24:48;"- You said six two."
24:48;24:50;"- Damn, I told you he was tall."
24:50;24:53;"- We were just talking about, you're six four?"
24:53;24:55;"- Somewhere in between six three and six four, yeah."
24:55;24:56;"- That's shocking."
24:56;24:58;"Congratulations."
24:58;24:59;"- Thank you, thank you."
24:59;25:01;"- I gotta say, I'm six two and a bit,"
25:01;25:03;"and it always trips me out"
25:03;25:05;"when someone's a little taller than me"
25:05;25:07;"'cause I'm used to being, you know what I'm saying?"
25:07;25:09;"And I'm like, that's not allowed."
25:09;25:11;"- Sorry."
25:11;25:13;"- Are guys from Montreal tall?"
25:13;25:15;"'Cause you're both from Montreal."
25:15;25:17;"(laughing)"
25:17;25:19;"- They come in all shapes."
25:19;25:21;"- Guys from Montreal are not particularly tall."
25:21;25:25;"My mom feels like people in New York are taller."
25:25;25:28;"Whenever she comes to New York, she's like,"
25:28;25:30;"""Wow, everybody's tall here."""
25:30;25:31;"- I mean, she would know."
25:31;25:34;"Walking the streets of Montreal and then coming to New York."
25:34;25:36;"Maybe New York is a taller city."
25:36;25:39;"And so, were you ever athletic?"
25:39;25:41;"- Never athletic."
25:41;25:42;"- Right, you've always been--"
25:42;25:44;"You've always been kind of bookish."
25:44;25:49;"- Bookish, I had this big cycling phase in high school."
25:49;25:51;"That was like a huge thing for me."
25:51;25:56;"And then I was bookish, I was music-ish."
25:56;25:58;"You know, a little bit of skateboarding"
25:58;26:02;"and then big into cycling and mountain biking."
26:02;26:04;"And that was a phase and it went away."
26:04;26:05;"And then that's about it."
26:05;26:06;"Just music."
26:06;26:07;"- When you're over six three,"
26:07;26:09;"don't you often get people trying to just draft you"
26:09;26:11;"into basketball?"
26:11;26:12;"- Not when you go to a French lycee"
26:12;26:15;"and there's nothing close to basketball or sports."
26:15;26:16;"- Explain that."
26:16;26:20;"So a French lycee, this is your Montreal high school?"
26:20;26:21;"- Yeah, high school, yeah."
26:21;26:26;"So from grade, let's see, grade seven to 11, I guess."
26:26;26:32;"There wasn't really much of any after school sports programs"
26:32;26:33;"or anything like that."
26:33;26:36;"- And Seinfeld, you went to an English language school?"
26:36;26:37;"- No, no, it was French."
26:37;26:38;"It was a French lycee."
26:38;26:39;"- No, no, I'm asking Seinfeld."
26:39;26:41;"A, B, the Montreal experience."
26:41;26:42;"- Oh, Seinfeld, oh, hi Seinfeld."
26:42;26:44;"- Hey, what's up?"
26:44;26:47;"Yeah, I was in a French immersion school in elementary,"
26:47;26:48;"but yeah."
26:48;26:50;"- You went to an English language high school."
26:50;26:52;"Was your school more like an American school"
26:52;26:56;"with basketball and sports and cheerleaders?"
26:56;26:57;"- Oh yeah."
26:57;26:59;"- Yeah, we didn't have anything like that."
26:59;27:00;"- Right, it's 'cause, yeah,"
27:00;27:02;"that's always trips me out about Montreal."
27:02;27:07;"Just like alternate linguistic realities, cultural."
27:07;27:10;"- Cultural realities, and ours was even more radical"
27:10;27:13;"'cause it was like, you know, French curriculum,"
27:13;27:16;"French teachers, kids from all over the world."
27:16;27:20;"Like there was very little locals."
27:20;27:21;"- Right, so yours was French language,"
27:21;27:26;"but not particularly the French Canadian, Quebecois people."
27:26;27:30;"- No, no, maybe one or two per class, that's it."
27:30;27:31;"- Right."
27:31;27:32;"- Right."
27:32;27:34;"- Congratulations on the new album."
27:34;27:35;"- Thank you."
27:35;27:36;"- It's great."
27:36;27:37;"- Thank you."
27:37;27:40;"- You started giving me feedback on it"
27:40;27:42;"and then you abruptly stopped."
27:42;27:44;"So I was like, oof, past song number four"
27:44;27:47;"doesn't get that great, but thanks for confirming."
27:47;27:48;"- I was past song four."
27:48;27:49;"Yeah, I was just--"
27:49;27:50;"- Five."
27:50;27:53;"- Then I had to go do other stuff."
27:53;27:54;"Great album."
27:54;27:55;"I've already talked on the show about my love"
27:55;27:57;"for ""Personal Effects."""
27:57;27:58;"- Yeah."
27:58;28:01;"- That's an all-time Chromium song for me."
28:01;28:02;"- Thank you."
28:02;28:04;"- Everybody should check out the album."
28:04;28:07;"- Dicey territory to start giving feedback"
28:07;28:09;"to your close friend."
28:09;28:09;"- That's true, yeah."
28:09;28:10;"Just recently."
28:10;28:13;"- You know, it's really, you know,"
28:13;28:14;"second half of the record."
28:14;28:15;"- Yeah."
28:15;28:16;"- You left Dave hanging."
28:16;28:18;"- Yeah, I still feel like that."
28:18;28:20;"Ezra, you remember when you played me your album,"
28:20;28:22;"I listened to the whole thing twice."
28:22;28:24;"Whole thing."
28:24;28:25;"And then we talked."
28:25;28:26;"You called me actually."
28:26;28:30;"You were very, very, very nervous about what I had to say."
28:30;28:32;"But you know, I figured, I know there's a second text"
28:32;28:34;"coming down the line at some point."
28:34;28:36;"- The second text is coming."
28:36;28:38;"- There's a second coming."
28:38;28:41;"- I'm sure you're all talked out about the album."
28:41;28:42;"Like, people listen to ""Time Crisis,"""
28:42;28:45;"they know we love Chromio."
28:45;28:46;"They should go check it out."
28:46;28:47;"- That's nice."
28:47;28:48;"- You've been all over the world"
28:48;28:50;"promoting the record recently."
28:50;28:52;"About to go back on tour."
28:52;28:53;"- Yeah."
28:53;28:54;"- All over the US."
28:54;28:54;"- Yeah."
28:54;28:56;"- But there was something we were talking--"
28:56;28:57;"- Yeah."
28:57;28:57;"- Tell me, tell me."
28:57;28:59;"No, go on, we're doing Europe too,"
28:59;29:00;"and a little bit of Mexico."
29:00;29:02;"It's gonna be fun."
29:02;29:03;"The whole shebang."
29:03;29:05;"- Also, I don't know if people understand too,"
29:05;29:08;"that Chromio is one of the great live bands"
29:08;29:10;"of the 21st century."
29:10;29:12;"And actually, I don't know if we ever talked about it"
29:12;29:15;"on the show, you released a live record two years ago."
29:15;29:18;"- Yeah, I mean, playing live is like a big thing with us."
29:18;29:21;"We've always had our,"
29:21;29:26;"we've always had our share of kind of doubters and skeptics."
29:26;29:28;"And usually when they see us live,"
29:29;29:34;"that's when they become a little converted, I would say."
29:34;29:37;"Where like some of the skepticism, you know,"
29:37;29:39;"dwindles, dissipates."
29:39;29:41;"So yeah."
29:41;29:43;"- Yeah, and I think you get a lot of repeat customers"
29:43;29:46;"because the show's so fun."
29:46;29:48;"Like every tour, you always put a lot of thought into it."
29:48;29:51;"And it's like kind of a dance party,"
29:51;29:53;"always like a really cool set."
29:53;29:54;"- Yeah."
29:54;29:55;"- You and Peter are great performers."
29:55;29:57;"- Yeah, a lot gets put into it."
29:57;30:00;"A lot of like set design and yeah, it's, you know,"
30:00;30:03;"we grew up in that era where, you know,"
30:03;30:06;"the show is just as important as the music,"
30:06;30:08;"is just as important as the font,"
30:08;30:09;"is just as important as the artwork,"
30:09;30:11;"is just as important as the outfits."
30:11;30:14;"You know, it's like, it's like the Ramones."
30:14;30:17;"Like you have to have the whole thing, you know?"
30:17;30:18;"- Right."
30:18;30:21;"- I saw you guys live once in the early 2000s,"
30:21;30:23;"2007 or so."
30:23;30:25;"And you know, I can attest to everything you're saying,"
30:25;30:26;"'cause it was like, it was a true party."
30:26;30:27;"You guys were like, it was very democratic."
30:27;30:31;"You were like with the crowd almost, as I recall."
30:31;30:32;"It was a fun, it was a fun night."
30:32;30:33;"- Was that in Montreal?"
30:33;30:34;"- That was in Toronto."
30:34;30:35;"Toronto, yeah."
30:35;30:37;"- Oh, wow, cool."
30:37;30:38;"Oh, I know where that was."
30:38;30:41;"That was on the second floor of some weird kind of..."
30:41;30:42;"- That's right."
30:42;30:44;"- Oh yeah, that was like, those were the,"
30:44;30:46;"that was peak indie sleaze era."
30:46;30:47;"- Yes, that's right."
30:47;30:48;"That's right."
30:48;30:49;"There was like, there was like no stage almost."
30:49;30:50;"- Nope, no stage."
30:50;30:52;"- I just remember, yeah, yeah, yeah."
30:52;30:54;"- Yeah, that was cool."

31:34;31:36;"- One thing we were just talking about earlier, Dave,"
31:36;31:40;"just to really bring you fully into the mix of time crisis,"
31:40;31:43;"which I said recently, for all the Bill Maher fans,"
31:43;31:45;"this is the real club random."
31:45;31:47;"We've been keeping it random since day one."
31:47;31:48;"- Yeah."
31:48;31:51;"- Bill Maher's trying to get random now on Club Random."
31:51;31:53;"But we were just talking about gift giving."
31:53;31:56;"(laughing)"
31:56;31:59;"And how I got all the guys for Christmas,"
31:59;32:03;"the time crisis crew, vintage shirts,"
32:03;32:05;"and I nailed Jake's so well."
32:05;32:07;"I got him a vintage Steve Forbert shirt."
32:07;32:08;"Do you know who that is?"
32:08;32:09;"- No, who's that?"
32:09;32:12;"- He was like a late 70s singer songwriter,"
32:12;32:14;"doing kind of like traditional songwriting,"
32:14;32:15;"but in the era of punk."
32:15;32:17;"And he has this song called ""Romeo's Tune"""
32:17;32:18;"that people like a lot."
32:18;32:20;"But it's a bit random."
32:20;32:21;"So to find like a vintage shirt"
32:21;32:24;"that just says the guy's name, Steve Forbert, in red,"
32:24;32:27;"it's like a picture of him, fit Jake perfectly."
32:27;32:29;"But then it was really hard to come up with stuff"
32:29;32:30;"for the other guys,"
32:30;32:34;"to the point that I was looking at vintage Montreal shirts"
32:34;32:36;"on eBay for Seinfeld."
32:36;32:40;"Just like, and I ended up giving Nick the Montreal."
32:40;32:44;"But anyway, you are always, I've always considered,"
32:44;32:47;"you've always been a man of taste."
32:47;32:51;"I did a great interview recently in ""Blackbird Spy Plan,"""
32:51;32:52;"which everybody should check out,"
32:52;32:53;"where you're talking about your love"
32:53;32:58;"of Brazilian mid-century furniture, vintage magazines."
32:58;33:01;"You know, you've always been a huge influence in my life."
33:01;33:03;"You're somebody who knows what's up."
33:03;33:04;"So it's funny, as we were talking about it,"
33:04;33:06;"and you're coming on the show, I was like,"
33:06;33:08;"you seem like somebody who probably"
33:08;33:10;"is really good at gift giving."
33:10;33:14;"I find it such an anxiety-inducing experience."
33:14;33:18;"I feel like I nail it one in every 12 times."
33:18;33:19;"But do you like giving gifts?"
33:19;33:22;"Are you a master? - I love it."
33:22;33:25;"I hope so, I definitely love it."
33:25;33:30;"And when Christmas time comes and I have to do,"
33:30;33:32;"hit off all my managers and my booking agent"
33:32;33:34;"and my booking agent's assistant,"
33:34;33:38;"and everybody in our orbit, I take great pleasure."
33:38;33:40;"I love it."
33:40;33:42;"- So what, okay, so for somebody like"
33:42;33:45;"the booking agent's assistant or something,"
33:45;33:48;"like, you know, who's somebody who probably"
33:48;33:50;"you appreciate them so much and all the hard work they do,"
33:50;33:53;"they're not like an old friend that you're gonna get"
33:53;33:54;"a vintage Steve Forbert shirt,"
33:54;33:56;"'cause you know they're gonna find it."
33:56;33:58;"Yeah, so with somebody like that, how do you not just,"
33:58;34:00;"that's the exact type of person I'd be like,"
34:00;34:03;"oh God, what do I, and then like, you go to a gift,"
34:03;34:05;"you look on a gift-giving website,"
34:05;34:07;"and it's always gonna be a candle"
34:07;34:08;"or something kinda like--"
34:08;34:10;"- Well, I do two things."
34:10;34:15;"So I have people, like for instance, my book,"
34:15;34:19;"is it, this is like, this is time crisis material,"
34:19;34:21;"this kinda stuff, I just wanna make sure I'm not like--"
34:21;34:22;"- I think this is--"
34:22;34:23;"- This is great."
34:23;34:24;"- This is great. - Peak, yeah."
34:24;34:29;"- Okay, so like for instance, my touring agent,"
34:29;34:34;"like sort of assistant, I went with a theme of like,"
34:34;34:39;"you must love hotels and you must love the finer hotels,"
34:39;34:43;"and so you must love the Soho House robe,"
34:43;34:45;"because when you go to Soho House,"
34:45;34:47;"the robes are real plush and real nice,"
34:47;34:50;"and you know, like Soho House, they have their own brand,"
34:50;34:52;"that you can get on like Mr. Porter or whatever,"
34:52;34:56;"it's like, they have their own homeware"
34:56;34:59;"and toiletries or whatnot,"
34:59;35:01;"and so I got him a Soho House robe,"
35:01;35:04;"so that was kind of just a little bit of a tailored thing,"
35:04;35:07;"and then if I'm gonna give, like for my main,"
35:07;35:10;"for Sam Hunt, for my main touring agent,"
35:10;35:13;"in his case, it is kind of candle adjacent stuff,"
35:13;35:16;"but it's a motif every year,"
35:16;35:19;"so every year he knows he's gonna get"
35:19;35:22;"a sort of like a, you know, a scented something,"
35:22;35:25;"it might be like, you know, scented steaks or whatever,"
35:25;35:27;"like oils for the house."
35:27;35:29;"- So the theme for him is scented?"
35:29;35:34;"- For, well, for him, the theme is like home sophistication,"
35:35;35:37;"so you know, like I might, next year,"
35:37;35:40;"I might get him something that's not a candle,"
35:40;35:42;"but he knows, and he's always writing me like,"
35:42;35:45;"""Oh, you make my home so much classier every year,"""
35:45;35:48;"you know, so that's an inside joke that I could repeat,"
35:48;35:51;"so the thing is, what I was gonna say for gift giving"
35:51;35:54;"is one good sort of, I don't wanna say a cop-out,"
35:54;35:58;"but it is a cop-out, is if you start developing,"
35:58;35:59;"if you do a pattern,"
35:59;36:02;"then you don't have to stress every year,"
36:02;36:05;"and the person that gets your gift, yeah,"
36:05;36:06;"like for instance, my accountant,"
36:06;36:09;"my accountant loves to ski."
36:09;36:13;"Every year, I get him one piece of ski gear, right?"
36:13;36:17;"So it could be a pair of gloves, a pair of goggles,"
36:17;36:20;"some like a cool little like ski jacket,"
36:20;36:22;"a backpack to go ski, so I don't have to think that much,"
36:22;36:26;"I just gotta refresh the paradigm, you know,"
36:26;36:27;"and I think that's a good solution."
36:27;36:29;"- Hearing you talk, I'm also just thinking"
36:29;36:31;"about all the people that probably should be getting gifts"
36:31;36:36;"more regularly, but I get paralyzed by fear,"
36:36;36:38;"and I don't have any of these."
36:38;36:40;"- I can't believe you give a gift to your accountant,"
36:40;36:41;"that's amazing."
36:41;36:43;"- I think that should be the first person"
36:43;36:45;"you give a gift to, honestly."
36:45;36:46;"I think that--"
36:46;36:48;"- That would never occur to me."
36:48;36:49;"- No, you're--"
36:49;36:52;"- Jesus, Jesus Christ, this is, I gotta tell you."
36:52;36:52;"- Dave is a classic."
36:52;36:54;"- My mind is blown."
36:54;36:55;"- Why?"
36:55;36:56;"- I just--"
36:56;36:57;"- Your accountant, you're, of all people,"
36:57;36:58;"your accountant's the first guy."
36:58;37:00;"- No, no, no, not the accountant part."
37:00;37:03;"You're right, I'm actually, I feel terrible"
37:03;37:05;"that that's not what I'm thinking,"
37:05;37:07;"you know, that that person doesn't cross my mind."
37:07;37:09;"- Top five people."
37:09;37:11;"- But I totally get it, I follow the logic."
37:11;37:14;"I'm just sort of more, this entire,"
37:14;37:19;"this gift-giving ecosystem, it's just, it's good, dude."
37:19;37:20;"I don't know, I feel--"
37:20;37:22;"- No, it's tough because--"
37:22;37:23;"- I feel like I've missed a lot of opportunity."
37:23;37:27;"- And also, giving gifts is,"
37:27;37:30;"it does mean something to people,"
37:30;37:33;"and you don't wanna give somebody something thoughtless,"
37:33;37:34;"but--"
37:34;37:35;"- No, you can't, yeah."
37:35;37:38;"- That's why I was kinda like, sometimes discovering,"
37:38;37:41;"oh, like these websites where you can send somebody"
37:41;37:44;"a Christmas-themed food, kinda,"
37:44;37:46;"if you looked at my gift-giving, it's so sporadic."
37:46;37:49;"It's like one year, that guy got a Christmas present,"
37:49;37:52;"and next year, somebody got a birthday present, and--"
37:52;37:54;"- Yeah, but think about it, imagine all these people"
37:54;37:57;"who are so excited every year"
37:57;37:59;"because they're gonna get this thing from Dave,"
37:59;38:02;"and they know it now, and they're excited--"
38:02;38:03;"- My manager's like that."
38:03;38:06;"I love it, I find great pleasure in it."
38:06;38:09;"I had a tour manager for a long time,"
38:09;38:10;"like we had him for a few years,"
38:10;38:14;"and I would always give him sort of conspiracy books,"
38:14;38:17;"but not, you know, not, but not like,"
38:17;38:20;"not like, you know, not too far off."
38:20;38:23;"- Like ""Chaos"" by Tom O'Neill, do you know that one?"
38:23;38:24;"It's the one about the Manson murders."
38:24;38:25;"- I don't know that one."
38:25;38:26;"- Well, that's a good one for next year."
38:26;38:28;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, I got that one,"
38:28;38:29;"I got that one, yeah, actually, Ezra,"
38:29;38:31;"you recommended that to me, and I read it."
38:31;38:34;"Exactly that, exactly that."
38:34;38:38;"Or some, or like some kind of Afghanistan-related stuff."
38:38;38:43;"You know, and it was cool, it was our little interaction,"
38:43;38:45;"and yeah, I would recommend that, Ezra."
38:45;38:50;"I would recommend finding sort of these through lines"
38:50;38:52;"with all the people you know,"
38:52;38:54;"based on one thing that you know is their interest,"
38:54;38:56;"and even if it doesn't even,"
38:56;38:58;"if it's not even their interest after a while,"
38:58;39:00;"they know that that's gonna be their lane with you,"
39:00;39:02;"so they kind of expect the inside joke,"
39:02;39:04;"how are you gonna renew it this year?"
39:04;39:06;"And every year is a little variation,"
39:06;39:07;"and that's enough to keep them happy."

39:51;39:53;"it's more than, you know, they're friends,"
39:53;39:56;"it's not always just like in some industries,"
39:56;39:57;"all right, that's a guy I work with,"
39:57;40:01;"there's a closeness, but let's go one step beyond."
40:01;40:05;"Family, your girl, these kind of people."
40:05;40:10;"How about for your brother, world famous DJ, A-Trak,"
40:10;40:15;"like, what do you get in him for the holidays?"
40:15;40:16;"- That changes every year."
40:16;40:19;"- 'Cause you know him so well that you,"
40:19;40:21;"but what's your way of thinking about that?"
40:21;40:25;"- I assess what his needs are each year."
40:25;40:29;"Like last year I was like, bro, your bedsheets are crap."
40:29;40:31;"You have really whack bedsheets."
40:31;40:33;"So I got him like the best, best sheets I knew,"
40:33;40:36;"like the best, best, best bedsheets I could think of."
40:36;40:38;"And then I was like, if you like him in New York,"
40:38;40:40;"you should get him for yourself in LA."
40:40;40:42;"You know, that was like my whole thing with him."
40:42;40:44;"- What's the thread count on those?"
40:44;40:45;"- No, it's not, it's not."
40:45;40:46;"- Oh, it's not a thread count."
40:46;40:47;"- No, no, it's not."
40:47;40:50;"That doesn't apply to linen."
40:50;40:52;"It's post thread."
40:52;40:53;"- Oh, I thought you could do, oh."
40:53;40:56;"- Oh, it's a linen, it's a linen material."
40:56;40:59;"Oh yeah, I like a linen bedspread."
40:59;41:00;"It's very nice."
41:00;41:03;"- Okay, see, now I'm making a note."
41:03;41:06;"I mean, you know, maybe I'll start you off"
41:06;41:08;"with just like one of the, I mean, those are,"
41:08;41:10;"yeah, you just like pay attention."
41:10;41:12;"- Not a joke, not a joke though."
41:12;41:14;"Do you take any notes about that?"
41:14;41:16;"I mean, it sounds like you're buying gifts"
41:16;41:17;"for so many people."
41:17;41:18;"- Oh yeah, you keep track of it all."
41:18;41:20;"- Do you note this, yeah."
41:20;41:24;"- So at the end of the year, I do have a note."
41:24;41:27;"Yeah, in December, I start making a note"
41:27;41:30;"of everybody I wanna get a gift for."
41:30;41:32;"My whole thing with gifts is that like,"
41:32;41:35;"I don't expect a gift back."
41:35;41:38;"What I always think and sometimes say"
41:38;41:40;"is pay me back with loyalty."
41:40;41:45;"And I think when you give gifts regularly"
41:45;41:47;"to people around you that work with you,"
41:47;41:51;"I think you gain loyalty points."
41:51;41:52;"- It's a mafia (beep)"
41:52;41:53;"- That's heavy duty."
41:53;41:55;"- I don't need a robe, I don't need a candle,"
41:55;41:57;"but one day I may ask you to do something."
41:57;41:58;"And when that day comes."
41:58;42:03;"- No, no, it's more like one day I might,"
42:03;42:07;"one day, I don't know, Ezra,"
42:07;42:08;"one day some other corny ass band"
42:08;42:10;"might wanna be on your roster"
42:10;42:12;"and you might have to turn them down."
42:12;42:13;"I don't know."
42:13;42:14;"- Right, no, who knows?"
42:14;42:15;"- I don't know."
42:15;42:18;"- No, no, you're showing loyalty in a basic sense"
42:18;42:21;"in that you're like,"
42:21;42:25;"when you get somebody a regular gift,"
42:25;42:26;"it shows at the end of the year"
42:26;42:28;"when I'm taking stock of my life,"
42:28;42:30;"you're somebody I think about."
42:30;42:31;"- Yeah."
42:31;42:31;"- And that's nice."
42:31;42:34;"- You know what, it's not even about them"
42:34;42:37;"turning down a corny band 'cause that's actually,"
42:37;42:42;"I think we're past that point in our lives"
42:42;42:43;"and in our careers."
42:43;42:47;"I think it's more like they know that working for us is hard."
42:47;42:49;"It's sometimes a pain in the ass."
42:49;42:51;"We're a very demanding band."
42:51;42:56;"We're very, very rigorous in all aspects of our work."
42:56;42:59;"And I know that P and I can be a lot."
42:59;43:01;"And this is my way of saying, thank you."
43:01;43:03;"Let's keep it going."
43:03;43:05;"And I think for a lot of people in our team,"
43:05;43:06;"they're like, damn, man,"
43:06;43:09;"Dave literally writes us cards, gives us gifts."
43:09;43:11;"He's thoughtful."
43:11;43:12;"Yeah, it's a lot to deal with him and P,"
43:12;43:14;"but this dude's a mensch."
43:14;43:17;"- Yeah, 'cause I guess when you take the balance"
43:17;43:19;"of the year, maybe you call people more"
43:19;43:20;"than some of their other clients"
43:20;43:23;"'cause you're like, you got stuff on your mind"
43:23;43:25;"and whatever, and you wanna say, yeah, it's nice to say,"
43:25;43:26;"I recognize that."
43:26;43:28;"I might call you more than some people."
43:28;43:31;"I might be stressing about something you think is small,"
43:31;43:33;"but I recognize that."
43:33;43:36;"And I appreciate that you've shown loyalty to me"
43:36;43:37;"throughout all that."
43:37;43:37;"- Yep."

44:40;44:42;"that bears fruit or vegetables?"
44:42;44:44;"'Cause that's the gift that keeps on giving."
44:44;44:48;"- It is, I thought, but that's actually out of my wheelhouse."
44:48;44:53;"But not because I don't appreciate the sort of symbolism"
44:53;44:57;"or the pun, it's because I'm really not like sort"
44:57;44:59;"of a horty horticulturist."
44:59;45:01;"Like I just don't have that knowledge,"
45:01;45:04;"but actually that'd be dope."

45:13;45:15;"I don't know if it's basil or something like that."
45:15;45:17;"And they might, that might be really cool."
45:17;45:19;"- Every time they taste it, they think of you."
45:19;45:22;"- Yeah."
45:22;45:23;"- You know, Dave, actually it's funny."
45:23;45:24;"It came up recently."
45:24;45:27;"There's a gift that you gave in my household"
45:27;45:29;"that actually we talk about quite a bit."
45:29;45:34;"And that's when our son was born, you gave him cologne."
45:34;45:35;"- Yep."
45:35;45:36;"- Wow."
45:36;45:37;"- Sick."
45:37;45:39;"(laughing)"
45:39;45:39;"- Wait, hold on."
45:39;45:41;"What kind of cologne do you give a baby?"
45:41;45:43;"- It was baby cologne."
45:43;45:47;"It was from Jacadi, which makes clothes"
45:47;45:49;"for babies and children and stuff."
45:49;45:54;"And we, you were the only person who gave him cologne,"
45:54;45:56;"but then you also, it was, we always think of you"
45:56;45:58;"because you, and you know, every once in a blue moon,"
45:58;46:00;"he'll like spray it in his room and smell it"
46:00;46:01;"'cause he still has it."
46:01;46:03;"'Cause yeah, of course he wasn't like wearing it every day"
46:03;46:05;"as a baby, so there's a bunch left,"
46:05;46:08;"but it was, we always remember that"
46:08;46:10;"because that way you also taught us that that's,"
46:10;46:16;"that's pretty normal in French culture."
46:16;46:17;"- Mediterranean."
46:17;46:18;"There's two things."
46:18;46:19;"And I remember, I actually wanted to give him"
46:19;46:23;"something else, but you guys pushed back a little bit."
46:23;46:24;"- Wait, what was that?"
46:24;46:28;"- I wanted to give him a little name bracelet."
46:28;46:29;"And--"
46:29;46:29;"- Oh, you know what?"
46:29;46:30;"That's funny."
46:30;46:31;"That's how this all came up because actually,"
46:31;46:35;"speaking of gifts giving, I, for Rashida's birthday,"
46:35;46:38;"which was last week, I was like,"
46:38;46:40;"I'm gonna get her some jewelry."
46:40;46:43;"And I went to a cool, funky place and I was looking at stuff"
46:43;46:46;"and I knew she liked a certain kind of color or something."
46:46;46:48;"And this woman said, oh, here's an idea."
46:48;46:51;"These are these Victorian baby rings"
46:51;46:53;"that you could put together for a necklace."
46:53;46:54;"And we kind of made like a cool necklace."
46:54;46:58;"But then of course we start talking about baby jewelry"
46:58;47:00;"and that's what led to this whole conversation."
47:00;47:03;"'Cause obviously babies tend not to wear rings"
47:03;47:05;"as much these days."
47:05;47:07;"But it used to be a real thing in many different cultures,"
47:07;47:09;"putting jewelry on babies."
47:09;47:11;"But of course in modern times,"
47:11;47:13;"most people think of it as a choking hazard."
47:13;47:16;"So there's probably some part of it of even baby"
47:16;47:20;"having a little bracelet probably just like freaked us out."
47:20;47:21;"'Cause it's just like--"
47:21;47:22;"- You guys weren't into it."
47:22;47:24;"Yeah, you guys were not into it."
47:24;47:25;"- No, it's thoughtful."
47:25;47:26;"I think it probably just freaked us out."
47:26;47:29;"- Yeah, but if you're like for Moroccans or French people"
47:29;47:32;"or Italian people, Lebanese, P, like P and I,"
47:32;47:34;"every baby's got a little name bracelet."
47:34;47:35;"- Always, always."
47:35;47:37;"And there's a French word for it."
47:37;47:38;"It's called a gourmet."
47:38;47:42;"And it's something that you have like,"
47:42;47:44;"I don't know, the minute you're like two or three years old,"
47:44;47:46;"there's like a tiny, it's a very fine bracelet"
47:46;47:48;"with like a little name plate"
47:48;47:50;"and your name is written in cursive."
47:50;47:55;"And yeah, like I had one, like P had one,"
47:55;47:57;"my brother had one, everyone."
47:57;47:59;"And that's usually a nice gift."
47:59;48:00;"You guys did not like that."
48:00;48:04;"- So I guess for you, between the baby bracelet"
48:04;48:09;"and the cologne, you never have to think too hard"
48:09;48:12;"about what to get when there's a new baby on the scene."
48:12;48:15;"- It's weird, like I do ask my mom usually."
48:15;48:18;"Well, it depends, like, yeah, clothing is great."
48:18;48:22;"I have a goddaughter who turned three"
48:22;48:25;"and usually I always give her clothing,"
48:25;48:27;"but this time for the first time on her birthday,"
48:27;48:28;"I gave her a Casio."
48:28;48:30;"And I thought that was like really dope."
48:30;48:33;"And luckily I went to B&H and I found-"
48:33;48:34;"- A Casio what?"
48:34;48:35;"- No, no, a Casio keyboard."
48:35;48:37;"Like we've all like a- - Oh, oh, oh."
48:37;48:40;"- Yeah, a Casio, every kid's gotta have a Casio."
48:40;48:43;"I'll just think of like every kid has to have a Casio,"
48:43;48:46;"but also, you know, when we were babies,"
48:46;48:49;"like my mom used to always spray baby cologne on us."
48:49;48:50;"That's like a thing."
48:50;48:51;"- Yeah."
48:51;48:52;"- And watch with Isaiah,"
48:52;48:54;"bet you it's gonna bring him pleasure."
48:54;48:57;"Like it's like a little sensory thing."
48:57;48:58;"I'm gonna get him other ones."
48:58;49:00;"- When he remembers that, like, oh yeah,"
49:00;49:03;"it's in his dresser and he like takes it out"
49:03;49:04;"and he likes to spray it."
49:04;49:08;"- And it's very, I mean, I think that for kids,"
49:08;49:10;"and again, like I just think for kids,"
49:10;49:14;"like in Mediterranean cultures or like European cultures,"
49:14;49:17;"there's a lot of like little thoughtful, sweet nothings"
49:17;49:22;"or little things that are good baby gifts, you know?"
49:22;49:26;"- I like seeing a baby with the ears pierced sometimes,"
49:26;49:30;"adds a little sparkle, adds a little extra shine."
49:30;49:31;"- Oh yeah, there's some places"
49:31;49:34;"where the baby gets their ears pierced ASAP."
49:34;49:36;"- Very early, yeah, very early."
49:36;49:39;"That's, I mean, South Asian cultures, definitely."
49:39;49:41;"- What about for a significant other?"
49:41;49:45;"Like I imagine that also changes year to year."
49:45;49:47;"- You know, yeah."
49:47;49:49;"- Do you have any advice?"
49:49;49:51;"'Cause that's a big one for a lot of people out there."
49:51;49:53;"What do I get for my significant other?"
49:53;49:55;"- Yeah, for that one,"
49:55;49:59;"you have to start planting the seeds a few months in advance."
49:59;50:01;"I think that's the key."
50:01;50:04;"'Cause you know, they say like it's, you know, whatever,"
50:04;50:06;"when they say like it's the thought that counts,"
50:06;50:08;"but I don't think it's the thought,"
50:08;50:11;"it's the thought process that counts."
50:11;50:16;"So I think that like the more depth there is"
50:16;50:22;"in sort of the genealogy of the gift, if I can say,"
50:22;50:26;"the happier and the more meaningful it's gonna feel."
50:26;50:29;"- Right, so you're saying even if it's not"
50:29;50:30;"like a slam dunk, like,"
50:30;50:33;"and that became my favorite sweater of all time"
50:33;50:34;"that I wear every day,"
50:34;50:38;"the fact that the story behind it was coherent."
50:38;50:42;"- A need and a desire expressed over a long period of time"
50:42;50:47;"and also sometimes like an inside joke or a motif,"
50:47;50:50;"you know, so that there's either there's a buildup"
50:50;50:53;"or when the gift is given, the person's like,"
50:53;50:55;"oh my God, of course you were gonna give me,"
50:55;50:58;"this is awesome, you know, that thing."
50:58;51:03;"'Cause like one year I gave my fiance like a practical gift"
51:03;51:08;"and it's probably the gift, I gave her a Rimowa suitcase,"
51:08;51:11;"brand spanking new, silver, big box,"
51:11;51:14;"it was there in the house, what's in the box?"
51:14;51:16;"And she uses it all the time."
51:16;51:19;"In fact, she had a terrible suitcase before"
51:19;51:23;"and she probably thinks this is the most useful, best gift."
51:23;51:25;"I've never given her anything she's used more,"
51:25;51:28;"but she was kind of nonplussed when I gave it to her"
51:28;51:30;"because it came out of the blue,"
51:30;51:32;"she had never said, oh, I need a new suit,"
51:32;51:36;"it was just like, oh, well like, yeah, thanks dad."
51:36;51:40;"You know, like it had this thing, it didn't hit."
51:40;51:43;"- I love, this is very classic time crisis"
51:43;51:44;"that we're just always kind of like out of step"
51:44;51:49;"with the time that we're doing like a really thoughtful"
51:49;51:54;"gift giving guide in like late winter."
51:54;51:56;"- Just literally, no, no, I've already been,"
51:56;51:58;"there's literally, there isn't a Valentine,"
51:58;52:03;"there's nothing, there's no moment to give a gift."
52:03;52:05;"- I mean, there's probably some sales,"
52:05;52:07;"there's probably some really good sales going on."
52:07;52:10;"- I mean, well, who knows, maybe we inspired somebody"
52:10;52:11;"to start making their list now."
52:11;52:13;"I mean, if I think about myself,"
52:13;52:15;"I should probably make a list now"
52:15;52:18;"for like end of the year presents."
52:18;52:21;"And I also feel like for me, maybe this isn't good,"
52:21;52:25;"but for me, I've also realized if I ever see something"
52:25;52:27;"that seems like novel, where I'm like,"
52:27;52:30;"oh, that's kind of a fun thing."
52:30;52:34;"As if it's not expensive, I should probably just buy it"
52:34;52:38;"and put it in a drawer because the next thing you know,"
52:38;52:41;"like, I don't know, like I found this website"
52:41;52:45;"that had a lot of kind of like gag gifts,"
52:45;52:48;"like world's smallest vacuum cleaner,"
52:48;52:52;"or a lollipop with a scorpion in it."
52:52;52:54;"- I don't know, Ezra."
52:54;52:57;"That's usually, that's the ancillary gift."
52:57;53:02;"Like for instance, my parents, for Christmas, they'll ask,"
53:02;53:04;"I mean, yeah, we give gifts for Christmas,"
53:04;53:06;"even though we're Jewish and stuff."
53:06;53:07;"- Yeah."
53:07;53:09;"- They'll be like the one gift you need,"
53:09;53:11;"like a new knife set."
53:11;53:12;"- Yeah."
53:12;53:13;"- Then there's the useless doodads,"
53:13;53:18;"which run the gamut from like maple syrup candy"
53:18;53:21;"to like an inside joke with the vacuum cleaner"
53:21;53:24;"to like, you know, some funny stuff,"
53:24;53:25;"socks with a funny pattern"
53:25;53:26;"that you know you're never gonna use."
53:26;53:31;"Like I wouldn't make the novelty gift the primary focus,"
53:31;53:33;"but like, I think that the vintage T-shirt thing"
53:33;53:35;"really suits everyone."
53:35;53:37;"- So maybe you just gotta buy that vintage T-shirt."
53:37;53:39;"- I felt very seen."
53:39;53:40;"- Yeah, you felt seen."
53:40;53:42;"So Jake, you're saying you felt super seen."
53:42;53:44;"Yeah, I mean, from the little I know of you,"
53:44;53:46;"this feels very on brand."
53:46;53:47;"- No, it was an incredible gift."
53:47;53:49;"I don't see that Steve Forbert shirt"
53:49;53:52;"probably like a top 10 gift I've received in my life."
53:52;53:53;"- Wow."
53:53;53:55;"- But that's exactly, 'cause you felt seen,"
53:55;53:59;"'cause Ezra dialed in on like the sort of niche interest."
53:59;54:01;"And now Ezra, what you gotta do"
54:01;54:03;"is not other Steve Forbert shirt,"
54:03;54:06;"is you're gonna have to up the ante."
54:06;54:10;"Well, or it's always some kind of singer songwriter"
54:10;54:13;"of that era, but it could be another piece of memorabilia,"
54:13;54:14;"it could be a mug,"
54:14;54:16;"and like you're gonna spend the whole year-"
54:16;54:17;"- It's a Fogelberg hoodie."

54:20;54:22;"♪ I wish she'd care to see ♪"
54:22;54:25;"♪ But she only cares when she's got the time ♪"
54:25;54:28;"♪ And I think so much about her love band ♪"

54:50;54:52;"But I'm too cool to admit it"
54:52;54:53;"When the fellows"
54:53;54:55;"Talk to my girl I ain't with it"
54:55;54:57;"I get jealous"
54:57;54:59;"But I'm too cool to admit it"
54:59;55:01;"When the fellows"
55:01;55:03;"Talk to my girl I ain't with it"
55:03;55:06;"I ain't with it"
55:06;55:09;"I ain't with it"
55:09;55:13;"I ain't with it"
55:13;55:15;"I ain't with it"
55:15;55:18;"I ain't with it"
55:18;55:21;"Actually, I don't want to put Ezra on the spot,"
55:21;55:24;"but I have witnessed Ezra give an equally thoughtful gift,"
55:24;55:27;"the Zodiac watch to Jake a few years ago."
55:27;55:28;"Oh, yeah, that's true."
55:28;55:31;"You know what's funny about that one?"
55:31;55:32;"So, dude, that's amazing."
55:32;55:33;"I know."
55:33;55:35;"I really need to step my game up."
55:35;55:36;"Jesus."
55:36;55:37;"No, no, but that was..."
55:37;55:40;"Jake, you got to start by lacing your accountant."
55:40;55:42;"I think that should be..."
55:42;55:43;"That should be top priority."
55:43;55:44;"Ezra's fine for a minute."
55:44;55:46;"You got it."
55:46;55:48;"You and Ezra's got some good stuff going on."
55:48;55:50;"There's a lot of love in the bank."
55:50;55:52;"I think the accountant, you need to hit him up."
55:52;55:55;"And also, there's definitely more onus on me."
55:55;55:58;"The show, maybe we should change it,"
55:58;56:01;"but the show is called ""Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."""
56:01;56:05;"You know, I got a do-right flagship by my guys."
56:05;56:07;"So, yeah, I don't expect..."
56:07;56:08;"Yeah, keep it."
56:08;56:10;"You want them to be loyal."
56:10;56:13;"You don't want them to pop up on another..."
56:13;56:15;"You know, it's like, this is the crew."
56:15;56:18;"They go on Elton John's radio show."
56:18;56:18;"Yeah."
56:18;56:19;"Yeah, but you know what's funny?"
56:19;56:23;"I got Jake a vintage Zodiac watch,"
56:23;56:25;"but it wasn't quite..."
56:25;56:26;"At the end of the day,"
56:26;56:28;"Jake is a man who loves wearing T-shirts."
56:28;56:29;"He's not a watch guy,"
56:29;56:32;"but Jake's favorite movie of all time, maybe,"
56:32;56:35;"is the film ""Zodiac"" about the Zodiac killer."
56:35;56:36;"Wow."
56:36;56:37;"Top five, for sure."
56:37;56:38;"That's cool."
56:38;56:39;"And, you know, that's the whole thing in the movie"
56:39;56:42;"is that the guy looks and he realizes"
56:42;56:44;"that they're interviewing a potential suspect"
56:44;56:46;"and he's wearing a Zodiac watch."
56:46;56:47;"And they realize, like, ""Wait a second."
56:47;56:51;"The Zodiac killer's logo probably came from the Zodiac watch."""
56:51;56:54;"So, you know, it was definitely tied into one of Jake's interests."
56:54;56:57;"But again, Jake might wear a T-shirt every day."
56:57;57:00;"How often is he going to want to throw on a vintage watch?"
57:00;57:01;"This just came up last week with Hannah"
57:01;57:04;"because we're going to a fancy wedding"
57:04;57:07;"in Minnesota this summer."
57:07;57:09;"And I'm going to be wearing a suit."
57:09;57:09;"Okay."
57:09;57:13;"And I said, ""Ooh, this is a great opportunity."
57:13;57:15;"I'm going to bust out the Zodiac watch."""
57:15;57:17;"I mean, that's great, Jake."
57:17;57:18;"That's amazing."
57:18;57:19;"And wear it with a suit."
57:19;57:22;"So it's, you know, it's not just sitting at the bottom of the drawer"
57:22;57:23;"forgotten about."
57:23;57:26;"It's just, you know, maybe once a year there's an opportunity for me."
57:26;57:28;"And that'll be a great conversation piece."
57:28;57:32;"I was just going to say, the conversation's going to be out of control."
57:32;57:33;"Talk to a guy at the table, like, ""What kind of watch is that?"""
57:33;57:36;"We'll say, ""All right, well, you know the Zodiac killer?"
57:36;57:38;"I'm a huge fan of his."""
57:38;57:39;"Yep."
57:39;57:40;"And all my friends know."
57:40;57:41;"That's exactly what it is."
57:41;57:43;"That's exactly what it is."
57:43;57:44;"It's amazing."
57:44;57:45;"That's really good."
57:45;57:48;"Okay, now that this actually is turning into a gift-giving guide"
57:48;57:50;"with Dave Maklovich, what about,"
57:50;57:52;"I know I'm going to hear some people listening,"
57:52;57:56;"hearing about, you know, some of the finer things."
57:56;57:58;"They're going to say, ""Well, listen, man,"
57:58;58:01;"I don't got a lot of money to spend on big brands."""
58:01;58:02;"Of course."
58:02;58:05;"What is your guide for the broke gift giver?"
58:05;58:06;"Two things."
58:06;58:08;"I think if there's, okay,"
58:08;58:11;"so if it's a significant other, obviously,"
58:11;58:12;"I know you guys are going to laugh a little bit,"
58:12;58:15;"but like a card, like a thoughtful card,"
58:15;58:17;"a thoughtful message, I think that's huge."
58:17;58:19;"Goes a very long way."
58:19;58:21;"Are you buying like a Hallmark card at CVS?"
58:21;58:22;"No, it doesn't matter."
58:22;58:23;"No, it doesn't."
58:23;58:25;"I mean, I might get a funny card."
58:25;58:27;"Those can be kind of cute, actually."
58:27;58:28;"Yeah, they're funny."
58:28;58:29;"Some of them are funny."
58:29;58:30;"The card just has to be vibey and funny."
58:30;58:31;"That's all."
58:31;58:32;"Yeah."
58:32;58:35;"You know, but then if you're on a budget,"
58:35;58:39;"I think you go the route of the inside joke."
58:39;58:43;"And I think, because again, like you said,"
58:43;58:45;"like it's about making the person feel seen."
58:45;58:47;"You can do that with not a lot."
58:47;58:52;"Let's, you know, if you know that this person loves Nutella,"
58:52;58:55;"you get them one of those giant Nutella jars."
58:55;58:58;"That's probably what, $25?"
58:58;58:59;"And like the person will be like,"
58:59;59:01;"""Oh my God, you get me."
59:01;59:02;"This is too funny."""
59:02;59:02;"Right."
59:02;59:03;"Yeah, I love that."
59:03;59:08;"That's going to run you anywhere from $38 to $90,"
59:08;59:10;"depending on the size of the jar."
59:10;59:11;"Are you pricing that out right now?"
59:11;59:13;"I'm doing a bit of a number crunch here."
59:13;59:14;"Yeah, number crunch."
59:14;59:17;"You're going to tell me the jumbo Nutella is $90?"
59:17;59:20;"I mean, I'm looking at one right now that's $200."
59:20;59:23;"Oh, that's some psychotically large one."
59:23;59:24;"That's crazy."
59:24;59:27;"But just like a nice, like even if it's a Costco size,"
59:27;59:28;"like it's cool, you know?"
59:28;59:31;"And I guess even if you really were on a crazy budget,"
59:31;59:33;"handmade card with a thoughtful note,"
59:33;59:36;"and then just two Nutellas wrapped up."
59:36;59:38;"Yeah, that's a great gift actually."
59:38;59:40;"If the person loves Nutella."
59:40;59:42;"Ezra, was it Netflix that sent us,"
59:42;59:43;"after we made Neo Yokio,"
59:43;59:47;"I felt like Netflix sent you the giant Toblerone."
59:47;59:47;"Yeah, that was thoughtful."
59:47;59:49;"That was like a very thoughtful,"
59:49;59:51;"especially from the network."
59:51;59:52;"I felt like so thoughtful."
59:52;59:53;"Yeah."
59:53;59:54;"They understood the thing."
59:54;59:56;"But again, I think what we're getting at with Dave here,"
59:56;59:58;"and again, not revelatory,"
59:58;01:00:03;"but the idea that it is truly the gift givers intention"
01:00:03;01:00:07;"is to like see something, make you feel seen."
01:00:07;01:00:11;"It really is not, that is not a monetary thing at all."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"No, no, not at all."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Not at all."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"I mean, Ezra, even on your birthday,"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"when I was like, okay, a Zabar's basket,"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"I'm like, okay, he hasn't been to New York in a while."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Zabar's is a big part of the universe."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"You've got this like super cool house."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"There's always, there's people coming by."
01:00:25;01:00:28;"There's all kinds of knickknacks in there that you can eat."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"I don't know when's the last time you had lox."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Like, you know, it's just like,"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"there's that little commonality, that little inside joke."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"I don't know if the gift landed,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"but to me it made sense, you know?"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"No, I love that."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Yeah, and it's fun."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"I don't think it's-"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"It's fun."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"I'm trying to think of,"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"I have some memory once of giving you"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"a Leonard Cohen record for your birthday."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"It was a Leonard Cohen live record."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"And it made me think of you."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"But yeah, but that's cool."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Like-"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"It wasn't a bullseye,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"but it's like, there's obviously the Montreal connection."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"It's this record where he looks really cool."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"He's got kind of a shaved head."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have it."
01:01:04;01:01:04;"Yeah, it's over there."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Yeah, I have it."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"Now to flip it around though,"
01:01:07;01:01:10;"what's one of the best gifts you've got in recent memory"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"that was like, oh wow, that's,"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"'cause what do you get the guy who has that?"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"I'm sure people are intimidated by you"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"because you're known to have such good taste."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"You're great at giving gifts."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"You're thoughtful."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And you put so much thought into the things that you buy."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"You know, every place you've ever lived that I've been to"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"is very neatly arranged."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"You have things the way you like it."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"You're not a hoarder."
01:01:32;01:01:35;"With clothes, you put so much thought into it."
01:01:35;01:01:40;"So it'd be a little daunting to buy you a shirt or something."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"Yeah, so how does that work when it's turned around?"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"Well, okay, but like, let's say,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"I'll give you two examples."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Not to say that,"
01:01:49;01:01:52;"like just first to start on like the meaningful thing,"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"the you and me, like the friend thing."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"I'm not trying to put you on the spot"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"or give you inspo for the next gift."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"But like, do you remember when we were both"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"at the Fleetwood Mac concert"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"and there was the Lindsey Buckingham,"
01:02:03;01:02:07;"she started shredding on one of like a solo,"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"not a solo song, but like one of his,"
01:02:08;01:02:11;"I mean, I remember the song, it was ""I'm So Afraid."""
01:02:11;01:02:12;"And then everybody that's been-"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- The riffs."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- The riffs, the chorus."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"And everybody that had been standing up"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"for the last few songs sat down."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"And then you looked back"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"and I was the only guy standing up with my eyes closed,"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"like really feeling it."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"(laughs)"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"You kind of commented on that."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Then it's like, okay, I remember you seeing that,"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"you know, case in point."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"So that like, let's say the following birthday,"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"you get me like the Lindsey Buckingham book."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I'd be like, that's so funny."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Like that's bomb."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"You know what I mean?"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"Like, it's like a little through line in our inside jokes."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"But like for me,"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"usually the people that are close to me,"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"they do definitely ask like, all right, what do you want?"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"Like, what's the deal?"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"What, just give me something."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"And like my brother, I remember not this year,"
01:02:55;01:03:00;"but last year I was like, dude, I need a dust buster."
01:03:00;01:03:04;"But like every dust buster I've ever had is crap."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"They don't work."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"After a year, somehow they lose power."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Even when you plug them, they never stay,"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"never work anymore."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Like, they're just like,"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"these things are not built to last."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"And so my brother was like, leave it with me."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"And like, he went on a tear"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"and like looked up the best dust busters"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"and blah, blah, blah."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"And like went to Queens."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"'Cause that's like where they sold the one"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"and like got me this like incredible dust buster"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"that had the best reviews."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"And that was cool."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"'Cause in that scenario, it was like, okay,"
01:03:38;01:03:43;"you really went in and try to match my standards,"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"you know, and that touched me."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"That touched me."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"He didn't just go to Home Depot or Bed Bath"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"and just got me like a Dyson."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Like I don't want a Dyson."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"In fact, my Dyson broke."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"Dyson is a scam."
01:03:56;01:03:59;"He went and read reviews and got me the best one."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"- What is the best one?"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Black and Decker?"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- Nope, nope."
01:04:02;01:04:02;"It's off brand."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Let me go find, let's see."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"- And now every time you use your dust buster,"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"which I meant you're a bit of a neat freak"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"is probably all the time."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"- You're thinking of your brother."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- Once every other day."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Yeah, exactly."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Where is it?"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Let's see."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"Oh, it's called the shark."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"It's called the shark."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"(laughing)"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"- Jesus, it's the shark."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- And it's amazing."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- Straight up looks like a hammerhead shark."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- Yeah, exactly, exactly."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"I never understood that, but yeah, that's it."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"It's the shark."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"Found it in Queens."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"- I'm probably taking away all the wrong lessons"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"from this conversation,"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"but it just flashed through my mind."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Next year, everybody gets a shark."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"(laughing)"
01:04:41;01:04:46;"Accountant, wife, cousins,"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"mailman, you're getting a shark."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"(laughing)"

01:05:58;01:06:02;"- I was in London last week doing some press"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"and playing the label, new album coming out,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"all that stuff."
01:06:06;01:06:11;"And I do feel like when you travel away from your family"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"you should bring back a little something."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Nothing massive, but I was in a cute little store"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"and they sold this set of Nairns,"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"which makes really good biscuits."
01:06:23;01:06:27;"But these were Nairns cheese biscuits"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"and it came with Marmite."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"And it said, ""Love it or hate it, you gotta try it."""
01:06:32;01:06:34;"And there was some part of me, I saw this and I was like,"
01:06:34;01:06:38;"and I do kind of like Marmite and I do like funky flavors."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"And then I got home with it."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Luckily I got a couple other things."
01:06:42;01:06:47;"I got like a nice honey and I got this like a tiny"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"little magic trick for my son."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"But with the Nairns biscuits, I just saw it,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"I was like, ""Oh, that seems fun."""
01:06:54;01:06:55;"But then when I brought it home, I realized like,"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"nobody really wants to eat this in my house."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"- Doesn't matter, just have it over tea for the next day."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"And it's funny, the inside joke is there."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Don't you guys remember like our parents,"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"like when we were kids, our parents,"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"every time they went anywhere, they brought something."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"Like it's like, it was systematic"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"and the guests would bring wine."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"It was like, I feel like with our generation,"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"I mean, I'm assuming we're all the same generation."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"- You think that's a generational thing"
01:07:22;01:07:26;"or like a French Moroccan kind of thing?"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"- No, no."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"- Really, Jake?"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"- My dad goes on a business trip to Dallas."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"He's not coming back with a-"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"- A token?"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- A little cowboy hat."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"- Really?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- But Jake, if your parents were like taking you guys"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"over to somebody else's house,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"they would always bring what a bottle of wine"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"or a sweetie?"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- Maybe, I don't know."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- Wait, hold on."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"- When you're 10 years old, you don't notice"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"whether your parents are grabbing a bottle of wine."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"I won't even go with your parents."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"When you go to a guest house, do you bring something?"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"Like if you're going, not even a guest,"
01:07:56;01:07:59;"if you're going over to Ezra's or my house"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"or someone's house you're at pretty frequently,"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"do you bring something?"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Do you and Hannah bring something?"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"- If it's a dinner, yeah."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"We'll either ask or just bring a bottle."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"A bottle of red."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"- I'm a little white."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"- But if I'm just popping over to your house,"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"for a quick swim or something, then yeah."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"A bunch of dudes."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"A dude on dude hang."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Dude on dude hang, no."
01:08:25;01:08:29;"And maybe this is a thing where my wife is from the South."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"They come with a certain, and I think like maybe,"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Dave and Sydney from Montreal,"
01:08:33;01:08:37;"she would never, ever show up to someone's house"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"without some kind of gift."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"- It's unthinkable."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"- So I don't know if it's generational"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"or if it's geographical, but it's something."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"- But our parents, yeah, but it's like, it's big."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"I don't know."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"It's like our parents, they would do it"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"like every single time there was a dinner."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"It wasn't just wine."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- No, and it's a good thing."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"And it's also, one thing that I've learned over my life"
01:08:59;01:09:03;"is I just think my parents, I just don't remember,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"we weren't doing a ton of family socializing,"
01:09:06;01:09:10;"but it's been, as I've learned in life too,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"it's also, I think there's probably a part of me"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"that's like, well, is it a bougie thing?"
01:09:14;01:09:17;"And then you realize, no, because you can bring something"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"that costs almost nothing."
01:09:19;01:09:22;"And that's true, like you said, the thought that counts"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"or the thought process that counts."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"And also, maybe it's also when I think back"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"to my weird little cheese biscuit and Marmite set,"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"it's good to have stuff like that around the house"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"because it's also like kind of fun."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"You know what?"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"- Yeah."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"- Like I'm a big fan of Miracle Berries,"
01:09:38;01:09:42;"these little things that you eat"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"and then lemons taste sweet."
01:09:44;01:09:48;"And it's also because they're actually cool,"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"but it's like a bit of a gag too."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"So I realized, you know what?"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"I like sharing these with people."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"So it's nice to have a bunch around the house"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"and it's nice to have some extra packets"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"in case you're going to somebody's house."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"It's almost like the equivalent of bringing a game over"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"just to say like, all right guys,"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"now we're all gonna eat Marmite."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"Ooh, I don't know if I like Marmite."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Oh, that's that weird English."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"You know, it's almost like you're eventizing it."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- Of course."
01:10:10;01:10:14;"I mean, even when you gave me the Rashida cereal,"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"remember that?"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- Oh, the healthy cereal?"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"- Yeah, I took that home."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"I was so happy."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"- Magic spoon."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- Yeah."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"- Yeah, there's something nice about being like,"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"you're just hanging out with some friends,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"like, all right, we all got to try this."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Let's see if we like it."
01:10:28;01:10:28;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"- It's kind of like a fun thing."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"And I guess if you're into wine,"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"even that could be like a thing."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"Let's see how this wine is."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- Of course, that's what they do."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"- Right."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"- Hey Dave, what's your take on a Gifts for Tiff?"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"- In my mind, put a load up enough cash on that thing,"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"it's the gift that keeps on giving."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"- That's your fruit drink."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"- This is a sign, Val."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"I can tell that you've got,"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"this is like, this is important for you, right?"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"You want something that's-"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"- Look, it's compact."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"It fits right in the wallet."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"It's convenient."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"And then they can just, they have free will."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"They can just spend it on whatever they want."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"You can incorporate a lot of the themes"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"that you've been speaking about."
01:11:05;01:11:05;"- You're right."
01:11:05;01:11:06;"You're right."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"- I love this store."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"I love Home Depot."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Or I know you like the second cup."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"A Canadian reference for you there."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"- Yeah, yeah, sure."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"- I know you like Starbucks."
01:11:15;01:11:15;"- Yeah."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- Here's $85."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"- Great."
01:11:18;01:11:18;"That's cool."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"If, but I would only do it,"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"do you remember like when we were kids,"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"like we'd have the one relative"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"that gives us a gift certificate"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"for a store we never go to."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"- Oh."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"- And we'd be like, and it's like,"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"it's a piece of paper."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"It's just a piece of paper."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"But that piece of paper would be so like"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"ponderous in our room."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"And we'd just be like,"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"oh, I don't know what to do with it."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"You can't throw it out"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"'cause it's worth money."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"But like, you just never want to go."
01:11:44;01:11:47;"But what you're saying, Seinfeld,"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"is like the opposite of that."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"You nail the fact that this one friend"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"loves a coffee shop,"
01:11:53;01:11:54;"even if it's a coffee shop"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"or In-N-Out Burger."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"And you're like, dude,"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"a year's worth of animal fries."
01:11:59;01:12:01;"And that's huge."
01:12:01;01:12:01;"- Yeah."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"- I have a gift certificate"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"to the art of shaving"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"that someone gave me."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"It has to be 20 years ago now."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- See what I'm saying?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"- One, two, three, I don't know, dude."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"I don't know."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"- When you're getting to like--"
01:12:13;01:12:14;"- It's a piece of paper."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"- And you're getting to a random place like that,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"then it's the opposite of thoughtful."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"Sometimes where it's like--"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- Yeah, it's thoughtless."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"- And you're right, I can't throw it out."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"- You can't throw it out."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"- Because I'm just literally burning money."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Yeah."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"- And I also don't know when I'm gonna go"
01:12:29;01:12:30;"to the art of shaving."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"- At some point, the thought crosses your mind,"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"how do I monetize this?"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"How do I take the money out of it?"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"- Or what you do is you put it"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"in a little compartment until you meet that one friend"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"who's really big into shaving,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"and you're just like, here you go, bro, take it."
01:12:45;01:12:46;"You can just lace them."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"Like you don't even have, you know."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"- And then he shows up and it's expired,"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"and now he's gonna spend $120 on the art of shaving."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"- You know, people love all these like documentaries"
01:12:57;01:13:01;"and shows about scammers, the Ann Delves, the whatever."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"- But I'm also, it makes me think,"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"there must be so many like small time scammers"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"that are almost just kind of sweet."
01:13:08;01:13:13;"Like, and now I'm picturing like a grandpa"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"who picks a random store that he doesn't think,"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"maybe he's a little ashamed that he's bad at getting gifts,"
01:13:18;01:13:22;"or he lost all his money at the track,"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"and he starts making fake gift certificates"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"for all the grandkids. - That's cool."
01:13:27;01:13:30;"- And then for years, everybody's like,"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"oh, grandpa, like, you know, I don't really like"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"go to that kind of store."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"And then somebody finally realized they were all fake."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"Because when you think about how many gift certificates"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"go unused. - Get cashed in,"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"get cashed in."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"- I can totally picture this character"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"who's making fake gift certificates and giving them,"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"and also think about it,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"especially if you're in a big family,"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"you give those out to everybody,"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"let's say only 25% of people even try them."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"It might even be less."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"So then, oh, your second cousin says,"
01:14:00;01:14:03;"you know, I tried that Chili's gift certificate."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"I actually took my wife and it didn't work."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"And you're like, how strange."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"(laughing)"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"So like, you can so easily talk your way out of it."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"Everybody else doesn't even think about it."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"I'm not suggesting this,"
01:14:20;01:14:23;"but I bet there are people who do gift certificate scams"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"just to kind of not have to worry about gift giving."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"- Yeah, if you can make a fake ID,"
01:14:27;01:14:31;"you can make a fake Blockbuster gift certificate."
01:14:31;01:14:32;"That's for sure."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"- Blockbuster. - That'd be a good one."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"Give people Blockbuster gift certificates."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"- Or yeah."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"- I mean, back in the day, I mean, you know,"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"although, yeah, that's funny you should say that."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"We're playing a show in Bend, Oregon."
01:14:46;01:14:47;"I never knew about that city,"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"but apparently there's one Blockbuster there."
01:14:49;01:14:50;"- That's the last one."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"- Oh, that's where the last one is?"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"- Yeah. - Oh, that's crazy."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"We're gonna bend to this later in the year."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"I'm gonna hit it up. - Nice."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"- I just finished a round of in-stores"
01:14:59;01:15:03;"and I couldn't get over how many DVDs there still are."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"- Yeah, they're back."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"They're back."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"They're back in a big way."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"Do you still watch DVDs in any capacity, Dave?"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"- No, I don't even have anything to watch them."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"What do you mean they're back?"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- A lot of DVDs."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"Interestingly, I'll say that my cousin"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"has gotten very into, she's a therapist,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"but she has this sort of side hustle"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"that just 'cause she loves movies,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"and VHS, where VHS have started to come back"
01:15:26;01:15:30;"and they're very, either some are very expensive,"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"like they sell for hundreds, thousands of dollars,"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"like an old VHS tape, mainly to weird collectors and stuff."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"But what she does, because this is her thing,"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"speaking of gift-giving, is she'll get people"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"all their favorite movie on VHS, right?"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"- Oh, that's cool. - So they don't have one."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"- That's cool. - So you can put up"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"or put it on your bookshelf or whatever."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"So if she knows you have a favorite movie,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"she's trolling eBay or whatever."
01:15:51;01:15:54;"And that's another one that's hitting really hard."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- Huge, that's amazing."
01:15:56;01:15:59;"Get Jake Zodiac on VHS."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"I mean, you probably have it, Jake, right?"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Probably?"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"- I actually don't, that's a gap in my collection, but."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"I'm actually, that movie came out in 2007."
01:16:07;01:16:11;"I wonder if there even is a VHS for that movie."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"- They might've still been doing it."
01:16:13;01:16:16;"By the way, I just found from the year 2000,"
01:16:16;01:16:20;"a Blockbuster gift card for $5,"
01:16:20;01:16:24;"and they're selling it for 4.95 as a collectible."
01:16:26;01:16:26;"- We should-- - You know,"
01:16:26;01:16:31;"not to make a common thread between DVDs and gifts,"
01:16:31;01:16:35;"but I kid you not, Ezra,"
01:16:35;01:16:38;"from my birthday in 2012,"
01:16:38;01:16:44;"you bought me the original,"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"the staircase on iTunes."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"- On iTunes? - And I got it on iTunes."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"- Oh, interesting."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"- The original staircase."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"This is before Netflix--"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"- That was ahead of its time."
01:16:55;01:16:58;"- Yeah, that was like this culty,"
01:16:58;01:17:02;"French doc series about the woman who died, and yeah."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"- Yep, yep."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- And you gave that to me."
01:17:04;01:17:08;"I remember getting an email from you,"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"or from iTunes, Ezra sent you a gift,"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"and it was like, you clicked it, and it downloads,"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"and it was from iTunes, and it was the staircase."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"I remember this."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"- You know, we could do that for Jake."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"We could do that with Amazon Prime."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"You can order, you can spend $19.99."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Jake, that's the gift."
01:17:25;01:17:26;"I mean, you would have that forever."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- Buy Jake a digital copy of Zodiac."
01:17:28;01:17:33;"- By the way, found the VHS copy of Zodiac, $270."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"- You guys just chip in, all chip in."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"How many of you, how many of this are you?"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"How many are you?"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"- Why is it so much money? - One, two, three."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"- Well, you're not including the lunch boys either."
01:17:42;01:17:45;"The lunch boys, once you get them chipping in."
01:17:45;01:17:50;"- Ghostbusters VHS, factory sealed, 1984, on eBay for $500."
01:17:50;01:17:54;"- I was gonna say $700."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"- $500?"
01:17:55;01:17:59;"$500 for a sealed Ghostbusters VHS."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- That makes total sense though."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"I mean, that makes sense."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Does it?"
01:18:02;01:18:06;"You're just looking at the spine of the movie on your shelf."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"- You know, you do."
01:18:07;01:18:11;"Go to a Comic-Con, if Dan Aykroyd's there or whatever,"
01:18:11;01:18:12;"get Dan Aykroyd, Sig."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"- There you go."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"- Suddenly you're doubling your value."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"- Suddenly that thing is worth (beep)"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"(laughing)"
01:18:18;01:18:19;"- No, no."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"- Oh boy, you know what I just remembered,"
01:18:21;01:18:21;"speaking of gift giving,"
01:18:21;01:18:25;"you know who has kind of a themed gift giving is Seinfeld."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Every time Seinfeld's been to my house,"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"he brought me some type of celebrity based alcohol."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"- Oh, that's right."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"- There you go, there you go."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- That's right."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"- You brought Bob Dylan's whiskey."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"- Yes."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"- Florida Georgia Lion's whiskey."
01:18:39;01:18:39;"- Yes."
01:18:39;01:18:42;"- And recently you brought Walton Goggins whiskey."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- The Walton Goggins whiskey."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"- Bob Holland."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"- Yes."
01:18:45;01:18:48;"- Wow, you're aware, I wasn't familiar with your game."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"- Yeah, that's a good one."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"That's a good theme."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"You could, and for anybody out there"
01:18:53;01:18:56;"who's looking for those kind of like a gift"
01:18:56;01:18:59;"in the what, 20 to $40 range,"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"if you know somebody who,"
01:19:01;01:19:06;"you could start this tomorrow with a friend of yours,"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"is I bring you celebrity themed whiskeys,"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"'cause there are so many."
01:19:10;01:19:11;"Metallica has one."
01:19:11;01:19:16;"- Wow, or books, like I have one friend"
01:19:16;01:19:21;"where every Christmas it's like a musician's book."
01:19:21;01:19:23;"So it's like the Rick Ross book,"
01:19:23;01:19:26;"it's a Pitbull book, the Will.I.Am book,"
01:19:26;01:19:29;"and it's hilarious and that's the thing."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"And it's like, you end up reading parts of it"
01:19:31;01:19:36;"and it's so funny, and that's in the $12 range."
01:19:36;01:19:36;"- Yeah."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"- I will say it's very enjoyable going to the store"
01:19:38;01:19:42;"and trying to determine what the funniest celebrity alcohol."
01:19:42;01:19:45;"- Yeah, that's so cool."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- We could talk about this all day."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"See this time, time crisis, Club Random just works out"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"on all your press tour, Dave."
01:19:52;01:19:55;"Is this the only one where you did a gift giving guide?"
