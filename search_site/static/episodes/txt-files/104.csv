00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"We're joined by friend of the show Kazzy David."
00:06;00:09;"And we discuss all sorts of stuff."
00:09;00:11;"My recent trip to Mexico."
00:11;00:13;"My new favorite candy."
00:13;00:18;"All this, plus a deep exploration of the BJU."
00:18;00:19;"What does that stand for?"
00:19;00:21;"Well, you're about to find out."
00:21;00:24;"This is yet another..."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Eds Ronkainen."
00:28;00:31;"This is..."
00:31;00:32;"One."
00:33;00:37;"They passed me by"
00:37;00:40;"All of those great romances"
00:40;00:42;"They were a friend"
00:42;00:44;"Robbing me"
00:44;00:47;"Of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:50;"My picture clear"
00:50;00:55;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:55;00:58;"And so I dealt to the floor"
00:58;01:01;"When a bus had to go"
01:01;01:03;"Now it's different"
01:03;01:06;"I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave that only there"
01:16;01:18;"Time Crisis back again."
01:18;01:19;"What's up, Jake?"
01:19;01:21;"Not much. How are you?"
01:21;01:24;"Pretty good."
01:24;01:26;"A little stiff out of the gate, I'm sorry."
01:26;01:28;"This is our first kind of back to normal show."
01:28;01:29;"Right."
01:29;01:32;"Time Crisis went in a real star-studded direction."
01:32;01:33;"Heavy duty."
01:33;01:36;"Was that back to back, Justin Vernon and into Huey Lewis?"
01:36;01:37;"Mm-hmm."
01:37;01:40;"That was Celeb Month."
01:40;01:41;"On TC."
01:41;01:46;"Now it's just back to the scrubs, ham and egging it."
01:46;01:48;"I've never heard that phrase before."
01:48;01:49;"Really?"
01:49;01:50;"Just to mean like back to basics?"
01:50;01:51;"Yeah, like a ham and egger."
01:51;01:53;"I think it's like a baseball player term."
01:53;01:55;"Just like a real kind of..."
01:55;01:57;"What, it's like meat and potatoes?"
01:57;01:58;"Yeah, ham and egger."
01:58;01:59;"It's the same thing?"
01:59;02:01;"Yeah."
02:01;02:04;"He's a real ham and egg type guy or is it specifically a ham and egger?"
02:04;02:05;"Am I making this up?"
02:05;02:07;"I feel like I've heard ham and egger."
02:07;02:11;"Ham and egger, a common person who might be seen eating ham and eggs."
02:11;02:12;"There you go."
02:12;02:17;"Not possessing many spectacular qualities, your average Joe."
02:17;02:19;"I'm going to sign off on that."
02:19;02:22;"I just feel like people say meat and potatoes like all the time."
02:22;02:23;"Right."
02:23;02:24;"Ham and egger."
02:24;02:26;"It doesn't roll off the tongue, really."
02:26;02:27;"Ham and egger."
02:27;02:29;"There's a guy, Dave Eggers."
02:29;02:30;"True."
02:30;02:32;"Never read any of his books, but people are into him."
02:32;02:35;"We got Kazzy David stopping by."
02:35;02:37;"But you know, once somebody's been on the show more than once,"
02:37;02:38;"they become a friend of the show."
02:38;02:39;"Right."
02:39;02:42;"But if they've only been once, they're executive platinum."
02:42;02:47;"So if Huey or Justin comes back, they actually get downgraded."
02:47;02:49;"Or upgra-- yeah, in a way."
02:49;02:52;"Lady Gaga recently tweeted fame is a prison."
02:52;02:53;"That's deep."
02:53;02:54;"There's two ways to look at it."
02:54;02:58;"This is kind of what the Vampire Weekend song Rich Man is about in a way."
02:58;03:01;"It's kind of like the higher you go, the higher your status is."
03:01;03:04;"Yeah, you're winning a higher status, but you're also losing something."
03:04;03:08;"So, you know, I bet Justin and Huey, they're pretty down to earth guys."
03:08;03:12;"If we told them, guys, right now you have a very rare status in the show."
03:12;03:14;"You're both executive platinum."
03:14;03:16;"You've only ever been on the show once."
03:16;03:18;"And they'd be like, well, what are the other levels?"
03:18;03:20;"And be like, well, you know, it's low key."
03:20;03:21;"It's like friend of the show."
03:21;03:24;"I bet those guys would be like, I want to be a friend of the show."
03:24;03:25;"I'm not a god."
03:25;03:27;"You'd rather spend more time with us."
03:27;03:28;"Yeah."
03:28;03:31;"Than maintain your executive platinum status."
03:31;03:32;"I think so."
03:32;03:34;"That's like a really human tradeoff."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:36;"What if I quit the show right now?"
03:36;03:37;"Yeah."
03:37;03:39;"What would my status be?"
03:39;03:41;"It would be former co-host."
03:41;03:42;"Well, you would have--"
03:42;03:45;"But if I keep doing the show."
03:45;03:50;"Well, first of all, all those hours you logged, out the window, non-transferable."
03:50;03:52;"That's true."
03:52;03:54;"Nowhere near 10,000."
03:54;03:55;"You're like a permanent friend."
03:55;03:57;"Oh, no, what do we call it?"
03:57;03:58;"Time crisis inner circle?"
03:58;04:00;"I feel like we've referred to it on the show."
04:00;04:01;"Core crew."
04:01;04:02;"Oh, yeah, core crew."
04:02;04:04;"You could be former core crew then."
04:04;04:05;"Yeah."
04:05;04:06;"[MUSIC - THE KING, ""I'M THE ONE""]"
04:06;04:08;"[MUSIC - THE KING, ""I'M THE ONE""]"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:46;01:06:51;"Do you see this as like a popcorn classic or like an award season contender?"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"Well, clearly there's a big rift in our culture."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"As a Time Crisis listener probably doesn't know,"
01:06:57;01:07:01;"there's been this whole thing on the internet where Martin Scorsese,"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"who directed The Irishman, among other films,"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"was asked as he was doing press what he thought of Marvel movies,"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"and he said, ""Well, they're not cinema."" He compared them to amusement parks."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"And I thought he was being somewhat diplomatic,"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"because you shouldn't really have to rack your brain to think"
01:07:15;01:07:20;"whether those movies have the same values that he has."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"He said they serve a purpose, but to him that's not what he considers to be cinema."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"You know, I--"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"They're movies, not cinema."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"He has his own--"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Is that what he was saying, sort of?"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"I think so."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Yeah, they're not high art."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"But he did say something like they don't really, like,"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"have insight into the human condition, and, you know, that just set people off."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"Did you hear about this, Kazzy?"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"Yeah, and then I heard--"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"Were you pissed when you heard him say that?"
01:07:41;01:07:45;"No, I just think that, like, anything anyone says anymore is just like,"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"""Ugh, I don't know. I can't take it."""
01:07:48;01:07:51;"He should have known better than to open his stupid mouth."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Yeah, stupid."
01:07:52;01:07:56;"And then since then, Francis Ford Coppola chimed in."
01:07:56;01:08:00;"""I agree that Marvel movies are not cinema."""
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Yeah, he said he agrees."
01:08:02;01:08:06;"So basically, this has got to be a very tough time for Italian Marvel fans."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"Your loyalties are really being tested."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"If Billy Joel comes out about Marvel, forget it."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"That's the big three of 20th-century Italian artists."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"And then I think even after that, there's even one more."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"Pedro Almodovar--what is it?"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"Almodovar? Almodovar."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Yeah."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"The great Spanish filmmaker."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"Even he came out and said he doesn't like their Marvel movies."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Said they're not sexy."
01:08:27;01:08:32;"So anyway, all these kind of old guard directors have been kind of trashing"
01:08:32;01:08:36;"the Marvelverse, which again, I don't know why anybody's surprised by that."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"These movies are very different."
01:08:38;01:08:42;"The one thing I can say is if somebody really did connect with--"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"because you know how I feel about music."
01:08:44;01:08:48;"People are going to connect with a really simple pop song sometimes,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"and if you kind of say, ""Well, that's not an art song."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"It doesn't speak to the human condition,"" and then they're just like,"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"""Well, you know what? When that song dropped, that one line spoke to me."""
01:08:56;01:08:59;"There's something true about that."
01:08:59;01:09:03;"I actually--you know I'm not a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"and as much as it's fun to kind of bash on the nerds,"
01:09:06;01:09:11;"I could actually imagine if I tried to be real Galaxy brand and sympathetic about it,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"you could imagine somebody who had a hard time in their life,"
01:09:13;01:09:20;"and they saw Avengers Endgame or Thor, Welcome to the Jungle, you know, whatever."
01:09:20;01:09:23;"Thor back to the--back on the farm."
01:09:23;01:09:27;"Thor colon, back on the farm, or whatever, and they saw it."
01:09:27;01:09:32;"And, you know, these movies do have families and friendships and life and death."
01:09:32;01:09:35;"I'm going to say something like a little maybe controversial for this conversation, but I am--"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Are you sure you want to dive in?"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"I'm a huge Marvel fan."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Oh, interesting."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Like I'm that kid."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Yeah."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"I love those movies."
01:09:43;01:09:44;"You like the whole--"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Yeah, all of them."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"--Kitten Kaboodle."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"I've seen all of them."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"What's your favorite?"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Spider-Man."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"That one seems like a little bit outside."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"With Andrew Garfield?"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Oh, really?"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Yeah."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"You're old school."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"Yeah."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"No, you're mid-school."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"I mean, I am a bit of a contrarian, but I really did like it."
01:09:59;01:10:03;"And I also didn't hate the last X-Men that everyone totally hated."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Oh, with--"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"It was like a huge embarrassment."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"With the person from Game of Thrones."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Yeah."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"But so you like Avengers Endgame?"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"How many Marvel movies have you cried in?"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"I can cry in just about anything."
01:10:13;01:10:19;"Like I cried the other day watching Uptown Girls with subtitles on in Dry Bar."
01:10:19;01:10:22;"Oh, Uptown Girls, that's part of the Billy Joel universe, right?"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Yeah."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Because that's based on his song, Uptown Girls."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is."
01:10:25;01:10:29;"But so have you seen Marvel movies that where you--"
01:10:29;01:10:33;"There was a moment that connected with you and you said, ""You're goddamn right, this is cinema."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"This sheds light on the human condition."""
01:10:35;01:10:37;"I feel the emotions of--"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"You know, I guess you got people's like brothers and fathers dying and people breaking up."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"I think it definitely speaks to the human condition."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Yeah?"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Yeah."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"I guess for me personally, because I have like really--"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"I just feel really ambitious, like I want to save the world, but I can't because I don't have powers."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"But if I did, that would be sick."
01:10:55;01:10:58;"So if we want to just go pitch the headline for this episode, we could say,"
01:10:58;01:11:03;"""Cassie David says Martin Scorsese is an old f***er who doesn't know anything about cinema."""
01:11:03;01:11:04;"I could totally agree with him."
01:11:04;01:11:09;"The problem for me is that when someone says something and then I see it everywhere and it goes viral,"
01:11:09;01:11:13;"I just inherently disagree with it because I just think it looks so stupid."
01:11:13;01:11:20;"Anything you say that is repeated a million times by the whole world and then discussed is just stupid."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"I also get to the point where you're just like having an opinion on this is lame."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Yeah."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Taking sides on this is lame."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"You know, whoever might be right or wrong."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Right."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"All of it's stupid."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Well, I mean, he had an opinion."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Is it his fault that it went viral?"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"No, it's not, but it did."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Right."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"It was one thing he said probably doing like seven hours of press."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Right."
01:11:39;01:11:43;"Which leads us to Rise and Shine."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Oh, that's right."
01:11:44;01:11:49;"So you've prepared a special report for us on Rise and Shine because I can guarantee that--"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"What's Rise and Shine?"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"I knew that Jake would have no idea about this."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"It's my favorite song."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"Jake, do you even know who Kylie Jenner is?"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"I know the name."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I know that she's part of the Kardashian--"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"So, all right, Jake, you actually know who Kylie Jenner is."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"I'm impressed."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"But do you know about Rise and Shine?"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"No."
01:12:05;01:12:06;"Well--"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Is it a song?"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"About two weeks."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"It's going to be your new favorite song."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"All right, Kazzy, break it down."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"What's Rise and Shine?"
01:12:11;01:12:18;"Rise and Shine originated in basically a vlog of Kylie Jenner showing her day, touring her office."
01:12:18;01:12:25;"And she starts with waking up her daughter, Stormi, and she opens the door and she sings ""Rise and Shine."""
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Ezra, I don't have a good voice."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Well, I saw the clip."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"But it's also very awkward because it's not like she's singing her a song."
01:12:31;01:12:35;"She's kind of like, ""Oh, and this is Stormi's room."""
01:12:35;01:12:37;"And she kind of opens it and goes, ""Rise and Shine."""
01:12:37;01:12:38;"Right?"
01:12:38;01:12:39;"Yeah, that's it."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"Wait, is there a specific song that she's singing?"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"No, no, no."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"She just says, ""Rise and Shine."""
01:12:44;01:12:49;"I just want to note, too, that Stormi is fully awake when she opens the door."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"So that thing is fake."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Oh, and by the way, Jake, do you know who Stormi's father is?"
01:12:52;01:12:53;"No."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Any guesses?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"I don't think we should guess."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"Wait, what's Stormi's last name?"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"You should never guess people's fathers."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"What is Stormi's last name?"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"I guess Scott."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Yeah."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Would it be--"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"Must be Scott."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"Not Stormi Jenner?"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"No, it's not Stormi Jenner."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"Why is that so crazy?"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"So her dad's last name was Scott."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"I have no idea."
01:13:12;01:13:13;"Travis Scott."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"Have you ever seen The Office?"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Oh, Michael Scott."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Yeah, it's Michael Scott."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Yeah, Travis Scott."
01:13:18;01:13:25;"Remember last time when Travis Scott went back to 1985 and he's the guy from Back to the Future?"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Yeah."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"We got a great letter about that, by the way."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Did you see that?"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"We did."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Oh, yeah, somebody pitched a whole plot line for it."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"It was actually very smart."
01:13:33;01:13:38;"I'm going to put that one on the back burner for a second just because--oh, you know what?"
01:13:38;01:13:42;"Stormi's last name is Webster because Travis Scott's real name is Webster."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"Ours is Billy Joel's."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Okay, so on her show--"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Stormi Joel."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Okay."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"On her show, she goes in--"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"She says ""Rise and shine"" to her kid."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"This is what she did."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Rise and shine."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"You know what?"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"Her pitch is actually good."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"I thought people were like clowning on her like she had such a bad voice."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Oh, and this is where my daughter sleeps."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Rise and shine."
01:14:08;01:14:12;"I think people were laughing too because she puts that vibrato or whatever on the shine."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"But that's the whole song."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Rise and shine."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"It's almost like she's saying it too well."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"It's not a song."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"You know, when you think about it, if she just kind of like, ""Oh, this is where Stormi lives."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Rise and shine."""
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Rise and shine."
01:14:22;01:14:27;"It's like she paused and going like, ""Rise and shine."""
01:14:27;01:14:30;"So I have so many questions about this."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"I just got around to memes."
01:14:31;01:14:34;"I just started to understand them after years and years."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"And this--"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Wait, wait, what?"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"You didn't understand like memes?"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"Sometimes it's-- I am on board with memes now."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"Let's just say that."
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Were you not before?"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"I thought you were like kind of a meme lord."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"No, I was kind of a meme lord?"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"I don't know."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"No, I was pretty--"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"What do you mean you didn't understand them?"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"I was pretty anti-meme."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"I thought they were like the death of humor and comedy."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"But you were looking at some like low quality ones?"
01:14:57;01:15:02;"I just think of like them stealing a line from something and then them getting millions of likes."
01:15:02;01:15:05;"And like whoever thought of that line is like, ""It's me."""
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Right."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"It was me who thought of the line."
01:15:07;01:15:10;"When the Fat Jewish and F*ck Jerry were getting a lot of heat, you were like, ""Good."""
01:15:10;01:15:11;"I was way before that."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Yeah, I was--"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"Even before then."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Yeah, but I was really on board with all that."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"So it sounds like you weren't seeing a lot of dank memes."
01:15:17;01:15:18;"I like memes."
01:15:18;01:15:24;"Anyways, my point is that do things like this go viral now because--"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"Like you would think that would have been public humiliation."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Like everyone talking about this ""Rise and shine."""
01:15:29;01:15:30;"Like she did something embarrassing."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"That's why we're all talking about it."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Like this is an embarrassing moment."
01:15:32;01:15:39;"Well, as people sometimes point out, it's funny to think that in another era, remember Howard Dean when he yelled?"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"Sure."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"People just kept saying, ""Ooh, that's pretty bad."""
01:15:42;01:15:44;"And then suddenly people started being like, ""This is probably going to end his campaign."""
01:15:44;01:15:48;"And then they just made it a thing because he just went, ""Rrrr!"" or whatever."
01:15:48;01:15:52;"This became the received wisdom that his campaign was ended by that."
01:15:52;01:16:01;"And you think like even though things travel faster now, just picture all like the f*ckin' jackals who'd be like working on the Howard Dean campaign if he was running in 2019."
01:16:01;01:16:07;"Who'd have all his just like Twitter posse just like picking fights and stuff and just being like--"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"It's actually kind of misogynistic that you're making fun of Howard's high yell."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"What, a man can't make a high yell?"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Interesting."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"You know Jake Tapper?"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"It's really interesting that you're saying that."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"It's like, boy, God, Jake--"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"They were just like twisted in a way."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"And then also they'd probably have some fun with it."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"That like he'd be like on Ellen like, you know--"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Doing that."
01:16:25;01:16:28;"Yeah, doing some Fortnite dance and be like, ""Yup!"""
01:16:28;01:16:29;"They were just--"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"Oh my God."
01:16:30;01:16:31;"He used to be a genius."
01:16:31;01:16:36;"Back then, he probably would have needed a media genius to be like, ""How do you spin this?"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Maybe we can get you on Letterman next week."""
01:16:38;01:16:42;"Like today, his like meme department would have been cranking out."
01:16:42;01:16:46;"There's like five people on the campaign that have meme-making brains and like--"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Yeah."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Which is almost a disease in itself."
01:16:48;01:16:52;"They'd just be like, ""Uh, yeah. If Bernie had the energy, he could get his voice that high."""
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Like, you know, I don't know."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"They'd be like--"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"I just think they'd figure out a way to make it work very quickly."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"♪ So when you see me in the streets, man ♪"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"♪ I ain't got a mimic ♪"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"♪ 'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold this real ♪"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"♪ I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, the (beep) ♪"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"♪ When that's for, the boy that set fire to the booth ♪"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"♪ And the game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth ♪"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"♪ Some say that rap's a lie but it turns out that I'm the proof ♪"

01:17:43;01:17:45;"♪ God don't ride my shoe, bang ♪"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"- So there's these moments like this and that,"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"and like Nicole Kidman clapping at the Oscars."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"There's just all these things."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"And I guess it just depends like what kind of person you are"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"but some people would define it as public humiliation."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"Like everyone like taking something so small"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"and talking about it."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"But people on Twitter, like they love it."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"So it's like their favorite thing, but is it ironic?"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"Do they love it 'cause it's like bad?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"- I don't see what's embarrassing about it."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"- Do they love it 'cause it makes them like,"
01:18:12;01:18:15;"it's relatable, like it's human for Kylie Jenner"
01:18:15;01:18:15;"to have said that."
01:18:15;01:18:19;"Like it's, there's something like some connection to it."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"I don't know."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"- So there's a situation where something has gone viral"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"but you don't understand."
01:18:24;01:18:25;"- Why?"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"- The intent of the mob."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"- And how do you choose these things?"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"Like there's so many different things."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"- Well, Brett, I agree with you."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Where I think in the past,"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"and I think we've talked about it on the show,"
01:18:33;01:18:36;"how I think in the mid 2000s,"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"there was a moment before then,"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"if people, you know, Howard Dean yipped,"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"then he was done."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"I still don't even understand what yeeted is."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"You know, yeet?"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"- Oh, yeet."
01:18:47;01:18:49;"- I just feel like that somehow that would be a part of it."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"Hey guys, not only does Howard yip, he yeets too."
01:18:52;01:18:55;"(imitates yipping)"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"I don't know, then some like distorted trap music comes in."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"But anyway, I think this is my like total generalization"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"is that back in the old guard era,"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"which lasted roughly from--"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"- 1960?"
01:19:09;01:19:12;"- No, I was gonna say from, what's like the first film,"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"the first movie, the first talkie, the jazz singer?"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Roughly from Jazz Singer to the Seinfeld finale."
01:19:17;01:19:21;"That represents the 20th century media."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"And back then, if you yipped or yeeted,"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"yeah, it would be like a public humiliation."
01:19:25;01:19:27;"And then I think in the early internet era,"
01:19:27;01:19:30;"kind of like the college humor, pre-social media internet,"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"I just felt like this new kind of sense of humor developed"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"where suddenly it became this novelty"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"for people to make fun of themselves."
01:19:37;01:19:40;"I very distinctly remember James Van Der Beek."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"'Cause there's memes of him crying as Dawson, right?"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"And it looks so overwrought."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"And Dawson already was kind of, not to me,"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"but some people consider Dawson to be a (beep) made character."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"They use all sorts of negative language like that."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Dawson was like the epitome of like,"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"even people who like Dawson's Creek"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"were kind of like, Dawson, come on."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"No Pacey."
01:20:01;01:20:05;"But so this image of him crying, it was this jokey thing."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"And even the role itself kind of was like the epitome"
01:20:07;01:20:08;"of this cornball role."
01:20:08;01:20:11;"And I feel like he started doing a lot of these things"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"where he kind of showed he had a sense of humor about it."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"He'd like turn up in like a college humor video."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"And I feel like this is the era of like celebrities"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"whose careers would have been long gone,"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"kind of like doing funny ironic things."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"And you know, Mr. Belding showing up"
01:20:24;01:20:27;"and I don't know wherever he showed up,"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"you know, from ""Saved by the Bell."""
01:20:28;01:20:29;"- Right."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"- I just feel like that was the era of that."
01:20:30;01:20:30;"- Like ""Dancing with the Stars"" kind of stuff?"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"- A little bit."
01:20:31;01:20:34;"And also just people doing like funny, I don't know,"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"like Pete and Pete have a podcast."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"I don't know, just people kind of like being like,"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"yeah, you remember me from this other thing,"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"but I can talk about it and be self-aware"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"and have fun with it."
01:20:42;01:20:45;"And now I have room, I can make videos."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"There's a platform for it."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Maybe back in the day, all you would have had"
01:20:48;01:20:52;"was be like, oh, Jay Leno invited you on for half a second."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"Now you could actually build a true career"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"out of being self-aware and a little ironic about yourself."
01:20:57;01:21:00;"So that created this kind of middle era."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Maybe there used to be some straightforward distinction"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"between like being like humiliated,"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"but then trying to put a spin on it,"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"versus now since viral fame is like,"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"it's just intrinsically like a mix of humiliation"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"plus talent or whatever."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"And I think with the Kylie Jenner,"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"I'm sure people, there's all these memes and sayings"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"or people like the devil works hard."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"Kris Jenner works harder 'cause the mom spins."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"That's their whole story."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Kim Kardashian has a sex tape."
01:21:25;01:21:28;"She feels embarrassed that this was, I don't know who did it."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"What did Ray J do it?"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"- It was Ray J."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"- Well, I mean, did he sell it or something?"
01:21:33;01:21:34;"- Oh, I don't know."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"- That used to be like a career ender,"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"like a naked picture of them to get out"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"and just be like, ooh, and they were never heard from again."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Whereas like, they're like, no,"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"let's like turn this into something."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"But then you get to this point where people are familiar"
01:21:46;01:21:46;"with that pathway."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"They're familiar with this idea that you take something"
01:21:48;01:21:51;"ostensibly bad or humiliating, and then you spin it"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"and you actually get more attention."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"So then you get into this phase,"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"which is the weird moment that we live in,"
01:21:57;01:22:01;"where you don't even know if something is an innocent,"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"awkward moment that then you capitalized on."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"It's like when you see Vines, and I guess Vines are old,"
01:22:06;01:22:09;"you see TikToks and you're just kind of like,"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"is this real or not?"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Like, are like people throwing up,"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"doing a prank on their baby or their parent?"
01:22:13;01:22:16;"And then like, you know, people create fake viral content."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"- When I saw Bird Box, like that was like a lot of,"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"like it created so many memes."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"And it was like, did you make a movie like for the memes?"
01:22:24;01:22:25;"'Cause that's smart, but it's like."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"- Oh, but also Netflix was accused."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"- Of making their own memes."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- Because Bird Box came out and what it's basically about,"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"people had to wear bandanas."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"- If you don't have bandana on your eyes, you die."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"- You know, and it's Sandra Bullock"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"and it's a big Netflix movie."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"So it's not hard to believe that a lot of people watched it"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"the first night it was out."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"But then I feel like there was some muckraking,"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"like Buzzfeed journalists or something,"
01:22:46;01:22:51;"kind of went in and looked back at some of the early viral"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"tweets about it."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"And then they looked at the accounts and they were like,"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"this doesn't seem to be a real person or something."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"'Cause understandably things people get."
01:22:59;01:23:00;"- Russian bot."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"- The real Russian bots are American."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Turns out, American bots."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"Yeah, I feel like all this obsession with Russian bots,"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"how come nobody ever talks about the fact that probably"
01:23:09;01:23:13;"like 90% of Twitter are just like fake accounts"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"that companies and just random people make."
01:23:16;01:23:16;"- Yeah."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"- But yeah, so with Kylie Jenner going,"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"rise and shine or whatever,"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"and people getting really excited about it"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"and turning it into a meme,"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"you don't even know anymore, did she do it on purpose?"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"You just don't even know what it is anymore."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"- How organic it was."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"- It used to be straightforward."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"You'd be like, this is somebody who had"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"a slightly awkward moment and then people made fun of them"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"and then they capitalized on it."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Now even that is hard to-"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"- She loved it though."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Like she's like a billionaire,"
01:23:41;01:23:44;"like has like this insane company,"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"like has all these things."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Like I've never seen something excite her more"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"than being able to trademark rise and shine"
01:23:50;01:23:53;"as quickly as possible and like make merch."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"- How did they let her trademark rise and shine?"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"- The expression?"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"- Yeah, no, she's trademarked rise and shine."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"- I feel like celebrities are always-"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"- Which has always been-"
01:24:00;01:24:03;"- Like the three word expression in the English language."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"- Rise and shine."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"- Those basic shawl hoodies with like rise and shine on it."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"- Oh, it's like a brand."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"- You know they're making like lipsticks right now"
01:24:10;01:24:14;"called rise, one called shine, one called and."
01:24:14;01:24:20;"- Turns out and is actually the big seller of the three."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"But also I felt like there are all these stories"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"over the past few years where people would get mad"
01:24:24;01:24:27;"because a celebrity was trying to trademark"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"a commonly used phrase."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Like Taylor Swift tried to trademark something"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"and everybody's like, you can't trademark that."
01:24:31;01:24:34;"And I feel like generally these trademark applications"
01:24:34;01:24:34;"are rejected."
01:24:34;01:24:36;"- But she just started a company,"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"a brand called rise and shine."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"That's not that crazy."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"- No, no, I think she trademarked the phrase rise and shine."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- Well, I don't even know what that means."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- I wish I could trademark everything I say."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- What does that even,"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"like we're saying rise and shine right now."
01:24:47;01:24:48;"- I don't have a problem with that."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"- I don't understand why."
01:24:49;01:24:49;"- I guess it would mean that if-"
01:24:49;01:24:53;"- It means that she can use that for anything she wants,"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"I think, right?"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"- I'm making an assumption here."
01:24:55;01:24:58;"If it truly made it through all the levels to be trademarked,"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"you know, Nike is trademarked, right?"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"So you and me can't go,"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"if we start selling t-shirts that say Nike on it,"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Nike will come sue us."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"So if she trademarked rise and shine,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"and I think with trademarks, it's about categories too."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"So if she trademarked it for say apparel,"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"you know, let's say we were doing a time crisis,"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"you know, pancake breakfast,"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"we're gonna sell t-shirts that say rise and shine."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"Theoretically now she could come sue us for that."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Seems unfair because rise and shine is a-"
01:25:24;01:25:25;"- Can you show them the picture?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"- That's her in the Teletubbies son."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"This is a rise and shine remix."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"♪ Rise and shine ♪"
01:25:33;01:25:37;"♪ Rise and shine ♪"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"♪ Rise and shine ♪"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"- God, this is (beep) fire."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"This is pretty good."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"- Won't this just be forgotten in like a month though?"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"It's like-"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"- Yeah, but we'll always remember."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"- So the trademarks would cover cosmetics"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"and various clothing items,"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"including jammies, socks, and underwear."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"- So are there other brands that like,"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"for instance, Hollister, that's a brand."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- Yeah."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"- It's also just a city in California."
01:25:59;01:25:59;"- Right."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- If the city of Hollister, California"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"wanted to print shirts that said Hollister."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"- Hollister has no place in this conversation."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"- I'm just trying to understand this thing"
01:26:07;01:26:11;"of like a commonly used name or expression."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"- Well, you know-"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"- That you trademark."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"- This is my guess, I'm not a trademark lawyer."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"- Get one on the horn."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- Though I have been sued."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"I have employed one before."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- Tight."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"- But my assumption is that Hollister the city"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"could probably get away with it."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"You do hear these stories where some (beep)"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"is named after, like even Nike is named after"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"a Greek god or something."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"There are these weird stories where you hear"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"about like some brand starts and it's from a place"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"and then somebody else has, you know,"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"some old company that's called like Hollister Workwear."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"And they're like, well, we've been making, you know,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"it just says Hollister in a very small thing."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"And they're just like, well, technically"
01:26:43;01:26:44;"we own the trademark now."
01:26:44;01:26:47;"You have, I have heard stories about stuff like that."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"So with something like this, if she truly,"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"I don't know, if she truly gets it"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"and she has the trademark that she's the only person"
01:26:55;01:26:58;"who she owns the idea of putting Rise and Shine on socks,"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"for instance, theoretically any clothing brand"
01:27:01;01:27:05;"should like, should be able to make Rise and Shine socks."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Right?"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"- I don't know."
01:27:07;01:27:07;"I don't understand."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"It's like, more like, like a Supreme."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"It's the same thing that someone just like took"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"an existing phrase or word and then they're like,"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"this is my brand."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"- Sure, but I feel like--"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"- It doesn't strike me as that crazy."
01:27:15;01:27:18;"- If you can't hear a certain phrase without thinking"
01:27:18;01:27:21;"of the person who like basically made it go viral,"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"like you literally can't hear something the same way again."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Like sure, have it."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"It's already yours."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- Right."
01:27:28;01:27:28;"I guess that's a different argument."
01:27:28;01:27:31;"- I'll never hear Rise and Shine the same way again."
01:27:31;01:27:36;"♪ Big boss man ♪"
01:27:36;01:27:42;"♪ Can't you hear me when I call ♪"
01:27:42;01:27:53;"♪ Big boss man ♪"
01:27:54;01:27:59;"♪ Can't you hear me when I call ♪"
01:27:59;01:28:09;"♪ You ain't so big ♪"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"♪ You just tall ♪"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"♪ That's just about all ♪"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"- One question I have about Kylie Jenner"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"being a billionaire is there really that many people"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"buying her lipstick?"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"You're basically in the demo for people"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"who should be buying Kylie cosmetics."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Do you own any?"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"- My mind is that of the demo?"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"My age?"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"I don't know."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"- No, but more than--"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"- I don't know what the demographic is."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"- What's the name of her--"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"- I would assume most of her cosmetics are sold to women."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"- Ezra wants me to seem like a Kylie stan."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"And I just want--"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"He's not gonna get away with that."
01:28:40;01:28:44;"- I would guess that, you know, women over 30,"
01:28:44;01:28:47;"they have their old guard brands."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"And that women under 30,"
01:28:48;01:28:51;"people always talk about the coveted 18 to 30 demo."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"- Right."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"- I bet Kylie cosmetics are,"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"well, probably also people under,"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"but I bet they're kind of like,"
01:28:56;01:29:00;"are Kylie girls are 18 to 30 from the Pacific Palisades?"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"- So she's a billionaire from cosmetics?"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- Love to watch ""Friends."""
01:29:03;01:29:04;"That's a Kylie girl."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"- So awful."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"- So are you?"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Do you own any of her cosmetics?"
01:29:07;01:29:11;"- No, I would say I'm morally opposed to her cosmetics."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- Morally?"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"- Yeah."
01:29:13;01:29:13;"- But you love her music?"
01:29:13;01:29:14;"(laughs)"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"- Really love her music."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"- Why are you morally opposed to her cosmetics?"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"- Well, I think all of,"
01:29:18;01:29:21;"they all have obviously like beauty brands,"
01:29:21;01:29:26;"which are just an unbelievably wasteful thing to have."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"Just constantly making more plastic in the world."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"There's so many chemicals in it"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"and girls are just putting it on their mouths"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"and like, it's going into their skin."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"And it's just like, what does it do for anyone?"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"- So you think there should be less makeup period?"
01:29:41;01:29:41;"- Less cosmetics period."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"- Yeah, 100%, 100%."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"- I'm on board with that."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"- I mean, or like make,"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"I totally would support like an organic,"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"like makeup line that's like eco-friendly and-"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"- Right."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"- Are there some?"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"- Responsible."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"- Are any of like the popular ones eco-friendly?"
01:29:55;01:29:58;"- They're not popular, but there's quite a few."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"- Like Burt's Bees?"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"- Burt's Bees, I don't think is."
01:30:01;01:30:01;"- Tom's and Maine?"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"That's just Chapstick though, right?"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"- Yeah, but I don't, I think there's stuff in it"
01:30:05;01:30:05;"that's bad."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"- What does a Kylie lipstick typically cost?"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"What's the retail on that?"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"- There's definitely lead in it."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Like-"
01:30:12;01:30:12;"- What?"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"- Going back to a Pulpirindo."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- Only extra spicy Pulpirindo."
01:30:16;01:30:19;"- It's basically Pulpirindo lipstick."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"- $30 for a lipstick?"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Oh yeah, that's a huge profit margin."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- I've tried it before and it stains your mouth"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"for like hours."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"You cannot get it off."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"- Where does it fall in?"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"Is it considered like a cheap brand"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"or is it like a luxury brand?"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Or is it something in between?"
01:30:35;01:30:39;"People often talk about how us men or us people"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"who don't wear makeup,"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"we're privileged to not have any idea"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"how much any of it costs,"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"'cause it's very expensive."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"- All right."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"- Somewhere in between?"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"- Yeah, well, okay."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"Kylie's lipstick is $30 on average."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Looking at Chanel, which is, I guess,"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"considered the high end of luxury cosmetics,"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"which would be, okay, $40."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"- So it's in the ballpark."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"- According to this CNBC article,"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"it says the popularity behind Jenner's products"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"also stem from the limited number of products"
01:31:06;01:31:09;"she makes available during each launch,"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"which almost inevitably sell out each time."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"- Oh, so she'll do like a drop."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"- So she's-"
01:31:12;01:31:16;"- She's like, she's essentially supreme for lipstick."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"- I just can't believe she became a billionaire so quickly"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"because it's such a crowded market."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"And if you told me like,"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"""Oh, Kylie Jenner, she started a successful makeup line."""
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Like, all right, cool."
01:31:26;01:31:27;"So there must be something also"
01:31:27;01:31:30;"about the direct to consumer model or something."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"- What happened was is that we have Instagram now"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"and there was a day where we all woke up"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"and everyone had lip injections."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"Or like 20 year olds were getting Botox."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"- I don't think she does."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"I'm no expert, but."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"- Oh no."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- She does?"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"- Yeah."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"(laughs)"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"This has been like a whole thing."
01:31:48;01:31:49;"- It was like the gaslighting."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"- Yeah, no, it was like, I'm so sick."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"My whole life."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- I guess it's-"
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- You couldn't tell if Ezra was being serious or not."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"- I assumed he wasn't 'cause it's so obvious."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"- People's faces change as they get older."
01:31:59;01:31:59;"- No, no, no."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"- Deal with it."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"(laughs)"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Okay, so she-"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"- So I-"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"- People believe she had lip injections."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"But a lot of people do."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"- In quotes."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"- That's not even considered very extreme these days, right?"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"- No, I would say that like most people you see on Instagram"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"seem to have lip injections."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"It's very obvious."
01:32:16;01:32:18;"- Most people you see on Instagram?"
01:32:18;01:32:21;"- Most Instagram girls seem to have lip injections."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"It was like a huge trend."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"It was like tiny sunglasses."
01:32:24;01:32:25;"- You see a little bit less of it"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"in the Grateful Dead tribute act part of Instagram."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"- I'm so out of the loop on this stuff."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"- I just think people are so, girls are so desperate"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"to like look like these people."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"So like one person does something and then it gets trendy"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"and then it's the same thing that happens with her lip stuff."
01:32:39;01:32:42;"- In so many ways, it seemed like we're living in times"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"when you would think there'd be less of that pressure"
01:32:45;01:32:46;"comparatively."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"- I think we're gonna reach a time"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"where it gets farther away from it,"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"but I don't think we're quite out of it yet"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"because all the people you see"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"that like you're supposed to look up to"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"that are, you know, wearing cool clothes"
01:32:57;01:33:01;"or in stuff look like this."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"- And there's fresh content every day."
01:33:03;01:33:03;"- Beauty privilege."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"- So it's more oppressive."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Whereas like in the nineties, you'd be like,"
01:33:06;01:33:09;"oh, you get your copy of Us Weekly once a week."
01:33:09;01:33:10;"- Right."
01:33:10;01:33:12;"- And then you maybe would watch entertainment tonight."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"But now if it's like,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I mean, I don't know what I'm talking about folks."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"- And then in the 1890s,"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"- Oh."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"- There's one pretty girl in the village."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"- Yeah."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"Everyone tries to be like her."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"- I wish I looked like her."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"- So she's selling her lipstick through the mail."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"- She."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"- That's the deal, US Postal Service."
01:33:28;01:33:31;"- She owns the means of production and distribution, right?"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- Well, not distribution."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"She needs the US Postal Service."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"- Oh no, she's FedEx, Jake."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Actually Kylie and FedEx are teaming up"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"to take down the US Postal Service."
01:33:41;01:33:45;"Kylie's a big proponent of privatizing all mail."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"- That'd be cool."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"- Her and Jeff Bezos are teaming up."
01:33:48;01:33:48;"- Oh my God."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"- If you saw that headline,"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"you wouldn't be that surprised these days, would you?"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"- No."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"- Absolutely not."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"- On a yacht together."
01:33:55;01:33:56;"- Oh yeah, of course not."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"- Still not surprised yet."
01:33:57;01:33:58;"- What would be surprising?"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"- So little would be surprising."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"- What would truly be surprising"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"and which I don't think we've seen very much of?"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"- A dead person coming back to life."
01:34:06;01:34:08;"- That would be surprising."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"- Here's what would be surprising"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"and this tends to happen less these days."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"'Cause as much as people are like,"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"you know, we're at this like real like big moment"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"of like the future of capitalism and (beep)"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"things are actually way less spicy"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"than they've been at other moments in our history."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"And I'm not trying to be like,"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"therefore everybody should chill out."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"We're still in a bad moment."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"So for instance, I was just watching the remake of Suspiria."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"- Cool."
01:34:30;01:34:34;"- Which I love the original Suspiria."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- Sure."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"- You've seen it?"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"- Yeah, Argento."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"It's a great soundtrack by Goblin."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"- Right, sure."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"- And I was always like, I'll watch that one day."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"And I liked the directors,"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"the guy made Call Me By Your Name"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"and Bigger Splash and all this stuff."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"- Right."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- Luca."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"- Guada something."
01:34:49;01:34:53;"- Luca Joel, it's an Italian guy."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"So I was interested to see the remake"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"and he really like did some weird stuff in it."
01:34:56;01:34:59;"So I can understand why it was a divisive film"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"but it has some very, some pretty iconic moments."
01:35:02;01:35:03;"Wherever the original one was like kind of"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"out in the country or in the woods or something,"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"they have like a big Chateau."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"This he set right in like Berlin, late 70s"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"with like the Bader-Meinhof gang, like blowing up,"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"urban guerrilla, European terrorism."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"And it's constantly raining and it's just vibey in 70s."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"So I love that setting."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"And so anyway, that makes me think about the 60s"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"and the 70s when there would be these kind of people,"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"they would team up with people"
01:35:28;01:35:29;"from other parts of the world,"
01:35:29;01:35:33;"but there'd be people from, you know, first world countries"
01:35:33;01:35:36;"like the US or Germany or Italy or something"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"who would straight up be like,"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"this capitalist imperial world is bull (beep)"
01:35:40;01:35:43;"we're dropping out and we're going to war with you."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"And like, think about in the US,"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"you had like the weather man,"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"you literally had people blowing up bombs."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- Right, the Patty Hearst kidnapping."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"- Yeah, and her kind of getting radicalized and stuff."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"So that's the one thing I'll say"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"that you don't see that much of."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"You see a lot of like keyboard gangsters, right?"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"You see a lot of people from privileged,"
01:35:59;01:36:02;"middle-class, upper-class, college educated backgrounds"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"who probably get on Twitter and just be like,"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"imperialism, blah, blah, blah,"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"which I'm not saying it's a bad thing,"
01:36:08;01:36:09;"you got to call that stuff out."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"But the one thing that I would be surprised to see,"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"and I'm certainly not asking for it,"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"but it's not that long ago that that type of person,"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"the person who's politically inclined that way,"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"would be like, well, what are you going to do next?"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Get a petition going, start a TikTok account"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"where you put on a Karl Marx mask."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Like what's the next, the next step would be like,"
01:36:27;01:36:28;"no, we're going to start blowing (beep) up."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"That would be surprise (beep) out of me"
01:36:30;01:36:31;"if it was kind of like--"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- Kylie Jenner and Taylor Swift."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"(laughing)"
01:36:34;01:36:35;"- Something--"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"- Armed insurrection."
01:36:37;01:36:40;"- Even if it was kind of like, well, you know,"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"you know, the, I'm trying to think of another name"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"with a K, but you know, sometimes in these families,"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"there's like the other one that you don't know."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"- Crystal."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"- Yeah, you know, Crystal Jenner?"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"Yeah, she didn't want to be on the show."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"She never was really like, liked living in LA."
01:36:53;01:36:57;"She went to Lewis and Clark, she wanted to get up to Portland"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"and then what after that, did she kind of come join"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"the family business or something?"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"No, she actually blew up in Arby's."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"(laughing)"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"You know, like--"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"- Her real name is Rob Kardashian."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"- She's an eco-terrorist."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"- It would actually be like if you heard Rob Kardashian"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"became an eco-terrorist, that's just some (beep)"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"you haven't heard about in a long time."
01:37:13;01:37:17;"Like people truly, not just vocally reject,"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"and I know this sounds like I'm asking for it."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"I'm not advocating for it, but I'm just saying,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"it wasn't that long ago where you would hear stories"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"like that, where you would just be like, oh yeah,"
01:37:24;01:37:27;"like down in Uruguay or something like, oh yeah,"
01:37:27;01:37:31;"the president of that bank was kidnapped by the son"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"of a conservative senator."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"There were stories like that."
01:37:34;01:37:38;"- Tiffany Trump torched an SUV dealership in Eugene, Oregon."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"- Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"- That would be like, wow."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"- That would be actually next level, yeah."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"- Okay, that would be surprising."
01:37:49;01:38:05;"♪ The world is my expense ♪"
01:38:05;01:38:08;"♪ The cost of my desire ♪"
01:38:08;01:38:12;"♪ Jesus blessed me with his future ♪"

01:38:31;01:38:34;"- But anyway, I just want us to clarify,"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"'cause I want people to be like, oh, you know."
01:38:36;01:38:40;"- Ezra from Vampire Weekend is advocating eco-terrorism."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"- Yeah, by Tiffany Trump."
01:38:42;01:38:45;"But I'm just saying like, that would be surprising."
01:38:45;01:38:49;"I would think for all the polarization of this moment,"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"we still don't have something that was not that uncommon"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"in the '60s and '70s,"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"including in places like Europe and America."
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Obviously, there's like a stereotype in that era,"
01:38:58;01:39:01;"partially because of what the US and Europe"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"did to these places."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"You would hear more of these like stories"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"coming out of the Middle East or South America,"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"for instance, about like armed insurrection"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"and like true class warfare, things like that."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"But it happened in the US too."
01:39:12;01:39:14;"So that would be surprising."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"- Rob Kardashian blew up in Arby's."
01:39:16;01:39:19;"- But in terms of like corporate CEOs,"
01:39:19;01:39:22;"internet entrepreneurs and leaders in politics"
01:39:22;01:39:25;"doing idiotic stuff, very little is gonna surprise us."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"- And even just like the strange bedfellows aspect of it."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"- Yeah, nothing is surprising."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"- Oh, Jeff Bezos and Kylie Jenner"
01:39:31;01:39:35;"like partnering on a new transportation delivery service"
01:39:35;01:39:38;"that's gonna put 50,000 truck drivers out of work."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"Be like, uh-huh. - Uh-huh."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"What's the next story?"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"- Yeah, that seems like mutually beneficial."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"And you're like, Rob Kardashian blew up in Arby's."
01:39:45;01:39:48;"Whoa. (laughing)"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"Actually, because Arby's,"
01:39:51;01:39:54;"they made their whole thing be about meat, right?"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"Didn't we talk about this?"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"- We have the meats."
01:39:56;01:39:57;"- We have the meats."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"That would actually fall pretty squarely"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"under like eco-terrorism."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"- Yeah, like vegan activism."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"- Vegan activism, that's just like--"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"- Pita kind of stuff too."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"- Rob Kardashian, Tiffany Trump,"
01:40:06;01:40:09;"and then just like some straight up like Eugene, Oregon"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"activists are just like sitting around just being like,"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"let's target McDonald's."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"They're the biggest, blah, blah, blah."
01:40:14;01:40:19;"And then somebody's like, no, Arby's, they've got the meats."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Rob's like, I'll do it. (laughing)"
01:40:21;01:40:22;"- And then Wendy's gets on Twitter"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"and they're just like, come at me."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"- That's where even the surprise part"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"would cease to be surprising."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"It's like, you're like, holy (beep)"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Rob Kardashian became a vegan eco-terrorist"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"and he blew up in Arby's to make this like larger point"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"about factory farming and meat consumption"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"and blah, blah, blah."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"And then be like, this is some (beep) that surprised me."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"And then the next day, yeah, when is it?"
01:40:41;01:40:42;"- Five minutes later."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"- Wendy's just like, Arby's a bunch of (beep)"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"got blown up."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Don't even try to blow up one of our spots."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"And then just like Donald Trump Jr."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"just like retweets and he's just like this."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"- Wendy's and Donald Trump Jr. clap back"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"at Rob Kardashian's eco-terrorism."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"- Like, honestly, I wasn't a fan of Wendy's before,"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"but seriously, don't come to me with that vegan bull (beep)."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"You know, I've said this many times on the show."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"I'm very vegan sympathetic."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"And I think if the worst thing you could say about vegans"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"is they talk about it a lot, that's the joke,"
01:41:11;01:41:12;"is that they always talk about it."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"Being the type of person who always talks about"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"hating vegans, it's just like-"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- That's even weaker."
01:41:18;01:41:18;"- That's Trump Jr. (beep)"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"- It's kind of like saying,"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"I really hate when someone's like, no, I love Obama."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"It's like, yeah, we all do."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Obviously, you love Obama."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"Or like, I love what's a really popular-"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"- Billy Joel."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"- I love Billy Joel. - The music of Billy Joel."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"- No, I love Billy Joel."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"It's like, yeah, okay, great."
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Like, vegans are stupid."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"It's the same, don't say something we all know"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"and agree upon."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"(all laughing)"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- So you're saying-"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- Don't speak."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"- Vegans are stupid, but-"
01:41:47;01:41:47;"- It's just like play it out."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Like, yeah, we know."
01:41:49;01:41:52;"- Well, yeah, like if the idea is the type of person"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"who's very pleased with themselves"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"and goes on and on about how much better they are"
01:41:56;01:42:00;"than another person, that if the idea is like,"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"I find that type of person tiresome."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"It's like, yeah, no (beep)."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Anybody would be annoyed by a person who comes"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"and like constantly brags in front of them."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"And you know what else?"
01:42:10;01:42:13;"You gotta salute all those quiet vegans out there,"
01:42:13;01:42:14;"which is most of them."
01:42:14;01:42:14;"- Most vegans I know."
01:42:14;01:42:18;"- If you say you're a quiet vegan, are you a quiet vegan?"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"- I identify as a quiet vegan."
01:42:19;01:42:20;"- Are you a quiet vegan?"
01:42:20;01:42:22;"- I'm actually a freegan."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"- Are you doing dumpster diving with Rob Kardashian"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"(all laughing)"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"up in Oregon?"
01:42:27;01:42:30;"Okay, sorry, what does it mean that you're a freegan?"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"- It means that if I'm at a restaurant or something,"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"I will not like, or a grocery store myself,"
01:42:35;01:42:39;"I will not order or buy meat."
01:42:39;01:42:42;"If I'm at like a dinner party that has meat"
01:42:42;01:42:45;"and they're not gonna like get more because of me,"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"I'll have some."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"So I don't actually influence like how much meat."
01:42:50;01:42:50;"- Right."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"- Okay, but let's say I'm call you up,"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"I invite you to dinner party,"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"say, hey, I'm about to go do the shopping."
01:42:56;01:42:58;"I know we got 10 people coming."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"I'm making my famous ribs as the main thing,"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"but I'm also gonna provide vegan options."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"So are you gonna eat ribs?"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"- No, I'm not."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- So I called you ahead of time,"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"you say absolutely not, I'm not gonna eat ribs."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"- Yeah, and you're gonna buy less ribs"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"because I told you I wasn't gonna have any."
01:43:12;01:43:14;"- I got the phone lodged between my,"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"doing that thing where it's like between my ear"
01:43:15;01:43:16;"and I'm like holding two things of ribs."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"- You like have to pee."
01:43:17;01:43:21;"- And it's like between my shoulder and my ear."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"And I was like, yeah, all right, so you're out for ribs."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"Okay, I respect that."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"So you're basically vegan."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"- Not really, but yeah."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"- If last minute you came over to somebody's house"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"and they made their famous ribs."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"- And they were like, we have so many leftover ribs."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"And I was like really hungry."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Like we don't know what to do with these."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Like we have leftover ribs, do you want them?"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"And I would say, yeah, and I would have one."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"- You just go in on those ribs."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"- Yeah, be like I haven't had ribs in five months."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"There's been no leftovers."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"- When was the last time you had ribs?"
01:43:48;01:43:51;"- I don't really eat ribs to be honest."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"It's not something like I crave."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"- Really, because I think if I was freegan,"
01:43:55;01:43:56;"I would still end up eating a lot of ribs"
01:43:56;01:43:59;"just because I'm often in ribbist."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"- Rib environments."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"- Ribbed environments."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"- Rib country."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"- I'm often in ribbed country."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Rib universe."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"- I just know so many like rib type people"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"that I bet when I look back and be like,"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"how did this six months of freegan go?"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"I'm like, how did I eat ribs every day?"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"My friends are just too generous."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"- Beef, what a relief."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"When will this poisonous product cease?"
01:44:20;01:44:23;"This is another public service announcement."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"You can believe it or you can doubt it."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Let us begin now with the cow."
01:44:27;01:44:30;"The way it gets to your plate and how."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"The cow doesn't grow fast enough for man."
01:44:32;01:44:35;"So through his greed, he makes a faster plan."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"Through the stress, the cow gets sicker."
01:44:40;01:44:44;"21 different drugs are pumped into the cow in one big lump."
01:44:44;01:44:48;"So just before it dies, it cries in the slaughterhouse"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"full of germs and flies."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Off with the head."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"They pack it, drain it, and cart it."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"And there it is in your local supermarket."
01:44:54;01:44:57;"Red and bloody, a corpse neatly packed."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"And you wonder about heart attacks?"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Come on now, man, let's be for real."
01:45:01;01:45:04;"You are what you eat is the way I'm feel."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"But the Food and Drug Administration"
01:45:06;01:45:09;"will tell you meat is the perfect combination."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"See, cows live under fear and stress,"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"trying to think what's going to happen next."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Fear and stress can become a part of you."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"In your cells and blood, this is true."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"So when the cow is killed, believe it,"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"you preserve those cells."
01:45:22;01:45:26;"You freeze it, thaw it out with the blood, and season it."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Then you sit down and begin eating it."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"In your body, its structure becomes your structure."
01:45:31;01:45:33;"All the fear and stress of another."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Any drug is addictive by any name."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"Even drugs in meat, they are the same."
01:45:38;01:45:42;"The FDA has America strung out on drugs and beef, no doubt."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crap,"
01:45:45;01:45:48;"tell yourself you're going to try and stop eating meat."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"And you'll see you can't compete."
01:45:50;01:45:53;"It's the number one drug on the street, not crack."
01:45:53;01:45:56;"Because that was made for just black, but ground beef"
01:45:56;01:45:57;"for all American teeth."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Life brings life."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Death brings death."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"Keep on eating the dead and what's left."
01:46:02;01:46:05;"Absolute disease and negative."
01:46:05;01:46:08;"Read the book, How to Eat to Live, by Elijah Muhammad."
01:46:08;01:46:12;"It's a brown paperback for anybody, either white or black."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"See how many cows must be pumped up fatter?"
01:46:14;01:46:17;"How many rats gotta fall in the batter?"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"How many chickens that each dish you eat?"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet?"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"See, you'll consume."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"The FDA can care less."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's fresh."
01:46:26;01:46:29;"For $19.90, you suckers."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"Okay, so what's the longest being a freegan"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"that you end up going without meat?"
01:46:34;01:46:37;"- It depends like how social I'm being, I'd say also."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I've gone a few months without having meat."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- A few months is serious."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"That's a very effective way to approach it."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"That seems like a good thing to do."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"I should probably do that."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"If you go to a restaurant and there are vegetarian options,"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"but it's not really a meal,"
01:46:49;01:46:53;"like, so you call up some of your girls and you're like,"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"all right, what's the move for tonight?"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"We're going to the ribs place."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"And then you roll up to the ribs place and you're like,"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"all right, obviously I'm freegan."
01:47:02;01:47:02;"I'm not going to order ribs."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"But then you start looking through the menu and you're like,"
01:47:04;01:47:07;"well, I guess the only thing that I could cobble together"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"would be like a side of mac and cheese"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"and a piece of cornbread."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Are you just going to be like, do that?"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"- Well, mac and cheese has dairy in it."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"So it's not freegan."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- Okay, so literally it's only cornbread."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"And that might even have eggs in it or something."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"- Probably."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"- So your girls are just,"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"their faces just dripping in barbecue sauce."
01:47:27;01:47:32;"Just mounds of ribs on the table,"
01:47:32;01:47:33;"but you would just still be like."
01:47:33;01:47:35;"- To be honest, if we were going to a rib restaurant,"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"I would probably eat before I went there."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"- Oh, for sure. - Easy."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"- Yeah."
01:47:40;01:47:42;"It's not funny, it's just true."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"- I haven't considered the possibility."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"- Cassie, what do you think about the idea"
01:47:45;01:47:49;"of popcorn and raisins, like as a snack?"
01:47:49;01:47:52;"- Like how people eat popcorn and M&M's, but with raisins?"
01:47:52;01:47:52;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"I don't think I've ever asked you this before."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"- No, you haven't."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"- Does it sound appetizing to you?"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"- No, no, it doesn't."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"- Sounds terrible."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"- It sounds like it would create"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"a weird texture in your mouth."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"- Okay."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"- Oh yeah, the texture."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"- I don't even know what the raisin flavor"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"is bringing to the popcorn."
01:48:08;01:48:09;"- We don't have to dwell on this."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"- No, we gotta keep talking about it."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"- And it's not even vegan."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"- It's not even vegan."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"- Because is it not vegan?"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- Yeah, 'cause you used buttered popcorn."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"- What if it's unbuttered?"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"What if it's just dry, unflavored popcorn?"
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- I don't like raisins."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"- Well, that's not what you did."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"That's not what you did with your first batch."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"- Okay, we can change the subject back to."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"When did you create this?"
01:48:27;01:48:30;"- It's been something that I've been sort of"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"chipping away at for a little while now."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"- Chipping away like?"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"- I'm trying to generate some VC money for,"
01:48:35;01:48:38;"'cause I've just noticed that no one's ever"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"really combined those two snacks before."
01:48:40;01:48:43;"- No, but they are two snacks separately"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"that have been combined with a lot of different things."
01:48:45;01:48:48;"- That's right, so why not bring them together individually?"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"- Because it's stupid."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"- Okay, you know, that's not really the answer"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"that I was hoping that this was something"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"that we could work on together."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- It could be your Kylie Cosmetics."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"- What are you calling it?"
01:48:57;01:48:58;"- Popcorn and raisins."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"- Like Rise and Shine."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"Ezra, have you tried the popcorn and raisins?"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"- No, I would never, 'cause I barely like raisins"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"to begin with."
01:49:05;01:49:05;"- Okay, no."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"- And it's gonna."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"- They're not popular."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- Raisins suck."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"- Okay."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"- That'd be a sweet t-shirt though."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"- Raisins suck."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"- Oh no."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"- No, raisins suck."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"- Okay, both are part of the t-shirt line."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"- You're gonna trademark it?"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"- One is just popcorn and raisins."
01:49:19;01:49:19;"(laughing)"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"- Just that?"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"- That's what the shirt says."
01:49:23;01:49:23;"- Okay."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"- Like sort of in that college font."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"- Right, Seinfeld, I'll give you the green light"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"to make some popcorn and raisins."
01:49:28;01:49:32;"- Trademark the popcorn and raisins as our brand."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"- Popcorn and raisins."
01:49:34;01:49:38;"Popcorn and raisins."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"- I just like that something positive"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"has come out of this, so yeah."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"- It's such a bad."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"- The merch is better than the song."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- No, you know what, this is just like"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"what we were talking about."
01:49:45;01:49:48;"A terrible, humiliating thing happened"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"that you pitched this dog (beep) idea."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- Hey, wait."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"- And then the rest of the team"
01:49:53;01:49:58;"took that turd and polished it into something useful."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- You know what, on Twitter,"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"some of our followers think it's a cool idea."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"You know."
01:50:05;01:50:05;"- And this is--"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"- Are you allowed to tweet about this?"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"- I've tweeted about it."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"I've floated it out there from time to time."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"- And this is the office kitchen--"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"- Multiple times."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"- Where my employees can come get their snacks."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"Popcorn and raisins."
01:50:20;01:50:20;"- All right."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"- Popcorn and raisins also just sounds like"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"something that Donald Trump Jr. would make fun of"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"on Twitter, just like,"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"""Oh yeah, Bernie Sanders wants you eating"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"""popcorn and raisins."""
01:50:32;01:50:33;"- Three meals a day."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"- You can come get my ribs"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"when you pry them from my cold, dead hands."
01:50:38;01:50:39;"Popcorn and raisins does kind of seem like"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"the future liberals want."
01:50:41;01:50:46;"- It's sustainable, it's healthy."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"- 2020 popcorn and raisins."
01:50:48;01:50:48;"- There you go."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"- The future liberals want."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"- Would that be a cool band name or not?"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"I can't decide."
01:50:52;01:50:52;"- Popcorn and raisins?"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"- Yeah."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Oh, hell no."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"- It's more of an album title, really."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"- Yeah, like a blues traveler album title."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"- It's really nothing."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"- Popcorn and raisins."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"Came out on Sire Records in '93."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"- Or like a Ween album."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"- Oh, for sure."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"- Yeah, 'cause they got chocolate and cheese."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"- Right, pure guava."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"- Popcorn and raisins."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"- What's that Gandhi quote?"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"First they laugh at you and then they,"
01:51:13;01:51:14;"whatever, then you win."
01:51:14;01:51:17;"- I feel like Gandhi invented the internet."
01:51:17;01:51:18;"- Basically."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"- I just feel like we're in the laugh at you phase"
01:51:20;01:51:25;"of popcorn and raisins, but you know how the quote goes."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"- I'll never be able to picture you again"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"without thinking of popcorn and raisins."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"- Okay."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"- Yeah, Seinfeld, I think you should really"
01:51:31;01:51:32;"think this through."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"You've gotten bets so big on this idea"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"that now when people look at you,"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"they literally just see popcorn and raisins."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"- It's your aesthetic."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"(laughing)"
01:51:42;01:51:43;"- You gotta really think about this."
01:51:43;01:51:46;"- It's overshadowed everything you've ever done on Seinfeld."
01:51:46;01:51:47;"- You know, I just brought this up to you"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"45 seconds ago, Kazzy."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"I wouldn't say it's overshadowed everything at this point."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"- Popcorn raisins could be a Seinfeld episode."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"- It sounds like George's idea."
01:51:56;01:51:58;"- Yeah, it's a George idea."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"- Or a Kramer."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"- Yeah, it's a Kramer idea for sure."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"- You know what just occurred to me?"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"When I go, this is gonna make me unpopular, I think."
01:52:05;01:52:08;"When I do go to the movies,"
01:52:08;01:52:12;"I do get popcorn and raisinets,"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"and they go very well together."
01:52:13;01:52:16;"- Oh, but then we're introducing the chocolate."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"- I understand, but we're getting closer."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"- Yeah."
01:52:20;01:52:23;"- I like mixing chocolate candy in with popcorn."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"- Yeah, that's better."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"- What I've just heard is all of you admit"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"that you do like popcorn and raisins,"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"just with a little chocolate in there."
01:52:30;01:52:30;"It's really--"
01:52:30;01:52:33;"- Popcorn and raisins, raisins, pop."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Wait, have we made that joke before?"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"It was like a kind of like '90s DJ assault type,"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"like ass and (beep) type remix."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"Popcorn and raisins, raisin, popcorn and raisin,"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"raisin, popcorn and pop."
01:52:45;01:52:48;"- I mean, I like how we're all warming up to this idea,"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"and I love it."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"- In lieu of the top five,"
01:52:50;01:52:54;"we essentially just did top five best popcorn raisins idea."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"We're doing the collegiate shirt."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"By the way, that's the new Vampire Weekend classic"
01:52:57;01:52:58;"is our collegiate sweatshirt."
01:52:58;01:52:59;"- Hmm, oh, cool."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"- That's been a big seller on the road."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"Actually, you should take the Vampire Weekend college shirt,"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"and let's do a limited run of that exact same shirt,"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"but I would say popcorn and raisins."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"- Are you serious?"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"You're like Shiv Roy right now."
01:53:12;01:53:12;"- Yeah, and we'll let you--"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"- Is this real?"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"(beep)"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"(laughing)"
01:53:15;01:53:16;"- And we'll give,"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"I feel like we give away too much free stuff on this show."
01:53:19;01:53:19;"- We do."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"- We need to start giving back."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"I know that we got some wealthy listeners."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"There's some TC heads with some fat pockets."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"- Oh, yeah."
01:53:26;01:53:30;"- So I think let's make whatever, 10, 20."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Let's do a popcorn and raisins remix"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"of the Vampire Weekend college sweatshirt,"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"and this time we're selling it for profit,"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"and we're gonna give the money to the vegans."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"- To Netflix."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"- To the vegans."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"To Netflix."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"Let's give it to the vegans."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"- Wait, the vegan charity?"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Like save the vegans?"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"What are--"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"- I mean, we could give it to like an eco-terrorist."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"- Vegan awareness."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"- We could give it to an eco-terrorist group,"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"although that could land us in jail or something."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"If we straight up gave it to an eco-terrorist group,"
01:53:55;01:53:56;"that's probably illegal."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"- There are vegan charity, actually there are."
01:53:58;01:54:02;"There's Chili's on Wheels, Food Not Bombs."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"- That sounds tight."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"- Yeah, I like that one."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"- Or just something ecological."
01:54:05;01:54:08;"Something eco-friendly, something that promotes veganism."
01:54:08;01:54:11;"Although I would also say we could do a Robin Hood thing."
01:54:11;01:54:15;"We get some of our bacon-loving, fat-pocketed TC heads,"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"buy the sweatshirt, and all profits,"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"we pay directly to vegans."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- Yeah, okay."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- Remember once on Time Crest, we talked,"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"we wondered out loud if there were any vegan spice heads,"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"because it seems to be that people"
01:54:27;01:54:30;"who are really into spicy food are also into meat."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"And I remember we got an email from somebody who said,"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"""Hey, just so you know, I'm a vegan spice head."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"""I'm vegan, but I love spicy food,"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"""and I still get my spicy kicks,"
01:54:37;01:54:40;"""despite the fact that I don't eat wangs,"""
01:54:40;01:54:41;"or anything like that."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"So let's start with that person,"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"and ask them if they know any broke vegans,"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"and then we're gonna fully Robin Hood this."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- I like this a lot."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"I like this a lot."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"- Do you think at a Vampire Weekend show,"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"at the merch booth, if there was just a shirt"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"that just said ""popcorn and raisins,"""
01:54:56;01:54:57;"(laughing)"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"would people buy it?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"- What are you talking about, mixed in?"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"- No, just--"
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- I think there could be--"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- It doesn't say Vampire Weekend on it."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"It just says-- - It just says"
01:55:04;01:55:05;"""popcorn and raisins."""
01:55:05;01:55:08;"- I think deep, deep TC heads would buy it."
01:55:08;01:55:09;"- Yeah, I think-- - It'd be a slow burn."
01:55:09;01:55:10;"- I think there could be,"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"I could imagine a big Vampire Weekend show,"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"maybe five to 10 TC heads might be there,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"and maybe would buy it."
01:55:17;01:55:17;"- Like no one would be like,"
01:55:17;01:55:20;"""Oh, that's sick, I'm gonna buy it."""
01:55:20;01:55:20;"- No, because-- - I would say"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"it'd have to be a TC head."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"- No, because-- - I'm gonna get"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"the popcorn and raisins one."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"- And also because the idea is so bad,"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"and so disgusting that people,"
01:55:26;01:55:29;"actually, it would probably have a negative impact"
01:55:29;01:55:30;"on the sales of everything,"
01:55:30;01:55:31;"'cause people would just be browsing,"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"and then see popcorn and raisins,"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"just feel a little sick,"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"and be like, ""Ah, I'm gonna go get a--"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"- Does it have the VW snake?"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"- The sweatshirt? - The sweatshirt, yeah."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- No, no, the sweatshirt-- - Popcorn and raisins"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"and snakes. - The sweatshirt."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"- For the Vampire Weekend Collegiate sweatshirt,"
01:55:42;01:55:43;"which is a new classic,"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"I think we're gonna be making this for years to come."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"- Wow, a standard. - A standard."
01:55:47;01:55:50;"You can look up, we sell a gray one on the website,"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"and maybe we'll start slowly doing other colors."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"- You don't wanna taint this aesthetic"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"with popcorn and raisins."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"- Well, we're gonna make like 10."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"- Well, like Tessie."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"- It's real classy."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"- It would be blue."
01:55:59;01:56:02;"- I gotta say, this is the hottest merch item"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"we've had in years."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"It's showing up all over the place,"
01:56:05;01:56:06;"people are loving it,"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"people are saying this is our best merch item ever."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"- Very Trump."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"- So we made, (laughs)"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"so we made like a fake kinda logo"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"that says the kids don't stand a chance."
01:56:15;01:56:16;"Look, yeah, you're right,"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"I don't exactly wanna taint it too much"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"with popcorn and raisins,"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"but maybe we make 10 to 15."
01:56:21;01:56:21;"I just like this."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"- Make it a drop."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"- I like, we're doing a drop,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"and I like the idea that we give the money straight"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"to broke vegans."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"- I think you're gonna be amazed at how quickly--"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"- I think they're gonna sell."
01:56:30;01:56:33;"I think from the freezer's gonna hop on this immediately,"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"or someone from that community."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"- Well, they can help us,"
01:56:37;01:56:38;"'cause they have a direct line"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"to Vampire Weekend merch fans."
01:56:41;01:56:44;"- Would this be available on vampireweekend.com,"
01:56:44;01:56:45;"or is this some sort of rogue thing?"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"- This is more of a time crisis thing."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"- All right, fair."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"Trying to determine the parameters here."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"Okay."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- I like the idea,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"and you know, 'cause say we give this to some big charity,"
01:56:54;01:56:55;"like for all we know,"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"they're spending it on a gala."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"I want this money to go directly to broke vegans,"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"so we need two things."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"- I don't know how we quantify that."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"I don't know how we track that."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"- Well, okay, that's what we're gonna do with small."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"Just straight up."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"If you're a TC head,"
01:57:08;01:57:09;"- You're a vegan."
01:57:09;01:57:12;"- And you're a relatively broke vegan,"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"and guys, come on."
01:57:13;01:57:16;"We come on this show, we keep it real."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"We bare our souls."
01:57:17;01:57:20;"You know, we don't hide behind the bull (beep)"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"and we expect the same from you."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"- Mask off."
01:57:22;01:57:25;"- If I find out that a rich vegan hit us up,"
01:57:25;01:57:26;"I'm gonna be irate."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"This is for somebody who can't even afford Apple Music."
01:57:29;01:57:32;"They listen to the live stream on somebody else's phone."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"For every t-shirt sold,"
01:57:33;01:57:36;"the profit margin that came from the bacon eating fat cat"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"goes straight to a broke vegan."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"- One broke vegan."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"- Yeah, so maybe 10 shirts, 10 broke vegans."
01:57:41;01:57:42;"- Oh, I see."
01:57:42;01:57:45;"One to one ratio broke vegan to popcorn raisin shirt."
01:57:45;01:57:47;"- Somebody whose day would actually be brightened"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"by being like 40 bucks."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"And you know what's the best part?"
01:57:50;01:57:53;"When we send that 40 bucks to that person,"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"we know they're not gonna use it to buy ribs"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"that's killing our environment."
01:57:57;01:57:58;"- Yeah, and you know what's great about this too"
01:57:58;01:58:01;"is we can include a sample of actual popcorn and raisins"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"so that we can sort of spread the gospel that way as well."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"- No, that's gonna get us in trouble."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"- There's some real contempt on Kazzy's face right now"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"over this whole--"
01:58:10;01:58:11;"- I have to go."
01:58:11;01:58:12;"(laughing)"
01:58:12;01:58:13;"- Well, anyway, I have a feeling"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"there's somebody listening right now who says,"
01:58:15;01:58:19;"you know what, I'm vegan and 40 bucks would actually,"
01:58:19;01:58:19;"that'd be great."
01:58:19;01:58:21;"So, you know, if you're that person,"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"you hit up the Time Crisis email,"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"just so that we have you on deck and we'll make this happen."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"- Deal."
01:58:27;01:58:28;"- All right, we'll see you next time."
01:58:28;01:58:29;"Thanks Kazzy for coming through."
01:58:29;01:58:33;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
