02:18;02:19;"A name you can trust."
02:19;02:22;"Spent a couple hundred more than I would have elsewhere."
02:22;02:23;"Right."

02:32;02:33;"But it says something on the inside?"
02:33;02:35;"Yeah, Tiffany Co."
02:35;02:40;"So I'm just wearing this brand adjacent to my skin at all times."
02:40;02:45;"So now if we did like one of those magazine like break down the look for you, Jake, it'd"
02:45;02:51;"be like homemade Grateful Dead t-shirt, pair of Lee jeans, New Balances."
02:51;02:52;"Gray polar fleece."
02:52;02:54;"A gray polar fleece."
02:54;02:55;"North face."
02:55;02:59;"A North face polar fleece and a Tiffany's gold ring."
02:59;03:00;"And an old minivan."
03:01;03:02;"Yeah."
03:02;03:03;"I love it."
03:03;03:10;"I love it."
03:17;03:26;"I love it."
03:26;03:41;"I love it."
03:56;04:16;"I love it."
04:16;04:44;"I love it."
05:12;05:24;"So we're listening to Bob Dylan, Man and Me."
05:24;05:30;"Right, because this is from your wedding playlist, which is we now have up on Apple Music, Jake's"
05:30;05:31;"wedding playlist."
05:31;05:34;"Literally, you put up the playlist that you made for your own wedding."
05:34;05:39;"Yep, my iPhone was plugged into the PA system, the entire wedding."
05:39;05:41;"Just, you know, playing for a few hours."
05:41;05:43;"So you didn't hire a DJ."
05:43;05:44;"Nope, golden oldies."
05:44;05:45;"Tasteful palette."
05:45;05:50;"This may be Bob's sweetest song."
05:50;05:51;"It's a great song."
05:51;05:53;"This actually is the epitome of tasteful palette."
05:53;05:54;"Oh yeah."
05:54;05:55;"And also it's in the Big Lebowski."
05:55;05:57;"Yeah, I mean, also that association."
05:57;05:59;"Favorite movies of all time."
05:59;06:00;"You had a small wedding."
06:00;06:01;"Was there dancing or was it more just like-"
06:01;06:02;"Yeah, a little bit."
06:02;06:03;"A little dancing."
06:03;06:04;"So yeah, it was a small wedding with 20 people."
06:04;06:09;"It was a few friends and then parents and aunts and uncles."
06:09;06:12;"So it wasn't like a raging dance floor, but we did a first dance."
06:12;06:13;"Yeah, what was the first dance?"
06:13;06:15;"The first song on the playlist, the Elvis song."
06:15;06:16;"The Wonder of You."
06:16;06:17;"Yep."
06:17;06:19;"Sort of like late Elvis."
06:19;06:22;"This is like Vegas Elvis?"
06:22;06:23;"Yep."
06:23;06:27;"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the floor."
06:27;06:29;"Mr. and Mrs. Jake Longstrip."
06:29;06:33;"You got it."
06:33;06:39;"I love this palette too, man."
06:39;06:40;"Dana's mom loved this choice."
06:40;06:43;"Everyone else was like, ""Come on, man."
06:43;06:44;"That was corny."""
06:44;06:46;"Dave was just like, ""Mm."""
06:46;06:47;"Yeah."
06:47;06:48;"Not tasteful."
06:48;06:49;"He was like, ""Late Elvis, huh?"
06:49;06:50;"Okay."""
06:50;06:54;"And you dance for the whole- And then everybody joins you?"
06:54;06:55;"Yeah, yeah."
06:55;06:56;"We dance for the entire song."
06:56;06:57;"This is- Yeah."
06:57;06:58;"But here's the thing."
06:58;07:00;"This has a great James Burton guitar solo in it."
07:00;07:02;"It's two minutes, 15 seconds."
07:02;07:03;"So it's like- Nice and short."
07:03;07:04;"In and out."
07:04;07:07;"The Wonder of You."
07:07;07:10;"But it's also kind of up-tempo slightly."
07:10;07:15;"So it's not like a painfully slow, plodding dance."
07:15;07:19;"And then after that, we went into some other kind of up-tempo oldies."
07:19;07:22;"And then the old folks got out on the floor and danced for a little bit."
07:22;07:25;"The dancing was like 30 minutes."
07:25;07:26;"Went over at 9.30."
07:26;07:27;"Great."
07:27;07:30;"So mostly just conversation, cracking a cold one."
07:30;07:31;"That was more the vibe?"
07:31;07:32;"Yeah, it was great."
07:32;07:33;"Great food."
07:33;07:37;"We went to the wilderness yacht club, which is a beautiful old boathouse that juts out"
07:37;07:38;"into Tomales Bay."
07:38;07:39;"In Northern California."
07:39;07:40;"Yeah."
07:40;07:41;"Great weather."
07:41;07:43;"It was like 70, light breeze, sunny."
07:43;07:44;"Nice."
07:44;07:45;"Beautiful."
07:45;07:46;"We came in in a boat."
07:46;07:49;"Because you got actually married on a dock."
07:49;07:50;"Yep."
07:50;07:51;"Yeah."
07:51;07:53;"And then everyone was gathered at the end of the dock."
07:53;07:59;"And then we made our entrance in this little rowboat with an outboard motor on it."
07:59;08:00;"Yeah."
08:00;08:03;"And dad's friend Tom was wearing a suit and a captain's hat."
08:03;08:04;"And brought us in."
08:04;08:05;"We got out of the dock and then he just sped out."
08:05;08:06;"Amazing."
08:06;08:07;"Oh, what a boat."
08:07;08:08;"I guess I'll never know the reason why."

15:40;16:10;"I guess I'll never know the reason why."
16:10;16:16;"So Jake, we need to think about something vaguely uplifting, at least something proactive"
16:16;16:18;"or things that we can do."
16:18;16:21;"You received a listener email about Puerto Rico."
16:21;16:22;"I did."
16:22;16:23;"Let's read it."
16:23;16:24;"Okay."
16:24;16:25;"Hi, Jake."
16:25;16:30;"I'm Kamiya, pronounced like the Hall & Oates song, Kamiya."
16:30;16:35;"Her name is spelled with one L. The Hall & Oates song is spelled with two Ls, like Kamiya."
16:35;16:42;"Let's listen to the Hall & Oates song so that we know."
16:42;17:06;"Very soundless."
17:06;17:24;"Kamiya."
17:24;17:25;"Okay."
17:26;17:30;"So neither Camilla nor Kamiya, Kamiya."
17:30;17:31;"It's almost like chameleon."
17:31;17:32;"Right."
17:32;17:33;"Okay."
17:33;17:34;"Hi, Jake."
17:34;17:36;"I'm Kamiya from Puerto Rico."
17:36;17:39;"I'm also a longtime time crisis listener."
17:39;17:44;"I know there's a very slim chance of you reading this and I feel strange writing to your email"
17:44;17:48;"as I imagine everyone who writes to you about TC feels."
17:48;17:52;"I should let the listeners know they don't need to feel strange about writing to my email"
17:52;17:55;"about this, but Puerto Rico needs help."
17:55;17:59;"About a week ago, Puerto Rico got hit by the worst hurricane in its history, Hurricane"
17:59;18:00;"Maria."
18:00;18:02;"The country is a disaster."
18:02;18:07;"Some towns have been completely flooded while others have no way of entry or no communication"
18:07;18:10;"has been made with them whatsoever."
18:10;18:12;"We don't know the exact number of casualties yet."
18:12;18:16;"Puerto Rico's return to normalcy is very, very far away."
18:16;18:20;"I finally found us some signal to write to you guys."
18:20;18:25;"So I was wondering if there is any possibility of you guys on the show mentioning these ways"
18:25;18:27;"that listeners can help if they wish to."
18:27;18:33;"So we're going to tweet out from the time crisis, Twitter account links for people to"
18:33;18:34;"donate money."
18:34;18:35;"Some of these organizations."
18:35;18:36;"Yep."
18:36;18:40;"I donated to one already that was like, it said the first lady of Puerto Rico started"
18:40;18:41;"it."
18:41;18:43;"It's so crazy sometimes knowing where to donate."
18:43;18:48;"Like people, man, if people, I like GoFundMe is when you can just go direct to somebody,"
18:48;18:52;"but so I was just like looking for the best place to donate and I see the first lady of"
18:52;18:53;"Puerto Rico."
18:53;18:54;"That seems to make sense."
18:54;18:56;"But then there was like all these like on the website, it's like we want to thank all"
18:56;19:01;"our corporate sponsors and it was like McDonald's and all these like harsh places like that."
19:01;19:04;"Look if McDonald's is giving money to help the people of Puerto Rico, no problem."
19:04;19:05;"Yep."
19:05;19:09;"It's just like kind of weird seeing like all these like corporate logos on the thing."
19:09;19:13;"Did you Google that organization to like see if there was any weird chatter about it?"
19:13;19:14;"I didn't see any weird chatter."
19:14;19:20;"I mean it was on all like respect quote unquote respectable newspapers were like hyping that"
19:20;19:21;"one up."
19:21;19:24;"But anyway, we're actually getting somebody from Puerto Rico giving us some ideas."
19:24;19:27;"So we'll tweet that out to everybody, encourage everybody to donate."
19:27;19:28;"Yeah."
19:28;19:31;"So she gave us three or four links to send out."
19:31;19:32;"All right."
19:32;19:33;"Well thanks Camelia."
19:33;19:38;"I know the US has way too much going on, but Puerto Ricans are suffering."
19:38;19:39;"We are American citizens too."
19:39;19:42;"Just a small mention of our situation would mean the world."
19:42;19:43;"Thank you so much."
19:43;19:44;"P.S."
19:44;19:46;"I've listened to every single episode of the show."
19:46;19:48;"It helped me pass pre-calculus."
19:48;19:53;"I would always listen to the show while I studied."
19:53;19:56;"It's also exposed me to a bunch of music I'd never heard before."
19:56;19:57;"You guys are sick."
19:57;19:59;"I hate to be writing under these circumstances."
19:59;20:03;"I wanted to write about how that Coldplay song that was always on the top five is kind"
20:03;20:07;"of my success story or success song."
20:07;20:08;"Long story."
20:08;20:10;"Oh, you know what?"
20:10;20:11;"Thanks."
20:11;20:14;"Camelia, maybe when things settle down, we'll get part two of your email."
20:14;20:15;"Yeah."
20:15;20:17;"I assume she's talking about I want something just like this."
20:17;20:19;"Chainsmokers featuring Coldplay."
20:19;20:20;"Great song."
20:21;20:22;"Best Chainsmokers song."
20:22;20:23;"I'd love to hear about that."
20:23;20:24;"I love Coldplay song."
20:24;20:25;"Really?"
20:25;20:27;"You can make the argument."
20:27;20:28;"That and Yellow."
20:28;20:31;"Yeah, something early."
20:31;20:32;"Yellow is the best early Coldplay song."
20:32;20:33;"Yeah."
20:33;20:36;"Something just like this is the best late one."
20:36;20:38;"I heard that at the gym the other day."
20:38;20:39;"It's a good song."
20:39;20:40;"Oh, man."
20:40;20:41;"I was at the gym this morning."
20:41;20:42;"Yeah."
20:42;20:44;"They blasted November Rain."
20:44;20:45;"Oh."
20:45;20:46;"In its entirety."
20:46;20:47;"The whole thing?"
20:47;20:48;"It was so good."
20:48;20:49;"That's a long song."
20:49;20:54;"It is a beautiful song and weirdly good for working out."
20:54;20:55;"Because it picks up at the end and you really go hard."
20:55;20:56;"Yeah."

51:15;51:38;"I just end up walking in the November rain."
51:39;51:44;"Maybe he's just trying to paint a picture of like the opening of the song is so wholesome."
51:44;51:46;"Mama Jesus America Elvis horse's boyfriend."
51:46;51:53;"And then maybe this is about like how that innocence gets shattered through heartbreak"
51:53;51:56;"or whatever to the vampires just represent something kind of darker, more evil in the"
51:56;51:57;"world."
51:57;51:58;"Yeah."
51:58;52:05;"Like you're a good girl having a pool party in Reseda, but just a few blocks away on Ventura"
52:05;52:06;"Boulevard are vampires."
52:06;52:09;"There's a vampire emotional vampires."
52:09;52:15;"I'm picturing just like a really pale, like pasty, like goth dude walking down Ventura"
52:15;52:20;"Boulevard at like 90 degree heat wearing like a trench coat."
52:20;52:21;"Just going into like a subway."
52:21;52:25;"Let me get the six inch."
52:25;52:26;"This good girl."
52:26;52:27;"She's like going to subway."
52:27;52:30;"She just got her driver's license, drives a subway by herself for the first time, sees"
52:30;52:32;"this dude and just like, what?"
52:32;52:34;"This is like gross."
52:34;52:35;"He's no Elvis."
52:35;52:38;"He's just like, just like punk dude."
52:38;52:39;"Yeah."
52:39;52:41;"In the video they have some actual like, Oh really?"
52:41;52:42;"She starts hanging out with the goth dudes."
52:42;52:45;"I haven't seen the video in like, you know, 20 years."
52:45;52:46;"Great video."
52:46;52:49;"So then he says all the bad boys are standing in the shadows and the good girls are home"
52:49;52:50;"with broken hearts."
52:50;52:52;"He's kind of like generalizing too."
52:52;52:55;"Just like, look at this world."
52:55;52:57;"You got vampires walking around."
52:57;53:00;"Why can't the boys and the girls just be together and have a good time?"
53:00;53:01;"Because life's not like that."
53:01;53:03;"People break up, things fall apart."
53:03;53:07;"It reminds me of like, you hear those stories of like, yeah, they got divorced."
53:07;53:13;"They had a 32 year marriage and he just decided to, he wanted to live by himself in an apartment"
53:13;53:14;"by the golf course."
53:14;53:15;"Yeah."
53:15;53:16;"Free falling."
53:16;53:17;"Right."
53:17;53:18;"You know, it's just like, what?"
53:18;53:20;"All right, dude, I get it."
53:20;53:22;"You always felt like your wife didn't support your golfing."
53:22;53:25;"Now you can golf as much as you want, man."
53:25;53:26;"How does that feel?"
53:26;53:29;"When I hear those stories, that really throws me off kilter."
53:29;53:33;"You know, it's funny too, is like when people talk about relationships, one of the classic"
53:33;53:36;"cliches that people talk about is I don't want to die alone."
53:36;53:40;"You're going to, or like in a breakup, you don't know how to, you don't know how to deal"
53:40;53:41;"with you're going to die alone."
53:41;53:42;"It's like in a movie or something."
53:42;53:43;"You're going to die alone."
53:43;53:44;"Yep."
53:44;53:45;"I still am."
53:45;53:46;"We all die alone."
53:46;53:47;"No, you don't have to die alone."
53:47;53:51;"You could die surrounded by family when you enter purgatory and go to either heaven or"
53:51;53:57;"hell that will be alone or it'll be just you and St. Peter or Lord Satan, but you don't"
53:57;53:58;"have to die alone."
53:58;54:00;"I guess that phrase has multiple meanings, but anyway, go ahead."
54:00;54:06;"When you enter the afterlife, you might be alone, but then you enter the black nothingness"
54:06;54:09;"of zero consciousness and your body rots into the ground."
54:09;54:10;"Oh, well that's a pessimistic view."
54:10;54:13;"I think you'll meet, then you'll be alone for about five minutes and then you'll meet"
54:13;54:18;"your ancestors and go get a slice of pizza."
54:18;54:21;"So people always, that's this big fear that most people have that I don't want to die"
54:21;54:25;"alone or it's a harsh thing to say to somebody is you're going to die alone."
54:25;54:29;"In movies they always say that like, you don't know what to, so I can't imagine saying that"
54:29;54:31;"stuff."
54:31;54:32;"You know what?"
54:32;54:35;"Yeah, you're going to die alone."
54:35;54:39;"I mean in movies, that's what I'm trying to accomplish here by breaking up with you."
54:39;54:40;"Right."
54:40;54:44;"I'd rather die alone than live another eight years with you and then die when I'm 81."
54:44;54:45;"I'm 73."
54:45;54:48;"I'm going to, I'm bringing up with you now we're divorcing."
54:48;54:49;"Oh God, I'd rather die alone."
54:49;54:50;"Thank you."
54:50;54:51;"I mean, it's brutal."
54:51;54:55;"The price of freedom oftentimes is somebody else's heartbreak."
54:55;54:59;"Just like the price of American freedom is a lack of freedom for many people around the"
54:59;55:00;"world."
55:00;55:01;"Also true."
55:01;55:02;"Maybe that's what Tom was thinking about."
55:02;55:08;"But yeah, so this idea of dying alone, like to be in your sixties or seventies and be"
55:08;55:12;"like, eh, you're rolling the dice hard because you might not meet somebody else."
55:12;55:16;"And you're like, you're saying to yourself, I'd rather die alone."
55:16;55:18;"I'd rather just, I don't know."
55:18;55:19;"What do you read?"
55:19;55:21;"Yeah, I play golf, watch TV."
55:21;55:28;"Even like the most like bawling social people in their seventies, their social calendar"
55:28;55:31;"is not morning to night pact."
55:31;55:32;"Nope."
55:32;55:33;"Okay."
55:33;55:34;"Let's get in the third verse."
55:34;55:35;"I'm free."
55:35;55:36;"I'm free falling."
55:36;55:37;"Yeah, I'm free."
55:37;55:38;"Free falling."
55:38;55:39;"I'm free."
55:39;55:40;"Free falling."
55:40;55:41;"I'm free."
55:41;55:42;"Free falling."
55:42;55:43;"I'm free."
55:43;55:44;"Free falling."
55:44;55:45;"I'm free."
55:45;55:46;"Free falling."
55:46;55:47;"I'm free."
55:47;55:48;"Free falling."
55:48;55:49;"I'm free."
55:49;55:50;"Free falling."
55:50;55:51;"I'm free."
55:51;55:52;"Free falling."
55:52;55:53;"I'm free."
55:53;55:54;"Free falling."
55:54;55:55;"I'm free."
55:55;55:56;"Free falling."
55:56;56:00;"Oh, this part's so dope."
56:00;56:08;"I wonder if Jeff Lynn's singing in there."
56:08;56:13;"Oh, it might be."
56:13;56:16;"It's such a simple interlude."
56:16;56:21;"The song's kind of slow too when you really think about it."
56:21;56:22;"And then the snare."
56:22;56:23;"Military drums."
56:23;56:24;"Oh, he wants to go to LA."
56:24;56:25;"Right."
56:25;56:26;"Over Mulholland."
56:26;56:27;"Well."
56:27;56:28;"Name in the sky."
56:28;56:29;"I'm gonna free fall."
56:29;56:30;"Out into nothing."
56:30;56:31;"Gonna leave this world for a while."
56:31;56:32;"Now I'm free."
56:32;56:33;"Free."
56:33;56:46;"That's my favorite verse."
56:46;56:50;"It also makes me think of Lebowski to bring it back to the beginning of the show when"
56:50;56:54;"the dream sequence when the dude is on the carpet and he's going over LA and all of a"
56:54;56:55;"sudden he just free falls."
56:55;56:56;"Yeah."
56:56;56:59;"He's fading to like the weird bowling alley nightmare."
56:59;57:00;"Oh, yeah."
57:00;57:01;"Yeah."
57:01;57:02;"Okay."
57:02;57:04;"So here he says, I want to glide down over Mulholland."
57:04;57:09;"So again, to listeners who are not familiar with LA geography, every verse has something"
57:09;57:10;"about LA geography."
57:10;57:11;"So she lives in Reseda."
57:11;57:12;"That's in the valley."
57:12;57:15;"That's across the mountains from LA."
57:15;57:16;"Just about Ventura Boulevard."
57:16;57:17;"That's also in the valley."
57:17;57:18;"That's the commercial thing."
57:18;57:22;"Now, Mulholland is interesting because Mulholland is the street."
57:22;57:24;"There's like Mulholland Drive."
57:24;57:26;"People probably heard of the David Lynch movie."
57:26;57:29;"That's a famous LA street."
57:29;57:33;"Really what it is, if you look at LA, it's like LA is this big flat expanse and then"
57:33;57:34;"you have mountains."
57:34;57:35;"The Santa Monica Mountains."
57:35;57:36;"The Santa Monica Mountains."
57:36;57:39;"And then you have the valley on the other side."
57:39;57:43;"So at the very top of the Santa Monica Mountains is a street called Mulholland."
57:43;57:45;"It snakes along the spine."
57:45;57:46;"It's yeah, the very top."
57:46;57:51;"So in some ways you could call Mulholland the dividing line between Los Angeles and"
57:51;57:52;"the valley."
57:52;57:57;"So when he says, I want to glide down over Mulholland, he's talking about crossing this"
57:57;58:03;"line between LA, the glittering city of dreams, and the valley."
58:03;58:04;"The drab suburbs."
58:04;58:05;"Drab suburbs."
58:05;58:06;"Okay, so it's interesting."
58:06;58:08;"You were saying that he's saying he wants to go to LA."
58:08;58:10;"This is one thing that I had."
58:10;58:12;"Tom is a dude or the narrator."
58:12;58:14;"Let's call him Tom."
58:14;58:15;"Is a dude from the valley."
58:15;58:17;"High school sweetheart."
58:17;58:18;"She's a good girl."
58:18;58:20;"And then he's a bad boy."
58:20;58:21;"Cheats on her or whatever."
58:21;58:26;"He breaks her heart because, and at first he doesn't even miss her because he just wants"
58:26;58:28;"freedom so badly."
58:28;58:30;"He knows she's great, but he just can't hang."
58:30;58:32;"And then he goes into free fall."
58:32;58:36;"So I'm kind of picturing in a way that she's stuck back in the valley with the vampires"
58:36;58:37;"and stuff."
58:37;58:39;"And maybe he moved to LA or something."
58:39;58:41;"I'm almost picturing like, this is not the story the video tells."
58:41;58:42;"He's part of the band."
58:42;58:43;"He's playing."
58:43;58:48;"Yeah, I'm almost picturing that, that like, she's this good girl who likes Elvis."
58:48;58:49;"She's with this dude."
58:49;58:51;"He just unceremoniously dumps her."
58:51;58:53;"She thought they were going to be together forever."
58:53;58:56;"He unceremoniously dumps her because he's pursuing bigger dreams."
58:56;58:57;"He's starting a power pop band."
58:57;59:00;"He's starting a power pop band."
59:00;59:01;"Playing gigs on the strip."
59:01;59:03;"He's playing gigs on the sunset strip."
59:03;59:05;"He crosses Mulholland, the dividing line."
59:05;59:07;"He's in the city now."
59:07;59:09;"And he's living that freedom."
59:09;59:14;"But sometimes at night when he gets back from a sick gig, Benmont Tench ripping it up on"
59:14;59:15;"the keys."
59:15;59:16;"Now things get quiet."
59:16;59:20;"He has a kind of dark night of the soul and he thinks, wow, it's been pretty cool moving"
59:20;59:22;"to LA and having to start a power pop band."
59:22;59:26;"But as free as I feel, sometimes I almost feel like I'm free falling."
59:26;59:28;"This is all happening so fast."
59:28;59:29;"It's weird."
59:29;59:32;"I'm a, and then he says, maybe I'm a piece of shit."
59:32;59:35;"Like he just signed a big record deal."
59:35;59:39;"And then he thinks back to the girl back home and he's like, everybody's telling him like,"
59:39;59:41;"Tom, you're so great."
59:41;59:42;"Love your new power pop aesthetic."
59:42;59:45;"It's a little classic rock, a little new wave."
59:45;59:46;"I'm hearing some Dylan in there."
59:46;59:47;"I'm hearing a little Dylan in there."
59:47;59:50;"You kind of take me back to the birds."
59:50;59:52;"And everybody's pumping him up."
59:52;59:53;"Big Gene Clark fan."
59:53;59:54;"Yeah."
59:54;59:57;"Stan Lynch, just killing it on the drums."
59:57;59:59;"I hope he's your drummer forever."
59:59;01:00:00;"And he's getting hyped up."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"And then he has these dark night of the souls where he's like, thinks back to this girl"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"whose heart he broke."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"And then he's getting back to his apartment, opening that fridge."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"Just the jar of mayonnaise."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Right."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Exactly."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"That's it."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Single Budweiser."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Right."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Five of the six beers in the six pack gone."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"That's like the symbol of male freedom in America is like a fridge."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Yeah."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Just filthy fridge."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"All right, man."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"You want to go be a bad boy?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"You want to break up with a nice girl?"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"You want to move to LA?"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"You want to go be a rock star?"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"Okay."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"That probably feels pretty good when you're up on stage with Mike Campbell next to you."
01:00:33;01:00:39;"But what about when you get home to that empty apartment and just look at that jar of mayonnaise?"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Then maybe recede."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"It doesn't seem that bad."
01:00:41;01:00:45;"I also love like, I love in songs when people like go between the general stuff and then"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"I Tom Petty is really good at that too."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"Yeah."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"I feel like wax songwriters."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"It's I, I, I, I."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Yeah."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"And he knows how to like kind of paint a scene and then get personal again."
01:00:54;01:00:58;"So with this kind of emotional final verse, now he's really telling us how he feels."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Because in the beginning he said, I'm bad boy."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I don't even miss her."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Yeah."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Stop fronting."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"So now he's saying, I want to glide down over Mulholland."
01:01:07;01:01:11;"I'm picturing him apartment on the sunset strip, thinking back to that girl over the"
01:01:11;01:01:17;"mountain and he almost is envisioning a big Lebowski dream sequence where he flies up"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"over the mountains, glides down over Mulholland."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"He's back in the homeland in the Valley."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"She's only like 15 miles away."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Right?"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"Yeah."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Glide down."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"Different world though."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"Right."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"Yeah."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"A different world."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"It's like Jersey and New York."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"Exactly."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"And he's like, I'm going to fly over Mulholland."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:01:47;01:02:13;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:02:13;01:02:20;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:02:34;01:03:01;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"I'm going to glide down over Mulholland."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"And he leaves it on just like such a dark note."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"Because really, there's more chorus, but that's the final--"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Damn."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"That's the final verse."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"I'm going to free fall out into nothing."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Going to leave this world for a while."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Sounds like suicidal."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"Almost, man."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"Yeah. You broke that good girl's heart, man."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Now you're almost questioning the point of living."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And then just kind of a good breakdown chorus."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Free falling down the street."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"I'm free."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Free falling."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"No."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Free falling down the street."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Free falling."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"Free falling down the street."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"Free falling."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"I'm free."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Free falling down the street."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"Free falling."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"I also just kind of love that this is like his biggest song."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"He's this classic American songwriter."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"And his biggest song"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"is about"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"the two sides of freedom."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"I love that."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"It's just like real American poetry."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"So confident, too, to write something so simple"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"and straightforward and not try to make it"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"arty."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Right. He's great at that."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"The choruses are always straightforward."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"It takes courage to just do something really straightforward"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"and be like,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"""This isn't the hippest thing,"" but"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"I guess he was 39 at the time and had nothing to prove."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Which is great."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"Although it was his solo album, so he was stepping out on his own."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"It's cool that"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"his solo album did so well."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"And it's big. Because when Bruce"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"made his first solo record without the"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"E Street Band, the Tunnel of Love album"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"in '87."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Not his first, but his first studio."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Which is a great record. But it was definitely like"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"the energy of the whole"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"Bruce Springsteen project sort of like"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"diminished a little bit."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"It wasn't like a smash hit the way Full Moon was."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Yeah, it's a great album, but it's more like"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Bruce being like, ""Enough with the big stuff."
01:06:30;01:06:32;"I just want to get more personal."" And Tom kind of had it both ways."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"Right. Which is very cool."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"So we got Josh Ells calling in now."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Tom and Bruce."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Tom and Bruce. It all comes back to Tom and Bruce."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"We got Josh Ells calling in,"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"who's a journalist, writes for Rolling Stone,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"among other places, who wrote a big story"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"on Tom Petty a few years ago."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"So he dug into his notes and he's going to talk"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"to us a little bit. Oh wow. Somebody actually spent time"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"with the man. We're going deep. Oh yeah."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"Hotline."
01:06:58;01:07:02;"Hey, what's up Josh?"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"What's up man, how you doing? Not bad. Long time"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"no see. I should point out that Josh"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"once profiled Vampire Weekend for Rolling Stone."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Yes, full disclosure. What year?"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"That was on our second album, so it must have been"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"2010 or so. Contra"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"era. Contra era of Vampire."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"That sounds right. So you wrote a big piece"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"on Tom Petty when? June"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"of 2014 was when I"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"was with him and then I came out a couple months later."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Oh, so pretty recently actually."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"So when a Rolling Stone journalist is writing a"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"profile of a major musician"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"like Tom Petty, how does it work?"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Are you hanging with him?"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"You getting 30 minutes on the phone and then"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"calling up Ben Mond"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"to fill in the blanks? How does it work?"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"I did get Ben Mond on the phone from Rome, which"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"was pretty dope. But no, we hung."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Well, I should point out"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"full disclosure that I do work"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"mostly for Rolling Stone, but this"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"the Petty profile is actually for Men's Journal"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"magazine. But it works the same"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"way. So basically"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"there was a"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"publicist who was like, ""Hey, this is when you're"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"going to be there."" And I"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"think I talked to someone from his management company"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"too. This is a very sweet woman named"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"Mary, who I think had worked with"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"him for like 40 years. And"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"they were just like, ""Show up at his"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"house in Malibu"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"and then you guys will just hang."" So I"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"ended up spending most of"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"two days with him. Probably like"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"five or six hours each"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"day. That's a lot of time. Yeah."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"He was just down. I've actually found with"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"a lot of these older, just the real"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"legend dudes that they're actually super"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"easy. Because I think"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"A, he's from an era where"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"you know, almost famous era"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"where people would just come hang for like"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"a week. So it wasn't to like get on the phone"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"for half an hour or like meet for lunch somewhere."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"It was just like, ""Let's come chop it up."""
01:08:44;01:08:46;"And also he just like"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"didn't have much going on. I mean, he"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"was in between. He'd finished making the"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"record that they put out that year"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"and then they were still a couple months from touring."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"So he was just kind of chilling at his"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"house in Malibu. That's cool that he let you actually"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"come to his house. Because"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"yeah, maybe you're right. Like he came from this era where"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"you get like Cameron Crowe jumps on the"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"tour bus for a week. So"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"they're like, ""Alright, let's get to know this"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"journalist."" Because one thing that"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"I'm sure you're familiar with and maybe sometimes"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"you're in this position, that I always find"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"funny as somebody who's like"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"done a few interviews and knows a lot of"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"journalists and stuff, is when you read some"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"big profile of"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"a actor or"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"a musician or something. And it's"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"like, ""I met them in the lobby of this"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"hotel where they ordered this."" And there's"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"like these details about what's happening in the lobby"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"and what they ordered. And I remember when I was a"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"kid and I'd read something and I'd be like, ""Wow,"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"I guess they stay at that hotel"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"a lot or something?"" And then you just realize"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"they literally came to town to do"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"a day of interviews. One after"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"another, they're sitting in this restaurant in a hotel they've"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"never been at in their life. And the idea"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"that you're taking meaning from that"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"is so harsh. Just like,"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"""At the Bowery Hotel, I sat down with"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"Florence and the Machine"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"as they chomped down"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"on an artisanal"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"broccoli rabe pizza."" And you're painting"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"a picture and you're like, for them, they're like bewildered."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"They just got off a plane. They're like at some hotel."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"That's their favorite hotel."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"You didn't know that? And even if it is their"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"favorite hotel, it still says so little about"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"them. So anyway,"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"as I've gotten older, you kind of read the profiles"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"where you can tell the journalist is doing their best"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"to paint a picture when they sat"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"down at a random"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"hotel restaurant for 45 minutes"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"with a jet-lagged person who"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"doesn't even know where they are. And you kind of forget"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"that the publicist is standing right there."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"They came down, they have no idea where they are,"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"and we just started talking. Versus"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"something like this where you actually go see this dude's"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"house. You're literally seeing his"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"environment. Yeah, totally."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"I feel like way more often than"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"I like, my job is"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"trying to disguise all that stuff that you were"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"just talking about. Like trying to make"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"45 minutes at the Bowery Hotel with Florence and"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"the Machine not feel like 45"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"minutes. But yeah, I feel like a lot"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"of my job is trying to hide that"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"or just write around it in a"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"way, disguise how artificial the"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"whole thing was. But yeah, he really"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"was just open. I mean, he didn't, he"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"wasn't like showing me around"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"his bedroom and I didn't get to crash"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"there. So it wasn't fully just like, ""Hey,"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"come..."" So he didn't give you a tour?"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I'm trying to remember, actually. I feel like I"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"asked and he just kind of, I don't know,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"he changed the subject somehow. Also, the"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"flip side of the old dudes is like they've done"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"this so much that they can be really slick"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"about sharing what they want to share"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"and not sharing what they want to share. Right, you'll ask"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"a question and he'll just say exactly what he wants to"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"say. Yeah. So you get to"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"his house. He was back in his home studio"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"just like rocking out. He has"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"a stepson who's like in his 20s and"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"his stepson had this"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"friend who was like going through a hard time"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"and Petty kind of took"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"this kid under his wing and brought him out"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"on tour. It was actually really sweet."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"I mean, it's just, it's those little things that"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"really show you who a person is and the"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"fact that he was not doing this for any kind of"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"public goodwill. It was just like"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"a nice thing to do. So he kind of like semi"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"adopted this kid. So"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Petty brought this kid out on tour and then he got"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"really into music and started playing"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"guitar and then he formed his own"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"band and then so Petty was actually"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"producing his stepson's"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"friend's band. Oh, that's"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"tight. Tom Petty just willing to give his time."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"Yeah, I mean that was one of the things"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"that I found super cool about him was"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"he did not seem jaded"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"in the slightest and he was like,"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"you know, I love doing this and I get"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"inspiration from these guys and"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"yeah, I mean that could sound super corny"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"or like saccharine or something but"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"he was just psyched to be making music"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"with some young kids and that they were making"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"rock music and I got the sense that like"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"anytime he could be in a studio with"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"whoever, he was pretty stoked."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"So what else did you learn about Tom from"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"spending that time with him? We heard that he is"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"a pretty big stoner. I mean, he wrote a lot of"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"songs about smoking weed."
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Yeah, he smoked a lot of weed."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"So even when the"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"journalist comes over, he's"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"still getting high? Yeah, I don't know"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"how high, I mean, I think he just"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"sort of maintained a baseline high"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"that maybe wasn't even high, that was just like"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Tom Petty. Smoking joints,"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"pipe, bong, what, vaping?"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"No, he was vaping."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"I was really surprised. He was vaping?"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"Yeah, he was vaping and"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"he was just kind of like, it was just"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"sort of all day. So all day he's just"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"hitting that vape a little bit but he's not"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"noticeably high. Wake and bake."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"He talked about how he was like, kind of"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"spacey sometimes. I didn't know this because I had never"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"met Tom Petty so I don't know that I would have... Oh, he referred"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"to himself as spacey? Yeah, yeah,"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"yeah. He actually said he stopped driving."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"He's like, ""I'm too spacey."" While he"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"puffed on his like, 15th hit of his"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"vape pit that day. Well, if you're hitting a vape"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"pen 15 times a day,"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"you probably shouldn't drive. Tom Petty,"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"he was such a cool, mellow dude. He's"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"such an icon of just like a chill,"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"cool dude and it's great to hear"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"that he's actually like a nice guy too."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"And I would feel like he's very underrated"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"in terms of the music stoner"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"canon. People know that he smokes"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"weed but it's like, he might have smoked"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"as much weed as like Willie Nelson or something."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"But I feel like he wasn't out there"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"like throwing like pot leaves on"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"CDs or anything. It wasn't part of his"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"identity. That's cool. Just a dude"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"who smokes. Yeah, totally. I was"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"surprised by this. He's like super into history."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Like he was a real like, World War"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"II buff. He knew like a frightening"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"amount about the JFK assassination"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"and he was a real conspiracy theorist. He's like"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"definitely was more than one dude. Oh, for real?"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"Yeah, yeah. He had a lot of thoughts."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"But he told me he's super into"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Thomas Jefferson. He said one of his"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"favorite things to do whenever he"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"was in DC would be, ""So I'll"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"wait until it's really late at night and"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"I'll go get super stunned"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"and go sit at the Jefferson Memorial"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"and just read walls."" So I just pictured Tom"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Petty sitting at the foot of that giant statue just"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"like super spaced and reading"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"the wisdom of one of the founders of our country."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Can you imagine just like you're on"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"an eighth grade school field trip, you"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"and some of the bad kids like"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"sneak out of the hotel, get past like the"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"teacher, you like, somebody"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"has a fake ID, you get some beers and you're"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"just like walking around empty DC"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"and then you like roll up on some like"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"empty monument or something."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"There's nobody there and then you just see this like"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"thin blonde man"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"hitting a weed vape."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"""Yo, is that Tom Petty?"""
01:15:08;01:15:10;"""Don't mind me."""
01:15:10;01:15:12;"""Be sick."""
01:15:12;01:15:14;"We were kind of doing an interpretation"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"of Free Fallen and talking about how"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"it seems like a very personal"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"song that's about the price"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"that an individual pays for freedom."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Whether that's leaving a broken heart"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"behind or whatever."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Feeling like you're free fallen. But we were also"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"talking about how that kind of intersects with this"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"American idea of freedom. What's the"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"price that America pays for freedom?"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"Maybe that's how Thomas Jefferson felt after"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"he wrote the Declaration of Independence."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"America's free, but"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"""At what cost?"""
01:15:42;01:15:44;"""A cost borne by others."""
01:15:44;01:15:46;"Exactly."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"So Petty was pretty down on America."
01:15:48;01:15:50;"He just went on kind of a diatribe"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"about how we were living in a very"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"anti-intellectual moment and"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Fox News was like"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"banana republic sh*t and"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"he wasn't so optimistic about"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"our collective ability to make smart decisions."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Oh damn. This is two years before Trump."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Oh yeah, that's even before Trump."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Well that's good to hear because we want to believe that"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Tom Petty's on the right side of freedom."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"And also one thing I want to say about Tom Petty too is"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"we always try to check ourselves"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"on this show. Jake and I"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"are both born into northeastern and"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"liberal families."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"It's not particularly hard for us to"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"be like f*ck Trump."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"But one interesting thing about Tom Petty is"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"he's this deeply southern dude."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"He kind of wrestled with his"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"southern identity because he famously"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"did a tour for an album that was"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"kind of about the south. An album called"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Southern Accents and he had a confederate flag"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"on stage because this album was supposed"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"to be about southern heritage."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"And you know in the 80s"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"it wasn't quite the hot button topic it was today"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"or at least there wasn't the internet for people to discuss"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"it in the same way. And he's one of"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"the few dudes, later in life"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"he fully disavowed it and he's like I shouldn't have done that."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Whatever that flag might mean to my"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"heritage, it's not right. It means too many"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"other horrible things. There really"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"is like this deep compassion and"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"complexity beneath the surface of Tom Petty I think."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"Yeah totally. If I remember correctly"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"him using the flag was like"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"slightly nuanced. So even in the 80s"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"he was trying to make a nuanced point. Although"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"obviously I'm sure to a lot of people"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"they were like alright."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Even if that is the case we're not trying to see the confederate"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"flag on stage. But at least"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"because you see other guys from that era"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"not to make excuses"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"for them but just as a point of comparison"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"you have these other guys from the era. Some of these"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"older classic rock dudes are some of the most"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"crotchety, racist"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"just like don't you tell me what to do."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Like kind of taking all the wrong things away"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"from like the rock ethos."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Freedom. Yeah like the wrong type of freedom"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"so you probably shouldn't have done it in the"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"first place but like we will give Tom Petty"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"some credit for like actually reckoning"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"with that and apologizing for it."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Well thanks so much for calling in Josh."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"We really appreciate getting a more personal"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"perspective on the man"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"Tom Petty. Thank you guys for having me."
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Alright thanks for calling in dude. I'll have you again"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"soon. Have a good one man."
01:18:02;01:18:09;"I said the woman I heard his cry, told him that you loved him so, turned around, let him go."
01:18:09;01:18:14;"They said you better watch yourself or you're gonna get hurt yourself."
01:18:14;01:18:18;"Someone's going to tell you lies, cut you down to size."
01:18:18;01:18:21;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that!"
01:18:21;01:18:26;"Oh I love you baby, don't do me like that."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that!"
01:18:30;01:18:34;"Someday I might need you baby, don't do me like that."
01:18:34;01:18:42;"Listen little kid, you see, maybe you will bury me, if you were in a public eye, give it someone else a try."
01:18:42;01:18:46;"And you know you better watch yourself, or you're gonna get hurt yourself."
01:18:46;01:18:51;"Someone's going to tell you lies, cut you down to size."
01:18:51;01:18:54;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that!"
01:18:54;01:18:59;"Oh I love you baby, don't, don't, don't, don't!"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"Don't do me like that, don't do me like that!"
01:19:02;01:19:06;"Oh I need you baby, don't do me like that."
01:19:06;01:19:14;"'Cause somewhere deep down inside, someone is saying, love doesn't last that long."
01:19:14;01:19:22;"I've had this feeling inside, night and day, it never can be taken no more."
