00:00;00:12;"Time Crisis 2017. Today marks the first time crisis in the era of the new president. We"
00:12;00:17;"won't be talking about him too much, but we will be talking with Bart Elmore, author of"
00:17;00:24;"Citizen Coke, The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism. We'll be talking about the new film, The Founder,"
00:24;00:28;"plus digging a little deeper into the connection between McDonald's and Walt Disney. This is"
00:28;00:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-Beats 1."
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, the war beneath All my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the boss had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:20;"Leave it on me babe"
01:20;01:25;"Time Crisis 2017. Can you believe it?"
01:25;01:28;"Sort of. Sort of."
01:28;01:53;"Back in LA, I'm here with Jake. This is the first episode of 2017, which also means it's the first episode of the Trump presidency. Plenty to talk about there, but we know that the true TC heads have been waiting a long time for us to get back in the mix, so we want to start you off with some real time crisis type stuff."
01:53;01:59;"So, not only am I joined by Jake, we also got Seinfeld 2000 back in the mix. What's up Seinfeld 2000?"
01:59;02:00;"Hey, what's up?"
02:00;02:09;"First off, I put you in charge of running the Time Crisis Twitter account. Time Crisis 2000. I haven't been keeping a close eye on it. How's it been going?"
02:09;02:15;"It's fully viral. We got almost 2,500 Twitter followers, which is almost as many as you have."
02:15;02:16;"Well, I-"
02:16;02:17;"It's twice as many as me."
02:17;02:18;"Really?"
02:18;02:19;"Three times the amount."
02:19;02:20;"You got over a thousand?"
02:20;02:21;"No."
02:21;02:31;"Okay, well, Seinfeld, I want to say one thing. I haven't been looking at it every day, but I noticed that I think it got to about 2,500 very quickly."
02:31;02:32;"Yeah."
02:32;02:35;"And the growth has really slowed."
02:35;02:45;"Yeah, well, you haven't really been pumping it. I mean, nobody here has really been supporting it the way I have, so it's been its own autonomous thing, but if you want to lend some of your juice to it-"
02:45;02:48;"That's not how virality works."
02:48;02:51;"Virality comes from content."
02:51;02:53;"Content is hot fire."
02:53;02:57;"Okay, I want you to get to 5K."
02:57;02:59;"By when?"
02:59;03:01;"Two weeks. Can you do it?"
03:01;03:06;"If we can mention the Twitter account every 10 minutes throughout this episode, I can guarantee you-"
03:06;03:22;"Okay, we have a Time Crisis Twitter. It's @TimeCrisis2000, and it's run by Seinfeld 2000. But anyway, Seinfeld, I wanted to have you on for this first segment, because as we said, the world's changed in many ways."
03:22;03:37;"But Time Crisis, we talk about what's happening in the world, but it's also supposed to be a brief Sunday respite from some of the brutality of what's going on. And it's important to continue to take these moments to enjoy culture."
03:37;03:45;"So I wanted to talk about a song, because originally this was a music show, before it became a corporate food history and politics."
03:45;03:52;"Originally this was a music show, so I want to play you guys a song. I assume you know it. Let's just listen to it first."
03:52;03:54;"It's a jazz tune."
04:22;04:24;"Yikes."
04:24;04:29;"So that's a classic tune. Who can identify it?"
04:29;04:31;"It's a Fraser theme."
04:31;04:43;"That's the Fraser theme. So it's in a jazz style. It's a very notable 90s TV theme song, because it's jazz, and because- who's that on vocals?"
04:43;04:44;"Kelsey."
04:44;04:49;"That's Kelsey Grammer, the star of Fraser, singing the show's theme song, which is pretty rare."
04:49;04:58;"So Seinfeld 2000, can you contextualize Fraser? As somebody who really cares a lot about 90s TV, just explain what Fraser is, in case anybody at home is not familiar."
04:58;05:06;"Okay, well, to understand Fraser, I think you've got to take it back to another show called Cheers. Do you remember Cheers, the TV show?"
05:06;05:07;"Vaguely. Ted Danson."
05:07;05:21;"Kelsey Grammer, Fraser was a character who was in that show, and he was kind of the erudite, educated doctor who would come in, and he'd provide his sort of elevated, highbrow perspective."
05:21;05:35;"Cheers ends, and a few years later, Fraser has his own spinoff, where he's now set in Seattle. He's a radio host. He lives with his father, and has a dog named Eddie. That's his father's dog."
05:35;05:39;"And is there a jazz element to the show? Does he play a little sax on the side?"
05:39;05:40;"He's sophisticated."
05:40;05:44;"Yeah, he liked jazz. He's a sophisticated man."
05:44;05:48;"It's like Carrie on Homeland. She's a big jazz head."
05:48;05:55;"Oh my god, I totally forgot. I stopped watching Homeland because it got so racist. But I guess that was her redeeming quality."
05:55;05:59;"And that show has the worst theme music of any show in history."
05:59;06:00;"Oh yeah, it has this kind of like…"
06:00;06:01;"Collage-y."
06:01;06:02;"Yeah, yeah."
06:02;06:04;"Like, jazzy, collage-y."
06:04;06:06;"Yeah, there's that like…"
06:06;06:20;"Homeland is the original La La Land. I just realized the connection. They're both lands, and they're both about jazz. La La Land is kind of like, they didn't want to touch some of those more political elements."
06:20;06:22;"Okay, but anyway, back to Fraser."
06:22;06:23;"Yeah."
06:23;06:24;"Wait, I got a question for you."
06:24;06:25;"Shoot."
06:25;06:30;"We all know that you're a huge fan of NBC in the 90s. Seinfeld, Friends, you name it, right?"
06:30;06:31;"Not Friends."
06:31;06:33;"Oh, you don't like Friends?"
06:33;06:34;"Dude."
06:34;06:35;"Okay, alright, alright."
06:35;06:36;"Follow me on…"
06:36;06:44;"You specifically like Seinfeld. Okay, so we know hardcore Seinfeld heads hate Friends. Where do they fall on Fraser?"
06:44;06:53;"Fraser's cool. I mean, Fraser never really tried to ape the Seinfeld formula. It was doing its own thing. You know, the two shows kind of complemented each other."
06:53;06:54;"I think they were on different nights of the week."
06:54;06:56;"That's why you hate Friends. You think it was aping Seinfeld."
06:56;07:08;"Yeah, what they did was that they took the core elements of Seinfeld and they tried to pretty them up and, you know, we'll have better looking people and we'll have more people and the apartment will be nicer and on and on. Give me a break."
07:08;07:09;"Wow."
07:09;07:10;"Sand off all the edges."
07:10;07:11;"Right?"
07:11;07:12;"Exactly."
07:12;07:23;"But I never thought of them as directly competing because Seinfeld tonally was very unique and it was ironic and it was original. Friends was just like a straightforward sitcom, right?"
07:23;07:26;"I didn't think that they were even trying to go for the same…"
07:26;07:34;"I think Friends sort of like also had a bit of that focus on like the minutia of the day and like the stories were very small."
07:34;07:44;"I know what you mean. Friends is kind of like a more basic Seinfeld. But frankly, they're both kind of basic compared to the erudite, jazzy Seattle atmosphere of Fraser."
07:44;07:48;"Okay, I thought that the Fraser song was a Joni Mitchell song."
07:48;07:50;"Wait, you thought this was a Joni Mitchell song?"
07:50;08:03;"I thought it was a cover of a Joni Mitchell song. Yeah. Okay, can someone cue up the last song on Court and Spark? The 1974 Joni Mitchell album, Court and Spark, the last song."
08:03;08:07;"Oh, this is the song. You think it's Twisted by Joni Mitchell?"
08:07;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:11;"Okay, it's jazzy. I'll give you that."
08:30;08:31;"Do you like this song?"
08:31;08:36;"Not really. It's the worst song on Court and Spark, which is an amazing record."
08:43;08:47;"Oh, wow. So Nick just found some info."
08:47;08:49;"Okay, and this song was about an analyst."
08:49;08:57;"Okay, so you're right. Initially, okay, I didn't know this. Initially, in the pilot, they used this as the theme song."
08:57;08:58;"Boom."
08:58;08:59;"But then they couldn't afford it."
08:59;09:00;"Boom."
09:00;09:01;"All right. Wow, great ear, Jake."
09:01;09:04;"Starting 2017 in a very strong way."
09:13;09:22;"So that was not part of the story that I found, because part of the reason I wanted to listen to the Frazier song is because I read the story about how it was composed."
09:22;09:27;"So one interesting thing, so in the Joni Mitchell song, she says, ""My analyst told me."""
09:27;09:34;"And Frazier is about an analyst, about a very erudite, sophisticated Seattle psychiatrist."
09:34;09:44;"However, if you listen to the actual Frazier theme song, you're not going to hear a lot of chitter-chatter about psychiatry."
09:44;09:46;"If anything, he's talking about food."
09:46;09:47;"Right."
09:47;09:56;"I found this great blog where the songwriter, composer Bruce Miller, finally opened up all these years later."
09:56;09:57;"[Laughter]"
09:57;09:59;"Broke his silence."
09:59;10:03;"This is what Bruce Miller, the composer of the song, had to say."
10:03;10:10;"""I was told they wanted something pretty eclectic and jazzy. We now know. They wanted something that sounded like that Joni Mitchell song."
10:10;10:14;"But to avoid any direct references to specific subject matter."
10:14;10:23;"So it was necessary to stay away from words about psychiatry, radio shows, the name Frazier, and anything else directly indicating aspects of the show."""
10:23;10:25;"So just think about that."
10:25;10:31;"You're a songwriter, a composer, and you get this huge opportunity, the new Kelsey Grammer show."
10:31;10:33;"And you're psyched."
10:33;10:34;"Cheers, spin-off."
10:35;10:36;"You're psyched."
10:36;10:37;"This is a guaranteed hit."
10:38;10:39;"It's a big gig, right?"
10:39;10:40;"Tenth pole."
10:40;10:42;"And you're like, ""Okay, great. What's the show about?"""
10:42;10:52;"And then you get this kind of zen riddle where they say, ""Well, the thing is, unlike most theme songs, we don't want you to reference what the show's about."
10:52;10:55;"The show's about a psychiatrist, but don't talk about that."""
10:55;10:57;"And you can't even use the guy's name."
10:57;11:00;"It's gotta be a song about nothing."
11:00;11:01;"Basically."
11:01;11:02;"Yeah."
11:02;11:04;"Frazier is the true Seinfeld."
11:04;11:05;"Wait, what? No."
11:05;11:07;"Okay, moving on."
11:07;11:09;"So let's get back to Bruce Miller."
11:09;11:14;"""I immediately wrote the music itself, but then needed a lyric that would work."""
11:14;11:16;"Yeah, no, that's a hell of a challenge."
11:16;11:19;"I immediately ripped off the Joni Mitchell song, ""Twisted."""
11:19;11:21;"Who knows?"
11:21;11:24;"Bruce Miller, he's in a real bind."
11:24;11:26;"So let's get back to him."
11:26;11:33;"""So I called my friend, Darryl Finnessy, who's really talented and really smart."
11:33;11:42;"I gave him the idea of the show, and he called back with the idea of tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
11:42;11:48;"At first I was a bit baffled myself, until he explained that these were things..."""
11:48;11:50;"You ready for the bombshell?"
11:50;11:51;"I'm ready."
11:51;11:56;"""Those are things that are mixed up, just like Frazier Crane's patience."""
11:56;11:59;"[explosion]"
11:59;12:01;"There it is."
12:01;12:03;"That is cosmic."
12:03;12:09;"""Once we agreed on this premise, by the time I finally understood it, we went into completing the song."
12:09;12:13;"I actually did contribute a couple lines, but the heavy lifting here was Darryl."""
12:13;12:16;"So I want everybody to remember that. This is not a solo Bruce Miller joint."
12:16;12:18;"Heavy lifting."
12:18;12:20;"And lucky for me that I went to him in the first place."
12:20;12:24;"And then he actually goes kind of line by line to talk about the whole song."
12:24;12:28;"So we know the opening lines is, ""Hey baby, I hear the blues a-callin'."""
12:28;12:32;"And that refers to Patience with Troubles calling into the radio show."
12:32;12:34;"Okay."
12:34;12:37;"""Tossed salads and scrambled eggs."" We already talked about that."
12:37;12:41;"""But maybe I seem a bit confused."" Frazier's personality was a little confusing."
12:41;12:45;"""Maybe, but I got you pegged."" Frazier does understand these people and helps them."
12:45;12:48;"""But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."""
12:48;12:52;"""It's a tough business, and he's got to deal with those wild people every day."""
12:52;12:56;"""They're callin' again, oh oh."" That's self-explanatory."
12:56;13:00;"""When I first wrote the song, I instantly thought of the great jazz singer Mel Tormé."""
13:00;13:01;"Velvet Fog."
13:01;13:03;"Yeah, the Velvet Fog. A gorgeous voice."
13:03;13:05;"""He would have been perfect."""
13:05;13:08;"But the producers wanted me to try Kelsey."
13:08;13:11;"And of course he really made it his own with his interpretation."
13:11;13:14;"We can listen to some more. Kelsey really cuddly. He's got some cool ad-libs."
13:14;13:20;"""But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."""
13:20;13:22;"""They're callin' again."""
13:22;13:23;"The Patience."
13:23;13:25;"""Scrambled eggs all over my face."""
13:25;13:26;"I bet that was a Kelsey ad-lib."
13:26;13:29;"""What is a boy to do?"""
13:29;13:31;"""Goodnight everybody!"""
13:31;13:32;"Wow."
13:32;13:35;"I remember famously a hard-to-place accent."
13:35;13:39;"People often were confused by Frazier because Frazier and Niles,"
13:39;13:41;"they kind of seemed like they were British or something."
13:41;13:43;"There was something off about it."
13:43;13:45;"It's like Robin Williams a little."
13:45;13:52;"I thought they were doing like really generic, upper-crust, erudite, rich guy voice."
13:52;13:54;"Like, ""Oh, I went to Harvard."""
13:54;13:59;"You know, it's like the Dan Aykroyd character in Trading Places."
13:59;14:01;"Oh, it is very similar to that."
14:01;14:04;"It's like that sort of like, ""Come here, Valentine."""
14:04;14:06;"One percent accent."
14:06;14:08;"That's a great movie, Trading Places."
14:08;14:09;"Great film."
14:57;14:59;"Tell them how you feel, Kitty."
14:59;15:00;"Kitty Lockhart."
15:41;15:44;"Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Lindelof."
16:52;16:57;"Nick just reminded me here in the room that a similar thing happened to me in Vampire Weekend."
16:57;16:58;"I kind of forgot about this."
16:58;17:08;"I remember many, many years ago, we got an email that said, ""There's a new show coming out on NBC called Parks and Recreation."""
17:08;17:15;"And they currently have their opening credits mocked up to a Vampire Weekend song called ""M79."""
17:15;17:17;"""It's gonna take a little time."""
17:17;17:18;"Exactly."
17:18;17:20;"""Little time to think this over."""
17:20;17:21;"Wait, what?"
17:21;17:22;"That is kind of the reference."
17:22;17:25;"So they had it mocked up to ""M79,"" which was fairly new at the time."
17:25;17:31;"Actually, I remember I wrote the initial ""da-da-da-da"" was in that house in Brooklyn when I used to live with your brother Dave."
17:31;17:35;"There was like this really horrible piano in there, and I remember I wrote ""da-da-da-da."""
17:35;17:37;"So anyway, this is the Vampire Weekend song."
17:49;17:51;"This is fresh air."
17:51;17:52;"Very fresh."
17:52;17:54;"I've heard this song so many times in fresh air."
17:54;17:55;"Oh, really?"
17:55;17:56;"Yeah."
17:56;18:04;"On the next episode of Fresh Air, John Lee Hancock, director of The Founders, is on."
18:04;18:08;"So anyway, that song's a stone cold classic."
18:08;18:09;"I don't think I need to remind people."
18:09;18:11;"That's like a top five vampire song for me."
18:11;18:12;"Oh, really?"
18:12;18:13;"Yeah, top five."
18:13;18:18;"I think it's considered kind of a, not a random one, but it's not like, well, I don't know."
18:18;18:21;"It wasn't like a hit, but it's like, heads no."
18:21;18:22;"It's top ten for me."
18:22;18:24;"Heads no, M79."
18:24;18:25;"Top 20."
18:25;18:28;"So anyway, we get this email."
18:28;18:33;"It probably wasn't even intended for us, because sometimes music supervisors put out these big blasts."
18:33;18:36;"They're just looking for anybody, so it kind of came to our manager or something."
18:36;18:41;"So we mocked it up to this Vampire Weekend song, and we want something that kind of has a similar flavor or something."
18:41;18:45;"And we were like, maybe they should just ask to use our song."
18:45;18:46;"Maybe that'd be cool."
18:46;18:47;"Right."
18:47;18:51;"I think in the end, we submitted something, which they didn't choose."
18:51;18:52;"Instrumental?"
18:52;18:53;"It must have been instrumental."
18:53;18:54;"Yeah, they were looking for something instrumental."
18:54;18:55;"Right."
18:55;18:56;"But so--"
18:56;18:57;"What did they end up using?"
18:57;19:00;"This is what they ended up using, and you can tell it's clearly indebted to the--"
19:00;19:04;"So just remember, M79 goes, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
19:04;19:05;"And this is what they ended up using."
19:09;19:11;"[VOCALIZING]"
19:11;19:12;"OK."
19:12;19:15;"[VOCALIZING]"
19:15;19:16;"Interesting."
19:16;19:17;"They ripped you off wholesale."
19:27;19:28;"Da, da, da, da."
19:28;19:29;"Yeah."
19:33;19:36;"Well, so anyway, this is what happens in society."
19:36;19:38;"People want one thing, and then they--"
19:38;19:39;"They can't afford it."
19:39;19:40;"Yeah."
19:40;19:41;"Or they just want to do their own thing."
19:41;19:42;"I'm not mad at it."
19:42;19:43;"Yeah, it's fine."
19:43;19:46;"I don't think you should be able to copyright a vague rhythm or palette."
19:46;19:47;"Yeah."
19:47;19:48;"But anyway, that is the story."
19:48;19:51;"There's a little vampire-like inspiration behind the Parks and Rec theme song."
19:51;19:54;"And now we know there's a little Joni Mitchell behind the--"
19:54;19:55;"[LAUGHS]"
19:55;20:00;"I wonder who the Joni Mitchell head was on the Frasier team, like one of the main producers--"
20:00;20:01;"Yeah, maybe it was one of the creators."
20:01;20:02;"I mean--"
20:02;20:03;"Maybe Kelsey was a big Joni head."
20:03;20:08;"That makes a lot more sense in a way, because there's only so many songs about psychiatrists."
20:08;20:09;"Right."
20:09;20:10;"Can I point out one thing?"
20:10;20:11;"Yes."
20:11;20:13;"Toss salads and scrambled eggs."
20:13;20:17;"Isn't salad a-- what is it, a collective noun?"
20:17;20:19;"Like, why is it salads?"
20:19;20:21;"Isn't it always just salad?"
20:21;20:24;"That's an interesting question, Seinfeld2000."
20:24;20:25;"No, no."
20:25;20:26;"Well, here's the thing."
20:26;20:27;"Okay."
20:27;20:28;"A salad is one thing."
20:28;20:29;"Sure."
20:29;20:34;"If you hand somebody a tossed salad, even though there's a lot of different pieces of arugula"
20:34;20:37;"and olives or whatever in there, you're handing them one salad."
20:37;20:38;"Yep."
20:38;20:45;"However, if, say, I'm a caterer at a Washington, D.C., fancy dinner, and we're coming out with"
20:45;20:50;"our first course, I'm coming out with seven tossed salads for the table."
20:50;20:51;"You know what I'm saying?"
20:51;20:52;"Yep."
20:52;20:54;"I got a tossed salad for Kellyanne."
20:54;20:55;"That's interesting."
20:55;20:57;"I got a tossed salad for Steve Bannon, right?"
20:57;20:58;"Yep."
20:58;20:59;"I got a Cobb salad--"
20:59;21:01;"Cobb salad and scrambled eggs."
21:01;21:02;"--for Sean Spicer."
21:02;21:04;"He doesn't like the other kind of salad."
22:19;22:24;"So pivoting away, I want to talk more about TV shows and jazz, but I think we'll save"
22:24;22:25;"that for the next episode."
22:25;22:30;"With the more pressing matters at hand, obviously the world is a disaster, we're going to try"
22:30;22:33;"to make Time Crisis a relatively safe space."
22:33;22:38;"One interesting thing that I read recently was that Trump, the bad man who's now president,"
22:38;22:42;"a lot of people thought he wasn't going to like staying at the White House because he's"
22:42;22:46;"known as to be this real scumbag rich dude homebody."
22:46;22:49;"He likes to stay in his golden apartment."
22:49;22:52;"Plus, his son, Barron, is still in school in New York."
22:52;22:57;"It turns out his first week down in DC, he stayed at the White House the whole time."
22:57;23:02;"So there's this New York Times article, the title is ""A Homebody Finds the Ultimate Home"
23:02;23:05;"Office"" by Maggie Haberman."
23:05;23:11;"Isn't it funny how even as he's doing these absurd, immoral executive orders and stuff,"
23:11;23:16;"they still have to also write about, ""Well, how's he finding the house?"""
23:16;23:17;"Yeah, a lifestyle piece."
23:17;23:20;"It's definitely not a puff piece, but whatever."
23:20;23:22;"He does like his midnight snacks."
23:22;23:23;"Yeah, exactly."
23:23;23:29;"So there's so many amazing quotes about this horrendous bad person."
23:29;23:32;"It says, ""His aide said privately that he seemed apprehensive about the move to his"
23:32;23:33;"new home."""
23:33;23:34;"It sounds like you're talking about a 10-year-old."
23:34;23:35;"This is a 70-year-old man."
23:35;23:38;"I don't know if I'm going to like it."
23:38;23:40;"""But Mr. Trump has discovered there's a lot he likes."
23:40;23:44;"'These are the most beautiful phones I've ever used in my life,' Mr. Trump said in a"
23:44;23:46;"telephone interview Tuesday evening."
23:46;23:49;"'The world's most secure system,' he added, laughing."
23:49;23:51;"'The words just explode in the air.'"
23:51;23:54;"What he meant was that no one was listening and recording his words."""
23:54;23:55;"So also, just picture this."
23:55;23:57;"This is how the world works."
23:57;24:01;"There's a new president out here ruining people's lives, and he's getting on the phone"
24:01;24:04;"with the New York Times just to chat about how he likes his new house."
24:04;24:08;"And one of the first things he says to this New York Times reporter is, ""These are the"
24:08;24:11;"most beautiful phones I've ever used in my life."""
24:11;24:15;"He must just be like, ""Uh, okay, sir."""
24:15;24:16;"I mean, I kind of like this because--"
24:16;24:17;"Let's talk about the phones."
24:17;24:19;"I mean, what's the deal with the phones?"
24:19;24:21;"I think he just meant that nobody's listening."
24:21;24:24;"Is he so paranoid he thinks people are listening to him all the time?"
24:24;24:26;"I think it's like an old phone, or it's like a--"
24:26;24:28;"Maybe he's just talking about he likes that it's a secure system."
24:28;24:30;"It's a landline."
24:30;24:31;"You think it's cordless?"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah, I wonder what kind of actual phone they have in the White House."
24:33;24:38;"I like this because on Time Crisis we like to talk about routines, what people do."
24:38;24:41;"""His mornings, he said, are spent just as they were in Trump Tower."
24:41;24:46;"He rises before 6 a.m., watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence."""
24:46;24:50;"As many people have pointed out, sometimes when he gets these absurd tweets off, you"
24:50;24:53;"can literally trace it to the thing he saw on Fox News that set him off."
24:53;24:54;"Right, right."
24:54;24:58;"""He rises before 6 a.m., watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence"
24:58;25:02;"and later in a small dining room in the West Wing and looks through the morning newspapers,"
25:02;25:05;"the New York Times, the New York Post, and now the Washington Post."""
25:05;25:14;"I like that character trait of this dipsh that he wakes up, turns the TV on in the bedroom,"
25:14;25:17;"and then shuttles over to breakfast in the West Wing."
25:17;25:18;"More TV."
25:18;25:20;"Turns the TV back on."
25:20;25:25;"That's like some real '90s middle class people started having a little TV in the kitchen."
25:25;25:26;"Right."
25:26;25:31;"It was kind of setting us up for this horrendous internet everywhere nonstop thing where you"
25:31;25:34;"wake up and throw on the TV in the bedroom."
25:34;25:37;"Then you go and start making breakfast, throwing the little TV."
25:37;25:38;"Brutal."
25:38;25:41;"So anyway, in this arc, he keeps talking about, he told the reporter, there's a lot of board"
25:41;25:46;"rooms in the White House and he's been enjoying showing people around the White House."
25:46;25:49;"But this is the reason that I bring it up."
25:49;25:53;"""His first breakfast at the White House was Saturday morning, the day after the inauguration."
25:53;25:58;"A buffet in the residence spread with fresh fruit, pastries, and other treats where his"
25:58;26:01;"adult children and their families joined him."""
26:01;26:07;"One of the funniest phrases in the English language is adult children."
26:07;26:14;"Also, I'm so curious, just about how does information, that's a big theme of the moment"
26:14;26:16;"is, how does information flow?"
26:16;26:17;"Where do these things come from?"
26:17;26:23;"Did this reporter, Maggie Haberman, have some other info that told her that there was a"
26:23;26:24;"buffet for breakfast?"
26:24;26:30;"Or did Trump literally say to her, ""The first breakfast was a wonderful buffet."
26:30;26:34;"We had fresh fruit, pastries, and other treats."""
26:34;26:36;"Because it's so detailed."
26:36;26:38;"So anyway, he had that breakfast."
26:38;26:42;"And I guess already on Saturday, this is a quote from the New York Times, ""The kitchen"
26:42;26:50;"has been stocked with the same types of snacks that Mr. Trump had on his private plane, including"
26:50;26:52;"Lay's potato chips."""
26:52;26:53;"Boom."
26:54;26:55;"Okay."
26:55;26:56;"So there's a lot to unpack there."
26:56;26:58;"You think there were Lay's in the Obama White House?"
26:58;26:59;"Yeah, if he wanted them."
26:59;27:05;"I mean, it's reasonable to imagine that the White House would have some kind of storeroom"
27:05;27:07;"that would have- An assortment of snacks."
27:07;27:09;"An assortment, including the number one snack chip in the country."
27:09;27:10;"Yeah."
27:10;27:13;"But there's something about the way this was written that really made it seem like Trump"
27:13;27:14;"needs his Lay's."
27:14;27:15;"Specific."
27:15;27:16;"Because that's the thing about him, right?"
27:16;27:18;"He just eats junk food."
27:18;27:20;"I think he's wilds out on KFC and junk food."
27:20;27:25;"We've always tiptoed around on this show, do we support Lay's or do we not?"
27:25;27:30;"I got to say, after reading that, I don't have a hankering for any Lay's."
27:30;27:32;"Those are Trump chips."
29:17;29:22;"We'll have to unpack more of the snack chips and heads of state stuff later,"
29:22;29:25;"because we have a great guest coming up."
29:25;29:27;"His name is Bart Elmore."
29:27;29:31;"He's assistant professor of environmental history at the Ohio State University."
29:31;29:33;"And he just came out with a book called Citizen Coke,"
29:33;29:36;"The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism."
29:36;29:37;"I love the alliteration."
29:37;29:40;"First of all, Citizen Coke, the making of Coca-Cola capitalism."
29:40;29:42;"Just to tell you about the book."
29:42;29:46;"In this new history, Barto J. Elmore explores Coke through its ingredients,"
29:46;29:49;"showing how the company secured massive quantities of coca leaf,"
29:49;29:51;"caffeine, sugar, and other inputs."
29:51;29:53;"Its growth was driven by shrewd leaders such as Asa Candler,"
29:53;29:57;"who scaled an Atlanta soda fountain operation into a national empire."
29:57;29:59;"And boss Robert Woodruff,"
29:59;30:03;"who nurtured partnerships with companies like Hershey and Monsanto."
30:03;30:06;"These men and the company they helped build were seen as responsible citizens,"
30:06;30:08;"bringing jobs and development to every corner of the globe."
30:08;30:13;"But as Elmore shows, Coke was usually getting the sweet end of the deal."
30:13;30:16;"One of the biggest companies in the world."
30:16;30:20;"We haven't talked too much about beverages on Time Crisis."
30:20;30:21;"We've gone deep on Pepsi."
30:21;30:24;"Oh, right. Yeah, maybe it's just Pepsi sucked it up."
30:24;30:25;"We never really talked about Coke."
30:25;30:29;"My gut instinct is that because Coke tastes better than Pepsi,"
30:29;30:33;"it's probably also a more moral company than Pepsi."
30:33;30:35;"Because we found out some crazy stuff,"
30:35;30:41;"like Pepsi was overthrowing regimes in Latin America."
30:41;30:43;"Yeah, assisting."
30:43;30:44;"Assisting, at the very least."
30:44;30:46;"Yeah, lobbying for, let's put it that way."
30:46;30:49;"Let's talk to Bart Elmore and find out a little more about Coke."
30:49;30:53;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
30:53;30:57;"[phone ringing]"
30:57;30:58;"Hello, Bart?"
30:58;30:59;"Yes, hello."
30:59;31:01;"Hey, how are you doing, man? Welcome to Time Crisis."
31:01;31:04;"Thanks so much for having me. It's exciting to be here."
31:04;31:05;"Our pleasure."
31:05;31:07;"So we recently heard about your book."
31:07;31:09;"The title alone caught our eyes."
31:09;31:12;"Citizen Coke, the making of Coca-Cola capitalism."
31:12;31:15;"So it sounds like in this book you're kind of talking about"
31:15;31:18;"the global business practices of Coca-Cola."
31:18;31:19;"Right, yeah."
31:19;31:21;"But we want to start off things on a light note."
31:21;31:23;"What's your favorite type of Coke?"
31:23;31:25;"I drink a lot of Coke."
31:25;31:28;"I got to say, I started off growing up in Atlanta,"
31:28;31:30;"so I was surrounded by this drink."
31:30;31:34;"And I would have to say Coca-Cola Classic, the real thing."
31:34;31:35;"Oh, so you're from Atlanta."
31:35;31:38;"So I got to--is Atlanta--you know how, like, in Detroit,"
31:38;31:42;"you're not allowed to drive, like, a Japanese car?"
31:42;31:44;"Because so many people are employed by the automotive industry."
31:44;31:45;"Right."
31:45;31:47;"In Atlanta, is it hard to find Pepsi?"
31:47;31:51;"Yeah, I mean, if you even ask for something other than a Coke,"
31:51;31:53;"the people will still be like, ""Oh, so you want a Coke,"" right?"
31:53;31:56;"It's kind of like universally when you want a soft drink,"
31:56;31:58;"you order a Coke in Atlanta."
31:58;31:59;"So, yeah, I grew up drinking it."
31:59;32:01;"I stopped drinking it in 2012."
32:01;32:02;"I'm a recovering addict."
32:02;32:05;"Actually, in the industry, they call me a heavy user."
32:05;32:06;"That's the term."
32:06;32:07;"A former heavy user?"
32:07;32:08;"A former heavy user."
32:08;32:10;"So you're saying within the soft drink industry,"
32:10;32:13;"they use the term ""user"" as opposed to ""consumer""?"
32:13;32:16;"Yeah, it's like we're kind of treated like addicts."
32:16;32:20;"Based on all your studies, is it fair to say that part of Coke's objective"
32:20;32:23;"was to get people to, like, treat Coke like water?"
32:23;32:26;"Yeah, it had to be taught that way."
32:26;32:28;"You know, you think about when you go back to the early advertisements,"
32:28;32:32;"the idea that you'd even drink it, like, in winter,"
32:32;32:33;"which seems so, like, silly, right?"
32:33;32:35;"But if you go back to the early advertisers, like,"
32:35;32:38;"you know, it's a great thing around Christmas time."
32:38;32:40;"Like, you might want to try this."
32:40;32:43;"They had to kind of tell people, ""This isn't just like a summer treat."
32:43;32:46;"This is something we want you to be consuming, like, you know,"
32:46;32:48;"at Christmas and fall, Thanksgiving."
32:48;32:50;"You know, it's good for all occasions."""
32:50;32:52;"Right, I've always been impressed by that."
32:52;32:55;"It truly makes no sense, but Coke owns Christmas."
32:55;32:59;"The idea that Christmas time is cold in most of the country."
32:59;33:01;"I think that red logo really helps."
33:01;33:04;"Right, and the idea that polar bears would--"
33:04;33:05;"Love Coke."
33:05;33:07;"--would want to drink an ice-cold Coke."
33:07;33:10;"Yeah, they need something to cool them off, you know?"
33:10;33:11;"It makes total sense."
33:11;33:13;"Now, what's really funny about that, too,"
33:13;33:15;"is when they came out with that polar bear campaign,"
33:15;33:18;"in part it was designed to say, you know,"
33:18;33:20;"we're conscious about this climate change stuff"
33:20;33:22;"for a more sustainable business."
33:22;33:25;"And so they put these polar bears on the--"
33:25;33:27;"I think it was on the Diet Coke cans."
33:27;33:29;"Or no, it was just on the regular cans."
33:29;33:30;"And that's the problem."
33:30;33:34;"It actually looked too much like the Diet Coke cans"
33:34;33:36;"because it had more kind of like white features on it."
33:36;33:39;"The way it looked, people were getting confused, apparently."
33:39;33:42;"So apparently they had to stop marketing them,"
33:42;33:43;"which is so funny."
33:43;33:46;"Like, they create these cans that supposedly are supposed to raise,"
33:46;33:49;"like, awareness about the polar bears and these issues."
33:49;33:52;"And yet, like, because they had to change over their production line"
33:52;33:54;"and had to get rid of all these cans,"
33:54;33:58;"ultimately it was, like, a terrible environmental decision on the end."
33:58;34:00;"That's one of the main questions I want to ask you"
34:00;34:03;"is because Jake and I were just talking before."
34:03;34:07;"As Americans, we're relatively conditioned to believe"
34:07;34:09;"that Coke tastes better than Pepsi."
34:09;34:12;"And we've, on this show, researched a little bit about Pepsi"
34:12;34:14;"and found that they're not going to shy away"
34:14;34:16;"from some Latin American regime change."
34:16;34:19;"And we kind of figured, well, obviously Pepsi does some bad things"
34:19;34:20;"and doesn't taste so great."
34:20;34:23;"But Coke tastes pretty good, and it's kind of, like, all-American."
34:23;34:27;"But it seems like in your book you found out that Coke is not great for the world"
34:27;34:29;"and especially the environment."
34:29;34:32;"Can you give us a few examples of how Coke does bad things?"
34:32;34:34;"Yeah, and Ezra, I would actually back up and just say, like,"
34:34;34:37;"we think of it as the quintessential American drink,"
34:37;34:38;"but, like, nothing in it's American."
34:38;34:40;"What do you mean, ""nothing in it's American""?"
34:40;34:42;"So think about what goes into this thing, okay?"
34:42;34:45;"So first of all, like, Coca-Cola."
34:45;34:46;"So the coca leaf."
34:46;34:47;"This is totally crazy."
34:47;34:51;"People do not know this, but yes, they did take out the alkaloid"
34:51;34:54;"that's in cocaine around 1903."
34:54;34:57;"So the drink would have had minuscule quantities of that."
34:57;35:00;"But the company still, into the 21st century,"
35:00;35:03;"is the largest importer of coca leaves in the United States."
35:03;35:08;"They have a process that they go through with a company in New Jersey"
35:08;35:10;"where they process out the cocaine."
35:10;35:13;"If you gave that to a drug dealer, they could turn that into a bag of Coke?"
35:13;35:17;"It's the same coca leaves that could be processed into the narcotic, yeah."
35:17;35:20;"That's legal? You're allowed to bring coca leaves into America?"
35:20;35:21;"You and I can't."
35:21;35:22;"Only that company, right?"
35:22;35:23;"Exactly."
35:23;35:25;"What we know is, like, okay, yeah, they took out the cocaine,"
35:25;35:29;"but what we don't know is that they got a special exemption"
35:29;35:34;"under our federal narcotics laws to bring in the leaves"
35:34;35:38;"as long as they processed out the cocaine through this intermediary,"
35:38;35:41;"which the company's now called Stepin."
35:41;35:42;"And this is how Coke works, right?"
35:42;35:44;"It always wants to work at arm's length"
35:44;35:47;"because Stepin is the company that's bringing this stuff in."
35:47;35:49;"So that's one of the great things about it."
35:49;35:51;"Like, people don't ask, okay, well, what is this company doing?"
35:51;35:52;"Is it related to Coke?"
35:52;35:54;"People don't know that, but that's the story."
35:54;35:56;"And these documents are amazing."
35:56;35:57;"They're at the National Archives."
35:57;36:00;"They document the secret trade that went on for decades"
36:00;36:02;"and continued on into the 21st century."
36:02;36:04;"I just want to fully understand the special exemption."
36:04;36:05;"Yeah."
36:05;36:08;"Is Coca-Cola/this weird intermediary Stepin"
36:08;36:13;"the only company in America that's allowed to bring coca leaves in?"
36:13;36:16;"The answer is essentially yes."
36:16;36:22;"So the way the law works is it says everything is basically not allowed"
36:22;36:24;"in terms of coca leaves being brought in,"
36:24;36:28;"except for--and there's this clause in our laws that says,"
36:28;36:32;"""Decoconized coca leaf extract."""
36:32;36:33;"And you're like, what the hell is that?"
36:33;36:35;"And actually, legislators at the time were like,"
36:35;36:36;"well, what the hell is that?"
36:36;36:40;"And it turns out it's the coca leaf with the cocaine removed"
36:40;36:43;"that is what's known as merchandise number five."
36:43;36:46;"It's the fifth secret ingredient in Coca-Cola."
36:46;36:49;"And Coke had a lobby for this thing back in the 19-teens,"
36:49;36:52;"and it remained in our laws through the 20th century"
36:52;36:53;"into the 21st century."
36:53;36:54;"It's crazy."
36:54;36:59;"So basically, it's the coca leaf essence without the cocaine."
36:59;37:01;"It's one of the flavors that makes it so unique."
37:01;37:04;"So if me and some buddies just dig a minivan out to Jersey,"
37:04;37:07;"we're probably going to find a dumpster just full of good Coke."
37:07;37:09;"So they get two types of leaves."
37:09;37:13;"One are called medicinal leaves, which they can process out the cocaine"
37:13;37:18;"and sell to legitimate hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to use."
37:18;37:22;"The other leaves are known under the law as special leaves."
37:22;37:26;"These are my favorite because these are more leaves than we need"
37:26;37:30;"to actually use for legitimate hospital uses and things like that."
37:30;37:31;"And you're right."
37:31;37:34;"That cocaine that was produced as a result of that had to be burned"
37:34;37:37;"under federal supervision, and there was an inspector that was supposed"
37:37;37:38;"to sit there and watch it."
37:38;37:43;"Coke is still--at least one element of it is still a byproduct of the coca leaf."
37:43;37:47;"Is that why Coke is so much better than Pepsi?"
37:47;37:49;"You know, Coke might think so."
37:49;37:50;"So let me just say this."
37:50;37:53;"To your point, did other companies want this stuff?"
37:53;37:54;"Absolutely."
37:54;37:57;"You can actually see records in the National Archives where companies"
37:57;38:03;"like Pepsi are saying, ""Yo, federal government, we want access to this stuff too."""
38:03;38:06;"And essentially the federal government says, ""Well, you're going to have to go"
38:06;38:08;"talk to that company, Stepan."""
38:08;38:09;"And Coca-Cola gets wind of this."
38:09;38:13;"Stepan writes to Coca-Cola, and you can imagine what Coke's response was."
38:13;38:14;"It was awesome."
38:14;38:17;"It was like, ""You do that, we drop the contract,"" which is kind of funny"
38:17;38:19;"because it's like, ""Well, who else is going to do this for him?"""
38:19;38:23;"So to understand this, part of the reason that Coke tastes good"
38:23;38:28;"is because there's a product, the same leaf that cocaine comes from,"
38:28;38:35;"that Coke essentially has the exclusive right over via this company, Stepan."
38:35;38:39;"The whole point of the book is that Coke doesn't do things."
38:39;38:42;"That's actually the thesis of the whole thing."
38:42;38:45;"Coke's strategy for making money was staying out of the business"
38:45;38:47;"of actually doing things."
38:47;38:51;"It's everybody else that actually owns and builds and makes stuff"
38:51;38:53;"that makes Coca-Cola possible."
38:53;38:54;"It's like the independent bottlers."
38:54;38:57;"The bottlers are the ones bottling the drink and putting the water"
38:57;38:58;"in the product."
38:58;39:00;"Most of those people were just independent franchises."
39:00;39:01;"They weren't owned by Coke."
39:01;39:03;"- Coke is a fascinating company."
39:03;39:05;"I got to say, thanks so much for talking to us, Bart."
39:05;39:06;"This is very elucidating."
39:06;39:10;"We'll have to have you on again to talk more about cocaine."
39:10;39:12;"I just want to point out one thing."
39:12;39:13;"So this is true."
39:13;39:14;"You came across this."
39:14;39:19;"In 2012, Coke sold more than 1.8 billion servings a day,"
39:19;39:21;"one for every four people on earth."
39:21;39:24;"So you're telling me the entire planet, every day,"
39:24;39:27;"one in four people drinks a Coke?"
39:27;39:29;"- It's a Coke product."
39:29;39:33;"- Okay, so you're including Sprite."
39:33;39:35;"- All their brands, yeah."
39:35;39:38;"And that's still crazy, like whether it's their bottled water or whether"
39:38;39:42;"it's vitamin water or whether you're drinking Powerade, Minute Maid,"
39:42;39:43;"orange juice in the morning."
39:43;39:46;"That's the thing that we didn't realize is like they have inserted themselves"
39:46;39:50;"in every beverage category that you can possibly imagine."
39:50;39:55;"- So every day, one in four human beings on planet earth drinks a Coke product."
39:55;39:56;"- You are surrounded by Coke."
39:56;40:01;"I'll tell you what, writing a book about a product that you see every single day"
40:01;40:04;"and reminding you that you need to write that next page,"
40:04;40:06;"it's a pain in the ass."
40:06;40:07;"- Right, you just can't escape it."
40:07;40:08;"- Because it's everywhere."
40:08;40:09;"You can't escape it."
40:09;40:11;"Like I'd go to the store and I'd be like, ""Damn, it's there too."
40:11;40:12;"I got to go back and write."""
40:12;40:14;"- One in four."
40:14;40:15;"- It's everywhere."
40:15;40:16;"- Thank you so much."
40:16;40:18;"Our guest has been Bart Elmore."
40:18;40:20;"So are you at Ohio State or Alabama?"
40:20;40:21;"- I'm at Ohio State now."
40:21;40:24;"I had to trade football loyalties."
40:24;40:26;"It's been a difficult journey."
40:26;40:27;"In Columbus, Ohio."
40:27;40:31;"- Bart Elmore, author of Citizen Coke, The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism."
40:31;40:32;"Thanks so much for calling in, Bart."
40:32;40:33;"We got to talk again."
40:33;40:34;"- Thanks a lot."
40:34;40:35;"- Have a good one, man."
40:35;40:36;"- I appreciate it, guys."
40:36;40:37;"- Bye."
40:37;40:38;"- You too."
40:38;40:39;"Bye-bye."

43:28;43:31;"- Well you know what the Intermediary Step Incorporation made me think of?"
43:31;43:32;"- What's that?"
43:32;43:34;"- The movie that we saw last night."
43:34;43:37;"[film reel]"
43:37;43:38;"- Oh, The Founder."
43:38;43:39;"- That's right."
43:39;43:44;"Jake made the great call that we should go see the film The Founder,"
43:44;43:48;"which is the story of Ray Kroc, the supposed founder of McDonald's."
43:48;43:50;"It's played by Michael Keaton."
43:50;43:51;"- Yep."
43:51;43:55;"- And it's kind of the story of how McDonald's grew from this small place"
43:55;43:58;"in San Bernardino, California run by the McDonald brothers."
43:58;44:00;"- Maurice and Dick."
44:00;44:02;"- Maurice. Forgot that."
44:02;44:08;"And how this guy from Illinois, Ray Kroc, kind of came across their burger stand"
44:08;44:11;"and kind of transformed into what it is today."
44:11;44:12;"- Yeah."
44:12;44:15;"- And he kind of did it partially by establishing an intermediary company"
44:15;44:19;"which was buying up all the real estate and forcing McDonald franchisees"
44:19;44:24;"to lease the real estate from them, increasing the profitability."
44:24;44:26;"- The Franchise Realty Corporation."
44:28;44:31;"- So first things first, did you enjoy watching this film?"
44:31;44:33;"- Yeah, I did."
44:33;44:34;"- Is it a good film?"
44:34;44:37;"- No, it's tonally muddled."
44:37;44:38;"It doesn't know what it wants to be."
44:38;44:40;"It's kind of two movies."
44:40;44:48;"On one hand, a sort of benign, glossy portrait of this successful businessman,"
44:48;44:51;"and then on the other hand, it's sort of like a dark, seedy underbelly"
44:51;44:54;"of ambition and greed."
44:54;44:56;"It's in an awkward middle ground."
44:56;44:59;"- It's a little bit unclear what the movie is saying about Ray Kroc."
44:59;45:01;"I mean, he definitely was not a great dude."
45:01;45:02;"- Yeah."
45:02;45:07;"- It reminded me a lot of The Social Network in that it kind of pits two brothers"
45:07;45:11;"who kind of get into a head-on collision with a scrappy outsider"
45:11;45:14;"who takes their idea and makes billions."
45:14;45:16;"- Right, right."
45:16;45:20;"- Zuckerberg is the Ray Kroc of our era."
45:20;45:26;"- You know, the famous quote in The Social Network from the Mark Zuckerberg character"
45:26;45:30;"is ""If you started Facebook, you would have started Facebook."""
45:30;45:31;"- Right."
45:31;45:36;"- Which is kind of reminiscent also, I think, of the Trump line, ""It's because I'm smart,"""
45:36;45:40;"which basically is this kind of like idiotic American concept that's kind of like"
45:40;45:43;"whoever got away with it owns it and is the smart one."
45:43;45:45;"And it's kind of similar to The Founder."
45:45;45:49;"It's like these two brothers, these kind of nice guys--"
45:49;45:52;"the movie at least makes it seem like these are these nice guys"
45:52;45:56;"who just want to run an efficient, tasty, family-friendly burger stand."
45:56;45:58;"- They had devised the Speedy system."
45:58;46:00;"- That's what separated McDonald's from the rest of the pack."
46:00;46:03;"- Right, which was their sort of response to Henry Ford."
46:03;46:07;"They looked at the automated factory production styles of making automobiles,"
46:07;46:09;"and they applied that to hamburger making."
46:09;46:12;"So they were passionate about the speed of their system,"
46:12;46:15;"and they were passionate about the quality of their food."
46:15;46:18;"And I think Ray Kroc was passionate about business."
46:18;46:21;"- Right. - And that's the fundamental conflict in the film."
46:21;46:24;"And so then Ray Kroc shows up, and he's like, ""This is amazing."
46:24;46:26;"We could easily replicate this."""
46:26;46:30;"And like every town has a church, and every town has a town square."
46:30;46:32;"- Right, that's a classic line in this film."
46:32;46:34;"- Every town could have a McDonald's."
46:34;46:37;"He sees it from the get-go, which is kind of interesting."
46:37;46:42;"- And he did it. He took their idea and turned it into a Coca-Cola-esque corporation."
46:42;46:46;"- I mean, yeah, the movie was flawed, but it still managed to convey"
46:46;46:49;"the sort of arc of his vision and career."
46:49;46:53;"I think in the beginning, he was genuinely passionate about"
46:53;46:56;"McDonald's being a family-friendly establishment."
46:56;47:01;"And I think he was genuinely passionate about being an American entrepreneur."
47:01;47:07;"I think he legitimately saw McDonald's as a way to improve the quality of life in the U.S."
47:07;47:10;"And then as the movie progresses, you see him sort of like--"
47:10;47:14;"that grand vision, that grand dream becomes curdled and corrupted by his will"
47:14;47:16;"for power and money."
47:16;47:18;"- That's a very classic journey."
47:18;47:21;"We have dreams when we're young."
47:21;47:26;"When you have a dream, if the dream involves being rich and famous,"
47:26;47:30;"but also maybe something positive, like making people happy or something,"
47:30;47:33;"when you're still dreaming it, it's all tied together,"
47:33;47:36;"so you don't actually have to parse out what's the most important part of your dream."
47:36;47:40;"So, you know, like in music or something, when you're young,"
47:40;47:42;"maybe you'll be like, ""Oh, wow, I want to be a rock star."
47:42;47:45;"I want to be a professional musician."""
47:45;47:50;"And I've had this conversation a lot with various entertainers or something,"
47:50;47:52;"because then eventually you get to this place where you're like--"
47:52;47:55;"when I would daydream about--I don't know who was cool when I was a kid."
47:55;47:57;"- Stone Temple Pilots. - Stone Temple Pilots."
47:57;48:00;"When I would daydream about--I wasn't much of a fan."
48:00;48:02;"Rest in peace, Scott Weiland, though."
48:02;48:06;"- But you were like, ""If I could only play bass in STP, my life would be cool."""
48:06;48:09;"- They're playing the MTV Music Awards in 1994."
48:09;48:12;"- When you're young and you have this dream, like what if I was in Stone Temple Pilots?"
48:12;48:14;"It's a simple dream. You're just in Stone Temple Pilots."
48:14;48:16;"You don't have to ask yourself these questions."
48:16;48:19;"Do I want to be in Stone Temple Pilots because I want to rock out on great tunes,"
48:19;48:22;"enjoy camaraderie with two to three other--"
48:22;48:24;"- Great guys. - Great guys."
48:24;48:28;"Is that the primary thing, or is it because I want to have that Scott Weiland money"
48:28;48:30;"and that Scott Weiland success?"
48:30;48:33;"- And that Scott Weiland respect. - Exactly."
48:33;48:37;"So you don't have to-- - You don't have to parse it out."
48:37;48:41;"- Exactly. You don't have to parse it out, and that's like the classic American dream thing."
48:41;48:43;"You don't have to parse it out until you get there."
48:43;48:48;"So Ray Kroc, like you said, it's very possible this guy sees this efficient little restaurant"
48:48;48:52;"and says, ""This is great because if we bring this to the rest of the country,"
48:52;48:55;"people can go to a restaurant and not have to worry about waiting forever."
48:55;48:58;"They can spend more time with their families, and we're going to make it clean."""
48:58;49:00;"- Family-friendly. - And we're going to make it consistent."
49:00;49:02;"- Affordable. - Right."
49:02;49:06;"If you're driving cross-country with your family, you don't have to pull into some place."
49:06;49:09;"I believe that maybe he truly believes he was bettering people's lives."
49:09;49:12;"And of course it's a business, so he expects some profit."
49:12;49:15;"But then you reach these moments where it's like, okay, you did something good."
49:15;49:17;"You are making people's lives better."
49:17;49:20;"The catch is you're not making as much money as you thought you were."
49:20;49:24;"You successfully franchised 100 restaurants, and yet you're still in debt."
49:24;49:26;"This is what happens in the movie. - Right."
49:26;49:28;"- This is not a spoiler, I don't think. - Right."
49:28;49:31;"- So then you reach this point where you're like, ""I've built a brand. That feels pretty good."
49:31;49:36;"I'm serving good, clean hamburgers to families, and yet I'm still not raking it in."""
49:36;49:40;"That's when people start realizing that they like money more than they thought,"
49:40;49:43;"and they start making decisions. - What matters in the end?"
49:43;49:46;"- And on that note, let's listen to some Stone Temple Pilots."
51:35;51:42;"- I feel like Starbucks is a good example."
51:42;51:45;"When I first went to a Starbucks when I was like 11 or 12,"
51:45;51:47;"they were doing a similar thing."
51:47;51:49;"Starbucks was kind of like supposed to be like,"
51:49;51:52;"""Hey, not everybody gets to live in Greenwich Village."""
51:52;51:54;"You know what I'm saying?"
51:54;51:58;"Like, yeah, we don't all get to live in Greenwich Village or San Francisco."
51:58;52:03;"We don't all have like three poetry slams down the block,"
52:03;52:07;"but you still deserve a place to go drink a cup of coffee"
52:07;52:10;"and read a book and not feel like a bum."
52:10;52:15;"You still deserve to go spend $3 to be in a place that you feel an air of culture."
52:15;52:17;"Frankly, I agree with that. - Yeah."
52:17;52:19;"- I've lived in cities. I've lived in suburbs."
52:19;52:23;"It's like I hate the monopoly on like, you know, on cool."
52:23;52:25;"Yeah, we're not all Frazier Crane."
52:25;52:27;"We're not all living in Seattle drinking fine coffee."
52:27;52:31;"But so I like the idea that like just because you live in a smaller town or something,"
52:31;52:35;"there's still like a coffee shop that has like decent coffee"
52:35;52:37;"and feels like culture."
52:37;52:39;"And I guess Starbucks was kind of providing that for--"
52:39;52:41;"I mean, it sounds really idiotic as I say it out loud,"
52:41;52:44;"but Starbucks was kind of like providing that in a way."
52:44;52:45;"Similar to Whole Foods now."
52:45;52:47;"When Starbucks would come to a town, it's kind of like--"
52:47;52:51;"I think there probably was a type of person who felt like, ""Finally a place for me."""
52:51;52:53;"But you know what I mean? Like that's not a crazy feeling."
52:53;52:57;"Like you live somewhere where maybe there's nowhere cool to hang out."
52:57;52:59;"You don't like going to the diner. - There's no culture."
52:59;53:02;"- There's no--yeah, or there's not the culture that you're looking for."
53:02;53:06;"You can't go to the diner anymore because Rusty gives you the stink eye."
53:06;53:08;"And now, finally, it's Starbucks."
53:08;53:10;"It's like a place you can just go have a cup of coffee. - Right, right."
53:10;53:13;"- And they don't have--you know, the lighting's decent."
53:13;53:16;"So maybe Starbucks did start out by providing some decent service."
53:16;53:20;"It's like, ""We're going to bring you good coffee that's made the right way"
53:20;53:21;"and give you a place to hang out."""
53:21;53:24;"But then, you know, then the growth was just insane."
53:24;53:27;"And the Starbucks just became dirtier."
53:27;53:29;"In my opinion, the coffee got worse."
53:29;53:32;"- Yeah, the coffee's undrinkable. - Disgusting."
53:32;53:36;"We're dissing a lot of beverages on this show."
53:36;53:37;"- Yeah. - But you know what I mean?"
53:37;53:40;"It's like at some point, I think we can all agree that Starbucks,"
53:40;53:44;"for all their fronting about social justice"
53:44;53:48;"and being a place where you can buy--"
53:48;53:51;"- Buy a brand-new Joni Mitchell CD. - But I don't know."
53:51;53:54;"Maybe Starbucks still does provide that for people."
53:54;53:56;"I don't know. It's complicated, man."
53:56;53:59;"You know, this is a wall we hit a lot on Time Crisis,"
53:59;54:02;"is this feeling of this is the world that we were born into."
54:02;54:06;"Are we supposed to want to end big corporate chains?"
54:06;54:09;"Or do we have to kind of find the humanity in them ourselves?"
54:09;54:10;"You know what I'm saying?"
54:10;54:13;"If I was spending time in a place that didn't have, like,"
54:13;54:16;"all these artisanal coffee shops and there's just a Starbucks,"
54:16;54:18;"and I was like, ""Hey, you want to go over to Starbucks"
54:18;54:20;"and just sit and have a coffee or something?"""
54:20;54:24;"And somebody got all like, ""Ugh, I don't want to go to Starbucks,"""
54:24;54:27;"I'd be like, ""Man, let's just experience a little bit of joy."
54:27;54:30;"You know it's going to be better than the gas station coffee."""
54:30;54:32;"- Lighten up. - Lighten up."
54:32;54:36;"Like, yeah, okay, it would be cool if every town"
54:36;54:40;"had a neighborhood independent coffee shop,"
54:40;54:42;"but this is the world we're living in, man."
54:42;54:44;"Can we just go to Starbucks and enjoy it?"
54:44;54:47;"It's not that bad. They got grapes. Can we just do that?"
54:47;54:49;"- Is that a bad attitude? - No."
54:49;54:51;"Where do you draw the line? I guess that's what I'm asking."
54:51;54:53;"- Carl's Jr. - [laughs]"
54:53;54:56;"You're listening to..."
54:56;54:59;"- Time Crisis. - On Beat One."

57:34;57:37;"- When was the last time you had McDonald's?"
57:37;57:38;"- Long time ago."
57:38;57:40;"I've had breakfast in the last few years."
57:40;57:42;"But a straight-up burger?"
57:42;57:43;"Long time."
57:43;57:45;"- I wonder what the McDonald's Corporation"
57:45;57:47;"calls you as a consumer."
57:47;57:49;"'Cause like, they probably have their heavy user."
57:49;57:50;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:50;57:51;"- He's like, ""We got our heavy user"
57:51;57:52;"two to three times a day."""
57:52;57:54;"- Very infrequent."
57:54;57:56;"- But then we have this infrequent guy."
57:56;57:58;"- Like, maybe spontaneous user?"
57:58;57:59;"- We got the spontaneous user--"
57:59;58:01;"- Spontaneous/desperate user?"
58:01;58:03;"- Who's doing breakfast at best."
58:03;58:05;"At best, we're selling this guy"
58:05;58:07;"an Egg McMuffin and a coffee."
58:07;58:10;"- He's doing like .7 breakfasts annually."
58:10;58:11;"- They're like--"
58:11;58:12;"- I'm not on their radar, dude."
58:12;58:13;"- How do we get--"
58:13;58:14;"- I'm doing like an airport,"
58:14;58:17;"like Boise, Idaho airport."
58:17;58:20;"- How do we get those breakfast numbers up?"
58:20;58:22;"But there probably is a type of consumer"
58:22;58:24;"who's like a breakfast-only McDonald's guy."
58:24;58:25;"I can totally imagine that."
58:25;58:26;"- Breakfast 24 hours, dude."
58:26;58:27;"They went there."
58:27;58:28;"Remember last year?"
58:28;58:30;"- Oh yeah, I guess that was probably a way to be like,"
58:30;58:33;"we got this type of consumer who's coming in"
58:33;58:34;"on the way to work."
58:34;58:36;"They like the coffee, they like the price,"
58:36;58:38;"and they like the hash browns."
58:38;58:39;"But for whatever reason,"
58:39;58:42;"they find lunch or dinner at McDonald's"
58:42;58:43;"to be uncouth."
58:43;58:46;"How do we get that guy to broaden his spectrum,"
58:46;58:47;"so to speak?"
58:47;58:49;"How do we get that guy to maybe occasionally"
58:49;58:52;"get a extra value meal?"
58:52;58:53;"Oh, you know, that's one thing I read"
58:53;58:55;"in an article about the Coke book,"
58:55;58:58;"I should ask Bart, but apparently Coke"
58:58;59:02;"was semi-responsible for the McDonald's supersize idea."
59:02;59:05;"Coke said to McDonald's in the '90s,"
59:05;59:07;"why don't you create some kind of special thing"
59:07;59:08;"that's only a little bit more"
59:08;59:11;"that just increases the volume?"
59:11;59:12;"- More fries, more Coke."
59:12;59:16;"God, that's buff."
59:16;59:18;"- I guess on the positive side,"
59:18;59:20;"one man in a very bad time that we're living in,"
59:20;59:22;"when we think about the supersize debacle,"
59:22;59:24;"one man, Morgan Spurlock,"
59:24;59:26;"he kind of gets credit for taking down"
59:26;59:28;"the supersize option."
59:28;59:29;"- That's a crazy documentary."
59:29;59:31;"- Yeah, that was wild when it came out."
59:31;59:33;"- He's like, can't get hard at the end?"
59:33;59:35;"Is that what happens?"
59:35;59:37;"- After 30 days of McDonald's,"
59:37;59:39;"he experienced erectile dysfunction."
59:39;59:40;"- That's bonkers."
59:40;59:41;"- Yeah, and then to take it all--"
59:41;59:43;"- That is just crazy."
59:43;59:45;"- Take it all the way back to the beginning."
59:45;59:46;"If McDonald's was about a place"
59:46;59:47;"that a family can get together,"
59:47;59:49;"know that the food is gonna be good quality,"
59:49;59:51;"know that it's not gonna take a long time,"
59:51;59:53;"and then you look at it today,"
59:53;59:56;"it's horrible that we can't trust these brands"
59:56;59:58;"that are such a big part of our life,"
59:58;01:00:02;"the basic solid of not creating dysfunction"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"in our sex lives."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"We can't even count on our government"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"and our favorite brands"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"to disrespect our marital duties."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"- My man."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"- That's brutal."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Obviously today was a bit of a respite"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"from the horrible things happening in the world,"
01:00:17;01:00:21;"but obviously we're off to a pretty brutal start"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"in terms of the new regime"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"and how they're taking even more power away"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"from the American consumer"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"in terms of lack of information"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"about what's happening in the environment,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"what's happening in our food."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"Like, think about that."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Yeah."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- I may be an extreme example"
01:00:36;01:00:40;"as a kind of musician man about town."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"I never cook."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"I'm grabbing a burrito on the go."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"- Are you?"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- Taco."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Okay."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"- I'm grabbing a taco on the go."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- Too many carbs with that burrito, bro."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- Yeah, too many carbs in the burrito."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"I'm post-matin'."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"I rely so much on my belief"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"that the food products out there surrounding me"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"are not gonna kill me."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And you know what, even if I did cook,"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"I'm still gonna be going,"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"buying food from strangers,"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"most of it at the supermarket."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Even if you go to the farmer's market,"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"it's not like you literally watch the person"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"pick the carrot out of the ground."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"So we rely so much on the trust"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"that there's a system in place"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"to make sure that these foods"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"don't stop us from fulfilling our marital duties."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"But even more, just kill us."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"We trust so much."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"Now we're losing even more of that trust."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Imagine that."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"You go to the grocery store,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"and I mean, this stuff happens."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"It used to happen more."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"You go to the grocery store,"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"you buy a can of progresso soup,"

01:01:34;01:01:36;"You go home, throw it on the stove,"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"you eat it."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"You should think that you're getting nourishment."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"What if you ate that"
01:01:40;01:01:43;"and there was something in it that killed you?"

01:55:55;01:55:59;"Just imagine, like, after a passionate night with a lover,"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"and you text them the next morning and be like,"
01:56:02;01:56:06;"""Babe, I've been thinking about you all morning."
01:56:06;01:56:09;"My bedsheets smell like you."""
01:56:09;01:56:10;"But maybe it's a cultural thing."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"Maybe in England they say ""bedsheets."""
01:56:11;01:56:12;"I bet they do."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Maybe."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"I don't know."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"I'm all about the charitable interpretations."
01:56:16;01:56:19;"Oh, man, I got this dog suitor coming over."
01:56:19;01:56:23;"They're going to stay at my place and watch after the dog."
01:56:23;01:56:26;"I got to change the bedsheets."
01:56:29;01:56:33;"Yeah, we don't say-- you say ""sheets"" in America."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"♪ Bedsheets smell like you ♪"
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Also, ""smell."""
01:56:36;01:56:40;"I just, like, just hate all those words."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"Nurse Anderson,"
01:56:42;01:56:46;"did you change Mrs. Napolitano's bedsheets today?"
01:56:46;01:56:51;"Well, Mrs. Napolitano said you did not change the bedsheets today."
01:56:51;01:56:54;"Yeah, it sounds institutional."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"Bedsheets."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Cultural differences."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Fascinating."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"Well, anyway, who can blame Ed Sheeran in times like these"
01:57:02;01:57:07;"for wanting to retreat into a world of sexuality?"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"It's very tempting."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"If you look at what's happening--"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"Escapist hedonism."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"Who wouldn't want to just stay"
01:57:13;01:57:18;"wrapped in bedsheets with their lover?"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Well, let's wrap it up."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Yeah."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"That was a great top five."
01:57:23;01:57:26;"Rest in peace, John Lennon."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"We spent a pleasant couple hours--"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"I wouldn't say avoiding the topics of the day,"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"but just talking about kind of tangential things."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Sure."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"We got to still keep learning about how America works,"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"how big corporations work,"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"how pop music works,"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"how films work,"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"how TV show theme songs work."
01:57:45;01:57:47;"We can't give up on this stuff."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"I'm not worried about it."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"What?"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"Us giving up on it."
01:57:50;01:57:51;"We won't give up."
01:57:51;01:57:55;"That was our first episode of the Trump era."
01:57:55;01:57:58;"I hope that everybody enjoyed these two hours."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"It's Sunday."
01:57:59;01:58:02;"This is a day you can take a couple hours to chill,"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"spend time talking with your friends,"
01:58:04;01:58:07;"researching corporate food history."
01:58:07;01:58:10;"Anyway, we'll be back in a couple weeks."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about."
01:58:12;01:58:15;"Thank you so much to our guest Bart Elmore"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"over there at Ohio State University."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"Check out his book Citizen Coke,"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism."
01:58:20;01:58:24;"Shout out to Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's."
01:58:24;01:58:28;"His autobiography is called Grinding It Out."
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Really?"
01:58:30;01:58:32;"Ray Kroc, Grinding It Out."
01:58:32;01:58:34;"Highly recommend it,"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"especially if you're trying to build a business."
01:58:36;01:58:40;"Grab a copy of Grinding It Out at your local library."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"All right, we'll see you guys in a while."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling"
01:58:44;01:58:47;"tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"Mercy."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"And maybe I seem a bit confused."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"Yeah, maybe."
01:58:52;01:58:54;"But I got your pegs."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"But I don't know what to do"
01:58:57;01:59:02;"with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
01:59:02;01:59:05;"They're calling again."
01:59:05;01:59:08;"Scrambled eggs all over my face."
01:59:08;01:59:11;"What is a boy to do?"
01:59:11;01:59:12;"Good night everybody!"
01:59:12;01:59:17;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
