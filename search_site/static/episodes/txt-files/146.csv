00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis back again. New music from Mick Jagger and Dave Grohl, plus some"
00:07;00:13;"kind of new music from Van Morrison and Eric Clapton. On this episode we discuss"
00:13;00:19;"what boomers really are, who is and is not. We also talk about granola, count"
00:19;00:28;"down the top five country hits of 1964 and today. This is Time Crisis with Ezra"
00:28;00:30;"Koenig."
01:16;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake? Good day to you. Good day to you sir."
01:25;01:29;"We were just talking about maybe doing the show in person sometime soon"
01:29;01:35;"hopefully. That'd be interesting. I for one am sick of hanging out on a laptop."
01:35;01:41;"Yeah, definitely getting a little old. I know some people like it because they"
01:41;01:45;"don't have to drive or you know schlep around town but. I was just saying I'm"
01:45;01:49;"willing to drive across town at rush hour to do the show in person. Yeah, you"
01:49;01:55;"used to have it pretty harsh. I mean you know like a 45-minute drive to hang out"
01:55;02:00;"with your friends and tape a radio show every two weeks. I don't know if that's"
02:00;02:07;"harsh. Yeah, I guess it depends who you are. I mean it's no surprise that well I"
02:07;02:10;"never know what with you Jake what you're gonna find super harsh but it's"
02:10;02:14;"it's one of those things that like some people really f***ing hate and I do think"
02:14;02:18;"it's a little bit of like a mental exercise. That seems like some family"
02:18;02:25;"feud sh*t. Top five things that stress you out. It's gonna be like traffic, in-laws or"
02:25;02:30;"some sh*t. Like yeah family. Waiting in line for brunch. Let me see waiting in line for"
02:30;02:36;"brunch. That stresses me out. Like you pull up to a restaurant you see that line"
02:36;02:40;"and you're just already like hell no. No way. But then you're like meeting someone"
02:40;02:45;"there then it turns into a whole thing. Right. Yeah waiting more than like 15"
02:45;02:50;"minutes for a restaurant. It's like my true pet peeve. Stuck in bumper-to-bumper"
02:50;02:55;"traffic in downtown LA trying to get over to Culver City to tape a show once"
02:55;03:00;"every 14 days. I can roll with that. If I did it every day it might get aggravating."
03:00;03:05;"Yeah right if you got like the tough commute. Maybe that's why most people are"
03:05;03:10;"like super hate traffic is because it's like you know old-school day-in"
03:10;03:16;"day-out trying to get to your job not at your desk by 9. The boss is gonna give"
03:16;03:22;"you like some grief. Oversleep. Then you know some idiot cuts you off. Why are"
03:22;03:26;"they doing work right now? Yeah that's gonna piss people off. But yeah I feel"
03:26;03:30;"like inherently traffic if you're kind of like alright this might take a while."
03:30;03:35;"It's almost like an aesthetic experience. Bumper-to-bumper Los Angeles traffic."
03:35;03:41;"Getting cross town to do your internet radio show. Deeply aesthetic. Checking out"
03:41;03:48;"that bumper sticker scene. Yep just listening to local live radio about the"
03:48;03:53;"traffic. I mean that's some real sh*t especially growing up in New Jersey."
03:53;03:57;"Going into the city which really wasn't very far although that's some of the"
03:57;04:03;"craziest traffic on earth is surrounding Manhattan and before phones before"
04:03;04:08;"there's any way to check and my dad was like you know doing serious commutes all"
04:08;04:14;"the time although he was often waking up you know super early with his job but I"
04:14;04:17;"have memories of kind of going into the city with him in the car and him like"
04:17;04:21;"listening to the AM radio and it was a bit of a thing like are you gonna take"
04:21;04:25;"the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland Tunnel? I was just gonna say what was your"
04:25;04:30;"tunnel? We lived kind of equidistant from both and if things are really crazy you"
04:30;04:33;"could take the George Washington Bridge but that would be a very extreme"
04:33;04:37;"situation or depend where you're going in Manhattan but it was the same like"
04:37;04:40;"you start driving you're like listening you're waiting for that like whatever"
04:40;04:44;"traffic on the 10s you know like hoping that you catch it they'll just be like"
04:44;04:48;"Holland Tunnel looking great and you just like that was the only way you"
04:48;04:53;"could do it. You're putting on 770 a.m. or the one I always remember was 1010"
04:53;04:58;"winds I don't do you remember that? Sure. 1010 winds was just like news traffic"
04:58;05:03;"and weather on the 10s. Traffic and weather on the 10s. Like every 10 minutes or something. And also 1010 winds was always like"
05:03;05:07;"real stressful with that like kind of classic what is it like a marimba going"
05:07;05:27;"ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. Actually Mac you pull that up see if they got the 1010 winds music. Yeah just, while Matt pulls that up you know I texted you guys saying I was listening to the new Tim McGraw record which is about LA in his title song LA there's the line I don't mind the traffic on the 405."
05:27;05:33;"Really? Yeah. In fact that's where I met a good friend of mine all gridlocked"
05:33;05:39;"stopped and stuck there killing time long way from home but that's alright. He also"
05:39;05:44;"can afford to see traffic through an aesthetic lens because he's not in it"
05:44;05:48;"regularly he's in traffic once every few weeks he's not doing a regular commute"
05:48;05:56;"like Joe Sixpack. And also he's in a Ferrari. This is 1010 winds. The cross"
05:56;05:59;"box is backed up all the way to Jerome Avenue. You can see the dramatic video at"
05:59;06:14;"1010winds.com. The station you know. The people you trust. John Montone 1010 winds. I'm Bridget Quinn. I'm Lee Harris. I'm Susan Richard. 1010 winds you give us 22 minutes we'll give you the world. I mean why is the music so"
06:14;06:18;"hardcore ding ding ding ding ding ding and that kind of like dark note comes in boom"
06:18;06:24;"ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. Like all they're telling you is how slammed the Holland"
06:24;06:29;"Tunnel is most of the time. Well it's funny we're like touching back into that"
06:29;06:34;"like drive time terrestrial radio aesthetic because a few episodes ago"
06:34;06:40;"Ezra was doing the Rush Limbaugh style live read for the San Diego area car"
06:40;06:45;"dealership. Oh yeah. When Rush Limbaugh died I this was very TC I thought when he"
06:45;06:50;"died I found this or I saw it somewhere there was a link a clip of him from 1974"
06:50;06:56;"when he was an FM radio DJ in Pittsburgh playing like rock hits he went under"
06:56;07:00;"the name Jeff Christie I think but anyway there was one clip of him"
07:00;07:05;"introducing the song Garden Party by Ricky Nelson which was a TC favorite."
07:05;07:10;"Yep. And he like sort of in a backhanded way was like this song by Ricky Nelson"
07:10;07:14;"who's sort of a hippie now. Oh yeah. And it was like wow like it was just like a"
07:14;07:18;"little foreshadowing like where Rush would go. Just kind of. But he was just doing"
07:18;07:24;"he was doing that like Rush voice but I just it was like so weird just to like"
07:24;07:28;"it was like the beginning like if someone made some like whack Rush Limbaugh"
07:28;07:32;"biopic like that'd be like the like kind of the beginning of like private parts"
07:32;07:36;"style where like he gets his first job in Pittsburgh and he's just like it's"
07:36;07:39;"all like the long hairs at the like rock station in Pittsburgh and then Rush is"
07:39;07:44;"like sort of obscuring his reactionary views. Anyway I'm going down a rabbit"
07:44;07:50;"hole here but Adam McKay presents Rush an eight part limited series. It opens"
07:50;07:55;"with that scene he's just like listening to the new Ricky Nelson. He's hanging out"
07:55;07:58;"with Yoko. I don't know about that."
07:58;08:04;"I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends."
08:04;08:10;"A chance to share old memories and play our songs again."
08:10;08:24;"When I got to the garden party they all knew my name. No one recognized me. I didn't look the same."
08:24;08:37;"But it's alright now. I learned my lesson well. You see you can't please everyone so you got to please yourself."
08:37;08:51;"People came from miles around. Everyone was there. Yoko brought a walrus. There was magic in the air."
08:51;09:03;"Over in the corner, much to my surprise, Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise."
09:03;09:17;"But it's alright now. I learned my lesson well. You see you can't please everyone so you got to please yourself."
09:17;09:22;"Yeah you know it's funny I watched the movie Talk Radio not that long ago."
09:22;09:25;"You guys ever see that Eric Boghossian from the 80s?"
09:25;09:25;"Oh yeah."
09:25;09:26;"Years ago."
09:26;09:33;"Oliver Stone film. It has these very long like kind of 40 minute scenes of this dude doing his radio show."
09:33;09:39;"And he's just like going through the callers and he's got these like crazy neo-nazi callers and people f***ing with him."
09:39;09:46;"And it's this like really tense day. Kind of based on a real Talk Radio host who was murdered in the 80s."
09:46;09:54;"But anyway you could picture a two-hour film about Rush Limbaugh in the early 70s in Pittsburgh."
09:54;09:59;"And like somehow he's just like doing the show and then he like throws on the Ricky Nelson."
09:59;10:03;"He's having these like conversations about like Watergate or some sh*t."
10:03;10:04;"Yeah."
10:04;10:06;"It could be like a black box theater play as well."
10:06;10:11;"Yeah almost like a play. Jesse Plemons is Rush Limbaugh."
10:11;10:15;"Alright Adam McKay presents Rush starring Jesse Plemons."
10:15;10:19;"Have you seen that Robert Altman film where Philip Baker Hall plays Nixon?"
10:19;10:25;"It's from 1984. He's the only one in the movie. It's basically a filmed play and he's just like"
10:25;10:29;"Philip Baker Hall is just Nixon ranting in his office for two hours."
10:29;10:30;"Wow."
10:30;10:36;"It's a tough watch but it's tight. Highly recommend. Can't remember the name of the movie. Easy to find."
10:36;10:37;"Interesting."
10:37;10:38;"Secret Honor."
10:38;10:39;"Yep. Secret Honor."
10:39;10:48;"Secret Honor. Anyway recently Mick Jagger released probably one of his best solo songs."
10:48;10:51;"Actually I'm really unfamiliar with Mick Jagger solo work."
10:51;10:56;"But he dropped a surprise song with Dave Grohl. Honestly not bad."
10:56;10:58;"It hit the TC thread of course."
10:58;11:03;"Apparently we're not going to be able to listen to the whole thing because it's only on YouTube. Is that correct?"
11:03;11:06;"Alright we might as well just let's just throw in the beginning just to give everybody a taste."
11:06;11:16;"And this is Grohl on guitar and drums."
11:16;11:16;"Uh huh."
11:30;11:33;"So yeah we can't listen to the whole thing. We gave everybody a taste."
11:33;11:35;"Jake what were your initial impressions?"
11:35;11:37;"Well the song's called Easy Sleazy."
11:37;11:39;"Yeah not totally sure why."
11:39;11:42;"My initial impressions were that the song rules."
11:42;11:45;"Whoa. Strong words."
11:45;11:50;"I like Mick Jagger and Dave Grohl's best work in the 21st century."
11:50;11:51;"Okay."
11:51;11:54;"I like it better than like most Foo Fighters songs."
11:54;11:55;"Damn."
11:55;11:58;"It's up there with like Bottom and Nirvana."
11:58;12:01;"[Laughter]"
12:01;12:03;"I'm kind of joking around."
12:03;12:07;"But I was like pleasantly surprised with the song. I like the change of the chorus."
12:07;12:12;"I mean it's kind of like a dumb kind of like vamping on a one chord kind of verse."
12:12;12:14;"And then like I like that change they go into."
12:14;12:15;"I was a little surprised."
12:15;12:17;"Again I don't love Grohl."
12:17;12:25;"I mean I would have honestly I would have loved to hear the song with Keith Richards playing guitar and Charlie Watts on drums."
12:25;12:27;"I think it would have been a sick stone song."
12:27;12:31;"And like they would have like made it a little more tasteful and subtle and mellow."
12:31;12:36;"I've always thought Grohl was a little lacking in tone, touch and lyricism."
12:36;12:37;"[Laughter]"
12:37;12:39;"Great drummer but the guitar player."
12:39;12:42;"I just like but anyway point is I was feeling it."
12:42;12:45;"He held it down and he helped him write the song."
12:45;12:47;"He knows his classic rock in and out."
12:47;12:49;"I think they both did a great job together on this tune."
12:49;12:51;"But I understand where you're coming from Jake."
12:51;12:57;"It would be so interesting to be if we could hear like you know the Exile era lineup."
12:57;13:02;"Yeah I mean we could go back to the Brian Jones era but I don't know if he would have that much to contribute."
13:02;13:04;"This feels like a 70s song."
13:04;13:08;"So you know if we had the Exile lineup there's like the dude who played sax."
13:08;13:09;"I mean it'd be sick."
13:09;13:15;"Yeah like that's a funny like weird experiment if like the Stones went back to some like weird basement."
13:15;13:21;"And like set up a tape machine and recorded like and they were just like committed to like we're not doing."
13:21;13:25;"We're not like loading our tapes onto like Pro Tools to edit later."
13:25;13:26;"Well."
13:26;13:28;"We're just like making a record on tape."
13:28;13:33;"Not with a high profile producer not like Rick Rubin just like we're making a record in 2021."
13:33;13:34;"This is Mick and Keith holding it down."
13:34;13:35;"Mick and Keith manning the boards."
13:35;13:36;"It'd just be interesting."
13:36;13:39;"And I don't think it would be a success necessarily but."
13:39;13:42;"Yeah I wonder if Mick thought about hitting Keith up for this."
13:42;13:44;"They probably don't talk."
13:44;13:46;"Unless they got a tour to plan."
13:46;13:47;"Biz."
13:47;13:50;"Do you think Keith Richards knows this song exists?"
13:50;13:52;"He's aware of it but has not heard it."
13:52;13:56;"Yeah I mean he's definitely not like going deep on the internet I wouldn't think."
13:56;14:04;"Although I could see him just like sitting at his mansion all the jewelry bandanas and sh*t just like with an iPad."
14:04;14:09;"Scrolling Apple News and I could see him see the headline just like the f*ck."
14:09;14:11;"Dave Grohl."
14:11;14:14;"Yeah I can actually see him hearing it checking it out."
14:14;14:25;"The interesting thing about it is like it's definitely not a bad song and shout out to Dave Grohl for like doing like appropriately Keith classic type chord voicings."
14:25;14:26;"Yeah."
14:26;14:32;"The strangest thing about this song or maybe the coolest thing however you want to look at it are the lyrics."
14:32;14:35;"Oh yeah especially the later verses."
14:35;14:40;"It's a very unusual feeling hearing Mick get into this zone."
14:40;14:53;"Maybe there's some like deep stone stuff I don't know but he's just like he and Keith are such great lyricists and their vibe it's always like you know using classic American metaphors to like tell a story."
14:53;15:03;"It's almost like he's uh it's not quite weird al but he's getting into this like just funny topical zone that's like just very un not particularly stonesy."
15:03;15:05;"So let's look at the lyrics for a second."
15:05;15:14;"We took it on the chin the numbers were so grim bossed around by pricks stiff and other upper lips pacing in the yard you're trying to take the Mick."
15:14;15:16;"Okay that's funny."
15:16;15:21;"Is this the first time Mick Jagger has ever said used the phrase take the Mick in a song?"
15:21;15:23;"Wait what does take the Mick mean?"
15:23;15:24;"It's like some English sh*t."
15:24;15:30;"It looks like they've never referenced it in the lyrics so this is the first instance of that expression."
15:30;15:32;"To tease or to kid."
15:32;15:34;"Okay so you're trying to take the Mick."
15:34;15:35;"Yeah like."
15:35;15:39;"So this is like it's like a double entendre like you're trying to like take on."
15:39;15:41;"It's like are you f*cking with me?"
15:41;15:42;"Are you kidding me?"
15:42;15:43;"F*cking with Mick."
15:43;15:44;"Yeah."
15:44;15:45;"Don't f*ck with Mick."
15:45;15:46;"Yeah."
15:46;15:47;"You're trying to take the Mick."
15:47;15:50;"I think people say that a lot in England so that's pretty deep that Mick Jagger's only singing now."
15:50;15:51;"You're trying to take the Mick."
15:51;15:53;"You must think I'm really thick."
15:53;15:55;"That just means dumb right?"
15:55;15:56;"Yeah."
15:56;15:57;"Wait did people say that in America?"
15:57;15:58;"That's only an English thing right?"
15:58;15:59;"To be thick?"
15:59;16:01;"No people say that here."
16:01;16:02;"So he's kind of thick."
16:02;16:04;"I mean people our age don't say it but like."
16:04;16:05;"Really old people?"
16:05;16:08;"Well it has a like a different connotation I think."
16:08;16:11;"When people talk about being thick when they spell it T-H-I-C-C."
16:11;16:12;"Yeah."
16:12;16:13;"Does that mean you're really dumb?"
16:13;16:14;"Yeah."
16:15;16:16;"That's a good one."
16:16;16:17;"Yeah."
16:18;16:19;"Looking at the graphs with the magnifying glass."
16:19;16:20;"Cancel all the tours."
16:20;16:21;"Football's fake applause."
16:21;16:22;"No more travel brochures."
16:22;16:23;"Virtual premieres."
16:23;16:26;"I've got nothing left to wear."
16:26;16:27;"Looking out from these prison walls."
16:27;16:30;"You gotta rob Peter if you're paying Paul."
16:30;16:31;"But it's easy."
16:31;16:32;"Easy."
16:32;16:33;"Everything's gonna get really freaky."
16:33;16:34;"All right."
16:34;16:35;"On the night."
16:35;16:37;"Soon it'll be a memory you're trying to remember to forget."
16:37;16:44;"The verses have that kind of like I don't know like office Christmas party song vibe."
16:44;16:46;"You know just like being topical."
16:46;16:51;"Just like everyone in accounting got together to write a song and they referenced all the"
16:51;16:53;"things that happened at the office that year."
16:53;16:54;"It's got that vibe."
16:54;16:58;"But he and Dave Grohl or whoever wrote the lyrics was just too talented because actually"
16:58;17:00;"the chorus is like very strong."
17:00;17:01;"They're too talented."
17:01;17:02;"What?"
17:02;17:03;"Yeah."
17:03;17:04;"No the chorus is strong."
17:04;17:07;"The chorus is like a real could easily be a late Rolling Stones song."
17:07;17:09;"Looking out from these prison walls."
17:09;17:11;"You gotta rob Peter if you're paying Paul."
17:11;17:12;"That's strong."
17:12;17:13;"But it's easy."
17:13;17:14;"Everything's gonna get really freaky."
17:14;17:15;"All right."
17:15;17:16;"On the night."
17:16;17:18;"Soon it'll be a memory you're trying to remember to forget."
17:18;17:20;"That's like some classic like Mick like fun with words."
17:20;17:22;"I love that last line."
17:22;17:24;"It's hard to remember to forget."
17:24;17:28;"He's like things are about like everyone's getting vaccinated."
17:28;17:31;"Soon COVID is gonna be in the rearview mirror."
17:31;17:32;"It's gonna get crazy."
17:32;17:34;"It's gonna get easy and sleazy."
17:34;17:36;"People are gonna party."
17:36;17:38;"Oh is that what the easy sleazy refers to?"
17:38;17:39;"That's how I interpret it."
17:39;17:40;"Oh yeah."
17:40;17:41;"Everyone's gonna get really freaky."
17:41;17:46;"Things like like by mid late summer things are just gonna be like ripping."
17:46;17:48;"Mick's been dying to party."
17:48;17:50;"How old is Mick right now?"
17:50;17:51;"78."
17:51;17:52;"That's my guess."
17:52;17:53;"I don't know."
17:53;17:54;"That's a good guess."
17:54;17:55;"You know what's funny?"
17:55;17:57;"I feel like all of the like big baby boomer rock stars."
17:57;17:59;"Maybe we've talked about this."
17:59;18:03;"We're actually born before the baby boom which starts in 1945."
18:03;18:07;"All the big baby boomers were born like basically during the war."
18:07;18:08;"He's 77."
18:08;18:09;"Wow."
18:09;18:11;"So what year was he born?"
18:11;18:12;"43."
18:12;18:13;"Exactly."
18:13;18:14;"He's born during World War II."
18:14;18:15;"Not a baby boomer."
18:15;18:16;"Right."
18:16;18:18;"It's not a baby boom if the war is still raging."
18:18;18:21;"All of those 60s rock stars guys were born before that."
18:21;18:22;"That's a great point."
18:22;18:29;"All of their fans were like five years younger than them and were born in like the late 40s or early 50s."
18:29;18:30;"Yeah."
18:30;18:31;"But they were all like a little bit older."
18:31;18:38;"You know how we talked about what was it Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush were all born within like three months of each other?"
18:38;18:39;"Right."
18:39;18:42;"That was some real freaky Illuminati type stuff."
18:42;18:44;"They were all born in 1943?"
18:44;18:46;"No, they're born later I think."
18:46;18:49;"I think they're born in like '46 or '47."
18:49;18:50;"I think they're baby boomers."
18:50;18:51;"'46."
18:51;18:52;"Oh, they're born in '46."
18:52;18:54;"Okay, so the presidents are all baby boomers."
18:54;18:56;"The rock stars are all…"
18:56;18:57;"Yes."
18:57;18:58;"Like weird war babies."
18:58;18:59;"War babies."
18:59;19:00;"Yeah, Jerry…"
19:00;19:02;"Like Neil Young, Jerry Garcia, Beatles."
19:02;19:04;"Jerry's 42 I think."
19:04;19:05;"The Stones."
19:05;19:07;"Like they're all born in the early 40s."
19:07;19:08;"It's real weird."
19:08;19:17;"I bet you could probably chart that somehow like sometimes with cultural movements, it's better to be born on either side of it or something."
19:17;19:21;"Yeah, Bob Dylan, I'm guessing also early 40s?"
19:21;19:22;"I think so, yeah."
19:22;19:23;"What year was Bob Dylan born?"
19:23;19:26;"I'm going to guess '43 or something."
19:26;19:27;"'41."
19:27;19:28;"Whoa."
19:28;19:29;"'41."
19:29;19:30;"It's such a cluster."
19:30;19:31;"So yeah, no."
19:31;19:35;"So it's like you have a captive audience of kids that are like five or six years younger than you."
19:35;19:38;"So you're like 22 and…"
19:38;19:46;"Back then you were 20, 2021, putting out your record and all the kids are like 14, 15."
19:46;19:49;"I think that that's pretty standard pop culture stuff."
19:49;19:51;"Like actors, it's sort of aspirational."
19:51;19:55;"You know, like watching Saved by the Bell or something."
19:55;20:00;"Usually it's like four or five years younger, those kids watching that."
20:00;20:01;"It's like it's…"
20:01;20:02;"Right."
20:02;20:03;"Or more."
20:03;20:05;"I'm just thinking of like something I would…"
20:05;20:08;"I don't know what that connection is, but you know, it's like you start thinking of like,"
20:08;20:14;"who are the people watching like shows or listening to music and like putting pictures of them in your locker or whatever you do."
20:14;20:17;"It's going to be just like three, four years younger."
20:17;20:18;"Yeah."
20:18;20:30;"Yeah, and it makes sense that whatever the people born between 40 and 45 are the type of people in terms of what really like coalesced in terms of like 60s counterculture."
20:30;20:34;"Kind of came of age in the 50s, probably found it pretty stiff."
20:34;20:39;"They all like read On the Road, Blew Their Mind, were into the folk revival."
20:39;20:41;"Then they're into the Beatles."
20:41;20:46;"It really is like all the… so many of these people, a lot of them reference like some of like the same stuff."
20:46;20:48;"There just wasn't that much stuff."
20:48;20:57;"So there was like 50s beatnik stuff was kind of known as like the more extreme counterculture or like jazz based counterculture stuff."
20:57;21:07;"And then you get early rock and roll, the blues, throw that together, a little bit of country and Western, folk revival, it all comes together."
21:07;21:10;"No wonder these people kind of like connected."
21:10;21:11;"I am obliged to say."
21:11;21:12;"And now it's 2021."
21:12;21:13;"Yep."
21:13;21:16;"And Mick has written Easy Sleazy."
21:16;21:18;"Now Mick has written Easy Sleazy."
21:18;21:21;"Did you notice he had a very pronounced English accent in this one?"
21:21;21:23;"Yeah, is he like doing like a punk thing?"
21:23;21:25;"Yeah, like almost like a Johnny Rotten."
21:25;21:27;"Yeah, he's getting back to some of that…"
21:27;21:29;"Stupid TikTok dance."
21:29;21:33;"Oh yeah, we didn't listen to it, but the second verse we got to go through."
21:33;21:36;"That's a pretty mask, but never take a chance."
21:36;21:38;"TikTok stupid dance."
21:38;21:39;"Took a samba class."
21:39;21:41;"Yeah, I landed on my ass."
21:41;21:42;"Trying to write a tune."
21:42;21:44;"You better hook me up to Zoom."
21:44;21:45;"See my poncy books."
21:45;21:47;"Teach myself to cook."
21:47;21:50;"Actually, we need another English number crunch."
21:50;21:52;"Is a ponce like a pretentious person?"
21:52;21:56;"Mick is reading Proust and James Joyce."
21:56;21:58;"Or he just sees them on the shelf."
21:58;21:59;"What?"
21:59;22:03;"It's a man living off another's earnings, especially a woman's."
22:03;22:05;"Synonym of pimp."
22:05;22:09;"Especially one hired as a bodyguard or director."
22:09;22:11;"I think that's a different meaning."
22:11;22:12;"Maybe look up poncy."
22:12;22:13;"Kept man."
22:13;22:15;"I think that's the primary."
22:15;22:19;"But you know what, when I just looked up poncy, one definition was pretentious or affected."
22:19;22:22;"So it's probably somehow interrelated."
22:22;22:26;"Mick driving the TikTok reference is pretty wild."
22:27;22:30;"Lies, tell me how to buy my dirt."
22:30;22:36;"Lies, lie and let the stuff you bought work."
22:36;22:42;"Lies, where's the sweet thing in my ear?"
22:42;22:48;"Lies, how do I get out of here?"
22:48;22:54;"Why, why am I on the floor?"
22:55;22:59;"Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies."
22:59;23:06;"Well, I gotta say, it's a strange piece of art, but it's fun."
23:06;23:09;"And it's very Mick."
23:09;23:12;"It's very on brand that he's like, he's been chomping at the bit."
23:12;23:14;"Very social guy."
23:14;23:19;"A lot of the other kind of boomer rock stars, they got in the mix a little earlier."
23:19;23:23;"I don't think we ever listened to it, but we talked about Van Morrison wrote a series"
23:23;23:25;"of anti lockdown songs."
23:25;23:27;"Well, I want to get into that next."
23:27;23:29;"Yes, please."
23:29;23:33;"Let's just spend the whole episode listening to boomer COVID songs."
23:33;23:35;"We could actually, is this the best one you've heard?"
23:35;23:37;"I haven't actually heard the Van Morrison song yet."
23:37;23:38;"I'm dying to hear it."
23:38;23:40;"Okay, maybe now's the time."
23:40;23:41;"Wait, sorry, but hold on."
23:41;23:43;"Yeah, can we just move forward to the last verse?"
23:43;23:49;"Okay, verse three, shooting the vaccine, Bill Gates in my bloodstream."
23:49;23:50;"It's mind control."
23:50;23:52;"The earth is flat and cold."
23:52;23:54;"It's never warming up."
23:54;23:56;"The Arctic's turned to slush."
23:56;23:58;"The second's coming late."
23:58;24:00;"There's aliens in the deep state."
24:00;24:01;"I love it."
24:01;24:02;"He went there."
24:02;24:04;"He went full Joe Rogan or-"
24:04;24:05;"Even beyond."
24:05;24:07;"That's like Alex Jones."
24:07;24:11;"I mean, I think it's a parody of that, I'm assuming."
24:11;24:18;"Because Mick is too self-aware and savvy to put himself out on some whack political stance"
24:18;24:21;"that's going to alienate people, much like Van Morrison did."
24:21;24:25;"Van Morrison's sort of like, and Eric Clapton are like, ""I don't care about my reputation."
24:25;24:27;"I'm an old cranky guy."
24:27;24:28;"F you."""
24:28;24:30;"But Mick is still like, ""I'm in the mix."
24:30;24:31;"I'm hip."
24:31;24:32;"I want to be liked."""
24:32;24:36;"It's not impossible to imagine Mick, to his credit, it's what you want from Mick, but"
24:36;24:39;"kind of almost being like, ""Maybe this song could be a f***ing hit."
24:39;24:41;"Maybe it goes viral on TikTok."""
24:41;24:43;"Although, I guess if he didn't-"
24:43;24:44;"It kind of was a hit."
24:44;24:45;"Was it a hit?"
24:45;24:46;"It can't."
24:46;24:47;"I mean, we're talking about it."
24:47;24:48;"It's an NFT."
24:49;24:51;"Okay, wait, yeah, that's-"
24:51;24:52;"Who bought the NFT?"
24:52;24:53;"We've got to research that."
24:53;24:55;"That's another element, that the song is an NFT."
24:55;24:57;"It's so weak."
24:57;24:59;"How much did the NFT version of it go for?"
24:59;25:00;"How much?"
25:00;25:01;"Let me find out."
25:01;25:02;"It's a charity."
25:02;25:03;"It is a charity."
25:03;25:04;"Oh."
25:04;25:05;"I don't know if the auction is-"
25:05;25:06;"Good call, man."
25:06;25:08;"It went on sale last Thursday."
25:08;25:14;"All proceeds from the NFT sale will be divvied up between Music Venue Trust, a UK-based"
25:14;25:19;"charity for music venues, and National Independent Venue Association."
25:19;25:20;"Oh, that's great."
25:20;25:21;"Tight."
25:21;25:22;"Very cool, gentlemen."
25:22;25:25;"But also very curious how much that NFT is going for."
25:25;25:33;"I just feel like the NFT crowd and the Easy Sleazy crowd, it's not the most obvious intersection."
25:33;25:34;"Yeah."
25:34;25:38;"I'm just picturing the 22-year-old crypto billionaire."
25:38;25:42;"This comes across their desk, and they're just like, ""What?"
25:42;25:43;"Who?"""
25:43;25:48;"I don't think there's any public information right now about what it sold for."
25:48;25:50;"Sold for 60 bucks."
25:50;25:58;"Mick was very disappointed."
25:58;26:00;"It underperformed at auction."
26:00;26:05;"No money went to the charities."
26:05;26:11;"Mick is like, ""Well, mate, it cost us at least two grand to make the song, man."
26:11;26:17;"Between a Zoom, my premium Zoom subscription, electricity, mate."""
26:17;26:20;"Wait, I think I got it."
26:20;26:21;"Okay."
26:21;26:27;"The auction, so on a site called Nifty Gateway, which I guess is Mick Jagger's profile for"
26:27;26:28;"the sale."
26:28;26:31;"That's an NFT platform."
26:31;26:33;"Oh, got it."
26:33;26:34;"Okay, great."
26:34;26:36;"Okay, so this is where he was selling it."
26:36;26:38;"$50,000 was the highest bid."
26:38;26:39;"Okay."
26:39;26:40;"To an anonymous bidder."
26:40;26:41;"Correct."
26:41;26:42;"Okay, that was probably Mick Jagger."
26:42;26:47;"I guess one question I have is when you hear about these big NFT auctions, still know very"
26:47;26:49;"little about it."
26:49;26:53;"Like when you heard about the really expensive Beeple one, they always reference that it's"
26:53;26:55;"a crypto billionaire who bought it."
26:55;27:01;"I wonder if there's just any super rich person who heard about NFTs and was like, ""Well,"
27:01;27:07;"I don't have any crypto, but I would love to have that new whatever, like Taco Bell"
27:07;27:13;"one,"" or if anybody actually just converted like USD into crypto just to like get in."
27:13;27:14;"At the height of the market?"
27:14;27:15;"Right."
27:15;27:18;"Like it's one thing if you have more cryptocurrency than you know what to do with."
27:18;27:22;"It's another thing just to be like, just call your accountant, just like, ""I'm going to"
27:22;27:27;"need you to buy me $3 million of Ethereum right now because I got out of this."""
27:27;27:28;"Are you sure?"
27:28;27:29;"Because the market's real hot."
27:29;27:32;"It might cool off at any second."
27:32;27:34;"We'll see."
27:34;27:35;"Okay."
27:35;27:36;"Shout out to Mick Jagger."
27:36;27:37;"Solid song."
27:37;27:38;"Okay."
27:38;27:39;"So classic Mick."
27:39;27:40;"He's excited to party."
27:40;27:47;"Lockdown has probably been very boring for him, but he's not getting in the mix too early."
27:47;27:50;"Although this would have been a tight song to drop just like in the middle of lockdown."
27:50;27:53;"Maybe he didn't quite have enough material."
27:53;27:55;"That would have been fun like summer."
27:55;28:00;"Well, I think pre-vaccine rollout, it would have been weird to drop this because like"
28:00;28:03;"last summer, it was unclear what the vaccine timeline was."
28:03;28:06;"It would have been like, ""Someday we'll get out of this and party."""
28:06;28:07;"Right."
28:07;28:09;"Might've gotten some heat."
28:09;28:11;"So yeah, maybe we finally need to dive in."
28:11;28:15;"I can't even imagine what this s*** sounds like, dive into the Van Morrison."
28:15;28:21;"Just before we do, Ezra, if Mick gives you a call or his people reach out to your people"
28:21;28:26;"and they want you on Easy Sleazy, how do you respond?"
28:26;28:28;"I would just say, ""You got the wrong guy."""
28:28;28:30;"I just don't think I'm bringing anything to the project."
28:30;28:35;"I'm not even like being trying to get out of it and be like, ""Mick, you're an absolute legend."
28:35;28:37;"I worship you."
28:37;28:39;"Huge fan of everything you do."""
28:39;28:41;"But I'd just kind of be like, ""You know what?"
28:41;28:46;"I would probably take the easy way out and say just like, ""Maybe I could contribute some lyrics."""
28:46;28:49;"Again, Dave Grohl, he can play everything."
28:49;28:50;"He's the classic rock dude."
28:50;28:53;"He probably had a blast putting the music together."
28:53;28:54;"That wouldn't be me."
28:54;28:55;"Are you talking about a remix?"
28:55;28:58;"Or are you talking about like hypothetically the original?"
28:58;29:00;"I was thinking original."
29:00;29:01;"Mick wants to get me on a remix."
29:01;29:04;"I like the idea of he approaches Ezra for the remix."
29:04;29:08;"Slightly longer, multiple guest verses, different beat."
29:08;29:09;"Danny Brown."
29:10;29:11;"Yeah."
29:11;29:15;"So we got a lot of material to get through, folks."
29:15;29:20;"Van Morrison released a three-song EP about the lockdown."
29:20;29:22;"And then later, Eric Clapton--"
29:22;29:30;"I love the concept of a Van Morrison EP in 2021."
29:30;29:35;"And then after the EP, Eric Clapton was releasing a song called ""Stand and Deliver,"""
29:35;29:38;"and he asked Van Morrison to jump on it with him,"
29:38;29:41;"probably because he knew they were like-minded."
29:41;29:43;"What's the first song on the Van Morrison EP?"
29:43;29:45;"""Stand and Deliver,"" is that it?"
29:45;29:47;"Well, no, that's the Eric Clapton one."
29:47;29:49;"Let's hear the song that kicked it all off."
29:49;29:52;"Let's go to the Van Morrison and listen to it."
29:52;29:55;"Oh, well, there's a song called ""No More Lockdown."""
29:55;29:56;"Pretty straightforward."
29:56;29:57;"Direct."
29:57;30:02;"♪"
30:02;30:04;"♪ No more lockdown"
30:04;30:08;"♪ No more government overreach"
30:08;30:12;"♪ No more fascist bullies"

30:37;30:40;"♪ Who's running our world"
30:40;30:42;"His voice sounds pretty good."
30:42;30:45;"♪ Examine it closely"
30:45;30:48;"♪ And watch it unfurl"
30:48;30:50;"So it's very conspiratorial."
30:50;30:54;"♪ No more lockdown"
30:54;30:58;"♪ No more threats"
30:58;31:02;"♪ No more Imperial College"
31:02;31:05;"♪ Scientists making up crooked facts"
31:05;31:07;"So he just doesn't even believe in it."
31:07;31:09;"He's full on the train of, like,"
31:09;31:11;"this is, like, a global world order"
31:11;31:14;"that wants to control people."
31:14;31:18;"♪ No more celebrities telling us"
31:18;31:22;"♪ Telling us what we're supposed to feel"
31:22;31:24;"♪ No more status quo"
31:24;31:25;"That much of a reach for Van?"
31:25;31:28;"I mean, he was always sort of like a new-agey,"
31:28;31:30;"like, just connect with your inner life,"
31:30;31:32;"and, like, it's not a far leap"
31:32;31:34;"from, like, 60s spiritual guy,"
31:34;31:36;"like, Astroweeks,"
31:36;31:38;"to, like, distrusting major institutions"
31:38;31:41;"and, like, being paranoid 50 years."
31:41;31:42;"It's not that much of a leap."
31:42;31:44;"Well, he says the Imperial College scientists"
31:44;31:46;"were making up crooked facts."
31:46;31:48;"He's just asking questions."
31:48;31:50;"Play Born to be Free."
31:50;31:53;"I want to get a little more understanding"
31:53;31:55;"of his point of view."
31:55;31:57;"♪"
31:57;32:00;"Ooh, this sounds good."
32:00;32:02;"It's a real 60s throwback."
32:02;32:10;"♪"
32:10;32:15;"♪ Well, will the birds in the trees"
32:15;32:19;"♪ Know something we can't see"
32:19;32:25;"♪ Does he know we were born to be free"
32:25;32:26;"Pretty normal so far."

32:35;32:38;"♪ Take you in with a phony smile"
32:38;32:40;"♪ Wouldn't you agree"
32:40;32:43;"I mean, yeah, this could have been from the 60s."
32:43;32:44;"Right."
32:44;32:45;"♪ And you're normal"
32:45;32:46;"Questions authority."

45:55;45:59;"I still think about that idea that Bob Dylan--"
45:59;46:01;"and again, maybe we're giving him too much credit,"
46:01;46:03;"but it's still an interesting way to think--"
46:03;46:07;"the idea that people pick these huge defining events"
46:07;46:09;"as like something that shifted culture."
46:09;46:12;"COVID is a slow, painful one,"
46:12;46:18;"compared to an immediate assassination or an act of terrorism like 9/11."

46:39;46:42;"it all started with the JFK assassination was like, whoa."

46:45;46:48;"If you believe he was just killed by one person"
46:48;46:52;"and Jake has actually done original research at Dealey Plaza in Dallas,"
46:52;46:54;"so I trust you, Jake."
46:54;46:56;"Well, I don't know."
46:56;46:59;"I'm very agnostic on the JFK assassination,"
46:59;47:02;"but all I'll say is when I was in the window"
47:02;47:06;"looking down onto the spot where Kennedy was shot,"
47:06;47:09;"it did seem remarkably close."
47:09;47:11;"Right. You don't have to be a sharp shooter."
47:11;47:14;"All of the stuff with the three shots within a certain amount of time,"
47:14;47:17;"I'm very agnostic. I'm open to all--"
47:17;47:21;"Whether you believe it was a conspiracy or even just an emotional moment--"
47:21;47:23;"It was a turkey shoot!"
47:23;47:26;"Even just an emotional moment where people felt like,"
47:26;47:30;"wow, you can't trust anything. Things can change."
47:30;47:33;"The idea that, again, Bob Dylan in the time of COVID"
47:33;47:38;"decided to go back 60 years-ish to that event"
47:38;47:41;"and felt like this is the moment for me to talk about that"
47:41;47:46;"as if that was a turning point moment that we're still in,"
47:46;47:50;"again, so much more interesting than just saying you can't trust the government."
47:50;47:52;"And that's why Bob Dylan--"
47:52;47:53;"There's an article."
47:53;47:55;"You're our Boomer of the Week."
47:55;47:58;"No, you're a pre-Boomer of the Week."
47:58;48:02;"There's an article on the HuffPo-- or the Huffington Post"
48:02;48:07;"that says Bob Dylan responds to coronavirus with a song about the JFK assassination."
48:07;48:11;"So I do feel there's other people on your wavelength."
48:11;48:14;"And it was so early and during COVID that it was like--"
48:14;48:16;"It was like week two."
48:16;48:18;"Man, I'd love to know what that conversation was."
48:18;48:21;"Was Bob just straight up-- he just looked around and he was like, ""Now's the time."""
48:21;48:24;"I mean, he's probably going to release an album that year anyway, but who knows."
48:24;48:31;"It was a dark day in Dallas, November '63."
48:31;48:37;"A day that would have haunted him for me."
48:37;48:41;"President Kennedy was a right lie."
48:41;48:45;"Good day to be living and a good day to die."
48:45;48:49;"He led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb."
48:49;48:54;"He said, ""Wait a minute, boys. You know who I am."""
48:54;48:58;"""Of course we do. We know who you are."""
48:58;49:04;"Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car."
49:04;49:09;"Shot down like a dog in broad daylight."
49:09;49:14;"Was a matter of timing and the timing was right."
49:14;49:19;"You got unpaid debts? We've come to collect."
49:19;49:23;"We're going to kill you with hatred without any respect."
49:23;49:28;"Okay, we made it through a lot of boomer rock songs, but Jake just found one that we can't ignore."
49:28;49:32;"So before we get to the top five, let's throw this one on real quick. You want to introduce it, Jake?"
49:32;49:34;"It's called ""This Too Shall Pass."""
49:34;49:37;"Mike Love featuring John Stamos."
49:37;49:41;"I mean, we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, but we--"
49:41;49:45;"Let's just go to some dark aesthetic territory."
49:45;49:59;"We all remember when stool is out was a cause for celebrations."
49:59;50:06;"Nobody ever even thought about closing down entire nations."
50:06;50:11;"These songs are all kind of similar."
50:11;50:19;"Shaking hands is a thing of the past due to social distancing."
50:19;50:25;"People are wondering how long it'll last. As the saying goes, ""This too shall pass."""
50:25;50:34;"Well, I believe the best is yet to come, so let's get back to having fun, fun, fun in the sun."
50:34;50:39;"Okay, this is a little more posi-core. He's like, ""This sucks. This is a bummer."""
50:39;50:43;"So when did this come out? Oh, this is like May last year."
50:43;50:47;"See, this is like the original ""Easy Sleazy."""
50:47;50:53;"First responders and the National Guard, doctors and nurses all working real hard."
50:53;50:54;"Right on, Mike."
50:54;51:00;"It's kind of like a viral Super Bowl, so do unto others, it's good for the soul."
51:00;51:07;"All 50 states with a unified goal. God bless America, that's how we roll."
51:07;51:13;"People are wondering how long it'll last. As the saying goes, ""This too shall pass."""
51:13;51:22;"Well, I believe the best is yet to come, so let's get back to having fun, fun, fun in the sun."
51:22;51:27;"I love the phasing on those ""fun, fun, fun"" harmonies."
51:27;51:30;"This is pretty inspired, I gotta say."
51:30;51:35;"We're turning lemons into lemonade. Just be cautious, don't be afraid."
51:35;51:38;"Oh, it's John Stamos on drums. Probably harmonies, too."
51:38;51:42;"The sooner we do, this pandemic will end."
51:42;51:47;"Stamos has a weird career, Full House and the Beach Boys drummer."
51:47;51:53;"I still don't understand. He met the Beach Boys on Full House, and then they hired him, or he had a pre-existing?"
51:53;51:54;"Is that what happened?"
51:54;51:56;"Or did he know them already, and that's why they came on?"
51:56;52:00;"I remember there was an episode of Full House with the Beach Boys in it."
52:00;52:06;"Yeah, it's classic. Did he bring them on because he already knew them from playing music?"
52:06;52:10;"Was Brian on that episode? No, I don't think so."
52:10;52:14;"Well, actually, what am I saying? Maybe? Go to them."
52:14;52:22;"Mike Love became friends with John Stamos back when John Stamos was on General Hospital in 1982."
52:22;52:35;"According to Love, the beloved actor had always been a huge fan and was even the main ingredient behind the Beach Boys movie getting made, as well as the 2000 TV miniseries he produced both."
52:35;52:36;"Okay."
52:36;52:39;"So basically, he was a soap opera star that met a Beach Boy."
52:39;52:40;"They hit it off."
52:40;52:42;"And was just like, ""Hey, dude."""
52:42;52:43;"I'm a big fan."
52:43;52:49;"You know, Dennis Wilson just died two years ago. His solo record from '80 is amazing."
52:49;52:56;"I wonder if Mike Love, or if John Stamos, really knows the deep Beach Boys stuff."
52:56;53:00;"You know, the Beach Boys Holland. Beach Boys love you."
53:00;53:04;"Well, you know something? If we're going there, I've always found this interesting."
53:04;53:13;"As I recall on Full House, there's an episode. I don't know if it involves the Beach Boys or it involves him and his band."
53:13;53:19;"They have a hit song, and the song is an old Beach Boys song called ""Forever."""
53:19;53:25;"If every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever."
53:25;53:27;"Wait, bring that up. That song rules."
53:27;53:28;"Yeah, it's a great song."
53:28;53:34;"So anyway, in the episode, they use that song to be Uncle Jesse's hit."
53:34;53:37;"And he gets big in Japan and all this stuff."
53:37;53:43;"I remember being a kid seeing that and being like, ""This is kind of a good song that somebody wrote for Full House."""
53:43;53:47;"And then getting older and realizing, ""No, this is a deeper Beach Boys song."""
53:47;53:50;"Like, it's on Sunflower or something."
53:50;53:52;"Yeah, one of those records."
53:52;54:03;"If John Stamos actually picked this, he was like, ""Yo, we should do 'Forever' by the Beach Boys."""
54:03;54:04;"He's kind of ahead."
54:06;54:08;"Who's doing vocals here, you think?"
54:08;54:09;"I don't know."
54:09;54:14;"It's not Brian."
54:14;54:16;"It's Dennis."
54:16;54:18;"Dude, Dennis."
54:18;54:22;"Ezra, are you into that Dennis record, ""Pacific Ocean Blue""?"
54:22;54:25;"I've never gone deep. I know people always talk about that."
54:25;54:28;"Dude, that record rules. I listen to that record more than I listen to the Beach Boys."
54:28;54:29;"Really?"
54:29;54:30;"It lasts like three or four years."
54:30;54:31;"I'll check it out."
54:31;54:33;"I throw that record on all the time."
54:33;54:38;"There's some clunkers, but the bulk of that is just beautiful ballads."

55:58;56:01;"it's actually quite a story."
56:01;56:02;"Hit me."
56:02;56:06;"So when he was on General Hospital in the early '80s,"
56:06;56:08;"he went to a Beach Boys concert,"
56:08;56:12;"but he got recognized and chased and ended up hiding backstage"

56:16;56:18;"They were still going to do the encore."

56:46;56:48;"He didn't even know if he played an instrument?"
56:48;56:50;"- I mean, I guess Stamos left him. - He's like, ""Get that guy on stage."""
56:50;56:51;"Stamos was like, ""Whoa!"""
56:51;56:53;"And he's like, ""All right, what do you play, Stamos?"""
56:53;56:55;"- He's behind the kit. - ""I can hold it down on the drums."
56:55;56:58;"""All right. Barbara Ann, one, two, three, four."""

01:02:41;01:02:42;"You only get so much until it's gone."

01:02:46;01:02:49;"Good country writers, you would think,"
01:02:49;01:02:53;"how much more could you say about a bottle of beer and a truck?"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"I know."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Is there anything left to say in like--"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"whether it's a love song, a party song,"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"and then somebody's like sitting there, and they're like,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"""Well, what if we talk about the ways that, you know,"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"a bottle of beer and a truck only last so long?"""
01:03:05;01:03:07;"OK, how are we going to hit that?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Well, you could look at it numerically."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"All right, damn."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"Still squeezing something out of there."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"What if you're drinking a Tallboy, though, dude?"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"It's like a good beer could have 16 ounces."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"It could have, you know, 22 ounces."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"That's right."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"Duracell's and Imagilite."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"That jumped out at me."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I'm going to say something about Duracell's."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Duracell's and Imagilite, yeah, that doesn't last forever."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"A needle drop on a 45 are the kind of things that only last so long."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"OK?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Talking about records."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"These are good lyrics."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Just straight up."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"When the new wears off and they get to getting old,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"sooner or later, time's going to take its toll."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"True."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"But then he and his wife are still together."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"The way the moonlight dances in your eyes,"
01:03:45;01:03:49;"just a t-shirt in the kitchen with no makeup and a million other things"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"that I could look at my whole life."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"A love like that makes a man have second thoughts."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"Maybe some things last forever after all."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"They are really good lyrics."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"When you really think about the logic, just imagine being, you know, the wife,"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"and he's like, you know, baby, I was thinking about something."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"A good beer."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"There's something about us that's built to last."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And she's like, absolutely."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"I feel that same way."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"And he's like, because I used to wonder if we might have the shelf life of,"
01:04:13;01:04:18;"say, a beer or a truck or various other things that are not known to last forever."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"But I think we could actually-- she's like, what the f***?"
01:04:21;01:04:25;"Baby, we're going to last longer than a couple Duracells and a Maglite."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Well, it's heavy, though, because it's like--"
01:04:27;01:04:34;"if you think about a 12-ounce beer as some sort of analogous symbol for a marriage,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"because both are finite."
01:04:36;01:04:39;"A beer you're going to consume within a few minutes."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"A marriage, hopefully, will last decades."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"And it's sort of like, okay, we've been married for eight years."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"What is that the equivalent of?"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"I've had three ounces of this beer."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Ah, I see."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Right, if you scale it."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"We're in our 30s or 40s."
01:04:54;01:04:58;"Hopefully, we'll be married for another 30 or 40-- another 40 years, 50 years."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Then the beer's getting a little warm."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"[laughter]"
01:05:03;01:05:07;"So this is like we're an ounce, two or three, hopefully."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Yeah."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Right?"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"If you look at the marriage as a beer."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Okay."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"But very romantic."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Yeah."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"That's a new Mountain Brew song, Marriage as a Beer."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Do you remember Marriage is Work?"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Marriage is Work."
01:05:21;01:05:24;"That'll be like the Mountain Brew's marriage album."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Track one, Marriage is a Beer."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Track two, Marriage is Work."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"Track three, just my wife."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Track four, Government Website."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"And you just throw in Government Website."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"It's kind of like, Jake, what were you thinking with that one?"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"You're just like, you know, that was--"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"I'll be honest, it's not exactly a wife song,"
01:05:41;01:05:47;"but it's-- I had it lying around for a while since COVID."
01:05:47;01:05:50;"The number four song, 1964 Country Charts, Buck Owens,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"My Heart Skips a Beat."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"Buck Owens is from Bakersfield, right?"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"Yeah, Buck Owens had a venue up in Bakersfield for years."
01:06:01;01:06:05;"He died a long time ago, but I think it's still open,"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"Buck Owens Crystal Palace."
01:06:08;01:06:14;"I think there is a Bakersfield Country Music Museum up in Bakersfield."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Right, I've heard about that."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"We've got to do a road trip up there."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Yeah, that'd be tight."
01:06:23;01:06:27;"I always thought a documentary about music in Bakersfield would be interesting"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"because in the '50s and '60s, it was the Bakersfield sound,"
01:06:31;01:06:36;"which is a classic sound, Buck Owens, Merle Haggard,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"and it influenced the Byrds and Grant Parsons."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"Then you jump forward to the late '90s and early 2000s,"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"and it's like corn."
01:06:44;01:06:49;"And I think there's some interesting narrative there."
01:07:05;01:07:09;"So is this like--the Bakersfield sound is like the guitar stuff like this?"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"Well, I think it's like--you know how, remember on the Hank Williams Jr. song,"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"there was all that sort of ornate orchestration?"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"Oh, and this is like tougher, no strings?"
01:07:18;01:07:21;"This is just like bare bones, like bar band."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Right."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"You know, this makes me think, because we're talking about '64 being the year"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"of the British invasion and all that stuff."
01:07:31;01:07:37;"Obviously now country has so many--resonates in such a specific way"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"that people like country, they don't like country, whatever."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"It's associated with such a specific type of person."
01:07:44;01:07:50;"But I wonder, like, 1964, if you're just like a cool kid somewhere,"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"you know, this music is not that different than like British invasion rock and roll."
01:07:54;01:07:58;"It's like the same elements, different swing, but back then,"
01:07:58;01:08:03;"if you were like, I don't know, from like suburban Boston or something,"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"and you heard that, would you just be like, ""All right, that's like some country stuff,"""
01:08:06;01:08:08;"and then you'd hear the Rolling Stones be like, ""This is badass."""
01:08:08;01:08:10;"Or would you hear that and be kind of like, ""No, I like all this s--t."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"I like the Stones. I like them."""
01:08:12;01:08:15;"You know what I mean? How close are those things on the spectrum?"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"I don't know if you were like a teenager if they were that close."
01:08:18;01:08:23;"Because like, the Beatles covered Buck Owens on the Help album."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"They covered ""Act Naturally."""
01:08:25;01:08:30;"I could be wrong here, but I feel like that was sort of like a cool..."
01:08:30;01:08:35;"Like, they loved Buck Owens, but maybe their fans weren't hip to that."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"Wouldn't have been as in--"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"It was sort of like a weird move."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"Like, ""Oh, the Beatles covered Buck Owens? That's..."""
01:08:41;01:08:44;"And Ringo sang it, you know, it was kind of like a joke a little bit."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"Oh, that Ringo gets to do the country song?"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Yeah."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Wow. I didn't even know that."
01:08:49;01:08:53;"Damn, that's like the perfect anecdote for my question about like early rock--"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"or like British Invasion rock and country."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"The Beatles actually covered Buck Owens."
01:08:57;01:09:01;"I bet if you were like a little older, like in your early 20s, in the mid-60s,"
01:09:01;01:09:05;"and like maybe you had listened to Buck Owens earlier,"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"and then like the Beatles came around and you were like, ""I'm hip to this,"""
01:09:07;01:09:12;"and then you could like-- you had more of like a wide-angle view of it all."
01:09:12;01:09:16;"But if you were like a 13-year-old that like got into the Beatles"
01:09:16;01:09:20;"through Ed Sullivan, you might not have been hip to Buck."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"Yeah, maybe just lived in a different world."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Making Keith definitely into country."
01:09:24;01:09:31;"All right, the number four song in 2021, Jake Owen, ""Made For You."""

01:31:40;01:31:43;"An artwork is a product of its time."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"- I guess the fact... - It's interesting."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"I was going to say, it's an interesting analysis of Taylor"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"that she can replicate it so easily."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Her stuff is so..."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I don't think..."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"I'm not a big fan. I think it's very sterile,"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"so it's easy to replicate."
01:31:58;01:32:01;"I would say she's written many, many great songs,"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"very iconic artists."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"The thing that I would say, I actually don't think it reflects on her."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"I think you made the call earlier, Jake."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"It's the technology. Anybody can do it."
01:32:10;01:32:14;"It's easier than ever for anybody to match stuff."
01:32:14;01:32:17;"It would even be easier now to do a sound-alike of something from the '60s."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"You get closer now than you could in 1992,"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"- just using plugins on Pro Tools. - True."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"I think it's the technology and the thing that it makes."
01:32:24;01:32:27;"I really think if other artists wanted to do it,"
01:32:27;01:32:30;"they probably could."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"- I don't know. - Do you guys remember"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Def Leppard did this a few years ago?"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"I was just going to bring this up, Seinfeld."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Def Leppard did this?"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"I always think of Def Leppard when this topic comes up,"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"because they re-recorded hysteria."
01:32:43;01:32:46;"Matt, if you bring up hysteria on Apple Music,"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"is it the original Mutt Lang production from '87,"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"or is it a re-record?"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"There's no way they're not going to have the original."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"Matt pulls that up."
01:32:55;01:32:58;"I was about to ask this with Taylor."
01:32:58;01:33:04;"Is she powerful enough that she can get Apple to remove"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"the one that she doesn't own the masters for?"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"So when anyone goes and plays..."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"- No. - How would you know?"
01:33:12;01:33:15;"It would be like Chappelle saying,"
01:33:15;01:33:18;"""Netflix, I don't want you to keep my show on the air,"""
01:33:18;01:33:20;"and they acquiesced and they did a deal."
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I think she could probably be powerful enough where she says,"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"""This is the version I want up."""
01:33:25;01:33:27;"It would be kind of a weird precedent,"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"because then technically if she doesn't own it,"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"obviously it's understandable why it bothers her,"
01:33:33;01:33:36;"but I think she probably did this because"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"it gives people an option,"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"and probably these will supersede the old ones."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"So the thought that I had too is that not only"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"has the technology stayed the same,"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"but it's probably easier than ever because"
01:33:47;01:33:51;"we're in the endless cycles at the end of history,"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"as people sometimes say."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"We're in the post-internet..."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"This is some Dean Kisic stuff."
01:33:57;01:34:00;"- Yeah, it's some Dean Kisic. - What if she just didn't even re-record it?"
01:34:00;01:34:03;"- That's deep. - She just put it out and said,"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"""This is my new version."""
01:34:05;01:34:07;"- That is deep. - You know what that is, Nick?"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"- Warhol messed up art prank. - That's actually Borgesian."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- Yes, absolutely. - I know I say that all the time,"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"but that's literally Borgesian,"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"because one of his famous stories is about"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"a guy just rewriting Moby Dick or something."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"Because, you know, he was this early kind of dude"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"pointing to these weird ideas of authorship"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"and meta-concepts, and the idea of just like,"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"if you just sat down and wrote something word for word,"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"does it become..."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"Is there inherently something different because of the context?"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"But that would be pretty sick."
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Taylor's version."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"I wonder if she did the... Wait, who's the..."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"Like, she did the Richard Prince argument,"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"where they were just like,"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"""You just recorded your old record..."""
01:34:46;01:34:49;"- And released it. - ""You just did an 1/8"" jack"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"out of your iPhone right into Pro Tools."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"- Oh, yeah. - And she was like,"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"""By doing that, I create a new mode of authorship."""
01:34:57;01:35:00;"Very similar to Richard Prince's Instagram paintings."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Well, yeah, because he would just print out"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Instagram posts onto canvas."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"- He wasn't even doing paintings. - Yeah."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"They were just printouts onto canvas."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"All right, do you have the Def Leppard?"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Can we A/B Def Leppard?"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"There's three different versions of it."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"There's Hysteria,"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"Hysteria Super Deluxe Edition,"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"and Hysteria Deluxe Edition."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"So there's actually three versions."
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Does it say if there's like a year?"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Does it say if there's a re-record"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"or like a release date?"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"So there's a... It says release..."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"There's one that says August 3, 1987."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Okay, that's the original."
01:35:36;01:35:39;"There's one that says..."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"The Super Deluxe Edition also says 1987."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"And the Deluxe Edition says..."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"They all say 1987."
01:35:47;01:35:50;"Well, maybe it failed so hard."
01:35:50;01:35:54;"- Yeah, they just gave up. - This is a very brutal Sonic assault."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"Can we start all three versions?"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Let's pick a... Can we just..."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"What, do you pour some sugar on me?"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"Yeah, so here's the first version."
01:36:04;01:36:07;"- Just the regular version. - Okay."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"Step inside, walk this way"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"You and me, babe"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"Hey!"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"(laughing)"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"That's an insane vocal approach."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"Step inside!"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"That's an amazing intro."
01:36:22;01:36:27;"Yeah, we like a bomb, baby, come and get it on"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"Living like a lover with a red-eye phone"
01:36:30;01:36:33;"Looking like a tramp like a video game"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"Damn unless you want it, can I be your man?"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Hey!"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"(indistinct)"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"Here's the Super Deluxe version."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"Step inside, walk this way"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"You and me, babe"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Hey!"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Sounds pretty similar."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"- Wait. - It's not a re-record."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"No, it's not a re-record. Hold on."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"I gotta Google this. What is... You gotta find the re-record."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Let me see if I can find it. Hang on."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"Here's the Deluxe edition."
01:37:08;01:37:11;"Step inside, walk this way"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"You and me, babe"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"What's he saying? ""Dua-lee-pay""?"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"(laughing)"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"- Sounds like he's saying... - You and me, babe."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Dua-lee-pay."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Wait, what are we listening to?"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Okay."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Oh, my God."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"This is the Deluxe version."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"- I think this is all the same. - It's all the same."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"He's just remastered."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Looking like a tramp like a video game"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Damn unless you want it, can I be your man?"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Hey!"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Wait, I'm trying to get to the bottom of this."
01:37:41;01:37:44;"Def Leppard released a new re-recorded version of Hysteria"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"on this date in 2013"
01:37:46;01:37:49;"ahead of their first Las Vegas residency."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"- Oh! - Oh, no intro."
01:37:54;01:37:57;"- Maybe they thought the intro was too hard. - So this is from 2013?"
01:37:57;01:38:03;"Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on"
01:38:03;01:38:06;"Living like a lover with a red-eye phone"
01:38:06;01:38:09;"- Looking like a tramp, can I be your man? - Sounds like he's saying ""phone."""
01:38:09;01:38:12;"- Demolition woman, can I be your man? - Can I be your..."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"Yeah, so the fans were not feeling this."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"- It's just... - I mean..."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"- The uncanny valley, right? - Although this is not a million miles away."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"Just off enough."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Okay, that wasn't terrible."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"- No, it was bad. - But what was the time..."
01:38:24;01:38:27;"How many years had passed since the original to the re-recorded?"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"- Exactly, decades. - 25."
01:38:29;01:38:32;"If you've been listening to Hysteria for decades"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"and then there's a version that's slightly different,"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"- it's gonna drive you insane. - Yes."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"- There's no way that that's gonna work. - It's tough."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"You gotta be at the end of history to pull it off."
01:38:41;01:38:44;"- Def Leppard was like 10 years too early. - Yeah, 10 years too early."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"- And also, they were... - They should do it again."
01:38:46;01:38:50;"Yeah, they could recreate the 2012 one pretty well, I bet."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"- Well, that would be... - Do you think..."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"We're having a hard time recreating the '80s,"
01:38:54;01:38:58;"but we're positive we could do a 2021 version of the 2012 version."
01:38:58;01:39:02;"Did they lose the intro"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"because the isolated vocals,"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"there's just no way to have matched?"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"Oh, 'cause their voices sound so different?"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"- Yeah, but if they could do it... - Yeah, I feel like maybe..."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"- Then why didn't they? - I feel like they tried"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"and they were just like, ""It doesn't sound good."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"Let's just cut the intro."""
01:39:16;01:39:18;"That's also crazy, just to cut the intro"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"for the re-record."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"Step inside!"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Wait, wait, wait. To your earlier point,"
01:39:24;01:39:27;"what if they just sampled the intro"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"from the original track, and then, what?"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"They would have had to pay royalties"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"just for that one snippet"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"- to the original record company? - Yeah, it would defeat the purpose."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"They'd have to go to the same record label to clear it."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"And they'd say, ""Go f*** yourself."""
01:39:39;01:39:44;"But would it cost less if the record label was like,"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"""Sure, like... 'Cause they're not sampling the entire song."""
01:39:47;01:39:49;"No, I don't..."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"I don't see it happening."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Alright."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"They had a very contingent relationship at that point,"
01:39:54;01:39:57;"so it was gonna be an uphill battle."
01:39:57;01:40:01;"- Okay, the number one song. - God, I love that."
01:40:01;01:40:04;"The Borghesean nature of Def Leppard."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"The number one song"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"this week in 1964,"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"Johnny Cash, ""Understand Your Man."""
01:40:10;01:40:13;"Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright."""
01:40:15;01:40:17;"Oh, interesting."
01:40:17;01:40:21;"This is five years before they collaborated on ""Nashville Skyline."""
01:40:21;01:40:32;"- Oh, there it is. - Oh, yeah, there it is."
01:40:32;01:40:36;"Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking."
01:40:36;01:40:40;"I'll be gone like I said."
01:40:40;01:40:47;"You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"This part too."
01:40:48;01:40:52;"Stay there in your bed, keep your mouth shut 'til I'm gone."
01:40:52;01:40:57;"Don't give me that old familiar crying, cussing noise."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Oh, it's like the same song."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Understand your man."
01:41:00;01:41:04;"Interesting, he said he played this to an audience in 2003."
01:41:04;01:41:08;"And prior to playing it, he said he had not played the song in 25 years."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"Ooh, deep bust out."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"That's real deep."
01:41:12;01:41:20;"That's a cool thing about a vampire show in 25 years."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"- Busting out. - We haven't played Hannah Hunt in 25 years."
01:41:23;01:41:29;"That was the last song you ever performed in front of an audience."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"- Well... - Oh, it was?"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"Yeah."
01:41:31;01:41:38;"I guess one thing you can say about Bob Dylan,"
01:41:38;01:41:41;"because people always called him out because a lot of his early songs"
01:41:41;01:41:44;"heavily borrowed melodies from other stuff."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"But he doesn't have songwriting on this, so maybe he was like,"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"""All right, do your thing, Johnny."""
01:41:49;01:41:50;"I can't say sh*t."
01:41:50;01:41:54;"Give my other suit to the Salvation Army."
01:41:54;01:41:58;"And everything else I leave behind."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"It truly is such cool, weird music, just like so little is happening."
01:42:01;01:42:06;"Makes me think of the Taco Bell commercial"
01:42:06;01:42:09;"that we were talking about a few weeks ago."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Wait, what was that?"
01:42:10;01:42:13;"- The Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial. - Oh my God, yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"Wait, what's the Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial?"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"It was like a dumb pun on cash, right?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"And he appeared in it?"
01:42:21;01:42:24;"He's in it, yeah. He's like on camera."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"And in 1992..."
01:42:26;01:42:29;"Whoa, a '92 Johnny Cash Taco Bell commercial."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"It might be worth listening to."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"- Throw it on. - Throw it on."
01:42:55;01:42:59;"Where else you gonna get so many choices with just a little cash?"
01:42:59;01:43:03;"- It's so tight. - Great song."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Great performance by Johnny."
01:43:05;01:43:08;"I mean, you think of him, Johnny Cash,"
01:43:08;01:43:12;"his reputation and the culture is one of the most badass,"
01:43:12;01:43:18;"authentic, uncompromising, true country stars."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"I love it."
01:43:19;01:43:23;"He's just singing the words, ""Taco Bell."""
01:43:24;01:43:27;"- Little cash. - He's in the commercial too."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"- I love it. - Look at the camera."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"- He's also hosting a show. - They're using his name."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"He's also like, ""You can use my name."""
01:43:33;01:43:35;"- The pun on my name. - It's an integration."
01:43:35;01:43:37;"- Full integration. - He's an interesting character"
01:43:37;01:43:40;"because he also hosted a television show."
01:43:40;01:43:44;"He was a full-on showbiz guy, clearly."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"I just think by the standards of country,"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"he was like..."
01:43:47;01:43:51;"By the standards of this kind of fancy country world,"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"he was the rebel."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"But yeah, he was like..."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"He's an older dude."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"He's not some punk rocker."
01:43:57;01:44:00;"That commercial's kind of funny because they picked Johnny Cash"
01:44:00;01:44:03;"because they have a lot of cheap food or something,"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"a dollar menu."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"But it's like this idea of where else can you get so much"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"for just a little cash?"
01:44:09;01:44:13;"If his name was like dollar, it would make more sense."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"There's many places you can get some food for a little cash."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"There's something about..."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"It doesn't quite fit."
01:44:19;01:44:22;"Or if his name was like little money."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"When you come to Taco Bell, you only need a little money."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"He's like, ""At Taco Bell, you just need a little cash."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"My last name's Cash."""
01:44:27;01:44:30;"And it's like, yeah, especially in 1992,"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"you would use cash to purchase food anywhere."
01:44:32;01:44:35;"I'm failing to see what makes"
01:44:35;01:44:38;"the Taco Bell-Cash connection unique."
01:44:38;01:44:41;"If his last name was Pocket Change, it would be better."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"Yes, because at Taco Bell, I don't know, 1992,"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"could you get a 49-cent taco or something?"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"It's 2 a.m. You're walking through the drive-thru."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"They tell you that it's..."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"The indoor dining is closed."
01:44:54;01:45:00;"Sir, you need a vehicle to walk on through the drive-thru."
01:45:00;01:45:04;"So you're telling me the dining room is closed."
01:45:04;01:45:08;"And if I don't have a car, then I can't go through the drive-thru."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Well, how does that make any sense?"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Is this Johnny Cash's COVID lockdown song?"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Is that what's happening?"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"No, the drive-thru, like,"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"""Sir, the dining room closed at 10 p.m."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"and now it's 1 10 a.m."""
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Oh, yeah, this is just like late night."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"The dining room is closed."
01:45:26;01:45:29;"All right, the number one song right now on the country charts."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"This dude's trying to walk through the drive-thru."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"Walking through the drive-thru."
01:45:34;01:45:37;"The number one song this week."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"I just have to say one thing real quick before you do it."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"The commercial itself is so vibey."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"It's so awesome."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"It looks like a Jake painting."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"It's of a TV."
01:45:48;01:45:51;"They're filming a TV, like, out in the desert."
01:45:51;01:45:55;"And so you're just sort of pushing in on a TV"
01:45:55;01:45:58;"with Johnny Cash on the TV."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"It's really--"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"It's like a music video."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"It's Borghesean."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Okay."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Everybody check that out."
01:46:04;01:46:07;"The number one song this week on the country charts"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"is Gabby Barrett."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"It's called ""The Good Ones."""
01:46:11;01:46:13;"Not familiar."
01:46:13;01:46:22;"She said that her husband was the inspiration for this."
01:46:22;01:46:25;"It's a lot of husband and wife songs."
01:46:25;01:46:28;"All of them."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"She's definitely got a post-Taylor delivery."
01:46:31;01:46:34;"Or maybe I'm missing some of the shared DNA, but--"

01:46:53;01:46:55;"K-A-L-E."

01:47:10;01:47:12;"It's not boyfriends or girlfriends."
01:47:12;01:47:15;"I wonder if that's a wave, or if country's always been"

01:47:51;01:47:54;"interestingly similar, like, where you're kind of just"
01:47:54;01:47:58;"listing a bunch of stuff in the verses, and then the chorus"
01:47:58;01:48:01;"is about the actual relationship."
01:48:01;01:48:06;"So, ""He's a phone call to his parents, he's a Bible by the bed,"
01:48:06;01:48:10;"he's the t-shirt that I'm wearing, he's the song stuck in my head."
01:48:10;01:48:17;"He's solid and he's steady like the Allegheny River runs solid and steady."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"He knows just where he's going and he's proud of where he's from."""
01:48:20;01:48:23;"All right, she's saying that her husband's a good one."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Interesting line."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"""He's a phone call to his parents, he's a Bible by the bed,"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"he's the t-shirt that I'm wearing."""
01:48:29;01:48:33;"I guess she's saying he's just a good dude who calls his parents,"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"and the dude has a Bible by the bed?"
01:48:36;01:48:39;"Or he's as good as a Bible by the bed?"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Yeah, I'm confused as well."
01:48:41;01:48:45;"I mean, phone call to parents is a funny opening line."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"Well, you know, people like--"
01:48:46;01:48:47;"He's responsible."
01:48:47;01:48:50;"Right, he's responsible, good relationship with his family."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"And to Christ."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"And to Christ."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"And I guess she's wearing a t-shirt that he gave her."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"Second verse, ""You'll know him when you see him by the way he looks at me."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"You'd say he hung the moon, I'd say he hung the galaxy."

01:49:07;01:49:09;"He's one of the good ones."""
01:49:09;01:49:11;"Okay, obviously we get with the song--"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Yeah, it's just the phone call to the parents."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Interesting way to start."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"But yeah, this kind of feels--"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"I already forgot the names of what we already listened to."
01:49:18;01:49:23;"But this kind of feels like a gender-swapped version of"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Jake Owen, ""Made For You."""
01:49:25;01:49:28;"Definitely something in the air over there in Nashville."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"You know, it's funny."
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I feel like that first time we did that top five, ""Modern Country,"""
01:49:33;01:49:37;"it was like really strong, all winners."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"I'm not saying any of this is bad, but this is like a little samey."
01:49:40;01:49:44;"Well, I feel like they were also like real party songs,"
01:49:44;01:49:47;"like dudes just like pounding brews by the lake."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Maybe those will start kicking off in a couple months with summer."
01:49:49;01:49:51;"We need some lake songs."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"This is some like late COVID--"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"This is really domestic."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Oh, you know what? Is this wedding season?"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Is April classic wedding month or more May?"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"May, June."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"Yeah, June."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Okay."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"I think it's late COVID, man."
01:50:04;01:50:08;"People have been cooped up and they're appreciating"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"their domestic partnerships, man."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Not Mick Jagger. He's ready to go to a party."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"No one's hanging out on a--"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"No one wants to hear about people hanging out on a floating dock."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"But I do, and that's why I respect Mick."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Yeah, Mick just wants to go party."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"Mick's like, ""I'm ready to rage, dude."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"I'm 79. I don't care."""
01:50:25;01:50:28;"Mick's probably only got so many hardcore party years left."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Most of the people in their late 70s"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"probably already done with the hardcore party scene,"
01:50:32;01:50:35;"but Mick's probably got a solid 10."
01:50:35;01:50:40;"Well, he seems like a guy that really takes care of himself."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"I think of him like he either doesn't drink"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"or he drinks like four times a year."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"That's interesting."
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Actually, you know what's crazy?"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"This is a weird memory."
01:50:48;01:50:50;"When I lived in San Francisco,"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"I did grocery delivery out of this Whole Foods."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"I think we've talked about this."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"I used to see Kirk Hammett in the Whole Foods."
01:50:57;01:51:03;"Well, so there was this occasional delivery of granola,"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"weird Whole Foods granola,"
01:51:05;01:51:09;"and I forget what it was, almond milk or something,"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"to the Four Seasons."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"And it happened a few times a year."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"My boss was like, ""Oh, dude,"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"are you doing that granola delivery to the Four Seasons?"""
01:51:17;01:51:18;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
01:51:18;01:51:20;"He's like, ""That's Mick Jagger."""
01:51:20;01:51:22;"I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
01:51:22;01:51:23;"This is incredible."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"How did this never come up before?"
01:51:25;01:51:26;"I don't know."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"And I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
01:51:28;01:51:30;"He's like, ""Dude, every time Mick's in town,"
01:51:30;01:51:31;"it's a few times a year,"
01:51:31;01:51:34;"he stays at the Four Seasons downtown San Francisco,"
01:51:34;01:51:38;"and he just will order granola from us."""
01:51:38;01:51:41;"And I'm like, ""Really? How do you know?"""
01:51:41;01:51:45;"And was it the granola from the bulk, with the shovel?"
01:51:45;01:51:49;"Yeah, it's just flax seeds and all this kind of stuff."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"Right. Today, Mick would just have his brands dialed in"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"and somebody would just go do a run for him."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"Wait, what year was this?"
01:51:56;01:52:01;"2005 or 2006 or something."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"This is pre-packaged bulk granola."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"You'd get it in a little container,"
01:52:05;01:52:09;"and there's no real label on it."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"Yeah, it's like a Whole Foods bag."
01:52:11;01:52:13;"It's a Whole Foods... Exactly."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"I wasn't doing the shopping."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I would come back, and there'd be a delivery."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"Usually, a grocery delivery would have been"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"a few bags with a bunch of stuff,"
01:52:22;01:52:25;"and this would just be one paper Whole Foods bag"
01:52:25;01:52:29;"with just a bulk plastic bag of granola in it."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Generic."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"And it was going to the Four Seasons."
01:52:32;01:52:37;"Just people that would extravagantly order just one thing."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"And would you just leave it at the reception desk?"
01:52:39;01:52:40;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"It was just under some name at the Four Seasons,"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"but my boss was like, ""That's Mick Jagger, dude."""
01:52:45;01:52:48;"Right. Especially back then, I bet the delivery fee"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"cost significantly more than the item."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"Just one bag of granola."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"Oh, yeah, for sure."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"So you didn't roll up to the desk and say,"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"""You know, I would be very happy to bring it"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"directly up to Mr. Jagger."""
01:52:59;01:53:01;"[laughter]"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"I did not do that."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"I kind of thought my boss was full of s***,"
01:53:06;01:53:09;"but I also thought maybe he was--"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I thought it was like 50/50 he was right."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"I wonder."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"It was his company."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"He must have been engaging with Mick's tour manager"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"or handler or whatever."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Personal assistant."
01:53:20;01:53:21;"It's not impossible."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"No, it's not impossible."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"Right, because this is a third party."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"You're not working for Whole Foods."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Exactly. I was working for ShopHopper,"
01:53:27;01:53:32;"which was a grocery delivery service in San Francisco."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"You'd call a phone number?"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"No, you would send an email."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"I worked for this guy that was this blues guitarist guy"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"in San Francisco."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Yeah, and he was a musician guy,"
01:53:44;01:53:47;"but he had this company that he ran."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"He'd been running since the '90s."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"It was grocery delivery."
01:53:50;01:53:53;"People would call or email grocery orders."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Do you think his musician background"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"gave him a bit more of the inside track"
01:53:57;01:54:01;"as far as knowing that it was Mick Jagger?"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"Or was it more like, ""Oh, yeah, it's just,"" you know,"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"like you knew the manager or something like that?"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"I don't know."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Maybe he jammed with Mick."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Well, it's weird."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"His office was above this really cool old guitar store"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"in San Francisco."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"One time I did meet Joe Satriani"
01:54:17;01:54:20;"because I came back from a run,"
01:54:20;01:54:23;"and then my boss, Chris, was just hanging out."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"I was like, ""Oh, where are you, man?"""
01:54:25;01:54:27;"He's like, ""Oh, I'm down in the guitar shop"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"down below my office."""
01:54:28;01:54:31;"We were waiting for another order to come in."
01:54:31;01:54:34;"It was just like one of those crusty guitar shop style vibes."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"He was just hanging out with this dude named Joe,"
01:54:36;01:54:39;"and they were just talking about guitars and gear."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"He's like, ""Oh, this is my buddy Joe."""
01:54:40;01:54:42;"I was like, ""Oh, hey, I'm Jake. What's up?"""
01:54:42;01:54:44;"We were just kind of hanging out."
01:54:44;01:54:48;"Then later he's like, ""Dude, that was Joe Satriani."""
01:54:48;01:54:49;"He's an old friend."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"I was just like, ""Oh, cool, man."""
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Wow."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Joe Satriani."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"I'm on the old shop hopper's website."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"Oh, are you?"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"Oh, my goodness."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Holy Christ."
01:54:59;01:55:02;"Our fees are generally between $25 and $45"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"for a shopping and delivery to your house."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"I mean, that's so expensive."
01:55:06;01:55:10;"Because back then it was just so luxurious that, yeah."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Yeah, I mean, basically now it's free."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"This is a luxury operation."
01:55:12;01:55:15;"Yeah, so Mick got a $4 bag of granola."
01:55:15;01:55:19;"Throw down $40 for Jake's delivery."
01:55:19;01:55:25;"Well, also, Nick, this entry was posted on October 11, 2013."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"I wonder if he's still in business."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"They're real behind the eight ball on that one, I think."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"They can't be."
01:55:29;01:55:32;"And Christopher Ford was your boss?"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Yeah."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Oh, yeah."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"They got a lot of competition these days."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Imagine if just somehow, easy sleazy,"
01:55:38;01:55:41;"there's just like a random shop hopper's reference."
01:55:41;01:55:45;"""I can't wait to get back out, go to San Francisco."
01:55:45;01:55:51;"Hit up shop hoppers for my favorite granola."""
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Well, Jake, that's an amazing story."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"Good note to end on."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"I don't know if it's amazing, but--"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"It's an amazing--"
01:55:58;01:56:01;"If you're a fan of Jake, it's an amazing story."
01:56:01;01:56:04;"Just Jake delivering the granola to Mick Jagger."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"I think it's to Mick Jagger."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"Perhaps."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"When you throw in the uncertainty--"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"50/50."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"--it does become a pretty--"
01:56:12;01:56:16;"the show rolls just like, ""Yo, you know Jake may or may not"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"have once delivered Mick Jagger granola?"""
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Wait, why? Because you saw him?"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"Well, no, just like a rumor at shop hoppers."
01:56:24;01:56:28;"And he just left it at the front desk."
01:56:28;01:56:29;"Oh, right."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"So--"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"But his boss--"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"No, no, it could have been."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"It could have been."
01:56:33;01:56:36;"His boss, who was buddies with Joe Satriani,"
01:56:36;01:56:40;"told him it was for Mick Jagger."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"Mr. Jagger--"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"Jake has no reason not to believe him, yeah."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"Maybe one day you'll cross paths somehow"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"and you can bring that up."
01:56:46;01:56:47;"He might remember that [bleep] and be like,"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"""Oh, yeah, it's crazy."
01:56:49;01:56:52;"I had to drop $40 just to get my favorite granola"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"in San Francisco."""
01:56:54;01:56:57;"Well, that's a good-- great note to end on."
01:56:57;01:57:00;"All right, we'll see everybody next time."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"Shout out, Sir Mick."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Thank you for the music."
01:57:02;01:57:07;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"(electronic music)"
