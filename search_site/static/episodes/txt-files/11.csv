00:00;00:03;"Peace One."
00:03;00:10;"Time Crisis 11. Thanksgiving's over, but that doesn't mean we can't talk friends and family."
00:10;00:16;"On this episode, we're back in New York with Despot, Dave Maklovich of Chromio,"
00:16;00:20;"and the Bodega Boys themselves, Jesus and Mero."
00:20;00:27;"Come join us as we relax on this holiday weekend and listen to beautiful music"
00:27;00:30;"from people like New Kids on the Block. This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kainey."
00:34;00:37;"Peace One."
06:03;06:07;"That was East 17 with ""Stay Another Day""."
06:07;06:12;"Beautiful song from the bad boys of the UK boy band scene of the 90s."
06:12;06:16;"Welcome to Time Crisis. Today in the studio we have Despot."
06:16;06:18;"How's it going Despot?"
06:18;06:19;"Alright."
06:19;06:22;"And for the first time, my dear friend Dave Maklovich. What's up Dave?"
06:22;06:24;"It's about time."
06:24;06:27;"I know, I know. We've had some falling outs about this."
06:27;06:28;"Serious falling outs."
06:28;06:31;"It's been a long time, but you're a jet setting man."
06:31;06:34;"It's not like you're just sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring."
06:34;06:39;"No, I am. I pretend to jet set so that I actually look busy when you don't call me."
06:39;06:42;"I mean, where were you? Mexico last week?"
06:42;06:44;"Yeah."
06:44;06:46;"You're always somewhere every weekend."
06:46;06:51;"No, I'm at home, but when you call me to tell me why you didn't invite me to the show,"
06:51;06:54;"I have to make an excuse and then I say I'm on tour with my band."
06:54;06:56;"Oh, then you book like a last minute DJ set."
06:56;06:59;"Yeah, exactly. Then I got my agent and then I shoot a quick email."
06:59;07:01;"Just pop down to Mexico City."
07:01;07:02;"Exactly."
07:02;07:04;"Well, thanks for finally coming on the show Dave."
07:04;07:10;"You're now officially part of the Time Crisis family and this will be the first of many appearances we hope."
07:10;07:12;"And we got that on paper, right?"
07:12;07:15;"We have that on paper now. It's going to happen."
07:15;07:16;"Yeah, cool."
07:16;07:20;"We don't have to get into the whole back story. I think everybody knows who Chromio is,"
07:20;07:22;"but we could talk a little bit about how you and I first met."
07:22;07:26;"Because we've known each other. You're one of my oldest friends in the music business."
07:26;07:27;"That's right."
07:27;07:29;"Because I met you when I was 18 years old, 13 years ago."
07:29;07:35;"Yep. 13, yeah, exactly. In the fall of 2002."
07:35;07:41;"I was walking out of the library at Columbia and I saw this dude who looked familiar to me."
07:41;07:45;"And then I remember I saw him open for The Streets at Bowery Ballroom."
07:45;07:46;"The week before."
07:46;07:48;"The week before, which was Chromio's first show in New York."
07:48;07:53;"Chromio's second show ever and our first show in New York."
07:53;07:57;"And you were at Columbia getting your PhD."
07:57;08:00;"Yeah, it was like my third week at Columbia."
08:00;08:04;"Yeah, I don't think a lot... well, I guess maybe people used to know this about you,"
08:04;08:08;"that you were... while you're getting a PhD you have to also teach."
08:08;08:09;"That's right."
08:09;08:12;"So you were literally teaching just like intro to French at Barnard?"
08:12;08:16;"Well, no. I was teaching at Columbia while I was getting my PhD there."
08:16;08:19;"So I was doing... the first couple of years you do intro to French,"
08:19;08:23;"but I mean you have to teach for like seven years or five years."
08:23;08:28;"So by the end I was teaching like survey classes and translation classes"
08:28;08:30;"and essay writing classes and all that."
08:30;08:31;"But all in French?"
08:31;08:32;"Yeah."
08:32;08:33;"And you conduct a class in French?"
08:33;08:34;"Mm-hmm."
08:34;08:36;"And what was your thesis on?"
08:36;08:42;"The pleasure of reading in 18th century French literary theory."
08:42;08:45;"Nice. We'll be getting a lot more into that later."
08:45;08:46;"Yes."
08:47;08:50;"'Cause the last relationships of the rot"
08:50;08:53;"Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust"
08:53;08:55;"Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up"
08:55;08:57;"Spinning it away on the tabletop"
08:57;09:00;"She looked much fitter than Saturday Joss"
09:00;09:02;"She worked in JDs with Dan"
09:02;09:04;"Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough"
09:04;09:07;"But she was only wearing her work stuff"
09:07;09:09;"And in these clothes she looked more than buff"
09:09;09:12;"She stirred her straw, sat up to her Joss"
09:12;09:14;"I told her I thought it was important"
09:14;09:16;"That you could get lusty in conversation"
09:16;09:19;"Chatting shit, sitting in, oblivion"
09:19;09:21;"That person who's your special one"
09:21;09:24;"She said she was the worst pool player under the sun"
09:24;09:26;"But blokes go easy so she always won"
09:26;09:30;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
09:30;09:35;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
09:35;09:39;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
09:39;09:43;"So I reckon I could well be in"
09:44;09:47;"She didn't look too bored with what I was saying"
09:47;09:49;"Her hair looked much better than the other day"
09:49;09:52;"She had her fingers round her hair playing"
09:52;09:54;"I saw on telly that's a good indication"
09:54;09:56;"She didn't have to buy the next drink though, nay"
09:56;09:59;"But I suppose that's just our girl's way"
09:59;10:01;"I'm trying to think what else I could say"
10:01;10:04;"Peeling the label off, spinning the ashtray"
10:04;10:06;"Yeah, actually, yeah, she did look pretty neat"
10:06;10:08;"Her perfume smelled expensive and sweet"
10:08;10:11;"But I felt like my hair looked a bit cheap"
10:11;10:13;"I wished I'd had it copped back last week"
10:13;10:16;"She kept giving me this look as she would speak"
10:16;10:18;"Was she only friendly or was she a keen?"
10:18;10:20;"Asked her if she wanted the same again to drink"
10:20;10:23;"She started to turn and get up out my seat"
10:23;10:27;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
10:27;10:32;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
10:32;10:36;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
10:36;10:40;"So I reckon I could well be in"
10:41;10:44;"She said that her close mates all were"
10:44;10:46;"Always the most important thing to her"
10:46;10:49;"I said I thought it was a bit more blurred"
10:49;10:51;"She asked what I meant by that as she stirred"
10:51;10:54;"I told her about the money and what had occurred"
10:54;10:56;"With it going missing from the living room side"
10:56;10:58;"With my best mates all there standing by"
10:58;11:01;"Right where I left it, under their eyes"
11:01;11:03;"So surely one of them might have spied"
11:03;11:05;"What happened to my money at that time"
11:05;11:08;"I felt like they were all smiling on the side"
11:08;11:10;"She was like fair play, she couldn't say why"
11:10;11:12;"She didn't know what all my mates were like"
11:12;11:15;"And I said she just might be right"
11:15;11:17;"Wish I had someone I could always rely"
11:17;11:20;"Someone to get lost chatting to all night"
11:20;11:24;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
11:24;11:29;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
11:29;11:33;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
11:33;11:37;"So I reckon I could well be in"
11:37;11:42;"Earlier we were talking about birthdays today"
11:42;11:45;"Before we, you know, we have to talk about Thanksgiving"
11:45;11:47;"But before that we're talking, you know, don't forget"
11:47;11:49;"Sometimes people who have birthdays around the time of a big holiday"
11:49;11:51;"Their birthdays get kind of slept on"
11:51;11:53;"Yeah, yeah, they're always miserable"
11:53;11:54;"Yeah, it's not fun"
11:54;11:58;"Christmas birthday, July 4th birthday must just be bizarre"
11:58;12:01;"I think there's one guy who was happy his birthday was on Christmas"
12:01;12:03;"What?"
12:03;12:04;"Yeah"
12:04;12:05;"Jesus"
12:05;12:06;"That's right"
12:06;12:07;"That's the one guy, he's the only guy"
12:07;12:08;"He's the only guy"
12:08;12:11;"We were talking about holiday birthdays"
12:11;12:13;"And this is the Sunday after Thanksgiving"
12:13;12:17;"So we gotta shout out some people in the music community"
12:17;12:20;"Who have a birthday now that probably, you know, this is a day everybody's traveling"
12:20;12:22;"And probably a lot of people are forgetting about it"
12:22;12:24;"But it's Jonathan Knight from New Kid on the Block"
12:24;12:26;"New Kid's on the Block's birthday"
12:26;12:28;"He was a new kid on the block"
12:28;12:30;"He was, and I guess he still is because they still tour"
12:30;12:31;"Whoa"
12:31;12:32;"They went out with Backstreet Boys"
12:32;12:34;"Didn't they have a cruise recently or something?"
12:34;12:36;"I heard it's so tight, that must be so good"
12:36;12:37;"I heard about that"
12:37;12:38;"How did we not go to that?"
12:38;12:39;"I don't know"
12:39;12:41;"Were you guys New Kid's fans?"
12:41;12:45;"I was not, but I had that album, whichever album that was"
12:45;12:46;"With the Hangin' Tough?"
12:46;12:47;"Yeah, Hangin' Tough"
12:47;12:49;"Wait, are we, we're about the same age roughly, right?"
12:49;12:50;"I think we talked about that last time"
12:50;12:53;"Like, we could never have been New Kid's fans"
12:53;12:54;"It was like, it was like"
12:54;12:57;"I mean, that was like, would have been an embarrassing thing to be"
12:57;13:01;"But see, that's what's weird, people forget that the New Kid's were actually tough"
13:01;13:02;"Hangin' Tough"
13:02;13:04;"Hangin' Tough was not just talk"
13:04;13:05;"No, they're"
13:05;13:06;"They actually hung tough"
13:06;13:07;"They really were, right"
13:07;13:11;"They were, they were, they were like, like street kids from Boston"
13:11;13:16;"And I was telling Despot, Joe, like the youngest kid"
13:16;13:17;"Yeah"
13:17;13:20;"He was like a really dope graffiti writer, he wrote Popeye"
13:20;13:21;"Whoa, that's actually"
13:21;13:22;"A real name"
13:22;13:24;"Popeye was his tag?"
13:24;13:25;"Yep"
13:25;13:26;"Damn"
13:26;13:29;"And he was up, like Arman Van Heldens from Boston"
13:29;13:30;"Oh, really?"
13:30;13:31;"Yeah, so he knew all those dudes"
13:31;13:33;"He was like writing with them back in the day?"
13:33;13:35;"Nah, but he knew them, like he was like, oh, those kids were real"
13:35;13:39;"And I mean, they were just gonna be like, they were gonna be like New Edition, you know"
13:39;13:41;"And there's like the famous Apollo"
13:41;13:45;"And that was the whole concept was that whoever kind of put it together was like, I want a white New Edition"
13:45;13:49;"Yeah, it's Maurice Starr, I believe the name is"
13:49;13:51;"The impresario and producer"
13:51;13:53;"Let's see how it sounds now"
13:53;13:54;"You gonna play it?"
13:54;13:55;"Maybe it's toughened up"
13:55;13:56;"Yeah, let's listen to"
13:56;13:58;"Here's Hangin' Tough by the white New Edition"
13:58;13:59;"Great"
13:59;14:19;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
14:19;14:25;"Listen up everybody if you wanna take a chance"
14:25;14:30;"Just get on the floor to the new kid's dance"
14:30;14:35;"Don't worry 'bout nothing 'cause it won't take long"
14:35;14:39;"We're gonna put you in a trance with our funky song"
14:39;14:40;"'Cause you gotta be"
14:40;14:49;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
14:49;14:51;"Are you tough enough?"
14:51;15:00;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:00;15:01;"We're up!"
15:01;15:12;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
15:12;15:17;"Everybody's always talking 'bout who's on top"
15:17;15:23;"Don't cross our path 'cause you're gonna get stuck"
15:23;15:28;"We ain't gonna give anybody any slack"
15:28;15:32;"And if you try to keep us down we're gonna come right back"
15:32;15:33;"And you know we're"
15:33;15:42;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:42;15:44;"Are you tough enough?"
15:44;15:53;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:53;15:54;"We're up!"
15:54;16:02;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
16:02;16:04;"You're listening to..."
16:04;16:08;"Time Crisis on BEATS 1"
16:08;16:10;"That was new kids on the block with ""Hangin' Tough."""
16:10;16:12;"I think that sounded pretty tough."
16:12;16:17;"Yeah, I remember this kid I knew in elementary school."
16:17;16:21;"It was one of those things that kids in school would sing"
16:21;16:24;"that was like a parody of a popular song at the time."
16:24;16:26;"And I remember instead of whatever,"
16:26;16:28;"like everybody's always talking about who's on top,"
16:28;16:32;"it was, ""If you wanna be stupid and you wanna wet your pants,"
16:32;16:35;"just get on the floor and do the new kids dance."""
16:35;16:38;"And then it was new kids suck instead of hangin' tough."
16:38;16:39;"It never ends."
16:39;16:40;"Yeah, man."
16:40;16:41;"So there were a lot of brothers,"
16:41;16:43;"brothers meaning two boys with the same parents,"
16:43;16:45;"in new kids on the block."
16:45;16:48;"But that got me thinking because it's Thanksgiving weekend,"
16:48;16:50;"so it's all about family"
16:50;16:53;"because that's a group that has Donnie Wahlberg,"
16:53;16:54;"who's brother's Mark Wahlberg,"
16:54;16:56;"then you got the Knight brothers."
16:56;16:59;"I don't know, Joey's probably their cousin or something."
16:59;17:00;"It's a real family group."
17:00;17:04;"So I thought maybe we'd talk a little bit about family"
17:04;17:05;"on today's Time Crisis."
17:05;17:07;"Maybe that'll be kind of the theme."
17:07;17:08;"Okay."
17:08;17:10;"All right, great."
17:10;17:12;"One thing I've always been curious about"
17:12;17:14;"is because I'm an older brother, I have a younger sister,"
17:14;17:16;"Emma, who's been on the show before."
17:16;17:17;"Huh, interesting."
17:17;17:20;"Yeah, Dave met her for the first time in L.A. last week."
17:20;17:23;"After how many years? 12 years?"
17:23;17:24;"I guess."
17:24;17:26;"Well, but here's the thing."
17:26;17:28;"Dave, your younger brother, A-Track,"
17:28;17:30;"is a world-famous DJ."
17:30;17:33;"You know, he's gonna be at Coachella."
17:33;17:35;"He's gonna be at Lollapalooza."
17:35;17:37;"But my sister doesn't do those things."
17:37;17:38;"She's never been to a festival."
17:38;17:41;"Yeah, but you met A-Track how many years into a friendship?"
17:41;17:42;"Two? Three?"
17:42;17:43;"Hard to say."
17:43;17:46;"But anyway, so I'm curious about this."
17:46;17:48;"What's it like having a brother?"
17:48;17:50;"'Cause you guys are both-- wait, are you an older brother?"
17:50;17:51;"I'm a younger brother."
17:51;17:52;"Oh."
17:52;17:54;"Yeah."
17:54;17:58;"What was going on in the Maklovich household?"
17:58;18:03;"Growing up, we're Montreal, Canada."
18:03;18:06;"We spoke French."
18:06;18:09;"So at home, like 1989,"
18:09;18:11;"New Kids on the Block are out."
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, one year before my bar mitzvah."
18:13;18:15;"Okay, so you're 12 years old."
18:15;18:17;"How old's A-Track?"
18:17;18:20;"He is gonna be 8."
18:20;18:22;"So the two of you guys are at home in Montreal, Canada,"
18:22;18:23;"just speaking French."
18:23;18:25;"Yeah, I'm 11."
18:25;18:28;"11, 12, we're at home speaking French."
18:28;18:31;"I'm rocking Ocean Pacific head to toe."
18:31;18:35;"You know, I've got a Vornay t-shirt"
18:35;18:38;"that my mom got on special somewhere."
18:38;18:42;"And I've got--"
18:42;18:45;"Actually, that year, so I couldn't--"
18:45;18:48;"my parents couldn't afford Nike Airs for us."
18:48;18:50;"Like, all my friends had them, like the Agassiz,"
18:50;18:52;"'cause like '89 probably, right?"
18:52;18:54;"So I remember wanting the Agassiz so bad,"
18:54;18:56;"""It's not gonna happen."""
18:56;19:01;"We had a cutoff of like $60 for sneakers."
19:01;19:03;"Couldn't get Nike Airs with that."
19:03;19:06;"Even in 1989, you couldn't buy Nike Airs for $60?"
19:06;19:07;"$60 is fair."
19:07;19:08;"Nah, dude."
19:08;19:10;"It was $80, it was $80."
19:10;19:12;"Jordans were over $100 already by then."
19:12;19:13;"They were like $100."
19:13;19:15;"Canadian dollars too, by the way."
19:15;19:16;"Pumps, forget about it."
19:16;19:17;"Pumps were mad expensive."
19:17;19:18;"Pumps were more expensive."
19:18;19:22;"And so--but Brooks, do you remember Brooks?"
19:22;19:24;"Yeah, the tennis shoe company."
19:24;19:27;"So they had for a very short time their own--"
19:27;19:30;"they were gonna have their own technological sneaker."
19:30;19:32;"And they were called the Brooks Hydro Flows."
19:32;19:36;"And my mom--I swear to God, Brooks Hydro Flows."
19:36;19:38;"I bet you we could find them."
19:38;19:41;"And my mom could afford those, so I was wearing"
19:41;19:45;"Brooks Hydro Flows and Ocean Pacific head to toe, basically."
19:45;19:46;"And that was the deal."
19:46;19:47;"That was me."
19:47;19:49;"Excuse me, aren't you Lavergne?"
19:49;19:51;"What are y'all doing here?"
21:30;21:32;"So was there hip-hop in the household?"
21:32;21:34;"No, this is--"
21:34;21:36;"""In the house"" is the proper way to say that."
21:36;21:37;"Was there hip-hop?"
21:37;21:39;"It wasn't even in the--yeah, it was--"
21:39;21:41;"no, there was no hip-hop in the house yet."
21:41;21:45;"Maybe I was already listening to like Hendrix and stuff like that."
21:45;21:47;"Or maybe, you know, stuff like probably that."
21:47;21:48;"Probably Hendrix and Led Zeppelin."
21:48;21:49;"Because yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
21:49;21:50;"This was that."
21:50;21:52;"It was like already--and I was collecting records already,"
21:52;21:55;"but I hadn't made the switch to hip-hop yet."
21:55;21:58;"Just listening to '70s music or rock or whatever."
21:58;22:00;"And then a couple years after that,"
22:00;22:04;"like basically that music basically led me to Cypress Hill"
22:04;22:06;"and like Beastie Boys, ""Check Your Head."""
22:06;22:11;"And then those were the gateways to like hip-hop, I guess."
22:11;22:14;"I mean, I'm sure you could relate to that."
22:14;22:17;"It's like you've got your gateway hip-hop groups."
22:17;22:20;"Very often it's like the Beasties or Cypress Hill or whatever."
22:20;22:23;"And then you get the one thing that you can kind of start doing."
22:23;22:25;"So my first thing was like, ""Oh, I'm going to write graffiti."""
22:25;22:29;"And then I had a band, and that was--"
22:29;22:32;"by mid-'90s, all the bands had like a DJ in them."
22:32;22:35;"It was like Acid Jazz, which is, by the way,"
22:35;22:37;"one of the dopest things to rediscover"
22:37;22:39;"if you're like, ""We should do an Acid Jazz playlist."""
22:39;22:41;"And like brand new heavies and stuff like that."
22:41;22:43;"They all had like a DJ scratching and stuff."
22:43;22:45;"And we had a DJ."
22:45;22:49;"By then I'm like 15 or whatever, so that's like 4 years later."
22:49;22:51;"I'm 15. I'm already kind of into hip-hop,"
22:51;22:54;"and we still have a band, and there's like MCs in there and everything."
22:54;22:57;"And we had a DJ, and he was terrible."
22:57;23:01;"And we were watching ""Wild Style"" all the time and stuff,"
23:01;23:03;"and I was like, ""Yo, it can't be that hard."
23:03;23:05;"Like really, this guy just sucks."""
23:05;23:08;"So I told my brother, ""Why don't you try it?"
23:08;23:11;"You're at home watching The Simpsons just doing nothing."""
23:11;23:13;"- And what, he was like 11? - He was 11, yeah."
23:13;23:15;"- He's basically like a little kid. - A child."
23:15;23:17;"And I was like, ""You're doing nothing."
23:17;23:19;"You're just like here watching us."""
23:19;23:21;"Basically when you're 11 and you've got an older brother,"
23:21;23:23;"you're like a stan."
23:23;23:26;"You're just like watching them, like in awe of everything you do."
23:26;23:28;"Like I'm writing graffiti, he's writing--"
23:28;23:31;"It's like the Borat thing, like I have a radio with a clock, he has a radio."
23:31;23:34;"Like he just does--trolls everything you do."
23:34;23:36;"So I was like, ""Look, stop just doing everything"
23:36;23:39;"and just following me silently everywhere,"
23:39;23:42;"and try your own thing, like try scratching."""
23:42;23:46;"And basically my brother took the turntable that was at the house"
23:46;23:49;"and started scratching on it"
23:49;23:52;"on this one record that had an acapella."
23:52;23:57;"It was the Beastie Boys' 45 for ""Fruit Loop,"""
23:57;24:00;"and it had an acapella section on it, and he started scratching."
24:00;24:02;"And he was already better than the guy that was scratching"
24:02;24:05;"in our high school acid jazz band."
24:05;24:08;"- Imagine that. - Imagine."
24:08;24:10;"So I was like, ""Dude, you should really do this."""
24:10;24:13;"And my brother was like, ""Okay, I got nothing going on."""
24:13;24:17;"And that's how it started. It was like that."

28:17;28:19;"Another thing that I've always found interesting,"
28:19;28:21;"like hearing you talk about growing up,"
28:21;28:23;"is that I think for a lot of people today,"
28:23;28:25;"Canada,"
28:25;28:27;"because of Drake and Weeknd and other people,"
28:27;28:29;"in terms of like cool hip hop and R&B,"
28:29;28:31;"it's like a major player."
28:31;28:33;"It was not like that."
28:33;28:35;"It's honestly hard to imagine that there was a time like,"
28:35;28:37;"when you were living in Montreal, like, it was almost like a backwater."
28:37;28:39;"Yes."
28:39;28:41;"Like, there wasn't even a hip hop record store."
28:41;28:43;"No, there were like two."
28:43;28:45;"No, there were."
28:45;28:47;"It was probably like,"
28:47;28:49;"I don't know, like a small US town,"
28:49;28:51;"where you have like your one mom and pop store."
28:51;28:53;"It's not that you didn't have access to hip hop,"
28:53;28:55;"or like cool sneakers,"
28:55;28:57;"but there was no sense of Canadian hip hop."
28:57;28:59;"Just couldn't afford it."
28:59;29:01;"There's no sense of Canadian hip hop identity."
29:01;29:03;"Well, they were trying to do it,"
29:03;29:05;"and it was all like Toronto guys."
29:05;29:07;"What year are we talking now?"
29:07;29:09;"Well, now we're like fast forwarding."
29:09;29:11;"Early 90s?"
29:11;29:13;"No, like early 90s,"
29:13;29:15;"early 90s was still like"
29:15;29:17;"fluke Canadian hip hop artists,"
29:17;29:19;"like remember Maestro, right?"
29:19;29:21;"Yeah."
29:21;29:23;"Yeah, so like Maestro, Fresh Wes,"
29:23;29:25;"this guy who came out of nowhere,"
29:25;29:27;"and then got sort of put on by Showbiz,"
29:27;29:29;"and AG, like the Showbiz,"
29:29;29:31;"who's like a really famous New York hip hop producer,"
29:31;29:33;"Seminole."
29:33;29:35;"So he had Cred."
29:35;29:37;"Or was that, or Snow, I think,"
29:37;29:39;"I feel like Snow was down with those guys."
29:39;29:41;"Oh, like Informer?"
29:41;29:43;"Yeah, Snow was definitely Canadian."
29:43;29:45;"Maybe it was Snow that was down with Showbiz."
29:45;29:47;"Wait, who was it?"
29:47;29:49;"Snow had, who was rapping on Informer?"
29:49;29:51;"No."
29:51;29:53;"No, but wasn't there like a guy,"
29:53;29:55;"I feel like he had"
29:55;29:57;"some legendary rap guy on there."
29:57;29:59;"Let's see."
29:59;30:01;"Informer still, I mean, you can't do karaoke"
30:01;30:03;"without doing that one, right?"
30:03;30:05;"Yeah, I know all the words to Informer."
30:05;30:07;"We gotta listen to Informer."
30:07;30:09;"Which is a song about a snitch."
30:09;30:11;"I love that. It's a song about snitches."
30:11;30:13;"Well, you know, the tough thing is that,"
30:13;30:15;"because nobody knows what he says after Informer,"
30:15;30:17;"so what's he talking about?"
30:17;30:19;"What's he going to do to the Informer?"
30:19;30:21;"I know."
30:21;30:23;"MC Shan, that's who it was."
30:23;30:25;"Oh, that's right."
30:25;30:27;"So Maestro was down with Showbiz, I think,"
30:27;30:29;"and Snow was down with Shan."
30:29;30:31;"And Shan produced Informer."
30:31;30:33;"That's crazy."
30:33;30:35;"Alright, let's listen to Informer by Snow"
30:35;30:37;"from the Seminole album 12 Inches of Snow."
30:37;30:39;"Which is so smart."
30:39;30:41;"The 12 Inch, you know what I mean?"
30:41;30:43;"Like, it's so smart. It's so dope."
30:43;30:45;"Let's bust it."
34:38;34:57;"- That was ""Snow"" with Informer,"
34:57;34:59;"a beautiful Canadian dance hall single"
34:59;35:01;"from the early 90s."
35:01;35:02;"This is weird, we got a phone in the studio"
35:02;35:04;"that we've never used before"
35:04;35:06;"and it just started ringing."
35:06;35:07;"This is kind of like the bat phone over here"
35:07;35:09;"in the Apple New York office,"
35:09;35:11;"so let's see who it is."
35:11;35:13;"Could be important."
35:13;35:14;"Hello?"
35:14;35:16;"- Hi there, this is Tim Cook,"
35:16;35:19;"Chief Executive Officer of Apple."
35:19;35:20;"- Oh, are you serious?"
35:20;35:22;"Mr. Cook, thank you-- - Yes, Tim Cook."
35:22;35:24;"- Mr. Cook, thank you for calling in."
35:24;35:26;"- I'm calling you from Apple HQ"
35:26;35:29;"in sunny Cupertino, California."
35:29;35:30;"What's percolating?"
35:30;35:34;"- Oh, well, first of all, can I say that it's a real honor?"
35:34;35:35;"I mean, I was talking to Zane the other day."
35:35;35:38;"He said you don't check in too often on the shows,"
35:38;35:40;"but this is pretty cool."
35:40;35:42;"I'm here in New York."
35:42;35:43;"I've got Dave Maklovich from Chromio"
35:43;35:45;"and Despot in the room."
35:45;35:47;"Guys, this is Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple."
35:47;35:48;"- Hi, Tim. - Hi, Tim."
35:48;35:50;"- What's going on, guys?"
35:50;35:52;"I'm actually calling you from a prototype"
35:52;35:53;"of the iPhone 7."
35:53;35:55;"What a time to be alive."
35:55;35:56;"(laughing)"
35:56;35:57;"- Oh, wow, it sounds great."
35:57;36:01;"- Anyway, listen, I'm not gonna beat around the bush here."
36:01;36:03;"I just wanted to personally thank you"
36:03;36:08;"and Azra for 11 great episodes of ""Time Crisis."""
36:08;36:09;"Your involvement in Beats 1,"
36:09;36:13;"it's really raised Apple's indie rock credibility,"
36:13;36:16;"and I just wanna thank you for your service."
36:16;36:19;"It's been really great, but unfortunately,"
36:19;36:24;"like the original iPod, all things must come to an end,"
36:24;36:26;"and so it's with mixed emotions here"
36:26;36:28;"that I'm announcing that actually"
36:28;36:31;"this is the final episode of ""Time Crisis."""
36:31;36:33;"- Are you serious?"
36:33;36:35;"- Yeah, it's been a great run,"
36:35;36:38;"but we've got a really exciting deal in place"
36:38;36:40;"with Jerry Seinfeld, actually,"
36:40;36:43;"to bring some all-new audio episodes of Seinfeld"
36:43;36:45;"over to Beats 1 in this time slot."
36:45;36:48;"- This isn't Tim Cook, is it?"
36:48;36:51;"- Yeah, the show is called ""New Seinfeld,"""
36:51;36:53;"and it's gonna be hosted by one of the most exciting"
36:53;36:56;"people on the internet, the Fat Jew."
36:56;36:59;"- Okay, okay, who is this?"
36:59;37:00;"This is obviously not Tim Cook."
37:00;37:03;"You're not bringing Seinfeld onto Apple Radio."
37:03;37:05;"- Yeah, it's Seinfeld 2000."
37:05;37:07;"- Okay, cut him, cut him."
37:13;37:28;"I wanna sincerely apologize to everybody listening at home,"
37:28;37:32;"and of course, to the real Tim Cook, CEO of Apple."
37:32;37:35;"I was again humiliated by a truly wicked,"
37:35;37:38;"vile person, Seinfeld 2000."
37:38;37:42;"Dave and Despot, I'm sorry that you guys had to see"
37:42;37:44;"your good friend get sunned like that."
37:44;37:47;"- Yeah, it's a weird turnoff, right?"
37:47;37:47;"- It's hard to watch."
37:47;37:50;"- It's hard. - I feel embarrassed for you."
37:50;37:53;"- Well, let's get back into some music."
37:53;37:56;"Every time that goddamned asshole calls in,"
37:56;38:00;"I need to play something kinda happy to take the edge off."
38:00;38:02;"When I did that, Dave, because you were coming in,"
38:02;38:06;"I thought, a lot of people know the big Chromio songs,"
38:06;38:11;"the classics, Needy Girl, Jealous, Tenderoni,"
38:11;38:13;"but because I am literally a day one,"
38:13;38:16;"at least a day one New York fan of Chromio,"
38:16;38:19;"I know some of the songs that maybe"
38:19;38:20;"the fair weather fans don't know as well."
38:20;38:21;"- You know the deep cuts."
38:21;38:23;"- I know the deep cuts, so I thought maybe,"
38:23;38:24;"this'll put me in a good mood"
38:24;38:26;"after that disgusting incident,"
38:26;38:30;"I thought I'd play a couple of my favorite Chromio songs"
38:30;38:32;"that maybe the people at home don't know as well."
38:32;38:32;"- Cool."
38:32;38:34;"- And this has always been one of my favorites"
38:34;38:35;"'cause this is a very different side of Chromio"
38:35;38:38;"and it's in French, you know what song I'm talking about."
38:38;38:39;"What's it called?"
38:39;38:39;"- Je claque la porte."
38:39;38:40;"- Je claque la porte."
38:40;38:42;"What does that mean? - I slam the door."
38:42;38:44;"- I slam, so claque means slam?"
38:44;38:45;"- Yes. - Okay."
38:45;38:48;"So here, is this, this is one of the only"
38:48;38:50;"Chromio songs in French."
38:50;38:52;"- It's the only Chromio song in French"
38:52;38:57;"and it's from our dark, more broody album."
38:57;39:00;"You know, the sort of,"
39:00;39:02;"it was almost like a sophomore album"
39:02;39:03;"but it was our third album."
39:03;39:06;"- Yeah, let's check it out, Chromio, Je claque la porte."
39:06;39:08;"- You don't have to play that right now."
39:08;39:10;"(laughing)"

41:28;41:29;"I believe you played this next song"
41:29;41:32;"when I saw you guys open for the streets back in the day."
41:32;41:35;"This is one, a little feature for P Thug,"
41:35;41:36;"who's not with us today."
41:36;41:36;"- Yeah."
41:36;41:37;"- Your partner in crime, Patrick."
41:37;41:38;"- That's right, that's right."
41:38;41:40;"- And this song is also kind of"
41:40;41:41;"on the emo side of ""Cromier."""
41:41;41:42;"- ""Mercury Tears."""
41:42;41:43;"- Yes."
41:43;41:44;"- Yeah."
41:44;41:46;"- This is, see to me this is like,"
41:46;41:48;"to me this is like classic ""Cromier."""
41:48;41:50;"- Yeah, actually it's not P, it's me on there."
41:50;41:51;"- Oh, that's you singing?"
41:51;41:52;"- Yeah, auto-tuned."
41:52;41:53;"- Wait, really?"
41:53;41:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
41:54;41:55;"- It was auto-tuned back then?"
41:55;41:56;"So this is ""Cromier."""
41:56;41:58;"- Actually, no, no, no, no, no, it's not true."
41:58;42:00;"That is, we had auto-tune on that album,"
42:00;42:02;"but that was through a voc order."
42:02;42:03;"- Okay, yeah, it sounds more like a voc order."
42:03;42:04;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
42:04;42:05;"- So this is from the first ""Cromier"" album."
42:05;42:07;"- That's the first ""Cromier"" song we ever wrote."
42:07;42:08;"- Oh, really?"
42:08;42:09;"- Yes."
42:09;42:10;"- So yeah, it's called ""Mercury Tears."""
42:10;42:12;"It's like, it's kind of got like to fun,"
42:12;42:13;"it's kind of 80s, but then it's actually--"
42:13;42:14;"- Electro-y."
42:14;42:17;"- But then it's a deeply melancholic song."
42:17;42:18;"- Deeply melancholic song,"
42:18;42:21;"and the melody is jacked from"
42:21;42:25;"♪ Joe, I wanna know what turns you on ♪"
42:25;42:26;"And yeah, so,"

42:33;42:35;"- That was the first song we ever wrote."
42:35;42:37;"And the intro, we added the intro later."
42:37;42:39;"That was P, the Baroque intro."
42:39;42:41;"- That was P."
42:41;42:43;"- And then the rest was just the way it was."

46:35;46:43;"- I wanna thank you guys for coming to my Thanksgiving."
46:43;46:45;"- Oh yeah. - Oh yeah, that was great."
46:45;46:48;"- That was a really beautiful day."
46:48;46:50;"This is the second Thanksgiving"
46:50;46:52;"that Dave and I have spent together."
46:52;46:54;"Last Thanksgiving was one of my favorites of all time"
46:54;46:56;"'cause it was super random."
46:56;46:58;"It was me, my parents, and Dave."
46:58;47:00;"Just the four of us at a restaurant."
47:00;47:01;"- That's right. - And it was tight."
47:01;47:04;"We just did the kind of like bougie pre-feeks."
47:04;47:07;"You know, you get a piece of turkey or whatever."
47:07;47:09;"But you know, that was kind of better"
47:09;47:13;"than driving down to Grandma's nursing home."
47:13;47:16;"- It was nice of you guys 'cause I'm Canadian,"
47:16;47:18;"so I don't have any friends on Thanksgiving"
47:18;47:20;"and I don't know what it is."
47:20;47:22;"- Right, so what's the story with Canadian Thanksgiving?"
47:22;47:24;"- 'Cause in French Canada, they don't do that one either."
47:24;47:26;"Nobody honors it, nobody cares."
47:26;47:28;"- 'Cause that's considered some like Anglo sh--?"
47:28;47:30;"- Yeah, so I never knew."
47:30;47:31;"I never understood the Canadian one"
47:31;47:33;"and much less the American one."
47:33;47:35;"- I don't understand the American one."
47:35;47:36;"- Wait, so-- - Well said."
47:36;47:39;"- Wait, so Alex, obviously we're very thrilled"
47:39;47:41;"to have you at our Thanksgiving."
47:41;47:43;"What's like your typical Thanksgiving's been like"
47:43;47:44;"in years past? - Mine?"
47:44;47:46;"- Yeah. - We would--"
47:46;47:48;"there's a bigger table that we have."
47:48;47:50;"We'd take the big table out"
47:50;47:52;"and unfold the big table."
47:52;47:53;"- Mom and Dad?"
47:53;47:56;"- Mom and Dad would unfold the big table"
47:56;47:58;"and then make a turkey"
47:58;48:01;"and my mom makes these like sweet carrots"
48:01;48:02;"that are pretty good"
48:02;48:06;"and, you know, make all your traditional Thanksgiving dishes"
48:06;48:08;"and then we would invite all the people"
48:08;48:10;"who I used to call uncle growing up,"
48:10;48:12;"but none of them were my uncle."
48:12;48:14;"- What were they? Cousin brothers?"
48:14;48:15;"- I guess like my dad's friends"
48:15;48:17;"and my mom's friends. - Oh, just friends."
48:17;48:19;"- Yeah, and now they're pretty much--"
48:19;48:21;"most of them are not around anymore,"
48:21;48:23;"so we don't do anything."
48:23;48:25;"- Just take it real easy. - Yeah."
48:25;48:27;"Still cook a turkey once in a while."
48:27;48:29;"I think last year there was a turkey."
48:29;48:31;"- And you guys are Jewish, right?"
48:31;48:33;"- Yeah, we're Jewish. Through and through."
48:33;48:35;"- I was asking your parents last night,"
48:35;48:36;"basically in America,"
48:36;48:38;"Jews do Thanksgiving just like everyone else."
48:38;48:39;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, no."
48:39;48:42;"Jews love Thanksgiving because it's like Christmas"
48:42;48:43;"for Jewish people."
48:43;48:44;"- And then on Christmas,"
48:44;48:45;"they're having Chinese food anyway."
48:45;48:47;"- Yeah, on Christmas you have to have Chinese food, so."
48:47;48:48;"- Have to."
48:48;48:49;"- What? - Should we--"
48:49;48:51;"[laughter]"
48:51;48:54;"- I was thinking maybe I'll keep it on the family tip"
48:54;48:56;"'cause Thanksgiving is about relationships"
48:56;48:58;"and family and friends and things like that."

54:46;54:47;"But we're talking about family,"
54:47;54:49;"and you know what, just because people get divorced,"
54:49;54:50;"it doesn't mean they can't break bread together"
54:50;54:51;"at Thanksgiving."
54:51;54:52;"- Oh, is that what happens?"
54:52;54:55;"- Well, and I was just thinking about, like, family stuff."
54:55;54:58;"This is a--you know, some people can't."
54:58;54:59;"- You mean, like, the divorced parents"
54:59;55:01;"will get back together for dinner?"
55:01;55:02;"Is that what you're saying?"
55:02;55:04;"- I mean, sometimes people get so cool"
55:04;55:09;"that it'll be mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom,"
55:09;55:10;"all breaking bread together."
55:10;55:12;"- That's an R. Kelly song."
55:12;55:14;"That is an R. Kelly song right there."
55:14;55:16;"- I'm not down for that. - No."
55:16;55:20;"- If I was the stepdad or the original dad,"
55:20;55:22;"I wouldn't--no. - No."
55:22;55:23;"- You could come to-- - Really?"
55:23;55:25;"- You could come to me and your stepmom's house"
55:25;55:27;"the day after or the day before."
55:27;55:28;"- Get leftovers. - You know."
55:28;55:30;"- You wouldn't break bread with your ex-wife"
55:30;55:31;"and her new husband?"
55:31;55:32;"- No, man, that'd be a fight."
55:32;55:34;"- And her new jacked bodybuilder husband?"
55:34;55:36;"- Goy. - I would be--"
55:36;55:38;"- Her new Goy jacked husband."
55:38;55:40;"- I have no problem--see, when I was younger,"
55:40;55:43;"I used to always--I used to always imagine"
55:43;55:45;"if I ever, like, had children and got divorced,"
55:45;55:49;"probably the worst part would be the stepdad situation."
55:49;55:50;"- Yeah. - Would be to have"
55:50;55:53;"your children being raised by, like, a bodybuilder."
55:53;55:55;"But then the more I thought about it, I was like,"
55:55;55:56;"""Oh, you know, that's just, like, selfish."
55:56;55:57;"""Like, you should probably give--"
55:57;55:58;"""you should give him a chance."
55:58;56:00;"""Like, he's probably cool."""
56:00;56:01;"- I mean, he probably also, you know,"
56:01;56:03;"would be, like, a pretty regimented lifestyle."
56:03;56:06;"He's used to, like, eating right and, you know,"
56:06;56:08;"waking up at this time and working out."
56:08;56:09;"He'd keep your kids in line."
56:09;56:10;"- Yeah, and then they like him--"
56:10;56:12;"they like him more than they like you."
56:12;56:13;"- Well, no, it's different."
56:13;56:14;"- You're, like, a deadbeat schmuck."
56:14;56:16;"- Yeah, you can't even beat him up."
56:16;56:17;"You can't beat him up."
56:17;56:18;"- You can't beat him up, 'cause then he's like,"
56:18;56:19;"""Don't touch my kids."""
56:19;56:21;"And you're like, ""They're my kids."""
56:21;56:22;"- Yeah, but-- - Then he just, like,"
56:22;56:23;"slaps you. - Yeah."
56:23;56:24;"- You fall and you cry."
56:24;56:26;"- No, but you want to be cool with that guy."
56:26;56:28;"And also, first of all, because at his household,"
56:28;56:30;"there's the constant-- - I don't want to be cool"
56:30;56:31;"with that guy. - He's always making--"
56:31;56:32;"he's always making the kids work out,"
56:32;56:34;"and he's always making them eat the high-protein diet."
56:34;56:37;"Then when they come over to your house every other weekend,"
56:37;56:38;"you know, then you can break out--"
56:38;56:39;"- That's true. They love me."
56:39;56:41;"- The carbohydrates. - Yeah, here's some donuts, kids."
56:41;56:44;"- I'm carb daddy. - Carb daddy."
56:44;56:45;"That's right. - Carb daddy."
56:45;56:47;"- I like to think of myself as a bodybuilder,"
56:47;56:48;"though, so I can't really imagine myself--"
56:48;56:50;"- That's true. You're getting pretty jacked right now."
56:50;56:51;"- I'm very strong. I'm, like--"
56:51;56:53;"- Okay, wait, can we talk about something for a second?"
56:53;56:54;"- I don't know. - We should talk about"
56:54;56:58;"somebody who's been on this show before a lot."
56:58;57:00;"We should have him on again soon."
57:00;57:03;"But everybody's talking about how our good friend Makonnen"
57:03;57:05;"is, like, ripped now. - He's looking good."
57:05;57:07;"- He's amazing. - Yeah, he's doing his thing."
57:07;57:10;"- How much weight did he lose? - I don't know, but a lot."
57:10;57:11;"We talked about it in the beginning"
57:11;57:14;"when I started doing my, like, serious workout thing."
57:14;57:15;"- Yeah. - He was like, ""Oh, you too?"""
57:15;57:17;"And I was like, ""What do you mean, man?"""
57:17;57:20;"And he was like, ""Yeah, I'm working out all the time too."""
57:20;57:22;"And at that time, I guess, you know,"
57:22;57:24;"he was in the early stages, and I was looking at him,"
57:24;57:27;"and I was like, ""You're not working out all the time."""
57:27;57:28;"- Yeah. - You know, whatever."
57:28;57:30;"- But there's a tipping point."
57:30;57:32;"- I mean, within maybe two weeks."
57:32;57:33;"- But, you know, if you work out hard enough,"
57:33;57:34;"you can eat whatever you want."
57:34;57:36;"- I eat whatever I want. - Huh."
57:36;57:37;"- You should see these abs."
57:37;57:40;"- You can. - On Instagram."
57:40;57:43;"If you want to see some washboard abs,"
57:43;57:45;"go to @despotroast on Instagram."
57:45;57:47;"- You know, I should maybe post a new one, though,"
57:47;57:50;"'cause that's old, and, you know, my results, as they say."
57:50;57:52;"- You should do a big-- you should do--"
57:52;57:53;"- A lot better. - Oh, you know,"
57:53;57:54;"you also got to do a side-by-side"

57:55;57:58;"- Well, I was gonna do that, but my phone"
57:58;58:01;"that had my before pictures on it broke,"
58:01;58:03;"and I didn't have it backed up, so--"
58:03;58:05;"and I don't trust the cloud."
58:05;58:07;"- All right, well... - No offense."
58:07;58:09;"- Never trust the cloud. - That's no fun for the fans."
58:09;58:11;"Well, anyway, we haven't played any ""Makonnen"""
58:11;58:13;"on this show in a while, so we want to say"
58:13;58:14;"shout-out to ""Makonnen,"" because"

58:22;58:24;"- Right. Do that. - Do that."
58:24;58:25;"And as long as you're achieving that,"
58:25;58:28;"then we're thrilled for you, and you look great"
58:28;58:30;"as long as you feel happy."
58:30;58:32;"And ""Makonnen"" seems happy, so..."
58:32;58:34;"- You're a beautiful man, ""Makonnen."""
58:34;58:36;"You should play ""Second Chance,"""

01:01:25;01:01:27;"All this talk about Makonnen really,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I've been talking, like, all this game my whole life"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"about getting jacked."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Mm."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"I've never even come close."
01:01:32;01:01:35;"I could give you my Beachbody.com password if you want."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Really? I'd appreciate that."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Actually, I'm very inspired by Makonnen."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"And again, it's not that I don't hate my body."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"I just want to know what it's like to be, like, jacked."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"It's amazing."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"Is it?"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"How has your life changed since you've been jacked?"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"I'm just a lot stronger."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"You know, you just walk around feeling strong."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"It's a great feeling."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"My posture's better."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"Yeah."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"I feel like I could punch anyone's head off."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"I think that's the best part."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"That's a great thing."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"Wait, Dave, have you ever been jacked?"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"Never been jacked."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"I'm also not jacked."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"You're kind of jacked. I mean..."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"I look good with my shirt off."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"That's all I want."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I'll give myself that."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"See, because Makonnen's been performing with his shirt off."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"That's why everybody's talking."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Yeah, the shirt's been off."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"He can't keep his shirt on."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Yeah, but you know what?"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"If you got it, flaunt it."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"I mean, I want to do that one day."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"I think."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Although then would I have to, like, manscape?"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Yeah, you might."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"Not necessarily."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"It depends what you're going for."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"But yeah, I definitely feel like latter day vampire weekend needs no shirt."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"I mean, like when you do the Jersey album."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Right."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Like, Taylor Castor."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Yeah, Bruce got jacked for Born in the USA."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"That's right."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"And that was a game changer for him."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Game changer."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"Yeah."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"You explain that to me."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"Yeah, because people think of that as like this artistic change."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"But the funny thing is, like, first and foremost, it was a body change."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"A-Trak tells me in L.A. they call it a body transformation."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"Like, ""Oh, are you doing a body transformation?"""
01:02:55;01:02:56;"Like, they say that super seriously."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"Oh, like it's a thing."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Well, Harley, your boy."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Oh, the trainer."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Yeah."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"Oh, he's like, so..."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"That's one of his things."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Like, ""So are we doing a body transformation here?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"Okay, great."""
01:03:07;01:03:08;"And then it becomes a narrative."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Right."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"Like, Chris Pratt, it was a narrative that he got jacked and now he's a movie star."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Right."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"Yeah, I mean, it's not a bad narrative."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"We're coming up on--it's the holiday season."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"We're coming up on New Year's, and you know what people say a lot when it's New Year's?"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"""New year, new me."""
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Man."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"And that's often about body transformation."
01:03:25;01:03:30;"I think you're putting yourself--I think you're setting yourself up and you're talking about"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"this with your fans right now and all your online community is listening."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"True."
01:03:35;01:03:38;"I think we should just--I think we should create a hashtag right now, #NewEzra."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Yeah, you've got--"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"#NewEzra."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Yeah, #NewEzra, #NewEzraBod."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"I don't know how you guys feel about this."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Yeah, this is probably going to go about as well as #NewCoke."
01:03:45;01:03:48;"[laughter]"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"Which is a reference not everybody's going to get, but you can Google it."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"You have no interest in being jacked, right, Div?"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"It's not like a friend thing that we could do, like we both try to get jacked together?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"I feel like that wasn't a nice thing to say."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"That wasn't a nice assumption to make."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"I didn't take it wrong."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"I'm okay."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"You clearly are not interested in being very strong."
01:04:07;01:04:11;"Well, here's the thing is I don't see it as a strength thing."
01:04:11;01:04:16;"I mean the strength thing--like the strength thing is like sort of an ancillary benefit, you know?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"It's just aesthetics, right?"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"I mean you don't really have to--"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"You don't have to get strong."
01:04:21;01:04:24;"You don't have to really--I mean it's just--I think it's just a looks thing."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"And if you're stronger than great, you know, but I mean core strength you can do--"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"I mean you've got people that got crazy core strength and they don't look--"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"they don't have the ripped thing, right?"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"That's true."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"We're just really talking about being able to play with our shirts off."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"And I think as--"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Purely aesthetic."
01:04:39;01:04:43;"And I think, I mean, you know, I think if you're going to do it and you want to--"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"I mean if you want to do like a coordinated body transformation,"
01:04:47;01:04:51;"I think we could talk about that if the hashtag is right."
01:04:51;01:04:55;"All right. Let's think about that hashtag and in the meantime--"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Well, for now it's the one about you."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"New Ezra."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"And then New Dave."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"It's a little long."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"New Ezra. New Dave."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Let's think about it."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"2016 is going to be an interesting year."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"And here's a woman who knows a thing or two about transformation,"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"Annie Lennox with ""Walking on Broken Glass."""

01:09:10;01:09:12;"working on broken glass for Horchata."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"- You told me that."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"- No, I said I liked that song."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"- No, it was deliberate, I remember this."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"- No."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"- Okay."

01:09:20;01:09:21;"- So to segue."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"- I said I like that song."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"I think at the time when Horchata came out,"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"a lot of people thought it sounded more like Coldplay."

01:09:35;01:09:37;"- The thing about Horchata and Working on Broken Glass"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"is that they both low key have like a salsa feel."

01:10:10;01:10:12;"I used to want to be like Razzel."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"- Oh wow, amazing."
01:10:14;01:10:17;"- Which some of the younger kids might not know about."
01:10:17;01:10:17;"(barking)"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"I don't even want to try."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"- Do it, do it."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"(laughing)"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"- I want to be like, what's something that he might scratch?"
01:10:23;01:10:26;"- I would be like Razzel, Godfather of Noise."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"(barking)"
01:10:27;01:10:28;"- That just sounds like a dog."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"Or he could also, I used to be able to do that thing"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"where you do robot voice like,"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"""Mm, you are now."""
01:10:33;01:10:34;"- Oh wow."
01:10:34;01:10:34;"- I don't think I can do it anymore."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"""Mm, you are now listening to the incredible."""
01:10:36;01:10:40;"Nah, I lost like that, it's from singing falsetto"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"all these years, I can't do it anymore."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"I used to be able to do,"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"he used to do the throat singing thing."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"""Mm, you are now listening."""
01:10:45;01:10:46;"I lost it."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Let's listen to something from Razzel."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"- Damn shame."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"- That's a good attempt."

01:15:28;01:15:29;"Anyway, thanks Dave for coming."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"- All right."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"- I know it's put a real strain on our friendship"
01:15:31;01:15:34;"that you haven't been on for the first 10 episodes,"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"but you're gonna be coming back more often."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"- Yeah, I mean, we got it on paper now, right?"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"- There's a schedule and there's an agreement"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"and your lawyer talked to my lawyer."

01:15:52;01:15:53;"about to reenter the building."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"A throwback to the first episode of Time Crisis."
01:15:56;01:15:59;"In the meantime, here's the Desus and Mero chain"
01:15:59;01:16:00;"just like honey."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"(electronic music)"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"(rock music)"
01:16:10;01:16:24;"Listen to the girl as she takes on half the world Moving up and so alive in the honey dripping"

01:18:47;01:18:51;"That was Jesus and Mary Chain with Just Like Honey"
01:18:51;01:18:55;"And now we're joined by two men who are on the very first episode of Time Crisis"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"We've been waiting a long time to have them back"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"We're talking about the Bodega Boys themselves"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Jesus and Mary"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"Gentlemen, please introduce yourselves"
01:19:03;01:19:07;"Yo, what's good man, it's the Kid Mero, aka the human durag flap, you know what I'm saying, aka Curve Gotti"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"AKA I don't talk to police in any circumstances"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"Woo, it's lit, and it's your boy Jesus Nice, aka Young Chipotle"
01:19:13;01:19:18;"AKA Pockets stay fat like cereal, aka Mr. 1990, I don't know how old you are"
01:19:18;01:19:22;"I feel like a lot's changed since you first came on the show 10 episodes ago"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"Well for one thing, I don't think Bodega Boys existed yet"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"No"
01:19:26;01:19:30;"Okay, so first of all, for anybody who doesn't know, maybe you know Jesus and Mero from Twitter"
01:19:30;01:19:34;"Maybe you remember Jesus vs. Mero, which was the original podcast"
01:19:34;01:19:38;"But now, and I would say this is literally the best podcast around"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"Hey, thank you man, that's very good"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"And I'm not blowing smoke"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"He's not gassing us"
01:19:44;01:19:49;"It's called Bodega Boys, that's the new podcast that you guys have, that you record at Red Bull"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"Record at Red Bull, available on iTunes"
01:19:51;01:19:56;"Any other podcast plan, you might be able to hear it coming out of CRX on your block"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"You know what I mean?"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"It's very lit"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"It's getting up there"
01:20:00;01:20:07;"It's getting up there on the charts too, because if you go to comedy, which is probably the most competitive podcast chart"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"I feel like it's in the 20s"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I want to say everybody, we gotta get this top 10"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"We're trying"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"How do you get it top 10? Is it like the more you listen to it?"
01:20:15;01:20:18;"The more people subscribe and listen and raise it"
01:20:18;01:20:21;"So even if you don't want to listen to it, subscribe"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Yeah, just subscribe and delete it"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"And if you are going to listen, you should just play it on loop while you sleep, when you sound off"
01:20:27;01:20:30;"Jump in, jump in, jump in, them boys up to something"

01:23:30;01:23:32;"So, we're very happy to have you guys back in the holiday season"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"It's good to be back, man, it's very beautiful"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Congrats to you and your show, man"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Oh, thank you"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"You know what I'm saying? We're out here"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"This is crazy, this is like mad New York, you know what I'm saying?"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"There's mad buildings and lights, y'all don't know about that"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"You know we're on radio, right?"
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Yeah, they can't see us"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"They can't see me, but I'm like, ""Yo, what's your show?"""
01:23:44;01:23:47;"Like I said, I'm taking you there, I'm like the Nas of radio"
01:23:47;01:23:51;"We should tell everybody that we're on a high floor of a beautiful building"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"It's mad nice out here"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"So, what's Thanksgiving like for you guys?"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"Oh, Thanksgiving, a day to stuff your face"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"Yeah, you eat so much that it hurts, you physically, you know what I'm saying?"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"Like you're not supposed to do that"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"You could be a glutton and it's socially acceptable"
01:24:03;01:24:06;"Like any other day of the year, if you made yourself a plate of food"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"The size of the plate of food you make on Thanksgiving"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"People would send you to rehab because clearly you have an eating disorder"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"You'd be on TLC on some wild reality show"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"You could drink gravy out of a cup on Thanksgiving and no one would bat an eye"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"It's the most American of holidays"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"That's true, everybody gets to celebrate it"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"And you see people you haven't seen in a mad long, you know what I mean?"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"That you might, may or may not actually f*** with on a regular basis"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"That you have to see because they're family"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"But just because you're family doesn't mean you rock with them"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"Like you might see your cousin that blocked you on Facebook"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"You might see your aunt that's still sending you candy crush invites"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"You know, you might have to explain to your aunt"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"You got your new girlfriend and she's like, ""What happened to the old one I liked her better?"""
01:24:43;01:24:45;"And she says it out loud in front of her, you know?"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"DT and Van always does that"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Always"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"""Oh, I like Julia better"""
01:24:50;01:24:54;"""She was more nicer, she went to school, she had the certificate from a role, she was a flambotomist"""
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Your last girlfriend was cuter"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"How old are you? You look older than that"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"You have old skin"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"You got old skin?"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Your DT would tell your girl she got old skin in her back"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"Straight up"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Don't even blink"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"Straight up"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"And then throw the Stevie B on a CD changer"
01:25:08;01:25:11;"So guys, we've been in LA for Time Crisis a lot"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"But it's good to be back in New York"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Because we kicked off a segment last time you guys were on"
01:25:15;01:25:18;"And that was one that we like to call New York News"
01:25:18;01:25:22;"This is New York News"
01:25:22;01:25:26;"Things got really fancy since the first episode"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"It was like a Michael Bay sound effect"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Our producers printed us out a bunch of news"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"I haven't really looked at them too much yet"
01:25:33;01:25:37;"But I figured, who better to comment on New York News than Desus Merrow and Despot"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"As local as local news gets"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"It's pretty local"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"You know, New York News is always a little bit international"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"So the first one is"
01:25:45;01:25:48;"Mafia will take on ISIS if terrorists launch attack on New York"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"Mobster's son claims"
01:25:50;01:25:51;"Yo"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"So this is"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"One of the Gambinos, right?"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Giovanni Gambino"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"What a throwback"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Shout out to him"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"It's Gambino"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"You said Gambino, dog"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"His dad was John Gambino"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Shout out to him"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"Wow"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Gambino's"
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Where does he live?"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"Howard Beach?"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"He lives at Country Club over there by"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"South Jersey"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Across the bridge over there"
01:26:10;01:26:11;"He's still good"
01:26:11;01:26:12;"He doesn't really like going old school"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"He said, ""The world is dangerous today"
01:26:14;01:26:18;"But people living in New York neighborhoods with Sicilian connections should feel safe"""
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Yo, Max's girlfriend's mom used to say that"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"She was like 90 years old and wild racist"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"We make our friends and family unprotected from extremists and terrorists"
01:26:25;01:26:29;"Especially the brutal sociopathic organization that calls it Islamic State"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"This neighborhood was good, you know"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Back when it wasn't as brown"
01:26:33;01:26:36;"In lighter news"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"According to New York Post, page six"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"I get a lot of my gossip from"
01:26:41;01:26:45;"Carly Simon says that Sean Connery asked for a three-way with her sister"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"And they turned him down"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Sean Connery?"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Sean Connery, former James Bond"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Wait, when did this happen?"
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Like now or"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"When they were younger"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Either way, it's still kind of hot"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"But Carly Simon did it, right?"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Just not with her sister?"
01:26:57;01:27:00;"Didn't she still let Sean Connery smash?"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Sean Connery probably thought that song was about him"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Maybe"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Hey"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Maybe the sister did"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"I feel like this is kind of like a trend"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"I don't know if it's because maybe now"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Like gender politics changing"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"And more women feel comfortable speaking out"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"But you get a lot of these"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Like throwbacks from the 60s"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"Yeah"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"You know what it is?"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"It's like people write their memoirs"
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Right"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"And suddenly then all the kind of dirt comes up"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Things were wild back then"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"Yeah, it was crazy"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Things were wild back in the day"
01:27:26;01:27:27;"I feel like you could just say that as a blanket statement"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Like yo, if you were a dude in the 60s"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"You were out here wild"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"60s and 70s"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Doing wild stuff"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Babylon the Great"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Has fallen"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"I think that wraps up the news"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"I hope that was informative"
01:27:40;01:27:43;"What Lil Wayne song should we listen to?"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Mo Fire"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"No, let's listen to the one where"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Bobby Valentino pretends he's a siren"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"And we allowed him to do it"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Yo, shout out to this woman"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yo, who's on the party here?"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"Who?"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"She's called like Miss Officer"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Miss Police Lady"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Oh yeah, it's from the Carter III"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Yeah, that was lit"

01:28:32;01:28:35;"We can hear the angels calling us"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"We can see the sunrise before us"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"And when I'm in that thing"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"I make that body sign on me"

01:28:57;01:28:59;"And I stop by a later cop"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"She got me thinking I could date a cop"
01:29:02;01:29:05;"'Cause her uniform fits her so tight"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"She read me my rights"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"She put me in a call"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"She cut off all the lights"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"She said I had the right"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"To remain silent"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"Now I gotta holler"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Sounding like a siren"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"Talking 'bout"

01:29:29;01:29:30;"And all she want me to do is"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"The police"

01:32:46;01:32:48;"For Lil Wayne's song"
01:32:48;01:32:49;"Despot hates his song"
01:32:49;01:32:50;"I hate that song"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"I saw him play that song live at Bonnaroo"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"Oh, what?"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Yeah"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"I don't think Bonnaroo's the right place to see that song"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Well I did"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"And he brought this like"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"I guess probably stripper out"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"In like a cop outfit"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"And she, you know, she got the chair"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"And she sits in the chair and does a little dance"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"And he's rapping at her"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"And it was the corniest thing I've ever seen"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"I love how rappers, when they bring people out"
01:33:12;01:33:13;"It's just like there's no imagination"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"They never ask maybe a stage director"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"What vision do you see here?"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"They're like, no, get a woman"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"The song's about cops"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Pop a thong on her uniform and shake her cheeks"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"Go to Fredericks Island, get a cop uniform"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"And then when people ask, why did you have that woman?"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Why were you exploiting her?"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"He was like, no, it was a statement against police brutality"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"You can rock with that"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"You can"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"I was rocking with that"

01:34:44;01:34:47;"Yo, Adele is selling copies of her album like it's the bible"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"This is ridiculous"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"How does she know these numbers?"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"This is crazy"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"They gotta be selling this joint at the gas station or something"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Cause it's like, yo, you can really find this joint anywhere"
01:34:54;01:34:55;"Everyone has this"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Yo"

01:34:58;01:35:00;"She's right there next to Pentatonix"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"I think those kids in the subway, they're selling candy and Adele albums"
01:35:03;01:35:07;"I'm not selling this for my own money, I'm doing this to buy uniforms"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"Also, here's Adele's album, hello"
01:35:10;01:35:14;"I got peanut M&M's, I got Adele's album, I got Jolly Ranchers"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"All we got left is Adele's album"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"That's it"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"That's it, have a blast day"
01:35:18;01:35:23;"Supporting the basketball teams of America"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Here's Adele at number 5 with When We Were Young"
01:35:26;01:35:30;"I never heard this"
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Huh?"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"I just heard the one song"
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Yeah, wait, have you guys heard this one yet?"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Mac Wilds?"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"I haven't heard this"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"I'm probably gonna be hearing it forever"
01:35:37;01:35:44;"Everybody loves the things you do"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"From the way you talk"
01:35:47;01:35:51;"To the way you move"
01:35:52;01:35:57;"Everybody here is watching you"
01:35:57;01:36:01;"'Cause you feel like home"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"You're like a dream come true"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Yo, this is like the loneliest, loneliest b**** music, man"
01:36:07;01:36:13;"This is a whole thing of Edie's, Dolo tunes"
01:36:13;01:36:18;"'Cause I have a moment before I go"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"This is where I put ice cream on a chocolate chip cookie"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"I've been driving by myself all night long"
01:36:25;01:36:32;"Hoping you're someone I used to know"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"You look like a movie"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"You sound like a song"
01:36:38;01:36:42;"My God, this reminds me"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"Of when we were young"
01:36:45;01:36:49;"Let me photograph you in this light"
01:36:49;01:36:55;"In case it is the last time that we might be together"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"You guys get the idea"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"Yo, listen, somebody on Grey's Anatomy is either gonna smash or die to that"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"No, Grey's Anatomy can't afford that"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"I want to ruin a woman's life"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"Whoever ruined Adele's life on that level"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"She's making beautiful heartbreak music"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"None of my ex-girlfriends would ever make a song like that"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"What?"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"I feel like Happy Day, something really upbeat"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Yeah, 4-4 on the drums"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Cheerleader was what my ex wrote"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Shout out to Omi"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"That song's produced by Ariel Rekshad"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Co-producer of the Last Vampire Weekend album"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Shout out to him"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"Nobody couldn't possibly have a problem with"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"When We Were Young by Adele"
01:37:30;01:37:33;"Alec, you like it?"
01:37:33;01:37:36;"I mean, I don't care about it"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"You don't hate it or love it?"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"I'm not gonna tell you that I hate the song"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"I might, but I definitely don't like it"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"I don't care about it"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Nobody wants to hate on Adele"
01:37:46;01:37:49;"Nah, I don't hate on Adele"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"It's like bland, it's emotionless"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"It's emotional, but it's emotionless"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"She's going through something"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"That's funny, because what everybody says about Adele"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Is like she instantly makes you feel emotional"
01:37:58;01:38:01;"Maybe her first album, but I feel like she's melting it now"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"She's just like, ""Yo, how sad are you gonna be?"""
01:38:03;01:38:04;"You know what's crazy?"
01:38:04;01:38:07;"Come on, come out your house, the breakup's over"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"It's like 500 days of summer"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Eventually you gotta take your robe off"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"And stop going to the store"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"Listen, you got more than one pair of leggings, man"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"You know what I'm saying? I know you do"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"This artist is called Amy Vachelle"
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Vachelle, I don't know"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"That sounds like what my Italian neighbor used to call me"
01:38:21;01:38:22;"Taking points off"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"Hey, Vachelle, get out of here"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"What are you doing?"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Amy Brachelle"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"You smoking a papanha in my yard"
01:38:28;01:38:31;"And this is her performance of Blank Space by Taylor Swift"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"On The Voice"

01:39:46;01:39:50;"It really makes the original seem like a banger"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"Yeah, that's true"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Makes the original seem edgy"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"It does make the original seem edgy"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"I mean, look, well, first of all"
01:39:55;01:39:58;"The Voice is first and foremost about having a good voice"
01:39:58;01:40:01;"We can't frown on Amy, clearly you have a beautiful voice"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"You gotta buy a Starbucks gift card to that"
01:40:03;01:40:04;"Shout out to the glockenspiel in there, though"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"Ain't no glockenspiel in music nowadays"
01:40:07;01:40:08;"I wanna run in the studio when they were doing that"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"And just grab the glockenspiel"
01:40:09;01:40:12;"And just smash that shit on the ground, fam"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"It definitely does not hold a candle to the original"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"No, not at all"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"But you know, I don't wanna hate on an upcoming artist"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Yeah, nah, me neither"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"No, we're not hating on the artist"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"We're just hating on the song and the instruments"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"And the creation and the volume levels"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"And the modulation and everything"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"And the voice and the artist"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"The ukulele has gotta go, B"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"What was the last song you knew that had the ukulele and was a banger?"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"That big, that fat Hawaiian guy"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Yeah, but that was like someday over the rainbow"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Yeah, I'll tell you what the thing about the ukulele is"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Rest in peace to that big fat Hawaiian guy"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"The ukulele used to be like a weirdo instrument"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Either you were actually like a cool Hawaiian guy"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Or you were like a psycho"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"But then about ten years ago"
01:40:47;01:40:48;"A cool Hawaiian guy or a psycho"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"Or like a psycho white guy"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"But then about ten years ago"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"It became the kind of like you were saying"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"It was like the kind of the cutesy indie Target commercial sound"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"And then it just, I don't know"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"You lost all respect for it"
01:41:01;01:41:02;"You know what's crazy?"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"That shit at one point it was like"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Yo, you want a million views on YouTube?"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Yo, do this Migos song with a ukulele fam"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Pow, it's in a platinum"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"Holla at me"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Okay, you guys ready for number three?"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"Ready for number three"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"This is a young man out of Canada"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"A guy who really changed the face of music"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"You know who I'm talking about?"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"He had some rough times, but he's back"
01:41:19;01:41:20;"And he's huge again"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Show Claire"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Who do you know?"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"Cardinal Official"
01:41:24;01:41:25;"Cardinal Official?"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"It's Not Snow"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Oh man, I don't even want to hear it now"
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Justin Bieber"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"The Biebs"
01:41:31;01:41:47;"Justin Bieber tried to fight me once"
01:41:47;01:41:48;"He tried to fight you?"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"At Coachella"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Yo, that's a dumb"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Yo, I gotta"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"Listen, you guys aren't recording this"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Didn't I tell this story before?"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Not on the, not on Time Crisis"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Yeah, okay"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Yeah, tell the story"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"F*** the song"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"Everyone in the studio is staring right at this spot right now"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"So what happened?"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"I didn't do anything"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"I actually didn't do"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Alright, so I was at Coachella"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"I guess this is maybe two Coachellas ago"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"He was, cause Justin Bieber was there"
01:42:13;01:42:14;"Cause he did like"
01:42:14;01:42:15;"He jumped up with Chance the Rapper"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"They had a song together"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"And he jumped up with that"
01:42:17;01:42:21;"And I was hanging out with Wicky from the rap group Rat King"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"Cause they had played at like 12pm"
01:42:23;01:42:26;"Which is, you know, an unfortunate Coachella slot"
01:42:26;01:42:30;"Me and Wicky are sitting by the trailers drinking"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"And I look down on the floor"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"Like right next to me"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"And this girl's laying on the floor"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"And I was like, oh"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"That girl who's laying on the floor right there"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Is a good looking girl"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"And whatever, I keep drinking"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"And I look again"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"And I was like, oh that's Selena Gomez"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"She was just lying on the floor?"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"Laying on the floor"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"Like, you know, sunglasses on, whatever"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Just relaxing"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Yeah, she wasn't dead"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Oh, I thought she was like passed out"
01:42:54;01:42:57;"That changes the story"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"Nah, she was just chilling"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"And then, you know, Wicky was like, word, that's her"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"And he looked"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Yeah, and she hears what we're saying"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"She's right there next to us"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"So she was like, can I have some of that tequila"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"So he was like, yeah, yeah"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Come in the trailer"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"We're drinking, you know, in there and shit"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"And whenever we talk a little"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Come out the trailer"
01:43:16;01:43:19;"And there's Justin Bieber looking like, you know"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"He was obviously looking for her"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"And it's just like, oh"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Coming out of the trailer with two dudes, okay"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"And Bieber's fed up, damn"
01:43:27;01:43:28;"He picked her up"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"Like, immediately"
01:43:29;01:43:32;"Picks her up, wraps her legs around him"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"And walks away with her"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"And we were just like, oh, alright"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"I mean, he looked like he was mad"
01:43:37;01:43:39;"So what do you mean he picks her up like"
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Like she just"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Just like, you know, hey, here I am"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Hey baby"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"I'm taking this, you know"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"I'm out"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"And he walked away"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"But then he like deposits her"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Not very far from where we were"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"And comes back and does the thing where, you know"
01:43:52;01:43:55;"He puts his face like as close as he can to, you know"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"My face and Rookie's face"
01:43:57;01:44:00;"Like, yeah, you know, like do something type thing"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"But there's like four giant security guards"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And I'm kind of like, you know"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"That at least deserves like a mush"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Like I should have at least just been like"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Yeah, alright man"
01:44:09;01:44:12;"But if I did that, I would have gotten pummeled"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"By these like seven foot tall"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"So nothing happened, but"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"So Justin Bieber didn't actually say anything to you?"
01:44:17;01:44:20;"Nah, just the grill, the very close ice grill"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"You kind of got to give Justin Bieber props for that"
01:44:22;01:44:23;"That's mad weird, man"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"I mean, the fact that he would actually just stare you in the face"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Is surprising"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"But that was him flexing"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"That was him being like, you're not gonna do s***"
01:44:30;01:44:33;"Like, oh yeah, you want to try to take my girl in a trailer"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"You piece of garbage"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Did his big homies high five him as he walked away?"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"Nah, they were just watching"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"Because he probably does that all the time"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Like he's allowed to play out"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"Whoever he wants to play out, cause you know"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Wow"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"It's literally like being a prince"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"It's like in medieval times"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Being a prince and like walking through the village"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"And you have your knights and everything"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Exactly"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"You do what you want"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"I'm taking your radishes"
01:44:53;01:44:58;"Strike them down with all your might"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"On that note, let's get into the number two song"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Guess what? It's by Justin Bieber"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"Oh man"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Here's a song called Sorry"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"This one's going out to Despacito"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Oh my God"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Ooh, ooh"
01:45:10;01:45:15;"Ooh, ooh"
01:45:15;01:45:20;"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty"
01:45:20;01:45:25;"You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies"
01:45:25;01:45:30;"I hope I don't run out of time cause I want call a referee"
01:45:30;01:45:34;"Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness"
01:45:35;01:45:39;"I know you know that I make those mistakes maybe once or twice"
01:45:39;01:45:44;"But by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times"
01:45:44;01:45:49;"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem all myself tonight"
01:45:49;01:45:53;"Cause I just need one more shot at second chances"
01:45:53;01:45:58;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
01:45:58;01:46:03;"Cause I'm missing more than just your body"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Oh, is it too late now?"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Yes"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Uh, Desus I got a question for you"
01:46:09;01:46:11;"You're a man of Jamaican heritage"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"That's right, what's going on, what's going on"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"How do you feel about Justin Bieber becoming the new king of dancehall?"
01:46:16;01:46:19;"I love it, he's picking up where Sean Paul left off"
01:46:19;01:46:20;"You know that song Red Red Wine?"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Yeah, yeah"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"Classic song"
01:46:22;01:46:23;"My father loved that song"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"My father would play that song all the time"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"Every barbecue"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"No, every, anytime he'd come home from work"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"It's just be like, Red Red Wine"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Which, the UB40 version or the old one?"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"The UB40 version"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"And then, cause we didn't have cable"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"When he found out it was white people singing it"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Cause you know there's some white people in UB40"
01:46:39;01:46:42;"So he saw the video, I think he saw it on MTV or something"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"He was like, his mind was blown for like two weeks"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"Yo, you know what's crazy?"
01:46:45;01:46:49;"I think, I'm pretty sure UB40 are the best selling reggae artists of all time"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Yes, yes, I saw something like that"
01:46:50;01:46:51;"Bigger than Bob Marley"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Bigger than Bob Marley?"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Yes"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"What?"
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Yo, UB40 got hits"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Straight out of Birmingham, UK"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"That's a little low key trivia"
01:46:58;01:47:01;"Who's doing numbers like that? Bigger than Bob Marley?"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Yo, we out here"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"What did Drake say?"
01:47:03;01:47:07;"Drake said, on the road I do One Direction numbers"
01:47:07;01:47:10;"He was like, on the road I do UB40 numbers"
01:47:10;01:47:13;"All his fans would be like, what's that?"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Is that the abortion pill?"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"Oh, s***"
01:47:15;01:47:18;"You guys ready for number one song?"
01:47:18;01:47:22;"This is really, there's only three artists in the top five this week"
01:47:22;01:47:25;"Justin Bieber, Amy Vaccaro"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"And again, at Sitting Pretty at number one"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"French Montana"
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Adele"
01:47:30;01:47:44;"I'm just wondering"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Damn, babe"
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Don't be sad now"
01:47:46;01:47:47;"F***"
01:47:47;01:47:53;"To go over everything"
01:47:53;01:47:56;"They say that time's supposed to heal ya"
01:47:56;01:48:00;"But I ain't done much healing"
01:48:00;01:48:05;"Hello, can you hear me?"
01:48:05;01:48:11;"I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be"
01:48:11;01:48:17;"When we were younger and free"
01:48:17;01:48:23;"I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet"
01:48:23;01:48:36;"There's such a difference between us and a million miles"
01:48:36;01:48:42;"Hello from the other side"
01:48:42;01:48:46;"I must have called a thousand times"
01:48:46;01:48:49;"I have a real problem, I keep singing"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"It's crazy, I don't know how this got stuck in my head"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"But I keep singing this song as like a Nickelback or Metallica song"
01:48:54;01:48:57;"And then I can't stop singing, because it really sounds like one"
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Can we do it?"
01:48:58;01:49:02;"Hello from the other side"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Like once you do that once"
01:49:04;01:49:08;"Hello from the other side"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"There is something kind of like metal about this song"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"It's a little dark"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Let's go to the studio right now and do the original"
01:49:14;01:49:19;"It's really like a thin line between kind of like sad pop music and like metal"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Yeah"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Yeah, 'cause like Guns N' Roses is like the middle ground"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"There's nothing more metal than love"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"That's right"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Wow, that's deep"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"That's deep, right?"
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Someone's gonna say that and then put like a Marilyn Monroe picture on it"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"I know, it's gonna be all over Tumblr"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"This is white people kissing in the rain music"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"This is a genre of music"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"It's called white people kissing in the rain music"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"I feel like Adele does appeal to everybody"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"I think it's 'cause she's British"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"That's probably it, yeah"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Like if she was American"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"They probably wouldn't bang on her like that"
01:49:42;01:49:43;"I don't know"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"'Cause you know, to people in the hood, British people are like aliens"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"It's like they're not even like people"
01:49:47;01:49:48;"They're like butlers"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"It's just like, ""Yo, do you hear that accent?"""
01:49:49;01:49:53;"So when she does an interview, it's like, ""Oh, wow, oh, she's from England, she's proper, she's British"""
01:49:53;01:49:55;"We feel like they're better than us"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"'Cause you know, we still have that whole, they used to like own the United States thing"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"They're the big brother"
01:49:59;01:50:00;"So you hear it, and you're like, ""Yeah"""
01:50:00;01:50:04;"They made me talk like this in high school, man, for my literature class"
01:50:04;01:50:07;"You know what I'm saying? I'm not with all this mate"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"But then in the UK, Adele's a little bit like a working class hero"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Yeah?"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"'Cause like, she's from like North London"
01:50:12;01:50:15;"Like her, you know how British people, you have family in the UK"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"So you know how British people are obsessed with accents"
01:50:17;01:50:18;"Yes"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"In a way that in, like whatever, we might like joke about different York accents"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"But in like, it's literally like 10 billion accents"
01:50:23;01:50:27;"And you can tell where somebody's from, like how much money, like their dad's telling you"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"Oh yeah, like right off"
01:50:28;01:50:33;"So there's a thing when Adele, like when she was first on like one of the big late night talk shows"
01:50:33;01:50:38;"And she was talking, like the guy made a joke like, ""I had no idea you were so common"""
01:50:38;01:50:41;"You know the same way like Amy Winehouse is like working class"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"But like America, we can't like tell the difference"
01:50:43;01:50:44;"Right"
01:50:44;01:50:47;"I have a theory about Adele, I don't think she would be as poppin' if she was like a size 4"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"If she was skinny?"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"That's true"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:50:50;01:50:53;"I think the big girls vibe were like, ""Yo, she's one of us"""
01:50:53;01:50:55;"If she's not threatening to skinnier girls?"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"Yeah"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"Okay guys, that was the top 5"
01:50:57;01:50:58;"Top 5"
01:50:58;01:51:02;"We had 2 Adele songs, 2 Bieber songs, 1 Amy Vachelle song"
01:51:02;01:51:03;"What's your pick, Mero?"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Oh man, the Bieber joint"
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Sorry, the dance off?"
01:51:06;01:51:09;"Yeah, cause first of all, first and foremost, cause he apologized to Desmond, I respect that"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"I respect that move"
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Wait, what, he apologized?"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"The beat was knockin'"
01:51:13;01:51:14;"He apologized?"
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Well, in the song, sorry"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"Oh, okay, I was like, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"""
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Desus, your pick?"
01:51:18;01:51:21;"I gotta go with the Ukele girl"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"Oh, I respect that, I respect that"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"I respect that"
01:51:24;01:51:25;"Desbot"
01:51:25;01:51:29;"Could you find forgiveness in your heart to choose a Justin Bieber song?"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Yeah, I'm going with ""Sorry"""
01:51:31;01:51:32;"I appreciate him"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"That's the bigger man, that's the bigger man right there"
01:51:34;01:51:38;"Well, you know, he stepped up to the plate, he apologized in front of the whole world"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"In front of everybody"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Over a dancehall beat"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"Yeah"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"International, world culture"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"He knew what kind of beat I wanted him to apologize over"
01:51:44;01:51:45;"That's right"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"He's like, ""I remember what you used to listen to in a dollar van, my G, I got you"""
01:51:48;01:51:49;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"That's a classic Jamaican apology"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"You gotta get on a remix"
01:51:52;01:51:53;"Yeah, I'm down"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"If Bieber, if you're listening"
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Reach out, Biebs"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Yo, make it happen"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"We could really bury the hatchet on the remix"
01:51:58;01:51:59;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:51:59;01:52:00;"Yo, Bieber, hit me with your new number"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"What I have for you doesn't work anymore"
01:52:02;01:52:06;"So, I'm calling you like Adele, man"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Like, hello?"
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Yo, listen, please take off"
01:52:08;01:52:09;"What should we listen to?"
01:52:09;01:52:10;"I've never actually listened to it"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Is the Rick Ross/Adele remix good?"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I haven't heard it"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"You know what?"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"It's a typical Rick Ross thing"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"Where clearly somebody was like, ""Yo, Rick Ross, you're gonna remix this song?"""
01:52:18;01:52:22;"And Rick Ross is like, ""I'm not listening to the song, I'm just gonna rap about whatever"""
01:52:22;01:52:23;"So Adele's rapping about love"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"And then Rick Ross comes talking about Coke and Maybach"
01:52:25;01:52:26;"Coke rocks"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"Yeah"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"Coke rocks"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Alright, we gotta listen to it"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"This is the Rick Ross remix of ""Adele, Hello"""
01:52:31;01:52:36;"Renzel, a.k.a. Ricky Rubin"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"I miss you kissing my lips, consoling my confidence"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"Apologies from the heart is something that's heaven sent"
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Scars for the flesh, war wounds for the soul"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"Success is another test and we wanted the highest score"
01:52:48;01:52:51;"Mother did her job, fundamental love"
01:52:51;01:52:54;"But it never was enough, was I born to be a thug?"
01:52:54;01:52:58;"Tears fall all the way to the south of France"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"The poverty line hang lower than my pants"
01:53:01;01:53:04;"Invited to the Grammys but I feel so out of place"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"After we washed plates, they was always out of state"
01:53:07;01:53:10;"That is a sin, I will build to win"
01:53:10;01:53:13;"Came to take the title, rosé waving in the stands"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"Academics was a myth, I can always pleat the fifth"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"I'll give it to you live, Beethoven on the fifth"
01:53:19;01:53:22;"Your favorite films tank, Titanic sank"
01:53:22;01:53:25;"Aroma of the dank as I'm breezing through the bank"
01:53:25;01:53:29;"Lock it open, forbidden is from the poorest to the richest"
01:53:29;01:53:32;"From the poorest to the richest"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"Ricky Ross"
01:53:37;01:53:41;"Ricky Ross with his remix of Videl's smash single ""Hello"""
01:53:41;01:53:44;"And that's about it for Time Crisis 11 Thanksgiving Edition"
01:53:44;01:53:48;"Very blessed to have Jesus and Meryl back in the studio"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"We are the ones that is blessed my son"
01:53:50;01:53:51;"Thanks for allowing us back in here"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"Back in New York I feel like Patrick Ewan"
01:53:53;01:53:54;"Shout out Makonnen"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Shout out Alabaster Ewan"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"Lamar Down out there, Portingus"
01:53:58;01:53:59;"Shout out to Portingus"
01:53:59;01:54:00;"We bang with you my guy"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"I know you've seen us on the Snapchat bullying you and shit on the draft day"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"But that's not really how we feel my guy"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"We're saying sorry like Justin Bieber"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"That's right"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Big things popping for Portingus"
01:54:08;01:54:09;"We should get him on the show sometime"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Definitely"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"He said it today, his favorite artist is Future"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"He likes to listen to Future before NickGames"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Well Despot and I made an appearance in a Future video"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"I saw that"
01:54:18;01:54:19;"Supposedly"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"I saw, you know what, I was just like yo"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"I was looking through it, I was like"
01:54:22;01:54:23;"I was like let me see this video"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"I was like is that Ezra?"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"That's right"
