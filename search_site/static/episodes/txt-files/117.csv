00:00;00:12;"Time Crisis in a time of crisis and the crisis still has time to crisis."
00:12;00:19;"This week we get deep with Nathan, the man behind the Stakem's Twitter account."
00:19;00:27;"We also check in with Brian Jones, the Vampire Weekend guitarist. All this plus"
00:27;00:34;"the Bellamy Brothers."
01:19;01:26;"Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake? The usual. Same old, same old. Living my"
01:26;01:30;"quarantine life. When people ask me how I'm doing I always say business as usual"
01:30;01:35;"but I guess I would say that no matter what. I like to say same old, same old"
01:35;01:39;"business as usual. I find that sometimes people say how you doing and say not bad"
01:39;01:46;"and 1 in 20 people will be like taking it back. I think like 19 out of 20 people"
01:46;01:51;"be like good to hear and other people be like not bad. That doesn't sound great."
01:51;01:57;"I'm pretty into just saying pretty solid as a response. How you doing? Pretty solid."
01:57;02:06;"That's very Jake. Just solid. But pretty solid. Solid as a rock when you're really"
02:06;02:10;"feeling like you got your s*** together. How are you guys opening emails these days?"
02:10;02:16;"Are you saying like you're doing well in these strange and uncertain times? You know there's always a variation of that."
02:16;02:20;"I was gonna say that was very unusual and Seinfeld just jumping right in but I was"
02:20;02:24;"about to say I heard before the show that Seinfeld was pretty fired up today."
02:24;02:30;"Oh I'm charged up you guys. I love this. Well okay Seinfeld before we get to your"
02:30;02:34;"fascinating question about opening emails, why are you so fired up man?"
02:34;02:38;"I'm just stoked to see you guys that's all it is. I've caffeinated, I had a good meal"
02:38;02:42;"and I'm just energized and just ready for an intense new time crisis. That's"
02:42;02:47;"all it is. Well I guess a lot of times back in the old world when we'd record TC"
02:47;02:52;"sometimes you'd be rolling after a full day of work. That's correct. Some people"
02:52;02:56;"probably think that you're just some you know watch Seinfeld all night sleep all"
02:56;03:02;"day kind of weirdo who lives in like some replica Seinfeld apartment. Okay hang on."
03:02;03:05;"No no I'm just saying I'm saying that's what the haters would say."
03:05;03:09;"But you're a very hard-working guy as long as I've known you you've always had"
03:09;03:15;"an intense job. Seinfeld is your passion but you know you're out there providing."
03:15;03:19;"It's exhausting. Well thank you yeah. I don't know if people realize that you're"
03:19;03:24;"a hustler. All day. What do you drink in there? Are you drinking coffee right now?"
03:24;03:29;"Coffee or wine? This is Coca-Cola. That's like out of a wine glass. No this is a"
03:29;03:33;"normal glass. I think that's a stemless wine glass. Wait wait hold up the glass."
03:33;03:38;"That's a stemless wine glass. Yep confirmed. You know I've never considered"
03:38;03:42;"I've been using these glasses for years and I've never considered them as such."
03:42;03:48;"So hold on. Jake do you want to describe it to the listeners? It's a bulbous glass."
03:48;03:53;"Right because it's kind of rounder at the bottom. It's got a pear-shaped"
03:53;03:57;"bottom. If like the sides were totally straight you'd be like that's for water"
03:57;04:03;"or yeah yeah exactly. Hard alcohol. And so he's drinking soda out of a wine glass"
04:03;04:06;"and you know what respect. I don't know if I really agree with this"
04:06;04:10;"characterization of the glass that I'm using. I think that the angle might be a little off."
04:10;04:15;"Maybe the roles are reversed today. You came in here fired up. I might have to"
04:15;04:22;"crunch some numbers. I'm on Google right now. This is Freaky Friday."
04:22;04:27;"Alright I just crunched the numbers and I just want to let you in on some of my"
04:27;04:32;"methods. I googled stemless wine glasses but then I clicked over to images. Look"
04:32;04:37;"obviously we do radio here so I don't actually buy the myth that a picture is"
04:37;04:41;"worth a thousand words because I think we do quite a bit with words. Sometimes"
04:41;04:45;"more than a picture but for me sometimes when I'm researching I find that if I go"
04:45;04:50;"to images first it can sometimes save me a few clicks. Especially if what I'm"
04:50;04:54;"looking up has to do with what something looks like. You know I might not need the"
04:54;04:58;"whole history. I might not need the whole Wikipedia page. So that's just one of my"
04:58;05:02;"number crunching tricks. I guess you call it like that. That makes a lot of sense Ezra. That makes a lot of sense."
05:02;05:07;"Thank You Jake. So anyway I type in stemless wine glasses. I immediately"
05:07;05:11;"click over to images. I don't have time for all that. I don't care about"
05:11;05:15;"shopping or news. So I go right to images and based on the pictures that I'm"
05:15;05:21;"seeing. Seinfeld you got yourself a stemless wine glass right there."
05:21;05:25;"And you know what I have done the exact same Google image search that you have"
05:25;05:29;"and I have to say you're absolutely right. But I also feel like we've gotten"
05:29;05:34;"derailed. So you admit it. Okay hold on. So you admit it. You're drinking out of a"
05:34;05:38;"stemless wine glass. Hold on. I just want to do that. Remember that meme from a few years ago."
05:38;05:42;"Ladies and gentlemen we got them."
05:42;05:52;"So you just have cans of coke in the fridge? Not all the time. Sometimes I'll"
05:52;05:56;"have like a Mexican coke. It comes and goes. Sometimes I'll be like I'm drinking"
05:56;06:00;"too much coke and I'll stop for a few weeks. Sometimes I'm stocked up. It sounds"
06:00;06:04;"like that's a regular grocery item in your household. I'd say not every time."
06:04;06:08;"But you know I don't know how interesting this is guys. I was just"
06:08;06:13;"trying to start off with a very relatable like how are you opening emails these days."
06:13;06:17;"Because I feel like there's a tendency to say I hope you're doing well."
06:17;06:21;"Well okay well hold on. My first question to you was why are you so fired up? And I"
06:21;06:25;"think one answer we got is that you're just guzzling coke from a stemless"
06:25;06:30;"wine glass. So that's definitely part of it. Okay so your question for us was how"
06:30;06:35;"are we opening email these days? Like are we using Outlook? Which device?"
06:35;06:39;"No I mean how are you beginning the emails that you compose when you"
06:39;06:44;"communicate with your your friends and associates? Oh well like I said you're a"
06:44;06:48;"hard-working person with a real job so you're probably busting out way more"
06:48;06:54;"dear sir or madams to whom it may concern. It hasn't crossed my mind. I"
06:54;06:59;"don't really have to send a lot of emails. I guess I've had other forms of"
06:59;07:03;"communication like if I'm texting with somebody we haven't talked in a while."
07:03;07:07;"For me it's less in the beginning it's more at the end where it's just like you"
07:07;07:11;"know by the way I hope you're doing good with all this crazy stuff going on. Just"
07:11;07:16;"to not let a whole communication pass without some reference to the pandemic"
07:16;07:21;"which I'm sure is what everybody wants. Jake you send a lot of emails? I don't"
07:21;07:25;"initiate a lot of emails. I respond to emails and most of the emails I've been"
07:25;07:29;"getting recently do usually open or close with a reference to the"
07:29;07:35;"coronavirus and I when I respond I make no reference to the virus at all. Yeah"
07:35;07:39;"you see I did this the other day where I decided to forego the strange and"
07:39;07:45;"uncertain times opening and/or closer and the person who replied to me a little"
07:45;07:49;"bit passive-aggressively really leaned in hard on the I hope you're doing well"
07:49;07:53;"in these strange and uncertain times and then I felt bad I thought oh I thought it"
07:53;07:57;"was implied at this point several weeks in that I hope they were doing well in"
07:57;08:00;"these strange and uncertain times but I don't know maybe I'm just being a little"
08:00;08:04;"oversensitive because the times are strange and uncertain. You know people"
08:04;08:11;"sometimes have the email signature like sent from my iPhone or you know with"
08:11;08:15;"your bit and some details about your job and stuff you could put one end to saying"
08:15;08:20;"like the above was written in the context of the strange and uncertain"
08:20;08:26;"times we're living in please don't mistake any lack of reference for a"
08:26;08:32;"callousness or aloofness on my part I'm very aware of it that way you don't have"
08:32;08:37;"to reference it. I saw I was thinking of time crisis because and some of what"
08:37;08:40;"we're gonna get into today we got the Stakehams guy coming which is a major"
08:40;08:45;"get. Huge. We're kind of on fire with the guests lately I gotta say but I saw this"
08:45;08:50;"on Instagram I think it was a tweet from Internet Hippo I could open my camera"
08:50;08:53;"roll and look at it but I think it's a more interesting for the listeners if I"
08:53;08:57;"just kind of paraphrase it it was basically somebody saying normal times"
08:57;09:03;"Toyota ad buy a Toyota and then like COVID times and it said like in these"
09:03;09:11;"strange and uncertain times dot dot dot buy a Toyota. I was like yeah that kind of sums it up."
09:15;09:28;"I travel on their way from here Calming the restless mind"
09:28;09:48;"Easing all of their fear Strange times are here"
09:48;09:53;"I think it's worth just reflecting on last week's episode for a second because we had"
09:53;09:56;"the great Jerry Saltz on Art Critic for New York Magazine."
09:56;10:02;"We mostly talked about his love of gas station coffee and art criticism, but at the end we"
10:02;10:05;"got into a little bit of Grateful Dead."
10:05;10:10;"And I just thought it was interesting, somebody added me on his Instagram where he responded"
10:10;10:16;"to a question of like, ""What's like the most epic s*** you've ever seen in a concert?"""
10:16;10:19;"And it was kind of interesting because on our show he was going on about like, ""Forget"
10:19;10:22;"about the 60s, enough with the 60s worship."""
10:22;10:28;"And when they asked him what his favorite, the most epic things he'd ever witnessed in"
10:28;10:34;"concert, this is what the Grateful Dead hating, ""Forget about the 60s,"" Jerry Saltz had to"
10:34;10:35;"say."
10:35;10:38;"These are the three most epic things he's ever seen at a concert."
10:38;10:42;"Number one, Jimi Hendrix light his guitar on fire, place it on the ground, face it on"
10:42;10:44;"his knees and worship it."
10:44;10:49;"Number two, Jim Morrison created a giant riot in Chicago threatening to pull it out."
10:49;10:53;"Number three, Led Zeppelin as third backup band play entire first album to a room of"
10:53;10:55;"60 in Chicago."
10:55;10:57;"All three of those examples are in the 60s, man."
10:57;10:59;"You're living in the past, Jerry."
10:59;11:01;"Well, look, I don't want to call him an enemy of the show."
11:01;11:02;"I want him to be a friend of the show."
11:02;11:03;"And you know what?"
11:03;11:07;"You don't have to like the Grateful Dead to be a friend of the show, but he backtracked"
11:07;11:09;"a little bit and it helps."
11:09;11:12;"And in fact, people probably think we talk about the Grateful Dead a little bit too much"
11:12;11:13;"on the show."
11:13;11:14;"And you know what?"
11:14;11:18;"They might be partially right, but I was thinking, because I was reflecting on the fact that we"
11:18;11:22;"did these two different interviews on the last episode and in both of them, the subject"
11:22;11:24;"was asked if they liked the Grateful Dead."
11:24;11:29;"To be fair, one guy's name was Jerry and one guy's a famous musician, Ed O'Brien from Radiohead."
11:29;11:35;"So you know, it's not like super random, but I think little by little, we'll kind of develop"
11:35;11:38;"the time crisis version of the Proust questionnaire."
11:38;11:42;"The writer Marcel Proust had this questionnaire that people would fill out and everybody answers"
11:42;11:43;"the same question."
11:43;11:45;"So it's kind of interesting to see what people say."
11:45;11:51;"Over the years, Vanity Fair has used it as a way to interview people."
11:51;11:56;"You have variations on it from the TV show Inside the Actor's Studio, rest in peace,"
11:56;11:57;"James Lipton."
11:57;11:58;"Right."
11:58;12:01;"I think it is important to limit the amount of Grateful Dead talk."
12:01;12:03;"Let it happen organically."
12:03;12:04;"It does."
12:04;12:06;"It does."
12:06;12:08;"It comes up organically pretty often."
12:08;12:12;"But I think when interviewing people, it got me thinking about like, little by little,"
12:12;12:16;"we got to create kind of like a TC Proust questionnaire."
12:16;12:20;"Because you know, you ask people questions that are tailored to them and you know, to"
12:20;12:22;"find out who they are and what they do."
12:22;12:26;"But at some point, you got to ask everybody the same question, because that's actually"
12:26;12:28;"lets you know more."
12:28;12:33;"So I think one of the TC Proust questionnaire questions is, what do you think of the Grateful"
12:33;12:34;"Dead?"
12:34;12:36;"And you know, it's cool when people don't like the dead."
12:36;12:38;"That actually, you know, says a lot about."
12:38;12:44;"I think in every case, we've asked somebody that it opens up an interesting conversation."
12:44;12:45;"I was thinking about some other one."
12:45;12:49;"I mean, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, maybe I said O'Brien that I don't know, maybe that's a"
12:49;12:50;"little gimmicky."
12:50;12:53;"Maybe we can refine that like a food question."
12:53;12:54;"A snack food question in general."
12:54;12:57;"Yeah, maybe some kind of snack food question."
12:57;13:01;"Another one I thought of, which we haven't asked people very often is, did you vote for"
13:01;13:02;"Bernie?"
13:02;13:04;"Which, you know, people might find contentious."
13:04;13:05;"Personal."
13:05;13:07;"It's personal, but I would just like want to know, you know what I mean?"
13:07;13:09;"It's like if you talk to somebody, whatever the answers are, you're like, do you like"
13:09;13:10;"the dead?"
13:10;13:11;"No."
13:11;13:12;"Did you vote for Bernie?"
13:12;13:13;"No."
13:13;13:14;"Never?"
13:14;13:15;"Nope."
13:15;13:17;"Not in the primary in 2016, not in 2020."
13:17;13:20;"But anyway, little by little, I want to develop this questionnaire."
13:20;13:21;"I think I like this idea."
13:21;13:22;"Back to Jerry."
13:22;13:25;"Clearly, the 60s made a big impact on him."
13:25;13:29;"And one thing I was thinking about afterwards is just like, again, not to beat a dead horse,"
13:29;13:33;"but when he was going on about the 60s, I was like, I don't know what you're talking"
13:33;13:34;"about, man."
13:34;13:37;"Like 60s dead is such like a tiny part of like the whole story."
13:37;13:38;"Sure."
13:38;13:41;"I'll throw it on from time to time, like Alive Dead, the record."
13:41;13:46;"But like, I'm just kind of like, man, they really hit their stride in the 70s and like"
13:46;13:49;"the 80s produced a lot of beloved songs too."
13:49;13:51;"Then you got spring 90 in the final years."
13:51;13:56;"Like you're the one stuck in the 60s because you associate the dead so much with the 60s."
13:56;13:57;"We'll have him back on."
13:57;13:58;"We'll hash it out."
13:58;13:59;"But you know what I mean?"
13:59;14:02;"But they're like, they're known as like a really psychedelic band that came out of San"
14:02;14:03;"Francisco."
14:03;14:07;"So it's not that much of a stretch to associate them with the 60s."
14:07;14:11;"I mean, if you're a true head, you know, like the bulk of their great stuff that happened"
14:11;14:17;"in the 70s, but like just like a cursory glance at their sort of cultural imprint, you think"
14:17;14:24;"60s, like if there's like a time, life montage of the 60s, you're going to get like Kate"
14:24;14:29;"Ashbery and San Francisco and maybe like a shot of the dead, like Golden Gate Park."
14:29;14:30;"They were there."
14:30;14:31;"Yeah, absolutely."
14:31;14:35;"And that's the culture that they came out of, but they really hit their stride in the"
14:35;14:36;"70s."
14:36;14:39;"Their most beloved studio albums, their best touring years."
14:39;14:43;"I would actually say, and again, I just dug myself a grave because you know, some people"
14:43;14:46;"are going to be like, these guys can't stop beating a dead horse."
14:46;14:49;"But when I see a connection, I got to go for it."
14:49;14:54;"I think it's a little bit like Seinfeld, the show, but Seinfeld, back me up on this."
14:54;14:59;"Grateful Dead, their early work came out in the late 60s, but then they, their first truly"
14:59;15:02;"beloved studio album came out in 1970."
15:02;15:06;"And then they were off to the races, bringing all sorts of new influences and changing culture"
15:06;15:11;"through the 70s and arguably becoming the dead that took over the world."
15:11;15:14;"What decade did Seinfeld debut in?"
15:14;15:18;"Seinfeld debuted in the 80s, but didn't really pop off until the 90s."
15:18;15:22;"Took about three, four seasons for it to really find its voice and its audience."
15:22;15:25;"It is considered kind of like such a 90s show."
15:25;15:32;"Well, really you're like Jerry's style, his hair, the show started in the late 80s."
15:32;15:38;"It kind of came out of Jerry's and Larry's life experience of being like comedians in"
15:38;15:40;"1980s New York."
15:40;15:43;"And I just think there's some resonance there."
15:43;15:46;"And I think it's always like funny when you get like the tail end."
15:46;15:50;"Somehow this relates to the concept of the tight eight, where it's like you start your"
15:50;15:55;"career at the tail end of a decade and you're a little bit, you're right on the cusp of"
15:55;15:58;"like, are you going to be associated with that one or the one to come?"
15:58;16:02;"And in the Grateful Dead case, they started in the late 60s."
16:02;16:07;"So it's like Nirvana put out their first record in 89, same year as Seinfeld."
16:07;16:08;"Yeah, right."
16:08;16:09;"So two quintessential 90s things."
16:09;16:10;"Yeah."
16:11;16:14;"But what's the, what's the mean, like what's the average of Grateful Dead?"
16:14;16:18;"Like if you took the year they started and the year they ended, where does that meet"
16:18;16:19;"in the middle?"
16:19;16:20;"Maybe that's a better determination."
16:20;16:23;"That's a great call Seinfeld."
16:23;16:26;"So roughly the 67 and 95, right?"
16:26;16:27;"Yeah."
16:27;16:31;"I mean, I think technically the Warlock started like 65 or something, but yeah, let's say"
16:31;16:37;"the Grateful Dead releasing records from 67 on Jerry dies in 95."
16:37;16:40;"So that's 80, 28 years."
16:40;16:42;"So 81 would be the halfway."
16:42;16:43;"Yeah."
16:43;16:44;"So kind of like that."
16:44;16:45;"So the Dead peaked in 81."
16:45;16:47;"Althea, they're an 80s band."
16:47;16:52;"Well in some ways, I mean, Althea, I think that debuted live in 79, but you know, that"
16:52;16:56;"song came out in the eighties, certainly a beloved song."
16:56;16:59;"And then, you know, they had their touch of gray Renaissance."
16:59;17:01;"So anyway, this is us talking less about the Grateful Dead."
17:01;17:13;"I told Althea I was feeling lost, lacking in some direction."
17:13;17:25;"Althea told me about scrutiny, her mind, back, mind, need protection."
17:25;17:37;"I told Althea that treachery was tearing me limb from limb."
17:37;17:46;"Althea told me how to cool down the boy, settle back, please, in case."
17:46;17:50;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
17:50;17:55;"I gotta say, the response to the Jerry Salts interview was huge."
17:55;18:01;"I got a lot of personal texts and DMs from people and people seemed very moved by that"
18:01;18:02;"interview, which is great."
18:02;18:04;"Yeah, it really did get like a big response."
18:04;18:10;"And I mean, between that and Ed from Radiohead, it was like a very stacked episode, but Jerry"
18:10;18:12;"Salts is an icon and I did enjoy his book."
18:12;18:16;"I finished it since the last time we talked and I think it's something I'll continue to"
18:16;18:17;"go back to."
18:17;18:20;"It's just kind of like good, simple advice for artists."
18:20;18:23;"But I didn't know that it would strike a chord with so many people."
18:23;18:27;"Well, Seinfeld, you were manning the Twitter, so you were seeing this unfold in real time."
18:27;18:32;"I was seeing it in real time and I think people didn't see it coming, the profundity of it."
18:32;18:37;"And I think it was a rare example of some old wisdom that frankly, we don't really have"
18:37;18:38;"that often on the show."
18:38;18:42;"I mean, in front of the show, Larry David, but he was kind of taking a more comedic bent."
18:42;18:48;"This was like some real grown man talk that I think we don't often get."
18:48;18:49;"That's a great point."
18:49;18:54;"At the beginning of Time of Crisis, Time Crisis, we were talking about old wisdom."
18:54;18:58;"Jake made the great old wisdom playlist, but we haven't made much of an effort outside"
18:58;19:01;"of Jerry Salts to get more people 60 plus."
19:01;19:04;"Maybe we need some 70 plus, some 80 plus."
19:04;19:08;"I think we should get more old wisdom for everybody sitting at home because I think"
19:08;19:10;"there's probably a lot of TC heads."
19:10;19:13;"Maybe they're a college student, couldn't go home for some reason."
19:13;19:18;"They're renting in some like funky house off campus, just alone."
19:18;19:22;"They're not getting any old wisdom, not from their family and not from their old professors"
19:22;19:23;"either."
19:23;19:24;"So we need more old wisdom on the program."
19:24;19:27;"Nick, didn't the interview with Salts inspire you to start drawing?"
19:27;19:29;"Oh yeah."
19:29;19:32;"I'm drawing a drawing a day at least."
19:32;19:33;"That's amazing."
19:33;19:36;"When he said we just need bad art, like that just-"
19:36;19:38;"You're like, can do."
19:38;19:41;"You know, I was texting you guys while it was happening."
19:41;19:44;"In real time, I was like, this is so inspiring."
19:44;19:47;"To have someone say, make something, it doesn't matter if it's good or bad."
19:47;19:54;"He kept saying, draw pictures of your Nona or just, I felt like anything he was saying"
19:54;19:57;"in that moment was just cutting through."
19:57;20:00;"Are you finding that drawing is changing your perception slightly?"
20:00;20:01;"Yeah."
20:01;20:06;"I think that just doing that and making it routine, like it's grounded me a bunch and"
20:06;20:10;"giving me some sense of like, you know, I got my work, but like, it's definitely like"
20:10;20:11;"calming me down."
20:11;20:14;"And yeah, a definite sense of perspective in the artistic way too."
20:14;20:16;"It's like I'm drawing pictures of my friends."
20:16;20:19;"So I'm like looking at pictures of people I know."
20:19;20:22;"Basically, I'm just drawing pictures of people I FaceTime with."
20:22;20:28;"Can you draw us and then we can use it on Twitter as like the promo for this show?"
20:28;20:30;"Yeah, I'll do this."
20:30;20:33;"You know, there's a lot of information going on on this FaceTime."
20:33;20:36;"You know, there's five of us."
20:36;20:37;"That's like-"
20:37;20:38;"Need a cool picture."
20:38;20:39;"It's a big bite of the apple."
20:39;20:40;"I'll send you guys some stuff I'm doing."
20:40;20:41;"But yeah, you know what?"
20:41;20:42;"That's my thing for tomorrow."
20:42;20:44;"I'm going to draw this FaceTime."
20:44;20:54;"But I do, I highly recommend you listen to Daddy Saul's and you just do something creative"
20:54;20:55;"that's outside."
20:55;20:56;"Like I'm not an artist."
20:56;20:57;"Like I'm not Jake."
20:57;21:02;"I mean, I drew a little bit before, but I will say even doing something that you know,"
21:02;21:04;"it's a little embarrassing, right?"
21:04;21:06;"Like you're not used to doing it."
21:06;21:11;"It's not like all of us that do something that we feel that we do pretty well."
21:11;21:14;"That's what's interesting about Jerry Saltz is like, and it's true of a lot of teachers."
21:14;21:18;"It makes me think of like the Kung Fu movie or something where he's very encouraging of"
21:18;21:21;"people just to get to work, go do it."
21:21;21:22;"It might not be good."
21:22;21:28;"And I think sometimes there's, you have a brand, this is not Jerry Saltz at all, but"
21:28;21:34;"you have this brand of kind of like Instagram hustle culture, like fake guru dudes who are"
21:34;21:37;"just like, bro, get to work, start grinding."
21:37;21:40;"Once that happens, you're going to see great things happening."
21:40;21:43;"And the Jerry Saltz of the world, especially when you read his book and you kind of look"
21:43;21:49;"at the way he talks, he's interesting because on the one hand he's very encouraging."
21:49;21:50;"Get to work."
21:50;21:51;"Come on."
21:51;21:57;"It doesn't matter if it's bad, but he's also an art critic with hardcore opinions who thinks"
21:57;21:59;"a lot of shit is terrible."
21:59;22:03;"And so I kind of like that duality where it's kind of like, get to work you big babies."
22:03;22:05;"Like yeah, start making stuff."
22:05;22:06;"Make that art."
22:06;22:07;"You're like, all right, cool."
22:07;22:11;"Because if you hear it one way, you could hear it through the lens of like an encouraging"
22:11;22:14;"teacher who's like, there's no such thing as bad art."
22:14;22:16;"But Jerry Saltz is not saying there's no such thing as bad art."
22:16;22:18;"He's just saying, just get to work."
22:18;22:19;"See what happens."
22:19;22:24;"And that's why I like that he's got like the softness and the harshness."
22:24;22:29;"And in some ways, that's what a teacher or a guru or an inspiration does is kind of like"
22:29;22:32;"get you hyped up, but also like prepare you for the world."
22:32;22:34;"And the world is like complicated like that."
22:34;22:36;"You need that inspiration just to get going."
22:36;22:38;"But also you're always getting knocked around."
22:38;22:40;"That's like what the creative process is."
22:40;22:44;"You have to get going just to start, but you also have to be getting like knocked down."
22:44;22:49;"So when he says make bad art, I've been thinking about that a lot."
22:49;22:52;"Sometimes the fear of making bad art stops people from doing anything."
22:52;22:55;"And you have to just get in there and you got to get used to being knocked around a"
22:55;23:01;"little bit because like, yeah, he's not exactly a kind vibe dude."
23:01;23:03;"He's not somebody who's like, art is important."
23:03;23:04;"I love everything."
23:04;23:06;"He very quite literally doesn't."
23:06;23:10;"Yeah, it's interesting because there is a conflict a little bit because he's sort of"
23:10;23:15;"like every single person is creative, every single bone and every person is creative."
23:15;23:20;"But he's also acknowledging that most stuff is not good."
23:20;23:24;"So he's like, sort of like most people are bad artists, but it doesn't really matter"
23:24;23:25;"if it's bad."
23:25;23:29;"I think his overall vibe is it doesn't matter if it's bad."
23:29;23:30;"It's okay."
23:30;23:31;"Keep doing it."
23:31;23:32;"You might get good."
23:32;23:33;"You might not."
23:33;23:35;"It's the journey, not the destination, all of that."
23:35;23:37;"So yeah, he's a funny."
23:37;23:40;"To him, the artistic journey is about improvement."
23:40;23:44;"One thing that I thought I liked in his book too is that he says like, you know, how to"
23:44;23:46;"deal with criticism."
23:46;23:48;"He's like, trust me, everybody's had bad criticism."
23:48;23:51;"And he gives examples of like great artists who like on each other's work."
23:51;23:54;"He's like, now we consider all these people masters, but they hated each other."
23:54;23:58;"And Manet said that whoever sucked, whatever."
23:58;24:03;"So he's kind of saying like, when you get bad criticism, he's like, on the one hand,"
24:03;24:05;"don't listen to that."
24:05;24:06;"Don't let it get you down."
24:06;24:07;"You got to keep moving."
24:07;24:09;"And also there might be something true about it."
24:09;24:11;"So he's like, they might be right."
24:11;24:12;"Maybe they're."
24:12;24:16;"And I like that duality, because that's the kind of toolbox that you need, where it's"
24:16;24:20;"like get to work, your work might be bad."
24:20;24:21;"Acknowledge that it's bad."
24:21;24:22;"Keep working."
24:22;24:27;"I also want to say there was a thing that I wrote down while you was talking this idea"
24:27;24:30;"of radical vulnerability."
24:30;24:35;"Most people, I mean, you guys, obviously, as a painter and as a musician, and Seinfeld,"
24:35;24:40;"you as a professional social media man, putting out tweets, like you guys are used to putting"
24:40;24:47;"out something creative that you spend time on and having to deal with the reaction and"
24:47;24:50;"being possibly embarrassed by it and wondering."
24:50;24:51;"Most people don't have that experience."
24:51;24:55;"So when you go and you just draw a picture, and you're like, I'm going to maybe, maybe"
24:55;24:56;"I'll show this to somebody."
24:56;24:58;"It's just putting yourself out there."
24:58;25:04;"It's positions you in a vulnerable place that I think is like a really important and cool"
25:04;25:05;"spot to be in."
25:05;25:06;"Right."
25:06;25:11;"Well, and also, I think he's asking people to stand in true vulnerability, because you"
25:11;25:17;"definitely have a phenomenon, which I'm sure at weaker moments in my life, when I was younger,"
25:17;25:22;"I participated in, I've certainly like seen it growing up, and I've certainly seen it"
25:22;25:23;"on the internet."
25:23;25:29;"And vulnerability will be praised in a positive review of art from a fan, a critic, whoever,"
25:29;25:33;"people will be like, this work is important, because the artist was vulnerable."
25:33;25:34;"They're brave."
25:34;25:37;"So there's a part, and I've seen it happen."
25:37;25:40;"I've thought about it a lot and wondered, have I done that at times?"
25:40;25:43;"So I've seen it happen where people take that in, and they're like, alright, so you're supposed"
25:43;25:44;"to be vulnerable."
25:44;25:46;"Okay, well, I'm pretty vulnerable."
25:46;25:51;"Let me just like tell you, put myself out there, and then watch the rewards come in."
25:51;25:55;"And the irony is that I think I had this kind of riff once, where I was saying a similar"
25:55;25:58;"thing about artistic bravery and vulnerability."
25:58;26:02;"There is this funny irony where it's like, to be really vulnerable is not to kind of"
26:02;26:06;"write a song about something really weird that happened to you, and then watch the money"
26:06;26:08;"and high fives roll in."
26:08;26:12;"To be really vulnerable, and to really be really brave is to make something like awkward"
26:12;26:17;"and be unsure about it, and then to show it to people, or release it to the world, and"
26:17;26:19;"have the world be unsure about it."
26:19;26:23;"And some people will be like, yeah, this sucks."
26:23;26:27;"That's actually true vulnerability, and there probably is a lesson in it."
26:27;26:32;"And I think sometimes culturally, it's hard to see that lesson because we routinely see"
26:32;26:37;"things called vulnerable and brave that aren't really vulnerable and brave because there's"
26:37;26:38;"no..."
26:38;26:43;"Generally, things that are universally lauded in a culture weren't that risky."
26:43;26:49;"Somebody had a gut feeling that at that moment, I can do this, and it'll probably work out."
26:49;26:55;"Every day, there's something that somebody makes that's being deeply misunderstood, and"
26:55;26:57;"that is the true bravery."
26:57;27:02;"True vulnerability is different than just one form of vulnerability that gets talked"
27:02;27:04;"a lot about in the discourse."
27:04;27:05;"You know what I mean?"
27:05;27:10;"Which would be sad sack, maudlin, tug on the heartstrings kind of vulnerability."
27:10;27:15;"Because his vibe is like, whatever stupid idea you have banging around in your head"
27:15;27:18;"that keeps popping up, do that."
27:18;27:21;"It's not that it's like, oh my God, I'm talking about this terrible thing I went through."
27:21;27:26;"It's more of like, everyone's going to think this is so stupid, but I keep thinking of"
27:26;27:27;"it."
27:27;27:28;"And often you're correct."
27:28;27:33;"I guess that's the thing that I like to think about is in the movie version, in the Hollywood"
27:33;27:37;"version, somebody has an idea, they think, no, everybody's going to think it's stupid."
27:37;27:41;"Then they finally put it out there, and there's a parade for them."
27:41;27:46;"That's a version of risk and vulnerability that's very appealing because it's really"
27:46;27:49;"more just like believing in yourself or something."
27:49;27:54;"Whereas sometimes when you have that feeling, people are going to think it's so stupid,"
27:54;27:55;"people aren't going to get it."
27:55;28:00;"You're actually right, but the artistic journey still involves allowing that to happen and"
28:00;28:02;"moving forward because some people will get it."
28:02;28:03;"And then you keep on trucking."
28:03;28:09;"I love to think about an alternate reality where Jackson Pollock gets the idea to splatter"
28:09;28:17;"paint all over this huge canvas, which if you step back is kind of a stupid idea."
28:17;28:21;"And it's just, I love the alternate reality where people are just like, ""Why'd you do"
28:21;28:22;"that, man?"
28:22;28:23;"That's dumb."
28:23;28:24;"You just splattered paint on a canvas."
28:24;28:25;"I don't get it."""
28:25;28:26;"Nobody's feeling it."
28:26;28:54;"I'm painting, I'm painting again."

30:20;30:22;"I was like, oh man, I gotta send this to Jake."
30:22;30:25;"And then I forgot until quarantine"
30:25;30:27;"and then it popped in my head a couple of weeks ago."
30:27;30:28;"And I wondered if you,"
30:28;30:30;"this is totally the type of song that either Jake would be"

30:34;30:36;"And anyway, it's called ""Old Hippie"""
30:36;30:38;"by the Bellamy Brothers."
30:38;30:39;"So I sent this to--"
30:39;30:40;"- Wait, so where did you,"
30:40;30:41;"yeah, so like where did you hear it initially?"
30:41;30:43;"- I think it might've just been on like a playlist"
30:43;30:45;"or I might've been listening to some kind of like"
30:45;30:48;"random shuffle mode radio feature"
30:48;30:50;"or something kind of popped up."
30:50;30:53;"So Jake, are you aware of the Bellamy Brothers?"

32:46;32:47;"♪ And he has to wonder why ♪"
32:47;32:49;"- This is like five years after Lennon died."

33:13;33:15;"I think I found this song pretty bizarre"
33:15;33:16;"when I first heard it."
33:16;33:17;"There was something about,"
33:17;33:20;"often as is in the case of good songwriting,"
33:20;33:22;"especially in country music,"
33:22;33:23;"I was kind of on the fence about the song,"
33:23;33:26;"but there is something moving about the end of the chorus."
33:26;33:27;"You're like, ""He's an old hippie is funny,"
33:27;33:30;"""but then he ain't trying to change nobody."
33:30;33:33;"""He's just trying real hard to adjust."""
33:33;33:35;"I was like, ""That's a pretty good summation"
33:35;33:37;"""of being the old hippie who's like,"
33:37;33:40;"""I was fired up like Seinfeld in my teens and 20s."
33:40;33:42;"""We were going to change the world, man."""
33:42;33:45;"And at this point, I'm not even trying to change anybody."
33:45;33:47;"Just seeing if I can change myself enough"
33:47;33:49;"to survive new wave."
33:49;33:51;"- Reagan's America, dude."
33:51;33:52;"- Damn."
33:52;33:53;"- I love the first verse,"
33:53;33:55;"where he's talking about growing his own weed."
33:55;33:56;"- Oh, interesting."
33:56;33:57;"- It's pretty poetic."
33:57;33:58;"- You know what's funny?"
33:58;34:00;"I didn't even think about him growing weed."
34:00;34:02;"So he grows a little garden in the backyard by the,"
34:02;34:04;"oh my God, of course he's talking about weed."
34:04;34:05;"Damn."
34:05;34:07;"- He's consuming what he's growing nowadays"
34:07;34:08;"in self-defense."
34:08;34:09;"He's out there in the twilight zone."
34:09;34:10;"- I'm embarrassed I didn't catch that."
34:10;34:12;"I guess there's a part of me that's just like,"
34:12;34:14;"I'm so used to living in LA."
34:14;34:16;"And even before I lived in New York,"
34:16;34:18;"it's like the era of everybody's got"
34:18;34:19;"a little vegetable box."
34:19;34:20;"There's a community garden."
34:20;34:21;"You know?"
34:21;34:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
34:22;34:23;"- We have a few things planted."
34:23;34:24;"And I was like, ""Oh yeah, he's old hippie."""
34:24;34:25;"He's a crunchy dude."
34:25;34:27;"He likes to grow his own vegetables."
34:27;34:28;"But there was something about it where I was like,"
34:28;34:31;"""He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self-defense."""
34:31;34:33;"And I was like, ""Well, I guess he used to kind of believe"
34:33;34:35;"""the whole world might go organic,"
34:35;34:36;"""but now he's just eating it"
34:36;34:38;"""so he doesn't have to eat a Big Mac."""
34:38;34:40;"That makes me like the song even more"
34:40;34:44;"because now you're picturing this 35-year-old aimless dude."
34:44;34:47;"And it's like, he's not even some cool weed dealer"
34:47;34:48;"or something."
34:48;34:49;"It's just real sad."
34:49;34:52;"It's like, maybe he's living at his parents' home"
34:52;34:53;"or something, and they're not even cool"
34:53;34:54;"with him smoking weed."
34:54;34:57;"And it's just like, ""You know, back when I lived in Berkeley,"
34:57;34:59;"""it was definitely no problem getting weed."
34:59;35:01;"""These days, I kind of just gotta grow my own little plant."""
35:01;35:04;"And you know, just picturing this guy,"
35:04;35:05;"and he's consuming what he's growing nowadays"
35:05;35:08;"in self-defense, 'cause that's also some real (beep)"
35:08;35:11;"when sometimes you smoke weed"
35:11;35:13;"to get high with your friends,"
35:13;35:15;"laugh your head off, have a vibey night,"
35:15;35:17;"throw on some tunes,"
35:17;35:19;"and then some people smoke weed"
35:19;35:20;"just to get through the day."
35:20;35:21;"Actually, a friend of the show, Mero,"
35:21;35:24;"has famously spoken on this"
35:24;35:25;"because he smokes a lot of weed."
35:25;35:26;"And it'd be like, people think like,"
35:26;35:28;"""Oh, I'm such a stoner, ha ha ha."""
35:28;35:29;"And it'd be like, ""Man, I smoke weed"
35:29;35:30;"""just to get through life."""
35:30;35:31;"It's not happy."
35:31;35:34;"It's like, ""I smoke weed half the time."""
35:34;35:35;"- Bake and bake."
35:35;35:36;"- Yeah, ""I smoke weed half the time"
35:36;35:37;"""just to get (beep) done."""
35:37;35:40;"Not because I'm checking out."
35:40;35:41;"It's like a tool."
35:41;35:43;"Now I've got this image of this dude"
35:43;35:46;"in a suburban backyard with his tiny little weed plant,"
35:46;35:49;"and he's just taking a little toke by himself,"
35:49;35:53;"and his 70-something parents are in the house,"
35:53;35:57;"and he's just getting high and just be like, ""Oh, man."""
35:57;35:59;"- I just turned 35, dude."
35:59;36:00;"- Damn."
36:00;36:02;"- 35."
36:02;36:05;"- Also, very, kind of an interesting"
36:05;36:09;"like a socio-cultural commentary on their part"
36:09;36:10;"that he's an old hippie, so you know,"
36:10;36:13;"they talk about John Lennon, he liked Woodstock-type music,"
36:13;36:16;"but they specifically say he gets off on country music"
36:16;36:18;"'cause disco left him cold."
36:18;36:21;"I think there's still kind of like versions of that dude,"
36:21;36:23;"the 35-year-old dude who's like,"
36:23;36:25;"""Yeah, you know, I've been actually listening"
36:25;36:27;"""to a lot of golden age of country stuff."
36:27;36:29;"""Yeah, you know, when I was in my 20s,"
36:29;36:31;"""you wouldn't have caught me listening to country, but--"""
36:31;36:33;"- Dude, I'm that guy."
36:33;36:35;"- It's basically Jake gets off on country music"
36:35;36:36;"'cause EDM left him cold."
36:36;36:38;"- Oh, absolutely."
36:38;36:39;"(laughing)"
36:39;36:40;"I don't fully own that."
36:40;36:41;"I was not, I mean--"
36:41;36:43;"- He's got young friends into trap music,"
36:43;36:45;"but he's just too friggin' old."
36:45;36:47;"(laughing)"
36:47;36:51;"- He dreams at night of shows from the 90s."
36:51;36:54;"- Oh, GBV, wait, what's like a Portland venue"
36:54;36:56;"GBV would've played at in your day?"
36:56;36:58;"- Burbati's Pan."
36:58;37:00;"- And he dreams at night of Burbati's Pan."
37:00;37:01;"(laughing)"
37:01;37:03;"So this is somebody born in the 50s."
37:03;37:06;"So they're 18 in 1968, perfect timing to like,"
37:06;37:09;"enter adulthood with like all that stuff going on"
37:09;37:11;"politically, musically."
37:11;37:14;"And then this guy couldn't get down with disco,"
37:14;37:16;"which is like a little wack, like, come on,"
37:16;37:19;"Bee Gees have some great songs, man, what's wrong with disco?"
37:19;37:21;"But anyway, he's also like, doesn't like where rock's heading"
37:21;37:23;"so he's like, ""I guess I'm in the country now."""
37:23;37:25;"Probably a lot of people like that."
37:25;37:26;"- You're talking to one."
37:26;37:28;"- You're just an old hippie."
37:28;37:30;"- Okay, let's hear verse two."
37:30;37:31;"- Yeah, yeah."

37:35;37:38;"♪ That everyone was hip ♪"

37:44;37:47;"♪ On his senior trip ♪"

38:02;38:05;"♪ But he just can't change no more ♪"
38:05;38:07;"- That's a beautiful verse."

38:08;38:09;"- That's deep."
38:09;38:10;"♪ 'Cause he's an old hippie ♪"

38:28;38:30;"- All right, so let's look at that verse."
38:30;38:33;"He was sure back in the '60s that everyone was hip."
38:33;38:35;"Then they sent him off to Vietnam on a senior trip."
38:35;38:37;"He was kind of like a high school hippie."
38:37;38:38;"- Yeah."
38:38;38:41;"- 'Cause I'm sure there's definitely like the figure"
38:41;38:45;"of the kind of like straight-laced, I believe in America,"
38:45;38:48;"kind of borderline right-wing dude who goes to Vietnam"
38:48;38:52;"and kind of comes back as a, I guess, like Rambo-esque."
38:52;38:54;"He didn't go to Vietnam as a hippie."
38:54;38:59;"He came back from Vietnam disillusioned and hippie-ish."
38:59;39:00;"- Right."
39:00;39:01;"- But he's saying he thought everybody was hip."
39:01;39:02;"So I'm picturing like he's a dude who's like,"
39:02;39:05;"""Man, it's the '60s, man."
39:05;39:06;"""Everything's groovy."
39:06;39:09;"""Acid's gonna like open up everybody's minds."
39:09;39:14;"""We're not gonna have money or cops by 1973"
39:14;39:16;"""based on my calculations, man."""
39:16;39:19;"So he's kind of like a little bit flower power."
39:19;39:21;"And then Vietnam just like (beep) him up."
39:21;39:24;"And he's like, he still believes in the '60s,"
39:24;39:28;"but behind each wave of tragedy, he waited for the joy."
39:28;39:29;"Now this world may change around him,"
39:29;39:31;"but he just can't change no more."
39:31;39:32;"That's some real (beep) is just being like,"
39:32;39:34;"""I'm out of gas, man."
39:34;39:37;"""I was psyched on the hippie wave."
39:37;39:39;"""I was like psyched on where it was heading."
39:39;39:41;"""Vietnam kind of threw me off, but I came back"
39:41;39:42;"""and I was kind of like getting back"

39:50;39:51;"I mean, that's heavy."

40:51;40:56;"- It'd be easy to write a novelty song about old hippies,"
40:56;41:01;"but they really, it's a very sympathetic portrait."
41:01;41:02;"- Yeah, right. - And very nuanced."
41:02;41:05;"I wonder if these guys are,"
41:05;41:06;"like, are they singing about themselves?"
41:06;41:08;"I don't know anything about the Bellamy brothers."
41:08;41:12;"Maybe they had friends or they themselves."
41:12;41:14;"- You know, I just kind of assumed, maybe it's my bias."
41:14;41:17;"I was just kind of like, well, these are real country dudes."
41:17;41:20;"So maybe they kind of looked at the hippies"
41:20;41:22;"with just sympathy."
41:22;41:24;"Like, maybe these guys are kind of like,"
41:24;41:26;"well, hell man, I'm glad you like country music now,"
41:26;41:29;"but you really went through it, didn't you?"
41:29;41:30;"'Cause yeah, I agree,"
41:30;41:32;"especially 'cause there's that strain of country music"
41:32;41:33;"that's anti-hippie."
41:33;41:35;"- Right, right. - Famously, people"
41:35;41:38;"interpreted Merle Haggard, some of his hits."
41:38;41:40;"What's his famous song?"
41:40;41:42;"- ""Okie From Muskogee."" - ""Okie From Muskogee."""
41:42;41:44;"That was interpreted, I think he went on record"
41:44;41:45;"being like, that's not an anti-hippie song."
41:45;41:50;"- I'm still not clear on the original intent of that song."
41:50;41:53;"If that was ironic or not."
41:53;41:54;"You know, I've heard stories that like,"
41:54;41:56;"that like Grant Parsons had approached him"
41:56;41:58;"to try to produce his first record."
41:58;42:01;"And like, he took one look at like long haired,"
42:01;42:04;"hipster Grant Parsons and was like, not interested."
42:04;42:08;"- Guys, in 2020, so right now."
42:08;42:09;"- Yeah, Bellamy's."
42:09;42:14;"- The Bellamy's have opened up a cannabis."
42:14;42:15;"- A dispenser?"
42:15;42:19;"- A cannabis product called Old Hippie Stash."
42:19;42:20;"- Oh, hell yeah."
42:20;42:22;"- Although yeah, I wanna talk to the Bellamy brothers"
42:22;42:26;"if we can track him down, because now that weed is,"
42:26;42:29;"you know, thankfully, way less criminalized"
42:29;42:31;"around the country, legal in many places."
42:31;42:34;"You do find all sorts of people like Toby Keith"
42:34;42:36;"kind of rebranded as like a weed dude."
42:36;42:39;"Toby Keith who famously gave the Dixie Chicks so much (beep)"
42:39;42:41;"for like making the pretty obvious case"
42:41;42:43;"that the war in Iraq was (beep) up"
42:43;42:46;"and Bush was a bad man for it."
42:46;42:47;"And Toby Keith went so hard at them"
42:47;42:51;"and he wrote his kind of like corny, patriot, you know,"
42:51;42:51;"songs."
42:51;42:55;"♪ Well I proudly stand up ♪"
42:55;42:56;"- And I feel like then you have one that said,"
42:56;42:58;"♪ We'll put a boot in your ass ♪"
42:58;42:59;"It's the American way."
42:59;43:02;"We should do a Toby Keith deep dive at some point,"
43:02;43:04;"because what I remember hearing,"
43:04;43:06;"this is in the early 2000s, was everybody's like,"
43:06;43:10;"Toby Keith emerged as the (beep) Dixie Chicks,"
43:10;43:13;"ride or die for America, let's put our boots"
43:13;43:16;"in some like Iraqi asses, like that was his vibe."
43:16;43:18;"And then I remember it was this kind of like"
43:18;43:21;"bombshell uncovering when somebody found out"
43:21;43:23;"that he was a registered Democrat."
43:23;43:24;"- God."
43:24;43:25;"- This is just a vague memory I have,"
43:25;43:27;"but I remember my takeaway being like,"
43:27;43:29;"oh, so this is like a dude who probably"
43:29;43:30;"is not even that right wing"
43:30;43:33;"and probably was just kind of like saw an opportunity"
43:33;43:36;"to like turn the Dixie Chicks into villains"
43:36;43:38;"and kind of own that space."
43:38;43:40;"So I remember when I happened to catch"
43:40;43:43;"one of his like weed videos, like 15 years later,"
43:43;43:47;"I was just kind of like, he's like a Trump-esque opportunist."
43:47;43:48;"- Yeah."
43:48;43:50;"- But anyway, so I wonder if with the Bellamy brothers,"
43:50;43:53;"they always were kind of like stoner hippie dudes,"
43:53;43:54;"or it was like later on, they were like,"
43:54;43:57;"well, remember that song we had that we,"
43:57;43:58;"'cause like maybe they interpret the song"
43:58;44:00;"totally differently, for us it's like,"
44:00;44:03;"it's a sweet, kind portrait, which I think it is,"
44:03;44:05;"but it's also possible that for them,"
44:05;44:08;"they're just like, man, can you believe"
44:08;44:11;"they're really legalizing weed all over the country, man?"
44:11;44:14;"And he's like, damn, I want some of that."
44:14;44:16;"Well, remember that song we wrote in the 80s,"
44:16;44:20;"Old Hippie, just mercilessly mocking those losers?"
44:20;44:22;"And we have made a pretty penny in royalties from that song."
44:22;44:24;"I kind of doubt it."
44:24;44:25;"But yeah, I think actually Jake, you uncovered it."
44:25;44:29;"The image of the old hippie in the backyard,"
44:29;44:31;"growing his own little secret stash"
44:31;44:36;"just to get high enough to make it through the mid 80s,"
44:36;44:39;"that's what makes him a kind of like tragic figure"
44:39;44:40;"that you can't help have love for."
44:40;44:42;"So then that third verse,"
44:42;44:44;"when they're talking about him jogging,"
44:44;44:46;"it's not that Huey Lewis, Don Henley,"
44:46;44:49;"kind of like bitter take where it's kind of like,"
44:49;44:53;"man, he used to be (beep) rolling around naked in Woodstock."
44:53;44:57;"Now you're waking up at 6 a.m. to jog before your job."
44:57;44:58;"When I picture this dude,"
44:58;45:00;"I picture like this out of weight dude,"
45:00;45:03;"like jogging at 2 p.m. around his parents' neighborhood,"
45:03;45:06;"just to like, just to get out of the house."
45:06;45:08;"(laughing)"
45:08;45:09;"- I gotta get the blood flowing."
45:09;45:11;"I gotta break a sweat or something today."
45:11;45:13;"- Did you guys know that in 2010,"
45:13;45:17;"the brothers released a song called Jalapenos"
45:17;45:19;"about the problems of political correctness,"
45:19;45:23;"but it was banned from radio because it was too profane?"
45:23;45:24;"- Really? - Oh, damn."
45:24;45:25;"- Oh no. - Yeah,"
45:25;45:27;"and then it became a major YouTube hit"
45:27;45:29;"with almost 3 million views."
45:29;45:30;"- Jalapenos?"
45:30;45:32;"All right, let's hear a little bit of Jalapenos."
45:35;45:39;"- Okay, listen up."
45:39;45:41;"We're gonna tell you just how screwed up everything is."
45:41;45:47;"♪ Well, I loaded up my pickup truck this morning ♪"
45:47;45:53;"♪ Going out to chase down them dollars and them cents ♪"
45:53;45:58;"♪ No, I ain't busting my hump to feed my family ♪"
45:58;46:02;"♪ I'm buying healthcare for illegal immigrants ♪"
46:02;46:03;"(laughing)"
46:03;46:05;"- Oh my God."
46:05;46:10;"♪ Life ain't nothing like a bowl of cherries ♪"
46:10;46:15;"♪ There's too little laughter and too much sorrow ♪"
46:15;46:19;"♪ It's more like a jar of jalapenos ♪"

46:29;46:31;"- All right, I get the picture."
46:31;46:32;"- Interesting."
46:32;46:34;"This video is insane."
46:34;46:35;"- This was the Obama era?"
46:35;46:37;"- 2010."
46:37;46:38;"- Yes."
46:38;46:42;"They have a guy wearing like an Obama mask."
46:42;46:42;"- Oh God."
46:42;46:44;"- They were fired up about the Affordable Care Act."
46:44;46:46;"- Obviously this is an ongoing issue."
46:46;46:51;"Even in California, Governor Newsom was announcing a fund"
46:51;46:54;"to help out quote unquote illegal immigrants."
46:54;46:55;"And you know, exact same thing."
46:55;46:57;"They were like, ""Wait, our tax dollars"
46:57;46:58;"""are gonna help these people."""
46:58;47:01;"And it's like, first of all, a lot of immigrants"
47:01;47:03;"who don't have like official resident status,"
47:03;47:06;"they still pay taxes and they pay into Social Security."
47:06;47:08;"And of course they're doing work"
47:08;47:09;"that everybody benefits from."
47:09;47:12;"So it's a pretty classic right wing tactic"
47:12;47:15;"of being like, ""These freeloaders come into this country,"
47:15;47:17;"""man, and you're paying for them."""
47:17;47:20;"And it's like, ""No, dude, they're keeping your (beep) cheap."
47:20;47:21;"""You goofball."""
47:21;47:24;"- Yeah, so it sounds like after the sympathetic portrait"
47:24;47:26;"of the old hippie in the mid 80s,"
47:26;47:30;"smash cut 25 years later, they're on the Trump train"
47:30;47:32;"before Trump's even a candidate."
47:32;47:34;"- Yeah, maybe their vibe, and listen,"
47:34;47:36;"I don't know if it'd be too controversial."
47:36;47:39;"I'm still down to have the Bellamy brothers on the show."
47:39;47:39;"- Absolutely."
47:39;47:40;"- We'll hold their feet to the fire though."
47:40;47:43;"You know, on TC, we ask the hard questions."
47:43;47:45;"But yeah, maybe they've been like ragging on hippies"
47:45;47:46;"for 20 years."
47:46;47:49;"And like one day, what are the Bellamy brothers first names?"
47:49;47:51;"Seinfeld, got a good number crunch?"
47:51;47:52;"- David and Milton."
47:52;47:56;"- David, no, David and Homer Howard."
47:56;47:58;"- David and Homer, yeah."
47:58;48:00;"- They're from Darby, Florida."
48:00;48:03;"It's like, ""Hey David, yeah Homer?"
48:03;48:05;"""We've been ragging on hippies for about 20 years."
48:05;48:07;"""Oh man, I (beep) hate men."""
48:07;48:09;"But it's like, ""Well, you know what Homer, it's 1985."
48:09;48:11;"""We got Reagan in the White House,"
48:11;48:15;"""and clearly the hippie movement has failed."""
48:15;48:17;"Well, I see what you're saying, man."
48:17;48:19;"It's like, ""You know, call me crazy."
48:19;48:22;"""I'm starting to feel bad for those losers."""
48:22;48:23;"(laughing)"
48:23;48:25;"Maybe there's a song in there."
48:25;48:27;"- Why don't we write like a very nuanced portrait"
48:27;48:29;"of one of them fellas?"
48:29;48:31;"- Yeah, maybe they couldn't have done that in 1968."
48:31;48:32;"They were just like so pissed at the hippies."
48:32;48:35;"By '85, they're like, ""The hippies are clearly villains,"
48:35;48:40;"""but I think we can humanize them a bit"
48:40;48:41;"""now that they're on the ropes."""
48:41;48:44;"You know, 'cause there was one line that stood out to me"
48:44;48:45;"in the song in the final verse,"
48:45;48:48;"'cause him and his kind get more endangered every day,"
48:48;48:51;"and pretty soon the species will just up and fade away."
48:51;48:53;"I'm sorry, here comes a Grateful Dead reference."
48:53;48:54;"Turns out the hippie movement"
48:54;48:57;"might've been a little bit on the ropes in 1985,"
48:57;48:59;"but it did not fade away."
48:59;49:02;"- Ooh! - Because actually--"
49:02;49:04;"- And in fact, we will get by."
49:04;49:05;"- We will get by."
49:05;49:08;"Yeah, so think about that, Bellamy's."
49:08;49:10;"We've really been on a journey with these guys"
49:10;49:12;"in this song, ""Exploder."""
49:12;49:15;"But two years after this, when they're just like,"
49:15;49:16;"""Man, look at these old losers."
49:16;49:18;"""Their whole species is about to fade away."""
49:18;49:21;"You got the Grateful Dead have the biggest success ever,"
49:21;49:23;"reigniting, of course, they were still big"
49:23;49:25;"through the early '80s."
49:25;49:27;"'85, that was like a dark period, right?"
49:27;49:29;"Especially for Jerry. - That's a real ebb."
49:29;49:30;"- '85, '86."
49:30;49:31;"But they were about to come back"
49:31;49:35;"and become the biggest touring band in America,"
49:35;49:37;"bringing a whole new generation,"
49:37;49:41;"in fact, offering some hope to the old hippies"
49:41;49:43;"that they actually will get by."
49:43;49:44;"So the Bellamy's were looking down."
49:44;49:47;"It's like in a movie, the villain's standing over,"
49:47;49:49;"the hero seems just about dead,"
49:49;49:52;"bleeding bullet wounds, got the gun cocked."
49:52;49:56;"It's like, ""Your species is about to fade away, man."""
49:56;49:58;"And you're just like, ""Oh, (beep) what can they do?"""
49:58;50:02;"Boom, first studio album in seven years, ""In the Dark."""
50:02;50:03;"Take that, Bellamy's."
50:03;50:04;"- We gotta talk to these guys,"
50:04;50:06;"'cause I really think this was done"
50:06;50:08;"from the place of love, this song."
50:08;50:09;"It's too good."
50:09;50:13;"- Old hippie, Bellamy Brothers, fascinating song."
50:13;50:16;"So we've talked a bit on the show"
50:16;50:21;"about the COVID era brand Twitter champion,"
50:21;50:23;"which seems to be Stake 'Em."
50:23;50:24;"And so we talked a little bit"
50:24;50:26;"about some of these Stake 'Em threads,"
50:26;50:27;"and we've been getting sent Stake 'Em threads"
50:27;50:30;"for at least, I think, three years."
50:30;50:31;"Does that sound right?"
50:31;50:33;"2017, about when they came on the scene."
50:33;50:34;"- Yeah."
50:34;50:37;"- There's something about some of their tweet storms"
50:37;50:40;"in the COVID era have really elevated them"
50:40;50:42;"for better and for worse,"
50:42;50:44;"because you got a lot of people talking about Stake 'Em."
50:44;50:45;"Even just, you know,"
50:45;50:48;"I did a pretty unusually high degree of preparation"
50:48;50:49;"for this episode."
50:49;50:52;"I spent about five minutes just searching Stake 'Em,"
50:52;50:54;"just to see what the streets were saying."
50:54;50:56;"And when I searched Stake 'Em,"
50:56;50:57;"and I looked at the news."
50:57;50:58;"- On Twitter?"
50:58;51:00;"- No, I again used Google,"
51:00;51:02;"but this time I didn't click over to images,"
51:02;51:04;"'cause I wasn't that, I know what Stake 'Em look like."
51:04;51:06;"I was interested in the top stories."
51:06;51:09;"And just think, in the past 48 hours,"
51:09;51:11;"these are two of the top stories that come up"
51:11;51:13;"when you search Stake 'Em."
51:13;51:16;"One is from Tech Dirt, and it says,"
51:16;51:18;"""How Stake 'Em became the tweeting voice of reason"
51:18;51:20;"in a pandemic?"""
51:20;51:22;"So they're giving them like props."
51:22;51:24;"Like, you know, that's exactly what I imagine"
51:24;51:25;"Stake 'Em was hoping for."
51:25;51:27;"Just like people being like,"
51:27;51:28;"""Hey guys, I know it's funny,"
51:28;51:31;"but Stake 'Em is really speaking some truth right now."
51:31;51:33;"And everybody should follow them."""
51:33;51:34;"And then right next to that,"
51:34;51:37;"you have a publication called Spectator USA,"
51:37;51:40;"that published a piece called Burn In Hell Stake 'Em."
51:40;51:41;"- Anti-Stake 'Em's."
51:41;51:42;"- Without even getting into the article,"
51:42;51:43;"the subheading is,"
51:43;51:46;"""Surely they are the last brand from whom to take lectures"
51:46;51:48;"about health and compassion."""
51:48;51:50;"So, you know, right there."
51:50;51:52;"And even when I looked at Twitter a little bit,"
51:52;51:54;"I definitely saw some people"
51:54;51:55;"rolling their eyes at Stake 'Em."
51:55;51:58;"But anyway, you know, Stake 'Em's has been making waves"
51:58;52:01;"in the brand Twitter world for a few years now."
52:01;52:04;"So I imagine they got something to say."
52:04;52:06;"So we're about to get on the phone"
52:06;52:09;"with the person behind the tweets."
52:09;52:11;"His name's Nathan Alibach,"
52:11;52:13;"and he's running that account."
52:13;52:15;"So we're gonna kind of find out what his deal is"
52:15;52:17;"and kind of get in the mix,"
52:17;52:19;"'cause this is a very hot interview."
52:19;52:20;"He's very in demand right now."
52:20;52:22;"So let's get Nathan on the phone."
52:22;52:25;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
52:25;52:28;"(phone ringing)"
52:28;52:31;"- Hey, Nathan."
52:31;52:32;"- Hey."
52:32;52:33;"- Hey, how you doing?"
52:33;52:34;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
52:34;52:35;"- Yes, happy to be here."
52:35;52:37;"- We're very happy to have you."
52:37;52:40;"I'm sure you're getting a lot of requests lately."
52:40;52:43;"The first question, what is your job?"
52:43;52:45;"- Social media manager."
52:45;52:46;"- For?"
52:46;52:48;"- Technically, it's for our family agency,"
52:48;52:51;"Alibach Communications, but representing Stake."
52:51;52:52;"- Okay, so family agency."
52:52;52:55;"Does that mean that your whole family's"
52:55;52:58;"in the advertising business?"
52:58;52:59;"- It's just my mom and my dad."
52:59;53:01;"My dad started it right around the time I was born."
53:01;53:03;"It's a pretty small agency."
53:03;53:05;"It's only under 20 people right now."
53:05;53:08;"So it's just a suburban local thing"
53:08;53:10;"that my parents are involved in."
53:10;53:10;"- That's interesting."
53:10;53:12;"I didn't know that there were that many"
53:12;53:16;"kind of like smaller suburban advertising agencies"
53:16;53:18;"just 'cause like in so many fields"
53:18;53:19;"related to communications,"
53:19;53:22;"you've had these gigantic companies gobble everything up."
53:22;53:23;"- There's really not many."
53:23;53:25;"- So it's pretty unusual to have that."
53:25;53:26;"So what kind of clients"
53:26;53:29;"does Alibach Communications have generally?"
53:29;53:32;"- It's actually pretty much all clients just like Stake 'em."
53:32;53:33;"We've had like, I don't know if you're familiar"
53:33;53:36;"with Uts Snacks, like the chip brand."
53:36;53:38;"- Right, so you guys are Pennsylvania based?"
53:38;53:39;"- Yeah, right outside Philly."
53:39;53:40;"- I grew up in Jersey,"
53:40;53:43;"so I feel somewhat familiar with the Pennsylvania"
53:43;53:46;"'cause Uts is a Pennsylvania brand, right?"
53:46;53:46;"- Yep."
53:46;53:48;"- You guys work with Yingling?"
53:48;53:50;"- No, we actually pitched their business,"
53:50;53:55;"literally the, so I started working for their company 2014."
53:55;53:57;"And it's like a long, boring story,"
53:57;53:58;"but basically like my parents were like,"
53:58;54:01;"""Hey, you should just at least try the business."""
54:01;54:03;"'Cause I never really wanted to work in advertising."
54:03;54:05;"So they offered me like a part-time internship"
54:05;54:06;"while I was doing other work."
54:06;54:08;"And it was right around the time"
54:08;54:10;"they started pitching to get Yingling's business"
54:10;54:12;"and it didn't come through, unfortunately."
54:12;54:14;"But no, they've worked with other brands."
54:14;54:16;"Like we work with Mrs. T's Pierogies."
54:16;54:19;"It's like another frozen comfort food type brand."
54:19;54:22;"So it's mostly food and beverage brands"
54:22;54:25;"that are like what we consider quote unquote legacy brands,"
54:25;54:28;"like old brands that are kind of like dead in today's market"
54:28;54:30;"that we try to like revitalize."
54:30;54:33;"- And they tend to be relatively local,"
54:33;54:35;"like Pennsylvania area."
54:35;54:37;"- Like tri-state area, yeah."
54:37;54:39;"I mean, sometimes we get brands that are like out of state."
54:39;54:40;"I mean, it's just,"
54:40;54:43;"that's probably the exception to the rule I'd say."
54:43;54:47;"- When you say tri-state, which states are we referring to?"
54:47;54:50;"- I mean like New York, Jersey, Delaware,"
54:50;54:53;"just like really anything like right around Pennsylvania."
54:53;54:55;"- On this show, tri-state has a very specific meaning,"
54:55;54:58;"which is New York, New Jersey, Connecticut."
54:58;55:00;"I'm from Connecticut, Ezra's from Jersey."
55:00;55:02;"It's the classic like tri-state area."
55:02;55:05;"So it's interesting to hear as a Pennsylvania guy"
55:05;55:06;"dropping your own tri-state."
55:06;55:09;"- Yeah, I mean, I just always heard it referred to that way"
55:09;55:10;"on the news growing up."
55:10;55:11;"So I guess I just picked up on it."
55:11;55:13;"Maybe it's not like the official terminology."
55:13;55:14;"- No, no, I think you're right."
55:14;55:16;"There's a lot of tri-state areas."
55:16;55:20;"And I think it's partially why Jersey"
55:20;55:23;"is kind of a powerful state is we get to double dip."
55:23;55:26;"Jersey is a part of multiple tri-state areas."
55:26;55:29;"Even though Jersey has no gigantic city,"
55:29;55:32;"Jersey is in between the Philly metro area"
55:32;55:34;"and the New York metro area."
55:34;55:37;"So yeah, the PA tri-state area,"
55:37;55:40;"well, depending what part of Pennsylvania you're from,"
55:40;55:41;"wouldn't really include Connecticut."
55:41;55:42;"They don't share a border,"
55:42;55:44;"but it will definitely include New Jersey."
55:44;55:46;"So you grew up around this family business,"
55:46;55:50;"local Pennsylvania advertising communications agency."
55:50;55:51;"Based on what you're saying,"
55:51;55:53;"it sounds like you were never particularly planning"
55:53;55:55;"on joining the family business."
55:55;55:57;"Until what age?"
55:57;55:59;"- So basically until I had a mental breakdown"
55:59;56:03;"and just lost my job and a bunch of opportunity"
56:03;56:05;"and stuff I had been going through at the time."
56:05;56:07;"I mean, growing up as a teenager,"
56:07;56:11;"I was just like the classic white suburban,"
56:11;56:13;"like middle-class kid who was like rebelling"
56:13;56:16;"against the family, like without a cause."
56:16;56:19;"You know, like it didn't really have any reason to rebel."
56:19;56:21;"I just like, for some reason,"
56:21;56:24;"I think in part because I grew up going,"
56:24;56:26;"like I was really involved in our local music scene."
56:26;56:30;"It was kind of like a post-hardcore metal-ish music scene."
56:30;56:33;"And a bunch of my friends are in bands"
56:33;56:34;"and I got into songwriting through that."
56:34;56:37;"Like that whole scene of people was just always"
56:37;56:40;"very anti-power in some vague sense."
56:40;56:42;"It was never like political, at least not that I remember."
56:42;56:45;"It was just kind of like fight the system."
56:45;56:47;"And I always felt like the advertising industry"
56:47;56:49;"was that system."
56:49;56:51;"So I never like hated my dad for his work per se."
56:51;56:53;"It was never like a personal thing."
56:53;56:55;"So I knew he loved his work and he was great at it."
56:55;56:57;"But I just never saw it as something"
56:57;56:58;"I really wanted to get into."
56:58;56:59;"- No, yeah, of course."
56:59;57:02;"I think on paper, those things seem diametrically opposed,"
57:02;57:05;"but you're actually not the first person with roots"
57:05;57:08;"in punk rock who got into advertising"
57:08;57:09;"who's been on this show before."
57:09;57:10;"- Oh yeah?"
57:10;57:12;"- And people who listened to our Chicago episode"
57:12;57:15;"might remember having a conversation before."
57:15;57:16;"But yeah, that makes total sense."
57:16;57:21;"Like advertising is, I mean, you tell me if this makes sense"
57:21;57:24;"but when I think of punk and hardcore,"
57:24;57:26;"it's about like cutting through the bull (beep)"
57:26;57:27;"and speaking the truth."
57:27;57:30;"And of course, what's the stereotype of advertising?"
57:30;57:31;"It's literally the opposite."
57:31;57:32;"- It's the lie."
57:32;57:34;"- Yeah, it's the lie."
57:34;57:35;"So you were interested in music."
57:35;57:38;"What kind of work were you doing before everything changed?"
57:38;57:40;"Was it something you were passionate about?"
57:40;57:41;"- No, my God, no."
57:41;57:45;"I was, I mean, I jumped from like random local jobs."
57:45;57:47;"I was a landscaper for a while."
57:47;57:49;"I had worked for a reality company."
57:49;57:51;"And I mean, I was always doing music on the side."
57:51;57:55;"Like I was, that was my dream from like the time I was,"
57:55;57:59;"I don't know, like 16 to 22,"
57:59;58:00;"maybe a little before I was 16,"
58:00;58:03;"but like tangibly, like as I got into my late teens,"
58:03;58:04;"I was like, oh, I could like really do this."
58:04;58:06;"It's like really what I want to do."
58:06;58:07;"- You like always had bands?"
58:07;58:09;"- Yeah, I was always either in a band"
58:09;58:11;"or I was always writing my own music."
58:11;58:13;"And I, you know, I sucked as a kid."
58:13;58:15;"I was never like a natural prodigy or anything like that."
58:15;58:17;"But I got better over time."
58:17;58:20;"Like the last album I put out, I was like really proud of."
58:20;58:21;"This is like, you know,"
58:21;58:23;"actually something I would listen to."
58:23;58:26;"- Was that still in the kind of post-hardcore heavy?"
58:26;58:31;"- No, no, this was all like folk, like indie rock type of stuff."
58:31;58:31;"- Oh, okay, all right."
58:31;58:32;"- This was kind of like..."
58:32;58:34;"- What were the band names?"
58:34;58:36;"- I was just always, it was around my name."
58:36;58:37;"- Okay, cool."
58:37;58:39;"- So like, it was the first one was,"
58:39;58:40;"it was called Earl and Rain,"
58:40;58:42;"just my middle name and the middle name of this girl"
58:42;58:44;"that I was singing with at the time."
58:44;58:45;"And it just kind of like evolved from there"
58:45;58:47;"until I just used my full name"
58:47;58:48;"'cause it was just easier that way."
58:48;58:52;"But yeah, no, so I was always doing that with like the goal."
58:52;58:54;"And then eventually I hit a wall where actually,"
58:54;58:56;"ironically I met my now wife"
58:56;58:59;"and realized like I had been putting so much time in my life"
58:59;59:02;"into music thinking like, I'm gonna make it,"
59:02;59:04;"but it was really just eating up my wallet"
59:04;59:07;"at like every opportunity to record"
59:07;59:09;"and end up having to haul my stuff to gigs."
59:09;59:11;"So that was actually the moment,"
59:11;59:12;"as soon as I knew I wanted to marry her,"
59:12;59:16;"I was like, I literally have to put this on the back burner"
59:16;59:18;"and then put all of my creative energy"
59:18;59:20;"into something that's gonna make me money."
59:20;59:21;"- Right."
59:21;59:23;"- So that's like actually like the exact timing"
59:23;59:24;"of when this all happened."
59:24;59:26;"It was kind of like a weird crossroads."
59:26;59:30;"♪ Now I know I have been so anxious ♪"
59:30;59:44;"♪ 'Cause whenever you're around ♪"
59:44;59:47;"♪ I can't trust myself ♪"
59:47;59:52;"♪ With all the windows in my house open ♪"
59:53;59:58;"♪ So I don't wanna be alone with you ♪"
59:58;01:00:06;"♪ No I don't wanna be alone with you ♪"
01:00:06;01:00:12;"♪ It's taking all I have ♪"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"♪ To keep you out of my head ♪"
01:00:15;01:00:19;"♪ I don't wanna be alone with you ♪"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"- So when you first started working at the family,"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"at the family agency,"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"you were, I guess, thankful for the job"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"'cause you're saying you were shifting your priorities"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"to like having something steady and making some money,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"but you weren't exactly psyched about it."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"Is that the vibe?"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"- No, I didn't fit in whatsoever."
01:00:37;01:00:41;"I mean, I joined in 2014 as like an unpaid intern"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"just to like see what it was like."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"And because it is, like I said,"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"it's a small town suburban agency."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"So it's not like what people picture with Mad Men,"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"you know, like New York City, hustle and bustle,"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"people like out competing each other"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"for their jobs every other week."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"The people that have worked with my parents' agency"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"have been with them for like 10, 15, 20 years."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"So I was the youngest person when I came in."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"And it just so happened to be around the time"
01:01:06;01:01:10;"that like brands on social media were getting like more active"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"and I was like, oh, I understand social media"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"'cause I've been promoting my music on it for years"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"and I like let me kind of mess around with this stuff."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"And I never really got into it."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"I mean, like that was my work for years then."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"It just kind of evolved into a position"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"'cause no one there was into social media."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"- So did you immediately start with Stake 'Em?"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"- No, so I started in 2014."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"I was working on brands like Utz"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"and Entenmann's Little Bites."
01:01:34;01:01:37;"And there was a few other like regionally based brands"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"I was working on and it was pretty just mundane."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"I mean, at the time social media was super boring."
01:01:42;01:01:45;"This was like before Amy Brown came in with Wendy's"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"and like did the roast, heard around the world."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"And that kind of blew up what people,"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"like what marketers thought of"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"when they thought of brands on social media."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"There was only a few like that before this."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"So at the time it was just like brands would come to us"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"and be like, hey, we wanna post on these holidays."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"You know, we have this promotion coming up."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"So we basically just put together a content calendar"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"every month, like in advance and send it over to them."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"And that was it."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"Like there was no real time interactions"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"or trying to follow cultural trends."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"It was just like, let's plan a month out"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"and schedule these posts for each day."
01:02:19;01:02:23;"And that was my job until Stake 'Em, which was 2017."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"So literally by the time Stake 'Em,"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"the opportunity came around,"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"I was literally either on the brink of getting fired,"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"which I've had conversations with my parents about since"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"or being like, or just quitting."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"'Cause I just didn't know what I was doing with my life"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"and I didn't enjoy the work."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"It wasn't really something I was into."
01:02:39;01:02:43;"- Even in 2016, before you got the Stake 'Em account,"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"that was already the era of the, you know,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"the Amy Brown era."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"Was it just like a non-starter with us to be like,"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"can I start telling haters to go (beep) themselves?"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"(all laughing)"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"Were you like?"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- No, yeah."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"It's like, I mean, I can't,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"I've never worked in like the high upper echelons"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"of the corporate world,"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"as far as like the Nikes and the Amazons"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"and the Coca-Colas or whatever."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"But all the brands that I have worked with,"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"like on that regional, kind of, like I said,"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"the legacy brand level of just older brands"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"trying to reinvent themselves."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"This is really hard, you know,"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"convincing the people at the top,"
01:03:19;01:03:22;"like this is a good thing that is worth the risk"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"of you jumping into."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"'Cause it is like, a lot of the bigger brands"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"don't even mess with it,"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"'cause it's like a huge risk assessment, you know,"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"to put somebody in charge of something like that,"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"which could be a potential PR nightmare."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"So it was always something that we wanted to obviously"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"have more fun on social media,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"but it was a really, really tough thing to pitch,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"which nowadays it's obviously way easier,"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"'cause there's way more positive examples of it,"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"but not back then."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- By the time you're taking the account,"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"it's owned by like a gigantic company."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"It was invented by the dude,"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"what's his name, Gene Gagliardi?"
01:03:54;01:03:54;"- Gagliardi."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"- Gagliardi, we wanna talk about him in just a minute,"
01:03:56;01:03:59;"but Gene doesn't own it anymore, right?"
01:03:59;01:04:02;"- Yeah, no, it had like, Stakeham had passed hands,"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"I think three or four times since its founding."
01:04:04;01:04:08;"So he sold it in like the 80s or something like that."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Eventually Heinz got it at one point,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"and then Heinz sold it to another company."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- And now it's Quaker made."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"- And now it's Quaker made, yeah."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"- Are they based in Pennsylvania?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- It's based in Redding, yeah, yeah."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- Oh, okay."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"So Stakeham's, even though it's owned by a larger company"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"now, it's still kind of in the family wheelhouse"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"of being a Pennsylvania-based brand."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"How did things get started with Stakeham's,"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"and how did you get the green light"
01:04:32;01:04:36;"to start getting these unusual tweets on?"
01:04:38;01:04:43;"- So in 2017, we had run up our entire yearly budget"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"for our ads by like July or something like that."
01:04:46;01:04:49;"And at the agency itself, where I work,"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"it was just getting pretty slow."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Like we had a couple of clients leave,"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"and we ended up just pitching to the client,"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"like, ""Hey, we have this vacant Twitter account"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"""that we hadn't used for anything"
01:04:58;01:05:02;"""except like a couple of promotions over the years."""
01:05:02;01:05:04;"So we were like, ""Hey, what if we just like logged in"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"""and start messing around on it?"""
01:05:06;01:05:08;"It was like a big trust-building process"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"because obviously we had like the cornerstones"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"of what the brand was supposed to represent."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"Like Stakeham's a family-owned company,"
01:05:15;01:05:19;"and Stakeham, it's kind of like a working-class product"
01:05:19;01:05:23;"that is all about people, but it's like still a corporation."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"There was all these kind of like lines"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"we were trying to draw, you know,"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"to kind of figure out what the voice"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"was supposed to be like."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"But day-to-day, like they gave me the reins,"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"and I just started messing around on it,"
01:05:32;01:05:37;"like introducing the brand to random communities on Twitter"
01:05:37;01:05:40;"and just talking to people and making memes"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"and all the dumb stuff associated with brand Twitter."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"And it eventually just snowballed."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"And as it snowballed, the people over at Stakeham,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"we just had this like relationship of trust"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"like kind of continue to build"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"as the brand got more successful"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"and as they continued to see that we were like"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"being good stewards of it"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"and not just being totally reckless."
01:05:59;01:06:02;"- And so the people that you're mainly talking to"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"who were in charge of the Stakeham brand,"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"obviously they were cool with the idea,"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"but were they were just like, ""That's random as hell,"""
01:06:07;01:06:09;"or were they kind of like, ""Okay, see, you know,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"we're familiar with the Wendy's stuff."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Like we're relatively comfortable with this."""
01:06:13;01:06:16;"Or were they kind of like, ""You're crazy, kid, but (beep) it."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Stakeham's Twitter account isn't really popping,"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"so, you know, give it a shot."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"We don't give a (beep)."""
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- I think it was probably both of those things."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I think they were relatively comfortable with it,"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"but also it had less like a thousand followers"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"and almost none of those followers were active."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"So by the time I got on it, it was just like a wasteland."
01:06:32;01:06:36;"You know, so I think when we initially worked out the idea,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"there was no expectation that this was ever gonna become"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"the thing it is now, obviously,"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"especially because they weren't planning"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"to put any budget behind it."
01:06:43;01:06:47;"So it was just like a, yeah, it was a combination of like,"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"""Hey, you know, we trust you guys."""
01:06:48;01:06:49;"You know, we had been doing,"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"we'd been working with them"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"for about a year and a half or two before that."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"So there was already a relationship there."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"And then, yeah, they were kind of like,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"""Okay, well, there's nothing going on on Twitter anyway,"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"so go for it."""
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- I think I know what it was,"
01:07:00;01:07:04;"but what was the first kind of like Stake 'Em Twitter moment"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"that like really made waves?"
01:07:05;01:07:08;"- It was the Verify Stake 'Em campaign"
01:07:08;01:07:11;"at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"It just kind of like, it climaxed"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"in like the second week of January of 2018"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"when we got verified."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"And that became like this big,"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"I think it was just a slow news day."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"It became like a big news story"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"where the Associated Press picked it up"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"and they aggregated that. - Stake 'Em got verified."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"- Yeah, like it was just like,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"I guess nothing bad is happening in the world for once."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"So like, here's this random story"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"and it got sent to the New York Times"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"and a bunch of other big publications picked it up."
01:07:38;01:07:42;"- So you started with the kind of like slightly lighter fare"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"of just like a little silly kind of just like,"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"""Yeah, verify us, man."""
01:07:46;01:07:50;"'Cause then there was that first viral thread"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"that was about the kind of a meta commentary"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"about why do people want to interact with brands on Twitter?"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"And you talked about the kind of plight of millennials"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"and loneliness."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"That was like phase two kind of?"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"- Yeah, that was about like a year later from all this."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"It was September of 2018."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"And it kind of built to that."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"I mean, obviously like the people that follow the account"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"for those viral moments only catch them as they come up."
01:08:14;01:08:17;"But like in between from like the time we got verified"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"in that January to that September,"
01:08:20;01:08:23;"we had been exploring with some of the meta commentary"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"just because the sort of spheres of people"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"like in weird Twitter that we were operating in"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"would commentate pretty frequently"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"about how either ethically compromised"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"or just bizarre the whole experience of the account was"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"because I was very personable on it."
01:08:38;01:08:42;"So there was always like that kind of underlying factor"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"of me through the account,"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"trying to add commentary about what was happening"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"in real time."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"And that just that big thread that blew up"
01:08:50;01:08:54;"just kind of culminated in the viral sphere, I guess,"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"where everybody was like, ""Oh my God,"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"like what is Stakem doing?"""
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- So you didn't have to go to Stakem and be like,"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"""I'm gonna start getting really philosophical here."
01:09:01;01:09:05;"Are you guys ready for a true Borgesian moment?"""
01:09:05;01:09:06;"And they're just like, ""Well, hold on."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"You gotta talk with the rest of the QuakerMid team."""
01:09:09;01:09:11;"You had basically free reign."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"- Yeah, I had done threads before that one"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"that were pretty similar in nature,"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"just like on like various topics of like polarization"
01:09:18;01:09:22;"and like the disenfranchising of young people and all that."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Like I said, that thread was kind of the culmination"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"of just a lot of the things I've been talking about"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"on the account the past year."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"But yeah, the day that I put it up,"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"I remember it was just like a slow afternoon."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"I had a bunch of time and I was like, ""You know what?"""
01:09:35;01:09:37;"I had these thoughts, like rough thoughts on a notepad."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"And I was like, ""I'm just gonna formulate these"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"into a tweet."""
01:09:40;01:09:43;"And when I hit send, it started blowing up faster"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"than I've ever seen something blow up on the account."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"I was like, ""Oh God, like what is happening?"""
01:09:48;01:09:52;"And it terrified me because I didn't put it through"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"for approval or anything like that."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I just kind of put it into the ether."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"And I had no idea if I was about to like get fired"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"or be praised for something cool."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"So it was a pretty exhilarating, crazy time."

01:10:35;01:10:36;"- One question I have for you,"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"and I guess starting with that moment"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"all the way to the current threads about,"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"also I guess that have to do with reality,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"what one can and cannot believe."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"And it's interesting learning more about your story"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"because we've talked to Amy Brown on the show,"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"one of the OGs of Brand Twitter."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"You know, for her working for Wendy's,"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"you know, it's not the biggest company on earth,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"but it's like a very big company"
01:10:57;01:11:01;"and it's this like very iconic brand that everybody knows."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"So I think if you're Amy Brown,"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"you can't help but recognize that what you're doing"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"is changing the voice of Wendy's"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"because it's a familiar voice."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"We all grew up in Wendy's, right?"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"And you're having fun with it."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"And then we've also talked to Mac from Pluckers."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"I don't know if you know him down in Texas."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"- Yeah, I'm friends with both Amy and Mac, they're great."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"- You guys all know each other."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"It's crazy. - I love that."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"- That's amazing. - Amy said it,"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"it's like the mafia. - It really is like the mafia."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"So with Mac, you kind of, Mac strikes, you know,"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"he's more this like wild man, Hunter S. Thompson,"
01:11:30;01:11:34;"former journalist who's just like, ""(beep) it, gun for hire."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"I'll take this rag tag."""
01:11:36;01:11:37;"But you're somewhere in between"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"because it's like a certain type of person,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"maybe the people with more negative reactions,"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"when they see the Steakums tweets,"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"they're picturing, I feel like,"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"a giant corporate food company"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"hiring a slick advertising agency."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"You know what I mean?"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"'Cause that's like-- - Yeah, mad men."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"- I think that's what a lot of people picture."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"So I guess my question is like, for you,"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"does the fact that you're at the family business"
01:12:01;01:12:05;"with the local product that you're advertising"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"mean you kind of like meld with the account"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"in a way that like probably is not as easy"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"when somebody is doing social media for Wendy's or something?"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"By the time you're writing these kind of,"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"I don't wanna say personal,"
01:12:16;01:12:20;"but as you give Steakums a true voice,"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"what's going through your head?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Is it just you kind of at a certain point?"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Are you melding with it?"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"- No, that's a great question."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"I mean, it is both, I guess you'd say."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"I mean, obviously, they are my thoughts,"
01:12:30;01:12:31;"so I'm putting them out there,"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"but I'm not putting them out there as me"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"in full transparency"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"because I'm still representing the brand."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"So I kind of have to filter my thoughts"
01:12:41;01:12:45;"through whatever semblance of an axiom, I guess,"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"that I can develop as the Steakum brand,"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"which as a company, like you alluded to it there,"
01:12:50;01:12:53;"I mean, obviously Steakum, just like any brand,"
01:12:53;01:12:57;"its bottom line is its most important driving factor."
01:12:57;01:13:01;"It just wants to self-preserve and to grow,"
01:13:01;01:13:02;"but on top of that, obviously,"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"there's the sort of brand storytelling,"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"the propaganda layered on top of that that we use"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"and we see in all sorts of advertising."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"So I have to kind of use that storytelling"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"and then mold that to what I'm thinking."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"And over the past couple of years,"
01:13:16;01:13:17;"like a big part of that has been"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"this kind of unifying message,"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"this like underdog brand,"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"how can we insert ourselves"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"into these cultural conversations"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"in a way that's trying to bring people together."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"So, I mean, obviously, these thoughts,"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"they come from my head,"
01:13:31;01:13:34;"I mean, so they are authentic in that way,"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"but I have tons of thoughts on this stuff."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"I mean, there's a million things, obviously,"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"that I can't and shouldn't say as the brand,"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"but I mean, I try to find the pieces or whatever"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"that fit into these cultural conversations"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"that at the time feel appropriate,"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"even though obviously there's plenty of people"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"who disagree with that"
01:13:53;01:13:56;"and I even disagree with that on a certain point,"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"I'm working with the, like I said,"
01:13:57;01:14:01;"the sort of axiom of the company I'm representing."
01:14:01;01:14:05;"I can't really operate under my own ethical frameworks,"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"you know what I mean?"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"Like I'm having to think of this as Stake 'Em, you know?"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"- Right, and have you, well, in your personal life,"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"are you somebody who tends to be politically engaged,"
01:14:15;01:14:19;"interested in philosophy and the, you know,"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"the things that kind of dovetail with the Stake 'Em stuff?"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"- Yeah, it's like literally all I'm interested in."
01:14:25;01:14:29;"It's like day to day, I mean, that's my sports essentially."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"So, I mean, yeah, that's why that's inserted itself"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"the way it has into the brand voice"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"because day to day, that's kind of like the subcultures"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"that I'm operating in online."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"So I constantly thinking in that mode"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"and experiencing, you know, the tensions"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"between various, you know, political"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"and just general ideologies and how to navigate that"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"'cause I'm a pretty confrontational person,"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"like I'm pretty outspoken with what I think,"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"but at the same time, I can be a mediator."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"So like I use the Stake 'Em account as like a place"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"to mediate, you know, and try to listen"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"to what people are saying and like I said, insert."
01:15:02;01:15:05;"- Well, one question, when I saw some of the Stake 'Em stuff"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"I was kind of like, I wasn't sure what to make"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"of some of it because on the one hand, of course,"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"you know, I think most people got to agree"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"with what you were saying about the way in which"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"quote unquote facts can be cherry picked"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"to serve a political agenda."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"But it's like interesting, as I was reading it,"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"I was kind of like, I think you did a good job."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"I'm sure Stake 'Em wouldn't be happy if you were like,"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"you know what, I want Stake 'Em's account"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"to be this particular political ideology."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"They'd be like, okay, now you've gone too far."
01:15:33;01:15:36;"You wrote it in a way where you were kind of making"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"a statement that kind of anybody could agree with."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"But as I was reading it, I was kind of like,"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"I couldn't help but picture, I was like,"
01:15:42;01:15:46;"well, when somebody talks about like believing real facts,"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"it's interesting because on the one hand,"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"like some people might hear that and be like,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"yes, thank you, because we have a president who lies,"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"you know, from a liberal perspective."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"And somebody else might be like, thank you,"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"because we got the New York Times who lies."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"So it's like, as I was reading it,"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"I was kind of like going left and right."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"I don't know if you feel comfortable,"
01:16:03;01:16:07;"but do you have a particular political ideology"
01:16:07;01:16:11;"as a sovereign citizen of the United States?"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"- Well, I guess I shouldn't get too deep into it"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"because I don't want people to like directly associate me"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"and be like, you know,"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"this is what the person represents or whatever."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"I mean, I've always, the past few years,"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"I'd say I've identified as like a social Democrat, I guess."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"I mean, like I'm definitely to the left"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"of like centrist Democrats,"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"but I'm also not like a total leftist,"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"which a lot of like the spheres I run in,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"that's like their driving ideology."
01:16:37;01:16:37;"So I kind of--"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"- Yeah, relatively warm feelings towards Bernie?"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"- Oh yeah, totally."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- Not a hate."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"- And I think like, yeah, no, absolutely not."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"But it's just kind of weird because like I said,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"operating as the stake in my account"
01:16:48;01:16:49;"and just like my day-to-day life,"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"I mean, I grew up in a really like rural,"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"kind of like conservative Christian area."
01:16:54;01:16:58;"Like there's churches on every corner of where I grew up."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"So a lot of the people I'm like still friends with"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"or like have like family connections with,"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"I mean, they're pretty conservative politically."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"And I've always thought they were great people growing up."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"It's not like the kind of stereotypical,"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"I guess, conservatives that you see in the news."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"I mean, obviously we have plenty of just the views"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"that I disagree with them on."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"But as I've gotten older,"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"I guess what I'm trying to say is like,"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"I've been forced in my personal life"
01:17:21;01:17:24;"to navigate the sort of like various political ideologies"
01:17:24;01:17:25;"in my own life."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"So that's kind of translated online in a way"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"where I really, I try not to be an ideologue"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"in the sense where I'm like overtly pushing"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"a political agenda, even though I have personal views."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"Like I just don't view that as like my role online,"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"whereas some people are activists"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"and that's like their entire life and that's great."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"Like obviously we need activists,"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"but that's never been like my calling, I think,"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"especially as somebody who has to represent brands publicly."
01:17:51;01:17:54;"Like I'm not, I don't want people to like follow my work"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"and be like, oh, well he has to have this slant,"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"you know, and that's gonna affect the way"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"he produces content or something like that, you know?"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Right."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"Obviously if the goal of,"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"and certainly one of the major goals"
01:18:06;01:18:10;"of any social media manager is to get people talking,"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"you've succeeded at that with Flying Colors."
01:18:13;01:18:16;"But one thing we talked about with Amy a little bit,"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"and that was, you know, she was on the front lines"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"of this early days (beep) is that for her,"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"the Wendy's account would just get sent"
01:18:21;01:18:24;"like the gnarliest (beep) from the right and the left"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"'cause she would get the hardcore vegans sending her,"
01:18:26;01:18:30;"you know, brutal pictures of, you know,"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"slaughtered animals and then, you know,"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"from the right wing, just people just like,"
01:18:33;01:18:36;"just, you know, real nasty trolls, just disgusting."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- Yeah, like 4chan type trolls."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- Yeah, racist type (beep)."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"I don't think, as far as I've seen,"
01:18:40;01:18:44;"Stakehams has generated that level, but, you know,"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"certainly you have probably every possible opinion"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"about it from people being like, thank you."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"Like we were just saying that, you know,"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"when I'm searching Stakehams,"
01:18:52;01:18:55;"I'm seeing articles being like calling the account"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"the voice of reason in a troubled time,"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"and then somebody being really angry saying burn in hell."
01:19:00;01:19:03;"I hope I'm not ruining your day by telling you about that."
01:19:03;01:19:04;"- I've seen it all, don't worry."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"- Okay, all right, yeah, all right."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"So I guess my question is like,"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"you seem like a thoughtful person."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"What's it like taking all that information in?"
01:19:12;01:19:16;"Is it just like, it's just the job, forget about it?"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"Or is it emotional?"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"Does it get you thinking?"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"Like what's it like?"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"- Oh, it's impossible not to get emotional about it."
01:19:23;01:19:26;"I mean, I've talked to Amy extensively"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"about like her experience, like you mentioned,"
01:19:27;01:19:30;"just the trolls that she had to deal with on the account."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"And for most of what she did, I mean, her name,"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"I think her name became public"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"as soon as the tweets went viral."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"So she started getting personal attacks as well,"
01:19:38;01:19:42;"like right after the initial viral moment."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"And it's been the same for me."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"I mean, like my name has been attached to this"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"from the very first moment we have,"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"because obviously like, you know,"
01:19:49;01:19:52;"the people behind the account, that's like the big question,"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"you know, as much as we wanna make it about the brand"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"from an advertising perspective, you know,"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"it's like every reporter is like,"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"well, who's behind this account?"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"So as soon as my name became attached to it,"
01:20:02;01:20:05;"I mean, there's just like this cohort of,"
01:20:05;01:20:09;"I'll say like specifically politically motivated ideologues"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"like in like the leftist sphere."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"It's not obviously all leftists,"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"it's like a specific subculture."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Some people call it the dirtbag left"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"or the (beep) posting left."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"So there's like a bunch of these accounts"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"who they have it out for me"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"and they've had it out for me for years,"
01:20:25;01:20:29;"but each time there's like a viral moment like this,"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"it just kind of gets more and more vitriolic."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Like you called me in like a crazy time to record this"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"because just a couple of days ago,"
01:20:35;01:20:39;"one of these accounts posted a fake rape accusation about me"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"like with my name and everything on the account."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"And I had to like track this guy down"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"and like find his info and like call him"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"and be like, take this down."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"And he's like, eventually he took it down and apologized"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"and said like he had got hacked"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"and who knows like what the hell happened there."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"But like a bunch of these accounts,"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I mean, they send me death threats."
01:20:58;01:21:01;"I mean, they're sending like just insane stuff,"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"like finding information about my family"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"and posting it everywhere."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"Like it's just a very--"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"- And these are people that you assume"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"are or they identify as being more left wing, so--"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"- Yeah, yeah, I don't need to, I don't assume it's all--"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"- No, yeah, well, right."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"But it's a bit ironic, although, you know,"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"life in modern America, late capitalism,"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"whatever you wanna call it, is often ironic."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"It's not like these like hardcore communists"
01:21:23;01:21:26;"are just like, we're outing the crypto fascist"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"behind Stakehams."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Your political views,"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"you're probably not a billion miles away from these people."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Although we often talk on this show"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"about the narcissism of small difference,"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"where sometimes the closer you are, the further--"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"- Yep, no, I know."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"- The more differences are magnified."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"But when you, you know, I'll be honest,"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"we had this discussion too,"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"where we were just kind of talking about like,"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"well, yeah, is there just like the ceiling"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"for how much a brand Twitter can like speak the truth?"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"'Cause there's always just this ceiling of like,"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"yeah, but it's still a company."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"And you do often reference that."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"Is that just like that final thing"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"that as long as you're trying to sell"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"frozen emulsified beef, just like,"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"they can never take any of the accounts commentary seriously"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"because there's a profit motive?"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"And if so, are you understanding of that?"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Or are you kind of like, eh, that's not really fair?"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"- No, absolutely."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"I mean, like I honestly empathize"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"with a lot of the people that troll me."
01:22:19;01:22:23;"And that's like been in part why I haven't like lashed out"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"the way I probably could have or should have"
01:22:25;01:22:26;"in a lot of these instances."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"'Cause I try to think about, you know,"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"like why are these people like motivated"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"to do this toward me?"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"And I totally get it."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"I mean, a lot of them are following"
01:22:33;01:22:36;"like the classic Chomsky model of propaganda"
01:22:36;01:22:39;"and they're not wrong in the sense where, you know,"
01:22:39;01:22:42;"my job as an advertiser is to blur the lines"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"between what a brand is and what a person is"
01:22:45;01:22:49;"and how to like obscure information in a way"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"that like gets people to feel something."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"So like, obviously like no matter how meta I get with steak"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"and like no matter how many times I say"
01:22:56;01:22:59;"we're frozen beef sheets or, you know,"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"talk about how we're a brand with a bottom line,"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"which I do all the time,"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I can raise that awareness for people"
01:23:05;01:23:08;"and like get people to think about the fact"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"that they're being advertised to,"
01:23:09;01:23:12;"but it still has the same net effect of propaganda"
01:23:12;01:23:15;"where then that meta commentary becomes like"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"a deeper layer of connection"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"where then people feel like"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"they're having a parasocial relationship with the brand."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I refer to it as like the next evolution"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"of brand connection in the sense where,"
01:23:26;01:23:29;"yeah, in the beginning maybe it was like mascots, right?"
01:23:29;01:23:32;"Like fast food places had mascots to personify themselves"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"on commercials and everything like that."
01:23:35;01:23:37;"And there's obviously like this experiential aspect"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"of how brands try to get you to like feel"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"like you're part of an experience"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"and so you don't think about what it is you're buying"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"or what you're participating in like Disney World"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"or something like that."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"And then you have influencers and people that do like,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"even like shows like this,"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"like any kind of show where there's like advertising,"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"something to like get people to not think"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"about what it is they're buying,"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"but rather just like actually enjoy"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"how the information is coming to them,"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"whether it's from somebody they like"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"or just something that makes them feel good."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"So no matter what I do,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"I'm always gonna be obscuring that,"
01:24:07;01:24:10;"which is an ultimate net bad"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"in the view of a lot of these people."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"And in my own view too,"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"the only difference is obviously I work in this industry,"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"so I have to like operate within it."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"I guess I also just have more of a,"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"I don't know how you say it,"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"like it's more of like a contentious approach"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"where I view like these are the broader systems"
01:24:28;01:24:31;"we live under and they aren't stopping anytime soon."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Like me quitting my job isn't stopping"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"the system of advertising,"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"like it's always gonna be evolving into the next thing"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"and on a global scale, not just like in the US."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"So to me, it's like,"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"we're all part of the propaganda model"
01:24:44;01:24:47;"and I'm just one of its like leading"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"or worst perpetrators of it,"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"however you wanna come out looking at that."

01:25:36;01:25:38;"- Well, one last thing that I'd like to talk with you about,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"you've been talking about how the Stake 'Em accounts"
01:25:40;01:25:44;"with some lefties, but we're curious,"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"do you have any interaction"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"with the aforementioned Gene Gagliardi?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"We understand he's still alive."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"We tried to track him down, but all the numbers were,"
01:25:54;01:25:57;"you know, seemed to be disconnected."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"Because from what we could see,"
01:25:59;01:26:02;"he had a Twitter account at some point."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"He hasn't tweeted in a long time."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"- His last tweet was in 2016,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"and they were all unabashedly on the Trump train."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"So we were wondering, yeah,"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"if there'd been any pushback from the Gagliardi family"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"towards the Stake 'Em's Twitter account."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"'Cause, yeah, I mean-"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"- And they don't own Stake 'Em's anymore,"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"but you know, that often is contentious"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"with intellectual property,"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"is the family that started it wants to make sure"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"that it's being stewarded correctly."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"- Yeah, no, I hate to say it,"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"but we don't have really any contact with him."
01:26:31;01:26:34;"And we've thought about reaching out over some stuff"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"like just to see what his take would be"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"on maybe some of the newer content,"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"like see what he thinks about a lot of it."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"But he's really hard to get ahold of."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"So no, we haven't had any luck."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"- Interesting."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Well, we'll keep trying to get in touch with Gene,"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"and maybe we can broker a sit down,"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"maybe have a political debate."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"(all laughing)"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"One other question,"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"have sales increased the last few years?"
01:26:56;01:26:59;"- Yeah, so we had a sales spike"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"before we even had the Twitter account active."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"So there was already growth there."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"And then each year since we've had it,"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"so it's been like two and a half years,"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"there's been double digit increases,"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"almost always with bumps after these viral moments."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"So there's definitely like a tangent."
01:27:15;01:27:19;"- Wow, I did see some of the replies."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I was looking through some of the recent threads"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"you've put up, and I did see people being like,"
01:27:24;01:27:27;"""You know what, I normally don't buy staycums,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"but I'm gonna go and stock up today."""
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Like people were like,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"you could see it in real time."
01:27:33;01:27:36;"People literally being won over."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"- Yeah, it's super weird."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"- Thanks so much for taking the time, Nathan."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"I hope you'll come back on the show in the future,"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"'cause we're always interested in talking about people"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"actually working advertising."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Yeah, hope you and the rest of the family are staying safe."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"- No, anytime, man."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"- In these, what is it?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Strange and uncertain times?"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"What's the cliche?"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"- Yeah, like these strange and uncertain times,"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"you need a Budweiser."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"(all laughing)"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"- Yeah, in these strange and uncertain times,"
01:27:58;01:28:01;"we hope the whole family agency,"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"and Quaker Made, why not, is staying safe."
01:28:04;01:28:04;"All right, have a good one, dude."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"- Thanks, guys, appreciate it."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"- All right, bye. - See ya."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"- Well, Nathan, fascinating man."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"I was very surprised, Jake,"
01:28:11;01:28:14;"to find out that it's a family agency."
01:28:14;01:28:16;"That changed everything for me."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Yeah, but it makes sense,"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"'cause the voice of the staycums account is so singular,"
01:28:20;01:28:24;"and it's hard to imagine a singular voice like that being,"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"or managing to persevere through a huge corporate structure"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"of a massive advertising agency."
01:28:29;01:28:32;"- Right, local agency, local brand, small and nimble."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"- Makes sense."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"I mean, it's really, yeah,"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"it's really kind of a needle in the haystack"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"in the advertising world,"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"that this guy works for his family,"
01:28:42;01:28:45;"who's run a small agency for decades with local clients."
01:28:45;01:28:48;"It's like, really, everything lined up for this to happen."
01:28:48;01:28:51;"- It does make more sense when you consider the voice."
01:28:51;01:28:54;"Next up, we're gonna get on the phone with Brian Jones,"
01:28:54;01:28:58;"Vampire Weekend guitarist and Chet Hayes enthusiast."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"If you don't remember, Chet Hayes is Tom Hanks' son,"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"who raps and does a pretty good Jamaican patois."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"So Brian's been posting videos"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"where he just kind of amazingly,"
01:29:09;01:29:12;"just like, he goes side by side with Chet Hayes"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"and does his Jamaican patois,"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"but gets the timing perfect."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"- I'm so glad this is happening."
01:29:17;01:29:21;"Those videos are the funniest thing to me."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"I don't know who said it, but it's like a solo."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"It's like, there's something musical about it."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"I was saying that."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"It's like, is it like memorizing"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"the nuances of a guitar solo?"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"- Yeah."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"So anyway, we're gonna check in with Brian, see what's up."
01:29:32;01:29:35;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"(phone ringing)"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"- Hello."
01:29:41;01:29:44;"- Brian, welcome to Time Crisis."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"- We were just wondering if like,"
01:29:45;01:29:49;"memorizing the Chet Hayes videos"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"was like kind of memorizing like a solo,"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"like a Steely Dan solo."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"- I mean, there's a lot of similarities for sure."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"A lot of nuance, a lot of timing."
01:29:59;01:30:00;"- How do you memorize them?"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"You just study them?"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"- Yeah."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"The first one I did in like a day,"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"and then the second one was a little harder."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"And then-"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"- How many takes are we talking?"
01:30:11;01:30:14;"- None of them were more than four takes."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- Okay."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"So one question I have is,"
01:30:17;01:30:21;"Chet Hayes, and I remember you actually telling me this"
01:30:21;01:30:26;"a couple months ago, long before his parents had COVID,"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"long before any of this crazy (beep)"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"and you told me that Chet Hayes,"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"he gets clowned on often by people,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"sometimes for doing his Jamaican patois on the red carpet."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"But you told me that you saw some commentary"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"where a decent number of Jamaicans were impressed"
01:30:42;01:30:47;"by his accent and his correct usage of vocabulary."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"- Yeah."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"I mean, that was kind of like a thing,"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"I can't remember all the channels I saw it on,"
01:30:54;01:30:55;"but you would see it and like,"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"people talking about it."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"And I have one friend who's Jamaican,"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"who was like, yeah, that's like, that's it."
01:31:01;01:31:05;"Like he has, I think he has an above average knowledge"
01:31:05;01:31:09;"of the vocabulary than most like regular white people."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"- My question is that, you know,"
01:31:11;01:31:15;"just like any dialect, the grammar, the phrases,"
01:31:15;01:31:18;"the words can be highly specific."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"So was it hard to transcribe it?"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Or is it all up on genius.com,"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"Chet Hayes red carpet speech?"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"- I must say, I think it was a bit of a pioneer"
01:31:27;01:31:30;"and you know, as far as like transcribing the texts"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"and the speeches,"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"but I've been hearing a lot of that (beep)"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"my whole life sort of."
01:31:35;01:31:37;"And yeah, I don't know, I just knew it."
01:31:37;01:31:39;"- You didn't get stumped on anything?"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"- I think there was like one thing that I fully like,"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"I didn't mess it up,"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"but I like added an end to a word that wasn't there"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"that I just thought was there."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"For the most part, it was kind of just, it was there."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"- It really does have a lot in common"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"with transcribing music, like adding an end by accident."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"You're like working hard to like figure out"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"the way somebody phrased some chords."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"You're like, I really think I got it."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Then finally somebody shows you how to do it."
01:32:02;01:32:06;"You're just like, oh my God, that note's just not in there."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"I don't know exactly if this is the timeline,"
01:32:08;01:32:11;"but you did post these videos right after you posted"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"yourself nailing a Steely Dan guitar solo."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"- I will say this, this quarantine for me has been all"
01:32:16;01:32:19;"about knowledge and learning things and educating myself."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"So I guess you can say those went right hand in hand."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"- You consider yourself a millennial, right?"
01:32:25;01:32:28;"- I think I am considered a millennial."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"- Not sure."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"- I guess."
01:32:31;01:32:32;"- You feel like on the fence."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"- I think I'm in the timeframe."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"I'm 26."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"- Yeah, you're definitely."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"- That's, yeah."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"- You're definitely not a silverback millennial,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"but yeah, you're on the outer edge of it."
01:32:40;01:32:44;"So we're curious about, yeah, for you during quarantine,"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"'cause we're all older and I've wondered like,"
01:32:47;01:32:50;"you're mid twenties quarantined."
01:32:50;01:32:53;"What's that like for your generation?"
01:32:53;01:32:58;"Got roommates, normally people your age are out partying,"
01:32:58;01:33:01;"skateboarding, I don't know."
01:33:01;01:33:02;"Do you feel like there's a different vibe"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"to be 26 in quarantine?"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"- There's probably, yeah,"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"there's probably slight differences,"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"but we're just kind of, you know,"
01:33:09;01:33:12;"I mean, I live with three other people."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"It's maybe a little different, but I mean,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I'm inside all the time."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"I like didn't even start going out like walking"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"until like three days ago,"
01:33:19;01:33:22;"'cause I was just like ultra paranoid for a while."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"- Yeah, fair enough."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"- I think that the one thing that will happen"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"in my generation, it's kind of started happening,"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"that might be a slight difference,"
01:33:29;01:33:32;"is that I think once people feel like they don't have it,"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"they're kind of just like, oh, I mean,"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I've been chilling for like two weeks by myself."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"I don't have it."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"Like, and my friend, my other friend right here"
01:33:38;01:33:39;"doesn't have it."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"So like, let's hang out."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"I think that's probably gonna start happening sooner"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"for my generation."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"- And this person I'm talking to on Tinder"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"who lives three miles away,"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"they said they've been quarantined too."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"So let's party."
01:33:50;01:33:55;"- I mean, I've heard and have had firsthand retellings"
01:33:55;01:33:59;"of things about like, a lot of people are, you know,"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"reaching horny levels that are crazy,"
01:34:01;01:34:04;"that are driving them to, you know,"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"and it's like, yeah, I went on a walk with somebody"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"and then on the hinge at the Silver Lake Reservoir."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"And then, but you know,"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"people are a little bit."
01:34:13;01:34:16;"- People are doing like six feet away mask walks"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"with people they meet on it."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"- People doing six feet away mask walks."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"And then people are like, you know,"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"just telling each other, it's like, yeah,"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"I'm sure I don't have it."
01:34:22;01:34:26;"And then hanging out."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"- I mean, it was bound to happen."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"- Hell yeah."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"- But you've been focusing on educating yourself,"
01:34:33;01:34:37;"Steely Dan solos, Chet Hayes monologues, anything else?"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"- I've been tie-dying a bunch"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"and I was gonna do this thing for the 20th anniversary"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"of the No Strings Attached album,"
01:34:44;01:34:47;"where I was gonna try to put out like a cover EP of-"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"- Hold on, pause for one second."
01:34:49;01:34:52;"Jake, do you know what album he's talking about?"
01:34:52;01:34:55;"- I was just racking my brain."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"No Strings Attached, it sounds very familiar."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"- The 20th anniversary is when, Brian?"
01:34:59;01:35:00;"- So it's 2000."
01:35:00;01:35:03;"- The 20th anniversary was March 21st."
01:35:03;01:35:06;"- March of 2000."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"- Can I give you a hint?"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"- Yeah."
01:35:08;01:35:11;"- It broke first week sales records."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"- Is it rock?"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"- No."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"- Is it hip hop?"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"- No."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"- It's not rock, it's not hip hop."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"- I'll give you another hint."
01:35:19;01:35:22;"It's not nearly as cool as you might think it is."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"- Think about it, 2000, people just chomping at the bit,"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"a very passionate fan base."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"- MTV, everywhere."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"- Oh, it's like a boy band?"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"- Yes."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"- Okay, like Backstreet Boys or NSYNC?"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"- The last, yes."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"- NSYNC."
01:35:38;01:35:38;"- NSYNC."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"- Wow, oh, sorry, okay, so backing up,"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"you're gonna do a No Strings Attached?"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"- Yeah, I'm pretty deep into it at this point,"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"to be completely honest."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"- What are the big hits off that?"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- I mean, Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me."
01:35:50;01:35:51;"- Okay."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"- Those are the two big ones."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Those are the two biggest NSYNC songs, I think."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"But yeah, I've been working on that a bunch too."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"I'm like eight songs deep,"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"and I have a bunch of friends"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"that are gonna record vocals for it."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"It's gonna be great."
01:36:02;01:36:03;"- You're gonna do the whole album?"
01:36:03;01:36:04;"- I was gonna do the whole album."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"I think I'm gonna cap it at eight, though."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"There's three songs that are great,"
01:36:07;01:36:10;"but I think I just wanna limit myself to eight songs."
01:36:10;01:36:14;"But I mean, if we're doing this come like X date,"
01:36:14;01:36:18;"I'm probably just gonna figure out a way to include 'em,"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"'cause might as well."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"- Wait, so the deep cuts on that NSYNC record are good?"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"- Dude, yes, okay."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Wait, just, there's one song you have to check out."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"- I would love to."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"- That is legitimately incredible."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"- Wow."
01:36:31;01:36:34;"- And it's like, I don't remember exactly,"
01:36:34;01:36:35;"but I think it's one of the first songs"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"I've ever sang together."
01:36:37;01:36:41;"It's called ""I Thought She Knew,"" and it's acapella."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I mean, I think it's like crazily auto-tuned and layered,"
01:36:43;01:36:46;"but the arrangement is incredible."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"Everyone's performance is really good."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"It's just a great song in general,"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"and I think it's fantastic."
01:36:51;01:36:52;"- I'm gonna check it out later."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"- Yeah, Jake, are you down to listen to the whole album,"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"and then in a future episode,"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"check back in with Brian to discuss?"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:36:59;01:37:03;"- I can say with confidence that I think it's the best album"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"front to back of the boy band era."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"- So you're familiar with the full-length records"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC?"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"- Yes."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"I'm hardcore NSYNC ride or die,"
01:37:12;01:37:16;"and I needed to make sure I educated myself"
01:37:16;01:37:20;"so I could speak with knowledge about why they're superior."
01:37:20;01:37:24;"- Brian, what's your take on their follow-up, ""Celebrity,"""
01:37:24;01:37:26;"where they got a little bit more experimental?"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"- I think ""Celebrity"" has some really fantastic moments"
01:37:29;01:37:32;"on it that were not appreciated by the crowd."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"Some of the decision-making on that record was pretty crazy."
01:37:35;01:37:40;"But not as many string bangers as either of their"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"other two albums."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"- Is it fair to say that ""No Strings Attached"""
01:37:43;01:37:46;"was their ""Rumors"" and ""Celebrity"" was ""Tusk""?"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"- I would say that, but I will say that ""Celebrity"""
01:37:48;01:37:53;"is their last album, so there is more weight to it."
01:37:53;01:37:57;"- And it never got those future albums to contextualize it."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"Yeah, if ""Tusk"" was their last album,"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"people probably wouldn't have revisited it"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"with the same kind of excitement,"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"be like, ""Yo, but in between 'Rumors'"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"and then the '80s hits, there's this really cool album"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"that didn't do as well."""
01:38:08;01:38:09;"It's kind of a different story"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"when it's tucked in the middle."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:38:12;01:38:15;"But I will say, the thing that's cool about ""Celebrity"""
01:38:15;01:38:18;"is that I think they were kind of given the reins"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"a bit more to write and produce stuff."
01:38:21;01:38:24;"And that's one thing that I think really gives"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"a little more weight, in my opinion,"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"and makes it more impressive."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"- Yeah."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"- Like, JC was on some (beep) is all I have to say."
01:38:30;01:38:33;"Like, he's into, there's some Beach Boys-y"
01:38:33;01:38:36;"kind of Pet Sounds-y vibe stuff on there"
01:38:36;01:38:37;"that's pretty wild."
01:38:37;01:38:40;"- It's also when JT started beatboxing."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"- Yes."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"- That side of him."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"- The album version of the song ""Pop"""
01:38:46;01:38:49;"has like a 40-second beatbox break at the end."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"- Crazy."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"- Jake, you know what?"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"I'm gonna listen to ""No Strings Attached"" too,"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"and I think we should revisit this on a future ep"
01:38:53;01:38:57;"because boy band pop is actually a very"
01:38:57;01:39:01;"under-examined genre for this show."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- I agree."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"- I was on the Peloton the other day,"
01:39:04;01:39:05;"and I caught,"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"♪ It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you ♪"
01:39:09;01:39:10;"Is that NSYNC?"
01:39:10;01:39:10;"- Yeah."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"- I was like, (beep) this sounds tight."
01:39:12;01:39:14;"- Feels like the stars are really aligning"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"for a Jake NSYNC moment."
01:39:16;01:39:20;"Guided by Voices, Grateful Dead, NSYNC."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"- There's one track on ""No Strings Attached"""
01:39:22;01:39:26;"that kind of reminds me of the Grateful Dead thing"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"where, this is a bit of a stretch, I'm sorry,"
01:39:28;01:39:31;"but they have one song called ""Space Cowboy"""
01:39:31;01:39:32;"on ""No Strings Attached."""
01:39:32;01:39:34;"- Wait, what? - Whoa."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"- Yes, exactly, exactly."
01:39:35;01:39:38;"And this is obviously pre the Kacey Musgraves version,"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"and it's way more literal,"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"let's go to space, take a ride."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"And it kind of reminds me of one of those really trippy"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"Grateful Dead,"
01:39:47;01:39:51;"or like a Jerry Garcia solo album cut"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"or something like that that just takes you,"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"it's like, oh, everything is about one other thing,"
01:39:55;01:39:58;"but then we go to space on this track."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"And it's like, I think it's kind of a similar thing."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"- In a way."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"- From the Mars Hotel."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"- They made a whole album in some way"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"that's about a hotel on Mars."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"I don't think we're gonna talk about it in the lyrics,"
01:40:09;01:40:12;"but kind of similar."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"- Proportionalize it compared to the Grateful Dead"
01:40:14;01:40:18;"discography, the NSYNC one song might be as weightful"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"as a whole Grateful Dead album."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"- I wonder if there's a backstory to that."
01:40:21;01:40:24;"The guys all dropped acid together for the first time"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"and went to Disney World."
01:40:26;01:40:29;"- Wow."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"- And they threw on Steve Miller's greatest hits"
01:40:30;01:40:31;"on the drive down."
01:40:31;01:40:35;"- Some people call me the space cowboy."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"- Yeah, they're on Space Mountain."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"It was originally called Space Mountain,"
01:40:38;01:40:41;"but then they wanted to make it a little cooler."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"All right, Brian, well, good to hear from you."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"Let's get you back here soon,"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"'cause I feel like this is a rich vein of T-"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"- Yeah, we see NSYNC."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"- We've talked about NSYNC for hours,"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"so just let me know whenever."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"- One of the world's foremost experts."

01:40:55;01:40:57;"in these strange and uncertain times."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"- You too."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Good to hear all your voices."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"- Yeah, good to see you."
01:41:00;01:41:02;"- Yeah, you too, man."
01:41:02;01:41:02;"Have a good one."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"- Good to see you."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"- Stay safe, peace, y'all."

01:41:57;01:41:59;"I've always been meaning to go deeper on NSYNC myself."
01:41:59;01:42:03;"The last thing we'll say,"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"'cause this I don't think is worth bringing up"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"too much later before we get into the top five."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"Nancy Pelosi talked to James Corden on her show."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"We had a few TCNs tweeting this at us."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"And I saw this already and it struck me."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"He was basically asking her,"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"""What's keeping you sane during quarantine?"""
01:42:19;01:42:21;"And she basically opened her freezer"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"to say how much she loved ice cream and chocolate."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"And she had a lot of ice cream from the brand Jenny's,"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"which is a great ice cream brand."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"They have a few shops in LA."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"It's originally from Ohio,"
01:42:32;01:42:35;"but it's a great artisanal ice cream brand."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"But what was really interesting"
01:42:36;01:42:39;"was not just that she had a load of one brand of ice cream,"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"but was that in her kitchen,"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"she appeared to have two fridges."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"And at first I was like,"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"""Wait, is one the fridge and one's the freezer?"""
01:42:47;01:42:49;"But then she opened like a freezer drawer"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"and you're kind of like,"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"""No, I think it's just two distinct"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"freezer/fridge combos."""
01:42:54;01:42:57;"And of course we've talked at length on this show"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"about two fridge households,"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"but a two fridge kitchen, it's on another level."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"- Which makes me think, yeah,"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"it was designed that way from the get-go."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"- Like we're doing the renovation on Nancy Pelosi's kitchen"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"at Pacific Heights in San Francisco."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- Yep."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"- Scrap what you have."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"We need to actually make room with the floor plan"
01:43:16;01:43:20;"for two fridges, two identical massive fridges."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"- The interior decorators like,"
01:43:22;01:43:25;"""Nancy, I find this very gauche."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"Can't we get you a nice chest freezer,"
01:43:27;01:43:28;"perhaps in the garage?"""
01:43:28;01:43:29;"And she's just like,"
01:43:29;01:43:33;"""No, I want two refrigerators in the kitchen"
01:43:33;01:43:36;"and I want two chest freezers in the garage."""
01:43:36;01:43:39;"- Nancy, this is over 200 cubic feet"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"of refrigeration in your house."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"This is frankly excessive."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"- She might as well just have like on the old Batman"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"when he goes to see the penguin"
01:43:48;01:43:51;"and he would just like live in like a big,"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"like cold room."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"She could essentially just have like a whole wing"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"of the house is ice world."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"- Yeah, just a walk-in freezer."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"- You know what would be tight is if,"
01:44:00;01:44:04;"although I'm sure COVID and the recession"
01:44:04;01:44:07;"will definitely puncture some of the foodie dreams"
01:44:07;01:44:10;"of the relatively more flush years,"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"but it would be tight if somebody was like so into food,"
01:44:13;01:44:17;"but also kind of liked the different temperatures."
01:44:17;01:44:17;"'Cause you know, it is,"
01:44:17;01:44:20;"apparently it's good to go, you know,"
01:44:20;01:44:20;"have you ever done it?"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"You steam and then you jump in an ice bath."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"It's good for your heart and your skin."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"- It's crazy, yeah."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"- It would be tight."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"You could kill a few birds with one stone"
01:44:28;01:44:31;"if somebody was like built a house where you're like,"
01:44:31;01:44:35;"it's a massive walk-in refrigerator/freezer"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"where you keep everything."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"But also it's so big that it's not just like racks"
01:44:40;01:44:43;"and like hanging pigs and whatever you might find."
01:44:43;01:44:46;"There's like furniture that's like made out of ice."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"It's like Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"So it's like, you're at Nancy Pelosi's $50 million mansion"
01:44:53;01:44:56;"in Pacific Heights and you enter that room to like,"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"you know, go grab some ice cream,"
01:44:58;01:45:01;"but you gotta like put on like a huge fur coat."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"You know, Nancy Pelosi has like one of her kids"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"to get some ice cream and just like,"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"you could either bring it back into the living room"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"or everybody puts on a fur coat,"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"like the lion, the witch and the wardrobe."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"And you step into this frozen world"
01:45:13;01:45:16;"and you sit down at an ice table"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"and you eat the ice cream in there."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"And then you're like, oh, I'm cold."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"Let's go back."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Okay."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"And then you go run back to the living room by the fire."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"You know what actually be really tight is straight up."
01:45:24;01:45:27;"If you're like into the lion, the witch and the wardrobe,"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"you know, maybe you have your kitchen"
01:45:28;01:45:31;"and nearby there's some kind of like closet,"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"like where people hang their coats"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"when they enter the house."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"It'd be cool if you kind of enter the kitchen"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"and you're just like, wait, there's no fridge in here."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"And then somebody is like,"
01:45:38;01:45:39;"oh no, that's the door to the fridge."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"And they open it and it's a bunch of fur coats hanging."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"And you're like, no, oh, I guess I'm confused."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"This seems like the coat closet."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"And somebody is just like,"
01:45:47;01:45:50;"throw on the fur coat and take a few steps deeper."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"And the next thing you know,"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"you're in a winter wonderland full of ice cream"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"and frozen peas and things of that nature."
01:45:56;01:46:00;"Some people were saying that they thought,"
01:46:00;01:46:01;"I'm not saying she's a bad person,"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"but it's a little bit unfortunate"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"that one of the prominent Democrats,"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"speaker of the house is so rich."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"- Yeah."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"- And look, everybody knew she was rich"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"before she showed her two refrigerators,"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"but she's like really rich."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"- Yeah."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"- She and her husband have a very wealthy household."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"And you know, like,"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"if they were like (beep) your fridges,"
01:46:20;01:46:24;"you could just be like, wow, weird, strange."
01:46:24;01:46:25;"(laughing)"
01:46:25;01:46:29;"- If she just had like two white ice boxes."
01:46:29;01:46:29;"- Yeah."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"- She bought 'em at like 91."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"- Yeah."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Nancy Pelosi's like a weird hoarder,"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"stacks the newspapers."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"There's something about having two like baller fridges."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"That's just like,"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"- Yeah."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"- It didn't even cross your mind"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"to not show the American people that."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"- That's a red flag."
01:46:45;01:46:49;"Now it's become a non-zero possibility"
01:46:49;01:46:52;"that at some point Trump will be like,"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"people say I'm out of touch."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"I mean, listen, I got a taste for gold."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"What can I say?"
01:46:56;01:46:59;"It's my favorite color, but trust me folks."
01:46:59;01:47:02;"Anybody who has two refrigerators in their kitchen,"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"that's somebody you can't trust."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"That's a greedy person."
01:47:05;01:47:09;"- Those fridges were gigantic folks."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"They're huge."
01:47:10;01:47:14;"- Please Mr. Biden, there's no room for error, man."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"If Trump brings up the two fridges,"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"you need to have that pivot worked out"
01:47:18;01:47:21;"because he's gonna get the Democrats on this"
01:47:21;01:47:22;"and it's not gonna be pretty."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"- If anyone from the Biden campaign's listening,"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"prep your candidate for the two fridge attack."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"It's coming."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"- Now listen folks, a two fridge household,"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"of course I understand,"
01:47:34;01:47:35;"chest freezer full of McRibs."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Who hasn't done that?"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"But two in the kitchen."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"Well, hold on Donald."
01:47:40;01:47:42;"Actually I've been to Nancy's garage."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"She doesn't have a chest freezer."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"So it is in fact a two fridge household."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"It's no different than Lonnie's dad."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Oh, he's not Lonnie's dad."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"(laughing)"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"All right, let's get into the top five."
01:47:54;01:47:59;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:47:59;01:48:04;"- We were gonna do a comparison top five,"
01:48:04;01:48:08;"but with all our great guests and deep convos,"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"we're gonna go straight into the current hits of today,"
01:48:11;01:48:12;"which I think is good"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"'cause we haven't really talked about modern music"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"in a while."
01:48:15;01:48:18;"NSYNC is the most modern music we've talked about"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"in a minute."
01:48:19;01:48:24;"The number five song right now on the Apple music charts"
01:48:24;01:48:28;"is St. John Rose's Imanbek remix."
01:48:31;01:48:36;"St. John is a Brooklyn, New York rapper."
01:48:37;01:48:41;"♪ This gon' make me feel like I'm in the North ♪"
01:48:41;01:48:45;"♪ You already know, you already know ♪"
01:48:45;01:48:49;"♪ I'ma get it, gonna lose the money, I'ma kill it ♪"
01:48:49;01:48:53;"♪ She might get it, but I'ma know my way before you do ♪"
01:48:53;01:48:57;"♪ I already know, I already know ♪"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"- Well, this song has a real journey."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"- Yeah, it's like we're still in the intro."
01:49:01;01:49:06;"- The song came out in 2016, then again in 2018."
01:49:07;01:49:07;"And then, all right,"
01:49:07;01:49:12;"then this remix was released in September 13, 2019."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"Okay, I think I've heard enough."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Well, I was kind of waiting for like the voice"
01:49:16;01:49:20;"to drop down and that kind of sounded like a DJ,"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"I guess 'cause it's a remix,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"maybe I can't tell if it's pitched up"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"or somebody just has a really high voice."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"I'm interested that this is up in the charts"
01:49:26;01:49:31;"because this really reminds me of something"
01:49:31;01:49:36;"that I would have heard blasting off the Radio 1"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"in a Sprinter van in the UK"
01:49:39;01:49:43;"when Vampire Weekend first started touring there in 2008."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"It really like takes me back."
01:49:44;01:49:48;"Just picture me wearing a little preppy gray coat"
01:49:48;01:49:51;"and a plaid scarf freezing."
01:49:51;01:49:56;"Deep winter in the UK, early Vampire Weekend days"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"and just like listening to UK radio"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"and just like hearing a song like that,"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"you're like, ""This is cool."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"""I guess I wouldn't hear this in the US."""
01:50:04;01:50:08;"But since 2008, the UK has really,"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"I think been very influential actually."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Not that this is a UK song,"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"it's a Brooklyn dude and a Russian dude,"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"but it's got that kind of like energy."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"It's the shit you used to hear and be like,"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"""Oh, that sounds like it hit in the UK."""
01:50:19;01:50:20;"And then at some point,"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"the songs that sounded like hits in the UK"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"started being hits in the US."
01:50:24;01:50:27;"- The song apparently took off on TikTok."
01:50:27;01:50:29;"- Ah, there you go."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"That's kind of always the answer."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Anytime you're kind of like, ""What's the story with this?"""
01:50:33;01:50:35;"It's TikTok."
01:50:35;01:50:38;"The number four song right now is Tory Lanez, ""Stupid Again."""
01:50:38;01:50:40;"- I just wanna say from the bottom of my heart,"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"I'd like to take this-"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"- Jake, do you know who Tory Lanez is?"
01:50:43;01:50:43;"- No."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- To absolutely nobody."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"(crowd cheering)"
01:50:46;01:50:50;"- So it starts with a sample of Conor McGregor,"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"the UFC fighter."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"- Oh, is that what that was?"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Yeah, him just talking."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"♪ I'm a fool or a freak ♪"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"♪ Just made a flip out the rock ♪"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"♪ And Frank Mueller, I jump out the jewel again ♪"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"- So Tory Lanez has been hosting quarantine radio"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"via Instagram Live,"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"and he got banned last week due to nudity."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Although he claims he didn't have any nudity"
01:51:10;01:51:11;"on his Instagram Live show."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"Only a girl sucking on a gummy bear."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"- Damn."
01:51:15;01:51:19;"- But then he claims that he played Instagram,"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"his new project,"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"and they loved it so much that they're lifting the band."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"(snorts)"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"- Tory Lanez sounds like a guy"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"that was in the band like Poison."
01:51:29;01:51:32;"- Yeah, totally."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"You know what I mean?"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Tory Lanez, rhythm guitar and Poison."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"- He's Canadian."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"- Is he from Toronto?"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"- He's actually from Brampton,"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"which is like a suburb of Toronto."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- What's Brampton like?"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"You've been out there a sign for?"
01:51:44;01:51:45;"- Yeah, I've been out there a couple times."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"It's like a typical-- - It's like a suburb?"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"- Suburb, yeah."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Yeah, it's on the outskirts."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"- Brampton is such a classic Canadian town name."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"What is it about Brampton that sounds so Canadian?"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"- Yeah, I don't know."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"It's like that slight,"
01:51:57;01:52:01;"almost Scottish-Irish vibe to it or something."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"- Right."
01:52:02;01:52:06;"- You can sort of hear it in that extreme Canadian accent"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"or something."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"- Brampton."
01:52:08;01:52:12;"Yeah, no, but Tory Lanez is definitely like a metal man."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Motley Crue movie."
01:52:13;01:52:17;"- Nicky Sixx and his good buddy Tory Lanez."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"- So listen, Nicky and Tory Lanez,"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"they felt like getting some fresh air."
01:52:21;01:52:25;"Only one thing, they wanted to do it in a Maserati."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"(laughing)"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"And let's say Tory didn't like going slow."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"- Wait, did we ever talk about that Motley Crue movie?"
01:52:33;01:52:34;"The Dirt?"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"- We must've referenced it on the show."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"- You watched it, right?"
01:52:38;01:52:39;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"- We definitely did."
01:52:40;01:52:41;"- Okay."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"- Great film, worth watching."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"The next song is Roddy Ricch to the Box."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"I don't know if we can say anything else"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"about Roddy Ricch to the Box."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"- It's finally at a number one."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"- It's at a number one."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"- Should we just move on?"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"- Yeah, okay."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"Number two, The Weekend, ""Blinding Lights."""
01:52:56;01:52:59;"This is the one that I think was inspired by ""Aha."""
01:52:59;01:53:00;"- Oh, this is, okay."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"- Yeah, I like the song now."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"- I'm kind of shocked."
01:53:04;01:53:08;"We haven't done the top five in like at least a month."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"And like, it's weird how long things stick around."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"- Maybe COVID froze culture a little bit."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"- Oh yeah."
01:53:15;01:53:19;"- The number, God, there's so many Canadians in the top five."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"Simons, how do you feel about this?"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"- I don't know why you gotta say it with such disdain."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Like you got this like--"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- Specifically Toronto based."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- Who is it?"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"What is it, Bieber?"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"- This is Drake, ""Tootsie Slide."""
01:53:31;01:53:33;"- Oh, I like this one."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"This was like made for TikTok."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"- Jake, have you heard the song or seen the video?"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"- No, I've not heard it or seen it."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"- It's like a classic Drake song,"
01:53:42;01:53:46;"but the chorus gives you the moves to a very simple dance."
01:53:46;01:53:50;"♪ Nike crossbody, got a piece in it ♪"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"♪ Gotta dance, but it's really on some street ♪"

01:54:19;01:54:22;"- I saw people being like, this is Drake's,"
01:54:22;01:54:25;"the haters were being like, this is a flop."
01:54:25;01:54:29;"This is Drake's craven attempt at just trying"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"to create a TikTok moment, which should happen naturally."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"A true TikTok moment is an old song"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"that gets remixed by a Russian DJ"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"and then takes off years later."
01:54:38;01:54:43;"Not a billionaire rapper just pulling it out of thin air."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"But I guess to Drake's credit,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"it wouldn't be Drake if he just said like,"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"hey, what's up everybody, it's Drake."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"He has to have at least some plan words."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"So he's saying, black leather gloves, no sequins,"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"buckles on the jacket, it's a leek's (beep)"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Nike crossbody, got a piece in it,"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"got to dance but it's really on some street (beep)"
01:55:00;01:55:01;"I'm gonna show you how to get it."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"So he's, okay, he's talking about some,"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"his clothing and he's got a gun and he's got to dance."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"It goes right foot up, left foot slide,"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"left foot up, right foot slide."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"Basically I'm saying either way we 'bout to slide,"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"hey, can't let this one slide."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"I really want it to come together."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"I don't know if it does, but I see what he's trying to do."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"- What does he mean, we're gonna slide?"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"- I don't know. - I think he means"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"we're gonna leave the club together."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"- Okay. - Yeah."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"- And go home and have a sexual intercourse."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"- Can't let this one slide."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"I can't let the sexual tension slide."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"- I think it's like, I can't let you out of my sight."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"I can't let go of you."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"- And then he makes it more clear in the second verse."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Don't you wanna dance with me?"
01:55:37;01:55:40;"No, I could dance like Michael Jackson."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"I could give you thug passion."
01:55:41;01:55:44;"It's a thriller in the trap where we were from."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"If you don't know, Thriller's a Michael Jackson album,"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"so it's kind of a plan words."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"Baby, don't you wanna dance with me?"
01:55:48;01:55:51;"No, I could dance like Michael Jackson."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"I could give you satisfaction."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"And you know we out here every day with it."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"I'm gonna show you how to get it."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"Okay, now I understand."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"I think you're right, Seinfeld."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"He's at the club."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"He's got his gloves and his gun."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"- It's a gun."
01:56:02;01:56:06;"Are you an assassin?"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Is there a reference to that?"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"- Yeah, he says Nike cross body got a piece in it."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"Wait, what does the cross body refer to?"
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Oh, it's a bag."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"- It's like a fanny pack. - It's a fanny pack."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"- But it's a fanny pack that you wear"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"like kind of across your body."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"- Yeah."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"I'm picturing Drake talking to a girl in the club"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"and he's like, ""Yo, check out my gloves."
01:56:29;01:56:29;"""What's up, I'm Drake."""
01:56:29;01:56:31;"And she's like, ""Oh, haha, I know who you are."""
01:56:31;01:56:33;"And he's like, ""Check out my gloves."""
01:56:33;01:56:34;"And she's like, ""They're really nice."""
01:56:34;01:56:36;"And then he whispers in his ear,"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"""I have a gun in my fanny pack."""
01:56:38;01:56:39;"(laughing)"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"And she's like, ""What the (beep) did you just say to me?"""
01:56:41;01:56:45;"And he's like, ""I have a gun in my fanny pack."""
01:56:45;01:56:47;"And she's like, ""Oh, uh."""
01:56:47;01:56:47;"And she starts talking, and he's like,"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"""No, no, I'm sorry, I wasn't threatening you."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"""I was just trying to show off."
01:56:51;01:56:55;"""Anyway, I made up a dance."""
01:56:55;01:56:58;"And she's like, ""Really?"""
01:56:58;01:57:01;"And then he has to make it up on the spot."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"How does it go?"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"So basically this whole song is Drake accidentally scared"
01:57:05;01:57:06;"somebody he was hitting on by telling her"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"he had a gun in his fanny pack."
01:57:08;01:57:10;"And then he had to make up a dance on the spot"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"to not seem like a weirdo."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"- That's why the dance is so simple."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"- Yeah."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"- He's like, ""Oh."" - Right, if Drake had a full day"
01:57:15;01:57:18;"to come up with a dance, it'd be all sorts of crazy."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"You couldn't even explain it in a song."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"That's why it's so simple."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"I'm a little disappointed 'cause when I first heard it,"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"for whatever reason, maybe because like,"
01:57:25;01:57:28;"Van Far Weekend always does one of our go-to covers"
01:57:28;01:57:31;"is Bruce Springsteen, ""I'm Going Down."""
01:57:31;01:57:32;"Him saying, basically I'm saying,"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"""Either way, we about to slide."""
01:57:34;01:57:36;"People don't even say slide this way,"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"but for some reason I thought like,"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"it would make sense, like a Drake sad dance,"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"where he's like, ""This is my song, 'The Toosie Slide,'"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"""but you know what, it doesn't even matter,"
01:57:45;01:57:48;"""'cause either way, we're about to slide into a recession."""
01:57:48;01:57:49;"(humming)"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"Like, ""I'm going down,"" just like,"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"""I'm about to slide into a depression."""
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Or he just meant like, ""I'm going down,"""
01:57:55;01:57:57;"and then he's like, ""Can't let this one slide."""
01:57:57;01:57:59;"Also, there's something about telling somebody a dance"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"but going, ""Hey, go right foot up, left foot slide,"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"""left foot up, right foot slide."""
01:58:04;01:58:06;"Basically I'm saying, ""Either way, we about to slide."""
01:58:06;01:58:08;"Hey, can't let this one slide."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"It's almost like it's a depressive dance."
01:58:10;01:58:14;"- It's almost like, yeah, either way, we're about to die."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"The death comes first. - Basically I'm saying,"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"""Either way, we about to die."""
01:58:18;01:58:19;"You can't let that one slide."
01:58:19;01:58:21;"(laughing)"
01:58:21;01:58:22;"I remember the night that this came out,"
01:58:22;01:58:25;"I watched the video, and it's an interesting video."
01:58:25;01:58:26;"Jake, you should watch it."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"It's a little bit Nancy Pelosi-esque"
01:58:28;01:58:31;"because it's a very important, famous person"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"making the decision to show the world their home."
01:58:34;01:58:35;"- Oh, wow. - Which, you know,"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"in COVID times, obviously,"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"you're gonna be having a lot of that,"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"but for, you know, better for worse,"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"you're kinda demystifying (beep)"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"when you see how people live, although,"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"and right after Drake made the video,"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"'cause the whole, it's like one or two shots"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"where basically you're walking through his house,"
01:58:51;01:58:54;"which is in some very fancy suburb of Toronto."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Apparently the house has cost like 50"
01:58:56;01:58:57;"or 100 million dollars or something,"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"and the week the video came out"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"where he walks you through his crazy house,"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"and then it ends with him in the backyard"
01:59:03;01:59:05;"and fireworks go off, which I'm so curious about,"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"like what the neighbors thought about that,"
01:59:07;01:59:11;"but a big Architectural Digest article came out"
01:59:11;01:59:13;"about Drake's new house,"
01:59:13;01:59:14;"and you get to talk to the interior decorator"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"and all that (beep)."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"- Actually, somebody wanna send Jake the article?"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"I just wanna hear Jake's take when he sees the pictures."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"- It's cool he still lives in Toronto."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"- I think it's one of many abodes,"
01:59:25;01:59:30;"but I imagine this is his most extravagant property."
01:59:30;01:59:32;"It's 50,000 square feet with amenities"
01:59:32;01:59:36;"such as an NBA regulation size indoor basketball court,"
01:59:36;01:59:39;"crowned by a 21 square foot pyramidal skylight."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"- Oh, wow."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"- It's clearly a house made for entertaining."
01:59:42;01:59:44;"- It's so brutal."
01:59:44;01:59:45;"- Brutalist?"
01:59:45;01:59:48;"- It's brutalist, it's brutal, it's not tasteful."
01:59:48;01:59:50;"- It's a little Trump, but."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"- Yeah, it's just,"
01:59:52;01:59:55;"well, gaudy as all hell."
01:59:55;01:59:56;"I mean, it's just."
01:59:56;01:59:57;"- It looks expensive."
01:59:57;02:00:01;"- It wouldn't be like a comfortable place to like hang out."
02:00:01;02:00:03;"It's very cold."
02:00:03;02:00:06;"Ugh, come on, man."
02:00:06;02:00:08;"- It looks like a hotel, right?"
02:00:08;02:00:09;"- A bar. - A new hotel."
02:00:09;02:00:12;"- Or like a high-end condo or something."
02:00:12;02:00:14;"- I'm not mad at it, like to be totally honest,"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"like some of it, it's neither tasteful"
02:00:16;02:00:19;"in like the traditional classical way,"
02:00:19;02:00:22;"nor is it tasteful in like the slick modern way."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"But some of it is like some of these rooms,"
02:00:24;02:00:27;"if like you were hanging out with like some like playboy,"
02:00:27;02:00:32;"Italian guy whose family owned a giant car company"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"in like the '70s, and you walked into that room,"
02:00:34;02:00:36;"you'd be kind of like, this is sick."
02:00:36;02:00:38;"Like the weird browns and oranges"
02:00:38;02:00:41;"and crazy high ceilings."
02:00:41;02:00:43;"- I like this quote where they talk,"
02:00:43;02:00:44;"Drake's favorite spot in the house,"
02:00:44;02:00:47;"this is 3,200 square foot master bedroom suite."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"- Hell yeah."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"- This house actually could have the line"
02:00:50;02:00:53;"which in the wardrobe frozen world."
02:00:53;02:00:55;"His master bedroom suite, 3,200 square feet,"
02:00:55;02:00:59;"that's far bigger than most people's houses"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"with an additional 1,100 square feet of covered terraces."
02:01:01;02:01:06;"So that's a 4,300 square foot bedroom area."
02:01:06;02:01:08;"And Drake says, ""The bedroom is where I come"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"""to decompress from the world at the end of the night"
02:01:10;02:01:12;"""and where I open my eyes to seize the day."""
02:01:12;02:01:14;"- He basically just said,"
02:01:14;02:01:17;"""The bedroom is where I go to bed and where I wake up."""
02:01:17;02:01:20;"(laughing)"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"- But Drake is kind of a genius."
02:01:22;02:01:24;"Like you wonder if when he says something like that,"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"it is a mix of like bravado,"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"but also he kind of knows it's funny."
02:01:28;02:01:30;"- Chaining Tatum."
02:01:30;02:01:33;"- Chaining Tatum, yeah, it's a Chaining Tatum type line."
02:01:33;02:01:36;"But also I wonder if he like just wrote these lines out"
02:01:36;02:01:39;"in like an email and they forwarded it to the journalist,"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"or if they said like, or he was showing them around"
02:01:41;02:01:43;"and just like holding a tape recorder and they're just like,"
02:01:43;02:01:45;"""So why did you spend so much time"
02:01:45;02:01:47;"""to get the bedroom suite right"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"""and dedicate so much space to it?"""
02:01:48;02:01:49;"And he was just like there thinking,"
02:01:49;02:01:52;"and he's like, ""Well, the bedroom's where I come"
02:01:52;02:01:55;"""to decompress from the world at the end of the night"
02:01:55;02:01:57;"""and where I open my eyes to seize the day."""
02:01:57;02:01:59;"Like, did that just come out of his mouth?"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"Either way, he's a genius."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"Either way, I'm not mad at it."
02:02:03;02:02:05;"There is a paradox to luxury."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"I've always thought this."
02:02:06;02:02:09;"I remember watching a documentary about David Geffen"
02:02:09;02:02:14;"and David Geffen is a very iconic media figure."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"He worked with all sorts of incredible artists"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"and he helped make a lot of them stars."
02:02:18;02:02:21;"Eagles, Joni Mitchell, you name it."
02:02:21;02:02:22;"But when you watch this documentary,"
02:02:22;02:02:25;"you basically say like, okay, he was this really smart guy,"
02:02:25;02:02:28;"but he also burnt a lot of bridges."
02:02:28;02:02:29;"For everybody who says, ""Thank you,"
02:02:29;02:02:32;"""you helped make my career, I owe you everything,"""
02:02:32;02:02:33;"there was somebody else who was like,"
02:02:33;02:02:34;"""Man, (beep) that guy."""
02:02:36;02:02:39;"Business people, they're gonna make a lot of friends"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"and even more enemies."
02:02:41;02:02:42;"So basically, you watch this thing"
02:02:42;02:02:45;"and it kind of ends with him sitting at this huge,"
02:02:45;02:02:47;"like Beverly Hills estate that he bought,"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"which used to belong to one of the original"
02:02:50;02:02:54;"Hollywood magnates, like a Warner brother"
02:02:54;02:02:55;"or something like that."
02:02:55;02:02:56;"I forget who exactly."
02:02:56;02:02:59;"And for him, this ambitious guy who kind of came from nowhere"
02:02:59;02:03:04;"and became a media magnate to own this insane spread"
02:03:05;02:03:09;"that was built by one of the godfathers of Hollywood"
02:03:09;02:03:11;"was like a real achievement."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"But then I remember, and I wonder if they did it on purpose,"
02:03:13;02:03:16;"then the camera pans away and he's,"
02:03:16;02:03:17;"I think at that point in his life,"
02:03:17;02:03:21;"he was single, living by himself in this giant house"
02:03:21;02:03:22;"and it kind of pans away."
02:03:22;02:03:25;"And you see him just like sitting in a chair"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"on this massive estate and the camera pans away"
02:03:27;02:03:28;"and he just like looks so small,"
02:03:28;02:03:31;"just engulfed by this huge expanse."
02:03:31;02:03:33;"And then you start thinking like,"
02:03:33;02:03:36;"man, this is a guy who like alienated a lot of people."
02:03:36;02:03:38;"And he's, you know, I'm sure he's got friends"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"and he probably throws like sick parties sometimes,"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"but it's like kind of like a weird Gatsby type image"
02:03:42;02:03:46;"of like the dude surrounded by so much luxury."
02:03:46;02:03:50;"And that is the ultimate paradox of wealth and luxury."
02:03:50;02:03:53;"You're rich enough and popular enough"
02:03:53;02:03:56;"that you could have a regulation basketball court"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"inside your house in an urban area."
02:03:59;02:04:01;"You can afford to build it, you can make it sick."
02:04:01;02:04:02;"And you probably know enough people"
02:04:02;02:04:05;"that every now and then you probably got NBA dudes"
02:04:05;02:04:06;"shooting around."
02:04:06;02:04:10;"But to have that means that 99% of the time"
02:04:10;02:04:14;"you have an NBA regulation size basketball court"
02:04:14;02:04:15;"sitting empty."
02:04:15;02:04:19;"- Collecting dust, yeah."
02:04:19;02:04:20;"- Right."
02:04:20;02:04:22;"I'm sure a lot of people listening now who are quarantined"
02:04:22;02:04:25;"are like wishing they had a little more space at home."
02:04:25;02:04:30;"Obviously living on top of each other can drive people crazy"
02:04:32;02:04:34;"but it is so extreme."
02:04:34;02:04:36;"Just, yeah, you think about now during quarantine,"
02:04:36;02:04:39;"just like this full empty basketball court."
02:04:39;02:04:42;"- Like it's so extreme."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"It's like getting around by yourself."
02:04:43;02:04:45;"- Shooting around by yourself in there."
02:04:45;02:04:46;"- Yeah, you have by yourself."
02:04:46;02:04:48;"- Yeah, having the bowling alley."
02:04:48;02:04:49;"I do think that video is kind of fascinating."
02:04:49;02:04:51;"It's worth watching the Tuesday slide"
02:04:51;02:04:54;"and hats off to Drake, another hit."
02:04:54;02:04:56;"You proved the haters wrong."
02:04:56;02:04:58;"- I feel like this entire run of ""Time Crisis"""
02:04:58;02:05:01;"the last like bunch of years,"
02:05:01;02:05:03;"he's always in the mix."
02:05:03;02:05:05;"- And he's always dropping that song"
02:05:05;02:05:09;"that somebody's like the streak's over and it never is."
02:05:09;02:05:12;"I just hope that he has good friends"
02:05:12;02:05:16;"and one day a life partner that he can shoot around with"
02:05:16;02:05:18;"because I don't like picturing him alone"
02:05:18;02:05:20;"in his giant basketball court."
02:05:20;02:05:22;"That depresses me."
02:05:22;02:05:23;"- Yeah, that's rough."
02:05:23;02:05:24;"- That's a wrap on TC."
02:05:24;02:05:25;"Thanks everybody."
02:05:25;02:05:27;"We'll see you guys in a week."
02:05:27;02:05:31;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra Koenig."
