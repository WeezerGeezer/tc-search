00:00;00:04;"Through the steam of the sauna, a familiar voice greets me."
00:04;00:09;"I rise and look at the man who just spoke to me."
00:09;00:13;"On this episode, we talk montañas,"
00:13;00:15;"flaming hot Cheetos,"
00:15;00:18;"screaming hot garden veggie straws,"
00:18;00:23;"all of this, plus the top five hits of 1990 and today."
00:23;00:24;"Leave the door open."
00:24;00:26;"You're gonna want to see what's going on inside on"
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:20;01:22;"Time Crisis back again."
01:22;01:23;"Jake, how are you?"
01:23;01:26;"Doing well. Doing well."
01:26;01:28;"Just wrapped up a long day of work."
01:28;01:29;"Yeah."
01:29;01:30;"In the same room."
01:30;01:32;"Yeah, exactly."
01:32;01:36;"I just moved over 10 feet and plugged in my computer."
01:36;01:37;"How are you?"
01:37;01:38;"I'm not bad."
01:38;01:40;"I got a cold glass of wine today."
01:40;01:41;"Nice."
01:41;01:42;"Orange wine?"
01:42;01:45;"I believe this is orange wine."
01:45;01:47;"It was just whatever was in the fridge."
01:47;01:50;"But I think, as I said on the last episode,"
01:50;01:53;"I was pretty sure I drank my last beer in the fridge."
01:53;01:55;"And you haven't restocked?"
01:55;01:56;"Have not restocked."
01:56;01:58;"It's been two weeks."
01:58;02:02;"You know, it's like, with beer, I like it."
02:02;02:03;"I'm not gonna buy."
02:03;02:05;"If you're holding, I'll have some."
02:05;02:08;"Get some leftover at the house, you know, after a party."
02:08;02:12;"That's cool, but I've just never been in that buying zone."
02:12;02:14;"Not a grocery item."
02:14;02:16;"How often would you have zero beers in your fridge?"
02:16;02:19;"It happens."
02:19;02:20;"I mean, it'll happen frequently."
02:20;02:22;"And then, you know, a few days I'll go by and I'll be like,"
02:22;02:24;"""Oh, I should pick up some brew."""
02:24;02:26;"I'll be in the mood for one and I'll--"
02:26;02:28;"There's like a corner store like a block from my house."
02:28;02:29;"Okay, right, so you're never far."
02:29;02:32;"So if we have no brew in the fridge and I'm in the mood,"
02:32;02:34;"I'll walk down and get one."
02:34;02:36;"It looks like you're sitting on a little something over there."
02:36;02:37;"Pretty simple."
02:37;02:38;"A little tequila."
02:38;02:40;"You know, it's the evening."
02:40;02:41;"We tape at 6 p.m."
02:41;02:42;"It's at the end of the day."
02:42;02:44;"Speaking of alcohol talk."
02:44;02:45;"Yeah."
02:45;02:49;"That's the alternate universe of time crisis is it's cars,"
02:49;02:51;"trees, and alcohol."
02:51;02:52;"We hit it occasionally."
02:52;02:55;"That's the yin-yang version of time crisis where that's most of it"
02:55;02:59;"and then occasionally corporate food and occasionally classic rock."
02:59;03:03;"But I went with the family to a little get-together somewhere."
03:03;03:06;"These were more like, you know, Rashida's friends, nice people,"
03:06;03:10;"but, you know, not people I knew super well,"
03:10;03:13;"but they were making margaritas and asked me if I wanted one."
03:13;03:16;"And probably the first time I had a margarita in a minute."
03:16;03:18;"I wasn't slamming too many during COVID."
03:18;03:19;"Sure."
03:19;03:21;"And as soon as it hit my lips--"
03:21;03:22;"And it was an excellent margarita."
03:22;03:24;"The host worked really hard, clearly had a knack for it."
03:24;03:26;"Only one thing could come to mind."
03:26;03:28;"I really had to like stop myself."
03:28;03:32;"I was having intrusive thoughts about the worst margarita of my life."
03:32;03:35;"Like truly I was like sip it and I'd like start humming it a little bit."
03:35;03:38;"And I was just like, I don't want to have to like explain that."
03:38;03:39;"I don't want to give off bad energy."
03:39;03:41;"This guy worked really hard to make a great margarita."
03:41;03:42;"And here I am."
03:42;03:44;"What's that song you're singing?"
03:44;03:46;"I've had a few moments like that in life where, you know,"
03:46;03:48;"something pops into your head."
03:48;03:51;"The classic example, you might have versions of this."
03:51;03:54;"Maybe everybody does like run into a musician."
03:54;03:57;"You're near them and you look at them and you think,"
03:57;03:59;"""Oh, who's that person? What band are they in?"""
03:59;04:01;"And then just like you start thinking of one of their songs."
04:01;04:03;"And like this would be some like, to me,"
04:03;04:07;"I picture being like catering at a festival in 2008."
04:07;04:10;"And just like seeing somebody just like starting to like hum it to myself."
04:10;04:13;"Oh my God, I don't even know this person."
04:13;04:15;"I actually remember one notable time."
04:15;04:18;"I think I was behind a member of the Ting Tings."
04:18;04:20;"They did some huge songs at the time."
04:20;04:22;"So they were like ubiquitous."
04:22;04:25;"One of them was like, ""That's not my name. That's not my..."""
04:25;04:27;"And I just remember like, I think I literally,"
04:27;04:29;"something like that happened where I was like, ""Oh God, I hope I..."""
04:29;04:31;"Like I walked past somebody."
04:31;04:32;"I'm always like humming to myself and stuff."
04:32;04:35;"And I was like, ""Oh man, what do they think I was like doing?"""
04:35;04:38;"Trying to do some kind of prank or something."
04:38;04:40;"Hopefully they didn't hear."
04:40;04:42;"But anyway, I was sipping a great margarita,"
04:42;04:45;"but my brain is now wired when I think about margaritas"
04:45;04:48;"to exclusively think about the worst margarita in my life."
04:48;04:50;"And I was like, ""What's that song you're singing?"""
04:50;04:52;"And you're like, ""It's a song called 'The Best Margarita of My Life.'"""
04:52;04:53;"Right."
04:53;04:57;"A friend of mine went to a Dodger game a few weeks ago"
04:57;05:01;"and sent me a photograph of them standing in front of the margarita stand"
05:01;05:03;"at Dodger Stadium."
05:03;05:05;"And I was like, ""Did the song teach you nothing?"""
05:05;05:11;"You know, I feel like we should probably get some Dodgers fans on one of these days."
05:11;05:16;"Because I know at least once I was talking to some like old school LA person."
05:16;05:18;"And who could this have been?"
05:18;05:19;"I don't know."
05:19;05:23;"I know at least once I had a conversation about Dodger Stadium and I said,"
05:23;05:26;"""Oh, have you heard this Mountain Brews song? It's a great song."""
05:26;05:28;"And at least once somebody said to me,"
05:28;05:30;"""Okay, but that doesn't make any sense."
05:30;05:33;"The margaritas are excellent at Dodger Stadium."""
05:33;05:35;"Wow."
05:35;05:38;"Well, maybe that person is like VIP and they're in that weird like--"
05:38;05:40;"That was exactly my thought."
05:40;05:41;"That was exactly-- Yeah."
05:41;05:44;"Because there is, for listeners, there is like--"
05:44;05:50;"I went once, someone I knew had tickets that were like these close in box seats basically."
05:50;05:54;"And included with the ticket is access to a sort of like--"
05:54;05:56;"The players club."
05:56;05:59;"Yeah, like a buffet basically of like really nice food."
05:59;06:02;"Probably everything you could think of, sushi, crab legs."
06:02;06:05;"Yeah, enchiladas, whatever."
06:05;06:08;"And I bet they got a good Marg down there."
06:08;06:09;"Oh, I bet."
06:09;06:12;"But just like mezzanine level, like dude, come on."
06:12;06:15;"It's literally flat Mountain Brew."
06:15;06:17;"Mixed with tequila for a noxious brew."
06:17;06:19;"No, maybe this is something."
06:19;06:22;"There actually could be a sequel called The Best Margarita of My Life."
06:22;06:29;"And it's about, you know, like a prominent Angeleno businessman invites you to the game."
06:29;06:31;"How about this? He's an art collector."
06:31;06:33;"He's a billionaire art collector."
06:33;06:35;"And he's just like-- This is how I roll."
06:35;06:38;"""I love your work and it'd be my honor to take you to the game."""
06:38;06:41;"And then you go to the game and he's like,"
06:41;06:42;"""Let's go get some margaritas."""
06:42;06:43;"And you're like, record scratch."
06:43;06:45;"And you're just like, ""Not a fan."""
06:45;06:48;"He's like, ""Oh, you're talking about that dog s*** there? No, no."
06:48;06:50;"We're going to the players club."""
06:50;06:51;"You guys roll in."
06:51;06:52;"You take a sip."
06:52;06:54;"And you're like, ""This is the best margarita of my life."""
06:54;06:59;"But then maybe like verse three is like, ""You really have to sit with that."""
06:59;07:01;"Man, what a country."
07:01;07:04;"I've had the best margarita of my life and the worst margarita of my life"
07:04;07:06;"in the same baseball stadium."
07:06;07:07;"What does that say about us?"
07:07;07:10;"It's all about, you know, access and who you know, man."
07:10;07:11;"That's right."
07:11;07:15;"It's really a perfect metaphor for America, dude, right?"
07:15;07:16;"That's right."
07:16;07:21;"Which is, you know, not to jump the gun, is a great segue towards"
07:21;07:28;"some pretty earth-shadowing, earth-shattering news within the TC world."
07:28;07:33;"Now, I got a little heads up that somebody told me,"
07:33;07:37;"somebody who had some connection to the journalist or something,"
07:37;07:42;"told me the day before there's going to be some piece dropping tomorrow"
07:42;07:46;"that's going to be very interesting to the TC community."
07:46;07:48;"And I was like, ""I wonder what that could be."""
07:48;07:52;"And it was a piece that probably a lot of people have at least heard about"
07:52;07:57;"if you're remotely a TC head that basically makes the explosive claim"
07:57;08:01;"that Richard Montanez, who we've been talking about for years here,"
08:01;08:04;"as the inventor of Flaming Hot Cheetos,"
08:04;08:07;"pretty amazing rags to riches story."
08:07;08:09;"A Frito-Lay employee who started as a janitor,"
08:09;08:11;"worked his way up to an executive."
08:11;08:15;"A Mexican-American man, didn't finish high school,"
08:15;08:17;"believed in himself, worked hard."
08:17;08:20;"He still kind of is a motivational speaker."
08:20;08:24;"He posts motivational quotes and videos on Instagram."
08:24;08:26;"Kind of a beloved dude."
08:26;08:31;"And this article says that he didn't actually invent Flaming Hot Cheetos."
08:31;08:35;"And there's been a lot of back and forth in the past week."
08:35;08:37;"I mean, first of all, so Nick,"
08:37;08:39;"you were starting to say to us before the show"
08:39;08:43;"that you received six telephone calls about this?"
08:43;08:48;"Yeah. I mean, I'm surprised that you guys didn't."
08:48;08:50;"Calls or texts? I got texts."
08:50;08:53;"Texts, calls. No, I got a couple of phone calls."
08:53;08:56;"Just, you know, I think people wanting to check it."
08:56;08:58;"Maybe it was from closer friends."
08:58;09:01;"But people, you know, just the idea that at some point"
09:01;09:07;"the show has become so associated with, I think, this story."
09:07;09:11;"But also just the food, corporate food stuff,"
09:11;09:15;"that I feel like people really, when they read this,"
09:15;09:18;"their first thought was, ""I want to tell you about it"
09:18;09:20;"because I think you need to cover it."""
09:20;09:23;"And that, you know, yeah, some people called and were like,"
09:23;09:25;"""Whoa, it's pretty heavy."""
09:25;09:30;"You know, it just is strange to me"
09:30;09:33;"that that is how they think of us."
09:33;09:35;"I like it."
09:35;09:37;"And I just feel like, you know, there's certain stories"
09:37;09:39;"where you start getting lots of texts or calls"
09:39;09:41;"and you're like, ""Dude, you're like the 10th person"
09:41;09:42;"to tell me about this."""
09:42;09:44;"But it's only been this story."
09:44;09:47;"And one of those people, and I'll throw back to you,"
09:47;09:50;"was friend of the show, Jonah Weiner,"
09:50;09:52;"who immediately was like, ""You got to see this"
09:52;09:54;"because my friend wrote this article."""
09:54;09:56;"He is the one who's debunked."
09:56;09:59;"Yeah, and so he's the one who introduced us."
09:59;10:02;"And we were talking about having the journalist on the show."
10:02;10:04;"He's clearly a very talented journalist."
10:04;10:05;"I just had this feeling where I was like,"
10:05;10:07;"""You know what? We got so much to talk about."
10:07;10:09;"We got to wait until we can get Montaigne's on"
10:09;10:11;"to have equal time."""
10:11;10:13;"Although, I will say, we've been trying to get him"
10:13;10:15;"on the show for a while and he's refused."
10:15;10:16;"But no hard feelings."
10:16;10:19;"But maybe now, maybe that'll be some of our"
10:19;10:21;"banked episodes for the summer."
10:21;10:25;"It's just a five-part Flamin' Hot series."
10:25;10:27;"I already said that for the documentary"
10:27;10:28;"we're going to make about it,"
10:28;10:30;"it's going to be called Flamin' Hot Mess."
10:30;10:32;"We're going to give equal time to all sides."
10:32;10:37;"♪ Sometimes I feel like I just want to go back to my old ways ♪"
10:37;10:41;"♪ You're telling me I'm silly, it's no fun in the old days ♪"

11:21;11:23;"Also, just to clarify, it's interesting to work backwards"
11:23;11:26;"because I'm pretty sure that, Jake, you're the first person"
11:26;11:28;"who mentioned this story to me."
11:28;11:29;"Maybe on the show."
11:29;11:30;"I was trying to remember."
11:30;11:33;"I feel like it might have just come up spontaneously on the show."
11:33;11:34;"But you knew it."
11:34;11:35;"Did I know it?"
11:35;11:38;"I was wondering if it was like the kind of classic TC"
11:38;11:40;"where we're kind of Googling on air."
11:40;11:42;"And we're like, ""Oh, dude, look at this."""
11:42;11:45;"My memory is that we're talking about Flamin' Hot Cheetos or something"
11:45;11:47;"and you're like, ""You know what's tight?"
11:47;11:49;"Actually, a janitor invented that."""
11:49;11:50;"You knew that somehow."
11:50;11:52;"Okay, yeah, I didn't remember."
11:52;11:54;"We got to find out how you knew that"
11:54;11:57;"because this might actually be the key to cracking the case"
11:57;11:58;"because I was reading the article."
11:58;12:00;"There's a lot of talk about, ""Well, hold on."
12:00;12:03;"Montaigne's didn't do this until '93."
12:03;12:05;"It was already in development by '89."""
12:05;12:08;"Maybe, Jake, you have some deep memory where you're like,"
12:08;12:11;"""You know what, dude? '88, that's when I found out."""
12:11;12:16;"I've been a Montaigne's head for 30 years."
12:16;12:20;"I was 11 years old on a family trip to SoCal."
12:20;12:26;"I'm on the TCU Wiki and episode 28, October 9, 2016."
12:26;12:27;"Early."
12:27;12:31;"Yeah, it looks like a listener sends Jake an email"
12:31;12:35;"about Hot Cheetos' history and controversial presence."
12:35;12:37;"I think it was a listener email that might have alerted us."
12:37;12:41;"Really? I feel like Jake just knew the janitor thing."
12:41;12:43;"Well, anyway, just so people know,"
12:43;12:47;"it's like since that era, Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
12:47;12:51;"probably because of Richard Montaigne's really being out there"
12:51;12:54;"telling his story, becoming an interesting mix"
12:54;13:00;"of a motivational speaker, corporate food marketer,"
13:00;13:04;"somebody who had a story to tell about life in America."
13:04;13:08;"I think because of him, Flamin' Hot Cheetos just only grew bigger."
13:08;13:10;"Maybe he was already on that path. I don't know."
13:10;13:13;"But I think it already felt like a big deal in 2016."
13:13;13:15;"By 2021, it feels like--"
13:15;13:19;"Obviously, I'm a little biased because we talk about it on TC so much,"
13:19;13:22;"but it felt like Flamin' Hot Cheetos is the most talked-about"
13:22;13:24;"snack food in America."
13:24;13:29;"Well, and I feel like his profile has definitely risen"
13:29;13:31;"in the last five years."
13:31;13:32;"Oh, absolutely."
13:32;13:35;"I feel like when we first covered the story back in 2016,"
13:35;13:37;"it was a bit of an obscure find."
13:37;13:39;"And I guess a listener maybe clued us in."
13:39;13:43;"And it was sort of like, ""Wow, what a fun, cool little nugget of history."""
13:43;13:46;"But now I feel like when that story broke,"
13:46;13:48;"a lot of people were like, ""Oh, yeah, I know that story."
13:48;13:49;"Of course, Richard Montaigne."""
13:49;13:50;"Right, Richard Montaigne."
13:50;13:51;"They're making a movie about him."
13:51;13:52;"Yes."
13:52;13:53;"He's a fraud? What is this?"
13:53;13:56;"In the past couple years, there was--"
13:56;13:58;"I think he already self-published one book."
13:58;14:00;"He's about to release--"
14:00;14:01;"Multiple books."
14:01;14:03;"He's about to release another book about his story."
14:03;14:07;"And yes, Eva Longoria is set to direct a movie about his story"
14:07;14:11;"that takes place-- or that's going to film this summer."
14:11;14:14;"So, yeah, all those things, I think, really raised his profile."
14:14;14:17;"So, you know, maybe it was a matter of time"
14:17;14:20;"that somebody wanted to look under the hood and see what's up."
14:20;14:22;"So, basically, the story says--"
14:22;14:24;"Well, and here's the facts."
14:24;14:29;"It's like Richard Montaigne was a low-level worker at Frito-Lay."
14:29;14:31;"He was like-- worked at one of the machines."
14:31;14:33;"In Rancho Cucamonga."
14:35;14:39;"And he definitely did go from being a low-level employee"
14:39;14:42;"to being a pretty high-up marketing executive"
14:42;14:48;"who specifically helped create brands targeted at the Latino community."
14:48;14:53;"According to the article, a few years before Richard Montaigne's story"
14:53;14:55;"that he pitched this idea to--"
14:55;14:57;"'cause also just to remind people,"
14:57;14:59;"the story, I think, as we knew it,"
14:59;15:01;"was kind of that he was a janitor,"
15:01;15:03;"they were throwing out some Cheetos,"
15:03;15:05;"and he said, ""You know what? I got an idea."
15:05;15:08;"Let me take this s--t home, get him a little spicy,"
15:08;15:09;"put a little lime on him."""
15:09;15:11;"Then he brought it back in a big bag"
15:11;15:14;"and started giving them out and said to an executive,"
15:14;15:16;"""I think this could really go."""
15:16;15:18;"And maybe even made up the name."
15:18;15:20;"That's the story as we knew it."
15:20;15:23;"According to the article,"
15:23;15:26;"there was a team of marketing executives"
15:26;15:28;"already working in the Midwest."
15:28;15:29;"And food scientists."
15:30;15:31;"And the way--"
15:31;15:32;"Chemists."
15:32;15:34;"There are a lot of cool little nuggets in the story."
15:34;15:36;"You know, whatever the truth is,"
15:36;15:37;"I learned some interesting things."
15:37;15:42;"One is, you know who supplies the flavoring for Frito-Lay?"
15:42;15:43;"McCormick."
15:43;15:44;"I don't. I mean--"
15:44;15:45;"Oh, right."
15:45;15:46;"McCormick, which is kind of like"
15:46;15:49;"the supermarket brand of herbs and spices."
15:49;15:51;"And they make the Flamin' Hot dust."
15:51;15:52;"That'd be pretty tight."
15:52;15:53;"You know how like--"
15:53;15:55;"It's like some classic thing that"
15:55;15:56;"somebody has a little spice cabinet"
15:56;15:59;"and they have just all the McCormick products, nutmeg."
15:59;16:01;"And you know, it's kind of classy,"
16:01;16:02;"or at least homey."
16:02;16:06;"They should just be selling McCormick Presents Flamin' Hot"
16:06;16:08;"right next to the nutmeg and the sage."
16:08;16:09;"Oh, yeah."
16:09;16:11;"Do you throw that on some mac and cheese?"
16:11;16:12;"Oh, yeah."
16:12;16:14;"I can't believe they don't do that."
16:14;16:15;"I can't--"
16:15;16:18;"Even saying it's dust as a spice."
16:18;16:19;"Right."
16:19;16:22;"I mean, where are these marketing people?"
16:22;16:23;"That is such a good idea."
16:23;16:24;"Yeah, wait."
16:24;16:27;"You can't buy official McCormick X Frito-Lay"
16:27;16:30;"Flamin' Hot dust anywhere?"
16:30;16:32;"I can already picture the television ad."
16:32;16:34;"They'd license Gold Dust Woman."
16:34;16:38;"And did she make you cry?"
16:38;16:40;"Make you break down?"
16:40;16:43;"Pick up the pieces of your illusion?"
16:44;16:47;"Yeah, because that song already has some kind of cowboy energy."
16:47;16:49;"And it's like some weird Bae style dudes"
16:49;16:51;"who get off on spice."
16:51;16:52;"Oh, yeah."
16:52;16:55;"Just like [bleep] their mac and cheese"
16:55;16:58;"or their pizza crust or whatever"
16:58;17:01;"with just coating it in Gold Dust Woman."
17:01;17:03;"And as the ad is just like,"
17:03;17:05;"""Did she make you cry?"
17:05;17:07;"Make you break down?"""
17:07;17:09;"And dudes are just like, ""Oh, my God, dude!"""
17:09;17:10;"So hot."
17:10;17:11;"Yeah, how is that not--"
17:11;17:12;"So stupid."
17:12;17:14;"That should be right there next to the cinnamon."
17:14;17:17;"That should be like a top five spice to have it on."
17:17;17:20;"How about like kind of like Coca-Cola style?"
17:20;17:23;"You just randomly decide it's a Christmas product"
17:23;17:25;"just to get that end of the year boost."
17:25;17:27;"And you're just like--"
17:27;17:28;"You just start--"
17:28;17:31;"Every year after Halloween, you just start doing Flamin' Hot ads."
17:31;17:33;"It's like, ""It's that--"""
17:33;17:34;"It's like Jingle Bells."
17:34;17:35;"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
17:35;17:37;"And it's just like, ""It's that time of year again."
17:37;17:40;"Get ready for a red Christmas."""
17:40;17:43;"And it's like a snow globe, but the snow is like red."
17:43;17:46;"And just for whatever reason, we're just kind of like--"
17:46;17:48;"It wouldn't be Christmas time without Coca-Cola"
17:48;17:52;"or Flamin' Hot dust from McCormick."
17:52;17:53;"You put it on your popcorn."
17:53;17:56;"People are putting it on their sweet potatoes and stuff."
17:56;17:57;"Why not?"
17:57;17:58;"Christmas yams."
17:58;18:02;"♪ Rack on, Gold Dust Woman ♪"
18:02;18:05;"♪ Take your silver spoon ♪"
18:05;18:07;"♪ Take your friend ♪"
18:10;18:17;"♪ Heartless challenge ♪"
18:17;18:21;"♪ Pick your friend and outbreak ♪"
18:21;18:32;"♪ Wake up in the morning ♪"
18:32;18:35;"♪ See your sun rise ♪"
18:35;18:38;"♪ Let love go down ♪"
18:38;18:40;"Anyway, that's pretty cool."
18:40;18:43;"I didn't know that McCormick and Frida Lay had that alliance."
18:43;18:44;"I love that."
18:44;18:45;"It's great to know."
18:45;18:48;"So, you know, the true story, honestly, it's so dry."
18:48;18:49;"Or the supposedly true story--"
18:49;18:50;"Oh, my God."
18:50;18:51;"It's really dry."
18:51;18:55;"My first thought when I heard someone say"
18:55;18:59;"that they're poking holes in Montaigne's story,"
18:59;19:00;"he lied, he didn't--"
19:00;19:03;"Like, look, people lie, it's true."
19:03;19:07;"But also this feeling of like, we don't have a lot of heroes."
19:07;19:09;"And it seems like so far a lot of people,"
19:09;19:13;"including the screenwriter of the movie and the publisher,"
19:13;19:14;"and even Frida Lay,"
19:14;19:19;"they don't seem that interested in destroying his story."
19:19;19:23;"Because you know what's not a feel-good story?"
19:23;19:27;"What's not a feel-good story is a bunch of well-paid"
19:27;19:31;"marketing execs in the Midwest came up with the flaming hot,"
19:31;19:32;"you know, in a corporate--"
19:32;19:34;"I mean, although that's a good story for me."
19:34;19:36;"I mean, I'd watch that movie."
19:36;19:39;"I don't think that's the feel-good story that people care about."
19:39;19:42;"Yeah, it sounds like the real story is--"
19:42;19:45;"The way they describe it is also just like so corporate"
19:45;19:49;"that a bunch of marketing executives would go drive around the Midwest"
19:49;19:52;"and go pick up like snack foods they'd never heard of"
19:52;19:53;"at little mini-marts,"
19:53;19:55;"then bring them back and look at them,"
19:55;19:59;"and just be like, ""Are we getting beat by any of this bulls**t?"""
19:59;20:00;"It seems like the consensus was like,"
20:00;20:05;"""Yeah, we need some spicy red b**t because people are buying these weird brands."""
20:05;20:08;"It's such like a Mike Judge movie or something."
20:08;20:09;"Yeah."
20:09;20:11;"Mike Judge could make the counterpart."
20:11;20:14;"I also think of like Mike Judge teamed up with like Adam Curtis"
20:14;20:15;"and would make this."
20:15;20:17;"Because it's also very Adam Curtis where it's like"
20:17;20:19;"there's a mythology that we love,"
20:19;20:20;"and then we like learn the truth,"
20:20;20:22;"and we're just like, ""No, no, no, no, no."""
20:22;20:24;"Everyone just buries their head in the sand and is like,"
20:24;20:26;"""No, no, no, no. We like the story better."""
20:26;20:27;"Right."
20:27;20:30;"So it sounds like there's a couple people who take credit,"
20:30;20:32;"who are part of the team."
20:32;20:35;"Well, and also there's a classic thing here where the--"
20:35;20:37;"it sounds like the Frito-Lay story is basically,"
20:37;20:38;"yeah, there's a team,"
20:38;20:40;"a team of R&D people put it together."
20:40;20:43;"This woman named Lynn Greenfeld,"
20:43;20:45;"who had recently got her MBA."
20:45;20:48;"Sounds like she kind of spearheaded it."
20:48;20:49;"Somebody else maybe named it."
20:49;20:50;"I don't know."
20:50;20:52;"But then as I read the whole article,"
20:52;20:55;"it's a little strange because there's one dude"
20:55;20:59;"who was the CEO of Frito-Lay for a while"
20:59;21:01;"who says, ""No, I remember."
21:01;21:03;"Richard Montanez came in and pitched this to me."""
21:03;21:04;"Right."
21:04;21:05;"Al Carey."
21:05;21:06;"Right."
21:06;21:08;"But then the opposing side of that was that"
21:08;21:10;"in Montanez's book, he had--"
21:10;21:12;"there was like 60 references he pitched"
21:12;21:15;"to this other CEO in Ricoh or something"
21:15;21:19;"who didn't start working for Frito-Lay until like '91,"
21:19;21:23;"which was like a year after Flamin' Hot was on the market"
21:23;21:24;"or something like that."
21:24;21:26;"So the timelines were just--"
21:26;21:29;"I mean, it's so funny that it's only 30 years ago"
21:29;21:30;"and it's still like--"
21:30;21:33;"it just goes to show the fallibility of memory"
21:33;21:36;"and even like people can't even agree on"
21:36;21:38;"a story that really doesn't matter"
21:38;21:40;"in the grand scheme of things."
21:40;21:43;"It sounds like basically as Montanez's profile grew,"
21:43;21:45;"this one woman was kind of like, ""What?"""
21:45;21:46;"Yeah, there's another thing that kind of cracked me up"
21:46;21:48;"reading the article, which was,"
21:48;21:50;"you know, like Flamin' Hot was sort of like"
21:50;21:52;"big on the internet with like the kids."
21:52;21:58;"It was sort of like a meme object for younger people"
21:58;22:01;"and everyone that had worked on the original product"
22:01;22:03;"were like retired and like not hanging out"
22:03;22:05;"on that part of the internet."
22:05;22:07;"So this is only crossing their desk recently."
22:07;22:08;"Right."
22:08;22:09;"Kind of what we were saying,"
22:09;22:11;"like as Montanez's profile grew,"
22:11;22:13;"that's when they sort of like finally started"
22:13;22:15;"interacting with the story."
22:15;22:16;"Even though like Flamin' Hot had been"
22:16;22:18;"like sort of like a meme for years."
22:18;22:20;"Yeah, they had been checked out on the rise."
22:20;22:21;"Yeah."
22:21;22:23;"So what was Frito-Lay's actual statement about it?"
22:23;22:24;"Something to the effect of like,"
22:24;22:27;"while we still celebrate Richard,"
22:27;22:29;"we can't verify that he,"
22:29;22:31;"there's like our records indicate"
22:31;22:34;"he did not work on the development of Flamin' Hot,"
22:34;22:36;"but we still celebrate Richard."
22:36;22:39;"My theory, we haven't talked this,"
22:39;22:41;"my sort of QAnon theory about this"
22:41;22:45;"is that he is sort of a creation of the company."
22:45;22:48;"Like he's Fred the Baker, IRL."
22:48;22:51;"Like they want him to be the guy."
22:51;22:55;"And so they're mortified anyone is saying that he's not."
22:55;22:57;"Like he's the story."
22:57;23:00;"He's the, he's, and they did it in a way that's like,"
23:00;23:01;"would you ever be like Fred the Baker"
23:01;23:03;"doesn't really make the donuts?"
23:03;23:05;"Yeah, but we understand that Fred the Baker"
23:05;23:09;"is like an actor playing like a fictional character."
23:09;23:10;"Yeah, we think, we think."
23:10;23:11;"Colonel Sanders might be a good."
23:11;23:12;"Or Colonel Sanders."
23:12;23:13;"I just think that like,"
23:13;23:17;"but no, of course this is the Adam Curtis, you know."
23:17;23:19;"We need the story, like this is real."
23:19;23:21;"But I think that there's something,"
23:21;23:23;"so, you know, I think they were like,"
23:23;23:25;"here's this guy there and he just sort of was like,"
23:25;23:27;"I'll go along with this story."
23:27;23:29;"And he's essentially the mascot."
23:29;23:30;"It's a psy-op."
23:30;23:32;"So it's a psy-op and they're celebrating him"
23:32;23:35;"the way you'd celebrate your mascot."
23:35;23:38;"But it's too probably problematic."
23:38;23:39;"You can't call a real person."
23:39;23:40;"Well, hold on a second,"
23:40;23:43;"because there was something interesting in the article."
23:43;23:46;"Obviously, you get stories like this all the time,"
23:46;23:47;"especially in America,"
23:47;23:51;"where somebody will like fully fabricate an identity,"
23:51;23:52;"something like that,"
23:52;23:55;"some like P.T. Barnum or, you know,"
23:55;23:57;"just somebody coming out of nowhere being like,"
23:57;24:00;"yeah, I invented this and they can make it pretty far"
24:00;24:02;"until somebody's like, no, you didn't."
24:02;24:03;"You weren't, what are you even talking about?"
24:03;24:07;"It's not quite that cut and dry with Mr. Montanez"
24:07;24:10;"because he truly did have a remarkable story."
24:10;24:13;"He did, and I think does still work for Frito-Lay."
24:13;24:14;"And here's the thing."
24:14;24:15;"I think he's retired now."
24:15;24:16;"Oh, he's retired,"
24:16;24:18;"but he's still pulling in the big bucks with the speaking piece."
24:18;24:19;"I think they were like, yeah,"
24:19;24:21;"if you're doing the like motivational speaking,"
24:21;24:22;"you need to retire."
24:22;24:24;"He's out there hanging out with his good friend,"
24:24;24:26;"Oscar De La Hoya, just killing it."
24:26;24:28;"There's a lot of Oscar De La Hoya on his Instagram."
24:28;24:29;"Hell yeah."
24:29;24:31;"But here's the thing, which they say in the article,"
24:31;24:35;"at the very least, he did develop sabrositas."
24:35;24:36;"Is that what they're called?"
24:36;24:38;"Is that the Flamin' Hot popcorn?"
24:38;24:41;"No, but he was instrumental in the Flamin' Hot popcorn."
24:41;24:45;"So he is part of the Flamin' Hot story no matter what."
24:45;24:47;"Is that what it's called, sabrositas?"
24:47;24:49;"Yeah, it's under the Fritos umbrella."
24:49;24:54;"It's a Fritos sort of parallel to the Flamin' Hot."
24:54;24:56;"So it's almost like a Flamin' Hot Frito."
24:56;24:57;"Yeah."
24:57;25:00;"You know, maybe it's like Flamin' Hot is Fleetwood Mac"
25:00;25:03;"and he's like Stevie Nicks or Lindsey Buckingham."
25:03;25:04;"And they're just like,"
25:04;25:07;"""I know we weren't around for the first five albums,"
25:07;25:10;"the Peter Green era, but you know what?"
25:10;25:13;"When we came on, we made it Fleetwood Mac."
25:13;25:15;"And I don't care who started this band,"
25:15;25:18;"Fleetwood Mac is about Stevie Nicks"
25:18;25:19;"and Lindsey Buckingham or something."""
25:19;25:20;"You know what I mean?"
25:20;25:21;"It might be something like that,"
25:21;25:26;"where he really did do something so important for the brand"
25:26;25:29;"that he wanted to just simplify the story by saying,"
25:29;25:31;"""Well, look, that's human nature."
25:31;25:35;"People want to simplify stories just to make their story simpler,"
25:35;25:38;"just to make their story more straightforward,"
25:38;25:40;"perhaps for reasons of self-aggrandizing."""
25:40;25:43;"And if you tell that, that becomes your reality."
25:43;25:46;"I mean, it reminded me of the Brian Williams story."
25:46;25:50;"Remember, he was like,"
25:50;25:53;"he said he was in like a helicopter they got shot at,"
25:53;25:55;"like over Afghanistan or Iraq or something."
25:55;25:56;"Right."
25:56;25:58;"He'd been telling that story for a while"
25:58;26:00;"as like a wartime correspondent."
26:00;26:02;"And then someone was like, ""No, you weren't, dude."""
26:02;26:05;"And he got fired and it became this whole thing."
26:05;26:07;"I remember listening to this special,"
26:07;26:09;"his interview with him years later,"
26:09;26:12;"and he was talking about the fallibility of memory."
26:12;26:15;"He's like, ""Yeah, I guess I wasn't."
26:15;26:20;"I did report from Iraq, Afghanistan,"
26:20;26:22;"and I saw tons of crazy stuff,"
26:22;26:27;"but I guess somehow things got screwy in my head as time went on."""
26:27;26:29;"And that's the story I told myself."
26:29;26:31;"And then that became the reality."
26:31;26:33;"I mean, there's so many studies on memory."
26:33;26:36;"The things that you recall the most are the things,"
26:36;26:39;"like the memories in your head that you recall the most"
26:39;26:42;"are probably the farthest from actual reality"
26:42;26:44;"because it's like a tape that you play over and over again."
26:44;26:46;"And each time you play it in your head,"
26:46;26:48;"it gets a little degraded."
26:48;26:52;"And so I could see it being a situation like that."
26:52;26:54;"Can I posit a different theory?"
26:54;26:55;"Sure."
26:55;27:00;"He came up with his version of a similar Flaming Hot thing"
27:00;27:01;"and brought it there."
27:01;27:02;"And they'd already had,"
27:02;27:05;"there's like this kind of idea is out in the zeitgeist."
27:05;27:08;"As ideas are, and they're looking at other products,"
27:08;27:10;"he comes up with something and he says,"
27:10;27:11;"""I think I have something good."""
27:11;27:14;"The test markets are already out for these Flaming Hot Cheetos,"
27:14;27:17;"and it's actually Frito-Lay that looks at this guy"
27:17;27:20;"and they tell him he invented it."
27:20;27:23;"So you're going like full CIA."
27:23;27:27;"Yeah, I think that I was thinking when I was reading"
27:27;27:29;"in my version of what this movie would be,"
27:29;27:31;"and I wanted to pitch it to you guys,"
27:31;27:34;"is that we actually go with the LA Times story"
27:34;27:37;"and that guy's like, what is it, Pat O'Neill?"
27:37;27:38;"Tom O'Neill."
27:39;27:42;"He's chaos and he's looking at all the timelines"
27:42;27:45;"and what did this and really, yeah, it's full on."
27:45;27:48;"He's like, he's saying he was here at this point,"
27:48;27:50;"but he didn't graduate college or high school"
27:50;27:52;"and he's putting it all together."
27:52;27:54;"And really what we learn is that you have these"
27:54;27:57;"high-level executives at Frito-Lay who are basically like,"
27:57;27:59;"""This guy's going to be our patsy."
27:59;28:00;"We're going to make tell..."""
28:00;28:02;"So he thinks he invented it."
28:02;28:05;"Well, Montaigne has made a statement that sort of supports your theory."
28:05;28:09;"He said that at the time Frito-Lay had five divisions."
28:09;28:12;"He doesn't know what the other parts of the company were doing"
28:12;28:14;"and he'd never heard of Greenfeld."
28:14;28:15;"And he's quoted saying,"
28:15;28:17;"""I'm not even going to try to dispute that lady"
28:17;28:18;"because I don't know."
28:18;28:20;"All I can tell you is what I did,"
28:20;28:22;"all I have is my history, what I did,"
28:22;28:24;"what I didn't like."""
28:24;28:26;"""Which was given to me by a strange gentleman."""
28:26;28:28;"Well, he didn't talk about acid."
28:28;28:30;"I mean, he's..."
28:30;28:33;"""All I can tell you is I was doing a lot of acid on the time,"
28:33;28:37;"given to me by a military doctor."""
28:37;28:39;"To Frito-Lay."
28:39;28:40;"Okay, sorry."
28:40;28:42;"Frito-Lay brought in a military doctor."
28:42;28:43;"It wasn't an acid then."
28:43;28:46;"I mean, he didn't speak explicitly about the acid,"
28:46;28:47;"but he just said,"
28:47;28:50;"""All I have is my history and what I did in my kitchen."""
28:50;28:52;"Well, you know, I seem to recall,"
28:52;28:53;"I might have the number wrong,"
28:53;28:57;"but reading that written language,"
28:57;28:59;"which didn't exist in every culture,"
28:59;29:01;"not every culture had written language,"
29:01;29:03;"but it was, I don't know who you call it,"
29:03;29:07;"linguists or whoever studies the written language,"
29:07;29:08;"orthographists, whatever,"
29:08;29:11;"they can say that written language was invented,"
29:11;29:14;"they know for a fact it was invented like five times"
29:14;29:16;"in different parts of the world."
29:16;29:17;"Wow, independently."
29:17;29:20;"Independently, and that they can say,"
29:20;29:23;"like basically all written language stems from one of these,"
29:23;29:25;"I might have the number wrong, but five times,"
29:25;29:30;"like Arabic and somewhere in what's now called the Americas,"
29:30;29:33;"maybe like the Aztecs had a version of written language,"
29:33;29:35;"but that they can kind of trace written language"
29:35;29:37;"to a few separate places."
29:37;29:41;"So if, you know, human beings invented writing,"
29:41;29:43;"essentially five different times,"
29:43;29:46;"totally different styles, unrelated cultures,"
29:46;29:47;"not in contact with each other,"
29:47;29:50;"who's to say that in a big organization like Frito-Lay"
29:50;29:51;"in the late '80s, early '90s,"
29:51;29:55;"it could not have been invented different times."
29:55;29:57;"I also feel like that's some human nature (beep)"
29:57;30:00;"where like if people had an idea for something,"
30:00;30:02;"even if they didn't get to market first,"
30:02;30:04;"they'll still kind of be like, yeah, but you know,"
30:04;30:05;"I was there first."
30:05;30:06;"Yeah."
30:06;30:09;"Maybe it's not that crazy that the Midwestern division"
30:09;30:13;"could have been researching and starting to put out"
30:13;30:14;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
30:14;30:19;"It's not, is it impossible that Montañez could have been saying,"
30:19;30:23;"we need some more spicy products, did do a big pitch."
30:23;30:25;"And somebody was like, well, you know,"
30:25;30:27;"we've been rolling out these Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
30:27;30:28;"And he was like, let me try these."
30:28;30:29;"And he was like, okay,"
30:29;30:31;"this is exactly what I'm talking about anyway."
30:31;30:33;"Here's my, I don't know."
30:33;30:34;"It's not impossible."
30:34;30:35;"I like that."
30:35;30:37;"It's a more generous read."
30:37;30:39;"It's more ambiguous."
30:39;30:40;"Cause it'd be easy for, yeah."
30:40;30:44;"I mean like the headline was like Richard Montanez is a fraud,"
30:44;30:46;"which is like too hard."
30:46;30:48;"I didn't like that energy at all, which is tough,"
30:48;30:49;"which is real rough."
30:49;30:54;"And I like this more ambiguous kind of messy version or"
30:54;30:59;"convergent evolution with the Flamin' Hot product idea."

31:28;31:31;"we need some insight from some other people on this,"
31:31;31:35;"but I have seen people reference the racial angle of all this."
31:35;31:40;"That these Flamin' Hot products were often marketed"
31:40;31:43;"to people of Hispanic descent."
31:43;31:46;"And the story that of Richard Montaigne is being like,"
31:46;31:51;"I brought my culture to this big white owned corporation"
31:51;31:54;"and I changed culture and I did something."
31:54;31:56;"And he does talk about that a lot."
31:56;31:59;"Like he's involved in Mexican American charities"
31:59;32:01;"and foundations and stuff."
32:01;32:02;"And he, it's important to him."
32:02;32:04;"He's very proud of where he comes from"
32:04;32:05;"and he talks about it a lot."
32:05;32:07;"So there is this like funny angle too,"
32:07;32:11;"where obviously that story probably feels"
32:11;32:12;"a little bit better to imagine."
32:12;32:16;"All right, this like giant company actually allowed somebody"
32:16;32:19;"from like a different group to rise through the ranks"
32:19;32:21;"because they had a great idea and they brought their culture."
32:21;32:24;"Like that's kind of like some American dream type (beep)"
32:24;32:26;"But think about this, maybe in his head, he's like,"
32:26;32:29;"you know what, I (beep) invented Sabrositas."
32:29;32:32;"And that's just as important as Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
32:32;32:35;"But you know what, because it has more of a Spanish sounding name."
32:35;32:41;"These (beep) white meme Lords don't talk about it as much."
32:41;32:42;"So you know what, (beep) it."
32:42;32:46;"I'm backwards engineering Flamin' Hot into my story"
32:46;32:49;"because the gringos are never going to talk about Sabrositas"
32:49;32:51;"the same way they talk about Flamin' Hot"
32:51;32:53;"because it's simply not in English, you know?"
32:53;32:56;"- The writer of the film Flamin' Hot,"
32:56;32:58;"I think, you know, he's captured that spirit."
32:58;33:00;"He spoke to Variety and he said,"
33:00;33:02;"I think enough of the story is true."
33:02;33:05;"The heart and soul and spirit of the story is true."
33:05;33:09;"He's a guy who should remain the face of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
33:09;33:10;"Ultimately it doesn't matter."
33:10;33:13;"- I was reading a column right before we started taping"
33:13;33:15;"in the LA Times by Gustavo Arellano."
33:15;33:19;"And he was saying why people were so upset about this story."
33:19;33:21;"And it was sort of like, he outlined a brief history"
33:21;33:26;"of like gringo corporate world taking over Mexican food."
33:26;33:29;"There was Arch West who created the Dorito."
33:29;33:33;"He went down to Mexico for vacation in the 1950s or '60s."
33:33;33:35;"And he's like had tortilla chips,"
33:35;33:36;"which I guess were maybe a little novel"
33:36;33:38;"in the United States in the 1950s."
33:38;33:41;"And he's like, oh, we should take this tortilla chip idea"
33:41;33:44;"and make it corporate and put it in grocery stores"
33:44;33:45;"and call it Doritos."
33:45;33:47;"And then of course, famously Glenn Bell."
33:47;33:48;"- Glenn Bell, Taco Bell."
33:48;33:52;"- You know, would visit this taqueria in San Bernardino"
33:52;33:54;"near the original McDonald's location"
33:54;33:57;"and would grill this family"
33:57;33:59;"about how they were making their tacos"
33:59;34:01;"and then open Taco Bell."
34:01;34:04;"And so, you know, the story of Montaigne"
34:04;34:06;"is kind of flipping the script a little bit."
34:06;34:07;"People found some satisfaction in that."
34:07;34:09;"And then, so that's why I think there's a,"
34:09;34:10;"in this column he was writing,"
34:10;34:12;"that's why people were so upset"
34:12;34:14;"about the kind of reversal of it."
34:14;34:16;"- That happens a lot, strong emotions on both sides"
34:16;34:18;"and the truth might be a casualty,"
34:18;34:20;"but people wanna believe what they wanna believe."
34:20;34:23;"This is a tweet somebody sent me."
34:23;34:25;"Somebody named Rodrigo Nunez wrote,"
34:25;34:28;"""Richard Montaigne might not have invented hot Cheetos,"
34:28;34:30;"""but he got away with claiming he did"
34:30;34:31;"""and made a living off of that."
34:31;34:33;"""First Mexican to pull off a white man move"
34:33;34:35;"""with such efficacy."
34:35;34:36;"""A true pioneer."""
34:36;34:37;"So that's a take."
34:37;34:39;"- That's also a very American story."
34:39;34:41;"- Yeah, what if Montaigne came out and was just like,"
34:41;34:43;"""What did I do that's any different"
34:43;34:45;"""than what Glenn (beep) Bell did?"
34:45;34:47;"""And you (beep) people eating your Taco Bell."
34:47;34:48;"""Go to hell."
34:48;34:50;"""I invented this (beep)."""
34:50;34:52;"The movie's coming out next year."
34:52;34:53;"(laughing)"
34:53;34:55;"- I mean, Jake, you wrote to the text thread"
34:55;34:57;"that the movie just got a whole lot more interesting."
34:57;35:01;"And the reality is, I mean, the reality is like,"
35:01;35:03;"what kind of movie is it without this?"
35:03;35:05;"Like, this is a real third actor."
35:05;35:06;"- No, I know."
35:06;35:07;"This would be amazing."
35:07;35:09;"And this would be like making it into like a,"
35:09;35:11;"like a Steven Soderbergh or, you know,"
35:11;35:12;"Fincher kind of film."
35:12;35:15;"I mean, I hope that they address this in an upcoming film."
35:15;35:16;"I doubt it."
35:16;35:18;"Maybe, maybe they'll like rewrite the script."
35:18;35:19;"- That would be amazing."
35:19;35:20;"- Take it down to the studs."
35:20;35:21;"- You can make such a,"
35:21;35:23;"taking it down to the studs."
35:23;35:24;"That's a new Mountain Bruce song."
35:24;35:25;"- Yeah."
35:25;35:26;"- No, that'd be amazing."
35:26;35:29;"But one thing I've learned from reading more about the movie"
35:29;35:30;"and hearing from the screenwriter"
35:30;35:34;"is this movie is being produced by a well-known producer"
35:34;35:36;"of Christian films."
35:36;35:38;"And obviously there's many films that have Christian themes,"
35:38;35:40;"but when they say Christian films,"
35:40;35:43;"they mean specifically type of like inspirational,"
35:43;35:45;"feel good stories."
35:45;35:47;"- Aspirational family."
35:47;35:48;"- So."
35:48;35:49;"- (beep) that."
35:49;35:50;"- Yeah."
35:50;35:52;"- So the rights may come back to market"
35:52;35:55;"because they may say we can't do this story the way it is,"
35:55;35:57;"in which case maybe we all pool our money"
35:57;35:59;"and try to buy the rights to this."
35:59;36:01;"'Cause I think that making that sort of"
36:01;36:05;"lifetime inspirational movie up into the third act"
36:05;36:09;"when then the wheels fall off is a great movie."
36:09;36:10;"- I think we, yeah,"
36:10;36:12;"I think it's a time crisis presents"
36:12;36:15;"in association with Mike Judge and Adam Curtis."
36:15;36:16;"Those are the people I want to work with."
36:16;36:17;"- And Sunderbergh."
36:17;36:19;"(laughing)"
36:19;36:21;"- Well, also I kind of remember seeing a trailer"
36:21;36:25;"for a kind of inspirational Christian movie"
36:25;36:27;"that took place at a college."
36:27;36:29;"And I'm pretty sure, you know,"
36:29;36:31;"just like any kind of movie with an agenda,"
36:31;36:33;"they portray certain people"
36:33;36:35;"as these like really 2D caricatures."
36:35;36:37;"And as I recall in this movie,"
36:37;36:41;"it's a professor who's giving a lecture at a college"
36:41;36:44;"and going like, just like some smug"
36:44;36:45;"kind of like caricature of like,"
36:45;36:48;"just like a terrible liberal atheist."
36:48;36:49;"And this person goes,"
36:49;36:52;"and that is why we conclusively know"
36:52;36:54;"that God does not exist."
36:54;36:57;"And then there's like a Christian student who stands up"
36:57;36:59;"and is like, ""Um, professor?"""
36:59;37:00;"And he's like, ""Yes."""
37:00;37:03;"And the kid's like, ""Uh, can I ask you a question?"""
37:03;37:05;"And I think that's what the movie is."
37:05;37:08;"Is like basically this kid just like owning"
37:08;37:12;"this piece of (beep) smug atheist professor."
37:12;37:15;"And then like, I imagine in the movie by the end of it,"
37:15;37:17;"the professor's probably like down on his knees"
37:17;37:20;"just like, ""Please forgive me, Lord."""
37:20;37:21;"And it's not hard to imagine"
37:21;37:23;"what the atheist liberal version of that would be too,"
37:23;37:26;"where they would have a two-dimensional Christian character"
37:26;37:27;"just being like, you know."
37:27;37:28;"- Yeah, yeah."
37:28;37:30;"- But anyway, I could, if we went that route,"
37:30;37:32;"I could also picture they create,"
37:32;37:35;"and no disrespect to the talented journalist"
37:35;37:36;"who wrote this story,"
37:36;37:39;"but I could imagine they create this like weird caricature"
37:39;37:41;"of like a smug journalist"
37:41;37:43;"who comes to the Montanhas family home"
37:43;37:45;"and is just like, ""Open up, man."
37:45;37:47;"""I'm gonna take you down."
37:47;37:48;"""You better sit and talk to me."""
37:48;37:50;"And then like the door opens"
37:50;37:52;"and Montanhas is just like,"
37:52;37:54;"""You've been harassing my family for weeks now,"
37:54;37:56;"""but if you insist, come in."
37:56;37:57;"""I'll tell you my real story."""
37:57;37:59;"And the guy's like, ""Hell yeah."""
37:59;38:00;"And you see, he sits down on his couch"
38:00;38:02;"and this guy like texts his like friend,"
38:02;38:05;"just like, ""This chump just opened the door for me."
38:05;38:06;"""Scoop of a lifetime."""
38:06;38:09;"And then we cut back to him as he tells the story."
38:09;38:10;"And then by the end of it,"
38:10;38:12;"the journalist is just like a puddle"
38:12;38:16;"and is just like, ""I'm so (beep) sorry, Mr. Montanhas."""
38:16;38:18;"And he's like, ""It's all right, man."
38:18;38:21;"""Maybe you give them some Flamin' Hot Cheetos or something."""
38:21;38:25;"That would be like the really beautiful inspirational film."
38:25;38:26;"- Yeah, I mean, that's the ones"
38:26;38:28;"they're gonna probably make."
38:28;38:29;"- If they reference this at all."
38:29;38:30;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
38:30;38:34;"I would love just some serious, like just ambiguous,"
38:34;38:36;"just what the hell happened."
38:36;38:38;"Paul Thomas Anderson."
38:38;38:39;"(laughing)"
38:39;38:40;"Directs."
38:40;38:42;"- Well, I think that's the--"
38:42;38:43;"- Flamin' Hot."
38:43;38:45;"Flamin' Hot Mess, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson."
38:45;38:46;"And then by the end, you're just like,"
38:46;38:48;"""What the hell even happened?"""
38:48;38:49;"- 8/24."
38:49;38:50;"I'm in 8/4 production."
38:50;38:52;"- Just like three hours and 40 minutes."
38:52;38:55;"- What was the one he did, like Inherent Vice style,"
38:55;38:57;"where you're just like, ""What even was that?"""
38:57;39:01;"- How great a scene is it in the boardroom"
39:01;39:03;"where they're like, someone's like,"
39:03;39:04;"""But the story broke."
39:04;39:06;"""We're (beep)."""
39:06;39:07;"And he didn't create it."
39:07;39:09;"And another executive's like,"
39:09;39:10;"""Yeah, he did."""
39:10;39:11;"And he's like, ""No, he didn't."""
39:11;39:15;"""Well, not really, but why, he could've."""
39:15;39:17;"And you're just having this crazy conversation."
39:17;39:20;"And at the end, he goes, ""He needs to,"
39:20;39:21;"""like he's the creator."
39:21;39:22;"""That's it."""
39:22;39:24;"And he just is allowed to live his life"
39:24;39:26;"as reaping the rewards,"
39:26;39:30;"because as far as the last 20 years of his life is concerned,"
39:30;39:31;"he's the creator."
39:31;39:34;"- It's like that scene from the first episode of Chernobyl."
39:34;39:38;"Excellent miniseries, where like all these Frito-Lay people"
39:38;39:39;"are like freaking out,"
39:39;39:40;"and then they're just like,"
39:40;39:42;"""Wait, hold on a second."""
39:42;39:47;"The rarely seen kind of like executive major OG dude"
39:47;39:49;"from Rancho Cucamonga's coming in."
39:49;39:50;"He sits down, he's like,"
39:50;39:51;"""What seems to be the problem here?"""
39:51;39:52;"And they're just like,"
39:52;39:55;"""LA Times is calling Montaigne's a fraud."""
39:55;39:58;"And he's just like, ""Well, that's silly."
39:58;39:59;"""He invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."""
39:59;40:00;"And they're like, ""No, sir."
40:00;40:03;"""According to the article, he in fact did not."""
40:03;40:05;"""Well, that's strange, because he did."""
40:05;40:07;"""No, even our internal investigation"

40:16;40:18;"""Well, sir, we did check."
40:18;40:21;"""If I was you, I would go check again."""
40:21;40:22;"And they like start to get it,"
40:22;40:24;"and he's just like, ""Because of course,"

40:27;40:28;"""Of course, sir."
40:28;40:30;"""Maybe somebody got it wrong."""
40:30;40:34;"- Fully Soviet, fully corporate group think."
40:34;40:36;"I love it, I love it."
40:36;40:38;"- And then he doses the meeting."
40:38;40:41;"""Everybody, have a cup of this tea."""
40:41;40:44;"I really wonder if there's a little bit more to the story,"
40:44;40:49;"where Montaigne's actually had been dreaming of a spicy,"
40:49;40:52;"we need to know how widespread Flamin' Hot Cheetos were"
40:52;40:54;"in the first few years."
40:54;40:55;"I don't know, man."
40:55;40:58;"But that's cool that they're still making the movie."
40:58;41:00;"At least they seem to be right now,"
41:00;41:01;"the screenwriters out there."
41:01;41:03;"Eva Longoria's probably not trying to comment"
41:03;41:05;"on this too soon, but--"
41:05;41:07;"- If it comes out in theaters,"
41:07;41:10;"needless to say, we're all going."
41:10;41:11;"- Oh yeah."
41:11;41:12;"- TC Field Trip."
41:12;41:14;"Even though the Arc Light's closed,"
41:14;41:17;"we'll go to the AMC and Burbank or whatever."
41:17;41:19;"- Sorry, this is an important event."
41:19;41:20;"We're driving out to Rancho."
41:20;41:21;"- Oh, yeah."
41:21;41:23;"- We're doing a Cucamonga field trip for this."
41:23;41:24;"- True, true."
41:24;41:25;"- We're paying our respects."
41:25;41:26;"- You know who else would kill this?"
41:26;41:27;"Charlie Kaufman."
41:27;41:28;"- Oh yeah."
41:28;41:30;"- Yeah, I was just thinking,"
41:30;41:32;"the line, 'cause I was just thinking of it,"
41:32;41:34;"I wrote myself a good line for this movie,"
41:34;41:35;"but it was almost too comical."
41:35;41:37;"It would have to be if Charlie Kaufman did it,"
41:37;41:41;"which is, I like Ezra's take on that sort of exact,"
41:41;41:43;"you know, the head of Frito-Lay coming in."
41:43;41:45;"After that whole conversation, he says,"
41:45;41:46;"""Because do you know what happens"
41:46;41:49;"""if Montana did not create the Flaming Hot Cheeto?"""
41:49;41:52;"And the junior exec is like, ""No, I don't."""
41:52;41:55;"And his response is, ""That's right, because he did."""
41:55;41:56;"(laughs)"
41:56;41:58;"Like some kind of like, it's dark,"
41:58;42:02;"but then the guy, it's just diluted, kind of surreal."
42:02;42:04;"You don't want to live in a world"
42:04;42:08;"where Richard Montanez did not invent the Flaming Hot Cheeto."
42:08;42:11;"That, my friend, is a frightening world."
42:11;42:12;"That's a dark world."
42:12;42:14;"It's a violent world."
42:14;42:17;"Luckily for us, it's a world that doesn't exist."
42:17;42:18;"Do you understand?"
42:18;42:19;"(laughs)"
42:19;42:21;"- Who are you guys picturing as Montanez?"
42:21;42:24;"'Cause I'm kind of liking John Leguizamo for this one."
42:24;42:26;"I feel like he could get an Oscar out of this role."
42:26;42:27;"- I mean, I thought of Louise Guzman."
42:27;42:29;"- Well, I guess he probably is the right age."
42:29;42:30;"- Guzman is good."
42:30;42:33;"- But Louise Guzman has a lot of,"
42:33;42:35;"there's a lot of pathos in him too."
42:35;42:36;"- Oh yeah."
42:36;42:38;"- Well, I think they said they already casted."
42:38;42:39;"I don't know if they announced the names."
42:39;42:42;"They might not be super well-known actors."
42:42;42:44;"- Maybe someone younger than Guzman or-"
42:44;42:46;"- Well, also, yeah, no, it has to be,"
42:46;42:48;"'cause also we're going back to the beginning."
42:48;42:49;"We might need three different actors."
42:49;42:50;"- Early '80s."
42:50;42:51;"- It might be like a millennial pitch."
42:51;42:54;"- I mean, Louise Guzman, I bet Guzman's in his 50s."
42:54;42:57;"- Last pitch also is that it seems like"
42:57;43:00;"he and Lynn Greenfeld have no personal interaction,"
43:00;43:04;"but there's also the Fincher version, Social Network,"
43:04;43:07;"where the whole thing is framed by an arbitration"
43:07;43:09;"with lawyers, where,"
43:09;43:11;"because I was just thinking of the iconic line"
43:11;43:13;"from Social Network, which is like,"
43:13;43:15;"""If those guys invented Facebook,"
43:15;43:16;"they would have invented Facebook,"""
43:16;43:18;"which is also like that kind of weird,"
43:18;43:21;"like, ""I own the narrative, and you know what?"
43:21;43:22;"Whatever they might've done before me,"
43:22;43:24;"I did enough that I do own this,"
43:24;43:26;"because I'm here,"" right?"
43:26;43:27;"You know, which is like,"
43:27;43:29;"probably a lot of people feel that way."
43:29;43:30;"People buy into their own reality,"
43:30;43:32;"and certainly when it comes to business or anything"
43:32;43:34;"that could benefit somebody personally,"
43:34;43:35;"even more reason to buy into it."
43:35;43:38;"So that idea of like Zuckerberg just being like,"
43:38;43:41;"""Whatever you guys f***ing came up with before me,"
43:41;43:43;"the reason I'm here and you're there"
43:43;43:45;"is because I invented Facebook,"
43:45;43:47;"and if not, you would have been there."""
43:47;43:48;"So you could imagine Montaigne is just like"
43:48;43:50;"saying to like Lynn Greenfeld, just like,"
43:50;43:52;"although he's got a real cool demeanor"
43:52;43:53;"compared to Zuckerberg,"
43:53;43:57;"he'd just be like, ""Lynn, if you invented Flamin' Hot,"
43:57;43:59;"you would have invented Flamin' Hot."
43:59;44:02;"There'd be a movie directed by..."""
44:02;44:06;"It wouldn't be Eva Longoria if it was Lynn Greenfeld."
44:06;44:08;"""There'd be a movie about you."
44:08;44:11;"There'd be a book about you."
44:11;44:12;"But you didn't."
44:12;44:14;"There isn't, because you didn't."""
44:14;44:15;"Just like that kind of like..."
44:15;44:16;"- He's got the shades on."
44:16;44:17;"- Well, here's the thing."
44:17;44:19;"It seems like his book is still coming out."
44:19;44:21;"Penguin is gonna release it,"
44:21;44:23;"so we gotta read it."
44:23;44:24;"We gotta find out more."
44:24;44:26;"I wonder how doggedly the journalist"
44:26;44:27;"is gonna pursue this,"
44:27;44:29;"and maybe we will do a follow-up with him."
44:29;44:31;"I think it's good that we just kind of"
44:31;44:33;"hashed it out TC style today"
44:33;44:34;"before having any guests,"
44:34;44:37;"because I think there's more to learn, but..."
44:37;44:39;"- And I like this journalist being"
44:39;44:40;"sort of a part of that story."
44:40;44:42;"I think that that's gonna be really fun."
44:42;44:44;"I can see this,"
44:44;44:47;"'cause driven to take down this guy,"
44:47;44:48;"that's also complicated."
44:48;44:50;"That Zodiac, like having the Zodiac element."
44:50;44:52;"- Okay, so I think we decided"
44:52;44:55;"we're gonna offer the picture to Fincher."
44:55;44:56;"- I think so."
44:56;45:00;"- Fincher would absolutely crush this."
45:00;45:03;"- He just did Manc,"
45:03;45:05;"kind of black and white throwback."
45:05;45:09;"- Yeah, just even more esoteric and obscure,"
45:09;45:11;"the Flamin' Hot story."
45:11;45:13;"- I mean, he's..."
45:13;45:14;"- I think it's very broad."
45:14;45:16;"- Now, people are gonna love it,"
45:16;45:18;"and yeah, it's gonna look like the social network."
45:18;45:20;"It's gonna be kind of moody."

46:21;46:23;"of Whole Foods,"
46:23;46:26;"we're gonna do our chaos-type book"
46:26;46:28;"about Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
46:28;46:30;"Maybe we just call it Flamin' Hot Chaos."
46:30;46:32;"(laughing)"
46:32;46:34;"- Didn't we have a theory that Whole Foods"
46:34;46:36;"was actually like a CIA op?"
46:36;46:38;"- I think so."
46:38;46:40;"I'll just leave you with one more quote from Montaignez."
46:40;46:42;"He said, talking about Frito-Lay,"
46:42;46:44;"he said, ""I was their greatest ambassador,"
46:44;46:46;"""but I will say this."
46:46;46:47;"""You're going to love your company"
46:47;46:49;"""more than they will ever love you."
46:49;46:51;"""Keep that in perspective."""
46:51;46:52;"Damn. - Oof."
46:52;46:54;"- It's kinda hurt. - True words."
46:54;46:56;"- Although, it does seem like Frito-Lay"
46:56;46:58;"is being pretty mellow about it."
46:58;47:00;"I'm sure from Frito-Lay's perspective,"
47:00;47:01;"they're just like, ""Who cares?"
47:01;47:03;"""We like the story, we like Richard."
47:03;47:05;"""Whatever."" - Yeah."
47:05;47:07;"They interviewed people that worked for Frito-Lay"
47:07;47:09;"like 30 years ago, who were like,"
47:09;47:11;"""I don't remember Richard."""
47:11;47:13;"You know the current management at Frito-Lay,"
47:13;47:15;"when they caught wind of the story,"
47:15;47:17;"they were just like, ""Oh my God."
47:17;47:19;"""Really, LA Times?"""
47:19;47:21;"- Well, actually, a friend of the show,"
47:21;47:23;"she was on five years ago, Jennifer Sines,"
47:23;47:25;"I saw her name pop up."
47:25;47:26;"She was the CMO."
47:26;47:28;"She's really tight with Montaignez."
47:28;47:29;"She popped up in the article,"
47:29;47:31;"and she shouted him out,"
47:31;47:33;"and she's like, I don't know if she blurbed his book"
47:33;47:36;"or something, or, you know, they're tight."
47:36;47:38;"- I mean, look, the guy who wrote this"
47:38;47:40;"is clearly a very talented journalist,"
47:40;47:43;"and he did, by interviewing all those people,"
47:43;47:45;"piece out one significant thread of the story,"
47:45;47:48;"which Frito-Lay would say is the real story."
47:48;47:49;"He interviewed those people,"
47:49;47:51;"and he found out the Lynn Greenfields"
47:51;47:53;"and the Midwestern marketing people,"
47:53;47:54;"he did piece that together."
47:54;47:56;"So now it is a question of,"
47:56;47:58;"can all these things be true?"
47:58;48:01;"And we're gonna spend the next 20 years of our life"
48:01;48:02;"figuring that out."
48:02;48:05;"We're not disputing his journalism."
48:05;48:07;"We're just asking, you know, that's one article."
48:07;48:09;"We're asking in a book-length form,"
48:09;48:11;"what else can we find?"
48:11;48:14;"In 2041, Flamin' Hot Chaos is gonna drop."
48:14;48:17;"Maybe Tom O'Neill's serve as kind of like an advisor to us."
48:17;48:18;"We'll get him back on the--"
48:18;48:19;"- He's like, guys, don't do it."
48:19;48:20;"Don't do it!"
48:20;48:22;"- Guys, it's not worth it."
48:22;48:24;"You're gonna lose 20 years of your life."
48:24;48:26;"- Your marriages and your happiness are more important."
48:26;48:27;"- Oh, God."
48:27;48:29;"- 2041."
48:29;48:31;"- 2040."
48:31;48:34;"Me and Jake just like sharing like a studio apartment."
48:34;48:37;"We alternate who gets to like--"
48:37;48:39;"Like every other night, it's just like,"
48:39;48:41;"all right, it's Thursday."
48:41;48:42;"Jake, you get the bed tonight,"
48:42;48:43;"and you're like, hell yeah!"
48:43;48:45;"I'll crash out on the sleeping bag."
48:45;48:49;"- Apple canceled time crisis 10 years prior."
48:49;48:52;"(laughing)"
48:52;48:55;"You guys would not stop talking about"
48:55;48:57;"this Flamin' Hot origin story."
48:57;49:00;"I mean, listenership eventually just plummeted."
49:00;49:02;"- It's like once every few months,"
49:02;49:05;"we roll up just like unshaven, hair all (beep) up."
49:05;49:07;"We have brunch with Rashida, Hannah,"
49:07;49:08;"and our adult children."
49:08;49:09;"They're just like--"
49:09;49:12;"(laughing)"
49:12;49:13;"- Remarried."
49:13;49:14;"- Oh, yeah."
49:14;49:18;"They're like super cool, like buff, slick new husbands"
49:18;49:21;"who actually like work in corporate PR."
49:21;49:22;"(laughing)"
49:22;49:23;"- Yeah."
49:23;49:27;"- Just, he's like very like on edge,"
49:27;49:30;"like disheveled losers."
49:30;49:32;"- Rolling up."
49:32;49:33;"Oh my God."
49:33;49:34;"- Flamin' Hot chaos."
49:34;49:36;"I mean, that's a movie there too."
49:36;49:39;"I feel like we came up with five movies today."
49:39;49:41;"- That's pure Zodiac."
49:41;49:45;"That's pure Gyllenhaal and Downey in Zodiac,"
49:45;49:48;"just like losing it."
49:48;49:49;"- Oh, boy."
49:49;49:51;"Now for something completely different."
49:51;49:53;"Seinfeld, when we were texting"
49:53;49:55;"about all this Flamin' Hot chaos,"
49:55;49:58;"you hit the thread with an interesting product"
49:58;50:02;"that you had seen just doing your usual grocery shopping."
50:02;50:03;"You want to tell us a little bit about that?"
50:03;50:04;"- Yeah, sure."
50:04;50:06;"It was a few weeks ago, as I recall,"
50:06;50:07;"and I was in the grocery store,"
50:07;50:10;"just getting food products for my house,"
50:10;50:11;"and I happened across--"
50:11;50:12;"- Getting what?"
50:12;50:15;"- Food products for my house, for our pantry."
50:15;50:16;"- Okay, food products."
50:16;50:19;"- It was a Saturday night in the grocery store"
50:19;50:21;"getting food products for my house."
50:21;50:22;"(imitates gun firing)"
50:22;50:23;"(laughing)"
50:23;50:26;"- So there I am in the chip section,"
50:26;50:30;"and I happened across a product called Veggie Straws,"
50:30;50:32;"but what really drew my eye to it"
50:32;50:33;"was that it was an edition of,"
50:33;50:37;"it was a version of Veggie Straws called Screamin' Hot."
50:37;50:38;"I just thought it was funny"
50:38;50:40;"because obviously they're drafting off"
50:40;50:41;"of the Flamin' Hot name,"
50:41;50:43;"but the best that they could come up with"
50:43;50:44;"was Screamin' Hot,"
50:44;50:46;"which doesn't really, to me,"
50:46;50:49;"sound like an idiom in the vernacular."
50:49;50:50;"I've never heard anybody say,"
50:50;50:52;"""Oh, that was Screamin' Hot,"""
50:52;50:54;"and then I started thinking about,"
50:54;50:56;"well, you're eating it and then you're screamin'"
50:56;50:57;"'cause it's so hot,"
50:57;51:00;"or is the veggie straw itself so hot"
51:00;51:02;"that it's making a sound?"
51:02;51:03;"So I took a picture,"
51:03;51:06;"and the conversation just reminded me,"
51:06;51:08;"and then Ezra, you went on this whole tear"
51:08;51:11;"about how unhealthy veggie straws are."
51:11;51:13;"- That was like a classic kind of thread moment"
51:13;51:17;"when, kind of similar to some Zodiac/Flamin' Hot Chaos thing,"
51:17;51:20;"where a thread goes a little bit dead"
51:20;51:22;"except for two guys doggedly pursuing it."
51:22;51:23;"(laughing)"
51:23;51:24;"- Well, I was completely tapped out."
51:24;51:25;"- Jake was tapped out."
51:25;51:28;"Everybody, it was like kind of bedtime,"
51:28;51:31;"and me and Seinfeld were just going back about veggie straws"
51:31;51:32;"because when you sent that,"
51:32;51:35;"I think I was very interested in the Screamin' Hot angle"
51:35;51:36;"'cause it's kind of lame."
51:36;51:38;"Oh, you gotta have your Flamin' Hot,"
51:38;51:39;"it's gotta be Screamin' Hot, I agree."
51:39;51:41;"Kind of a strange word choice,"
51:41;51:43;"but then also just made me think about veggie straws"
51:43;51:46;"and specifically, well, this is something I found out."
51:46;51:48;"If you had asked me before yesterday,"
51:48;51:52;"I would have said that veggie straws is a brand."
51:52;51:56;"Now, it turns out, veggie straws is like Frosted Flakes."
51:56;51:58;"So to anybody listening at home,"
51:58;52:00;"anybody in the TC community,"
52:00;52:02;"go ahead and make your own veggie straws."
52:02;52:03;"You can."
52:03;52:06;"I looked it up, you can find all sorts of off-brand veggie straws."
52:06;52:08;"The one that most of us are familiar with,"
52:08;52:11;"the brand is Garden Veggie Straws."
52:11;52:14;"And anyway, the reason I was thinking about it is like,"
52:14;52:16;"that's just such a bad snack."
52:16;52:18;"And I'll admit, there's been times I've been starving"
52:18;52:21;"and I ate it and I kind of liked it,"
52:21;52:25;"but it's like, the fact that it's portrayed as being healthy,"
52:25;52:27;"they're so ugly."
52:27;52:29;"It's such like a styrofoam vibe."
52:29;52:31;"And there's something just truly,"
52:31;52:34;"I know this is overused in culture in general"
52:34;52:36;"and probably especially on TC,"
52:36;52:38;"but there's something about Garden Veggie Straws"
52:38;52:40;"that I truly find dystopian."
52:40;52:42;"It's like some Wally (beep)."
52:42;52:45;"It makes me imagine just like the remnants of human civilization"
52:45;52:47;"are living on a space station."
52:47;52:49;"Somebody's like, ""Time for your veggie straws."""
52:49;52:51;"They're sad, they're dry."
52:51;52:54;"The packaging always has so much air."
52:54;52:57;"The individual serving of veggie straws,"
52:57;52:59;"I'll admit, I've housed them."
52:59;53:02;"I've even semi-enjoyed them in moments of extreme hunger,"
53:02;53:04;"but there's something about it."
53:04;53:07;"It's just like, oh man, (beep) veggie straws."
53:07;53:08;"- The bag is full of air."
53:08;53:10;"The straws themselves are quite porous"
53:10;53:12;"and full of air as well."
53:12;53:14;"And also, why is it a straw?"
53:14;53:16;"- Yeah, why is it a straw? - I have a few questions."
53:16;53:17;"- Yeah."
53:17;53:19;"- I'm not familiar with this product."
53:19;53:21;"- At all? You've never had veggie straws?"
53:21;53:23;"- First of all, never heard of it or seen it."
53:23;53:26;"So is it literally a straw that you could drink V8 through?"
53:26;53:28;"(laughs)"
53:28;53:30;"And secondly-- - Great question."
53:30;53:33;"- Ezra, is this a regular grocery item at your house?"
53:33;53:35;"- No, where am I having these-- - What are you having"
53:35;53:36;"on these veggie straws?"
53:36;53:37;"You don't have beer in your house,"
53:37;53:39;"but you have veggie straws?"
53:39;53:40;"- Just like 11 p.m., just like,"
53:40;53:42;"""Babe, I'm doing a veggie straw run."""
53:42;53:44;"- Babe, I'm starving."
53:44;53:45;"I need some veggie straws."
53:45;53:46;"- Oh, maybe there's some veggie straws in the pantry."
53:46;53:48;"- Who the (beep) ate my screaming hots?"
53:48;53:49;"(laughs)"
53:49;53:51;"- You're down there just throwing them."
53:51;53:54;"- All this in the (beep) damn pantry is veggie straws."
53:54;53:56;"(laughs)"
53:56;53:58;"- This strikes me as like a green room type of item."
53:58;54:00;"- Yeah, maybe it's a green room item."
54:00;54:02;"Although maybe we did have veggie straws"
54:02;54:03;"in the house for a while,"
54:03;54:05;"and that's how I grew to hate them."
54:05;54:07;"Maybe we did end up with a big box"
54:07;54:09;"of individually wrapped veggie straws."
54:09;54:10;"God knows why."
54:10;54:12;"It seems like a green room thing."
54:12;54:13;"It just feels like a real sad,"
54:13;54:15;"kind of like waiting room vibe."
54:15;54:16;"Just like..."
54:16;54:20;"- Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,"
54:20;54:22;"do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
54:22;54:24;"(laughs)"
54:24;54:25;"Matt, cue up ""Waiting Room."""
54:25;54:26;"- That's Fugazi?"
54:26;54:27;"- Oh, yeah."
54:27;54:28;"- Tight."

55:08;55:10;"- Nick, are you familiar with veggie straws?"
55:10;55:12;"- Yeah, I am, 'cause I think that"
55:12;55:15;"it's sort of a standard kid's thing."
55:15;55:17;"- Right, and you have like a nine-year-old son."
55:17;55:18;"- I have a nine-year-old son."
55:18;55:19;"You know--"
55:19;55:20;"- Is he in the room?"
55:20;55:21;"- You don't keep him in the house."
55:21;55:22;"- Is he in the room?"
55:22;55:23;"- I'll get him in the room."
55:23;55:24;"I'll pull up a photo,"
55:24;55:27;"and he can say what his sort of immediate take on it."
55:27;55:28;"You know, I think with a nine-year-old,"
55:28;55:30;"he doesn't really have a food that he likes."
55:30;55:31;"Do you know what I mean?"
55:31;55:32;"I think it's just sort of like--"
55:32;55:33;"- Kind of like a picky age?"
55:33;55:34;"- Nothing?"
55:34;55:35;"- Chicken fingers?"
55:35;55:36;"- No, no, no, he'll sort of basically,"
55:37;55:39;"there's things he likes and things he doesn't."
55:39;55:41;"Do you know, I don't think that, you know,"
55:41;55:42;"and for the most part, it's like chicken fingers"
55:42;55:47;"and probably these veggie straws all fall into a similar,"
55:47;55:49;"like, they're getting the job done."
55:49;55:52;"They're calories, but I don't think he's,"
55:52;55:54;"you know, if it's not dessert, to be honest,"
55:54;55:55;"he really doesn't, you know,"
55:55;55:58;"if it's not dessert or spaghetti, does he really care?"
55:58;56:01;"I don't keep veggie straws in the house, though,"
56:01;56:05;"but I don't have what I imagine Ezra might have."
56:05;56:08;"We don't have like that drawer of snacks."
56:08;56:09;"Do you know, that just sort of like,"
56:09;56:11;"even if they're in the healthy, we just don't have that."
56:11;56:12;"That's just not--"
56:12;56:14;"- Trail mix? No?"
56:14;56:18;"- No, I keep trail mix 'cause I like trail mix."
56:18;56:19;"- Oh, hell yeah."
56:19;56:20;"- So you gotta have a snack drawer."
56:20;56:21;"- But I don't really have a snack drawer."
56:21;56:22;"Like, I remember growing up,"
56:22;56:25;"like Jordan Stein had just a sick snack drawer."
56:25;56:27;"- Shout out to Jordan Stein."
56:27;56:29;"- You know Jordan, you know--"
56:29;56:32;"- Mutual friend Jordan Stein."
56:32;56:35;"- As I said, I forgot, I think that Jake knows Jordan Stein."
56:35;56:37;"- Wait, Jake, you know this guy, Jordan Stein?"
56:37;56:38;"This is a real person?"
56:38;56:40;"- Yeah, small world style."
56:40;56:41;"I know him from San Francisco."
56:41;56:42;"- Well, yeah, but you know,"
56:42;56:46;"he had that sort of late '80s, early '90s snack drawer"
56:46;56:48;"that had like ho-ho, like, you know,"
56:48;56:50;"he had just like a lot of the snacks"
56:50;56:53;"that like my family would never keep, you know?"
56:53;56:55;"- Wow. - Like little Debbie's."
56:55;56:58;"- Wow, like just a decadent snack drawer."
56:58;56:59;"- A very decadent snack drawer."
56:59;57:01;"So, but I do think that I know"
57:01;57:04;"that there's a certain kind of snack drawers now"
57:04;57:09;"that will have like the individual like Annie's, you know,"
57:09;57:11;"or a big thing that I think kids eat now"
57:11;57:14;"is like the Pirate's Booty, like popcorn."
57:14;57:16;"Like that, I guess we do have,"
57:16;57:18;"there must have been a time with the veggie straws."
57:18;57:20;"- I mean, I was kind of looking it up,"
57:20;57:22;"like it looked like a dude named,"
57:22;57:25;"I think his name was Rick Bellow invented them,"
57:25;57:26;"but of course at this point"
57:26;57:28;"they're owned by a giant company,"
57:28;57:31;"Heinz Celestial Group, which is the same company"
57:31;57:34;"that Celestial is talking about, Celestial Seasonings Tea."
57:34;57:37;"So it's kind of like a vaguely health,"
57:37;57:40;"healthy-ish brand, they own Celestial Seasonings."
57:40;57:41;"- Have we covered Celestial?"
57:41;57:43;"- Yeah, yeah, we talked about their origin,"
57:43;57:46;"which I feel like was some Colorado hippies, I think."
57:46;57:48;"- Yeah, but I think it took a left turn."
57:48;57:49;"- Like they were members"
57:49;57:51;"of a kind of religious cult or something."
57:51;57:52;"- Yeah."
57:52;57:54;"- Although I'm sure at this point, you know,"
57:54;57:55;"it's owned by a giant company."
57:55;57:56;"Celestial Seasonings Tea,"
57:56;57:58;"Linda McCartney Foods,"
57:58;58:00;"Ella's Kitchen, Empire Kosher,"
58:00;58:02;"Terra Chips, Terra Chips,"
58:02;58:05;"also just like a funny, funny brand"
58:05;58:06;"and also veggie straws."
58:06;58:09;"All right, so we got an actual nine-year-old."
58:09;58:10;"Hey, what's up, Max?"
58:10;58:11;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
58:11;58:12;"- What's up, Max?"
58:12;58:13;"- Hello."
58:13;58:14;"- So you're nine?"
58:14;58:15;"- Yes."
58:15;58:17;"- You know what the kids are eating"
58:17;58:18;"in terms of snacks, right?"
58:18;58:21;"- Yes, garden veggie straws."
58:21;58:24;"So they're meant for,"
58:24;58:27;"you blow through them and drink things through it."
58:27;58:28;"That's what you do."
58:28;58:29;"- Wait, really?"
58:29;58:30;"- Wow, good call, James."
58:30;58:33;"- Would you ever actually drink something through it?"
58:33;58:34;"Or have you?"
58:34;58:36;"- I have before."
58:36;58:38;"I did it with water,"
58:38;58:40;"but then the bottom got all soggy"
58:40;58:41;"and it was terrible."
58:41;58:44;"- Wait, and so when are you and your peers"
58:44;58:47;"drinking beverages through garden veggie straws?"
58:47;58:49;"Where is this happening, at school?"
58:49;58:51;"- No, it happens at home."
58:51;58:53;"- Have we ever had these in our house?"
58:53;58:54;"- Yeah, we have."
58:54;58:56;"- Oh, so that's news to me."
58:56;58:57;"- Max, with you and your friends,"
58:57;59:01;"I imagine Flamin' Hot Cheetos are pretty cool, right?"
59:01;59:02;"That's a cool snack."
59:02;59:03;"- Yeah."
59:03;59:05;"- Invented, of course, by Richard Montanez."
59:05;59:06;"- Yeah, cool."
59:06;59:07;"(laughing)"
59:07;59:09;"- But you know, it's interesting."
59:09;59:12;"It's a cool snack 'cause it's like the bad boy of snacks."
59:12;59:13;"- It's a bad boy snack"
59:13;59:15;"and invented by a very cool guy, Richard Montanez."
59:15;59:18;"(laughing)"
59:18;59:22;"But Max, are garden veggie straws considered cool"
59:22;59:24;"when you and your friends are playing"
59:24;59:26;"League of Legends or whatever"
59:26;59:29;"and you're chatting with each other on the headset,"
59:29;59:30;"would you just be like,"
59:30;59:32;"""All right, fellas, who's eating what?"""
59:32;59:34;"Somebody be like, ""I'm crushing some veggie straws."""
59:34;59:36;"You guys would be like, ""Oh, jealous."""
59:36;59:39;"Is that what's happening in your community?"
59:39;59:40;"- No."
59:40;59:44;"I imagine this would happen in the 1990s,"
59:44;59:46;"but not in the 2000s."
59:46;59:47;"That's not what kids are like now."
59:47;59:50;"- Okay, but so when you and your boys are gaming,"
59:50;59:53;"what's a cool snack to be crushing?"
59:53;59:54;"- Cheetos."
59:54;59:55;"- Okay."
59:55;59:56;"- Hands down."
59:56;59:57;"Regular Cheetos or Flamin' Hot?"
59:57;59:58;"- Flamin' Hot."
59:58;59:59;"- But also, part of my question"
59:59;01:00:01;"is not just what you would enjoy eating,"
01:00:01;01:00:05;"but I know when people are playing video games together,"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"there's a lot of teasing,"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"a lot of competitive talk."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"- That doesn't happen to the people on the team."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"It happens to the people playing against us."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"- So if someone were playing against you,"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"if you were playing a game and they were like,"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"""Oh yeah, I'm over here and I'm eating these veggie straws,"""
01:00:24;01:00:27;"are you roasting that person?"
01:00:27;01:00:31;"- Um, I mean, I guess."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"I guess."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"- This is what I think."
01:00:33;01:00:36;"This is a pretty esoteric conversation"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"for a nine-year-old, I think."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"You know, I have a feeling."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"I can see it now."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"No one wants the veggie straws."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"- They have the word veggie in their name."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Right."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"- Veggie sort."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"- True."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- Great point."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- That is a good point."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"I think that--"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"- Strike one."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- Yeah, strike one."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Look, I'm looking at the thing right now."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"This has a whole lot of strikes going on."
01:00:58;01:01:02;"It's got the word garden, got the word veggie,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"and it's being sold by 30% less fat."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"I mean, that's like on the, you know--"
01:01:07;01:01:10;"- The I in veggie is a tomato."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- Four strikes."
01:01:12;01:01:16;"- I mean, who invented this, Michelle Obama?"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"But you know, the thing I think it has going for it"
01:01:19;01:01:23;"now that I can feel, it is sort of tactile."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"I can feel that you would blow through it."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Like when I asked Max, yeah, you would--"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"- Sorry, Max, have you actually drank a liquid"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"through a veggie straw?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Yes."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- Water."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"- Yeah."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"- 'Cause I can't think of another beverage"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"that would work well with that."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Chocolate milk would be disgusting."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"- Right."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- Mountain dew would be disgusting."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"V8 would work."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"- Oh, brown celery soda."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"You ever had that?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"- No, not familiar."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"- It's like an old school Jewish deli soda"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"called Cel-Ray, and I guess it's made out of celery somehow."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Clamato."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Oh, clamato, that'd be good."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Clam juice?"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- Clam juice would work."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"- (beep)"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"- I'm interested, do you--"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- It's a weird product."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- Is there a flavor profile to these two,"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"or do they all basically take--"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"- No, they're all the same."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"They're just different colors."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"They just wanted to rebrand,"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"and they just made them different colors."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"That's all they did."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"- But they're selling it as though,"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"like, one, I assume, is a carrot?"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- No, it's not."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"It's completely the same."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"It's just bread."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"- Well, listen to this, Max."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- It's made of bread."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"- Max, you probably already know this,"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"but in November 2013, Heinz Celestial,"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"the parent company of veggie straws,"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"Garden Veggie Straws, was targeted"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"in a class action lawsuit claiming"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"that they falsely labeled their products as organic"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"to mislead consumers into purchasing them,"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"and they settled."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- Who has the time to sue them?"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- And then in 2017--"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- That's a great question."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"- They were sued by two men after discovering"
01:02:52;01:02:56;"there are no actual vegetables in the veggie straws,"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"although the bag contains photos"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"of spinach, tomatoes, and potatoes on the front."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"So you're absolutely right that"
01:03:01;01:03:05;"it doesn't actually contain any of the vegetables,"
01:03:05;01:03:09;"although it contains something called spinach powder."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"I don't know."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Maybe these guys--"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"- It just doesn't contain meat."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"(laughing)"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- Right."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"- Therefore, it's veggie."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"(laughing)"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- Well, apparently this is a huge thing"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"I was reading about,"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"that there's been a lot of lawsuits with companies"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"where they label their product not as organic,"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"not as veggie, but merely as natural."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"(laughing)"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And there's been a lot of ink spilled"
01:03:33;01:03:38;"with court opinions, lawyers, corporate PR statements."
01:03:38;01:03:43;"Basically, because natural is such a vague term"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"that you can kind of like,"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"you can call almost anything natural."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"- You could call anything natural because--"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- Literally anything."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"- Humans are a product of the natural environment"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"and anything that humans make, therefore, is natural."
01:03:57;01:04:00;"- And anything on Earth is made in some way"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"from what God gave us."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Building blocks."

01:06:57;01:07:01;"and you can call that (beep) garden veggie whatever."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"- Yeah, technically, this plant material"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"was grown out of the earth."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"So that is a garden."
01:07:09;01:07:12;"- Butterfingers rolls out these green butterfingers"

01:08:09;01:08:12;"Even if you've seen it, you're not sure you ever saw it."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Like, Jake, you probably crushed 50 bags of them"

01:09:27;01:09:29;"Actually, it's orange, purple, and white."
01:09:29;01:09:33;"But they have little star-shaped,"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"almost like a Chex Mix style."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"- Oh, so it's like the classic veggie straws"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"is the stripes, and then they have the stars."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"- They got the stars thrown in."
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Seems like a missed opportunity"
01:09:44;01:09:48;"to not call it Straws and Stripes,"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"but there you have it."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- All right, well, I guess that could be"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"the TC July 4th challenge this year."

01:09:57;01:10:00;"are these Stars and Stripes veggie straws."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"And just use it as a conversation starter."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"See how people react."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"See who brings it up to you."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"See who's familiar with the product."
01:10:07;01:10:10;"And then also check in next day after"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"and see if anybody remembers it."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"- I think I've brought this up on the show before,"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"but there's a movie that I think"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"would be a good TC movie called"
01:10:18;01:10:21;"Led Zeppelin Played Here, about a show."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- Not familiar."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- It's a documentary."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Maybe we should have this guy call in."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"It's a documentary by the guy"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"that made Heavy Metal Parking Lot."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"And it's about a show that Led Zeppelin played"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"in Maryland in 1969,"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"but there's no actual record of it."
01:10:35;01:10:38;"- Like it could be a collective delusion?"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- Yes, people remembering seeing Led Zeppelin"
01:10:40;01:10:44;"in 1969 playing at a high school auditorium in Maryland,"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"but it's actually not on their itinerary."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"- And there's no surviving posters"
01:10:49;01:10:50;"or anything like that?"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"- No, there's no documentation of the show."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"There's no, yeah, exactly,"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"like official documentation of the show."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"But people swear they saw,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"like many people in Maryland"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"swear that they saw Led Zeppelin play"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"at this specific, yeah, anyway,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"I think we should watch that as a,"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"I think it should be a TC movie club."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- Okay, let's watch that for next time."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"- On the steam of like collective memory"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"and collective delusion."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"- And then we'll make a follow-up,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"another film from TC Films."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"- Oh, the I Ate Veggie Straws."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"- Veggie straws were eaten here."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"No, they weren't."
01:11:23;01:11:26;"Anyway, if anybody has any good veggie straws stories,"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"please let us know."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"I feel like we barely scratched the surface"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"with veggie straws."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Although maybe we got to try these screaming hots."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"It sounds pretty good."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"All right, should we get into the top five?"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"- It's time for the top five."
01:11:39;01:11:42;"Five on iTunes."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"- It's been a long time"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"since we've done a true comparative top five,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"but we're going for it today."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Getting back to our roots."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"And we're going to be comparing"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"the top five Billboard hits this week,"
01:11:53;01:11:58;"2021 to the top five in 1990."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"Why 1990?"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"- That was the year that Frito-Lay"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"released a test version of Flamin' Hot."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"- So this was the year that they first tested them,"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"unbeknownst to Mr. Montaignez,"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"who half a country away"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"was dreaming of a similar product."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Doesn't prove anything."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"We should also point out,"
01:12:18;01:12:21;"a lot of times we'll do the top five songs"
01:12:21;01:12:25;"on Apple Music, the streaming charts,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"but we chose not to this week"
01:12:27;01:12:30;"because all five of them are dominated by one artist."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"That artist is J. Cole."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"We got nothing against him."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"People don't need to hear us"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"hear five J. Cole songs for the first time."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"And you know, like, it's not good radio."
01:12:39;01:12:42;"- But Jake, do you know who J. Cole is?"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"- No, I mean, I've heard of him."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Because I do this show."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"I've been doing this show"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"that sort of will occasionally"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"delve into contemporary music."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- Have we talked about J. Cole before?"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"- I've heard of him only because of this show."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- His full name is Jake Colestreth."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- Oh!"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- John Jake Colestreth."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"(laughing)"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"He's an American painter and rapper."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"I think he's from, where's he from, North Carolina?"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"- Yeah."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- I don't know that much about him,"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"but he always seemed like an interesting dude to me"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"because he's like, really popular rapper,"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"but like, truly on his own trip."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"- What do you mean?"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"- Well, there used to be a meme, kind of,"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"that was based in truth,"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"that was kind of making fun of passionate J. Cole fans."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"And as I recall, and Seinfeld,"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"you might remember this better than me,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"you're a meme expert,"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"basically the meme was,"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"it would be used in different contexts,"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"but basically it was poking fun"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"at the J. Cole fans' obsession with the fact"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"that he had gone double platinum with no features."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"- He didn't have any, like,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"other famous rappers' gaslighting songs."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"- Exactly, no features, and obviously,"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"hip hop, often, you know,"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"a lot of great music comes about through features."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"I guess a hater might say that"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"some albums have too many features"
01:13:58;01:14:03;"or they feel kind of like, a little bit R&D'd"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"in a corporate way, it's like,"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"let's get that guy on that song,"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"and that guy, that person on that song,"
01:14:08;01:14:11;"you know, just to kind of spread your chips out on the table."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"I think that's the kind of, like, cynical view"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"of an album with a lot of features."
01:14:16;01:14:18;"And also, I think they're also just saying,"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"he did it by himself."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"This is truly a man apart."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"And this man didn't need anybody else,"
01:14:24;01:14:27;"any other rappers to feature on his album,"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"it was him speaking his truth,"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"and he went double platinum."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"So it is, you know, people might have joked about it,"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"but it is something to be proud of."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"So he weirdly is like this huge,"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"I know this is gonna sound just like,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"almost like, groan-worthy TC type (beep)"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"He's almost like on some Grateful Dead (beep)"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"where, truly on his own trip--"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"(laughing)"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"- First time they've come up this episode."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- All right, yeah, so we're doing pretty good."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"But like, truly on his own trip,"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"this is my understanding, and again,"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"I've never gone really deep,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"but it's somebody's on their own trip,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"really has a big audience,"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"and other people don't quite get it sometimes,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"and are even harsh about it,"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"but truly built something of their own."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"You know, the Grateful Dead are on some"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"double platinum with no features (beep)"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"- For sure."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"- So anyway, that's J. Cole,"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"and we don't need to listen to five J. Cole songs,"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"although we encourage you to go check out his new album,"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"I just don't think you need to hear us--"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"- Yeah."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"- Even by the second one, we'd already be like,"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"what are we talking about?"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"But somebody was just saying that,"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"speaking of being on his own trip,"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"he's not even in America right now."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Seinfeld, you said he's in Rwanda?"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"- Yeah, he's signed with this Rwandan basketball team,"
01:15:36;01:15:40;"the Rwandan Nationals, I think?"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Let's see."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"Oh, it's the Patriots, the Rwanda Patriots."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"- The Pats."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"- Pats, yeah, the Rwanda Pats,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"and I was seeing on Twitter the other night"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"that they won their first,"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"whatever game they were playing, they won."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"So it looks like J. Cole is definitely an asset to the team."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Congratulations, J. Cole."
01:15:58;01:16:02;"- I hope someone makes this sort of J. Cole Rwanda,"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Grateful Dead Lithuania shirt."
01:16:04;01:16:09;"- Ooh, like a tie-dye shorts and jersey combo."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"- Yeah."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"- That's pretty tight."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- That's wild."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Is he a starter on that Rwandan team,"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"or is he like the 11th man on the bench?"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"That's crazy."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"- That'd be pretty brutal if J. Cole flew to Rwanda,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"and he didn't get any game time."
01:16:23;01:16:26;"- Right, I mean, it's just like--"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"- He's a shooting guard,"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"and he's a big basketball fan."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Actually, all his albums have a basketball theme."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"- Well, clearly he's a big basketball fan."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"- But I mean, to the extent that it's made its way"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"into his music and to the iconography of his--"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"- Wow."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- But yeah, you're right."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"I mean, if he's on a professional basketball team,"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"yeah, he must like the sport."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"- This is like when the dead played Egypt, man."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"Not a lot of people going to play in front of the pyramids."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"- Have you read a lot about that?"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"The dead playing at the pyramids?"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- A decent amount."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"- Who was at those shows?"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Like people that lived in Cairo?"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"Like deadheads, like Egyptian deadheads,"
01:17:03;01:17:07;"or like French deadheads that came over for the weekend?"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"- I think a lot of American deadheads made the trek."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"- That went all the way over."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"- Yeah, and I don't think it was like a huge audience"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"by dead standards."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"- Yeah, I've heard those shows weren't very good."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"- That's what they say."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"I'm sure they're just being hard on themselves, but you know."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"- That's really trippy to think about."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Can you imagine now just like,"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"didn't go with John Mayer,"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"or like Fish playing at the pyramids."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"It's like, it's hard to picture."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"- And they had to really work hard to get over there,"
01:17:33;01:17:34;"as I recall reading."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Like, you know, they had to get like"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"the State Department involved."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"- Oh, I'm sure."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"- It's also pretty amazing,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"'cause if something like that happened now,"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"it would obviously be for the 'gram."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"You know, like it would be,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"you'd have this audience for social media."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Doing it then was literally"
01:17:50;01:17:54;"for no one outside of the company there."
01:17:54;01:17:57;"Like, there's no marketing element around it."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"- I mean, yeah, rock shows in front of the pyramids"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"is like a,"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"I guess depending on the band,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"it's like a cool idea."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"If it's sort of like Limp Bizkit's"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"playing in front of the pyramids,"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"I'd just be like, oh man, that's rough."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"- I'd watch that."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"- I'd check it out."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"- By the way, J. Cole was not a starter."
01:18:15;01:18:17;"Matt did some number crunching,"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"and he came off the bench."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"In the final minute of the first quarter,"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"he got three points, three rebounds,"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"and two assists in 17 minutes."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Is that good?"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"- Sorry, so he played 17 minutes total."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"- Yeah, Matt--"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"- So he sounds like he's like a sixth or seventh man."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"- Yeah, I think so."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"- Okay, so--"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"- This is real love of the game (beep)"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"- It's not go to Rwanda so you can start."
01:18:39;01:18:42;"It's go to Rwanda so you can like"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"play like a third of the game."
01:18:44;01:18:47;"- Maybe he's killing two birds with one stone."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"- Respect."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"- Maybe he wanted to go to Rwanda,"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"spend some time there, get to know the country,"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"and he wanted to play basketball,"
01:18:54;01:18:57;"and it's like, it's not about starting."
01:18:57;01:18:59;"- Love of the game."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"- And also, as I recall, with the Dead show,"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"I think they filmed it,"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"and they were planning on making the money back,"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"'cause it must have been extremely expensive"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"to schlep all that stuff for a one-off show."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"I think they were planning on filming it,"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"releasing a record and a movie"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"to kind of make their money back,"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"and they just didn't think they played that well,"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"so they're just kind of like,"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"""All right, (beep) it, man."""
01:19:22;01:19:24;"I don't know, like late '70s,"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"just like, ""We're $975,000 in the hole."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"""It is what it is."""
01:19:28;01:19:30;"- Those must have been some bad shows,"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"'cause like, I mean,"
01:19:32;01:19:36;"we're all familiar with like the dregs"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"of like the live catalog of the Dead."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"It can get pretty--"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"- How bad could it be?"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"- It can get pretty gnarly,"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"as a guy that's been listening to--"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"- Maybe like ""Piano"" was out of tune or something."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"- Yeah, like as someone that's been looking"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"at like the weird desert,"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"like, ""Oh man, when the sun set,"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"""the temperature dropped like crazy,"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"""and everything went out of tune."""
01:19:54;01:19:58;"- Jake, we gotta call into Steve Parish's radio show"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"next time, just be like,"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"""Steve, how bad were those shows really?"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"""What was the problem?"""
01:20:03;01:20:06;"Just like, ""Well, Jake, I'm glad you asked that, man."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"""When the sun sets in the desert,"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"""boy, does it get cold."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"""We had some serious tuning issues."""
01:20:11;01:20:15;"- It dropped 25 degrees in the course of 15 minutes."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"- No, 'cause I mean,"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"as someone that's been listening"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"to the Dead series station pretty consistently"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"for like five or six years,"
01:20:22;01:20:25;"and they play some absolute dog (beep) station,"
01:20:25;01:20:30;"I've never once encountered a track"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"from the Egypt shows."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"Never once."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"I've never heard a single track."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"- I don't think I've ever heard, wait."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"- Can you just bring it up?"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"- Is it on archive.org?"
01:20:42;01:20:43;"- Matt, can we play this?"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"- I love how this is how we're starting the top five,"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"by the way."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- I think Richard Pictures--"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"- Yeah, it's on Apple Music, guys."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"- Oh, it is?"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- Do you wanna hear it?"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"- Okay, so--"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"- Yeah, yeah, I wanna hear it."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"- It looks like maybe--"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"- Richard Pictures in front of the pyramid?"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"- It looks like they didn't release it"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"until 30 years later."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"So I don't think it came,"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"it did not come out in Jerry's lifetime."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"- What year was this that they did this?"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"'78?"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"- Is there a track you wanna hear, Jake?"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"- Read the set list."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"- What's the track listing?"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"- Yeah."
01:21:09;01:21:13;"- Jack Straw, Roe Jimmy,"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Nu Nu Mingle with Blues,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Candyman Looks Like Rain,"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"Stagger Leaves, I Need a Miracle."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"- It's a good set list, except for Miracle."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Throw in Roe Jimmy."
01:21:22;01:21:25;"(chuckles)"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"(smooth jazz music)"
01:21:53;01:21:58;"Julie catch a rabbit"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"by his head"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"It's a little slow."
01:22:03;01:22:08;"Come back stepful"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"like you walk on air"
01:22:11;01:22:18;"Back to where you belong"
01:22:18;01:22:23;"Don't you come up no more"
01:22:23;01:22:29;"- What's interesting is Jerry put out"
01:22:29;01:22:32;"Cats Under the Stars, I think in '78,"
01:22:32;01:22:36;"which has that sort of Egyptian iconography"

01:44:20;01:44:22;"""Yeah, God's awesome, right?"""
01:44:22;01:44:24;"And I was like, ""Hmm."" - Hell yeah."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"- Hell yeah."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"And it was like, ""I know, God's the best."""
01:44:27;01:44:29;"And then I was just listening to this conversation"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"about how great God is."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"I mean, it was really, there wasn't a lot of substance."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"It was just two guys talking about God."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"- I was just talking to them the other day."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"- Did these guys seem to know each other?"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"- Talking to God, like, on Tuesday."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"- No, they didn't."
01:44:41;01:44:45;"It seemed as though they didn't know each other."
01:44:45;01:44:46;"And they were just-- - Interesting."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"How did that conversation start?"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"- Well, I don't know."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"I was there when it started,"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"and it started sort of like this,"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"but my eyes were closed."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"I was really trying to sort of breathe myself"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"through the heat of this sauna."
01:44:56;01:45:01;"And then I sat up, and I really came sort of face to face"
01:45:01;01:45:05;"with, I was like, ""Oh, sh*t."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"""You're Justin Bieber."""
01:45:08;01:45:12;"And then he sort of asked me where I was from."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- So he's just being like real kind vibe,"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"just you're another dude in the sauna."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"He wanted to include you in the conversation."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"- Yes, he wanted to include me in the conversation,"
01:45:20;01:45:21;"and maybe so I couldn't immediately--"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"- Hey, stranger."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"- Yeah, hey, stranger."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"- Hey, stranger, where are you from?"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"- Maybe you can't immediately, yeah."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"And maybe you can't immediately get involved"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"in this God conversation,"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"so I'll just ask you where you're from."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"- That's classy."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"- And I was like, ""Oh."""
01:45:33;01:45:34;"I thought it was very classy,"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"and I said, ""I'm from here."""
01:45:35;01:45:36;"He goes, ""You're always from here?"""
01:45:36;01:45:38;"And I was like, ""No, no, I lived in Atlanta before."""
01:45:38;01:45:39;"And he said--"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"- Oh, he said, ""Oh, I get my peaches out there."""
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- He actually said, saying better, he goes,"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"""I think I still own a house there."""
01:45:44;01:45:46;"(laughing)"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"- I think."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"- I think, I think as well."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"And I was like, ""Oh, yeah."""
01:45:49;01:45:51;"And obviously I know you famously lived there"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"when you moved from Canada to work with Usher"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"in your teens."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"And I was like, ""Oh, yeah, that's cool."""
01:45:58;01:46:00;"And then the guy, you know,"
01:46:00;01:46:05;"we talked a bit more about sort of top level sort of stuff,"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"and then that guy left who was talking about God."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"And then Justin Bieber says to me, he goes,"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"""Man, that guy was wild."""
01:46:14;01:46:16;"(laughing)"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"And I was like, ""What?"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"""Like you didn't, you weren't part of that?"""
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Like actually that's when I first realized,"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"like, ""Oh, you didn't know that guy."""
01:46:23;01:46:24;"- Well--"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"- You're just spreading kind vibes."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"That guy wanted to come here,"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"he recognized you were Justin Bieber"
01:46:28;01:46:29;"in a sort of a public space."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"- Well, it's probably that guy,"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"that guy knew that Justin Bieber is Christian,"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"and maybe that guy was like trying to think,"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"""What's a cool thing to say to Bieber"
01:46:36;01:46:37;"""if I hit him with some like,"
01:46:37;01:46:40;"""'Oh, dude, your first album changed my life.'"""
01:46:40;01:46:42;"He might be like a little bit,"
01:46:42;01:46:46;"""So let me just connect with him on love of God."""
01:46:46;01:46:47;"- On a God level."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"And then after this whole thing,"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"there was a couple other moments"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"where I could just sort of,"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"it really did click to me."
01:46:53;01:46:56;"I was like, ""Oh, Bieber is doing what you said."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"""He's spreading, he's connecting,"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"""and he knows what people want from him,"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"""and he's gonna give it to them."""
01:47:01;01:47:03;"And then I left, I took a shower,"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"and I was leaving, and I was like,"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"""Oh, s--t, I forgot something back inside."""
01:47:06;01:47:07;"So I had gone out to my car,"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"and I ran back inside,"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"and Bieber at this point was leaving,"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"and I was describing something,"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"and he said, ""Oh, hey,"" to me."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"And I was like, ""Oh, yeah?"""
01:47:14;01:47:16;"And he goes, and he came to give me a hug,"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"and he goes, ""That was really fun."""
01:47:18;01:47:19;"- Aw."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"- And he gave me a hug,"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"and I realized, oh, for him,"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"yeah, this was probably like a night out."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Like, this was a connecting with the people moment"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"in a sauna."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"- So he rolled to a sauna by himself."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"- In West Hollywood."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Yes."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"- Did you see any big dudes?"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"- No, no, I do, no."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"I think that there was one big dude who I'd,"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"you know, it's a Russian bath,"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"so it's kind of hard to know exactly"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"who's with Bieber and who's with not,"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"but I did see someone there that I was like,"
01:47:45;01:47:47;"""I think this guy's with Bieber."""
01:47:47;01:47:48;"But he was in there alone."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Like, he was..."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"LARPing as a normie."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"- This story makes Bieber sound chill as hell."
01:47:54;01:47:57;"- I honestly, like, it really endeared me to him."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"- All right, well, that definitely contextualizes"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"the ""I get my light from the source."""
01:48:02;01:48:05;"Like, Bieber's tapped in."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- He did say, ""Maybe I'll get a small peach"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"on my body somewhere."""
01:48:09;01:48:13;"I promised myself I didn't want to get tattoos on my hands,"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"and so I don't think I'm going to get tattoos on my hands."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Something about just being able to wear a suit"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"and not having tattoos on my hands."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"I agree, Justin."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"So maybe he's out of room, is what he's saying?"
01:48:24;01:48:25;"- Right, I mean, Justin is, you know,"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"let's say one of these days,"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"you want to give up the music stuff,"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"you want to get a job at a bank,"

01:48:32;01:48:35;"they're not going to look too kindly on hand tattoos."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"So, you know, do whatever you want on your chest,"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"your back, whatever."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"But when you want to put a suit on,"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"keep the hands clean."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"- That's a wild story, Nick."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"- Yeah, it was really great."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"- Okay, the number..."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"I'm going to burn through the rest of this."

01:52:37;01:52:38;"Well, okay, but--"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"And 2021 sucks, so it's just, like--"

01:52:42;01:52:44;"I think this is, like--"
01:52:44;01:52:47;"The 1990s stuff is so depressing."

02:03:41;02:03:43;"- Well, it's also-- there really is something, like--"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"I'll have to do some research, but it's like,"
02:03:45;02:03:48;"of course there's always, like, these retro movements,"
02:03:48;02:03:50;"like Lou Bega, Mambo No. 5,"
02:03:50;02:03:53;"where he's doing some kind of-- he's dressing like he's from,"
02:03:53;02:03:55;"like, the '40s or something, but there is--"
02:03:55;02:03:57;"there's something interesting about this song."
02:03:57;02:03:59;"It's like a-- - Yeah."
02:03:59;02:04:02;"- No anxiety trying to bring in some, like,"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"modern hand clap to give it, like,"
02:04:04;02:04:07;"""All right, this is, like, not like some early Meghan Trainor."""
02:04:07;02:04:09;"- Yeah. - Or it's doo-wop, but, you know,"
02:04:09;02:04:12;"with some-- truly, like, an attention to detail"
02:04:12;02:04:15;"and a sophistication that, in another era,"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"you would probably find more in, like,"
02:04:17;02:04:21;"some, like, nerdy hipster music,"
02:04:21;02:04:25;"which obviously these lines have been crossed."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"Interesting moment. We might look back on this"
02:04:27;02:04:29;"as, like, a real landmark No. 1"
02:04:29;02:04:32;"with our Adam Curtis voiceover. - Yeah."
02:04:32;02:04:35;"Absolutely. - It's old, but it's different."
02:04:35;02:04:38;"- ""There was no anxiety of influence."""
02:04:38;02:04:40;"- Vanished. - I can't do a British accent."
02:04:40;02:04:42;"I wish I could do a British accent. - I like your--"
02:04:42;02:04:44;"that's-- that feels right."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"Through the looking glass and a history,"
02:04:46;02:04:49;"but gonna leave the door open."
02:04:49;02:04:51;"History's over, but we're gonna leave the door open."
02:04:51;02:04:53;"Gonna think about what that means."
02:04:53;02:04:55;"Anyway... - Damn."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"- Good seeing everybody. Remember, God is awesome."
02:04:58;02:05:01;"And if you see a stranger in the sauna,"
02:05:01;02:05:03;"treat 'em with kindness."
02:05:03;02:05:05;"Whether your day makes you feel like Bieber in the sauna"
02:05:05;02:05:07;"or Obama on the Peloton,"
02:05:07;02:05:10;"just remember to hold on, Father John."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"Um, all right. - Damn, dude."
02:05:12;02:05:14;"- See you in two weeks. Peace!"
02:05:14;02:05:18;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra Koenig."
