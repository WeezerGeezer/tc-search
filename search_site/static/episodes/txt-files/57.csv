00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis Grammy nomination edition."
00:05;00:10;"But we'll also be talking to Gigi Son about Net Neutrality"
00:10;00:14;"and Kazzy David about Thanksgiving."
00:14;00:18;"All this, plus Jake and I dig in"
00:18;00:23;"to the music being honored at Music's Biggest Night."
00:23;00:26;"This is a very special..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:33;"B-B-B-B-B-B-Beasts."
00:33;00:35;"One."
00:35;00:37;"They passed me by"
00:37;00:40;"All of those great romances"
00:40;00:44;"They were a fellow I believed"
00:44;00:47;"All my rightful chances"
00:47;00:50;"My picture clear"
00:50;00:55;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:55;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow"
00:59;01:02;"One of us had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is lying"
01:12;01:17;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back in action."
01:19;01:22;"First Time Crisis of December."
01:22;01:24;"It's nice to be in the holiday season, I think."
01:24;01:27;"LA's been too hot. It's finally cooled off a bit."
01:27;01:30;"Was it 90 last week? 'Cause that was gone."
01:30;01:32;"Yeah, it hit 90 the week of Thanksgiving."
01:32;01:33;"That's annoying."
01:33;01:35;"The world is toast, man."
01:35;01:38;"Very pessimistic about the future of this world."
01:38;01:40;"Even if we fix half this stuff, it's..."
01:40;01:42;"It's just too hot."
01:42;01:45;"What did your dad think? 'Cause this was his first trip to California?"
01:45;01:49;"Right. My family came out to LA for Thanksgiving,"
01:49;01:51;"and this was my dad's first time in California."
01:51;01:55;"Yeah, a lot of people have asked me, ""Oh, did your family have a good time?"""
01:55;01:57;"Like, ""What'd your dad think of LA?"""
01:57;02:00;"And it's hard for me to describe it, but we kind of have a family trait."
02:00;02:02;"Of course everybody had a good time."
02:02;02:04;"Got the whole family together."
02:04;02:07;"So that's always nice, getting together and everybody hanging."
02:07;02:09;"So of course we enjoyed that."
02:09;02:12;"But it's not that he liked or didn't like LA."
02:12;02:15;"It's just that we just don't, like, talk like that."
02:15;02:16;"Like, kind of stoic?"
02:16;02:20;"Yeah, I guess it's kind of like just more of an ""it is what it is."""
02:20;02:21;"Right."
02:21;02:24;"Like, a lot of people were saying, ""Oh, you gotta take your dad to the beach."""
02:24;02:27;"And I was like, ""He doesn't care."""
02:27;02:29;"It's not that he's, like, pro or anti-beach."
02:29;02:31;"It's just kind of like--I don't know."
02:31;02:33;"I feel like we're just kind of the family where it's like,"
02:33;02:37;"they could sit at my sister's house in Silver Lake, have a cup of coffee."
02:37;02:39;"They could also schlep over to the beach."
02:39;02:41;"Either--what's the difference, kind of?"
02:41;02:44;"Sit in the car for 75 minutes."
02:44;02:45;"Yeah."
02:45;02:46;"Get to the beach."
02:46;02:48;"You know what's funny?"
02:48;02:50;"My sister took my parents on a hike in Griffith Park."
02:50;02:51;"Okay, yeah."
02:51;02:54;"And I think they made it up to the observatory."
02:54;02:56;"I wasn't there, but I could also picture them being like,"
02:56;02:57;"""Yeah, we made it up here."""
02:57;02:58;"Yeah."
02:58;03:00;"It sounds so negative, but it's truly neutral."
03:00;03:02;"We were down there, now we're up here."
03:02;03:04;"Got some steps in, that's good."
03:04;03:06;"And now we're going to go back down."
03:06;03:09;"I guess it's also a thing where people are just calibrated differently"
03:09;03:11;"in terms of the type of language they use."
03:11;03:13;"And I've tried to be cognizant of that in my life"
03:13;03:16;"because there's times when people say, like,"
03:16;03:18;"""Oh, I thought you didn't like me at first,"""
03:18;03:20;"or ""I thought you didn't like this thing that I showed you,"""
03:20;03:23;"when my memory of it is that I said, ""Wow, that's really cool."""
03:23;03:24;"And you know what I mean?"
03:24;03:26;"This is a classic thing about communication."
03:26;03:27;"So flat."
03:27;03:30;"Or like, ""Well, it depends how well you know somebody."""
03:30;03:31;"Right."
03:31;03:33;"I've always, my whole life--and you know, you and I are not that different."
03:33;03:38;"I've been very wary of people who I find to be enthusiastic in a phony way."
03:38;03:39;"Sure."
03:39;03:42;"So if I showed somebody--let's say I'm working on a song, as I do,"
03:42;03:44;"if I play it for somebody and they're just like,"
03:44;03:47;"""Man, this is unbelievable! I love it!"""
03:47;03:49;"""This is the best."""
03:49;03:50;"""This is the best."""
03:50;03:51;"""This is your best song you've ever written."""
03:51;03:52;"""Yeah, it's great."""
03:52;03:54;"I'm going to be a little bit like, ""Okay."""
04:32;04:36;"Well, he looked down at my silver chain."
04:36;04:41;"He said, ""I'll give you one dollar."""
04:41;04:46;"I said, ""You've got to be joking, man."""
04:46;04:50;"It was a present from me mother."
04:50;04:53;"He said, ""I like it. I want it."
04:53;04:56;"I'll take it off your hands and you'll be sorry."
04:56;04:58;"You cross me."
04:58;05:03;"You better understand that you're alone."
05:03;05:08;"Alone with the bone."""
05:08;05:11;"And I say, ""I don't like reggae."
05:11;05:13;"No, no."
05:13;05:17;"I love it."
05:17;05:22;"I don't like reggae."
05:22;05:27;"I love it."
05:27;05:29;"Don't you grab me, style."
05:29;05:31;"Don't you queer me, bitch."
05:31;05:34;"Don't you walk through my words"
05:34;05:38;"'cause you ain't heard me talk yet."""
05:38;05:39;"If I remember growing up as a kid,"
05:39;05:44;"my parents would talk about a movie being a great movie."
05:44;05:47;"Whereas I can't remember too many times where"
05:47;05:50;"they would ever talk about a city being like--"
05:50;05:51;"Great?"
05:51;05:53;"Yeah, or like a view."
05:53;05:54;"Well, here's a question."
05:54;05:55;"I'd ask him this."
05:55;05:56;"Yeah."
05:56;06:00;"How does the reality of LA correspond to your mental vision of it?"
06:00;06:02;"'Cause you've now had 60-something years--"
06:02;06:03;"Right."
06:03;06:06;"--to create a imaginary LA in your head"
06:06;06:09;"and you've seen tons of movies and blah, blah, blah."
06:09;06:10;"What is it like in real life?"
06:10;06:13;"Yeah, see, that's the type of question he might find more interesting"
06:13;06:16;"because that actually makes you think about--"
06:16;06:20;"It's not some kind of random judgment, good or bad."
06:20;06:22;"It's kind of like, ""You know what?"
06:22;06:24;"Yeah, did you see anything in LA that surprised you?"""
06:24;06:25;"Right."
06:25;06:30;"""Is there anything that you noticed that you found funny?"""
06:30;06:34;"Yeah, those are kind of a more nuanced conversation."
06:34;06:37;"But even with you, Jake, have you ever been like--"
06:37;06:40;"You ever get back from a trip and just be like, ""How was the trip?"""
06:40;06:46;"And you're just like, ""Boston was unbelievable."""
06:46;06:50;"When was the last time you just were super jazzed on something"
06:50;06:53;"and you were telling somebody about it and you were--"
06:53;06:54;"Like at a place?"
06:54;06:55;"Well, I saw you saw the--"
06:55;06:56;"Oh, the Hockney Show."
06:56;06:58;"Yeah, so I saw on Instagram that you were in New York"
06:58;07:00;"and you went to the David Hockney Show."
07:00;07:01;"Retrospective."
07:01;07:03;"So I think you wrote on Instagram--"
07:03;07:04;"What did you say?"
07:04;07:05;"I said it's a knockout."
07:05;07:06;"It's a knockout."
07:06;07:09;"The first four rooms, a total knockout."
07:09;07:10;"But that's Instagram language."
07:10;07:11;"No, no, no."
07:11;07:12;"But you know me."
07:12;07:16;"I don't go hard on Instagram with like, ""You guys,"
07:16;07:18;"""The Deuce is the greatest show."
07:18;07:19;"""You have to watch it."""
07:19;07:20;"Well, it's on this picture."
07:20;07:22;"I mean, I like The Deuce, don't get me wrong."
07:22;07:24;"Let's pretend that you didn't write about it on Instagram."
07:24;07:27;"It was like, ""Oh, Jake, I saw you went to New York,"""
07:27;07:31;"and you say, ""Yeah,"" and then I say, ""You catch any cool art?"
07:31;07:33;"""You're an artist, you like to go see art when you're nerdy?"
07:33;07:34;"""You see anything cool?"""
07:34;07:35;"Yeah."
07:35;07:36;"What was it?"
07:36;07:38;"The David Hockney retrospective."
07:38;07:39;"How was it?"
07:39;07:40;"Pretty amazing."
07:40;07:42;"Okay, so you're not that excited."
07:42;07:43;"You did use the word ""amazing."""
07:43;07:45;"You even said ""pretty amazing."""
07:45;07:47;"""Pretty amazing"" is kind of funny because you're qualifying."
07:47;07:50;"Yeah, pretty amazing."
07:50;07:51;"But what would you say to me?"
07:51;07:52;"Pretty stupendous."
07:52;07:54;"It was a knockout."
07:54;07:57;"I wouldn't say that in person."
07:57;07:59;"No, I know what you mean."
07:59;08:02;"I actually was very excited about that Hockney show,"
08:02;08:03;"I have to tell you."
08:03;08:05;"Like, I was unusually excited."
08:05;08:08;"Was there a pep in your step when you left the museum?"
08:08;08:10;"Were you walking on air?"
08:10;08:14;"I was walking on air for maybe about five minutes."
08:14;08:17;"The problem was that the second half of the show really fell off."
08:17;08:18;"Oh."
08:18;08:21;"And I almost wanted to leave the show and leave the museum altogether"
08:21;08:27;"just to retain the feeling I had from the first, like, five rooms of the show."
08:27;08:28;"You know, that's interesting, too."
08:28;08:29;"I want to just keep the impression."
08:29;08:32;"It's also about how honest you want to be sometimes"
08:32;08:35;"because, like, sometimes it's easy just to describe something as amazing"
08:35;08:38;"just because you're not trying to have, like, a deep nuance conversation."
08:38;08:39;"Right."
08:39;08:40;"Just kind of like we all make that mistake sometimes."
08:40;08:42;"You see somebody, you vaguely know, ""How you doing?"""
08:42;08:44;"Like, ""Well, you know, it's been up and down."""
08:44;08:45;"They don't care."
08:45;08:47;"They just want you to be like, ""It's been great."""
08:47;08:49;"And it's the same thing sometimes when you see something."
08:49;08:51;"I feel like--let me see if I can thread this together."
08:51;08:54;"I was thinking about--there's something really funny about how--"
08:54;08:59;"I feel like in the '80s and '90s when there would be movie reviews,"
08:59;09:02;"there would always be one of the dumb movie reviews"
09:02;09:04;"that they would stick in the trailer or something."
09:04;09:06;"Be like, ""Amazing, incredible, Tom Cruise's finest work."""
09:06;09:08;"And there's always that one person be like,"
09:08;09:11;"""You'll be walking on air when you leave the theater."""
09:11;09:14;"There's always something that would describe how happy you'll be when you leave."
09:14;09:17;"It's just like this weird cliche of movie reviews."
09:17;09:20;"And then, of course, the movie marketers love that"
09:20;09:22;"because they're telling the people--"
09:22;09:24;"It's also similar to, like, with toothpaste."
09:24;09:27;"You want that fresh from the dentist clean."
09:27;09:29;"You want that feeling that you have after you just did something."
09:29;09:31;"No, I don't."
09:31;09:35;"You want to be--it's like your regular life sucks."
09:35;09:39;"So you have these brief windows, such as when you left a great film"
09:39;09:41;"or you left the--"
09:41;09:43;"Twice a year when you go to the dentist."
09:43;09:45;"Or you left the dentist where for those three hours"
09:45;09:47;"where your mouth actually felt clean"
09:47;09:51;"before you just started wailing on bags of Cheetos again."
09:51;09:55;"But there used to be this promise that you'd go do something"
09:55;09:58;"and you'll have a good feeling that'll linger with you."
09:58;10:02;"Whereas in the Internet era, it's a really hard promise to make."
10:02;10:05;"So it's like, ""Go see Lady Bird."
10:05;10:08;"You'll feel so good when you leave the theater."""
10:08;10:09;"It's like, no, you won't."
10:09;10:11;"Even if you love Lady Bird, you leave the theater,"
10:11;10:16;"you look at your phone, you'll be depressed in 30 seconds."
10:16;10:19;"Right? Like, yeah."
10:19;10:22;"So that's why it's funny if you saw somebody a week after they saw--"
10:22;10:24;"You have to be a very optimistic person for a week after you saw a movie"
10:24;10:28;"or saw a Hockney exhibition to be like, ""Oh my God."""
10:28;10:32;"Even just thinking about it now, I'm still so excited about it."
10:32;10:35;"I was walking on air a little bit when I left Lady Bird."
10:35;10:37;"For how long?"
10:37;10:39;"Um, 30."
10:39;10:40;"That's solid, man."
10:40;10:42;"It also was very nostalgic for me"
10:42;10:45;"because Greta and I went to Columbia at the same time."
10:45;10:46;"Oh, wow."
10:46;10:48;"This is one of those weird things where I still can't remember"
10:48;10:50;"if I ever met her on campus."
10:50;10:52;"I definitely remember meeting her a few years ago"
10:52;10:54;"and just being like, ""Hey, what's up?"""
10:54;10:56;"You know, like, she's one of these people that you just see"
10:56;10:58;"and then there's somebody there in movies and you can't remember."
10:58;11:00;"Like, ""Did I know you?"""
11:00;11:02;"But I did find it moving to think about, you know,"
11:02;11:04;"somebody exactly my age."
11:04;11:07;"It made me nostalgic for a lot of things."
11:07;11:09;"Yeah, that movie's powerful."
11:09;11:12;"Yeah, because you know it's about her life"
11:12;11:17;"and you really get that sense of, like, a major fork in the road in life."
11:17;11:20;"Like, if she had not applied to college in New York"
11:20;11:23;"and had the help from her dad to apply for college in New York"
11:23;11:28;"and she had just gone to Davis, she wouldn't be Greta Gerwig."
11:28;11:35;"DJ Shadow went to UC Davis and he became a very famous trip-hop DJ."
11:35;11:36;"So..."
13:48;13:56;"All right, Jake, but we could wax poetic about films and David Hockney forever,"
13:56;14:01;"but we got to kick it into high gear because today's show--"
14:01;14:03;"are you as excited as I am?"
14:03;14:08;"I'm very enthusiastic about today's show because we got Kazzy David coming in,"
14:08;14:09;"friend of the show."
14:09;14:14;"We're going to talk about Thanksgiving and the Grammy nominations."
14:14;14:16;"We got all sorts of stuff to talk about."
14:16;14:21;"But first, time crisis, we've made a commitment to our listeners,"
14:21;14:28;"our very poorly informed listeners who rely on us as a news source"
14:28;14:30;"to give them at least a little bit of hard news,"
14:30;14:33;"and everybody's been talking about net neutrality."
14:33;14:35;"There's a big vote coming up,"
14:35;14:38;"going to decide whether or not America still has net neutrality."
14:38;14:41;"Man, we barely even know what net neutrality is."
14:41;14:44;"So we're going to talk to Gigi Son."
14:44;14:47;"Gigi Son is a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute"
14:47;14:49;"for Technology, Law, and Policy."
14:49;14:53;"Previously, she held the position of counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler."
14:53;14:56;"So we got someone who used to work at the FCC, so she knows her stuff."
14:56;14:59;"In a previous statement, Mr. Wheeler singled out Gigi Son"
14:59;15:02;"as the conscience of the chairman's office for her tireless advocacy"
15:02;15:05;"on behalf of American consumers and competition"
15:05;15:08;"and was named one of 2015's Heroes Who Saved the Internet"
15:08;15:10;"in recognition of her role in the FCC's adoption"
15:10;15:13;"of the strongest ever net neutrality rules."
15:13;15:15;"We're going to talk to an internet hero."
15:15;15:18;"She's going to explain to us what net neutrality is and why we should care."
15:18;15:19;"So let's get her on the phone."
15:19;15:23;"Now, let's go to the time crisis hotline."
15:23;15:26;"[phone ringing]"
15:26;15:27;"Hi, Gigi."
15:27;15:28;"Hi."
15:28;15:30;"Hi, you're on with Ezra and Jake."
15:30;15:31;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
15:31;15:33;"Hi, delighted to be here."
15:33;15:40;"So we know you're very overqualified to talk about the basics of net neutrality,"
15:40;15:43;"but a lot of Time Crisis listeners don't read the news,"
15:43;15:45;"and they only check in every two weeks through our show."
15:45;15:46;"Right."
15:46;15:49;"And frankly, Jake and I are a little uneducated on the topic ourselves."
15:49;15:53;"So the first question is, what is net neutrality,"
15:53;15:55;"and why is everybody freaking out about it?"
15:55;16:01;"So net neutrality is the principle that the company that provides internet access--"
16:01;16:06;"companies like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Charter--"
16:06;16:10;"it's a principle that they shouldn't pick winners and losers on the internet,"
16:10;16:15;"that they shouldn't be able to favor or discriminate against certain online services."
16:15;16:17;"So let me give you an example."
16:17;16:22;"Have you ever heard of the craft company Etsy?"
16:22;16:23;"Sure."
16:23;16:25;"They sell wonderful crafts online."
16:25;16:27;"Well, eBay is a competitor, right?"
16:27;16:29;"Everybody's heard of eBay."
16:29;16:36;"Imagine if eBay paid Comcast to get to you, the consumer, faster,"
16:36;16:38;"and Etsy couldn't afford to."
16:38;16:40;"What would that mean for Etsy?"
16:40;16:43;"It would probably mean Etsy would be in a whole lot of trouble"
16:43;16:48;"because people don't have a lot of patience for when websites load slowly."
16:48;16:53;"I think the studies have shown that three seconds and people are, like, out."
16:53;17:00;"So imagine that all the biggest online companies--Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay--"
17:00;17:06;"could pay to get to the customer faster, and all the small startups could not."
17:06;17:08;"What does that mean for innovation?"
17:08;17:10;"What does that mean for startup culture?"
17:10;17:14;"So net neutrality prohibits that kind of favoritism."
17:14;17:20;"It also prohibits an internet service provider from blocking or throttling--"
17:20;17:25;"basically making a website come up in a lousy fashion or slowly."
17:25;17:30;"So net neutrality really protects the internet as it was intended to be."
17:30;17:35;"And it was intended to be a place where you and I control our internet experience"
17:35;17:38;"without somebody in the middle doing so instead."
17:38;17:42;"It's kind of like if we compare--a lot of these services are internet and cable companies,"
17:42;17:47;"and anybody who's ever had cable can think of times when you get those weird commercials"
17:47;17:50;"that's just like, ""Comcast doesn't want you to have Comedy Central."
17:50;17:53;"In 30 days, they'll be getting rid of Comedy Central. Call up Comcast."""
17:53;18:00;"Or sometimes people who are into sports might randomly, unexpectedly not have access to a game"
18:00;18:05;"because their cable company is in a dispute with the team or something like that."
18:05;18:11;"So that stuff already happens with TV is the idea that could it actually get that bad?"
18:11;18:15;"Let's talk about if there's no net neutrality besides speed,"
18:15;18:21;"could it get as crazy as being like Time Warner got in a dispute with Twitter."
18:21;18:27;"Twitter wouldn't pay up, so all Time Warner users in California and Oregon"
18:27;18:30;"will not have access to Twitter for the next seven months"
18:30;18:33;"until Twitter can work out a payment program. Could it be that bad?"
18:33;18:38;"It could be that bad. And actually, something like that happened a number of years ago."
18:38;18:41;"And I may be confusing the companies, but bear with me."
18:41;18:48;"There was a dispute, I believe it was between Charter and one of the big broadcast networks."
18:48;18:53;"I don't remember if it was ABC, NBC. I think it was CBS. But bear with me here."
18:53;18:59;"What happened was not only did CBS pull its programming from Charter's cable service,"
18:59;19:06;"it blocked its content from Charter's internet customers."
19:06;19:15;"So yes, something like that could very well happen where there's a dispute on the cable side"
19:15;19:18;"or even a dispute about something else."
19:18;19:22;"And the internet service provider could block content from a content provider."
19:22;19:25;"Yes, net neutrality protects against that."
19:25;19:30;"But look, your analogy is perfect. Without net neutrality,"
19:30;19:35;"internet service is likely to become a lot more like cable,"
19:35;19:40;"where the cable operator picks and chooses who gets on the best tiers,"
19:40;19:43;"who gets the best channel, and frankly, who gets on it all."
19:43;19:47;"So that could be on some vigilante justice."
19:47;19:51;"James Dolan or somebody who owns one of these big communications companies"
19:51;19:54;"could maybe even just make personal calls."
19:54;20:00;"That's kind of like, ""You know what? Everybody who voted for Bernie Sanders,"
20:00;20:03;"you're not using Comcast anymore."
20:03;20:08;"We've seen what you're Googling. We don't need any more of that third-party fake Democrat nonsense."
20:08;20:09;"You're out of here."""
20:09;20:14;"Well, the fact that your internet service provider sees every single thing you do online,"
20:14;20:16;"that's a whole other kettle of fish."
20:16;20:22;"When I was at the FCC, we passed really strong broadband privacy rules"
20:22;20:27;"that gave the consumer the ability to tell its internet service provider"
20:27;20:29;"that it could not collect sensitive information."
20:29;20:31;"And you know what happened?"
20:31;20:32;"What?"
20:32;20:37;"CMS repealed it last March, and people are still infuriated about it."
20:37;20:41;"So not only is these internet companies, with no net neutrality,"
20:41;20:46;"potentially going to be able to change the speed, pick winners, pick losers,"
20:46;20:48;"affect our ability to be free on the internet,"
20:48;20:51;"they're already compromising our privacy."
20:51;20:54;"Yep. And this is important."
20:54;20:57;"Let me just tell you why I raised the privacy issue."
20:57;21:03;"Because the net neutrality debate that's going on right now is about much more than blocking"
21:03;21:07;"and throttling and fast lanes, fast and slow lanes."
21:07;21:13;"It's also about whether there will be any government entity protecting consumers"
21:13;21:19;"in competition when it comes to access to the most important network of our time."
21:19;21:24;"Now, the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, which I worked for for a number of years,"
21:24;21:27;"was set up in 1934 to do just that, right?"
21:27;21:33;"To oversee broadcast networks and cable networks and telephone networks and broadband networks."
21:33;21:37;"But as he is moving to repeal net neutrality,"
21:37;21:43;"the FCC chair, Rajit Pai, also wants to strip the FCC of any and all power"
21:43;21:45;"to protect consumers and competition."
21:45;21:47;"So what do I mean?"
21:47;21:50;"Well, let's say--so where are you located? Are you in New York?"
21:50;21:51;"We're in L.A. right now."
21:51;21:54;"We're in L.A., okay. So you have Charter, right?"
21:54;21:58;"Isn't that your main Internet service provider?"
21:58;21:59;"Time Warner."
21:59;22:01;"Yeah, Time Warner's big out here."
22:01;22:03;"Well, Charter owns Time Warner."
22:03;22:04;"Oh, okay, got it."
22:04;22:07;"It's gotten very consolidated. That's a whole 'nother conversation."
22:07;22:09;"Brutal. Nice, good for them."
22:09;22:13;"Yeah, so let's say one day Charter decides to double its prices."
22:13;22:18;"Just because. Because it's a regional monopoly. It doesn't have a whole lot of competition."
22:18;22:24;"If the FCC is stripped of oversight of broadband, they can't do a darn thing about it."
22:24;22:25;"Imagine that."
22:25;22:31;"So what's the philosophy behind the current administration's vision?"
22:31;22:34;"Like, what are they thinking in terms of their best-case scenario?"
22:34;22:39;"They think less regulation is better, and the bigger should get bigger and more powerful."
22:39;22:40;"That's really what it is."
22:40;22:44;"I mean, I'm not going to bore your listeners with every single thing"
22:44;22:47;"that this chairman has done over the past 10 months."
22:47;22:53;"But pretty much every single thing has allowed large, powerful media companies"
22:53;22:56;"to get more large and more powerful."
22:56;23:00;"So in your opinion, bad news?"
23:00;23:03;"Yeah, well, look, I'm invested in it."
23:03;23:07;"I was at the FCC under Tom Wheeler. I worked for him."
23:07;23:10;"We passed the strongest-ever net neutrality rules."
23:10;23:13;"We passed the strongest-ever privacy rules."
23:13;23:20;"We made sure that poor people and people in rural areas got more broadband."
23:20;23:27;"We raised the standard for broadband so consumers weren't left with slow, crummy broadband."
23:27;23:31;"And he's reversing pretty much every single one of those things."
23:31;23:32;"Good Lord."
23:32;23:37;"If I could tell your listeners, there are things you can do."
23:37;23:40;"I think it's highly unlikely that we're going to stop this vote,"
23:40;23:46;"although I still think it's important for people to let their members of Congress know that they're unhappy."
23:46;23:53;"There's a website called Battle for the Net, where you just put in your name and your address, and voila."
23:53;23:59;"You can contact your senator and members of Congress and let them know how unhappy you are."
23:59;24:00;"I highly recommend doing that."
24:00;24:06;"But I think even more importantly is people have to go out and vote in 2018."
24:06;24:12;"And this ought to be one of the issues that you ask people who are running for office where you live."
24:12;24:16;"Do you support strong net neutrality?"
24:16;24:18;"And if they don't, you shouldn't vote for them."
24:18;24:24;"I hope and actually believe, because broadband is so darn important to people's lives now,"
24:24;24:27;"that they will vote on these kind of issues."
24:27;24:34;"Well, yeah, let's hope the Democrats can figure out how to turn it into a simple issue."
24:34;24:36;"Yeah, well, it's hard, right?"
24:36;24:40;"I mean, that's why I think it's important to compare it to cable."
24:40;24:42;"Do you like your cable operator?"
24:42;24:48;"If you like your cable operator and your cable service, then you're going to love life without net neutrality."
24:48;24:50;"It's really that simple."
24:50;24:57;"If you like controlling what you do on the Internet and don't want anybody coming in between you and that choice,"
24:57;25:00;"then you're pro net neutrality."
25:00;25:05;"Well, thanks so much, Gigi. It's been great talking to you, and you really elucidated these topics for us."
25:05;25:07;"And again, we appreciate you fighting the good fight."
25:07;25:10;"Well, any time. I'm happy to come on."
25:10;25:13;"I know a lot more than just about net neutrality."
25:13;25:19;"Anything having to do with networks, I'd love to come back and talk about them again."
25:19;25:21;"Love to talk to you again. Have a good one."
25:21;25:22;"Take care now."
25:22;25:23;"All right, bye."
25:23;25:24;"Bye."
28:34;28:38;"Big thanks to Gigi Son for taking the time to educate us on net neutrality."
28:38;28:42;"So what do you think, Jake? Are you pro net neutrality or anti?"
28:42;28:43;"I'm pro."
28:43;28:44;"Really?"
28:44;28:46;"Is that a contentious statement?"
28:46;28:48;"No, that seems like the right thing. I mean, if you're going to have--"
28:48;28:51;"I was hoping that Gigi Son would be like, ""You know what? I worked at the FCC for a long time."""
28:51;28:53;"It's all BS."
28:53;28:55;"We got to destroy the internet."
28:55;28:57;"I was hoping she'd say-- I'd be like, ""I could get behind that."""
28:57;29:02;"But it's one of those things. It's like if there's going to be the internet, it might as well be free and open."
29:02;29:04;"Seems like a no-brainer."
29:04;29:07;"I would be into destroying the internet, but yeah, this doesn't work."
29:07;29:10;"Going back to the mid-90s? Sounds good to me."
29:10;29:14;"Anyway, we're now joined by a friend of the show, Kazzy David."
29:14;29:15;"Welcome back."
29:15;29:17;"Thank you for having me."
29:17;29:18;"Glad to have you back."
29:18;29:25;"You know, it's been a long time, and we've been criticized for this, since Time Crisis has had a female voice on the show."
29:25;29:27;"Today we have two."
29:27;29:29;"Was I the first? There's no way."
29:29;29:31;"Oh, ever on the show? No, no."
29:31;29:37;"And here's the thing. Maybe this is a cop-out, but I feel like generally Time Crisis has had less and less guests."
29:37;29:38;"Yep."
29:38;29:41;"And so boiled down with no guests--"
29:41;29:42;"It's real one-on-one."
29:42;29:46;"It's de facto two cis men."
29:46;29:48;"That is what the show--"
29:48;29:50;"Middle-aged."
29:50;29:53;"Wow, actually, when does middle-age start?"
29:53;29:55;"I'm middle-aged at this point."
29:55;29:56;"Once you hit 40?"
29:56;29:57;"38."
29:57;29:58;"Oh, really?"
29:58;29:59;"I don't know."
29:59;30:01;"I guess it depends on how long you live."
30:01;30:02;"Yeah."
30:02;30:03;"Oh, right."
30:03;30:07;"Well, if you lived to about 76, 38 would be smack dab in the mid."
30:07;30:09;"Okay, so I'm approaching middle-age now."
30:09;30:16;"But anyway, it's important to have more female voices on the show because we don't talk about gendered things really on the show."
30:16;30:18;"They shouldn't be at least."
30:18;30:20;"Tasteful palette of 70s rock, Home Depot."
30:20;30:22;"I guess those things are a little bit gendered."
30:22;30:24;"We're trying to stop that."
30:24;30:26;"Yeah, no one's going to argue with that."
30:26;30:29;"Anyway, we got to talk about Thanksgiving, guys."
30:29;30:30;"Yeah."
30:30;30:35;"We talked a little bit about how my family was in town for Thanksgiving, but what did you do, Kazzy?"
30:35;30:41;"I went with my dad and we visited his brother and his family who we haven't seen in a long time."
30:41;30:42;"Like years?"
30:42;30:45;"I haven't seen them in like, yeah, five, six years."
30:45;30:46;"Where do they live?"
30:46;30:48;"They live in San Diego."
30:48;30:49;"Really?"
30:49;30:55;"We just popped down for like three hours and got out of there pretty much as quick as we could."
30:55;30:57;"Shots fired."
30:57;30:58;"That would be a bummer."
30:58;31:01;"So it's like a three-hour drive down there."
31:01;31:02;"Yeah."
31:02;31:03;"Then you're there for three."
31:03;31:06;"Have they been watching the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm?"
31:06;31:09;"Like no one's said anything, so maybe not."
31:09;31:11;"This is like an episode of Curb-- it didn't come up?"
31:11;31:12;"It did not come up."
31:12;31:13;"That's amazing."
31:13;31:15;"No showbiz talk whatsoever?"
31:15;31:18;"There was like, ""Did you see that movie?"""
31:18;31:19;"""Yeah, what'd you think?"""
31:19;31:21;"Like, ""Good, yeah, what'd you think?"""
31:21;31:23;"Had they seen your web series?"
31:23;31:24;"No."
31:24;31:25;"Did they ask about it?"
31:25;31:26;"No."
31:26;31:27;"What did they at least say?"
31:27;31:28;"""So what have you been up to?"""
31:28;31:29;"Yeah, they did."
31:29;31:30;"And I said, ""You know."""
31:31;31:33;"Wait, so when they're catching up with your dad,"
31:33;31:36;"there's not some conversation that's like,"
31:36;31:38;"""So what have you been up to, Larry?"""
31:38;31:42;"And he's like, ""Well, the new season of my show has been on TV."""
31:42;31:46;"Yeah, that's exactly how it happened, and then I don't--"
31:46;31:47;"there's no responses."
31:47;31:48;"No, I mean, yeah."
31:48;31:50;"We were asking most of the questions."
31:50;31:52;"Maybe they don't want to have all the showbiz talk."
31:52;31:54;"They want to get into the real stuff."
31:54;31:55;"Yeah, that's probably it."
31:55;31:58;"And this is a traditional Thanksgiving dinner?"
31:58;32:01;"I mean, it was at 2.30, so I don't--"
32:01;32:03;"You know, that's another question that I've had."
32:03;32:04;"Yeah, that's weird."
32:04;32:07;"I did not like the 2.30 dinner."
32:07;32:10;"When did your family have Thanksgiving?"
32:10;32:12;"Usually more of like a four."
32:12;32:13;"Okay, so still afternoon."
32:13;32:15;"This year we did noon."
32:15;32:16;"Whoa."
32:16;32:17;"So it was fully a lunch."
32:17;32:18;"It was a lunch."
32:18;32:19;"Okay."
32:19;32:21;"That's like a breakfast almost."
32:21;32:26;"We ate at the Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, Massachusetts,"
32:26;32:29;"we were out there with Hannah, and we were with her parents"
32:29;32:33;"and her aunt and uncle, six of us in total,"
32:33;32:36;"and we were late in booking a reservation at the Red Lion,"
32:36;32:39;"so all that was left was a noon seating."
32:39;32:40;"Oh."
32:40;32:44;"Because people book out, you know, eight, ten months in advance."
32:44;32:45;"Maybe it's better that way."
32:45;32:46;"I liked it."
32:46;32:47;"Yeah, eat early."
32:47;32:52;"We got up, half a bagel, coffee at like 8 o'clock."
32:52;32:53;"Yeah."
32:53;32:54;"Then by noon--"
32:54;32:55;"Thanksgiving."
32:55;33:00;"--sat down, had like a small glass of wine at noon,"
33:00;33:02;"a little early in the day, but went for it."
33:02;33:06;"Great meal, and then went and saw Lady Bird at like 4."
33:06;33:08;"And then you're walking on air."
33:08;33:09;"Walking on air the rest of the day."
33:09;33:11;"You saw a great film."
33:11;33:12;"Yeah."
33:12;33:13;"Best ever Rotten Tomatoes review."
33:13;33:14;"You're just walking on air."
33:14;33:15;"Yeah."
33:15;33:16;"Late dinner."
33:16;33:17;"Yeah."
33:17;33:18;"Late dinner, hit the sack?"
33:18;33:19;"Yep."
33:19;33:21;"Love it."
33:21;33:23;"Noon."
33:23;33:24;"2.30 is awkward."
33:24;33:27;"Well, and also it was so warm in Southern California."
33:27;33:28;"Heard that."
33:28;33:32;"Yeah, being at kind of like a slow 2.30 p.m. Thanksgiving lunch."
33:32;33:34;"Then driving back three hours?"
33:34;33:40;"Just that San Diego sun burning through the shades."
33:40;33:42;"It's not what the pilgrims intended."
33:42;33:43;"What time did you eat, Ezra?"
33:43;33:45;"It was a straight-up dinner."
33:45;33:48;"Probably 8 p.m."
33:48;33:49;"Wow."
33:49;33:50;"Yeah."
33:50;33:51;"Strong."
33:51;33:52;"It was a real dinner."
33:52;33:53;"So we were here."
33:53;33:56;"My parents came out here, and we did Thanksgiving with Rashida's family."
33:56;33:58;"And they do more of a proper dinner."
33:58;34:00;"I think it was like us on the East Coast."
34:00;34:02;"We'd be doing it at 3 p.m."
34:02;34:03;"Right."
34:03;34:05;"But it was like a real dinner."
34:05;34:08;"You know, we were at somebody else's house, so it was like a big one."
34:08;34:09;"There were a lot of people there."
34:09;34:10;"But it was a nice vibe."
34:10;34:12;"And did you cook at all?"
34:12;34:13;"No."
34:13;34:14;"You make some like Brussels sprouts or anything?"
34:14;34:15;"No."
34:16;34:17;"Nothing."
34:17;34:19;"This was like a huge Thanksgiving dinner, so it was like buffet style."
34:19;34:24;"Not the type of thing you're just going to roll up with Brussels sprouts to."
34:24;34:27;"Did everyone help make it, or it was like catered?"
34:27;34:29;"Yeah, it was like more or less catered."
34:29;34:31;"More or less."
34:31;34:32;"I think, you know what?"
34:32;34:35;"Maybe like low-key, the thing to do with Thanksgiving is you have to be involved in the cooking."
34:35;34:37;"It does give it more meaning."
34:37;34:38;"That's for sure."
34:38;34:39;"Yeah."
34:39;34:40;"Next year."
34:41;34:42;"That's right."
34:42;34:43;"I'm going to be a chef."
34:43;34:44;"I think I'm going to be a chef."
34:44;34:45;"You're going to be a chef."
34:45;34:46;"I'm going to be a chef."
35:02;35:30;"I'm going to be a chef."
35:30;35:51;"I'm going to be a chef."
35:51;36:19;"I'm going to be a chef."
36:19;36:48;"I'm going to be a chef."
36:48;36:49;"I'm going to be a chef."
37:11;37:13;"This could be the last time."
37:13;37:16;"Maybe the last time."
37:16;37:19;"I don't know."
37:19;37:21;"Anyway, do you guys care about the Grammys?"
37:21;37:22;"Deeply."
37:22;37:25;"Were you even aware that the Grammy nominations came out?"
37:25;37:26;"No."
37:26;37:27;"This past week?"
37:27;37:28;"Yeah, I looked at them."
37:28;37:32;"Because what, you woke up and you had a phone full of texts?"
37:32;37:33;"I just like--"
37:33;37:34;"Kazzy, did you see?"
37:34;37:35;"Healthy haul."
37:35;37:37;"No, I look at the news every morning."
37:37;37:41;"But it's like sick, to the point where it's not healthy."
37:41;37:47;"So I look at just every single piece of news I missed since I fell asleep."
37:47;37:50;"And do you think that helps you--"
37:50;37:53;"does that put a pep in your step when you started the day?"
37:53;37:54;"No, I think it's awful."
37:54;37:57;"But I did see all the Grammy noms, of course."
37:57;37:58;"OK."
37:58;38:02;"I saw people were very excited that this is apparently the first year"
38:02;38:08;"that none of the artists nominated for album of the year are white men."
38:08;38:09;"Oh, I didn't know that."
38:09;38:10;"You didn't know that?"
38:10;38:11;"That was like the big headline."
38:11;38:13;"I did not see that headline."
38:13;38:19;"There was a year in the late '90s when everybody nominated was female,"
38:19;38:23;"but that included the band Garbage, which has a female singer,"
38:23;38:26;"but still some white men in the band."
38:26;38:27;"Butch Vig."
38:28;38:31;"But I'm always a bit of a contrarian."
38:31;38:33;"Garbage was nominated for album of the year?"
38:33;38:34;"Yes."
38:34;38:37;"They lost to Lauryn Hill."
38:37;38:39;"That sounds about right."
38:39;38:43;"I think Garbage is a good band."
38:43;38:44;"Anyway."
38:44;38:45;"It's neither here nor there."
38:45;38:47;"Let's start with album of the year."
38:47;38:53;"This year the nominees are Childish Gambino, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar,"
38:53;38:56;"Lorde, and Bruno Mars."
38:56;38:59;"I hate to be a contrarian, but maybe just because I'm a music industry insider,"
38:59;39:01;"the first thing that I thought of was, you know what?"
39:01;39:04;"There's a lot of white men producers on some of those albums."
39:04;39:07;"Is it?"
39:07;39:08;"Yeah."
39:08;39:11;"Can you name the producers of all those records just off the top of your head"
39:11;39:12;"going down?"
39:12;39:13;"Well, now I'm looking at it."
39:13;39:14;"No, but I know--"
39:14;39:15;"Then we're getting really picky."
39:15;39:16;"No, no."
39:16;39:19;"I know Ludwig, who works with Donald on Childish Gambino."
39:19;39:20;"Okay."
39:20;39:23;"I know the Jay-Z album is produced by No I.D."
39:23;39:26;"Kendrick Lamar, I know DJ Da, he worked on that, among others."
39:26;39:31;"I know the Lorde album is produced by Jack Antonoff, and the Bruno Mars album,"
39:31;39:33;"I didn't know who produced it, but it was basically him."
39:33;39:35;"Oh, Bruno self-produced."
39:35;39:37;"Well, it's credited to Shampoo, Press, and Curl."
39:40;39:43;"Which I think is really just him and maybe some other people."
39:43;39:45;"Well, so anyway, what do we think?"
39:45;39:47;"Is that a healthy haul?"
39:47;39:49;"Have you heard any of these albums?"
39:49;39:50;"I've heard the Bruno record."
39:50;39:52;"You've heard the whole Bruno record?"
39:52;39:53;"Yep, in a rental car."
39:53;39:55;"Listen to a full Bruno record."
39:55;39:56;"What was the situation?"
39:56;39:58;"My wife and I did."
39:58;40:00;"We were in D.C. for a wedding."
40:00;40:01;"Yeah."
40:01;40:02;"We were driving around."
40:02;40:03;"I don't know how it came up."
40:03;40:05;"We just threw it on."
40:05;40:07;"I would say we probably got to track eight or nine."
40:07;40:08;"Interesting."
40:08;40:11;"Some of the deep cuts hold up."
40:11;40:12;"I got a confession to make."
40:12;40:13;"Yeah?"
40:13;40:16;"This is the first year that I voted for the Grammy nominations."
40:16;40:18;"Oh, I blew it."
40:18;40:19;"Oh, you forgot to register."
40:19;40:20;"Remember?"
40:20;40:21;"I was supposed to register."
40:21;40:22;"Ah, yeah."
40:22;40:23;"See, that's the thing."
40:23;40:27;"Every year the Grammys come up and there's always a conversation that's about race and"
40:27;40:28;"who's voting."
40:28;40:29;"Right."
40:29;40:34;"And the truth is with the Grammys, the Grammys can truly be baffling sometimes."
40:34;40:38;"Like, obviously, there are a lot of old white dudes voting for the Grammys, but it's like"
40:38;40:41;"it doesn't always shake out the way that you think it's going to."
40:41;40:43;"Well, how does it work with nominations?"
40:43;40:44;"So with nominations--"
40:44;40:47;"Who did you vote for is the better question."
40:47;40:48;"I want to talk about this."
40:48;40:50;"We're building to that."
40:50;40:55;"So with nominations, I'd never voted in nominations before, sometimes because I would just miss"
40:55;40:57;"the registration."
40:57;40:59;"It's so annoying that you have to register."
40:59;41:03;"Like, you would think that if you're somebody who's got a few album credits, you could just"
41:03;41:05;"be on the rolls for a while."
41:05;41:06;"Right."
41:06;41:08;"It's hard enough to register for the election."
41:08;41:09;"Yes, seriously."
41:09;41:10;"I can't imagine."
41:10;41:11;"So I think it should just be easy."
41:11;41:12;"And I guess they're trying to make it easy."
41:12;41:15;"You have to pay $100, which I think is kind of lame, too."
41:15;41:16;"Yep."
41:16;41:17;"Like, they're taking in--"
41:17;41:18;"Is that every year?"
41:18;41:19;"I don't want to time it."
41:19;41:21;"Every year, you have to pay $100."
41:21;41:25;"And I think they have something that, like, for the younger people, that maybe they waive"
41:25;41:26;"the fee."
41:26;41:28;"Anyway, so you basically-- you log on to a website."
41:28;41:30;"It's a little convoluted."
41:30;41:31;"And then you vote."
41:31;41:38;"And just so everybody knows, before-- so this is when music industry insiders like me get"
41:38;41:41;"to throw our hat into the ring and say who we think should be nominated."
41:41;41:45;"But there was a process before this that I was not privy to."
41:45;41:49;"So, like, for instance-- and some Grammy person might get mad and say that I'm describing"
41:49;41:50;"this incorrectly."
41:50;41:51;"But this is my take."
41:51;41:52;"This is what I understand it to be."
41:52;41:54;"There's committees for each category."
41:54;41:56;"I know people who serve on various committees."
41:56;41:59;"Like, I got a friend who served on the electronic committee."
41:59;42:02;"That committee decides who's even eligible to be nominated, because obviously this is"
42:02;42:06;"somewhat subjective about what can be nominated for this and that."
42:06;42:14;"So, like, infamously, there was a year-- I've heard these stories-- that the committee that's"
42:14;42:17;"in charge of who can be nominated for best alternative album gets together."
42:17;42:21;"So it's a lot of guys who work at record labels, maybe a few musicians."
42:21;42:24;"I think it's predominantly, like, people who work at labels."
42:24;42:31;"And somebody that year was saying, well, the Shins should be eligible for best alternative."
42:31;42:33;"And somebody else said, I don't think so."
42:33;42:34;"This is, like, on their third or fourth album."
42:34;42:36;"They're like, Shins are too big now."
42:36;42:37;"They're not alternative anymore."
42:37;42:39;"And the guy's like, well, clearly they're still alternative."
42:39;42:42;"They're no bigger than, like, Radiohead or these bands."
42:42;42:46;"Their music still is-- even if it's gotten a little poppier, it's still in the lineage"
42:46;42:47;"of alternative rock."
42:47;42:48;"The genre is-- yeah."
42:48;42:50;"And somebody's like, no, they should either be in pop or rock."
42:50;42:51;"And they put their foot down."
42:51;42:56;"So keep in mind, these are people who have vested interests in terms of who should be."
42:56;43:01;"So for instance, let's imagine there's a dude from Vampire Weekend's record label serving"
43:01;43:02;"on the committee."
43:02;43:05;"And he knows it's a big year for Vampire Weekend."
43:05;43:07;"We got that great alternative sound."
43:07;43:08;"But he's a little nervous."
43:08;43:10;"He doesn't want too much competition in the category."
43:10;43:13;"So he comes in and says, can we agree Vampire Weekend's alternative?"
43:13;43:14;"Everybody says yes."
43:14;43:18;"And then another guy comes and says, can we agree that Dirty Projectors is alternative?"
43:18;43:20;"And my guy says, you know what?"
43:20;43:22;"Dirty Projectors is hip hop."
43:22;43:23;"It's their ninth album."
43:23;43:24;"Hear me out."
43:24;43:25;"Hear me--"
43:25;43:29;"Dave Longstreth, he's out there producing Solange."
43:29;43:31;"It's R&B or hip hop."
43:31;43:33;"And then imagine a few other guys are like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
43:33;43:34;"I agree."
43:34;43:38;"Next thing you know, Dave can't be nominated for best alternative album."
43:38;43:39;"He's screwed."
43:40;43:43;"And then he's not going to get the best R&B album nomination."
43:43;43:44;"Well--"
43:44;43:46;"OK, so anyway, just that's how it works."
43:46;43:48;"A group of people get together and make these decisions."
43:48;43:55;"So by the time I'm logging on to the Grammys portal, there have already been some strings pulled."
43:55;43:57;"So it's slightly corrupt."
43:57;43:58;"It's a little corrupt."
43:58;43:59;"So--"
43:59;44:00;"It's like the DNC."
44:00;44:03;"But it's like all those award ceremonies, like you have to kiss their ass too."
44:03;44:05;"Like it's not actually--"
44:05;44:06;"Well, it can be."
44:06;44:11;"That's why sometimes I get confused because sometimes I talk to people who get nominated for something and they're just like--"
44:11;44:13;"I'm like, were you like campaigning for it?"
44:13;44:14;"And they're like, no, it's random."
44:14;44:15;"So you don't know."
44:15;44:24;"But one thing I noticed is that the way the website loads, you have to click the four or five things that you want to pick to be nominated for a category."
44:24;44:27;"But in some of these categories, it's like 1,000 things are in there."
44:27;44:35;"So I also had this feeling like if your song or your name is going to be down towards the bottom, you might just miss out on a few clicks just because this thing loads so slowly."
44:35;44:39;"Like you would think that you'd be able to log in and just type in who you want to vote for."
44:39;44:42;"But instead, you have to like let this whole thing load and like scroll down and click."
44:42;44:43;"I don't remember everything."
44:43;44:44;"I hate this."
44:44;44:45;"Yeah, it's annoying."
44:45;44:46;"But whatever."
44:46;44:47;"I'm sure-- I don't know what it used to be like."
44:47;44:51;"I'm sure some people would say that this is a way better way of doing things that you can log on online and whatever."
44:51;44:54;"So you're working on the nominating process."
44:54;44:57;"There was like 1,000 records."
44:57;45:01;"Well, for some categories, like you click on Best New Artist and there might be 500 people."
45:01;45:03;"You click on Album of the Year."
45:03;45:04;"What the hell?"
45:04;45:08;"There's like 1,000 things, and I'm going through clicking and like something catches my eye, you know?"
45:08;45:12;"So then you can click five different nominees or you can click 20 or--"
45:12;45:16;"You can click five different nominees from the pre-approved mega list."
45:16;45:18;"Sheermag?"
45:18;45:20;"Oh, and I forgot to vote for Sheermag."
45:20;45:21;"Dude."
47:34;47:37;"Okay, here's what I remember."
47:37;47:44;"I definitely remember that I put Kendrick for Album of the Year, and that's who I tend to vote for in the general election."
47:44;47:46;"Stating it publicly."
47:46;47:48;"I wonder if that's against the rules."
47:48;47:49;"It's so hilarious."
47:49;47:50;"I've said this before."
47:50;47:51;"Pitchfork story."
47:51;47:54;"Ezra Koenig disqualified."
47:54;47:56;"Banned from the Grammys."
47:56;47:57;"It's so hilarious that--"
47:57;47:59;"White man, Ezra Koenig."
47:59;48:00;"Right."
48:00;48:01;"One less white man on that."
48:01;48:05;"Okay, well, at least there's that."
48:05;48:06;"I just think that the Kendrick album--"
48:06;48:07;"I think all those--"
48:07;48:12;"There's a lot of strong contenders in the Album of the Year, but Kendrick has lost before."
48:12;48:16;"They don't give Album of the Year enough to hip-hop, which is crazy."
48:16;48:19;"They got a real bad track record when it comes to hip-hop."
48:19;48:21;"And it's Kendrick's time."
48:21;48:23;"Who did he lose to before?"
48:23;48:24;"Was it Mumford?"
48:24;48:26;"Oh, that's rough."
48:26;48:27;"Can we get a fact check on that?"
48:27;48:29;"Wait, sorry, who are the nominees again?"
48:29;48:33;"Kendrick, Bruno, Lorde, Childish Gambino."
48:33;48:34;"Okay."
48:34;48:36;"Who won the last year, Album of the Year?"
48:36;48:37;"Last year was Adele."
48:37;48:38;"Oh, right."
48:38;48:39;"Which cost me a Grammy."
48:39;48:41;"Adele versus Beyonce."
48:41;48:43;"Yeah, I would have won that Beyonce Grammy."
48:43;48:44;"I lost it."
48:44;48:48;"Remember when Adele was doing that George Michael song, and he started in the wrong key?"
48:48;48:49;"That was so crazy."
48:49;48:51;"And then she was like, ""We gotta start over."""
48:51;48:52;"Good for her."
48:52;48:53;"I know, I felt terrible for her."
48:53;48:56;"I was like, ""That'd be so hard to be like, 'Guys, guys, guys.'"""
48:56;48:57;"She got praised for that."
48:57;48:58;"Yeah."
48:58;48:59;"I remember that."
48:59;49:00;"Oh, no, okay, sorry."
49:00;49:01;"Kendrick lost to Daft Punk."
49:01;49:02;"Oh, okay."
49:02;49:04;"You're voting for Kendrick."
49:04;49:05;"Is that your prediction?"
49:05;49:06;"You know what?"
49:06;49:13;"I am a little nervous, and other people have said this, that the hip hop vote may get split."
49:13;49:14;"Oh."
49:14;49:15;"Because-"
49:15;49:19;"Those damn Green Party people."
49:19;49:20;"Yeah, exactly."
49:20;49:26;"In this instance, Kendrick is Hillary, the person that the coastal elites think deserves"
49:26;49:27;"it."
49:27;49:28;"Jay-Z is Trump."
49:28;49:29;"No, no, no."
49:29;49:30;"I'm just-"
49:30;49:33;"Actually, I don't want to call anybody Trump."
49:33;49:37;"Let's just say that the two major parties here would probably be..."
49:37;49:40;"Well, see, here's the thing."
49:40;49:51;"As much as some people are excited that there's no white men in the album of the year, sometimes"
49:51;49:54;"a dopey white guy can serve as a good buffer."
49:54;49:56;"Just a non-entity."
49:56;49:57;"Just norm from Cheers."
49:57;49:58;"Right."
49:58;49:59;"You know what I mean?"
49:59;50:00;"So you're not splitting the vote."
50:00;50:05;"So this year, I think a lot of people want to see Kendrick win."
50:05;50:12;"And no disrespect to Lorde, but if we're really talking about righting a historical wrong,"
50:12;50:17;"which is the way in which white people have profited off black music in this country time"
50:17;50:23;"and time again, we want to honor black music, which is very important in this country."
50:23;50:29;"It would be a shame if in the year that finally you got rid of..."
50:29;50:31;"The white guys had a year where they took a backseat."
50:31;50:37;"If it goes to the one white person out of the five, I don't know."
50:37;50:39;"No woman points for her."
50:39;50:40;"Well, what do you think?"
50:40;50:41;"You're a Caucasian female."
50:41;50:45;"I mean, I just think her album's so..."
50:45;50:47;"It was so good."
50:47;50:48;"I love Melodrama."
50:48;50:50;"I thought it was like..."
50:50;50:51;"To me, it was the best album of the year."
50:51;50:53;"You thought it was better than Kendrick."
50:53;50:54;"Yeah."
50:54;50:58;"Well, it's so subjective anyway, but I'm just talking in terms of a feel-good story."
50:58;51:00;"I mean, I think they can both be feel-good."
51:00;51:04;"I mean, she'll have many more chances, that's true."
51:04;51:06;"She's so young."
51:06;51:08;"But I don't know."
51:08;51:11;"I just think that's also a feel-good story."
51:11;51:18;"I would have to judge them all based on just the work alone and not the story, you know?"
51:18;51:20;"Not based on the color of their skin."
51:20;51:22;"Jay-Z admitted to cheating."
51:22;51:23;"On the Grammys?"
51:23;51:24;"Yeah, on his album."
51:24;51:25;"Oh."
51:25;51:26;"Cheating on his album?"
51:26;51:27;"What do you mean?"
51:27;51:32;"Well, it was the whole thing about how he revealed that he cheated on Beyonce and that"
51:32;51:33;"was the big..."
51:33;51:34;"Oh, cheated on his wife."
51:34;51:35;"I thought you meant..."
51:35;51:38;"Sorry, I missed that completely."
51:38;51:39;"Maybe that was part of Jay-Z's Grammy campaign."
51:39;51:41;"Start up some drama."
51:41;51:43;"It's just like when you're running for office, sometimes you got to get some shit out of"
51:43;51:44;"the way."
51:44;51:45;"Well, I'm pushing for Bruno."
51:45;51:46;"Pushing for..."
51:46;51:47;"Oh my God."
51:47;51:52;"I thought there was going to be mass consensus that this is Kendrick's year."
51:52;51:55;"Kendrick 100% above Bruno."
51:55;52:01;"I'm not saying that I have the same glee that there's no white men in album of the year."
52:01;52:03;"I'm with it though."
52:03;52:05;"You know, there should be some..."
52:05;52:09;"I can't think of a white guy that's like, you know, should be on that list."
52:09;52:10;"Okay, but I'm just trying to go..."
52:10;52:11;"Besides Sheermag."
52:11;52:12;"I think it's all..."
52:12;52:14;"Which is fronted by a woman."
52:14;52:15;"Okay, look."
52:15;52:16;"I think it's all..."
52:16;52:17;"I think all of this is nonsense."
52:17;52:20;"Look, I think all the Grammys are nonsense."
52:20;52:27;"Although it feels good to win one as a Grammy winner, but it also feels bad to lose one"
52:27;52:28;"as a Grammy loser."
52:28;52:29;"That'd be a cool speech."
52:29;52:30;"Grammys are nonsense."
52:30;52:35;"No, the Bon Iver kind of did that once and everybody was like, ""Oh, shut up."
52:35;52:36;"Stay home then."""
52:36;52:37;"Right."
52:37;52:38;"And they're kind of right."
52:38;52:41;"He's kind of like the Jonathan Franzen gone, you know, like an Oprah being like, ""I don't"
52:41;52:43;"want to be part of your book club."""
52:43;52:45;"Honestly, your book club sucks."
52:45;52:46;"Yeah, no."
52:46;52:49;"It's like if you show up, be like a polite guest at least."
52:49;52:50;"Fair enough."
52:50;52:51;"Yeah."
52:51;52:56;"But I saw on the internet that people were excited that there were no white men nominated"
52:56;52:57;"this year."
52:57;52:59;"We've got bad white men in the White House."
52:59;53:01;"I understand why people feel that way."
53:01;53:02;"They want to see fine..."
53:02;53:03;"You know, for once."
53:03;53:04;"Yeah, but okay."
53:04;53:05;"Okay, I don't want to..."
53:05;53:06;"That's ridiculous."
53:06;53:07;"Okay."
53:07;53:08;"The White House?"
53:08;53:10;"Here's what I like."
53:10;53:13;"I like intellectual consistency."
53:13;53:14;"You know what I'm saying?"
53:14;53:15;"Yeah."
53:15;53:20;"So, if you think white guys are whack and shouldn't be winning so many albums of the"
53:20;53:21;"year..."
53:21;53:22;"Across the board."
53:22;53:23;"Yeah."
53:23;53:29;"Okay, but I'm just saying that the Kendrick and the Jay-Z album have the least number"
53:29;53:31;"of white guys working on the album."
53:31;53:33;"So, I'm just saying, if you really want to be..."
53:33;53:35;"I don't like politics."
53:35;53:40;"I don't like when somebody says something like, ""Finally, no white male artists,"" and then"
53:40;53:43;"don't look under the hood and say, ""We got some white guys hiding in there too."""
53:43;53:48;"So, I'm just saying, again, I'm not toying the anti-white male line."
53:48;53:53;"You know I love Van Morrison, Bob Dylan."
53:53;53:54;"I'm just..."
53:54;53:55;"Bruce Springsteen."
53:56;53:57;"All I'm saying, though, is like..."
53:57;53:58;"I hear ya."
53:58;53:59;"If this is..."
53:59;54:01;"And look, there's got to be themes every year."
54:01;54:04;"If this is the year that's like, white guys take a back seat, that's fine."
54:04;54:05;"Come on."
54:05;54:07;"White guys are taking the front seat so much."
54:07;54:10;"But I'm just saying, let's do it right then."
54:10;54:11;"Go all the way."
54:11;54:12;"Because here's the thing."
54:12;54:14;"If some of these albums win..."
54:14;54:16;"I actually wrestled with this last time with the Beyonce album."
54:16;54:21;"A very powerful album about Beyonce's experiences as a black woman in America."
54:21;54:23;"Me and Diplo were talking about it up to the last minute."
54:23;54:24;"Oh, yeah."
54:24;54:25;"Our R2."
54:25;54:28;"Do me and Diplo really want to be standing behind her when she..."
54:28;54:29;"Do you bum rush the stage?"
54:29;54:30;"I don't know."
54:30;54:31;"Yeah, I'm glad we didn't bum rush the stage."
54:31;54:37;"But anyway, if this is the year that people are excited that it's about recognizing talent,"
54:37;54:41;"that white guys don't have to be part of every little thing, if that's how some people feel,"
54:41;54:43;"then let's do it right."
54:43;54:44;"Bruno."
54:44;54:52;"If the theme of the prom is enchantment under the sea, let's have shrimp cocktail."
54:52;54:54;"Don't order pizza because it's tasty."
54:54;54:55;"You know what I'm saying?"
54:55;54:59;"Let's say it is about the pure talent of each artist."
54:59;55:00;"No such thing."
55:00;55:07;"There's like 10 producers on every single one of those artists' lists, except for Lorde,"
55:07;55:10;"which is just two people, herself included."
55:10;55:13;"There's a lot of people worked on that album, though."
55:13;55:14;"Is there?"
55:14;55:15;"We're getting into the weeds."
55:15;55:16;"Yes, we're getting into the weeds."
55:16;55:20;"But if you look at the Lorde album credits, it's a lot of people."
55:20;55:24;"All of these albums, Bruno is probably the artist who single-handedly did the most in"
55:24;55:27;"that he produces and performs."
55:27;55:31;"But whatever, all these people, I'm not saying to take anything away from any of these people."
55:31;55:36;"I'm just saying to the Grammy world, if the theme of this year's prom is no white guys"
55:36;55:40;"on stage at the end, choose wisely, my friend."
55:40;55:47;"Because when they do that wide shot, you might see a whole bunch of Caucasian males."
55:47;55:53;"Now we should also point out, as we talk about album of the year, there was one white guy"
55:53;55:57;"who was a real shocker not to see in the album of the year list."
55:57;55:58;"Who's that?"
55:58;55:59;"Babe Grohl."
55:59;56:00;"No."
56:00;56:06;"The big shocker is because he put out maybe one of the most commercially successful albums"
56:06;56:07;"of the year."
56:07;56:08;"Ed Sheeran."
56:08;56:09;"Interesting."
56:09;56:11;"Friend of the show."
56:11;56:12;"Snubbed."
56:12;56:13;"Shut out of every category."
56:13;56:14;"Really?"
56:14;56:17;"I think he got some random nomination."
56:17;56:18;"Bedsheets wasn't..."
56:18;56:19;"No bedsheets."
56:19;56:21;"Okay, well here's the thing."
56:21;56:24;"There's four categories that are called the big four."
56:24;56:27;"Album of the year, which we've discussed at length."
56:27;56:29;"Forty minutes in on album of the year."
56:29;56:33;"First new artist, which is going to be different every year."
56:33;56:35;"And then the last two are record of the year and song of the year."
56:35;56:38;"So you're saying what's the difference between record of the year and song of the year?"
56:38;56:42;"Record of the year is awarded to the artists and the producers and the recording engineers"
56:42;56:43;"and the mixers and blah, blah, blah."
56:43;56:46;"Because record of the year is about the recording."
56:46;56:50;"Song of the year, this one's for the songwriters."
56:50;56:55;"So for instance, if Sinead O'Connor was nominated for Nothing Compares to You, she could be"
56:55;56:59;"nominated for record of the year because that's the recording."
56:59;57:00;"Yeah."
57:00;57:05;"But if Nothing Compares to You wins song of the year, you're going to see Prince up there"
57:05;57:06;"because he wrote that song."
57:06;57:08;"Sinead did not write that song."
57:08;57:09;"That one's for the songwriters."
57:09;57:10;"Sometimes it's the same."
57:10;57:12;"We're going back to 1990 now."
57:12;57:13;"We're going back to 90."
57:13;57:19;"So anyway, so those are the two biggest categories for songs and Bedsheets, Shape of You, major"
57:19;57:21;"song this year, was shut out."
57:21;57:37;"It's been seven hours and 13 days since you took your love away."
57:37;58:00;"I go out every night and sleep all day since you took your love away."
58:00;58:09;"I can see whoever I choose."
58:09;58:15;"Eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant."
58:15;58:28;"But nothing, nothing can take away this feeling."
58:28;58:40;"Nothing compares to you."
58:40;58:47;"It's been so lonely without you here."
58:47;58:56;"I'm like a bird without a song."
58:56;59:02;"Nothing can stop this lonely rain."
59:02;59:11;"Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
59:11;59:32;"I'm like a bird without a song."
59:32;59:58;"Nothing can stop this lonely rain."
59:58;01:00:28;"Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
01:00:28;01:00:34;"I'm like a bird without a song."
01:00:34;01:00:41;"I'm like a bird without a song."
01:00:41;01:00:48;"Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
01:00:48;01:00:54;"I'm like a bird without a song."
01:00:54;01:01:01;"Nothing can stop this lonely rain."
01:01:01;01:01:08;"Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
