00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:11;"The early 2000s, the start of the new millennium, a new era in indie music,"
00:11;00:16;"and a time to move into your grandma's computer room."
00:16;00:24;"Four men in their 40s chop it up about life, purpose, chilling, and indie."
00:24;00:29;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"You were a pelt from beneath, all my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave the lonely bed"
01:16;01:21;"Time Crisis. Hey, what's up? We're back again."
01:21;01:24;"This feels weird with me doing this. Jake, what's going on?"
01:24;01:28;"We're banking, dude. We are remote. It's late at night and we are banking."
01:28;01:34;"Just for anybody wondering, Ezra is on this show. He's just asked us to kick it off."
01:34;01:37;"I'm just finishing my ice cream. Jake, go ahead."
01:37;01:42;"The flagship of the brand is hitting the road for bulk of the summer,"
01:42;01:45;"so we are trying to bank as much as we can."
01:45;01:49;"Banking the Ips. Yeah, I don't know when you'll hear this, but..."
01:49;01:54;"Banking the Ips. We're banking the Ips. Probably soon."
01:54;02:00;"You know, with these banked Ips, we try to keep things somewhat evergreen."
02:00;02:08;"You know, we're not going to be talking about the Kendrick Drake beef, for instance."
02:08;02:13;"You don't know when we're recording this, for all we know, it just kicked off."
02:13;02:17;"You might have already forgotten about it by now."
02:17;02:23;"Either we're recording this when it just kicked off, or for all you know, it's already over."
02:23;02:27;"And nobody knows when something like that will end, so who knows?"
02:27;02:30;"But we're not going to talk about stuff like that."
02:30;02:34;"This stuff that people think is so interesting for a week,"
02:34;02:37;"maybe you'll reflect on it at the end of the year, but, you know,"
02:37;02:42;"we're trying to go a little bit further back, a little more evergreen."
02:42;02:45;"These talking out of they necks. Don't put no coffin out of your mouth."
02:45;02:47;"I'm way too paranoid for threats. Aye, aye, let's get it, bro."
02:47;02:50;"D.O.T., the money power respect. The last one is better."
02:50;02:55;"Say yes a lot of goofies with a check. I mean, uh, I hope them sentiments symbolic."
02:55;02:58;"Uh, my temperament bipolar, I choose violence."
02:58;03:01;"Okay, let's get it up. It's time for him to prove that he's a problem."
03:01;03:04;"Clicking up, but it cannot be legit, no 40 water, tell 'em."
03:04;03:08;"Uh, yeah, yeah, get up with me. Sneak dis it. First person shooter."
03:08;03:11;"I hope they came with three switches. I crash out like, rap this."
03:11;03:16;"Melly meld if I had to. Got two T's with me. I'm snatching chains and burning tattoos."
03:16;03:22;"This opp lost too many soldiers, not to play it safe. If he walk around with that stick, it ain't Andre 3K."
03:22;03:28;"Think I won't drop the location. I still got PTSD. Mother f*** the big three. It's just big me."
03:28;03:33;"So, you know, we were racking our brains to come up with excellent topics for a banked ep."
03:33;03:39;"Because, first of all, I want to say there's absolutely no reason why a banked ep cannot be top tier TC."
03:39;03:40;"Oh, no reason at all."
03:40;03:44;"These could be some of our best episodes. We don't need to always be current."
03:44;03:50;"I mean, I think our Michael Azarad interview that's has already aired. That was a banked ep."
03:50;03:52;"Absolutely. Top tier."
03:52;03:58;"Seinfeld's guide to Taylor Swift was a banked ep. Maybe Seinfeld now's the time if you want to apologize."
03:58;04:04;"Oh, my God. Um, I didn't mean to misinform the viewership."
04:04;04:10;"I was getting a lot of my facts from the scoop.net, which I don't know if you're familiar, but, uh,"
04:10;04:17;"it's an up and coming entertainment gossip website that I won't be referring to again as a primary source."
04:17;04:24;"So for anyone who's misled, who anybody told their friends that Taylor Swift's first name was actually Penelope,"
04:24;04:31;"you know, I was I was duped as were you. And I'm sorry that I passed that misinformation along. It won't happen again."
04:31;04:34;"Nelly Swift. You're a Swifty, too."
04:34;04:51;"So died in the wool, Swifty to the bone marrow. And so, you know, it's doubly embarrassing to both forsake the integrity of the show and and also betray, you know, one of the top music artists of our day."
04:51;04:54;"And also betray Penelope Taylor Swift."
04:54;04:55;"Heir to the Swiffer."
04:55;04:57;"Heir to the Swiffer."
04:57;05:10;"All right. Well, we'll see how this goes. But my idea for today's BankedEP was to talk about a decade that I think often gets short shrift on this program."
05:10;05:21;"Obviously, we talk quite a bit about the tasteful palette of the 1970s. Top five often takes us into the 80s, the 90s."
05:21;05:30;"We have a lot of reminiscences about we have our famous Gen X 90s battles between Jake and Rashida."
05:30;05:37;"But, you know, one era that I feel like we rarely go deep in is the 2000s."
05:37;05:41;"And I want to correct that today. So let's take it to the 2000s."
05:41;05:52;"And what I threw out that this episode could be about 2000s era indie. I don't know if that's too narrow, but I think let's start there."
05:52;05:53;"Shoots too narrow."
05:53;06:01;"Those shoots might be a little too narrow, but let's see. I mean, first of all, let's get the rules of the game set."
06:01;06:07;"Are we counting the start of the 2000s as the year 2000 or the year 2001?"
06:07;06:08;"2000."
06:08;06:12;"OK, you count the zero years. I kind of do as well."
06:12;06:14;"Starts with a two, not a one."
06:14;06:16;"What if you're talking about the year 10?"
06:16;06:17;"Yeah."
06:17;06:25;"You know, like when you count from one to 10, 10 feels like the final year of the decade you just counted."
06:25;06:27;"No, it goes zero to nine with years."
06:27;06:32;"All right. Well, I guess that's the whole thing is that there was no year zero. Poor planning."
06:32;06:41;"Would your concern maybe be if we're doing music that a lot of that music might have been made in 2000, would have been made in 99?"
06:41;06:44;"And so maybe you wouldn't have that 2000 energy."
06:44;06:45;"So, you know what I mean?"
06:45;06:47;"That's interesting."
06:47;06:48;"Still has it."
06:48;06:52;"Not really. Let's go around. Jake, I want to start with you."
06:52;06:59;"Do you remember where you were January 1st, 2000? The start of the new millennium, debatably."
06:59;07:00;"Boston, Massachusetts."
07:00;07:01;"Boston?"
07:01;07:02;"Mm hmm."
07:02;07:05;"Did New Year's 99 in Boston."
07:05;07:06;"Interesting."
07:06;07:11;"Was hanging with my best friend from middle school and high school, John Joyce."
07:11;07:14;"Oh, yeah. We've heard about John Joyce before. You guys had a band together?"
07:14;07:17;"Yeah. We had Vince Chlortho together."
07:17;07:21;"Yeah, man. He was living in Boston. I don't remember how it panned out that way."
07:21;07:23;"Had you graduated college by then?"
07:23;07:26;"Yes. Yeah, I graduated in May 99."
07:26;07:31;"So, I was, I guess, seven months out from college graduation."
07:31;07:37;"Wow. So, the changing of the millennium really corresponded with a key moment in your own life."
07:37;07:38;"Absolutely."
07:38;07:42;"When you graduated college, was the commencement speaker being like,"
07:42;07:49;"""As the final graduates of the 20th century, you have so much to look forward to."
07:49;07:55;"The 2000s will be an epic era for you to begin your careers."""
07:55;08:00;"I'm sure that's what it was. I have zero recollection of my graduation ceremony."
08:00;08:06;"And I was stone cold sober. I just, it was that innocuous."
08:06;08:07;"No idea who spoke."
08:07;08:10;"Maybe you were just so in your head, you just tuned out all the speakers."
08:10;08:13;"You're just thinking like, ""Man, this is f***ing crazy."
08:13;08:17;"I'm a f***ing college graduate and we're about to enter the 2000s?"
08:17;08:18;"It's going to be insane."""
08:18;08:22;"I hope that job application I put in at Papa John's pans out."
08:58;09:08;"Wait, so you, when you graduated college, you stayed in Portland?"
09:08;09:13;"Yeah, I lived in Portland until summer 2003."
09:13;09:18;"And actually, when I was putting together my little playlist of 2000s indie rock,"
09:18;09:23;"I decided instead of like, yeah, I listened to the shins and I liked the shins a lot."
09:23;09:25;"I listened to the Strokes, great band."
09:25;09:28;"But for this playlist, I decided to go hyper local."
09:28;09:34;"Bands that, of people that I was friends with or knew a little bit or bands I was in,"
09:34;09:41;"in the Pacific Northwest or bands I toured with between 2000 and 2003."
09:41;09:43;"You were really at the heart of it."
09:43;09:47;"I think Jake, of everybody on this program, you have the most indie credentials."
09:47;09:50;"I don't know. Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting fight to have."
09:50;09:54;"I'm seeing Nick put up some resistance in his facial expression there."
09:54;09:58;"No, no, no. I mean, that's a hard, that was a hard agree."
09:58;10:00;"Well, I've just been in a lot of bands and I, yeah,"
10:00;10:03;"and I was never like a central figure in any of these scenes,"
10:03;10:07;"but I've just been in bands and know a lot of musicians."
10:07;10:09;"And yeah, I mean, Ezra, for you, it's different."
10:09;10:14;"I mean, you played in a few bands in college and then fresh college graduate."
10:14;10:16;"Sold out."
10:16;10:23;"You got a job at Goldman Sachs right after graduation, essentially."
10:23;10:26;"You know, so. That's right. I mean, it's a different scene."
10:26;10:29;"It's a different thing. I was jealous of the people who did."
10:29;10:33;"That was a moment in my life when I graduated college."
10:33;10:37;"I've actually been telling this story a lot as I've done, like, press the last few months."
10:37;10:41;"And people just inevitably take you back to, like, the early days of the band."
10:41;10:43;"Or how are you feeling back then?"
10:43;10:49;"One thing I always say is, like, I very distinctly remember the feeling of, like, graduation approaching"
10:49;10:56;"and A, realizing that I had tens of thousands of dollars in student loans,"
10:56;10:58;"which I just don't think I'd ever really thought about."
10:58;11:02;"And the truth is, I didn't have to pay an absurd amount monthly,"
11:02;11:09;"but even just, like, basically having no money and then just suddenly thinking,"
11:09;11:12;"""Wait, I'm in debt. Tens of thousands of dollars threw me for a loop."""
11:12;11:17;"And then also hearing about all the people at my school."
11:17;11:20;"You know, Columbia sends a lot of people into finance,"
11:20;11:22;"and a lot of people were going to work at Goldman Sachs."
11:22;11:27;"And they were some of the last people to go work at Lehman Brothers. Amazing timing."
11:27;11:29;"Wait, what year did you graduate college?"
11:29;11:31;"'06."
11:31;11:33;"Oh, wow. '06. Interesting."
11:33;11:38;"So Lehman, I think Lehman Brothers went, when did that go under? '08?"
11:38;11:41;"Yeah, like, fall of '08 during that crisis."
11:41;11:46;"Right. So, like, the young people working at Lehman then were essentially, like,"
11:46;11:49;"my classmates or, you know, people I would have gone to school with."
11:49;11:52;"But I remember hearing about all those people at that time and, like,"
11:52;11:55;"the months before graduation, and I remember people would say,"
11:55;11:58;"""What are you going to do?"" And I was like, ""You know, I don't know."""
11:58;12:01;"And then people being like, ""You know all those people working at Lehman"
12:01;12:07;"get a $10,000 signing bonus?"" And I just remember being like, ""What?"""
12:07;12:12;"They just give them $10,000 and it's like, ""Yeah, signing bonus. You just get it."""
12:12;12:16;"So just, like, in your bank account, it's like, ""Yeah, send you a check."""
12:16;12:18;"And they were like, ""And that's just a signing bonus."
12:18;12:20;"They also get year-end bonuses for performance."""
12:20;12:24;"And I was just like, ""I don't know why."" It's like, in many ways, I was--"
12:24;12:26;"Dude, I-- Well, sorry to interrupt."
12:26;12:29;"I just remember, like, when we were on that projectors tour in '05,"
12:29;12:34;"I guess you were going into your junior or senior year of college."
12:34;12:35;"Yeah."
12:35;12:38;"I guess you would have been going into-- I guess--"
12:38;12:39;"Into my senior year, yeah."
12:39;12:43;"Okay. And I remember you being like, ""Yeah, maybe I'll, like, get a job."""
12:43;12:46;"Like, you were just dead-ass serious, like, ""Maybe I'll get a job in, like,"
12:46;12:48;"finance or something."""
12:48;12:50;"I remember you were like, you didn't know what you were going to do."
12:50;12:54;"And I remember thinking, ""Man, don't do that. You're too cool for that, dude."""
12:54;12:57;"Start a band. Start an internet radio show."
12:57;12:59;"[laughs]"
12:59;13:01;"Believe in yourself."
13:01;13:05;"But then you emailed me some of the early Vampire demos, and you were like,"
13:05;13:08;"""Hey, we're coming to San Francisco. Could you help us get a show,"
13:08;13:10;"like, in a backyard show or something?"""
13:10;13:11;"Right."
13:11;13:13;"And I was like, ""Yeah, cool."" And I was like, ""Oh, this is tight."
13:13;13:18;"I'm glad this dude started a band and isn't, like, working at Lehman."""
13:18;13:20;"Not that I knew what Lehman was."
13:20;13:22;"And then, like, a few months later, you were like, ""Band's taking off."""
13:22;13:24;"And I was like, ""Word."""
13:24;13:27;"Well, and also the sad truth is I'd already missed the boat, probably,"
13:27;13:29;"to go work at Lehman."
13:29;13:30;"Sad truth."
13:30;13:33;"I actually--I do know one guy who's very successful in finance"
13:33;13:36;"who was an English major, but even then, he had already done, like,"
13:36;13:40;"summer internships and stuff, so he was on the track."
13:40;13:42;"So, yeah, I'd probably already missed the boat."
13:42;13:45;"I probably could have gone to, like, law school or something."
13:45;13:47;"I wonder if I ever would have--"
13:47;13:49;"Law school, I don't know what it is now."
13:49;13:51;"At the time, that was the most classic thing, where it's like,"
13:51;13:55;"if you major in English or something, and you're, like, trying to get"
13:55;13:58;"more serious, you're like, ""I'll go to law school."""
13:58;14:00;"I remember a college professor saying that."
14:00;14:04;"They were like, ""If you don't know what you want to do, go to law school."""
14:04;14:06;"Yeah, I don't think--I don't know if they say that anymore."
14:06;14:09;"At the time, they were like, ""You can use that degree for a lot of things."""
14:09;14:10;"Yeah, yeah."
14:10;14:12;"It's really hard to say."
14:12;14:17;"I wonder if I ever would have gotten, like, passionate about the law."
14:17;14:22;"Such a sliding door--like, yeah, I mean, it's so crazy."
14:22;14:25;"Like, the band either, like, doesn't work out or doesn't even, like,"
14:25;14:30;"start for whatever reason--you don't meet Rostam or C.T. or Bao or whatever."
14:30;14:31;"It's just different chemistry."
14:31;14:34;"The band sort of, like, just doesn't do what it does."
14:34;14:39;"And then you go to law school, like, three years after graduating."
14:39;14:41;"You start law school in '09."
14:41;14:44;"You finish in 2012."
14:44;14:49;"It's just like--man, what a weird, different path."
14:49;14:55;"I see a mansard roof through the trees"
14:55;15:00;"I see a salty message written in the eaves"
15:00;15:03;"The ground beneath my feet"
15:03;15:05;"The odd garbage and concrete"
15:05;15:10;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too"
15:10;15:18;"[drums]"
15:18;15:24;"I see a mansard roof through the trees"
15:24;15:29;"I see a salty message written in the eaves"
15:29;15:32;"The ground beneath my feet"
15:32;15:34;"The odd garbage and concrete"
15:34;15:41;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too"
15:41;16:03;"[drums]"
16:03;16:08;"I wonder--I mean, I know a lot of people who became lawyers and, like, hate it."
16:08;16:09;"Oh, yeah."
16:09;16:12;"I've also met successful lawyers who kind of, like, live for it."
16:12;16:15;"Those people tend to be a lot higher energy than me."
16:15;16:18;"I don't know if I'd have the energy to be, like, doing those long nights."
16:18;16:21;"Yeah, well, one of your great passions is chilling, so--"
16:21;16:22;"No, for real."
16:22;16:27;"Yeah, just, like, doing, like, document analysis at, like, 4 a.m."
16:27;16:29;"Yeah, that's what I always picture."
16:29;16:33;"I picture, like, young lawyers just being awake at 4 a.m., pouring over documents."
16:33;16:36;"And I just feel like I'd be so tired."
16:36;16:37;"You know what's funny, actually?"
16:37;16:38;"I have a distinct memory."
16:38;16:41;"So tired."
16:41;16:43;"I mean, I've always been low energy."
16:43;16:48;"Maybe I could have figured out some other way to do it."
16:48;16:51;"Like, obviously, like, the law is interesting."
16:51;16:55;"But I actually remember--speaking of, like, sliding doors moments--"
16:55;17:01;"I remember maybe some year in college--let's say towards the end--maybe senior year,"
17:01;17:08;"and just, again, as much as I felt like I was kind of savvy about certain things,"
17:08;17:13;"I guess I just wasn't passionate about, like, you know, getting a great job or anything."
17:13;17:17;"But I remember starting to look around and be like, ""Wait, oh, yeah, you're supposed to get, like,"
17:17;17:21;"internships or, you know, work in white-collar professions."""
17:21;17:24;"Like, I made a little bit of money in college tutoring."
17:24;17:26;"That was about it."
17:26;17:34;"And I had, like, a financial aid job working in the--scanning slides in the art department or something."
17:34;17:35;"I don't know."
17:35;17:38;"But at some point I was like, ""Oh, maybe I should get a more, like, serious job."""
17:38;17:42;"So I was, like, looking through listings that they had, and one of them was, like,"
17:42;17:48;"""Intern copyist needed for legal firm."""
17:48;17:51;"And I was like, ""Oh, right. Maybe this is the kind of thing you're supposed to do."
17:51;17:53;"You make some money."""
17:53;17:55;"Who knows? At the time it was probably like $15 an hour."
17:55;17:57;"And I was like, ""That's pretty good."""
17:57;18:01;"And anyway, I just remember in college I was on such a late schedule, you know,"
18:01;18:07;"found it so hard to ever--if I had a class at, like, 10 a.m., it was, like, torture waking up for that class."
18:07;18:12;"So anyway, I remember I had, like, an interview with a lawyer, and it was like--"
18:12;18:16;"and I remember I borrowed, like, a nice sweater from my friend,"
18:16;18:20;"but I ended up, like, staying up all night in some, like, debate with somebody."
18:20;18:23;"And then the next morning I woke up so tired."
18:23;18:26;"I don't know if I had my coffee game quite dialed yet."
18:26;18:32;"It was kind of hit or miss, and I, you know, I'd beeline it down to this, you know,"
18:32;18:37;"law firm, like, probably, like, you know, in the '50s on Park Avenue or something."
18:37;18:41;"And I go, and I remember the guy was actually very warm and friendly, and he was like,"
18:41;18:45;"""Oh, nice to meet you. Oh, you go to Columbia. I got some good friends who went there."""
18:45;18:47;"And we're, like, shooting the sh*t. I was just so tired."
18:47;18:52;"He was like, ""All right, all I need you to do is just type up this document."""
18:52;18:55;"And I just remember kind of being zoned out and typing it up,"
18:55;18:59;"and, like, he came back in and looked at it, and I made, like, two mistakes."
18:59;19:01;"And he was-- and I just remember he looked at me with pity."
19:01;19:04;"He was like, ""Yeah, I'm sorry, man."""
19:04;19:06;"[laughs]"
19:06;19:09;"Like, this is the kind of thing, you know, you kind of just have to nail it."
19:09;19:13;"And I was like, ""I hear you. Yeah, I think I was just tired."""
19:13;19:16;"And, you know, anyway, who knows? I remember that guy was very friendly,"
19:16;19:19;"and I kind of felt bad that, like, I let him down. He wasn't an a**hole."
19:19;19:22;"It's cool he was a straight shooter, and he wasn't like, ""We'll call you."""
19:22;19:26;"Yeah, he was kind of like, ""Oh, dude, you know, you had one job, kind of."
19:26;19:30;"Just type this document absolutely correctly."""
19:30;19:33;"But, yeah, who knows? That might have been the sliding doors moment."
19:33;19:38;"Maybe if I'd become, whatever, an intern or an assistant for this warm and friendly lawyer--"
19:38;19:40;"I have no idea what type of lawyer he was--"
19:40;19:43;"maybe over time he would have, like, become my mentor,"
19:43;19:48;"and maybe he would have been giving me the opposite advice of you, Jake."
19:48;19:51;"I'd, like, play him some Vampire Weekend demos, and he's just like,"
19:51;19:57;"""Honestly, man, I'm not hearing it. You lack the downtown grit of The Strokes."
19:57;20:01;"The Songcraft is not at the level of The Shins or the other prominent indie artists of the day,"
20:01;20:04;"and I think you really have a bright future here at my law firm."""
20:04;20:07;"And I'd be like, ""Thank you, sir."""
20:07;20:13;"Ezra, the music industry is a cutthroat business. It's very competitive."
20:13;20:18;"He's like, ""When you first came into my office and you absolutely, perfectly, with zero mistakes,"
20:18;20:23;"nailed that document type up, I knew you had aptitude for this."
20:23;20:30;"I'm not hearing it in this '07 Oxford comma .mp3' that you're sending me."""
20:30;20:33;"Who gives an F about an Oxford comma? Ezra, we do."
20:33;20:36;"Yeah, we do."
20:36;20:43;"'Bout an Oxford comma, I've seen those English dramas too, their crew"
20:43;20:51;"So if there's any other way to spell the word, it's fine with me, with me"
20:51;20:55;"Why would you speak to me that way?"
20:55;21:03;"Especially when I always said that I haven't got the words for you"
21:03;21:07;"All your diction, dripping with disdain"
21:07;21:15;"Through the pain, I always tell the truth"
21:15;21:23;"Who gives an F about an Oxford comma? I climbed the Darmstadt or two, I did"
21:23;21:31;"I met the high slimer, his accent sounded fine to me, to me"
21:31;21:35;"Check your handbook, it's no trick"
21:35;21:39;"Take the chapstick, put it on your lips"
21:39;21:43;"Crack a smile, adjust my tie"
21:43;21:47;"Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys"
21:47;21:51;"Why would you lie about how much coal you had?"
21:51;21:55;"Why would you lie about something dumb like that?"
21:55;21:58;"Why would you lie about anything at all?"
21:58;22:02;"First the window, then it's through the wall"
22:02;22:06;"A little time, we always tell the truth"
22:06;22:08;"Yeah, who knows, maybe even said, ""And you know what?"
22:08;22:14;"You work in litigation for five years, and if you feel unfulfilled,"
22:14;22:18;"move out to LA and get into showbiz law."""
22:18;22:24;"You'd be like, ""You know what's cooler than being a member of Interpol?"
22:24;22:30;"Being their lawyer."" Like, absolutely, absolutely, sir."
22:30;22:32;"I don't know, who knows, maybe."
22:32;22:36;"Did you ever consider going white-collar, Jake? Was that ever in the cards for you?"
22:36;22:38;"Nope."
22:38;22:40;"Didn't have a plan B ever. I, um..."
22:40;22:43;"He's our most indie member. Absolutely."
22:43;22:45;"Yeah, you're too indie. You're too generous and indie."
22:45;22:47;"I graduated college, and I was like,"
22:47;22:53;"I know that I'm gonna have to, like, figure out a way to make a living for many, many decades."
22:53;22:56;"I know people can make a living as artists."
22:56;22:59;"I'm gonna try to figure out how to do that, and I know,"
22:59;23:04;"reading about history and artists, that it can take a while."
23:04;23:07;"So I had various day jobs until I was 38."
23:07;23:11;"In fact, I was still working, I still had a day job when I started doing Time Crisis with you guys."
23:11;23:13;"Oh, really? Hanging art?"
23:13;23:17;"Yeah, I was doing art install at various galleries around LA."
23:17;23:18;"Whoa."
23:18;23:26;"I think we've touched on this. My final gig was doing a private install at Jay-Z and Beyonce's rental home in Beverly Hills."
23:26;23:30;"Maybe that was just on the text thread, but maybe we talked about it on the show. I don't remember."
23:30;23:33;"I think we only talked about this in the thread, right?"
23:33;23:36;"Yeah, I was working for this company. Oh, yeah, this guy."
23:36;23:38;"The listeners will enjoy this."
23:38;23:44;"This guy, Brian, who had been a former actor, who then started..."
23:44;23:47;"He started a private art installation company."
23:47;23:52;"To be clear, an actor in the TNBC sitcom One World."
23:52;23:54;"Thank you. You have a better memory than I do."
23:54;23:57;"I had to do a little research when we were texting about this."
23:57;24:09;"And so, yeah, he would hire a crew of guys to go, like, you know, get a box truck, go to a warehouse, pick up a collector's art collection that's in storage,"
24:09;24:17;"drive it to their house, unload it, uncrate the art, bring the art into the house, place the art,"
24:17;24:21;"consult with either the interior decorator, the art consultant, or the owner."
24:21;24:24;"In this case, Jay-Z and Beyonce."
24:24;24:27;"Although it was a rental home, but it was their art collection."
24:27;24:32;"And then hang the art. And they were there that day."
24:32;24:35;"I guess it was a two-day job, actually. They were there."
24:35;24:43;"It wasn't their, like, primo stuff. I think Jay-Z has, like, bosque yachts and, like, really crazy high-end stuff."
24:43;24:47;"And Picasso? Remember he had a son called Picasso Baby?"
24:47;24:49;"Oh, yeah. I wouldn't surprise me."
24:49;24:51;"Is that about owning a Picasso?"
24:51;24:54;"Wait, Jake, I gotta ask you, though. Did you sign an NDA that day?"
24:54;24:57;"I don't think so."
24:57;25:00;"I mean, yeah, they were around, minimal interaction."
25:00;25:09;"I do remember, like, me and this other dude hanging this, like, pretty heavy painting over the mantel place above the fireplace."
25:09;25:20;"Kind of like, we're both on ladders and kind of, like, straining to, like, hold the art up and get it on the hardware that we had installed into the wall."
25:20;25:28;"And, like, Jay-Z kind of ambling into the room and kind of, like, just standing there and just kind of staring at us."
25:28;25:32;"Picture a Jay-Z voice. He's going, ""What up, fellas?"""
25:32;25:34;"[Laughs]"
25:34;25:39;"I can't do a Jay-Z impression. But you got—every listener in their head can imagine it."
25:39;25:42;"And you're like, ""Hello, Mr. Carter."""
25:42;25:44;"Yep, basically."
26:46;26:52;"Are you wearing gloves in a situation like this? Like, how are you touching the art? Hands on?"
26:52;26:55;"Probably, yeah. Probably wearing white cotton gloves."
26:55;26:57;"Okay, good."
26:57;27:01;"And then, yeah, Beyonce was there and their kid—Blue, was that their name?"
27:01;27:02;"Yeah, Blue Ivy."
27:02;27:03;"That's their first child."
27:03;27:08;"Right. I remember—and I remember my—the guy that ran the company, this guy Brian, was, like, pretending to be a robot."
27:08;27:15;"He had—he was holding, like, a drill and he's going, like, ""Zzz, zzz, zzz,"" you know, like, pretending to be a robot and, like, cracking their kid up."
27:15;27:18;"And that was the final job I had in 2015."
27:18;27:26;"Was that a stressful job? Were you ever like, ""Oh, God, what if the art gets messed up or I drop it or something?"""
27:26;27:37;"It could be. I mean, it would—I wasn't worried about dropping the art or messing it up, but if the clients were stressed out and were giving off bad vibes, then that was stressful."
27:37;27:42;"But Jay-Z and Beyonce were lovely and mellow and weren't, like, sweating us, you know what I mean?"
27:42;27:43;"Right."
27:43;27:50;"Sometimes doing private installs, there's, like, an idle rich person that has nothing better to do than sort of, like, stress everyone out."
27:50;27:52;"Like, ""Be careful, be careful, don't touch that."""
27:52;28:00;"Yeah, or just kind of standing and, like, watching, loitering for—like, just, like, basically watching people work."
28:00;28:09;"Imagine just, like, using the stud finder to find the studs or, like, putting in, like, ""Oh, this wall is actually concrete."
28:09;28:16;"We need to actually get the masonry bit out and put in, like, these, like, heavy-duty anchors. This is going to take a while."
28:16;28:21;"Oh, we, like, hit a weird part of the wall. Like, this is a soft part of the concrete. The anchor's not going to hold."
28:21;28:25;"Okay, we actually have to, like—and then they're like, ""You have to patch that when you're done."""
28:25;28:27;"And we're like, ""Yep, we know."" Like, just that kind of vibe."
28:27;28:29;"So you're good at patching walls?"
28:29;28:37;"Yeah, I'm not, like, some sort of construction expert, but I'm handy with basic tools, you know?"
28:37;28:42;"What if it's, like, a paint—like, an unusual color paint or a wallpaper or something?"
28:42;28:45;"Wallpaper, that's a whole other—I don't mess with wallpaper."
28:45;28:48;"I mean, if someone has to replace wallpaper, there's people that do that."
28:48;28:50;"There are wallpaper people."
28:50;28:51;"Right."
28:51;28:57;"I mean, paint is just sort of—hopefully they have, in the garage, they have the paint there."
28:57;29:04;"If not, I guess you have to, like, make a little chip and bring it to the store and have them match it. But that's dicey."
29:04;29:08;"Yeah, and hopefully there's not too much patching or repainting anyway."
29:08;29:14;"Yeah, I mean, usually at those kind of houses, there's, like, a house manager that knows where, like, the paint is."
29:14;29:16;"It's not a big deal."
29:16;29:21;"But anyway, yeah, as you guys know, I was a certified forklift driver, so—"
29:21;29:22;"Right."
29:22;29:24;"I'm handy with tools and—"
29:24;29:25;"You had all sorts of jobs."
29:25;29:26;"Some machinery."
29:26;29:29;"I mean, you've always struck me as very easygoing."
29:29;29:37;"You say that even from, you know, relatively early in your career, you knew the art history, you had an understanding."
29:37;29:44;"It can take a long time to become a full-time artist, to make it, and you're okay with that."
29:44;29:54;"Were there any times between age 22 and 38 where you were just, like, seriously stressing or being like, ""Damn, this is taking a long time,"" or—"
29:54;29:56;"Oh, yeah, definitely."
29:56;30:00;"But even in those moments, did that make you consider anything else?"
30:00;30:06;"No, I mean, I think my lowest point was 2010, 2011."
30:06;30:11;"We touched on this before, maybe in New York, when I lived there for a few years."
30:11;30:12;"Right."
30:12;30:17;"But even in the years in Oakland, I mean, it was—yeah, I mean, I didn't have a plan B, man."
30:17;30:28;"You know, there's the stories of, like, actors, like, Jon Hamm or someone who was like, ""I decided if I wasn't—like, if I didn't make it, if I wasn't making a living by 35 or 30 or whatever it was, then I would do something else."""
30:28;30:29;"I never did that."
30:29;30:31;"Like, what am I going to do at, like, age 32?"
30:31;30:34;"Like, just, like, I'm throwing in the towel."
30:34;30:35;"I'm going to law school."
30:35;30:36;"I don't know."
30:36;30:37;"I wasn't married or—"
30:37;30:38;"People do that."
30:38;30:39;"No, sure."
30:39;30:45;"I wasn't married or had a kid or, you know, have a house or anything when I was 32, so I don't know."
30:45;30:46;"Right."
30:46;30:53;"So even at your lowest point, you were still just like, well, you didn't feel amazing, but you were just like, ""I have to just keep painting."
30:53;30:54;"What else can I do?"""
30:54;30:55;"Basically."
30:55;30:57;"I guess I'm going to have to do time crisis."
30:57;31:02;"I mean, if I had a kid or something, it might—it'd probably be a different story."
31:02;31:03;"Right."
31:03;31:04;"Yeah, you were a single guy."
31:04;31:05;"Yeah."
31:05;31:07;"In all these places, you had pretty cheap rent."
31:07;31:14;"I mean, I remember when you first moved to L.A., you had a roommate, and your rent couldn't have been too much, right?"
31:14;31:15;"I moved to L.A. in 2012."
31:15;31:17;"I was 35."
31:17;31:25;"I moved in with this random dude, Ryan, who ended up being a really good friend and is in Richard Pictures and Mountain Bruce."
31:25;31:27;"But you had no connection to him at the time."
31:27;31:28;"I didn't know him at all."
31:28;31:30;"How did you find him?"
31:30;31:31;"Like, crazy?"
31:31;31:41;"I was crashing with my second cousin, who lived in Silver Lake, and he was on a swim team or something."
31:41;31:43;"Like an adult intramural swim team?"
31:43;31:44;"Adult intramural swim team."
31:44;31:50;"Some sort of swimming club or something with a friend of Ryan's girlfriend."
31:50;31:55;"And he had heard, ""Oh, there's this guy that friend of a friend needs a roommate."""
31:55;31:58;"And so I went over—this was day three in L.A."
31:58;32:00;"And I was like, ""Okay, I'll go check out the apartment."""
32:00;32:02;"It was on Normandy and Santa Monica."
32:02;32:03;"Ezra, you came there a few times."
32:03;32:06;"Yeah, it was by that street, Lemongrove, right?"
32:06;32:08;"Yeah, exactly. You'd park in Lemongrove."
32:08;32:14;"And so I went and met Ryan, and there was a framed picture of Neil Young in the hallway."
32:14;32:16;"I was like, ""Okay, cool."""
32:16;32:18;"And then he had a big record collection."
32:18;32:20;"He had some dirty projector stuff."
32:20;32:21;"I was like, ""Oh, a day with my brother."""
32:21;32:23;"He was like, ""No way."""
32:23;32:25;"And then he made a good pitch."
32:25;32:28;"He was basically, ""Listen, dude, the rent's like $600."
32:28;32:30;"Why don't you just move in?"
32:30;32:32;"If you don't like it, you can move out in a few months."""
33:23;33:28;"This is very interesting, this time period, because I imagine we probably have some listeners."
33:28;33:31;"I bet we might have a listener right now who's 35."
33:31;33:34;"Also, maybe they're focused on a dream."
33:34;33:35;"Maybe they don't even have a dream."
33:35;33:37;"They're not sure what they're doing."
33:37;33:46;"But I think I always like hearing stories like this, you know, about all the different ways that people are living."
33:46;33:52;"Being 35, moving to LA, having a roommate, $600 a month rent."
33:52;33:56;"You're probably not dropping too much on food and stuff."
33:56;34:00;"So you really didn't need--and like you said, you're single, no kid."
34:00;34:05;"So, you know, you could probably make it by on, what, $30,000 a year?"
34:05;34:06;"Less?"
34:06;34:08;"Something, probably less."
34:08;34:11;"Probably that first year, hard to say."
34:11;34:19;"But I have to say, once I--I knew that I wanted to live in LA, so things started to kind of happen for me pretty quickly."
34:19;34:20;"I was in the right town."
34:20;34:22;"Right, you just knew it."
34:22;34:25;"Because I--yeah, so I stopped working in 2015."
34:25;34:29;"So I only worked--I only had day jobs in LA for like two and a half, three years."
34:29;34:33;"When you first moved in with Ryan, you were just so psyched to be in LA."
34:33;34:37;"You never got into some like, ""I'm 35."""
34:37;34:40;"Like some people for sure, if they're age 30--"
34:40;34:41;"35."
34:41;34:49;"35, just moved in with a, at the time, random dude roommate, would be a little like, ""What? Oh, man."""
34:49;34:52;"But at that point, you had a pretty--you felt good."
34:52;35:00;"I mean, I was psyched, but like, yeah, I was aware that like, it definitely like, not great optics."
35:00;35:06;"I remember my parents like, came and like, visited the apartment that I was living in with Ryan."
35:06;35:09;"And they like, met Ryan."
35:09;35:12;"And it turned out Ryan was born 10 days after me."
35:12;35:20;"So it was like two 35-year-old dudes living in this like, crappy apartment in East Hollywood."
35:20;35:21;"Great sitcom."
35:21;35:23;"Yeah, just like a cool vibe."
35:23;35:25;"You're right. It is all optics."
35:25;35:32;"And I mean, obviously, it's such a good lesson to stop caring about optics when you know you're actually enjoying yourself."
35:32;35:40;"But I think 35 is an interesting age because at age 35, you're living in the way that a lot of 25-year-olds live."
35:40;35:41;"Exactly."
35:41;35:46;"Like, if you met somebody who's 25 and they're like, ""Oh, dude, I just moved into this apartment."""
35:46;35:50;"Like, with a random dude, but he's cool. He's got a Neil Young poster."
35:50;35:52;"""I just got to LA. I'm excited."""
35:52;35:55;"You'd be like, ""Wow, that sounds like a really exciting time in your life."""
35:55;35:58;"Full of potential and opportunity."
35:58;36:01;"25 in a new city? Sounds awesome."
36:01;36:04;"Then you're 35 and you're kind of like, ""All right."""
36:04;36:06;"It ain't over yet."
36:06;36:18;"But then if you go another 10 years and you're like, ""Well, 10 years ago I was doing this and then another 10 years later, what if it's two 45-year-old dudes in the apartment?"""
36:18;36:20;"We're back to cool again."
36:20;36:22;"We just hung around."
36:22;36:30;"I mean, at that point, the optics are so bad that they actually kind of rule."
36:30;36:42;"You actually have to be so... I think at that point you're just like, ""Hey, it's cool. I met another 45-year-old guy. I don't know him at all, but he's got a cool spot. I moved into the extra room."""
36:42;36:44;"And get this, he had a Neil Young poster."
36:44;36:46;"It's cheap, dude."
36:46;36:52;"I lucked out. You know what, guys? Sorry. Lizzie's up. I have to go deal with this."
36:52;36:53;"Okay."
36:53;36:55;"That was my life story."
36:55;36:58;"So much has changed in those 10 years."
36:58;37:00;"Okay."
37:00;37:04;"I have to go deal with... I'm solo dadding for a while."
37:04;37:11;"What happened to you, man? Back when you were 35, you were just f***ing drinking brews by a Neil Young poster. Now you're taking care of a little kid?"
37:11;37:13;"Now I'm sipping red wine."
37:13;37:16;"Sipping red wine, taking care of children?"
37:16;37:18;"Now do your thing."
37:18;37:19;"All right, I'll be back in a bit."
37:19;37:29;"I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling wrong in the drama of my life."
37:29;37:38;"Let's make some music, make some money, find some models for wives."
37:38;37:48;"I'll go to Paris, shoot some heroin with the stars."
37:48;37:57;"You and the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars."
37:57;38:02;"This is our decision to live fast and die young."
38:02;38:16;"We've got the vision, now let's have some fun."
38:16;38:21;"Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?"
38:21;38:27;"Get jobs and offices and wake up for the morning news."
38:27;38:30;"I just rewatched Swingers."
38:30;38:35;"It's the best version of the 25-year-old story you told."
38:35;38:39;"And even then, they're sort of like, ""We're too old for this."""
38:39;38:43;"It really captures the Hollywood f***ing department."
38:43;38:47;"But I like doing that now where they still haven't made it and they're 35."
38:47;38:50;"I mean, and obviously the ages change."
38:50;38:52;"Every generation, the ages get like crazier."
38:52;38:56;"Like, yeah, you watch old movies where people are literally just like,"
38:56;39:02;"""Dude, I'm 23 years old and I don't even know what job I want."""
39:02;39:04;"Like, all my friends are, you know, and then you're like,"
39:04;39:06;"""Nobody would say that today."""
39:06;39:10;"People treat 23-year-old like they're literally a toddler."
39:10;39:17;"So even now it's like in another era, the two 35-year-old dudes would almost read as like 50."
39:17;39:18;"Yeah."
39:18;39:20;"And I guess also we're getting older too."
39:20;39:26;"So like if I met somebody who was 35 and just moved in, yeah, I don't know."
39:26;39:28;"Maybe they would read as 25 to me now."
39:28;39:31;"But you're right, in the Swingers era, those guys are in their 20s."
39:31;39:33;"And they're like, ""I got two more weeks of doing this."
39:33;39:36;"And if I don't get a job, I got to--"
39:36;39:38;"Essentially, I think he is like, ""I got to go become a lawyer."""
39:38;39:40;"It's something like that."
39:40;39:42;"But yeah, 35 is a weird danger zone."
39:42;39:43;"I'm actually with you."
39:43;39:48;"At age 45, hopefully you've acquired enough life wisdom and stuff"
39:48;39:53;"that you actually could be roommates with a random 45-year-old dude and just be zen about it."
39:53;39:54;"Yeah."
39:54;39:58;"I think that you're back to the point of being like, ""We're just having a blast, guys."""
39:58;40:01;"I think that, yeah, you've gone through the awkward zone."
40:01;40:03;"I mean, I definitely have a feeling--"
40:03;40:13;"In my 20s and my early 30s, that was the period of life where I worried the most about the outcomes that I found depressing."
40:13;40:20;"Whereas, you know, even when you're like, ""Oh, man, what if you're old and you're all alone when you're old?"""
40:20;40:24;"Or if you had anybody in your family growing up who was living--"
40:24;40:29;"just always kind of lived by themselves, and you're like, ""Oh, man, what's that like? Is that so lonely?"""
40:29;40:34;"Whereas, of course, I have a family that I love, and I love spending time with my friends."
40:34;40:37;"But at this point, I'm kind of like, ""You know what?"
40:37;40:42;"If that's where life takes you and you end up living alone your whole life,"
40:42;40:47;"by the time you're 75 or something, yeah, that could be weirdly cool, too."""
40:47;40:52;"I could see how there could be a soulfulness in every type of living."
40:52;40:59;"But I was obsessively scared about like, ""Oh, God, what if I live in a place I don't like?"
40:59;41:03;"What if I end up in a city that bums me out?"
41:03;41:06;"What if I'm away from the people I know and I'm hanging out with people?"""
41:06;41:11;"Now I can see the silver linings in all that stuff."
41:11;41:13;"Did you guys-- Seinfeld and Nick--"
41:13;41:19;"Did you guys ever have a period of major career and/or life anxiety?"
41:19;41:21;"What am I doing?"
41:21;41:24;"If you still have it, by all means, let us know."
41:24;41:26;"This is no judgment zone."
41:26;41:29;"We've talked maybe a bit about it."
41:29;41:33;"I started working at such a young age."
41:33;41:35;"I had a real job."
41:35;41:43;"I had this magazine maybe I've talked about on the show, but in college I started this magazine."
41:43;41:47;"I was an editor and publisher of a magazine."
41:47;41:53;"It was a lot of work and that immediately went directly into Adult Swim."
41:53;41:56;"You're a go-getter and you're a high-energy person."
41:56;41:58;"I am a high-energy person."
41:58;42:00;"I definitely feel like I was fairly ambitious."
42:00;42:05;"But at 23, 24 is when I got this job at Adult Swim."
42:05;42:12;"I had a real-- I moved to Atlanta at 24 to manage people."
42:12;42:18;"It felt like I was in a different zone than all of my other friends."
42:18;42:19;"It happened by accident."
42:19;42:24;"The most anxiety I felt was right before that."
42:24;42:28;"I don't think that we've really talked about it much, but there was a period--"
42:28;42:30;"When you moved in with your grandma?"
42:30;42:32;"When I moved in with my grandma, I moved to an old person."
42:32;42:35;"I moved into an assisted living home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida."
42:35;42:41;"I was an investigative reporter, but I was definitely not in a good space."
42:41;42:45;"I feel I had-- There was a moment where I had stopped--"
42:45;42:51;"That right there, that's the perfect example of something that is so obviously cool."
42:51;42:54;"I'm sure you tell the story now."
42:54;42:57;"Even without details, we're already just like, ""That's sick."""
42:57;43:00;"It sounds like a movie or something."
43:00;43:07;"But when you're 23 and you're hanging in the assisted living home in Fort Lauderdale,"
43:07;43:12;"I could see that you're just like, ""Wait, am I supposed to be in New York or LA right now?"
43:12;43:17;"Am I supposed to be doing something different?"""
43:17;43:20;"Whereas now, if somebody told any of us--"
43:20;43:23;"If I tell this to anybody, this is one of the few things."
43:23;43:26;"This and the Pentagon story, that's the other thing."
43:26;43:29;"I was working at the Pentagon, as we talked about, when I was 17, 18 years old."
43:29;43:31;"Then it rolled right in this way."
43:31;43:33;"I always thought I had something."
43:33;43:35;"I was on track."
43:35;43:39;"As part of the deep state, you always had something to fall back on."
43:39;43:45;"Totally. I had too much intel for them to flounder too hard."
43:45;43:50;"But I think that there's something about that period that now I tell people,"
43:50;43:53;"and it's almost like across the board, they're like, ""You got to make a TV show about that."""
43:53;44:00;"It is very funny and it feels very cool, but I moved to Florida because I don't have a job."
44:00;44:03;"This magazine I started, I had this awful breakup with my partner."
44:03;44:07;"We fold this magazine that I thought would be the rest of my life."
44:07;44:10;"It was like vice. I thought I would do this thing forever."
44:10;44:18;"I move in. A friend of mine who was a photographer for the magazine tells me that I can stay with her."
44:18;44:24;"She thinks she can get me a job writing for this weekly, doing some investigative reporting."
44:24;44:30;"As soon as I moved to Florida with nothing, I didn't totally put together that she had just gotten married."
44:30;44:36;"I knew she was with someone, but literally they'd gotten married and they did not want me there."
44:36;44:39;"Specifically, she didn't want me there over a week."
44:39;44:42;"I was like, ""I don't have anywhere to go."" So she kicked me out."
44:42;44:46;"The only other person I knew in Florida was my grandma who lived in an assisted living home."
44:46;44:50;"The Alt Weekly was a Fort Lauderdale-based newspaper?"
44:50;44:56;"It's the Broward County New Times, which also there's a Miami New Times, which is the equivalent."
44:56;44:58;"Fort Lauderdale is near Miami."
44:58;45:03;"Yeah, but it's Broward County. They're closer, about an hour away, 45 minutes away from each other."
45:03;45:05;"So I move in with my grandma."
45:05;45:12;"I'm working this very strange investigative reporting job that I'm not really qualified for."
45:12;45:16;"I don't know how long I can keep that kind of charade going."
45:16;45:19;"I'm not making very much money."
45:19;45:26;"I'll go out and party really, really hard and then drive home to this assisted living home."
45:26;45:28;"Who did you party with? You just made friends?"
45:28;45:37;"Yeah, there were other young people, like the people at this Alt Weekly that would cover the bar section, the nightclub section."
45:37;45:38;"Is this Atlanta?"
45:38;45:43;"No, this was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, living with my grandma."
45:43;45:54;"There's a lot of very funny details, like how I'd end up eating four or five meals a day because I'd eat dinner with her at four o'clock."
45:54;45:58;"Then I would go out to eat a real dinner around eight o'clock."
45:58;46:06;"Then I'd be up partying until 2.30 in the morning and eat another meal at some diner at 2.30."
46:06;46:12;"What kind of stuff were you investigating? Were you trying to blow the top off the cocaine?"
46:12;46:19;"My biggest one that took the longest was I saw that there was this loophole in the gambling law."
46:19;46:25;"There was no gambling that was legal, but they would basically get old people and a lot of people that were in this assisted living home."
46:25;46:36;"They would go to these makeshift strip mall casinos where they would be gambling for Walmart gift cards."
46:36;46:41;"They couldn't win, so they'd be on these slot machines that would never pay them out cash."
46:41;46:43;"They'd pay them out in gift cards."
46:43;46:45;"They just loved the experience of gambling."
46:45;46:50;"You had people that were losing their life savings, and they were never winning anything."
46:50;46:52;"To win Walmart gift cards."
46:52;46:53;"To win Walmart gift cards."
46:53;46:56;"That was probably my biggest one. That took a while."
46:56;47:07;"It was how a lot of these places had been popping up and were essentially these giant legal loopholes from whatever low-key mafia."
47:07;47:09;"At the time, were you a little depressed?"
47:09;47:14;"Oh, yeah. I didn't know what I was going to do."
47:14;47:16;"Outside of this, I was like, ""This is fun."""
47:16;47:23;"Well, it got depressed because I'm living in my grandma's computer room, and my grandma's computer room in 2002 is never used."
47:23;47:25;"Wait, Nick. Sorry. What college did you go to?"
47:25;47:32;"I went to Columbia. I graduated in 2002, so Ezra and I just missed each other."
47:32;47:34;"Nick and I did not cross over at Columbia."
47:34;47:37;"It's so funny. I didn't even know you went there. We never talk about college."
47:37;47:40;"I was in English. No one ever asked."
47:40;47:41;"It just doesn't come up."
47:41;47:46;"We had some similar teachers. Ezra and I were professors, so Ezra and I would sometimes talk about it."
47:46;47:48;"We were both English majors."
47:48;47:53;"I really did think—so maybe that was the difference."
47:53;47:57;"At an early age, I sort of felt like I knew what I was going to do."
47:57;48:05;"It's not like I didn't have the same sort of fortitude or faith that Jake did."
48:05;48:11;"But I definitely, at this moment, was like, ""I thought I really had a plan,"" and that plan fell apart."
48:11;48:17;"Then my grandma kicked me out of the house because she was basically just telling me that I was too difficult to live with."
48:17;48:20;"Your grandma finally got into computers."
48:20;48:26;"She was like, ""I finally figured out this email, and I've got to get into this room."""
48:26;48:30;"At first, she was like, ""Nick, you stay in the computer room. I never use that thing."""
48:30;48:36;"Then she's like, ""You know what, Nick? There's actually some really cool s--- happening on the Internet right now. Get the s--- out."
48:36;48:39;"I'm going to be up in the computer room a lot."""
48:39;48:43;"I go to bed real early."
48:43;48:48;"Everybody thinks it's strange."
48:48;48:52;"I get up early in the morning."
48:52;48:57;"No matter how disappointed I was with the day before, it feels new."
49:05;49:09;"I don't leave the house much."
49:09;49:14;"I don't like being around people."
49:14;49:18;"Makes me nervous and weird."
49:18;49:22;"I don't like going to shows either."
49:22;49:26;"It's better for me to stay home."
49:26;49:31;"Some might think it means I hate people."
49:31;49:39;"But that's not quite right."
49:39;49:44;"I do some stupid things."
49:44;49:48;"But my heart's in the right place. And this I know."
49:48;49:52;"It's funny. Maybe I just am thinking about it right now. I never really put it together."
49:52;49:57;"Basically, she kicks me out. My friend kicked me out."
49:57;50:02;"We're not really talking much anymore."
50:02;50:07;"I have nowhere to go."
50:07;50:12;"I know I can move back home with my parents. I know I could."
50:12;50:17;"I really don't want to. But that was never not an option."
50:17;50:22;"I was in my brother's dorm room."
50:22;50:27;"He shared a flop house with six dudes."
50:27;50:32;"He was graduating. When I was up there, they were all watching Adult Swim."
50:32;50:37;"All the time. I was like, I'm going to write a story. I'm going to pitch this."
50:37;50:42;"No one knows what Adult Swim is. That was what got me the job."
50:42;50:47;"I wrote a piece about Adult Swim for the Broward County weekly."
50:47;50:52;"I left Florida. My grandma kicked me out."
50:52;50:57;"I couldn't afford to live anywhere."
50:57;51:02;"I went to Boston, stayed with my brother, and then started pitching while I was up there."
51:02;51:07;"I started pitching around."
51:07;51:12;"I bought this story. There's a thing called Adult Swim. No one knows about it, yet it's really popular."
51:12;51:17;"Why are young men watching Adult Swim?"
51:17;51:22;"I pitched that. I went to Atlanta. I had a small window where I moved back home."
51:22;51:27;"Maybe a month."
51:27;51:32;"When I was doing the interview, the story on Adult Swim, the guy that was the head of it,"
51:32;51:37;"this guy Mike Lazo, who we've talked about, he hired me while I was interviewing him."
51:37;51:42;"He said, ""Do you want to come here and work for me?"""
51:42;51:47;"Honestly, there's not much more to it."
51:47;51:52;"He's an interesting dude who never graduated high school, yet was a Faulkner."
51:52;51:57;"He collected Faulkner first editions. I was a Faulkner studies major at Columbia."
51:57;52:02;"I talked to him about Faulkner."
52:02;52:07;"He was really misanthropic. Never really met anybody."
52:07;52:12;"He was like, ""Do you want to come move to Atlanta and work with me?"""
52:12;52:17;"That was 2003?"
52:17;52:22;"That story still feels so 20th century."
52:22;52:27;"Did you say he was a high school dropout?"
52:27;52:32;"His story is so good. That is what the Esquire story ultimately would have been if I hadn't taken this job."
52:32;52:37;"This dude doesn't graduate high school, gets a job working for Turner"
52:37;52:42;"when it's truly just WWE and the early cable."
52:42;52:47;"He's a male guy and he's delivering mail to Ted Turner."
52:47;52:52;"Literally giving Ted Turner the mail from the bottom floor."
52:52;52:57;"When Ted Turner is like, ""Oh, you seem like a smart guy. Do you want a little more responsibility?"""
52:57;53:02;"Then ultimately he's like, ""I just bought the Warner Brothers catalog. I'm going to start Cartoon Network."
53:02;53:07;"Do you want to work for this new channel that's essentially just reruns of Warner Brothers TV shows?"""
53:07;53:12;"He then starts. He's like, ""Actually, we can start a new channel."
53:12;53:17;"We can make some."""
53:17;53:22;"He starts making Dexter's Laboratory and Powerpuff Girls."
53:22;53:27;"Then he becomes the head of Cartoon Network."
53:27;53:32;"It's a true 20th century."
53:32;53:37;"He becomes the head of the company from the mail room."
53:37;53:42;"He's like, ""Oh, you seem like an interesting guy. Oh, you're a Faulkner fan?"
53:42;53:47;"Why don't you come work for me?"""
53:47;53:52;"Never asked me where I went to college."
53:52;53:57;"Never asked me what my previous experience was."
53:57;54:02;"I really didn't have a lot of other options."
54:02;54:07;"I was like, ""I'm going to start a white shoe law firm, but it's some little scrappy startup."
54:07;54:12;"That'll still happen, I think."""
54:12;54:17;"I think what's interesting about this is that in both cases, Mike Lazo getting hired by Ted Turner,"
54:17;54:22;"then you getting hired by Ted Turner, it was just people looking at somebody and being like,"
54:22;54:27;"""You seem like a smart guy. Come work for me,"" even with no experience."
54:27;54:32;"Part of the reason is that nobody has any control over doing anything anymore."
54:32;54:37;"At least in the business that I'm in, there's no one who goes rogue or renegade."
54:37;54:42;"The way I was hired, I remember very vividly."
54:42;54:47;"I went out for my last interview."
54:47;54:52;"I spent four days embedded at Adult Swim."
54:52;54:57;"I was like, ""I'm going to write this article, and then hopefully it's successful,"
54:57;55:02;"and I get to write another. Then I can basically not live with my parents."""
55:02;55:07;"He was like, ""No, I mean, you want to come work here in real time?"""
55:07;55:12;"I was like, ""I don't think so. I can't imagine moving to Atlanta."""
55:12;55:17;"I fly back home, and he calls me. He's like, ""I talked to HR, and there's a position for you."""
55:17;55:22;"I don't see that kind of thing, at least in my business."
55:22;55:27;"I don't even see someone that could hire somebody anymore without talking to other people."
55:27;55:32;"I love those old-school stories where it is just somebody's like,"
55:32;55:37;"""Yeah, and then I was pretty broke, so I got this job working at this lighting warehouse."
55:37;55:42;"Then one of the guys we supplied to, we just struck up a conversation one day,"
55:42;55:49;"and blah, blah, blah."" That's how I became the head curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."
55:49;55:51;"There's old-school--"
55:51;55:57;"It's a real Richard Montanez story."
55:57;56:04;"I think also now it's classic. It's like the destruction of the middle class or whatever."
56:04;56:07;"It's like the middle of jobs kind of dropped out."
56:07;56:16;"Either you're this super type A, gunning for the best positions in the corporate world,"
56:16;56:20;"like, ""I want to work as a product manager at Facebook,"" kind of thing,"
56:20;56:23;"or you're working minimum wage."
56:23;56:28;"These kind of funny middle things where there's small businesses where somebody's like,"
56:28;56:31;"""Yeah, I was working for this guy, and I kind of just--"""
56:31;56:35;"That's how I started to understand the dry cleaning business."
56:35;56:38;"I saved up to buy my first one, and then that made me--"
56:38;56:42;"You just-- I don't know. I'm sad. I miss it."

01:08:19;01:08:21;"Was it your wife's favorite film of 2023?"

01:09:35;01:09:38;"And of course, it's a movie, so it's well-made,"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"and it has an artsy pace,"
01:09:41;01:09:45;"and it's about a guy who cleans toilets in Japan."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"Wait, sorry. Is it a doc or a feature film?"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"It's a feature film."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"Oh, it's acting. Okay, so I trust it even less."
01:09:52;01:09:57;"Yeah, like, fiction can reveal reality more than doc sometimes."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"But here's the thing. It's about the guy."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"I think what he's saying is it's not even just with the film."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"Just to be clear, it's not my understanding,"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"having not seen my wife's favorite movie,"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"is that it's not just about what the film's about."
01:10:07;01:10:13;"It's the actual presentation is particularly measured and beautiful."
01:10:13;01:10:17;"It's aesthetically pleasing, but also, because it's slow,"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"you can tell he's really trying to give you the texture"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"and the pace of this guy's life."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"A guy who gets up early, gets in his van,"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"he plays cassette tapes of music that he loves,"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"cleans toilets all day."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"You see he has, like, one day off a week,"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"and he goes to a bookstore and gets a new book"
01:10:36;01:10:40;"that he can read for, you know, 20 minutes a night before he passes out."
01:10:40;01:10:43;"And he goes and has a little dinner, and then it's back to work."
01:10:43;01:10:46;"And, you know, the movie, also, there's these little cracks"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"where you kind of start to see, like,"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"""Oh, interesting, is this guy running from some painful past or something?"""
01:10:51;01:10:54;"Oh, side note, Ezra, sorry to interrupt,"
01:10:54;01:10:58;"but it's also Faulkner who he's reading in the film,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"if I'm not mistaken. Isn't that right?"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Yeah, right. At some point, he's reading Faulkner."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"You can tell he's, like-- the character is into American stuff."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"He's reading, like, American books in translation,"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"and he's playing-- it's called ""Perfect Days"""
01:11:10;01:11:12;"because he's always playing tapes in the car,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"including, like, Lou Reed, ""Perfect Day."""
01:11:14;01:11:17;"And so, you know, maybe at the end, it's an interesting movie"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"because you're questioning, ""Is this guy satisfied?"""
01:11:20;01:11:23;"There's just these handful of moments where you see, like,"
01:11:23;01:11:26;"""Oh, maybe there's some difficulties in his family."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"Maybe he's not completely settled"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"with some of the relationships he had in his life."""
01:11:32;01:11:35;"But there's something about a movie like that--"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"and I think there's a million examples of it--"
01:11:37;01:11:42;"where you're watching somebody have a very simple life,"
01:11:42;01:11:45;"working a job that I guess you could call--"
01:11:45;01:11:48;"I mean, cleaning toilets could be a little bit gross."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"Certainly, it's not prestigious, right?"
01:11:51;01:11:55;"It's not a high-status job where people are, you know,"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"saying, ""Wow, look at that. Look at what you do."""
01:11:58;01:12:01;"And yet, sometimes you watch a movie like that,"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"and maybe that is a good thing about movies,"
01:12:03;01:12:08;"is providing the aesthetic lens to appreciate everything,"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"not just, like, the shiny jobs or something."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"And I do feel like, whether we're talking about a movie"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"or just reminiscing and talking about, like, you know,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"like Nick, your story, living in Grandma's computer room"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"in Fort Lauderdale, unclear where your life is heading,"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"trying your hand at investigative journalism,"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"not sure where that's going."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"Looking back, that sounds like a really, like--"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"could be, like, a very beautiful time in your life"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"or something that, you know, if somebody said,"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"""You want to throw on a VR headset right now"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"and you want to port into that experience"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"for, like, a couple weeks?"""
01:12:44;01:12:46;"I'd be like, ""Yeah, that's kind of, like, vibey"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"and interesting. I want to see what that's like."""
01:12:48;01:12:50;"But, you know, I understand that."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"But at the time, these things--"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"when you have a lot of anxiety about the future,"
01:12:55;01:13:00;"it's harder to appreciate how vibey or some jobs could be"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"and some experiences could be."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"I mean, in the movie, does he have, like, a family"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"or anything or, like, a relationship?"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"No, that's the other thing. It's like, it's a very--"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"he has a very lonesome existence"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"or a very solitary existence."
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Yeah, I mean, I think it's-- you can romanticize that,"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"and then I think you do part two of ""Perfect Days,"""
01:13:18;01:13:21;"and it's 20 years later, and he's still single,"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"and he's submitted all his short stories"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"to the cool journals in Japan that don't publish his work,"
01:13:28;01:13:31;"and he's bitter, and he's depressed."
01:13:31;01:13:35;"I think it'd be tough to be without a partnership"
01:13:35;01:13:39;"or a family or a job that means anything to you"
01:13:39;01:13:42;"and maintain this, like, Zen Buddhist outlook."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Although--but it's funny--"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"You can go for a while if you're working towards something."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"It is the epitome of Zen, you know?"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Yep."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"And maybe that's the irony."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"It's like--and maybe also it's partially about, like,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"when you end up in a situation like that,"
01:13:56;01:13:59;"you can either-- if there's a part of your brain saying,"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"""No, this is not where you're supposed to be,"""
01:14:01;01:14:03;"you're gonna suffer, and if there's a part of you"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"that says, ""You know what? This is cool."""
01:14:05;01:14:07;"I mean, like, obviously, even what little I understand"
01:14:07;01:14:11;"about Zen is, like, developed by monks"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"who chopped wood and carried water,"
01:14:13;01:14:16;"lived, like, the most simplest life."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"No wives or girlfriends, no movies,"
01:14:19;01:14:24;"no, like, constant stimulation from, like, you know,"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"new experiences or novelty."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"No iPad."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"What if early Zen monks have iPad?"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"I mean, yeah, I mean, like, the texture of life"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"hundreds of years ago is completely different"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"from how it is now, so..."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"I think it'd be easier to pull that off back then."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"The last thing I'll say is, like, you know how"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"when you're in another country and you do some"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"regular degular stuff, like, go to the gas station,"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"go to the supermarket, it's pretty interesting?"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Dude, yeah."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"No, when I moved to L.A., man, I was so psyched to be here."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Like, even sitting in traffic, I was like,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"""Oh, yeah, this rules."""
01:15:01;01:15:03;"And it wears off eventually."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Right. I guess that's what you got to keep alive."
01:15:05;01:15:08;"No, yeah, I mean, look, as a visual artist,"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"I strive to do that every day."
01:15:10;01:15:14;"You want to be alert to all of the possibilities"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"and, like, you know, chance poetry"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"that's unfolding before you, but sometimes it's hard."
01:15:19;01:15:22;"What about our perfect day, which is Jake"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"driving from, like, the Glendale, like, shopping."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"It opens with him shopping in this, maybe,"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"the Glendale Home Depot, and then getting in his car"
01:15:31;01:15:34;"and driving, and it's mainly, you know, to his job"
01:15:34;01:15:37;"across town on the west side, you know, to a gallery,"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"and it's just mainly him and his car in L.A."
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Just having a great day, just feeling..."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"Listening to Guided by Voices."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"Oh, absolutely. 1992's Propeller, let's go."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"I got 40 minutes to get down to Culver City."

01:16:44;01:16:46;"obviously, you have a passion in life,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"you have something you're really good at,"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"you've doggedly pursued it,"

01:17:02;01:17:05;"some other kind of life or job or something?"
01:17:05;01:17:10;"No. I'm very thankful that I can do what I do."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"Okay, Jake maintains his privacy."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"Wait, we gotta..."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Keeps it tight."

01:17:18;01:17:20;"I don't know what else I would possibly do."
01:17:20;01:17:23;"I'm always just thinking about, like, you know what?"
01:17:23;01:17:27;"The level of satisfaction and sort of freedom"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"and all that, you know, I just..."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"There's been times in my life where,"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"like, there's been plenty of times in my life"
01:17:35;01:17:42;"where I wondered if I would ultimately be calmer,"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"happier, and maybe even closer to understanding"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"the nature of reality if I worked at, like,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"a little sandwich shop."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"And to be fair, I picture it being kind of, like,"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"a cute little sandwich shop."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"I'm not picturing, like..."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"Not Quiznos."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"You're not a sandwich artist at Subway."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"Which is your... Isn't that your other real job?"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Yeah, for a week I worked at Quiznos,"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"but even that was kind of cool."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Like, when I look back on that,"
01:18:03;01:18:07;"it was Montclair, New Jersey, 2000s."
01:18:07;01:18:09;"I guess I'm saying, like, if you were just, like,"
01:18:09;01:18:12;"you're gonna work at, like, this really"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"kind of depressing Subway,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"like, this, like, regional airport"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"where the vibes are just terrible."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Yeah, that's not what I'm picturing."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"I guess I'm still picturing something kind of, like,"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"cute, maybe even, like, Japanese."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Yeah."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Like, where you have, like, the guy who runs"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"a little place all by himself, or the woman,"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"and they're making the coffee by hand,"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"and, you know, they have the..."
01:18:32;01:18:36;"I will say, I feel like you are articulating"
01:18:36;01:18:40;"sort of a shared millennial escapist fantasy"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"that a lot of people who work in the corporate world"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"often revert to, which is either that"
01:18:46;01:18:50;"we're living off the land, or in some sort of commune,"
01:18:50;01:18:53;"or some sort of agricultural fantasy."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"I feel like there are, like, three archetypes of, like,"
01:18:56;01:19:01;"what is the simple, organic kind of life"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"that I could be living as an alternative?"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"I feel like you've just spoken about one of them,"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"even coming from, you know, an exciting..."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"a career that you may..."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"normally people may not want to escape from."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Yeah. Right."
01:19:15;01:19:17;"I've never had, like, a brutal corporate job."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"And no, I don't want to escape from the dubs."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"You know, and I guess also, though, it's like,"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"it's about... and this is where all these, like,"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"fantasies and imagining alternate lives get weird,"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"is, like, yeah, of course, life is..."
01:19:29;01:19:33;"it would be very challenging to live a life totally alone."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"If you had... you had no friends, no family,"
01:19:36;01:19:39;"no partner, none of that stuff,"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"I don't really know what that would be like."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"If I've had moments in my life"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"where I almost felt like I got a glimpse of it,"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"yeah, it was scary to me."
01:19:48;01:19:52;"But if you told me I'd more or less have the same people in my life,"
01:19:52;01:19:55;"and I'd, you know, I'd come home to the same people,"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"and on the weekends I'd see the same friends and stuff,"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"you said, ""But..."""
01:19:58;01:20:00;"No, you're making sandwiches."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"You're making sandwiches?"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"I really wouldn't be freaked out about that."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"You guys don't agree?"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Oh, I mean, totally."
01:20:08;01:20:12;"If you told me that I could just be a barista"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"at some kind of small artisanal coffee shop"
01:20:15;01:20:18;"and live more or less the same way that I live,"
01:20:18;01:20:19;"absolutely."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"I think you're both coming at it from the perspective of accomplishment,"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"because you've..."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Yeah."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"I don't buy this."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"I just don't buy this worldview at all."
01:20:28;01:20:32;"No, I think it's true now that you've done great things,"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"but I think that if you had not achieved those things,"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"you wouldn't feel the same way."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Right."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"But I guess there's two ways of looking at it."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"One is--and of course, I've thought about all this stuff before."
01:20:42;01:20:46;"You can say when someone's had some success"
01:20:46;01:20:50;"or, you know, made it to some extent in the industry they want to make it in,"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"especially something like showbiz,"
01:20:52;01:20:57;"which is famously a lot of people tie their dreams up in showbiz."
01:20:57;01:21:01;"So if you ever get to do it at any level that you can call successfully,"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"understandably, you've got to kick the tires on that,"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"because it's rare."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"The one way to look at it is, you know,"
01:21:09;01:21:13;"it's easy for you to say when you've had success,"
01:21:13;01:21:17;"because you got that thing that everybody wanted."
01:21:17;01:21:20;"You can have that feather in the cap for the rest of your life,"
01:21:20;01:21:23;"and you go work at the sandwich shop, and it's going to hit different."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Of course, I understand that perspective."
01:21:25;01:21:29;"The other way to look at it is if you've had some success"
01:21:29;01:21:33;"and you realize, like, right, that's not what true success is."
01:21:33;01:21:38;"True success is knowing how to enjoy every day,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"whether you have good news that day or bad news that day,"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"and how to live in the moment and all the clichés and stuff."
01:21:44;01:21:49;"Then you could say, ""I'm thankful to success for what it's provided me,"
01:21:49;01:21:53;"but most of all I'm thankful that it makes me less scared"
01:21:53;01:21:57;"of, you know, going back to jobs I used to have."""
01:21:57;01:22:00;"You know what I mean? It's a subtle difference."
01:22:00;01:22:03;"And maybe everybody just needs to figure it out for themselves."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Like, maybe that is the best part of success,"
01:22:05;01:22:09;"is that if you're lucky, it makes you realize, like,"
01:22:09;01:22:14;"that the success itself is not quite as important as you'd imagined."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"And by the way, I'm not comparing, I'm not talking about"
01:22:17;01:22:21;"if you have no health insurance and terrible health problems,"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"and you're stressing about money and health care every day."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"That's a very unique category."
01:22:26;01:22:30;"What I'm talking about is more like being an embittered,"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"you know, 35-year-old 8th grade teacher,"
01:22:33;01:22:36;"which is a really actually meaningful job."
01:22:36;01:22:40;"And the pay is decent, and you get the summers off, as discussed."
01:22:40;01:22:41;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"You get like six weeks off."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"You know, I think this..."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"I read this thing, and because TC is getting..."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"It's entering its middle age."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"I did, and I've never been able to find this article,"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"but some Apple news thing surfaced to me a few years ago,"
01:22:57;01:23:00;"saying I kind of haven't been able to forget, yet I cannot find it,"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"which was some kind of..."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"It seems like a click-baity thing,"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"and it was like how to avoid a midlife crisis."
01:23:07;01:23:10;"So, you know, some click on it."
01:23:10;01:23:14;"And the heart of it was that for your, like, first part of your life,"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"you know, the first half, it's all about accumulation."
01:23:17;01:23:20;"It's about achievement and trying to..."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"It's about collecting things, whether it's knowledge, friends,"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"accomplishments, whatever."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"It's about growth, right?"
01:23:29;01:23:32;"And then the second half of your life is about shedding,"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"and you have to, like, get rid of all this stuff."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"Like, you found what it is in all of that sort of accumulation"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"and not giving the things that make you happy,"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"the things that you're comfortable with,"
01:23:42;01:23:46;"and you have to then start spending the sort of second part of your life"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"shedding those to get back down to, like,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"now that you know what makes you happy, right?"
01:23:50;01:23:54;"And the people that have a midlife crisis are often the people that don't do that."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"And they're the people that spend that second half"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"still trying to, like, collect things,"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"still trying to achieve things, still trying to, like..."
01:24:00;01:24:01;"You know what I mean?"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"Like, more..."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"Like, keep that similar kind of ambition,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"and that is not..."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"You haven't learned the goal,"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"and that's where you see sort of people who are, like, unhappy."
01:24:12;01:24:17;"And that is sort of whether you call it a sandwich shop, a bar,"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"I think that's sort of what we're..."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"That's the version of what we're saying is, like,"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"there's a certain amount of, like, ""Oh, sh*t."""
01:24:23;01:24:26;"There's, like, whatever accomplishments you have,"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"at some point you realize, ""All right, it's, like, now time to, like,"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"sort of strip back down."""
01:24:30;01:24:33;"That's what I'm hearing in it, and I do..."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"I do think that that's right."
01:24:35;01:24:39;"And I understand sort of youthful ambition, right?"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"And there's a point where you go, ""All right, well, now,"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"either I've done it or not done it, but whatever I have,"
01:24:44;01:24:47;"I have to now go, 'All right, I got X amount of time left,"
01:24:47;01:24:50;"and happiness is going to come from, you know,"
01:24:50;01:24:54;"understanding what that brought me and what do I want to keep.'"""
01:24:54;01:24:55;"You know?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Yeah."
01:24:56;01:25:00;"No, it's about appreciating simplicity."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"And I guess that's something that everybody eventually needs to do."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"Whatever..."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"Whether you're in a job you like, a job you don't like,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"appreciating simplicity is..."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"That needs to enter your life at a certain point."
01:25:13;01:25:16;"Maybe you don't need it when you're in your 20s or even your 30s,"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"but, yeah, I agree."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"And, by the way, even what that article to me was saying is, like,"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"it's actually, like, you shouldn't even really have that at that period."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"You know?"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"And those are your 20s, 30s, maybe part of your 40s, whatever it is,"
01:25:28;01:25:31;"like, when you decide you've sort of reached that goal,"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"it's like you're actually supposed to."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"That is a time of, like, ""I'm just going to collect,"" you know?"
01:25:36;01:25:40;"It's like whatever it is, just things, you know, ideas, friends."
01:25:40;01:25:42;"You just grow, grow, grow, right?"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Like, that's where you're figuring it out."
01:25:44;01:25:48;"But it's untenable to continue that way, and it doesn't bring you that."
01:25:48;01:25:52;"It brings you to the point where then you go, ""Wow, I've had this variety."
01:25:52;01:25:55;"I understand what's working for me."""
01:25:55;01:26:00;"And I think also, you know, a huge part of why I think about these things,"
01:26:00;01:26:06;"whether I'm right or wrong or, you know, but also having had some success,"
01:26:06;01:26:11;"but even more importantly, having been around very successful people,"
01:26:11;01:26:15;"including people that are objectively more successful than me,"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"sometimes a lot more successful than me."
01:26:17;01:26:21;"You know, just like life working in showbiz."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"Jude Law. Jude Law."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"The Jude Laws of the world."
01:26:24;01:26:28;"No, not Jude Law, but all sorts of people, you know?"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"[laughter]"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"That's actually a really funny question."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"Is Jude Law objectively more successful than Ezra?"
01:26:35;01:26:36;"I would say no."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"Oh, definitely."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"No, I would say no. He's not more--he's more famous than you,"
01:26:41;01:26:45;"but within his field, he's a well-known, respected actor."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"Within your field?"
01:26:46;01:26:49;"Well-known, respected musician, songwriter."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"I mean--"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"That's a really funny--that's a really funny, like--"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"I'm giving it to Jude. I'm giving it to Jude."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"Okay. Well, of course you are. We're on the show. I mean, yeah."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Yeah, but--"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"Wait, out of the show, he's not giving it to Jude? I don't think--"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"No, no, I mean, give it to Jude. I don't care. Give it to Jude."
01:27:08;01:27:12;"I just thought of Jude because--I think we joked about this on the show"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"once we went to see Jack White and Jude Law."
01:27:14;01:27:17;"Jude Law did a voice on Neo Yokio."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"That's correct, yeah."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"And then he was backstage, and I met Jude Law,"
01:27:20;01:27:23;"and then I see--in my memory, he was very tall."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Is he tall? I actually can't remember."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Whatever. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"It just--that just popped--"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"We should have him on the show once sometime."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"That popped in."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"He's on the Vampire album."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"There's--oh, yeah, and we even did a collab."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"He's on a Japanese bonus track for Father of the Bride."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"I love that."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"What? Okay. Well, there you go."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"Ezra's new attitude is every guest, he goes, ""Objectively,"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"who's more successful, me or you?"""
01:27:46;01:27:49;"Actually, that reminds me of something that always pops into my mind"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"and cracks me up is that there's a student in my class named Frank,"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"and at some point, you know, like, some of the--"
01:27:56;01:27:59;"it could get really out of control, eighth grade classroom,"
01:27:59;01:28:02;"and at some point, he was, like, out of his desk with this piece of paper"
01:28:02;01:28:05;"running over to people, and I was like, ""What are you doing?"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Like, sit down."""
01:28:06;01:28:13;"And then I grabbed it, and basically, he had made a poll that was--"
01:28:13;01:28:17;"it was phrased, ""Who looks better, Frank or this other kid?"""
01:28:17;01:28:20;"And he was just going over to every kid in the class."
01:28:20;01:28:24;"I felt kind of bad, too, because these were obviously two kids"
01:28:24;01:28:28;"who probably neither one of them felt like they were that good-looking,"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"but it seemed like it was probably one of those things where they were fired up,"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"like, ""No, there's no way I'm as ugly as you."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"Who looks better, me or this?"""
01:28:36;01:28:38;"It's like coming from a positive place."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Yeah, it was kind of coming from a negative place,"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"but I still think about that, just like, ""Who looks better?"""

01:29:34;01:29:36;"I can almost picture him. You know, they were--"
01:29:36;01:29:39;"It's not a fair question for me to ask."
01:29:39;01:29:47;"But I just remember being like, ""Bro, you gotta win the poll, lose the poll."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"You already played yourself."""
01:29:50;01:29:52;"You know?"
01:29:52;01:29:55;"It's like, ""Come on. Come on, man."""
01:29:55;01:29:58;"Anyway, I hope you're doing okay, Frank."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"Also, I remember at that school in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,"
01:30:01;01:30:06;"the kids would mercilessly tease him for being named Frank."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"They just thought Frank was the craziest name ever."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"It's old school."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"It was so old school that it was--"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"It's a classic."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"It is a classic, but now that I think about it,"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"I don't know any young people named Frank."
01:30:19;01:30:23;"No, it's a hard one because Francis is probably not that much better."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"Anyway, what I was saying before was just--"
01:30:27;01:30:30;"I think I've just seen--"
01:30:30;01:30:36;"As somebody who has had ambition at many times in my life"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"and who entered a field where you need ambition to kind of keep going,"
01:30:40;01:30:44;"or certainly some form of ambition was my fuel"
01:30:44;01:30:48;"in the crazy early days of 2000s indie,"
01:30:48;01:30:52;"that when I started to encounter very successful people"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"or people who I'd admired or looked up to,"
01:30:54;01:30:58;"it was just interesting to me to realize how many--"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"This is maybe a cliched observation,"
01:31:01;01:31:07;"but just how many successful people are fundamentally dissatisfied."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"Also, maybe I saw signs of it in myself and said,"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"""Yeah, I'm kind of dissatisfied too."""
01:31:12;01:31:15;"There were times where I thought, ""Well, maybe dissatisfaction"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"is the artist's lot in life, right?"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Because what does an artist do?"
01:31:19;01:31:22;"An artist creates and says, ""No, that's not right. This is right."
01:31:22;01:31:25;"No, I'm not going to use that guitar tone."
01:31:25;01:31:28;"I'm going to use this one because I'm not going to settle"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"for something that doesn't feel quite right to me."""
01:31:30;01:31:32;"That is part of making art that you believe in,"
01:31:32;01:31:35;"is having a strong sense of dissatisfaction."
01:31:35;01:31:39;"If I hear a mix and it doesn't sound like how I imagined it,"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"I get like a pit in my stomach."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"I get a really negative feeling."
01:31:43;01:31:48;"Anyway, dissatisfaction I think is often part of the artist's lot in life."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"I started to think, ""Well, yeah, maybe it's good to be dissatisfied."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"What's the opposite of being dissatisfied?"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Like easily placated?"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"How are you going to make art that you believe in"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"if you just say, 'Yeah, that's good enough.'"""
01:32:00;01:32:02;"I was kind of like, ""Maybe it's good to be dissatisfied."""
01:32:02;01:32:07;"Then you'd see people who are kind of leaning into dissatisfaction"
01:32:07;01:32:15;"and you can see how that path leads to obviously unhappiness, madness,"
01:32:15;01:32:22;"just not a good thing and even can make the sweet smell of success kind of acrid."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"You see how right the--"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"Like we've joked about on the show,"
01:32:27;01:32:30;"all these people who make albums about like,"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"""Fame isn't all it's cracked up to be, man."""
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Everybody's like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever."""
01:32:34;01:32:39;"But clearly people suffer from success."
01:32:39;01:32:43;"DJ Khaled, I believe, titled an album, ""Suffering from Success,"""
01:32:43;01:32:45;"which I've always loved."
01:32:45;01:32:50;"So anyway, I guess my point is seeing that has also made me--"
01:32:50;01:32:54;"The older I get and I've seen people make different choices in life"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"and of course I know very satisfied, happy artists"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"and happy, successful people,"
01:32:59;01:33:03;"but I also know people who just have a certain je ne sais quoi,"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"a certain type of satisfied mind"
01:33:06;01:33:13;"who did not necessarily make it in some sort of like shiny career."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"And I just think the fact that I've seen both of those things"
01:33:16;01:33:21;"makes me think a lot about like, right, maybe like the--"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"And especially because my passion in life is chilling,"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"I think about like if you really love chilling,"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"chilling has to--"
01:33:28;01:33:31;"You have to know how to chill in every situation."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"You know what I mean?"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"I mean, I love it. I love that for you."
01:33:35;01:33:38;"It's very enlightened."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"I'm a workaholic."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Painters are workaholics."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"And why? Why is that?"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"It's something--"
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Is it just the nature of how your business functions?"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"Maybe."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"I mean, I just think things--"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"I mean, this is probably true of any art form."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"Things always take longer than you think they're going to take."
01:33:57;01:34:01;"The way you definitely have in mind ends up changing along the way."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"And it's really fun."
01:34:02;01:34:05;"It's very gratifying to be in the studio and working."
01:34:05;01:34:10;"And like five hours can just like go by in a blink of an eye."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"Right. And you feel good when you're painting."
01:34:13;01:34:18;"So even if somebody said to you, ""You crushed it this year."
01:34:18;01:34:20;"I think you should take two years off."
01:34:20;01:34:22;"Don't paint at all."
01:34:22;01:34:26;"Let the market get hungry and yeah, just really relax for two years."""
01:34:26;01:34:27;"That's not appealing to you."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"I don't know what I would do."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"First of all, I would never think about the market."
01:34:31;01:34:37;"But secondly, I just don't know what I would do with my days."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"And maybe that's like a problem."
01:34:38;01:34:42;"Maybe if I was sitting in the therapist chair, they'd be like, ""Well, that's a problem."""
01:34:42;01:34:44;"Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"No, I'm not going to watch those."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"I'm not going to read those."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"No?"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"Well, because if you watched all of them, that's a day right there."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"That's a day."
01:34:52;01:34:58;"All the Star Wars TV shows on Disney+ so you can catch up on those."
01:34:58;01:35:03;"Watching TV during the day is one of the most depressing things I can imagine."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"Oh, damn."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"Do you ever go to the movies during the day?"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Rarely, and it's a treat."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"You walk out, it's still daylight."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I hate that. I hate that."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"I like that."
01:35:13;01:35:18;"Going to like Mission Impossible 7 or whatever, and it's like a 12.30 screening."
01:35:18;01:35:22;"You walk out at like 3, and it's like, ""Oh my god, blinding light."""
01:35:22;01:35:29;"You really have a passion, and you're good at something, and what you do, I'm sure you feel relaxed."
01:35:29;01:35:33;"I mean, I'm sure you're stressed when you're under a deadline, but when you're just sitting there painting,"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"I'm sure you feel relaxed, you feel peaceful."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"It's where you're supposed to be."
01:35:37;01:35:42;"So it would be disingenuous for me to say, ""You know what, man?"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"That workaholism is f***ed up."
01:35:44;01:35:47;"You should be get okay with watching TV all day."""
01:35:47;01:35:51;"I don't feel relaxed or peaceful, but I feel engaged."
01:35:51;01:35:57;"Doesn't it feel so-- it tracks so well that Ezra's passion in life is chilling,"
01:35:57;01:36:01;"and chilling is Jake's nightmare."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"It's perfect."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"I like chilling at the end of the day."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"And yet you're a chill dude."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"With loved ones. Yeah, I try to be a chill dude."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"I think I am a chill dude."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"There's a difference between a chill at the end of a very long work--"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"It's almost not chilling then."
01:36:16;01:36:20;"It's almost like it's recovery unwinding."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"I love to unwind. I don't like to chill."
01:36:22;01:36:26;"That's a great parsing of the terms, Nick."
01:36:26;01:36:32;"I like to unwind, have a drink with the loved ones, maybe watch a film program,"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"go to dinner, talk with people, whatever."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"I don't like to go to bed early."
01:36:36;01:36:39;"I like to go to bed late and then get up early and then feel tired."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"That's my role."
01:36:41;01:36:46;"laughs"
01:36:46;01:36:50;"Over my"
01:36:50;01:36:58;"Over my dead body"
01:36:58;01:37:06;"Something big is gonna happen"
01:37:06;01:37:18;"Over my dead body"
01:37:18;01:37:26;"Some sort of storm's gonna come"
01:37:26;01:37:34;"Over my dead body"
01:37:34;01:37:41;"This is how I end up sucked in"
01:37:41;01:37:49;"Over my dead body"
01:37:49;01:37:52;"Some sort of sleep"
01:37:52;01:37:59;"And this one's all over me"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"I think Jigweed you're hitting on is very real,"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"and it's purpose is important in life."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"And I think having a sense of purpose,"
01:38:08;01:38:15;"moments in my life where I felt no sense of purpose were difficult for sure."
01:38:15;01:38:20;"And having a vampire weekend and always--"
01:38:20;01:38:25;"I guess in a sense I'm lucky because I can always think about the next album."
01:38:25;01:38:30;"I can--as aimless as my time might get,"
01:38:30;01:38:33;"I always have the next album to at least think about."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"Even--it's an imaginary point on the horizon,"
01:38:36;01:38:41;"and that probably makes me feel a bit more at home in the world."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"Of course."
01:38:42;01:38:46;"Whereas if that didn't exist, I might feel fully out to sea."
01:38:46;01:38:50;"But I guess the thing that I've had to learn, whatever,"
01:38:50;01:38:55;"I guess in my 30s, in my early 40s, which has been two months,"
01:38:55;01:38:59;"one month, is also like--"
01:38:59;01:39:00;"a sense of purpose is important."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"So when you don't have a lot going on,"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"how can you imbue chilling with a sense of purpose?"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"And to me that's the trick."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"It's not like, ""Oh yeah, have no sense of purpose."""
01:39:11;01:39:15;"It's almost like finding the little things that give life a sense of purpose,"
01:39:15;01:39:19;"which for me I realize it can sometimes be as simple as being like,"
01:39:19;01:39:23;"""I'm going to walk a lot today and move my body, and I'm going to--"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Cook dinner. Yeah."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Cook dinner, and I'm going to--"
01:39:26;01:39:29;"And maybe that's why something like working at the sandwich shop is appealing"
01:39:29;01:39:32;"because obviously I'm not sitting here being like,"
01:39:32;01:39:36;"""You know what? Do you guys ever fantasize about working a very high-risk,"
01:39:36;01:39:42;"arduous, mind-numbingly boring, dangerous job involving physical labor?"""
01:39:42;01:39:46;"Obviously I'm not saying that, although I do--"
01:39:46;01:39:49;"If that's your lot in life, you've got to find the vibe in that."
01:39:49;01:39:54;"But there is something about the simple, gentle, repetitive stuff,"
01:39:54;01:40:00;"like making a sandwich, that's appealing because that is just knowing how to vibe."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"And not--"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"But chilling can be a part of the process too."
01:40:04;01:40:11;"I feel like as a creative person you need that gestational absorption type of time"
01:40:11;01:40:17;"to get inspiration and to--"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"Jake, I don't know. Maybe it's different with your medium,"
01:40:20;01:40:29;"but don't you find that you need to pause to reinvigorate yourself?"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Or you're just-- You're able to just--"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"No, I mean you have to go out and see the world."
01:40:34;01:40:37;"It's like-- I just can't be in my studio every day."
01:40:37;01:40:41;"I have to go out and find new stuff and see stuff and--"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Pound the pavement in Dallas."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"Yeah, pound the pavement in Dallas before I go to Austin for--"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"That's like a form of chilling."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Yeah. No, it's like an invigorated form of chilling."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"Well, and you know, the truth is-- I also want to be clear."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"I'm not remotely criticizing your lifestyle."
01:40:56;01:41:00;"In fact, if anything, I think there's been times because I've known you so long"
01:41:00;01:41:04;"where I looked at what you do and I said, ""You know what? I wish I had that."""
01:41:04;01:41:09;"Because the nature of your relationship to painting is just not my relationship to music."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"I remember you came to my studio years ago and you were like,"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"""So you just post up on a painting for like five hours?"""
01:41:15;01:41:20;"I was like, ""Yeah."" You were just like, ""Whoa."""
01:41:20;01:41:22;"You know, that was like crazy."
01:41:22;01:41:25;"But I thought it was cool because just for me,"
01:41:25;01:41:29;"the music is more like little bursts of inspiration."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"I've just never been somebody who--"
01:41:31;01:41:34;"Like for instance, I have a little tiny little studio."
01:41:34;01:41:39;"I've never been somebody who wanted to have my own studio at home."
01:41:39;01:41:44;"I like to have a little room, have a piano in the house,"
01:41:44;01:41:47;"a little laptop if the spirit moves me, mess around a bit."
01:41:47;01:41:51;"I have guitars around, but I never felt the need"
01:41:51;01:41:55;"and partially because I've been lucky to work with amazing producers in my life."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"But I also just never-- And there's times where I said,"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"""Yeah, I should probably-- I could probably get--"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"I bet we could probably get albums done more if I--"
01:42:01;01:42:05;"When I write a song, I sketch out the demo a bit more."""
01:42:05;01:42:08;"And yet, I just never felt the need to have that"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"because that's just not how I work."
01:42:10;01:42:15;"When I see people who have a workspace and whose work and talent"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"takes them to that space for hours every day"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"and they feel good and comfortable in that place,"
01:42:20;01:42:23;"there's a part-- I really admire it, actually."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"That's just not my lot in life."
01:42:25;01:42:30;"So, I've had to imbue my passion for chilling with meaning."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Because if you just said to me,"
01:42:32;01:42:35;"""Do you wish you had a space where you could go,"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"have a sense of purpose every day and do your thing?"""
01:42:38;01:42:41;"I'd say, ""Yes."" And then they say, ""Well, you're a musician."
01:42:41;01:42:44;"Why don't you build a studio and make that your spot?"""
01:42:44;01:42:48;"And I'd be like, ""Because that's just not how my creativity has ever worked."""
01:42:48;01:42:49;"So, yeah, I really--"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"That's cool."
01:42:50;01:42:53;"So, for me, in a way, having a cute little sandwich shop"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"would almost be my imitation of your life, Jake."
01:42:56;01:42:59;"Right. The daily practice of--"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Instead of the daily practice of painting,"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"it's the daily practice of sandwich artistry."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"Yeah, exactly."
01:43:05;01:43:10;"Because you have this great thing that you can dissolve into"
01:43:10;01:43:14;"and you can be like-- watch five hours vanish."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Whereas when I work on music, it's just not the same."
01:43:16;01:43:22;"♪ You always go to the party ♪"
01:43:22;01:43:27;"♪ To pluck the feathers off all the birds ♪"

01:44:00;01:44:04;"Well, this episode was supposed to be about 2000s indie."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"I guess it was, in a way."
01:44:06;01:44:13;"It was about the lives of a bunch of independent individuals"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"who lived through the 2000s."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"Four men in their 40s."
01:44:17;01:44:22;"Four men in their 40s reminiscing about jobs"
01:44:22;01:44:25;"and vibing and chilling."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"On the next episode, we'll actually go deep on the music."
01:44:28;01:44:34;"This, hopefully, is a nice prologue for getting into it."
01:44:34;01:44:39;"And, yeah, I think we can actually talk about 2000s music"
01:44:39;01:44:43;"and what we were listening to and how that impacted us."
01:44:43;01:44:47;"Because I was starting to make a playlist going into this episode"
01:44:47;01:44:54;"and I realized that era, for me, 2000 until, let's say, 2006,"
01:44:54;01:45:00;"is very interesting because that really was, in a way, my coming of age."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"And it made me realize something."
01:45:01;01:45:05;"And I imagine we'll all talk about them a bit in our 2000s indie episode."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"But I kind of remember when The Strokes came out,"
01:45:08;01:45:11;"I think I was a senior in high school"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"because their first album came out on 9/11"
01:45:14;01:45:17;"and I was a senior in high school on 9/11."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"And I can actually vividly remember the TV"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"that I would go chill at my friend Wes's house."
01:45:22;01:45:27;"And I remember seeing the last night video on that TV in his TV room."
01:45:27;01:45:31;"And I also remember that was the same TV that we went and watched on 9/11"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"when they let us out from school early."
01:45:33;01:45:38;"And we watched World Trade Center 7 fall on that same TV."
01:45:38;01:45:43;"So, anyway, I always associate The Strokes with World Trade Center 7."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"Tower 7, bro."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Tower 7 is a sit."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"But anyway, I remember at the time being like,"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"I'm just across the river in Jersey."
01:45:51;01:45:54;"And I remember there was the football coach at my school was like,"
01:45:54;01:45:58;"""Oh, I remember some of those guys. I used to teach at Dwight."""
01:45:58;01:46:01;"A bunch of them went to that school in uptown in New York."
01:46:01;01:46:06;"So, they didn't feel that much older and they didn't feel a million miles away either."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"And so it's funny."
01:46:07;01:46:13;"That was like, whereas in the '90s and thinking about the music I'd listened to,"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"these people seemed so much older."
01:46:16;01:46:21;"Whereas by the time you're 17 and you're looking at a new band or something,"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"it just doesn't feel that far away."
01:46:22;01:46:28;"So, that was really this interesting moment of thinking about music."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"I don't want to say peers because that still wasn't the case."
01:46:32;01:46:38;"But that's an interesting transition when you start to imagine what they're doing."
01:46:38;01:46:42;"Is that something you could do with your friends versus,"
01:46:42;01:46:47;"even just a few years earlier when I'm like 14 listening to Radiohead,"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"maybe we might have imitated it, but that just seemed like another planet."
01:46:50;01:46:54;"So, yeah, the 2000s is really where my brain kind of started to come online"
01:46:54;01:46:58;"and think of these bands as like, I don't know."
01:46:58;01:47:05;"Yeah, just something, not peers, but also not like giants living on another planet either."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"That's so funny, man."
01:47:06;01:47:10;"That's the days between because that's when I tapped out."
01:47:10;01:47:13;"Tapped out in what? Like you were just like done caring?"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Yeah."
01:47:14;01:47:19;"Like I was really struggling to come up with music from the 2000s that I liked,"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"that I thought was any good."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"I like the Strokes. I like the Shins."
01:47:24;01:47:30;"But at that point I was, what was I? I guess 23 in 2000."
01:47:30;01:47:35;"I was like, at that point, starting to like go deep on like Springsteen, Neil Young,"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"like the old stuff."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"And I was like, I would hear these new bands and I'd be like--"
01:47:39;01:47:42;"You weren't into those Matador bands?"
01:47:42;01:47:43;"In the 90s?"
01:47:43;01:47:44;"No, but that's 90s."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Yeah, but no, but I feel like, I mean, but I understand--"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Bell and Sebastian? Yeah."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Yeah, Bell and Sebastian."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"But they came out, they started in the 90s."
01:47:51;01:47:52;"No, no."
01:47:52;01:47:57;"Right, like Jake, I bet, I imagine when like the first Arcade Fire album came out"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"and you probably knew some people were like, ""Oh, have you heard this new band?"""
01:47:59;01:48:01;"I bet you didn't give a f***."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"Absolutely not."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Right."
01:48:03;01:48:07;"Even the Strokes, I was like, ""Oh yeah, I mean Lou Reed, television, cool."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Been there, done that."""
01:48:09;01:48:11;"I was just like, ""Okay, I see."""
01:48:11;01:48:16;"Like, not that this was like a cool position, but that's just where I was."
01:48:16;01:48:20;"Where I was like, ""Oh, I see, I see what's happening."""
01:48:20;01:48:26;"I know the references these bands are doing, and they're not as good as the originals"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"from 20 years ago."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"Okay, you want to go straight to the source?"
01:48:29;01:48:34;"I also do think that there's a defining, like in a lot of the band, in the sound,"
01:48:34;01:48:38;"there's like a kind of, whether it's the Strokes to whatever the DFA stuff is,"
01:48:38;01:48:45;"like it does feel like there's like a Franz Ferdinand, a very DNC quality to it."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"I like that."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"That jig does not lie."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"No, but here's the thing."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"Here's the thing."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Exactly."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Can I say this though?"
01:48:51;01:48:55;"I did not like Belle and Sebastian when they came out."
01:48:55;01:48:58;"And I really like Belle and Sebastian now."
01:48:58;01:49:02;"At the time I was sort of like, I don't know, just more interested in older stuff."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"And I was like, ""You know what?"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"If this stuff's good, it'll rise to the surface and I'll come back to it."""
01:49:06;01:49:08;"I remember thinking that."
01:49:08;01:49:12;"And like, the Strokes singles are awesome."
01:49:12;01:49:15;"Do the Strokes make good records I want to throw on?"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"No."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Are their singles awesome?"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"They're like you too to me."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"They're like, ""Can't listen to a full record."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"The singles are unimpeachable."""
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Belle and Sebastian, the records are amazing all the way through."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"I love Belle and Sebastian now."
01:49:27;01:49:30;"But I had this feeling of like, ""I'll come back to it if it's good."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"And if it's not good, I don't care."
01:49:32;01:49:35;"I can't deal with this."""
01:49:35;01:49:36;"I don't know."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"Yeah, I feel you."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"And I used to like..."
01:49:39;01:49:42;"Yeah, and I think that's part of growing up too is being able to say that."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"Like, I don't have a strong opinion on this right now."
01:49:45;01:49:50;"And maybe I'm just at an age in my life where I need some context for it."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"You know, it's like the same way that I feel about sports."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"Like, I have my like vague team affiliations."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Like, I always have a soft spot for the Knicks."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"And like, you know, I like New York sports culture."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Sure."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"You know, my dad and my grandparents are from the Bronx."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Always kind of like the Yankees."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"But then Bayles Cousins on the Mets."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"So, I'm like, ""Oh, that's all right. I'll check out the Mets."""
01:50:10;01:50:14;"But broadly speaking, I kind of remember, Jake, you explaining a lot of this to me"
01:50:14;01:50:18;"during the World Series that was the Astros versus the Dodgers."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"You were giving me a lot of context for the players."
01:50:20;01:50:24;"And I just kind of realized like, yeah, when I'm like hanging with somebody"
01:50:24;01:50:29;"and they can like tell me players' back story, that's helpful"
01:50:29;01:50:34;"because I'm not going to be the dude all up on ESPN.com"
01:50:34;01:50:38;"listening to like three hours podcast every single day"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"talking about just like the offseason."
01:50:41;01:50:45;"And like, that's not where my attention is going."
01:50:45;01:50:48;"But given enough time and context, I can become really engaged"
01:50:48;01:50:51;"in a team or a player or a game."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"And I think the same thing is true with music."
01:50:53;01:50:57;"Like, maybe sometimes like new artists come out"
01:50:57;01:51:01;"and even ones that I can tell, I'm like, obviously, there's something special here."
01:51:01;01:51:05;"But part of me is kind of like waiting for the, like, who knows?"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"Like, maybe, I don't want to say a band because it might sound like I'm being dismissive"
01:51:08;01:51:12;"if I name some like beloved artist who I don't listen to."
01:51:12;01:51:16;"But like, I could totally imagine one day there'll be like a podcast"
01:51:16;01:51:21;"that's like walking through some 2000s era beloved artists"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"that I never really had time for."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"And something will click then."
01:51:25;01:51:29;"Because at that point, I'll enjoy hearing the story of how they got from album one"
01:51:29;01:51:34;"to album 10. And I'll go back and be like, right, I wasn't paying attention at the time."
01:51:34;01:51:38;"But again, I needed, sometimes you just need the context and you need the time."
01:51:38;01:51:41;"Some people are meant to be day one fans of something."
01:51:41;01:51:46;"And some people are meant to be like, you know, listening to the Joker men"
01:51:46;01:51:52;"that walks you through something with all the benefit of historical context."
01:51:52;01:51:56;"Yeah, with Belle and Sebastian at the time, I thought it was really twee."
01:51:56;01:52:02;"And I was, it was, I was adjacent and sort of friends with a lot of people"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"in a very incredibly twee music scene in Portland."
01:52:05;01:52:08;"And some of the bands were great. Some of them were not so great."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"And I just was like, I don't know, I just, it was a turn off."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"And then I've come back to their music in the last two years."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"And I'm like, this band is incredible."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"Maybe we got to just do a Belle and Sebastian episode."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"I would love to."
01:52:20;01:52:25;"Wait, are you listening? I imagine you're mostly listening to like the first three albums."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"Yeah, yeah. Boy with the Arab Strap and Tiger Milk."
01:52:28;01:52:34;"Yeah, yeah. Like the only the, yeah, exact late nineties into whatever, 2001, 2002."
01:52:34;01:52:39;"A lot of the music I researched, like that was like, oh, that's 2000s, right?"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"It was like, nope, that's 98. First page of the Lion record."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Oh, 98. Thought it was 2000."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"Well, I did some research too."
01:52:46;01:52:51;"And I did put a year 2000 Belle and Sebastian song on my playlist."
01:52:51;01:52:54;"So maybe that's what we should end with. Do you know this one, Jake?"
01:52:54;01:52:58;"This was like on an EP or maybe it was a single."
01:52:58;01:53:04;"The A side was called Jonathan David and the B side was called Take This Carriage Clock and Shove It."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Do you know this one? I don't think I know that."
01:53:06;01:53:10;"This is a great song. Actually, you put this on a mix, Ezra."
01:53:10;01:53:14;"Yeah. I think Death Spot or somebody had you do a mix and you included this."
01:53:14;01:53:18;"Oh yeah, I made like a mix for a Madea fashion brand."
01:53:18;01:53:22;"The thing I love about Belle and Sebastian though, it's not trying to be retro."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"It's not trying to be new. It's not trying to be the future."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"It's just somehow timeless."
01:53:27;01:53:49;"And you know when the kind of non-album tracks are this strong?"
01:53:49;01:53:55;"This wasn't even the A side of a non-album single. This is the B side of a non-album single."
01:53:55;01:54:01;"And also just like good storytelling. Maybe we should check out some of the later albums."
01:54:01;01:54:05;"I would love to. I know the first four very well."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"They had a pretty good single that came out a couple of years ago."
01:54:07;01:54:11;"I mean, they're still churning out some things that sound pretty good."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"Tip of the wine."
01:54:14;01:54:28;"I'm seeing, speaking of Belle and Sebastian, these are from Glasgow, right?"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Yeah."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"I'm seeing Teenage Fan Club tomorrow night."
01:54:31;01:54:37;"Oh, sick. And they're opening for the Vampire Weekend in Glasgow."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Teenage Fan Club is?"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Yeah."
01:54:41;01:54:46;"Wow. Yeah, I love Teenage Fan Club. I'm going to the Terragram tomorrow with my buddy Joel."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"Guys under 40 is going to see Teenage Fan Club."
01:54:49;01:54:54;"Oh, that's awesome. Jake, come out to Glasgow for the Teenage Fan Club Vampire Weekend show."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"You could build some art stuff around that."
01:54:56;01:54:59;"What's the back story there?"
01:54:59;01:55:06;"We enjoyed putting the US tour together so much and having a real variety of openers."
01:55:06;01:55:10;"Everything from Mike Gordon to the English Bee to Ra Ra Rai."
01:55:10;01:55:17;"Just stuff we had a personal connection to, whether as fans or actually personal."
01:55:17;01:55:24;"And so in our much shorter European tour, we're like, let's try to come up with some different things."
01:55:24;01:55:34;"We have a mix of artists, some younger artists and a sick, I don't know if you know this amazing UK 80s band,"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"China Crisis is opening some shows in London."
01:55:37;01:55:44;"I think we were just talking with everybody, the booking agent, about maybe in some places we should get some legends"
01:55:44;01:55:48;"who might want to open. And somebody's like, what about Teenage Fan Club in Glasgow?"
01:55:48;01:55:52;"And I was like, you think they'd do it? And let's ask. It's that kind of thing."
01:55:52;01:55:56;"So they're doing it? That's so amazing. How long are they going to play for?"
01:55:56;01:56:00;"I have no idea. I mean, this is way..."
01:56:00;01:56:05;"I don't care if you cry, just please leave me alone."
01:56:05;01:56:10;"I know this means nothing to you, but you got to say, hey, Norman,"
01:56:10;01:56:18;"Norman Blake, one of the main songwriters, I hosted an inter-radio show."
01:56:18;01:56:25;"One of my co-hosts, huge fan. There's nothing cool for you to say, but I don't know."
01:56:25;01:56:28;"No, I mean, I'm a fan too, but maybe not as deep as you."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"I mean, I'll... Yeah, it'll..."
01:56:30;01:56:34;"You know what? I have a Teenage Fan Club playlist on my phone."
01:56:34;01:56:38;"I'm just going to send it to Matt and it's going to be the new TC playlist."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Okay, sick. All right."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"And you know what? After the next episode, we should combine all our playlists"
01:56:43;01:56:49;"and make a Time Crisis 2000s, 2000 to 2005."
01:56:49;01:56:55;"We got a lot of work to do. We got to do a 2000 to 2005 music rundown."
01:56:55;01:56:59;"We got to do a Teenage Fan Club. Maybe we'll do a Scottish episode"
01:56:59;01:57:02;"where we do half Teenage Fan Club, half Belle and Sebastian."
01:57:02;01:57:07;"A little orange juice too. Let's go out on Teenage Fan Club start again."
01:57:07;01:57:11;"From the 1997 album, Songs from Northern Britain."
01:57:11;01:57:16;"And December 8th, 2024 at the OVO Hydro in Glasgow, UK,"
01:57:16;01:57:19;"you can catch Teenage Fan Club with Vampire Weekend."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Tickets available now."
