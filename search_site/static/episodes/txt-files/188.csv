01:21;01:24;"What's up, Jake?"
01:24;01:25;"Last one of the year."
01:25;01:26;"We made it."
01:26;01:28;"Unbelievable."
01:28;01:29;"What a year."
01:29;01:32;"The next day that Time Crisis would air"
01:32;01:35;"would be Christmas Eve."
01:35;01:36;"So they'll probably just-"
01:36;01:37;"Run a rerun?"
01:37;01:40;"Maybe a rerun or some Christmas music, I don't know."
01:40;01:42;"I feel like we did a Christmas,"
01:42;01:47;"way back when we did like a Christmas episode or two."
01:47;01:48;"Maybe year one or year two."
01:48;01:50;"I remember you and I going through a bunch of like,"
01:50;01:52;"rock Christmas songs"
01:52;01:57;"in like 2015 or 2016."
01:57;02:00;"It's like, oh yeah, Kinks, Father Christmas."
02:00;02:03;"Just the same ones over and over again."
02:03;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:06;"Paul McCartney, Wonderful Christmas Time."
02:06;02:07;"Right."
02:07;02:10;"The Christmas song discourse, it just doesn't change."
02:10;02:13;"I think maybe the young generation,"
02:13;02:16;"the children now will have some new things to say about it."
02:16;02:19;"But I kind of feel like we lived through a time"
02:19;02:22;"where people would like talk about the canon."
02:22;02:23;"Like I feel like for the last 20 years,"
02:23;02:25;"a lot of people have been talking about,"
02:25;02:28;"is that Paul McCartney Christmas song actually good?"
02:28;02:30;"I think it was kind of like a Gen X."
02:30;02:31;"Oh, it's not."
02:31;02:32;"All right, well, that's funny."
02:32;02:33;"I was about to say,"
02:33;02:34;"it's kind of like a Gen X millennial thing."
02:34;02:37;"That's when the years between come into play."
02:37;02:39;"Jake said, absolutely not."
02:39;02:40;"I would say it's pretty good."
02:40;02:41;"Yeah, it's good."
02:41;02:43;"So the millennials are saying,"
02:43;02:48;"simply having a wonderful Christmas dime is good."
02:48;02:50;"Dime?"
02:50;02:51;"Yeah."
02:51;02:54;"And the wonderful Christmas dime."
02:55;02:57;"All right, throw it on."
02:57;02:58;"Well, here we go."
02:58;03:00;"This became our Christmas episode."
03:00;03:03;"It's not hard to see it through the eyes of Gen X"
03:03;03:07;"or perhaps McCartney's fellow boomers"
03:07;03:08;"who would have seen this as,"
03:08;03:13;"this song as kind of like the epitome of like corny,"
03:13;03:16;"past his prime, 80s McCartney."
03:16;03:18;"Is it 80s?"
03:18;03:20;"I think maybe like 1980."
03:20;03:22;"Okay, I would have guessed, I don't know,"
03:22;03:25;"77 or something, but okay."
03:25;03:26;"Okay, well, let's find out."
03:26;03:27;"Not gonna split hairs."
03:27;03:29;"It's 1979."
03:29;03:31;"Ooh, damn."
03:31;03:35;"Just missed it."
03:35;03:36;"What month?"
03:36;03:37;"December?"
03:37;03:38;"November."
03:38;03:41;"Ah, really close."
03:41;03:47;"There is just a little bit of that 70s skank on it still."
03:47;03:48;"Yeah."
03:48;03:50;"♪ The mood is right ♪"
03:50;03:52;"♪ The spirit's up ♪"
03:52;03:55;"♪ We're here tonight ♪"
03:55;03:57;"♪ And that's enough ♪"
03:57;04:01;"♪ Simply having a wonderful Christmas time ♪"
04:01;04:04;"The reason that slightly younger people"
04:04;04:07;"think this song is good and or cool"
04:07;04:10;"is 'cause it's like, it's weird, it's eerie."
04:10;04:12;"It's eerie old sense."
04:12;04:16;"It reminds people of like kind of spooky cartoons"
04:16;04:18;"you might've seen as a child that kind of,"
04:19;04:23;"it's like a little bit like chill wave or something."
04:23;04:24;"So you can see why to the millennials,"
04:24;04:26;"this had like chill wave energy,"
04:26;04:30;"just like it's eerie, it's vibey, it's spooky."
04:30;04:32;"The synth sound is cool."
04:32;04:36;"I don't think it's eerie or vibey, but what do I know?"
04:36;04:40;"I mean, the synths are kind of goofy."
04:48;04:50;"Yeah, this part's kind of vibey."
04:50;05:08;"♪ Simply having a wonderful Christmas time ♪"
05:08;05:13;"♪ We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time ♪"
05:13;05:18;"♪ Simply having a wonderful Christmas time ♪"
05:18;05:20;"Just hearing that chorus repeated,"
05:20;05:22;"♪ Simply having ♪"
05:22;05:25;"It just makes me think of being in like a Toys R Us"
05:25;05:28;"or like a CVS and like wanting to blow my head off."
05:28;05:33;"Like just stressful, like retail environment,"
05:33;05:35;"December 22nd."
05:35;05:37;"And like that is like insisting"
05:37;05:40;"that I'm having a wonderful Christmas time."
05:40;05:44;"♪ The choir of children sing their song ♪"
05:44;05:49;"♪ They practiced all year long ♪"
05:49;05:50;"♪ Ding dong ♪"
05:50;05:53;"You know what guys, you're talking Beatles,"
05:53;05:55;"you're a Paul guy, you're a John guy."
05:55;05:56;"I'm a John guy."
05:56;05:58;"The John Lennon Christmas song"
05:58;06:01;"is heads and shoulders above the Paul song."
06:01;06:04;"Yes, kind of undeniable."
06:04;06:08;"Although they are two sides of the same coin in a funny way."
06:08;06:09;"Yeah."
06:09;06:11;"And actually it's a bit unfair"
06:11;06:14;"because the John Lennon Christmas song,"
06:14;06:16;"I think was recorded in like '69,"
06:16;06:18;"a full decade before this."
06:18;06:22;"This song, he wouldn't have used synths at the time,"
06:22;06:25;"but the general mood of it doesn't feel a million miles away"
06:25;06:28;"from stuff on Double Fantasy."
06:28;06:30;"You know, Lennon's last album"
06:30;06:33;"when he was getting a little more domestic and sweet."
06:33;06:35;"Nostalgic, looking back, yeah."
06:35;06:36;"If he had lived, there would have been"
06:36;06:37;"like a total convergence."
06:37;06:41;"I could totally picture having some time in the '90s"
06:41;06:44;"and they still would have had this like slight competition."
06:44;06:47;"I could totally picture there being a narrative"
06:47;06:49;"within like the classic rock world where it's like,"
06:49;06:53;"1993, the year McCartney made a Lennon album"
06:53;06:55;"and Lennon made a McCartney album."
06:55;06:56;"Can you just like picture that?"
06:56;06:58;"Like John made like a surprisingly"
06:58;07:01;"nostalgic domestic album with songs"
07:01;07:03;"about like the Penny Lane type songs"
07:03;07:05;"about like growing up in England"
07:05;07:08;"and McCartney was like, for whatever reason,"
07:08;07:10;"he'd been listening to a lot of like grunge or something"
07:10;07:13;"and he made this like kind of darker, more intense album."
07:13;07:15;"People were like, ""Whoa!"""
07:15;07:16;"And the release on the same day."
07:16;07:18;"Released on the same day."
07:18;07:19;"I think you're right though about the, you know,"
07:19;07:23;"it's tough to compare the songs that are 10 years apart."
07:23;07:25;"If McCartney had written a Christmas song"
07:25;07:27;"and recorded it when he was making like, you know,"
07:27;07:29;"his first solo record,"
07:29;07:34;"it would have been a much vibier, homier, cozier vibe."
07:34;07:36;"- The other thing I want to say about the McCartney song"
07:36;07:40;"first is that another thing that happened"
07:40;07:43;"with the discourse around McCartney too,"
07:43;07:45;"is that, I meant McCartney also,"
07:45;07:47;"but his album, McCartney 2,"
07:47;07:49;"which came out roughly the same time"
07:49;07:52;"as Wonderful Christmas and sounds like it"
07:52;07:56;"because it's a little freaky, weird sense."
07:56;08:01;"In a small way, that became a kind of a rediscovered classic"
08:01;08:04;"for millennials, I guess I would say,"
08:04;08:06;"if we're talking generations."
08:06;08:08;"That was a way in for people to be like,"
08:08;08:09;"""You know what?"
08:09;08:11;"Actually, McCartney was doing some weird (beep)"
08:11;08:13;"and there is cool stuff on McCartney 2."""
08:13;08:16;"Were you ever part of that McCartney 2 wave?"
08:16;08:19;"- Yeah, no, I mean, that album is mind-blowing."
08:19;08:22;"I mean, it's so out of step with like what he did before"
08:22;08:27;"and it's really like a kind of singular moment in his career."
08:27;08:29;"- There's a song from that popped into my head recently"
08:29;08:31;"called ""Check My Machine."""
08:31;08:32;"- Uh-huh."
08:32;08:34;"- I don't know why, like maybe I heard somebody say something"
08:34;08:35;"that sounded like ""Check My Machine"""
08:35;08:38;"and then it made me think of like this weird McCartney song,"
08:38;08:40;"""Check my machine."""
08:40;08:41;"And I was like, ""Oh yeah, it's on McCartney 2."""
08:41;08:45;"And then I looked it up and it was a bonus track."
08:45;08:47;"And I was like, ""Damn, he was really,"
08:47;08:49;"he was like firing on all cylinders."""
08:49;08:50;"- Yeah."
08:50;08:51;"- The album itself is cool and weird."
08:51;08:55;"The single, which is not indicative of the synthy sound,"
08:55;08:57;"but coming up was like a really solid song."
08:57;09:00;"And then even these like deep cuts gave you the sense of like,"
09:00;09:01;"oh, it was a very fertile period for him."
09:01;09:03;"- Temporary secretary."
09:03;09:05;"- Temporary secretary."
09:05;09:08;"- And then there's beautiful ballads on that one too."
09:08;09:09;"- Oh yeah, ""Waterfalls."""
09:09;09:10;"- Right."
09:10;09:11;"And there's another one too."
09:11;09:12;"I don't have the tracks in front of me,"
09:12;09:15;"but I listened to that record a lot, 10 or 15 years ago."
09:15;09:18;"- So you can see why like with the rediscovery of that album"
09:18;09:21;"people might in a weird way lump ""Wonderful Christmas Time"""
09:21;09:25;"into his like 79, 80 synth wave."
09:25;09:26;"- I don't see that."
09:26;09:30;"Well, I mean, I see it, I guess in like the plucky synths,"
09:30;09:32;"but the songwriting,"
09:32;09:37;"there's nothing so out and out corny on ""McCartney 2."""
09:37;09:39;"- Yeah, as ""Wonderful Christmas Time."""
09:39;09:40;"- Yeah."
09:40;09:43;"Not a fan of the song, won't be convinced."
09:43;09:48;"It's just sort of like a instinctual aesthetic reaction"
09:48;09:51;"of like, I like a lot of Paul songs,"
09:51;09:54;"but that's the side of Paul that I'm not a big fan"
09:54;09:55;"of the very cloying."
09:55;09:57;"- I get it, he's having a good time."
09:57;10:00;"He's having a laugh, it's Christmas, but you know."
10:00;10:01;"- He's having a wonderful Christmas time."
10:01;10:04;"- He's having a wonderful Christmas time."
10:04;10:05;"It's all good."
10:05;10:06;"- Fair enough."
10:06;10:08;"It's maybe my least favorite ""McCartney."""
10:08;10:09;"- Yeah, fair enough."
10:09;10:10;"But my larger point though,"
10:10;10:12;"is like even this discussion we're having right now,"
10:12;10:15;"we're still talking about the song from 1979."
10:15;10:20;"Are there any songs that were added to the Christmas canon"
10:20;10:22;"since the 90s, since Mariah Carey?"
10:22;10:25;"- Seinfeld, Nick, can we get some number crunch?"
10:25;10:27;"I'm picturing if you guys search this,"
10:27;10:29;"you're gonna find some like random article"
10:29;10:31;"that's like the 10 best Christmas songs"
10:31;10:32;"from the 21st century."
10:32;10:34;"And you'll like list them and me and Jake will be like,"
10:34;10:36;"we never heard any of these."
10:36;10:36;"- I feel when people-"
10:36;10:40;"- Creed like has a great Christmas song."
10:40;10:42;"- When people talk about Christmas,"
10:42;10:45;"they do talk about Michael Bublé a lot."
10:45;10:49;"Is he just doing standards or is he doing original songs?"
10:49;10:50;"- No."
10:50;10:51;"- I want original."
10:51;10:52;"- I've never heard an original."
10:52;10:53;"- Yeah, yeah."
10:53;10:56;"- Michael Bublé did a cool big band arrangement of"
10:56;10:58;"""Do You See What I See?"""
10:58;10:59;"Who cares?"
10:59;11:02;"I mean, all due respect, I'm just saying,"
11:02;11:06;"is Christmas culture frozen in the 20th century?"
11:06;11:08;"- It feels a little frozen to me."
11:08;11:09;"I mean, personally, as an adult,"
11:09;11:11;"like actually I was texting with my brother the other day"
11:11;11:15;"and we were like, Christmas should be every three years."
11:15;11:17;"'Cause then it would be actually special."
11:17;11:18;"(laughing)"
11:18;11:20;"'Cause it's just so exhausting."
11:20;11:23;"I'm just like, oh my God, I have to go get stuff for people."
11:23;11:25;"Like, you know, it's someone's birthday."
11:25;11:25;"That's kind of cool."
11:25;11:27;"Like you go get something."
11:27;11:29;"But like when you're like getting together with the family,"
11:29;11:31;"it's like, I gotta get something for my mom, my dad,"
11:31;11:32;"my in-laws, blah, blah, blah."
11:32;11:34;"It's just like, and then when the kids get to like"
11:34;11:35;"the excitable Christmas,"
11:35;11:38;"well, maybe when the kids get excited about Christmas,"
11:38;11:39;"then it becomes-"
11:39;11:40;"- That's when you want it to be every year."
11:40;11:41;"- That's when it becomes fun again."
11:41;11:44;"But like, oh my God."
11:44;11:48;"Like, I'm just kind of low-key dreading Christmas."
11:48;11:49;"- All right, well, sounds like you're in a bit of like"
11:49;11:50;"a Scrooge situation."
11:50;11:55;"And I imagine that probably something will warm your heart"
11:55;11:56;"this Christmas."
11:56;11:57;"And-"
11:57;11:59;"- Yeah, listen, going, hanging out-"
11:59;12:00;"- Hallmark group."
12:00;12:02;"- Hanging out with family and going up there"
12:02;12:04;"to see my parents, that's gonna be great."
12:04;12:07;"Cooking food, drinking cocktails, all good."
12:07;12:08;"It's the sort of like-"
12:08;12:09;"- You're not a true Scrooge,"
12:09;12:12;"but you get bogged down by the commercialism"
12:12;12:14;"and the demands."
12:14;12:17;"- And you know, as you age, like the years go by so fast."
12:17;12:20;"And I'm like, it just felt like it was Christmas."
12:20;12:21;"I guess what I'm saying, every three years,"
12:21;12:22;"it'd be like, okay, it's like,"
12:22;12:24;"this is like the World Cup or something."
12:24;12:25;"It's like kind of special."
12:25;12:26;"- Yeah."
12:26;12:27;"- It's Christmas this year, can you believe it?"
12:27;12:28;"Like-"
12:28;12:30;"- The World Cup model's great."

13:55;13:56;"- Yeah, this is-"
13:56;13:57;"- What are those titles?"
13:57;14:01;"- This is an article called 55 Best Modern Christmas Songs"
14:01;14:04;"for an Instant Dose of Holiday Cheer."
14:04;14:05;"What are the titles?"
14:05;14:06;"I mean, it's a lot-"
14:06;14:07;"- Hit me with some titles."
14:07;14:08;"- It's an instant dose."
14:08;14:09;"I mean, we got number one is"
14:09;14:12;"Christmas Tree Farm by Taylor Swift."
14:12;14:13;"Have you ever heard of this song?"
14:13;14:15;"- No, that's a compelling title."
14:15;14:18;"- Yeah, but it's like, I'm just saying,"
14:18;14:20;"there's a lot of pop heavy hitters,"
14:20;14:22;"but no cultural resonance."
14:22;14:24;"A few Ariana Grande songs,"
14:24;14:27;"Mariah Carey's tried to replicate the magic,"
14:27;14:30;"but nothing has really taken, you know,"
14:30;14:31;"Buble's on this list."
14:31;14:33;"It is all standards."
14:33;14:35;"- It's a 20th century holiday, apparently."
14:35;14:37;"They really should make it like the World Cup, Jake."
14:37;14:38;"That's a great idea."
14:38;14:41;"- Until people really start to appreciate it"
14:41;14:44;"and really have something new to say about it."
14:44;14:45;"Maybe the truth is,"
14:45;14:49;"it's as Christmas became kind of a secular thing,"
14:49;14:54;"it naturally got tied to kind of 20th century commercialism."
14:54;14:56;"You know?"
14:56;14:56;"- Yeah."
14:56;14:58;"- So you either put the Christ back in Christmas"
14:58;15:00;"or make it like the World Cup."
15:00;15:02;"If you want it to be a commercial phenomenon,"
15:02;15:04;"you got to space out the sequels a little bit."
15:04;15:06;"If you want it to be a religious thing,"
15:06;15:07;"celebrating the birth of your savior,"
15:07;15:08;"by all means, once a year."
15:08;15:10;"But if you're more on the camp"
15:10;15:14;"that it's a big, just global marketing event,"
15:14;15:16;"World Cup model makes a lot more sense."
15:16;15:18;"- You know, what's weird is,"
15:18;15:20;"a very like not modern song is on this list."
15:20;15:23;"At number 48, it's Bruce Springsteen's"
15:23;15:25;"cover of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"""
15:25;15:30;"which was recorded live at CW Post College in 1975."
15:30;15:30;"Are you guys-"
15:30;15:32;"- Yeah, he's been playing that for-"
15:32;15:32;"- That's a classic."
15:32;15:35;"- This is a big, is it good?"
15:35;15:36;"- No."
15:36;15:38;"- It's fun, well, it's fun."

15:42;15:42;"- Oh, great."
15:42;15:44;"♪ Santa Claus ♪"
15:44;15:45;"- Without even hearing it,"
15:45;15:47;"I can already tell you that I'm sure"
15:47;15:50;"the Taylor Swift ""Christmas Tree Farm"" song"
15:50;15:54;"is probably more in the vein"
15:54;15:57;"of like a Joni Mitchell ""River"" type song,"
15:57;15:59;"where I imagine-"
15:59;16:00;"- It's like sad."
16:00;16:02;"- It's more like, it's like, yeah,"
16:02;16:04;"or like a sad meditation on life"
16:04;16:07;"that happens to take place at Christmas."
16:07;16:08;"It could very well be a great song."
16:08;16:11;"It could be one of her best for all I know."
16:11;16:13;"I just already know that it's not like-"
16:13;16:14;"- A Christmas song."
16:14;16:15;"- One of those songs that's gonna"
16:15;16:18;"instantly connote holiday cheer."
16:18;16:20;"'Cause also I feel like with the Christmas movies"
16:20;16:23;"they make for kids, you already know"
16:23;16:26;"they're gonna use, depending on their budget,"
16:26;16:27;"there's probably gonna be a part"
16:27;16:31;"where somebody puts on sunglasses or whatever,"
16:31;16:33;"and then you hear like Run-D.M.C."
16:33;16:36;"(imitates music)"
16:36;16:38;"There's gonna be like a hip hop moment,"
16:38;16:40;"and they're gonna go back 40 years."

16:46;16:48;"- That song rolls."
16:48;16:49;"- It does roll."
16:49;16:51;"- Some ale reindeer."
16:51;16:53;"(laughs)"
16:53;16:55;"- But it's the same songs over and over again."

17:37;17:41;"- One cool phenomenon, somebody said this to me"
17:41;17:44;"about Japanese Christmas and Seinfeld."
17:44;17:45;"Maybe you know a bit about this too,"
17:45;17:48;"'cause Japanese Christmas is kind of its own thing."
17:48;17:50;"We probably already talked about how here"
17:50;17:52;"you go to KFC on Christmas."
17:52;17:53;"- Oh, right, right, right. - We talked about that"
17:53;17:54;"on the show?"
17:54;17:55;"- We have. - Right."
17:55;17:56;"- Get a Christmas bucket."
17:56;17:58;"- You get a Christmas bucket at KFC."
17:58;18:01;"And also, if you're single, I think there's some people,"
18:01;18:04;"there's a bit of like a Valentine's Day element."
18:04;18:08;"Like maybe you, at some point you might kind of go on a date"
18:08;18:10;"with your boyfriend or girlfriend."
18:10;18:11;"- On Christmas."
18:11;18:13;"- This is one of these things that like somebody says to you"
18:13;18:15;"and then you're kind of like kicking the tires on it."
18:15;18:17;"Somebody said to us at some point,"
18:17;18:19;"well, the thing in Japan,"
18:19;18:21;"it's different than in the West, it's flipped."
18:21;18:26;"They said Christmas is kind of like a lover's holiday."
18:26;18:29;"Young people go out and do something fun together"
18:29;18:34;"on a date and then New Year's, you spend with your family."
18:34;18:35;"- Oh, interesting."
18:35;18:37;"- And I think that the New Year's thing is true."
18:37;18:40;"New Year's here is generally seen as quiet."
18:40;18:43;"There's traditional foods you go eat with your family."
18:43;18:45;"I think Christmas, there is a family element."
18:45;18:46;"I don't know if it's a thing where you stop"
18:46;18:48;"by your family's house and say,"
18:48;18:49;"oh, I gotta go on my Christmas date."
18:49;18:52;"- But does Japan like shut down on Christmas"
18:52;18:55;"the way the US and Europe do?"
18:55;18:57;"Or are people going to work on Christmas?"
18:57;18:58;"- That's a great question."
18:58;18:59;"I'm not sure."
18:59;19:01;"I think it shuts down a bit on New Year's."
19:01;19:02;"- I have to disagree."
19:02;19:06;"I had the craziest New Year's I've ever had in Tokyo."
19:06;19:10;"During the day you go and there's wishing a good year"
19:10;19:12;"and there's a certain amount of ritual around it,"
19:12;19:14;"but it goes off."
19:14;19:16;"- What year was this?"
19:16;19:17;"- 2010."
19:17;19:19;"You couldn't even find champagne."
19:19;19:23;"That was, you know, it was absolutely wild."
19:23;19:25;"Everyone in the streets staying up"
19:25;19:27;"till six, seven in the morning."
19:27;19:28;"- A lot of Japanese people."
19:28;19:30;"- A lot of Japanese people, yeah."
19:30;19:32;"- Maybe it depends on the neighborhood."
19:32;19:32;"I don't know."
19:32;19:33;"Somebody was saying like,"
19:33;19:37;"you're gonna go to certain places where even like"
19:37;19:41;"a lot of stores and restaurants might even be closed early."
19:41;19:45;"- I'm very into the quiet New Year's Eve vibe,"
19:45;19:47;"as I'm solidly in my mid forties now."
19:47;19:48;"- That's how it should be regardless."
19:48;19:50;"- Just a quiet New Year's Eve."
19:50;19:52;"- Kicking off the New Year hungover doesn't make any sense."
19:52;19:55;"But anyway, I was thinking, but yeah, generally,"
19:55;19:56;"like Nick, you might be right."
19:56;19:57;"These are just things people say to you all the time"
19:57;19:58;"when you're in a different country"
19:58;20:00;"and there's a language barrier, like,"
20:00;20:01;"well, you know, here it's more like this."
20:01;20:03;"And you're kind of like, oh really?"
20:03;20:04;"And you're like, okay."
20:04;20:09;"- How come there are no like New Year's Eve traditional songs"
20:09;20:12;"like, I feel like that would be like a market."
20:12;20:14;"- There's just old Lang Zang."
20:14;20:15;"- Yeah, there's no like--"
20:15;20:17;"- I think because they wrote the perfect one"
20:17;20:18;"and that was that."
20:18;20:19;"Boom."
20:19;20:20;"Nothing needed."
20:20;20:22;"Again, this is one of these things people say,"
20:22;20:24;"whether or not I can't really speak to whether it's true,"
20:24;20:25;"although I've heard it."
20:25;20:27;"Somebody said, well, here in Japan,"
20:27;20:31;"it's very obvious what the greatest Christmas song is."
20:31;20:32;"And I said, oh yeah?"
20:32;20:34;"And they said, ""Last Christmas"" by Wham."
20:34;20:39;"That's the people's choice, favorite Christmas song,"
20:39;20:42;"like head and shoulders above everything else."
20:42;20:45;"And I kind of, it's funny, in the US for a while,"
20:45;20:46;"it really seemed like Mariah Carey,"
20:46;20:49;"that was the Christmas song."
20:49;20:51;"Which is interesting because that song came out"
20:51;20:52;"in the '90s and you would think that the popularity"
20:52;20:55;"of the Mariah Carey Christmas song meant"
20:55;21:00;"that there was totally a runway and cultural space"
21:00;21:03;"for new Christmas songs to come in."
21:03;21:07;"If the biggest Christmas song of the 20th century"
21:07;21:10;"came out in the '90s, if you were betting, man,"
21:10;21:12;"you would bet that maybe an even bigger one might come out"
21:12;21:15;"in the 2000s and in the 2010s after that."
21:15;21:18;"But then it turns out the '90s was obviously the end"
21:18;21:21;"of a certain type of culture."
21:21;21:23;"But anyway, in Japan, apparently it's ""Last Christmas"""
21:23;21:27;"by Wham, which weirdly seems Japanese to me."
21:27;21:28;"I don't know that one. - I don't know that one."
21:28;21:29;"- For a second."
21:29;21:30;"Oh yeah, you do."
21:30;21:32;"- Oh, you definitely do."
21:32;21:35;"- Uh-oh, this might be another repeat of."
21:35;21:36;"- I just don't see how you could have gone"
21:36;21:41;"to the Americana in December and not know this song."

25:27;25:29;"Everything that I'm hearing really sounds"
25:29;25:31;"like ""Christmas Needs to Get Back to Basics."""
25:31;25:32;"- I agree."
25:32;25:35;"It's stuck in this weird 20th century moment."
25:35;25:36;"Take it all the way back."
25:36;25:38;"If you're gonna be stuck in a century,"
25:38;25:40;"how about the first century?"
25:40;25:42;"- How about 20 centuries ago?"
25:42;25:43;"- How about the year one?"
25:43;25:45;"And everybody needs to remember that"
25:45;25:47;"Jesus was not born in the year zero."
25:47;25:49;"He was born in the year one."
25:49;25:50;"- I just have this memory as a kid,"
25:50;25:54;"like getting like my plastic, like He-Man action figures"
25:54;25:55;"and stuff for Christmas."
25:55;25:57;"And then my dad's mom, my grandmother,"
25:57;26:01;"just being like a depression kid or depression era kid."
26:01;26:05;"And just being like, you know, Christmas morning,"
26:05;26:06;"we would get an orange."
26:06;26:11;"And it was the best piece of fruit we had all year."
26:11;26:14;"We wouldn't have another orange until the next Christmas."
26:14;26:15;"- Whoa."
26:15;26:18;"- And I'm just like ripping open like"
26:18;26:20;"these He-Man action figures."
26:20;26:21;"- Cool story, grandma."
26:21;26:26;"- Just like all like the Christmas chocolate,"
26:26;26:29;"just like this absurd bounty, you know,"
26:29;26:31;"circa 1987 or whatever."
26:31;26:34;"- It's cool that now you've synthesized"
26:34;26:36;"your experience as a kid."
26:36;26:37;"Now you can understand your grandma's perspective"
26:37;26:38;"a little bit more."
26:38;26:40;"And now you're a huge advocate"
26:40;26:44;"for the World Cup Christmas schedule."
26:44;26:47;"- I'm reading on guideable.com."
26:47;26:50;"If you're a single man in Japan,"
26:50;26:52;"what do you do on Christmas?"
26:52;26:55;"And it says, quote, those guys who are single"
26:55;26:56;"will go to the supermarket"
26:56;26:58;"before the Christmas season starts"
26:58;27:00;"and try to buy as many foods as possible."
27:00;27:02;"Why do they do this?"
27:02;27:04;"Because they're trying to store the food"
27:04;27:07;"so they won't have to go out of their room on Christmas day."
27:07;27:09;"- Oh, and see the lovers?"
27:09;27:10;"- Yeah."
27:10;27:11;"- That's really emo."
27:11;27:13;"- So then you can understand why last Christmas"
27:13;27:16;"might be the people's favorite in Japan."
27:16;27:18;"And also, of course, Japan,"
27:18;27:20;"there's so much Christmas stuff around,"
27:20;27:23;"but it's imported so that you're gonna get naturally"
27:23;27:27;"like a bit of a prismatic version of Christmas,"
27:27;27:30;"you know, through many cultural layers."
27:30;27:31;"So it makes sense."
27:31;27:33;"Maybe they can see Christmas more clearly."
27:33;27:36;"Modern Christmas for the melancholy spectacle it is."
27:36;27:40;"- I wonder if Japan did Christmas like pre-World War II."
27:40;27:43;"Japan in like the '30s, are they doing Christmas?"
27:43;27:44;"I don't think so."
27:44;27:47;"- I imagine there's a small, very small Christian minority"
27:47;27:50;"who might've been having a religious celebration."
27:50;27:54;"But would your local restaurant or market"
27:54;27:56;"in a village in 1930s Japan"
27:56;27:59;"have Christmas tree decals on the window?"
27:59;28:00;"I'm not picturing it."
28:00;28:02;"- It would."
28:02;28:03;"It might come as a surprise to many,"
28:03;28:07;"but actually Japan's relationship with Christmas"
28:07;28:07;"is quite old."
28:07;28:09;"Records indicate that the first Christmas in Japan"
28:09;28:11;"was in 1552."
28:11;28:12;"- What the hell?"
28:12;28:13;"- Only three short years after the introduction"
28:13;28:14;"of Christianity."
28:14;28:19;"Moreover, in 1560, Kyoto held a huge Christmas day mass."
28:19;28:20;"- Damn."
28:20;28:22;"- Well, but with all these things, it's like, again,"
28:22;28:25;"yeah, because there were Portuguese missionaries"
28:25;28:25;"coming back then."
28:25;28:27;"So there were Christians."
28:27;28:29;"You just need to, with all this stuff, it's always like,"
28:29;28:31;"but you gotta know, man on the street."
28:31;28:32;"- Right."
28:32;28:35;"- Was the man on the street thinking about Christmas"
28:35;28:36;"on December 25th?"
28:36;28:38;"- 1560."
28:38;28:39;"- Yeah, again, I'm willing to believe"
28:39;28:42;"there were Christians passionately celebrating the holiday."
28:42;28:43;"- Yeah."
28:43;28:45;"- It's really sad to realize that there's not a single"
28:45;28:48;"addition to the Christmas canon."
28:48;28:51;"And I mean, I guess you could just say the, you know,"
28:51;28:53;"whatever culture splintered,"
28:53;28:55;"and there just could never be a consensus pick"
28:55;28:58;"in the same way, but there still are hit songs."
28:58;28:58;"You know what I mean?"
28:58;29:00;"- Yeah, I mean, it is puzzling."
29:00;29:00;"I mean."
29:00;29:01;"- In this splintered moment,"
29:01;29:06;"everybody still knows Harry Styles as it was."
29:06;29:06;"Everybody."
29:06;29:07;"- Yeah."
29:07;29:08;"- It just, it plays too much."
29:08;29:11;"You can't, whether you like it, don't like it,"
29:11;29:12;"that's an inescapable giant hit."
29:12;29:14;"There's other songs like that."
29:14;29:16;"So as much as things splinter,"
29:16;29:19;"there's not a single Christmas addition to the canon."
29:19;29:22;"- I mean, maybe just because like modern production"
29:22;29:25;"is just so gnarly,"
29:25;29:28;"like maybe there's a version where like someone like"
29:28;29:33;"Post Malone does some like tasteful acoustic or paint,"
29:33;29:35;"like stripped down or Taylor Swift or whoever"
29:35;29:38;"does some sort of like tasteful palette Christmas song."
29:38;29:40;"Like, cause I feel like, I don't know, man,"
29:40;29:43;"like recording a Christmas,"
29:43;29:45;"let's say you write a great Christmas song."
29:45;29:46;"- Yeah."
29:46;29:48;"- And then you record it with like contemporary production"
29:48;29:50;"and then you're trying to play it at the house"
29:50;29:52;"with like your parents and grandparents."
29:52;29:54;"It's not gonna, it's not gonna fly."
29:54;29:57;"- Christmas Tree Farm sounds pretty tasteful."
29:57;29:59;"- Can we throw it on?"
29:59;29:59;"- All right, yeah, we'll go."
29:59;30:00;"- I think Ezra's right."
30:00;30:02;"I think it's not really a Christmas song, but."

31:48;31:49;"She was stressed out in the big city,"
31:49;31:53;"but in her heart is like a rural Christmas,"
31:53;31:54;"Christmas tree farm."
31:54;31:56;"- I heard that title,"
31:56;31:57;"I immediately thought of like,"
31:57;32:00;"oh, it's a funny comment on like the commercialism."
32:00;32:04;"Like there's like a plot of land"
32:04;32:08;"that's devoted to growing these like industrial"
32:08;32:10;"to dwarf pine trees."
32:10;32:14;"It's like, I thought of it as a sort of dystopian vision."
32:14;32:17;"Like, couldn't you picture some like weird art photograph"
32:17;32:18;"of just like-"
32:18;32:20;"- Like raising a place energy?"
32:20;32:22;"- Yeah, completely homogenized landscape"
32:22;32:24;"of just Christmas tree farms."
32:24;32:26;"- Yeah, it would have been a combination"
32:26;32:30;"of Joni Mitchell, River plus Big Yellow Taxi."
32:30;32:31;"- Exactly."
32:31;32:34;"- And I think Taylor Swift has songs like that"
32:34;32:38;"or she has like sad, folky songs, of course."
32:38;32:41;"So I could totally picture like acoustic ballad."
32:41;32:46;"That's just like, my heart feels like a Christmas tree farm,"
32:46;32:50;"nothing but stumps, grown to be cut down,"
32:50;32:52;"just kind of really sad."
32:52;32:57;"- Yeah, apparently this is a biographical song."
32:57;33:00;"Sounds like Taylor Swift grew up"
33:00;33:03;"or working on Christmas tree farms."
33:03;33:05;"- Oh, did her family own one?"
33:05;33:08;"- Not sure, but she did say we all had jobs in the farm."
33:08;33:12;"Mine was picking the praying mantis pods off the trees,"
33:12;33:13;"collecting them so that the bugs"
33:13;33:16;"wouldn't hatch inside people's houses."
33:16;33:17;"- Whoa, that'd be a cool Christmas."
33:17;33:21;"Come downstairs, it's the whole family praying mantis."
33:21;33:26;"Just post it up all over your tree."
33:26;33:29;"Praying mantis pods, interesting."
33:29;33:30;"- She lived on a Christmas tree farm"
33:30;33:33;"in Redding, Pennsylvania as a young kid."
33:33;33:34;"- Crazy."
33:34;33:37;"- But yeah, not an instant classic."
33:37;33:39;"- It's not gonna become like a 20th century classic."
33:39;33:41;"And she's the biggest artist in the world."
33:41;33:42;"It's no knock."
33:42;33:45;"It's just, there's just seems to be no appetite"
33:45;33:46;"to add to the canon."
33:46;33:48;"- Yeah, there's no cultural room for it."
33:48;33:52;"- In 20 years, is there gonna be a children's movie"
33:52;33:52;"where they drop?"
33:52;33:55;"Yeah, they might, just because if they can't afford"
33:55;33:58;"Mariah Carey, but yeah, that also doesn't,"
33:58;34:01;"it adds something to her world, sure."
34:01;34:02;"We only listened to it once."
34:02;34:03;"It sounds like, you know,"
34:03;34:06;"a classic Taylor Swift storytelling songwriting."
34:06;34:09;"I'm sure her fans love it as an addition to,"
34:09;34:12;"it's something for them to throw on at Christmas time."
34:12;34:16;"But just vibe wise, is there anything that's missing"
34:16;34:18;"between the kind of like sad John Lennon,"
34:18;34:22;"so this is Christmas, the Mariah Carey fun one,"
34:22;34:25;"the Run DMC, it's almost like we still have"
34:25;34:26;"our bases covered."
34:26;34:29;"And also like with modern music,"
34:29;34:31;"there's not gonna be like a trap Christmas classic."
34:31;34:33;"I'm sure if we went on YouTube,"
34:33;34:37;"we could find literally 1 million trap remixes"
34:37;34:39;"of like, (singing)"
34:39;34:42;"(imitating drumming)"
34:42;34:45;"Yeah, but no appetite for it."
34:45;34:46;"It's the war on Christmas."
34:46;34:48;"I guess the war on Christmas won."

36:04;36:06;"- Jake, maybe you gotta explain where this comes from."
36:06;36:08;"People might not be familiar."
36:08;36:09;"- Well, I don't really know."
36:09;36:12;"I mean, I got a text from my brother a few weeks ago"
36:12;36:15;"with just, you know, an audio file"
36:15;36:18;"in the body of a text message and I pushed play"
36:18;36:20;"and I had no idea what I was listening to."
36:20;36:24;"And I immediately was like, this is total TC fodder."

39:58;40:03;"is that it is a bit amateurish."
40:03;40:05;"Some weird folk album that nobody ever heard"
40:05;40:08;"from the '60s, or some like, you know,"
40:08;40:10;"digging into like the lessors,"

40:19;40:21;"professional, or it's a little more idiosyncratic."
40:21;40:23;"What's interesting about this song is"
40:23;40:25;"it's like exceptionally well-made."
40:25;40:28;"- And sung."
40:28;40:30;"- The guy's a great singer, and even like,"
40:30;40:33;"there's something about it, like maybe the mix"
40:33;40:36;"makes it sound not quite like something"
40:36;40:39;"that you would have, you know, a massive hit from that era."
40:39;40:43;"But the arrangement really is like excellent."
40:43;40:45;"The playing's great, and even that,"
40:45;40:47;"""Boom, I was born in the boom."""
40:47;40:51;"It's not, very little about it is amateur."
40:51;40:54;"And as we did some digging to find out"
40:54;40:56;"where this actually came from,"
40:56;41:00;"it was on a compilation album called ""Made in the USA,"""
41:00;41:03;"which came out in 1986, that was put together"
41:03;41:08;"by a Cincinnati radio station called WEBN,"
41:08;41:10;"which still exists in some form,"
41:10;41:14;"but they would basically do these albums"
41:14;41:17;"to highlight local artists."
41:17;41:19;"So this band, Hoodwink, I think they released"
41:19;41:22;"very little music outside of this song."
41:22;41:23;"They were a local band."
41:23;41:25;"So once we realized that this was just like"
41:25;41:28;"a local Cincinnati band that maybe had a connection"
41:28;41:31;"to this radio station on this special compilation,"
41:31;41:32;"I was even more impressed."
41:32;41:34;"- It must've been a real standout."
41:34;41:36;"- Yeah, and these must've been like some,"
41:36;41:39;"like maybe some of the best, I don't know,"
41:39;41:44;"arrangers, players, singers in Cincinnati."
41:44;41:47;"- I mean, I would love to be a fly on the wall,"
41:47;41:49;"yeah, like of the recording of this."
41:49;41:52;"Like you're in like a professional recording studio"
41:52;41:57;"in Cincinnati in like early '86, late '85,"
41:57;42:00;"and you're watching this dude like throw down the vocals."
42:00;42:05;"♪ I need that home equity loan for the family room ♪"
42:05;42:07;"I mean, boom!"
42:07;42:09;"- If you just played this for me and you said,"
42:09;42:10;"""What do you think the backstory is on this?"""
42:10;42:12;"I'd say, I would be like,"
42:12;42:17;"this was a demo that a major label paid for."
42:17;42:24;"It was recorded at a studio in the Valley in the mid '80s."
42:24;42:27;"This was recorded in Van Nuys."
42:27;42:29;"And they'd say, yeah, it was this guy,"
42:29;42:33;"he made some demos, he was supposed to release an album,"
42:33;42:35;"but something happened, he got dropped,"
42:35;42:37;"but it didn't work out."
42:37;42:41;"But actually a lot of the people who helped make this demo,"
42:41;42:45;"these are people who also played on Toto albums or something."
42:45;42:46;"You know what I mean?"
42:46;42:48;"It has that kind of vibe."
42:48;42:51;"- Lionel Richie thought about recording it."
42:51;42:51;"- Yeah."
42:51;42:55;"This is like when a friend of the show, Bruce Hornsby,"
42:55;42:56;"was like hanging out in the Valley,"
42:56;42:58;"just kind of like getting his (beep) together,"
42:58;43:01;"probably taking gigs here and there."
43:01;43:02;"And he told me, he's like,"
43:02;43:04;"""Yeah, I did one session with Hoodwink."
43:04;43:07;"I helped them arrange 'Boom!'"""
43:07;43:08;"It was a really good demo,"
43:08;43:10;"but they decided to leave it off the album."
43:10;43:14;"So in a sense, it's a very impressive piece of music."
43:14;43:15;"And it's memorable too."
43:15;43:17;"Normally, if you think about these weird compilations"
43:17;43:19;"you hear where somebody just throws"
43:19;43:21;"a bunch of local artists on, you know."
43:21;43:22;"- Oh yeah."
43:22;43:25;"- So much of it is just so deeply forgettable."
43:25;43:27;"There is something about this song."
43:27;43:30;"It has flavor and that pause, boom!"
43:30;43:32;"But let's talk more about the songwriting,"
43:32;43:35;"'cause I think in some ways that's the most TC element of it."
43:35;43:37;"- Yeah, the lyrics are just incredible."
43:37;43:39;"I don't think we have the lyrics, do we?"
43:39;43:42;"So we'll have to just start the song over."
43:42;43:44;"- Yeah, throw it on one more time."
43:44;43:47;"- Yeah, 'cause it's fast paced."
43:47;43:48;"I mean, you can miss a lot."
43:48;43:50;"- Yeah."
43:50;43:52;"- I mean, it's a guy looking back at his life"

45:22;45:25;"clearly, rock has changed."
45:25;45:29;"You've already seen the rise of punk, hardcore."
45:29;45:30;"- Disco, all of it, yeah."
45:30;45:33;"- I guess, as people have,"
45:33;45:35;"it's a cliched point now,"
45:35;45:39;"but people talk about the selfishness of the Boomers."
45:39;45:42;"You see the younger generations say this all the time."
45:42;45:44;"Although, to me, it's pretty clear"
45:44;45:48;"that the Boomerism is really just more like modern life."
45:48;45:51;"- It's just post-war consumer capitalism."
45:51;45:52;"- There's even a case to be made"
45:52;45:54;"that every generation's gotten more and more Boomer."
45:54;45:57;"It's all just sequels to Boomers,"
45:57;45:59;"as much as people love to,"
45:59;46:01;"including us, and want to talk about the differences."
46:01;46:03;"- I was talking about my grandmother,"
46:03;46:06;"coveting an orange on Christmas morning."
46:06;46:10;"But then her kids are all post-war babies"
46:10;46:14;"born in the bounty of American hegemony."
46:14;46:17;"And so, that's what the Boomers are."
46:17;46:20;"They were in the shining new city on the hill"
46:20;46:23;"of your life is defined by consumerism,"
46:23;46:25;"for better or worse."
46:25;46:28;"And since then, living in the same set of conditions."
46:28;46:30;"- People love to point out the,"
46:30;46:31;"""Well, yeah, Boomer,"
46:31;46:32;"""you could have bought a house for this much,"
46:32;46:34;"""and college was cheaper."""
46:34;46:37;"100%, these differences are not fake."
46:37;46:39;"There are legitimate differences."
46:39;46:42;"And even within generations, you can get this like if--"
46:42;46:43;"- Oh, absolutely."
46:43;46:46;"- Sometimes it's better to be 14"
46:46;46:51;"at when the economy collapses than 18 or 22."
46:51;46:52;"It really depends."
46:52;46:54;"That could really have a big difference on"
46:54;46:56;"when you're getting a job and things like that."
46:56;46:56;"So, these are all real."
46:56;46:58;"But I think when you go back to the,"
46:58;47:03;"""I got an orange, one orange a year mentality,"""
47:03;47:04;"these are all looks like people living"
47:04;47:07;"in the shining city on the hill."
47:07;47:09;"And I think the sad truth of human existence"
47:09;47:11;"is that people rarely feel that way."
47:11;47:13;"So, the idea that you would tell"
47:13;47:17;"like a member of Hoodwink type Boomer,"
47:17;47:19;"like, ""Oh, you guys had it so good."""
47:19;47:21;"There's a feeling of, you know,"
47:21;47:23;"it's like Billy Joel, ""We Didn't Start the Fire."""
47:23;47:25;"At some point, we got to talk about that song"
47:25;47:27;"'cause clearly similar energy."
47:27;47:28;"There's a feeling of,"
47:28;47:30;"you just grew up in the lap of luxury and abundance."
47:30;47:32;"People, it doesn't make any sense to them."
47:32;47:32;"What are you talking about?"
47:32;47:35;"JFK was killed when I was in middle school."
47:35;47:38;"I came of age in the craziest decade."
47:38;47:40;"There's a sense not of living in abundance,"
47:40;47:42;"but in a sense of living in chaos and social turmoil"
47:42;47:46;"and fighting for a new world to be born,"
47:46;47:50;"which I think is probably true of younger generations now."
47:50;47:52;"What year did ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" come out?"
47:52;47:53;"I was thinking about that."
47:53;47:55;"- I was gonna say, this is before that."
47:55;47:57;"That's like '90 or something."
47:57;47:57;"- No."
47:57;47:58;"- I think so."
47:58;48:01;"Seinfeld, ""Number Crunch,"" on ""We Didn't Start the Fire."""
48:01;48:03;"- 1989."
48:03;48:04;"- Okay."
48:04;48:06;"- Ah, got you, Jake."
48:06;48:07;"Just like I messed up."
48:07;48:11;"I called it as '80 for McCarney."
48:11;48:13;"All right, we're officially even."
48:13;48:14;"We'll need a tiebreaker."
48:14;48:16;"- We're all tied up."
48:16;48:19;"And they both hinge on nine and zero years."
48:19;48:20;"Anyway."
48:20;48:22;"- I think for people like us who love years,"
48:22;48:25;"the nine and zero can be a real danger zone."
48:25;48:26;"- Oh yeah."
48:26;48:28;"- When you're guessing what year something came out."
48:28;48:30;"Okay, so wow, this is significantly"
48:30;48:32;"before ""We Didn't Start the Fire."""
48:32;48:33;"'Cause what's interesting about it too"
48:33;48:36;"is that when you talk about ""Boys of Summer"""
48:36;48:38;"as a kind of like looking back from the '80s"
48:38;48:42;"towards the '60s, that's a beautiful song,"
48:42;48:46;"but it's eerie, sad, and wistful."
48:46;48:48;"And it's melancholy."
48:48;48:50;"- Right, and the details, I mean,"
48:50;48:52;"like the only really true vivid detail"
48:52;48:54;"in ""Boys of Summer"" is,"
48:54;48:58;"out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac."
48:58;49:00;"The rest of it is very vibey,"
49:00;49:02;"just like wayfarers, or just like you're on the beach,"
49:02;49:04;"and I jumped by your house."
49:04;49:06;"- And in some ways, if you take away"
49:06;49:08;"that the Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac,"
49:08;49:12;"really what you're left with is a very good,"
49:12;49:15;"I'd say excellent song that's in the tradition"
49:15;49:16;"of songs that there's always been"
49:16;49:19;"about time going by and youth passing."
49:19;49:23;"You know, I'm sure there are 15th century troubadours"
49:23;49:26;"more or less singing about the same themes"
49:26;49:29;"of eternal love in the face of,"
49:29;49:31;"it's like Shakespearean sonnet,"
49:31;49:35;"eternal love in the face of the devouring tooth of time."
49:35;49:37;"There's a superficial boomer element to it,"
49:37;49:39;"but it really is just a beautiful song"
49:39;49:43;"about remembering the past and saying,"
49:43;49:45;"""My love for you will still be strong"
49:45;49:47;"""even when summer's over"
49:47;49:49;"""and we approach the winter of our lives."""
49:49;49:52;"That's really some eternal thematic stuff."
49:52;49:55;"- What this has in common with ""We Didn't Start the Fire"""
49:55;49:58;"is a very unique slice of boomer cultural energy"
49:58;50:02;"that's angry and pumped up at the same time,"
50:02;50:05;"like hitting middle age in this kind of intense,"
50:05;50:07;"like, ""JFK, man of the year!"""
50:07;50:10;"- ""JFK blown away, what else do I have to say?"""
50:10;50:12;"- ""What else do I have to say?"""
50:12;50:14;"There is something pretty funny"
50:14;50:18;"about getting more fired up when you're 40."
50:18;50:19;"Some people mellow, or they're just like,"
50:19;50:22;"they have a deeper realization of what life's all about"
50:22;50:24;"when they hit middle age."
50:24;50:26;"Like, you know, you're an adult now,"
50:26;50:28;"you have family, things change,"
50:28;50:32;"you understand the cyclical nature of time, whatever."
50:32;50:35;"There's something about getting more fired up at 40."
50:35;50:37;"""What more do I have to say?"""
50:37;50:40;"Or this song, ""I was born in the boom!"""
50:40;50:41;"This and ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"""
50:41;50:43;"I can't think of too many other examples"
50:43;50:47;"of that particular slice of intense,"
50:47;50:51;"kind of angry boomer energy."
50:51;50:52;"It's unique."
50:52;50:54;"And anyway, I guess ""Hoodwink"" beat ""Billy"" to it"
50:54;50:58;"by at least three years, so there's really something."
50:58;51:02;"- I mean, I guess you could say ""Born in the USA"" by Bruce"
51:02;51:03;"has a little bit of that, but again,"
51:03;51:08;"it's poetry is just sort of deeper and not so,"
51:08;51:10;"I mean, it's pretty specific about, like, you know,"
51:10;51:13;"his buddies back in Saigon and all that, but."
51:13;51:16;"- Yeah, ""Born in the USA"" would hit so different"
51:16;51:18;"if instead of being about a guy who came back"
51:18;51:21;"all messed up from war and felt abandoned,"
51:21;51:24;"which in some ways is also a pretty classic theme"
51:24;51:27;"about the horrors of war and returning to life."
51:27;51:29;"Even the ancient Greeks were writing about that."
51:29;51:32;"But yeah, if instead of, you could totally picture it"
51:32;51:34;"if instead of being like, ""I went to Vietnam"
51:34;51:35;"""and I watched my friends get killed,"
51:35;51:38;"""and then I came back and I couldn't get a job,"""
51:38;51:41;"if instead it was just like a guy who never left New Jersey,"
51:41;51:42;"he was just kind of just like,"
51:42;51:44;"just generally had this sense of like,"
51:44;51:46;"""What the (beep) man?"

51:47;51:50;"From Woodstock to this, you know."

51:52;51:56;"watching the time slip by and things not pan out."
51:56;51:57;"But yeah, ""Born in the USA"" being rooted"
51:57;52:00;"in the war experience, that still, to me,"

52:10;52:14;"- Yeah, 'cause I think this energy of,"
52:14;52:16;"is more not like, ""I went to war"
52:16;52:19;"""and then I was abandoned by an ungrateful nation"

52:23;52:25;"It's another to be like,"
52:25;52:27;"and maybe it's even equally sad in a weird way"

52:30;52:33;"- I don't know if this song is angry though."

53:26;53:27;"Like, what is he?"
53:27;53:29;"- You would think in some ways,"
53:29;53:33;"he'd be the one kind of writing the road map"
53:33;53:34;"or like diagnosing it."
53:34;53:36;"But maybe already by '86,"
53:36;53:41;"they'd been talking about the end of the '60s for 15 years."
53:42;53:45;"I mean, even by '69,"
53:45;53:46;"maybe he is saying something like pretty sophisticated,"
53:46;53:47;"just kind of like,"
53:47;53:51;"there's something about his generation"
53:51;53:54;"where it felt almost like preordained."
53:54;53:57;"'Cause I think even when it happened,"
53:57;53:59;"we look backwards and people like us"
53:59;54:01;"who are interested in classic rock history,"
54:01;54:02;"you read about Altamont"
54:02;54:05;"and you might read a book in 2005 or something."
54:05;54:09;"It's like, now we look at the deaths"
54:09;54:11;"at the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont"
54:11;54:14;"as being the end of the '60s."
54:14;54:17;"But I think that people were saying that in the '60s,"
54:17;54:17;"like when it happened,"
54:17;54:18;"there was already a sense of like,"
54:18;54:20;"""Well, yeah, the promise of the hippies is over."""
54:20;54:24;"So maybe he's reflecting on this feeling"
54:24;54:29;"that because his generation was so like self-conscious,"
54:29;54:31;"people always have a sense of like,"
54:31;54:33;"""I'm young and other people are old."""
54:33;54:34;"And that's what maybe why the boomers"
54:34;54:37;"kicked off this whole new way of thinking about generations."
54:37;54:39;"Not everybody grew up where you had a hit song"
54:39;54:42;"called ""My Generation"" about your generation."
54:42;54:45;"Limp Bizkit fans had that."
54:45;54:47;"But again, the boomers created a new archetype."
54:47;54:49;"So maybe he's reflecting on this feeling"
54:49;54:52;"that like this was the first deeply,"
54:52;54:55;"deeply self-conscious generation."
54:55;54:58;"And when a generation is very self-conscious,"
54:58;55:01;"even as things unfold, it almost feels preordained"
55:01;55:03;"because people are like already talking about it"
55:03;55:06;"in historical terms, like something happens,"
55:06;55:08;"well, that was the end of that era."
55:08;55:10;"Maybe even today, people talk about vibe shifts,"
55:10;55:13;"just like something, just like, ""Yep, shifted."""
55:13;55:15;"- Is this the first generation where people felt"
55:15;55:18;"that they just inherited the previous generation's bull(beep)?"
55:18;55:20;"- Right, because maybe previous generations"
55:20;55:22;"saw themselves as being part of"
55:22;55:25;"some sort of historical continuity."
55:25;55:27;"'Cause of course, there's always been generational tension,"
55:27;55:30;"but yeah, maybe the idea that a generation"
55:30;55:35;"is truly distinct and like pushing off of the old one"

58:15;58:18;"Do we have any listeners in the Cincinnati area"
58:18;58:20;"who have any connection to this band?"
58:20;58:22;"Because our producers did some digging."
58:22;58:24;"There's a classic rock cover band in Cincinnati"
58:24;58:26;"called Hoodwink, but there doesn't seem to be"
58:26;58:28;"an affiliation between the two Hoodwinks."
58:28;58:30;"- Well, and I remember on the text thread"
58:30;58:33;"a few weeks ago, we found some guy's name."
58:33;58:35;"I don't have it in front of me."
58:35;58:37;"And we were Googling him and we found some guy"
58:37;58:40;"that was like a county commissioner."
58:40;58:41;"- A lawyer."
58:41;58:44;"- Yeah, or something in like the Lexington, Kentucky area,"
58:44;58:47;"which I think is across the river from Cincinnati."
58:47;58:49;"- He was part of a charity."
58:49;58:49;"- Right."
58:49;58:52;"- We found a name of a member of Hoodwink"
58:52;58:55;"and then we ran it through our advanced computer system."
58:55;58:57;"And we found that there's somebody who shares that name"
58:57;59:02;"who is part of some sort of Lexington, Kentucky event"
59:02;59:06;"where local kind of white collar lawyers"
59:06;59:08;"and business people play rock music"
59:08;59:10;"to raise money for charity."
59:10;59:12;"So that's a promising lead."
59:12;59:16;"- Is it possible that that person's name was Stephen Howard?"
59:16;59:17;"- I don't remember."
59:17;59:19;"- Sounds possible."
59:19;59:22;"- Are you digging back into the time crisis text thread?"
59:22;59:25;"- You know, I did a cold Google search"
59:25;59:28;"and I found a Hoodwink Cincinnati Facebook page"
59:28;59:30;"with 59 likes."
59:30;59:32;"- That's probably the current classic rock cover band,"
59:32;59:33;"I would imagine."
59:33;59:35;"- Is there really no affiliation?"
59:35;59:36;"- Matt found it."
59:36;59:42;"So it's Hoodwink on bass is somebody named Mike Scharf,"
59:42;59:47;"percussion, David Michael Zanders,"
59:47;59:51;"guitar, Ted Karras, keyboards, Jay Gilbert."
59:51;59:53;"- Oh, Rick Marksberry."
59:53;59:54;"- That was the name."
59:54;59:56;"(laughing)"

01:00:05;01:00:07;"- Okay, wow."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- Or like, what was that episode we did"
01:00:09;01:00:14;"where we talked to that guy in Colorado about his,"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"like the guy that played in that Connecticut fusion band"
01:00:17;01:00:20;"with Michael, that was like gigged with Michael Bolton."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"- Oh yeah, that was a great band."
01:00:21;01:00:25;"- And like his son or someone like heard the episode"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"and then, didn't we talk to him or something?"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"I'm trying to remember."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"- Yeah, it was about how he'd been sampled by DJ Shadow"
01:00:31;01:00:35;"and how he got like 50 grand."
01:00:35;01:00:35;"- Well, they sent an email."

01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Right, no, Gen X is sort of like,"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"yeah, '90s culture, you know."

01:03:33;01:03:35;"- Pavement and Quentin Tarantino is-"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- Yeah, in some ways we associate,"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"Gen X sounds more like a descriptor"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"of the culture those people created as adults."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"- Right."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"- Or at least as young adults consuming culture."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"Whereas the baby boomer generation,"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"you'd be cooler if their name had something less to do"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"with just being born by,"
01:03:54;01:03:57;"when horny soldiers came home"
01:03:57;01:04:02;"and were ready to have children after fighting abroad."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"If it had something more to do with the culture"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"they experienced in the '60s or something,"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"if you're like the Aquarian generation or the-"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"- Right."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"- Or even the Woodstock generation is corny in its own way."

01:04:17;01:04:20;"But anyway, I thought I'd make a difference,"

01:04:21;01:04:23;"I wonder what, and this is actually going back"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"to our discussion about what is the tone of the song"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"that becomes important?"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"'Cause there's a way to frame that positively."

01:04:46;01:04:48;"and the larger forces of history."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"And now here I am, I have my own baby."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"And now the cycle starts anew."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"And I'm gonna let go of all this cultural baggage"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"of the last 40 years,"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"'cause I understand everything's cyclical."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"I was a baby boomer, now I'm the person,"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"I was part of the baby boom, now I'm having a baby."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"There's almost a way to look at it as like,"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"ah, I think I understand something a bit more"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"about life now."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"But again, I'd have a baby instead, boom!"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"I mean- - So intense."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- Maybe that's what gives this song"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"that sort of amateur sheen,"
01:05:19;01:05:23;"is that there is no real clear perspective."
01:05:23;01:05:27;"Like we can't tell how this guy feels about any of this."
01:05:27;01:05:32;"Like there's no real coherent worldview."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"It's just sort of like stuff happened."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"- Which maybe is what makes it great art."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"It's like a primal scream."
01:05:38;01:05:42;"Yeah, maybe it's lacking the storytelling"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"of a ""Born in the USA"" or a ""Boys of Summer."""
01:05:45;01:05:48;"And it doesn't have that kind of professional sheen,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"obviously, if we didn't start the fire."
01:05:50;01:05:54;"But it's a mix of like anger, joy, confusion."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"It's real in that sense."
01:05:56;01:05:59;"- Hey guys, Matt has been putting in the work"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"behind the scenes here,"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"and it looks like he's uncovered a Rick Marksbury band"
01:06:03;01:06:07;"circa 2007 that is on Apple Music."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- Oh, throw it on."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"- It's a band called Retroactive"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"that's been together- - Love it."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- For eight years, I guess before 2007."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Yeah, let's hear some of this."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"- Do we think Rick Marksbury"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"was the primary songwriter of ""Hoodwink""?"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"Is ""Boom"" like his baby?"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"- Well, wait, he's confirmed the vocalist here?"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"- Yes, Rick Marksbury was lead vocals on ""Boom,"""
01:06:28;01:06:29;"according to Discogs."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"- I mean, the way he's singing it,"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"it really sounds like he takes ownership,"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"like you can feel that ownership."

01:08:15;01:08:16;"- Okay."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- Maybe he's a versatile singer"
01:08:20;01:08:24;"and he can kind of do different approaches."

01:09:09;01:09:14;"And so is Rick Marksbury the one who's maybe a lawyer"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"in Lexington, Kentucky now?"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"- Well, oh wait, he might be."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"He might've died."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"- Oh."
01:09:20;01:09:24;"- Matt said something, sent over a obituary."
01:09:24;01:09:29;"Rick Marksbury, June 3rd, 1954 to March 3rd, 2012."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- Is that a different Rick Marksbury?"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"- Is there any information?"
01:09:32;01:09:36;"- Well, Rick Marksbury, 57, passed away on 2012."
01:09:36;01:09:40;"Not really."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"I mean, he's- - I can't do it, guys."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"- I mean, no, it's a Cincinnati"
01:09:43;01:09:47;"and Kentucky based Rick Marksbury."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"- That's possible."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"I mean, the spelling of Rick being R-I-C,"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"lacking the K is a bit of a tell."
01:09:54;01:09:57;"- Man, I'm looking at an obituary that,"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"no, wait, what are these years?"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"These years don't seem right."
01:10:00;01:10:04;"I'm looking at one where the years say 1967 to 2022."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"- Well, that's weird 'cause I'm looking at one"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"from, no, '54 to 2012."
01:10:08;01:10:12;"- I found a Rick Marksbury who's a retired inspector"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"for the Northern Kentucky Health Department."
01:10:14;01:10:17;"- That's what I've, I found that guy."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"- Yeah, I think this is our guy."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"I think- - I think so too."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"- So he died?"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- No, no, no, I think he's a-"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"- He's still alive."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"- A retired health inspector."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"That's, I remember finding that guy a few weeks ago"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"when we were texting about this."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- The Beachwood High School, 1971."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Okay, this must be him."
01:10:34;01:10:37;"Rick Marksbury, he was a musician,"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"studied literature and language"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"at Northern Kentucky University,"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"Beachwood High School, class of '71."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"This sounds like our guy."
01:10:44;01:10:48;"- Well, maybe for the first episode next year,"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"we try to get Rick Marksbury to call in"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"and really get to the bottom of this song."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"- I'd love to know more about where he was coming from"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"on this song and clearly a talented guy."
01:11:00;01:11:02;"I'd love to, yeah, just hear his story."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Well, hopefully we can find out."
01:11:04;01:11:09;"If anybody listening is gonna be maybe spending Christmas"
01:11:09;01:11:13;"in Southern Ohio or Kentucky"
01:11:13;01:11:17;"and wants a bit of a mission, help us out."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Let's track down Marksbury."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"- Listen to the end of the song again and just-"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"- Go on to the top five."

01:11:39;01:11:41;"Like, it's not just like, oh, he's pretty good."
01:11:41;01:11:45;"This type of singing, this like, kinda classic rock,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"♪ I was born in a boom ♪"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"- I mean, there's a lot of soul in that,"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"like soul music in that scene too."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"That's why I was like, it's hard for me to pin down"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"the race of the singer."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"It's like kinda raceless."
01:11:57;01:12:04;"- Next year, first question for Rick Marksbury, race."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"- All I'm saying is like, that singing is on par"
01:12:07;01:12:12;"with like anybody from like a rock band of that era."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"You know, it's like, it's real rock singing"
01:12:14;01:12:18;"with like range, soul, depth."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"It's not just like some, you know,"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"discovering some cool like lo-fi classic,"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"like Daniel Johnston type thing,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"which is, you know, amazing in its own way,"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"but you're like, oh yeah, well, of course this was,"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"you know, this is somebody like a real professional singer."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"- Yeah."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"- All right, so let's get into the top five."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"- Let's do top five."
01:12:35;01:12:40;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:12:40;01:12:45;"- So this week, because it's the end of the year,"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"for the top five, we decided,"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"and actually this was a suggestion, right?"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"From a--"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"- Someone on Twitter."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- This was a suggestion from a listener."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- Yeah."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"- Somebody named Alex said,"
01:12:55;01:12:59;"when do we do our top five Apple Music"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"kind of year end stuff?"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"'Cause they give that to you."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"- This is interesting 'cause this is truly,"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"I have no idea what might be in Jake's,"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"and you, I'm sure, have no idea what might be in mine."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"The one thing I'll say is I've noticed"
01:13:13;01:13:17;"with these streaming platform year end things,"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"because a lot of people, especially maybe younger people,"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"it's an exciting thing, you get to share"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"and show what you've been listening to and stuff like that."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"I imagine for you and me, Jake,"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"as us guys who are halfway to our tomb,"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"we don't put much thought in curating"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"(laughs)"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"our streaming listening."
01:13:35;01:13:40;"And also you and I both listen on other platforms as well."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"- Yeah, records and yeah."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"- Our whole life doesn't revolve around only streaming."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"So I imagine for you, certainly for me,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"it's not like this curated, like,"
01:13:50;01:13:54;"well, this year I was really into this new record"
01:13:54;01:13:55;"and that's the one I listened to the most."
01:13:55;01:13:56;"And of course you're gonna see,"
01:13:56;01:13:59;"I spent a lot of time digging into the catalog of who,"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"it's not gonna be like that."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"- Do you think people are like,"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"in like, you know, February and March of a given year"
01:14:05;01:14:10;"are like thinking about what their year end playlists,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"social media share is gonna look like?"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"And they're-"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"- Yes, I do."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"- Wow."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"That's absolutely psychotic."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"- I bet you especially get it in November"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"where you probably have some people who,"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"you enjoy that and they start jamming in stuff"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"that they think is better for their brand."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"This to me is a very like,"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"like kind of revealing of like my private habits"
01:14:33;01:14:36;"or, you know, my soul,"
01:14:36;01:14:40;"because I'm never thinking about the year end rap"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"when I'm listening to music on a streaming service."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"- Maybe you should start."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"- I was surprised to see the five songs"
01:14:47;01:14:50;"that were my top five listens."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Although I will say a little bit kind of,"
01:14:53;01:14:58;"it's a similar analog to your theory on the Grammys"
01:14:58;01:15:02;"being weighted towards the A, Bs and Cs."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"A lot of this music in my top five"
01:15:04;01:15:08;"were songs I kind of engaged with or discovered"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"in the early part of the year,"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"because I make like every year,"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"I start like a 2022 playlist."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And if I hear a song that I like,"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"it could be new, it could be old,"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"but kind of new to me,"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"I'll put it to the 2022 playlist."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"So a lot of the stuff, I think these five songs"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"are songs that I discovered,"
01:15:26;01:15:30;"you know, say Q1 or two of this year."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"- And it's at the start of the playlist."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"So every time you throw on the playlist."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- Exactly, or I usually just hit shuffle,"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"but it's usually when I don't know what to listen to"
01:15:36;01:15:39;"and I'm just in the car or I'm working and painting,"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"I'll just like, oh yeah,"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"I got like 20 songs on this playlist"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"that I'm feeling right now."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"Let me just hit shuffle."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"And you know, the songs that I put on"
01:15:47;01:15:51;"in January, February, March, I'm going to hear more."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"- I see."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"- So this is really a snapshot of me,"
01:15:53;01:15:56;"I would say the first half of 2022."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- Well, let's get into it."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"Let's see what we're talking about."
01:15:58;01:16:01;"So I guess we're starting with your number five, Jake."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"- Yeah."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"- Paul Westerberg, ""Mr. Rabbit."""
01:16:06;01:16:09;"- Oh, interesting."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"- Paul Westerberg from The Replacements."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"- Yes."
01:16:11;01:16:15;"I'm learning things already."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"The songwriter is a traditional."

01:16:41;01:16:42;"His voice sounds great."
01:16:42;01:16:46;"I mean, I love The Replacements, like everybody,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"but know basically nothing"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"about Paul Westerberg's solo career."
01:16:50;01:16:53;"So this is from his fourth solo album."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"- Yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"- Well, how'd you get into this song, Jake?"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"- I heard it."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"No, like- - You just heard it?"
01:16:59;01:16:59;"- I heard it."
01:16:59;01:17:03;"Hannah had some random playlist playing in the house"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"and I was like, ""What is this?"""
01:17:05;01:17:09;"And I was like, ""I gotta add this to my playlist."""
01:17:09;01:17:10;"- Yeah."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"- And I've been listening to it all year."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"- Do you know any other Paul Westerberg solo songs?"
01:17:14;01:17:15;"- No. - Can you name one?"

01:17:21;01:17:22;"""All right, man, look at you."""
01:17:22;01:17:24;"- I gotta check this out."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"- Yeah, this guy's always good."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- I've been listening to the song all year"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"and I was like, to me, it was like such a timeless song."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"It almost reminds me of like a Hank Williams song"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"or something."
01:17:34;01:17:34;"- Well, there you go. - It's interesting."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"- It's a traditional."

01:18:30;01:18:32;"like the voicings on the chords and stuff"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"are not really traditional."
01:18:34;01:18:37;"Anyway, that song rips."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- My number five."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"See, I thought about if I should like curate this more,"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"but whatever, I left it raw."
01:18:42;01:18:47;"Number five, Bob Dylan, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."""
01:18:47;01:18:48;"- Hell yeah, dude."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"- Okay, wait, how many plays?"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Oh, I don't have that written down."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"- Oh, I had mine."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"I think the Paul Westerberg was like 20 or something."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"- Yeah, it'd probably be something similar."

01:19:15;01:19:17;"That was like seven or eight."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"So this part of me wanted to curate it"
01:19:19;01:19:22;"and just switch out Brownsville Girl to talk about,"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"but no, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."""
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- I mean, we talked about Brownsville Girl"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"for like 45 minutes, so."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- Yeah."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"I mean, yeah, what more can you say about this one, though?"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."""
01:19:34;01:19:36;"What's bringing you back to this song"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"so many times this year?"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"- I do think I listen to it a lot,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"but I was just listening to so much Bob Dylan"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"this year is the truth."
01:19:42;01:19:46;"And I think a lot of times when you get to the end"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"of a Bob Dylan album,"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"it might auto-play into this or something."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"I think this, I don't know."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"(laughing)"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"- That's so much less inspiring."
01:19:55;01:19:59;"- Yeah, and I do listen to this song a bunch."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"And I just remember putting it on in the house"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"and listening to it with the family."

01:20:13;01:20:20;"♪ And what did you see, my darling young one ♪"
01:20:20;01:20:25;"- Also, at some point, I remember when we first got to Japan,"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"I was like, and because I'd seen Bob Dylan play"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"at Fuji Rock Festival a few years ago,"
01:20:30;01:20:33;"I think I was researching Bob Dylan's history in Japan,"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"'cause he's toured here quite a bit."
01:20:34;01:20:38;"He had the live record in the '70s."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"And somehow I came across a video on YouTube,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"which I kind of recommend,"
01:20:44;01:20:48;"which is him playing at this famous temple in the city,"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"Nara, where you might've heard of it."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"It's like, there's these deer that roam around."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"If you've ever seen a picture of somebody visiting Japan"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"surrounded by deer, it's probably at Nara."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"And so Bob played in front of this famous temple"
01:20:59;01:21:02;"that has a really striking, amazing,"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"huge Buddha statue inside."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"But he's playing at the outside of,"
01:21:05;01:21:09;"they had some sort of event in the '90s"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"where Bob played with an orchestra."
01:21:11;01:21:14;"And there's like this slightly schmaltzy,"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"but still moving version of ""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,"""
01:21:17;01:21:21;"just like Bob in the '90s in Japan with an orchestra."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"So I remember kind of watching that"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"and then took me back to the song,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"which of course I've listened to many times in my life."

01:21:32;01:21:35;"♪ And what did you hear, my darling young one ♪"
01:21:35;01:21:40;"- Well, it's resonant that him playing this song in Japan,"
01:21:40;01:21:45;"you know, 50 years after Nagasaki and Hiroshima."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"- Right, 'cause at the time,"
01:21:47;01:21:50;"a lot of people interpreted ""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall"""
01:21:50;01:21:53;"as being about nuclear war."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"The cool thing about Dylan is,"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"I think it's a flexible metaphor."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"So you can imagine this 1963,"
01:21:58;01:22:02;"it's like, it probably seemed like a hard rain."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"Yeah, it sounds like nuclear bombs,"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"but in an even more mystical way,"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"it's also just like, things are gonna get weird."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"I've been out there in this world"

01:22:18;01:22:20;"""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall."""
01:22:20;01:22:22;"- Yeah, it could be frogs falling from the sky"
01:22:22;01:22:25;"or, you know, nuclear winter."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"- Right."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"- But yeah, the fact that this was released in '63,"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"so presumably recorded in '62,"
01:22:31;01:22:35;"I mean, Cuban Missile Crisis, I mean, you know."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"- When did JFK die?"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Was that late '63?"
01:22:38;01:22:41;"- November 22nd, '63."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"So this was released before--"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"- That's pretty wild."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"- Yeah."
01:22:44;01:22:47;"- In 1963, this probably was a lot of people's favorite song"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"of the year or like a song they spent a lot of time with."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"- Yeah."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"- When people were getting their year-end streaming metrics"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"back at the end of '63,"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"they were still reeling from the assassination of JFK"

01:23:00;01:23:02;"""Damn, the song I listened to the most this year"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"was called 'A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall.'"""

01:23:06;01:23:07;"When you really put it that way,"
01:23:07;01:23:10;"no wonder he was seen as not just an excellent songwriter,"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"but like an almost spookily prophetic dude."

01:25:16;01:25:18;"I went, and so in February,"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"'cause I saw this on my playlist and I was like,"

01:25:21;01:25:24;"In February of 2022,"

01:25:27;01:25:29;"at Friend of the Show, Tom Sharpling's house."
01:25:29;01:25:34;"And I went with Friend of the Show, Daniel Ralston."

01:25:40;01:25:41;"I didn't know that Meat Loaf song."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"I was like, what was that?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"And he was like, dude, two out of three ain't bad."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"You don't know."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"I was like, I don't know that one."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"And then- - Oh, you literally"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"didn't know it."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- I didn't know the song."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"I mean, it was very vaguely familiar."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"- Did we listen to it on the show?"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Because I feel like I didn't know it that well"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"until recently in my life either."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"- He was singing it and I was sort of like,"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"oh, this is vaguely familiar."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"You know that thing of like,"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"oh, I kind of know this song,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"but it's kind of hitting me right now."

01:26:06;01:26:10;"We get in the car to drive back to Highland Park"
01:26:10;01:26:11;"or whatever, Eagle Rock."
01:26:11;01:26:14;"And I put the song on, on Apple Music."
01:26:14;01:26:17;"And then I have it at very low volume."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"And then we're talking the entire way."
01:26:18;01:26:22;"It's like a solid 25 minute drive"

01:37:35;01:37:35;"- Yeah."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"- I mean, I'm trying to think just like,"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"what would I put on just if people ask me to just like-"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"- Some terrible label."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"- Well, no, it's not even like something"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"that I think is cool."
01:37:45;01:37:48;"Or I don't know, I'd probably put on like ""Bah, Wada, Bah."""
01:37:48;01:37:51;"I do kind of like entry-level troll choices."

01:48:16;01:48:18;"- Wait, how do you have an English cousin?"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"How have we never talked about this?"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"When did your family leave England?"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Like 300 years ago?"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"- I'm picturing one of those movies"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"where it's like exactly the same as Jake, but it's British."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"Like, so you're British, like, bizarro."
01:48:32;01:48:36;"- No, I don't know why."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Someone went back at some point."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"It was on my mom's side."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"- Okay, someone went back."
01:48:42;01:48:42;"That makes more sense."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"- My mom has first cousins who are British"
01:48:45;01:48:50;"and their children are like my, around my age."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"Right, and this guy, Francis, who's a singer,"
01:48:53;01:48:57;"I think he's a bass in the choir of King's College, Cambridge."
01:48:57;01:49:02;"He visited the United States in '94 or '93,"
01:49:02;01:49:05;"and he stayed with us for a few days."
01:49:05;01:49:08;"And he was a few years older than me."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"And like, a cool guy. - He gave you"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"the first Radiohead album?"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"- Well, no, dude, check this out."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- He handed you Pablo Honey and said,"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"""These guys are one to watch, man."""
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- No, dude, he started me playing guitar."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"This was like legendary in the family lore"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"'cause I had taken guitar lessons,"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"but I was like eight or nine classical guitar lessons"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"and it sucked 'cause you were trying to read music"
01:49:28;01:49:32;"and pick out Beethoven things, and it was boring as hell."
01:49:32;01:49:37;"And then he strung up the guitar when he was visiting us,"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"and he started playing Metallica songs"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"and Fugazi songs."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"And I was like, ""What?"""
01:49:43;01:49:44;"And Nirvana songs."
01:49:44;01:49:47;"And I was like, and the Nirvana songs were easy,"
01:49:47;01:49:48;"so he showed me how to play them."
01:49:48;01:49:51;"Just like, this is a G, this is an E minor,"
01:49:51;01:49:54;"this is a D, this is how you play ""Poly"" by Nirvana."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"And this was in like '93 or something."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"And I was like, ""I'm in, I'm playing guitar now."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"""Now I'm like 16, let's go."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"""I wanna do this."""
01:50:04;01:50:05;"And anyway, this guy, Francis,"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"who I haven't seen in like decades,"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"maybe we should have him call in."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Cousin Francis."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"- What's up, dude?"
01:50:13;01:50:18;"- So out of a movie, just like kinda all-American,"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"crunchy dude like Jake, you're just like,"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"""Cousin Francis from England?"""
01:50:22;01:50:24;"- Hello, Jacob."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"- Yeah, we went down to like New Haven,"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"and we went to like a minor league baseball game"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"in New Haven, and then we went to this cool record store"
01:50:31;01:50:36;"called Cutler's, and he bought the new Fugazi album on tape."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"And we were blasting that in my house for a few days."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"- So did he go to Cambridge?"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"How do you become part of the King's Cod?"
01:50:43;01:50:44;"- I don't know, I don't know,"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"but my parents are always like,"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"""Your cousin Francis, he sings bass"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"""in the King's Choir of Cambridge."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"""He must have gone there."""
01:50:51;01:50:52;"- I'm gonna make a playlist"
01:50:52;01:50:56;"of the extended Longstreth family universe."
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Some Mountain Brew, some Dirty Projectors,"
01:50:58;01:51:01;"a little bit of King's College Cambridge Choir."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"- Hell yeah."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"- That's a very famous choir,"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"and it's a very famous cathedral, I guess."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"'Cause I was watching something else on YouTube,"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"some other like hymn that I like,"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"and you know, these beautiful shots of King's College"
01:51:15;01:51:16;"and what it actually looks like."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"It's really cool, you know?"
01:51:18;01:51:19;"- Yeah."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"- It looks like kind of like bones or something, the ceiling."
01:51:21;01:51:26;"It's a specific type of like English cathedral roof style."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"It's like a very special building."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Anyway, that's cool that he's,"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"wow, your cousin Francis, man, who knew?"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Definitely let's get him to call in."
01:51:34;01:51:37;"- He's probably like 49."
01:51:37;01:51:41;"Let's talk Fugazi and Metallica, let's go."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"- You still a big Fugazi fan?"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"Yeah, maybe cousin Francis wants to talk,"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"I think Metallica just dropped a new song last week."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"You hear it, Jake?"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- I didn't hear it, no."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"- Just like hit up Francis for the first time in a while."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"Hey man, wanna come on to my internet radio show"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"and talk the new Metallica, Lux Aeterna?"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"- Oh man."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"- Okay, Jake, your number one song."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"- No shocker here."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"- Your top five, very on brand."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"- Oh yeah."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"- I think when Lizzie starts like requesting songs more,"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"you'll definitely be,"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"it'll have a slightly different flavor,"
01:52:13;01:52:17;"but Jake's number one song could not be more on brand."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"Guided by Voices, Crystal Nunn's Cathedral,"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"the title track from the album of the same name."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"- Released March."

01:54:17;01:54:21;"you got into like a new album from them in a while?"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- Yeah, I really liked this whole record."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"This is the closing track."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"And I listened to this song on repeat."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"I remember one day when I was working,"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"I probably listened to it like 10 times in a row."
01:54:30;01:54:32;"I was so into it one day."
01:54:32;01:54:36;"It says I listened to this 39 times this year,"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"which is a lot."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"But it is only a minute and a half."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"But I think 10 of those was like one day."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"But yes, I did get in very into this record."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"- Return to form for GBV."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"- Kind of."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Some of the records I'll listen to once or twice"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"and not really return to,"
01:54:50;01:54:53;"but those are putting out like two or three a year."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"They have a new one coming out next January"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"called La La Land."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"- Can't wait for it."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Number 36."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"(laughs)"
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- Can't wait."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- My number one song."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- Let's go."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"- This one's funny 'cause this is,"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"yeah, my top five is definitely all a bit random,"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"but this one's a,"
01:55:09;01:55:09;"it's kind of a hybrid"
01:55:09;01:55:12;"'cause this is a song I legitimately do really like."
01:55:12;01:55:16;"It also became part of like a bit of like a family ritual."
01:55:16;01:55:20;"I don't know why these things happen around bath time."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"So it definitely got a lot more plays that way."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"People might've heard of the,"
01:55:23;01:55:27;"some people call the music genre, zam rock,"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"a 70s phenomenon combining traditional African music"
01:55:29;01:55:33;"with psychedelic rock, garage rock, blues and funk."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"And this is the, I don't know exactly how to say it."
01:55:35;01:55:38;"I think it's Ngozi family."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"And the song is called ""Hi Babe."""
01:55:40;01:55:42;"You ever heard any of this kind of music, Jake?"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"- I don't know."
01:55:47;01:55:54;"- It's a lot of good music from Zambia in the 70s."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"- I'm more up on that kind of Ethiopian kind of stuff"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"or like."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"- This is a bit like hard rock."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"- I don't know this."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"- I get some places."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"- Is that a guitar doing that chord progression?"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"- Yeah."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"Yeah, crazy tone."
