00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:09;"Rock gods Eddie Vedder and Nicky Sixx are beefing."
00:09;00:14;"Pam and Tommy is taking over television screens everywhere."
00:14;00:20;"Paul Abdul, Trent Reznor, their music stands the test of time."
00:20;00:24;"We'll be talking about all this and more on this week's"
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:29;"Check it!"
00:29;00:34;"Time Crisis"
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave me lonely babe"
01:16;01:20;"Wow Jake, it's pretty amazing that we're both cracking a Corona without discussing"
01:20;01:24;"because I actually have quite a bit of beer in my fridge"
01:24;01:26;"left over from my Super Bowl party."
01:26;01:27;"Right."
01:27;01:30;"So I could have grabbed a Stella, a Modelo"
01:30;01:34;"but I just thought a Corona would go best with the Megabytes."
01:34;01:36;"It's the best looking beer."
01:36;01:39;"Yeah, an attractive bottle."
01:39;01:41;"Alright, let's start the show for real though."
01:41;01:42;"Okay."
01:42;01:47;"Time Crisis, post-Super Bowl, Jake congratulations on the big win."
01:47;01:48;"Thank you."
01:48;01:55;"As a city of Los Angeles resident, I know you felt really proud that the Rams took it home."
01:55;01:57;"I was fired up man."
01:58;02:03;"Plus the hometown musical tribute, Golden Oldies."
02:03;02:04;"I mean that was cool."
02:04;02:05;"Yeah."
02:05;02:10;"Maybe just because a lot of the LA born and raised people I know are music people."
02:10;02:14;"So I felt like, alright, if their team doesn't win,"
02:14;02:19;"at least they got to see some of their musical heroes do a tribute to their hometown."
02:19;02:26;"Yeah, and not to blow up your spot, but I feel like most of the people at your Super Bowl party were there to see the halftime show."
02:26;02:28;"People made that very clear."
02:28;02:31;"It was not a football crazy crowd."
02:31;02:32;"No."
02:32;02:34;"Was there any football fan there?"
02:34;02:35;"There were some football fans."
02:35;02:37;"Anyone glued to the television?"
02:37;02:38;"CT?"
02:38;02:40;"CT came through."
02:40;02:41;"He knows a lot about football."
02:41;02:42;"So does Bale."
02:42;02:43;"Bale was there."
02:43;02:45;"I just think, you know what?"
02:45;02:46;"There were people who liked football."
02:46;02:54;"There was nobody at my Super Bowl party who particularly had an attachment to one of the teams playing."
02:54;02:55;"You know what I mean?"
02:55;02:56;"Yeah."
02:56;02:58;"It was neither a Rams nest nor a Bengals den."
02:58;03:05;"I would wager that 90% of the people there could not name the QB of the Rams."
03:05;03:06;"Including me."
03:06;03:07;"Wait."
03:07;03:11;"Joe Burrow was the Bengals."
03:11;03:13;"Can you name the QB of the Rams?"
03:13;03:14;"No."
03:14;03:19;"I watch the game so seriously and I have no idea who the QB is."
03:19;03:20;"Is it like Brocko?"
03:20;03:21;"No, no, no, Brocko."
03:21;03:23;"It was Matt Stafford."
03:23;03:25;"No, it was Brock Hampton."
03:25;03:27;"All of them?"
03:27;03:28;"No, no."
03:28;03:29;"It's a guy named Brock Hampton."
03:29;03:31;"You don't remember at the University of Oklahoma?"
03:31;03:32;"He was great."
03:32;03:33;"You want to know?"
03:33;03:34;"This reminds me."
03:34;03:41;"I was talking with Ezra about that Odell Beckham getting, this was maybe two weeks ago, when"
03:41;03:43;"he lost all of his money."
03:43;03:44;"Do you know about this, Jake?"
03:44;03:45;"No."
03:45;03:47;"Ezra, you might want to explain."
03:47;03:54;"My understanding is that Odell Beckham Jr. chose to get paid in Bitcoin and on top of"
03:54;03:58;"that he already had a heavily incentivized deal where his base salary was relatively"
03:58;03:59;"low."
03:59;04:04;"Bottom line, due to depreciation of Bitcoin, there are all these articles saying Odell"
04:04;04:10;"Beckham Jr., famous world-class athlete, got paid $35,000 this season."
04:10;04:14;"I don't know if that's true, but people are like, ""Ha ha, you made a big mistake."""
04:14;04:15;"Is he a football player?"
04:15;04:17;"Yeah, he was on the Rams."
04:17;04:18;"Okay."
04:18;04:22;"Well, Bitcoin's only down maybe 50 or 60%."
04:22;04:24;"It's not down that much."
04:24;04:26;"It was a tax thing though, wasn't it?"
04:26;04:28;"It was also a tax thing, but then he won the Super Bowl."
04:28;04:29;"I don't know."
04:29;04:30;"He's already rich."
04:30;04:35;"But the story outside of that was that Ezra and I were talking about it and he's like,"
04:35;04:40;"""God, it seems like $750,000 for one of the best players in the NFL."
04:40;04:41;"That seems so low."""
04:41;04:44;"He goes, ""Let me check in with my football text thread."""
04:44;04:45;"Oh yeah, that's right."
04:45;04:49;"I did like the idea that Ezra is on a football text thread."
04:49;04:50;"That's surprising."
04:50;04:57;"I'm on a football text thread, but it's tough because a lot of the guys in my crew, I mean,"
04:57;05:01;"I've talked about this on the show before, Bayo and CT, that's maybe the one team that"
05:01;05:05;"we all care about is the G-Men, the New York Giants."
05:05;05:11;"Because as everybody knows, New York, we're all from the New York area or the tri-state"
05:11;05:13;"area, but as everybody knows, New York has so many different teams."
05:13;05:18;"So, for instance, CT, he grew up loving the New Jersey Nets."
05:18;05:20;"Then he moves to Brooklyn."
05:20;05:21;"Well, guess what?"
05:21;05:22;"The Nets are coming with you."
05:22;05:25;"He loves the Nets, but I'm more of a Knicks guy."
05:25;05:31;"But whatever, the Giants are our shared interest, but they've had a really rough few years."
05:31;05:32;"Got a new coach coming in."
05:32;05:33;"I'm excited."
05:33;05:34;"Anyway."
05:34;05:37;"Were people there for the commercials as much as the halftime show?"
05:37;05:38;"Yeah, a little bit."
05:38;05:43;"But when Jake came to the party, I tried to make it COVID friendly, so I brought a TV"
05:43;05:45;"outside and there was one inside."
05:45;05:50;"And when Jake came, I explained to him, I was like, ""So listen, if you're comfortable"
05:50;05:55;"going inside, it's cooler, there's air conditioning, and there's a nicer TV."
05:55;05:59;"I got this little one outside, but you get to be outside, but the TV's not as good."""
05:59;06:00;"And Jake said, ""You know what?"
06:00;06:03;"It just doesn't matter because I don't give a shit about the game."""
06:03;06:04;"And I was like, ""All right, man."""
06:04;06:09;"We should have made Jake a special edition Super Bowl t-shirt that says, ""Breaking News."
06:09;06:11;"I don't give a shit about the Super Bowl."""
06:11;06:15;"Jake walks into the coffee shop Monday after Super Bowl Sunday."
06:15;06:16;"""Don't talk to me."""
06:17;06:19;"Give me the rocket and I'ma show you all the ways to be the MVP."
06:19;06:21;"Even if you on the bench, you still can't check me."
06:21;06:22;"See, I was born for this."
06:22;06:24;"I ain't the type to sweat technique."
06:24;06:26;"And I ain't waiting for a cut, you better accept me."
06:26;06:27;"You dig?"
06:27;06:29;"I can hit a ball, I don't get checked."
06:29;06:31;"Take it to the house like I'm trick daddy."
06:31;06:34;"Just skipping through the lane, nigga, ain't badly."
06:34;06:36;"But I'm posed for the camera when it gets flashy."
06:36;06:38;"If you don't know my body, take your vitamins."
06:38;06:41;"Got the bench wired like Natasha Hideman."
06:41;06:43;"Plays to make it, could be conk aspiring."
06:43;06:45;"Next possession point like I'm LaMelo, then I'm firing."
06:45;06:47;"Bam, grab those wild on the man."
06:47;06:50;"Baby, I'm the coach so you know I had a plan."
06:50;06:52;"If you wanna stop, you better have a diagram."
06:52;06:55;"I was number one before the season had began."
06:55;07:00;"Boy, you make me wanna, wanna, boy, you make me wanna, wanna,"
07:00;07:04;"boy, you make me wanna, wanna, let go, let go."
07:04;07:06;"So Jake, you left the party early."
07:06;07:09;"Were you aware that the Rams won on Sunday?"
07:09;07:13;"I heard, uh, fireworks in the neighborhood."
07:13;07:17;"And I heard people cheering in the neighboring houses."
07:17;07:20;"And I deduced, I deduced Rams won."
07:20;07:24;"You had a flicker of a thought, I guess the Rams won."
07:24;07:27;"Then you went back to whatever you were doing."
07:27;07:29;"On to the next."
07:29;07:31;"I think I was making a salad at the time."
07:31;07:33;"What kind of salad, Cobb salad?"
07:33;07:34;"No."
07:34;07:38;"When you make a salad, do you get the sort of pre-packaged greens?"
07:38;07:39;"Or do you--"
07:39;07:41;"It was like a spinach salad."
07:41;07:43;"You know, like in one of those like plastic bins."
07:43;07:44;"What do you mean?"
07:44;07:45;"Exactly."
07:45;07:47;"You're not getting like fresh produce."
07:47;07:48;"Wait, but hold on."
07:48;07:49;"Yeah, let's paint this picture."
07:49;07:51;"So Jake, you're there in the kitchen."
07:51;07:52;"Wait, that's not fresh?"
07:52;07:53;"What do you mean?"
07:53;07:54;"I mean, it's gonna go bad."
07:54;07:56;"No, it's fresh, but you can go to the produce."
07:56;07:59;"You don't have to buy the greens in those pre-packaged sort of plastic things."
07:59;08:03;"Yeah, you can get and put, just put them in like a handful and put them in a plastic bag."
08:03;08:04;"Yeah."
08:04;08:05;"But then it gets all soggy."
08:05;08:10;"I prefer, maybe it's not as environmentally friendly, but I prefer the little plastic bin."
08:10;08:12;"I think it stores the spinach better."
08:12;08:13;"I agree."
08:13;08:14;"I'm not critical."
08:14;08:15;"I do the same."
08:15;08:18;"I was just, as Ezra said, painting a picture."
08:18;08:19;"Okay."
08:19;08:24;"So you're there, you got big plastic tub of spinach greens making a salad."
08:24;08:26;"Like, yeah, I come back from your party."
08:26;08:28;"I just like, I just ate a bunch of pizza and wings."
08:28;08:29;"Yep."
08:29;08:30;"But Hannah hadn't had dinner."
08:30;08:32;"I was like, I'm gonna make like a little salad."
08:32;08:33;"We can just have that."
08:33;08:34;"How's that sound?"
08:34;08:35;"She said, that sounds great."
08:35;08:37;"When you got home, there's still, it's like the last quarter."
08:37;08:38;"Did you turn on the game?"
08:38;08:39;"No."
08:39;08:42;"So you came home, you're making a salad."
08:42;08:46;"You're cutting up the bacon, chopping up the hard boiled eggs."
08:46;08:49;"And then you hear these fireworks and you hear cheering."
08:49;08:51;"Do you like pause for a second?"
08:51;08:54;"There's a little smile across your face and you say, congratulations."
08:54;08:57;"Or you like roll your eyes and you're like, keep it down."
08:57;08:58;"Yeah."
08:58;09:02;"I opened the fridge and I was rummaging around trying to find the parm."
09:02;09:04;"So I could grate a little parm on there."
09:04;09:05;"Yeah."
09:05;09:06;"I just, I could care less."
09:06;09:08;"I felt nothing."
09:08;09:10;"I mean, this is, this is great radio folks."
09:10;09:14;"I made a salad."
09:14;09:15;"I felt nothing."
09:15;09:17;"I was like, oh, the Rams won."
09:17;09:20;"This will be when I said, Hannah, I think the Rams won."
09:20;09:22;"She's like, oh yeah, you're probably right."
09:22;09:24;"And then she like checked the internet and she's like, yeah, you're right."
09:24;09:27;"Jake, based on what I'm seeing on the internet, I think you're spot on."
09:27;09:30;"I'm getting the impression that the Rams won the super bowl."
09:30;09:33;"We'll know for sure tomorrow, but I'm calling it."
09:33;09:37;"Let's do another 10 minutes on this moment of me making a spinach salad"
09:37;09:39;"with the Rams winning."
09:39;09:40;"This is good stuff."
09:40;09:42;"I think it's a beautiful picture."
09:42;09:46;"That could be a, when you do like a really depressing mountain bruise album,"
09:46;09:49;"like the joy division mountain bruise, I was making a salad."
09:49;09:50;"The Rams won."
09:50;09:51;"I felt nothing."
09:51;09:54;"But that could be kind of like a silver juice type song."
09:54;09:58;"A hundred percent, especially with the fireworks going off in the background."
09:58;10:02;"Great in the parm as the fireworks went off."
10:02;10:03;"I felt nothing."
10:03;10:04;"Don't give a."
10:04;10:07;"Rams run."
10:07;10:08;"I felt."
10:08;10:09;"Did you feel anything?"
10:09;10:14;"I felt like it was a win-win because I know a lot of great people from LA"
10:14;10:17;"and I've always weirdly like the Cincinnati Bengals."
10:17;10:24;"I have this very strange memory of being at a venue in Cincinnati on tour,"
10:24;10:29;"kind of like a cool DIY punky art space venue,"
10:29;10:31;"which I think we might've played out with dirty projectors."
10:31;10:33;"I've been there twice."
10:33;10:35;"I think we slept there."
10:35;10:36;"Seinfeld."
10:36;10:40;"Can you just give me a number crunch on a punky DIY Cincinnati art space"
10:40;10:42;"venue places?"
10:42;10:45;"You could Google dirty projector Cincinnati 2005."
10:45;10:46;"Yep."
10:46;10:49;"So in 2005, I played there with Jake and dirty projectors."
10:49;10:53;"And I remember we were just like super roughing it, played the show."
10:53;10:56;"The like 20 people left bust out the sleeping bag,"
10:56;11:00;"sleep on the floor in this funky space."
11:00;11:06;"And then two years later I came back and this time we were on a tour with a"
11:06;11:11;"vampire weekend, yacht and dirty projectors, vampire weekend, first to three."
11:11;11:15;"We were the warmup act and we were back at the same venue."
11:15;11:18;"And I have this weird memory of like sitting around with the members of the"
11:18;11:21;"various bands, maybe cause it was an art space."
11:21;11:26;"There was some paper pencils out and we started drawing Cincinnati Bengals"
11:26;11:30;"related kind of like cartoons."
11:30;11:32;"At least me and CT were, I don't know how this started,"
11:32;11:34;"but there was some talk about the Bengals."
11:34;11:39;"And I remember I drew a picture of Carson Palmer and it was, I don't know."
11:39;11:42;"It was like, we were doing some like fun, like nursery school type thing,"
11:42;11:45;"just sitting around drawing Cincinnati Bengals types things."
11:45;11:47;"I don't know where it went, but anyway,"
11:47;11:50;"I always had this like warm feeling about the Cincinnati Bengals."
11:50;11:52;"And I always thought Cincinnati was a cool town."
11:52;11:54;"So I thought you find out what that venue is called."
11:54;12:00;"Yeah, it was publico gallery and it was actually 2007."
12:00;12:02;"It was August 29th, 2007."
12:02;12:06;"That was when vampire weekend came, but Jake's talking about an earlier show."
12:06;12:08;"That was just a dirty project."
12:08;12:12;"Oh, my bad. You know what? Concertarchives.org doesn't go back that far."
12:12;12:14;"I'll keep digging."
12:14;12:16;"No need to dig. We got it. Publico."
12:16;12:17;"Same venue?"
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:19;"Yeah. Same venue."
12:19;12:20;"Okay, I'm closing this number crunch then."
12:20;12:21;"I'm closing the crunch."
12:21;12:22;"Okay."
12:28;12:56;"I will trust that I'll stop and the world revolves. I will jet spirals around the leaves as they fall, around the leaves as they fall."
13:07;13:32;"I'll turn faster than they in their season. I'll turn faster, I'll turn faster. In revolving it changes and I don't trust the axis or the allies."
13:32;13:36;"Yeah, it would have been cool for Cincinnati, you know, for the city of Cincinnati to win."
13:36;13:49;"Cincinnati is a great town. And also, you know what I remembered? Somehow I totally forgot this. I remembered it the day of the game. Is that Vampire Weekend has the key to Cincinnati. So I've got a lot of connections to Cincinnati."
13:49;13:50;"Do tell."
13:50;14:08;"Basically, as I recall, the last time we played Cincinnati, it was a cool kind of semi open air amphitheater, which I remember was sponsored by Skyline Chili, the beloved, I'm sure we've talked about Skyline Chili on the program."
14:08;14:10;"We definitely have talked Skyline, yeah."
14:10;14:16;"Because this venue had, what would you call them, like jumbotrons, you know, two big screens on either side."
14:16;14:17;"Sure."
14:17;14:19;"Where they would film the band."
14:19;14:34;"And on the bottom of each screen, it said, like, Chili Vision or something like Skyline Chili. They had a little outpost at the venue and they sponsored the screens. So the screens were called like Skyline Vision or Chili Vision."
14:34;14:49;"And I remember after the show, I said, our tour manager, please load up the dressing room with lots of Skyline Chili, which is a very unique flavor. It's like kind of sweet. I think it has cinnamon in it. Eat it over spaghetti. Anyway, I remember eating it after the show."
14:49;15:03;"But at that show, at some point before, somebody said to us, hey, guys, the mayor of Cincinnati is going to come to the show and he's going to give you guys the key to the city. And I mean, what do you say in a situation like that? We said, hell yeah, come through."
15:03;15:15;"You think he was a fan or was it word got back to him about the Skyline Chili shout out that you were doing? I guess you were really doing a shout out. You're just more of patronizing a local institution."
15:15;15:36;"He couldn't have known that I had a soft spot for Skyline Chili because they always have a little outpost there. I think we only talked to him for like, you know, 10, 15 minutes and we took a picture and he gave us a little box with the key. And the day of the game, I thought, where the fuck is that key? I think I had it. I started texting the other guys who guys, where the fuck is the key to Cincinnati?"
15:36;15:51;"I thought you had it. I'm like, oh, my God, it's going to kill me if we lost the key to Cincinnati. We might even be in trouble if we did. But yeah, he came through and he gave us the key. And I think it said to Vampire Weekend or something. And he was there with his wife."
15:51;16:14;"Could you imagine if you were in trouble? Yeah, I might not be able to. What is the situation where the mayor's like, guys, we can't get in. Who's got the extra key? Oh, Vampire Weekend. The gate to the city. It's like it's like an ancient Babylon. The gate to the city has been closed for three years."
16:14;16:30;"Maybe at some point they ask for all the keys back and they, you know, maybe it's just kind of like a scam. You come back to Cincinnati and they're just like, all right, so we need that key back. You've had it for five years. And you're like, oh, I lost it. And they're like, hey, no problem. That's a $3,500. It's just a money making scam for the city."
16:30;16:52;"Maybe the mayor's just into music and goes to shows a lot. And he figures like, I'm the mayor. I'm rolling to a show with my wife and some of our best couple friends while I'm there. Why don't I just give a key to the artist? I don't know how many keys this dude's given out. How old was he? You know, he, I feel like, no older than 50s, maybe 40s."
16:52;17:16;"Oh, you know, it's funny. I have this memory too, that I was talking to him and we were just making small talk. And I was like, you know that the screens here are Chili Vision. Skyline Chili sponsors the venue. And he was like, oh yeah, that's a beloved place. But then he said, but my wife, she's from the other Chili family. And then I talked to his wife. She's like, yeah, don't talk to me about Skyline Chili. I'm from the Gold Star Chili family."
17:16;17:44;"I think it was Gold Star. And then as I started talking to them, I realized there's a big Cincinnati Chili rivalry. It's like a Montague's Capulets type thing. And, and she was like, oh, I'm from the other one. I'm from the other Cincinnati Chili dynasty. And I was like, Mrs. Mayor, no disrespect. And she said, none taken. I know you're from, you're an out of town or you didn't know. And I said, yeah, I'm sure your family's Chili is just as good, if not better. And she said, oh, it is. It's much better."
17:44;17:48;"I said, all right, I don't want to weigh in and local, local politics."
17:48;17:52;"You were really skating on thin ice there for a sec."
17:52;18:10;"Yeah. These are the types of situations you can walk into when you're a stranger in a strange land. You think you're making kind of charming small talk and then you say something that really actually offends somebody. But anyway, I remember them being nice and somewhere. I'm going to go do a deep physical dive after the show. I got to find the key to Cincinnati."
18:10;18:34;"But anyway, so, you know, talking about the Super Bowl, imagine you're in my shoes. I got many of the closest people in my life or old school Angelenos. I live here. I feel at home enough. So, I'm not going to be mad if the Rams win. But then at the same time, I got the key to Cincinnati. So, in a sense, I'm going to have a deeper connection to Cincinnati. I felt like, honestly, I felt like it was win-win."
18:34;18:54;"After I watched the halftime show, I kind of felt a little bit like, well, LA got that. They got this halftime show with Dr. Dre and, you know, this LA specific kind of like weird musical version of their culture. So, they got that. Let the Bengals have the win and I think we're even Steven. God had other plans is what it is."

19:08;19:18;"We are turning right to Park Road"
