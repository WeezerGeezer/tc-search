00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis. Guess who's back? On this week's episode we discuss the new Eminem"
00:08;00:16;"album. We also dig into Seinfeld 2000's origin story. All this plus pumping your"
00:16;00:21;"gas in New Jersey, hiking in the Sawtooth Mountains, and the greatest hits"
00:21;00:30;"of 1977 and today. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:14;01:20;"Time Crisis back again. Is the summer over yet? Yeah, Labor Day. But what about"
01:20;01:26;"the solstice? Is it the fall solstice? When does fall start? Like September 20-something. Maybe"
01:26;01:29;"people should talk about it more like that because summer's over but fall"
01:29;01:33;"hasn't started yet. You know what we're in? Indian summer. Wait, what does Indian"
01:33;01:38;"summer refer to? This period of time. The end? In the year. I was gonna say we"
01:38;01:42;"should call it the days between. Wait, what is that a reference to? That was like a"
01:42;01:47;"very late Grateful Dead song. Oh yeah dude. Considered one of the last great"
01:47;01:51;"Garcia-Hunter collaborations. The sentiment in a funny way makes me think"
01:51;01:55;"of the song that you put me on to. That Moody Blues song from the 80s. Their kind"
01:55;02:00;"of comeback song. Oh, Only in Dreams? No, not Only in Dreams. Your Wildest Dreams."
02:00;02:03;"Your Wildest Dreams. And I mean this is very fun but they're both about kind of like"
02:03;02:07;"dudes from the 60s looking back at life a little bit and they have this like"
02:07;02:12;"this is a lighter song but anyway. Sometimes people refer to August 1st to"
02:12;02:17;"August 8th as the days between Jerry's birthday and death day."
02:32;02:39;"Oh this song is dope. Yeah, I remember. I never heard it. You put me on to this. Did I? Yeah."
02:39;03:00;"Anyway, we're in a funny interim period. The summer is gone but it's not quite"
03:00;03:04;"fall yet. Especially if you don't go to school anymore. Right. Because when your"
03:04;03:08;"kid's summer's over you're in school. That's a new thing but you're an adult."
03:08;03:11;"It's like you know in your heart summer's gone but it's not autumn yet either."
03:11;03:17;"Summer just seems like a season of missed opportunities. Yeah. Because when"
03:17;03:20;"you're an adult you're like oh it's summer I got to be doing all this fun"
03:20;03:24;"stuff and then you're like I'm in my life though. Right. Early to mid-September"
03:24;03:29;"strange time. It's a strange transitional moment. Yeah I mean collectively the"
03:29;03:34;"whole society is like okay back to work. Yeah."
03:34;03:52;"All right. I've got a lot on my mind. What's going on? I've got a lot of s*** that I've been"
03:52;03:57;"wanting to talk about. I saw my good buddy Wes Miles the other day. He was in"
03:57;04:02;"town with his band Ra Ra Riot. Mm-hmm. And you know me and Wes have been friends since"
04:02;04:05;"we were four years old. Right. It's always fun to see him because as you know I've"
04:05;04:10;"felt a little bit exiled out here on the west coast. Right. I've been missing the east coast."
04:10;04:13;"I still haven't gotten enough east coast time. But so it's always fun seeing him"
04:13;04:17;"always reminiscent about certain things. And one thing that we started talking"
04:17;04:22;"about which I wasn't even sure if this was the case anymore. Sometimes things"
04:22;04:27;"about childhood seem like weird fever dreams. I couldn't remember if this used"
04:27;04:30;"to be the case was still the case. Whatever. It just seems so funny to me"
04:30;04:35;"having not lived in New Jersey for a long time. But we started talking about"
04:35;04:38;"the fact that in New Jersey you can't pump your own gas. It's like Oregon. And"
04:38;04:41;"Oregon. I think they might be the only two. I think you're right. And even"
04:41;04:45;"Oregon loosened up a little bit. Did they? I started researching because in Oregon"
04:45;04:49;"it's a much bigger state than New Jersey and there's much larger rural stretches."
04:49;04:53;"New Jersey is such a dense state. You're never that far from wherever. But in"
04:53;04:56;"Oregon sometimes people maybe are like driving in a really rural area"
04:56;05:00;"throughout the night and they're like totally **** because the gas station is"
05:00;05:03;"closed. So they loosened up in certain rural areas that you can pump your own"
05:03;05:08;"gas at night. In very rural areas they'll leave the pump on all night so you"
05:08;05:10;"could play with a credit card on your own. Yeah you could do it that way. Right."
05:10;05:13;"I guess for people who don't I mean I don't even drive that much so I guess"
05:13;05:17;"it's not even that much a part of my life. But it's funny like in New Jersey"
05:17;05:21;"it's not that every gas station has attendants. You get in trouble if you try"
05:21;05:24;"to pump your own gas. And then Wes was telling me you know growing up in"
05:24;05:27;"New Jersey of course he's aware that you you're supposed to pull in but you know"
05:27;05:29;"he hadn't been there in a long time. He'd been living in New York and he told the"
05:29;05:33;"story about going to his parents house and pulling in just out of instinct"
05:33;05:35;"getting out of the car and grabbing the handle. And he said like the guy came over"
05:35;05:41;"and like whoa whoa what the ****. I was like oh dude I'm sorry like I forgot."
05:41;05:45;"And he's like what I come to your job just like like really indignant. Wow. I"
05:45;05:49;"was trying to think like I forgot that this is such an unusual thing. This is"
05:49;05:53;"not true in most states. Right. And I guess the whole history of it and then I"
05:53;05:57;"was like is this because the gas attendance lobby is so strong. It's a"
05:57;06:00;"jobs program. It's weird that apparently there's some serious political"
06:00;06:05;"opposition to it. There have been New Jersey state senators who have really"
06:05;06:08;"fought to stop this. It's a bit of a tradition. It all kind of goes back to"
06:08;06:12;"some time when most gas stations used to have attendants in the early days. Sure."
06:12;06:15;"Back when gas was considered and maybe for whatever reason it was more"
06:15;06:20;"dangerous. Oh is that the reason? They wanted professionals doing it. Oh. I think"
06:20;06:24;"at this point the idea that your average Joe who has a driver's license can't"
06:24;06:28;"pump their own gas for is kind of silly to be scared about that. Right. Back in the"
06:28;06:32;"day most places had were attended. It was this new phenomenon. And they'd like put"
06:32;06:35;"air in your tires if you needed to. Yeah. Full service. Yeah. They probably wear like a"
06:35;06:40;"little hat. Then some guy got it in his head a disruptor whenever this was say"
06:40;06:43;"a hundred years ago. There's a disruptor in New Jersey who said you know what"
06:43;06:47;"everybody come to my gas station pump your own gas. Cheaper. And it's cheaper."
06:47;06:50;"And of course people start flocking to this guy. And then all the other gas"
06:50;06:53;"station owners were like we can't let this guy keep growing at this rate so"
06:53;06:56;"like let's make his strategy illegal. And then they pass laws and it's kind of"
06:56;07:00;"whatever. It's been that way ever since. But I guess it still is this like real"
07:00;07:04;"like hot potato in Jersey. It's just like this insane debate. And I just love that"
07:04;07:09;"nobody's like every other state. Yeah. There's 48 other states. And people are not"
07:09;07:13;"dying en masse. Also it's funny to think about if you lived in Jersey like near"
07:13;07:17;"the border it's a small state. So if you just live across the border from like"
07:17;07:20;"Pennsylvania or something or New York. You really need some gas. You just dip"
07:20;07:23;"over to Pennsylvania. You live like four miles from the border. It's just like it's weird."
07:23;07:27;"It's very weird. I lived in Oregon for years. It would be awkward sometimes. You'd"
07:27;07:31;"be like late to work. And you're like I gotta pull in I gotta get some gas. And"
07:31;07:36;"it's like rush hour and they're like slammed. And you're just sitting there. And you don't"
07:36;07:40;"want to be like hey could I get some service here. It's like when you go into a"
07:40;07:42;"restaurant and you're like getting all like impatient with the waiter. It's not a"
07:42;07:46;"good vibe. I wonder if there's like libertarians in New Jersey and Oregon."
07:46;07:50;"And that's like the worst part of their week. Pulling up to the gas station be"
07:50;07:55;"like this is socialism. I could be pumping my own gas. I'm a free man. I got"
07:55;08:00;"to wait for this lazy protected prick to come pump my gas. Now they want to pay"
08:00;08:05;"these kids $15 an hour. Can you buy gas in bulk? Like a lot of canisters of gas"
08:05;08:09;"keep in your garage and have like a lifetime supply of gas. Oh that is legal."
08:09;08:15;"Is it? I'm sure. There you go. That's like a Lonnie's dad situation. For people who don't"
08:15;08:20;"remember what episode of Time Crisis is Lonnie's dad? '54. Really? I don't know."
08:20;08:28;"Lonnie's dad is installing underground tanks. He's spending $94,000 to install"
08:28;08:35;"underground gas tanks. Lonnie's dad is the dad of Jake's childhood friend Lonnie who would hoard"
08:35;08:40;"McRibs during McRib season and then freeze them. They're scarce. For the lean"
08:40;08:47;"months. Winter's coming. When winter would come Lonnie's dad could not go without his"
08:47;08:50;"McRibs so he would buy McRibs on bulk and freeze them so that he could continue to"
08:50;08:54;"eat them. There was a chest freezer in the basement. But anyway you can imagine"
08:54;09:00;"Lonnie's dad just being like I'm so sick of being told by my government that I"
09:00;09:03;"can't pump my own gas. You know what? F*** this. Yeah and just like having like a huge"
09:03;09:09;"very dangerous garage full of gas just so you don't have to go let the guys"
09:09;09:11;"pump it."

10:24;10:26;"- Should we talk about this John Mayer troll?"
10:26;10:28;"- Oh my God. - People may or may not know"
10:28;10:31;"there's a Time Crisis text thread."
10:31;10:33;"It's a great place for us to share ideas,"
10:33;10:37;"compile content for upcoming episodes."
10:37;10:39;"- Yep. - And Seinfeld,"
10:39;10:43;"you who manage our social media and our emails,"
10:43;10:46;"very excitedly that you thought could be from John Mayer."
10:46;10:48;"- I was stoked."
10:48;10:50;"I got this email at eight minute,"
10:50;10:52;"that's numeral eight minute Cape Cod"
10:52;10:55;"from someone purporting to be John Mayer."
10:55;10:58;"And while I don't know John Mayer that well,"
10:58;11:00;"it felt like his voice to me."
11:00;11:01;"And it was early."
11:01;11:03;"My faculties maybe were not all there."
11:03;11:06;"And I sent an excited, earnest screenshot"
11:06;11:08;"to the gang, to the crew, being like,"
11:08;11:12;"""Hey, look, we got John Mayer in the inbox here."""
11:12;11:14;"- The one thing that I'll say,"
11:14;11:16;"when I saw you email this, my gut instinct was like,"
11:16;11:19;"I think of you as a very..."
11:19;11:21;"- Savvy. - Savvy."
11:21;11:22;"- Oh, thanks. - Hard-nosed."
11:22;11:23;"- Yeah. - What does it mean"
11:23;11:24;"to be hard-nosed?"
11:24;11:25;"- What, a little bit stubborn?"
11:25;11:26;"- Tough? - Determined."
11:26;11:27;"- Determined, okay."
11:27;11:28;"- Okay, no, that's not what I mean."
11:28;11:30;"You're like a savvy, street smart."
11:30;11:32;"- Right. - No bull (beep)"
11:32;11:35;"- Skeptical even. - Skeptical kinda guy."
11:35;11:38;"- Well, look, you know, I call it like it is."
11:38;11:40;"You're right, I did grow up in the streets."
11:40;11:44;"And I'm usually able to detect bull (beep)"
11:44;11:47;"and my one blind spot, if I have any,"
11:47;11:50;"is that I want to believe sometimes"
11:50;11:54;"and sometimes that desire will overshadow reality."
11:54;11:56;"And I think that's what happened here."
11:56;11:57;"- I think I see where Ezra was going though,"
11:57;11:59;"because I had the same feeling."
11:59;12:00;"I thought immediately it was BS,"
12:00;12:02;"but I was like, well, Seinfeld's vouching"
12:02;12:04;"and I trust his judgment."
12:04;12:06;"He clearly vetted this."
12:06;12:08;"And so this is God, there's something that I'm not seeing"
12:08;12:10;"'cause I'm an idiot with the internet."
12:10;12:11;"- Fair point, fair point. - And then, okay,"
12:11;12:12;"and then the one thing that I'll say"
12:12;12:14;"that goes in your favor, Seinfeld,"
12:14;12:16;"is that you told us that we got an email"
12:16;12:19;"from somebody who is kind of known to be a troll."
12:19;12:21;"- Who's legitimately funny on Instagram."
12:21;12:23;"- He likes to (beep) around on the internet"
12:23;12:25;"like he knows Brandon Wardell."
12:25;12:28;"- Might I add also that he does follow Seinfeld2000"
12:28;12:31;"on Instagram and will occasionally like a thing."
12:31;12:32;"- Right. - So I'm like,"
12:32;12:33;"he's in our orbit, you know?"
12:33;12:36;"- Right, so that part was something to consider."
12:36;12:39;"This is a dude who probably sits all day long on his phone."
12:39;12:41;"- Yeah. - Tapping away."
12:41;12:43;"- That's all he does. - Looking at memes."
12:43;12:45;"- Just, yeah, that's right."
12:45;12:46;"- He's a meme boy."

13:37;13:41;"- So anyway, you forwarded us this email from John Mayer"
13:41;13:43;"to 8minutecapecot@gmail.com."
13:43;13:46;"Subject line, ""You really hurt me."""
13:46;13:47;"- I mean, I'm hooked, right?"
13:47;13:48;"You get that subject line."
13:48;13:50;"- That is a great start. - Yeah."
13:50;13:53;"- Hey dudes, I've gone on a total binge of your show."
13:53;13:55;"While listening to episode after episode,"
13:55;13:57;"I learned that you don't think I'm good with dead and co."
13:57;13:59;"So I'll work on improving my technique, I guess."
13:59;14:01;"How's my lyricism though, Jake?"
14:01;14:03;"Also, friends are better than signed felt."
14:03;14:05;"Best, John."
14:05;14:08;"- I feel like that's fairly well constructed."
14:08;14:10;"It's not like, I don't know, it's just--"
14:10;14:12;"- It's definitely not impossible."
14:12;14:14;"And you know what's also funny is that"
14:14;14:16;"if anybody really listens to the show,"
14:16;14:19;"knows that Jake, you've grown,"
14:19;14:22;"or you believe that John Mayer has grown as a Jerry fill-in"
14:22;14:23;"and you gave him props."
14:23;14:24;"- I've grown, John's grown."
14:24;14:26;"- Yeah, so--"
14:26;14:27;"- The whole community has grown."
14:27;14:28;"- So the truth is also,"
14:28;14:30;"you could imagine if somebody started Time Crisis"
14:30;14:32;"from the beginning, and it's very time consuming"
14:32;14:35;"to listen to all 150 hours of content."
14:35;14:36;"- Here we are again."
14:36;14:39;"- You could imagine somebody listening"
14:39;14:40;"and being like, wow, Jake doesn't like John Mayer."
14:40;14:42;"And then they don't know."
14:42;14:44;"Spoiler alert, he grows on him."
14:44;14:46;"- The Dodger Stadium show was terrific."
14:46;14:51;"- Can I also add that this came from an AOL account?"
14:51;14:53;"- I know, but why did that make you believe it more?"
14:53;14:54;"- It's a detail."
14:54;14:55;"- 'Cause it's old?"
14:55;14:57;"- It's old, right?"
14:57;14:58;"If there's some history there."
14:58;14:59;"I feel like if you're gonna troll somebody,"
14:59;15:01;"you could just set up a Gmail like that."
15:01;15:02;"This person--"
15:02;15:06;"- Back in the day, one thing that I noticed early on"
15:06;15:08;"when I first entered showbiz,"
15:08;15:13;"I went from hanging out with the college kids and whoever"
15:13;15:15;"to the upper echelons of American society,"
15:15;15:18;"I noticed that celebrities tended to have"
15:18;15:21;"Mac.com email addresses."
15:21;15:22;"Although this is 10 years ago."
15:22;15:23;"- What's the theory on that?"
15:23;15:24;"- I don't even remember."
15:24;15:28;"Maybe back then a Mac.com seemed like a cut above."
15:28;15:29;"- Is that Apple?"
15:29;15:30;"Like Mac?"
15:30;15:31;"- Macintosh."
15:31;15:34;"- I guess it was like the built-in email app"
15:34;15:35;"that would come with a Mac."
15:35;15:37;"And so maybe when you get a new Mac,"
15:37;15:39;"it says, ""Set up your Mac.com,"""
15:39;15:40;"and then suddenly you're locked in."
15:40;15:41;"I don't know."
15:41;15:43;"- Well, I mean, I think there even was a moment"
15:43;15:46;"when being really into Apple products"
15:46;15:49;"was this kind of specific thing."
15:49;15:52;"Maybe almost like before the iPhone dropped."
15:52;15:54;"- Sort of like Justin Long."
15:54;15:54;"- Yeah."
15:54;15:55;"- I'm a Mac."
15:55;15:58;"- The iPhone really won a lot of people over to Apple."
15:58;16:00;"And before that, it was a little bit of like--"
16:00;16:01;"- More niche."
16:01;16:02;"- It was a little more niche."
16:02;16:06;"- The Mac.com was apparently the precursor to iCloud,"
16:06;16:08;"and you had to pay yearly for it."
16:08;16:09;"- Oh, so there you go."
16:09;16:10;"You had to pay."
16:10;16:12;"So, you know, Johnny Sixpack,"
16:12;16:14;"he's not gonna be shelling out for a fancy Mac.com,"
16:14;16:16;"but John Mayer, maybe."
16:16;16:17;"- Joe the Plumber."
16:17;16:18;"- Joe the Plumber, he's not--"
16:18;16:18;"- He's not shelling out."
16:18;16:19;"- He's not shelling out."
16:19;16:20;"- Remember Joe the Plumber?"
16:20;16:21;"- Oh, God."
16:21;16:22;"(laughing)"
16:22;16:24;"- Such a weak vibe."
16:24;16:26;"(laughing)"
16:26;16:27;"- Didn't he run for office at one point?"
16:27;16:29;"- Fuck you, Joe the Plumber."
16:29;16:31;"- Joe did vote for Hillary, though."
16:31;16:32;"- Oh, really?"
16:32;16:33;"- No, I'm just joking."
16:33;16:34;"I'm sure he did."
16:34;16:36;"- It was like Joe the Plumber, Obama girl."
16:36;16:37;"- Oh, wow."
16:37;16:38;"- Anyway."
16:38;16:39;"- Okay, you know what?"
16:39;16:41;"I also wanna go through what was said on the text thread."
16:41;16:43;"- Okay."
16:43;16:45;"- Seinfeld sends a screenshot, ""Oh my God, you guys,"""
16:45;16:48;"and then he sends the ""You really hurt me"" email"
16:48;16:51;"from John Mayer, and wrote, ""I wonder if it's legit."""
16:51;16:54;"- Okay, so there was a bit of skepticism already."
16:54;16:56;"- I wrote back first, ""LOL, no way."""
16:56;16:58;"(laughing)"
16:58;17:02;"- I wrote, ""What's the email address?"""
17:02;17:04;"Then Nick writes back, he saw it,"
17:04;17:05;"(beeping)"
17:05;17:09;"at AOL.com, and I wrote, ""Hmm, doubtful."""
17:09;17:11;"Then Nick wrote, ""The AOL almost feels legit."""
17:11;17:13;"- Yeah. - ""I'm gonna check too."""
17:13;17:14;"And then Seinfeld said, ""I agree."
17:14;17:17;"""Seems kinda like his sense of humor."""
17:17;17:18;"- Could be an ironic AOL."
17:18;17:20;"Thank you, I'm glad we're resurfacing this."
17:20;17:22;"- Matt says, ""It seems bizarre that he would email,"
17:22;17:25;"""but it would be so weird that someone would do that, ha ha."""
17:25;17:26;"Then Jake wrote, ""This is insane."
17:26;17:27;"""I hope it's real."
17:27;17:28;"""It seems like his humor."
17:28;17:30;"""Like Jason said, how do we verify?"""
17:30;17:32;"So you were kinda, you were getting swept up"
17:32;17:34;"in the John Mayer fever."
17:34;17:36;"- Oh, absolutely. - 'Cause you wanna believe,"
17:36;17:37;"right? - Right."
17:37;17:39;"- You want it to be true. - How do we verify?"
17:39;17:41;"But then I think Matt-- - X-Files 2000."
17:41;17:42;"- I think-- - I wanna believe."
17:42;17:46;"- I think Matt, who's one of the producers in the show,"
17:46;17:49;"oh no, this is later, I'm sorry, I'm jumping ahead."
17:49;17:51;"I'm jumping ahead to the elevator selfie."
17:51;17:54;"- Oh, wow, yeah, I forgot about that."
17:54;17:56;"- 'Cause you wrote him back to say, ""Please verify,"""
17:56;18:00;"and then he sent you a photo of John Mayer in an elevator."
18:00;18:02;"Like he had taken a selfie in a mirror of an elevator."
18:02;18:04;"- Yeah. - And then Matt wrote,"
18:04;18:07;"""I just Google image searched John Mayer elevator selfie."""
18:07;18:08;"It was the first thing that popped up."
18:08;18:10;"And I was like, ""Come on, Seinfeld!"""
18:10;18:10;"- I know. - Yeah."
18:10;18:13;"- Well, again, this whole thing was characterized"
18:13;18:15;"by my just wanting it to be so true."
18:15;18:18;"- It's a new side I'm seeing of you."
18:18;18:19;"- Well, you know, I have my,"
18:19;18:20;"it's like frosted mini-wheats, you know?"
18:20;18:22;"There's like the-- - Mm-hmm."
18:22;18:24;"- The earnest side, and then there's the frosted."
18:24;18:25;"- I mean, I don't, I like it."
18:25;18:27;"It's a softer side. - Oh."
18:27;18:29;"- It's the more Canadian side."
18:29;18:31;"- Yeah, I guess so."
18:31;18:32;"- Well, you're a Canadian guy."
18:32;18:35;"You grew up in the comfort of a loving society"
18:35;18:37;"with a little bit more of a social safety net."
18:37;18:39;"- True. - And whatever"
18:39;18:41;"you might have wanted to believe"
18:41;18:44;"back there in Montreal/Toronto"
18:44;18:45;"about how people treat each other,"
18:45;18:49;"about how Tim Horton's functions, whatever,"
18:49;18:52;"by the time you came to LA, is ""Welcome to the Jungle."""
18:52;18:55;"- It's true, and I'm still acclimatizing."
18:55;18:57;"And, you know, I have to say, too,"
18:57;19:00;"that inbox is full of beautiful letters"
19:00;19:02;"from fans all over the world"
19:02;19:04;"who are writing from their heart,"
19:04;19:07;"and it's very rare to get this kind of--"
19:07;19:08;"- Right. - Troll wave kind of thing."
19:08;19:12;"So already, you know, I felt like I'm in a safe space here."
19:12;19:14;"I'm in a no-lie zone. - That's a fair point."
19:14;19:17;"That's a really fair point. - I could also imagine, too,"
19:17;19:21;"that Seinfeld, and we've talked about this before,"
19:21;19:24;"running a meme account, lest we forget"
19:24;19:28;"that Seinfeld 2000 comes from such a kind of dark place"
19:28;19:29;"that it's not just a meme account"
19:29;19:31;"having fun with the show Seinfeld."
19:31;19:35;"It started out to mercilessly mock"
19:35;19:38;"another Seinfeld account. - That's correct."
19:38;19:39;"- Oh, that's the backstory?"
19:39;19:40;"- Oh, yeah. - We never talked about this?"
19:40;19:42;"- No, I don't know this. - Oh, my God."
19:42;19:44;"- I'll tell my version, you tell me if I'm being fair."
19:44;19:47;"- Sure. - There was a few guys"
19:47;19:50;"who I think were comedy, LA kind of comedy writers,"
19:50;19:51;"maybe like sitcom writer type dudes."
19:51;19:53;"- They worked at BuzzFeed at the time."
19:53;19:54;"- Oh, they worked at BuzzFeed."
19:54;19:58;"This was a very simple Twitter."
19:58;20:00;"This is also when Twitter seemed like a pleasant place"
20:00;20:03;"to exchange ideas and try out funny ideas."
20:03;20:04;"- Pretty innocuous. - Pretty innocuous."
20:04;20:08;"So these guys start an account called Modern Seinfeld, right?"
20:08;20:10;"Or Seinfeld Today? - I think it was @SeinfeldToday,"
20:10;20:13;"and then the Modern Seinfeld was like the nickname."
20:13;20:15;"- Okay, so it's @SeinfeldToday."
20:15;20:18;"And this is based on a very simple premise, which is..."
20:18;20:19;"(laughs)"
20:19;20:20;"I can't even say it without thinking"
20:20;20:23;"about your psychotic mockery."
20:23;20:25;"It was based on a very simple premise,"
20:25;20:29;"which is what would Seinfeld be like if it was on TV today?"
20:29;20:32;"I actually love the backstory of this so much"
20:32;20:35;"'cause it's just such a modern internet kind of story."
20:35;20:37;"I almost wanna look up some real examples"
20:37;20:39;"of their early tweets."
20:39;20:41;"- I mean, some of them are pretty good."
20:41;20:42;"- Are they? - Eh."
20:42;20:47;"- I mean, call me crazy, but I feel like that's a big thread"
20:47;20:50;"in the Seinfeld 2000 account."
20:50;20:51;"- Oh, for sure, yeah."
20:51;20:54;"- I'm failing to understand the distinction here."

21:53;21:55;"maybe this episode is gonna be called"
21:55;21:56;"Seinfeld's origin story."
21:56;22:03;"So I'm going back to some random website from 2014."
22:03;22:05;"- Is the account still going?"
22:05;22:06;"- It's not."
22:06;22:09;"And I wanna take some credit for it not going."
22:09;22:12;"This is the 25 best modern Seinfeld tweets."
22:12;22:13;"Somebody took the time in 2014"
22:13;22:16;"to compile some of their favorite modern Seinfeld tweets."
22:16;22:18;"Here's some examples."
22:18;22:20;"Elaine loves the way her new boyfriend smells,"
22:20;22:22;"but when she discovers he uses Axe body spray,"
22:22;22:25;"she begins to question her entire life."
22:25;22:29;"Okay, I can see if you're a real Seinfeld fan,"
22:29;22:31;"you're like, that's lazy."
22:31;22:33;"No, Jerry and Larry wouldn't write that today."
22:33;22:35;"She begins to question her entire life."
22:35;22:38;"I guess, you know, Elaine does have moments like that."
22:38;22:39;"Here's another one."
22:39;22:41;"Jerry's Twitter's hacked."
22:41;22:43;"People like hacked Jerry better."
22:43;22:46;"George tries to get trampled on Black Friday so he can sue."
22:46;22:47;"Everyone is polite."
22:47;22:49;"Okay, here's one issue that people,"
22:49;22:51;"the critics had with this account."
22:51;22:53;"Often it just wasn't that funny,"
22:53;22:55;"and sometimes they would come up with things"
22:55;22:57;"that could have happened back then."
22:57;22:59;"Like the, you know, people going crazy on Black Friday,"
22:59;23:01;"it's, you know, it's probably gotten worse."
23:01;23:03;"That existed in the 90s."
23:03;23:04;"Here's another one."
23:04;23:07;"Kramer fries a turkey in Jerry's apartment."
23:07;23:08;"Jerry, dude in your apartment."
23:08;23:10;"Kramer, nah, Jerry, my apartment's no good."
23:10;23:12;"Too smoky from the dry run."
23:12;23:13;"Yeah, I mean, that's not modern at all."
23:13;23:15;"Was fried turkey like some dumb,"
23:15;23:18;"brief meme in 2013 or something?"
23:18;23:19;"That probably came out around Thanksgiving."
23:19;23:22;"I'm assuming they wanted to hit that holiday,"
23:22;23:24;"get those holiday retweets."
23:24;23:27;"Okay, so you see this account."
23:27;23:27;"Yeah."
23:27;23:28;"What year are we talking?"
23:28;23:30;"2012, actually."
23:30;23:30;"Okay."
23:30;23:32;"End of 2012, December-ish."
23:32;23:34;"And this account was a phenomenon."
23:34;23:37;"You see, it has 820,000 Twitter followers,"
23:37;23:40;"and I think it accumulated that amount in about a month."
23:40;23:41;"And also, you gotta keep in mind, Jake,"
23:41;23:45;"this is in 2013, 2014, where suddenly people were,"
23:45;23:48;"you know, we're starting to hit that 20 plus years"
23:48;23:49;"since the birth of Seinfeld,"
23:49;23:51;"where of course Seinfeld's always been on TV,"
23:51;23:53;"but 2013, I think, was around the time"
23:53;23:54;"people started to be like,"
23:54;23:56;"yeah, but remember Seinfeld?"
23:56;23:57;"Sure."
23:57;23:58;"Oh, wow."
23:58;23:58;"What's up?"
23:58;24:01;"Oh, Jake Longstreth is following this account."
24:01;24:02;"What?"
24:02;24:03;"And you totally forgot about it?"
24:03;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:06;"You just got caught up in the hype."
24:06;24:07;"I don't know."
24:07;24:09;"I mean, if they don't post anymore,"
24:09;24:11;"why would I even know that I follow them?"
24:11;24:12;"Yeah, you probably,"
24:12;24:14;"I mean, they haven't been running for about three years."
24:14;24:15;"I'm a real loose, I'm very indiscriminate"
24:15;24:17;"with who I follow."
24:17;24:17;"You follow them?"
24:17;24:20;"Look, I was following them for a while, too."
24:20;24:21;"It was a phenomenon."
24:21;24:23;"It was like everyone was following this."
24:23;24:24;"You know what's also kind of brutal about it?"
24:24;24:25;"Here's another."
24:25;24:28;"Jerry gets stuck on a never-ending group text."
24:28;24:30;"You used to be able to avoid people."
24:30;24:32;"Now they can choose to live in your pocket forever."
24:32;24:33;"Yeah, it's not--"
24:33;24:34;"One issue about it is--"
24:34;24:36;"The ideas aren't terrible."
24:36;24:37;"No, they're not terrible."
24:37;24:38;"Clearly, the people who run this account are smart."
24:38;24:40;"I also want to make that clear."
24:40;24:42;"They're smart, and there are funny moments,"
24:42;24:45;"and I'm sure they're funny with other stuff."
24:45;24:48;"There's something inherently goofy about the premise,"
24:48;24:49;"and the truth is,"
24:49;24:52;"I bet if you saw Jerry go do stand-up today,"
24:52;24:54;"there might be a few groaners."
24:54;24:56;"I'm sure he'd be doing like cell phone humor."
24:56;24:58;"He does Uber jokes now,"
24:58;24:59;"and yeah, he does iPhone stuff."
24:59;25:01;"What strikes me is the ideas aren't terrible,"
25:01;25:04;"but the way they're written for Twitter,"
25:04;25:08;"it's not a good match between the ideas and the medium."
25:08;25:10;"They're sort of like explaining a joke"
25:10;25:12;"rather than just writing a joke."
25:12;25:14;"Yeah, these are kind of log lines."
25:14;25:17;"Or it's sort of like a dry erase board in a writer's room,"
25:17;25:18;"and they're just writing down ideas,"
25:18;25:19;"and they haven't figured out how to--"
25:19;25:21;"And actually, the truth is, also to be fair to them,"
25:21;25:22;"yeah, you're right about the format,"
25:22;25:23;"'cause I bet if you went back"
25:23;25:26;"to the Seinfeld writer's room in '93,"
25:26;25:29;"and they were just like, you just saw what they wrote."
25:29;25:30;"Yeah, bullet points of--"
25:30;25:32;"Kramer gets a crazy idea"
25:32;25:34;"that he can return bottles in Michigan."
25:34;25:37;"Jerry thinks a girl's hands look funny."
25:37;25:38;"He kind of sucks."
25:38;25:39;"Yeah, yeah."
25:39;25:40;"I think a lot of those original ideas"
25:40;25:44;"came from real, like a lot of them were from Larry's life,"
25:44;25:46;"or all the writers' lives,"
25:46;25:48;"and they had a weird kind of authenticity,"
25:48;25:50;"as absurd as they were."
25:50;25:51;"They also were a little more,"
25:51;25:54;"they had that New York Larry and Jerry flavor,"
25:54;25:57;"whereas these people are just trying to do more gloat."
25:57;25:59;"Jerry discovers his girlfriend"
25:59;26:02;"still uses her J-Date profile, okay?"
26:02;26:05;"Kramer leaves messages for the NSA in his emails."
26:05;26:07;"Newman reluctantly tries SoulCycle."
26:07;26:09;"(laughing)"
26:09;26:11;"What is, yeah, what?"
26:11;26:12;"Okay, so let's cycle back."
26:12;26:14;"Where's the, let's cycle back."
26:14;26:16;"I wanna hear the origin story of Seinfeld 2000."
26:16;26:18;"So you gotta understand, Jake,"
26:18;26:20;"modern Seinfeld, Seinfeld today was poppin'."
26:20;26:21;"I get it."
26:21;26:22;"And it was getting a lot of positive attention."
26:22;26:23;"I followed them."
26:23;26:24;"Clearly, you followed them."
26:24;26:25;"I don't even remember."
26:25;26:27;"You were just on a following spree,"
26:27;26:28;"you were probably following them."
26:28;26:30;"Ashton Kutcher, just laughing your ass off"
26:30;26:31;"on your iPhone 2."
26:31;26:32;"Ashton Kutcher."
26:32;26:33;"(laughing)"
26:33;26:35;"I think I joined Twitter in 2013,"
26:35;26:37;"and I was like, oh yeah, I'll follow this."
26:37;26:38;"I didn't know."
26:38;26:40;"So anyway, this website was poppin'."
26:40;26:41;"Yeah, yeah."
26:41;26:43;"And I also, you know, it's always exciting"
26:43;26:45;"to have a memory that you were early on something."
26:45;26:46;"Just like I've talked about on this show,"
26:46;26:49;"I believe that I was one of the first 5,000 people"
26:49;26:50;"to use Facebook."
26:50;26:52;"And I also believe I was one of the first 5,000 people"
26:52;26:54;"to follow Seinfeld 2000."
26:54;26:58;"Yeah, you were an early adopter for sure."
26:58;27:00;"And so when I first saw it,"
27:00;27:01;"at this point it's hard to even remember,"
27:01;27:03;"'cause it's memes on memes on memes,"
27:03;27:08;"but early Seinfeld 2000 was this totally unhinged voice,"
27:08;27:11;"getting all the characters' names wrong,"
27:11;27:14;"like always writing Jerry and Cram."
27:14;27:16;"You still do, I feel like."
27:16;27:18;"A little bit, but you know."
27:18;27:19;"Jerry with one R."
27:19;27:22;"It's kinda polished, now it's kinda congealed into a, yeah."
27:22;27:26;"It kinda gave this impression that it was like"
27:26;27:29;"a psychotic person who had looked at Seinfeld today"
27:29;27:31;"and was either mercilessly mocking it"
27:31;27:34;"or just crazily trying to recreate it."
27:34;27:38;"So his whole thing was almost in this like crude fashion,"

27:54;27:56;"Yeah, 'cause I remember reading their bio"

27:57;27:59;"""Oh, what if it was still on the air?"""
27:59;28:01;"And I just remember that phrase,"
28:01;28:04;"like by this point I was so burnt out on their account"
28:04;28:06;"and I just saw that phrase, ""on the air,"""
28:06;28:09;"and it felt so like antiquated and I don't know,"
28:09;28:12;"like people are not just watching TV anymore"
28:12;28:15;"and so opening every tweet with like,"
28:15;28:17;"""What if it was on television still?"""

28:55;28:57;"Is that a good summary?"
28:57;28:59;"- Oh, yeah, I mean, I wanna say that is actually"
28:59;29:02;"one of the most accurate descriptions of the account."
29:02;29:04;"I think you're really nailing it."
29:04;29:06;"I mean, I was into it at first"
29:06;29:09;"and then it just started to feel so like smug to me"
29:09;29:14;"and I think the idea of two, you know, media guys"
29:14;29:16;"taking up the mantle of the greatest show on television"
29:16;29:20;"and being like, ""No, we'll just pick up where this left off."""
29:20;29:21;"It just bothered me so much."
29:21;29:25;"- Oh, wait, Nick's showing me an article about,"
29:25;29:28;"that has an article from torontolife.com"
29:28;29:31;"that's talking about Seinfeld 2000."
29:31;29:34;"They talk about your syntax, like imagined."
29:34;29:35;"That was also very, even just the word,"
29:35;29:37;"he would always write, instead of imagine,"
29:37;29:41;"he would write imagine, I-M-A-G-E-N."
29:41;29:43;"Oh, and also you would often like,"
29:43;29:45;"you'd also get into some of the more uncomfortable parts"
29:45;29:49;"of the Seinfeld universe, such as the fact that in real life,"
29:49;29:52;"Michael Richards went on his infamous racist tirade"
29:52;29:53;"- Sure."
29:53;29:54;"- Against some black members of the audience"
29:54;29:58;"at the laugh factory or whatever."
29:58;29:59;"Everybody remembers that he went nuts."
29:59;30:00;"He was saying the N-word, horrible."
30:00;30:04;"So you would always write, ""Crime,"" says the N-word."
30:04;30:05;"So you would always kind of bring in"
30:05;30:08;"that uncomfortable real (beep) into it."
30:08;30:11;"- Yeah, this is a character who doesn't really,"
30:11;30:13;"there's no line of division between the show"
30:13;30:15;"and the actors outside of the show."
30:15;30:16;"It's kind of, it's a lot,"
30:16;30:18;"there's a derangement there happening."
30:18;30:21;"- Has the character evolved or is it?"
30:21;30:22;"- Well, I just want to give you some context"
30:22;30:23;"for his early tweets."
30:23;30:24;"- Okay."
30:24;30:27;"- 'Cause we gave some of the early Seinfeld Today tweets"
30:27;30:28;"from 2013."
30:28;30:31;"These are some of your tweets from 2013."
30:31;30:32;"Again, keep in mind, ""Modern Seinfeld"
30:32;30:35;"is Newman reluctantly tries soul cycle."""
30:35;30:36;"And this is Seinfeld 2000."

30:40;30:42;"Jerry, what's the deal?"
30:42;30:44;"Dot, dot, dot, with me."
30:44;30:47;"He searches sad eyes for an answer, but find none."""
30:47;30:49;"That's an early one."
30:49;30:50;"And then just like this kind of (beep)"
30:50;30:51;"""Picture anything."
30:51;30:54;"K, now imagine that thing in a different context."
30:54;30:56;"LOL."""
30:56;30:57;"Just that kind of like early,"
30:57;30:59;"just like everything is bull (beep)"
30:59;31:01;"That's also funny too, 'cause I think like"
31:01;31:05;"that was before even people who like Twitter hated Twitter."
31:05;31:07;"So it was just like this kind of just like very early"
31:07;31:10;"to be like, ""All this (beep) is stupid."""
31:10;31:14;"Oh, you'd always call Obama, Barry O'Bam."
31:14;31:14;"Barry Obama."
31:14;31:16;"Yeah, there was like this weird, like,"
31:16;31:18;"and it's not that funny anymore,"
31:18;31:20;"but at the time there was kind of this like"
31:20;31:23;"far right undercurrent to it all as well,"
31:23;31:25;"where this person had this like,"
31:25;31:27;"was bringing in all this other stuff into it"
31:27;31:30;"and had a, just a distrust of the president."
31:30;31:32;"Barry O'Bam built Festivus Mosque near ground zero."
31:32;31:33;"Right."
31:33;31:34;"Oh my God."
31:34;31:37;"You know, the Obama Festivus Mosque."
31:37;31:38;"That thing is..."
31:38;31:39;"Okay, so that's the..."
31:39;31:39;"Oh man."
31:39;31:41;"That's the early Seinfeld 2000."
31:41;31:43;"Yeah, and then I think as time went on,"
31:43;31:45;"the Seinfeld 2000 account,"
31:45;31:47;"yeah, moved past the unhinged bitterness."
31:47;31:49;"And then you just started doing legitimately funny stuff,"
31:49;31:52;"such as putting the Curb Your Enthusiasm music"
31:52;31:56;"on real life footage and doing a slow zoom."
31:56;31:58;"Well, at a certain point it became,"
31:58;32:02;"how can I take this insane, very difficult"
32:02;32:04;"to sort of parse, high barrier to entry thing,"
32:04;32:08;"and like, how far can I kind of sell it out, I guess?"
32:08;32:11;"Like, how popular can I make this really"
32:11;32:15;"with the sort of messed up tools that I've at my disposal,"
32:15;32:17;"if that makes sense?"
32:17;32:17;"You know, how-"
32:17;32:18;"How fast did it grow?"
32:18;32:20;"How beautiful a painting could I paint"
32:20;32:23;"with this broken paintbrush that I,"
32:23;32:25;"to use an analogy."
32:25;32:27;"Oh, I'm following from the art world."
32:27;32:27;"Thank you, thank you."
32:27;32:30;"A sophisticated art world analogy."
32:30;32:32;"I only use the finest materials, okay?"
32:32;32:33;"I don't use broken-"
32:33;32:34;"I know, I know."
32:34;32:36;"And then you started branching out to doing like-"
32:36;32:38;"You're like the Van Gogh of, no."
32:39;32:40;"You just started branching out."
32:40;32:42;"Well, one of our earliest collaborations"
32:42;32:46;"was Seinfeld hit me up asking if I would do the music"
32:46;32:48;"for his junior video game."
32:48;32:49;"Wow, yeah, that was a trip."
32:49;32:51;"And I just recorded myself, I think, on an iPhone going,"
32:51;32:55;"bum, ba-dum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da."
32:55;32:58;"You know, in some ways, I wonder,"
32:58;32:59;"I just read an article this morning"
32:59;33:03;"about kind of like toxic fan culture."
33:03;33:04;"Uh-huh."
33:04;33:06;"And they were talking, and especially with pop stars,"
33:06;33:10;"this was specifically about gay male fandoms"
33:10;33:12;"and their misogyny, the occasional misogyny,"
33:12;33:17;"towards female pop stars, which is a battle,"
33:17;33:19;"whatever, that I recuse myself from."
33:19;33:20;"I have no opinion on it,"
33:20;33:23;"but the person writing this article was saying that,"
33:23;33:27;"famously, a lot of female pop stars have large gay audiences,"
33:27;33:30;"but sometimes the interaction that at first seems like"
33:30;33:32;"a mutual support system, especially for people"
33:32;33:35;"who could use it because they're oppressed by things"
33:35;33:38;"in society can sometimes turn toxic into a kind of thing"
33:38;33:39;"where people make themselves feel better"
33:39;33:42;"by constantly calling, you know,"
33:42;33:45;"say, Selena Gomez fat or something."
33:45;33:46;"Oh, yeah."
33:46;33:47;"The thing that caught my attention,"
33:47;33:48;"'cause I've always liked her music,"
33:48;33:51;"was that they were talking about a pop star, Marina,"
33:51;33:54;"who had this group, Marina and the Diamonds."
33:54;33:56;"And I remember, she kind of came out around the same time"
33:56;33:58;"as Vampire Weekend, she's from the UK."
33:58;34:01;"They quoted her as she had like this kind of moment"
34:01;34:04;"with a fan where she said the fan basically was just like"
34:04;34:05;"saying something kind of mean to her."
34:05;34:06;"And she's like, ""You know what?"
34:06;34:07;"I don't find that funny."""
34:07;34:10;"And the person's like, ""Oh my God, I'm obsessed with you."
34:10;34:11;"This is just a joke."""
34:11;34:12;"She's like, ""Yeah, well, I don't find it funny."""
34:12;34:14;"- Was this in person or on the internet?"
34:14;34:15;"- This was on Twitter."
34:15;34:16;"She's like, ""I don't find that (beep) funny."
34:16;34:19;"You know, every time I get a little message like this,"
34:19;34:20;"it hurts my feelings."
34:20;34:21;"I struggle with depression."
34:21;34:23;"I'm a regular person."
34:23;34:24;"That's just not funny to me."""
34:24;34:28;"And there is this funny way that I feel like,"
34:28;34:30;"I'll make the case that Seinfeld 2000"
34:30;34:33;"kind of saw some of this coming."
34:33;34:36;"- And the fact that the fandom is for like Seinfeld,"
34:36;34:37;"and it was like kind of so obsessive"
34:37;34:39;"and always right on the border of like,"
34:39;34:41;"does this person like Seinfeld or hate it?"
34:41;34:43;"Like for instance, the constant reference"
34:43;34:45;"to Cram saying the N word,"
34:45;34:46;"constantly reminding people like,"
34:46;34:49;"this dude did something really (beep) up."
34:49;34:51;"And it had like, there was the energy of the account"
34:51;34:55;"almost seemed like a premonition of toxic fandom."
34:55;34:57;"But anyway, then I think you kind of got into just,"
34:57;35:00;"you kind of just found your own voice and it wasn't,"
35:00;35:02;"you didn't need to know what modern Seinfeld was"
35:02;35:04;"to find Seinfeld 2000 funny."

36:25;36:27;"I've always been interested in these times"
36:27;36:30;"when on Twitter or Instagram or something,"
36:30;36:32;"you kind of break character."
36:32;36:34;"Like there were these moments where I've seen"
36:34;36:37;"you post something and somebody might be like,"
36:37;36:39;"this is not your best work, I don't find this one funny."
36:39;36:40;"And I don't know if this is,"
36:40;36:43;"I might be not imagining this incorrectly,"

36:48;36:51;"- I mean, as you said, like there was an anger"
36:51;36:53;"to the account and--"
36:53;36:54;"- And there's an anger to the man."
36:54;36:58;"- There's, oh, a deep, deep seated anger"
36:58;37:00;"that follows me like a dark cloud wherever I go."
37:00;37:01;"- Still nobody knows what you look like."
37:01;37:04;"They know your real name a little bit on the internet."
37:04;37:07;"- You know, if you're good enough at the Google,"
37:07;37:10;"you can probably surface some stuff about me."
37:10;37:12;"But I kind of delivered,"
37:12;37:14;"to maintain the integrity of the account,"
37:14;37:17;"you know, I really didn't put myself out there that much."
37:17;37:19;"And that's why, you know,"
37:19;37:21;"time crisis is such a compromise."
37:21;37:22;"I'm kidding."
37:22;37:25;"- Well, it's no, I mean--"
37:25;37:27;"- I wanna be really clear, I am kidding."
37:27;37:28;"- I'm joking."
37:28;37:30;"- It's the next phase in your evolution."
37:30;37:30;"- That's true."
37:30;37:31;"- But yeah, I was gonna say,"
37:31;37:33;"I mean, we were talking about this whole thing."
37:33;37:37;"We're in a deep Seinfeld 2000 origin story wormhole,"
37:37;37:38;"'cause we were talking about the John Mayer thing,"
37:38;37:41;"but this is all to say that there's always been"
37:41;37:45;"a type of caustic energy associated with your account"
37:45;37:48;"in the humor itself, but also in those moments"
37:48;37:50;"where you don't suffer fools gladly."
37:50;37:51;"- Well, you know--"
37:51;37:54;"- Like part of the reason that I can't go on social media"
37:54;37:57;"that much anymore is that I always see things,"
37:57;37:59;"whether it's directed at me or even just some dumb thing"
37:59;38:01;"that somebody says about politics or something,"
38:01;38:06;"I, similar to George in the infamous jerk store episode,"
38:06;38:09;"I will get in my head thinking about what I should say"
38:09;38:10;"or what I could say."
38:10;38:12;"And I think anybody who's experienced this"
38:12;38:13;"is like somebody says some dumb (beep) to you on Twitter,"
38:13;38:18;"some hypocritical, rude, obnoxious, ignorant (beep)"
38:18;38:21;"and you realize that, what are you gonna do?"
38:21;38:24;"Get in a flame war on social media?"
38:24;38:26;"So, okay, you're smart enough to step away,"
38:26;38:27;"but you still could get stuck in your head,"
38:27;38:28;"wake up in the middle of the night,"
38:28;38:30;"be like, you know what I should've written?"
38:30;38:31;"- Oh, man."
38:31;38:32;"- On some real George Costanza (beep)."
38:32;38:33;"But anyway, that's me."
38:33;38:36;"I tend not to react, but I think about it a lot later,"
38:36;38:39;"whereas you, you'll occasionally tell some people"
38:39;38:40;"to go (beep) themselves."
38:40;38:42;"- And the thing is, I can't take any of this so seriously"
38:42;38:45;"'cause it's such a stupid thing that I'm doing,"
38:45;38:49;"but there's still those minor irritations"
38:49;38:51;"and there's something funny to me about taking like a,"
38:51;38:52;"why'd you gotta say that?"
38:52;38:56;"And just blowing the reaction so far out of proportion."
38:56;38:57;"- I feel like I've seen interactions that you've had"
38:57;39:00;"where somebody says something kind of prickly towards you"
39:00;39:03;"and you go so insane, just like, go (beep)"
39:03;39:05;"and they're just like, yo, chill out, man."
39:05;39:06;"This is just a Seinfeld account."
39:06;39:08;"- Well, yeah, it's compounded by the fact"
39:08;39:11;"that there's a sizable enough audience"
39:11;39:14;"that these people are kind of humiliated in front of large."
39:14;39:15;"It's not that funny, but you know, it's kind of--"
39:15;39:18;"- You're the original Wendy's account."
39:18;39:19;"- Oh my God."
39:19;39:21;"- Oh my God, maybe you're right, yeah."
39:21;39:24;"- Or there's a strain of, I mean, everybody knows,"
39:24;39:27;"there's a strain of Twitter people that I consider,"
39:27;39:29;"I call it comic book guy Twitter,"
39:29;39:31;"the Simpsons character comic book guy."
39:31;39:32;"- Yes, I'm familiar with them."
39:32;39:35;"- I don't know, for some reason, it's not that hostile,"
39:35;39:37;"but it bothers me so much where you like,"
39:37;39:39;"I'll like do a joke that I think is kind of clever"
39:39;39:42;"and someone will be like, you should have phased it like this"
39:42;39:43;"and it's like, why do you care?"
39:43;39:45;"Like, leave me alone, you know?"
39:45;39:49;"Like, oh, let me just go back and delete it"
39:49;39:51;"and reword it for you because you,"
39:51;39:53;"I don't know why it irritates me so much,"
39:53;39:55;"but it's just like, sit back and enjoy the free content."
39:55;39:56;"- I had a thought. - And shut up."
39:56;39:59;"- I don't wanna, you know, I try to be positive on this show"
39:59;40:01;"'cause deep down I do think talking (beep)"
40:01;40:03;"about some art, whether it's a mainstream whatever"
40:03;40:06;"or something small, it doesn't serve that much purpose,"
40:06;40:09;"but I was watching, I'm not gonna say which one,"
40:09;40:12;"but I was watching a comic book movie on my flight back"
40:12;40:15;"from UK where we played a festival the other week"
40:15;40:17;"and there was something about the tone"
40:17;40:19;"of this comic book movie, and maybe it's a lot of them,"
40:19;40:21;"and I've seen stuff in MCU that I love,"
40:21;40:23;"I've seen stuff I don't like as much,"
40:23;40:25;"and I grew up loving comic books, by the way,"
40:25;40:27;"and specifically Marvel comic books."
40:27;40:29;"A lot of my favorite movies are comic book movies,"
40:29;40:31;"but there's something about the tone,"
40:31;40:33;"it almost seems like some of these movies now"
40:33;40:37;"are made for that guy or that person"
40:37;40:39;"where part of me is kinda like,"
40:39;40:41;"I like to see Seinfeld 2000 say go (beep) yourself"
40:41;40:45;"because (beep) that caters too much to the fans"
40:45;40:46;"is not what I want as a fan, you know?"
40:46;40:48;"It's like a bit of a paradox."
40:48;40:50;"So in some of these movies where everything"
40:50;40:53;"is this groaner inside joke,"
40:53;40:56;"and maybe certain fans were starved for a long time."
40:56;40:57;"- See, I always think of them as serving"
40:57;40:59;"the lowest common denominator,"
40:59;41:02;"just like bland, corporate, global audience."
41:02;41:03;"- No, but you know what's funny is that--"
41:03;41:05;"- And you can just go in and you don't have to know--"
41:05;41:06;"- No, they have more flavor--"
41:06;41:07;"- That's why I hate all those movies."
41:07;41:10;"- They have more flavor than some of the really bland"
41:10;41:13;"like '90s action movies, and there's more inside jokes"
41:13;41:14;"and stuff, but it's like when I was watching"
41:14;41:16;"Infinity War on the plane, and I like a lot of elements"
41:16;41:18;"of it, and I like Thor the most"
41:18;41:22;"because he's the character that has a sense of humor."
41:22;41:25;"Thor represents the absurdity of it all."
41:25;41:27;"- Uh-huh, self-aware."
41:27;41:29;"- Well, he's not self-aware, but the fact that his--"
41:29;41:29;"- The movie is."
41:29;41:33;"- The fact that his movies tend to be his movies,"
41:33;41:34;"but he, Thor."
41:34;41:36;"- Thor, the Norse god of thunder."

43:06;43:07;"- I realize that talking about the MCU,"
43:07;43:09;"this is a very hot button topic,"
43:09;43:10;"and I probably should have put more thought--"
43:10;43:11;"- It is?"
43:11;43:12;"- Is it?"
43:12;43:12;"Am I gonna get in trouble for--"
43:12;43:13;"- Hot button?"
43:13;43:14;"- Yeah, I mean it--"
43:14;43:17;"- This is just me as a fan talking."
43:17;43:19;"Just in the movies, I like Thor,"
43:19;43:23;"because Thor is a big doofus,"
43:23;43:26;"and all the jokes about Thor and related to Thor"
43:26;43:31;"are about that he thinks he's this big, strong guy,"
43:31;43:33;"but he's often being foiled by it."
43:33;43:36;"So there's something about the humor surrounding Thor"
43:36;43:39;"that lets a little bit of air out of the comic book thing,"
43:39;43:40;"but in a way that I like,"
43:40;43:43;"whereas some of the other characters, like Iron Man,"
43:43;43:45;"they think they're being self-aware,"
43:45;43:48;"but it's in this just really played out, boring way."
43:48;43:53;"So Thor will get into almost classically funny,"
43:53;43:56;"like slapstick situations."
43:56;43:59;"A big, strong guy and somebody slips on a banana peel."
43:59;44:00;"That doesn't literally happen."
44:00;44:02;"But there's something funny about the way they undercut him."
44:02;44:05;"Whereas Iron Man, it's almost like if you took Die Hard,"
44:05;44:08;"and when you first see Die Hard as a kid,"
44:08;44:11;"and you're like, holy (beep), it's action, but it's funny,"
44:11;44:13;"and he's saying yippee-ki-yay, mother (beep),"
44:13;44:14;"and he's got all these good lines,"
44:14;44:16;"it's almost like, oh, you like that?"
44:16;44:18;"Let's crank it up to 1,000."
44:18;44:19;"And then you're like, God, please stop."
44:19;44:22;"Just like every time Iron Man falls, it's like,"
44:22;44:24;"okay, we're gonna have to have a talk about that."
44:24;44:25;"Hey, can you call my insurance company?"
44:25;44:28;"It's like, it never ends."
44:28;44:29;"There's always these jokes in it"
44:29;44:30;"that are about the characters,"
44:30;44:33;"these funny references to something that's just like,"
44:33;44:35;"you could almost do that Seinfeld 2000,"
44:35;44:37;"just like literally people running together,"
44:37;44:39;"like, hey, it's the guy from Captain America."
44:39;44:41;"Well, you're the guy from Black Panther."
44:41;44:43;"Yeah, and you don't know this part about Black Panther"
44:43;44:45;"'cause you didn't see it."
44:45;44:46;"It's like, the jokes are almost like that."
44:46;44:48;"So it's almost like if you took the concept"
44:48;44:51;"of giving the fans what they want,"
44:51;44:52;"it's almost like be careful what you wish for."
44:52;44:54;"That's what I feel like."
44:54;44:54;"Yeah, yeah."
44:54;44:56;"Am I gonna get in trouble for this?"
44:56;44:58;"With who?"
44:58;44:59;"The MCU."
44:59;45:00;"People really love the MCU."
45:00;45:02;"I love parts of the MCU."
45:02;45:04;"What do you mean, the MCU?"
45:04;45:06;"I guess I just have this feeling,"
45:06;45:08;"it's truly like, be careful what you wish for."
45:08;45:11;"So the issue is that they're pandering?"
45:11;45:12;"Yes, that's part of it."
45:12;45:14;"You stumble upon that formula"
45:14;45:18;"and then you just try to repeat that ad infinitum"
45:18;45:19;"because you know it's gonna make money?"
45:19;45:20;"That's part of it. Is that what you're saying?"
45:20;45:23;"I don't, see, I can't take any of these movies seriously."
45:23;45:24;"I'm probably not explaining it well."
45:24;45:27;"So it's just kinda like, maybe just as I get older,"
45:27;45:30;"you know, I just admire like artists"
45:30;45:32;"and cinematic universes."
45:32;45:34;"They're just really off on their own trip."
45:34;45:38;"The fans go with them rather than them just giving the fans"
45:38;45:40;"like every little thing they could ever want."
45:40;45:41;"Right."
45:41;45:43;"I'm loving the Avengers movies or at least Infinity War."
45:43;45:45;"It's exciting because everybody's coming together"
45:45;45:47;"and it's the culmination of a big story,"
45:47;45:49;"but it really is some be careful what you wish for."
45:49;45:52;"When I imagine me being a kid in the nineties,"
45:52;45:54;"reading Marvel comic books"
45:54;45:56;"and loving the characters and all this (beep)"
45:56;45:58;"and wishing that there were better movies"
45:58;45:59;"that I could watch."
45:59;46:01;"And maybe it's just 'cause I'm an adult now,"
46:01;46:03;"but now I see this (beep) and I'm just like, ooh."
46:03;46:06;"Is there a musical analogy to be drawn?"
46:06;46:07;"I was just thinking."
46:07;46:07;"I definitely can't say that."
46:07;46:08;"Oh, 'cause I was just thinking."
46:08;46:09;"I can't talk about that."
46:09;46:12;"Oh, well I'll say it 'cause I don't care."
46:12;46:13;"I was thinking."
46:13;46:14;"Don't you say it."
46:14;46:15;"Late period Weezer."
46:15;46:16;"Oh."
46:16;46:20;"How Rivers became pathological in his need"
46:20;46:22;"to write a perfect pop song and quote,"
46:22;46:26;"like have hits and like make songs that were."
46:26;46:27;"I would actually, okay, that's interesting."
46:27;46:28;"But I'm just saying like."
46:28;46:29;"I would almost take the counter argument"
46:29;46:32;"because he straight up alienated people by doing that."
46:32;46:35;"The Avengers got bigger than ever by kind of pandering"
46:35;46:36;"and giving people every little thing"
46:36;46:37;"they could possibly want."
46:37;46:40;"Every little funny fan interaction and stuff."
46:40;46:42;"It's kind of like back in the day,"
46:42;46:46;"people would dream about two characters coming together."
46:46;46:47;"And now."
46:47;46:48;"Right."
46:48;46:50;"If everybody wants it to happen, it just will happen."
46:50;46:51;"You know what this makes me think of too?"
46:51;46:55;"It's almost like, remember in the 90s, you'd go see a movie."
46:55;46:56;"I don't know why this is coming to mind,"
46:56;46:59;"but like I remember when I was like eighth grade,"
46:59;47:01;"we saw Congo, Michael Crichton's Congo."
47:01;47:02;"Do you remember that movie?"
47:02;47:03;"Sure, sure."
47:03;47:04;"And I remember we'd go to movies with my friends"
47:04;47:06;"and we'd like enjoy it earnestly,"
47:06;47:08;"but there'd also be a level where you're kind of"
47:08;47:10;"leaning over to your friend and you'd be like,"
47:10;47:12;"""Oh, wouldn't it be funny if this or, you know,"
47:12;47:13;"""oh, what if,"" you know, you're kind of riffing"
47:13;47:14;"on the joke. Yes."
47:14;47:17;"And now it's almost like the two layers have been melded."
47:17;47:19;"So as soon as you're about to turn to your friend,"
47:19;47:22;"Robert Downey Jr. says the joke that you're about to like,"
47:22;47:24;"say to your bro kind of deal."
47:24;47:25;"Right."
47:25;47:26;"So you're just sitting there like."
47:26;47:27;"But isn't that cool though?"
47:27;47:29;"That they're like one step ahead of you?"
47:29;47:30;"But I guess what I'm saying is be careful"
47:30;47:31;"what you wish for."
47:31;47:32;"I don't find it cool."
47:32;47:34;"It makes me want to watch the movie less."
47:34;47:35;"But maybe I'm crazy too."
47:35;47:36;"And also, yeah, I got it."
47:36;47:39;"Look, I'm very scared of the MCU."
47:39;47:41;"I really just do want to say again to the MCU."
47:41;47:43;"Are you talking about the MCU fans or?"
47:43;47:45;"Well, the fans are part of the you."
47:45;47:46;"It's a universe."
47:46;47:50;"So it's fans, it's the actors, it's the heroes themselves."
47:50;47:51;"I admire a lot of things."
47:51;47:53;"It's a powerful cabal."
47:53;47:54;"It's a powerful you."
47:54;47:55;"I just know that, you know."
47:55;47:56;"Very powerful you."
47:56;47:58;"This is very treacherous territory,"
47:58;48:01;"stuff we'd normally stay away from on ""Time Crisis."""
48:01;48:02;"We normally just talk about"
48:02;48:04;"the tasteful palette of '70s music."
48:04;48:05;"This is--"
48:05;48:05;"Let's get back to that."
48:05;48:06;"Yeah, we should get back to that."
48:06;48:09;"But I guess all I'm saying is I agree with Seinfeld"
48:09;48:10;"that it may be just getting older"
48:10;48:13;"that I like boring stuff now."
48:13;48:15;"I long for things that are rough around the edges."
48:15;48:18;"Like when I was a kid, I would try to watch"
48:18;48:21;"like a Neil Young concert DVD."
48:21;48:23;"And he's like making noise for 10 minutes."
48:23;48:24;"I'd just be like, ""Damn it, Neil."
48:24;48:26;"""Just give the people what they want."""
48:26;48:27;"And now you're like, ""Yeah, dude."""
48:27;48:29;"And now I'm just like, ""Honestly,"
48:29;48:32;"""that is a man on his own trip and I respect it."""
48:32;48:35;"I would rather watch Neil Young make distorted,"
48:35;48:39;"weird noises for 15 minutes than watch Iron Man be like,"
48:39;48:42;"""Um, yeah, that's not gonna work for me, Thanos."""
48:42;48:43;"You know?"
48:43;48:43;"We're gonna have to talk about that."
48:43;48:45;"You know, just like--"
48:45;48:47;"Dude, you don't have to convince me of that."
48:47;48:50;"I am fully on board with that."
48:50;48:52;"That concludes my dissertation,"

50:25;50:27;"and the meme world is very nasty,"
50:27;50:30;"people accusing each other of stealing memes,"
50:30;50:32;"people trying to out-meme each other,"
50:32;50:34;"the whole meme economy is dirty."

50:39;50:41;"And maybe every day you go on Twitter,"

50:54;50:55;"of the meme wars."
50:55;50:56;"- It's hell."
50:56;50:58;"- And maybe for you,"
50:58;51:00;"the 8-Minute Cape Cod email address"
51:00;51:04;"is a place where you escape the comic book guys,"
51:04;51:07;"the toxic fandoms, the haters, the losers,"
51:07;51:09;"and suddenly we're getting these sweet emails"
51:09;51:13;"from people who like ""Time Crisis"""
51:13;51:14;"and just talk about their own lives."
51:14;51:16;"'Cause a lot of the best ""Time Crisis"" emails"
51:16;51:17;"aren't even about us."
51:17;51:19;"They're not fan mail, quote-unquote,"
51:19;51:21;"they're part of the TCU."
51:21;51:21;"People who are saying,"
51:21;51:24;"""This is something that I'm interested in, positive stuff."
51:24;51:26;"""Here's something you might wanna check out."""
51:26;51:27;"Versus the constant criticism"
51:27;51:29;"and hatred of the social media platform."
51:29;51:32;"So maybe for you, this was your safe space,"
51:32;51:35;"and here comes an email from John Mayer saying,"
51:35;51:36;"""You really hurt me."""
51:36;51:40;"And suddenly, this hard-boiled New York cop"
51:40;51:41;"finds his heart melting,"
51:41;51:45;"and your bull(beep) radar wasn't functioning as well."
51:45;51:47;"- Yeah, I think that's about it."
51:47;51:50;"- Hopefully this doesn't open up a can of worms,"
51:50;51:52;"or we just get inundated with trolls."
51:52;51:53;"You know what?"
51:53;51:56;"Those listeners considering it,"
51:56;52:00;"you should know that Seinfeld's guard is up now."
52:00;52:01;"- You're right."
52:01;52:03;"- One got through the palace gates, but that's it."
52:03;52:04;"- A lot more vigilant."
52:04;52:08;"I'll also say that this came as part of a wave, by the way,"
52:08;52:11;"of somebody adding us to a Pepsi-Cola mailing list."
52:11;52:12;"- Oh my God."
52:12;52:13;"- And me tweeting about it,"
52:13;52:14;"like, ""Who's the bozo who did this?"""
52:14;52:16;"And then we were suddenly getting,"
52:16;52:19;"""Ed Sheeran, get your free concert tickets."""
52:19;52:21;"Like, ""No, Wendy's,"" all this stuff."
52:21;52:24;"And then I had to unsubscribe one by one."
52:24;52:26;"So yeah, there was a bit of corruption happening."
52:26;52:29;"And then in the middle of it all, fake John Mayer."
52:29;52:31;"- Can I just say my favorite part about that text thread"
52:31;52:36;"is that Seinfeld says, ""I basically need some proof."
52:36;52:37;"""Send me some proof."""
52:37;52:40;"And he gets the email back from John Mayer"
52:40;52:42;"saying, ""Here's a selfie."""
52:42;52:44;"(laughs)"
52:44;52:46;"There was no picture attached."
52:46;52:49;"So he wants to believe so much that he sort of says,"
52:49;52:50;"""You know, I hate to ask,"
52:50;52:52;"""but maybe you forgot the attachment."""
52:52;52:53;"(laughs)"
52:53;52:57;"And so that's when he gets like, ""Oh, sorry."""
52:57;52:58;"- Oh yeah, I did."
52:58;52:59;"- Here's, oh, I did."
52:59;53:01;"- I forgot the attachment 'cause I'm just a regular guy."
53:01;53:02;"I'm a regular guy who makes mistakes."
53:02;53:05;"- He wanted to believe so bad that he even."
53:05;53:07;"- Yeah, this whole time I'm walking the line between,"
53:07;53:09;"look, I don't wanna look like a fool,"
53:09;53:13;"but I also don't wanna offend the John Mayer."
53:13;53:15;"So I'm walking this line here."
53:15;53:18;"I get, you know, I'm keeping the tone light,"
53:18;53:20;"a little bit skeptical, you know."
53:20;53:22;"- We should also say that we would love"
53:22;53:24;"to have the real John Mayer come on the show."
53:24;53:26;"- Yeah, that would be vindicating."
53:26;53:28;"- I don't think it would be that hard."
53:28;53:30;"- Be fun to talk some dead."
53:30;53:31;"- Jake can apologize."
53:31;53:33;"- I will not apologize."
53:33;53:36;"- Let me keep it real with you, John."
53:36;53:38;"- If there was a tactful way to approach it,"
53:38;53:40;"to be like, ""Hey, listen,"
53:40;53:43;"""I saw you at the Hollywood Bowl in '17,"
53:43;53:44;"""then I saw you at Dodger Stadium in '18,"
53:44;53:47;"""and I noticed your playing was a lot different in '18."""
53:47;53:50;"And I would say this, a lot more reminiscent of Jerry,"
53:50;53:52;"how conscious of an effort was that?"
53:52;53:55;"Was that in response to fan feedback?"
53:55;53:56;"I mean, I don't know."
53:56;53:58;"I feel like you could bring that up in a way"
53:58;54:00;"that isn't like saying you suck."
54:00;54:01;"- It's very diplomatic."
54:01;54:02;"- Anywho."
54:02;54:03;"- Let's go for it."
54:05;54:09;"(upbeat music continues)"
55:19;55:22;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
55:22;55:26;"- This is from Andrew Tilby, perhaps Tilbay."
55:26;55:29;"Dear Jake, Ezra and Seinfeld, frankly, I'm disappointed."
55:29;55:32;"Back in March, Jake and Ezra needlessly spent"
55:32;55:34;"a good 20 minutes completely bashing"
55:34;55:36;"the great state of Connecticut."
55:36;55:37;"Sure, this episode is a couple months old,"
55:37;55:40;"but in typical TC fashion, I'm just a little bit behind."
55:40;55:41;"- Respect."
55:41;55:43;"- The most hate came directly from Ezra."
55:43;55:45;"See, I don't remember this."
55:45;55:46;"Scathingly putting Connecticut"
55:46;55:48;"in the bottom five states regarding music."
55:48;55:49;"(laughs)"
55:49;55:51;"Jake, not only do I also hail from CT,"
55:51;55:53;"but I also grew up in Northwestern CT,"
55:53;55:55;"which your Wikipedia suggests where you're from too."
55:55;55:58;"I thought we might share some Connecticut pride,"
55:58;56:00;"especially considering the expansive list of musicians"
56:00;56:04;"who come from our tiny state, but apparently not."
56:04;56:05;"In the episode, the two of you seem to believe"
56:05;56:08;"that the only musician to ever come out of Connecticut"
56:08;56:09;"is John Mayer."
56:09;56:11;"You think Mayer's all we got?"
56:11;56:14;"Mayer's got nothing on some of CT's greats."
56:14;56:16;"And then he lists a lot of Connecticut stuff."
56:16;56:18;"- Well, okay, now first of all,"
56:18;56:22;"my memory is that you were the one, Jake,"
56:22;56:24;"bashing Connecticut because you came from there"
56:24;56:27;"and you have some self-hatred or just, you know,"
56:27;56:28;"you think it represents-- - I don't have self-hatred."
56:28;56:30;"- Represents the bad old days."
56:30;56:31;"- No, it's not that."
56:31;56:35;"My take on Connecticut is that Connecticut"
56:35;56:38;"in the public imagination is misrepresented."
56:38;56:41;"The reputation of the state is that of like--"
56:41;56:42;"- Greenwich."
56:42;56:45;"- Greenwich, Southwest corner, like Greenwich and Stanford,"
56:45;56:46;"which is the Southwest corner. - Preppy."
56:46;56:48;"- Near New York. - Investment bankers."
56:48;56:49;"- Investment bankers, precisely that."
56:49;56:51;"Real estate guys, that kind of stuff."
56:51;56:53;"And my argument was basically that like the state"
56:53;56:58;"is like not dissimilar from New Jersey or Massachusetts"
56:58;57:01;"or suburban New York outside of the city,"
57:01;57:03;"which is to say a mix of like working class,"
57:03;57:06;"rich towns, rural areas."
57:06;57:07;"It's a mishmash."
57:07;57:10;"And so I was just saying that like Connecticut"
57:10;57:13;"has like the lamest reputation."
57:13;57:15;"Not that it actually is a lame state."
57:15;57:18;"I actually liked growing up there in South Berry."
57:18;57:19;"That's where I'm from."
57:19;57:22;"But its reputation is just really lame"
57:22;57:23;"and easy to bust on."
57:23;57:26;"And Jersey has a great reputation."
57:26;57:27;"Not in the sense-- - Well, Jersey was"
57:27;57:29;"the most hated state for a long time."
57:29;57:30;"- How about this though?"
57:30;57:33;"It's got a romantic, gritty reputation."
57:33;57:36;"It's got a lot of heavy hitters that have come out of there."
57:36;57:39;"It's got great stories about it."
57:39;57:40;"We're talking about the songs of Bruce Springsteen"
57:40;57:41;"or The Sopranos."
57:41;57:43;"- Right."
57:43;57:45;"- It's got a lot of like gravitas."
57:45;57:46;"- So maybe-- - Connecticut has no gravitas."
57:46;57:49;"- Maybe you and Andrew are not that far apart."
57:49;57:50;"- I don't think we are."
57:50;57:51;"- You're just kind of coming at it from different angles."
57:51;57:54;"And look, I don't remember what I said in that episode."
57:54;57:56;"He says, ""I scathingly put Connecticut"
57:56;57:58;"""in the bottom five states regarding music."""
57:58;58:00;"- Okay, well, what does he shout out here?"
58:00;58:01;"He shouts out Rivers Cuomo."
58:01;58:03;"- I knew that he was from Connecticut."
58:03;58:05;"And he says, ""MGMT met in Middletown."""
58:05;58:06;"I knew that."
58:06;58:08;"I'm pretty sure I saw MGMT when I was in college."
58:08;58:09;"- That's tight. - 'Cause I went to go visit"
58:09;58:11;"a buddy at Wesleyan."
58:11;58:12;"- Oh, did you see him there?"
58:12;58:13;"- I think I saw them play."
58:13;58:15;"I'll never know for sure."
58:15;58:16;"- Great band."
58:16;58:18;"And I think we forgot them in our CT discussion."
58:18;58:21;"- Yeah, although they just went to college in CT."
58:21;58:21;"But whatever."
58:21;58:23;"- Yeah, but the band formed in CT."
58:23;58:27;"- Yeah, no, and there's a lot of cool colleges in CT."
58:27;58:27;"What is he?"
58:27;58:28;"- Thurston Moores. - Thurston Moores."
58:28;58:29;"- Bethel."
58:29;58:30;"Okay. - Okay."
58:30;58:31;"- Fair enough."
58:31;58:33;"- Jeff Porcaro, hails from South Windsor."
58:33;58:34;"- This is a stretch."
58:34;58:35;"- I didn't know that."
58:35;58:37;"I mean, he was an incredible drummer."
58:37;58:38;"He played on Thriller."
58:38;58:39;"- Okay."
58:39;58:40;"Oh, Liz Fair is from New Haven."
58:40;58:41;"I did not know that."
58:41;58:43;"- Yeah, I thought of her as being Chicago,"
58:43;58:45;"where I think she started out there."
58:45;58:47;"- And of course, Dirty Projectors."
58:47;58:50;"- He says it's a very dirty move of you"
58:50;58:51;"to not even mention your own brother's band"
58:51;58:53;"in a discussion of Connecticut music."
58:53;58:55;"- Well, I think he was gonna take it for granted."
58:55;58:56;"- Or you know Dave so well,"
58:56;58:59;"the idea of you referring to Dave as a Connecticut musician."
58:59;59:00;"- Yeah, it's a given."
59:00;59:03;"- And Jake, you also mentioned that you couldn't imagine"
59:03;59:04;"moving back to Connecticut now."
59:04;59:06;"Any chance you know of a guy named Keith Richards?"
59:06;59:09;"Ever heard of a guy named Paul Simon?"
59:09;59:10;"Nope, not really."
59:10;59:11;"What about Roger Glover,"
59:11;59:14;"songwriter and bassist of Deep Purple?"
59:14;59:16;"These are all just a few of the distinguished musicians"
59:16;59:18;"that now call CT home."
59:18;59:19;"Although to be fair,"
59:19;59:21;"that's the exact CT that Jake's talking about."
59:21;59:22;"- That's the Southwest corner."
59:22;59:24;"- These are rich dudes in the Southwest corner."
59:24;59:26;"They could have moved to Westchester, Jersey, whatever."
59:26;59:27;"They just found a house they liked in CT."
59:27;59:29;"- They all live together?"
59:29;59:30;"- Yes."
59:30;59:34;"- There's a Baby Boomer rock star gated community"
59:34;59:37;"just outside Stanford."
59:37;59:39;"- Well, here's what I gotta say is that, first of all,"
59:39;59:42;"I respect Andrew because I'm very defensive"
59:42;59:43;"of my home state, New Jersey."
59:43;59:45;"Although you're right, in a funny way,"
59:45;59:47;"over my lifetime, New Jersey's become,"
59:47;59:50;"I don't know, do people still make fun of New Jersey?"
59:50;59:51;"I knew growing up--"
59:51;59:52;"- Yeah, it's like, it stinks."
59:52;59:53;"- Yeah, I remember growing up,"
59:53;59:55;"there was still like the jokes,"
59:55;59:56;"New Jersey smells bad, whatever."
59:56;59:58;"And then when I first got to Columbia,"
59:58;01:00:01;"I was very taken aback when I would meet kids"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"who weren't even from the city."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"'Cause you know, kids who grew up in the city,"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"like I probably have said this on Time Crisis before,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"you know, I was born in Manhattan,"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"lived there for a couple years,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"but I grew up in Jersey."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"So on one part, you know, every generation of my family"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"for a hundred years is born in New York City, including me."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And we've talked about this on my,"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"when I die on Wikipedia, I'll just say born in NYC,"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"died in hopefully someplace interesting."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"- And then it'll say, he's gone."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Oh, right, on my tombstone."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"- Yours will say--"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Wait, what did we decide?"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"- Mine's gonna say he's gone."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"'Cause we're being buried next to each other."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- Oh, right."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"- Mine says he's gone and yours says,"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"and nothing's gonna bring him back."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"- Nothing's gonna bring him back, sick."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"So my, so anyway, when I'm--"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"- TC Graveyard."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"- When I'm dead and buried in,"
01:00:44;01:00:47;"I mean, I guess probably the most likely place is LA."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"If I don't die tragically."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"You know, if I just keep more or less being based out here,"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"even if I started to spend significant amounts of time"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"back on the East Coast,"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"which is kind of the only place I'm interested in going."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"- You need a house in Jersey, dude."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"- It's been discussed."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- You need to get like a house"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"where you can like spend your summers in Jersey."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"- It's been discussed, I gotta recharge my batteries."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- And you like build a recording studio in the garage,"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"you go full springs to the library."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- You know what's crazy?"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"I mean, this is almost sad."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"We got a new car."
01:01:12;01:01:12;"- Yeah?"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- In the household."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- Congrats."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"- Thank you."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I wasn't really part of the decision-making process."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"I have access."
01:01:18;01:01:22;"I have access to the car of the household in which I reside."
01:01:22;01:01:22;"- Okay."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"- It's probably the best way to put it."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"- Is your name on the title?"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"- No."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"- Okay."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"- But I do have a driver's license."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"I have a California driver's license now."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Is that new?"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- Yeah, 'cause my old one expired"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"when I turned, on my last birthday."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"But on the interface of this car,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"you can listen to radio from all over the world."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- Interesting."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"- I mean, the headlines are there like,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"you wanna listen to BBC One in London."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"So you can like throw that on."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"So I've occasionally done that."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"It's like I'm driving, it's like,"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"you know, 4 p.m. in L.A."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"listening to some like late night like techno show on BBC."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- Yeah."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- But also you can get really specific."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"You can say, they'll be like, choose a country."
01:01:59;01:02:02;"I'll be like, what's popping on like Albanian National Radio?"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"- Uh-huh."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- You know, it's all the same (beep)"
01:02:04;01:02:04;"they play everywhere."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"But then you can also get really specific"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"and can be like, do you wanna listen to New York radio?"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"And it'd be like New York City Radio,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Buffalo, New York, Albany, whatever."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"And do you wanna listen to New Jersey Radio?"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"So anyway, I started just out of nostalgia,"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"like looking at the radio stations I grew up with."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"And I've always said, and it's always worth repeating"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"because this is an internet radio show,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"that I was, it was a big part of my life."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"And I think my development as a musician and a person"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"that I was lucky enough to grow up in"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"pre-internet radio times within the broadcast radius"
01:02:34;01:02:38;"of WFMU, which is a free-form radio station in New Jersey"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"where the best shows started."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"- Absolutely."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- So sometimes when I'm driving around in the car,"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"I'll just throw on New Jersey Radio."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"And the other day I was listening to this show"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"that's been on forever out there."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"It's called the Glenn Jones Radio Program"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"featuring X-Ray Burns."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"And they're kinda like Jersey guys."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"They're just talking about music and (beep)"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"and they're telling stories about like growing up"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"in these towns that are very close to where I grew up."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"So I was just like, you know, ripping around LA"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"and you know, just for like a brief moment,"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"just like hearing these guys just talk about Jersey"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"and (beep) I was like, damn, maybe I gotta go back."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"'Cause I've said before on the show,"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"my nostalgia for the East Coast is not about Manhattan"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"or New York City."
01:03:16;01:03:16;"- It's Jersey."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"- Or Brooklyn."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Well, it's about the whole East Coast."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"I would live in Connecticut, by the way."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"- Interesting."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- I think what defines being around the East Coast"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"is Italian people, which you have in New Jersey"
01:03:28;01:03:28;"and Connecticut."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Sure."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"- And Italian delis."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"- There's a great Italian deli in New Haven."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"- Ooh, there's some good Italian food in Connecticut."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"The pizza, the weather."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"- Okay, that's where you lose me a little bit, but okay."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"- I mean, it's part of it."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"- I get it though, I get it."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"- Going down the shore, the accents."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"- That's where you're from, man."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- It truly is the East Coast to me."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"So I would live in Connecticut."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"I love Connecticut."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"I have good memories of Connecticut,"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"but you know, New Jersey is a little bit more"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"where I'm from."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- I think if you were gonna go--"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"- It's all about the region."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"And that's my thing."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"I've always said this about New York,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"is that, and I was saying, when I first got to Columbia,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"I'd meet like kids, some kids from the city,"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"but I'd also meet kids from like up and down"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"the East Coast or California,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"who would immediately develop a snobbery about New Jersey."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"And I'd always be like, what are you talking about?"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"What's cool about the New York region"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"is not necessarily downtown Manhattan."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"I mean, I like downtown Manhattan,"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"I like Brooklyn, whatever."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"But the whole thing that's interesting to me"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"is the fact that there's 30 plus million people"
01:04:27;01:04:31;"living all around here, taking the train in and out."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"And when you're in Midtown,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"there's people from Connecticut, New Jersey,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"and people working during the day and going home."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"And it's like, you know, there's something interesting"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"about the whole ecosystem."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I've always felt that way."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"So I consider Connecticut a part of that."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"- Tri-state area."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"- Tri-state, I think, I remember that's a conversation"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"we had where you said that Connecticut"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"really wasn't pulling its weight in the tri-state."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"- It's really not."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"It's really the bi-state area."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"(laughing)"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"- No, I mean, Connecticut's a part of it."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- No, it is."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"- I like Connecticut."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"And I'm sorry, Andrew, if I gave the impression"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"that I didn't respect Connecticut."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"It's no surprise to me that interesting people"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"come out of Connecticut."
01:05:05;01:05:10;"And keep in mind, again, New Jersey is a much hated state."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"The fact that it's produced anything of note"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"is pretty amazing."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"It's not a cool place."

01:07:03;01:07:04;"at some New Jersey real estate."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- Where does Bruce Springsteen, what city is he in?"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Southern Jersey, right?"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"- He lives in Rumson."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"It's not Southern, it's Central."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"It's not far, that far from where I live."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"But yeah, I think he lives on a farm."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"- He has like a horse farm."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- Yeah, he has horses and (beep)"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"that's like a real rich guy move."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"- I wouldn't do that one day."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Just gotta keep on trucking."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- I just never-- - Do you like horses?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"No, I don't."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I mean, isn't it just kind of a money pit?"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"Yeah, it kinda is, but--"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- Imagine if you're just like--"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"- I just want the status of having horses."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"I don't actually think it's--"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"- I don't think it's like that for Bruce."
01:07:35;01:07:35;"- I know."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- But imagine if you're hanging with Bruce"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"and you're just like,"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"""Jesus, look at the size of that horse."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"""It must be expensive feeding that thing."""
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Is it a real money pit, Bruce?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"You know, man, it's crazy."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- I actually make more money off of the horses now"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"than music."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"You're kidding me."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"- I breed these things."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- You're kidding me, man."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Oh man, I'd have to take the E Street Band out"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"for three to four weeks"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"for what I can make just on one of these ponies."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"Damn, Bruce, that's cool, man."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"- I was on a horse about a month ago."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"(laughing)"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- First time?"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"- No, but first time in about 20 years."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"I did a little horseback riding in Idaho."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- What was that all about?"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"- Well, we went on a little vacation"
01:08:11;01:08:15;"up to a tourist ranch in Stanley, Idaho,"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"which is kind of right at the edge"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"of the Sawtooth Mountains, central Idaho,"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"very beautiful country."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"And we stayed at this nice--"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"- Sawtooth Mountains."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"- Lodge, and you could, if you want,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"it's like that's a thing you can do there."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"You can raft on a river."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"You can do a horseback ride."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"We did both."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"- So you guys--"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"- We flew to Boise."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- How did you make this decision?"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Like a few months ago, you were like,"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"""It'd be nice to get out of town this summer."
01:08:39;01:08:39;"""Where do you wanna go?"""
01:08:39;01:08:40;"And you were just like,"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"""I wanna go to some real pretty country"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"""up near the Sawtooth Mountains."""
01:08:43;01:08:44;"- Hannah has been to this."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"I mean, you want the full backstory?"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- Kind of."
01:08:46;01:08:49;"I'm very interested in why people go on trips."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"- My wife, Hannah--"
01:08:51;01:08:52;"- This is also just like real,"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"just like adult contemporary radio station."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"- Just like the brief moments of talk."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"So how you been?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Well, I just got back from a beautiful ranch"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"up in Idaho, my wife and I headed up there."
01:09:03;01:09:03;"Yeah, I want the backstory."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"- Great wine."
01:09:04;01:09:08;"When she was a teenager,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"she was really into figure skating."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"And up in--"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- Like she did figure skate."
01:09:13;01:09:13;"- Yes."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"So she and her folks went to this"
01:09:15;01:09:19;"figure skating camp or something a few years,"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"which was in Sun Valley, Idaho,"
01:09:22;01:09:23;"which is about an hour and a half"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"from this lodge that we stayed at."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"And so her family somehow got hip to this lodge"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"and they stayed there one year."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"And then her mom was a journalist"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"and wrote a piece about the lodge,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"which was published in the New York Times."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"- That's major for a lodge--"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"- And so--"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"- In the Sawtooth Mountains."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"- And actually her article is framed"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"hanging in the hallway of this lodge still."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"- That's sick."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"- And the article's from about 20 years ago."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"So Hannah and her family have been back"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"to that lodge a few times."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- So what were the activities that you enjoyed"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"if you didn't enjoy the horse riding?"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"- This is almost a ""This Show Rules"" moment."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"(laughing)"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"This is the most like,"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"we're just like having lunch."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"(laughing)"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"What's up man?"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"I saw you next to Graham, you went to Idaho."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"- Oh yeah, it was a gorgeous trip."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"- Yeah man, it was, well I sat on the porch,"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"I did some drawing, I wrote some lyrics,"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"I did some--"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- Oh tight."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- I read part of a Philip Roth novel."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"- Oh 'cause he had just died?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"You thought you'd break him off?"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- Yeah I was like, I've never read ""American Pastora"","
01:10:20;01:10:21;"I wanna dive into that."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- Takes place in Jersey."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"- That's a real Jersey, have you read that book?"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"- Oh yeah, that's a classic Jersey novel."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"- I was thinking about you actually."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah and you know."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"- And yeah, there are a lot of cities"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"that takes place in Morristown,"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"which is one county over from where I grew up."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"- A lot of Newark."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"- Oh yeah, first it starts in Newark."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- A lot of Manhattan too."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"It's a real tri-state area kind of book."
01:10:38;01:10:41;"- Right, a few passing scenes in seat two."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"- Did some fun rafting, did some horseback riding,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"did some solo hiking."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"- In the Sawtooth Mountains?"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"- Oh yeah, solo."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"- Solo in the Sawtooth."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"- Yeah."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"Went off the trail, did a little bushwhacking."
01:10:52;01:10:52;"- Oh really?"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"- I was like, you know what?"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- That's dangerous."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- It was, but I was like, it wasn't dangerous,"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"but I was like, 'cause one of those trails"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"where you like hike out and back,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"and I hiked out down to this lake"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"and then I was like, ooh I bet if I just like"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"walk over that ridge there,"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"I'll be able to see the road."
01:11:07;01:11:07;"Worked out great."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"- You were right."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- As Tom Cray's listeners know,"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"I'm just like, I just have a hard time with vacations."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"- I know you're on like a no travel vibe,"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"'cause you tour, I get it."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"- Well you know what, in the past few months,"
01:11:19;01:11:22;"we did a show and I've been kind of kicking into gear"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"for the album and stuff,"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"so I've made a few more trips to London."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"And I do find that I have like a sentimental connection"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"to London and England, the whole UK."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- I dig it."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"- So I'm just kind of like excited to be there."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"- But like going to Utah to like check out"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"like Zion National Park, that's not in your wheelhouse?"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"- No, I mean we've talked about this,"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"we gotta go on a camping trip."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"- Right."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"- Just because I've never done it."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"I can imagine it's one of those things,"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"kind of like fasting, as we've talked about,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"that you know the first couple days,"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"you're like what is this?"
01:11:51;01:11:54;"And suddenly you're like possessed by this clarity"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"and energy you haven't known in years."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I can imagine that's what it'd be like to go camping,"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"that at first you're just like,"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"the (beep) I feel dirty,"
01:12:02;01:12:05;"I don't have access to my snack drawer,"
01:12:05;01:12:06;"I don't have wifi or whatever,"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"and then like a few days in you're just like,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"I can't, you know, I feel reborn."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Is that how you feel?"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- I don't know if I'd say reborn."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"It's rewarding, but I don't,"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"I mean I'm not a very melodramatic guy."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"Like what situation would I be in where I'm like,"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"dude I'm so reborn right now?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"- Just completed a half marathon?"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"- No, I would be like, oh dude."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"Let's hike part of the John Muir Trail next year, dude."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- I guess I never feel reborn either."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"- I'd love to do like a southern Utah,"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"northern Arizona trip, I think that would be cool."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"You know, it's like a couple trips that I wanna do."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"- I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before,"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"but just real quick, when you're hiking, what's happening?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Is this one foot after the other, just like--"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"- Yeah, you're zoned out."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"- You're not--"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"- I mean you could have earbuds in."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"- You're not talking to your hiking companions?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"- Frequently you are."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"It's better to talk 'cause then it goes by."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"I mean it is deeply pointless."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"- I guess--"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"- And frequently painful."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"- I mean I'm a bit of a city slicker,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"but I do admire nature."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"You know, lately I've been--"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"- Admire."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"- Like lately I've been really into watching"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Planet Earth 2 a lot."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- Nice, dude."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"- So sick."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"I like animals, I like to watch animals."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"My last kind of vacation I guess was,"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"I don't know if I, I can't remember if I talked about this,"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"the time crisis timeline is crazy."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"But remember we prerecorded an episode fairly recently"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"because I was in Japan?"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"- Yeah."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"- 'Cause we were on tour,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"so we played the festival in Australia,"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"and then we played the festival in Japan"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"right after Bob Dylan, which was tight."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Watched him side stage."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"- Wow."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"- But so we had about a week off in Tokyo."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"Great city, had some friends out there."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"Among them Ariel and Danielle came out,"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Danielle Haim, she performed with us."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"And so we had like a week of just like chilling,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"walking around, and you know, in a way,"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"that was deeply pointless too."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"It's like you just walk around Tokyo,"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"kinda no destination in mind,"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"pop into stores, look at things,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"drank a lot of coffee."
01:13:56;01:13:57;"- That was starting to drive me crazy."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"- It felt pretty surreal when we got to like day five."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"- What are we doing?"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"- But there was something where I kinda felt like,"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"I did feel like, okay, this is different than normal life."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"Some days put down like 20,000 steps."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Some days just be drinking that like fourth coffee"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"of the day at like 5.30."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"- Jesus."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"- Just sitting in a cafe."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"But there was something about it that just felt like,"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"on one hand, deeply pointless."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Partially because we'd been to Japan before,"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"so it was interesting just to walk around."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"It wasn't like that kinda tense feeling of like,"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"we have to go see the temple,"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"then we have to go to the museum."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"- Right, right."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"- Then we have to go to this one restaurant,"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"somebody tells us."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"It was like everything was just like mellow."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"- Nice."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"- Just kinda one foot after the other,"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"looking at this, looking at that."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Somebody in the gang wants to go to that store,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"walk into the store, just kinda look around."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Sometimes I cared, sometimes I didn't."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"And there's something about that that I imagine"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"maybe is how you feel about hiking."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"Just gliding through an interesting place,"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"looking around, not putting too much thought"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"into every little thing."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- It's the journey, not the destination."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Exactly."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"But I'd like to try it out in nature."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"- Well, I'm game, dude."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"TC road trip."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"- Should we do the top five?"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- It's time for the top five."
01:15:07;01:15:11;"Five on iTunes."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"- Today on the top five,"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"we're gonna compare the top five Billboard hits"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"of this week in 1977"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"with the top five songs on iTunes today."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Why '77?"
01:15:20;01:15:23;"Because it's the year that Jake and John Mayer"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"were born in Connecticut."
01:15:25;01:15:29;"Number five single this week in 1977"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"was by the Floaters and it's called ""Float On."""
01:15:32;01:15:35;"- It's also worth noting that we've done 77,"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"like probably four or five times this year,"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"and it is always abysmal."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"- It tends to be brutal."
01:15:41;01:15:45;"- It is truly like the dregs of pop music."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"- Even though there's such great music from that time."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"- It wasn't in the top five."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"- Let's see if the Floaters ""Float On"" is good."

01:38:12;01:38:15;"- Well, I think there's like a normal speed"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"and then they shift into high gear halfway through"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"each verse is the structure."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"- Well, the one critique I've seen"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"is people just being like, the Joe Budden critique"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"is like, you're not saying anything."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"You're just rapping really fast."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"- My, he's so technically skilled,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"but the problem I have now is that I just feel like"
01:38:35;01:38:38;"I don't wanna like, I don't have to pause the track"
01:38:38;01:38:39;"and be like, what did he say?"
01:38:39;01:38:42;"Let me think about like, oh, and then like 30 seconds later"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"be like, wow, that was such a clever line."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"I want it to hit me like immediately."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"- Right. - Like he used to."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"It's so elaborate now."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"- Like Prague, dude."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"- Prague?"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"- Prague rock."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"- Oh yeah."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"- It's so technically accomplished"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"and it's like emotionally detached."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"- Yeah, totally."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"- So what's the song about?"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"- It's like, get out of my way."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"- It seems like there's a lot of content in there."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"- It's about Eminem getting the weight off his chest."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"- The whole album is like angry old man rap."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"- Does he go in on Trump anymore?"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"- No, he actually, he talks about how he regrets"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"that Trump freestyle because he-"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"- But he said in this song that if he said it, he meant it."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"- Well, there's another part of the album"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"where he says like-"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"- That's a hot coffee pot."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"He regrets it?"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"Why?"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"- Because he talks about-"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"- That's like the most (beep)"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"(mimics Eminem)"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"Yeah, I get it."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"It's too easy to make fun of Eminem now."
01:39:31;01:39:34;"That's because it's just like, it is just too fast."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"And especially like a lot of rap is slow now."
01:39:36;01:39:38;"- He's like the Joe Santriani of-"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"- I think to enjoy him now, you need like-"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"- Don't keep going with this."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"- You need that two screen experience."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"You need like the lyrics page open, reading along."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"- So you're listening to this verse, it's hard as hell"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"and then you slow it down and you're like, hold on."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"Did you just say ""Friends"" is better than ""Seinfeld""?"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"(laughing)"
01:39:51;01:39:54;"(mimics Eminem)"
01:39:54;01:39:59;"- Can't believe he said that."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"- What the hell?"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"- Wait, so what did he say about the"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"awfully hot coffee pot rap?"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"- Well, he just talks about how it reduced his audience"
01:40:05;01:40:09;"and his album sales suffered."
01:40:09;01:40:13;"A lot of the album is about how his last album was a flop"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"and it comes up like throughout the album,"
01:40:15;01:40:16;"which is such a weird-"
01:40:16;01:40:18;"- Was that album really a flop?"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"- Don't quote me on this,"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"but I think it was his worst performing album."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"It still debuted at number one,"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"but I think it dropped off."
01:40:23;01:40:26;"- But isn't that just gonna happen?"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"Not only with his career being 20 years deep,"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"but also the way music is not bought today,"
01:40:31;01:40:35;"that every album is gonna be progressively less of a sell."
01:40:35;01:40:39;"I'm sure Ezra's anticipating that with his upcoming record."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"- I better start rapping faster."
01:40:41;01:40:44;"Yeah, well, it's harder to sell records"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"and even Vampire Weekend, we came up in the days between,"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"which is the iTunes era,"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"which is between physical and streaming."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"It would be very hard to sell as many records"
01:40:54;01:40:55;"as we did in the past,"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"even if this is our best record, which it might be."
01:40:58;01:41:01;"- I'm sure it is your best record, but that's irrelevant."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"- I'm really not even sweating it,"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"but it's like, here's the thing,"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"as I understand it, and I've been out of the game"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"a long time, we're starting to plan stuff for the record"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"and a lot of times I'm just like,"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"I don't even know about this (beep)"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Who cares?"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"But- - Dig that."
01:41:14;01:41:17;"- The people who tend to sell a lot of records"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"just stream a lot."
01:41:19;01:41:22;"It gets a little convoluted because back in the day,"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"if you sold a record, you sold a record."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"Today, you could go stream ""Girls Like You"""
01:41:26;01:41:30;"by Maroon 5 10 times, or 1,000 times,"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"I forget what the rule is,"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"and somebody might count that as a record."
01:41:33;01:41:36;"You may have literally never engaged with the rest of it."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"It's like singles and records bleed into each other"
01:41:38;01:41:41;"and basically to sell anything now,"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"to put up big numbers, you need hits."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"- Sounds like a mess."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- It's a mess."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"(laughing)"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- Jeb-ism."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"- That's an awfully hot coffee pot."
01:41:49;01:41:53;"Should I say that ""Friends"" is better than ""Seinfeld""?"
01:41:53;01:41:55;"(laughing)"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"It's ""Seinfeld"" 2000."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"(laughing)"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"- There's like angry moments."
01:42:00;01:42:04;"Just turning on a dime."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"The number two song, 1977, Rita Coolidge,"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"""Your Love Has Lifted Me Higher and Higher""."

01:42:51;01:42:52;"- Yeah, this is number two."
01:42:52;01:42:52;"- 'Cause she was a country artist."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"- Oh, Rita Coolidge was?"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"- Yeah, I think she was married to Chris Christopherson."
01:42:56;01:42:56;"- Really?"

01:43:13;01:43:14;"- Yeah, not so hot."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"- It's cool, but whatever."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"And anyway, I wanna get back to the number two song"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"on iTunes right now, 'cause guess what?"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"It's also by Eminem."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"(explosion)"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"- Wow."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"- And Seinfeld 2000 thinks that Seinfeld"

01:43:39;01:43:41;"(laughing)"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"- It's called The Ringer."

01:43:44;01:43:44;"Oh."
01:43:44;01:43:50;"This is the opening track on the album,"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"where he unleashes a salvo of shots"

01:43:54;01:43:55;"- Ooh."
01:43:55;01:43:59;"- Bon Iver is on this album."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"- Really?"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"- Yeah."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"- Oh, right."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"- And he like disavowed his participation in it."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Why?"
01:44:05;01:44:09;"- Because Eminem launched a homophobic slur"
01:44:09;01:44:12;"at Tyler, the Creator, and Justin Vernon was like,"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"I wasn't really that involved in this song."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"- Justin Vernon helped me write the verse"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"about Tyler, the Creator, buddy!"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"(laughing)"
01:44:20;01:44:30;"- On opening track, The Ringer,"
01:44:30;01:44:33;"Eminem takes a preemptive shot at Bon Iver."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"(laughing)"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Who he imagines will disavow himself"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"after he hears his homophobic rant."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"- It was so weird when Eminem collaborated"
01:44:40;01:44:43;"with Ed Sheeran on the last album."
01:44:43;01:44:44;"- He did?"
01:44:44;01:44:45;"Wow."

01:45:04;01:45:05;"Isn't like pick on somebody your own size?"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"- Eminem is 45."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"- Don't ask me."
01:45:08;01:45:08;"- You know."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"- Also, that was pretty fun."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Yeah, Jake Wayne on this one."
01:45:11;01:45:14;"That's also kind of like a meme is about like"

01:45:18;01:45:19;"- Right."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"(laughing)"
01:45:20;01:45:21;"- I guess the other thing you can say is like,"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"I don't know if the 45 year old thing applies with Eminem"
01:45:23;01:45:26;"'cause hip hop's always had that wrestling quality"

01:45:29;01:45:31;"Although it's funny, if you're gonna diss Lil Yachty,"
01:45:31;01:45:35;"why even say some people like Lil Yachty, not me."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"I'm just saying it's not for me."

01:45:42;01:45:44;"- It's a weird take."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"- Yeah, it's like, okay, then maybe you don't need"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"to put Lil Yachty in this song."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"- Well, there are other people he goes for"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"without disclaiming at all, but Lil Yachty for some reason."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"- This is my song about the mumble rappers that I hate."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Lil Yachty shouldn't even be in this song."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Let me be clear."

01:49:03;01:49:05;"- I don't like young people."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"- I remember there's, like--"
01:49:07;01:49:10;"there was a Brian Wilson album from, like, the early 2000s,"

01:49:23;01:49:25;"The whole reason Eminem's so easy to parody"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"is because he's accomplished so much."

01:50:30;01:50:32;"- No, not at all. - I think he comes across"
