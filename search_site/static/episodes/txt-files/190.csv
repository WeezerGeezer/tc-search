00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:04;00:11;"On this week's TC, we talk about Fairport Convention."
00:11;00:17;"We also listen to music from the old days and the new."
00:17;00:23;"We'll hear great songs from the B-52s, Alana Miles and Janet Jackson."
00:23;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"You were a belt from a knee, all my rightful chances"
00:47;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:17;"Keep an eye on me babe"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:21;"Gentlemen."
01:21;01:24;"Hell of a winner. Hell of a winner."
01:24;01:29;"I've been obsessed with my Twitter feed looking at the"
01:29;01:33;"historic snowpack that has accumulated in the Sierra Nevada."
01:33;01:37;"Oh right, and that's the one that a few years ago they were like, ""There's nothing there."""
01:37;01:42;"Well, it'll all melt this year. I mean, it's not like a glacier, but it snows every winter up there."
01:42;01:46;"But this is like one of the, depending on what source you're looking at,"
01:46;01:50;"one of the top three snowpacks ever recorded."
01:50;01:51;"Wow."
01:51;01:55;"'52 was a big year. '82-'83 winter was huge."
01:55;01:56;"Mm."
01:56;01:58;"2023 winter, massive."
01:58;02:01;"Interesting. So that's just because of all this precipitation?"
02:01;02:09;"Yeah. Just all these atmospheric rivers that, you know, manifest as rain in the lower elevations, but massive."
02:09;02:13;"For people who don't live in Southern California, it's been a very cold, rainy winter."
02:13;02:19;"I've been feeling it. I've been listening to Fairport Convention, which I think is the greatest winter band."
02:19;02:22;"Interesting. I didn't know you were a Fairport head."
02:22;02:27;"That's winter music for me. I couldn't imagine listening to it in the summer, but I don't know."
02:27;02:29;"I don't know. Just it's raining outside."
02:29;02:30;"What?"
02:30;02:32;"I don't know. It's something about that sort of..."
02:32;02:33;"You're really surprising me here."
02:33;02:34;"All right."
02:34;02:38;"I'm a massive Fairport fan as well. I don't know if we've ever gotten deep on it,"
02:38;02:43;"but the fact that you said you couldn't imagine listening to them in the summer, I respect it,"
02:43;02:48;"but it's kookier of a position than I associate with you."
02:48;02:55;"I mean, most bands I feel like you can listen to all year round, but some bands just have like a summery vibe,"
02:55;03:00;"and some bands have a wintry vibe, and I would say Fairport Convention is as wintry as it gets."
03:00;03:06;"Something about that kind of English folk rock frog with the Sandy Denny vocals."
03:06;03:09;"I was about to say the Sandy Denny vocals, the cold, distant voices."
03:09;03:10;"And the lyrics."
03:10;03:11;"Sandy Denny."
03:11;03:14;"Reinterpreting these old English folk songs."
03:14;03:18;"Although I think one of their classic albums is called What We Did on Our Summer Holidays."
03:18;03:20;"Yeah, but I don't care."
03:20;03:26;"Interesting. I'm a massive Fairport fan. I'm sure we must have talked about them over the years, but like..."
03:26;03:27;"I think they've come up."
03:27;03:31;"Yeah, they're great. What's your favorite Fairport song?"
03:31;03:34;"I've been really into Percy's song recently."
03:34;03:35;"Oh, the Bob Dylan song."
03:35;03:36;"Yeah."
03:36;03:41;"Yeah, that's an interesting one too, because Bob Dylan wrote Percy's song,"
03:41;03:46;"and I think it was only available as a bootleg, probably."
03:46;03:47;"It's not on an album."
03:47;03:49;"And it's not from the basement tapes either, I don't think."
03:49;03:50;"No."
03:50;03:52;"I don't know what era that would be from."
03:52;03:55;"I guess people talk about he's the original bootleg artist that..."
03:55;03:58;"Kind of pretty similar to Kanye now."
03:58;04:02;"I'm not trying to talk about all the other Kanye stuff, but just like, there's Kanye fans"
04:02;04:07;"who have over the years heard like almost albums worth of leaked material."
04:07;04:10;"Songs that never came out, verses, whatever."
04:10;04:13;"And I think the same was true for Bob Dylan in the 60s."
04:13;04:17;"So Fairport probably heard Percy's song on a bootleg,"
04:17;04:21;"and then they did a cover of it for their album."
04:21;04:24;"Maybe he made a writing demo and sent it out,"
04:24;04:27;"because he also was kind of just like a working songwriter."
04:27;04:30;"Yeah, because there's a lot of that stuff that's on like,"
04:30;04:33;"Sweetheart of the Rodeo and stuff that if you were like a good band..."
04:33;04:34;"You ain't going nowhere. Yeah."
04:34;04:37;"You probably like maybe had access to those tapes."
04:37;04:41;"But was his Percy song like a rewrite of an old song?"
04:41;04:46;"I think it's similar to a lot of, you know, 60s Dylan,"
04:46;04:51;"where he's totally using folk form that comes from an old folk song."
04:51;04:55;"So my understanding is, because this song, for people who don't know it,"
04:55;04:59;"it has this refrain where he's telling a story."
04:59;05:01;"And then, you know, he says something like,"
05:01;05:04;"I sat down and wrote the best words I could write."
05:04;05:07;"Turn, turn, turn again."
05:07;05:10;"And I turned to the air on Wednesday night."
05:10;05:13;"Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."
05:13;05:15;"Rain and the wind, dude."
05:15;05:16;"Yeah, I've looked it up before."
05:16;05:19;"Yeah, you're right. That is a very wintry song."
05:19;05:20;"I've looked it up before."
05:20;05:23;"And yeah, that turn to the rain and the wind."
05:23;05:27;"And even that structure has its roots in a bunch of old folk songs"
05:27;05:30;"where you say something and then turn to the rain and the wind."
05:30;05:32;"It's also interesting because it's like,"
05:32;05:35;"when I think of Bob Dylan's story songs from this era,"
05:35;05:37;"I think of like the lonesome death of Hattie Carroll"
05:37;05:39;"or things about these like civil rights issues."
05:39;05:44;"And this one, it's still about pain and suffering and death,"
05:44;05:46;"but it's just like a little more mundane."
05:46;05:50;"My understanding of the song is that a guy hears his buddy got in a car accident."
05:50;05:52;"He's like, oh man, what happened?"
05:52;05:55;"He's like, yeah, he wasn't drunk or anything."
05:55;05:57;"It was just kind of one of those situations,"
05:57;05:59;"but the people in the other car died."
05:59;06:02;"Like, oh my God, that's crazy. Is he okay?"
06:02;06:03;"He's like, he's actually in jail."
06:03;06:06;"It's like, really? It's like, yeah."
06:06;06:08;"There's like a real hard ass judge trying to lock him up."
06:08;06:10;"He really didn't do anything wrong."
06:10;06:12;"Could have been you or me, just like one of these things."
06:12;06:14;"It's like, wrong place, wrong time."
06:14;06:16;"I'm writing a letter to the judge. I'm going to come."
06:16;06:19;"It's also like a bit of a shaggy dog story."
06:19;06:21;"Not trying to spoil it, but it's like,"
06:21;06:24;"it doesn't particularly end in some like big dramatic way, right?"
06:24;06:28;"You're so much more the lyricist guy than I am."
06:28;06:29;"You're just vibing. I'm vibing."
06:29;06:30;"Enjoying those beautiful harmonies."
06:30;06:32;"Yeah. And just the feel."
06:32;06:33;"All right, let's throw it on."
06:33;06:39;"Bad news, bad news, come to me where I sleep."
06:39;06:42;"Turn, turn, turn again."
06:42;06:44;"Yeah, Sandy Denny, just one of the all-time great singers."
06:44;06:49;"Say one of your friends is in trouble deep."
06:49;06:56;"Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."
06:56;06:59;"You got the message, one of your friends is in trouble deep."
06:59;07:04;"Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear."
07:04;07:09;"Turn, turn, turn again."
07:09;07:14;"Joliet prison, I'm 99 years."
07:14;07:15;"Okay, Joliet prison, Illinois."
07:15;07:16;"99 years, yeah, all right."
07:16;07:17;"Okay."
07:17;07:19;"Turn to the rain and the wind."
07:19;07:24;"Okay, so yeah, these British folk rock musicians singing about Joliet, Illinois."
07:24;07:29;"Oh, what's the charge of how this came to be?"
07:29;07:30;"Turn, turn, turn again."
07:30;07:34;"Pictures just like Bob Dylan being like undergrad at University of Minnesota."
07:34;07:37;"Some of the homies road tripping in Illinois."
07:37;07:39;"Got in a car accident."
07:39;07:41;"Yeah, heard a story."
07:41;07:44;"Your boy's looking down at 99 years."
07:44;07:48;"For manslaughter?"
07:48;07:54;"I sat down and wrote the best words I could write."
07:54;07:58;"Turn, turn, turn again."
07:58;08:03;"I also do love this song too because it's like there just aren't that many songs about friends."
08:03;08:11;"Of course, there's plenty, but obviously you got the love, romance, takes the biggest piece of the pie."
08:11;08:15;"And this is a song just about like, damn, your buddy's in prison."
08:15;08:18;"All right. I'm worried about my homie."
08:18;08:19;"Right, yeah."
08:19;08:22;"Just like my friend. Dude, my friend's in trouble deep."
08:22;08:23;"Yeah."
08:23;08:28;"I was in his chambers by the next stop of his."
08:28;08:34;"Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."
08:34;08:37;"Yeah, I listen to this song on repeat when I'm working."
08:37;08:38;"Yeah."
08:38;08:41;"Tell me the facts. I said without a doubt."
08:41;08:44;"Then that like 12th string electric comes in."
08:44;08:47;"Tell me the facts. I said without fear."
08:47;08:53;"That a friend of mine would get 99 years."
08:53;08:55;"A friend of mine could get 99 years."
08:55;08:56;"Messed up."
08:56;09:01;"Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."
09:01;09:07;"A crash on the highway blew the car to a fear."
09:07;09:10;"Turn, turn, turn again."
09:10;09:12;"That reminds me of that Bruce song too, Wrecking the Highway."
09:12;09:13;"Oh, right."
09:13;09:15;"He finds that guy dying on the side of the road."
09:15;09:18;"And then he goes home and sees his baby in the crib."
09:18;09:21;"I think he just sees his, he refers to his wife as his baby."
09:21;09:23;"Oh, okay."
09:23;09:24;"And he's just like, the baby's sleeping."
09:24;09:25;"Right, I see."
09:25;09:26;"That's how I do it."
09:26;09:31;"But I knew him I could as I knowing myself."
09:31;09:35;"Turn, turn, turn again."
09:35;09:40;"And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else."
09:40;09:45;"He wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else."
09:45;09:50;"Just like, I get a call from Nick like, dude, Ezra's in prison right now, man."
09:50;09:51;"No, he like, he wasn't drunk."
09:51;09:54;"He like was driving."
09:54;09:57;"It's unclear what happened, but like the other people in the other car are dead."
09:57;09:59;"He's looking at time."
09:59;10:02;"I was just road tripping in Illinois."
10:02;10:03;"That's really intense."
10:03;10:09;"And then you're like, just call me back in the morning."
10:09;10:10;"And then you're like, dude, I'm on a road trip."
10:10;10:12;"You're sick in the Champaign-Urbana area."
10:12;10:14;"Damn."
10:14;10:16;"That may be true."
10:16;10:19;"He's got a sentence to serve."
10:19;10:24;"Turn, turn, turn again."
10:24;10:29;"But 99 years he just don't deserve."
10:29;10:35;"Turn, turn, too late and the wind."
10:35;10:36;"I'm really curious."
10:36;10:37;"How does this end?"
10:37;10:40;"This like ends on some like, oh wait, we're coming down."
10:40;10:43;"For his case to seal."
10:43;10:45;"Turn, turn, turn again."
10:45;10:46;"He got there too late."
10:46;10:48;"I mean, what was Bob Dylan going to do to the judge anyway?"
10:48;10:53;"His sentence, it is passed and cannot be revealed."
10:53;11:02;"Turn, turn, to the right and the left."
11:02;11:07;"But he ain't no criminal and his crime it is love."
11:07;11:12;"Turn, turn, turn again."
11:12;11:17;"What happened to him could happen to anyone."
11:17;11:26;"Turn, turn, to the right and the left."
11:26;11:31;"And that the judge jerked forward and his case it did approve."
11:31;11:36;"Turn, turn, turn again."
11:36;11:41;"Said could you kindly leave my office now please."
11:41;11:42;"Judge, get the hell out of here."
11:42;11:44;"Get the hell out of here."
11:44;11:46;"Case closed."
11:46;11:47;"I got a lot of cases today."
11:47;11:49;"I don't have time for--"
11:49;11:51;"My docket is full."
11:51;11:53;"The docket's crazy right now."
11:53;11:55;"I can't talk to everybody's buddy."
11:55;12:00;"Turn, turn, turn again."
12:00;12:07;"With no other choice except for to turn, turn,"
12:07;12:10;"turn to the right and the left."
12:10;12:19;"I walked down the hallway and I heard him moan and slam."
12:19;12:24;"Turn, turn, turn again."
12:24;12:29;"I walked down the cold hard stairs and did not understand."
12:29;12:33;"Turn, turn, to the right and the left."
12:33;12:35;"Oh, I remember how it ends now."
12:35;12:38;"It's a beautiful ending, haunting ending."
12:38;12:43;"And I played my guitar through the night to the day."
12:43;12:44;"I played my guitar."
12:44;12:46;"He left the court out, didn't understand,"
12:46;12:48;"played my guitar through the night and the day."
12:48;12:49;"Writing the song?"
12:49;12:54;"But the only tune my guitar could play was the old--"
12:54;12:55;"The old sad--"
12:55;12:59;"Oh, the cruel rain and the wind."
12:59;13:01;"So whatever song this is like semi-based on,"
13:01;13:04;"it's he's being meta, he's referencing it."
13:04;13:05;"Very Bob."
13:06;13:10;"Whether he's writing about the Titanic or, you know,"
13:10;13:12;"the actor in Brownsville Girl."
13:12;13:14;"Yep, 'cause when you really think about that song,"
13:14;13:18;"it's interesting because he's telling the story,"
13:18;13:19;"and because it's a folk song,"
13:19;13:21;"you don't think too much that there's a refrain,"
13:21;13:23;"turn, turn to the rain and the wind,"
13:23;13:25;"which would totally make sense."
13:25;13:27;"You know, you're basically like, got a call."
13:27;13:28;"Right."
13:28;13:29;"My buddy's in trouble."
13:29;13:30;"I wrote to the judge."
13:30;13:32;"I'm heading there."
13:32;13:33;"It's chaotic."
13:33;13:34;"What happened?"
13:34;13:35;"What's going on?"
13:35;13:36;"I finally get there."
13:36;13:37;"And just throughout, he's going,"
13:37;13:40;"turn, turn to the rain and the wind."
13:40;13:42;"And you're kind of like, what does that mean?"
13:42;13:43;"In this--"
13:43;13:44;"Turning into harshness."
13:44;13:45;"Right."
13:45;13:49;"I think it is just kind of about accepting the harshness of life,"
13:49;13:50;"but you're kind of like, well, yeah,"
13:50;13:51;"where are you going with this?"
13:51;13:54;"Both buddies are turning to the rain and the wind."
13:54;13:56;"Actually, I think we've got to kind of look up"
13:56;13:58;"the old cruel rain and the wind,"
13:58;14:01;"because whatever that song is actually saying,"
14:01;14:04;"just the refrain of the old cruel rain and the wind,"
14:04;14:07;"I mean, you're just talking about nature,"
14:07;14:09;"the cruelty of nature."
14:09;14:11;"Obviously, in this circumstance, you could say,"
14:11;14:12;"well, it's the cruelty of man."
14:12;14:15;"Why is this judge such a hard on?"
14:15;14:16;"99 years?"
14:16;14:17;"Come on, man."
14:17;14:19;"Could have happened to you or me."
14:19;14:20;"Nobody did it on purpose."
14:20;14:21;"How could you be so harsh?"
14:21;14:23;"You know, Bob could have taken that--"
14:23;14:28;"his kind of righteous indignation '60s energy about the judge,"
14:28;14:30;"but it's almost more like it happened."
14:30;14:31;"He walks out bewildered."
14:31;14:33;"Buddy's going down for 99 years."
14:33;14:34;"He's just standing there on the courthouse steps,"
14:34;14:36;"and all he can think about is this old folk song"
14:36;14:38;"about the old cruel rain and the wind."
14:38;14:41;"Just nature, man, the harshness of life."
14:41;14:42;"Simple twist of fate."
14:42;14:43;"Yeah."
14:43;14:45;"Cold rain and snow."
14:45;14:46;"Yeah, right."
14:46;14:48;"I wonder if he ever did a version of that."
14:48;14:53;"Obviously, the famously folk song, ""The Dead,"" played a lot."
14:53;14:55;"Yeah, Fairport, great band."
14:55;14:57;"Incredible arrangement, too."
14:57;15:01;"I mean, it's this incredibly repetitive structure,"
15:01;15:06;"and the lyrics are so repetitive as well that to make that really dynamic"
15:06;15:09;"and kind of crescendo and come down and then crescendo again"
15:09;15:11;"and come back down, it's--"
15:11;15:14;"I just love that recording being able to just like, oh,"
15:14;15:15;"they're bringing in the organ here."
15:15;15:16;"The organ cuts out."
15:16;15:18;"Oh, they're bringing in the--"
15:18;15:20;"Richard Thompson's going off on the acoustic."
15:20;15:23;"Oh, now they're bringing in the electric."
15:23;15:25;"Yeah, and it follows the narrative, like what's happening?"
15:25;15:26;"It's like--"
15:26;15:27;"Chills out."
15:27;15:28;"Nothing's happening."
15:28;15:30;"Got there too late."
15:30;15:32;"This is one of my favorite Fairports."
15:32;15:35;"And they have some like bangers, too, but like a truly beautiful one."
15:35;15:37;"You know this one, ""Farewell, Farewell""?"
15:37;15:38;"Of course."
15:38;15:39;"Love it."
15:39;15:42;"[MUSIC - ""FAREWELL, FAREWELL""]"
15:42;15:55;"(SINGING) Farewell, farewell to you who'd hit."
15:55;15:56;"Did they write this one?"
15:56;15:59;"(SINGING) You lonely traveler's own."
15:59;16:00;"That's the thing I like about this band."
16:00;16:03;"I don't even know what songs they write, what songs they don't."
16:03;16:06;"(SINGING) The cold north wind will blow again."
16:06;16:07;"See, this is what I'm saying."
16:07;16:08;"It's a winter band."
16:08;16:11;"(SINGING) The winding road."
16:11;16:12;"It's pouring rain outside."
16:12;16:14;"I'm just like, I'm throwing up."
16:14;16:15;"Airport, dude, I'm making a cup of tea."
16:15;16:16;"""Withered and Died."""
16:16;16:18;"Dude, well, that's on the--"
16:18;16:20;"That's Richard Thatcher and Linda Thompson."
16:20;16:24;"That song, but ""Withered and Died"" is one of the ultimate winter songs."
16:24;16:25;"Gonna say so."
16:25;16:26;"Yeah."
16:26;16:27;"I love this part."
16:27;16:30;"(SINGING) Oh, I would."
16:30;16:32;"I would."
16:32;16:36;"If welcome I was."
16:36;16:39;"Oh, they would loathe me."
16:39;16:41;"My understanding, because I've heard of--"
16:41;16:42;"This is traditional."
16:42;16:43;"This is?"
16:43;16:44;"Yeah."
16:44;16:45;"What's your understanding?"
16:45;16:46;"There's another song."
16:46;16:48;"I guess this happens a lot with folk songs"
16:48;16:51;"that I thought maybe they wrote the lyrics to this"
16:51;16:54;"because this is this beautiful goodbye song."
16:54;16:57;"Also, this is-- the vibe of this, too."
16:57;16:59;"Obviously, Sandy Denny's voice is so distinct"
16:59;17:02;"and makes it very wintry England."
17:02;17:04;"But couldn't you totally picture Lou Reed singing on this?"
17:04;17:06;"This should be like a Velvet song."
17:06;17:07;"Totally."
17:07;17:09;"Or Mo Tucker."
17:09;17:11;"Or yeah, I could see Yola Tango covering this."
17:11;17:12;"Oh, yeah."
17:12;17:23;"(SINGING) We will never cut the cloth or drink the light to be."
17:23;17:30;"But I'll swear ye to wander lies."
17:30;17:34;"Asleep along the side of the pond."
17:34;17:36;"There's another band from this era called Pentangle."
17:36;17:37;"Have you ever gone deep on this stuff?"
17:37;17:38;"Oh, yeah."
17:38;17:39;"Pentangle."
17:39;17:43;"My parents loved Pentangle, so I listened to them a ton growing up."
17:43;17:45;"For some reason, they didn't know it was Fairport."
17:45;17:46;"Interesting."
17:46;17:52;"(SINGING) The king has been a prisoner."
17:52;17:53;"It's called Willie of Winsbury."
17:53;18:00;"(SINGING) And a prisoner long in Spain."
18:00;18:11;"And Willie of the Winsbury has lain long with his daughter."
18:11;18:14;"The Fairport arrangements, they just make these songs their own."
18:14;18:16;"Well, this is '90s Pentangle."
18:16;18:17;"This is probably a different recording."
18:17;18:20;"Oh, wow."
18:20;18:21;"Oh, yeah."
18:21;18:22;"I'm hearing that."
18:22;18:25;"It's a '90s piano tone."
18:25;18:28;"Do you know that Pentangle song, ""Trees They Do Grow High""?"
18:28;18:29;"No."
18:29;18:30;"Oh, man."
18:30;18:37;"Yeah, there's a beautiful video of Pentangle doing a late '60s English TV recording."
18:37;18:38;"They sound so good."
18:38;18:40;"I watch that all the time."
18:40;18:43;"I believe that guy Bert Janch was in Pentangle, right?"
18:43;18:44;"Yes, right."
18:44;18:45;"Yeah."
18:45;18:47;"OK, and then he made some great records in the '70s."
18:47;18:56;"I saw Bert Janch play, opening for Neil Young in Connecticut with my brother."
18:56;18:57;"He played in Wallingford."
18:57;18:59;"I think it was Wallingford, Connecticut, a little theater."
18:59;19:02;"Was that the show that Joe Rogan worked security at?"
19:02;19:03;"No, that's Massachusetts."
19:03;19:05;"Do you remember that game?"
19:05;19:09;"Yes, Rogan worked security at Neil Young in 1990 or something."
19:09;19:10;"Yeah."
19:10;19:15;"Anyway, Bert Janch, he died a little bit, within a year of that show."
19:15;19:17;"It was awesome."
19:17;19:21;"Just like dense, heady, acoustic music."
19:21;19:23;"All this music, it has so much in common with Neil Young."
19:23;19:28;"It hits so different because he's got his Americana or Canadian Americana."
19:28;19:30;"But the drumming is so similar."
19:30;19:32;"That kind of simple--"
19:32;19:37;"This might be an interesting turn for us."
19:37;19:41;"Is that line, if we go back to Percy's song for a second,"
19:41;19:43;"the line, ""Oh, the cruel rain and the wind""?"
19:43;19:44;"Yeah."
19:44;19:49;"That's based on a traditional song, the Twa Sisters,"
19:49;19:52;"is one of the-- a bunch of different names that it's known."
19:52;19:58;"The other one is ""Wind and Rain,"" which Jerry Garcia did cover."
19:58;20:00;"Different from the ""Cold Rain and Snow."""
20:00;20:04;"Right, but if the song that they're talking about in Percy's song,"
20:04;20:06;"when he says there's a song in their head,"
20:06;20:09;"the rain and the wind, that is the specific song."
20:09;20:10;"That's a song."
20:10;20:11;"That's a specific song."
20:11;20:12;"Let's find that Jerry ""Wind and Rain."""
20:12;20:13;"So we have it here."
20:13;20:14;"""The Rain and the Wind""?"
20:14;20:16;"They're calling it ""Dreadful Wind and Rain,"""
20:16;20:18;"but it's the same traditional song."
20:18;20:19;"Oh, this is like Jerry acoustic."
20:19;20:25;"I've also been on a very heavy Jerry acoustic kick."
20:25;20:26;"Like live shows?"
20:26;20:27;"Yeah, I got this record."
20:27;20:29;"There's a Jerry acoustic version."
20:29;20:32;"Okay, let's check-- yeah, with David Grisman, the mandolinist."
20:32;20:34;"[laughs]"
20:34;20:36;"I thought it was my fault."
20:36;20:37;"No, I think it's my fault."
20:37;20:38;"Okay."
20:38;20:39;"[laughs]"
20:39;20:40;"My fault."
20:45;20:47;"So Linda and Richard, this is the song in their head."
20:47;20:51;"""There were two sisters game walking down the street,"
20:51;20:55;"oh, the wind and rain."
20:55;20:58;"The one behind pushed the other one in,"
20:58;21:00;"crying, oh, the dreadful wind and rain."""
21:00;21:02;"What year is this, you say?"
21:02;21:03;"This feels like a '90s recording."
21:03;21:06;"""Johnny gave the young just a gay gold ring,"
21:06;21:10;"oh, the wind and rain."
21:10;21:13;"Didn't give the oldest one anything,"
21:13;21:15;"crying, oh, the dreadful wind and rain."""
21:15;21:17;"Well, they did another band like Fairport,"
21:17;21:20;"where it's like the songs they write and the songs they cover,"
21:20;21:22;"you can't really tell."
21:22;21:24;"Like if you were like, ""Jerry wrote this,"" I'd be like, ""Okay."""
21:24;21:26;"Right, yeah."
21:26;21:29;"""Marched her as she floated down the river,"
21:29;21:31;"crying, oh, the dreadful wind and rain."""
21:31;21:32;"This is kind of dark."

21:33;21:39;"[playing guitar]"
21:39;21:44;"Murder Ballads, they're the original true crime podcast."
21:44;21:49;"Because you always find that era of Bob Dylan's Woody Guthrie's,"
21:49;21:51;"these people got obsessed with folk music,"
21:51;21:53;"they're always talking about murder ballads,"
21:53;21:59;"because that was such a classic pillar of the genre."
21:59;22:05;"So you could totally picture somebody pre-radio, pre-TV,"
22:05;22:08;"and just being at some group gathering or pub or something,"
22:08;22:10;"and say, ""Anybody got a good song?"""
22:10;22:12;"People probably did want to hear one with a story."
22:12;22:13;"You're on the edge of your seat."
22:13;22:14;"Right."
22:14;22:17;"Yeah, you could see people don't care that much."
22:17;22:18;"It's like quaint."
22:18;22:21;"I feel like Taylor Swift dropped a murder ballad a few years ago."
22:21;22:23;"They come out, people still like them,"
22:23;22:27;"but probably back then if you just picked a really generalized love song,"
22:27;22:29;"it probably wouldn't be quite as interesting."
22:29;22:31;"It's just you're really listening to it, and then what happened?"
22:31;22:33;"I'm picturing the bar in Banshee's of Inisheeran."
22:33;22:34;"Oh, yeah, totally."
22:34;22:37;"You know there's those scenes when they're kind of jamming at the bar?"
22:37;22:38;"Yeah, yeah."
22:38;22:39;"And I'm like, ""Give me more of that."""
22:39;22:40;"Oh, yeah, totally."
22:40;22:42;"And then just picturing someone coming out"
22:42;22:44;"and just dropping an eight-minute murder ballad."
22:44;22:45;"Yeah."
22:45;22:48;"I bet you could hear a pin drop in there."
22:48;22:52;"1920, rural Ireland bar."
22:52;22:54;"Yeah, and even further back."
22:54;22:56;"Yeah, 1820."
22:56;22:57;"Who knows?"
22:57;23:00;"Even 13th century medieval times."
23:00;23:04;"Yeah, because probably back then somebody would just roll up and--"
23:04;23:08;"even a great song like ""Take On Me"" by A-ha."
23:08;23:11;"Beautiful song, but I could see if you never heard it before"

23:55;23:58;"Right, and then you bust out Percy's song."
23:58;23:59;"Okay."
23:59;24:02;"Yeah, and I feel like that does happen in those movies."
24:02;24:05;"Famously in ""Black Knight"" with Martin Lawrence."
24:05;24:08;"I feel like at some point they start playing a modern song."
24:08;24:09;"Most famously, ""Back to the Future."""
24:09;24:10;"Sure."

29:26;29:28;"from where he was at."
29:28;29:29;"Oh, yeah."
29:29;29:31;"500 years ago. I just can't follow it."
29:31;29:32;"Of course you're not alone."
29:32;29:34;"Obviously, as a guy that created"
29:34;29:36;"all these classic plot archetypes,"
29:36;29:38;"you gotta give it up."
29:38;29:39;"Right."
29:39;29:41;"But if I see a production--"
29:41;29:42;"It's probably the same way you feel"
29:42;29:43;"about Woody Guthrie."
29:43;29:45;"A little bit. I'm not throwing on the Woody."
29:45;29:47;"I'm not throwing on Woody at the studio, man."
29:47;29:49;"What are your thoughts on the Baz Luhrmann"
29:49;29:50;"""Romeo and Juliet""?"
29:50;29:51;"You throwing that on?"
29:51;29:52;"Not a fan of Baz."
29:52;29:53;"Okay."
29:53;29:54;"Hannah's a big fan of that."
29:54;29:55;"Elvis?"
29:55;29:57;"Did you ever see Elvis?"
29:57;29:59;"A good chunk of it."
29:59;30:01;"Shout out to Austin Butler,"
30:01;30:02;"friend of the show, because--"
30:02;30:04;"Is he a friend of the show?"
30:04;30:05;"No, but we've talked about him."
30:05;30:06;"Oh, we have talked about him."
30:06;30:08;"I like you're like, ""Dude, did he call in?"""
30:08;30:10;"I could be led to believe he'd been on the show once."
30:10;30:12;"No, I mean, his performances."
30:12;30:13;"He's a great actor."
30:13;30:15;"The first scene where you see him play,"
30:15;30:18;"the movie really did viscerally represent"
30:18;30:20;"how shocking and exciting that music"
30:20;30:22;"would have been at the time"
30:22;30:24;"for the teen audiences."
30:24;30:25;"Yeah."
30:25;30:26;"Which is such a cliche that we've seen"
30:26;30:28;"so many times."
30:28;30:30;"So it is like a testament to the movie"
30:30;30:33;"that I kind of got excited watching"
30:33;30:35;"the musical portions."
30:35;30:37;"I just didn't like all the stylistic"
30:37;30:38;"kind of window dressing."
30:38;30:39;"Did you watch it?"
30:39;30:41;"I watched it, and yeah, it's insane,"
30:41;30:43;"but it's also kind of good."
30:43;30:44;"I want to get to the--"
30:44;30:46;"I should just go back to it"
30:46;30:49;"and get to the Elvis in Vegas period."
30:49;30:51;"My favorite Elvis period."
30:51;30:53;"Elvis crushed it in Vegas."
30:53;30:55;"I've watched the videos of him many times."
30:55;30:57;"They're super tight."
30:57;30:59;"Those shows would have been sick."
30:59;31:01;"And you got to sit down."
31:01;31:03;"It's kind of cool that there's a trend"
31:03;31:05;"back towards the--"
31:05;31:06;"Seated?"
31:06;31:07;"Well, actually, what's going on"
31:07;31:09;"at these residencies in Vegas"
31:09;31:13;"when you go see Katy Perry or Adele?"
31:13;31:15;"Are you seated and you're ordering"
31:15;31:18;"lobster Thermidor and stuff to your table?"
31:18;31:19;"No."
31:19;31:21;"But I think it's--but it's seated."
31:21;31:23;"Not table service."
31:23;31:25;"But seated the way an arena show is seated"
31:25;31:27;"and everybody stands up the whole time."
31:27;31:28;"A theater show."
31:28;31:30;"I mean, from anything I've seen in Vegas"
31:30;31:31;"and these shows, I think--"
31:31;31:32;"What have you seen?"
31:32;31:34;"Shania Twain or something?"
31:34;31:35;"Did you see Morrissey?"
31:35;31:36;"Saw Morrissey."
31:36;31:38;"That's at Caesar's Theater."
31:38;31:39;"Any of the elegant--"
31:39;31:41;"No, but that's not a residency."
31:41;31:42;"He was just on tour, right?"
31:42;31:43;"He did a couple days,"
31:43;31:44;"but the long residencies, I think,"
31:44;31:46;"are in theaters that are already built."
31:46;31:48;"That sort of coppa, whatever idea"
31:48;31:50;"that we have of the elegance of old--"
31:50;31:52;"you know, where everyone's at the tables."
31:52;31:53;"The 50s, like Copacabana."
31:53;31:54;"I just don't think--"
31:54;31:56;"Billy Rose's magic horseshoe."
31:56;31:59;"My guess is that it's to pack--"
31:59;32:00;"it's a numbers game."
32:00;32:02;"It's just to make as much money as possible"
32:02;32:03;"to make these affordable."
32:03;32:04;"In Vegas?"
32:04;32:05;"Yeah."
32:05;32:07;"[laughs]"
32:07;32:08;"No, but you know what I mean?"
32:08;32:10;"That there's this idea of having a table"
32:10;32:11;"where you got your six people"
32:11;32:12;"and then over there, it's like,"
32:12;32:13;"no, they've just packed it in."
32:13;32:14;"No, and that is what's funny."
32:14;32:16;"When you see the actual footage"
32:16;32:17;"of Elvis performing,"
32:17;32:20;"or even in the movie, the recreation,"
32:20;32:22;"there is something about watching"
32:22;32:25;"the biggest artist on the planet,"
32:25;32:28;"one of the most famous people on the planet,"
32:28;32:32;"performing, and rather than looking out"
32:32;32:35;"and just seeing a stadium or an arena,"
32:35;32:38;"you see some older people"
32:38;32:39;"just sitting at a table"
32:39;32:40;"with food in front of them."
32:40;32:41;"Yeah."
32:41;32:42;"Lobster."
32:42;32:44;"Yeah, The Weeknd's not doing that,"
32:44;32:47;"but it is such a better way to enjoy a show."
32:47;32:48;"Yeah, it also feels like--"
32:48;32:50;"You're packing way less bodies in the room."
32:50;32:51;"Yeah."
32:51;32:52;"I mean, I think we've talked about"
32:52;32:53;"going to the Usher residency."
32:53;32:54;"Yeah, that's probably just,"
32:54;32:56;"you're just standing up."
32:56;32:58;"Or you're seated in a theater,"
32:58;32:59;"but how great would it be if, yeah,"
32:59;33:01;"you were able to order a steak,"
33:01;33:03;"loaded potato, baked potato."
33:03;33:04;"Now I'm interested."
33:04;33:05;"And you're watching Usher."
33:05;33:06;"Yeah, see, also,"
33:06;33:08;"and the nature of the show is different,"
33:08;33:10;"because I've heard the Usher show is great,"
33:10;33:14;"but it's kind of like an arena-level spectacle"
33:14;33:15;"with dancing and stuff."
33:15;33:17;"I'm sure he's such a charismatic guy."
33:17;33:19;"I'm sure he probably talks to the audience"
33:19;33:21;"a little bit, but back then,"
33:21;33:23;"it probably was such a treat"
33:23;33:24;"that suddenly here you are."
33:24;33:26;"You got a fully loaded baked potato,"
33:26;33:28;"lobster steak in front of you."
33:28;33:31;"You're on your third martini with the missus."
33:31;33:32;"Hide of the empire."
33:32;33:33;"Having a great time."
33:33;33:34;"And Elvis is there,"
33:34;33:35;"and he's just kind of like looking around."
33:35;33:38;"He probably was making small talk with everybody."
33:38;33:39;"You know?"
33:39;33:40;"It's the same when you see--"
33:40;33:41;"It's intimate."
33:41;33:42;"It's the same when you see old pan and--"
33:42;33:43;"And I think also the lights were on, too."
33:43;33:44;"I get that impression, too."
33:44;33:45;"It wasn't that dark in the room."
33:45;33:46;"Bright room."
33:46;33:47;"Yeah, you know, you guys know,"
33:47;33:50;"I saw David Blaine in Vegas not so long ago."
33:50;33:51;"Great show."
33:51;33:52;"But if you had been at a table--"
33:52;33:53;"Amazing magician."
33:54;33:56;"I mean, truly magical."
33:56;33:58;"He would walk through the audience."
33:58;33:59;"But you're in little seats."
33:59;34:00;"You're in a stadium."
34:00;34:01;"It's a theater situation."
34:01;34:03;"He's going up and trying to do magic with you"
34:03;34:04;"and walk through the seating."
34:04;34:05;"And if you were at a table,"
34:05;34:07;"and he's walking through the tables"
34:07;34:08;"and able to talk to people."
34:08;34:09;"You know, when you see Sinatra,"
34:09;34:12;"and he walks down, he's able to lean in."
34:12;34:14;"Any of that magic's gone."
34:14;34:16;"Can you order a drink?"
34:16;34:17;"No, outside."
34:17;34:19;"You have to get up and go to the bar."
34:19;34:20;"Yeah."
34:20;34:21;"You know, it's the same thing when you see the old,"
34:21;34:23;"you know, how you used to fly."
34:23;34:26;"Pan Am, you know, where you'd see people at tables."
34:26;34:27;"Right."
34:27;34:29;"You know, and they're smoking a cigarette at a table."
34:29;34:30;"Right."
34:30;34:33;"With, you know, someone coming and bringing them a martini."
34:33;34:35;"Those tables became four chairs."
34:35;34:38;"Can you order martinis on planes still?"
34:38;34:39;"Like, if you're flying first class?"
34:39;34:40;"Do they have a--"
34:40;34:43;"I mean, obviously, you can order booze on a plane."
34:43;34:44;"They're not mixing any drinks for you."
34:44;34:47;"Even first class on a U.S. airline,"
34:47;34:49;"if they make you a martini,"
34:49;34:51;"you're definitely going to be drinking out of, like,"
34:51;34:53;"one of those little ridged plastic cups."
34:53;34:54;"Right."
34:54;34:56;"Delta does espresso martinis."
34:56;34:58;"Are you into those?"
34:58;34:59;"I'm not a martini guy."
34:59;35:01;"Oh."
35:01;35:02;"A little too hard for me."
35:02;35:05;"Doesn't an espresso martini count as, like, a legit martini,"
35:05;35:07;"or is that, like, a newfangled?"
35:07;35:09;"Sounds pretty newfangled."
35:09;35:11;"No, but some people are very into them."
35:11;35:13;"They really wake you up."
35:13;35:15;"Wow, this is a real soft show so far,"
35:15;35:18;"but covering some interesting stuff."
35:18;35:21;"Matt texted saying that the Percy song"
35:21;35:23;"was probably one of our best flights of fancy."
35:23;35:24;"Oh, good."
35:24;35:27;"Oh, yeah, no, I like the oasis in the bar."
35:27;35:30;"We went off the rails with the Vegas stuff, Matt, so just--"
35:30;35:32;"Hey, you know one thing that gave me pause?"
35:32;35:33;"Banshees?"
35:33;35:35;"That's set in 1920?"
35:35;35:36;"I think so."
35:36;35:37;"I thought that was modern day."
35:37;35:38;"Yes, we talked about this."
35:38;35:39;"Did we?"
35:39;35:40;"Oh, yeah, no, no."
35:40;35:42;"Multiple people have said that to me."
35:42;35:43;"That's what's cool about it."
35:43;35:45;"It feels contemporary or timeless."
35:45;35:47;"Timeless is a better way to put it."
35:47;35:49;"Oh, yeah, I think that's also because--"
35:49;35:52;"well, we'd have to ask a rural Irish person."
35:52;35:55;"I feel like not all the language was period."
35:55;35:58;"They would say a couple things that are just kind of like--"
35:58;35:59;"Well, they're referencing--"
35:59;36:01;"there's, like, an Irish Civil War happening,"
36:01;36:03;"and there's a few shots of the calendar,"
36:03;36:05;"and it says 1923 or something."
36:05;36:07;"I just Googled it. It's 1923."
36:07;36:09;"A hundred years ago just blows my mind."
36:09;36:10;"That's really cool."
36:10;36:13;"Until you see the calendar in Colin Farrell's house,"
36:13;36:14;"you don't realize."
36:14;36:16;"It is funny that multiple people have that feeling"
36:16;36:19;"because there's absolutely nothing that makes it present day."
36:19;36:21;"Yeah, it's kind of obvious when you think about it."
36:21;36:22;"Like the donkey."
36:22;36:24;"That must have been deliberate, I would think,"
36:24;36:26;"on the director's part."
36:26;36:28;"Or I think what Ezra was about to point out"
36:28;36:30;"was maybe our ignorance."
36:30;36:31;"You know, you watch this."
36:31;36:33;"You're looking at Ireland, and you're going,"
36:33;36:34;"""Oh, small town."
36:34;36:36;"They probably don't have Wi-Fi."
36:36;36:37;"They probably still use donkeys."""
36:37;36:39;"I mean, if you-- I'm watching that movie."
36:39;36:41;"If I'm watching that movie,"
36:41;36:43;"and I'm thinking it's 2023, I'm like,"
36:43;36:46;"""Of course they have Wi-Fi, and they have phones,"
36:46;36:49;"but, like, they're not on them in the pub."""
36:49;36:51;"No, they might be in the pub,"
36:51;36:54;"and they probably have, like, a digital jukebox"
36:54;36:56;"blasting Ariana Grande."
36:56;36:58;"Yes, in reality--"
36:58;37:00;"After the first 20 minutes of that movie,"
37:00;37:01;"they go into the pub."
37:01;37:03;"You think it's, you know--"
37:03;37:05;"and then they go in, and they play Ariana Grande"
37:05;37:07;"on the digital jukebox."

37:56;37:58;"There would've been a little more texting."
37:58;38:01;"I feel like their pub day started pretty early,"
38:01;38:03;"like at, like, two or three."
38:03;38:04;"Yeah, I think that's how it used to be."
38:04;38:07;"So they, like, work from, like, 5.30 to, like--"
38:07;38:10;"I feel like they were, like, settling in at the bar at, like, three."
38:10;38:12;"But then the night's over at, like, eight."
38:12;38:13;"Right."
38:13;38:14;"You're getting up at five."
38:14;38:15;"Then you wake up with the dawn."

38:16;38:18;"Yeah, but there would've been a lot more texting."
38:18;38:20;"If that took place in present day, they'd just be like--"
38:20;38:21;"""Bro, where you at?"""
38:21;38:24;"Yeah, Colin Farrell looking out at the sea,"
38:24;38:27;"and then just, like, overlaid on his face would be, like, the text."
38:27;38:30;"Just, like, him just, like, ""For real?"
38:30;38:32;"We're seriously not friends anymore?"""
38:32;38:33;"""Dude, are we good?"""

38:44;38:47;"It's an iPhone pic with, like, the finger chopped off."
38:47;38:49;"That's the reveal."
38:49;38:51;"Instead of passing each other on the trail"
38:51;38:54;"with his bloody stump dripping,"
38:54;38:56;"you just hear, like, ""Whoop."""
38:56;38:57;"[laughter]"
38:57;38:58;"""Whoosh."""
38:58;39:00;"That's a cool idea because so many people clearly--"
39:00;39:03;"there's a deep desire that ""Fancies of Innocent"""
39:03;39:05;"take place in modern day."
39:05;39:08;"What if we do a version of it where it's entirely on screens?"
39:08;39:09;"One of those movies."
39:09;39:12;"Oh, like, one of those, like, they're trying to find, like,"
39:12;39:13;"the daughter gets kidnapped or something?"
39:13;39:14;"Yeah, there's ones like that."
39:14;39:16;"I've seen some horror movies like that."
39:16;39:20;"And, yeah, nobody actually, like, lives together."
39:20;39:23;"A lot of it takes place in a Discord server."
39:23;39:26;"That's nice, the entire movie."
39:26;39:27;"Yeah."
39:27;39:29;"What's nice about that is it would be a much shorter film."
39:29;39:31;"It would be, like, a 20-minute film"
39:31;39:33;"because all the walking would be eliminated"
39:33;39:35;"and conversations would get, like, collapsed."
39:35;39:37;"Yeah, enough of these long--"
39:37;39:39;"and these shots of quaint little--"
39:39;39:41;"No beautiful landscapes."
39:41;39:43;"Don't need any of that."
39:43;39:44;"More efficient."
39:44;39:45;"That's a cool movie."
39:45;39:48;"It's about a friendship that falls apart"
39:48;39:50;"because one guy's self-harming,"
39:50;39:52;"and it's just called ""Discord."""

39:55;39:56;"In rural Ireland."
39:57;40:00;"Yeah, maybe they have a Discord server just for the island."
40:00;40:01;"Everybody gets on it."

50:51;50:53;"our memories will always hold dear."
50:53;50:55;"See, in both songs, they're just taking the most"
50:55;50:58;"hackneyed summer..."
50:58;51:00;"-Imagery? -Imagery."
51:00;51:01;"And they're not even differentiating."
51:01;51:03;"It's total hallmark."
51:03;51:05;"I like the line about the ducks."
51:05;51:08;"Yeah, I mean, Bob would say something about ducks."
51:08;51:11;"Okay, how about a Kendrick Lamar song about summer?"
51:11;51:13;"(laughter)"
51:13;51:17;"I'll die if he says ""forever more."""
51:17;51:20;"Can we add a little bit of nuance to it?"
51:20;51:22;"Like something that happens in the summer?"
51:22;51:24;"No, no, first, just to do--"
51:24;51:26;"-Keep it consistent. -Just to keep it consistent."
51:26;51:28;"-We're practicing science here. -All right, fair."
51:28;51:31;"This is a Kendrick Lamar song about summer."
51:31;51:34;"The sun is blazing, the block is hot."
51:34;51:36;"(laughter)"
51:36;51:39;"Summer's here, and we're living nonstop."
51:39;51:42;"Kids are playing in the fire hydrant,"
51:42;51:44;"barbecues, and the smell of the grill,"
51:44;51:45;"it's vibrant."
51:45;51:48;"It's a vibrant urban community."
51:48;51:50;"Actually, I could kind of hear the word ""vibrant"" in his voice."
51:50;51:53;"Sure, you'd say ""vibrant,"" but the computer is just like,"
51:53;51:54;"""This song is in a city."""
51:54;51:55;"And here's the chorus."
51:55;51:59;"""Summertime and the living's easy,"" quote."
51:59;52:00;"""Summertime and the living's easy,"
52:00;52:03;"""everybody's out here getting tipsy."
52:03;52:06;"""We take it slow, we take it easy,"
52:06;52:10;"""living life like it's always been breezy."""
52:10;52:14;"Verse two, ""Hit the beach, let your toes in the sand,"
52:14;52:17;"""got your girl by your side holding hands."
52:17;52:19;"""Listen to the waves, let them soothe your mind."
52:19;52:22;"""Sun kissed, feel like we're out of time."""
52:22;52:24;"There was something pretty subtle in there,"
52:24;52:28;"that specifically, ""I got your girl holding hands."""
52:28;52:30;"Well, but he might be talking about you."
52:30;52:32;"I don't know, that's like a pretty,"
52:32;52:33;"I don't know if it's Kendrick,"
52:33;52:35;"but that certainly feels like Drake."
52:35;52:36;"You think he's stealing your girl?"
52:36;52:37;"He's like, ""I stole your girl."""
52:37;52:38;"No, no, he's saying, 'cause he said,"
52:38;52:40;"""Hit the beach, let your toes in the sand,"
52:40;52:41;"""got your girl by your side holding hands."""
52:41;52:42;"Second Poe."
52:42;52:43;"Yeah, he's talking about you."
52:43;52:45;"He's talking about you and your wife, Nick."
52:45;52:46;"Toes in the sand."
52:46;52:48;"I guess I would say that this song,"
52:48;52:50;"their Kendrick Lamar song about summer,"
52:50;52:53;"is 10% more Kendrick Lamar than it is Bob Dylan,"
52:53;52:55;"if I had to compare them."
52:55;52:57;"And one thing's for sure, is like,"
52:57;52:59;"forget about Vampire, Bob Dylan and Kendrick Lamar,"
52:59;53:02;"you'd think they'd be able to figure something out"
53:02;53:04;"that would be a tiny bit surprising,"
53:04;53:07;"the way that those artists are a tiny bit surprising."
53:07;53:10;"Like, you know, that doesn't seem like"
53:10;53:12;"you need a supercomputer just to analyze"
53:12;53:14;"Bob Dylan lyrics and say, like,"
53:14;53:17;"he juxtaposes these types of images."
53:17;53:18;"That's part of what makes Bob,"
53:18;53:21;"he would use a folkism and then maybe have"
53:21;53:23;"a line or a word you wouldn't expect,"
53:23;53:26;"or Kendrick Lamar might use a word you wouldn't expect."
53:26;53:28;"There's none of that."
53:28;53:30;"Well, that's 'cause they're writing their songs"
53:30;53:33;"based on their personal idiosyncratic histories"
53:33;53:35;"and tastes, which the computer doesn't have."
53:35;53:38;"All it is doing is just, you know,"
53:38;53:40;"aggregating all of the text."
53:40;53:42;"And I have a feeling if we put in like other rappers,"
53:42;53:43;"well, first of all, I'm sure if we put in"
53:43;53:45;"Neil Young versus Bob Dylan's song about summer,"
53:45;53:46;"it's going to be not different."
53:46;53:49;"If we put in like Jay-Z's song about summer,"
53:49;53:51;"it's not going to be any different."
53:51;53:53;"This has me thinking though, I'm surprised"
53:53;53:56;"there's like no beach imagery that I can think of"
53:56;53:58;"in any Southern California rap."
53:58;54:01;"I'm sure it must happen, but considering"
54:01;54:04;"all those classic rappers are from Hawthorne,"
54:04;54:07;"Inglewood, Compton, Long Beach,"
54:07;54:10;"pretty close to the beach, all those towns."
54:10;54:11;"Can you think of one?"
54:11;54:14;"Dr. Dre references palm trees in..."
54:14;54:16;"Well, it's not the beach, palm trees."
54:16;54:18;"Oh, you want specific..."
54:18;54:22;"I'm saying specifically like a SoCal rap beach song."
54:22;54:25;"There's a lot of talk about Nobu in Malibu."
54:25;54:26;"Nobu in Malibu?"
54:26;54:28;"Which has a view of the beach."
54:28;54:29;"I was thinking like 90s..."
54:29;54:31;"But I'm saying that even has a view of the beach"
54:31;54:32;"and they're not talking about the beach."
54:32;54:34;"But also I think, yeah, I'm sure the answer"
54:34;54:36;"a lot of people would give is you're talking"
54:36;54:39;"about the world of NWA and what they were describing."
54:39;54:42;"And the beach probably felt like a..."
54:42;54:44;"Not an NWA record, but yeah."
54:44;54:45;"Maybe like a Warren G record."
54:45;54:48;"NWA, Straight Outta Compton is like the original"
54:48;54:50;"Southern California rap record."
54:50;54:51;"It's possible that those guys,"
54:51;54:52;"first of all, what they're talking about..."
54:52;54:53;"Check Left Off The Record."
54:53;54:57;"Could you look up an AI song about NWA song about the beach?"
54:57;55:00;"And who knows, maybe with everything going on"
55:00;55:01;"in their lives at that moment,"
55:01;55:02;"maybe they barely got to the beach."
55:02;55:03;"They weren't getting over there."
55:03;55:04;"I mean..."
55:04;55:05;"10 minute drive to the beach."
55:05;55:06;"Is it only 10 minutes?"
55:06;55:07;"I don't know."
55:07;55:08;"It depends where you are."
55:08;55:10;"It could have felt a world away with everything going on."
55:10;55:14;"Or maybe there was a song that their manager said..."
55:14;55:16;"Guys, Dr. Dre was like,"
55:16;55:19;"""We gotta have at least one fun at the beach song."""
55:19;55:20;"Come on, guys."
55:20;55:22;"You know, Paul Giamatti is like..."
55:22;55:23;"Yeah, Paul Giamatti."
55:23;55:24;"Come on, guys."
55:25;55:26;"You're the new beach boys."
55:26;55:30;"It's all about cops and violence and gang banging."
55:30;55:31;"Don't you ever take a day off?"
55:31;55:32;"It's only 10 minutes away."
55:32;55:34;"A Sunday afternoon with the family?"
55:34;55:36;"Man, you don't understand where we're from at all."
55:36;55:38;"You know, the other thing about..."
55:38;55:39;"You guys never go surfing?"
55:39;55:41;"What are you talking about?"
55:41;55:44;"You could be in Malibu in an hour."
55:44;55:46;"You guys..."
55:46;55:49;"You guys never been surfing?"
55:49;55:51;"I've never heard of..."
55:51;55:52;"Boogie boarding at least?"
55:52;55:54;"Boogie boarding."
55:54;55:56;"Just Ice Cube quietly raging."
55:56;55:59;"And he's just like, ""Come on, hear him out, man."""
55:59;56:01;"""Hear him out."""
56:01;56:04;"Can I add a bit of a twist just to keep this interesting?"
56:04;56:05;"Sure."
56:05;56:07;"I said write an NWA song about the summer,"
56:07;56:10;"but being mad that they have never had time to visit the beach."
56:10;56:11;"Okay."
56:11;56:12;"Just to give it some of that aggression."
56:12;56:13;"Sure, sure."
56:13;56:15;"Keep it consistent with their body of work."
56:15;56:16;"Okay, hang on a second."
56:16;56:17;"Is it writing it?"
56:17;56:19;"It's the Kendrick Lamar lyrics, though."
56:19;56:22;"""Summertime and the livin's easy"" is the first line here."
56:22;56:24;"Although, the one thing I'll say that it deserves some credit for"
56:24;56:28;"is that as it writes it out, it says, ""Verse 1, MC Ren,"""
56:28;56:29;"and then, ""Verse 2, EZ."""
56:29;56:31;"So at least it like--"
56:31;56:37;"So the computer can correctly name the members of a very famous historical group."
56:37;56:38;"I'm impressed."
56:38;56:40;"Okay, I'm just looking through it."
56:40;56:43;"It's pretty dumb, but okay."
56:43;56:45;"This Dr. Dre verse is kind of interesting."
56:45;56:47;"""I see the pictures, all my friends at the shore,"
56:47;56:50;"and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on more."
56:50;56:52;"The waves crashing, the sand between my toes,"
56:52;56:55;"but instead I'm stuck in the studio making flows."""
56:55;56:57;"That's kind of amazing."
56:57;56:58;"That's workaholic."
56:58;56:59;"This is Ice Cube's verse."
56:59;57:01;"""I'm sick of this hustle, I need a break."
57:01;57:03;"I want to hit the beach and feel the waves shake,"
57:03;57:06;"but until then I'll keep grinding and working hard"
57:06;57:09;"until I can finally let down my guard."""
57:09;57:10;"""Let down my guard."""
57:10;57:14;"I mean, even in that classic Ice Cube song, ""Today was a good day."""
57:14;57:15;"No beach."
57:16;57:17;"Didn't drop by the beach."
57:17;57:19;"I'm sure Ice Cube would probably give you--"
57:19;57:23;"he probably maybe didn't feel welcome at the beach in '90s LA."
57:23;57:25;"Does he say where he is in that song?"
57:25;57:28;"People have spent a lot of time trying to figure out the--"
57:28;57:29;"Well, the geography?"
57:29;57:31;"Somebody claims that they--"
57:31;57:32;"we ought to throw this on."
57:32;57:35;"We've never really--we're so classic rock oriented,"
57:35;57:38;"we don't talk enough about classic rap on this show."
57:44;57:47;"Were you loving this in the '90s when it came out, Jake?"
57:47;57:49;"Or did you not hear it that much because you were on the East Coast?"
57:49;57:50;"No, I heard it."
57:50;57:51;"Yeah, no, I dug it."
57:51;57:53;"I didn't love it initially, but then--I don't know."
57:53;57:56;"Within a few years, I dug it."
57:56;57:58;"Such a haunting beat."
57:58;58:00;"It had Doggystyle on tape."
58:00;58:01;"Oh, really?"
58:01;58:02;"Yeah."
58:02;58:04;"You showed some love to the West Coast?"
58:04;58:05;"Big time."
58:05;58:06;"Almost preferred West Coast rap."
58:06;58:07;"Really?"
58:07;58:08;"Yeah."
58:08;58:09;"Never was in the tribe."
58:09;58:10;"Wow."
58:11;58:12;"Jake, what about that--"
58:12;58:13;"No shots fired."
58:13;58:14;"I just--I don't know."
58:14;58:15;"I just--"
58:15;58:17;"What about that high-pitched synth sound that they always use?"
58:17;58:18;"Love that."
58:18;58:19;"Oh, really?"
58:19;58:20;"Well, I guess we've talked about this."
58:20;58:22;"Jake, born and raised in Connecticut, but always--"
58:22;58:23;"Spiritually West Coast."
58:25;58:27;"I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top"
58:27;58:31;"And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop"
58:31;58:33;"Had to stop at a red light"
58:33;58:36;"Looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight"
58:36;58:38;"And everything is alright"
58:38;58:40;"I got a beat from Kim"
58:40;58:42;"And she could do it all night"
58:42;58:45;"Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all"
58:45;58:48;"Which part are y'all playing basketball?"
58:48;58:51;"Get me on the court and I'm troubled"
58:51;58:53;"Last week, messed around and got a triple-double"
58:53;58:55;"Freaking brothers every day"
58:55;58:57;"Like it's just a game, buddy"
58:57;58:59;"To me, it's just a game"
59:01;59:13;"Drove to the pad and hit the showers"
59:13;59:16;"Didn't even get no static from the cowards"
59:16;59:19;"'Cause just yesterday, them booze tried to blast me"
59:19;59:23;"Saw the police and they rode right past me"
59:23;59:25;"No flexing, didn't even look in the mirror"
59:25;59:27;"He's a 26-minute drive from the closest beach"
59:27;59:29;"Yeah, that probably felt a world away"
59:29;59:31;"What are you saying his location is?"
59:31;59:33;"I just typed in South Central Los Angeles"
59:33;59:34;"Uh-huh"
59:34;59:37;"Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em"
59:37;59:39;"Roll 'em in a circle, our homies, and watch me break 'em"
59:39;59:45;"With a 7, 7-11, 7-11, 7-11 back door"
59:45;59:48;"Little jump, I picked up the cash from"
59:48;59:51;"Then we played balls, and I'm yelling domino"
59:51;59:55;"Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA"
59:55;59:58;"Today was a good day"
59:58;01:00:07;"That had a touch of record executive being like"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"""I gotta say, Cube, doesn't sound like that good of a day"""
01:00:10;01:00:15;"""You mean go to Universal Studios or?"""
01:00:15;01:00:19;"It's ironic, I had the booze, she had the chronic"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"The Lakers beat the Supersonics"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"See, I gotta remember there was some thing years ago"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"where somebody figured out what day"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Of course, it wasn't actually a day"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"He's just an artist painting a picture"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"But there was a day"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"There's only so many days in the early 90s"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"when the Lakers beat the Supersonics"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"and there was no smog"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"I think those are like the primary things"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"that helped that out"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"I miss the smog part"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Yeah, no smog"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Okay"
01:00:44;01:00:48;"I was glad everything had worked out"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"Dropped the vert off and then chirped out"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"Today was like one of those fine dreams"
01:00:53;01:00:57;"Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"No helicopter looking for the murder"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Two in the morning got the fat burger"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Got the fat burger"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"Even saw the lights of the Goodyear blitz"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"And it read ""Ice Cube's a pimp"""
01:01:07;01:01:09;"I always love that part"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"It is so amazingly simple"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"He's basically telling a pretty normal story"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"He wants a fat burger"
01:01:18;01:01:22;"And also, there's the emotional, sociopolitical element"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"No cops doing anything bad"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"Nobody got murdered"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"It's a mellow day"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"But in a way, it's very small and human"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"The small wins of living in a place like that"
01:01:34;01:01:37;"Dealing with life as Ice Cube in the early 90s"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"And then out of nowhere he looks up at the Goodyear blimp"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"And it says ""Ice Cube's a pimp"""
01:01:42;01:01:44;"Magic realism"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"It's pure magic realism"
01:01:47;01:01:57;"Hold up, Poop, stop this, man"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Yeah, and then the flight of fantasy was over"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"He couldn't just leave it"
01:02:00;01:02:05;"As this kind of nostalgic, dreamy, Proustian reverie"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"So basically at the end he's saying it didn't happen"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"He had to unplug"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"Actually, that is kind of dark"
01:02:11;01:02:15;"Especially, this album is famously a pretty hard album"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Ice Cube, The Predator"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"This is pure gangster rap"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Ice Cube, early 90s"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"Very angry"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Had left NWA"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"And this is one of the bigger hits"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"But it's this mellow song"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"And it is kind of funny"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Kind of funny, kind of sad"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"That it's this reverie"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"And it's almost like some Matrix thing"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Where he wakes up and he's like"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Man, I have a really stressful life"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"With the police and crime"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"And my feud with EZE"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"But I woke up today and actually everything's pretty good"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Look at that"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"No real smog today"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"Things are going pretty good"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Oh, mom didn't put any bacon in breakfast"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"That's good, I'm trying not to eat pigs"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"And then just walk around like"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Things are going pretty good"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Oh, I got a beep from Kim"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"That'll be fun"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"But something's not quite right"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Something's not quite right"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"But he's having such a good day"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"He doesn't really think about it too much"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"And then it is like the weird Truman Show moment"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Is actually when he looks up at the blimp"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"And it says Ice Cube is a pimp"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"And he's thinking, that's pretty cool"
01:03:10;01:03:13;"Wait, why would they say that on the Goodyear blimp?"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"And then he hears the alarm"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Beep, beep"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"And he's like, what?"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"He was in the Matrix"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"Spooky"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Just having a great dream"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Wait, actually, this makes me curious"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"On the album, what happens right after that song"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"I was just wondering that too"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"Peace, quiet, and good order"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Will be maintained in our city"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"To the best of our ability"
01:03:37;01:03:42;"Riots, melees, and disturbances of the peace"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"Are against the interest of all our people"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"And therefore cannot be permitted"
01:03:47;01:03:48;"This is probably from the 60s"
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Talking about"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"I've been told all along"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"That it's not not guilty"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"There's a series of fires"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"I'm not talking about Rodney King"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"And the things going on"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"In the disaster area, obviously"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"The jury found that they were all not guilty"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Make it rough"
01:04:01;01:04:05;"A lot of activity continues here in this cabaret"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Make it rough"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"We have sporadic fires"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"And guilty, not guilty, not guilty"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"I'm not saying it's not guilty"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty"
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Not guilty, the filthy"
01:04:11;01:04:12;"Devil's trying to kill me"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"When the news get to the hood"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"The brothers will be"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Hotter than cayenne pepper"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Cuss, bust, kicking up dust"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Is a must, I can't trust"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"A cracker in a blue uniform"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"Stick a brother like a unicorn"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Born wicked, Lawrence"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"Pow, foul, cut his damn throat"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"And I smile"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Go to Simi Valley"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"And surely somebody knows the address"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"Simi Valley, yeah, that's where all the cops live"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"And where they did the trial"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"Oh, right, yeah, that's where the, yeah, you're right"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"That provides quite a bit of context"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"He wakes up from the reverie of it was a good day"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"And immediately the news is on"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"Talking about riots"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"And the first line he says after"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Today was a good day"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"Not guilty, the filthy devil's trying to kill me"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"Back to reality"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"A little further number crunching"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"Reveals two songs that I found"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Where they talk about going to the beach"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Two rap songs, going to the beach"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"But interestingly, so there's going back to Cali"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Biggie's, going back to Cali"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"Where he talks about spending a week on Venice Beach"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"And then LL Cool"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Yeah, well, he's a tourist"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Well, that's what I was gonna say"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"But LL Cool J's, going back to Cali"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"Also spending time on the beach"
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Point being is that I think if you're here"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"Maybe you just don't even appreciate it"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"You know what I mean?"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"I mean, I don't go to the beach that often"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"But I also live, like, much farther away"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"Yeah, but again, I think the answer is like, you know"
01:05:31;01:05:35;"Living in this era, underserved community"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"It's not necessarily the most welcoming, easy thing"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"To go to the beach"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"But your colleague from New York flies in"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"They're going to the beach"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"I'm sure people went to the beach"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"It just doesn't fit into the image"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"That the albums are projecting"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"How often did MC Ren go to the beach growing up?"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"Yeah, MC Ren in like 1979"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"When he was a kid"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"How often does he go to the beach?"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"It's funny talking about 90s rap"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Because I did have an idea a while back"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"That we could talk about this song"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I just don't know how often we've talked about"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Big Pun"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Never"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"Now Jake, what do you think about Big Pun?"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Not a fan of East Coast rap?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"No opinion"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Do you know where he's from?"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"New York?"
01:06:12;01:06:13;"Yeah, what part of New York?"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Brooklyn?"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Nope"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Queens?"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Nope"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"Close"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"Bronx?"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Yes, Bronx"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"What about you, Seinfeld?"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"Do you a Big Pun fan?"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I used to love Big Pun"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"That Capital Punishment album is just like a straight"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"It's his one and only album"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"And you know, the thing about him"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Is that he died very young"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"He came out as this huge album"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"But then his friend and producer"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"And fellow rapper Fat Joe"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Went on to have a very illustrious career"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"But of course you remember this song"
01:06:41;01:06:46;"Oh, yeah"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"Yeah, I know this"
01:06:49;01:06:53;"This is Big Pun"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Yeah"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"I didn't know that"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Did you like this song?"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Love it"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Yeah, this is a great song"
01:06:58;01:07:02;"So this song is so huge"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"I even remember"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"So I was like 13, 14 when this came out"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Just like"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"Just being at like an awkward school dance"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"And then just like blasting this"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Since the birth of New Jersey"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Just kind of like"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"Great song"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Where did you pick this song?"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Okay, no, but I wasn't thinking about this song"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Everybody knows that song"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"There was another single from this album called Twins"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"Which was essentially a cover of"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre song"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Deep Cover"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"They took the same beat"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"And they wanted to do a similar"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Kind of like gangster storytelling thing"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Anyway, I was just thinking about this because"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"I was having a conversation"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"And a lyric from this popped into my head"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"And I wondered"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"We do talk about lyrics on this show a lot"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Of course, as you know, we always veer to classic rock"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"But this is a very classic line"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"And I thought it's worth discussing on the show"
01:07:53;01:07:59;"Does the beat sound familiar?"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"Because before this it was also Deep Cover"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"Deep Cover"
01:08:02;01:08:09;"So it's him and the beat"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"It's definitely familiar"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"I don't know if I know this song though"
01:08:11;01:08:18;"This is the classic line coming up"
01:08:18;01:08:25;"You guys know that line?"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"It's incredible, yeah"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"No, what's that line from?"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"It's, no, no, it's from this song"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"I'm just saying this is like"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"Maybe, I don't know"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I feel like maybe just like some of my"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"New York friends have always talked about like"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"That was a legendary line"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Or at least a famous line"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"Because of the really extreme wordplay"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"In Montreal, are people talking about that line, Seinfeld?"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"This is a legendary lyric"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"The internal rhyme is"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"That in the middle of little, little, little"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Did we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"Here to be a cold day in Ravendale"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"And actually in the video, it does"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"There's like a close up"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"There's a close up of his mouth"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"Because it is kind of legendary"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"And then I was like looking it up"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"And on Genius they had like a quote"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"From Fat Joe who basically said"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"That Big Pun was such a wordsmith"
01:09:13;01:09:14;"He was always coming up with"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"These crazy tongue twisters like that"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"And that because this song"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Takes place in Little Italy"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"Probably Bronx, Little Italy"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Not Manhattan, Little Italy"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"That Joe said to him"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"Oh you gotta do that crazy tongue twister rap"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"And that Pun said"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"No, no, no, come on"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"That's like a joke"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"And he said no, no, no"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"It's incredible"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"And he said people are going to make fun of me"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"It's so stupid"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"And that Fat Joe being a great producer"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Was like no, no, you gotta put it in"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"And convinced him to"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"I wonder why he thought it was stupid"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"It's like over the top"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Yeah, it's over the top"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"And it does, you know"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"There is a way in which it just sounds like"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Diddly"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Maybe not the coolest word"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Diddly"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"I do kind of love it"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"And then I can't help but"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"It's dead in the middle of Little Italy"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"DWLP5"
01:10:05;01:10:09;"Yeah, I should do a tribute to Big Pun"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"Album title?"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"Yeah, album title"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"Just diddly"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Where'd you come up with that?"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"It's a tribute to deceased rapper Big Pun"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"I think the reason I thought of this is because"
01:10:18;01:10:22;"I randomly said something about being in the middle of Little Italy"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"And then just like instantly took me back to this"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"But it's dead in the middle of Little Italy"
01:10:27;01:10:31;"Little did we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"So not only is it like a tongue twister"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"But he's really like telling the story here"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Because in the beginning"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Didn't do diddly"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Diddly squat"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"He said, he basically"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"They were hired by some dirty cops"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"That were gonna help"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"He says that'll get us in"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I don't know if that means like get them in with like the"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"The police organization or help them somehow"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Give them money"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"But some dirty cops"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Asked them to go kill somebody"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"So this is a real murder ballad"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Oh this is a murder ballad"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"Yeah, okay, it comes full circle"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"So these dirty cops hired"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"Big Pun and Fat Joe to go kill some Italians"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"I'm just picturing Michael Rappaport"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Oh he's a dirty cop"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"Yeah"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"No totally, somebody could make a"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I wonder if one day there will be a movie"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"Just called Dead in the Middle of Little"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"Dead in the Middle of Little Italy"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"That almost seems like something could happen"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"That could happen"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Netflix presents an eight part mini series"
01:11:24;01:11:27;"Based on this one big pun line"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"Just an egregious Scorsese rip off"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah that'd be cool"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"It could be Scorsese's next movie"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"So then they hop in the Hummer"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"The Punisher's ready"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"He's the Punisher"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"And then he says meet me at Vito's with noodles"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"We'll do this dude while he's slurping spaghetti"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"I think in The Godfather"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Doesn't that iconic scene in the bathroom"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"Take place in the Bronx?"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"That does ring true"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"Yeah, it'd be a Coppola film"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"So then they go in"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"They start yelling at everybody"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Presumably they kill a bunch of people"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"And then he says"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"I guess the cops told him to kill these guys"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"And who knows, maybe Michael Rappaport was like"
01:12:11;01:12:15;"Guys, these are some bad dudes"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"Rappaport owed those guys like 50 grand for gambling"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"Right"
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Yeah, right, and he spins it"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"And he's like"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"You know I'm a cop"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"You know what I could do to you?"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"But I'm telling you"
01:12:24;01:12:25;"I'll be your friend"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"You kill this guy who's a really bad guy"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"I'll give you 50k"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Turns out he was lying through his teeth"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"He owed these middle men something"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"They didn't do anything bad"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"And now it's going to be pinned on Big Pun and Fat Joe"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"So it is pretty impressive that it's like"
01:12:40;01:12:44;"Insane wordplay that somehow tells the story"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"It sometimes just gets stuck in my head"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"Little do we know that we"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"It's like a children's limerick"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"I can almost do like Micro Machine Guy"
01:13:01;01:13:02;"Oh, Micro Machine Guy"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Hold on"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"He does it about this"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"(singing)"
01:13:16;01:13:17;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"That's about how fast he does it"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"This is starting to sound like Primus"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"(laughing)"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"Actually this would be a great Primus cover"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"(singing)"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"Now dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Dead in the middle of little Italy"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Little do we know that we riddled some middle men"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"Who didn't do diddly"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"Let's do it again"
01:13:47;01:13:52;"(singing)"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Every word does make sense"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"Like on the one hand you're like"
01:13:54;01:13:55;"We riddled some middle men"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"Yeah"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"They were riddled with bullets"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Also the worst kind of"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"Well you followed the logic"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"And also the worst kind of middle man"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Would be the one that didn't do anything"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"That didn't do diddly"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"Yeah like you're thinking"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"We're about to get paid 500k"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"We took out a mob boss"
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Like what are you talking about?"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"These guys were just middle men"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"They were nobodies"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"But they were bad guys"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Nah"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"They were taking some action on the side"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"Big Punisher"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"These guys didn't do diddly"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"Whoa!"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Diddly?"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"You're telling me they didn't do diddly?"
01:14:23;01:14:24;"Diddly"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"They didn't do squat"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"They didn't"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"They didn't?"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"It's like a Killer Brothers movie at that point"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"They didn't"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"They didn't do diddly"
01:14:32;01:14:33;"They didn't do squat"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"They didn't do diddly or squat"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Okay"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"It's time for the top 5"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"It's time for the top 5"
01:14:40;01:14:44;"5 on iTunes"
01:14:44;01:14:50;"This week we'll be comparing the top 5 iTunes songs of today"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"With the top 5 songs this week in 1990"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Very weird year"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"I've always considered 1990 a really weird year"
01:14:57;01:15:00;"Why do you think 1990 is a weird year Jake?"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"You were kind of more"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"Let's see"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"You were 13"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"I was tapped in"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Yes you were more tapped in than I was"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"I was very tapped in on MTV in 1990"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Which was a funny time to be like"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Obsessively watching MTV"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"So even as a 13 year old you're like"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"This is neither here nor there"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Nirvana hasn't arrived yet"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"But the hair metal era feels tapped out"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"What's going on?"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"Yeah I mean"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Who's big?"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"Like Slaughter"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"And like"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"I mean yeah"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"It was still hair metal"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"But it felt"
01:15:25;01:15:29;"They were still rolling out singles from the Dr. Feelgood album"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"Motley Crue"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"And maybe some Poison"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"In 1990"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"Very innocuous pop"
01:15:34;01:15:37;"Were you aware of like the Pixies and Sonic Youth"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"No"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"No not at all"
01:15:39;01:15:43;"I was not aware of any kind of underground cool music"
01:15:43;01:15:47;"In 1990 were you aware of the band Bad English?"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"I think so"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"I think I'm looking at this now"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"And I'm like that rings a bell"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"It was a super group"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"That formed in '87 and featured"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Journey's keyboardist Jonathan Cain"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Guitarist Neil Schon"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"Schon"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"And drummer Dean Castronova"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"As well as vocalist John Waite of the Babies"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"And Ricky Phillips of Styx"
01:16:06;01:16:10;"This is Price of Love"
01:16:10;01:16:13;"I'll be curious if I"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"If this like"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Stirs a deep memory within"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Because I probably haven't heard it since"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Cain takes you right back"
01:16:21;01:16:28;"I do love these hair metal ballads"
01:16:28;01:16:37;"Girl"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"Sometimes it seems to me"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Okay"
01:16:41;01:16:45;"That I don't say the things I should"
01:16:45;01:16:49;"To you I act like I'm no good"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"And you"
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Who wrote the lyrics?"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Jetman EP 2"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Wait for me"
01:16:55;01:17:00;"This house is not a home without you"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"It takes two hearts to show"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"I like the chords"
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Your eyes will always see through me"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"And bring me to my knees"
01:17:09;01:17:13;"And I will always turn to you"
01:17:13;01:17:17;"You're everything I need"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"And through the good and bad times"
01:17:20;01:17:24;"You have always been there"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"We hold each other close"
01:17:27;01:17:31;"You're the sand between our toes"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"The nights we fight about it"
01:17:34;01:17:39;"Never dream of giving up"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"I feel like they're trying to write a Peter Sotero song"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Yeah but it's just not, not hitting"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"That's the price of love"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"I just feel bad, it's just like"
01:17:48;01:17:52;"Listening to a hit song from 1990 as if it's like a demo tape"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Just like, sorry fellas"
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Yeah"
01:17:55;01:17:56;"You don't have it"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"It's not gelling quite yet"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Yeah, I would go work on"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"Guys my advice"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"Too many chord changes"
01:18:01;01:18:06;"My advice, go re-simplify the song, re-work on the lyrics a bit"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"It's also funny this era"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"It sounds like a demo tape"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Yeah"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"We can see what you're going for"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"Like kind of a Peter Sotero thing"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"But really listen to his greatest songs"
01:18:16;01:18:20;"There's a level of craft that you guys are missing"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"So this is something funny about this era"
01:18:21;01:18:24;"Where there are all these like supergroups"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Because when you think of a supergroup"
01:18:25;01:18:28;"You imagine just like a group of people from bands"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"That either just like love playing so much"
01:18:30;01:18:34;"And want to do something maybe really technical they can't do"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"Or just something unique that their skills bring together"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"And this picture like all these dudes come together"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"Let's do something together"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"And they're just like yeah"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"Let's try like a middle of the road power ballad"
01:18:44;01:18:49;"Yeah, this feels like a very contrived project"
01:18:49;01:18:53;"A lot of A&R guys with a lot of flop sweat"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Getting this project together"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Yeah"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"Actually I don't remember that song"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"Because I probably at age 13 if that came out"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"I was probably like this sucks"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"Right"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"I'm changing the channel"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"I'll cruise back to MTV in a little bit"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"The number 5 song on"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"We're going back to the iTunes chart this week"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Just so people understand"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"iTunes chart is a little different than Apple Music"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Sometimes Apple Music because if like a big album comes out"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"It's all one artist"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"Right, right"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"Sometimes you get a little more variety"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"When we look at the iTunes chart"
01:19:19;01:19:23;"For the people who still buy songs on iTunes"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"We salute you"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"This is Lady Gaga with Hold My Hand"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"From the great film Top Gun Maverick"
01:19:28;01:19:39;"Hold my hand"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Is this the one that she did at the Oscars?"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"I miss that part of the Oscars"
01:19:43;01:19:47;"It lost to Not Too Not Too from RRR"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Have any of you guys seen that movie?"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Not yet"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"I've seen most of it"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"It's a long one"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"It's long, it rules"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Yeah, it's great"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Never quite seen anything like it"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Yeah, it's cool"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"It's the best of all types of action movies together"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"In a very unique package"
01:20:04;01:20:15;"I caught this part of the Oscars actually"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"And it was sort of like a stripped down"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"She even said at the beginning"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"She's like we're doing kind of like a"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"A basement rock"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Kind of performance here"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Okay"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"She's just wearing like a black t-shirt"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"No makeup"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Close up shot of her face"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"Kind of like Ally from Stars Born"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"Yeah"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"Which is my favorite Gaga"
01:20:34;01:20:35;"I thought it was great"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"It's pretty funny"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"This song has 1990 energy"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"It does have 1990 energy"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"Didn't Blood Pop produce this?"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Who's Blood Pop?"
01:20:45;01:20:49;"Blood Pop is a legendary producer"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"He's well known for working with Lady Gaga"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"The first thing that was like"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"He kind of came up with grimes"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"In that universe"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"But the thing he's probably best known for is the"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"Justin Bieber song Sorry"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"He's worked with everybody"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"We've worked together"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"What did you guys work on?"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Was he on Father of the Bride?"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Yeah, he's on Father of the Bride a little bit"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"What song?"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"He"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Some of the deeper cuts"
01:21:13;01:21:16;"Like we started"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"I think a somewhat slept on song on that album"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"Although there are a lot of songs"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"If I could call it a deep cut"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"He worked with you on Neo Yokio"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"On"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"What is it? Friend Like You?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Oh right!"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"I forgot about that"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Yeah, yeah"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"So he helped out with that"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"He's also just like a"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Very smart, interesting guy"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"What do you think the slept on songs"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"On Father of the Bride are?"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Okay"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"What's the Chet Bakery one?"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"That one popped into my head"
01:21:42;01:21:43;"Oh, my mistake"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Yes"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"That one popped into my head"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"A week or two ago"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"That's exactly the type of slept on one"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Because I feel like"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"That one"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"You know"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Because that one's kind of like a genre-y"
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Like Chet Baker"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Kind of throwback"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"I feel like people are kind of like"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Eh, you know like"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"It's not like a classic vampire ballad"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"Nor is it like a high energy song"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"And it's pretty like washy"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"It's washy and weird"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"And"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"But I felt even more"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"I always liked that song"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"I felt even more confident"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"When we started playing it live"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Because we did like kind of a cool arrangement"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Without all like the weird sounds"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"And"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"I remember even getting a few like messages"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Or some reviews"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Or people were like"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"What song actually really stood out?"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"My mistake"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"It's a little like jazzy moment"
01:22:24;01:22:25;"One song that I think is"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Was slept on is Spring Snow"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"It's another like vibey little ballad"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Deep in the album"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"So like understandably"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Third to last"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Yeah, yeah"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Way towards the end"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"And I think naturally"
01:22:36;01:22:39;"Those are the types of songs that are like"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"Fall by the wayside"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"Because they're like slow"
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Like I meet people who like"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Love like Rich Man"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Which is like kind of another short weird song"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"But you know even that's like"
01:22:48;01:22:49;"That stands out maybe"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"On first listen compared to"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"The lyric"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"Yeah, the lyrics"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"And it's like a little more energy"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Number four"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Back to 1990"
01:22:57;01:22:58;"Taylor Dane"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"Love Will Lead You Back"
01:23:00;01:23:03;"Love will lead you back"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"So 1990"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Yeah, 1990 is very weird"
01:23:06;01:23:10;"Very liminal spaces"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"Wow, weird album title"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"Can't Fight"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Oh"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"Can't Fight Fate"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"I thought it said"
01:23:17;01:23:18;"Hate"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"I was like, ""Dang it"""
01:23:20;01:23:21;"You can't fight hate"
01:23:21;01:23:22;"1990 was weird"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Yeah"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Okay, Can't Fight Hate"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"Can't Fight Hate"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Saying goodbye"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Is never a need"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Who's Diane Warren?"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"She's the songwriter"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Yeah, she was like at the Oscars"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Because she's written so many huge songs"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Right"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"I mean she wrote this song"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Oh, she had Whitney Houston in mind"
01:23:39;01:23:43;"But darling I set you free"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"But I know in time"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"We'll be together"
01:23:50;01:23:54;"I will try"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"To stop you now from leaving"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"This is so 90"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Like just ballads"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"Yeah"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"So far two power ballads"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Love will lead you back"
01:24:05;01:24:08;"I definitely remember watching this on MTV in 1990"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"In like four in the afternoon"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"And just being so depressed"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"It is depressing"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"This also just feels so like"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"This is Eileen's car to the full extent"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"Yeah, and I can just totally picture like"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Working at an office"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"In an office building in 1990"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"It's like working at like a dentist's office"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"You're the receptionist"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Just like zoning out"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"This is playing"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"You get in your car, it's playing"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"It's still playing"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"You stop off at the CVS to get your"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"Prescription, it's playing there"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"You stop home off at the grocery store"
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Right, it's still playing"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"Still playing"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"Love will lead you back"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"You get home"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"You put it on"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Yeah"
01:24:45;01:24:48;"Then you drive down to the Coconut's"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"Say, you guys have the new Taylor Dance CD?"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Purchase it for"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"1990, what do you think?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"1099?"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Oh, CD or tape?"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"Oh, I was thinking CD"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"Yeah, what would tape be?"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"799?"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"Yeah"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"You going for a nightcap later?"
01:25:06;01:25:07;"It's Love Will Lead You Back"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Playing at the bar"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Bar's empty"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"It's also a depressing concept"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"Because I think she's basically saying"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Alright, you want to leave?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Go ahead, leave"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"But love will lead you back"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"You're going to come back to my arms"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"You're not going anywhere"
01:25:20;01:25:21;"And I'm sure"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"I'm sure as the stars are shining"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"One day you'll find me again"
01:25:23;01:25:24;"It won't be long"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"You sure about that, Taylor?"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"Sure about that?"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"Won't be long?"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Alright"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"There's other fish in the sea"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"Yeah, let's not"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"Let's don't wait too long for this guy"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Okay"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"The number four song this week"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"Back on the iTunes chart of 2023"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"Morgan Wallen with Last Night"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Think it's going to be a Strokes cover?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Last night"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Last night she said"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Picturing again"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Just going back to medieval times"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Last night she said"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Grabbing the guitar"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Oh yeah"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"I got a song"
01:25:58;01:26:02;"Last night she said"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Baby don't"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Baby don't you feel so bad"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"When you put me down"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"People at the pub just like"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"What the f*** are you talking about?"
01:26:11;01:26:12;"Speaking of Strokes covers"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"Yeah"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"We saw one this weekend"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"Oh that's true"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"We didn't talk about this earlier"
01:26:16;01:26:17;"But Nick and I went to the"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Indian Wells"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Tennis tournament"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"I wanted to say conference"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"It's a conference too"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"So we're checking out"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"Some of the matches"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Learning about"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Who plays tennis these days"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Cause that's not Andre Agassi anymore"
01:26:33;01:26:34;"I'll tell you that much"
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Not even Federer"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"And Djokovic wasn't even allowed to play"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"So"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"We caught a lot of these younger cats"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"But"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"We're sitting there watching"
01:26:43;01:26:44;"This match"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"And then up on the screen it says"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Don't forget at 4.30"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"Catch the Johnny Smith Band"
01:26:50;01:26:51;"And again this is a tennis tournament"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"But then you look"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"And it's a picture of John McEnroe"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"And his wife is Patti Smith"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Not that one"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Right"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"The other one"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"So he called himself the Johnny Smith Band"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"So then later we walk over"
01:27:01;01:27:02;"And he's playing"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"For like"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"You know"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"I would say like maybe a thousand people"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Easily"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"That's"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"Easily?"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Wait in the arena?"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"No it's kind of like"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Over where people like buy drinks"
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Okay"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"They set up a little stage"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"It wasn't a main attraction"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"No cause there's constant"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"Playing happening"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"Okay"
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Right so people are going between different"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"Courts"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Yeah because"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"And there's a huge like"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"Food court area"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"And"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"A lot of people hanging out"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Yeah"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Certainly hundreds of people watching"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"And he's up there with his band"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Just ripping covers"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"And I don't know what I expected him to cover"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"But as we walked up"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"I just hear"
01:27:38;01:27:43;"(Humming)"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"And just like a truly wild"
01:27:45;01:27:48;"Raucous messy cover of The Strokes' Reptilia"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Wow"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"Sixty something year old John McEnroe"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"And then at the end he was just like"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Love The Strokes"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"I mean it makes sense cause then later he played"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Let The Good Times Roll by The Cars"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"And he was just like"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"I loved this band growing up"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"And then of course in my number crunch head"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"I'm thinking like"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"I mean you weren't growing up when The Cars were out"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"You were in your twenties"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Well"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"I guess when you're in your sixties"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"You're still growing up"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Yeah I don't know"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Growing up"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Yeah I may be halfway there"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"At my age"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I still think a little bit"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Someone's talking to me like"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Yeah you know when I was growing up"
01:28:19;01:28:22;"I'd think about like being eight"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"But fair enough you're in your sixties"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"What year was McEnroe born?"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"Can I get a real number crunch?"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"So John McEnroe"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"Was born in 1959"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"February 16th"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"He's 64"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Oh okay"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"He's a little"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Slightly younger than I thought"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"So he would have been"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Cars came out like '79"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"He's 20"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Yeah"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Okay fair enough"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Although"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Yeah I guess I don't know"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"Maybe if I was talking to a"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"To a child"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"When I was 20"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"It was 2004"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"What came out in 2004?"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"The Killers first album"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"White Stripes or something?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"Yeah"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"I definitely wouldn't say to somebody"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Oh yeah"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"When I was growing up"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"There was this band The Killers"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"And they came out"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"And we said okay"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"This song called Mr. Brightside"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"I didn't know it was gonna be a big song"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"I thought it was a good song"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"I didn't know it was gonna be a big song"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"But you know when I was growing up"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"We had bands like The Killers"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"White Stripes"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"Yeah it's funny"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"For me when I was growing up"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Was still"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"I just pictured being a kid"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"I was like when I was growing up"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Was like the"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"The 90s"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"By the time I was 20"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Anyway"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"When I was growing up"
01:29:22;01:29:23;"It was you know Taylor Dayne and"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"Right"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"Wait"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"Cause you were born in '77"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"Yeah"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"So you were"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"When I was growing up"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"It was like G&R"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Yeah no exactly"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"So imagine if"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Mali Crew then Nirvana"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"What bands came out in like"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"The late 90s"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Like '97"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Spice Girls"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Third Eye Blind"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"Yeah so if Jake ever was"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"Out there"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"You're playing"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Oh look what I'm playing"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Yeah I'm just saying"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"You're out there playing"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Richard Pictures"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"And you say you know guys"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"We're mostly known as"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"The Grateful Dead cover band"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"But this is a song I always really liked"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"From when I was growing up"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Here's a Third Eye Blind with"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"I Wish You Would Step Back"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"From That Ledge My Friend"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"I'd be like what do you mean growing up"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"You're in college"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"We're splitting hairs"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"But anyway"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"These are things that I was thinking"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"As I watched John Maxon Rose"
01:30:07;01:30:08;"So how was the cover?"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"What else did he do?"
01:30:10;01:30:11;"Alright here's his set list"
01:30:11;01:30:12;"He's got the set list"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"Set list FM"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"Alright so he opened with"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Jumping Jack Flash"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Okay"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Missed that one"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"I mean that's what I would have guessed"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Is this a power trio?"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I think there was"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Four?"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"No there were at least four people on stage"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"And I think he brought his daughter out"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"To sing at some point"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"But yeah the core crew was four"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"And then he goes into"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Just Like Heaven The Cure"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"I wish I caught that"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Okay"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Glory Days"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Okay that's exactly what I'm expecting"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"Glory Days"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"By Bruce"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Yeah by Bruce"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Glory Days"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Slides into"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"Beds Are Burning"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"Midnight Oil"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"So he has a taste for like"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Kind of alternative indie rock"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Yeah"
01:30:51;01:30:52;"He did Plush Stone Tone"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"STP"
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Oh wow"
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Okay Curveball"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"And by the way he goes"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"So much depends"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"And he goes from STP into the Strokes"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"So we just missed Plush"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"I like that"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"And then he goes into"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"Let The Good Times Roll"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"And then"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"That sounded pretty good"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Cause Reptilia was like"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"And also by the way"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"I just also wanted to say"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"He did have a sense of humor"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"He was kind of like"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Guys we're up here having fun basically"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"And then like he broke a guitar string"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"And he's like any questions"
01:31:18;01:31:19;"And he's kind of like"
01:31:19;01:31:20;"Razzing the audience a bit"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"He was good natured"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"And he goes from"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Let The Good Times Roll"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"And you'll remember this"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"He goes into this song"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"And it says unknown here"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Whoever, they couldn't pinpoint it either"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"It sounded like Johnny B. Goode"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"But it had like"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Jonathan Richman type vocals"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"Very different vocals and weird lyrics"
01:31:37;01:31:38;"They didn't know what it was?"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"And they didn't know what it was either"
01:31:39;01:31:40;"Oh maybe it was an original"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"And then Walking on Sunshine"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"Katrina and the Wave"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Wait that was his daughter came out for that?"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"Yeah"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"And then that's sort of when we left"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"And then we missed Bad Reputation"
01:31:48;01:31:49;"Joan Jett"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"That's exactly what I would have expected"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"This is pretty interesting"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"And he goes"
01:31:53;01:31:54;"He probably relates to that song"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"I don't give a damn about my bad reputation"
01:31:56;01:31:57;"Yeah"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"I mean that sort of seems like"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"In the movie"
01:31:59;01:32:00;"That's what he's walking out to"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"Oh yeah totally"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"You could just"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"I mean they probably"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"Didn't they literally make this movie?"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"Which is Shia LaBeouf"
01:32:05;01:32:06;"No I just pictured"
01:32:06;01:32:07;"I told you"
01:32:07;01:32:08;"That's a good movie"
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Yeah right"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"It's like somebody plays"
01:32:10;01:32:11;"Becker"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"Somebody plays Boris Becker"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Or whatever"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"Yeah that is a cool movie"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"It is"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"It's a weird vibey movie"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"And then it's just like"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Everybody's like"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"McEnroe's coming"
01:32:19;01:32:20;"Like Shia LaBeouf walks out"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"I don't give a damn about my bad reputation"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"Yeah"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"And then"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"So he goes from Joan Jett"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"Into Go With the Flow"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"Queens of the Stone Age"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"Okay"
01:32:28;01:32:29;"And then into"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"And he ends"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"With the Foo Fighters Learn to Fly"
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Okay"
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Wow"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"It's really covering this"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"And he's covering a lot of ground"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"Yeah spanning some eras"
01:32:38;01:32:39;"I mean I guess it does make"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"The Plush one is so real"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"Bummed"
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Left turn there"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"One time Richard Pictures did"
01:32:46;01:32:47;"At the pub"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"We did Althea into Plush"
01:32:49;01:32:50;"Back into Althea"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"Whoa"
01:32:51;01:32:52;"Yeah"
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Is there a tape?"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"I don't think so"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"But anyway"
01:32:56;01:32:57;"People were loving it"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"It was a great vibe"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Sounds awesome"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"Yeah they weren't taking themselves too seriously"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"Anyway"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"Here's Morgan Wallen"
01:33:03;01:33:04;"With his"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"His take on the strokes"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"Sorry I have to just interrupt that"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Uh"
01:33:08;01:33:09;"Eddie Van Halen"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"And Eric Clapton"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"Taught McEnroe to play guitar"
01:33:12;01:33:13;"Really?"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"According to McEnroe"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Interesting"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"That's so funny"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"What does that even mean?"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"I mean yeah"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"They sat down for 40 minutes once"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"And like hey"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"He paid them for lessons?"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"I don't know"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"He paid them?"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"I was"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"When he was growing up"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"I brought"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"When he was just growing up"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"We were just like doing an interview"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Like I can just picture this"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"It's like so random"
01:33:33;01:33:34;"This is John McEnroe"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"Sits down with Larry King"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"I understand you got a band"
01:33:37;01:33:38;"Oh that's right"
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Who taught you to play guitar?"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Eddie Van Halen"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"And Eric Clapton"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Pretty impressive"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Yeah"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"They're my friends"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Yeah how many lessons were they like"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"So did you pay them?"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Right"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Are you buying 10 lessons at a time?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"Maybe it was like a master class situation"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"Like an online"
01:33:55;01:33:59;"Between 1995 and 2000"
01:33:59;01:34:02;"Eddie Van Halen was giving him weekly lessons"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"He actually toured with Van Halen as a roadie"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"Okay here's Morgan Wallen"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"With his cover of The Strokes ""Last Night"""
01:34:11;01:34:14;"Okay actually"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"I don't think it's a cover"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Last night we let the liquor talk"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"I can't remember everything we said"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"But we said it all"
01:34:29;01:34:34;"You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"But baby baby"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"Something's telling me this ain't over yet"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"No way it was"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"Last night I kissed your lips"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"Make you grip your sheets with your fingertips"
01:34:44;01:34:47;"Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Just talking 'bout life going sip for sip"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"Yeah you, you know you love to fight"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"And I say that only"
01:34:54;01:34:55;"Oh interesting"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"He's not credited as a songwriter on this"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Really?"
01:34:58;01:34:59;"I guess it's just real Nashville stuff"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"This song is written by"
01:35:01;01:35:07;"John Byron, Ashley Gourley, Jacob Kasher, Hendlin, and Ryan Wojcik"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"I sent a Morgan Wallen song to Jake over text the other day"
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Did you?"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"Yep"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"What'd you send?"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"98 Braves"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Oh right"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"That's a good title"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"It's a great title"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"And it's a great song"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"Is it a rocker?"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"Yeah"
01:35:20;01:35:23;"It's sort of a metaphor comparing his relationship to this woman"
01:35:23;01:35:24;"To the 98 Braves"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"They were so close"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"But they couldn't make it"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"Could've been 96 Braves too"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"Up 2-0 in the World Series and they blow it"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"98 Braves"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Let me just see"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"Not a fan"
01:35:38;01:35:43;"The Stroke song's better"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"If it's performed by John McEnroe"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"I can go"
01:35:48;01:35:51;"My number one is John McEnroe doing the Strokes"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"Then Morgan Wallen, then the Strokes"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"The number three song back in 1990"
01:35:57;01:35:58;"Okay, here's a great"
01:35:58;01:36:02;"This is the best of what '89-'90 had to offer"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"This is the B-52s with Rome"
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Great song"
01:36:05;01:36:08;"I hear a wind"
01:36:08;01:36:12;"Through southern air"
01:36:12;01:36:19;"Whispering in my ear"
01:36:19;01:36:29;"Oh, Mercury"
01:36:29;01:36:33;"Shoots through every degree"
01:36:33;01:36:38;"Oh, girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"B-52s are such a great collection of voices"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"Lots of idiosyncratic but great singers"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"Around the world"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Around the world"
01:36:49;01:36:55;"The trip begins with a kiss"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"Rome if you want to"
01:36:58;01:37:02;"Rome around the world"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Rome if you want to"

01:37:23;01:37:26;"He knew they didn't need him on this one"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Rome!"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Come on, Rome!"
01:37:30;01:37:33;"It's pretty tight that the B-52s are like"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"decade plus into their career"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"You know, totally like"
01:37:37;01:37:40;"cool 70s punk adjacent band"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"and they just come back hard with this album"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"with Love Shack and Rome"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"Just two all-timers"
01:37:46;01:37:51;"B-52s with a wildness"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Around the world"
01:37:53;01:37:58;"The trip begins with a kiss"
01:37:58;01:38:02;"Rome if you want to"

01:38:24;01:38:27;"He knew they didn't need him on this one"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"Rome!"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Come on, Rome!"

01:39:01;01:39:02;"Rome!"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"With flowers, big hit"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"Off the hit album Endless Summer Vacation"
01:39:06;01:39:09;"Oh, this album's called Endless Summer Vacation? Sick"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"We were good, we were cold"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"I think last show I was like"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"The title's ""Won't it take too long?"""
01:39:15;01:39:20;"We were right, 'til we weren't"
01:39:20;01:39:24;"Built a home and watched it burn"
01:39:24;01:39:28;"I didn't want to leave you, I didn't want to lie"
01:39:28;01:39:33;"Started to cry but then remembered that I"
01:39:33;01:39:37;"I can buy myself flowers"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"Write my name in the sand"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"This was number one last week"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"'cause then it sent us down that"
01:39:43;01:39:46;"Cardigans tangent"
01:39:46;01:39:49;"Some days you don't understand"
01:39:49;01:39:52;"I can take myself dancing"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"Wow, you really hear her voice has aged"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"Yeah, I love this kind of smoky"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Like a fine wine"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"A fine Tennessee whiskey"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"It does sound like whiskey and cigarettes"
01:40:03;01:40:06;"I can love me better, baby"
01:40:06;01:40:09;"I can love me better, I can love me better, baby"
01:40:09;01:40:13;"Paint my nails cherry red"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"Match the roses that you lay"
01:40:17;01:40:21;"No remorse, no regret"
01:40:21;01:40:25;"I forget every word you say"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"I didn't want to leave you, baby"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"I didn't want to fight"
01:40:30;01:40:34;"Started to cry but then remembered I"
01:40:34;01:40:38;"I can buy myself flowers"
01:40:38;01:40:42;"Write my name in the sand"
01:40:42;01:40:46;"It's also got kind of like, yeah, ""I will survive"" energy"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Serious Beej, I was just going to say"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Beej's energy, with those strings"
01:40:51;01:40:54;"I can take myself dancing"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"It's also very fastball"
01:40:57;01:41:01;"That's a good call. Deep hole there."
01:41:01;01:41:04;"Yeah, fastball, that's some real funky uncle."
01:41:04;01:41:08;"Slightly generic, slightly throwback"
01:41:08;01:41:11;"Very, like, proficient pop song writing."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"A director of public representation"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"Or a 299-"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"- is available only at the Texas T.F. -"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- Is this fastball? - Yeah."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"- There's no other. - Okay."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"This band has always been fascinating to me."
01:41:35;01:41:38;"- Did you like this song? - No."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"- It was too throwback. - Yeah."
01:41:45;01:41:49;"- ""Eternal summer slacking"" - Kind of like-"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"I like some squeeze songs a lot."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"- Oh yeah, I love squeeze. - I like squeeze."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"What about ""Cake""?"
01:41:55;01:41:58;"I can get down with ""Cake."""
01:41:58;01:42:02;"Is this the same year as ""Sex and Candy""?"
01:42:02;01:42:06;"- This is like '90. - Yeah, exact same era."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"- When I was growing up. - When Jake was growing up."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Mackerel, when you were growing up, it was like ""The Monkees."""
01:42:17;01:42:20;"That would be, as you said, I loved ""The Monkees"" when I was growing up."
01:42:20;01:42:24;"Then as I got older, I got into some new wave stuff."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"I would have loved it if Mack and Rowe just dropped some ""Monkees."""
01:42:27;01:42:28;"- Yeah, that'd be sick. - Just like-"
01:42:28;01:42:31;"- All sixies. - When did John Mack and Rowe go professional?"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Like, when did he go pro?"
01:42:33;01:42:36;"He's born in '58, we said?"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"- I just feel like if he's already pro- - Late '70s?"
01:42:38;01:42:43;"- Yeah. - He can't say he's growing up if he's already a professional."
01:42:43;01:42:46;"He probably feels like he's grown up in public."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- '78. - That's when the cars came out, so."
01:42:49;01:42:53;"- Yeah. - Yeah, but he's already got a full-time job."
01:42:53;01:42:57;"Maybe the timeline's boring, man. He's 65, 64."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"Maybe he just believes that you never stop growing."
01:43:00;01:43:02;"That's right. Yeah, he's just like-"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"And this is another song from when I was growing up."
01:43:04;01:43:07;"It's by The Strokes, ""Reptilia."""
01:43:07;01:43:09;"But back to Miley Cyrus for a second."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"I just- Is this supposed to be kind of like a single anthem?"
01:43:12;01:43:16;"Or is it supposed to be- Is she an unreliable narrator in this song?"
01:43:16;01:43:19;"'Cause it doesn't feel very cheerful."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"It feels kind of sad."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"""I didn't want you to go."""
01:43:23;01:43:25;"- I haven't tapped into the lyrics yet. - Okay."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"""We were right 'til we weren't."
01:43:27;01:43:30;"Built a home and watched it burn."""
01:43:30;01:43:33;"Damn. Harsh."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"""I didn't want to leave you. I didn't want to lie."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"Started to remember. Oh, started to cry."""
01:43:39;01:43:42;"[laughs]"
01:43:42;01:43:46;"""I can promise?"""
01:43:46;01:43:49;"""I can buy myself flowers, write my name in the sand,"
01:43:49;01:43:53;"talk to myself for hours,"
01:43:53;01:43:57;"say things you don't understand."
01:43:57;01:44:01;"I can take myself dancing,"
01:44:01;01:44:06;"and I can hold my own hand."
01:44:06;01:44:09;"I can love me better than you can."""
01:44:09;01:44:11;"See, to me, it's-"
01:44:11;01:44:15;"Because it has this kind of sad French blues chords,"
01:44:15;01:44:19;"it's similar to ""It Was a Good Day"" by Ice Cube."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"This is a fantasy."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"But this was a fantasy."
01:44:23;01:44:26;"It's a bit of a- My take is that it's a delusion."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"That's why the song is so bittersweet."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"It's basically like, ""I didn't want you to leave. I didn't want you to go."""
01:44:31;01:44:34;"But then I really desperately had to craft a narrative"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"to make myself feel good about this,"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"because I was falling into a pit of despair."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"And then I realized something."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"I could buy myself flowers."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Yeah, they might not be most people's top three things"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"that they value in a relationship, but you're right."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"You could buy yourself flowers."
01:44:48;01:44:51;"You don't need a boyfriend or girlfriend to buy you flowers."
01:44:51;01:44:53;"I could write my name in the sand."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Okay, you're getting a little random."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"- You're pretty low-stakes there. - Yeah."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"You're right. You could have written your name in the sand before."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Talk to myself for hours."
01:45:02;01:45:05;"- To some extent. - That sounds kind of sad."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"Say things you don't understand."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Yeah, many of us are trapped in our heads"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"saying things incomprehensible to other people"
01:45:12;01:45:15;"for most of our lives, which is part of why"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"those moments when you can connect with somebody else"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"can feel like a relief."
01:45:20;01:45:23;"And then, ""I can take myself dancing."""
01:45:23;01:45:25;"- Eh. - [laughs]"
01:45:25;01:45:28;"Yeah, I mean, say I could go dancing with my friends."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"I could understand that more if you're like, ""You know what? I don't need you."
01:45:30;01:45:33;"It's time to just focus on me and my friends."""
01:45:33;01:45:35;"And then, ""I can hold my own hand."""
01:45:35;01:45:37;"That's when I'm starting to be like, ""Oh, okay."
01:45:37;01:45:40;"This is a sad person just trying."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"I can hold my own hand."""
01:45:42;01:45:43;"- What do you mean? - Yeah."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"No, you can't hold your own hand."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"You could put your hands together. You could clap."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"You could rub your hands together. You could do the money thing."
01:45:49;01:45:52;"Or like you're hungry, you could rub your hands together."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"- You're not holding. - That's not what it means."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"You can't hold your own hand."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"And then it says, ""I can love me better than you can,"""
01:45:58;01:46:00;"which I understand the sentiment."
01:46:00;01:46:04;"Because, of course, it's a concept in popular culture,"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"which I think has real meaning."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"If you don't love yourself and you're not okay with yourself,"
01:46:08;01:46:12;"you can't accept other people's love, and you might not be able to love them."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"I understand what you're saying."
01:46:13;01:46:16;"Loving myself is important. Being okay with yourself."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"Liking yourself. These are all really important things."
01:46:18;01:46:22;"But now in the context of this song, this sounds kind of sad."
01:46:22;01:46:25;"""I can love me better than you can."""
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Maybe she doesn't really believe it."
01:46:27;01:46:30;"That's my take. This is a sad song. It's not empowering."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Is it supposed to be? Yeah, I take it."
01:46:32;01:46:36;"It seems very straightforwardly sad and like a bummer."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Seinfeld, you're up there on social media."
01:46:38;01:46:41;"I don't know how much people are talking about it in the Seinfeld space,"
01:46:41;01:46:45;"but in the larger social media world, is this song seen as empowering"
01:46:45;01:46:49;"or sort of like about the delusional bargaining"
01:46:49;01:46:52;"some person might do if their heart is broken?"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Yeah, the second one."
01:46:53;01:46:56;"That's how people are interpreting it in the Seinfeld space?"
01:46:56;01:46:59;"No, the Twitter sphere in general, that's kind of what it boils down to."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"Okay, so it is accepted. This is a sad song."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"100%."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Okay."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"With a deceptive title."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Correct."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Flowers."
01:47:06;01:47:11;"Yeah. Like sort of ironically, like a deliberately deceptive title."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Yeah, she's in on it."
01:47:13;01:47:17;"Because in fact, it brings to mind the classic line written by Prince"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"in the Sinead O'Connor hit, ""Nothing Compares to You."""
01:47:20;01:47:23;"""I could eat my dinner at a fancy restaurant."""
01:47:23;01:47:26;"But what did they say?"
01:47:26;01:47:30;"""I could eat my dinner at a fancy restaurant."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"It'd only remind me of you."""
01:47:32;01:47:33;"Yeah, something like that."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"Yeah."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"""I'd go out every day and..."""
01:47:37;01:47:39;"Yeah, so maybe the songs are saying the same thing."
01:47:39;01:47:41;"This one's just more..."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"It's interesting. It's just more delusional."
01:47:43;01:47:47;"Yeah, the Prince song, it's a much more jarring image."
01:47:47;01:47:50;"Eating by yourself at a fancy restaurant."
01:47:50;01:47:51;"Yeah, right."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"It's a much more viscerally emo."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"I could buy myself flowers. Sure, you could."
01:47:56;01:47:59;"You're at the Vons. You're picking up a pint of ice cream."

01:59:39;01:59:40;"It's pretty good."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"It's not weird."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"Neon beach party nights?"
01:59:42;01:59:45;"Yeah, neon beach party nights is if you're like--"
01:59:45;01:59:53;"come up with a song about summer by a really generic indie band from the early 2010s."
01:59:53;01:59:56;"I was going to say, it sounds like a Miley Cyrus song about summer."
01:59:56;01:59:57;"All right."
01:59:57;02:00:01;"Well, Miley could--yeah, ""Neon Summer."""
02:00:01;02:00:02;"It paints a picture of--"
02:00:02;02:00:03;"♪ Neon Summer ♪"
02:00:03;02:00:04;"What is ""Neon Summer""?"
02:00:04;02:00:07;"Neon beach party nights."

02:00:15;02:00:21;"and their album was called Neon Beach Party Nights--"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"Fair."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"Yeah, I mean, we're getting away from Janet Jackson territory."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"I agree."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"Very disappointed in the chat, GPT."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"Come on, get your stuff together."
02:00:28;02:00:34;"The number one song, which probably deserves a bit of discussion, but here we are at the end."
02:00:34;02:00:36;"I don't know if we're going to talk about it that much."
02:00:36;02:00:37;"This is pretty weird."
02:00:37;02:00:38;"What is this?"
02:00:38;02:00:46;"The number one song on iTunes right now is Donald J. Trump and the J6 prison choir, ""Justice for All."""
02:00:46;02:00:47;"What?"
02:00:47;02:00:53;"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America."
02:00:53;02:00:54;"This is deep."
02:00:54;02:00:57;"This is bizarre."
02:00:57;02:01:00;"This is a charity record by Donald Trump and the J6 prison choir,"
02:01:00;02:01:07;"a choir of about 20 men in prison for their involvement in the January 6th United States Capitol attack."

02:01:12;02:01:18;"interspersed with the J6 prison choir sing the Star Spangled Banner with an ambient backing track."
02:01:18;02:01:23;"[singing]"
02:01:23;02:01:27;"So this was planned. This wasn't just audio from his presidency."
02:01:27;02:01:28;"It's original."
02:01:28;02:01:29;"He recorded it."
02:01:29;02:01:32;"I think they said, ""Donald, we need you on the charity single,"""
02:01:32;02:01:36;"and he said, ""I got a home studio, Mar-a-Lago, come through."""
02:01:36;02:01:38;"Strange stuff."
