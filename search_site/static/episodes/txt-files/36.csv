00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis. It's February and we're back."
00:06;00:08;"We've got a great show this week."

00:16;00:19;"Plus, it's the day of the Grammys."
00:19;00:24;"So we'll be digging back into Grammy history from 1981 and today."
00:24;00:26;"This is..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:32;"B-B-B-Beast."
00:32;00:34;"One."
00:42;00:53;"All my rightful chances My picture clear Everything seems so easy"
00:53;01:05;"And so I tell to the blow One of us had to go Now it's different I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying One of us is lying"
01:11;01:16;"We've been only made"
01:16;01:20;"Time Crisis, February 12th, 2017."
01:20;01:21;"It's Grammy Day, Jake."
01:21;01:23;"Did you know that?"
01:23;01:24;"I did."
01:24;01:25;"I'm about to roll to the Grammys."
01:25;01:26;"Are you?"
01:26;01:27;"You're going?"
01:27;01:28;"Yeah, man."
01:28;01:29;"Why?"
01:29;01:30;"Because I'm nominated."
01:30;01:31;"You are?"
01:31;01:32;"For what?"
01:32;01:35;"I don't think a lot of people know, but I'm nominated for Album of the Year."
01:35;01:37;"What?"
01:37;01:38;"For Time Crisis."
01:38;01:39;"Oh!"
01:39;01:40;"Comedy, album of the year."
01:40;01:41;"Comedy, album of the year."
01:41;01:45;"I'm nominated for Album of the Year because of my work on the Beyonce album."
01:45;01:46;"That's right."
01:46;01:49;"I've learned a lot about, it's complicated."
01:49;01:53;"In different categories, different people get nominated."
01:53;01:57;"But for Album of the Year, all featured artists and all producers are nominated."
01:57;02:02;"As a producer on the song Hold Up, I'm nominated."
02:02;02:03;"Okay."
02:03;02:04;"That was my question."
02:04;02:05;"I was like, were you a featured artist or were you a..."
02:05;02:07;"No, it's as a producer."
02:07;02:08;"Not as a writer."
02:08;02:10;"Writers don't get nominated."
02:10;02:11;"So you helped produce that song?"
02:11;02:13;"I thought you just wrote that."
02:13;02:15;"Remember last year we did that whole segment?"
02:15;02:16;"Yeah, we broke it down."
02:16;02:17;"That was cool."
02:17;02:20;"No, me and Diplo and Beyonce are the three producers on that song."
02:20;02:21;"Really?"
02:21;02:22;"Yeah."
02:22;02:23;"That's cool, man."
02:23;02:24;"We'll see."
02:24;02:25;"So are you going to sit with them?"
02:25;02:28;"See, I don't know how all that's going to go down."
02:28;02:29;"I think..."
02:29;02:30;"There's like harsh hierarchies."
02:30;02:37;"Well, I heard that I will be sitting in the vicinity of Beyonce because I think they try"
02:37;02:39;"to keep the crew..."
02:39;02:40;"We're rolling with the crew."
02:40;02:42;"We're going to go with Ariel too."
02:42;02:43;"Okay."
02:43;02:47;"Because Ariel's also nominated for album of the year because he worked on the Adele album."
02:47;02:48;"Oh, wow."
02:48;02:49;"So I'm going head to head."
02:49;02:51;"God, look at you guys."
02:51;02:54;"Going head to head with one of my good friends."
02:54;02:56;"I was just asking somebody, ""Oh, can we all sit together?"""
02:56;02:59;"And they're like, ""Well, you got to sit by Beyonce and Ariel's got to sit by Adele."""
02:59;03:00;"And I was like, ""Really?"
03:00;03:02;"Because I don't think Beyonce and Adele care."""
03:02;03:03;"Yeah."
03:03;03:07;"So if she won, you'd go up on stage with her?"
03:07;03:08;"That's another question."
03:08;03:10;"I'm not aware of that."
03:10;03:12;"That's something I'm going to have to figure out there."
03:12;03:13;"Here's the thing."
03:13;03:14;"I wasn't even sure I was going to go."
03:14;03:16;"Wait, why is that?"
03:16;03:19;"Just because..."
03:19;03:23;"You know, like most things, most things are better to watch on TV."
03:23;03:25;"I was just thinking about this because of the Super Bowl."
03:25;03:26;"Okay."
03:26;03:31;"Because I was talking to a dude who's like a huge Boston sports fan and he was really"
03:31;03:33;"torn up about all the Trump connections on the Pats."
03:33;03:34;"Right."
03:34;03:38;"And he was like, ""You know, I had a ticket to go."""
03:38;03:39;"This is actually before."
03:39;03:41;"We were having dinner before the Super Bowl and he's like, ""You know, I had a ticket to"
03:41;03:46;"go to the Super Bowl, but I feel like I should just watch it on TV."
03:46;03:49;"I feel like going there, it feels too weird with the political situation."""
03:49;03:52;"And he's trying to make a moral choice."
03:52;03:53;"Wow."
03:53;03:57;"I wonder if he regrets it now that it's considered one of the best Patriots games of all time."
03:57;04:00;"But anyway, he was saying all this to me like, ""Yeah, I don't know."
04:00;04:02;"I know it'd be really fun."
04:02;04:04;"I love going to see football games."""
04:04;04:08;"And I was like, ""Look, morality aside, isn't it just better to watch on TV?"""
04:08;04:09;"Yeah."
04:09;04:11;"I went to the Super Bowl once."
04:11;04:12;"Really?"
04:12;04:13;"Yeah."
04:13;04:17;"When it was in New Jersey at the MetLife Stadium."
04:17;04:20;"And I was just watching it and I was like, ""We have good seats."""
04:20;04:21;"And I was like, ""I can't tell what's going on."""
04:21;04:22;"Yeah."
04:22;04:23;"Bruno Mars did the halftime show."
04:23;04:26;"I couldn't hear a damn word."
04:26;04:31;"I was like, ""I wish I was watching this at home on the flat screen, Trey Buffalo wings,"
04:31;04:34;"all the bros, surround sound."""
04:34;04:35;"So anyway."
04:35;04:36;"Yeah."
04:36;04:37;"Football's weird."
04:37;04:38;"There's so many down times and timeouts."
04:38;04:41;"And I never have any idea what's going on."
04:41;04:43;"It's hard enough to follow, let alone being in a giant thing."
04:43;04:44;"I've gone to some college games."
04:44;04:45;"Really?"
04:45;04:46;"Yeah."
04:46;04:47;"What college games?"
04:47;04:48;"University of Alabama?"
04:48;04:49;"No."
04:49;04:55;"My friend Kyle Field, his dad used to be the defensive coordinator for UCLA Bruins for"
04:55;04:56;"years."
04:56;04:57;"Oh, really?"
04:57;04:58;"Yeah."
04:58;04:59;"Oh, wow."
04:59;05:00;"And that's a serious-"
05:00;05:01;"Yeah."
05:01;05:03;"So Kyle grew up in this heavy football house."
05:03;05:07;"So I've gone with him and his brothers to a UCLA game."
05:07;05:08;"Oh, wow."
05:08;05:09;"But I had no-"
05:09;05:10;"And I don't really know football."
05:10;05:11;"It's my least favorite sport."
05:11;05:14;"And there were so many times when there would just be a weird turnout."
05:14;05:15;"I don't even-"
05:15;05:18;"Some of them would fumble the ball or whatever, and there'd be a-"
05:18;05:19;"See, this is terrible."
05:19;05:20;"This is terrible."
05:20;05:21;"I can't-"
05:21;05:22;"You'd just be like, ""I don't know what's happening."""
05:22;05:23;"Yeah."
05:23;05:25;"They were just like, ""Well, here's the thing with football."""
05:25;05:27;"And okay, people say baseball's slow."
05:27;05:28;"But you like baseball."
05:28;05:29;"I love baseball."
05:29;05:33;"I love baseball because it takes three hours to play an hour-long game, which to me is"
05:33;05:35;"like insane."
05:35;05:37;"You might like rugby."
05:37;05:38;"I doubt it."
05:38;05:44;"I think you should start supporting the New Zealand National Rugby Squad."
05:44;05:47;"It's like football except there's no brakes."
05:47;05:49;"And the clothes are better."
05:49;05:50;"That's heavy about your friend, though."
05:50;05:51;"Oh, yeah."
05:51;05:52;"Skipping the ball."
05:52;05:53;"Oh, yeah."
05:53;05:54;"We're going into Russian doll storytelling."
05:54;05:55;"Yeah, yeah."
05:55;05:56;"So he skipped it."
05:56;05:59;"At the time, I was just also being like, ""Dude, it's not a hard choice."""
05:59;06:05;"It's like not only you don't have to go shell out all this money to go support an organization"
06:05;06:09;"that maybe you're having mixed feelings about because of Robert Kraft and the Trump and"
06:09;06:11;"Bill Belichick."
06:11;06:14;"It's also just going to be better to watch it at home with a bunch of your Boston friends"
06:14;06:15;"or whatever."
06:15;06:16;"Who's Robert Kraft?"
06:16;06:17;"Who's that?"
06:17;06:20;"Robert Kraft is the owner of the New England Patriots."
06:20;06:25;"Also an alumnus of Columbia University because I remember there's a bunch of junk named after"
06:25;06:27;"him when I was an undergrad."
06:27;06:29;"Is there a relation to the Kraft Foods Group?"
06:29;06:30;"I don't think so."
06:30;06:31;"Okay."
06:31;06:32;"Different spelling."
06:32;06:33;"You know who owns the Falcons?"
06:33;06:34;"The losers."
06:34;06:35;"Coke?"
06:35;06:36;"No."
06:36;06:37;"The Home Depot dude."
06:37;06:39;"Oh, my God."
06:39;06:41;"He's also like a crazy right winger, right?"
06:41;06:42;"Is he?"
06:42;06:43;"Yeah, I think so."
06:43;06:44;"Oh, man."
06:44;06:45;"You can't win."
06:45;06:46;"His name's Arthur Blank."
06:46;06:47;"He was wearing like a funny suit on the field."
06:47;06:48;"But anyway, my point is like stuff is better on TV."
06:48;06:49;"Right."
06:49;06:50;"So don't play yourself."
06:50;06:51;"And the Grammys."
06:51;06:56;"The Grammys are better on TV because when you sit there, even if you have good seats on"
06:56;06:59;"the floor, you know, they have all these stages."
06:59;07:02;"It's like Saturday Night Live where there's like four stages because they have to switch"
07:02;07:03;"from that to that."
07:03;07:05;"So there's no such thing as a great seat."
07:05;07:06;"You can't see the details."
07:06;07:08;"So Katy Perry's over here and you're craning your neck."
07:08;07:13;"And then on the left is Imagine Dragons and featuring Kendrick Lamar."
07:13;07:16;"So there's four stages?"
07:16;07:17;"There's at least like three."
07:17;07:18;"No, yeah, there's like four."
07:18;07:21;"So that means three quarters of the time you're just looking at nothing."
07:21;07:22;"And then kind of."
07:22;07:24;"Well, you got to like turn around."
07:24;07:26;"And then suddenly somebody is like performing behind you."
07:26;07:27;"Wow."
07:27;07:29;"Elton John and Eminem are like."
07:29;07:34;"So I'm just saying my initial gut impulse was like I'd happily watch the Grammys at"
07:34;07:39;"home, play to Buffalo Wings, all my Boston guys surrounding me as always."
07:39;07:41;"And so I was like, I'm probably not going to go."
07:41;07:42;"Yeah."
07:42;07:49;"All my all my Boston boys just enjoying some some wings."
07:49;07:51;"So I was like, I don't need to go."
07:51;07:55;"And also, like, obviously, I'm proud of my work on the Beyonce album, but it is like"
07:55;07:57;"a tangential nomination."
07:57;07:58;"Yeah."
07:58;08:00;"You know, it's like it's her album, obviously."
08:00;08:04;"Would you actually get one of those little horn statues?"
08:04;08:05;"It's called a Grammy."
08:05;08:06;"Oh, oh, yeah."
08:06;08:07;"Oh, it's a gramophone."
08:07;08:08;"OK."
08:08;08:09;"Yeah."
08:10;08:11;"No, I would get one."
08:11;08:16;"You know, a horn statue."
08:16;08:19;"And and the golden bubble wrap."
08:19;08:25;"The golden back of the closet, the golden horn statue for album of the year goes to"
08:25;08:26;"Steely Dan for Two Against Nature."
08:26;08:48;"And I'm sure you'll get one of those."
08:48;09:11;"Thank you."
09:11;09:40;"Thank you."
09:40;09:59;"Thank you."
09:59;10:04;"So I was thinking I wasn't going to go and then like Ariel was going to go and then I"
10:04;10:06;"was like, all right, maybe maybe it'll be kind of fun."
10:06;10:07;"It'll be exciting to be."
10:07;10:12;"I haven't been since I've been in a few years."
10:12;10:16;"But then as far as this getting up on stage thing, I do legitimately have some anxiety"
10:16;10:21;"about that, because historically, when somebody wins album of the year, the whole gang does"
10:21;10:22;"often."
10:22;10:23;"Well, I don't know."
10:23;10:24;"Maybe I should be doing some research."
10:24;10:26;"Often the whole gang goes on stage."
10:26;10:30;"You can probably picture when Taylor Swift won album of the year a couple of years ago"
10:30;10:35;"and she clearly because you see that picture comes up a lot because, you know, that this"
10:35;10:38;"unending drama between her and Kanye and the Kardashians."
10:38;10:40;"So there's always a picture of her giving her speech."
10:40;10:45;"And you can see she's like flanked by all the producers."
10:45;10:48;"Seinfeld 2000 just pulled up the image."
10:48;10:50;"It says album of the year behind her."
10:50;10:51;"She's holding the horn statue."
10:51;10:56;"She's wearing a magenta and orange dress."
10:56;11:03;"And behind her are eight or nine men in tuxedos."
11:03;11:06;"One guy is one guy wearing a leather jacket."
11:06;11:10;"Oh, Macklemore standing on stage because he must have given it to her."
11:10;11:13;"Or maybe he has a feature on that album that I forgot."
11:13;11:14;"Or maybe that's not Macklemore."
11:14;11:17;"But is it your call whether to go on stage or is there going to be like some dude with"
11:17;11:19;"a wireless headset?"
11:19;11:22;"It's just like, see, I don't know."
11:22;11:25;"That's not stressful because here's my feeling."
11:25;11:27;"I don't feel one way or another about it."
11:27;11:30;"If she wins, I think it should be her call."
11:30;11:31;"Right."
11:31;11:32;"Does she want to go?"
11:32;11:35;"I mean, she wants to say something and doesn't want to be surrounded by right."
11:35;11:38;"Twenty five knuckleheads."
11:38;11:44;"But at the same time, if everybody else went on stage and I was like too nervous or something,"
11:44;11:47;"I don't want to like hang back and then imagine like a really bad scenario."
11:47;11:50;"Then what if everybody did go on stage?"
11:50;11:54;"And then I'm like, oh, so we're going on stage and like, yeah, you should go."
11:54;11:56;"And then like I'm like the last idiot on stage."
11:56;12:00;"She already started talking like that would be even worse."
12:00;12:04;"So anyway, I just I think it should be the artist's prerogative."
12:04;12:06;"Yeah, but you see it in other years."
12:06;12:07;"You see everybody just jumps up and they're running."
12:07;12:11;"I don't know."
12:11;12:12;"Stressful man."
12:12;12:13;"We'll find out."
12:13;12:15;"Sounds like dodgeball or something."
12:15;12:16;"Yeah."
12:16;12:18;"You just like jockeying for the right position."
12:18;12:20;"Like when when the pinata breaks open."
12:20;12:21;"So it's her."
12:21;12:22;"It's Adele."
12:22;12:25;"Sturgill Simpson is also nominated for album of the year."
12:25;12:26;"Twenty one pilots."
12:26;12:28;"They did not get a nom for album of the year."
12:28;12:29;"Chainsmokes."
12:29;12:32;"Chainsmokers have never released an album."
12:32;12:33;"OK."
12:33;12:35;"Sheer Mag."
12:35;12:38;"No, it's Bieber."
12:38;12:40;"Oh, another time."
12:40;12:42;"Crisis favorite is nominated."
12:42;12:45;"The favorites are Beyonce and Adele."
12:45;12:51;"But then sometimes it happens that the two front runners rob votes from one another and"
12:51;12:53;"then you get the surprise victory."
12:53;12:57;"So maybe you get a Sturgill."
12:57;12:59;"That's how people felt when Beck won."
12:59;13:00;"Oh, yeah."
13:00;13:01;"I don't know."
13:01;13:03;"I got to figure out what to wear."
13:03;13:04;"Straight up tux."
13:04;13:06;"No, definitely not a tux."
13:06;13:11;"I went the first time Vampire Weekend was nominated and we'd never been before."
13:11;13:13;"Felt like, oh, we should dress up a little bit."
13:13;13:18;"And I was wearing kind of like like a fancy blazer."
13:18;13:20;"What album was this for?"
13:20;13:23;"Contra was nominated for best alternative album."
13:23;13:26;"We lost to the Black Keys."
13:26;13:30;"We went and was like kind of dressed up and I was like, this is I was like, if I ever"
13:30;13:33;"come back here, I'm going to like be way more casual."
13:33;13:38;"And then the next time we came back, I just wore a sweater and then we actually won."
13:38;13:39;"And I felt way more comfortable."
13:39;13:40;"And I'm like, I'm glad."
13:40;13:46;"Yeah, because the Grammys, you do have everything from people wearing tuxedos to T-shirts."
13:46;13:47;"Yeah."
13:47;13:49;"Like Kid Rock's wearing like a Bob Seger tee."
13:49;13:50;"You can wear whatever you want."
13:50;13:51;"Yeah."
13:51;13:52;"I mean, you're an artist."
13:52;13:53;"You should wear whatever you want."
13:53;13:54;"Right."
13:54;13:56;"You're a weirdo."
13:56;13:57;"Yeah."
13:57;13:58;"You still want to look good."
13:58;13:59;"I don't know."
13:59;14:00;"I'll figure it out."
14:00;14:01;"Turn mailboxes into baseball."
14:01;14:02;"Don't get busted selling at 17."

16:50;16:52;"You're listening to"

16:56;16:59;"Speaking of Grammys, later in the show"
16:59;17:01;"we'll be going over some of the nominees"
17:01;17:03;"for Song of the Year."
17:03;17:05;"We'll be talking a little bit about Grammy history."
17:05;17:08;"We'll also be taking some questions from listeners,"
17:08;17:10;"which somehow we've never actually done,"
17:10;17:13;"but Seinfeld 2000 got some questions."
17:13;17:16;"Very excitingly, we're going to delve back"
17:16;17:18;"into the world of Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
17:18;17:20;"which it just won't stop."
17:20;17:22;"We're going to be hearing from David Berkowitz,"
17:22;17:25;"owner of The Bagel Nook in Freehold, New Jersey."
17:25;17:28;"Now obviously, it'd be exciting to talk to the owner"
17:28;17:30;"of The Bagel Nook, period, but we're especially excited"
17:30;17:33;"to talk to him because he was the first bagel maker"
17:33;17:37;"in the country to create a Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
17:37;17:39;"They've sent some to us that we're going to eat"
17:39;17:41;"and enjoy on air."
17:41;17:43;"We're going to chop it up with David Berkowitz."
17:43;17:44;"I wonder what he does."
17:44;17:46;"He buys bags of Flamin' Hot and then like"
17:46;17:48;"mashes them up and then we'll have to ask him."
17:48;17:50;"A lot of inventors are tight-lipped."
17:50;17:52;"That sounds so gnarly, that bagel."
17:52;17:54;"Okay, well, when the time comes,"
17:54;17:56;"you better show some respect to Mr. Berkowitz."
17:56;17:58;"Are we going to try them before or after we talk to him?"
17:58;18:00;"I don't know. What do you think we should do?"
18:00;18:01;"Before?"
18:01;18:03;"I don't want to disrespect him."
18:03;18:05;"Yeah, but I feel like we should know a little bit"
18:05;18:06;"what we're dealing with."
18:06;18:08;"All right, so we'll eat it before we talk to him."
18:08;18:10;"Anyway, back to time crisis."
18:10;18:11;"Yeah."
18:11;18:13;"So, Jake, I heard you went to a trainer for the first time."
18:13;18:15;"Oh, yeah, dude. This was a big week for me."
18:15;18:16;"I turned 40."
18:16;18:17;"Yeah, happy birthday."
18:17;18:19;"Oh, wait. I didn't realize you already turned 40."
18:19;18:21;"Yeah, I turned 40 on February 3rd."
18:21;18:25;"Oh, okay, because Jake's birthday party has not happened yet."
18:25;18:26;"Yeah, it's happening soon."
18:26;18:29;"So, okay, I didn't realize that the actual B-Day came and went."
18:29;18:30;"Yeah, yeah."
18:30;18:31;"Happy 40th, man."
18:31;18:32;"Thanks, man."
18:32;18:33;"Wow, okay."
18:33;18:34;"It's got some gravity to it."
18:34;18:35;"So that's major."
18:35;18:36;"Yeah."
18:36;18:39;"I think most people think of you as kind of an eternally youthful kind of guy."
18:39;18:41;"Oh, that's cool. I'll take it."
18:41;18:44;"No, I mean, like, you're mellow."
18:44;18:46;"You like music, chilling."
18:46;18:48;"Like, you're not like some uptight--"
18:48;18:49;"Real estate guy."
18:49;18:51;"Yeah, 40-year-old real estate guy, you know."
18:51;18:54;"But so you said this was a big week for you."
18:54;18:55;"You turned 40."
18:55;18:56;"Oh, yeah."
18:56;18:58;"And you also decided to start getting in shape."
18:58;19:02;"Yeah, so Hannah got me some sessions with a trainer."
19:02;19:09;"You know, I run and stuff, and so I'm not like crazy out of shape, but I'm not very strong."
19:09;19:10;"Right."
19:10;19:14;"I'm in decent shape in terms of cardio, but in terms of strength, I'm not there."
19:14;19:16;"So anyway, I did this session with this dude, and it was so--"
19:16;19:18;"And it's because you want to be stronger?"
19:18;19:21;"Do you also want to see more definition?"
19:21;19:25;"No, it's more of like-- I have like a mild pot belly."
19:25;19:26;"You know what I mean?"
19:26;19:27;"Like nothing crazy."
19:27;19:28;"It's like-- but let's be real."
19:28;19:31;"It's like I could lose five pounds and that'd be fine."
19:31;19:32;"You got MPB."
19:32;19:38;"I'm more of thinking about like turning 40, getting older, want to like be strong as I age."
19:38;19:42;"So I don't have like terrible physical ailments as I age."
19:42;19:50;"Yeah, and also just it's really important that as much as many men want to tone and define their show muscles,"
19:50;19:56;"there are also these core muscles like in your back, whatever those ones that go along your ribs,"
19:56;20:04;"and that's the kind of stuff that's going to save you from slipping a disc when you're moving the coffee table"
20:04;20:08;"or picking up the garbage can or whatever."
20:08;20:10;"What's the tune situation over at the gym?"
20:10;20:12;"Did you get to pick?"
20:12;20:13;"No, there were a bunch-- it was hectic."
20:13;20:18;"It was his gym, this dude, and there was a lot of people working out, and I don't think--"
20:18;20:19;"I was just like, ""Whatever's playing."""
20:19;20:22;"I'm surprised to say this, but I didn't notice."
20:22;20:25;"Usually I notice tunes in those kind of contexts."
20:25;20:27;"Well, maybe you're just like hanging on for dear life."
20:27;20:29;"You're like doing these things you hadn't done before."
20:29;20:31;"You're like just focused on the task at hand."
20:31;20:36;"There were a lot of dudes with like earbuds who were pretty jacked, who were in their own zone."
20:36;20:39;"You should just go tap one of those guys on the shoulder like--"
20:39;20:45;"just like some like diesel dude just like doing like reps, and you just like tap him on the shoulder like,"
20:45;20:47;"""Hey, man, I'm Jake. I'm new to the gym."
20:47;20:49;"I'm just curious. What tunes are you listening to?"
20:49;20:51;"What helps you with your workout?"""
20:51;20:53;"He's like, ""I'm listening to this show called Time Crisis."""
20:53;20:55;"Yeah."
20:55;20:58;"Sick."
20:58;20:59;"Used to be good. Got real bad."
20:59;21:01;"Got real bad."
21:01;21:05;"When I work out with a trainer, it's at this gym where there's like these different rooms."
21:05;21:10;"So often you are by yourself, and you get to like jack into the speaker system in the room."
21:10;21:11;"It's a private room. Interesting."
21:11;21:13;"Well, if you're lucky."
21:13;21:16;"And I often go at weird times of day."
21:16;21:17;"I like a nice 4 p.m."
21:17;21:19;"Oh, wow."
21:19;21:23;"I'm like deep into my zone at 4. That's crazy."
21:23;21:30;"No, because I could go do some stuff in the morning, come do it at 4, get home at 6, relax,"
21:30;21:33;"watch some films or programs, then dinner time."
21:33;21:35;"It's actually kind of tight, but--"
21:35;21:38;"And then you work after dinner?"
21:38;21:40;"Or you just like-- your day ends at like 3?"
21:40;21:43;"Well, I'm always working."
21:43;21:44;"It depends."
21:44;21:47;"If I was going to go to the studio, I would do it before."
21:47;21:48;"You would do the workout before?"
21:48;21:53;"No, no, I would go to the studio at like 10 to 4 and then go to the gym."
21:53;21:56;"It depends on the day, but there's nobody there at 4."
21:56;22:01;"And then if I went at 9, then everybody's there, and you got people looking at you, you're looking at people."
22:01;22:07;"But so sometimes it's empty, and there's--"
22:07;22:09;"He's like a really funny guy. I like him. We have a good rapport."
22:09;22:15;"But he plays what I would say is like typical gym music, which is like pop or like the hip-hop of the moment,"
22:15;22:17;"stuff with like a hard-driving beat."
22:17;22:18;"That's what I was playing."
22:18;22:20;"It was just rap. I didn't know what it was."
22:20;22:25;"He always plays like a hip-hop playlist where that's like--"
22:25;22:28;"He plays one that's like a couple years out of date."
22:28;22:32;"It's like all Drake songs from two years ago, and it's good stuff. I enjoy it."
22:32;22:36;"But every once in a while, he'll be like, ""Do you have anything you want to listen to?"""
22:36;22:39;"And then I might put on like a--"
22:39;22:42;"Once I wanted to listen to this Paolo Conte album."
22:42;22:46;"He's kind of like the Italian Leonard Cohen or Serge Gainsbourg, like a singer-songwriter,"
22:46;22:52;"very sophisticated, jazz-influenced, Latin/Italian type music."
22:52;22:53;"That's cool."
22:53;22:57;"Because I just wanted to hear it, and I was like, ""This is a good opportunity for me to hear this whole album while I'm working out."""
22:57;23:03;"And he actually stopped, and he's like, ""Dude, this is not good workout music."""
23:03;23:08;"And I was like, ""It doesn't bother me."" He's like, ""Dude, this is not good workout music. You're not going to get a good workout."""
23:08;23:09;"That's funny."
23:09;23:12;"And I was kind of with it. I was like, ""You know what? I'm going to enroll."""
23:12;23:16;"I'd want to put on like George Jones or something, like the most--"
23:16;23:17;"Some country?"
23:17;23:20;"But like the saddest, slowest country ballads."
23:20;23:21;"I remember when--"
23:21;23:22;"Just doing push-ups."
23:22;23:27;"The first time I ever really started going to the gym was probably like four years ago."
23:27;23:35;"And to me, the ultimate song I always will associate with the gym is Zedd ""Clarity."""
23:35;23:36;"Do you know that one?"
23:36;23:38;"I don't know. Maybe I've heard it."
23:38;23:45;"If our love is class and why are you my remedy?"
23:45;23:48;"If our love--"
23:48;23:49;"I don't know."
23:49;23:50;"Let me play a little bit, see if it--"
23:50;23:56;"Because maybe this would be a good tune for you to jack through your ear buds."
23:56;24:02;"This was a huge song. This is like an all-time gym classic to me."
24:09;24:16;"I dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life."
24:16;24:21;"Fight fear for the selfish pain it was worth it."
24:21;24:22;"You recognize it so far?"
24:22;24:23;"No."
24:23;24:25;"So are you doing ear buds or are you doing like through the speakers?"
24:25;24:30;"No, no. I wouldn't play this myself. This is just blasting in the gym."
24:30;24:37;"A cocktail, say it breaks your glass and I drown in you again."
24:37;24:38;"I don't know this song."
24:38;24:40;"But so picture this. It's like--"
24:40;24:41;"Yeah."
24:41;24:42;"You're on the treadmill."
24:42;24:43;"Yeah."
24:43;24:46;"You're at six miles per hour."
24:46;24:48;"It's like, whoo."
24:48;24:49;"It's already pretty tough."
24:49;24:54;"Man, did you see that photograph from the women's march in New York?"
24:54;25:00;"I was going by this gym and there was one dude on like a treadmill."
25:00;25:01;"Uh-huh."
25:01;25:07;"Like in this gym and there was like thousands of people in the women's march right in front of him."
25:07;25:08;"Oh, he was just working out?"
25:08;25:09;"Yeah, he was just working out."
25:09;25:12;"Let's listen to this."
25:12;25:13;"What are they doing?"
25:13;25:14;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
25:14;25:15;"Weird."
25:15;25:16;"[Laughter]"
25:16;25:19;"[Exhales]"
25:19;25:21;"Smiggy, you want to pump some iron?"
25:21;25:23;"It's pretty tight."
25:39;25:47;"If all love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?"
25:47;25:54;"If all love is sanity, why are you my clarity?"
25:54;26:00;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
26:00;26:02;"Anyway, that's a classic D.R.I.M.P. song."
26:02;26:04;"So shout out to Zedd."
26:04;26:08;"And don't forget Foxes."
26:08;26:10;"A lot of people don't know that song is Zedd featuring Foxes."
26:10;26:12;"It's called Clarity."
26:12;26:14;"Maybe it's time to go to the other end of the spectrum."
26:14;26:15;"We've been talking fitness."
26:15;26:17;"Let's talk about the opposite of fitness."
26:17;26:18;"Carbs."
26:19;26:25;"So the Bagel Nook in Freehold, New Jersey actually sent us kind of like a cornucopia of all sorts of bagels."
26:25;26:31;"So from what I understand about the Bagel Nook, they're getting a lot of national press by doing kind of crazy stuff."
26:31;26:35;"Like they have Oreo cream cheese, Oreo bagels."
26:35;26:40;"They have birthday cake cream cheese, and now they have Flamin' Hot Cheeto bagels."
26:40;26:42;"And this is just a small place in Freehold, New Jersey."
26:42;26:43;"Wow."
26:43;26:44;"You know who's from Freehold, New Jersey."
26:44;26:45;"Springsteen, right?"
26:45;26:46;"That's right."
26:46;26:48;"Shout out to Mr. Berkowitz."
26:48;26:49;"He sent us a lot."
26:49;26:50;"We got Captain Crunch Oreo bagels."
26:50;26:53;"But we're going to try the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
26:53;26:56;"I put jalapeño cream cheese on mine."
26:56;26:58;"So did I, and I cracked a modelo too."
26:58;26:59;"Oh, it's not bad."
26:59;27:02;"You know, I'm actually not picking up on too much of the Flamin' Hot."
27:02;27:03;"It's not very spicy."
27:03;27:04;"No."
27:04;27:07;"You eat a lot of bagels growing up."
27:07;27:10;"Yeah, but bad ones."
27:10;27:12;"Lenders, frozen."
27:12;27:14;"Oh, yeah, lenders are garbage."
27:14;27:15;"Picture this, dude."
27:15;27:17;"Late 80s, early 90s."
27:17;27:19;"It's like a winter morning."
27:19;27:20;"It's pitch black."
27:20;27:23;"NPR on in the kitchen."
27:23;27:24;"What day of the week?"
27:24;27:25;"School day?"
27:25;27:29;"Yeah, like a Tuesday in like February of like '88."
27:29;27:30;"Pitch black."
27:30;27:34;"Mom is defrosting frozen orange juice."
27:34;27:35;"Oh, like Minute Maid?"
27:35;27:36;"Yeah."
27:36;27:40;"'80s was like peak bad food."
27:40;27:43;"Frozen orange juice in this like, I can still picture it."
27:43;27:47;"It's in like a stainless steel pitcher that she's mashing up."
27:47;27:49;"Because it comes out and it's just like the shape of the can."
27:49;27:52;"Yeah, mashing it with like a wooden spoon and stirring it."
27:52;27:55;"And then the Lenders bagel in the toaster oven."
27:55;27:57;"And I just put butter on it."
27:57;28:00;"So thinking about those winter mornings and it's still dark,"
28:00;28:02;"it was just like so brutal."
28:02;28:03;"It was [bleep] up."
28:03;28:04;"You know what?"
28:04;28:08;"From the same era or maybe more '90s, it was a little fancier."
28:08;28:11;"But a very rare treat that would really brighten up a dark New England"
28:11;28:17;"winter morning is a nice and toasty Sara Lee croissant coming out the toaster."
28:17;28:18;"You ever have those?"
28:18;28:19;"No."
28:19;28:22;"You know Sara Lee would make frozen croissants."
28:22;28:23;"Frozen?"
28:23;28:25;"What was the point of frozen orange juice?"
28:25;28:27;"Was it cheaper than just buying it fresh?"
28:27;28:32;"Fresh was like not a thing on the market commonly in the '80s, man."
28:32;28:34;"You couldn't go to the supermarket and just get like a--"
28:34;28:35;"Like a Tropicana?"
28:35;28:36;"Really?"
28:36;28:38;"No, that started in the-- I remember that specifically."
28:38;28:39;"Oh my-- really?"
28:39;28:41;"In the '90s, it was like all of a sudden there was like,"
28:41;28:46;"""Oh, wait, you can just buy like a half-gallon carton of Tropicana orange juice"
28:46;28:51;"for like $3.50 or whatever, and it's way better."""
28:51;28:55;"I remember asking my mom like, ""Why didn't we like drink this much better"
28:55;28:57;"orange juice back in the '80s?"""
28:57;28:58;"She's like, ""We couldn't."""
28:58;28:59;"Yeah, wasn't around."
28:59;29:01;"Under Reagan, no such thing."
29:01;29:03;"One thing I've always wondered about orange juice is"
29:03;29:06;"why does it taste so much worse than an orange?"
29:06;29:11;"Even the best not-from-concentrate orange juice does not have that clear,"
29:11;29:14;"gorgeous taste of when you're just like eating fresh orange."
29:14;29:15;"Well, that makes sense."
29:15;29:17;"I mean, you're one degree removed."
29:17;29:19;"You know, orange juice is messed up though."
29:19;29:22;"It's just like drinking-- when we talk about diet stuff,"
29:22;29:25;"that's just like drinking a soda that has like vitamins in it."
29:25;29:26;"Yeah, you can--"
29:26;29:28;"It's just like sugar."
29:28;29:31;"Sincere question from Seinfeld2000."
29:31;29:33;"What about Sunny Delight?"
29:33;29:36;"All right, well, let's talk to Mr. Berkowitz from the Bagel Nook."
29:36;29:39;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:39;29:43;"[phone ringing]"
29:43;29:45;"Hello, how you doing?"
29:45;29:46;"Hey, what's up, David?"
29:46;29:48;"You're on with Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
29:48;29:50;"We understand you also have your wife, Stacey, with you."
29:50;29:51;"That's right."
29:51;29:53;"Hello!"
29:53;29:54;"Hey, guys."
29:54;29:58;"So you guys are the owner/operators of the Bagel Nook in Freehold, New Jersey."
29:58;30:01;"Along with my son, Alex, and my daughter, Jessica,"
30:01;30:03;"does all our Instagram and social media."
30:03;30:05;"Oh, so it's a whole family business."
30:05;30:07;"So it's a family business, yes."
30:07;30:09;"So how long has the Bagel Nook been open?"
30:09;30:12;"We're open about 17 months now."
30:12;30:16;"This is a new venture, and we came out with a home run."
30:16;30:19;"Obviously, we want to talk about the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel"
30:19;30:22;"because we talk about Flamin' Hot Cheetos a lot on this show."
30:22;30:24;"But what initially put the Bagel Nook on the map?"
30:24;30:26;"When we first opened up, me and Alex, my son,"
30:26;30:29;"we said we've got to come out with something with a bang."
30:29;30:31;"So I said, ""Let's do an Oreo cream cheese."""
30:31;30:34;"And then he said, ""Let's do an Oreo bagel."""
30:34;30:37;"And then we're selling the Oreo cream cheese on the Oreo bagel."
30:37;30:40;"And then one day, Alex said to somebody,"
30:40;30:42;"""Hey, you want Oreos in the middle of that?"""
30:42;30:44;"And we called it an Oreo overload."
30:44;30:49;"So once we did that, then it was picked up by BuzzFeed,"
30:49;30:51;"and after it was picked up by BuzzFeed,"
30:51;30:54;"it was picked up by the Today Show and Live with Kelly,"
30:54;30:58;"and it went viral, and that was only about 6 or 8 months ago."
30:58;31:01;"And since then, we're always coming out"
31:01;31:05;"with different types of bagels and different types of cream cheeses."
31:05;31:07;"And, you know, we're always pushing the limits"
31:07;31:11;"to try and do different things and wacky, crazy stuff."
31:11;31:14;"Wow, so I got to ask, since you guys are a new operation,"
31:14;31:16;"you're coming out doing Oreo overload, Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
31:16;31:19;"bagels, Cap'n Crunch bagels, you're all over the place."
31:19;31:22;"What was the bagel scene in the Freehold region like"
31:22;31:23;"before Bagel Nook opened?"
31:23;31:26;"There's no bagel store that does what we do."
31:26;31:30;"We have 30 different wild flavors of cream cheeses."
31:30;31:33;"They try and copy us, but they just don't keep up with it"
31:33;31:36;"because it's very labor-intensive,"
31:36;31:39;"and they don't know the ingredients and the time and labor"
31:39;31:42;"that goes into it, and we're the only game in town"
31:42;31:45;"that does all these crazy things."
31:45;31:50;"We get people from Baltimore, Massachusetts, Manhattan,"
31:50;31:52;"Philadelphia, all over the place."
31:52;31:55;"People travel every single weekend,"
31:55;31:58;"and it's a mob scene in the store. It's great."
31:58;32:00;"So I got to ask, because you're from Freehold,"
32:00;32:02;"have you had a Bruce Springsteen visit yet?"
32:02;32:06;"We did not have a Bruce Springsteen visit yet,"
32:06;32:07;"and I just can't wait."
32:07;32:09;"I know it's going to happen."
32:09;32:13;"I just, two hours ago, finished his book,"
32:13;32:15;"and it's the best, best book."
32:15;32:16;"Growing Up, New Jersey."
32:16;32:17;"Oh, it's a great book, yeah."
32:17;32:19;"Huge, huge Springsteen fan."
32:19;32:21;"I'm just waiting for him to come in."
32:21;32:25;"We have a poster on the wall from, like, 1971"
32:25;32:27;"of the original members of the band,"
32:27;32:30;"and it's just, you know, I'm just waiting."
32:30;32:31;"If I see Bruce at the Grammys,"
32:31;32:33;"that's the one thing I'm going to say to him."
32:33;32:34;"Tell him to come to the Nook, man."
32:34;32:35;"Get your ass down to the Nook."
32:35;32:37;"Get your ass to the Nook."
32:37;32:39;"All right, so obviously you guys have the kind of"
32:39;32:41;"wacky stuff on lock."
32:41;32:45;"Can I come through and just get a sesame bagel"
32:45;32:46;"with a schmear?"
32:46;32:47;"Absolutely."
32:47;32:49;"We're a full bagel deli."
32:49;32:52;"We do pancakes, stuffed French toast,"
32:52;32:54;"regular French toast, pork roll egg and cheese,"
32:54;32:58;"bacon egg and cheeses, salads, a full line of boar's head."
32:58;32:59;"Oh, wow."
32:59;33:02;"Yeah, we're soups, salads, sandwiches."
33:02;33:03;"We're everything."
33:03;33:06;"We're just known for all the wacky stuff also."
33:06;33:08;"Okay, so speaking of the wacky stuff,"
33:08;33:11;"we just tried the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagels."
33:11;33:14;"Does this actually contain the Frito-Lay's product,"
33:14;33:15;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos?"
33:15;33:16;"Yes, it does."
33:16;33:18;"Okay, so can you walk us through the process?"
33:18;33:20;"Obviously, you don't want to give up any trade secrets,"
33:20;33:21;"but how do you make these?"
33:21;33:24;"It's really a red and orange bagel"
33:24;33:28;"that's hand-twisted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos in it."
33:28;33:29;"So they're in the dough."
33:29;33:32;"They're in the dough, and they're on the outside."
33:32;33:35;"But what happened before the Flamin' Hot Cheeto,"
33:35;33:38;"to get to that, I think about a month ago, two months ago,"
33:38;33:42;"I wanted to do a ghost chili pepper cream cheese."
33:42;33:44;"That's like an incredibly hot pepper."
33:44;33:46;"The hottest chili out there."
33:46;33:50;"So I couldn't find it to buy because nobody carries it,"
33:50;33:51;"but I just had it in my mind."
33:51;33:54;"I want to do a ghost pepper chili cream cheese."
33:54;33:58;"So there's one food market that's close by."
33:58;33:59;"They have it."
33:59;34:00;"It's in dried form."
34:00;34:03;"And I'm like, ""Holy mackerel, I'm going to buy this."
34:03;34:05;"I'm going to finally try and make it."""
34:05;34:07;"So I buy it."
34:07;34:08;"We make it."
34:08;34:12;"It's super, super, super spicy, but it's delicious."
34:12;34:14;"So I said to Alex, I said,"
34:14;34:16;"""We've got to come up with something that goes with this."""
34:16;34:18;"We do a Dorito bagel."
34:18;34:19;"Oh, wait, wait, sorry, just real quick."
34:19;34:22;"With a Dorito bagel, are we talking Cool Ranch?"
34:22;34:23;"Nacho cheese."
34:24;34:27;"The Dorito bagel is a straight-up nacho cheese Dorito bagel,"
34:27;34:29;"which really is delicious."
34:29;34:30;"Straight up."
34:31;34:33;"And then after that, not too far after that,"
34:33;34:36;"we said, ""Let's do the Flaming Hot Cheeto."""
34:36;34:37;"So we did the Flaming Hot Cheeto,"
34:37;34:40;"paired it with the ghost pepper cream cheese."
34:40;34:41;"Ah."
34:41;34:43;"Oh, it's so good, I can't tell you."
34:43;34:46;"But also, for those that don't want to go hot hot,"
34:46;34:50;"we made a Cool Ranch cream cheese to go with it."
34:50;34:51;"Oh."
34:51;34:52;"I know."
34:52;34:53;"There's such a variety."
34:53;34:54;"That's wild."
34:54;34:55;"Great, yeah."
34:55;34:56;"So I'm just curious,"
34:56;34:57;"were you in the food services industry"
34:57;34:59;"when the family started this business?"
34:59;35:00;"I was not."
35:00;35:04;"My son, actually, Alex went to two years of Johnson & Wales."
35:04;35:07;"Before high school, he worked in a bunch of bagel stores."
35:07;35:10;"He went to Johnson & Wales in Rhode Island."
35:10;35:13;"He partied a little bit too much."
35:13;35:14;"Oh."
35:14;35:16;"Yep, neglected the grades."
35:16;35:19;"He was asked to leave and bring up the grades,"
35:19;35:21;"and he'll be allowed back."
35:21;35:23;"So my wife and I said, ""You know what?"
35:23;35:25;"""We're not going to waste the money"
35:25;35:27;"""that you're partying too much."
35:27;35:29;"""Go to a community college,"
35:29;35:31;"""and we'll look for a business,"
35:31;35:33;"""'cause Alex is so passionate."""
35:33;35:37;"And this was his dream from when he was, like, 16 years old,"
35:37;35:38;"and we knew he wanted to do it,"
35:38;35:41;"and we took a long time to find a bagel store."
35:41;35:43;"And we just said, ""You're not going to go back to school."
35:43;35:45;"""We'll just put the money into a business."""
35:45;35:47;"And we finally found something,"
35:47;35:51;"and we took it over, and the rest is history."
35:51;35:53;"So if you could estimate"
35:53;35:56;"how many Flamin' Hot Cheetos are in a bagel..."
35:56;35:57;"Ah, good question."
35:57;36:00;"Do you have to buy, like, bags and bags and bags"
36:00;36:01;"of Flamin' Hot every week?"
36:01;36:02;"You're not saying enough."
36:02;36:06;"It's bags and bags and bags and bags and bags and bags"
36:06;36:07;"and then more bags."
36:07;36:09;"What are we talking here in terms of volume?"
36:09;36:13;"We're talking probably, like, 30 bags a weekend."
36:13;36:15;"Is it your best seller? What's your best seller?"
36:15;36:18;"Oreos are best seller, and what we've decided to do"
36:18;36:21;"is take the Oreo bagel with Oreo cream cheese"
36:21;36:26;"and Oreos inside, and Alex decided to deep fry it."
36:26;36:29;"So he puts it in some type of batter"
36:29;36:32;"and throws the whole thing into the fryer,"
36:32;36:37;"and it comes out with this warm, crusty crunch on the outside,"
36:37;36:40;"and inside, the cream cheese starts to ooze,"
36:40;36:42;"and everybody loves that."
36:42;36:44;"Oh, wow. This is fully a dessert item."
36:44;36:46;"Is that a breakfast item?"
36:46;36:48;"People do it for breakfast all the time."
36:48;36:49;"Oh, no. Whoo!"
36:49;36:51;"So are you guys ever at the shop--"
36:51;36:52;"what time do you guys open?"
36:52;36:55;"6 o'clock to 3 o'clock, 7 days a week."
36:55;36:57;"Oh, wow. Yeah, I guess a bagel place has to open early."
36:57;36:59;"So you're ever there, it's like 6.15,"
36:59;37:01;"a construction worker comes in and says,"
37:01;37:04;"""Let me get the deep-fried--"" what's it called? Oreo--"
37:04;37:05;"Overload."
37:06;37:07;"""Let me get a deep-fried Oreo overload"
37:07;37:10;"and a cup of black coffee,"" and you're just like, ""Wow."""
37:10;37:13;"It's not as sweet as people think."
37:13;37:14;"It's just, like, delicious."
37:14;37:16;"People get such great reactions from it."
37:16;37:19;"They're so surprised from-- that it's not as sweet"
37:19;37:20;"as you think it is."
37:20;37:22;"'Cause of the cream cheese, right? Is that why?"
37:22;37:25;"The cream cheese, yeah. Oh, I know why, sure."
37:25;37:26;"It's--"
37:26;37:28;"I just can't tell you why."
37:28;37:31;"Oh. It sounds like you need a nap afterwards."
37:31;37:32;"You do."
37:32;37:33;"I grew up in New Jersey."
37:33;37:35;"I'm a little further north than you guys,"
37:35;37:37;"and being from the East Coast, you know,"
37:37;37:39;"I love a good bagel, but I also do--"
37:39;37:41;"I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures--"
37:41;37:43;"I also like to go to Dunkin' Donuts sometimes"
37:43;37:44;"and get an egg and cheese there."
37:44;37:47;"As a small business owner, what's your take on Dunkin'?"
37:47;37:49;"What's my take on Dunkin'?"
37:49;37:52;"We have a delicious-- we have a full coffee bar."
37:52;37:55;"So, first of all, I'm a Starbucks kind of guy."
37:55;37:56;"My wife is a Starbucks girl."
37:56;38:00;"And they're all both in the same shopping center as us."
38:00;38:02;"Yeah, there's really zero comparison,"
38:02;38:04;"because our bacon, egg, and cheeses"
38:04;38:06;"and our porkloin, egg, and cheeses,"
38:06;38:07;"they're all made fresh."
38:07;38:09;"You know, they're not put in the microwave or anything."
38:09;38:11;"But so how does that make you feel"
38:11;38:15;"if you see a consumer comes in holding a venti from Starbucks"
38:15;38:16;"and ordering a bagel from you?"
38:16;38:17;"Do you ever just want to say to them,"
38:17;38:19;"""Come on, our coffee's good, too."
38:19;38:20;"We're a one-stop""?"
38:20;38:23;"No, not at all. Everything's all good."
38:23;38:26;"If people want to bring in Starbucks, bring in Starbucks."
38:26;38:29;"Sometimes I drink my caramel macchiato in the store,"
38:29;38:31;"so it's all good."
38:31;38:32;"Oh, really?"
38:32;38:33;"Yeah, it's all good."
38:33;38:34;"I like that you guys are mellow."
38:34;38:35;"We're totally mellow,"
38:35;38:38;"and the people of Freehold are so, so nice."
38:38;38:39;"Where'd you grow up?"
38:39;38:40;"I grew up in Glen Ridge."
38:40;38:42;"It's up kind of closer to Newark."
38:42;38:44;"Yeah, that's by Tenafly, right?"
38:44;38:46;"Yeah, not too far from Tenafly, one county over."
38:46;38:49;"Yeah, you're only about 40 minutes from us."
38:49;38:50;"No, yeah."
38:50;38:51;"Next time I'm over at my parents' house,"
38:51;38:53;"I'd love to take them down and check out the Nook."
38:53;38:54;"Do you guys do merchandise?"
38:54;38:58;"We have T-shirts, and we ship nationwide."
38:58;38:59;"If you go to the website,"
38:59;39:02;"there's a link for clicking, and it's Goldbelly."
39:02;39:05;"And we ship nationwide, too."
39:05;39:06;"Oh, you know, one last question."
39:06;39:07;"And, Jake, I'm curious."
39:07;39:08;"This was a nationwide thing."
39:08;39:11;"I remember growing up in northern New Jersey"
39:11;39:13;"where you got a lot of bagel shops,"
39:13;39:14;"and you got a lot of Irish people."
39:14;39:19;"Since I was a little kid, every single St. Paddy's Day,"
39:19;39:21;"we would eat green bagels in school."
39:21;39:22;"Do you have green bagels in Connecticut?"
39:22;39:23;"Oh, yeah."
39:23;39:26;"So you guys must do green bagels on St. Patrick's Day, right?"
39:26;39:28;"We absolutely do green bagels,"
39:28;39:31;"and this year we're going to be shipping them nationwide."
39:31;39:34;"And I'm going to come out with a cream cheese."
39:34;39:35;"I can't say it right now"
39:35;39:37;"because I don't want to put it out there,"
39:37;39:39;"but when I make it, if you want,"
39:39;39:40;"I'll get back in touch with you,"
39:40;39:43;"and I'll give you a first dip at what it is."
39:43;39:46;"But I have, like, two cream cheeses"
39:46;39:47;"that are going to blow you away."
39:47;39:48;"Okay, I can't wait."
39:48;39:51;"Maybe closer to St. Paddy's Day, you could call in again."
39:51;39:52;"I absolutely will."
39:52;39:54;"Where are you shipping to?"
39:54;39:59;"We ship to Arizona, Florida, Hawaii a couple times."
39:59;40:00;"Oh, wow."
40:00;40:02;"All over, all over."
40:02;40:03;"That's incredible."
40:03;40:04;"It's crazy."
40:04;40:07;"We're just riding this and enjoying the moment."
40:07;40:09;"I mean, we're talking to you guys."
40:09;40:11;"The media is just getting in touch with us."
40:11;40:15;"It's just a fantastic, great thing for my son, my daughter,"
40:15;40:16;"even for us."
40:16;40:18;"Yeah, I mean, it's a great story."
40:18;40:19;"That sounds amazing."
40:19;40:21;"The whole family can get together, do something like that."
40:21;40:23;"Well, thanks so much, David and Stacey."
40:23;40:25;"Send our regards to the kids,"
40:25;40:27;"and congratulations on the success of the bagel nut."
40:27;40:29;"We'll definitely be in touch again."
40:29;40:30;"Okay, thanks."
40:30;40:31;"And when you're in town,"
40:31;40:34;"please come in, have breakfast and lunch on us."
40:34;40:35;"Oh, amazing."
40:35;40:36;"I'm coming through."
40:36;40:37;"All right, have a good one, guys."
40:37;40:38;"Got it."
40:38;40:39;"Thank you so much."
40:39;40:40;"All right, bye-bye."
40:40;40:41;"Bye."
40:42;40:43;"In the day we sweated out on the streets"
40:43;40:45;"of a runaway American dream"
40:45;40:49;"That night we racked the mansions of glory"
40:49;40:52;"in suicide machines"
40:52;40:55;"Sprung from cages on Highway 9"
40:55;41:01;"Torn with human jacket and stepping out over the line"
41:01;41:05;"Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back"
41:05;41:08;"It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap"
41:08;41:11;"We gotta get up while we're young"
41:11;41:18;"'Cause tramps like us, baby, we were born to run"
41:18;41:26;"Yes, born to run"
41:26;41:31;"When you let me in, I wanna be your friend"
41:31;41:34;"I wanna guard your dreams and visions"
41:34;41:37;"Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims"
41:37;41:40;"And strap your hands 'cross my engines"
41:40;41:44;"Together we could break this trap"
41:44;41:46;"We'll run till we drop"
41:46;41:49;"Baby, we'll never go back"
41:49;41:53;"Oh, you'll walk with me out on the wire"
41:53;41:57;"'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider"
41:57;42:00;"But I gotta know how it feels"
42:00;42:02;"I wanna know if love is wild"
42:02;42:07;"And I wanna know if love is real"
42:09;42:12;"We'll get up and we'll show"
42:15;42:18;"Up, down, up"
42:36;42:39;"Beyond the palace, heavy baritone"
42:39;42:42;"Scream down the boulevard"
42:42;42:46;"Girls comb their hairs and we give you mirrors"
42:46;42:49;"And the boys try to look so tough"
42:49;42:53;"The amusement park ride before the start"
42:53;42:56;"And kids are up on the beach in the mist"
42:56;42:59;"I wanna die with you and me on the street tonight"
42:59;43:03;"And another western kiss"
43:30;43:33;"The highway's jammed with broken heroes"
43:33;43:36;"Not a last chance power drive"
43:36;43:39;"Everybody's out on the run tonight"
43:39;43:43;"But there's no place left to hide"
43:43;43:46;"Together with me we can live with the sadness"
43:46;43:52;"I'll love you with all the madness in my soul"
43:52;43:56;"Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when"
43:56;44:00;"We're gonna get that boy, girl, you really wanna go"
44:00;44:04;"And walk in the sun, but to win chance like us"
44:04;44:09;"Baby, we were born to run"
44:09;44:11;"Oh, honey, chance like us"
44:11;44:15;"Baby, we were born to run"
44:15;44:17;"Come on and win me, chance like us"
44:17;44:22;"Baby, we were born to run"
44:46;44:51;"Beats 1, Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis"
44:51;44:53;"Wow, what a call. So what do you think, Jake?"
44:53;44:54;"Was that our best call ever?"
44:54;44:55;"Yeah, by far."
44:55;44:57;"That was definitely the best call ever."
44:57;45:00;"Enough politics. I think talking to local, small business owners"
45:00;45:01;"is the way forward."
45:01;45:03;"I gotta say, that made me a little homesick."
45:03;45:04;"Yeah?"
45:04;45:07;"Hearing a real Jersey guy and a Jersey gal on the phone."
45:07;45:09;"I love that it's a family business."
45:09;45:14;"I've often fantasized about if I ever leave radio,"
45:14;45:18;"that I might..."
45:18;45:21;"There's something about running a small daytime business."
45:21;45:23;"I've never wanted to have a bar."
45:23;45:25;"Some people always dream about opening a bar."
45:25;45:27;"I always liked something about a coffee shop,"
45:27;45:29;"and now I'm thinking, like, bagel place."
45:29;45:30;"Regular daytime hours."
45:30;45:31;"Yeah, and I wouldn't mind that much."
45:31;45:33;"I mean, I think that's a really beautiful thing."
45:33;45:39;"You and your wife and the kids roll over, open up at 6 a.m."
45:39;45:41;"I like that, that you're helping people start their day,"
45:41;45:43;"serving them coffee and bagels."
45:43;45:45;"Definitely good for them."
45:45;45:46;"They got enthusiasm."
45:46;45:49;"It's rare that the whole family can get together in a business."
45:49;45:53;"I remember one of my dad's good friends growing up,"
45:53;45:56;"he and his wife opened a donut and coffee shop"
45:56;45:58;"in a strip mall near my house."
45:58;46:00;"It was called Kim's Coffee."
46:00;46:02;"It was named after their daughter, Kim."
46:02;46:04;"And so she would reluctantly do shifts there"
46:04;46:06;"when she was, like, you know, 17."
46:06;46:07;"And would you go?"
46:07;46:09;"Yeah, I'd go down there with my dad on, like, a Sunday morning."
46:09;46:12;"So this is, like, a '90s mom-and-pop Connecticut."
46:12;46:13;"So what was the vibe?"
46:13;46:15;"Is it, like, fluorescent lighting?"
46:15;46:16;"Was it cozy?"
46:16;46:19;"No, it was--yeah, it lasted three or four years."
46:19;46:22;"It was not a smash hit."
46:22;46:26;"And maybe part of that was the ambiance or lack thereof."
46:26;46:29;"But I do remember going down there, like, one Sunday morning,"
46:29;46:33;"like, early with my dad at, like, 7-15 or something"
46:33;46:35;"and, like, hanging out in the back"
46:35;46:36;"where they were making the donuts."
46:36;46:38;"And I'd never seen donuts or even thought about"
46:38;46:40;"how donuts were made."
46:40;46:44;"And there was just this giant vat of grease."
46:44;46:46;"And then he was just, like, peeling off--"
46:46;46:48;"so he had, like, the donut batter."
46:48;46:51;"He was, like, forcing it through this, like, chute."
46:51;46:53;"And he would, like, drop these, like,"
46:53;46:57;"basically round batter balls into this--"
46:57;46:58;"The boiling--"
46:58;46:59;"Boiling grease."
46:59;47:00;"Was it unappetizing?"
47:00;47:01;"A little bit."
47:01;47:02;"Great donuts, though."
47:02;47:05;"Should we look at some of these listener questions?"
47:05;47:06;"Oh, yeah."
47:06;47:09;"So first, let's get Seinfeld 2000 on the mic for a second."
47:09;47:10;"Hey-o."
47:10;47:11;"Hey, what's up?"
47:11;47:15;"First of all, I wanted to congratulate you."
47:15;47:17;"I think you got those Time Crisis"
47:17;47:18;"Twitter account numbers up."
47:18;47:19;"I want to check right now."
47:19;47:21;"Yep, we're fully viral."
47:21;47:25;"So I think last week we were at, like, around 2,500?"
47:25;47:28;"Yeah, about 2.5K."
47:28;47:31;"For a variety of reasons."
47:31;47:35;"I haven't been on Twitter all that much lately."
47:35;47:37;"I'm trying to make this album."
47:37;47:40;"I'm trying to take in what's happening--"
47:40;47:42;"the awful events of the world around me--"
47:42;47:45;"in a measured, sane way where I can process it."
47:45;47:47;"So I haven't been on Twitter all that much."
47:47;47:49;"So I haven't seen all of your tweets, which I love."
47:49;47:51;"I love that you're just doing your thing over there."
47:51;47:52;"Wow, OK."
47:52;47:53;"You crossed the 5,000 threshold."
47:53;47:54;"Congratulations."
47:54;47:55;"Thank you."
47:55;47:56;"Yeah, I'm just crushing it."
47:56;47:58;"You are a hell of a social media manager."
47:58;47:59;"Well, thank you very much."
47:59;48:00;"I also want to tell you guys--"
48:00;48:02;"this is going to be a bad story because I don't want to, like,"
48:02;48:04;"say where-- but the other day I was having lunch,"
48:04;48:07;"and Kelsey Grammer was in the restaurant."
48:07;48:09;"Why don't you want to say where?"
48:09;48:11;"I don't want people to know where I go to."
48:11;48:13;"Was it Cafe Nervosa?"
48:13;48:14;"Cafe 101?"
48:14;48:16;"I'll say it was in Los Angeles."
48:16;48:17;"What was Kelsey's vibe?"
48:17;48:18;"And also, I don't want to put him on blast."
48:18;48:20;"I don't want people to know where Kelsey goes to."
48:20;48:23;"So when Kelsey goes into a restaurant like that,"
48:23;48:25;"do you think the waiter has to, like, restrain--"
48:25;48:30;"is it herself not to ask if he's going to get the tossed salad?"
48:30;48:32;"Because that's all I would be thinking."
48:32;48:34;"If Kelsey ever came to my diner--"
48:34;48:35;"Ezra's Place."
48:35;48:38;"Whatever-- if he came to Ezra's Place, whatever he ordered--"
48:38;48:43;"he'll be like, well, Niles, I'll have the Denver omelet"
48:43;48:44;"and a side of bacon."
48:44;48:47;"The waiter comes back, and I'm like, we're bringing this full-tossed salad"
48:47;48:48;"and scrambled eggs."
48:48;48:51;"I don't give a--"
48:51;48:54;"Anyway, it was nice that after we talked so much about Frazier last time"
48:54;48:58;"that I got to at least briefly bask in the glow of the man himself."
48:58;48:59;"That's cosmic."
48:59;49:04;"Okay, so Seinfeld 2000, you requested people to ask some questions."
49:04;49:08;"Yeah, I said something like, you know, everybody respond to this tweet"
49:08;49:10;"with questions for Ezra and Jake."
49:10;49:11;"And you know what?"
49:11;49:13;"People didn't disappoint."
49:13;49:16;"Okay, so these are-- you picked out your favorites that I have printed out here?"
49:16;49:17;"Yeah."
49:17;49:19;"Okay, so I'm going to start."
49:19;49:23;"Jake, from @MotherJossMisty, wow, I hope--"
49:23;49:25;"you know, I've seen some of these names before."
49:25;49:27;"Forgive me if I'm not saying it correctly."
49:27;49:29;"You never really know how to say somebody's Twitter handle"
49:29;49:31;"because you'd normally just type it."
49:31;49:35;"If you had to eat one flavor of chips for the rest of your life, what would it be?"
49:35;49:38;"That is a tough one."
49:38;49:39;"Like a pita chip?"
49:39;49:40;"Something really chow."
49:40;49:42;"Oh, wow, something boring."
49:42;49:43;"Yeah."
49:43;49:44;"All right, fair enough."
49:44;49:48;"Okay, Ezra, this is from @BennyBijoux."
49:48;49:51;"Hey, guys, I'm a huge ABBA fan, and I've always wondered"
49:51;49:54;"why you chose ""One of Us"" as the opener for the show."
49:54;49:56;"Oh, great question."
49:56;49:59;"I always loved that song, and I always--"
49:59;50:01;"I don't know, I just knew it had a good intro."
50:01;50:04;"Every time I would hear that cinematic intro,"
50:04;50:07;"I would just picture a radio host speaking over it."
50:07;50:10;"So I don't know, I just kind of felt like that'd be good to talk over"
50:10;50:14;"and then just like, ""Bum, ba-bum, bum."""
50:14;50:19;"Jake, @BandsAndPlants, which had better music, 1970s or 1980s?"
50:19;50:20;"'70s."
50:20;50:22;"Wow, I didn't even have to think."
50:22;50:23;"No, that's obvious."
50:23;50:27;"@TonDog is wondering, Ezra--"
50:27;50:28;"Yeah."
50:28;50:32;"--will you team up with the Chainsmokers on LP4?"
50:32;50:33;"Wow, all right."
50:33;50:34;"Or would you? How about that?"
50:34;50:35;"Or would I?"
50:35;50:37;"Well, I don't know. They asked, ""Will you?"""
50:37;50:42;"I'm going to amend it slightly and say, if they reached out to you, would you?"
50:42;50:44;"I would definitely sit down and break bread with those guys."
50:44;50:46;"I respect what they do."
50:46;50:48;"I'm always interested in picking somebody's brain, getting to know somebody,"
50:48;50:50;"even if they're from a different genre."
50:50;50:54;"I will say, to the fans who are listening,"
50:54;51:00;"after having written, I think, the vast majority of the songs for LP4 so far,"
51:00;51:04;"very few of them are in a Chainsmokers vein,"
51:04;51:07;"which either means that that's what the album's missing--"
51:07;51:08;"Right."
51:08;51:09;"--or that they could bring some of that over here."
51:09;51:13;"Maybe LP5 is the one to team up with the Chainsmokers on."
51:13;51:14;"Doesn't quite feel right."
51:14;51:15;"I like that."
51:15;51:16;"Jake--"
51:16;51:17;"Yeah."
51:17;51:20;"--this one's from @JuliePilot, who actually works at Beats--"
51:20;51:21;"Oh, OK."
51:21;51:22;"--a radio OG."
51:22;51:27;"If you were to live outside of America, what country would you live in?"
51:27;51:28;"Jeez."
51:28;51:29;"You're such an all-American guy."
51:29;51:32;"That's a tough one."
51:32;51:33;"Let's just make it specific."
51:33;51:34;"Yeah."
51:34;51:38;"All expenses paid, but you got to go two years in another country."
51:38;51:39;"Your bags are packed."
51:39;51:40;"The PJ's waiting for you."
51:40;51:41;"I need an answer right now."
51:41;51:42;"London."
51:42;51:43;"Yeah."
51:43;51:45;"Speak in English."
51:45;51:46;"[LAUGHS]"
51:46;51:48;"I wasn't even thinking that."
51:48;51:49;"No, but I mean, that's a good--"
51:49;51:51;"From my line of work, what I-- yeah."
51:51;51:52;"I don't know."
51:52;51:53;"I've always liked London."
51:53;51:54;"No, you gave a pragmatic answer."
51:54;51:55;"I haven't been there in a long time."
51:55;51:58;"I've always had an affinity for it."
51:58;51:59;"Yeah."
51:59;52:05;"@JakeMcKay asks, if you could make any product flaming hot, what would it be and why?"
52:05;52:07;"It doesn't have to be food."
52:07;52:09;"Oh, any product."
52:09;52:10;"Like a shower curtain?"
52:10;52:11;"A car?"
52:11;52:12;"Yeah."
52:12;52:13;"Oh, you know what?"
52:13;52:18;"You know how a lot of people have the fancy hand soap now that's all grainy?"
52:18;52:19;"Oh, this is tight."
52:19;52:20;"Yeah."
52:20;52:21;"[LAUGHS]"
52:21;52:26;"I would make flaming hot, and it would kind of like rub your skin raw a little bit and"
52:26;52:28;"leave you kind of like your fingers tingling."
52:28;52:29;"It's like lava."
52:29;52:30;"You know that lava soap?"
52:30;52:31;"Yeah, lava was like the OG."
52:31;52:32;"Yeah, yeah."
52:32;52:33;"My dad had that in the basement bathroom."
52:33;52:34;"Yeah."
52:34;52:35;"Just like coming home from work."
52:35;52:36;"Yeah."
52:36;52:38;"But now there's like the Aesop fancy ones, or if you get a nice restaurant, they have"
52:38;52:39;"like the grainy one."
52:39;52:40;"Yeah."
52:40;52:41;"So I'd do a flaming hot hand soap."
52:41;52:48;"@Ezra @MotherJawMisty asks, Ezra, have you seen that photo of you at the SAG Awards looking"
52:48;52:49;"lost?"
52:49;52:50;"It's very funny."
52:50;52:51;"Yes, I've seen that picture."
52:51;52:52;"What is that?"
52:52;52:53;"Screen Actors Guild?"
52:53;52:54;"What is that?"
52:54;52:55;"It's the Screen Actors Guild Award."
52:55;52:56;"Oh, OK."
52:56;52:57;"I went to the SAG Awards as a plus one."
52:57;52:58;"And I wasn't there to do press or anything."
52:58;52:59;"So I roll with the crew."
52:59;53:00;"The people I were were actually actors in the guild."
53:00;53:01;"So we get there, they're going to do press."
53:01;53:02;"It's one of the most awful places to be and stressful."
53:02;53:03;"All these people, all these people that are like, ""Oh, I'm going to be in this."""
53:03;53:04;"And I'm like, ""No, I'm not going to be in this."""
53:04;53:05;"And I'm like, ""I'm not going to be in this."""
53:06;53:32;"And I'm like, ""I'm not going to be in this."""
53:32;53:36;"So I was just making a beeline and I guess I got caught in the back of a picture of some"
53:36;53:38;"of the people from the Big Bang Theory."
53:38;53:39;"I don't think you look lost, man."
53:39;53:41;"You look like James Bond or something in that."
53:41;53:44;"I'm just like, ""Huh?"""
53:44;53:49;"Jake, at Bands and Plants, what is that one thing/memory that always makes you laugh when"
53:49;53:50;"you think about it?"
53:50;53:54;"Wow, Bands and Plants is up in this."
53:54;53:55;"Asking the deep ones."
53:55;53:57;"Oh, geez."
53:57;54:01;"That's a tough one."
54:01;54:02;"What's a pleasant memory?"
54:02;54:08;"Yeah, like what's something that's always funny?"
54:08;54:09;"Big Lebowski."
54:09;54:11;"Yeah, that's true."
54:11;54:17;"Like doing lines from Lebowski with my buddy Kyle."
54:17;54:19;"That's not really a memory."
54:19;54:21;"What about you and your brother?"
54:21;54:23;"Siblings always have old school jokes that..."
54:23;54:24;"Okay."
54:24;54:29;"I think I was telling you this the other night."
54:29;54:34;"My brother and I, because we listened to the oldie station all the time growing up."
54:34;54:37;"My mom loves the music of the '60s, but the oldie station would play '60s and then it"
54:37;54:45;"would get into pretty innocuous '70s pop or get into Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, really"
54:45;54:47;"bottom of the barrel, top 40 stuff."
54:47;54:51;"My brother and I would figure out what song she hated and then we would sing them in the"
54:51;54:52;"backseat of the car."
54:52;54:53;"Just to mess with her."
54:53;54:58;"Young girl, get out of my mind."
54:58;54:59;"Stop it boys."
54:59;55:00;"Yeah."
55:00;55:03;"My love for you is way out of..."
55:03;55:04;"Guys!"
55:04;55:09;"Something about that warms my heart."
55:09;55:13;"Another one from Anne, or Anne, @BandsAndPlants."
55:13;55:17;"Oh God, this is a real question."
55:17;55:21;"How can we get Americans to take climate change seriously and make lifestyle changes to help"
55:21;55:22;"prevent it?"
55:22;55:23;"Okay."
55:23;55:26;"Now I'm glad we had one serious question."
55:26;55:30;"So everybody should check out this Naomi Klein book from a couple of years ago."
55:30;55:33;"It's shocking and depressing, but also it gives you some hope."
55:33;55:37;"It's called This Changes Everything, Capitalism Versus the Climate."
55:37;55:39;"And she really explains, gets to the heart of it."
55:39;55:44;"Why would Koch brothers and all these right-wing billionaires and people put so much money"
55:44;55:46;"towards convincing people it's not real?"
55:46;55:52;"And the answer is fairly simple, is that they see attempts by the government to limit the"
55:52;55:56;"burning of fossil fuels or these things that affect the environment as also limiting the"
55:56;55:59;"unfettered growth of their businesses."
55:59;56:03;"So they've put so much money into convincing just regular people who really have no horse"
56:03;56:06;"in the game, who are probably only going to suffer because of this."
56:06;56:11;"So it's kind of shocking how organized the enemy is."
56:11;56:14;"How can we convince Americans to make lifestyle changes?"
56:14;56:15;"I mean, you're probably right."
56:15;56:19;"Like, unfortunately, the best way to deal with these big things is for the government"
56:19;56:22;"to set limitations on how much you can pollute."
56:22;56:27;"The US wouldn't even agree to make sure that the planet doesn't get more than a few degrees"
56:27;56:28;"hotter."
56:28;56:30;"We're having a really hard time on a global scale."
56:30;56:32;"How do you get people to do it?"
56:32;56:38;"I mean, the brutal answer, it would have to be continued climate disasters."
56:38;56:40;"And it might be too late by that point."
56:40;56:45;"By the time that we, already in our lifetimes, we've seen horrific things happening like"
56:45;56:48;"Hurricane Katrina and stuff."
56:48;56:52;"And it would probably have to be like nonstop, even bigger events."
56:52;56:56;"And by the time people were like, okay, let's do something about this."
56:56;56:57;"It might be too late."
56:57;56:59;"So what do you think, Jake?"
56:59;57:03;"Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, not eat meat."
57:03;57:04;"That's a big one."
57:04;57:05;"Right."
57:05;57:06;"That's a good place to start."
57:06;57:12;"You know, when you look at that stuff, how much water and also fossil fuels go into creating"
57:12;57:13;"like a pound of beef."
57:13;57:15;"Yeah, it's ridiculous."
57:15;57:18;"And all the methane that cows fart out and burp out."
57:18;57:19;"It's insane."
57:19;57:20;"It's like actually a real thing."
57:20;57:24;"I almost think that like, this is kind of messed up to say, but I almost think that"
57:24;57:28;"like most people deep down don't care."
57:28;57:29;"Yeah."
57:29;57:38;"I wonder if you could like straight up just say to everybody in America, either you stop"
57:38;57:46;"eating meat, or your great great grandchildren are going to die horrific deaths in like a"
57:46;57:51;"post apocalyptic like famine."
57:51;57:56;"Would people be like, well, you know, to actually picture people you're never going to meet."
57:56;58:02;"Just like water world, Mad Max, the road."
58:02;58:04;"Just living that way."
58:04;58:06;"Would people really just be like, all right, I won't eat meat."
58:06;58:13;"I bet future generations will look back at our time and be like, what monsters."
58:13;58:19;"They knew what was happening, but they couldn't get their act together to do anything."
58:19;58:20;"They're monsters."
58:20;58:21;"It's real bad."
58:21;58:29;"You've got an open heart, so you share what's inside, thinking that all is said in confidence,"
58:29;58:30;"but then you realize..."
58:30;58:37;"This sun is beating heavy, this cold is breaking my bones."
58:37;58:38;"This cold is incredibly unsteady."
58:38;58:38;"It's over."
58:38;58:45;"I'm not going to be like the other monsters."
58:45;58:46;"It's over."

01:07:38;01:07:40;"I think he has a unique touch."
01:07:40;01:07:48;"But it's true, the '81, that seems right around the year when country music was fully dead."
01:07:48;01:07:52;"I mean, fully merged into pop."
01:07:52;01:07:57;"One interesting thing about this single is that it topped all four of Billboard's singles"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"charts."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Wow."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Which back then, I just want to point this out, back then the four singles charts they"
01:08:03;01:08:08;"were the Hot 100, of course, they still have that, Country, Adult Contemporary, and Top"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Black Singles."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"That was the name of it?"
01:08:12;01:08:16;"Yeah, for a long time there was a chart that was called the Top Black Singles."
01:08:16;01:08:24;"But it's funny, so this song, I guess they thought that this belonged in all four categories."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"Well, they thought it belonged in all four categories?"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"No, I mean it was."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Or just organically sold?"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"Well, I don't know how it measured."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"I mean, were they actually monitoring?"
01:08:33;01:08:37;"That would have been crazy if they were actually monitoring the consumers."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"If you're black and you buy it, it goes to the top single charts."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"If you're white and southern, it goes to the country."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"Well, maybe it was on the radio, on the country stations."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"I thought it was just sales, I don't know."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"That is bonkers."
01:08:48;01:08:51;"Yeah, and this is already in the '80s."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Wow."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Not a great song."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"Terrible song."
01:08:58;01:09:04;"Let's get a little palate cleanser with a superior song from our times."
01:09:04;01:09:13;"This one's Justin Bieber, ""Love Yourself,"" nominated for Song of the Year."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"Is there like a predisposition to awarding ballads?"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"How come these are all ballads?"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"This is debatably a ballad."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Well, compared to his other material."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Yeah, you might be right."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"I mean, maybe-"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Like melodramatic, kind of heavy."
01:09:31;01:09:36;"Right, maybe if they want to award songwriters, they want to be like, ballads have more gravitas."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Right."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Yeah, and I bet you're right."
01:09:39;01:09:44;"I bet you're going to see less fun club songs."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Right."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"Like, who's to say-"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"I doubt Nelly was nominated for ""It's Getting Hot in Here."""
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Right."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Even though it's probably-"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Better than this song."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Or tied."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Or whatever was-"
01:09:54;01:09:55;"Tied for best."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Well, whatever was nominated that year, whatever the year that was."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"No, I'm sure you're right."
01:10:00;01:10:03;"I probably, there was a sense of like, that the committee would be like, ""Oh, 'Hot in"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"Here,' that's not Song of the Year potential."""
01:10:05;01:10:06;"That's a fun song."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"You know, don't get me wrong."
01:10:07;01:10:12;"It's a fun song, a few witty lines, but that's a party song, versus like, why?"
01:10:12;01:10:16;"Why can't a party song be as well-written as-"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Harder to write a good party song."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"It is harder, I agree."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"I got ballads for days."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"They're easy."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"That's the hard, that's why it takes a long time to finish an album, is because you've"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"got to write the fast songs."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"It's a pro tip."
01:10:28;01:10:34;"One fun thing about this, similar to Lionel Richie writing ""Lady"" for Kenny Rogers, Ed"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"Sheeran wrote this song for Justin Bieber."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"Oh, okay."
01:10:38;01:10:43;"You know, it's nice to see pop stars helping each other out, collaborating."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"I don't mind the song."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"No, this is a good song."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"I like the voicings on the chords."

01:16:02;01:16:04;"This is probably gonna win, I would guess."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Wait, are you up for song or record?"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Album."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Oh, album."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Record is song."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"No."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Song is for the songwriters."

01:18:43;01:18:46;"And maybe like an orchestra."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"Remember when Metallica made their orchestral album?"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Metallica's a trip to think about because in the '80s,"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"they were like scary."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"Yeah."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"And they had no interest in appealing to the mainstream"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"or being liked."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"And it's like at some point, maybe after the Black album,"
01:19:00;01:19:04;"they were just like, ""We'll do anything."""
01:19:04;01:19:07;"So sort of like--I mean, I'm not really bagging on them."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"They did it."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"No, they did it."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"They have cred."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"And even like some of the post-haircut music was good."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"Was it?"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Yeah, I mean, I don't know."
01:19:17;01:19:21;"I'm not like--I'm not trying to be all neg-head on Metallica."
01:19:21;01:19:26;"It's just like maybe just--my memory of them as a kid was like--"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"They went back to scary speed metal."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"Right, but it was no longer scary."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"These guys have hundreds of millions of dollars and ride horses,"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"so of course they're not going to be quite as scary."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"The only way for a person with hundreds of millions of dollars"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"to be scary is by doing like Koch Brothers stuff."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Are you running for president?"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Yes, running for president."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"Hey, Hetfield, if you really want to scare us again, run for president."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"Yeah, that's next level."
01:19:51;01:19:55;"Can you still tell me, see, Hetfield, Libertarian Party?"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Hetfield Johnson."
01:19:58;01:20:02;"He would totally--he would have that kind of like--that like Joe Rogan,"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"like Dilbert."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Totally, totally."
01:20:04;01:20:07;"Where they'd be like, ""So what do you think of--imagine if he's in this race."""
01:20:07;01:20:13;"He'd think like, ""So, all right, Hillary Trump, who's better?"""
01:20:13;01:20:20;"Honestly, I'd love to smack the sh-- out of both of them."
01:20:20;01:20:23;"I got no time for either."
01:20:23;01:20:27;"Just two sides of the same coin, man."
01:20:27;01:20:31;"Yeah, but then unable to articulate what that means."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"What do you mean?"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I mean--"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"You're literally saying that Hillary's as bad as Trump?"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"Yep."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Why?"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"They're all part of the same system."
01:20:40;01:20:43;"Part of the same system, man."
01:20:43;01:20:47;"Anyway, Adele plus Metallica."
01:20:47;01:20:52;"I was just handed a piece of paper, it would be Modelica."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"Maybe get Modelo in on that, too."
01:20:55;01:20:58;"Modelo presents Modelica."
01:20:58;01:21:06;"They'd make like special nine-ounce cans of Modelica."
01:21:06;01:21:07;"Oh, man."
01:21:07;01:21:12;"That is such a type of dude, like a Hetfield dude who's just like all part of the same system, man."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"You totally right about the Rogan fan base, too."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"They're both scumbags."
01:21:19;01:21:26;"I mean, you know that we're--we don't love the Democrats on Time Crisis."
01:21:26;01:21:33;"But at the same time, you just got to shake your head at that, just like hardcore, just like--"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"They're both--"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"That's so lame."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"We got to like--"
01:21:39;01:21:44;"Like you can talk about what the problem is with the Republicans and the--but I mean, come on."
01:21:44;01:21:51;"I bet there's still--like even today, the Hetfields will be like, ""Trump, he's no good, man."""
01:21:51;01:21:56;"But I'm honestly terrified to see what the Democrats are going to come with in 2020."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"That's why I'm running."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"Terrified?"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"I feel bad imagining all this about Hetfield."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"He's probably just like a chill dude."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"I actually listened to Hetfield on Maron a few weeks ago."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Oh, yeah? He's like a sensitive guy."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Yeah, he was chill."
01:22:08;01:22:13;"Like I think they skirted around politics."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"And he was sort of like--"
01:22:15;01:22:18;"You know what's funny? Like people also forget these dudes are from San Francisco."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Oh, dude. Actually, well, check this out, man."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"This came up in the interview."
01:22:21;01:22:29;"He and his family left San Francisco and moved to like rural Colorado and live in some like huge property in rural Colorado."
01:22:29;01:22:34;"And he was sort of like, ""I started to feel pretty uncomfortable around San Francisco."""
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Oh, no."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Yeah, it was a little bit like--"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Is that like coded homophobia?"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"No, it wasn't homophobia."
01:22:38;01:22:46;"He was just sort of like, ""You know all the political correctness, you know, like guy like me."""
01:22:46;01:22:48;"It was a little vague."
01:22:48;01:22:54;"I think he was sort of just like, ""Listen, I like to hunt and like shoot guns and like drive big SUVs."""
01:22:54;01:22:55;"Right."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"All good. Whatever."
01:22:57;01:23:04;"It's not like Metallica, at least that I can think of, was ever like had sexist or racist lyrics."
01:23:04;01:23:05;"I mean maybe I'm wrong."
01:23:05;01:23:12;"Like their brand of like offensiveness was more just like, ""Death to civilization."""
01:23:12;01:23:13;"Yeah."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"Like I don't know. There's no left-wingers."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"""Blackened to begin the dance of the dead."""
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Like that's some real '80s--"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:23:21;01:23:28;"--like, ""Oh, the PC police don't like it when we sing about darkness imprisoning us."""
01:23:28;01:23:30;"Nobody cares, man."
01:23:30;01:23:37;"It was interesting to think about San Francisco awash in like tech money and like being the most liberal city in the country."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"Oh, yeah."
01:23:38;01:23:41;"Like him feeling out of step with like--and I think he was living in Marin County."
01:23:41;01:23:45;"And actually, dude, I have a Metallica SUV story."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Really?"
01:23:46;01:23:50;"Because I used to live in San Francisco and I used to deliver groceries out of the Whole Foods at Franklin in California."
01:23:50;01:23:55;"And Kirk Hammett, the lead guitarist, would always come in to that Whole Foods."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"I'd see him there all the time."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"And he drove this like huge white Escalade."
01:23:59;01:24:05;"And the garage underneath the Whole Foods was so tiny, like San Francisco style."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"You know, like super hard to maneuver and like you had to like back into every space."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"And he had this ginormous white Escalade."
01:24:12;01:24:22;"I remember him coming like within like an eighth of an inch this time of like just scraping the entire side of his white Escalade against this like concrete pillar."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"I mean, that's cool he still wants to go buy his groceries in person."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"That's true."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"I wish I delivered to him."
01:24:28;01:24:32;"Mr. Hammett, I hope I'm not overstepping, man."
01:24:32;01:24:35;"But you're always coming in here driving your beautiful white Escalade."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"You're coming awful close to scratching that thing up."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I just want to introduce myself."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"My name is Jake Longstrip."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"I work for Shop Hoppers."
01:24:44;01:24:48;"I'm a delivery associate at Shop Hoppers."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"And I do live."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Marin County is within our area."
01:24:53;01:24:59;"I think I can make your life a whole heck of a lot easier, Mr. Hammett."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Kirk always seemed like a real nice guy."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Yeah, seemed like a real sweetheart."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Yeah, he's the sweet one."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"Anyway, Grammys."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Missed opportunity."
01:25:10;01:25:16;"I'm going to be shaking my head tonight when I watch Lady Gaga take the stage with Metallica."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"What are they going to do?"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"What are her songs?"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Probably a mashup."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"I don't know."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"Isn't that pretty cool?"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"[singing]"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Say your prayers, little one."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"Oh, I hope they don't do that."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"That'll suck."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"I mean, great song, but it's like--"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Her singing, yeah."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"She's got great songs."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"I wish they did early stuff, man."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"Well, their new stuff is like speed metal again."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Is it?"
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Yeah."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"It's good?"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"It's good."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Okay."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Adele's probably going to win."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"That's my pick."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Yeah, yeah, I feel you."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Back to 1981."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"We got Barbra Streisand with ""Woman in Love."""
01:25:54;01:25:56;"What a funny--"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Yeah."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"I mean--"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"We've had Midler and Streisand."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"Midler, Streisand, Kenny Rogers."

01:26:32;01:26:33;"Oh, this is a good one."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"You know this song?"

01:27:11;01:27:12;"Yeah."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Oh, wait, this is just like that Britney Spears song."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"Or I was thinking--"

01:27:52;01:27:55;"They're always going back to old songs and studying the melodies."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"I mean, he could get sued for that."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"It's pretty damn close."
01:27:58;01:28:01;"I'd never recommend musicians suing each other because it's--"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"No, no, no, I wasn't saying that."
01:28:03;01:28:08;"I just think you're going to ruin Britney Spears' day just to get Barbra Streisand another few mil."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Well, she didn't write it."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Did she?"

01:28:18;01:28:19;"Oh, okay, yeah, she was--"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"That makes a hell of a lot of sense."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"She was real mobbed up with the Bee Gees in that era."

01:29:56;01:29:57;"It's like the strange sound."

01:39:10;01:39:14;"So anyway, this Posner song gives me the same kind of vibe."

01:39:16;01:39:21;"a depressed, alienated, successful rock star, but--"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Well, I like--"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"I'm not buying all these--"

01:40:12;01:40:15;"So who knows? Maybe he wrote a few big hit songs."
01:40:15;01:40:19;"Maybe he's got more money than the average person can dream of."
01:40:19;01:40:23;"Like $5 million in the bank, and he's relatively young."

01:48:30;01:48:32;"Okay."

01:48:52;01:48:55;"like, do the Grammys reflect true artistry or whatever?"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"It's imperfect, but if you look at generally who wins"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"some of the big categories,"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"they tend to be respected artists, at least lately."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Like, whatever."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Beck,"
01:49:07;01:49:10;"they all--they're respected artists-ish."
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Yeah."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Well, yeah, but I mean, whatever."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Like, the Christopher Cross of our day"

01:49:16;01:49:17;"Whatever."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Yeah, I see what you're saying."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"His sweep winning all four of the big categories"

01:49:21;01:49:22;"That's crazy."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"His record was undeniably popular,"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"eventually going quintuple platinum."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"That's five times platinum."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"And he scored a bona fide hit in sailing."
01:49:31;01:49:34;"His meteoric rise from struggling, soft-spoken Texas songwriter"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"to the top of the charts made his story a fascination"

01:49:39;01:49:40;"something's already a hit,"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"but then now truly everybody knows about it."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"So everybody's talking, ""Who's Christopher Cross?"""
01:49:45;01:49:48;"Grandma's asking, ""Who's Christopher Cross?"""
01:49:48;01:49:51;"Yet his success inspired the critics' ire."
01:49:51;01:49:55;"They pointed to the awarding of his self-proclaimed pop and roll."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"I guess he kind of played himself,"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"calling his music pop and roll."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"The critics aren't going to like that."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"So the critics pointed to it as the Academy's failure"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"to recognize artistically innovative"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"and critically acclaimed pop music."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"Critics argued that it was commercial pandering,"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"an attempt on behalf of the Academy"
01:50:12;01:50:15;"to generate momentum for a new market segment,"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"adult contemporary."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"So I guess you look at other stuff that came out in like 1980."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"I mean, what's happened in 1980?"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"Talking heads, remaining light, Clash,"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"all sorts of like cool post-punk stuff."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"That stuff never is going to win, right?"
01:50:30;01:50:33;"Aren't the Grammys like sort of known"
01:50:33;01:50:37;"as sort of by the industry for the industry?"
01:50:37;01:50:38;"Well, you know--"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"I feel like you joked about this."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"It'd be like if the Oscars was like,"
01:50:41;01:50:44;"""Best picture, Transformers 4."""
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Well, not quite."
01:50:45;01:50:51;"I mean, like, the Grammys maybe has a weirder track record."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"I think the Grammys has a better track record than the Oscars."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"I was actually just talking about this to somebody."
01:50:55;01:50:59;"Like, the Oscars is like such a narrow idea"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"of what a great movie is."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"The Grammys mess up from time to time,"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"but like in the '70s, for instance,"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"the decade just preceding this one,"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"like Stevie Wonder won like two or three times."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"So like you had like the--"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"you know, in the '80s, like Paul Simon Graceland, I think, won."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"Outcast has won."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"It's like the Grammys occasionally gets it like dead wrong,"
01:51:19;01:51:23;"but also sometimes they do find that nexus of like"
01:51:23;01:51:26;"something that's like legitimately the people love."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"That's sold a ton."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"But it's also artists and like, I don't know."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Well, that happens with the Oscars too."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"I mean, it happens, you know, sometimes they're way off,"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"sometimes they're on the ball."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"I mean, it happens."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"I just feel like the reputation of the Grammys,"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"it's like more strictly based on like commercial success"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"is the first barometer."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"And it's actually an interesting thing to think about."
01:51:45;01:51:51;"And then the Oscars is more critical in its criteria."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"And sometimes that can be way off."
01:51:54;01:51:59;"Right, because like the Oscars would never like give"
01:51:59;01:52:03;"Step Brothers a nomination, even though most people think"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"Step Brothers is a classic film."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"They don't even have a category to honor comedy."
01:52:07;01:52:10;"At least the Grammys--"
01:52:10;01:52:11;"There's not? That's crazy."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"No, no, no, it's whack."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"That's why comedy classically underperforms at the Oscars."
01:52:17;01:52:22;"At least the Grammys, you know, they have best alternative."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"It gives like a chance for like a Vampire Weekend"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"to like get a Grammy."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"And they have rap categories and R&B categories."
01:52:29;01:52:33;"So at least the genre categories at least make it not impossible"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"to win a Grammy if you're not like some type of--"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"a specific type of artist."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"And then even Album of the Year, like we'll see."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"We'll see who wins today."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"God, that's amazing about Christopher Cross though."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"That is just--"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"Clean sweep."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Has that been done since?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Oh, that's a good question. I don't know."
01:52:48;01:52:54;"But just imagine all the critics just railing on poor Christopher Cross."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"That's really funny."
01:52:55;01:52:59;"And I mean then you go back and you listen to it and you're like,"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"yeah, it's funny how time works."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"Like deep down, I love Talking Heads."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"I love Remain in Light."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Yeah."
01:53:06;01:53:11;"But like I would throw Once in a Lifetime next to Sailing on a mixtape."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"They're both cool."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Yeah."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"But back then it'd be like this sucks."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"This is garbage."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"This is the industry pandering."
01:53:20;01:53:24;"One thing I'll say, whether or not that's true,"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"I'm willing to believe that Christopher Cross put just as much thought,"
01:53:27;01:53:34;"heart and soul and artistry into Sailing as David Byrne put into Once in a Lifetime."
01:53:34;01:53:38;"That's a deep mystery."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Maybe more."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"You're saying he's as sincere as David Byrne?"
01:53:41;01:53:46;"I'm just saying like the critics back then maybe were like mad at the"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Recording Academy and they were like,"
01:53:48;01:53:53;"you're just rewarding this like gross thing to try to sell more records to like"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"aging consumers."
01:53:55;01:54:00;"But putting that aside, whatever crassness there might be within the industry,"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"in terms of artistry, I'm just saying that as a man,"
01:54:04;01:54:09;"Christopher Cross put just as much thought, soul, emotion into this song."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Probably maybe even more."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"I would say more emotion."
01:54:11;01:54:14;"Yeah, well, David Byrne is known to be not the most emotional guy."
01:54:14;01:54:17;"I would say less thought and more emotion."
01:54:17;01:54:23;"In fact, it was David Byrne's detachment that made him a more revered artist"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"in the eyes of critics."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Right."
01:54:25;01:54:30;"You know, because David Byrne singing the lyric,"
01:54:30;01:54:33;"""The canvas can do miracles."""
01:54:33;01:54:37;"The canvas can do, yeah, I mean."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"Anyway, Sailing, Song of the Year, 1981."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"We'll see."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Wow."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Who wins in 2017."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Wow."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"We'll find out very soon."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"I'm liking this '81 vibe though."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Yeah, '81 is an interesting time."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"It's a transitional moment for the country."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Yeah."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Just like now."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"All right, well, let's wrap things up, Jake."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Yeah."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"That was a hell of a show, man."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Yep, we got into it."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"We really started your 40s with a bang."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"We talked about life."
01:55:05;01:55:11;"We talked about bagels with the Berkowitz family of Freehold, New Jersey."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"We talked about the Grammys."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"We talked about training regimens."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Yeah."
01:55:18;01:55:24;"Man, it was probably not a good idea to house a Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"How's that sitting?"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"The day of the Grammys."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"I liked it."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"It's fine."
01:55:29;01:55:36;"You're going to be launching some gross Flamin' Hot Cheetos burps at the Grammys."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Yeah, maybe I should just stay home."
01:55:38;01:55:41;"You know what, I'm going to go home, just do a real quick 10 push-ups."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Nice, dude."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"Get pumped up."
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Get the blood flowing."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"That's right."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"I'll be good."
01:55:47;01:55:52;"As always, it's been nice to spend a couple hours on Sunday afternoon"
01:55:52;01:55:58;"taking a slight break from the horror show of the times we're living in."
01:55:58;01:56:02;"Oh, the canvas can do miracles."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"Yeah, I like sailing because there's this dark undertone to it"
01:56:05;01:56:10;"where it's kind of just like it's about fantasizing about just sailing,"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"you know, take me away."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Right."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"But it's also like there's a darkness there."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"Yeah, that could cut either way."
01:56:16;01:56:20;"Like, you know, it's like a haunting song."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"I love those arpeggios."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"See you later, Time Crisis listeners."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:56:26;01:56:29;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
