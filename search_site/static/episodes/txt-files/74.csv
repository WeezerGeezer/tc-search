00:05;00:08;"Time Crisis, reunited once again."
00:08;00:11;"On today's episode, we talk about cold brew."
00:11;00:13;"What is it? Does it taste sour?"
00:13;00:15;"We'll talk to the experts."
00:15;00:20;"Jake and I also talk about Jason Alexander, a.k.a. George Costanza's star turn"
00:20;00:23;"as Colonel Sanders in the new KFC ad."
00:23;00:27;"All this, plus we count down the hits of 2018 and 1999."
00:27;00:31;"This is a very cold brew episode of..."
00:31;00:35;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:35;00:37;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
00:37;00:39;"One."
01:22;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. Jake, what's up, man?"
01:25;01:26;"It's been a minute."
01:26;01:29;"It has been a minute. I've been all over the place."
01:29;01:31;"Australia, Japan, Chicago."
01:31;01:32;"Do tell."
01:32;01:35;"It was funny. We went to Australia and Japan, and it's like a long tour."
01:35;01:37;"It was a two-week tour with two shows."
01:37;01:39;"Yeah, I remember we discussed this."
01:39;01:42;"All the gear routing was a bit of a headache."
01:42;01:43;"Rocket cargo."
01:43;01:44;"Right."
01:44;01:49;"In Australia, our keyboardist, Will ""Buckethead"" Canzanare, didn't have the real piano."
01:49;01:50;"Where was it?"
01:50;01:55;"I guess they had to ship the piano to Japan, so he did MIDI piano in Australia."
01:55;01:57;"Do you guys ship a real piano?"
01:57;01:58;"Apparently."
01:58;01:59;"That's wild."
01:59;02:00;"We're shipping a freight anyway."
02:00;02:02;"Might as well throw a piano on there."
02:02;02:04;"Yeah. It's not that much bigger than everything else."
02:04;02:05;"How were the shows?"
02:05;02:06;"They were both tight."
02:06;02:08;"I mean, it's a little funny."
02:08;02:14;"I think I said this on the last episode or one episode about, you know, we booked these shows way in advance."
02:14;02:16;"Festivals book almost a year early."
02:16;02:17;"That's wild."
02:17;02:18;"So you're doing a lot of guesswork."
02:18;02:20;"Will the album be done?"
02:20;02:21;"We're going to be ready to play new stuff."
02:21;02:22;"You hope so."
02:22;02:27;"So all things considered, that we're not playing any new material, they're going really well."
02:27;02:28;"Were people giving you guff?"
02:28;02:30;"No. People seemed psyched."
02:30;02:33;"And, you know, we got all the new musicians, and we're playing some stuff differently,"
02:33;02:34;"and we're having fun."
02:34;02:39;"So, you know, I think given that we're in a kind of weird interim period, we're still putting on a good show."
02:39;02:40;"Undoubtedly."
02:40;02:43;"I caught a good 45 minutes of the Chicago show."
02:43;02:44;"Oh, on the live stream?"
02:44;02:45;"Live stream."
02:45;02:46;"Oh, man."
02:46;02:49;"Saturday night, I was driving Hannah's Prius."
02:49;02:50;"Really?"
02:50;02:53;"Down to go see Sorry to Bother You at the Hollywood Arclight."
02:53;02:54;"Oh, tight."
02:54;02:55;"Got caught in some traffic."
02:55;02:57;"That's just what was on?"
02:57;03:00;"Caught like a -- I was like, I'm just going to hang with this."
03:00;03:02;"Solid 40 minutes."
03:02;03:03;"Wow."
03:03;03:07;"I mean, it's really stressful to me that we have to do all these festivals that have live streams."
03:07;03:12;"Because sometimes even more people watch/listen to the streams than are even there."
03:12;03:15;"And there's a part of me that's like, I can't monitor the mix."
03:15;03:19;"Bayo told me that the live stream of Yahe sounded like shreds."
03:19;03:20;"I actually caught that."
03:20;03:21;"Because that's like --"
03:21;03:22;"He said it sounded insane."
03:22;03:23;"That was the closer, right?"
03:23;03:24;"It was towards the end."
03:24;03:29;"But it's because we have like all these effects on his mic because he's singing Yahe, and it goes like, Yahe!"
03:29;03:34;"That mic that's all f**ked up was picking up the bass, so apparently just like driving everything insane."
03:34;03:38;"I wondered about that because his bass sounded crazily out of tune."
03:38;03:41;"And I was like, there's no way his bass is actually out of tune."
03:41;03:44;"I know. These are the things that happen with live streams."
03:44;03:46;"And they just drive me crazy."
03:46;03:47;"But whatever. You live and you learn."
03:47;03:49;"And hopefully people are as charitable as you."
03:49;03:53;"Oh, sweet thing."
03:53;03:56;"Zion doesn't love you."
03:58;04:01;"Babylon don't love you."
04:01;04:06;"But you love everything."
04:06;04:14;"Oh, you saint."
04:14;04:17;"America don't love you."
04:17;04:22;"So I could never love you."
04:24;04:28;"And spout up everything."
04:28;04:36;"In the dark of this place, there's the glow of your face."
04:36;04:41;"There's the dust on the screen of this broken machine."
04:41;04:46;"And I can't help but feel that I made some mistake."
04:46;04:51;"But I let it go. Yahe, Yahe, Yahe."
04:51;04:55;"Through the fire and through the flames."
04:55;05:06;"You won't even say your name."
05:06;05:16;"Through the fire and through the flames."
05:16;05:18;"You won't even say your name."
05:18;05:22;"Only I know that I'm"
05:22;05:26;"Who could ever live that way."
05:26;05:30;"What we all way."
05:30;05:34;"I ask what you, you."
05:34;05:35;"Lollapalooza was great."
05:35;05:37;"That one was a little more nerve-wracking."
05:37;05:39;"'Cause the other ones were like, you know, in other countries."
05:39;05:42;"Lollapalooza's first time back on American soil."
05:42;05:43;"Post Ojai."
05:43;05:44;"Post Ojai's."
05:44;05:45;"Post, uh."
05:45;05:47;"We did all these little shows."
05:47;05:49;"Regional SoCal shows."
05:49;05:52;"It was our first time back on American soil at a festival."
05:52;05:53;"People amped."
05:53;05:54;"And again with no music."
05:54;05:55;"I mean, well, here's the thing."
05:55;05:56;"Yes, people were amped."
05:56;05:57;"The crowd was crazy."
05:57;05:59;"We've always had great fans in Chicago."
05:59;06:02;"But again, in the years since we've been gone,"
06:02;06:07;"rock went from being played out to almost being non-existent."
06:07;06:09;"A shovel full of dirt on that coffin."
06:09;06:10;"Exactly."
06:10;06:12;"I feel like five years ago,"
06:12;06:15;"it was like a funny debate people would have about is rock dead?"
06:15;06:17;"And now people don't even want to talk about it."
06:17;06:19;"And then, you know, when you're a musician,"
06:19;06:21;"you hear through the grapevine all the festivals happening,"
06:21;06:22;"you hear these horror stories."
06:22;06:25;"I'm not going to name names, but like somebody will say to me,"
06:25;06:29;"""Did you hear that that band that you liked, they were up against?"""
06:29;06:30;"That DJ."
06:30;06:32;"That DJ, that rapper, whatever."
06:32;06:33;"And I'm like, ""Okay."
06:33;06:35;"Well, that sounds like a good choice."""
06:35;06:38;"People who want to see that, they're like, ""It was harsh, man."
06:38;06:41;"Crowd didn't even make it to front of house."""
06:41;06:43;"Front of house is just like the front?"
06:43;06:45;"No, front of house is where the sound guy is."
06:45;06:46;"Okay."
06:46;06:48;"So you know at a festival, there's always like a little tent where the--"
06:48;06:49;"Right."
06:49;06:50;"So that's like a pretty good--"
06:50;06:52;"That's like back like 100 feet or something."
06:52;06:53;"Maybe even farther."
06:53;06:54;"Yeah."
06:54;06:56;"But it also means that for the person on stage,"
06:56;06:59;"like we're at Lollapalooza, I couldn't see where the crowd ended."
06:59;07:01;"It might have ended just past where I could see,"
07:01;07:04;"but at least I'm looking out and I'm just kind of like, ""Okay."""
07:04;07:06;"So anyway, I've just been hearing things like, you know,"
07:06;07:09;"it can be tough out there for the aging rock band."
07:09;07:12;"The shins didn't get their front of house."
07:12;07:14;"I didn't say that."
07:14;07:15;"They're up against The Weeknd."
07:15;07:16;"We were against The Weeknd."
07:16;07:18;"The Weeknd mopped the floor with the shins."
07:18;07:20;"That was also funny is that we were up against The Weeknd."
07:20;07:21;"At the same time?"
07:21;07:22;"Literally the same time."
07:22;07:23;"Wow."
07:23;07:26;"We're a mile apart, either side of Grant Park, and we're just there."
07:26;07:27;"And I was kind of into it."
07:27;07:28;"A mile? Wow."
07:28;07:30;"No, that's how Lollapalooza works."
07:30;07:33;"They have two headliners, although one's always kind of like the real headliner"
07:33;07:34;"and one's like the second headliner."
07:34;07:35;"Yeah."
07:35;07:37;"So, you know, you get these like funny pairings."
07:37;07:40;"Like the night before is like The National versus Bruno Mars,"
07:40;07:42;"and we're Vampire Weekend versus The Weeknd."
07:42;07:43;"Wow."
07:43;07:46;"And also there was like this big DJ Zedd was playing at the same time."
07:46;07:48;"It was like a pretty stacked lineup."
07:48;07:50;"So three people going at the same time."
07:50;07:51;"Probably even more."
07:51;07:52;"Weekend versus Weekend."
07:52;07:54;"It was Weekend versus Weekend, which I found kind of interesting."
07:54;07:55;"Yeah."
07:55;07:57;"And, you know, I was also a little nervous because, like, obviously,"
07:57;07:59;"we're not here with like a whole new show."
07:59;08:01;"We're not even playing any new material."
08:01;08:02;"And then on top of that--"
08:02;08:03;"This oldies act."
08:03;08:05;"Oldies act Vampire Weekend."
08:05;08:08;"And then on top of that, you know, we got like some new shredders,"
08:08;08:13;"letting Brian Jones get into some Santana [bleep] on New Dorp."
08:13;08:14;"I heard that, dude."
08:14;08:15;"He's a shredder."
08:15;08:17;"He's starting to stretch out a little bit."
08:17;08:22;"Yeah, because I caught three shows live, and he seemed pretty restrained."
08:22;08:25;"And it seems slowly but surely he's coming out of that shell."
08:25;08:26;"He's coming to his own."
08:26;08:27;"Yeah."
08:27;08:31;"And also it's like funny, too, how it's kind of like the pop model."
08:31;08:34;"It's like when a pop star comes back, it's kind of like,"
08:34;08:36;"""Welcome to the new era."
08:36;08:38;"Lady Gaga's back."""
08:38;08:43;"And this time she's into robots and dominatrix [bleep]"
08:43;08:47;"whereas like at the end of the album it's like 1950s Betty Draper."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah, exactly."
08:48;08:49;"Okay."
08:49;08:52;"And, of course, I connect to that in some ways as an artist,"
08:52;08:53;"but we're also just a band."
08:53;08:55;"You know, we're like a group of people who play music."
08:55;08:56;"Right."
08:56;08:58;"So there's also--with us there's like this feeling of like"
08:58;09:02;"this new crew of musicians, we've played seven shows together."
09:02;09:03;"Right."
09:03;09:05;"From a performing perspective, as far as a band goes,"
09:05;09:07;"you know, it's not like in Ojai we were kind of just like,"
09:07;09:09;"""Welcome to the new era."""
09:09;09:12;"I mean, unless you say the new era is about being laid back and having fun."
09:12;09:14;"For me it's like we played seven shows."
09:14;09:17;"We'll probably hit our stride like April 2019."
09:17;09:18;"You know what I mean?"
09:18;09:20;"Yeah, I was going to say like show 30."
09:20;09:22;"Yeah, especially once we got to learn the new stuff."
09:22;09:24;"You're like a baseball team, man."
09:24;09:25;"You need like spring training."
09:25;09:26;"Yeah, exactly."
09:26;09:27;"You're not warmed up yet."
09:27;09:28;"It's not even opening day."
09:28;09:29;"Exactly."
09:29;09:31;"The record's not out."
09:31;09:32;"I know, but--"
09:32;09:34;"It's a long season, guys."
09:34;09:35;"We're on an old-fashioned timeline."
09:35;09:36;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
09:36;09:41;"Sometimes people apply a certain type of like pop timeline to Rockman."
09:41;09:42;"You're just like--"
09:42;09:43;"Yeah, yeah."
09:43;09:44;"It just doesn't work for us."
09:44;09:48;"Like in some ways I'm glad that the album wasn't done/out by now"
09:48;09:50;"because I'm kind of like, ""You know what? We need our spring training."""
09:50;09:51;"Yeah, it's going to work out."
09:51;09:56;"It's a little funny that spring training is in front of 30,000 to 40,000 people"
09:56;10:00;"at Lollapalooza plus who knows how many people in Priuses around the world."
10:00;10:02;"I know. Hundreds of thousands."
10:02;10:03;"But I'm kind of into that. It's like--"
10:03;10:05;"What's up with that bass?"
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:10;"It's funny to think about people in like every major city"
10:10;10:14;"and smaller secondary tertiary city, small towns all across America"
10:14;10:17;"catching that live stream."
10:17;10:19;"Is that bass?"
10:19;10:23;"I mean, but also that's the kind of shit that I also love in a way."
10:23;10:27;"It's like this is not Lady Gaga's new era coming correct."
10:27;10:28;"It's like we're working the kinks out."
10:28;10:29;"Yeah."

11:13;11:15;"- Seinfeld, you were monitoring some of this."
11:15;11:17;"I saw this way after the fact on ""Time Crisis"""
11:17;11:18;"that we got a little bit of pushback"
11:18;11:21;"for opening with A-Punk three times."
11:21;11:24;"- Yeah, I saw a lot of like music blog type headlines"
11:24;11:27;"like ""Vampire Weekend"" played A-Punk three times"
11:27;11:29;"in the Seinfeld theme and then--"
11:29;11:31;"- So you guys opened, okay, I missed this completely."
11:31;11:32;"- Okay, yeah, yeah, so you were--"
11:32;11:34;"- You opened with-- - You didn't tune it."
11:34;11:34;"- Yeah."
11:34;11:35;"- We opened with A-Punk three times."
11:35;11:36;"- In a row."
11:36;11:37;"- Yeah, and this is an idea"
11:37;11:40;"that I'd had a very long time ago."
11:40;11:40;"Hopefully I don't get in trouble"
11:40;11:42;"for like being too inside baseball."
11:42;11:43;"All of this stuff was speculative"
11:43;11:45;"because you always get festival offers"
11:45;11:47;"even when you're not really out there."
11:47;11:49;"And I remember at some point hearing like,"
11:49;11:51;"""You guys might maybe could play Coachella last year."""
11:51;11:52;"And I was like, ""I don't know."""
11:52;11:53;"And they're like, ""Well, it could be a really good slot."
11:53;11:55;"""You could play before Beyonce."""
11:55;11:57;"It looked like maybe we could have that slot."
11:57;12:00;"And at first I was like, ""That's amazing."""
12:00;12:00;"And then I thought about it, it's like,"
12:00;12:03;"""Oh, no, no, no, that's bad."
12:03;12:05;"""I don't want a Vampire Game playing before Beyonce."""
12:05;12:07;"And then I was thinking, ""Well, what could we do?"""
12:07;12:08;"Say we rushed to get it ready."
12:08;12:10;"What are the types of things that we could do"
12:10;12:11;"without a lot of new music"
12:11;12:14;"and without a lot of money to put on a great show?"
12:14;12:16;"'Cause you put on a great show,"
12:16;12:17;"but you know, it's a very expensive show."
12:17;12:19;"And then I was like, ""Well, what are the types of things"
12:19;12:22;"""that a band can do just with the music?"""
12:22;12:25;"You could extend a song, jam it, that's one thing."
12:25;12:26;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
12:26;12:27;"- Do eight minute Cape Cod."
12:27;12:29;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
12:29;12:30;"- And what's another thing you could do?"
12:30;12:32;"You could play a song multiple times in a row."
12:32;12:33;"Just get people worked up."
12:33;12:34;"I was like, ""Oh, maybe."""
12:34;12:35;"I also kind of like this."
12:35;12:37;"- Just some like weird John Cage,"
12:37;12:39;"like Brian Eno, like conceptual stuff."
12:39;12:41;"- I didn't even think about it that way."
12:41;12:42;"First of all, I just knew that like"
12:42;12:45;"the real Vampire Weekend fans would just get it instantly."
12:45;12:46;"They're just like, ""It's fun."""
12:46;12:46;"- Yeah."
12:46;12:48;"- And there's also a part of me that's also like,"
12:48;12:50;"I kind of resent the idea that you got to roll up"
12:50;12:53;"to a festival putting on like an avant-garde theater show."
12:53;12:55;"Not that there's anything wrong with that."
12:55;12:55;"I'm just kind of like,"
12:55;12:57;"""We're just here to play music, man."
12:57;12:58;"""It's not that serious."""
12:58;13:00;"So I kind of like the idea also"
13:00;13:02;"of opening with our biggest song."
13:02;13:04;"I don't think anybody interpreted it this way,"
13:04;13:05;"but my thought was,"
13:05;13:07;"""A-Punk is our most well-known song."""
13:07;13:07;"Right?"
13:07;13:09;"Historically, when you're an artist playing,"
13:09;13:11;"you hold back on your most well-known song"
13:11;13:14;"until final third, if not the last song."
13:14;13:15;"- Encore."
13:15;13:16;"- And I was like, ""You know what?"
13:16;13:18;"""Vampire Weekend, we got a great catalog."
13:18;13:19;"""I think our catalog's second to none."
13:19;13:21;"""Got three albums of great music."""
13:21;13:23;"So I kind of thought it was funny"
13:23;13:25;"to also just come out so hard in the beginning,"
13:25;13:27;"burn off our best known song,"
13:27;13:28;"almost unlike a dare."
13:28;13:30;"It's like, ""You wanna go watch The Weeknd?"
13:30;13:32;"""Go."""
13:32;13:34;"That's me and my kind of like paranoid mentality."
13:34;13:35;"I don't think it really came across that way,"
13:35;13:37;"but that's kind of what I was thinking."
13:37;13:39;"It's like, ""Oh, the only song you know is A-Punk?"
13:39;13:41;"""Well, 'cause you saw Step Brothers or something?"
13:41;13:41;"""Well, you know what?"
13:41;13:43;"""Here you go, mother(beep)."""
13:43;13:44;"And here's three times."
13:44;13:47;"I'm gonna give it to you three times so you know."

13:48;13:50;"well, (beep) damn it, walk away right now."
13:50;13:51;"But I'll tell you one thing."
13:51;13:54;"You're gonna miss out on a great set, young man."
13:54;13:55;"That was kind of my thinking."
13:55;13:57;"And honestly, it was a difficult way to open the show"
13:57;13:59;"'cause actually it helped me personally"
13:59;14:02;"'cause it felt like, it was kind of like a warmup."
14:02;14:04;"My favorite comment that I saw was like on Instagram"
14:04;14:06;"or something, one of the fans who's at the show said,"
14:06;14:08;"""It's so weird, I was there"
14:08;14:10;"""and I didn't realize they played it three times."""
14:10;14:12;"And I was kind of like, on stage,"
14:12;14:13;"I was kind of like, ""I know what you mean."""
14:13;14:15;"It felt so weird playing it three times."
14:15;14:16;"It's such a short song too."

14:23;14:25;"Also, it's such a short song."
14:25;14:27;"Maybe we should, I wonder why we didn't do that sooner."
14:27;14:30;"- How many pauses did you have between songs, versions?"
14:30;14:32;"- No, no, no more than 15, 20 seconds."

16:10;16:12;"- And so, we're really just getting started."
16:12;16:13;"- So Dick Pix has played about,"

16:16;16:18;"- A significant percentage."
16:18;16:20;"- You know, one thing that I wanted to say on this episode,"
16:20;16:21;"this is apropos of nothing,"
16:21;16:24;"but have you guys ever played West LA Fadeaway?"
16:24;16:25;"- No."
16:25;16:26;"- Do you like that song?"
16:26;16:27;"- Yeah, it's okay, not one of my favorites,"
16:27;16:29;"but it's been in the conversation."
16:29;16:30;"- It's been kicked around?"
16:30;16:31;"- Yeah."
16:31;16:32;"- 'Cause I don't know. - Are you in?"
16:32;16:33;"- Yeah, I've always kind of liked it."
16:33;16:34;"- Throw it on."
16:34;16:37;"- I like that kind of funky side of the Grateful Dead."
16:37;16:38;"But one thing I was thinking about,"
16:38;16:43;"'cause I'm a big fan of Robert Hunter, I'm a lyrics guy."
16:43;16:45;"West LA Fadeaway has one of the most random,"
16:45;16:48;"but also great Grateful Dead lyrics."
16:48;16:53;"Verse two, got a job moving items for the mob."
16:53;16:54;"(laughs)"
16:54;16:55;"Do you know that lyric?"

17:11;17:15;"- I just also love the lyrical world of the dead."
17:15;17:16;"It includes quite a bit."
17:16;17:21;"You know, the American West, kind of mysticism,"
17:21;17:23;"old-timey American history."
17:23;17:25;"But I just love it. - Love of death."
17:25;17:26;"- But the mob."
17:26;17:27;"And there's something else there."
17:27;17:30;"Moving items for the mob."
17:30;17:33;"Even, there's something about him saying items."
17:33;17:34;"Let me skip to that part."
17:34;17:37;"(record scratches)"
17:37;17:41;"- Oh, that's a rough tone."
17:41;17:44;"- There's some better live versions."
17:44;17:45;"- Is this a studio version?"
17:45;17:46;"- Yeah."
17:46;17:47;"- I wonder what the dead's relationship"
17:47;17:50;"with West LA was, specifically."
17:50;17:53;"- Yeah, I wonder if Hunter just bust that out of nowhere."
17:53;17:55;"Or he had his own experience."

18:14;18:15;"- And then there is something,"
18:15;18:17;"because it's Jerry singing,"
18:17;18:21;"then you start to imagine a late '80s Jerry"
18:21;18:23;"actually being some weird truck driver"
18:23;18:25;"who's hauling items for the mob."
18:25;18:26;"- Oh my God."
18:26;18:29;"- Pulling in in some desolate warehouse."
18:29;18:30;"What you got for me, Garcia?"
18:30;18:32;"- Jerry's look was very trucker."
18:32;18:38;"He might be the most trucker-looking dude"
18:38;18:40;"of all iconic rock stars."
18:40;18:41;"- Totally, especially for a band"

18:43;18:45;"Bob Weir, he's not truckin'."
18:45;18:46;"- Yeah."
18:46;18:47;"- Oh, Nick showed me a website"
18:47;18:49;"that thinks that West LA Fadeaway"
18:49;18:52;"was inspired by John Belushi's death."
18:52;18:53;"- Huh, okay."
18:53;18:55;"- Belushi joined the dead on stage at least once,"
18:55;18:59;"singing backup during an encore at a 1980 New Jersey gig."
18:59;19:00;"- That's tight."

19:29;19:31;"I was hanging out with a little crew"
19:31;19:33;"that Ariel and Danielle were out there."
19:33;19:34;"- Oh, cool."
19:34;19:35;"- That was something fun we did in Japan."
19:35;19:37;"Perhaps the wrong territory to choose it,"
19:37;19:40;"but we played Boyz R Back in town,"
19:40;19:41;"and Danielle was on vocals."
19:41;19:44;"- I saw this on the set list, and I'm very intrigued."
19:44;19:46;"- I couldn't tell how big Thin Lizzy was in Japan."
19:46;19:47;"It didn't get a crazy reaction."
19:47;19:50;"Then we played it at the little club show in Chicago,"
19:50;19:52;"and it was like, it went off."
19:52;19:53;"- Really?"
19:53;19:54;"- Just like people yelling the words."

20:12;20:14;"But anyway, during this trip to Japan,"
20:14;20:17;"you know, we had basically a full week off in Tokyo,"
20:17;20:19;"so I was like half comatose from being so jet lagged,"
20:19;20:21;"and it was like this crazy heat wave,"
20:21;20:23;"I guess kind of like globally,"
20:23;20:24;"but in Japan it was super hot, so."
20:24;20:26;"- Oh, global heat wave is--"
20:26;20:27;"- It was, yeah, it's brutal."
20:27;20:28;"- Dark term."
20:28;20:30;"- But so I spent a lot of time walking around"
20:30;20:32;"with Ariel and Danielle and our friend Anya,"
20:32;20:34;"and you know, in Tokyo it's like an amazing city"
20:34;20:35;"just to walk around."
20:35;20:36;"You can literally just walk in and out"
20:36;20:39;"of like vibey stores every day."
20:39;20:40;"CT told me, and I went to it,"
20:40;20:42;"that there's a store called Ripple"
20:42;20:43;"that sold dead shirts."
20:43;20:44;"- Wow."
20:44;20:46;"- So a lot of vintage dead shirts."
20:46;20:47;"- Like exclusively?"
20:47;20:48;"That's what they sell?"
20:48;20:50;"- No, it kind of just veers hippie,"
20:50;20:52;"but it's clearly named after the dead song."
20:52;20:53;"But so we'd be walking around,"
20:53;20:55;"and you drink a lot of coffee."
20:55;20:56;"It's a real coffee culture."
20:56;20:57;"- Okay."
20:57;20:59;"- And it's sometimes how it dawned on me"
20:59;21:01;"that I hate cold brew."
21:01;21:02;"And I was talking about it with them,"
21:02;21:03;"and I was kind of like,"
21:03;21:06;"why is everything cold brew now?"
21:06;21:07;"I just had so many questions about it."
21:07;21:08;"- Okay, grandpa."
21:08;21:10;"- I know, this is like some pretty grandpa (beep)"
21:10;21:12;"and then I get back to LA."
21:12;21:14;"I'm just walking around West LA fade away style."
21:14;21:16;"- Land of cold brew."
21:16;21:18;"- I walked past a, I don't think it was an Exxon,"
21:18;21:19;"but it was some kind of gas station."
21:19;21:21;"There's a big sign, try our cold brew."
21:21;21:22;"- No, dude, 7-Eleven."
21:22;21:23;"- Oh, 7-Eleven has cold brew now?"
21:23;21:24;"- Yeah, I noticed this."
21:24;21:25;"- No, but this was a gas station that I was at."
21:25;21:28;"- After you texted me about the cold brew kick you're on,"
21:28;21:30;"I noticed that like on a billboard."
21:30;21:33;"Well, 7-Eleven, or maybe it was like an AM, PM or something."
21:33;21:36;"- A lot of these places have cold brew now."
21:36;21:36;"- Try our cold brew."
21:36;21:38;"- Everybody's obsessed with cold brew."
21:38;21:39;"And then I was just talking to everybody"
21:39;21:40;"and I was like saying to my friends,"
21:40;21:41;"do you guys like cold brew?"
21:41;21:44;"I think it's worse than regular iced coffee."
21:44;21:46;"And then also you start to find coffee places"
21:46;21:48;"where you ask for an iced coffee"
21:48;21:49;"and they give you a cold brew."
21:49;21:53;"And then I saw like a goofy Instagram post."
21:53;21:55;"It was some like overheard type,"
21:55;21:57;"you know these accounts that do funny things overheard."
21:57;21:59;"And one of them was at a coffee shop."
21:59;22:03;"Somebody said, it was a patron saying to the barista,"
22:03;22:05;"can I have a cold brew?"
22:05;22:07;"And then the barista says, sorry, we're out of cold brew."
22:07;22:08;"Is iced coffee okay?"
22:08;22:10;"And the person says, yeah, honestly,"
22:10;22:11;"I don't know the difference."
22:11;22:14;"Then about a week ago, I emailed the Crisis Crew"
22:14;22:16;"and I said, guys, we gotta do a cold brew episode."
22:16;22:18;"- On board with this."
22:18;22:21;"- So I said, find us some great cold brew guests"
22:21;22:22;"that we can talk to."
22:22;22:26;"And the first person we're gonna talk to is Tim Carman,"
22:26;22:27;"who's a food reporter at the Washington Post"
22:27;22:29;"where he's worked since 2010."
22:29;22:31;"He was the winner of the James Beard Award in 2011"
22:31;22:34;"for food related columns and commentary."
22:34;22:36;"Okay, so it says here he's a food reporter."
22:36;22:38;"It doesn't say that he covers beverages,"
22:38;22:40;"but we'll see if he has anything to say about this."
22:40;22:43;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
22:43;22:46;"(phone ringing)"
22:46;22:48;"- This is Tim."
22:48;22:49;"- Hey Tim, what's up?"
22:49;22:51;"This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
22:51;22:52;"- Hey, how are you?"
22:52;22:54;"- Not bad, excited to talk to you."
22:54;22:56;"So you're a food reporter at the Washington Post."
22:56;22:57;"- That's correct."
22:57;22:59;"- But you also cover beverages?"
22:59;23:02;"- I've made myself something of the coffee experts"
23:02;23:04;"among the food writers at the paper."
23:04;23:07;"- And also in your own life, are you like a coffee fanatic?"
23:07;23:08;"- Oh, big time."
23:08;23:12;"I have got more gadgets than you can imagine."
23:12;23:14;"- So you're making a lot of coffee at home."
23:14;23:17;"- I make coffee every day, usually hot,"
23:17;23:21;"but I've certainly done my fair share of cold brew."
23:21;23:23;"- Well, that's exactly what we wanna talk about."
23:23;23:26;"And we could use a little bit of context"
23:26;23:29;"from somebody who not only is a coffee drinker,"
23:29;23:32;"but also a reporter and somebody who studies this stuff."
23:32;23:33;"I just had this realization"
23:33;23:36;"that cold brew was suddenly everywhere."
23:36;23:38;"I also realized that as it becomes more ubiquitous,"
23:38;23:40;"people kind of will use cold brew"
23:40;23:42;"and iced coffee interchangeably,"
23:42;23:45;"which leads to a lot of miscommunications,"
23:45;23:46;"tragedies at the coffee shop."
23:46;23:48;"- That's rubbing you the wrong way."
23:48;23:49;"- It is rubbing me the wrong way."
23:49;23:51;"So I guess if you don't mind, Tim,"
23:51;23:53;"I think you're gonna have a lot more perspective"
23:53;23:54;"on this than we do."
23:54;23:56;"What's the cold brew story"
23:56;23:59;"and how did it come to kind of take over the world?"
23:59;24:01;"- Well, I think the first thing to realize"
24:01;24:04;"is that cold brew and iced coffee"
24:04;24:07;"are two different processes."
24:07;24:08;"Iced coffee is very simple."
24:08;24:12;"It's just taking hot brewed coffee and putting it over ice."
24:12;24:15;"Conversely, the cold brew"
24:15;24:20;"is a long, steeped room temperature process."
24:20;24:24;"And you can use it, you can do it in a French press,"
24:24;24:26;"which I think a lot of people have already,"
24:26;24:28;"or you can buy one of these contraptions."
24:28;24:32;"One is very popular with coffee shops called a toddy."
24:32;24:35;"And you take a large amount of beans,"
24:35;24:39;"a six to one ratio of water to beans,"
24:39;24:41;"which doesn't sound like a lot,"
24:41;24:45;"but compared to what the ratio is for hot brewed coffee,"
24:45;24:49;"it's a monstrous amount of beans."
24:49;24:52;"And you let that steep for like 12 to 24 hours"
24:52;24:56;"on your counter where it becomes very concentrated liquid."
24:56;25:00;"It'll often be put right in a pitcher"
25:00;25:02;"and put in your refrigerator."
25:02;25:05;"And obviously one of the benefits of that then"
25:05;25:08;"is that you can have coffee available for you"
25:08;25:10;"for like two weeks."
25:10;25:13;"So it has a longer shelf life than fresh brewed coffee."
25:13;25:16;"It's generally considered to be like less acidic."
25:16;25:17;"- That's what drives me crazy, Tim,"
25:17;25:20;"is that most places where I go have cold brew,"
25:20;25:22;"it tastes so sour to me."
25:22;25:23;"That's unusual."
25:23;25:25;"I don't know where you're getting your cold brew from,"
25:25;25:26;"but I'd be curious."
25:26;25:28;"- I don't wanna name names."
25:28;25:30;"- I think most coffee shops,"
25:30;25:34;"they go for a blend because consistency is key, right?"
25:34;25:38;"People want the same cup of cold brew all year long,"
25:38;25:41;"which is hard to do with a single origin coffee"
25:41;25:44;"because A, they're seasonal and they're only available"
25:44;25:47;"for a few months out of the year."
25:47;25:49;"They'll create a blend of beans"
25:49;25:52;"that typically has a natural sweetness to it."
25:52;25:56;"And that's what appeals, I think, to most cold brew drinkers"
25:56;25:59;"is that you've got a drink that's cold,"
25:59;26:01;"which people like during the summer,"
26:01;26:05;"and then it has lower acidity and it tends to be sweet."
26:05;26:08;"I think those are like three of the main points"
26:08;26:11;"of why cold brew has latched on."
26:11;26:15;"- Seinfeld 2000 here, the Starbucks near my home base"
26:15;26:17;"has cold brew on tap,"
26:17;26:20;"much like you would find a beer on tap at a bar."
26:20;26:24;"Why is it on tap and what goes into that process?"
26:24;26:27;"- I'm assuming this is a cold brew nitro."
26:27;26:28;"- Yes, I think it is."
26:28;26:31;"- Oh yeah, what's this nitro (beep)"
26:31;26:35;"- It's basically just cold brew coffee,"
26:35;26:37;"but it's put on nitro."
26:37;26:41;"And what that does is that it inserts a gas into the coffee."
26:41;26:45;"So it gives it a very creamy flavor to it."
26:45;26:47;"There's obviously no cream in it,"
26:47;26:50;"but just because it's injected with gas,"
26:50;26:52;"kind of infused with gas,"
26:52;26:55;"it gives it this really rounded, sweet,"
26:55;26:58;"sort of creamy flavor, which people like."
26:58;27:01;"I don't know about you, but nitro coffee to me also"
27:01;27:04;"just seems to go straight to the bloodstream."
27:04;27:07;"So it's like whatever amount of caffeine"
27:07;27:08;"is in that cold brew,"
27:08;27:11;"it just immediately makes me jittery."
27:11;27:13;"- But theoretically, nitro aside,"
27:13;27:14;"people sometimes talk about cold brew"
27:14;27:17;"as if it's more hardcore than iced coffee."
27:17;27:20;"Is it necessarily stronger or just depends?"
27:20;27:21;"- It's not stronger."
27:21;27:24;"I mean, it's the same cold brew that you would,"
27:24;27:26;"I mean, I'm assuming most coffee shops"
27:26;27:30;"are using the batch that they make for the cold brew."
27:30;27:33;"They're using the same cold brew as the nitro."
27:33;27:34;"Yeah."
27:34;27:38;"So the only difference is that it's infused with this gas."
27:38;27:42;"And I don't know, to call it more hardcore,"
27:42;27:45;"I think maybe it gives you more of a quicker buzz."
27:45;27:46;"Every time I've drank it,"
27:46;27:48;"I've basically had to stop halfway through"
27:48;27:51;"because I just think, and this is just a personal thing,"
27:51;27:54;"this is not based on any sort of science,"
27:54;27:59;"but it makes me loopy within half the drink."
27:59;28:01;"So I guess in that sense, maybe it is more hardcore."
28:01;28:04;"If you're looking for that caffeine buzz, sure."

28:54;28:58;"I would rather house two tall boys of iced coffee"
28:58;28:59;"from Coffee Bean."
28:59;29:02;"At the end of the day, I'm gonna be floating on air,"
29:02;29:04;"even if it took me a little bit longer, but I don't know,"
29:04;29:07;"there's something about just like a big iced coffee."
29:07;29:09;"It just goes down easier for me."
29:09;29:10;"And that's what's so confusing to me,"
29:10;29:13;"this idea of cold brew actually having a smoother flavor"
29:13;29:14;"or something, maybe I'm just weird."
29:14;29:16;"But also, I don't know, Tim,"
29:16;29:17;"if this is a full East Coast thing,"
29:17;29:20;"definitely I remember in New York, when I was a teenager,"
29:20;29:23;"there was a thing that I would hear family members"
29:23;29:26;"and like my parents' friends say a lot, which was that,"
29:26;29:27;"and this is a little bit before"
29:27;29:29;"the whole third wave coffee boom,"
29:29;29:30;"but they would always say,"
29:30;29:31;"a lot of people go buy their fancy beans"
29:31;29:34;"at a little artisanal bean store,"
29:34;29:36;"but you know where it really has great coffee?"
29:36;29:37;"Dunkin' Donuts."
29:37;29:40;"- Do you remember this, Tim, do they have that down in DC?"
29:40;29:44;"- Oh yeah, they used to spin that BS about Dunkin' Donuts,"
29:44;29:47;"and even earlier, my father used to say"
29:47;29:49;"that McDonald's had the best coffee."
29:49;29:51;"- That's the dark ages."
29:51;29:52;"- Yeah."
29:52;29:53;"- They say that in Canada a lot."
29:53;29:54;"- Well, you have to understand,"
29:54;29:56;"my dad also drank freeze-dried coffee,"
29:56;29:59;"so his bar was very low."
29:59;30:00;"- It was a step up."
30:00;30:03;"- I can't even imagine the average coffee drinker,"
30:03;30:07;"circa 1975, what they were drinking."
30:07;30:08;"- Oh, it was terrible."
30:08;30:10;"Commodity-based coffee beans."
30:10;30:11;"- Inedible."
30:11;30:11;"- Over-roasted."
30:11;30:14;"You know, I started drinking coffee in the '80s,"
30:14;30:19;"so I was a child of the terrible bean era."
30:19;30:23;"Starbucks maybe had started on the West Coast,"
30:23;30:27;"but certainly had made it to the Midwest where I grew up."
30:27;30:27;"- Where'd you grow up?"
30:27;30:29;"- I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska."
30:29;30:32;"- So have you ever been in Omaha now as an adult,"
30:32;30:34;"and you're like in some cool,"
30:34;30:37;"kind of like, hipster-fied neighborhood"
30:37;30:39;"that has like New York-style lofts,"
30:39;30:39;"and there's a coffee shop,"
30:39;30:41;"and you go in and check it out"
30:41;30:44;"and like drink a Nitro cold brew or something?"
30:44;30:47;"That's exactly the type of coffee that wasn't available"
30:47;30:49;"in the '80s in a place like Omaha."
30:49;30:51;"Are you like, I'm really glad that the kids of today"
30:51;30:54;"in Omaha can drink the exact same stuff"
30:54;30:56;"that people in New York or LA are drinking,"
30:56;30:58;"or is it bittersweet?"
30:58;31:01;"Do we lose something when things like Nitro cold brew"
31:01;31:03;"are in every city in America?"
31:03;31:06;"- (laughs) No, I have no nostalgia"
31:06;31:09;"for the old ways of coffee making,"
31:09;31:10;"and the way it was sold."
31:10;31:13;"It just wasn't good coffee."
31:13;31:16;"I think we still battle that perception"
31:16;31:20;"of third-wave coffee being sort of snobbish."
31:20;31:21;"- Right."
31:21;31:23;"- But I look at it a different way."
31:23;31:25;"I like to look at it a different way."
31:25;31:29;"It's like, people used to think that Miller High Life"
31:29;31:33;"or Bud Light was good beer,"
31:33;31:35;"and then the craft beer movement came along,"
31:35;31:39;"and you realized there was this whole broad spectrum"
31:39;31:43;"of beers available, really delicious beers,"
31:43;31:45;"many different flavors, different styles,"
31:45;31:48;"different bodies, different hop counts,"
31:48;31:50;"and coffee is much the same way."
31:50;31:52;"Now, whether or not everyone can afford it,"
31:52;31:53;"that's another thing."
31:53;31:55;"I mean, that's a whole other issue about,"
31:55;31:58;"can people really afford a good cup of coffee,"
31:58;31:59;"and should you be a snob about people"
31:59;32:02;"that still drink Folger as well?"
32:02;32:05;"No, everyone to each their own."
32:05;32:08;"- But for you personally, you're never on a road trip,"
32:08;32:09;"and you pull into a little diner,"
32:09;32:11;"like a Twin Peaks-style diner,"
32:11;32:14;"you get a slice of pie and just a cup of black coffee,"
32:14;32:16;"whatever garbage they're making back there,"
32:16;32:17;"and you sip, and you're like,"
32:17;32:20;"you know what, there's something nice about this too."
32:20;32:22;"- You know, I will sometimes do that,"
32:22;32:24;"but it's mostly just out of desperation,"
32:24;32:26;"'cause I want something hot and caffeinated,"
32:26;32:30;"and I can't find something better that's closer."
32:30;32:33;"'Cause I really, like I was in San Francisco"
32:33;32:35;"and Los Angeles last week,"
32:35;32:37;"and I stayed at a hotel"
32:37;32:40;"that had one of those little brewers in there,"
32:40;32:43;"and it's truly, I mean, it's a terrible cup of coffee,"
32:43;32:47;"but I was tired, I had to get up early for interviews,"
32:47;32:50;"and I needed some caffeine, so I did it,"
32:50;32:53;"but it was like a drug."
32:53;32:56;"It makes you realize that it's partly"
32:56;32:58;"after year after the high."
32:58;32:58;"- That's how I feel."
32:58;33:01;"- I wanna have one of those little brewers in my bedroom,"
33:01;33:03;"'cause when I'm at a hotel, I like that."
33:03;33:05;"I like that I can have a little,"
33:05;33:06;"Jake's shaking his head no,"
33:06;33:09;"but I like that I can have a little (beep)"
33:09;33:12;"pod coffee, it's like the primer,"
33:12;33:13;"then I jump in the shower,"
33:13;33:16;"then 20 to 30 minutes later, maybe I hit the street,"
33:16;33:18;"and I get something more artisanal."
33:18;33:20;"But I like to have that base high."
33:20;33:22;"- Sure, yeah, no, I completely get it."
33:22;33:25;"- But so, okay, so all things considered,"
33:25;33:27;"you think that the rise and spread of cold brew"
33:27;33:31;"is a good thing, more options, different kinds of flavors,"
33:31;33:34;"you're happy that you see it popping up everywhere now?"
33:34;33:35;"- Well, not just cold brew,"
33:35;33:38;"I mean, I know you're sort of focused on cold brew,"
33:38;33:41;"and I'm glad that cold brew's there,"
33:41;33:43;"'cause I do think that people,"
33:43;33:45;"I think it's like a gateway into the third wave."
33:45;33:49;"I think one of the secrets of third wave coffee shops"
33:49;33:52;"is many of them serve cold brew,"
33:52;33:54;"but not many of them really like it,"
33:54;33:56;"'cause it doesn't give you the full range of flavors,"
33:56;33:58;"but I think that gets you into that shop,"
33:58;34:03;"and introduces you to different coffee beans, perhaps,"
34:03;34:06;"depending on what the coffee shop is using for its cold brew,"
34:06;34:10;"and then maybe, you know, if you're open to suggestion"
34:10;34:12;"from the barista, you'll move into something"
34:12;34:14;"that's even more interesting and more complex."
34:14;34:17;"So I think it's good, I'm all for it."
34:17;34:19;"- Okay, well, thanks a lot, Tim, great talking to you."
34:19;34:21;"Appreciate it. - Yeah, it was fun, thanks, guys."
34:21;34:22;"- All right, have a good one, man."

35:42;35:44;"- Jake, do you drink cold brew? - Yeah."
35:44;35:47;"- You'll go into a place and you'll specifically ask for a cold brew."
35:47;35:50;"You drink a black cold brew? - I ask for iced coffee,"
35:50;35:53;"but I go to fancy places. - You ask for an iced coffee"
35:53;35:56;"and they give you a cold brew? - Yeah, that's standard."
35:56;35:59;"If you're going to a bougie coffee place in LA"
35:59;36:02;"and you ask for iced coffee, that's what it's gonna be."
36:02;36:05;"- See, would you rather have an artisanal coffee cold brew"
36:05;36:08;"than just a tall boy iced coffee from a dunk of donuts?"
36:08;36:10;"- Yeah, I'm not gonna drink that."
36:10;36:13;"I'll make iced coffee at home 'cause I'll make a strong pot"
36:13;36:15;"to begin with. - Yeah."
36:15;36:18;"- I'll let it cool to room temp, and then I'll add 4 or 5 ice cubes"
36:18;36:21;"into the mug. - Does that home iced coffee taste better than the cold brew?"
36:21;36:23;"- No, it actually doesn't."
36:23;36:26;"And actually, this came across my desk yesterday"
36:26;36:29;"'cause I was at home working and I had"
36:29;36:32;"the home-brewed mug of coffee that had cooled down"
36:32;36:35;"and I added ice coffee-- or ice cubes, and I was just gonna sip on that."
36:35;36:39;"Then Hannah came home with a half-drunk cold brew."
36:39;36:42;"- So you had an accidental taste test. - And the cold brew was so much richer."
36:42;36:45;"- Richer. - So much better."
36:45;36:48;"I just dumped the homemade mug down the drain immediately."
36:48;36:50;"- Maybe I just got trash taste at the end of the day."
36:50;36:53;"What do you drink, Seinfeld? - I drink everything,"
36:53;36:56;"but I was thinking about-- actually, I was in Whole Foods"
36:56;36:59;"and I saw a can of cold brew. - Really? You go to Whole Foods?"
36:59;37:02;"- Yeah, there's one near my home base. - Oh, I didn't know."
37:02;37:05;"- And I came across this can, and it was Ethiopian"
37:05;37:08;"single estate cold brew,"
37:08;37:11;"really nicely designed can, and I thought, ""This is gonna be a treat"
37:11;37:14;"for tomorrow morning."" - Yeah. - And I cracked it open"
37:14;37:17;"at 7.45, whatever, and it was the most"
37:17;37:20;"disgusting thing I have ever drank in my life."
37:20;37:23;"- 'Cause it was that Sour Diesel cold brew. - It was--"
37:23;37:26;"- Hold on. - Sour Diesel is a very accurate way to describe it."
37:26;37:29;"- Now, were you drinking it out of the can? - Straight out the can."
37:29;37:32;"- Why didn't you pour that over some ice into a pint glass?"
37:32;37:35;"- 'Cause it was cold. I had it in the fridge. It was already cold."
37:35;37:38;"- Here's the thing. I think cold brew is sort of like-- it's like whiskey."
37:38;37:41;"You have to pour it over ice, let it sit for a minute or two."
37:41;37:44;"It needs to be a little bit diluted. I would never want"
37:44;37:47;"to just drink cold brew with no ice."
37:47;37:50;"- But it's already cold. - Yeah, but you need the ice."
37:50;37:53;"- You need that ice. - It dilutes it. It's a texture thing."
37:53;37:56;"- Yeah, I'm talking about that. - Also, coffee out of a can seems like a weird sensory--"
37:56;37:59;"- It did have the aluminum kind of-- - Yeah, that's not a-- - --tangent of, like, yeah."
37:59;38:02;"- You gotta get it out of the can, man. Also, first cup of the day,"
38:02;38:05;"gotta be hot. - Good call. - Wait, actually, this reminds me"
38:05;38:08;"before we get to talk to some more cold brew experts."
38:08;38:11;"Remember a few episodes ago we talked about Canadians double-dipping"
38:11;38:14;"at Tim Hortons and Starbucks? - Yep. - We were like, ""Is it cool"
38:14;38:17;"to roll into Tim Hortons with a Starbucks coffee and be like,"
38:17;38:20;"'Let me get a maple-glazed donut?'"" We actually got some good emails about it."
38:20;38:23;"- A lot of response to that, yeah. - We did get a lot. Here's a good one from"
38:23;38:26;"Heather MacDonald. ""Hey, Crisis Crew. Big fan of the show."
38:26;38:29;"Emailing in from Toronto. I'm currently listening to episode 72,"
38:29;38:32;"'Late I Know.' Well, time crisis is just nothing."""
38:32;38:35;"- It's evergreen. - ""If not timely."
38:35;38:38;"I needed to speak up about the concept of Canadians double-dipping"
38:38;38:42;"in Starbucks and Tim Hortons, and I will say this is 100% a real thing."
38:42;38:45;"When I was in high school, the local Tim Hortons was directly behind a Starbucks,"
38:45;38:51;"and we'd often send someone into Tim's for a good muffin/sandwich/donut"
38:51;38:55;"and someone else into Starbucks to get our coffee to avoid being exposed."
38:55;38:58;"Being alone was a nightmare, as the employees would always try to make"
38:58;39:01;"an awkward joke about buying from both establishments."
39:01;39:05;"Was it uncomfortable? Yes. Was it necessary? Also yes."
39:05;39:08;"Anyways, love your work out there and just thought I'd give my two cents on the subject."
39:08;39:11;"All the best, Heather."" - Starbucks has muffins too."
39:11;39:14;"- But I guess they're not as good. Well, you're actually Canadian, Seinfeld."
39:14;39:19;"What do you think-- she's describing being alone, and you roll in with your Frappuccino"
39:19;39:23;"from Starbucks, and then you go to the Tim Hortons employee, and then she said"
39:23;39:26;"they would make an awkward joke. What would that joke be?"
39:26;39:31;"- Oh, hmm. They'd say, ""Oh, you're a traitor. Oh, I see."" Something like that."
39:31;39:34;"""Oh, you're betraying us."" Something like that, maybe?"
39:34;39:37;"- And us is Tim Hortons, or is it Canada?"
39:37;39:40;"[laughter]"
39:40;39:43;"- I think in that case it would be Tim Hortons, but it's very poetic."
39:43;39:47;"- You know how in some countries where people are very polite, the joke is that"
39:47;39:51;"there's simmering rage beneath the surface? Is that true of Canada?"
39:51;39:54;"Canada always joked me as legitimately nicer."
39:54;39:59;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't want to generalize, but I think you would find some of that for sure."
39:59;40:01;"- Oh, looks like we got a traitor here. Ha ha."
40:01;40:02;"- That-- yeah, exactly."
40:02;40:05;"- We ought to take you around the back and execute you."
40:05;40:08;"- The first-- - Sorry, I'm doing it like Minnesota."
40:08;40:11;"- Whoa, we're going to take you-- no, I can't. I don't know."
40:11;40:13;"- Oh, looks like we got a traitor here. Ha ha."
40:13;40:18;"I ought to take you in the back, blindfold you, shoot you in the back of the head."
40:18;40:21;"That's not very Canadian. A Canadian would never say that."
40:21;40:23;"- The detail is kind of making it a little dark."
40:23;40:26;"- And then here's another one from Darcy Belmore."
40:26;40:29;"""Hey, Crisis Crew, just finished listening to this week's episode."
40:29;40:32;"As a Canadian, I definitely get food at Tim Hortons and coffee at Starbucks,"
40:32;40:36;"at least while on campus. I go to Tim's first, grab an egg, B-E-L-T."""
40:36;40:39;"Oh, because of the egg. It's like ATM machine."
40:39;40:40;"- Belt? That sounds good."
40:40;40:42;"- I go to Tim's first, she's-- grab a belt."
40:42;40:45;"- Get that belt. - A belt. Is that not well known in Canada?"
40:45;40:47;"- This is the first time I've heard of a belt."
40:47;40:50;"- You've never had a belt? I'm guessing it's a bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato."
40:50;40:55;"- I go get a belt on a 12-grain bagel and then walk across campus to Starbucks."
40:55;40:57;"- Damn, that's a hell of a breakfast."
40:57;41:02;"- Tim's coffee is the pits. Darcy, wait, is that a thing? Is Tim's coffee bad?"
41:02;41:07;"- Tim's coffee falls into the same description of like, oh, the real coffee's at Dunkin',"
41:07;41:11;"oh, the good coffee's at McDonald's. Like, it's one of those."
41:11;41:15;"- We got one more email from a dude. I won't read the whole thing, but he's from Buffalo,"
41:15;41:18;"which for those unfamiliar with the city, it lays on the U.S.-Canada border"
41:18;41:22;"and has quite a Canadian feel to it. The winters are long, the people are friendly,"
41:22;41:26;"and ponds are filled with children playing hockey in the chillier months of the year."
41:26;41:29;"But most important of all, it is the rare American exception,"
41:29;41:31;"where most individuals prefer Tim Hortons to Starbucks."
41:31;41:36;"Now that's interesting. Just this past week, I relocated to the Charleston, South Carolina area."
41:36;41:39;"Buffalo to Charleston. - That's a hell of a move."
41:39;41:41;"- That's a hell of a move. There's gonna be some culture shock."
41:41;41:44;"And I'm finding it difficult to part ways with my former morning routine"
41:44;41:49;"of grabbing a coffee from Tim Hortons and the occasional breakfast sandwich from Starbucks."
41:49;41:53;"- Well, reverse. - Yeah. Personally, I find Starbucks to have a delicious array of breakfast sandwiches."
41:53;41:55;"- He's not wrong there. - They're pretty good."
41:55;41:59;"The interesting part of the story is that back home, I often felt embarrassed or ashamed"
41:59;42:04;"to bring my Starbucks wrappers and bags into work or to a friend's house. Wow."
42:04;42:08;"- Shame. - Buffalo, I guess, really is part of Canada."
42:08;42:11;"- I was gonna say, with all due respect, like, this guy's disqualified."
42:11;42:14;"I mean, it's not--technically, it's not, so."
42:14;42:18;"- So he felt ashamed bringing his Starbucks wrappers and bags into work or to a friend's house"
42:18;42:22;"as many in the area felt that Starbucks was a little bougie for their liking."
42:22;42:24;"It might be bougie, but it's American, my friend."
42:24;42:28;"Tim Hortons, you're aiding and abetting."
42:28;42:31;"- It's so, like, ubiquitous, though. I don't know. Wow."
42:31;42:33;"- Anyways, I figured you folks would be interested to know that there are several pockets"
42:33;42:36;"of blue-collar America that are ride or die for Tim Hortons."
42:36;42:38;"I get that, but that's interesting."
42:38;42:42;"- Are people in Buffalo who think Starbucks is bougie, are they hitting, like, the gas station coffee?"
42:42;42:44;"- Oh, I guess--maybe they're hitting Tim Hortons."
42:44;42:49;"- Scooping it out the river. - No, that's a lateral move in terms of, like, class distinctions."
42:49;42:52;"- No, no, no, I think--well, if I'm reading the email correctly--"
42:52;42:54;"- No, it's like a multinational chain."
42:54;43:01;"- No, I'm picturing Dan going into work, holding his, you know, spinach and feta breakfast sandwich"
43:01;43:06;"from Starbucks, and there's just, like, more like a Joe Schmo drinking Tim Hortons coffee."
43:06;43:10;"He's like, ""Oh, welcome to work, your majesty."""
43:10;43:13;"[laughter]"
43:13;43:17;"Let me get a number crunch. How much does just a black coffee cost at Tim Hortons?"
43:17;43:20;"- Well, what size are we talking? - Gotta cross-reference the exchange rate."
43:20;43:27;"- For a tall, it's $160. Grande is $180. And then your venti is $2."
43:27;43:29;"- That's at Tim Hortons. - That's at Tim Hortons."
43:29;43:32;"- Wait, they call venti at Tim Hortons? - Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant Starbucks."
43:32;43:33;"I was converting the names. Okay."
43:33;43:36;"- Oh, so at Starbucks you can get a black coffee for under $2?"
43:36;43:38;"- No way. No, no, no, no, no. I messed up."
43:38;43:43;"- Oh, I bet the small-coffeed Starbucks is $1.85."
43:43;43:46;"- Uh... - This show rules, guys."
43:46;43:48;"[laughter]"
43:48;43:52;"- We really need a video component here to, like, complete that."

48:46;48:48;"- We'll ask him how to pronounce his last name."
48:48;48:51;"But he's the head brewer and guru of cold brew at Stumptown Coffee."
48:51;48:53;"Now, Stumptown, Jake-- - Oh, I'm familiar."
48:53;48:55;"- You're probably familiar. It started in Portland, Oregon."
48:55;48:59;"- I did an exhibition there in 2000, their first store."
48:59;49:01;"- At Stumptown? - Yeah."
49:01;49:03;"It was their only location. - And they offered to pay you"
49:03;49:07;"in stock options or free beans."
49:07;49:11;"- I got the opportunity to hang my art in their coffee shop."
49:11;49:13;"- And sell it. - Oh, yeah."
49:13;49:15;"- Was this guy-- - It's like I sold a few pieces."
49:15;49:17;"- Was Brent, like, part of this? - No, I have no idea."
49:17;49:19;"- Well, he's the head brewer. He wasn't one of the--"
49:19;49:21;"the founders are Dwayne Sorenson."
49:21;49:23;"- I have no idea if Brent was in the mix back in 2000."
49:23;49:25;"I think this was 2000 I did this."
49:25;49:28;"- But Stumptown Coffee was sold to Pete's Coffee in 2015"
49:28;49:31;"for an undisclosed amount. And also, here's something interesting."
49:31;49:34;"Stumptown has the rights to coldbrew.com."
49:34;49:36;"Okay, so we're talking to the right person."
49:36;49:39;"- That's hot real estate. - Let's get Brent on the phone."
49:39;49:42;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
49:42;49:44;"[phone ringing]"
49:45;49:47;"- Hello? - Hey, Brent?"
49:47;49:49;"- Hey, yeah, this is Brent. - Hey, how you doing?"
49:49;49:51;"This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
49:51;49:53;"- Hey, Brent. - Hey, guys, how's it going?"
49:53;49:55;"- Not bad. We may have butchered your last name."
49:55;49:57;"Do you want to tell us how to pronounce it correctly?"
49:57;50:00;"- Yeah, totally. It's Walshinsky."
50:00;50:02;"- Oh, we were close. - A tough one."
50:02;50:04;"A lot of consonants in there."
50:04;50:07;"- So, Brent, you're the head brewer at Stumptown."
50:07;50:09;"How long have you been in the mix over at Stumptown?"
50:09;50:11;"- A little over seven years now."
50:11;50:13;"- So I'm very interested in this because part of the reason"
50:13;50:16;"I'm talking about cold brew is, you know, full disclosure,"
50:16;50:19;"I have a negative view of it. - Oh."
50:19;50:21;"- This has got you journalism. - Yeah."
50:21;50:23;"[laughter]"
50:23;50:27;"- No, I might be--first of all, the more we talk--"
50:27;50:29;"- You're a skeptic. - The more we talk about it,"
50:29;50:31;"I start to question if I know what I'm talking about"
50:31;50:35;"about anything, but the first question that I've had is--"
50:35;50:38;"and I was talking with Jake-- just having this feeling lately"
50:38;50:40;"that it's just everywhere."
50:40;50:44;"Starbucks has it, 7-Eleven has it, gas stations have it,"
50:44;50:47;"and in fact, cold brew has started to become synonymous"
50:47;50:50;"with iced coffee to the point that you see these kind of"
50:50;50:53;"hilarious things where people are like, ""I want a cold brew."""
50:53;50:56;"""Do you mean an iced coffee?"" You know, like, it's all confused."
50:56;50:59;"So it's always interesting to see how something just suddenly,"
50:59;51:02;"seemingly suddenly, just takes over the world."
51:02;51:05;"So Stumptown was something of a pioneer?"
51:05;51:09;"- I think so. I mean, cold brew, like,"
51:09;51:12;"as an extraction process, was definitely around before"
51:12;51:15;"Stumptown was around, right? Like, extracting something"
51:15;51:18;"with cold water over a long period of time, like sun tea, right?"
51:18;51:21;"Like, that's kind of a similar idea where you're letting tea"
51:21;51:24;"sit in water at a cooler temperature."
51:24;51:27;"- So there's a long history, but this modern cold brew--"
51:27;51:29;"so just paint a picture for me. What year was this"
51:29;51:31;"when you started at Stumptown?"
51:31;51:35;"- 2011. At that time, cold brew was, I think,"
51:35;51:37;"maybe a little popular in cafes, but not that big of a deal"
51:37;51:40;"and kind of unknown. You know, we weren't pioneers"
51:40;51:43;"in the cold brew process, but we were pioneers in the idea"
51:43;51:46;"of, like, bottling it and turning it into, like,"
51:46;51:49;"this big, like, quick, easy thing."
51:49;51:51;"- Right, those little Stumptown bottles."
51:51;51:53;"That was, like-- - Yeah, those stubbies."
51:53;51:56;"- But so, hold on a sec. If I walked into a Stumptown"
51:56;52:01;"in 2010, 2009, and asked for an iced coffee,"
52:01;52:03;"would I be getting a different product today"
52:03;52:06;"as opposed to 10 years ago, 8 years ago?"
52:06;52:09;"- That's a good question. Just because I started at 2011."
52:09;52:11;"But no, I think there probably was a time"
52:11;52:15;"where we were doing iced coffee in that we were brewing hot"
52:15;52:18;"at double the strength and then pouring over ice"
52:18;52:21;"and then the ice dilutes into the solution,"
52:21;52:23;"and now you have, like, somewhere in the realm"
52:23;52:25;"of, like, the dissolved solids in that beverage"
52:25;52:27;"are, like, close to, like, what you would get"
52:27;52:31;"at an RTD coffee. I don't know when we started doing,"
52:31;52:33;"like, the cold brew process. I know it was definitely"
52:33;52:36;"before the stubbies came out. But so if you were"
52:36;52:39;"to order a cold brew, you would be getting"
52:39;52:42;"something that was extracted in cold water"
52:42;52:44;"and diluted and served."
52:44;52:46;"- But that's, like, the standardized understanding"
52:46;52:50;"of iced coffee at Stumptown today."
52:50;52:52;"If you walk into a-- - Well, at Stumptown today,"
52:52;52:54;"we don't serve iced coffee. - Copy that."
52:54;52:56;"- Right, so, like, the only cold coffee--"
52:56;52:57;"- So you guys murdered iced coffee."
52:57;52:59;"- Well, actually, I guess we have iced Americanos,"
52:59;53:01;"you know, that would qualify as iced coffee for sure."
53:01;53:03;"But in terms of, like, a--"
53:03;53:04;"like, what a lot of people do, right,"
53:04;53:07;"is, like, they brew a pour-over, right,"
53:07;53:10;"or a Fetco or whatever batch brew method"
53:10;53:13;"at twice the strength and then pour it over ice,"
53:13;53:14;"knowing that that ice is going to dilute."
53:14;53:16;"That's why they brew it at double the strength"
53:16;53:19;"and then serve that as iced coffee."

53:47;53:49;"Am I insane? I have this feeling"
53:49;53:52;"that I like iced Americanos and I like iced coffee."
53:52;53:54;"My impression of cold brew is that it's sour."
53:54;53:56;"- Interesting. - Am I just crazy?"
53:56;53:57;"- No, I don't think you're crazy."
53:57;53:59;"I think--like, so here's the thing."
53:59;54:03;"I think right now, like, cold brew is such a new thing."
54:03;54:05;"I think the craft beer industry went through this too,"
54:05;54:07;"where, like, craft beer started."
54:07;54:10;"There were a few, like, really, really good beers out there,"
54:10;54:13;"but then, like, a ton of other people flooded the market"
54:13;54:15;"and were like, ""We can do this too,"""
54:15;54:19;"and made, like, a lot of really bad beer as well, right?"
54:19;54:20;"And I think, like, right now,"
54:20;54:24;"we're sort of in that time where there are some companies"
54:24;54:27;"that are like, ""Oh, coffee and water, I got it."
54:27;54:29;"Like, we can totally do this,"""
54:29;54:32;"and, like, they may not be interested"
54:32;54:33;"in buying high-quality coffee,"
54:33;54:36;"but they are interested in, like, the whole cold brew--"
54:36;54:38;"the excitement around cold brew--"
54:38;54:41;"and are using some form of the cold brew method,"
54:41;54:43;"but with, like, really low-quality coffee."
54:43;54:47;"- Does cold brew, do you think, to the consumers,"
54:47;54:48;"read as fancier?"
54:48;54:53;"- I don't think, like, that's something we're trying to portray"
54:53;54:55;"It is typically more expensive,"
54:55;54:58;"but that's because it takes a lot more coffee"
54:58;54:59;"to make cold brew."
54:59;55:02;"And that's why, typically, you know, a lot of people say,"
55:02;55:04;"like, cold brew also makes them, like,"
55:04;55:05;"get really high on caffeine."
55:05;55:08;"Like, it really is, like, by volume,"
55:08;55:10;"more coffee dissolved into it."
55:10;55:11;"- That's not just a myth."
55:11;55:14;"You really could get more twisted off cold brew."
55:14;55:15;"- Totally. Yeah, yeah."
55:15;55:18;"Like, I think we've run some caffeine analysis on ours,"
55:18;55:21;"and, like, I think our stubby has something like"
55:21;55:24;"200, 250 milligrams of caffeine."
55:24;55:26;"Whereas, like, a typical 10-ounce, you know,"
55:26;55:29;"cup of coffee would probably be, like,"
55:29;55:30;"100 or 130 milligrams."
55:30;55:34;"- So it could almost be double just like a plain cup of coffee."
55:34;55:35;"- Yeah, and, like, a lot of our offerings"
55:35;55:38;"are, like, different TBSs, like, total dissolved solids."
55:38;55:42;"So, like, our original cold brew is kind of, like,"
55:42;55:43;"the most, like, refreshing"
55:43;55:46;"and has the most water versus coffee."
55:46;55:49;"But something like our Nitro hairbenders, like,"
55:49;55:51;"a really, really high amount of coffee."
55:51;55:53;"And that's somewhere in the realm of, like,"
55:53;55:55;"400 milligrams of caffeine or so."
55:55;55:57;"But I guess to get back to your question about"
55:57;55:58;"whether or not it's fancy, like,"
55:58;56:01;"I think maybe some people do because it's typically"
56:01;56:03;"in the $4 or $5 range."
56:03;56:06;"But I don't want to be this person who's saying, like,"
56:06;56:09;"this brew method is, like, 100% better."
56:09;56:12;"I think all brew methods are just different and,"
56:12;56:14;"you know, highlight different things"
56:14;56:15;"and are for different people."
56:15;56:17;"So that when someone's like, ""Oh, I don't like cold brew,"""
56:17;56:18;"I'm like, ""That's totally cool."""
56:18;56:20;"You know, like, ""I don't like mocha pot."""
56:20;56:21;"Right, just a matter of taste."
56:21;56:23;"Yeah, it's a different method."
56:23;56:25;"Brent, when's the last time you had just, like,"
56:25;56:27;"a Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee?"
56:27;56:30;"That's a good question, too."
56:30;56:31;"I..."
56:31;56:33;"Or coffee bean, just that type of place."
56:33;56:35;"I, like, drink Starbucks, like, semi-frequently."
56:35;56:37;"Like, when I'm out camping or whatever, you know,"
56:37;56:39;"I'm, like, out in the middle of nowhere."
56:39;56:40;"I don't hate it, you know?"
56:40;56:42;"I'm not, like, sometimes I just, like, really need coffee."
56:42;56:45;"Does anybody ever go make a Starbucks run"
56:45;56:47;"just to get out of the office?"
56:47;56:49;"That's a good question."
56:49;56:51;"No, I think I can firmly say, like,"
56:51;56:53;"that definitely does not happen."
56:53;56:55;"I think, like, we're also spoiled with free coffee"
56:55;56:57;"and great coffee."
56:57;56:58;"Right."
56:58;57:00;"Have you tried, like, the Starbucks cold brew?"
57:00;57:01;"Yeah, yeah, totally."
57:01;57:03;"And it's decent?"
57:03;57:06;"Yeah, no, I actually think they're doing a decent job"
57:06;57:10;"in regards to, like, extraction and process."
57:10;57:13;"Like, in that I think a Starbucks cold brew"
57:13;57:15;"tastes like Starbucks coffee."
57:15;57:17;"There's no, like, adulteration or, like,"
57:17;57:20;"it's a clean, like, representation of Starbucks coffee."
57:20;57:22;"Mm, that's interesting."
57:22;57:24;"But I think in that regard, like, I appreciate it"
57:24;57:26;"from, like, the brewing aspect."
57:26;57:28;"Like, I think there are probably some really smart people"
57:28;57:31;"working at Starbucks working on these beverages."
57:31;57:35;"I personally don't like the typical profile of Starbucks."
57:35;57:37;"Like, I'm not craving it, but I don't..."
57:37;57:38;"I feel you on that."
57:38;57:40;"But at least it tracks from beverage to beverage?"
57:40;57:41;"Yeah, yeah."
57:41;57:43;"It's kind of like if you don't, like,"
57:43;57:46;"the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but you still admire"
57:46;57:49;"Avengers Infinity War as an ambitious crossover event."
57:49;57:50;"[laughs]"
57:50;57:52;"I guess that's true, yeah."
57:52;57:54;"Or, like, Budweiser, right?"
57:54;57:56;"Like, I love a Budweiser sometimes,"
57:56;57:58;"but, like, what I mostly appreciate"
57:58;58:01;"and, like, find so incredible about them is, like,"
58:01;58:03;"you know, it's brewed all over the country,"
58:03;58:05;"and, like, no matter where you buy it,"
58:05;58:06;"it tastes exactly the same."
58:06;58:08;"Like, that's a pretty impressive feat."
58:08;58:09;"No, you're right."
58:09;58:10;"There's definitely something to be said for that."
58:10;58:12;"Well, thanks so much, Brent, for filling us in."
58:12;58:13;"Yeah, totally."
58:13;58:15;"I'm definitely gonna roll down to a Stumptown soon."
58:15;58:16;"There's not one in my immediate neighborhood,"
58:16;58:18;"but this really makes me want to go explore"
58:18;58:19;"the Stumptown menu a bit more."
58:19;58:21;"Yeah, if you're ever in Portland,"
58:21;58:23;"I'd love to give you a tour of the facility."
58:23;58:24;"Oh, that'd be sick."
58:24;58:26;"I'm sure we'll be up in Portland sometime in the next year."
58:26;58:28;"All right, thanks so much, man. Have a good one."

01:00:34;01:00:37;"about something that's very time crisis-y."
01:00:37;01:00:41;"And that is Jason Alexander, a.k.a. George Costanza,"
01:00:41;01:00:45;"is appearing in a new KFC ad where he plays the Colonel."
01:00:45;01:00:49;"This is the official KFC press release on the KFC website."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"Kentucky Fried Chicken announced today that it has selected"
01:00:52;01:00:55;"actor, comedian, and director Jason Alexander as the latest celebrity"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"to play the role of the brand's iconic founder, Colonel Harland Sanders."
01:00:59;01:01:03;"Did you know the Colonel's first name? Jake, you did?"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Harland Sanders."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Beginning August 6, ads featuring the sitcom veteran as the Colonel"
01:01:09;01:01:15;"and dinner time hero will air on television and computer screens nationwide"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"to promote KFC's $20 Philips trademark,"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"which for the first time are available in four different varieties."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"We could literally just talk about the press release."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"It's like then they shift."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"Modern families want and need mealtime to be simple and stress-free."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"KFC knows this can be a feat when the clock strikes 5 p.m."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"and wants to help families solve the dinner time challenge"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"without sacrificing taste."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"It's true."
01:01:38;01:01:42;"A working family being able to go feed everybody for a low price at KFC"
01:01:42;01:01:46;"is helpful, but like KFC just wants to help."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"Language is like chill."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"To do just that, KFC has enlisted sitcom king Alexander"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"to offer its $20 Philips four different ways,"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"including a new boneless filet $20 Philip."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"And then there's a quote from the CMO,"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"Andrea Zahiminski."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"""I am all too familiar with the challenge of family dinner."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"With four chicken meals to choose from and each at only $20,"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"we're continuing KFC's tradition of providing an easy dinner time solution"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"for families at great value."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And there's no better person to spread the word about our new family of four"
01:02:13;01:02:17;"in a sitcom setting than comedy extraordinaire Jason Alexander."""
01:02:17;01:02:20;"Alexander's background as the star of one of the greatest sitcoms of all time"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"makes him the perfect choice."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Then they have a quote from Jason."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"""As the son of two working parents, there were plenty of dinner times"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"when a bucket of chicken and all the fixins saved the day."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"It's been fun to combine my personal love for KFC"
01:02:34;01:02:39;"with my sitcom experience into a new take on the role of Colonel Sanders."""
01:02:39;01:02:42;"I feel like one time we were talking about this after a time crisis"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"is sometimes when people--"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"I mean, I think these days people don't get particularly annoyed"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"for somebody doing an ad."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"I mean, at the end of the day, it's like, yeah, we all eat KFC from time to time."
01:02:53;01:02:57;"Why get angry at an actor or musician?"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"It's fine."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"It's just interesting that very few people ever say--"
01:03:01;01:03:05;"when asked about, like, why did you let your song be in this commercial,"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"why did you participate in that, just be like,"
01:03:07;01:03:11;"""You know, because I got no problem with it, and whatever, they paid for it."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Who cares?"""
01:03:13;01:03:17;"A lot of times people get a little defensive and say, ""Well, I actually eat KFC."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"It's not like I did this Boston market."""
01:03:19;01:03:22;"There's some part of me that's always been like, ""Who cares?"""
01:03:22;01:03:25;"I actually drink Pepsi, okay?"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"It actually made me feel good."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"I used to drink Pepsi with my grandpa, so, you know, f---ing leave me alone."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"I don't know if that's what's happening with Jason Alexander."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"I actually imagine that--"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"I did this for free."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah, see, that's also funny too."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"It makes a lot more sense to me to be like--"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"somebody asked me, ""Why did you have a Van Perrogen song in a Honda ad?"""
01:03:40;01:03:42;"I'd be like, ""Who f---ing cares?"""
01:03:42;01:03:44;"We said no to corporations we thought were horrible."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Honda seemed fine. They paid for it."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"More people heard the song. That's why we did it"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"versus like, ""I've actually driven in Hondas."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"I got high for the first time in a Honda."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"It's part of my heritage."""
01:03:55;01:03:56;"Yeah, because there's also something funny."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"If you like it so much, why charge?"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"It actually makes more sense."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"Why did you let them use your song?"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"Because I wanted Honda to pay versus like--"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"Yeah, I wanted to gouge those MFers."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"And sometimes it feels that way."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Nothing wrong with Honda."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"Please forgive me, Honda."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"Listen, we had to do a retrofit on the foundation of the house, okay?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"The earthquake insurance was through the roof."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Or just say because--"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"Needed the check."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Because being an actor, being a musician,"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"it's inherently stressful and you take money where you can get it sometimes."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"Actually, here's something I've been thinking about"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"because I've been watching so much Seinfeld lately"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"since we started doing Seinfeld Sundays."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Chronological order or just randos?"
01:04:32;01:04:36;"No, I tend to watch a season in order, but I bounce around."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"I've always found the last couple seasons very interesting."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"When Larry David left, the music gets way hardcore."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"It starts to go, ""Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."""
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Really?"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"The music gets really crazy and the cuts got way faster."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"I have to check that out."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Watch season 7 or season 8."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"It's kind of like Jerry just started doing his thing."
01:04:52;01:04:57;"To his credit, season 7 and 8 have so many classic episodes"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"and even conceptually."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"You mean 8 and 9?"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"Oh, 8 and 9. Is that what I mean?"
01:05:01;01:05:02;"Yeah."
01:05:02;01:05:05;"8 and 9 has the yada yada episode."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"There's just so many classics."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"But the cuts get way faster."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"There starts to be these 12-second scenes"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"where Jerry's like, ""Kramer, what are you doing?"""
01:05:13;01:05:15;"[imitates gunfire]"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"It just starts to move really quick."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Also, they're outdoors a lot more."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"They're on this fake New York street quite a bit."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"Oh, I remember that."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"The Warner soundstage."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"It's like the world opened up a bit."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"I would say the humor didn't change at all,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"but the pacing and the [imitates gunfire]"
01:05:31;01:05:34;"The Bizarro Jerry is also in those seasons."
01:05:34;01:05:38;"This is also post the accidental death of Susan."
01:05:38;01:05:42;"So George's character now sort of has this dark cloud over him"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"for the remainder of the show."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"Really? He carried that?"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"They reference it often."
01:05:47;01:05:50;"He works for this foundation that's been set up to--"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"There's even an episode where he goes back to the store"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"where he bought the envelopes."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Yes."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"But anyway, so I've been watching so much Seinfeld,"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"and then it's actually been a problem"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"because it's all I want to watch."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"And then I want to watch secondary stuff,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"so I've been watching all the DVD extras"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"that people have ripped and put on YouTube."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"And one thing I've been thinking about,"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"obviously he was so typecast as George,"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"but Jason Alexander in the interviews,"
01:06:12;01:06:15;"he actually seems like he's so warm,"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"even though he's an incredibly talented actor,"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"he's so deferential towards Larry and Jerry."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"He weirdly seems like he doesn't have a--"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"well, maybe not weirdly,"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"but he just seems like for a famous dude,"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"he just doesn't have a lot of ego about it."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"He truly loved the show."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"He admired the writers, and he did his thing."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"And he kind of comes from a classically trained"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"acting background, maybe the only one of the four."
01:06:36;01:06:39;"So as I'm watching it, I was just kind of like,"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"""Jason Alexander should be in more stuff."""
01:06:41;01:06:43;"So I literally, before this came out,"
01:06:43;01:06:47;"I was thinking, ""How come he hasn't had some breakout dark role?"""
01:06:47;01:06:50;"Or, ""How come Jason Alexander wasn't on Breaking Bad or something?"""
01:06:50;01:06:52;"Yeah, playing someone's weird dad or something"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"in some dark indie movie."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Yeah, he should be on an HBO show or an indie movie."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"Yeah, like a weird Todd Sollins movie or something."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Yeah, exactly."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"I was just thinking, he's such a great actor,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"and he just even seems to have a great attitude"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"about the fact that he was a part of this,"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"and he just seems very thankful."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"So anyway, I want to see Jason Alexander get that money."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"I mean, I'm sure he's fine from Seinfeld,"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"but it's like I'm not mad at it at all."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"So I just kind of wondered if they'd offer him this."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"And he's like, ""Sure, I'll do it. That'll be fun."""

01:08:57;01:08:59;"That's a good idea, dude."

01:10:13;01:10:15;"Comedy or drama?"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"Maybe because people in the online Seinfeld fan community"

01:10:34;01:10:35;"Yeah, same."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"I think that's why I couldn't watch it."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"What's the Audien-- that's, like, a cable channel?"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"It's a channel owned by AT&T."
01:10:41;01:10:45;"And I think it's-- you can only see it through direct TV."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"I feel like there was some onion or something to add"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"that was, like, a joke about, like, a new platform"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"that you could only view on the ordering screens at McDonald's."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"What was the joke?"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"I think that's what it was, yeah."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"It's a platform owned by KFC."
01:10:57;01:11:00;"I have also lately been feeling like"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"there's just too much content, you know?"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"It's been hard for me to want to start a new show"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"or even a movie because--"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"and maybe it's similar to turning my back on cold brew"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"and just wanting to drink Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Dude, you're just going old man here."

01:11:33;01:11:35;"Do you notice that?"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"There was no hype?"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"It was on Wednesday."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"You guys are speaking Russian."

01:11:50;01:11:52;"Jake's posted up at Civilian Coffee"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"with an $8 cold brew,"

01:12:11;01:12:15;"I'm at Dunkin' Donuts watching Seinfeld on my tablet."
01:12:15;01:12:16;"Oh, man."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"I think also, you know,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"maybe it's from working on the album so long"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"and, like, having to play shows and just so much on my mind."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"It's kind of like when we worked on Contra,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"I could only watch The Office."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Oh, wow. Okay."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"And actually, later I found out that for a lot of people,"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"The Office is like a classic comfort food show."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Just throw that on, yeah."

01:12:39;01:12:41;"I watched from the first season to the last,"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"and it started over again."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"I don't understand that."
01:12:43;01:12:45;"I would never re-watch The Office."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"And people, like, throw on TV in, like, an ambient way."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"It's just on in the back."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"I've never understood that."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Would you re-watch Seinfeld?"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Yeah, not in its entirety, but I would, like,"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"if I was in a specific mood, I'd be like,"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"""Oh, I'll throw Seinfeld on."""
01:12:57;01:12:59;"It's because these sitcoms are more comforting"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"because, you know, I've watched maybe The Sopranos three times,"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"and I kind of want to watch it for a fourth time."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"But it's, like, it's an emotional, dark experience for me."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"I don't re-watch TV. It's so--"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"You never re-watch The Sopranos?"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Mm-mm."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"Well, you know, that's an important cultural artifact"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"for where I'm from."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"No, I know. I could see it."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"For me, if I'm going to watch something,"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"I want it to be, like, new."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"I'm going to really give it my attention."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"I know. It's the exact opposite attitude you have to music."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"It's absolutely true."

01:15:11;01:15:14;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
01:15:14;01:15:18;"I feel like I noticed that you were tweeting with somebody who was like,"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"""I've just been listening to some late TC episodes."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"What are other good ones to listen to?"" or something."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"Yeah."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"And you said you should go back to the start,"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"but then people were commenting on that or replying and saying,"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"""Well, here's different good ones to check out."""
01:15:29;01:15:32;"And I was like, ""We got to put together the greatest hits, TC episode,"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"because for us, it's just such a--"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"Like, we can't remember where the good runs were."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"No."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"We can't remember the good conversations."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"TC heads, no."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"The TC heads, no, but--"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"Grape Ice Cream."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Grape Ice Cream."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"What else?"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"What other stuff do people like?"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"The One Direction on Nantucket movie."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"What was that one about?"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"Yeah, the hardware store."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"The hardware store."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"Oh, that horrid."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Bedsheets, obviously."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"That was like a three-parter."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"We've had--"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"My Ribs."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Oh, yeah, Lonnie's Dad."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"Lonnie's Dad."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"Yeah, that's the two-fridge."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Lonnie's Dad, the two-fridge."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"That's pretty legendary for me."
01:16:10;01:16:14;"Anyway, that's a long-term project, is the Time Crisis Archive project."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"You know what?"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"We got to start making dicks pics of Time Crisis."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"TCDB.com."
01:16:19;01:16:25;"Okay, we're going to start putting out compilations that are the best choice nugs from Time Crisis"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"on very nice limited edition vinyl."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"And it's going to be volume 1 through 10, and we're going to pick the best of the best."
01:16:33;01:16:36;"But we need a name like Dick's Pics."
01:16:36;01:16:40;"I mean, it could be Jake's Takes, but I've always felt like it didn't make quite enough sense."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"No, no, I don't think that's it."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Jake's Rakes?"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"Jake's raked the leaves of Time Crisis and cleaned it up into something?"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"I was pushing it."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Nothing rhymes with Ezra, so that's--"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"Or something to do with the Crisis Crew?"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"True Crew?"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"Let's see what some synonyms for pics are."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"Choice."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"Choice Crew?"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Crisis Choice."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"What rhymes with select?"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Detect?"
01:17:01;01:17:02;"Crew?"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"This is--"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"This is really--"
01:17:04;01:17:09;"This is really scraping the bottom."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"This show rules."
01:17:13;01:17:18;"This is almost like Behind the Seeds."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"We're breaking the fourth wall."
01:17:20;01:17:26;"Okay, EddieTCHeads, if you can come up with a good idea what we can name our numero group"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"of vinyl selections."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Yeah, yeah, hit us up."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"I mean, it could be Seinfeld Selections."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"Seinfeld Selects?"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Better."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"We could make it intentionally awkward."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"Like, Top Choice of Seinfeld."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"A little like a weird translation."
01:17:42;01:17:46;"Or you could just name each album off of one of the tracks."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"Like, the first one could just be called Grape Ice Cream."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Right."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"You know."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Second album's called Lonnie's Dad."
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Yeah, so it could be like Time Crisis Volume 3 Lonnie's Dad."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Okay, but if anybody has a good idea, let us know."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Okay, time for the top five."
01:18:00;01:18:07;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"Okay, so this is going to be a pretty interesting one."
01:18:10;01:18:15;"We're doing the top five songs on iTunes right now versus the Billboard top five of this"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"week in 1999."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"Why '99?"
01:18:18;01:18:23;"That was the year that Stumptown was founded in Portland, Oregon."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"Also the year I graduated college in Portland, Oregon."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Really?"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"Yeah, man."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"Stumptown on Belmont Street."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"That's kind of interesting."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"You graduate college."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"Third wave takes off."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"And third wave takes off."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"So that's a hell of a way to enter the workforce."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"I didn't work there."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"I worked at Papa John's."
01:18:39;01:18:43;"I know, but you probably grabbed a cold brew there or an iced coffee."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"Hot cup."
01:18:44;01:18:48;"You know, that'd be like graduating college in '69 with the moon landing."
01:18:48;01:18:53;"I was going to say when Levi's Strauss is starting in San Francisco."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"You know, the gap."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"You're right."
01:18:55;01:18:59;"Sometimes people graduate college at a time when there's like an oil crisis."
01:18:59;01:19:04;"And sometimes they graduate when there's new retail opportunities or technologies taking"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"off."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Boom."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"It depends."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"The world you're entering into is very different."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"So we're doing '99."
01:19:09;01:19:15;"The number five song in '99, Jennifer Lopez, ""If You Had My Love."""
01:19:15;01:19:17;"August of '99."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"That sound is already just so '99."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"So is it like a harpsichord?"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Like a fake harpsichord?"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"Yeah, it could be a keyboard."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Like a Korg guitar sound or something."
01:19:26;01:19:27;"Who knows?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"Or a harpsichord."
01:19:29;01:19:37;"This song is dope, though."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Are you a fan?"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"This was her breakout hit, right?"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"This was her first."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Produced by Rodney Jerkins."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"Great producer."
01:19:44;01:19:56;"Michael Jackson showed interest in this song, but felt that it was better suited for a female"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"artist."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Yeah, you can actually really picture it."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"He would murder this."
01:20:00;01:20:20;"This is how it's got to be."
01:20:20;01:20:47;"Classic."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"The number five song on iTunes right now."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Something new."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"We haven't heard this on the show yet."
01:20:52;01:20:57;"This is an interesting one, because I first heard this song not on Time Crisis, not in"
01:20:57;01:21:01;"an Uber, not in a business establishment."
01:21:01;01:21:06;"I heard it in a commercial, I guess for the Apple HomePod, where DJ Khaled and his son"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"are yelling at each other."
01:21:07;01:21:12;"And it's a DJ Khaled song called ""No Brainer"" featuring Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper,"
01:21:12;01:21:19;"and Quavo."
01:21:19;01:21:46;"It's like a sequel of sorts to I'm the One."
01:21:46;01:22:08;"Yeah, that makes the JLo sound positively Baroque comparison."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"I mean, it's very careful."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Right."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Yeah, is this one of those songs?"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"It's also funny too, I don't know if it's always been this way, but I hear that song"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"the first time and I'm like, I have nothing against it."
01:22:20;01:22:24;"It's not very exciting to me, but I also just look at the names and I'm just like, I will"
01:22:24;01:22:28;"probably hear this song 700 times and then eventually I'll be like, ""Well, you know,"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"it's a very catchy song."""
01:22:29;01:22:33;"You'll hear it a lot for the next four and a half months and then never again."
01:22:33;01:22:37;"Right, but generally it seems like things are too big to fail today."
01:22:37;01:22:43;"Like a DJ Khaled song coming out and just dropping off the charts, I don't think that"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"happens."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"It at least get like a pretty big wave of initial enthusiasm."
01:22:46;01:22:47;"I don't know."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"Who cares?"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"The number four song in 99."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"This is a big one."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"Okay."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Heads up."
01:22:54;01:22:59;"I feel like we've riffed on this song on a show before."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Well, this song is basically a meme now."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Right."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"The kids love to joke about it."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"Forehead."
01:23:04;01:23:15;"Do you have any memory of when the song first came out?"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"Didn't make sense."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"No."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"It was the type of thing you'd hear on the radio and you're driving for Papa John's?"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Oh yeah."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Did you think it was remotely cool?"
01:23:21;01:23:22;"No."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"It gave me kind of like a Mighty Mighty Boston's."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"I think Mighty Mighty Boston's are cool."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"I mean, I probably like it more now than I did then."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Did you know who Smash Mouth was?"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"No, I only knew that song."
01:23:27;01:23:34;"Well, before that, the previous album, they had a song, ""You might as well be walking"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"on the sun."""
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Oh yeah."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"Sure, I knew that."
01:23:37;01:23:45;"No, I mean, I guess my perspective on it back then was sort of like, this is like major"
01:23:45;01:23:49;"label, like fake, like alternative rock or something."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"I was just like, this is garbage."
01:23:51;01:23:56;"Like, this was the same league as like Third Eye Blind and Three Doors Down and that kind"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"of stuff."
01:23:57;01:24:25;"Although I would say this."
01:24:25;01:24:26;"Yeah?"
01:24:26;01:24:33;"I would listen to the song, but if like Korn or Marilyn Manson came on the radio, I would"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"change the station."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"Too heavy?"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Yeah."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"A 99 or like Limp Bizkit."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Yeah, you weren't checking for that stuff."
01:24:38;01:24:44;"I was like checking out the alt rock radio station and you'd catch this and maybe you'd"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"catch like..."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Fastball?"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"Yeah, exactly."
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Yeah, Fastball."
01:24:48;01:24:53;"I'd be like, I can hang with this or like Semi Sonic or whatever."
01:24:53;01:24:56;"And then it would go to like Korn and Limp Bizkit and I'd be like, I got to bail."
01:24:56;01:25:03;"The number four song in 2018, Girls Like You, Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B."
01:25:03;01:25:18;"24 hours, I need more hours with you."
01:25:18;01:25:38;"We spent the weekend getting even."
01:25:38;01:26:06;"I need a girl like you."
01:26:06;01:26:09;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"What are the lyrics to this?"
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Oh yeah."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"I like all that palm muting on the acoustics."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"I do like the guitar."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"I took a whole day up, trying to get way up."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"We spent the day like trying to make it up."
01:26:15;01:26:31;"The lyrics are very strange."
01:26:31;01:26:36;"Because girls like you run around with guys like me till sundown."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"When I come through, I need a girl like you."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Yeah, yeah."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"They worked these lyrics hard."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Girls like you love fun."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Yeah, me too."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"What I want when I come through, I need a girl like you."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Yeah."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Maroon 5 has had interesting lyrics in the past."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Dude, Adam Levine was sitting on those lyrics for years."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Who knows if he wrote them?"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"He was just waiting for the right song to come around."
01:26:55;01:26:56;"It's very circular reasoning."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Because girls like you run around with guys like me till sundown."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"When I come through, I need a girl like you."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"I need a girl like you."
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Why do you need a girl like me?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Because girls like you go with guys like me."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Can you be a little more specific?"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"We both run around till sundown and we both love fun."
01:27:09;01:27:14;"It sounds a little bit like if train A is headed for the destination from 2.30, it's"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"one of those equations."
01:27:15;01:27:20;"Maybe it's a commentary on there's no magic in this world."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Everything's kind of predestined."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"I think you're overthinking it, man."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"What do you think it means?"
01:27:24;01:27:30;"I think it's just like, sugar, you are my candy girl."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"And you got me wanting you."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"It's like an Archie song, dude."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"It's the Archies in 2018."
01:27:36;01:27:40;"I can also imagine many songwriters, myself included, will come up with the melody first."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"Sometimes you have a really good melody."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"Sometimes it's kind of complicated."
01:27:45;01:27:49;"The faster the melody is, the more dire it can be sometimes."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Can you fit lyrics that fit the song?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"You got to record it today."
01:27:52;01:27:59;"So somebody was like, maybe it's because girls like you find a spot on me."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"If need a girl like you."
01:28:01;01:28:05;"Then kind of like, girl like you run around with guys like me."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And the sun down I come through."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"I need a girl like you."
01:28:08;01:28:11;"And also the way he sings it, it's very unclear."

01:28:15;01:28:17;"We spent the late nights making things right between us."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"But now it's all good, baby."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Roll that backwood, baby."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"And play me close."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Roll that what?"
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Backwood?"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"It's the most expensive rap to use when rolling blunts."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"It's something that rappers say."
01:28:28;01:28:32;"Dude, remember in that Metallica documentary when they're writing lyrics with their therapist?"
01:28:32;01:28:36;"He's like, yeah, dude, my lifestyle is my death style."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Your lifestyle determines your death style."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"That's like what this is the same."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"That means something, though."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"The way you live your life determines how it's going to end."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"Obviously, you are what you eat."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"Yeah, at least that means something."
01:28:48;01:28:52;"Now, OK, I'm not mad at it, but girl like you is a real head scratcher for me."
01:28:52;01:28:57;"It's neither like vibey, poetic, surrealistical where you're just kind of like, I don't know"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"what he meant, but it's like I get a vibe off."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"It's not that type of lyric."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Most Maroon 5 songs feel a little more specific."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Throw in the Archies, dude."
01:29:04;01:29:09;"I really feel like it's the same emotional and lyrical palette."
01:29:09;01:29:16;"This is probably 50 years old."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Sugar."
01:29:17;01:29:20;"Oh, honey, honey."
01:29:20;01:29:24;"You are my candy girl."
01:29:24;01:29:30;"And you got me wanting you."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Honey."
01:29:31;01:29:34;"Oh, sugar, sugar."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"That's it."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"I like that."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"You are my candy girl."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"And you got me wanting you."
01:29:46;01:29:51;"Cardi B. I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you."
01:29:51;01:29:55;"I just can't believe it's true."

01:29:59;01:30:02;"I just can't believe it's true."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"Oh, sugar."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Oh, sick."

01:30:06;01:30:09;"Oh, honey, honey."

01:30:13;01:30:18;"And you got me wanting you."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"Oh, honey."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"Oh, sugar, sugar."
01:30:22;01:30:25;"You are my candy girl."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"And you got me wanting you."
01:30:28;01:30:32;"When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be."
01:30:32;01:30:35;"I know how sweet a kiss could be."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"He knew how sweet a kiss could be."
01:30:38;01:30:42;"Like the summer sunshine pour your sweetness over me."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Oh."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"Pour your sweetness over me."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Oh."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"Pour some sugar on me 20 years earlier."
01:30:51;01:30:53;"I've actually always wondered that if the Def Leppard song--"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"Yeah, they would have some distant childhood memory of this song."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Yeah, it was a reference to this."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"You're so sweet."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Pour a little sugar on me."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Pour a little sugar on me."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Well, I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with--"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Yeah, it's just a little love ditty."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Sometimes a song is basically just like, I like you, and it feels good."
01:31:14;01:31:16;"And it feels good because I like you."
01:31:16;01:31:19;"We're like half of the Everly Brothers catalog."
01:31:19;01:31:21;"No, but their songs are a little more specific."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"Look, we need all types of songs."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"But you know what's also funny hearing that song?"
01:31:26;01:31:30;"It actually has a lot in common vibe-wise with ""Brown Eyed Girl."""
01:31:30;01:31:33;"And you can imagine that, you know, somebody listening to ""Brown Eyed Girl,"""
01:31:33;01:31:36;"that's like the poetic making love in the green--"
01:31:36;01:31:37;"Like ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is about like--"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Behind the stadium."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"""Brown Eyed Girl"" is like so bittersweet."
01:31:41;01:31:45;"About like young love and lost love and change and stuff."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"And memory."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"And memory, yeah."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Seasons."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Days when the rain came."
01:31:50;01:31:51;"And then sugar, sugar--"
01:31:51;01:31:54;"But you know the hilarious thing is like one person listens to ""Sugar, Sugar,"""
01:31:54;01:31:55;"and they get that feeling."
01:31:55;01:31:59;"One person listens to ""Brown Eyed Girl,"" Irish poetry, get the same feeling."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"Who cares?"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"So shout-out to Maroon 5."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"Here's a song that's actually about something."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"I remember the first time I saw the video for this next song."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"What are we, number three of 99?"
01:32:08;01:32:09;"We're number three of 99."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"And it made a big impression on me."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Like I didn't have a lot of context for it."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"Like sometimes you're right about something, sometimes you're wrong."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"Sometimes you see somebody like that person's going to go far and somebody's--"
01:32:19;01:32:23;"I know this seems crazy, but I remember the first time I saw this video--"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"And this is this group's second album, so I was just ignorant."
01:32:26;01:32:30;"I missed the first album just because I wasn't listening to this type of music."
01:32:30;01:32:34;"And I remember I first saw it, I swear, I was sitting in the basement,"
01:32:34;01:32:40;"and I thought to myself, that one person in this group has such charisma."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"She's such a good performer."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"She's beautiful."
01:32:43;01:32:47;"I just remember being like 14, and as a 14-year-old you see a beautiful woman."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"You're just kind of like, there's something there."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"-Destinies? -And it was Destiny's Child."
01:32:51;01:32:55;"Clearly I was not the only person thinking this, but it always lodged in my brain."
01:32:55;01:32:58;"I remember vividly the first time I saw Beyonce."
01:32:58;01:33:01;"I was thinking either NSYNC or Destiny's, and then you said woman."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Right. Honestly, I didn't have the same feeling about NSYNC."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"I would have picked Joey Fatone as the one to go to the distance."
01:33:07;01:33:09;"I was like, he just seemed more solid."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"But when I first saw Destiny's Child, I just remember I really had this feeling."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"It was the first time I saw Beyonce, and I was like,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"there's something special about that person."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"-Nailed it. -And I was--"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"-Talent scout over here. -I could have been a talent scout."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"Yeah, but you know what's funny?"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"I'm right about stuff like that 1 in 15 times."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"-That's a great ratio, man. -No, it's not a good ratio."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"-Oh. -If I worked at a record label, I'd be awful."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"-Yeah, I would suck. -I would really be bad at it."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"That's why it's notable."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Like, oh, shit comes out, I'm just like, that's fucking sucks."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"That other thing rules. I'm always wrong."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"But this was the one time I was right."
01:33:40;01:33:44;"Very similar sound to If You Had My Love."
01:33:44;01:33:48;"-I think this was also Rodney Jerkins, right? -Weird harpsichord."
01:33:48;01:33:52;"No, this one's not Rodney Jerkins, although he did work with Beyonce later."
01:33:52;01:33:58;"At first we started out real cool"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"Taking me places I ain't never been"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"But now you're getting comfortable"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Ain't doing those things you did no more"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"You're slowly making me pay for things"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"-Your money should be paying for me -Man, '99 was a long time ago."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"-Basically 20 years ago. -That's crazy, dude."
01:34:12;01:34:17;"It's crazy that my 20th college reunion's coming up next year."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Damn, you gonna go?"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"-You know what's really intense, man? -Yeah?"
01:34:21;01:34:25;"I don't know. I remember when I went to college in '95."
01:34:25;01:34:30;"I went to school in Oregon, and my parents had gone to school in California."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"And so the same month that I started school in Oregon,"
01:34:33;01:34:39;"they went to their 25th college reunion in 1995."
01:34:39;01:34:42;"-You rolled out to the West Coast together. -So they had an 18-year-old"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"who was a freshman in college, and then they were, you know..."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"-That'd be like you had a 13-year-old right now. -Yeah."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"Also, I vividly remember it. I was like, ""This song is great."""
01:35:01;01:35:04;"I love the groove and the cadence of the vocals."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"That woman is a star."
01:35:06;01:35:09;"And it kind of reminds me of Hotel California."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"-Those are all the things I thought. -Oh, yeah, it does kind of..."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"-Yeah. -I never really loved this one."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"It's a little too, like, proggy."
01:35:15;01:35:18;"-It's just real herky-jerky, kind of like... -Right."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"-It's just like... -But the vocals are so good."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"It's too complex for my taste."

01:48:22;01:48:24;"Like medical context or something?"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Yeah."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"This is just like straight up like,"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"""Hormones are racing at the speed of light."""
01:48:30;01:48:32;"Who wrote this song? David Frank,"

01:48:34;01:48:36;"Okay, so she didn't write the lyrics."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"But there's also something funny, it's about like,"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"the first verse is talking about"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"teen horniness"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"in this like super grandiose poetic terms,"

01:49:02;01:49:04;"I guess racing at the speed of light is poetic."

01:49:32;01:49:34;"so I wonder if there was--"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Maybe she was like 20 or something."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"No, she might have been younger than 18."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"I wonder if there was a thought--"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"'cause this is the big first single"

01:49:48;01:49:50;"what tone are we trying to strike here?"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"Or maybe they wrote the song not even for her, I don't know."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"'Cause later in her career was when she"

01:50:02;01:50:04;"It's weird. I wonder if"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"abstinence-only,"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"religious-type people heard this song"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"and they were like, ""Thank you."""

01:50:14;01:50:16;"I like the part about it doesn't have to be tonight,"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"and I like the part about being locked away,"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"and I like that the genie's within a bottle."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"What about all this rub-me-the-right-way stuff?"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"Also, the delivery's very sultry."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"They're kind of trying to have it"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"both ways, I guess, with this song."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Riding that fine line."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"It made me think also about the Spice Girls."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"It was kind of similar, that it was"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"a song seeming a little bit about sex"

01:51:14;01:51:16;"Yeah. They were kind of positioned"
01:51:16;01:51:18;"against each other? I thought Britney"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"was sort of the more wholesome,"

01:51:22;01:51:24;"""Bad Men"" era, ""Girl Next Door"" or something."

01:51:26;01:51:28;"I think there's an element of that. Is that...?"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Whatever. Anyway, the number one song"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"in 2018, also 3 minutes"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"38 seconds. The first time I heard this song"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"was on this show. And I said,"

01:51:38;01:51:40;"This is one of those songs that now, because it's a meme,"

01:51:44;01:51:46;"Are you aware of the ""In My Feelings"" dancing"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"and stuff, and people jump out of the car"

01:51:50;01:51:52;"I've heard ""Kiki, do you love me?"""
01:51:52;01:51:54;"Well, if it was on the show, probably."
01:51:54;01:52:00;"Is this Post?"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"No, this is Drake. Oh."
01:52:02;01:52:10;"Kiki? Yeah."
01:52:10;01:52:14;"Like, K-I-K-I?"
01:52:14;01:52:18;"Like a woman's name."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"I don't know."
01:52:50;01:52:52;"The funny part is that the hit part"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"of this song is literally the first"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"10 seconds. It's the ""Kiki,"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"do you love me?"" You haven't been"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"hearing that around? No. Well, it's a big"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"old hit. For the next"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"few months. When was the last time you heard"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"""Hotline Bling""? Not much,"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"but you know, that's the thing. Rap moves faster."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"Is that what it is? I just, it's weird to me"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"that songs are everywhere"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"for a few months, and then they're just gone."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Well, somebody like Drake has so much music,"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"and he's had so many hits"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"and so many culturally important,"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"impactful songs. I was thinking"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"about that, like, we're rolling up to these festivals,"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"no new music. Yeah."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"Just busting out ""Oxford Comma."""
01:53:28;01:53:30;"Yep. Heard that on the"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"drive the other day."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"That song's been out for 10 years."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Yeah. It was written 12 years ago."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"But for me, it doesn't feel that old."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"I don't know if I'm just, if I'm tripping or something,"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"but this is probably wishful thinking, but"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"I almost feel like, whatever your timeline,"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"it's only as far away as"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"however much music you released in between."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"So between Drake's first album and"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"now, he's been on hundreds"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"of songs. Between Vampire"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Weekend's first album and now, I've"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"been part of 25 songs."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"No, more than that. Two"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"albums and a handful of other things. It's not a lot."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Well, three albums."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"Between-- I mean, first, yeah, I don't know. Okay."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"I don't know what I'm saying. I gotcha. If you're not worried"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"about having hits or being, like, an important part of culture,"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"you can just take your sweet time."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"That's what I'm doing."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"Taking the long game. Still working on my"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"first solo album. You know what's funny?"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"The other day, it just popped into my head,"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"like, ""Jake should drop an album."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"I wanna see, like, a Jake Longstreth"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"vinyl."" That's tight. Have you"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"thought about it? Yeah, I have songs I've written."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"I just have to get it together to record it"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"with Dick Bix. They'd be the band? Yeah."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Have me and Ariel produce it."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Okay. Do two days."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Exactly, yeah. Do it fast. Two days"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"at Vox. We, like, rehearse it for a"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"day or two. Yeah. So everyone knows it and then"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"come in and just crush it. You can take your time with the vocals,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"but have to get the tracks done. Mountain Bruise,"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"dude. Is that what it's gonna be called? Yeah."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Jake Longstreth, Mountain Bruise? Mm-hmm. That's"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"great. Coming out in, like, 2021."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"Yeah. Like I said, taking my time."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"How many songs do you have? Probably, like, ten."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"You already have ten. I got a Tequila Noon."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"I'm playing"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"it on my other song titles."
01:55:02;01:55:04;"Oh, Spring Wind. Love that."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"Is Sweet Chili Heat too jokey?"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"That's for a different project? Oh, yeah, maybe I could rewrite that."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Yeah. Yeah, like, if you could be-- Spring Wind."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Instead of Sweet Chili Heat, if you wanted"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"to, like, class it up, it could be, like,"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"on, like, Sweet Desert Heat. Oh, yeah."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"It's about, like, you driving through Arizona. Or you could"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"do, like, you could do one with, like--"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Sweet Mountain Heat."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Or, like, uh,"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"like Tequila and Weed."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"You could do kind of, like-- Tequila and Weed."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"You could do, like--"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"This would be the second Tequila."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I always think that's"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"kind of cool when, like, an artist"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"has, like, a couple interrelated"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"songs, and they never explain why."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"It's like Stone Roses have a couple"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"different stone songs. Right."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"So it's like Jake Longstreet's Mountain Bruise"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"and just, like, track one, Tequila Noon."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"Track seven, Tequila and Weed."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Yeah. It's like, you don't go crazy. It's not"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"three songs. Yeah. It's not, like-- It's not four."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"It's just two. Just a theme."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"Yeah, exactly. All right, well,"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"let's table that. Mountain Bruise"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"coming out on Numero Group."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"[laughs]"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"2020. Love it."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"All right. We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"Peace with Ezra King."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be"
