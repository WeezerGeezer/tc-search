00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, late March."
00:04;00:08;"We'll be talking to Lush Life, my old friend."
00:08;00:13;"Plus, Jonathan Wolfe, composer of the Seinfeld theme song."
00:13;00:19;"All this, plus we count down the hits of 1989 and today."
00:19;00:23;"It's almost spring, and this is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:27;00:31;"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-spot one."
00:31;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:37;00:44;"The war I felt, wobbly me, all my rightful chances."
00:44;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
00:59;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:09;01:14;"Leave a lonely man."
01:14;01:16;"Time Crisis, we're back."
01:16;01:17;"What's up, Jake?"
01:17;01:18;"Hey."
01:18;01:19;"How you doing, man?"
01:19;01:20;"Pretty good."
01:20;01:22;"Did you listen to the new Drake playlist?"
01:22;01:23;"No."
01:23;01:24;"Do you care about Drake?"
01:24;01:26;"No, I mean, I'm fine with them, but I don't--"
01:26;01:27;"You respect Drake?"
01:27;01:28;"Yeah, sure."
01:28;01:33;"But so when a new Drake album or playlist comes out,"
01:33;01:34;"you're not rushing to listen to it?"
01:34;01:36;"Didn't even hear about it."
01:36;01:37;"You didn't know that he dropped a new playlist?"
01:37;01:39;"How would I know about that?"
01:39;01:40;"Where do you first see that?"
01:40;01:42;"Where do I first see that?"
01:42;01:47;"Something like that I'd probably first see on social media."
01:47;01:48;"Okay, so you're on Twitter."
01:48;01:49;"You wake up--"
01:49;01:51;"I don't check Twitter every day, but--"
01:51;01:52;"Really?"
01:52;01:53;"Yeah, no."
01:53;01:54;"I find that shocking."
01:54;01:55;"I've been weaning myself off."
01:55;01:56;"It's toxic right now."
01:56;01:57;"It's brutal."
01:57;01:58;"Nobody needs to check Twitter every day."
01:58;02:00;"But I think somebody just told me,"
02:00;02:01;"""Oh, the new Drake thing is out."""
02:01;02:03;"So like a friend texted you?"
02:03;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:05;"Was like, ""Oh, did you hear that?"""
02:05;02:07;"Yeah, because there's a lot of people that I know"
02:07;02:11;"who would be like, ""What do you think of the new Drake?"""
02:11;02:13;"I need an answer."
02:13;02:15;"But Drake made-- it's not an album, it's a playlist."
02:15;02:17;"Kind of like my Home Depot playlist?"
02:17;02:19;"Well, it's all original music."
02:19;02:20;"Oh."
02:20;02:22;"It's presented as a playlist."
02:22;02:23;"Is it a little more casual than--"
02:23;02:24;"Yeah, maybe it's a little more casual."
02:24;02:26;"There's some like fun moments where people are just talking."
02:26;02:28;"It's like a lateral move from a mixtape?"
02:28;02:30;"That's a good way to look at it."
02:30;02:34;"But everybody was talking about it when it came out last week."
02:34;02:35;"Haven't heard it."
02:35;02:36;"You haven't heard any of it?"
02:36;02:37;"Nope."
02:37;02:39;"I mentioned to you that there was a reference on it."
02:39;02:42;"So this is a song called ""Lose You."""
02:42;02:44;"I don't care what society thinks."
02:44;02:45;"They're nothing anyway."
02:45;02:47;"They're no better than me."
02:47;02:49;"You just have to fit into a pattern."
02:49;02:50;"If somebody's on a hit, I'm for you."
02:50;02:52;"The life we live, you have to set your own patterns,"
02:52;02:53;"your own ideals."
02:53;02:55;"You have to handle the whole job yourself."
02:55;02:57;"Yeah."
02:57;03:00;"That's a Canadian biker speaking."
03:00;03:01;"Like bicyclist?"
03:01;03:04;"No, like a Hells Angel type."
03:04;03:05;"Oh, like a--"
03:05;03:07;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
03:07;03:09;"Oh, you get the idea of the vibe of the song."
03:09;03:11;"There's a specific line I wanted you to hear."
03:11;03:13;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
03:13;03:16;"Drake often has songs like this on his albums,"
03:16;03:19;"mixtapes, whatever, that's kind of like where he's"
03:19;03:20;"kind of in a reflective mode."
03:20;03:23;"And he's kind of thinking about how he can't trust anybody,"
03:23;03:25;"and how there's so many fake people,"
03:25;03:29;"and how the more famous and rich you get, you get new problems."
03:29;03:31;"He always has these songs where he's kind of like--"
03:31;03:33;"Did he do ""Straight to my face?"""
03:33;03:34;"Is that Drake?"
03:34;03:35;"""Straight up to my face?"""
03:35;03:37;"Yeah, about people who lie to you."
03:37;03:40;"So he's really on that Bob Dylan, Positively 4th Street"
03:40;03:41;"tip."
03:41;03:43;"He loves that mode."
03:43;03:47;"Of just being like, yeah, all the fake people who you just"
03:47;03:49;"want to be on the side that's winning."
03:49;03:50;"Yeah."
03:50;03:51;"So--"
03:51;03:53;"When I was down, you just stood there grinning."
03:53;03:58;"And it's kind of like, oh, you liked me when I was starting."
03:58;04:00;"People don't like you once you've made it."
04:00;04:01;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
04:01;04:03;"Be honest with myself and take ownership."
04:03;04:05;"Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn."
04:05;04:07;"I really used to feel like they loved the [BLEEP]"
04:07;04:08;"at first."
04:08;04:11;"Exciting times revitalized, trust this little light of mine."
04:11;04:13;"It's going to shine positively."
04:13;04:14;"But listen to this."
04:14;04:17;"I'm mistaken, but God will give me."
04:17;04:19;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:19;04:21;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:21;04:22;"I did."
04:22;04:23;"Rewind."
04:23;04:25;"What did you say, Drake?"
04:25;04:27;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:27;04:29;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:29;04:31;"I don't catch in flies and honey, it's still sticky."
04:31;04:32;"I wrote the book--"
04:32;04:33;"Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:33;04:37;"So to anybody at home who doesn't know what Drake means"
04:37;04:41;"when he says that he's grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey,"
04:41;04:43;"he's referencing the Grateful Dead, one of Jake's"
04:43;04:44;"all-time favorite bands."
04:44;04:47;"He rhymes Mickey with give me."
04:47;04:49;"No, well, he-- no, then he says sticky."
04:49;04:50;"Listen to the whole line."
04:50;04:51;"Oh, wait."
04:51;04:52;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:52;04:54;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:54;04:56;"I don't catch in flies and honey, it's still sticky."
04:56;04:57;"OK."
04:57;04:58;"No, is that--"
04:58;04:59;"That's a good point."
04:59;05:02;"Is that a reference to the Grateful Dead honey bear?"
05:02;05:04;"You know, one of their logos is like the bear?"
05:04;05:05;"I don't think so."
05:05;05:06;"[LAUGHS]"
05:06;05:08;"But anyway, the main thing I want to talk about"
05:08;05:11;"is I feel like the Grateful Dead doesn't get a ton of shout outs"
05:11;05:17;"in modern pop music, let alone name-checking three members."
05:17;05:21;"Like, first of all, Jerry Garcia is an icon, very famous."
05:21;05:23;"Bob Weir, to a lesser extent."
05:23;05:24;"Mickey, that's deep."
05:24;05:25;"Mickey Hart."
05:25;05:27;"Mickey Hart is the drummer."
05:27;05:28;"Second drummer."
05:28;05:29;"Second drummer in the Dead."
05:29;05:32;"You know, I'm sure Drake chose it for the rhyme"
05:32;05:33;"because Mickey rhymes with sticky."
05:33;05:34;"Yeah."
05:34;05:39;"The one tough thing about this is that as much as I'm sure"
05:39;05:41;"the living members of the Grateful Dead"
05:41;05:44;"appreciate the shout out, perhaps just due"
05:44;05:49;"to syllabic constraints, Drake did not shout out"
05:49;05:50;"every member of the band."
05:50;05:52;"Didn't shout out Phil Lesh."
05:52;05:54;"And he specifically didn't shout out Phil Lesh,"
05:54;05:55;"who's the bassist."
05:55;06:01;"Kind of like the sweet-natured, often forgotten bassist."
06:01;06:04;"Doesn't have the flash of the Jerry, Bob, or Mickey."
06:04;06:05;"Iconic in his own right."
06:06;06:09;"So, you know, just imagine that you're Phil Lesh's"
06:09;06:13;"grandchildren, and you hear that your grandpa's band"
06:13;06:15;"got shouted out on a Drake song."
06:15;06:16;"I think that's pretty cool."
06:16;06:20;"And you're like, Grandpa Phil, the biggest rapper in the world,"
06:20;06:23;"just shouted out Grateful Dead on his new playlist."
06:23;06:24;"And Phil Lesh's like, oh, I didn't know Drake"
06:24;06:25;"had a new playlist."
06:25;06:26;"That's pretty cool."
06:26;06:28;"He's like, what is a playlist?"
06:28;06:31;"No, I think Phil Lesh is up on that."
06:31;06:32;"Oh, that's interesting."
06:32;06:34;"Drake's always having fun with the album form."
06:34;06:35;"What did he say?"
06:35;06:39;"And they said, well, he said he's grateful,"
06:39;06:41;"like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
06:41;06:45;"And Phil Lesh says, hmm, okay."
06:45;06:48;"Mickey wasn't even a founding member."
06:48;06:50;"Well, that's great, guys."
06:50;06:54;"Couldn't he have gone grateful like Jerry, Bob, Phil, and Mickey?"
06:54;06:55;"Just cram it in."
06:55;06:57;"I'm just taking what God will give me."
06:57;06:59;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
06:59;07:02;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
07:02;07:04;"I know catching flies with honey is still sticky."
07:04;07:07;"I wrote the book on world-class finesses and tasteful gestures"
07:07;07:09;"and making efforts and never placing second."
07:09;07:12;"Even better, knowing you first, but then taking second."
07:12;07:14;"Inspiring and never taking credit."
07:14;07:15;"I know I deserve more."
07:15;07:16;"I just never said it."
07:16;07:19;"Two middle fingers as I make an exit."
07:19;07:20;"Yeah."
07:20;07:23;"Did I lose you?"
07:23;07:24;"Did I?"
07:25;07:28;"Did I lose you?"
07:28;07:29;"Did I?"
07:30;07:32;"Did I lose you?"
07:35;07:43;"Winning is problematic."
07:43;07:46;"People like you more when you working towards something,"
07:46;07:47;"not when you have it."
07:47;07:49;"Way less support from my peers in recent years"
07:49;07:51;"as I get established."
07:51;07:53;"Unforgiving times, but I manage."
07:53;07:55;"Why is my struggle different than others?"
07:55;07:58;"Only child is taking care of his mother."
07:58;08:00;"His health worsens, his bills double."
08:00;08:01;"That's not respectable."
08:01;08:04;"All of a sudden, I don't get a pat on the back for the come up."
08:04;08:06;"What do you see when you see me?"
08:06;08:09;"When did all the things I mean from the bottom of my heart"
08:09;08:10;"start to lose meaning?"
08:10;08:12;"Maybe I shared with too many people."
08:12;08:15;"Back then, the usages feel like our secret."
08:15;08:17;"Back when I would write and not think about how to receive it,"
08:17;08:21;"I'd be trying to manifest the things I needed."
08:21;08:24;"And look now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me."
08:24;08:29;"But you're mindful of it all when you're mindful of it all."
08:29;08:31;"How'd it go from not wanting me at all"
08:31;08:34;"to wanting to see me lose it all?"
08:34;08:36;"Things get dark when my heart just starts glowing."
08:36;08:39;"I'm overcome with emotions, ones I can't access"
08:39;08:40;"when I'm stone sober."
08:40;08:43;"Jealous ones still envy and turn King Cobra."
08:43;08:45;"I could only speak what I know."
08:45;08:47;"Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinking"
08:47;08:49;"and Icy Hanna can drink it."
08:49;08:52;"And rival neighborhoods linking and putting your trust"
08:52;08:55;"in someone with the risk of financially sinking."
08:55;08:58;"All you did was write the book on garbage-ass rollies,"
08:58;09:00;"ego stroking, picture posting."
09:00;09:03;"Claiming that you do it for motivational purposes only,"
09:03;09:05;"but you just had to show me."
09:05;09:08;"See, I know 'cause I study you closely."
09:08;09:10;"I know when someone lying."
09:10;09:12;"I know there's people standing for nothing or getting tired."
09:12;09:15;"I know what we're both thinking even when you're quiet."
09:15;09:18;"Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you."
09:18;09:21;"Did I?"
09:21;09:22;"Did I?"
09:22;09:25;"Did I lose you?"
09:25;09:26;"Did I?"
09:26;09:28;"Did I?"
09:28;09:30;"Did I lose you?"
09:30;09:36;"Wait, is Phil the only person that he's really passing over here?"
09:36;09:38;"Well, no. There's Pigpen."
09:38;09:39;"There's Pigpen."
09:39;09:40;"R.I.P. He died in like 1970."
09:40;09:41;"He died early."
09:41;09:45;"And then there's Keith Godchow, who replaced Pigpen."
09:45;09:46;"But he's kind of like a touring member?"
09:46;09:49;"Yeah, I mean, he was probably in the mid-'70s records."
09:49;09:52;"Well, that's not fair either, but definitely the most egregious."
09:52;09:54;"Donna Godchow as well."
09:54;09:55;"Oh, his wife?"
09:55;09:56;"Yeah."
09:56;09:57;"She play a little fiddle too?"
09:57;09:58;"No, I think just vocals."
09:58;09:59;"Oh, I'm thinking somebody else."
09:59;10:01;"But Phil is definitely the most egregious omission here."
10:01;10:02;"Yeah."
10:02;10:05;"Mickey Hart, interesting story."
10:05;10:07;"One of their great songs is called ""He's Gone."""
10:07;10:08;"Mm-hmm."
10:08;10:10;"It's on Europe 72."
10:10;10:13;"But anyway, that's about Mickey Hart's dad who was managing the dead."
10:13;10:14;"Oh, and ripping them off?"
10:14;10:18;"And then stole a bunch of their money and then absconded."
10:18;10:22;"Just vaporized, left, and then so they wrote ""He's Gone"" about it."
10:22;10:28;"It's one thing to steal money, but to abscond with it is--"
10:28;10:29;"that's hitting somebody one day."
10:29;10:31;"And I think-- I could be getting this wrong,"
10:31;10:34;"but I feel like the vibe was so bad after that"
10:34;10:36;"that they kicked Mickey Hart out"
10:36;10:40;"because Bill Kreutzman is the only drummer on the Europe 72 album."
10:40;10:44;"But then Mickey Hart came back mid-'70s."
10:44;10:47;"I think for a while they had to just be like, ""Dude, your dad ripped us off."
10:47;10:49;"You're not going on this tour."""
10:49;10:51;"That's a tough position to be in if your dad ripped off the band."
10:51;10:52;"Can you imagine?"
10:52;10:53;"That's rough."
10:53;10:57;"Also, I got to say, I wish there were tapes of them talking about that"
10:57;10:59;"because it must be hilarious."
10:59;11:02;"Because that must just be some straight-up Big Lebowski sh--"
11:02;11:08;"is a bunch of zonked-out hippies talking about financial matters."
11:08;11:10;"That is always funny."
11:10;11:11;"Oh my God."
11:11;11:17;"Just kind of like, ""Mickey, man, your dad made off with the bread, man."
11:17;11:19;"You know, we were out there touring, man."
11:19;11:25;"And yeah, your dad took the bread and he absconded, man."
11:25;11:29;"He absconded with the bread, man."
11:29;11:31;"Bob, am I wrong here?"
11:31;11:36;"No, Jerry, that's a real harsh move your dad pulled, man."
11:36;11:37;"That's not cool."""
11:37;11:38;"That's a real harsh toke."
11:38;11:42;"That's a real harsh toke, Mickey."
11:42;11:49;"And like, ""I don't know if I'm comfortable with the son of a bread absconder"
11:49;11:53;"keeping time behind me, man."""
11:53;11:57;"We just got to move forward here, guys."
11:57;11:59;"We got to."
11:59;12:01;"What's done is done."
12:01;12:03;"Yeah."
12:03;12:08;"Water under the bridge, man, but that's not cool."
12:08;12:12;"That's a harsh toke on the bong of existence."
12:12;12:14;"They got it together."
12:21;12:25;"You know better but I know him"
12:25;12:37;"Like I told you, what I said"
12:37;12:43;"Steal your face right off your head"
12:48;12:53;"Now he's gone"
12:53;13:00;"Now he's gone"
13:00;13:04;"But he's gone"
13:04;13:07;"He's gone"
13:07;13:16;"Like a steam locomotive"
13:16;13:19;"Running down the track"
13:19;13:21;"He's gone"
13:23;13:26;"But he's gonna bring him back"
13:26;13:30;"He's gone"
13:30;13:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
13:33;13:36;"Well, anyway, that's quite a start to the show."
13:36;13:38;"We already talked about Drake and the Grateful Dead."
13:38;13:41;"We got a big one coming up, Jake."
13:41;13:45;"We have two guests today calling in."
13:45;13:47;"We're going to be talking about Ed Sheeran."
13:47;13:50;"We're going to be talking about Mike Sheeran."
13:50;13:52;"The Ed Sheeran news just doesn't stop."
13:52;13:53;"Oh, there's news?"
13:53;13:54;"Oh, yeah, there's news."
13:54;13:55;"We'll get into that a little bit later."
13:55;13:57;"But the two guests we have today,"
13:57;13:59;"one is my buddy Raj,"
13:59;14:02;"also professionally known as the rapper Lush Life,"
14:02;14:03;"who I grew up with."
14:03;14:07;"He wrote a great moving op-ed for the Washington Post recently"
14:07;14:09;"about the violence against South Asians"
14:09;14:10;"that's been happening in America."
14:10;14:12;"So he's going to call in, going to catch up and talk."
14:12;14:14;"And then on a lighter note,"
14:14;14:16;"we also have Jonathan Wolfe,"
14:16;14:18;"the composer of the Seinfeld theme."
14:18;14:21;"We've really gotten some, like, top-shelf guests."
14:21;14:22;"That's big, man."
14:22;14:23;"Yeah, I know."
14:23;14:25;"[imitates guitar]"
14:25;14:26;"I just want to point out, you know,"
14:26;14:28;"when Sound Crisis first started,"
14:28;14:31;"I'll admit we had some real top-shelf guests."
14:31;14:33;"We had stars of films and programs."
14:33;14:35;"We came out of the gate hot, yep."
14:35;14:37;"We had Jamie Foxx."
14:37;14:38;"That was memorable."
14:39;14:41;"One day maybe we'll get back to that,"
14:41;14:43;"the real high-level stars."
14:43;14:44;"In the meantime,"
14:44;14:47;"between the Seinfeld theme song composer"
14:47;14:50;"and the invention of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel,"
14:50;14:53;"I think we're getting coverage on Time Crisis"
14:53;14:55;"that you're really not going to find anywhere else."
14:55;14:58;"You're listening to..."
14:58;15:01;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
15:01;15:02;"A lot of breath."
15:03;15:05;"A lot of bread, man."
15:05;15:07;"That was a lot of bread"
15:07;15:10;"that your dad, like, absconded with, man."
15:10;15:13;"And... [laughs]"
15:13;15:17;"Oh, man, that was just Mickey in the hot seat."
15:17;15:18;"Okay, but anyway,"
15:18;15:20;"just a little bit of background about Raj."
15:20;15:21;"Lush Life."
15:21;15:23;"I call him Raj 'cause I've known him since back in the day."
15:23;15:24;"Yep."
15:24;15:26;"He was almost like a mentor figure for me."
15:26;15:29;"I don't know if it was like this when you went to high school,"
15:29;15:31;"but I was just thinking about this."
15:31;15:32;"Like, when you're in middle school,"
15:32;15:34;"you kind of get to flex a little bit."
15:34;15:35;"Like, you know, if you're in seventh or eighth grade,"
15:35;15:36;"whenever you switch over,"
15:36;15:39;"you're kind of like the big kids in middle school."
15:39;15:41;"And you have a sense of, like, you're 12 or 13."
15:41;15:42;"You're like, ""We made it."""
15:42;15:44;"In the Jewish faith, you even have a bar mitzvah."
15:44;15:46;"All these things are happening at that age"
15:46;15:47;"where you're kind of like, ""We made it."""
15:47;15:49;"And then you turn 14,"
15:49;15:51;"you get knocked right back down to size."
15:51;15:52;"Now you're a freshman."
15:52;15:53;"That's a scary day, man."
15:53;15:54;"You might have been the cock of the walk,"
15:54;15:57;"but now--yeah, fresh-- fresh first day of high school."
15:57;15:58;"First day of high school?"
15:58;15:59;"That's a classic one."
15:59;16:00;"That's--yeah, it's like--"
16:00;16:01;"it makes you think of Freaks and Geeks."
16:01;16:02;"Whoo!"
16:02;16:03;"That's a weird one."
16:03;16:04;"But anyway, so, you know,"
16:04;16:05;"I remember being in freshman high school"
16:05;16:07;"and not knowing if I was gonna--"
16:07;16:09;"what it was gonna be like, and I remember--"
16:09;16:10;"I met a bunch of people."
16:10;16:12;"Raj was a senior when I was a freshman."
16:12;16:13;"We both were into music,"
16:13;16:15;"and very influential person in my life."
16:15;16:16;"Taught me a lot about music,"
16:16;16:19;"and he continues to make music, as do I."
16:19;16:21;"So anyway, Raj is gonna call in"
16:21;16:23;"and talk a little bit about his article."
16:23;16:24;"Cool."

19:00;19:04;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
19:04;19:08;"(Phone ringing)"
19:08;19:09;"What's up, Raj?"
19:09;19:10;"Hey, how's it going, guys?"
19:10;19:11;"Hey, how you doing, man?"
19:11;19:12;"Not bad."
19:12;19:17;"So, it was very cool to see that you had this op-ed in the Washington Post."
19:17;19:18;"Yeah."
19:18;19:25;"The title of the op-ed was ""Indian Americans Won't Be Safe As Long As The White House Is Inciting Fear."""
19:25;19:30;"So, I was curious. I just want to kind of share that with our listeners and talk about what inspired you to write this."
19:30;19:37;"Ever since the election, really, it's been, I think, for everybody, just been confusing time."
19:37;19:42;"And it's just, you know, I've been sort of finding different ways to process it all."
19:42;19:50;"And, you know, I spent basically 10 weeks after the election working on a mixtape that kind of dealt with how we got here and where to go next."
19:50;19:53;"And that was all before the inauguration."
19:53;19:57;"And post-inauguration, things just kind of got worse and worse."
19:57;20:02;"Hate crimes are on the rise, and particularly against Indian Americans, there's a rash of them."
20:02;20:11;"And I felt pretty compelled to speak out because I saw people in my community on social media and elsewhere, you know,"
20:11;20:19;"basically calling on Trump after one of the most egregious ones where, you know, there was actually somebody killed."
20:19;20:22;"It was an Indian engineer working in Kansas for Garmin."
20:22;20:29;"He was shot by his assailant after the assailant yelled, ""Get out of my country,"" or something."
20:29;20:38;"You know, just I saw so many people in my community saying, you know, calling on Trump to denounce the attacks and, you know,"
20:38;20:41;"waiting for him to make some sort of forceful comment on it."
20:41;20:47;"And I just felt like that was a useless approach to tackling the issue,"
20:47;20:57;"because the real story here is that the Trump administration, no matter what sort of lip service they might offer their actions or speaking volumes,"
20:57;21:09;"just in terms of the Muslim ban and, you know, calling for a border wall and pointing Jeff Sessions, who's a racist of epic proportions,"
21:09;21:12;"as attorney general, like, that's the stuff we need to be fighting."
21:12;21:20;"And so I basically wanted to stop everything I was doing and write a piece to call on Indian Americans, South Asians in general,"
21:20;21:27;"to stop asking for apologies for their denouncement of the hate crimes from Trump and to start organizing."
21:27;21:32;"One thing that I found interesting about your piece and that I kind of related to in my own way,"
21:32;21:39;"you point out the need for solidarity across boundaries, because it's kind of interesting in America, like a lot of times we talk about"
21:39;21:43;"sometimes one horrible thing happens to a specific community and we focus on that community,"
21:43;21:48;"but you also were talking about the ways in which it's all kind of interrelated, too."
21:48;21:56;"Well, yeah, with the shooting of Srinivas Kuchipothila in Kansas that I was talking about in the article,"
21:56;22:02;"the person who shot him, the reports say that that person mistook him for a Middle Eastern person."
22:02;22:13;"So ultimately, the anti-immigrant sentiment and policy and xenophobia that's directed at Muslims, it's affecting all of us."
22:13;22:18;"And so there's Islamophobia within the Indian community."
22:18;22:28;"And in the article, I talk about a fundraiser that Trump held in Edison, New Jersey, which is like a big Indian community there in New Jersey."
22:28;22:36;"And I remember it was in like October of last year, and I remember reading a BuzzFeed article about it the day after it happened."
22:36;22:42;"It's just amazing to me, the level of Islamophobia was like a theme of the evening, basically."
22:42;22:46;"Like before Trump spoke at it, they had all this entertainment."
22:46;22:49;"And apparently, like they have videos of it online."
22:49;23:02;"There was this dance sequence where couples are doing like the fox trot and then these terrorists ostensibly with lightsabers come out and start like attacking these dancers."
23:02;23:06;"And then they're rescued by Navy SEALs and then they all start dancing."
23:06;23:08;"They're born in the USA. It's like totally crazy."
23:08;23:11;"So bananas."
23:11;23:17;"But like at that event, Trump said to the audience, I'm a big fan of Hindu."
23:17;23:20;"I just want to point that out because that's jumped out of me in an article."
23:20;23:23;"Trump is at a Hindu American fundraiser."
23:23;23:25;"I imagine there weren't a lot of Muslims in attendance."
23:25;23:31;"And so there's this kind of like bananas, terrorist dancing."
23:31;23:35;"And then when Trump takes the stage, he doesn't say I'm a big fan of the Hindu community."
23:35;23:41;"He literally says the sentence, I'm a big fan of Hindu."
23:41;23:50;"Yeah. And like, you know, fast forward whatever, four months later and he's showing his cards that he's not such a big fan of Hindu."
23:50;23:57;"And he's been reluctant to say anything about any of the recent hate crimes against Indians in this country."
23:57;24:03;"And so, yeah, I mean, I think instead of giving money to politicians, Indian Americans need to run in greater numbers."
24:03;24:13;"And I think we need to cross boundaries, sects of Sikh and Hindu and Muslim and start to realize that there's an attack on us all."
24:13;24:17;"And together is probably the only way we're going to effectively fight it."
24:17;24:20;"So tell me about the grizzly bear cover you just released."
24:20;24:28;"Rough Trade asked me to be part of this great 90 day project that they're doing called The Song of Day Keeps the Pain Away."
24:28;24:39;"And it benefits Southern Poverty Law Center. And they release a song every day for the first 90 days of Trump's administration."
24:39;24:44;"And I decided to cover Grizzly Bear's Foreground, which is one of my favorite songs."
24:44;24:49;"And my read on the song, it's about like a relationship falling apart."
24:49;24:57;"And I kind of projected that on maybe how I'm feeling about my relationship with this country at the moment."
24:57;25:08;"And it's bookended with two verses that take on the issues with xenophobia and nationalism that are at the fore right now."
25:08;25:12;"So, yeah, I released it last week and reception on it's been really great."
25:12;25:14;"And I'd like to play it for you guys."
25:14;25:15;"Cool."
25:16;25:23;"When the waters come crashing down in Babylon, justice of the peace turn around and bangers gavel on people in the streets."
25:23;25:27;"Give them heat if it's Ramadan. They always hated you and always will."
25:27;25:30;"And the Pentagon eyes wide shut on a bomb."
25:30;25:34;"Hella hypocritical when they the only ones holding nuclear arms."
25:34;25:37;"Rap phenomenon, lush V to rock, tell them."
25:37;25:41;"Take away the coffers of the bankers and the war mongerers and expel them."
25:41;25:45;"Follow the motion."
25:45;25:51;"Arms in the air, hands in the air."
25:51;25:57;"Work on another day."
25:57;26:04;"Something's marked, another justice."
26:04;26:15;"It is a foreground."
26:15;26:26;"Oh, those countrymen, take direction, get collected."
26:26;26:38;"I'm afraid they say, dead detected, not in ranking."
26:38;26:44;"Fall in, or take flight."
26:44;26:50;"Have a thought, or push it, soften."
26:50;26:55;"Something about this life."
26:55;27:01;"Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning."
27:01;27:07;"It is a foreground."
27:13;27:24;"Oh, little jimmy, matter evolving, motion and soften."
27:24;27:30;"Something about this life."
27:30;27:48;"Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning."
27:48;27:54;"Matter of fact, I'm the young Abyssinian, young Hindustani, Pakistani and the Indians."
27:54;27:57;"We all look the same, do a merengue condominium."
27:57;28:00;"Look at down plot and how to get us out the paint."
28:00;28:02;"Why they ruin the millennium."
28:02;28:05;"How you gonna practice self-care when you want welfare?"
28:05;28:08;"And the first order of business is to take your health care."
28:08;28:11;"Elsewhere they dropping bombs like lightning."
28:11;28:14;"Wicked white men is hyping men and it's frightening."
28:14;28:18;"I don't need to tell them that the world is steady hanging in the balance, so keep hyping it."
28:18;28:24;"Daily acts of protest, daily acts of unrest, daily acts of violence till they changing in the next step."
28:24;28:28;"Cool, thanks a lot Raj. So you're about to go on tour?"
28:28;28:32;"A little bit later this year, I'm just wrapping up a new record."
28:32;28:35;"Should be done in the next couple of weeks, fingers crossed."
28:35;28:40;"And I don't know if I can allow to talk about this yet, but I just signed a book deal."
28:40;28:42;"So kind of wrapping up some stuff on that."
28:42;28:43;"Oh, sick."
28:43;28:46;"I think we're planning some dates for the summer and onwards."
28:46;28:51;"Awesome. Any final thoughts that you want to leave the Time Crisis listeners with?"
28:51;28:54;"Ah yeah, FDT."
28:54;28:58;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
28:58;29:01;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
29:01;29:02;"One."
29:02;29:06;"Obviously we haven't been going too deep on politics on Time Crisis lately."
29:06;29:11;"We've been sometimes taking a breather to talk about Home Depot and some of the finer things in life."
29:11;29:14;"But of course, it's never far from our minds."
29:14;29:18;"It was really nice to hear from Raj and I really recommend everybody check out his op-ed"
29:18;29:26;"because it kind of shows one of the oldest lessons that we have that no form of hate is tolerable."
29:26;29:30;"It's nice to see obviously people we know educating others."
29:30;29:31;"Yeah, that's great."
29:31;29:37;"Well, what can we do given how horrible the world is,"
29:37;29:40;"given how much we all need to educate ourselves every day,"
29:40;29:44;"continue to donate money to places like the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center."
29:44;29:47;"I get four emails a day from John Ossoff."
29:47;29:48;"Who's that?"
29:48;29:53;"He's a 30-year-old dude running for Congress in Georgia."
29:53;29:59;"Tom Price, who is Trump's appointee to head up the Health and Human Services Department."
29:59;30:00;"Okay."
30:00;30:01;"So he was a congressman from Georgia."
30:01;30:05;"He got the job from Trump, so he vacated his congressional position."
30:05;30:07;"And so there's an open seat."
30:07;30:08;"Oh, in a special election."
30:08;30:11;"In this suburban Atlanta district."
30:11;30:15;"And John Ossoff is a 30-year-old kid, a Democrat, running."
30:15;30:16;"And it's neck and neck."
30:16;30:18;"30-year-old man, Jake."
30:18;30:19;"30-year-old man."
30:19;30:20;"You can't be putting that kind of energy out there."
30:20;30:24;"John Ossoff is a 30-year-old man who is running."
30:24;30:27;"So Trump won that district by a single percentage point."
30:27;30:31;"We got a tie ball game in this district between the Dems and the Republicans."
30:31;30:37;"And John Lewis noted Trump enemy is all about John Ossoff."
30:37;30:42;"And so there's a lot of national energy and money being focused towards this race,"
30:42;30:43;"which is in April sometime."
30:43;30:44;"It's coming up."
30:44;30:50;"Right, and this is the exact stuff that right when Trump was elected,"
30:50;30:55;"the things that we told ourselves is like, okay, this is really bad."
30:55;30:57;"However, there's midterm elections."
30:57;31:00;"There's going to be opportunities for the Democrats."
31:00;31:04;"They can't take back the White House anytime soon short of impeachment."
31:04;31:05;"Crazy, yeah."
31:05;31:09;"Or something crazy, but there are ways in which we can do this on a local level."
31:09;31:15;"And so this right here is a sterling example, a special election where the Democrats"
31:15;31:17;"could win one more seat in the House."
31:17;31:19;"So John Ossoff is a 30-year-old man."
31:19;31:20;"What else do you know about him?"
31:20;31:21;"Not a whole lot."
31:21;31:22;"He's from that region."
31:22;31:24;"He sends a few too many emails."
31:24;31:27;"Yeah, so yeah, I watch some YouTubes of him."
31:27;31:29;"And I just like, you know, I'm on these mailing lists."
31:29;31:31;"So I became aware of him a while ago."
31:31;31:36;"So then I was like, yeah, there's a lot of national momentum and energy on this race."
31:36;31:40;"And people are like, if he can win this seat in Georgia, that's a good sign."
31:40;31:41;"That's momentum."
31:41;31:44;"That's like a good harbinger of things for 2018."
31:44;31:50;"So anyway, I'm giving him $5 a week until the election, which is in April or May or something."
31:50;31:57;"So yeah, it's a pretty small, in terms of like energy and money, a pretty small drop in the bucket for me."
31:57;32:01;"But I just, you know, anyway, so I get four emails a day from him about it."
32:01;32:03;"I'm looking at a picture of John Ossoff."
32:03;32:04;"He's a good-looking guy."
32:04;32:05;"Yeah."
32:05;32:06;"And he has a beard."
32:06;32:11;"He kind of looks like a barista, but at like a nice place."
32:11;32:15;"And there's a ton of money coming in from the RNC running ads about him."
32:15;32:19;"And they found some like goofy videos of him from when he was in college."
32:19;32:20;"What was he doing, rapping?"
32:20;32:22;"No, he was like in like a acapella group."
32:22;32:24;"And they were like, oh, dude, you know what they were doing?"
32:24;32:26;"They were doing Billy Joel, Uptown Girl."
32:26;32:28;"And what's the problem with that?"
32:28;32:29;"I don't know, it's a great song."
32:29;32:31;"It's like, what's the--"
32:31;32:33;"Now the Republicans got a problem with Billy Joel?"
32:33;32:34;"Yeah, it's insane."
32:34;32:37;"They don't like the class anger of Uptown Girl."
32:37;32:38;"That's true."
32:38;32:41;"The Republicans, they don't want--"
32:41;32:42;"They don't want to talk about class."
32:42;32:46;"They don't want downtown guys and Uptown Girls getting together."
32:46;32:50;"They want that downtown guy to die because he doesn't have health care."
32:50;32:53;"They don't want Billy Joel to marry Christie Brinkley."
32:53;32:57;"I think it's exciting, like a really young man, 30-year-old guy running for Congress."
32:57;32:58;"I think that's cool."
32:58;33:00;"That's great."
33:00;33:01;"We should have him call in."
33:01;33:03;"Let's try to get him for the next show."
33:03;33:04;"Check him out."
33:04;33:06;"One more Democrat down in Georgia?"
33:06;33:07;"Yep."
33:07;33:08;"Come on."
33:08;33:09;"It's a no-brainer."
33:09;33:12;"Okay, so far we know at the very least he was in an acapella group."
33:12;33:14;"We haven't found out anything bad about him."
33:14;33:15;"And they sang Uptown Girl."
33:15;33:17;"I mean, come on, it's pretty good, right?"
33:17;33:20;"John, this one's for you and your golden pipes, bro."
33:27;33:33;"Uptown girl, she's been living in her uptown world"
33:33;33:37;"I bet she never had a backstreet guy"
33:37;33:40;"I bet her mama never told her why"
33:40;33:44;"I'm gonna try for an uptown girl"
33:44;33:48;"She's been living in her white bread world"
33:48;33:52;"As long as anyone with hot dog can"
33:52;33:55;"And now she's looking for a downtown man"
33:55;33:57;"That's what I am"
33:57;34:01;"And when she knows what she wants"
34:01;34:05;"From her time"
34:05;34:12;"And when she wakes up and makes up her mind"
34:12;34:15;"She'll see I'm not so tough"
34:15;34:21;"Just because I'm in love with an uptown girl"
34:21;34:25;"You know I see her in her uptown world"
34:25;34:29;"She's getting tired of her high class toys"
34:29;34:32;"And all the presents from her uptown boys"
34:32;34:36;"She's got a choice"
34:36;34:39;"Alright, so you ready for our second call of the day?"
34:39;34:40;"Yep."
34:40;34:42;"Now this one we're going over to the lighter side."
34:42;34:45;"We looked at some of the darkness in the world"
34:45;34:49;"and now we're gonna remember the reason why we care"
34:49;34:51;"is because there is beauty in this world."
34:51;34:53;"The reason why we want the world to continue"
34:53;34:55;"and people to live in freedom"
34:55;34:57;"is so they can enjoy the beauty of the world."
34:57;35:01;"And what's often referred to as one of the most beautiful pieces of art"
35:01;35:04;"is not Seinfeld the series."
35:04;35:05;"That's..."
35:05;35:06;"Middling."
35:07;35:09;"But the Seinfeld theme song."
35:09;35:11;"Jake's doing some air bass already."
35:11;35:13;"Bum bum bum bum."
35:13;35:15;"I want something to cue it in. I want to hear it."
35:15;35:16;"Can we listen to it before we..."
35:16;35:17;"Yeah, let's listen to it"
35:17;35:19;"Let's listen to the man who composed this."
35:19;35:23;"Oh, I forgot about those horns."
35:23;35:26;"Well, because you know, they have to have little bumpers"
35:26;35:27;"for like different moments in the show."
35:27;35:31;"I thought it was just, in my memory, it was just pure unaccompanied bass."
35:31;35:33;"This is like full."
35:33;35:40;"Well, there's so many versions."
35:40;35:42;"Oh my god, I love it."
35:42;35:44;"That's probably what you're thinking of."
35:44;35:45;"I love it."
35:45;35:52;"We have to ask this guy if he played the bass."
35:52;35:55;"If it's him playing, it must be, right?"
35:55;35:58;"It almost sounds like a synth bass."
35:58;36:00;"Yeah, maybe you're right."
36:00;36:08;"That sounds synthy."
36:08;36:09;"And you hear that..."
36:09;36:12;"Well, anyways, we're going to talk to this guy, Jonathan Wolfe."
36:12;36:14;"Well, it's '89. Is that when the show started?"
36:14;36:16;"Yeah, the show... people, you know, Sinful's such a 90s show,"
36:16;36:18;"people forget that it started in 1989."
36:18;36:21;"So that's, yeah, if it was like a synth slap bass,"
36:21;36:23;"that seems perfect for '89."
36:23;36:25;"Yeah, we'll find out."
36:25;36:27;"There's definitely some programming happening."
36:27;36:30;"All right, so let's get on the phone with Jonathan Wolfe."
36:30;36:34;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
36:34;36:38;"Jonathan, what's up, man?"
36:38;36:40;"Ezra, what an honor."
36:40;36:42;"I'm so pleased to hear from you."
36:42;36:45;"Likewise. You're also on with my co-host, Jake,"
36:45;36:46;"and we're very psyched to have you on the show."
36:46;36:47;"Hey, what's up?"
36:47;36:51;"I'm happy to be here. Thanks for bringing me up."
36:51;36:53;"So, Jonathan, we talk about Seinfeld all the time on this show,"
36:53;36:55;"so it's really incredible to have you on."
36:55;36:57;"We were just listening to the theme song."
36:57;37:01;"So this was 1989 when you get the call to compose this theme?"
37:01;37:02;"Yeah."
37:02;37:03;"What were you doing then?"
37:03;37:05;"Were you already kind of in the TV composing game?"
37:05;37:07;"What was your background?"
37:07;37:09;"Yeah, I was already doing a few series."
37:09;37:12;"I was already had Who's the Boss?"
37:12;37:15;"and Married with Children and a bunch of other shows."
37:15;37:19;"But I got this phone call from Jerry Seinfeld."
37:19;37:21;"Had you ever heard of him at that point?"
37:21;37:23;"No, no one had ever heard of him."
37:23;37:29;"He had one HBO special, and this was his big shot at doing TV."
37:29;37:34;"And he described to me a sound design issue."
37:34;37:37;"It was not really a music issue so much."
37:37;37:42;"He wanted his opening credits to be Jerry Seinfeld standing in front of a group of people."
37:42;37:44;"He tells jokes, they laugh."
37:44;37:47;"And he wanted theme music to go with it."
37:47;37:54;"Now, you're too young to remember this, but in the '80s, theme music was melodic."
37:54;38:00;"We did a lot of sassy saxophones and silly lyrics, and I'm guilty of all that."
38:00;38:02;"But it was not going to work here."
38:02;38:08;"To use those would have been a recipe for an audio conflict with his voice."
38:08;38:11;"So I pitched him, ""Hey, Jerry, how about this?"
38:11;38:14;"Your human voice is the one we need to hear."
38:14;38:18;"How about that's the melody of the Seinfeld theme?"
38:18;38:23;"Every monologue you do will be a variation on the theme,"
38:23;38:27;"and my job will be to accompany you in a way that is--"
38:27;38:30;"the elements will be thematic."
38:30;38:35;"The organic nature of your human voice, talking and telling jokes and people laughing,"
38:35;38:42;"might go well with the organic nature of my human lips and tongue, finger snaps, like this."
38:42;38:46;"[claps and beatboxes]"
38:46;38:49;"And I had his attention."
38:49;38:54;"- So he comes at you with already a very forward-thinking, out-of-the-box idea."
38:54;38:57;"He's like, ""It's already 1989. It's almost the '90s."
38:57;39:01;"No more of the schmaltzy-- - Alan Thicke."
39:01;39:03;"- Alan Thicke stuff."
39:03;39:08;"- Yeah, this is not going to be pretty pictures of his cast over a silly thing."
39:08;39:12;"No, it's him doing-- and that whole notion of getting away from the show"
39:12;39:16;"and presenting, in his case, comedy material,"
39:16;39:21;"aside from the plot of the show, was kind of groundbreaking in itself."
39:21;39:25;"- Right. So he's basically saying to you, ""I need instrumental music,"
39:25;39:28;"""that's still going to feel kind of thematic and fit with 'Go Under My Stand-Up.'"""
39:28;39:32;"- Yeah. - So you get the idea that you want to do something kind of a cappella,"
39:32;39:36;"essentially, using the sounds that you can make with your own voice."
39:36;39:39;"Were you influenced by Bobby McFerrin? Where does this idea come from?"
39:39;39:43;"- Everybody's influenced by Bobby McFerrin, even if they don't know it."
39:43;39:47;"- Sure words. - But mostly, I just wanted to get his attention,"
39:47;39:50;"because when you're doing a pitch, that's the most important thing,"
39:50;39:52;"is that they're not looking around."
39:52;39:56;"So I got his attention with that and said, ""Come on over, Jerry."
39:56;39:58;"""Let's see what you got."""
39:58;40:02;"So he came over and showed me his HBO special,"
40:02;40:05;"and I watched it and noticed that his delivery,"
40:05;40:08;"the way his voice goes up and down and his motion,"
40:08;40:11;"he kind of put a clock on it."
40:11;40:13;"[clicks tongue] About 110."
40:13;40:15;"And so-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on."
40:15;40:19;"Hold on. So you're watching Jerry Seinfeld do stand-up,"
40:19;40:22;"and your musical mind, the gears are turning, and you're like,"
40:22;40:25;"""This guy tells jokes at 110 beats per minute."""
40:25;40:29;"- Well, it's kind of reverse engineering the music for his choreography."
40:29;40:33;"- Right, but you felt a natural musicality and rhythm in his stand-up."
40:33;40:37;"- Yeah, he kind of moves, and he gives visual cues."
40:37;40:39;"He moves with his elbows and his fingers."
40:39;40:42;"He does--if you watch him, he does--"
40:42;40:47;"it's not obvious, not like Michael Richards' kind of physical comedy,"
40:47;40:50;"but he does move with his jokes."
40:50;40:53;"And I put a clock on it, and that's where I clocked it."
40:53;40:55;"I said, ""Well, let's try this and see how it works."""
40:55;40:58;"And it seemed to have a nice groove to go with him."
40:58;41:03;"The bass that people know that I added after that,"
41:03;41:06;"you know, 'cause you gotta have some kind of musical element."
41:06;41:12;"At the time, slap bass had not yet enjoyed celebrity status"
41:12;41:14;"as a solo instrument."
41:14;41:17;"At the time, it was, you know, an element in funk music."
41:17;41:20;"- Jocko? - What's that?"
41:20;41:24;"- How about Jocko? - Jocko was not really doing--"
41:24;41:28;"yeah, again, just like McFerrin, everybody loved Jocko."
41:28;41:33;"But that was not really his signature, the slap bass, right up front,"
41:33;41:35;"at least not that I'm aware of."
41:35;41:37;"- Right, he was more that smooth, fretless--"
41:37;41:39;"- Okay. - ♪ Mm, mm, mm ♪"
41:39;41:42;"- Correct. He was a fretless monster."
41:42;41:44;"- Was that a real bass on the Seinfeld?"
41:44;41:47;"- Well, it was when I sampled it."
41:47;41:49;"- Okay, break that down for us."
41:49;41:53;"- To create a sonic brand,"
41:53;41:56;"something that's a new species of music,"
41:56;41:59;"as you know, sometimes you gotta break a few rules."
41:59;42:02;"You gotta do some audio gene splicing."
42:02;42:08;"At the time, sampling, editing technology was in its infancy."
42:08;42:11;"We had really crude, rudimentary tools."
42:11;42:13;"But I wanted to do it."
42:13;42:16;"So I sampled several of my basses,"
42:16;42:20;"just getting those samples, and then tweaked 'em and played with 'em"
42:20;42:25;"and created this kind of Frankenstein combination of those samples,"
42:25;42:29;"which became the Seinfeld sound."
42:29;42:33;"Loaded 'em all, mapped 'em out onto a keyboard"
42:33;42:35;"so that I could play it superhuman,"
42:35;42:37;"you know, 'cause there's certain things that--"
42:37;42:41;"- So it was real bass sounds, but you were kind of performing it on a MIDI keyboard?"
42:41;42:43;"- Correct, yeah. - Okay."
42:43;42:46;"- Nobody's that superhuman to do the kind of stuff I was doing."
42:46;42:47;"- Wait, wait, I'm sorry."
42:47;42:51;"You're saying that no one could physically play those lines on a bass?"
42:51;42:53;"- Some of 'em. Some of the stuff I was doing."
42:53;42:55;"The bends."
42:55;42:58;"- Well, yeah, some of the sounds-- - I was wondering about the bends."
42:58;43:01;"- I'm sure some, but, you know, Thundercat could play the lines,"
43:01;43:03;"but it's not gonna have that--"
43:03;43:05;"there's certain elements of the sample quality,"
43:05;43:08;"the way things get cut off, that would be impossible for a live bassist."
43:08;43:10;"- Copy that. - Correct."
43:10;43:13;"And things that happen to the tone and the texture"
43:13;43:16;"when you pitch bend and you use the mod wheel"
43:16;43:20;"and things like that that are just not natural sounding."
43:20;43:22;"And I kind of like that."
43:22;43:25;"I did--just to make it pop a little bit more,"
43:25;43:28;"I took a narrow band of--"
43:28;43:29;"I don't even remember what the band was--"
43:29;43:33;"somewhere around 1.5 or 2k, and phase reversed it,"
43:33;43:36;"put it back in, see what it would do."
43:36;43:39;"And what it does is it really jumps out."
43:39;43:42;"- So it's a sampled bass, and all the other elements are snaps,"
43:42;43:45;"and you definitely hear that ""ah"" like a vocal sound."
43:45;43:48;"Everything else is also sampled organic sounds?"
43:48;43:50;"- Yeah, pretty much."
43:50;43:52;"Well, there's those horns, those kind of cheesy late '80s."
43:52;43:54;"- What keyboard was that? You remember?"
43:54;43:57;"- I don't remember. It was all samples."
43:57;43:59;"I was deep into sound."
43:59;44:03;"I can tell you that I was probably serving samples"
44:03;44:05;"off of Sample Cell,"
44:05;44:11;"which was a PCI-based sample server."
44:11;44:13;"- How old were you in 1989?"
44:13;44:16;"I want to paint more of a picture."
44:16;44:18;"- I would have been 31."
44:18;44:21;"- So you're 31, 1989."
44:21;44:22;"- Yeah."
44:22;44:24;"- What kind of music were you into outside of your work?"
44:24;44:26;"Were you listening to, like, hip-hop?"
44:26;44:28;"You have, like, the first ""Dayless Soul"" album?"
44:28;44:31;"- Your sentence does not compute outside of my work."
44:31;44:34;"I was working like a fiend. I was working like crazy."
44:34;44:37;"My regular scheduled work week, Ezra,"
44:37;44:39;"was over 100 hours a week."
44:39;44:40;"- Good lord."
44:40;44:43;"- Just because, you know, I had that fear,"
44:43;44:47;"that rush that all musicians have at some point in their life"
44:47;44:50;"where, man, people are calling me"
44:50;44:52;"and paying me money to create music."
44:52;44:54;"Really? I'm going to take those jobs."
44:54;44:58;"And when you're flavor of the week, a lot of people call."
44:58;45:00;"So I was taking a lot of work."
45:00;45:02;"I was flavor of the week way longer"
45:02;45:04;"than I probably should have been."
45:04;45:06;"But I was taking all those jobs."
45:06;45:09;"So I really didn't have a whole lot of time"
45:09;45:11;"to listen to stuff."
45:11;45:13;"My music editor, a guy named Jack Diamond,"
45:13;45:18;"it was his job to make sure that I heard what was important."
45:18;45:20;"Every new album that came out, he would critique it."
45:20;45:24;"He would pick cuts on it that I had to listen to"
45:24;45:29;"and make sure that I at least was aware of the lexicon."
45:29;45:31;"- So like season two of Seinfeld, he's like,"
45:31;45:33;"""There's a new band called Nirvana."
45:33;45:35;"You got to listen to them."""
45:35;45:37;"- Really? They were new in '91? Really?"
45:37;45:39;"- Well, that's when the big album dropped."
45:39;45:41;"- '91. - In '91."
45:41;45:42;"- '89's funny, though."
45:42;45:45;"Was it like Motley Crue, like Dr. Feelgood record?"
45:45;45:47;"- Yeah. - Throw that on."
45:47;45:49;"- I was into rock, so yeah, those were my bands."
45:49;45:51;"- '89 was a good year. Fine Young Cannibals,"
45:51;45:53;"""She Drives Me Crazy."" That's '89, great song."
45:53;45:57;"- And it was fun. Fine Young Cannibals, fun."
45:57;45:59;"You know, they didn't mind, fun."
45:59;46:01;"They weren't so serious. I love that about them."
46:01;46:02;"- Yeah, they were great."
46:02;46:03;"Well, you know what, Jonathan?"
46:03;46:05;"I don't know if you know, but one member"
46:05;46:09;"of the Time Crisis crew is a legendary Seinfeld fan"
46:09;46:11;"called Seinfeld2000."
46:11;46:13;"I believe you've come across his work."
46:13;46:16;"- I love that occasionally I just drop in"
46:16;46:19;"and leave a little Easter egg, little comments and things."
46:19;46:22;"I love that there's a format for that,"
46:22;46:25;"like Seinfeld2000, for me to reminisce a little bit."
46:25;46:26;"So thank you for that."
46:26;46:29;"- He's keeping the flame alive, but he's here in the studio."
46:29;46:31;"- Jonathan. - And we--"
46:31;46:33;"Okay, he's already on the mic. - How are you?"
46:33;46:35;"- Okay, I was gonna introduce him, but--"
46:35;46:38;"- Jonathan, I'm very excited. Sorry, I just jumped right in."
46:38;46:40;"- Yeah. - Jonathan, sorry."
46:40;46:42;"I usually play the background, but the fact"
46:42;46:45;"that you're on the show, I just had to get on the microphone."
46:45;46:47;"One of the things that I do with the account is"
46:47;46:50;"I like to imagine what Seinfeld would be like today."
46:50;46:51;"Do you ever think about that?"
46:51;46:53;"Like, if the show was still on the air,"
46:53;46:55;"what Jerry and the gang would be up to"
46:55;46:56;"if it was still on television?"
46:56;46:58;"- Oh, God."
46:58;47:01;"I really don't think about those kind of things."
47:01;47:05;"The reality is we lived that experience"
47:05;47:08;"for nine years, and we're deep into--"
47:08;47:10;"and we quit."
47:10;47:12;"We stopped doing it for a reason."
47:12;47:15;"It was time to do it while you're on top,"
47:15;47:16;"before it gets stale."
47:16;47:19;"A lot of shows-- and I've worked on those shows--"
47:19;47:23;"stayed too long at the fair, and they got stale."
47:23;47:27;"The creative juices that folks like you and others"
47:27;47:29;"who put Seinfeld in modern times"
47:29;47:32;"with cell phones and electric cars and stuff--"
47:32;47:34;"- iPads. - They are way more creative"
47:34;47:37;"than we probably would be at this point."
47:37;47:39;"- [chuckles] Wow."
47:39;47:40;"Okay, I accept that."
47:40;47:42;"I guess another question is, you know,"
47:42;47:45;"it seems to me like you were part of the evolution"
47:45;47:48;"of the TV theme, and after Seinfeld,"
47:48;47:50;"things became just a lot shorter,"
47:50;47:52;"the lyrics went away."
47:52;47:54;"I guess what I'm building up to here is that,"
47:54;47:56;"you know, a couple years after Seinfeld comes out,"
47:56;47:59;"a show called ""Friends"" comes on the TV,"
47:59;48:03;"and they've got this damn four-minute-long intro"
48:03;48:06;"with claps and lyrics and stuff,"
48:06;48:08;"and did you guys ever just, you know,"
48:08;48:11;"just watch that intro and just go, ""Oh, God""?"
48:11;48:14;"- I don't know if it was actually four minutes long,"
48:14;48:16;"but okay. - It felt four minutes."
48:16;48:17;"- 240. - Yeah."
48:17;48:18;"- Yeah. - 240."
48:18;48:21;"- Seinfeld kind of juxtaposed itself with ""Friends"""
48:21;48:24;"as the not-Friends show."
48:24;48:26;"You know, Larry had certain rules--"
48:26;48:29;"no learning, no hugging,"
48:29;48:32;"which is the opposite of ""Friends."""
48:32;48:35;"You know, that theme, it splashed hard,"
48:35;48:36;"and it still lives."
48:36;48:38;"People still know it, people still think of it,"
48:38;48:42;"so all I can do is salute that theme"
48:42;48:44;"and, you know, wish them well."
48:44;48:47;"I did plenty of shows like that"
48:47;48:50;"that were kind of generic sitcom."
48:50;48:53;"""Friends,"" however, did it really, really well."
48:53;48:56;"You know, those characters they had,"
48:56;48:58;"you know, I don't really watch TV."
48:58;48:59;"I didn't watch ""Friends"" a lot,"
48:59;49:01;"but I know who the characters are,"
49:01;49:02;"and I recognize those actors"
49:02;49:04;"when I see them from being ""Friends."""
49:04;49:07;"All right, here's a little factoid."
49:07;49:11;"After ""Seinfeld,"" Larry David did a movie."
49:11;49:13;"- ""Sour Grapes."" - It was awful."
49:13;49:15;"""Sour Grapes,"" that's right. You're the one."
49:15;49:16;"[laughs]"
49:16;49:19;"I did the music for it, and there was--"
49:19;49:21;"did you actually see ""Sour Grapes""?"
49:21;49:23;"- I did. I didn't know you did the music for it, though."
49:23;49:24;"That's awesome."
49:24;49:26;"- There was--one of the actors"
49:26;49:31;"was a sitcom actor on a sitcom"
49:31;49:33;"that was lampooning ""Friends."""
49:33;49:34;"Remember that?"
49:34;49:38;"And I wrote-- there was actually an opening credits,"
49:38;49:40;"kind of like that opening credits for ""Friends,"""
49:40;49:44;"so I got to write, you know, a fake ""Friends."""
49:44;49:47;"- Within the Larry David film ""Sour Grapes,"""
49:47;49:48;"there's a ""Friends"" parody."
49:48;49:52;"- Yeah, yeah, and I think-- I think the song was"
49:52;49:54;"""I'll catch you if you fall"""
49:54;49:56;"instead of ""I'll be there for you."""
49:56;50:00;"It was pretty weird, but, you know,"
50:00;50:02;"it was a job, and I did it."
50:02;50:06;"So I guess you just check that out."
50:06;50:09;"The rest of the movie, mm, not so much."
50:09;50:11;"- You know, just one more question, I guess."
50:11;50:13;"You and Jerry ever still chat?"
50:13;50:16;"You guys ever, you know, shoot the shit about music?"
50:16;50:18;"- Ha! - That kind of thing?"
50:18;50:21;"- Not really. He--I'm retired."
50:21;50:25;"I fully retired in 2005, by the way."
50:25;50:27;"- Good for you. - So that's like--"
50:27;50:28;"Yeah, yeah, it was time."
50:28;50:33;"My wife and I decided that our family needed me more"
50:33;50:37;"than Hollywood needed more of my music."
50:37;50:42;"So I retired and became a full-time PTA room parent"
50:42;50:45;"and sports assistant coach and field trip chaperone"
50:45;50:48;"and did that for about ten years."
50:48;50:50;"Now the kids are older now,"
50:50;50:52;"and they don't need me 24/7,"
50:52;50:54;"but for a while I did that."
50:54;50:57;"When I first started on ""Seinfeld,"""
50:57;51:00;"Jerry and I used to hang a little bit."
51:00;51:03;"We were both single. We're both guys about the same age."
51:03;51:06;"And we would hang a little bit, and it was fun, I guess."
51:06;51:08;"- What do you think of the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" music?"
51:08;51:11;"- It's fun. It's good. It stays out of the way."
51:11;51:12;"- Let's keep it real."
51:12;51:15;"Not as forward-thinking as the ""Seinfeld"" theme."
51:15;51:17;"- He didn't, you know--there's no new--"
51:17;51:19;"it's not a new species of music."
51:19;51:21;"He didn't reinvent a wheel."
51:21;51:23;"On its own, it's not really a sonic brand."
51:23;51:28;"It's not an earworm that would instantly identify"
51:28;51:30;"and create a signature for the show."
51:30;51:31;"- Actually, our producer's telling us"
51:31;51:33;"that that's just library music."
51:33;51:35;"- That's probably true."
51:35;51:36;"- Didn't even hire a composer."
51:36;51:38;"- All right, here's a Larry David story."
51:38;51:40;"Ready? I mean, see, I'm retired."
51:40;51:43;"I don't have to flatter anybody, right?"
51:43;51:46;"My last encounter with Larry--"
51:46;51:49;"and I'd worked with him since ""Seinfeld,"""
51:49;51:50;"as you already know--"
51:50;51:55;"I start getting these shot breakdowns and schedules"
51:55;51:56;"and crew lists and things"
51:56;51:59;"for ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" at my office."
51:59;52:00;"And I didn't know anything."
52:00;52:02;"They hadn't--no one had hired me."
52:02;52:04;"Larry hadn't talked to me about it."
52:04;52:05;"I just started getting these materials."
52:05;52:07;"So I just kind of ignored them for a while,"
52:07;52:10;"'cause I'm looking to retire, and it's on cable,"
52:10;52:11;"which I don't really do,"
52:11;52:16;"until I start getting cuts, you know, actual tapes."
52:16;52:19;"Now I've got to do what nobody wants to do."
52:19;52:21;"I had to call Larry David,"
52:21;52:24;"which put yourself--you're putting yourself"
52:24;52:27;"right into that target range."
52:27;52:28;"You're in his scope now,"
52:28;52:30;"because, you know, you're talking to him on the phone,"
52:30;52:34;"and I'd say, ""Hey, Larry, 'Curb' looks great."
52:34;52:35;"You are funny. I'm really proud of you."
52:35;52:38;"Thanks for sharing those materials with me,"
52:38;52:41;"but I got to tell you, I'm retiring."
52:41;52:45;"So let me help you get somebody else to do your music, okay?"""
52:45;52:46;"- Mm-hmm."
52:46;52:48;"- And he says, ""What are you saying, Wolf?"
52:48;52:49;"What do you mean?"""
52:49;52:50;"- Oh, he had no idea."
52:50;52:53;"- He couldn't compute that maybe I'm not doing a show."
52:53;52:57;"So Larry--and by the way, as you know from ""Curb,"""
52:57;53:01;"Larry is lord of the gray area."
53:01;53:02;"If you're not black and white with him,"
53:02;53:05;"he will take advantage of you, and you will lose."
53:05;53:07;"So I said, ""Larry, I'm going to make this"
53:07;53:09;"as clear as possible. I hope this is not offensive,"
53:09;53:14;"but I am not the composer for 'Curb Your Enthusiasm.'"
53:14;53:15;"I will never be the composer for--"
53:15;53:17;"I'm never going to write a single note of music"
53:17;53:18;"for your show."
53:18;53:21;"My name is never going to be in the credits."
53:21;53:24;"Is that clear enough?"""
53:24;53:27;"And he says, ""What are you saying?"
53:27;53:29;"You thought I was going to hire you?"
53:29;53:32;"I wouldn't hire you. You're a hack."""
53:32;53:33;"- Oh."
53:33;53:34;"- Yeah."
53:34;53:37;"- Wait, so why was he sending the tapes to your office?"
53:37;53:40;"- Believe me, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole with him."
53:40;53:42;"I just said, ""I'll send them back."""
53:42;53:46;"But yeah, of course he had assumed that I was going to do it"
53:46;53:48;"when I didn't want to do it."
53:48;53:49;"- Then he turned."
53:49;53:53;"- Which, as you know, he's really quite skilled at."
53:53;53:54;"- Mm."
53:54;53:56;"- If you ever interview him, get ready."
53:56;53:58;"He's going to pick a fight with you."
53:58;54:02;"And you can't win, because guys like you and me,"
54:02;54:03;"we just go through life."
54:03;54:05;"We're not looking for trouble."
54:05;54:10;"He actively seeks it out because he minds it for comedy."
54:10;54:11;"- That's true."
54:11;54:14;"""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is all about Larry getting into trouble."
54:14;54:16;"He is only comfortable when you are not."
54:16;54:18;"- So you were familiar with that."
54:18;54:20;"You were just like, ""All right, man, whatever."""
54:20;54:23;"Or you were like, ""You know what, Larry? Go f--- yourself."""
54:23;54:25;"- No, I didn't. I just did not want to get in."
54:25;54:27;"Because he will win."
54:27;54:30;"If you get into an argument, he will win because he's a pro."
54:30;54:32;"And I am not."
54:32;54:33;"- You know what, Larry, you piece of sh--?"
54:33;54:36;"Why don't you just go dig in the library music"
54:36;54:40;"and use some old polka or klezmer?"
54:40;54:41;"You know what? That's all you deserve."
54:41;54:43;"And he's like, ""I will do that."""
54:43;54:44;"- You know what? Well, if I will do that--"
54:44;54:46;"- I was just grateful--"
54:46;54:50;"I was just grateful that I did not have to recommend a friend"
54:50;54:54;"to work with him because, man, it's hazard pay"
54:54;54:57;"working with Larry because he is just so unpredictable."
54:57;55:03;"Now, he's also, lest the moment goes by, he's genius."
55:03;55:04;"He is-- - Absolutely."
55:04;55:07;"- Probably the best writer I've ever worked with"
55:07;55:09;"because he's Larry David."
55:09;55:11;"So there's that."
55:11;55:13;"- [laughs]"
55:13;55:14;"Understood. Well, that was a great story."
55:14;55:15;"Thank you for sharing it with us."
55:15;55:19;"And so, Jonathan, it's been amazing talking to you."
55:19;55:21;"David, finally, this is a song we've been hearing"
55:21;55:23;"our entire lives, and we got all this new information about it,"
55:23;55:26;"and I know the listeners are gonna love this."
55:26;55:29;"- Well, I'm so glad that you noticed my music."
55:29;55:33;"It makes me feel good that folks of different generations"
55:33;55:38;"enjoy my work, and, man, long may it wave."
55:38;55:40;"- It's gonna live forever."
55:40;55:45;"And if you're ever out there enjoying your retirement"
55:45;55:49;"in Louisville, Kentucky, and a little earworm"
55:49;55:53;"kind of enters your brain, we could always use"
55:53;55:57;"some new interstitial theme music on ""Time Crisis."""
55:57;56:01;"- Ezra, there's a whole bunch of young, hot, smart,"
56:01;56:04;"strong music creators, people like you."
56:04;56:06;"I had my turn."
56:06;56:09;"I was at bat for a long time, and I hit that ball hard"
56:09;56:10;"over and over again."
56:10;56:13;"It's no longer my turn. It's your turn."
56:13;56:15;"All you young folks, I travel around."
56:15;56:18;"I give lectures and concerts at universities now,"
56:18;56:21;"and I meet a lot of really strong music creators."
56:21;56:24;"It's their turn to step up to the plate"
56:24;56:25;"and do some really great music,"
56:25;56:29;"so you're not gonna hear anything else musically from me."
56:29;56:31;"I am fully retired. I wrote enough music."
56:31;56:37;"There were 75 ""Prime Time Network"" series that I did."
56:37;56:40;"- Okay, so that's a maybe?"
56:40;56:42;"[laughter]"
56:42;56:43;"No, okay, I gotta say--"
56:43;56:45;"- You're like Larry David."
56:45;56:46;"- You know what, Jonathan?"
56:46;56:49;"I wouldn't want you composing music for ""Time Crisis."""
56:49;56:51;"I don't need your music."
56:51;56:52;"- I'm a hat."
56:52;56:53;"- I really respect that, Jonathan,"
56:53;56:54;"'cause I always say this."
56:54;56:56;"It's like, you know, in the arts,"
56:56;56:59;"I always respect people who retire,"
56:59;57:01;"not because I think people need to retire,"
57:01;57:03;"but because, you know, there's not a lot of people"
57:03;57:05;"with the kind of generosity of spirit"
57:05;57:07;"like with what you just said."
57:07;57:09;"You know, you look at some of the old rockers."
57:09;57:11;"They're gonna cling to--"
57:11;57:15;"you gotta pry that career out of their cold, dead hands."
57:15;57:18;"The idea that that kind of, you know,"
57:18;57:21;"like, you do your thing, and you go enjoy life"
57:21;57:24;"and let somebody else go put in those crazy 100-hour weeks."
57:24;57:26;"You know, it's like, I really respect that,"
57:26;57:28;"that you--and especially that you're going out"
57:28;57:30;"and encouraging young composers, too,"
57:30;57:32;"'cause you don't see that a lot."
57:32;57:34;"- It's a lesson learned from Seinfeld."
57:34;57:37;"Go out on top, 'cause I was still working when I--"
57:37;57:39;"you know, ""Will & Grace"" was still on the air,"
57:39;57:41;"""Reba"" was still on the air,"
57:41;57:43;"but it was time for me to leave,"
57:43;57:45;"so that was a lesson I learned from Seinfeld."
57:45;57:48;"Know when it's time to quit."
57:48;57:50;"- Well, we appreciate that, Jonathan."
57:50;57:52;"All right, great talking to you, man, and--"
57:52;57:54;"- You too, well, thank--guys,"
57:54;57:56;"thank you so much for reaching out to me."
57:56;57:58;"It is an honor to speak with you."
57:58;58:01;"I can't wait to tell my daughter that--"
58:01;58:03;"you know, who's in college--"
58:03;58:05;"that I talked with Ezra Koenig tonight."

58:07;58:09;"I know that the composing music's out of the question,"
58:09;58:11;"but maybe you'll call in again."
58:11;58:13;"We can talk about ""Who's the Boss,"" ""Reba,"" another one."
58:13;58:16;"'Cause I know you probably get mostly Seinfeld questions."

58:18;58:20;"you mean, at the end of all of it,"
58:20;58:23;"most people want to talk about Seinfeld or ""Will & Grace,"""

01:14:06;01:14:07;"No."
01:14:07;01:14:11;"It's a-- you would show a picture of some grizzled worker's hands"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"to imply that these hands are the hands of the person in the relationship who works"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"so that her hands can look like--"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"I guess this is very heteronormative."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"That's like old school."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Yeah, actually--"
01:14:21;01:14:24;"In reality, you're both working 50 hours a week in an office."
01:14:24;01:14:28;"You both have super soft hands."

01:14:34;01:14:37;"so that hers can look like this, comparably overworked."

01:14:41;01:14:45;"""We make a sacrifice here so that this can be beautiful."""
01:14:45;01:14:46;"Right."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"The hands of the working partner in the relationship--"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"it should be beyond gender, but the hands of the working partner"

01:15:06;01:15:07;"Exactly."

01:16:29;01:16:32;"and then he was like, ""Let's just drop it down even more, guys."""
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Yeah, or maybe he was already in that key and it just worked."
01:16:34;01:16:38;"I mean, I'm sure Chris Martin is such a consummate professional singer-songwriter"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"that I bet he's so intimately familiar with his range."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Right."
01:16:42;01:16:46;"I bet he's probably like, ""I can really now A high B."""
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Yeah."
01:16:47;01:16:51;"""E"" is a good key for me because the fifth in the E is B and I can just kill it."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Right."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"It's crazy."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"Sometimes in the studio working on a song, you move something up a half step."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"It's like night and day."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"I always wonder about that."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Sometimes you look songs up and they're like, ""It's in E flat."""
01:17:01;01:17:02;"Yeah."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"And you're just like, ""Jesus, what?"""
01:17:03;01:17:04;"I've been working on a song in E flat."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"It's such an awkward song to play on the guitar."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"You know what?"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"It's awkward for a guitar."
01:17:08;01:17:14;"E flat's a classic key for piano because some people learn to play on the black keys kind of."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"So Beatles have a lot of songs in A flat and E flat."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"Yeah, or B flat."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"You're just like, ""Really?"""
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I want to just do a better job of that."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"I sing the first verse really low."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"I sing the chorus just like this."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Da-da-da-da-da-da."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Is that one octave you're doing?"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"What is that?"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"I sing the first verse really low."
01:17:35;01:17:39;"I sing the chorus just like-- Yeah, it's over an octave, I think."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Yeah, like an octave and a half?"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"I mean, some people think that's what songwriting is all about, is about intervals."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"What, like jumping intervals, you mean?"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Or the relation--"
01:17:47;01:17:52;"Or like just having it have a big harmonic spectrum."
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Yeah, and these things kind of go in and out of fashion, but for a long time, you know,"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"the idea of a big chorus means that the vocals jump up."
01:17:58;01:18:02;"Do you guys ever love to jump up octaves?"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"One of Chris Martin's predecessors, arguably."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"Bono."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Yeah."
01:18:06;01:18:09;"Bono's also like a classic of just like--"
01:18:09;01:18:12;"With or without you-- Oh, dude, you're tapped in."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Oh, wow, great minds."
01:18:13;01:18:18;"With or without you, I know I can't live."
01:18:18;01:18:21;"With or without you, I can't--"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"I can't-- I can't live."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"I can't live."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"With or without--"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Jump the octave."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Yeah."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Jumping octaves is not easy, though."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"Shout out to these guys."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"These guys have great voices."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"I can't jump the octave in every key."
01:18:37;01:18:41;"Bono's crazy, too, because when he's singing really high, it doesn't even sound that high."
01:18:41;01:18:47;"I remember like in high school being in a car and With or Without You was on, one of those Joshua Tree songs."
01:18:47;01:18:52;"And I tried to like-- I tried to match his note, and I had to do it in falsetto."
01:18:52;01:18:57;"It's like With or Without You, but he's actually singing it like full voice."
01:18:57;01:18:59;"Yeah, he has a beautiful voice."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Yeah."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"At that point, I was like, oh, whoa, I can't sing at all."
01:19:02;01:19:06;"We all have to take the range God gave us and make it as good as possible."
01:19:06;01:19:14;"And maybe you can expand it a little bit, but, you know, Bob Dylan couldn't sing something just like this."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"No."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"Yeah, he made it work."
01:19:16;01:19:20;"I sing the fuzz was really low."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"Joshua Tree was only two years old in '89."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Three."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"'87, bro."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"'86."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Money on this."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"OK, yeah."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Tree came out in '87."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Yeah, all right."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"I think you're right."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"It's in '87."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I wonder if they were still putting out singles like almost into '89."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Big album like that?"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Of course."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"They're still working on it."
01:19:40;01:19:41;"Like One Tree."
01:19:41;01:19:42;"What's that?"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Like Red Dirt Town or Red Dirt--"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"One Tree Hill."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Yeah."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Red Dirt Town."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"Yeah, you're right."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"You're right."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"It was March '87."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"All right, let's go back to 1989."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Ah, this is a classic."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"I was just talking about them."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Remember Milli Vanilli?"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:54;01:20:02;"For our younger listeners, this was the German R&B duo that was kind of put together."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"The guys were chosen for their looks."
01:20:03;01:20:09;"They were not actually the singers on the song, and they would kind of pretend they would"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"lip sync."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Live at their shows."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Live."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"And nobody really cares about lip syncing, but they were lip syncing to other people's"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"voices."
01:20:15;01:20:20;"And this is really crazy is that they won the Grammy for Best New Artist, and it was"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"taken back once they got caught."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Do you think that would happen now?"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"They did not sing at all on the album."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"They could not sing straight up."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"I just don't think anybody would pull that these days."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"Right."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Because also, you don't need to be as good of a singer."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"You could, with auto-tune, even people without great pitch can still express themselves on"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"the mic."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"I remember seeing clips of the recording of that album, and it was like a middle-aged"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"guy singing the parts."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"It was like, ""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:46;01:20:49;"Yeah, and famously, that's the song we're about to listen to, ""Girl, You Know It's True."""
01:20:49;01:20:55;"Is that when they got caught, they were doing a live performance, and the tape started skipping,"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"and it kept skipping on, ""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:57;01:20:58;"""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:59;01:21:02;"And they just kind of looked at each other, and just like, ""Ugh."""
01:21:02;01:21:06;"That is like, can you imagine, it starts the song, but can you imagine the pressure of"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"that?"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"So what are you doing back?"
01:21:08;01:21:12;"Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"Also keep in mind, these guys were German."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"That's weird."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"I really mean that much to you?"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Was it German dudes singing it, or American dudes?"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"That's a good question."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"I mean, sick production."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"This still sounds fresh, actually."
01:21:22;01:21:35;"But can you imagine the pressure those guys must have dealt with every day?"
01:21:35;01:21:40;"No, what's really sad is that they became villainized, and one of the guys ended up"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"dying eight, nine years later."
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Depressed."
01:21:44;01:21:48;"And I think back on drugs, medication, petty crime."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Oh my God, dude."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"Let them live."
01:21:50;01:22:08;"I have this weird memory of playing Little League and being on the mound at baseball"
01:22:08;01:22:14;"practice pitching, and having this song coursing through my head."
01:22:14;01:22:20;"I was basically replaying the song in my mind, in vivid detail."
01:22:20;01:22:25;"And I remember my coach coming out and yelling at me."
01:22:25;01:22:30;"I was listening to the song in my head, and he was yelling at me, and I wasn't listening"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"to him."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"It's a super weird memory."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Drake."

01:23:48;01:23:49;"'89, what a weird period."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"'89, there were cool things happening."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"You know what?"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"People are too hard on lip syncers, man."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"Remember Jessica Simpson?"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"Oh, Ashley Simpson, I'm sorry."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Kind of."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"She sang."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"She was a singer, but on SNL, she was lip syncing to make herself feel more comfortable"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"or something."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"Or maybe her voice wasn't sounding good that day."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"And it kind of really hurt her career, and it was kind of like, ""Oh, I'm going to have"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"to do this."""
01:24:01;01:24:02;"And I was like, ""Oh, I'm going to have to do this."""

01:27:17;01:27:22;"I might not tell the truth, but I won't lie to you. Yeah, I don't think that would fly man"
01:27:22;01:27:29;"I'm gonna try if they had so if there's anybody out there weird if there's anybody out there. Yeah, it's like Andy Warhol style"
01:27:29;01:27:36;"Anybody who wants to be a pop star, but he doesn't write songs doesn't know music and doesn't sing no talent"
01:27:36;01:27:44;"Maybe I think your talent is your it's like reality TV or Instagram your talent is your natural magnetism, right?"
01:27:44;01:27:51;"Natural charisma, I guess what I'm saying is natural magnetism might be more important than than singing voices and writing talent"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"Clearly anyway hit me up if you're interested"
01:27:54;01:28:00;"Back to our time Sam Hunt body like a back road remember this. Oh, yeah body like a back"

01:28:27;01:28:29;"Persistent like"
01:28:29;01:28:33;"Six weeks"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"But I've been working on some stuff in a similar vein"
01:28:36;01:28:42;"Not musically or vibe wise but you know that that feeling that I saw you once"
01:28:42;01:28:45;"This person walking by with braids. I didn't know you"
01:28:45;01:28:49;"And I continued not to know you for six weeks"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"and now"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"Now we go way back. There was a time. We didn't know each other. Yeah, and now we go way back"
01:28:56;01:29:02;"So Cadillac, they were in like the same circles. They were like he was seeing a lot of her over that six-week period"
01:29:02;01:29:07;"It wasn't just like I saw this girl at the coffee shop. I've been obsessed with there and then six weeks later"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"I saw her again. I feel like he's saying like"

01:29:21;01:29:23;"being like"
01:29:23;01:29:29;"My nice a-ha when can I get your number? And that's a funny day and she's and she's just like it's a little bit"
01:29:29;01:29:36;"Harassment you gotta like you just let you're like a super cute girl working at a coffee shop and you just have like"
01:29:36;01:29:39;"15 guys a day coming in. Oh, they're like"

01:29:44;01:29:46;"It's like brutal like standing you're standing in line"
01:29:46;01:29:50;"And the guy's like trying to get his 45 seconds of face time to flirt with her"
01:29:50;01:29:54;"To try to like move the ball. Oh, God, is that what this song is about?"
01:29:54;01:30:01;"It's like she worked down at the Starbucks. Yeah, just like every morning the job"
01:30:01;01:30:06;"I'm away to Home Depot"
01:30:06;01:30:13;"You know, it's also so brutal about that. It's like I'm also just picturing it just like rush hour just like yeah"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"You know, you know good Starbucks and there's like slammed"
01:30:16;01:30:21;"You know, it doesn't take much to make a Starbucks feel full just like 11 people in line. Oh my god"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"It's just like 11 people in line. Just waiting like"
01:30:25;01:30:31;"Just doing all the people being like it's not what I want the next guest and then just like some dude just kind of lingering"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"By the place where they put the drinks out just being like"
01:30:33;01:30:42;"So anyway, how was your weekend? Yeah, um, it was pretty good Frank. Can I get that macchiato? Oh, yeah"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"Oh, that's cool. You do anything special? Um"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"I"
01:30:46;01:30:51;"Think what kind of maniac would we just monopolize somebody's time like that? I just remembered"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"I actually asked a girl out that worked at a coffee shop. Oh god"
01:30:55;01:30:58;"You're no better than Sam. No, but here's how I did it"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"It was it was a block from my place. No, but here's the thing"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"I wouldn't do I was so self-conscious of this concept and I would not linger"
01:31:04;01:31:10;"But like I was in there enough so we knew each other's names and then I called her at the coffee shop"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"I called her at home. I don't know how I had her number"
01:31:12;01:31:16;"Well, that's a pretty important part of the story is how you got her number. How the hell did I have her number? I"
01:31:16;01:31:19;"Don't remember that incidental"
01:31:19;01:31:26;"This is pre cell phones. Yeah, let's straight-up landline cold call and did you go out on a date?"
01:31:26;01:31:31;"No, she just shut you down. I think she had a boyfriend. Oh, did you have to stop going to that coffee shop?"
01:31:31;01:31:34;"I think I took a breather right a solid"
01:31:34;01:31:39;"Like 60 day breather on it. It was fine. It was not like a big deal"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"Okay, I mean is there a way this is the same hunt song"
01:31:44;01:31:52;"Marriages that are started in a coffee shop. Do you meet people in unexpected ways? And it's it's a little awkward"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"I mean, you know, yeah, it's"
01:31:54;01:31:58;"It's a tough one cuz you got these like scumbag pickup artist types for the record"
01:31:58;01:32:04;"I do not feel at all bad about asking that girl out and she seemed kind of I remember like my memories"
01:32:04;01:32:08;"I was like 22. Maybe she was like 27. I think she was sort of like, oh, that's cute"
01:32:09;01:32:16;"She wasn't weirded out it's maybe no different than any other situation where you ask somebody out, okay"
01:32:16;01:32:21;"I remember now I did a exhibition at the coffee shop. I hung my art in the coffee shop for a month"
01:32:21;01:32:29;"That's why I had her number and then I called her and I was like, hey, I'm gonna go see this this art exhibition downtown"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"In a few days. Do you want to roll?"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"chill"
01:32:35;01:32:39;"That's okay. That seems appropriate. You guys already established a relation. She was like"
01:32:39;01:32:44;"Organizing the art shows at the coffee shop. So I like that's why I had her anyway, blah blah blah"
01:32:44;01:32:48;"All right. Well, all I can say is Sam hunt. I"
01:32:48;01:32:55;"Guess I'm on it worked out body like a back road. Let's go back to 1989 bangles eternal flame"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"That's a that's a good one great one"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"89 is kind of poppin"
01:33:06;01:33:23;"This feels like I could have been written by like the Bee Gees, oh, yeah, this could be like or like"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"1964 right"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"But the bangles were kind of throwback"
01:33:28;01:33:32;"Did they write this yeah"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"I"
01:33:34;01:33:39;"Watch you when you"
01:33:39;01:33:44;"What was their story I don't know anything about that"
01:33:44;01:33:54;"Well, listen to this yeah, this song was written by Susanna who's the singer of the bangles"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"And then they go to this part like"
01:34:01;01:34:07;"It's like weird 60s weird that this is only 20 years after"
01:34:07;01:34:13;"Like 1969 I'm just tripping out on that. Yeah, it's uh"
01:34:13;01:34:20;"Like the music from the 60s from our top five of 68, you know from last year. It was like"
01:34:20;01:34:27;"So relatively recent so this song was written by Susanna Hoff's who was the singer of the bangles?"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"but also with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg and"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"I"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Guess Susanna was telling"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Billy Steinberg"
01:34:35;01:34:39;"about going to Graceland and seeing some eternal flame that they have there for Elvis and"
01:34:39;01:34:43;"As soon as Billy Steinberg heard the words eternal flame"
01:34:43;01:34:48;"He immediately thought of the synagogue in the town of Palm Springs, California where he grew up. I"
01:34:48;01:34:52;"Remember during our Sunday school class, they would walk us through the sanctuary"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"There's one little red light and they told us it was called"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"the eternal flame"
01:35:24;01:35:30;"Okay, so she's saying am I dreaming this love or is it my delusional or is this the real deal"
01:35:30;01:35:38;"That's a real question that's a question that every guy at the coffee shop has to ask himself before he has the barista"
01:35:38;01:35:45;"Cuz 99% of you guys and the birds that are dreaming are delusional absolutely in the breeze"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"I can see it coming from a mile away"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"Yeah, like the guy can already like that kind of fake smile"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Oh"
01:35:52;01:36:01;"Do you feel the same no am I only"
01:36:01;01:36:06;"Dreaming yes, is this burning?"
01:36:06;01:36:09;"Nope"

01:36:47;01:36:53;"Wildly out of step with the feel of early 2017, right? This is good times"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I'm in Miami"
01:36:55;01:37:02;"Wake up with no jamming. So that's ever dinner Julio sir. That's Debbie. All right, Julio"

01:37:55;01:37:58;"Empty is all get out but good"
01:37:59;01:38:03;"Yeah, which is not to say that he's empty as a performer, you know any any song that's only"
01:38:03;01:38:07;"about"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Being rich"
01:38:09;01:38:15;"Right is empty. What's like the deepest song about being like rich and just like living the good life"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"the deepest like the one that like"
01:38:18;01:38:25;"Resonates emotionally the most well, you know like some people tough, you know, like notorious BIG"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"the the rich talk was always undercut with"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"You know like the classic line"
01:38:31;01:38:36;"Super Nintendo Sega Genesis when I was dead broke man. I couldn't picture this right, right"
01:38:36;01:38:41;"Okay, or that or the ice cube song which one today was a good day today was a good day"
01:38:41;01:38:46;"It's not about being rich. That's about oh, yeah, you're right because in that he's not rich ice cube"
01:38:46;01:38:49;"He's still living at his mom's right cook breakfast"
01:38:49;01:38:55;"With no hog. In fact that that song is actually like dark in a way because it's like yes"
01:38:55;01:39:00;"He's not saying man. Today was a good day because I got a condo in Miami and I woke up with no jam"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"He's not saying that he's saying today was a good day"
01:39:02;01:39:05;"Because I didn't have to use my right nobody died today"
01:39:05;01:39:08;"That's actually an incredibly"
01:39:08;01:39:14;"That's talking about how good just a normal day. He played his mom made a good breakfast"
01:39:14;01:39:23;"He played basketball with his friends. He got a beep from Kim. She can all night. He went to the fatburger at 2 a.m"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"Wait, is that in the song? Yeah"
01:39:26;01:39:30;"So I'm saying like that's about that's basically being like it's crazy"
01:39:30;01:39:33;"You know what he's talking about in that song to Bruno Mars"
01:39:33;01:39:33;"Yeah"
01:39:33;01:39:39;"Like he's literally just talking about being in the neighborhood he grew up in wake up your mom's house play basketball with your friends"
01:39:39;01:39:42;"And have sex with somebody who loves to have sex"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"That's a good day"
01:39:44;01:39:52;"And then go to fatburger after the sex Bruno Mars would be like, oh you oh you had you played basketball had sex"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"Well, I played basketball whatever on the top of a condo in Miami"
01:39:55;01:40:01;"yeah, and then I went on a PJ and I had sex on the PJ with three women and"
01:40:01;01:40:09;"Then I had steak and today wasn't even that good and today wasn't even that good. That's the sentiment and hey, that's his experience"
01:40:09;01:40:14;"His journey, it's cool that the cube song. I haven't heard it in years and in my mind"
01:40:14;01:40:20;"It was like that like the emotional vibe of that song is like the Bruno song"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"Even though the lyrical content is nowhere near it"
01:40:23;01:40:30;"No, well, I'm memory of that song is like it's just kind of eerie like the you know, think about a sample"
01:40:30;01:40:39;"What year was it like 93 or something early yeah early 90s. Yeah, like listen to"
01:40:39;01:40:48;"This song always made me feel like yeah"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"It's like a weird eerie dream"
01:40:51;01:40:58;"It's like it's not just the tone of even just instrumental. It's like like washy. It's not happy. Yeah, it's kind of chill wave"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"It's not happy or sad"
01:41:00;01:41:10;"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God I don't know but today seems kind of I know"
01:41:10;01:41:14;"Walking from the door. No small and mama cook the breakfast with no"

01:41:19;01:41:26;"I wanna dig out hooked it up for later as I hit the dope thinking will I live another 24?"
01:41:26;01:41:32;"I gotta go cuz I got me a drop top and if I hit the switch I can make the ass"
01:41:32;01:41:38;"Had to stop at a red light looking in my mirror not a checker inside"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Okay, so back to"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"Wily sidetrack the number one. Well, no, but it's cool. Yeah"
01:41:44;01:41:47;"You know happiness is all about context"
01:41:47;01:41:52;"Yeah, if you're Bruno Mars, you got all these houses and stuff. It's not gonna be a good day for you"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"Unless you get yet another house"
01:41:54;01:42:02;"Whereas if you insatiable appetites brutal if you don't even have a real estate portfolio, you're gonna appreciate the small things"
01:42:02;01:42:05;"Like getting a beep from camera or whatever"
01:42:05;01:42:11;"The number one song this week in 1989. Oh, this is one of your favorites. Wait, did we okay? We're 89"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"Yeah, back to 89 the number one song"
01:42:13;01:42:16;"Actually, you're the one introduced me to the song"
01:42:16;01:42:27;"I'm sort of placing it I introduced it this song. Yeah"
01:42:27;01:42:37;"Oh living years, that's right"
01:42:37;01:42:40;"Mike and the mechanics the living years"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"All this one's deep. What's this song's about his dad? Yeah"
01:42:44;01:42:49;"This is some tearjerker"
01:42:49;01:42:54;"That's true"
01:42:54;01:43:00;"Baby boomers are doing a great job at running stuff right now"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"Yeah"
01:43:02;01:43:22;"Oh"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"All right, so summarize the song heavy dude"
01:43:24;01:43:28;"Well, his dad's dead right and he's looking back with regret"
01:43:29;01:43:33;"Saying I know things I didn't tell you and also saying I know we had intergenerational beef"
01:43:33;01:43:39;"We had straight-up strife and I bet Mike him the canks guy was like a got like a dude of the 60s"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Yeah, he was in Genesis. Oh"
01:43:41;01:43:46;"Mike was in Genesis before so yeah, his dad's like a old English guy, right?"
01:43:46;01:43:53;"And he's like he's running around Peter Gabriel dad's probably like a World War two guy and then he is this like snotty"
01:43:53;01:43:59;"Rockstar son, I mean rockstar just like yeah, he's like journeyman musician son"
01:43:59;01:44:03;"Who's growing his hair out? He's just like dad dad come see my progressive rock band"
01:44:03;01:44:11;"He goes sees Peter Gabriel wearing like a costume and his dad's just like get a real job, but dad it's in 7/16 time"
01:44:11;01:44:20;"Don't get a song a song shouldn't be nine minutes and then his dad drops dead in like 1982 or something"
01:44:20;01:44:23;"hmm"
01:44:23;01:44:26;"It's pretty like Springsteen II keep going though"
01:44:26;01:44:43;"Stilted conversation"
01:44:43;01:44:52;"You say you just don't see it he says it's perfect sense"
01:44:53;01:44:56;"You just can't get agreement in this"
01:44:57;01:44:59;"Oh"
01:45:05;01:45:12;", oh"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Oh"
01:45:14;01:45:40;"We"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"I"
01:45:42;01:45:53;"Man it'd be tough like my parents and I see more of us eye to eye"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"Like for instance like with the last election like if my parents were Trump supporters"
01:45:57;01:46:03;"That would be tough man. That would be like a and I need friends that you know are in that situation"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"It'd be a real"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"Weird man, and he said stilted conversation"
01:46:09;01:46:13;"That's heavy obviously you gotta if your parents are"
01:46:13;01:46:17;"Making political decisions that ruin other people's lives"
01:46:17;01:46:22;"You can't take their side you have to limit your sympathy, but at the same time"
01:46:22;01:46:27;"Generally speaking we consider family a permanent bond that you have to work through"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"absolutely, I"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"mean a lot of people would say you don't have to"
01:46:32;01:46:36;"You shouldn't give too much ground to Trump supporters"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Well you don't have to give them any ground"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"Politically, I don't know man. That's a tough one"
01:46:42;01:46:49;"Let's just look at the course for a second say it loud say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear"
01:46:49;01:46:53;"Yeah, it's too late when we die oh"
01:46:53;01:46:58;"The high is such a heavy. I know right to admit. We don't see eye to eye"
01:46:58;01:47:01;"You know it's brutal"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"It's so much of life is just acceptance"
01:47:04;01:47:08;"You know like there's this has been a very tough thing for me to learn in life"
01:47:08;01:47:13;"Thank you. This is tough. This is classic this stuff for everybody to learn that there's not always"
01:47:13;01:47:16;"There's not always resolution in life"
01:47:16;01:47:20;"And you want to believe that there's a resolution in life, and I can understand"
01:47:20;01:47:23;"It's better if you're somebody like very different beliefs than your parents"
01:47:23;01:47:28;"Or like this guy's dad at World War two and he's just like they just don't get each other you want to believe"
01:47:29;01:47:35;"That if you'd done something differently if you listened to more or something that there could have been a resolution"
01:47:35;01:47:38;"But what's an even more bitter pill to swallow is sometimes. It's not"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Not on the cards"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"It's not always in the cards"
01:47:42;01:47:45;"And yeah, you know this life sometimes. You're just left being like"
01:47:45;01:47:53;"Should I have done something that stuff? I mean, maybe that's the difference between him and Bruce Springsteen"
01:47:53;01:47:57;"because this song is like a little sentimental and a little maudlin and"
01:47:58;01:48:01;"Schmaltzy right because it's like you don't the message"
01:48:01;01:48:05;"He's putting forth like you don't really buy like you can listen as well as you hear"
01:48:05;01:48:09;"And it's like well, it doesn't work out that way, and I feel like Bruce's song would have been like"
01:48:09;01:48:15;"Acknowledging the divide with his father well yeah, and not and not"
01:48:15;01:48:23;"Trying to like sugarcoat it with like like this is brutal. Yeah, this pain will haunt me this pain will haunt"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"Yeah, that's the Bruce right"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"later Mike"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"well and the mechanics"
01:48:29;01:48:33;"Says I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away"
01:48:33;01:48:38;"I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say that's brutal like you ever heard a story like that somebody"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"Wasn't there when it when a loved one passed and wish they were there"
01:48:41;01:48:47;"But the tough part is is that and maybe you would feel better if you got to say everything you wanted to say I?"
01:48:47;01:48:53;"Certainly believe that sure but the the tough part is even if you get to say all the things you want to say to a person"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"It doesn't necessarily mean that resolution"
01:48:56;01:49:01;"You're gonna get resolution. Yeah, or that's gonna resonate with I know that it's bringing it for them"
01:49:01;01:49:07;"Are you like yeah that may be way more Bruce to be like you know I and look this is guys lived experience"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"So I'm not trying to take away from it"
01:49:09;01:49:13;"But it just in terms of what it makes me think about it would be more spring steen Ian to be like I"
01:49:13;01:49:17;"Went back one last day. I said all the things I had to say"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"He just shook his head, and I just walked away"
01:49:20;01:49:24;"You know that feeling I'd be ambiguous"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Yeah, and it'd be like I"
01:49:27;01:49:32;"Did I said cuz sometimes that that's a really brutal song this song is almost like I missed my chance to do what I should"
01:49:32;01:49:37;"Have done and that's haunting in its own way, but also to be like I did everything I could and I was still left with"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"a lack of resolution"
01:49:39;01:49:46;"That's such a yeah awful part of life like the tone of this song is almost suggesting that he thinks he would have had rest"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"It's like a naive"
01:49:47;01:49:50;"Hope and belief that he would have had the sense of resolution"
01:49:50;01:49:56;"Which I don't think he would have no doesn't the song end with like it's all good because it's the cycle of life"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"And I have a yeah, he says I think I caught his spirit later that same year"
01:49:58;01:50:01;"I'm sure I heard his echo in my newborn in my baby's newborn tears"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"I just wish I could have told him in the living years"
01:50:04;01:50:09;"Brute that's terrible. That's awful lyric writing. I mean I get it well. He's feeling it. No, but you know"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"You know you know that's a human listen to that"
01:50:11;01:50:14;"I don't think you like cats cradle the cats in the cradle that song"
01:50:14;01:50:20;"But that song is about this guy the singer that song had conflict with his dad right and then later"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"then to that song is like and now I have a son and"
01:50:22;01:50:30;"I have conflict with my son to the circle game, so that you know the circle of life went. There's the positive spin is like"
01:50:30;01:50:36;"People die, but new people come into the world and there's always a chance to redemption and hope whatever"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"but then the negative side is kind of like"
01:50:38;01:50:42;"Another way to look at it was like this guy had conflict with his father later that same year"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"he had a baby, and he realized that like"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"Human life is suffering and it's hard to connect or something"
01:50:51;01:50:54;"Bruce just would have never brought up his newborn babies tear"
01:50:54;01:51:01;"He wouldn't have there's no way it's too much yeah, he might talk about his baby"
01:51:01;01:51:06;"As I hold my baby son in my arms"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"late"
01:51:08;01:51:14;"I know there's nothing I could do the factory was closing down and"
01:51:14;01:51:17;"- I"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"said"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"You're born alone, and you die alone"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"man"
01:51:25;01:51:30;"Hold my son. I pray to God his life won't be marked by these fears"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Cuz there's nothing you can do"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"the hopes and dreams"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Yeah"
01:51:37;01:51:42;"Cuz I know he won't find happiness in the living years"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"when death's embrace"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"Takes my sweet son. I don't know"
01:51:49;01:51:54;"But whatever I still I still like this song and this is his experience and oh"
01:51:54;01:51:58;"God, that's a great. I'm into the song. It's a great song"
01:51:58;01:52:05;"Yeah, it's a little over the line, but it's I mean that was the number one song in 1989 the number one song in"
01:52:05;01:52:12;"2017 is not so concerned with that type of stuff. It's a little more concerned with matters of the flesh"
01:52:12;01:52:15;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"not as existential"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"I"
01:52:20;01:52:37;"Like to imagine this song is called bedsheets right Ed Sheeran is Mike in the mechanics baby son grown-up. Oh my god"
01:52:37;01:52:42;"1989 he was held in his father Mike in the mechanics arms"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"Was Ed Sheeran born 89"
01:52:45;01:52:50;"We held that would make you like 28 wouldn't it he's probably a little younger"
01:52:50;01:53:08;"Yeah, it's big I mean that's the circle of life"
01:53:08;01:53:13;"It's like this pain that other people experienced in the past and then 28 years later"
01:53:13;01:53:18;"You're taking girls to a Chinese buffet and making out in the backseat of the cab"
01:53:18;01:53:24;"These are all parts of life. I don't mean to imply that Mike in the mechanics"
01:53:24;01:53:28;"Are better than Ed Sheeran because their number one song"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"had more"
01:53:30;01:53:36;"Gravitas cuz the truth is as much as life is about haunting memories and death and the circle of life"
01:53:37;01:53:40;"Life is equally about Chinese buffets making small talk"
01:53:40;01:53:49;"Sensuality lust anything is valid subject matter. That's right. We should point out that Ed Sheeran gave"
01:53:49;01:53:54;"Songwriting credits on this song recently to the people who wrote TLC no scrubs. Oh"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"whoa"
01:53:56;01:54:01;"Whoa like like 18 years ago, whatever. Yeah, I was old I guess cuz I"
01:54:01;01:54:05;"Mean wait what cuz there's the part of his song where he goes"
01:54:05;01:54:10;"I may be crazy don't mind me say boy. Let's not talk too much"
01:54:10;01:54:14;"I guess"
01:54:14;01:54:22;"It's a stretch I think is a stretch personally"
01:54:22;01:54:28;"Ed Sheeran there's like a billion songs like that without cadence it sure and I think has been sued a lot lately"
01:54:28;01:54:33;"So he's probably little he has yeah the Marvin Gaye's family sued him for"
01:54:33;01:54:36;"he has a song that kind of the similar groove and"
01:54:36;01:54:39;"some melodic similarities to"
01:54:39;01:54:45;"Let's get it on. Oh, really cuz let's get it on and Ed Sheeran goes cuz baby I"
01:54:45;01:54:49;"know didn't da da da da since 17"
01:54:49;01:54:58;"Let me into your loving oh, I don't know I always think that when it comes to suing people"
01:54:58;01:55:02;"You should err on the side of a you know what I'm saying?"
01:55:02;01:55:07;"Yeah, there's been 10 million pop songs was gonna be a little crossover. I understand that"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"People"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"first of all"
01:55:11;01:55:17;"There was once this like some commercials for some like random movie that had like these like brutal fake vampire weekend songs in it"
01:55:17;01:55:21;"It was like funny. Oh really one was fake a punk and then right after they played fake Oxford comma"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"and I just remember like watching those and being like"
01:55:24;01:55:31;"You know we could go get the musicologist and try to be like mmm. That's clearly based on this another part of me was like"
01:55:32;01:55:35;"Clearly this is somebody making a whack version of our song"
01:55:35;01:55:43;"Case closed. It's funny like it's funny and also. I mean what if that song had gone and become a huge hit"
01:55:43;01:55:48;"Well, that's interesting watching. It was a bad horror movie. No. It's just some random like comedy"
01:55:48;01:55:53;"It's like a low-budget comedy or so yeah, what if someone wrote like a blatant a punk rip?"
01:55:53;01:55:56;"instead of"
01:56:00;01:56:04;"Some like weird version it's hard to know where to draw the line it was like it was like number one"
01:56:04;01:56:10;"Well, that's an interesting question because then some party has to say okay, so the fact that it went number one"
01:56:10;01:56:14;"That's what made me finally sue is because I saw dollar signs"
01:56:14;01:56:19;"That's kind of like not that strong not a good look for you or and then I guess you know the lawyer would definitely make"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"the case"
01:56:20;01:56:24;"This song clearly inspired by a punk is now"
01:56:25;01:56:32;"Representing itself in the marketplace doing grave damage to the commercial potential of my clients song ape"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"and even that is like I"
01:56:34;01:56:37;"Don't know man like like you know where do you draw the line like somebody could be like?"
01:56:37;01:56:40;"What's an example of like somebody who's?"
01:56:40;01:56:43;"Like has a similar vibe to somebody else"
01:56:43;01:56:50;"I don't know remember we said about the Libertines unless some are the Libertines were kind of like the English strokes, right?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"They looked similar"
01:56:51;01:56:56;"But they did their own things. It's still different that you still know that they're two different things"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"You know what it's like the stroke sued the Libertines"
01:56:59;01:57:04;"I almost feel like that's gonna happen we're gonna get to a point where like that happens where people are just like"
01:57:04;01:57:10;"You know I remember that guy skeet all rich and everybody was like oh yeah, he looks like Johnny Depp, okay?"
01:57:10;01:57:14;"He was just a dude who looked like Johnny Depp, and no he's a fine actor"
01:57:14;01:57:19;"But yeah, and people were just like oh, he's a fake Johnny Depp. He's the budget Johnny Depp people talk that way about actors a lot"
01:57:20;01:57:25;"Or sometimes you think that you did something so original the company somebody takes a similar idea and does it better?"
01:57:25;01:57:32;"You gotta just like take that L. Take that L. Skeet or she really looks like Johnny Depp, but you couldn't sue for I mean"
01:57:32;01:57:40;"But yeah, that's the more thing with actors with like someone is like the poor man's version of so-and-so"
01:57:40;01:57:47;"Different with music you know no of course it's different music. I just think"
01:57:49;01:57:54;"Ethically I'm not saying I would never sue somebody. I would just try to draw the line as"
01:57:54;01:58:01;"Charitably as possible right also. You know it's tough. There's also the thing about honesty"
01:58:01;01:58:05;"It's like sometimes you can be inspired by song and just like lie about it"
01:58:05;01:58:08;"But it's like if somebody comes to you and is like hey listen your song inspired it"
01:58:08;01:58:13;"Yeah, and then you're like okay. You're directly saying that you based it off of this. Yeah, all right. Thank you"
01:58:13;01:58:18;"Give you my piece, but if you just hear something, and I'm like"
01:58:18;01:58:22;"Where you know we're talking about kids don't stand a chance before bum bum bum bum bum"
01:58:22;01:58:28;"That's such a basic idea if somebody came out something went bum bum bum bum mama"
01:58:28;01:58:36;"Mom mama mama and had the same drum groove. I'd have to be like all right. This is inspired by what we did"
01:58:36;01:58:39;"but like"
01:58:39;01:58:44;"Whatever, it's lame. I don't know. I don't know that yeah, well if they had a different vocal and you know"
01:58:45;01:58:51;"Whatever Ed Sheeran is that's it's over the line. I think that he had to like give writing credit"
01:58:51;01:58:54;"Oh, maybe he's probably just scared of getting sued that sucks although"
01:58:54;01:59:00;"Maybe he got away with some other theft, and he was like this is my penance heavy"
01:59:00;01:59:03;"Well, those are the top five songs of 2017 in 1989"
01:59:03;01:59:09;"Well Jake there's a hell of an episode. Yeah, we talked to Raj holder lush life"
01:59:10;01:59:14;"We talked to Jonathan Wolfe composer of the Seinfeld theme song"
01:59:14;01:59:19;"And we counted down the hits one more key asked for I will see everybody in two weeks. Thank you"
01:59:19;01:59:28;"One"
