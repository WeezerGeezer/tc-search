00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, the 25th episode."
00:05;00:09;"I'm joined by my co-host, Jake Longstreth, in the studio."
00:09;00:14;"As we discuss Cookies, John Galliano."
00:14;00:20;"We count down the songs of the summer with actor and comedian, Jarrod Carmichael."
00:20;00:27;"All this, plus the top five songs on iTunes, cross-referenced with the CMJ charts."
00:27;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:37;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, one."
00:37;00:44;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"The war I've felt, I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I delve to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:21;"I'll be the lonely man."
01:21;01:27;"Time Crisis, episode 25. TC25. Can you believe it, Jake?"
01:27;01:29;"Sort of."
01:29;01:31;"We've done 25 episodes?"
01:31;01:32;"That's crazy."
01:32;01:36;"This show really is a time crisis. What have you been up to, Jake?"
01:36;01:40;"Just grinding in the studio, back at it."
01:40;01:41;"Painting?"
01:41;01:42;"Mm-hmm."
01:42;01:45;"What do you think about August? I talked with somebody today who said that August is the worst month."
01:45;01:46;"I love it."
01:46;01:47;"You love August?"
01:47;01:48;"It's one of my favorites."
01:48;01:49;"Is that just your contrarian nature?"
01:49;01:54;"No, I like that it's mellow. I like that a lot of things kind of like chill out, shut down."
01:54;01:57;"I hate that like back to school feeling."
01:57;02:01;"And even though I haven't been in school in many, many years, I know in September,"
02:01;02:06;"and even like seeing like driving by like a school with an LED sign on the front that says like,"
02:06;02:09;"""Classes start August 17th."""
02:09;02:14;"I'm just like, ""Dude, are you serious? That's so brutal."""
02:14;02:19;"I get bummed for people having to go back to school, and especially mid-August,"
02:19;02:24;"which is like emotionally and psychologically not the time to go."
02:24;02:30;"You're just ripping across Fountain in your minivan, cranking some tunes,"
02:30;02:33;"and then you just drive past like a high school."
02:33;02:38;"It's like a local L.A. high school that's like, ""Sign up for clubs first week back,"""
02:38;02:41;"and you're just like, ""See that?"" Just shake your head."
02:41;02:42;"Man."
02:42;02:48;"Back to school, back to school, to prove to dad that I'm not a fool."
02:48;02:52;"School's out for summer. I mean, I like the dog days of summer."
02:52;02:55;"I like that expression. I like the long days."
02:55;03:00;"I like it when it's hot, but you know, you can go at your own pace a little bit."
03:00;03:02;"Things really do slow down."
03:02;03:05;"The world is going to pick up again in September, and I'm fine with that."
03:05;03:08;"I'm ready to really start cranking with the rest of the world,"
03:08;03:13;"but I like guilt-free leisure vibes in August."
03:13;03:16;"I feel like in Europe, this is when everybody goes on vacation."
03:16;03:17;"Right."
03:17;03:19;"Paid vacation."
03:19;03:22;"So I feel like over there, it's like things slow down"
03:22;03:27;"because people are leaving the cities, going to explore a little bit,"
03:27;03:31;"get some fresh air, go to the mountains, go to the beach or something,"
03:31;03:35;"whereas I feel like in America it's like grinding it out in August."
03:35;03:37;"You kind of just feel like you're left behind."
03:37;03:38;"Yeah, if you're just working."
03:38;03:41;"Working through August. It's not a holiday for me."
03:41;03:43;"How about you, August?"
03:43;03:45;"Eh. It's okay."
03:45;03:47;"Are you a summer guy? Are you pumped for fall?"
03:47;03:49;"Yeah, depending on where I am."
03:49;03:51;"L.A. doesn't really have much of a fall."
03:51;03:54;"In fact, L.A., sometimes September is hotter than August."
03:54;03:55;"True."
03:55;03:59;"So yeah, of course I love an East Coast autumn."
03:59;04:01;"Yeah, August is kind of lame."
04:01;04:04;"I remember when I was a kid, you get July and August off."
04:04;04:06;"July was like Saturday."
04:06;04:07;"Yeah."
04:07;04:09;"I just thought of that, man."
04:09;04:12;"July and August are the Saturday and Sunday of summer."
04:12;04:14;"Yeah."
04:14;04:16;"Sunday is pretty rad, though."
04:16;04:17;"You like Sundays?"
04:17;04:19;"Well, no, I feel you."
04:19;04:22;"There's nothing like the exhilaration of being in seventh grade"
04:22;04:25;"and it's mid-July and you're just like--"
04:25;04:26;"Right."
04:26;04:27;"There's like seven weeks of summer,"
04:27;04:29;"which seems like an eternity when you're that age."
04:29;04:31;"Yeah. No, yes, it's important."
04:31;04:33;"Context is important. You know you've got this time coming up."
04:33;04:35;"August is a month of Sundays."
04:35;04:37;"Man, I just thought of that."
04:37;04:38;"That's a lyric, dude."
04:38;04:39;"Start working on that."
04:39;04:42;"The dog days are over"
04:42;04:45;"The dog days are done"
04:45;04:48;"The horses are coming"
04:48;04:51;"So you better run"
04:51;04:53;"Run fast for your mother"
04:53;04:55;"Run fast for your father"
04:55;04:56;"Run for your children"
04:56;04:57;"Run for your sisters"
04:57;04:58;"Run for your brothers"
04:58;05:01;"Leave all your love and your glory behind"
05:01;05:04;"You can't carry it with you if you want to survive"
05:04;05:07;"The dog days are over"
05:07;05:11;"The dog days are done"
05:11;05:14;"Hey, the heroes are here"
05:14;05:16;"The heroes are here"
05:16;05:19;"They come"
05:19;05:21;"Moving on."
05:21;05:24;"Jake, do you know who Toots Thielmans is?"
05:24;05:25;"No, I don't."
05:25;05:26;"It's a name I always remember"
05:26;05:28;"because in the early days of Vampire Weekend,"
05:28;05:31;"we'd go do European press tours,"
05:31;05:34;"get to spend a lot of time with the label rep"
05:34;05:36;"in different countries."
05:36;05:38;"I feel like once we were doing an interview or something"
05:38;05:42;"with our label guy, Jan, in Belgium,"
05:42;05:46;"and somehow we were just talking about Belgian history,"
05:46;05:48;"Belgian pride,"
05:48;05:50;"and maybe he was just like,"
05:50;05:51;"""What Belgians do you know?"""
05:51;05:53;"Luc Toymans."
05:53;05:54;"Who's that?"
05:54;05:55;"Painter."
05:55;05:56;"Oh, wait, from back in the day?"
05:56;05:57;"No, contemporary."
05:57;05:58;"All right."
05:58;05:59;"Not familiar."
05:59;06:02;"I was like, ""Who are truly internationally famous Belgians?"""
06:02;06:03;"Like, household names."
06:03;06:05;"And I was like, ""Jean-Claude Van Damme,"""
06:05;06:07;"and then it's like steep drop-off,"
06:07;06:08;"and I was like, ""Damn, man."""
06:08;06:09;"Hercule Poirot."
06:09;06:10;"Who's that?"
06:10;06:12;"The Agatha Christie detective."
06:12;06:14;"Oh, fictional character doesn't count."
06:14;06:16;"And Agatha Christie wasn't Belgian."
06:16;06:17;"So I was like, ""It's no diss,"
06:17;06:21;"""but is the one truly internationally famous Belgian"
06:21;06:23;"""Jean-Claude Van Damme?"""
06:23;06:25;"And they're like, ""No, of course not."
06:25;06:28;"""The best harmonica player in the world is Belgian."""
06:28;06:32;"And I was like, ""John Popper is from New Jersey."""
06:32;06:33;"And they were like--"
06:33;06:34;"Who's that?"
06:34;06:35;"Yeah, exactly."
06:35;06:36;"They're like, ""Who's John Popper?"""
06:36;06:37;"And I was like, ""He was the lead singer"
06:37;06:41;"""and harmonica player in 'Blues Traveler.'"""
06:41;06:43;"And he was almost like, ""Yo, keep your voice down."
06:43;06:45;"""He is not the best harmonica player in the world."""
06:45;06:46;"I was like, ""Yeah, he is."
06:46;06:47;"""Everybody kind of agrees."""
06:47;06:48;"He's like, ""No, of course not."
06:48;06:49;"""It's Tooth Sillman."""
06:49;06:50;"And I was like, ""Who's that?"""
06:50;06:52;"And he's like, ""You seriously don't know who this dude is?"""
06:52;06:53;"And he was probably right."
06:53;06:54;"I probably should have."
06:54;06:57;"But he was like, ""He's one of the most famous Belgians."""
06:57;06:58;"Hmm."
06:58;07:00;"""He's the best harmonica player in the world."""
07:00;07:02;"And I was like, ""Is it on some, like,"
07:02;07:04;"""Belgium's Got Talent type thing?"
07:04;07:05;"""Like, he's just really good?"""
07:05;07:08;"And he's like, ""No, he's like the Miles Davis of harmonica."""
07:08;07:10;"And then I was like, read up on this guy,"
07:10;07:13;"and I was like, ""Oh, wow, this guy is, like, really serious."
07:13;07:15;"""He, like, pioneered jazz harmonica,"
07:15;07:16;"""and he truly was one of the best players,"
07:16;07:18;"""and he played with all sorts of people."""
07:18;07:20;"So this was maybe eight years ago."
07:20;07:22;"I was just an ignorant American."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:26;"This is my equivalent of the Ryan Lochte story."
07:26;07:28;"Just a dumb American abroad."
07:28;07:30;"And after that, I always tried to, you know,"
07:30;07:32;"correct my behavior and be like, you know,"
07:32;07:34;"show respect and love to Tooth Sillman."
07:34;07:37;"And I was very sad last week to see that he died at the age of 94."
07:37;07:40;"And so I want to pay so that other people"
07:40;07:42;"don't make the same ignorant mistake that I made"
07:42;07:45;"and think that John Popper is the most famous harmonica player in the world."
07:45;07:48;"I want to pay tribute to this man."
07:48;07:50;"And just to give you a-- 'cause, like, some people probably--"
07:50;07:53;"it's hard to even picture what it means to be great at harmonica."
07:53;07:55;"Yeah, I'm drawing a blank here."
07:55;07:59;"He was known for usually playing jazz."
07:59;08:01;"He had, like, a band of other Belgians."
08:01;08:03;"He played with everybody."
08:03;08:06;"So he came to the States and, like, had a pickup band and toured,"
08:06;08:09;"or would, like, sit in with, like, Miles Davis quintet or something?"
08:09;08:11;"Yeah, I don't want to say exactly who,"
08:11;08:14;"but, like, he definitely worked with Quincy Jones."
08:14;08:16;"People--real jazz people."
08:16;08:18;"Here's him playing ""I Love You, Porgy."""
08:18;08:20;"You know, Gershwin jazz standard."
08:20;08:22;"So what year are we talking here?"
08:22;08:24;"Like '60s, '50s?"
08:24;08:26;"Ooh."
08:26;08:29;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
08:29;08:38;"This is a live recording."
08:38;08:43;"You know, that's a difficult instrument to, like, articulate on."
08:43;08:45;"Very."
08:45;08:48;"Most kids had a harmonica at some point, and you play it, it's like..."
08:48;08:54;"Listen to the dynamics."
08:55;08:57;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
08:57;08:59;"I would not have guessed that's a harmonica."
08:59;09:01;"I would have thought it was an accordion."
09:01;09:03;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
09:03;09:06;"So that's kind of him doing, like, his more standard jazz stuff."
09:06;09:09;"So a lot of people probably feel like, oh, that's interesting,"
09:09;09:12;"it's kind of like a quirk, but a lot of people don't realize"
09:12;09:15;"they've heard this guy's work because he played on all sorts of stuff."
09:15;09:17;"Like, you might remember this."
09:17;09:20;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
09:20;09:22;"That's Toots."
09:23;09:25;"Okay."
09:25;09:27;"You recognize it?"
09:27;09:29;"Give me a second. Yeah, Sesame Street."
09:29;09:31;"Sesame Street."
09:31;09:33;"Is this the original?"
09:33;09:35;"I think so."
09:35;09:37;"Sounds good."
09:37;09:43;"It's kind of like ""Love Me Do."""
09:43;09:45;"Yeah."
09:45;09:48;"Almost like-- or like a weird outtake of Pet Sounds."
09:48;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"Oh, he totally could have, like, played on some Brahms."
09:52;09:54;"Some, like, weird Wrecking Crew stuff."
09:54;09:56;"Yeah, he would have been the harmonica in the Wrecking Crew."
09:56;09:58;"Yeah."
09:58;10:00;"He even played with a Time Crisis favorite."
10:00;10:02;"Well, let me guess. Yeah, guess."
10:02;10:04;"Herb Alpert. More of a favorite."
10:04;10:06;"Like from the '60s? Gary Puckett?"
10:06;10:08;"No, no, no, no."
10:08;10:10;"No, you're going too deep."
10:10;10:12;"Someone that we actually had on the show? No."
10:12;10:15;"Someone that definitely comes up in conversation."
10:15;10:17;"Legendary artist. Oh, Peter Cetera."
10:17;10:19;"No, you're going way too deep, man."
10:19;10:21;"Too deep?"
10:21;10:23;"I'm talking about, like, a major artist."
10:23;10:27;"A major artist who had a touch of jazz in his pop music,"
10:27;10:30;"who had a lot of shredder musicians on his records."
10:30;10:32;"MJ?"
10:32;10:34;"Getting warmer, I guess."
10:34;10:36;"Um..."
10:36;10:39;"Let me try to think. I'm guessing here, but..."
10:39;10:41;"Maybe about a... Give me, like, a decade here."
10:41;10:44;"Five, five, five, four, Caucasian male."
10:44;10:46;"Paul Simon?"
10:46;10:48;"I think Paul Simon's probably less than five, four."
10:48;10:50;"Taller than Paul Simon."
10:50;10:52;"Caucasian male."
10:52;10:54;"From the greater New York area."
10:54;10:56;"Joel. Joel."
10:56;10:58;"Finally. Okay, okay."
10:58;11:00;"So he played on Billy's song,"
11:00;11:03;"""Leave a Tender Moment Alone,"" from ""An Innocent Man."""
11:03;11:05;"Deeper cut?"
11:05;11:07;"Ooh. Oh, no, this is a classic."
11:07;11:12;"It's like they're talking to each other."
11:12;11:14;"So Billy was just like, ""Get toots in here."""
11:14;11:16;"Yeah, I guess so."
11:16;11:18;"Ooh. It kind of almost reminds me"
11:18;11:21;"a little bit of that Stevie Wonder harmonica tone."
11:21;11:23;"Yeah."
11:23;11:27;"# Even though I'm in love"
11:27;11:30;"# Sometimes I get so afraid"
11:30;11:32;"What year is this?"
11:32;11:34;"I think, like, '80s."
11:34;11:38;"This sounds huge."
11:38;11:42;"# I know the moment isn't right"
11:42;11:44;"'83."
11:44;11:47;"# To tell the girl to come a good life... #"
11:47;11:49;"This is from his, like, his throwback album."
11:49;11:51;"# ...So I'm gonna let you lie... #"
11:51;11:53;"Is this the one with ""Uptown Girl"" on it?"
11:53;11:55;"Yeah, same album. Oh, okay."
11:55;11:57;"# ...I'm just frightened out of my mind"
11:57;12:01;"# But if that's how I feel"
12:01;12:05;"# Then it's the best feeling I've ever known... #"
12:05;12:07;"Yeah, this kind of has, like..."
12:07;12:09;"This could have been, like, a kind of schmaltzy ballad"
12:09;12:12;"in the top five of 1968."
12:12;12:14;"Right."
12:14;12:16;"# Yes, I know I'm in love... #"
12:16;12:18;"Listen to that. Just two great men."
12:18;12:20;"They're in dialogue."
12:20;12:23;"# But just when I ought to relax"
12:23;12:25;"# I put my foot in the door... #"
12:25;12:28;"This is before the days of high-speed Internet connection"
12:28;12:30;"across the Atlantic."
12:30;12:32;"Toots visited Metsa Studios."
12:32;12:34;"Oh, yeah, it's sad to imagine, but today,"
12:34;12:36;"if Billy Joel and Toots were working together,"
12:36;12:38;"Billy would probably be like..."
12:38;12:40;"""I'm not leaving my house."""
12:40;12:42;"Or, like, a producer or something."
12:42;12:44;"""Hey, you know any good harmonica players?"""
12:44;12:47;"""Yeah, Billy, man, there's this real great cat out in Brussels."""
12:47;12:50;"And he'd be like, ""Well, have him email us a potential solo."
12:50;12:52;"""Tell him to do five different takes."
12:52;12:54;"""Pick the best one, comp it together."
12:54;12:56;"""I'm gonna, uh..."""
12:56;12:58;"""Comp it together."""
12:58;13:00;"""I'm gonna go play Pokemon Go outside."""
13:00;13:02;"That's brutal."
13:02;13:04;"But, like, there really is something, that song in Sesame Street,"
13:04;13:06;"there's something just feel-good about Toots' playing."
13:06;13:08;"Yeah."
13:08;13:10;"I think everybody can maybe, you know,"
13:10;13:12;"take a second to Google Toots Thielman's."
13:12;13:15;"Obviously, keep his family and friends in our thoughts."
13:15;13:18;"But '94 is, like, that's a hell of a long time to live."
13:18;13:21;"And clearly this guy left behind a huge body of work."
13:21;13:24;"It's a great run, man. May we all be so lucky."
13:24;13:27;"Clearly he dedicated himself to something."
13:27;13:29;"Very specific, too."
13:29;13:31;"Very specific."
13:31;13:33;"That's really interesting."
13:33;13:35;"He owned a land."
13:35;13:40;"# #"
14:04;14:07;"That was some more music from the legendary Toots Thielman."
14:07;14:09;"Rest in peace."
14:09;14:11;"Coming up on the show, we got Gerard Carmichael,"
14:11;14:13;"long-time friend of the show, coming through."
14:13;14:15;"Haven't seen him in a minute."
14:15;14:17;"Cool."
14:17;14:19;"We're gonna be talking about the songs of the summer."
14:19;14:21;"Now that we're in the dog days of summer,"
14:21;14:23;"we can officially say what the songs of the summer were."
14:23;14:25;"And then we're gonna be getting into the top five"
14:25;14:27;"with a back-to-school special."
14:27;14:30;"We're gonna compare the top five songs on iTunes,"
14:30;14:32;"which is maybe a slightly more populist version"
14:32;14:34;"of what people are listening to,"
14:34;14:36;"and then we're gonna compare with the top five songs"
14:36;14:38;"on the CMJ charts, which is about college radio."
14:38;14:40;"I didn't even know that was a thing still."
14:40;14:42;"Yeah, as long as there's colleges"
14:42;14:44;"and as long as there's college radio, man,"
14:44;14:46;"there'll be a college radio chart."
14:46;14:48;"And there's the dudes that are working"
14:48;14:50;"at the college radio station."
14:50;14:52;"Yeah. Did you ever do college radio?"
14:52;14:54;"Yeah. What was your show all about?"
14:54;14:56;"It's called ""The Jake and Dave Show."""
14:56;14:58;"I had a friend named Dave Kolek,"
14:58;15:00;"and it was kind of a talk format."
15:00;15:02;"From ""Time Crisis."""
15:02;15:04;"My freshman-- I guess it would've been my sophomore year."
15:04;15:07;"We had a discussion about the future of the Internet,"
15:07;15:09;"which would be an amazing tape to find."
15:09;15:11;"Wow. Can you look for that?"
15:11;15:13;"Dave has it. I'll ask him."
15:13;15:15;"Oh, I'd love to play that on ""Time Crisis."""
15:15;15:17;"That'd be hilarious."
15:17;15:19;"Just a couple Lewis and Clark undergrads."
15:19;15:23;"We had this soci-- or I think a poli-sci professor on"
15:23;15:25;"to discuss the Internet in 1996."
15:25;15:27;"Wait, you know, that's interesting, man."
15:27;15:29;"That's something I've been thinking about lately."
15:29;15:32;"Whenever I find myself feeling, like, overwhelmed"
15:32;15:34;"or dissatisfied with the world,"
15:34;15:36;"I talk about it with people."
15:36;15:40;"I'm often, like-- it's very easy for us to point to the Internet"
15:40;15:43;"as being one of the major things"
15:43;15:47;"that's causing even more misery in people's lives today."
15:47;15:51;"It's like everybody is a little bit addicted to their phone,"
15:51;15:54;"the constant stream of, like, information and opinions."
15:54;15:56;"How much time do you spend on the Internet?"
15:56;15:58;"That's a good question."
15:58;16:01;"So you mean, like, how much time am I spending a day"
16:01;16:03;"interfacing with, like, a computer screen?"
16:03;16:05;"Yeah, or how much do you check your phone?"
16:05;16:07;"And not counting, like, anomalous,"
16:07;16:09;"'cause I know, like, maybe on a Sunday afternoon"
16:09;16:11;"you might spend four hours"
16:11;16:14;"just, like, on the Grateful Dead tabs website."
16:14;16:16;"You're not wrong."
16:16;16:19;"I just mean kind of, like, mindless Internet consumption."
16:19;16:21;"I'll probably do an hour a day."
16:21;16:23;"Total? Yeah."
16:23;16:26;"Like, when I'm eating lunch, like, when I'm at my studio"
16:26;16:29;"and I'm editing, I, like, make a turkey sandwich or something,"
16:29;16:31;"and I'm just, like, laptop open."
16:31;16:33;"You just munch it on the turkey sandwich?"
16:33;16:35;"Yeah. Just what are you scrolling?"
16:35;16:37;"Twitter? New York Times?"
16:37;16:39;"Not really the Times. Twitter, Pitchfork."
16:39;16:41;"Wall Street Journal? Yeah, whatever."
16:41;16:43;"Facebook. And then usually I find an article,"
16:43;16:45;"you click on it, and then you go from there."
16:45;16:47;"What about when you get home at the end of the day?"
16:47;16:49;"No. When you spend time with your girlfriend?"
16:49;16:51;"Yeah. And if she's not home..."
16:51;16:53;"You're not on the Internet."
16:53;16:56;"Glass of tequila, grab the guitar,"
16:56;16:58;"start working on those Dead tabs."
17:23;17:41;"What about you?"
17:41;17:43;">> I'm a little bit like an addict."
17:43;17:45;">> Are you? >> But also an addict in the sense"
17:45;17:48;"that it can be a little like feast or famine."
17:48;17:50;"I'll be like start checking a lot and I'll be like burnout."
17:50;17:52;"I'll like see some things I don't wanna see."
17:52;17:56;"Whether it's like people saying things to me or even, even increasingly when I see"
17:56;18:00;"people getting in fights with each other, I'm almost feel like on some like,"
18:00;18:03;"what was that movie with the zombies?"
18:03;18:04;"28 days later."
18:04;18:05;">> Yeah. >> You know when they got infected"
18:05;18:06;"with rage."
18:06;18:09;"I increasingly when I see like other people being horrible to each other,"
18:09;18:11;"I really feel like it's gonna like infect me."
18:11;18:12;">> Do you see that on Twitter?"
18:12;18:12;"Where do you see that?"
18:12;18:14;">> Yeah, see maybe, you probably just have-"
18:14;18:16;">> I'm not a famous musician, dude."
18:16;18:17;">> You just gotta cleaner feed."
18:17;18:19;">> My Twitter situation is like mellow."
18:19;18:20;">> Right, but come on, it's an election year."
18:20;18:24;"Surely you've seen some like people getting in fights about ideology or"
18:24;18:25;"politics."
18:25;18:26;">> Yeah, but it's not, I mean."
18:26;18:27;">> Yeah, well, so whatever."
18:27;18:30;"Sometimes I see that stuff and it bothers me and I'm like, yo."
18:30;18:32;">> I'm out. >> Let me just like read my book."
18:32;18:33;">> Nice. >> And then I'll start reading my book."
18:33;18:35;">> What are you reading?"
18:35;18:39;">> I'm reading a book called, it seems like really random because I've always"
18:39;18:45;"loved fashion, but I don't know, the reason time crisis we talk about music and"
18:45;18:47;"not fashion is because I know more about music."
18:47;18:50;"And fashion often has struck me as a world so"
18:50;18:54;"similar to music in terms of like the characters, the signifiers, whatever."
18:54;18:57;"But I'm a little bit like grandpa when it comes to learning about that stuff."
18:57;18:59;"So I was at the bookstore the other day and"
18:59;19:01;"I saw this book called Gods and Kings."
19:01;19:04;"And it's about Alexander McQueen and John Galliano."
19:04;19:08;"And I was like, man, these are two incredibly famous people."
19:08;19:11;"Many people consider iconic, and I know very little about them."
19:11;19:16;"All I know about John Galliano is that he got caught on tape saying anti-Semitic"
19:16;19:18;"stuff drunk at a Paris bar."
19:18;19:22;"And all I really know about Alexander McQueen is that someone once gave me"
19:22;19:26;"Alexander McQueen pea coat, which I love, and I know that he killed himself."
19:26;19:28;"So I know these kind of like dark, sad things about these people."
19:28;19:30;">> I've never even heard of Galliano."
19:30;19:31;">> Really? >> Yeah."
19:31;19:33;">> He was a famous designer in his own right, and"
19:33;19:38;"then he really became famous when he became the head designer for Dior."
19:38;19:39;">> Okay. >> You know Dior, right?"
19:39;19:41;">> Yeah, I mean, I'm familiar with it as a brand that exists."
19:41;19:44;">> And you're familiar with the types of fabrics they use and"
19:44;19:47;"the silhouettes that they're famous for and their haute couture."
19:47;19:49;">> Mm, not really."
19:49;19:51;">> John Galliano is also interesting."
19:51;19:55;"But you didn't hear about this, and then he got dismissed from Dior."
19:55;19:56;">> No, was this recently?"
19:56;19:57;">> This is like a few years ago."
19:57;19:59;">> This is an offshoot of Time Crisis."
19:59;20:01;"This is our new show."
20:01;20:03;">> You know what, this is Time Crisis Fashion Edition."
20:13;20:22;">> Rest in peace, David Bowie."
20:22;20:25;"This is a new segment on Time Crisis."
20:25;20:26;"It's called Fashion."
20:26;20:29;"So Jake, I wanna tell you more about John Galliano."
20:29;20:29;">> Okay, yeah, yeah."
20:29;20:34;"He was already very famous in certain circles, but the story blew up because"
20:34;20:38;"he was caught on video, somebody taped it on his phone,"
20:38;20:42;"saying a series of really hateful, cruel, and anti-Semitic things."
20:42;20:45;">> Fashion. >> To a couple of people at a bar in"
20:45;20:46;"Paris, and you can tell he's intoxicated."
20:46;20:47;"He says- >> When?"
20:47;20:49;">> I don't know, three years ago?"
20:49;20:50;">> Okay, recently."
20:50;20:52;">> So this is like a guy at the top of the fashion game."
20:52;20:55;"He's like the head designer for one of the biggest fashion houses."
20:55;20:57;"And he's there, I forget what he says."
20:57;20:58;"He says, you're ugly."
20:58;20:59;">> Fashion."
20:59;21:00;">> It's kind of like- >> Is he American?"
21:00;21:02;">> He was British."
21:02;21:03;">> It's like the Mel Gibson vibe."
21:03;21:05;">> It was like a Mel Gibson vibe."
21:05;21:06;"It's like some Zoolander."
21:06;21:10;"It's like the worst nightmare of what a big designer would be like."
21:10;21:12;"Like mean, catty, and hateful."
21:12;21:13;">> Fashion."
21:13;21:14;">> You know?"
21:14;21:19;"So he literally is there drunk, just being like, saying to this person, you're ugly."
21:19;21:19;">> Fashion."
21:19;21:20;">> I love Hitler."
21:20;21:21;">> Fashion."
21:21;21:22;">> So obviously it was outrageous."
21:22;21:26;"People were horrified, quickly condemned, dismissed."
21:26;21:27;">> Uh-huh."
21:27;21:28;">> Went to rehab, whatever."
21:28;21:31;"But I remember that whole story."
21:31;21:32;"I mean, clearly he needed it."
21:32;21:35;"But I remember during that whole story, I was like,"
21:35;21:39;"obviously the headline is John Galliano is horrible anti-Semite, right?"
21:39;21:40;">> Right."
21:40;21:42;">> And I'm not saying that he's not, but I just remember when I heard that story,"
21:42;21:45;"another part of me was like, what is this rich,"
21:45;21:49;"famous fashion designer doing sitting alone at a bar by himself?"
21:49;21:51;"It is very Gibson vibe."
21:51;21:54;"Like you get down to it and you're just kind of like,"
21:54;21:56;"I'm not saying that you have to like him."
21:56;22:00;"He said really horrendous things, but then the human interest part of me was just"
22:00;22:02;"kind of like- >> What was going on?"
22:02;22:03;">> Why were you by yourself?"
22:03;22:05;"You can go for a drink by yourself, sure, but"
22:05;22:09;"why are you just like plastered at a bar in Paris like alone?"
22:09;22:10;">> Yikes."
22:10;22:13;">> So whatever, I haven't gotten to the end of the book, but"
22:13;22:15;"being a fashion designer, very difficult."
22:15;22:17;">> Grueling and cutthroat."
22:17;22:18;">> It's grueling and cutthroat."
22:18;22:19;">> What little I know."
22:19;22:22;">> Yeah, it's like the music industry to the nth degree."
22:22;22:23;">> Right."
22:23;22:28;">> And that concludes our new segment on Time Crisis."
22:28;22:29;">> Fashion."
22:29;22:30;">> We'll revisit that one."
22:30;22:34;"We'll catch up with, maybe we can get John Galliano on the show sometime."
22:34;22:35;">> That'd be tight."
22:35;22:36;">> Fashion."
22:36;22:37;"Turn to the left."
22:37;22:38;"Fashion."
22:38;22:39;"Turn to the right."
22:39;22:44;"Ooh, fashion."
22:44;22:47;"We are the Goon Squad and we're coming to town."
22:47;22:48;"Beep beep."
22:48;22:52;"Beep beep."
22:52;22:57;">> Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
22:57;23:00;">> Filling in for our regular host, Fareed Zachariah."
23:00;23:01;">> Beep beep beep beep beep."
23:01;23:02;">> Beats."
23:02;23:03;">> Four."
23:03;23:04;">> One."
24:18;24:21;">> We're really covering a lot of ground on today's Time Crisis."
24:21;24:23;"TC25."
24:23;24:23;">> Ramblin' Man."
24:23;24:25;">> It's a major show."
24:25;24:27;"Lord, I was born a ramblin' man."
24:27;24:28;">> [SOUND]"
24:28;24:29;">> What's the next line?"
24:29;24:33;">> Trying to make a living and doing the best I can."
24:33;24:33;">> That's true too."
24:33;24:35;"I can really relate to that song."
24:35;24:40;">> When it's time for leaving, I hope you'll understand."
24:40;24:43;"Lord, I was born a ramblin' man."
24:43;24:47;"So as we wait for Gerard to come in and talk about the songs of the summer,"
24:47;24:49;"we got time to kill."
24:49;24:49;"But you know what?"
24:49;24:54;"We've been doing market research about what people like about Time Crisis."
24:54;24:56;"They just like just hearing chill bros talking."
24:56;24:58;">> Eating. >> And eating."
24:58;25:02;"We got a lot of positive feedback from the Frito-Lay Corporation when I ate Doritos"
25:02;25:04;"a few shows ago."
25:04;25:06;"So a lot of people don't know this, but"
25:06;25:11;"Seinfeld 2000 is part of the Time Crisis family."
25:11;25:13;"We don't get him on the mic that often, but"
25:13;25:17;"after our infamous beef, we actually gave the man a job."
25:17;25:19;"So he actually works for Time Crisis."
25:19;25:24;"So if you wanna come out of his office, what's up Seinfeld 2000?"
25:24;25:25;">> I'm forever grateful."
25:25;25:27;"Thank you for putting me on."
25:27;25:30;"I'm usually behind the scenes here, but yeah, here I am."
25:30;25:32;">> Well, we're just killing time over here, man."
25:32;25:37;"We thought a good segment to do would be one about cookies,"
25:37;25:42;"because we know that people love Seinfeld 2000, and we know that people love food."
25:42;25:46;"So there happened to be a lot of cookies in the studio today."
25:46;25:49;"So we're just gonna talk about them, maybe even eat a few."
25:49;25:51;"I wanna describe- >> I'll hit one of the Milanos."
25:51;25:53;">> To the listener what we have."
25:53;25:58;"I'm handing Jake a bag of Milanos and their orange chocolate."
25:58;26:00;"Are you mad about that?"
26:00;26:03;">> Yeah, I hate it when they mix fruit with chocolate."
26:03;26:04;">> Really? >> Keep it pure."
26:04;26:06;">> We have Tim Tam."
26:06;26:08;">> [LAUGH]"
26:08;26:11;">> That seems like some British type thing."
26:11;26:12;"We have Fig Newtons."
26:12;26:13;">> Classic."
26:13;26:15;">> Classic, like healthy."
26:15;26:15;">> Yep."
26:15;26:17;">> Are they healthy though?"
26:17;26:21;">> I didn't even realize Fig Newtons were like a legit cookie until picking it up,"
26:21;26:23;"and it says cookie on it."
26:23;26:26;"I thought that was in a class on its own."
26:26;26:30;">> Fig Newtons used to have an ad campaign that was about how they're not cookies."
26:30;26:32;">> Well, they've sold out then,"
26:32;26:35;"cuz I think they're now squarely in the cookie camp."
26:35;26:39;">> We also have three different types of Oreos, none of which are standard."
26:39;26:40;">> I'm not eating Oreos anymore, you know that."
26:40;26:43;">> We have blueberry pie Oreos."
26:43;26:47;"We also have Oreo Thins, and we have birthday cake Oreos."
26:47;26:49;">> Wait, wait, there's no standard Oreos?"
26:49;26:52;">> No, but we do have- >> Wait, who bought these cookies?"
26:52;26:54;">> We do have JoJo's, which are Trader Joe's."
26:54;26:58;">> [LAUGH] >> This is definitely one of the most"
26:58;27:01;"random time crises of all time."
27:01;27:03;">> Can I just say, this is like a thing."
27:03;27:07;"When someone goes to get cookies or bagels or whatever for an office thing,"
27:07;27:09;"they never get the straight up one."
27:09;27:11;"No one gets the straight up Oreo."
27:11;27:18;"They get the blueberry and the birthday cake and the butterscotch Oreo."
27:18;27:21;">> Or wasn't that a major plot point in Home Alone?"
27:21;27:27;"That Kevin was very upset that his family ordered all these unique pizzas,"
27:27;27:29;"and he just wanted plain pizza."
27:29;27:30;">> Right."
27:30;27:35;">> And it's a very cathartic moment later in the film,"
27:35;27:43;"when Kevin sits down at the table of the now almost empty McAllister family home."
27:43;27:47;"And he opens a pizza,"
27:47;27:52;"finally fulfilling the promise of capitalism,"
27:52;27:55;"something just for him."
27:55;27:59;"And he says, a fresh cheese pizza, all for me."
27:59;28:05;"Basically, I think that part of the movie is saying that to fulfill his ultimate"
28:05;28:09;"role as a consumer, getting exactly what he wanted,"
28:09;28:13;"he had to sacrifice the comfort of family."
28:13;28:17;"And ultimately, he places himself in harm's way."
28:17;28:19;">> Worth it."
28:19;28:21;">> Have you seen this film Jake, Home Alone?"
28:21;28:22;">> Not in many years."
28:22;28:23;">> Really?"
28:23;28:26;">> Okay, I gotta return these Oreos, sorry."
28:26;28:28;">> You're not gonna try the blueberry pie Oreos?"
28:28;28:30;">> I'm not eating Oreos anymore, you know that."
28:30;28:31;">> Please try the blueberry pie."
28:31;28:32;">> Wait, did you buy all these?"
28:32;28:33;">> Yeah."
28:33;28:35;"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be so negative."
28:35;28:36;">> It's okay."
28:36;28:40;">> We're trying JoJo's, the Trader Joe's off-brand Oreos."
28:42;28:44;">> Not as good as an Oreo."
28:44;28:45;">> What's the difference?"
28:45;28:47;">> I think it's drier."
28:47;28:48;">> Sweeter too, it's not as tart."
28:48;28:51;">> Tart?"
28:51;28:52;">> It's very, very close."
28:52;28:55;"Oreos, weirdly, the cookie part is very dry."
28:55;29:00;"And then the filling is almost, I don't wanna say moist, but it's not dry."
29:00;29:03;">> It's a very specific chemical state."
29:03;29:05;">> It's probably got silica gel."
29:05;29:06;">> Yeah."
29:08;29:12;">> All right, Jake, you gotta take a bite of a blueberry pie Oreo."
29:12;29:14;">> It's a good looking cookie."
29:14;29:15;">> Is it though?"

29:17;29:19;">> The cookie is, how do they define the cookie?"
29:19;29:23;">> It's sort of like a manila, it's sort of a manila cookie wafer."
29:23;29:24;">> [LAUGH]"
29:24;29:28;">> With a sort of like, just pure purple."
29:28;29:31;">> [LAUGH]"
29:31;29:32;">> You're not feeling the."
29:32;29:33;">> Sick."
29:33;29:34;">> You're not feeling the blueberry Oreo?"
29:34;29:35;">> Why?"
29:35;29:36;"Why is it sick though?"
29:36;29:38;">> Wait, you mean sick in a positive way?"
29:38;29:38;">> No."
29:38;29:40;">> Who uses sick in a negative way these days?"
29:40;29:41;">> True."
29:41;29:42;">> It's ill."
29:42;29:43;">> [LAUGH]"
29:43;29:45;">> It's an ill cookie."
29:45;29:46;">> That's sick."
29:46;29:47;">> Buff cookie."
29:47;29:49;">> [LAUGH]"
29:49;29:51;">> You're finding the blueberry Oreo disgusting?"
29:51;29:53;">> Super buff."
29:53;29:53;">> It's not."
29:53;29:55;">> Do you wanna try birthday cake Oreo?"
29:55;29:55;">> No."
29:55;29:57;">> I'm not eating Oreos anymore, you know that."
29:57;29:58;">> Here's the thing."
29:58;29:59;">> [LAUGH]"
29:59;30:01;">> The filling."
30:01;30:03;"The filling is just over the top."
30:03;30:04;"It's just like."
30:04;30:05;">> Too sweet and."
30:05;30:07;">> Thermonuclear sweetness."
30:07;30:11;"It's just like, I just feel like my tooth is just rotting."
30:11;30:11;"I'm out."
30:11;30:12;"You want it?"
30:12;30:13;">> You're not even gonna finish."
30:13;30:16;"You can't even eat one full blueberry Oreo cookie."
30:16;30:20;">> I'm gonna have a swig of this medicinal red tail amber ale."
30:20;30:21;">> Antiseptic."
30:21;30:25;">> Also, like the beer with the cookie."
30:25;30:25;">> [LAUGH]"
30:25;30:26;">> It's really."
30:26;30:29;">> Beer with cookie is a classic weird combination."
30:29;30:30;"I feel like I've hit it a lot in my life by accident."
30:30;30:33;">> That's like late in the party."
30:33;30:33;">> Right."
30:33;30:35;">> And you're kinda drunk and hungry and you're just like."
30:35;30:39;">> [LAUGH]"
30:39;30:41;">> Man, so what have we learned about cookies?"
30:41;30:44;"Shockingly little."
30:44;30:49;"Maybe we won't bring back the cookie segment, but."
30:49;30:50;">> One and done."
30:50;30:51;">> One and done."
30:51;30:53;"That was something special for Time Crisis 25."
30:53;30:53;">> Nailed it."
31:01;31:03;">> You know what it is."
31:03;31:04;"Jim Classy Road."
31:04;31:14;">> [MUSIC]"
31:34;31:47;">> Okay guys, we've got a very special guest."
31:47;31:47;">> Very special."
31:47;31:49;">> Who just joined us in the studio."
31:49;31:50;"Long time friend of Time Crisis."
31:50;31:52;"It's been a minute since you've been on."
31:52;31:53;">> Yeah. >> We've got Gerard Carmichael."
31:53;31:55;">> Hello everyone."
31:55;31:56;"I like very special."
31:56;31:58;"You feel very special."
31:58;31:59;">> You might be."
31:59;31:59;">> These words work."
31:59;32:01;">> The most frequent guest on Time Crisis."
32:01;32:03;"We kinda stopped having guests."
32:03;32:04;">> Really?"
32:04;32:06;"Yeah, you gotta do that sometimes."
32:06;32:08;"I stopped having guests in my personal life."
32:08;32:09;"So, I get it."
32:09;32:10;">> [LAUGH]"
32:10;32:11;">> Cuz nobody comes."
32:11;32:12;">> Cuz in personal life it's just like, yeah, you know what?"
32:12;32:13;"I'm good."
32:13;32:16;"You look around at the crew you're around, you're like, yeah, I think we're good now."
32:16;32:18;">> Yeah. >> So I, I completely understand the"
32:18;32:19;"sentiment behind that."
32:19;32:21;">> You need alone time."
32:21;32:22;">> Yeah. >> So just real quick."
32:22;32:23;"What are you doing right now?"
32:23;32:26;"You making the next season of the show?"
32:26;32:29;">> We start the room the writers room in like a couple months."
32:29;32:33;"So I'm just like shooting a movie and doing like."
32:33;32:34;">> Okay."
32:34;32:35;">> Writing a lot."
32:35;32:37;"Doing a lot of stand up."
32:37;32:39;"Stand up is like number one."
32:39;32:40;"I'm really excited about it."
32:40;32:41;"Yeah, so just that."
32:41;32:42;"Loitering."
32:42;32:46;">> Well, we got one question for you before we start talking about the songs of"
32:46;32:46;"the summer."
32:46;32:48;">> Yes. >> That's what we thought would be a good"
32:48;32:49;"segment to do."
32:49;32:49;">> I like that."
32:49;32:50;"Songs of the summer."
32:50;32:55;"Before you got here, when we were killing time, we did a cookie segment."
32:55;32:57;"And we were talking about cookies."
32:57;32:58;">> I see the debris."
32:58;33:00;">> And yeah, you see all these weird cookies."
33:00;33:02;"So we just wanted to ask you, because this kind of,"
33:02;33:04;"it became a very passionate topic in the room."
33:04;33:06;">> Yeah. >> We were talking about these limited"
33:06;33:08;"edition blueberry pie Oreos."
33:08;33:10;"Jake was kind of disgusted by them."
33:10;33:13;"I was trying to think about the person who might be excited by it."
33:13;33:17;"So when you come in to the studio and you just see this package of limited edition"
33:17;33:20;"blueberry pie Oreos, what thoughts go through your head?"
33:20;33:23;">> It's like, man, it's so much sadness here."
33:23;33:25;"It's so much, it's like- >> Thank you."
33:25;33:26;">> It's relief."
33:26;33:30;"I will say that these types of food are heroin for"
33:30;33:34;"people who can't commit to heroin."
33:34;33:39;"You look for excitement and you look for these sparks of, when life is hard,"
33:39;33:43;"you need blueberry pie Oreo, when regular Oreos don't do it."
33:43;33:46;"Regular Oreos are just gateway Oreos."
33:46;33:49;"These are when you're maxed out."
33:49;33:51;"It's just like you're working three jobs and it's just like, yeah,"
33:51;33:53;"yeah, no, no, double stuff isn't enough."
33:53;33:56;"I need pie in my Oreos."
33:56;33:57;">> Right. >> Because when life is hard,"
33:57;33:59;"you need that excitement."
33:59;34:03;"When I'm at a really wealthy person's house, their snacks are boring."
34:03;34:06;"Bags of granola."
34:06;34:11;">> Because for a really rich person, their equivalent of that special two weeks in"
34:11;34:16;"August when you bring home the blueberry pie Oreos, for them, it's going on a trip."
34:16;34:18;">> Yeah, you go to San Tropez."
34:18;34:19;">> Yeah, it literally is like-"
34:19;34:20;">> That's your blueberry Oreo."
34:20;34:22;">> I'm so bored of San Tropez."
34:22;34:24;"Maybe this time, let's go to Tahiti."
34:24;34:27;">> Yeah, that's a jolt of excitement."
34:27;34:29;">> And I'm not trying to rich shame."
34:29;34:30;"Everybody needs variety in life."
34:30;34:34;">> But when you do need that burst of excitement, if I can't make it to a bakery,"
34:34;34:38;"and I'm not really around bakeries, I'm gonna get some blueberry pie Oreo."
34:38;34:39;"Maybe."
34:39;34:43;"If I need a hit, man, if I'm fiending for a thing."
34:43;34:46;">> If there's no farmer's market where you can get a fresh baked blueberry pie to"
34:46;34:47;"bring home on Sunday."
34:47;34:49;">> Farmer's market."
36:29;36:48;">> What are those Newtons?"
36:48;36:49;">> Those are just fig Newtons."
36:49;36:50;">> Those are just regular fig Newtons."
36:50;36:52;">> What's your take on fig Newtons?"
36:52;36:54;">> The illusion of health in a cookie?"
36:54;36:54;">> The illusion of health."
36:54;36:56;">> The illusion because fig- >> Yeah, they're probably not healthy."
36:56;36:59;">> Yeah, of course not, but fig sounds biblical."
36:59;37:00;">> It's got fiber."
37:00;37:01;">> Right."
37:01;37:02;">> Yeah."
37:02;37:02;">> You actually- >> Yeah."
37:02;37:04;">> [LAUGH]"
37:04;37:06;">> I can definitely speak for myself, and"
37:06;37:10;"I grew up with relatively, my parents wanted to eat organic and stuff."
37:10;37:17;"I probably had 1 to 2,000 fig Newtons in my life before I ever saw a fig."
37:17;37:17;">> Yeah, yeah."
37:17;37:18;">> Sure."
37:18;37:19;">> I ate my first fig last year."
37:19;37:20;">> Really?"
37:20;37:21;">> Yeah, yeah."
37:21;37:23;"And someone gave it to me as a gift at Hopewood."
37:23;37:27;"It's like he could see the inner city youth in my eyes and was just like,"
37:27;37:30;"here son, this is the real version of it."
37:30;37:32;">> A fresh fig is very good."
37:32;37:34;">> Yeah, I mean Jesus was all about it in the Bible."
37:34;37:35;">> That's right."
37:35;37:38;">> The thing is with fig, there has to be, you said there's fiber,"
37:38;37:42;"there has to be a good and bad version of fiber."
37:42;37:47;"There has to be a healthy Gala apple version of fiber, and"
37:47;37:50;"then there's the captive pollution version."
37:50;37:54;"It's like one eases through your system, one completely disrupts and"
37:54;37:56;"destroys everything in its wake."
37:56;37:59;"And that's that version of fiber, it's just a path of destruction."
37:59;38:05;">> I think it's the same way that they started selling Doritos and"
38:05;38:07;"being like, three grams of protein."
38:07;38:12;"Whatever people got obsessed with, fiber, protein, omega-3s,"
38:12;38:16;"they could just look at the thing and be like, our disgusting thing has a tiny bit"
38:16;38:17;"of fiber, tiny bit of protein."
38:17;38:19;"You just flip it and you market it, and then-"
38:19;38:20;">> Kale."
38:20;38:22;">> We know there's some kale."
38:22;38:22;">> But that's what I'm saying."
38:22;38:24;">> Can you see kale Doritos?"
38:24;38:25;">> [LAUGH]"
38:25;38:27;">> Yo, how does that not exist?"
38:27;38:29;">> My God, because those are two different audiences."
38:29;38:30;">> Different demographics, right, yeah."
38:30;38:31;">> Two completely different audiences."
38:31;38:34;"But it is like, the fiber in an apple is like a,"
38:34;38:38;"it passes things through your system the way someone crowd surfs."
38:38;38:40;"It's just a very delicate, let's move them along."
38:40;38:43;"And then the fiber in a fig newton is a bullet."
38:43;38:44;">> Right, right."
38:44;38:47;">> You could shoot through an intestine."
38:47;38:49;">> There's fiber in a seven layer burrito from Taco Bell."
38:49;38:50;">> Yeah. >> For sure."
38:50;38:51;">> Yeah. >> And protein."
38:51;38:53;">> And that's gonna pass right through."
38:53;38:54;">> Yeah, it's gonna pass through."
38:54;38:55;">> Yeah."
38:55;38:57;">> There's protein in a birthday cake Oreo."
38:57;38:59;">> Wow, birthday cake."
38:59;38:59;"Think about that."
38:59;39:01;">> There's less- >> So not really."
39:01;39:01;">> Think about that."
39:01;39:03;">> I'm looking at the less than one gram."
39:03;39:04;">> Take a sec."
39:04;39:06;">> Take a second though."
39:06;39:12;"And a darker thought, think of who eats birthday cake Oreos on their birthday."
39:12;39:13;">> That's rough."
39:13;39:14;">> No. >> That's a rough birthday."
39:14;39:15;">> You know, it's like we've talked about-"
39:15;39:17;">> It's like how was the divorce?"
39:17;39:19;">> [LAUGH]"
39:19;39:19;">> God, you know-"
39:19;39:21;">> Have you seen your children?"
39:21;39:26;">> We've painted a lot of dark pictures of the kind of horrific, unequal,"
39:26;39:30;"brutal, capitalistic American society in our cookie episode."
39:30;39:36;"But I didn't actually get depressed until you painted the picture of the solo"
39:36;39:41;"person at the supermarket getting whatever they're gonna eat for dinner."
39:41;39:43;"And then just be like, well, it is my birthday."
39:43;39:44;">> [LAUGH]"
39:44;39:45;">> And just grabbing them."
39:45;39:51;"Like, everything else was already just kind of rough, but that really gets me."
39:51;39:52;">> It's heavy."
39:52;39:54;">> That's like, Paul Giamatti plays that role."
39:54;39:55;">> Yeah."
39:55;39:57;">> Yeah. >> In the Alexander Payne film."
39:57;39:57;">> Yeah."
39:57;40:01;">> My God, only he could just with his eyes convey the lost,"
40:01;40:04;"hopeless emotion that one would reach for Oreo."
40:04;40:06;">> Yeah, he's just looking back and forth between the regular and"
40:06;40:08;"the birthday cake, or he just buys both."
40:08;40:09;">> Yeah, buys both."
40:09;40:09;">> Checks out."
40:09;40:12;">> This is for my birthday and these are for tomorrow."
40:12;40:16;">> That reminds me a similar lesson I learned about"
40:16;40:20;"corporate food products and depression."
40:20;40:22;"When I was a kid- >> I have this memory-"
40:22;40:23;">> That sounds like a course."
40:23;40:27;"That sounds like a course at- >> Yeah, I'm at UCLA."
40:27;40:29;">> Yeah, UCLA, corporate food products and depression."
40:29;40:31;">> And depression in the Western literary tradition."
40:31;40:33;">> It's like a pamphlet in your therapist's office."
40:33;40:35;">> [LAUGH] >> They're closer than you think."
40:35;40:41;">> I have this memory of on Thanksgiving Day, the supermarkets open and"
40:41;40:43;"maybe rolling with my dad."
40:43;40:45;"Mom was like, we need some more potatoes or something."
40:45;40:46;">> Yeah. >> And just being there and"
40:46;40:49;"just seeing at a local Domino's."
40:49;40:51;"The Domino's used to sometimes make sandwiches."
40:51;40:54;"I don't know if it was a unique chain thing."
40:54;40:58;"But I just remember walking past the Domino's on Thanksgiving Day,"
40:58;40:59;"seeing some people inside it."
40:59;41:02;"And already being whatever I was, 10, 11, 12, just being like,"
41:02;41:04;"I guess some people go to Domino's on Thanksgiving."
41:04;41:08;"I guess, yeah, well, I guess not everybody has a family or something."
41:08;41:13;"And then seeing a sign that was Domino's Thanksgiving special,"
41:13;41:16;"turkey sub, and one liter soda."
41:16;41:19;"I just remember as a kid being like, just again,"
41:19;41:22;"having that same picture of it's a special occasion."
41:22;41:27;"But you're just paying this kind of weak homage to it."
41:27;41:31;">> That special should also come with a card apologizing for"
41:31;41:33;"the fire that destroyed your family."
41:33;41:34;">> Yeah."
41:34;41:34;">> [LAUGH]"
44:03;44:07;">> Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
44:07;44:10;">> I do wonder, what does Jason Bourne do on Thanksgiving?"
44:10;44:11;">> [LAUGH]"
44:11;44:12;">> That's a good question."
44:12;44:17;">> What does he do up, cuz he is, the realistic version of the Bourne identity"
44:17;44:22;"is him alone on Thanksgiving at that Domino's."
44:22;44:23;">> Or in Prague."
44:23;44:25;">> Or in Prague, but he's at Domino's."
44:25;44:27;"He's in Thailand, cuz it's not fun."
44:27;44:29;"He's literally always running."
44:29;44:30;">> Yeah."
44:30;44:33;">> Being in another country is kind of glamorous, I guess."
44:33;44:35;"Like, Happy Thanksgiving, Jason."
44:35;44:37;"He's like, didn't even notice."
44:37;44:42;"That's, but yeah, like, like the dude with like the Donnie Brosco,"
44:42;44:43;"the undercover cop."
44:43;44:44;">> Yeah."
44:44;44:46;">> Who just like, by himself, I don't know."
44:46;44:50;">> By himself, just eating Thanksgiving Oreos."
44:50;44:51;">> We gotta, yeah."
44:51;44:52;">> Pumpkin Oreos."
44:52;44:52;">> There's a lot of."
44:52;44:56;">> And, and, and we think for a second, we think for a second that's not a thing."
44:56;44:58;">> Time Crisis got dark again, man."
44:58;44:59;">> Yeah."
44:59;45:00;">> I really feel. >> Existential."
45:00;45:05;">> I do think it's a public health thing that we gotta take more care of lonely"
45:05;45:06;"people."
45:06;45:08;">> Yeah, the Eleanor Rigby's of the world deserve."
45:08;45:09;">> Exactly, exactly."
45:09;45:10;">> More than."
45:10;45:13;">> If I was president, Eleanor Rigby initiative."
45:13;45:15;">> Yeah. >> I truly think you gotta fight poverty."
45:15;45:16;"You also gotta fight loneliness."
45:16;45:18;"You gotta give people a reason to live."
45:18;45:19;"Just surviving."
45:19;45:22;">> There should be a speed dating version of Thanksgiving dinner, though."
45:22;45:24;"Like a, like a blind."
45:24;45:25;">> That's a great idea, actually."
45:25;45:26;">> Yeah."
45:26;45:30;">> The unfortunate go to shelters, the people with families go there, and, and"
45:30;45:32;"the lonely people go to the speed dating."
45:32;45:34;">> We're not talking about people who have been like stricken,"
45:34;45:36;"like the house burned down, lost their job."
45:36;45:37;">> Yeah, yeah. >> We're just talking about people who"
45:37;45:40;"maybe are fine, lower middle class people."
45:40;45:41;"They just don't know anybody."
45:41;45:43;">> Yeah. >> Those people should get to have a sense"
45:43;45:44;"of community too."
45:44;45:45;">> I could totally see it."
45:45;45:47;"Maybe this is just me accepting being an adult."
45:47;45:52;"I could totally see a world where you look up and you just don't have any friends."
45:52;45:55;"Where you've just been working and you just look up and like, no real friends."
45:55;45:59;"But you have people you know, but you, I could see a world where you just like,"
45:59;46:00;"life swept you away."
46:00;46:03;">> I mean, how many people have children primarily just to avoid that?"
46:03;46:05;">> Yeah, I think that's the point of like marriage."
46:05;46:10;"Like, the fear of loneliness, I think, is the number one cause of marriage."
46:10;46:12;"I'm saying like it's an illness, but."
46:12;46:14;"[LAUGH]"
46:14;46:17;">> The number one cause of marriage cancer is loneliness."
46:17;46:20;">> So, Obama, you start the Eleanor Rigby initiative."
46:20;46:21;"We could get those marriage numbers down."
46:21;46:23;">> We can get marriage numbers way down."
46:23;46:27;">> Cuz divorce is up because most people realize that marriage is a mistake."
46:27;46:31;"But at the same time, it's like you wouldn't need to even do it if you,"
46:31;46:33;"if you weren't so terrified."
46:33;46:34;">> I think marriage numbers are down."
46:34;46:36;">> Are they? >> I remember hearing somewhere like, for"
46:36;46:41;"the first time ever in history, over 50% of the population was single."
46:41;46:42;">> Wow. >> Isn't that crazy?"
46:42;46:43;">> That's interesting."
46:43;46:45;">> Are people still pairing off though?"
46:45;46:45;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
46:45;46:48;"It meant like, maritally, like technically single."
46:48;46:50;"Like at my tax return, it's single still."
46:50;46:52;">> Yeah. >> Even though I'm not single."
46:52;46:53;">> You have a long term girlfriend."
46:53;46:54;">> Yeah. >> You have somebody to do"
46:54;46:55;"Thanksgiving with."
46:55;46:57;">> Yeah."
46:57;46:59;">> All right. >> Quit bragging."
46:59;47:00;">> You, show off."
47:50;48:04;">> You know what helps though?"
48:04;48:06;"I think phones probably contribute to that too,"
48:06;48:10;"because I was at lunch the other day with a friend of mine."
48:10;48:15;"And then he left the table for a little while and my battery died on my phone."
48:15;48:18;"And I was just alone in a restaurant."
48:18;48:20;"Cuz now, like, think about 20 years ago."
48:20;48:24;"Like 20 years ago, you were just alone in a restaurant."
48:24;48:28;"Like now, your phone, you're never really alone."
48:28;48:31;"You at least have the illusion of being connected and around people."
48:31;48:33;"But like, he left and my battery's dead."
48:33;48:34;"And I was like, I'm just."
48:34;48:36;">> Did you pretend to look at your phone so people wouldn't know?"
48:36;48:37;">> No, I was a."
48:37;48:38;">> What did you do? >> I was just crazy,"
48:38;48:39;"cuz we were done eating."
48:39;48:43;"So I was just, you don't know what to do with your eyes."
48:43;48:44;">> Yeah."
48:44;48:47;">> Where do you focus this, like you don't know what to do with your eye."
48:47;48:49;"And it was my first time noticing the restaurant."
48:49;48:51;"I was very Eckhart Tolle in the moment."
48:51;48:52;"I was right there."
48:52;48:54;">> But was it a positive feeling?"
48:54;48:57;"You looked around and you were just like, life's beautiful."
48:57;49:01;">> Every stage of emotion that you could imagine, like it was complete fear and"
49:01;49:02;"anxiety."
49:02;49:03;"There was denial."
49:03;49:03;"There, no, no, no, no."
49:03;49:06;"There was denial where I kept trying to turn my phone on."
49:06;49:08;"There was like, he didn't go to the bathroom."
49:08;49:09;"He's back any second."
49:09;49:11;"Like there's denial, there's fear."
49:11;49:14;"There's all of these emotions that just run through you."
49:14;49:19;"And then there's acceptance of like, I am alone at this table."
49:19;49:20;"And here we are, look at the architecture."
49:20;49:23;">> Before we get into the summer songs, because I love this conversation and"
49:23;49:28;"I love that it's all stemming from the limited edition blueberry pie Oreos."
49:28;49:28;"Check them out."
49:28;49:31;">> [LAUGH] >> This is a question I always think that,"
49:31;49:34;"we've probably talked about this on Tom Crisis before, maybe we haven't."
49:34;49:39;"How many times have you eaten dinner at a restaurant by yourself?"
49:39;49:42;">> I probably do it more often than the average person because"
49:42;49:45;"I'm like out of town on the road a lot."
49:45;49:47;">> Define restaurant."
49:47;49:49;"It's like a taqueria."
49:49;49:50;">> No, like- >> With fluorescent light."
49:50;49:51;">> No, I'm talking- >> Okay, like a restaurant."
49:51;49:52;">> I'm talking with waiter service."
49:52;49:54;">> Waiter service, where you're not just at the bar, cuz at the bar-"
49:54;49:55;">> Like how can I help you?"
49:55;49:57;"Table for one."
49:57;49:59;">> Yeah. >> Okay, your server will be right with you."
49:59;49:59;">> Okay."
49:59;50:03;">> There's always a moment where they squint and they go, just you?"
50:03;50:05;">> Right. >> And it's with concern."
50:05;50:06;"It's with slight concern."
50:06;50:08;">> I know, our society doesn't take care of lonely people."
50:08;50:12;">> I do it, if I'm in a town that doesn't have Postmates."
50:12;50:14;">> [LAUGH] >> You know what I mean?"
50:14;50:18;"And I actually want a meal, then I'll go to a restaurant and I'll sit there."
50:18;50:24;"And again, with a phone you can do emails and stuff like that, but even-"
50:24;50:27;">> I almost feel like that, okay, but in your hometown."
50:27;50:33;">> The true gauge of who your true friends are and how you feel about someone is"
50:33;50:36;"when you're scrambling to look for someone to eat with."
50:36;50:41;"That's the truest gauge, and you just go down the list."
50:41;50:45;"And then you go by area, I'm here, if you have a weird amount of time and"
50:45;50:48;"not enough time to go home, and then you're just looking for someone to eat with."
50:48;50:49;"And it's just like, who?"
50:49;50:53;">> Cuz there's some people that you actually get to and you're like,"
50:53;50:54;"I wouldn't even wanna eat with you."
50:54;50:58;">> Yeah, but maybe it's easy, the worst."
50:58;50:59;">> Right. >> Let's see at lunch."
50:59;51:01;">> Man, this made me think about in college."
51:01;51:02;">> Yeah? >> That's a weird one."
51:02;51:05;"When you first get to college and you gotta go eat, and it's like-"
51:05;51:08;">> The tray?"
51:08;51:10;">> Holding the tray and just being like- >> Is it really like that?"
51:10;51:13;"Like when you just walk in and- >> Yeah, at Columbia,"
51:13;51:17;"it was like a beautiful, almost like Hogwarts style dining hall."
51:17;51:20;"And you just kinda roll in and you see people laughing."
51:20;51:22;"It literally was like in a high school."
51:22;51:25;"It didn't happen in high school to me cuz we went to this small school."
51:25;51:26;"I had my friends."
51:26;51:29;"But then at college, sometimes you look around and you're like,"
51:29;51:31;"it really didn't come naturally to me."
51:31;51:33;"I was like, wait, am I literally, I'm talking about the first week."
51:33;51:35;"It's like, you look around, you see some people,"
51:35;51:37;"look like they're having a great time."
51:37;51:39;"And you're like, I don't know the middle."
51:39;51:41;"And then you look around, you're like, don't see your roommate,"
51:41;51:43;"don't see your handful of people."
51:43;51:47;"And you're like, that guy's in my seminar."
51:47;51:51;"Am I literally gonna just sit down and be like, hey man,"
51:51;51:53;"we're in Professor whatever's class together."
51:53;51:55;">> Mm-hm."
51:55;51:57;">> Yeah, how's it going?"
51:57;51:58;"Good?"
51:58;52:02;"The only group that actually does that are celebrities."
52:02;52:04;"Celebrities will do that to each other."
52:04;52:06;"I like watching, my favorite thing-"
52:06;52:07;">> When they've never met before?"
52:07;52:10;">> When they've never met before, I like to imagine a conversation starting."
52:10;52:13;"It's like, hey, you don't film in television?"
52:13;52:15;"I do film in television."
52:15;52:19;"And it's just like an immediate kind of trust in a room full of whatever."
52:19;52:25;"I've seen it happen so many times, just like the only two known people"
52:25;52:27;"in a room just find each other."
52:27;52:28;">> Yeah. >> It's just like,"
52:28;52:31;"because there's at least that to connect with."
52:31;52:34;"But you should be able to do it, it's just like with anything."
52:34;52:36;">> Regular people should do that too."
52:36;52:36;">> Yeah."
55:16;55:20;">> It's like you just talk to a stranger."
55:20;55:23;"People just walk, just approach the stranger."
55:23;55:28;">> No, it's a controversial topic because some people find it invasive if a stranger"
55:28;55:30;"comes and talks to them."
55:30;55:32;"I mean, we live in a scary world, so"
55:32;55:36;"some people would be saying hi to somebody you don't know is aggressive."
55:36;55:36;">> That's the whole point."
55:36;55:39;"Your morning should be spent, and"
55:39;55:43;"it essentially is making yourself presentable to strangers."
55:43;55:46;"Like this is the reason you put on your jacket and you comb your hair and"
55:46;55:47;"then you go."
55:47;55:52;"So if I have to approach a stranger today, they will not be completely freaked out."
55:52;55:56;"They will not be completely turned off and"
55:56;56:00;"disgusted by the notion that I would even say it to them."
56:00;56:03;">> But that's like a situation where it's like, so you dropped your scarf."
56:03;56:06;">> Yeah. >> Versus like at the coffee shop."
56:06;56:07;">> What's up?"
56:07;56:07;">> What's up?"
56:07;56:09;">> Yeah."
56:09;56:10;">> Man, you hear about John Galliano?"
56:10;56:12;">> I'm like, you didn't?"
56:12;56:14;"I don't know."
56:14;56:19;">> I'm jealous of babies when I see babies just stare at something."
56:19;56:20;">> Yeah. >> Cuz you wanna do that constantly."
56:20;56:23;"You always look for the excuse to look at someone or to stare at someone."
56:23;56:28;"But baby's just looking over its mother's shoulder and just staring at you."
56:28;56:30;"Just figuring out what is this face."
56:30;56:31;"Just learning."
56:31;56:35;"And I wish we could do, I wanna do that to people constantly."
56:35;56:39;"There's a girl in the next studio that I'm avoiding doing that to now."
56:39;56:40;"I just keep wanting to stare,"
56:40;56:43;"there's a girl in the Mickey Mouse sweatshirt that is stare-adable."
56:43;56:46;">> She's gonna feel weird if people are staring at her."
56:46;56:48;">> She should, she should, she should."
56:48;56:51;"And I shouldn't be, I'm staring at her now and I shouldn't be doing that."
56:51;56:53;">> We have a responsibility as humans and"
56:53;56:57;"especially as men to neutralize our gaze."
56:57;56:58;">> Yeah."
56:58;56:59;">> I don't know. >> Cuz you wanna be that guy."
56:59;57:00;"You wanna be that guy."
57:00;57:04;">> And sometimes it's as simple as just not leaving people alone."
57:04;57:04;">> Yeah."
57:04;57:11;">> Look, the loneliness deficit, it's not gonna get solved overnight."
57:11;57:15;">> You have to read this book, I just read this book called Tribe."
57:15;57:18;"It's an excellent book and it just talks about,"
57:18;57:23;"essentially our need to belong and how a lot of the things in our lives and"
57:23;57:28;"the things that we work for actually work against our innate need to belong."
57:28;57:30;"You know, like we used to- >> It's like a sociological type thing?"
57:30;57:34;">> Yeah, and how we were a part of tribes and everyone was kind of a part of tribe."
57:34;57:37;"And then the biggest change in history was the ability to"
57:37;57:42;"essentially be self-sufficient and accumulate things and belongings and"
57:42;57:46;"wealth because before, all of your belongings were things that could travel"
57:46;57:52;"with you, but now you kind of, we don't need people, although we need people."
57:52;57:53;">> Yeah. >> Especially in LA,"
57:53;57:56;"you could spend your entire week not really interacting with anybody."
57:56;58:00;"You could just live in isolation, but- >> Easily."
58:00;58:02;">> Easily, but you need people."
58:02;58:05;"And it actually speaks about why depression is so"
58:05;58:09;"high amongst wealthier people, because- >> You're more isolated."
58:09;58:11;">> Because you're more isolated, because you basically,"
58:11;58:15;"the more money you have, the more you cut out the need for others."
58:15;58:16;"You know what I mean?"
58:16;58:18;">> Especially if you're so rich you don't have to work."
58:18;58:19;"You literally don't see it."
58:19;58:22;">> You don't have to leave your home, and your home is nice."
58:22;58:24;"You have everything you need and want."
58:24;58:28;"The beautiful thing about living in a small apartment with a bunch of people is"
58:28;58:31;"that although it's frustrating and it's in these inconveniences,"
58:31;58:33;"it's also like, it's a human being."
58:33;58:34;"You can feed off of it."
58:34;58:35;">> Right, well, also, it's like earlier we were talking,"
58:35;58:37;"yeah, actually, that's maybe what Home Alone is about."
58:37;58:39;"Earlier we were talking about the film Home Alone, but"
58:39;58:42;"it literally is about the frustration of family."
58:42;58:43;">> Yeah. >> He's in this big,"
58:43;58:48;"noisy family, and some people look at that and be like, that's a beautiful thing."
58:48;58:50;"Bunch of kids running around."
58:50;58:52;"Yeah, whatever, you get in fights with your brother or sister, but"
58:52;58:56;"it's like a whole family is under one roof, traveling to Paris, France together."
58:56;59:01;"It's a beautiful, luxurious trip for a huge family to do."
59:01;59:02;"But he has all these frustrations with it, so"
59:02;59:05;"he wishes for the polar opposite, which is no family."
59:05;59:06;">> Yeah. >> And yeah,"
59:06;59:08;"he gets the cheese pizza for himself."
59:08;59:10;">> Yes. >> But ultimately, well,"
59:10;59:12;"he's a kid, so he's not gonna experience depression."
59:12;59:18;"So the depression and anxiety takes the form of the burglars infiltrating-"
59:18;59:19;">> Yeah."
59:19;59:20;">> His palace."
59:20;59:22;">> Ooh. >> And trying to kill him."
59:22;59:23;">> Interesting."
59:23;59:24;">> That's my take."
59:24;59:28;">> Well, Home Alone's also about accepting your family even though they're dicks."
59:28;59:31;">> Right. >> Cuz that was also the worst,"
59:31;59:32;"like the uncle and the brother."
59:32;59:33;">> And Buzz, Buzz is horrible."
59:33;59:36;">> And Buzz is just a horrible, horrible brother."
59:36;59:40;"But even at their worst, I mean, it speaks to what you're saying."
59:40;59:43;"Even at their worst, you still have that need."
59:43;59:45;">> Right, it's like you could be in another era,"
59:45;59:50;"the guy who was eating the turkey sub alone on Thanksgiving."
59:50;59:53;"Maybe there's something about this guy, nobody wants to pair off with him."
59:53;59:57;"He's not gonna get a husband or wife or children or anything."
59:57;01:00:01;"But even then, in a more tribal society,"
01:00:01;01:00:07;"village-based society, on the festival day, he would have been in the mix somewhere."
01:00:07;01:00:07;">> Yeah."
01:00:07;01:00:10;">> He might have even been this annoying dude that nobody liked him."
01:00:10;01:00:12;"He might have been the village idiot."
01:00:12;01:00:12;">> Yeah."
01:00:12;01:00:15;">> But he wouldn't have been at Domino's by himself."
01:00:15;01:00:17;">> No."
01:00:17;01:00:18;">> Cuz you- >> The teenager-"
01:00:18;01:00:19;">> Before you were a part of a group of-"
01:00:19;01:00:21;">> Happy Thanksgiving."
01:00:21;01:00:23;">> Thank you."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"There's not even tables at Domino's."
01:00:25;01:00:26;">> Yeah, it's not."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Domino's is heavy on the delivery."
01:00:28;01:00:30;">> Carry out only."
01:00:30;01:00:32;">> Heavy on the, not here."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Domino's slogan should just be not here."
01:00:35;01:00:35;">> Yeah."
01:00:35;01:00:37;">> [LAUGH]"
01:00:37;01:00:38;">> Maybe in the parking lot."
01:00:38;01:00:39;">> Take that, take that."
01:00:39;01:00:40;">> It's not here."
01:00:40;01:00:40;"Go home."
01:01:58;01:02:04;">> You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:02:04;01:02:06;">> I've got Jarad Carmichael in here."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"It's late August."
01:02:07;01:02:09;">> Yes. >> We gotta do the songs of the summer."
01:02:09;01:02:10;">> Songs of the summer."
01:02:10;01:02:14;">> So these are the top ten songs, according to Billboard, of this summer."
01:02:14;01:02:14;">> Okay."
01:02:14;01:02:17;">> It's finally deep enough in the summer that we can say unequivocally what the top"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"ten songs are, so we're gonna blaze through them."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Number ten, Kent Jones, don't mind."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"I don't know who Kent Jones is."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Does anybody?"
01:02:23;01:02:24;">> I feel like I know this song."
01:02:24;01:02:25;">> Kent, well here's the song."
01:02:31;01:02:31;">> DJ Mustard."
01:02:41;01:02:43;">> I call it the Konichiwa song."
01:02:53;01:03:01;">> I've never heard this in my life."
01:03:01;01:03:02;">> I'm gonna say- >> It's tight though."
01:03:02;01:03:05;">> The chords, the- >> Yeah?"
01:03:05;01:03:07;">> That's just beautiful."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Those are the chords that speak to me."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"You put that in there, that's a great, yeah, I like that song."
01:03:11;01:03:14;">> Yeah, it's got a tiny touch of jazz in some of the phrasings."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Yeah, it's beautiful."
01:03:15;01:03:17;">> Yeah, it's beautiful."
01:03:17;01:03:19;">> The number nine song, Fifth Harmony."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"This was a big one, Work From Home."
01:03:22;01:03:24;">> Work From Home?"
01:03:24;01:03:26;">> Yeah, well, cuz they couldn't call it work."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"You know why, Jake?"
01:03:27;01:03:28;">> Yep, I do."
01:03:28;01:03:30;">> Because of the number two song?"
01:03:30;01:03:30;">> Yeah."
01:03:30;01:03:32;">> Yeah."
01:03:32;01:03:35;">> There's a Tim Heidecker song off his new album called Work From Home."
01:03:35;01:03:35;">> Really?"
01:03:35;01:03:36;">> Yeah."
01:03:36;01:03:37;">> Maybe it's the same song."
01:03:37;01:03:38;">> No, it's not."
01:04:25;01:04:28;">> Now, since we're blazing through this, I just wanna point out one thing about"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"this song, Work From Home."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"You hear the beginning?"
01:04:32;01:04:33;">> Hear the beginning?"
01:04:33;01:04:33;">> Do it again."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"Cassie?"
01:04:35;01:04:37;">> Similar."
01:04:37;01:04:37;">> Hm."
01:04:37;01:04:43;">> It might remind you of a certain song."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"When I first heard it, I thought this."
01:04:44;01:04:45;">> Mm-hm."
01:04:45;01:04:46;">> That it kinda sounded like this song."
01:04:46;01:04:51;"And then I looked it up, and it turned out that either there was a lawsuit or"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"they just reached out, and they had to pay this guy for this song."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Remember this one by Daniel Bedingfield?"
01:04:57;01:04:59;">> No."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"What year is this from?"
01:05:02;01:05:05;">> Mm, early 2000s?"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"2002."
01:05:07;01:05:08;">> Yeah, actually."
01:05:08;01:05:09;">> I mean, there's a lawsuit over this."
01:05:09;01:05:12;">> Well, not a law, they gave him publishing."
01:05:12;01:05:14;">> That's pushing it."
01:05:20;01:05:21;">> Wow."
01:05:21;01:05:22;">> Was it the other one?"
01:05:28;01:05:29;">> What Jerry?"
01:05:29;01:05:31;">> You think they deserve to give, he deserve publishing?"
01:05:31;01:05:33;">> No, no. >> Jarrod, you think they deserve publishing?"
01:05:33;01:05:34;">> No, I think that's different enough."
01:05:34;01:05:35;">> Do you?"
01:05:35;01:05:39;">> It's a crazy time, everybody's suing everybody."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Ed Sheeran's getting sued- >> It's so dumb."
01:05:40;01:05:43;">> For his song that kinda sounds like Let's Get It On."
01:05:43;01:05:44;">> Wait, who is?"
01:05:44;01:05:44;">> Ed Sheeran."
01:05:44;01:05:45;">> What's the song?"
01:05:45;01:05:45;">> He has that song."
01:05:45;01:05:46;">> The Marvin Gaye song?"
01:05:46;01:05:49;">> When your legs don't look and your memory fades."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"It has the same groove."
01:05:50;01:05:51;">> Mm-hm."
01:05:51;01:05:53;">> I don't wanna get into it, it's stressful, man."
01:05:53;01:05:57;"The number eight song this summer is by 21 Pilots."
01:05:57;01:05:57;">> This band."
01:05:57;01:05:59;">> They're probably the only band on the list."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"It's called Ride."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"Have you heard of this, Jarrod?"
01:06:03;01:06:05;">> I don't think so, actually."
01:06:15;01:06:20;">> Oh, I have."
01:06:30;01:06:33;">> Kind of like- >> Yeah, yeah, I have heard that song."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"Do I just not know artists' names anymore?"
01:06:36;01:06:39;">> Yeah, I think that's what happens as we grow older."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's like, oh, it's that song."
01:06:40;01:06:44;">> Yeah, how many singles before you know a name?"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Desiigner, I learned really fast."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"Like, Desiigner became, was it just a media-"
01:06:48;01:06:49;">> Yes."
01:06:49;01:06:51;">> That extra I really did work."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"You see it once and you're like, yeah, I will never forget this."
01:06:54;01:06:55;">> Imagine if it was only one I."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"For some reason, it's really funny, just Desiigner."
01:06:57;01:06:59;">> Desiigner, yeah."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"No, no, no, not Desiigner, Desiigner."
01:07:01;01:07:02;">> Just Desiigner."
01:07:02;01:07:03;">> Just Desiigner."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"One I."
01:07:04;01:07:07;">> The number seven song is Rihanna."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"You might not have known exactly who Rihanna was until at least two or"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"three singles deep early in her career."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Song's called Needed Me."
01:07:14;01:07:15;">> Yeah."
01:07:15;01:07:17;">> This might be one of the coolest songs on the list."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Very vibing."
01:07:20;01:07:21;">> I don't know if I know this one."
01:07:21;01:07:24;">> Was this in the South 5s?"
01:07:24;01:07:28;">> I have a feeling for a lot of people, this is the Savage song."
01:07:28;01:07:28;">> Yeah."
01:07:32;01:07:33;">> This is such a great song."
01:07:43;01:07:46;">> This is definitely a song for the dog days of summer."
01:07:46;01:07:46;">> Yeah."
01:07:47;01:07:49;">> Mid August."
01:07:49;01:07:50;">> This whole album though."
01:07:50;01:07:51;">> Yeah, great album."
01:08:11;01:08:28;">> She is able to pull off a bravado typically reserved for male artists."
01:08:28;01:08:29;">> Right, and she kills it."
01:08:29;01:08:31;">> She has a confidence that, you know what I mean?"
01:08:31;01:08:32;">> I better have my money."
01:08:32;01:08:34;">> A monegetic confidence that's-"
01:08:34;01:08:37;">> And just she has one of the great unique voices."
01:08:37;01:08:38;">> Absolutely."
01:08:38;01:08:39;">> Everybody knows she has a great voice, but"
01:08:39;01:08:44;"that's actually an incredibly difficult chorus for anybody to sing."
01:08:44;01:08:48;">> Yeah, because it could easily just be too drawn out and"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"most people would sound horrible singing that."
01:08:50;01:08:51;">> I can't sing like that."
01:08:51;01:08:52;">> Yeah."
01:08:52;01:08:53;">> I'm not even going to try."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Sometimes I try to sing."
01:08:54;01:08:55;">> Yeah, but I'm doing it in my head."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"I'm doing it in my head and I'm failing, so you know."
01:08:57;01:09:00;">> I think I was in consideration of that album."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"It was probably one of my favorite songs."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"I play that song like, that's my walking through airport song."
01:09:05;01:09:07;">> One of the great albums of the year, certainly."
01:09:07;01:09:08;">> Yeah, absolutely."
01:09:08;01:09:12;">> Number six, Sia, featuring Sean Paul, Cheap Thrills."
01:10:02;01:10:21;">> You know, this one, Sia's an incredible singer, writer."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"Sean Paul, one of the all time greats."
01:10:23;01:10:27;"I think the reason I've found it hard this summer to get into this song,"
01:10:27;01:10:28;"it's very well crafted."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"It's not a bad song."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"But it's just like, I feel the mechanism too much."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"It's hard to describe."
01:10:35;01:10:37;">> This is interesting, you saying this."
01:10:37;01:10:38;">> I know, I know, cuz normally I don't care."
01:10:38;01:10:44;"But it's like, I feel like I see the same way that a Big Mac is just a great"
01:10:44;01:10:48;"sandwich, but then what were we talking about, the Arch Deluxe?"
01:10:48;01:10:50;">> Yeah, you're just like, no, no, you're trying to make a hit."
01:10:50;01:10:50;">> Yes."
01:10:50;01:10:51;">> Yeah, exactly."
01:10:51;01:10:55;">> And it's hard, it's difficult for someone, I'd imagine, like Sia."
01:10:55;01:10:58;"Same thing with like, you take like Diane Warren, right?"
01:10:58;01:11:03;"Where it's like, it's hard to not be, when you're that good at making songs that"
01:11:03;01:11:08;"are so insanely popular, but you're that good at the, I wouldn't even say formula,"
01:11:08;01:11:13;"cuz I really love, I like Reaper by Sia, I think it's just like a great,"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"just this beautiful song."
01:11:14;01:11:15;">> And she doesn't strike out."
01:11:15;01:11:19;">> Every now and then it's just gonna be a bit on the nose of like,"
01:11:19;01:11:23;"when the bar is really high, yeah, the bar is really high, it's like,"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"your hits are transcendent, and"
01:11:24;01:11:28;"then your misses are just very well crafted pop songs."
01:11:28;01:11:29;">> Yes."
01:11:49;01:11:54;">> So our producer just told us that the opening lines, come on, come on,"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"turn the radio on, Sia recorded a version for"
01:11:57;01:12:02;"almost every city in the country for wherever radio station."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"Then come on, come on, turn Kiss FM on."
01:12:05;01:12:07;">> Wow. >> Come on, come on, turn."
01:12:07;01:12:08;">> Tulsa Z100 on."
01:12:08;01:12:09;">> Tulsa Z100 on."
01:12:09;01:12:10;">> Wow."
01:12:10;01:12:13;">> So yeah, it's like a song that's made, you know what it's like,"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"sometimes you hear a song, you're like, that's made for the radio."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"And then other times you hear a song, you're like, that's made,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"that was made for the radio."
01:12:20;01:12:24;">> She also did Celebrity, right, because she's crazy famous, but"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"you wouldn't recognize her without the bangs."
01:12:26;01:12:27;">> Yeah, brilliant."
01:12:27;01:12:28;">> I wouldn't, I don't know what Sia looks like without the bangs."
01:12:28;01:12:30;">> She throws on a trucker hat."
01:12:30;01:12:32;">> Yeah, then who, like who?"
01:12:32;01:12:33;">> Yeah."
01:12:33;01:12:35;">> I would ask Sia, have you heard of Sia?"
01:12:35;01:12:36;">> Right, no idea."
01:12:36;01:12:38;">> Good for her."
01:12:38;01:12:42;"Number five, the aforementioned Designer."
01:12:42;01:12:43;">> Yes."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"Who's Designer?"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"I don't even know who Designer is."
01:12:45;01:12:46;">> You know this song, Panda, right?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;">> Panda."
01:12:48;01:12:49;">> He's from Brooklyn."
01:12:49;01:12:50;">> Vaguely."
01:12:50;01:12:54;">> I love the fact that came out after the song came out that he'd never been to Atlanta."
01:12:54;01:12:55;">> Oh, really?"
01:12:55;01:12:56;">> Talk about creativity."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"He's got, I thought he had broads then."
01:12:59;01:13:01;">> Maybe he's been, I'm sure he's been to Atlanta at this point, but"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"when he made this song, he's young."
01:13:03;01:13:04;">> Yeah, he's like 19, right?"
01:13:04;01:13:06;">> Yeah, yeah, he'd never been to Atlanta."
01:13:06;01:13:08;">> I love that."
01:14:15;01:14:17;">> This is a hot song twice."
01:14:17;01:14:21;"On Pablo and then again as its own thing."
01:14:21;01:14:24;">> Yeah, it's hard for me to associate this song too much with this summer."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"I feel like the song's been out forever."
01:14:25;01:14:28;">> Yeah, but I think we heard it so much for-"
01:14:28;01:14:31;">> Who doesn't like that song?"
01:14:31;01:14:33;">> He's just being a shout."
01:14:33;01:14:33;"[SOUND]"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"[LAUGH]"
01:14:35;01:14:37;">> I don't think he's gonna be a one hit wonder."
01:14:37;01:14:38;">> Timmy Turner?"
01:14:38;01:14:39;">> Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:14:39;01:14:45;">> I think the single's really good, but was it XXL Mag, the echoey version of it?"
01:14:45;01:14:47;">> The freshmen, yeah, yeah."
01:14:47;01:14:51;">> I like that version, the acapella version so much."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"And I was hoping the single version would be layered."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"You know like the Sylvan Esso, Hey Mommy, where it's just like this."
01:14:57;01:15:01;"The acapella that gets layered and progressively gets bigger."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I was hoping it was gonna be like that, but I mean, he's great."
01:15:04;01:15:06;">> Don't be afraid of minimalism, people."
01:15:06;01:15:07;">> Yeah, do what you want."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Make songs that look like the Apple Store."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"[LAUGH]"
01:15:11;01:15:13;">> Number four, Calvin Harris featuring Rihanna."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"We've heard this a lot this summer."
01:15:22;01:15:24;">> Secretly co-written by Taylor Swift."
01:15:24;01:15:26;">> Yeah, that's right, that was the whole thing."
01:15:32;01:15:33;">> Maybe least favorite so far."
01:15:33;01:15:34;">> Really?"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"But you haven't even heard the drop yet."
01:16:16;01:16:21;">> It's funny cuz Rihanna does both because that's one of those songs where if I'm being honest,"
01:16:21;01:16:26;"just as a guy, I'm a little self-conscious pulling up at a light, just blasting it."
01:16:26;01:16:27;">> Blasting that one."
01:16:27;01:16:28;">> And I felt that's not even a personal-"
01:16:28;01:16:29;">> But not needed me."
01:16:29;01:16:30;">> Not needed me."
01:16:30;01:16:31;">> Yeah, needed me is fine."
01:16:31;01:16:37;">> And I also felt that way about We Found Love, you know like a few years ago, that song."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Love that song."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"Also, that's like a, in the privacy of your home."
01:16:42;01:16:43;">> Kind of a better song."
01:16:43;01:16:44;">> Yeah, yeah."
01:16:44;01:16:46;">> Maybe there's like a similar feeling there."
01:16:46;01:16:51;">> Also, we just talked about how great her voice is, and we like it as pure as, you know."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I don't want Rihanna's voice stepped on."
01:16:53;01:16:57;">> Right, that's really stepped on."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"By the time it got to the marketplace."
01:16:59;01:17:01;">> It was just like altered, you know what I mean?"
01:17:01;01:17:02;"It was just like, I just like her voice."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I like her."
01:17:04;01:17:10;">> That's why you gotta listen to it ten times to get even close to the feeling of listening to Needed Me once."
01:17:10;01:17:12;">> Get the Rihanna hit that you're looking for."
01:17:12;01:17:16;">> Number three, I did hear this song a lot this summer."
01:17:16;01:17:19;"The Chainsmokers killing the radio right now."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"Don't Let Me Down."
01:17:20;01:17:21;">> Oh yeah."
01:17:21;01:17:26;">> A.K.A. the XX Go Pop."
01:17:26;01:17:28;">> Is this about the one with the mattress and Boulder?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;">> Same people, but different song."
01:17:30;01:17:31;">> Different song?"
01:17:31;01:17:32;">> Yeah."
01:17:32;01:17:55;"[ Music ]"
01:17:55;01:18:05;"[ Music ]"

01:18:36;01:18:38;">> Is that hot right now?"
01:18:38;01:18:42;"I've never actually taken Vicodin when I wasn't in pain."
01:18:42;01:18:44;"That's the one that really gets you, right?"
01:18:44;01:18:45;">> Yeah."
01:18:45;01:18:49;"I've never taken it without in pain either, but the feeling's still there."
01:18:49;01:18:55;"[ Music ]"
01:18:55;01:18:56;">> Building."
01:18:56;01:18:57;">> Yes."
01:18:57;01:18:58;">> Take us there."
01:18:58;01:18:59;">> Yes."
01:18:59;01:19:00;">> Up the octave."
01:19:01;01:19:07;">> And here comes the drop."
01:19:07;01:19:08;">> Oh, light switch."
01:19:08;01:19:12;"The light switched in the club."
01:19:12;01:19:15;">> This feels so much more like that -- how the sausages made one you're talking about."
01:19:15;01:19:16;">> Really?"
01:19:16;01:19:18;">> The drop -- you can feel the drop."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"But I'm not going to lie."

01:29:50;01:29:52;">> Thank you so much for joining us."
01:29:52;01:29:53;">> Thanks for having me."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"This is fun."
01:29:54;01:29:58;">> One of the best comedians and actors in the game right now, Gerard Carmichael."
01:29:58;01:30:00;">> Guys, thank you very much."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"That's when the applause sound effect was supposed to come."
01:30:02;01:30:03;">> Oh, yeah."
01:30:03;01:30:04;">> We're going to add it in post."
01:30:04;01:30:06;">> Put in the applause sound effect now."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"[ Laughter ]"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"All right."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"We'll see you soon."

01:30:36;01:30:46;"[ Music ]"
01:34:06;01:34:08;">> Let's get into our back to school countdown."
01:34:08;01:34:14;">> It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:34:14;01:34:22;">> So we're going to compare the top five CMJ, which is the college radio, to the top five iTunes songs."
01:34:22;01:34:28;">> And we're going to compare that radio kit, which I know you and I can both relate to, to a broader section."
01:34:28;01:34:36;"So the number five song on the CMJ charts this week is called ""Kid Kuma"" and it's by Fog."
01:34:36;01:34:37;">> Fog?"
01:34:37;01:34:38;">> F-O-G."
01:34:38;01:34:47;">> So how is this chart compiled exactly?"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Is it college radio stations?"
01:34:49;01:34:52;">> It's a chart that's compiled based on CMJ, what they've been playing."
01:34:52;01:34:53;">> What they've been playing."
01:34:53;01:34:54;">> Got you."
01:34:54;01:35:01;"[ Music ]"
01:35:01;01:35:03;">> Very lyrical and poetic."
01:35:03;01:35:08;"[ Music ]"
01:35:08;01:35:10;">> I'm not familiar with Fog."
01:35:10;01:35:12;">> Sucker punch by a meth head."
01:35:12;01:35:16;">> What does it remind you of, aside from getting sucker -- does it make you think of like the Eels?"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"Eels, remember them?"
01:35:17;01:35:18;">> Yeah, sure."
01:35:18;01:35:19;">> What's the Eels vibe?"
01:35:19;01:35:21;">> I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Wait, okay, here's a challenge."
01:35:22;01:35:23;">> Yeah?"
01:35:23;01:35:27;">> As we talk about the CMJ stuff, let's make a rule to not reference other bands."
01:35:27;01:35:28;">> Okay."
01:35:28;01:35:34;">> Because I feel like contemporary music is just sort of like, oh, it's one part television, one part Eels."
01:35:34;01:35:36;">> You mean contemporary like indie music?"
01:35:36;01:35:37;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"This might be impossible."
01:35:38;01:35:39;"We might not have anything to say."
01:35:39;01:35:42;">> Well, actually, okay, let's listen to Fog a little bit more."
01:35:42;01:35:56;"[ Music ]"
01:35:56;01:36:00;">> Well, the beats, the brown, brown, that sounds like Yeezus."
01:36:00;01:36:01;">> Yeah."
01:36:01;01:36:09;"[ Music ]"
01:36:09;01:36:16;">> It's kind of interesting, the super deliberate, deliberately acoustic and hand-played bass and acoustic with the beats."
01:36:16;01:36:17;">> It's a cool contrast."
01:36:17;01:36:18;">> Yeah, it's kind of interesting."
01:36:18;01:36:19;">> Shout out to Fog."
01:36:19;01:36:25;"This is actually a really interesting one because we're comparing like two very different charts, like zero crossover."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"So that's number five on the CMJ charts."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"Number five on the iTunes chart is --"
01:36:30;01:36:34;"[ Music ]"
01:36:34;01:36:37;">> Major Lazer with Justin Bieber and Mo."
01:36:37;01:36:44;"[ Music ]"
01:36:44;01:36:48;">> I have a feeling that on this countdown, almost everything is just going to be beat-driven."
01:36:48;01:36:49;">> Right."
01:36:49;01:36:55;">> Where if we did this like 20 years ago, all of the CMJ stuff would be like bass, guitar, drums."
01:36:55;01:36:56;">> Right."
01:36:56;01:36:59;">> And then all the Top 40 stuff would be also beat-driven."
01:36:59;01:37:01;">> Yeah, that's an interesting point."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"That song's fine."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"It's not my favorite of the Bieber tropical songs, but it's fine."
01:37:05;01:37:12;"So that's an interesting point, like the number five on both charts is programmed."
01:37:12;01:37:14;">> Yeah, programmed drums or beats."
01:37:14;01:37:15;">> Programmed drums."
01:37:15;01:37:16;">> Yeah."
01:37:16;01:37:18;">> Those are two very different types of songs, but it's not like there's --"
01:37:18;01:37:19;">> Those weren't that far off."
01:37:19;01:37:21;">> In a weird way, it's not like they were that far off."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"Let's go back to the --"
01:37:22;01:37:24;">> The lyrics on the Fog were trippier."
01:37:24;01:37:27;">> They were trippier, more stream of consciousness."
01:37:27;01:37:32;"Justin Bieber was more traditional like pop song writing, simple."
01:37:32;01:37:33;">> Okay."
01:37:33;01:37:37;"The number four song on the CMJ chart is called ""Kismet Kill."""
01:37:37;01:37:41;"It's by Hely Bonar, or Bonar, B-O-N-A-R."
01:37:41;01:37:42;">> Boehner?"
01:37:42;01:37:43;">> Oh, maybe it's Boehner."
01:37:43;01:37:44;">> This is John Boehner's niece."
01:37:44;01:37:46;">> No, it doesn't have the E."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Okay, so let's check it out, ""Kismet Kill."""
01:37:47;01:37:50;"[ Music ]"
01:37:50;01:37:53;">> Oh, real drums."

01:38:22;01:38:42;"[ Music ]"
01:38:42;01:38:44;">> Okay, here's what I'm going to say about that song."
01:38:44;01:38:49;"Normally, when I hear a lot of like guitar-based drums music, it's so retro, it's like boring."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"There's something about that song that's a little different."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"There's like this weird rhythm."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"[ Imitating rhythm ]"
01:38:54;01:38:56;">> There's like a weird delay on the guitar or something."
01:38:56;01:38:59;">> It had like a unique rhythm that I think made it sound kind of fresh."
01:38:59;01:39:02;"It made me think of like a sped-up version of Cranberry's ""Dreams."""
01:39:02;01:39:05;"[ Imitating rhythm ]"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Vibey."
01:39:06;01:39:08;">> Yeah, cool two-part harmony in the chorus."
01:39:08;01:39:09;">> Yeah."
01:39:09;01:39:10;">> I was down with it."
01:39:10;01:39:14;">> Well, let's compare it to its counterpart on the iTunes charts, Shawn Mendes' ""Treat You Better."""
01:39:14;01:39:18;"[ Music ]"
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Both have guitars."

01:40:19;01:40:21;"They're like arty rock."
01:40:21;01:40:22;">> You mean getting people to dance?"
01:40:22;01:40:23;">> Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean."
01:40:23;01:40:28;">> Well, and also, I guess it's kind of like one of the major differences between like, I guess what you could call college rock."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"But both those songs, they're vibey."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"It's like poetic."

01:40:32;01:40:35;"This Shawn Mendes song is called ""Treat You Better."""
01:40:35;01:40:38;"Even before we heard it, I had an inkling what it was about."

01:40:40;01:40:41;"Sometimes you do."
01:40:41;01:40:43;">> Sometimes you want the artistic ambiguity."
01:40:43;01:40:44;">> Yeah, the world needs both."
01:40:44;01:40:45;"We need CMJ and iTunes."
01:40:45;01:40:46;">> Absolutely."

01:40:48;01:40:50;"This is ""Zulu Zulu"" with ""Fades."""

01:41:46;01:41:47;">> Yeah."
01:41:47;01:41:51;">> It's cool, but also, you know, something that, like we were talking about stylistically."
01:41:51;01:41:52;">> Yeah."
01:41:52;01:41:56;">> It doesn't have textures a million miles away from anything we might find on the pop charts."
01:41:56;01:42:02;">> It's drawing on the same set of sources and inspirations as like the top five."

01:43:48;01:43:49;">> I wasn't really feeling that one."
01:43:49;01:43:55;">> Well, so just to compare so far, we've heard songs on the CMJ charts called ""Kid Kuma,"" ""Kismet Kill,"" and ""Fades."""
01:43:55;01:44:01;"And the songs we've heard on the iTunes charts are called ""Cold Water,"" ""Treat You Better,"" and ""We Don't Talk Anymore."""

01:44:09;01:44:11;"What, just sort of like which direction ahead?"

01:44:22;01:44:30;"Like if I was trying to write a song about the emptiness of late capitalism, I could go the CMJ route, and I might write a song called ""Blueberry Pie Oreo."""

01:49:47;01:49:48;">> They have been in the top five."
01:49:48;01:49:50;">> Like every episode, I just feel like we're listening to them."

01:54:48;01:54:52;">> I can't stop."
01:54:52;01:54:57;">> I can't stop."
01:54:57;01:55:24;">> Here we go."

01:55:50;01:55:51;">> Who is that?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;">> Halsey?"
01:55:52;01:55:54;">> I know she's from New Jersey."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"Okay, this is one thing I'm going to say."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"I'm not a hardcore studio nut."
01:55:58;01:56:05;"I've never been a gear head type, hate guitar center, not as a corporate brand, just as a place to go."
01:56:05;01:56:14;"Tell me if I'm crazy here, but I really hear that the two singers are singing in noticeably different rooms with noticeably different mics probably."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"So listen to the Halsey."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"Really listen to the recording quality."
01:56:18;01:56:26;">> You don't think it's deliberate?"
01:56:26;01:56:35;">> You might just have more auto tune on his voice."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Maybe they just put more compression on her vocals."
01:56:37;01:56:38;">> I don't know."
01:56:38;01:56:39;">> It's deliberate to me."
01:56:39;01:56:42;">> Maybe she was standing further from the mic."
01:56:42;01:56:43;">> What do you mean?"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"Their voices are different enough."
01:56:45;01:56:48;">> You want to feel like a duet."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"You want to feel like they're there together."
01:56:50;01:56:51;">> That's true."
01:56:51;01:56:55;"But I also feel like as we discussed earlier with the Billy Joel."
01:56:55;01:56:56;">> Tooth song."
01:56:56;01:56:59;">> We all understand that it's global pop."
01:56:59;01:57:00;">> Right."
01:57:00;01:57:02;">> And it's made by people who are spread out across the world."
01:57:02;01:57:06;">> And also when you think about this song, it might even make sense that they're not in the same place."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"You're right."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"Maybe it's deliberate."
01:57:08;01:57:13;"Apologies to the chain smokers for implying that it would have been anything other than artistic choice."
01:57:13;01:57:15;">> I like this song."
01:57:15;01:57:16;">> It's cool."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"It's corny, but it's cool."
01:57:17;01:57:19;">> Do you think it takes place in Colorado?"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Because they say your roommate back in Boulder."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Are they in Denver now?"
01:57:22;01:57:23;">> Where are the chain smokers from?"
01:57:23;01:57:24;">> Good question."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"I'm guessing Los Angeles."
01:57:26;01:57:28;">> Golden Colorado based band."
01:57:28;01:57:30;">> The chain smokers started in New York."
01:57:30;01:57:31;">> New York City?"
01:57:31;01:57:32;">> Yeah."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"I wonder where they're from, though."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Andrew Taggart."
01:57:34;01:57:35;"These guys know what they're doing."
01:57:35;01:57:38;"They're really like -- they're making a lot of big hits."
01:57:38;01:57:42;">> Three, and if this song goes platinum, they'll have four platinum singles."
01:57:42;01:57:44;">> Terrible band name."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Chain smokers?"
01:57:45;01:57:48;">> Yeah, but you know, The Beatles was a bad name, too."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"So was the Rolling Stones."
01:57:50;01:57:52;">> Rolling Stones was a tight name."
01:57:52;01:57:53;">> No, it's stupid."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"What, just a stone rolling down a mountain?"
01:57:55;01:57:59;"That's supposed to make me want to -- at least chain smoking is, like, badass."
01:57:59;01:58:02;">> No, Rolling Stones is like a force of nature."
01:58:02;01:58:03;"It's like gravity itself."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"It's, like, elemental."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"Chain smoking is just, like, a terrible, outdated habit."
01:58:07;01:58:09;">> You're not making any sense to me, dog."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"That's the top --"
01:58:10;01:58:12;">> I'm not making sense."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"You're not making sense."
01:58:13;01:58:17;">> I think you have one too many blueberry pie Oreos, my friend."
01:58:17;01:58:21;">> Well, that was interesting, comparing the college charts to the iTunes charts."
01:58:21;01:58:25;"One thing's for sure, there's a lot of great music all over the place."
01:58:25;01:58:27;">> Said with a straight face."
01:58:27;01:58:29;">> No, I believe it."
01:58:29;01:58:32;"Thank you so much to our guest, Gerard Carmichael, for coming through."
01:58:32;01:58:33;">> That was epic."
01:58:33;01:58:34;">> Always a pleasure."
01:58:34;01:58:35;"Make sure to go check it."
01:58:35;01:58:41;"I mean, at this point, we have two seasons of The Carmichael Show, an HBO special."
01:58:41;01:58:42;">> Oh, really?"
01:58:42;01:58:43;">> You never saw his HBO special?"
01:58:43;01:58:44;">> No, I should watch it."
