00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:08;"It's a dark summer, and this episode, we'll tackle it head on."
00:08;00:15;"We'll be talking about everything from conspiracy theories, to David Berman, and so much more."
00:15;00:23;"We'll also be counting down the top 5 songs on iTunes, and the top 5 Billboard hits of 1999."
00:23;00:26;"This is a summary..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:30;00:32;"B-B-B-B-Beasts."
00:32;00:34;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The world I felt, wobbly, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:03;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Leave it all on me baby"
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:20;01:23;"People are going wild for these fresh eps, man."
01:23;01:26;"They were sick of the banked eps, now we're getting some fresh eps."
01:26;01:28;"Seinfeld, how was the reaction to the last episode?"
01:28;01:31;"People are loving it."
01:31;01:33;"People are into it?"
01:33;01:35;"Yeah, people can't get enough of the fresh eps."
01:35;01:37;"You can taste the difference, you know."
01:37;01:42;"There's just a difference between an ep that's just been delivered fresh from the produce section,"
01:42;01:44;"versus been sitting on a shelf."
01:44;01:45;"It's fresher."
01:45;01:46;"Yeah, it's not a canned ep."
01:46;01:48;"It's definitely a fresher ep."
01:48;01:50;"Well Jake, how have you been the last two weeks?"
01:50;01:51;"Pretty solid."
01:51;01:55;"I like you got the Showtime Documentary Films Patagonia back on."
01:55;01:58;"This is a truly random item of clothing."
01:58;02:01;"This has come up on the show before."
02:01;02:03;"It lives in my car or in my studio."
02:03;02:05;"So you're not wearing it very often?"
02:05;02:06;"No."
02:06;02:11;"Just to paint a picture for everybody, this is a Patagonia half zip."
02:11;02:14;"It's not a heavy pile, it's a light pile."
02:14;02:20;"And on the right upper sleeve, it says Showtime Documentary Films."
02:20;02:28;"What happened was I somehow ended up in a situation where I was taking an Uber here"
02:28;02:30;"because my car broke down yesterday."
02:30;02:32;"Oh, your car broke down?"
02:32;02:34;"And I normally keep clothes in my car."
02:34;02:39;"Because I'm anticipating that the AC is going to be jacked in the Apple Music Studios,"
02:39;02:40;"and I'm not wrong."
02:40;02:41;"It's pretty jacked."
02:41;02:43;"It's frigid in here."
02:43;02:45;"And in the Uber ride over here, it was frigid."
02:45;02:47;"The guy had the temp at 60."
02:47;02:48;"[laughs]"
02:48;02:49;"God."
02:49;02:51;"It's not even that warm outside."
02:51;02:53;"No, it's like upper 70s."
02:53;02:54;"It's an LA evening."
02:54;02:55;"Yeah."
02:55;02:56;"Mid-70s."
02:56;03:00;"So I was like, ""Uh-oh, I don't have my normal wardrobe in my car."""
03:00;03:06;"I usually have a couple shirts and stuff just kind of hanging out in the passenger seat of the car."
03:06;03:07;"No car."
03:07;03:11;"This is this filthy, beat-up polar fleece."
03:11;03:13;"Basically on the floor of my studio."
03:13;03:14;"Grabbed it."
03:14;03:16;"Yeah, it's got some dog hair on it."
03:16;03:17;"Yeah, dog hair, paint."
03:17;03:18;"It smells."
03:18;03:19;"[laughs]"
03:19;03:21;"Like, really terrible."
03:21;03:22;"I look like a dirtbag right now."
03:22;03:23;"It's not your go-to."
03:23;03:24;"No."
03:24;03:26;"You don't look like that much of a dirtbag."
03:26;03:27;"That's cool."
03:27;03:31;"Real quick, lint roller on that, and actually you'd look kind of bourgeois."
03:31;03:33;"I'd look like a member of Empire Weekend."
03:33;03:35;"[laughs]"
03:35;03:36;"I mean, I have--"
03:36;03:38;"You know, like a thin polar fleece and some shorts."
03:38;03:41;"I've been pretty into this one half zip lately."
03:41;03:42;"Sorry, what's the--"
03:42;03:44;"Oh, okay, half zip is just zips halfway down."
03:44;03:46;"It's more like a third of the way down."
03:46;03:48;"That's a half zip."
03:48;03:50;"I'm not going to split hairs here."
03:50;03:53;"Well, yeah, I guess there's such a thing as a quarter zip,"
03:53;03:57;"but I just feel like it's either you're wearing a full zip or a half zip."
03:57;03:59;"Is there a three-quarter zip?"
03:59;04:00;"That would be so awkward."
04:00;04:03;"Picture if you had it all the way down, three-quarter zip."
04:03;04:05;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
04:05;04:06;"That's a good one."
04:06;04:08;"Maybe with a pocket blocking it."
04:08;04:09;"That's the reason."
04:09;04:11;"Okay, you know what, Jake?"
04:11;04:12;"I stand corrected."
04:12;04:14;"I think you're wearing a quarter zip."
04:14;04:19;"I stand corrected."
04:19;04:23;"But that's one of those little quirky things that makes me me."
04:23;04:27;"You know, as discussed on the program, I call buffalo wings buffalo wangs,"
04:27;04:29;"and I call quarter zips half zips."
04:29;04:34;"Although when you search half zip, you see stuff that's in the ballpark."
04:34;04:36;"Look, here's the thing about zips."
04:36;04:40;"The average consumer, they just want to know, does this go down all the way"
04:40;04:43;"or does this stop somewhere around my nipples?"
04:43;04:47;"You know, nobody's going to send a half zip home saying this is more like a third zip."
04:47;04:49;"Yeah, this is exactly the same level as my nips."
04:49;04:52;"The bottom of it is exactly the same level as your nips?"
04:52;04:53;"Yeah, so there's no such thing."
04:53;04:54;"It should just be called a nip zip."
04:54;04:57;"I'm putting a level on it as we speak."
04:57;04:59;"Confirmed."
04:59;05:04;"Three-quarter zip doesn't exist, but I'm seeing people calling a quarter zip a three-quarter zip."
05:04;05:06;"Oh, because three-quarters are not zipped?"
05:06;05:07;"That's right, yeah."
05:07;05:08;"They're going the opposite way."
05:08;05:10;"I've always been fascinated by the half zip."
05:10;05:13;"It kind of struck me as like--I still actually haven't seen the show,"
05:13;05:15;"but you know, a succession kind of look."
05:15;05:18;"Like a certain type of rich dude wears half zips."
05:18;05:20;"Wow, I should get more half zips, maybe."
05:20;05:21;"You should get more half zips."
05:21;05:23;"But actually, I don't like wearing them that much."
05:23;05:26;"You know, there's this one--and also, this is not a fleece."
05:26;05:28;"It's a sweater, which I think is a little bit different,"
05:28;05:32;"but there's this blue half zip that I got on a music video shoot, and I liked it so much"
05:32;05:36;"I've been wearing it on stage a bunch, and I actually got a second one."
05:36;05:38;"Sweater or fleece?"
05:38;05:39;"A sweater."
05:39;05:40;"On stage?"
05:40;05:41;"Yeah."
05:41;05:42;"Full show?"
05:42;05:46;"Yeah, I realized I don't wear a t-shirt under it, and sometimes I'll wear shorts,"
05:46;05:48;"and I'm like, ""You know what? I'm good, man."""
05:48;05:49;"We've played it."
05:49;05:52;"And as discussed, we've played some very cold shows this year."
05:52;05:53;"Chicago, notably."
05:53;05:54;"Frigid."
05:54;05:56;"I could have been wearing two half zips."
05:56;06:01;"But a fleece half zip, it's interesting because outside of on stage,"
06:01;06:03;"I always want to be able to zip something all the way down."
06:03;06:06;"I don't like taking things on and off over my head in public."
06:06;06:10;"Right, you get the t-shirt tangled up in there."
06:10;06:11;"Hair gets all static-y."
06:11;06:13;"People are like, ""Are you taking your shirt off right now? What's going on?"""
06:13;06:16;"And then also, just like, it's dangerous."
06:16;06:19;"One way or another, you're going to be--even just for a millisecond--"
06:19;06:22;"you're going to be momentarily blinded when you take a half zip off."
06:22;06:25;"Even if you do it in kind of like--you know, not like a little kid,"
06:25;06:28;"like full inside-out, over-the-head way."
06:28;06:30;"You do it in a more grown-up, like gradual, like--"
06:30;06:31;"Yeah."
06:31;06:33;"It's an awkward thing, and I don't like it."
06:33;06:35;"I like to zip all the way down."
06:35;06:36;"And I feel like you feel the same way."
06:36;06:38;"That's why this is not your go-to."
06:38;06:41;"I'm not in love with this shirt. It was a desperate move."
06:41;06:42;"But it does look good. It's a good color."
06:42;06:45;"But I'm glad I brought it because it's frigid in here."
06:45;06:46;"Yeah."
06:46;06:47;"Why do people keep everything so cold?"
06:47;06:48;"I don't know."
06:48;06:50;"It's so hard to find, like, a middle ground."
06:50;06:52;"I keep the house at 77."
06:52;06:55;"That's very warm, especially in L.A."
06:55;06:57;"Yeah, but it feels cool if it's 90 degrees out."
06:57;06:59;"You go inside, it's 77. It feels great."
06:59;07:02;"And then, you know, naturally, it'll drop to about 72, 73"
07:02;07:04;"over the course of the night."
07:04;07:05;"Right."
07:05;07:06;"Ceiling fan?"
07:06;07:07;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
07:07;07:09;"Go to sleep, and it's like 75 in the house with a ceiling fan."
07:09;07:10;"You're golden."
08:21;08:24;"All right, well, what do we want to talk about today?"
08:24;08:25;"Great question."
08:25;08:26;"Epstein?"
08:26;08:28;"I just did a, uh..."
08:28;08:31;"I just did a Q&A for the Time Crisis Wiki."
08:31;08:32;"Oh, really? What?"
08:32;08:33;"Yeah."
08:33;08:34;"The website?"
08:34;08:35;"That's what it is, a website, right?"
08:35;08:37;"What's it called, TCU?"
08:37;08:39;"Universe Wiki."
08:39;08:42;"Is it the Wikipedia page, or is it the..."
08:42;08:43;"No, no, no."
08:43;08:44;"It is, like, another thing."
08:44;08:46;"I thought somebody made a wiki for Time Crisis."
08:46;08:47;"Yeah, it's..."
08:47;08:50;"Like, or not a wiki, a Wikipedia page, but a Time Crisis wiki."
08:50;08:51;"It's the Time Crisis Universe."
08:51;08:55;"What's the difference between the Time Crisis wiki and the Wikipedia page?"
08:55;08:59;"A wiki is like a format for a kind of website."
08:59;09:03;"So, you know, you could do for something, you know, a Star Wars wiki"
09:03;09:07;"that's like the whole thing is about Star Wars."
09:07;09:08;"Yeah?"
09:08;09:10;"Has nothing to do with Wikipedia."
09:10;09:12;"It's almost like you build your own Wikipedia about whatever you want."
09:12;09:13;"Gotcha."
09:13;09:15;"So is that what it is?"
09:15;09:16;"Yeah, yeah."
09:16;09:17;"No, you nailed it."
09:17;09:21;"It's the Time Crisis Universe Wiki through Fandom.com."
09:21;09:22;"Yeah, I did a Q&A."
09:22;09:25;"Somebody who runs it hit me up on Instagram,"
09:25;09:28;"and I thought, you know, they're providing real service for the fan community."
09:28;09:29;"Must take a lot of work, right?"
09:29;09:31;"Was this over, like, DM, email?"
09:31;09:36;"They DM'd me, and then I had them, you know, email one of my associates to pass on."
09:36;09:38;"What sort of questions did they have?"
09:38;09:40;"One of them was, ""How do you guys prepare?"""
09:40;09:41;"And I kept it real."
09:41;09:43;"We don't really prepare, but the producers prepare."
09:43;09:45;"They give us information."
09:45;09:48;"Print out emails from listeners."
09:48;09:51;"It would be incorrect to say that there's no preparation for this show."
09:51;09:53;"Just Jake and I do very little of it."
09:53;09:58;"And the truth is we have the Time Crisis text thread to talk about topics."
09:58;10:05;"I feel like there's almost daily additions to the Time Crisis either email thread or text thread,"
10:05;10:09;"which is you and I, Nick and Seinfeld, and then Matt and Colin."
10:09;10:10;"That's right."
10:10;10:11;"That's like six people."
10:11;10:12;"Deep thread."
10:12;10:16;"And the truth is if we ever, like, you know, if we ever got in trouble with Apple,"
10:16;10:20;"and they're just like, ""Guys, this show's a mess. You're all over the place,"""
10:20;10:25;"we want you coming in with, you know, seven to ten topics every single time,"
10:25;10:27;"and we want you to move quickly through them."
10:27;10:29;"The listeners don't like these tangents."
10:29;10:31;"We're going to produce short little segments."
10:31;10:32;"Professional-like."
10:32;10:33;"Very professional."
10:33;10:38;"Every week there is a plethora of Time Crisis-esque--we can't even keep track."
10:38;10:40;"There's so much Time Crisis stuff in the universe."
10:40;10:41;"Yeah."
10:41;10:43;"Like, stuff sounds like it's made for Time Crisis."
10:43;10:47;"Sometimes it's not particularly Time Crisis, like you brought up Jeffrey Epstein."
10:47;10:50;"We got an email from somebody."
10:50;10:51;"Who was that email from?"
10:51;10:53;"I sent a text to the thread."
10:53;10:56;"There was a Stereogum article about Mark Foster."
10:56;10:57;"Oh, yeah."
10:57;11:03;"From Foster the People going in on some, like, kind of deep-end conspiracy theories."
11:03;11:07;"Body double, Epstein's still alive, he's in Saudi Arabia getting plastic surgery."
11:07;11:08;"A lot of people--"
11:08;11:10;"Like some serious face-off kind of stuff."
11:10;11:11;"And then we got an email--"
11:11;11:13;"From Kyle Santilli."
11:13;11:14;"What did he say?"
11:14;11:21;"Well, he said his two favorite things to listen to is, number one, Come Town, which is a podcast."
11:21;11:25;"And then he also likes Time Crisis, and, you know, my understanding is Come Town."
11:25;11:29;"And I've been aware of some of these guys via Twitter."
11:29;11:31;"Always seem like funny, smart dudes."
11:31;11:33;"And I know people who swear by the show."
11:33;11:35;"I don't listen to that many podcasts, period, though."
11:35;11:37;"One day I'll listen to it from front to back, I'm sure."
11:37;11:40;"I feel like on the road you'd have time, right?"
11:40;11:41;"If I was dry--but that's the thing."
11:41;11:44;"I think the best times to listen to podcasts are when you're driving."
11:44;11:45;"Right."
11:45;11:49;"Here and there, if somebody really tells me to listen to something, I might have it on the plane."
11:49;11:53;"But, I don't know, there's something about--I'm used to being entertained all the time."
11:53;12:02;"I'm like, okay, the plane, I'm going to be watching a movie, I'm going to have my iPad loaded up with a very engaging TV series."
12:02;12:04;"And then, so the idea of--"
12:04;12:08;"The idea of, like, a poorly recorded podcast."
12:08;12:10;"Just, like, staring at the seat in front of me."
12:10;12:11;"Eh."
12:11;12:13;"I mean, no, but maybe I could get into it."
12:13;12:15;"Like, I think we've talked about this before, Jake."
12:15;12:18;"You have the ultimate job for a podcast listener."
12:18;12:20;"Oh, yeah, I'm big into pods."
12:20;12:21;"I'm painting all day."
12:21;12:22;"Because you're painting all day."
12:22;12:23;"Yeah."
12:23;12:24;"How often do you listen to music, even?"
12:24;12:25;"It's just a mood thing."
12:25;12:26;"Yeah."
12:26;12:27;"I'll throw in music."
12:27;12:28;"I've been doing a lot of Silver Jews last week."
12:28;12:29;"Right."
12:29;12:34;"I'll do, like, an hour or two of music a day, and maybe three or four hours of pods."
12:34;12:36;"So you're listening to, like--"
12:36;12:37;"I'm all over the place."
12:37;12:39;"I subscribe to, like, dozens and dozens of pods."
12:39;12:42;"15 to 25 hours of pods a week."
12:42;12:43;"Oh, easy."
12:43;12:45;"And what's your absolute fav?"
12:45;12:46;"I don't have one."
12:46;12:47;"All depends on your mood."
12:47;12:48;"I love Chapo."
12:48;12:49;"Mm-hmm."
12:49;12:50;"I love Bill Simmons."
12:50;12:52;"What else do I like?"
12:52;12:53;"Oh, I love Red Scare."
12:53;12:54;"Nick, turn me on to Red Scare."
12:54;12:56;"You listen to Joe Rogan?"
12:56;12:57;"I do listen to Rogan."
12:57;12:58;"I listen to Bernie on Rogan."
12:58;12:59;"Good ep."
12:59;13:00;"I subscribe to Rogan."
13:00;13:01;"I'll check in."
13:01;13:02;"I listen to maybe one out of every--"
13:02;13:03;"Oh, I got to--"
13:03;13:04;"I'd like to hear Bernie on Rogan."
13:04;13:06;"Maybe one out of every five or six episodes."
13:06;13:08;"I mean, you've heard the talking points from Bernie."
13:08;13:09;"Yeah, yeah."
13:09;13:11;"Yeah, maybe it's not that interesting."
13:11;13:12;"Eh, it's kind of--"
13:12;13:13;"Well, anyway--"
13:13;13:14;"It's an interesting collision of personalities."
13:14;13:15;"The dude who emailed--"
13:15;13:17;"And so from what I understand,"
13:17;13:21;"Comptown, the Epstein story, conspiracy, scandal,"
13:21;13:23;"it's, like, super up their alley."
13:23;13:27;"You know, I'm sure that's, like, Christmas for their listeners."
13:27;13:29;"You know, it's like that's the type of specific,"
13:29;13:32;"you know, weirdo story that they're into."
13:32;13:34;"But this guy's like, ""You guys should talk about it, too."""
13:34;13:37;"It was like, you know, and I kind of appreciated that."
13:37;13:38;"I get that."
13:38;13:40;"You're into two different things, and you're like,"
13:40;13:42;"""Why don't you guys talk about it, too?"""
13:42;13:45;"But, yeah, I mean, what's the time crisis angle here?"
13:45;13:46;"I think you had a good one, Jake."
13:46;13:49;"It's that you said Mark Foster from Foster the People,"
13:49;13:50;"who I like."
13:50;13:51;"You know, I know him personally."
13:51;13:53;"Was he at the Bernie thing in Iowa?"
13:53;13:54;"Yes."
13:54;13:55;"Okay, he was."
13:55;13:57;"I'd met him here and there over the years,"
13:57;13:59;"but I think the Bernie thing was the first time"
13:59;14:00;"I, like, really talked to him."
14:00;14:01;"We all went out to a bar afterwards,"
14:01;14:03;"and I was like, ""Hell yeah."""
14:03;14:05;"We did--just for listeners who don't know--"
14:05;14:11;"we did an episode in January of '16 from Iowa"
14:11;14:12;"when Bernie was there speaking."
14:12;14:13;"Yeah."
14:13;14:15;"And then we played music and--"
14:15;14:17;"Yeah, and Mark performed, too."
14:17;14:20;"And I think he was just out there also just doing some campaigning,"
14:20;14:22;"knocking on doors and stuff."
14:22;14:26;"But I guess he or somebody in the Foster the People organization"
14:26;14:29;"has been chiming in on the Epstein saga"
14:29;14:33;"and specifically thinks that he is still alive,"
14:33;14:35;"the corpse is a body double,"
14:35;14:39;"and is getting plastic surgery in Saudi Arabia specifically."
14:39;14:40;"Yes, that's what I saw."
14:40;14:45;"The best part of the thread, though, was ""Do your own research,"""
14:45;14:47;"which I love when people tell me to do my own research"
14:47;14:52;"on massive global news events that I'm nowhere near."
14:52;14:54;"Do you mean, like, look at Twitter?"
14:54;14:55;"Right."
14:55;14:56;"It's not like you're watching a cooking show,"
14:56;14:58;"and they're just like, ""This is how much sugar I put in,"""
14:58;14:59;"but you know what?"
14:59;15:00;"You figure it out."
15:00;15:02;"You do it to taste."
15:02;15:05;"You're not going to nail this recipe the first time,"
15:05;15:08;"but just do some research."
15:08;15:11;"I mean, obviously, there's something fishy about this story,"
15:11;15:13;"although it's all like an odds game, right?"
15:13;15:17;"Many, many global events seem fishy,"
15:17;15:22;"and it doesn't mean that the official events are absolutely impossible."
15:22;15:24;"It's a question of how likely are they."
15:24;15:26;"Is it a 4 out of 5 probability they're true,"
15:26;15:27;"or is it more like a 1 out of 10?"
15:27;15:28;"Who knows?"
16:28;16:30;"But yeah, do your own research."
16:30;16:32;"That's a tough one because for most people,"
16:32;16:35;"research involves being extremely online,"
16:35;16:39;"which it's very hard to research the truth on the Internet"
16:39;16:41;"because you'll find so many people saying different things"
16:41;16:42;"that are the truth."
16:42;16:44;"You'll find things that you want to find."
16:44;16:46;"Yeah, so then to do your own research sounds like"
16:46;16:48;"some, like, Alex Jones man on the street,"
16:48;16:50;"just, like, at the prison in Manhattan."
16:50;16:51;"I've seen documents."
16:51;16:54;"Yeah, standing in front of his townhouse on the Upper East Side."
16:54;16:57;"""Let me in. I'm a citizen journalist."""
16:57;17:00;"""I have a petition here, e-signed,"
17:00;17:02;"by over 1,000 people on Twitter"
17:02;17:05;"demanding that I come in there."""
17:05;17:06;"""Sir?"""
17:06;17:09;"Yeah, obviously the Epstein death seems fishy as hell."
17:09;17:10;"Yeah."
17:10;17:12;"In case people are confused by our tone."
17:12;17:15;"I don't think he's getting facial reconstruction surgery."
17:15;17:17;"Hey, I believe that anything's possible,"
17:17;17:19;"but I just do want to say something."
17:19;17:22;"And like I said, I like Mark and I respect him,"
17:22;17:25;"but just in terms of his advice,"
17:25;17:27;"and he's totally in his right to give his advice,"
17:27;17:29;"but I want to say to all the Foster the People fans"
17:29;17:31;"and the Imagine Dragons fans,"
17:31;17:33;"because, you know, they squash their beef."
17:33;17:34;"Full circle."
17:34;17:36;"So because Mark is one of the only people"
17:36;17:38;"who had the balls to apologize to Dan from Imagine Dragons,"
17:38;17:40;"I think there's probably a lot of Imagine Dragons fans"
17:40;17:42;"who said, ""You know what?"
17:42;17:44;"We're still waiting on the guy from 1975,"
17:44;17:47;"but we're going to follow Mark Foster because he's a good dude."""
17:47;17:48;"I like the cut of his jib."
17:49;17:50;"And you know what?"
17:50;17:52;"Sometimes you can trust somebody even more"
17:52;17:54;"when they admit they're wrong."
17:54;17:55;"Is virtue untested?"
17:55;17:57;"Is it really virtue at all, man?"
17:57;17:58;"But Mark's virtue was tested."
17:58;18:00;"Somebody said, ""You know what? You hurt my feelings."""
18:00;18:02;"And Mark said, ""You know what? You're right."""
18:02;18:04;"And he checked himself and he apologized."
18:04;18:07;"So anyway, I'm more concerned about the Imagine Dragons fans"
18:07;18:09;"who now probably follow him."
18:09;18:12;"Don't fly to Saudi Arabia to try to figure this out."
18:12;18:14;"A, you probably-- Do you speak Arabic?"
18:14;18:15;"I don't know."
18:15;18:17;"How are you going to get around?"
18:17;18:19;"B, I don't know if it's a smart idea"
18:19;18:21;"for a citizen to go to another country"
18:21;18:23;"and start poking their nose around."
18:23;18:25;"I mean, if this really goes all the way to the top,"
18:25;18:27;"I just don't think you should do it."
18:27;18:29;"Not going to like what you find."
18:29;18:32;"That would be like-- God."
18:32;18:34;"That would be, like, so brutal."
18:34;18:38;"Just like when the number one Foster the People fan in Brazil"
18:38;18:41;"who runs, like, the Foster the People Brazil account"
18:41;18:43;"just, like, flies to Saudi Arabia,"
18:43;18:46;"tries to break in somewhere, immediately imprisoned,"
18:46;18:48;"got international situation on our hands."
18:48;18:49;"And I know, Mark's a good guy."
18:49;18:51;"He would feel terrible just like he felt bad"
18:51;18:53;"when he imagined dragon's beef."
18:53;18:55;"But I'm just saying, do your own research has limits."
18:55;18:57;"And in some ways, it's impossible."
18:57;18:59;"The thing that I think is interesting about this--"
18:59;19:00;"This is the tweet."
19:00;19:03;"What he's saying that's really applicable to you"
19:03;19:05;"is that more than ever, artists need to speak up"
19:05;19:07;"because they're not getting paid by sponsors"
19:07;19:10;"or told how to spin a story by their bosses."
19:10;19:12;"Rupert Murdoch isn't controlling their narrative."
19:12;19:15;"Support your artists. Support real journalism."
19:15;19:17;"Fact-check everything. Do your own research."
19:17;19:19;"Really, what he's saying is the musicians, the artists--"
19:19;19:21;"He's actually calling us-- --should be the citizen journalists."
19:21;19:22;"I love the jump from--"
19:22;19:26;"Wait, what was it? Support artists do real journalism?"
19:26;19:28;"Yeah. Two different professions."
19:28;19:29;"No, but I know what he means."
19:29;19:31;"Man, I wish we'd thought about this before."
19:31;19:32;"This is my bad."
19:32;19:34;"I would actually love to get Mark on the phone."
19:34;19:37;"Well, this is classic not prepping for the show."
19:37;19:38;"This is what happens when we don't prep."
19:38;19:39;"We don't prep."
19:39;19:40;"All right, I'll see if we can get him on the phone."
19:40;19:41;"Well, let's get Mark on the next one."
19:41;19:42;"Let's try to get him on for the next one."
19:42;19:44;"Let's have the show rolls."
19:44;19:46;"Yeah, 'cause I'd love to hear more of what he has to say"
19:46;19:48;"'cause it's true up to a point."
19:48;19:50;"I mean, most artists, Mark, myself included,"
19:50;19:53;"we've made money in some sense from sponsorship"
19:53;19:55;"of some type of major corporation."
19:55;19:58;"The whole music world is sponsored."
19:58;19:59;"And even if you're not sponsored,"
19:59;20:02;"you're written about on websites that are sponsored."
20:02;20:04;"The only people who are fully outside that ecosystem"
20:04;20:08;"are some true DIY types."
20:08;20:09;"But I know what he means."
20:09;20:11;"He's saying, like, speak up."
20:11;20:14;"Yeah, the tough part of living in these troubled times"
20:14;20:17;"is that that's what everybody's saying, you know?"
20:17;20:18;"Speak up?"
20:18;20:21;"He's 100% correct, but this idea that you're saying,"
20:21;20:24;"""Listen, you can't trust most of what's going on."
20:24;20:25;"""And me, I'm a straight shooter,"
20:25;20:28;"""and here's why those other people are compromised"
20:28;20:30;"""or they're cowardly."""
20:30;20:31;"You know, that's why you gotta trust me."
20:31;20:34;"It's the same thing that Trump says, Alex Jones says,"
20:34;20:37;"Glenn Greenwald, somebody who I actually agree with"
20:37;20:38;"most of the time."
20:38;20:39;"You know, I'm just saying, it's like,"
20:39;20:42;"that alone is not enough to convince somebody"
20:42;20:44;"because everybody kind of believes"
20:44;20:46;"that that's what they're doing a little bit."
20:46;20:47;"Damn."
20:47;20:49;"I don't think we're ever gonna get to the bottom of this."
20:49;20:51;"I mean, you know, I'm very familiar"
20:51;20:53;"with 9/11 conspiracies because I've known"
20:53;20:55;"all sorts of people who feel very strongly about it."
20:55;20:58;"It's, you know, and I've always been, like, open-minded."
20:58;21:00;"Like, lay it on me, man."
21:00;21:01;"Tell me what happened."
21:01;21:02;"Tower 7, dog."
21:02;21:04;"Yeah, some people-- and I've always been kind of like,"
21:04;21:05;"""You know what, man?"
21:05;21:07;"""At the end of the day, you might be right."""
21:07;21:08;"I've never been some, like,"
21:08;21:10;"""You gotta trust the official narrative"" person."
21:10;21:11;"What's your vibe with JFK?"
21:11;21:15;"Totally could have been killed by the mafias."
21:15;21:16;"That's what people think."
21:16;21:17;"That's one of the theories."
21:17;21:19;"Yeah, I mean, the CIA, the mafia."
21:19;21:20;"That's partially what the upcoming"
21:20;21:22;"Martin Scorsese film ""The Irishman"" is about, I think."
21:22;21:23;"Oh, really?"
21:23;21:25;"I think there's, like, a JFK connection."
21:25;21:26;"Wow, I didn't realize that."
21:26;21:27;"I haven't seen the trailer."
21:27;21:28;"All I saw was the trailer."
21:28;21:33;"I went to the JFK museum in Dallas a year or two ago,"
21:33;21:37;"and the tour ends at the window that the shots were--"
21:37;21:38;"What's it called?"
21:38;21:39;"Daly Plaza or something?"
21:39;21:40;"Daly Plaza."
21:40;21:41;"I'm not a marksman."
21:41;21:44;"I'm not experienced with riflery or guns."
21:44;21:47;"But I was shocked how close it was,"
21:47;21:50;"like, from the window that he supposedly killed JFK from"
21:50;21:53;"down to where, like, there was an X on the road"
21:53;21:54;"where the car was."
21:54;21:56;"So you looked out the window, and you were just like,"
21:56;21:57;"""Oh, easy."""
21:57;21:58;"Easy, yeah."
21:58;22:00;"But then again, I don't know anything about, like,"
22:00;22:04;"reloading a single bolt rifle."
22:04;22:05;"I don't know anything about that."
22:05;22:09;"And obviously Jack Ruby seems like a major weird wild card"
22:09;22:10;"in this story."
22:10;22:11;"Right."
22:11;22:13;"But just standing in the window and looking down,"
22:13;22:15;"I was like, ""That seems easy."""
22:15;22:17;"Just, like, point blank pretty much at that point."
22:17;22:19;"I mean, it seems pretty easy."
22:19;22:22;"Like they said in JFK, it's a turkey shoot."
22:22;22:24;"Great film."
22:24;22:25;"Never saw it."
22:25;22:26;"Really?"
22:26;22:28;"Well, you know what, Jake, I got to say, though."
22:28;22:29;"Get in on JFK, man."
22:29;22:31;"I got to say, though, to Mark's point,"
22:31;22:32;"you went and did the goddamn research."
22:32;22:33;"I did my own research."
22:33;22:34;"Jake did the research."
22:34;22:35;"No, but I didn't."
22:35;22:37;"I don't know anything about shooting a gun."
22:37;22:39;"You just kind of made, like, a gun with your hand"
22:39;22:42;"and, like, closed one eye and just looked down,"
22:42;22:45;"and it's like, ""Sir, could you move on?"""
22:45;22:46;"[laughter]"
22:46;22:48;"Oh, God, imagine the types of weird--"
22:48;22:49;"Oh, my God."
22:49;22:52;"Can you imagine the f***ers being a tour guide there?"
22:52;22:53;"The people that--"
22:53;22:55;"Well, everyone has an audio guide."
22:55;22:57;"It's like a mandatory audio guide, as I recall."
22:57;22:58;"Mandatory?"
22:58;23:00;"And so you're just like, yeah."
23:00;23:02;"Oh, because you've got to listen to the official narrative."
23:02;23:03;"That's why."
23:03;23:05;"Well, no, but they get into, like,"
23:05;23:07;"the conspiracy theories at the museum."
23:07;23:08;"But I think maybe just to, like,"
23:08;23:10;"manage the traffic flow or whatever."
23:10;23:12;"But there must be just, like,"
23:12;23:14;"super Walter Sobchak-style dudes."
23:14;23:15;"Yeah."
23:15;23:16;"Post up at that window with, like,"
23:16;23:19;"""I've actually brought a replica of a gun"
23:19;23:21;"that Oswald supposedly had."""
23:21;23:23;"Oh, I'm sure there's just so much, like,"
23:23;23:25;"unwanted conversation, too."
23:25;23:26;"[laughter]"
23:26;23:28;"Just, like, you know, like, some old couple,"
23:28;23:31;"just, like, the Walter-type dude just being like,"
23:31;23:33;"""Ha, you don't believe that horse s***, do you?"""
23:33;23:35;"And they're just like, ""What do you mean?"""
23:35;23:36;"And he's just like,"
23:36;23:38;"""There's no way that the official narrative is true."""
23:38;23:40;"It's like, ""Oh, okay, all right."""
23:40;23:41;"Uh-huh."
23:41;23:43;"Maybe that's why they have the mandatory audio tour."
23:43;23:45;"There's just too many people talking to each other."
23:45;23:46;"It's weird."
23:46;23:47;"Yeah."

25:22;25:24;"this is a very strange Time Crisis episode, too."
25:24;25:26;"It's off to a totally different town."
25:26;25:29;"The way I always felt about 9/11 was when I'd meet people"
25:29;25:31;"who very passionately felt that the official narrative"
25:31;25:34;"of 9/11 should not be true, and people would show me"
25:34;25:39;"certain evidence about, well, why did Tower 7 fall?"
25:39;25:42;"There's actually a great song that Megan Amram--"
25:42;25:44;"Who's that again?"

25:50;25:52;"No, Megan Amram is a great--"
25:52;25:54;"well, she's a writer, first and foremost."
25:54;25:56;"She's written stuff for The New Yorker,"
25:56;25:58;"but she's best known as a TV writer."
25:58;26:00;"She's one of the big writers on The Good Place,"
26:00;26:01;"and she was at Parks and Rec,"
26:01;26:04;"and she's written for Silicon Valley and The Simpsons,"
26:04;26:06;"and she's been a friend for a long time--"
26:06;26:08;"very smart, very funny person."
26:08;26:12;"And so she was really big into this song that this guy made"
26:12;26:15;"that's actually a very catchy song, so I warn you."
26:15;26:17;"Oh, wait, dude, is this-- was this in Catatonicues?"
26:17;26:19;"It's not-- yeah, he posted it."
26:19;26:21;"Okay, this is the best."
26:21;26:23;"Catatonicues posted this, but I have to shout out Megan."
26:23;26:25;"She literally-- she put me and Nick onto this"
26:25;26:26;"maybe five years ago."
26:26;26:27;"Oh, wow, okay."
26:27;26:29;"So she was very early, like when this dude had no views."
26:29;26:31;"He's--I think he's Australian."
26:31;26:33;"It's, like, hella poppy, right?"
26:33;26:34;"It's very catchy."
26:34;26:36;"Even without looking at it, I haven't heard it in a year"
26:36;26:37;"or whatever."
26:37;26:39;"I saw it briefly on Catatonics."

26:48;26:49;"Okay, we pulled it up."
26:49;26:52;"It's called ""9/11, Building 7"" by Martin Oakes."
26:52;26:53;"You know, even without playing it,"

27:49;27:50;"I don't know."
27:50;27:52;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
27:52;27:57;"Like, Peter Santera or Phil Collins wrote a 9/11 conspiracy song."
27:57;27:59;"I feel like one time I started looking him up, I was like,"
27:59;28:02;"""Oh, yeah, was he randomly in, like, you know,"
28:02;28:04;"playing keyboards and mic'ing the mechanics or something?"""

28:30;28:31;"What is he talking about?"
28:31;28:35;"I'm actually fairly familiar with this conspiracy theory"
28:35;28:36;"or alternate theory."
28:36;28:39;"I know the theory, like, the fire can't melt steel,"
28:39;28:42;"but it's like, dude, if you have, like, thousands of gallons"
28:42;28:45;"of, like, jet fuel exploding, it's sort of like--"
28:45;28:47;"I'm hesitant to send anybody down this rabbit hole,"
28:47;28:50;"but basically, of course we're familiar with what happened"
28:50;28:52;"with the World Trade Center 1 and 2."
28:52;28:53;"Yeah."
28:53;28:56;"And there's footage, again, you can believe an alternate theory"
28:56;28:59;"if you want to that those planes did not have passengers on them"
28:59;29:01;"or weren't actually commercial--"
29:01;29:03;"or there's all sorts of alternate theories"
29:03;29:05;"or that there were already bombs in the building somehow"
29:05;29:08;"to take the plane crash and turn it into something bigger."
29:08;29:12;"Okay, but at least we're familiar with what happened there."
29:12;29:13;"There was this other building,"
29:13;29:15;"which I remember watching fall on TV."
29:15;29:18;"I was over at my friend's house because they let us out of school."
29:18;29:20;"And so we were sitting there watching, and they were like,"
29:20;29:22;"""Oh, that one's going to go,"" and then it fell."
29:22;29:25;"That's become a major point for 9/11 conspiracy theorists"
29:25;29:28;"because they're like, ""Okay, if you sheeple want to believe"
29:28;29:32;"that 1 and 2 fell because of planes, we don't believe that, but whatever."""
29:32;29:34;"But look at Building 7."
29:34;29:37;"There was no serious structural damage, no plane flew into it."
29:37;29:40;"Why did it fall, and why did it fall like that?"
29:40;29:42;"So when he says, like, the buildings fell with such precision,"
29:42;29:45;"free-fall speed, no reasons given,"
29:45;29:48;"the conspiracy theorists are saying that building fell"
29:48;29:50;"like when they demolish an old building,"
29:50;29:52;"the way they load up bombs or something."
29:52;29:54;"So that's this thing people say."
29:54;29:58;"If a building was just keeling over, it might fall down in some awkward way."
29:58;30:01;"This fell down free-fall speed, like as if there was no resistance."
30:01;30:02;"Demoed."
30:03;30:05;"So anyway, that's an important part of the story."
30:05;30:07;"And so people have talked about that with me, and I say,"
30:07;30:09;"""Yeah, you know, that's weird. That's weird, man."""
30:09;30:10;"It is kind of shady."
30:10;30:14;"If you're a conspiracy and you wanted to detonate the two trade centers"
30:14;30:17;"to start the war with Iraq, it's like,"
30:17;30:20;"why detonate Building 7 too?"
30:20;30:22;"You're just going to stir up conspiracies."
30:22;30:25;"Like, the whole point--keep it clean if you're going to do it."
30:25;30:29;"Their theory is that by doing that, they destroyed information."
30:29;30:30;"Oh, information."
30:30;30:33;"I'm not a 9/11 truther. I'm super out with that theory."
30:33;30:34;"You heard it here, folks."
30:34;30:37;"Jake's takes on time crisis."
30:37;30:41;"And again, specifically about that, why did that fall?"
30:41;30:43;"I don't know, man."
30:43;30:45;"But my larger point about that one--"
30:45;30:49;"and that one I have a more clear-cut feeling because I remember"
30:49;30:52;"that I was a senior in high school when 9/11 happened."
30:52;30:54;"And, you know, in the town I grew up in--"
30:54;30:59;"I grew up in a very small town, and there were like 11 people died in the town."
30:59;31:01;"Wow. From your town?"
31:01;31:02;"Yeah."
31:02;31:03;"There were commuters?"
31:03;31:05;"Yeah, there's a plaque in the town for a bunch of people."
31:05;31:08;"I remember my dad was on his way to work in Manhattan that day."
31:08;31:09;"So anyway, that happened."
31:09;31:11;"It was like this kind of really dark, emotional thing,"
31:11;31:13;"obviously for many, many people."
31:13;31:17;"And then I remember, though, in the next year I'm a freshman in college,"
31:17;31:22;"and that's when there was the big no-war march--or anti-war march in New York."
31:22;31:26;"And I kind of remember being like--I'd never been in a crowd that big before."
31:26;31:29;"So we met up with some friends, and we went down, and it was just like--"
31:29;31:32;"I think it was a million people on the streets."
31:32;31:37;"Truly one of the biggest protests that's ever happened, at least in New York City."
31:37;31:40;"And I just remember looking at so many people and just being like--"
31:40;31:44;"and again, there wasn't like a 9/11 conspiracy presence there."
31:44;31:50;"The vibe of this anti-war march was not, ""Guys, we'd be super down if the official story was true."
31:50;31:53;"We just don't want to go to war because it's clearly an inside job."""
31:53;31:55;"Nobody said that [bleep]."
31:55;31:59;"The whole point of that was even if you buy the official narrative of 9/11,"
31:59;32:04;"that's still not a good reason to go to war with Iraq and the real conspiracy."
32:04;32:06;"So that's kind of why I've always been--"
32:06;32:08;"That's why it kills the conspiracy theories."
32:08;32:11;"Well, it doesn't kill the conspiracy theories because--"
32:11;32:13;"The official narrative is so idiotic to begin with."
32:13;32:17;"Well, I like to give people latitude to be like, ""You know what, man? You might be right."
32:17;32:22;"I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I know exactly how buildings should look when they fall or something."""
32:22;32:26;"The thing we can both agree on is that we all got bamboozled by something else."
32:26;32:28;"It's way more naked."
32:28;32:29;"Right."
32:29;32:32;"So sometimes I feel like, ""Well, we're never going to know about that for sure,"""
32:32;32:37;"and I'm not going to be condescending and be like, ""Well, I read in the New York Times that this is what happened,"""
32:37;32:40;"or, ""Because I read The Looming Tower, I know exactly--."""
32:40;32:41;"That's not my vibe."
32:41;32:43;"I'm kind of a live and let live type dude."
32:43;32:44;"But I'll just say--"
32:44;32:47;"But I'll say I'm pretty sure we'll never know what happened though,"
32:47;32:49;"and isn't it kind of funny that--"
32:49;32:50;"I'll know one thing for sure."
32:50;32:55;"I stood in a crowd of a million people saying, ""We don't want to go to a war,"" and we still did."
32:55;32:57;"Well, that's not even a conspiracy theory."
32:57;32:59;"That's just the terrible way that things work."
32:59;33:02;"Well, it's just like the Epstein thing, like to go full circle."
33:02;33:07;"I mean, assuming--him committing suicide seems pretty fishy,"
33:07;33:15;"so it seems pretty bald, nakedly sort of power hungry just to be like, ""Oh, yeah, he committed suicide, right?"
33:15;33:16;"That's the narrative. Believe it."""
33:16;33:17;"Right."
33:17;33:18;"And everyone's like, ""Really?"""
33:18;33:20;"It's like they don't need to do conspiracies."
33:20;33:21;"That's what I'm saying."
33:21;33:26;"Well, in a way, you could still say they needed 9/11 even to kick off that whole program,"
33:26;33:32;"but I guess the funny part is that people are so stupid or weak-willed or immoral or something"
33:32;33:38;"that even without the really crazy conspiracy theories, just insane stuff happens all the time."
33:38;33:45;"And I think for me, that was like a major moment of disillusionment, especially here I am living in New York City."
33:45;33:50;"I'm an adult now, and I'm watching a million people in the street, and there's even Democrats voting for the war."
33:50;33:54;"That was definitely some like, ""Whoa, the world is like insane."""
33:54;33:56;"I better start a band."
33:56;34:00;"I better start a band, man. The world needs some music."
34:00;34:04;"The only thing that's going to heal this thing is music."
34:04;34:06;"No, but I didn't start the band for a few years."
34:06;34:09;"I was doing original research for the next--"
34:09;34:10;"Right, right, right."
34:10;34:11;"Up until then."
34:11;34:12;"Doing your own research."
34:12;34:13;"I was doing my own research."
34:13;34:16;"But yeah, so I guess my point is sometimes that--"
34:16;34:20;"And I understand why people get fired up because people want to know the truth, man."
34:20;34:21;"I get it."
34:21;34:29;"But sometimes it's kind of like, well, what's most important is what happens afterwards, and does it actually logically follow?"
34:29;34:34;"Because even if tomorrow somebody could tell me, ""Well, yeah, 9/11, here's how it got done."
34:34;34:39;"There were seven people in the Bush administration who got together, and they planted the bombs, and they blah, blah, blah, and they planned it out."""
34:39;34:40;"And I'd be like--"
34:40;34:43;"And a bunch of people admitted, they're like, ""Yo, guilty as charged, man."
34:43;34:45;"This did not involve Osama bin Laden at all."
34:45;34:48;"These countries teamed up, and this is a secret society."""
34:48;34:49;"Either they proved all that stuff--"
34:49;34:50;"Did Bush know?"
34:50;34:51;"Hell no."
34:51;34:52;"Oh, yeah, probably not Bush."
34:52;34:55;"But even if somebody could prove all that to me, I'd be like, ""Damn, that's dark."""
34:55;34:59;"But then I'd also be like, ""But I still can't believe we went toward Iraq."""
34:59;35:00;"That's the crazy part."
35:00;35:02;"It still shouldn't have worked."
35:02;35:10;"Like, yeah, if you could prove to me that a very small group of powerful people did something behind closed doors, I'd be like, ""Oh, whoa."
35:10;35:11;"Okay, that's crazy."
35:11;35:12;"I didn't know that."""
35:12;35:15;"But then the stuff that happens in plain sight is still even more brutal."
35:15;35:26;"It's like you tell me that there's a bipartisan support to go to war in this country that millions of lives lost, and American and Iraqi."
35:26;35:33;"And so even with this Epstein thing, whether he's alive or not alive or whatever, it's kind of like, ""Well, what's going to happen next?"""
35:33;35:35;"That's almost the more important part."
35:35;35:43;"I mean, of course you want justice for people who were hurt and abused, but many of the people we're talking about don't even seem that particularly concerned about that."
35:43;35:44;"Right."
35:44;35:47;"They're more concerned with this global conspiracy of power and stuff."
35:47;35:48;"And it's like, ""Well, all right."
35:48;35:49;"We're going to see what happens."""
35:49;35:52;"And by the way, Jeff Bezos is still not paying taxes."
35:52;35:54;"Amazon's not paying taxes."
35:54;35:55;"Not a single nickel."
35:55;36:00;"I'm sure Jeff Bezos is, so yeah, I'm not going to make it personal, but Amazon's not."
36:00;36:02;"Bezos' plane is personal income tax."
36:02;36:03;"Yeah."
36:03;36:05;"Should we finish this terrific song?"
36:05;36:06;"Okay, this is a great song."
36:06;36:09;"Fire's not enough."
36:09;36:11;"It's such a well-written song."
36:11;36:14;"What is this guy's other material?"
36:14;36:17;"Does he have a whole YouTube channel of conspiracy songs?"
36:17;36:18;"I feel like I looked."
36:18;36:20;"He had at least a few other songs."
36:20;36:27;"But one thing that I was going to say is that clearly this Epstein story is going to continue to have a ripple effect."
36:27;36:34;"Whatever happens, I doubt it's going to end in global clarity about his actual fate."
36:34;36:35;"Right."
36:35;36:37;"I have a feeling, a bad feeling."
36:37;36:46;"And I said this. I was having a conversation with Beo actually on tour before Epstein was found dead, just about the whole story."
36:46;36:51;"And I said, ""I just have a feeling whatever happens, it's going to be good for Trump."""
36:51;36:54;"Because a lot of people looked at this story in a partisan way."
36:54;36:56;"If you're a Democrat, you're kind of like--"
36:56;36:58;"#TrumpBodyCount."
36:58;37:00;"Trump's going down off this."
37:00;37:02;"And then the Republicans immediately, ""Clinton body count."""
37:02;37:03;"And I just had this feeling."
37:03;37:05;"Both are completely asinine."
37:05;37:10;"Even if somehow he is implicated, trying to cover his own ass and did despicable things,"
37:10;37:18;"the candidate that seems to benefit time and time again from anything shady involving the Clinton family, even though he's shady,"
37:18;37:24;"and the candidate who seems to benefit from kind of like widespread distrust in the system,"
37:24;37:28;"even though he currently is the president of the system, is Donald Trump."
37:28;37:29;"You know what I mean?"
37:29;37:36;"So it's like let's say you did find out that Jeb Ramsay was in Saudi Arabia or that he was murdered, and I just don't see it."
37:36;37:43;"It's a bad feeling, but I feel like it's--the fact that even Bill Clinton knew him, it's like already a win for Trump, kind of."
37:43;37:45;"Even though Trump partied with him."
37:45;37:46;"That's hilarious."
37:46;37:47;"Because Trump's shameless."
37:47;37:50;"Yeah, and if you're shameless, that's incredibly powerful."
37:50;37:54;"The other thing is the election is 15, 16 months out."
37:54;37:56;"This is ancient history by then."
37:56;38:05;"Whatever random dumb story is happening in like October of 2020 will have like some inordinate effect on whatever happens."
38:05;38:06;"Right, if there's a recession."
38:06;38:07;"Right."
38:07;38:08;"Something like that."
38:08;38:11;"Or whatever. Just some other billionaire did something dumb."
38:11;38:14;"Oh, I'm just saying a recession would actually have an impact on Trump, I think."
38:38;38:40;"So you know what? We made it happen very quickly."
38:40;38:42;"That's the time crisis away."
38:42;38:44;"We get an idea, we see it through."
38:44;38:50;"As we were talking about Epstein and the tweets, we said we should get Mark Foster on the show."
38:50;38:52;"And you know what? He was pretty close by."
38:52;38:54;"We put out the bat signal, and now Mark is here in the studio."
38:54;38:55;"What's up, Mark?"
38:55;38:56;"How you guys doing?"
38:56;38:57;"Not bad."
38:57;39:02;"So it's funny with Twitter, just like kind of a brief thought can turn into something big."
39:02;39:10;"So you were just saying that, you know, you woke up the next morning, and you were just--the amount of pickup about your specific tweet was kind of like shocking?"
39:10;39:12;"Yeah, it was shocking for a number of reasons."
39:12;39:16;"I mean, one that news articles started to pick it up and people started to run with it."
39:16;39:23;"But also that there were a lot of--you know, you can check to see what verified accounts are tagging you, talking to you."
39:23;39:26;"All these verified accounts from like--"
39:26;39:27;"Across the political spectrum?"
39:27;39:35;"NBC, CNN, all of these commentators and people that don't follow the band."
39:35;39:40;"They're not fans--it's not like--and they're all commenting on it, and it's like a kicked a hornet's nest."
39:40;39:42;"And so it's kind of like, oh, wow."
39:42;39:48;"So I kind of went deeper on it, I guess, as opposed to shying away, which is always a tricky thing, I think."
39:48;39:54;"I mean, especially the fact that I use the band's--I mean, I don't have like a personal Twitter, and so that's kind of my only voice."
39:54;40:01;"And I don't tweet about things that are outside of the music spectrum unless I'm like furious or passionate about something."
40:01;40:03;"And this is one of those things where I was just furious."
40:03;40:09;"If somebody actually knew you--because I was talking about how like maybe one of the last times we saw each other was campaigning for Bernie in Iowa, right?"
40:09;40:10;"Yep."
40:10;40:18;"You're a very politically engaged person and following the news and stuff, so probably somebody who knows you wouldn't be surprised that you might have strong feelings about like a major event like that."
40:18;40:26;"But yeah, maybe some people just like on the official Foster the People account were just kind of like, ""Yeah, what was the tweet before that? Like, hey, announcing new tour dates."""
40:26;40:30;"Yeah, we like just released a song."
40:30;40:41;"It's one of those things where it's like when I look at like this point in history, I guess what makes me furious is that it seems like the biggest government cover-up maybe since Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination."
40:41;40:43;"Oh, I just gotta say, just because you weren't here, we were talking about that."
40:43;40:49;"Jake's been to the plaza in Dallas, and he kind of looked out the window, and he was like, ""It wouldn't be hard to make the shot."""
40:49;40:50;"That was Jake's take."
40:50;40:52;"I went to the museum."
40:52;40:53;"I've been there."
40:53;40:54;"Yeah, yeah."
40:54;40:56;"So did you stand at the window?"
40:56;40:57;"Yeah, the final stop of the tour is the window."
40:57;41:00;"So when you were eyeballing it from the window, were you like—"
41:00;41:02;"Oh, I mean, no, I don't doubt that he did it."
41:02;41:03;"Yeah."
41:03;41:04;"Why?"
41:04;41:10;"But it's the fact that, you know, after 20 hours of being interrogated, none of it was released, and then the seals were filed for 75 years."
41:10;41:14;"And even when like Trump, you know, wanted to raise his public—"
41:14;41:16;"Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
41:16;41:20;"—well, like he said he was going to release the Kennedy files, and then even then he couldn't release them all."
41:20;41:28;"And it's like if you can't release them all now, and you're the president, then there's something that obviously implicates your own government that you don't want people to see."
41:28;41:29;"Right."
41:29;41:30;"And so it's like—"
41:30;41:31;"50 years later, you still can't."
41:31;41:32;"Yeah."
41:32;41:33;"It's like everybody's dead."
41:33;41:34;"Yeah."
42:33;42:39;"So what is it about this one—obviously, we live in an insane world with injustices and cover-ups and lies every day."
42:39;42:45;"So what is it about this one that really like you couldn't think anything as crazy until going back 50 years?"
42:45;42:49;"Well, I'd known about Epstein for—I've heard about him for a long time."
42:49;42:53;"Like even in the early 2000s, I remember hearing about the Lolita Express."
42:53;42:59;"Basically, you know, this guy that would take underage girls to his island and was friends with all these really wealthy and powerful people."
42:59;43:02;"And then he got like busted. I didn't even know that he got busted."
43:02;43:06;"I just—I remember hearing kind of the rumors about this guy a long time ago."
43:06;43:09;"And then it all kind of coming to a head this year."
43:09;43:11;"He gets arrested, and I'm like, ""Oh my God."""
43:11;43:18;"You know, like justice is going to be—this guy that's like skated around the law for so long that we're actually going to get some answers."
43:18;43:25;"And I have a million questions, as I'm sure a lot of people do, of how this happened."
43:25;43:31;"It's like if you have this guy who's arguably one of the most important witnesses in custody in the history of the U.S."
43:31;43:40;"because he's got potentially incredibly damaging information on two presidents, one currently active, and who knows who else."
43:40;43:46;"You know, you got Prince Andrew in there. You got all these other people that have been implicated hanging out with Epstein on his island."
43:46;43:53;"And then this happens. And after Suicide Watch, and then you start to like look at the facts of the guards weren't checking on him."
43:53;43:57;"He was taken off Suicide Watch. His cellmate was transferred the day before."
43:57;44:03;"Well, that's what—I think maybe one of the reasons why your tweets really got a lot of people talking"
44:03;44:08;"was because when I kind of looked at social media and the news the day it came out,"
44:08;44:13;"the vast majority of like independent commentators, you know, maybe obviously not like the New York Times headliner,"
44:13;44:18;"but the vast majority of independent commentators were saying, ""This is fishy. I don't believe this guy died."""
44:18;44:21;"But you went a step beyond, which is interesting."
44:21;44:28;"And I've been doing some research, and even I was like looking up about this New York Post photo of his body being taken into the hospital and comparing it."
44:28;44:34;"And so I was looking at the Snopes article about it, and there's the Fuster the People tweet in the Snopes article about it."
44:34;44:40;"So in some ways, you've become—whether or not you want it to be, you're the voice for that particular theory."
44:40;44:46;"That's what I'm curious about is, was it the photo that set you off because you're like, ""I don't believe that's the same guy,"" or already you just didn't think—"
44:46;44:48;"Or did you read something somewhere?"
44:48;44:51;"No, no, no. I just saw the photo, and then I saw that side by side."
44:51;44:56;"What about before you saw the photo? Did you already in the back of your head think like, ""I bet he's not even dead""?"
44:56;45:01;"I think you go through all the realm of possibilities of like what happened, what could have happened."
45:01;45:07;"But the photo, to me—and look, I'm not a forensics expert. I put out a f***ing tweet, you know what I mean?"
45:07;45:15;"And then like just being a musician that wanted to put out a tweet and like start a public discourse on this guy."
45:15;45:21;"But it's like you look at the photo, and it's not the same guy. And I know that when people die—look."
45:21;45:28;"And just to fill everybody in, when I looked at the Snopes article—and obviously Snopes can't verify it's the same guy."
45:28;45:34;"But they were just saying, ""Here's one thing to keep in mind. The pictures that were side by side were taken 15 years apart, and they're from different sides of his face."
45:34;45:39;"So maybe?"" That's how they kind of put it. They weren't coming down hard one way or the other."
45:39;45:45;"15 years apart, sure. But I mean, even the photos of Epstein when he was arrested in court recently."
45:45;45:47;"Are there some profile shots?"
45:47;45:51;"I mean, there's some head-on shots. There's not like a profile shot that you can A/B."
45:51;45:56;"But even the head-on shot, like he looks much younger than the guy. The nose is different."
45:56;46:02;"He's got deep lines around his mouth. And the photo of the guy that's, you know, on the stretcher or whatever."
46:02;46:07;"Just that they don't exist. And I could be wrong. It could be him."
46:07;46:10;"And I know that when you die, things change. You physically change."
46:10;46:14;"And sometimes people look really different from photo to photo."
46:14;46:15;"Sure."
46:15;46:16;"Do you know what I mean?"
46:16;46:17;"Sure."
46:17;46:19;"Sometimes you're like, ""That's me?"""
46:19;46:20;"Sure. Totally."
46:20;46:21;"You know? I don't know."
46:21;46:28;"I mean, I think—I'm not going to hang my hat up and say, ""I believe that the body was switched,"" and stand by that."
46:28;46:30;"Right. You were asking the question."
46:30;46:34;"I mean, I think the bigger question is what really happened to Jeffrey Epstein and why. You know?"
46:34;46:42;"Right. Even in the most extreme circumstances, it's hard to understand why anybody would want to keep him alive."
46:42;46:44;"Like, it just seems easier to kill him."
46:44;46:45;"I have some theories."
46:45;46:52;"You want to talk? Because here's my question. You know, I've read a little bit. I don't know as much as you, but there's a lot of people."
46:52;46:55;"Okay. So people have wondered, ""What's Jeffrey Epstein's deal?"""
46:55;47:04;"I think it's a pretty simple thing from he could be an intelligence asset being used by multiple intelligence agencies from all around the world, the CIA, Mossad, whatever."
47:04;47:07;"I think that's 100%, by the way, that he's a spy."
47:07;47:11;"And even if somebody's a spy, it doesn't mean everything they do is spy-esque."
47:11;47:15;"It means that an intelligence agency saw how that person could be of value."
47:15;47:16;"Sure."
47:16;47:21;"So, you know, maybe he's already running the Lolita Express, and somebody's like, ""Ooh, powerful man up to no good on a plane."
47:21;47:25;"Let's talk to this guy and see if he can help us, or let's pressure him."""
47:25;47:33;"My feeling is that if you're dealing with these, like, hardcore intelligence agencies who are doing manipulative, sneaky stuff around the world,"
47:33;47:40;"and you got somebody who's in custody who might talk, you know, similar to, like, when mobsters have somebody who's going to testify against them,"
47:40;47:43;"the easiest thing to do would be to have them killed."
47:43;47:46;"So if you're going to go to the trouble of getting somebody into the prison,"
47:46;47:51;"explain to me why somebody might want to actually go through this extra hassle of keeping somebody alive."
47:51;47:59;"Well, I mean, A, I think that the island that he had set up, it seems to be like it was some sort of a honeypot situation to where it's like--"
47:59;48:01;"Get some footage of--"
48:01;48:03;"Get footage, and he was known for that."
48:03;48:07;"He was known for filming other people and their sexual exploits."
48:07;48:09;"He has tapes on a ton of powerful people."
48:09;48:15;"You know, Alexander Acosta, who resigned after being the Secretary of Labor--"
48:15;48:16;"And gave him the sweetheart deal."
48:16;48:17;"He gave him the sweetheart deal."
48:17;48:22;"In an interview, he said that when they were pressing him, saying, like, ""Why did you give him this sweetheart deal?"""
48:22;48:28;"He said, ""Basically, I was told that he was above my pay grade, that he was intelligence, and to stay away from him."""
48:28;48:30;"And that's documented."
48:30;48:32;"So who was this guy?"
48:32;48:33;"I don't know."
48:33;48:34;"You know, Mossad, GRU."
48:34;48:35;"What's GRU?"
48:35;48:37;"That's like the Russian intelligence."
48:37;48:38;"Oh, yeah."
48:38;48:39;"Or did he work for Saudi Arabia?"
48:39;48:42;"I mean, the passport that they found in the safe said that he was--"
48:42;48:44;"He lived in Saudi Arabia."
48:44;48:45;"He had an Austrian passport."
48:45;48:51;"And then the madam, the woman that, like, procured all these underage girls and kind of ran things for him as business partner,"
48:51;48:53;"her father was high up in the Mossad."
48:53;48:54;"Right."
48:54;48:55;"I read about that."
48:55;48:57;"The only thing that I'll say about some of these things is that--"
48:57;49:00;"This is certainly not to refute anything that you're saying."
49:00;49:03;"And I wonder if you find this, too, a couple of indie rock musicians."
49:03;49:05;"You know, we've seen--"
49:05;49:06;"I don't know."
49:06;49:07;"Probably neither of us define--"
49:07;49:09;"We would be incredible spies, by the way."
49:09;49:14;"I thought that there would be, like, a musician shit that would be a great spy for countries around the world."
49:14;49:15;"That's true."
49:15;49:17;"No one would suspect you guys."
49:17;49:19;"No, everybody is just like, ""This is a dumbass musician."
49:19;49:22;"What do you think he's doing?"""
49:22;49:25;"The handoff needs to happen at MoPOP in Detroit."
49:25;49:29;"No, but I'm saying, yeah, I don't know if either of us identify as indie rock musicians,"
49:29;49:37;"but I would just say, like, we're people who spend time in New York and L.A., meet powerful people, even just powerful media figures."
49:37;49:44;"I guess one thing that I've found as I've been around more powerful and rich people sometimes is that there's a certain mundane aspect to some of this."
49:44;49:49;"So, for instance, this is no way to stick up for Jeffrey Epstein or any of his buddies,"
49:49;49:58;"but when I would see a lot of people on the Internet saying stuff like, ""Yeah, you don't fly on a guy's private plane five times and don't know what he's up to."""
49:58;50:01;"And I was kind of like, ""Actually, you do."""
50:01;50:08;"Not that I've -- I haven't been on very many private planes in my life, but, like, when you're around even just, like, DJs,"
50:08;50:13;"there's a type of person who are just in settings where somebody's like, ""I'm ripping back to the Hamptons right now on the PJ."
50:13;50:16;"There's eight seats,"" and somebody would be like, ""Oh, I'll take it."""
50:16;50:22;"So this idea that there's an intimacy, to me, it's kind of the equivalent of just, like, you know, somebody would be like,"
50:22;50:28;"""You don't catch a ride five times with, like, a dude in your grad school program and not know what he's up to."""
50:28;50:36;"There is a way in which these seemingly big deal things are just a natural result of these people existing in the same kind of social milieu."
50:36;50:43;"So even I kind of wonder when people were talking about if Ghislaine Maxwell's father -- he's known as a Mossad agent or something."
50:43;50:52;"Just the idea that a wealthy guy who is a Mossad agent's daughter would end up becoming in the inner circle of another wealthy guy who might have intelligence connections."
50:52;50:59;"The crazy thing is that could borderline still be a coincidence just because powerful people tend to hang out together."
50:59;51:04;"So I'm sure there's all sorts of funny stuff where, like, somebody's like, ""Oh, what? You work for the Russians? That's crazy."
51:04;51:09;"My dad worked for Saudi Arabia."" And they're like, ""Wow, and we just met on the rowing team at Harvard. Wild."""
51:09;51:15;"And this never came up for 20 years. So anyway, that's my one caveat with some of this stuff."
51:15;51:20;"The funny thing about a global elite is it's going to create a lot of coincidences just because it's the global elite."
51:20;51:25;"It's a small group of people. But this Saudi Arabia thing is definitely fascinating."
51:25;51:26;"So that's why you --"
51:26;51:32;"Okay, so back to your original question. I mean, the only thing that I can think of -- and obviously it's a stretch --"
51:32;51:47;"but it's interesting to think about is that if he was working for a foreign government and if he was collecting this compromat for information that's damaging towards our politicians or billionaires or whatever, powerful people,"
51:47;51:56;"that they would most likely have a copy of it. If he was working for a foreign government and he was worth something to them, if he went into this and he's --"
51:56;52:08;"whatever relationship he has with them, if they want to protect him and they threaten Trump or our government with damning material that they'll release without the release of Epstein,"
52:08;52:16;"if he had diplomatic immunity while he was operating under this, which I think that he probably did based on the deal that he got from Acosta,"
52:16;52:23;"that maybe the U.S. was like, ""All right, technically we have to send him back to Saudi Arabia, so we're going to cook up this whole scheme."""
52:23;52:31;"I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I just wouldn't put it past -- it's -- why would that be harder for them to swap him out with somebody that looks somewhat like him"
52:31;52:38;"or to try to doctor somebody to look like him and swap him out in the middle of the night when they basically told the guards to back off,"
52:38;52:43;"they stopped monitoring his cell, they moved his cellmate out, they cleared it all out. It's the U.S. government."
52:43;52:45;"They could walk in there, swap him out, trade him back."
52:45;52:54;"Well, that seems easier to do than 9/11. Before you came in, I was also -- we were also talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories, which again --"
52:54;52:55;"It ain't hard."
52:55;53:02;"Because that's the thing also when I've talked to people who feel very strongly about 9/11 being an inside job, and as I was saying before you came here,"
53:02;53:08;"I'm a very live and let live, open-minded kind of guy. I'm like, ""Hey, man, I don't believe everything the New York Times says."""
53:08;53:15;"And they're like, ""Sure, tell me why you think that is."" But one thing about that is always like, ""Well, if that in fact was an inside job,"
53:15;53:21;"I'm glad they didn't ask me to help because that sounds like a lot of work. That sounds very, very complicated."""
53:21;53:27;"Well, you're right. Compared to that, like, you know, because maybe you could do that with five people. I don't know. I believe that."
53:27;53:30;"I believe you could -- you swap a body and get a guy on a --"
53:30;53:32;"I mean, if you're talking about somebody that has --"
53:32;53:39;"If you're talking about somebody that has information that's going to bring down your entire government, you know, from the top down,"
53:39;53:40;"they're not going to stop at anything."
53:40;53:46;"That's one question that I have is because -- and I know this is not what you're gesturing at, but within the world of conspiracy theorists,"
53:46;53:51;"there's kind of like a spectrum. There's people -- obviously on one end of the spectrum, you have people who are not conspiracy theorists who say,"
53:51;53:57;"""I believe what the mainstream media says. It's the truth."" And then on the other side, the most extreme side, you have people who say,"
53:57;54:03;"""Not only is that not the truth, the very nature of reality that you understand is not the truth,"
54:03;54:08;"and that these guys are hiding big secrets about, you know, the way the entire universe is structured."""
54:08;54:16;"And that seems a little bit extreme, too. And, you know, what you're saying is something in between about the way the intelligence community gathers information and blackmails."
54:16;54:20;"You're like, ""Sure, I believe that there's all sorts of stuff that we don't know about that exists in that world."""
54:20;54:25;"I guess one question that I have -- and again, I also want to make the point that it's very cool of you to come on the show"
54:25;54:30;"because your whole thing that you said when I actually read all of the tweets, when you said, ""Do your own research,"""
54:30;54:36;"you weren't actually encouraging Foster the People fans to fly to Saudi Arabia. This is your chance to clarify that, right?"
54:36;54:37;"Yeah, that's not --"
54:37;54:39;"Right. You were kind of just saying --"
54:39;54:44;"It was more of a broad statement of like, you know, you need to read information and not just watch television for your news."
54:44;54:46;"Right. And also your point about like, yeah, I'm an artist --"
54:46;54:48;"Or get your news from memes."
54:48;54:54;"I'm an artist and I'm just a person who kind of is just talking about stuff like -- yeah, so when I saw the whole context of it,"
54:54;54:59;"you're definitely not trying to like say, ""Guys, I'm an expert on this and I know what happened."""
54:59;55:02;"So I feel bad now peppering you with the questions. It's kind of like, ""Well, tell me about this."""
55:02;55:04;"But I just -- so I just want to make clear we're just talking about it."
55:06;55:09;"I'm gonna fight for how I want to live"
55:09;55:13;"Spark up the riots, guess I'm a criminal and a futurist"
55:13;55:18;"Well, the charges I've caught won't stand your trial"
55:18;55:21;"You can take it out on me"
55:21;55:26;"Yeah, I've been to hell, but I've learned to keep my cool"
55:26;55:31;"Hold on to the devil, got him by the throat 'cause I refuse"
55:31;55:35;"Yeah, I won't take my last breath in denial"
55:35;55:38;"But you can't take it from me"
55:38;55:43;"Yeah, I've seen peaks been released into the prisons below"
55:43;55:48;"My days here disappear, there's things that I can't ignore"
55:48;55:54;"The sweetest release might take a while"
55:54;55:58;"So take me out and starve"
55:58;56:02;"Yeah, you"
56:02;56:07;"Yeah, just take me out and starve"
56:07;56:13;"Oh, if you're gonna take me out, take me out and starve"
56:13;56:18;"So one thing that's crossed my mind thinking about it, and I could believe anything, man, almost anything, but why --"
56:18;56:27;"So what you're saying makes sense. Like, sure, there's a plausible explanation for why it might be important to get that guy out of there"
56:27;56:33;"and he's a foreign intelligence asset and the U.S. has a diplomatic community. I can believe that."
56:33;56:38;"But there's also a part of me that's like, why does the global elite care so much about these three knuckleheads?"
56:38;56:45;"Bill Clinton's basically on his last legs in terms of public standing. Trump kind of seems like more trouble than he's worth."
56:45;56:51;"Prince Andrew, not even Prince Charles. There's like a part of me that's like, okay, let's say there are like nine kind of powerful dudes."
56:51;56:54;"The global elite could keep on trucking, could be like, oh my God."
56:54;56:59;"I mean, if we're talking in that universe of the global elite making the call for this to happen,"
56:59;57:04;"I don't really think the global elite would have made the call for this to happen because I don't think they would care about something like that."
57:04;57:11;"I think that it would be Donald Trump, basically our government, protecting their own asses."
57:11;57:13;"In some ways specifically protecting Trump."
57:13;57:20;"The Clintons don't have the power. There's no way the Clintons could be behind -- that was like the one thing when all the fallout happened, all that stuff."
57:20;57:25;"It's like, okay, like they're out of power. They couldn't pull this off if they wanted to."
57:25;57:32;"But our current government could. And especially if you look at it, you know, Attorney General Bill Barr and you look at Acosta,"
57:32;57:36;"two guys that were closely related to Epstein and protecting Epstein."
57:36;57:41;"Barr was, he worked for the attorney's office that represented Epstein in the sweetheart deal."
57:41;57:45;"Acosta was the lawyer that gave him the deal."
57:45;57:49;"And both those guys were then promoted heavily by Donald Trump."
57:49;57:54;"He's keeping those people close to him that helped protect this guy that might have some dark secrets on him."
57:54;57:59;"Maybe that's been my question is because, you know, with spicy topics like this,"
57:59;58:06;"you'll see such a range of opinion and you'll see people taking it into like, well, you got to understand this is like the whole fate of the world hinges on this."
58:06;58:10;"And you're kind of saying, no, maybe it's actually, it's as simple as a mafia thing."
58:10;58:15;"It's as simple as one guy trying to protect his ass and using and the intelligence communities being like,"
58:15;58:19;"we don't want to really release details about how we do stuff."
58:19;58:26;"Yeah. Like maybe it's actually not. There's something about the word conspiracy theory that sometimes makes people think of like, you know, reptilians and like aliens and stuff."
58:26;58:30;"It could be as simple as just like a few people being like, whoa, let's see."
58:30;58:33;"There's probably only a handful of people that know what happened."
58:33;58:36;"I don't think that there's hundreds of people involved, that there's some order."
58:36;58:39;"It's like you can't keep a secret, you know, it's like, but you can keep a secret with five people."
58:39;58:43;"The darkest thing of all that I was saying is, and I wonder what you think about this."
58:43;58:47;"My feeling is that there's almost no way that this is a bad thing for Trump."
58:47;58:54;"The fact that the Clinton name is even remotely associated with this because Trump is the epitome of shamelessness."
58:54;59:07;"He's the point one percent of bacteria that don't get killed by bacterial sites because he clearly is the Teflon Don and his fans and supporters will turn anything into a win for him."
59:07;59:10;"And then you see him, you know, retweeting the Clinton body count stuff."
59:10;59:14;"There's a part of me that's like, there could be all sorts of stuff that comes out in the next few months."
59:14;59:18;"And I still have this weird feeling like it's going to be a win for him."
59:18;59:24;"Another reason why I think he's so desperate to protect, you know, now he's campaigning for the next election already."
59:24;59:31;"And he's so desperate to protect his name and to win again because he knows that if he wins again, he can hide behind executive privilege."
59:31;59:35;"He's protected for another four years from going to jail and all sorts of other lawsuits."
59:35;59:39;"You know, he's gotten he's skirted around pretty much any kind of law."
59:39;59:41;"There's no rule of law right now."
59:41;59:46;"Yeah. I mean, when it's applied to President Trump and anybody that's around him, he's made that clear."
59:46;59:55;"So I think like his number one fear right now is that he's going to get unseated and that he's going to have to, like, go to court and say to New York and federal level."
59:55;01:00:01;"All these open, you know, cases against him are going to come to fruition and he's going to who knows what will happen."
01:00:01;01:00:07;"Well, shifting gears to the message of hope, you still you still think there's anybody who could beat him?"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"You still like Bernie?"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"I think that every Democrat running right now has a chance to beat him."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"Yeah, I agree with that. They all have a chance."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"I think it's going to be interesting."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"I think it's the Dems to lose, which could easily happen."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"I just hope it's not Biden."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"I know."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"Biden's kind of the easiest one to see losing in a way."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Yeah."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"Having just some major brain fart on stage during those debates."
01:00:29;01:00:34;"Yeah, it's not looking good. He seemed to think that he was the vice president during the Parkland shooting recently."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Yeah, some basic cognitive problems."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Not a strong look."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"Mark, while you're here, you have come up on the show before."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"We normally don't cover too much kind of politics."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"We haven't covered Jeffrey Epstein too much, but we have covered Imagine Dragons quite a bit."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"Okay."
01:01:56;01:02:02;"And when the guy from Imagine Dragons, Dan, wrote his thing about, you know, how it bums him out that everybody's picking on him."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"We covered that. We talked about that."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"Right."
01:02:05;01:02:11;"And we were very happy to see that of all the people he talked about who kind of hurt his feelings, you were the only person who apologized."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"So we gave you a lot of props for that."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"So you're welcome."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"We gave you a lot of props."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Oh, thank you."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"No, but I really thought, you know, it's like."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"Very kind."
01:02:21;01:02:29;"And we were just talking about it recently because as opposed to you kind of like taking a step back and being like, damn, maybe I said something that hurt somebody that wasn't cool."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"And you apologized unreservedly."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"One of the guys from the 1975, he went the other direction."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"He was just like, man, why do you care?"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Like he was kind of like, whatever, but whatever."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"That's a whole nother story."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"Anyway, yes, I just want to say I thought that was cool of you."
01:02:43;01:02:49;"I'm curious, like you and that guy from Madden Dragons know each other at all or this was all just happening fully across the universe of the Internet."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"We've definitely met like in passing early, early, early on."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"I think like the third Foster the People show ever."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"They were on the bills at the Viper Room."
01:02:58;01:03:03;"Yeah, but I mean, the whole band had changed like when they emerged like three years later."
01:03:03;01:03:07;"You know, it's like when we were all kind of just like, you know, small, tiny bands just starting out."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"But no, I don't really know."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"I don't really know."
01:03:09;01:03:14;"It was a passing comment, but it was it was whatever you said, I don't think was particularly mean."
01:03:14;01:03:22;"No, but I mean, it was more about his reaction and kind of like realizing like, oh, OK, I don't want to disparage anybody else for their art."
01:03:22;01:03:35;"And I just feel like it was just kind of like just take the high road and support somebody who obviously wants to do good things for his community, you know, and separate myself from the music itself."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"It's like the guy's a good guy."
01:03:36;01:03:47;"I think that sometimes, you know, like a battle in music, whether it's hip hop or rock or whatever, if both parties kind of understand what's going on, then you can kind of turn it into a game."
01:03:47;01:03:55;"And then it becomes some sort of entertainment, kind of like this weird form of entertainment where it's like they both know the game they're playing and they both go back and forth."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"And the press kind of like pro wrestling."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"I mean, look at Oasis."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Look at Liam and Noel."
01:04:00;01:04:08;"Right. Like they play off each other brilliantly in the press and they've kept Oasis completely relevant for the last like 20 years."
01:04:08;01:04:14;"Right. And like the second Oasis announced the tour and they get back together, it's going to make an astronomical amount of money."
01:04:14;01:04:19;"Oh, it'll be huge because people are going to be like, wow, the two brothers are there together again on stage."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Can you believe it? They're not fist fighting. And then the ticket sales go down."
01:04:21;01:04:26;"They'll like, you know, they'll get into some kind of a better narrative than just like it's real life."
01:04:26;01:04:29;"You know, it's Jerry Springer. Things cooled off."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"Fifth album wasn't received as well as the first three."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"And, you know, they got into some different stuff."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"Noel really got into golf and yeah, they talk all the time."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"They love to do a few gigs."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"You know, just depends on schedule."
01:04:41;01:04:46;"It's like, yeah, versus like, holy, I never thought I'd see those two guys on stage together again."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Right. It's way better. Way better. Way better."
01:04:48;01:04:55;"But yeah, I mean, it was so, you know, look, you know, when he came out and said that it's so genuine and it really like really struck me."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"We're just like, oh, right. So you didn't feel defensive."
01:04:57;01:05:01;"You were just immediately like, oh, man, I'm sure you probably didn't even remember whatever you said."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"It's not like this is a campaign you waged against them."
01:05:04;01:05:08;"No, no. And it's just I don't know. It's just kind of like we're all artists making music."
01:05:08;01:05:12;"I feel like music is supposed to be unifying. Art is subjective anyway."
01:05:12;01:05:17;"It's like, who am I to like disparage somebody else for something they obviously a lot of other people like it."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Yeah. You know, I don't need to be that guy."
01:05:19;01:05:24;"I think just anybody who like makes music or thinks deeply about music."
01:05:24;01:05:30;"There's all sorts of music that maybe, you know, I didn't like when I was 12 and then I liked it when I was 17."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Then I didn't like it again. And now I think it's actually really interesting."
01:05:32;01:05:38;"So there's even that aspect to that. It's like a throwaway comment about how you feel about music in a moment."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"Yeah. You might have meant it then. I don't like this."
01:05:40;01:05:46;"But then, yeah, who knows, in a different context or getting to know somebody, you hear it totally differently, too."
01:05:46;01:05:50;"So totally. Yeah. Well, Mark, thanks so much for coming in."
01:05:50;01:05:56;"And actually, just to kind of reiterate the main focus of your tweets, which is not necessarily which narrative is correct."
01:05:56;01:05:59;"But what do you want to say to the people like the general."
01:05:59;01:06:04;"Because I like I like your general statement about thinking for yourself."
01:06:04;01:06:08;"You know, I guess I would say that I feel like we're you know, we're living in an age of misinformation."
01:06:08;01:06:12;"People need to do their own research and dig and not believe everything that you hear."
01:06:12;01:06:21;"And another thing, I'm a little bit of a pessimist in that I feel like with a lot of these cover ups and, you know, misinformation campaigns."
01:06:21;01:06:26;"I'm a pessimist in the sense that I'm sympathetic to a lot of different theories or at least I'm open to them."
01:06:26;01:06:30;"But I have this kind of feeling like we're never going to know. We're never going to know."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"Yeah, like we're never going to know. I think in some way, I 100 percent agree."
01:06:33;01:06:42;"We're never going to know. So again, when I actually saw your tweets in context and I thought like, OK, did Jeffrey Epstein go get John Travolta's face put on him in Saudi Arabia?"
01:06:42;01:06:46;"We're never going to know. We will never know the real story."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"So what you said on Twitter, let's say that story is 100 percent accurate."
01:06:49;01:06:53;"You'll never be proven right because we will never know that."
01:06:53;01:07:01;"You'll only know if I drive off of a bridge and it was considered to be if I die from natural causes."
01:07:01;01:07:07;"Well, yeah. And even then we'll fight. We'll keep your memory alive and fight for the truth on TC."
01:07:07;01:07:14;"But even then you'll never know. So I think the interesting point that you're making is like a healthy distrust of information."
01:07:14;01:07:20;"Maybe no false people are going to go to Saudi Arabia and crack the case on that one."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"But I think the real point you're making is, OK, this is clearly very shady."
01:07:24;01:07:30;"So maybe next time you can make a decision, you can make a decision like choosing who you're going to vote for."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"Yeah. Or watch the way that the different Democrats talk to each other."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"And one person says, I think this is a big problem. Somebody says, oh, man, we like we don't have time to worry about that."
01:07:38;01:07:42;"Or that's, you know, bullsh*t. I do think that there's a kind of mindset."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"You can't take the truth away from this. I don't think that's going to happen."
01:07:44;01:07:48;"But you could take a mindset away that can hopefully be applied for good."
01:07:48;01:07:55;"Well, I think it's just also just pay attention to the larger picture of kind of what's happening with with the media,"
01:07:55;01:08:02;"with stories getting spun and with the way that like people are getting manipulated one way or the next based on whatever narrative."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"Well, there was another one this week, a much smaller story."
01:08:05;01:08:10;"I don't know if you saw this, that Bernie Sanders, we were talking about how, you know,"
01:08:10;01:08:14;"conspiracy in plain sight is kind of how Amazon doesn't pay taxes."
01:08:14;01:08:19;"And again, let's give Jeff Bezos a break for a second. Let's just say that's f*cked up that company does that."
01:08:19;01:08:26;"And so Bernie was doing press and he, you know, he rails against Amazon, says they don't I don't like the way they operate."
01:08:26;01:08:30;"I don't like the fact that they didn't pay a nickel in taxes."
01:08:30;01:08:37;"And then he said, and, you know, by the way, The Washington Post owned by Jeff Bezos, maybe that's why they don't like me."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"And the truth is, The Washington Post has gone pretty hard on Bernie."
01:08:40;01:08:45;"It's not like he's pulling that out of nowhere. But then what was interesting is that I saw a lot of Bernie supporters being like, thank you."
01:08:45;01:08:53;"And then I saw a lot, a lot of other people being like, oh, Bernie, with the press is against me, Trump-esque conspiracy theories, like, chill out, man."
01:08:53;01:09:01;"And I was kind of like shocked. I was like, look, again, you don't need to, whether he's in Saudi Arabia, dead or killed himself,"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"whatever you think, there's something fishy about the Epstein thing."
01:09:03;01:09:08;"You just think a few days after that, there might be, even if you can't take away the truth from the Epstein situation,"
01:09:08;01:09:13;"you could take away some healthy distrust and be like, you know what, Bernie, I might not agree with you about politics,"
01:09:13;01:09:22;"but you're absolutely right that billionaires owning the press probably makes information flow in a way that's good for them"
01:09:22;01:09:27;"and not necessarily good for everybody else. But it was amazing how many people got angry at Bernie for saying that."
01:09:27;01:09:30;"Of course. I looked it up before I came in here. Oh, really?"
01:09:30;01:09:34;"I was just curious who ran basically mass media around the world."
01:09:34;01:09:42;"And it comes down to about, I think it's 15 guys that own all these mega companies and conglomerates,"
01:09:42;01:09:47;"where they all, you know, how they all spider web out of kind of the main brain of the company."
01:09:47;01:09:55;"15 people, you know, so they can control the narrative basically for the news around the entire world."
01:09:55;01:10:05;"And the thing about, I guess that rattled me about this Epstein story was that it reminded me of the Stephen Paddock shooting in Vegas."
01:10:05;01:10:11;"Because that whole thing, I'm convinced was a cover up. And I was haunted by it for months."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"So you feel like the people just never knew the true story?"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"We never, no, we never got the story."
01:10:16;01:10:20;"And just to clarify, this is the guy who set up at a hotel and shot up the country music festival."
01:10:20;01:10:26;"Right. Yeah, right. Yeah, we never got the story. And there were all these eyewitness accounts of people saying the FBI came in,"
01:10:26;01:10:30;"took their phones and cleared their phones of any videos of the shooting."
01:10:30;01:10:35;"I mean, there was 25 different facts about that. We don't have time."
01:10:35;01:10:39;"This isn't really the place to get into it, but I'm convinced that that was a cover up."
01:10:39;01:10:44;"And the thing about the way that the media works, and that's what's scary to me with this Epstein thing,"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"is that, I mean, there were two mass shootings that happened earlier this week."
01:10:47;01:10:52;"Nobody's talking about that anymore. You know, there's kids in cages. Nobody's talking about that anymore."
01:10:52;01:10:58;"The media can take people's attention like Plato and point it whatever direction they want"
01:10:58;01:11:03;"and get it away from the thing that they actually want to, you know, continue to get away with."
01:11:03;01:11:08;"The Paddock thing was scary because after a week, nobody covered it anymore."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"There was no investigative journalism."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"People don't have the bandwidth and part of that is just the fact that..."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Five years ago, we would have known everything about that guy."
01:11:15;01:11:20;"Right. Well, even when people live on the Internet, it really does turn all of our brains to mush a little bit."
01:11:20;01:11:25;"Sometimes when you're like half asleep, like scrolling through your phone, you just realize like,"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"""Oh, wow, like my comprehension skills aren't as good."""
01:11:28;01:11:35;"It's like there's unprecedented access to information, but clearly we're all becoming a little bit brain damaged."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"Yeah, and you think about things that happened in the past."
01:11:38;01:11:43;"You know, think about like the Unabomber. He killed, I think, three people, four people."
01:11:43;01:11:46;"And he was a point of focus for like a decade."
01:11:46;01:11:50;"I mean, to be fair, I guess that's a bad example because he was at large for a decade."
01:11:50;01:11:56;"But there were individual shootings and events that took place that clearly would be talked about for months and months."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"And it's, yeah, it's overload."
01:11:58;01:12:04;"I don't know if that's, that might just be the nature of the technology that disseminates information."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"But yeah, I know what you mean."
01:12:06;01:12:12;"It's like, it's not hard to imagine the time when the Epstein story will be supplanted by something else."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"Yeah. Unless things continue to get uncovered."
01:12:15;01:12:21;"Like, you know, there was a 12-man SWAT team that raided his island yesterday."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Oh, yeah. I saw some drone footage of that."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"Did you see the drone footage? Like some random dude just like sent a drone over there?"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"No. No, really?"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Yeah, I don't know if there's any."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Well, anyway, thanks so much for coming in. I hope you'll come back."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"Thanks for having me."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"And you got a favorite Oasis song?"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"I think it would be relevant to play ""Don't Look Back in Anger."""

01:14:09;01:14:10;"Dark energy."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"There definitely is some dark energy out there."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Now, I gotta admit something."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Jake, I know you're a big fan,"
01:14:16;01:14:21;"and I'm very sad to see the news about the musician Dave Berman dying,"
01:14:21;01:14:24;"but I've never actually been that familiar with his music."
01:14:24;01:14:27;"You know, I was like, I know, you know, 'cause I follow him,"
01:14:27;01:14:31;"'cause I follow music, I'm like, oh, yeah, he had Silver Jues and stuff,"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"but it's just music I've never been that familiar with."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"So you were saying you've been listening a lot."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"You're a big fan."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"Oh, yeah, I've been a fan for 25 years probably."
01:14:39;01:14:44;"I think Starlight Walker was 94, and I was a huge Pavement head,"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"so he came from that universe."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"He was like a college buddy with the Pavement dudes."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Seen him live?"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Saw him live once."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Not good."
01:14:54;01:14:55;"Yeah?"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"He was a poet and a songwriter, not a rock star."
01:14:58;01:15:02;"Was he like the Robert Hunter to Pavement's Grateful Dead?"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"That's an interesting analogy."
01:15:04;01:15:08;"I mean, you could see a similarity between the Pavement lyrical aesthetic"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"and the Silver Jues one."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"They made music together too."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"Yeah, Malcolms was on the--well, he was on a few of the Silver Jues records."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"Right."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"You don't know any of it?"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"You know, when I was listening to some of the music, you know,"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"you hear the sad story, and I was--and, you know, it sounded familiar."
01:15:23;01:15:26;"I see here that the last song that the Silver Jues performed live"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"was Smith & Jones Forever."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"I played that one, and I was like, ""Oh, yeah, this sounds familiar."""
01:15:30;01:15:33;"You know, it's one of those artists that I just kind of always assumed,"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"""Oh, yeah, like I'll go check that out one day."""
01:15:36;01:15:38;"The reputation is not really as a live band."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"It's really like--"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"Well, I noticed that when I saw a commentary about it that, yeah,"
01:15:41;01:15:46;"there was a lot of special attention paid to him as a poet and a lyricist."
01:15:46;01:15:50;"I mean, bring up the song before Smith & Jones Forever."
01:15:50;01:15:53;"It's called ""Random Rules,"" track one on ""American Water."""
01:15:53;01:15:57;"In 1984"
01:15:57;01:16:03;"I was hospitalized for approaching perfection"
01:16:03;01:16:07;"Slowly screwing my way across Europe"
01:16:07;01:16:13;"They had to make a correction"
01:16:13;01:16:17;"Broken and smoking where the infrared deer"
01:16:17;01:16:22;"Can't shake hands when they make your hands shake"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"I tell you they make it so you can't shake hands"
01:16:26;01:16:31;"When they make your hands shake"
01:16:31;01:16:36;"I know you like to line dance"
01:16:36;01:16:40;"Everything so democratic and cool"
01:16:40;01:16:44;"We played last Friday night. Richard Pictures played."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Oh, right. Yeah, it was a gig."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Three-hour gig."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"At Old Town Pub?"
01:16:48;01:16:49;"Yeah."
01:16:49;01:16:52;"I know that a lot of what I say"
01:16:52;01:16:56;"Has been lifted off of men's room walls"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"We were going to maybe play this, but we decided against it."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"We're going to do some Silver Juice songs."
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Oh, tight."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"In the manner of the dead."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"We have another gig in Ohio in a few weeks."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Oh, sick."
01:17:05;01:17:10;"But nothing can change the fact"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"That we used to share"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"It's a little surprising to me, actually, that you didn't listen."
01:17:14;01:17:19;"I think that he's sort of as close as what we had"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"To sort of a Leonard Cohen."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"Yeah."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"I mean, I spent a lot of time with Leonard Cohen."
01:17:25;01:17:29;"And it's a very deadpan aesthetic, the way Leonard Cohen was."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"No, from everything I've read about him"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"Since his death and stuff,"
01:17:34;01:17:38;"He seems like a very talented, fascinating artist."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"The truth is, this strain of indie rock"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Was never exactly..."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"I wasn't the right age to engage with it."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"I'm a music nerd, so I know all this stuff."
01:17:48;01:17:52;"And I know Pavement, and I know Silver Juice, and GBV and stuff."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"It's just like, I don't know."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"It just wasn't quite the right..."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"I mean, I am the perfect age."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"And the perfect dude."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"To be a fan of this stuff."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"My brother and I have been talking about this all week."
01:18:05;01:18:10;"I remember listening to these records 25 years ago with my brother."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"When he was probably like 13."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Yeah."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"And I was like, oh man, I hadn't heard The Natural Bridge,"
01:18:15;01:18:18;"Which is a great record from '96, I think."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"I was like, I hadn't heard The Natural Bridge in more than 10 years."
01:18:20;01:18:23;"And I couldn't believe how many of the lyrics I remembered."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Right."
01:18:24;01:18:27;"So many lyrics, and I'm not even a huge lyrics guy."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"But when you listen to something enough..."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"It's just like, indelible."
01:18:31;01:18:35;"No guidance when random rules"
01:18:35;01:18:41;"I asked a painter"
01:18:41;01:18:45;"Why the roads are colored black"
01:18:45;01:18:52;"He said, Steve, it's because people leave in no highway"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"And bring them back"
01:18:54;01:18:59;"So if you don't want me"
01:18:59;01:19:03;"I promise not to linger"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"Oh, this lyric."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"But before I go"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"I've got to ask you dear"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"About that tan line on your ring finger"
01:19:13;01:19:17;"That's one of the more quoted ones in all the bits."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"There's a song, if you bring up The Natural Bridge,"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"What's the fourth song?"
01:19:22;01:19:23;"It's like the..."
01:19:23;01:19:25;"Ballad of Reverend War Character?"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Bring that up."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"Musically, very..."
01:19:28;01:19:32;"Low key and minor."
01:19:32;01:19:38;"But every line is like its own discreet short story."
01:19:38;01:19:44;"And Embry's last photograph"
01:19:44;01:19:48;"He disappears over a hill"
01:19:48;01:19:52;"Daryl Dodson"

01:19:56;01:20:04;"The stars don't shine upon us"
01:20:04;01:20:10;"We're in the way of their light"
01:20:10;01:20:16;"No, the stars don't shine upon us"
01:20:16;01:20:21;"We're in the way of their light"
01:20:21;01:20:27;"And the new girl in Tahoe"

01:20:52;01:20:54;"What era were you listening to this in a lot?"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"Like, delivering pizzas in Portland?"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"You playing a cassette of this?"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"No, before that."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"College?"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"Yeah, like, when it came out, like '96."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"Yeah, well, you were in college in '96."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Yeah, like freshman."
01:21:08;01:21:11;"But I remember my brother and I were listening to this,"
01:21:11;01:21:16;"And like, it's so anti-social in terms of like the delivery,"
01:21:16;01:21:20;"And like the vibe, and like the tones are all just like"
01:21:20;01:21:23;"Kind of mid-low tones, like real muddy."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"Deliberately low energy and muddy."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"And we were just like, ""What is this?"""
01:21:28;01:21:30;"But it like stuck with us."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"No, I could see it, yeah."

01:23:11;01:23:13;"Maybe you guys should throw together a playlist."
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Can do."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"I'd like to listen to that."
01:23:16;01:23:20;"So, guys, we got a new song from Patrick."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"How did you guys already hear this song?"

01:23:24;01:23:25;"I think all of us."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Maybe he's not throwing you in that thread."

01:25:10;01:25:12;"Why 1999?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"A few reasons."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Yeah."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"This is episode 99."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"You're kidding."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"That we're recording right now."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"That was one of the questions from the TC Wiki,"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"was you have anything special planned for episode 100?"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"Well, we're coming up on it."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Yeah, we gotta figure something out."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"And I graduated college in '99."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"Wow."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"And it's 20 years ago."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"'99 was kind of a big year for me."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"Oh, or maybe '98."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"You were still in high school?"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"My freshman year was '98 to '99."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Yeah, '99 was like--"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"I do think those are like interesting stages."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"When you first get to middle school,"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"when you first get to high school,"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"when you first get to college,"
01:25:45;01:25:50;"those kind of feel like moving up into degrees of consciousness."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"And then after college,"
01:25:51;01:25:55;"it's all just kind of like a-- melts into one endless nightmare."
01:25:55;01:25:59;"But I have actually very vivid memories of the summer of '98."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Spent a lot of time at my friend's house,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"and I think TRL was new."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"So we were watching Total Request Live,"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"and I felt like from ages 10 to 13,"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"I was kind of just like taking it all in, figuring [bleep] out,"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"and then I was like, ""Okay, '98. Summer '98."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Next year I'm entering high school."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"What's going on? Britney Spears."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Eminem. Eminem. Fastball."""
01:26:19;01:26:21;"It really did kind of felt like me entering high school"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"also was just like this new era of pop culture too."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"But maybe that's how you always feel."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"It's like you turn 14, and you're just kind of like,"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"""Okay, like what's up with the world?"""
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Yeah, because when you say that,"
01:26:32;01:26:35;"those are not big cultural moments. Fastball and--"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Okay, yeah, I was kidding about Fastball."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"No, I know that was a Britney Spears."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"No, no, Britney Spears and Eminem looking back, that was--"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Eminem? Okay, sure."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"That changed the world. Rap rock."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Well, I wouldn't say that."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"And then rap rock. So I remember like '98 to 2000,"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"I was very familiar with that time period, and I was like,"
01:26:50;01:26:51;"I was like, ""This is weird."""
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Were you into that stuff?"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"No, because I was already like a little hipster."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Right. Thank God, dude."
01:26:58;01:27:02;"Well, I definitely wasn't on some like, ""Britney Spears sucks."""
01:27:02;01:27:04;"No, no, I'm talking-- I'm not talking about Britney."
01:27:04;01:27:07;"I'm talking about Limp Bizkit and Slipknot."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"I made the best of it."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"Well, basically, I've always been kind of a straight shooter."
01:27:12;01:27:18;"The period where I was the biggest hater was like 6th grade."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Because, you know, I was 12. I was still a child."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"In the Jewish faith, you'd become a man at 13"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"when you're bar mitzvahed."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"But when I was 12, I still was a child."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"I hadn't put away childish things."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"I still had this kind of like chip on my shoulder about like,"
01:27:32;01:27:35;"""I'm into cool music, and I don't know what music you guys like,"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"but it sucks."""
01:27:36;01:27:39;"So for instance, there's a punk band from New Jersey"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"called The Bouncing Souls."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Are you familiar with them, Jake?"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"No."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"That's fair. That's a Jake not knowing something. That's fair."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"But Bouncing Souls are-- I think they're still a band,"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"a great band."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"They had like one or two albums that I just like thought were great."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"One of them was called Maniacal Laughter."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"And so I just loved Bouncing Souls."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"I love that they're from New Jersey."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I feel like they wore sambas a lot."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I don't know if they played soccer, but wearing sambas,"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Adidas sambas, was part of their aesthetic."
01:28:03;01:28:07;"And I was just like, ""The songs are great. I love this band."""
01:28:07;01:28:10;"And I bought a T-shirt from some mail-order catalog."
01:28:10;01:28:14;"It was a Bouncing Souls T-shirt that on the back said MTV"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"in like the anti-circle."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"Right, right, right."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Like MTV crossed out."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Like the Ghostbusters logo."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Yeah, anti-MTV."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"So some part of me-- you know, I was like 12,"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"so I was just kind of like, ""Well, I like Bouncing Souls,"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"and they're clearly anti-MTV, and I guess it makes sense"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"because they're an independent, samba-wearing,"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"New Jersey punk band."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"These are my people."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"They speak for me, and they don't like MTV."""
01:28:35;01:28:38;"And also, as discussed on the program, I didn't have MTV,"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"so I didn't feel like super loyal to it."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"I thought you were going to go the other way."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I thought you were going to say, ""Now hold on here."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"A band is part music and part image."""
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Right."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"And a band embracing having their image on TV"
01:28:50;01:28:53;"is not antithetical to the authenticity of their music."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"No, I wasn't there yet, man."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"I'm out with the Bouncing Souls now."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"No, no, no."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"No, no, okay."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"I would never be out with the Bouncing Souls."
01:28:58;01:29:02;"But like I said, I was 12, so I just kind of went along with it,"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"and I think it made me feel good to be like,"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"""Oh, kids in my school, they learn about music from MTV,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"but they don't even know about Bouncing Souls,"
01:29:09;01:29:12;"and here I am wearing a T-shirt that shows my solidarity"
01:29:12;01:29:16;"with the Bouncing Souls and shows that I don't like MTV."""
01:29:16;01:29:17;"You're legit."
01:29:17;01:29:20;"And, you know, again, in my small town,"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"it didn't really mean much."
01:29:21;01:29:24;"So I do remember somebody I was friendly with just being like,"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"""Hey, what's up with that shirt? What's wrong with MTV?"""
01:29:27;01:29:29;"And I just remember kind of like thinking about it,"
01:29:29;01:29:33;"and I felt like myself about to say whatever super--"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Talking point."
01:29:34;01:29:38;"--talking point to like, ""Well, MTV, they only play garbage,"" and blah, blah."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"And I just remember I kind of just like--"
01:29:40;01:29:44;"It was like almost the moment that I shifted into the person I am today,"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"and I was just kind of like, ""I don't know."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"These guys don't like MTV."""
01:29:47;01:29:49;"You're right. There's some good stuff on MTV."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"I didn't really have it in me."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"That's when Vampire Weekend started."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"And that's when Vampire Weekend started,"
01:29:53;01:29:57;"which is equal parts Bouncing Souls and equal parts mid-'90s MTV."
01:29:57;01:30:01;"And I think the truth is, of course, there's a lot of things wrong with MTV."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"At the time, you could be like, ""They're ignoring things that deserve it,"""
01:30:04;01:30:05;"and blah, blah."
01:30:05;01:30:09;"But when I really look back as an adult and I think about the fact that they like--"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"Well, this isn't about music, but the fact that they put on like"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Beavis and Butthead and Daria and like, you know,"
01:30:15;01:30:20;"the world Nirvana videos and helped popularize rap"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"to like kids who probably only listen to rock and like--"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"And, you know, they played a lot of good videos."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"I'm kind of like, ""I can't be that mad at it."""
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Like there's way worse things."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"But, you know."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"Yeah, looking back, '90s MTV is like a utopian--"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"[laughs]"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"--like college station, practically."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Right, and it got a lot worse, but, you know, whatever."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"No, no, no, that's terrible."
01:30:39;01:30:42;"And I still respect the Bouncing Souls for feeling that way."
01:30:42;01:30:46;"I just felt myself like about to say something that I didn't really like know if I felt."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"Right."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I'm a poser because even though I'm not--"
01:30:49;01:30:53;"I wasn't a big enough poser to wear a shirt from a band that I didn't listen to."""
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Right."
01:30:54;01:30:58;"I had too much self-respect for that, but I was a poser in that I was about to just like--"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"And you know what?"
01:30:59;01:31:02;"I'd like to think that the Bouncing Souls would have been proud of me for checking myself"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"and not just regurgitating their talking points"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"because they're an open-minded punk rock band."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"So anyway, that's all to say that age 12, 6th grade,"
01:31:10;01:31:13;"that was my peak kind of contrarianism."
01:31:13;01:31:17;"And then in 7th grade, I became kind of just like full music nerd"
01:31:17;01:31:21;"because I remember I got some gift certificates for my bar mitzvah."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"It's easy to remember."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"I guess it's easy to remember when you're Jewish, like your 13th birthday is such a big deal"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"because you do have to learn all this stuff."
01:31:28;01:31:32;"So I remember like I went to Tower Records in the city with like a family friend"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"and I got to buy all this--"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"And that's when I was like obsessed with like ska and reggae,"
01:31:37;01:31:40;"and I started getting new stuff in from the 60s and like I started getting into garage rock"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"and I got this compilation called Back From The Crypt Vol. 2."
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Very influential in my life."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"So anyway, that's when I just became like a music nerd"
01:31:48;01:31:52;"and then next summer, you know, now I'm 14 and seeing Britney Spears."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"And by that point, I was just like listening to too much music"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"to have like strong feelings about anything."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"So I was kind of like, Britney Spears, okay."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"Definitely didn't make me angry."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"I was kind of like, this is weird."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Kind of catchy."
01:32:04;01:32:08;"And then when all the new metal stuff hit, I was kind of like, huh, Limp Bizkit."
01:32:08;01:32:12;"Like, this is weird, but I kind of like the song that DJ--"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"I like the hip-hop side of it."
01:32:14;01:32:18;"Like there's a song DJ Premier produced, and I always liked System of a Down."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"So that's what I mean like I made the best of it."
01:32:20;01:32:23;"I was like, you know, when that stuff was playing everywhere, I'd be like,"
01:32:23;01:32:27;"okay, I'm not fully down with Limp Bizkit, and I don't think they're a great band,"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"but this is my favorite of their songs."
01:32:29;01:32:33;"And I do think the best band of this genre is System of a Down."
01:32:33;01:32:37;"I just didn't have like this kind of like, oh, this [bleep] sucks."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"You know, I was older."
01:32:39;01:32:40;"I was like, this [bleep] sucks."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"And I was right."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"Except for System."
01:32:42;01:32:46;"Yeah, System, I was like, okay, well, this is like mathy and kind of proggy."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"And also, I always loved Rage Against the Machine, too."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:32:49;01:32:50;"But so when that music hit--"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"But Rage is like '93 or '94."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"No, no, of course, they were the godfathers."
01:32:54;01:32:58;"But when that music hit, I saw how these were people who liked Rage,"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"and I couldn't fully hate on it."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"That first Rage record, dude."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"And the second one."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"Actually, Rage never made a bad album."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"Audioslave."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"I'm in, dude."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"I'm not even mad at Audioslave."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"I'm in on Audioslave."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Like a stone."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"That's a good song."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah, great song."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Like a stone is a good song."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"All right, let's get in this top five."
01:33:18;01:33:25;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:33:25;01:33:29;"So this week in '99, number five song, Smash Mouth All-Star."
01:33:29;01:33:42;"[MUSIC - SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR, ""SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR""]"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"It's kind of good production."
01:33:45;01:33:50;"[MUSIC - SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR, ""SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR""]"
01:33:50;01:33:55;"Oh, double track vocal comes in there."
01:33:55;01:33:59;"This song is so popular with kids now."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Still."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"Why?"
01:34:02;01:34:03;"It's still used in movies."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Was that on like Shrek or something?"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Yeah."
01:34:06;01:34:13;"[MUSIC - SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR, ""SMASH MOUTH ALL-STAR""]"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Wait, am I misremembering this?"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Did they play the Trump inauguration?"
01:34:17;01:34:18;"No, they're very anti-Trump."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Right, right."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"But that was like an internet joke or something"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"that people believed."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"See, I don't even remember it."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"It was like all--"
01:34:25;01:34:29;"No, they recently just like went hard on Trump on Twitter."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Oh, no, no."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Someone was covering this song, I think."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"Oh."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"Was that what it was?"
01:34:34;01:34:37;"Oh, it was Three Doors Down covering Smash Mouth."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"That is so deep."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Three Doors covered Smash Mouth?"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Smash Mouth."
01:34:42;01:34:44;"There's no way Smash Mouth [BLEEP] Three Doors."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"Three Doors."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"That band's brutal."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"I prefer Smash Mouth."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"I'm very diplomatic of you."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"No, Smash Mouth is cool."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"Where are they from?"
01:34:54;01:34:55;"What's their band?"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Definitely SoCal, right?"
01:34:56;01:34:57;"San Jose."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Oh, Northern California."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"Oh, wow, weird."
01:34:59;01:35:02;"How do you get a band going out of San Jose?"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Like, there's no like--"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"are you playing in San Francisco and Oakland a lot?"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"That's a major metropolitan area, man."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Yeah, but it's like--"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"it has very little like cultural impact."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Whoa."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"San Jose?"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"I feel like we just got another Connecticut situation on our hands."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"Jake just going in on a beloved place."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"I'm not going in on it."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"I don't think it's beloved."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Tell that to the Sharks fan."
01:35:25;01:35:31;"I think it's adjacent to Silicon Valley and like 45 miles from San Francisco."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"It's really not close to San Fran."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"It's probably 45 miles."
01:35:35;01:35:38;"Yeah, with traffic, it's like an hour and a half."
01:35:38;01:35:39;"Yeah, OK."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"Talk a little Bay Area."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"You got that 101 corridor through Redwood City."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Yeah, you spend much time in San Jose when you used to live up there?"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"No."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"You've never been to the Winchester Mystery House?"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"No, I never have."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"Well, I have."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"Have you?"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"And it's very spooky."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"I'm not ripping in San Jose."
01:35:56;01:36:00;"I'm saying for a city of that size in that part of the world--"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"This guy's ripping on San Jose."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"--in Northern California, it's a bit of a ghost, man."
01:36:04;01:36:08;"I'm just wondering how Smash Mouth got their career going out of San Jose."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"I'm just intrigued by those mechanics."
01:36:10;01:36:14;"I think it's the same as in any major metropolitan area."
01:36:14;01:36:18;"They're not from like a one stoplight town in West Texas, you know."
01:36:18;01:36:21;"San Jose, you're talking about a thriving metropolitan area."
01:36:21;01:36:25;"I'm sure there were many clubs, organizations, places for them to play."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Organizations."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"And yeah, I bet they probably ripped up to the Bay--"
01:36:30;01:36:31;"Well, I guess they are the Bay."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"Yeah, yeah."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"North Bay."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"They ripped up to San Fran."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"Do you think Smash Mouth ever played at-- what's the punk club in--"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Oh, Gilman?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Gilman."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"Gilman Street in Berkeley?"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"That's actually a good question."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Early Smash Mouth gigs."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"I bet they did."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"You also got to assume bands like Smash Mouth, when they came out,"
01:36:47;01:36:51;"because their first set was, ""You might as well be walking on the sun."""
01:36:51;01:36:55;"They were like a little more Hawaiian shirts, rockabilly."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Yeah."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"They seem very SoCal."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Very Orange County."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"But guys like that always have roots in punk rock."
01:37:02;01:37:06;"You don't turn into like a Hawaiian shirt guy unless you start with punk rock."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"It's so true, dude."
01:37:07;01:37:11;"I went through that transition from 6th to 7th grade."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"Exotica."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"You familiar with what people call Exotica?"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"No."
01:37:15;01:37:19;"Around the time that there was this kind of surf-- and I always loved surf music."
01:37:19;01:37:22;"I always buy like obscure '60s surf records."
01:37:22;01:37:26;"Around the time there was kind of a surf and garage revival in the '90s,"
01:37:26;01:37:33;"there was also a renewed interest in music made by people like Esquivel and Martin Denny."
01:37:33;01:37:36;"It was like related to big band music and sometimes Latin music."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"Yeah, it was kind of like Hawaiian shirt, hi-fi music,"
01:37:39;01:37:44;"like a record to put on while you made like Mai Tais in your suburban basement bar."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"You can picture what that stuff sounds like."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Life's good, man."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Like Oregon music."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"Oh, yeah."
01:37:48;01:37:53;"Kind of slightly creepy, vibey, Hawaiian shirt Mai Tai music."
01:37:53;01:37:57;"And so anyway, in a lot of these magazines and catalogs that would cover it,"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"it would always be featuring the best surf, garage, and Exotica."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"I'm sure the Smash Mouth guys know what I'm talking about."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"So did Smash Mouth--"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"Ever play Gilman Street?"
01:38:05;01:38:09;"Ever play Gilman-- and what's it called, 624 Gilman?"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"I thought it was just called Gilman Street."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"924 Gilman?"
01:38:12;01:38:16;"Ever cross paths-- well, I guess at that point Green Day was already really big."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Play a show with Rancid or something?"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"If they did, the Internet doesn't remember it."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Maybe it was such a thriving scene in San Jose."
01:38:23;01:38:26;"By the way, Seinfeld, this is a true number crunch."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:27;01:38:31;"So Jake's talking about San Jose like it's some podunk town."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"Where does San Jose fall in terms of the size of American cities?"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"Is it top 10?"
01:38:36;01:38:37;"I bet it's right--"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"Oh, I don't think so."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"I bet it's right at number 10."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"10 or 11 or 9 or--"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"You think you know American cities that well, Seinfeld?"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Yeah."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"I mean, I would vouch that it's not--"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"I bet it's the second biggest city in California."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"Oh, my God."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"It's number 10."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"It's number 10?"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Called it, dude."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"It's the 10th biggest city in America?"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"Well, because it's definitely bigger than-- San Francisco's a small city."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"Wow."
01:38:57;01:38:58;"Yeah, San Francisco's 700,000."
01:38:58;01:39:01;"It's just over a million people."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Second to Dallas, Texas."
01:39:03;01:39:07;"Oh, Dallas, you shine with an evil light."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"You mean Dallas is number 9?"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"Dallas is number 9."
01:39:09;01:39:13;"Well, anyway, I want to get some of the Smash Mouth guys on."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"You know who knows them from back in the days?"
01:39:15;01:39:20;"Ariel, because Ariel's '90s band, the Hippos, like toured with them or something."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Oh, wow."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"Anyway, I always like Smash Mouth."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"Where are we?"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"That's number 5."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Okay."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"We got to pick up the pace."
01:39:27;01:39:31;"Number 5 of 99, number 5 today, Hot Girl Summer featuring Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"This is Megan Thee Stallion."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"This song is called Hot Girl Summer?"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Yeah."
01:39:43;01:39:44;"I've seen this reference on Twitter."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"Yeah, yeah, right."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"It's a big reference now."
01:39:46;01:39:51;"It's like-- I think Megan Thee Stallion popularized the phrase and then made the song."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Is that the right sentence?"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"That's correct, yeah."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"What is the artist's name?"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"Megan Thee Stallion."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"Megan Thee Stallion?"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Well, it's T-H-E-E."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Yeah, Megan."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Thee."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Like M-E-G-A-N."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Yep."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"V."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Stallion."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"Oh, V."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"She would talk a lot about Hot Girl Sh*t and then it became Hot Girl Summer and then it"
01:40:18;01:40:23;"became a thing that a lot of people would use as like a hashtag almost."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"And she's applied to trademark."
01:40:25;01:40:26;"Right."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"I've seen that on Twitter."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"I'm glad the songs do well."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"I like the idea of a summer having a theme though."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Right."
01:40:32;01:40:33;"That's fun."
01:40:33;01:40:36;"Like, wait, Seinfeld, you must have done a Summer of George Hot Girl Summer event."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"I did do a Hot Girl Summer of George tweet."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"Okay, there you go."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Yeah."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"Well, yeah, didn't you have a Grateful Dead summer?"
01:40:41;01:40:46;"I had-- yeah, me and my buddy Steve, when we were roommates back in like 2000 in Portland,"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"we had a Grateful Dead summer."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"We had a Led Zeppelin summer."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"And then we had a Cooler in the Car summer."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"What does that mean?"
01:40:54;01:40:59;"Like if you show up to a buddy's house, there's a cooler of brew in the car."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"At all times?"
01:41:00;01:41:01;"At all times."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"Yes."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"And how does one have--"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"So you would always keep it in there."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"Yeah, it was always a cooler of brew."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"So you're always just filling it with ice?"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"Yeah."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"Get a lot of melted water situations."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Yes."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"Just you doing this or this is a good community thing?"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Yeah, small community."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Hot Girl Summer."
01:41:16;01:41:19;"In my day, it was Cooler of Brew in the Car Summer."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"What happened?"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Cooler Summer."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"What's a good like TC summer theme?"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"I don't want it to be some gross food."
01:41:27;01:41:28;"I don't know."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"Maybe just getting older."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"My mind just goes to like health-related things."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"Right."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Vegan summer."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"Right, right, yeah."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"It's also the election year, right?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Summer of push-ups."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Let's abstain from things."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Summer of Bernie."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"And put ourselves through--"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"No Fap Summer."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Physical exertion."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"[laughter]"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"What is it?"
01:41:45;01:41:46;"No Fap Summer?"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"No Fap?"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Oh, God, this is a crazy episode."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Jake, you're not familiar with the No Fap movement?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"No, what's that?"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Wait, F-A-P?"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"Yeah."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"God, I feel like a grandpa."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"I'm just like, ""What is-- who is this?"""
01:41:57;01:42:00;"Fap is internet slang for masturbation."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Whoa, wait."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"I think it's onomatopoeia."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"What's the derivation?"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Wait."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"Onomatopoeia."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Oh, okay, gotcha."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"So anyway, there's been a movement for a long time"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"where people claim that there's health benefits,"
01:42:11;01:42:15;"mental clarity, things like that, to abstaining from--"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Not mental clarity."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"It would be mentally clouding."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"There's an argument to the opposite effect,"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"that it focuses you up and makes you more attractive"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"to the opposite sex."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"I don't think it focuses you up."
01:42:25;01:42:26;"All right, Jake, you're the jink."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"I think it deludes you."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"I think it makes you insane."
01:42:28;01:42:31;"Right, but Jake, you don't know what you're walking into here."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"These are passionate community of people"
01:42:34;01:42:38;"who've spent years doing their own research on this,"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"and they feel very strongly about this,"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"so you're walking into a minefield right now."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"So how long would they go?"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Some people have gone years."
01:42:45;01:42:48;"Are they having sex, or is it just no--"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"I think you can have sex,"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"but some people abstain from sex, too."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"I think the goal's forever."
01:42:52;01:42:55;"Well, it's also like, ""Fine, be my guest."
01:42:55;01:42:56;"""Don't [bleep] me."""
01:42:56;01:42:58;"Great. Good for you."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"So you're fine with it."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"Well, they don't need your--"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"I just don't understand--"
01:43:01;01:43:06;"Jake, I don't think they need your kind of condescending praise."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"These guys are at such a high level mentally that--"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Yeah, but I don't need them dictating to me"
01:43:11;01:43:14;"how to achieve mental clarity."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"It's like, you do you."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"You don't have to attach all these other--"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"I don't know if they're fascists about it."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"I don't know if they want to impose it."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"They probably feel bad for you."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"And you."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"I'm a member of the community, Jake."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"Yeah, look, mask off."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"You know what?"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"How do you think I achieved this level of mental clarity?"
01:43:30;01:43:33;"You are very lucid today on the program."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"Yeah."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"I want to make this show better."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"New rules."
01:43:37;01:43:39;"Summer, fall, winter, spring."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"No pizza, no brew."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Where does all this stuff take place, Seinfeld?"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"It's all on Reddit?"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Reddit."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"I was reading about NoFap about a week ago, actually."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Were you?"
01:43:47;01:43:50;"I was, yeah, because I was looking for clarity."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"And it originated on Reddit,"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"and then it actually became so popular, the subreddit,"
01:43:54;01:43:57;"that I believe it branched out into its own thing."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Oh, it's like its own Reddit with subreddits"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"within the NoFap community?"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"I think it broke out."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"Okay."
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Yeah."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Well, Jake, give it a try for the next two weeks"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"and report back for the next TC."
01:44:07;01:44:10;"Jake comes in here in two weeks just like walking on air,"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"super mental clarity, just like, you know, guys,"
01:44:13;01:44:17;"I used to do a cooler summer, and I bruised my friends."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Man, I don't know what I was missing."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"This is what it's all about, fellas."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"The number four song in 99, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"""

01:50:59;01:51:01;"is absolutely disgusting."""
01:51:01;01:51:05;"I'm willing to believe that he's impressionistically referencing"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"like a time that summer when he got sick from eating too much Chinese food."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"The one spot at the strip mall, Chinese."

01:51:39;01:51:41;"You ever read Proust, Jake?"
01:51:41;01:51:45;"No, I'm heavy on Nosgaard, who's compared to Proust."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Yeah."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"But Nosgaard's contemporary, so I gravitate to him."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Yeah, one summer off."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"We should do Summer of Proust."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"Oh, dude."

01:51:59;01:52:01;"Marcel Proust makes me sick."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"'Cause Dave Makovich from Chromia, you know,"
01:52:03;01:52:07;"he studied French literature, so he's always talking about Proust."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"I did not know that."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"I think the writers of the song, they understand that"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"you can't sum up the past in a tidy way,"
01:52:13;01:52:16;"so immediately they're letting us know that this is an impressionistic song."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits."
01:52:18;01:52:22;"So you're like, okay, is this going to be like a CNN look back at 1990?"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits."
01:52:24;01:52:27;"George H.W. Bush was in the White House."

01:52:35;01:52:38;"They're mixing this kind of grand cultural thing,"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"what was playing on the radio, with this very specific,"
01:52:41;01:52:44;"problematic remembrance of a time Chinese food made him sick."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"And then he twists it yet again."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"And I think it's Fly When Girls Stop By For The Summer."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Stop by?"
01:52:51;01:52:52;"Maybe he's like a townie."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"Oh, yeah, it's like a summer relationship."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"It's like a summer fling."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"He's a townie in a lake town."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"The rich girls from the suburbs coming up."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"Yeah."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"There's the small town Chinese restaurant."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Yeah, he's a lake townie."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"The rich suburban girls come."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"He's working the landscaping gig in the summer."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"Yeah."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"Oh, and maybe when he says the Chinese food makes him sick,"
01:53:12;01:53:17;"again, he wouldn't dream of impugning the quality of one of the world's"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"great cuisine cultures."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"He's just saying, you know what?"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"I'm not a member of the country club."
01:53:21;01:53:25;"I can't go, you know, eat club sandwiches at the country club."
01:53:25;01:53:29;"So I had to use my meager paycheck to go to the worst Chinese restaurant in"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"town."
01:53:30;01:53:31;"And it made me sick."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"That's before the Panda opened."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Yeah, we didn't have Panda Express."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"I know in your rich suburb, you'd probably go eat Panda Express at the mall."
01:53:38;01:53:41;"Here, in a lake town, it's not like that."
01:53:41;01:53:44;"We have one really bad Chinese restaurant."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"Again, rich suburban mall girls."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"They eat Panda Express."
01:53:51;01:53:52;"It's not going to make you sick."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"It's going to make you feel good."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"And they wear Abercrombie and Fitch."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"It makes you feel great."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"I'd take her if I had one wish, but she's been gone since that summer."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"You know, it tracks."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"It really tracks."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"He's a working class lake townie."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Search and quotes lake townie."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Is that a thing?"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"It's got to be."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"There's all different types of townies, but a lake townie?"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Yeah."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"Summer girls."
01:54:15;01:54:22;"So I found the phrase lake townie in the Hartford Courant in a review of the film Beethoven from 1993."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Uh-huh."
01:54:23;01:54:29;"Referring to a motorcycling lake townie named Seth."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"[Laughter]"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Played by a young Danny Masterson."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Oh, wow."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"And then there's also the show Riverdale."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"More contemporary."
01:54:37;01:54:43;"Yeah, and Riverdale is set in Shadow Lake, and so they refer to this character Cassidy as a townie."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"So Shadow Lake townie Cassidy."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"She's a lake townie."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Whoa."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Hip-hop mama, spick and span, met you one summer and it all began."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"You're the best girl that I ever did see."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"The great Larry Bird, Jersey 33."

01:55:03;01:55:05;"Something in your eyes really drove me crazy."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Let's listen to the rest of the song."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"This song's just hitting."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"What do you think of these little tasty guitar moments, Jake?"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Pretty in."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"We're down in it."
01:55:16;01:55:20;"Summer so-so, summertime feels got it going on."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Shake and wiggle to a hip-hop song."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Ezra, you should cover this."
01:55:24;01:55:28;"Well, I'll admit, I don't love the rap verses."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"Oh, classic."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"I steal your honey like I steal your butt."
01:55:31;01:55:35;"And I think it's fly when girls start fighting for the summer."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"For the summertime."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"I like girls that wear every crime being fair."
01:55:40;01:55:45;"I like the, like, sustained synth strings that glow in the mix."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Yeah, it's pretty."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"Kind of abrupt ending."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"Summer's over."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"That's how it ends, dude."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Beautiful song, man."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"I'm glad to hear that one."
01:55:58;01:56:02;"The number three song this summer, ""Truth Hurts"" by Lizzo."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Oh, yeah, we heard this last time."
01:56:17;01:56:20;"On our fact sheet, we got a quote from Lizzo that says,"
01:56:20;01:56:24;"""I was in marching band from eighth grade all the way up until college,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"the Cougar Marching Band at University of Houston."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"I was a piccolo player."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"I was the baddest piccolo in the land because I got big lungs"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"and I was really determined."
01:56:31;01:56:34;"I was in marching band, too, in high school."""
01:56:34;01:56:36;"I think Lizzo was on fresh air."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"I mean, she's huge right now."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"With Terry Grylls."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"All over the place."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"Did you come across Lizzo when you played at Mo-Pop Festival?"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"Lizzo played right before us at Mo-Pop, and, yeah,"
01:56:46;01:56:51;"we were kind of, like, standing around on the lake, actually."
01:56:51;01:56:54;"The backstage was, like, this kind of nice grass area right on the lake."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"You could see Canada very clearly."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"I want to get back to '99."
01:56:58;01:57:01;"That summer, girls, just got me in a nostalgic mood."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"The number two song, ""Enrique Iglesias."""

01:57:37;01:57:39;"Joe Walsh came in kind of through those leads."

01:57:48;01:57:50;"Kind of gives me, like, an Ace of Bass vibe."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"Oh, yeah, totally."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"That rhythm."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Was this the same year as Smooth?"
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Yeah, '99."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"Carlos Santana."
01:57:57;01:58:00;"'99, we had Ricky Martin, ""Livin' La Vida Loca,"" this song,"

01:58:29;01:58:33;"Yeah, it's like they knew the 20th century was ending, and--"
01:58:33;01:58:35;"The pre-millennium tension."
01:58:35;01:58:38;"We were going to enter some dark days."
01:58:38;01:58:42;"[playing guitar]"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"Great song."

01:58:57;01:58:58;"Yeah, it's very similar."
01:58:58;01:59:01;"The number two song on iTunes right now."

01:59:02;01:59:04;"[playing guitar]"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Another kind of melancholic song."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"Oh, my God."
01:59:07;01:59:08;"Oh, but two."
01:59:08;01:59:09;"Yeah, number two."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"We don't know number one."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"Well, probably the other dumb version of this song"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"is going to be number one."
01:59:13;01:59:14;"I'm sick of it."
01:59:14;01:59:15;"The backlash has started."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"It's runners over."

01:59:22;01:59:25;"Have you heard the Mason Ramsey verse on the remix of this?"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"Once."
01:59:27;01:59:29;"It's pretty good."
01:59:29;01:59:31;"Who's Mason Ramsey?"
01:59:31;01:59:34;"Walmart Yodel Boy."
01:59:34;01:59:36;"Yeah, don't worry about it."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"Of course, going to move on."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"All right."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"We've covered it."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"Now, the number one song in 1999."
01:59:41;01:59:44;"This is a song I actually-- I always really liked, actually."
01:59:44;01:59:47;"Again, I don't know if it's because I was 14--"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"well, I guess I was 15, actually, summer '99."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"So it's 15, summer '99."
01:59:51;01:59:54;"And so all these songs just really hit me with this nostalgia,"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"maybe because it was like, yeah, I just finished my freshman year,"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"and it's like going into sophomore year, like, this [bleep] is heating up, man."
01:59:59;02:00:03;"This is a funny era for ""Days Between"" because I was 22."
02:00:03;02:00:04;"You're done with college."
02:00:04;02:00:08;"Just like 22-year-old Jake hanging out with a 15-year-old Ezra."
02:00:08;02:00:10;"We probably still-- we probably would have plenty of time."
02:00:10;02:00:11;"I bet we would."
02:00:11;02:00:12;"Yeah, wouldn't have happened."
02:00:12;02:00:13;"It'd probably be a pretty cool hang."
02:00:13;02:00:16;"This is where the ""Days Between"" in terms of how you feel about music changes."
02:00:16;02:00:19;"Between 12-- I wouldn't even go all the way up to 18."
02:00:19;02:00:21;"I'd say between 12 and 15."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"Once you're 16, it's like-- I don't know."
02:00:23;02:00:24;"Things change."
02:00:24;02:00:27;"But between 12 and 15, it's just like--"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"You know what was huge?"
02:00:29;02:00:32;"I can't say if it was number one or not, but huge when I was 14."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"What?"
02:00:33;02:00:34;"""Smells Like Teen Spirit."""
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Ah."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"Straight up."
02:00:36;02:00:38;"Yeah, see, I never got to hear that song anew, really."
02:00:38;02:00:41;"I mean, it's just like so-- I'm just like so perfectly of that age."
02:00:41;02:00:45;"Yeah, there was no cool rock music when I was coming of age."
02:00:45;02:00:49;"And then the Strokes came out and the White Stripes when I was 17."
02:00:49;02:00:50;"And so I liked it."
02:00:50;02:00:51;"That's pretty good."
02:00:51;02:00:54;"No, no, it was good, but I was already like-- I don't know how to put it."
02:00:54;02:00:55;"Between 11--"
02:00:55;02:00:56;"I was over it, man."
02:00:56;02:00:58;"I was a little bit over it."
02:00:58;02:00:59;"And I love those bands."
02:00:59;02:01:00;"Sure."
02:01:00;02:01:05;"I just already was kind of like-- I didn't have the wide-eyed love of music anymore."
02:01:05;02:01:07;"I was just kind of like on some other [bleep]"
02:01:07;02:01:10;"Strokes were like, ""Yeah, yeah, I've heard Lou Reed on television."
02:01:10;02:01:11;"Yeah, it's great."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"I like what you guys are doing."""
02:01:12;02:01:14;"No, I was like, ""These guys are great."
02:01:14;02:01:15;"I love them."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"I want to study their songs and see what they're doing."""
02:01:17;02:01:20;"But I think I already was like-- it already fired me up to start my own band."
02:01:20;02:01:28;"I wasn't like a wide-eyed kid just taking music in and thinking about my crushes"
02:01:28;02:01:31;"and like, ""Wow, what's high school going to be like?"""
02:01:31;02:01:32;"It's just such a different time."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"And then you're like--"
02:01:33;02:01:34;"You were already attached."
02:01:34;02:01:37;"I was like 17 and I was kind of like, ""All right, Strokes."
02:01:37;02:01:38;"Okay, excellent song."""
02:01:38;02:01:42;"I was almost on some early professionalism [bleep]"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"where I was like, ""Well done, fellas."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"Okay, interesting."""
02:01:46;02:01:47;"Noted."
02:01:47;02:01:49;"Noted, yeah."
02:01:49;02:01:52;"The competition has come strong."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"The gauntlet has been thrown."
02:01:54;02:01:55;"And it wasn't even that strong."
02:01:55;02:01:59;"I actually remember me and Wes's band, our high school band,"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"we would mess around and play someday."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"And I just remember learning how to play those chords."
02:02:03;02:02:04;"And I was like, ""Oh, this is cool."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"I like what they did."""
02:02:06;02:02:08;"It was kind of the first time when a band came out,"
02:02:08;02:02:11;"and I was just very familiar with the references already"
02:02:11;02:02:15;"because that was also extremely my [bleep] was television and Velvet Underground."
02:02:15;02:02:17;"So I totally loved it."
02:02:17;02:02:18;"Yeah, I don't know how to explain it, though."
02:02:18;02:02:19;"It's just like--"
02:02:19;02:02:20;"No, I get it."
02:02:20;02:02:23;"I think when you're a little kid, obviously everything is just washing over you."
02:02:23;02:02:24;"Yeah."
02:02:24;02:02:29;"But then there's something about that tween-age, early teen years that's just very unique."
02:02:29;02:02:32;"I think you're just learning the archetypes at that age."
02:02:32;02:02:38;"And then you start to understand, like, oh, people are influenced by things."
02:02:38;02:02:40;"They build off of other things."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"It's not as--"
02:02:41;02:02:44;"And with each successive generation of music, you learn about--"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"It's a little less magical or something."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"And again, it doesn't mean you don't respect it or you don't like it"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"because I love the strokes."
02:02:51;02:02:53;"You're like, ""I see the structure. I get it."""
02:02:53;02:02:54;"It was just different."
02:02:54;02:02:59;"But this music just reminds me of passively being those ages"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"and just kind of being like--"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"I would actually say the summer after my freshman year,"
02:03:03;02:03:06;"I would say was like my last summer of childhood."
02:03:06;02:03:07;"Damn, dude."
02:03:07;02:03:10;"I just remember that summer still kind of like--"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"I don't know--going on like trampolines."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"And obviously things were changing."
02:03:14;02:03:16;"People were having like boyfriends and girlfriends."
02:03:16;02:03:18;"And there were definitely some like--"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"It's not the same as being 11."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"But I just do remember after that summer, for whatever reason,"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"my sophomore year just sucked."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"I didn't like it that much."
02:03:26;02:03:30;"The first time I ever got super high and drunk was my sophomore year."
02:03:30;02:03:32;"I just felt like--"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"I got a little drunk in freshman year and maybe in eighth grade."
02:03:34;02:03:37;"But just the first time I got super stoned like, ""Whoa, what the [bleep]"
02:03:37;02:03:40;"That was crazy,"" was my sophomore year."
02:03:40;02:03:44;"So there's something about--this music reminds me of truly the final era"
02:03:44;02:03:47;"before I turn into the jaded person that I am today."
02:03:47;02:03:52;"[singing]"
02:03:52;02:03:55;"I do remember kind of being like--"
02:03:55;02:03:58;"I know this song so well because it was so popular at the time."
02:03:58;02:04:00;"I'm curious what it's going to be."
02:04:00;02:04:02;"The beginning of it I truly find haunting too."
02:04:02;02:04:03;"Am I going to know it?"
02:04:03;02:04:04;"I think so."
02:04:04;02:04:05;"I mean if I know the Ricky Martin--"
02:04:05;02:04:08;"I don't really like the chorus, but the intro and the verse--"
02:04:08;02:04:10;"I just remember the first time hearing it being like, ""Whoa."""
02:04:10;02:04:11;"Aguilera?"
02:04:11;02:04:12;"Yes."
02:04:12;02:04:14;"How did I know that? ""Genie in a Bottle""?"
02:04:16;02:04:17;"Like this is so weird."
02:04:17;02:04:18;"Yeah, this is--wow."
02:04:18;02:04:21;"This being like a huge song when you're 14."
02:04:21;02:04:23;"It's actually early--"
02:04:23;02:04:24;"It's before Kid A."
02:04:24;02:04:27;"Radiohead wasn't up on this yet."
02:04:27;02:04:28;"Even just like--"
02:04:28;02:04:29;"Wait, start it again."
02:04:29;02:04:31;"The piano is pretty Swedish."
02:04:31;02:04:32;"Yeah, but then--"
02:04:32;02:04:34;"And then just kind of detuned."
02:04:34;02:04:35;"[imitates piano]"
02:04:37;02:04:39;"So minimal."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"I always found this haunting."
02:04:40;02:04:41;"I was just like--"
02:04:41;02:04:44;"If this song came out today, do you think it would still hit?"
02:04:44;02:04:47;"Yes, absolutely."
02:04:47;02:04:48;"Strong writing."
02:05:08;02:05:11;"It's like the pre-chorus, ""Starting to lose me."""
02:05:22;02:05:26;"Yeah, corny chorus, but that verse is very minor."
02:05:26;02:05:30;"The verse is almost like a weird Don Henley song or something."
02:05:30;02:05:31;"Yeah."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"""Boys of Summer"" vibes."
02:05:33;02:05:35;"The drum programming is crazy."
02:05:40;02:05:41;"This part."
02:05:46;02:05:48;"This is a deep memory."
02:05:48;02:05:52;"This song reminds me of Summer '99."
02:05:52;02:05:53;"Yeah."
02:05:53;02:05:56;"I had a weird temp job for about a month"
02:05:56;02:06:02;"where I was representing Sprint PCS at--"
02:06:02;02:06:05;"[laughter]"
02:06:05;02:06:07;"This is so pathetic."
02:06:07;02:06:14;"At kiosks inside Circuit Cities in Kmart."
02:06:14;02:06:15;"And so I remember--"
02:06:15;02:06:17;"Polo shirt tucked into khakis."
02:06:17;02:06:19;"""Sir, can I interest you?"
02:06:19;02:06:20;"Can I talk to you?"""
02:06:20;02:06:22;"Like a brochure about Sprint PCS."
02:06:22;02:06:24;"How old were you?"
02:06:24;02:06:26;"22, man."
02:06:26;02:06:29;"It was literally a month after graduating college."
02:06:29;02:06:30;"What am I doing?"
02:06:30;02:06:34;"I'm just like, ""I need to make a little money, pay some rent."""
02:06:34;02:06:37;"So I remember being in the Circuit City,"
02:06:37;02:06:40;"standing by the kiosk, not really trying,"
02:06:40;02:06:45;"although you would get $5 sales commission if you sold a phone."
02:06:45;02:06:48;"I would maybe sell like two or three a day."
02:06:48;02:06:51;"Four or five hour shift, shorter shift."
02:06:51;02:06:54;"Maybe you're getting paid like 10 an hour."
02:06:54;02:06:57;"But this song I remember playing a lot,"
02:06:57;02:07:01;"and then I remember hearing it for like the third time that day,"
02:07:01;02:07:04;"and I was sitting there just like, ""Man, can I talk to you?"""
02:07:04;02:07:06;"And then there was like a giant--"
02:07:06;02:07:09;"The Circuit City would sell tons of CDs back then."
02:07:09;02:07:13;"So I remember actually going over to like a CD listening station"
02:07:13;02:07:15;"and literally throwing on--"
02:07:15;02:07:18;"There was a headphone setup with Eagles' greatest hits."
02:07:18;02:07:21;"And I was like, ""I'm just going to tap out"
02:07:21;02:07:25;"on this insane corporate retail environment for a little bit"
