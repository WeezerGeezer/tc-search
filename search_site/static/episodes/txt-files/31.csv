00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis is back."
00:02;00:04;"The election's over."
00:04;00:06;"We got a lot to talk about."
00:06;00:09;"Nobody respects women more than I do."
00:09;00:10;"Good lord."
00:10;00:13;"On this episode, Jake and I will be"
00:13;00:16;"talking about our feelings, looking towards the future,"
00:16;00:19;"but also paying tribute to Leonard Cohen,"
00:19;00:22;"a great songwriter who passed away at 82."
00:22;00:25;"All this, plus Lay's potato chips."
00:25;00:27;"This is..."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:35;00:37;"They passed me by"
00:37;00:41;"All of those great romances"
00:41;00:44;"The war I felt, warming me"
00:44;00:48;"All my rightful chances"
00:48;00:50;"My picture clear"
00:50;00:55;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:55;00:59;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:59;01:02;"When the bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:09;"Have you listened to the new Leonard Cohen album?"
01:09;01:10;"No."
01:10;01:12;"This is track one of his last album."
01:12;01:14;"When did it come out?"
01:14;01:15;"A month ago."
01:15;01:17;"Kind of Bowie style."
01:17;01:18;"Do you think he knew he was dying?"
01:18;01:20;"Yeah."
01:20;01:23;"Wow, it's crazy, twice in one year doing that."
01:23;01:26;"He did an interview where he said he was going to die."
01:26;01:28;"And then people were like, ""What?"""
01:28;01:30;"And he was like, ""No, I mean..."""
01:30;01:32;"I mean, eventually."
01:32;01:36;"If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game"
01:36;01:40;"If you are the healer, means I'm broken and lame"
01:40;01:45;"If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame"
01:45;01:50;"You want it darker, we kill the flame"
01:50;02:02;"Magnified, sanctified be thy holy name"
02:02;02:06;"Vilified, crucified in the human frame"
02:06;02:11;"A million candles burning for the help that never came"
02:11;02:13;"You want it darker"
02:14;02:23;"Hineni, Hineni"
02:23;02:25;"I'm ready, my lord."
02:25;02:26;"I'm ready, my lord."
02:26;02:28;"What did he say before that?"
02:28;02:31;"It's like Hebrew, Hineni means I'm here."
02:31;02:33;"Which I guess is what Isaac said to God."
02:33;02:37;"There's a lover in the story, but the story's still the same"
02:37;02:42;"There's a lullaby for suffering and a paradox to blame"
02:42;02:47;"But it's written in the scriptures and it's not some idle claim"
02:47;02:52;"You want it darker, we kill the flame"
02:52;03:04;"They're lining up the prisoners and the guards to take an aim"
03:04;03:08;"I struggled with some demons, they were middle class and tame"
03:08;03:13;"I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim"
03:13;03:15;"You want it darker"
03:15;03:24;"Hineni, Hineni"
03:24;03:27;"I'm ready, my lord."
03:30;03:48;"Magnified, sanctified be thy holy name"
03:48;03:52;"Vilified, crucified in the human frame"
03:52;03:57;"A million candles burning for the love that never came"
03:57;04:02;"You want it darker, we kill the flame"
04:02;04:14;"If you are the dealer, let me out of the game"
04:14;04:19;"If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame"
04:19;04:24;"If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame"
04:24;04:26;"You want it darker"
04:26;04:36;"Hineni, Hineni"
04:36;04:44;"Hineni, Hineni"
04:44;04:47;"I'm ready, my lord."
04:47;04:51;"That was Leonard Cohen with ""You Want It Darker."""
04:51;04:55;"R.I.P. We'll be talking about him a lot later."
04:55;05:03;"Welcome back to Time Crisis, the first time crisis since Donald Trump was elected."
05:03;05:06;"That sounds crazy, even you saying that."
05:06;05:10;"Yeah, I'm kind of getting used to it. I mean, getting used to the concept that it's real."
05:10;05:12;"President Trump!"
05:12;05:14;"It's already President-elect Trump."
05:14;05:18;"We were talking two weeks ago about this upcoming election,"
05:18;05:21;"wondering what was going to happen."
05:21;05:23;"I was in a terrible headspace."
05:23;05:24;"Yeah, man, you were--"
05:24;05:25;"I was really stressed out."
05:25;05:28;"You were stressed out. I'll admit, I wasn't as stressed out as I should have been."
05:28;05:32;"I trusted the polls. I thought it was very unlikely that he was going to win."
05:32;05:38;"Right. Well, I mean, it was like at 538, it was 70-30 going in, so that's--"
05:38;05:39;"But that was also--"
05:39;05:40;"One in three chance, basically."
05:40;05:44;"That was also the most optimistic. New York Times has given him like 7% and stuff."
05:44;05:47;"But first of all, that's how likelihoods work."
05:47;05:50;"Somebody made the point to me that it's irresponsible to--"
05:50;05:54;"rather than just showing people the polls and doing a poll of polls,"
05:54;05:59;"when you start doing likelihood percentages, the average person is not great at that."
05:59;06:05;"It's kind of like when you look at something at 70-30, you should be terrified"
06:05;06:08;"because that means essentially there's a one in three chance it's going to happen."
06:08;06:12;"But sometimes you look at when somebody says it's 70-30, and you're just like,"
06:12;06:14;"""70, C-minus, decent."""
06:14;06:15;"Yeah."
06:15;06:17;"It's like you almost turn it into a number."
06:17;06:21;"But think about putting two bullets into a six-shot revolver."
06:21;06:22;"And then playing Russian roulette?"
06:22;06:23;"Yeah."
06:23;06:24;"I'm not doing that."
06:24;06:27;"No. That's basically what we were doing."
06:27;06:30;"Yeah. Even one in 100 is brutal."
06:30;06:33;"Would you fly on an airplane if you knew there's a one in 100 chance of--"
06:33;06:34;"No."
06:34;06:37;"--of not having good entertainment options on that aircraft?"
06:37;06:39;"I might roll the dice with that."
06:39;06:41;"What if you knew that the seat wouldn't recline?"
06:41;06:42;"I don't know--"
06:42;06:43;"Okay, this is a bad metaphor."
06:43;06:46;"I don't know about your socioeconomic class here, dude."
06:46;06:48;"I'm flying coach."
06:48;06:50;"I've never flown first class in my life."
06:50;06:51;"Oh, really?"
06:51;06:55;"I know you're across the table from me in more ways than one."
06:55;06:57;"Rich rock star over here."
06:57;06:58;"First of all--"
06:58;07:00;"The working people of this country--"
07:00;07:04;"--country do not fly first class."
07:04;07:05;"No."
07:05;07:08;"A lot of people think that I fly first class everywhere."
07:08;07:11;"Of course, I've flown first class many times."
07:11;07:15;"When I've been the guest of royalty or something flying me somewhere."
07:15;07:16;"But when I book--"
07:16;07:17;"Royalty?"
07:17;07:20;"Or when I'm going to play a corporate gig."
07:20;07:21;"Yeah."
07:21;07:22;"When I'm playing the Doritos--"
07:22;07:23;"I want some of those."
07:23;07:26;"--fun tent in Dubai, of course they're going to fly me first class."
07:26;07:30;"But when I book my own flights, I probably always fly coach."
07:30;07:31;"Right."
07:31;07:32;"Because who cares?"
07:32;07:33;"Right."
07:36;07:39;"[RAPPING]"
07:47;08:00;"[RAPPING]"
08:00;08:03;"[RAPPING]"
08:03;08:14;"[RAPPING]"
08:15;08:18;"[RAPPING]"
08:18;08:38;"[RAPPING]"
08:39;08:42;"[RAPPING]"
08:42;08:49;"[RAPPING]"
09:06;09:08;"Phil and I have a tendency on this show"
09:08;09:12;"to go down Inception-type rabbit holes where--"
09:12;09:13;"That's true."
09:13;09:16;"--one conversation leads to another, leads to another."
09:16;09:19;"So we might talk about Phil Collins."
09:19;09:22;"And before we even wrap up the Phil Collins story,"
09:22;09:25;"we're talking about Fidel Castro."
09:25;09:27;"And then we've got to wrap up the Fidel Castro story."
09:27;09:29;"We've got to work our way back."
09:29;09:32;"So because we could go down such crazy rabbit holes"
09:32;09:36;"and we continue to talk about the election and its aftermath,"
09:36;09:38;"we need a safe word."
09:38;09:41;"If either one of us feels like we're getting too deep,"
09:41;09:44;"the other person has to say, it's getting too deep."
09:44;09:46;"And we're going to have a little palate cleanser."
09:46;09:48;"What's the palate cleanser going to be?"
09:48;09:49;"[MUSIC - ""IN TOO DEEP""]"
09:49;09:51;"I'm in too deep."
09:51;09:55;"You know I love you, but I just can't take this."
09:55;09:56;"That's a song by Genesis?"
09:56;09:57;"Yeah."
09:57;09:58;"What's it called?"
09:58;09:59;"It's called ""In Too Deep."""
09:59;10:00;"Oh, perfect."
10:00;10:02;"So basically, if we get in too deep"
10:02;10:05;"over the course of our little political conversation"
10:05;10:06;"and we start losing--"
10:06;10:07;"Focus."
10:07;10:10;"--start losing focus, which frankly, in this hall of mirrors--"
10:10;10:11;"Yeah."
10:11;10:13;"--crazy reality is harder than ever,"
10:13;10:15;"then we're going to say too deep and we're"
10:15;10:18;"going to listen to 15 to 20 seconds of ""In Too Deep"""
10:18;10:19;"by Genesis."
10:19;10:21;"And then we'll kind of get back on track."
10:21;10:23;"One way that we can kind of organize our thoughts"
10:23;10:27;"as we talk about this, just two average Joes,"
10:27;10:30;"not political experts, but frankly, I think"
10:30;10:35;"as we enter this hall of mirrors, crazy reality"
10:35;10:39;"of modern politics, really politics,"
10:39;10:43;"we've been let down by a lot of our pundits and our leaders."
10:43;10:45;"You and I are not leaders."
10:45;10:46;"Thank God."
10:46;10:48;"But you know, I think it's worth expecting"
10:48;10:50;"more of political leaders and pundits"
10:50;10:51;"and democratic strategists."
10:51;10:55;"So I think we should go to ask the question, who's to blame?"
10:55;10:59;"Because the past two weeks has been a big old blame game"
10:59;11:00;"tournament."
11:00;11:01;"Yep."
11:01;11:02;"And we should maybe just talk."
11:02;11:03;"We're just two guys."
11:03;11:04;"We should go through some of these reasons"
11:04;11:05;"that people are giving."
11:05;11:06;"Right."
11:06;11:08;"And look, you and I, I think, are both pretty reasonable people."
11:08;11:09;"We know there's no one reason."
11:09;11:10;"Perfect storm."
11:10;11:11;"It's a perfect storm."
11:11;11:15;"But it's amazing how many people you see on social media,"
11:15;11:18;"in the news, everybody thinks they know the one reason."
11:18;11:19;"Right."
11:19;11:20;"Right?"
11:20;11:23;"And I'm looking for people to trust moving forward."
11:23;11:26;"Anybody who tells me they know the one reason,"
11:26;11:27;"you lost my trust."
11:27;11:28;"Absolutely."
11:28;11:29;"My friend."
11:29;11:31;"But so let's break down some of these reasons."
11:31;11:33;"Let's talk about which are the most compelling."
11:33;11:34;"OK."
11:34;11:35;"And let's try not to get in too deep."
11:35;11:36;"[MUSIC - THE KING, ""LISTEN TO ME""]"
11:36;11:41;"You know I want to, but I'm in too deep."
11:41;11:46;"So listen, listen to me."
11:46;11:50;"Oh, you must believe me."
11:50;11:53;"OK, so this is a classic answer to who's"
11:53;11:55;"to blame for Hillary's loss."
11:55;11:59;"Obviously, on the macro level, Hillary lost because Trump won."
11:59;12:00;"Duh."
12:00;12:01;"Trump won because Hillary lost."
12:01;12:02;"You can look at it that way."
12:02;12:04;"But we're going to get into some of the other reasons."
12:04;12:09;"So a lot of people are very mad, as always, at the third parties."
12:09;12:10;"Are the third parties to blame?"
12:10;12:13;"Are the libertarians and the Green Party to blame?"
12:13;12:19;"Because Jake, I remember you and I are both real lefty sympathizers."
12:19;12:22;"We don't hate the Green Party like some jerks."
12:22;12:25;"But you felt very strongly that it was time for everybody"
12:25;12:27;"to grow up and not even talk about the Green Party"
12:27;12:29;"once we got to the general election."
12:29;12:31;"So do you, Jake, do you blame the third parties?"
12:31;12:32;"In part, yeah."
12:32;12:35;"I mean, I'm sure there are people in Wisconsin and Michigan"
12:35;12:37;"that voted for Jill Stein."
12:37;12:38;"Yeah, there were."
12:38;12:40;"And Hillary lost by, what, 12,000?"
12:40;12:42;"And I don't know what the margins were."
12:42;12:46;"But yeah, a couple thousand votes went to Jill Stein here and there."
12:46;12:47;"That adds up."
12:47;12:50;"Okay, counterpoint, if I may."
12:50;12:51;"Yeah."
12:51;12:53;"I've been thinking a lot, as I'm sure a lot of people have"
12:53;12:56;"over the past two weeks, about there's our personal feelings,"
12:56;13:01;"and then there's also our feelings about did the Democratic establishment fail us?"
13:01;13:05;"I'm not in the room with John Podesta and Robbie Mook."
13:05;13:06;"Did those guys fail us?"
13:06;13:09;"Because those guys had a lot more power than you and me."
13:09;13:13;"So one thing I've been thinking about, if I was a Democratic strategist,"
13:13;13:20;"rather than think of the Green Party voters as, say, naughty Democrats"
13:20;13:24;"who are acting out, maybe the Democrats would start to think of Green Party voters"
13:24;13:28;"as non-Democrats who don't vote Democrat."
13:28;13:33;"Since 1996, when the Green Party started running presidential candidates,"
13:33;13:39;"generally between roughly 0.5% and 2% of the population voted Green."
13:39;13:41;"This is not new."
13:41;13:46;"In our lifetimes, we saw a Democrat lose, and the Green Party got blamed."
13:46;13:49;"We've seen Democrats win the popular vote and lose the electoral college."
13:49;13:52;"This is not some nightmare scenario that got unleashed anywhere."
13:52;13:55;"This literally happened 16 years ago in our lifetime."
13:55;13:59;"So I'm just saying it's one thing for you or me to say to Cousin Gary,"
13:59;14:04;"""Bro, you live in Michigan. It's not as blue as New York or California."
14:04;14:08;"Bro, don't vote for Jill Stein. Vote for Hillary, man."""
14:08;14:11;"It's one thing for you and me to talk to our Cousin Gary that way,"
14:11;14:17;"but for big Democratic strategists, they should look at it numerically."
14:17;14:23;"When we run moderate candidates, there's going to be 0.5% to 2% of the population"
14:23;14:28;"who's going to not vote for somebody who, say, voted for the Iraq War out of principle."
14:28;14:33;"And rather than shaming those people and thinking of those as votes that we could have had,"
14:33;14:40;"either bring those people in by, say, running a candidate who either didn't vote for the Iraq War"
14:40;14:45;"or who's been extraordinarily apologetic about it, either of which was Hillary,"
14:45;14:47;"or consider them lost votes."
14:47;14:52;"There might be that 1% or 2% of the population that would never vote Democrat"
14:52;14:55;"and will pride themselves on always being left of the Democrats."
14:55;14:58;"So even if Bernie Sanders had won the nomination and was running,"
14:58;15:03;"he still might get 0.5% or 1% of people voting for Jill Stein."
15:03;15:05;"And these are decisions that we make."
15:05;15:06;"I understand what you're saying."
15:06;15:08;"We run imperfect candidates. I get it. It's politics, but don't be shocked."
15:08;15:14;"But I also just think people need to be pragmatic and put their precious sense of entitlement"
15:14;15:17;"and their conscience aside."
15:17;15:24;"Dude, I'm with you. I voted for Hillary even in the bluest, most indigo, salvaged denim state of New York."
15:24;15:28;"I voted for her because I wanted to--I voted against certain principles I had,"
15:28;15:32;"but I wanted to contribute to her popular vote total because I wanted to repudiate Donald Trump."
15:32;15:34;"I voted for her."
15:34;15:38;"But that said, just like we want our buddies and our friends to be pragmatic,"
15:38;15:40;"I also want the Democratic strategists to be pragmatic."
15:40;15:43;"It's not pragmatic to assume that those votes are yours."
15:43;15:45;"You know what I'm saying? From a strategic point of view."
15:45;15:47;"Maybe they didn't. I don't know. They probably didn't."
15:47;15:50;"It's kind of like if you put Garth Brooks on a bag of Fritos--"
15:50;15:51;"I like where you're going."
15:51;15:53;"You're going to win over a lot of people."
15:53;15:54;"The cells are going to go through the roof."
15:54;15:55;"A lot of people."
15:55;15:59;"A lot of people love Garth Brooks, but there's going to be that 1% to 2% of people"
15:59;16:01;"who have always hated Garth Brooks for whatever reason."
16:01;16:04;"So I'm the Green Party of Frito-Lay?"
16:04;16:06;"These are the trade-offs that we make in life, you know?"
16:06;16:09;"You make a decision. You run Hillary Clinton, you're going to lose a few people."
16:09;16:12;"It happens. You're going to put Garth Brooks on the bag of Fritos."
16:12;16:16;"Look at us trivializing this election."
16:16;16:17;"We're not trivializing it."
16:17;16:20;"This is--sounds like we're getting in too deep."
16:35;16:39;"So we're talking about who's to blame for the loss."
16:39;16:42;"We're talking about the reasons that people are throwing out there."
16:42;16:45;"Everybody knows the one reason, those disgusting Stein voters."
16:45;16:46;"It was them."
16:46;16:48;"Okay, moving on."
16:48;16:50;"Moving on from third party, we went too deep."
16:50;16:52;"Voter suppression."
16:52;16:54;"Okay, this is something I've been wondering."
16:54;17:02;"If you're a Republican and you're like, ""My party is passing this soulless legislation"
17:02;17:07;"with the intention of suppressing votes, lowering the amount of people that vote,"
17:07;17:09;"so we can win,"" how do you sleep at night?"
17:09;17:10;"Yeah, it's unforgivable."
17:10;17:15;"So in this election, there were 800-something fewer polling places in the U.S."
17:15;17:16;"than there were in 2012."
17:16;17:18;"And it absolutely had an effect."
17:18;17:20;"In North Carolina, absolutely."
17:20;17:21;"Wisconsin, too."
17:21;17:23;"To me, that's like, ""Okay, you know what, dude?"
17:23;17:26;"Okay, North Carolina, we're looking forward to 2016."
17:26;17:28;"It's going to be razor tight over there."
17:28;17:35;"What if we pass a law that makes it harder for old black people to show up"
17:35;17:38;"because there's fewer polls and they have to wait in long line and take a bus"
17:38;17:40;"and they forgot their ID, whatever it is?"""
17:40;17:41;"Yeah, it's disgusting."
17:41;17:43;"""What if we do that so then we can win?"""
17:43;17:47;"And then someone's like, ""Oh, I guess you're right."
17:47;17:49;"We'd win, but at what cost?"""
17:49;17:52;"Because they dress it up as fighting voter fraud."
17:52;17:56;"It's like for every disgusting thing that people do, there's this fake real reason."
17:56;17:59;"And the fake real reason in this is that we're fighting voter fraud."
17:59;18:02;"We can't have people showing up and voting two, three times."
18:02;18:04;"I'm with you. It's disgusting."
18:04;18:05;"There's no evidence for that."
18:05;18:09;"Plus, can you imagine the conspiracy that you'd have--"
18:09;18:16;"you would have to organize tens of thousands of people to show up secretly and vote twice."
18:16;18:19;"I know. Voting should be mandatory."
18:19;18:20;"Primaries should be open."
18:20;18:21;"We even saw it in the primaries."
18:21;18:24;"There are times that make it difficult for people to register to vote."
18:24;18:26;"People got purged from the rolls."
18:26;18:29;"Voter suppression should be a bipartisan thing."
18:29;18:33;"It doesn't matter if you like Bernie, Hillary, Jeb Bush, or Trump."
18:33;18:34;"It's crazy."
18:34;18:35;"Good Lord."
18:35;18:36;"It's crazy."
18:36;18:37;"That's brutal."
18:37;18:39;"I'm going to leave that question behind because did that affect the election 100%?"
18:39;18:40;"Absolutely."
18:40;18:43;"And is that the only reason why? No."
18:43;18:44;"But I also have a question."
18:44;18:48;"Again, you and I are just two regular Apple employees."
18:48;18:49;"Freelance."
18:49;18:51;"Freelance Apple employees."
18:51;18:56;"I just want to believe that the Democrats--"
18:56;19:00;"was there nothing that our Democratic leadership could do about that?"
19:00;19:03;"Everybody was talking about it leading up to the election."
19:03;19:05;"You couldn't get like 50 lawyers on the ground."
19:05;19:07;"I mean there must have been organizations who were dedicated to voting."
19:07;19:11;"I mean North Carolina is super Republican."
19:11;19:13;"Obama won it once."
19:13;19:15;"They have a Republican legislature."
19:15;19:18;"I think we're getting a little bit too deep on voter suppression now."
19:18;19:20;"You know I want you but I'm not too deep."
19:20;19:24;"Isra Koenig's Time Crisis."
19:33;19:36;"We don't believe you because we the people."
19:36;19:38;"A silly in the rear, yo, we don't need you."
19:38;19:41;"You ain't a killer, no, good young mood."
19:41;19:45;"When we get hungry, we eat the same food, the ramen noodle."
19:45;19:49;"You're simple voodoo, so maniacal, reliable, but pull a choo-choo."
19:49;19:54;"The irony is that this bad in my lap, she don't love me, she make money, she don't study that."
19:54;19:56;"She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me nothing back."
19:56;19:59;"She gon' take the brain away, the place you sit on at."
19:59;20:01;"With doors and signs with, don't try to rhyme with."
20:01;20:04;"VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with."
20:04;20:07;"Guilty pleasure take the edge off reality and more salary."
20:07;20:09;"I probably do that sporadically."
20:09;20:11;"The OG Gucci boots are smitten with the corners."
20:11;20:14;"The IRS piranhas see it, forget your comments."
20:14;20:16;"In the hood living in a fishbowl."
20:16;20:19;"Gentrify here now, it's not a shoddy hole."
20:19;20:22;"Trend set up, I know, but you're broke."
20:22;20:24;"And set a little because I ain't so broke."
20:24;20:30;"All your black folks, you must go."
20:30;20:35;"All your Mexican, you must know."
20:35;20:40;"And all your poor folks, you must go."
20:40;20:42;"Booze, hugs, and gays."
20:42;20:45;"Boy, we hate your ways."
20:45;20:50;"All your bad folks, you must go."
20:50;20:53;"The fog and the smog of the media that logs."
20:53;20:56;"False narratives of guys that came up against the odds."
20:56;20:59;"We not just rappers with the bars."
20:59;21:01;"It's kids with that big cosmic with the stars."
21:01;21:03;"You passers-over looking street art."
21:03;21:04;"Better yet, street smart."
21:04;21:06;"But you keep us on the charge."
21:06;21:09;"So make your numbers and your status low."
21:09;21:11;"What y'all know about you, y'all be wrong."
21:11;21:14;"It's like the A-M picture on there talking about a hit."
21:14;21:16;"The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spitting."
21:16;21:19;"We got your missus smitten rubbing on her little kitten."
21:19;21:22;"Women of the world is equal for women with no division."
21:22;21:24;"Boy, I tell you that's digi."
21:24;21:27;"Like Tony Romo when he hit everything."
21:27;21:29;"The tribe be the best in their division."
21:29;21:30;"I'm in the shot."
21:30;21:32;"Muhammad Khadi with the precision."
21:32;21:35;"Who can come back years later still hit the shot."
21:35;21:37;"And still I'm trying to move beyond the block."
21:37;21:39;"Babylon blood clot."
21:39;21:40;"And we're back."
21:40;21:41;"We just cleansed our palate."
21:41;21:45;"We're going through the reasons that people are throwing out for why Hillary lost."
21:45;21:48;"So far we've covered third parties, voter suppression."
21:48;21:51;"How about the electoral college, man?"
21:51;21:53;"I mean, where to begin?"
21:53;21:56;"That one is not too compelling to me just because--"
21:56;21:57;"Those are the rules of the game?"
21:57;21:59;"Those are the rules of the game."
21:59;22:00;"We knew it."
22:00;22:04;"Even creepy Donald Trump is getting up there being like,"
22:04;22:06;"""You used to say the electoral college was bad."
22:06;22:07;"Now you think it's good?"""
22:07;22:09;"And he said, ""No, look."
22:09;22:10;"I'm not going to change my mind."
22:10;22:12;"I still think it's bad, but, you know, we got to accept the results."
22:12;22:13;"I won."""
22:13;22:14;"Yeah."
22:14;22:15;"No, Hillary blew it."
22:15;22:17;"She didn't go to Wisconsin."
22:17;22:18;"I mean, straight up."
22:18;22:20;"They should have known there was trouble in Michigan and Wisconsin."
22:20;22:22;"And, you know, I've seen some people being like,"
22:22;22:25;"""What's with all the Monday morning quarterbacking?"""
22:25;22:27;"And I just want to be like, ""You know what?"
22:27;22:33;"Monday morning quarterbacking is lame after the Super Bowl or something,"
22:33;22:36;"but with an election, there actually is a lot to learn from it."
22:36;22:39;"We're not talking about this just for our health."""
22:39;22:42;"Yeah, be like salacious or something."
22:42;22:43;"We got to learn about these things."
22:43;22:46;"Even you and I as just average citizens, we got to learn about these things."
22:46;22:49;"We got to learn about are there better ways to fight voter suppression."
22:49;22:51;"We're learning the rules of the game."
22:51;22:52;"We're learning what we're up against, right?"
22:52;22:55;"So electoral college, I got to say, that's the least compelling one."
22:55;22:57;"And I've heard a few people say to me excitedly, like,"
22:57;23:00;"""You know, there's this faithless electors thing."
23:00;23:02;"Maybe we can convince some electors to not vote for Trump."""
23:02;23:05;"Look, I'll sign the petition, sure, but in my heart of hearts,"
23:05;23:10;"I kind of feel like if you want to get electoral college people"
23:10;23:15;"to vote against the will of the people, I'm not saying it's a bad idea,"
23:15;23:18;"but I hope your liberal militia has been training for the past eight years"
23:18;23:20;"because that's like--"
23:20;23:22;"Well, it'd be a terrible precedent."
23:22;23:23;"Yeah."
23:23;23:26;"I don't even want to get in too deep on the electoral college."
23:26;23:27;"Well, no, but let's--"
23:27;23:28;"Okay, not too deep yet."
23:28;23:33;"Before we close out on that, I just want to say and acknowledge"
23:33;23:37;"that Hillary won the popular vote by, like, whatever it is, 1.5 million."
23:37;23:38;"Yeah."
23:38;23:41;"And we said this before, that's the second time in 16 years"
23:41;23:44;"that a Democrat has won the popular and lost the electoral."
23:44;23:45;"So--"
23:45;23:46;"When are we going to learn?"
23:46;23:48;"So either we destroy the electoral college--"
23:48;23:49;"Right."
23:49;23:51;"I've heard people give examples about whether or not that's possible"
23:51;23:56;"and how you'd go about it, but say we fail to, move on to option B."
23:56;23:57;"That's what I'm saying."
23:57;23:58;"Yeah."
23:58;23:59;"And also, actually--"
23:59;24:01;"Win Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania."
24:01;24:02;"Yeah."
24:02;24:03;"Let's do it."
24:03;24:04;"I mean, that was the difference."
24:04;24:08;"That was the--those three, less than 100,000 votes spread out."
24:08;24:13;"One other thing that I've been thinking about is, you know, everybody--"
24:13;24:14;"and look, I spend a lot of time in L.A."
24:14;24:18;"I'm still a New York resident, but, you know, I can't try to be holier than thou,"
24:18;24:24;"but a lot of people would sometimes get called hipsters, young people."
24:24;24:26;"I'm not familiar with the term."
24:26;24:30;"It's a certain type of young, generally college-educated person,"
24:30;24:33;"got a little bit of money, they like the arts or whatever."
24:33;24:34;"Okay."
24:34;24:39;"And a lot of those people have been moving from New York to L.A."
24:39;24:45;"because New York has been hyper-gentrified, got a lot of bankers there,"
24:45;24:47;"kind of lost its artistic soul."
24:47;24:48;"Right."
24:48;24:49;"That's what some of the haters are saying."
24:49;24:51;"There's like a Chase bank on every other corner."
24:51;24:52;"Yep."
24:52;24:54;"Chase, Starbucks, Chase, Starbucks."
24:54;24:55;"Right."
24:55;24:58;"So I've heard a lot of people tell me that they moved from New York to L.A."
24:58;25:02;"because they couldn't stand how corporate New York was getting."
25:02;25:04;"Look, there's a lot of reasons to move to L.A."
25:04;25:08;"It's a beautiful place, but moving to L.A. to get away"
25:08;25:13;"from that corporate, real estate-driven gentrification stuff"
25:13;25:14;"is not a good example."
25:14;25:16;"So here's what I want to say."
25:16;25:19;"If you've got to move to L.A. because you've got friends, family here, whatever,"
25:19;25:21;"you love surfing--"
25:21;25:23;"You're in the industry."
25:23;25:25;"You've got a job in the industry, of course."
25:25;25:27;"I cannot judge anybody for moving to L.A."
25:27;25:30;"But if you want to move outside of New York"
25:30;25:35;"because you just want to rent a space to work on your paintings,"
25:35;25:40;"your noise music, whatever it is you do, for cheap--"
25:40;25:41;"Move to Philly and vote."
25:41;25:44;"Move to Philly, move to Pittsburgh, move to Detroit."
25:44;25:47;"I've got so much respect for people who actually reject--"
25:47;25:49;"because, look, I was born in Manhattan."
25:49;25:50;"That's my homeland."
25:50;25:54;"Generations of my family were born on that disgusting island."
25:54;25:56;"I kind of got to stick it out there, I think."
25:56;26:01;"But if anybody kind of gave New York or L.A. a try and they're getting burned out,"
26:01;26:04;"I guess that's a lot to ask of a person."
26:04;26:06;"Those are great cities, first of all."
26:06;26:10;"Those are great cities where there are thriving artistic communities."
26:10;26:12;"Oh, Philly, Pittsburgh, and Detroit."
26:12;26:15;"Yeah, you might not be able to get internship advice in those cities,"
26:15;26:17;"but those are great places."
26:17;26:19;"There's great artists. There's great music there."
26:19;26:22;"We're not saying, like, oh, you should go move to Siberia."
26:22;26:24;"These are great places."
26:24;26:28;"I don't know. I sound like that goofy New York Times op-ed that was like--"
26:28;26:30;"young hipster, move out."
26:30;26:33;"But whatever, I'm just saying, like, 100,000 votes, man."
26:33;26:37;"So I think maybe you and I should compile a list of the 100,000 worst people"
26:37;26:40;"that we know in New York and California"
26:40;26:45;"and then raise money to send them to Wisconsin, Michigan."
26:45;26:47;"Man, Wisconsin, don't sleep on Milwaukee."
26:47;26:49;"Great town. And Madison?"
26:49;26:50;"Never been."
26:50;26:51;"Gorgeous. Really?"
26:51;26:52;"Yeah."
26:52;26:55;"Producer Colin's telling us we're getting in a little too deep."
26:55;26:59;"You know I want you, but I'm in too deep."
26:59;27:01;"Beats one."
27:01;27:06;"So listen, listen to me"
27:06;27:09;"Oh, you must believe me"
27:09;27:10;"And we're back."
27:10;27:12;"So far we've talked about the third parties,"
27:12;27:14;"voter suppression, electoral college."
27:14;27:18;"These are all reasons that people have been blaming for Hillary's loss."
27:18;27:22;"How about good old-fashioned sexism?"
27:22;27:23;"That's a big one."
27:23;27:27;"I've seen people make the case that this all came down to sexism."
27:27;27:28;"What do you say to that?"
27:28;27:32;"Well, I mean, like we said, I don't think it all came down to sexism,"
27:32;27:34;"but I think it was a factor."
27:34;27:37;"Anybody who would deny that sexism played a role in this,"
27:37;27:40;"however much you think Hillary's whack,"
27:40;27:42;"don't be a dufflehead."
27:42;27:43;"Of course it played a role."
27:43;27:45;"This is a macho country, too."
27:45;27:50;"I mean, I know a lot of other countries have elected women as leaders,"
27:50;27:55;"although it might be easier if you were a conservative woman to get elected."
27:55;28:02;"Some of the iconic female leaders of the 20th century tended to be fairly right-wing."
28:02;28:07;"I think it's a macho country, and I had this terrible feeling"
28:07;28:12;"when I was watching the debates on an almost primal level"
28:12;28:16;"when I saw Trump kind of like amble out onto the stage"
28:16;28:19;"with his jaw jutted forward."
28:19;28:21;"He was just like projecting the--"
28:21;28:23;"I mean, to me it was cartoonish and a joke,"
28:23;28:26;"but I was like, oh, I could see that reading for people as like--"
28:26;28:27;"Horrible."
28:27;28:28;"--this is like a man."
28:28;28:34;"This is like a tall, strong man, and Hillary's like an old woman."
28:34;28:39;"And I just felt it in my gut, which is I think a lot of elections--"
28:39;28:42;"That was your internalized misogyny."
28:42;28:44;"Yeah, no, I didn't feel it, but I like--"
28:44;28:49;"No, it triggered something because you grew up in this macho, sexist country."
28:49;28:50;"You're familiar with that way of thinking."
28:50;28:53;"When they made their entrance onto the stage, was that sort of like split-second thing?"
28:53;28:56;"That sort of like Malcolm Gladwell blink thing?"
28:56;28:57;"Yeah."
28:57;29:01;"I remember the first debate, the way he came out on the stage, I was like, uh-oh."
29:01;29:06;"Now, obviously you and I, as two people who identify as male,"
29:06;29:09;"we don't have a whole lot of insight into what it's like to be a woman."
29:09;29:14;"We can only listen to the women around us and the people who identify as female."
29:14;29:16;"So I don't think there's that much for us to say about it other than,"
29:16;29:18;"of course sex hasn't played a role in this election."
29:18;29:20;"Of course it's real."
29:20;29:25;"Hard to make the case that it's the only reason because there's never only one reason."
29:25;29:28;"But here's what I've got to say because sometimes people talk about this,"
29:28;29:31;"like when you start talking about could Bernie have won?"
29:31;29:35;"Whether or not, if you want to look forward, what type of candidate could win?"
29:35;29:39;"And people say, when somebody says, well, Hillary only lost because she's a woman,"
29:39;29:43;"I don't agree that that's the only reason she lost, but I also would like to say,"
29:43;29:44;"well, what can we take away from that?"
29:44;29:49;"If Hillary really only lost because she's a woman, that gives us two choices."
29:49;29:51;"Never run female candidates again."
29:51;29:52;"Sorry, Elizabeth Warren."
29:52;29:54;"Which of course we can't do."
29:54;29:56;"I'd be happy if every candidate's female. Who cares?"
29:56;30:01;"We're not going to back down from that as people on the left, however you identify."
30:01;30:02;"Absolutely."
30:02;30:03;"So then what's left?"
30:03;30:08;"Either run female candidates who have done things slightly differently than Hillary"
30:08;30:12;"with regards to their record or whatever policies they've supported,"
30:12;30:16;"and continue to denounce sexism in the life of this country."
30:16;30:18;"That's the only option, right?"
30:18;30:23;"As much as I don't want to underplay that that's a serious problem,"
30:23;30:26;"there's also just not that much to discuss moving forward."
30:26;30:28;"There's plenty to discuss about sexism."
30:28;30:30;"There's not that much to talk about in terms of--"
30:30;30:31;"Pragmatically."
30:32;30:37;"Because anybody who says, therefore, we should not run female candidates, get out of here."
30:37;30:41;"All we can do is continue to run female candidates with the best records possible"
30:41;30:44;"and support the things we believe in and fight sexism."
30:44;30:48;"It's amazing. All these people out there protesting Donald Trump,"
30:48;30:52;"women, sexual assault survivors. That's amazing. That needs to keep happening."
30:52;30:55;"So I think we've gotten about as deep as we're going to get on that one."
34:01;34:05;"Even in like 8th grade, you study the World War II and the Holocaust, right?"
34:05;34:08;"They teach you the word ""scapegoat."" You know, they say,"
34:08;34:11;"""The German people really did suffer."
34:11;34:16;"They had crazy inflation. Between World War I and World War II, things got really bad."
34:16;34:20;"People were starving. When this guy Hitler came along and inflamed, you know,"
34:20;34:22;"took anti-Semitism and got it bigger and bigger."""
34:22;34:25;"We're not trying to say that anti-Semitism didn't exist,"
34:25;34:29;"but racism and economic anxiety, a demagogue,"
34:29;34:32;"it can put those things together to amazing effect."
34:32;34:34;"And you don't have to choose which is which."
34:34;34:37;"Of course, Trump is racist. He's surrounding himself with racists."
34:37;34:40;"Anybody who voted for him--"
34:40;34:41;"--is tolerant."
34:41;34:43;"--is tolerant of racism, which means they're racist."
34:43;34:46;"We can get into the spectrum of what it means."
34:46;34:50;"But yeah, anybody who voted for him has condoned racism, and that means you're racist."
34:50;34:55;"The question is, are we going to learn from this"
34:55;34:59;"that the Democrats should not care about poor people?"
34:59;35:01;"And that's what's so weird to me."
35:01;35:05;"It's like people seem to be making the case that because Trump voters are racist,"
35:05;35:09;"the Democrats don't have to change a thing because racism--"
35:09;35:12;"Wait. Okay. I'm a little confused."
35:12;35:14;"Say you're somebody who says--"
35:14;35:17;"Sometimes you might see, like, a socialist making the argument."
35:17;35:20;"A lot of the people in these Rust Belt states--"
35:20;35:21;"Yeah."
35:21;35:24;"--have been hurting, and they continue to hurt under Obama,"
35:24;35:26;"and they voted for Trump."
35:26;35:29;"Somebody else could say, yeah, well, because they're racist,"
35:29;35:33;"versus saying they tolerated racism and they gave in to racism"
35:33;35:35;"because of their economic anxiety."
35:35;35:39;"All I'm saying is clearly the Democrats have to run candidates"
35:39;35:43;"with credibility for helping poor people across the board."
35:43;35:44;"Yeah. Absolutely."
35:44;35:46;"And that's the good news. You don't have to choose one or the other."
35:46;35:50;"Because some people say, oh, what, we should pander to working-class white racists?"
35:50;35:51;"Of course not."
35:51;35:55;"The weird part is that Obama won a lot of those counties prior."
35:55;36:01;"Right. So then the question is, did Obama win those counties by pandering to racists?"
36:01;36:03;"I don't see any evidence for that."
36:03;36:04;"No."
36:04;36:09;"What I've heard people talking about is that when it was Obama versus Romney,"
36:09;36:14;"it was essentially a pretty race-neutral campaign,"
36:14;36:17;"and that Obama was not out there being like, I'm a black dude,"
36:17;36:19;"I represent all black people."
36:19;36:25;"It was like Romney represented Capitol and Obama represented the workers."
36:25;36:26;"Right."
36:26;36:32;"Since then, because Hillary can't implicitly represent minorities"
36:32;36:36;"because she's a white woman, the Democratic Party has kind of taken on like"
36:36;36:42;"gay rights, immigrant rights, and then this election became about"
36:42;36:46;"old white people being like, mm-mm, I don't like the way this is going."
36:46;36:50;"I don't like looking at it that way because the Democrats should take those issues on their back."
36:50;36:51;"Absolutely."
36:51;36:52;"Because it's right."
36:52;36:55;"We're back at the looking glass because Trump was the one that was able to take"
36:55;37:00;"the economic populist message that was traditionally from the left"
37:00;37:03;"and just take that and run with it."
37:03;37:05;"He was like, I care about working people."
37:05;37:06;"NAFTA was a terrible deal."
37:06;37:08;"That's why I wish, I think in the future--"
37:08;37:12;"I'm going to bring jobs back to middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania,"
37:12;37:14;"which he has no prayer of doing."
37:14;37:18;"All we can hope is that as he fails to do that,"
37:18;37:22;"and there's a lot of indication to see he wasn't serious about that,"
37:22;37:24;"that we can put up candidates who have credibility"
37:24;37:26;"when it comes to fighting for working people."
37:26;37:27;"I don't know where we're at right now."
37:27;37:28;"It sounds like we're in too deep."
37:28;37:30;"You know I watch you, baby"
37:30;37:35;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
37:42;37:59;"Can I kick it? Yes, you can."
37:59;38:02;"Well, I'm gone."
38:02;38:05;"Can I kick it to all the people who can quest like a tribe does?"
38:05;38:08;"Before this, did you really know what love was?"
38:08;38:10;"Comprehend to the track force why 'cause"
38:10;38:13;"Getting inches on the tip of the vibe buzz"
38:13;38:15;"Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz"
38:15;38:18;"Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug"
38:18;38:20;"If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug"
38:20;38:23;"Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug"
38:23;38:25;"Afrocentric living is a big shrug"
38:25;38:28;"A life filled with, that's what I love"
38:28;38:30;"A lower plateau is what we're above"
38:30;38:33;"If you diss us, we won't even think of"
38:33;38:35;"We'll nip up the dog and give a big shove"
38:35;38:38;"This rhythm really fits like a snug glove"
38:38;38:40;"Like a box of positives, it's a plus love"
38:40;38:43;"As the trial flies high like a dove"
38:45;38:47;"So let's bring it to one last thing"
38:47;38:48;"that people have been blaming for the loss."
38:48;38:50;"- Okay."
38:50;38:53;"- It's a guy and his name is Bernie Sanders."
38:53;38:54;"- Blaming Bernie?"
38:54;38:57;"- Oh people have been blaming Bernie."
38:57;38:58;"Blaming Bernie."
38:58;38:59;"- That's crazy."
38:59;39:02;"- Some people said that he went in way too hard on Hillary"
39:02;39:04;"and that he was such a jerk,"
39:04;39:07;"staying in the primary even when he knew"
39:07;39:08;"that he was probably gonna lose."
39:08;39:10;"What do you say to that?"
39:10;39:11;"(laughs)"
39:11;39:14;"They said he hurt her, he damaged her."
39:14;39:16;"- That's BS."
39:16;39:18;"- The most brutal part is one of the main reasons"
39:18;39:20;"he stayed in the primary,"
39:20;39:22;"and this has been made clear,"
39:22;39:23;"is that he wanted leverage"
39:23;39:26;"to make the Democratic platform better."
39:26;39:28;"And one of the things that he really felt passionately about"
39:28;39:30;"was called the fight for 15."
39:30;39:32;"He and a lot of people believed"
39:32;39:35;"that the minimum wage should go from $12 to $15."
39:35;39:37;"Can you believe that there are people"
39:37;39:40;"in the Democratic Party who fought hard against that?"
39:40;39:43;"Even Hillary was not down with it at first."
39:43;39:46;"People will bring out any reason possible"
39:46;39:47;"to explain why,"
39:47;39:49;"well actually if you bring up the minimum wage,"
39:49;39:51;"then employers might start,"
39:51;39:52;"that's Republican talk."
39:52;39:54;"This is the party that takes care of people."
39:54;39:56;"$3 an hour."
39:56;39:58;"Rich people saying that you should not"
39:58;39:59;"bring up the minimum wage."
39:59;40:02;"I don't know, you can go pull out any economic reason"
40:02;40:04;"you want why that's a bad idea."
40:04;40:05;"I don't buy it."
40:05;40:07;"That's a really weak argument."
40:07;40:10;"It's crazy to me that people would be blaming Bernie"
40:10;40:14;"because yeah, he pulled the party left."
40:14;40:17;"He energized people in the party."
40:17;40:19;"He got people pumped up."
40:19;40:21;"And the problem with Hillary,"
40:21;40:22;"and one of the reasons that she lost,"
40:22;40:24;"was there was terrible turnout."
40:24;40:25;"Yeah."
40:25;40:28;"Because the base wasn't fired up."
40:28;40:30;"Millions of people just didn't turn up."
40:30;40:33;"Oh yeah, millennials did not turn up."
40:33;40:34;"Brutal, I thought millennials liked to turn up."
40:34;40:38;"If you're a Time Crisis listener in Wisconsin or Michigan,"
40:38;40:41;"and you're a millennial and you stayed home, you blew it."
40:41;40:42;"Damn Jake."
40:42;40:44;"Well, real talk."
40:44;40:48;"I mean yeah, it's indefensible."
40:48;40:49;"Yeah."
40:49;40:52;"I really thought that millennials liked to turn up."
40:52;40:54;"(hip hop music)"
41:26;41:52;"- You're listening to Time Crisis."
41:52;41:53;"- Time Crisis."
41:53;41:55;"- On beats."
41:55;41:56;"- That was our election talk."
41:56;41:57;"Just two guys hashing it out."
41:57;41:59;"Of course, look, one lesson we learned"
41:59;42:01;"is that politics never goes away."
42:01;42:02;"We gotta keep our ears to the ground."
42:02;42:04;"We gotta be talking about it."
42:04;42:05;"We gotta have guests in the future"
42:05;42:08;"who can educate us and help us understand things."
42:08;42:09;"But the one thing I wanna say is like,"
42:09;42:11;"anybody who's listening,"
42:11;42:13;"you know, Jake and I are relatively pragmatic people."
42:13;42:16;"We're lefties, but you gotta question things."
42:16;42:17;"The one thing I'll say that I don't like"
42:17;42:20;"is you see a lot of people on Twitter, whatever,"
42:20;42:21;"people are arguing politics."
42:21;42:22;"And occasionally you'll see people saying,"
42:22;42:25;"look, we're all upset with what happened."
42:25;42:26;"We don't have to infight."
42:26;42:30;"As I've said before, democracy is fundamentally unpleasant."
42:30;42:32;"Democracy means arguing with people."
42:32;42:35;"So all I'll say is protect yourself and your sanity."
42:35;42:38;"If your friends are talking politics, your family,"
42:38;42:39;"and you're getting into disagreement,"
42:39;42:40;"there's nothing wrong with saying,"
42:40;42:42;"hey guys, I'm gonna go play Splashy Fish"
42:42;42:45;"in the bathroom for 10 to 15 minutes."
42:45;42:46;"You don't have to talk about politics,"
42:46;42:49;"but you gotta let people argue."
42:49;42:50;"Everybody should be nice to each other,"
42:50;42:53;"but let's not pretend that we, you know,"
42:53;42:55;"arguing is part of how we move forward,"
42:55;42:57;"arguing about who should be the DNC chair."
42:57;43:00;"You know that I think it should be Keith Ellison."
43:00;43:02;"We gotta argue about these things."
43:02;43:03;"So just try to be nice to each other."

45:10;45:13;"- When I came into the studio today,"
45:13;45:19;"our producer had two bags of Lay's potato chips"
45:19;45:21;"with very unusual flavors."
45:21;45:26;"'Cause I guess to soothe the soul of a divided nation,"
45:26;45:29;"Lay's decided that they were gonna bring back"
45:29;45:33;"some of the winners from their Lay's fan contest."
45:33;45:36;"'Cause they do these contests where people pitch ideas"
45:36;45:38;"for what could be Lay's, you know?"
45:38;45:39;"- Really?"
45:39;45:40;"- You're not familiar with this?"
45:40;45:41;"- No."
45:41;45:42;"- I thought you, okay, well,"
45:42;45:44;"you clearly don't follow politics close enough."
45:44;45:47;"It's essentially an election that Lay's has every year"
45:47;45:49;"where people throw out ideas."
45:49;45:50;"Like somebody could be like,"
45:50;45:55;"I think it'd be a good idea to do a sweet potato Lay's."
45:55;45:57;"You know, and then people vote and somebody wins"
45:57;45:59;"and they win a cash prize or something."
45:59;46:01;"So on the plate in front of you,"
46:01;46:03;"we have two different types of Lay's."
46:03;46:07;"A very optimistic brand, as Jennifer Sines told us."
46:07;46:09;"I'm just curious."
46:09;46:11;"And again, I just also want everybody to know,"
46:11;46:15;"we've never taken a dime from Lay's or anything."
46:15;46:16;"- We would."
46:16;46:18;"- Well, speak for yourself, man."
46:18;46:19;"- I was."
46:19;46:20;"- But you said we."
46:20;46:20;"Okay, gotcha."
46:20;46:21;"- Wait, what?"
46:21;46:22;"- Gotcha."
46:22;46:26;"So anyway, I'm curious about if you can tell"
46:26;46:27;"what these are supposed to be."
46:27;46:29;"So take a bite of one."
46:29;46:31;"And remember, these are the kind of unusual flavors."
46:31;46:33;"And I want you to guess what it might be."
46:33;46:41;"- Pretty understated."
46:41;46:41;"- Okay."
46:41;46:42;"- Pretty subtle."
46:42;46:44;"Like an onion?"
46:44;46:45;"- An onion?"
46:45;46:47;"Well, you know it's not just gonna be onion."
46:47;46:49;"- Like onion cheddar jalapeno?"
46:49;46:51;"(laughing)"
46:51;46:54;"- Is that your final guess?"
46:54;46:55;"Onion cheddar jalapeno?"
46:55;46:56;"- Yeah."
46:56;46:57;"- It was garlic cheese bread."
46:58;47:00;"(dramatic music)"
47:00;47:02;"- Wow."
47:02;47:03;"- How does that make you feel?"
47:03;47:04;"- That's a thing?"
47:04;47:05;"- Yeah, man."
47:05;47:06;"- You know what's funny?"
47:06;47:09;"If this was just in a bowl at a party and I ate them,"
47:09;47:10;"I don't think I'd even notice."
47:10;47:12;"- You wouldn't even think twice."
47:12;47:14;"- I think I'm just like, oh, it's potato chips."
47:14;47:16;"- Just pounding a brew,"
47:16;47:18;"talking about the Eagles with somebody at a party,"
47:18;47:20;"just dipping in."
47:20;47:22;"- Pretty good."
47:22;47:23;"- Pretty good."
47:23;47:25;"Okay, so you did not correctly identify"
47:25;47:26;"cheesy garlic bread."
47:26;47:27;"- All right, let me do the other one."
47:30;47:30;"- Oh."
47:30;47:33;"(laughing)"
47:33;47:36;"- You like it?"
47:36;47:37;"You love it?"
47:37;47:39;"What do you think of that one?"
47:39;47:40;"- Like a chive or something?"
47:40;47:41;"Like a..."
47:41;47:43;"- Chive."
47:43;47:45;"If you had to guess which part of America,"
47:45;47:49;"geographically, that potato chip is associated with,"
47:49;47:50;"what would you guess?"
47:50;47:53;"New England, Midwest?"
47:53;47:56;"- There's an interesting sort of aftertaste on it."
47:56;47:59;"- Yeah, okay, but does it take you to a place?"
47:59;48:00;"- Hold on, hold on, hold on."
48:00;48:03;"(laughing)"
48:03;48:05;"- Jake's really taking this seriously."
48:05;48:06;"I love this."
48:06;48:08;"- So it's regional is what you're saying."
48:08;48:10;"- It's associated with a region of the United States."
48:10;48:12;"- Of all the regions in the US"
48:12;48:14;"that have flavors associated with them."
48:14;48:15;"- Okay."
48:15;48:16;"- Southwest is the most classic."
48:16;48:19;"- The most classic?"
48:19;48:20;"- Yeah."
48:20;48:22;"- You think Southwest is the most classic?"
48:22;48:24;"- Yeah, like Southwest."
48:24;48:25;"- Chipotle mayo."
48:25;48:26;"- Yeah, whatever."
48:26;48:29;"- Okay, well, does that taste like the Southwest to you?"
48:29;48:32;"Are you getting an Albuquerque, New Mexico vibe?"
48:32;48:33;"- Oh, like a green chili?"
48:33;48:35;"- Did it make you think of John McCain,"
48:35;48:37;"Senator from Arizona?"
48:37;48:38;"- No."
48:38;48:40;"- Okay, so it's not Southwest, man."
48:40;48:42;"Think of another region that's associated with food."
48:42;48:45;"- New Orleans?"
48:45;48:46;"- Warmer."
48:46;48:47;"- Texas."
48:47;48:49;"- All right, all right, whatever."
48:49;48:51;"- Florida panhandle."
48:51;48:52;"- Read it, read to me what it is."
48:52;48:54;"- Oh my God, it's disgusting, I wanna throw up."
48:54;48:55;"- It's Southern biscuits and gravy."
48:55;48:57;"(groaning)"
48:57;48:59;"- Southern biscuits and gravy."
48:59;49:01;"- Southern biscuits and gravy, dog."
49:01;49:04;"Didn't like it, huh?"
49:04;49:06;"- That's disgusting."
49:06;49:07;"- Okay."
49:07;49:08;"- That is such a bummer."
49:08;49:09;"(laughing)"
49:09;49:10;"- What's a bummer about it?"
49:10;49:12;"- Okay, third ingredient on here,"
49:12;49:14;"after potatoes and vegetable oil."
49:14;49:15;"- Probably biscuits."
49:15;49:17;"- Southern biscuits and gravy seasoning."
49:17;49:19;"(laughing)"
49:19;49:20;"- And then do they have to break down?"
49:20;49:22;"- That tells you a lot, no."
49:22;49:25;"- It just says, malto dextrin made from corn."
49:25;49:27;"- Just like mama used to make."
49:27;49:29;"- I like this, on the potato chip bag it says,"
49:29;49:32;"contains milk ingredients."
49:32;49:34;"- Yeah man, in case you're vegan."
49:34;49:37;"- You can't have that biscuits and gravy."
49:37;49:38;"- That was the hardest part."
49:38;49:39;"- That's a messed up choice, dude."
49:39;49:41;"- My cousin who went vegan, that was the hardest part,"
49:41;49:44;"was giving up the Southern biscuits and gravy"
49:44;49:46;"Lay's potato chips."
49:46;49:47;"- Can you imagine just a dude"
49:47;49:48;"like crushing a whole bag of those?"
49:48;49:49;"(laughing)"
49:49;49:51;"- I can imagine it very well, I know that guy."
49:51;49:54;"- Some guy on election night, just like pounding brews,"
49:54;49:56;"voted for Trump in Wisconsin."
49:56;49:57;"- A very optimistic fellow."
49:57;50:01;"- Just crushing these biscuits and gravy."
50:01;50:03;"- We're trying to lighten things up for a second."
50:03;50:05;"I'm just trying to enjoy Lay's biscuits"
50:05;50:06;"and Southern biscuits and gravy,"
50:06;50:09;"now you're making me think of election night, brutal."
50:09;50:13;"♪ I've been laying with you night after night ♪"
50:13;50:17;"♪ You leave before I see the morning light ♪"

51:15;51:18;"of those Southern biscuits and gravy Lay's in your mouth?"
51:18;51:20;"- No, wash it down with Modelo."
51:20;51:22;"- Everybody's got their brands."
51:22;51:24;"You're not a Lay's guy, you're a Modelo man."
51:24;51:26;"- Absolutely."
51:26;51:27;"- Good for you."
51:27;51:30;"Well, as promised, we are gonna talk about Leonard Cohen,"
51:30;51:35;"the recently deceased poet, novelist, singer, songwriter."
51:35;51:37;"Died at 82 years old."
51:37;51:38;"- Good run."
51:38;51:39;"- You a fan, Jake?"
51:39;51:40;"- Not really."
51:40;51:43;"Mad respect, but never connected,"
51:43;51:45;"a little too morose for me."
51:45;51:46;"- Okay."
51:47;51:48;"- I'm a big fan."
51:48;51:51;"My parents didn't have his records, which is interesting."
51:51;51:54;"Kind of seemed like they would, but remember, yeah,"
51:54;51:57;"when I was like maybe 17, 18, I found at a yard sale,"
51:57;52:00;"his first album, got into that."
52:00;52:02;"And I've just always admired him as a songwriter,"
52:02;52:04;"a lyricist, a dude."
52:04;52:06;"And also one thing I love about him"
52:06;52:08;"is that he got started late in life."
52:08;52:10;"First album, age 33."
52:10;52:11;"- Wow."
52:11;52:12;"- Already kind of had a career as like a poet,"
52:12;52:14;"you know, a starving artist."
52:14;52:16;"Drops his first album at 33."
52:16;52:20;"And then, you know, has like a lot of commercial ups"
52:20;52:22;"and downs, like a really passionate cult following."
52:22;52:25;"Things got a little dicey, late 70s, early 80s."
52:25;52:27;"1984, he drops the album ""Various Positions,"""
52:27;52:29;"which contained a song called ""Hallelujah."""
52:29;52:31;"- What year was the first record?"
52:31;52:32;"Like late 60s?"
52:32;52:33;"- I think '67 or '68."
52:33;52:38;"So he drops this album in 1984 called ""Various Positions."""
52:38;52:40;"Tanked, nobody bought it."
52:40;52:41;"- Yeah."
52:41;52:42;"- Flop."
52:42;52:43;"- Huh."
52:43;52:44;"- Pathetic showing."
52:44;52:47;"And yet that album contained a song called ""Hallelujah."""
52:47;52:49;"I think it vaguely charted in a few countries,"
52:49;52:52;"but in the Anglo-sphere, tanked,"
52:52;52:53;"little did he know that this song would go on"
52:53;52:55;"to become this iconic song."
52:55;52:56;"So this is a guy, he's already, you know,"
52:56;52:57;"imagine being like 50,"
52:57;53:03;"and you drop an album, you know,"
53:03;53:04;"and it tanks."
53:04;53:05;"And you think maybe you wrote the best song"
53:05;53:07;"you'll ever write on it."
53:07;53:07;"That's gotta hurt."
53:07;53:08;"- Yeah."
53:08;53:10;"- But life's funny like that, you know?"
53:10;53:10;"It came around."
53:11;53:13;"- I wanna play some of his music and talk about him"
53:13;53:15;"and, you know, celebrate."
53:15;53:16;"- Let's do it."
53:16;53:16;"- The man."
53:16;53:19;"But I thought we'd start by talking about ""Hallelujah,"""
53:19;53:21;"because that is his most famous song."
53:21;53:23;"- Covered by Jeff Buckley."
53:23;53:26;"- Covered by Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright."
53:26;53:28;"People always sing it on like singing shows now."
53:28;53:29;"- Yeah."
53:29;53:30;"- And actually before he died,"
53:30;53:32;"it made it back into the charts"
53:32;53:36;"on a Christmas album by the acapella group Pentatonix."
53:36;53:38;"I've been listening to their version."
53:38;53:39;"It was interesting to me, I was thinking about this"
53:39;53:42;"when I saw their acapella version,"
53:42;53:44;"that this song has had such a wild ride,"
53:44;53:46;"like going from being on a flop album"
53:46;53:48;"to becoming a modern classic."
53:48;53:51;"And even to the point that this group Pentatonix"
53:51;53:53;"put it on a Christmas album."
53:53;53:54;"This song has such a wild journey."
53:54;53:57;"It's almost now it's like a modern Christmas classic."
53:57;54:01;"As with many great songs, some of the best songs,"
54:01;54:03;"it's hard to put your finger on exactly what it's about."
54:03;54:04;"- Yeah."
54:04;54:08;"- So I love lyrics, love discussing them."
54:08;54:12;"So I thought we should do a close reading of ""Hallelujah."""
54:12;54:13;"One of the most famous songs"
54:13;54:16;"that is kind of hard to understand."
54:16;54:19;"I'm not saying we're gonna get to the bottom of it,"
54:19;54:21;"but let's take a look at the lyrics"
54:21;54:22;"and kind of break it down."
54:22;54:25;"- Should we listen to the version from '84 or?"
54:25;54:27;"- No, I made an executive decision."
54:27;54:30;"We're gonna listen to the most recent version"
54:30;54:31;"by Pentatonix."
54:31;54:32;"- Okay."
54:32;54:33;"- I like it."
54:33;54:34;"I wonder if you like it."
54:34;54:37;"Pentatonix, by the way, is like a pop acapella group."
54:37;54:38;"Five people."
54:38;54:40;"- Pop a-"
54:40;54:41;"- They're killing it. - What does that even mean?"
54:41;54:43;"- It means that they're an acapella group,"
54:43;54:44;"but they're not like, you know,"
54:44;54:46;"playing in the basement of some dorm"
54:46;54:48;"at the University of Minnesota."
54:48;54:50;"They're out there selling out arenas."
54:50;54:53;"- But they're doing like covers of pop songs."
54:53;54:54;"- Yeah, maybe some originals."
54:54;54:55;"I don't know, man."
54:55;54:56;"They just put out a Christmas album."
54:56;54:58;"- ♪ You are beautiful ♪"
54:58;54:59;"- Maybe."
54:59;55:00;"Why not?"
55:00;55:01;"But so this is their version of ""Hallelujah,"""
55:01;55:03;"and we're gonna go verse by verse to break it down."
55:03;55:04;"- Okay."
55:04;55:05;"- So obviously the song is called ""Hallelujah."""
55:05;55:08;"First, we're gonna really go in deep on this song."
55:08;55:10;"- Please. - All right?"
55:10;55:12;"(soft music)"
55:12;55:25;"- ""Hallelujah,"" that's the name of the song."
55:25;55:26;"- Yeah."
55:26;55:27;"- What does ""Hallelujah"" mean?"
55:27;55:31;"- Like, hell yeah."
55:31;55:34;"- Okay, that's a pretty, I mean, that's how people use it."
55:34;55:38;"- It means like, thank sweet Jesus,"
55:38;55:41;"but in a secular sense, but slightly religious."
55:41;55:44;"- Well, it comes from religion, originally."
55:44;55:45;"- I've never said that word in my life."
55:45;55:47;"- Really? - Like casually."
55:47;55:49;"Like if you're watching a baseball game and like--"
55:49;55:51;"- You never got over your buddy?"
55:51;55:52;"- Late inning base hit, ties the game,"
55:52;55:54;"I'm never like, ""Hallelujah!"""
55:54;55:55;"- Never?"
55:55;55:56;"- No, I've never done that."
55:56;56:00;"- You ever like get home late at night"
56:00;56:03;"and you thought you only had one Modelo left"
56:03;56:04;"and then you see your roommates on the couch"
56:04;56:06;"drinking a Modelo and you're like,"
56:06;56:08;"""Oh my God, all I wanted was a Modelo."""
56:08;56:11;"Then you open the fridge and you see there is one left,"
56:11;56:12;"you never be like, ""Hallelujah!"""
56:12;56:13;"- Hallelujah!"
56:13;56:14;"(laughing)"
56:14;56:14;"- Hallelujah!"
56:14;56:16;"- Yes, okay, if I was gonna use it,"
56:16;56:18;"that would be the perfect context."
56:18;56:19;"- That would be the time that you would use it."
56:19;56:20;"- Yep."
56:20;56:21;"- Hallelujah."
56:21;56:23;"- I'd be like, ""Oh, thank God."""
56:23;56:28;"- Hallelujah, originally, the earliest usage of this phrase"
56:28;56:30;"was in a book called ""The Bible."""
56:30;56:31;"Maybe you heard of it?"
56:31;56:32;"- Yep."
56:32;56:36;"- It's a Hebrew word and we can break it down."
56:36;56:38;"We're breaking down the etymology of it."
56:38;56:41;"This is linguistics on time crisis."
56:41;56:45;"What are the last three letters of ""Hallelujah?"""
56:45;56:45;"- Jah."
56:45;56:46;"- Jah, J-A-H."
56:46;56:48;"- Jah live."
56:48;56:51;"- Now, all of us fans of reggae"
56:51;56:56;"know that Rastafarians call the God figure Jah."
56:56;56:57;"- Yeah."
56:57;56:59;"- What do the Hebrews call God?"
56:59;57:00;"- I don't know."
57:00;57:03;"- Fair enough, I know more about the Hebrews."
57:03;57:06;"We call the most high Yah, Yahweh."
57:06;57:10;"So Jah and Yah and Yahweh, it's all the same thing,"
57:10;57:11;"it's God."
57:11;57:12;"- Yeah."
57:12;57:16;"- So we know that Hallelujah, the word, is something God."
57:16;57:17;"Guess what it is about God?"
57:17;57:20;"- Praise to Lord."
57:20;57:21;"Hello, Lord."
57:21;57:23;"- Well, yeah, it means praise 'cause it's hallelujah."
57:23;57:25;"Hallelujah."
57:25;57:26;"- Yeah."
57:26;57:27;"- Praise God."
57:27;57:28;"- Yeah."
57:28;57:29;"- So the whole thing--"
57:29;57:29;"- Praise to the Lord."
57:29;57:30;"- Yeah."
57:30;57:32;"I don't believe in God, so I don't know."
57:32;57:35;"- Well, who do you think put that modello in the fridge?"
57:35;57:37;"- I did, I just didn't remember."
57:37;57:39;"- Well, anyway, so hallelujah means praise God."
57:39;57:40;"- Okay, yeah, yeah."
57:40;57:41;"- We're going deep on this song."
57:41;57:41;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
57:41;57:42;"- You see how deep we got?"
57:42;57:43;"We went from Leonard Cohen to modello."
57:43;57:44;"- In too deep."
57:44;57:46;"- No more, we're not gonna play that anymore."
57:46;57:49;"But so the song, hallelujah means praise God."
57:49;57:50;"And also what's interesting about this,"
57:50;57:51;"we haven't even listened to it yet,"
57:51;57:53;"but this song's got a lot of classic verses."
57:53;57:55;"And all the different versions of this song,"
57:55;57:57;"there's like, all in all, there's like 12 recorded versions"
57:57;58:01;"that he wrote so many verses, and even his version has some,"
58:01;58:04;"and he gave some extra verses to Jeff Buckley."
58:04;58:06;"So the Pentatonix version is cool, 'cause it's short,"
58:06;58:08;"and they just use the most classic verses."
58:08;58:10;"So we're gonna talk about the verses,"
58:10;58:12;"but keep in mind, the chorus is very simple."
58:12;58:17;"♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-ooh ♪"
58:17;58:20;"So basically, let's praise God over and over again."
58:20;58:21;"So let's listen to the first verse"
58:21;58:24;"in the Pentatonix version of hallelujah"
58:24;58:25;"that was tearing up the charts."
58:25;58:26;"- What year?"
58:26;58:27;"- This holiday, this year."
58:27;58:28;"- Yeah."

58:32;58:36;"♪ That David played and it pleased the Lord ♪"

59:14;59:20;"- Hell of an opening verse."
59:20;59:21;"- Yeah."
59:21;59:24;"- One of the best opening verses of all time, in my opinion."
59:24;59:25;"So let's break it down."
59:25;59:28;"I heard there was a secret chord"
59:28;59:31;"that David played and it pleased the Lord,"
59:31;59:33;"but you don't really care for music, do you?"
59:33;59:35;"Okay, so first question, obviously,"
59:35;59:36;"what David are we talking about?"
59:36;59:37;"David Schwimmer?"
59:37;59:40;"That's the first one that comes to mind for me."
59:40;59:42;"Who's your favorite David?"
59:42;59:43;"- Fincher."
59:43;59:45;"- Oh, interesting."
59:45;59:46;"Hell of a director."
59:46;59:50;"But really, what David is he talking about?"
59:50;59:54;"- I don't know my Bible."
59:54;59:57;"The David that Michelangelo sculpted?"
59:57;59:58;"- Yeah, that is the same one."
59:58;59:59;"- The giant David."
59:59;01:00:01;"- Yeah, it's that David."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"He famously killed Goliath."
01:00:04;01:00:04;"- Okay, yeah, that story."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"- With a slingshot."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- Yeah."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- And then he grew up to become King David."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"You've heard of King David, right?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- Yeah."
01:00:10;01:00:12;"- This is the most biblical we've ever gotten on Time Crisis,"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"but you know, the song demands it."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"One thing that I've always found interesting"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"about King David, the character from the Bible,"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"is that he was a warrior king,"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"but also one of his other classic traits"
01:00:24;01:00:25;"was that he was a musician."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"He played the harp."
01:00:27;01:00:31;"So kind of like the godfather of modern Judaism,"
01:00:31;01:00:34;"and then in fact, Christianity as well."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"You know, the whole Abrahamic religions."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"One of these very important father figures"
01:00:38;01:00:43;"was a warrior king who wrote songs and played music,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"which I like."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- Sounds cool."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"- You're not psyched on him."
01:00:49;01:00:53;"And actually, the book of Psalms in the Bible,"
01:00:53;01:00:53;"when you look at it,"
01:00:53;01:00:56;"it's all these short kind of poems,"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"and supposedly David wrote a lot of them."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"And actually in the Bible, in ancient Hebrew or whatever,"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"there's instructions for what the band leader"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"is supposed to do."
01:01:05;01:01:09;"So in some ways, the book of Psalms is like one of the first,"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"is a very early version of a Western album,"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"you know, where there's like a series"
01:01:13;01:01:16;"of these short little poems that have melodies and music,"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"and there's even like little things like,"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"""This one should be played on a harp,"""
01:01:19;01:01:20;"and ""This tuning,"" and stuff."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"So whatever, he was a musician."
01:01:23;01:01:23;"So basically he's saying,"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"""There's a chord that David played,"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"""and it pleased the Lord,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"""but you don't really care for music, do you?"""
01:01:29;01:01:30;"One thing that's interesting about Leonard Cohen"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"is he's always switching perspective."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"You're never sure who the you is."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"He changes verse to verse."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"There's a lot of songwriters, too."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"And then there's a part that goes like this,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"""The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift,"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"""the baffled king composing hallelujah."""
01:01:44;01:01:48;"And as a musician, I'm sure you can explain that."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- He's just doing chromatic ascension?"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- It's not chromatic."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- It's not?"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"- He's just describing the chords."
01:01:53;01:01:57;"He's like, ""If you were in C, the fourth is F,"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"""the fifth is G,"
01:01:59;01:02:03;"""the minor fall he's talking about is A minor."""
01:02:03;01:02:04;"So he's just describing--"
01:02:04;01:02:05;"- You're climbing."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"- I love that part."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"He's just describing the chords that he's playing."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"♪ Goes like this, the fourth, the fifth,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"♪ the minor fall, the major lift ♪"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"So he's just describing the chords that he's playing."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"""The baffled king composing hallelujah."""
01:02:15;01:02:17;"It's hard to put your finger on what it's about,"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"but basically he's talking about King David"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"trying to please God in some sense,"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"and writing a song,"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"and kind of accidentally composing something"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"that praises God, hallelujah."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"But he's talking to somebody who doesn't care about music."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"So the way I always interpreted that"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"is it's two people having a conversation"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"about what does it mean to actually praise God?"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"You can interpret that a lot of different ways too."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"What does it mean to actually honor God"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"if God just means being a good person?"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"Let's listen to the second verse."

01:03:35;01:03:39;"- Second verse."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"Damn, Jake, I'm surprised you don't know"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"more about the Bible."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Is it 'cause you're an atheist?"
01:03:45;01:03:45;"- Yeah."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"(laughing)"
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Born and raised, dude."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"- Born and raised."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- Oh yeah."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- But you celebrated Christmas."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"You never went to church growing up?"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"- A little bit."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- Okay."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"So your faith was strong but you needed proof."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"You saw her bathing on the roof."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"What about just from art history?"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"You learn a little bit about religion from studying art"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"'cause so many great paintings are related to the Bible."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"Do you have any idea what famously in the Bible"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"somebody saw somebody bathing on the roof?"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- No idea."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"- That's a reference to, again, King David,"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"this iconic figure of the Bible."
01:04:16;01:04:21;"He saw a beautiful woman named Bathsheba bathing naked."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"The Bible is really weird when you get into it,"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"as I'm sure all the religious people listening are aware of."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"So basically it's a story in the Bible"
01:04:27;01:04:31;"that King David saw a beautiful naked woman"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"and he decided he needed to have her."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"But she was married."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"- All right."
01:04:38;01:04:42;"- So this famous person in the Bible was an adulterer."
01:04:42;01:04:46;"He had sex with a married woman, got her pregnant."
01:04:46;01:04:51;"Meanwhile, her husband, Uriah, was one of his generals"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"out fighting a war on his behalf."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"- Damn."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"- Sounds like something that a certain"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"president-elect might do."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"It's not good, it's bad."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"Then he had this whole crazy plan to make the guy come back"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"so that the guy would think that the baby was his."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"The whole thing's bananas."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"So King David made some very big mistakes in the Bible."
01:05:10;01:05:13;"The next part, she tied you to a kitchen chair,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"she broke your throne, and she cut your hair."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"You must know the most famous haircut in the Bible."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- Yeah."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"- Who are we talking about?"
01:05:20;01:05:24;"- The guy that was strong and then she cut his hair"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"while he was sleeping and he lost his strength."
01:05:27;01:05:27;"- That's right."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"- Who was that?"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"- Samson and Delilah. - Samson, okay."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"- Samson was a big diesel dude who fought"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"for the Hebrews against the Philistines."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"- God, these stories are so worthless."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"- Well look, man, whether or not you find value"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"in these stories, a couple billion people"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"disagree with you, man."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"- Yeah."
01:05:46;01:05:49;"- I'm sorry it's not a Guided by Voices song."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"- Well, Bob's a better poet."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"- Brutal."
01:05:54;01:05:58;"Anyway, so basically Leonard Cohen conflated two stories"
01:05:58;01:06:02;"from the Bible about men who got into trouble"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"'cause of women."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- Yeah."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- In both those instances, they're talking about"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"people making mistakes, but it ends with,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"and from your lips she drew the hallelujah."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"Like, normally we think in the Bible,"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Samson got tricked by Delilah."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Where's the hallelujah in that?"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"You know, he got did dirty."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"She took away his power when she gave him that haircut."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"- He used to be very diesel, and then after she cut his hair,"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"he had a much more moderate physique"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"and could no longer fight."
01:06:26;01:06:27;"- Yeah."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"- She took away his creatine."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"- Yeah."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"- So anyway, he's putting these kind of negative stories"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"from the Bible and looking for trying to pull out"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"some hallelujah out of that."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"I don't like this."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"What is the point of this?"
01:06:37;01:06:40;"Sometimes stuff sucks, and you don't try to pull"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"a hallelujah out of it."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"- Why not?"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"It's a very pessimistic attitude, Jake."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Aren't we not trying to pull a hallelujah?"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"- We're in Trump's America, dude."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"- You don't wanna look for a reason to be hopeful?"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"- No."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"- You just wanna get your haircut, keep your head down?"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"- No, I don't wanna get my head down, not at all."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"But, I mean, okay, there's a fine line"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"between sugarcoating."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Yeah."
01:07:02;01:07:06;"- And being brutally clear-eyed in your assessments."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"And these Bible stories are confusing."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"And they're just easy just to be like,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"""Oh, it's gonna be fine."""
01:07:13;01:07:14;"- They're confusing if you don't put in the time"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"to go to church, Jake."

01:08:08;01:08:09;"- Break it down."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- Maybe you'll like it better."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Baby, I've been here before."

01:08:19;01:08:21;"I mean, that's pretty simple."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"We broke up."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"- Yep."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"- But that's a nice way to put it."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Kind of got to remember that"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"when you go through a breakup, divorce."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"- I used to walk this floor."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"- Well, it's like,"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"you feel like you're in this new horrible place."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"Actually, you could apply that to Trump's America."
01:08:40;01:08:43;"It's like, don't lose your head."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"You've been here before."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Yep."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"- The world has been here before."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"- Yeah."
01:08:48;01:08:52;"- Wars, famine, hatred, whatever, life's a cycle."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"Leonard Cohen knew that."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"But this is the slightly more interesting part."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"I've seen your flag on the marble arch."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Love is not a victory march."
01:09:00;01:09:04;"It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"What does that make you think of, Jake?"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"'Cause this is interesting to me"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"that this is on a Christmas album."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- Yeah."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"- And that this is this big hit,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"this song that's a new classic."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"- A marble arch?"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"- In the 20th century, can you picture an image"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"of somebody ceremoniously placing a flag"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"on a famous marble arch?"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"- Nazis?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"- Bingo."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- Okay."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- Leonard Cohen's talking about Nazis."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Pentatonix got a song about Nazis."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"- They took over Paris."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"- In the top 40."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"This to me is kind of one of the most moving images"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"of the song."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"'Cause that's like, that's heavy."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"You know, when you go back and see those pictures,"
01:09:42;01:09:47;"the Nazis occupying Paris hung a big old swastika"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"down from the Arc de Triomphe, this triumphal arch."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- Crazy."
01:09:50;01:09:53;"- That's like, you know, that's the equivalent of like,"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"if the Nazis took over New York,"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"threw it down in Washington Square Park."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Brutal."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- Draped it over the Statue of Liberty."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- Yeah, crazy."
01:10:01;01:10:05;"So anyway, he's basically setting something up."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"I've seen your flag on the marble arch."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"Love is not a victory march."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"I guess he's saying Nazis are not love."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Not an original thought."
01:10:14;01:10:18;"A nice way of saying it, but it's interesting."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"He says, it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"So he's saying love isn't a victory march."
01:10:21;01:10:25;"What love is, is a cold and a broken hallelujah."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"- Love is not a victory march."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"It's a cold and broken hallelujah."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"- Yeah."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- I have to say, I'm not blown away with these lyrics."
01:10:33;01:10:36;"I mean, I love that you want to go deep, but I just."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"- Not a fan."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"- What's your interpretation?"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- I think basically he's saying that"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"when people hear the word hallelujah,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"the concept of praise God,"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"you imagine that it feels really good."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"- Yeah."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"- You imagine being in a beautiful place"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"and you feel good and you're praising God"
01:10:50;01:10:51;"and everything feels great."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"But maybe he's saying life isn't like that."
01:10:54;01:10:55;"We literally live in a world"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"where people treat each other terribly."
01:10:56;01:10:59;"We live in a world where Nazis invade Paris"
01:10:59;01:11:03;"and throw a swastika over the Arc de Triomphe."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"We live in this messed up world."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"And that sometimes the way that we praise God"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"is maybe by being kind to each other,"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"staying strong to each other."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I think he's basically saying that sometimes"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"praising God, doing the right thing,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"is sometimes not warm and fuzzy."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"Sometimes it's cold and broken."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"It's like messed up."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Sometimes when you're at your weakest point"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"is when you actually have the most responsibility"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"to be a good person, be kind to each other."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"That's my interpretation."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"- I like that."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"- Let's get the next verse."
01:11:31;01:11:35;"♪ Maybe there's a God above ♪"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"♪ But all I've ever learned from love ♪"

01:11:54;01:11:59;"♪ It's a cut and it's a broken arm ♪"
01:11:59;01:12:04;"- The last verse in the Pentatonix version."
01:12:04;01:12:05;"- Yeah."
01:12:05;01:12:09;"- I feel like you'll like this line, as an atheist."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Maybe there's a God above."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"Interesting sentiment to put on like a Christmas album."

01:36:51;01:36:52;"Absolutely."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Hit me up."
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Yeah, let us know."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Let's talk."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"The number two song."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I love this song, actually."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"It's by Mary Hopkin."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"Those were the days."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Paul McCartney had something to do with this."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"This is based on an old Russian folk song."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"So that's kind of an interesting thing, that there is this-"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"A very Soviet-"
01:37:10;01:37:14;"A very Russian sounding song, 1968, kind of height of the Cold War."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Yeah."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"It's called Those Were the Days."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Obviously the English language-"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Oh yeah, this one."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"...needs to change."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Those were the days."
01:37:21;01:37:24;"This really speaks to me, my Eastern European heritage."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"I feel it."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"We didn't even get into the fact that-"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Once upon a time-"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"The Russians are going to bat for Trump in this election."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"Oh yeah, we forgot them on the list."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Sorry, Russians."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Why is that like a huge story?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"I don't know, man."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"Love the slowdown."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"This is tight."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"It's beautiful."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"Those were the days, my friend."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"That's brutal."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"Interesting."
01:38:38;01:38:42;"That sounds like the song that you sing in the bunker."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:38:44;01:38:47;"It's sad and dark and it's like-"
01:38:47;01:38:48;"You just woke up in a dungeon."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"Yeah."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"It's a song you sing as you're waiting to die."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"Let's look back."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"There's a lot of different ways to look back."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"You could look back with a tone of-"
01:39:10;01:39:18;"You know, Bruce Springsteen wrote a song about having great times in life that are in the past."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"It's called Glory Days."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"The tone of Glory Days is-"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"Glory Days!"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"Yeah, but Glory Days is also a little sad."
01:39:26;01:39:29;"No, it's a little sad, but he compensates for it by-"
01:39:29;01:39:33;"No, it's actually like a totally sad song."
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Okay, but tonally it's-"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"That's the brilliance of that record."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Yeah, beautiful, amazing album."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Shout out to Bruce Springsteen."
01:39:43;01:39:50;"I'm just saying Glory Days makes you think of two guys wistfully looking back and being like,"
01:39:50;01:39:54;"""You know, man, things are alright now, but I'll tell you, we had some times, brother."""
01:39:54;01:39:57;"To throw that speedball past you, bro."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"Yeah, those are two guys throwing back brews and cracking each other up."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"That's how I hear that song."
01:40:03;01:40:07;"This is two people waiting to be murdered by the secret police."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"The song after Glory Days?"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"No, no, this song."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Foreman-"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"No, on the record."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"On the album, what?"
01:40:13;01:40:21;"Foreman says those jobs are going soon, and they ain't coming back to your hometown."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"I thought of that song-"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"In my hometown."
01:40:24;01:40:28;"I thought of My Hometown on election night, because Trump's whole thing is like,"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"""We're going to bring these jobs back."""
01:40:30;01:40:31;"Right."
01:40:31;01:40:34;"And then like 32 years ago, there was that record from Springsteen."
01:40:34;01:40:37;"He was like, ""Foreman says these jobs are going, son."""
01:40:37;01:40:39;"They ain't coming back."
01:40:39;01:40:42;"They ain't coming back."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"This is your hometown."
01:40:44;01:40:50;"By the way, if nobody brings the jobs back, which we should think is a distinct possibility,"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"we got to take care of people."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"That's also what's so dumb."
01:40:53;01:40:54;"Jobs, jobs, jobs."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Yes, please try to bring jobs back."
01:40:56;01:41:01;"But if we can't bring jobs back, can't let people starve, we got to take care of each other."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Good Lord."
01:41:03;01:41:06;"Maybe the Rust Belt is going to stay rusty."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"I don't know."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"Maybe there won't be a boom in manufacturing."
01:41:11;01:41:18;"A lot of the new big industries like tech don't require thousands of people slaving away in a factory."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"So what does that mean?"
01:41:19;01:41:25;"Did we really build a capitalist system that's so brutal that robot trucks are going to make"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"people starve?"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"Come on."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"We're all going to be making each other hamburgers."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"Anyway, back to the amazing year of 2016."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"What are we, number two right now?"
01:41:35;01:41:44;"Number two, the weekend with Starboy, Jake's pick for the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate,"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"the first Canadian in the White House."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:47;01:41:50;"We need a Starboy on the DNC ticket."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"That song's cool."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"It's cool."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"What was that lyric?"
01:42:10;01:42:17;"That was the weekend telling you, Jake, that your income that you made in the entire year, he made in one week."
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Okay."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I believe that."
01:42:20;01:42:30;"Just so everybody who's listening is clear, your yearly income, to him, he made minimum that in one week."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"What's he pulling down a year, you think?"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"That's a good question."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"I would guess he's been really killing on the charts lately."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Like 15 million?"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"That's a great guess."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"30 million?"
01:42:41;01:42:49;"I would guess the weekend makes between 15 and 40, depending on how he invests and how many appearances he does and stuff."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"The weekend could easily make 30 million in a year."
01:42:51;01:42:54;"So if he makes, let's say, 20 million a year."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Yeah."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"So 20 divided by how many weeks are in a year?"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"52."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"What's he pulling down?"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"He's probably making more in a week."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"Can we get a number crunch?"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"Oh, you know what?"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"I'm going to use the calculator on my phone."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"I love using my phone."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"20 million."
01:43:05;01:43:08;"It's like 40, or no, it's like 400,000 a week."
01:43:08;01:43:11;"15 million divided by 52."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"384,000."
01:43:12;01:43:17;"So the weekend makes about $961,000 in a week."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Oh."
01:43:18;01:43:22;"And that's how much most of the people listening to that song make in a whole year."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"Yeah, I'm making about--"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"About a mil."
01:43:24;01:43:29;"I'm making just under 900 grand a year."
01:43:29;01:43:32;"Okay, but to be fair to The Weeknd, his logic stands."
01:43:32;01:43:38;"The Weeknd is saying that he made your whole year in a week."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"He made what I make in 20 years."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"In a week."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"The Weeknd made your whole year--"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"20 years?"
01:43:46;01:43:51;"If he was keeping it real, The Weeknd would say, ""I made your whole year in a second."""
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Right."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"Like--"
01:43:53;01:44:00;"I played one song at some stupid PepsiCo event and made what you make in a year or two."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"No, honestly, The Weeknd, because he has these hit songs on the radio,"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"you make a lot of money from royalties."
01:44:05;01:44:09;"So basically, The Weeknd could literally just be sitting in a chair"
01:44:09;01:44:15;"and say to you or almost anybody, ""What you make in a whole year,"
01:44:15;01:44:20;"what you make working at Dunkin' Donuts, I just made."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"Did it again. I did it again."""
01:44:22;01:44:26;"It's not even-- Yeah, The Weeknd should be more proud of himself."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"But to be fair, his logic stands."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"He's not saying-- He doesn't want to blow up a spot too hard."
01:44:31;01:44:36;"No, but he's also not saying that I made your entire yearly income."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"That's exactly what I made in a week."
01:44:38;01:44:42;"So let's say-- Okay, so the average American makes $52,000 a year."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"A thousand a week."
01:44:43;01:44:47;"The Weeknd's not saying, ""I only make $52,000 a year."""
01:44:47;01:44:51;"He's saying, ""I make at least $52,000 a year."""
01:44:51;01:44:52;"A week."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"He's saying, ""I make at least $52,000 a week."""
01:44:54;01:44:57;"Turns out he makes a lot more than $52,000 a year."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"He's making $52,000 a day."
01:45:00;01:45:04;"Yeah, that'd be-- Well, make $52,000 a half day."
01:45:04;01:45:05;"He should have said that."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"""I make-- I make-- $52,000 and a half day."""
01:45:08;01:45:13;"That would be groundbreaking, the first Canadian president of America."
01:45:13;01:45:18;"Just please consider that the wealth you're amassing could be a detriment"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"unless you go full Trump."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"But we don't want The Weeknd to go full Trump."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"No, man."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"But he's an artist. He's got a more sensitive soul."
01:45:26;01:45:27;"That's true."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"He wouldn't go there."
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Trump's not an artist."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"He doesn't--"
01:45:30;01:45:33;"Yeah, far from it."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"The Weeknd does have a sensitive soul."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"He's a time crisis favorite."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"Thank you for the music."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"The number one song this week--"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Of '68."
01:45:41;01:45:45;"In 1968, it's called ""Hey, Dude."""
01:45:45;01:45:47;"♪ Hey, dude ♪"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"And it's by the--"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"♪ Don't-- ♪"

01:45:52;01:45:54;"""Hey, Jude"" by The Beatles."
01:45:54;01:45:59;"So I feel like a month or two ago on the show, we listened to ""Hey, Jude."""
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Yeah, I guess it popped back up on the charts."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Maybe it wasn't number one at that point."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Maybe it was number one."

01:46:39;01:46:43;"and then, like, see Trump get elected, and then you're in your, like, '70s,"
01:46:43;01:46:44;"and you're just like, ""What?"""
01:46:44;01:46:45;"Here's a question."
01:46:45;01:46:49;"Do you think Paul would accept an invitation to the Trump White House?"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"That's a great question."
01:46:50;01:46:53;"Honestly, I'm not convinced he has the moral fiber to say no."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"No, he would go."

01:47:08;01:47:09;"So did they let him use that?"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"I don't know if you were, like, too depressed or, like, hammered and crashed out."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"No, I remember."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"No, but on election night."
01:47:14;01:47:15;"I was a little high, yeah."
01:47:15;01:47:21;"I was blindingly drunk, but I was watching his speech at the end of the night,"
01:47:21;01:47:25;"and he--and so at the end of the night, they--actually, a surprisingly gracious speech."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"It was a little bit like--"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Don't be surprised."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"It was like, ""Who is this guy? Who--"""

01:47:31;01:47:36;"Okay, so at the end, they play ""You can't always get what you want"" at the end."

01:47:40;01:47:42;"""Oh, they used 'You can't always get what you want.'"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"I wonder if they're going to have us play it at the White House."""

01:47:45;01:47:46;"Mick Jagger tweeted that?"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"And then someone was just, like--all these comedians were just, like--"

01:48:08;01:48:09;"I feel like--"
01:48:09;01:48:14;"The real test is going to be in a year or two deep, when it's, like, a state dinner,"

01:48:17;01:48:21;"Jake, you and I, we're going to make an on-air promise."
01:48:21;01:48:26;"Will you roll up to any functions at the Trump White House?"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"No."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"You promise?"
01:48:28;01:48:33;"I'm really going on a limb here, because I get a lot of invites from the White House."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"So you're saying you're going to turn them down?"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Hot property. Yep."
01:48:36;01:48:43;"What if it's a state dinner? What if Trump is hosting a Modelo tribute to Don Henley?"
01:48:43;01:48:48;"It's all-you-can-drink Modelo. Don Henley will be in attendance."
01:48:48;01:48:53;"He's getting the Congressional Medal of Honor for his artistic contribution to the United States."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"That's right."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"I'm not there."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"You passed the test."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"Can you imagine, though, being, like, some legendary artist?"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"You know, because they give out these--"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"The Kennedy Center Award."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"Yeah, and, like, the Congressional Medal of Honor for whatever it is."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Medal of Freedom, whatever the hell it is."
01:49:08;01:49:11;"Obama gave it to Bob Dylan, yada, yada."
01:49:11;01:49:18;"Can you imagine being, like, I don't know, John Fogerty from Creedence Clearwater?"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"Oh, God."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"You know, or something like that?"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"And then, like, Trump's a big fan."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"I'll tell you one thing about that."
01:49:25;01:49:28;"I went to the White House. I met President Trump."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"We didn't talk politics one bit, man."
01:49:31;01:49:34;"We talked music, talked a little bit of real estate."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"You know, I like to golf."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"I've been to some of his resorts."
01:49:38;01:49:41;"But listen, Howard, it was not political, man."
01:49:41;01:49:46;"President Trump--and you know the thing is I thought I wasn't going to like Vice President Pence."
01:49:46;01:49:50;"Because, you know, he's an extraordinarily homophobic, violent man."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"But you know what? He likes my records too, man."
01:49:52;01:49:55;"And he actually plays a little bass."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Don't do it."
01:49:57;01:50:01;"I actually did a version of Lodi in the Rose Garden."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"Oh, man, but Fogerty for real, what a hypocrite."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"The guy who wrote ""Fortunate Son."""
01:50:07;01:50:14;"Okay, anybody who's just tuning in, we're just speculating what would happen if John Fogerty was invited to the Trump White House."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"So would Paul go? I mean--"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Would Paul go?"
01:50:16;01:50:21;"I could imagine Paul just playing the, like, oh, I'm not American."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"Lennon wouldn't have gone."
01:50:23;01:50:24;"Lennon wouldn't have gone."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"And that's why Lennon's the better artist."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Oh!"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"Well, Hulk, okay."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"Straight up."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"The gauntlet's been laid down."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"But also, but seriously, when you consider how--"
01:50:35;01:50:40;"We're talking Lennon-McCartney in relation to Trump."
01:50:40;01:50:46;"I mean, look, this is time crisis. We have to have our little diversions to keep our sanity."
01:50:46;01:50:53;"The truth is many, many people, for good reason, especially people from oppressed groups, are absolutely terrified."
01:50:53;01:50:57;"Even my people, even the Jews are starting to get a little scared."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"We'll talk about that some other time."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"So John Fogerty, Paul McCartney."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Don't go."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Think about the terror."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"All you have to do is just talk to a few people."
01:51:07;01:51:12;"Think about the visceral terror and pain people are feeling already."
01:51:12;01:51:15;"All you have to do is say, ""I'm busy."""
01:51:15;01:51:16;"Just don't go."
01:51:16;01:51:28;"So all prominent and legendary artists, do not let Trump co-opt your power and your artistic vision for his crappy administration."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Amen. Hallelujah."
01:51:30;01:51:32;"The number one song--"
01:51:32;01:51:37;"This is maybe one of the biggest connections we've ever had for two number one songs."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"Okay, so ""Hey Jude."""
01:51:38;01:51:44;"The number one song in 1968 was ""Hey Jude"" by the Beatles."
01:51:44;01:51:52;"The number one song in 2016 is Ray Shremard with ""Black Beatles."""
01:51:52;01:51:53;"Are you familiar with this song, Jake?"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"No."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"Is it spelled like the bug, double E?"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"No, no, no."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"They're basically saying we're the Black Beatles, like the band."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"Ray Shremard, great."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Two Brothers, produced by Mike Will."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I don't know who this is."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"What's their name?"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Ray Shremard."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"How do you spell that?"
01:52:16;01:52:17;"Their first big hit was--"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"It's ""Drummers Ear Backwards."""
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Okay, Jesus."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Okay, their first big hit was ""No Flex Zone."""
01:52:23;01:52:25;"No flex zone, they know that."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"You remember that?"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"No."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"Okay, they've had a lot of hits."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"They're good."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"They're youngish guys."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"You're in."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"I'm in."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"And this song, ""Black Beatles,"" was on their latest album."
01:52:36;01:52:42;"At first, it wasn't doing great, but then it rose to prominence because of this viral sensation called the Mannequin Challenge,"
01:52:42;01:52:47;"where people do a video where they play this song and everybody freezes in a room,"
01:52:47;01:52:50;"as if the camera is moving through a room full of mannequins."
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Are you familiar with this?"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"No."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"It's a hell of a viral meme-sation."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"You should check it out."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Even Paul McCartney did one."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Did I get it?"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"No."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"This song sucks."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"Oh, my God."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"What the hell is this song?"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"You're just hearing it for the first time, man."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"There's a million songs that sound like that."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"That's not true."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"What's unique about it?"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"The lyrics."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"I don't care about lyrics."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"Oh."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"You know that."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"You know that about me."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"I didn't know that."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"I thought you cared about lyrics, bro."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"No, I don't."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Well, maybe you should start."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Oh, shots fired."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Language."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"Shots fired."
01:54:12;01:54:19;"Language, the way we express ourselves through art, through even just what we say to each other, it's important."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"Words have power, my friend."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"What are the lyrics to that song?"
01:54:22;01:54:28;"Well, it starts out, he says, ""Black Beatles in the city, and then immediately to confiscate the money."""
01:54:28;01:54:32;"And then later there's a part where he goes, ""She says she love me."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"I think she's trolling."""
01:54:34;01:54:35;"What's cool about these lyrics?"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"I don't understand."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"These lyrics suck."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Okay, first of all, that's a very modern phenomenon."
01:54:39;01:54:45;"I've had people tell me they love me before, and somewhere in my heart, I knew they were trolling me."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"That's not modern, dude."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"That's as old as the sands of time, dude."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"You're right."
01:54:50;01:54:55;"There have been people who have been making false declarations of love since time immemorial."
01:54:55;01:55:01;"But the concept of trolling, that has a uniquely 2016 flavor to it."
01:55:01;01:55:07;"In the most pedantic, lame way."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Spoken like somebody who's never been brutally trolled."
01:55:10;01:55:14;"Um, on the internet, that's true."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"But you've been trolled in real life?"
01:55:17;01:55:18;"Sure."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"Has anybody ever said, ""I love you,"" and you thought that they were trolling you?"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"No, actually no."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"Has anybody said, ""I love you,"" and they meant it, and then later they trolled you?"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"Not intentionally."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"Okay."
01:55:29;01:55:30;"What about you?"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"I've been trolled and rolled."
01:55:32;01:55:36;"So wait, so someone said, ""I love you,"" to you, and at that time you were like, ""Do you?"""
01:55:36;01:55:45;"I've never had somebody who consistently expressed love to me over months or years who I ever doubted."
01:55:45;01:55:50;"And I'd like to think that I've never said it to anybody with anything other than pure intentions."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Yeah."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"Love is funny, man."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"Without a heart, I could be so free."
01:55:56;01:56:01;"I wouldn't feel no pain for others to free."
01:56:01;01:56:06;"Without a heart, I wouldn't care at all."
01:56:06;01:56:12;"And people go out there, or someone's home, to swear."
01:56:12;01:56:21;"The only thing I've ever done is, without a heart, without a heart, without a heart,"
01:56:21;01:56:26;"without a heart, I could love no one."
01:56:26;01:56:30;"No, I could love no one."
01:56:30;01:56:37;"I could make a lot of money, spend it on street machines, pitch a penny off a car loan,"
01:56:37;01:56:40;"hold a fortune that I could bring."
01:56:40;01:56:45;"I wouldn't need a private teacher if it was just to take a shine."
01:56:45;01:56:50;"I would never let my finger, I would never swing a dime."
01:56:50;01:56:54;"Without a heart, I could love no one."
01:57:02;01:57:05;"Without a heart, I could love no one."
01:57:05;01:57:32;"No, no, no, no, I could love no one."
01:57:32;01:57:39;"I could make a lot of money, pitch a penny off a car loan,"
01:57:39;01:57:43;"hold a fortune that I could bring."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"Time to wrap it up."
01:58:07;01:58:10;"Truthfully, we hope everybody's doing okay."
01:58:10;01:58:17;"And, you know, if you ever want to talk, obviously, can't respond to every tweet,"
01:58:17;01:58:21;"but if you're a time crisis listener and you ever want to--if you're really feeling bad about something"
01:58:21;01:58:27;"or related to our current state of affairs, or you can track down Jake's email, you know."
01:58:27;01:58:31;"It's important that we all, like, stick together and talk and debate and blah, blah, blah."
01:58:31;01:58:35;"Anyway, okay, let's take one positive note to end on."
01:58:35;01:58:38;"We are going to work to expand voting."
01:58:38;01:58:40;"Yes."
01:58:40;01:58:41;"That's the time crisis promise."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"That seems like a good goal, right?"
01:58:43;01:58:44;"Obviously, anybody listening to the show--"
01:58:44;01:58:45;"Let's make that a theme of the show."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"We're two knuckleheads."
01:58:46;01:58:47;"Yeah."
01:58:47;01:58:53;"We're just two regular guys who spend our time making paintings, writing songs, hanging out."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Going forward with the show, let's make that a theme."
01:58:55;01:58:56;"We're just two regular guys who are going to research--"
01:58:56;01:58:59;"Nobody respects women more than I do."
01:58:59;01:59:00;"Never forget."
01:59:00;01:59:04;"We're going to research, and we're just going to be two regular guys who are going to say that that's--"
01:59:04;01:59:10;"We're going to do plenty of other stuff in our lives, but the time crisis pet project--"
01:59:10;01:59:11;"Yep."
01:59:11;01:59:17;"--is learning the best ways to support voting rights because we are--"
01:59:17;01:59:18;"I love it."
01:59:18;01:59:19;"--in agreement."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Voter suppression played a role in this election."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"Let's get some people on the horn in future episodes."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"I want to talk to some people in North Carolina."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"Totally."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"All right."
01:59:29;01:59:30;"Bye."
01:59:30;01:59:31;"Peace."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"Beats Juan."
