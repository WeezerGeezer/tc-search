00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On this episode we finally go deep on an iconic American chain."
00:08;00:11;"A pizzeria called Domino's."
00:11;00:15;"We talk about its origins, its future, and everything in between."
00:15;00:22;"We avoid the Noid and listen to some great music from Billy Joel, Three Dog Night, and The Jackson 5."
00:22;00:25;"That was Michael Jackson's band. This is"
00:25;00:27;"TIME CRISIS"
00:27;00:29;"WITH ESRA KAYNIG"
01:08;01:19;"Time Crisis back once again. What's up Jake?"
01:19;01:21;"Not much, how are you?"
01:21;01:23;"I'm alright, business as usual."
01:23;01:26;"Typical low energy start to the show."
01:26;01:28;"We'll get in our groove."
01:28;01:31;"Don't want to hit them with too much off the top."
01:31;01:33;"Nothing prepped for the top."
01:33;01:35;"I never know what to say when you're like, ""What's up Jake?"""
01:35;01:40;"I'm just like, was cleaning out a paintbrush like five minutes ago."
01:40;01:42;"Just wrapping up work for the day."
01:42;01:45;"Poured myself a mezcal on the rocks here."
01:45;01:46;"Okay."
01:46;01:48;"You know, I've been working by myself for the last eight hours."
01:48;01:52;"I haven't talked to anyone for a while, so I need to kind of transition."
01:52;01:54;"So the first ten minutes of the show might be a little rocky."
01:54;01:57;"I wonder if any TC heads have picked up on this different energy that"
01:57;02:00;"now that Jake records at his studio,"
02:00;02:03;"we kind of get to witness this full transition"
02:03;02:07;"from working man into radio personality."
02:07;02:09;"Yeah, it's not a smooth transition."
02:09;02:12;"I don't know, the engine's a little cold right now."
02:12;02:15;"It's going to take a few tries to turn it over,"
02:15;02:17;"or whatever dumb metaphor you want to apply."
02:17;02:19;"So what's up guys?"
02:19;02:22;"Good to see some peeps on the screen."
02:22;02:24;"Some people on FaceTime."
02:24;02:26;"Oh yeah, very intimate."
02:26;02:29;"I'm drinking the last Stella Artois that was in my fridge."
02:29;02:31;"Okay, you've been working on those for a second."
02:31;02:35;"I feel like you were drinking that when you were dressed in your British tracksuit."
02:35;02:36;"Exactly."
02:36;02:39;"Well, I guess we can jump right in because"
02:39;02:43;"we got some pretty deep stuff to get into today."
02:43;02:48;"The first thing is that Domino's is bringing back the Noid."
02:48;02:53;"It's a sentence that either is immediately filling somebody with joy or dread,"
02:53;02:57;"or truly is so deeply meaningless to the listener."
02:57;03:00;"But I guess before we even talk about the Noid,"
03:00;03:02;"I don't think we've ever talked too much about Domino's,"
03:02;03:04;"which is kind of surprising."
03:04;03:06;"Major oversight."
03:06;03:09;"Corporate food history."
03:09;03:11;"Let's talk about it."
03:11;03:17;"I have somewhat warm feelings towards Domino's personally."
03:17;03:20;"I don't know. I feel like my family was cool with it."
03:20;03:22;"We would order Domino's,"
03:22;03:25;"and I just had a sense of, ""I guess Domino's is okay."""
03:25;03:29;"Was your family snobby about other chain fast food places?"
03:29;03:31;"Yeah, I know."
03:31;03:34;"Even though she eventually felt like she had to take us,"
03:34;03:37;"I know my mom was not psyched about taking us to McDonald's."
03:37;03:41;"That felt like, ""Okay, fine, but this is not cool."""
03:41;03:44;"Whereas Domino's, I don't know."
03:44;03:47;"Domino's was just our local pizza chain."
03:47;03:50;"I always felt like I would see commercials for Little Caesars,"
03:50;03:52;"Papa John's, that kind of sh*t,"
03:52;03:56;"and I would just be like, ""I have no idea where this is. It looks sick."""
03:56;04:01;"Maybe it was just on the wrong highway strip mall from where we lived."
04:01;04:03;"So, I don't know."
04:03;04:06;"I only really felt like I had experience with Domino's."
04:06;04:09;"What were the occasions that would result"
04:09;04:12;"in your parents choosing Domino's over a local"
04:12;04:16;"northern New Jersey mom-and-pop pizzeria?"
04:16;04:19;"That's a great question. I literally was just thinking that."
04:19;04:22;"Surely, you must have patronized those spots as well."
04:22;04:25;"Oh, yeah. Vinny's in Bloomfield, New Jersey."
04:25;04:29;"Vinny's. It's so on the nose."
04:29;04:31;"Just straight up."
04:31;04:35;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch? Is Vinny's in Bloomfield still open?"
04:35;04:37;"I don't know. Domino's reminds me of Dunkin' Donuts."
04:37;04:40;"I guess maybe just because it's two brands that I have slightly warm associations with"
04:40;04:45;"from childhood, where I weirdly think of them as being kind of classy,"
04:45;04:48;"but I know that's not the majority opinion."
04:48;04:49;"That's weird."
04:49;04:51;"Actually, Pizza Hut seemed harsher to me."
04:51;04:54;"Domino's seemed like slightly better pizza."
04:54;04:57;"Although, whatever. I came around to Pizza Hut."
04:57;04:59;"There's something about Domino's. I don't know."
04:59;05:01;"The branding seemed kind of..."
05:01;05:03;"It actually seemed like decent quality ingredients,"
05:03;05:05;"but then when you actually go to a Domino's,"
05:05;05:09;"it reminds me so much of off-track betting."
05:09;05:14;"Just that kind of weird vibe of you step in, there's this counter."
05:14;05:17;"It's always kind of dingy in the place where you hang out."
05:17;05:22;"It feels a little bit like being at Port Authority or something."
05:22;05:23;"Like a bus depot."
05:23;05:27;"That same vibe of kind of like, ""We don't want you here. Keep it moving."""
05:27;05:28;"Right."
05:28;05:30;"Vinny's is still going strong, by the way."
05:30;05:32;"Vinny's on... Was it on Broad Street?"
05:32;05:33;"Yeah."
05:33;05:34;"They're still in business."
05:34;05:36;"Okay. That's great."
05:36;05:38;"Yeah, I thought Vinny's was pretty good."
05:38;05:40;"I mean, what were you hitting, Jake?"
05:40;05:43;"I was going to say, Domino's is quick."
05:43;05:44;"Domino's is quick."
05:44;05:49;"If you're in a pinch and you need the food there pronto, you go to Domino's."
05:49;05:50;"Domino's."
05:50;05:52;"Seinfeld, quick number crunch,"
05:52;05:55;"Antonio's in Southbury, Connecticut,"
05:55;05:56;"because that was our spot."
05:56;05:59;"We didn't have a chain pizza zone in Southbury."
05:59;06:03;"Our pizzeria is basically always somebody's name."
06:03;06:05;"Well, there was another one called Pizza Villa,"
06:05;06:08;"who actually sponsored one of the Little League teams."
06:08;06:11;"I also thought that was cool to play for Pizza Villa."
06:11;06:12;"Yeah."
06:12;06:14;"It looks like Antonio's is still going too."
06:14;06:15;"Cool."
06:15;06:18;"Is this the original Antonio's on East Hill?"
06:18;06:20;"I couldn't tell you the street, but..."
06:20;06:23;"Yeah, the classic pizzeria is somebody's name."
06:23;06:28;"Yeah, like a Mexican restaurant tends to be like..."
06:28;06:32;"I mean, I feel like one of the local places in my part of Jersey was called like Mexicali Rose."
06:32;06:33;"Evocative name."
06:33;06:36;"Evocative. Yeah, Chinese restaurants tend to have..."
06:36;06:40;"Like, they really would name the restaurant like something house."
06:40;06:43;"I love thinking about the choices to name restaurants."
06:43;06:47;"We had a cool Mexican restaurant near our house called Tortilla Flat,"
06:47;06:51;"which is, I believe, a reference to the John Steinbeck novel."
06:51;06:59;"This got me thinking about the naming conventions for Irish pubs."
06:59;07:00;"It's usually a last name, right?"
07:00;07:05;"Yeah, or isn't it always like the Fox and the Fiddle or like the Fryer and the..."
07:05;07:07;"Well, that's like... There's a lot of English ones."
07:07;07:08;"I don't know. Irish like that too."
07:08;07:11;"The English ones that are like two funny things."
07:11;07:14;"The Cat and the Fiddle, the Something and the Something."
07:14;07:15;"Pizzeria are usually people's names."
07:15;07:16;"I mean, well, let's start..."
07:16;07:18;"Italian Dynasty."
07:18;07:19;"Yeah, right."
07:19;07:20;"I feel like..."
07:20;07:21;"Yeah, exactly."
07:21;07:22;"Because that's like... There's like a classic..."
07:22;07:26;"A Chinese restaurant could easily be called Hunan Dynasty."
07:26;07:32;"And like, I'm trying to think of just something taken from like Italian history."
07:32;07:33;"Mount Etna."
07:33;07:35;"Would there be something like that?"
07:35;07:38;"Like a pizzeria named after a mountain."
07:38;07:40;"Just like Renaissance pizzeria."
07:40;07:43;"I mean, Little Caesar's is a little bit like that, isn't it?"
07:43;07:45;"Right, but that's when you get into the chain."
07:45;07:49;"I kind of respect Little Caesar's like referencing Roman history."
07:49;07:51;"And they had like a cool mascot."
07:51;07:54;"Yeah, well, what was that mascot called?"
07:54;07:55;"He was Little Caesar."
07:55;07:56;"Little Caesar?"
07:56;07:57;"Yeah."
07:57;07:58;"It's his spot."
07:58;07:59;"Oh, was he Little Caesar?"
07:59;08:01;"Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
08:01;08:03;"My name is Little Caesar."
08:03;08:06;"My friends call me LC."
08:06;08:09;"My daddy's name is Sandy."
08:09;08:12;"They passed it on to me."
08:12;08:15;"I'm a good buddy, funny buddy."
08:15;08:18;"Wants to be your friend."
08:18;08:20;"I'm up to a happy ending."
08:20;08:23;"I'm you for you."
08:23;08:26;"I do it good."
08:26;08:29;"There was a Little Caesar's in the Kmart in my town."
08:29;08:30;"Little Caesar's in the Kmart?"
08:30;08:35;"Yeah, Little Caesar's inside the Kmart that my buddies and I would hit a few times in high school."
08:35;08:36;"Oh, boy."
08:36;08:41;"It's like Friday night, like hanging out at like Jared's house."
08:41;08:44;"Let's roll over to Kmart, get some pizza."
08:44;08:47;"Oh, yeah, get some two liters of Mountain Dew."
08:47;08:48;"I didn't drink in high school at all."
08:48;08:52;"So I was like, in fact, one time we went, oh my God, this is such a random memory."
08:52;08:56;"One time we went to the Little Caesar's in the Kmart in my town."
08:56;09:00;"For some reason we thought it'd be really funny if we dressed in camo."
09:00;09:05;"Because my friend Jared was really into, I don't know, like military technology."
09:05;09:09;"He wanted to go, my friend Jared, growing up, he wanted to go into the army."
09:09;09:11;"Okay, he's a classic army dude."
09:11;09:12;"Yeah, he was an army guy."
09:12;09:16;"And he was like, it's so funny because this is in the 90s."
09:16;09:18;"He was like, yeah, man, I'm a Republican."
09:18;09:20;"And I was like, okay, cool, whatever that means."
09:20;09:23;"When you're like 15 or 16 or whatever."
09:23;09:28;"And then he went to this military academy after he graduated high school for like a week."
09:28;09:30;"And then he was like, this sucks."
09:30;09:35;"And like went home, back to Southberry and worked at the Home Depot in Danbury for a year."
09:35;09:36;"And then reapplied to college."
09:36;09:42;"But anyway, we went to the Little Caesar's one time, dressed in camo because he had like just tons of camo."
09:42;09:44;"Even put on like camo face paint."
09:44;09:45;"Whoa."
09:45;09:46;"I know, it was really weird."
09:46;09:48;"You're like 16 in like a weird town."
09:48;09:51;"You might end up in jail today if you did that."
09:51;09:52;"No, I know, it'd be weird."
09:52;09:53;"We weren't armed."
09:53;09:57;"I don't think Connecticut is open here."
09:57;10:01;"We got a local high school militia entering the Kmart."
10:01;10:05;"No, looking back on that now, from our 16 year old brain."
10:05;10:07;"Oh yeah, no, absolutely."
10:07;10:14;"From our 16 year old brain perspective in 1993 or whatever, it was funny to put on camo and face paint."
10:14;10:16;"And like go to like the Kmart and pick up pizza."
10:16;10:18;"Like pick up for Jared."
10:18;10:24;"It's interesting to look back on that memory and like it would have a different valence today."
10:24;10:26;"Well, yeah, it's before like, I mean."
10:26;10:27;"School shootings."
10:27;10:31;"Before school shootings, before the Oklahoma City bombing."
10:31;10:32;"Early Clinton years."
10:32;10:34;"I guess it was like a year before that."
10:34;10:40;"It was actually the Clinton years where people really started getting freaked out about this concept of militias."
10:40;10:41;"Right, yeah."
10:41;10:46;"I think for us it was more of like a weird, funny, like art, like punk prank."
10:46;10:48;"Right."
10:48;10:54;"Today you would have been like suspended from school for three months and people would be asking like, ""Who radicalized Jake?"""
10:54;10:58;"You'd just be like, ""It was a punk prank and we just wanted to get some Little Caesars."""
10:58;11:02;"Oh my God."
11:02;11:05;"Yeah, it would have been like on the internet."
11:05;11:07;"There would have been like dumb like footage."
11:07;11:09;"That would have gone very sideways."
11:09;11:15;"Look at these radicalized teens in Connecticut going like in the Kmart wearing camo and be like, ""Wait, what?"""
11:15;11:17;"You're like, ""We weren't armed, man."""
11:17;11:19;"It's so weird to think about that."
11:19;11:21;"That was such a good, deep memory I just pulled out."
11:21;11:25;"Maybe one day, because we were texting earlier, you're working on some new brews."
11:25;11:34;"And maybe one day there'll be a brews EP that's truly like just, it's your kind of like in remembrance of things past."
11:34;11:37;"Just like looking back at childhood memories."
11:37;11:41;"There'll be one camo in the Kmart about that memory."
11:41;11:42;"Oh, that's good."
11:42;11:46;"We wore camo in the Kmart."
11:46;11:54;"Yeah, because we would like make like, we would try to like remake like Rambo, like using like his dad's VHS camcorder."
11:54;11:59;"Just like try to film action sequences and stuff in the woods."
11:59;12:08;"That reminds me, very early, I wonder what grade you first would even be encouraged to like write a story."
12:08;12:10;"Like second grade?"
12:10;12:11;"Yeah, something."
12:11;12:19;"I can really picture that like big fat paper they would give you that would be like two solid lines with like a perforated one in the middle."
12:19;12:24;"That you were you kind of trying to learn how to do cursive by learning the upper half and the bottom half."
12:24;12:28;"So I have some memory of being told we had to write stories."
12:28;12:29;"Yeah, I feel like second grade."
12:29;12:31;"So, you know, handwriting still pretty f***ed."
12:31;12:41;"And I have this memory of already, you know, experiencing how compromised art can be once it leaves your head and you're thinking about an audience."
12:41;12:46;"That I feel like I was writing some kooky story that felt kind of like me."
12:46;12:49;"And I don't know why, because I was so not into any of this stuff."
12:49;12:55;"I felt like I needed to write a kind of like boyish story."
12:55;12:57;"And I wrote a story called Army Guys."
12:57;13:02;"And I just remember just like knowing absolutely nothing about the military."
13:02;13:04;"Being mostly uninterested in it."
13:04;13:11;"It had a bit of an allure because like nobody in my life would like let me get toy guns or even like military stuff."
13:11;13:15;"I have a memory of like being at a store with my grandpa and you know, like a supermarket in the Bronx."
13:15;13:17;"And him being like, you want to get a coloring book?"
13:17;13:18;"And I was like, yeah."
13:18;13:20;"And I kind of went for like this G.I. Joe one."
13:20;13:21;"He was like, not that one."
13:21;13:24;"I was like, come on, man, please."
13:24;13:27;"- Oh, your grandpa was shutting down the G.I. Joe?"
13:27;13:28;"- Wow."
13:28;13:30;"I wonder what his perspective was."
13:30;13:33;"That grandfather, I think he was in the Navy."
13:33;13:37;"He did some, obviously like everybody that generation, he did something in World War II."
13:37;13:39;"He might've just been like, seems violent."
13:39;13:44;"I don't think he was on some like deep like pacifist thing necessarily."
13:44;13:47;"I think he probably just looked at that and was like, what are all these guns?"
13:47;13:48;"You know, it seems violent."
13:48;13:52;"Or maybe he was a Cobra sympathizer."
13:52;13:55;"Maybe he'd been radicalized to the Cobra side."
13:55;14:02;"- Did you feel like a pressure to like write like a masculine, like male story?"
14:02;14:03;"- I think so."
14:03;14:07;"I think I had a feeling like, oh, that's like, there's something cool about that."
14:07;14:09;"But I knew my heart wasn't quite in it."
14:09;14:13;"But yeah, like what the (beep) would I have known about the military?"
14:13;14:19;"And I'm sure it was like some very vague, like the army guys are on a mission"
14:19;14:22;"and they're climbing up a hill."
14:22;14:24;"Oh no, one of the army guys got lost."
14:24;14:27;"I'm sure it was like totally meaningless."
14:27;14:32;"But yeah, those are like the kind of symbols that like loomed large in childhood."
14:32;14:35;"Maybe because of just like stuff like GI Joe or going over to some kid's house."
14:35;14:38;"He's got like all these like crazy guns."
14:38;14:44;"And you know, it's that's such like a classic boy toy or like those little green army dudes"
14:44;14:47;"with the, where their feet are on a platform."
14:47;14:51;"So probably just having some sense of like, oh yeah, this is like an important thing,"
14:51;14:54;"but probably having zero context for it."
14:54;14:57;"- I mean, it goes to show, man, you're growing up in a militaristic empire."
14:57;15:00;"- Yeah, who knows what I, I don't know."
15:03;15:06;"(rapping)"
15:12;15:14;"Pray for sins, I might move wrong"
15:14;15:15;"Roll up them tens, hair, and the clouds"
15:15;15:17;"And the b**** that I saw in the crowd"
15:17;15:19;"Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud"
15:19;15:21;"I told you so, get mad I told her"
15:21;15:23;"Big AK's like GI Joe"
15:23;15:25;"V-fake like CGI"
15:25;15:27;"Bust coats like TDE"
15:27;15:28;"Tuck that stick, oh, your ain't know"
15:28;15:31;"Asked my boy, no hint, he don't go"
15:31;15:33;"Pour in false, and a bottle 'bout four or five Benz"
15:33;15:35;"I got a tent, I crashed a Benz"
15:35;15:36;"I got the b**** in the back, gettin' bent"
15:36;15:38;"I saw that in the back of the crib in the tent"
15:38;15:40;"Huh, slap, huh, I got a four-pack"
15:40;15:42;"Huh, I had to fold the Mac"
15:42;15:44;"Droppin' the d*** off the track"
15:44;15:46;"Yeah, I moved them boys live"
15:46;15:47;"Free our money, two bank in the five"
15:47;15:49;"Jump in that water, and first I dive"
15:49;15:51;"I have such a good transition"
15:51;15:54;"From our Little Caesars to our Domino talk"
15:54;15:55;"Back to Dominoes"
15:55;15:57;"That in 1992"
15:57;16:00;"I mean this feels so TC"
16:00;16:04;"The owners of Little Caesars bought the Detroit Tigers"
16:04;16:05;"The baseball team"
16:05;16:08;"From the owner of Dominoes"
16:08;16:08;"Woah"
16:08;16:10;"That rules"
16:10;16:11;"Deep"
16:11;16:12;"And I think"
16:12;16:12;"There's still a-"
16:12;16:14;"Is Little Caesars Michigan based?"
16:14;16:17;"I'm pretty sure there's a Little Caesars arena in Detroit"
16:18;16:19;"Is that where the Pistons play?"
16:19;16:20;"Okay"
16:20;16:22;"So yeah, they're major out there"
16:22;16:25;"I think Little Caesars was founded in Detroit"
16:25;16:25;"And"
16:25;16:28;"They're still headquartered in Detroit"
16:28;16:29;"That's crazy that"
16:29;16:31;"Two huge"
16:31;16:32;"Pisa chains are coming out of Michigan"
16:32;16:34;"Shoutout to Michigan"
16:34;16:36;"Alright, so back to Dominoes"
16:36;16:36;"Like, so what's the story?"
16:36;16:38;"Why is it even called Dominoes?"
16:38;16:39;"It's funny, like the"
16:39;16:40;"All of these"
16:40;16:41;"The ones"
16:41;16:44;"All of like the really big chains"
16:44;16:47;"I guess kinda seem like they were built to be chains"
16:48;16:49;"Although I guess Papa John's"
16:49;16:51;"If you really take a step back"
16:51;16:52;"That kinda just sounds like a local dude"
16:52;16:54;"Like, ""Oh yeah, Papa John"""
16:54;16:55;"He's an older Italian man"
16:55;16:57;"He opened it in the 50s"
16:57;16:59;"It's family business"
16:59;17:00;"But like, Dominoes"
17:00;17:02;"Just sounds like"
17:02;17:04;"It has a little bit of that Einstein Brothers energy"
17:04;17:05;"Where you're kind of like"
17:05;17:07;"A bunch of people put their heads together and were like"
17:07;17:09;"""Guys, people love pizza"""
17:09;17:12;"""But you're never gonna go national with Antonio's or Vinnie's"""
17:12;17:14;"""Let's pull something"""
17:14;17:16;"""That feels fun"""
17:16;17:18;"""Maybe doesn't feel too Italian"""
17:18;17:20;"And like somebody's like, ""What about like Domino?"""
17:20;17:22;"A lot of different people like to play Dominoes"
17:22;17:24;"And you're like, ""Yeah, sure, it's a good symbol"""
17:24;17:25;"But does anybody have the actual story?"
17:25;17:29;"Yeah, it was originally called Dominick's Restaurant"
17:29;17:31;"Oh, okay"
17:31;17:31;"When it was purchased"
17:31;17:34;"And it seems like it was a little contentious"
17:34;17:35;"Because"
17:35;17:37;"When they expanded"
17:37;17:39;"They wanted to keep the same branding"
17:39;17:43;"But the original owner did not let them keep Dominick's"
17:43;17:43;"So they"
17:43;17:45;"An employee of the restaurant"
17:46;17:47;"Suggested Dominoes"
17:47;17:49;"That person probably did not get any royalties"
17:49;17:51;"But the people who took over from"
17:51;17:54;"Who took over Dominick's were Tom"
17:54;17:56;"Monaghan and his brother"
17:56;17:59;"And the little fun thing I'm reading here is that"
17:59;18:03;"One of the brothers didn't want to split the work evenly"
18:03;18:07;"Because he didn't want to quit his full-time postman job"
18:07;18:11;"So he wasn't his gung-ho"
18:11;18:11;"He wasn't gonna"
18:11;18:13;"He was dipping his toe in the water"
18:13;18:15;"But he was like, ""I'm not gonna quit my"""
18:15;18:17;"""I'm not gonna quit my postman job"""
18:17;18:20;"Wow, so Monaghan's an Irish name, right?"
18:20;18:21;"It sounds like a pub"
18:21;18:22;"Kind of"
18:22;18:24;"Is this a little bit of a reverse McDonald's?"
18:24;18:25;"Like"
18:25;18:27;"With two brothers"
18:27;18:29;"Purchasing someone's restaurant"
18:29;18:31;"Like instead of Ray Kroc"
18:31;18:32;"And keeping the name"
18:32;18:34;"Yeah, they actually changed the name"
18:34;18:36;"So this sounds also like a story where"
18:36;18:38;"The"
18:38;18:40;"People kind of just got lucky"
18:40;18:40;"Because"
18:40;18:42;"I'm picturing these two Irish brothers"
18:42;18:44;"Who are just like, ""Alright"""
18:44;18:47;"""We bought out this old Italian dude Dominic's"""
18:47;18:50;"""And now we're gonna be Dominic"""
18:50;18:52;"""Nobody would ever take us seriously"""
18:52;18:53;"""A couple Irish dudes"""
18:53;18:54;"""Selling pizza"""
18:54;18:56;"""But we have this amazing IP"""
18:56;18:57;"""Dominic"""
18:57;18:59;"Then Dominic's like, ""No, no, no, no"""
18:59;19:00;"""You can't have my IP"""
19:00;19:01;"""You can't call it Dominic's"""
19:01;19:02;"And they're just like, ""F***"""
19:02;19:04;"""We love the name"""
19:04;19:05;"""But then deep down"""
19:05;19:07;"""Can you imagine there being"""
19:07;19:09;"""America just having like, you know"""
19:09;19:13;"""25,000 pizza chains called Dominic's?"""
19:13;19:15;"It's like, the fact that it's called Domino's"
19:15;19:17;"Is what separates it from"
19:17;19:19;"The local Italian"
19:19;19:21;"Mom and pop spot"
19:21;19:24;"Just imagine that you're like, Dominic's family"
19:24;19:26;"And he probably sold it for a little bit of money"
19:26;19:27;"Like a tiny bit of money and then"
19:27;19:29;"They don't even keep his name"
19:29;19:30;"And it's just like"
19:30;19:31;"It's almost like insult to injury"
19:31;19:33;"That they're just like, ""Alright"""
19:33;19:34;"""Fine"""
19:34;19:36;"""What's a word that vaguely starts"""
19:36;19:37;"""Sounds like your-"""
19:37;19:38;"""It's just like, so random"""
19:38;19:38;"""Domino"""
19:38;19:40;"I think of the Van Morrison song"
19:40;19:41;"Oh yeah"
19:41;19:42;"Domino"
19:42;19:44;"Don't wanna discuss it"
19:44;19:48;"Think it's time for a change"
19:48;19:52;"You may get disgusted"
19:52;19:56;"Start thinking that I'm strange"
19:56;19:59;"It keeps on going underground"
19:59;20:03;"Get some heavy rest"
20:03;20:06;"Never have to worry"
20:06;20:09;"About what is worse"
20:09;20:10;"Or what is best"
20:10;20:11;"Do it"
20:11;20:12;"Oh, oh, oh"
20:12;20:13;"Domino"
20:13;20:15;"Alright"
20:15;20:17;"Romeo, my Romeo"
20:17;20:19;"There you go"
20:19;20:21;"Lord have mercy"
20:21;20:22;"I said"
20:22;20:23;"Oh, oh, oh"
20:23;20:24;"Domino"
20:24;20:28;"Romeo, my Romeo"
20:28;20:30;"There you go"
20:30;20:32;"Say it again"
20:32;20:33;"I said"
20:33;20:36;"Oh, oh, oh"
20:36;20:38;"Domino"
20:38;20:39;"Alright, so now"
20:39;20:40;"Two Irish brothers"
20:41;20:42;"Have this"
20:42;20:43;"Random name"
20:43;20:46;"Named Pizzeria Domino's"
20:46;20:48;"And I guess just little by little"
20:48;20:48;"They'd"
20:48;20:50;"Turn it into an empire"
20:50;20:50;"Yeah"
20:50;20:51;"It's interesting"
20:51;20:54;"Purchased by Bain Capital in '88"
20:54;20:54;"Again?"
20:54;20:55;"Bain Capital?"
20:55;20:57;"As you do, man"
20:57;20:58;"Always"
20:58;21:00;"The company logo originally had three dots"
21:00;21:03;"Representing the three original stores in 1965"
21:03;21:06;"Monaghan planned to add a new dot"
21:06;21:08;"With the addition of every new store"
21:09;21:10;"But this idea quickly faded"
21:10;21:12;"As Domino's experienced rapid growth"
21:12;21:13;"Okay"
21:13;21:16;"Like"
21:16;21:18;"17,000 dots?"
21:18;21:19;"It's just like"
21:19;21:20;"It's very abstract"
21:20;21:22;"What was their maximum"
21:22;21:23;"What was their goal gonna be?"
21:23;21:24;"Like they thought"
21:24;21:25;"Like, oh, we won't have more than"
21:25;21:26;"What?"
21:26;21:27;"Nine stores?"
21:27;21:28;"It's like the American flag"
21:28;21:29;"You didn't think it through"
21:29;21:31;"If they turn DC into a state"
21:31;21:32;"What are you gonna do?"
21:32;21:32;"You're gonna"
21:32;21:33;"Right"
21:33;21:36;"51 stars on the flag"
21:36;21:38;"I wonder if they ever went out to Van Morrison for"
21:39;21:41;"See if they could secure that song for an ad"
21:41;21:42;"Oh, it'd be perfect"
21:42;21:46;"I mean, if he like re-sang it in like 1991"
21:46;21:47;"And just said Domino's"
21:47;21:48;"Instead of"
21:48;21:49;"'Cause I think it's like"
21:49;21:50;"Domino"
21:50;21:51;"Yeah, it's singular"
21:51;21:51;"The song"
21:51;21:53;"But if he changed it to"
21:53;21:54;"Domino's"
21:54;21:57;"Yeah, I really have no idea where Domino falls"
21:57;21:58;"'Cause this says"
21:58;21:59;"In a 2009 survey of"
21:59;22:03;"Consumer taste preferences among national chains by brand keys"
22:03;22:04;"Domino's"
22:04;22:06;"Tied for last place"
22:07;22:08;"Along with Chuck E. Cheese"
22:08;22:10;"Now that's crazy"
22:10;22:11;"'Cause"
22:11;22:11;"Friend of the show"
22:11;22:13;"Chuck E. Cheese"
22:13;22:16;"I didn't think Domino's was like down there"
22:16;22:19;"Yeah, I think it has a pretty bad reputation"
22:19;22:22;"Wait, so is Papa John's considered classier than Domino's?"
22:22;22:23;"I think so"
22:23;22:24;"I mean"
22:24;22:24;"Really?"
22:24;22:26;"Before Papa John Schnatter"
22:26;22:28;"Like kind of trashes"
22:28;22:30;"His reputation within sort of like"
22:30;22:31;"Liberal circles"
22:31;22:35;"Like if you asked someone in like 2006"
22:36;22:37;"Of the major three chains"
22:37;22:39;"Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Domino's"
22:39;22:41;"Who has the best pizza?"
22:41;22:45;"I think you'd get a vast majority of people saying Papa John's"
22:45;22:48;"Now I don't think that's the case anymore 'cause"
22:48;22:50;"Politics now consumes everything"
22:50;22:51;"Right"
22:51;22:53;"I think Papa John's 'cause of the garlic sauce cup"
22:53;22:57;"And 'cause they were slightly like a newer brand"
22:57;22:57;"Okay"
22:57;22:59;"Had like a better reputation"
22:59;23:01;"15, 20 years ago"
23:01;23:03;"And Domino's is basically just considered trash?"
23:03;23:04;"Yeah, I think so"
23:04;23:07;"I think you have a weird perception of it"
23:07;23:10;"I mean, I never thought it was like great"
23:10;23:11;"But I thought it was like fine"
23:11;23:12;"Here's the thing"
23:12;23:15;"I mean, I worked for Domino's and I worked for Papa John's"
23:15;23:18;"And I've eaten Pizza Hut a fair amount in my life"
23:18;23:19;"And it's all the same stuff"
23:19;23:20;"It doesn't"
23:20;23:23;"You know, there's a few like slight variations"
23:23;23:25;"Like the garlic sauce cup or whatever"
23:25;23:25;"Yeah"
23:25;23:26;"But like"
23:26;23:28;"It's all coming from the same"
23:28;23:30;"You know, offsite sort of like"
23:30;23:32;"Right, Pizza Hut feels more like"
23:32;23:33;"Unique"
23:33;23:36;"It's that kind of strange deep dish"
23:36;23:38;"Almost like fried flavor"
23:38;23:41;"They put mayonnaise in the pan"
23:41;23:42;"At Pizza Hut?"
23:42;23:43;"And that's what gives it"
23:43;23:45;"That's what gives it its special crust"
23:45;23:46;"I don't buy that"
23:46;23:47;"It's true"
23:47;23:47;"I'm gonna look at it"
23:47;23:48;"I'm gonna number crunch this"
23:48;23:49;"But that's true"
23:49;23:50;"That's why the crust tastes different"
23:50;23:53;"Pizza Hut has that special mayonnaise crust"
23:53;23:56;"Wait, I think they probably put some sort of like"
23:56;23:58;"Margarine based like"
23:58;24:01;"Greasing product like in the pan"
24:01;24:02;"But I don't think it's mayonnaise"
24:03;24:05;"To give it that special fried cake feel"
24:05;24:09;"Does Pizza Hut have a significant delivery business"
24:09;24:11;"Or they were just always about eating, dining?"
24:11;24:13;"Oh no, Hut has serious delivery"
24:13;24:14;"Yeah, maybe it's just a"
24:14;24:17;"It's a quirk of the street I grew up on"
24:17;24:17;"Yeah"
24:17;24:19;"We didn't have Pizza Hut"
24:19;24:21;"Anywhere nearby and"
24:21;24:22;"Just couldn't get delivered"
24:22;24:24;"Okay, so sounds like"
24:24;24:28;"After that really abysmal survey in 2009"
24:28;24:31;"They announced plans to entirely reinvent pizza"
24:31;24:33;"Which included a self-critical ad campaign"
24:33;24:36;"In which consumers were filmed criticizing the pizza's quality"
24:36;24:38;"Chefs were then shown developing a new pizza"
24:38;24:41;"Then they hired J. Patrick Doyle as their new CEO"
24:41;24:45;"And experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain"
24:45;24:48;"Okay, so maybe the new Domino's has only been"
24:48;24:50;"Roughly the past 10 years"
24:50;24:51;"Then I've started hearing"
24:51;24:52;"Oh, people really"
24:52;24:54;"You know, Wall Street really likes Domino's stock"
24:54;24:57;"Because they're investing in all this new tech"
24:57;25:00;"That's actually something that Bayo has said to me over the years"
25:00;25:03;"That Domino's is considered almost a tech company"
25:03;25:06;"Because they put so much money into their software"
25:06;25:08;"And their delivery systems"
25:08;25:10;"And they're going to be building oven cars"
25:10;25:12;"And all sorts of crazy stuff"
25:12;25:12;"What?"
25:12;25:14;"Actually, I was just reading about this"
25:14;25:15;"Oven car?"
25:15;25:16;"Three weeks ago"
25:16;25:20;"So yeah, they had an oven car they released in 2015"
25:20;25:21;"That was like"
25:21;25:22;"It has a"
25:22;25:23;"Yeah, it has a built-in oven"
25:23;25:26;"But I don't think they rolled it out like super wide"
25:26;25:28;"But I was just reading that three weeks ago"
25:29;25:31;"Domino's launched an autonomous pizza delivery"
25:31;25:34;"Robot car in Houston"
25:34;25:37;"Customers can choose to have their meal delivered by an R2 robot"
25:37;25:41;"It's the first completely autonomous on-road delivery vehicle"
25:41;25:43;"Approved by the US Department of Transportation"
25:43;25:46;"All right, Domino's fortunes have really turned"
25:46;25:48;"But so this pizza car"
25:48;25:50;"It pulls up to your house or your apartment building"
25:50;25:51;"And then"
25:51;25:53;"You got to just walk outside and meet it?"
25:53;25:57;"There's a picture of a person walking to the car"
25:57;25:58;"And"
25:59;26:01;"There's like some sort of like hole in the car"
26:01;26:02;"Maybe it's a"
26:02;26:03;"Maybe you push"
26:03;26:04;"It's like RoboCop"
26:04;26:05;"Mr. Koenig"
26:05;26:09;"You ordered two large two topping"
26:09;26:11;"Pepperoni green pepper"
26:11;26:13;"Pepperoni black olive"
26:13;26:17;"It looks like you push a button and then the thing opens"
26:17;26:18;"And your pizza's inside"
26:18;26:19;"You take it out"
26:19;26:27;"No, this is too much, man"
26:28;26:29;"It's too intense"
26:29;26:30;"Too harsh"
26:30;26:32;"I want to just go to Antonio's, man"
26:32;26:34;"I just want to see a dude"
26:34;26:36;"Throwing that crust up into the air"
26:36;26:37;"Yep"
26:37;26:40;"Dollop some of that red sauce on with the ladle spread it around"
26:40;26:41;"Boom"
26:41;26:42;"Brutal"
26:42;26:45;"Have you guys used the Domino's app like"
26:45;26:45;"Ever?"
26:45;26:49;"No, but I imagine that must be part of their tech or something"
26:49;26:50;"Oh, yeah, well, when you"
26:50;26:51;"Yeah, when you talked about tech"
26:51;26:54;"I was like, oh, yeah, their app is pretty advanced"
26:54;26:57;"Like they really do keep you updated every step of the way"
26:57;27:01;"It's like there's a little loading bar and it's like making the throwing it up"
27:01;27:02;"Now it's in the oven"
27:02;27:05;"Like you can get like text notifications as well"
27:05;27:07;"Like you get really kept"
27:07;27:09;"Yeah, up to date with that app"
27:09;27:10;"That's so cool, dude"
27:10;27:13;"Like, oh, wow, my pizza's in the oven"
27:13;27:15;"That's so cool that I know that"
27:15;27:16;"Maybe there's something about that app"
27:16;27:19;"But we don't understand because we're not tech guys"
27:19;27:24;"There's something about like the how quickly the information moves"
27:24;27:27;"Or some algorithm that they crack that actually is like incredibly useful"
27:27;27:32;"And maybe they're selling that code or like some version of it to like all sorts of other"
27:32;27:33;"Yeah, maybe to the Pentagon"
27:33;27:38;"Domino's is licensing their code to the NSA"
27:38;27:41;"Who knows? Like maybe they're at some conference and"
27:41;27:47;"Yes, maybe like a hospital network finds that actually that tech is very valuable for their patients"
27:47;27:50;"I mean, I guess stuff like that happens"
27:50;27:53;"But yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a quote from the Domino's CEO a while back"
27:53;27:58;"That's like, man, pizza is like the last thing on my mind, we're a tech company"
27:58;28:02;"And I guess it's paying off"
28:02;28:04;"But just like"
28:04;28:06;"It's so funny"
28:06;28:10;"Pizza's the last thing on my mind"
28:10;28:18;"Just one day Domino's pizza tech is being used in like the drone war with China"
28:18;28:22;"And just like some sort of like guided missile system"
28:22;28:25;"One day people write that it has its roots in Domino's technology"
28:25;28:27;"You just think about Dominic"
28:27;28:32;"Just like, did this guy even, could he ever have guessed?"
28:32;28:37;"Dominic probably never even could have guessed that one day there'd be this weird"
28:37;28:41;"Chain called Domino's that just like dotted the whole world"
28:41;28:45;"And then just you go one step further and just like, oh, that's not all Dominic"
28:45;28:48;"It actually became a tech company"
28:48;28:50;"He just like, what's that?"
28:50;28:53;"This is like Dominic, this little"
28:53;28:57;"I wonder what Dominic's story was, was he an immigrant from Italy?"
28:57;29:01;"I'll tell you, first of all, like if we're thinking about like the economics of it"
29:01;29:06;"The deal was secured by a $500 down payment in 1960"
29:06;29:10;"And the company is now valued at $4.1 billion"
29:10;29:12;"Oh no, I hate that"
29:12;29:17;"Yeah, as far as who that was, his name was Dominic De Varty"
29:17;29:21;"And it's like one of those things"
29:21;29:26;"Yeah, I'm not seeing a lot of information about him, to be honest with you"
29:26;29:30;"His Wikipedia doesn't have like the blue like highlighting under his name"
29:30;29:32;"And Google isn't really"
29:32;29:36;"Hmm, Domino's is gunning to become the fourth"
29:36;29:40;"Because right now there's the big three of tech, Google, Apple and Facebook"
29:40;29:44;"Domino's is just almost there to turn into the big four"
29:44;29:47;"We got his obituary, by the way"
29:47;29:51;"He passed away in 2001, but he's from Jersey City"
29:51;29:52;"Aww"
29:52;29:55;"Born 1923, graduated from University of Michigan"
29:55;29:59;"Ran for mayor of Ann Arbor in 1957, but was defeated"
29:59;30:04;"And served in the Army Air Corps during World War II"
30:04;30:10;"Okay, so maybe it came full circle that his pizzeria started to create military technology"
30:10;30:16;"I hate to hear the story about the dude who sold something for 500 bucks and then it's worth billions"
30:16;30:18;"But when I do take a step back"
30:18;30:20;"It does kind of seem like"
30:20;30:24;"If you bought somebody's pizzeria and they don't even let you keep the name"
30:24;30:26;"What did you actually buy?"
30:26;30:28;"You bought like a building"
30:28;30:29;"He didn't invent pizza"
30:29;30:30;"You bought the oven"
30:30;30:31;"Yeah, you bought a building oven"
30:31;30:33;"You really were just buying the oven"
30:33;30:37;"And I guess if people hate Domino's so much, it's not even like you bought a secret recipe"
30:37;30:40;"This is almost like if somebody bought your old car"
30:40;30:43;"And then they made like a movie"
30:43;30:46;"Where they did a road trip with a car and the movie, you know, made"
30:46;30:47;"200 million dollars"
30:47;30:49;"I mean, what could you really say?"
30:49;30:50;"All right, yeah, you bought my car"
30:50;30:51;"You did your thing with it"
30:51;30:57;"I feel like if there is a McDonald's style, like a founder style movie about the Domino's story"
30:57;31:01;"There would be such an incredible scene about like the name issue"
31:01;31:05;"And like, like the sort of defiant like, oh, we don't even need your name, you know, like"
31:05;31:09;"I feel like it would be a real major plot point"
31:09;31:11;"You can't take my name"
31:11;31:14;"The Monaghan brothers put their heads together, they're like"
31:14;31:17;"You know what, Dominic, f*** you, we don't need your name"
31:17;31:19;"Domino's"
31:19;31:21;"Domino's"
31:21;31:24;"Oh, Domino's"
31:24;31:25;"All right, so"
31:25;31:28;"I mean, it is quite a story when you think about it"
31:28;31:30;"Domino's is a super random company"
31:30;31:32;"Not particularly beloved pizza"
31:32;31:34;"It's kind of just like"
31:34;31:35;"Get 'er done"
31:35;31:37;"I mean, it's almost like Pepsi in a sense"
31:37;31:40;"Although I don't think they have, they serve Pepsi at Domino's"
31:40;31:43;"But I just feel like Pepsi is"
31:43;31:46;"You sometimes get this impression that it's just their"
31:46;31:50;"It's just a hardworking company that carved out a niche for itself"
31:50;31:52;"It's not America's favorite"
31:52;31:54;"But it did its thing"
31:54;31:56;"And it's like, still here"
31:56;31:59;"And I guess that's true of Domino's too"
31:59;32:01;"On a dark street"
32:01;32:03;"On a cold night"
32:03;32:06;"Pizza's cooking in a storefront oven"
32:06;32:08;"On the corner"
32:08;32:10;"A boy is waiting"
32:10;32:14;"The moonlight feels cold and desperate"
32:14;32:18;"Some hidden sadness is bound down"
32:18;32:21;"Attention lives all over town"
32:21;32:25;"Ready to burst open into driving"
32:25;32:28;"Burning, exploding sound"
32:28;32:32;"If these walls could sing"
32:32;32:36;"They'd sing us a hundred songs"
32:36;32:39;"If these walls could talk"
32:40;32:44;"They'd say they'd seen it coming all along"
32:44;32:46;"But clearly"
32:46;32:48;"It sounds like in the 80s"
32:48;32:50;"Maybe after the Bain Capital purchase"
32:50;32:53;"Is when Domino's became kind of like this real powerhouse"
32:53;32:55;"Now we've laid the groundwork"
32:55;32:57;"We understand what Domino's is"
32:57;32:59;"Now we can talk about The Noid"
32:59;33:02;"The Noid is returning to Domino's advertising"
33:02;33:04;"To help promote its testing of driverless cars"
33:04;33:06;"Meant to streamline pizza delivery"
33:07;33:09;"Okay, this is what Kate Trumbull"
33:09;33:11;"Domino's Vice President of Advertising"
33:11;33:12;"Said in a statement"
33:12;33:16;"The Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain"
33:16;33:20;"How many villains does Domino's have?"
33:20;33:23;"She's talking about it like it's Greek mythology"
33:23;33:26;"Like, there's all these characters in the Domino's universe"
33:26;33:27;"And of course we have Mi-"
33:27;33:29;"Or it's like the Batman universe"
33:29;33:32;"Where they're basically saying like, you know, of course"
33:32;33:34;"You've got the Riddler and you've got Bain"
33:34;33:36;"But there's only one Joker"
33:36;33:38;"And he's coming back in the new movie"
33:38;33:42;"But anyway, the Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain"
33:42;33:43;"Name me one other villain"
33:43;33:46;"And the pizza delivery testing we're doing"
33:46;33:48;"With Neuro's autonomous vehicles"
33:48;33:50;"Is exactly the kind of technology and innovation"
33:50;33:52;"That could provoke the Noid to return"
33:52;33:55;"However, after 35 years of practice in avoiding the Noid"
33:55;33:57;"We're pretty confident we know how to defeat it"
33:57;33:58;"So, okay"
33:58;34:03;"The Noid was created in 1986 by Group 243"
34:03;34:06;"The advertising agency for Domino's Pizza"
34:06;34:08;"They made these commercials with this creature"
34:08;34:11;"He was like a humanoid dude wearing red"
34:11;34:13;"And the slogan was ""Avoid the Noid"""
34:13;34:17;"He was named after the employee's nickname of ""Dominoids"""
34:17;34:19;"In advertisements"
34:19;34:21;"The Noid would attempt to delay the delivery of pizzas"
34:21;34:24;"Who at the time guaranteed delivery in under 30 minutes"
34:24;34:25;"Where the pizza was free"
34:25;34:26;"So I guess that's also worth saying"
34:26;34:29;"A huge part of Domino's marketing"
34:29;34:31;"Was about the fact that it would get there quick"
34:31;34:34;"And I feel like back in the day there were always so many jokes about like"
34:34;34:36;"That would be like a common thing in like movies"
34:36;34:37;"Where like"
34:37;34:39;"Some kids would order pizza and just be like"
34:39;34:41;"""That was 31 minutes"""
34:41;34:43;"And the pizza guy's like ""Come on, man"""
34:43;34:45;"That really caught people's imagination"
34:45;34:47;"This idea of 30 minutes or less"
34:47;34:48;"So"
34:48;34:50;"I guess by creating a villain"
34:50;34:54;"They were getting people to really believe in the 30 minutes or less concept"
34:54;34:55;"And almost"
34:55;34:58;"Root for the person to get there in 30 minutes"
34:58;35:00;"It's almost like gambling a little bit"
35:00;35:02;"Where people probably felt like"
35:03;35:05;"Little Caesars taste way better but Domino's"
35:05;35:07;"I don't know, might get that free pizza"
35:07;35:08;"I just wonder like"
35:08;35:09;"How"
35:09;35:11;"Rigid those rules were"
35:11;35:12;"I mean they must have been like"
35:12;35:15;"They must have had very specific delivery areas"
35:15;35:16;"Cause 30 minutes is"
35:16;35:18;"Fast, I mean"
35:18;35:18;"Yeah"
35:18;35:21;"If you're slammed on like on a Friday night"
35:21;35:22;"That's not happening"
35:22;35:24;"Even if you're like around the corner"
35:24;35:25;"Well I guess that's why-"
35:25;35:25;"There must have been like"
35:25;35:28;"Intense stipulations with that"
35:28;35:30;"Well they probably had some kind of super computer already"
35:30;35:33;"To know exactly how many pizzas to have in the oven"
35:33;35:33;"To keep it"
35:33;35:35;"Coming quick"
35:35;35:37;"Yeah actually that raises a great question"
35:37;35:38;"Is like"
35:38;35:41;"How did that actually play out in practice?"
35:41;35:43;"You must have had so many tense situations where"
35:43;35:45;"There's just like a delivery person"
35:45;35:46;"By themselves"
35:46;35:48;"In some weird part of town"
35:48;35:49;"And they come to the door"
35:49;35:51;"And the person is just like"
35:51;35:52;"""34 minutes, dude"""
35:52;35:54;"Yeah just like some nut is like"
35:54;35:55;"""Ohhh"""
35:55;35:56;"""Nice try"""
35:56;35:58;"""You didn't make it in 30"""
35:58;35:59;"And the guy's like"
35:59;36:00;"""Well I have the receipt right here"""
36:00;36:01;"""I actually made it in uh"""
36:01;36:02;"""20"""
36:02;36:03;"And the guy's like"
36:03;36:04;"""No sir"""
36:04;36:05;"""No you didn't"""
36:05;36:06;"And the guy's like"
36:06;36:08;"""Umm I can't give you the pizza sir"""
36:08;36:09;"And he's like"
36:09;36:10;"Yanks it out of his hands"
36:10;36:11;"That must have happened so much"
36:11;36:12;"Well actually"
36:12;36:13;"So Jake"
36:13;36:14;"You did deliver for Domino's"
36:14;36:17;"Which hasn't been discussed much on the show"
36:17;36:18;"We've talked many times about your"
36:18;36:20;"Tenure with Papa John's"
36:20;36:21;"Were you"
36:21;36:23;"Engaging in any of this 30 minutes or less stuff?"
36:23;36:24;"No"
36:24;36:25;"I think this was"
36:25;36:28;"I wanna say this was the year 2000"
36:28;36:30;"And I think at that point"
36:30;36:32;"The 30 minutes or less was like"
36:32;36:33;"Ancient mythology"
36:33;36:35;"They eliminated it in the 90's"
36:35;36:38;"There'd been too much death and destruction?"
36:38;36:39;"Yeah"
36:39;36:40;"According to"
36:40;36:41;"It's an impossible standard"
36:41;36:42;"It was tearing the country apart"
36:42;36:44;"1993 lawsuit"
36:44;36:46;"Basically alleged that"
36:46;36:47;"Dom"
36:47;36:48;"This policy had"
36:48;36:51;"Caused over 20 fatalities in the 80's"
36:51;36:52;"What the hell?"
36:52;36:53;"Dozens of accidents"
36:53;36:56;"Oh just because the delivery people were so stressed"
36:56;36:57;"They're just driving like crazy?"
36:57;36:58;"Yeah"
36:58;37:00;"And then what ended the guarantee"
37:00;37:00;"Was that"
37:00;37:01;"In"
37:01;37:01;"Their"
37:01;37:02;"Uh"
37:02;37:02;"A"
37:02;37:03;"St. Louis woman"
37:03;37:07;"Sued Domino's and won a 78 million dollar verdict"
37:07;37:08;"Woah"
37:08;37:10;"She was hit in 1989"
37:10;37:12;"By a Domino's driver"
37:12;37:13;"Pfft"
37:13;37:13;"God"
37:13;37:14;"And was awarded"
37:14;37:16;"Almost 79 million dollars"
37:16;37:17;"Jeez"
37:17;37:19;"Just cause they were trying to get there in 30"
37:19;37:20;"Yeah"
37:20;37:20;"I also wonder"
37:20;37:22;"This is probably impossible to research"
37:22;37:23;"Maybe"
37:23;37:26;"If anybody's listening who delivered for Domino's"
37:26;37:27;"In the 30 minutes or less era"
37:27;37:29;"We'd love to hear your war stories"
37:29;37:30;"Please contact us"
37:30;37:33;"Cause I also just wonder how it worked"
37:33;37:35;"If the delivery people were so stressed"
37:35;37:36;"That they were just like"
37:36;37:38;"Driving like crazy to get there"
37:38;37:40;"Does that mean it like"
37:40;37:41;"Came out of their salary or something?"
37:41;37:43;"You think it was something harsh like that?"
37:43;37:43;"No way"
37:43;37:44;"No way"
37:44;37:45;"That's insane"
37:45;37:47;"It just goes to show like"
37:47;37:49;"If you put people in"
37:49;37:50;"Uh"
37:50;37:51;"A situation"
37:51;37:52;"They're like hamsters on a wheel"
37:52;37:53;"Mm"
37:53;37:55;"Why would the driver really care?"
37:55;37:58;"If it's like 35 minutes as opposed to 30"
37:58;37:59;"Maybe it affected their income somehow"
37:59;38:01;"Well they certainly wouldn't get a tip"
38:01;38:03;"They were not charged"
38:03;38:05;"The drivers would not be charged if they were late"
38:05;38:06;"So it really"
38:06;38:07;"That is interesting"
38:07;38:08;"I mean that kind of"
38:08;38:10;"Employer loyalty"
38:10;38:12;"Feels incredible"
38:12;38:14;"Yeah I'm sure like the manager was like"
38:14;38:14;"Go"
38:14;38:15;"Come on guys"
38:15;38:16;"Like the manager's getting"
38:16;38:17;"Heat from like the"
38:17;38:19;"Regional manager"
38:19;38:20;"What at the very-"
38:20;38:21;"And it's like we gotta get those delivery times down"
38:21;38:22;"Come on guys"
38:22;38:22;"And even-"
38:22;38:23;"Haul balls"
38:23;38:24;"And even if they"
38:24;38:26;"Time to haul balls"
38:26;38:28;"And even if the driver wasn't"
38:28;38:29;"Charged for the"
38:29;38:30;"The lost pizza"
38:30;38:32;"They might still"
38:32;38:32;"Have a"
38:32;38:34;"Nervousness about losing their job"
38:34;38:36;"If they were late too often"
38:36;38:37;"Yeah"
38:37;38:38;"I also wonder like"
38:38;38:40;"How often would you be leaving Domino's"
38:40;38:42;"With one delivery for one address?"
38:42;38:43;"Often?"
38:43;38:44;"Or you're always trying to get like"
38:44;38:45;"Two or three?"
38:45;38:46;"I mean"
38:46;38:48;"Maybe like half the time"
38:48;38:50;"It'd be like one address"
38:50;38:51;"And then during busy"
38:51;38:53;"Like rushes you'd have like"
38:53;38:53;"I don't know"
38:53;38:55;"Two or three or four"
38:55;38:57;"So just imagine without a phone"
38:57;38:58;"No maps"
38:58;38:59;"Or anything like that"
38:59;39:01;"Your local driver"
39:01;39:03;"You probably know the area pretty well"
39:03;39:05;"But still you'd occasionally be like"
39:05;39:06;"Um"
39:06;39:07;"This one's on"
39:07;39:10;"19 East Hamilton Way"
39:10;39:11;"And you're like"
39:11;39:12;"Uh I think"
39:12;39:13;"I think I know where that is"
39:13;39:15;"And you like have to get out like the big map"
39:15;39:17;"And like look up the name of the street"
39:17;39:18;"In the appendix"
39:18;39:20;"And then imagine you're trying to figure out"
39:20;39:21;"How to do-"
39:21;39:21;"They're like"
39:21;39:22;"These two are close together"
39:22;39:24;"And you're like in the car trying to figure out"
39:24;39:25;"Which one to go to first"
39:25;39:26;"Seems incredibly stressful"
39:26;39:27;"And difficult"
39:27;39:29;"So"
39:29;39:33;"I guess by imposing this insane standard"
39:33;39:35;"It probably did create a corporate culture"
39:35;39:37;"Where they knew they needed to invest in tech"
39:37;39:40;"They saw the fallibility of humans"
39:40;39:43;"There is something also very militaristic about the"
39:43;39:45;"Imposing"
39:45;39:47;"Imposing this like ticking clock"
39:47;39:49;"On the food delivery"
39:49;39:51;"Just like Mark Wahlberg"
39:51;39:53;"Racing through the streets of"
39:53;39:54;"Kabul"
39:54;39:54;"Like"
39:54;39:55;"We're on a mission"
39:55;39:56;"We only have this amount of time"
39:56;39:57;"Yeah maybe after that lawsuit"
39:57;39:58;"They just kind of felt like"
39:58;40:01;"There was a feeling within the company that's like"
40:01;40:03;"One day we will transcend"
40:03;40:05;"The inefficiencies of flesh and blood"
40:05;40:06;"I remember like"
40:06;40:08;"At Papa John's like"
40:08;40:09;"I just remember like"
40:09;40:10;"When we'd leave for delivery"
40:10;40:12;"You'd have to like call out like"
40:12;40:14;"What the time on"
40:14;40:17;"Like how long the order had been in for"
40:17;40:18;"So you'd be like"
40:18;40:18;"Driver out"
40:18;40:19;"22 minutes"
40:19;40:21;"Wait you would just yell it in the store?"
40:21;40:22;"Yeah it was just like a"
40:22;40:24;"You know I mean there might be like"
40:24;40:25;"Some carry out orders"
40:25;40:25;"But like"
40:25;40:27;"You know you'd like yell it in the direction of like"
40:27;40:28;"The store manager"
40:28;40:30;"Driver out"
40:30;40:31;"22 minutes"
40:31;40:32;"Did you get into it?"
40:32;40:33;"I mean I would do it"
40:33;40:34;"No but I'm like"
40:34;40:35;"Would you actually be like"
40:35;40:36;"Driver out"
40:36;40:36;"Like get"
40:36;40:37;"Or you would just always be kind of like"
40:37;40:38;"Uh"
40:38;40:39;"Driver out"
40:39;40:40;"Uh"
40:40;40:43;"Probably"
40:43;40:44;"More of the latter"
40:44;40:46;"Driver out man"
40:46;40:47;"Uh"
40:47;40:48;"20 minutes"
40:48;40:49;"Ball games in the refrigerator"
40:49;40:51;"Doors closed"
40:51;40:52;"Lights are out"
40:52;40:54;"But it's getting hot"
40:54;40:55;"What is pizza pie?"
40:55;40:56;"Pizza pizza pie"
40:56;40:58;"Every minute every second"
40:58;40:59;"Pie pie pie pie pie"
40:59;41:00;"I order from the pie"
41:00;41:01;"Pizza pizza pie"
41:01;41:02;"Every minute every second"
41:02;41:03;"Pie pie pie pie pie"
41:03;41:04;"Pepperoni"
41:04;41:05;"Angry peppers"
41:05;41:05;"Mushrooms"
41:05;41:06;"Olive chive"
41:06;41:07;"Pepperoni"
41:07;41:08;"Angry peppers"
41:08;41:08;"Mushrooms"
41:08;41:08;"Olive chive"
41:08;41:09;"Me"
41:09;41:09;"Therapy"
41:09;41:10;"Therapy"
41:10;41:11;"Advertising causes"
41:11;41:11;"Me"
41:11;41:12;"Therapy"
41:12;41:13;"Advertising causes"
41:13;41:14;"Me"
41:14;41:14;"Therapy"
41:15;41:16;"Advertising causes"
41:16;41:17;"Therapy"
41:17;41:18;"Therapy"
41:18;41:19;"Advertising causes"
41:19;41:20;"The military thing"
41:20;41:21;"Really like looms large for me"
41:21;41:22;"Because like the"
41:23;41:24;"It's kind of video gamey"
41:24;41:25;"Just like to have a"
41:25;41:28;"To have like this intense objective"
41:28;41:29;"But also to have like a ticking clock"
41:29;41:31;"I'm wondering like how many"
41:31;41:33;"Just kind of minimum wage civilian jobs"
41:33;41:36;"Gave people that rush back then"
41:36;41:38;"You gotta get from point A to point B"
41:38;41:40;"Well now it'd be like Uber and"
41:40;41:42;"They'd get in so much trouble"
41:42;41:43;"If they started having like ticking clocks"
41:43;41:46;"Just imagine that if it was like"
41:46;41:49;"You got picked up at JFK at 6pm"
41:49;41:51;"If your driver"
41:51;41:52;"Can get you"
41:52;41:53;"To Times Square"
41:53;41:55;"In under 40 minutes"
41:55;41:57;"Uber will give them a bonus"
41:57;41:59;"Of $300"
41:59;42:01;"No it's so dangerous"
42:01;42:02;"Yeah"
42:02;42:04;"That's dark"
42:04;42:07;"In 2014"
42:07;42:09;"A McDonald's in South Florida"
42:09;42:10;"Did a promotion"
42:10;42:12;"That your drive-thru order"
42:12;42:14;"Will be ready in 60 seconds or less"
42:14;42:17;"If not you get a free lunch"
42:17;42:18;"Whoa"
42:18;42:20;"So just a single franchise did that?"
42:20;42:21;"It looks like"
42:22;42:24;"A handful of locations in South Florida did it"
42:24;42:25;"Hmm"
42:25;42:25;"Whoa"
42:25;42:27;"I wonder if they cleared that with corporate"
42:27;42:29;"I mean that seems"
42:29;42:31;"Really going off book there"
42:31;42:35;"I mean any of that loss comes out of his pocket"
42:35;42:36;"Or her pocket"
42:36;42:38;"Well that also raises the question"
42:38;42:39;"Is there a Rogue Domino's anywhere"
42:39;42:42;"That still does the 30 minutes or less thing?"
42:42;42:45;"Yeah if you're in like a tiny town"
42:45;42:45;"Right"
42:45;42:47;"I was just thinking about this"
42:47;42:49;"You know you're talking about it being militaristic"
42:49;42:50;"And thinking about Jake and"
42:51;42:53;"You know 16 year old Jake and his fatigues"
42:53;42:54;"And just the idea that if"
42:54;42:57;"Maybe it would be cool if Domino's dressed all of their"
42:57;42:59;"Drivers in fatigues"
42:59;43:02;"And like when you just saw your pizza get run up to the door"
43:02;43:04;"I don't know it's sort of"
43:04;43:05;"I think it would be nice"
43:05;43:05;"Sir yes sir"
43:05;43:06;"Mr. Koenig"
43:06;43:08;"You ordered two large two topping"
43:08;43:10;"Go go go go go go"
43:10;43:10;"Fallout"
43:10;43:13;"Actually"
43:13;43:16;"I think maybe we just cracked a code for a new business idea"
43:16;43:18;"Military pizza"
43:18;43:19;"Is that the name of it?"
43:19;43:20;"Military pizza?"
43:20;43:22;"I mean we could probably come up with something better"
43:22;43:22;"Better name"
43:22;43:24;"Working title"
43:24;43:26;"Maybe we could hire veterans"
43:26;43:27;"Although maybe that's actually"
43:27;43:28;"Messed up"
43:28;43:30;"To make veterans reenact"
43:30;43:32;"Military procedures"
43:32;43:34;"So maybe it is we just hire just like randos"
43:34;43:37;"We hire just like the rando people who like"
43:37;43:39;"Are like obsessed with the military but"
43:39;43:42;"Never had the courage to enlist"
43:42;43:44;"And they get to dress in military fatigues"
43:44;43:46;"They get to have like the face paint"
43:46;43:49;"They get to work in teams too"
43:50;43:52;"Of course they deliver it in jeeps"
43:52;43:53;"The boxes are"
43:53;43:54;"Green"
43:54;43:55;"And"
43:55;43:57;"We guarantee it"
43:57;43:59;"10 minutes or less"
43:59;44:02;"Yeah it's not an eco-friendly chain"
44:02;44:03;"It is"
44:03;44:06;"They consume an enormous amount of resources"
44:06;44:08;"Making the pizza extremely fast"
44:08;44:10;"And getting to you extremely fast"
44:10;44:11;"Guys"
44:11;44:12;"And you know"
44:12;44:13;"They don't care about"
44:13;44:15;"If there's collateral damage"
44:15;44:16;"I mean if they like"
44:16;44:17;"Have to run a red light"
44:17;44:19;"They'll do it"
44:19;44:19;"Using"
44:19;44:20;"There's a lot of"
44:20;44:22;"Lot of usage of smoke bombs"
44:22;44:27;"Guys this is terrible"
44:27;44:30;"Domino's is still doing the 30 minute policy in India"
44:30;44:32;"Oh my god"
44:32;44:34;"Of course they are"
44:34;44:35;"Of course!"
44:35;44:37;"Indian cities infamously having"
44:37;44:38;"Terrible traffic"
44:38;44:39;"Right"
44:39;44:39;"Can you imagine"
44:39;44:43;"Some like rich dude from like the upper castes of India"
44:43;44:44;"Quartering"
44:44;44:46;"Domino's"
44:46;44:46;"Wow"
44:46;44:47;"That's so"
44:47;44:48;"Wow"
44:48;44:49;"That's so heavy"
44:49;44:51;"This is on their website"
44:51;44:53;"Our massive team of store staff"
44:53;44:55;"Starts timing the order as soon as they get off the phone"
44:55;44:58;"And then they go into a very specific"
44:58;45:00;"Explanation of how many minutes"
45:00;45:02;"Each step in the process comes"
45:02;45:03;"And then they say"
45:03;45:04;"Next comes the delivery itself"
45:04;45:06;"That never takes more than 8 minutes"
45:06;45:07;"Never?"
45:07;45:07;"What?"
45:07;45:07;"Okay well that"
45:07;45:08;"I mean"
45:08;45:10;"You have to have very specific"
45:10;45:11;"Hemmed in"
45:11;45:13;"Tight delivery areas"
45:13;45:15;"So maybe there's just an abundance of Domino's"
45:15;45:16;"And it's just seriously"
45:16;45:16;"Hold on"
45:17;45:17;"Guys"
45:17;45:18;"Guys"
45:18;45:18;"I"
45:18;45:19;"This is insane"
45:19;45:22;"The Domino's founder"
45:22;45:23;"This is from Bon Appetit magazine"
45:23;45:24;"Yeah"
45:24;45:25;"2011"
45:25;45:29;"The Domino's founder opens a military themed burger joint"
45:29;45:31;"With camo wearing delivery guys"
45:31;45:31;"What?"
45:31;45:32;"Oh my god"
45:32;45:33;"Whoa"
45:33;45:34;"We are tapped into this"
45:34;45:35;"Where was this?"
45:35;45:36;"I didn't even read the article"
45:36;45:37;"I just saw the title"
45:37;45:38;"And I called you"
45:38;45:38;"Alright"
45:38;45:39;"The founder being"
45:39;45:40;"This is creep"
45:40;45:40;"Monaghan?"
45:40;45:41;"Tom Monaghan"
45:41;45:43;"Founder of Domino's"
45:43;45:44;"It's called Punisher Burgers"
45:44;45:45;"By the way"
45:46;45:49;"Famous Catholic cause philanthropist"
45:49;45:51;"Has decided to get back into the delivery food business"
45:51;45:52;"With a military themed burger joint"
45:52;45:53;"Called"
45:53;45:54;"Green"
45:54;45:56;"G-Y-R-E-N-E"
45:56;45:57;"Green Burger"
45:57;45:57;"Wait wait"
45:57;45:58;"It's main selling point is"
45:58;45:59;"T-T-R"
45:59;46:02;"G-Y-R-E-N-E"
46:02;46:02;"Green?"
46:02;46:03;"G-Y-R-E-N-E"
46:03;46:03;"What the hell?"
46:03;46:06;"Just spell it green"
46:06;46:08;"It's main selling point"
46:08;46:09;"Is the way they deliver the burgers"
46:09;46:11;"Employees wearing military camo"
46:11;46:13;"Ring your doorbell"
46:13;46:14;"Call you sir and ma'am"
46:14;46:14;"What?"
46:14;46:15;"This is insane"
46:15;46:15;"This is"
46:15;46:16;"I know this is"
46:16;46:17;"This is not real"
46:17;46:20;"Salute after handing off the sack of food"
46:20;46:21;"Mr. Koding"
46:21;46:22;"Sir yes sir"
46:22;46:24;"And then they run back to their car"
46:24;46:26;"They salute you?"
46:26;46:26;"Yes"
46:26;46:28;"The delivery people will be called"
46:28;46:30;"Green Joggers"
46:30;46:32;"G-Y-R-E-N-E"
46:32;46:34;"And their bosses will be called captains"
46:34;46:35;"Instead of just managers"
46:35;46:37;"For the curious or confused"
46:37;46:39;"Green is a nickname for a marine"
46:39;46:40;"A World War 2 mashup of GI"
46:40;46:43;"Itself short for"
46:43;46:45;"Galvanized Iron and Marine"
46:45;46:49;"Monaghan accidentally joined the Marines in 1956"
46:49;46:50;"Intending to sign up with the army"
46:50;46:53;"And he stayed there for a three year tour"
46:53;46:54;"I mean that's honestly"
46:54;46:55;"So that"
46:55;46:56;"That's insane"
46:56;46:57;"That chain didn't"
46:57;46:57;"Wait did it happen?"
46:57;46:59;"Didn't exactly thrive"
46:59;46:59;"It didn't"
46:59;47:01;"But that it's the dominoes guy"
47:01;47:02;"Like the fact that you are"
47:02;47:03;"Yeah it went by"
47:03;47:04;"Wait so they didn't even open one?"
47:04;47:05;"They opened one"
47:05;47:06;"Where was it?"
47:06;47:07;"Where?"
47:07;47:09;"Monaghan told the national restaurant news"
47:09;47:10;"That he was not sure"
47:10;47:12;"I like this"
47:12;47:13;"I do like"
47:13;47:14;"He's like I'm not"
47:14;47:15;"Quote"
47:15;47:17;"I'm not sure if the concept will work"
47:17;47:19;"But it's being put into test"
47:19;47:20;"In two pilot locations"
47:20;47:21;"In southwest Florida"
47:21;47:23;"So I guess then maybe another one in"
47:23;47:24;"Tennessee"
47:24;47:25;"It didn't work"
47:25;47:25;"But don't"
47:25;47:26;"The fact that"
47:26;47:28;"You could feel"
47:28;47:30;"The sort of militaristic"
47:30;47:31;"Kind of organi-"
47:31;47:31;"Whoa"
47:31;47:34;"That you could feel that in dominoes"
47:34;47:36;"This is going way deeper than I thought it would"
47:36;47:39;"I thought the dominoes becoming a tech company thing is funny"
47:39;47:40;"But like"
47:41;47:43;"I think we're barely scratching the surface here"
47:43;47:44;"Okay we're gonna"
47:44;47:46;"Hopefully there's a good book on dominoes"
47:46;47:48;"I feel like that concept could have legs"
47:48;47:52;"I feel like burgers are the wrong food for a delivery service"
47:52;47:54;"Because like fries are terrible"
47:54;47:57;"Five minutes after they're made"
47:57;47:57;"Yeah"
47:57;47:57;"Burgers"
47:57;47:58;"Burgers"
47:58;48:00;"You want to eat a burger that's"
48:00;48:00;"Sloppy and move around"
48:00;48:02;"40 minutes old"
48:02;48:02;"Like"
48:02;48:03;"But I feel like there is"
48:03;48:08;"A place in American culture for a militaristic food delivery"
48:08;48:09;"Absolutely"
48:09;48:10;"Maybe it's pizza"
48:10;48:11;"Maybe it's like"
48:11;48:13;"What else is good food?"
48:13;48:15;"Shouldn't it be like rations?"
48:15;48:16;"Like survival food?"
48:16;48:18;"Like cans of like"
48:18;48:20;"Just to stay on theme"
48:20;48:22;"Well that would make sense"
48:22;48:23;"But still people"
48:23;48:25;"That's not a good thing"
48:25;48:28;"Because the mission is that you have to get there quickly"
48:28;48:29;"Because this is hot food"
48:29;48:31;"It needs to be piping hot"
48:31;48:32;"Sure"
48:32;48:34;"Coffee?"
48:34;48:36;"I mean pizza really is like the archetypal"
48:36;48:37;"True"
48:37;48:39;"Apex"
48:40;48:41;"Food for delivery I think"
48:41;48:42;"Yeah"
48:42;48:43;"Military pizza"
48:43;48:45;"I actually I'm coming back to that name"
48:45;48:46;"I think there's something about it"
48:46;48:48;"Just military"
48:48;48:49;"Military pizza"
48:49;48:50;"Or you know"
48:50;48:51;"USSS pie"
48:51;48:52;"No"
48:52;48:56;"Oh you know what could be cool?"
48:56;48:59;"We could also like split it up to all branches of the armed forces"
48:59;49:00;"And have some healthy rivalries in town"
49:00;49:01;"Oh yeah"
49:01;49:02;"Where all right"
49:02;49:04;"Jake's working late at the studio"
49:04;49:05;"He wants a pie"
49:05;49:08;"He opens the military pizza app"
49:08;49:09;"And the first thing they ask him is"
49:10;49:12;"Which branch of the military do you want to order from?"
49:12;49:16;"Yeah wait or do I want to order from Colonel Pepperoni?"
49:16;49:20;"Or Admiral Olive"
49:20;49:23;"You could start a reserves program"
49:23;49:25;"One weekend a month"
49:25;49:25;"Two weeks a year"
49:25;49:28;"Just to do a little bit of delivery on the side"
49:28;49:31;"But also maybe there's another version too that's like"
49:31;49:33;"I mean this definitely would not play well"
49:33;49:37;"But the idea of it not being American military"
49:37;49:38;"Maybe it's like Italian"
49:39;49:39;"You know they have that"
49:39;49:42;"In Italy I've never fully understood it"
49:42;49:44;"But there's two different"
49:44;49:46;"I'm sure an Italian person would be like"
49:46;49:47;"No you totally have it wrong"
49:47;49:49;"But my understanding is that there's these two"
49:49;49:53;"Similar type police organizations"
49:53;49:56;"There's the police and then there's the carabinieri"
49:56;50:00;"I think the carabinieri is like a little bit in between the military and the police"
50:00;50:03;"But they both are present in many towns and cities"
50:03;50:05;"So it's a little bit unclear to me"
50:05;50:09;"What their relationship is and what the difference is"
50:09;50:13;"But yeah maybe we could do kind of like an Italian themed military"
50:13;50:15;"Colonel Pepperoni"
50:15;50:20;"Do you know that there's this chain"
50:20;50:20;"Where did I see it?"
50:20;50:22;"I feel like it's out west a little bit"
50:22;50:24;"Like in Colorado and stuff"
50:24;50:26;"Called Magic Mushroom Pizza"
50:26;50:27;"Oh yeah"
50:27;50:29;"Small chain"
50:29;50:32;"Seinfeld give me a little info on Magic Mushroom"
50:32;50:34;"Just because I feel like this is like the polar opposite"
50:34;50:37;"Okay so yeah Magic Mushroom Pizza"
50:37;50:39;"Oh no I'm thinking is it Mellow Mushroom?"
50:39;50:42;"Okay yeah there is a Mellow Mushroom as well"
50:42;50:43;"Oh it's from Atlanta"
50:43;50:46;"Ivy and then many a Mellow Mushroom"
50:46;50:48;"Oh yeah because you used to live in Georgia"
50:48;50:51;"Ah that's where I first saw Mellow Mushroom"
50:51;50:51;"And I had it when I was in Atlanta"
50:51;50:53;"That'd be a good band name too"
50:53;50:55;"I saw Mellow Mushroom"
50:55;50:57;"That'd be a great band name"
50:57;50:59;"Yeah and you could just use their logo"
50:59;51:00;"Oh hell yeah"
51:00;51:04;"This anthropomorphic yellow mushroom eating some pizza"
51:04;51:05;"And he's got kind of like a wink"
51:05;51:06;"You know a sly grin"
51:07;51:09;"There's 150 Mellow Mushrooms"
51:09;51:11;"So that's decent"
51:11;51:12;"That's pretty big"
51:12;51:13;"That's huge"
51:13;51:14;"150 wow"
51:14;51:16;"That's awesome"
51:16;51:18;"Mellow Mushroom"
51:18;51:19;"Takes as long as it takes man"
51:19;51:21;"The average delivery trip"
51:21;51:24;"Depending on how much you order"
51:24;51:27;"It could take as long as 8 to 10 hours"
51:27;51:28;"Hold tight buddy"
51:28;51:31;"I mean if you're in a hurry and looking for efficiency"
51:31;51:33;"Then order from Colonel Pepperoni"
51:33;51:34;"Be my guest"
51:35;51:41;"It's gonna be you know very industrialized and efficient"
51:41;51:46;"But I mean it's not gonna satiate any sort of spiritual need"
51:46;51:49;"Mellow Mushroom pizza takes time"
51:49;51:50;"You gotta ride it out"
51:50;51:51;"You gotta be open-minded"
51:51;51:54;"There's also DMT Vape Pizza"
51:54;51:56;"Takes 15 minutes"
51:56;51:57;"If you're really in a hurry"
51:57;52:02;"And dude it would be like the CEOs of Colonel Pepperoni and Mellow Mushroom"
52:02;52:04;"Like both used to work at the other company"
52:05;52:05;"Yeah"
52:05;52:08;"Like the CEO of Colonel Pepperoni started at Mellow Mushroom"
52:08;52:09;"And was like"
52:09;52:10;"Was just like"
52:10;52:11;"Sold out man"
52:11;52:12;"I started working there in '78"
52:12;52:13;"And you know what?"
52:13;52:14;"I was like"
52:14;52:16;"I've been falling to dead for a few years"
52:16;52:17;"And it seemed like a good fit"
52:17;52:18;"But you know what?"
52:18;52:19;"During the Reagan years"
52:19;52:21;"I started to have a change of heart about things"
52:21;52:25;"And I started to see all the things that I thought were virtues of Mellow Mushroom"
52:25;52:27;"As real liabilities"
52:27;52:33;"And then like the guy that runs Mellow Mushroom was like"
52:33;52:35;"Yeah I was real high strung as a young man"
52:35;52:41;"I mean I had enlisted and things didn't go the way I thought they might in boot camp"
52:41;52:44;"And I had to like just fully abort from that situation"
52:44;52:46;"And then I went AWOL"
52:46;52:48;"Mellow"
53:00;53:27;"- I like the idea that Colonel Pepperoni,"
53:27;53:29;"it sounds like, you know,"
53:29;53:31;"it sounds like a McDonald's character."
53:31;53:32;"Like, what's his name?"
53:32;53:33;"Mayor Cheeseburger?"
53:33;53:35;"- Mayor McCheese?"
53:35;53:38;"- Mayor McCheese, just like a big cutesy childish thing."
53:38;53:41;"But I like the idea that our Colonel Pepperoni,"
53:41;53:44;"his backstory is just like way darker."
53:44;53:46;"You picture it'd be like a big pepperoni"
53:46;53:47;"with a smiley face or something."
53:47;53:50;"It's like, no, Colonel Pepperoni is a man."
53:50;53:51;"- Oh yeah."
53:51;53:53;"- He's a man, he's played by-"
53:53;53:54;"- Josh Brolin."
53:54;53:55;"- Yeah, something like that."
53:55;53:58;"- I was gonna say like, what's that guy's name?"
53:58;53:59;"Mads Mikkelsen?"
53:59;54:00;"Mads Mikkelsen?"
54:00;54:01;"- Oh, that's a good one too."
54:01;54:03;"(laughing)"
54:03;54:04;"Mads Mikkelsen."
54:04;54:06;"(laughing)"
54:06;54:08;"- He's played by Michael Shannon."
54:08;54:11;"And it's just like-"
54:11;54:12;"- Russell Crowe."
54:12;54:14;"- It's just like these really intense pictures of him."
54:14;54:18;"And he has like a very realistic military outfit."
54:18;54:20;"And his backstory is just like,"
54:20;54:22;"is actually like really dark."
54:22;54:23;"- It's like Frank Castle, man."
54:23;54:24;"It's like no joke."
54:24;54:25;"- Yeah."
54:25;54:29;"- The mission-based job is kind of like interesting."
54:29;54:31;"It should pay well."
54:31;54:34;"And it shouldn't put people at risk, but-"
54:34;54:36;"- Thank you for calling Colonel Pepperoni's."
54:36;54:37;"This is Jake, how may I help you?"
54:37;54:39;"- Also, what about like,"
54:39;54:41;"this is back to some kind of Punisher Burger shit,"
54:41;54:43;"but what if Colonel Pepperoni was also like,"
54:43;54:45;"was literally one person?"
54:45;54:46;"It was kind of like Captain America."
54:46;54:48;"It's only one person at a time."
54:48;54:50;"And, you know, this would be an interesting way"
54:50;54:52;"to actually, I feel like at this point,"
54:52;54:56;"pop-up restaurants are so like mid 2000s."
54:56;54:57;"- Right."
54:57;54:57;"- I'm sure people still like them,"
54:57;54:59;"but you know, the novelty of like,"
54:59;55:01;"oh my God, there's this cute little pop-up place."
55:01;55:02;"It's only there for a little bit."
55:02;55:04;"Or food trucks or stuff."
55:04;55:05;"Obviously that stuff still exists,"
55:05;55:06;"but I feel like the real excitement"
55:06;55:10;"about these like temporary special pop-ups"
55:10;55:14;"and food trucks kind of peaked maybe about 10 years ago."
55:14;55:15;"But-"
55:15;55:16;"- Interesting."
55:16;55:17;"- I think what they're missing,"
55:17;55:19;"what would really make one stand out from the pack now"
55:19;55:21;"is something kind of narrative."
55:21;55:25;"So if there was a story about this kind of mysterious"
55:25;55:28;"ex-military dude who made incredible pizza"
55:28;55:31;"and you would just kind of like get these like,"
55:31;55:35;"like a weird flyer or somebody just like posts on like-"
55:35;55:39;"- Yeah, just like weird punk flyer on like a telephone pole."
55:39;55:42;"- Like a mysterious kind of QAnon type post"
55:42;55:44;"on 8chan or something."
55:44;55:46;"And it's just basically like,"
55:46;55:48;"I don't know, this information is totally unverified,"
55:48;55:52;"but it sounds like Colonel Pepperoni"
55:52;55:55;"is coming to Tacoma in November."
55:55;55:57;"And there's just like this buzz in the city"
55:57;55:58;"and people are like, ""What the (beep)?"""
55:58;55:59;"And be like, ""The only way to do it"
55:59;56:01;"is to download the Colonel Pepperoni app."""
56:01;56:05;"And like, it is something like everybody puts in the orders,"
56:05;56:07;"each pizza costs $300."
56:07;56:09;"And then you don't know if it's gonna come"
56:09;56:11;"and everybody's waiting."
56:11;56:12;"You invite your friends over and you're like,"
56:12;56:13;"""Holy (beep) holy (beep)"
56:13;56:15;"are we gonna get a Colonel Pepperoni pizza?"""
56:15;56:17;"And then you get like this buzz"
56:17;56:21;"that's just like a very ominous countdown, 10."
56:21;56:23;"It's like starts at 10 minutes, 10, nine."
56:23;56:25;"And then just like this weird ass dude comes,"
56:25;56:28;"the pizza's in like a black box."
56:28;56:29;"- I- - Almost like some"
56:29;56:30;"Nick Falz (beep)"
56:30;56:31;"- Yeah, I was thinking like,"
56:31;56:35;"what is Colonel Pepperoni's sort of online"
56:35;56:37;"sort of Twitter brand, you know, voice?"
56:37;56:40;"But maybe it is just like going to visit some,"
56:40;56:42;"you know, ex-Marine buddies in Tacoma."
56:42;56:44;"And then they're like,"
56:44;56:47;"""Oh (beep) Colonel Pepperoni's gonna be here."""
56:47;56:48;"In town."
56:48;56:49;"- Yep."
56:49;56:50;"- So he's sort of just like a dude."
56:50;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:52;"- You know, like, ""My mom's sick."
56:52;56:55;"I gotta head up to Seattle, Washington."""
56:55;56:56;"- Right."
56:56;56:57;"Well, yeah, you know what?"
56:57;56:59;"We're taking the Frank Castle Punisher burgers"
56:59;57:00;"to the next level,"
57:00;57:03;"where it's not merely this backstory,"
57:03;57:04;"it's an ongoing story."
57:04;57:05;"Where it's like,"
57:05;57:08;"""Why is Colonel Pepperoni in Tacoma?"""
57:08;57:10;"- You know, like taking like Liam Neeson,"
57:10;57:12;"like he has like- - Great film."
57:12;57:13;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:13;57:14;"And he's like a lone wolf,"
57:14;57:17;"but like when it comes time to like get some help,"
57:17;57:19;"he's got like his old crew of like-"
57:19;57:20;"- Yes."
57:20;57:21;"- Military special ops guys."
57:21;57:23;"So I feel like there's kind of like,"
57:23;57:25;"maybe there's a bit of an outfit like that"
57:25;57:26;"with Colonel Pepperoni."
57:26;57:27;"- Oh, I love that."
57:27;57:29;"But that also makes me think that realistically,"
57:29;57:32;"our version is a bit too dark."
57:32;57:34;"We live in the MCU world now."
57:34;57:37;"Where truly, and I hate to say this,"
57:37;57:39;"it's just so much less interesting."
57:39;57:41;"But I think like,"
57:41;57:42;"there's probably some version"
57:42;57:44;"where we create a bunch of like superheroes"
57:44;57:46;"and they roll up to town together."
57:46;57:48;"No, but let's keep it like"
57:48;57:51;"on the realistic side of comics, you know, like-"
57:51;57:53;"- Yeah, harsh realism."
57:53;57:54;"Just like Rambo first blood style."
57:54;57:56;"- We're going for like the dark side of Marvel."
57:56;58:00;"The Punisher, Nick Fury, these kinds of people."
58:00;58:01;"- His name is John Pepperoni."
58:01;58:04;"(laughing)"
58:04;58:08;"Colonel Pepperoni is doing a residency in West Hollywood."
58:08;58:09;"(laughing)"
58:09;58:12;"- And then he has an arch enemy who's doing the same thing."
58:12;58:16;"And there's like, there's kind of like this deep fear."
58:16;58:18;"There's an undercurrent of deep fear in the country."
58:18;58:20;"'Cause we always have a vague sense"
58:20;58:23;"of where John Pepperoni is."
58:23;58:25;"But then there's also like Frank Mushroom."
58:25;58:27;"- Major deep dish."
58:27;58:28;"- Yeah, like just imagine that."
58:28;58:31;"We kind of like, we have a very simple map"
58:31;58:32;"and you're always monitoring them."
58:32;58:33;"And then you get this like,"
58:33;58:35;"they're on the two different coasts."
58:35;58:38;"And we kind of like start to feed this story about like,"
58:38;58:40;"when these guys see each other,"
58:40;58:42;"they'll have no choice but to kill each other."
58:42;58:44;"It's gonna be pandemonium."
58:44;58:46;"And then just like, little by little,"
58:46;58:47;"they're both heading in direction."
58:47;58:49;"And then, you know, all the fans are watching."
58:49;58:50;"Just like, holy (beep)"
58:50;58:52;"these guys are about to meet up in Chicago."
58:52;58:56;"And then we have this like whole narrative battle Chicago."
58:56;58:58;"I don't know what form that actually takes."
58:58;59:01;"- I like that, you know, I can see the taken thing"
59:01;59:02;"has me think it's like, yeah,"
59:02;59:06;"like John Pepperoni's going to Los Angeles"
59:06;59:10;"to visit his estranged daughter."
59:10;59:11;"They haven't spoken in years."
59:11;59:13;"- Right. - And then when he gets there."
59:13;59:15;"- He'll be making pizzas in West Hollywood"
59:15;59:16;"for three weeks. - He's gonna be making"
59:16;59:17;"for three weeks."
59:17;59:18;"But then when he gets there,"
59:18;59:20;"he's like, his daughter's not there."
59:20;59:23;"- But he's sold her six months in advance though."
59:23;59:25;"- Yeah, but the daughter's been taken"
59:25;59:28;"by this competitor now is in Chicago."
59:28;59:29;"I just feel like there's like a lot."
59:29;59:31;"- But he has to stay, but he's booked out time."
59:31;59:34;"He has to stay in West Hollywood for three weeks."
59:34;59:35;"- To finish out his order."
59:35;59:38;"- He's sold three weeks of pizza six months in advance."
59:38;59:39;"So even though his daughter's been taken,"
59:39;59:41;"he has to like fulfill his contract"
59:41;59:42;"and make the pizza."
59:42;59:43;"- I love the idea. - It's a great pizza."
59:43;59:46;"- I love the idea of like the pizza being his burden,"
59:46;59:48;"like almost like his duty."
59:48;59:50;"Like he doesn't take it. - It's his cross to bear."
59:50;59:51;"- It's his cross to bear, exactly."
59:51;59:54;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
59:54;59:56;"- He's a Christ figure. - Very grim."
59:56;59:56;"- He was put on his--"
59:56;59:58;"- Man, I watched ""Rambo First Blood"" last year."
59:58;01:00:00;"That movie is so legit."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"That's one of the best Vietnam movies."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Just weird sidetrack, but just shout out."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Just shout out to ""First Blood."""
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- No, I know you're a big ""Rambo"" fan."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Hard recommend to the audience."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"- There's definitely something here."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I mean, basically it's like food truck"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"meets kind of narrative storytelling."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"'Cause you know, I remember there used to be this excitement."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Ooh, that food truck comes on Tuesdays"
01:00:19;01:00:20;"to this park or something."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Also to really build, not a food truck,"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"but some kind of like, what car would he have?"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Just like some-- (laughs)"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"- A tank, dude. (laughs)"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"- I think it's a makeshift food truck"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"that he like constructed himself."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"And it's pretty good."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Like he did a pretty good job."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- Bulletproof. - And it's painted"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"with like camo and stuff."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"- Totally. - Dude, no, dude."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"I like that it's like $300 pizzas"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"and you have to, to sell a $300 pizza,"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"you have to commit to the aesthetic."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"So it's a tank that's parked on Sunset Boulevard"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"for three weeks."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"It got the clearance from the city."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"And there's like dudes with like rifles,"
01:00:56;01:01:00;"like standing like, next to the tank."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And it's like a full performance art thing."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"The pizza has to be really good, too."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"You have to like back it up."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- Wait, real quick, 'cause I felt,"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"can you find anybody in America"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"who's actually named John Pepperoni?"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"I love the idea of keeping it authentic"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"by working backwards."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- John!"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- I feel like generally,"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"almost any Italian word you can think of,"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"there often is somebody with that name."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"Like I've heard of people with the last name Pizza."
01:01:23;01:01:23;"Why not Pepperoni?"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"- Yeah."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"I mean, the first results are,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I'm just on whitepages.com now,"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"'cause the first Google results"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"are like Papa John's Pepperoni."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Oh, yeah, no, no, no."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- Yeah."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"- Okay, first result is a (beep) Pepperoni."
01:01:38;01:01:38;"That's with,"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"what?"
01:01:40;01:01:43;"One P-E-P-E-R-O-N-E."
01:01:43;01:01:47;"- Pepperoni as a last name would be so sick."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"- There are alternate spellings."
01:01:49;01:01:54;"I have a John Pepperoni, P-E-P-E-R-O-N-E."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"- I kinda like that. - Pepperon?"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- Oh, he might say Pepperon, but yeah, okay."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Pepperon. - John Pepperon."
01:01:59;01:02:03;"- Seems like Pepperon is actually a pretty common surname."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"- No other Pepperonis, I feel like we've really blown up."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- So it's just (beep) Pepperoni?"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- I'm bought here."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Maybe bleep the (beep) for her privacy,"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"'cause it seems like there aren't."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"Oh, there's a JP Pepperoni as well."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Okay, I'm into that JP Pepperoni."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"- Pretty smooth."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"(laughing)"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Imagine seeing that on a business card."
01:02:22;01:02:26;"- Yeah, just like, private eye, JP Pepperoni."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"- Honestly. - Restaurant consultant."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"- It is actually way cooler for the story."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"It makes it a little less madcap kooky"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"if it is just spelled Pepperon."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"I mean, that would actually be"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"in some hard-boiled detective novel"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"where he's this guy kinda crisscrossing the country"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"serving pizza and people are just like,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"""Mr. Pepperoni, I can't thank you enough."""
01:02:47;01:02:49;"And he's like, ""It's Pepperon."""
01:02:49;01:02:54;"That would be his little thing at the end of every episode."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"His Pepperon."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"- Okay, so we got a new business"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"to compliment Punisher Burgers."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"We got Colonel Pepperonis."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- Colonel Pepperon."

01:03:47;01:03:48;"- Yeah."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"- I have a feeling he'll be with us for a long time."
01:03:50;01:03:54;"And I personally feel a sense of calm"
01:03:54;01:03:57;"knowing that he's driving across this country"
01:03:58;01:04:03;"in his camo food truck, his camo food truck tank,"
01:04:03;01:04:08;"making $300 pizzas and battling his sworn enemies."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"We have avoided the Noid."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"Jake, do you wanna talk about the Noid now?"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- I don't."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"I'm good."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"I think we like tapped out on,"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"we've been talking about dominoes for a long time."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"I think for the sake of the show,"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"we should like transition to another topic."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- Okay, you got good instincts, Jake."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- I do think we should bring back the Noid at some point."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- Yeah, maybe another show."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I just don't think,"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"I don't think two hours of dominoes"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"is like a great vibe for the show."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"I mean, it's a solid vibe."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"It's not a great vibe though."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"(laughing)"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- That's a ""This Show Sucks"" moment."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"- Yeah, like, damn, those guys are,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"they're skipping the top five this week"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"to talk about the Noid?"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"- I was kind of into the Pepperon stuff,"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"but then it got really dry,"
01:04:53;01:04:56;"just like at an hour 52 minutes,"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"just like, now they went back to when Bain Capital bought it"
01:04:59;01:05:04;"and Jake's breaking down kind of like the deal points."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"Just like, whoa, you know what?"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"This show sucks."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"- And this has been this week's time crisis."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"- Yeah, we're just in the middle of like,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"and then the Noid, oh, (beep)"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"ran out of time."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Okay, see you guys in two weeks."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"This show sucks."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"All right, Jake."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"I do want to talk about the Noid at some point,"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"but you're right, we've gone pretty deep on Domino's."
01:05:26;01:05:29;"I will say, you never know when we start going deep"
01:05:29;01:05:29;"on one of these things."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Sometimes it's more or less what you expect."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Sometimes it's just funny."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"There is something about Domino's that it did feel"
01:05:36;01:05:41;"like we tapped into something weird, fascinating,"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"dark, futuristic, militaristic."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"- Yeah, I like the Domino's RoboCop connection"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"'cause I think RoboCop was set in Detroit too."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"So it's like, there's some real Michigan energy."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"- So the last thing we'll say is,"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"if anybody listening knows anybody who delivered"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"in the 30 minutes or less era,"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"please, we'd love to talk to you."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Maybe if anybody knows somebody"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"who currently delivers in India, we'd love to talk to you."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"And if we have any TC heads in Houston"
01:06:09;01:06:13;"who are Domino's fans, please try to get a delivery"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"from the autonomous vehicle."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"- I'd love to see footage of that."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"- Just also picture like back in like the early 90s,"
01:06:19;01:06:22;"just like pitching something in Hollywood."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"Okay, the film takes place in the year 2021."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"An autonomous pizza delivery vehicle"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"has just hit the streets of Houston."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"What's that?"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"- It's full RoboCop."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- It's full Demolition Man too"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"when Taco Bell is the only restaurant"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"that has survived the restaurant wars."
01:06:41;01:06:45;"- I never saw Demolition Man."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"Is that-"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"- I feel like that's set in like 2014 or something."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"- It's just like, this movie,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"it was like from the mid 90s,"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"it was set like 20 years in the future."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"And I was just like-"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- Like Sylvester Stallone is at like the high end Taco Bell."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- It was 2032."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Oh, 2032."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Honestly, not that far off."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- All right, Taco Bell, you got 11 years left"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"to win the restaurant wars."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- If we're still doing TC in 2032,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"we should really do a deep dive on Demolition Man."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"That'll be the theme."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- Mark your calendars."
01:07:17;01:07:21;"- Okay, so we're gonna transition to Billy Joel."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"- As you do."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- It's somewhat painful."
01:07:24;01:07:28;"I'm still so enchanted by this strange,"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"dystopian Domino's world,"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"but it is Billy Joel's birthday."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"So how old is he turning today?"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- 72."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"- Happy 72nd birthday, Mr. Joel."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"I was thinking, what song should we look at?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"I mean, there's so many classic BJ songs."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"And we may have mentioned this song,"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"but I don't think we ever went deep on it."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"This seemed like an interesting one."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"And actually, I felt like I was getting a vibe"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"off some of the new brews."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"I don't wanna blow up your spot, Jake."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"But one of them had a slightly dystopian,"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"climate change, anxiety vibe."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Is that fair to say?"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- Sure, yeah."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- Is that like a theme?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- 97 in the shade."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"- Yeah, it's one about how hot it's getting."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"It actually seemed like, from what I've heard,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"there's something of a preoccupation"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"with natural disasters and climate."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"Is there a theme developing?"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"- Yeah, I like writing songs about that stuff."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"I mean, I like writing songs about drinking."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"And I like writing songs about"
01:08:25;01:08:29;"just sort of like general time going by"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"and what does that mean?"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"And what is the future gonna look like?"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"But making it sound like an Eagle song."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- Yeah, actually, now I'm thinking back"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"on your first hit, ""Mountain Bruise."""
01:08:41;01:08:42;"Beautiful song."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"There's this moment when the narrator"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"is up at the top of a mountain"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"looking at the buildings below."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"And then says, ""Wouldn't take much"

01:08:52;01:08:54;"""All the buildings look like dominoes."""

01:08:59;01:09:02;"♪ Wouldn't take much for them to topple and go ♪"

01:09:03;01:09:06;"That's the, it's just kind of like"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"cracking a brew on the top of a mountain"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"looking at those buildings,"
01:09:08;01:09:12;"saying, ""Damn, this (beep) could be just flattened one day."

01:09:17;01:09:19;"""Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile."""
01:09:19;01:09:21;"- That's the bruise vibe, dude."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"- That's the bruise vibe."

01:09:25;01:09:26;"and then thinking about ""Billy Joel,"""

01:09:31;01:09:32;"but it wasn't a single."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"So like a lot of people don't know it."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And it's speaking of like, you know,"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"choosing years that sounded futuristic"

01:10:19;01:10:22;"and not so much like apocalyptic."
01:10:22;01:10:26;"Like apocalyptic to me is like futuristic."

01:11:45;01:11:46;"A lot going on."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"- A lot going on."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"This song also to me says so much about Billy Joel"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"because like, you know,"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"of course you could pick some classic,"
01:11:53;01:11:57;"Piano Man, New York State of Mind."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"- Scenes from an Italian restaurant."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"- Scenes from an Italian restaurant."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"And actually all those songs I think contain"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"a bit of his ambition and his depth of feeling."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"But there's something about this song"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"where you're kind of like, you know what?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Billy Joel's like a deep thinker."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"He's kind of angry."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"He's kind of pessimistic."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"He's like a funny choice for like a,"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"a kind of a song and dance man."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I mean this, like somebody might say I'm totally wrong,"
01:12:20;01:12:24;"but it's like, he was almost like the Bruno Mars of his day."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Just like this super talented hit maker"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"can kind of try things in different genres."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Maybe one day Bruno Mars will release some like,"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"really like angry music."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"And definitely some of his like later hits"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"have a slightly like eerier feeling."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"But I just feel like Billy Joel's this guy who probably,"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"I think probably part of the drama of his professional life"
01:12:44;01:12:48;"was feeling like, people think I'm like Barry Manilow."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Like making easy listening stuff."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"But no, I'm like a dude, I'm haunted by visions"
01:12:53;01:12:56;"of the place where I'm from being laid,"
01:12:56;01:13:00;"you know, turning into ruins."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"He's like Cassandra, the oracle,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"where he could see the future,"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"but nobody would believe it."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"And in his case, it's because the songs"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"are just so beautiful."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"And he was just so good at writing pop songs."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"But he, like weirdly, this song is like,"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"I can't even know what to compare it to."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"It's like some dark like prog song."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"But anyway, I seen the lights go out on Broadway."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"I saw the Empire State laid low."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"And life went on beyond the Palisades."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Everybody head out."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"And this is where it gets very interesting."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Like you could just write a whole thing about just like,"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"you could just think of other New York landmarks"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"and be like, and Times Square was empty."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"And Central Park was full of animals."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"And the, you know, Statue of Liberty was,"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"fell into the ocean."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"But then he pivots to this weird thing."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"They held a concert out in Brooklyn"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"to watch the island bridges blow."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"So he's like getting weirdly specific"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"where he's like really envisioning this like formal thing"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"where they're like, Manhattan's a rap."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"And he, also this idea,"
01:14:02;01:14:06;"'cause this is like a classic trope in TV and movies"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"of blowing the bridges to Manhattan."
01:14:08;01:14:12;"Like, I feel like that's part of like Escape from New York,"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"which came out years after this,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"where it's kind of like Manhattan was like left"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"as like this kind of prison complex"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"and like all the bridges were blown"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"because like nobody can go there"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"'cause it's a danger zone."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"So this idea that like Billy Joel's writing this,"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"you know, he's not the first person to imagine New York"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"or any major city abandoned."
01:14:30;01:14:34;"But he suddenly goes from like these scenes of emptiness"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"and then just imagining like this,"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"a big concert being held on the day,"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"they blow up the bridges to make sure nobody can,"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"there's something about that that I'm just like,"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"damn, Billy, where'd you get that one?"
01:14:45;01:14:48;"That's like kind of weird and deep and like--"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- Also, they held a concert out in Brooklyn."
01:14:50;01:14:54;"He's like foreshadowing the exodus"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"from Manhattan into Brooklyn."
01:14:56;01:15:00;"The shift of the cultural center towards Brooklyn."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"He was just gobbling up real estate in Williamsburg"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"on the cheap back then."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- He's buying all those properties over on Bedford"
01:15:07;01:15:12;"and I don't even remember the streets over there, whatever."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"What are the other streets in Brooklyn, in that area?"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- Roebling."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"- Oh yeah, okay, yeah."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"- No, Billy Joel owns like three full blocks of Roebling."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"They turned our power down and drove us underground,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"but we went right on with the show."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"See, now I don't even, I'm a little bit confused,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"but still, the fact that he's picturing this weird mix"
01:15:31;01:15:35;"of like the mundane and the apocalyptic is like kind of deep."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"Okay, let's listen to the second verse."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"- Let's keep going."

01:19:00;01:19:02;"- Well, and it's also funny that he chose Miami"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"because people often refer to Miami"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"as being more vulnerable than--"

01:20:37;01:20:38;"I mean, obviously it's written"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"from like a '70s New York perspective,"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"although I guess they say he was in LA when he wrote it,"
01:20:43;01:20:48;"but still, he's a Long Island guy, tri-state area dude."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"So he's picturing everybody moved to Florida,"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"which is interesting 'cause during COVID"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"that became this whole thing about like,"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"oh, are people abandoning New York?"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"And Miami seems to be like popping"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"and people wanna go there."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"But then the idea that the mafia took over Mexico,"
01:21:02;01:21:06;"again, coming from this like '70s New York perspective,"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"imagining that like the New York mafia"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"would just grow and grow in power."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"- Yeah, he's not talking about the Mexican drug cartels."
01:21:15;01:21:20;"He's talking about like John Pepperoni taking over Mexico."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"- Yeah, that didn't quite happen."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"- That didn't pan out."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"- But in a weird way, the song kind of sticks to landing."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"There are not many who remember."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"They say a handful still survive to tell the world"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"about the way the lights went out and keep the memory alive."
01:21:32;01:21:36;"So in a weird way, he was correct in that,"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"I've never seen it, but I like what you're saying, Jake,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"the final episode of ""The Deuce"" vibe."
01:21:41;01:21:46;"Billy was correct in that this period that he was seeing"
01:21:46;01:21:51;"that seemed to him this period of intense,"
01:21:51;01:21:54;"things falling apart, this crazy era of New York"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"where he could, where he'd be like,"

01:22:02;01:22:04;"This place will be forgotten."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"And Miami will be like the new cultural center."""
01:22:06;01:22:10;"He was correct in the sense that that moment"
01:22:10;01:22:13;"is kind of forgotten, that the people who really lived it"
01:22:13;01:22:16;"and were part of the culture of that moment,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"very few of them are around."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"And even if they're around,"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"the world they live in is so different"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"that their memory, yeah,"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"a handful of people keep the memory alive."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I guess that's true about apocalyptic stuff."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"It's like either it pans out"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"and truly the city's in ruins"
01:22:32;01:22:37;"and grass will grow over your city and it's forgotten,"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"or it doesn't, and even that intense moment"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"of pain and darkness is forgotten either way."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- Damn."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"I remember, this is kind of related to the song."

01:22:59;01:23:03;"Not at the stadium, but the final Yankees game."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"Are they gonna know it's the final Yankees game?"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Is it just that the culture will shift"

01:23:29;01:23:31;"No one knew at the time."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"I remember thinking being at a Yankees game"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"in this massive stadium with 40,000 people"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"watching this culturally significant event."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"And it seems so permanent."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"If you think about museums,"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"when will the last day of the Metropolitan Museum of Art"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"in New York City be open?"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"These things will happen."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"- But will people know?"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"- And will it be cataclysmic"
01:23:53;01:23:58;"or will it be just a gradual shift in cultural priorities?"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"- Generally, there's a feeling that a lot of things"
01:24:00;01:24:04;"are too big to fail and you would think they wouldn't know"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"and it would have to be something really cataclysmic."
01:24:06;01:24:11;"But yeah, I don't see baseball being done in our lifetimes."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"But it's a good question."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Could there be something,"
01:24:14;01:24:17;"will there still be baseball in 200 years?"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"What's the first sport that's gonna go?"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"Hockey?"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"Well, not in Canada, but in the US."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"- Things fade, so I don't know."
01:24:25;01:24:26;"I don't know."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"And that's what Billy's kind of writing about, right?"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"I mean, he's talking about things fading,"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"but also things blowing up."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"I don't know."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"It's not like the most specific song."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- Right."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Which is cool, it's a song."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"It doesn't need to be specific."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"- Miami 2017."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- Wonder if Billy's got real estate down in Miami."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- I would guess so."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- Oh, for sure."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"- Well, I mean, that's what Matt just said to me"
01:24:49;01:24:53;"that that's why Billy picked Miami was specifically"
01:24:53;01:24:58;"because when New Yorkers get old, they go to Miami."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"- Right."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"- I think there'll be a point when real estate in Miami"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"just becomes worthless."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Not yet."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"- A friend who's moving there right now says it is popping."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Really?"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"- Says it is popping."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"It's like you can't,"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"it's just shot through the roof, interestingly,"
01:25:13;01:25:18;"because there's a whole tech boom that's happening in Miami."
01:25:18;01:25:23;"But to your point, it feels like the whole area"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"would be uninsurable 'cause it's all gonna be underwater."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"So it is like the last gasps."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"I mean, it's like the idea that people would move"
01:25:31;01:25:35;"out there feels, that feels apocalyptic."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"- Well, maybe with all that money there,"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"they'll figure it out."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- In 2013--"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"- Tech money, they'll raise it up."
01:25:40;01:25:45;"- In 2013, Billy Joel sold his Miami Beach mansion"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"to an Italian--"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- Wait, hold on, how much?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"No, you don't tell me."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"I wanna know what the group thinks."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Oh, yeah."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"- How much did Billy Joel--"
01:25:55;01:25:55;"- Wait, sorry, what was it?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Miami Beach mansion?"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- In 2013?"
01:25:57;01:26:02;"- Joel does, 2013, and it's on La Gorce Island."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"Does anybody know what the La Gorce--"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"- No, but I know there's these really fancy islands"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"in that area."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"- 18 million."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"- I was gonna guess right around there."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"All right, so I'll go a little bit higher."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"I'll say 21.4."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- 14 million."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- Okay."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"- I like when we over-guess."
01:26:21;01:26:24;"- A modest property for Mr. Joel."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"All right, let's get in the top five."
01:26:26;01:26:31;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:26:31;01:26:36;"- We're just gonna do the top five hits of 1971."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Why 1971?"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"- That was the year that Billy dropped his first record,"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"right?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"- Yep, I believe his first solo album."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Did that have Piano Man on it?"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- No, not yet."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"This one doesn't really have any hits."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I think it's called Cold Spring Harbor."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"- Like Cold Spring New York?"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Isn't that a town?"
01:26:53;01:26:57;"- Yeah, and Cold Spring Harbor's on Long Island."
01:26:57;01:26:57;"- Oh, I see."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"That makes sense."
01:26:59;01:26:59;"- So this, you know,"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"Billy was still not particularly known yet in '71,"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"but he was starting to spread his wings as a solo artist."
01:27:05;01:27:08;"The number five song, ""Bread"" with ""If."""

01:31:31;01:31:33;"in a movie about Lenny Bruce?"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"- Or the one that Dustin Hoffman played Lenny Bruce in?"

01:32:46;01:32:49;"- Yeah it's a pretty like strange chorus."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"- Well you're talking about like Billy Joel"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"like having this pop sheen with these like"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"weird dark lyrics."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"This takes it to like another level."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"- No Neil Diamond's got a deep side."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"He's like, I think he was also frustrated"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"about the way he was seen."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"- I love that Neil was included in the last waltz."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"- Oh right."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"- The final band concert."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"- They had some respect for him."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"- In like '76 or whatever that was."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"When you have like fully coked out Van Morrison,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"friend of the show."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"And then yeah Neil comes out."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"It's just like, it's all like hip people."
01:33:19;01:33:23;"It's like Joni and like Neil Young."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"And then like Neil Diamond's there"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"and it's like whoa cool, weird."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He probably felt like he was rolling up to a garden party."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Just like a mile and a quarter."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- Oh absolutely."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"- A little bit out of place like whoa."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"But no Neil Diamond's like,"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"he's written a lot of beautiful songs"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"and like I always think too like,"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"I mean this one's overtly,"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"he's probably you know trying to be kind of existential."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"I mean it's such a heavy chorus, I am."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"- But he pulls it off."
01:33:47;01:33:47;"- No totally."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"But I even think about some of his songs"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"that are seen as like pretty simple."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"Like Red Red Wine which has always been"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"one of my favorite songs."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Like I love all the versions."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"- The Ubi version is (beep) sick."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"- That's great."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"Ubi 40 version's beautiful."
01:34:02;01:34:05;"And I always, the version I first got into was,"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"you know when I was a kid I was so into ska."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Third wave ska."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"But also all of it."
01:34:11;01:34:14;"So I would, some of like the earliest CDs I bought"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"when I was like 12, 13 were like"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"compilations of like 60s Jamaican ska."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"And so there's this great version by Tony Tribe"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"that was like way before Ubi 40."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"There's this kind of up-tempo ska version."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"♪ Red red wine dun dun dun ♪"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"♪ Da dun dun dun dun ♪"
01:34:31;01:34:34;"And it seems like such a silly childish song"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"when you just kind of take it in."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"You know you can feel the sadness,"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"but you know it's like red red wine."
01:34:39;01:34:43;"It sounds like a cute nursery rhyme kind of."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"And then when you just like realize"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"that it really is just a song about"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"kind of like alcoholic depression."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"And he also kind of sticks the landing on that too."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Just like, I don't know if I have the lyrics exactly right,"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"but that line always gets me."

01:45:50;01:45:53;"to 80s hair metal Christian rock,"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"but you actually listen to it and it's not a fun hang."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"- And I think there's like a pretty deep zone"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"that I've heard about from people"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"who I know were like in that scene"

01:46:08;01:46:09;"- Yeah."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"- Probably was true like on some very independent (beep)"

01:46:19;01:46:21;"- Page of the Lion, the first few records are killer."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"I saw them so many times,"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"like living up in Portland and the Pacific Northwest,"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"like early, late 90s."
01:46:27;01:46:31;"- So they bridge the gap between the GBV heads"
