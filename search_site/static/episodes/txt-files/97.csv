00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, ask me anything."
00:04;00:08;"It's time to open the floodgates"
00:08;00:14;"and let the TC heads ask Jake and I about what really matters."
00:14;00:20;"Too often has this show been bound by the rigid structures of late night news."
00:20;00:23;"Finally, we're gonna go on some flights of fancy"
00:23;00:26;"and let the show take us wherever it wants to go."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:35;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:14;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:14;01:19;"He's the lonely man."
01:19;01:21;"It's Time Crisis back once again."
01:21;01:24;"And guess what? We're down in the bank."
01:24;01:25;"What's up, Jake?"
01:25;01:26;"Hey, man."
01:26;01:30;"Look, this summer, this spring summer was a real time crisis."
01:30;01:32;"We were all over the map, man."
01:32;01:36;"I was everywhere from Minneapolis to Poland."
01:36;01:37;"So we had to bank some EPS."
01:37;01:38;"Sounds like a song, right?"
01:38;01:40;"Banking the EPS?"
01:40;01:43;"From Minneapolis to Poland."
01:43;01:45;"Mama, I've been banking the EPS."
01:45;01:48;"I think ultimately, though, banking the EPS hasn't been a bad thing."
01:48;01:49;"No, it's been fun."
01:49;01:51;"I think we've gotten some really good banked EPS."
01:51;01:55;"And, you know, we'll get back to a little more, you know, some more timely conversations."
01:55;02:01;"But the truth is, I think Time Crisis needed some pauses to bank some EPS,"
02:01;02:05;"dig back into the mailbag as we did on one banked EPS, do a subway series."
02:05;02:07;"You know, we've been doing all sorts of interesting stuff."
02:07;02:11;"It's really challenged us creatively."
02:11;02:17;"So on this banked EPS, which was recorded at an undisclosed location in an undisclosed time,"
02:17;02:21;"who knows, it could have been yesterday, could have been three years ago, who knows."
02:21;02:25;"We're going to kind of center this one around an AMA,"
02:25;02:29;"because a lot of times on Time Crisis we're talking about the news of the day."
02:29;02:33;"We're getting into that razor sharp analysis."
02:33;02:37;"We don't always have time to kind of get into it, talk to the fans, you know."
02:37;02:41;"We don't have time to really stretch out and go on flights of fancy, you know."
02:41;02:47;"We're doing a Rachel Maddow style news program, and, you know, there's just things we have to get through."
02:47;02:48;"Highly planned."
02:48;02:52;"Highly planned. We don't always have time to just shoot the s***,"
02:52;02:57;"just talk about life or, you know, chase an idea down a little rabbit hole."
02:57;02:59;"We don't always have time for that."
02:59;03:01;"And that's what I love about these banked EPS."
03:01;03:04;"We can break from the format a little bit and kind of just stretch out."
03:54;04:06;"So anyway, we haven't done this in a long time."
04:06;04:09;"We haven't done any sort of AMA thing with the fans."
04:09;04:12;"That's always a good way to trigger conversation, you know."
04:12;04:14;"So this banked EPS is the AMA EPS."
04:14;04:18;"And Seinfeld, you've been asking the fans for good questions."
04:18;04:20;"Did you give them any parameters?"
04:20;04:23;"No, I just said, you know, we're in the studio right now."
04:23;04:26;"Whatever you want to ask, just fire away."
04:26;04:28;"So no parameters, no limits, no boundaries, really."
04:28;04:31;"Okay, cool. So where to start?"
04:31;04:34;"Well, how do we even organize? How many of you you've gotten so far?"
04:34;04:36;"About 150."
04:36;04:37;"Oh, that's a lot."
04:37;04:39;"I mean, we're all over the map."
04:39;04:41;"I really should have set some boundaries."
04:41;04:44;"There are questions about, you know, Vampire Weekend, about food,"
04:44;04:48;"other artists that we haven't really touched on that much on the show."
04:48;04:51;"Some stuff for just for Jake about his art."
04:51;04:53;"Let's start with a Jake question, kick things off."
04:53;04:54;"All right."
04:54;04:59;"So the question comes from @KaleDinosaur."
04:59;05:01;"Good name."
05:01;05:04;"What's Jake working on in the studio right now?"
05:04;05:07;"I'd also enjoy a deep dive into Jake's art in general."
05:07;05:09;"That's true."
05:09;05:12;"Well, I'm working on a show that's going to be opening in September"
05:12;05:15;"at Nino Meyer Gallery in Los Angeles."
05:15;05:19;"One room of architecture paintings, one room of landscape paintings."
05:19;05:22;"I'm working on a painting of an office max right now."
05:22;05:24;"It's six by seven feet."
05:24;05:25;"Big. Huge."
05:25;05:27;"It'll be a painting of a Toys R Us."
05:27;05:30;"It'll be a painting of a Circuit City."
05:30;05:33;"Question, is the Toys R Us in business?"
05:33;05:34;"Nope."
05:34;05:36;"This is a closed down Toys R Us you're painting."
05:36;05:37;"Indeed."
05:37;05:38;"Can you sense the abandonment?"
05:38;05:40;"Can you sense that it's closed down?"
05:40;05:43;"Yeah, there's plywood over the doors, and the sign has been removed,"
05:43;05:48;"but there's like that sort of like ghost of the Toys R Us logo written in filth."
05:48;05:49;"Yeah."
05:49;05:50;"You know when you--"
05:50;05:51;"Right, right."
05:51;05:52;"Grime."
05:52;05:53;"Yeah."
05:53;05:54;"Was that from a photographing one?"
05:54;05:57;"That's an image--it was based on an image I found online"
05:57;06:01;"because I will sometimes just Google image search Quiznos Orlando."
06:01;06:02;"See what pops up."
06:02;06:03;"See what you get."
06:03;06:04;"Yeah."
06:04;06:06;"So I'm working on stuff like that, big paintings."
06:06;06:11;"Actually, leading into that, there's a question from Prairie Goth, Prairie_Goth."
06:11;06:14;"I'm in art school, and it's a wild ride."
06:14;06:18;"What's @Dongstrath's best art school memory?"
06:18;06:24;"Doing a field trip to Las Vegas with Larry Sultan, RIP."
06:24;06:25;"Who's that, a professor?"
06:25;06:29;"Yeah, he was a legendary photographer and teacher."
06:29;06:31;"Academics love Las Vegas."
06:31;06:32;"He took us to Vegas."
06:32;06:33;"It was super fun."
06:33;06:34;"Learning from Las Vegas."
06:34;06:35;"Isn't that like a book?"
06:35;06:37;"Yeah, that's--"
06:37;06:38;"Rem Koolhaas or like an architect?"
06:38;06:40;"No, it's like Venturi, and I forget the name."
06:40;06:41;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right."
06:41;06:46;"It's like a pair of writers, and they wrote about the vernacular architecture"
06:46;06:47;"of the American West."
06:47;06:50;"And there's also--there's an academic whose name is like--oh, God,"
06:50;06:52;"I'm going to get Robert Mackey or something."
06:52;06:56;"There's like a professor at the University of Las Vegas who writes art criticism,"
06:56;06:57;"and I remember--"
06:57;06:58;"Oh, Dave Hickey."
06:58;06:59;"Dave Hickey, yeah, Dave Hickey."
06:59;07:00;"Dave Hickey is awesome."
07:00;07:02;"In fact, we tried to meet him."
07:02;07:06;"Larry knew him a little bit and tried calling him,"
07:06;07:08;"or we went to his office, but we didn't cross paths."
07:08;07:09;"Yeah."
07:09;07:10;"Well, you know, so while we're on the subject,"
07:10;07:14;"because I don't want this episode just to be like question, question, question,"
07:14;07:15;"what's art school all about?"
07:15;07:18;"I think both these questions point to something, Jake."
07:18;07:21;"Everybody who listens to TC knows that you're an American painter"
07:21;07:22;"and radio personality."
07:22;07:25;"But we actually--and maybe I don't even have all the answers--"
07:25;07:28;"know your full back story as a painter."
07:28;07:29;"Yeah."
07:29;07:30;"You're a musician, too."
07:30;07:34;"You've played in bands, guitarists, written songs."
07:34;07:38;"What was your path to painting becoming like your medium?"
07:38;07:41;"Because at some point, you're like a creative dude."
07:41;07:43;"You've done a lot of different things."
07:43;07:47;"Was it always obvious that you were just going to--that painting was like the thing?"
07:47;07:52;"I mean, since I was a kid, I was always into two-dimensional art."
07:52;07:55;"I was always into drawing and painting."
07:55;08:00;"I mean, I guess the painting didn't really start in earnest until like college years."
08:00;08:05;"But definitely high school was a lot of drawing, baseball players, making comic books."
08:05;08:06;"And then--"
08:06;08:09;"And then in college, did you major in fine art?"
08:09;08:11;"I majored in art, and then I chose painting."
08:11;08:16;"I remember I was divided between graphic design, which seemed very practical,"
08:16;08:17;"and then painting."
08:17;08:19;"I remember the graphic design teacher was a cool guy,"
08:19;08:22;"but I remember him making fun of the fine artists and the painters"
08:22;08:24;"for being impractical."
08:24;08:25;"That's what put you over the edge?"
08:25;08:27;"I was sort of like, ""Uh,"" but it's--"
08:27;08:30;"I thought it was just nerdy and kind of lame to do that."
08:30;08:31;"And like, ""What am I going to do?"
08:31;08:34;"Oh, I could design a label for a soft drink?"""
08:34;08:37;"I remember I was working on a redesign of the Mountain Dew logo."
08:37;08:39;"Oh, wait. I think you have a reference to that book."
08:39;08:40;"It was a project."
08:40;08:41;"I remember thinking--"
08:41;08:42;"I mean, that sounds pretty tight."
08:42;08:43;"And I was like, ""Painting is cooler."""
08:43;08:44;"Wait, wait, but he--"
08:44;08:45;"But I had no idea what it meant."
08:45;08:47;"Like, the art world is very oblique."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah."
08:48;08:51;"I wasn't like, ""I'm going to make a living painting,"" when I was 22."
08:51;08:53;"You were just like, ""I have to choose a major."""
08:53;08:57;"Yeah, because some people have their relationship to their major being like,"
08:57;08:59;"""I'm going to be a computer science major,"
08:59;09:02;"and I'm going to get a job writing code, and that's cool."""
09:02;09:03;"I was an art major."

10:48;10:50;"I mean, I have to say, there wasn't, like,"
10:50;10:52;"there wasn't, like, a clear plan of attack."
10:52;10:55;"And I think that's true of most art majors."
10:55;10:56;"What was your major?"
10:56;10:58;"English. Pretty similar."
10:58;10:59;"Yeah, it's very similar."
10:59;11:01;"Yeah, I think I got to college..."
11:01;11:04;"I don't know if deep down I always believed"
11:04;11:06;"that I would end up being a musician,"
11:06;11:08;"or I hoped-- maybe I didn't want to admit it,"
11:08;11:10;"but I hoped deep down, like, that's where I'd end up,"
11:10;11:13;"'cause I was fairly serious in high school"
11:13;11:15;"outside of my sophomore year."
11:15;11:16;"I don't know why."
11:16;11:18;"I just, like, got some Bs my sophomore year."
11:18;11:21;"But the rest of high school, I, like, took it seriously,"
11:21;11:24;"'cause I had this vague sense, ""Okay, you need to do well"
11:24;11:26;"in high school so you can go to a good college."""
11:26;11:27;"'Cause I remember in, like, middle school,"
11:27;11:29;"sometimes my parents would be hard on me, like,"
11:29;11:32;"""Oh, you didn't study for your 8th grade social studies test?"""
11:32;11:34;"And I remember at the time just being like,"
11:34;11:35;"""Guys, come on."
11:35;11:37;"This literally doesn't count for anything."
11:37;11:38;"It's gonna work out."""
11:38;11:41;"- And I understand from the point of view of parents"
11:41;11:43;"probably being like, ""That doesn't sound very promising."""
11:43;11:44;"But that's how I felt."
11:44;11:46;"So then I was like, ""When I get to my freshman year,"
11:46;11:47;"I'm gonna tighten [bleep] up."""
11:47;11:48;"And my freshman year, I did."
11:48;11:50;"I started getting good grades. - Look at you."
11:50;11:51;"- I got it together."
11:51;11:52;"Then my sophomore year,"
11:52;11:54;"it's like a couple classes I hated,"
11:54;11:56;"and, you know, I dipped a little bit."
11:56;11:57;"But then my junior year,"
11:57;11:59;"I also knew that junior year is, like, really important."
11:59;12:02;"And again, I got real focused, and I got good grades,"
12:02;12:05;"because I knew I needed to go to, like, a good school."
12:05;12:07;"That seemed important. - Mm-hmm."
12:07;12:09;"- Even when I was applying to schools,"
12:09;12:11;"I think I just had a sense of, like,"
12:11;12:14;"I should go to a good East Coast school."
12:14;12:17;"I didn't really have any interest in, like, leaving the area."
12:17;12:18;"- Tri-state boy."
12:18;12:19;"- I was pretty tri-state."
12:19;12:21;"Or at least, like, New England."
12:21;12:22;"I don't know. Yeah, it's funny."
12:22;12:23;"- Did you apply to Yale?"
12:23;12:25;"- I didn't apply to Yale. I don't know why."
12:25;12:28;"I think I went to Yale once, and I was just like, ""Hmm."""
12:28;12:29;"- Yeah."
12:29;12:31;"- I think I went to Yale, and my first thought was,"
12:31;12:33;"""Connecticut's not really pulling its weight"
12:33;12:35;"in the tri-state area musical history."
12:35;12:36;"Not gonna go here."""
12:36;12:37;"- Fair point."
12:37;12:39;"- I think I applied to, like, seven or eight schools."
12:39;12:41;"Yeah, I think that's a thing that, over the years,"
12:41;12:43;"kids started applying to more and more schools."
12:43;12:44;"- Yeah."
12:44;12:45;"- Like, how many schools did you apply to?"
12:45;12:46;"- I think five."
12:46;12:48;"- And I guess you also applied to a lot of schools"
12:48;12:50;"'cause you want to see, like, who gives you the better deal."
12:50;12:51;"- Sure."
12:51;12:52;"- Financial aid and stuff like that."
12:52;12:55;"If I can remember, I applied to Princeton."
12:55;12:56;"- Damn, dude."
12:56;12:57;"- Oh, no, I applied to Harvard."
12:57;12:58;"- Look at you."
12:58;12:59;"- Yo, I didn't get in."
12:59;13:00;"I got wait-listed."
13:00;13:03;"I applied to Harvard, Princeton, Columbia Brown,"
13:03;13:05;"Wesleyan, Amherst."
13:05;13:06;"- Oh, CT."
13:06;13:07;"- Yeah, two CT schools."
13:07;13:09;"I might have applied to Vassar, actually,"
13:09;13:10;"now that I think about it,"
13:10;13:13;"and maybe NYU or something."
13:13;13:14;"- Top shelf."
13:14;13:15;"- Well, I think that's what--"
13:15;13:17;"- You did very well junior year."
13:17;13:19;"- I did well my junior year,"
13:19;13:21;"and then I got in everywhere"
13:21;13:23;"except for Princeton and Harvard."
13:23;13:24;"Thank God."
13:24;13:25;"- Wow, dude."
13:25;13:27;"- Honestly, it would have sucked going to those schools."
13:27;13:29;"I mean, even Columbia, borderline,"
13:29;13:30;"I sometimes look back on it,"
13:30;13:32;"and I'm like, ""Why did I care about, like,"
13:32;13:34;"going to, like, one of these dip-[bleep] Ivy League schools?"""
13:34;13:36;"I don't really have, like, pride in it."
13:36;13:37;"- Yeah."
13:37;13:39;"- I'm lucky that I met the right mix of people."
13:39;13:40;"There are so many whack people, too."
13:40;13:42;"It's like, I can't have pride about, like,"
13:42;13:44;"a school I went to for four years."
13:44;13:47;"I could have pride about, like, a region or something,"
13:47;13:48;"but the--"
13:48;13:50;"- I've never understood that people are, like,"
13:50;13:53;"super fired up to be alumni"
13:53;13:54;"or, like, super involved in, like,"
13:54;13:56;"the alumni organizations of a school."
13:56;13:57;"I never--"
13:57;13:58;"- I could understand it if, like,"
13:58;14:03;"if only to maybe help give access to the school"
14:03;14:04;"to underprivileged people."
14:04;14:06;"I could understand if there's, like, a social element"
14:06;14:07;"where you're kind of like, ""Listen,"
14:07;14:08;"this school changed my whole life,"
14:08;14:11;"and I want to make sure that people like me get--"""
14:11;14:12;"You know, like, that kind of story?"
14:12;14:13;"- Sure."
14:13;14:14;"- Is kind of, like, heartwarming,"
14:14;14:16;"but versus just that pure pride?"
14:16;14:17;"- Yeah."
14:17;14:18;"- I'm just like--"
14:18;14:19;"It's like, ""What the hell?"""
14:19;14:20;"So at the end of the day, for me,"
14:20;14:23;"it really came down to Columbia versus Brown."

16:43;16:49;"This episode's being like real podcast."
16:49;16:52;"Just kind of like actual biographical story,"
16:52;16:54;"which is good because I don't think we do that much."
16:54;16:57;"A little boring, but also just kind of giving some of those details."
16:57;17:02;"I was actually thinking about that recently because I've been reading Phil Lesch's autobiography."
17:02;17:03;"Nice."
17:03;17:07;"I really thought my appetite for Grateful Dead books would be quelled by now."
17:07;17:08;"Turns out it's insatiable."
17:08;17:10;"Turns out it's insatiable."
17:10;17:13;"Although there is a part of it that's like with some of these things,"
17:13;17:16;"by the time that Phil Lesch gets to describing Ultimont,"
17:16;17:21;"and he's even just being like, ""Ultimont was the ultimate comedown for the 1960s after Woodstock."""
17:21;17:23;"I'm just like, ""Okay, all right."""
17:23;17:26;"I've heard this literally a thousand times in my life."
17:26;17:31;"But then the parts I love is just him talking about the kind of boring early life."
17:31;17:36;"Then I changed high schools, and my parents moved from Oakland to Berkeley,"
17:36;17:39;"and then I started going to a local community college,"
17:39;17:42;"and then on the weekends I started going down to Palo Alto."
17:42;17:43;"I like those kind of details."
17:43;17:48;"So there's a part of me that as I read that stuff, even when he says stuff that's like--"
17:48;17:51;"If I was writing a book, I'd be like, ""Why are you putting this in?"""
17:51;17:55;"Where he's just telling-- And on our first trip to New York we did this, and then we did this,"
17:55;17:58;"and then we actually saw Frank Zappa perform."
17:58;18:02;"And I got to say, when I saw him play, it doesn't really help tell the story of his life,"
18:02;18:05;"and yet you're like, ""That is the good sh*t."""
18:05;18:06;"That's interesting detail."
18:06;18:11;"And also it's good just to have on record, at least for dudes like us,"
18:11;18:17;"I do kind of want to know that Phil and Jerry sat and watched Frank Zappa play in 1966"
18:17;18:19;"when they first went to New York or whatever."
18:19;18:20;"Yeah, that's gold."
18:20;18:27;"Anyway, I guess I'm saying this internet radio podcast will have just some of those real dry details."
18:27;18:32;"Guys, strap in. This is going to be a very boring, very dry episode."
18:32;18:34;"Because the truth is, if I think about--"
18:34;18:39;"Well, again, I don't want to assume that all TC heads are VW heads, because as we know, that's not true."
18:39;18:42;"But I'm interested in maybe where people applied to college,"
18:42;18:44;"or if they didn't go to college, or if they didn't apply."
18:44;18:45;"I'm interested in the backstory."
18:45;18:49;"But also like you, obviously as I'm saying this, it was fairly thoughtless."
18:49;18:53;"I was like, ""These are good schools that are not too far away."""
18:53;18:56;"And then at the end, I was like, ""Brown versus Columbia, they both seem pretty good."""
18:56;18:59;"You go take a tour of these schools, and you're just kind of like,"
18:59;19:02;"""Just like dumb sh*t that they're showing you. Oh, and this is the pool."""
19:02;19:04;"It's like, ""Oh, how does that work?"""
19:04;19:07;"And it's like, ""Well, if you're a student, you just roll up with your ID. You can swim all the time."""
19:07;19:09;"And guess what? It's open until 9."
19:09;19:13;"Whereas the actual real choice is between Providence and New York City."
19:13;19:14;"Yes."
19:14;19:15;"That's the real choice you're making."
19:15;19:16;"And thank God I figured that out."
19:16;19:17;"Yeah."
19:17;19:19;"Because I remember at the time being like,"
19:19;19:21;"""And again, I don't even know what the f*ck I was talking about."""
19:21;19:23;"I'd be like, ""Well, what are you interested in?"""
19:23;19:24;"""I guess I'm interested in music."""
19:24;19:29;"""Well, New York obviously has a lot going on with music, but does Providence have a scene?"""
19:29;19:32;"I'm like, ""Yeah, I don't know. My friend told me about this band called Lightning Bolt."""
19:32;19:34;"Yeah, man. Fort Thunder."
19:34;19:37;"And I'm just like, ""What the f*ck am I even talking about?"""
19:37;19:39;"Just the idea that that..."
19:39;19:40;"Right."
19:40;19:42;"I don't know. Maybe it is a big deal."
19:42;19:45;"Maybe there is somebody who went to Brown and they saw a show at Fort Thunder"
19:45;19:48;"and they got in the Lightning Bolt and that changed the course of their life."
19:48;19:49;"I don't know."
19:49;19:51;"I'm sure there is someone like that."
19:51;19:53;"But even the fact that I was in New York, I went to shows,"
19:53;19:56;"it really is just that I met people that I started a band with."
19:56;19:57;"That's the important part."
19:57;20:00;"The fact that I was in New York and saw..."
20:00;20:03;"I'm sure I saw some noise shows with some of my friends too."
20:03;20:05;"I could have seen that in Providence. I could have seen that in Boston."
20:05;20:07;"Bands go on tour, you know?"
20:07;20:12;"The scene already was kind of lacking importance then."
20:12;20:15;"The first thing that a band does is start to travel a little bit,"
20:15;20:18;"even if it's just locally, up and down the East Coast."
20:18;20:21;"Yeah, so then I think at some point I was like, ""Yeah, I think I'd rather be in New York."""
20:21;20:23;"And then I just ended up there."
20:23;20:27;"And then I think when I applied, you fill out, ""What are you interested in majoring in?"""
20:27;20:29;"And I liked biology and I got good grades in biology,"
20:29;20:31;"so I put evolutionary biology."
20:31;20:32;"Damn."
20:32;20:36;"As soon as I got there, I was just like, ""Uh, I don't know."""
20:36;20:41;"You just take random classes like film, intro to film."
20:41;20:42;"I like movies."
20:42;20:43;"College, dude."
20:43;20:44;"Yeah."
20:44;20:47;"Took an economics class and I was like, ""This is interesting,"
20:47;20:50;"but also kind of like a pain in the ass doing your homework."
20:50;20:51;"It's kind of annoying."""
20:51;20:53;"For some reason, I minored in economics."
20:53;20:54;"I didn't know that."
20:54;20:56;"See, we're getting into some real sh*t on this one."
20:56;20:58;"Jake with the econ minor."
20:58;21:03;"Microeconomics, macroeconomics, environmental economics."
21:03;21:04;"Baskets."
21:04;21:06;"Baskets of goods."
22:40;22:45;"Yeah, that's a truly pointless field of study because--"
22:45;22:47;"It's not even a science."
22:47;22:49;"Well, yeah, it's just a bunch of theories."
22:49;22:50;"It's like evolution."
22:50;22:54;"I don't remember anything about it."
22:54;22:56;"I don't know why I did that."
22:56;22:58;"Maybe because I was like being an art major and I was like,"
22:58;23:02;"""I got to balance that with something 'practical',"""
23:02;23:04;"having no idea what that means."
23:04;23:05;"That's a classic."
23:05;23:09;"And also, you minored."
23:09;23:12;"Just to minor in something is so--"
23:12;23:13;"Truly pointless."
23:13;23:16;"I've been thinking so much post the college scandal"
23:16;23:19;"how college is just so pointless."
23:19;23:21;"I don't want to say that because obviously there's certain things"
23:21;23:22;"you need training for,"
23:22;23:25;"but I feel like one of the defining characteristics of our generation"
23:25;23:29;"is that so many people were told they needed to go to college"
23:29;23:31;"and then graduated significantly in debt."
23:31;23:32;"Right."
23:32;23:35;"And there's a lot of people really questioning was it worth it."
23:35;23:37;"And either by the time you get out of debt, so much time has passed"
23:37;23:39;"that you're kind of like, ""What the f--- was that?"""
23:39;23:44;"Or you just were sold this idea that it's worth going into debt"
23:44;23:46;"so that you can study and enrich."
23:46;23:48;"There's a lot of reasons that people are already questioning that,"
23:48;23:51;"and I think exactly when that college scandal hit"
23:51;23:54;"about people just paying their way into college,"
23:54;23:56;"it was the perfect moment for people just to be like,"
23:56;23:57;"""Man, what the f--- is this?"""
23:57;24:00;"To truly on a large scale question the whole institution."
24:00;24:02;"Yeah, throw up their hands."
24:02;24:04;"Yeah, when I think about the future, it's like,"
24:04;24:08;"in 20 years, will as many kids be going to college?"
24:08;24:09;"It might take on--"
24:09;24:11;"Not if the prices keep going the way they're going."
24:11;24:13;"Yeah, the price is not right."
24:13;24:16;"Plus, you've got internet, a full repository of all information"
24:16;24:18;"anytime you want to know something."
24:18;24:20;"Oh, internet, that's a portmanteau."
24:20;24:23;"Oh, right, an international Netscape."
24:23;24:26;"Yeah, you watch Info Wars and you take classes at University of Phoenix."
24:26;24:28;"I mean, you're going to be golden."
24:28;24:30;"Internet is a portmanteau for internet network."
24:30;24:33;"Seinfeld, what's the next question? Let's move on."
24:33;24:37;"All right. Gosh, so many good ones."
24:37;24:39;"I mean, maybe just for the sake of continuity,"
24:39;24:41;"now we've heard both of your backgrounds,"
24:41;24:44;"how did Jake and Ezra become friends?"
24:44;24:46;"I feel like we've covered this on the show."
24:46;24:47;"In detail."
24:47;24:48;"All right, we can move on."
24:48;24:50;"Well, we can give the quick answer."
24:50;24:53;"The quick answer is I met Dave, Jake's brother,"
24:53;24:56;"because I was in a noise band at Columbia."
24:56;24:59;"I played sax in a noise band called Total War,"
24:59;25:04;"and somehow they knew Dave, and they got a gig opening for Dave"
25:04;25:06;"on some little tour in the summer."
25:06;25:08;"Did you guys play Zebulon?"
25:08;25:11;"I don't remember playing Zebulon."
25:11;25:16;"We toured with Dave at weird kind of Midwestern art collective type spaces and stuff."
25:16;25:17;"So Total War."
25:17;25:18;"Total War."
25:18;25:19;"With you on sax."
25:19;25:22;"With me on sax, opened for Dave, who was performing solo as Dirty Projectors."
25:22;25:24;"So this was like '04?"
25:24;25:27;"Yeah, I think it was probably literally summer of '04."
25:27;25:31;"So I got to know Dave a little bit on that tour, and then we stayed in touch."
25:31;25:36;"Then the next summer, Dave asked, ""Did I want to play saxophone in his band, Dirty Projectors?"""
25:36;25:39;"because he was putting together a big band, and there's some saxophone parts."
25:39;25:42;"So I said, ""Sure,"" and then I went on tour with Dave."
25:42;25:48;"I did two tours with Dirty Projectors, but either way, one of them, Jake was also in the band."
25:48;25:50;"At that point, you had just graduated from art school."
25:50;25:52;"2005."
25:52;25:55;"And you were kind of like just wanted to kill a few weeks."
25:55;25:56;"I was 28."
25:56;25:59;"And you jumped on the road, and you were playing a little guitar"
25:59;26:01;"and helping with some electronic stuff."
26:01;26:03;"You were helping trigger a bass drum sound."
26:03;26:05;"Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that."
26:05;26:07;"I should have just played guitar."
26:07;26:09;"I was also driving a lot."
26:09;26:11;"I was just sort of there for--"
26:11;26:12;"Just helping out on the tour."
26:12;26:13;"--kind of vibes."
26:13;26:18;"So I remember being at a rehearsal and then being introduced and being like,"
26:18;26:20;"""Oh, this is Dave's brother, Jake."""
26:20;26:22;"Then we went on tour, and the rest is history."
26:22;26:23;"Fast friends."
26:24;26:27;"I remember Dave being like, ""Dude, you're going to love Ezra."
26:27;26:28;"This guy's classic."""

34:29;34:31;"It's, like, real goofy."
34:31;34:33;"But I think in the back of my head, I felt like,"
34:33;34:36;"well, we could transition into something more serious, maybe."
34:36;34:38;"But I like the idea of, like, this, like,"
34:38;34:42;"goofy little funky song found, like, uh--"
34:42;34:43;"I think it was built around, like,"
34:43;34:45;"a Yellow Magic Orchestra sample."

34:47;34:49;"but in the--around 2003,"
34:49;34:51;"there was something somewhat novel"
34:51;34:54;"about making a rap song about pizza."
34:54;34:56;"I know it's, like, so played out now."
34:56;34:57;"You know, it's, like, the same way--"
34:57;34:59;"you remember how, like, in our lifetimes,"
34:59;35:02;"being into bacon kind of came and went?"
35:02;35:04;"Like, there was almost something avant-garde"
35:04;35:07;"about being into bacon in, like, 2005?"
35:07;35:09;"- Like, Brooklyn restaurants?"
35:09;35:10;"- A little bit, and--"
35:10;35:12;"- Like, leaning heavy into bacon?"
35:12;35:15;"- Yeah, and now Donald Trump Jr. posts, like,"
35:15;35:16;"""Bacon is good."""
35:16;35:17;"- [laughs]"
35:17;35:18;"You know, I'm just saying, like,"
35:18;35:19;"these things come and go,"
35:19;35:23;"so being into pizza is, like, just so boring."
35:23;35:24;"It's, like--it's almost like"
35:24;35:26;"an ""Iken has cheeseburger"" cat meme."
35:26;35:29;"But I promise you, there was--"
35:29;35:32;"there was just a touch of novelty about it back then."
35:32;35:33;"So the idea of making a rap song"
35:33;35:36;"about pizza seemed vaguely fresh."
35:36;35:37;"[laughs]"
35:37;35:39;"So anyway, I just had this idea"
35:39;35:40;"to make, like, kind of, like,"
35:40;35:43;"a goofy rap song about pizza, so--"
35:43;35:44;"And truly, there was something about, like,"
35:44;35:46;"trying to rap and write--"
35:46;35:49;"just got my brain working about lyrics in a way."

36:03;36:05;"We made a recording of it."
36:05;36:06;"And then I just remember listening,"
36:06;36:08;"thinking about it one day."
36:08;36:09;"I was taking a nap or something,"
36:09;36:11;"and I kind of woke up from the nap,"

36:22;36:23;"Uh-huh."
36:23;36:24;"P-R--and then I realized--"
36:24;36:26;"and then I kind of lost enthusiasm for it"
36:26;36:28;"when I realized my error."
36:28;36:29;"In the whole band?"
36:29;36:30;"A little bit."
36:30;36:31;"Well, when you were young,"
36:31;36:33;"you kind of cycled through bands quickly."
36:33;36:34;"Yeah, it's like--"
36:34;36:35;"You were in Total War,"
36:35;36:36;"you were in--what was the band named?"
36:36;36:37;"La Homme?"
36:37;36:38;"La Homme Run, yeah, it's, like, French."
36:38;36:39;"La Homme."
36:39;36:40;"What other bands were you in?"
36:40;36:42;"I remember there's one performance"
36:42;36:45;"of my kind of a Fairport Convention-style"
36:45;36:46;"British folk group"
36:46;36:48;"that was called Ezra and the Thames."
36:48;36:50;"I didn't have time to think of a good name,"
36:50;36:51;"so Ezra and the Thames."
36:51;36:53;"And I think we performed a couple,"
36:53;36:56;"like, Irish folk songs in a basement in Brooklyn,"
36:56;36:58;"and we definitely did Matty Groves,"
36:58;37:00;"like a Fairport Convention-style--"
37:00;37:01;"Was there a drummer?"
37:01;37:03;"Maybe, like, a dude on a snare drum"
37:03;37:04;"'cause we were just, like, rehearsing"
37:04;37:06;"in, like, dorm rooms and stuff."
37:06;37:09;"I remember you playing me a Steelye Span song."
37:09;37:11;"Oh, yeah, I was so into Steelye Span."
37:11;37:14;"Maybe in that 2005 minivan tour."
37:14;37:15;"Yeah, 'cause I've been obsessed"
37:15;37:17;"with Steelye Span since my sophomore year"
37:17;37:18;"of high school,"
37:18;37:21;"where my mom randomly had a Steelye Span CD"
37:21;37:22;"somebody gave her as a gift."
37:22;37:23;"Yeah."
37:23;37:24;"For people who don't know,"

45:45;45:48;"just like, 'This is a serious album,'"
45:48;45:49;"then, like, you know, that's kind of lame."""
45:49;45:51;"'Cause to me, all the albums have, like,"
45:51;45:53;"a mix of emotions or whatever."
45:53;45:54;"So at the end of the day,"
45:54;45:56;"I do think the song rating grew,"
45:56;45:59;"and we tightened stuff up on every record,"
45:59;46:01;"and definitely there's always hit new territory."
46:01;46:04;"But in terms of the pure, like, lightning bolt"
46:04;46:07;"of kind of, like, fresh ideas of youth,"
46:07;46:08;"I don't think we're ever gonna beat"
46:08;46:10;"the first album in a way."
46:10;46:11;"And again, that doesn't mean, like,"
46:11;46:13;"I expect that, like, people who are growing up too"
46:13;46:15;"are gonna want to, you know,"
46:15;46:17;"dance around to A-Punk every single day."
46:17;46:18;"But, like, if I'm honest,"
46:18;46:20;"I think I've written, like, richer songs"
46:20;46:22;"as I've gotten older."
46:22;46:24;"I think my song writing and lyrics have gotten better."
46:24;46:26;"I think our production has gotten"
46:26;46:28;"more tasteful over the years."
46:28;46:29;"I think there's a lot of ways"
46:29;46:31;"in which we've moved forward."
46:31;46:33;"But at the end of the day, just, like,"
46:33;46:36;"that sheer, like, youthful,"
46:36;46:38;"fresh stupidity of just, like,"
46:38;46:39;"picking up a guitar and going"
46:39;46:41;"♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪"
46:41;46:42;"Like, there's a reason why"
46:42;46:44;"that song still, like, pops up"
46:44;46:46;"and, like, goofy memes"
46:46;46:48;"and, like, a bunch of, like, knuckleheads"
46:48;46:50;"are, like, dancing to it on TikTok"
46:50;46:51;"doing a silly dance."
46:51;46:52;"So some people might assume"
46:52;46:53;"that I might think, ""Oh, yeah,"
46:53;46:54;"that's, like, one of our biggest songs,"
46:54;46:56;"but that's just, like, this annoying young song."""
46:56;46:58;"And my real, you know, my real sh--"
46:58;47:00;"as a songwriter is, like, a song like"
47:00;47:01;"""Unbearably White"" or ""Hannah Hunt."""
47:01;47:03;"You know, those are, like, pretty,"
47:03;47:05;"to me, like, the A-punk guitar riff,"
47:05;47:07;"that's more like a once-a-decade idea"
47:07;47:08;"that you get."
47:08;47:09;"And I know it sounds so stupid"
47:09;47:11;"because it's so simple,"
47:11;47:12;"but there's actually, to me,"
47:12;47:14;"more precedent for a lot"
47:14;47:15;"of the more beautiful"
47:15;47:17;"Vampire Weekend songs."
47:17;47:18;"And in a funny way, like,"
47:18;47:21;"a song like A-punk or Oxford Comma,"
47:21;47:22;"to me, those are truly, like,"
47:22;47:24;"the slightly out-of-nowhere songs."
47:24;47:26;"And I know people might hear it differently"
47:26;47:27;"and they'd be like, ""Well, A-punk"
47:27;47:28;"sounds like this,"""
47:28;47:29;"or ""Oxford Comma sounds like that."""
47:29;47:30;"But I just know that that's, like--"
47:30;47:31;"I consider those as, like,"
47:31;47:33;"weird lightning bolt ideas"
47:33;47:34;"So anyway, I look back"
47:34;47:35;"on the first album,"
47:35;47:37;"and to me, especially when I still play"
47:37;47:39;"those songs live or something,"
47:39;47:40;"there always will be, like,"
47:40;47:42;"a freshness about it."
47:42;47:43;"So there is some type"
47:43;47:44;"of, like, energy in it,"
47:44;47:46;"and I still look for that energy."
47:46;47:47;"I'm always looking for ideas"
47:47;47:49;"that I find fresh or exciting"
47:49;47:50;"on every album."
47:50;47:51;"And I'm not even saying"
47:51;47:53;"the first album's my favorite,"
47:53;47:54;"but again, there's--"
47:54;47:55;"the question--well, the question"
47:55;47:56;"has something to do with energy."
47:56;47:57;"There's something about that,"
47:57;47:59;"that youthful, first, like,"

57:09;57:11;"Also, what about the fact that just--"
57:11;57:12;"I think one of the biggest factors"
57:12;57:15;"is just that people eat less carbs now."
57:15;57:16;"Carbs have been dragged"

57:42;57:43;"A glass of red wine"
57:43;57:45;"and some sugary cereal milk."
57:45;57:46;"I think carbs got played out"

57:47;57:48;"Yeah."

01:32:48;01:32:55;"Well, when I was little, my nickname in the family was Ezzy. E-Z-Z-I. So for instance,"
01:32:55;01:33:03;"I had some wood blocks with the letters E-Z-Z-I. So Ezzy, Ezzy boy, things like that. And then"
01:33:03;01:33:07;"of course people always called me Ez. And I can think of random nicknames I got over"
01:33:07;01:33:11;"the years like, I remember I went to some kind of summer camp thing once where there"
01:33:11;01:33:17;"was this kid that I met who always called me RZA. So I got like the hip hop nicknames"
01:33:17;01:33:23;"RZA, somebody called me Rahim. But yeah, Ez is the classic. But Ezzy is cute I think"
01:33:23;01:33:27;"for a little kid. Hey Ezzy. I think that just comes naturally, right?"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Oh yeah."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Alright, let's get a couple more, Seinfeld."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Alright, um."
01:33:32;01:33:36;"What are your feelings on the iconic Canadian prog rock band Rush?"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"Oh, there you go."
01:33:37;01:33:42;"There were some good songs. Zeppelin without any blues."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"That's how you describe Rush?"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"I guess, I don't know."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"But they're like prog-ier?"
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Yeah."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"I don't know that many songs. I mean, I know Tom Sawyer."
01:33:49;01:33:55;"I'm not the day warrior, mean, mean stride. Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride."
01:34:07;01:34:12;"Love is mine, it's not for rent. Don't put him down, he's arrogant."
01:34:12;01:34:18;"He's reserved, quiet defense. Lighting out the day's events."
01:34:18;01:34:20;"The river."
01:34:36;01:34:41;"What do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?"
01:34:41;01:34:47;"Catch the mist, catch the myth. Catch the mystery, catch the thrift."
01:34:55;01:35:08;"The world is, the world is love and life are deep. Maybe as the skies are wide."
01:35:12;01:35:18;"The space Tom Sawyer he gets high on you. And the space he invades he gets by on you."
01:35:18;01:35:23;"Ezra, can you describe your fast food preferences/habits while on tour?"
01:35:23;01:35:27;"Well, on tour I try to keep it healthy. So I don't actually eat that much fast food on tour."
01:35:27;01:35:32;"That would be like a treat to maybe hit a Taco Bell or a McDonald's or something."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"On tour I try to, you know, eat like boring food."
01:35:36;01:35:41;"Like steamed vegetables and chicken breast, a salad, things like that."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Dried mango for a sweet treat."
01:35:43;01:35:47;"Alright, Phil Collins is going on tour right now and the title of the tour is"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"""Phil Collins Still Not Dead Yet Tour""."
01:35:50;01:35:57;"In 40 years time when VW and Richard Pictures tours, what will your respective tours be called?"
01:35:57;01:36:00;"Well, our current tour is called the Promise Land Tour."
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Because you're playing Promise Land every set?"
01:36:02;01:36:07;"We are. That's our new big, well, that's one of many set additions."
01:36:07;01:36:13;"That's funny because I was thinking about that because when we had to like, you know, make some ads and stuff."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Like, well, what are you calling the tour this year?"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"And I was like, I think if we call it anything other than the Father of the Bride Tour, it's confusing."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"Sure."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Like we just put out Father of the Bride and we're just like,"
01:36:23;01:36:26;"Ride the Lightning Tour? Like, what would you call it?"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"I guess you could call it something a tour."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"Like you could reference one. You could call it the Harmony Hall Tour."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"That seems weird too."
01:36:33;01:36:37;"Or like Summer 2019, the 2021 Tour."
01:36:37;01:36:44;"Have you guys had creative names for previous tours or has it always been named after the album?"
01:36:44;01:36:49;"I don't think so. I think it makes sense to come up with a creative name for a tour if it's like a special bill."
01:36:49;01:36:54;"Like if we ever do a proper tour of Vampire Week and Richard Pictures kind of like on like some random summer,"
01:36:54;01:36:58;"we could call that just like Rippin' and Dippin', the Rip and Dip Tour."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"That'd be tight, dude."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"Pictures of vampires."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Do like a 10-city run."
01:37:03;01:37:04;"10-city run?"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Vampire, Richard."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"It could be fun."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"That could be great."
01:37:08;01:37:11;"So something like that maybe deserves a special name or just like,"
01:37:11;01:37:16;"I feel like there are a lot of tours where people refer to themselves as like gods."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Gods?"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Or like lords. Lords of summer."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Jesus."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"Gods of the stage."
01:37:22;01:37:26;"Like, I mean, where it's like a special bill."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"My favorite lyric."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"James Taylor and Phil Collins."
01:37:28;01:37:34;"My favorite lyric in Promised Land is ""Working on a T-bone steak a la Carde, flying to the Golden State."""
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Carde?"
01:37:35;01:37:36;"He says Carde, yeah."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Like a la carte."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Like Cardi B."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"Exactly."
01:37:40;01:37:46;"Chuck Berry is on an airplane eating a T-bone steak on the airplane."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"He's flying into L.A."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"All that a la carte really means is just by itself."
01:37:51;01:37:55;"Yeah, so he's just eating a -- there's no side of broccoli and mashed potatoes."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"It's just T-bone steak on like a plate."
01:37:58;01:38:01;"And Mr. Berry, are you sure you don't want any vegetables or potatoes with that?"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"No thanks."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"A la carte, please."
01:38:05;01:38:10;"I know I referenced it on a previous episode, but we're going to Norfolk, Virginia for the first time."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"And I was saying how probably people play that song all the time there."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Sure."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"And it wouldn't even make that much sense."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"That's actually a song you should play when you're in California."
01:38:16;01:38:19;"Yeah, it's about chasing your dreams."
01:38:19;01:38:22;"That's actually a disrespectful song to play in Norfolk, Virginia"
01:38:22;01:38:28;"because the whole premise of the song implies that Norfolk, Virginia is decidedly not the promised land."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Exactly."
01:38:29;01:38:36;"Maybe if I really thoughtfully changed the lyrics, I'm like, ""Norfolk, I know you probably know that Chuck Berry song,"
01:38:36;01:38:40;"'Promised Land,' also popularized by Grateful Dead and Richard Pictures."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"But why do people always have to say that Norfolk, Virginia is not the promised land?"""
01:38:43;01:38:45;"And then I'd fully flip the lyrics."
01:38:45;01:38:46;"You do reverse."
01:38:46;01:38:51;"I left my home in L.A., California, got Virginia on my mind."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"All right, we're off to the races."
01:38:53;01:38:56;"The Greyhound breaks down in Albuquerque."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"Still works."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"You catch that train over to Houston."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"Yep."
01:39:00;01:39:06;"Then you get on that flight, working on that T-bone steak, heading into Ronald Reagan Airport."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"Is that in D.C.?"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"That's in D.C."
01:39:09;01:39:10;"Okay, yeah."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"That's perfect."
01:39:11;01:39:12;"Then you drive to Norfolk."
01:39:12;01:39:18;"I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California, on my mind."
01:39:18;01:39:24;"Satellite, Greyhound, and roadie pass, Raleigh, and all across Carolina."
01:39:24;01:39:30;"All stopping, charging, bypassing, rocking, and we never was meeting late."
01:39:30;01:39:36;"It was 90 miles out of Atlanta by sundown, road crossing, turning state."
01:39:36;01:39:42;"You had more trouble than turned into a strut, and that way crossed out of bounds."
01:39:42;01:39:47;"The Greyhound broke down and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham."
01:40:59;01:41:05;"Alright, someone's asking, ""Have you seen this Mike Love Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech?"""
01:41:05;01:41:06;"And what are your thoughts?"
01:41:06;01:41:14;"We've been emailed, and people have referenced this, I guess, infamous Mike Love Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech."
01:41:14;01:41:20;"I don't know exactly what he said, but Mike Love, I guess, has always been known as one of the loose cannons of the Beach Boys."
01:41:20;01:41:25;"So let's check out what Mike Love had to say when the Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"(applause)"
01:41:28;01:41:31;"So a bunch of the Beach Boys take the stage."
01:41:31;01:41:35;"(applause)"
01:41:35;01:41:39;"Mike Love wearing his, uh, seems like he's in a fun mood."
01:41:39;01:41:42;"He's wearing one of his classic baseball caps."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"This is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Yeah."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"When did that open?"
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Thank you, Elton, for that wonderful induction."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"(applause)"
01:41:51;01:41:57;"27 years ago, over a summer weekend in 1961, my cousin Mike Love and I got a bright idea."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"We were going to write a song."
01:41:59;01:42:02;"My parents were going away, and they left us some money for food."
01:42:02;01:42:05;"As soon as they split, we went to the music shop and--"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Oh, this is Brian Wilson reading."
01:42:07;01:42:13;"By Sunday night, when my folks came home, we were very hungry, and we had written a tune called ""Surfin'."""
01:42:13;01:42:21;"Who could have known then that 27 years and 52 albums later, we would be standing before you receiving this very great honor?"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"52 albums?"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"We're very proud and very grateful."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"What did he say?"
01:42:24;01:42:27;"I only wish that my younger brother Dennis could be here at our side tonight."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"We miss him very much."
01:42:29;01:42:35;"By the way, folks, Dennis Wilson's Pacific Ocean Blue album from 1979, gold."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"Check it out."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Highly rec."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Last year, when I was asked to induct Lieber and Stoller into the Hall of Fame--"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"Okay, so let's find Mike-- when Mike Love gets on the mic."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"Mike, how are you?"
01:42:43;01:42:50;"You heard from Cousin Brian the reason why we started making music, and the reason that keeps us going."
01:42:50;01:42:54;"And it sounds corny, but you can hear it in the harmonies."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Those of you who are musicians."
01:42:56;01:43:01;"And the reason why people like the Beach Boys is because we love harmony."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"We love music, and we love harmony."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"And we love all people, too."
01:43:06;01:43:13;"When I went to school, high school, my cousin Brian and I would jump over the fence, ditch class, we'd go surfing."
01:43:13;01:43:18;"Now, we couldn't surf very good, but it was a whole lifestyle thing."
01:43:18;01:43:23;"We would listen to the music, the R&B music at the time."
01:43:23;01:43:31;"And some of our favorite records were the doo-wop type of deals, and there you go again with harmony."
01:43:31;01:43:39;"And I think it's wonderful to be here tonight, but I also think it's sad that there are other people who aren't here tonight."
01:43:39;01:43:43;"And those are the people who have passed away."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"Those are the obvious ones."
01:43:45;01:43:55;"But the other not-so-obvious ones are people like Paul McCartney, who couldn't be here tonight because he's in a lawsuit with Ringo and Yoko."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"[cheers]"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Okay."
01:43:58;01:44:05;"That's why he sent a telegram to some high-priced attorney in this room."
01:44:05;01:44:09;"Now, that's a bummer, because we're talking about harmony, right, in the world?"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"It's a bummer, man."
01:44:10;01:44:15;"We can't get it together in America and in England, and harmony within our groups."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"I mean, believe it."
01:44:16;01:44:21;"You can believe it, the Beach Boys have their own intersticine or whatever you call it, squabbles."
01:44:21;01:44:25;"But that's a bummer when Ms. Ross can't make it, you know?"
01:44:25;01:44:31;"Why does he care about the internal politics of the Beatles and the Supremes?"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"What's the point he's making?"
01:44:33;01:44:39;"The Beach Boys continue to do--we did about 180 performances last year."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Wow."
01:44:40;01:44:44;"I like to see the mop tops match that."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"What?"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"He's also freestyling them."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"They just cut to Julian Lettum."
01:44:49;01:44:57;"I'd like to see Mick Jagger get out on this stage and do ""I Get Around"" versus ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" any day now."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is a good song, Mike."
01:45:00;01:45:06;"Now, a lot of people are going to go out of this room tonight thinking that Mike Love is crazy."
01:45:06;01:45:10;"They've been saying that for years."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Ain't nothing new about that."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"What I'm talking about--"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Mike Love could have been president."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"--is forget this room."
01:45:16;01:45:19;"This stage is 6% of the population of the world."
01:45:19;01:45:23;"That's why I came here tonight with Muhammad Ali."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"Muhammad!"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Salam alaikum!"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Okay."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Did he just hammered?"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"He just threw up a black power fist."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"Damn."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"So Muhammad Ali was his plus one?"
01:45:38;01:45:39;"I guess."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Wait, wait, hold on."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Wait, Mike Love's all over the map."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"He had a scripted thing in the beginning."
01:45:44;01:45:52;"And he's starting to say that--he's also trying to think internationally and saying that Muhammad Ali represents something international via his faith."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"The U.S. is 6% of the world's population."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"That's why I came here tonight."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"That makes no sense."
01:45:58;01:46:04;"If everybody had an ocean across the USA"
01:46:04;01:46:10;"Then everybody'd be surfin' like California"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"You'd see 'em wearin' their baggies"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"Warrachi sandals, too"
01:46:16;01:46:19;"Bushy, bushy blonde hair, too"
01:46:19;01:46:22;"Surfin' USA"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"You'll catch 'em surfin' at Deb"
01:46:24;01:46:28;"Ventura County Line"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"Santa Cruz and Trent"
01:46:31;01:46:34;"Australia Caribbean"
01:46:34;01:46:37;"Oakland and Delhi"
01:46:37;01:46:40;"And Tahiti way inside, outside"
01:46:40;01:46:43;"Everybody's gonna surfin'"
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Surfin' USA"
01:46:46;01:46:49;"I didn't hear you say ""Aleykum Salam."""
01:46:49;01:46:52;"""Aleykum Salam,"" he said it."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"All right."
01:46:53;01:46:56;"Okay, I don't care what anybody in this room thinks."
01:46:56;01:47:02;"You know when they were talking about this guy with the guitar?"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"You know, Arlo's father?"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"Woody Guthrie, yeah."
01:47:07;01:47:11;"Well, I knew that because my father used to sing some of those songs."
01:47:11;01:47:15;"And my mother, the Wilson, Emily Wilson,"
01:47:15;01:47:19;"I'm first cousin with Brian, Carl, and the late Dennis,"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"the surfer of the group."
01:47:21;01:47:26;"When they first came to California, they were Kansas Dust Bowl Swedes."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"All right? Swedish people."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"Who didn't have enough money to rent or buy a house,"
01:47:31;01:47:34;"they lived in tents on the beach in Huntington Beach, California"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"when they first came out."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"All right?"
01:47:37;01:47:43;"And now we're sitting in this room with all this glitterati of the glissando."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"All six percent of us."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"Glitterati, portmanteau. Yeah, nice."
01:47:47;01:47:52;"And we're fighting intersticene, squabbles, you know, messing around."
01:47:52;01:47:55;"What I want to say is that this whole room"
01:47:55;01:48:00;"recognizes that there is one earth here."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"And I want us to do something fantastic with all this talent."
01:48:03;01:48:06;"And all this wonderful spirit and soul."
01:48:06;01:48:09;"And I'd like to see some people kick out the jams."
01:48:09;01:48:13;"And I challenge the boss to get up on stage and jam."
01:48:13;01:48:14;"Oh, tight."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"Is Springsteen there?"
01:48:16;01:48:20;"I guess so."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Some G-Funk sense?"
01:48:21;01:48:25;"I want to see Billy Joel, see if he can still tickle Ivory's."
01:48:25;01:48:27;"Let me see."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"I know Mick Jagger won't be here tonight."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"He's going to have to stay in England."
01:48:32;01:48:35;"But I'd like to see us in the Coliseum and him in the stadium."
01:48:35;01:48:40;"Because he's always been chicken sh*t to get on stage with the Beach Boys."
01:48:40;01:48:43;"Thank f*ck he didn't mention me."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"Elton John."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Okay."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"Okay, so."
01:48:46;01:48:52;"That's like the angriest call for global unity I've ever heard in my life."
01:48:52;01:48:58;"I thought that it was going to be more like angry, like taking down all his enemies."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"It's more just all over the place."
01:49:00;01:49:03;"Maybe he's got an actual problem with Mick Jagger or he thinks he's being funny."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"He's taking the piss out of him."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"Although he's all over the place, man."
01:49:07;01:49:15;"He's just like, ""We're 6% of the population, we came from nothing, and now we've got all these inter-scene squabbles."""
01:49:15;01:49:17;"What's the word? Inter-nessing?"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"It's very Trump to mess the word up."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"And not give a f*ck and say it multiple times."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"I mean, I respect that part of it."
01:49:23;01:49:28;"And then be like, ""You guys all suck, we all suck, why don't we be better to each other?"""
01:49:28;01:49:30;"But, God, Mick Jagger sucks."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"It's just like, what are you saying, dude?"
01:49:32;01:49:35;"And also, why did he pretend he doesn't know who Woody Guthrie is?"
01:49:35;01:49:41;"When the whole point of the story is to say that his parents had a similar background to Woody Guthrie."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"Who's the guy with the guitar? You know, Arlo?"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"Oh yeah, well I knew--"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Arlo's father."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Oh right, yeah, well I knew that."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Because my father sang his songs."
01:49:50;01:49:55;"Also, saying Mick Jagger's too chicken sh*t to get on stage with the Beach Boys is like--"
01:49:55;01:50:03;"In terms of an on-stage presence, I can't think of anything kind of lamer than the Beach Boys."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"The Stones, like, kicked ass."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"Yeah, I mean--"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"It's like, he's just--"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"What are you talking about, dude?"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"I mean, I could imagine--"
01:50:09;01:50:15;"Is this just like a lifetime of chips on his shoulder, building up to some weird thing where he's just like,"
01:50:15;01:50:18;"""We're better at harmonies than the Stones."""
01:50:18;01:50:19;"That's true."
01:50:19;01:50:25;"Is he just trying to say that Mick Jagger's too chicken sh*t to try to deal with our four-part harmonies?"
01:50:25;01:50:30;"That my cousin wrote, and I struggled to pull off my part."
01:50:30;01:50:36;"And he gave me the easiest parts to sing, because I'm the least talented in this group by a mile."
