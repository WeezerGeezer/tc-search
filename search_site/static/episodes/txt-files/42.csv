00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, May 7th."
00:05;00:09;"It's springtime in America."
00:09;00:15;"Jake and I talk about growing up baseball cards."
00:15;00:19;"Time Crisis, May 7th."
00:19;00:23;"It's springtime in America."
00:23;00:28;"Jake and I talk about growing up baseball cards."
00:28;00:38;"But we also think about people like Tom York, Chris Martin, and members of One Direction."
00:38;00:45;"This is a very special Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:45;00:48;"Beats 1."
00:49;00:54;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:54;01:02;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
01:02;01:09;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
01:09;01:16;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:16;01:20;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:20;01:26;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:26;01:31;"Leave me lonely babe."
01:31;01:35;"Time Crisis, May 7th, 2017."
01:35;01:40;"May 7th, people born on this day are drawn to a career by abstract circumstances."
01:40;01:44;"They do not have a specific plan for it, rather follow what they feel is a calling."
01:44;01:47;"These people are great at managing money."
01:47;01:50;"They also make good artists due to their natural creativity."
01:50;01:52;"Is that from the horoscope book?"
01:52;01:53;"Yeah, yeah."
01:53;01:56;"Almost every time I look at one of those horoscope books and I read my birthday, I'm like, ""Alright."""
01:56;01:57;"Yeah."
01:57;02:00;"And you go through and you look at other people's birthdays and you're like, ""Yeah."""
02:00;02:05;"If I remember correctly, February 3rd is exacting realism."
02:05;02:08;"Exacting realism? What does that mean?"
02:08;02:13;"It means brutal, straight down the line realism."
02:13;02:15;"It means you have a realistic outlook."
02:15;02:18;"I found that it fit me perfectly, eerily."
02:18;02:19;"February 3rd."
02:19;02:20;"So you're an Aquarian?"
02:20;02:21;"Aquarius."
02:21;02:22;"That makes you an Aquarian."
02:22;02:23;"Okay."
02:23;02:24;"I'm Arius."
02:24;02:25;"Does that make me an Arian?"
02:25;02:27;"I never heard of that before, but..."
02:27;02:31;"Well, I'm looking at a random website, or it's the first one that comes up when I googled"
02:31;02:33;"February 3rd analysis."
02:33;02:37;"If you were born on February 3rd, you have a way of seeing beyond the immediate issues"
02:37;02:37;"at hand."
02:37;02:40;"You are busy, but take time to smell the roses."
02:40;02:42;"Does that sound like you?"
02:42;02:45;"It does, but then again, who doesn't it sound like, right?"
02:45;02:47;"Well, that's a funny one."
02:47;02:49;"Everyone's like, ""I have a good perspective on life."""
02:49;02:49;"Right."
02:49;02:52;"You have a way of seeing beyond the immediate issues at hand."
02:52;02:57;"Who would look that up in the birthday book and be like, ""No, me, I'd never see beyond"
02:57;02:57;"the issues at hand."""
02:57;03:00;"I get stressed out about the most insignificant details."
03:00;03:01;"""I'm very myopic."
03:01;03:02;"I never..."""
03:02;03:04;"Maybe some people feel that way."
03:04;03:05;"What else does it say?"
03:05;03:10;"""Artistic, true, down to earth, and fascinating."""
03:10;03:10;"All right."
03:10;03:11;"I'm down to earth."
03:11;03:12;"Yeah."
03:12;03:13;"You're fascinating."
03:13;03:15;"You can be unconventional."
03:15;03:15;"That's nice."
03:15;03:17;"Yet may have conventional values."
03:17;03:18;"I think that's pretty straightforward."
03:18;03:20;"You put in the groundwork."
03:20;03:21;"Now it is time for the hard work to pay off."
03:21;03:22;"Wait, why is it?"
03:22;03:24;"Why is it like suddenly..."
03:24;03:26;"When does the hard work pay off?"
03:26;03:27;"Are you a devoted family member?"
03:27;03:30;"Okay, well, here's the negative parts."
03:30;03:32;"Aquarius."
03:32;03:34;"You find difficulty in dealing with other people's emotions."
03:34;03:37;"Wait, is this February 3rd specific or is this Aquarius?"
03:37;03:39;"I think now it's just getting into Aquarius."
03:39;03:42;"""Your friends think you are being hard or cold"
03:42;03:44;"when you choose not to chat about their problems."
03:44;03:47;"Nevertheless, your friends and family are supportive and devoted to you."""
03:47;03:49;"Does that happen a lot where someone's like,"
03:49;03:51;"""Jake, man, I'm going through some sh*t."""
03:51;03:53;"You're just like, ""You know what, Brad?"
03:53;03:55;"We're watching the game, man."
03:55;03:56;"Like, let's talk on Monday."""
03:56;03:58;"No, that's not my vibe at all."
03:58;04:00;"Been a rough few weeks, Jake."
04:00;04:01;"I mean, who doesn't have..."
04:01;04:01;"All right, all right."
04:01;04:02;"You want a beer?"
04:02;04:03;"Let's go to the bar."
04:03;04:06;"I love sitting down at a bar with a friend and just like hashing it out."
04:06;04:07;"Talking about life."
04:07;04:08;"Oh, yeah."
04:08;04:09;"Okay, maybe horoscopes aren't real."
04:09;04:13;"And who doesn't have problems dealing with other people's emotions?"
04:13;04:15;"I mean, that's tough."
04:15;04:15;"Right."
04:15;04:16;"What kind of psychopath would be..."
04:16;04:20;"Even if you're like a very empathic, kind person,"
04:20;04:23;"what kind of psychopath would see like..."
04:23;04:26;"Do you have problems dealing with other people's emotions?"
04:26;04:27;"Never."
04:27;04:27;"It's always easy."
04:27;04:29;"I'm great at it."
04:29;04:31;"That never causes problems."
04:31;04:32;"What's your birthday?"
04:32;04:33;"April 8th."
04:33;04:33;"You see what it says?"
04:33;04:34;"Yeah, yeah."
04:34;04:36;"Oh, yeah, the Cobain Day."
04:36;04:37;"Exactly."
04:37;04:38;"Cobain Day adjacent."
04:38;04:39;"April 8th."
04:39;04:40;"Analysis."
04:40;04:44;"If your birthday is on April 8th, you have a nose for business."
04:44;04:45;"Okay."
04:45;04:46;"Who could deny that?"
04:46;04:46;"You do."
04:46;04:48;"Vampire Weekend Incorporated."
04:48;04:52;"I'm the president of various LLCs and corporations."
04:52;04:53;"This radio show."
04:53;04:54;"That's right."
04:54;04:58;"Cross-platform synergistic branding opportunities."
04:58;04:58;"That's me."
04:58;05:00;"You're my boss, dude."
05:00;05:01;"That's right."
05:01;05:02;"Got various employees."
05:02;05:04;"I employ Aquarius."
05:04;05:06;"Oh, wait, it's funny."
05:06;05:10;"Your exceptional ability to be quick and sharp makes you a wanted Aryan."
05:10;05:12;"Oh, you are an Aryan."
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, well, it's spelled A-R-I-A-N."
05:15;05:19;"I always thought I was very un-Aryan, but I'm a wanted Aryan."
05:19;05:22;"You are first to show compassion for others and lend a helping hand."
05:22;05:23;"That's pretty on point."
05:23;05:26;"I mean, you're a busy guy, but honestly, if I called you at two in the morning and I was"
05:26;05:29;"like, ""Dude, I'm dealing with some heavy stuff right now."
05:29;05:33;"Can we meet at like the Denny's on Sunset and Gower?"
05:33;05:34;"I got to just talk this through."""
05:34;05:35;"I feel like you'd be there."
05:35;05:38;"Yeah, my phone would probably be on airplane mode a lot at night, but..."
05:38;05:39;"Okay."
05:39;05:40;"No, but if I got..."
05:40;05:42;"I mean, if I was pounding on your door at 3 a.m."
05:42;05:42;"Oh, if you're pounding on the..."
05:42;05:43;"Of course."
05:43;05:43;"No."
05:43;05:44;"You know, it'd be all good."
05:44;05:48;"And I'll be honest, when you described that scenario, getting like the 2 a.m. call from"
05:48;05:51;"you to meet at the Denny's on Sunset to talk about some..."
05:51;05:54;"My first thought was like, ""That sounds like an absolute pleasure."""
07:54;07:56;"We were having an interesting conversation before the show, Jake."
07:56;07:58;"About the Zeppelin reunion, or what are we talking about?"
07:58;08:05;"Well, first I wanted to talk about the fact that you used to be a very hardcore baseball card collector."
08:05;08:06;"That's true, I did."
08:06;08:08;"And we were kind of talking about..."
08:08;08:17;"I don't mean to make this gender specific, but at least when we were kids, the baseball card comic book scenes were primarily male."
08:17;08:19;"The dealers and the collectors."
08:19;08:27;"Well, the dealers and the collectors, and I'm sure there were a lot of female collectors who probably felt like weirded out by the fact every time they go to a store, it's like a 45-year-old."
08:27;08:29;"Dude in there."
08:29;08:37;"But we were talking about the specific and weird relationship that you have when you're like a 10, 11, 12-year-old boy."
08:37;08:38;"Yeah."
08:38;08:45;"And you go into these spaces where there's like the random dude that you have to deal with."
08:45;08:46;"Yeah."
08:46;08:53;"So to start, just paint a picture for people, because I don't even know if people buy baseball cards anymore today, like young kids."
08:53;08:57;"Yeah, or if they do, they might do it on the internet or like..."
08:57;09:01;"I think people buy cards, but I mean, I think cards..."
09:01;09:07;"So I was born in '77, so I was like, let's say I was like 12 and 89, 13 in 1990."
09:07;09:13;"And that was like, I think one of the first major crests of the baseball card market."
09:13;09:21;"It was a hot market, cards sold for a lot of money, old cards from the 60s and 70s were really expensive."
09:21;09:26;"New cards were really hot, like an 89 Upper Deck, Ken Griffey Jr. Rookie card."
09:26;09:35;"Like you might get in a pack, like if you bought a pack for $2, you might get a Ken Griffey Rookie card that was like 100 bucks, like worth 100 bucks."
09:35;09:37;"So that was like a big deal when you're 12."
09:37;09:41;"It was an intersection of sports fandom, object fetishism..."
09:41;09:43;"Yeah, memorabilia it's called."
09:43;09:45;"And young capitalism."
09:45;09:46;"Yep."
09:46;09:48;"All combining into just a toxic combo."
09:48;09:57;"And so yes, before the internet, so then you'd go to these like random crappy little stores that popped up in like every other strip mall around the United States."
09:57;10:05;"They set up overnight, there'd be like the glass cases, you know, it's like under the countertop with all the like individual cards, like the..."
10:05;10:07;"More valuable ones."
10:07;10:12;"Right, Mickey Mantle, Cal Ripken Jr. card, Rookie card, you know, like that kind of stuff."
10:12;10:23;"And like I'd go there with my mom, so my mom's like in her 40s taking her like 12 year old son to this like random strip mall to buy cards."
10:23;10:26;"And I, you know, and like my budget was severely limited."
10:26;10:27;"Right."
10:27;10:30;"It was just like, I don't know, I don't know how we got into this the other day, but..."
10:30;10:35;"It made me think, I wasn't really that into baseball cards, but I like going to the comic book store."
10:35;10:42;"And there's like a sim... Yeah, like I picture a very similar scenario, like my mom takes me there, there's like..."
10:42;10:45;"I can't even guess how old these guys would have been, for all I know they were like 25."
10:45;10:47;"Yeah, I know, they seem like they're 40, but..."
10:47;10:51;"And they're like kind of like weird old like Simpsons-esque comic book store guys."
10:51;10:52;"Yeah."
10:52;10:56;"And you'd have these like funny interactions, like..."
10:56;11:03;"You'd have like some question, you feel really nervous and just be like, ""Um, do you have the two issues ago?"""
11:03;11:05;"Punisher War Journal #3."
11:05;11:11;"Uncanny X-Men vs. Amazing X-Men."
11:11;11:13;"Guru the Wanderer."
11:13;11:17;"There's just something really funny about being that age and like..."
11:17;11:22;"Interacting with these like random older dudes."
11:22;11:27;"Maybe it's kind of lost to time, I don't know if that still exists, like..."
11:27;11:29;"Yeah, just going into some random strip mall."
11:29;11:31;"It would be like a great Netflix series."
11:31;11:34;"The baseball card guys are weirder than the comic book store guys."
11:34;11:39;"I feel like I understand... comic book store guys, they're just nerdy fans."
11:39;11:42;"And it kind of makes sense that they would..."
11:42;11:46;"Like, I don't know, that doesn't sound like such a bad job to me, it's like a slow day."
11:46;11:48;"You're just looking at all the new comics."
11:48;11:50;"Well, and the comics are like art."
11:50;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:52;"So there's something to appreciate."
11:52;12:01;"Sports memorabilia is just like photographs printed on 2.5x4 inch pieces of cardboard."
12:01;12:03;"Like, baseball cards suck."
12:03;12:05;"Right, like you could..."
12:05;12:07;"And I used to go to those baseball card fairs."
12:07;12:11;"Which is just so brutal, like, off-season."
12:11;12:15;"Like, winter in Connecticut circa 1990."
12:15;12:18;"There was a baseball card convention at the Sheridan."
12:18;12:20;"Off Interstate 84."
12:20;12:25;"A grey New England sky, bare trees in the parking lot of the Sheridan."
12:25;12:28;"Mom, there's a baseball card convention in two Saturdays."
12:28;12:32;"Can you take me to the Sheridan? It's really close."
12:32;12:35;"My mom, goodness of her heart, she takes me to this..."
12:35;12:39;"Like, 10am, going to the Sheridan."
12:39;12:42;"Roger Clemens is there."
12:42;12:45;"Sitting behind a folding table."
12:45;12:48;"Behind... those like velvet ropes, security..."
12:48;12:49;"To sign stuff."
12:49;12:51;"Yeah, yeah, he's charging $30 on autographs."
12:51;12:53;"And Roger Clemens was like a big baseball player of the moment."
12:53;12:54;"Huge."
12:54;12:55;"He was like the..."
12:55;12:58;"One of the great pitchers in Major League history."
12:58;13:03;"And, but, you know, at the height of his career, well the first phase of his career before steroids."
13:03;13:04;"Oh."
13:04;13:06;"Late 80s."
13:06;13:11;"He's sitting in a separate, like, banquet room at the Sheridan."
13:11;13:15;"He has like his high school bro from Houston running security."
13:15;13:18;"And you have to pay $30 to enter the room."
13:18;13:20;"And then you're in this line to like get his autograph."
13:20;13:25;"My mom was like, ""We're not spending $30 on a Roger Clemens autograph. We're just not doing it."""
13:25;13:27;"But then she goes up to the bouncer and she's like,"
13:27;13:32;"""Do you think my son and I could just get a look at Roger?"""
13:32;13:35;"Which is just like adorable."
13:35;13:36;"I want that to happen."
13:36;13:39;"And she thought of that and like is making it happen."
13:39;13:40;"And he's like, ""Okay."""
13:40;13:43;"So he like lets us in and like we're like standing across."
13:43;13:46;"We're still like a good 80 feet out from Clemens."
13:46;13:48;"And he's just like fat."
13:48;13:51;"Like off-season Roger Clemens at 89."
13:51;13:52;"Kenny Powers style."
13:52;13:57;"He's probably clearing like, I don't know, five, eight grand that day."
13:57;14:01;"Sitting in like this like weird baggy like swad'spine of folding table."
14:01;14:06;"Just like signing autographs and like barely making eye contact."
14:06;14:09;"At a random deep Connecticut, Sheridan."
14:09;14:11;"The house is like, ""This is dark."""
18:35;18:50;"You know what just happened this week in Vampire Weekend News?"
18:50;18:51;"No."
18:51;18:52;"It was just so random."
18:52;18:55;"Like, randomly there's like some official account on Twitter called"
18:55;18:57;"Canadian Platinum and Gold."
18:57;18:58;"Uh-huh."
18:58;19:01;"And this past week it just tagged me in a tweet that said,"
19:01;19:06;"""Today, the Vampire Weekend single 'A-Punk' from their first album went gold in Canada."""
19:06;19:07;"Wait, what does that even mean?"
19:07;19:10;"I don't even know what the threshold for Canadian gold is."
19:10;19:13;"In America it's 500,000, so in Canada it's probably much less."
19:13;19:14;"But like the single?"
19:14;19:18;"So that must include purchases on the iTunes Store."
19:18;19:20;"Yes, when you individually buy it on the iTunes Store."
19:20;19:23;"And maybe now it counts streams or something, but just 10 years--"
19:23;19:24;"No, it wouldn't count streams."
19:24;19:26;"I'm sure 'A-Punk' has been streamed like a million times, right?"
19:26;19:28;"On Canada, I don't know."
19:28;19:29;"Oh, I'm sure."
19:29;19:32;"But anyway, this is like 10 years deep."
19:32;19:34;"You sold 500,000 copies of that song."
19:34;19:36;"No, no, no, that's the American threshold."
19:36;19:37;"Actually, let's look up what--"
19:37;19:38;"No, I'm sure it's the same thing, right?"
19:38;19:39;"No, what are you talking about?"
19:39;19:40;"Canada's like--"
19:40;19:41;"Small country?"
19:41;19:43;"Canada's like, what, 18 million people, 20?"
19:43;19:45;"Canadian gold."
19:45;19:46;"Great Neil Young record."
19:46;19:47;"Is that a record?"
19:47;19:48;"No, I'm kidding."
19:48;19:50;"Sounds like it."
19:50;19:53;"Actually, this is kind of interesting, the recording music certifications."
19:53;19:57;"It's changed a lot in the internet era."
19:57;20:00;"The US is one of the countries that hasn't changed that much."
20:00;20:03;"Yeah, in the US, 500,000 to go gold."
20:03;20:05;"In Canada, 40,000."
20:05;20:07;"Okay."
20:07;20:08;"So that just means like--"
20:08;20:11;"Like 8%?"
20:11;20:13;"Yeah, probably like in the past few months, just like--"
20:13;20:15;"That might be skilled to population, actually."
20:15;20:16;"No, no, of course it is."
20:16;20:20;"No, no, like the US is like 320 million or something."
20:20;20:21;"It sounds about right."
20:21;20:22;"What's 8% of that?"
20:22;20:23;"Like 20 million or something?"
20:23;20:24;"25 million?"
20:24;20:26;"You know it's gold in Ecuador?"
20:26;20:28;"8,000?"
20:28;20:29;"3,000."
20:29;20:30;"Japan, 100,000."
20:30;20:31;"How about like states?"
20:31;20:33;"Like what's gold in California?"
20:33;20:35;"Oh, they don't do that, but that'd be hilarious if they did."
20:35;20:36;"Wouldn't that be cool though?"
20:36;20:38;"Like, oh dude, it went gold in North Dakota."
20:38;20:39;"It sold like nine copies."
20:39;20:43;"I don't know if the streaming services do this, but back in the day when you would get"
20:43;20:48;"like from your label the breakdown of sales, it was like hyper specific."
20:48;20:53;"Now people pay more attention to streaming than sales, but I like remember our label"
20:53;20:58;"would send like the, not even like first week, just some random week, they would send the"
20:58;21:00;"breakdown of your sound scan."
21:00;21:06;"So just, you know, just picture this like in like 2014, you could see like, oh, this"
21:06;21:14;"week, four years after it came out in the Dallas Fort Worth area, Contra sold 87 copies."
21:14;21:16;"You still get that still?"
21:16;21:17;"I don't know."
21:17;21:19;"Well, I haven't seen it in a long time, but it exists."
21:19;21:22;"I could probably ask somebody to send it to me."
21:22;21:28;"That gets you wondering like who were like the 32 people in Savannah, Georgia who bought"
21:28;21:29;"Contra."
21:29;21:35;"I mean, I understand why it's, you know, it's such a big business now, like selling consumer"
21:35;21:36;"data."
21:36;21:37;"Right."
21:37;21:38;"It's messed up, but it is fascinating."
21:38;21:41;"If I had access to that stuff, I would look at it all day."
21:41;21:46;"You can get some fairly detailed info on like the streaming services and on Spotify, they"
21:46;21:47;"do like an artist breakdown."
21:47;21:51;"And actually as an artist, you kind of can't look at this stuff too much because it would"
21:51;21:52;"drive you crazy."
21:52;21:58;"But in the streaming era, you could literally see how many people streamed a song every"
21:58;21:59;"day, or like the average."
21:59;22:02;"I don't want to talk about the big songs."
22:02;22:04;"Let's go into like the deep songs."
22:04;22:07;"What do you consider to be like a deep, random Vampire Weekend song?"
22:07;22:08;"Like Hannah Hunt?"
22:08;22:09;"Oh, you'd be surprised."
22:09;22:13;"Hannah Hunt is our sixth most streamed song."
22:13;22:15;"That's a fan favorite."
22:15;22:16;"Shout out to the fans."
22:16;22:17;"What about like Orchata?"
22:17;22:19;"That's our ninth most streamed song."
22:19;22:21;"I want to go deeper."
22:21;22:28;"What's like the second to last track on the vampires in the city, modern vampires in the"
22:28;22:29;"city?"
22:29;22:30;"Oh, Hudson."
22:30;22:31;"Yeah, the weird like minor key."
22:31;22:32;"Yeah, minor key."
22:32;22:34;"That's our 33rd most streamed song."
22:34;22:36;"Okay, yeah, let's get into it."
22:36;22:41;"Hudson today on Spotify was streamed 2,700 times."
22:41;22:42;"That's a lot, dude."
22:42;22:43;"Yeah, you know, that's not bad."
22:43;22:49;"To put things in perspective, like that DJ Khaled song was probably streamed 9 million"
22:49;22:50;"times today, but you know."
22:50;22:56;"What do you think like a mid-level, like Emerson, Lake and Palmer song was streamed?"
22:56;22:57;"Like a rando?"
22:57;22:59;"Yeah, not like Lucky Man."
22:59;23:03;"Like the 10th most popular Emerson, Lake and Palmer song."
23:03;23:07;"It might not be that much better than Hudson, maybe a little lower."
23:07;23:09;"Like just because think about it."
23:09;23:10;"Yeah, Lucky Man."
23:10;23:13;"Lucky Man is probably putting up 6K."
23:13;23:15;"I don't know."
23:15;23:16;"6,000?"
23:16;23:18;"I mean, the user base."
23:18;23:21;"Oh, what a lucky man."
23:21;23:25;"The user base of Spotify probably is like a little bit younger."
23:25;23:30;"I mean, I'll show you like today, A Punk, our most streamed song was streamed 84,000"
23:30;23:31;"times."
23:31;23:32;"Wow."
23:32;23:33;"But then on the bottom."
23:33;23:34;"That's a lot, bro."
23:34;23:35;"That's a classic song."
23:35;23:36;"It makes you feel good."
23:36;23:42;"And also, you know, people watch Step Brothers."
23:42;23:43;"Sure."
23:43;23:44;"The classic song."
23:44;23:45;"What's that song?"
23:45;23:46;"Okay."
23:46;23:48;"Our lowest streaming songs are all like remixes."
23:48;23:54;"California English, live from Bonnaroo, put up 387."
23:54;23:56;"Even that sounds like a lot to me."
23:56;24:00;"I apologize to anybody who's listening to us live from Bonnaroo."
24:00;24:01;"What about that?"
24:01;24:03;"I just don't recall being that tight."
24:03;24:05;"That weird deep cut we played once."
24:05;24:06;"B-side."
24:06;24:08;"Oh, from the movie soundtrack?"
24:08;24:09;"Yeah, what's that one called?"
24:09;24:10;"Jonathan Lowe?"
24:10;24:11;"Yeah, Jonathan."
24:11;24:13;"It's not available on Spotify."
24:13;24:16;"All these songs came out a little bit in the pre-streaming era."
24:16;24:17;"Right."
24:17;24:22;"I'm curious, like when dropping an album, the one I'm working on now, because honestly,"
24:22;24:23;"the music industry is crazy now."
24:23;24:25;"People, they're all like obsessed with streaming."
24:25;24:29;"When they even talk about like what order to put their songs in on a record, they're"
24:29;24:34;"just like, ""Uh, look, that might've been cool 10 years ago, but in the streaming era,"
24:34;24:37;"I think we gotta blah, blah, blah."""
24:37;24:39;"Just like front load the record?"
24:39;24:43;"Yeah, because in the streaming era, everybody's obsessed with like skip rates and stuff."
24:43;24:44;"What is that?"
24:44;24:49;"If they put your song on a playlist, which, because also think about it, like say you"
24:49;24:51;"want to listen to a Guided by Voices song, you're a fan."
24:51;24:54;"You're coming to Guided by Voices, you're going to listen to like what's a classic"
24:54;24:55;"GBV song for you?"
24:55;24:56;"Game of Pricks."
24:56;25:00;"So Jake wants your Game of Pricks, he goes on to streaming service, he plays it."
25:00;25:01;"Yeah."
25:01;25:02;"He knows what he's looking for."
25:02;25:05;"He searches Guided by Voices, Game of Pricks, he listens to it."
25:05;25:06;"Yeah."
25:06;25:10;"Now, for all the other users who don't know Guided by Voices or are not thinking about"
25:10;25:14;"them on a daily, it's safe to say you think about Guided by Voices every day."
25:14;25:15;"Yeah."
25:15;25:16;"Right."
25:16;25:17;"Very safe to say."
25:17;25:22;"So for everybody else, they're probably going to be introduced to Guided by Voices via playlist."
25:22;25:23;"Via the show maybe."
25:23;25:24;"Or yeah, via the show."
25:24;25:25;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it."
25:25;25:32;"But so let's say somehow you landed Guided by Voices on the Rap Hits of Today playlist."
25:32;25:36;"Suddenly, you might get a million people listening to it in a day."
25:36;25:39;"How many of those people are going to keep listening to it is debatable, but like, so"
25:39;25:41;"people really want to get on playlists now."
25:41;25:46;"They're tracking like, if it's like 20 seconds in, everyone's just like skipping forward."
25:46;25:47;"Exactly."
25:47;25:52;"So say Jake, you're one of like the major players in the 90s indie rock playlist scene."
25:52;25:53;"Which I am."
25:53;25:54;"Which you are."
25:54;25:57;"Jake's 90s indie rock playlist, which I guess you got to make now."
25:57;25:59;"You can put it up on our-"
25:59;26:01;"Actually dude, I've started a second playlist."
26:01;26:04;"It's punk, post-punk, and alternative workout mix, but we'll get to that later."
26:04;26:05;"Oh really?"
26:05;26:06;"Yeah."
26:06;26:10;"You could look at that data and you might be like, you know, I started off with Breeder's"
26:10;26:12;"Cannonball, feel good classic song."
26:12;26:13;"Everybody loves it."
26:13;26:14;"Yep."
26:14;26:18;"And then I went into Game of Pricks as a track two on my playlist and I got, the skip rate"
26:18;26:20;"was very high."
26:20;26:21;"And then you might be like, you know what?"
26:21;26:25;"I want people to like play through my whole playlist, like get out of here, God of Barre"
26:25;26:26;"Voices."
27:23;27:38;"Love, love will tear us apart again Love, love will tear us apart again"
27:38;28:04;"[Instrumental]"
28:04;28:10;"I'm in your sleep, all my feelings exposed"
28:10;28:17;"Yet it stays in my mouth, as desperation seems cold"
28:17;28:24;"Is it something so good, just damn much you can't afford?"
28:24;28:50;"Love, love will tear us apart again"
28:50;29:10;"[Instrumental]"
29:10;29:14;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
29:14;29:34;"[Instrumental]"
29:34;29:42;"Spitting and wishing well, you're on your hell crash, on the last splash"
29:42;29:53;"[Instrumental]"
29:53;30:01;"I know you feel the tears, I know you're a real creep"
30:01;30:19;"[Instrumental]"
30:19;30:27;"In the shade, in the shade"
30:27;30:36;"[Instrumental]"
30:36;30:44;"I know you will know them too, I know you're a cannonball"
30:44;30:49;"[Instrumental]"
30:49;30:57;"I'll be your whatever you want, the bong and the sweat gay song"
30:57;31:00;"[Instrumental]"
31:00;31:08;"In the shade, in the shade"
31:08;31:17;"[Instrumental]"
31:17;31:26;"Spitting and wishing well, you're on your hell crash, on the last splash"
31:26;31:29;"[Instrumental]"
31:29;31:38;"I'll be your whatever you want, the bong and the sweat gay song"
31:38;31:55;"[Instrumental]"
31:55;32:03;"In the shade, in the shade"
32:03;32:05;"So do you know the skip rates on your songs?"
32:05;32:13;"No, they don't give you the skip rates, but also because we haven't released music in a long time, we're not really worried about playlists right now."
32:13;32:19;"You know, they show you which playlists you're on. We're not like a majorly playlisted band because that often tends to be about new music."
32:19;32:24;"Do you think like Jimmy Page is getting like a Led Zeppelin stream breakdown?"
32:24;32:26;"Definitely. In fact-"
32:26;32:28;"You think he's looking at it and he's just like-"
32:28;32:29;"Spotify-"
32:29;32:31;"""I love the skip rate and a whole lot of love when we get to that trippy part."""
32:31;32:40;"I'm gonna look at the Spotify page for Led Zeppelin. No disrespect to our employers, Apple Music, who also have a quality streaming service."
32:40;32:45;"But the only reason that Spotify is interesting for this conversation is because they show the numbers."
32:45;32:46;"Yeah."
32:46;32:48;"Which is like for heads like us is hilarious."
32:48;32:49;"No, but the-"
32:49;32:50;"But so like-"
32:50;32:51;"But the numbers are only available to you."
32:51;32:55;"Well, okay. To get that daily breakdown that I looked at, I could only look at that for my band."
32:55;32:56;"Yeah, you had to log in."
32:56;32:59;"But to look at Led Zeppelin, I can still see how many cumulative plays they have."
32:59;33:00;"Oh, yeah, sure, sure."
33:00;33:02;"So what do you think is Led Zeppelin's most streamed song?"
33:02;33:07;"I mean, I want to say ""Stairway,"" but I don't know, ""Black Dog"" or-"
33:07;33:09;"No, dude, ""Stairway"" by Pharr."
33:09;33:10;"Sure."
33:10;33:21;"""Stairway"" has racked up 115 million streams, which means that Jimmy Page and the boys, they might each be taking home like 50k after taxes, you know, 25k."
33:21;33:23;"You know, that's a new vintage guitar for Jimmy."
33:23;33:26;"And then the second, the runner-up, ""A Whole Lotta Love,"" 65 million."
33:26;33:27;"So now-"
33:27;33:29;"So that's a harsh drop-off."
33:29;33:30;"Yeah, man."
33:30;33:32;"""Stairway"" to ""A Whole Lotta."""
33:32;33:36;"So the biggest Led Zeppelin song, 115 mil."
33:36;33:37;"Okay."
33:37;33:39;"What do you think is the biggest ""Guided by Voices"" song?"
33:39;33:41;"""I'm a Scientist""?"
33:41;33:44;"That's the fourth. ""Hold on, Hope."""
33:44;33:52;"Oh, God, of course. That was on their major label album. Not a good song. It was on like, it was featured on a lot of like TV shows."
33:52;33:53;"Okay, so that's why."
33:53;33:54;"It's really-"
33:54;33:55;"""Game of Pricks"" is number two, but-"
33:55;33:58;"See, that's depressing for me as a GBV fan."
33:58;34:00;"You haven't even heard the depressing part yet."
34:00;34:03;"Okay, no, no, no. What I was saying, ""Hold on, Hope"" is not part of the conversation."
34:03;34:06;"Well, clearly the GBV head community has failed the band."
34:06;34:09;"Well, I think the band failed them with that song."
34:09;34:14;"Anyway, ""Hold on, Hope,"" the most streamed ""Guided by Voices"" song on Spotify."
34:14;34:16;"Okay, I have to guess the place."
34:16;34:18;"Yeah, so keep in mind, ""Stairway"" to heaven, 115 million."
34:18;34:21;"Um, I don't know, 800,000?"
34:21;34:23;"Oh, no, you came in too low. 2.5 mil."
34:23;34:27;"Okay. What about ""Game of Pricks""?"
34:27;34:28;"1.2 mil."
34:28;34:29;"Respectable."
34:29;34:37;"So 1.2 mil, that means Spotify is cutting GBV, uh, in the back, roughly a $4,000 check."
34:37;34:39;"I can't even tell with all this stuff anymore."
34:39;34:42;"You got that on lock. Wait, so what's that percentage? Like .5 or-"
34:42;34:47;"I just know because I'm a music industry professional that roughly the Spotify numbers are like,"
34:47;34:50;"a million streams on Spotify is $4,000."
34:50;34:52;"So 10 million is roughly $40,000."
34:52;34:55;"100 million, $400,000."
34:55;34:59;"A billion streams, which I think only three songs have ever gotten."
34:59;35:00;"That's happened?"
35:00;35:02;"Oh, yeah, like Drake, Drake and-"
35:02;35:04;"Highline Bling, that one?"
35:04;35:06;"Uh, maybe, uh, One Dance."
35:06;35:08;"I don't even know it."
35:08;35:10;"If I heard it, I would know it."
35:10;35:13;"Or like, uh, you know, Major Lazer. Some giant-"
35:13;35:14;"Major Lazer?"
35:14;35:16;"Yeah, they had a really big song called ""Hold On."""
35:16;35:18;"All I'm saying is-"
35:18;35:19;"A billion."
35:19;35:23;"If you got a billion plays, I guess they'd be cutting a check for $4 million."
35:23;35:25;"What are the top streaming vampire ones?"
35:25;35:27;"Um, you know."
35:27;35:29;"Vampire versus GBV, here we go."
35:29;35:30;"The-"
35:30;35:32;"You're gonna crush them."
35:32;35:34;"Yeah, I don't want to- no, that's an unfair question."
35:34;35:36;"I don't want it to seem like I'm coming after-"
35:36;35:37;"Different eras."
35:37;35:38;"-GBV."
35:38;35:40;"No, no, no, no, no, no, it's contextual. I'm not saying you're coming after them."
35:40;35:44;"So A-Punk has got about $94 million."
35:44;35:45;"Holy cow."
35:45;35:47;"We're nipping at the heels of Stairway."
35:47;35:48;"Dude!"
35:48;35:50;"See, okay, that's-"
35:50;35:55;"Many people have said that the guitar part for A-Punk is kind of like the Stairway riff of-"
35:55;35:56;"What?"
35:56;35:57;"No, of course not."
35:57;36:00;"But then it's a drop-off."
36:00;36:03;"Unbelievers, $53 million."
36:03;36:04;"Step, $38 million."
36:04;36:05;"Dying Young, $42 million."
36:05;36:06;"I mean, they're decent."
36:06;36:12;"So how do you think that, like, someone that's not a fan of Vampire Weekend only listens to A-Punk,"
36:12;36:15;"and then doesn't continue to Unbelievers?"
36:15;36:19;"So there's a $40 million listener drop-off from A-Punk to Unbelievers."
36:19;36:26;"Or GBV, it's Hold On To Hope to Game of Pricks is like $2 million, or like a million drop-off."
36:26;36:29;"Well, there's two ways to look at the streaming stuff, I think."
36:29;36:33;"One way is to be, like, depressed and be like, ""Man, what a bummer."
36:33;36:36;"It's like the big songs get so much more play than the other ones."""
36:36;36:40;"And like, ""Man, remember back in the day you had to go buy an album and you spent time with it"
36:40;36:42;"and you appreciated the album as an art form?"""
36:42;36:43;"That's the pessimistic view."
36:43;36:50;"The optimistic view would be like, ""Streaming services are like a record store and the radio all in one."""
36:50;36:53;"So like, back in the day, of course more people hear the single."
36:53;36:57;"It's always going to be a drop-off between the number of people who know Stairway"
36:57;36:59;"and who go buy a Led Zep album."
36:59;37:03;"Even with Drake or something, the number of people who know One Dance,"
37:03;37:07;"who don't know, like, track 17 on the record, you know, that's not like that."
37:07;37:11;"I mean, I get that, but what I'm asking is like,"
37:11;37:15;"A-Punk is no longer like a single that's in active rotation."
37:15;37:18;"Like, you're not promoting the first Vampire Weekend album."
37:18;37:22;"And when you were, Spotify wasn't really a thing, or was it?"
37:22;37:24;"No, it literally didn't exist."
37:24;37:28;"So, what accounts for that now?"
37:28;37:29;"I don't know, maybe."
37:29;37:31;"Like, is it just people watching Step Brothers?"
37:31;37:34;"I think it's literally just people watching Step Brothers."
37:34;37:36;"Or if you're not a Zeppelin person,"
37:36;37:38;"and you're like, typing in Zeppelin,"
37:38;37:41;"it starts to like, feed on itself, or like, perpetuate itself."
37:41;37:44;"Yeah, so let's say, maybe you're like, ""Who's that Zeppelin?"""
37:44;37:47;"Maybe you're 12 years old, and you're like,"
37:47;37:52;"""You know what? I'm no longer interested in the artificial palette of modern pop music."
37:52;37:55;"I prefer the tasteful palette of 70s hard rock."""
37:55;37:57;"I've been listening to Time Crisis."
37:57;38:02;"There's this middle-aged guy on the show that talks about the tasteful palette of 70s rock."
38:02;38:06;"In fact, you know, just to bring it full circle from the last episode,"
38:06;38:09;"maybe there's a kid, a 12-year-old guy,"
38:09;38:11;"who always thought One Direction was cool,"
38:11;38:13;"and he's checking out the solo work of Harry Styles."
38:13;38:16;"And then he hears this song called Sign of the Times,"
38:16;38:22;"and he's like, ""Daddy, Daddy, what is this tasteful palette of this Harry Styles song?"
38:22;38:29;"It doesn't sound like the synth-driven, dance music-influenced pop that I normally hear."""
38:29;38:37;"Well, son, that tasteful palette is highly reminiscent of early 70s Bowie and T-Rex."
38:37;38:38;"Maybe a little Elton John."
38:38;38:40;"Maybe a little Elton John."
38:40;38:43;"And he types in ""David Bowie."""
38:43;38:48;"Of course that kid's not going to go listen to, you know, track 8 on low."
38:48;38:49;"Quicksand."
38:49;38:51;"The first thing that's probably going to come up is like Space Oddity,"
38:51;38:54;"or whatever his most streamed song is, he's going to listen to Space Oddity,"
38:54;38:57;"and be like, ""Tight. I like this song."""
38:57;39:00;"And then whether he decides to dig deeper in the David Bowie catalog,"
39:00;39:08;"or maybe he'll say, ""Daddy, Daddy, I love this song Space Oddity."
39:08;39:09;"What should I do next?"""
39:09;39:13;"And then the dad could either say, ""Well, son, I think you should go deep"
39:13;39:15;"into the discography of the late, great David Bowie."""
39:15;39:20;"Or he might say, ""You know what, son? You should save that song to a playlist,"
39:20;39:23;"and let's continue hunting for some other gems with the tasteful 70s palette."""
39:23;39:24;"Let's move on."
39:24;39:25;"And then you move on."
39:29;39:32;"Time Crisis on Beat One."
39:36;39:43;"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good, he's weird and giggly."
39:43;39:52;"And the spider's crumpled, he played it left hand, but made it too far."
39:52;40:00;"Became the special man, but then we were Ziggy's band."
40:00;40:06;"Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo,"
40:06;40:09;"like some cat from Japan."
40:09;40:16;"He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave them to hang."
40:16;40:24;"Became one so loaded man, well hung, snow white tan."
40:24;40:30;"So where were the spiders?"
40:30;40:40;"While the fly tried to break our bones, just the beer liked to guide us."
40:40;40:47;"So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?"
41:00;41:06;"Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo."
41:06;41:16;"The kids were just crass, he was the nastiest, with God-given ass."
41:16;41:23;"He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar."
41:23;41:35;"Making love with his ego, Ziggy sucked up into his mind."
41:35;41:42;"Like a left-hand messiah, when the kids had killed a man,"
41:42;41:46;"I had to bring up the band."
42:09;42:22;"Ziggy played guitar."
42:22;42:26;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
42:26;42:30;"Beats 1."
42:30;42:36;"So Jake, this news already broke, but we would be remiss not to mention on Time Crisis..."
42:36;42:38;"[laughter]"
42:38;42:40;"How are those tortilla chips?"
42:40;42:41;"Great."
42:41;42:43;"Washing it down with a Modelo."
42:43;42:46;"Love your brand loyalty with Modelo."
42:46;42:48;"It's a good beer."
42:48;42:49;"Great beer."
42:49;42:54;"But anyway, Doritos teamed up with Marvel Studios to promote Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in an unusual way."
42:54;42:58;"They've created a custom-designed limited edition series of Doritos bags"
42:58;43:04;"with a built-in rechargeable cassette deck-inspired player that plays the movie's full soundtrack."
43:04;43:06;"Cassette deck-inspired?"
43:06;43:08;"Basically, it's like a little..."
43:08;43:09;"Piece of plastic."
43:09;43:12;"A little piece of plastic with a little hard drive in it that has MP3s of these songs,"
43:12;43:14;"and it looks like a cassette deck."
43:14;43:17;"And so there's speakers built into the bag?"
43:17;43:20;"I think maybe there's an eighth-inch jack."
43:20;43:22;"You plug in your earbuds."
43:22;43:24;"You can plug your earbuds in."
43:24;43:26;"Oh, it comes with headphones."
43:26;43:28;"Oh, it comes with kind of like '80s-looking headphones."
43:28;43:35;"The Time Crisis social media presence went off the rails with this news."
43:35;43:39;"It was like the fusion of Doritos and classic rock, really."
43:39;43:43;"Because it's like all '70s, like Top 40 stuff, right?"
43:43;43:44;"Yeah, exactly."
43:44;43:50;"Like stuff we might hear in the Top 5 if we were doing 1973 Top 5."
43:50;43:53;"Exactly, because in the film, well, I saw the first one."
43:53;43:56;"Chris Pratt is a boy abducted from Earth at a young age."
43:56;43:57;"I saw it, too."
43:57;43:59;"The way that he remembers Earth is with a beloved mixtape."
43:59;44:00;"Right."
44:00;44:02;"But he wasn't abducted from the '70s, right?"
44:02;44:05;"He just had like an oldies tape."
44:05;44:07;"No, I think he was abducted from maybe the '80s."
44:07;44:08;"Oh, really? Okay."
44:08;44:10;"You know, because it's like he's a kid."
44:10;44:12;"Why do you build me up?"
44:12;44:13;"Yeah, exactly."
44:13;44:17;"And he gets taken, and then he's all grown up."
44:17;44:22;"So it would be like if you got abducted from a baseball card store when you were 12."
44:22;44:24;"Right."
44:24;44:27;"And all you had was like a Don Mattingly baseball card."
44:27;44:29;"And like a Motley Crue tape."
44:29;44:34;"And if you had a Motley Crue tape, you'd be blasting that as you cruise the interstellar speedways."
44:50;44:53;"You know when people talk about like your Desert Island discs?"
44:53;44:54;"Yeah."
44:54;44:57;"I'm just always like, ""What's the one record?"""
44:57;45:00;"I'd be like, ""Whatever record I took, I would hate."""
45:00;45:03;"Right, within like a month or a week."
45:03;45:08;"Especially because you'd be listening to this record, and you'd be like, ""I'm stranded on this island. I'm gonna die here."""
45:08;45:13;"This is the soundtrack of my misery and solitude and imminent death."
45:13;45:19;"You'd probably use the record to like kill an animal or something."
45:19;45:20;"Right."
45:20;45:26;"You'd try to like start a fire by like reflecting the sun rays onto some like bark shaving."
45:26;45:33;"You'd like have a gaping wound on your hand, melt the vinyl into it."
45:33;45:36;"You'd have a record player on the island."
45:36;45:41;"Oh yeah, that record player would be getting stripped for parts immediately."
45:41;45:43;"Yeah. Desert Island disc."
45:43;45:51;"Honestly, if I was stranded on a desert island, I'd rather simply have a hacky sack than any record that's ever been made."
45:51;45:52;"Tight call."
45:52;45:55;"At least I'd be something to do, get really good at hacky sack."
45:55;46:03;"Yeah, I think having one record, oh my god, it would just like make the passing of time so profound."
46:03;46:06;"Like you'd listen to this record, it's like 42 minutes long."
46:06;46:13;"You'd be like, ""Well, I listened to it, it's 42 minutes later, I'm gonna be here for the next 40 years."
46:13;46:23;"Cool, I'll listen to it again maybe later today and waste another 42 minutes of my life when I could be like trying to like hunt some wild boar down."""
46:23;46:28;"People get all like excited about this stuff, just like you really think 30 years deep,"
46:28;46:34;"you're just gonna be so happy that you have Dark Side of the Moon to listen to?"
46:34;46:40;"Thank god I have Alien Lanes so I can listen to Game of Pricks over and over again while I'm starving."
46:40;46:46;"I've waited too long to have you hiding in back of me"
46:46;46:52;"What you did so wrong, I wonder how you keep track of me"
46:52;46:56;"You could never be strong"
46:56;46:59;"You could only be free"
46:59;47:06;"And I never asked for the truth, but you had a right to be"
47:06;47:12;"I'll get to the game, I'll teach you the lines that you better read"
47:12;47:18;"Can't call you without you, I'm always back in need"
47:18;47:25;"I'm down in hell, I'm whipped along with the trees"
47:25;47:31;"And when you come calling me down, I don't have my disease"
47:32;47:43;"(Guitar solo)"
47:43;47:47;"You could never be strong"
47:47;47:50;"You could only be free"
47:50;47:56;"And I never asked for the truth, but you had a right to be"
48:02;48:09;"And I never asked for the truth, but you had a right to be"
48:09;48:12;"I guess something you could dance to would be kind of fun, but also like-"
48:12;48:13;"Solo dancing?"
48:13;48:22;"I'd rather have like a workout tape. I guess it'd be kind of cool if you could take like a Django Reinhardt record and you got a guitar."
48:22;48:24;"Jam to it?"
48:24;48:28;"Jam to something you could do. You try to learn the parts by- that's at least an activity."
48:28;48:29;"Okay."
48:29;48:37;"(Guitar solo)"
48:37;48:46;"Would you rather have like a PlayStation with 50 games or a lifetime supply of Modellos?"
48:46;48:48;"Cold?"
48:48;48:54;"Yeah, let's say there's kind of like a magical fridge and every time you reach in there's an ice cold Modello."
48:54;49:02;"So basically 30 years alone, pounding Modellos, or no Modellos, but you can play like-"
49:02;49:04;"That's a tough call."
49:04;49:05;"You can play like Madden."
49:05;49:08;"I'm not a video games guy at all."
49:08;49:09;"But those are like worlds to explore."
49:09;49:10;"No, I know. I mean-"
49:10;49:12;"You might get into some like RPGs."
49:12;49:13;"If you were-"
49:13;49:14;"Persona 5."
49:14;49:23;"You're on an island by yourself for decades. The time- oh my god. I mean my instinct was to say Modellos, but I don't think that's the wrong move."
49:23;49:26;"Yeah, the video games I think would help pass the time better."
49:26;49:33;"Yeah, I think so. Kind of messed up though, right? Like you're in this like desert island and you're just playing video games all day."
49:33;49:34;"(Laughter)"
49:34;49:39;"See, maybe I'd take the Modellos because I'd have to be working all day just to live."
49:39;49:49;"I'd have to be like scavenging coconuts, amassing firewood to build, shoring up my shelter, trying to build a raft to like get the hell off the island."
49:49;49:52;"Yeah, maybe I'm looking at this through a very modern perspective."
49:52;49:54;"Trying to hunt a boar."
49:54;50:01;"I'm so used to growing up in first world America where everybody has at least a tiny bit of free time."
50:01;50:02;"Yeah."
50:02;50:09;"Because even if you're like got a brutal life and you have to work so many jobs to keep afloat, you still have like an odd day off."
50:09;50:14;"There still is a sense of leisure time. Whereas when people were like scavengers."
50:14;50:19;"No, but even then, you know, when scientists imagine what the hunter-gatherer societies were like."
50:19;50:20;"Sure."
50:20;50:26;"They actually say that there was a more chill time to be alive than in the agrarian era."
50:26;50:28;"Right, I've heard that theory."
50:28;50:33;"You're rolling around with 30 of your closest friends and family."
50:33;50:38;"You guys come across a bunch of fruit trees."
50:38;50:41;"What do you do? You sit down, you shoot the..."
50:41;50:44;"Eat some delicious mangoes and you move on."
50:44;50:47;"As opposed to agrarian societies where you got to till the earth."
50:47;50:48;"Right."
50:48;50:49;"Non-stop."
50:49;50:50;"You're working."
50:50;50:56;"Well, okay, but if you don't find the mangoes or the wild boar, then you're screwed."
50:56;51:00;"You need the medellos to go with the wild boar."
51:00;51:03;"That's what I'm thinking."
51:03;51:06;"Right, you get really good at hunting."
51:06;51:12;"You're barbecuing like seagulls and you're just like, ""Good Lord, I wish I could wash this down with the medello."""
51:12;51:15;"That might also help if the food is real nasty."
51:15;51:16;"Yeah."
51:16;51:19;"Because you might not have access to salsas."
51:19;51:23;"Or if you are starving, the beers are a carb load."
51:23;51:24;"Yeah, that's true."
51:24;51:26;"Okay, you've really fleshed that out."
51:26;51:27;"All right, so we got it."
51:27;51:37;"If ever an evil billionaire tells you to pick your favorite record because you're about to go live on an island by yourself for the rest of your life, just try to bargain."
51:37;51:41;"How about a fridge full of ice cold medellos?"
51:41;51:43;"Lifetime supply."
51:43;51:45;"Desert Island discs."
51:45;51:48;"Honestly, even just thinking about it stresses me out."
55:56;55:58;"Let's get in the top five."
55:58;56:04;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
56:04;56:08;"All right, Jake, so this week on the top five, we're taking it back to 1976."
56:08;56:10;"Woo!"
56:10;56:15;"We're going to compare the top five songs on iTunes today to the top five Billboard hits of 1976."
56:15;56:16;"Why?"
56:16;56:17;"Why 1976?"
56:17;56:19;"Bicentennial year?"
56:19;56:20;"No."
56:20;56:21;"Far from it."
56:21;56:22;"The year before I was born."
56:22;56:23;"Well, kind of."
56:23;56:24;"The year I was conceived."
56:24;56:28;"The year Jake was conceived and also the year that Ja Rule was born."
56:28;56:29;"Oh!"
56:29;56:36;"Ja Rule has been in the news the past couple weeks a lot because he helped start a festival called Fire."
56:36;56:37;"Right."
56:37;56:38;"That was down in the Bahamas."
56:38;56:39;"Went south."
56:39;56:40;"It didn't turn out well."
56:40;56:43;"That's been well covered in the media."
56:43;56:45;"We're not going to add insult to injury."
56:45;56:49;"So actually, we want to celebrate Ja Rule by remembering that he was born 41 years ago."
56:49;56:52;"I didn't really follow the story."
56:52;56:56;"Was it incompetence or a scam?"
56:56;56:58;"And I could be talking about Trump here, too."
56:58;56:59;"I know."
56:59;57:00;"That's like one of the big questions in life."
57:00;57:03;"Every day there's something you look at and you're like, ""Is this incompetence or a scam?"""
57:03;57:10;"I didn't actually ever click on an article about that festival consciously, so I only got the periphery of the story."
57:10;57:13;"Let's say gross incompetence is probably closer."
57:13;57:14;"Okay."
57:14;57:18;"Because it's not really a scam because these dudes are getting lawsuits."
57:18;57:19;"They're getting sued."
57:19;57:20;"Yeah, it's not."
57:20;57:22;"If it was a scam, they would have had to make it slightly nicer."
57:22;57:23;"Right."
57:23;57:27;"Then people would have been merely disappointed, not outraged and scared."
57:27;57:29;"You're not disappointed."
57:29;57:31;"What was that?"
57:31;57:32;"I don't know."
57:32;57:33;"Bad Trump impression?"
57:33;57:45;"The number five song this week in 1976, ""Wings,"" the post-Beatles band of Paul McCartney."
57:45;57:46;"I know this song."
57:46;57:47;"It's called ""Silly Love Songs."""
57:47;57:48;"Oh, God."
57:52;57:54;"Tribute beginning, dude."
57:54;57:56;"That's kind of interesting for 1976."
57:56;57:57;"Kind of like Nine Inch Nails."
57:57;57:59;"Yeah, it sounds like weird sampled."
58:05;58:11;"My understanding is that when this song came out, it was a huge hit for him."
58:11;58:15;"This was kind of like when people were like, ""You know what, Paul, man?"
58:15;58:17;"You've always been like a corn ball."
58:17;58:18;"You sold out."""
58:18;58:22;"What happened to the guy who wrote, ""When I'm 64?"""
58:22;58:23;"Wait, that's ... No."
58:23;58:25;"I'm just kidding."
58:25;58:27;"I'm just saying because the Beatles had so much ..."
58:27;58:30;"The guy that wrote ""Hey Jude"" or whatever."
58:30;58:33;"The guy that played drums on ""Tomorrow Never Knows."""
58:33;58:37;"What happened to the guy who wrote ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer?"""
58:37;58:38;"I'm still here."
58:50;58:53;"Kind of like a little bit of a disco vibe here."
58:53;58:55;"Yeah, it's a light disco."
58:55;58:56;"I'm loving the bass playing."
58:56;58:57;"I wonder if that's Paul."
58:57;59:00;"Oh yeah, a great bass player."
59:00;59:07;"I guess around this time, John Lennon was getting faced with Harry Nilsson at the Troubadour."
59:07;59:08;"Right."
59:08;59:10;"Oh, this is interesting."
59:10;59:15;"Apparently, this song was written as a rebuttal to both music critics and John Lennon,"
59:15;59:18;"who accused McCartney of writing lightweight love songs."
59:18;59:25;"This song is self-aware because he's saying, ""You'd think people would have had enough of silly love songs."""
59:25;59:26;"What's wrong with that?"
59:27;59:29;"I got to say, there's something ..."
59:29;59:30;"It's a pretty weak song."
59:30;59:37;"It's a weak song, but there's something kind of hilarious about maybe he and John got together"
59:37;59:42;"and John was like ... We've debated his song ""Imagine"" on this show before."
59:42;59:47;"Whether or not ""Imagine"" is truly a deep song, but John's like, ""What happened to you, man?"""
59:47;59:49;"""You're a cornball."""
59:49;59:52;"""I'm writing songs like 'Imagine.'"""
59:52;59:53;"Mind games."
59:53;59:55;"""Jealous guy."""
59:55;59:57;"""What are you writing?"""
59:57;59:58;"""A bunch of silly love songs."""
59:58;01:00:00;"And Paul's like, ""Okay, man."""
01:00:00;01:00:01;"And then he writes this song."
01:00:01;01:00:05;"""Oh yeah? I write silly love songs? Well, what's wrong with that?"""
01:00:05;01:00:09;"""And here I go again."""
01:00:09;01:00:13;"Now I'm going to write self-aware, semi-ironic love songs."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Is that going to please you, you cynical ..."
01:00:15;01:00:22;"When Paul McCartney sings ""Here I Go Again,"" I just picture him on a cute little roller coaster"
01:00:22;01:00:28;"with Linda at his side, just looking at John scowling at him, just two middle fingers in the air."
01:00:28;01:00:32;"""Here I go again."""
01:00:32;01:00:39;"I love you"
01:00:39;01:00:47;"I love you"
01:00:55;01:01:00;"I can't explain the feelings, please"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Now can't you see"
01:01:03;01:01:08;"Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Now can't you see"
01:01:10;01:01:14;"What's wrong with that"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"I need to know"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Yeah, this is the part where it's kind of dark."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Two middle fingers in the air. F*** you, John!"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"""Eat it, Lennon!"""
01:01:22;01:01:26;"Yeah"
01:01:26;01:01:31;"""I love you"""
01:01:31;01:01:36;"Oh, you know what it is? It's like they're at the water park, and he's going up in the log flume,"

01:02:25;01:02:29;"No, yeah, I hear what you're saying. I'm stalling because they're different eras."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"Right."

01:02:33;01:02:40;"Yes, and I used to feel very strongly that 'Strawberry Fields Forever' was so much deeper, and as I get older I'm like, ""Eh."""

01:03:12;01:03:13;"Bruno's much more of a Paul."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Yeah."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"And I'll tell you why."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"[Laughter]"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"Paul and Bruno are both incredibly technically talented songwriters."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Right."
01:03:23;01:03:30;"And I bet if you said to them, because we talked last time about how Bruno and Tom York from Radiohead have beef,"
01:03:30;01:03:40;"and probably similarly to Paul and John, I bet they're the type of dudes that there's some kind of distance between them as people and the voice of the songs they write."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Yeah."
01:03:41;01:03:49;"So I bet if you said to Bruno or Paul, ""Your guys' songs are kind of lightweight,"" you know what I'm saying?"
01:03:49;01:03:54;"They'd be like, ""Oh, you want me to write a Radiohead, John Lennon song? Give me five minutes."""
01:03:54;01:03:55;"And they would sit down at the piano and probably--"
01:03:55;01:03:56;"I'll crap this out."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"And they'd probably write something that sounded kind of close."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"Yeah."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"I'm not saying it'd be as good, but something that's kind of close and being like, ""Oh, yeah, Radiohead."""

01:04:07;01:04:09;"And I bet Bruno could do a sick Tom York impression."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Oh my God."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"And the lyrics are always like, ""Playing the shot."""
01:04:13;01:04:18;"So in that sense, they're both razzle-dazzle showmen."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"Yeah."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"I witness this all the time in the music industry."
01:04:21;01:04:29;"There's always a tension between the razzle-dazzle showmen and who they perceive to be the authentic serious dudes."
01:04:29;01:04:36;"Because the razzle-dazzle dudes look at the authentic dudes and say, ""I'm more talented than you."""
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Right. I can do that."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"""I can do what you do, but you can't do what I do."""
01:04:38;01:04:42;"""I can bang out a Radiohead song, but you can't make a 'That's What I Like.'"""
01:04:42;01:04:44;"And then the authentic dudes are like, ""You guys are cornballs."""
01:04:44;01:04:45;"""You guys are so corny."""
01:04:45;01:04:47;"Which is not as strong an argument."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"You know, it'd be interesting if Radiohead did..."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Tried to go pop?"
01:04:51;01:04:59;"Yeah, it'd be interesting if they just went with full Bruno Mars production, but wrote songs over that."
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Maybe not Radiohead, but a Tom York solo record."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Yeah."
01:05:03;01:05:06;"I'd like to see him get in the booth with Bruno."

01:05:38;01:05:49;"Now, Elvin does not sing lead vocals."
01:05:49;01:05:55;"This is his background singer, Mickey Thomas, who went on to become the lead singer of Jefferson Starship."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Okay."
01:05:57;01:06:02;"""I didn't care how much they cried, no sir."""
01:06:02;01:06:07;"Yeah, I've seen Boogie Nights so many times that I can't separate this song out."
01:06:07;01:06:14;"It's a scene where Philip Seymour Hoffman is just shoving wedding cake into his mouth."
01:06:14;01:06:20;"And it's when Becky Barnett is marrying the guy that works at the Pep Boys."
01:06:20;01:06:23;"And John C. Reilly is like, ""We're losing these two."""
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"It's a real short scene."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"I mean, what else can you say about this song?"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"Nice 70s."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"Mellow pop soul."
01:06:33;01:06:38;"The number four song on iTunes right now, this is the one that really has legs."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"Jake, can you name it in the first five seconds?"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"What is it?"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"Coldplay and Chainsmokers."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Chainsmokers and Coldplay."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"Okay."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"Get the order right."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"A little old."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"I'm glad it's back in the top five."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"You can't keep a song like this down."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"Dude, between this and the Bruno, we're off to a great start here."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Hold on, listen to this."
01:07:27;01:07:33;"As of this week, the Chainsmokers have had a top ten song for an entire year straight."
01:07:33;01:07:40;"So that means a week has not gone by in the past year when the Chainsmokers were not in the top ten."
01:07:40;01:07:45;"And I feel like even every single episode that we've done of this show..."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Just about."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"I mean, I could say, yeah, more or less top five."
01:07:49;01:07:53;"They're major artists."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"So you know what's funny?"
01:07:54;01:07:58;"We've probably listened to like three hours total of Chainsmokers on this show."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"A lot of Chainsmokers."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Also, it's funny, remember when Coldplay came out, they were kind of seen as like,"
01:08:03;01:08:07;"are they the heirs to Radiohead in some ways?"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"Right."
01:08:08;01:08:11;"Kind of similar epic rock style."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"And then as time went on, Radiohead went further left and more electronic,"
01:08:14;01:08:18;"and Coldplay became more of a considered pop artist."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Yeah."
01:08:19;01:08:23;"It would have been even funnier if at that Radiohead show, this one came on."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Oh, wow."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"Just like Tom York ends."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Oh, f***."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"It would have been much more confusing."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Right."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"You're talking about could Radiohead work over Bruno Mars' production."
01:08:40;01:08:44;"Well, Chris Martin works over Chainsmokers' production, so why not?"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"I wonder how many times Chris Martin and Tom York have interacted."
01:08:47;01:08:50;"That's a great question."
01:08:50;01:08:54;"And-- You're going to say above 10 or under 10?"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"They both spend time in LA."
01:08:55;01:08:59;"I've seen both of them out and about in Los Angeles."
01:08:59;01:09:03;"You think over 10 or under 10?"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"On them being like-- Like in the same room?"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"Chris, nice to meet you."
01:09:06;01:09:10;"Tom, I've just been dying to meet you."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"God, I don't even want to like play this out."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I can picture their interaction so well."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"It hurts my feelings."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"It hurts your feelings?"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"It hurts my feelings."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Or like you're bummed for Chris?"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"It hurts all my feelings."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Too painful to play out."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"I just feel like--"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"That's a time crisis first."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"I really do respect both of those guys as songwriters."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"I think they've both written incredible songs."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"Sure."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"It's that duality that we talked about."
01:09:37;01:09:44;"It's that Lennon-McCartney, like I'm sure that Tom York probably thinks like,"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"""We've gone deeper into the human psyche,"" and blah, blah."
01:09:46;01:09:51;"And Chris Martin's like, ""Yeah, but you never wrote something just like this."""
01:09:51;01:09:54;"It'd be an amazing one-act play."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"Like, Frost/Nixon."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"York/Martin."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"York/Martin."
01:09:59;01:10:05;"If you're a good playwright, really delve into notions of artistic authenticity and voice"
01:10:05;01:10:11;"and how much of that is real, how much of that is just BS and just--"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"Or just-- Yeah, just--"
01:10:12;01:10:15;"--circumstance and timing and--"
01:10:15;01:10:20;"Man, I would love that, just to get into that, just have two artists come together"
01:10:20;01:10:26;"and just talk about artistic intent, but also get into some of that stuff that's like,"
01:10:26;01:10:31;"""You know what, man? When I first met you at the 2001 BRIT Awards,"
01:10:31;01:10:36;"all I said was 'hi,' and you looked at me like I asked you for an autograph, man."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Like, what's up with that?"""
01:10:38;01:10:40;"Now I'm starting to play it out."

01:10:44;01:10:47;"At first, Tom York is all like, ""Whatever."""
01:10:47;01:10:54;"And then later, Chris Martin, who kind of comes across as a more sensitive, empathic kind of guy,"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"he's the one to be like, ""Come on, man, just talk to me. Talk to me like a human."""
01:10:57;01:10:59;"And Tom York's like, ""Whatever, whatever."""
01:10:59;01:11:04;"And then finally Tom York cracks, and he's like, ""All right, you know what, man?"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"Yeah, I wish the Chainsmokers would call me."
01:11:07;01:11:10;"I wish that I had a top-five song on iTunes."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"You know, like I've had the critically acclaimed Edgy album."
01:11:14;01:11:19;"Yeah, you know what, man? I'm actually jealous of you, man."
01:11:19;01:11:25;"And yeah, I take it out on people like Bruno Mars, 'cause I just want to be your friend, man."""

01:27:49;01:27:53;"Wait, is that the show? Yeah, Welcome Back. Mr. Cotter? Yeah, Welcome Back Cotter."
01:27:53;01:27:58;"I don't know the show. What's the song? It's called Welcome Back. I don't think I've ever seen a full episode of this show."
01:27:58;01:28:05;"I vaguely remember it was on Nick at Night back in the day. And I know that it was Mr. Cotter, it was the teacher,"
01:28:05;01:28:10;"and these were like a bunch of knuckleheads in his class. And like John Travolta would always be like, ""Hey, Mr. Cotter."""
01:28:10;01:28:14;"I mean, I've probably seen more like parodies of it than I've ever seen the show."
01:28:14;01:28:19;"But even without listening to it, I know how the song goes. It goes, ""Welcome back."""
01:28:19;01:28:26;"It's composed by John Sebastian. Who performed it? Yeah, he's a famous songwriter."
01:28:26;01:28:33;"Sweet. Was John Sebastian involved with the Mamas and Papas? I think. Or some other band."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"No, it's John Phillips. Loving Spoonful. Oh, okay."
01:28:36;01:28:43;"This is number one? People were buying like seven inches of this."
01:28:43;01:28:51;"Yeah, there used to be three channels. I want to go by the mall and like, I got to pick up a shirt for work and pick up the new seven inch of Welcome Back."
01:28:51;01:29:01;"Yeah. Culture used to be a lot more narrow. It'd be like, at the end of the episode,"
01:29:01;01:29:11;"""Hey, what's up guys? This is John Travolta. I want you to go by, go to the supermarket and pick up the 45 of the theme from Welcome Back Cotter by John Sebastian."""
01:29:11;01:29:17;"That's probably enough to make it number one. Travolta's a year in Scientology at this point."
01:29:17;01:29:26;"Oh, did he become a Scientologist in '75? Yeah, I remember reading that. I remember that first, I'm weird with years. Sometimes they would stick in my craw."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"Right. '75 is the year Travolta started. Yeah."
01:29:30;01:29:36;"""Hey guys, I'm John Travolta."" Kind of a Rennie Newman vibe a little bit, right? Yeah, totally. It's a good song."
01:29:36;01:29:45;"""If you want to go clear like me, you got to pick up Welcome Back Cotter, theme song, along with a copy of Dianetics."""
01:29:46;01:29:50;"Shout out to L. Ron Hubbard and John Sebastian."
01:29:50;01:30:06;"I wonder if Travolta and Hubbard had FaceTime. Because Hubbard died in '86. I bet, well, no, but Hubbard was so isolated."
01:30:06;01:30:10;"Yeah, they probably had some FaceTime. But he was so isolated and reclusive."
01:30:10;01:30:18;"I've met somebody who met Hubbard. Whoa. We'll talk about that after the show. Really? You can't get into it? They're going to come after you?"
01:30:18;01:30:27;"I don't want to mess with Scientology. How old is this person that met Hubbard? I got enough on my plate, in their 60s. Wow. Maybe 70s."
01:30:27;01:30:33;"Was it a long hang? All I know is that they met. Next time I see this person, I'm going to ask some questions. Okay, because that's fascinating."
01:30:33;01:30:40;"I'm going to approach in a very neutral way, just like you met a famous guy. Same way that if you told me you met Tom York, I'd ask you how it went down."
01:30:40;01:30:46;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:30:46;01:30:51;"Jake, do you know who Niall Horan is? I don't. Niall Horan?"
01:30:51;01:31:05;"First name N-I-A-L-L. Ooh. Niall? Nope. British person? Last name Horan. H-O-R-A-N. Yes, I believe he's British. Might be Irish."
01:31:05;01:31:16;"One of the two. Niall Horan. He's sitting atop the iTunes chart right now with a song called Slow Hands. No idea who he is."
01:31:16;01:31:23;"Asking me or telling me? Oh, I know who he is. Oh, you do? Okay. I have no idea. I'm asking you. Never heard the name in my life."
01:31:23;01:31:33;"Well, let me read you a little bit about him. Niall Horan is from One Direction. Wow, One Direction. What happened to Harry Styles?"
01:31:33;01:31:41;"He's not in the top five this week. That's messed up. I think the song's doing all right. I heard it in the gym, dude."
01:31:41;01:31:50;"It's at a tight. Okay, so now you're coming around on the Harry Styles song. I was kickboxing with my brother. What? You're kickboxing now?"
01:31:50;01:31:57;"Yeah, we go to kickboxing classes on Saturday morning. Okay, I like that. It's like 20, 25 people, very co-ed class."
01:31:57;01:32:07;"There's a teacher with a wireless headset mic that's just like, ""Okay, guys, body shots."" We lace up, put on gloves, and we're punching bags."
01:32:07;01:32:12;"Then we're doing roundhouse kicks, down, give me 10 pushups. You can do a roundhouse kick? Poorly, yes."
01:32:12;01:32:19;"Are you kicking Dave in the face? No, no, no, a bag, a hanging-- Oh, everybody has a bag? It's like two people per bag."
01:32:19;01:32:24;"Oh, and you wait in line? No, you're the opposite size of the bag. Are you building up to fight Dave?"
01:32:24;01:32:31;"No, no, I don't actually want to actually spar. That does not interest me. So you're training just for-- Yeah, just getting in shape, conditioning."
01:32:31;01:32:39;"Okay, all right. It's brutal. It's an hour. It's insane. And they're just blasting-- It's a lot of cardio. Pop radio or something?"
01:32:39;01:32:49;"This trainer dude was like, ""I made a killer playlist."" Oh, really? And it had, ""It's the sign of the times"" on there."
01:32:49;01:32:58;"Just stop your crying, it's the sign of the times. It also had nine-inch nails hurt, which thematically, strong choice."
01:32:58;01:33:03;"But that's just like ballad. He's like, ""25 pushups,"" and you're just like, ""Ugh, chur, chur."""
01:33:03;01:33:16;"I hurt myself today. 15. To see if I still-- 16. Brutal. When you're really working out, it's like the music is meaningless."
01:33:16;01:33:22;"Well, that's why I'm making my post-punk and alternative workout playlist. I can't wait to hear that."
01:33:22;01:33:26;"Anyway, we heard-- So it came on and you were like, ""This is tight."" Yeah, yeah, I was feeling it."
01:33:26;01:33:32;"Oh, so you were like, ""Honestly, I'm glad to hear something with a tasteful '70s palette from one of the young guns."""
01:33:32;01:33:39;"I think anything at that volume sounds good. That's my theory. Okay. You're gonna like this, man. Okay."
01:33:39;01:33:47;"So Niall Horan-- So, former bandmate of Harry. Yeah. Wendy's got a deep bench."
01:33:47;01:33:56;"He said Wendy's has a deep bench. 1D. Okay. 1D, founded by Dave Thomas, 19--"
01:33:56;01:34:04;"Niall Horan-- We actually listened to one of his songs once. It was kind of like a folky ballad called ""This Old Town"" or something."
01:34:04;01:34:13;"Not ringing a bell. Okay, well, he came out of the gate with not quite a '70s palette, but, you know, a tasteful, modern folk rock pop thing."
01:34:13;01:34:18;"Acoustic guitars. So anyway, before we hear the song, his new single, listen to this."
01:34:18;01:34:25;"According to Horan, after listening to some of the material he had, he wanted to add a bit more grit, funk, and heavier bass."
01:34:25;01:34:31;"At the time, he was listening to late '70s and early '80s music, like Don Henley."
01:34:31;01:34:39;"When he went solo in the early '80s-- Nothing says ""funk"" and ""gritty bass"" more than Don Henley. Don Henley."
01:34:39;01:34:44;"When he went solo in the early '80s, he just kind of had this funky kind of feel to it. Heavy bass, heavy guitar."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"So I just thought, let's give this a crack."
01:34:46;01:34:51;"Dirty laundry, down at the Sunset Grill."
01:34:51;01:34:59;"Is now implying that early Eagles did not have, like, funky bass and guitar? He's got to listen to one of these nights. Right."
01:34:59;01:35:08;"Anyway, so Jake, I mean, this literally must be your wet dream, man. I wouldn't go that far."
01:35:08;01:35:18;"Middle-aged dude who's just been at sea for the past 10 years, wondering when is that tasteful palate you love going to come back."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"I've been at sea."
01:35:20;01:35:30;"Just looking around as society changes, looking for a tasteful palate, and it comes from one of the most likely places."
01:35:30;01:35:36;"Two members of a British boy band, and not just any boy band, one that started on a reality show."
01:35:36;01:35:41;"And he's getting into Don Henley. Things are cooking."
01:35:41;01:35:51;"The movie poster is you, Harry Styles, and Allhorn, and the tagline is like, ""Sometimes help comes when you least expect it."""
01:35:51;01:35:53;"They're helping me."
01:35:53;01:35:58;"Yeah. You run a hardware store on Nantucket."
01:35:58;01:36:01;"These fantasies."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Recently widowed."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Oh my god."
01:36:05;01:36:09;"You run a hardware store on Nantucket. You think you're never going to love again."
01:36:09;01:36:14;"And your teenage daughter only listens to the Chainsmokers."
01:36:14;01:36:19;"And she wants to go to school in Boston."
01:36:19;01:36:23;"And you want her to go to the University of Nantucket."
01:36:23;01:36:28;"And then one summer, all the former members of 1D rent a house together."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"They're trying to do like an exile kind of thing."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"Yeah, they're reuniting for their--"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"Music from Big Pink."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"They're teaming up again to make their Nantucket album."
01:36:37;01:36:46;"They're like, ""We're just going to get hammered on whiskey and just plug our guitars in a PV amp and record."""
01:36:46;01:36:48;"You're down at the local bar."
01:36:48;01:36:52;"You're just like, ""Hey Rudy, make it a double."""
01:36:52;01:36:55;"And then you hear these young cats laughing."
01:36:55;01:36:59;"And you're just saying to Rudy, ""I just don't get it. My daughter only listens to the Chainsmokers."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"She wants to leave Nantucket, man. Where did I go wrong?"""
01:37:02;01:37:03;"Blah, blah, blah."
01:37:03;01:37:11;"And then you just hear these two voices over there like, ""No, mate. T-Rex is better than Bowie."""
01:37:11;01:37:14;"""Nah, mate. Bowie is better than T-Rex."""
01:37:14;01:37:18;"And you just look over like, ""Who are these guys, Rudy?"""
01:37:18;01:37:24;"""Some young boy band out of England. Are they really talking about T-Rex and Bowie?"""
01:37:24;01:37:27;"""Sounds like a joke."""
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Loving this fantasy."
01:37:29;01:37:32;"""You know what, Rudy? Buy them around."""
01:37:32;01:37:35;"""Thanks, dude. What's your deal?"""
01:37:35;01:37:39;"""I'm a widower out in the local hardware store."""
01:37:39;01:37:45;"""Couldn't help but overhear you guys talking about the tasteful palate of early 70s British rock."""
01:37:45;01:37:47;"""Yeah, mate. I love that."""
01:37:47;01:37:50;"""You mean to tell me you young cats aren't at all about the Chainsmokers?"""
01:37:50;01:37:54;"""Nah, mate. Hate the Chainsmokers."""
01:37:54;01:37:56;"""In that case, next round's on me."""
01:37:56;01:37:59;"I don't know. Whatever."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"They get you a new girlfriend."
01:38:02;01:38:06;"Okay, so this is all building up to Niall Horan's new single."
01:38:06;01:38:11;"Influenced by that late 70s, early 80s Don Henley funk."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"I can't wait for this."
01:38:13;01:38:23;"I'm hearing the Henley."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Yeah, it's not... he wasn't blowing smoke."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"No."
01:38:27;01:38:32;"I get my news from the evening news."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"Wait, what?"
01:38:33;01:38:39;"What is that kind of vintage vocal sound?"
01:38:39;01:38:43;"You almost guessed the melody."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"I was thinking ""Dirty Laundry."""
01:38:54;01:38:58;"This is the part where he's like, ""Rented a house by the beach."""
01:38:58;01:39:11;"That's kind of cool."
01:39:11;01:39:15;"This is the part of the movie where stuff starts coming together."
01:39:15;01:39:20;"""Well, Niall, if you're looking for some extra cash, I could use some help around the hardware store."""
01:39:20;01:39:22;"""I'd love that, mate."""
01:39:22;01:39:25;"And this is you guys horsing around."
01:39:25;01:39:29;"He dusts off your old record player to set it up in the hardware store."
01:39:29;01:39:33;"Start putting on tasteful 70s rock while you guys are working."
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I've got to train you on the forklift."
01:39:35;01:39:43;"And then, like, ""You are now a Massachusetts-certified forklift operator."""
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Slow hands!"
01:39:53;01:39:58;"Your daughter walks into the basement, you guys are jamming on some Eagles tunes."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"She just laughs and rolls her eyes."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"""Dad and Niall."""
01:40:02;01:40:16;"Rip it solo, bro."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"It's a nice mix of old and new."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"""Wanna be with you all alone."""
01:40:21;01:40:24;"""Take me home, take me home."""

01:40:30;01:40:32;"Slow hands!"
01:40:32;01:40:35;"""Like sweat dripping down my dirty laundry."""
01:40:35;01:40:36;"""No."""
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Wait, did he say ""dirty laundry""?"
01:40:38;01:40:39;"""Back it up."""
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Wait, like sweat dripping down dirty laundry?"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"That makes no sense."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Laundry absorbs sweat."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Wait, okay, maybe we're missing something here."
01:40:48;01:40:50;"So, I was gonna say, is this like a love song?"
01:40:50;01:40:55;"'Cause Henley, all his solo work was, like, deeply kind of metaphorical."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"It was about aging and..."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Yeah."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Uh, idealism dying."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"The dreams of the 60s not working out."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"These, um..."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Okay, wait, did he say ""laundry""?"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"""Sweat dripping down your dirty laundry."""
01:41:10;01:41:12;"On first listen..."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"I thought it was ""dirty laundry."""
01:41:13;01:41:15;"And did you like the vibe?"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"That's a terrible song, no."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"Oh, really?"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"""Dirty laundry""?"
01:41:19;01:41:20;"No, no, this song."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Oh, it's pretty..."
01:41:22;01:41:24;"Are you a dirty laundry?"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Not hatin' it, not pumpin' me up."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Okay, so the chorus of this song..."
01:41:28;01:41:32;"""Dirty laundry"" is an awful Don Henley song."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"""Dirty laundry."""
01:41:34;01:41:38;"So, for anybody who's not familiar with Don Henley's solo work..."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"Can we get into ""dirty laundry"" for a sec, just for reference?"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"He has a song called ""Dirty Laundry"""
01:41:43;01:41:48;"that, obviously, Niall was inspired by."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"That is amazing to be inspired by ""dirty laundry."""
01:41:50;01:41:52;"I cannot imagine that."
01:41:52;01:41:55;"Of all the pieces of music that..."
01:41:55;01:41:56;"Well, that's like in the movie."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"You're just like..."
01:41:57;01:42:00;"""You're kidding me. You're in a dirty laundry?"""
01:42:00;01:42:03;"""Young kid like you, fan of solo Henley?"""
01:42:03;01:42:04;"""Oh, I love it, mate."""
01:42:04;01:42:09;"""I'm absolutely mad for it, mate."""
01:42:12;01:42:14;"I mean, this sounds like..."

01:42:16;01:42:21;"""Slow hands, sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry."""
01:42:21;01:42:24;"All of a sudden, this sick keyboard drops in."
01:42:24;01:42:31;"Okay, this song is funkier."
01:42:31;01:42:36;"I'm surprised you hate this song."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"This is actually making me appreciate it a lot more."
01:42:40;01:42:48;"I mean, the drumming is sick."
01:43:05;01:43:10;"Henley's scathing critique of the gossip news industry."

01:43:15;01:43:16;"So, Niall says..."
01:43:16;01:43:20;"I want, like, a new Henley song about, like, Facebook."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Or, like, Fox News."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"That's kind of always been his vibe, a little bit like..."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"Yeah, but I want, like, an updated version."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Maybe they exist."

01:43:55;01:43:58;"Actually, doing the Henley impression makes you realize"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"how influenced by Dylan he was."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Right, their voices are pretty different."

01:44:29;01:44:32;"""There's no chance that I'm leaving here without you on me."""
01:44:32;01:44:37;"""I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping your plans and those slow hands."""
01:44:37;01:44:39;"Well, actually, I want to understand what this song's about."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Verse one."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"""We should take this back to my place."""
01:44:41;01:44:43;"That's what she said right to my face."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"""'Cause I want you bad."""
01:44:45;01:44:47;"""Yeah, I want you baby."""
01:44:47;01:44:50;"""I've been thinking about it all day, and I hope you feel the same way."""
01:44:50;01:44:52;"This is kind of similar to Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You."""
01:44:52;01:44:54;"This is a horndog song."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"It's in the horndog genre."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"""And I hope you feel the same way."""
01:44:57;01:44:59;"""I want you bad, yeah, I want you baby, slow hands."""
01:44:59;01:45:03;"""And then I just want to take my time, we could do this baby all night, yeah, 'cause I want you bad, slow hands."""
01:45:03;01:45:04;"God, these lyrics suck."
01:45:04;01:45:05;"Oh, then--"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Harsh."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"No, these lyrics suck."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"There's no--"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Way, way harsh, Ty."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"""The bridge is fingertips putting on a show."""
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Is this specifically about--"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"F***ing?"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"[laughs]"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"I was gonna try to be more elegant about it, Jake, but--"
01:45:19;01:45:20;"F***ing."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"[groans]"
01:45:22;01:45:26;"Is this song about specifically digital stimulation?"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"You always tell me there's this new Katy Perry song called ""Bon Appétit,"""
01:45:29;01:45:33;"and they were saying, you know, that's about a very specific sexual act."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"I always just assume when I hear a horndog--"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"What, a d***?"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"[laughs]"
01:45:37;01:45:42;"No, ""Bon Appétit,"" 'cause she's basically like, ""You're gonna-- I'm setting the table for you to--"""
01:45:42;01:45:43;"What, I don't know."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"""Eat up."""
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Okay."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"It's-- Her song, the Katy Perry song ""Bon Appétit""--"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Ass, right?"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"All I'm saying is, for me, when I hear horndog songs,"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Yeah."
01:45:52;01:45:56;"I always think it's about whatever goes on between two consenting adults in the bedroom."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"But then sometimes people are like, ""No, it's actually about--"""
01:45:59;01:46:02;"'Cause I heard the ""Bon Appétit"" song, and Katy Perry's just like--"
01:46:02;01:46:07;"It's all these extended food metaphors, like, ""Tonight's the night. Gonna eat it up."""
01:46:07;01:46:08;"""Gonna eat it right."""
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Basically."
01:46:10;01:46:13;"Okay, I just wanna read the bridge to the song, to the Nile song."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Digital stimulation!"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"Digital stimulation."
01:46:16;01:46:20;"So, the bridge is, ""Fingertips, puttin' on a show."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"""Got me now and I can't say no."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"""Wanna be with you all alone. Take me home, take me home."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"""Fingertips, puttin' on a show."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"""Can't you tell that I want you ba--"""
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Oh, I don't know. That could be about--"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Maybe she's tickling him."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"These lyrics suck."
01:46:32;01:46:35;"Like, for me, when someone tickles me,"
01:46:35;01:46:40;"to quote-- I remember Snooki once saying this on, remember, ""Jersey Shore""?"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Yeah."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"And I remember she said this in the show, and I really related to it."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"She said, ""I hate being tickled."
01:46:46;01:46:49;"""It might look like I'm laughing and enjoying myself,"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"""but I feel the opposite."""
01:46:51;01:46:52;"That's how I feel."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Wow."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"I don't know about you."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Not a big fan of it."
01:46:55;01:46:58;"When somebody tickles me, I truly get nervous that I'm gonna, like,"
01:46:58;01:47:02;"just spaz out and, uh, you know, like, my limbs--"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"Has that happened recently?"
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Where you've just been, like, in a situation where, like,"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"someone's tickling the crap out of you,"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"and you're just like, ""Jesus Christ, I'm not in control right now!"""
01:47:12;01:47:14;"I have-- No, I'm pretty good at controlling it now"
01:47:14;01:47:19;"because I have memories of being tickled at other points in my life"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"where I was just like, ""Bleh!"""
01:47:20;01:47:23;"And I got close to, like, accidentally smacking somebody in the face,"
01:47:23;01:47:24;"and I don't want to be in that position."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"So if somebody I care about tickles me,"
01:47:26;01:47:30;"I'll kind of go, like, real stiff, like, with my arms pressed up against me"
01:47:30;01:47:33;"and try to just do a barrel roll out of the bed."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"Wow."
01:47:34;01:47:38;"Dude, quick aside, have you seen that Tickled documentary?"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"Oh, it's incredible."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"That's insane."
01:47:40;01:47:43;"And anybody who wants to watch, like, a good gripping documentary,"
01:47:43;01:47:44;"watch Tickled."
01:47:44;01:47:49;"I think I've gotten an email or a tweet from Time Crisis listeners about Tickled."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"Oh, nice. There's some--"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"So just a shout-out to them."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"Shout-out to all Time Crisis listeners."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"It's kind of a movie that you don't really want to explain too much."
01:47:56;01:47:57;"No, no, no."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"It's a documentary about a very strange gripping story."
01:47:59;01:48:02;"It's called Tickled. Check it out."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"I don't think the song is, like, particularly specific."
01:48:04;01:48:07;"He's just-- Slow hands maybe just means we're touching each other,"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"we're taking our time."
01:48:08;01:48:12;"It's a Clapton reference. He's a big Clapton head."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"You're like my guitar."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"So, like, sweat dripping down our dirty laundry."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Yeah, it doesn't totally make sense."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"That's a total nod, obviously, to dirty laundry."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"That's cool that he's paying tribute to Henley."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"Maybe he met her at the bar on Nantucket."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"Things got hot and heavy so quickly, and she was like,"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"""Can we go back to your place?"""
01:48:31;01:48:33;"And he was like-- Straight up to my face."
01:48:33;01:48:36;"Straight up to my face. She said, ""Let's go back to your place."""
01:48:36;01:48:39;"And he's just like, ""I've got to be honest."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"I've got a summer rental with my guys. It's kind of nasty right now."""
01:48:42;01:48:44;"That's just a mountain of dirty laundry there."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"Yeah, just like, ""Listen--"""
01:48:46;01:48:49;"How do you-- I don't remember how to do a Boston accent."
01:48:49;01:48:52;"""Listen, not--"" I can't do a Boston accent at all."
01:48:52;01:48:55;"I'm just going to make, like, a New York--"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"""Niall, give me a break. I grew up with five brothers."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"It's fine."""
01:48:59;01:49:01;"Then they get back there."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"Like, the bed is just covered in dirty laundry."
01:49:03;01:49:06;"And he's like, ""Uh, let me--"" And she's like, ""No more waiting."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Get on the bed. Get on the bed, Niall."""
01:49:08;01:49:11;"But it's dripping with sweat, the dirty laundry."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"No, it's because they're making out getting hot and heavy,"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"so they're sweating-- On the dirty laundry."
01:49:15;01:49:18;"--onto his bed covered in dirty laundry."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"Further soiling the dirty laundry."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"That's right."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"They love dirty laundry."
01:49:25;01:49:28;"I'm sorry. I've got a sweating problem."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Niall, it's dirty laundry. You're going to wash it later. Who cares?"
01:49:30;01:49:36;"And then Ed Sheeran busts in with Chinese food grease all over his T-shirt."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Chinese food all on his beard."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"Does he have a beard?"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Mild beard. Sometimes he has a beard. He grows it out."
01:49:42;01:49:47;"Well, Ed Sheeran's working on his music from Big Pink Nantucket album."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"Everybody's on Nantucket."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"He grew the beard out. He's looking like Will Oldham."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"He's lost. He's bald."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"This is like in ten years."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Ed Sheeran's bald with a huge beard."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Chinese food up in the beard."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"You just got it on the house with Niall and Harry."
01:50:01;01:50:05;"He's put in a few hours down at Jake's hardware store."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"He's building a hardware supply."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"But seriously, Jake."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Let's get serious."
01:50:10;01:50:17;"You know, we joke around a lot on this show, but as somebody who often feels disconnected from modern pop music."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"I don't even know if I do anymore."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"Because I do the strawberry tweaks with you, I feel like I kind of know it now."
01:50:23;01:50:24;"Okay, I'm just saying."
01:50:24;01:50:32;"Do you appreciate knowing that one of the dudes from One Direction is nodding to Henley?"
01:50:32;01:50:33;"Do you like that?"
01:50:33;01:50:36;"Abstract, I think it is kind of funny and interesting."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"The song is not a payoff at all."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"But the concept is funny."
01:50:43;01:50:51;"Look at him bring that guitar out so distant."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Yeah."
01:50:52;01:50:59;"Listen to the way they're cutting off the vocals."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Interesting."
01:51:01;01:51:04;"You know what I hate?"
01:51:04;01:51:05;"That is weird."
01:51:05;01:51:08;"That's his nod to Yeezus."
01:51:08;01:51:13;"He's like, ""Guys, I have a really ambitious vision."
01:51:13;01:51:19;"I want to combine Kanye, Yeezus period with early 80s Don Henley."""
01:51:28;01:51:31;"Working at the hardware store."
01:51:31;01:51:39;"Maybe a little bit of 80s Stephen would in there too."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Yeah, a little bit."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Valerie!"
01:51:42;01:51:52;"It's been a real joy to see all the 1D guys spread their wings."
01:51:52;01:52:01;"Start referencing T-Rex, Bowie, modern R&B, old R&B, Don Henley."
01:52:01;01:52:06;"On this show, we've only ever talked about the three dudes who have pursued solo careers"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"with the most vigor."
01:52:08;01:52:12;"Zayn, Niall, and Harry."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"But there's two other guys."
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Who are they?"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"One of them's name is Liam."
01:52:18;01:52:21;"I saw he was in the news recently because he had a baby."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Oh!"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"And then there's a fifth guy."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"Anybody in the room know the fifth guy's name?"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"Brandon."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Then there's Brandon."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Wait, come on."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"Tyler?"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"No, they're English."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Travis."
01:52:34;01:52:37;"These are like, they're not from like rural Michigan."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"Kevin."
01:52:38;01:52:47;"I actually want to form the rural Michigan One Direction."
01:52:47;01:52:50;"Actually, Jake, maybe this is a business opportunity."
01:52:50;01:52:56;"These guys are showing that boy bands and Tasteful Palette of 70s rock are not miles apart."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"We should be scouring."
01:52:57;01:52:58;"We should produce."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"We should be scouring rural Michigan."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"Oh."
01:53:01;01:53:05;"To put together like a Tasteful 70s Palette boy band."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Okay, who's the fifth guy?"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Louis."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"So there's two guys left who haven't really stepped out solo."
01:53:12;01:53:18;"Obviously, they can't do the Zayn modern R&B or the Bowie thing or the..."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"They're going to go more like Slayer, Rain and Blood."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"Oh, one of them could do metal."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"That'd be sick."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"Just 80s speed metal."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"That would be sick."
01:53:27;01:53:30;"Yeah, kind of like when Lady Gaga played Metallica, that type of thing."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"And then the last guy could do..."
01:53:32;01:53:36;"Honestly, if I was like the last dude from one day, I would do kind of like Pat Metheny"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"group instrumental jazz."
01:53:39;01:53:43;"I'd be like, yeah, all right, you've heard all of these guys sing and sing about this"
01:53:43;01:53:49;"and that, having sex on dirty clothes, having sex on a pillow, having sex..."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"The back of a pickup."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"Yeah, whatever."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"I'm not going to sing about..."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"Killing babies."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Wait, what?"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"That's the weird Slayer version."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"Oh, right."
01:53:59;01:54:05;"I think the fifth guy should just be like Tasteful jazz fusion."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Down."
01:54:06;01:54:11;"Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Two last things I want to say."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Okay."
01:54:14;01:54:19;"The movie where you're a hardware store owning widower trying to reconnect with your chain"
01:54:19;01:54:25;"smokers loving daughter on Ntuket, where they come to work on their comeback One Direction"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"album, it's called New Directions."
01:54:27;01:54:31;"And it's like you sitting with the guys and the tagline is sometimes help comes where"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"you least expect it."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Yeah."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"New Directions."
01:54:35;01:54:38;"And then I rip a solo over all of their songs."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"That's the end."
01:54:39;01:54:43;"The end is like summer's coming to an end and they're just like, you're like, all right,"
01:54:43;01:54:46;"guys, are you going to keep working on the hardware store through autumn?"
01:54:46;01:54:49;"And they're just like, Jake, we got to go on tour."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"We sold out Wembley Stadium."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Our album's coming out next week."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"Our album's coming out September 8th."
01:54:54;01:55:01;"And you're like, oh, well, I gotta say it's been nice knowing you boys."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"I guess I probably won't be seeing around Ntuket too much."
01:55:04;01:55:07;"They're like, are you kidding, Jake?"
01:55:07;01:55:11;"We need you to rip a solo at Wembley."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Just throw me a guitar."
01:55:12;01:55:15;"I'm going on tour, man."
01:55:15;01:55:21;"And then I'm ripping a solo on every single one of their songs."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"And then your daughter is so impressed."
01:55:23;01:55:27;"She's like, I'll work at the hardware store."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Her dreams are crushed."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:55:29;01:55:30;"And somehow I accept that."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"And I'm like, yeah, OK, well, actually, this works out."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"I'm going on tour."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"So if you want to take over the store for the next three years,"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"we're doing a global album cycle."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"Dad, I know things have been kind of weird since we lost mom,"
01:55:42;01:55:46;"but seeing the way that you reconnected with Niall and Harry from 1D"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"made me want to reconnect with you too."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"I'm not going to college in Boston anymore."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"I'm going to go to University of Ntuket."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"And you're just like, sick."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Perfect."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Just remember to turn the lights off every day."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"You have the keys."
01:55:58;01:56:01;"I'm going on tour with them."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"Here's the inventory clipboard."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"Get working."
01:56:03;01:56:08;"All right, well, this has been a hell of a time crisis."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"A shout out."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"I think the real MVP of this episode was Niall Horan."
01:56:12;01:56:16;"Because his first single, you don't even remember it."
01:56:16;01:56:19;"But it's very inoffensive, but it doesn't have as much flavor as this one."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"This gave us a lot more to talk about."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"So I appreciate that."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Shout out to Niall."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"To everybody else who's out there, keep doing what you're doing."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"Keep surviving."
01:56:28;01:56:31;"This is our first summer under Trump."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:56:32;01:56:36;"Summer is a great time to get out there with your friends."
01:56:36;01:56:39;"You've been studying up all winter long."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Let's get out there."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"This is the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love."
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Oh, man."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"Summer of Love, part two."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Actually, part three."
01:56:46;01:56:50;"Can't forget about the-- what was it, 1987?"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"In England?"
01:56:52;01:56:53;"What?"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"OK, we're going to talk about that some other time."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"We're closing strong here."
01:56:56;01:56:59;"Summer of Love, part three."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"Shout out to everybody on Nantucket."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"I'd like to get out to Nantucket this summer."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Maybe we should do a little Summer of Love event."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Thanks for listening to Time Crisis."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:57:08;01:57:12;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"One."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"(explosion)"
