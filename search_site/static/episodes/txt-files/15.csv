01:39;01:39;"We're back."
01:39;01:42;"My name is Ezra Kainey."
01:42;01:46;"I'm a musician, primarily known for my work"
01:46;01:48;"with the group Vampire Weekend."
01:48;01:49;"And I'm here with my good buddy and co-host,"
01:49;01:50;"Jake Longstreth."
01:50;01:51;"What's up, Jake?"
01:51;01:52;"- Hey, man."
01:52;01:53;"How are you?"
01:53;01:54;"- Good, it's been a while."
01:54;01:56;"- Yeah, it's April."
01:56;01:58;"It's been a solid three months"
01:58;02:00;"since there was a new Time Crisis."
02:00;02:01;"- Yeah."
02:01;02:04;"- For people who are not familiar with Time Crisis,"
02:04;02:08;"you can go back and listen to the first 13 episodes."
02:08;02:11;"But basically it's a show where we play some music."
02:11;02:12;"- Talk music."
02:12;02:14;"- We talk music."
02:14;02:15;"But you know, we also talk about"
02:15;02:18;"what's happening in the world increasingly."
02:18;02:19;"- Yeah, big year this year."
02:19;02:22;"- Jake and I both have backgrounds in music."
02:22;02:24;"Jake is primarily a visual artist."
02:24;02:25;"- Yeah."
02:25;02:26;"- So I know we'll be bringing"
02:26;02:27;"that kind of artsy perspective."
02:27;02:28;"- Yeah."
02:28;02:29;"- Let's put a pin in that."
02:29;02:30;"Play some music."

04:27;04:30;"- Today, we're gonna be talking a lot about politics,"
04:30;04:32;"I think, or at least about the election,"
04:32;04:33;"because you know what?"
04:33;04:36;"We got the rest of the year to kind of talk about music,"
04:36;04:40;"but the primary is in full swing now."
04:40;04:40;"- Yeah."
04:40;04:43;"- A lot of emotions are happening."
04:43;04:44;"We gotta like find out how people feel."
04:44;04:47;"And I guess we gotta give people full disclosure"
04:47;04:51;"that you and I are both bros who support Bernie."
04:51;04:52;"Are we Bernie bros?"
04:52;04:53;"We'll find out later."
04:53;04:55;"We're gonna get into that."
04:55;04:57;"So of course, we're gonna be a little bit biased"
04:57;05:00;"towards Bernie, but I'd like to think"
05:00;05:02;"that we can do it in a respectful manner."
05:02;05:03;"- Absolutely."
05:03;05:06;"- That's been one of the major talking points"
05:06;05:07;"this campaign."
05:07;05:10;"Are Bernie supporters just a pack of animals?"
05:10;05:12;"I'd like to think that we're not."
05:12;05:13;"And you know, and beyond that,"
05:13;05:15;"we didn't just support Bernie."
05:15;05:18;"You and I were there on stage with him,"
05:18;05:21;"Iowa City, the primary kickoff,"
05:21;05:23;"singing ""This Land is Your Land."""
05:23;05:24;"- That was incredible."
05:24;05:25;"- That was fun."
05:25;05:26;"But you know what?"
05:26;05:27;"We gotta make sure that we see beyond the cult"
05:27;05:28;"of personality."
05:28;05:29;"It's very dangerous."
05:29;05:30;"- Yeah."
05:30;05:33;"And I think it's a criticism that people"
05:33;05:34;"lob at Bernie supporters."
05:34;05:35;"- Right, and it's possible,"
05:35;05:40;"because I understand why people are attracted"
05:40;05:43;"to that kind of charismatic politician."
05:43;05:44;"You and I were there."
05:44;05:45;"It's right before the Iowa primary."
05:45;05:48;"We're there in a big gym."
05:48;05:50;"We get to announce Bernie."
05:50;05:53;"The man comes out, crowd goes wild."
05:53;05:54;"People are just chanting."
05:54;05:56;"They know his catchphrases."
05:56;05:57;"Everybody's psyched."
05:57;05:59;"Oh, Bernie also, when he came out,"
05:59;06:02;"he said, ""Thank you, Ezra and Vampire Weekend."
06:02;06:07;"I got to hear my first name from the lips of a great man."""
06:07;06:10;"Of course, it was exciting."
06:10;06:13;"- You believe he would be the best president"
06:13;06:18;"and that his policies would be best for the country, right?"
06:18;06:20;"- Yes, I believe that."
06:20;06:25;"- So what if someone without his gravitas"
06:25;06:27;"and charisma and authenticity"
06:27;06:30;"was putting forth those exact same policies?"
06:30;06:32;"- I'd like to think that I'd still be down."
06:32;06:33;"- Yeah."
06:33;06:33;"- So I want to talk about the origins"
06:33;06:36;"of the word charisma, Jake, if you don't mind."
06:36;06:40;"I'm on the Wikipedia for charisma."
06:40;06:44;"And the term charisma has two senses."
06:44;06:47;"One, compelling attractiveness or charm"
06:47;06:49;"that can inspire devotion in others."
06:49;06:51;"We're all familiar with that."
06:51;06:56;"Two, a divinely conferred power or talent."
06:56;06:58;"It comes from the Greek charisma,"
06:58;07:01;"which means gift of grace."
07:01;07:04;"There's almost like a supernatural element"
07:04;07:08;"that the gods gave you some special leg up."
07:08;07:10;"- Right, which obviously those two definitions"
07:10;07:12;"can be conflated."
07:12;07:14;"That's where belief comes in."
07:14;07:18;"If you're a politician or a rock star,"
07:18;07:20;"it's so charismatic that,"
07:20;07:22;"or they can be so charismatic"
07:22;07:23;"that you start to believe in them."
07:23;07:25;"- Right."
07:25;07:30;"They're saying one of the OG charismatic people"
07:30;07:32;"was Paul the Apostle."
07:32;07:38;"He was bestowed the gift of God's grace."
07:38;07:39;"- Oh, okay."
07:39;07:43;"- So when we find somebody charismatic,"
07:43;07:45;"it's not just that we think they're great."
07:45;07:47;"We almost believe there's something bigger than them."
07:47;07:48;"- Yeah."
07:48;07:49;"- And I think it holds true today."
07:49;07:50;"- Yeah, absolutely."
07:50;07:52;"- But what is that bigger thing?"
07:52;07:55;"- In Bernie's case or in general?"
07:55;07:56;"- I guess in any case."
07:56;07:59;"There's another phrase that I've always been fascinated by."
07:59;08:02;"Have we talked about this, burging?"
08:02;08:03;"- No."
08:03;08:06;"- B-I-R-G, it stands for basking in reflected glory."
08:06;08:08;"It kind of describes the phenomenon of like,"
08:08;08:12;"say, getting your ego tied up in like a sports team."
08:12;08:13;"Sports team won."
08:13;08:14;"- We won."
08:14;08:15;"- We won."
08:15;08:16;"- Yeah."
08:16;08:19;"- Sports team loses, maybe you do the opposite."
08:19;08:21;"Corfing, cutting off reflected failure."
08:21;08:24;"So this is like such a big part of it, burging."
08:24;08:27;"Are we burging in Bernie?"
08:27;08:28;"- Huh, who's we?"
08:28;08:31;"I mean, maybe the people that would be called"
08:31;08:32;"Bernie bros are."
08:32;08:34;"People that get, I mean."
08:34;08:35;"- I wanna keep coming back to this though."
08:35;08:36;"Are we Bernie bros?"
08:36;08:38;"- If it gets too emotional and you're investing"
08:38;08:41;"like this insane amount of your identity into it"
08:41;08:43;"and you're getting into like Facebook arguments with people."
08:43;08:44;"- Yeah."
08:44;08:45;"- Yeah, maybe you're burging."
08:45;08:49;"- I mean, I feel bad when I see Bernie lose."
08:49;08:51;"Does that make me a piece of shit?"
08:51;08:53;"- I feel like the classic thing that people will talk about"
08:53;08:55;"is that people only pay attention every four years"
08:55;08:56;"when it's like the big show."
08:56;08:58;"- Oh yeah, I'm guilty of that."
08:58;08:59;"- Yeah."
08:59;09:00;"- I guess I can say I'm a piece of shit"
09:00;09:01;"when it comes to that."
09:01;09:03;"How come I haven't been out there voting"
09:03;09:07;"for Green Party candidates in my local elections?"
09:07;09:08;"- Right."
09:08;09:09;"- How come you aren't or are you?"
09:09;09:10;"- No, I'm not."
09:10;09:12;"I had to actually look up."
09:12;09:12;"I was like, you know what?"
09:12;09:14;"Like during all this stuff the last few months,"
09:14;09:15;"I was like, you know what?"
09:15;09:18;"This is pathetic, but I don't even know"
09:18;09:21;"who the US representative is for where I live is."
09:21;09:23;"It's Xavier Becerra."
09:23;09:26;"- And you don't know him?"
09:26;09:28;"- No, I never heard his name before."
09:28;09:29;"- That's crazy how--"
09:29;09:30;"- And he's been in Congress for like 20 years."
09:30;09:32;"I don't even, I mean like it's funny too"
09:32;09:34;"'cause like I drive around, I listen to NPR."
09:34;09:35;"- Right."
09:35;09:36;"- I kind of tune in and out of like local news."
09:36;09:39;"I'm sort of like, how have I never heard that name?"
09:39;09:40;"- I'm glad that we're having this conversation"
09:40;09:43;"because there is definitely an element,"
09:43;09:45;"a piece of shit element to us."
09:45;09:48;"I wouldn't think it was fair for somebody else to say that,"
09:48;09:50;"but I think upon self-reflection,"
09:50;09:53;"we can identify that we're a kind of piece of shit."
09:53;09:56;"But that's a lot to chew on."
09:56;09:56;"- Let's do some tunes."
09:56;09:58;"- Let's do some tunes."
09:58;09:59;"- I think we need a feel good tune"
09:59;10:03;"because I think I wanna just pick feel good music today"
10:03;10:05;"because we're gonna be talking about"
10:05;10:09;"some really difficult country dividing issues today."
10:09;10:12;"So I wanted the music to in contrast be kind of feel good."
10:12;10:14;"How about a dead tune, Jake?"
10:14;10:16;"- Ooh, I like that."
10:16;10:17;"How about Ship of Fools?"

13:59;14:02;"is you and I both have a real interest"
14:02;14:04;"in health and fitness."
14:04;14:07;"And I think that should be a bigger part of ""Time Crisis."""
14:07;14:09;"Because the truth is, a lot of people listen to ""Time Crisis"""
14:09;14:14;"as normal people, not juice heads, not fitness freaks."
14:14;14:17;"And I think it's important for us"
14:17;14:18;"to have these conversations."
14:18;14:22;"So one of my latest obsessions has been counting my steps."
14:22;14:23;"- On your phone."
14:23;14:24;"- On my phone."
14:24;14:25;"Do you count your steps?"
14:25;14:26;"- Nope."
14:26;14:27;"I have an iPhone 4."
14:27;14:29;"- Oh, so it's not even possible?"
14:29;14:29;"- Nope."
14:29;14:30;"- So, oh, we can't even look?"
14:30;14:34;"- I'm still running a 2012 OS on it."
14:34;14:34;"- That's crazy."
14:34;14:35;"- Yeah."
14:35;14:37;"- So you can't even download apps or anything?"
14:37;14:38;"- No, not anymore."
14:38;14:40;"- How do you get your Seamless?"
14:40;14:41;"- What is that?"
14:41;14:43;"(laughs)"
14:43;14:46;"- Seamless is an app that lets you order food"
14:46;14:49;"from local restaurants without having to talk on the phone."
14:49;14:50;"- Oh."
14:50;14:54;"No, I call people on the phone and order food sometimes."
14:54;14:55;"- What about Uber?"
14:55;14:56;"- Don't have it."
14:56;14:57;"Can't have it."
14:57;14:58;"- Lyft?"
14:58;14:58;"- Don't have it."
14:58;15:00;"- The one for helicopters?"
15:00;15:01;"- Don't have it."
15:01;15:02;"I have Instagram."
15:02;15:03;"- How do you get around?"
15:03;15:06;"- Hannah, my girlfriend, has Uber."
15:06;15:07;"- What about when you're by yourself?"
15:07;15:09;"- It's actually been an issue a few times."
15:09;15:11;"And she's been like, ""You need to get a new phone."""
15:11;15:12;"- 'Cause you're, are you--"
15:12;15:14;"- I need a new Apple product phone."
15:14;15:16;"- Do you still call car services?"
15:16;15:17;"- I had to go to the airport recently"
15:17;15:19;"and I used a traditional shuttle"
15:19;15:21;"where I get picked up and there are other people."
15:21;15:23;"- How much does that cost?"
15:23;15:26;"- Ran me 35 from Highland Park to LAX."
15:26;15:28;"- That doesn't even sound like such a good deal."
15:28;15:29;"35?"
15:29;15:30;"- Well, well."
15:30;15:32;"- What would an UberX have been?"
15:32;15:33;"50?"
15:33;15:34;"- Wait, is X the shared one?"
15:34;15:35;"- No."
15:35;15:36;"Oh my God."
15:36;15:37;"- No."
15:37;15:38;"- Well, you know, this is also--"
15:38;15:39;"- Okay, Uber--"
15:39;15:39;"- This is educational for the listeners."
15:39;15:41;"- Uber would have been like 60, dude."
15:41;15:41;"I've done it."
15:41;15:44;"UberX is the cheapest solo Uber."
15:44;15:45;"- Okay."
15:45;15:47;"- And I just wanna say, that's what I use all the time."
15:47;15:49;"I'm just a normal guy."
15:49;15:49;"I use UberX."
15:49;15:51;"- You're repping for it."
15:51;15:53;"- Unless I'm going maybe to a black tie event."
15:53;15:54;"- Then what do you do?"
15:54;15:55;"The SUV?"
15:55;15:57;"- I might get Uber black."
15:57;15:58;"- Is that a thing?"
15:58;15:59;"- Yeah."
15:59;16:02;"- I didn't know there were so many brand distinctions."
16:02;16:03;"- Oh yeah, because they have it"
16:03;16:06;"for all different price points."
16:06;16:06;"The one thing I will say--"
16:06;16:07;"- Well, this is fascinating."
16:07;16:08;"- The one thing that I will say that I don't like"
16:08;16:10;"about Uber is the surge pricing."
16:10;16:11;"- That seems harsh."
16:11;16:12;"Are you familiar with it?"
16:12;16:14;"- Yeah, I'm familiar with it as a concept."
16:14;16:16;"It seems just brutal."
16:16;16:18;"- It seems un-American to me"
16:18;16:24;"that a company can essentially create a monopoly"
16:24;16:30;"and then use that to manipulate the price."
16:30;16:31;"- Well--"
16:31;16:32;"- Or am I tripping?"
16:32;16:32;"- You're tripping because listen to this."
16:32;16:33;"- Why?"
16:33;16:35;"- Okay, taxi cabs we know are terrible"
16:35;16:37;"and they're really expensive and they're regulated"
16:37;16:40;"and then Uber is sort of like the neoliberal"
16:40;16:41;"free market answer to that."
16:41;16:42;"- Right."
16:42;16:43;"- In which it's completely unregulated."
16:43;16:44;"- Yeah."
16:44;16:46;"- And so you get the benefits of that"
16:46;16:48;"which are cheaper prices when it's chill."
16:48;16:49;"- Right."
16:49;16:51;"- And then when demand is high, you're gonna pay more."
16:51;16:51;"- All right, counter--"
16:51;16:52;"- That's the flip side."
16:52;16:55;"- Well, counterpoint, post-World War II, Vienna."
16:55;16:56;"- Here we go."
16:56;16:57;"- Let's take it back."
16:57;17:02;"A city destroyed by man's inhumanity to his fellow man."
17:02;17:05;"You had a lot of people jacking up prices"
17:05;17:09;"in the black market for basic goods."
17:09;17:10;"- Yeah."
17:10;17:14;"- And that was very illegal because our society says"
17:14;17:18;"that to jack up prices for a can of beans"
17:18;17:20;"when people are living--"
17:20;17:21;"- Hand to mouth."
17:21;17:25;"- In poverty, hand to mouth is deeply immoral."
17:25;17:26;"- That's a fair argument."
17:26;17:28;"I'm just saying like the flip side of that is"
17:28;17:29;"then you're gonna pay more--"
17:29;17:30;"- On average."
17:30;17:33;"- On average for a taxi cab that's regulated."
17:33;17:35;"- Is Uber unsocialist?"
17:35;17:37;"- Yeah, Uber is like the most straight up"
17:37;17:39;"capitalist thing ever."
17:39;17:41;"Like all their employees are freelancers."
17:41;17:42;"- Yeah."
17:42;17:44;"- You know, there's no like health benefits."
17:44;17:45;"It's all just sort of--"
17:45;17:46;"- Oh, this is a disaster."
17:46;17:47;"- It's all, I mean people hate--"
17:47;17:48;"- Okay, now we're taking full circle."
17:48;17:50;"- People hate on Uber."
17:50;17:52;"- We gotta get Bernie in office, man."
17:52;17:54;"- All right, now--"
17:54;17:57;"- Hillary wants to regulate Uber and Airbnb."
17:57;17:58;"- Oh, really?"
17:58;17:59;"- Mm-hmm."
17:59;18:00;"I don't know what Bernie's stance is,"
18:00;18:01;"but I remember hearing that"
18:01;18:02;"and I think that was interesting."
18:02;18:06;"- Sidebar, I would love to find out"
18:06;18:08;"who owns a piece of Uber."
18:08;18:09;"- Yeah."
18:09;18:11;"- If we get a list, we might find out that like--"
18:11;18:13;"- Bruce Willis went in on Uber."
18:13;18:15;"- Bruce Willis might own a big piece of Uber,"
18:15;18:19;"like Jay-Z, in fact, I bet you,"
18:19;18:20;"Jay-Z probably has part of Uber."
18:20;18:23;"I would just love to see that."
18:23;18:25;"I would love to know when I'm using an app"
18:25;18:27;"whose pockets I'm lining."
18:27;18:30;"If it's Bruce Willis and Jay-Z, I'm done."
18:30;18:31;"- Yeah."
