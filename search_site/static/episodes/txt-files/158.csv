00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:06;"Why are you on Facebook?"
00:06;00:09;"Why aren't you?"
00:09;00:11;"We want to know."
00:11;00:19;"On today's episode, we talk to Steve Dildarian, creator of 10 Year Old Tom and the Life of Times of Tim."
00:19;00:26;"All that, plus new music from Ed Sheeran, BTS, and Coldplay."
00:26;00:27;"This is"
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:32;"Let's begin."
00:32;00:37;"Time Crisis"
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, the war beneath, all my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a boss had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:19;01:21;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:21;01:26;"This one's a real Time Crisis. We're in so many different time zones for this ep."
01:26;01:28;"We don't have Nick yet."
01:28;01:31;"We got Jake, Seinfeld."
01:31;01:34;"Nick will be coming. People are going to be coming and going."
01:34;01:40;"We won't disclose precise locations, but there is an 11 hour spread"
01:40;01:45;"between our westernmost post and our easternmost post."
01:45;01:46;"Which I think is a record."
01:46;01:51;"Yeah, no, I think we've never done a full 11 hour. Basically, we're spanning the globe."
01:51;01:57;"The sun never sets on the Time Crisis empire."
01:57;02:02;"Well actually, before the show started, we were just talking about a friend of the show, Al D."
02:02;02:03;"True."
02:03;02:07;"Who called in from China a few eps ago. So truly, the show spans the globe."
02:07;02:08;"That's true."
02:08;02:13;"We got so much to get through. Today we got a very special guest."
02:13;02:18;"Steve Dildarian calling in later. He's got a new show called 10 Year Old Tom."
02:18;02:22;"Some of you might know him from his older show, The Life and Times of Tim."
02:22;02:26;"Before we get to that, man, there's a lot going on with Facebook."
02:26;02:30;"I mean, it's funny. We planned on talking about Facebook on this episode"
02:30;02:34;"just because we got a great email from a listener."
02:34;02:39;"But it seems like Facebook's been in the news a lot. I haven't even been following it that much."
02:39;02:43;"Seinfeld, I know I didn't give you a heads up, but you are kind of our go-to guy."
02:43;02:47;"You're our social media guy. What's going on with Facebook? They're getting hacked."
02:47;02:53;"Hey, what's up? Yeah, so there was a whistleblower, a Facebook whistleblower,"
02:53;03:01;"who appeared on 60 Minutes a few days ago to essentially reveal a lot of the dark truths"
03:01;03:07;"behind the network that we all rely on and also Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook also owns."
03:07;03:14;"And long story short, there was a lot of problematic stuff about international conflicts"
03:14;03:21;"and also things like young people's body issues, mental health stuff."
03:21;03:30;"That Facebook, the company, was very aware of as far as creating a divisive atmosphere"
03:30;03:33;"and they weren't being transparent about."
03:33;03:40;"So this whistleblower, she went on 60 Minutes to sort of blow the lid off of this sort of like"
03:40;03:47;"what we already knew, but what she'd actually collected documentation of while working at Facebook."
03:47;03:53;"Then she appeared in front of Congress or the Senate. She was at one of those trials where like..."
03:53;04:01;"This is why people listen to Time Crisis, to get the news in a timely fashion."
04:01;04:05;"Yeah. Wait, is that what... I've never actually listened to that podcast, The Daily,"
04:05;04:09;"but people always talk... Is the point of The Daily that it's like your daily dose of news?"
04:09;04:13;"No, it's like this. It's like what we're doing right now."
04:13;04:17;"It's like Time Crisis. Talking over a poor internet connection."
04:17;04:21;"Is this a couple of guys at the New York Times and just one of them being like,"
04:21;04:25;"""Hey, I heard there was like some sh*t about Joe Biden. What's going on?"""
04:25;04:29;"The other guy's like, ""Hold on. Let me get up the New York Times homepage."
04:29;04:36;"You're probably talking about the infrastructure bill. Oh yeah, I heard something about that."""
04:36;04:39;"Yeah, it's a lot of real-time Googling and just sort of skimming headlines"
04:39;04:41;"while trying to get the facts straight."
04:41;04:43;"We're the bi-weekly, not The Daily."
04:43;04:48;"Yeah, exactly. And I feel like we're more accurate than any of those news sites."
04:48;04:52;"Yeah, because... Yeah, I'm sorry. You know, I want to talk about misinformation."
04:52;04:55;"The Daily, you don't need to know about stuff daily."
04:55;05:00;"That's how you get misinformation. You need minimum two weeks for the dust to settle"
05:00;05:05;"and then for strong analytical minds to come in and look through the rubble"
05:05;05:09;"and give you the real story. Anybody who tells you they're giving you the news daily"
05:09;05:12;"is a lot of smoke and mirrors, folks. Sorry to say."
05:12;05:15;"No, that's exactly right. But then compounding all of this,"
05:15;05:20;"Facebook on Monday completely shut down."
05:20;05:22;"There was some sort of, like, I don't understand it."
05:22;05:25;"There was some kind of hack or something, but also Instagram was down."
05:25;05:30;"The entire Facebook suite of products went off the grid."
05:30;05:32;"And so, you know..."
05:32;05:33;"For how long?"
05:33;05:36;"I think it was about a full 12-hour day."
05:36;05:39;"By the evening, they had gotten back online."
05:39;05:43;"And, you know, they made some excuse about we were porting over something or whatever."
05:43;05:47;"But personally, I think someone hacked them and they just don't want to be like"
05:47;05:49;"we are vulnerable to that kind of hack."
05:49;05:52;"It's just a coincidence that this whistle was blown."
05:52;05:53;"Exactly."
05:53;05:56;"I don't know. I got to look into this a little bit."
05:56;05:59;"But I just feel like, based on what you're telling me,"
05:59;06:02;"anything that starts on 60 Minutes, no disrespect to the program,"
06:02;06:04;"but, you know, that's like big time."
06:04;06:07;"It's like when they start showing the UFO footage."
06:07;06:09;"Jake and I, we talked about this a bit."
06:09;06:13;"But, you know, when they're launching the kind of UFO footage on 60 Minutes,"
06:13;06:15;"you're already kind of like, all right, this is..."
06:15;06:17;"We're not getting the real stuff."
06:17;06:18;"You know what I mean?"
06:18;06:20;"That story really faded hard, didn't it?"
06:20;06:24;"Remember, they were like, oh, we're going to release all this UFO stuff in May."
06:24;06:27;"May of 2021 or June or whatever it was."
06:27;06:30;"And then it was like a lot of anticipation and build up to that story."
06:30;06:33;"And then it was a whole pot of nothing."
06:33;06:34;"It's a real nothing burger."
06:34;06:39;"But, you know, 60 Minutes, in the lead up to that big document drop,"
06:39;06:41;"they were getting big ratings."
06:41;06:42;"Right."
06:42;06:44;"Yeah, there was a lot of hype leading up to the dock drop."
06:44;06:47;"And 60 Minutes was like, we're going to do a show right before the dock drop"
06:47;06:51;"that we're going to basically speculate wildly, time crisis style,"
06:51;06:54;"on what is in the dock and nothing's in there."
06:54;06:55;"Oh, boy."
06:55;06:57;"They just hit us with the grainy footage."
06:57;06:58;"Just like, oh, that's something."
06:58;07:00;"Come on, let us see the real stuff."
07:40;07:56;"But anyway, long before this whistleblower is out there telling us stuff"
07:56;07:59;"that sounds like everybody already knew,"
07:59;08:04;"which is basically that people say wild stuff on social media."
08:04;08:09;"And there is not and never will be a true mechanism to sort through it,"
08:09;08:11;"because it's impossible."
08:11;08:14;"And it's rough on impressionable, vulnerable minds."
08:14;08:19;"And I guess is the scandal that it's sort of like the cigarette companies"
08:19;08:22;"for decades were like, smoking's not bad for you."
08:22;08:25;"But it turns out they knew the whole time it was."
08:25;08:29;"Is it sort of like Facebook is like, ooh, publicly,"
08:29;08:31;"they're like, everything's cool."
08:31;08:33;"We're just a content platform."
08:33;08:36;"And then behind closed doors, they're like, man, maybe this is messed up."
08:36;08:39;"Is that the whistleblower?"
08:39;08:43;"I get the sense that it's a little bit more nuanced, less cut and dry."
08:43;08:46;"Because I think there were some acknowledgment that, OK,"
08:46;08:47;"we're working on it."
08:47;08:50;"We know there's harassment, but we're going to fix it."
08:50;08:55;"But then she collected all these documents that were very like,"
08:55;08:56;"this is a problem."
08:56;08:59;"And there are a couple of things like, did you know that Instagram"
08:59;09:02;"was working on an Instagram for kids?"
09:02;09:03;"Oh, yeah, that was out."
09:03;09:04;"Didn't know."
09:04;09:09;"That was an initiative that to capitalize on the sort of preteen market,"
09:09;09:13;"they were going to do a different version of Instagram for kids."
09:13;09:17;"That was sort of like, at the same time, conflicting with this research"
09:17;09:21;"that they had done internally that was like, oh, Instagram is actually"
09:21;09:25;"quite bad for kids and young girls, especially."
09:25;09:28;"I guess the thing that confuses me is like, all this stuff is bad"
09:28;09:30;"for human beings."
09:30;09:32;"What was that old kind of like hippie poster that's like,"
09:32;09:37;"nuclear war is bad for adults, children, and all human beings?"
09:37;09:38;"Let me look this up."
09:38;09:41;"I mean, the other thing that stood out was like, apparently,"
09:41;09:46;"Facebook is set up in a lot of countries where they haven't put"
09:46;09:52;"the proper staffing in place so that like more vulnerable nations"
09:52;09:56;"can take advantage of it as a means of communication that can then,"
09:56;09:59;"you know, and here's where I get a little hazy on it,"
09:59;10:03;"but can kind of like lead to a lot of strife and like conflict"
10:03;10:06;"because there's no moderation happening."
10:06;10:08;"So that was one of the big things that they've done,"
10:08;10:10;"that it was like very geopolitically."
10:10;10:12;"I'm sure it's a real slippery slope with moderation, though,"
10:12;10:14;"because it's like, who's moderating?"
10:14;10:19;"The thing I was thinking of is this is a classic old hippie poster."
10:19;10:24;"It's kind of handwritten with like this kind of flower looking thing,"
10:24;10:29;"and it says nuclear power is not healthy for children and other living things,"
10:29;10:32;"which kind of debatable these days."
10:32;10:34;"Occasionally, you talk to people who are just like,"
10:34;10:37;"nuclear power is the only thing that's going to save us,"
10:37;10:38;"so the hippies got to lighten up on that."
10:38;10:42;"I don't know enough to have a full point of view, but yeah,"
10:42;10:45;"I think it's similar that I can imagine people being more up in arms"
10:45;10:50;"about Instagram for children, and I'm sure Instagram is not healthy"
10:50;10:55;"for children and other living things, which is probably true of Facebook,"
10:55;11:00;"Twitter, even podcasts, basically everything other than internet radio."
11:00;11:04;"As we've long said, internet radio is the only ethical form of content."
11:04;11:07;"It's also the only ethical form of social media."
11:07;11:10;"I got on Instagram, I think when I was 35,"
11:10;11:12;"and I'm thankful I was that old."
11:12;11:13;"Yeah."
11:13;11:14;"Fully formed."
11:14;11:16;"That should be the cutoff."
11:16;11:17;"You can join when you're 35."
11:17;11:20;"It's like you can run for president when you're 35,"
11:20;11:21;"and you can join Instagram."
11:21;11:23;"[laughs]"
11:23;11:24;"Right."
11:24;11:27;"Yeah, that's like the classic argument of like,"
11:27;11:29;"back in the day, you couldn't even vote when you were 18,"
11:29;11:33;"so people would say like, you can send me to die in war,"
11:33;11:35;"but I can't vote?"
11:35;11:36;"That doesn't make any sense."
11:36;11:38;"And it should be like, wait a second."
11:38;11:42;"I can't even run for president, but I can use Instagram?"
11:42;11:44;"How does that make any sense?"
11:44;11:45;"Joe Biden?"
11:45;11:47;"No, no, really think about it."
11:47;11:49;"I literally cannot run for president."
11:49;11:51;"I can't be the boss of the nation,"
11:51;11:55;"and yet I can use this toxic platform?"
11:55;11:56;"That makes no sense."
11:56;11:58;"How old do you have to be to use Instagram?"
11:58;11:59;"Is there even a rule?"
11:59;12:00;"Oh, yeah."
12:00;12:01;"I think it's--"
12:01;12:03;"Guys, I would be a really good leader."
12:03;12:04;"Of this nation?"
12:04;12:05;"You got my vote."
12:05;12:07;"I would be a really good leader, guys."
12:07;12:09;"It's-- I believe it."
12:09;12:10;"It's 13."
12:10;12:12;"13, you can start an account."
12:12;12:13;"That's right."
12:13;12:15;"How do they even verify that?"
12:15;12:17;"But then you also have the phenomenon of--"
12:17;12:20;"there's parents who start Instagram accounts for their babies in utero."
12:20;12:21;"Yeah."
12:21;12:22;"That's incredibly cool."
12:22;12:23;"You know what?"
12:23;12:24;"I've long said--"
12:24;12:26;"That's incredible."
12:26;12:29;"I'm sure they have their reasons sometimes,"
12:29;12:31;"but, you know, it's funny."
12:31;12:32;"I'm sure we've had this--"
12:32;12:34;"I can't remember if we've had this privately or on the show,"
12:34;12:36;"but, you know, we're all parents here."
12:36;12:39;"We don't get into too much parenting talk on the show."
12:39;12:41;"But, you know, I understand."
12:41;12:43;"Everybody's got a different relationship with social media."
12:43;12:45;"And, of course, it's understandable."
12:45;12:49;"Some people want to have a quick way to share stuff about their kids"
12:49;12:51;"with their family and friends."
12:51;12:53;"And, you know, sometimes maybe you get--"
12:53;12:54;"I don't know about you guys."
12:54;12:56;"Maybe sometimes you get a little tired of like,"
12:56;12:59;"""Oh, I got to text this to grandma and grandpa."""
12:59;13:00;"I don't know."
13:00;13:03;"I could imagine some people being like, ""I want a one-stop shop."
13:03;13:05;"I don't like group chats,"" whatever."
13:05;13:09;"I don't judge, but I've always wondered,"
13:09;13:13;"because on the one hand, people sometimes create Instagram accounts"
13:13;13:15;"for their children or, you know, whatever."
13:15;13:17;"Again, I'm not judging."
13:17;13:19;"But on the other hand, there's this school of thought that says"
13:19;13:23;"social media will one day be looked at as cigarettes."
13:23;13:26;"Imagine if back in the '60s you had your baby smoke cigarettes."
13:26;13:28;"From the day they were born,"
13:28;13:31;"eventually some of those kids would turn around and say,"
13:31;13:35;"""Why did you make me smoke cigarettes as a baby?"""
13:35;13:37;"""I don't know. I'm suing you."""
13:37;13:39;"Or like, ""This is going to be a big problem."""
13:39;13:40;"""I don't know."""
13:40;13:41;"So I've always wondered about that."
13:41;13:44;"And, you know, it's like a dumb dinner party conversation"
13:44;13:45;"where I just always say,"
13:45;13:47;"""I wonder if that's going to be a whole thing. I don't know."""
13:47;13:49;"And I always try to be like,"
13:49;13:51;"""Hey, I don't judge, but I just wonder."""
13:51;13:53;"- A dumb dinner party."
13:53;13:56;"- Yeah, just like, ""I wonder if that'll be a thing."""
13:56;13:58;"You know, sitting next to somebody you don't know that well or whatever."
13:58;14:00;"- The future is going to be crazy, right? Huh?"
14:00;14:02;"- Yeah, I mean, because think about like,"
14:02;14:04;"when we were kids, it was pretty different."
14:04;14:05;"You know what I mean?"
14:05;14:06;"- Crazy, dude."
14:06;14:08;"- How old are you?"

15:44;15:47;"that was kind of like a speculative question."
15:47;15:48;"Yeah, we don't know."
15:48;15:49;"We don't know how people--"
15:49;15:50;"Obviously, we don't know the effect"
15:50;15:52;"that technology has on people,"
15:52;15:53;"but also we just don't know"
15:53;15:55;"what the emotional terrain will be like."
15:55;15:56;"Will people--"
15:56;15:58;"Or I've also wondered sometimes,"

38:13;38:14;"That's like--"

38:16;38:19;"- He's like the last guy they should have asked."
38:19;38:20;"Like, if you see his show--"
38:20;38:21;"- Yeah."

38:22;38:23;"at the Staples Center a few years ago."

39:54;39:57;"This is like some Travis Scott, like early on."
39:57;39:59;"It looks like it's just,"
39:59;40:01;"it's got Pink Floyd like art,"
40:01;40:03;"like decals, like burned into the,"
40:03;40:04;"oh, and in the seats too,"
40:04;40:05;"and the embroidery."
40:05;40:06;"This is."
40:06;40:07;"- Really?"
40:07;40:08;"- This is something."
40:08;40:09;"- All right."
40:09;40:10;"- Yeah, this is a trip."
40:10;40:11;"- I know what my next car is."
40:11;40:13;"- It has Pink Floyd,"
40:13;40:14;"just the words Pink Floyd,"
40:14;40:17;"like embroidered into the headrest."
40:17;40:18;"Sorry."
40:18;40:19;"- Whoa."
40:19;40:20;"- Kind of funny to see."
40:20;40:21;"- That does sound kind of early"
40:21;40:24;"for like a classic rock car collab."
40:24;40:27;"If you told me like that next year,"
40:27;40:29;"the Grateful Dead had,"
40:29;40:32;"had a, like a full on like automotive line"
40:32;40:34;"coming out with a Volkswagen,"
40:34;40:35;"I'd be like, of course,"
40:35;40:37;"there's probably a special bus"
40:37;40:41;"and probably like Mickey Hart signed the tailpipe."
40:41;40:44;"And it's probably like got a record player in it."
40:44;40:45;"Sure."
40:45;40:47;"But that is, that '94 is a little early."
40:47;40:49;"Okay, Pink Floyd were pioneers."
40:49;40:50;"I guess they keep you guessing."

42:08;42:09;"- We now got Nick."
42:09;42:11;"- Sorry for my lateness."
42:11;42:14;"- Hey teacher, leave those kids alone."
42:14;42:17;"(laughing)"
42:17;42:21;"So we've got Steve Dildaring about to call in."
42:21;42:23;"And Nick, maybe you could set him up"
42:23;42:25;"because you just worked on his new show."
42:25;42:26;"- Yeah."
42:26;42:29;"So the synergy is really happening."
42:29;42:31;"Like the world's colliding."
42:31;42:35;"Yeah, I, you know, when I'm not doing this show,"
42:35;42:39;"I make cartoons mostly and an occasional game show."
42:39;42:42;"But I started this new company"
42:42;42:45;"and the first show I did is with this guy, Steve Dildarian,"
42:45;42:50;"who made like the first, like HBO's first,"
42:50;42:53;"and I'm almost only, like they made maybe two cartoons,"
42:53;42:55;"but he had this show like 10 years ago"
42:55;42:57;"called ""The Life and Times of Tim"""
42:57;43:01;"that was like an OG adult animated show"
43:01;43:03;"that I know Matt was a big fan of."
43:03;43:06;"And I think Seinfeld, you were a big fan of."
43:06;43:08;"And it was like, you know, had like early Nick Kroll."
43:08;43:10;"Like that's actually one of the first times"
43:10;43:13;"I think I heard Nick Kroll was in that show."
43:13;43:15;"And it was, you know, so it was like these,"
43:15;43:17;"it was like very adult swimmy in a way."
43:17;43:20;"It was pretty dry and sort of had this sort of"
43:20;43:22;"monotone kind of thing,"
43:22;43:25;"but it was two 11 minute episodes that were put together."
43:25;43:28;"And it was sort of like a real culty kind of thing."
43:28;43:30;"Like there was nothing else on HBO that was like it."
43:30;43:31;"It was like late at night,"
43:31;43:33;"like maybe on like a Friday or something."
43:33;43:35;"And I loved it."
43:35;43:39;"And in fact, tried to buy it when I was at Adult Swim"
43:39;43:41;"to like keep it going or air it."
43:41;43:43;"So I met him when I was trying to like revive it"
43:43;43:45;"when it was off HBO."
43:45;43:47;"And then when I started this new thing,"
43:47;43:48;"I was introduced to him again"
43:48;43:51;"and he had this idea for a cartoon."
43:51;43:54;"He had a few, but this one sort of really struck me"
43:54;43:56;"as the most interesting,"
43:56;44:00;"but it was almost like it was the exact same show"
44:00;44:02;"as like ""Betide the Tim"""
44:02;44:05;"except if you made the main character 10 years old."
44:05;44:07;"And so I was like, well, that seems easy."
44:07;44:08;"Like I already can see it."
44:08;44:11;"It's just the younger version of that guy."
44:11;44:14;"And so we sold the show to HBO Max,"
44:14;44:16;"who were amazing and loved working with them."
44:16;44:18;"And it was cool because then they were able to get"
44:18;44:20;"""Life and Times of Tim"" and put it on with them."
44:20;44:24;"But what was crazy is the second we sold the show,"
44:24;44:28;"like literally two or three days later, COVID started."
44:28;44:32;"So we did basically every single thing in quarantine."
44:32;44:35;"And this is a guy that, and he can talk about it,"
44:35;44:37;"but like he likes to bring everybody into the booth"
44:37;44:40;"to record together, you know, like he,"
44:40;44:42;"but none of that happened, you know?"
44:42;44:44;"So literally the entire show,"
44:44;44:47;"I haven't seen him since we made the show."
44:47;44:50;"Like we've not been, for two years, you know,"
44:50;44:52;"we sold the show, we'd hung out a few times"
44:52;44:55;"and then haven't seen each other since starting."
44:55;44:59;"So he's been, I think he's still in Europe."
44:59;45:01;"Like he just like kind of also did his own thing"
45:01;45:03;"where he's like on some weird, crazy schedule"
45:03;45:05;"where he's making the show from like Scotland."
45:05;45:08;"So, well, he's been there for a while,"
45:08;45:11;"but he's, yeah, he's really a fascinating guy."
45:11;45:15;"And, you know, I think some people on here, you know,"
45:15;45:17;"really dig the show,"
45:17;45:21;"but specifically he felt like a TC guest"
45:21;45:24;"because before making the cartoon that he made,"
45:24;45:27;"he was like a big advertising dude."
45:27;45:31;"And he made his claim to fame from that I understand,"
45:31;45:32;"and we should talk to him about it,"
45:32;45:36;"is that he created the Budweiser lizards."
45:36;45:38;"- And there's definitely a few people at home saying"
45:38;45:40;"the Budweiser lizards,"
45:40;45:44;"because the lizards took over from the frogs."
45:44;45:46;"I mean, I guess we can get into that with him,"
45:46;45:48;"but it's from the same era."
45:48;45:51;"- Yeah, it's the same era, you know, the Budweiser."
45:51;45:53;"And by the way, he may have created the frog."
45:53;45:54;"I mean, I feel like-"
45:54;45:56;"- Okay, so we got a lot of questions for him."
45:56;45:57;"- Let's call him."
45:57;45:58;"- And we're going to get him to weigh in"
45:58;46:00;"on the whole Pink Floyd debacle."
46:00;46:04;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
46:04;46:07;"(phone ringing)"
46:07;46:09;"- Steve, welcome to Time Crisis."
46:09;46:11;"- Hey, thank you."
46:11;46:12;"How's it going?"
46:12;46:14;"- Great to have you on."
46:14;46:15;"- Yeah, thanks for having me."
46:15;46:16;"This is exciting."
46:16;46:20;"- You're a legend of both animation and advertising."
46:20;46:21;"- Nice."
46:21;46:24;"- So if you don't mind getting right into it,"
46:24;46:28;"I don't know if you heard about five months ago,"
46:28;46:31;"Roger Waters did a press conference"
46:31;46:34;"and he said that Facebook had reached out to him"
46:34;46:35;"because they wanted to use"
46:35;46:38;"Another Brick in the Wall Part Two"
46:38;46:40;"for a big campaign for Instagram."
46:40;46:42;"They offered him a lot of money,"
46:42;46:47;"but Roger Waters said that Zuckerberg was a little prick"
46:47;46:50;"and he said they could basically go (beep) themselves."
46:50;46:52;"So we were kind of talking about that,"
46:52;46:55;"but none of us have any real experience"
46:55;46:56;"in the advertising world."
46:56;46:59;"And as we talked about it, we just started to think,"
46:59;47:01;"what the (beep) kind of Instagram commercial"
47:01;47:02;"could use that song?"
47:02;47:05;"- These tech companies have all the money."
47:05;47:07;"That's crazy what the songs they buy."
47:07;47:09;"It's not like it was when I was doing it."
47:09;47:12;"You see them buying Rolling Stones."
47:12;47:14;"You know, there's, sky's the limit."
47:14;47:17;"I'm not surprised they could get a Pink Floyd song."
47:17;47:18;"- Well, they didn't ultimately get it"
47:18;47:20;"because I guess for Roger Waters,"
47:20;47:22;"some things are more important than money."
47:22;47:24;"But money aside,"
47:24;47:26;"so you know the song, right?"
47:26;47:27;"We Don't Need No Education."
47:27;47:29;"We Don't Need No Thought Control."
47:29;47:31;"Just off the top of your head,"
47:31;47:33;"and I know we're throwing hard balls at you"
47:33;47:34;"just as soon as you get on the phone,"
47:34;47:36;"but just off the top of your head,"
47:36;47:38;"just even, let's say they got it."
47:38;47:41;"Let's say they spent $2 million, whatever, they got it."
47:41;47:43;"How do you use that song and that sentiment"
47:43;47:45;"in an ad for Instagram?"
47:45;47:46;"- Oh, just creatively."
47:46;47:47;"That is a good question."
47:47;47:48;"- Creatively."
47:48;47:51;"- Yeah, to reverse engineer that."
47:51;47:53;"I don't know off the top of my head."
47:53;47:55;"(laughs)"
47:55;47:56;"I'm stumped."
47:56;47:57;"If this is, yeah, out of the gate,"
47:57;47:58;"you've got me stumped."
47:58;48:00;"(laughs)"
48:00;48:03;"- Hey teacher, leave those kids alone."
48:03;48:05;"(laughs)"
48:05;48:07;"- I think a lot of these tech companies"
48:07;48:11;"see themselves in that kind of renegade point of view,"
48:11;48:12;"to be honest."
48:12;48:15;"I'm sure there's no irony to it from where they stand."
48:15;48:16;"- I'm sure you're right."
48:16;48:19;"And that's probably why our cultural moment is so weird"
48:19;48:21;"is because, I don't know who said it,"
48:21;48:23;"but there's that famous quote,"
48:23;48:28;"""Nobody's as surprised as the revolutionary"
48:28;48:31;"""who finds themselves rebelled against."""
48:31;48:35;"Or the revolutionary finds themselves revolutioned against."
48:35;48:36;"And I'm sure you're right."
48:36;48:38;"All these guys who now truly are,"
48:38;48:42;"they're so much power, so in bed with the government,"
48:42;48:44;"but they probably still think of themselves"
48:44;48:48;"as some kind of badass hacker dudes."
48:48;48:50;"Yeah, that's what's confusing about it."
48:50;48:51;"- They are the wall."
48:51;48:53;"- I think I have a scenario."
48:53;48:54;"- Okay."
48:54;48:58;"- I imagine fairly often, on a daily basis,"
48:58;49:00;"kids are in school on their phones"
49:00;49:03;"and teachers are trying to get them off their phones"
49:03;49:04;"and kids are like, ""Why should..."""
49:04;49:08;"- Yes, no, no, I did a pretty similar one before."
49:08;49:10;"Basically, the teacher would say,"
49:10;49:12;"""You can't use Instagram in school,"""
49:12;49:13;"and that they would be like,"
49:13;49:15;"""Hey teacher, leave those kids alone."""
49:15;49:18;"- Let them post during class time."
49:18;49:19;"(laughs)"
49:19;49:20;"- You know what?"
49:20;49:21;"We gotta raise some money"
49:21;49:24;"and just get this commercial made."
49:24;49:25;"The world needs it."
49:25;49:27;"- How did this information get out?"
49:27;49:31;"This is public knowledge that they tried to get it and failed?"
49:31;49:33;"- Yeah, Roger Waters was doing a press conference"
49:33;49:36;"about Julian Assange and then he was like,"
49:36;49:39;"""And by the way, look at this email I got this morning,"""
49:39;49:41;"because he feels like Facebook is actually"
49:41;49:43;"an agent of censorship,"
49:43;49:45;"whereas he supports Julian Assange,"
49:45;49:47;"somebody who wants to get everything out there."
49:47;49:50;"So yeah, he wasn't down with it."
49:50;49:52;"But enough about Roger Waters and Facebook."
49:52;49:53;"(laughs)"
49:53;49:58;"Tell us about your previous life in advertising."
49:58;49:59;"How did you get into it?"
49:59;50:01;"- My claim to fame in that world"
50:01;50:03;"was doing things like talking lizards and frogs."
50:03;50:06;"So the conversation you engaged me in"
50:06;50:09;"was a little more intellectual than what I did."
50:09;50:12;"I did a lot of the Bowiser lizards back in the day"
50:12;50:15;"with the talking frogs and all,"
50:15;50:17;"which was an incredible run."
50:17;50:21;"I had a 10-year run just doing Budweiser commercials"
50:21;50:22;"and things like that."
50:22;50:23;"- Yeah, how does that even happen?"
50:23;50:26;"How do you become the Budweiser frogs guy?"
50:26;50:29;"- I knew when I was 15, I wanted to write comedy."
50:29;50:32;"It's the only thing I was better at other people,"
50:32;50:34;"better than them at."
50:34;50:36;"So I knew it was going to be comedy"
50:36;50:38;"and I just didn't see a way of moving"
50:38;50:41;"from New Jersey to LA at the time at that age."
50:41;50:43;"So New York was advertising"
50:43;50:45;"and it just seemed like an approachable kind of way"
50:45;50:48;"to do what I was trying to do."
50:48;50:51;"So I just moved 40 minutes up the turnpike"
50:51;50:53;"instead of flying across the country"
50:53;50:56;"and I started doing well at it pretty quickly."
50:56;50:58;"So yeah, from a young age,"
50:58;51:01;"I started doing commercials for Staples and Little Saints"
51:01;51:02;"and things like that."
51:02;51:06;"- So you're a funny guy, you're good at writing jokes,"
51:06;51:08;"but how do you actually go get the job?"
51:08;51:12;"You go interview at some Madison Avenue type company,"
51:12;51:15;"and you just give them a list of a bunch of jokes?"
51:15;51:17;"And they're just like, ""All right,"
51:17;51:20;"you could probably make some commercials."""
51:20;51:21;"- It's a funny thing."
51:21;51:23;"Someone was asking me about this recently."
51:23;51:25;"For me, because that business, like anyone,"
51:25;51:28;"sometimes you got to know people, which I didn't."
51:28;51:30;"No one in my family or in my world"
51:30;51:32;"was connected in any way."
51:32;51:34;"But I was lucky enough to have someone's dad"
51:34;51:36;"give me a piece of advice."
51:36;51:39;"And he said, ""If you want to get into a business,"
51:39;51:41;"just start talking to people,"
51:41;51:45;"write letters to people that do the work that you admire."""
51:45;51:46;"And that's what I did."
51:46;51:48;"I wrote like 50 letters to people"
51:48;51:50;"that were writing funny commercials in New York."
51:50;51:52;"- What era is this?"
51:52;51:54;"- This era is the '90s."
51:54;51:56;"- Like early '90s?"
51:56;51:59;"- Yeah, when you're writing letters, yeah."
51:59;52:01;"- It's 1991."
52:01;52:03;"Your friend's dad gives you some good advice."
52:03;52:05;"So he'll just give you very general advice"
52:05;52:07;"about whatever you're interested in."
52:07;52:09;"Sit your ass down, start writing letters."
52:09;52:11;"So how do you even start?"
52:11;52:13;"So you would like see something on TV"
52:13;52:16;"and you have to look up an advertising firm."
52:16;52:18;"And could you even find somebody's name?"
52:18;52:20;"- There's a book. - ""Dear Mr. Draper,"
52:20;52:22;"I will laugh my ass off"
52:22;52:26;"at the latest Pepsi commercial."""
52:26;52:28;"Yeah, I'm sorry. You're saying there's a book."
52:28;52:30;"- Yeah, there's a thing called the Red Book."
52:30;52:31;"I don't know if they still have it."
52:31;52:33;"I'm sure this stuff's all online."
52:33;52:36;"But yeah, I just found the people that wrote the things"
52:36;52:38;"and I wrote them letters."
52:38;52:42;"And all it took was for like three of those 50 to reply."
52:42;52:43;"And then I was in."
52:43;52:46;"And I'm off to the races 'cause I went into New York."
52:46;52:49;"I bought a suit. I didn't own a suit at the time."
52:49;52:52;"So I bought a suit to go in and meet this writer"
52:52;52:54;"who in retrospect is ridiculous."
52:54;52:57;"The guy was probably in his late 20s"
52:57;53:00;"writing some random TV commercials."
53:00;53:01;"And I bought a-- 'cause I didn't know any better--"
53:01;53:03;"I bought a suit to go see the guy."
53:03;53:05;"And I show up and they're like,"
53:05;53:07;"""Where are you from? What are you doing?"""
53:07;53:08;"- 'Cause these guys are just wearing like--"
53:08;53:10;"they look like TV writers or something."
53:10;53:13;"Just wearing like T-shirts and real casual."
53:13;53:15;"- Exactly, yeah. Jeans and T-shirts."
53:15;53:17;"And I walk in in my suit."
53:17;53:19;"But that's all it took was one meeting."
53:19;53:21;"And then I knew one person."
53:21;53:23;"He introduced me to two more people."
53:23;53:25;"And then once-- you know, I took night classes."
53:25;53:28;"I would drive into the city and take night classes."
53:28;53:31;"And before you know it, yeah, one thing leads to another."
53:31;53:34;"So I always feel for people when they're not part of a world"
53:34;53:35;"or part of a business."
53:35;53:37;"I know how hard it can be."
53:37;53:39;"I tried to get an internship and, you know,"
53:39;53:42;"I got rejected from every big ad agency in New York"
53:42;53:44;"rejected me just for an internship to work for free."
53:44;53:46;"- Jeez. - Yeah."
53:46;53:49;"So once I was in, things kind of happened fast."
53:49;53:51;"- Now it can be really hard to know where to begin"
53:51;53:54;"if you don't have somebody who can like really just cut through"
53:54;53:56;"and say, ""No, no, no, you don't have to do all that."
53:56;53:59;"Just talk to this person or at least go apply here."""
53:59;54:02;"So you're willing to go that hard to write 50 letters"
54:02;54:04;"and really get into this industry."
54:04;54:09;"Do you have like a story like the commercial that changed my life?"
54:09;54:11;"Not really. I got to be honest."
54:11;54:14;"When I was in high school, I wanted to write TV."
54:14;54:18;"Like I said before, that's what I really wanted to do."
54:18;54:21;"Advertising was just something I could achieve easier."
54:21;54:23;"So it's kind of like a detour."
54:23;54:25;"It ended up being like a 10-year detour that I took,"
54:25;54:26;"even though I loved it."
54:26;54:28;"What would your dream job have been?"
54:28;54:31;"Like writing for SNL or something like that?"
54:31;54:36;"Yeah, SNL I wanted to do and really sitcoms."
54:36;54:42;"I always wanted to write just comedy, character-driven comedy."
54:42;54:44;"And that's what I ended up doing in advertising."
54:44;54:48;"The stuff I did wasn't really selling stuff."
54:48;54:50;"Those Budweiser commercials were just entertainment"
54:50;54:52;"for all intents and purposes."
54:52;54:55;"So I managed to find a little corner of the industry"
54:55;54:57;"that served my purposes."
54:57;55:00;"So it sounds like this corner of the industry,"
55:00;55:02;"your colleagues, the vibe,"
55:02;55:06;"is kind of how people describe some comedy writer's room."
55:06;55:07;"Totally."
55:07;55:14;"Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A."
55:21;55:28;"I'd much rather be on a boardwalk on Broadway"
55:28;55:35;"Well I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am"
55:35;55:42;"I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am"
55:42;55:46;"I'm an under-assisted West Coast robo-man"
55:46;55:50;"All right, so now let's get to the frogs and lizards."
55:50;55:53;"I was working in New York doing like a pizza pizza,"
55:53;55:54;"Little Caesars commercials."
55:54;55:56;"That was like my first job."
55:56;55:57;"And once that did well,"
55:57;56:00;"I probably got a little too confident too quickly"
56:00;56:02;"and tried to write a novel."
56:02;56:06;"I went down to Key West and quit my job"
56:06;56:08;"and I was trying to write this novel."
56:08;56:12;"And in retrospect, I was so naive and misguided,"
56:12;56:14;"but I was very excited at the time."
56:14;56:16;"You didn't create Pizza Pizza."
56:16;56:17;"No, no, no."
56:17;56:20;"Cliff Freeman did, who sadly just passed away."
56:20;56:22;"He was like a legend in the business"
56:22;56:24;"and a huge influence on me"
56:24;56:26;"because to what you were saying just a minute ago,"
56:26;56:29;"Ezra, he created this environment"
56:29;56:33;"where nothing but comedy could come out of it."
56:33;56:35;"It was this place where everyone wanted to work."
56:35;56:37;"One of the funniest commercials on TV."
56:37;56:39;"It was a very small department, you know,"
56:39;56:40;"eight or ten writers."
56:40;56:43;"And which agency was this?"
56:43;56:45;"This is Cliff Freeman and Partners,"
56:45;56:48;"which was down on the lower west side"
56:48;56:50;"over on Hudson and Houston."
56:50;56:53;"And they were the place to be for comedy at the time."
56:53;56:55;"So once you were in there,"
56:55;56:57;"it was just this environment where it's just like"
56:57;57:00;"every person you look around was funnier than the next,"
57:00;57:03;"all doing the best commercials at the time,"
57:03;57:05;"and everyone's just making each other laugh."
57:05;57:07;"And it's just so supportive,"
57:07;57:10;"so encouraging, so inspiring."
57:10;57:14;"Nothing but great stuff could come out of that environment."
57:14;57:16;"And I always took that with me, as you know,"
57:16;57:19;"creative work in this field is less about"
57:19;57:22;"the work itself or the ideas you may have,"
57:22;57:25;"but it's giving a person that environment"
57:25;57:27;"that tees them up to succeed."
57:27;57:30;"Giving a person a support structure that,"
57:30;57:32;"you know, they can actually shine."
57:32;57:34;"Because it's easy to take a really talented person,"
57:34;57:37;"I've seen plenty of really talented people"
57:37;57:39;"fail and be frustrated and miserable"
57:39;57:41;"because the environment is wrong."
57:41;57:43;"Yeah, I'm sure."
57:43;57:44;"But you know, it's funny."
57:44;57:46;"It's like, it's kind of blowing my mind because"
57:46;57:50;"obviously there's a lot of really funny, great commercials."
57:50;57:53;"But this idea of like early 90s New York,"
57:53;57:55;"a lot of people who are interested in comedy,"
57:55;57:58;"all coming together at an ad agency"
57:58;58:00;"and being in kind of like the comedy room."
58:00;58:03;"I guess I never really had a vision that that's how it worked."
58:03;58:05;"Was that kind of unusual at Cliff Freeman?"
58:05;58:08;"No, I mean, any ad agency,"
58:08;58:11;"the creative department is its own thing."
58:11;58:14;"And that's not every agency is a creative driven agency."
58:14;58:17;"There's plenty of places making a ton of money."
58:17;58:20;"And they couldn't care less how creative the work is."
58:20;58:22;"But with, you know, the creative agencies,"
58:22;58:24;"it's this whole kind of subculture."
58:24;58:26;"It's the stuff you probably know or might like"
58:26;58:28;"or see on the Super Bowl and stuff."
58:28;58:29;"But yeah, that's very common."
58:29;58:32;"The creative department is its own little world"
58:32;58:33;"and it's a tight world."
58:33;58:37;"And there's often specifically like a kind of comedy crew."
58:37;58:40;"So like somebody gets like a really serious ad"
58:40;58:43;"and they kind of go to a different group of people"
58:43;58:45;"and then Budweiser comes through and they're like,"
58:45;58:47;"all right, let's go to the comedy crew."
58:47;58:51;"Well, it's not a comedy crew."
58:51;58:54;"It's any agency, some are known for things."
58:54;58:55;"Cliff Freeman was known for comedy."
58:55;58:56;"That's all they did."
58:56;58:59;"There was no serious person in that department."
58:59;59:00;"I see."
59:00;59:03;"So anybody, somebody who wanted to make a sentimental ad"
59:03;59:07;"for engagement rings would not go to that agency"
59:07;59:08;"in the first place."
59:08;59:09;"I see."
59:09;59:13;"But the place I went next was that kind of place,"
59:13;59:16;"Goodby Silverstein and Partners out in San Francisco."
59:16;59:18;"And they were doing Got Milk,"
59:18;59:20;"which had just come out at the time."
59:20;59:23;"They were known for serious work, funny, whatever."
59:23;59:28;"So I became one of the funny people that was put on Budweiser."
59:28;59:31;"And yeah, we sold that lizard campaign"
59:31;59:33;"that just took off on the Super Bowl."
59:33;59:36;"And that just changed the trajectory of my career"
59:36;59:38;"because I was pretty young at the time."
59:38;59:39;"But really walk us through that."
59:39;59:42;"Well, first of all, I'm getting a little confused."
59:42;59:43;"I remember the frogs."
59:43;59:44;"I remember the lizards."
59:44;59:46;"Which came first?"
59:46;59:47;"Did you work on both?"
59:47;59:50;"Yeah, that gets muddy with time."
59:50;59:51;"The frogs were first."
59:51;59:53;"They had done like five commercials,"
59:53;59:58;"maybe seven or so in Chicago where the work was being done."
59:58;01:00:01;"Out in San Francisco, we had project work."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"We weren't the real agency."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"They were just throwing out projects here and there."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"And we came up with the spoof of the frogs, essentially,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"which was the lizards."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"It was going to be a one-off."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"They were going to run it during basketball playoffs."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"And it did so well."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"They said, let's make a bunch."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Let's shoot it for the Super Bowl."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"So this kind of one-off random spoof"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"became the main campaign."
01:00:22;01:00:26;"And it ended up being my career for the next 10 years"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"just because this thing hit."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"It hit big, real."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"So it was just good timing."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"It's fair to say that you are the lizard guy."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"Yes."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"The lizard king."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"You're the lizard king."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Me and my partner, Todd."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"Everything's partnerships in that business,"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"art director and writer."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"But yeah, me and my partner, Todd, created those."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"And we ran with it as long as we could."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"It treated me pretty well."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"And it's what led me into this job."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"It all just-- there's always one thing leading to the next."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"Because those were so high profile."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"People in LA started calling and saying,"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"hey, if you ever want to write TV shows, come on down."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Really?"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Yeah."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"So there is a lot of back and forth between entertainment"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"and advertising that somebody-- that's typical?"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"So much."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"I mean, there's-- even just at that agency,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"great people came out of there."
01:01:19;01:01:22;"Like Scott Burns is a huge screenwriter now."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"He writes half the Son of Perks movies."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"And he worked at your--"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"He worked at the same agency."
01:01:27;01:01:31;"Yeah, he did a gut milk spot right as I was arriving."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"And then he took off and did that."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"But no, advertising, there's a long--"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"because advertising draws a weird group of people."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"People fall into it."
01:01:40;01:01:44;"People have a lot of different skills and goals."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"And it's kind of-- you can keep a foot in it"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"while you're doing other things."
01:01:48;01:01:52;"So you actually-- if there was ever a list compiled,"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"you would recognize half the names."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"And they all started in advertising."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"It's-- people-- some people just jump out when they can."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"I did it for a good stretch."
01:02:00;01:02:03;"And-- but there's very talented people in the field."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"You know, sometimes it gets a weird reputation."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"Because in general, people don't care about commercials."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"But I think they do."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I think they do more and more."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Yeah, they definitely do."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"Yeah."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"Yeah, it's changed over the years."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"[MUSIC - ""I'M A MAN""]"
01:02:17;01:02:21;"Now you're looking at a man that's getting kind of mad."
01:02:21;01:02:25;"I had a lot to look, but it's all been bad."
01:02:25;01:02:29;"No matter how I struggle and strive,"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"I'll never get out of this world alive."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"My fishing pole's broke, the creek is full of sand."
01:02:37;01:02:41;"My woman run away with another man."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"No matter how I struggle and strive,"
01:02:45;01:02:50;"I'll never get out of this world alive."
01:02:50;01:02:58;"My distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch."
01:02:58;01:03:02;"And I was living high until the fatal day."
01:03:02;01:03:07;"Although you proved I wasn't born, I was only hatched."
01:03:07;01:03:11;"Everything's against me and it's got me down."
01:03:11;01:03:15;"If I jumped in the river, I would probably drown."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"No matter how I struggle and strive,"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"I'll never get out of this world alive."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"But so once you got the call from Hollywood, that was it?"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"You've never dipped your toe back in the advertising world?"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"Well, I kind of did both for a while."
01:03:31;01:03:35;"I've had a weird career path in that way where they called"
01:03:35;01:03:40;"and I started keeping my day job while writing pilots."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"So in the beginning, I would just write a pilot each year"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"while working in San Francisco."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"And I had bought a boat at the time."
01:03:49;01:03:53;"Advertising has some award shows with cash prizes."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"We won a lot of money."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"The award show has a cash prize?"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"Well, the awards industry in that business is particularly crazy"
01:04:02;01:04:08;"because the award shows make so much money off of people buying the awards"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"and people flying into the award shows."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"Wait, the Cleos? Is that one of them?"
01:04:14;01:04:17;"That's one of many. That's one of many."
01:04:17;01:04:21;"There's the one show, British D&AD, The Canned Lions."
01:04:21;01:04:25;"I mean, you know, like similar to any award show where like the Oscars,"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"all this money is spent on the campaigns and that kind of stuff."
01:04:29;01:04:34;"Yeah. Well, like for one, just any one given award show,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"let's say it's The Canned Lions,"
01:04:36;01:04:41;"a good agency has to submit each commercial, each print ad."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"It costs hundreds of dollars for each one."
01:04:43;01:04:49;"So an agency might spend $100,000 in entry fees just to enter."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Whoa."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"That's just one agency out of thousands."
01:04:52;01:04:56;"If they win, you know, and they fly in, they have to pay to go to the thing."
01:04:56;01:05:00;"If they win the award, you pay them a thousand bucks to actually get your award."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"You have to buy the award."
01:05:02;01:05:07;"So it's a money-making racket where each award show might be making,"
01:05:07;01:05:11;"I don't know, I'm guessing, but five or ten million dollars a year."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"It's even more."
01:05:13;01:05:19;"Whatever it is, it's enough so that there's one award show just for radio commercials"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"and we won the hundred grand."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"And I was like, whatever, 26, 27."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"I bought a boat."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"I was new to California."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"I was fresh from the East Coast and buying a boat, you know,"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"to have the first taste of money."
01:05:36;01:05:43;"You won $100,000 at an advertising award show for the Budweiser Lizards?"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Yeah, yeah. Exactly."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"So what did you name the boat?"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"You know, I never officially named it."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"I can be kind of lazy in that way."
01:05:52;01:05:59;"So the boat was named Cruiser 2 after some guy's Basset Hound,"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"who I bought the boat from."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"[laughter]"
01:06:03;01:06:06;"But the thing with boats, we could talk about boats all night,"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"because boats, you don't need any knowledge, you don't need any expertise,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"you don't need a license."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"There's no licensing system."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"That was not my understanding."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"You don't need a license to drive a boat."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"You need to be 16."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Don't you have to study maritime law?"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Nothing. They encourage it."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"They encourage you to take a class."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"But as long as you're 16,"
01:06:27;01:06:30;"it might be 18 now, but I think it was 16,"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"you can get yourself a boat and start cruising around,"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"because there are so few accidents and deaths,"
01:06:35;01:06:39;"it doesn't pay to have a licensing system in the state."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"So you're telling me at age 16 you could drive a boat,"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"but you can't run for president?"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Exactly."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"There's a lot of idiots like myself that have boats"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"and are just out there cruising around."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"But I had no knowledge of how to--"
01:06:54;01:06:58;"Wait, so when you were 26, did you have a car, an apartment?"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"I had those things, yeah."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"Did you own an apartment?"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"No, no."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"I didn't own anything except the boat."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"You really wanted a boat."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Well, you can imagine, like I said,"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"being at a young age where I never had money,"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"and I'm in California,"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"and a bunch of money falls in your lap all at once."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"It was a very fun thing."
01:07:22;01:07:25;"I was very determined to do it."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"It started out where I would just get 10 people in there"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"and cruise around the bay, around Alcatraz,"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"and zero knowledge of what I was doing."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"I did ground the boat once."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"We almost hit a rock outside of Alcatraz."
01:07:40;01:07:43;"It was a ridiculous time."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"Where did you dock it?"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"At first, it was down in Brisbane by the airport,"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"and then I got a spot where they made the stadium."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"I got the boat slip right as they were building that stadium."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"Years later, it was an incredible piece of real estate"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"because there's like a 15-year waiting list"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"to get into that marina."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"So if you wanted to go to a baseball game,"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"I had a parking spot literally 20 yards from the stadium."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"If you've ever been there,"
01:08:11;01:08:15;"the marina is literally where the home runs fly into the water."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"So, yeah, that was a crazy time."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"You're just learning how to ride a boat,"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"taking a cruise or two out."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"Wait, once you make it past the Golden Gate Bridge,"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"are you just in the Pacific Ocean?"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"I never went that far. I was terrified."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Yeah, to go out there would have been very--"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I wouldn't have risked everyone's lives."
01:08:35;01:08:39;"We just stayed in the bay before you get to the bridge,"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"and even that was not safe."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"Just some plus one was like,"
01:08:43;01:08:47;"""Yeah, I ended up on the Budweiser lizard guy's boat,"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"and he crashed into Alcatraz."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"I don't think he knew what he was doing."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"I don't know. My friend invited me."""
01:08:53;01:08:55;"[laughter]"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"It was bad, yeah."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"There were times when people had good reason"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"to be fearful for their lives."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Because if fog rolled in,"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"I wouldn't have known what to do."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"I wouldn't have known where to call."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"There were notoriously intense conditions."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"That Bay Area weather--"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"It's very rough. Yeah, it's rough water."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"We never had any serious accidents."
01:09:16;01:09:21;"That was getting into the Internet money times."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"To be in San Francisco,"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"it was just an especially heady time"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"of Internet money just starting to happen."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"That was going to be a few years later."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"It was just a lot of people with a lot of money,"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"advertising."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"It happened to be a hot city to be in."
01:09:38;01:09:41;"I was just at a moment in my life"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"where things were just starting to work."
01:09:44;01:09:48;"Looking back, it was a really fun, crazy time for me."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"I'm sure."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"Were you technically the captain?"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"Yeah, I took great pride in telling people"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I was the captain."
01:09:56;01:10:00;"My understanding, because it comes up often now,"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"was that during Life and Times of Tim,"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"you lived on the boat."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"As these myths can grow,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"I worked on the boat."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"I would go out-- That was my office."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"I would go out there with my dog, Byron,"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"each morning."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"That was just my work day."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"I'd wake up--"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Even though we were making the show in LA,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"we stayed up in San Francisco for most--"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"We'd fly down here and there."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"I'd go out there in the morning and write"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"all morning 'til lunch."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"It's just the best place to have an office."
01:10:29;01:10:31;"If you're a writer and you want solitude,"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"there's nothing better than just being at a marina,"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"like water is just naturally soothing."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Right."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Like anyone, I have a lot of ideas"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"in a bath or a shower."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Being on the water,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"with no one to talk to you."
01:10:44;01:10:47;"I wrote half of that show on that boat."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"Do you still have Cruiser 2?"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"No, I just got rid of it a year ago,"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"maybe two."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"It was just starting to deteriorate."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"I wasn't going there enough."
01:10:56;01:10:59;"I was going to just give it away"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"and junk it, essentially."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"But two cops took it in."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"I don't know what they're doing with it now,"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"but I guess cops have free slips."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"They can get a free slip in San Francisco."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Two 16-year-old cops."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"[laughs]"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"It was a happy ending"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"where these guys really wanted it"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"and I knew it wasn't going to just go to a junkyard."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"I let it go."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"It was an old fishing boat to start with."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Hold on. I'm sorry."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"That's a funny perk for being a police officer."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"[laughs]"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"You get a spot for your boat."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"[laughs]"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"Maybe it's a Coast Guard thing."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"I don't know."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"That was the story I was told."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"It wasn't a slip at the Good Marina."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"It was a slip at Fisherman's Wharf,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"which is a little more industrial,"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"all the fishing boats."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"It's not a prime spot."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"I guess every waterfront city"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"has its water police."
01:11:56;01:11:59;"New York, they have police boats and stuff, right?"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"San Francisco."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Maybe these guys work for that department or something."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"I don't know."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"We never got too deep into it."
01:12:07;01:12:09;"They were happy. I was happy."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"I was looking for a happy ending."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"You get attached to a boat"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"after all that time, a lot of memories."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"The idea of going to the junkyard,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I wasn't pleased with."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"But it's hard to give a boat away."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"I learned a lot about that."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"It's like that whole Cars for Kids thing."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"No, it is."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"It's a bit of a scam"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"if you ever research that stuff."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"What is the deal with Cars for Kids?"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Great ad, by the way. I don't know if that's one of yours."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"No, that's not."
01:12:38;01:12:42;"I shouldn't badmouth that particular one."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I know with boats..."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"What's the deal with the organization, though?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"You said there's something..."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"It's essentially a used car company"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"fronting as the charity."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"If you see an ad that says"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"""Give your boat to the SPCA,"""
01:12:56;01:12:58;"what really happens is"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"a used car company contacts you."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"They only accept the boat"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"if they think they can turn a profit on it."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"A lot of people get rejected and you can't give it away."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"If they do take it,"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"it's only because they know for a fact"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"they can resell it for $5,000"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"and the charity gets"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"10% of their profit."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"The SPCA will end up getting"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"$75"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"and they'll have a $10,000 boat."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"And you gave it away for free."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"Yeah."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Thinking you were giving it to charity."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"Yeah, so I'm guessing Cars for Kids"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"is in that camp."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"I shouldn't say that,"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"but it's one of these things."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"That makes total sense because that's one of those commercials."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"What is it? Is it 1-877-"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Cars for Kids?"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"1-877-"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Cars for Kids?"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Because those ads are so creepy,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"but it's always like kids playing"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"instruments and singing the song."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"And I don't think they say anything about"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"the company. They just repeat the phone number."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"And the only reason"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"you and I know that"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"jingles is because the media"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"buy is so huge"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"because someone's making a ton of money."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"Someone is making so much"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"money they can run"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"that jingle enough to make it"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"household name,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Cars for Kids. It's not because the"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"charity is getting free air time."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"Right. I can already picture"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"the article in The Atlantic"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"like, ""Meet the Cars for Kids"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"billionaire."""
01:14:26;01:14:28;"Just like some dude who just amassed"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"so much money via cars."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"Yeah, it's because nobody knows."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"In theory, some money goes to a charity."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Alright, so we got to start"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"boats for kids."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Boats for"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"brats."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Let's get it going."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Do some big ad buys and we can"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"really take over the market."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"If I had a boat"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"I'd go out on the ocean"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"And if I had a pony"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I'd ride"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"him on my boat"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"And we could all together"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"go out on the ocean"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"And set me up"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"on my pony on my boat"
01:15:06;01:15:10;"If I were Rod Rogers"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"I'd sure not be single"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"I couldn't bring myself"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"to marry an old"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"damsel"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"It would just be me"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"and Trevor"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"We'd go riding through the moors"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"And we'd buy a boat"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"and on the sea we'd sail"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"And if I"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"had a boat"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"I'd go out on the ocean"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"And if I had a"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"pony I'd ride"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"him on my boat"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"And we could all together"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"go out on the ocean"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"And set me up"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"on my pony on my boat"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"So then what's been going on"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"between the"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Life and Times of Tim, because that was on"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"2008-2012"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"and 10 year old Tom"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"What were you up to in that decade?"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Yeah, that's some lost"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"years for me, because"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"in general"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"and in this business"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"it's tricky, all I do is"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"my own work, it's all I"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"do is just try to sell my own shows"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"and that's not an easy path"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"to take, because it's just hard"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"to do and you can work on something for years"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"and then it's a yes or a no"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"and for me it was four no's in a row"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"so"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I spent like 8 years"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"just writing"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"and I've sold some"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"they were all good projects that people"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"enthusiastically bought"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"and paid me to write"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"but at the end of the day if they don't get on the air"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"it's just in the garbage"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"so it's like, it's as if I did nothing"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"if people ask me, it's like whatever happened"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"to that guy? But if you're selling shows"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"and writing them, you did do a lot of work"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"Oh yeah, that's the thing"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"It just didn't result in a show"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Yeah, so I was"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"always sitting there like"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"I'm not getting credit for how close I'm getting"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"because it's not easy to"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"get that close"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"but yeah, it was basically four big projects"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"and I made some mistakes"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"along the way"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"but the first one, that business"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"is all kind of celebrity stuff"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"I did a project"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"with Casey and Ben Affleck"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"that was my first thing right after Tim"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"because it was exciting"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"and I was like, oh Casey seems like a great guy"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"You pitched it to me, remember?"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Yeah, that's right, that's how we met, I met you doing that"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"and it could have been great"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"but in the end"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"I spent almost two years on it"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"and in the end it didn't go"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"you know"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"that group wasn't like a dream team of"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"comedy writing"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"as it turns out"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"and those guys obviously"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"are doing all kinds of other things"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"I'm the only one sitting there only doing that"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Right"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"A lot of people probably would have taken staff jobs"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"most people write on other shows"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"and I've just never went down that road"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Yeah, I'm sure you could have"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Yeah, but alright, I get it, that makes total sense"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"You like to work on your own stuff"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"I don't like the structure"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"just like I was saying, I used to sit on the boat doing the advertising"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"I don't think I'd survive"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"in a writer's room"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"on someone else's show"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"sitting there from 10 to God knows what hours"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"I just wouldn't"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"survive, so I almost had no choice"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"but to try to sell my own thing"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Right"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"It just takes time, you know, it takes forever"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"so"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"you learn stuff, you learn a lot"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"I'm a better person, I'm a better writer"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"I can make this show in a more confident way"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"When I made Tim, I was so"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"fresh in the business"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"and just going with my instincts"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"having no, just like with the boat"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"I had no idea what I was doing"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"but just ran a whole"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"department, a whole staff"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"making a TV show for HBO"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Now at least I've been there"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"I'm still doing it in a similar way, but at least I know"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"second time you do it, you're a different person"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"than the first time"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Right"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"You take everything as a learning experience"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"that's all you can do, if you spend two years on a project"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"and get close and they say"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"""Nah, if you're just depressed"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"what are you gonna do?"""
01:19:10;01:19:12;"It's no way to move forward"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Right, you gotta move on to the next thing"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"Yeah, you learn"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"and now when I'm sitting here in this"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"moment, I feel like it all"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"happened for a reason"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"I almost didn't retrospect"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"I'm happy none of those shows went, because this is the one"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"I'm meant to do"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"I feel like fate leads you to something"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Right, and I'm sure in all those years you also"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"were living your life and having fun"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"taking the boat out"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Yeah Are you gonna get a new boat?"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"No, I don't"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"think... a boat is so much"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"a boat sounds"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"like fun, within a year"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"I realized, ""Oh, I don't like owning boats"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"I like sitting in the back of boats"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"with a beer"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"Owning a boat is a whole other thing"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"it's not fun at all"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"When you're going out, and there's eight people"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"and your response"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"it's like, all you're doing is looking around"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"make sure no one's falling off, make sure you're not gonna hit anything"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Right, isn't it also"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"constant maintenance?"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"It should be constant maintenance, but since"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"I didn't do the maintenance"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"the boat deteriorated, which made"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"the boat unsafe, and it was a"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"downward spiral of"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"the boat getting"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"in worse condition, my knowledge"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"not increasing"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"and it just turned into my office"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"so that's what I... I just ended up"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"saying, ""Hey, if it floats, I'm happy"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"as long as it doesn't sink, we're good"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"but yeah, no more boats"""
01:20:34;01:20:36;"The way you talk about it, it's so romantic"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"to spend that much time on the"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"sea, like... but so you can"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"do you still get out onto the open"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"water, you just charter a boat"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"or you just take a ride on"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"somebody else's boat?"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"No, I've got very few boats in my life"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"anymore, it was... sometimes things"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"are just a moment in time"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"You don't live in the Bay Area anymore?"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"No, we still have a place"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"there, but it's mostly LA"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"so yeah, it was"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"the boat... there was not"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"enough time spent there"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"but yeah, sometimes it's just"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"you gotta... I like to do"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"like I said, I like to do what my instincts"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"are telling me in any given moment"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"and back then, that was 100%"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"what I was meant to do"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"now, I don't even think about it"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Hey Steve, I'm"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"Seinfeld2000, I run the Twitter account"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"@Seinfeld2000"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"I'm just a big fan of the show"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"I love Tim and"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"the new one, I just wanted to tell you"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"that I googled it and"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"Karts4Kids also takes boats"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Oh really?"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Yeah, they take boats and they also take"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"real estate"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"Really? Interesting. You take real estate?"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"Yeah, apparently, according to"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"Wikipedia, it's real estate cars"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"bread and butter is cars, but"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"there's real estate boats as well"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"What the hell?"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Interesting"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"So you can just start any kind of business"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"they wouldn't take your boat"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"No, no one. I've made every"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"call you could make"
01:22:08;01:22:18;"In the middle of God's holder Mellowed out chatting of thoughts I used to hate"
01:22:18;01:22:28;"The feeling that we're lost will always fade I present no explanations"
01:22:28;01:22:36;"Can't expect our tired patients To say she ain't for long"
01:22:36;01:22:40;"Errant lies are true We can sip when we want"
01:22:40;01:22:44;"Disciples of the flow We can flout anywhere"
01:22:44;01:22:48;"Whenever there's a drought I listed the puddles"
01:22:48;01:22:54;"Proving to better coax The divan out from within"
01:22:54;01:23:00;"Yes, so Steve, obviously, or maybe you get that on TC, we tend just to talk about random stuff, but"
01:23:00;01:23:06;"just tell us a little bit about the new show. I mean, Nick kind of teed it up before you got on, so the listeners"
01:23:06;01:23:12;"already have a sense of the show, but just tell us a little bit from your perspective about"
01:23:12;01:23:18;"10-year-old Tom and everybody's got to go check it out, just like what they should expect or"
01:23:18;01:23:24;"what you want people to know about it. It's funny, when it came out, you know, I had my other show I did"
01:23:24;01:23:30;"Life and Times of Tim, and I love that, it's got its own cult following, and when we"
01:23:30;01:23:36;"made this, I was just making it, I was just doing whatever I thought was right in this"
01:23:36;01:23:44;"moment for me right now, and it's funny, when it came out, I was so surprised"
01:23:44;01:23:50;"at just how much people connected with the old one, it's like, it's the dominant story in a lot of the"
01:23:50;01:23:58;"reviews and in a lot of social media stuff, it's just like the presence of the old shows"
01:23:58;01:24:06;"in a good way, just really there, where it's, you know, people just are really connecting the dots, and creatively"
01:24:06;01:24:12;"it's not too different, if you ever saw the old one, it was a little more crude, and now, like I said, I've"
01:24:12;01:24:18;"had a little experience, so the new one is a little more polished, it's just whatever my instincts are telling me"
01:24:18;01:24:24;"today, but it's been a cool thing, because it becomes more of a body of work"
01:24:24;01:24:30;"and more of, you know, an expansion on something I started at a certain time, so I really"
01:24:30;01:24:36;"kind of, and I love it, because the network, they put my old show, it hadn't been, it's an old story in itself, but"
01:24:36;01:24:44;"Tim wasn't on HBO for many years, and they just re-launched it when they launched my new one,"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"so all of a sudden I've got two shows out there, so it's been very exciting. - Right, so there's probably a lot of people"
01:24:48;01:24:52;"seeing Life and Times of Tim for the first time, because finally it's streaming. - Yeah, so it's this weird"
01:24:52;01:24:58;"thing where these things don't have a shelf life on them anymore, so just the fact that it's"
01:24:58;01:25:04;"out there, for a lot of people it might as well be a brand new show, and with the new one,"
01:25:04;01:25:08;"a lot of people are discovering that first, and then saying ""oh, you have an old show, I didn't even know that"","
01:25:08;01:25:14;"so it all just gets tossed in the mix together, and it's been a real pleasant surprise,"
01:25:14;01:25:22;"but yeah, if you ever compare the two, it's a similar character, similar look, and it's just, as a little kid,"
01:25:22;01:25:28;"but it's actually more of a profound difference than I think I even realized, that I write a lot of underdog characters,"
01:25:28;01:25:36;"I write a lot of outsider-type characters, and doing it as a kid, with the whole theme of this show,"
01:25:36;01:25:42;"the whole thing just has more resonance, I think, and more of a point,"
01:25:42;01:25:50;"a little more poignancy at times, it's like, my old show, the premise was more or less just"
01:25:50;01:25:58;"""the world is sh*tting on this guy, over and over, a good guy just can't get a break, somehow the world will conspire against you"","
01:25:58;01:26:06;"and then this is more about a, you know, when I pitched it, it was really, you know,"
01:26:06;01:26:12;"how does a kid grow up these days without being corrupted by all the grown-ups around them?"
01:26:12;01:26:18;"And with that as a question to jump off from, it just infuses the whole show with a little more meaning,"
01:26:18;01:26:23;"searching for the subject matter isn't just what's funny, it's like, what's relevant, what's a point,"
01:26:23;01:26:28;"because, you know, this whole thing came out of looking at the headlines, and it's like,"
01:26:28;01:26:34;"when I look at the world, it's such a different thing than it was when I was a kid."
01:26:34;01:26:39;"Like, for a kid to look at, process the world, it's just so profoundly different to me,"
01:26:39;01:26:44;"it's an interesting topic, whether you're making a comedy show or not,"
01:26:44;01:26:48;"what does a kid make of it when they look at the TV or whatever, the internet,"
01:26:48;01:26:57;"and every politician is overtly corrupt, every business leader, half the athletes, religious figures,"
01:26:57;01:27:05;"it's like, you can't turn to a pillar of society without seeing a very obvious example of someone misbehaving,"
01:27:05;01:27:10;"and when I was a kid, I didn't see that, you know, most people didn't,"
01:27:10;01:27:17;"so to me, it's really infused the whole writing of the show with, I think, something needed,"
01:27:17;01:27:21;"so it's just as funny and stupid, you know, if you watch the show,"
01:27:21;01:27:27;"it won't sound quite as intellectual as what I'm saying now, but it's there, it's in the writing,"
01:27:27;01:27:31;"it's what makes me choose the subject matter, so hopefully that adds up,"
01:27:31;01:27:37;"and when people watch it, it's not like a flimsy, you know, animated cartoon,"
01:27:37;01:27:43;"I treat this stuff like I would a live-action show, so I'm just trying to sort through it in my own way,"
01:27:43;01:27:48;"and make sense of the world in my own way, and I guess a lot of it's looking back on my own childhood,"
01:27:48;01:27:53;"and things come out in the writing, so it's a long-winded answer, I guess,"
01:27:53;01:27:57;"but it's interesting, when you stumble on something, and maybe it took me a while to get there,"
01:27:57;01:28:03;"but it really matters to me, I really care about the character and the stories,"
01:28:03;01:28:06;"and hopefully people pick up on that."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"- Well, that's great. - Yeah."
01:28:08;01:28:13;"And it's awesome that both shows are kind of like together, and people can see the old work,"
01:28:13;01:28:17;"and the new work, watch them, whichever way they're finding in."
01:28:17;01:28:22;"Especially, it's been overwhelming, because to go from eight years of trying,"
01:28:22;01:28:28;"and aspiring, and failing, to just an avalanche of positivity, it's like,"
01:28:28;01:28:33;"""Whoa, what just happened?"" It's like, ""People seem to be liking the new show,"
01:28:33;01:28:38;"""everyone's finding the old show,"" and it's just like, overnight, snap of the finger,"
01:28:38;01:28:43;"and everything's working again, so it's been a great couple of weeks here."
01:28:43;01:28:49;"That's awesome. Everybody's got to check it out, and thanks so much for coming on, Steve."
01:28:49;01:28:53;"The last thing I'll say, I don't know if this will take you anywhere,"
01:28:53;01:29:01;"but I have your bio in front of me as we speak, and I notice you're exactly one month older than Jay-Z."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Do you..."
01:29:03;01:29:09;"So you're almost exactly the same age."
01:29:09;01:29:15;"Is that what the note... Is that actually what Matt wrote on the note?"
01:29:15;01:29:19;"No, no, it doesn't say that in the notes. No, it doesn't say that in the notes."
01:29:19;01:29:25;"It says, ""Steve's birthday,"" and I know that Jay-Z was also born in late 1969."
01:29:25;01:29:30;"You and Jay got in at the buzzer to be children of the '60s, but, you know."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"That's right. That's right."
01:29:31;01:29:36;"Clearly, most of your childhood would have been in the '70s and '80s, but yeah, he was born in..."
01:29:36;01:29:40;"Famously, he was born in early December 1969."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"That's right."
01:29:41;01:29:46;"Are you a fan? Do you think of him as being like, ""Oh, yeah, that's my generation""?"
01:29:46;01:29:54;"Absolutely, yeah. I'm definitely a fan. Yeah, I didn't even think about how old he is, but..."
01:29:54;01:29:59;"Now that you say it, yeah, that feels... That feels right. I'll take that."
01:29:59;01:30:05;"Should we get Steve to request his favorite Jay-Z song since we play music occasionally on the show?"
01:30:05;01:30:10;"Is there any Jay-Z song that comes to mind? I feel like this is almost like..."
01:30:10;01:30:17;"And not just your favorite, but one that really embodies your generation of men born in late 1969."
01:30:17;01:30:26;"Maybe my first song. Maybe that's kind of thematically tied into what we've been talking about."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Oh, yeah. That's a good one."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Well, thanks so much, 10-year-old Tom."
01:30:31;01:30:35;"And don't forget about The Life and Times of Tim, now streaming on HBO Max."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"Thanks so much, Steve. I hope you'll call in again. It's been great talking to you."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"The Lizard King."
01:30:40;01:30:46;"The Lizard King himself. And we didn't even get to talk about New Jersey, which..."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Okay, we'll save that."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"We'll save that for next time."
01:30:50;01:30:55;"But it's been great talking to you. I really appreciate you having me."
01:30:55;01:30:58;"This has been a real thrill. I'm a big fan, and this has been great."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"Oh, that's awesome. We're thrilled to have you. All right, have a good one."
01:31:01;01:31:04;"All right. Thanks. See you guys."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"Thanks, Steve."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"All right. Peace."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Well, thank you to Steve Dildaren."
01:33:11;01:33:17;"We lost Jake. Nick just went to the bathroom. Just me and you, Seinfeld. That's fun."
01:33:17;01:33:21;"It's intimate. What did I miss? I had to jump off from the Steve."
01:33:21;01:33:24;"Can you give me a recap of the first 40 minutes of that?"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"We did a solid 38 minutes on his boat."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Okay."
01:33:28;01:33:32;"Well, it's no longer his boat, but it's called Cruiser Two,"
01:33:32;01:33:38;"which he bought after he won a cash prize at an advertising awards show."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Oh."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"Boat culture is interesting, especially like urban boat culture,"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"because he kept it in the Bay Area."
01:33:45;01:33:49;"You know, obviously there's like yacht life, billionaires,"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"and people who sail boats all around the world."
01:33:51;01:33:56;"But then there's also just like people have like little boat that you take out and drink beers on."
01:33:56;01:34:01;"It's kind of like he said he never even took it out outside of the East Bay, basically."
01:34:01;01:34:05;"Yeah. I was in Marina Del Rey a couple months ago,"
01:34:05;01:34:10;"and there's this giant dock area with a ton of boats."
01:34:10;01:34:14;"They just seem to be ported there. They don't really seem to go anywhere."
01:34:14;01:34:18;"And I always wonder what they're up to. Where are they actually going with those boats?"
01:34:18;01:34:24;"Well, I guess you could sail to Catalina. That's like a short trip down there."
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Yeah. And I think a lot of people just, I guess some people are into just,"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"you keep the boat docked and you just sit on it."
01:34:30;01:34:35;"And just sort of gently float with the movement of the water."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"And you drink beers."
01:34:36;01:34:41;"I think it's kind of like, it's like places that don't have floating dock culture."
01:34:41;01:34:45;"If you don't live by a lake, you could just go sit on a boat in the ocean."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"Yeah. Or I guess you go fishing. Some people are into fishing."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"Have you ever been on a cruise?"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"No, I've never been on a cruise."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"No."
01:34:53;01:34:57;"Neither. Yeah. Honestly, I don't really see the appeal."
01:34:57;01:35:02;"It makes me nervous. The idea of being isolated on the water for such a long."
01:35:02;01:35:05;"Did you guys see that documentary on HBO?"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"For some reason, no one talked about it, but it was unbelievable."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"Oh, there's a cruise documentary?"
01:35:10;01:35:11;"The COVID cruise."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Oh, really?"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"I heard about that a long time ago."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Didn't OPN do the music?"
01:35:17;01:35:20;"Did he? I didn't even notice that. Maybe he did."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"I have a vague memory of talking to him a long time ago and just being like,"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"what are you working on?"
01:35:25;01:35:29;"And I'm pretty sure he said, I'm doing some movie about the Japanese,"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"the princess COVID cruise."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"The last cruise, yeah."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"The princess."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"Did it have cool, vibey music?"
01:35:37;01:35:41;"I think so. Honestly, I think it did. It had to."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"But you guys need to see this."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Yeah, I want to see that."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Yeah, he did. Daniel did it."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Oh yeah, I heard about that. Okay."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"That's wild."
01:35:50;01:35:57;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:35:57;01:36:02;"So without Jake, we're just going to burn through the top five songs on iTunes."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"We're not going to do a comparative one."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"I should ask Steve to stay."
01:36:06;01:36:10;"But, you know, we might be going into some weird uncharted territory."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"No ironic pun intended,"
01:36:12;01:36:15;"but this might be uncharted territory as we go through the charts."
01:36:15;01:36:19;"Just because we've been staying away from like the current top five."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"It's just felt so kind of like random."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"But I'm sure there's good stuff."
01:36:23;01:36:26;"The number five song right now on the iTunes chart."
01:36:26;01:36:31;"The artist is called Why Don't We and the song is called Love Back."
01:36:31;01:36:35;"Why Don't We is a boy band from Los Angeles."
01:36:35;01:36:39;"I still got your halo hanging on the corner of my bed."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"But when I look closer that kiss is cracked."
01:36:42;01:36:45;"Is that a Sugar Ray reference?"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"What was the Sugar Ray reference?"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"A halo?"
01:36:50;01:36:53;"Oh yeah, like every morning there's a halo."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"Yeah."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"It tastes like put it on my tab."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Gave you my money and my time."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"You can keep all that, all that."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Baby I just want my love back."
01:37:05;01:37:11;"I'd love to love someone new, but I gave it all to you."
01:37:11;01:37:14;"Honey I just want my love back."
01:37:14;01:37:17;"If you're not gonna be the one."
01:37:17;01:37:20;"What do you think Jake would say about this?"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"I love it."
01:37:21;01:37:26;"You know, I feel like early Jake would just always be like, sucks."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"But then he's thrown some curve balls lately."
01:37:28;01:37:32;"I could also just picture him and be like, honestly, I'm in."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"And be like, what?"
01:37:35;01:37:36;"You never know."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"I don't know if fatherhood's mellowed Jake, but he might be like,"
01:37:39;01:37:43;"catchy song, great beat, love these guys."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"I think this is too down the middle for Jake."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Yeah, I think you're right."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"I showed you what heaven could taste like."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"Put it on my tab."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Gave you my money and my time."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"You can keep all that."
01:37:56;01:37:59;"Baby I just want my love back."
01:37:59;01:38:05;"I'd love to love someone new, but I gave it all to you."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"Honey I just want my love back."
01:38:08;01:38:11;"If you're not gonna be the one."
01:38:11;01:38:15;"At least give me back my love."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"Do you want to know something?"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"I got an idea."
01:38:17;01:38:21;"I think this top five is going to be us just talking about what we think Jake will think."
01:38:21;01:38:24;"And then next week we'll play it."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"All right."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Yeah."
01:38:27;01:38:31;"But okay, if we're actually, I would guess that Jake will just be like, eh."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"You're gonna hate it."
01:38:33;01:38:37;"I just remember when Jake, when he wrote for Madonna a couple years ago,"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"he was like, yeah, Madonna's dope."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Do you remember that?"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And I was surprised by that."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"That was like a first."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Jake was very pro-Madonna."
01:38:45;01:38:49;"Yeah, for some reason that surprised me."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"Yeah, I think you'd think it's down the middle and there's nothing in the lyrics"
01:38:52;01:38:56;"that sort of, you know, like the Olivia Rodrigo, obviously not down the middle,"
01:38:56;01:39:00;"but even the lyrics, the storytelling, the drive, like he responded to all of it."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"I don't really know what this guy's talking about."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"I think he would just be, eh."
01:39:04;01:39:08;"I think Jake would probably be kind of amused by the name."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Why don't we?"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Yes."
01:39:12;01:39:17;"Is it spelled, by the way, is it spelled like normal or is it like letter Y?"
01:39:17;01:39:21;"No, no, it's the words, but there's no question mark."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"I would have thought it was pretty cool if there was a question mark."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"It's just, why don't we?"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Yeah, sometimes those acts, they'll drop the punctuation."
01:39:27;01:39:31;"Like, do you remember when Pink used to be P, exclamation mark, N, A?"
01:39:31;01:39:32;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"She doesn't do that anymore?"
01:39:34;01:39:37;"I feel like she's just, she switched to an I."
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Sell out."
01:39:38;01:39:44;"The number four song is Elton John and Dua Lipa with Cold Heart,"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"the Panau remix."
01:39:47;01:39:53;"Okay, so this song is on Elton dropped a collaboration album called The Lockdown Sessions."
01:39:53;01:39:56;"Do we know how Jake feels about Elton John in general?"
01:39:56;01:39:57;"Fan, I would imagine."
01:39:57;01:40:01;"Yeah, I'm sure Jake would definitely love some Elton John."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Yeah, early Elton John."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"Didn't he talk about Rocketman when Rocketman came out?"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"Didn't he like walk in on the band or something?"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"Watch the film?"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"Was he a fan?"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Yeah."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"Are we making that up?"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"I'm confusing it with yesterday."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"I think he'd like this."
01:40:24;01:40:29;"Although I feel like I could also see Jake not liking auto-tuned Elton."
01:40:29;01:40:33;"Can you just see Jake just being like, auto-tuned Elton, come on."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Weak."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"And we'd be like, oh, come on, Jake."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"He's just trying something new."
01:40:50;01:40:51;"What is this called?"
01:40:51;01:40:57;"This is like an interpolation when they'll bring in just a part of another song like that and re-sing it."
01:40:57;01:41:03;"I guess the remixer, Panau, mashed it up with some of his other songs,"
01:41:03;01:41:07;"such as Rocketman, Sacrifice, Kiss the Bride, and Where's the Shura."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Oh, it's a whole mashup."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"I mean, I love Elton."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"I'm glad to see him."
01:41:23;01:41:30;"I honestly think his voice, his way of singing, which is still very Elton, over this kind of thing is weird."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"I like it."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"It's notable."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"He's on the Lil Nas X album, isn't he?"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Yeah."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"I mean, he's always doing cool stuff."
01:41:39;01:41:44;"He was on the Kanye album a long time ago."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"Oh, him and Eminem at the VMAs."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"I don't see Jake liking this."
01:42:06;01:42:10;"I'm sure Jake would be like, ""Give me a Tiny Dancer."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Give me a Benny and the Jets."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Not feeling this."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"No soul."""
01:42:16;01:42:18;"So the first one is forgettable."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"This one is negative."
01:42:20;01:42:27;"Well, I just think Jake would bring negative energy to it because he loves the tasteful palette of the '70s."
01:42:27;01:42:31;"Elton is an iconic tasteful '70s artist."
01:42:31;01:42:36;"So I just feel like Jake wouldn't know how to handle -- Jake wouldn't like the music."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"You know what I mean?"
01:42:38;01:42:42;"I think Jake would be pro-Elton but, like, wouldn't get the remix element."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"We'll see."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"We'll see."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"I like it."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"I love seeing Elton back on the charts."
01:43:05;01:43:06;"Ooh."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"I've actually been wanting to hear this song."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"I heard about this."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"But I have not heard this."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"This is major."
01:43:14;01:43:19;"Oh, man, I'm almost -- well, yeah, we'll go back through this next time with Jake because this is major."
01:43:19;01:43:25;"Coldplay and BTS came together for a song called ""My Universe."""
01:43:25;01:43:35;"It debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving BTS their sixth chart topper, and Coldplay's second after ""Viva La Vida"" in 2008."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"""My Universe"" was first revealed as part of the track listing for ""Music of the Spheres."""
01:43:39;01:43:41;"That's Coldplay's next album."
01:43:41;01:43:44;"I mean, just wow."
01:43:44;01:43:51;"I obviously know this isn't built to fill, but I do think that would have been -- that would be pretty epic."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"Jake might like this one."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"It's kind of like fun '80s."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"Do we ever read about his take on -- like, does he like Coldplay?"
01:44:31;01:44:34;"'Cause he's kind of neutral to Coldplay, right?"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"That's a good question."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"I'm sure he likes some songs."
01:45:17;01:45:24;"I feel like this song will probably make Jake get into some, like -- I bet Jake will ask a lot of questions about, like, wait, what is Coldplay?"
01:45:24;01:45:30;"Like, 'cause Jake likes bands, so he'll probably be like some, like, did the drummer play on this?"
01:45:30;01:45:33;"I think he'll want to, like, look under the hood at this song."
01:45:33;01:45:38;"I think he'll be positive, but kind of want to get into, like, what does it really mean?"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"Have we heard BTS yet?"
01:45:43;01:45:47;"No, Jake's been very positive about BTS in the past."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"I mean, this is the most interesting part of the song."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I think Jake will be down."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"It's got a good vibe."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"All right."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"The number two song."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"I don't know if we've heard this yet."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"Is this a new one from Ed Sheeran?"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"It's called ""Shivers""?"
01:47:07;01:47:11;"This took Ed three days to write, which is long for him."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"Lipstick on my guitar?"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Let me look this up."
01:47:33;01:47:35;"I don't understand how that happens."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"Yeah, lipstick on my guitar."
01:47:38;01:47:42;"What is that situation?"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"I still don't understand this lipstick on my guitar thing."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"All right, let's go back to the beginning."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"Yeah, you're right."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"That does kind of stand out."
01:49:25;01:49:30;"The beginning is pretty, I don't want to say straightforward."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"He's using poetic language."
01:49:32;01:49:38;"The rest of that verse is he's talking about, you know, falling madly for somebody."
01:49:38;01:49:43;"I mean, maybe he's just saying their first kiss was just like crazy."
01:49:43;01:49:45;"He's never felt this way before."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"There's such a deep attraction."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"And then just the night's getting wild."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"She's kissing his guitar."

01:49:58;01:50:03;"They're making out and then she just said, ""Wait, where's your guitar?"""

01:50:08;01:50:10;"It's leaned up in the corner in that case."

01:50:18;01:50:20;"Ed Sheeran's a father now, right?"

01:50:24;01:50:27;"Like, maybe there's just been like, you know, a little one running around."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"Just like, you know, rubbing lipstick on stuff."
01:50:30;01:50:35;"And this is more of like a domestic scene."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Oh, okay."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"So you're saying Ed Sheeran's cheating on his wife."

01:50:47;01:50:51;"He's like quickly slamming down all the pictures of his kids."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"And he's like, ""Wait, didn't I read that you're married with kids?"""
01:50:55;01:50:57;"And he's just like, ""No."""
01:50:57;01:50:59;"And then she's like, ""Okay."""
01:50:59;01:51:02;"And she's like, ""You want to play me something on the guitar?"""
01:51:02;01:51:03;"He pulls the guitar out."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"As Seinfeld said, the kids had been in there."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Took mommy's lipstick."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"And they made a whole mess."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"And she's like, ""Ugh, what's going on in here?"""
01:51:10;01:51:13;"And he's like, ""Uh, I did that."""
01:51:13;01:51:16;"And now he's got lipstick all over his hands."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"Wipes it on his shirt."
01:51:19;01:51:20;"It's a mess."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"I just put some lipstick on my guitar."
01:51:22;01:51:27;"There's also like a lot of Duplos in there."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"What's that about?"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"And he's like, ""You know what?"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Quit touching my stuff."""
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Are you feeling what I'm feeling?"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Enough."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Stop talking about that."
01:51:37;01:51:40;"Okay, this is kind of provocative material from Ed."
01:51:40;01:51:43;"But I like the song, though."
01:51:43;01:51:44;"I like the pizzicato string."
