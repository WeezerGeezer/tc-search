00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back again. On this week's episode we have two very special guests."
00:06;00:13;"The legend Tom O'Neill, author of Chaos, Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the"
00:13;00:19;"60s. Plus, we finally make direct contact with the Hershey/Reese's company. We'll be talking"
00:19;00:25;"to Ryan Reese, their director of social strategy. All this, plus marijuana t-shirts and McDonald's."
00:25;00:30;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:20;01:23;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. How's everybody doing?"
01:23;01:24;"Doing pretty well."
01:24;01:31;"Lots been going on. Big news, couple weeks for the TC community. This is the type of stuff I"
01:31;01:36;"normally forget, but this one's so big that I was getting tagged and stuff for like three days."
01:36;01:43;"Did you guys see this picture of LeBron wearing head-to-toe Grateful Dead gear before a game?"
01:43;01:49;"Yes, I was tagged a few times. You know what's funny on my Instagram? You know Instagram,"
01:49;01:53;"there's the one setting, it's all the stuff you've posted, and then there's all the other"
01:53;01:56;"setting of stuff that you've been tagged in? Yes."
01:56;02:02;"It used to be everything on my Instagram was pictures of my paintings, you know?"
02:02;02:03;"Yeah."
02:03;02:09;"And now it's all very obscure Time Crisis riffs, memes, whatever you want to call it."
02:09;02:14;"So anyway, I think there's at least one image or video clip of LeBron wearing the"
02:14;02:21;"Grateful Dead bears shorts and sweatshirt with my name on it."
02:21;02:23;"And don't forget about the Crocs."
02:23;02:25;"Okay, was it also a dead Croc?"
02:25;02:29;"He was wearing the dead Crocs. I realize actually as I'm saying this that we never followed up"
02:29;02:36;"about the fact that you and I both have received, not Grateful Dead, but Jerry Garcia shoes"
02:36;02:36;"recently."
02:36;02:38;"I never got mine. I don't know what happened."
02:38;02:39;"Oh really?"
02:39;02:41;"What are they called? The Keens?"
02:41;02:43;"Keens. We got to rectify that."
02:43;02:50;"I ended up getting my pair of the Jerry Garcia Keens, which I know they asked for your info as"
02:50;02:56;"well, Jake, so you should be getting them. I got those the same day that I unexpectedly got a pair"
02:56;03:00;"of the Grateful Dead dunks, which I had very mixed feelings about."
03:00;03:05;"I think I said that I was going to talk about it on TC, but we forgot about it for the last one."
03:05;03:11;"But I've got a $2,000 pair of Grateful Dead dunks sitting in my home."
03:11;03:15;"Is that what they're still going for Seinfeld? A resident sneakerhead?"
03:15;03:18;"Oh my God. Let me check. What color, by the way?"
03:18;03:19;"I'm gonna go check right now, actually."
03:19;03:30;"While he does that, they are going from $844 to $2,600, depending on the color."
03:30;03:35;"I could do an unboxing video for you guys. It'll become an audio unboxing"
03:35;03:42;"little bit for the listeners at home. I'm holding the box. I'm showing the fellas."
03:42;03:47;"These are the Nike SBs. I'm opening. Here, listen to the rustling of the paper a little bit."
03:47;03:53;"That's the paper that is inside the box. Okay, I got the green ones."
03:53;03:58;"So the green ones are sort of the second most valuable. They're right in the middle."
03:58;04:05;"And those range anywhere from, yeah, from about $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size."
04:05;04:06;"I'm a 10."
04:06;04:10;"10? Then you are sitting on a pair of $1,300 shoes."
04:10;04:14;"Damn. What's for $3,000? What's a rare size?"
04:14;04:16;"Your size 14, the biggest size."
04:16;04:18;"Yeah. Yeah. 10's right down the middle."
04:18;04:25;"Well, when I hold it in my hands, it's more attractive than when I just looked at a picture."
04:25;04:29;"Now that you have them, could you ever see yourself wearing them?"
04:29;04:35;"Well, I've got a bit of an issue is that I've always been a kind of like one pair of shoes guy."
04:35;04:39;"And it's funny because I'm not like, you know, some like just super down to earth person who"
04:39;04:44;"would be like, man, I don't care what I wear. Obviously, that's not me. I put thought into"
04:44;04:51;"trying to come up with provocative outfits and trying to stay on trend."
04:52;04:59;"But there's something about shoes for me that's always kind of where the practicality overrode"
04:59;05:03;"my sense of fashion and keeping things fresh. I like kind of looking in my closet and,"
05:03;05:08;"you know, looking at my different shirts. And, you know, if I have some time in the morning being"
05:08;05:14;"like, oh, that'd be cool. I felt good the other day that I put on a pair of khakis and I had this"
05:14;05:20;"like a brown Ralph Lauren pocket t-shirt that I bought at Macy's like five years ago and I put"
05:20;05:25;"it together. And some people are like, that's a nice color combination. You know, I like to put"
05:25;05:30;"together a little outfit here and there. But with shoes, it's always the last thing on my mind. I"
05:30;05:35;"like to just put on whatever is right outside the door. And I do have different shoes. Of course,"
05:35;05:40;"I have exercise shoes. So anyway, I appreciate shoes and yet I've never felt like I needed a lot"
05:40;05:45;"of them, even though, of course, a shoe can tie a whole outfit together. So I don't know if I'm"
05:45;05:49;"just lazy or too practical or something. But so basically, it's a long way of answering your"
05:49;05:55;"question when you say, could I picture myself wearing them? I'm just like, I have shoes that"
05:55;06:03;"I actually bought that I never wear because I basically wear the same pair of shoes every"
06:03;06:07;"single day. And occasionally I'll somehow like they'll get out of rotation and I'll just start"
06:07;06:13;"wearing another pair every single day. I even remember like being a kid once. There was like"
06:13;06:18;"a schoolyard bully who was making fun of another kid. The schoolyard bully was saying to the kid,"
06:18;06:25;"you loser, you wore those same shoes yesterday. Somehow I distinctly remember that I wasn't"
06:25;06:31;"being compassionate towards the victim. I just have this distinct memory of a kid making fun"
06:31;06:36;"of another kid. Maybe even for some reason, I disliked the kid getting made fun of or I thought"
06:36;06:40;"that maybe they were the real bully. I don't know. All I knew is that I listened to a kid say, man,"
06:40;06:44;"you wore those shoes yesterday. And I just remember like I wasn't even trying to stick"
06:44;06:47;"up for anybody. I was just like, what the are you talking about? Who would choose different"
06:47;06:52;"shoes every day? Just from a young age, I believe that shoes were in a fundamentally different"
06:52;06:57;"category than shirts or pants. I could understand a schoolyard bully coming up to a kid and saying,"
06:57;07:02;"you dirty schmuck, you wore that shirt yesterday. You know, at least that would track for me as a"
07:02;07:06;"cruel thing for a kid to make fun of. I just remember at this point, it wasn't even for me."
07:06;07:11;"I wasn't even trying to be like, hey, leave him alone. Not everybody has lots of pairs of shoes."
07:11;07:15;"I remember distinctly, I couldn't, my brain couldn't even go there yet because I was just"
07:15;07:20;"like, what the are you talking about? I always understood that you had one pair of shoes until"
07:20;07:25;"you until there was a hole in them. Then you'd get a new pair of shoes. You know what I'm saying?"
07:25;07:30;"Yeah. I don't like it when I'm wearing something that catches people's eyes. I don't like that."
07:30;07:34;"Like just going in like the grocery store. And if I'm wearing those green chunky donkeys,"
07:34;07:40;"I'm going to feel people like the shoes attracting people's eyes and attention."
07:41;07:47;"And then they're going to look at me and I just don't want to be analyzed by randos"
07:47;07:53;"because I'm wearing like funky green shoes. And those are definitely not an everyday shoe."
07:53;07:58;"No. You'd be getting analyzed every which way if you were these to the grocery store,"
07:58;08:01;"because you'd be getting people just being like, look at that eye popping color."
08:01;08:04;"You know, you might just get like an old lady or something saying,"
08:04;08:08;"look at you with your green shoes. Those are marvelous."
08:08;08:12;"Green's my favorite color. And you just be head down. It's like, not today, man."
08:12;08:19;"I'm busy. And then you probably have some other like deadheads being like, hey, come here. I once"
08:19;08:24;"bagged some groceries for Jerry Garcia on the day he died. And you're just like, man, you told me"
08:24;08:29;"that last week. Enough, man. I'm just trying to grab a bag of chips and get back to the studio."
08:29;08:33;"And then you'd have another category of people coming up to you uncomfortably being like,"
08:34;08:39;"wow, those shoes are worth one to three thousand dollars. Like that's weird, too."
08:39;08:44;"Somebody coming up to you just being like, you have a very expensive item on your person right"
08:44;08:49;"now. And I'm aware of it. Just want you to know. And the guys that are just silently watching you"
08:49;08:55;"closely, not saying a word. The creepiest of all. You feel their eyes on you. You know,"
08:55;08:59;"it's just it seems stressful. And then before you know it, it's the whole grocery store because you"
08:59;09:03;"have this whole other category of people who they weren't thinking twice about your green shoes,"
09:03;09:07;"but they noticed that weird energy that aura surrounding you. And then they're just they"
09:07;09:10;"become looky loose. What's going on with this guy with this guy? This green"
09:10;09:16;"pandemonium, pandemonium, just pandemonium at the Mill Valley."
09:16;09:25;"But again, now the stress of knowing that I have this expensive item in my home, can I really wear"
09:25;09:31;"it? And then also I do also feel, you know, I've said before, I am a fan of Nike and the fact that"
09:31;09:35;"they sent me these out of the blue. Obviously, they're not time crisis listeners. Otherwise,"
09:35;09:39;"they probably might have sent me the chunky donkeys instead of these. But either way,"
09:39;09:44;"they might know that I'm a fan of the Grateful Dead. Now, even though I've, you know, been"
09:44;09:49;"somewhat critical this shoe on the program, as we all have, by the way, I was just going along"
09:49;09:58;"with what Jake said. I love him. It's like when you watch that bully on the playground,"
09:58;10:04;"you didn't stand up for Nike when I was when I was back. You didn't have the spine to stand up"
10:04;10:09;"for that. It's the same thing. I was just so shocked by the premise of your argument. I was"
10:09;10:14;"went down an intellectual rabbit hole and I couldn't do the right thing. We can share the"
10:14;10:25;"women. We can share the wine. We can share what we got to use because we got to share all the"
10:25;10:51;"bad. Keep on rolling. Just to go. Keep on rolling. Much to. So, Nick, you have a pair of the Crocs,"
10:51;10:58;"right? Yeah. The Grateful Dead Crocs. So that's Chinatown Market, which is frankly, I think,"
10:58;11:03;"you know, Seinfeld might know a bit more about the company, but they're sort of like a"
11:03;11:11;"local L.A. I mean, do you call it streetwear? Online online ceramics. Yeah, it's an it's an"
11:11;11:16;"L.A. company. Yeah, they're kind of an emerging streetwear brand. They do a lot of collaborations."
11:16;11:23;"And so they released I guess they did their own collaboration with Grateful Dead and sort of I"
11:23;11:30;"think their look is a little more like less sort of dark, cool kind of online ceramics. It's like"
11:30;11:36;"pretty bright and vibrant and fun. Their logo is like a happy face. And so they did their their"
11:36;11:44;"Crocs that they did are like tie dyed Crocs, like tie dyed printed Crocs with the what did you guys"
11:44;11:48;"told me what they were called? What are those little like bits that you put on the Crocs?"
11:48;11:53;"Giblets? No, they're not called giblets. Well, the official term is giblets."
11:53;12:01;"They got a marching bear giblets. They got some rock climbing, the colorful holes that you hold."
12:01;12:09;"Yeah. And also just people understand if you're not a Crocs wearer giblets are basically flare"
12:09;12:14;"for your Crocs because you can picture a pair of Crocs. It has a bunch of holes in it. Right."
12:14;12:20;"So if you want to customize it, you can buy giblets either official or I'm sure unofficial"
12:20;12:25;"online. It could be flare that represents your personality. It could be I mean,"
12:25;12:28;"Vampire Weekend should probably start making some. I bet we have a lot of fans who wear Crocs."
12:28;12:32;"I've looked through like a big pile of them before where it's like anything you like. So,"
12:32;12:37;"you know, if if you know, if I was trying to decorate Jake's Crocs, maybe I'd find a paint"
12:37;12:44;"brush or artist palette, maybe a dog because you're a dog owner. Very cool. Maybe a guitar."
12:44;12:51;"This sounds so cool. Actually, if you ever need a cheap gift to give somebody,"
12:51;12:56;"but you can't afford to get them a pair of Crocs, just get them like three giblets that reflect"
12:56;13:00;"the things that they're into. And if they say, what am I supposed to do with them?"
13:00;13:04;"So put them on your Crocs. And if they say, well, I don't have any Crocs, be like, oh,"
13:04;13:09;"darn it. I thought you did. I'm on the Crocs giblets website. There are some pretty Jake"
13:09;13:14;"centric giblets here. There's a mountain range. I don't even know what Crocs look like. Oh,"
13:14;13:19;"come on. That's that's like a Birkenstock. You must know. I mean, they actually feel like a"
13:19;13:26;"painter's shoe. It's like a clog. Picture like a clog with like a rounded foot, except it's made"
13:26;13:31;"out of a kind of rubbery plastic and there's a series of holes in it. Oh, just look up Crocs"
13:31;13:36;"real quick. If you see these right now and say, I've never seen that in my life. This is like"
13:36;13:42;"Mariah Carey. All I want for Christmas level of checked out in this. I'll be very impressed."
13:42;13:47;"Oh, no. Yeah. I've seen those. I think of those as like, I'm trying to think like where I've"
13:47;13:51;"seen them, like do like people like in ERs wear them or like, no, like nurses."
13:51;13:56;"They might. Yeah. They're really comfortable. I think you're right, Jake. I think it is a"
13:56;14:03;"medical community type of shoe and and chefs and I would say painters. It's people that are on their"
14:03;14:07;"feet all day. Right. You know what I was thinking of getting, you know, like kitchens and restaurants,"
14:07;14:13;"there's they have like those that like thick rubber mat that's like an inch thick. Oh, yeah."
14:13;14:18;"I'm getting some of those because I'm usually standing in the same spot for like hours on end."
14:18;14:24;"So maybe I'll get one of those like inch thick, like kitchen mats and some Crocs."
14:25;14:31;"That's going to be heaven for your knees. Yeah, I find that like after standing for like three or"
14:31;14:36;"four hours in concrete wearing like beat up running shoes like and I'm here I am in my mid 40s almost,"
14:36;14:44;"you know, the backs are hurt. All of that. Yeah. So just switching gears. What so what do you think"
14:44;14:50;"that the backstory is with? So so I think taking a half hour, I think that would happen is that"
14:50;14:57;"there's this company Chinatown Market who made the collab, the Grateful Dead collab, Crocs and"
14:57;15:02;"gibbets. But they also did the sweatshirt and shorts that he was wearing. So somehow they"
15:02;15:09;"reached out to him. So they must have reached out to him. I have to think, though, that having"
15:09;15:18;"LeBron James during a finals game, well, yeah, with it all on is got to be one of the biggest"
15:18;15:23;"possible things to happen. I can't imagine they expected that they don't have that kind of weight,"
15:23;15:28;"you know, so I think that he must have a pair of stuff the way that Ezra gets a pair."
15:28;15:33;"But instead of looking at the green fuzzy chunky donkey going, I don't know if I'll wear this."
15:33;15:38;"He literally must have seen it and go, I'm just going to wear it all. I wonder if LeBron has"
15:38;15:42;"talked Grateful Dead with Bill Walton. Well, that's the big question is all these people are"
15:42;15:49;"tagging me. And clearly he's making huge waves wearing this outfit. Is there any information"
15:49;15:54;"that LeBron wore this outfit for a specific reason? Was he playing somewhere that had like"
15:54;16:00;"some Grateful Dead history? Oh, no. All the games are happening in the bubble, right?"
16:00;16:01;"Florida."
16:01;16:06;"I mean, the dead played there, but it's not particularly like dead country. I mean,"
16:06;16:10;"when did this happen? Yeah, he missed the days between by, you know, a few weeks. So that's"
16:10;16:14;"not what it was. So maybe he did just get it in the mail and he just wanted to throw it on. He"
16:14;16:19;"thought it looked cool. So yeah, that's a huge look for the, for Chinatown market. It's also"
16:19;16:25;"interesting the way that it works now where it's like, so Chinatown market teams up with the"
16:25;16:31;"Grateful Dead. Clearly Grateful Dead organization is very into like launching products lately."
16:31;16:36;"It's really like a lot at once. But anyway, it's interesting that I wonder what the backstory is"
16:36;16:40;"that Chinatown market, like maybe they're dead heads or they're fans or whatever. They're like"
16:40;16:43;"hit up the dead or the dead hits them up. Like, let's do something together."
16:43;16:48;"You guys make like cool, but then Chinatown market says, yeah, we should do a crock."
16:48;16:53;"So now you're bringing this like third party into it because the shoe is Chinatown market,"
16:53;16:54;"ex Grateful Dead, ex Crocs."
16:54;16:55;"Sounds complicated."
16:55;17:01;"They had to broker the deal. Yeah. Like Grateful Dead and Crocs negotiations had broken down many"
17:01;17:06;"times over the past five years. And Chinatown market invites them to Camp David to like hash"
17:06;17:10;"things out. Like you would think that a Grateful Dead crock would have been way before there's a"
17:10;17:15;"Grateful Dead skateboarding Nike dunk. There might've been a Grateful Dead crock and yet"
17:15;17:20;"took Chinatown market to put this together. And maybe ultimately Chinatown market is not,"
17:20;17:24;"it's just trying to do their own cool line. Cause Nick, you talked about the fact that"
17:24;17:29;"some of the gibbets on the Grateful Dead crock are climbing wall holds."
17:29;17:31;"Yes. Climbing wall holds, which I've never seen."
17:31;17:36;"Yeah. Well, that's funny because it's like, it is kind of like a weird crunchy symbol."
17:36;17:40;"Like you can imagine there being like a person who's, oh, I'm a dead head. And it's like,"
17:40;17:43;"well, what do you do on the weekends? Like, honestly, man, throwing my earbuds,"
17:43;17:50;"I throw on a spring 90 show and I just hit my local climbing wall. And you might be like,"
17:50;17:55;"yeah, all right. That all kind of makes sense to me. But there's no direct connection between"
17:55;18:00;"climbing walls and the Grateful Dead. No, I appreciate the randomness of it."
18:00;18:04;"Just while we're on the topic, I would do also want to shout out Keen's because I do really"
18:04;18:10;"like the brand Keen. I also appreciate that this shoe they said is not Grateful Dead. It's Jerry"
18:10;18:16;"Garcia. There's nice attention to detail on the box. The paper inside the box has Jerry's hand"
18:16;18:21;"print with the missing finger on it. And this is what the actual shoe looks like. You know,"
18:21;18:28;"so Keen's, that's a real outdoorsy brand. They make these kind of also moccasin hiking shoe type"
18:28;18:33;"things. I actually, I wear a pair of Keen's every day. I got sent a pair from the Newport Folk"
18:33;18:38;"Festival because somebody from the Newport Folk Festival heard me talking on the podcast,"
18:38;18:43;"Throwing Fits. Shout out Throwing Fits. That's a fashion podcast. And I was talking a lot about"
18:43;18:47;"how I wanted to get a pair of Keen's and this person at the Newport Folk Festival heard it"
18:47;18:53;"and was like, you know, we have a custom Newport Folk Festival pair of Keen's. And I was like,"
18:53;18:58;"sick. And I wear them every day because you slide them right on. You can wear socks. You don't have"
18:58;19:03;"to. You could stomp through some water. They dry nice. It's a great shoe. But so this Jerry"
19:03;19:11;"Garcia one, it kind of appears to be tie-dyed. And you see here, you've got Jerry's hand with"
19:11;19:17;"the missing finger. I'm sorry, Jerry Garcia is missing a finger. Oh, wow. I had no idea."
19:17;19:22;"Forgive me. No, no, no. That's fine, Seinfeld. We know there's only room for one Jerry in your life."
19:22;19:26;"I don't know what happened to his finger. Was he born without one?"
19:26;19:31;"On this show, Jake brought in the dead. You brought in the Seinfeld. So we got two Jerry's."
19:31;19:37;"Nick, you got to find a Jerry to rep. Salt. I do rep a Jerry Salt. Oh, you got Jerry Salt."
19:37;19:46;"And maybe I need a Jerry too. Jerry Heller, former manager of Eazy-E. Jerry Garcia actually"
19:46;19:52;"had a very traumatic childhood, Seinfeld. Within a span of, I think, a few years as a kid,"
19:52;19:58;"he watched his father drown in the Russian River in Northern California, where the Garcia family"
19:58;20:03;"had a kind of a little country house that the whole family would go out to. So he was fishing"
20:03;20:09;"with his dad and his father literally drowned in the river. What happened? I don't know if it's"
20:09;20:14;"anything other than some getting caught in the water. You don't think of that as a very treacherous"
20:14;20:19;"river. It's very placid. Maybe he hit his head. Maybe it was a stone. I don't know. But then"
20:19;20:25;"within the same few years, he and his brother, also probably out in the country because they"
20:25;20:29;"normally lived in the city in San Francisco at that phase of his life, he and his brother,"
20:29;20:34;"who's a little bit older, were horsing around. And the way his brother told the story is that"
20:34;20:42;"they were chopping wood and Jerry would put his finger on the stump as a joke and then somehow"
20:42;20:48;"through the horsing around, his brother actually cut off the middle finger of his right hand,"
20:48;20:54;"right? Of his right hand, which when you think about playing guitar is a way better place to"
20:54;20:59;"lose your middle finger than your left hand. If you're right handed. Yeah. If you're right"
20:59;21:03;"handed, because, you know, picture somebody playing guitar. If you're not a guitarist,"
21:03;21:07;"you know, your right hand just holds the pick. Most people only use their thumb and their"
21:07;21:12;"forefinger for the pick anyway. So you really only need two fingers. You can lose three fingers on"
21:12;21:16;"your right hand and still be decent at guitar. And then as long as you have access to your whole"
21:16;21:21;"left hand, you could be shredding up and down the neck. It would be really crazy if he played the"
21:21;21:25;"way he did and he was missing the middle finger on his left hand. You know, it's crazy, man. If"
21:25;21:30;"he had lost that finger on his left hand, the Grateful Dead might not exist. It would have"
21:30;21:35;"been harder for him to find his voice on the guitar, missing a finger. Goes to show, man,"
21:35;21:42;"history and life are super random. And then there would be no Crocs. No Crocs. I mean,"
21:42;21:49;"there'd be no time crisis. Let's be honest. It's true. What would this show be about if"
21:49;21:54;"the dead never existed? I never started Richard Pictures. Right. Father of the Bride is a"
21:54;22:00;"completely different album. You've said so yourself, dude. Richard Pictures was a huge"
22:00;22:06;"influence on Father. Absolutely. We would just be a couple boring ass dudes talking about plain Crocs."
22:06;22:13;"Yeah, but think about that. You're just a kid horsing around with your brother who's holding"
22:13;22:17;"an axe. What if his hand had been out a little bit further and his whole right hand had been"
22:17;22:22;"chopped off? Yep. I don't see him becoming the greatest guitar player of all time that way."
22:22;22:25;"Yeah. Or he's just horsing around the other hand. So many things could have happened."
22:25;22:30;"You know, I went to elementary school with a kid named Lawrence who lost his finger"
22:30;22:36;"by sticking it into a bicycle spoke that was moving. A bike had gone by and he stuck his"
22:36;22:42;"finger in when he was six or something. No, no, no. Oh my God. Brutal. I'll never forget it."
22:42;22:47;"You knew him before and after. No, I only knew him after. Oh, after. He was on my school bus and I"
22:47;22:53;"was like, what happened? And he said, I stuck my finger into a moving bicycle wheel. Oh my God."
22:53;22:58;"It was his baby finger. It was pinky. Oh, is that a Canadian thing? Calling it a baby finger?"
22:58;23:04;"I, you know, I don't know anymore. It's a baby toe, right? Yeah, it's a baby toe. But you call"
23:04;23:09;"pinky a baby finger? I never heard that. Or maybe I'm conflating it with Trump or something. I don't"
23:09;23:13;"know. Maybe it's a Canadian thing. But the last thing I'll say about this pair of Jerry Garcia"
23:13;23:18;"Keens is that I said they appear to be tie-dye, but they're not tie-dye. And this threw me for"
23:18;23:25;"a loop. And this also, I thought was a kind of a nice detail is that this shoe, I can't tell exactly"
23:25;23:30;"what the name is. Maybe it's called the Jerry Garcia Excelsior, but it's actually based on one"
23:30;23:36;"of his paintings. So it's not just random tie-dye, it's based on a painting he did. And you know"
23:36;23:42;"what this painting is called? In the city? Good guess, Jake, because I have no idea what it is."
23:42;23:47;"It's called New York at Night. Yeah, it looks like a cityscape. Yeah. So it's interesting that"
23:47;23:52;"this Jerry Garcia shoe has a weird connection to New York, a city the dead played many times,"
23:52;23:59;"but not a city you necessarily associate with him as a person. So this seemingly tie-dye Jerry"
23:59;24:02;"sandal has that New York nighttime energy."
24:26;24:31;"I wonder if anything will come of LeBron wearing this other than an uptick in sales for Chinatown"
24:31;24:36;"Market. I wonder if anybody's like, ""Who are those bears?"" I wonder if it gets more people"
24:36;24:41;"listening to the dead. Probably slight uptick for, you know, a day or two. And we've talked on the"
24:41;24:45;"show before about the fact that more than any other sport, there seems to be a basketball"
24:45;24:50;"Grateful Dead connection. Celtics player Jason Tatum has been on that Grateful Dead wave for a"
24:50;24:56;"little while. Is he a fan? He's a fan of the merchandising. I don't know about his musical"
24:56;25:02;"taste, but he wore the shoes that you have and he wore some jeans six months ago that have the"
25:02;25:09;"bears on them too. $1,500 Amiri jeans. Like I've said before, I think it's like silly that there"
25:09;25:14;"are people on like comment sections being like, ""This shoe is not in the spirit of the Grateful"
25:14;25:18;"Dead,"" when the truth is the Grateful Dead's been making original merchandise forever."
25:18;25:23;"They've never been like crazy purists. I wonder if there's ever been like a successful musician"
25:23;25:30;"who was like, ""I'm not doing t-shirts, man. I do one thing. Let's make music. You can listen to it"
25:30;25:36;"on the record. You can come see me in concert, but I'm not the f***ing Gap, okay? I'm not going to"
25:36;25:42;"waste my valuable time creating t-shirts for you to adorn your body with because as soon as you do"
25:42;25:48;"that, you're taking the image and you're taking away the beating heart of it, which is the music."""
25:48;25:52;"Who would do that? We would never hear of them because you need t-shirts to make it in this town."
25:53;25:59;"I could be wrong here, but I feel like merch was not really a thing in like the 60s and maybe early"
25:59;26:05;"70s. Definitely by the late 70s, it was like Kiss and everything. But like, if you felt like the"
26:05;26:12;"Doors in 1970, were they selling like Doors t-shirts? I don't know."
26:12;26:16;"That's a great question. By the 70s, you see pictures of kids in parking lots and they're"
26:16;26:23;"wearing like the Who baseball t-shirt. It existed, but were they selling it at the concerts in the"
26:23;26:29;"same quantities that they were by the 80s and 90s? They definitely made junky merchandise in the 60s."
26:29;26:35;"Go back as far as the early 60s, even the 50s. I think Elvis fans were buying like little plastic"
26:35;26:41;"weird things and there's Beatles junk. Yeah, there's definitely like lunch boxes and stuff,"
26:41;26:48;"but I don't think the t-shirt had the primacy though of being like the go-to merch item for"
26:48;26:52;"music in that era. But couldn't you see Jim Morrison doing that riff that you were doing"
26:52;27:01;"on stage? I don't want you to adorn a t-shirt with my image on it. Recently, the record company man"
27:01;27:07;"came to me and they said, ""Jim, we want to do a t-shirt."" And I said, ""Excuse me?"""
27:08;27:14;"""What is a t-shirt?"" Chinatown Market came to me and said, ""We want to do a line with you"
27:14;27:19;"and we want to make a Jim Morrison croc."" And I said, ""Why?"""
27:19;27:24;"I said, ""I'll pass on the crocs and the t-shirt, but I will take you up on the leather pants."""
27:24;27:26;"[Laughter]"
27:26;27:27;"T-shirt."
27:27;27:33;"I know. It's the reason Jim Morrison pronounces t-shirt very formally and in a very stilted way."
27:33;27:34;"[Laughter]"
27:34;27:35;"T-shirts."
27:35;27:37;"It's a new technology, yeah."
27:37;27:42;"I think we're going a tiny bit Keanu. We're turning him into a little bit of like,"
27:42;27:45;"""What is this t-shirt?"""
27:45;27:48;"That would have been an interesting casting instead of Mal."
27:48;27:54;"Keanu? Yeah, absolutely. Keanu is Jim Morrison. There's always been something"
27:54;28:00;"funny to me about solo artists with their merch, which is funny to say now. It's funny to say now"
28:00;28:06;"that there's definitely like the solo artist is more like the archetypal artist compared to bands,"
28:06;28:11;"which used to be like, ""What bands do you like?"" Now it's like, ""What music do you like?"""
28:11;28:16;"But I can imagine there being something awkward about, yeah, if you're like Neil Young and"
28:16;28:20;"they're just like, ""Here's the designs, Neil, for the tour."" And it's just like a picture of"
28:20;28:26;"your big-ass face. And it's just like, ""Neil Young, 1987 North American tour."" I can imagine"
28:26;28:32;"just looking at that and just being like, ""This is f***ing weird."" I think part of the reason that"
28:32;28:38;"solo artist merch is so funny to me is that obviously with a band, the fact that the band"
28:38;28:44;"has a name and band names tend to be kind of bizarre, it feels more normal. It's just like"
28:44;28:50;"a brand. I guess it's the same way that probably back in the day, we take it for granted, but there"
28:50;28:57;"used to be so many jokes about designer jeans because people found it so funny. Whenever that"
28:57;29:02;"started in the '70s, like Gloria Vanderbilt or something like that, the idea that you would just"
29:02;29:08;"walk around with somebody else's name on your ass was so funny to people. I even feel like there's"
29:08;29:14;"a... Is that a Run-DMC? Some early rap song. I remember having a line about, ""I don't want"
29:14;29:19;"nobody's name on my behind."" Yeah, just imagine you're somebody who'd never seen that before,"
29:19;29:23;"even somebody who's kind of interested in fashion. And suddenly you have commercials"
29:23;29:28;"where people are being like, ""Nothing comes between me and my Calvins."" And then just this"
29:28;29:33;"big name, Calvin Klein, on the back. We're so numb to it now. When you hear the name Calvin"
29:33;29:38;"Klein, you don't even consider the fact that that's a dude from the Bronx. That's the Run-DMC"
29:38;29:43;"lyric, ""Calvin Klein's no friend of mine. Don't want nobody's name on my behind."" Oh, it is Calvin"
29:43;29:50;"Klein. So that's Run-DMC. Although they were happy to rep Adolf Dassler, aka Adidas. But of course,"
29:50;29:54;"when you wear Adidas, you're not thinking about the fact that there's an old German guy named"
29:54;29:59;"Adolf Dassler. Do you remember in Back to the Future? No, is there a joke about that? Yeah,"
29:59;30:05;"well, Marty goes back to 1955 and then he gets hit by a car and is knocked unconscious. And then"
30:05;30:10;"his mom, who's 17, brings him into the house. She's like, ""Calvin, are you okay?"" He's like,"
30:10;30:14;"""Why are you calling me Calvin?"" She's, ""Calvin Klein. It says all over your underwear. That's"
30:14;30:19;"your name, right?"" Oh, yeah, you're right. That's a really good joke. And also, that's some real"
30:19;30:24;"s***. That is probably what would happen if you went back in time wearing Calvin Klein underwear"
30:24;30:29;"and got hit by a car and your mom found you. Your 17-year-old mom found you. There is one band that"
30:29;30:36;"we have found that never made merch, and that's Fugazi. Never made merch? Wait, they didn't even"
30:36;30:42;"make T-shirts? Really? Never made merch. So much so, yes, that I've definitely seen a Fugazi T-shirt."
30:42;30:49;"Yes, all homemade. You know, there was a movie that Matthew McConaughey made called Mud. And"
30:49;30:54;"the character in Mud, they wanted to have a Fugazi shirt. And so it had to be homemade,"
30:54;31:00;"because there were none. And when they called Fugazi to get permission, they never got a call"
31:00;31:05;"back, and they couldn't get a shirt because they never made shirts. So there is documented,"
31:05;31:10;"Fugazi has never made their own merch, period. That's pretty hardcore."
31:11;31:14;"When we have nothing left to give"
31:14;31:20;"There'll be no reason for us to live"
31:20;31:25;"When we have nothing left to lose"
31:25;31:31;"You will have nothing left to use"
31:31;31:34;"We are nothing"
31:34;31:38;"You have no control"
31:38;31:39;"We are nothing"
31:39;31:43;"You have nothing to lose"
31:43;31:47;"Well, I'm going to do a hard left turn right now. We talked recently on the program about the TC"
31:47;31:52;"Book Club and the TC Book Club Civil War, and how just things really got out of control. But at"
31:52;31:58;"least two of us read the same book. And that's me and Jake. We both read Chaos, Charles Manson,"
31:58;32:03;"the CIA and the History of the '60s by Tom O'Neill. Jake, I believe you just finished it, right?"
32:03;32:05;"I did. I finished it a few days ago."
32:05;32:11;"We both love this book, and we're very lucky to have the author Tom O'Neill on the program."
32:11;32:17;"He's done some really in-depth interviews recently. If you want to hear him talk for a"
32:17;32:22;"really long time about the book, he was on Joe Rogan not that long ago. We got so many questions"
32:22;32:27;"for him. But above all, as we said last time, just to refresh your memory, one of the things that I"
32:27;32:32;"found so fascinating about Tom O'Neill is not just that he wrote a fascinating book. It's not a"
32:32;32:36;"conspiracy theorist book in the sense of being like an unhinged person just looking for clues."
32:36;32:43;"It's a very well-written, well-researched, sober analysis of inconsistencies in the official story"
32:43;32:48;"of what happened with Charles Manson. He's an incredibly restrained writer, actually."
32:48;32:54;"He refuses to make connections if he can't prove it. It's a very sober analysis of the story,"
32:54;32:58;"and you find out so much. But also, an amazing part of it, which I want to ask him about,"
32:58;33:04;"is the fact that this is a dude who started writing a magazine article in 1999 that was"
33:04;33:07;"supposed to take a couple months and ended up- For Premier Magazine."
33:07;33:12;"For Premier Magazine, which no longer exists. Just trying to write something about the 30th"
33:12;33:17;"anniversary of the Manson murders. Well, he got his book out in time for the 50th anniversary"
33:17;33:23;"because he spent 20 years doggedly pursuing this story. Anyway, we're very lucky to have him on,"
33:23;33:27;"so let's get Tom on the phone. Now, let's go to the Time Crisis"
33:27;33:32;"Hotline. Hey, Tom."
33:32;33:36;"Hi, how you doing? Hey, how's it going? Welcome to Time Crisis."
33:36;33:42;"Oh, thanks for having me. How you guys doing? Oh, not bad. I'm Ezra, and that's my co-host,"
33:42;33:46;"Jake. Hey. Where are you calling from, Tom? Do you still live out by the beach?"
33:46;33:50;"I live in Los Angeles, but I'm in New Jersey right now, South Jersey."
33:50;33:55;"My folks have a house in Cape May, and I'm visiting some of the family here,"
33:55;34:01;"sitting out on the deck to try to keep it quiet. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, you grew up in Philly, right?"
34:01;34:05;"Yeah, yeah, in Philadelphia. Very cool. Well, so Jake and I are both huge"
34:05;34:11;"fans of the book, and I just want to start out by congratulating you on what really is just a"
34:11;34:12;"massive achievement. Thank you."
34:12;34:19;"Your incredible research over 20 years. I mean, so many questions. It's hard to know where to begin,"
34:19;34:25;"but maybe just for our listeners, we kind of gave them the basic backstory about how you were"
34:25;34:30;"contracted to write something about the 30th anniversary of the Madsen-Murgister Premier"
34:30;34:36;"Magazine all the way back in 1999. Could you maybe tell us one of the first turning points"
34:36;34:41;"in your research where you realized this was more than a magazine article that you'd be able"
34:41;34:46;"to hand in after a few months? I guess the first time it kind of occurred"
34:46;34:51;"to me that things were a little bit out of whack with the official narrative was my first meeting"
34:51;34:58;"with the prosecutor, Vincent Bogliosi, who also wrote the book Helter Skelter about the case,"
34:58;35:04;"you know, about the crimes, the investigation and the trial and the aftermath. So he very"
35:04;35:10;"graciously invited me to his house, spent about six hours with me discussing the case. And,"
35:10;35:15;"you know, I'd read Helter Skelter for the first time. I was never interested in the crimes or the"
35:15;35:20;"case. I only did it because, you know, I had an assignment and I had to do some background."
35:20;35:26;"And I knew enough then at the end of that day that he hadn't told me anything, kind of. They"
35:26;35:32;"hadn't already told a million times in documentaries and his own book and speaking engagements."
35:32;35:39;"So at the very end of the interview, I did what we call the ""Hail Mary"" pass, where I said to him,"
35:39;35:44;"""Look, I'd love if you could share something with me that's never been reported about this before."""
35:44;35:50;"It's 30 years later and I just don't want to do, you know, a rehash here. And we could go off the"
35:50;35:55;"record if you'd like. So he thought about it for a minute or two and then he said, ""Turn off your"
35:55;36:00;"recorder."" And he told me an anecdote. Well, he told me about some evidence that had been taken"
36:00;36:08;"from the scene that he had represented as something quite different in his book. At the time, it was"
36:08;36:15;"salacious and kind of fascinating and also pretty horrible. But I didn't know that it had, you know,"
36:15;36:21;"any repercussions except for the fact that it nagged at me that he was kind of acknowledging"
36:21;36:29;"that he changed one fact in the case. And that kind of later on in the following weeks, when I"
36:29;36:36;"was doing more and more interviews, reading more documents and seeing discrepancies and anomalies"
36:36;36:41;"and stuff, I kept going back to that and thinking, ""Well, if he changed that, you know, what else did"
36:41;36:50;"he change?"" And that kind of opened a door into a world of kind of astonishment on my part that"
36:50;36:57;"something that everybody thought they knew so well had been actually manufactured significantly."
36:57;37:04;"And the truth was very different than what was told. And it's one thing if you do it in a book,"
37:04;37:09;"it's another thing if you do it in a trial where people's lives are at stake. And no matter what"
37:09;37:15;"you think about the defendants, Charlie and his followers, they deserve the presumption of"
37:15;37:23;"innocence and also a fair trial. And the death penalty was at play. So the fact that he fabricated"
37:23;37:30;"evidence, suborn perjury, withheld evidence, and did all these things seemed really important to me."
37:30;37:35;"That kind of sent me off in what became, you know, I had no idea at the time that a three-month"
37:35;37:40;"magazine assignment was going to turn into a 20-year odyssey. But that was kind of the first"
37:40;37:45;"kind of ""Oh, s***"" moment where I'm like, ""There's something going on here that I got to figure out"
37:45;37:47;"what it means."""
37:47;37:52;"And that's something that I've been very curious about, because your background at the time,"
37:52;37:57;"so most of your adult life until you started this article, you'd been writing a lot about the"
37:57;38:01;"entertainment industry. You'd primarily been a magazine writer."
38:01;38:07;"Yeah, I had written mostly about celebrities and film and television production. Before that,"
38:07;38:13;"I had done a little bit of kind of general news reporting for the Village Voice and the New York"
38:13;38:20;"Daily News. But I kind of had made my mark and made a living in entertainment journalism. And"
38:20;38:26;"the magazine I was working for, where I was on the masthead, was called Us Magazine. It still"
38:26;38:32;"exists today. But when I worked there, which was until I got shortly before I started this,"
38:32;38:36;"it was a monthly magazine. Jan Wenner, the owner of Rolling Stone, owned it."
38:36;38:41;"And we actually did long stories. I was doing 5,000-word pieces. And I started doing"
38:41;38:46;"investigative pieces about the entertainment industry, which were a big relief for me,"
38:46;38:50;"because I was really getting burnt out on talking to movie stars about their movie"
38:50;38:57;"theses and kind of stroking egos and stuff to get information. And then Jan sold the—or he"
38:57;39:02;"didn't sell the magazine, but he revamped it and turned it into a weekly, much more tabloidy kind"
39:02;39:07;"of thing. So I let my contract go, and a bunch of other people did. And they all went to a film"
39:07;39:13;"magazine called Premiere. So this was the assignment I got from them. But in between,"
39:13;39:19;"there's a magazine called Details. I did do my first true crime story for them. I reported on"
39:19;39:26;"a woman who was murdered in California, who was Miss Hollywood. It was an unsolved murder. It was"
39:26;39:29;"a pretty amazing story. - That's Rebecca Schaeffer?"
39:29;39:31;"- No, no. I actually done a story. - Oh, that's a different story?"
39:31;39:34;"- That was a story about celebrity stalkers. So yeah, I guess actually that was kind of a"
39:34;39:40;"true crime story too. But this was about an unknown woman from Michigan who had moved out"
39:40;39:47;"to Los Angeles to be the next Madonna, and she just wasn't talented. Got kind of corrupted by"
39:47;39:54;"the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood and ended up being stabbed and left in a lot in Fresno."
39:54;40:00;"Wasn't even discovered for two or three days. And the weird coincidence was her body was found"
40:00;40:06;"50 years to the day that the Black Dahlia murder occurred in Hollywood. And the parallels between"
40:06;40:12;"the two cases were kind of fascinating. And I was really kind of frustrated because I never saw"
40:13;40:18;"her murder, and I kept thinking I was onto it. And it began, what I had no idea was going to"
40:18;40:24;"become a pattern in my life of going way too deep into a story and letting it take over."
40:24;40:30;"Luckily, that one was only about six months. But after what happened with the next job, I look back"
40:30;40:34;"in retrospect and think, ""Ah, yeah, that's where it all began when I couldn't solve it."" Her name"
40:34;40:48;"was Jill Weatherwax. [Music]"
40:48;41:02;"[Applause]"
41:26;41:31;"One thing that I think is very cool about your writing style is that you deeply are not a"
41:31;41:36;"conspiracy theorist. And I've seen in your other interviews, you've referenced the fact that"
41:36;41:42;"you've gotten some criticism for it because there's a frustration in this era of so many"
41:42;41:48;"true crime docs and podcasts and stuff. A lot of people want to be able to walk away from a book"
41:48;41:53;"saying, ""And that's what really happened."" Because it's become entertainment for people. So it's"
41:53;41:58;"really fun the same way that you would watch, you would read a mystery novel. You want to find out"
41:58;42:03;"who did it in the end, and that's the satisfaction. But that's not exactly,"
42:03;42:06;"you're a little too rigorous for that. Is that fair to say?"
42:06;42:12;"Yeah. Well, that's again, it's also why it took 20 years because I did think, I kept thinking"
42:12;42:17;"I was just around the corner from finding the truth. And I think like five or six years into"
42:17;42:23;"this after I'd already accumulated quite a bit of debt and a number of enemies and stuff. And my"
42:23;42:29;"agent just said to me, he goes, ""You might never find the smoking gun. You've got a lot of little"
42:29;42:37;"smoking pistols."" He said, ""Just present everything you have that undoes the kind of acceptance story,"
42:37;42:44;"and that's enough."" And it took me a while to agree to it. And then once I did, another five"
42:44;42:49;"years later, probably, then I was able to, well, I had the help of a great collaborator, figure out"
42:49;42:55;"how to do it and how to present it without resolution. And a lot of the criticism of the"
42:55;43:02;"book is that, but luckily I think a lot of people get it that I could speculate a lot more and be"
43:02;43:07;"much more conspiratorial and present something that has a beginning and a middle and an end."
43:07;43:13;"But I think there's just as many people who are happy to be kind of respected enough to not be"
43:14;43:20;"spoonfed and let them reach their own conclusions. I'm hoping, and it might be a little grandiose on"
43:20;43:26;"my part, but I'm hoping that the stuff that I put out there into the world is followed up with other"
43:26;43:34;"people independently or journalists or investigators who take kind of the path I laid and keep going,"
43:34;43:39;"and maybe find the answer at some point. Or maybe I kept thinking I was never going to do anything"
43:39;43:44;"on this subject after the book came out, but sure enough, I think I'm going to be doing a second book"
43:44;43:49;"or something like that. Also about the Manson murders or- A lot of the stuff that didn't end"
43:49;43:55;"up in the book, it still kills me because I think a lot of it's real important. That's amazing. So"
43:55;44:00;"one of the most fascinating things that, when I'm trying to explain what's interesting about this"
44:00;44:05;"book to people, and the first thing I tell them is, first of all, did you know that Charles Manson"
44:05;44:10;"and his followers were arrested many times before and after the murders and always seemed to be"
44:10;44:15;"let go? Which most people don't know. So that's very strange, right? And the fact that you"
44:15;44:20;"diligently uncovered so much of that, at the very least, proves that there was something weird"
44:20;44:24;"happening there. But one of the most fascinating things, which the book is named after, is the fact"
44:24;44:30;"that CIA had this Operation Chaos, which the public knows some details about, but as you say in the"
44:30;44:37;"book, a lot of the files were destroyed. But in the same month, the FBI started their COINTELPRO"
44:37;44:43;"program again, and the CIA started Chaos, and they both happened to open their first offices"
44:43;44:48;"in San Francisco. You also talk about that it's been widely underreported that Charles Manson and"
44:48;44:55;"the family spent a whole year in San Francisco before going down to LA. And you very elegantly"
44:55;45:00;"trace his steps and talk about the people he came into contact with, some of whom did have"
45:00;45:06;"connections to the CIA, and perhaps to the MKULTRA program. This is just something that I happened to"
45:06;45:10;"be thinking, because I was watching this movie, and in some ways I'm just interested in this time"
45:10;45:17;"period. So there was the same week that the Manson murders happened, one of the other most infamous"
45:17;45:23;"serial killers of all time, the Zodiac Killer, sent his first letter to the San Francisco Chronicle"
45:23;45:31;"on August 1st, 1969. At the very least, on this show, we mostly talk about the Grateful Dead and"
45:31;45:36;"McDonald's, so we're just about vibes here, to a large extent. I'm definitely not trying to say,"
45:36;45:42;"""Prove to me that the Zodiac Killer had something to do with MKULTRA,"" but I was just curious,"
45:42;45:47;"because one thing I love about the book is you just give people an insight into what the vibe"
45:47;45:53;"was. This period in American history, this period in California, this period in LA, did that ever"
45:53;45:58;"cross your radar that, I mean, obviously August 1969, it's a hell of a month, but Woodstock was"
45:58;46:04;"that month too. For some reason, I just suddenly was picturing, you're just somebody living in"
46:04;46:10;"California, your local respected newspaper gets sent a cipher from a weird serial killer that"
46:10;46:15;"people at home are trying to decode, and they're scared he's going to kill again, and then on"
46:15;46:20;"August 8th, a history teacher and his wife crack the code, and you're kind of like, ""Okay, maybe"
46:20;46:25;"that's going to be the end of that."" The next day, you hear about four people ritually murdered in"
46:25;46:30;"Los Angeles. Are there any connections to that? I know you don't mention the book, but that must"
46:30;46:35;"have felt like a truly psychotic moment in American history, all these things happening at the same"
46:35;46:39;"time. Did you have any leads related to that? Are there people who believe there's a connection?"
46:39;46:46;"Yeah, yeah. There are people out there who have been spending as much time as I spent on this,"
46:46;46:53;"my 20 years, double that on trying to connect the Zodiac to the Manson family. There's a couple of"
46:53;46:59;"serious researchers who started writing me probably in the early 2000s when they heard about"
46:59;47:06;"what I was doing. Most of them are convinced that Bruce Davis, who was one of Manson's followers,"
47:06;47:13;"was a Zodiac killer or was somehow working in tandem with a Zodiac killer. Davis is a really"
47:13;47:19;"interesting, strange character. He's actually, I think, the only family member that I interviewed"
47:19;47:28;"in prison face-to-face. I didn't ask him if he was a Zodiac killer. I knew going in, I'd learned by"
47:28;47:33;"then that it's hard to get them to say anything off script from what they've said in all their"
47:33;47:39;"parole hearings. Because if they give you any kind of new information and you publish it, then the"
47:39;47:42;"first thing the parole board's going to say, if it's important information, is, ""Why did you"
47:42;47:48;"withhold that? Because we give you an opportunity."" I mean, some of these guys like Tex and he have"
47:48;47:53;"had 30 or 40 parole hearings at this point. I looked into it a little bit, and it's one of"
47:53;47:58;"those things that I knew that if I looked into it anymore, I'd never finish the book."
47:58;48:05;"So there's some validity to Davis's kind of, some of the stuff he was up to, and none of it's in the"
48:05;48:12;"book. At the time, he was suspected in a couple other murders. I didn't get enough kind of"
48:12;48:18;"documentation that any of it was valid enough to pursue, but I did keep in touch with a couple of"
48:18;48:23;"the researchers, and I shared information with them. I actually, it occurs to me now, I haven't"
48:23;48:28;"heard from them since the book came out. I'm curious if they've read the book and if it's"
48:28;48:32;"helped or hurt. I think if it helped, I would have heard from them, but, or they could be dead,"
48:32;48:34;"because they've been doing it a long time. A lot of these people died."
48:34;48:36;"- Right, that's what I'm talking about."
48:36;48:41;"And also, one question, and Jake, you brought this up when we first talked about the book,"
48:41;48:48;"is were you at all thinking or haunted by the figure of Robert Graysmith, who was portrayed"
48:48;48:54;"by Jake Gyllenhaal in the Zodiac movie, who also ended up writing a big book and uncovering a lot"
48:54;48:59;"of information? He was a cartoonist in San Francisco who ended up also dedicating a lot of"
48:59;49:04;"his life to writing about an infamous serial killer. - Yeah, that did haunt me. I didn't know"
49:04;49:10;"a whole lot about Zodiac until I started getting these, you know, correspondences. So I read the"
49:10;49:16;"book and then I saw David Fincher's movie, which was fantastic. And what was interesting is David"
49:16;49:24;"Fincher's parents are very close to Roger Smith. If you remember, Roger Smith was Manson's federal"
49:24;49:27;"parole officer in San Francisco. - Wait, they knew him personally?"
49:27;49:32;"- Yeah, yeah. In fact, Roger Smith told me that in one of my first meetings with him. I can't"
49:32;49:36;"remember how it came up, but he talked about knowing them back then. And he wanted to know"
49:36;49:42;"if I knew David Fincher, 'cause I lived in LA. And I said, ""No, I never met him or anything."""
49:42;49:47;"I almost called not him, but his parents, because I think they were even friends with"
49:47;49:54;"Smith around the time he was supervising Manson. And I didn't, you know, it just seemed out of line"
49:54;49:58;"at the time. Actually, it's one of those things now I should now go back and look and see exactly"
49:58;50:03;"what Roger said to me. And maybe, I don't know if Fincher's parents are still alive. I have no"
50:03;50:09;"idea if David Fincher's even aware of that or aware of my book. But yeah, I'm sure his parents"
50:09;50:14;"probably told him, 'cause he's the kind of guy who's probably curious about something like that"
50:14;50:19;"in their history. So I'd love to hear what he thought of his parents' relationship."
50:19;50:23;"- That must've been trippy for you, 'cause Zodiac, when did that come out? Like 2007?"
50:23;50:25;"- Yeah. - Something like that?"
50:25;50:29;"So I'm just picturing, here you are eight years deep on this book,"
50:29;50:34;"like smack in the middle of this journey. And as you talk about in the book, a lot of times"
50:34;50:38;"you're questioning yourself, if you were making the right decision by doggedly pursuing it."
50:38;50:45;"And eight years deep, a movie comes out directed by a guy whose parents were friends with Charles"
50:45;50:52;"Manson's parole officer. That's about a guy whose life gets crazy as he writes a book about the"
50:52;50:54;"Zodiac killer. - Exactly."
50:54;50:56;"- That must've been wild to see that at that moment in your life."
50:56;51:01;"- Yeah, I remember being kind of awed by the movie, 'cause the movie was so well done,"
51:01;51:07;"but also being horrified by it. I kept saying, ""Everything doesn't have to be about me."""
51:07;51:13;"Stop being so self-centered and just enjoy the movie. But yeah, it was a weird kind of coincidence."
51:13;51:19;"The same thing happened when I read Michelle McNamara's book. I still haven't seen the"
51:19;51:23;"documentary, which I heard is pretty good. But I think I read that before my, I think her book"
51:23;51:29;"came out shortly before mine. I'm still not sure how she died, but I think she just got so caught"
51:29;51:35;"up in the horror of what happened to all these women and trying to nail down who did what,"
51:35;51:42;"who was the killer. So I see myself in all those kinds of people and get scared."
51:42;51:47;"And a couple of times, I can't remember examples right now, but there were other books and movies"
51:47;51:52;"similar to that, kind of that genre. - I can only imagine. And also,"
51:52;51:56;"I was really struck by one part of the book, because I think one thing that's so cool about"
51:56;52:01;"your book is that it's so, like we said, rigorously researched. And then there's a"
52:01;52:07;"tiny bit about your own life. Just maybe like 0.5% of the book is about what was happening with you"
52:07;52:13;"in your life. But it's the story of what you uncovered, but it's also the story of a person"
52:13;52:18;"who pursued something for 20 years. And there's one brief moment where you talk about this Don"
52:18;52:23;"DeLillo, 1988 novel, Libra, and you talk about this character, Nicholas Branch, a retired CIA"
52:23;52:31;"analyst, and how the agency paid for him to build a home office, which he described as the book-filled"
52:31;52:38;"room, the room of documents, the room of theories and dreams. And he says that he realizes that as"
52:38;52:43;"he's researching Lee Harvey Oswald, his ultimate subject isn't crime or politics, it's men in small"
52:43;52:49;"rooms. And you say you really identified with this character, the guy in the small room, just"
52:49;52:56;"keesing through endless documents, looking for the truth. And I mean, it is funny. I'm sure this is,"
52:56;53:01;"you've probably talked about this before, that as somebody who missed their deadline by 20 years,"
53:01;53:06;"you still weirdly, you know, talking about something that happened 50 years ago,"
53:06;53:12;"you still weirdly managed to get your book out in a moment when a story about somebody"
53:12;53:17;"pursuing the truth for 20 years has like this deeper resonance, you know, like,"
53:17;53:21;"look how much the world has changed in the 20 years you wrote that book. Like,"
53:21;53:28;"I imagine even your methods of research changed dramatically from 1999 till 2019 with access to"
53:28;53:32;"the internet and stuff. So I guess I'm also, this is maybe kind of a weird question, but"
53:32;53:40;"in the 20 years you spent researching something, thinking about various connections and the way"
53:40;53:44;"the world works, questioning if you're on the right path, but realizing how much time it takes"
53:44;53:49;"to sometimes uncover connections in the truth. Did you learn anything about the meaning of life?"
53:49;53:56;"Wow. Nobody's asked me that before. I got to think about it a second. I mean,"
53:56;53:58;"yeah, maybe that's too deep, but yeah."
53:58;54:03;"Well, no, no, it's a good question. I mean, believe me when I get something like that,"
54:03;54:08;"that I haven't thought about. I mean, I do write, I think, in the book about a really low moment in"
54:08;54:14;"my life when my first book publisher canceled the deal. And then they sued me for the return"
54:14;54:20;"of the advance, which was such a tremendous, not only setback, but crush to, you know,"
54:20;54:24;"it was just a blow. Cause I thought that the real reason they were canceling the book wasn't"
54:24;54:29;"because it was late, but because they thought I'd gone crazy or had lost faith in me. And I was"
54:29;54:35;"walking down the street with a friend and I really couldn't have been any lower. And he asked me if I"
54:35;54:40;"thought it was all worth it. And at that point it was 2013, I think. So I was like 14 years in"
54:40;54:46;"and I said, I wouldn't have traded those 13 previous years for the world because they were"
54:46;54:53;"the most exciting 13 years of my life because I was chasing something that I believe was important."
54:53;54:58;"And I had validation, but I kept finding stuff. It just took forever to find. Well, I think the"
54:58;55:04;"lesson, yeah, as perseverance pays off, if you trust your gut, but I sacrificed a lot, you know,"
55:04;55:08;"I missed so much in my life. Well, but the question about that specifically,"
55:08;55:12;"that's also interesting is that, so you were roughly 40 when this whole journey started,"
55:12;55:17;"right? Yeah, I was turned 40 the day, the day after my 40th birthday, I got the call"
55:17;55:21;"from premier magazine asking me to do this story. I guess it's also interesting too,"
55:21;55:26;"that, that you had described the, even though obviously it's tremendous ups and downs,"
55:26;55:32;"but there's very few people from any walks of life who described age 40 to 53 as the 13 most"
55:32;55:38;"exciting years of their life. And when you were in the previous year, you were doing stuff that"
55:38;55:42;"some people would think was very glamorous, like, you know, interviewing celebrities and stuff."
55:42;55:49;"And yet the next 13 years, it seems like you spent a lot of time taking old people to Denny's"
55:49;55:56;"and asking them questions, driving to God knows where middle of nowhere to find people. And yet"
55:56;56:03;"you found this purpose in middle age that ultimately you wouldn't have traded for anything"
56:03;56:07;"that kind of elevated your life in a sense. Yeah. And ironically, I was miserable most of"
56:07;56:14;"those 13 years. And I had, you know, so many moments where I questioned my sanity"
56:14;56:20;"and my reasons for doing it. But it's also in the book, I carried a list in my pocket of the"
56:20;56:26;"important fines I had. And, you know, nothing in, again, it sounds kind of presumptuous of me to"
56:26;56:33;"say, but nothing I had ever done prior to this book was important. I mean, relatively speaking,"
56:33;56:37;"I mean, I wrote really good stories, I think, especially some of the investigative pieces about"
56:37;56:42;"the industry. I wrote about sexism at Saturday Night Live, and I won a bunch of awards from a"
56:42;56:47;"bunch of women's organizations. That was all important. But there was nothing that, nothing"
56:47;56:52;"seemed, I mean, this was about the government and it was about malfeasance by people who were"
56:52;56:58;"supposed to trust, you know, law enforcement, the judicial system, you know, the people who"
56:58;57:05;"are supposed to protect us. And that was another life lesson. I mean, I naively went into this,"
57:05;57:11;"you know, I was raised by pretty left wing democratic parents and pretty open minded"
57:11;57:17;"and skeptical, but I was nowhere near skeptical enough when I encountered the cops and the"
57:17;57:24;"corruption in the courts and the cops and even the judges in this case to really believe it"
57:24;57:29;"could have happened because I did have a naivety that I don't have anymore. I'm much more"
57:29;57:48;"suspicious and cynical. So I guess that was a life lesson too."
57:50;58:19;"Tom, there was a really interesting"
58:19;58:23;"short section of the book that I wish I could read more about sometime,"
58:23;58:29;"which is when you hired a PI to help you track down former members of the family that were,"
58:29;58:35;"changed their name and were living in obscure places in the Pacific Northwest. What was that"
58:35;58:41;"like when you would show up at their house and knock on the door? What was going on with these"
58:41;58:48;"people? That was probably among the most fun, but also kind of scary. It wasn't just former"
58:48;58:54;"family members. It was also cops who were kind of living off the grid and people who were private"
58:54;59:00;"investigators, people who I knew I couldn't call and get to talk to me or talk honestly to me. I"
59:00;59:07;"had to show up. So, I mean, a couple of the Manson women who I think really got off easy, you know,"
59:07;59:12;"that I think they were much more involved in the murders and they were accessories. Two or three"
59:12;59:18;"in particular were kind of scary when I showed up at their houses. And one of them had some"
59:18;59:23;"scary sons who were all totted up. And I already knew about them because the sons had been in"
59:23;59:30;"prison and they were, you know, white supremacy guys and then those gangs. And then Steve Grogan,"
59:30;59:35;"who was the only Manson family member to be convicted of a murder who got paroled,"
59:35;59:40;"Clem or Scramblehead as they call them. You know, he married his prison psychiatrist,"
59:40;59:45;"changed his name to hers and had never been found since he was released from prison. And I think it"
59:45;59:52;"was like 79 or 80 until I went to his house and knocked on his door. And I mean, he bounded down"
59:52;59:58;"the stairs and I said, ""Mister,"" I can't remember what his fake name was, his wife's name. He said,"
59:58;01:00:03;"""Yeah, that's me."" I said, ""Well, I'm here to talk to you about your previous wife as Stephen"
01:00:03;01:00:08;"Grogan."" And he just went white. He goes, ""I don't know what you're talking about."" And I said,"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"""Come on, Clem, you know, I know who you are."" You know, he denied that he was Steve Grogan,"
01:00:12;01:00:17;"you know, and he was a very important family member. If you saw the Tarantino movie,"
01:00:17;01:00:22;"he was the one that Brad Pitt kicked the out of at Spahn Ranch after he had tried to hire"
01:00:22;01:00:28;"something. He was based on Clem. You know, I started pulling out my documents because I got"
01:00:28;01:00:34;"court records and birth dates and he kind of told me to leave the property or he was going to call"
01:00:34;01:00:39;"the police. And I said, ""But the police have, I don't think they're going to be too aggressive"
01:00:39;01:00:43;"with me, but I don't want you to do that. So I'll leave, but I'm coming back tomorrow to see if you"
01:00:43;01:00:48;"change your mind. So I'll come back around this time."" And I said, ""Here's my number. Here's a"
01:00:48;01:00:53;"hotel I'm staying in. If you can call me."" And I mean, two hours later, I got a cease and desist"
01:00:53;01:00:59;"letter from his attorney and I went back the next day and he wouldn't talk to me. So yeah,"
01:00:59;01:01:04;"there were a lot of people like him that I think are what I call the secret keepers,"
01:01:04;01:01:09;"Linda Kasabian, other family members who I think know the truth of this, but they'll never tell"
01:01:09;01:01:16;"it because it's going to implicate them in crimes that have no statute of limitations,"
01:01:16;01:01:31;"which is one crime, murder. - Right. That's incredible."
01:01:32;01:01:40;"- So Tom, you alluded to the fact that you're probably going to do another book. Do you have"
01:01:40;01:01:46;"a sense of what else comes next? In the book you talked about you'd had offers maybe to do some"
01:01:46;01:01:52;"type of TV series, which you'd passed up. - Yeah. Yeah. The filmmaker, Earl Morris,"
01:01:52;01:01:57;"wanted to do a documentary on the book and a little bit about it's in the book,"
01:01:57;01:02:02;"but I don't think I named him. He shot a, what do they call it? A teaser. He spent like two or"
01:02:02;01:02:09;"three days filming me at my house with a big crew and sold it to Netflix. And then long story short,"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"he and I had a falling out, kind of creative differences and he ended up doing Wormwood. I"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"don't know if you guys saw that. It was on Netflix about three or four years ago."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"- Right. Which is similar subject matter or related."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"- Yeah. It evolved out of the project he and I were doing. He actually,"
01:02:24;01:02:29;"I was talking a lot about the Frank Olson death and Eric Olson, the son, and he asked me to put"
01:02:29;01:02:34;"him in touch with Eric to see if he could get Eric to talk a little about it in the film he was doing"
01:02:34;01:02:39;"on me. And then all of a sudden he wanted to do both our stories together. And I just, you know,"
01:02:39;01:02:43;"my book wasn't published then. I was still getting sued. I didn't know if I was going to be able to"
01:02:43;01:02:48;"resell it. And I said, Earl, I'm not going to, as much as I love Eric and it's a great story,"
01:02:48;01:02:54;"I don't want to share my information with another story because I need to be the dedicated subject."
01:02:55;01:03:00;"So do Eric and I'm going to walk away. And that's what I did. But there is a deal that"
01:03:00;01:03:06;"Amazon optioned the book and there's a screenwriter who has just finished the script. And I heard"
01:03:06;01:03:11;"last week they're sending it out to directors and it's going to be, for better or worse,"
01:03:11;01:03:17;"I'm the protagonist in this thing. So it's going to be about me chasing the story. Yeah. But I'm"
01:03:17;01:03:22;"just a little worried because, you know, once Hollywood, you know, gets their hands on something"
01:03:22;01:03:27;"like this, then they start to change things. And I'm dreading reading the script when I finally"
01:03:27;01:03:32;"get it, but I hope it gets made because I'm still, yeah, we got to get Fincher on it."
01:03:32;01:03:38;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who knows? But yeah, it'll help me because I'm still really in debt from,"
01:03:38;01:03:45;"from all the lawsuits. Oh my God. That's amazing, man. What a journey. Well, I guess just the last"
01:03:45;01:03:52;"thing, and thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. We've referenced a lot and we've"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"talked about it in previous episodes, but in our conversation with you, we've, we've talked a lot"
01:03:55;01:03:59;"about MKUltra and you talked about your interest in Frank Olson. And we don't want to give away"
01:03:59;01:04:04;"too much because we really recommend people read the book and experience this information that way."
01:04:04;01:04:09;"But in the course of your research, you became very familiar with this idea or with this project,"
01:04:09;01:04:15;"MKUltra. And I've just noticed more and more people referencing it. You see more and more"
01:04:15;01:04:20;"people using the phrase PSYOP all the time these days, which it's funny. You actually, I learned"
01:04:20;01:04:25;"this from your book. You talk about the fact that brainwash, that phrase didn't exist in the English"
01:04:25;01:04:30;"language until the Korean war. Right. And you say that it actually comes from a Chinese phrase."
01:04:30;01:04:36;"Yeah. Well, they were the first ones that were actually experimenting with it during the Korean"
01:04:36;01:04:42;"war and previously, and they invented, I don't know if they invented the word for it, or I don't"
01:04:42;01:04:49;"know enough about Chinese language. But yeah, it came from them. So basically there's one part of"
01:04:49;01:04:56;"the book that we don't have to go too into detail about, but it's the story of Jimmy Shaver. Can you"
01:04:56;01:05:01;"just summarize what MKUltra was and maybe tell like the real quick version of the Jimmy Shaver story?"
01:05:01;01:05:09;"Yeah. Well, the ultimate objective of MKUltra was to create programmed assassins, people who could"
01:05:09;01:05:14;"be either using drugs or hypnotism, sensory deprivation, whatever. The CIA was trying to"
01:05:14;01:05:20;"figure out how they could take control of people's minds and get them to do acts that were against"
01:05:20;01:05:27;"their moral code, including all kinds of things, but most importantly, to kill somebody without any"
01:05:27;01:05:33;"recollection of being programmed to do it. And oftentimes they hoped that they could create it"
01:05:33;01:05:38;"so that they wouldn't remember having done it after they'd done it. And, you know, there was"
01:05:38;01:05:43;"a famous book from the late 50s called the Manchurian Candidate, which later became a movie"
01:05:43;01:05:49;"in the early 60s and then was remade, I think like 10 years ago, which is based on, I mean,"
01:05:49;01:05:53;"that guy that I can't, what's the name of the guy? I forget the name of the author who wrote the"
01:05:53;01:05:57;"first book, but I'm convinced and a lot of people are convinced he was actually part of the program"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"and it was kind of, he was putting out a little information there. I don't think with the agency's"
01:06:01;01:06:07;"knowledge. So Jimmy Shaver was convicted of killing a three-year-old girl, two and a half-year-old"
01:06:07;01:06:17;"girl named Sherry Horton. And he was found in a gravel pit in Texas in 1953, wandering around"
01:06:17;01:06:22;"dazed with his shirt was off and there were scratches on him. This little girl had been"
01:06:22;01:06:28;"missing for about three or four hours. There had been a search party. He was taken into custody and"
01:06:28;01:06:33;"they found the little girl's body. And he admitted that he probably killed her, but he had no"
01:06:33;01:06:39;"recollection of doing it. He didn't know how he got to where he was. It was a sensational story"
01:06:39;01:06:45;"in the state of Texas. It didn't really have national coverage. But what I found out was that"
01:06:45;01:06:53;"Jimmy Shaver was, well, he was an airman at Lackland Air Force Base in 1953 and 54 when this"
01:06:53;01:07:01;"happened. And Jolly West, who was a central figure in my book, was the psychiatrist who examined him"
01:07:01;01:07:07;"for the trial and extracted a confession from him and was able to make him remember killing"
01:07:07;01:07:15;"this little girl. I present a case in my book that this was all part of the experiments Jolly"
01:07:15;01:07:22;"West was conducting at Lackland Air Force Base at the time to try to get people to go and commit"
01:07:22;01:07:27;"acts against their moral codes. I don't think he had ever wanted to program Shaver to commit this"
01:07:27;01:07:33;"murder. I think it was something that went wrong. But I had found letters, and it's a big section"
01:07:33;01:07:40;"of I think chapter 11 of the book, showing that this Jolly West had been a part of the MKUltra"
01:07:40;01:07:47;"program starting in 1952, 53, was at Lackland Air Force Base experimenting on airmen to achieve just"
01:07:47;01:07:53;"this kind of thing, the erasure of memory, the implantation of false memories. And I think that"
01:07:53;01:07:59;"Jimmy Shaver was an MKUltra experiment gone very wrong. And I think if your listeners read the book,"
01:07:59;01:08:03;"they'll get a clearer picture of what I'm trying to say here, because it's hard. But yesterday,"
01:08:03;01:08:10;"I did a podcast with the niece of a little girl who was killed. So Sherry Jo, yeah, so Sherry Jo"
01:08:10;01:08:19;"was turning three when she was murdered in 1954. And her older brother was with her when she was"
01:08:19;01:08:26;"abducted. And he was about seven. He died a few years ago, but his daughter and her husband have"
01:08:26;01:08:32;"a podcast. And they reached out to me and said, ""We want you to come on our podcast and talk about"
01:08:32;01:08:37;"the death of my aunt, Sherry."" It's actually how they pronounce it. I didn't know that."
01:08:37;01:08:42;"And I was a little worried about it because, you know, it's such a sensitive subject,"
01:08:42;01:08:48;"and it impacted their lives. But they're convinced that I was, you know, that the evidence I present"
01:08:48;01:08:53;"shows that everything they thought about the death of this little girl for her family for 60,"
01:08:53;01:08:59;"70 years was wrong and was part of a cover-up by the government. And they want to pursue it now."
01:08:59;01:09:05;"And that's gratifying to me in the end. And I was actually happy to honor the girl's memory by"
01:09:05;01:09:10;"talking to her family. So it went pretty well. I think it's going to go up in a few days. But"
01:09:10;01:09:16;"that's an important story, I think, in my book. I don't get asked about it a lot. It's a horrible"
01:09:16;01:09:20;"story. I mean, in the end, it's difficult to read when you see what happened to her."
01:09:20;01:09:20;"Right."
01:09:20;01:09:25;"But it's fascinating and I think really kind of important in the timeline"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"of the evolution of MKUltra and what they were doing."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Right. Well, thanks so much, Tom. It's been great talking to you."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"And thanks for having me."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Encourage everybody to read Chaos, book of the year."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"Thank you. Thank you."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Have a good one, man."
01:09:39;01:09:42;"All right, guys. I enjoyed it. All right. Bye-bye."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"Bye."
01:10:13;01:10:18;"Well, Tom O'Neill, what a legend. I like that he's just such a nice guy, too."
01:10:18;01:10:24;"You know, I'm also glad to hear that there's a script being worked on where he's the protagonist."
01:10:24;01:10:24;"Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"I think for both of us, that was like a really appealing side of it. In fact,"
01:10:27;01:10:31;"when you first told me about it, I think you specifically said he's this dude. He's like"
01:10:31;01:10:37;"taking these like random old cops to Denny's to try to get information about them. And there's"
01:10:37;01:10:43;"a part of that that's just as appealing as what he uncovers about the deception and the"
01:10:43;01:10:47;"connections between local law enforcement and the CIA and Charles Manson. That stuff's"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"cool. Very fascinating. But also just like he's the perfect person to take you on this journey."
01:10:52;01:10:59;"Oh, absolutely. And of course, I feel like we got fresh research done on this interview."
01:10:59;01:11:06;"David Fincher's parents were friends with Charles Manson's parole officer. That is a big get."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"Yeah, I'm going to do some original research because that's pretty wild because I didn't"
01:11:09;01:11:14;"want to bore him with too much like Zodiac stuff. But this morning when I knew we were having him on"
01:11:14;01:11:19;"the show, I actually sat down with like a pad and paper. I wrote a little like timeline out just so"
01:11:19;01:11:25;"I'd know what I was talking about. That's like where I was like, August 1st, 1969 Zodiac Killer"
01:11:25;01:11:31;"sent because basically, in that time period, the Zodiac Killer sends his letter to the San Francisco"
01:11:31;01:11:36;"Chronicle. They publish his cipher. A week later, the Manson murders happen. A week after that,"
01:11:36;01:11:42;"the Zodiac Killer strikes again in the city of San Francisco. Then he kills again in like"
01:11:42;01:11:48;"September and October. They finally get Charles Manson December 1969. Just imagine that whole"
01:11:48;01:11:53;"time period after the Tate murders. There are these murders going on up north by the Zodiac"
01:11:53;01:11:58;"Kill. All this stuff happening together is crazy. And we talked about when Death Spot was on the"
01:11:58;01:12:04;"show and I was actually texting Alec because he talked about this, that there's always been a"
01:12:04;01:12:10;"theory that Ted Kaczynski could have been the Zodiac Killer. And I don't know if that's true."
01:12:10;01:12:14;"But one thing is true is that a lot of people think that Ted Kaczynski was at least partially"
01:12:14;01:12:20;"a product of MKUltra. I don't know if there's hard documentation that he is part of MKUltra."
01:12:20;01:12:24;"He definitely was part of psychological experiments when he was an undergrad at Harvard"
01:12:24;01:12:31;"that some people thought like went too far. That's for sure. Whether there was a CIA link to those"
01:12:31;01:12:38;"projects or those experiments, who's to say. But it is weird as hell just to imagine that in the"
01:12:38;01:12:44;"summer of '69, which was a very positive summer for Bryan Adams, but not for many people. In the"
01:12:44;01:12:51;"summer of '69, you had the Manson murders, the Zodiac Killer, and Ted Kaczynski being a professor"
01:12:51;01:12:57;"at Berkeley all there. CIA has a secret office in San Francisco. So does the FBI. Got the Black"
01:12:57;01:13:03;"Panthers, Ronald Reagan, California summer of '69. That is some crazy s***."
01:13:03;01:13:11;"- Hetty Brew. I think we should do a rewrite of summer of '69."
01:13:11;01:13:17;"- I worked for MKUltra. I dosed Charles Manson."
01:13:17;01:13:25;"- Just a song that has the same vibe as the film Zodiac or Tom's book."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"- Wait, what if we take 20 years to write the song?"
01:13:28;01:13:36;"It's like, you know, we both had music projects, JK Moundries, I had Vampire Weekend. You know,"
01:13:36;01:13:41;"we started the song as a lark. We figured we could probably get it done in a couple of weeks,"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"maybe play it on the show. Next thing you know, we actually stopped doing the show."
01:13:44;01:13:50;"Research for the song became a passion of ours and it took us 20 years. We're both deeply in debt,"
01:13:51;01:13:57;"but now it's 2040 and we'd like to present to you our, the song is four hours long"
01:13:57;01:14:03;"and it's called Summer of '69. - Crickets."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"- Also, just the last thing I'll say, there's a line somewhere in Dark Star,"
01:14:07;01:14:15;"that Jerry Garcia book I keep referencing, where somebody's talking about how many great musicians"
01:14:15;01:14:22;"just happened to be growing up in, you know, the Bay Area, Palo Alto area, SF area in that time."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"You know, obviously a lot of people moved to SF once it became known as like the hippie town,"
01:14:26;01:14:30;"but even before then, just a lot of people just happened to be there. There's a quote from"
01:14:30;01:14:36;"somebody who's like, oh, and by the way, Robert Hunter, he did acid experiments. He was part of"
01:14:36;01:14:41;"MKUltra. So there is something crazy to imagine that like, that weirdly there are connections"
01:14:41;01:14:47;"between the CIA, the Grateful Dead, Charles Manson, Ted Kaczynski, the JFK assassination,"
01:14:47;01:14:51;"all this, but there's a line somewhere in Dark Star where somebody says something about,"
01:14:51;01:14:56;"you know, the fact that all these interesting people came together who created cultural products"
01:14:56;01:15:00;"that changed the world, or at least changed America. And somebody says, I don't know, man,"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"there must've just been something in the air. - Something in the water."
01:15:03;01:15:08;"- Something in the water. And somebody even says, well, you know, Stanford Research Institute was"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"around there. And that's this famous research institute that worked on everything from, I think,"
01:15:12;01:15:19;"like atomic bombs to marketing. But you know, a lot of secretive was happening there. And somebody"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"said, I don't know, man, like somebody, they made some joke about maybe Stanford Research Institute"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"was like pumping some chemicals up into the air out there in Palo Alto, because there was something"
01:15:28;01:15:32;"happening there, man, in the 60s and that era. And it really made me think like, I don't know,"
01:15:32;01:15:38;"maybe there was. Like, wouldn't that be crazy if like there's some weird by-product of CIA"
01:15:38;01:15:45;"experiments, like made everybody in like the peninsula, like lightly dosed, like a young Steve"
01:15:45;01:15:53;"Jobs, Robert Hunter, Jerry Garcia. There is something about the Bay Area being the center of"
01:15:53;01:16:00;"culture, tech, and apparently secret intelligence operations. Talk about a heady brew."
01:16:00;01:16:05;"- You know what's crazy thing about like, if just by chance, if like Jerry Garcia,"
01:16:05;01:16:10;"Charles Manson and Steve Jobs were all sitting in the same like Indian restaurant in like the"
01:16:10;01:16:15;"hate in like 1968, and they obviously didn't know who each other were or may have to find"
01:16:15;01:16:18;"who Garcia was, but like. - No, first of all, I don't know how,"
01:16:18;01:16:23;"Steve Jobs, he would have been like a teenager or something. Garcia and Manson, there's no way those"
01:16:23;01:16:27;"dudes did not like walk past each other on the street at least once. - For sure."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"- Hate Esprit is not a big neighborhood. - No."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"- The central area, there's no way that Manson and Garcia probably weren't even at the same party at"
01:16:33;01:16:38;"some point. That absolutely happened. - They were probably shopping in the gap at"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"the same time, right? - I think the gap opened August '69."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"- Are you serious? - How crazy is that? In SF?"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"- Definitely not in the hate, I was just joking about like."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- I know it's 1969, what months did the gap open?"
01:16:48;01:16:53;"- Now, now, now, now, now, let's get a number crunch."
01:16:53;01:16:58;"- Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000. - The gap opened its first store,"
01:16:58;01:17:02;"August 21st, 1969. - Oh my God."
01:17:02;01:17:10;"- Whoa. Ezra, if we had a time machine, I swear to God, you and I, like Bill and Ted style,"
01:17:10;01:17:16;"we would have to go back to San Francisco on August 1st, 1969."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"- Well, we'd wanna go earlier, we wanna go like '68."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"- '68. - We'd wanna rip down to LA maybe."
01:17:20;01:17:23;"- Yes. - That's actually an interesting question."
01:17:23;01:17:28;"You're not talking about like going back like thousands of years, but you know, people always"
01:17:28;01:17:33;"talk about like, would you stop Hitler? Well, you know, Hitler and the wars he caused that killed"
01:17:33;01:17:37;"millions and millions of people. Most people would say, well, that's a lot of lives to save."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"But then you get into some weird, it's like, what if you could go back in time and stop the"
01:17:40;01:17:46;"Manson murders? Like morally, you'd save the lives of four people, a pregnant woman, you know,"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"of course, but then you really do get into some weird butterfly effect."
01:17:50;01:17:54;"You know what, I would do it. Even if that meant that like, all you guys had never been born,"
01:17:54;01:17:59;"I'd really hate to see you go, but I would go back in time. Then I'd come back. I'd be so curious to"
01:17:59;01:18:04;"see how different the world might be if the Manson murders never happened. That'd be crazy. It would"
01:18:04;01:18:09;"definitely suck if I'm like, yo, Jake, I just got back. And it's like, this number doesn't exist."
01:18:09;01:18:13;"I'm like, what the (beep) And I'm like, looking up the long stretch, like somehow you didn't get"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"born because I stopped the Manson murders. That's a Twilight Zone episode."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"- Dude. - That's a black mirror."
01:18:19;01:18:24;"- I like this idea of us doing like a Bill and Ted. Like we could go back to '68 and find"
01:18:24;01:18:31;"Manson in the heat and just follow him and see if he like met Jolly West. See if like,"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"just like be a fly in the wall and just track Manson."
01:18:34;01:18:39;"- Oh, yo, that's good. Or we're just like, if we don't change history, we lay real low,"
01:18:39;01:18:43;"but we have like one iPhone with us and we're just like filming all this (beep)"
01:18:43;01:18:47;"Oh, and like, maybe like the charger breaks at some point and we have to go find like young"
01:18:47;01:18:52;"Steve Jobs and we're like, bro, can you figure out? And he's like, what the (beep) is this (beep)"
01:18:52;01:18:58;"We have like one iPhone with us and we go down and we're like filming it and we kind of film"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"all of it and we're just like, got it. And then we come back in time and we show people all this"
01:19:02;01:19:07;"footage and we're just like pariahs. People are like, you filmed the murders and you didn't stop"
01:19:07;01:19:12;"it? We're like, well, if we stopped it, all this crazy (beep) like we all might, you might not even"
01:19:12;01:19:16;"be alive. People are like, you guys are despicable. And we're like, call Tom and we're like, Tom,"
01:19:16;01:19:23;"we got the footage, man. Yeah, the CIA dosed Manson. We figured it out. And everybody just"
01:19:23;01:19:28;"(beep) hates us. It's kind of lose, lose in a sense, but I like the idea for a murder."
01:19:28;01:19:33;"I don't want to film the murders. I want to just go to a year before the murders and"
01:19:33;01:19:38;"follow Manson for like a week. Yeah. Like we follow his parole officer and we go to,"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"we kind of, yeah, solve some of this (beep) Yeah. If we stopped the murders."
01:19:41;01:19:44;"And then also catch a dead show while we're that, you know, back there."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"We see the dead at the film."
01:20:27;01:20:33;"Well, it was a very heady time, San Francisco in the late sixties, but there's another town"
01:20:33;01:20:40;"in America. That's also full of mystery, a place that's just teeming with conspiracy theories."
01:20:40;01:20:46;"And that's Hershey, Pennsylvania. We haven't talked about it in a minute, but similar to Tom"
01:20:46;01:20:53;"O'Neill and his dogged research, we doggedly pursued this story about whether or not Hershey's"
01:20:53;01:21:01;"changes the formula for Reese's peanut butter cups between the winter and the summer. We've"
01:21:01;01:21:05;"gotten a lot of people writing in, we've got some interesting leads. We've had some, you know,"
01:21:05;01:21:10;"heartbreaking failures as we've tried to crack the case. But finally we have somebody directly"
01:21:10;01:21:16;"from the Hershey company, their director of social strategy and content and the creator of C-suite,"
01:21:16;01:21:20;"Hershey's in-house agency, Ryan Reese. So maybe we can finally get some answers."
01:21:20;01:21:24;"Now let's go to the time crisis hotline."
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Hello."
01:21:29;01:21:29;"Is that Ryan?"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Yeah. How are you guys?"
01:21:31;01:21:36;"Oh, not bad. Thanks for calling. Where are we talking to you from? Is it Hershey PA?"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Hershey PA, sweetest place on earth."
01:21:38;01:21:42;"Okay. That rules. I wondered if you'd be like, you could kind of picture sometimes"
01:21:42;01:21:48;"with these big companies, they might spin off their agency somewhere else. You're just like,"
01:21:48;01:21:53;"yeah, I'm in downtown Chicago right now. I'm talking to you from the 80th floor of the"
01:21:54;01:22:00;"building. Okay. So you're in Hershey PA. That's where your office is. Are you from Pennsylvania?"
01:22:00;01:22:06;"No, I grew up in Florida. Basically after I got my MBA, I came to Hershey because of the"
01:22:06;01:22:12;"Hershey company. Like it wasn't like I had any like friends, relatives, anyone. So when my wife"
01:22:12;01:22:19;"and I moved here, I got married a week before my internship. And like when I picked my wife up from"
01:22:19;01:22:25;"like the airport, cause you know, I started like two weeks after the honeymoon, you know, she on"
01:22:25;01:22:31;"the way just started crying and was like, I don't know anyone here. I hate everything here. And I"
01:22:31;01:22:36;"was like, well, you've actually never been here. So it makes sense that you don't have any friends"
01:22:36;01:22:42;"here and that you don't know anyone. But now, you know, we've kind of fallen into the two kids"
01:22:42;01:22:46;"living the dream with no traffic lifestyle. That is Hershey, Pennsylvania."
01:22:46;01:22:51;"So what's the town of Hershey like? Are there any unusual things about it? Or"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"obviously there's a big chocolate factory, huh?"
01:22:55;01:23:00;"It's one of those things that I don't think my kids will ever realize necessarily that it's not"
01:23:00;01:23:05;"normal. You know what I'm saying? Cause this is their normal, but like, like when you're driving"
01:23:05;01:23:13;"in downtown Hershey, which, you know, is like a block and a half, you know, in a one story buildings,"
01:23:13;01:23:19;"the streetlights are Hershey kisses. And then, you know, you're driving by and, you know,"
01:23:19;01:23:24;"you have a big chocolate factory and it'll smell like chocolate or smell like Reese's."
01:23:24;01:23:29;"It smells more to me like Reese's when they're roasting the peanuts. And it's like, these things"
01:23:29;01:23:34;"are not like normal, but like, if you only have grown up there, you think it's kind of normal."
01:23:34;01:23:39;"And then there's the giant Hershey park, right? Which is like big, you know,"
01:23:39;01:23:44;"park. Yeah. It's a big amusement park. So we would have season passes and, you know,"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"if you have a season pass, like after work, Hey kids, do you want to go to Hershey park?"
01:23:49;01:23:54;"You know, it's like, yeah, let's just go for a couple hours. So they grew up like going to like"
01:23:54;01:23:59;"Hershey park and like smelling roasted peanuts driving on street with Hershey kiss lights."
01:23:59;01:24:03;"Whoa. And then to them, that's like nothing, right? This is like, yeah, yeah, that's totally normal."
01:24:03;01:24:07;"So I guess one of my first questions is, so you're talking about the smell when they're"
01:24:07;01:24:12;"roasting the peanuts. Does that vary when they switch to the winter formula from the summer"
01:24:12;01:24:18;"formula? Oh God. I heard, I, okay. This, yeah, this is like, I was just waiting for this. I was"
01:24:18;01:24:25;"like, what? I wanted to know the theory behind this. Cause you guys all seem like bright guys."
01:24:25;01:24:32;"You know, I read, you know, a couple of like your CVs. I actually am curious as to the Genesis,"
01:24:32;01:24:36;"the Epic of Gilgamesh part of the story of how this came about, this theory."
01:24:36;01:24:40;"So you read our CVs. We know a little bit about you. You said you have an MBA,"
01:24:40;01:24:45;"but you're the director of social strategy and content at Hershey. So you're, you're kind of"
01:24:45;01:24:50;"like a spokesperson. You're all about projecting the image of the brand, right? That's your job."
01:24:50;01:24:55;"Definitely not. No, that is definitely not my job. What I do is, well, I guess, I don't know."
01:24:55;01:24:59;"It depends on how you're defining it, but like, yeah, I'm in charge of the creative,"
01:24:59;01:25:04;"right? So in terms of a lot of advertising, yeah. So all the posts that you'll see like Facebook,"
01:25:04;01:25:10;"Instagram, Pinterest, for the majority of the brands, like, um, C-Suite Studio is our internal"
01:25:10;01:25:15;"agency. And that's kind of the, you know, we started that about two years ago, you know,"
01:25:15;01:25:21;"because obviously the need for content is higher than it's ever been. And so, yeah, that's kind of"
01:25:21;01:25:26;"what my team does. I respect all that, but I just want to understand something on a day-to-day"
01:25:26;01:25:32;"in terms of operations, how often are you interacting with the chemists who are specifically"
01:25:32;01:25:40;"work on Reese's? Not often, but throughout my 11 years, I have worked with them on various occasions,"
01:25:40;01:25:48;"tested it, right. Tasted it right from the line, tasted it, you know, in a jar. I once asked them"
01:25:48;01:25:53;"just on the side to make me a jar of it just because it's like just the center of the cup,"
01:25:53;01:25:57;"just like that. And they did it. It was great. What time of year was that?"
01:25:59;01:26:05;"I know. No, no, no. You gave us some background. So I'll give you some background on Jake. You"
01:26:05;01:26:12;"said you checked out our CVs. I believe Jake and I both have BAs. Jake, you have an advanced degree."
01:26:12;01:26:16;"Yeah, I do. I have an MFA. Yeah. I have a very strong CV."
01:26:16;01:26:22;"Oh, no, I was thoroughly impressed. So the way that we first got, you know, we got tipped off"
01:26:22;01:26:27;"on this from a friend of mine I grew up with. And basically he used to work at a bike shop in"
01:26:27;01:26:34;"Brooklyn and he would run errands for his boss. And his boss was a lover, like many of us,"
01:26:34;01:26:39;"of Reese's peanut butter cups. And he'd often send them to the corner store to go grab one."
01:26:39;01:26:43;"And he would give it to his boss. And sometimes the boss would eat one and say, you know,"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"you can have the rest. And it would always confuse my friend. He'd say, well, why?"
01:26:46;01:26:51;"You're such a Reese's nut. And he'd say, because that one's the winter formula. I only like the"
01:26:51;01:26:57;"summer formula. And this guy had a very advanced palate. He's a successful businessman. He owned a"
01:26:57;01:27:04;"bike shop in Brooklyn. So it's fair to say that this guy knew what was up and he had a very"
01:27:04;01:27:08;"advanced palate. He could tell when it was one or the other. And sometimes he'd get and say,"
01:27:08;01:27:12;"that's great. And we got some emails from other people who said, yes, this is true."
01:27:12;01:27:18;"People also with advanced palates. Yeah. And we look, we've had internal debate on the show about"
01:27:18;01:27:25;"whether or not it's true. We had somebody who noticed like the number of grams of potassium"
01:27:25;01:27:30;"was different between different Reese's that they'd collected over the years."
01:27:30;01:27:36;"I don't know if that's part of it, but yeah, we've just been trying to get some verification."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"Yeah. You're looking for answers. No, I can respect that. I mean,"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"thank you."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"This is kind of an investigative report and I appreciate that. That shows the passion and"
01:27:44;01:27:48;"love for our brand. And I, you know, nothing but respect from my side."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Thank you."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"The winter formula."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Okay."
01:27:52;01:27:57;"Just to get down to it, it's quite similar to the summer formula. Some would even say it"
01:27:57;01:28:03;"is the exact summer formula. Some, you know, I happen to be one of that some"
01:28:03;01:28:08;"that say it's the exact same formula, but I'm wondering what the, I'm just saying it could be,"
01:28:08;01:28:15;"you know, a lot of different factors, you know, but there's different ratios of peanut butter."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Was he always getting the same one? Because there's different ratios of peanut butter,"
01:28:18;01:28:22;"which obviously provide a different experience, you know?"
01:28:22;01:28:22;"Wait, what do you mean?"
01:28:22;01:28:26;"What do you mean?"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"I thought this was going to go. That's where I thought this was going, you know?"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"Wait, there's different ratios of peanut butter in the summer and the winter?"
01:28:33;01:28:40;"No, not, no, not true. But there are different ratios across the product line. You know,"
01:28:40;01:28:45;"like when you think about the various sizes, I looked at your CVs. I looked at my own. I don't"
01:28:45;01:28:50;"think any of us have advanced degrees in physics, but I think we can kind of understand that to get"
01:28:50;01:28:56;"that the shape of the peanut butter cup, you know, some of the small ones are, you know,"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Oh yeah, of course."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"Vertically oriented."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"Different amount of surface area. Yeah, yeah, sure."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"Yeah. So, you know, some of those will have less peanut butter to chocolate."
01:29:05;01:29:09;"Let's make it more general. Is it unprecedented in the history of the company"
01:29:09;01:29:16;"or in the sweets industry to, obviously, summer is the enemy of chocolate to some extent, right?"
01:29:16;01:29:21;"S'mores. I mean, people, it's a nice s'mores. It can kind of help the melting process already."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"He's dodging."
01:29:22;01:29:29;"I mean, it's, you know, no, these are tough questions. I was told this was a, you know,"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"a great group of guys had some, you know, pretty softball questions."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"I didn't realize that this was going to be so intense."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"No, this is hard hitting."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Yeah, no."
01:29:38;01:29:42;"Well, you got to understand that the guest we had on before you was this guy, Tom O'Neill,"
01:29:42;01:29:47;"who wrote this great book. He spent 20 years investigating the Manson murders,"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"and he uncovered all sorts of stuff that nobody had before."
01:29:50;01:29:50;"Yeah."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"So we're a little bit fired up after that, but."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"Yeah."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"So the official line is that the formula stays the same."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"That is correct. The formula does stay the same."
01:29:58;01:30:03;"G's up, rev them V's up, federally trying to reach us to keep us"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Flooded pieces, diamond sized pieces, pieces"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"You know who he is, look and talk show like Regis"
01:30:08;01:30:12;"King push flow prestigious, hustle off me like leeches"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"X and O's, tic-tac-toe, up 'em, duck 'em, let them go"
01:30:15;01:30:19;"On to the next, knock us in the decks of them Cali Lolos"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"Houston, candy paint, screwed up vocals"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"New York, Range Road, sit on momos"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"Fishing in that Bentley, GT, oh no"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Float chameleon, worth by the million"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Sell Bolivian, feds in oblivion"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Zooty Zillion, purse reptilian"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Took 'em from off, off island like Dillon"
01:30:34;01:30:37;"I want to ask you a Tom O'Neill style question. Okay."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"So maybe we're wrong about it."
01:30:38;01:30:46;"Can you tell us anything that people don't know about Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Anything that you think has been left out of the official narrative?"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"It could be off the record."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"It could be off the record."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"[Laughter]"
01:30:56;01:30:57;"No, sorry, actually it can't be."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"It's just that's not the nature of it."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"[Laughter]"
01:31:01;01:31:07;"Like, I know, this is like, I think it's all very much on the up and up."
01:31:07;01:31:13;"But I do think, on a serious note, that it's one of those things that because"
01:31:13;01:31:19;"people love it so much, and right, and there's like so many different forms,"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"and there's so many different ways that you're getting it like"
01:31:22;01:31:29;"from the plant, through the system, to the retailer, there's like, it's changing hand that"
01:31:29;01:31:34;"I'm sure there is absolutely different tastes when you will get it, right?"
01:31:34;01:31:38;"You know, like if it was like, sometimes if you cycle through heat, you know,"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"then it's not good, right?"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"You don't want to like, if the store decides that like, hey, our bills are too much,"
01:31:44;01:31:48;"and we're going to turn off the air conditioning in the summer,"
01:31:48;01:31:51;"and it gets cold, and then add, you know, that's not really right."
01:31:51;01:31:54;"Because, you know, peanuts and the oils is going to the surface."
01:31:54;01:31:59;"So there, I'm sure there's a lot of variation, like, not a lot of variation,"
01:31:59;01:32:02;"but I'm sure there is variation for those people that like,"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"love peanut butter cups and eat them all the time."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"You know, but yeah,"
01:32:06;01:32:09;"I hope you like a skunked Reese's cup."
01:32:09;01:32:12;"You know, when you leave beer out in the sun, it gets skunked."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"I'm a teetotaler."
01:32:13;01:32:15;"So not really."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"I lost you."
01:32:16;01:32:16;"I lost you with this."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"15 years."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Yeah, no, I think that was a younger man."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"That is not the new man."
01:32:21;01:32:25;"But yeah, no, I think that's a fair point."
01:32:25;01:32:29;"Is that at some mom and pop corner store somewhere."
01:32:29;01:32:32;"Yeah, maybe it's sweltering New York City summer."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"It turned the AC off at night."
01:32:34;01:32:38;"By the time you're purchasing that peanut butter cup,"
01:32:38;01:32:44;"it may have melted a little bit, froze back up seven times or something."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"And it probably tastes weird."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"So I guess one question I have for you then is"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"working at the company and living in Hershey, PA,"
01:32:49;01:32:55;"is there like a company store or can you like literally roll down to the factory"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"and get one like before it even goes in the wrapper?"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Oh, yeah."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"When I was on the brand team,"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"like I've been on the brand team a couple of times."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"You always know if someone goes to the factory, any factory,"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"it's like, oh, bring stuff back."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"Right."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"And so Reese's, like it became this cool thing."
01:33:11;01:33:15;"So Reese's started doing fresh from the factory cups, you know,"
01:33:15;01:33:19;"so like where we just kind of bypass like all the traditional kind of sell direct,"
01:33:19;01:33:22;"even before like selling direct was like the thing, you know,"
01:33:22;01:33:27;"like now obviously a lot of companies like sell direct, but you can get it, you know,"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"and I've had cups like directly, like, I don't know,"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"that are like a week old, you know, something like that."
01:33:33;01:33:37;"And you, it's funny because they do, I don't know if it's like psychosomatic,"
01:33:37;01:33:42;"but like the notion of like, I drove to the factory, I smelled the roasted peanuts."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Now I'm eating it like in my car."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"I can't even make it back to the office."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"It is like, it is a special experience."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"I mean, it's awesome."
01:33:51;01:33:55;"A fresh cup's got to taste different than a week old."
01:33:55;01:33:55;"Essentially."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I mean, you guys are obviously aficionados."
01:33:57;01:34:02;"Like I will get some fresh from the factory, send them your way"
01:34:02;01:34:07;"so that you guys can do your own kind of experimentation as to."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Oh, so I got a question for you."
01:34:09;01:34:14;"So we're, this might be like, not the type of thing you're dealing with in the course of your job too often,"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"but just maybe you have a sense of it."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"So that'd be amazing."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Thank you for the offer."
01:34:19;01:34:23;"If you send us some Reese's fresh from the factory, we're all here in LA."
01:34:23;01:34:28;"By the time it got to us, you know, let's say we get it within 48 hours or something."
01:34:28;01:34:36;"Let's say I walk to like a 7-Eleven somewhere in LA and I buy a Reese's peanut butter cup."
01:34:36;01:34:42;"Do you have a sense of how long it took to get from the factory to me at the 7-Eleven?"
01:34:42;01:34:47;"I'm kind of always amazed by how fast it is, but I think with like modern transportation,"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"I mean, it's days and weeks."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"I mean, it's not like months, right?"
01:34:51;01:34:56;"It's a pretty like fast, like situation, but it would be weeks,"
01:34:56;01:35:00;"you know, and the product stays fresh for a very, very long time."
01:35:00;01:35:05;"So, no, but even then weeks versus two days is dramatic."
01:35:05;01:35:09;"In fact, that's what I'll do when we receive the fresh from the factory ones."
01:35:09;01:35:14;"I will walk down to a 7-Eleven, grab some and taste it."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Maybe it'll be a dramatic difference and suddenly they'll say,"
01:35:16;01:35:21;"""Oh, well, if I tasted these two things back to back, I might think they had different formulas."""
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Yeah, no, definitely."
01:35:22;01:35:27;"The other thing that's funny is like, we always, like whenever we're doing new innovation,"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"like as you can imagine, like we get to try like everything."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"It's like, ""Oh, we're trying this out."
01:35:32;01:35:32;"Like, do you like this?"
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Oh, we're trying this."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Do you like this?"""
01:35:34;01:35:37;"Right? So, like we try a lot of products before they ever come out."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"And it's like, ""Hey, what do you think about this formulation?"""
01:35:40;01:35:42;"I'm like a horrible taste tester."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"Like I have like the worst palate."
01:35:44;01:35:47;"Like I, you know, to the point where it's like, it's ridiculous."
01:35:47;01:35:53;"But we do have people that are like super tasters that go through the training"
01:35:53;01:35:59;"and then are able to like, you know, basically help the scientists say,"
01:35:59;01:36:00;"""Oh, this one's a little bit oaky."
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Can we take down this note?"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Oh, can we do this?"""
01:36:03;01:36:03;"Whoa."
01:36:03;01:36:08;"And then like, if there's ever a need to like change a formula or even,"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"not even a formula, but even like a supplier, you know, say,"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"""Oh, well, we want to start getting this person going out of business."
01:36:14;01:36:19;"We need to get a new manufacturer for this element of the formula."""
01:36:19;01:36:22;"Like they will just test it rigorously."
01:36:22;01:36:27;"And it's kind of amazing like that those people exist because I'm like the worst."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"If it was like a job requirement, I would not be a part of it."
01:36:30;01:36:35;"So you'll find out amongst yourselves, probably some of you will taste the difference."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Some of you might not taste any difference at all."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Interesting."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Well, thanks so much for taking time."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"I got one more question for you."
01:36:40;01:36:45;"Of course, like any red-blooded American, I'm familiar with Hershey's."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Love Hershey's peanut butter cups."
01:36:46;01:36:50;"And I'm sure, yeah, like almond Hershey's."
01:36:50;01:36:53;"Cause I got like, everybody got my faves, but also like a lot of people,"
01:36:53;01:36:58;"my memories of like the big products are so rooted in my own childhood."
01:36:58;01:37:03;"Cause the older you get, it's not that you don't stop eating candy, adults eat candy too,"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"but you just go for the stuff, you know,"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"you're probably not following all the new innovations and stuff."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"So I'm curious in recent history,"
01:37:09;01:37:16;"what are some of the Hershey companies like greatest hits of like, say the 2010s?"
01:37:16;01:37:16;"Yeah."
01:37:16;01:37:20;"So I'll give you like, there was two products that I helped develop,"
01:37:20;01:37:25;"which is kind of like, so I have a bias right toward them, but I'll,"
01:37:25;01:37:28;"I think they're wonderful and I, you know, you know,"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"you guys as Reese's lovers, hopefully we'll try them."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"So the transparency."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"Yeah, it is a little biased, admittedly."
01:37:35;01:37:35;"Okay."
01:37:35;01:37:42;"The first one was Reese's pieces cup, which, you know, basically I was on a train coming"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"back from New York."
01:37:43;01:37:47;"I got a call from one of our vice presidents and sales saying, Hey,"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"we really need a new innovation to kind of close out the year."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"Like they were worried about making their number for convenience."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"He's like, do you have anything?"
01:37:54;01:37:59;"And I said, like, no, but you know, this guy had always done well by me for my career."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"And, you know, you always want to like, take care of those people."
01:38:01;01:38:04;"So I said, let me just, I go, I'm literally on a train."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"I can at least give you the amount of time on the train to think about it."
01:38:07;01:38:13;"So when I was, I launched this product called the Hershey spread a while ago."
01:38:13;01:38:19;"And during that testing, they had once put Reese's pieces in the jar of peanut butter."
01:38:19;01:38:22;"And for whatever reason, just that little bit of texture"
01:38:22;01:38:26;"and the inside of a Reese's pieces is called panichi."
01:38:26;01:38:29;"It's kind of like a form of like peanut butter."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"I know it's very classy."
01:38:30;01:38:34;"Is that an Italian word or something that you guys made it up?"
01:38:34;01:38:34;"It's a word."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"It's a word."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"I don't know, but it is a word."
01:38:38;01:38:42;"And it's like a type of peanut buttery."
01:38:42;01:38:45;"Next time you're talking to somebody and you're saying like, well, I like Reese's"
01:38:45;01:38:49;"peanut butter cups because of the combination of the chocolate on the outside and the peanut"
01:38:49;01:38:55;"butter on the inside, would it be appropriate to say, hold on, dummy, I think you mean the"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"panichi on the inside."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"The panichi is only on the inside of Reese's pieces."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Inside the Reese's peanut butter cup is still the peanut butter."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"Oh, it's not the same thing."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"Oh, no, there are two different things."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"Two different formulas."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"One's a winter formula and one's a summer formula."
01:39:12;01:39:17;"Because obviously like Reese's pieces, those are great for the summer because they don't"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"melt, so I think that's when we use the summer formula, obviously."
01:39:20;01:39:26;"But so, yeah, so inside the Reese's cup is like the traditional peanut butter, but inside"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Reese's pieces is this panichi."
01:39:27;01:39:34;"And the combination of those two different peanut buttery flavors was amazing."
01:39:34;01:39:38;"And so I just said, hey, I don't know why we've never done this."
01:39:38;01:39:41;"What's the most Reese's thing we can do?"
01:39:41;01:39:44;"Let's just put Reese's pieces inside the peanut butter cup."
01:39:45;01:39:50;"And so I do know some of the scientists at the tech center, and I basically just called"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"them and said, hey, is this even possible?"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"And they said, I don't know why it wouldn't be."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"Let me just make some tonight."
01:39:56;01:40:02;"So basically, he just made like 10 of them and we tried them the next day and we're like,"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"damn, this is amazing."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"I mean, like you get that little bit of crunch and then it's like--"
01:40:06;01:40:10;"It's like smashed up Reese's pieces inside the peanut butter cup?"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"They're whole pieces."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"Oh, it's whole pieces."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"Yeah."
01:40:13;01:40:13;"Whoa."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"And it was also like super on brand, right?"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"It was literally like the brand on brand."
01:40:17;01:40:22;"It was like, what's the most kind of like fun Reese's thing you could do when you had"
01:40:22;01:40:25;"the like the equity colors inside the cup?"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"You never knew like what colors you were going to get."
01:40:28;01:40:32;"Like some were broken, some were like totally intact."
01:40:32;01:40:32;"It was just fun."
01:40:32;01:40:37;"And so to me, that was one of the ones that I thought was a really--"
01:40:37;01:40:44;"You're a Reese's lover to get both Reese's pieces and Reese's cups in the same bite was"
01:40:44;01:40:44;"cool."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Yeah, that's a good one."
01:40:46;01:40:52;"The other one was like the next year, they basically were like, OK, what's a new innovation?"
01:40:52;01:40:55;"And have you guys ever had Nutrageous?"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"To me, it's like the most underrated bar ever."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"It's like delicious."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"I feel like a Reese's person."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"It's the solid bar."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"Yeah."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Is it chocolate covered?"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Yeah."
01:41:04;01:41:07;"Is it a payday covered in chocolate?"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"Is that a fair--"
01:41:08;01:41:09;"That's a thing."
01:41:09;01:41:09;"Yeah."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"But it's different because it's, you know, payday has that thick caramel."
01:41:12;01:41:15;"This one has more peanut butter."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Oh, I don't know if I've ever had--"
01:41:16;01:41:17;"A softer caramel."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"It's delicious."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"It's like amazing."
01:41:19;01:41:26;"So we just said, hey, if people like the pieces cup, let's just replace all the nuts and put"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"Reese's pieces in that."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"And so we called it the Outrageous."
01:41:30;01:41:34;"And to me, I mean, it's indulgent, right?"
01:41:34;01:41:38;"I mean, it's like you got chocolate, caramel, the pieces."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"It's a pretty delicious eat."
01:41:41;01:41:45;"Spasm, waiter, drop into his DC."
01:41:45;01:41:50;"Slender on wrap, paper tie."
01:41:50;01:41:58;"Lifting up his hay, feels the sunlight in his eyes."
01:41:58;01:42:07;"Grasp the kettle top and shoot the breeze, please."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"Ramble while sloth scrapers sigh."
01:42:12;01:42:20;"Tossing in his bed at night, he'll dream until he dies."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Can I make one comment?"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"I don't think you should ever change the logo of Reese's."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"It's a great logo."
01:42:27;01:42:31;"And I feel like legacy brands feel the need to modernize."
01:42:31;01:42:37;"And I respect that it's still that nice kind of wax paper, orange."
01:42:37;01:42:41;"And I feel like the Hershey's logo also similar, very classy."
01:42:41;01:42:45;"Don't succumb to that pressure to modernize, please."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"Great. I agree with you."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"I agree with you."
01:42:48;01:42:48;"OK, cool."
01:42:48;01:42:51;"I agree with you both on all the front."
01:42:51;01:42:57;"I mean, we have an expression like you as what happens is like brand people see their"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"brand all day, every day."
01:42:58;01:43:02;"They get bored of it much faster than the consumer."
01:43:02;01:43:04;"And then you also want to get promoted."
01:43:04;01:43:04;"Right."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"So it's like, well, what did you do?"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"It's like I kept everything the same."
01:43:07;01:43:10;"Yeah, it's like kind of a weird way to get promoted."
01:43:10;01:43:14;"So I think sometimes marketers, whether they want to change like an ad campaign or they"
01:43:14;01:43:20;"want to change packaging, it's like to put their stamp on it when sometimes the smartest"
01:43:20;01:43:24;"thing is to respect the what the tradition is."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"And I feel like it's so classic."
01:43:26;01:43:30;"I feel like what's happened with Mountain Dew and Taco Bell logos in the last 20 years"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"is an absolute travesty."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"So that's my two cents."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Can I ask one question?"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah."
01:43:36;01:43:46;"If you were in charge of having Reese's do one sort of collaboration with another brand,"
01:43:46;01:43:51;"maybe a clothing brand, what would be like what would be the sort of perfect collab?"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Yeah."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"So for me, love the question."
01:43:54;01:43:57;"I also love what you said about the color palette."
01:43:57;01:44:02;"To me, I think a lot of these collabs go wrong in the sense that they want to like logo slap"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"everything."
01:44:03;01:44:06;"And to me, that's just not very exciting or original."
01:44:06;01:44:11;"I think with Reese's, you know, like when you think about like when people refer to"
01:44:11;01:44:16;"like the Oreo colorway, Oreo didn't need to even do anything for it to be like an Oreo"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"colorway."
01:44:17;01:44:23;"So to me, like when you see orange and yellow together and you throw in maybe even a little"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"bit of hint of brown, you're thinking Reese's."
01:44:25;01:44:31;"So to me, besides just like who I want to do the collab with, I'd want it to be like,"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"oh, is that a Reese's collab?"
01:44:33;01:44:38;"Like kind of like that, the subtlety versus the like, oh, let me throw my box logo right"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"next to your logo, you know, with an X."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"And so like, oh, look, we did a collab."
01:44:42;01:44:47;"I wanted to like have a little bit of that subtlety where you had the colorway and you're"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"just like, dude, is that a Reese's collab?"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"So I don't know."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"For me, like I kind of like high and low."
01:44:54;01:45:01;"So I think it'd be fun to do something with like Gucci or like Louis Vuitton or Yard,"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"the one that you can only buy in stores."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"But like I like high low."
01:45:04;01:45:11;"So I think that would be like really rad to have like a Reese's colorway kind of thing."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"It was like, hey, that Reese's."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"That's sick."
01:45:14;01:45:18;"Hey, Ryan, did you work on the Travis Scott Reese's cereal collaboration?"
01:45:18;01:45:18;"Was that?"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"No, like I wish I did."
01:45:20;01:45:23;"So Reese's, that was General Mills did that."
01:45:23;01:45:29;"And it was funny because like if you're not like I think someone sent us a box and we"
01:45:29;01:45:34;"have to approve everything and someone sent us something and they're like, hey, like you"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"like, which is sad, right?"
01:45:35;01:45:38;"Like that I might be the one that might be most knowledgeable of the coolest."
01:45:38;01:45:42;"But that's like that comes with the territory of like being in Central PA and Hershey PA"
01:45:42;01:45:48;"where it's like, hey, our best guess of like maybe someone knows what's going on is me."
01:45:48;01:45:52;"But, you know, like when those boxes came out, they're like, is this like this looks"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"like someone like a like a child drew this."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Is this like going to be OK?"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"You know, and we're like, oh, this is so rad."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"This is awesome."
01:45:59;01:46:05;"But that was a General Mills Reese's Puffs thing, which I thought was really cool and"
01:46:05;01:46:06;"really fun."
01:46:06;01:46:11;"But it's like I would love to do one that is even like more subtle, right?"
01:46:11;01:46:14;"That you don't really even necessarily know."
01:46:14;01:46:17;"I mean, to me, just because the color way is so strong."
01:46:17;01:46:20;"Maybe a pair of Crocs that are two different colors."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"Absolutely not."
01:46:22;01:46:22;"Where one is."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Absolutely not."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Hold on."
01:46:24;01:46:25;"It's or maybe it's like."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"That was unfair to me."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"That was unfair."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"It's a pair of Crocs."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"One's orange and one's brown."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"And Ryan, do you know what gibbets are?"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"No."
01:46:35;01:46:39;"You know how now people can put kind of flair on the holes of their Crocs?"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Yes."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"And then the gibbets are yellow."
01:46:42;01:46:48;"So between the two shoes, you get all three colors of Reese's pieces and you can move"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"the yellow gibbets around as you see fit."
01:46:50;01:46:50;"Yes."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"So you're a part of the collab."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"So it's you, Crocs and Reese's."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Honestly, you could just."
01:46:58;01:47:02;"You could just do Reese's gibbets and then you put them on just a pre-existing pair of"
01:47:02;01:47:02;"Crocs."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Yeah."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"I mean, I could really freshen up a pair, you know?"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Well, anyway, thanks so much."
01:47:06;01:47:06;"Please."
01:47:06;01:47:10;"We'd love to talk to you again, because I feel like actually the more we talk to you,"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"the more questions come up."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"I think we barely scratched the surface."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"So hopefully you'll come back."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"And thanks so much."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"Thanks, guys."
01:47:17;01:47:21;"I'll work to get you guys a care package."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"Terrific."
01:47:22;01:47:22;"Can't wait for that."
01:47:22;01:47:27;"And I'll tell you what, as soon as we get that care package, we'll absolutely drop"
01:47:27;01:47:31;"the investigation because it's gone on too long."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Too many lives have been ruined."
01:47:32;01:47:32;"I was going to say."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"That's a fair trade."
01:47:33;01:47:35;"Because I can talk to the plant."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"Which formula did you guys want for the care package?"
01:47:38;01:47:42;"Because even though it is, we're kind of in that transitional period right now."
01:47:42;01:47:42;"Right."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Fall."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"Where I can go either way."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"So I didn't know which one you guys wanted."
01:47:46;01:47:52;"I'd love to get a jumpstart on winter just so I can flex on the other people in the neighborhood."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"So like, just walk by."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Are you guys still eating that summer formula?"
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Ow."
01:47:56;01:47:57;"I agree."
01:47:57;01:47:57;"All right."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"Well, thanks so much, dude."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Thanks, guys."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Have a great night or day."
01:48:00;01:48:06;"You too."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Another great call."
01:48:35;01:48:39;"This has really been a fascinating investigative TC."
01:48:39;01:48:44;"Also, I don't know if we said it on the show, but Ryan Reese, his last name is spelled R-I-E-S-S."
01:48:44;01:48:49;"Just a weird coincidence that he works for the company that makes Reese's."
01:48:49;01:48:51;"R-E-E-S-E."
01:48:51;01:48:55;"Because we had two guests and we've enjoyed talking to them so much,"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"I don't think it makes sense to do a top five this one."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"I think we're a little short on time."
01:49:00;01:49:04;"And also, speaking of investigative journalism, there's something we wanted to get to."
01:49:04;01:49:08;"Because actually, Seinfeld, another thing, I would say over the past two weeks,"
01:49:08;01:49:14;"the top two things that I was getting tagged on, people texting me, all this stuff,"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"were LeBron wearing the Grateful Dead outfit,"
01:49:16;01:49:21;"and the other one was Travis Scott doing a collab with McDonald's."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"All I know is that something happened."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"I literally don't know what they did together."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"So Seinfeld, we got you on the case."
01:49:27;01:49:30;"We got you to Tom O'Neill this sh*t."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"What did you find out?"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"Let me start off by asking you a question, Ezra."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Yeah."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Do you have a go-to order for McDonald's?"
01:49:36;01:49:42;"I haven't gone to McDonald's in a long time, but I don't exactly have a go-to."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"But this comes up in conversation a lot, where people say,"
01:49:45;01:49:48;"""What was your favorite extra value meal?"""
01:49:48;01:49:52;"And for me, a long time, I was a Big Mac extra value meal guy."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"But eventually, I became a two cheeseburger guy."
01:49:56;01:49:59;"Because I just thought that was fun, that you got two cheeseburgers,"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"you unwrap one, then you unwrap the other."
01:50:02;01:50:06;"There was something about the ceremony, the presentation of it."
01:50:06;01:50:10;"It felt like you were getting more bang for your buck getting the two cheeseburger meal."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"So whatever, I'll stand by that."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"I'm a two cheeseburger extra value meal guy."
01:50:14;01:50:14;"You know what?"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"I feel you on that."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"I will still go to McDonald's from time to time."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"And I do get the two cheeseburger meal as well."
01:50:20;01:50:24;"And what I like about it is that the burgers are not too heavy either."
01:50:24;01:50:28;"And if you don't want to finish the second one, you don't really feel too guilty about it."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"But I digress."
01:50:29;01:50:35;"Travis Scott has a go-to, and he's had it since he was a child growing up in Houston."
01:50:35;01:50:40;"And his go-to is a quarter pounder with lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup,"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"mustard, cheese, and bacon."
01:50:42;01:50:47;"And then he gets medium fries, and he gets a side of barbecue dip."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"Okay, sorry."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"That was a lot to take in."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"So you got a quarter pounder and you add all this--"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Let's slow down."
01:50:52;01:50:57;"Wait, did it even occur to me that you could like customize anything at McDonald's?"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"I know you could ask for like, ""Yo, can I get some barbecue sauce?"""
01:51:00;01:51:01;"Whatever."
01:51:01;01:51:06;"But when you described the burger, you said it was a quarter pounder with ketchup."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Yeah, mustard, cheese."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"Are all those things just part of a quarter pounder?"
01:51:11;01:51:15;"So everything there is part of a quarter pounder except for bacon."
01:51:15;01:51:20;"So Travis likes to customize his quarter pounder by adding bacon."
01:51:20;01:51:23;"I think everything else is part of the regular quarter pounder."
01:51:23;01:51:23;"Whoa."
01:51:24;01:51:27;"So he was like seven years old."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Just like, his mom's like, ""What do you want?"""
01:51:29;01:51:32;"And he's like, ""I don't want a quarter pounder, but to add bacon."""
01:51:32;01:51:33;"Okay, no problem."
01:51:33;01:51:37;"I just felt like if you asked for that s*** at McDonald's, they'd just be like,"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"""The quarter pounder does not come with bacon."""
01:51:39;01:51:41;"""No, I'm asking you to add bacon."""
01:51:41;01:51:45;"""Sir, if you want the extra bacon burger, I can get you that."""
01:51:45;01:51:47;"""No, I want the quarter pounder with bacon."""
01:51:47;01:51:52;"""Sir, all of the bacon is in the walk-in freezer because breakfast ended three hours ago."""
01:51:53;01:51:55;"But now they do breakfast all day."
01:51:55;01:51:55;"You know what's funny?"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"I was just having a conversation with somebody about the fact that"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"it used to be such a big deal."
01:52:00;01:52:04;"Sorry to digress for a second, Seinfeld, but remember it used to be such a big deal"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"that breakfast ended at McDonald's at 10.30?"
01:52:07;01:52:07;"Yep."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"People would be so angry."
01:52:09;01:52:13;"People would be f***ing yelling, ""It's 10.32."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"Tell me you don't still have that s*** on deck."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Tell me you don't have it there."""
01:52:16;01:52:18;"The classic scene in ""Falling Down."""
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Oh, right."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"Yeah, the Michael Douglas film."
01:52:20;01:52:21;"Michael Douglas film."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Anyway, yeah."
01:52:22;01:52:27;"And then we were talking about that McDonald's knew they had this interesting obsession"
01:52:27;01:52:30;"in the culture with their breakfast menu."
01:52:30;01:52:33;"And then they made a big hoopla a few years ago."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"For all I know, it might've been like 10 years ago."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"I don't remember."
01:52:35;01:52:39;"They made this big hoopla about now they have breakfast all day."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"And it was this big deal like, remember, it used to roll up and it was 10.30."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"It was so dramatic."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Now you guys wanted this s***."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Now you can have it, right?"
01:52:48;01:52:48;"Does this sound familiar?"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"They did breakfast all day."
01:52:50;01:52:50;"Yes."
01:52:50;01:52:55;"And talking about it the other day, we were like, ""They f***ed up."""
01:52:55;01:53:00;"They had something very special that people coveted, that people talked about, that people"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"fought about."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"And they just threw it in the dumpster."
01:53:04;01:53:08;"And so I was thinking, ""All right, if I was McDonald's and let's say I was like the"
01:53:08;01:53:12;"Ryan Reese of McDonald's and my boss calls me and is like, 'We need something special,"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"man."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Breakfast sales are flagging."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"What do we do?'"""
01:53:15;01:53:16;"And this is my solution."
01:53:17;01:53:21;"Rather than say, ""Well, let's make it all day because then you'll have some people coming"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"in for lunch, some people still want breakfast, double the sales."""
01:53:24;01:53:25;"No, that's not how it works."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"This is what my thing would have been."
01:53:26;01:53:33;"I would have made a giant campaign, get Bruno Mars to write a song, make this giant hoopla"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"that we're going to do a f***ing huge announcement."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"And then we f***ing do this crazy media blitz."
01:53:38;01:53:44;"And the whole campaign is about that McDonald's breakfast is now served until 10.45."
01:53:44;01:53:49;"And we make all these songs about like, ""15 minutes!"""
01:53:49;01:53:56;"And we make the most expensive commercial in history where literally Jesus Christ comes"
01:53:56;01:53:57;"back to earth."
01:53:57;01:54:00;"The president, we get everybody."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Beyonce."
01:54:02;01:54:07;"And it's this huge announcement, a full, the council of the most important people throughout"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"history."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"And all they announce is that it's 15 minutes."
01:54:10;01:54:14;"And, you know, Seinfeld, you'll come up with like a catchy slogan or something about the"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"most important 15 minutes in history or some sh*t."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Like, I don't know, whatever."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"And Bruno Mars will do the song."
01:54:19;01:54:22;"And we just make this huge thing about that, this extra 15 minutes."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Now that's exciting."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"That's a cultural reset."
01:54:26;01:54:27;"You know what I mean?"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"Yeah, it's a movement."
01:54:28;01:54:32;"I'm picturing the commercial, a family piles into a minivan."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"Dad's like, ""We gotta go."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"We gotta go."""
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Mom's like, ""Hurry it up."
01:54:35;01:54:35;"Hurry it up."""
01:54:35;01:54:38;"Like, baby, like wearing like half a diaper, you know, like all that."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"The whole family gets in the minivan."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"They screech off."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"They're like running red lights."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"They get to McDonald's."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"It's like 1032."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"They're like so mad."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"They're like, ""Ugh."""
01:54:48;01:54:49;"The dad rolls up."
01:54:49;01:54:53;"He's like, ""You know, can I, I know it's two minutes late."""
01:54:53;01:54:56;"And then the person behind the counter is like, ""Don't worry about it."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"Now breakfast is served until 1045."""
01:54:58;01:55:01;"You know, and then it's the Bruno Mars kicks in."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"You know, this is still a work in progress pitch."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"On the way there, the wife is like, ""So help me God, Larry."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"You lost your job."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"You don't take care of your family."
01:55:11;01:55:15;"And I swear to God, if you don't get us there in time to give your family Egg McMuffins,"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"I will divorce you."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"I will take the kids."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"I will leave you."""
01:55:18;01:55:20;"And he's just like, ""Brrr."""
01:55:20;01:55:22;"It's like a full action movie."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"And then he screeches up and it's like, that's another campaign."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"That's like later."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"It's like very serious black and white talking heads."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"""What do 15 minutes mean to you?"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"15 minutes saved my marriage."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"15 minutes saved my life."
01:55:33;01:55:37;"15 minutes helped me win the game."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"15 minutes let me graduate high school."""
01:55:40;01:55:42;"And then at the end, it's like, you know, ""McDonald's,"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"what will you do with the new 15 minutes?"""
01:55:45;01:55:45;"- I love it."
01:55:45;01:55:48;"- It does beg the question though of like,"
01:55:48;01:55:54;"what kind of like family with children is serving their kids breakfast at 1030?"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Maybe it's a Saturday."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"- I think it's after church."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"I think it's Sunday."
01:55:57;01:55:57;"- Okay."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"- It's a post-church tradition."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"It's a wholesome Christian family."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"- True."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"I like that."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"- That could be another one for religious people."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"And this could be the one that has Jesus Christ in it,"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"is that preacher's going a little bit long with the sermon."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"- Oh, look at the watch."
01:56:12;01:56:16;"- And just like, dude, everybody in the pews is just like looking at their watch,"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"like tapping their foot, like pulling their collar."
01:56:18;01:56:19;"""Yikes."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Oh, come on, wrap it up."""
01:56:21;01:56:23;"And then he's just like, ""And furthermore."""
01:56:23;01:56:25;"And everybody's like, ""No."""
01:56:25;01:56:27;"And then one guy's like, ""F*** it, I'm going to hell."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"I don't care."""
01:56:28;01:56:30;"And he like jumps in his car and leaves."
01:56:30;01:56:31;"And then everybody's like freaking out."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"And then the priest looks at the camera and is like,"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"""What are they freaking out?"""
01:56:34;01:56:38;"""About McDonald's for his breakfast until 1045 now."""
01:56:38;01:56:43;"- Just to build on that too."
01:56:43;01:56:43;"- Yes."
01:56:43;01:56:47;"- I was going to suggest that in the rush to get to McDonald's,"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"the person behind..."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"You know what?"
01:56:49;01:56:50;"This is too dark, actually."
01:56:50;01:56:50;"I'm not going to say it."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- Oh, no."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"- Wow, too dark for TC."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- Oh, Lord."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Well, I was going to say, okay,"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"that the person in the rush to McDonald's hits somebody."
01:56:57;01:57:02;"And then when we do Ezra's like kind of somber, like alternate version,"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"it's like that person who got hit was just like,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"""If only the paramedics had been here 15 minutes sooner."""
01:57:08;01:57:09;"You know, like you do an alternate,"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"you like cut to that person, you follow their narrative."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Anyway."
01:57:13;01:57:13;"- Oh, yeah."
01:57:13;01:57:13;"- Wow."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"- No, no."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"But that's another type of ad,"
01:57:15;01:57:18;"like the really weird sanctimonious one"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"where it actually could have nothing to do with it."
01:57:20;01:57:23;"Where it's just like, ""What does 15 minutes mean to you?"""
01:57:23;01:57:27;"And a surgeon is like, ""Another 15 minutes, I could have saved that man's life."""
01:57:27;01:57:29;"""What does 15 minutes mean to you?"""
01:57:29;01:57:33;"""Another 15 minutes, I could have told grandma that I loved her."""
01:57:33;01:57:35;"""What does 15 minutes mean to you?"""
01:57:35;01:57:38;"It's like, what's his name?"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"Bill Buckner or some sh*t."
01:57:39;01:57:42;"""Another 15 minutes, we could have won the World Series."""
01:57:42;01:57:44;"""What does 15 minutes mean to you?"""
01:57:44;01:57:49;"And it's like, like in general, I could have saved 500 American lives."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"And then it's like, ""What does 15 minutes mean to you?"""
01:57:51;01:57:54;"And it's like at McDonald's, we know how much 15 minutes mean."
01:57:54;01:57:57;"(laughs)"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"It like never even shows the product."
01:57:59;01:58:03;"It's just like the black and white, and the arches come up."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"At McDonald's, we know that 15 minutes could change the world."
01:58:05;01:58:08;"(laughs)"
01:58:08;01:58:09;"That's the Super Bowl ad."
01:58:09;01:58:14;"But yeah, that's the really serious Super Bowl ad with everything."

01:58:55;01:58:57;"So as part of this collaboration,"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"Travis and McDonald's have like branded that meal."
01:59:01;01:59:04;"So for $6 until October 8th,"
01:59:04;01:59:07;"you can order the Travis Scott meal"
01:59:07;01:59:10;"and you can get the classic Travis Scott quarter pounder"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"with bacon, the medium fries with barbecue sauce"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"and the medium spray."
01:59:14;01:59:14;"- Sounds pretty good."
01:59:14;01:59:18;"- And this collaboration is actually the first time"
01:59:18;01:59:22;"that McDonald's has put a celebrity's name on a product"
01:59:22;01:59:27;"since 1992 with the McJordan burger after Michael Jordan."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"- Wow. - So this is a big deal."
01:59:28;01:59:32;"It's been 30 years since McDonald's has done a move like this"
01:59:32;01:59:33;"and who better to do it with"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"than the innovator himself, Travis Scott."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"But I would say the more interesting part"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"of this collaboration is actually the merchandise."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"- Oh yeah, there it is. - The Cactus Jack is--"
01:59:41;01:59:44;"- I was kind of waiting if you were gonna be like,"
01:59:44;01:59:44;"and that's it."
01:59:44;01:59:46;"- No, no, there's no-- - It's kind of"
01:59:46;01:59:47;"interestingly subtle."
01:59:47;01:59:51;"- No, it's way more, that's just the tip of the iceberg."
01:59:51;01:59:53;"That's just the loss leader."
01:59:53;01:59:56;"Travis Scott under his Cactus Jack brand"
01:59:56;02:00:00;"has created with McDonald's 59 pieces of merchandise."
02:00:00;02:00:01;"- Oh my God."
02:00:01;02:00:05;"- Everything from a plain T-shirt with the McDonald's logo"
02:00:05;02:00:08;"but instead of McDonald's, it says Cactus Jack"
02:00:08;02:00:11;"all the way to their most adventurous item"
02:00:11;02:00:14;"which is a chicken nugget body pillow for $90."
02:00:14;02:00:18;"That's a hyper-realistic large body pillow"
02:00:18;02:00:21;"that looks exactly like a chicken nugget"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"that you can sleep with at night."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"- See, this is kind of interesting."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"We've definitely reached this point"
02:00:25;02:00:29;"where the same way that American industry was destroyed"
02:00:29;02:00:31;"'cause we don't make anything anymore"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"and our factories have all been outsourced"
02:00:33;02:00:36;"and we're basically just a whole country of ideas people,"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"guilty as charged."
02:00:38;02:00:42;"On the one hand, two brands can come together"
02:00:42;02:00:42;"to make something."
02:00:42;02:00:45;"We were talking about how Chinatown Market, though,"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"you need this third party to bring Grateful Dead"
02:00:47;02:00:48;"and Crocs together."
02:00:48;02:00:51;"And surely McDonald's could just team up"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"with a body pillow company to make something"
02:00:53;02:00:57;"but it's not even like McDonald's and Travis Scott team up"
02:00:57;02:01:00;"for, I guess in the past it would have been"
02:01:00;02:01:05;"a rap song about McDonald's or a McDonald's product"
02:01:05;02:01:09;"like a Big Mac box with Travis Scott on it."
02:01:09;02:01:10;"Things that are just direct."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"Now there's this weird third party stuff"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"that's just like Travis Scott, like you said,"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"he's a huge innovator."
02:01:16;02:01:19;"He was brought in not just as a celebrity"
02:01:19;02:01:23;"but as like a Ryan Reese, like a strategy guy."
02:01:23;02:01:27;"And Travis Scott said, ""Well, I'm happy to brand a meal"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"with my name but I also just wanna help you"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"create products that are meaningful to people"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"and I'm gonna help you make"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"a Chicken McNugget body pillow."""
02:01:34;02:01:35;"You know what I mean?"
02:01:35;02:01:36;"It's not a direct collab."
02:01:36;02:01:39;"He's like McKinsey or something."
02:01:39;02:01:41;"He's a consulting agency being like,"
02:01:41;02:01:43;"""You guys should be in the body pillow business."""
02:01:43;02:01:44;"- That's right."
02:01:44;02:01:47;"It's almost like a creative director capacity beyond"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"just because he's an artist."
02:01:48;02:01:51;"So they wanna mine his beautiful brain"
02:01:51;02:01:54;"for some of these more adventurous ideas"
02:01:54;02:01:58;"like the CJ Arches jorts that he's selling."
02:01:58;02:02:03;"These are denim jean shorts that are being sold for $250"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"and they have the McDonald's, the golden arches"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"with some sort of like French fry,"
02:02:07;02:02:09;"like cactus jack flares."
02:02:09;02:02:12;"- But so Seinfeld, you being a bit of a hype beast,"
02:02:12;02:02:13;"would you cop any of this stuff?"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"- Well, I'm so glad you asked Ezra"
02:02:15;02:02:19;"because I will say that a few of these shirts"
02:02:19;02:02:20;"of which there are so many,"
02:02:20;02:02:24;"I'm counting about 30 different t-shirt options here."
02:02:24;02:02:26;"Some of them are kinda jazzy"
02:02:26;02:02:30;"and there's one with the Travis Scott custom action figure"
02:02:30;02:02:31;"and some real 90s style,"
02:02:31;02:02:35;"almost like what looks like a Nike retro design"
02:02:35;02:02:41;"from 1996, just a real loud sort of print"
02:02:41;02:02:42;"and there's some tie dye stuff in there."
02:02:42;02:02:44;"But the thing that was a real deal breaker for me"
02:02:44;02:02:47;"because I thought, oh, this might be a cool thing"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"in 20 years, oh, this was like a weird thing"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"that McDonald's did and now it's like got some value"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"or some cachet to it."
02:02:54;02:02:58;"But wearing clothing with the McDonald's logo on it,"
02:02:58;02:02:59;"that's like a deal breaker for me."
02:02:59;02:03:00;"And Jake, I don't know if you remember,"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"but at one point on our text thread,"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"I was like, I think this was months ago,"
02:03:04;02:03:07;"but I was like, I don't understand Coca-Cola"
02:03:07;02:03:10;"as like a thing that people wanna wear on their clothes."
02:03:10;02:03:11;"Do you remember that?"
02:03:11;02:03:14;"I was like, yeah, what's the appeal"
02:03:14;02:03:17;"of wearing a big ad for Coca-Cola?"
02:03:17;02:03:20;"Like I see nothing cool about that."
02:03:20;02:03:23;"And I got the same vibe from this collaboration,"
02:03:23;02:03:24;"which is like, regardless of how much"
02:03:24;02:03:29;"of Travis's design instincts or whatever,"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"you're still walking around"
02:03:31;02:03:33;"with a big McDonald's ad on your shirt,"
02:03:33;02:03:36;"which to me, I think the interesting part"
02:03:36;02:03:38;"of this collaboration is that try as they might"
02:03:38;02:03:41;"to make McDonald's, the logo seem cool."
02:03:41;02:03:43;"It's a bridge too far."
02:03:43;02:03:44;"I just can't go there."
02:03:44;02:03:47;"You know, I can't go all the way with you, Travis."
02:03:47;02:03:48;"- It's also cool if it's vintage,"
02:03:48;02:03:50;"like, well, I guess you could debate it,"
02:03:50;02:03:53;"but I have at times, mostly just on stage,"
02:03:53;02:03:56;"there's a while where I had this, I don't know why,"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"but in the 80s, there was this thing"
02:03:59;02:04:02;"where they made Coca-Cola rugby shirts."
02:04:02;02:04:04;"And obviously I've always loved rugby shirts."
02:04:04;02:04:06;"It's been like part of my early look"
02:04:06;02:04:07;"and I actually felt like it's cool."
02:04:07;02:04:10;"And I always see those at vintage stores"
02:04:10;02:04:12;"and I'm always like kind of charmed by them,"
02:04:12;02:04:13;"but that feels a little different"
02:04:13;02:04:16;"than buying like a brand new Coca-Cola t-shirt."
02:04:16;02:04:17;"And it's funny, as we've been talking about this,"
02:04:17;02:04:18;"I was starting to remember,"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"like, I feel like in the 90s,"
02:04:20;02:04:23;"marijuana parody shirts was like a huge thing."
02:04:23;02:04:23;"- Yes."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"- So I've been looking some up,"
02:04:25;02:04:28;"like there's vegan ones that just say McMurder."
02:04:28;02:04:30;"That's pretty harsh to wear."
02:04:30;02:04:31;"But the really funny ones,"
02:04:31;02:04:34;"it's just the McDonald's golden arches M"
02:04:34;02:04:35;"and then it says marijuana."
02:04:35;02:04:37;"I feel like that's like a classic."
02:04:37;02:04:38;"- That's a classic."
02:04:38;02:04:40;"- That's like a classic boardwalk shirt."
02:04:40;02:04:42;"- Yeah, definitely boardwalk."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"And I guess there's some that were sold"
02:04:43;02:04:45;"as like tourist things in Mexico."
02:04:45;02:04:48;"Like I'm seeing, you know, that kind of like,"
02:04:48;02:04:50;"they call it a hoodie."
02:04:50;02:04:51;"I've always heard it called a Baja,"
02:04:51;02:04:53;"you know, like the Mexican pullover."
02:04:53;02:04:53;"- Oh, sure."
02:04:53;02:04:54;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
02:04:54;02:04:58;"So this is a white Baja with the marijuana on it."
02:04:58;02:05:02;"It just says marijuana over 1 billion stoned, Mexico."
02:05:02;02:05:04;"- It's funny."
02:05:04;02:05:05;"- It's kind of cool."
02:05:05;02:05:08;"- The first time I ever saw those McDonald's marijuana shirts"
02:05:08;02:05:10;"was in Mexico when I was a kid."
02:05:10;02:05:11;"- Oh, really?"
02:05:11;02:05:13;"- And being like, oh, that's so bad-ass."
02:05:13;02:05:14;"Yeah, yeah."
02:05:14;02:05:15;"- I think I'd wear a marijuana,"
02:05:15;02:05:18;"McDonald's parody long sleeve t-shirt."
02:05:18;02:05:19;"Let me see if I can find one."
02:05:19;02:05:20;"So anyway."
02:05:20;02:05:23;"- This episode is ending with Ezra"
02:05:23;02:05:28;"just like browsing for like McDonald's parody shirts."
02:05:28;02:05:30;"- That's right."
02:05:30;02:05:31;"I'm going to find a bunch."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"I'll give you guys some too."
02:05:33;02:05:35;"All right, well, I'm just going to keep browsing."
02:05:35;02:05:38;"I got to get my head back into the browsing game."
02:05:38;02:05:39;"That's it for TC."
02:05:39;02:05:40;"See you guys in two weeks."
02:05:40;02:05:41;"Peace."
