00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:04;00:09;"On this week's episode, we dig into two new songs from up and coming band Vampire Weekend."
00:09;00:14;"We also briefly discuss this year's festivals, including the Skull and Roses Grateful Dead"
00:14;00:20;"Festival in Ventura, all this, plus the greatest hits of 2019 and 1969."
00:20;00:25;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:15;01:18;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:18;01:19;"Hello, Jake."
01:19;01:20;"Hey, man."
01:20;01:21;"Episode 90."
01:21;01:22;"Really?"
01:22;01:23;"Spring 90."
01:23;01:24;"Oh my God."
01:24;01:25;"Yeah, spring 90."
01:25;01:28;"Great time for the Grateful Dead."
01:28;01:33;"I'm not a real head about the 90s stuff, but the people that I know that are full dead"
01:33;01:36;"completists all swear by spring 90."
01:36;01:42;"I feel like a few years ago, there was an officially released best of the whole spring"
01:42;01:43;"of 1990."
01:43;01:44;"Right."
01:44;01:48;"For people who don't know, hardcore Grateful Dead heads, people have their favorite years"
01:48;01:51;"and their favorite eras, and clearly their favorite, not even just full year, is their"
01:51;01:53;"favorite season of a year."
01:53;01:55;"Spring 77 is a very-"
01:55;01:56;"It's a classic."
01:56;01:57;"Classic time."
01:57;02:02;"I wonder if even real hardcore dead heads are kind of like spring 77 is overrated."
02:02;02:03;"Oh, I'm sure."
02:03;02:07;"You remember a few years ago, they released that Cornell 77 show?"
02:07;02:08;"Sure."
02:08;02:09;"That was really trumpeted to everybody."
02:09;02:12;"It's like, ""Hey, maybe you don't know that much about the Grateful Dead, but this is"
02:12;02:14;"considered their best show."""
02:14;02:19;"I feel like in any community, the people who are just real heads are probably like, ""Oh"
02:19;02:20;"yeah, entry level."""
02:20;02:24;"I can see why you might think that's the best Grateful Dead show ever, but actually-"
02:24;02:28;"Actually, dude, May 3rd, 90."
02:28;02:35;"Was spring 90 kind of like some of the last great recordings with Brent?"
02:35;02:37;"Yeah, I think Brent died-"
02:37;02:38;"The end of the Brent era."
02:38;02:39;"... summer or fall of 90."
02:39;02:40;"Oh, damn."
02:40;02:42;"To be replaced by Bruce Hornsby."
02:42;02:43;"Among others."
02:43;02:44;"Yeah."
02:44;02:45;"Vince Walnick."
02:45;02:46;"Right."
02:46;02:50;"Yeah, to me, spring 90- This is not exactly where we plan on taking the show."
02:50;02:55;"Sorry, I just saw on the sheet it said episode 90, and it's like, ""It's springtime now."""
02:55;02:57;"I've thrown on spring 90 a bunch."
02:57;03:01;"I mean, the number one thing that differentiates it is the keyboard sounds."
03:01;03:02;"There's these kind of like-"
03:02;03:03;"Should we throw some on?"
03:03;03:04;"... more of a synthy."
03:04;03:08;"All right, let's throw on some spring 90 just so people know what we're talking about."
03:08;03:09;"Episode 90, though."
03:09;03:10;"That's crazy."
03:10;03:11;"Respect."
03:11;03:12;"Respect to us."
03:12;03:15;"We're out here doing it, man."
03:15;03:16;"Twice a month."
03:16;03:19;"To all the haters who thought Time Crisis was a fluke, you know what's funny?"
03:19;03:24;"We'll talk about it more in a second, but I just did a full week of press in the UK,"
03:24;03:29;"and I found that a thing that a lot of journalists say to me lately is like, ""Well, so you've"
03:29;03:30;"been gone for six years."
03:30;03:31;"Can we talk about that?"""
03:31;03:32;"I'm like, ""Sure."""
03:32;03:35;"They're like, ""That's a really long time to be gone between albums."""
03:35;03:37;"But it's not like you've exactly been sitting around."
03:37;03:38;"You've been busy."
03:38;03:40;"I mean, you made a cartoon."
03:40;03:42;"You wrote a song for Beyonce."
03:42;03:44;"You've been doing a radio show."
03:44;03:47;"At first, I kind of rolled with it, and I was like, ""Yeah, you're right."""
03:47;03:50;"Then lately, I've just been kind of like, ""Well, let's keep it real."""
03:50;03:51;"There was a lot of sitting around, too."
03:51;03:56;"I was like, ""Time Crisis is four hours a month."""
03:56;03:59;"The Beyonce song was one song over six years."
03:59;04:04;"To be fair, the cartoon was time-consuming, but even that was one specific year."
04:04;04:09;"Oh, I like this West LA fadeaway."
04:09;04:17;"March 22, 1990."
04:17;04:19;"I'm sure this is very sacrilegious."
04:19;04:23;"I always think about this when I end up looking at some Grateful Dead message board"
04:23;04:28;"and people are fighting tooth and nail about which performance was better."
04:28;04:30;"Maybe this is because I'm a studio guy."
04:30;04:35;"I just want to be like, ""I know you guys think that Jerry's solo on Scarlet Begonia's"
04:35;04:41;"was way more lyrical that year, but you also just like the recording quality better"
04:41;04:43;"of certain bootlegs than others."""
04:43;04:45;"Sure, just the sound."
04:45;04:48;"It's one thing to be like, ""I was at these two shows, and this one had a different vibe."""
04:48;04:52;"But there's also parts--because I just listen to these, and it sounds--"
04:52;04:54;"Reverby, chorus-y."
04:54;04:57;"That drum sound just wouldn't exist in another era."
04:57;04:59;"Yeah, it doesn't sound like '72."
04:59;05:01;"I know that the playing's a little bit different, too."
05:01;05:04;"No, I agree completely. I feel like it's the tones."
05:04;05:07;"This is an '80s song. Let's play an actual '70s song."
05:07;05:09;"I mean, dude, tasteful palette, man."
05:09;05:11;"Right, 1990 is not your favorite palette."
05:11;05:13;"It's not a good palette."
05:13;05:17;"Which is why I don't connect with spring '90. I know people swear by it."
05:17;05:21;"I also feel like these recordings--just everything sounds a little more distant than like--"
05:21;05:25;"I mean, Europe '72, it almost sounds like a studio recording."
05:25;05:30;"It does. There might have been some tomfoolery with Europe '72."
05:30;05:33;"Maybe some vocal overdubs."
05:33;05:35;"Is that some organ up there?"
05:35;05:37;"This sounds terrible."
05:38;05:40;"[playing]"
05:40;05:52;"The playing's different, but the sounds are also--"
05:52;05:54;"It's just hard to know what's hitting you first."
05:54;05:55;"Yeah."
05:55;05:57;"I don't know how to describe it."
05:57;06:00;"All these spring '90 recordings, the officially released ones at least,"
06:00;06:02;"they feel like airy."
06:02;06:04;"Maybe because they're literally in bigger rooms, you know?"
06:04;06:07;"They're like arenas and stadiums."
06:07;06:09;"[playing]"
06:09;06:22;"Now I'm curious. Put on '77 Cornell, Scarlett Begonia's."
06:22;06:27;"And I bet the tempo will be different, but the tone, like the palette will be way different."
06:27;06:28;"Not so wet."
06:28;06:29;"Right."
06:29;06:32;"All right, so we're going back in time 13 years."
06:32;06:34;"Spring '90."
06:34;06:35;"I love that it's only 13 years."
06:35;06:36;"I know."
06:36;06:45;"It's already just such a better sounding recording even before they start playing."
06:45;06:49;"All right, now we're going to play everybody's favorite fun game, Move Back."
06:49;06:52;"Oh yeah, this is Bobby Chet. I'm Chet. I'm skipping ahead."
06:52;06:54;"[playing]"
06:54;06:57;"It's such a different--"
06:57;06:58;"So close."
06:58;07:00;"--mic situation already."
07:00;07:02;"[playing]"
07:02;07:06;"Those Phil Bass bombs."
07:06;07:07;"Yeah."
07:07;07:13;"Pretty similar tempo actually."
07:13;07:15;"[playing]"
07:18;07:38;"I'm not even an audiophile, but I'm just a studio dude."
07:38;07:39;"Yeah."
07:39;07:42;"I just feel like the idea that I could listen to these two recordings"
07:42;07:47;"and just kind of be like, focus on the playing is so hard for me."
07:47;07:50;"I don't know if the tempo or the vibe is that different."
07:50;07:52;"It's just drastically different recordings."
07:52;07:54;"[playing]"
08:10;08:12;"Anyway, episode--"
08:12;08:13;"Little dead detour there."
08:13;08:15;"Episode 90."
08:15;08:17;"This again, we're going to be very straightforward this year."
08:17;08:19;"This is a pre-recorded episode."
08:19;08:20;"But you know what, man?"
08:20;08:23;"It's going out live, so it's not a rerun."
08:23;08:24;"It's new content."
08:24;08:26;"It's new content airing live."
08:26;08:30;"You know, it's like when Game of Thrones comes back on TV,"
08:30;08:32;"you're going to be like, ""It's not live."""
08:32;08:34;"You know? Same thing."
08:34;08:37;"They taped that like six months ago, man."
08:37;08:40;"Yeah, sometimes I'm watching GOT and I just think about the fact that"
08:40;08:45;"they probably wrote it like two years ago, filmed it minimum a year ago."
08:45;08:46;"It feels stale."
08:46;08:47;"Not current."
08:47;08:49;"It's not."
08:49;08:50;"So this is like a Game of Thrones."
08:50;08:53;"Anyway, got a lot of traveling."
08:53;08:55;"Yeah, man. So you were in the UK?"
08:55;08:57;"I was in the UK for a week."
08:57;09:01;"Vampire Weekend played three shows and also just did a ton of interviews."
09:01;09:03;"What sort of rooms were you playing?"
09:03;09:06;"We billed them as our three little London shows."
09:06;09:09;"We played a venue called Earth in Hackney."
09:09;09:11;"I think that was like about 850."
09:11;09:12;"It's a chill name."
09:12;09:14;"So basically we played Thursday night at this place, Earth."
09:14;09:17;"Then on Friday we moved into this place called Islington Assembly Hall,"
09:17;09:18;"which is probably 600 or 700."
09:18;09:20;"We played there Friday night."
09:20;09:23;"And then real quick turnaround, similar to the legendary Ohio Weekend"
09:23;09:26;"with Richard Pictures, we came back Saturday morning."
09:26;09:27;"Same venue."
09:28;09:30;"So we did three shows in about 36 hours."
09:30;09:31;"Saturday morning show?"
09:31;09:32;"Yeah."
09:32;09:33;"What time?"
09:33;09:34;"Hit the stage at 10 a.m."
09:34;09:36;"Why?"
09:36;09:39;"Well, I've had this instinct for a long time that Vampire Weekend"
09:39;09:40;"should do morning shows."
09:40;09:42;"I mean, it's the same reason why in Ojai we could have done"
09:42;09:43;"Saturday night, Sunday night."
09:43;09:44;"Right."
09:44;09:48;"But I had this feeling, which I think has become a little bit of a trend now."
09:48;09:51;"Kanye's been doing these kind of outdoor Sunday morning jams."
09:51;09:52;"Really?"
09:52;09:53;"Yeah."
09:53;09:54;"Where does he do those?"
09:54;09:55;"I believe at his home in Calabasas."
09:55;09:56;"Invite only."
09:56;09:58;"I think invite only."
09:58;10:03;"They're called Sunday services and he has like a gospel choir singing his stuff."
10:03;10:05;"I mean, in his case, I think there's also a religious angle."
10:05;10:06;"Okay."
10:06;10:09;"It's kind of about the music, but it's also a little bit of just--it's like church."
10:09;10:11;"But anyway, you know, great minds think alike."
10:11;10:15;"Vampire Weekend pioneered the Sunday morning show about a year ago."
10:15;10:17;"You know, it's like when you're hanging out."
10:17;10:19;"It's like spend Saturday night going out to the bar."
10:19;10:21;"Let's get brunch on Sunday."
10:21;10:24;"And also I feel like on Sundays there's still good vibes Sunday morning."
10:24;10:27;"By Sunday night, awful."
10:27;10:29;"Those Sunday night dreads."
10:29;10:30;"Yeah, the worst."
10:30;10:31;"Like when you're in school."
10:31;10:35;"I guess being at a show on a Sunday night is maybe a way to avoid the dread."
10:35;10:37;"I guess if you go to a concert on Sunday night, you're a little bit like,"
10:37;10:39;"""Wait, what day is it?"""
10:39;10:40;"Yeah."
10:40;10:44;"Better than just sitting at home watching Game of Thrones."
10:44;10:46;"Just watching a stale ass--"
10:46;10:47;"Watching billions."
10:47;10:49;"--pre-taped Game of Thrones."
10:49;10:52;"Just thinking about how you got to go to work or school."
10:52;10:57;"The only thing that I'll say about a Sunday night vibe is that in times in my life,"
10:57;11:01;"like the aforementioned six years between albums,"
11:01;11:04;"some of these moments where I actually didn't have all that much to do,"
11:04;11:07;"where I'm kind of waiting to really start in earnest on a project,"
11:07;11:11;"when I've had obviously the privilege of not having work on Monday,"
11:11;11:14;"but also occasionally a little too much free time,"
11:14;11:19;"I will say that there are times where on a Sunday night I almost have a good vibe"
11:19;11:23;"because I'm like, ""You know what? I need the Monday morning reboot."""
11:23;11:27;"Otherwise, I feel like this endless-- I'm living in an endless weekend."
11:27;11:28;"Right."
11:28;11:30;"And my life is lacking meaning and direction."
11:30;11:33;"At least tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll be Monday,"
11:33;11:36;"and if I go to the coffee shop, I'll look around and be like, ""Yeah."""
11:36;11:37;"You're a part of the world."
11:37;11:38;"I'm a part of the world."
11:38;11:39;"There's a little hustle and bustle."
11:39;11:40;"Yeah."
11:40;11:42;"So anyway, I've always liked the idea of morning shows,"
11:42;11:44;"and I always thought it suited Vampire Weekend."
11:44;11:46;"I mean, come on, wasn't it a good vibe in Ojai?"
11:46;11:47;"It's great."
11:47;11:50;"I think you guys played at like noon or one, though, in Ojai."
11:50;11:53;"I think Pictures played at like 10."
11:53;11:54;"11?"
11:54;11:55;"Maybe 10 or 11."
11:55;11:57;"Maybe you guys were 10, 30, 11, and we were like noon."
11:57;11:58;"Yeah."
11:58;12:01;"Hitting the stage-- Headliner, was there an opener?"
12:01;12:03;"No, there are no openers at any of these shows."
12:03;12:04;"That's tight."
12:04;12:09;"So hitting the stage at 10 in an indoor club is funny."
12:09;12:11;"This place-- I don't fully understand this."
12:11;12:14;"It's literally like the-- I'm going to get this wrong."
12:14;12:18;"Islington I think of as like a neighborhood in London,"
12:18;12:22;"but it's also like an official neighborhood too."
12:22;12:25;"They have a little council for that area."
12:25;12:26;"Okay."
12:26;12:28;"Like West Hollywood or something."
12:28;12:29;"Yeah, kind of."
12:29;12:31;"So it's like a place that has a lot of public meetings"
12:31;12:34;"and maybe even like the city council might do stuff."
12:34;12:35;"I don't know."
12:35;12:38;"It has a stage, but it also almost seems like a community center type place."
12:38;12:40;"So anyway, there's big windows."
12:40;12:43;"Actually, the vibe was like you got some sunlight coming in plus some lights."
12:43;12:46;"It wasn't like crowding people into like a dank--"
12:46;12:48;"Windowless."
12:48;12:49;"Yeah."
12:49;12:53;"I think of all these like pre-album shows a little bit as like attended rehearsals."
12:53;12:54;"Yeah."
12:54;12:56;"Where it's kind of like, ""Yo, it's mellow."""
12:56;12:58;"Like we're not here putting on the show."
12:58;13:00;"You know, we only have four new songs out."
13:00;13:01;"Did you play the new material?"
13:01;13:02;"Oh, yeah."
13:02;13:03;"Nice."
13:03;13:04;"That was cool because it was the first time we ever played--"
13:04;13:05;"Harmony."
13:05;13:07;"Harmony, Big Blue, 2021, Sunflower."
13:07;13:08;"Damn."
13:08;13:11;"And we got some special spins on some of them live,"
13:11;13:13;"especially 2021 and Big Blue."
13:13;13:14;"Like they're so short--"
13:14;13:15;"Yeah."
13:15;13:16;"--in the official version."
13:16;13:18;"We have like a couple versions now."
13:18;13:19;"Where you take it out."
13:19;13:21;"Yeah, just extend it a little bit."
13:21;13:24;"And not even like jamming necessarily, but just like more parts."
13:24;13:25;"[MUSIC - BIG BLUE, ""HARMONY""]"
13:25;13:28;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
13:28;13:31;"I was so overcome with emotion."
13:31;13:34;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
13:34;13:38;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
13:38;13:41;"Then you offered protection."
13:41;13:44;"So am I learning my lesson?"
13:44;13:47;"Or am I back on my own?"
13:47;13:54;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
13:54;13:57;"I was so overcome with emotion."
13:57;14:00;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:00;14:04;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:04;14:07;"Then you offered protection."
14:07;14:10;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:10;14:12;"Or am I back on my own?"
14:13;14:17;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
14:17;14:20;"I was so overcome with emotion."
14:20;14:23;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:23;14:27;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:27;14:30;"Then you offered protection."
14:30;14:33;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:33;14:37;"Or am I back on my own?"
14:37;14:41;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
14:41;14:44;"I was so overcome with emotion."
14:44;14:47;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
14:47;14:51;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
14:51;14:54;"Then you offered protection."
14:54;14:57;"So am I learning my lesson?"
14:57;15:00;"Or am I back on my own?"
15:00;15:07;"So it was a good vibe there, and I would say that the Saturday morning show is my favorite."
15:07;15:12;"And actually, at that one, historically I think a lot of our shows would be like 80 minutes."
15:12;15:16;"Even on the third album, the Saturday morning show is two hours, two minutes."
15:16;15:17;"Strong."
15:17;15:18;"25 songs."
15:18;15:19;"That's strong."
15:19;15:20;"Including three A-Punks."
15:20;15:21;"It was a good vibe."
15:21;15:25;"We busted out our Paul Simon cover for the first time."
15:25;15:26;"Which one?"
15:26;15:27;"Late in the Evening."
15:27;15:28;"Do you know this song?"
15:28;15:29;"Oh yeah."
15:29;15:31;"[singing]"
15:31;15:32;"Yep."
15:32;15:35;"It was late in the evening, late in the evening."
15:35;15:36;"Yep."
15:36;15:37;"It was late in the evening."
15:37;15:38;"Yeah."
15:38;15:40;"Is that on the One Trick Pony album?"
15:40;15:41;"I think so."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:43;15:44;"It's kind of like a precursor to Graceland."
15:44;15:46;"Yeah, so all the shows went well."
15:46;15:48;"And we did like these radio sessions."
15:48;15:49;"We had to cover..."
15:49;15:50;"Full band?"
15:50;15:51;"Yeah, that was full band."
15:51;15:52;"That sounds hectic."
15:52;15:54;"We did kind of like a stripped-down Harmony Hall live."
15:54;15:59;"Oh, and then so there's this thing on Radio 1 in England called Live Lounge."
15:59;16:03;"You perform your song, and then you perform a cover of a current hit."
16:03;16:07;"Last time we did it, five, six years ago, we did Blurred Lines."
16:07;16:08;"Okay."
16:08;16:10;"A song that hasn't aged particularly well."
16:10;16:13;"But I was kind of like just thinking about like what is a hit now?"
16:13;16:14;"And I'm like..."
16:14;16:15;"Small Charcoal Grill."
16:15;16:18;"No, yeah, we were like we're going to do Seven Rings by Ariana Grande."
16:18;16:19;"They would have been like, brilliant."
16:19;16:20;"That's a huge hit."
16:20;16:21;"Awesome."
16:21;16:22;"That'll be a whole thing."
16:22;16:24;"Vampire Weekend covers Ariana Grande."
16:24;16:28;"That'll be something people click on for a day."
16:28;16:30;"Oh, people will click on that to make fun of you guys."
16:30;16:31;"That's awesome."
16:31;16:32;"Let's do it."
16:32;16:34;"And then I just get up there, and we start playing the beat."
16:34;16:36;"And then just for three and a half minutes, I just go,"
16:36;16:39;"""Small Charcoal Grill. Small Charcoal Grill."""
16:39;16:40;"That's live?"
16:40;16:41;"Yeah, just live on radio."
16:41;16:44;"They'd probably cut it and just be like, ""We are so sorry."
16:44;16:47;"This is so disrespectful to the Live Lounge Institution."""
16:47;16:49;"But anyway, I was talking to one of our managers, John."
16:49;16:55;"This test of the emergency broadcasting system."
16:55;16:56;"You were talking to?"
16:56;16:58;"John from our management company."
16:58;17:02;"At first, I was a little bit like, ""Oh, man, I feel a little old for that."""
17:02;17:03;"And I like it."
17:03;17:04;"It can be a good vibe."
17:04;17:05;"Sure."
17:05;17:06;"The host is super cool over there."
17:06;17:10;"But it's just one of those things where it's like it can easily go so wrong."
17:10;17:11;"Yeah."
17:11;17:13;"I just couldn't think of a pop song that would feel right."
17:13;17:15;"And I'm still not sure that we--"
17:15;17:17;"Was it something that's been in the top five of this show ever?"
17:17;17:18;"Oh, yeah."
17:18;17:19;"Hold on, hold on."
17:19;17:20;"I got to guess."
17:20;17:23;"So I'm just saying to him, I'm like, ""What song could Vampire Weekend cover?"
17:23;17:26;"We're just going to seem kind of awkward."""
17:26;17:30;"And he pitched one that at least I appreciated just because it was kind of funny"
17:30;17:33;"in terms of how it connected back to us."
17:33;17:34;"Sunflower?"
17:34;17:35;"Mm-hmm."
17:35;17:36;"Cool."
17:36;17:37;"Tough to do, though."
17:37;17:39;"Yeah, we did this kind of like--"
17:39;17:40;"Our version was kind of vibey."
17:40;17:44;"And we threw in some little teases to other songs."
17:44;17:47;"A little bit of China Cat, a little bit of Our Sunflower,"
17:47;17:48;"and a little bit of Harmony Hall."
17:48;17:49;"Sick."
17:49;17:50;"Just to drive the point home."
17:50;17:51;"I think it turned out all right."
17:51;17:54;"I'm not going to play it, but you guys can check it out online."
17:54;17:58;"So we did stuff like that, and then I just sat and did just days of press,"
17:58;17:59;"which is funny because--"
17:59;18:00;"Like in a hotel suite?"
18:00;18:01;"Classic, yeah."
18:01;18:02;"In a hotel suite."
18:02;18:03;"Oh, my God."
18:03;18:05;"I was so jet-lagged, too, but I was just like super high on coffee"
18:05;18:07;"just talking to people for like seven hours."
18:07;18:08;"Jesus."
18:08;18:11;"A lot of British journalists, a lot of European journalists come to London."
18:11;18:13;"Like some people fly in for the day to talk or they're based there."
18:13;18:14;"Wow."
18:14;18:15;"You know, German people and Belgian people."
18:15;18:17;"Oh, so it's all European press."
18:17;18:18;"Just about."
18:18;18:20;"There's somebody from Japan there."
18:20;18:22;"What percentage mentioned Time Crisis?"
18:22;18:23;"A few."
18:23;18:24;"Actually, it was funny."
18:24;18:25;"Like 25%?"
18:25;18:27;"Yeah, there was a cool guy from Ireland."
18:27;18:28;"He was funny."
18:28;18:29;"I appreciated it."
18:29;18:31;"He just like kicked it off with like maybe two non sequiturs kind of like"
18:31;18:32;"that weren't about the album."
18:32;18:35;"He was just like, ""It's very tempting to try to do this in an Irish accent,"
18:35;18:37;"but I won't out of respect."""
18:37;18:39;"He just like was like, ""All right, man."
18:39;18:42;"So seems like I got some kind of beef with the space cowboy."""
18:42;18:43;"And I was like, ""What?"""
18:43;18:45;"And he's like, ""Steve Miller, what's up with that?"""
18:45;18:46;"And I was like, ""Well."""
18:46;18:47;"He did his homework."
18:47;18:49;"Yeah, and talked about that."
18:49;18:54;"And then he said, ""I think I've played this on Time Crisis before."
18:54;18:58;"You know that we did like a reggae cover of Conte Partiro before?"""
18:58;18:59;"Yeah, I think this has come up."
18:59;19:01;"Wait, what is that song again?"
19:01;19:03;"It's like a pop opera song."
19:03;19:05;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yep."
19:05;19:07;"This is where I try to sing in Italian."
19:07;19:09;"So he was also funny."
19:09;19:12;"He said, ""You did this cover of Conte Partiro, huh?"""
19:12;19:13;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
19:13;19:15;"And he's like, ""Not your finest hour."
19:15;19:16;"What was up with that?"""
19:16;19:18;"I was like, ""Damn."""
19:18;19:20;"Okay, fair point."
19:20;19:23;"And I was like, ""Well, it was for a Starbucks compilation."""
19:23;19:25;"He was cool, though."
19:26;19:28;"[singing in Italian]"
19:31;19:57;"We gotta get to the chorus."
19:57;19:59;"[singing in Italian]"
19:59;20:02;"Sounds pretty good."
20:02;20:07;"I would argue this is Vampire Begins Finest Hour."
20:07;20:10;"I think the vocals are strong."
20:10;20:13;"I think the beat, not as."
20:13;20:16;"But you're holding it down with the foreign language, dude."
20:16;20:17;"Thank you."
20:17;20:20;"I'm not sure what a native Italian speaker would say."
20:20;20:24;"But it was interesting to also finally talk to people who have heard the album."
20:24;20:26;"That's pretty wild."
20:26;20:28;"To talk to strangers who have heard the album."
20:28;20:30;"I haven't had that experience yet."
20:30;20:33;"I'm only interested in people that want to talk about time crisis."
20:33;20:34;"Yeah."
20:34;20:36;"Well, let me think of anybody that's been in a time crisis."
20:36;20:38;"No, but like I said, there was a lot of that."
20:38;20:40;"Just like, ""So you've been keeping real busy."""
20:40;20:41;"I always think about that, too."
20:41;20:43;"That's a four-hour-a-week-- four-hour-a-month commitment."
20:43;20:47;"I always think about that, because that's such a classic cliche of music writing."
20:47;20:50;"I guess they're trying to be charitable when people are just talking about--"
20:50;20:53;"Somebody's been gone, but they've been keeping real busy."
20:53;20:57;"As a music industry professional, I look at the list, and I'm always kind of like--"
20:57;21:01;"It's never just like, ""Drove a truck for Walmart for two years."""
21:01;21:07;"It's always like, ""From hosting their own podcast to recording three songs with another producer"
21:07;21:09;"to acting in a TV show for a week."""
21:09;21:11;"The past seven years have been--"
21:11;21:12;"It's always like that."
21:12;21:14;"And then that's when you go super Jim Morrison."
21:14;21:17;"You're like, ""What's up with this obsession with keeping busy?"""
21:17;21:21;"I resent this idea that I kept busy, let alone that I should keep busy."
21:21;21:22;"I did not keep busy."
21:22;21:25;"I actually just stared at a tree for a full year."
21:25;21:27;"Yeah, I watched television."
21:27;21:29;"I watched a lot of reality television."
21:29;21:31;"I let it wash over me."
21:31;21:34;"I ordered from Wingstop on Uber Eats."
21:34;21:35;"Gained a lot of weight."
21:35;21:36;"I gained a lot of weight."
21:36;21:39;"I watched YouTube videos and not tutorials."
21:50;21:52;"So people who had heard the album--"
21:52;21:55;"That was kind of interesting, although I did find that--"
21:55;21:59;"It is funny, too, when you talk to so many people, you almost start to develop talking points"
21:59;22:00;"over the course of a week."
22:00;22:01;"Sure."
22:01;22:02;"Because at first--"
22:02;22:03;"[laughs]"
22:03;22:07;"That makes me immediately think of, ""There's 100 people in the room."""
22:07;22:09;"Oh, yeah, yeah. I have more sympathy for her after that."
22:09;22:10;"Sure."
22:10;22:13;"I at least try to keep it real when I'm talking to people."
22:13;22:15;"Also, it's very artificial, and I think the journalists know that, too."
22:15;22:21;"Although I will point out that there are some profiles of people, like a written profile,"
22:21;22:25;"where legitimately they gave access to the person for weeks."
22:25;22:27;"They were shadowed somebody for weeks."
22:27;22:29;"That's wild. Like a Long New Yorker profile?"
22:29;22:30;"A Long New Yorker profile."
22:30;22:33;"Let's say at a Long New Yorker profile, they minimum spent 10 hours with the person,"
22:33;22:34;"even if it's spread out."
22:34;22:35;"Yeah."
22:35;22:37;"A lot of these interviews, you sit down for like 20 minutes."
22:37;22:38;"Right."
22:38;22:42;"I also found that that's a funny cliche of music writing sometimes is like--"
22:42;22:46;"And you got a feel for the writers, and I know some people who do this for a living."
22:46;22:49;"And I didn't even think about it until I started doing it, too,"
22:49;22:55;"but it's that vibe of kind of just like, ""I sat down with Lady Gaga at the Bowery Hotel in New York."
22:55;22:58;"She ordered a chamomile tea with honey."""
22:58;23:02;"And they try to pull these details out as if that's a place she was like unguarded."
23:02;23:05;"""Won't you come meet me at the Bowery Hotel?"
23:05;23:08;"This is where I can be myself and order the things that I like."""
23:08;23:12;"There was like an infamous profile years ago where this woman really tried to take down MIA,"
23:12;23:16;"and the whole thing was like, ""I sat down with her at the Beverly Hills Hotel,"
23:16;23:17;"and she ordered truffle fries."""
23:17;23:21;"It became this thing because she was trying to say MIA is not a woman of the people."
23:21;23:23;"She got that decadent truffle."
23:23;23:24;"And then the most hilarious part is--"
23:24;23:25;"Very fragrant flavor."
23:25;23:29;"--later the tape came out, and the woman says to her like, ""You want to order some food?"""
23:29;23:31;"And she's like, ""Yeah, I'm a little hungry."""
23:31;23:33;"And she's like, ""The truffle fries here are unbelievable."""
23:33;23:35;"[explosion]"
23:35;23:37;"So it's like so extra."
23:37;23:38;"That's brutal."
23:38;23:42;"But I'm saying even if MIA ordered the truffle fries, this is like a totally artificial situation."
23:42;23:43;"Yeah."
23:43;23:45;"Plus it's on brand for MIA."
23:45;23:46;"To order truffle fries?"
23:46;23:47;"Absolutely."
23:47;23:48;"I guess this person didn't feel that way."
23:48;23:50;"It's outrageous. It's decadent."
23:50;23:51;"Is that--"
23:51;23:52;"I don't know."
23:52;23:57;"I'm just like-- if I'm guessing, if you were like, ""Jake, what kind of fries would MIA order?"
23:57;23:58;"Sweet potato?"""
23:58;23:59;"Yeah."
23:59;24:01;"Regular? Crinkle cut? Or truffle?"
24:01;24:02;"Yeah."
24:02;24:03;"I'd go with truffle."
24:03;24:05;"Crinkle cut."
24:05;24:07;"Tater tots?"
24:07;24:13;"I'd actually say if you sit down with a journalist at a fancy hotel, it's actually more extra to ask for a crinkle cut."
24:13;24:14;"Yeah."
24:14;24:17;"Could someone go out and buy a bag of Ore-Ida frozen crinkle cut?"
24:17;24:21;"The poor waiter, ""Ma'am, we serve truffle fries here. This is a fancy restaurant."""
24:21;24:25;"""Well, I'm just a normal person, man. I want some crinkle cut."""
24:25;24:28;"""It would be much easier for me if you just ordered the truffle fries."
24:28;24:31;"We have a whole system. They're always making them around the clock."""
24:31;24:34;"I'm sure that actually-- not quite that, but I'm sure that has actually happened in some way."
24:34;24:40;"Like, a person with working class roots who now is clearly rich and famous sits down with a journalist at a fancy restaurant"
24:40;24:46;"and tries to have some moment of class solidarity with the waiter that just makes the waiter's job way harder."
24:46;24:47;"Oh."
24:47;24:48;"Inadvertently."
24:48;24:51;"""Hey, bro. Let me get a beer."""
24:51;24:55;"""Um, all right, sir. We have a-- on tap, we have a Hefeweizen."""
24:55;24:58;"""No, man. A regular beer. You know, like guys like us drink."""
24:58;25:00;"""You got like a Budweiser or a Miller Lite?"""
25:00;25:02;"""Uh, no, we don't have that. Come on, man."""
25:02;25:04;"""We have a Stella Artois and a Peroni."""
25:04;25:08;"""I'm a regular guy like you, man. I don't want no fancy Belgian beer."""
25:08;25:10;"""Just fetch me up a Budweiser back there."""
25:10;25:12;"""Sir, we don't have that. Oh, come on, man. Figure it out."""
25:12;25:18;"And like, the guy's like sweating. He's like, ""Uh, Bradley Cooper just said that we need to get a Budweiser."""
25:18;25:21;"""Okay, okay. Um, run to the corner store."""
25:21;25:24;"And it's like, the guy like comes back. He's like, ""See, man? We're normal guys."""
25:24;25:29;"But then he's like, ""Okay, can I get like a card for the-- you know, like a restaurant card to cover the Bud?"""
25:29;25:34;"And the manager's like, ""No, no, just go. Just pay it for yourself. We'll reimburse you. It'll be in your next check."""
25:34;25:36;"Of course, that doesn't happen."
25:36;25:43;"So then the waiter ends up buying an overpriced six-pack of Bud, never reimbursed."
25:43;25:46;"No tip either."
25:46;25:52;"Oh, hell no. 'Cause it's on some weird company card. The publicist like signs for it, doesn't tip."
25:52;25:56;"New York Times Magazine cover story. Bradley Cooper, man of the people."
25:56;26:00;"Tell me something, girl."
26:00;26:04;"Actually, I'm sorry I said Bradley Cooper."
26:04;26:06;"That's more like a kid rock move."
26:06;26:07;"That was not a B. Coop's move."
26:07;26:08;"No."
26:08;26:09;"He is who he is."
26:09;26:10;"So you're sitting down with these people."
26:10;26:15;"And it was mostly cool, but sometimes I just felt-- at least I had the language now to be clear about it when people would ask me,"
26:15;26:20;"it's like, ""What's this album about?"" And I did say a few times, I was like, ""You know, I'm not always good at explaining what the album's about."""
26:20;26:24;"Like, I have more clarity on the last album now. I could probably describe more."
26:24;26:25;"Sure, sure."
26:25;26:28;"I can look back and say, ""Well, this is the state of mind I was in. I was probably trying to accomplish this."
26:28;26:32;"This album, I can kind of guess about how it's different and stuff."""
26:32;26:36;"And sometimes they ask me about specific songs, and I just feel a little bad, but I'm just like,"
26:36;26:40;"I don't want there to be an article dropping concurrent with the album, let alone weeks before."
26:40;26:41;"Right."
26:41;26:46;"Where it's kind of just like breaking down songs people haven't heard and then they hear it with-- and I don't even always know the answer."
26:46;26:49;"So then what do you say? You're like, ""I don't know, man. Can we, you know?"""
26:49;26:55;"Well, sometimes people be specifically like, ""Is it about this?"" And I'll just be kind of like, ""It's not not about that."""
26:55;27:02;"I just-- so sometimes I just be very straightforward and say, like, ""I did have something specific in mind, but I don't want to overly contextualize it."""
27:02;27:08;"And I said, ""Listen, for better or for worse, I don't like to contextualize stuff before the fans hear it."""
27:08;27:13;"There might be times where that's cool because it leaves the song open and people can approach it."
27:13;27:17;"There might be times where a song might have benefited from some contextualization."
27:17;27:20;"I don't know. Those are just the rules that I play by."
27:20;27:21;"Pretty gym of you, dude."

28:27;28:28;"Okay, let's get into it."
28:28;28:32;"I guess now that the song's been out for a few days, I can contextualize them at least a little bit."
28:32;28:34;"So I guess kind of like the A-side..."

39:55;39:56;"but the song's already out, so..."
39:56;39:57;"It's different."
39:57;39:59;"It's almost like, as I get older--"
39:59;40:00;"and, you know, like, early Van Perrogen,"
40:00;40:01;"""Loxford Common Man's Journey."""
40:01;40:03;"If there's, like, a line like that where I'm like--"
40:03;40:06;"that is, like, a truly good line to me."
40:06;40:08;"It doesn't have any expensive words or anything."
40:08;40:09;"Yeah."
40:09;40:10;"And it's like-- it doesn't take itself too seriously,"
40:10;40:12;"and it's, like, a little funny."
40:12;40:13;"That's kind of like a country lyric, too."
40:13;40:14;"Oh, for sure."
40:14;40:17;"♪ Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain ♪"
40:17;40:20;"♪ I just thought it didn't rain in California ♪"
40:20;40:21;"Yeah."
40:21;40:22;"That kind of vibe."
40:22;40:25;"I can picture Merle Haggard or George Jones singing that."
40:25;40:26;"And also, in terms of--"
40:26;40:28;"obviously, there's some songs on the album"
40:28;40:30;"where I did apply my stringent logic to it,"
40:30;40:32;"and I was like, the song is about somebody"
40:32;40:34;"who's, like, kind of like a dope"
40:34;40:35;"and finally hits a moment in life"
40:35;40:38;"where they realize they got to look through their whole life."
40:38;40:40;"And it's not just about, you know, that tit for tat--"
40:40;40:42;"you've been cheating on me, I've been cheating on you."
40:42;40:44;"It's like maybe I've been cheating through my whole life."
40:44;40:47;"So I like the-- like, opening the song with the vibe of just--"
40:47;40:50;"yeah, I know that everybody goes through pain in life."
40:50;40:51;"It's as natural as the rain,"
40:51;40:53;"but I didn't think it would happen to me."
40:53;40:54;"I live here in California."

41:33;41:34;"No."
41:34;41:36;"So it's just something about ""I was told"""
41:36;41:40;"that really also fit, like, my vision of the narrator of the song."
41:40;41:43;"Well, it's--yeah, it seems like he has received wisdom"

42:02;42:04;"I think that's a very strong lick."
42:04;42:05;"Actually, this song in rehearsal"

42:08;42:09;"That's cool."
42:09;42:10;"Yeah."
42:10;42:11;"And then I wonder if you remember the other one."
42:11;42:12;"I definitely--"
42:12;42:13;"Yeah, I'm curious."
42:13;42:15;"Like, I haven't-- 'cause it's 18 songs on the record?"
42:15;42:16;"Yeah."
42:16;42:18;"I have not heard 18 songs."
42:18;42:19;"I mean, I've heard maybe 10."
42:19;42:20;"Well, we're gonna get into it."
42:20;42:21;"All right."
42:21;42:22;"We're gonna pre-record our--"
42:22;42:23;"Right."
42:23;42:24;"--album time capsule episode."
42:24;42:25;"I'm really excited for that episode."
42:25;42:27;"So I think the basic idea just for the TC Eds"
42:27;42:30;"is obviously me and Jake got a lot of pre-recording to do"
42:30;42:31;"over the next month."
42:31;42:33;"Gonna bank a lot of Eps."

42:42;42:43;"That's true."
42:43;42:44;"--weighted by."
42:44;42:45;"We're gonna be looking at, like,"
42:45;42:47;"maybe a six- to eight-hour work month."
42:47;42:49;"Next time I do an interview and somebody says,"

43:12;43:14;"Yeah, so anyway, just so the TC Eds know,"
43:14;43:17;"the idea is that the weekend the album comes out--"
43:17;43:19;"The album comes out May 3rd, which is a Friday,"
43:19;43:21;"so then there's a TC that Sunday."

44:06;44:07;"Yeah, this is--"
44:07;44:08;"Got Jake on guitar,"

48:41;48:43;"and I remember seeing articles that were called,"
48:43;48:46;"like, ""The Unbearable Whiteness of..."""
48:46;48:47;"Right."
48:47;48:48;"""...whatever."""
48:48;48:50;"""Jonathan Safra 4,"" whatever."
48:50;48:52;"Yeah, something like that, which, for anybody who doesn't know,"

49:01;49:02;"this is a response to an article."""
49:02;49:04;"You know, sometimes I just start with, like, a phrase."
49:04;49:05;"Sure, sure."
49:05;49:06;"And it wasn't even ""unbearable whiteness."""
49:06;49:08;"That's obviously very specifically about something."

50:23;50:24;"I feel like there was one journalist who asked me, like,"
50:24;50:25;"""So is this about race?"""
50:25;50:27;"And I was like, ""Well, I think about things besides--"""

50:36;50:39;"I understand that--what you said, that it's, like, a provocative title,"

50:41;50:43;"Yeah, no, it does--when you hear the--"
50:43;50:45;"I don't think it's a provocative lyric."
50:45;50:46;"No."
50:46;50:48;"I mean, I don't know what the hell the song's about."
50:48;50:52;"I like that you kind of traverse--traverse around with, like--"
50:52;50:55;"To me, it's, like, it's about, like, blinding--"
50:55;50:58;"when, like, you catch, like, the sun glaring off, like, a windshield."
50:58;51:00;"It, like, blinds you."
51:00;51:04;"So it's, like, snow, a sheet of paper, like, that's sitting out in the sun."
51:04;51:05;"I mean, I just heard the song."
51:05;51:09;"I don't--I'm not going deep on it, but to me, it's, like, a cool little journey"
51:09;51:12;"through, like, the different permutations of that sensory experience"
51:12;51:15;"of just, like, blinding brightness."
51:15;51:17;"And that could be a metaphor for whatever you want it to be, but--"
51:17;51:21;"Well, it seems like it's tied to a relationship and, like, you're blinded by someone's light"
51:21;51:23;"or you're--I don't know."
51:23;51:24;"I don't know what the hell it's about."
51:24;51:25;"I don't know how much I should say now."
51:25;51:27;"Yeah, it's just one of those things where I was, like--"
51:27;51:29;"and it's not like I talked to any journalists who were, like, offended by it."
51:29;51:31;"It'll be interesting--well, I'm not going to look,"
51:31;51:35;"but I could imagine, like, just somebody being, like--"
51:35;51:37;"just because it literally contains the word ""white,"""

51:41;51:42;"Oh, for sure."
51:42;51:43;"But--"
51:43;51:44;"It's a provocative title."
51:44;51:46;"Why is it provocative?"
51:46;51:47;"Um--"
51:47;51:50;"Well, I guess you could just say it raises a hot-button topic."
51:50;51:51;"Exactly."
51:51;51:56;"The song's not provocative in that it's writing a song that's saying something specific."
51:56;51:57;"No, it's not."
51:57;52:00;"I'm just saying if you see the track listing, that title might stick out."
52:00;52:02;"There'll probably be somebody who gets to work--"
52:02;52:05;"well, maybe somebody even write a tweet without hearing it, I'm sure."
52:05;52:06;"Oh, hell yeah."
52:06;52:07;"That's how it works."
52:07;52:09;"But anyway, anybody who wants to spend some time with the song,"
52:09;52:12;"I'm happy to talk about it eventually."
52:12;52:14;"I just can't even put my finger on it anymore."
52:14;52:17;"When--I just don't know anymore, because I do feel like--"
52:17;52:20;"I don't like the idea of just leaving things sitting forever,"
52:20;52:24;"but I do feel like it's important to let people engage with an album"
52:24;52:26;"before you start breaking everything down."
52:26;52:27;"Yeah."
52:27;52:29;"I have a lot of very specific things I could say about this song."
52:29;52:32;"I don't want to do it in response to anybody, though."
52:32;52:34;"Give it time, dude. Let it breathe."
52:34;52:35;"I'll let it breathe."
52:35;52:36;"Being provocative is cool, man."
52:36;52:38;"Provocative sounds to me like--"
52:38;52:40;"You're just trolling for attention?"
52:40;52:42;"--like Marilyn Manson or something."
52:42;52:43;"I'm just saying when you see the title--"
52:43;52:44;"I understand that."
52:44;52:46;"Like, Sunflower's not provocative."
52:46;52:48;"Harmony Hall's not provocative."
52:48;52:50;"Unbearably White is provocative."
52:50;52:51;"I like the title."
52:51;52:53;"It's good to have a title or two that sticks out."
52:53;52:55;"Well, and also the truth is--"
52:55;52:57;"Should have called it Unbearably Buff."
52:57;53:00;"[laughter]"
53:00;53:04;"The last thing I'll say before we move on is I'd be insane if I said,"
53:04;53:06;"""Really? People heard Unbearably White"
53:06;53:08;"and they want to talk about race or identity?"""
53:08;53:10;"That'd be insane."
53:10;53:13;"I think there's multiple valid interpretations to a song sometimes,"
53:13;53:16;"and I think a really good song sometimes has that flexibility."
53:16;53:19;"But, yeah, I just hope that if people want to interpret it through that lens,"
53:19;53:21;"I think it's totally valid."
53:21;53:22;"I just--"
53:22;53:23;"Yeah, now I'm--"
53:23;53:24;"No, I don't think--"
53:24;53:27;"I mean, like, if you actually listen to this song,"
53:27;53:28;"you don't listen to it and you're like,"
53:28;53:31;"""Well, this was an interesting commentary on race in America in 2019."""
53:31;53:35;"It seems much more personal and poetic and abstract to me."
53:35;53:36;"Well, I guess that's the thing."
53:36;53:38;"It doesn't come up here and there when I've done interviews."
53:38;53:40;"And I finally found the words to say it to somebody"
53:40;53:42;"because there's other songs on the album"
53:42;53:45;"that people really wanted to ask specific questions about"
53:45;53:47;"because they seem to be very personal and specific."
53:47;53:50;"Sometimes people would ask me questions about my own identity and stuff"
53:50;53:52;"and say, like, ""Well, is that factoring to how you wrote this song?"""
53:52;53:54;"And my vibe is always like,"
53:54;53:55;"obviously, I have a--"
53:55;53:57;"My own identity is important to me,"
53:57;54:00;"but then I also have my identity as a songwriter."
54:00;54:02;"You know, the land of song."
54:02;54:04;"It's bigger than any one thing."
54:04;54:07;"So I kind of have this funny feeling where I was trying to put into words"
54:07;54:09;"this one journalist where I said something along the lines of,"
54:09;54:15;"""It's totally valid if somebody wants to look at a songwriter's lyrics,"
54:15;54:17;"mine in particular, through the lens of identity."
54:17;54:19;"I just hope if they look at it through the lens of identity,"
54:19;54:23;"they actually take the time to look at it through my personal identity."""
54:23;54:25;"If you're going to treat it just as a set of lyrics,"
54:25;54:28;"then you might as well just talk in the broad sense about"
54:28;54:31;"what does whiteness refer to in each stanza, more like English."
54:31;54:32;"I guess these are different--"
54:32;54:34;"Actually, as an English major,"
54:34;54:37;"these are different ways that you can interpret anything, right?"
54:37;54:40;"Through the lens of post-modernism, post-colonialism, whatever."
54:40;54:42;"So I kind of feel like if you want to interpret it"
54:42;54:45;"just on the very basis of language, that's one thing,"
54:45;54:47;"almost in an impersonal way."
54:47;54:49;"But I just kind of feel like if you're going to go personal,"
54:49;54:51;"you really got to go personal."
54:51;54:54;"I can just picture with this song, as soon as somebody hears the title,"
54:54;54:57;"and they have some half-baked notion of Vampire Weekend,"
54:57;54:59;"I know that there'll be somebody who will write something and say,"
54:59;55:04;"""This is Ezra of Vampire Weekend being defensive about whiteness,"""
55:04;55:10;"or something, which is the easiest way to villainize the writer of this song."
55:10;55:12;"Because we know right now there's a lot of people"
55:12;55:16;"who are very defensive about being called out about privilege and whiteness,"
55:16;55:19;"and it's a problem. It's a real problem."
55:19;55:21;"I just kind of feel like--I just don't think there's lyrics in this song"
55:21;55:23;"to support that."
55:23;55:26;"If you do want to look at it through the lens of identity,"
55:26;55:28;"I would just get very specific. That's all that I would say."
55:28;55:30;"Born in 1984."
55:30;55:33;"You got to start there, 1984."
55:33;55:36;"You got to listen to at least 50 hours of TC."
55:36;55:38;"Oh, big time."
55:38;55:41;"Yeah, maybe in two weeks we'll go a little bit deeper."
55:41;55:47;"Skip the light fandango"
55:47;55:53;"Turned cartwheels across the floor"
55:53;56:00;"I was feeling kind of seasick"
56:00;56:06;"The crowd called out for more"
56:06;56:12;"The room was humming harder"
56:12;56:18;"As the ceiling flew away"
56:18;56:25;"When we called out for another drink"
56:25;56:29;"The wager brought a trade"
56:29;56:38;"And so it was later"
56:38;56:45;"As the military's chair"
56:45;56:50;"Let her face at first just go steep"
56:50;56:56;"Turned the wider shade of pale"
56:56;57:23;"guitar solo"
57:23;57:30;"She said there is no reason"
57:30;57:36;"And the truth is plain to see"
57:36;57:43;"But I wandered through my playing cards"
57:43;57:49;"Would not let her be"
57:49;57:56;"One of 16 festal virgins"
57:56;58:02;"Leaving for the coast"
58:02;58:08;"I know though my eyes were open"
58:08;58:12;"They might just as well be closed"
58:12;58:21;"And so it was later"
58:21;58:28;"As the military's chair"
58:28;58:33;"Let her face at first just go steep"
58:33;58:38;"Turned the wider shade of pale"
58:38;58:45;"guitar solo"
58:45;58:48;"A lot of festival lineups are coming out now."
58:48;58:50;"It's festival season."
58:50;58:51;"Festival season's approaching."
58:51;58:55;"So this is a time crisis guide to how to beat the heat."
58:55;58:59;"Jake's gonna go through all the hot fashions for festival season 2019."
58:59;59:02;"We'll walk you through it."
59:02;59:05;"Starting with Coachella."
59:05;59:08;"We're gonna have the TC tent out there."
59:08;59:10;"Selling merch."
59:10;59:12;"Jake's got everything you need."
59:12;59:14;"Stay hydrated, folks."
59:14;59:17;"We're recording live at Jake's libation station"
59:17;59:19;"at Coachella 2019."
59:19;59:25;"That means, like, I don't even know it's considered Coachella fashion anymore."
59:25;59:29;"I'm still probably stuck on like some early Vampire Weekend days like 2008."
59:29;59:31;"Jake in like a neon tank top."
59:31;59:32;"What's up, guys?"
59:32;59:33;"Brutal."
59:33;59:34;"It's festival season."
59:34;59:36;"We're not doing that many festivals this year."
59:36;59:37;"Or maybe we are."
59:37;59:40;"What's the first one on the agenda?"
59:40;59:43;"Not to put anybody on blast, but we politely declined a couple."
59:43;59:45;"Didn't quite feel right this year."
59:45;59:46;"Money was not right."
59:46;59:48;"You know, it wasn't always about the money."
59:48;59:50;"I can't go into detail."
59:50;59:51;"I would love you to go into detail."
59:51;59:53;"Oh, God, I would love to go into detail, too."
59:53;59:54;"What, like the other artists?"
59:54;59:55;"You're like, ""These bands suck."""
59:55;59:56;"Oh, no, who cares about that?"
59:56;59:57;"No, I'm kidding."
59:57;59:59;"And you know how I love everything."
59:59;01:00:00;"Yeah, you love everything."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"What band would suck?"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Imagine Dragons and the 1975."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You're like, ""Oh, I love it. Let's do it."""
01:00:06;01:00:11;"I would bring them out on stage, grab their hands, and be like, ""Guys, come on."""
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yeah."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"We're all in this together."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Artist solidarity."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"There's sometimes shenanigans that go beyond money."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"Sometimes the money's too good, if you know what I mean."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Weird corporate stuff?"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"Sell a piece of your soul."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"Or just like the way the games people play."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"And I'll be honest, like, you know, we're going to roll up to these festivals."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"We're going to put on a damn good show."
01:00:31;01:00:36;"But I've been so focused on the headline show that I want to be like leaving it all out on the field."
01:00:36;01:00:39;"Playing two hours in Islington at 10 a.m."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"That makes me feel like I'm doing something with my life."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"That's strong."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"65-minute set."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"You know, that's fun, but it's different."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"Oh, dude, I relate to that completely."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"We're playing for TC Heads."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Oh, right."
01:00:52;01:00:56;"Richard Pictures is playing the Skull and Roses Festival April 5th."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I guess that already happened."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"At 3:30 in the afternoon, we're playing an hour."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Whoa."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"That's not how we roll."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"A night for us, the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Spreading two sets."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Yeah, we're playing three hours."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"We're playing two 90-minute sets."
01:01:12;01:01:18;"Obviously thrilled to get, you know, to play the 45-minute, hour-long set in front of Vampire."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Oh, right."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"That's kind of a different story."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"That's a whole other can of worms."
01:01:51;01:01:56;"Take a whole pail of water, just to cool it down."
01:01:56;01:02:02;"Fire, fire on the mountain."
01:02:08;01:02:14;"Fire, well, fire on the mountain."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"Fire, fire on the mountain."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"Even as a fan, like, I remember, like, my favorite bands would be playing at a festival."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"And I'd be like, ""Oh, well, they're playing an hour."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"Like, who cares?"""
01:02:25;01:02:26;"Well, I'm of two minds about it."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"I mean, back in the day, when we'd play a festival and I would see that we only had to play for 45 minutes,"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"I'd be like, ""Thank God."""
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Because I wasn't always in the mood to play for a long time."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"And also, I'd feel like, ""Good."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"Nothing but the hits."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"We'll hit them here and there."""
01:02:40;01:02:44;"But now, maybe that I'm older and I've experienced, I will see, and I still am,"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I used to be constantly stressed about my voice."
01:02:46;01:02:53;"I think, you know, knock on wood, I'm developing better techniques because it's important."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"I want to play some long shows."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"And I made it through."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"I held it down two hours in the morning."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"And I felt great after that show."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"I was like, ""Wow, I did this."""
01:03:00;01:03:01;"That's tight."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Because I woke up that morning being like, ""I just did two shows in a row."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Like, I'm about to sing this morning."""
01:03:05;01:03:08;"Went down to the hotel gym, 10 minutes on the tread."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Yeah, and you're singing every song."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Just about."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"That's crazy."
01:03:12;01:03:16;"You know, last summer we dropped a few Sister of Pearls, Baejo joint."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Right, right."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"And we'll do that again in the future."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"But at least I'm going to be singing the majority of it."
01:03:21;01:03:25;"Some of these longer instrumental breaks, I really can relax though."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"That feels good."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"Didn't always have that in the past."
01:03:27;01:03:32;"But after we made it past the two-hour barrier, I've been kind of feeling like, ""Yeah."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I want to see how far we can take this."""
01:03:34;01:03:37;"But back in the day at a festival, I'd be like, ""Okay, 45 minutes."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"I can get through that easy."""
01:03:39;01:03:41;"I was maybe just more nervous about everything."
01:03:41;01:03:48;"But there is a tipping point in a concert sometimes where you make it through the middle section."
01:03:48;01:03:51;"And then it's kind of like, I don't know, it's like you build some kind of solidarity."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"You're just kind of like, ""Now we're really in this together."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"We're here."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"We made it this far."""
01:03:55;01:04:00;"But anyway, are you guys kicking off the entire Grateful Dead festival?"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"I just want to make sure we explain this properly to people who don't know."
01:04:04;01:04:09;"As I understand it, this is a festival that's about Grateful Dead cover bands and kind of"
01:04:09;01:04:13;"Dead adjacent, like Otil Burbridge is the headliner who plays the dead and co."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Does he play in Dead and Co.?"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Yeah, he's the bass player."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Yeah, he's the bassist."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Yeah, I guess he's headlining the fest."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"I don't know if he's playing dead stuff or original material."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"He's got to do some dead stuff."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"I'm sure."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"Remember, he sang ""Fire in the Mountain"" when we saw him."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"That was sick, actually."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"Yeah, he's great."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Not going to see him, unfortunately."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"I think we're just going to be there Friday night."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"We're playing at 3.30 in the afternoon on Friday."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"You might be the first band of the whole fest."
01:04:36;01:04:39;"Well, how do you make yourself stand out?"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"We've been talking about this with our set list."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"Has anybody been like, ""Guys, listen."
01:04:44;01:04:49;"We're one of LA's most beloved Grateful Dead cover bands, but we're going to the big leagues"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"now."
01:04:50;01:04:54;"We're going to a whole festival where you got the best of the best coming from all around"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"the world to perform the music of Jerry and the gang."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"We only got 60 minutes, 3.30 in the afternoon."""
01:05:00;01:05:03;"And then somebody's like, ""Well, let's just pick a lot of great songs."""
01:05:03;01:05:05;"You're like, ""Everybody's going to be picking great songs."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"It's the Grateful Dead festival, man."""
01:05:06;01:05:09;"This is exactly the conversations we've been having at practice."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"Here's what I would say if I was in Richard Pictures."
01:05:11;01:05:15;"Somebody's like, ""Let's just make sure that we come out and we hit them with a scar fire,"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"and then we go straight into a China rider."""
01:05:17;01:05:18;"We're not doing any of that."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"Did anybody just say, ""We got one hour."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"We got to make this shit count."""
