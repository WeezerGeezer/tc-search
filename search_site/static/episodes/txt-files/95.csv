09:59;10:05;"okay so back to Zeb while I was listening to the song my favorite of the"
10:05;10:09;"new singles by the way thank you Zeb I think that's an all-time VW myself I"
10:09;10:14;"became curious about the etymology of the term while my degree is in biology"
10:14;10:20;"and chemistry class of 2017 a buff tight 8 if there ever was one tight 8 do you"
10:20;10:26;"not remember tight 8 no what's that that came from TC man oh okay so clearly this"
10:26;10:30;"is the linguistics episode tight 8 is a phrase that has its origin on the"
10:30;10:36;"American Internet radio show time crisis I believe we were talking about that a"
10:36;10:40;"tight 8 is when you're four years of high school and you're four years of"
10:40;10:44;"college although we didn't want to be elitist so I think we almost said it"
10:44;10:50;"could also just count whatever age 14 to 22 but those eight years of like early"
10:50;10:55;"adulthood into it whatever you want to call that transition teen dude teenage"
10:55;10:59;"years teenage years well no because then you get your early 20s to you know your"
10:59;11:04;"mm-hmm your high school years into your 14 to 22 is a hell of a yeah jump that's"
11:04;11:08;"a big one but those incredibly transformative eight years we were"
11:08;11:14;"saying that if you are blessed to have all eight of those years in the same"
11:14;11:19;"decade you my friend had a tight 8 oh okay talked about it because Jake you"
11:19;11:27;"had a tight 8 and I did not 91 to 99 I mean yeah you're just like king of the"
11:27;11:32;"90s yeah dude just high school into college all 90s hell yeah dude"
11:32;11:38;"whereas mines random as hell I entered high school 98 and exited 2006 you"
11:38;11:43;"entered in and left in different worlds from Clinton to Bush yeah it was all"
11:43;11:47;"over 9/11 dude I think maybe when we had that conversation about the tight it I"
11:47;11:51;"was saying like I was kind of glad I went to high school and college in such"
11:51;11:55;"a random time because I was you know like I just like checked out yeah well"
11:55;11:58;"actually I guess you could answer that question because we're exactly eight"
11:58;12:03;"years in apart seven I think well what year were you 77 over seven yeah right"
12:03;12:10;"cuz now days between the days between our 1977 to 84 the only years when Jake"
12:10;12:14;"and I were not on the planet together that's TC cannon there'll be another"
12:14;12:18;"that's TC can in the days between there's I'm sad to say there's gonna be"
12:18;12:25;"a second days between yeah the years in between our deaths oh my god unless we"
12:25;12:29;"die together I'll be kind of beautiful in a weird way yeah and they're"
12:29;12:33;"officially is only one days between the TC camping trip goes off the rails"
12:33;12:37;"god they never came back man I was up in the middle of the night last night I"
12:37;12:42;"felt the earthquake oh really yeah there was an earthquake last night I was not"
12:42;12:45;"aware I don't think it would have woken me up if I wasn't already awake but I"
12:45;12:48;"was kind of staring at the ceiling and then I just felt like the house like"
12:48;12:52;"lurch damn I was like whoa is that like the house settling or did something fall"
12:52;12:55;"on the roof and then I was like oh yeah I forgot I'm in LA see sometimes I get"
12:55;12:59;"stressed about that because all like the real Angelino's that I know they have"
12:59;13:02;"these traumatic memories of the Northridge earthquake and they they"
13:02;13:06;"remember stuff from school and like you know well they used to tell us we should"
13:06;13:08;"go in the doorframe but now they say go and look you whatever all this stuff and"
13:08;13:12;"I was just like realized like I don't know the basics in the same way it's"
13:12;13:15;"hard for me to imagine what would happen anyways I wake up in the middle of the"
13:15;13:19;"night I hear the house lurch broadly grab my phone and I look at Twitter and"
13:19;13:23;"search earthquake Cardi B happened to be up in LA so she tweeted about it very"
13:23;13:28;"cool and then I see somebody tweet about some kind of like weird earthquake"
13:28;13:31;"predictor guy and they were all freaked out because he's been predicting a big"
13:31;13:35;"one right around now and most scientists would say you can't predict earthquakes"
13:35;13:39;"and this is a dude who's like I swear you can and so some people are into him"
13:39;13:44;"imagine if between the today's taping and when this airs that there's a giant"
13:44;13:48;"earthquake and we died on the same time well at least we reminded people about"
13:48;13:52;"the days between back to the email this is gonna take like an hour and a half to"
13:52;13:55;"get through this email that's what we're banking the EPS yeah I was fortunate"
13:55;13:58;"enough to take a few linguistics courses at school and I've been fascinated by"
13:58;14:02;"the subject ever since an exhaustive 90-second Google search left me with no"
14:02;14:09;"recorded definition of buff adjective that fit its usage on TC UW unbearably"
14:09;14:12;"white or my own conversations I therefore have to speculate on the"
14:12;14:16;"etymology because you're hitting up Kyle we're just trying to establish the chain"
14:16;14:20;"of who told who that doesn't really help with the etymology my first hypothesis"
14:20;14:25;"for the etymology of buff is that it is a portmanteau of brutal and rough that's"
14:25;14:28;"crossed my mind actually too because when I was writing unbearably white"
14:28;14:31;"there's a part of me that's like you know this song it's like a fairly"
14:31;14:36;"serious song does the word buff take people too much out of it and I was like"
14:36;14:41;"I like that mix of tones but of course I thought it'd be very easy to say"
14:41;14:45;"unbearably rough or unbearably tough I was like those would go down a lot"
14:45;14:48;"easier nobody and I was like no buff just sounds better it's cool so rough"
14:48;14:52;"crossed my mind I was like oh yeah rough tough and buff all rhyme that can't be a"
14:52;14:56;"coincidence so could it be a portmanteau of brutal and rough and for people who"
14:56;14:58;"don't know although I think it's probably pretty obvious a portmanteau is"
14:58;15:02;"a word that combines a couple what are some of the classic port I mean the word"
15:02;15:06;"portmanteau is a portmanteau in French Seinfeld what are some classic portmanteaus"
15:06;15:11;"oh man off the top of my head I'm not sure but let me crunch those numbers"
15:11;15:15;"number here I think this is my first number crunch it's coming back good to"
15:15;15:20;"have you back thank you banking the eps and crunching the numbs"
15:20;15:22;"Oh"
15:22;15:24;"go to bed again"
15:28;15:30;"when I get up"
15:30;15:32;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
15:32;15:34;"go to bed again"
15:38;15:40;"I could watch some TV"
15:40;15:42;"maybe"
15:42;15:44;"I could go under my covers and hide"
15:44;15:46;"out the window"
15:46;15:48;"and I could"
15:48;15:50;"go to bed again"
15:50;15:52;"out the window"
15:52;15:54;"bluebirds singing"
15:54;15:56;"those bluebirds"
15:56;15:58;"ain't on my"
15:58;16:00;"side"
16:00;16:02;"when I get up"
16:02;16:04;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
16:04;16:06;"go to bed again"
16:10;16:12;"when I get up"
16:12;16:14;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
16:14;16:16;"go to bed again"
16:22;16:24;"if I go back"
16:24;16:26;"to my"
16:26;16:28;"dreamland"
16:28;16:30;"you might be"
16:30;16:32;"waiting for me"
16:32;16:34;"that's where"
16:34;16:36;"I know I'm"
16:36;16:38;"wanted"
16:38;16:40;"that's where I"
16:40;16:42;"want to be"
16:42;16:44;"guitar solo"
16:46;16:48;"oh"
16:48;16:50;"guitar solo"
16:58;17:00;"when I get up"
17:00;17:02;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:02;17:04;"go to bed again"
17:06;17:08;"guitar solo"
17:08;17:10;"when I get up"
17:10;17:12;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:12;17:14;"go to bed again"
17:16;17:18;"when I get up"
17:18;17:20;"all I wanna do is go to bed again"
17:20;17:22;"go to bed again"
17:28;17:30;"alright, oh"
17:30;17:32;"classic one from pop culture, Brangelina"
17:32;17:34;"oh yeah, so all those couple names"
17:34;17:36;"oh sure, yeah, Glamping"
17:36;17:38;"Glamour and Camping"
17:38;17:40;"Mansplaining"
17:40;17:42;"ok, I've seen people get into"
17:42;17:44;"I'm about to mansplain that to you"
17:44;17:46;"fellas, no we're, ok"
17:46;17:48;"I'm mansplaining to you"
17:48;17:50;"I have also seen people like question if it's"
17:50;17:52;"a true portmanteau if one of the words"
17:52;17:54;"is entirely contained within"
17:54;17:56;"cause like the thing about glamping"
17:56;17:58;"is that you don't get the whole part of"
17:58;18:00;"glamour and you don't get the whole camping, whereas with"
18:00;18:02;"mansplaining you get the whole man"
18:02;18:04;"I don't know what the definition is"
18:04;18:06;"it's kind of maybe just like a less"
18:06;18:08;"smooth portmanteau, it's like an imperfect rhyme"
18:08;18:10;"well mansplaining is weird cause it's a noun and a verb"
18:10;18:12;"it doesn't quite, Brangelina"
18:12;18:14;"has Brad in it, no no"
18:14;18:16;"it's Brangelina, well Angelina"
18:16;18:18;"oh yeah you're right, it has Angelina in it"
18:18;18:20;"ok, Brangelina, we're throwing that one out"
18:20;18:22;"Glamping is a good one, keep going"
18:22;18:24;"what are some like real pure ones, Mockumentary"
18:24;18:26;"we got Mock in here, we got Mock"
18:26;18:28;"Metrosexual, you got"
18:28;18:30;"both, no cause that's metropolitan"
18:30;18:32;"I think I lost the plot here, I don't know what the distinction"
18:32;18:34;"is here, whatever, what are we"
18:34;18:36;"losing or retaining?"
18:36;18:38;"part"
18:38;18:40;"there's no complete word, it's"
18:40;18:42;"a true, one part of one word"
18:42;18:44;"it's a true mix em up, one part of the other word"
18:44;18:46;"combined it's a new word"
18:46;18:48;"you know what the classic American one is, it's very LA"
18:48;18:50;"Smog, Fog and what's"
18:50;18:52;"Smog, Smoke"
18:52;18:54;"oh Smoke, Spork"
18:54;18:56;"Spoon and Fork"
18:56;18:58;"Smog's good, Smog is a good one"
18:58;19:00;"Smog is a"
19:00;19:02;"small frog, you could have a lot of fun with"
19:02;19:04;"that too, that'd be an imaginative"
19:04;19:06;"game to maybe play in a car ride"
19:06;19:08;"making up fake backstories for"
19:08;19:10;"portmanteaus, get it trending"
19:10;19:12;"used to run down to the creek with my little brother"
19:12;19:14;"and catch smogs, something like that"
19:14;19:16;"let me, I want to get a couple more portmanteaus"
19:16;19:18;"Workaholic, I was loving"
19:18;19:20;"these portmanteaus, Work and"
19:20;19:22;"Alcoholic, ok, Shopaholic"
19:22;19:24;"I guess that's like Workaholic but with"
19:24;19:26;"Spanglish, that's a true portmanteau"
19:26;19:28;"Spanish and English"
19:28;19:30;"you know also I think if we talked"
19:30;19:32;"about this on the show, in LA there's a lot of"
19:32;19:34;"portmanteaus of intersections"
19:34;19:36;"like the Wiltern Theater's at the"
19:36;19:38;"corner of Wilshire and Western"
19:38;19:40;"what else? you know there's like a Whole Foods in"
19:40;19:42;"West Hollywood, that's at the corner of"
19:42;19:44;"Santa Monica and Fairfax and that shopping"
19:44;19:46;"plaza is called Sanfair"
19:46;19:48;"not as smooth as Wiltern"
19:48;19:50;"right, oh here's one that you don't realize is a portmanteau"
19:50;19:52;"Bionic, Biology"
19:52;19:54;"and uh, Electronic"
19:54;19:56;"oh you know we forgot the most obvious"
19:56;19:58;"one of all, man, I'm disappointed in us"
19:58;20:00;"yeah? Brunch"
20:00;20:02;"oh dude, that is"
20:02;20:04;"the truest portmanteau, I think the two"
20:04;20:06;"I do think the two all time classics are"
20:06;20:08;"Brunch and Smog"
20:08;20:10;"they're concise, oh here's one we don't even"
20:10;20:12;"remember, if you listen to portmanteau"
20:12;20:14;"talk, presented by Time Crisis"
20:14;20:16;"new podcast, new podcast"
20:16;20:18;"sometimes there's these old ones that we don't even"
20:18;20:20;"know are portmanteaus"
20:20;20:22;"because they were so purely, they became"
20:22;20:24;"such a thing, how about this one"
20:24;20:26;"you ready for this? you guys sitting down"
20:26;20:28;"glitz"
20:28;20:32;"ritz? glamour and"
20:32;20:34;"ritz, you know, putting on the ritz"
20:34;20:36;"but there's also glitz and glamour"
20:36;20:38;"so it's kind of redundant, well it's like"
20:38;20:40;"ATM machine, the"
20:40;20:42;"world has a very short memory, Seinfeld"
20:42;20:44;"PDF format, do you ever"

20:46;20:48;"well the F is format"
20:48;20:50;"yeah, because people always get mad if people"
20:50;20:52;"say ATM machine, because they're like the M stands"

21:32;21:34;"this is what happens when you're banking the Epps"
21:34;21:36;"they say a man can lose his mind when he banks"

22:38;22:40;"here's one that'll be good for that Apple alike"
22:40;22:42;"that I bet you ass***"
22:42;22:44;"never even think about"
22:44;22:46;"internet, woo!"
22:46;22:48;"every day you surf this thing"
22:48;22:50;"and you don't even have the god damn decency"
22:50;22:52;"to recognize that it's a portmanteau"
22:52;22:54;"what does it stand for?"
22:54;22:56;"interconnected"
22:56;22:58;"network, nope"
22:58;23:00;"try again, was either of those words right?"
23:00;23:02;"yes, the network was right"
23:02;23:04;"you're very close, and the funny thing is"
23:04;23:06;"is that I bet some people would actually"
23:06;23:08;"dispute and say that you're right"
23:08;23:10;"in fact, I actually think you probably are right"
23:10;23:12;"this website says it's international network"
23:12;23:14;"ok, kind of a"
23:14;23:16;"name name"
23:16;23:18;"ok, and just because we're having so much"
23:18;23:20;"fun, we're spicing it"
23:20;23:22;"up this week on PC, and because"
23:22;23:24;"we just lost all of our listeners"
23:24;23:26;"we gotta take it back to music, so we'll end with"
23:26;23:28;"a music one, rockabilly"
23:28;23:30;"rock and roll plus hillbilly"
23:30;23:32;"ok, it's a type of popular"
23:32;23:34;"music originating in the southeastern US in the"
23:34;23:36;"1950s combining elements of rock and roll"
23:36;23:38;"and country music"
23:38;23:40;"hillbillies aren't very cool these days, but in the 50s"
23:40;23:42;"even urbane teenagers"
23:42;23:44;"all over, around the world"
23:44;23:46;"from Paris to Munich to New York"
23:46;23:48;"City were interested in hillbillies"
23:48;23:50;"and the type of rock and roll they"
23:50;23:52;"performed. Could buff"
23:52;23:54;"be added to this illustrious"
23:54;23:56;"list? I don't know"
23:56;23:58;"back to the email"
23:58;24:00;"so he wonders if buff"
24:00;24:02;"is an etymology of brutal and rough"
24:02;24:04;"although clearly there's no rules for"
24:04;24:06;"portmanteaus, so there might"
24:06;24:08;"be some people who might suggest the portmanteau"
24:08;24:10;"of brutal and rough would be brough"
24:10;24:12;"that doesn't roll off the tongue"
24:12;24:14;"broughy line at brunch"
24:14;24:16;"brough brah"
24:16;24:18;"this explanation fits for two obvious reasons"
24:18;24:20;"first of all, all three words are used by one Jake Longstreth"
24:20;24:22;"more than anyone else I've ever heard"
24:22;24:24;"you do say brutal and rough"
24:24;24:26;"and second, buff's definition"
24:26;24:28;"seems to fit between rough"
24:28;24:30;"harsh, crude, unfortunate, marked by lack of"
24:30;24:32;"refinement, and brutal, grossly"
24:32;24:34;"ruthless, or unfeeling, harsh, unpleasant"
24:34;24:36;"the middle of that"
24:36;24:38;"Venn diagram in those definitions is harsh"
24:38;24:40;"you say harsh too right?"
24:40;24:42;"absolutely"
24:42;24:44;"however I think there's more to it than that"
24:44;24:46;"buff in the way that Jake and I"
24:46;24:48;"use it has an element of social critique"
24:48;24:50;"while brutal and rough seem to be"
24:50;24:52;"used more to express general negativity"
24:52;24:54;"I guess I should take a minute to posit what"
24:54;24:56;"exactly I think the definition of buff is"
24:56;24:58;"I'm curious what you guys will think"
24:58;25:00;"when something is buffed, it's harsh"
25:00;25:02;"or un-mellow, in a way that makes"
25:02;25:04;"one resent the reality in which such a thing"
25:04;25:06;"can exist. Buffness"
25:06;25:08;"is the dusty August sun baking an"
25:08;25:10;"8 lane road here in downtown Salt Lake"
25:10;25:12;"City. Oh, tighties from Salt Lake"
25:12;25:14;"shout out Salt Lake"
25:14;25:16;"Buffness is a used car lot where the prices are"
25:16;25:18;"written on with that weird crayon"
25:18;25:20;"and the salesman's neon blue button down that came in a"
25:20;25:22;"wrapper. Buffness is DT's"
25:22;25:24;"golden toilet. Oh, Trump"
25:24;25:26;"yep, that's pretty buff"
25:26;25:28;"It's the white stucco on the strip mall subway wall"
25:28;25:30;"in Lake Chambers. A painting by"
25:30;25:32;"Jake Longstreth. Wow"
25:32;25:34;"this guy's deep. Motley Crue"
25:34;25:36;"and the American use of umlauts in general"
25:36;25:38;"classic rock radio ad breaks"
25:38;25:40;"and the great pacific garbage patch"
25:40;25:42;"buff buff buff. Maybe it's just"
25:42;25:44;"because of"
25:44;25:46;"unbearably white, but it seems like things that are buff"
25:46;25:48;"are hard to look at, or in some other way"
25:48;25:50;"difficult to endure. They're almost too real"
25:50;25:52;"and therefore make us uncomfortable"
25:52;25:54;"Buffness lays bare the unfortunate reality"
25:54;25:56;"of the human race, and as Adam"
25:56;25:58;"and Eve covered their newfound nakedness with"
25:58;26:00;"skins, we recoil from buffness"
26:00;26:02;"and try to shield our eyes from it"
26:02;26:04;"This brings me to my second hypothesis"
26:04;26:06;"for the origin of Jake's buff"
26:06;26:08;"It's the unpleasant, unvarnished nakedness"
26:08;26:10;"of reality"
26:10;26:12;"As I've thought about the word buff over the"
26:12;26:14;"past couple of days, the more it comes to perfectly"
26:14;26:16;"exemplify the unfortunate reality"
26:16;26:18;"of American culture in the early 21st"
26:18;26:20;"century. It's a buff world"
26:20;26:22;"we live in. From corporate food twitter"
26:22;26:24;"accounts to for-profit prisons"
26:24;26:26;"from the beige strip malls of my and your"
26:26;26:28;"and all of our hometowns, to the strip"
26:28;26:30;"mining eating away at the mountains across the"
26:30;26:32;"valley. So thanks for giving us a word"
26:32;26:34;"to use for it. Epilogue"
26:34;26:36;"I'd like to leave you with an observation of a rare"
26:36;26:38;"triple alignment of buffness"
26:38;26:40;"As I'm"
26:40;26:42;"sure you're aware, on February 3rd, 2019"
26:42;26:44;"Adam Levine and his rock and roll band"
26:44;26:46;"Maroon 5 performed a halftime show"
26:46;26:48;"at the big game, the Super Bowl"
26:48;26:50;"At a certain point, the rebellious Levine"
26:50;26:52;"decided to remove his shirt, thus displaying"
26:52;26:54;"his buffness in three ways. Number one,"
26:54;26:56;"he was unclothed, or in the buff"
26:56;26:58;"Two, he is surprisingly muscular"
26:58;27:00;"and could reasonably be described"
27:00;27:02;"as buff. And three,"
27:02;27:04;"the grommeted belt, the"
27:04;27:06;"space-filling sailor tattoos, the"
27:06;27:08;"Mormon haircut, the gold cha--"
27:08;27:10;"Mormon haircut? The gold chains,"
27:10;27:12;"the attempt to be cool and rebellious at the center of the"
27:12;27:14;"ultimate orgy of American capitalism"
27:14;27:16;"It was just so buff. Zab's a great"
27:16;27:18;"writer. Yeah, hell of an email. Very"
27:18;27:20;"poetic. And actually, that's"
27:20;27:22;"some real deep analysis, 'cause"
27:22;27:24;"I would've been content to leave it at just brutal"
27:24;27:26;"and rough portmanteau, but I think"
27:26;27:28;"there's something right, that there is"
27:28;27:30;"when buff comes up-- I like"
27:30;27:32;"what you said, yeah, about the sun glaring off"
27:32;27:34;"the hot asphalt"
27:34;27:36;"It's like exposed, it's um"
27:36;27:38;"Well, and also, you know, whether or not"
27:38;27:40;"this is-- his definition's accurate,"
27:40;27:42;"I do like the distinction he's just drawing"
27:42;27:44;"in general about there's moments in life"
27:44;27:46;"and this might not really have to do with the moment"
27:46;27:48;"itself, but more your frame of mind where"
27:48;27:50;"some of the sh*t comes across your desk"
27:50;27:52;"bad situation, and momentarily"
27:52;27:54;"you say, ""Ugh, brutal"
27:54;27:56;"rough, damn, tough break"
27:56;27:58;"something bad happened. This sucks"
27:58;28:00;"this sucks, I'm gonna have to stay"
28:00;28:02;"at work another couple hours"
28:02;28:04;"you know, damn, I'm sorry to hear that."" Whatever"
28:04;28:06;"you hear about something brutal or rough"
28:06;28:08;"the idea that this other word"
28:08;28:10;"could be used to describe something"
28:10;28:12;"that's more about, not just"
28:12;28:14;"a temporary disappointment"
28:14;28:16;"but almost like a"
28:16;28:18;"tear in the veil of"
28:18;28:20;"civilization that lets you see through to the ultimate"
28:20;28:22;"buffness of reality, that's deeper"
28:22;28:24;"and I almost know what he means by that distinction"
28:24;28:26;"one frame of mind, even if you're"
28:26;28:28;"in a bad mood, you're just like, ""Damn, now I"
28:28;28:30;"gotta deal with that, okay."" And then"
28:30;28:32;"other times you're just like, ""Yep"
28:32;28:34;"that's it, the real world"
28:34;28:36;"the real sh*tty world."" Mask"
28:36;28:38;"off. Yep, mask off."
28:38;28:40;"That's buff."
28:40;28:42;"Buff. And I'll tell you, I like that he pointed"
28:42;28:44;"out the three definitions that apply"
28:44;28:46;"to Adam Levine, because"
28:46;28:48;"there is something more interesting"
28:48;28:50;"about the word buff than brutal or rough, 'cause brutal"
28:50;28:52;"or rough, you could use it in the way that you"
28:52;28:54;"use it Jake, but they're also just"
28:54;28:56;"you might use it, have more fun in the way you"
28:56;28:58;"use it, but you're using it accurately the way everybody"
28:58;29:00;"is familiar with the definition, brutal or rough."
29:00;29:02;"Yeah, yeah. The classic is"
29:02;29:04;"this is a buffy trap sitch."
29:04;29:06;"But buff, buff is funny"
29:06;29:08;"because there is this other definition"
29:08;29:10;"that's ostensibly a good thing"
29:10;29:12;"being in good shape. Oh yeah."
29:12;29:14;"And there is something funny too"
29:14;29:16;"that almost makes you picture like"
29:16;29:18;"like a dude who's too jacked"
29:18;29:20;"where you're kind of like, ""Oh yeah, he's in great"
29:20;29:22;"shape. He's buff."" And then you're like"
29:22;29:24;"looking somewhere, he's like, ""He's"
29:24;29:26;"buff."""
29:26;29:28;"And maybe even traffic, like a good thing"
29:28;29:30;"Yeah, something about the state of being"
29:30;29:32;"that like the supposedly good thing that"
29:32;29:34;"turned terrible. Too much of it."
29:34;29:36;"Yeah, like driving in a car, getting"
29:36;29:38;"places faster, the interstate"
29:38;29:40;"highway system, all good things,"
29:40;29:42;"ostensibly, but then at a certain"
29:42;29:44;"turning point, they become buff."
29:44;29:46;"Baby, I love you"
29:46;29:48;"but that's not"
29:48;29:50;"enough"
29:50;29:52;"Pulling away has been"
29:52;29:54;"unbearably bad"
29:54;29:56;"I ran up the mountain"
29:56;29:58;"out of your sight"
29:58;30:00;"Snow on the"
30:00;30:02;"peak was just"
30:02;30:04;"unbearably wet"
30:14;30:16;"The city was"
30:16;30:18;"freezing, you nearly"
30:18;30:20;"can't float"
30:20;30:22;"The wind at the doorway"
30:22;30:24;"was unbearably cold"
30:24;30:26;"You walked"
30:26;30:28;"to the bedroom"
30:28;30:30;"and sat down to write"
30:30;30:32;"The page of your"
30:32;30:34;"notebook was unbearably"
30:34;30:36;"white"
30:36;30:38;"There's an avalanche"
30:38;30:40;"coming"
30:40;30:42;"Don't"
30:42;30:44;"cover your eyes"
30:44;30:48;"It's what you thought that you"
30:48;30:50;"wanted"
30:50;30:54;"It's still a surprise"
30:54;30:58;"It's hot on"
30:58;31:00;"the body"
31:00;31:04;"It's hot on the mind"
31:04;31:08;"To learn we kept us"
31:08;31:10;"together, darling"
31:10;31:12;"It's what"
31:12;31:14;"kept us alive"
31:14;31:38;"Sooner or later"
31:38;31:40;"the story gets told"
31:40;31:42;"To tell it myself"
31:42;31:44;"would be unbearably bold"
31:44;31:48;"Presented with darkness"
31:48;31:50;"we turn to the light"
31:50;31:52;"Could have been smart"
31:52;31:54;"we're just unbearably bright"
32:06;32:08;"There's an avalanche"
32:08;32:10;"coming"
32:10;32:14;"Don't cover your eyes"
32:14;32:18;"It's what you thought"
32:18;32:20;"that you wanted"
32:20;32:24;"It's still a surprise"
32:24;32:30;"It's hot on the body"
32:30;32:34;"It's hot on the mind"
32:34;32:36;"To learn we kept us together, darling"
32:36;32:38;"It's what kept us alive"
32:38;33:00;"Call it day"
33:00;33:02;"Call it night"
33:02;33:04;"Callous and cold"
33:04;33:06;"and just unbearably wild"
33:06;33:10;"Call it day"
33:10;33:12;"Call it night"
33:12;33:14;"Callous and cold"
33:14;33:16;"and just unbearably wild"

33:26;33:30;"Baby, I love you"
33:30;33:32;"but that's not enough"
33:32;33:34;"I'm kinda wet"
33:34;33:36;"It's been unbearably wild"
33:36;33:40;"I've got a mountain"
33:40;33:42;"out of sight"
33:42;33:44;"It's not me"

34:20;34:22;"We're not talking about Panda Express"
34:22;34:24;"because uh"
34:24;34:26;"Nor Domino's"
34:26;34:28;"Panda Express was founded by a family of Chinese origin"
34:28;34:30;"If you think that it's a gringo"
34:30;34:32;"Chinese food"
34:32;34:34;"fake chain"
34:34;34:36;"You got another thing coming"
34:36;34:38;"It's not about Panda Express"
34:38;34:40;"It's time for"
34:40;34:42;"Corporate Food History"
34:42;34:44;"Let's talk about it"
34:44;34:46;"*mimics the sound of a robot*"
34:46;34:48;"This email comes from Britton Thomas"
34:48;34:50;"Crisis Crew"
34:50;34:52;"My office holds a monthly interdepartmental"
34:52;34:54;"meeting"
34:54;34:56;"*laughs*"
34:56;34:58;"Very strong start"
34:58;35:00;"Incredible start"
35:00;35:02;"I also love like"
35:02;35:04;"Maybe he says later in the email but also just like"
35:04;35:06;"generic corporate talk"
35:06;35:08;"Do you remember like back in the day"
35:08;35:10;"there was a band from New Jersey"
35:10;35:12;"called Fountains of Wayne? Sure"
35:12;35:14;"I don't know the record very well but I just always remember"
35:14;35:16;"that they had an album that the title was"
35:16;35:18;"Welcome Regional Managers"
35:18;35:20;"Wow"
35:20;35:22;"Is that a sign?"
35:22;35:24;"Can you get a number crunch on that?"
35:24;35:26;"That's very post office space"
35:26;35:28;"Pre the American office, post office space"
35:28;35:30;"And actually I think now that the office"
35:30;35:32;"has become just such a part of the fabric"
35:32;35:34;"of like American culture, people just watch the office"
35:34;35:36;"on Netflix non-stop"
35:36;35:38;"Oh that, no it's called Welcome Interstate Managers"
35:38;35:40;"Some of the jokes on the American office"
35:40;35:42;"now it's almost like cheers"
35:42;35:44;"it's just like everybody knows it"
35:44;35:46;"But when you really think about the fact that"
35:46;35:48;"early days of the office"
35:48;35:50;"the fact that one of the running jokes was about"
35:50;35:52;"whether or not Dwight"
35:52;35:54;"was assistant regional manager"
35:54;35:56;"or assistant to the regional manager"
35:56;35:58;"that was like a great, very modern"
35:58;36:00;"Yeah, that's wild"
36:00;36:02;"that that humor has become so"
36:02;36:04;"yeah, like exactly what you said"
36:04;36:06;"just part of mainstream"
36:06;36:08;"American culture at this point"
36:08;36:10;"It's like cheers, that's wild"
36:10;36:12;"Well it's also interesting with those shows"
36:12;36:14;"I think about, again"
36:14;36:16;"this is a banked up so I don't know when this is airing"
36:16;36:18;"but somewhat recently, Rashid was talking about"
36:18;36:20;"this like Parks and Rec reunion they did"
36:20;36:22;"and it was like"
36:22;36:24;"the first time they had the whole cast together"
36:24;36:26;"Wow"
36:26;36:28;"I think they're all friendly so there's like"
36:28;36:30;"group hangs happening but to like truly have everybody"
36:30;36:32;"Chris Pratt, Rob Lowe, everybody together"
36:32;36:34;"Yeah"
36:34;36:36;"was unusual and I remember she was telling me about"
36:36;36:38;"how they were going to do this and I was like oh that's cool"
36:38;36:40;"I pictured it was going to be like a panel somewhere"
36:40;36:42;"like in Beverly Hills and like"
36:42;36:44;"kind of industry event"
36:44;36:46;"and maybe like a Q&A"
36:46;36:48;"and I guess they had it at the Dolby Theatre"
36:48;36:50;"3,000 screaming fans"
36:50;36:52;"sold out"
36:52;36:54;"and just like some wild sh*t"
36:54;36:56;"and I probably have talked about this on Time Crisis before"
36:56;36:58;"it's interesting sometimes"
36:58;37:00;"as a musician when you meet actors"
37:00;37:02;"who perform in films and"
37:02;37:04;"programs that tens of millions"
37:04;37:06;"of people see and then they'll like come"
37:06;37:08;"to a modest concert"
37:08;37:10;"and they'll be like"
37:10;37:12;"yo that was crazy like when you bring somebody on stage"
37:12;37:14;"cause they look up"
37:14;37:16;"how often are you in front of 3,000 people"
37:16;37:18;"you might be known by infinitely more people"
37:18;37:20;"but you know even compared to like"
37:20;37:22;"some random band's show it's just like damn"
37:22;37:24;"to really stand, even to stand in front of a few hundred people"
37:24;37:26;"it's like whoa, that's intense"
37:26;37:28;"so anyway they had this Parks and Rec event"
37:28;37:30;"you know and I'm like yeah"
37:30;37:32;"you know I wasn't trying to be on some music"
37:32;37:34;"but they're like 3,000? That's decent"
37:34;37:36;"that's decent for LA"
37:36;37:38;"if you guys keep touring maybe you can get to the Greek in a couple years"
37:38;37:40;"no I wasn't like that"
37:40;37:42;"I was like well yeah you know people love that show"
37:42;37:44;"and then she was like but you gotta understand"
37:44;37:46;"the thing is for all of them"
37:46;37:48;"all those people, you know Amy Poehler"
37:48;37:50;"everybody, their memories of making that show"
37:50;37:52;"were like being this"
37:52;37:54;"like not particularly"
37:54;37:56;"critically acclaimed show that was"
37:56;37:58;"always about to be cancelled"
37:58;38:00;"so for them to like see people years after"
38:00;38:02;"people like who feel so"
38:02;38:04;"connected to the show that's some wild sh*t"
38:04;38:06;"and I think the same thing was true for The Office"
38:06;38:08;"those are like two shows that I think in the streaming era"
38:08;38:10;"became like"
38:10;38:12;"almost like friends level or something"
38:12;38:14;"for some people and I was just thinking about it"
38:14;38:16;"I was like you know the first show I ever like binge watched"
38:16;38:18;"on Netflix, it was when we were recording"
38:18;38:20;"Contra and I was really stressed out"
38:20;38:22;"and I just started like coming home and just taking down"
38:22;38:24;"like six episodes of The Office"
38:24;38:26;"so anyway it is interesting that those shows"
38:26;38:28;"could almost be like part of"
38:28;38:30;"you know friends-esque just like part of"
38:30;38:32;"mainstream culture now. They're like the Village Underground"
38:32;38:34;"it's like not everyone saw those shows"
38:34;38:36;"when they first started but everyone that saw"
38:36;38:38;"those shows made their own shows. Started a show."
38:38;38:40;"Yeah."
38:40;38:42;"Sunday morning"
38:42;38:46;"brings the dawn in"
38:46;38:50;"it's just a restless"
38:50;38:52;"feeling"
38:52;38:54;"by my side"
38:56;39:00;"early dawn in"
39:00;39:04;"Sunday morning"
39:04;39:08;"it's just the wasted"
39:08;39:10;"years so"
39:10;39:12;"close behind"
39:12;39:16;"watch out"
39:16;39:18;"the world's behind you"
39:18;39:22;"there's always someone"
39:22;39:24;"around you who will"
39:24;39:26;"call"
39:26;39:28;"it's nothing"
39:28;39:30;"at all"
39:30;39:36;"Sunday morning"
39:36;39:40;"and I'm"
39:40;39:42;"falling"
39:42;39:44;"I've got"
39:44;39:46;"a feeling I"
39:46;39:48;"don't want"
39:48;39:50;"to know"
39:50;39:52;"early"
39:52;39:54;"dawn in"
39:54;39:58;"Sunday morning"
39:58;40:02;"it's all"
40:02;40:04;"the streets you cross"
40:04;40:06;"not so long"
40:06;40:08;"ago"
40:08;40:10;"watch out"
40:10;40:12;"the world's"
40:12;40:14;"behind you"
40:14;40:16;"there's always someone"
40:16;40:18;"around you who will"
40:18;40:20;"call"
40:20;40:22;"it's nothing"
40:22;40:24;"at all"
40:46;40:48;"watch out"
40:48;40:50;"the world's behind you"
40:50;40:52;"there's always someone"
40:52;40:54;"around you who will"
40:54;40:56;"call"
40:56;40:58;"it's nothing"
40:58;41:00;"at all"
41:00;41:06;"Sunday morning"
41:06;41:10;"Sunday morning"
41:10;41:14;"When I think about the humor of The Office"
41:14;41:16;"it is interesting because I think"
41:16;41:18;"sometimes now like I've even seen"
41:18;41:20;"like the occasional like joke"
41:20;41:22;"I guess this is what always happens like the occasional"
41:22;41:24;"like joke on like Instagram"
41:24;41:26;"where somebody refers to like Office as being"
41:26;41:28;"like your average American who"
41:28;41:30;"loves The Office and"
41:30;41:32;"you know goes to Home Depot you know like that"
41:32;41:34;"type and I'm like but it is funny when I think about"
41:34;41:36;"the early humor of The Office the way I always"
41:36;41:38;"interpreted it and maybe it got a little"
41:38;41:40;"more sentimental towards the end and maybe also"
41:40;41:42;"my frame of reference was this is"
41:42;41:44;"the American version of the"
41:44;41:46;"British version the way I always interpreted"
41:46;41:48;"that show is I was like this is a show about"
41:48;41:50;"people living in hell like this is a show"
41:50;41:52;"about the idiocy of"
41:52;41:54;"a corporate environment like"
41:54;41:56;"being forced to spend time together"
41:56;41:58;"you know there's even something about like the romantic"
41:58;42:00;"things between Jim and Pam"
42:00;42:02;"was always like almost like this slight"
42:02;42:04;"very small ray of hope"
42:04;42:06;"in an otherwise like buff environment"
42:06;42:08;"I don't know why that came to mind but that I"
42:08;42:10;"was like that to me was like a classic joke from The Office"
42:10;42:12;"it's Kafka-esque"
42:12;42:14;"to be the assistant regional manager versus"
42:14;42:16;"the assistant you know it's really like some weird"
42:16;42:18;"like existential like"
42:18;42:20;"Soviet drama or something"
42:20;42:22;"and it is funny to think that"
42:22;42:24;"that show could be considered"
42:24;42:26;"like Cheers now to some people where it's like"
42:26;42:28;"and maybe that is what the show became"
42:28;42:30;"this makes me actually want to go rewatch The Office"
42:30;42:32;"because I think I might be like 10 years now since I really"
42:32;42:34;"went deep on it. Yeah it's not wholesome"
42:34;42:36;"the way those 80s sitcoms were"
42:36;42:38;"yeah maybe it got wholesome. It's not affirming"
42:38;42:40;"yeah but I feel like people talk about it as like"
42:40;42:42;"cause the point of Cheers was like hey"
42:42;42:44;"life's tough out there but here we can be together"
42:44;42:46;"yeah. You know this is your home away from"
42:46;42:48;"home. Yeah. And these people they"
42:48;42:50;"might not be your family but it's a type of family"
42:50;42:52;"yeah. That we find here at Cheers"
42:52;42:54;"and uh you can read The Office"
42:54;42:56;"that way I guess if you want but I always thought of it as like"
42:56;42:58;"people living in hell fighting over whether"
42:58;43:00;"you're the assistant regional manager or the assistant"
43:00;43:02;"to the regional manager. It's more brutal"
43:02;43:04;"than you even remember it being"
43:04;43:06;"I've been rewatching it"
43:06;43:08;"for the last two weeks. Something about"
43:08;43:10;"the hindsight of it. I mean it's so"
43:10;43:12;"funny but all of that"
43:12;43:14;"it's hell. Or like the BJ Novak"
43:14;43:16;"character being like the small town"
43:16;43:18;"pretentious f*** who thinks"
43:18;43:20;"he's gonna like get out and like like"
43:20;43:22;"stun on everybody and then he gets like humiliated"
43:22;43:24;"right long term? Yeah we actually watched that episode"
43:24;43:26;"last night. Oh really? Yeah he gets humiliated"
43:26;43:28;"and his punishment is that he has to go back"
43:28;43:30;"and work there. Ugh"
43:30;43:32;"That's his punishment. A lot of people don't know"
43:32;43:34;"this but The Office actually takes place"
43:34;43:36;"literally takes place in hell. I'm not being metaphoric"
43:36;43:38;"not being metaphorical. The Office"
43:38;43:40;"takes place in hell. It's based on"
43:40;43:42;"a play by Jean-Paul"
43:42;43:44;"Sachs"
43:44;43:46;"You know it's funny. It's like when you haven't watched something in a long time"
43:46;43:48;"it's always random jokes that stick"
43:48;43:50;"in your brain. I remember there was a"
43:50;43:52;"one of the jokes about the BJ Novak"
43:52;43:54;"character who's like the kind of ambitious pretentious"
43:54;43:56;"local Scranton guy"
43:56;43:58;"was maybe when he moves to New York"
43:58;44:00;"or something he comes back and he keeps"
44:00;44:02;"talking to somebody about like New York"
44:02;44:04;"Sushi. I don't even remember what the joke"
44:04;44:06;"was but just that he kept talking about New York Sushi"
44:06;44:08;"he's like oh the sushi here is terrible"
44:08;44:10;"New York Sushi it's on another"
44:10;44:12;"level. Yeah it's like they didn't like"
44:12;44:14;"the characters they were"
44:14;44:16;"writing and performing which"
44:16;44:18;"is fine I like that. I like a more cynical view"
44:18;44:20;"in things but the 80's"
44:20;44:22;"sitcoms it's like they were written"
44:22;44:24;"so you would have a... well actually the irony"
44:24;44:26;"is that the 80's ones you"
44:26;44:28;"like they were designed to develop"
44:28;44:30;"affection for the characters and warmth towards"
44:30;44:32;"them. I don't think The Office was designed"
44:32;44:34;"that way but it ended up happening anyway."
44:34;44:36;"And maybe that is the most human thing you could"
44:36;44:38;"present is that life is hell"
44:38;44:40;"but you spend enough time with"
44:40;44:42;"even bad flawed"
44:42;44:44;"people and you will find a degree"
44:44;44:46;"of affection for them because we are all human"
44:46;44:48;"beings living in hell together."
44:48;44:50;"That's a type of pessimism so"
44:50;44:52;"buff that it comes back to optimism."
44:52;44:54;"There's another sitcom that I feel is the"
44:54;44:56;"blueprint for that kind of"
44:56;44:58;"animosity towards its characters."
44:58;45:00;"You're right, Friends. Because Friends"
45:00;45:02;"is the epitome of the 90's"
45:02;45:04;"New York just kind of"
45:04;45:06;"cutting remarks but again"
45:06;45:08;"at the end of the day the title reminded us"
45:08;45:10;"that these people, these"
45:10;45:12;"kind of ironic 90's New Yorkers"
45:12;45:14;"in spite of their differences"
45:14;45:16;"and their kind of edgy sense of humor"
45:16;45:18;"they were in fact friends and I'm"
45:18;45:20;"really glad you brought that up. I'm going back to Japan."
45:20;45:22;"[laughter]"
45:26;45:33;"be this way. Your jobs a joke you brew, your love life the old way,"
45:33;45:41;"it's like you're always stuck in second gear, when it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,"
45:41;45:46;"or even your year but, I'll be there for you."
45:46;45:48;"I'll be there when the rain starts to pour."
45:48;45:50;"I'll be there for you."
45:50;45:53;"You can be where you want to be and you can be whole."
45:53;45:56;"I'll be there for you."
45:56;46:01;"Could you bear for me too?"
46:01;46:03;"Maybe, right? Seinfeld has a degree of that."
46:03;46:04;"Oh, for sure."
46:04;46:10;"There was something about Seinfeld that's like, maybe because nobody ever actually had to work in just like,"
46:10;46:16;"a kind of like, fluorescent lit office. Jerry's on Easy Street all the time, he's even Steven."
46:16;46:16;"Yeah, he's chillin'."
46:16;46:19;"Kramer doesn't actually have to work in kind of, you know."
46:19;46:22;"There's no acknowledgement of like, economic realities in Seinfeld."
46:22;46:25;"Except for George had to move back in with his parents at some point."
46:25;46:25;"Yeah."
46:25;46:28;"But even George, he like, always was randomly getting good jobs too."
46:28;46:30;"Like working for the Yankees."
46:30;46:33;"Yeah, George is like, some classic baby boomer, failing upwards."
46:33;46:34;"Yeah, very 90s."
46:34;46:39;"'Cause you know, that's a distinction people always draw now, is like, when people are hard."
46:39;46:40;"George had a tight eight in the 90s."
46:40;46:41;"I can relate."
46:41;46:46;"That's a classic point people make, when there's boomers are being tough on millennials,"
46:46;46:49;"and they're like, boomers had all sorts of benefits."
46:49;46:52;"The job market was different, you got paid better, blah, blah."
46:52;46:57;"It's hard to imagine a millennial show, where a character like George just doesn't make sense in the millennial era."
46:57;47:00;"Like a guy who's always like, pulling his hair, and ""Ah, I gotta work at the Yankees."""
47:00;47:02;"[Laughter]"
47:02;47:05;"You know, just like, it's just a very different vibe."
47:05;47:06;"Yeah."
47:06;47:09;"Um, anyway, you're listening to TV Talk."
47:09;47:10;"This episode of The Watch."
47:10;47:14;"This is an episode of Time Crisis, colon, Watch."
47:14;47:20;"Where we pick, you know, relatively obscure TV shows like The Office, Seinfeld Friends."
47:20;47:23;"And we do a deep dive, and we hope that after you listen to us, uh,"
47:23;47:26;"jawbone about these shows for a couple hours, maybe you could check them out."
47:26;47:28;"And we tell you where to catch them too."
47:28;47:31;"So for instance, The Office is streaming on Netflix."
47:31;47:33;"I believe Friends is too."
47:33;47:36;"Now Seinfeld, however, that one you're gonna find on Hulu."
47:36;47:41;"You could also catch it weeknights at 11 on your local stations, local Fox usually."
47:41;47:43;"And with all these shows, you can also get the DVDs from the library."
47:54;47:59;"You're listening to Time Crisis on B1."
47:59;48:05;"I bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills"
48:05;48:09;"with a trunk load of a hundred thousand dollar bills."
48:10;48:13;"Man came by to hook up my cable TV."
48:13;48:16;"We settled in for the night, my baby and me."
48:16;48:20;"We switched from round and round till half past dawn."
48:20;48:23;"There was 57 channels and nothing on."
48:23;48:27;"57 channels and nothing on."
48:27;48:31;"57 channels and nothing on."
48:31;48:38;"Well now, home entertainment was my baby's wish."
48:38;48:41;"So I hopped into town for a satellite dish."
48:41;48:45;"I tied it to the top of my Japanese car."
48:45;48:49;"I came home and I pointed out into the stars."
48:49;48:53;"A message came back from the great beyond."
48:53;48:56;"57 channels and nothing on."
48:56;49:00;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:00;49:03;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:07;49:10;"Bill, you might have made some friends with some billionaires."
49:10;49:15;"You might have got on nice and friendly if we made it upstairs."
49:15;49:18;"All I got was a note that said, ""Bye-bye, John."
49:18;49:22;"I love 57 channels and nothing on."""
49:22;49:25;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:25;49:29;"So I bought a '44 Magnum with solid steel cast."
49:29;49:33;"And in the blessed name of Elvis, well, I just let it blast."
49:33;49:37;"Till my TV lay in pieces there at my feet."
49:37;49:40;"And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace."
49:40;49:43;"Judge said, ""What you got on your defense, son?"""
49:43;49:47;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:47;49:51;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:51;49:55;"57 channels and nothing on."
49:55;49:58;"I can see by your eyes, friend, you're just about gone."
49:58;50:02;"57 channels and nothing on."
50:02;50:06;"57 channels and nothing on."
50:06;50:12;"Okay, we've read one half sentence of the email from Britain."
50:12;50:14;"We got eight words into the email."
50:14;50:16;"I don't even know if we said their name, Britain."
50:16;50:16;"Yep."
50:16;50:19;"This is about the ultimate corporate food fraud."
50:19;50:23;"Crisis crew, my office holds a monthly interdepartmental meeting."
50:23;50:27;"And the key selling point is a lukewarm batch of mediocre bagels."
50:27;50:28;"Sold."
50:28;50:31;"These bagels typically come from a run-of-the-mill outfit like Panera,"
50:31;50:35;"Einstein Bros, or I wonder how you say this,"
50:35;50:38;"Brugers, Broigers, Bruggers?"
50:38;50:39;"I know the place."
50:39;50:39;"Brugers."
50:39;50:40;"You think people say Brugers?"
50:40;50:41;"Probably."
50:41;50:43;"This month's meeting is taking place tomorrow."
50:43;50:47;"So I set off on my walk home this evening with bagels in the back of my mind."
50:47;50:48;"Buff."
50:48;50:52;"That is a very heavy novelistic detail."
50:52;50:54;"That's like a modern Kafkaesque novel."
50:54;50:56;"Hmm, bagels tomorrow."
50:56;50:58;"Hope they don't get that blueberry cream cheese."
50:58;51:02;"I was informed by my superior that tomorrow would be the monthly interdepartmental meeting."
51:02;51:04;"As I walked back to my flat,"
51:04;51:11;"I thought about the lukewarm batch of mediocre bagels that would be served."
51:11;51:15;"Generally speaking, at the monthly interdepartmental meeting, bagels are served."
51:15;51:17;"This could be our big Russian novel."
51:17;51:20;"And it's called the monthly interdepartmental meeting."
51:20;51:22;"It's like, uh, wait, what's your boy?"
51:22;51:23;"Nosgard?"
51:23;51:30;"90 page passage on the bagels at the meeting."
51:30;51:35;"The whole novel is 1100 pages, but the walk home is 400."
51:35;51:36;"The walk home is 400."
51:36;51:38;"Okay."
51:38;51:42;"As I do virtually every day, I passed my neighborhood Einstein Bros location."
51:42;51:44;"But today I paused for a moment to check out the sign."
51:44;51:48;"On the sign are two well-dressed cartoon men nestled inside a bagel."
51:48;51:51;"On the left stands a mustachioed man in a bowler hat."
51:51;51:54;"To his right stands a bald man with glasses."
51:54;51:55;"In addition to being inside a bagel,"
51:55;51:59;"each of the men is peeking through a bagel as if it were a monocle."
51:59;52:01;"So this is like one of those, uh, like, you know,"
52:01;52:04;"how many triangles are in the picture type thing?"
52:04;52:05;"Like an MC Escher?"
52:05;52:06;"Maybe."
52:06;52:06;"How many?"
52:06;52:07;"Like a magic guy?"
52:07;52:10;"Or just a, uh, logic game."
52:10;52:11;"I don't know."
52:11;52:13;"How many bagels are in the Einstein Brothers logo?"
52:13;52:14;"The answer may surprise you."
52:14;52:16;"Bagels within bagels within bagels."
52:16;52:18;"I thought to myself, wow, what a logo."
52:18;52:22;"And I began to wonder who were these bagel brothers and how did they get started?"
52:22;52:24;"When I returned home, I immediately began my research."
52:24;52:25;"Nice."
52:25;52:28;"Whatever company Britain works for, they're lucky to have this person."
52:28;52:29;"Yeah. Diligent."
52:29;52:33;"First stop, the locations page on Einsteinbros.com."
52:33;52:36;"After a quick number crunch, thoughts and prayers for Seinfeld."
52:36;52:37;"He's back. He's back."
52:37;52:39;"In parentheses. Okay, he's back."
52:39;52:44;"I learned there are 709 total Einstein's locations in 42 states,"
52:44;52:49;"plus the district of Columbia, including 81 in Texas and a whopping 87 in Florida."
52:49;52:51;"Strong presence in the deep South."
52:51;52:53;"Yeah, that's deep."
52:53;52:55;"Einstein bagels. I'm aware of them."
52:55;52:57;"I see them around LA again."
52:57;52:58;"Never hit it."
52:58;53:00;"Growing up in Jersey, and I imagine the whole tri-state,"
53:00;53:07;"the idea that Sunday morning, mom or dad would go out and bring back a brown paper bag of bagels"
53:07;53:07;"from a chain."
53:07;53:09;"Hell no."
53:09;53:10;"That wasn't happening."
53:10;53:15;"For the most part in the tri-state, you get bagels from a local bagel place."
53:15;53:16;"You also get pizza from a local pizza place."
53:16;53:17;"Big time."
53:17;53:19;"We did do the occasional Domino's stuff."
53:19;53:21;"I'm not going to lie, but you order from, like we've talked about on the show,"
53:21;53:23;"you order from Angelo's, Tony's."
53:23;53:24;"Antonio's."
53:24;53:25;"That was your answer."
53:25;53:26;"Pizza Villa."
53:27;53:29;"[laughter]"
53:29;53:35;"So that is a lot, and the idea that it's so, there's so many in Texas and Florida, surprising."
53:35;53:38;"This is an impressive total for an upstart company founded by two brothers."
53:38;53:40;"A bald one and one with glasses."
53:40;53:42;"I had to learn how it all began."
53:42;53:45;"I expected to find an Our Story page featured prominently on the site,"
53:45;53:48;"hopefully with a few historical photos for good measure."
53:48;53:50;"Unfortunately, that page didn't exist."
53:50;53:53;"Instead, I found a link in the footer titled ""About Us."""
53:53;53:56;"The phrasing for the page seemed impersonal and corporate,"
53:56;53:59;"but I guess that's to be expected with what is now a huge nationwide chain."
53:59;54:02;"Recently, we were having a discussion about Panda Express,"
54:02;54:08;"and what could sound more like a fake thing that, you know, an American corporation would event?"
54:08;54:11;"We want to make a Chinese restaurant that we can just, you know, put in malls."
54:11;54:12;"What do we call it?"
54:12;54:13;"Panda Express."
54:13;54:14;"Perfect."
54:14;54:15;"Done."
54:15;54:18;"But no, that's actually not the story of Panda Express."
54:18;54:20;"But let's see what's going on with Einstein."
54:20;54:21;"This is what the page said."
54:21;54:24;"""Here at Einstein Brothers Bagels, we believe in the bagel."""
54:24;54:25;"Good."
54:25;54:27;"[laughs]"
54:27;54:29;"It would be weird if you didn't."
54:29;54:31;"""We believe it has the power to do amazing things,"
54:31;54:34;"giving you a reason to look forward to morning office meetings."""
54:34;54:35;"Bingo."
54:35;54:38;"Wait, so there's something funny that, like,"
54:38;54:41;"Einstein Brothers and office meetings are like a thing."
54:41;54:45;"They're both in those kind of, like, you know, homogenized corporate landscapes."
54:45;54:49;"That's also like some postmodern Soviet novel, just like, or like,"
54:49;54:54;"you picture in like some dystopia where the state has like a ministry of like..."
54:55;54:56;"Bagels?"
54:56;54:58;"Or like a ministry of like happiness."
54:58;54:59;"Right."
54:59;55:00;"And they're like, you know, like,"
55:00;55:02;"""We need to increase the happiness in the country."""
55:02;55:04;"And they're like, ""One of our initiatives..."""
55:04;55:05;"Increase the bagel ration."
55:05;55:09;"""...is to increase the bagel ration for interdepartmental office meetings."""
55:09;55:12;"And there is something about that."
55:12;55:15;"You know, I actually, Nick, you told me to watch that show Corporate."
55:15;55:15;"I started watching."
55:15;55:17;"It seemed like a good show from what I could tell."
55:17;55:18;"I only watched the first episode."
55:18;55:21;"But there was literally in the first episode something about"
55:21;55:25;"going to a meeting expecting a bagel or a pastry or something."
55:25;55:26;"But there was something about..."
55:26;55:27;"Cake."
55:27;55:31;"But before the cake part, that's why they're so hungry later in the episode is"
55:31;55:34;"they wanted a muffin or a danish or something at the..."
55:34;55:38;"But it was this thing where like the executives get to hit the tray first."
55:38;55:42;"But anyway, clearly I've never worked in a very corporate environment"
55:42;55:45;"or like a corporate office environment, at least."
55:45;55:47;"I have been involved in many corporations."
55:47;55:47;"Currently."
55:47;55:49;"I guess it's almost like school too."
55:49;55:53;"How like at school, it's such a big deal if it's somebody's birthday"
55:53;55:54;"and there's going to be cupcakes."
55:54;55:56;"I've worked in a lot of corporate places."
55:56;55:58;"Bagel Fridays are huge."
55:58;56:00;"And is it off their universal?"
56:00;56:01;"Yeah."
56:01;56:04;"Yeah, I would say Einstein is pretty common."
56:04;56:07;"But my thing is that like, are bagels fun enough?"
56:07;56:10;"You know, you'll go to a place, I guess it throws out some donuts."
56:10;56:12;"Yeah, donuts is fun."
56:12;56:13;"That's fun."
56:13;56:16;"It's mostly you're going to a bagel Friday,"
56:16;56:18;"a couple of different kinds of cream cheeses."
56:19;56:20;"Oh, I guess that's fun."
56:20;56:21;"If you have..."
56:21;56:23;"I know it when at Adult Swim in Atlanta,"
56:23;56:25;"where you really can't get a lot of bagel options."
56:25;56:27;"Certainly not when I was there."
56:27;56:27;"It was Einstein?"
56:27;56:31;"It was Einstein bagels every Friday."
56:31;56:34;"Einstein coffee in the big, you know, square."
56:34;56:36;"How's their coffee?"
56:36;56:37;"Not great."
56:37;56:42;"Grandpa, we had sweet days on a beach in Denver, I remember."
56:42;56:45;"Wish we could walk along and you could watch the waves"
56:45;56:46;"and talk the current September."
56:46;56:49;"These days I'm not so sure who's getting along"
56:49;56:50;"or if they were before."
56:50;56:52;"I wasn't there when Moses was a seed."
56:52;56:55;"I wasn't there with you, Grandpa, back in Kiev."
56:55;56:58;"When the ladies dress up nice in their ornate reds"
56:58;57:00;"and sudden textures."
57:00;57:02;"Have you since found some peace?"
57:02;57:05;"It's like we can't escape all the noise and violence."
57:05;57:07;"These days I'm not so sure who's getting along"
57:07;57:08;"or if they were before."
57:08;57:11;"I wasn't there when Moses was a seed."

58:27;58:30;"to keep the American office population docile."
58:30;58:33;"- I actually feel they were kind of salty, the bagels."
58:33;58:34;"I'm actually gonna look up and see"
58:34;58:36;"if that's part of their recipe."
58:36;58:36;"- Man."
58:36;58:38;"- You could sort of taste the sodium a bit,"
58:38;58:39;"you know what I mean?"
58:39;58:42;"- I mean, I can picture like when I was a teacher,"
58:42;58:44;"you know, it's a hard job just like standing there all day."
58:44;58:45;"It's kind of intense."
58:45;58:48;"And when I occasionally have like a free period,"
58:48;58:49;"this is the only time in my life"
58:49;58:51;"I ever got into non-dairy creamer."
58:51;58:52;"Am I using that correctly?"
58:52;58:54;"There's also, 'cause non-dairy creamer could be a liquid"
58:54;58:56;"or it could just be like the dust."
58:56;58:57;"- Oh yeah, like the packets."
58:57;59:00;"- Or sometimes just the big thing that you just shake in."
59:00;59:00;"What would you call it?"
59:00;59:01;"It's like a powder."
59:01;59:02;"- Yeah."
59:02;59:03;"- Dust."
59:03;59:05;"- It reminds me of like Parm, like at Italian restaurants"
59:05;59:07;"when they have like the big shaker."
59:07;59:08;"- Oh, like the Kraft Parm?"
59:08;59:10;"- Full of Parm."
59:10;59:11;"Shake it on."
59:11;59:12;"- I do like that Parm, I gotta admit."
59:12;59:14;"That's similar to Taco Bell, one of those things"
59:14;59:16;"where I like the good (beep) and I like the bad (beep)"
59:16;59:17;"- Can I read you something"
59:17;59:19;"about how they make Einstein bagels?"
59:19;59:20;"- Yeah."
59:20;59:24;"- The bagel dough, this is brutal, or buff."
59:24;59:25;"I mean, I think it's worse than buff."
59:25;59:27;"- The bagel doughs are mixed and formed"
59:27;59:31;"at a central plant that is contracted"
59:31;59:34;"to make the bagels to Einstein specifications."
59:34;59:36;"The bagels are then frozen to be shipped"
59:36;59:38;"to individual stores, which have walk-in freezers."
59:38;59:40;"- Wait, does that imply that the plant"
59:40;59:41;"is not owned by Einstein?"
59:41;59:43;"- Yeah, that's what it sounds like."
59:43;59:45;"- They're probably making bagels for, you know,"
59:45;59:47;"like Safeway."
59:47;59:48;"- Right."
59:48;59:50;"- Western family brand frozen bagels."
59:50;59:53;"- The People's Central Bagel Factory, number 52."
59:53;59:55;"- United States Bagel Company."
59:55;59:57;"United (laughs)"
59:57;59:59;"Government Bagels."
59:59;01:00:02;"- Einstein Bagels is the 81st largest"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"fast food restaurant chain."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"- That doesn't seem worth mentioning."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- No, it's weird."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"(laughing)"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- We're like on their website."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"I do relate to that, that when you're in kind of like"
01:00:11;01:00:14;"a sterile environment, and I mean, a school is,"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"even with like--"
01:00:16;01:00:16;"- Institutional."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- Institutional, yeah, right, 'cause I wouldn't exactly"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"call a school sterile, quite literally, it's full of germs."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"But in an institutional environment, that was a funny thing"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"where occasionally when I'd have like a free period,"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"just to do something different, just to consume something,"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"felt like a treat."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"- Sure."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"- And I didn't even particularly enjoy it,"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"but because they, in the teacher's lounge,"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"they had always had like a kind of (beep) pot of coffee"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"and they had the non-dairy creamer powder."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"I would just go like ham on the powder,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"just to like do something."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- Damn, dude."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Just to feel something."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"(laughing)"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"So I guess I can relate to the idea of like,"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"you know, at least donuts are like, woo, donuts!"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"But I guess it's kind of like, hey, bagels."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"It's just--"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"- Bagels is like, I'm skipping breakfast this morning"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"'cause I'm gonna crush a bagel at the meeting."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- I guess you save a little money,"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"you don't have to pay for breakfast, that's cool."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- Booyah!"
01:01:04;01:01:07;"- I think there's also the feeling of just kind of like,"

01:12:32;01:12:35;"- Inspired by the cafe culture of 1920s Vienna."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"(laughing)"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"- When the Impressionists put on their first exhibition"
01:12:40;01:12:45;"of paintings in Paris in 1875 at the cafe."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"- The Einstein Brothers were contemporaries"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"of Gustav Klimt and Sigmund Freud."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"However, in the 1930s, dark days loomed ahead."
01:12:53;01:12:57;"The cafe culture they loved in Vienna would change forever"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"with the rise of the Nazi party in Germany."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- Smash cut to Phoenix, Arizona, present day."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"(laughing)"
01:13:04;01:13:08;"- I'd rather go chop it up at a Dunkin' Donuts personally."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- Than an Einstein."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"- I don't care."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"- Dunkin' Donuts is cool because it's like,"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"remember there's that SNL Casey Affleck fake"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Dunkin' Donuts ad?"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"- I don't, I don't."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"- I will save that for another day."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Yeah."
01:13:20;01:13:20;"- Okay."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"- 'Cause there's the Ben Affleck story"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"that we were on that TC thread about, right?"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"- Oh yeah, we heard that Ben Affleck,"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"'cause back in fairly, relatively recently"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"there were no Dunkin' Donuts in LA"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"and now there's a bunch and Ben Affleck,"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"you know, classic Boston boy,"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"he said that he goes to Dunkin' Donuts every day."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"We're trying to determine which one he goes to."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"I don't wanna violate his privacy."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"- Sherman Oaks."
01:13:40;01:13:43;"- Jake thinks Sherman Oaks."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- Studio City."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"- Okay, so Britain's digging deeper on the website."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"At this point I started to get agitated."
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Not only has this company scrubbed the names"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"of the founding brothers from the site,"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"but they were also implying that their bagels,"
01:13:54;01:13:57;"great, are better than the conversation."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"(laughing)"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"This is good."
01:14:02;01:14:06;"They were also implying that their bagels, great,"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"are better than the conversational ability"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"of their customers, merely good."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"And yeah, now if you go back to that footer on the site,"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"Einstein Brothers Bagels,"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"the friendly neighborhood gathering place"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"for good conversation and great food."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Somebody sat there and wrote that and said,"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"""We need to make sure that the food"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"""is better than the conversation."""
01:14:25;01:14:26;"That's some Trump (beep) too."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"Can you picture like Trump's supposed to be like"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"honoring some veterans or something."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"It's like, look at us up here, a great president"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"and some very good veterans all here today."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"The greatest president."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"And a very good."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"Some very capable, competent, good veterans."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"(laughing)"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"So frustrated, I kept digging."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"I took my search to place place."
01:14:49;01:14:52;"Wait, is this a typo or is place place like a word?"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"No, they probably mean, I took my search to the place"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"I should have begun my fact finding operation Wikipedia."
01:14:56;01:15:00;"On the Einstein Wiki page, it gives a founding date, 1995."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"Okay."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Recent."
01:15:03;01:15:07;"An owner, JAB or Jab Holding Company"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"and BDT Capital Partners."
01:15:09;01:15:12;"And a parent company, Einstein Noah Restaurant Group INC."
01:15:12;01:15:16;"Well, that part's not that surprising because as we know,"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"many mom and pop businesses that grow"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"end up getting owned by giant multinational corporations."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"This was starting to sound more corporate"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"than I originally realized."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"I scanned over to the history tab of the Wiki page"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"and my jaw dropped."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"'Cause I was even gonna say,"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"when I see that founding date, 1995,"
01:15:32;01:15:32;"I was gonna like, well, okay,"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"maybe Einstein Brothers Holding Company was founded in '95"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"after, you know."

01:15:41;01:15:42;"I used something like that."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"So anyway, my jaw dropped."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"The first sentence reads,"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Einstein Brothers was created"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"by the chain restaurant corporation, Boston Chicken,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"now Boston Market in '95."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Remember when Boston Market was called Boston Chicken?"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- Yeah."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"- It's 1995."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Boston Market is still called Boston Chicken."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"And I'm still living with my parents"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"in Western Massachusetts."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"This is my story."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"(laughing)"
01:16:06;01:16:10;"- This is the opening of another TC novel."
01:16:10;01:16:15;"- No, or like that could be also a novel about Matt and Ben."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"- Oh yeah, dude."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"- It's 1995."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"- Dude, Matt and Ben fan fiction."
01:16:19;01:16:22;"- Well, like the Sox still hadn't won a World Series in '95"
01:16:22;01:16:23;"for."

01:17:36;01:17:38;"The Einstein Brothers don't exist."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"(explosion)"
01:17:41;01:17:42;"This is not the story of two brothers"
01:17:42;01:17:43;"who against all odds,"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"hustled their way to create an expansive bagel empire."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"Einstein Brothers is the story of a chain,"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"created by another chain,"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"not to bake and serve bagels,"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"but to market breakfast foods."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"Now I'm a fairly cynical guy"

01:18:04;01:18:05;"Oh, we know that from the founder."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"- Oh yeah."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"- Shout out to Ray Kroc, villain."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"- Shout out to Ray Kroc."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"- The owners of the mom and pop store in Seinfeld"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"weren't an actual mom and pop,"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"but at least those stories involve real people."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"Well, except the Seinfeld one, but you get what I mean."
01:18:19;01:18:22;"I was and remain gobsmacked by this Einstein revelation."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"I mean, it's one thing to concoct a fake name,"
01:18:24;01:18:28;"sub-haggandaz, but fake founders, that's pushing it."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"And it's even more disturbing"

01:18:31;01:18:34;"Picking the name Einstein was a clear case of deception"

01:18:45;01:18:47;"There could have been some Jews involved,"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"but either way, they're not Einsteins."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"It is funny too that of every Jewish name you could pick,"
01:18:51;01:18:52;"you pick Einstein."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"- Yep."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"- The genius one."

01:19:08;01:19:09;"And I say it's high time"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"that we the Time Crisis community shed light"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"on this important issue"
01:19:12;01:19:16;"and force these corporate frauds to atone for their sins."

01:19:19;01:19:22;"does not appear to engage in Twitter clapbacks."

01:19:44;01:19:45;"What does that mean, a wedding guest book?"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"- They're gonna sign the book?"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"- Or they give the book to everybody at the wedding?"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"No, that'd be too much."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"- Is there like a notes section in the book?"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"- No, it's a very well-designed photo monograph."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"They're gonna write all over it."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"- Well, whatever."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"- Those big open Jake Longstreth vistas,"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"lot of room to write."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"- Just write in those skies."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"- Yeah."
01:20:05;01:20:08;"- Cool that he stumbled across that in his local bookshop."

01:20:14;01:20:15;"I wanna get more to the bottom of it."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"I mean, should we like--"
01:20:16;01:20:19;"- It's pretty funny just creating mascots whole cloth."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"- I mean, it's like when they created Sonic the Hedgehog."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"'Cause Sonic the Hedgehog was created"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"because Sega and the new CEO of Sega,"
01:20:26;01:20:29;"the American guy hired to run it,"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"who used to run Mattel,"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"knew they needed somebody to compete with Mario."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"And so they had a whole company-wide search"
01:20:34;01:20:35;"for what could this thing be,"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"and it became Sonic the Hedgehog."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Boston market was like,"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"we're missing out on a lot of money in the mornings."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"When we're making most of our money at night,"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"we should have a complimentary business"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"that takes over breakfast."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"But then somebody's like, it should be bagels."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"And then somebody was like, let's create a name."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"And then somebody was just like,"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"let's make up a Jewish name, make up Jewish Brothers."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"Or was there a guy who worked at the company"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"who's like, well, you know, my last name's Einstein,"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"no matter what it's made up."
01:20:59;01:21:03;"- It reminds me of the history of Olive Garden."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"- What's the history of Olive Garden?"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"- Well, it wasn't a mom and pop restaurant"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"that did well regionally and then organically expanded."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"I'll tell you that."

01:21:11;01:21:12;"- I'll tell you that much right now."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"- It was founded in 1982 by General Mills."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"- General Mills?"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"- Out of the gate."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"They were just like, you know what?"

01:22:58;01:23:00;"- Probably that's gonna happen more and more actually."
01:23:00;01:23:01;"- Well, I guess what you do--"
01:23:01;01:23:04;"- Is it steeper odds to like start a company from scratch,"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"especially like a restaurant and really expand it to this--"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- Well, you know, it's funny."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"I mean, we were talking on, you know,"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"we're banking that up so things might be out of order,"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"but we were talking in the not too distant past"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"about the chain Panda Express."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"And we of course assumed that Panda Express"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"would be a similar kind of corporate entity"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"that probably had no connection to actual Chinese food"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"or Chinese culture, but then it turns out"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"it was founded by a Chinese American family"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"who's still involved in it,"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"a multi-generational thing actually."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And it made me think about how, you know,"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"you have a lot of these controversies"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"involving food and cultural appropriation."
01:23:35;01:23:37;"And not that long ago, I saw some New York Times headline"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"about two non-Chinese people"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"opened a Chinese restaurant in New York"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"and they described it as being clean Chinese food,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"which is, you know, not very wise."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"And they claimed that they meant,"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"oh, we just meant clean in terms of"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"we were using high quality ingredients"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"and not as if like we're saying,"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"oh, your restaurant's dirty, but no matter what,"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"even just the mere fact that these were non-Chinese people"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"starting a, and they made up a name too,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"it was called Lucky Lee's or something."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"Not very smart."
01:24:05;01:24:10;"- Yeah, you should just call it like Tyler and Brandon's."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"(laughing)"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Whoever started it."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"- Tyler and Brandon's."
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Tyler and Brandon's food."
01:24:16;01:24:17;"- Chinese food."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"- No, not even Chinese."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"Tyler and Brandon present."
01:24:19;01:24:21;"- Asian cuisine."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- Yeah, well, in a way."
01:24:22;01:24:22;"- Pan-Asian."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"- But you know what I was thinking?"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"- There's nothing wrong with, you know,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"starting a restaurant."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"It is funny."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"- There's nothing wrong with starting a restaurant."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"- There's nothing wrong with starting a restaurant."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"- That'd be funny, like Jake,"
01:24:33;01:24:36;"like people just like, like just eviscerating each other"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"in like a hardcore Twitter argument"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"where somebody's like, that's disgusting,"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"cultural appropriation."
01:24:40;01:24:41;"And then somebody's like, like,"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"fuck you, that's not how culture works."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"There's blah, blah, blah, giving all these counter examples."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"And then Jake just walks in and goes, guys, guys,"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"there's nothing wrong with starting a restaurant."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"(laughing)"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"- If we can all agree on one thing,"
01:24:54;01:24:58;"I'm tired of seeing people fight about just Chinese food."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"- Start the restaurant you want to start."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"- Just start it."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"- But don't cover it in fake window dressing."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"- Yeah, just start a restaurant."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- What if it was called Jake's Chinese?"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Pushing it?"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"- Sounds like you're saying Jake is Chinese."
01:25:12;01:25:12;"- Right."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"- A little bit."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"- I think a very clear cut case of false marketing."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"- If I was gonna start a Chinese restaurant."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- Don't do it."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"- If I was gonna start a Chinese restaurant."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"- If I did it."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"- I'm not going to."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- By Jake and OJ Simpson."
01:25:24;01:25:27;"- What would the name be?"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"- You should call the restaurant Don't Do It."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"My point that's interesting with a lot of these"
01:25:31;01:25:34;"conversations, or what I find interesting,"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I'm thinking out loud here, but first of all,"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"I'm not defending that example of a Chinese,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"I don't know, I don't remember the details,"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"but even the details that I remember,"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"I'm just like, mm, come on."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"But the interesting thing that I'm saying is"
01:25:46;01:25:50;"the anonymity of a corporation provides cover"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"for this type of thing."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"So like, you're saying that more of these things"
01:25:54;01:25:57;"might happen, you could imagine that the next"
01:25:57;01:26:00;"generation that grows up of ambitious capitalists,"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"of various backgrounds, and they're like,"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"oh, you're not gonna catch me opening Lucky Lee's."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I know my (beep), I'm not gonna do that."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get General Mills"
01:26:09;01:26:13;"to open a Chinese restaurant that's so anonymous"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"you couldn't even really point a finger at a human being"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"if you wanted to, and even if you did,"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"we would find some weird way to cook the books"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"and be like, what, actually, at our corporation"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"we have many Asian, you know what I mean?"
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- There's no paper trail."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"- There'd be some weird, bizarre way in which--"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"- A lot of shell companies."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"- Yeah, I guess all I'm saying is that"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"this is just an observation, not a critique,"
01:26:34;01:26:37;"just even as you deal with one issue,"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"it's like plugging a bottle with a lot of holes."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"It's a bad thing that I'm saying,"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"or it's a pessimistic thing, it's like the house"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"always wins, one way or another it flows back"
01:26:46;01:26:50;"to corporate control or something like that."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"- Like I said, there's nothing wrong"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"with opening a restaurant."

01:32:00;01:32:03;"- Oh my God, that's what I do most of my day."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"Yeah, no, it's pretty deep."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Yeah, they refer to very specific things in the show."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"- Is it relatively positive energy?"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"- Okay."
01:32:13;01:32:13;"- These are fans."
01:32:13;01:32:14;"- Okay."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"- Yeah."
01:32:15;01:32:18;"- Just a hardcore TC hater, just trolling the subreddit."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"TC fell off after episode 75."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"- I was just gonna say that."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"- So a recent perusal of the TC subreddit"
01:32:24;01:32:27;"led me to this attractive, albeit bootleg,"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"eight minute Cape Cod baseball cap"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"that a fan is selling online at a premium."

01:32:33;01:32:35;"and the concerted effort, but on ethical grounds,"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"I'm torn on whether or not to support TC contraband."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"I know that eight minute Cape Cod is a concept,"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"not a copyrighted phrase, but it's Ezra's concept, right?"
01:32:43;01:32:47;"Well, I would say it's Jake's concept for Vampire Weekend."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"So, wondering what your feelings are"

01:32:51;01:32:52;"Personally, I'd be flattered that TC heads"

01:34:07;01:34:10;"- One thing I'd say is like,"
01:34:10;01:34:11;"I guess the Grateful Dead example,"
01:34:11;01:34:15;"when people really take a concept"
01:34:15;01:34:19;"or like whether it's a TC idea or Vampire Weekend,"
01:34:19;01:34:20;"8 Minute Cave Cut, whatever,"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"and they do their own thing with it,"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"that's good for everybody."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"That's cool."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"You're spreading the word."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"'Cause like when it's also when people talk about bootleg,"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"there's bootleg in the sense that,"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"yes, I do not legally own the intellectual property"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"that I'm referencing here."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"That's one type of bootleg."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"And then there's bootleg like buying a fake Gucci bag,"
01:34:37;01:34:40;"painstakingly made to fake, to like fake figure out."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"So I just kind of feel like,"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"I guess it'd be weird if somebody had a thriving business"
01:34:44;01:34:47;"taking Seinfeld's original 8 Minute Cave Cut design"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"and just like selling that shirt."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"That'd be a little like, all right."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"But if people like being creative about it,"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"that's pretty cool."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"- Yeah, I think you can tell"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"when there's like love put into it."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"And then there's also like the red bubbles"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"and like the zazzles of the world."
01:35:02;01:35:03;"- What the hell is that?"
01:35:03;01:35:04;"- Oh boy."
01:35:04;01:35:08;"Well, I think that is basically a service online"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"that makes it as easy as possible"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"to produce and manufacture a shirt"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"without even having touched the material."
01:35:14;01:35:18;"You just go on and drop like an image into a website"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"and then immediately put it up for sale."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"- When it doesn't actually exist, but it's a print."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"- Yeah, and there's no overhead to you."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"- Yeah, and the quality of the shirts"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"is usually pretty low."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"I mean, there's a ton of Vampire Weekend stuff"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"kicking around on it."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"- Yeah, people have sent me stuff like that."
01:35:31;01:35:34;"And some of that stuff I'm like, okay."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"It's not like, oh, this is my Etsy store."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"I'm like a person who's just trying to make"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"a little extra cash and these are fun drawings I do."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"It wasn't that vibe."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"It was just kind of like fake."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"But we have had some great TC merch."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"I mean, actually right now, Jake,"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"you're wearing that long sleeve."
01:35:47;01:35:48;"- I love this."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- Did we ever talk about that one on the show?"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"- No."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"- 'Cause what was the backstory?"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"- That was like some guys made this insanely detailed"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"long sleeve that they're selling."
01:35:58;01:36:02;"- They have the Instagram, I think it's tcu.llc."
01:36:02;01:36:05;"- I mean, for the time being, do your thing."
01:36:05;01:36:08;"Obviously, I think we gotta reserve the right"
01:36:08;01:36:11;"to change our mind, but the funny thing is"
01:36:11;01:36:14;"is that TC, it's more of an Apple thing than anything."
01:36:14;01:36:17;"But I love this shirt that these guys made."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"And first of all, this is also a shirt"
01:36:18;01:36:22;"that has so many riffs on real stuff."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"Like if Vampire Weekend wanted to make it and sell it,"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"probably my lawyer would be like,"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"""Oh no, you can't sell this on tour."""
01:36:27;01:36:28;"It's got so many details."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"It says Ezra and Jake's in the Ben and Jerry's font."
01:36:31;01:36:35;"Then it riffs on the Grateful Dead, Europe 72 imagery."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"It says Sweet Chili Heat on one sleeve"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"and the other sleeve--"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"- It's just Richard Pictures and Vampire."
01:36:40;01:36:44;"- And it's with a goldfish and a peace frog."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"This shirt is worth checking out."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"It's incredibly detailed."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"- I love the part where they had my email address"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"and crossed it out and then underneath it,"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"it said 8-Minute."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"Wait, what's the address?"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"- 8-Minute Cape Cod with a number eight."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Yeah, this shirt is like a real conversation piece."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Like if somebody didn't know anything about time crisis"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"and you came to a party with this shirt,"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"that's 90 minutes right there."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"- Yep, if there was a time crisis live show"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"and you came across this in the lot,"
01:37:07;01:37:08;"you'd be like, ""Holy (beep)."""
01:37:08;01:37:09;"- Grail."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"- That's a grail."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"I mean, it's similar to Seinfeld working on those"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"commemorative Subway Series shirts"
01:37:15;01:37:18;"for when we went on the REM podcast."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"- Right."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"- It also reminds me of when Seinfeld made the poster"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"of the TCU."
01:37:23;01:37:24;"I love that stuff."
01:37:24;01:37:24;"- Oh yeah."
01:37:24;01:37:29;"- Just true, insanely detailed merchandise for heads only."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"- Yep."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"I mean, I feel like this shirt was made"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"with a lot of love and attention to detail."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"- Oh, definitely, yeah."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"- I mean, I think it's great."

01:40:10;01:40:14;"- Well, so in this email,"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"I wonder what this eight minute Cape Cod hat looked like."
01:40:17;01:40:17;"- I've seen it."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"It's like a white dad hat with like the multicolored,"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"it's like that embroidered."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"- Oh, it's like the shirts?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- Yeah."
01:40:24;01:40:25;"I'm trying to find it."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"- Well, when you type in eight minute Cape Cod,"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"a lot of stuff comes up in Google."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"- Yeah, there's a red bubble."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:40:31;01:40:34;"Meme, time crisis, meaning."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Oh, there's the Reddit, Vampire Weekend,"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"what is eight minute Cape Cod?"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- Oh yeah, that's that stuff I should never see."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"- No."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"- Oh yeah, so some people are just,"
01:40:42;01:40:43;"yeah, that's whack when people are just selling"
01:40:43;01:40:44;"your original design."
01:40:44;01:40:47;"- It's not even the right font."
01:40:47;01:40:50;"- Yeah, we're looking at one that's just like a black shirt"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"that just says eight minute Cape Cod."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"- And someone's just selling that on Reddit?"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"- But no, but this is like, no, not on Reddit."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"- What's this website?"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"- Society6, it's another one of those."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"- That's another like Zazzle?"
01:41:00;01:41:04;"- Yeah, it's another like, you can make 25.99."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I can tell you the quality of this material,"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"it's probably very thin."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Like when we do the giveaways, we really,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"you know, it's like heavyweight cotton."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"It's like a good, you know,"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"and like the one you're wearing now,"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"the one we were discussing, it's like a nice fabric."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"It's like a well-made, someone, yeah."
01:41:19;01:41:22;"These are gonna be like almost see-through, it's not."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"- All right, so you know,"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"if you're gonna do the TC bootleg merch."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"- And I get, you know, it's also interesting."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"- Give it a little creativity, folks."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"- I'm also at this place now where I'm actually"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"really getting into the weeds on, you know,"
01:41:34;01:41:35;"we gotta start making a lot of merchandise"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"to go on tour with."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"- Yeah."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"- Oh, that hat's nice."
01:41:39;01:41:39;"That's a cute hat."
01:41:39;01:41:42;"- That's the bootleg white hat."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- That's cool."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"If somebody makes their own creative thing"
01:41:44;01:41:47;"that's based off of TC or Vampire Weekend,"
01:41:47;01:41:50;"like that's like a type of fandom."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"I don't think anybody's like taken away"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"from the organization, you know?"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"And when they even think a step further,"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"like yeah, if somebody just made a fake version"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"of a shirt that we were selling at the show,"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"I'd be like, come on, that's not that cool."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"But when I think about what kind of shirts"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"we would actually make to sell at the shows,"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"'cause we're doing some stuff now,"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"we're doing some more cool stuff with the,"
01:42:08;01:42:11;"you know, Andrew bringing out your dad."
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- Oh, cool, cool."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"- 'Cause, you know, we gotta make sure"
01:42:13;01:42:17;"we have another special show for that Father's Day show."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"- Yeah, we are working currently"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"on our summer tour T-shirt."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"- Oh, tight, gonna sell that there."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"Ventura County Fairgrounds, Old Town Pub,"
01:42:27;01:42:31;"Huntington Bank Pavilion, Old Town Pub,"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Hollywood Bowl, that's the tour."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"- That's a hell of a, do you think there'll be anybody"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"who will be at all of those shows in the crowd?"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"- All five?"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"- Yeah. - No."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"- No way. - Not a single person?"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"It's a real RPS."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"- Someone that saw us at Skull and Roses"
01:42:44;01:42:48;"would then travel to Chicago for the Vampire Show."
01:42:48;01:42:52;"I don't know, I was in town visiting my folks, you know."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"- They're just on the road, man."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"But anyway, my point is, you know,"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"now we're starting to think a little bit about,"
01:42:57;01:43:00;"all right, there's gonna be a lot of fun merch stuff"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"this year, 'cause we'll sell some stuff on the road,"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"we'll do exclusive event merch, we'll do online only,"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"you know, whatever, there'll be all sorts of show only,"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"there's gonna be a lot of fun merch."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"But when I think about all the cool stuff"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"that we wanna do, I don't foresee us making"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"an eight minute Cape Cod shirt."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Like, that'd be a little jumping the shark"
01:43:17;01:43:20;"if VW started selling an eight minute Cape Cod shirt"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"at the merch booth at the show."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"- Yeah."
01:43:23;01:43:26;"- It's like a concept that's made for the heads"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"to make their own stuff, you know?"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- Yeah."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"- There can't be--"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"- Yeah, that's not official."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"- You can't do official eight minute."
01:43:33;01:43:35;"The only eight minute Cape Cod gear that we've made,"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"also, that's been stuff that Seinfeld made and we gave away."
01:43:38;01:43:40;"If we start selling eight minute Cape, yeah."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"I also like it too, because it's like, yeah,"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"we're gonna make stuff that says Vampire Weekend,"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"people like to buy shirts that say Vampire Weekend"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"at the show, but the eight minute Cape Cod (beep)"
01:43:48;01:43:51;"is also, not only is it sold by heads,"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"it's made for the heads, 'cause like, a lot of people,"
01:43:54;01:43:57;"a kind of more like passing fan is not gonna particularly"
01:43:57;01:44:00;"wanna rock the eight minute Cape Cod thing."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"- Yeah, it's more TCU."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"- It's right at the intersection."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"I actually like that idea, you know, like,"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"now Vampire Weekend's been around long enough"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"and the universe has expanded enough"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"that there are gonna be different factions"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"within the fan base."
01:44:13;01:44:14;"So like, that show in Chicago,"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"that's gonna be a big old show."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"Be a lot of people there, at least 10,000."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"We'll see what we get to."
01:44:19;01:44:22;"So I'm picturing all these people at this show"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"and, you know, people are just walking around"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"and I like to imagine this."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Obviously everybody there is probably at least"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"a Vampire Weekend fan or like was dragged there"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"by a Vampire Weekend fan."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"But then imagine, you know, you're going to get a beer"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"and you walk past somebody else"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"wearing an eight minute Cape Cod shirt."
01:44:36;01:44:39;"Now you're in a subcategory, a subculture,"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"and you say like, you nod to them as a fellow TC head"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"and say, look, there's a lot of people here"
01:44:43;01:44:46;"who are VW heads, they're not TC heads."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"You have a moment, maybe a quick pound,"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"maybe a stop and chat, I don't know."
01:44:50;01:44:53;"But it's a shared moment for the TC head community"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"within the concert."
01:44:55;01:44:55;"- Yep."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"- And that's something special."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"So yeah, for now, I don't see an issue with any of this."
