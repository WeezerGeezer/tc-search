04:18;04:47;"What are you willing to do?"
04:47;05:08;"Kiss it, kiss it, better baby"
05:09;05:11;"Now this is not just a Hanukkah show, I want to be clear"
05:11;05:15;"We're starting this off right away, that's gonna send off a shot"
05:15;05:19;"A lot of Jews in New York are gonna be like ""Oh, look Mike D immediately sells us out"""
05:19;05:23;"And like everyone else in the world is like ""I'm not effing with him anymore"""
05:23;05:27;"He's not standing up for us, but I'm just saying this is multicultural"
05:27;05:29;"It's all about the experience"
05:29;05:30;"I appreciate that"
05:30;05:31;"Have we started?"
05:31;05:32;"Yeah we have started"
05:32;05:33;"This is the show"
05:33;05:34;"This is the holiday edition"
05:34;05:35;"It's not a Hanukkah show"
05:35;05:38;"It's not a Hanukkah show, although one of the things I want to get into"
05:38;05:42;"And I'm gonna need some help and I think Ezra you might just be the man for this job"
05:42;05:47;"Is I looked it up briefly, the first day of Hanukkah is gonna be Christmas Eve"
05:47;05:53;"This coinciding of Hanukkah and Christmas happens roughly four times in a century"
05:53;05:55;"Whoa, yeah I don't really remember it"
05:55;06:00;"I remember Hanukkah coinciding with Thanksgiving in the past"
06:00;06:02;"Right, yeah it can go all over the place"
06:02;06:07;"That's the problem of the calendar we're on being non-lunar"
06:07;06:08;"Right"
06:08;06:09;"Cool guys"
06:09;06:11;"But this is not a Hanukkah show"
06:11;06:12;"I'm bored as f***"
06:12;06:14;"Whatever, we're opening this up"
06:14;06:17;"No I was actually just trying to use fancy words for the moon"
06:17;06:18;"I'm out"
06:18;06:22;"This is not an ethnocentric, one culture kind of show"
06:22;06:26;"We're talking about Hanukkah, Christmas"
06:26;06:29;"Those might be the only holidays at exactly the same time"
06:29;06:30;"Who sets the date for Kwanzaa?"
06:30;06:33;"That's a good question, I don't know where Kwanzaa falls"
06:33;06:36;"I know Ramadan also varies year to year"
06:36;06:38;"Kwanzaa December 26th"
06:38;06:40;"Isn't Boxing Day December 26th?"
06:40;06:44;"Is Boxing Day always the day after Christmas or two days after Christmas?"
06:44;06:46;"I'm not sure, then you guys"
06:46;06:48;"The best part is none of it matters"
06:48;06:50;"Yeah, cause let's keep it real"
06:50;06:53;"It matters a lot, that's gonna determine right there"
06:53;06:58;"It matters to some people but this is America and the only God is money"
06:58;07:00;"Let's keep it real, that's what we celebrate"
07:00;07:04;"That's what the Christians, the Jews, everybody celebrates that"
07:04;07:08;"Because it's paper, it's money, it's presents"
07:08;07:10;"That's why we got Trump as the president"
07:10;07:11;"That's right, yeah"
07:11;07:13;"That's why gold is the new green"
07:13;07:15;"And orange is the new skin"
07:15;07:22;"I don't think Hanukkah is very well represented culturally"
07:22;07:27;"Like I don't ever hear about Hanukkah other than like family"
07:27;07:29;"Or see it on TV"
07:29;07:31;"Well cause it's a minor holiday"
07:31;07:37;"It's a minor work of the holiday"
07:37;07:40;"Well it's not like a high holy day"
07:40;07:42;"I mean there's no, I don't, I'm not"
07:42;07:43;"It's a minor holiday"
07:43;07:46;"If it was a Jay-Z album it'd be Kingdom Come"
07:46;07:47;"That's what Hanukkah is"
07:47;07:48;"Shots fired"
07:48;07:50;"Jay-Z would agree with that"
07:50;07:51;"Is Jay-Z Jewish?"
07:51;07:53;"No but Jay Brown apparently is"
07:53;07:55;"Jew or not?"
07:56;07:59;"My understanding is that Hanukkah"
07:59;08:02;"The really important Jewish holidays are like Yom Kippur"
08:02;08:03;"Day of Atonement"
08:03;08:04;"That's a serious one"
08:04;08:05;"That's serious"
08:05;08:06;"That's high holy days"
08:06;08:08;"You call everybody, you apologize, it's serious"
08:08;08:11;"Rosh Hashanah, it's the new year, you know"
08:11;08:14;"And my understanding is that Hanukkah is a minor holiday"
08:14;08:16;"It's really more just like a story"
08:16;08:17;"We just remember a story"
08:17;08:21;"About a group of religious zealots called the Maccabees"
08:21;08:24;"And my understanding is that when the Jews show up in America"
08:24;08:26;"And come Christmas time"
08:26;08:28;"They don't really want to celebrate Christmas"
08:28;08:29;"Feels funny"
08:29;08:30;"Because they're not Christian"
08:30;08:32;"So they say well what holidays do we have"
08:32;08:34;"That roughly fall around Christmas"
08:34;08:36;"And then you got Hanukkah and suddenly"
08:36;08:38;"It grows in stature"
08:38;08:40;"It becomes a Jewish Christmas"
08:40;08:43;"But it never really takes off the way we all had hoped"
08:43;08:44;"Exactly"
08:44;08:45;"It does, it's"
08:45;08:48;"Christmas is a genuinely important holiday"
08:48;08:49;"For the Christians"
08:49;08:50;"Right"
08:50;08:51;"Hanukkah you could take or leave"
08:51;08:53;"That's my understanding"
08:53;08:54;"No, that's not bad"
08:54;08:56;"Isn't it representative of Judaism"
08:56;08:59;"That the biggest holiday is the one about atoning"
08:59;09:01;"And how you f***ed up all year"
09:01;09:04;"It's like a serious sad holiday"
09:04;09:06;"Not really like a"
09:06;09:08;"Yeah but I give props to that"
09:08;09:09;"It's heavy"
09:09;09:11;"It's heavy and it should"
09:11;09:14;"You know it's kind of like doing a 12 step program"
09:14;09:16;"And going to your therapist all in one"
09:16;09:17;"Right"
09:17;09:19;"And you get that big meal at the end"
09:19;09:20;"And dieting"
09:20;09:21;"Yeah"
09:21;09:22;"Yeah that's true"
09:22;09:23;"I don't know what to make of Hanukkah"
09:23;09:25;"I don't think it was a traditional thing"
09:25;09:28;"That you give somebody a present every night of Hanukkah"
09:28;09:29;"Right"
09:29;09:30;"That hence the America role"
09:30;09:31;"I know but I was going to say"
09:31;09:32;"But I feel like growing up in New York"
09:32;09:33;"I think you're right"
09:33;09:34;"And there was like this thing in terms of"
09:34;09:37;"Modern New York City Jew action"
09:37;09:39;"Actually there's a couple points I want to get to"
09:39;09:40;"One"
09:40;09:41;"Yeah"
09:41;09:42;"The Hanukkah bush came into existence"
09:42;09:44;"Now I don't think I ever saw a Hanukkah bush"
09:44;09:45;"Is that real"
09:45;09:47;"But people would always talk about like the Hanukkah bush"
09:47;09:49;"Are people going to listen to the three of us"
09:49;09:50;"Talking about Hanukkah"
09:50;09:52;"I feel like no one is going to give a f*** about this"
09:52;09:54;"This is way too ethnocentric"
09:54;09:55;"We gotta get out of this"
09:55;09:57;"I was driving here today like"
09:57;10:00;"Man I'm going to be in a room with like Mike D and Ezra"
10:00;10:01;"That's dope"
10:01;10:03;"And then like"
10:03;10:05;"This is not what I expected to talk about"
10:05;10:07;"Like I was like expecting to talk about other sh*t"

18:32;18:33;"Yeah."
18:33;18:35;"Wait, wait, wait."
18:35;18:36;"Hillary lost because of Monica?"
18:36;18:37;"I don't know why I co-signed that"
18:37;18:41;"without knowing what you were talking about."
18:41;18:43;"Ezra, where are you going with this?"
18:43;18:44;"Why did Hillary lost?"
18:44;18:45;"How is that?"
18:45;18:47;"Because too many Jews get on the radio"
18:47;18:49;"just talking about Hanukkah all the time."
18:49;18:53;"It's disrespectful to our American brothers and sisters"
18:53;18:54;"who don't care about it."
18:54;18:55;"I just got one."
18:55;18:56;"No, Bernie's on the hill."
18:56;18:57;"I'm like, ""Change the subject."
18:57;18:59;"They don't like that stuff."""
18:59;19:01;"I don't think Bernie--"
19:01;19:03;"Guys, switch it up."
19:03;19:04;"I don't think Bernie likes the candles."
19:04;19:05;"It doesn't play on a mask, yo."
19:05;19:07;"I just got one question for you guys."
19:07;19:09;"I was just thinking about this."
19:09;19:12;"Because you know every year there's this war on Christmas stuff"
19:12;19:14;"and Donald Trump's been making a point of saying,"
19:14;19:16;"""Merry Christmas,"" and people are like,"
19:16;19:19;"""Finally, a president with some cojones"
19:19;19:21;"who can not do this happy holiday stuff."""
19:21;19:24;"Growing up, I don't know if you guys celebrated Christmas."
19:24;19:26;"My family didn't celebrate Christmas."
19:26;19:28;"Did you care when people would say, ""Merry Christmas,"" to you?"
19:28;19:30;"Were you like, ""How about happy holidays next time?"""
19:30;19:32;"How do you feel about that?"
19:32;19:33;"I don't give a f--"
19:33;19:35;"Every time somebody rolls up to you and says, ""Happy Christmas,"""
19:35;19:37;"""Merry Christmas,"" you're cool with it."
19:37;19:38;"I'm all good with it."
19:38;19:39;"Yeah, me too."
19:39;19:41;"I feel like I grew up on the upper west side of New York."
19:41;19:43;"As long as they weren't chasing me down the block,"
19:43;19:46;"I'll take happy Christmas, happy Hanukkah, happy holidays,"
19:46;19:48;"equal opportunity."
19:48;19:51;"Because I don't think anyone means anything by it."
19:51;19:52;"They're not being disrespectful."
19:52;19:54;"Whatever you all do, I'm good with it."
19:54;19:58;"I say happy holidays to people during this time of year."
19:58;20:00;"I'm with that. I'm a happy holiday person."
20:00;20:01;"Happy holidays is just--"
20:01;20:06;"That's probably why I'm not elected president right now."
20:06;20:08;"Right. If you want to be president, you have to say, ""Merry Christmas."""
20:08;20:09;"Were you interested?"
20:09;20:11;"I'm not Kanye. You just need pictures of me and Trump."
20:11;20:12;"Oh, man."
20:12;20:13;"We'll see."
20:13;20:14;"Okay."
20:14;20:17;"This is my last Hanukkah train of thought, and then we'll abandon it."
20:17;20:19;"Okay, we're going to pull the cord."
20:19;20:22;"But before we pull the cord, everyone is shaking his head."
20:22;20:24;"I tried getting you out of this."
20:24;20:28;"I tried getting you out of this, and you still will not leave it alone."
20:28;20:29;"All right."
20:29;20:33;"I think there was a funny thing that would happen with Jews in New York where,"
20:33;20:39;"okay, it's Christmas, everything is closed, so you'd go eat at the Chinese restaurant."
20:39;20:40;"Right, classic."
20:40;20:41;"Movie, empty movie."
20:41;20:42;"Right."
20:42;20:45;"Now, probably some people are going to be like, ""See how disrespectful Mike Diaz is?"""
20:45;20:46;"No, but that's like--"
20:46;20:47;"Dissing a Chinese restaurant like that."
20:47;20:48;"That's a trope."
20:48;20:49;"Wait, are you dissing it?"
20:49;20:50;"No, I'm not."
20:50;20:51;"I'm just saying it was actually great."
20:51;20:54;"Thank God there was the one thing open, and there was this tradition,"
20:54;20:58;"which I think was a cool modern-day New York City Jewish tradition"
20:58;21:02;"of going to the Chinese restaurant with whole big families on Christmas Day."
21:02;21:05;"And then I don't know if they're related, but my family,"
21:05;21:10;"we would go every Sunday to the Chun Sha Fu on 90th Street and Broadway."
21:10;21:13;"And that was like our Sunday dinner."
21:13;21:15;"It would be early because we were little kids."
21:15;21:18;"It would be like 6 o'clock, and they had the big Lazy Susan."
21:18;21:19;"Yeah, that's so fun."
21:19;21:20;"It was awesome."
21:20;21:24;"And they had like a whole bunch of pork and sesame noodles and egg rolls"
21:24;21:29;"and whatever, like all up in the middle on the Lazy Susan,"
21:29;21:32;"twirling it around as one would want to do."
21:32;21:33;"Right."
21:33;21:35;"And it was a very special time."
21:35;21:36;"No, I think that--"
21:36;21:37;"It was Sunday night."
21:37;21:41;"The tradition, you know, in terms of like a holiday, it's like a tradition."
21:41;21:42;"See, I think that's great."
21:42;21:46;"That's more of the [no audio] that I'm interested in than like the--"
21:46;21:50;"I'd be more curious to hear your guys' like personal experiences with Hanukkah"
21:50;21:53;"than like the cultural understanding and stuff like that."
21:53;21:54;"You know what I mean?"
21:54;21:56;"Like that's what's interesting about holidays,"
21:56;21:59;"that we're Americanized Jews who celebrate Hanukkah."
21:59;22:03;"Like we're like generations away from how it started, right?"
22:03;22:07;"So what is the manifestation of like how you personally experienced it?"
22:07;22:08;"That's interesting to me."
22:08;22:10;"You know what I mean?"
22:10;22:13;"Like that sounds awesome that you guys went every year on Christmas"
22:13;22:14;"to a Chinese restaurant."
22:14;22:17;"Yeah, we got Chun Chow Foo down the street."
22:17;22:18;"That sounds great."
22:18;22:20;"Eventually we had like a summer house in Long Island,"
22:20;22:23;"and we'd be out there on Christmas Day,"
22:23;22:27;"and we didn't have a Chinese restaurant down the street."
22:27;22:29;"So then we fully sold out."
22:29;22:30;"We embraced it."
22:30;22:31;"We had the Christmas tree."
22:31;22:32;"Really?"
22:32;22:33;"Oh, you had a Christmas tree."
22:33;22:34;"Never had a Christmas tree in my life."
22:34;22:36;"We went full Christmas."
22:36;22:37;"I love Christmas."
22:37;22:38;"I just never had a Christmas tree."
22:38;22:40;"But then my parents shut that down because there was one year"
22:40;22:43;"where you're like my brothers and I woke them up."
22:43;22:46;"And we like literally woke up, and we were so excited to run."
22:46;22:48;"Like the whole idea that there was going to be Christmas"
22:48;22:51;"and that we were going to get Christmas presents was so exciting to us"
22:51;22:53;"that we woke up at like 5 in the morning."
22:53;22:55;"And my parents were like, ""No."""
22:55;22:56;"Yeah."
22:56;22:57;"It's not worth it."
22:57;22:59;"You got to chill."
22:59;23:01;"You got to chill on this Christmas stuff."
23:01;23:02;"Yeah."
23:02;23:04;"I could not imagine a world where in my house growing up"
23:04;23:06;"there was like a Christmas tree,"
23:06;23:09;"and like me and my siblings like ran downstairs in matching pajamas"
23:09;23:11;"tearing open Christmas presents."
23:11;23:12;"It sounds so fun."
23:12;23:14;"We didn't have matching pajamas, but we did."
23:14;23:17;"We ran to the house at 5 in the morning in darkness"
23:17;23:19;"and started ripping open presents."
23:19;23:21;"That sounds really fun."
23:21;23:24;"That was really fun, and then my parents immediately shut it down."
50:01;50:04;"-I feel disrespected by Ezra."
50:04;50:09;"I feel disrespected by the assumption"
50:09;50:14;"and even to presuppose that a latke was not enjoyed"
50:14;50:18;"by my great, great, great, great, great, great, great ancestors."
50:18;50:21;"-I'm sorry, the truth. -All I know is--"
50:21;50:26;"-In the Jewish calendar, it's the year 5,777."
50:26;50:30;"-I want to establish when the potato crossed over."
50:30;50:33;"-The latke was invented in 1992 by Suge Knight."
50:33;50:35;"[laughter]"
50:35;50:38;"-By Suge Knight and D.O.C."
50:38;50:40;"-All right, I'm going into latke number three."
50:40;50:43;"-I'm going to tell right now-- -Latke number three sucks."
50:43;50:45;"-Really? -It just sucks."
50:45;50:48;"-I think two's the winner. Ezra, what you think, man?"
50:48;50:53;"-I'm with you, number two. -Number three's trash."
50:53;50:56;"-That ain't right. I put that in there. That ain't right, Kyra."
50:57;50:58;"-D.O.C.? -It just sucks."
50:58;51:01;"-I like it. -It's like a dog with wet hair."
51:01;51:05;"-You don't want that. -Deep down, I've always seen latkes"
51:05;51:09;"primarily as an applesauce delivery mechanism."

58:07;58:11;"- The first potato hits European soil in 15--"
58:11;58:13;"- It drops."
58:13;58:15;"- In 15 minutes."
58:15;58:16;"- It drops."
58:16;58:18;"- In 1536, it's a big drop."
58:18;58:20;"So probably at first it's in Spain,"
58:20;58:22;"but there were many trade--"
58:22;58:24;"- Apple exclusive."
58:24;58:26;"- It was an apple exclusive."
58:26;58:28;"There was a window period of about two weeks"
58:28;58:30;"where they only had--"
58:30;58:32;"- Saint Lowe did one of those two hour interviews"
58:32;58:34;"where he kisses the potato's ass for two hours."
58:34;58:36;"- He's like, now, so when you first arrived,"
58:36;58:38;"you first arrived in Spain, okay,"
58:38;58:40;"and you're looking at these Spanish people,"
58:40;58:42;"and what were you thinking?"
58:42;58:44;"You were like the new Kanye of Spain."
58:44;58:45;"- They start trading potatoes,"
58:45;58:47;"maybe potatoes make it to Eastern Europe,"
58:47;58:49;"you know, Poland, Russia, wherever,"
58:49;58:52;"10, 20 years later, so then it's, you know, 1550,"
58:52;58:54;"and then somebody has to think to start frying them up,"
58:54;58:56;"and then somebody has to start thinking"
58:56;58:58;"to fry them up at Hanukkah."
58:58;59:00;"I'm just saying that eating latkes"
59:00;59:02;"is probably a 400 year tradition."
59:02;59:04;"So that's still a tradition."
59:04;59:06;"- That's still old, I mean, listen,"
59:06;59:08;"in terms of the history of this country,"
59:08;59:10;"that's old as--"
59:10;59:12;"- It's very old, but that also means"
59:13;59:14;"that in a mere 400 years,"
59:14;59:16;"Mike D's Hanukkah special could be part"
59:16;59:18;"of the Jewish tradition."
59:18;59:20;"I'm just saying, they're not ancient."
59:20;59:22;"- I feel like the latke is like what Ezra"
59:22;59:24;"was talking about, the delivery device,"
59:24;59:26;"like you had the latke sandwiches,"
59:26;59:28;"you really gotta look at it as a device"
59:28;59:30;"of bringing in other food into the game."
59:30;59:32;"- Changing things up."
59:32;59:34;"- Where people used to have, maybe use bread,"
59:34;59:36;"and you have the latke, that would be like in LA."
59:36;59:38;"- Well, back in the day, bread had less gluten in it."
59:38;59:40;"- Yeah, wait, what?"
59:40;59:42;"Hold on, hold on, how does this go from there?"
59:42;59:43;"- Truth bombs."
59:43;59:45;"- Yeah, man."
59:45;59:47;"- Give me a bomb."
59:47;59:49;"(electronic music)"
59:49;59:51;"Back in the day, bread had less gluten in it."
59:51;59:53;"- Why has that changed?"
59:53;59:55;"- Because of industrial farming, Monsanto--"
59:55;59:57;"- Okay, so post-World War II."
59:57;59:59;"- CIA, Illuminati, they started, man,"
59:59;01:00:01;"okay, take this with a grain of salt,"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"but it used to be there were many types"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"of wheats all over the world."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"You live here, you eat this type of wheat,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"you live there, you eat one type of wheat."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"As with the latke, you had wheat,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"you had one type of wheat."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"As with bananas and a lot of other things"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"that are controlled by gigantic,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"disgusting conglomerations,"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"they start making just one type of wheat."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"There's no diversity in wheat anymore."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"So we keep getting this, as they bred the wheat,"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"we got this very high-gluten concept."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"That's why when you go to your Whole Foods,"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"to your Erawan's, to your local organic market,"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"you're gonna see a lot of ancient grains,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"because people are trying to get back"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"to the old grains that were healthier,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"had less gluten,"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"(laughing)"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"so here we are, we're eating potatoes,"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"we're eating corporate wheat,"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"and meanwhile, the ancient grains"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"are sitting empty."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"We got thieves in the temple."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"- It smells like latke in this so hard."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"- I think it's, I'm telling you,"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"I think it's the greasy one,"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"the greasy one that's really stinking stuff up."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"All right, so let's wait, first real quick,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"what's the winner?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"We know we have the clear loser."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Latke number three sucked, straight up."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"- Trash."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- I mean, that ain't right."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Ezra, your mouth's full of latke right now,"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"but I think we all agree,"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- I didn't like one either."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I thought one and three were both bad."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"- Better than three."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"- I thought two."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"- One I could eat, three was inedible."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"- Yeah, one at least wasn't just straight up."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"- It's latke time."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"- If I was starving, I could flip you off"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"with number one."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- One is not bad, two is just good."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- Three was an F, one was a C minus."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- I say C plus."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- I mean, to be honest,"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"but look, number two is still,"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"nothing ever got better than a B minus for me."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"- I think two is pretty good."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"They just had to sat out for a cold."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"- You're giving it a B plus?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- I don't know why you guys popped these"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"in the freezer before you brought them out here."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"That seemed unnecessary."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"You should have shoved a stick in them"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"and made some vodka sauce."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"- They needed to be hot and crispy."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"My culinary staff was not cracked."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- My crack staff was not cracked today."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"They are on crack."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- So we have a clear winner, number two."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Colin, where is number two from?"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"- I just saw it."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"- Do not even tell me."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"- Trader Joe's."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"- Wow."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- So our winner in the latke shootout"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"is from Trader Joe's."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"- But I can defend why."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"Because they were probably frozen"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"from Trader Joe's and you had to cook them,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"which means they were freshly cooked,"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"which unravels all of the theory"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"of where the others were take out."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- The other ones were take out?"
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- I think that is why they are from the pan"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"sooner than the other one."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- Uh-oh."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"- Recount."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"- Putin."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- You got a Putin drop?"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"- Message."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"- So yeah, we are Putin right now."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"- Damn, I just beautiful minded the"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- It is like a time out."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"- This whole latke contest."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"I was drawing on that glass over there"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"on that window, just drawing formulas."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"- So for curiosity's sake,"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"and we now have established"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"who those three from."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- The most hated was from"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"- Was from Jones."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"- Jones on third?"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"- Oh man, how are you going to eat latke from there?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"- Yeah, but Jones, they probably have a truffle latke"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"or a truffle something."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"- Jones is probably Jewish."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- Jones ain't Jewish."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"- Really?"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"- I don't know, I just think it's funny"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"for me to have beef with Jones for no reason."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- Jones."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"- How could you?"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"- Oh man, Jones."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"- It's Mike Jones."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"- Oh, it's not a first name."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"- No."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"- Okay, they're all forgiven."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"- 8004, that's the phone number for Jones on third."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- And number one was from Cantor's."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- That makes sense to me,"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"because the one that's like, all right."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"- Cantor's is just all right."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"- I wouldn't think that I would get"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"an exceptional latke at Cantor's."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"The whole thing with Cantor's is that"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"it's a brand name Jewish deli."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"The first time I came to LA,"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"the first Jewish deli we went to,"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"it was like, Cantor's is where you hang out."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"It's not because the food is good."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"- I don't know if it was the first time we went there,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"but the very first time we went to LA,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"same trip we went to Fatburger."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"We go to Cantor's, because it's open late"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"and we're from New York,"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"we know what deli food is."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"- They don't have keys to Cantor's."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"- Whoa, really?"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"- Because it's never closed, there's no key."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- Wow."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- Or like a crazy dude told me that at Cantor's,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"that might be some bull."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"- This was not our very first trip to LA."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"- We were on the Lake of Virgin tour."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"- Wow."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"- We were standing in front of the pastry counter,"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Cantor's, in the front there,"

01:04:40;01:04:42;"to people about Rodney Dangerfield."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"- Oh wow."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"- We, having grown up on Caddyshack."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"- Back to school."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"- Huge thing."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"And if you get down to it, guys,"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"I think the reality is--"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"- Easy money."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"- In terms of white rappers on record,"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"the only white rappers that had big records before us"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"were the Black Eyed Peas."

01:10:22;01:10:25;"Okay, I can think about, I've been seeing some of the year end lists,"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"so I can think of all the albums that I've been seeing up there."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"A lot of good albums."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"A lot of superstars on that stage."

01:10:37;01:10:40;"it seems weird to pick a Kanye song after that conversation."

01:10:41;01:10:42;"Why?"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"If there were albums, I'd have to put Pablo as one of my top five."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"I think it would be--"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I think it would be a top ten album."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"I think it would be a top five album pretty good."
01:10:50;01:10:51;"Definitely."
01:10:51;01:10:55;"Even as disconcerted as I was with the recent news."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"Yeah, but like, I talk about this all the time."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Why does it matter what someone's doing in their personal life?"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"It has no bearing on their art."

01:11:02;01:11:03;"I guess, but--"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Well, you could make the case, and I'm not saying--"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"I'm not saying vote for whoever as person of the year, not even Kanye."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"I'm not even passing judgment."

01:13:54;01:13:56;"- My defense with Kanye always is,"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"'cause he's a very polarizing character,"
01:13:58;01:14:02;"is I think in terms of being an artist and an agitator,"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"we need both in our world."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"We need people who are making great art,"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"and we need people that are agitating"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"that are getting the discussion going,"
01:14:09;01:14:13;"and he does both and has done both so reliably for so long."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"- I think a lot of people feel like he may be"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"setting a new level now."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"(laughing)"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"- I just don't think one affects the other."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"- I kind of agree with your point, but in this case,"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"it actually changed my feeling somehow about Kanye."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"It was hard for me."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"I still don't know how I feel."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"It's kind of like when I saw Henry Rollins"
01:14:33;01:14:37;"on the Calvin Klein billboard by Lafayette and Houston."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"'Cause I grew up like a punk rock kid,"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"and I love Black Flag."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- Right, I just saw that."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"- And so Henry Rollins was holier than thou,"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"and then to see him as a,"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"and that's like he's a grown man."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"It's his choice if he wants to be that,"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"that intellectually I'm fine with it,"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"but somehow in my gut it felt really weird."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"- Right, I think Kanye is a different thing"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"because it seems like, I can't even speculate."
01:14:59;01:15:03;"I'm just saying it seems like more medical,"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"I would say medical issues than choices."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"- My biggest takeaway is just that I felt like,"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"okay, it was one thing, I felt like we were"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"at this Mike Judge point of where"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"America had become idiocracy,"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"but now we've gone beyond that where it's like"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Matt and Trey Parker really are writing the script."
01:15:21;01:15:26;"It's really now South Park because it's Kanye going from,"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"he was just recently committed to a mental,"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"he's on a forced psychiatric hold,"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"and then he's visiting the president of the United States."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"This is a South Park episode, people."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"- Yeah, I mean, we have no idea what's going on."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"- I'm just saying."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"- Yeah, we can't speculate on someone's personal life,"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"but the point being it's like,"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"did he even meet Trump?"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"We don't know."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"- Have potatoes ever even existed at all?"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"- So you're saying it just existed on the Twitter."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"- Or are latkes made of Skittles?"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"- All right, well we are talking about top--"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"- Yeah, okay."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"- Top favorites of the year."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"- Same Drugs by Chance."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"- I'm gonna air high five you,"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"'cause I was gonna pick Same Drugs by Chance the Rapper."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"- Really? - Really."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"- That's cool that that was both the same song,"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"'cause it's not like one of the--"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- Well, 'cause there's other songs,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"like the one with Lil Wayne on his album."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"- Yeah, and Smoke Breaks is a great song."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- But for me, Same Drugs, I relate--"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- No problem."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Same Drugs is emotional to me."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"- No comment on my, I think it's emotional."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"I relate to it, and I don't feel like I,"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"I don't know, in terms of like,"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"it's a great relationship song."

01:33:22;01:33:24;"But there's something I like about--"
01:33:24;01:33:28;"because obviously, there's the more indie songs that maybe"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"have a personal relationship with."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"And there's songs like ""Work"" that are true pop songs."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"So you hear it all around you."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Go to the supermarket, you hear it."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"And there's something about the vibe of that song,"
01:33:37;01:33:38;"similar to ""Formation."""
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Teenagers pull up on Silver Lake in a car,"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"just blasting ""Work"" at me."
01:33:41;01:33:42;"Very funny, guys."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"You know that was my song in 2016."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"But ""Work,"" there's something about it that's like--"
01:33:47;01:33:48;"it's an eerie pop song."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"That's also very affecting."
01:33:50;01:33:53;"And like, I do think the giant songs deserve"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"their own category, because I probably"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"didn't listen to ""Work"" a lot, just like on my earbuds."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"But I heard it constantly."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"And just that, you know, like the dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun,"
01:34:03;01:34:06;"like the weird echo on the synth."
01:34:06;01:34:11;"It was an eerie, vibey song for like a distressing year."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"Rolling, rolling, rolling."
01:34:13;01:34:16;"How many more shots until you're rolling?"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"We just need to face to face."

01:34:26;01:34:28;"work, work, work."
01:34:28;01:34:30;"It set me up in work, work, work, work, work, work."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"You see me doing my da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Something 'bout that work, work, work, work, work."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"When you walk out, la-la-la-la-la-la."
01:34:37;01:34:41;"When the cat from out the door, door, door, door, door."
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Mm-mm-mm."
01:34:44;01:34:47;"It doesn't feel particularly cool to pick the number one"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"single of the moment, but Black Beatles by Ray Schremmer."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"It's also a great song."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Yes, they're on my list."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"It's funny to pick a song that at this point"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"has been memed so hard."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"That's why I can't-- it's just--"
01:34:57;01:35:00;"those videos drive me so crazy that I can't--"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"it like takes away from the song."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"I agree, but I'm taking-- I'm-- forget about the video."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"To me, that's another song where I think it's just--"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"it's great pop music."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"Like, it sticks in your head right away."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"It's not like it comes-- - Black Beatles in the city."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Yeah."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Conceptually, it's a brilliant song."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"Yeah, they're talented."

01:39:03;01:39:08;"Every song is kinda perfect, so many hits."
01:39:08;01:39:12;"But, you know, when I think about picturing,"
01:39:12;01:39:15;"I was thinking about this when I saw the Kanye and Trump"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"coming down in Trump Tower, and I was like,"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"I kind of had this weird feeling watching that footage"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"of them just kinda milling around."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"I was like, this looks like footage"
01:39:22;01:39:25;"from a documentary in five years."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Maybe like Adam Curtis, the BBC guy,"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"like somebody making like a creepy documentary"
01:39:28;01:39:32;"about like 2016, the year the world fell apart."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"You're associating it very specifically with 2016."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"I think it's great because to me,"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"it's kind of like a timeless pop song."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Like I feel like you're working on a new record."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"You could basically have made that,"
01:39:43;01:39:44;"I mean, obviously be you singing,"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"it'd be a little different, but you could make a record over--"
01:39:47;01:39:50;"Frat girl is a real crowd pleaser."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I think lyrically, subject matter"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"would be a little different and--"
01:39:53;01:39:54;"A tiny bit, yeah."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"The vocal delivery bit."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"But it would work for you, it's like,"
01:39:58;01:40:01;"it works for Jonah's debut album."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Actually, you know, Anthony Weiner"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"dropped a fire mixtape this year"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"that I think you guys are really like sleeping on."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"(laughing)"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"Debuts it in the documentary."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"All right, now I'm gonna say,"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"this is gonna be common ground or not common ground."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"Tribe called Quest, ""We the People."""
01:40:18;01:40:20;"- The song? - Yeah."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"- Oh, definitely. - I love it."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"I think everybody agrees."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"This could spur a whole different conversation"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"that Ezra and I had yesterday about that record."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"It's just awesome that they hadn't made a record in so long."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"And in hip-hop, it's not really that like,"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"not very commonplace."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Take 20 years off?"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"To take like 20 years off and be like,"
01:40:38;01:40:42;"someone who's not like 19 years old or 20 years old."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"To be like an adult artist,"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"take 20 years off and drop an album"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"and have it come out and people be that stoked"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"and do that well, you know?"

01:45:11;01:45:13;"I don't even know. You guys might have to play the audio."

01:45:22;01:45:25;"to launch his Facebook page to his fans,"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"and he says, ""Oh, yeah, there she is."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"That's it. Yeah."""
01:45:28;01:45:30;"It's a monster. It's so dope."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"When I think about things I wanna post--"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"- Wait for it. - I wanna post cool stuff."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Slick stuff. Neat stuff."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"[laughing]"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"The most stuff I wanna post is gonna be raw stuff like this."
01:45:38;01:45:41;"[laughing]"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"Garth Brooks likes it raw, people."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"So if this is truly a conversation,"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"then I say let the conversation--"
01:45:47;01:45:50;"Let the con-- let the conversation begin."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"[laughing]"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Just the voice he's doing is so weird."
01:45:54;01:45:57;"It's like real, like, Joker vibes."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Raw stuff."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Slick stuff. Neat stuff."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"But mostly raw stuff."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"[laughing]"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Or in my case, the hotel room."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"I really like that."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"[laughing]"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"That is-- okay, that's a YouTube video"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"probably from 2014."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Yeah, that's my track of the year."
01:46:15;01:46:18;"That is-- yo, someone has to sample that,"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"like how they did that, like, Will Ferrell thing"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"in, like, Watch the Throne."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Oh, it's just the song cuts out."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"It just cuts out in the middle."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"It's just like, ""Mostly it's gonna be raw stuff."""
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And then the beat drops back in."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"Let the conversation begin."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"[laughing]"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Let the conversation-- yeah."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"But why is it there's something with the voice?"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"It's the creepiest thing in the entire world."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Let the conversation--"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"It's like Supervillain."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"I really like that."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"[laughing]"
01:46:45;01:46:48;"Mostly it's gonna be raw stuff."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"[laughing]"
01:46:49;01:46:52;"It's like, ""Uh, Garth, what's up, homie?"""
01:46:52;01:46:53;"What are you doing?"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"Garth's been getting in a lot of red tube."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"[laughing]"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"Oh, man."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Yeah, he like--"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"Put a lot in his hotel room."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Slick stuff, for sure."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"[laughing]"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"All right."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"Oh, I got nothing to have Garth Brooks gunning for me."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"That was not good."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Yo, man, tell him to bring it."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"Shout out, Garth. He's a legend."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"We love your music, man."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"Yo, that's--"
01:47:16;01:47:17;"No disrespect."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"No, no, no."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"No, no, no, no, no, no."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"I said that's the most fire track this year."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"That's true."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"He did finish his whole episode out."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"Thank you, Garth."
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Holiday edition."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"All right, Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Slick stuff."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Garth Brooks comes out on top, people."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"I mean, number one."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"That's right."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"Right there."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"As always."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"That was something-- number one in 2016"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"was something that he probably didn't even release this year."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"He really liked that."
01:47:41;01:47:44;"[laughing]"
01:47:44;01:47:48;"Yo, Mike D, thank you for supporting Trump."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Always in your music since back in the day."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"I'm out since 1989."
01:47:52;01:47:55;"All right, just to clarify."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Listen to Johnny Rial."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"You can hear Mike D support Trump early days."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Peace."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Paul's Boutique in the iTunes store."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Check it out."
01:48:02;01:48:05;"Am I allowed to give you a compliment?"
01:48:05;01:48:08;"[laughing]"
01:48:08;01:48:12;"After dragging me through the mud, I was surprised."
01:48:12;01:48:16;"Because it was all a bit, and I love Paul's Boutique."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"Classic."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"That's the classic."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"My second favorite Beastie Boys album."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Can you guess my first?"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"I mean, like, the obvious would be License to Ill,"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"but I'm going to say no, because A, you would have been too"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"young, and B, that would be too obvious."
01:48:28;01:48:31;"What video did Spike send you of me rapping?"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"Oh, wait, so ""What You Want,"" right?"
01:48:33;01:48:34;"No."
01:48:34;01:48:38;"Professor Booty, off the album, ""Check Your Head."""
01:48:38;01:48:40;"Yeah, well, I was going to say ""Check Your Head"" was going"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"to be where I was going to go."
01:48:41;01:48:44;"But that's also because of the time of when you were"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"dropping, when you were skating."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"Yes."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"It's like what it meant to you in time."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"1,000%."
01:48:50;01:48:54;"I might be more of an ill communication guy."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"OK."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"I'm more of a guard--"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"But again, but maybe, I feel like Princeton Record"
01:48:58;01:49:01;"Exchange, that could have been a time and place thing."
01:49:01;01:49:04;"--a little older, and also, to tie it all back,"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"Q-Tips on that album."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Yeah, true."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"That's true."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"He has veterans in the game."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"Which Garth Brooks song--"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"And Donald Trump."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"--which Beastie song would you have Garth Brooks feature,"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"and which Vampire Weekend song would you"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"have Garth Brooks feature?"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Garth Brooks from the Facebook post?"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"Yeah, just spoken word."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"OK, spoken word."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"Break."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"I feel like that would be good, and I mean,"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"it's so ripe for sampling."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"There's so many--"
01:49:26;01:49:26;"Any song."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Please."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Any hip hop people."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"The raw stuff, I mean, there's so much good."
