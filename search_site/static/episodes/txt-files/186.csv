01:16;01:19;"- Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:23;"Well, it's been an eventful two weeks."
01:23;01:24;"Jake, how you doing?"
01:24;01:27;"- I'm pretty much back to normal,"
01:27;01:29;"but it's been a real rollercoaster."
01:29;01:31;"Had COVID."
01:31;01:33;"First time I've tested positive."
01:33;01:35;"- Finally got COVID."
01:35;01:36;"How strange."
01:36;01:37;"- Yeah, right?"
01:37;01:41;"I've been living like it's 2019 for a long time."
01:41;01:45;"I don't know, yeah, I got COVID."
01:45;01:47;"I think I maybe got it at the Cheesecake Factory"
01:47;01:50;"or during a screening of the film Tar,"
01:50;01:53;"which we talked about on the last show."
01:53;01:55;"I went to, I ate nachos with my brother"
01:55;01:57;"at the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale,"
01:57;01:59;"and then we went and saw Tar."
01:59;02:01;"So I guess when we recorded last,"
02:01;02:04;"I probably contracted it."
02:04;02:05;"- You were incubating."
02:05;02:08;"- About to show symptoms the next day."
02:08;02:10;"And then we had a big Mountain Brews record release show"
02:10;02:13;"booked for Friday, November 4th."
02:13;02:15;"And we practiced the weekend before,"
02:15;02:18;"and I had like a little scratch on my throat before practice."
02:18;02:20;"And I was like, ""Oh, I probably have a cold."""
02:20;02:21;"You know, especially with having a kid,"
02:21;02:24;"like I always have like some sort of like"
02:24;02:27;"low grade congestion, I feel like."
02:27;02:29;"And so I was like, ""Oh, you know,"
02:29;02:30;"""I didn't really think much of it."""
02:30;02:31;"And then like at the end of practice,"
02:31;02:34;"I was like, ""Oh man, I'm sick."""
02:34;02:37;"And then like felt like crap at home that night,"
02:37;02:40;"tested the next morning, sure enough, COVID."
02:40;02:42;"And there were seven people in Mountain Brews"
02:42;02:46;"and five of them ended up with COVID, thanks to me."
02:46;02:47;"- Damn."
02:47;02:50;"- I know, it was really a super spreader event."
02:50;02:52;"And so yeah, it canceled the show."
02:52;02:53;"You know, the show was good."
02:53;02:55;"Yeah, we were like all still kind of sick"
02:55;02:56;"by the time the show rolled around"
02:56;02:59;"and there was just no way we were gonna do it."
02:59;03:00;"- So much to unpack there."
03:00;03:01;"Let's start at the top."
03:01;03:04;"So Cheesecake Factory."
03:04;03:05;"- Yeah."
03:05;03:08;"- What's the decision-making process in hitting Cheesecake?"
03:08;03:10;"- Well, if we were partying like it was 2019,"
03:10;03:12;"we would have gone to the Arclight"
03:12;03:15;"in Pasadena or Hollywood."
03:15;03:18;"But the Arclight is no longer."
03:18;03:19;"- It's closed."
03:19;03:21;"- It's a casualty of the COVID era."
03:21;03:23;"So now if you wanna see like a cool,"
03:23;03:25;"arty, tasteful movie like ""Tar,"""
03:25;03:29;"you're gonna end up at the Glendale Americana."
03:29;03:30;"Which is still showing a lot of like-"
03:30;03:31;"- Which is a huge-"
03:31;03:33;"- Yeah, it's still showing the MCU and all that,"
03:33;03:35;"you know, ""Top Gun."""
03:35;03:36;"- And for people who don't know,"
03:36;03:41;"the Glendale Americana is like a huge outdoor mall complex."
03:41;03:42;"- Yeah, it was-"
03:42;03:44;"- With living arrangements."
03:44;03:45;"- With living arrangements."
03:45;03:48;"Oh yeah, Nick, I saw a movie with Nick there once."
03:48;03:53;"It's very LA in the sense that most of the country"
03:53;03:58;"doesn't have these like year-round outdoor places."
03:58;03:59;"You have your kind of like classic,"
03:59;04:03;"like East Coast, Midwestern, just like brutal mall,"
04:03;04:06;"just like concrete spaceship that you like pull up to."
04:06;04:08;"Everything's happening inside."
04:08;04:11;"But I don't know how many places have these."
04:11;04:14;"It's, yeah, a mixed-use development"
04:14;04:19;"that's kind of modeled after a European city."
04:19;04:21;"- Yeah, kind of Vegas-y or like Disneyland-y."
04:21;04:25;"It's actually developed by Rick Caruso, who is-"
04:25;04:26;"- Potentially the mayor."
04:26;04:28;"- Yeah, he's in a, I guess they're counting the votes."
04:28;04:29;"- In a dead heat."
04:29;04:32;"- Yeah, but yeah, it's kind of what you're saying."
04:32;04:36;"There's fountains, there's sidewalks."
04:36;04:37;"- Sidewalks, there's a fence happening."
04:37;04:39;"- There's like a little mini train track"
04:39;04:41;"that the kids can ride on."
04:41;04:42;"- Yeah, and then there's apartment buildings."
04:42;04:45;"And when you come, you see all these like memes"
04:45;04:47;"and stuff these days where people talk about"
04:47;04:50;"how sad they are that America doesn't have"
04:50;04:53;"high-density walkable cities."
04:53;04:54;"(laughing)"
04:54;04:55;"- I've never been to the Americana."
04:55;04:58;"- There's memes where kind of,"
04:58;05:01;"I guess people who are into like urbanism,"
05:01;05:04;"they'll point out how people have such fond memories."
05:04;05:05;"I remember a specific meme"
05:05;05:07;"where they were listing all these things"
05:07;05:10;"that a typical kind of like middle-class American"
05:10;05:13;"might say, these are such special moments in my life."
05:13;05:17;"And they'll talk about, wow, I really liked college."
05:17;05:21;"It was great, I was in a building with all my friends,"
05:21;05:26;"walk out the door, go to our communal dining hall,"
05:26;05:28;"walk elsewhere to do everything I had to do,"
05:28;05:31;"spend time together in the quad or whatever."
05:31;05:32;"That's like a fond memory"
05:32;05:36;"that a lot of college-educated Americans have."
05:36;05:38;"And the meme was like, yeah,"
05:38;05:41;"'cause you were in a dense walkable environment."
05:41;05:42;"And then the other examples they give"
05:42;05:44;"that people have fond memories of in America,"
05:44;05:45;"like, you know what I love?"
05:45;05:47;"I love going to Disneyland with my family."
05:47;05:49;"We go as often as we can."
05:49;05:50;"There's people who go twice a year,"
05:50;05:52;"but there's plenty of people who like,"
05:52;05:53;"if they have a vacation time, they go there."
05:53;05:55;"And then the meme is saying, yeah, again,"
05:55;05:58;"it's you're in a dense walkable environment."
05:58;06:00;"You're at your hotel, pop downstairs,"
06:00;06:02;"walk across the street, no cars,"
06:02;06:05;"hit the restaurant, hit the cafe,"
06:05;06:08;"or maybe they went to Europe on vacation once."
06:08;06:10;"Like, man, it was so charming"
06:10;06:13;"being in this little city in Italy."
06:13;06:15;"And basically they're saying over and over again,"
06:15;06:20;"what you're looking for is a dense walkable environment."
06:20;06:25;"And people famously say LA is like the antithesis of that,"
06:25;06:27;"but they gotta go to the Americana"
06:27;06:29;"because that's where,"
06:29;06:31;"if you lived in one of the apartments there,"
06:31;06:33;"you would come downstairs"
06:33;06:35;"and you would be on this funny little street"
06:35;06:39;"where you could go sit at a restaurant."
06:39;06:41;"You'd walk right across the street, no cars."
06:41;06:43;"It's maybe a little bit eerie."
06:43;06:45;"It's definitely a Truman Show vibe,"
06:45;06:48;"but beggars can't be choosers."
06:48;06:53;"Your soul chose to be incarnated in 21st century America,"
06:53;06:57;"not 19th century Italy, so that's on you."
06:57;07:00;"If it's a little weird, it is what it is,"
07:00;07:02;"but you walk downstairs and here you are."
07:02;07:04;"Your kids can ride a funny little train."
07:04;07:05;"You can go sit by the fountain"
07:05;07:08;"and you can walk right over to see a movie, for instance."
07:08;07:10;"- Or you could pop by the Cheesecake Factory"
07:10;07:12;"for a quick brew."
07:12;07:14;"You know, that's your local watering hole."
07:14;07:15;"- Right, exactly."
07:15;07:17;"If you're too much of an aesthete,"
07:17;07:18;"it might not measure up."
07:18;07:21;"You're not having a cool old Italian bar"
07:21;07:22;"where everybody's hanging out,"
07:22;07:27;"but it's, you know, Cheesecake Factory, extensive menu."
07:27;07:30;"And you post up, have your beer, meet up with some friends."

08:28;08:32;"live in the apartments who have like,"
08:32;08:36;"a standing like 5.30 PM beer at Cheesecake."
08:36;08:38;"- For sure."
08:38;08:38;"I thought you were gonna say-"
08:38;08:39;"- That's gonna be us."
08:39;08:40;"(laughing)"
08:40;08:41;"- I thought you were gonna say,"
08:41;08:43;"have like a standing tab, like,"
08:43;08:44;"""Hey, put it on my tab."""
08:44;08:46;"- Oh, is it like a really good relationship with the-"
08:46;08:49;"- Yeah, with the management of the Cheesecake Factory."
08:49;08:52;"- Oh yeah, you know I'm good for it, of course."
08:52;08:55;"- I'm wondering, I'm trying to find if there's anyone"
08:55;08:58;"who's, not that they've never left the Americana,"
08:58;09:01;"but has, you know, done some kind of experiment."
09:01;09:04;"Like, I spent a full year living in the Americana"
09:04;09:07;"and I never left its walls."
09:07;09:09;"- Oh, like Super Seismic for the Americana?"
09:09;09:11;"- Yeah, where it's like, they live there,"
09:11;09:13;"then they go eat there, have a beer"
09:13;09:15;"at the Cheesecake Factory."
09:15;09:17;"I assume there's no-"
09:17;09:20;"- There's other restaurants, there's a non-Chain Italian."
09:20;09:22;"- There's an Italian place I've eaten at."
09:22;09:23;"- I've eaten there too."
09:23;09:24;"It's pretty good."
09:24;09:28;"- It's a non-Chain, or maybe it's covertly a Chain."
09:28;09:29;"- Right."
09:29;09:30;"- So yeah, that's the backstory."
09:30;09:33;"I mean, it was basically like, let's go see ""Tar."""
09:33;09:35;"It's playing in Glendale."
09:35;09:39;"Let's like grab a brew and eat some nachos"
09:39;09:41;"at the Cheesecake Factory, which is just catty corner."
09:41;09:43;"- There are no better options than cheesecake?"
09:43;09:46;"Or you guys kind of liked to hit cheesecake?"
09:46;09:48;"- This is the first time I've done this with my brother."
09:48;09:51;"I've been to that cheesecake a couple of times"
09:51;09:52;"before a movie."
09:52;09:56;"Just 'cause it's, I'm not gonna like park twice."
09:56;09:58;"Like, it's either like the Cheesecake Factory"
09:58;10:00;"or that Italian place."
10:00;10:02;"Maybe there's one other place, I forget."
10:02;10:04;"But it's like, you know, classic,"
10:04;10:09;"like semi-ironic Cheesecake Factory outing."
10:09;10:10;"- Right."
10:10;10:11;"- And plus I was working on a painting"
10:11;10:13;"of a Cheesecake Factory at the time."
10:13;10:14;"- Oh, perfect."
10:14;10:18;"- So I liked the spiritual symmetry of that."
10:18;10:21;"Just for the purposes of my own personal mythology"
10:21;10:24;"and narrative, it's fitting that I would get COVID"
10:24;10:26;"at the Cheesecake Factory."
10:26;10:29;"- And especially as you're working on the painting."
10:29;10:30;"- It was Cheesecake's revenge."
10:30;10:35;"- Cheesecake's revenge on Jake's immune system."
10:35;10:36;"And now you always remember it"
10:36;10:40;"because I hope obviously that COVID"
10:40;10:42;"becomes less of a talking point in the years to come"
10:42;10:44;"because it will just be less of a thing."
10:44;10:46;"But there'll be conversations for the rest of our lives"
10:46;10:48;"where people say, ""Remember COVID?"
10:48;10:49;"""Did you get it?"
10:49;10:51;"""Where'd you get it?"""
10:51;10:54;"And Jake will, ""Mine's not that interesting."
10:54;10:56;"""Yeah, I just got it at home."
10:56;10:58;"""My son got it for whatever."""
10:58;10:59;"You know, like, ""Just got it."""
10:59;11:01;"Whereas Jake's is gonna be--"
11:01;11:02;"- The stuff of legend."
11:02;11:04;"- I got it at Cheesecake Factory"
11:04;11:06;"while I was working on a Cheesecake Factory painting"
11:06;11:10;"before I went to see the film ""Tar."""
11:10;11:11;"And they'll say, ""Whoa, really?"""
11:11;11:15;"And say, ""And by the way, did you know that Todd Field,"
11:15;11:19;"""the director of 'Tar,' may have invented Big League Chew?"""
11:19;11:21;"It's gonna be the perfect dinner party conversation"
11:21;11:25;"for Jake in his 70s living at the Americana."
11:25;11:25;"- I dropped--"
11:25;11:27;"- I got it in this very Cheesecake Factory"
11:27;11:29;"where I have dinner every night."
11:29;11:31;"- Someone, literally someone says, ""Oh yeah, I once got,"
11:31;11:33;"""you ever get COVID?"""
11:33;11:38;"Two hours later, Jake's telling them about Todd Field."
11:38;11:40;"- Yeah."
11:40;11:44;"I did drop the Todd Field co-created Big League Chew"
11:44;11:47;"factoid in a text thread last night."
11:47;11:52;"And it always elicits incredible surprise from people."
11:52;11:54;"The whole text thread was just like, ""Wait, what?"""
11:54;11:57;"- I put out a few Hollywood feelers, by the way."
11:57;11:58;"- On Todd Field?"
11:58;12:00;"- I haven't figured anything out, I'll put it that way."
12:00;12:02;"But I thought of a few people I knew"
12:02;12:04;"who might know people who knew him."
12:04;12:05;"- Yeah."
12:05;12:06;"- And I was just like hitting people up like,"
12:06;12:11;"""Can you ask this person, do you mind reaching out?"""
12:11;12:13;"(laughing)"
12:13;12:14;"Just a friend of a friend,"
12:14;12:18;"""Do you mind reaching out to Tarantino?"""
12:18;12:20;"Are they buddies, kind of similar?"
12:20;12:24;"But I found one guy who might know him and he said,"
12:24;12:26;"""I don't know the answer to that story,"
12:26;12:28;"""but if I reconnect with him at any point"
12:28;12:31;"""in the next few months, I'll feel it out."""
12:31;12:33;"But I did a little more research on that too."
12:33;12:36;"And the one thing I can say without repeating"
12:36;12:39;"our whole live bombshell investigation we did last time"
12:39;12:44;"is that whatever his name was, Nelson, the pitcher,"
12:44;12:45;"- Yeah. - who started it,"
12:45;12:48;"all I can say for sure is having read a little more deeply"
12:48;12:51;"is that his story has changed a bit."
12:51;12:54;"At various points, he's kind of said that Todd Field"
12:54;12:57;"was holding a bag of chopped up licorice"
12:57;12:58;"and that gave him the idea."
12:58;13:00;"And in other interviews, he said,"
13:00;13:04;"""Oh yeah, Todd Field, he was our bat boy, sweet kid."
13:04;13:07;"""I didn't have a kitchen, so actually I made the first batch"
13:07;13:11;"""at his mom's house, but I'd had the idea"
13:11;13:15;"""to do chopped up chewing gum since I was a kid."""
13:15;13:16;"So it's totally different stories."
13:16;13:17;"- Psychotic."
13:17;13:19;"- One day we'll get to the bottom of it,"
13:19;13:21;"but I'm increasingly feeling like Todd Field"
13:21;13:23;"is not a secret billionaire."
13:23;13:25;"So go out and see the film ""Tar"" by the way,"
13:25;13:28;"because the guy does not have big league chew money."
13:28;13:30;"Anybody who's staying home saying,"
13:30;13:34;"""I'll torrent the film 'Tar', I won't see it in theaters."
13:34;13:37;"""Todd Field, he's got that big league chew money."
13:37;13:39;"""He doesn't need my money at the box office."""
13:39;13:41;"I don't think it's true."
13:41;13:44;"And I'm sorry if I gave that impression two weeks ago."
13:44;13:45;"If you're interested in the film"
13:45;13:49;"and you wanna support Todd Field, get your butt in a seat."

14:00;14:03;"I don't think this man is a secret billionaire."
14:03;14:07;"So any kind of antipathy you have towards the mega rich,"
14:07;14:10;"do not project that onto Todd Field."

14:58;15:00;"You know, I could have got it at ""Tar""."

15:45;15:48;"that Hannah actually knows a little bit, who's from Texas."
15:48;15:50;"Anyway, they put out this record."
15:50;15:52;"Okay, no, I have heard of that, yeah."
15:52;15:53;"It's real like kind of like trio."
15:53;15:56;"Remember that record with Dolly Parton and Emmylou"
15:56;15:59;"and Linda Ronstadt in the '80s called ""Trio""?"
15:59;16:00;"Yeah."
16:00;16:02;"It's like they wrote a bunch of really great songs"
16:02;16:03;"and they performed them"
16:03;16:07;"in this very straightforward, sonorous way."
16:07;16:09;"And actually, they had this guy, Eric Slick,"
16:09;16:11;"playing drums for them,"
16:11;16:15;"who actually played drums in the last ""Mountain Brews"" EP,"

17:26;17:28;"none of these people got COVID."
17:28;17:30;"- Correct, I was the only one."
17:30;17:33;"- Okay, well, I mean, I'm sorry for you,"
17:33;17:35;"but that feels like kind of good news"
17:35;17:37;"that didn't spread like wildfire,"
17:37;17:40;"except at bruise practice, maybe 'cause you were singing."
17:40;17:42;"Maybe because you guys were sharing one mic"
17:42;17:44;"singing four-part harmonies."
17:44;17:49;"- No, but we were in a closed room for four hours singing."
17:49;17:51;"Somehow I didn't give it to Hannah, which is amazing,"
17:51;17:53;"but yeah, you're probably right."
17:53;17:56;"Probably the singing, and I was probably right at like,"
17:56;17:59;"I was probably peaking in my contagion right at that,"
17:59;18:01;"like that day, you know?"
18:01;18:06;"But we are playing Friday, November 18th"
18:06;18:10;"as part of a ""Jokerman"" podcast live event at Gold Diggers."
18:10;18:12;"So- - Well, that'll be great."
18:12;18:15;"- That's kind of turned into our record release."
18:15;18:16;"- Oh, perfect."
18:16;18:17;"- Yeah, we're gonna play at like seven,"
18:17;18:20;"and then ""Jokerman"" are gonna hit the stage."
18:20;18:23;"I think I'm gonna be joining them for some of it"
18:23;18:25;"about a discussion, or there'll be a discussion"
18:25;18:29;"about Bob Dylan's new book, ""The Philosophy of Modern Song."""
18:29;18:31;"- Right, maybe we should talk about the book a little bit."
18:31;18:32;"- Yeah."
18:32;18:35;"- I only read the first few songs, but-"
18:35;18:36;"- Yeah."
18:36;18:36;"- Have you finished it, Jake?"
18:36;18:38;"- No, I'm like, I don't know,"
18:38;18:39;"maybe a third of the way through."
18:39;18:41;"- Well, so for anybody who doesn't know,"
18:41;18:43;"Bob Dylan just released this book,"
18:43;18:45;"""The Philosophy of Modern Song."""
18:45;18:47;"Just to put it in context,"
18:47;18:49;"if you don't follow Dylan closely,"
18:49;18:52;"he does get up to some weird, random, extracurricular stuff,"
18:52;18:55;"but it's not like he's releasing books all the time."
18:55;18:56;"Off the top of my head,"
18:56;18:59;"I'm aware of three books he's ever released."
18:59;19:04;"In the '60s, he wrote this kind of like surreal,"
19:04;19:08;"difficult to read, poetic novel called ""Tarantula,"""
19:08;19:11;"which seems a little bit like just at the peak,"
19:11;19:14;"famous '60s Dylan, he got a book contract,"
19:14;19:16;"and then he was like, ""Ah, (beep) I gotta write something."""
19:16;19:20;"Kind of like a post-Kerouac weirdo thing."
19:20;19:25;"But then outside of that, he wrote ""Chronicles"" volume one,"
19:25;19:30;"which was a very interesting impressionistic memoir volume."
19:30;19:35;"And that was already like 20 years ago."
19:35;19:36;"It kind of seemed like he was setting it up"
19:36;19:38;"that, ""Oh man, every few years,"
19:38;19:41;"are we gonna get a new part of Bob Dylan's memoirs?"""
19:41;19:43;"'Cause that first part really jumped around."
19:43;19:45;"It was a bit of early life,"
19:45;19:49;"then a bit of the making of ""Oh Mercy"" in the late '80s."
19:49;19:50;"And then that's been it."
19:50;19:53;"So it is pretty eventful for a Dylan fan"
19:53;19:55;"that he's written a new book."
19:55;19:57;"And it just so happens that this one"
19:57;20:02;"is a bit of music journalism, criticism, I guess you'd say."
20:02;20:04;"He chose how many songs?"
20:04;20:06;"- I think 66."
20:06;20:08;"- 66 songs."
20:08;20:13;"And he basically wrote a mini essay about each one"
20:13;20:15;"where he kind of explains"
20:15;20:17;"what he thinks is going on in the song."
20:17;20:19;"He kind of has his own poetic,"
20:19;20:22;"impressionistic language about it."
20:22;20:24;"Talks a bit about the songwriter,"
20:24;20:27;"but it's pretty like stream of consciousness."
20:27;20:28;"It's not like it opens where it's like,"
20:28;20:29;"""Hey guys, Bob Dylan here."
20:29;20:32;"I've dedicated my life to song craft."
20:32;20:36;"And I wanna take you through a journey of modern music."""
20:36;20:39;"And by doing it, I chose 66 songs that I think"
20:39;20:42;"really tell a story about America,"
20:42;20:44;"about art, and about my inspiration."
20:44;20:45;"It's not like that at all."
20:45;20:48;"It's like you just kind of drop in and it's just like."
20:48;20:50;"- Yeah, I mean, you could read it completely out of order."
20:50;20:52;"You could just jump around in the book,"
20:52;20:55;"just read chapters, you know, willy nilly."
20:55;20:58;"And actually, but as we're saying in the intro of the book,"
20:58;21:00;"he does make a dedication."
21:00;21:01;"This is very TC."
21:01;21:04;"He dedicates the book to all the crew at Duncan."
21:04;21:05;"- Yes."
21:05;21:07;"- Is that the Westlake Village Duncan?"
21:07;21:08;"I don't think there's a Duncan in Malibu."
21:08;21:11;"He's thanking all these people,"
21:11;21:12;"seemingly people he works with."
21:12;21:14;"Oh, who knows who these other people are?"
21:14;21:18;"Eddie Gorodetsky, Sal and Jeremy, the Hot Rod Kings."
21:18;21:19;"(laughs)"
21:19;21:22;"And all the crew at Duncan Donuts,"
21:22;21:24;"P.K. Ferguson and Jonathan Karp."
21:24;21:26;"Yeah, all the crew at Duncan Donuts."
21:26;21:26;"I mean."
21:26;21:28;"- Well, he's a road dog, you know."
21:28;21:30;"- Yeah, he probably means all the hardworking people"
21:30;21:33;"at Duncan Donuts across this great nation."
21:33;21:34;"- Yeah."
21:34;21:35;"- He just jumps right in."
21:35;21:36;"- Yeah."
21:36;21:38;"- Chapter one, Detroit City, Bobby Bear."
21:38;21:39;"In this song, you're the prodigal son."
21:39;21:41;"You went to sleep last night in Detroit City."
21:41;21:42;"- Yeah."
21:42;21:43;"- You're in."
21:43;21:44;"- You know, it's crazy."
21:44;21:46;"Bobby Bear Jr. is the rhythm guitarist"
21:46;21:49;"in the current lineup of Guided By Voices."
21:49;21:50;"- Really?"
21:50;21:50;"- Yeah."
21:50;21:53;"Bobby Bear Jr. is probably like 55."
21:53;21:54;"- That's deep."
21:54;21:55;"I remember when-"
21:55;21:57;"- But there's a picture of Bobby Bear Sr."
21:57;22:00;"with presumably his wife and his kids."
22:00;22:02;"And that's like the kid in the photo"
22:02;22:04;"right in the first chapter of this book"
22:04;22:07;"is definitely, definitely looks like Bobby Bear Jr."
22:07;22:08;"Like in the 60s or 70s."
22:08;22:11;"- That'd be amazing if at the end of his little chapter"
22:11;22:13;"about the Bobby Bear song,"
22:13;22:17;"Dylan is so weird, you never know what he's up on"
22:17;22:19;"or if he like, ended up being like,"
22:19;22:22;"by the way, Bobby Bear's kid playing rhythm guitar"
22:22;22:26;"with an outfit out of Ohio, Guided By Voices."
22:26;22:27;"- Another Bob."
22:27;22:27;"- Also, he's checking out."
22:27;22:28;"(laughing)"
22:28;22:29;"- Another Bob."

23:32;23:35;"I recently found a website where you could listen"
23:35;23:39;"to an archive of Bob Dylan's radio show."
23:39;23:40;"- Oh, cool."
23:40;23:43;"- Because just like us, Bob Dylan, he's not a podcaster,"
23:43;23:47;"but he's also passionate about radio, just like the TC crew."
23:47;23:51;"And for at least a few years, he did a show,"
23:51;23:54;"I think it was for Sirius, called Theme Time Radio."
23:54;23:57;"And I would hear about it, I never actually heard it,"
23:57;24:00;"and I had no idea what it was really like,"
24:00;24:01;"you know, for all I knew it was just Bob"
24:01;24:03;"just picked a bunch of songs"
24:03;24:05;"and kind of like created a playlist or something."
24:05;24:06;"- Yeah."
24:06;24:07;"- That would have made sense."
24:07;24:09;"But then I actually listened to an episode."
24:09;24:10;"- There's a lot of talking."
24:10;24:11;"- There's a lot of talking,"
24:11;24:15;"and he really is enjoying being a DJ,"
24:15;24:18;"and not particularly playing the character of Bob Dylan,"
24:18;24:19;"but really just like being a DJ,"
24:19;24:21;"and this like kind of funny tone,"
24:21;24:24;"like the one I was listening to was, he was like,"
24:24;24:27;"""Well, everybody, perhaps you can't travel at the moment,"
24:27;24:29;"maybe you're working a job,"
24:29;24:31;"but I'm gonna take you all around the world"
24:31;24:33;"today on Theme Time Radio."
24:33;24:35;"The first stop, Switzerland."""
24:35;24:38;"And then he like played some song,"
24:38;24:42;"and he was like, ""Buckle your seat belts and get your ticket,"
24:42;24:45;"'cause now we're heading to the land of China."""
24:45;24:48;"This song written in 1932, it's just like that kind of vibe."
24:48;24:49;"- China."
24:49;24:52;"- The man is passionate about songs"
24:52;24:53;"and sharing it with the world."
24:53;24:55;"So yeah, after hearing the radio show,"
24:55;24:57;"it makes total sense that he would wanna write"
24:57;25:00;"just a book of criticism,"
25:00;25:03;"but it's not like he's giving you like clues,"
25:03;25:05;"like Bob Dylan's guide to songwriting,"
25:05;25:07;"""Here's what I love and how it affected me."""
25:07;25:11;"He puts very little energy, at least what I've seen,"
25:11;25:15;"into trying to like link it back to his own life or work."
25:15;25:17;"This is just him as a listener."
25:17;25:19;"- He's having fun, he's telling stories."
25:19;25:22;"I mean, there's great little anecdotes"
25:22;25:24;"about some of these characters"
25:24;25:26;"or people who are adjacent to them."
25:26;25:28;"There was that great story,"
25:28;25:29;"I don't know if you got to the part"
25:29;25:31;"about the guy who invented the nudie suit."
25:31;25:35;"It was like a refugee,"
25:35;25:39;"like a Jewish refugee from like Central Europe somewhere"
25:39;25:44;"who moved to New York and was designing clothes and stuff,"
25:44;25:46;"wardrobes for Broadway, and then he moved to Hollywood,"
25:46;25:49;"and he started making these like very garish,"
25:49;25:53;"sequined outfits that eventually people like Elvis"
25:53;25:55;"and stuff would wear, but a lot of those..."
25:55;25:58;"And then his name was, I don't have it in front of me,"
25:58;26:01;"but anyway, some sort of similar to Nudie,"
26:01;26:03;"and anyway, like his name was,"
26:03;26:06;"or like the name nudie suit is derivative of his name."
26:06;26:09;"- Of his name, ah, I always wondered where nudie came from."
26:09;26:10;"- What's that?"
26:10;26:12;"- Nudie Cohen, or Nudie Cohn."
26:12;26:13;"- Okay."
26:13;26:17;"And there's this whole thing about how Grant Parsons"
26:17;26:19;"had approached him and was like,"
26:19;26:22;"""Wouldn't it be crazy if you put like marijuana leaves"
26:22;26:24;"on a nudie suit?"""
26:24;26:26;"Bob Dylan has such a way with,"
26:26;26:27;"it's not like a dig at Grant Parsons,"
26:27;26:28;"but he was sort of like, he's like,"
26:28;26:30;"""Well, you know, Grant Parsons,"
26:30;26:31;"he thought he was from the generation"
26:31;26:33;"that invented drug use."""
26:33;26:36;"So he thought he would scandalize Nudie"
26:36;26:39;"with asking him to put weed leaves on the suit."
26:39;26:40;"But Nudie, of course, is just a pragmatist."
26:40;26:42;"He was just like, ""Yeah, sure, what's the big deal?"
26:42;26:43;"I'll do that."""
26:43;26:45;"'Cause like, you know, then on the cover"
26:45;26:48;"of that Flying Burrito Brothers record,"
26:48;26:51;"Grant Parsons is wearing this amazing nudie suit"
26:51;26:53;"with the marijuana leaves all over it."
26:53;26:54;"- Ah, right."
26:54;26:56;"- But you know, that's just like two or three paragraphs"
26:56;26:57;"in this book, and then he's moving on."
26:57;27:00;"I mean, there's tons of like really interesting,"
27:00;27:03;"fun asides."
27:03;27:06;"I was reading, well, there's two songs in here"
27:06;27:08;"from Bobby Darin."
27:08;27:11;"Do you have much of a relationship with Bobby Darin, Ezra?"
27:11;27:13;"- As a matter of fact, I do."
27:13;27:17;"I don't know if I've talked about it on the show much,"
27:17;27:21;"but there's this period, I think I was on vacation."
27:21;27:23;"I must've mentioned this once or twice."
27:23;27:25;"I was on vacation a few years back"
27:25;27:26;"with a fun group of people,"
27:26;27:27;"including some friends of the show,"
27:27;27:31;"like Despot, Ariel Rekshide."
27:31;27:34;"At some point, I think it was Ariel,"
27:34;27:36;"he just started talking about the song ""Splish Splash,"""
27:36;27:38;"and he said, I don't know if he was doing this"
27:38;27:42;"as like a kind of like fun fact type thing,"
27:42;27:44;"but he was kind of like, ""Hey, everybody, real quick,"
27:44;27:44;"off the top of your head,"
27:44;27:47;"what are the opening lines of 'Splish Splash'?"""
27:47;27:48;"- I kind of remember this."
27:48;27:50;"- Everybody was like, ""Do you kind of remember this?"""
27:50;27:52;"- Maybe I talked about it on the show."
27:52;27:56;"Enough time has passed that we can bring it back."
27:56;27:57;"But so everybody was thinking like,"
27:57;27:59;"""Well, yeah, 'Splish Splash,' I was taking a bath"
27:59;28:02;"since on a Saturday night."""
28:02;28:05;"And then you start really trying to get into that line."
28:05;28:07;"You couldn't quite remember."
28:07;28:09;"""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"
28:09;28:11;"once upon a Saturday night."
28:11;28:12;"Splish Splash, I was taking a bath,"
28:12;28:13;"must've been a Saturday."""
28:13;28:15;"You try to start thinking about"
28:15;28:17;"what would actually make sense in that line."
28:17;28:20;"And then he said, ""No, no, it's 'Splish Splash,'"
28:20;28:24;"I was taking a bath all about a Saturday night."""
28:24;28:25;"I actually, it's a sign for,"
28:25;28:27;"you fact check me as I say this,"
28:27;28:28;"'cause even now- - It's ""long about,"""
28:28;28:30;"""long about a Saturday night."""
28:30;28:32;"- Oh, ""long about a Saturday night."""
28:32;28:34;"""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"
28:34;28:36;"long about a Saturday night."""
28:36;28:39;"So then it became this whole conversation about it,"
28:39;28:43;"because I guess that's just like a totally archaic phrase."
28:43;28:46;"It must've been common in the '50s and early '60s,"
28:46;28:50;"but the ""long about,"" I guess means just like,"
28:50;28:52;"that's when it happened."
28:52;28:53;"- ""Long about"" definition,"
28:53;28:56;"approximately at the time or date of,"
28:56;28:57;"and the example here is,"
28:57;29:00;"""Long about my third cup of coffee,"
29:00;29:02;"I started to feel too jittery to sit at my desk."""
29:02;29:04;"(laughing)"
29:04;29:06;"- It was approximately Saturday night"
29:06;29:07;"when I was taking a bath."
29:07;29:08;"- Did you hear back yet?"
29:08;29:11;"Well, I texted him long about 9 a.m.,"
29:11;29:14;"so maybe we'll get an answer by this afternoon."
29:14;29:15;"- Yeah, you should start using that"
29:15;29:18;"and see if people are like, ""What did you say?"""
29:18;29:21;"- Yeah, just pure linguistic gaslighting."
29:21;29:23;"Somebody's like, ""I've never heard that phrase."
29:23;29:24;"That sounds really weird."""
29:24;29:26;"I'd be like, ""What the (beep) are you talking about?"
29:26;29:28;"Throw on 'Splish Splash' by Bobby Darin right now."
29:28;29:30;"Are you crazy?"
29:30;29:31;"Throw on the famous, iconic song,"
29:31;29:33;"'Splish Splash' by Bobby Darin."
29:33;29:34;"It's the opening lines,"
29:34;29:36;"and you're telling me you don't know this phrase?"
29:36;29:37;"No, you're weird."
29:37;29:40;"It's weird that you don't say ""long about."""
29:40;29:42;"It's a very common phrase."
29:42;29:43;"It's widely used."
29:43;29:45;"But anyway, something about that,"
29:45;29:46;"""Long about"" a Saturday night,"
29:46;29:49;"then we started talking about Bobby Darin a lot,"
29:49;29:51;"and then we watched the infamous film,"
29:51;29:54;"""Beyond the Sea,"" starring Kevin Spacey."
29:54;29:57;"- What is that like, that movie?"
29:57;29:58;"- You would love it."
29:58;29:58;"It's insane."
29:58;30:00;"- I gotta watch it. - Famously,"
30:00;30:03;"there's parts of it that are normal enough."
30:03;30:05;"It's kind of a good overview of Bobby Darin's life,"
30:05;30:06;"but just no matter what,"
30:06;30:09;"there's always gonna be this eerie quality to it"
30:09;30:11;"because famously, Kevin Spacey"
30:11;30:15;"insisted on playing Bobby Darin throughout his whole life."
30:15;30:17;"And Kevin Spacey at the time,"
30:17;30:19;"you know, he just looked however old he was."
30:19;30:21;"He really looked like a middle-aged guy."
30:21;30:23;"He looked about 50."
30:23;30:26;"So he's playing Bobby Darin as this young, teeny bopper."
30:26;30:28;"It's just like, you just don't buy it."
30:28;30:29;"It doesn't make any sense."
30:29;30:33;"- He's playing 19-year-old Bobby Darin."
30:33;30:33;"- Yeah."
30:33;30:37;"- Bobby Darin died when he was 37, it should be noted."
30:37;30:38;"- Whoa, yeah, yeah."
30:38;30:40;"I think he was literally already older"
30:40;30:41;"than Bobby Darin had been when he died."
30:41;30:43;"So it's very strange."
30:43;30:44;"And there are these like really kind of like"
30:44;30:48;"cheesy musical moments where he's dancing and stuff."
30:48;30:49;"But anyway, I still learned a lot"
30:49;30:51;"about Bobby Darin's life that way,"
30:51;30:52;"and it stayed with me."
30:52;30:54;"So yeah, I do."
30:54;30:56;"I've thought about Bobby Darin quite a bit."
30:56;30:58;"And he did have a really interesting career"
30:58;31:00;"because my understanding is that"
31:00;31:04;"he was a tri-state area Italian guy."
31:04;31:06;"I don't know exactly where he was from."
31:06;31:09;"- Born in Harlem, but I'm not really sure where he grew up."
31:09;31:10;"- Oh, born in Harlem."
31:10;31:11;"Interesting."
31:11;31:12;"- Yeah."
31:12;31:14;"- And my understanding was that he was a guy"
31:14;31:16;"who just wanted to be the next Sinatra."
31:16;31:17;"- Yeah."
31:17;31:20;"- And he wanted to be like a classic"
31:20;31:22;"Italian-American crooner."
31:22;31:24;"And he eventually got there,"
31:24;31:26;"but first, as you often see,"
31:26;31:28;"he had to find just some way to break in"
31:28;31:30;"to the music industry."
31:30;31:33;"And so he made this kind of novelty hit, ""Splish Splash,"""
31:33;31:35;"but that wasn't the real Bobby."
31:35;31:39;"The real Bobby was more in his rendition of ""Mac the Knife."""
31:39;31:41;"So I feel like she tracked me on this."
31:41;31:43;"""Splish Splash"" was before ""Mac the Knife."""
31:43;31:45;"Maybe we should be listening to some of these."
31:45;31:47;"- I made a mini Bobby Darin,"
31:47;31:49;"well, like a two or three song Bobby Darin playlist"
31:49;31:50;"I want us to go on."
31:50;31:52;"- Can we kick it off with ""Splish Splash"" first?"
31:52;31:53;"- Yeah."
31:53;31:55;"Well, I thought ""Bobby Darin"" was so interesting."
31:55;31:59;"Like, I want to just read really quickly from the Bob book."
31:59;32:00;"'Cause the thing that,"
32:00;32:03;"I have a memory of knowing ""Mac the Knife"" when I was a kid"
32:03;32:04;"and knowing ""Splish Splash"""
32:04;32:06;"and not realizing it was the same guy."
32:06;32:09;"But then he also had a hit later of the Tim Harden song,"
32:09;32:11;"""If I Was a Carpenter."""
32:11;32:12;"- He became kind of a hippie."
32:12;32:13;"- He became,"
32:13;32:15;"and I want to really dive into that in a little bit,"
32:15;32:18;"but we'll work our way up to that."
32:18;32:21;"But his sound is so all over the place."
32:21;32:23;"And so Bob's writing about that and he goes,"
32:23;32:27;"""Bobby Darin could sound like anyone or sing any style."
32:27;32:30;"""He was more flexible than anyone of his time."
32:30;32:31;"""He could be Harry Belafonte."
32:31;32:32;"""He could be Elvis."
32:32;32:33;"""He could be Dion."
32:33;32:35;"""He could be a Calypso singer."
32:35;32:38;"""He could be a bluegrass singer or a folk singer."
32:38;32:40;"""He was a rhythm and blues singer."
32:40;32:42;"""The guy was everybody, if anybody."
32:42;32:44;"""But here's the thing about chameleons."
32:44;32:46;"""If you don't watch them changing colors,"
32:46;32:48;"""then they just look like an ordinary lizard."
32:48;32:51;"""Their uniqueness lies in their transformative nature."
32:51;32:52;"""So more fairly,"
32:52;32:54;"""Bobby Darin was more than a chameleon."
32:54;32:57;"""For each of his guises he inhabited with verve and gusto"
32:57;33:01;"""and even in repose, he just about vibrated with talent."""
33:01;33:02;"So he sort of,"
33:02;33:04;"it's classic this book where he's sort of like"
33:04;33:08;"a little bit of a dig, but also very complimentary."
33:08;33:09;"But I love that line about like,"
33:09;33:11;"the thing about chameleons is like,"
33:11;33:13;"if you don't see them changing,"
33:13;33:17;"they might kind of appear sort of ordinary or banal."
33:17;33:18;"- That's awesome too, because it's just,"
33:18;33:21;"that's just great music writing."
33:21;33:22;"- Yes."
33:22;33:22;"- Like that's the same thing."
33:22;33:24;"Like if you were just reading, you know,"
33:24;33:26;"some random like pitchfork review,"
33:26;33:27;"I don't know if they were like writing about"
33:27;33:29;"like a new Bruno Mars album."
33:29;33:30;"- Yeah."
33:30;33:30;"- And you saw that line,"
33:30;33:32;"I 100% would like double check who wrote it"
33:32;33:35;"and be like, okay, you're a great writer."
33:35;33:37;"- Yeah, we're talking chameleons."
33:37;33:39;"- Those are those moments that jump out"
33:39;33:42;"in the best music writing where you're kind of like,"
33:42;33:44;"yeah, that's like a cool way to put it."
33:44;33:47;"- Yeah, the prose in this book is very electric."
33:47;33:49;"- Yeah, Splish Splash was first"
33:49;33:52;"and then Mack the Knife came out a year later."
33:52;33:55;"- Exactly the opposite of what I would have guessed"
33:55;33:56;"if I hadn't seen the film."
33:56;33:57;"- Right."
33:57;34:00;"- Kevin Spacey does kind of look like Bobby Darin."
34:00;34:02;"- It's not that he doesn't look like him,"
34:02;34:04;"he just was the wrong age."
34:04;34:06;"Although Bobby Darin, I guess, apparently,"
34:06;34:08;"I think they talk about in the movie,"
34:08;34:10;"he went bald at a very young age,"
34:10;34:11;"so he was always wearing a wig."
34:11;34:15;"So maybe Kevin Spacey felt like I might be pushing 50,"
34:15;34:18;"but I think I can inhabit the mindset"
34:18;34:22;"of a balding 20 year old."
34:22;34:23;"- This is like-- - Fair enough."
34:23;34:26;"- Did you remember that movie, Dear Evan Hansen?"
34:26;34:27;"- Heard of it."
34:27;34:31;"- That was widely criticized for the Ben Platt"
34:31;34:33;"seeming much older than the teenage character."
34:33;34:35;"- Well, yeah, 'cause with certain actors,"
34:35;34:39;"it's not even just that they're older than the role,"
34:39;34:41;"'cause that's a tale as old as time."
34:41;34:44;"And maybe that's the sad part is the guy's probably like,"
34:44;34:49;"""I'm 29, but the cast of 90210, they were old as hell too."""
34:49;34:51;"And it's like, well, it's not just that."
34:51;34:53;"You just got an old face, man."
34:53;34:55;"You got old face."
34:55;34:57;"- Irishman's groundbreaking technology"
34:57;34:59;"wasn't available at the time."

35:02;35:05;"- Seinfeld, up in Canada,"
35:05;35:07;"is Bobby Darin part of the culture?"
35:07;35:09;"Did you grow up knowing Splish Splash?"
35:09;35:12;"- I mean, yeah, I don't, you know, Splish Splash,"
35:12;35:13;"especially when you're a kid,"
35:13;35:17;"I think it's like a popular song for young people."
35:17;35:19;"It's not like it was playing on the radio all the time"
35:19;35:21;"or anything like that."
35:21;35:22;"- Why is that?"
35:22;35:25;"Why is this song that was a kind of cutting edge rock song"
35:25;35:27;"for cool teenagers in the 50s,"
35:27;35:31;"why is it so associated with early childhood now?"
35:31;35:32;"Why do you think that is?"
35:32;35:33;"- Oh man, Jake?"

35:58;35:59;"This also begs the question."
35:59;36:03;"We'd have to find a, this is a sociological angle."
36:03;36:08;"In the late 50s, were baths infantilized in the same way?"
36:08;36:10;"- I think it was more common."
36:10;36:13;"- Right, it was more common that a grown man"

49:40;49:42;"Maybe."
49:42;49:43;"You would have to think so,"

52:15;52:19;"Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that Frank Sinatra never..."
52:19;52:21;"He never dabbled in that."
52:21;52:23;"He was a little bit too old, so he probably thought"
52:23;52:24;"the hippies were bums."

52:39;52:40;"Yes."
52:40;52:42;"I think Lee Hazelwood maybe even wrote a book about it."

52:55;52:58;"Well, I was digging around a little bit,"

53:01;53:05;"at the Troubadour in May of 1969."
53:05;53:09;"And I just went straight to, like, picturing, like,"

53:43;53:46;"about him, like, self-releasing his own albums."
53:46;53:48;"I don't know. It's pretty interesting."
53:48;53:53;"There's an album on a label called Direction Records,"
53:53;53:55;"which no one's ever heard of,"
53:55;53:58;"only because it's my own label."
53:58;54:02;"And the reason I started it was kind of interesting,"
54:02;54:03;"maybe, to some people."
54:03;54:07;"When my contract was up with the last company that I was with,"
54:07;54:10;"I should have said latest. No, last."
54:10;54:13;"I decided that I was going to try something."
54:13;54:15;"You know, I wanted to say something else,"
54:15;54:17;"things other than the things that I was doing before."
54:17;54:19;"So other labels came to me, and they said,"
54:19;54:21;"""We'd like to sign you,"" and I was very flattered by that."
54:21;54:22;"And I explained to them what I wanted to do, and they said,"

54:24;54:27;"""You want to do some of those protest songs. Very good."""
54:27;54:30;"""Right. Well, we have a special protest department."""

54:35;54:37;"""that's just devoted to protest things."""
54:37;54:39;"[laughter]"
54:39;54:41;"So they didn't understand what I wanted to do,"
54:41;54:43;"so I went to another label."
54:43;54:45;"And by the time I got to the other label for the appointment,"
54:45;54:48;"like, a week later, two or three of the guys from the label"
54:48;54:52;"I just left had already moved over to the next label."
54:52;54:54;"In the protest department, you know."
54:54;54:57;"Okay, so anyhow, I said, ""No, it has nothing to do with that."
54:57;54:58;"""I just would like to say some things."""
54:58;54:59;"They said, ""Well, yeah, you'll do one or two of those"

55:02;55:03;"""Uh-huh."""
55:03;55:06;"[laughter]"
55:06;55:08;"So I said, ""No, I already did that."""

55:11;55:13;"and I don't put it down."
55:13;55:15;"It was delicious to walk through all those years,"
55:15;55:17;"but it's, you know, some other things have happened for me,"
55:17;55:18;"and I would just like to--"
55:18;55:22;"In the meantime, I had to start my own label."
55:22;55:23;"So that's what I did."
55:23;55:25;"And the first album was called"

56:17;56:18;"changed his name. It didn't matter."

57:52;57:56;"It's also so funny, too, that in 1969,"
57:56;57:59;"he had probably just turned 33."
57:59;58:00;"Yeah."
58:00;58:06;"And it's just interesting how back then, culture shifted,"
58:06;58:08;"especially in the '60s, was shifting in such a major way."
58:08;58:12;"A guy like him, he probably felt so ancient."
58:12;58:14;"He probably felt like he'd lived five lives."
58:14;58:17;"When he references Mack the Knife,"
58:17;58:20;"which would have been a decade earlier,"
58:20;58:23;"it probably felt like 30 years, the way he's talking about it."
58:23;58:26;"Yeah, I mean, Mack, everything's different."
58:26;58:28;"He's just struggling to find himself."

58:48;58:50;"Whereas back then, this dude probably felt--"

01:01:32;01:01:32;"Right."
01:01:32;01:01:35;"It's funny because, you know, like, Del Shannon put out"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"a record around the same time period"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"called The Continuing Adventures of Charles Wendover, which"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"I believe is-- that was his first--"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"that was his real name."
01:01:44;01:01:44;"Whoa."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"And it's kind of similar, where it's"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"like a guy who was a big star in the late '50s kind of puts"
01:01:49;01:01:54;"out his weird late '60s, early '70s, like, psych folk record."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"They all tend to have something in common."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"They're like hitting the same themes."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"It is funny that nobody--"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"none of these guys got into the counterculture"
01:02:02;01:02:07;"and read the books and took the drugs and then, like, you know."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Or just made, like, Buddy Holly--"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Invented minimalist techno."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Or did, like, almost like a--"
01:02:12;01:02:16;"just teeny bopper Buddy Holly stuff,"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"like, songs that they could have written 10 years prior when"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"they were, like, forming their aesthetic pathways."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"But then just, yeah, like, wrote, like,"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"Buddy Holly-style songs or Everly Brothers songs"
01:02:26;01:02:30;"about, like, transcendental meditation or whatever."
01:02:30;01:02:30;"Right."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Yeah, that would have been interesting, too."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"It's like you come back from seeing Beyond the Veil"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"and say--"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"you know, the main thing I realized was that, you know,"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"time isn't real and I am going to eternally make music that"
01:02:42;01:02:46;"sounds like 1959 because it just doesn't matter."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"That 1959 is as present as 1969."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"But my lyrics are going to be informed by my experience"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"seeing the face of God and understanding"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"the oneness of all things."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"That would be so sick, just, like,"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"the exact same arrangements as Mack the Knife,"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"except it's Tibetan Book of the Dead lyrics."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Buddy Holly, to me, is one of the real, like--"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"I mean, there's so many, like, what-ifs in rock history"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"of people that died way too young,"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"but what would Buddy Holly have been doing in 1969?"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Great question."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"You know, we'll never know."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"But yeah, maybe this Bobby Darin thing"
01:03:21;01:03:26;"is a weird adjacent answer to that question."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"Back to Bob, it's interesting that Bob Dylan is--"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"I mean, it kind of shows what everybody's always known"
01:03:33;01:03:38;"is that Bob Dylan, he's mystical, he's inscrutable,"
01:03:38;01:03:42;"he can seem kind of capricious at times,"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"but he is kind of what he says he is."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"You know, when he's the voice of a generation,"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"writing these, like, kind of unbelievable songs that"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"speak to the moment, pulling this, like,"
01:03:54;01:03:58;"deep, weird poetry out of the universe."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"And then in the late '60s, when kind of the hippies"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"go mainstream, he becomes a little bit trad."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"He's making, like--"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Nashville Skyline."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"You know, starts making--"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"he's making Nashville Skyline, distancing himself"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"from the counterculture, and then eventually he ends up"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"in his kind of groove where people are like,"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"""What's up with you, man?"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Why'd you bend on stuff?"""
01:04:16;01:04:18;"And his vibe is kind of like, ""Listen,"
01:04:18;01:04:19;"I'm just an entertainer."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"I write songs, I perform them."""
01:04:21;01:04:22;"And, you know, everybody always thinks"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"he's being a little bit ironic when he says that,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"because obviously there's so much weird,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"vibey stuff in his music."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"And yet there probably is a pretty strong degree"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"of truth in that, where he--"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"there might be a type of weird mysticism"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"that comes out in the music, but at the end of the day,"
01:04:38;01:04:42;"he's a dude who-- he is a song and dance man."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"And he loves songs."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"And he loves Chopez."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"He changed his name, just like Cary Grant."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"And also, I mean, I'm sure many people have referenced this,"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"and we happen to be talking about Once Upon a Time"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"in Hollywood."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Quentin Tarantino also just dropped a book"

01:04:57;01:04:58;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"Have you heard about this, Jake?"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"I've heard about it, yeah."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"It's eerily similar, I would say."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"It's-- from what I've read about it,"
01:05:04;01:05:09;"it's Tarantino talking about his early movie-going experiences"
01:05:09;01:05:12;"and films from the '70s that he considers to be important."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"I don't know if his book's a little more personal,"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"but it's-- he's somebody who's always said"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"he loves film criticism."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"He's influenced by film writing."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"He famously worked at a video store."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"He loves the history of cinema."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"He likes talking about cinema."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"He likes-- I tried list-- he has a podcast."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"I know."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"I checked it out."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"With his boy, Roger Avery."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I, like, listened to one episode once,"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"and at a certain point, I just had no idea what these guys"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"were talking about, because it was--"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"I hadn't seen the movies."
01:05:40;01:05:40;"Yeah."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"It truly was like, wow, these guys are still"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"too dude to work at a video store just talking"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"about, like, obscure movies."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"And they know the stuff inside and out."
01:05:49;01:05:54;"They know exactly when these directors made their movies."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"They know who starred in them."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"These are guys who are just so passionate about the history"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"and the form."
01:05:59;01:06:02;"Anyway, there's something funny about him releasing his book"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"when Bob Dylan releases his song book,"
01:06:06;01:06:11;"because they are people who, as much as they might, you know,"
01:06:11;01:06:15;"tap into something transcendent, their vibe as human beings"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"does seem to be just like real regular fans."

01:06:21;01:06:25;"but who also never lose sight of, like, entertaining."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"I read the--"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"you know, before this book, Quentin Tarantino just"
01:06:31;01:06:35;"released the novelization of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"And I read that, and there would just be--"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"and in that, you learn more about Cliff Booth,"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"and he's very into film."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Did you read it, Jake?"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"I read, like, half of it."
01:06:44;01:06:47;"And I put it down to read the Bob book, actually."
01:06:47;01:06:51;"Similarly, Cliff Booth is very into film."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"That's sort of a back story that they--"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"you know, there's sort of his personality trait that"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"didn't make it into the film."
01:06:58;01:07:03;"But there'll just be pages of him talking or thinking"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"about his--"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"just three pages of his favorite--"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"just listing his favorite samurai movies."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Yeah."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Yeah, and there's a point, like, the podcast, where you're just"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"like, I mean, I really am loving this,"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"but I have no idea what I'm reading anymore."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Yeah."
01:07:18;01:07:22;"Cliff goes to this cinema in Little Tokyo"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"that must have existed in 1969 and watches,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"like, Japanese samurai movies."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Yeah."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"I remember reading that part of the book and just like, OK,"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"I'm not going to just keep reading the titles."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"I'm going to, like--"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"I'm just going to skim to the next page here."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"I mean, I will say, in both these instances,"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"it is-- it's a service."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"You know, it'll be interesting to see what"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"our generation's version of it is,"
01:07:44;01:07:50;"but it's a service to be really passionate about a bygone era"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"and kind of keep it alive."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"And I like when there's these kind of well-known figures"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"who do that."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"I guess another example is Scorsese."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"You're always reading about, you know, Scorsese pours all this"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"money into preserving world cinema heritage."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Yeah."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"Because, you know, he's so passionate about, you know,"
01:08:08;01:08:12;"a director who made five films in Senegal in the '60s"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"and wanting to make sure that the-- you know,"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"it's preserved and restored and things like that."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"Because after Bob Dylan, some of these songs, you know,"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"who's going to be talking about them?"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"You know, ""Mack the Knife,"" that's a hit."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"People always be talking about it."
01:08:27;01:08:27;"Yeah."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"There's a lot of stuff in here I don't know at all"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"that I'm excited to learn about."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"It's cool when an artist is, like, really"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"passionate about something, even if they don't draw"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"a direct line to their own work."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"But yeah, Bob Dylan is-- if Quentin Tarantino is, like,"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"the kind of video store generation,"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"Bob Dylan's kind of like, you know,"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"the record store generation, where--"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"or even before that, he's, like, talking about a bygone era"
01:08:51;01:08:55;"of, like, you know, 78 singles and stuff like that."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Yeah."
01:08:56;01:09:01;"Just really passionate about the old-time America."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Old-wood America."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"Do you know the song ""There Stands the Glass"" by Webb Pierce?"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"I don't know if I'd heard it before."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"I listened to it when I started reading the book."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Because in the book, he's talking about--"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"because, like, the way this book is formatted"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"is that, like, the beginning of the chapter"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"is, like, his interpretation of the lyrics, essentially."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"And then the second half of the chapter"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"is him sort of more zooming out and talking"
01:09:22;01:09:26;"about the artist in sort of a historic context."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"""There Stands the Glass,"" like, it's all about, like,"
01:09:29;01:09:32;"a dude just, like, downing bourbon at a bar who committed"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"all these, like, war atrocities."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And I was like, is that in the song?"
01:09:36;01:09:40;"(SINGING) There stands the glass."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Wow."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"(SINGING) That will ease all my pain."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Oh, I know this song."
01:09:45;01:09:50;"(SINGING) That will settle my brain."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"It's my first one today."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Oh, this is a classic drinking song so far."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"(SINGING) There stands the glass."
01:09:58;01:10:02;"That will hide all my tears."
01:10:02;01:10:06;"That will drown all my fears."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Brother, I'm on my way."
01:10:09;01:10:13;"I'm wondering where you are tonight."
01:10:13;01:10:17;"I'm wondering if you are all right."
01:10:17;01:10:21;"I wonder if you think of me."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"And my--"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"You guys fans of Sam Hunt?"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Oh, sure."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"I love Sam Hunt."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Did he cover this?"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Well, no."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Sam Hunt did a version of this?"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"No."
01:10:31;01:10:35;"Throw on ""Hard to Forget"" and just check out how wild this is."
01:10:35;01:10:38;"Well, yeah, in Bob's imagination,"
01:10:38;01:10:42;"before we get to the Sam Hunt, this guy, he fought like a savage."
01:10:42;01:10:44;"He stuck the bayonet into baby's bellies"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"and gouged out old man's eyes."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"He's been unfaithful to the human spirit,"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"and he's assassinated priests."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"He's lost his independence years ago."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"He's lived on rations, and he's done degenerate and demonic things."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"He plugs his head into nightly dreams"
01:10:59;01:11:02;"and sees million-dollar wounds, purple hearts,"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"and sees his ranks whittled down piecemeal."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"He rounds up elderly women, children, torches their huts,"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"and turns his machine gun upon them."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"So he's just like--"
01:11:13;01:11:17;"He sees shadowy figures in black pajamas and canonical hats."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"He sees a little two-year-old boy and murders him."
01:11:20;01:11:25;"He sees his buddies slit a little girl open with a knife,"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"strip her clothes off, and [INAUDIBLE] her."
01:11:27;01:11:30;"Then he shoots her with an automatic shotgun."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"Then he shoots her with an automatic, his horny buddy."
01:11:33;01:11:38;"So when Bob hears that song, I guess that guy's at the bar."
01:11:38;01:11:42;"He was in a war, and they committed all these war crimes."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"And he's having his first drink of the day."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Damn, Bob."
01:11:46;01:11:49;"Bob went in on ""There Stands a Glass."""
01:11:49;01:11:50;"I don't know about all that."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"(SINGING) There stands a glass."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"It sounds more like he's missing a lover, but--"
01:11:56;01:12:00;"That's so funny when you play the Sam Hunt version."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"If this were the guy--"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"OK, play the Sam Hunt version."
01:12:04;01:12:08;"(SINGING) There stands the glass."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"Is this just Sam Hunt?"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"(SINGING) That will ease all my pain."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"That will settle my brain."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Wait, this must be another dude named Sam Hunt."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"No, listen."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"Oh, it's a sample?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Oh, OK."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"(SINGING) There stands a glass."
01:12:23;01:12:27;"That will ease all my pain."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Oh, my god."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"I love it."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"(SINGING) It's my first one today."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"All right."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"(SINGING) I saw your sister's work."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"This is the Baz Luhrmann, the Web Pierce biopic version."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"(SINGING) I saw your car at the mall."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"I see your face in the clouds."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"It's so cool."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"(SINGING) I smell your perfume in clouds."
01:12:47;01:12:50;"I swear your number's on my phone once the call."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"(SINGING) It's kind of funny how I can't"
01:12:54;01:12:58;"seem to get away from you."
01:12:58;01:13:04;"It's almost like you don't want me to."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"You've got--"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"(SINGING) There stands the glass."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"(SINGING) --and told our truth."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"that you showed up tonight."
01:13:14;01:13:19;"And that dress is a mess for my head."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"So much for a soul wrong."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Got a side out of mine."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"Girl, you're looking so good."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"I don't see what the ""There Stands the Glass"" sample"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"adds to this song at all."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Maybe he just wanted to break some off"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"to the estate of Web Pierce."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"I think that it--"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"I mean, I love it."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"I kind of like it."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"I mean, it's not--"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"I think that it connects it--"
01:13:40;01:13:44;"I do think that it connects it to, like, a tradition,"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"you know, because he's already--"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"Yeah, yeah."
01:13:47;01:13:53;"It is basically getting very close to whatever, you know,"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"we've talked about it before, the country trap is."
01:13:57;01:14:01;"And the sample, it's sort of like, I guess,"
01:14:01;01:14:05;"literally what a hip hop producer would do with--"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Sure, yeah."
01:14:06;01:14:07;"Like a classic--"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Like an old soul."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"--chopped soul sample."
01:14:09;01:14:12;"(SINGING) --bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"that you showed up tonight."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"That dress just a minute's from my head."
01:14:18;01:14:21;"So much for a soul."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"Got a side out of mine."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"Girl, you're looking so good."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"What's Sam Hunt's song about?"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"Is he drinking, or is he going by the mall?"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"He's drinking because of the jilted lover, the woman who's--"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"like, he's having a difficult time in the relationship."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"And that's why--"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Oh, it's the same thing."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"Sam Hunt's drinking that, too."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Sam's at the Cheesecake Factory drinking."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"Just getting hammered."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"Not reflecting on his war atrocities."
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Yeah."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"There is something very poetic about the original, too,"
01:14:47;01:14:50;"where I think what really slam dunks it is--"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"because when it opened, ""There stands the glass that"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"will ease all my pain,"" you're like, all right,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"guy's getting ready to drink."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"We've heard that before."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"That will settle my brain."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"OK, you want to get--"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"trying to just calm down."
01:15:01;01:15:06;"And then just the killer line, ""It's my first one today."""
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Yeah."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Then it's like, oh, God, oh, no."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Because--"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"It's the first of 10."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"--that's when it gets really depressing,"
01:15:13;01:15:17;"which is a really good kind of way of unfolding the story."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"Because you're first like, all right,"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"who hasn't needed to take the edge off with a drink"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"at one point in their life?"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Everybody."
01:15:25;01:15:26;"Everybody's had a stressful day."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I could really use a drink."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"But this is that line, ""It's my first one today."""
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Suddenly, you have a vision."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Oh, my God, it's 9 AM."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"You just woke up, probably hung over from the night before."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"You're about to drink all day long."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"You're in a dark place."
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Even if it's like 5 PM, he's been looking forward--"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"like, he's like, this is my first one."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"Like, this is my first of many."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"Right."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"This is the best part of the day."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Like, it's just as I'm starting."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"And also, yeah, even if it is--"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"you're right, early evening, late afternoon--"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"it's my first one today."
01:15:56;01:15:59;"That also implies a dude who every single day--"
01:15:59;01:16:00;"Today."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"--wakes up and the clock is ticking."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"So that sounds like somebody who drinks every day."
01:16:04;01:16:07;"The clock is ticking, just like, thank God it's 5 PM."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Let's [BLEEP] start drinking."
01:16:08;01:16:12;"It's been a really hard day not being wasted."
01:16:12;01:16:15;"You like Jake's Sunday morning coming down?"
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Uh-huh."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"You know, when he says he has that beer for breakfast,"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"it tasted so good, he'll have one for dessert."
01:16:21;01:16:23;"Uh-huh, right."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"Throw on Sunday morning coming down,"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"doing a little country moment."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"I think the Willie Nelson version is probably the nicest one."
01:16:30;01:16:31;"Does Kris Kristofferson do that?"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"Yeah."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Yeah, he--"
01:16:33;01:16:34;"That's sort of the more famous one."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"That's the one I know."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"He wrote-- yeah."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"He wrote it?"
01:16:37;01:16:38;"I thought he wrote it, yeah."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Yeah, I think he wrote it."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"But yeah, I like Willie Nelsons, and Johnny Cash does a version."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"I don't know if I've heard the Willie Nelson."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"Oh, put on the Willie Nelson if you can find it,"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"because I think it hits the emotion best."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"And then Johnny Cash has a good cover of it, too."
01:16:50;01:16:55;"[MUSIC - WILLIE NELSON, ""SUNDAY MORNING""]"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"(SINGING) Well, I woke up Sunday morning--"

01:17:07;01:17:11;"(SINGING) And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"so I had one more for dessert."
01:17:14;01:17:19;"[MUSIC - WILLIE NELSON, ""SUNDAY MORNING""]"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"(SINGING) Then I fumbled through my closet, bought my clothes,"
01:17:23;01:17:28;"and found my cleanest, dirtiest shirt."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Hard relate to that."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"My cleanest, dirtiest shirt."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"(SINGING) I shaved my face and combed my hair"
01:17:34;01:17:38;"and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day."
01:17:38;01:17:42;"Surprise, he's shaved."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Yeah."
01:17:44;01:17:48;"(SINGING) I'd smoked my brain the night before with cigarettes"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"and songs that I'd been picking."
01:17:55;01:18:01;"But I lit my first, watched a small kid cussing out a can"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"that he was kicking."
01:18:02;01:18:13;"And I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"of someone frying chicken."
01:18:20;01:18:25;"And it took me back to something that I'd lost somehow,"
01:18:25;01:18:28;"somewhere along the way."
01:18:28;01:18:38;"On a Sunday morning sidewalk, wishing, Lord,"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"that I was gone."
01:18:39;01:18:45;"'Cause there's something in a Sunday."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"Makes a body feel alone."
01:18:51;01:18:56;"And there's something--"
01:18:56;01:18:59;"It's a cool companion piece to ""Sunday Morning"""
01:18:59;01:19:01;"by Velvet Underground."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Yeah."
01:19:02;01:19:05;"Just like, feeling like ass on a Sunday morning."
01:19:05;01:19:12;"(SINGING) On the sleeping city sidewalk."
01:19:12;01:19:17;"It makes you wonder, when did Sundays start to suck?"
01:19:17;01:19:20;"Historically speaking, Sundays must have ruled at some point."
01:19:20;01:19:26;"If you work every day, and then Sunday, go to church,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"take a load off, no work--"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"Picnic in the park."
01:19:30;01:19:34;"--spend time with your family, Sundays are probably the best"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"day of the week at some point."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Did Sundays start to suck in the '60s?"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Well, if you're just like a--"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"Where the song is from?"
01:19:40;01:19:44;"If you're just a Nerdy Well drifting deadbeat,"
01:19:44;01:19:47;"like the guys in these songs, then--"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Sundays always suck for you."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Yeah, it sucks."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"And I think especially if Sundays is, you know,"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"time and you've fallen from grace, it's got to hit hard."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Right."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"And you're looking at all the responsible people"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"who have families, who are going to church,"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"and you're just like--"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Yeah, I'm on the other side of that one."
01:20:05;01:20:08;"(SINGING) Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday."
01:20:12;01:20:20;"On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishing, Lord, that I was gone."
01:20:20;01:20:34;"'Cause there's something in a Sunday that makes a body feel alone."
01:20:34;01:20:38;"Well, and like, Sundays are a hard day to be alone."
01:20:38;01:20:43;"I mean, arguably, Mondays are better, because Saturday night,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"you went hard, because it's Saturday night,"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"so you're paying the price Sunday morning."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Monday morning, you're not at work,"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"like the rest of the working stiffs are."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Right."
01:20:52;01:20:56;"So you took it easy Sunday night, nursing that hangover."
01:20:56;01:20:59;"Monday's a bright, sunny day for you."
01:20:59;01:21:01;"Yeah, what do you think Garfield's problem was?"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Because Garfield wasn't like a working--"
01:21:03;01:21:06;"Garfield was lazing around all the time."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"He wasn't--"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"It's interesting, Mondays to suck."
01:21:10;01:21:13;"No, yeah, I think we're uncovering something very interesting."
01:21:13;01:21:16;"It's like when you're kind of just like mid-level depressed,"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"your least favorite day is Monday."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"When you're really depressed, your least favorite day is Sunday."
01:21:22;01:21:26;"If you've really tasted the dark side of life, you hate Sundays."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"In fact, next time someone tells me they hate Mondays,"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"I'll say, ""Well, you should check your privilege."""
01:21:30;01:21:33;"If you hate Mondays, that means you must have it pretty good,"
01:21:33;01:21:36;"because a really sad person, they love Mondays."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"They hate Sundays."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Give me a call when you're crying on Sunday."
01:21:40;01:21:44;"I can think of times in my life where I was just like feeling weird."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"And actually, I can almost remember this feeling."
01:21:46;01:21:49;"It is pretty different being older,"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"but I can almost remember the feeling of just being like,"
01:21:52;01:21:58;"yeah, maybe hungover, maybe like feeling like isolated or something on a Sunday"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"and just trying to like get through the day."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"And then Monday starts, the world's back to work,"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"things are happening, and being kind of like--"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"even if I had some bullsh*t I had to do on Monday,"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"if I had to go back to work, I was like, ""All right, yeah, good."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"I'm glad Sunday's over."" Sunday's way more existential."
01:22:10;01:22:14;"Monday's just like-- the reason people don't like Mondays is just work sucks."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"I know."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"Sundays are like your looks peering into the void."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Oh, for sure."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"You guys ever get the Sunday scaries?"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"Do you know about the Sunday scaries?"
01:22:24;01:22:29;"Or is that more of like a knowledge worker, like an office job type of thing?"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"I don't know what that is."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"I've never heard of the Sunday scaries."
01:22:32;01:22:35;"It just means like you're scared about going to work"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"or you just have a bad, weird feeling."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"Yeah, that's that pre-Monday kind of like you've got some work emails"
01:22:41;01:22:45;"trickling in in the evening that are trying to get ahead of the Monday rush."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"You're like, ""I got to adjust my sleep schedule now."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"I got that project."""
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Right."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"But you know what's weird?"
01:22:54;01:22:58;"I do think-- and I think this is a good argument"
01:22:58;01:23:03;"that all of our consciousnesses are connected into one"
01:23:03;01:23:09;"is that I feel like a lot of people get that feeling even when they don't have a job."
01:23:09;01:23:17;"There is something about-- and I've had pretty real regular type jobs in my life"
01:23:17;01:23:21;"a long time ago, but there are times where I still feel it"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"and that truly is the danger zone because if you play your cards right on a Sunday,"
01:23:25;01:23:31;"you spend time with people you love, it could be a very beautiful first half of a Sunday."
01:23:31;01:23:36;"If you're waking up hungover, live by yourself and slam two beers,"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"walk out the door and smell other people's fried chicken, that's going to be tough."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"But if you have friends and family, Sunday can be great."
01:23:43;01:23:47;"Have a nice breakfast, walk around, do this."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"But even when you have a lot of stability in your life,"
01:23:50;01:23:54;"I do think the Sunday scaries sneak into the collective consciousness."
01:23:54;01:24:01;"I haven't had-- I don't work an office job, and yeah, Sunday evening can be kind of a strange vibe."
01:24:01;01:24:05;"I wonder how-- because you know how in some calendars, Sunday is the first day of the week?"
01:24:05;01:24:10;"Like it's not actually Monday. I wonder if that has anything to do with this."
01:24:10;01:24:14;"Because it's the first day of the week. Maybe it's because it's not settled."
01:24:14;01:24:17;"Some people say Sunday is the first day of the week, some people say Monday."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"It's weird. We don't know."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"It's the uncertainty of it. It's the ambiguity."
01:24:22;01:24:28;"According to Wikipedia, it actually looks like in the West, Sunday is the first day of the week."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"Is that your-- Jake, is that your understanding?"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"No, Monday is the first day of the week. I don't--"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"I've seen it on calendars."
01:24:36;01:24:39;"I don't buy into that. I mean, yes, Sunday is the first day in the calendar, but I--"
01:24:39;01:24:43;"there was a first column on the left, but I-- it doesn't track."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Monday is the first day of the week."
01:24:45;01:24:53;"The show rules. I'm looking at a Wikipedia map here that's color-coded by the days of the week,"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"and we've got like Russia, parts of Africa, Australia."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Monday is the first day."
01:24:58;01:25:02;"That's a wall of blue from North America down to South America."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"It's a blue wave."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"It's a blue--"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"But I just want to say something."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"Regardless of if you think Sunday is the first day of the week or Monday is,"
01:25:10;01:25:13;"we can all agree that after Monday, you're usually going to get Tuesday."
01:25:13;01:25:16;"Then Wednesday. Some people call that hump day."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"Thursday, things get pretty interesting."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"There's a real vibe shift on Thursday."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Yeah, that order is universal."
01:25:24;01:25:27;"And then Friday and Saturday, everybody's having a ball."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"Here's the truth, is that Monday is the first day of the week."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Saturday is the last day of the week."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"And Sunday is the void."
01:25:34;01:25:42;"So what happens when, you know, I believe the UK has been experimenting with a four-day work week?"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Really? Wow."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Yes."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Yeah, that's--"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Nationally? Wow."
01:25:46;01:25:50;"Nationally, they, I think, spent the summer on a four-day work week."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Certainly, there's news that I've read."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"So what happens, do we just--"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"So three-day weekend."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"So they work Monday through Thursday and you get Friday off?"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Yeah."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"I wonder if that could backfire."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"I mean, I'd like to imagine--"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"They should do Monday off."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"Oh, that'd be interesting."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Yeah, to take the sting out of Sunday."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"You got to keep Friday, Friday."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"No more scaries."
01:26:12;01:26:16;"Of course, everybody should work a little bit less and deserves more time off."
01:26:16;01:26:25;"But I wonder if it'll be one of those things like when they start adding lanes to highways to help with the traffic congestion and it just gets worse somehow."
01:26:25;01:26:37;"If it'll be like something where having Friday and Saturday off, actually, it's like you're pulling back a rubber band and you get even more hardcore Sunday scaries on Sunday."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"And actually, in 10 years, they'll look back and be like, ""Oh, God."""
01:26:41;01:26:42;"What have we done?"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"The Sunday scaries are a national epidemic."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Things are really getting weird."
01:26:46;01:26:51;"Will Sunday have even more Sunday-ness in a three-day weekend?"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"That's the question that the UK is playing."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"They're doing a very dangerous experiment right now."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"You know what this is reminding me of?"
01:26:58;01:27:11;"Do you guys see that news article about the Chick-fil-A owner in Florida who's changed his calendar to make it a three-day, 14-hour-a-day work week to avoid burnout?"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"It's apparently taken off."
01:27:14;01:27:27;"Justin Lindsay, the local operator of Chick-fil-A Kendall, that's Kendall, Florida, said, ""My idea was to provide staff with this gift of time by creating a scheduling system where they could know exactly which days they worked."
01:27:27;01:27:34;"The program started in February, has resulted in 100% employee retention and a flood of new applicants."""
01:27:34;01:27:36;"People are loving the three-day week."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"The gift of time."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"There you go."
01:27:38;01:27:43;"I mean, I would way rather work three 14-hour days than six 7-hour days."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Yeah."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Absolutely."
01:27:45;01:27:49;"If it's a day when you have to work, it's a work day."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Let's do that 14-hour shift."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Hell yeah."
01:27:51;01:27:58;"You probably get so in the zone by the end, you're probably just making the best chicken sandwiches of your life by hour 14."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Oh, no doubt."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I would totally be down for that."

01:29:20;01:29:21;"'cause remember a few episodes ago,"
01:29:21;01:29:25;"we did the 30th anniversary of Alice in Chains Dirt,"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"which I know really opened the doors of perception"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"on your end, Ezra."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"I don't think you were that familiar with that record."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"- No, I really appreciated that episode."
01:29:33;01:29:37;"'Cause yeah, after that I was listening to Dirt quite a bit."
01:29:37;01:29:42;"I was going pretty deep on Alice in Chains history,"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"listening to some of their other work,"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"reading in-depth Rolling Stone profiles"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"from the '90s about the band."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"- You're all in on AIC."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"- I'm Alice-pilled now."
01:29:52;01:29:55;"They're very, yeah, excellent, excellent album."
01:29:55;01:29:58;"And I'll be having Dirt Nights for the foreseeable future."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"- Well, there's another record"
01:29:59;01:30:03;"that celebrated a 30th anniversary just this past week."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"They came out in November of 1992,"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"and that's Ween's major label debut"
01:30:08;01:30:12;"on Elektra Records' Division of Warner Communications,"
01:30:12;01:30:16;"their record ""Pure Guava,"" which was their third album."
01:30:16;01:30:20;"But I was reading the 33rd and third book on it."
01:30:20;01:30:24;"Well, actually, there's a 33 and a third book"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"on ""Chocolate and Cheese,"""
01:30:25;01:30:27;"which was the one they did after ""Pure Guava."""
01:30:27;01:30:29;"But there's a whole chapter about ""Pure Guava,"""
01:30:29;01:30:32;"and it's talking about after Nebraska,"
01:30:32;01:30:37;"""Pure Guava"" was the second lo-fi four-track record"
01:30:37;01:30:41;"released by a major label, which I thought was fascinating."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"- Yeah, interesting."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"- Anyway, I love, this is sort of all an aside,"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"but ""Pure Guava"" has been one of my,"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"it's my favorite Ween album, which is saying a lot,"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"'cause that's a band I love."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Are you a bunch of a Ween guy?"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"I mean, I know we've touched on them a little bit"
01:30:56;01:30:57;"on the show."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"- I've never gone deep on Ween."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"They're one of those bands that I always assume"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"I'll have my moment with,"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"because people that I like, like you,"
01:31:05;01:31:08;"and people I knew growing up,"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"they always seemed like a cool band."
01:31:09;01:31:13;"And especially, I knew that they were from,"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"not that far away from New Jersey and Pennsylvania,"
01:31:15;01:31:18;"and they just kind of seemed like, yeah, New Hope,"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"a place where I've been, Bucks County, PA."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"So they're just one of those bands"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"where I just felt like, oh yeah, they seem fun."
01:31:25;01:31:29;"And I always knew the song ""Spirit of '76."""
01:31:29;01:31:30;"- ""Freedom,"" yeah."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"- Oh, ""Freedom of '76."""
01:31:31;01:31:34;"Yeah, and I was always like, it was funny,"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"but the chords are so sophisticated."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"So I always had a feeling one day I'll get in,"
01:31:38;01:31:42;"but they strike me as a band, similar to Bobby Darin."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"They're so chameleon-like that you could only"
01:31:44;01:31:47;"really get them probably when you've listened deeply,"
01:31:47;01:31:51;"because I love ""Freedom of '76."""
01:31:51;01:31:54;"I love, I hear that song, ""Ocean Man."""
01:31:54;01:31:56;"- ""Ocean Man."""
01:31:56;01:31:57;"Well, I mean, this, it's actually,"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"a lot of funny tie-ins with Bobby Darin."
01:31:59;01:32:03;"Not only, yeah, I couldn't let our chameleon episode"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"go by without referencing ""Wean."""
01:32:05;01:32:08;"And also, they put out that record, ""The Mollusk,"""
01:32:08;01:32:11;"which features ""Ocean Man,"" which is their ocean-based,"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"water-based, nautical album,"

01:36:55;01:37:00;"of like 80s and 90s, like funny white guy music."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"And maybe one end of the spectrum is like,"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"they might be giants who I imagine you don't like, Jake."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- I do not."
01:37:06;01:37:10;"- Then you get like Phish, Ween,"
01:37:10;01:37:10;"and then I guess you get to--"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"- Bare Naked Ladies."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"- Oh, Bare Naked Ladies."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"And then I guess there's like,"
01:37:15;01:37:19;"in terms of like how cool the people are like trying to be,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"like I feel like They Might Be Giants is like,"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"they revel in just being kind of like, yeah, like--"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"- Dorks."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"- We're dorks."
01:37:25;01:37:29;"Phish, I think, is so in their own world that they're like,"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"we don't give a (beep) if you think we're dorks."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"- You know what it is?"
01:37:32;01:37:36;"It's not, Phish isn't nerdy the way that,"
01:37:36;01:37:37;"I think it's almost not even dorks."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"They're saying that They Might Be Giants is very nerdy."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"- Very comic-on."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"- They Might Be Giants is nerdy."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"- TMPG is nerdy, Phish is dorky."
01:37:44;01:37:46;"- Well, Phish is also--"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"- We're splitting the diff."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"- I think Phish is also like,"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"they're like, we're shredder musicians."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Well, I'm talking about early Phish,"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"'cause eventually they kind of had more emotional stuff,"
01:37:55;01:37:55;"but I think they're kind of like,"
01:37:55;01:37:58;"we're shredder musicians, we're having fun,"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"we're not trying to be cool"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"in the classical sense of being cool."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"Then Ween is somewhere in between."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"And then on the other side of the spectrum,"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"you have like Beck and Pavement"
01:38:08;01:38:11;"who actually are trying to be cool."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"I don't mean that derogatorily,"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"you might just say they are cool."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"- I think Ween was trying,"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"I mean, Ween had a very antagonistic relationship"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"with their audience in the beginning"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"when there was just the two of them,"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"and they just had like a drum machine on stage,"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"and they were just playing gigs in New Jersey."
01:38:28;01:38:31;"And like, people hated that band."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"And like, they relished in that."
01:38:32;01:38:35;"And they relished in like doing like,"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"yeah, doing like an eight minute version"
01:38:36;01:38:39;"of like, When the Going Gets Tough from the Get Go."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"And people just being like, what is this?"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Matt, I just want to close out the Ween discussion"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"before we get to the top five,"
01:38:44;01:38:45;"but put on Sarah."
01:38:45;01:38:49;"'Cause then like, there's all this like weird sounding,"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"you know, borderline bad music."
01:38:51;01:38:54;"And then there's just like gorgeous ballads like this one."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"(soft music)"

01:39:22;01:39:27;"- Did you play Tender Situation?"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"- I didn't play Tender Situation."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"- I think that's weird."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"- Tender Situation, I thought about it."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"- I think it's a beautiful song."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"- Yeah, I know."
01:39:35;01:39:36;"It's beautiful."
01:39:36;01:39:37;"- It's a beautiful song."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"It's an incredible song title."
01:39:39;01:39:42;"- So he has like the vocals pitched up on all these songs?"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"- No, not on this."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"This is just him singing."
01:39:46;01:39:46;"- It's wild."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"- I mean, he's an incredible singer."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"That's the weird thing."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"You're listening to this record"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"and like the vocals are all pitched on a lot of them."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"And then like a few of them, he just sings straight."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"And he's such an incredible singer."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"- Yeah."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"- So you're just like, damn."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"- To also think more."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"And we've talked once about that there used to be"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"the slight beef between Phish and Ween."
01:40:08;01:40:09;"- Yeah."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"- If I had to describe,"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"and of course I relate to all this music."
01:40:13;01:40:17;"I've definitely dabbled in funny white guy music in my life."
01:40:17;01:40:21;"But the, if you think about like being in like high school"
01:40:21;01:40:24;"or something, there's something about like Phish"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"seems like a bunch of like dudes"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"who just maybe have their own kind of like"
01:40:29;01:40:33;"funny little club would probably be like really nice"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"if you sat down at lunch with them."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"They have like their own, like some like dudes in the band"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"who just kind of, and you like sat down and be like,"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"hey, what's up?"
01:40:41;01:40:44;"Whereas like Ween have almost like"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"that like slightly aggressive underachiever vibe."
01:40:47;01:40:52;"Like some dude at your school who's like super smart."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"And like once in a while would like make some really"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"cutting remark in class just to be like,"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"yeah, you know what, (beep) you."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"- Yeah."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"I don't think they're nice guys."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"I think they like,"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"yeah, I think the guys in Phish are sweet."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I don't think the guys in Ween are very sweet,"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"but I'm not friends with any of them."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"So, you know, I could care, you know what I mean?"
01:41:11;01:41:12;"Like I don't really care."
01:41:12;01:41:16;"- But let's say you go to a new high school in 1992."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"You see Phish sitting at a table,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"you see Ween sitting at a table."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"You're a Jake type dude."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"You're kind of an idiosyncratic guy."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"You like music."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"You like to crack a joke or two."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"You go sit down with Ween, just be like,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"oh, you like the t-shirts they're wearing."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"What's up dudes?"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"We just moved here."

01:42:06;01:42:07;"Just doesn't respond."

01:53:21;01:53:25;"- Apparently this was about actor Sean Penn."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- Yeah, they were married, I think."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- Were they married?"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"- I think so."
01:53:29;01:53:30;"- Yeah, I think they were."

01:53:41;01:53:43;"just having this like great instinct"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"for like alternating between like provocative,"
01:53:45;01:53:50;"like a virgin, and then just like real down the middle,"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"true blue, kind of like sweet stuff."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"- Yeah."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"She's a chameleon."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"- Oh, totally."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"- Total chameleon app."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"- Yeah, but you can still see,"
01:53:59;01:54:04;"Madonna has her Madonna-ness is embedded in every song more."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"- Yeah."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"- Than a Bobby Darin type chameleon"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"where you hear the wrong song,"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"you just totally have the wrong picture of the guy."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Somehow, yeah, I don't know why,"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"but even hearing that song, it's like,"
01:54:13;01:54:17;"it's down the middle, but it's got that Madonna vibe."
01:54:17;01:54:21;"Number two song, ""The Human League"" with ""Human."""
01:54:23;01:54:25;"Produced by Jimmy Jim and Terry Lewis."
01:54:28;01:54:35;"Human League really did their thing in the '80s."
01:54:35;01:54:37;"- Yeah, this is a good song."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"- Oh yeah."
01:54:46;01:54:52;"- So I guess this song is totally credited"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"to Jimmy Jim and Terry Lewis as songwriters."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"They just handed this to Human League."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"- Was Human League like a British pop group or what?"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"- Yeah, they were like New Wave."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"I think their first big hit was, you know,"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"that I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"- Don't You Want Me."
01:55:11;01:55:11;"- Yeah."
01:55:14;01:55:23;"- I do love this sound."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"This like sophisticated '80s balladry."
01:55:26;01:55:30;"Kind of like a Howard Jones vibe too."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"- Yeah, spanned out ballet."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"- Yeah."
01:55:36;01:55:46;"- It makes the story even more interesting."
01:55:46;01:55:51;"So Jimmy Jim and Terry Lewis wrote a song called ""Human,"""
01:55:51;01:55:53;"and then were they just like,"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"(laughing)"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"they just decided to call it Human League?"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"- Who can we give this to?"
01:55:58;01:56:01;"- Just like, hey guys, we got the perfect song for you."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"(laughing)"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"♪ I know the silence on your face ♪"

01:56:15;01:56:19;"♪ I'm only human ♪"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"- Yeah, great song."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"♪ I'm a vicious drug addict ♪"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"- With different production,"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"this could have really been like,"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"what do you call it, Jake?"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"Like a CBS song?"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"- No, this is total CBS stuff."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"I mean, if I was, yeah, my CBS playlist,"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"like this is totally on it."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"- Oh, so wait, when you speak of CBS music,"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"are you pro?"
01:56:42;01:56:45;"'Cause usually I feel like you're like disgusted by--"
01:56:45;01:56:46;"- No, no, no."
01:56:46;01:56:47;"- Oh, okay."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"You're on that CBS wave?"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"- Yeah, or like Eileen's Cars,"
01:56:49;01:56:50;"same kind of thing."
01:56:50;01:56:54;"It's like, I mean, stuff that is palatable"
01:56:54;01:56:55;"for a retail environment,"
01:56:55;01:56:59;"it's broad enough that it's not gonna offend anyone,"
01:56:59;01:57:03;"but still actually has some personality"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"and aesthetic sort of value."
01:57:05;01:57:08;"This would totally be on my CBS bangers, for sure."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"- Oh, wow, okay."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"- Like I think early in the show,"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"I made a Home Depot playlist,"
01:57:11;01:57:14;"and that was more classic rock kind of stuff,"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"but it's stuff that you could credibly hear"
01:57:16;01:57:20;"in a Home Depot, but it's still like a great playlist."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"- Copy that."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"- Okay, the number one song this week in 1986,"
01:57:23;01:57:27;"another song with the same writer and producer,"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"the man Tom Skoles from the band Boston with Amanda."
01:57:31;01:57:35;"One day we gotta go deep on Boston,"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"just like a real fascinating, weird,"
01:57:37;01:57:40;"like this idiosyncratic kind of genius"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"songwriter, producer dude."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"- Yeah."
01:57:43;01:57:47;"- Basically by himself created a few all timers,"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"but then like weird bad blood in the band."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"- Right, and then much later,"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"like the singer committed suicide."
01:57:53;01:57:54;"- Right."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"- Like in the early 2000s maybe,"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"which I always thought was so weird,"
01:57:58;01:58:01;"like this sunny, glossy music and like."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"- And I think he'd been kicked out of the band"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"at that point, so there's some people,"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"maybe it's an inappropriate speculation,"
01:58:07;01:58:10;"but being like, oh, he was like felt so abandoned"
01:58:10;01:58:13;"by Boston, but clearly this Tom dude probably felt"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"like it was his project."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"- This was the band's first officially released"
01:58:18;01:58:22;"single since '78, so they like had those first two records."
01:58:22;01:58:25;"- Also good for them for coming back and just like,"
01:58:25;01:58:29;"you know, vaguely having some light 80s touches,"
01:58:29;01:58:32;"but everything else about this song outside of like"
01:58:32;01:58:37;"some idiosyncratic drum sound choices is pure 70s."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"- Oh yeah, well it's, yeah, he recorded demos"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"for the song in 1980."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"- And as you guys pointed out on the Dirt episode,"
01:58:44;01:58:48;"Boston clearly a huge influence on Alice in Chains."
01:58:48;01:58:48;"- For sure."
01:58:48;01:58:50;"- Which I love."
01:58:50;01:58:52;"All right, we'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:58:52;01:58:55;"Thank you to Boston for this beautiful song."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"- Going out on Amanda's pretty solid."
