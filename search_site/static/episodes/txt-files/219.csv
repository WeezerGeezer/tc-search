00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:07;"Here in the middle of a long hot summer."
00:07;00:11;"On this episode, we talk Nickelback"
00:11;00:17;"and their beautiful complicated legacy, Elvis Costello,"
00:17;00:21;"as well as new music from Shaboozie."
00:21;00:24;"This is a July--"
00:24;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:35;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"They were a felt lovingly, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow."
00:59;01:02;"One of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:10;"One of us is crying."
01:10;01:13;"One of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"Leave the lonely man."
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:20;"And guess what?"
01:20;01:22;"There's been a run on the banks."
01:22;01:25;"The banks are all cleaned out."
01:25;01:29;"Bonnie and Clyde came through and emptied out all the banks"
01:29;01:32;"because we ran out of banked episodes."
01:32;01:34;"So the boys are semi-live."
01:34;01:36;"Farmer's Market Fresh, folks."
01:36;01:44;"This is a piping hot summer episode recorded"
01:44;01:45;"in the dog days of summer."
01:45;01:48;"You're hearing it in July."
01:48;01:50;"We're not that far off in July."
01:50;01:54;"Do you guys remember what any of the banked episodes were about?"
01:54;01:57;"2000s, right?"
01:57;01:58;"The songs of the early 2000s."
01:58;01:59;"But we didn't actually get to that."
01:59;02:01;"Yeah, we never quite got to it."
02:01;02:02;"We never quite got to it."
02:02;02:05;"But we wanted to."
02:05;02:08;"We took a trip down memory lane, I remember,"
02:08;02:10;"and talked about our earlier lives."
02:10;02:13;"And then another episode, we went deep on Aerosmith."
02:13;02:14;"And then another episode, we went--"
02:14;02:16;"we had Stephen Heiden."
02:16;02:17;"That's right."
02:17;02:20;"So I'm just hitting you with the bullet points there."
02:20;02:21;"We talk broad strokes."
02:21;02:22;"A little bit of Springsteen."
02:22;02:23;"Yep."
02:23;02:26;"All right, well, we tried to talk about the 2000s."
02:26;02:28;"The universe didn't want us to."
02:28;02:29;"Yeah, I guess we--"
02:29;02:31;"We did our best."
02:31;02:33;"Well, let's get back to the 2020s."
02:33;02:36;"Pretty cold decade so far."
02:36;02:40;"The roaring '20s."
02:40;02:41;"Well, how's everybody?"
02:41;02:42;"Yeah, not much going on."
02:42;02:44;"Let's just dig into this new GBV record."
02:44;02:44;"Yeah."
02:44;02:46;"Nothing going on."
02:46;02:49;"Well, OK, so where are you guys, first of all?"
02:49;02:51;"We're not in the same place."
02:51;02:53;"I'm in LA."
02:53;02:53;"Jake's in LA."
02:53;02:55;"Nick's in LA."
02:55;02:56;"Seinfeld's at his day job."
02:56;02:58;"He might jump in later."
02:58;02:59;"I'm in New York."
02:59;03:05;"I'm in the Apple Studios, New York City."
03:05;03:06;"Big Apple."
03:06;03:08;"This is what happens sometimes in the summer."
03:08;03:13;"I go from tour with the band to family tour"
03:13;03:15;"and back to tour with the band."
03:15;03:17;"So you don't go home and put your feet up and kick it"
03:17;03:19;"at home."
03:19;03:21;"It just hasn't worked out that way this year."
03:21;03:26;"But it means that I've been in so many places."
03:26;03:29;"For a guy whose passion is chilling."
03:29;03:30;"I know."
03:30;03:32;"That's rough."
03:32;03:36;"Yeah, well, that's why I need a really deep inner reservoir"
03:36;03:41;"of chill, because I've laid my head so many places."
03:41;03:43;"Papa was a Rolling Stone."
03:43;03:45;"Yeah, I mean, that's just classic."
03:45;03:49;"Sometimes within one week, you're in Bonner, Montana,"
03:49;03:52;"and then you're in Glastonbury."
03:52;03:55;"I was actually at the festival for three hours."
03:55;03:59;"I saw LCD sound system and Dua Lipa."
03:59;04:01;"That was a vibe."
04:01;04:04;"Right, and you were texting me that you were standing near Noel Gallagher."
04:04;04:05;"Yes."
04:05;04:09;"Noel Gallagher was watching LCD sound system side stage."
04:09;04:12;"So we were in the same little viewing area."
04:12;04:13;"And I clocked him."
04:13;04:15;"I mean, it was an all-star viewing area."
04:15;04:18;"Dave Grohl, very nice guy."
04:18;04:22;"But I saw Noel, and I said, I have a memory that I met him once."
04:22;04:26;"And I'm a huge fan."
04:26;04:29;"I don't know if the fact that I worked with his brother"
04:29;04:30;"would work against me."
04:30;04:32;"But he probably doesn't even know that."
04:32;04:36;"But anyway, in my head, I thought, there's Noel Gallagher."
04:36;04:40;"I'm not going to beeline it over to him when he's enjoying the LCD set."
04:40;04:41;"But who knows?"
04:41;04:44;"Maybe he'll be chilling backstage afterwards."
04:44;04:48;"And maybe somebody will introduce me, or the moment will feel right."
04:48;04:50;"And I'll say, hey, Noel, what's up?"
04:50;04:50;"I'm Ezra."
04:50;04:52;"I'm in this band, Vampire Weekend."
04:52;04:55;"We actually met a long time ago."
04:55;04:56;"Anyway, you know what's funny?"
04:56;04:59;"I've been wanting to ask you, do you know the band Guided by Voices?"
04:59;05:01;"I really was like, that's what I'm going to say."
05:01;05:04;"Only a few weeks earlier, Jake had been speculating."
05:04;05:07;"And I think this is a speculation you've done for years."
05:07;05:12;"What would Noel Gallagher say if asked, are you a GBV fan?"
05:12;05:14;"Or do you know the band?"
05:14;05:16;"Right, I had done a Twitter poll a while ago,"
05:16;05:18;"like, what do you think his thoughts are?"
05:18;05:19;"And there were three options."
05:19;05:23;"One was, they're bloody brilliant."
05:23;05:26;"Number two is, they're absolute [BLEEP].."
05:26;05:29;"And number three is, and I think this is the most likely,"
05:29;05:30;"never heard of them."
05:30;05:31;"Yeah."
05:31;05:34;"Or has heard of them, has not listened."
05:34;05:37;"Well, I think we once did an episode where we just speculated"
05:37;05:42;"that Noel probably just doesn't care that much about American music."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:45;"Which is partially what makes him cool."
05:45;05:49;"He obviously knows a ton about music."
05:49;05:50;"I can't tell."
05:50;05:51;"It kind of seems wrong."
05:51;05:53;"The dude knows so much about music."
05:53;05:56;"He's obviously such a fan of music that there's"
05:56;06:03;"no way he's not fairly aware of the history of American rock and roll."
06:03;06:08;"But then by the same token, there is such a proudly British thing"
06:08;06:09;"about Oasis."
06:09;06:10;"[MUSIC - OASIS, ""HELLO CROWD""]"
06:10;06:17;"Easy now, heavy is the head that wears a hollow crown."
06:17;06:20;"There must be something in the air."
06:20;06:24;"There's talk of revolution here."
06:24;06:25;"Talk about the clouds."
06:25;06:39;"Rainy eyes, always be prepared to see through everybody's lies."
06:39;06:41;"Soon your future will appear."
06:41;06:45;"There's nothing left for you to fear."
06:45;06:50;"I start to say a prayer for everybody there."
06:50;06:55;"Your destination comes without a fail."
06:55;07:03;"Now I saw you up and down the lane, but I don't know your name."
07:03;07:10;"All the places that you have, it makes me ashamed."
07:10;07:16;"All the love you ever made, by what you gave away,"
07:16;07:21;"but I wonder what you find."
07:21;07:27;"Yeah, so I actually Googled it, and I ended up on the Oasis Reddit."
07:27;07:29;"And someone three years ago--"
07:29;07:32;"and I've thought a lot of these thoughts before, and I like Oasis."
07:32;07:36;"Someone really made a compelling case, any GBV fans out there."
07:36;07:39;"I've always been surprised that there haven't been more comparisons"
07:39;07:42;"between ""Guarded by Voices"" and Noel Gallagher,"
07:42;07:45;"both obsessive record collectors of British and American rock"
07:45;07:47;"music from the '60s and '70s."
07:47;07:49;"Both write songs that are basically putting"
07:49;07:52;"the entire record collections in a blender and seeing what happens."
07:52;07:56;"Both proudly work in class from unglamorous places--"
07:56;07:59;"Burnage, Lanx, and Dayton, Ohio."
07:59;08:02;"Both worked for a living before becoming rock stars."
08:02;08:07;"Both very much subscribe to the cigarettes plus alcohol plus rock"
08:07;08:08;"music mantra."
08:08;08:11;"Both have a ridiculous gift for melody."
08:11;08:13;"Both put less importance on the meaning of lyrics"
08:13;08:15;"than the way the words sound."
08:15;08:19;"Both put out masterpieces in 1994 and followed up"
08:19;08:22;"with masterpieces in '95."
08:22;08:25;"Both have a certain similar attitude towards production--"
08:25;08:27;"certainly Noel in '94."
08:27;08:32;"Minimal bass, big chords, focus on vocal, blah, blah, blah."
08:32;08:36;"Both put on incredibly drunken sing-along messes of live shows."
08:36;08:37;"A lot of crossover."
08:37;08:38;"I could see it."
08:38;08:40;"I mean, yeah, maybe--"
08:40;08:41;"how could he not know?"
08:41;08:45;"He must have heard the name at some point."
08:45;08:45;"Yeah."
08:45;08:50;"And if there was any American indie rock band that he might be into,"
08:50;08:51;"it would be them."
08:51;08:54;"Kind of hard for me to picture him wrapping his head around pavement."
08:54;08:57;"I could see him sort of dismissively being like,"
08:57;08:59;"oh, this is laconic slacker music."
08:59;09:00;"They're-- you know."
09:00;09:01;"Yeah, and then he hears GBV."
09:01;09:04;"He's like, yeah, it's a bit rock and roll, isn't it?"
09:04;09:09;"I could see him being dismissive of pavement and hating Sonic Youth."
09:09;09:11;"Oh, yeah."
09:11;09:14;"Yeah, because I feel like he could barely tolerate Radiohead."
09:14;09:15;"Oh, yeah, he hated Radiohead."
09:15;09:16;"Yeah."
09:16;09:17;"I could see Sonic Youth just--"
09:17;09:24;"he would just see it as so pretentious, artsy, like, what is this [BLEEP]??"
09:24;09:28;"I've been looking up, trying to find if Noel in the past"
09:28;09:31;"had said anything about LCD sound system."
09:31;09:32;"I was just looking it up."
09:32;09:36;"And every time I looked it up, the number one thing that comes up"
09:36;09:39;"is obviously that he was in Glass and very watching."
09:39;09:41;"But all of the articles go, Noel Gallagher"
09:41;09:44;"has zero interest in Dave Grohl."
09:44;09:46;"Oh, boy."
09:46;09:46;"That was his big--"
09:46;09:49;"I think they were both backstage at LCD."
09:49;09:52;"No, no, I was standing within five feet of each of them."
09:52;09:53;"Eyewitness here, folks."
09:53;09:54;"Yes, they were together."
09:54;09:58;"I could have done a Bob Marley, bring the two rival political factions"
09:58;10:01;"together, take both their hands, hold them up."
10:01;10:03;"Come on, Noel, be interested in him."
10:03;10:04;"At a certain point, every--"
10:04;10:07;"you know, these, like, legendary rich dude rock stars"
10:07;10:10;"are all kind of on the same circuit."
10:10;10:13;"So maybe Dave is just like, whatever."
10:13;10:14;"You were part of this--"
10:14;10:15;"this is real."
10:15;10:16;"This is a quote."
10:16;10:18;"""I did actually bump into Dave,"" Noel said."
10:18;10:22;"He was about three feet away from me when I was watching LCD sound system."
10:22;10:24;"Oh, oh, he talked about it."
10:24;10:27;"No, he goes-- and he was staying in the same hotel I was in."
10:27;10:29;"I haven't got [BLEEP] all to say to him."
10:29;10:33;"OK."
10:33;10:35;"Just keeping it a little too real in the press."
10:35;10:39;"I got zero interest in talking to him."
10:39;10:42;"Well, you know who did have something to say to you, Noel?"
10:42;10:45;"Me, Ezra."
10:45;10:48;"I had a question to ask you."
10:48;10:51;"Hey, Noel, some friends of mine have a year's long speculation"
10:51;10:58;"about your familiarity with an American indie rock band guided by voices."
10:58;11:00;"Do you have a few minutes to chat?"
11:00;11:03;"Yeah, maybe he would have been like, now this is the type of chat"
11:03;11:04;"I'm talking about."
11:04;11:07;"Dave Grohl comes up, I got [BLEEP] all to say to him."
11:07;11:14;"But you, you're bringing real, substantive conversation, mate."
11:14;11:16;"This is why I come to music festivals."
11:16;11:18;"[MUSIC - DAVE GROHL, ""I'VE WAITED TOO LONG""]"
11:18;11:22;"I've waited too long to have you right in the back of me."
11:22;11:24;"I've waited too long."
11:24;11:28;"I wonder how you keep track of me."
11:28;11:32;"You could never be strong."
11:32;11:35;"You could not make me free."
11:35;11:42;"And I'd never ask for the truth, but you have lied to me."
11:42;11:46;"Maybe I should have asked Dave Grohl about guided by voices."
11:46;11:48;"That would have been interesting, too, actually."
11:48;11:50;"Oh, yeah, man."
11:50;11:51;"That one's easier to picture."
11:51;11:52;"There's less of a question mark."
11:52;11:54;"He'd be like, oh, yeah, of course."
11:54;11:55;"Some good tunes, man."
11:55;11:55;"Yeah."
11:55;11:58;"He would know the name of a couple of records, and yeah."
11:58;11:59;"Yeah."
11:59;12:01;"OK, here, I got the quote."
12:01;12:04;"I have this feeling before this quote I'm about to read you"
12:04;12:08;"that really what matters for Noel is popularity, right?"
12:08;12:10;"He cares about what cuts through."
12:10;12:13;"So I could see him being like, well, however, who gives a shit?"
12:13;12:14;"They're not popular."
12:14;12:20;"And then in the Mercury Sun out of Portland in--"
12:20;12:21;"Just the Portland Mercury."
12:21;12:26;"Yeah, the Portland Mercury 2012."
12:26;12:27;"Here's a quote."
12:27;12:28;"Because that's what counts."
12:28;12:30;"Popular culture is what counts."
12:30;12:33;"Anything else is just who wants to be a cult band."
12:33;12:34;"Fuck that."
12:34;12:35;"You know what I mean?"
12:35;12:37;"There are thousands of great records written every day"
12:37;12:38;"that nobody owns."
12:38;12:40;"I still think band should aim to be the Beatles, not fucking,"
12:40;12:42;"I don't know, pavement."
12:42;12:43;"Wait, that's what he said?"
12:43;12:44;"Yes."
12:44;12:45;"Noel?"
12:45;12:46;"Yes."
12:46;12:46;"Wow."
12:46;12:47;"All right, well, then, yeah."
12:47;12:50;"If you're indie, he's not interested."
12:50;12:56;"Just a Stephen Malek-mas living his quiet life in Portland,"
12:56;13:03;"a revered indie rock star in the most indie rock city in America,"
13:03;13:08;"just waking up with his local paper on Sunday on his home turf."
13:08;13:12;"Last thing he's thinking about is fucking Oasis."
13:12;13:14;"Oh, Noel Gallagher."
13:14;13:16;"God, shots fired."
13:16;13:17;"What's he got to say?"
13:17;13:18;"Ouch."
13:18;13:19;"That's really lame of Noel."
13:19;13:21;"I mean, come on, man."
13:21;13:25;"Like, don't you remember when you were a young obscure band?"
13:25;13:25;"I don't know."
13:25;13:27;"Maybe Oasis wasn't ever obscure."
13:27;13:28;"Maybe they just came out of the--"
13:28;13:29;"Here's another great quote."
13:29;13:33;"My battleground is the charts, and guitar music at the top of the charts"
13:33;13:36;"is virtually non-existent unless you fucking count Green Day,"
13:36;13:39;"which nobody should."
13:39;13:41;"Well, so then he's in a lose-lose situation."
13:41;13:42;"He can't like anything."
13:42;13:45;"He only likes music that's popular, but none of them are rock bands."
13:45;13:49;"So, like, I guess you're just listening to Stones records?"
13:49;13:51;"I mean, I'm right on."
13:51;13:52;"I guess that's the sort of situation I'm in."
13:53;13:55;"[LAUGHTER]"
13:55;13:59;"You know, like, I guess he wouldn't be him if he didn't feel that way."
13:59;14:01;"Right."
14:01;14:03;"You know, Oasis, like, one of their early singles"
14:03;14:05;"is called ""Rock and Roll Star."""
14:05;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:10;"There is kind of like an understanding, like, go big or go home."
14:10;14:12;"I bet he probably practiced what he preaches up to a point."
14:12;14:14;"He has slowed down a bit."
14:14;14:16;"You know, he's just hanging out."
14:16;14:18;"Got a ton of money."
14:18;14:21;"And he's like, we're not at the top of the charts anymore."
14:21;14:22;"What's the point?"
14:22;14:23;"I just-- yeah."
14:23;14:28;"I mean, I find that ultimately a very kind of depressing worldview."
14:28;14:29;"But--"
14:29;14:29;"Well, it's also very--"
14:29;14:33;"He doesn't have like a substantive relationship with music."
14:33;14:35;"This is sort of like--"
14:35;14:38;"I mean, maybe he's just kind of like doing a self-parody to like be"
14:38;14:40;"funny and interesting in the interview."
14:40;14:44;"Yeah, there's a little bit of that classic, you know,"
14:44;14:47;"playing it up for the interview."
14:47;14:48;"I think also in--"
14:48;14:49;"For the Portland Mercury."
14:49;14:50;"For the Portland Mercury."
14:50;14:53;"It's also a very English perspective."
14:53;14:56;"And I always feel this way a little bit when I'm at Glastonbury."
14:56;14:59;"It crossed my mind where, on the one hand,"
14:59;15:02;"England is a really big country and an incredibly"
15:02;15:05;"influential and important country."
15:05;15:09;"I mean, you look at the history of England, for better and for worse,"
15:09;15:12;"you know, conquered the globe."
15:12;15:17;"The random, you know, hodgepodge language that developed in the British Isles"
15:17;15:21;"became the lingua franca of the whole world."
15:21;15:29;"You know, the England popular culture, world shaking, you know."
15:29;15:33;"The Beatles, Dua Lipa, Coldplay, you name it."
15:33;15:34;"Shakespeare."
15:34;15:36;"Shakespeare."
15:36;15:43;"So on the one hand, England feels like, in a sense, as big as America."
15:43;15:46;"But then because England is such a smaller country,"
15:46;15:48;"then you're at a thing like Glastonbury and you realize, like, yeah,"
15:48;15:53;"this is also-- there's like a local flavor as well where you're kind of like,"
15:53;15:58;"right, England, in that sense, England feels small."
15:58;16:01;"So I guess all I'm saying is it's like big and small at the same time."
16:01;16:03;"There's like a little bit of like America in it."
16:03;16:07;"Massive, just like forced to be reckoned with type country."
16:07;16:10;"Then there's a little bit of like a smaller European country"
16:10;16:14;"that has its own local celebrities, local customs, whatever."
16:14;16:18;"So I think when you're in England, sometimes I think as an artist,"
16:18;16:20;"you know, it's not a big country to cover."
16:20;16:26;"So there's more of a monoculture there where, you know,"
16:26;16:31;"an indie band can have like number ones on the charts."
16:31;16:34;"Like, you know, for instance, the English kind of post-punk band,"
16:34;16:37;"Idols, they have number one records."
16:37;16:40;"And they're like, they're going to be on your radar"
16:40;16:41;"if you remotely follow music."
16:41;16:45;"Like, whereas in America, the distance between like the spotlight"
16:45;16:48;"and everything else is so huge."
16:48;16:48;"Yeah."
16:48;16:52;"That, you know, like if you live in Ohio, I don't know,"
16:52;16:53;"you might never go to New York."
16:53;16:56;"But if you're like in a band from even like the smallest town,"
16:56;16:59;"at some point you'll rip into London and do a gig."
16:59;17:01;"So I guess all I'm saying is like there, I can understand why"
17:01;17:05;"from that English perspective, he's kind of like, listen, it's not that tough."
17:05;17:08;"Either you connect with the audience, you're big or you're not."
17:08;17:13;"Whereas in America, it's kind of like the idea of being like a dude"
17:13;17:17;"in a guitar band who's kind of like, why aren't we at the top of the charts?"
17:17;17:18;"You'd be like, what are you even talking about?"
17:18;17:21;"You know, we're like a local band from Arizona."
17:21;17:22;"It's just, it's just different."
17:22;17:24;"America is a much bigger country."
17:24;17:30;"So being a cult band in America maybe feels more dignified or something."
17:30;17:32;"You got more room."
17:32;17:35;"There's more room in the shadows in America."
17:35;17:37;"Yeah, that's well put."
17:37;17:37;"Yeah, because you're right."
17:37;17:41;"Like the Smiths had like number one records in England in like the 80s."
17:41;17:41;"Yeah."
17:41;17:47;"Oh, Superman by Laurie Anderson was number one on the UK charts in 1980 or whatever."
17:47;17:48;"That's amazing."
17:48;17:50;"Those things happen."
17:50;17:53;"In America, those things essentially never happen."
17:53;17:53;"Yeah."
17:53;17:54;"It's a, I don't know."
17:54;17:55;"Yeah."
17:55;17:58;"It's a smaller, it's a smaller place."
18:56;19:00;"One day, I'll ask him about Guided by Voices."
19:00;19:03;"And maybe one day we'll see if we can get him on the show."
19:03;19:06;"That'd be a fun episode, just kind of pick his brain."
19:06;19:11;"The guys want to interview about Guided by Voices."
19:11;19:16;"And honestly, even if you're not a fan, they'll play you a lot of music"
19:16;19:18;"from throughout the band's career."
19:18;19:20;"You can comment in real time."
19:20;19:22;"Like, you just play him like one song, he's like, sucks."
19:22;19:24;"And you're like, OK, well, hold on, man."
19:24;19:26;"We're just getting started."
19:26;19:29;"Matt, throw on Gold Star for Robot Boy."
19:29;19:33;"This one, I've always thought, since I first heard it 30 years ago,"
19:33;19:35;"sounded like Oasis to me."
19:35;19:38;"[MUSIC - GOLD STAR, ""ROBOT BOY""]"
19:53;19:56;"That's sort of like droney and like--"
19:56;20:00;"Bob has kind of like a more nasal approach on this one."
20:00;20:06;"I mean, the reason I guess I could see Noel liking GBV"
20:06;20:10;"is that it's one of the only indie bands I feel like aspirations were to be pop."
20:10;20:11;"Yeah, right."
20:11;20:16;"You know, where pavement is trying, you know, maybe not being arty,"
20:16;20:20;"but being weird and, you know, ironic."
20:20;20:21;"You know what I mean?"
20:21;20:24;"There's something about this-- yeah."
20:24;20:25;"They're aiming."
20:25;20:27;"They're shooting for it."
20:27;20:33;"Yeah, they're aiming for the stars from the Dayton basement."
20:33;20:37;"Maybe he could appreciate that, even if they didn't top the charts."
20:37;20:39;"He can appreciate the reach."
20:39;20:42;"[MUSIC - GOLD STAR, ""ROBOT BOY""]"
20:45;20:47;"It sounds like a wasted demo."
20:47;20:49;"Right."
20:49;20:53;"But I could also just picture playing this for Noel,"
20:53;20:55;"and you're just like, you know what, man?"
20:55;20:56;"I just really see a parallel."
20:56;20:58;"And he's just listening to this, and he's like,"
20:58;21:00;"what the [BLEEP] are you talking about?"
21:00;21:01;"Yeah, totally."
21:01;21:02;"I can see that, too."
21:02;21:03;"Just like--"
21:03;21:04;"Oh, absolutely."
21:04;21:06;"This is a raucous mess."
21:06;21:07;"This sounds like garbage."
21:07;21:10;"Do not relate."
21:10;21:13;"Put on-- what was the first big single?"
21:13;21:15;"I mean, there was ""Rock and Roll Star."""
21:15;21:20;"There was also-- I'm blanking right now."
21:20;21:21;"On the first album, there's--"
21:21;21:22;"Yeah."
21:22;21:23;"(SINGING) Gonna live forever."
21:23;21:24;"Oh, right, right, right."
21:24;21:30;"""Shaker Maker,"" ""Up in the Sky,"" Columbia's ""Supersonic."""
21:30;21:33;"Yeah, that one, or ""Gonna Live Forever."""
21:33;21:34;"Here's ""Live Forever."""
21:34;21:36;"This is going to be so much louder and like--"
21:36;21:39;"[MUSIC - ""LIVE FOREVER""]"
21:39;21:46;"(SINGING) Well, maybe."
21:46;21:48;"(SINGING) Maybe."
21:48;21:52;"I don't really want to know how you got and grow."
21:52;21:54;"There is something about the vocal delivery."
21:54;21:55;"Yeah."
21:55;21:57;"(SINGING) Gold star for robot boy."
21:57;21:59;"(SINGING) Maybe."
21:59;22:04;"Did you ever feel the pain in the modern rain?"
22:04;22:06;"Although Bob only really would do that vocal delivery"
22:06;22:07;"on that song."
22:07;22:10;"(SINGING) Maybe I just want to breathe."
22:10;22:14;"Boy, this is Liam's real go-to gear."
22:14;22:16;"(SINGING) I just want to breathe."
22:16;22:18;"Maybe I just don't believe."
22:18;22:21;"Maybe you're the same as me."
22:21;22:24;"We see things I'll never see."
22:24;22:28;"You and I are gonna live forever."
22:28;22:30;"I feel like Oasis wouldn't really go to the falsetto"
22:30;22:31;"very often."
22:31;22:32;"Yeah."
22:32;22:34;"That's kind of interesting."
22:34;22:38;"(SINGING) I don't really want to know how you got and grow."
22:38;22:41;"Wait, was there an Oasis reunion announced or not?"
22:41;22:42;"Did I imagine that?"
22:42;22:46;"There's always like some speculation"
22:46;22:47;"that it's like about to happen."
22:47;22:48;"Right."
22:48;22:49;"So there's nothing official."
22:49;22:51;"I think maybe-- you know, people are obsessed"
22:51;22:52;"with the quotes and stuff."
22:52;22:55;"So I think maybe recently one of them said like,"
22:55;22:56;"""It could happen."""
22:56;22:58;"And people were like, ""Oh, [BLEEP]."""
22:58;22:59;"Uh-huh."
22:59;23:00;"That kind of thing."
23:00;23:04;"Well, here we are in the deep in the summer."
23:04;23:06;"Yeah."
23:06;23:08;"Hot almost everywhere."
23:08;23:12;"I think people slowing down, sweating,"
23:12;23:15;"desperately trying to cool off."
23:15;23:18;"But this is the time when the songs of the summer"
23:18;23:20;"really emerge."
23:20;23:22;"And I was thinking, you know, on Time Crest,"
23:22;23:24;"we could talk about the songs of the summer."
23:24;23:29;"I mean, I think from what I've heard,"
23:29;23:30;"from my soldiers in the streets,"
23:30;23:33;"it seems fairly conclusive that Sabrina Carpenter,"
23:33;23:36;"""Espresso"" is the song of the summer."
23:36;23:38;"You know, it's a catchy song."
23:38;23:40;"But you know what?"
23:40;23:44;"Like, you can go other places to hear about ""Espresso."""
23:44;23:45;"Maybe we'll talk about it later."
23:45;23:50;"But I think what the people want from a semi-live time crisis"
23:50;23:53;"is to know about our songs of the summer."
23:53;23:55;"And I don't know, maybe Sabrina Carpenter, ""Espresso"""
23:55;23:58;"will be on Jake's songs of the summer."
23:58;24:01;"But you know, like, you have your own personal songs"
24:01;24:03;"of the summer, and sometimes they're new,"
24:03;24:04;"sometimes they're old."
24:04;24:08;"Sometimes, you know, something reaches out of you"
24:08;24:11;"from the past and kind of wants to be part"
24:11;24:14;"of summer 2024."
24:14;24:17;"So I put that out to the group."
24:17;24:20;"What are your personal songs of this summer?"
24:20;24:22;"Yeah, I love this idea."
24:22;24:24;"I haven't heard ""Espresso."""
24:24;24:26;"You haven't heard it once?"
24:26;24:30;"They should do a remix for the summer called ""Iced Espresso."""
24:30;24:31;"Am I right, folks?"
24:31;24:34;"[laughs]"
24:34;24:35;"I haven't heard it."
24:35;24:37;"Should we listen to it for a minute?"
24:37;24:40;"Or should we just dive into our own songs?"
24:40;24:42;"Yeah, I kind of want to hear your reaction a little bit."
24:42;24:43;"Okay."
24:43;24:45;"You really haven't heard it?"
24:45;24:46;"Not that I'm aware of."
24:46;24:47;"Right."
24:47;24:50;"I've been in some Ubers recently, so it's possible."
24:50;24:53;"Summer Uber."
24:53;24:54;"Okay, maybe you've heard it."
24:54;25:01;"♪"
25:01;25:02;"Okay, a little throwback."
25:02;25:03;"Here we go."
25:03;25:09;"♪"
25:09;25:11;"A little bit of funk pop."
25:11;25:14;"♪"
25:14;25:16;"Definitely a summertime vibe."
25:16;25:19;"I mean, it's very possible I heard this in the Rite Aid or whatever,"
25:19;25:23;"and I just didn't-- I paid it no mind."
25:23;25:30;"♪"
25:30;25:31;"Ooh."
25:31;25:38;"♪"
25:45;25:50;"♪"
25:55;26:02;"♪"
26:02;26:06;"One thought I have listening to this is that if you thought that"
26:06;26:11;"pop music's obsession with the '80s and the '80s becoming like the"
26:11;26:16;"new center of gravity for music was over and it had moved on to the '90s"
26:16;26:22;"via Olivia Rodrigo and the kind of grunge pop stuff,"
26:22;26:23;"nope."
26:23;26:24;"Nope."
26:24;26:30;"The '80s is the sun of our modern solar system, and that will continue."
26:30;26:36;"There might be a little moment of a '90s thing, but this is still--"
26:36;26:40;"this is still like an early '80s post-disco vibe,"
26:40;26:42;"and this is the song of the summer."
26:42;26:44;"Don't bet against the '80s."
26:44;26:53;"♪"
26:53;26:57;"Yeah, I mean, it's very possible-- I find this so innocuous that it's very"
26:57;27:03;"possible I heard it and I just-- in one ear, out the other."
27:03;27:09;"One thing that I thought was cool about Sabrina Carpenter is she--"
27:09;27:13;"now with the huge success of this song, ""Espresso,"" and some other singles,"
27:13;27:17;"she released her album, which is called ""Short and Sweet,"""
27:17;27:19;"and I think she might be short."
27:19;27:21;"Actually, Nick, can you be the sign?"
27:21;27:24;"I'm going to give you a number crunch on Sabrina Carpenter ""Height."""
27:24;27:27;"Also, what's the run time on that album?"
27:27;27:28;"Oh, that's a good question."
27:28;27:30;"It better be under 40."
27:30;27:34;"What would you consider short?"
27:34;27:36;"5'2""?"
27:36;27:38;"5'4""?"
27:38;27:39;"4'11""."
27:39;27:40;"That's short."
27:40;27:45;"Yeah, I mean, that's-- I wouldn't even call 5'2"" short."
27:45;27:46;"I guess for a woman, yeah."
27:46;27:47;"4'11""."
27:47;27:48;"That's short."
27:48;27:50;"She earned the title."
27:50;27:52;"The top eight pop stars are 4'11""."
27:52;27:55;"Kylie Minogue, I believe, is 4'11""."
27:55;27:58;"And Shakira, also 4'11""."
27:58;28:00;"Wow."
28:00;28:04;"Yeah, not hitting 5 feet is-- that's short."
28:04;28:10;"It's like that 4, that number 4, in the front of your height."
28:10;28:11;"That's wild."
28:11;28:14;"Yeah, but these are some of the biggest pop stars in the world, so--"
28:14;28:15;"I'm not knocking them."
28:15;28:17;"I'm not knocking the height."
28:17;28:19;"What's the run time on that record?"
28:19;28:21;"Well, I guess the record's actually not out yet."
28:21;28:22;"It comes out in August."
28:22;28:25;"Can anybody-- have they leaked the run time?"
28:25;28:30;"It's only 12 songs, so it's not one of those crazy, super loaded pop albums"
28:30;28:33;"with like 20, 21 songs."
28:33;28:37;"They have not leaked the run time."
28:37;28:38;"But I like that."
28:38;28:39;"Short and sweet."
28:39;28:41;"Yeah, no, it's a good title."
28:41;28:45;"Well, the song ""Espresso"" is 2 minutes 55 seconds, so that's short and sweet."
28:45;28:47;"I like that."
28:47;28:50;"I would have loved it if it was 1.55."
28:50;28:53;"So that's perhaps the song of the summer."
28:53;28:54;"Okay."
28:54;28:58;"And I could-- it's definitely summery, and it's got that slightly--"
28:58;29:01;"it's a certain type of summery vibe that's-- it's funny,"
29:01;29:04;"because the song's called ""Espresso,"" so I think it's kind of about like,"
29:04;29:08;"you know, she's like that burst of energy that you need."
29:08;29:11;"Like, she's got that-- like, she is espresso."
29:11;29:13;"It's that-- what did she say?"
29:13;29:15;"It's that me, espresso."
29:15;29:18;"Like, she's a short shot full of caffeine."
29:18;29:22;"But the music is-- yeah, has a kind of like laconic vibe."
29:22;29:26;"It makes me think a little bit about this Style Council song."
29:26;29:29;"I always think about this song like almost every summer."
29:29;29:31;"It's called ""Long Hot Summer."""
29:31;29:35;"You know, Style Council is like Paul Weller's band after the jam."
29:35;29:37;"Oh, no, I don't know this."
29:37;29:39;"So what year is this?"
29:39;29:43;"I don't know, mid-- '80, '84?"
29:43;29:45;"# I play out my role"
29:45;29:48;"# I've even been out walking"
29:48;29:51;"# Tell me that it helps"
29:51;29:53;"# But I know when I'm done"
29:53;29:59;"Like, that slightly laid-back, slow,"
29:59;30:02;"maybe a touch sad summer energy."
30:02;30:05;"# All those lonely parties"
30:05;30:08;"# And the feelings I've screamed"
30:08;30:09;"This is '83."
30:10;30:15;"# I don't want to take anymore"
30:15;30:19;"# Mm, I want to make stuff inside"
30:19;30:22;"So this is slower than ""Espresso,"" but--"
30:22;30:25;"# I don't know how much, which part"
30:25;30:27;"# I can't escape the truth"
30:27;30:30;"# And the fact is, no matter what I do"
30:30;30:33;"# Don't matter what I do"
30:33;30:35;"# Don't matter what I do"
30:35;30:37;"This was a big hit in the U.K.?"
30:37;30:38;"Yeah."
30:38;30:41;"# Don't matter what I do"
30:41;30:44;"# 'Cause I end up hurting"
30:44;30:46;"Like, that's a very specific summer feeling."
30:46;30:49;"A little bit sad, a little bit slow,"
30:49;30:51;"but definitely summer, somehow."
30:51;30:54;"I always think about that, and I think about, of course,"
30:54;30:56;"Lana Del Rey's ""Summertime Sadness."""
30:56;31:00;"# Got that summertime, summertime sadness"
31:00;31:02;"Sounds like a Jonathan Richman song."
31:02;31:04;"Oh, yeah, it is pretty Richman."
31:04;31:07;"Oh, he's got that song ""Summertime Feeling,"" right?"
31:07;31:08;"Yeah."
31:08;31:11;"Summer's a weird-- is a weird season"
31:11;31:13;"because it's full of fun."
31:13;31:17;"There's a side of it that's summer fun, summer loving,"
31:17;31:20;"going down the boardwalk,"
31:20;31:25;"fun, carefree days, you know, if you're school age."
31:25;31:29;"And yet, summer's also intense, you know?"
31:29;31:33;"It's not like a beautiful spring day full of promise."
31:33;31:35;"Summer's, like, heavy."
31:35;31:37;"You can feel kind of like--"
31:37;31:41;"Summer is the-- summer and winter are yin-yang."
31:41;31:43;"Like, in winter, you literally can be frozen."
31:43;31:45;"You're so cold, you can't move."
31:45;31:47;"And in summer, it can be so hot"
31:47;31:50;"that you're also kind of, like, suspended"
31:50;31:52;"in a kind of invisible jelly."
31:52;31:57;"And things slow down, and it's--"
31:57;31:59;"it's eerie, kind of."
31:59;32:03;"Anyway, Jake, what's one of your summer gems this year?"
32:03;32:05;"Two came to mind."
32:05;32:08;"Well, we just did a GBV thing, so I'm going to--"
32:08;32:10;"so there's a new record I've been listening to a lot,"
32:10;32:11;"but I'm going to skip that."
32:11;32:14;"There's a great song on there called ""Fictional Environment"
32:14;32:16;"Dream,"" but we're not going to do that one,"
32:16;32:17;"because we just did some."
32:17;32:19;"I have two that come to mind."
32:19;32:22;"There's a new Little Wings album called ""High on the Glade,"""
32:22;32:25;"and there's a bunch of great songs on there."
32:25;32:28;"But the one I picked was ""Handful of Earth,"""
32:28;32:32;"which I don't know if the-- sonically, this is summery."
32:32;32:34;"But you've been listening to it a lot this summer."
32:34;32:36;"But I've been listening to it a lot this summer."
32:36;32:37;"Oh, that's all that matters."
32:37;32:39;"""Handful of Earth"" from Little Wings."
32:39;32:41;"[MUSIC - LITTLE WINGS, ""HANDFUL OF EARTH""]"
32:41;32:43;"It's been on heavy rotation here, too."
32:43;32:44;"Oh, yes, this is brand new."
32:44;32:48;"(SINGING) Think clover and blade, if you will."
32:48;32:52;"Harmony green as you must."
32:52;32:57;"I cried as I walked up that hill, where everything"
32:57;33:00;"had turned to dust."
33:00;33:03;"Looking back over the years."
33:03;33:05;"We're going to just cool down."
33:05;33:06;"We're at the bar."
33:06;33:08;"Mm-hmm."
33:08;33:10;"Flamin' Modellos just singing this."
33:10;33:11;"This has a summer--"
33:11;33:14;"Yeah, this has an Irish drinking song feel."
33:14;33:20;"(SINGING) Oh, handful of earth, what is it worth?"
33:20;33:24;"This life is contained by our death and our birth."
33:24;33:28;"To wake on this morning and kiss at the dawn"
33:28;33:31;"of this handful of earth that I found."
33:31;33:38;"Think heaven and song if you can."
33:38;33:42;"Music eternally ascending."
33:42;33:46;"The devil turned into a man."
33:46;33:50;"And every branch started bending."
33:50;33:54;"Look at my face if you're able."
33:54;33:57;"I'm hardly blameless at all."
33:57;34:02;"Spinning my foot on the table and laughing"
34:02;34:05;"at trees when they fall."
34:05;34:09;"Handful of earth, what is it worth?"
34:09;34:13;"This life is contained by our death and our birth."
34:13;34:17;"To wake on this morning and kiss at the ground"
34:17;34:20;"for this handful of earth that I found."
34:23;34:28;"Now that I've found it at last, here"
34:28;34:32;"comes the mercury showing."
34:32;34:39;"Hiding and changing so fast, chaos behind it a-towing."
34:39;34:43;"By joy we've got it again."
34:43;34:47;"Everything fits in a circle."
34:47;34:51;"And while there is nothing to win,"
34:51;34:55;"nothing to lose is eternal."
34:55;34:59;"Beautiful work, Kyle."
34:59;35:01;"Yeah, it's not-- it's a heavy song."
35:01;35:04;"It's not like some breezy--"
35:04;35:06;"Yeah, but I think that makes sense."
35:06;35:08;"Summer's a heavy season."
35:08;35:09;"There you go, yeah."
35:09;35:11;"I mean, there's another song on this record"
35:11;35:13;"that is more summery."
35:13;35:14;"Yeah, what's that one called?"
35:14;35:17;"That goes, between you and me and the coconut tree,"
35:17;35:19;"it's a jungle out there."
35:19;35:21;"Coconut tree, dude."
35:21;35:23;"It's called Coconut-- oh, I see it."
35:23;35:25;"Yeah, yeah."
35:25;35:27;"This is a little more summery."
35:27;35:37;"To picture peace is easy, although some will hardly dare."
35:37;35:41;"I thought I'd teach the world to sing,"
35:41;35:46;"but that barely seems fair."
35:46;35:50;"For what the song and ding-dong ditch"
35:50;35:54;"and ding-a-ling to pair,"
35:54;36:01;"between you and me and the coconut tree,"
36:01;36:03;"it's a jungle out there."
36:08;36:17;"A nanny child and babysitter visit an au pair"
36:17;36:27;"to weave more oil than lavender into a maiden's hair."
36:27;36:35;"Snake oil gets expensive, but the burden they will bear."
36:35;36:41;"Between you and me and the coconut tree,"
36:41;36:43;"it's a jungle out there."
36:43;36:51;"Yeah, Kyle has this, like, couple different modes."
36:51;36:55;"This is kind of his Uncle Kyle sing-along, sweet songs,"
36:55;36:58;"and then he's got his more, like, existentially,"
36:58;37:02;"kind of headier songs, like Handful of Earth."
37:02;37:07;"This could be in the opening credits to a TV show."
37:07;37:09;"Between you and me and the coconut tree,"
37:09;37:10;"it's a jungle out there."
37:10;37:12;"It's a jungle out there, man."
37:12;37:20;"Could be Jake, you and Kyle start a detective agency."
37:20;37:23;"Just two chilled-out, laid-back guys."
37:23;37:25;"It's a mystery comedy. It's like Lebowski."
37:25;37:28;"Yeah, it's a mystery comedy."
37:28;37:31;"Takes place in L.A."
37:31;37:33;"This is the opening credits."
37:33;37:35;"It's a very complicated case, man."
37:35;37:37;"A lot of ins, a lot of outs."
37:37;37:38;"A lot of what-have-yous."
37:38;37:40;"It's a jungle out there."
37:40;37:43;"[laughs]"
37:43;37:45;"It seems like a great album for summer."
37:45;37:47;"It's a great record."
37:47;37:48;"High on the glade."
37:48;37:50;"Yep, high on the glade, folks."
37:50;37:54;"All right, so, Nick, you picked a song that I think"
37:54;37:56;"is maybe in contention for Song of the Summer,"
37:56;37:58;"a more mainstream one."
37:58;38:00;"Yeah, I mean, when it comes to my songs of the summer,"
38:00;38:03;"I think I'm pretty down the middle."
38:03;38:07;"I stay engaged in what's being played"
38:07;38:08;"in the Ubers around me."
38:08;38:10;"Okay, Noel Gallagher, settle down."
38:10;38:13;"Are you playing ""Espresso"" by Sabrina Carpenter"
38:13;38:14;"at your house?"
38:14;38:17;"No, that one kind of--"
38:17;38:18;"I mean, obviously, I'm aware,"
38:18;38:20;"but didn't really cross my desk."
38:20;38:25;"I think I'm probably slightly in the more country side"
38:25;38:29;"of the pop music that's being played."
38:29;38:30;"Noted Zach Bryan fan."
38:31;38:32;"But I would say--"
38:32;38:35;"And as a Southerner."
38:35;38:37;"And as the resident Southern"
38:37;38:39;"due to the time crisis,"
38:39;38:43;"I do think this Shaboosie bar song--"
38:43;38:44;"have either of you heard it?"
38:44;38:45;"No."
38:45;38:46;"I have heard it."
38:46;38:49;"So I was at Stagecoach."
38:49;38:50;"My--"
38:50;38:51;"Samantha and I were at Stagecoach,"
38:51;38:53;"which is a country music festival"
38:53;38:55;"that goes on right after Coachella,"
38:55;38:56;"and he came out,"
38:56;38:58;"and it's the first time I'd ever heard it."
38:58;39:00;"And it was not particularly--"
39:00;39:02;"It's one of those moments where it's like people there,"
39:02;39:03;"I think, know it,"
39:03;39:05;"but it's not a popular song."
39:05;39:06;"I never heard it."
39:06;39:08;"And it was sort of immediate"
39:08;39:11;"that this is going to be a very big song."
39:11;39:14;"And I think over--"
39:14;39:15;"I don't know, the last couple months,"
39:15;39:18;"it became fairly enormous."
39:18;39:20;"Well, let's check it out."
39:20;39:21;"Who's it by?"
39:21;39:23;"Shaboosie."
39:23;39:24;"Spell that for me."
39:24;39:28;"S-H-A-B-O-O-Z-E-Y."
39:28;39:29;"Okay."
39:29;39:31;"It's called a bar song, tipsy,"
39:31;39:33;"'cause it's kind of based on that old rap song."
39:33;39:35;"Everybody in the club getting tipsy."
39:35;39:37;"And speaking of Oasis, we have been--"
39:37;39:39;"this is very Wonderwall."
39:39;39:41;"I think it's hitting a very similar chord."

40:54;40:55;"Oh."
40:55;40:57;"When we were going to Vampire Weekend"
40:57;40:58;"at the Hollywood Bowl."
40:58;41:00;"That might have been it."
41:00;41:02;"And my family was on a mission"
41:02;41:05;"to find a country song that you did like."
41:05;41:06;"Right."
41:06;41:07;"This was a fun night because"
41:07;41:09;"my wife was working that night,"
41:09;41:10;"so she couldn't go."
41:10;41:13;"So I rolled with Nick and his wife"
41:13;41:15;"and his 12-year-old son, Max."
41:15;41:18;"We were a four-top in the--"
41:18;41:20;"at Taylor Steakhouse in La Quinahada,"
41:20;41:24;"and then we were sitting in a box together."
41:24;41:26;"And there was a nice half-hour drive"
41:26;41:28;"from the restaurant to the venue."
41:28;41:31;"And I think we probably played this for you,"
41:31;41:33;"and you probably were fairly responsive,"
41:33;41:36;"but I know that we just couldn't get you"
41:36;41:38;"over the hump of Zach Ryan."
41:38;41:40;"But then when we did play our other--"
41:40;41:42;"'cause Ezra had said, you know,"
41:42;41:44;"it doesn't have to be from this summer,"
41:44;41:46;"but a song you're playing a lot."
41:46;41:49;"And we've been playing this Joe Diffie song a lot."
41:49;41:52;"You know, John Deere Green."
41:52;41:53;"Oh, right."
41:53;41:54;"And when we did that for you,"
41:54;41:57;"that was, I think, the most you perked up."
41:57;41:59;"That's funny."
41:59;42:02;"Trying to get Jake into modern country."
42:02;42:03;"And this is not even modern."
42:03;42:05;"I mean, Joe Diffie is a, you know,"
42:05;42:08;"sort of a, I think, '90s artist."
42:08;42:10;"I mean, play John Deere Green."
42:10;42:12;"Let's stay on tipsy for a while."
42:12;42:13;"Let's stay on tipsy."
42:13;42:15;"This is a big modern song."
42:15;42:18;"Jake, I know--we all know"
42:18;42:22;"you're a classic Gen X guy with taste--"
42:22;42:24;"a tasteful Gen Xer."
42:24;42:27;"So any tasteful Gen Xer is gonna love"
42:27;42:31;"great country music of the '50s, '60s, and '70s."
42:31;42:34;"But it's time to get on board with modern country"
42:34;42:36;"because this is the summer"
42:36;42:39;"that it became the biggest music in the world."
42:39;42:40;"Did you know that?"
42:40;42:42;"No, I didn't know that."
42:42;42:44;"In my conversations with music industry professionals,"
42:44;42:46;"obviously there's a thing that, like,"
42:46;42:49;"country's been hot in a way."
42:49;42:52;"There's an artist--was it Laney?"
42:52;42:54;"Laney Wilson has a song called ""Country's Cool Again."""
42:54;42:57;"There's just more country in the atmosphere, sure."
42:57;42:58;"Beyonce made a country album."
42:58;43:00;"Like, country comes and goes."
43:00;43:03;"This is one of those moments where country is hot."
43:03;43:05;"But it's at a level we've never seen before."
43:05;43:07;"This is not just, like, one of those eras"
43:07;43:08;"where it's like, yeah, actually,"
43:08;43:10;"there's some more crossover hits from country lately."
43:10;43:13;"This is the first time it's ever gone global,"
43:13;43:18;"and this modern kind of country/pop/trap/whatever hybrid"
43:18;43:20;"has never been bigger than now."
43:20;43:22;"And this is just an example I just had talking"
43:22;43:25;"to one of my friends who works in the music industry."
43:25;43:28;"Now, we all know the name Morgan Wallen."
43:28;43:31;"He's, like, one of the biggest modern country artists, right?"
43:31;43:33;"You know him? You've heard the name, Jake, right, at least?"
43:33;43:35;"For sure."
43:35;43:38;"So very recently, Morgan Wallen"
43:38;43:42;"played to 50,000 people in London."
43:42;43:43;"That's funny."
43:43;43:45;"And apparently there's even just--"
43:45;43:48;"there's talk about, well, Morgan Wallen,"
43:48;43:51;"maybe he could go do some arenas in Asia."
43:51;43:56;"You know, it's just like his music is becoming, like, global pop."
43:56;44:00;"And that's something that a guy who is that much of, like,"
44:00;44:04;"a country dude, I don't know if that's ever happened before."
44:04;44:07;"Well, I don't think country music--I mean, this is--"
44:07;44:10;"yeah, country music is never as popular as it can be here."
44:10;44:13;"It's never been considered to travel well."
44:13;44:16;"Well, certainly, yeah, if you think about the stars of the past,"
44:16;44:20;"like, Waylon Jennings wasn't playing to 50,000 people in London."
44:20;44:22;"Was Garth Brooks in the '90s?"
44:22;44:24;"You know, there may have been these certain--"
44:24;44:25;"Shania?"
44:25;44:26;"Oh, well, Shania, definitely."
44:26;44:27;"Yeah, Shania, sure."
44:27;44:30;"Shania was a global pop star for sure."
44:30;44:34;"And then there's always been places where country is appreciated."
44:34;44:38;"They play country music on the radio in the Caribbean."
44:38;44:41;"You know, there's an African country scene."
44:41;44:44;"See, there's--and Australia has a country scene."
44:44;44:47;"So it's not like it's been totally U.S. only,"
44:47;44:50;"but there's something about a dude like Morgan Wallen"
44:50;44:54;"becoming a global pop star that, I don't know, to me is notable"
44:54;44:55;"because he's not--"
44:55;44:58;"It's like Kenny Chesney, who is, let's say, an equivalent,"
44:58;45:01;"and he's huge in whatever, early 2000s."
45:01;45:05;"He's playing hundreds of--he's just not going to go and play"
45:05;45:07;"internationally the same way."
45:07;45:09;"It's just, I think, as a genre, it just--"
45:09;45:11;"Why is Kenny Chesney the equivalent?"
45:11;45:14;"I think Garth Brooks or Shania Twain's the equivalent."
45:14;45:18;"Garth Brooks is like more clean-cut or something."
45:18;45:22;"Morgan Wallen is more--yeah, it's more of that Kenny Chesney energy"
45:22;45:25;"of being like a Southern party boy."
45:25;45:27;"Lake culture."
45:27;45:30;"It's very lake culture."
45:30;45:32;"There's just something happening."
45:32;45:34;"And again, you know, of course you see in America,"
45:34;45:40;"you kind of see how stagecoach feels like a big cultural moment for sure."
45:40;45:42;"But I'm just saying it's even one step beyond that"
45:42;45:45;"in terms of some of these artists being global."
45:45;45:48;"And I will say that spending some of this summer in Europe,"
45:48;45:52;"I heard this song, ""Shaboozie,"" on the radio in Italy,"
45:52;45:53;"stuff like that."
45:53;45:56;"And I mean, this music is pop music, so it's not crazy,"
45:56;45:58;"but it's still notable."
45:58;46:03;"This is like a big moment for the modern country-pop hybrids."
46:03;46:06;"I just think of the '90s or early 2000s."
46:06;46:09;"It was like, ""I listen to everything except country."""
46:09;46:10;"Except country."
46:10;46:13;"Now it's, ""I don't listen to anything except country."""
46:13;46:14;"Yeah."
46:14;46:15;"No, and I mean, to go one step further,"
46:15;46:17;"there was even a type of person back then"
46:17;46:20;"who used to say, ""I listen to everything except for rap and country."""

47:12;47:13;"Right."
47:13;47:15;"I listen to everything except for music"

52:42;52:47;"You know, even, like, some kind of random '80s stuff, like, ah, I--"

53:05;53:07;"You got to watch--"
53:07;53:11;"I saw the trailer for the doc, and it reminded me a little bit of the Kenny G one,"
53:11;53:15;"where another guy that was, like, famously, hugely popular,"
53:15;53:18;"but also hated for his sort of, like--"
53:18;53:22;"his scene as sort of degrading the aesthetics of the culture or whatever."
53:22;53:26;"And, like, Kenny G was on that doc being like, ""I know it's funny."
53:26;53:29;"It's--I'm--I've--"" You know, he had, like, a shtick going"
53:29;53:33;"about, like, how, ""Yeah, it's funny. Everyone hates me. I'm popular."""
53:33;53:36;"And I feel like Nickelback had a similar--"
53:36;53:38;"in the little trailer I saw."
53:38;53:40;"Nickelback gets a little more emotional."
53:40;53:45;"Kenny G seems like he's this incredibly smart dude,"
53:45;53:48;"so it seems like he's like, ""All right, they hate me."

54:02;54:06;"there's some parts where they're talking about, like, their kids being bullied at school."
54:06;54:08;"That part's sad."
54:08;54:11;"Oh, because their dads were in Nickelback?"
54:11;54:14;"Yeah, Nickelback just became such a punchline."
54:14;54:19;"And also, you know, they're from this, like, really small town, too, so it's--"
54:19;54:24;"I can also understand that--why there'd be some dissonance where--"
54:24;54:29;"because they became a symbol for a type of person,"

54:34;54:38;"with no soul, whatever, and, like, oh, this is the kind of junk"

54:46;54:49;"You know, this is just, like, absolute slop"
54:49;54:51;"that they force us to listen to on the radio."
54:51;54:56;"You can imagine why, for a band that started in, like, a town--"
54:56;55:02;"a 3,000-population town in rural Canada"
55:02;55:04;"that they're--who tore their asses off"

55:19;55:21;"Yeah, we don't have connections."
55:21;55:22;"Right."
55:22;55:25;"And I gotta tell you, being there,"
55:25;55:26;"it is so emotional."
55:26;55:29;"I mean, the music--I know--"
55:29;55:31;"I have no experience with them growing up"
55:31;55:33;"other than radio, right?"
55:33;55:34;"I feel the same way you do."

56:18;56:21;"very late-period Def Leppard or something."
56:21;56:23;"Oh, there's definitely some of that."
56:23;56:24;"Yeah, there's, like--"
56:24;56:26;"To me, there's, like, a continuity of, like--"
56:26;56:28;"They both have songs called ""Photograph."""
56:28;56:31;"Exactly, and, like, the juiced-up aesthetics"
56:31;56:36;"of, like, hysteria-era Def Leppard."
56:36;56:38;"And I--yeah, I just--"
56:38;56:41;"Like, to me, there's some sort of connection between that."
56:41;56:43;"Just juiced-up aesthetics."
56:43;56:47;"I'm trying to find it, but I know that recently"
56:47;56:50;"Nickelback covered Oasis at, like, some giant,"
56:50;56:54;"you know, O2 arena show."
56:54;56:58;"So they clearly like them."
56:58;57:01;"I mean, I'll tell you, Nickelback loves Noel Gallagher."
57:01;57:03;"Okay, maybe Noel never went on them."
57:03;57:05;"He's like, ""Maybe they're too big,"""

57:53;57:54;"Yeah, I think also--"
57:54;57:56;"That's such a tight name."
57:56;57:59;"I think some of it too is just like the way--"
57:59;58:00;"I can't explain it."
58:00;58:02;"There's something about the way that Chad looks."
58:02;58:03;"I think just like--"
58:03;58:04;"It also--"
58:04;58:05;"Yeah."

58:19;58:23;"Well, the hair was a huge swing."
58:23;58:25;"No, but he looks like a rock star"

01:06:01;01:06:10;"Well, that's what I'm kind of saying though."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"It's like, it's very middle."
01:06:12;01:06:16;"It's taking aesthetics that were once kind of extreme"

01:06:30;01:06:39;"Yeah, you know, whatever."

01:06:40;01:06:42;"I mean, I love rock music, but you know,"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"at a certain point, every--"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Whatever rock music."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"Every band is interesting, I think,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"when they've had a long enough career"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"and you want to be like, how did they start?"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"What are the dynamics?"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"And there's stuff that even I related to a little bit"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"in the film, which is, I don't think Vampire was ever hated"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"on the level of a Nickelback,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"but even so, I think everybody,"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"whatever amount of criticism you get,"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"you eventually get to a point where you're kind of like,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"man, we're just doing our thing."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"And there's something that Chad says towards the end,"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"because, you know, of course the narrative is"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"they work their asses off, they get huge,"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"and then it kind of curdles"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"because they become this punchline for a while,"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"even at their greatest success."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"And then, you know, it ends on a happy note"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"where we're like, you know what, man?"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"Most people actually don't hate on Nickelback."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"And, you know, increasingly you got younger artists"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"paying respect and people, you know, shouting them out."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"And Chad says something about like,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"because he clearly was more wounded than the other guys"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"by some of the criticism."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"And he says, you know, I'm out there."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"I'm like the face of the band."
01:07:48;01:07:51;"You know, people are like, I'm walking down"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"through downtown Vancouver, people pull up in their car"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"and say, your band sucks."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"And I guess Nickelback may have experienced that"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"more than any other band."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"And he says, objectively, we're the most hated on band"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"in the world."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"And I think he's right."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- For sure."
01:08:05;01:08:09;"- But when you get to the kind of more happy ending"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"and he's talking about it, he's like, you know what?"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Now I let that stuff roll off my back."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"And this is the part that I related to."
01:08:14;01:08:17;"And I think maybe all artists might relate to"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"as they get older."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"He said, you know what?"
01:08:20;01:08:25;"These days we go out and play Nickelback music"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"to Nickelback fans."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"And we're not out there presenting our music"
01:08:29;01:08:33;"to the whole world and trying to get people"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"to not want to like us to like us."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"He said, that feels like a form of torture"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"for us and the audience when we're out there."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"And there is something to it where like, you know,"
01:08:43;01:08:48;"when you're younger or you're like a band in the spotlight,"
01:08:48;01:08:52;"you're kind of, there is this feeling as if everybody's like,"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"oh, what's this new thing?"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"I'm supposed to care about it."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"And either they're going to say, oh, and I do, it's cool."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"Or they're going to be like, oh, why do you think"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"I would like this?"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"This sucks."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Whereas there's something nice about being older and kind"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"of like, and that's the thing that maybe I connected"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"to the most when he said like, you know what, man,"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"we're out there playing Nickelback music"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"to Nickelback fans."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"I'm like, that's where every artist should hope to get to,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"unless you're a complete psychopath and you need like,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"you need everybody to care about you."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"You know, that's what everybody should want."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"We're, you know, I'm 40."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Like we're out there playing Vampire Weekend music"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"to Vampire Weekend fans."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"And when you've been through enough and you've, you know,"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"you've seen it, seen so many sides of the music industry,"
01:09:27;01:09:31;"if you can reach it to like middle age and you're playing"
01:09:31;01:09:34;"your music to people who care about it, like,"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"and you can just be, enjoy that and be grateful for it."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"That's as good as it gets."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"And I was like, all right, Chad, like, hell yeah."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"I'm glad you're there."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"- Yeah. That makes a lot of sense."
01:09:44;01:09:49;"I mean, yeah, it's really a story of artistic perseverance."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- Right."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"- Sticking with it."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"And that's interesting."
01:09:52;01:09:55;"I didn't, it makes sense to me that you would relate"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"to what Chad was saying."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"Cause yeah, when the, when your first album came out"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"in the, not in a mainstream cultural sense,"
01:10:03;01:10:06;"but in a, in the indie rock world,"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"Vampire Weekend was hated on hard."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"- We were the Nickelback of '08."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"- Absolutely."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"And I was like, everyone needs to calm down."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"- Yeah. I mean, I guess the difference is that like"
01:10:18;01:10:23;"our subsequent albums were better, we probably won,"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"I don't know if we won more people over than,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"like Nickelback like tripled down."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Like, so they."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"- 2013."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"- You guys grew."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"- The readers of Rolling Stone named Nickelback"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"the second worst band of the 90s time period."
01:10:37;01:10:44;"And even the idea of having that as, as a pole is brutal."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"- Yeah."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- 90s? I didn't, okay."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I thought Nickelback was 2000s, but."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"- I mean, definitely they were thriving in the 2000s."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"- Yeah."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"- No, Nickelback got it hard, but yeah,"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"they seem like they're, you know,"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"it seems like a nicer organization."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"They, they care about each other."
01:11:04;01:11:07;"- By the way, as the pendulum swings,"
01:11:07;01:11:11;"that's 10 years ago and now Creed and Nickelback,"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"I think they're kind of."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"- Having a moment."
01:11:13;01:11:17;"- Semi ironic or not, it's having a genuine."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"I think people are."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"- Creed is too?"
01:11:20;01:11:23;"- Oh, Creed's having a huge moment."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"And he's, they've been opening it with,"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"he brought that, I mean, yeah, everybody loves Creed."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"- Scott's having thrown out pitches."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Okay, they're back."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- Actually, that is true."
01:11:33;01:11:36;"When I was in Minnesota, I went into a Walmart and I did,"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"I think I sent you guys a photo of the new vinyl reissues,"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"Shrunk Raft."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"- Human clay."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"- No, it was a Creed's greatest hits."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"- Oh, greatest hits."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"- Newly pressed 180 gram vinyl in the Walmart"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"in like suburban Minnesota."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"And I was like, damn,"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"always mystified by the vinyl selections."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Oh, you know, it was a Target."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"It wasn't a Walmart."
01:11:57;01:12:00;"I'm always mystified by like corporate shame,"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"vinyl curation."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"(laughing)"
01:12:05;01:12:06;"- I mean."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"- Who's their vinyl buyer?"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- Yeah."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"- I was like greatest hits."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"They have like two hits."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"They had,"
01:12:13;01:12:17;"♪ Let's go there, let's make a mistake. ♪"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"And then maybe there was one other one."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"- So you bought it and you're like."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"- Oh yeah, I met."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Yeah, guys."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"- Greatest hits, I only know two."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"I'm going to buy this, get it on the stereo."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"- Huge TC, huge TC news."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"- Yeah."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- Scott Stapp will play Frank Sinatra"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"in the Ronald Reagan biopic."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"(laughing)"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"- That rules."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"- Who's playing Ronald Reagan?"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"- I'm pretty sure it's Dennis Quaid."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Let me see."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I have seen this trailer."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"- Is this a loving, loving portrait?"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"- It's been made."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"- It's been shot."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"- Yes, I've seen, yeah."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"- So is it like."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- Yeah, Dennis Quaid plays Reagan."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"- Is it like 60s and 70s era Reagan?"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Like when he's like."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- I think it's, I know that."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- The actor turning into the governor."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"- Is a character in it."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"So it's like, has to be like,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"I guess like free man, free."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"- Interesting."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"- I'm sure it's like one of these ones"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"that just like."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"- Chad Kroger's playing John Wayne."
01:13:10;01:13:11;"I could see that."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"- That'd be sick."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"But I like the idea of him singing."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"That's up singing Frank Sinatra."
01:13:16;01:13:19;"- Yeah, but yeah, Creed's greatest hits on vinyl"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"is fascinating."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"I mean, I know vinyl is huge"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"and I can picture two distinct demographics."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"Like, you know, when I see the news,"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"like Taylor Swift broke some vinyl,"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"some vinyl sales record."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"I'm like, okay, I can see how her fan base,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"which includes people of all ages,"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"but you know, I guess what I'm saying is"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"when I hear about modern pop stars"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"selling a lot of vinyl,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"I can picture their younger fans"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"who are like already, you know,"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"buying sweatshirts and t-shirts"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"and they want to own the vinyl."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"So I can picture that kind of young pop fan."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"And then of course, I'm very familiar"
01:13:59;01:14:03;"with the kind of more like aging hipster crowd"
01:14:03;01:14:08;"who might want to buy vinyl from an indie band"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"that they love or buy like classic stuff"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"or esoteric stuff to have like a cool vinyl collection."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"You know, who might have been to people's houses"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"who are, you know, in their forties or fifties"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"and you look through their vinyl collection,"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"what have they bought that's new?"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"They might buy some cool soul jazz compilation"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"or, you know, something vibey to put on in the house."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"So I'm familiar with both those groups,"
01:14:31;01:14:35;"members of the vinyl buying public."
01:14:35;01:14:38;"The Creed's greatest hits on vinyl crowd"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"is hard for me to picture."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Tell me about this, how you feel,"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"or how you feel about this as a,"
01:14:44;01:14:48;"even a way to put greatest hits together."
01:14:48;01:14:53;"So there's four songs from my own prison."
01:14:53;01:14:57;"There's four songs from Human Clay"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"and six songs from Weathered."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"That's it."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"I mean, even just..."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"So there's three Creed albums?"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Yeah, I had just something about putting that together."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"Are there only three Creed albums?"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Three on greatest hits."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Three that had any greatest hits."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Well, maybe this is greatest hits volume one."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"Well, I'll tell you something, Nick."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"That's the exact formula that created"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"one of the best selling albums of all time, which is..."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Is that the Eagles?"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"The Eagles greatest hits volume one,"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"because back in the day,"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"you would sometimes do a greatest hits"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"as a way to kind of repackage"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"what an artist had accomplished on their last few albums"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"and it would actually make them bigger."
01:15:33;01:15:34;"And I guess, you know,"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"that's hard to picture in the streaming era"
01:15:36;01:15:39;"because you picture whatever, it's like 1974."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"The Eagles are this kind of like bubbling band."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"It made a lot of sense for their label to be like,"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"let's take the best songs off your first few albums,"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"package it as your greatest hits"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"and create this like banger album."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"And then that goes on to become"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"one of the best selling records of all time."
01:15:54;01:15:58;"Well, I think those songs were hits."
01:15:58;01:16:02;"Like, ""Lyin' Eyes"" was like a Grammy award winning."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Somebody might say,"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"all right, you have a few hits off three albums,"
01:16:05;01:16:09;"like that doesn't necessitate a compilation."
01:16:09;01:16:13;"But by putting the best of those three albums together,"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"it took it to the limit."

01:17:36;01:17:38;"Welcome to the show."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Hey, what's up guys?"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"I'm having some real tech difficulties here."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"We can hear you okay."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"Okay, good. Thanks."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"How are you guys doing?"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Can you recap the whole show for me so far?"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"We've been talking your countrymen Nickelback."
01:17:52;01:17:57;"How about we want to give us the quick Canadian perspective on Nickelback."
01:17:57;01:18:02;"The Canadians, I feel like the Canadians feel the same way"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"the general public does about them."
01:18:04;01:18:10;"I know that, you know, growing up in their heyday,"
01:18:10;01:18:14;"we were exposed to them quite a bit due to Canada's"
01:18:14;01:18:18;"much discussed CanCon Canadian content rules."
01:18:18;01:18:22;"So we saw them on television quite a bit."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"What can I say?"
01:18:24;01:18:28;"I had a journalist friend interview them once"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"when they were really breaking through"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"and they had done a McDonald's partnership."
01:18:32;01:18:35;"And she said, how does it feel to be working for McDonald's"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"in like a cheeky way?"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"And they were like, what do you say?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Chad Kroger was like, what are you talking about?"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"We don't work for McDonald's."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"What are you talking about? What are you talking about?"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"And they got really mad and they had to like apologize"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"and take lunch after the fact."
01:18:47;01:18:53;"So I guess Chad is a sensitive fellow when it comes to the journalism."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"That might have been in the era when they were getting hated on all the time."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"I guess for you, did you ever feel a sense of Canadian pride"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"or when people were beating up on Nickelback"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"and you were living down in the States,"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"did you ever feel a little bit like, you know, hold up, hold up."
01:19:06;01:19:10;"Like we're allowed to make fun of them, but those are my brothers."
01:19:10;01:19:15;"Or as an urbane Montrealer, when you hear about some farm boys"
01:19:15;01:19:20;"from Hannah, Alberta, Saskatchewan, I don't know."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"When you hear about some guys from a small town in Western Canada,"
01:19:23;01:19:28;"are you like, that has nothing to do with me and my Canada?"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"I think it's more the latter."
01:19:30;01:19:34;"You know, how do I put it?"
01:19:34;01:19:41;"Western Canada, or at least that's sort of like Prairie Plains middle area,"
01:19:41;01:19:46;"is kind of regarded in Canada the way that coastal elites"
01:19:46;01:19:50;"might view the American Bible Belt in some ways."
01:19:50;01:19:55;"And so there isn't really like a unified national pride over the boys."
01:19:55;01:19:59;"I will say that one song, I don't know if you talked about it earlier,"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"but ""Never made it as a wise man."""
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Oh yeah, of course, we listened to it."
01:20:04;01:20:11;"Okay. I mean, personally, you know, all cultural and sort of critical baggage aside,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"that song is catchy as hell."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Yeah, well written."
01:20:15;01:20:19;"Did you appreciate the song when you were talking about it?"
01:20:19;01:20:25;"Yeah, I mean, as you can imagine, I was defending Chad's"
01:20:25;01:20:29;"preternatural understanding of pop architecture."
01:20:29;01:20:33;"And everybody admitted like, yeah, you know, there's like something to it."
01:20:33;01:20:36;"When Chad was married to Avril Lavigne,"
01:20:36;01:20:42;"did that connection amp up the Canadian pride"
01:20:42;01:20:45;"when two of the greats came together?"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"Amp up the Canadian pride?"
01:20:47;01:20:51;"No, I think it was seen as a very excessive partnership."
01:20:51;01:20:55;"Like they were both kind of very accomplished at the time."
01:20:55;01:20:58;"And I think it was a little bit like, I don't know,"
01:20:58;01:21:03;"maybe it's the closest thing Canada had to like a Kim Kanye type of union."
01:21:03;01:21:07;"Both of them mega successful hit makers in their own right coming together."
01:21:07;01:21:12;"I think it was a little, maybe a little much for Canadian tastes."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"And it was, I don't know how long they were together."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"It was kind of short lived, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"Yeah, a few years. They're still friends."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"Yeah."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"I miss it. Are they from Alberta?"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"Yeah. Where's Hannah?"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"I think that is Alberta."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Let me double check."
01:21:29;01:21:32;"Hannah, Alberta sounds right."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Canadian Prairie."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Yeah, it's the plains."
01:21:35;01:21:38;"It's the flatlands of Canada."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Yeah, it is Alberta."
01:21:39;01:21:45;"So they would have come up playing the clubs of Calgary."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"The Stampede."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"They probably, they probably did the Stampede."
01:21:48;01:21:51;"Maybe, maybe throw up the medicine hat, play the gig."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Moose Jaw."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Have you seen the Moose Jaw?"
01:21:55;01:21:59;"They were, they were torn all over Canada."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"I mean, that's where like, is that Neil Young from?"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"I know he's from the Prairie."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"I don't know if he's from Alberta."
01:22:04;01:22:08;"He might be from the other province to the east of there."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"But, um."
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Neil Young."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Neil Young is from, um."
01:22:15;01:22:18;"Oh, Winnipeg."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"No."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"Wait, so he was born in Toronto."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"I guess he blew up."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"He was based in Winnipeg."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"I should know this."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Whatever."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"Okay."
01:22:32;01:22:38;"This is how you remind me of what I really am."
01:22:38;01:22:40;"So Ezra, do you have a song of the summer?"
01:22:40;01:22:44;"Well, there's a couple that I've been thinking about."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"I don't know why, certain songs get into my head."
01:22:46;01:22:52;"I mean, I'll start with this because I feel like I talk so little about new music."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"And the truth is, I kind of follow new music."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"I do and I don't."
01:22:57;01:22:58;"Yeah."
01:22:58;01:23:04;"So, I do feel like, especially on this show, we tend to dig into the past."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"We talk a lot about different eras."
01:23:06;01:23:09;"You know, it is time crisis after all."
01:23:09;01:23:13;"But, it's rare that we just kind of talk about new bands."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"And this band's not even that new."
01:23:16;01:23:24;"I've been having a moment of fandom and interest in the band Fontaine's DC."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"You guys know them?"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Heard of them."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"It was kind of fun."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"I'd heard the name."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"They've been releasing records since, I think, 2019."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Irish band."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"Somebody actually put me onto the singer's solo work."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"And I was listening to his solo album and I was like, ""Oh, this is really good."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"Wait, who's this again?"
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Oh, he's in that band."""
01:23:42;01:23:44;"So anyway, I was checking out the guy's solo album."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"And I was like, ""Oh, I want to check this band out more."""
01:23:46;01:23:48;"So, I started to listen to them."
01:23:48;01:23:53;"And then, right like a month after that, they launched their new album,"
01:23:53;01:23:56;"which is coming out in August."
01:23:56;01:23:58;"So, they put out the first single."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"And this is a song called Starburster."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"And there was something-- so, they're not a new band, but whatever."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"They've only been releasing records for five years."
01:24:06;01:24:10;"They're kind of entering phase two, I guess, of their career."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"And there's a lot of things that I like about this."
01:24:13;01:24:16;"And I love the music video for this song."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"And also, I like that they're kind of changing up their aesthetic."
01:24:20;01:24:24;"You can see from the press pictures that the band is dressing differently."
01:24:24;01:24:29;"To me, that's one of the real hallmarks of sometimes for me"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"when I get interested in an artist is when you can see they're kind of"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"entering a new era and you're like, ""Oh, you can do a lot of different stuff."""
01:24:35;01:24:37;"You had that kind of vibe."
01:24:37;01:24:40;"Now, you're changing up the clothes a little bit, changing up the sound."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"And I think that's where this band is now."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"This is kind of a big song for--"
01:24:44;01:24:49;"like, when I've been talking with people about rock music,"
01:24:49;01:24:52;"a lot of people are like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, I like that band. I like that song."""
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Have you guys heard it? It's called Starburster."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"I don't think so."
01:24:59;01:25:04;"To anybody listening, later, go watch the video."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"It's one of the weirdest, most interesting videos"
01:25:07;01:25:11;"I've seen from a rock band in a few years."
01:25:23;01:25:26;"So this is kind of a left turn for this band,"
01:25:26;01:25:30;"but it's made me interested in their whole catalog."
01:26:04;01:26:08;"I love the strong Irish accent and the way this dude sings."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"And actually, Jake, I feel like you might like the second single more,"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"called ""Favorite."""
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Already I like it more."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Yeah, this is tight."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"Is this on their upcoming record, or is this an older--"
01:27:25;01:27:31;"Yeah, so these are the two singles, and the album's out next month."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"You get the idea."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"I like that."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"It has a nice feel."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"It's a good band."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Cool."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"So that's something new that I've been liking."
01:28:30;01:28:35;"And then I've also lately just been going back to--"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I mean, this is just an eternal classic,"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"but it's one of these old songs."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"I don't know."
01:28:39;01:28:43;"It pops into my mind sometimes, and it's Poncho and Lefty."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"I'm sure you like this song, Jake."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Of course."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Which version?"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Towns."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Towns version."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"Is this one of the live records?"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"It sounds live to me."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"Yeah, let me see if I can find a--"
01:29:08;01:29:11;"Are you a Towns fan in general, or--"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"There's like a Cuson."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"I've never gone super deep."
01:29:32;01:29:35;"I was just thinking about Towns the other day."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"You know at the end of Lebowski, he does that cover of--"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"Rolling Stones, yeah."
01:29:39;01:29:44;"I just love that, this kind of semi-obscure or majorly obscure"
01:29:44;01:29:49;"kind of Texas songwriter."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"Because that's also a live recording, that definitive Towns version"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"of Dead Flowers."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Oh, really?"
01:29:55;01:29:58;"[singing]"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"Just him covering a Stones song."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"It sounds like something he would have written, kind of."
01:30:03;01:30:06;"But I didn't mean for you to cut off Poncho and Lefty."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"No, but yeah, let me play the--"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"This is the version I know better, actually."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"The studio, yeah."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Yeah."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"It's these opening lyrics."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Maybe because I've been living on the road."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"[singing]"
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Living on the road, my friend"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"What's going to keep you free and clean?"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"Now you wear your skin like iron"
01:30:28;01:30:32;"And your breath's as hard as kerosene"
01:30:32;01:30:35;"You weren't your mama's only boy"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"But her favorite one, it seems"
01:30:38;01:30:45;"She began to cry when you said goodbye"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"And sank into your dreams"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"That's the line that I think about all the time."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"It's so evocative."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favorite one, it seems."
01:30:54;01:30:58;"She cried the day you said goodbye and sank into your dreams."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"It's that, sank into your dreams."
01:31:00;01:31:04;"I've just always thought that was such an interesting turn of phrase."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"And also, so--"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Yeah, actually, I've got to think about it."
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Why is that so evocative?"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"I think there's something, too, about--"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"Obviously, there's so much language, culturally, in songs and movies"
01:31:17;01:31:21;"and inspirational posters about chasing your dreams,"
01:31:21;01:31:25;"fulfilling your dreams, never giving up on your dreams."
01:31:25;01:31:28;"And there's just something so raw and kind of real"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"about sinking into your dreams."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"Where you picture this dude who's like, ""Mom, I've got to leave this small town."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"I want to go down to Mexico. I've got big dreams or something."""
01:31:37;01:31:41;"And rather than think of it as like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, go climb"
01:31:41;01:31:44;"and go up towards your dreams,"" this idea of the opposite,"
01:31:44;01:31:48;"sinking into your dreams, it's like some be careful what you wish for [censored]"
01:31:48;01:31:53;"when you kind of lose touch with the things that keep your life stable"
01:31:53;01:31:56;"or make you who you are and you chase after something different."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"There's the image of sinking into your dreams."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"It's like dark and weird."
01:32:02;01:32:06;"Picture somebody getting too high and just kind of floating off"
01:32:06;01:32:09;"into some weird, numbed-out--"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"-Delusion? -Delusion."
01:32:11;01:32:16;"Yeah, yeah, exactly. Sinking into your dreams is falling into delusion."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"And I mean, also, he's just such a masterful songwriter."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"But just in the first verse, ""Living on the road, my friend,"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"was supposed to keep you free and clean."
01:32:26;01:32:30;"Now you wear your skin like iron and your breath's as hard as kerosene."""
01:32:30;01:32:32;"-Amazing. -So basically it's saying,"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"before we even know anything about who Poncho and Lefty are,"
01:32:35;01:32:42;"it's this person who was chasing freedom, in some sense,"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"going out on the road, chasing your dreams,"
01:32:45;01:32:51;"but instead they've become harder, weirder, and maybe more deluded."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"It just says so much with not a lot of words."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Yeah, and it's interesting that--"
01:32:56;01:33:01;"because this is a story song about these two bandits that go down to Mexico."
01:33:01;01:33:04;"But I like how he could have started the song with,"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"""Poncho was a bandit boy."""
01:33:07;01:33:11;"But he starts with these two verses that are kind of like a tone setter,"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"and you're not even sure who they're about."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"Right. Yeah, that's true. That would be so much more traditional."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"The song's called Poncho and Lefty. Let me tell you about Poncho."
01:33:19;01:33:22;"Right. But it starts with two--"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"Yeah, living on the road, my friend."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Yeah, it's more psychological."
01:33:27;01:33:33;"Now verse two, a little more trash."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"Yeah."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"He dressed his polished steel"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"Wore his gun outside his pants"
01:33:39;01:33:43;"For all the honest world to feel"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"But Poncho met his match, you know"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"On the deserts down in Mexico"
01:33:50;01:33:54;"And nobody heard his dying words"
01:33:54;01:33:59;"Oh, but that's the way it goes"
01:34:02;01:34:06;"And all the federales say"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"They could have had him any day"
01:34:09;01:34:13;"They only let him hang around"
01:34:13;01:34:19;"Out of kindness, I suppose"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Amazing chorus. Yeah."
01:34:21;01:34:25;"And Lefty, he can't sing the blues"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"All night long like he used to"
01:34:28;01:34:32;"The dusty poncho bit down south"
01:34:32;01:34:36;"Ended up in Lefty's mouth"
01:34:36;01:34:39;"A day that laid poor Poncho low"
01:34:39;01:34:43;"Lefty split for Ohio"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Where he got the bread to go"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"The bread. The bread."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"He absconded with the bread. Lefty absconded with the bread."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Yeah, the geography of the song was crazy, too."
01:34:53;01:34:56;"It's like, he was in Cleveland, they're in Mexico."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"What's going on?"
01:34:58;01:35:02;"They could have had him any day"
01:35:02;01:35:06;"They only let him slip away"
01:35:06;01:35:11;"So Poncho got killed in Mexico"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"and then Lefty went back to Cleveland."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"Yeah. I think, well, we'll listen to the rest of it,"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"but as we listen to the song right now,"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"I'm also getting big, like, a little bit,"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"I mean, maybe I just have a very limited,"
01:35:24;01:35:27;"as a silverback millennial, I have very limited references,"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"a little bit of Sopranos energy,"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"a little bit of the Irishman,"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"just in terms of being like,"
01:35:33;01:35:38;"this song clearly takes place after the golden age of cowboys"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"and the wild west."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"This song clearly is about,"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"or at least takes place in the era"
01:35:45;01:35:48;"of Codes of the Road breaking down."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"Like, this is not about a dude who had these dreams"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"to go out west and he was like a gunslinger."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"It's not 19th century."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"No, no, this is like the tail end of it."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"A la Tony Soprano, Lefty did not get in on the ground floor."
01:36:02;01:36:05;"And so he sinks into his dreams."
01:36:05;01:36:08;"He links up with perhaps an honorable guy, Poncho."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"Poncho wore his gun outside his pants"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"for all the honest world to fear."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Like, he was an honest dude."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"He's old school, plays by the code,"
01:36:17;01:36:20;"I got my gun out, I'm not trying to hide anything from you."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"He's an honest dude, Lefty gets mixed up with him."
01:36:22;01:36:26;"But you already have this world of lies and betrayals."
01:36:26;01:36:30;"Seemingly, Lefty got mixed up in something"
01:36:30;01:36:34;"and probably turned Poncho in or did wrong by him."
01:36:34;01:36:38;"Like, maybe Lefty got stuck in a situation where he's like,"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"yeah, nobody's quite sure how Lefty found the bread"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"to get back to Ohio."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"That implies that he should have stayed there"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"and died with his boy."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"So we get the impression that Lefty is maybe a little crooked"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"or he was just in over his head."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"Maybe somebody was like, yo, listen, dude,"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"we're gonna kill you unless you tell us where Poncho is."
01:36:57;01:37:00;"So Lefty, there might be something dishonest about Lefty."
01:37:00;01:37:04;"And then also the Federales, as we hear in the chorus,"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"are these kind of blowhards who are full of (beep)."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Oh yeah, and all these Federales,"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"yeah, they say they almost had 'em any day."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"Oh, I guess they just let 'em get away"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"'cause they're just nice guys, right?"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Everybody's kind of full of (beep)."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"It reminds me of like, I mean,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"maybe just 'cause we're talking about Lebowski,"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"but it makes me think of a Coen Brothers movie,"
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Fargo or something."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Yeah."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"It's these hapless idiots."
01:37:28;01:37:31;"There's a comedy to this that's very Coen."
01:37:31;01:37:35;"This might even be set in the '60s or something."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Right, it's like guys with delusions."
01:37:37;01:37:41;"It's literally a dude who grew up on cowboy movies"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"from Ohio who was like, you know,"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"one day that's gonna be me."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"He meets this dude, Poncho,"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"and within two weeks, everything goes to (beep)."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Yeah."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"Poncho's dead, Lebowski's like,"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"""Oh, (beep) man, oh, (beep)."""
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Yeah."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"Sells him out."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"To quote Hans Gruber,"
01:37:58;01:38:01;"""Just another American brought the orphan"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"""of a bankrupt culture."""
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Yeah, totally."

01:43:17;01:43:19;"Yeah, Jake, have you been having a brat summer?"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Not yet."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Okay."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"Do you even know what that means?"
01:43:23;01:43:26;"Have you been having a brat summer?"
01:43:26;01:43:31;"Well, I wouldn't have known, but I heard Seinfeld say Charlie XCX."
01:43:31;01:43:36;"And it sort of, there was like a dim connection that my mind just made."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Oh, has that hurt your record?"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"But I have been having a brat summer."
01:43:39;01:43:44;"That's actually in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and I had pretty much a daily brat."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"A daily brat in the Midwest."
01:43:46;01:43:54;"You know, it's funny, I used to have a thing with my son called Brat Night."
01:43:54;01:44:00;"And it was like, when we were living in Japan, and I would like sometimes take him out for dinner."
01:44:00;01:44:05;"We lived near a New York style pizzeria in Tokyo."
01:44:05;01:44:16;"And it was kind of like, so they kind of made it, but it was like slick, but it kind of looked like a little bit like just like a, you know, by the slice pizza joint in New York."
01:44:16;01:44:21;"But it was kind of slick and you could, you know, like the people behind the counter wearing like Yankees hats."
01:44:21;01:44:28;"But, you know, it was different kinds of pizza and you could also get like fries and stuff and maybe like chicken wings."
01:44:28;01:44:36;"So, you know, it's kind of like, all right, we're gonna go get some, I probably said something about like, all right, it's not gonna be the healthiest dinner, but like, we're gonna go do like pizza night."
01:44:36;01:44:41;"And somehow he was, maybe he was three at the time."
01:44:41;01:44:46;"He had some, he just started calling the nights when we go there, Brat Night."
01:44:46;01:44:52;"You know, like in the way, like a little kid, he like, he probably, I probably gave some energy like, okay, this is a special occasion."
01:44:52;01:44:56;"We're gonna eat just a bunch of pizza and wings, not, you know, no vegetables."
01:44:56;01:45:07;"And somehow like, you know, little kids understanding of the word brat, like not, not totally dialed in was, but I understand the connection, you know, like it makes sense and yet it doesn't."
01:45:07;01:45:11;"So anyway, that became known as, as Brat Night."
01:45:11;01:45:15;"He's like, I'm a spoiled brat. I'm eating pizza and ice cream."
01:45:15;01:45:19;"Exactly. Like he, I don't even know what his point of reference would be."
01:45:19;01:45:24;"Probably like Dudley Dursley in the first Harry Potter movie."
01:45:24;01:45:28;"So yeah, maybe he was just like, well, brat kind of just does whatever they want."
01:45:28;01:45:34;"So when you just eat like pizza and wings and like finish it off with an ice cream sundae, you're being a brat."
01:45:34;01:45:37;"Was this boys only? Was it just the boys?"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"No, sometimes girls would be invited."
01:45:40;01:45:45;"Okay. So I can't really do like a brat pack. Although I guess the brat pack did have girls in them."
01:45:45;01:45:56;"Nevermind. That doesn't really, but brat is, I guess it's all to say that brat is a very evocative word that people of all ages understand the power of brat."
01:45:56;01:46:05;"And as soon as I saw the album cover, by the way, like I was like, all right, there's something very good about this."
01:46:05;01:46:10;"That, that kind of weird green color. I got to look this up. Is this her new album? It's called brat."
01:46:10;01:46:16;"It's called brat. Yeah. It's like this bilious green, uh, kind of like a sickly neon."
01:46:16;01:46:22;"Oh, I've seen people like riffing on that. Yeah. There's a lot of memes around this, but I haven't seen brat."
01:46:22;01:46:30;"I didn't know what even what it was. I feel like there was something on the TC thread that you might've seen some reference."
01:46:30;01:46:42;"There was a, there's a picture. A lot of people sent me that was, um, somebody at her show or something who had a homemade t-shirt that that said only brat was above us."
01:46:42;01:46:46;"It was like a combination of the only God was above us logo and brat. Okay."
01:46:46;01:46:53;"I'll tell you something else that I thought as soon as I saw this, uh, image was when I saw that color."
01:46:53;01:47:08;"Um, and this is before, I think before Steve Albini died, rest in peace to me, that color green connotes the, the album songs about by big black, you know, Steve Albini has been in the eighties."
01:47:08;01:47:14;"Yeah. And he has this one, they're going to have to bleep it out, but his band big black had an album called songs about."
01:47:14;01:47:23;"And it's kind of like an anime type, uh, illustration of like a woman's face with sweat pouring down it."
01:47:23;01:47:30;"And, and it's got this, like the same, a very similar kind of like slightly fluorescent green color."
01:47:30;01:47:34;"I don't know if that was on the mood board either way. Great."
01:47:34;01:47:45;"Or maybe the third Weezer album, lime green, like tennis ball color. Yeah. Green."
01:47:45;01:47:51;"Well, only, only cause I got a hard out in 90 seconds, making probably the worst Seinfeld 2000 appearance on this show."
01:47:51;01:47:55;"Okay. Well, what's, what's the jam. What's the best song on the break?"
01:47:55;01:48:02;"Yeah. If you can, uh, if you can humor me by playing 360, um, and if you can keep it going, yeah."
01:48:02;01:48:09;"Yeah. Track, I think it's track one. Yeah. And then if you want to keep it going until Jake, like can't tolerate any more of this."
01:48:09;01:48:22;"I'm not, I'm not mad at this. Okay. We listened to like a half hour of Nickelback, dude."
01:48:22;01:48:29;"I can see this playing and, uh, at the gym when Jake's working out and totally be like, huh?"
01:48:29;01:48:37;"You know what, Ezra, can you tell us the track length? This is two 14. I love that. That is a good, I love that length. Right."
01:48:37;01:48:47;"It leaves you wanting more. Honestly, I could see coming home one day and, and Hannah and Lizzie hanging out in the kitchen with this blasting."
01:48:47;01:48:59;"I could absolutely see that. No, this is cool. I like six, six, six with the princess tree. It was truly on time crisis. Yes. Oh yeah."
01:48:59;01:49:08;"Christmas episode. I think there was a Christmas episode. Oh wow. I forgot about that. I didn't even know if he was, I think he had a special dessert or something."
01:49:08;01:49:14;"She brought something. It was, it was more exciting than a normal guest. I remember."
01:49:14;01:49:24;"Yeah. Ezra, you've been, uh, you've been in one of her music videos. Have you not? Yeah, I was, I was, I appeared in one of her music videos that have a lot of cameos of various boys."
01:49:24;01:49:35;"Romeo. When was that? Uh, a while ago, six, seven years ago. All right. I love you guys. Happy Brad."
01:49:35;01:49:50;"Love you. Love you Seinfeld. Peace out, bro. Seinfeld, our resident pop expert. That was nice. That's a good call too. Cause Brad is definitely like one of the albums of the summer."
01:49:50;01:49:59;"There's a lot to like there. I have another song that we could go out on and maybe talk about another time. Sure. It's um, it's a nice summary title."
01:49:59;01:50:08;"Another sunny day by Bell and Sebastian. This one's been on heavy rotation on my iPhone."
01:50:08;01:50:12;"And we've talked a bit about the fact that you're a late in life Bell and Sebastian convert."
01:50:12;01:50:22;"I've been in a bell kick the last month or a few months. And this is one, right? This is a banger. This was off their 2006 album."
01:50:22;01:50:41;"I mean, I got to admit though, I'm, I'm very familiar with the first four Bell and Sebastian albums by 2006. I, I certainly was not anti, I just like, you know, sometimes you're like so deep in the band in a certain era."
01:50:41;01:50:51;"And then like, you kind of stop keeping, you're just like onto something else and you don't keep up. So no, I don't know this album that well. Let's listen. Another sunny day off the life pursuit 2006."
01:50:51;01:51:17;"This actually came out the month Vampire Weekend started. Oh, wow. So I was, I was, I was turning away from modern indie to find the correct set of influences to begin our journey. That makes sense."
01:51:17;01:51:23;"I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous boulder."
01:51:23;01:51:29;"I always respected that about you guys. You really had like a specific set of yeses and nos."
01:51:29;01:51:32;"Yeah, we had, yeah, we had to. You set parameters to focus."
01:51:32;01:51:49;"I think that's what any young artist has to do. You have to be like, you have to look around at like the, the indie bands who are like just before you of like the last 10 years. And you have to be like, all due respect, we got to do something a little different."
01:51:49;01:51:53;"Yep."
01:51:53;01:52:01;"Whereas, I don't know, maybe we'll have our Bell and Sebastian era in the future."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Yeah, this sounds great."
01:52:03;01:52:15;"I love this song. This is just about a romance basically. And it's just like, it's I mean the music is beautiful. The singing is incredible. I love the melodies."
01:52:15;01:52:18;"Yeah, I love his voice."
01:52:18;01:52:23;"And I love this like very English imagery."

01:52:40;01:53:03;"Yeah, he's like playing soccer. This woman catches his eye on the sideline."

01:53:10;01:53:13;"Also, the first appearance of winter."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"Oh, wow. Wow. Big M."
01:53:15;01:53:23;"So yeah, kind of canon. And then, you know, I thought that I'd tell you guys that I spotted. It was Christmas. It was Christmas."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Christmas with Charlie and Winter."
01:53:25;01:53:30;"Did I tell you guys that I spotted Winter in the crowd at one of our shows?"
01:53:30;01:53:37;"Yeah, like I was just kind of like in between songs. I was looking around like sometimes I'll like shout out like if I see any cool T-shirts in the crowd."
01:53:37;01:53:41;"And I was kind of like looking at that. I was like, oh, that's a cool shirt. Oh, look at that. That's cool bootleg."
01:53:41;01:53:45;"And then I was like, oh, what up, Winter? But I was like on the mic. So I think he was kind of like, whoa."
01:53:45;01:53:49;"And then everybody turned around and there were like some TC heads in the crowd like, yo, yo, Winter."
01:53:49;01:53:54;"And he's like, oh, yeah, hey, just very honest. You're just in the pit just hanging out."
01:53:54;01:54:00;"I love that."
01:54:00;01:54:08;"I had a painting, a little group show in L.A. this past weekend and I went to the opening early side and then dipped."
01:54:08;01:54:13;"And then I saw on Instagram that Winter had cruised into the opening."

01:54:55;01:55:00;"So, you know, I've been like I said, I've been traveling my family out here on the East Coast."
01:55:00;01:55:05;"I came in for half a day in the big city, Manhattan."
01:55:05;01:55:11;"Because to record Time Crisis in the studio and also work, I got to work."
01:55:11;01:55:18;"I left the family at the beach and said, daddy's taking the bus into the big city."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Real Don Draper."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"Yeah, very, very Don Draper."
01:55:23;01:55:28;"I got on the Metro North to Grand Central and then I huffed it over here."
01:55:28;01:55:34;"And another reason that I want to come into the city is that a friend of mine told me he had a ticket to see Elvis Costello."
01:55:34;01:55:38;"And I thought, you know what? Elvis Costello is like a huge artist in my life."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"Very important to me."
01:55:40;01:55:45;"Like huge influence on Vampire Weekend, like in kind of like high school."
01:55:45;01:55:52;"And there was like a couple year period where that was like my favorite artist going super deep on like the first, at least the first five albums."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"And then beyond that too."
01:55:53;01:55:58;"But like really getting into them, fascinated by his arc, his songwriting."
01:55:58;01:56:03;"And I've never seen him live, so I'm excited to see my first Elvis Costello concert tonight."
01:56:03;01:56:06;"So I was kind of reflecting on Elvis."
01:56:06;01:56:10;"You know, I thought maybe I would do a whole like guide to Elvis Costello."
01:56:10;01:56:15;"But actually, I kind of got stuck just like listening to his first album, My Aim Is True."
01:56:15;01:56:19;"And I know we talked about him when we were talking about Tradwave."
01:56:19;01:56:23;"Which he definitely is Tradwave in many ways."
01:56:23;01:56:28;"But there's something about his first album, My Aim Is True, 1977."
01:56:28;01:56:32;"You know, the year punk, you know, goes wide."
01:56:32;01:56:39;"And it's so kind of like, has punk energy, a deep connection to like rock and roll."
01:56:39;01:56:48;"But I also realized there's like a sound to this record that's so that East Coast rock that we talked about with like J. Giles band and like Bruce and stuff."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"This is track one, Welcome to the Working Week."
01:57:00;01:57:04;"Because he's got that like soul thing that East Coast rock has."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"But actually,"
01:57:18;01:57:23;"It's, I don't know, it's really got an East Coast vibe to me."
01:57:23;01:57:28;"This song is, I love this song, Miracle Man."
01:57:28;01:57:31;"There's like more of a Bruce Springsteen connection than I think I remember."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"I could totally hear Bruce singing this."
01:57:57;01:58:00;"Because you can hear like 50s and 60s like all over it."
01:58:00;01:58:01;"For sure."
01:58:04;01:58:06;"More of a Van Morrison's."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"Well, there's that Van Morrison soulfulness."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"I remember, yeah."
01:58:09;01:58:12;"But then with that, that late 70s punkiness."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"This also just reminds me of like early SNL."
01:58:20;01:58:23;"I mean, I'm sure he was on SNL in this era."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"What's his set list like these days?"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"Have you looked or?"
01:58:29;01:58:33;"Yeah, I mean, he's always dropping classics from what I saw."
01:58:33;01:58:36;"Does he do Allison every show?"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"I think most."
01:58:37;01:58:40;"And then Allison is always just such an interesting song."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"This like young dude."
01:58:44;01:58:46;"I think also he had a different band on this record."
01:58:46;01:58:51;"So it's before the attractions with that kind of Farpisa organ."
01:58:51;01:58:56;"I think the band maybe is, was like Clover that Huey Lewis used to be in."
01:58:56;01:59:01;"So maybe it's the fact that he's an American backup band gives it some different flavor."
01:59:08;01:59:13;"I wonder who's playing that lead because it's such an important part of this song."
01:59:13;01:59:15;"Yeah, it's great playing."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"Yeah."
01:59:45;01:59:48;"John McPhee on guitar."
01:59:48;01:59:49;"American?"
01:59:49;01:59:50;"I don't know."
01:59:54;01:59:56;"Of the Doobie Brothers."
01:59:56;01:59:57;"Oh, there you go."
01:59:57;01:59:59;"That tracks."
01:59:59;02:00:03;"I've just really been having a moment going back to My Name is True."
02:00:03;02:00:04;"That's awesome."
02:00:04;02:00:08;"That's enough for TC, but why don't we go out on Less Than Zero."
02:00:08;02:00:11;"This is always a song I loved off the cello."
02:00:11;02:00:16;"And this is also very East Coast rock to me."
02:00:16;02:00:18;"You know what I mean?"
02:00:18;02:00:19;"Oh, yeah."
02:00:19;02:00:23;"Yo, Jimmy, meet me at the studio, 52nd Street."
02:00:23;02:00:25;"All right, Bobby."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"Let me grab a slice."
02:00:27;02:00:29;"Oh, yeah, grab some slices for the boys."
02:00:29;02:00:30;"All right."
02:00:30;02:00:33;"Two planes."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"Yeah, Stevie's coming in from Jersey."
02:00:35;02:00:40;"All right, we're going to lay down some tracks."
02:00:40;02:00:42;"You guys been checking out that punk rock?"
02:00:42;02:00:47;"Yeah, it's just rock and roll to me."
02:00:47;02:00:50;"I like the energy."
02:00:50;02:00:56;"You're so traditional, man."
02:00:56;02:00:58;"Hey, watch out for the Son of Sam."
02:00:58;02:01:01;"Hey."
02:01:01;02:01:05;"How about them Yankees, huh, Reggie?"
02:01:05;02:01:06;"East Coast, man."
02:01:06;02:01:07;"It's so East Coast."
02:01:07;02:01:08;"I can't explain it."
02:01:08;02:01:10;"Summer of '77, bro."
02:01:10;02:01:13;"Oswald and his sister are doing it again"
02:01:13;02:01:18;"They got the finest home movies that you have ever seen"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"They got a thousand variations"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"Every service with a smile"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"They're gonna take a little break"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"And they'll be back after a while"
02:01:26;02:01:35;"Well, I hear the South America is coming in to style"
02:01:35;02:01:39;"Turn out the TV, no one will suspect"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"Even your mother won't detect it"
02:01:41;02:01:44;"So your father won't know"
02:01:44;02:01:48;"They think that I got no respect"
02:01:48;02:01:52;"But everything means less than zero"
02:01:52;02:01:57;"Hey, hey, hey"
02:01:57;02:02:02;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
