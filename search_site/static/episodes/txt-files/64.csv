00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back once again. On this episode, we'll be joined by Chris Bale to"
00:07;00:15;"explain to us the phenomenon known as Shaggy Sting or Sting Shaggy. We'll also"
00:15;00:23;"read some spicy listener emails and dig in to an incredible top five featuring"
00:23;00:32;"music of 1972 and today this is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:17;01:23;"Time Crisis back at it again. What's up Jake? Hey, how are you? Not bad. I enjoyed"
01:23;01:28;"the past week of rainy gloomy weather in LA. I found it very refreshing. Yeah, I"
01:28;01:32;"love it. There was a snowstorm in New York though. I was jealous of that. Really"
01:32;01:35;"jealous? Yeah man, I can't believe you're from the East Coast too. Yeah. You never"
01:35;01:40;"just dream about a snowy day? I don't romanticize that at all. I was talking"
01:40;01:42;"about that with some people the other day, some like California people who are like"
01:42;01:47;"yeah if you ever went back you would be like oh my god how did I do this? But I"
01:47;01:50;"remember like I even remember growing up and like being in like middle school and"
01:50;01:56;"there'd be some kids who'd be like oh my god I hate winter. Can't wait till my"
01:56;02:00;"family goes on a cruise in the Bahamas. Right. And I would just always be like yeah"
02:00;02:06;"I mean it is what it is man. Like of course spring is beautiful season, April"
02:06;02:11;"the flowers bloom and sh*t, but I just never related to that visceral hatred of winter."
02:11;02:17;"Did you hate it? No. As a kid I was into it and then I lived on the West Coast"
02:17;02:23;"pretty much my entire adult life except for two years in New York 2010 and 2011."
02:23;02:29;"I remember those years. I moved from Oakland, California to New York. Mm-hmm."
02:29;02:32;"And I remember thinking to myself I don't remember winter being this"
02:32;02:35;"traumatic when I was a kid. Well I guess in New York you're out on the street more."
02:35;02:40;"You get those wind tunnels. Oh the wind tunnels. I think I just got ruined living"
02:40;02:44;"in California for so many years. I just don't pine for it. Who knows maybe one"
02:44;02:50;"day you'll be back there. Oh I'll visit. Connecticut. Oh to live? That would be weird."
02:50;02:55;"Not happening. I don't know anyone in Connecticut anymore. Really? My parents"
02:55;02:57;"don't live there anymore. My high school friends that I'm still in"
02:57;03:02;"touch with like all three of them don't live in CT. Really? Apparently my town was"
03:02;03:07;"like super trumped out. Oh really? Even though Connecticut is super blue. Your"
03:07;03:14;"town was trump country? My town was always kind of Republican. Boy do you think Lonnie's dad voted for Trump?"
03:14;03:18;"Big time. Trump's gonna make them have McRibs year-round. For lower-level TC"
03:18;03:25;"heads Lonnie's dad was the dad of Lonnie, a childhood friend of Jake who had two"
03:25;03:29;"fridges and one of them was exclusively dedicated to McRibs because he wanted to"
03:29;03:34;"enjoy McRibs year-round. So he would scoop up a lot of McRibs, freeze them. He"
03:34;03:41;"needed that access 24/7. Yeah. Wait do they have McRibs year-round? No I think it's a"
03:41;03:45;"special thing. You know I don't think it's even every year. Really? I want to"
03:45;03:49;"say every like, don't quote me on this, but I feel like it's every couple"
03:49;03:54;"years it's like the McRib is back. You know it's like it's been gone for 18"
03:54;03:58;"months or it's been gone for two years. The McRib is back. We got a lot of good"
03:58;04:03;"emails after our show about where we talked about people who had two"
04:03;04:07;"fridges. I think one person said we actually had three fridges. Right. People"
04:07;04:10;"were just kind of updating us just letting us know. We live in a very"
04:10;04:14;"divided country. Some people barely struggling to have one fridge. Then the"
04:14;04:19;"millionaires and the billionaires got two, three, four, five fridges."

04:59;05:03;"- Jake and I saw a rock show last week."
05:03;05:04;"- That's right, man."
05:04;05:05;"Fun time."
05:05;05:07;"- We saw Jack White at the Mayan Theater."
05:07;05:09;"He just released an album, Friday."
05:09;05:10;"It's out now."
05:10;05:12;"So we went, it was a proper rock show."
05:12;05:15;"I wanted to tell you, after we said our goodbyes,"
05:15;05:19;"and I got an Uber to go home, the dude picked me up."
05:19;05:23;"He was a chill dude, 23 year old male from San Bernardino."
05:23;05:24;"- Strong."
05:24;05:26;"- He's about to move to Houston."
05:26;05:27;"He just got right into it."
05:27;05:28;"- Wow, man."
05:28;05:30;"- He's like, ""You from LA?"""
05:30;05:31;"I was like, ""Oh, no."
05:31;05:33;"""Yeah, I'm from San Bernardino, man."
05:33;05:35;"""I'm about to move to Houston, though."
05:35;05:37;"""It's real cheap out there, I'm gonna buy a house."""
05:37;05:39;"I was like, ""All right, that sounds like a plan."""
05:39;05:41;"And then he started talking music, and he's like,"
05:41;05:42;"""So what were you doing downtown?"""
05:42;05:44;"And I said, ""Oh, I was going to a concert."""
05:44;05:45;"And what was the concert?"
05:45;05:46;"It was Jack White."
05:46;05:48;"The way he set this up was so weird."
05:48;05:49;"Or I was just thrown for a loop."
05:49;05:50;"He goes, ""Oh, Jack White."""
05:50;05:51;"And he's driving the whole time."
05:51;05:54;"He goes, ""Oh, man, I did a remix for Jack White."""
05:54;05:55;"And I'm like, ""Yeah?"""
05:55;05:57;"He's like, ""Well, you know, not officially for him,"
05:57;05:58;"""but I mess around with music,"
05:58;06:01;"""and I did kind of a cover remix of one of his songs."
06:01;06:04;"""You know his song 'Seven Nation Army'?"""
06:04;06:05;"- Never heard it."
06:05;06:06;"- And I was like, ""Yeah, man."""
06:06;06:07;"He closed the show with it, and he's like,"
06:07;06:09;"""Oh, I bet he did."
06:09;06:10;"""That's a big one."""
06:10;06:11;"And he's like, ""Well, anyway, yeah,"
06:11;06:12;"""I did kind of like a cover remix."""
06:12;06:14;"""Yeah, hold on a second, I'll play it for you."
06:14;06:15;"""Literally, this is verbatim."
06:15;06:17;"""Hold on a second, I'll play it for you."""
06:17;06:20;"So I'm sitting in the back, he's driving on the highway,"
06:20;06:22;"and I'm waiting for him to pick up his phone"
06:22;06:24;"to play me the remix,"
06:24;06:25;"and then he totally throws me for a loop."
06:25;06:28;"- I gotta just pop home for a sec, get the CDR."
06:28;06:29;"- Yeah. - Pop it in the--"
06:29;06:30;"- It wasn't quite that crazy, but he goes,"
06:30;06:32;"""Yeah, hold on, just give me a second."
06:32;06:33;"""I'm gonna play it for you."""
06:33;06:35;"He kept using the word play it for you."
06:35;06:36;"And I was like, ""All right."""
06:36;06:37;"And he's like, ""Okay, you ready?"""
06:37;06:38;"And at this time, you know,"
06:38;06:39;"he had his hands on the wheel the whole time."
06:39;06:40;"I didn't see him touch his phone."
06:40;06:41;"And he goes, ""All right."""
06:41;06:45;"(imitates beatboxing)"
06:46;06:49;"(imitates beatboxing)"
06:49;06:54;"And he does this like minute-long beatbox version"
06:54;06:57;"that had a dubstep breakdown."
06:57;06:58;"And you know, we're like on the highway,"
06:58;07:00;"so it's really noisy, so I could just hear,"
07:00;07:01;"(imitates beatboxing)"
07:01;07:03;"- Was he smiling, or was he just like stone-faced?"
07:03;07:05;"- He was kind of stone-faced."
07:05;07:07;"He was a cool guy, I mean, I liked him."
07:07;07:09;"But I was just so thrown for a loop,"
07:09;07:11;"'cause he didn't say, ""Oh, you know, I beatbox."""
07:11;07:14;"And he truly said to me, ""I did a remix for Jack White."""
07:14;07:17;"Well, really, it's a cover remix."
07:17;07:19;"And I was like, ""Okay, I can't wait to hear this."""
07:19;07:22;"And then, (imitates beatboxing)"
07:22;07:23;"Yeah, and then there was this dubstep part,"
07:23;07:28;"where it's like, (imitates beatboxing)"
07:28;07:29;"As he did for about a minute,"
07:29;07:31;"and then he just kind of ended up, (imitates beatboxing)"
07:31;07:33;"He's just still driving."
07:33;07:34;"And I was like, ""That's cool."""
07:34;07:36;"Then he got like a tiny bit funny about it."
07:36;07:38;"He was just like, ""Yeah, yeah, I don't know."
07:38;07:39;"""I mean, you were talking about Jack White,"
07:39;07:41;"""so I wanted to play it for you."""
07:41;07:42;"- He kept using this language."
07:42;07:43;"- Play it."
07:43;07:44;"- Yeah, he kept using the language"
07:44;07:45;"of like a recording, which confused me."
07:45;07:46;"And I was like, ""No, that's cool."
07:46;07:48;"""You're actually really good, man."""
07:48;07:49;"And he's like, ""Oh, thanks."
07:49;07:51;"""Yeah, I don't, you know, you just saw Jack White,"
07:51;07:52;"""and I had this thing."""
07:52;07:53;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
07:53;07:57;"- And then a real deep silence descended on the car"
07:57;08:00;"for the last 20 minutes of the drive."
08:00;08:01;"- Yeah, kind of."
08:01;08:02;"- Oh, man."
08:02;08:04;"- No, I mean, then he was a chatty dude, so he--"
08:04;08:07;"- Do you think he knew who you were?"
08:07;08:07;"Your band?"
08:07;08:09;"- He 100% did not know who I was,"
08:09;08:14;"because when I got in the car, he said, ""Ezra?"""
08:14;08:15;"And I said, ""Yeah."""
08:15;08:17;"And he goes, ""That's a great name, man."""
08:17;08:18;"And I was like, ""Thanks."""
08:18;08:20;"And he goes, ""You know the show Pretty Little Liars?"""
08:20;08:23;"Which is a TV show, or was a TV show."
08:23;08:24;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I've heard about it."""
08:24;08:25;"'Cause one of the main characters named Ezra."
08:25;08:27;"He's like, ""Oh, yeah, there's a character Ezra Fitz."
08:27;08:28;"""Yeah, I like that show."""
08:28;08:30;"And he goes, ""I never met Ezra in real life, though."
08:30;08:33;"""I didn't even know if it was a real name or not."""
08:33;08:34;"And I was like, ""Oh, it's a real name."""
08:34;08:35;"He's like, ""Cool."""
08:35;08:38;"- You didn't know if it was a real name?"
08:38;08:39;"- He was a cool guy."
08:39;08:40;"- Wow, man."
08:40;08:41;"That's hilarious, dude."
08:41;08:44;"- I was so impressed and confused by the beatboxing."

09:50;09:53;"I keep wanting to say Seven Marry Three."
09:53;09:55;"Seven Nation Army."
09:55;09:57;"Is that the name of the song?"
09:57;09:57;"- Yes."
09:57;09:59;"- Seven Marry Three was a 90s band."
09:59;10:00;"- Yeah, Seven Nation Army."
10:00;10:02;"- Isn't it amazing how it's become"
10:02;10:05;"like an anthem of sports arenas?"
10:05;10:05;"- Oh yeah."
10:05;10:07;"- Like it's so unpredictable,"
10:07;10:11;"sort of what will like organically gonna take on that role."
10:11;10:12;"- Yeah, I mean people look back."
10:12;10:13;"- You know what I mean?"
10:13;10:15;"He's really didn't write it with that sort of intention."
10:15;10:17;"- I mean, yeah, it's not even like"

10:25;10:27;"People also don't stop and think"
10:27;10:29;"that Seven Nation Army is such a weird phrase."
10:29;10:30;"- What does that mean?"
10:30;10:33;"- I guess it could be like World War II or something,"
10:33;10:37;"but Seven Nation Army also to me sounds like biblical."
10:37;10:38;"You know what I mean?"
10:38;10:40;"Or like classical."
10:40;10:40;"- Yeah."
10:40;10:42;"- Like the Spartans were powerless"
10:42;10:43;"against the Seven Nation Army."
10:43;10:45;"- It was commandeer of the seven nations."
10:45;10:48;"- Alexander the Great united the Hittites,"
10:48;10:50;"the Phoenicians and the Spartans"
10:50;10:54;"forming a Seven Nation Army that marched on the barbarians."
10:54;10:55;"You'd like, you know, like that."
10:55;10:57;"That song is cool."
10:57;10:57;"- Yeah."
10:57;10:58;"- Truly nothing to do with sports."
10:58;11:01;"(imitates drum beat)"
11:01;11:02;"(imitates drum beat)"
11:02;11:05;"- But it really has replaced,"
11:05;11:07;"it's replaced Rock and Roll Part II."
11:07;11:09;"- Gary Glitter?"
11:09;11:10;"- What's the backstory in that?"
11:10;11:12;"Like, why that song?"
11:12;11:14;"What year is Rock and Roll Part II?"
11:14;11:16;"'74?"
11:16;11:17;"- Early '70s."
11:17;11:20;"- Is this like a glam artist?"
11:20;11:21;"- Yeah."
11:26;11:32;"- I remember just going to so many like,"
11:32;11:36;"hockey games in Hartford, Hartford Wheelers, growing up."
11:36;11:40;"I was in this band in college called the Buff Guys"
11:40;11:42;"and we'd open up all our shows with a cover."
11:42;11:43;"- Of this?"
11:43;11:44;"- We opened up, no, we, well,"
11:44;11:47;"a different cover every show."
11:47;11:49;"One show we opened up with this."
11:49;11:50;"(imitates drum beat)"
11:50;11:52;"- See, this song just kind of takes a long time"
11:52;11:54;"to get to the sports part."
11:57;12:05;"- It's pretty limp."
12:05;12:07;"I think they did like other versions"
12:07;12:09;"that were maybe the souped up version."
12:09;12:12;"- I mean, it doesn't have the immediacy of,"
12:12;12:15;"(imitates drum beat)"
12:15;12:17;"Yeah, you know, I think the backstory is that like,"
12:17;12:20;"it was, that became like this unofficial chant"
12:20;12:22;"at like one team in Italy"
12:22;12:24;"and then it was in a specific World Cup,"
12:24;12:27;"it kind of crossed over on the global stage."
12:27;12:28;"- The Gary Glitter or the White Stripes?"
12:28;12:29;"- No, the White Stripes."
12:29;12:31;"- Uh-huh, I hate this."
12:31;12:34;"Out at Fenway Park, they play ""Sweet Caroline"""
12:34;12:35;"by Neil Diamond every time."
12:35;12:37;"- Yeah, what's there to hate about that?"
12:37;12:38;"- Well, here's what I hate about it."
12:38;12:41;"They added this, ""So good, so good."""
12:41;12:42;"- Oh, right."
12:42;12:43;"- They added their own Boston version."

12:48;12:50;"♪ So good, so good ♪"
12:50;12:51;"- Oh, that's where that comes from?"
12:51;12:52;"- Yeah, yeah, the crowd like,"
12:52;12:54;"♪ So good, so good, so good ♪"
12:54;12:56;"- Also sometimes when you like sing it at karaoke,"
12:56;12:58;"just people at the karaoke place will do,"
12:58;12:59;"""So good, so good."""
12:59;13:02;"I didn't know that that specifically came from Fenway Park."
13:02;13:03;"- Yeah, man."
13:03;13:04;"- But what's the connection"
13:04;13:06;"to ""Sweet Caroline"" in Boston anyway?"
13:06;13:08;"- Someone's listening to the show right now"
13:08;13:10;"and being like, screaming at their radio that they know."
13:10;13:11;"Their radio."
13:11;13:12;"- Caroline O'Reilly."
13:12;13:13;"- Screaming at their laptop."
13:13;13:17;"- Was a well-known beer vendor at Fenway."
13:17;13:19;"- She worked there for 45 years."
13:19;13:23;"- Beloved by any true Red Sox fan."
13:23;13:25;"- I feel like it originated around the time"
13:25;13:27;"that the Sox finally won a World Series."
13:27;13:30;"Here we are, back to ""Time Crisis"" sports talk."
13:30;13:31;"- ""Time Crisis"" baseball."
13:31;13:33;"- Circa '03, like they like-"
13:33;13:34;"- That was the first time they won?"
13:34;13:37;"- Well, first time since 1918."
13:37;13:38;"I think it was around then."
13:38;13:40;"'03, '04, they were down three games"
13:40;13:41;"to none of the Yankees"
13:41;13:43;"and then won four in a row against the Yankees"
13:43;13:44;"and then swept the series."
13:44;13:45;"But I feel like the ""Sweet Caroline"" thing"
13:45;13:47;"started around then, but I could be wrong."

14:33;14:38;"Wait, do really big baseball fans"
14:38;14:40;"go watch their favorite teams at spring training?"
14:40;14:41;"- Big time."
14:41;14:42;"That's totally a thing."
14:42;14:44;"- Like if you're a hardcore Yankees fan,"
14:44;14:45;"you and some of your buddies"
14:45;14:48;"just rip down Florida for a weekend."
14:48;14:49;"- Fort Lauderdale, dude."
14:49;14:50;"- To watch?"
14:50;14:50;"- Yeah."
14:50;14:51;"- You sit in the stands."
14:51;14:53;"- Yeah, 'cause you can get really close to the players."
14:53;14:55;"You're just sitting in bleachers."
14:55;14:56;"- And just watch them work out."
14:56;14:59;"- In fact, this guy, Larry Mantle,"
14:59;15:04;"who hosts AirTalk on KPCC every weekday morning here in LA,"
15:04;15:06;"he was gone last week for four days."
15:06;15:10;"'Cause I usually catch him in the morning in my car"
15:10;15:11;"when I'm doing errands and stuff."
15:11;15:12;"And I was like, ""I wonder where Larry is these days."""
15:12;15:14;"And then he was back, like Friday of last week,"
15:14;15:18;"and he was like, ""I took my annual trip to Arizona"
15:18;15:21;"every spring to watch the Dodgers do spring training."""
15:21;15:23;"- And what are you watching?"
15:23;15:25;"You're watching them run suicides?"
15:25;15:26;"- No, no, they're doing scrimmage games."
15:26;15:28;"- You're just in the gym?"
15:28;15:30;"- You're probably watching some dudes stretching"
15:30;15:33;"and doing wind sprints and stuff."
15:33;15:36;"- If you pay extra, you can actually go in the gym"
15:36;15:38;"and just watch the guy on the treadmill."
15:38;15:39;"- Watch him in the showers."
15:39;15:40;"- Oh, God."
15:40;15:44;"Okay, so you're watching games, perhaps?"
15:44;15:45;"- Yeah, scrimmage games."
15:45;15:47;"You're just a baseball head."
15:47;15:49;"- Vampire weekends and spring training, maybe."
15:49;15:51;"- Start some vampire weekend scrimmage shows?"
15:51;15:55;"- The Black Diamond VIP package starts at 2,500 a head."
15:55;15:58;"You're gonna be in the locker room."
15:58;16:00;"You get a front row seat to practice."
16:00;16:01;"- You're gonna be drinking chamomile tea"
16:01;16:03;"with the band before the show."
16:03;16:04;"(laughing)"
16:04;16:07;"You are permitted one tequila shot post-show."
16:07;16:10;"Although we will take your phone."
16:10;16:11;"- We will take your phone."
16:11;16:12;"- The phone will be locked."
16:12;16:13;"That was another thing at the show."
16:13;16:15;"- Oh, you can eat chicken tenders."
16:15;16:17;"At the show last week."
16:17;16:20;"- Yeah, at the show last week, the Jack White show,"
16:20;16:21;"all the phones were locked."
16:21;16:23;"- Jack White says, ""Lock up your phones."""
16:23;16:25;"- Pretty dope move, I thought."
16:25;16:27;"But it's pretty intense for 1,500 people"
16:27;16:30;"or whatever the capacity of the Mayan theater was."
16:30;16:31;"- To lock up their phones."
16:31;16:32;"- 1,500, you know."
16:32;16:33;"- I'm with it."
16:33;16:35;"I don't think I would ever do it at a vampire weekend show"
16:35;16:37;"or ask people to do it, but."
16:37;16:39;"- It's not very in the ethos of vampire."
16:39;16:41;"- It is in the ethos of Jack White, though."
16:41;16:42;"- Oh, hell yeah."
16:42;16:43;"- I'm a Jack White fan."
16:43;16:44;"- You're there to rock out."
16:44;16:46;"- You're there to rock out."
16:46;16:48;"I think people get stressed out, naturally,"
16:48;16:50;"when their phone is locked up,"
16:50;16:53;"but you could always go check in the lobby if you want to."
16:53;16:56;"And also, every time I've been to some weird party"
16:56;16:59;"or event or show where they made you lock up your phone,"
16:59;17:01;"after a few minutes, you kind of look around,"
17:01;17:03;"nobody's on their phone, you do chill out a bit."
17:03;17:05;"- It's like 1997 again, man."
17:05;17:06;"- Yeah."
17:06;17:06;"- Good old days."
17:06;17:08;"- You just relax a little bit."
17:08;17:09;"Nothing wrong with that."
17:09;17:10;"- Speaking of Jack White, again,"
17:10;17:12;"I heard that there's a great interview with him."
17:12;17:14;"- Oh, coming up right after our show."
17:14;17:16;"- Yeah, he went on Lars Ulrich's show."
17:16;17:19;"- Every Sunday, you got Time Crisis."
17:19;17:21;"- 12 to 2, West Coast time."
17:21;17:24;"- West Coast, and then you have one hour chill out."
17:24;17:25;"- Palate cleanse."
17:25;17:27;"- Palate cleanser playlist show,"
17:27;17:28;"and then you got Lars Ulrich on the mic."
17:28;17:32;"- He's doing a tight hour interview with Jack White."
17:32;17:34;"- Interesting, so yeah, stick around"
17:34;17:35;"one hour after Time Crisis,"
17:35;17:37;"you can listen to Lars and Jack chop it up."
18:16;18:31;"- So the mailbag has been overflowing"
18:31;18:34;"since we started the 8-Minute Cape Cod"
18:34;18:36;"at gmail.com email list."
18:36;18:39;"We got one from Emily Allen Worrell,"
18:39;18:41;"and I think we need to address this one."
18:41;18:42;"- Okay."
18:42;18:44;"- And we got called out, Jake."
18:44;18:45;"- Did we?"
18:45;18:46;"- A little bit, gently."
18:46;18:47;"- I like the email."
18:47;18:48;"- It's a great email."
18:48;18:52;"- Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
18:52;18:54;"- Dearest TC crew, I wanna start by saying"
18:54;18:56;"my husband and I are huge TC heads,"
18:56;18:57;"and we love the show."
18:57;18:59;"I love TC couples."
18:59;19:00;"- Yeah, just like a couple,"
19:00;19:02;"like snuggling up on the couch."
19:02;19:03;"- Yeah."
19:03;19:04;"- Sunday afternoon."
19:04;19:05;"- Someone's working out in the yard."
19:05;19:07;"Babe, come in, TC time."
19:07;19:09;"- I got the Doritos ready."
19:09;19:10;"- Maybe when TC comes on,"
19:10;19:12;"they just jump in the truck and just drive?"
19:12;19:13;"- Oh, yeah, dude."
19:13;19:14;"Sunday drive?"
19:14;19:16;"- Sunday drive."
19:16;19:18;"Okay, but I've got a bone to pick."
19:18;19:19;"- Uh-oh."
19:19;19:21;"- You have often referenced the Sooner State,"
19:21;19:23;"the great state of Oklahoma,"
19:23;19:24;"but not always in the best light."
19:24;19:27;"Now, I understand we are quintessential flyover country,"
19:27;19:29;"but we have a lot of great music history."
19:29;19:30;"I thought it was funny when you referenced music"
19:30;19:32;"that would be played in a Tulsa Marriott,"
19:32;19:34;"astute abso,"
19:34;19:35;"but the assumption that Jason Aldean"
19:35;19:37;"was from Broken Arrow made me think"
19:37;19:40;"TC might need an oaky music history lesson."
19:40;19:41;"Okay, well, first of all,"
19:41;19:44;"we got nothing against the great state of Oklahoma."
19:44;19:45;"- Hell no."
19:45;19:46;"- I remember we guessed that maybe Jason Aldean"
19:46;19:47;"was from Oklahoma,"
19:47;19:49;"but that was just 'cause he's a country musician."
19:49;19:50;"- Have you played there?"
19:50;19:51;"- Oh, yeah."
19:51;19:52;"- Norman?"
19:52;19:53;"- We played in Norman and Tulsa."
19:53;19:54;"- I've never been to Oklahoma."
19:54;19:55;"- Really?"
19:55;19:56;"- I need to go."
19:56;19:57;"- You gotta go, man."
19:57;19:58;"Check it out."
19:58;20:00;"I don't know how often we talk about Oklahoma, but--"
20:00;20:02;"- I think it's like shorthand for like--"
20:02;20:03;"- Random?"
20:03;20:06;"- Random part of America, like Ohio or Oklahoma."
20:06;20:08;"It's shorthand."
20:08;20:08;"- Right."
20:08;20:10;"- If you live there, it's not random."
20:10;20:10;"- That's right."
20:10;20:11;"- LA's random."
20:11;20:12;"- Connecticut's random."
20:12;20:14;"- CT is very random."
20:14;20:15;"(laughing)"
20:15;20:16;"Actually, quick aside,"
20:16;20:20;"I feel like Connecticut has the least amount of credibility"
20:20;20:24;"in terms of reputation of any state in the union."
20:24;20:25;"- It's like Delaware, kind of."
20:25;20:27;"- Right, but Delaware at least has,"
20:27;20:29;"going for it, it's tiny size."
20:29;20:31;"That's at least sort of interesting."
20:31;20:33;"- Right, like Rhode Island is more interesting"
20:33;20:35;"than Connecticut because at least it's small."
20:35;20:36;"- And it has--"
20:36;20:37;"- It's got a weirder name."
20:37;20:41;"- Yeah, and it has those weird like Gilded Age mansions"
20:41;20:44;"that are there, and Providence is a cool city, straight up."
20:44;20:46;"- Yeah, Connecticut has no cool cities."
20:46;20:47;"- It doesn't."
20:47;20:49;"And like the reputation of Connecticut"
20:49;20:53;"is that it's like rich, eye banker, preppy weirdos."
20:53;20:54;"- Right."
20:54;20:56;"- Which is true of the southwest corner, Fairfield County."
20:56;20:58;"- Yeah, those are the people in Greenwich"
20:58;20:58;"who commute into New York."
20:58;20:59;"- Yeah, Greenwich, Stanford."
20:59;21:00;"- New Canaan."
21:00;21:02;"- But the rest of the state is like really pretty similar"
21:02;21:04;"to like Jersey, for instance."
21:04;21:05;"- Right."
21:05;21:06;"- It's just sort of suburbs, working class."
21:06;21:10;"- Jersey is in the cultural imagination"
21:10;21:12;"is so much (beep) than Connecticut"
21:12;21:13;"that actually it's an asset."
21:13;21:14;"- Right, right."
21:14;21:15;"- You know what I mean?"
21:15;21:16;"- Yeah, you got New York."
21:16;21:17;"- 'Cause Jersey's not rando."
21:17;21:20;"Jersey like to some people epitomizes like trashiness"
21:20;21:25;"and like the joysy accent and the toxic waste."
21:25;21:25;"- Right."
21:25;21:29;"- So at least Jersey has like character."
21:29;21:31;"And then we also do have gravitas, you know,"
21:31;21:33;"with the Springsteen and--"
21:33;21:33;"- Sopranos."
21:33;21:35;"- Sopranos and stuff, but there's not gonna be"
21:35;21:36;"Connecticut Sopranos."
21:36;21:39;"- No, there's not gonna be a Connecticut shore."
21:39;21:40;"- Yeah."
21:40;21:41;"- I mean, if there was, it would be like--"
21:41;21:42;"- Even though there is beautiful coastline."
21:42;21:44;"- No, I'm saying like there's like the Jersey shore,"
21:44;21:47;"which is like the trashy representation of Jersey."
21:47;21:48;"You're not gonna have that for Connecticut."
21:48;21:50;"It's not gonna ring true, even though it's there."
21:50;21:51;"- Connecticut's a whatever state."
21:51;21:53;"Oklahoma has more flavor than Connecticut."
21:53;21:55;"- Oh, big time."
21:55;21:56;"I mean, it's the Okies."
21:56;21:57;"- Right."
21:57;21:58;"- It's the Dust Bowl."
21:58;21:59;"- Oklahoma has some real history."
21:59;21:59;"Well, and anyway, I'm just--"
21:59;22:01;"- I'm just saying, Connecticut's the lamest state."
22:01;22:02;"- Well, actually, I think--"
22:02;22:05;"- I feel embarrassed when I tell people I'm from CT."
22:05;22:06;"- Yeah."
22:06;22:07;"- I usually go, ""Um, East Coast."""
22:07;22:09;"- And you're born in CT, too."
22:09;22:10;"- Yeah."
22:10;22:11;"- I'm glad I'm from Jersey."
22:11;22:13;"- It's really legit, man."
22:13;22:14;"- Jersey's legit."
22:14;22:16;"- Imagine if your band was from CT."
22:16;22:17;"- Oh, yeah, it'd be a wrap."
22:17;22:19;"- It's tough to get off the ground if your band's from CT."
22:19;22:20;"- Yeah, nah."
22:20;22:22;"- Mayer got off the ground."
22:22;22:25;"- Mayer and Rivers Cuomo, but they're not out there"
22:25;22:26;"repping it."

23:09;23:10;"- She says she thinks TC might need"
23:10;23:12;"an Oki music history lesson."
23:12;23:15;"Is Oki a derogatory term?"
23:15;23:16;"- No."
23:16;23:19;"- Well, I think it was in like ""Grapes of Wrath"" day."
23:19;23:20;"- Oh, was it derogatory?"
23:20;23:22;"- Oh, yeah, because they were coming to California"
23:22;23:24;"and getting like spit on."
23:24;23:24;"- Right, okay."
23:24;23:27;"- Okay, but I'm reading her."
23:27;23:29;"So I'm not even from Oklahoma, but now I'm reading her email."
23:29;23:31;"Let's start with when you did the top artists"
23:31;23:32;"from each state."
23:32;23:33;"Oh, that was like an old episode."
23:33;23:35;"- That's a deep callback."
23:35;23:35;"- Shout out to Emily."
23:35;23:39;"- I think that was the fourth of July, 2016 episode."
23:39;23:40;"- Okay, they were in line."
23:40;23:42;"They really are huge TC heads."
23:42;23:44;"Oklahoma's top artist is Garth Brooks, of course."
23:44;23:46;"He's the best-selling solo albums artist in the US."
23:46;23:48;"But when GB's music wasn't on Apple Music,"
23:48;23:51;"you played a Florida Georgia Line cover."
23:51;23:53;"Now I like FGL as much as the next TC head,"
23:53;23:55;"but there are so many Oklahoma artists"
23:55;23:56;"that you could have used instead."
23:56;23:58;"Wait, wait, I don't even remember this."
23:58;24:00;"Is Florida Georgia Line from Oklahoma?"
24:00;24:03;"- No, we played, wait, she says that we played"
24:03;24:06;"a Florida Georgia Line version of a Garth Brooks song."
24:06;24:07;"- Oh, oh, okay."
24:07;24:09;"- But this is the best sentence ever."
24:09;24:12;"Now I like FGL as much as the next TC head."
24:12;24:14;"- But there are so many Oklahoma artists"
24:14;24:15;"that you could have used instead."
24:15;24:18;"So let's take a deep dive into Oklahoma's music history."
24:18;24:21;"Our first stop is someone who has been a significant voice"
24:21;24:22;"in both music and politics, Woody Guthrie."
24:22;24:24;"- Straight up. - Straight up."
24:24;24:27;"And we know with Woody Guthrie, there's no Bob Dylan,"
24:27;24:28;"there's no Jack White."
24:28;24:30;"- There's no Bruce Springsteen."
24:30;24:31;"- There's no Bruce Springsteen."
24:31;24:34;"So, so many of these classic artists,"
24:34;24:36;"their lineage traces right back to Oklahoma."
24:36;24:39;"Born in Okemah, Guthrie wrote the timeless American tune"
24:39;24:40;"""This Land is Your Land."""
24:40;24:42;"Shout out to your duet with Bernie."
24:42;24:44;"Woody Guthrie was a prominent voice for the working class"
24:44;24:46;"and he famously played a guitar that said,"
24:46;24:48;"""This machine kills fascists."""
24:48;24:49;"To learn more about this folk hero,"
24:49;24:51;"I highly recommend touring the Woody Guthrie Center"
24:51;24:53;"in Tulsa. - I would love to do that."
24:53;24:56;"- Hell yeah, next time we're in Tulsa, I'm hitting that up."
24:56;24:58;"You can't mention Tulsa without talking about Bob Wills,"
24:58;24:59;"AKA the King of Western Swing."
24:59;25:01;"- Oh, so he's from, I didn't know that,"
25:01;25:02;"I thought he was from Texas."
25:02;25:03;"- Well, because he had his group,"
25:03;25:06;"and you know, as she says, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys."
25:06;25:08;"But they rose to stardom in Tulsa,"
25:08;25:11;"where they broadcast a daily 45 minute live radio show"
25:11;25:13;"from Cain's Ballroom, a historic music venue"
25:13;25:14;"that still puts on six shows."
25:14;25:15;"- That's tight."
25:15;25:16;"- There's a musical styling named after"
25:16;25:19;"the green country capital called Tulsa Sound,"
25:19;25:22;"which is a mixture of rockabilly country, rock and blues."
25:22;25:25;"The Kings of Tulsa Sound were Leon Russell and J.J. Cale."
25:25;25:26;"Oh, I love J.J. Cale."
25:26;25:28;"Songs written by Cale have been recorded"
25:28;25:30;"and covered by many TC faves."
25:30;25:33;"Eric Clapton, Jerry Garcia, Leonard Skinner,"
25:33;25:37;"John Mayer, Phish, I love J.J. Cale."
25:37;25:38;"He's a really slept on."
25:38;25:40;"- He had a studio, I think, in Tulsa"
25:40;25:42;"in like the early mid 70s."
25:42;25:43;"- Really? - Yeah."
25:43;25:47;"- She goes on to list some emerging artists from Oklahoma,"
25:47;25:49;"the future-- - What was--"
25:49;25:53;"- Parker, I don't think I can list all of them."
25:53;25:54;"We could post them somewhere."
25:54;25:56;"Parker Millsap, John Moreland, Samantha Crane,"
25:56;25:59;"John Fulbright, Wink Bircham, among others."
25:59;26:01;"And then Oklahoma is home to many prominent"
26:01;26:03;"modern country artists, Garth Brooks, Reba McIntyre,"
26:03;26:05;"Blake Shelton, Toby Keith."
26:05;26:06;"Oklahoma's really punching above its weight."
26:06;26:08;"- Wait, they all live there?"
26:08;26:11;"- Well, she says home to, I don't know."
26:11;26:14;"- Can you imagine that, like a subdivision of McMansions"
26:14;26:16;"with all of the heavyweights of country live there?"
26:16;26:18;"- So she says, ""Outside of the country genre,"
26:18;26:21;"""we relay claim to artists such as All-American Rejects,"
26:21;26:23;"""Color Me Bad, Hanson, The Gap Band,"""
26:23;26:26;"oh, The Gap Band, wow, ""and a few indie darlings"
26:26;26:27;"""like St. Vincent and the Flaming Lips."""
26:27;26:29;"Oh yeah, the Flaming Lips, big Oklahoma."
26:29;26:31;"""Not to mention the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,"
26:31;26:33;"""Oklahoma."
26:33;26:35;"""Lastly, where we live in Bardizzlesville"
26:35;26:37;"""is where one of the largest classical music festivals"
26:37;26:39;"""takes place, OK Mozart."
26:39;26:41;"""We even have a Frank Lloyd Wright skyscraper here."""
26:41;26:42;"- What?"
26:42;26:45;"- Also, did you know that Sonic is headquartered in OKC?"
26:45;26:47;"Just a little corporate food history tie-in."
26:47;26:50;"- It's time for-- - Corporate food history."
26:51;26:52;"- News to me."
26:52;26:53;"- So if you're ever in Oklahoma,"
26:53;26:56;"my husband Josh and I would love to show y'all around."
26:56;26:57;"Hopefully we can show you that Oklahoma's a state"
26:57;26:59;"with a storied history steeped in our Native American"
26:59;27:03;"heritage, our socialist roots, and our red dirt spirit."
27:03;27:04;"From the Tulsa race riots to the Dust Bowl"
27:04;27:08;"to the OKC bombing, we faced our trials and tribulations."
27:08;27:10;"But we know that we belong to the land"
27:10;27:12;"and the land we belong to is grand."
27:12;27:16;"Labor, Omnia, Vincent, Emily,"
27:16;27:17;"which I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right,"
27:17;27:21;"I believe that's a Latin phrase used by,"
27:21;27:23;"can we get a number crunch on that?"
27:23;27:25;"- P.S. everyone support the teacher's strike"
27:25;27:27;"in Oklahoma in April."
27:27;27:29;"- Oh yeah, we got teachers all over this great land,"
27:29;27:32;"including some pretty red states, going on strike."
27:32;27:33;"- Yep."
27:33;27:34;"Great email, Emily."
27:34;27:36;"- Thanks for setting us straight."
27:36;27:39;"So the phrase that she used, Labor, Omnia, Vincent,"
27:39;27:42;"is a Latin phrase meaning work conquers all."
27:42;27:44;"And it's associated with the U.S. labor movement."
27:44;27:47;"- I mean, Oklahoma might even be like a top 10 music state."
27:47;27:48;"Really when you get down to it."
27:48;27:49;"- Per capita?"
27:49;27:51;"- Definitely per capita, but I'm just saying like--"
27:51;27:53;"- In Connecticut might be bottom five."
27:53;27:54;"- Oh, easily."
27:54;27:55;"I think it's dead last."
27:55;27:56;"- It's garbage."
27:56;27:57;"- I agree."
27:57;27:59;"No, I mean, also just in terms of the sheer number"
27:59;28:01;"of major artists coming out of the state,"
28:01;28:03;"I think Oklahoma's top 10."
28:03;28:08;"- In terms of a small population producing important artists,"
28:08;28:11;"it's up there with like Jamaica, Ireland."
28:11;28:12;"These are small places."
28:12;28:14;"- Minnesota."
28:14;28:16;"Minnesota is punching above its weight."
28:16;28:17;"- I mean, obviously there's like"
28:17;28:19;"the California, New York, and Texas."
28:19;28:20;"A lot of big artists come out of there."
28:20;28:21;"- And those are massive states."
28:21;28:22;"- Duh."
28:22;28:23;"- And she's also right that Oklahoma's faced"
28:23;28:25;"a lot of trials and tribulations,"
28:25;28:26;"but it still produced a lot of great music."
28:26;28:30;"Whereas pampered Connecticut, that Southwestern corner,"
28:30;28:31;"all that big money."
28:31;28:33;"- Cranking out John Mayer, dude."
28:33;28:36;"(laughing)"
28:36;28:37;"- All right, from now on,"
28:37;28:39;"Time Crisis is a pro Oklahoma show"
28:39;28:41;"and an anti-Connecticut show."
28:41;28:42;"- Oof."
28:42;28:46;"- Not gonna have any argument from me on this one."

30:53;30:56;"we're now joined in the studio by Chris Baio."
30:56;30:57;"- What's up?"
30:57;30:57;"Are you from CT?"
30:57;30:58;"- No. - No."
30:58;31:01;"- But you have spent significant amounts of time in CT."
31:01;31:03;"- Definitely thrown down in CT,"
31:03;31:05;"and it's, I guess it's like a 15 minute drive"
31:05;31:06;"from where I grew up."
31:06;31:07;"- Wait, where'd you grow up?"
31:07;31:09;"- Westchester, town of Bronxville, New York."
31:09;31:10;"- That's basically CT."
31:10;31:13;"- Yeah, I mean, arguably Westchester County"
31:13;31:17;"and Southwestern Connecticut are one mega area."
31:17;31:19;"- That's like Don Draper country."
31:19;31:21;"- When you grow up on that side of the border"
31:21;31:24;"in New York state,"
31:24;31:27;"are there any reasons why people are like,"
31:27;31:29;"oh, we got to rip over to Connecticut, I'm not paying."
31:29;31:30;"Like, do you go over there for gas"
31:30;31:33;"or like Costco or anything like that?"
31:33;31:34;"- I honestly can't remember."
31:34;31:36;"- Do you ever go to shows in New Haven"
31:36;31:38;"or like Toad's Place or anything?"
31:38;31:41;"- I would go to some like hardcore shows in Danbury."
31:41;31:42;"- Yeah, Danbury?"
31:42;31:44;"- Yeah, and I think I played in Danbury once"
31:44;31:45;"when I was growing up."
31:45;31:48;"- Actually, okay, let's just like slow a roll a little bit"
31:48;31:52;"on CT, 'cause there's the famed CT HC scene."
31:52;31:52;"- Oh yeah."
31:52;31:53;"- All right, Connecticut hardcore."
31:53;31:56;"- That's like, maybe it's greatest musical legacy."
31:56;31:57;"- Who is it that counts?"
31:57;31:58;"- I don't either. - Is Earth Crisis?"
31:58;32:01;"- Do you know who's from CT also is Moby."
32:01;32:02;"- Oh yeah."
32:02;32:03;"- He came out of the CT HC scene."
32:03;32:04;"- He was a Connecticut hardcore dude."
32:04;32:07;"- Oh, not to name drop, but when I met Moby"
32:07;32:09;"and I told him I was from Bronxville, he's like,"
32:09;32:11;"oh, love the architecture in Bronxville."
32:11;32:12;"- Really?"
32:12;32:12;"- That's a cool name."
32:12;32:13;"- I was blown away."
32:13;32:15;"I normally wouldn't share a story like that,"
32:15;32:15;"but I was just."
32:15;32:16;"- Is he talking like."
32:16;32:19;"- Moby's really cool, I thought when I met him."
32:19;32:20;"He's a cool guy."
32:20;32:21;"- I bet."
32:21;32:22;"- Is he talking about."
32:22;32:23;"- No Moby, I know you're from Connecticut,"
32:23;32:25;"but you're a cool guy, man."
32:25;32:27;"- I'll give you a pass on this one."
32:27;32:28;"No, is he talking about the architecture"
32:28;32:31;"on like the main drag or like the homes?"
32:31;32:34;"- I didn't grill him, I just took the compliment."
32:34;32:36;"- He might've just been referring to the stately homes."
32:36;32:40;"You know, Moby is a kind of into flipping houses in LA now."
32:40;32:41;"- Is he really?"
32:41;32:42;"- I went to an open."
32:42;32:43;"- It's kind of cold."
32:43;32:44;"It's kind of ruthless, right?"
32:44;32:45;"It's like some like."
32:45;32:47;"- Well, okay, maybe is flipping house derogatory."
32:47;32:48;"- Yeah."
32:48;32:51;"- So he's bought houses, renovated them,"
32:51;32:52;"and then resold them for higher prices."
32:52;32:53;"- Sizable profits."
32:53;32:55;"- But yeah, I guess the flipping,"
32:55;32:56;"maybe flipping implies that you did"
32:56;32:58;"like a (beep) renovation."
32:58;32:59;"- Yeah, flipping implies very quick."
32:59;33:01;"Like you're putting in Home Depot cabinets,"
33:01;33:02;"bad linoleum."
33:02;33:03;"- Okay, so no, no."
33:03;33:04;"- And you're just like turning it around."
33:04;33:06;"- No, Moby's not hitting the depot."
33:06;33:08;"But there was a house on the market in LA"
33:08;33:10;"and there was an open house and I was in the neighborhood,"
33:10;33:11;"so I went to check it out."
33:11;33:12;"And I'm sure this is not him,"
33:12;33:14;"but the selling agent,"
33:14;33:16;"I think we've talked on Time Crisp before"
33:16;33:18;"about the hilariously over the top language"
33:18;33:19;"of real estate listings."
33:19;33:20;"- Yeah."
33:20;33:22;"- And this one said,"
33:22;33:26;"""The opening line from the creative force known as Moby"
33:26;33:28;"comes,"" you know, whatever."
33:28;33:31;"- The address, 2119 Briarcliff Lane."
33:31;33:33;"- It was like some (beep) like that."
33:33;33:34;"And then it was, you know,"
33:34;33:38;"a nice old 1920s LA house that had been renovated tastefully."
33:38;33:40;"And then when you walked in in the living room,"
33:40;33:41;"the selling agents were there"
33:41;33:45;"and they were like bumping a little Moby on the speaker."
33:45;33:47;"- Wow, nice."
33:47;33:48;"So I wonder what's in it for him."
33:48;33:50;"I mean, sure he's making some money,"
33:50;33:52;"but it must be like a fun kind of."
33:52;33:54;"- He clearly has an interest in architecture"
33:54;33:57;"as I can verify from the conversation I had with him."
33:57;33:58;"- There you go."
33:58;33:59;"- It's a outlet for his expression."
33:59;34:00;"I totally get it."
34:00;34:03;"- Yeah, I mean, it's like you're Moby."
34:03;34:05;"You're sitting on all that-"
34:05;34:06;"- Play money."
34:06;34:07;"- All that play money."
34:07;34:08;"It's another way to invest your money."
34:08;34:10;"It's arguably more creative."
34:10;34:11;"- I love it."
34:11;34:12;"- See his houses."
34:12;34:14;"- I'll let you know next time one's on the market,"
34:14;34:15;"we can hit up an open house"
34:15;34:18;"from the creative force known as Moby."
34:18;34:20;"But the funny thing about it too is like,"
34:20;34:24;"you know, he's very specific hallmarks of his music."
34:24;34:25;"You know? - Yeah."
34:25;34:27;"- Like Moby music has had a sound"
34:27;34:29;"or various sounds over the ages."
34:29;34:31;"Then you go to the house and it's not like,"
34:31;34:32;"it just was like a nice house."
34:32;34:35;"- It's an old house that's tastefully redone."
34:35;34:38;"- Yeah, you'd really have to rack your brain to be like,"
34:38;34:40;"if you were like assigned a essay,"
34:40;34:41;"what are the-"
34:41;34:42;"- Aesthetic continuity."
34:42;34:43;"- Yeah, what are the aesthetic continuity"
34:43;34:48;"between Moby play and 2145 Briarcliff Road?"
34:48;34:51;"(laughs)"

36:00;36:01;"- Good to be back."
36:01;36:02;"- Good to have you back on the program."
36:02;36:05;"- I brought $2 'cause last time I was here a year and a half"
36:05;36:08;"ago, I borrowed $2 from Jake to tip the valet guy."
36:08;36:09;"I just remembered it. - What the hell?"
36:09;36:10;"- Wow."
36:10;36:11;"- What?"
36:11;36:12;"How did you remember that, man?"
36:12;36:13;"- I'll take it."

36:21;36:23;"The cosmic balance has been restored."
36:23;36:24;"- Put that in my wallet."
36:24;36:27;"- So I haven't followed this story very closely."
36:27;36:29;"I was kind of introduced to this story actually"
36:29;36:31;"via your Instagram, which, you know,"
36:31;36:33;"sometimes in the social media age,"
36:33;36:37;"you come upon something and you're first introduced"
36:37;36:39;"to a meme or a story or a campaign"
36:39;36:41;"and you realize you already missed half of it"
36:41;36:43;"because people are already talking about it"
36:43;36:45;"and you're seeing the meta commentary about it."
36:45;36:49;"But what I'm talking about is Sting and Shaggy."
36:49;36:50;"- Yes."
36:50;36:51;"- And for people who don't know,"
36:51;36:53;"Shaggy is a dance hall artist."
36:53;36:56;"Probably his biggest hit in America was ""It Wasn't Me"""
36:56;36:58;"featuring Rick Rock."
36:58;36:59;"You remember that song, Jake?"
36:59;37:00;"- I don't think I do."
37:00;37:01;"Mr. Bombastic?"
37:01;37:02;"If I heard it, I'd probably--"
37:02;37:03;"- Oh yeah, what about Mr. Bombastic in the '90s?"
37:03;37:04;"- The titles are not resonating,"
37:04;37:06;"but if I heard the song, I'd probably--"
37:06;37:06;"- Definitely."
37:06;37:08;"- You don't remember,"
37:08;37:09;"♪ And then I had it on the counter ♪"
37:09;37:10;"It wasn't me."
37:10;37:11;"♪ Na na na na na na na ♪"
37:11;37:13;"It wasn't me."
37:13;37:14;"♪ She even had me on camera ♪"
37:14;37:15;"- Oh yeah, sure, gotcha."
37:15;37:16;"That's Shaggy?"
37:16;37:18;"- Yeah."
37:18;37:19;"- Is he British?"
37:19;37:20;"- No, he's from Jamaica. - I think he's"
37:20;37:21;"Jamaican American."
37:21;37:24;"- Yeah, New York and Jamaica, he grew up between the two."
37:24;37:26;"- So he's teaming up with Sting?"
37:26;37:29;"Somehow in my head, Shaggy was DJ Shadow."
37:29;37:31;"- Wait, what?"
37:31;37:32;"Wait, what do you--"
37:32;37:33;"- I don't know."
37:33;37:34;"- What?"
37:34;37:37;"- Because both names start with S-H"
37:37;37:39;"and I don't know who either of them are."
37:39;37:40;"- Okay."
37:40;37:42;"- So DJ Shadow's like a British DJ, right?"
37:42;37:45;"- DJ Shadow's from Davis, California."
37:45;37:47;"- Okay, I don't know anything, forget it."
37:47;37:49;"- What is this Shaggy and Sting thing?"
37:49;37:54;"- Basically last fall, I got really back into Sting."
37:54;37:56;"I was listening a ton to Synchronicity"
37:56;38:00;"and 10 Summoner's Tales, just like cranking 'em nonstop,"
38:00;38:02;"probably from mid-October to the end of the year."
38:02;38:06;"Then I also have an annual Christmas party called Peckmas"
38:06;38:09;"in the neighborhood I live in called Peckham."
38:09;38:10;"And there are two parts of the party."
38:10;38:14;"One, we get together with friends and sing holiday classics."
38:14;38:16;"And then the second part later in the evening"
38:16;38:17;"is the dance party."
38:17;38:20;"And the playlist is usually like mid-90s"
38:20;38:23;"to early 2000s rap and R&B hits."
38:23;38:25;"And Shaggy actually features very prominently"
38:25;38:27;"on that playlist."
38:27;38:29;"I also ended up having an emergency New Year's Eve party"
38:29;38:31;"and I didn't have time to prepare a new playlist."
38:31;38:33;"So I recycled the one from the party"
38:33;38:34;"I had thrown a couple of weeks ago."
38:34;38:38;"So again, I was just listening a ton to Shaggy and Sting"
38:39;38:41;"and then I saw, I just, you know,"
38:41;38:45;"booted up Twitter one day and saw that Sting and Shaggy"
38:45;38:47;"had made an entire collaborative album."
38:47;38:49;"This was like beginning of January"
38:49;38:51;"and that it was coming out on 4/20"
38:51;38:53;"and already just really appealed to me."
38:53;38:57;"- Is it branded as like a weed thing?"
38:57;38:59;"- Well, no."
38:59;39:01;"So from my perspective, I see this album,"
39:01;39:04;"two artists that I love are dropping a record on 4/20."
39:04;39:09;"And then I saw they played an event around Super Bowl Sunday,"
39:09;39:11;"you know, just that weekend in Minnesota."
39:11;39:14;"And I saw a photo of the two of them with Guy Fieri."
39:14;39:16;"And at that moment I was just like blown away."
39:16;39:19;"It seemed like this whole album was tailor-made"
39:19;39:23;"to go as viral as possible for as long as possible."
39:23;39:24;"So I had already been thinking about the record"
39:24;39:27;"and reading about it a bunch for like three weeks."
39:27;39:30;"- And also just from my perspective is that"
39:30;39:32;"when people like make fun of Sting,"
39:32;39:34;"like solo Sting or late period Sting,"
39:34;39:38;"it's because they describe him as being like self-serious,"
39:38;39:39;"which is not how I feel about Sting,"
39:39;39:40;"but it's like, they think of him"
39:40;39:41;"as being this very serious guy"
39:41;39:45;"who's into like tantric sex and plays the lute."
39:45;39:47;"He's not known for his, you know,"
39:47;39:50;"wacky meme-esque sense of humor."
39:50;39:51;"- Yeah, not at all."
39:51;39:53;"But so I saw all these things"
39:53;39:55;"and I really liked the first single,"
39:55;39:56;"which is called ""Don't Make Me Wait."""
39:56;39:59;"And so I just started doing a deep dive on press"
39:59;40:00;"that they were doing."
40:00;40:01;"I mean, I know they played a bunch of the Grammys,"
40:01;40:04;"but they're just doing so much press"
40:04;40:05;"and so many interviews."
40:05;40:09;"And I was truly blown away by their chemistry"
40:09;40:11;"in terms of doing interviews, just cracking jokes."
40:11;40:13;"It's the kind of thing you can't really fake."
40:13;40:16;"And they seemed down for whatever."
40:16;40:19;"They definitely subscribe to the yes end school"
40:19;40:20;"of like improv comedy."
40:20;40:21;"(laughing)"
40:21;40:23;"They're just, they're doing interviews all day"
40:23;40:24;"and they're killing every single one."
40:24;40:29;"So I sort of just started posting little bits"
40:29;40:31;"of press they were doing or interviews"
40:31;40:33;"or little performances."
40:33;40:37;"They like performed at a wine festival in Florence,"
40:37;40:39;"in Italy, and there was a Daily Mail article"
40:39;40:41;"that said a grape friendship is brewing,"
40:41;40:43;"which I really liked."
40:43;40:48;"And I guess what ended up happening is my friend, McKee,"
40:48;40:51;"is friends with their publicist."
40:51;40:51;"- Whoa."
40:51;40:55;"- And I think she enjoyed the sting and shaggy content"
40:55;40:56;"I was bringing to my Instagram stories."
40:56;41:00;"So she told their publicist about this."
41:00;41:02;"Then later I found out that our travel agent, Lisa,"
41:02;41:04;"is also friends with their publicist"
41:04;41:07;"and also told them about these posts I was making"
41:07;41:08;"on Instagram about sting and shaggy."
41:08;41:11;"So that's how a little buzz was created,"
41:11;41:13;"hearing it from two different sources."
41:13;41:16;"- And word got back to the dynamic duo."
41:16;41:20;"- And then what they did was they taped"
41:20;41:23;"a personalized message to me, thanking me for my support."
41:23;41:24;"- I'm pulling this up right now."
41:24;41:26;"So this is where I entered this."
41:26;41:28;"Straight up, I didn't even know these guys"
41:28;41:29;"were making an album together."
41:29;41:31;"Wait, I really have not had my ear to this tree."
41:31;41:33;"You know, I heard some vague thing"
41:33;41:35;"because I didn't watch the Grammys this year"
41:35;41:36;"and I saw some vague reference"
41:36;41:38;"to sting and shaggy performing together."
41:38;41:41;"But the Grammys, as we know well,"
41:41;41:43;"there's nothing they love more than a fun combo."
41:43;41:44;"- Yeah, totally."
41:44;41:45;"- So I thought maybe that's a one-off,"
41:45;41:46;"so I didn't think twice about it."
41:46;41:50;"And then I'm scrolling Instagram one day and I see this."
41:50;41:51;"- Hi, Chris."
41:51;41:52;"- What's up, Chris?"
41:52;41:53;"This is Shaggy."
41:53;41:53;"- This is Sting."
41:53;41:55;"- And we know you've been posting"
41:55;41:57;"about this collaboration."
41:57;41:58;"We know you've been supporting us."
41:58;42:00;"We just want to say thank you, bro."
42:00;42:02;"And I'm saying big up to you and your band."
42:02;42:05;"It's been an amazing collaboration."
42:05;42:07;"I can't wait for you to hear the record."
42:07;42:09;"- And we're gonna have a vampire weekend this weekend."
42:09;42:12;"(laughing)"
42:12;42:15;"- Oh my God."
42:15;42:17;"- Unbelievable."
42:17;42:19;"Actually, I want to play some of the music."
42:19;42:20;"'Cause I haven't heard any of this."
42:20;42:21;"- Well, the record's out."
42:21;42:22;"- Well, no, no, just the singles."
42:22;42:23;"- Sorry."
42:23;42:24;"- So this is the single you were referencing before,"

43:32;43:33;"I feel like his last few records"
43:33;43:35;"were like medieval Christmas albums and (beep)"
43:35;43:38;"- Yeah, no, it's definitely fun."
43:38;43:39;"I think it's really fun."
43:39;43:41;"- But so you said when you saw them with Guy Fieri"
43:41;43:43;"that it seemed designed to go viral."
43:43;43:45;"So by that, do you mean that you could tell"
43:45;43:47;"that their attitude towards this project was,"
43:47;43:49;"not that the music is not serious,"
43:49;43:51;"but that from the beginning of it,"
43:51;43:54;"they were having fun, not taking themselves too seriously?"
43:54;43:55;"- Yeah."
43:55;43:55;"- 'Cause I feel like-- - Definitely."
43:55;43:57;"- You look at old footage of like the police"
43:57;43:58;"doing interviews and it's so tense"
43:58;44:00;"and everybody's so serious."
44:00;44:01;"And yeah, you feel like Sting"
44:01;44:03;"wouldn't have been taking a picture with Guy Fieri"
44:03;44:04;"in like the mid 80s, the equivalent."
44:04;44:05;"- No, it's like, you know,"
44:05;44:07;"Sting hasn't been in a band for 30 years."
44:07;44:10;"He probably hasn't done press with another person"
44:10;44:12;"for Days on End in forever."
44:12;44:14;"And you can tell he really, really enjoys"
44:14;44:15;"doing these interviews with Shaggy."
44:15;44:18;"They are truly delightful."
44:18;44:19;"- Well, actually, since you're talking about so much,"
44:19;44:20;"it makes me wanna see them."
44:20;44:23;"Is there one that we could go to maybe?"
44:23;44:25;"- The thing is a lot of them kind of all start"
44:25;44:28;"in the same place of how they started their collaboration."
44:28;44:30;"And then the like fun stuff comes later."
44:30;44:31;"So I've probably watched like three or four hours"
44:31;44:33;"of interviews with these guys."
44:33;44:34;"- Yeah."
44:34;44:35;"- That was why like when they sent that message,"
44:35;44:37;"Miki emailed it to me and I like thought"
44:37;44:38;"I was gonna have a heart attack"
44:38;44:40;"'cause I had been watching these guys so much"
44:40;44:42;"and all of a sudden they were talking at me."
44:42;44:43;"It was like pretty trippy."
44:43;44:45;"But this one, they just,"
44:45;44:48;"I guess it's with the popular website, Ladbible."
44:48;44:50;"It's a little more like free association."
44:50;44:51;"I thought this one was cool."
44:51;44:53;"I posted a little segment from this,"
44:53;44:54;"but I'll just, I'll play it."
44:54;44:55;"- You can't say it wasn't me,"
44:55;44:57;"especially with the milk mustache."
44:57;44:59;"(laughing)"
44:59;45:01;"- Wasn't me."
45:01;45:03;"- But you got a milk mustache, bro."
45:06;45:07;"- Hi, I'm Sting."
45:07;45:08;"- And I'm Shaggy."
45:08;45:10;"And we are here to give you some life advice."
45:10;45:11;"- Shut up."
45:11;45:12;"- Sure."
45:12;45:13;"- Timing."
45:13;45:14;"- All right."
45:14;45:17;"I need an epic icebreaker to ask the girl I fancy"
45:17;45:20;"on a date, Drew from London."
45:20;45:23;"Oh, you must be tired 'cause you've been running"
45:23;45:25;"around my mind all day."
45:25;45:26;"- That's pretty good."
45:26;45:27;"Of course that's pretty good."
45:27;45:28;"Did that work?"
45:28;45:29;"- This is Lexi from Bromley."
45:29;45:31;"My girlfriend caught me red-handed creeping"
45:31;45:32;"with the girl next door."
45:32;45:35;"(laughing)"
45:35;45:38;"What should I do as she isn't answering my calls anymore?"
45:38;45:39;"It's sad."
45:39;45:43;"It's tragic, actually."
45:43;45:44;"Go around with some flowers."
45:44;45:45;"Maybe that will cost you money."
45:45;45:46;"- Wow."
45:46;45:48;"- I haven't seen this side of Sting in a long time."
45:48;45:49;"- Yeah, that's great."
45:49;45:51;"- Maybe just because the last time I can really picture"
45:51;45:53;"Sting doing press is like watching a documentary"
45:53;45:55;"about the police and him in the 80s."
45:55;45:57;"It's also like a reminder of how much"
45:57;45:59;"the media landscape has changed."
45:59;46:02;"Yeah, just like Sting doing like a lad Bible interview,"
46:02;46:04;"kind of giving advice on like, you know,"
46:04;46:07;"my flatmate is like stealing from me or something."
46:07;46:10;"'Cause when Sting came up, that was like the superstar era."
46:10;46:12;"Like these kind of godlike people."
46:12;46:15;"Whereas now, we wanna see people just be real."
46:15;46:17;"- I saw today that they booked"
46:17;46:19;"the Queen's 92nd birthday party"
46:19;46:21;"the day after their album drops on April 21st."
46:21;46:23;"- Right, right, yeah, we heard about that."
46:23;46:25;"So they will be performing for the Queen?"
46:25;46:26;"- Yeah, I think so."
46:26;46:28;"- For the whole royal family."
46:28;46:30;"Actually, we have an article about it."
46:30;46:32;"- Are there other bands on the bill or is it just them?"
46:32;46:33;"- Yeah, but for her 92nd birthday,"
46:33;46:36;"Queen Elizabeth II will receive Sting and Shaggy."
46:36;46:38;"The duo are a monk performer slated"
46:38;46:39;"for Her Majesty's Birthday concert"
46:39;46:42;"at London's Royal Albert Hall on April 21st,"
46:42;46:46;"a day after they released their joint album, 44/876."
46:46;46:47;"Is that like an area codes?"
46:47;46:48;"- Country code. - Country code."
46:48;46:50;"- England, Jamaica. - Oh, wow."
46:50;46:51;"Yeah, they're not alone."
46:51;46:54;"Also gonna have Kylie Minogue, Craig David, Tom Jones,"
46:54;46:57;"and Lady Smith Black Mambazo."
46:57;46:58;"I'm also just curious about what does this mean,"
46:58;47:00;"the Queen's 92nd birthday?"
47:00;47:03;"Did they actually consult the Queen and say,"
47:03;47:05;"""Are there any records you're psyched for this year?"""
47:05;47:08;"And she's like, ""I heard about that Sting-Shaggy collab."""
47:08;47:09;"- She must be."

47:49;47:51;"- So actually, I'm glad that you're here for this one, Chris,"
47:51;47:55;"because Cynthia Nixon is running for governor in New York."
47:55;47:56;"- Oh yeah."
47:56;47:59;"- Are you a Sex and the City head, an SATC head?"
47:59;48:00;"- Yeah, definitely."
48:00;48:02;"I've seen every episode on both movies."
48:02;48:05;"The second movie is truly a challenging watch."
48:05;48:06;"- An abomination?"
48:06;48:07;"- It's a challenging watch."
48:07;48:09;"- That's the one where they're in the Middle East?"
48:09;48:10;"- Yeah, and it has an aged one."
48:10;48:11;"- I saw that one."
48:11;48:12;"- Oh, you saw that one?"
48:12;48:13;"Yeah, yeah."
48:13;48:13;"- Yeah, on a plane."
48:13;48:15;"- Yeah, oh, I remember that, actually."
48:15;48:16;"I, this is so stupid."
48:16;48:19;"When I got deferred from Columbia when I applied there,"
48:19;48:22;"I was like really dark in a really bad place."
48:22;48:23;"- Damn."
48:23;48:25;"- And then the way I got out of my sad place"
48:25;48:27;"was by binging on Sex and the City."
48:27;48:28;"- Whoa."
48:28;48:29;"- It's really bingeable."
48:29;48:29;"- So you were like a senior in high school."
48:29;48:31;"- That got you out of a sad place?"
48:31;48:33;"- Absolutely, I love that."
48:33;48:35;"I mean, it's a really good show."
48:35;48:38;"But yeah, so, and my mom had bought the DVDs,"
48:38;48:38;"so they were in the basement."
48:38;48:40;"- Oh, this is before the streaming era."
48:40;48:41;"- Oh yeah, definitely."
48:41;48:44;"So I've tried these DVDs out and I really enjoyed it."
48:44;48:46;"- Jake, have you ever seen SATC?"
48:46;48:47;"- Oh yeah."
48:47;48:48;"- Oh, really?"
48:48;48:48;"Are you an SATC head?"
48:48;48:49;"- No, not a head."
48:49;48:50;"- But you respect it?"
48:50;48:51;"- Yeah."
48:51;48:53;"- Do you know the names of the four characters?"
48:53;48:54;"- Samantha."
48:54;48:57;"Wait, is that the Carrie?"
48:57;48:58;"No, no, no, Carrie?"
48:58;48:59;"Wait, is that the Carrie?"
48:59;49:00;"Yeah, you're good, you can keep going."
49:00;49:01;"- Carrie?"
49:01;49:03;"And then there's Cynthia Nixon's character"
49:03;49:05;"was named like Margaret?"
49:05;49:06;"- Miranda."
49:06;49:07;"- Miranda. - Red letter."
49:07;49:09;"- And then there was the woman with the brown hair"
49:09;49:11;"who was like kind of the least interesting character."
49:11;49:12;"- Debatable."
49:12;49:13;"- I don't remember her."
49:13;49:14;"Wait."
49:14;49:15;"- The actress is-"
49:15;49:16;"- Phoebe?"
49:16;49:17;"No."
49:17;49:18;"(laughing)"
49:18;49:18;"- Charlotte."
49:18;49:19;"- Charlotte."
49:20;49:22;"- Played wonderfully by Kristen Davis in my opinion."
49:22;49:23;"- Okay."
49:23;49:24;"- Is that-"
49:24;49:25;"- I'm not bagging on the actress."
49:25;49:26;"I just assume that character-"
49:26;49:28;"(laughing)"
49:28;49:30;"- I think you were bagging on the actress."
49:30;49:32;"- I feel like the writing really fell short for that."
49:32;49:34;"But here's the thing, I'm not ahead."
49:34;49:35;"I don't know the full arc."
49:35;49:37;"- Well, Baio, in the fan community,"
49:37;49:39;"(laughing)"
49:39;49:42;"is Charlotte considered to be the boring one?"
49:42;49:45;"- I think arguably the four characters"
49:45;49:47;"all had such strong arcs that different people"
49:47;49:49;"could identify with different ones."
49:49;49:50;"- Okay."
49:50;49:51;"- Wow."
49:51;49:52;"- They're like the Beatles."
49:52;49:53;"- Definitely."
49:53;49:53;"- Everybody got a favorite."
49:53;49:55;"- But Charlotte is like the Ringo."
49:55;49:56;"(laughing)"
49:56;49:57;"Damn."
49:57;49:58;"- He got his knighthood in the end."
49:58;49:59;"(laughing)"
49:59;50:03;"- Well, so for all the TC news heads"
50:03;50:05;"who get their news from Time Crisis,"
50:05;50:06;"like a week or two ago,"
50:06;50:08;"it was announced that the actress Cynthia Nixon,"
50:08;50:12;"who played Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City,"
50:12;50:13;"which is her best known role,"
50:13;50:14;"certainly not her only role,"
50:14;50:16;"is running for governor."
50:16;50:18;"In the fan community, what's Cynthia Nixon's deal?"
50:18;50:19;"And I'm sure it gets confusing"
50:19;50:23;"because people can't sometimes like combine the person"
50:23;50:24;"and the characters a lot."
50:24;50:27;"- Yeah, I hesitate to speak for the fan community"
50:27;50:30;"because I feel like my interactions with it"
50:30;50:31;"were very much kind of in a bubble."
50:31;50:34;"I didn't necessarily read message boards and stuff."
50:34;50:36;"I'm not active in the fan community."
50:36;50:39;"I have a very kind of personal relationship with the show."
50:39;50:42;"But as that article you have says,"
50:42;50:44;"I think she's been very politically active for a long time."
50:44;50:45;"- Right, this article says Cynthia Nixon"
50:45;50:47;"isn't new to politics."
50:47;50:49;"Because I'll admit I had the reaction,"
50:49;50:50;"a lot of people are like,"
50:50;50:52;"""Oh, another celebrity politician."
50:52;50:54;"""Don't we need to kind of pump the brakes?"""
50:54;50:56;"- No, but I think she's done her time."
50:56;51:00;"- Well, her campaign treasure is Zephyr Teachout."
51:00;51:01;"I've always wondered if that's how you pronounce that name."
51:01;51:05;"Zephyr Teachout or Teach-u."
51:05;51:06;"- It's a cool name."
51:06;51:08;"- A progressive working families party candidate"
51:08;51:11;"who challenged Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic primary."
51:11;51:15;"So she's got some real political people on her team."
51:15;51:16;"- That's nice actually."
51:16;51:18;"I would always vote working families"
51:18;51:20;"when I voted in local elections."
51:20;51:23;"- Yeah, they're like, if somebody's got the Democrats"
51:23;51:25;"and the working families behind them,"
51:25;51:29;"reason to hope that they're a little more to the left."
51:29;51:31;"So Cynthia Nixon's a lifelong resident in New York."
51:31;51:32;"She grew up in Manhattan, attended public schools,"
51:32;51:34;"and sent her children to public schools."
51:34;51:38;"Okay, that's not a lot of big name celebs"
51:38;51:41;"sending their kids to public schools in New York."
51:41;51:42;"I'm not trying to throw under the bus,"
51:42;51:45;"but did Sarah Jessica Parker send her kids to public school?"
51:45;51:47;"Doubt it."
51:47;51:48;"Maybe she did, I don't know."
51:48;51:51;"The only question that I have is,"
51:51;51:53;"why do you start at governor?"
51:53;51:55;"Isn't that like a high level to start at,"
51:55;51:56;"or is that exactly what we need?"
51:56;52:00;"'Cause she's no stranger to politics,"
52:00;52:03;"but this would be her first time seeking office."
52:03;52:05;"- Maybe because she already has the name recognition."
52:05;52:06;"- Yeah, maybe it's not about--"
52:06;52:08;"- It's like, if you're not a famous person,"
52:08;52:11;"you have to start running for city council"
52:11;52:12;"and chip your way up."
52:12;52:13;"- Right."
52:13;52:14;"- If you're already famous, it's like--"
52:14;52:17;"- I think she's also being strategically intelligent"
52:17;52:21;"because I think Governor Cuomo has a lot of vulnerabilities"
52:21;52:22;"in terms of the MTA."
52:22;52:26;"She's a New York City resident riding the subway every day."
52:26;52:30;"She can sort of channel the frustrations people have"
52:30;52:34;"that Cuomo maybe doesn't experience being up in Albany."
52:34;52:36;"- Right, but New York's a big ass state."
52:36;52:38;"You got a lot of the population down in the city,"
52:38;52:43;"but Cynthia Nixon, she better pack a fleece"
52:43;52:46;"when she's getting up there to Buffalo."
52:46;52:48;"- Thermos of hot coffee."
52:48;52:49;"- Syracuse."
52:49;52:49;"- Schenectady."
52:51;52:52;"It's the wild west up there."
52:52;52:54;"- Does she have a shot?"
52:54;52:55;"I haven't seen any polls."
52:55;52:56;"My gut tells me she has a shot."
52:56;52:59;"- But Cuomo's not popular."
52:59;53:00;"And so, I'm asking."
53:00;53:01;"- No, I think she has a shot."
53:01;53:02;"- I don't know anything about--"
53:02;53:04;"- People are talking about her as if she has a shot."
53:04;53:07;"- But it would be like New York City liberals"
53:07;53:08;"getting behind her."
53:08;53:10;"- She'd be running to the left of Cuomo, definitely."
53:10;53:11;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:11;53:14;"And so, but like, if you're like a primary voter"
53:14;53:17;"in like upstate New York, maybe you're really liberal,"
53:17;53:18;"but maybe you're more centrist or something."
53:18;53:19;"I don't know."
53:19;53:20;"- Yes."
53:20;53:21;"- But I think, yeah, likely,"
53:21;53:22;"she's gonna have to jump in the car,"
53:22;53:24;"drive six and a half hours up there,"
53:24;53:26;"and you know, really put in the work."
53:26;53:27;"But maybe she can."
53:27;53:29;"Also, you know, New York is famously"
53:29;53:31;"run by political machines."
53:31;53:33;"The Democratic Party, the Republican parties of New York"
53:33;53:35;"are like tough to infiltrate."
53:35;53:38;"So, she would have as her work could offer, but why not?"
53:38;53:42;"- Can I ask, without President Donald Trump,"
53:42;53:44;"is there a Governor Cynthia Nixon?"
53:44;53:47;"Did he normalize the celebrity as politician?"
53:47;53:50;"- Well, there was already Governor Jesse Ventura."
53:50;53:50;"- True."
53:50;53:51;"- The Governator as well?"
53:51;53:53;"- Yeah, the Governator."
53:53;53:54;"- It's a good question, Seinfeld."
53:54;53:55;"- It's a good question, Seinfeld."
53:55;53:57;"I've got a question for you, Seinfeld."
53:57;54:00;"Have you ever done a Sex and the City meets Seinfeld meme?"
54:00;54:04;"They're both four main cast members in New York."
54:04;54:07;"The shows, they both are associated with the '90s,"
54:07;54:09;"albeit different parts of the '90s."
54:09;54:10;"- Have you seen the Sarah Jessica,"
54:10;54:12;"the Carrie behind her laptop thing?"
54:12;54:14;"You know, and I wondered,"
54:14;54:16;"I think I jumped on one of those a couple of years ago."
54:16;54:18;"I can't remember what the joke was."
54:18;54:20;"It was probably had to do with Seinfeld"
54:20;54:22;"being on television or whatever."
54:22;54:24;"That's probably the extent of it."
54:24;54:26;"- That would be cool if they,"
54:26;54:27;"I mean, these are all different companies,"
54:27;54:30;"but you know how Marvel's done such a great job"
54:30;54:32;"of building the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
54:32;54:33;"- Yeah, yep."
54:33;54:34;"- You heard about this, Jake?"
54:34;54:36;"(all laughing)"
54:36;54:39;"If I see what the MCU was, would you?"
54:39;54:40;"- I'd struggle with that."
54:40;54:43;"- Michigan Central University."
54:43;54:45;"There probably are a bunch of different MCs,"
54:45;54:47;"but they've done a great job to the point"
54:47;54:50;"that the forthcoming Avengers Infinity War film,"
54:50;54:53;"I think it might be the most expensive movie ever made."
54:53;54:54;"- Infinity War?"
54:54;54:55;"- Yeah."
54:55;54:57;"- That's the worst sounding thing ever."
54:57;54:58;"- What?"
54:58;55:00;"Hey, what's your problem with that?"
55:00;55:02;"- This is a terrible combination of words."
55:02;55:05;"I want nothing to do with Infinity War."
55:05;55:07;"- I'm with you."
55:07;55:11;"- Okay, but my point is that over the past 10, 15 years,"
55:11;55:13;"you know, we didn't really have superhero movies"
55:13;55:15;"of this nature back in the day."
55:15;55:16;"And over the past 10, 15 years,"
55:16;55:19;"Marvel has built up the MCU to the point"
55:19;55:21;"that this forthcoming Avengers Infinity War,"
55:21;55:25;"if you look at the poster, we got Black Panther,"
55:25;55:27;"the Hulk, Jake's yawning."
55:27;55:28;"He does not care about this."
55:28;55:29;"We got fricking Thor."
55:29;55:32;"- Wait, oh, but Hawkeye was left off, right?"
55:32;55:33;"- Oh, why?"
55:33;55:34;"- I don't know."
55:34;55:35;"- Nobody knows why."
55:35;55:37;"- The Hawkeye heads are upset."
55:37;55:39;"- But this is, it's all been building up to this moment"
55:39;55:42;"because they've built out the MCU and people are excited."
55:42;55:45;"And finally, there's gonna be a huge movie"
55:45;55:50;"where you're gonna see Thor hanging out in Wakanda."
55:50;55:52;"Apparently you're not gonna have a Hawkeye,"
55:52;55:56;"but you're gonna have, what are the other big ones?"
55:56;55:57;"You're gonna have-"
55:57;55:58;"- What about the Punisher, man?"
55:58;56:01;"- You can have the Punisher murdering Iron Man."
56:01;56:03;"You know, that's really exciting for people."
56:03;56:04;"So anyway."
56:04;56:05;"- I'm pumped."
56:05;56:07;"- Wouldn't it be cool if there was a New York"
56:07;56:11;"cinematic universe and we do like a New York Infinity War"
56:11;56:15;"and you got Jerry, Elaine, Cram."
56:15;56:15;"- I love this."
56:15;56:18;"- Phoebe, Rachel, Chandler."
56:18;56:19;"- No, no, no."
56:19;56:21;"(laughing)"
56:21;56:23;"- Well, no, but you could write it."
56:23;56:24;"- Oh, okay."
56:24;56:25;"- Oh, nice."
56:25;56:26;"- Actually, I'll propose this."
56:26;56:27;"- All right."
56:27;56:31;"- We do a time crisis, like Russian novels,"
56:31;56:33;"(laughing)"
56:33;56:35;"1200 pages fan fiction."
56:35;56:36;"- Wow."
56:36;56:40;"- And you can get your just desserts that are,"
56:40;56:41;"I know I'm misusing that phrase."
56:41;56:43;"(laughing)"
56:43;56:45;"You can have your cake and eat it too"
56:45;56:47;"because you can write out, you know,"
56:47;56:49;"it's like Les Miserables basically."
56:49;56:51;"And like towards the end, there's like a huge battle."
56:51;56:54;"And yeah, like finally Kramer and Chandler,"
56:54;56:56;"like this is really what it would be"
56:56;56:57;"if this is Avengers Infinity War."
56:57;57:00;"In like the trailer, it would just be Kramer and Chandler"
57:00;57:03;"coming like nose to nose, facing each other"
57:03;57:06;"in like the ruins of like the Empire State Building."
57:06;57:07;"And just like the fans are like,"
57:07;57:09;"""Oh, that's gonna be a sick fight."""
57:09;57:11;"- You got George dating Monica."
57:11;57:12;"(laughing)"
57:12;57:14;"- I love this idea."
57:14;57:16;"Like I earnestly love it and I want Frazier to be in it."
57:16;57:18;"I know he's a Seattle guy, but I want Frazier in the mix."
57:18;57:19;"- Well, he pops in for the weekend."
57:19;57:20;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:20;57:21;"- I guess in some ways,"
57:21;57:24;"it's not even the New York cinematic universe."
57:24;57:27;"It's really just the 90s TV cinematic universe."
57:27;57:28;"- Oh yeah."
57:28;57:30;"Get Caroline and the City in there, get Roseanne."
57:30;57:34;"- That could be a cool B story."
57:34;57:35;"- Yeah."
57:35;57:38;"- Is that George Costanza and Charlotte"
57:38;57:42;"have to travel to Seattle to convince Dr. Frazier Crane"
57:42;57:46;"to come help in the Infinity War."
57:46;57:49;"- Frazier Crane, who was a beast in X-Men."
57:49;57:51;"- Wait, and you know that Kelsey Grammer"
57:51;57:53;"sings the Frazier theme song?"
57:53;57:54;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
57:54;57:55;"- I just learned that."
57:55;57:56;"- We did an episode on it."
57:56;57:56;"- Oh, you did?"
57:56;57:58;"Oh, sorry, I'm not up to date."
57:58;58:00;"That's very embarrassing."
58:00;58:01;"I'm sorry I'm not up to date."
58:01;58:03;"- He missed episode like 39."
58:03;58:06;"- The tossed salad and scrambled eggs."
58:06;58:07;"- Yeah."
58:07;58:09;"♪ Tossed salad and scrambled eggs ♪"
58:09;58:11;"- Based on the Joni Mitchell song."
58:11;58:12;"- Oh, right."

58:13;58:15;"- Yeah, had a weird connection to Joni Mitchell."
58:15;58:18;"- And actually, Frazier is part of the Cheers universe."
58:18;58:20;"- Oh, yeah, so it all connects."

59:25;59:26;"- Oh yeah, they do crossovers, right?"
59:26;59:29;"- Yeah, step-by-step Urkel."
59:29;59:31;"I think Urkel transported into the step-by-step house."
59:31;59:35;"- Did Perfect Strangers do a crossover with Family Matters?"
59:35;59:37;"- Carl Winslow from Family Matters"
59:37;59:40;"was in Perfect Strangers, if I'm not mistaken."
59:40;59:41;"- Right, whoa."
59:41;59:42;"- And he's in Die Hard."
59:42;59:44;"- And then didn't Lieutenant John McClain"
59:44;59:47;"make an appearance on Family Matters?"
59:47;59:48;"- That episode?"
59:48;59:49;"- Wait."
59:49;59:50;"- Oh no."
59:50;59:53;"- No, but he dated Jennifer Aniston."
59:53;59:53;"- Bruce Willis?"
59:53;59:54;"- Oh yeah, that was weird."
59:54;59:55;"- Right, John McClain did?"
59:55;59:58;"- John McClain dated Rachel, I think, right?"
59:58;59:59;"- Oh, you're right."
59:59;01:00:00;"- Oh, right."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"- Well, Bruce Willis, I don't think it was John McClain."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- No, it was John McClain."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- It's all connected."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"It is all connected."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"- Unbelievable."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- New York City cop."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"(laughing)"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"'90s TV infinity war."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"- Welcome to the party, pal."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"- I love this."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"- The 1400 page, two volume novel."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"It'll come like that Murakami novel"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"in this beautiful box set with two gilded editions."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"- You could throw in some obscure ones,"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"like the single guy, Jonathan Silverman,"
01:00:28;01:00:28;"or whoever that shit is."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"- Oh, I remember that."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- I remember that."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, or like Boston Public"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"was at the show with the-"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- Dude, you're going deep right now."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Too deep, yeah."
01:00:35;01:00:39;"- Maybe Paul Reiser and Jerry have a face off."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- That'd be dope."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"Actually, I think Kramer was in A Mad About You,"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"and I remember being upset about it"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"'cause I hated Mad About You."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"- Oh, Mad About You had crossover with Friends"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"'cause Lisa Kudrow was on both."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"- That's right, the twin sister."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"- This infinity war is writing itself."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- It's crazy."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"- Wait, wasn't there a Mad About You,"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"it was like right when Viagra came out"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"and Paul Reiser took Viagra"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"and then he had to leave the apartment"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"and then he ran into Jerry Seinfeld or something."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- Oh, really?"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"- He was like, ""Oh, it's so good to meet you."""
01:01:05;01:01:07;"And then Jerry's like-"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"- And he's just sporting a huge-"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- Oh, really?"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Yeah, I can see that."
01:01:11;01:01:14;"I might have the characters mixed up."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"- It sounds right."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- Just two, yeah, it makes sense."
01:01:16;01:01:19;"Just two comedians living uptown."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- I kind of feel like there was some animosity though"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"between Reiser and Seinfeld"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"'cause he jumped on that wave, right?"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"I feel like Reiser just rode the coattails of Seinfeld"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"and it was undeserved."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Oh, well, you're a mega fan."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"- Wow."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- Our audience is just tuning out."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- But I have a real question."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Are we legally allowed to write this book"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"using these characters that are the properties"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"of various mega entertainment corporations?"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- You'd have to pre-clear a lot of stuff."
01:01:44;01:01:47;"- I think this is an IP cluster (beep)"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"I think there's no-"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- A lot of red tape."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Wait, but what about parody law?"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"- As I understand it,"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"I think it has to be commentary on each of the shows."
01:01:56;01:02:00;"So if you say, ""Hey, your dad's an IP lawyer, right?"""
01:02:00;01:02:01;"- We'll get him on the case."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- All right, let's get him on the case."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"- All right, so-"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"- Get him on the horn right now."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"(all laughing)"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- He's probably playing why."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- Dad, I really need to talk to you."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Okay, dad, you're familiar"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"with the upcoming Avengers film, ""Infinity War""?"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"What if it was 90s TV shows?"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Okay, I feel like every once in a while"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"we'll get an email from somebody"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"who just happens to work in a field"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"and they're deeply knowledgeable"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"about something that we were talking about."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"So we've got anybody who works in IP law"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"or anything like that,"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"if you can advise us on how to write"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"the 90s ""Infinity War."""
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- I think we're gonna get shut down."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- Well, I just wanna know"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"because I don't wanna put the time in"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"if we're gonna get sued over it."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- We just get a cease and desist letter from NBC."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"(all laughing)"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"- Preemptive."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"- That's the next major time crisis project."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"We also still have to launch our baseball league"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"that's like the professional wrestling baseball league."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"- Right."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"- Not to mention the grape ice cream."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"- Oh yeah."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- All of these ideas will never be touched on again."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"- We have to, we need to do a time crisis."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"- If you have a good idea,"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"then never think about it again."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"(all laughing)"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- No guys, I really mean it about this one."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"I'm very passionate."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"- I'm serious guys."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"- The fans wanna see that Kramer, Chandler, Brawford,"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"one of them is dying."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"(all laughing)"
01:03:15;01:03:15;"- Oh my God."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- It's time for the top five."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Five on iTunes."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Five on iTunes."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"Five on iTunes."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"- This week we're gonna be comparing the top five songs"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"on iTunes to the top five Billboard hits of 1972."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"It's just a great year."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"- Yeah."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"- Europe '72."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"- My buddy Kyle Field was born in '72."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"- It's a major year."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"- Huge year."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"- Right off the jump, a classic."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"The number five song on the Billboard charts"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"this week in 1972."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's a Paul Simon classic."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"- Oh, okay."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"- Oh, I love this song."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"This is cool."
01:06:47;01:06:51;"It's one of the first like white reggae hits in America."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"And the whole backing band is like actual"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"like Jamaican reggae musicians."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- Is this track one on a first solo record?"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"- It's definitely the first solo."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Yeah, maybe it is track one."
01:07:10;01:07:14;"Jimmy Cliff's band, that's who's playing on it."
01:07:17;01:07:25;"So do you know the famous story about the title?"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- No."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"- So the song is called Mother and Child Reunion."
01:07:28;01:07:31;"So one would assume it's about the relationship"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"between a mother and their child"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"reuniting after some bitterness or time apart."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"And actually it's named after a chicken and egg dish"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"that Paul Simon saw on a Chinese restaurant menu."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"- Wow."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- Because often Chinese restaurants have kind of fun names."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- Right."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"- Buddha's delight, things of that nature."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"And there's a dish that was chicken and egg,"
01:07:52;01:07:56;"the mother and child cooked together for you to eat."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"- Mother and child, that is like profoundly poetic."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- Yeah."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"- For a Chinese menu."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"- You never know, if somebody's working back"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"in the kitchen somewhere, they could be a great poet."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Maybe they just don't get a shot."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Instead, Paul Simon comes and takes that poetry"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"and turns it into a hit."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"- He steals Jimmy Cliff's band."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- Yeah."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- He steals the title from the Chinese restaurant."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- What if there was some situation where like"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"the son or the daughter of like the family"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"who runs the Chinese restaurant"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"was actually like an aspiring songwriter?"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- Right."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"- And he was just like, mom, dad, you know,"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I want to be a full-time musician."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"They're like, you're crazy."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"We work so hard to build this business."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"You need to take it over."
01:08:40;01:08:43;"And he's like, but I think in poetic units,"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"I want to write songs."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Like I'm all about language."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"And they're like, okay, you want to be a poet?"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"You can be in charge of the menu."
01:08:49;01:08:52;"You like words so much, you can be in charge of the menu."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"He's like, all right, maybe I will get creative."
01:08:53;01:08:56;"And he's like, all right, mom, what's in this dish?"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"And she's like, it's like we mix up some chicken eggs."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"And he's like, what do you call it?"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"She's like, what do you mean?"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"It's just chicken eggs, you know?"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"And he's like, I'm going to call it mother and child reunion."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"She's like, okay, whatever."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Whatever floats your boat."
01:09:08;01:09:12;"One day, Paul Simon comes in, nervously waiting in the back."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I can't believe Paul Simon's in the restaurant."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"Doesn't get the nerve up to introduce himself."
01:09:16;01:09:19;"One year later, he's listening to the number of the top five"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"songs on the Billboard charts."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"You can't copyright names."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Yeah."
01:09:24;01:09:28;"Especially a title off a menu."
01:09:28;01:09:28;"Yeah."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"I mean, the truth is, it's pretty cool"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"that he wrote this song based off--"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Yeah, I love that."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"--a dish off a menu."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"I wonder what the Jimmy Cliff dudes thought of this song."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Yeah, that's a good question."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"They were like, oh, white boy doing reggae?"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"Or they were like, eh, great melodies."
01:09:44;01:09:44;"Yeah."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Maybe a little of both."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"Paul, how'd you come up with the title?"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"That's a funny story, guys."
01:09:49;01:09:54;"Back home in New York, there's a Chinese restaurant"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"by my apartment."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"And I saw it on the menu."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"OK."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"That was a very tasteful palate type song."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Yeah."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"The number five song right now on iTunes."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Will it be in a similarly tasteful palate?"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Let's find out."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"Probably not."
01:10:11;01:10:15;"Well, define tasteful."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"It's Imagine Dragons with whatever it takes."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Imagine Dragons is--"

01:10:54;01:10:55;"Oh."

01:11:26;01:11:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:26;01:11:28;"I know this song."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"I'm pretty into this."
01:11:30;01:11:34;"It's like Proto Bieber something, no?"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"So Paul Anka's version had already"

01:11:38;01:11:39;"Oh, wow."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"So already in '72, this is him like covering"

01:11:43;01:11:43;"Right."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"Because he was like the clean cut guy."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"And why I love her so."

01:12:10;01:12:14;"But couldn't you almost kind of see like T-Rex covering this?"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Yeah, because they had a kitschy side too."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Yeah, and they had like funny strings."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Right, but the drums would be like tougher."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Yeah, and like the tones would be all like--"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"All right."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"--buzzed out."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"15."

01:20:52;01:20:54;"it's hard to make the sound."

01:21:17;01:21:20;"And it was a big fight in the '90s for his family"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"to get the songwriting credit."

01:23:28;01:23:30;"But I feel like sometimes when you're"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"watching a nature program, you'll"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"see the lion out there hunting."
01:23:35;01:23:37;"And it gets so gnarly, like the picture, like the lion's face"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"covered in blood."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Yeah."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"Lion might hunt a gazelle, an antelope,"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"something of that nature, out on the savanna."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"But then don't they drag it back into like the brush?"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Yeah, maybe."
01:23:47;01:23:48;"That's not the jungle, though."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"It's not the jungle?"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"It's radically different ecosystems."
01:23:51;01:23:54;"Is this time for-- can I get a number crunch on that?"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"You know, what I'm reading about is"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"that lions are referred to as the king of the jungle."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"But Jake is correct."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"They don't actually live in the jungle."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"And there's kind of this long-winded--"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"there's a Guardian article I'm on about like--"
01:24:04;01:24:07;"Thank god the Guardian wrote an article about this."
01:24:07;01:24:10;"Yeah, it has to do with semantics and jungle being"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"a Hindi word that means not an inhabited place."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"And you know, it's going to be boring for me"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"to go through all this."
01:24:16;01:24:17;"I got you."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"But you're on point on this."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"But to everybody listening to TC, which"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"is a major information source-- news, culture, things"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"of that nature-- that's a pretty good actually"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"to have in your arsenal."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"Well, actually, jungle in Hindi means--"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Well, that's a good one, too."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"I actually didn't know that."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"No, but I mean--"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Undeveloped terrain."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"I just mean like that's a good mix of an incredibly common"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"thing that people say."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Lion is the king of the jungle."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Lion lives in the jungle."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"And it's also pretty good actually."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Lions don't live in the jungle."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"If I could just plug the Time Crisis Twitter,"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"if you check us out, I'll link to the article."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"And then you can follow us @TimeCrisis2000."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"@TimeCrisis2000 on Twitter."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"On Twitter."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Very popular account."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"I guess-- you know what?"
01:24:54;01:24:57;"I guess words change meanings, whatever it's"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"what it meant, uninhabited space in Hindi."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"And now we associate it more with like rainforest,"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"a very dense kind of tree."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"And also even, you know, savanna."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"If you're American, when you hear the word savanna,"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"first thing you think of is Savannah, Georgia."
01:25:09;01:25:10;"Also true."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"I'm the king of the savanna."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"King of the savanna doesn't have the same ring to it."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"No."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"King of the plains."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"Or maybe it was as simple as whoever was writing"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"the English language lyrics, they were bound by syllables."
01:25:21;01:25:25;"They had da, da, da, da."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"And they were like, I'm really trying to work in"
01:25:27;01:25:28;"in the savanna."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"It's not-- and then somebody else was like, just put jungle."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Who cares, man?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"Doesn't matter."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"In the savanna."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"REM covered that song."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Oh, I could totally see that."
01:25:38;01:25:41;"Oh, they had their version, The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight."
01:25:41;01:25:41;"Yeah."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Or these two different things."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Well, it says that it-- what?"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"It was a B-side of The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Oh."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Where they actually did The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Can we hear that version?"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"It's a major song."
01:25:50;01:25:54;"(SINGING) In the jungle, the quiet jungle,"
01:25:54;01:25:57;"the lion sleeps tonight."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"So straight up."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Yeah."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"(SINGING) Himba."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Pretty weak."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"I mean, I like REM, but--"
01:26:03;01:26:03;"I like REM."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"--that's pretty weak."
01:26:04;01:26:08;"I wonder what year that is."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"This is from '91?"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"So it's like out of time era."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"I mean, they're having fun."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"It's not an album cut."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I'm going a little country."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Yeah, if we get a little pedal steel in there--"
01:26:19;01:26:20;"Is type going to go for the--"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"Yeah, hell yeah."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"Oh, there is a pedal steel in there."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Yeah, it's straight up country."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"I called that."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"(SINGING) In the village, the quiet village--"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"The drum machine?"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Pretty light."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"(SINGING) --the lion sleeps tonight."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"This feels a little bit like they stopped by Sesame Street."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Right."
01:26:36;01:26:42;"Well, actually, Elmo, lions live in the savanna, you moron."
01:26:42;01:26:45;"(SINGING)"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"Is that Mike Mills?"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"That's not Stipe."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"That's Mike Mills."
01:26:48;01:26:53;"(SINGING)"
01:26:58;01:27:02;"Peter Bux is drunk like, do we have to do this?"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Oh."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Oh, these guys are just horsing around."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"They're just horsing around."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Is that a theremin?"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"That sounds like a trombone."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"They put a lot of time into this, wouldn't you really think?"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"A lot of parts."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Solid four hours."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"That's it, you think?"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"Yeah."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"And then they had the producer put in the brass and everything?"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"Maybe."
01:27:19;01:27:24;"(SINGING)"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"That's not a bad good Stipe."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"It sounds like you're trying to do Blink-182 version."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Yeah, that's way easier."
01:27:29;01:27:34;"(SINGING)"

01:27:38;01:27:41;"(SINGING)"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Oh, yeah, nice harmonies."

01:27:44;01:27:46;"(SINGING)"
01:27:46;01:27:49;"And then the ugliest sound a human voice can make."

01:27:52;01:27:54;"(SINGING)"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"No, I can't do it."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Stipe has a very distinctive voice,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"but it's hard to nail an impression of."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"He's got a lot of different gears."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"(SINGING)"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"That's not bad."

01:28:11;01:28:13;"You know who would have killed that is Elvis."
01:28:13;01:28:17;"Like, Vegas era Elvis would have destroyed that song."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Oh, ""Lions Sleep Tonight""?"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Actually, now we got to check."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Is there an Elvis?"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"If it's not--"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"maybe Vampire Weekend should cover R.E.M."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"I've been starting to think a little."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"We got some shows booked."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Things are bubbling."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Oh, live?"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"Cool."
01:28:31;01:28:32;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"What would you do, man?"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"I mean, you've got some covers."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"I don't know."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"What would be a good R.E.M.?"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"""Man on the Moon""?"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Or is this kind of-- is that too low energy?"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Yeah."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"I mean, honestly, I know the world would rule,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"but you've got to commit those lyrics to memory."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"That's a lot."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"I always liked ""Imitation of Life."""
01:28:48;01:28:49;"I know that's like--"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"That's a great song."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"(SINGING)"
01:28:51;01:28:54;"That sugar cane that tasted good."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"That's Hollywood."
01:28:57;01:29:00;"Come on, come on."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"All right."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"That's such an obscure--"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"I mean--"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"No, I mean, it was on MTV."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"It was on MTV, too, a lot."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"It's a great song, but it's not like a classic."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"But that's cool."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"You could do like a late period R.E.M. cover."
01:29:12;01:29:16;"A classic R.E.M. just like ""Shiny Happy People""?"
01:29:16;01:29:20;"(SINGING)"
01:29:20;01:29:24;"Stand in the place that you live."
01:29:24;01:29:27;"Think about-- all right."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Send an email if there's a--"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"You guys could kill ""Stand."""
01:29:30;01:29:33;"If there's an R.E.M. song you think Vampirican should cover."
01:29:33;01:29:38;"Back to our current day, the number three song on the iTunes"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"chart right now is by Lil Dicky."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"You know who that is, Jake?"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"I don't."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"Lil Dicky is a rapper--"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"I would describe him as a satirical rapper."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"But then he randomly pops up in these kind of credible rap"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"spaces, which kind of confuses me."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Credible rap spaces."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"Because his vibe is that he's kind of like a goofy white guy."
01:29:59;01:30:03;"And his lyrics, he's always rapping about how"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"he's like a dorky white guy."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"And because his name is Lil Dicky,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"he's always talking about how his dick is very small."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Sounds like Hot Carl."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"A little bit."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Are you familiar with Hot Carl?"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Except this guy, Lil Dicky, he's actually very popular,"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"to the point that he's now on the top five."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"And his newest song is called ""Freaky Friday,"""
01:30:21;01:30:22;"featuring Chris Brown."
01:30:22;01:30:26;"And the entire video, it's kind of like a short film that's"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"basically about Lil Dicky and Chris Brown getting"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"in a Freaky Friday scenario in which they swap bodies."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"Wow."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"And Lil Dicky wakes up and he's Chris Brown."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"He's very excited."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"And Chris Brown wakes up and he's Lil Dicky."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"And he doesn't like it."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"But then he also kind of likes people not"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"bothering him on the street."
01:30:41;01:30:45;"So anyway, I guess maybe it's going to be like a pop song."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"But it's like--"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"[MUSIC - LIL DICKY, ""FREAKY FRIDAY""]"
01:30:47;01:30:48;"Lil Dicky."
01:30:48;01:30:53;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Your boy, Bedsheets, did this song."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:30:56;01:30:57;"Ed Sheeran does the cameo."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"Just Chris Brown so sincerely going, Lil Dicky."

01:31:04;01:31:28;"[MUSIC - LIL DICKY, ""FREAKY FRIDAY""]"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"So you understand what's happening?"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Yeah, a little bit."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"I'm not sure who's who here in the narrative of the song."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"So that is--"
01:31:36;01:31:37;"That was Lil Dicky."
01:31:37;01:31:39;"That Lil Dicky woke up in Chris Brown's body."
01:31:39;01:31:40;"Lil Dicky."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Hence, that's Chris Brown's voice."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"So that's Lil Dicky waking up in Chris Brown's body"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"and exploring what it's like to be Chris Brown."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"So Lil Dicky--"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"FaceTime Kanye."
01:31:48;01:31:52;"Now that he's in the body of Chris Brown, a black man,"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"that's why they do this whole thing about the N-word."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"Right."
01:31:55;01:31:56;"OK."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"If you didn't see the video, you'd just be like,"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"what the hell is going on?"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"Yeah, I'm surprised it's in the top five,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"because conceptually, it's kind of weird that it"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"translates into just audio."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"I guess it is a catchy song."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"Well, keep listening."

01:32:18;01:32:22;"So hot as shit, turned into Freaky Friday."
01:32:22;01:32:27;"But we got no choice but to turn this shit sideways."
01:32:27;01:32:31;"I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."

01:32:33;01:32:36;"I'm in Chris Brown's body."

01:32:47;01:32:48;"Man, this is real weak."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"How is [BLEEP] staying perched up on his [BLEEP]"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"like that?"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"Walking down the street, and ain't nobody know my name."
01:32:53;01:32:54;"Ain't no paparazzi flashing pictures."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"This is great."
01:32:55;01:32:58;"Ain't nobody judging 'cause I'm black or my controversial past."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"So this is Chris Brown."
01:33:00;01:33:01;"In Lil Dicky's body."
01:33:01;01:33:02;"Yeah, Chris Brown's singing."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"It's actually Lil Dicky, but--"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"OK, OK, OK."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"I'm so confused."
01:33:07;01:33:09;"All my daughters in school, wait, if I was Chris Brown,"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"where would I be?"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"What would I do?"
01:33:11;01:33:15;"I woke up in Chris Brown's body."
01:33:15;01:33:19;"So hot as shit, turned into Freaky Friday."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Wait a sec."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"I'm so-- this is totally confusing me."
01:33:22;01:33:27;"So Chris Brown is singing, I woke up in Chris Brown's body."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Yes."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"So then how is that the narrative of the song?"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"It should be Lil Dicky singing."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"No, no, no, no, no."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"Because--"
01:33:33;01:33:37;"You look so frustrated."
01:33:37;01:33:40;"You know what's funny is I met one of the producers of this song."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"I was at a party, and he was explaining this in detail to us"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"like three months ago."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"We had a conversation like this."
01:33:45;01:33:49;"He was like, so then, you know, he wakes up, and he's Chris Brown,"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"so he's like saying the N word."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"Is that what Lil Dicky said?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"He's like, yeah, but he's in Chris Brown's body."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"I was like, you can't have him do that."
01:33:55;01:33:56;"That's [BLEEP] up."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"He's like, no, it's OK."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Because at the time, I didn't fully understand."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"I wouldn't be surprised if some people still think it's not OK."
01:34:02;01:34:06;"But Jake, so you understand, it's Freaky Friday."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"You've seen the film."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"You're familiar with the concept of Freaky Friday."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"I've actually never seen the film."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Are you familiar with the concept of Body Swap?"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Sure, sure."
01:34:13;01:34:17;"So in the plot of the song--"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"No, I understand."
01:34:19;01:34:25;"So when Chris Brown sings, it is Chris Brown's body"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"and Lil Dicky's brain."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"OK, so imagine--"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Oh, I see what you're saying."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"I see what you're saying."
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Right."
01:34:31;01:34:36;"So Chris Brown's voice is singing, I can't believe I woke up in Chris Brown's body,"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"but that's Lil Dicky's thought."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"Right."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Right?"
01:34:39;01:34:43;"I made the narrative assumption that it was first person."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Well, it is first person."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"Which is why in a song, it's crazy."
01:34:46;01:34:52;"So the person that's singing it, we're hearing their interior monologue."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"That's what I assumed."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"Right."
01:34:54;01:34:55;"That's not the case."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"In the video, you're actually watching these guys mouth it, so it makes more sense."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"Right."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"It's very--"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"No, no, you're right."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"It's three layers."
01:35:02;01:35:05;"It actually opens up a very kind of postmodern question, which is,"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"in a song, what is the voice we're hearing?"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Are you hearing the interior voice?"
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Because you're right."
01:35:10;01:35:14;"If in the song version, we were hearing the interior voice,"
01:35:14;01:35:18;"the eternal voice of Lil Dicky that stays with him whatever body he's in,"
01:35:18;01:35:21;"then it would make more sense that we were hearing in Lil Dicky's voice."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Yes, that's what I assumed."
01:35:23;01:35:27;"And I was thinking to myself, ""Wow, Lil Dicky actually has a pretty good voice."""
01:35:27;01:35:31;"Because you set it up as like, ""He's this dorky white guy,"""
01:35:31;01:35:34;"and I'm listening to the first verse thinking it's Lil Dicky singing."
01:35:34;01:35:35;"That was the real--"
01:35:35;01:35:36;"But it's actually Chris Brown."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"That was Chris Brown in the studio."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"I get it."
01:35:38;01:35:39;"But you raised a good point, though, because--"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"I'm just sort of like, ""Wow, he's good."""
01:35:41;01:35:46;"But Lil Dicky is not a singer, so would he not be rapping if he was Chris Brown still?"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Well, because--"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"That is true."
01:35:48;01:35:52;"I don't want to give them too much credit, but they do address it because he goes--"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"he's exploring his body, and his life is Chris Brown."
01:35:55;01:35:58;"In the video, he's looking around the house, and he's looking at his body,"
01:35:58;01:36:02;"and there's a part where he goes, ""I can sing so well."""
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Oh, that's fair."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"So it's like he's exploring his voice."
01:36:05;01:36:06;"He's excited."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"""I can sing so well. I can't believe it. I suddenly have this voice."""
01:36:08;01:36:12;"But it does raise the question, singing is not just your vocal cords."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"It's also the neural pathways in your brain."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Lil Dicky wouldn't have access to them."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"He wouldn't have the years of experience that Chris Brown had."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"No."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"He would have his memories."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"He would probably need a few months to kind of--"
01:36:24;01:36:27;"It's like sitting down in a Ferrari, but you don't know how to drive."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"He doesn't know how to drive stick shift."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Yeah."
01:36:29;01:36:30;"A lot of holes in freaky cars."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"I'm also missing this kind of--"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"This is an insane song to hear without watching the video."
01:36:35;01:36:38;"Also, first pass, we're going very granular."
01:36:38;01:36:41;"I didn't know this song existed."
01:36:41;01:36:44;"♪ I can sing so well ♪"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Imagine our song that was like this."
01:36:46;01:36:49;"♪ I woke up in Dick's long-stretched body ♪"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"Except if I was singing, it'd be,"
01:36:51;01:36:55;"♪ I woke up in Ezra's body ♪"
01:36:55;01:36:59;"Oh, it's because it's my interior dialogue through your vocal cords."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"The DC version."
01:37:02;01:37:06;"Seinfeld as a satirist, do you like this song?"
01:37:06;01:37:10;"I have mixed feelings about it because I actually--"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"I appreciate Lil Dicky and I really enjoyed his--"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"Oh, really?"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"I like him. I like that ""Save That Money."""
01:37:15;01:37:16;"I have like a guilty--"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"You know, I enjoy funny rap."
01:37:18;01:37:21;"I like the Lonely Island, you know, Weird Al."
01:37:21;01:37:25;"It's not cool to admit, but I like rap that's funny."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"And I really like his ""Save That Money"" video."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"I don't know if you saw that."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"This is the concept."
01:37:29;01:37:32;"Again, he's very conceptual, but the video is that he's trying to do"
01:37:32;01:37:36;"like a big baller rap video and he's doing everything for free."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"So it opens with him like going door to door in LA"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"trying to get like mansions to shoot in."
01:37:41;01:37:44;"And he borrows a fee, goes to a dealership, and he gets a car,"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"and he's driving it around."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"And I was talking to a friend about this, and he was like,"
01:37:48;01:37:49;"""You know, this is really funny."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"I don't know if I can support the rehabilitation of Chris Brown."""
01:37:52;01:37:53;"Right, yeah."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"And there's a part in the video where Chris Brown, you know,"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"with the soul, I guess, of the little dick inside,"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"he discovers a gun in his own house."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"And it's like, I don't know, I'm a little on the fence about it."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Yeah, why you got to bring guns into it?"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"But then again, will Chris Brown ever be redeemable?"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"It opens up questions that are maybe worth considering."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"But what was the question?"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"I can't believe that."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"This next single will be with R. Kelly."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Right?"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"I thought the Ed Sheeran and Kendall Jenner stuff at the end"
01:38:22;01:38:23;"was pretty funny, though."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"Oh, so Ed comes in."
01:38:24;01:38:27;"Well, then at the end, they break the curse."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"Okay."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"They go back into their bodies, but then there's like this kind of"
01:38:30;01:38:35;"sting ending where then he flips into a few other people's bodies."
01:38:35;01:38:37;"So he's in DJ Khaled's body, then he's in Ed Sheeran's body."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"And when he's Ed Sheeran, he goes like,"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"""I'm in Ed Sheeran's body."
01:38:41;01:38:44;"This isn't as cool as being in Chris Brown's body."""
01:38:44;01:38:46;"And then he's in Kendall Jenner's body, and so on."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"How's Kendall work out for him?"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"Let's play it. Let's see if it's in it."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"I think that's Kendall Jenner actually singing."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:09;01:39:10;"That's funny."
01:39:11;01:39:12;"That's straight up."
01:39:12;01:39:13;"It's like an SNL skit, basically."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Yeah, exactly."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Exactly."
01:39:15;01:39:18;"When you watch the video, you'll understand it's an SNL sketch."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Wow."
01:39:19;01:39:23;"The only thing that I'll say about it is the chorus to me is so funny."
01:39:23;01:39:26;"Because these are like real pop dudes, real writers."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"I love the thing about the earnest delivery of,"
01:39:47;01:39:51;"""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:39:51;01:39:55;"Just like, because the other parts, they know they're being silly and s***."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"And I just love that he very earnestly delivers,"
01:39:58;01:40:02;"""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Just sings it so well."
01:40:04;01:40:08;"And just, also, just that line,"
01:40:08;01:40:13;"""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:13;01:40:16;"You're right, Seinfeld, there's some thorny issues"
01:40:16;01:40:18;"that maybe we'll get into if it stays in the top five."
01:40:18;01:40:21;"But they accomplished something here."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Also, you know what I find that's so funny?"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"Imagine that it actually happened, and you're all like,"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"""Holy s***, I'm in somebody else's body."""
01:40:28;01:40:30;"And then you just look in the mirror and you say,"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:32;01:40:34;"I don't know why I find that."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"That, to me, is the funniest part of the song."
01:40:36;01:40:39;"It's like Freaky Friday is like a fairly common occurrence."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Yeah."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Frequent enough."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"The tone of the song is not, ""Holy s***,"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"everything I understand about science and reality,"""
01:40:47;01:40:52;"it's more just like, ""Oh, I forgot it was Memorial Day."""
01:40:52;01:40:55;"""I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday."""
01:40:55;01:40:57;"Or, yes, the tone is like,"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"""Oh, today's Valentine's Day, I can't believe it."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"I gotta go buy my girlfriend something."""
01:41:02;01:41:05;"This is a very interesting top five in 1972."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"So, so far, we had Paul Simon, Mother and Child Reunion."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"This is an epic top five we're doing right now."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"And we had Donny Osmond and Robert John."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"Number two, the number two song."
01:41:13;01:41:16;"Imagine this, that this was a big hit song in 1972."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"Yeah."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"The epitome of the tasteful palette of the '70s."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Number two song in 1972."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"Nice."
01:41:25;01:41:29;"That's just one of those songs that everybody kind of likes."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"It's a classic, but it's not cheesy."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Hey, Seinfeld, you'll appreciate this."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"Neil Young was the first Canadian to have a number one album"
01:41:46;01:41:50;"with Harvest in April '72 on the Billboard 200."
01:41:50;01:41:53;"Oh, wow. That's surprising."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"I mean, what Canadians were popping before Neil?"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"- Joanie? - Joanie."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"But was that pre-Neil?"
01:41:58;01:42:01;"Yeah, well, yeah, the blue was '71."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"Oh, what about Paul Anka, who we referenced?"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"He's not-- he's not Canadian, is he?"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"I feel like we've had this conversation before."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"About Paul Anka being Canadian?"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"I think he's Lebanese-American."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"He's a Canadian-American, according to Wikipedia."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"He was born-- yeah, he was born in Ottawa, Ontario."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"To Lebanese immigrant parents?"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"Uh, sure."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"Yeah, all right, but he probably wouldn't have had a number one album."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Yeah."
01:42:41;01:42:44;"I guess one thing we could just say is, like, this is a classic song,"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"everybody knows it."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"What's it really about, Jake? What's your interpretation?"
01:42:47;01:42:50;"I've never thought about it, really."
01:42:50;01:42:53;"I've been a miner for a heart of gold."
01:42:57;01:43:03;"I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"What a cool voice."
01:43:04;01:43:09;"I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold."
01:43:09;01:43:14;"I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"that keeps me searching for a heart of gold."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"He's just looking for a good person?"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"He's just looking for somebody he could trust?"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Yeah, maybe."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"He feels like a miner, except he's not mining for real gold,"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"he's mining for a heart of gold."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"I like it."
01:43:41;01:43:47;"The number two song, back in 2018, B.B. Rexha featuring FGL."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"Oh my God."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"This song won't die, man."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"I don't know if you guys follow B.B. on Twitter."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"I don't."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"She's been catching some flack."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"Oh, really?"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"For doing a country song, and she's been defending herself."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"Who's given her flack?"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Just fans."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"Country fans?"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Country fans."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Oh."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"That's a whack vibe."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"Yeah."
01:44:07;01:44:09;"If this is what counts as a country song,"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"then everybody's just got to chill."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"I can't believe it's drinking Friday."
01:44:34;01:44:37;"I get the impression this was a bigger song than they expected it was going to be."
01:44:37;01:44:38;"Oh yeah, massive."
01:44:58;01:45:02;"Jake, your hold up girl is very popular on Twitter."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"What do you mean?"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"I don't know."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"You did hold up girl last time, but it's a thing now."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"Hold up girl."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Hold up."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Yeah."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Wait, because the guy sings it."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"People took a clip from the show?"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"I don't know."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"The guy sings it in the song?"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"People were quoting you and stuff."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"That's hilarious."
01:45:19;01:45:23;"That's so hilarious to listen to this pop trap country song and be like,"
01:45:23;01:45:27;"""How dare you try to sing country, Ms. Rexha?"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"How dare you?"""
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Pop trap country."
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Let's not forget the autotune element."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Pop trap autotune country."
01:45:35;01:45:42;"How dare you steal the 16th note hi-hat patterns of traditional country music,"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Ms. Rexha?"
01:45:44;01:45:48;"The booming 808 bass drums of country music."
01:45:48;01:45:55;"People like Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, they worked and fought to imbue southern music"
01:45:55;01:46:00;"with booming 808 bass drums and program snaps."
01:46:00;01:46:04;"And Ms. Rexha, you New York City girl coming."
01:46:04;01:46:08;"Did Bebe Rexha's fans also give her shit because--"
01:46:08;01:46:11;"Oh, she probably already-- she already lose them all when she made this song."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"No, I think it's cool."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"I think they were standing up for her."
01:46:14;01:46:17;"Did you stand up for your big Bebe Rexha fan?"
01:46:17;01:46:21;"Yeah, well, we're following her on Twitter, the Time Crisis."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Time-- really?"
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Time Crisis 2000."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"We throw a retweet every once in a while."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Oh, nice."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Yeah."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Does she have a show on Apple Music?"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"On Beats 1?"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"I wonder if she knows about Time Crisis."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"She should."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"I don't-- you know."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"Unlikely."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"We could never have her on the show."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"You would melt."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"You'd be a blubbering mess."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"You're too big of a fan."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I don't want to think about what would happen if we did."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Is Bebe Rexha her real name?"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"I'd keep it together."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"I think it is."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Let's see."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"I'd keep it together."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Bebe Rexha."
01:46:50;01:46:54;"Oh, she is Bleta, quote, Bebe Rexha."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Oh, that's-- what kind of name is that?"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"Bleta."
01:46:58;01:46:59;"You'd think I'd know."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"Albanian."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"That's sick."
01:47:01;01:47:04;"I hope I got Albanian and Kosovar heritage these days."
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha, Rita Ora, Action Bronson."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Born in Brooklyn."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"Shout out to people from that area."
01:47:11;01:47:15;"I woke up in a country singer's body."
01:47:15;01:47:22;"This week in 1972, the number two song was ""Heart of Gold,"" and the number one song was this."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Wow."
01:47:24;01:47:28;"So this was just a wave, these kind of like minor key acoustic--"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"That is so funny."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"Because I was assuming the song was just ripping off Neil Young."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"Absolutely."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"What else is there to assume?"
01:47:35;01:47:39;"There were plants and birds and rocks and things."
01:47:39;01:47:42;"There were sand and hills and rivers."
01:47:42;01:47:46;"But it came out the same time as his biggest hit, so--"
01:47:46;01:47:51;"I mean, maybe to some extent it was sort of like the house style of the day."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"But Neil has a pretty distinctive voice, though."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Yeah, they got some shit for it."
01:47:55;01:48:02;"[MUSIC - NEIL YOUNG, ""HEART OF GOLD""]"
01:48:02;01:48:07;"Some radio stations banned it because they believed that horse was slang for heroin."
01:48:07;01:48:08;"OK."
01:48:08;01:48:12;"But then the singer from America said, ""It's not about drugs."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"It's about the things I saw when I was visiting the United States."""
01:48:15;01:48:17;"Because they're like English or something, right?"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"Wait, I thought they're not American."
01:48:19;01:48:25;"I think they're American army brats who grew up in England."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"Whoa."
01:48:26;01:48:33;"So they're growing up in England, basking in the warm tones of SoCal country rock."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"Wow."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"So they have English accents and stuff?"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"I don't know."
01:48:38;01:48:42;"Yeah, all their dads are stationed at a US Air Force base near London."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"And they went to high school in London."
01:48:44;01:48:49;"I mean, I guess it's sort of like if you got the top five from '92."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Yeah."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"It was like Pearl Jam and then Stone Temple Pilots."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"Right, yeah."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"And you'd be like, is Scott Weiland ripping off Eddie Vedder?"
01:48:57;01:48:58;"I don't know."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"Kind of."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Or maybe that's just the wave."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Or that's just kind of the sound of the era."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"That's just the wave."
01:49:04;01:49:08;"I woke up in Neil Young's body."
01:49:08;01:49:13;"I can't believe it's Freaky Friday."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"You know what's cool about Freaky Friday?"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"Lil Dicky and Chris Brown, they could keep making Freaky Fridays."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"They could do historical Freaky Fridays."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"Neil Young and Joni Mitchell have a Freaky Friday."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"Chris Brown and Lil Dicky do Neil Young and Joni Mitchell?"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"Well, I'm just saying they could produce it."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Oh, I see."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"They could do Freaky Fridays throughout history."
01:49:32;01:49:36;"You know, like those guys who used to make the epic rap battles of history?"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"Be like Einstein is rapping against--"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"I don't think I know that."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"Wow."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, that was a big one."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"Yeah, so you could do Freaky Fridays throughout history."
01:49:45;01:49:50;"Napoleon wakes up in the Duke of Wellington's body."
01:49:50;01:49:54;"The number one song back in our era, 2018,"
01:49:54;01:49:57;"Ben Platt and Lin-Manuel Miranda."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"Jake, do you know who those people are?"
01:49:58;01:50:01;"I know who Lin-Manuel Miranda is."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Prove it."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"I don't know who Ben Platt is."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Who is Lin-Manuel Miranda?"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"He wrote Hamilton."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Right."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"Don't forget about In the Heights."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Fake fan."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Oh, never heard of it."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"And I know he was on season 10 of Curb."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"That's right."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"As himself."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"That's right."
01:50:18;01:50:21;"Ben Platt is also a giant of musical theater."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"Okay."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"He's the star of Dear Evan Hansen."
01:50:24;01:50:25;"Have you heard of that?"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"Mm-mm. Have you?"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Yeah, I've heard of it."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"It's a major Broadway musical right now."
01:50:30;01:50:34;"And he won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical."
01:50:34;01:50:39;"This is like Jay-Z and Kanye coming together on Watch the Throne."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"Right."
01:50:40;01:50:44;"It's called Found Tonight, and it's a mashup of two Broadway musical numbers."
01:50:44;01:50:49;"Hamilton's The Story of Tonight, a song you, of course, are familiar with as someone who's seen Hamilton."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"And Dear Evan Hansen's You Will Be Found."
01:50:51;01:50:59;"And this is a benefit single raising money for the survivors of the high school shooting in Florida."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Okay."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"So you can't say anything bad about it."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Nope."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"This is for a good cause."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"What's Dear Evan Hansen about?"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Seinfeld, do you know what Dear Evan Hansen's about?"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"I'm hearing about it for the first time now."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"You've never even heard of it?"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"No."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"Oh, wait, is it the one about bullying or something and the guy--"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"Is it like he writes letters?"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"You know what? I think I do know this actually."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Is that why it's called Dear Evan Hansen?"
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Yeah."
01:51:46;01:51:48;"It's writing letters to a bully?"
01:51:48;01:51:51;"Is this the guy who gets panic attacks or something?"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"It's a bully who gets panic attacks."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Oh, wait. Oh!"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Yeah."
01:51:56;01:52:01;"Evan Hansen is a high school senior who suffers from social anxiety disorder."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"Jesus Christ."
01:52:02;01:52:06;"Which inhibits his ability to connect with other people."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"And?"
01:52:07;01:52:08;"And make friends."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"It's a whole story."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"I mean, he gets over it? He goes on meds? What happens?"
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I'm not going to ruin the musical for people."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"Why didn't Lin-Manuel--"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Like, they could have Freaky Friday'd the shit out of this."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Why didn't they--"
01:52:23;01:52:24;"That's true."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Is that Lin-Man-San?"
01:52:30;01:52:33;"It's Alexander Hamilton."
01:52:33;01:52:38;"I can't believe I woke up in Alexander Hamilton's body."
01:52:38;01:52:44;"I'm just a high school student from the modern era."
01:52:44;01:52:48;"And then Alexander Hamilton wakes up in Dear Evan Hansen's body."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"I can't believe I woke up in Dear Evan Hansen's body."
01:52:55;01:53:02;"I know we'd appreciate this more if we were more familiar with the source material."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Musicals are poppin'."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Musicals might be bigger than movies right now."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"I don't like that."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"Why?"
01:53:08;01:53:10;"I don't like musicals."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"What about what they call jukebox musicals?"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"What's that?"
01:53:13;01:53:18;"That's when they take the catalog of a classic artist, like a Billy Joel or a Queen--"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Oh, like Jersey Boys?"
01:53:20;01:53:23;"Is Jersey Boys considered a jukebox musical?"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"I would say so based on that description."
01:53:25;01:53:28;"But Jersey Boys is telling the story of the group."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"There's even a step beyond, like Jimmy Buffet's about to roll one out,"
01:53:31;01:53:37;"where you use the classic songs of an artist and then you write a story just around it."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"Mamma Mia."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Yeah, like Mamma Mia."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Whose work is that?"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"ABBA."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Oh, really?"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Classic Tom Craze's favorite."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Oh, I didn't know that--"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Like Mamma Mia with Meryl Streep and stuff?"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Mamma Mia, here I go again."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"Oh, I didn't realize."
01:53:50;01:53:53;"Because they do Dancing Queen in it."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"ABBA's perfect for that."
01:53:55;01:54:02;"ABBA has so many incredible songs, so they chose to make a musical in conjunction with the main ABBA people."
01:54:02;01:54:07;"And rather than say, ""Well, let's do a musical about the early days of ABBA and how we got together,"""
01:54:07;01:54:08;"they said, ""No, no, no, f*ck that."
01:54:08;01:54:14;"We're going to do a musical about a girl who's coming to Greece to get married"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"and hang out with her hippie-dippie mom,"
01:54:16;01:54:20;"and then she asks her mom who her real father is and it gets confusing."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"So it's about a wedding and it's in Greece and it's fun."""
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Gotcha."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"Yeah, so that when they sing the songs,"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"they'll sing ""The Winner Takes It All"" at a tender moment."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"""The winner takes it all."""
01:54:30;01:54:33;"Or they'll sing ""Dancing Queen"" where everybody's dancing and trying to cheer up."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"I gotcha."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"So--"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Jukebox musicals."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Yeah, so you could do one for the Eagles."
01:54:38;01:54:42;"So for instance, I'm sure that somebody at some point started developing one."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"So if there was an Eagles jukebox musical,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"and it wouldn't shock me--"
01:54:46;01:54:47;"Desperado."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Literally?"
01:54:48;01:54:53;"It would be like they create a character and his name's like Randy Ortega,"
01:54:53;01:54:56;"just moved to California, sings ""New Kid in Town."""
01:54:56;01:55:01;"There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"Yep."
01:55:02;01:55:06;"And then, you know, at some point he meets a girl and he likes her,"
01:55:06;01:55:10;"but then he goes down to the cafe and he sees her--"
01:55:10;01:55:13;"or no, there's a girl he really likes, but she's married to this sh*tty rich dude."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"But he knows--"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"You can't hide your lying eyes."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"At some point it'd be like Hotel California."
