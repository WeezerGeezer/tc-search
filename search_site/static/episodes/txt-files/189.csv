00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:04;"The hiatus is over."
00:04;00:09;"The boys are back in town, and we got quite a bit to talk about."
00:09;00:17;"Popchips, the cardigans, Mike and the Mechanics, and so much more."
00:17;00:25;"This is the first Time Crisis of 2023, so buckle up and"
00:25;00:27;"grab a beverage"
00:28;00:32;"for Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:34;"Let's begin."
00:44;00:51;"You are a friend warmly of my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy,"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go,"
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different I want you to know."
01:10;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying,"
01:15;01:20;"Leave it only there."
01:20;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. Feeling good. Feeling good. Back in the studio, everybody's here."
01:25;01:33;"It's been a while. I'm gonna refrain. After Jake's two months suspension for"
01:33;01:40;"saying that BTS sucked, I'm trying to think what would Jake get suspended for. Suspended by the"
01:40;01:46;"Apple Corporation or by the Time Crisis corporate board? By the FCC. Oh, okay."
01:46;01:51;"The government which regulates communications. Jake said quote-unquote, ""Not feeling this"
01:51;01:56;"new BTS track. They suck."" Are we talking built to spill or are we talking BTS?"
01:56;02:00;"What are we talking? They weren't sure. They couldn't risk it."
02:00;02:05;"So two months off the air. How's everybody doing? How are you doing, Seinfeld?"
02:05;02:11;"Yeah, I'm good. What's up? What's new? Not much. I missed you guys. Yeah, I missed you too."
02:11;02:18;"What's going on in the online Seinfeld community? Oh, I put out a tweet today. I did one of those"
02:18;02:23;"like one's gotta go, like which one you eliminating from the crew, like from Seinfeld. You know what"
02:23;02:28;"I mean? I put the picture of each cast member. The consensus is Jerry. Really? Yeah, people don't"
02:28;02:33;"want him. I mean, if they had to eliminate one. He's suffering from success. I mean, he is kind"
02:33;02:37;"of like the least interesting character. But then a lot of people are like, you need a straight man."
02:37;02:41;"Like you need the one. He's the glue. He's the apartment. Without him, there's no Kramer."
02:41;02:47;"Yeah, absolutely. Somebody was like, without Jerry's food, Kramer dies. That's right. Straight"
02:47;02:54;"up. I got a real question for you. Real question? That was real. Do you think,"
02:54;02:58;"is Seinfeld getting more popular? Because when I heard that Netflix was going to buy it,"
02:58;03:05;"there was a small part of me that felt like we all love Seinfeld, but is it too weird for Gen Z"
03:05;03:13;"to get into? Here's what I'll say. I've noticed a lot of more international quote tweets on the"
03:13;03:20;"timeline since the Netflix acquisition. So I'll see a lot of South American tweets. I'll see a"
03:20;03:26;"lot of stuff in foreign language. I see a lot of Arabic tweets. So I'm thinking that might be the"
03:26;03:33;"Netflix global effect. But I think to your point, there's also a bit of like Gen Z, the show is"
03:33;03:37;"actually super problematic in all these different ways. So I don't know. It's anecdotally, I could,"
03:37;03:42;"yeah, I can see some international. I feel like maybe it's growing a bit. It's weird when you"
03:42;03:46;"think of the timing. It's like, I think about like when I was a kid, like it would be like being into"
03:46;03:52;"like, I love Lucy or something in a way based on the timeline. So it's kind of, you know, it seems"
03:52;03:58;"like it still has this timeless appeal. Anyway, it's an old weird show. Anyway, Seinfeld, check"
03:58;04:14;"it out. It's streaming on Netflix. What's up with you, Nick? You still watch Seinfeld? Not joking,"
04:14;04:23;"every night. Really? Every single night. When we go to bed, throw on Netflix, one, two episodes. Max"
04:23;04:28;"watches it. We all watch one episode and that sort of gets us. Right. That's your son. Yeah. And how"
04:28;04:34;"old is he? 11. And he gets it? Oh yeah. I mean, we've watched it for a long time. I mean, we got"
04:34;04:40;"a new dog. He was, he got to name it. Dog watches it. Dog watches it. Dog's named Jerry. After Jerry"
04:40;04:48;"Seinfeld. Not Garcia. No. I mean, it sort of cuts both ways, but no, he named it. Let's be honest."
04:48;04:54;"Let's be honest. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But no, we watch it every night and it's, yeah, I mean,"
04:54;05:01;"it holds up in a way where we've seen every episode thousands of times and you will sort"
05:01;05:07;"of dip into seasons and you go, I've seen this one too many times. What I can say, I don't know."
05:07;05:12;"And I had this conversation maybe yesterday is I don't know if television has just gotten so much"
05:12;05:18;"worse or if it has Seinfeld just aged very well. But at the time, if you remember, people really"
05:18;05:23;"did not like the last season, they thought that it had jumped the shark. They thought the ending"
05:23;05:27;"was awful. You know, where they all go to, you know, no spoiler alerts, but where they all go"
05:27;05:33;"to jail at the end. It is so good. I would totally ride for the last season of Seinfeld in a way"
05:33;05:38;"where everybody hates it. But I think in the context of the culture now you go, damn, that"
05:38;05:42;"was good. There's some really classic episodes. Yeah. But people, I will say it's, I don't want"
05:42;05:46;"to Seinfeld probably knows much more than I do, but I don't know. The community does in general,"
05:46;05:53;"does not seem to really get behind the last season. They say, you know, Larry David left,"
05:53;05:57;"but something about it's really just, it hits on all cylinders still. And maybe just"
05:57;06:03;"culture has gotten so insane that that season doesn't feel insane anymore, but I'll watch it"
06:03;06:08;"every night. I think you're both right. I think there are a lot of classic episodes and I think"
06:08;06:13;"it also went into some very surreal territory that the show was very grounded before. And then,"
06:13;06:18;"you know, you've got Kramer, like putting human blood in his oil tank of his car to like keep it"
06:18;06:23;"powered and stuff that just has no like logical application anymore. But yeah, I mean, I don't"
06:23;06:27;"know. There there's a range of perspectives. I think it, I think it holds up and I think it did"
06:27;06:33;"get it better over time. And I also want to say I was in Baltimore last week, charm city. And I"
06:33;06:39;"put on the TV late at night. Seinfeld was on television, linear classic style and it hit"
06:39;06:45;"different. It was so nice to watch. I will say, yeah. And it just happens to be on. There's like"
06:45;06:49;"no better feeling. Right. And then the commercial breaks, you can like send a text or something"
06:49;06:54;"and then you can go to the bathroom. You get a Seinfeld or an impractical jokers on linear TV"
06:54;07:01;"in a hotel room. I mean, impractical jokers. That's whenever I do actually watch regular TV"
07:01;07:06;"and you go to true TV. I'm not kidding. They played 12 hours of impractical jokers a day,"
07:06;07:10;"maybe 24 hours. True TV is the impact. Yeah. It's the impractical jokers network. Do you"
07:10;07:17;"remember when we went to the adult swim up front? I took it to the adult swim up front. I forgot who"
07:17;07:23;"was playing. I don't think it was Jay-Z, but it was years ago and the impractical jokers were there."
07:23;07:28;"Vega. And you, uh, you were so excited and I had never seen impractical jokers. I was a big fan,"
07:28;07:33;"but I couldn't believe it. My wife could, people were pretty surprised that you were like,"
07:33;07:36;"Oh wow. I mean, it's a star studded event. This, uh, adults."
07:36;07:41;"I guess I'm kind of like a indie snob. Cause when I first saw impractical jokers, I was like"
07:41;07:46;"on true TV, like season one or something. I was like, this is basically public access."
07:46;07:51;"And I was like, this is very low production quality, but I felt like I love this for"
07:51;07:56;"lifelong friends. I'm Staten Island. I like their energy. Obviously it's not ready for prime time,"
07:57;08:04;"but, uh, I like four local guys doing something on local TV. Good for them. Then I, I go live my"
08:04;08:10;"life five years later. They're basically Justin Bieber. Like these guys are huge. They're making"
08:10;08:17;"movies. They're paid tens of millions of dollars. They might be billionaires if you put all four of"
08:17;08:22;"them together. And I really felt like, I guess that's how sometimes people feel about music."
08:22;08:25;"You see somebody play a club, you go live your life. Next thing you know, they're playing"
08:25;08:30;"arenas. You feel like where to, A, where did the time go? And B, you get to have that little"
08:30;08:34;"proprietary feeling. Like maybe, maybe it's a bad thing. I want to keep them in their place."
08:34;08:40;"I want them to be living in Staten Island and just be four local guys. I want them to be like a local"
08:40;08:42;"secret for the tri-state area."
08:42;08:52;"You don't know me from the morning, since the old days you've been boring. I gave them what"
08:52;08:58;"they need to keep them laughing. You gave us guilt and fear to make it happen."
08:58;09:10;"Tell us St. Max, you're up the ante, but the music come in handy. You told me that the king"
09:10;09:19;"would never have me. You told me you're sweet, Mary, before you slapped me. But I turned the light on,"
09:19;09:30;"turned the light on, took the shame out of my bread. Come tomorrow, come tomorrow,"
09:30;09:35;"nobody will even know you're dead yet."
09:35;09:43;"Oh, I don't know. Oh, I don't know."
09:43;09:44;"Do you have any idea what we're talking about?"
09:44;09:46;"Heard of the show, never seen it."
09:46;09:48;"Heard of Impractical Jokers?"
09:48;09:50;"Heard of it. Never seen it."
09:50;09:55;"Even just the name, the name is so bad. When you really think about it, Impractical Jokers,"
09:55;10:00;"that it really just had that, that low budget local flavor."
10:00;10:01;"It's a prank show?"
10:01;10:03;"Yes. It's for lifelong."
10:03;10:07;"Is it like a punk? That kind of thing?"
10:07;10:13;"Except that the interesting thing is that it's four lifelong friends from Staten Island. These"
10:13;10:17;"guys literally went to high school together. They're an improv troupe, but they're daring"
10:17;10:22;"each other to do embarrassing things. So they're kind of pranking other people,"
10:22;10:25;"but they're mostly embarrassing each other. Actually, there's four of us."
10:25;10:30;"I mean, like a jackass thing, but not as physical?"
10:30;10:35;"Yeah. It's very not physical. A classic example, it would be that the guy's wearing a little"
10:35;10:39;"earbud and he's getting fed lines and they'll say, ""All right, Sal, you're going to sit down"
10:39;10:45;"in Washington Square Park."" And he's sitting there and they're in a truck or something."
10:45;10:49;"And he's like, ""All right, guys."" And they're like, ""Here's what you're going to do. The next"
10:49;10:55;"guy who walks by, you got to ask him for help. And when he says, 'What's your problem?' You got"
10:55;11:00;"to say, 'My butt hurts.'"" It's something like that. And he's like, ""Oh my God, this is going"
11:00;11:04;"to be so embarrassing."" And they're like, ""But if you get the guy to actually sit down next to you"
11:04;11:09;"and pat you on the back, you win a point."" Okay. Wow."
11:09;11:15;"Yeah. And anyway, this show became an empire. Yeah. I mean, I think there's literally on"
11:15;11:18;"true TV. Have you ever heard of true TV? Heard of it, never seen it. Don't have"
11:18;11:22;"linear cable. No, but there's sort of culture. Within the"
11:23;11:27;"TV landscape, there's two kinds of things that people talk about being pretty crazy."
11:27;11:32;"And one is that true TV is now basically a 24-hour network of impractical jokers."
11:32;11:39;"It keeps the lights on for true. There's almost no other shows. Similarly on MTV2 has become"
11:39;11:41;"the ridiculousness network. Oh yeah."
11:41;11:44;"Where all they show is this show, Ridiculous. Have you ever heard of that?"
11:44;11:45;"No. Oh, Rob Drydak?"
11:45;11:48;"It's on 24 hours a day. I'm out of the loop here."
11:48;11:52;"Yeah. Well, it's very debatable with all this stuff. Are you out of the loop or"
11:52;11:55;"I mean- The channel's out of the loop. It's hard to say."
11:55;11:57;"There's a lot of loops. There's a lot of loops, folks."
11:57;12:02;"A lot of loops. Well, so just so you know, I feel like we've talked about this gentle"
12:02;12:06;"jesters thing for a while. Right. That was our concept was to do-"
12:06;12:08;"Low stakes. Yeah. Even as we discussed it,"
12:08;12:11;"you might not have been aware that it was kind of based on impractical jokers."
12:11;12:18;"Well, I'm familiar with the prank show format. So I understood the whole setup of I'm working"
12:18;12:25;"at a coffee shop. I'm playing Neil Young. Someone walks in, they say, ""Oh, I love this record."""
12:25;12:28;"And I say, ""Yeah, I love Bob Dylan too."" Or something like that."
12:28;12:30;"Right. What was- There was something like that."
12:30;12:35;"It was essentially like that. But it was the same where we're kind of putting you in a situation"
12:35;12:40;"just like the jokers do to each other where you're going to be really embarrassed. And because they"
12:40;12:44;"know each other so well, they can sometimes really embarrass each other. Like one of the guys used"
12:44;12:50;"to be a firefighter. So maybe he loses all the pranks or something. And then at the end, he has"
12:50;12:55;"to do some sort of humiliation ritual because he lost that day's show. And they're saying like,"
12:55;12:59;"""All right, here's the thing. You're going to have to dress up like a ballerina and perform"
12:59;13:03;"swan leg."" And he's like, ""Oh my God."" And they're like, ""Get him on stage."" And then they open the"
13:03;13:08;"curtains and guess what? It's all the guys from the station. All your old firefighter friends."
13:08;13:13;"He's like, ""Oh my God."" Anyway, so because they know each other well, they know what would"
13:13;13:15;"particularly- The pressure points."
13:15;13:21;"Right. So that's why I think you mistaking Neil Young for Bob Dylan would be perfect for gentle"
13:21;13:26;"gestures. I think actually we could pitch this because you bring up Jackass. Someone could say,"
13:26;13:31;"""Now Jackass was big. That's a cultural touchstone."" But then MTV never, they didn't"
13:31;13:36;"really know how to follow that up because the next huge prank show was in Practical Jokers on True"
13:36;13:42;"TV. MTV got their lunch eaten and that's because people wanted to move towards gentleness."
13:42;13:45;"Wait, what about Punk'd? Was that pre-Jackass? That was concurrent."
13:45;13:47;"It was kind of around the same time. What I'm saying is,"
13:47;13:51;"in Practical Jokers took over and it's because people, they don't want all that,"
13:51;13:54;"the violence of Jackass. They wanted something a little more down to earth,"
13:54;14:00;"chilled out. And we can say, ""Let's continue that. Let's go even further. Let's go more gentle than"
14:00;14:06;"in Practical Jokers."" It's like slow TV almost. Just sit back. Nobody gets hurt. No one gets"
14:06;14:13;"humiliated. It's almost not even at this point, not even practical jokes at this point. It's minor"
14:13;14:22;"embarrassment. It's gentle jest. It's just no cuts. Just two hours of Jake at a coffee shop"
14:22;14:28;"that's playing nothing but Neil Young, continually making conversation with people, just saying,"
14:28;14:32;"""Now I love Bob Dylan, but for the life of me, I can't remember which album this is."
14:33;14:37;"Is this '70s Bob?"" And half the people are just like, ""I don't know."""
14:38;14:49;"How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?"
14:49;15:05;"And how many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?"
15:06;15:21;"And how many times must a cannonball fly before they are forever banned?"
15:23;15:36;"The answer, my friend, is flowing in the wind. The answer is flowing in the wind."
15:36;15:45;"I'm on celebritynetworth.com. And Joseph Gatto, apparently he's worth seven-"
15:45;15:46;"Joe. Joe Gatto."
15:46;15:47;"Oh, Joe. Joe. Sorry. Joe for short."
15:47;15:48;"He left, actually."
15:48;15:49;"Oh, he's out?"
15:49;15:50;"Yeah. Maybe he came back."
15:50;15:54;"No, no. He left. And the new season is, and I was going to bring this up, is that they're,"
15:54;15:58;"I don't think they're doing a very good job of it, but where they'll have a celebrity come in"
15:58;16:04;"and take Joe's place. Because they need a fourth Joker. And so Post Malone just did it."
16:04;16:05;"Really?"
16:05;16:08;"Yeah. And so, you know what I'm thinking, Ezra."
16:08;16:09;"Oh, I'd love to try."
16:09;16:11;"Wait, why did Joe leave?"
16:11;16:12;"I don't know."
16:12;16:12;"Do you know?"
16:12;16:15;"I don't think anyone will ever know."
16:15;16:16;"Going solo."
16:16;16:20;"I don't think anyone will ever know. I think that the, my understanding is that"
16:20;16:24;"the Jokers took up too much of his life and it started to impact his marriage."
16:24;16:27;"Not a joke. I think that that is his personal life."
16:27;16:30;"That Joker's text thread was just going off at all hours of the day."
16:30;16:37;"His wife was like, ""Can you just, we're home. We're eating dinner. We're watching Seinfeld."
16:37;16:40;"Can you not text with your boys?"""
16:40;16:43;"Oh my God. I want to get, it's Valentine's Day."
16:43;16:47;"We need a get back style documentary about the impractical Jokers."
16:47;16:51;"The last day of the Jokers. I guess Joe is kind of like the John Lennon."
16:51;16:51;"Joker man."
16:51;16:56;"He's like, ""Baby, I mean, this show's bringing in tens of millions of dollars."
16:56;17:01;"It affords your life, your lavish lifestyle. What am I going to do?"""
17:01;17:08;"They're sitting at a high end resort in Bali, looking out at a beautiful tropical vista,"
17:08;17:13;"wearing diamonds and she's looking so bored and yet he keeps picking up the phone."
17:13;17:15;"Oh dude."
17:15;17:21;"And then she's like, ""It's rude for you."" And this is where it gets tricky."
17:21;17:22;"Babe, we're brainstorming."
17:22;17:27;"It's rude for you to joke with your three lifelong friends from Staten Island."
17:27;17:33;"And Joe's like, ""I would agree with you if we didn't run a business together"
17:33;17:36;"that was built on jokes."" Fair enough."
17:37;17:42;"I would agree with you if this whole vacation to Bali wasn't paid for by us"
17:42;17:43;"four lifelong friends from Staten Island."
17:43;17:45;"I'm working on it."
17:45;17:47;"That would be tricky. Legitimately, that'd be tricky."
17:47;17:49;"And I think that's cool that he's saving his marriage."
17:49;17:51;"Wait, so Seinfeld."
17:51;17:52;"It was a hard decision."
17:52;17:54;"You're on Celebrity Net Worth."
17:54;17:57;"Oh yeah. Which by the way, I don't know how they get these net worths."
17:57;18:00;"Totally. I feel like those net worths aren't the same."
18:00;18:01;"Totally inaccurate."
18:01;18:03;"It feels very concocted. Yeah, so."
18:03;18:05;"I wonder if it was a Jake Longstreth net worth."
18:06;18:07;"Just cue that up for later."
18:07;18:09;"Okay. Seven million."
18:09;18:11;"Seven million? That seems low."
18:11;18:13;"Well, maybe it's real."
18:13;18:15;"I mean, and they're saying they're all worth that."
18:15;18:18;"Each worth seven million?"
18:18;18:19;"Seven each, yeah."
18:19;18:22;"Well, then they got updated because clearly the other guys are worth more than Joe now"
18:22;18:24;"because he's living a quiet life."
18:24;18:26;"That sounds low to me."
18:26;18:30;"I guess we also got, like I said, true TV."
18:30;18:33;"It's possible that the first season of Impractical Jokers,"
18:33;18:36;"they were paying each guy 200 bucks an episode."
18:36;18:39;"Clearly there was a tipping point where they renegotiated."
18:39;18:40;"And the film rights too."
18:40;18:41;"Yeah, they made a movie."
18:41;18:43;"And then also these guys can tour."
18:43;18:44;"They were doing a lot of touring."
18:44;18:44;"Merch."
18:44;18:45;"Yeah, merch."
18:45;18:49;"So I'm on Celebs Age Wiki and there is a Jake Longstreth net worth."
18:49;18:50;"Okay."
18:50;18:56;"We can bleep it out if it's too accurate."
18:56;18:57;"I want to guess it."
18:57;18:59;"It's up to date as of 2022."
18:59;19:02;"Jake Longstreth net worth?"
19:02;19:03;"That's a wide range."
19:03;19:07;"I usually feel like they're way high."
19:07;19:09;"I'm going to say like $3 million."
19:09;19:11;"Oh, yeah, you're right in the middle."
19:11;19:12;"You're worth $1 to $5 million."
19:12;19:14;"$1 to $5 million."
19:14;19:16;"That's a pretty big range."
19:16;19:17;"That's a huge range."
19:17;19:19;"And then there's salary in 2022 is another category."
19:19;19:20;"And it says under review."
19:20;19:24;"They're still chipping away."
19:24;19:27;"Well, I'm self-employed, so I don't draw a salary."
19:27;19:29;"Which website are you on?"
19:29;19:31;"It's called Celebs Age Wiki."
19:31;19:35;"Celebs Age Wiki has three of their top analysts"
19:35;19:41;"working around the clock to review Jake's 2022 income."
19:41;19:42;"Burning the midnight oil."
19:42;19:43;"Yep."
19:43;19:46;"Oh, this is deep."
19:46;19:49;"I mean, there's a wiki component to this where they're talking about"
19:49;19:52;"like all the different means of income that you might have."
19:52;19:53;"And what does it say?"
19:53;19:54;"I mean, it goes in."
19:54;19:57;"It's a time crisis is the first bullet point on there."
19:57;19:59;"It talks about your brother."
20:00;20:01;"Oh, yeah."
20:01;20:02;"Dave, Dave pays me out."
20:02;20:08;"You got something in 2008 called the Pollack-Krasner Foundation Grant."
20:08;20:08;"Is that true?"
20:08;20:09;"Oh, yeah."
20:09;20:11;"That was a one time grant for $12,000."
20:11;20:14;"Well, compounded with interest."
20:14;20:15;"That's like what happened right there."
20:15;20:15;"Yeah."
20:15;20:20;"The 12 grand in '08, like that made my whole year, man."
20:20;20:21;"And you bought paints."
20:21;20:25;"So you put about 10,000 bitcoins."
20:25;20:27;"Back in '08."
20:27;20:27;"That's most of it."
20:28;20:32;"He was supposed to buy paint and he bought bitcoin."
20:32;20:40;"So that's just like some sort of computer like aggregator that's just."
20:40;20:41;"Oh, yeah, it's AI."
20:41;20:42;"There's a lot of..."
20:42;20:42;"Why?"
20:42;20:44;"Like, what is that?"
20:44;20:45;"There's a lot of ads on it."
20:45;20:48;"Has anyone ever looked at that page?"
20:48;20:49;"Are we the first?"
20:49;20:51;"Yeah, I can't see the back end."
20:51;20:52;"I bet we're the first."
20:52;20:56;"I mean, sometimes you come, you see truly the most uninteresting,"
20:57;21:02;"not useful YouTube video and sometimes you just see like 89 views."
21:02;21:07;"And even then you're like, this should be two max."
21:07;21:07;"Right."
21:07;21:09;"And I guess sometimes it's by accident."
21:09;21:13;"But yeah, so I bet something like that probably got 125 views, you know,"
21:13;21:15;"people start snooping around."
21:15;21:16;"But yeah, all these websites are..."
21:16;21:21;"I feel like half the internet is just bots making stuff up now."
21:21;21:25;"Just taking news articles and trying to like repackage it."
21:25;21:28;"Somebody was telling me recently, someone that was kind of dark about,"
21:28;21:31;"they found out that somebody, a friend of a friend had died."
21:31;21:32;"Total tragedy."
21:32;21:35;"And then, you know, like they couldn't reach out to the..."
21:35;21:37;"They were trying to confirm it, but they didn't know who to hit up."
21:37;21:42;"And they Googled it and they said, like, you get all these weird search results."
21:42;21:46;"That's some sort of like bot or AI that's like probably going through death certificates"
21:46;21:47;"and creating weird websites."
21:47;21:52;"Like, how did John Goldstein die on March 25th?"
21:52;21:54;"You know, can't you just like picture it?"
21:54;21:56;"And then it's like, click here for more."
21:56;21:59;"And it's just like, is your testosterone getting low?"
21:59;22:03;"Like, just imagine you're like trying to actually find some like real information about something"
22:03;22:05;"and you're like, what is this website?"
22:05;22:06;"Especially like an older person."
22:06;22:08;"Enter your zip code."
22:08;22:08;"Yeah."
22:08;22:09;"Yeah."
22:09;22:11;"These single women are ready to..."
22:11;22:17;"Yeah, and then you like scroll to the bottom and there's like zero information, actually."
22:17;22:17;"Right."
22:17;22:21;"All this old guy wanted to know is Jake Longstreet's network."
22:21;22:21;"Yeah."
22:21;22:23;"Now he's signed up for..."
22:23;22:28;"I think the impractical jokers are sitting on more money."
22:28;22:30;"You're thinking eight figures."
22:30;22:31;"Yeah."
22:31;22:36;"Well, yeah, I assume these net worths are not accounting for, you know, investments, properties,"
22:36;22:39;"NFTs, like that sort of thing."
22:39;22:43;"It's just based entirely on salary, income."
22:43;22:45;"There's a lot of private stuff that they can't account for."
22:45;22:48;"I make between one and five million dollars a year in time crisis."
22:48;22:50;"Yeah."
22:50;22:50;"Salary."
22:50;22:51;"There you go."
22:51;22:52;"That's my W2."
22:52;22:59;"There's an Apple Music salary cap, which is five million dollars for all hosts."
22:59;23:01;"So yeah, it varies, but within that range."
23:53;23:55;"Anyway, Shep, it's the impractical jokers."
23:55;23:56;"I'd love to have them on."
23:56;23:57;"I got to check it out."
23:57;23:59;"I wonder what you'd think of it."
23:59;24:02;"It's not for everybody, but it's a very casual show."
24:02;24:03;"It's for most people."
24:03;24:04;"It's for most people."
24:04;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:08;"I mean, I don't love, but I like those prank shows."
24:08;24:09;"You have to like the guys."
24:09;24:11;"And I mean, yeah, I could see that."
24:11;24:16;"As a tri-state area guy, I think you might enjoy the concept for lifelong friends."
24:16;24:18;"Their names are, well, there's Joe who's gone."
24:18;24:22;"And then Sal, Murr."
24:22;24:23;"Short for Murray."
24:23;24:24;"Does that sound appealing to you, Jake?"
24:24;24:27;"For lifelong friends from Staten Island, one of them's name is Murray."
24:27;24:28;"And the guy's always like, ""Hey, Murr."
24:28;24:30;"Okay, Murr."""
24:30;24:31;"No, I'm down."
24:31;24:31;"All right, you're sold?"
24:31;24:32;"I'm open to it."
24:32;24:33;"Murr."
24:33;24:33;"Come on, Murr."
24:33;24:36;"If you like that, you'll enjoy it."
24:36;24:38;"So what else has been going on the last couple of months?"
24:38;24:40;"There was a Super Bowl."
24:40;24:41;"Thanks for coming to my Super Bowl party."
24:41;24:42;"It was fun."
24:42;24:43;"Thanks for having us."
24:43;24:43;"Great."
24:43;24:45;"Hell of a spread."
24:45;24:46;"True."
24:46;24:47;"Yeah."
24:47;24:48;"So many wings."
24:48;24:49;"There were a lot of wings."
24:49;24:51;"Chips and guac."
24:51;24:52;"A lot of subs."
24:52;24:57;"One thing that I don't love about throwing an annual Super Bowl party is I miss all the commercials."
24:57;24:59;"You're hosting."
24:59;25:00;"I'm hosting."
25:00;25:03;"I'm looking around, tiny bit stressed."
25:03;25:04;"Is everything okay?"
25:04;25:06;"Were there good commercials?"
25:07;25:10;"Yeah, I caught the Duncan, the Ben Affleck one out of the corner of my eye,"
25:10;25:11;"and I think I ran up to one of you guys."
25:11;25:14;"I was like, ""Hey, Ben Affleck was in a Duncan commercial."""
25:14;25:18;"But it was very like the game was very secondary to the party, I felt."
25:18;25:20;"There was also a lot of children there."
25:20;25:21;"Yeah."
25:21;25:21;"Oh, at the party."
25:21;25:23;"So it'd be like, ""Oh, there's a..."""
25:23;25:24;"Yeah."
25:24;25:26;"At the party, they'd be like, ""Oh, that's the Ben Affleck Duncan ad."""
25:26;25:29;"""Oh, well, my kid just crapped her pants."""
25:29;25:30;"Yeah."
25:30;25:33;"And the kids, they don't know who Ben Affleck is."
25:33;25:34;"They might not even know what Duncan is."
25:34;25:36;"Probably have some idea what a donut is."
25:36;25:39;"But yeah, none of these kids have seen Breaking Bad, for instance."
25:39;25:42;"So the idea of a Breaking Bad reunion, what were they selling?"
25:42;25:43;"Doritos."
25:43;25:45;"Was it though?"
25:45;25:46;"It was a chip."
25:46;25:47;"Pop chips."
25:47;25:48;"Pop chips, yeah."
25:48;25:50;"Not familiar with that product."
25:50;25:50;"Okay."
25:50;25:52;"Actually, I'm glad I brought this up."
25:52;25:54;"What's the deal with pop chips?"
25:54;25:57;"Because I feel pop chips, they've been throwing..."
25:57;25:58;"I feel they're the healthy alternative."
25:58;26:01;"They've been throwing so much money at pop chips for a decade."
26:01;26:04;"I've never seen anybody outside of some sort of like"
26:05;26:07;"sponsored green room situation eating pop chips."
26:07;26:09;"I think JetBlue will have it."
26:09;26:09;"Yeah, yeah."
26:09;26:10;"JetBlue will give you them."
26:10;26:11;"Okay, wait, clarification."
26:11;26:13;"First of all, it was actually Pop Corners,"
26:13;26:16;"which I think is like a competitor to pop chips."
26:16;26:17;"Same idea."
26:17;26:20;"Wait, pop chips got big enough that there's a competitor spending..."
26:20;26:24;"And also to get the two leads from Breaking Bad and by the Super Bowl,"
26:24;26:27;"that's a minimum $20 million investment."
26:27;26:28;"Maybe it's more like 30."
26:28;26:29;"For sure, yeah."
26:29;26:31;"But I think Doritos owns..."
26:31;26:32;"Hang on a second."
26:33;26:33;"Doritos..."
26:33;26:35;"Uh, why?"
26:35;26:37;"It's so weird."
26:37;26:37;"I think Doritos..."
26:37;26:38;"Crunch those..."
26:38;26:39;"You're a little rusty."
26:39;26:40;"I haven't crunched the numbers in a while."
26:40;26:41;"It's been a minute."
26:41;26:43;"Oh, it is Frito-Lay product."
26:43;26:44;"Okay, but just to explain."
26:44;26:45;"Wait, wait."
26:45;26:46;"Explain the commercial to me."
26:46;26:47;"It's like the..."
26:47;26:48;"Jesse and Walter White."
26:48;26:50;"Jesse and Walter are in the trailer."
26:50;26:53;"They're in the trailer cooking up meth."
26:53;26:54;"But now they're cooking up Pop Corners."
26:54;26:56;"And it's the purity, right?"
26:56;26:58;"It's like, ""Oh, we made the perfect Pop Corner,"" or whatever."
26:58;27:00;"And they're just like, ""They went corporate."""
27:02;27:04;"Jesse, remember what I taught you."
27:04;27:07;"""Mr. White, these Pop Corners are gonna be..."""
27:07;27:08;"I can't even remember."
27:08;27:11;"""Suck my d***, Mr. White."
27:11;27:13;"These Pop Corners are gonna be fire."""
27:13;27:15;"This is gripping."
27:15;27:18;"So Pop Corners, it's a triangular chip"
27:18;27:22;"shaped like a Dorito, but it's air infused."
27:22;27:25;"And it's a Frito-Lay product."
27:25;27:27;"And I think what I'm getting confused is that"
27:27;27:29;"there was also a Doritos commercial during the Super Bowl."
27:29;27:31;"And so there were a lot of press releases"
27:31;27:35;"about Doritos, like Frito-Lay having a couple of different spots"
27:35;27:36;"in the Super Bowl."
27:36;27:40;"But I guess there's no real association between the two products."
27:40;27:42;"Where were you seeing these press releases?"
27:42;27:43;"Well, I just looked it up again."
27:43;27:44;"So the thing is, when I looked it up at first,"
27:44;27:47;"whenever it came out, I saw a lot of Doritos talk"
27:47;27:49;"among the Pop Corners."
27:49;27:50;"And then I just looked it up again,"
27:50;27:53;"and there's like a USA Today article"
27:53;27:55;"where it's clearly a rewrite of a press release"
27:55;27:58;"where it's like, ""Doritos and Pop Corners are both..."""
27:58;28:00;"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
28:00;28:02;"Okay, but what about Pop Chips?"
28:02;28:03;"Pop Chips have been out for a while."
28:03;28:06;"I kind of remember like Katy Perry was always selling them."
28:06;28:10;"Pop Chips is an American brand of pop potato and corn products."
28:10;28:13;"Marketing is similar to potato chips."
28:13;28:16;"They are manufactured by processing potato starch"
28:16;28:17;"at high pressure and temperature"
28:17;28:21;"in a process similar to that used for puffed rice cakes."
28:21;28:22;"Okay, right."
28:22;28:25;"That's what gives it that puffy, airy, crunchy vibe."
28:25;28:29;"And Pop Corners is the same thing, same manufacturing process."
28:29;28:30;"It's just..."
28:30;28:32;"Pop Chips just seemed like such a failure to me."
28:32;28:36;"It just seemed like something that they were trying to make happen."
28:36;28:39;"And clearly, they had big celebrity spokespeople."
28:39;28:42;"Did like Pharrell own 25% of it or something?"
28:42;28:43;"God, how did that happen?"
28:43;28:44;"That's amazing."
28:44;28:48;"But Pop Chips is just like massive, using big celebrities,"
28:48;28:50;"and just felt like,"
28:50;28:52;"I don't know anybody who's buying Pop Chips."
28:52;28:53;"Oh, okay."
28:53;28:55;"Investors in Pop Chips, Ashton Kutcher,"
28:55;28:56;"Punk'd Callback here."
28:56;28:57;"There you go."
28:57;28:58;"David Ortiz."
28:59;29:02;"Puff Daddy, Sean Combs, and Jillian Michaels."
29:02;29:03;"So that's probably--"
29:03;29:05;"Wait, is Jillian Michaels our friend from Diet Coke?"
29:05;29:06;"No."
29:06;29:07;"And it's Gillian Jacobs."
29:07;29:07;"Oh, my bad."
29:07;29:08;"Who's Jillian Michaels?"
29:08;29:09;"Jillian Michaels."
29:09;29:11;"Jillian, I think you'd recognize her if you saw her."
29:11;29:13;"She's a personal trainer."
29:13;29:14;"I think she's in reality."
29:14;29:18;"Dude, I love that David Ortiz is an investor."
29:18;29:19;"That rules."
29:19;29:20;"Big Papi."
29:20;29:21;"Yeah."
29:21;29:23;"Puff Daddy and Big Papi."
29:23;29:23;"Ay."
29:23;29:25;"Going in."
29:25;29:26;"Right."
29:26;29:29;"So Jillian Michaels was on The Biggest Loser."
29:29;29:29;"Okay."
29:29;29:31;"Yeah, she's a fitness influencer."
29:31;29:32;"Yeah."
29:32;29:32;"So when did--"
29:32;29:33;"I just want to say--"
29:33;29:35;"But when did Pop Chips drop?"
29:35;29:36;"When did that hit the scene?"
29:36;29:39;"2007."
29:39;29:40;"Oh, it's been around,"
29:40;29:42;"God, it's been around 16 years."
29:42;29:46;"And from an article in Entrepreneur Magazine in 2019,"
29:46;29:46;"the result,"
29:46;29:50;"Pop Chips became a hit snack under Keith Belling's leadership,"
29:50;29:53;"and has sold in more than 30,000 stores,"
29:53;29:56;"and has generated more than $100 million in revenue."
29:57;29:57;"Huge."
29:57;29:59;"That sounds like a fail to me."
29:59;30:01;"Sorry."
30:01;30:02;"Why?"
30:02;30:05;"That's 16 years."
30:05;30:07;"Generated $100 million?"
30:07;30:08;"Don't you think--"
30:08;30:14;"So it's like, yeah, it's like six or $7 million a year in revenue."
30:14;30:16;"How much are they spent on advertising?"
30:16;30:16;"Right."
30:16;30:17;"Oh, yeah."
30:17;30:17;"Well--"
30:17;30:17;"I don't know."
30:17;30:19;"That doesn't sound like a big win for me."
30:19;30:21;"I mean, let's just do the--"
30:21;30:21;"What is that?"
30:21;30:22;"Wait, wait, wait."
30:22;30:22;"What did you say?"
30:22;30:24;"$6 million a year?"
30:24;30:25;"That's off the top of the head."
30:25;30:27;"It's an impractical joke or a year."
30:27;30:30;"To be honest, I think the fact that you've even heard of it makes it successful."
30:30;30:33;"Yeah, it's $6.25 million a year."
30:33;30:34;"OK."
30:34;30:36;"16 years divided by 100 mil."
30:36;30:38;"So the creator of--"
30:38;30:39;"But that's revenue."
30:39;30:40;"Yeah, exactly."
30:40;30:41;"They're spending more than that on ads."
30:41;30:43;"So it's a loss leader."
30:43;30:44;"But they're not doing so much advertising."
30:44;30:45;"I feel like you don't really see it."
30:45;30:47;"They just dropped $30 million on a--"
30:47;30:49;"Keith, that was Pop Corners."
30:49;30:52;"Right, but Doritos probably makes like billions and billions."
30:52;30:53;"Yeah."
30:53;30:56;"Wait, are we talking about Pop Chips or Pop Corners at this point?"
30:56;30:56;"Who cares?"
30:56;30:57;"Pop Corners is new."
30:57;30:59;"Pop Corners is brand new."
30:59;31:00;"Something's off here."
31:00;31:02;"This thing stinks to high hell."
31:02;31:05;"Getting something into the national conversation seems so hard."
31:05;31:07;"Look, here's the article."
31:07;31:08;"But not if you're not selling anything."
31:08;31:13;"The entrepreneur behind Pop Chips hopes to have another hit with rice made from vegetables."
31:13;31:16;"Keith Belling's Right Rice, made of lentils, chickpeas, and peas,"
31:16;31:20;"will be available today nationwide on Amazon and Whole Foods stores."
31:20;31:21;"I've seen that stuff."
31:21;31:22;"I've seen Right Rice."
31:22;31:23;"I've never seen this before."
31:23;31:24;"I've never seen that either."
31:24;31:26;"Are you sure?"
31:26;31:26;"I've seen it, yeah."
31:26;31:27;"Have you had it?"
31:27;31:28;"Never had one."
31:28;31:30;"What am I going to do with that Right Rice?"
31:30;31:36;"It reminds me of when IHOP flipped the P and turned into IHOB."
31:36;31:39;"Were they selling more burgers or pancakes?"
31:39;31:39;"Doubt it."
31:39;31:40;"Doubt it."
31:40;31:41;"You guys remember this?"
31:41;31:47;"Pop Chips received widespread criticism in a 2012 ad campaign where Ashton Kutcher"
31:47;31:51;"pretended to be an Indian man looking for love in a dating ad style spoof."
31:51;31:51;"Do you remember that?"
31:52;31:53;"It was explosive."
31:53;31:56;"And he was like doing an Indian, like a Apu voice?"
31:56;31:57;"He had dark makeup on."
31:57;32:00;"Oh, because it was like curry flavored or something?"
32:00;32:01;"Good question."
32:01;32:02;"No, I don't think it had--"
32:02;32:05;"That must have been one of the last versions of that."
32:05;32:06;"--flavor of like--"
32:06;32:08;"A white guy putting on makeup."
32:08;32:11;"I think it was years beyond, like, it was already like--"
32:11;32:13;"I mean, 2012 sounds very late, but--"
32:13;32:18;"Yeah, I think it was like very questionable even at the time."
32:18;32:19;"That does sound familiar."
32:19;32:20;"Okay, okay, here's my thing."
32:20;32:25;"All due respect to Keith Bellinger, the creator of Pop Chips."
32:25;32:34;"If you told me, okay, there's a guy from Rancho Cucamonga in his garage, whatever,"
32:34;32:40;"he was a chemistry teacher, a Walter White type chemistry teacher, got laid off, sitting"
32:40;32:42;"around at home, and he had this--"
32:42;32:49;"started experimenting in the garage and he figured out how to air infuse potato starch"
32:49;32:52;"and it was kind of crunchy and he was selling them at the farmer's market, whatever."
32:52;32:57;"Next thing you know, it's a company that does $100 million in revenue, which maybe they"
32:57;32:59;"meant per year, which would be a different story."
32:59;33:00;"I would be like, that's an amazing story."
33:00;33:04;"That sounds like the Cliff guy who started Cliff Bar, just--"
33:04;33:09;"We love the story, just somebody cooking it up in the kitchen."
33:09;33:10;"Big League Chew."
33:10;33:13;"Big League Chew, the controversial Big League Chew."
33:13;33:18;"So if you told me that, I would say this is a great story of American ingenuity"
33:18;33:26;"and although you have not remotely come close to creating a product as iconic as Doritos,"
33:26;33:31;"Cheetos, or even Ruffles, my hat's off to you because you did something."
33:31;33:35;"You went from being an unemployed chemistry teacher to a very wealthy man."
33:35;33:41;"But the reason I don't feel that way is because my memory of Pop Chips is that it came out"
33:41;33:44;"of the gate with the big celebrity sponsors."
33:44;33:47;"So that makes it feel like a psyop."
33:48;33:50;"That's a psychological operation for people who don't know."
33:50;33:53;"Or what would you call it?"
33:53;33:54;"You know what it really is?"
33:54;33:55;"It's not a psyop."
33:55;33:56;"It's an industry plant."
33:56;34:01;"I think you're right about the psyop."
34:01;34:05;"In an article from-- when is this article?"
34:05;34:07;"2013 about Pop Chips."
34:07;34:08;"This is a great line."
34:08;34:11;"Pop Chips started with a distinctive edge."
34:11;34:15;"Quote, ""Popping was a breakthrough,"" says Kara Nelson."
34:16;34:21;"Food trendologist from CCD Innovation."
34:21;34:25;"Food trendologist."
34:25;34:26;"I mean, this is real--"
34:26;34:29;"We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here."
34:29;34:33;"We should get some food trendologists on."
34:33;34:36;"Wait, when you say that, are you saying what we're talking about or the show?"
34:36;34:36;"Both."
35:43;35:50;"The idea that there's Doritos-- the Frito-Lay company wanted to make a Pop Chips competitor"
35:50;35:53;"and dump $30 million or more to kick it off."
35:53;35:55;"It just doesn't compute."
35:55;36:00;"Maybe it's really doing $100 million a year, which I guess is pretty good."
36:00;36:02;"I do remember the Katy Perry--"
36:02;36:04;"It didn't say that."
36:04;36:05;"The Katy Perry placement."
36:05;36:09;"I mean, when she was at the peak of her popularity, she was like number one-- three number one"
36:09;36:10;"albums back to back."
36:10;36:11;"Then she was heavy on the Pop Chips."
36:11;36:12;"I remember that very well."
36:12;36:17;"Going to a grocery store, cardboard cutout, Katy Perry, TV commercials, social media."
36:17;36:20;"I remember even at the time, it felt like this is a lot."
36:20;36:25;"The only other thing that I could think of is that they launched in this era when you"
36:25;36:29;"were starting to have the multi-hyphenate entertainer business person."
36:29;36:32;"I don't know if anybody saw the new Shaq documentary."
36:32;36:35;"It's a four-part series on HBO Max."
36:35;36:36;"I enjoyed it."
36:36;36:37;"I'm a lifelong Shaq fan."
36:39;36:42;"They cover the basketball."
36:42;36:48;"Then once he retired, they're just like talk about how much he loved to work and make money."
36:48;36:53;"The documentary, obviously, it's a bit of a puff piece."
36:53;36:56;"They imply that Shaq is the one who--"
36:56;36:59;"That Shaq paved the way."
36:59;37:04;"He took what Michael Jordan did as being a spokesman and took it to the next level."
37:04;37:06;"He creates his own brand early and he's out there."
37:07;37:12;"He's often foregoing a payday for equity in the company."
37:12;37:14;"He says, ""People think I'm an athlete who got into business."
37:14;37:18;"I'm a businessman who happens to be athletic."""
37:18;37:18;"It's deep."
37:18;37:20;"I thought, right on."
37:20;37:28;"Anyway, I think in the post-Shaq universe and just in the 2000s, I guess it's possible"
37:28;37:33;"that some of these celebrities, somebody goes in and says, ""This is going to be the next Doritos."""
37:33;37:34;"I could totally picture them."
37:34;37:39;"2007, you're going on a roadshow meeting all these big Hollywood managers and stuff and"
37:39;37:44;"music industry people and you say, ""Guys, Doritos, it's so '90s."""
37:44;37:46;"Getting the cheese dust on your fingers."
37:46;37:48;"People today want something new."
37:48;37:50;"This is a trillion-dollar market."
37:50;37:57;"We have something that could change the game with our patented air infusion technology."
37:57;37:58;"It's different."
37:58;37:59;"It's modern."
37:59;38:01;"This is what people want now."
38:01;38:02;"It's light."
38:02;38:04;"We can pretend that it's healthier."
38:04;38:07;"All those things that you grew up eating, the greasy lays, all that stuff is going to"
38:07;38:09;"be left in the dustbin of history."
38:09;38:14;"This company, especially if it goes global, we get to dial in the flavors for Southeast"
38:14;38:16;"Asia, South America."
38:16;38:23;"If we dial that in, this company easily is doing, just very confidently, be like $4.7"
38:23;38:26;"billion a year in revenue in five years."
38:26;38:32;"Maybe you can go to the Katy Perry's and the Puffy's and say, ""We're prepared to offer you"
38:33;38:34;"1.5% of this company."""
38:34;38:38;"They're doing the math and they're like, ""4 billion, 1.5%?"""
38:38;38:40;"What is that, Seinfeld?"
38:40;38:40;"Oh, yeah."
38:40;38:41;"That's like--"
38:41;38:42;"600 million?"
38:42;38:43;"600 million."
38:43;38:44;"Yeah."
38:44;38:45;"That's what I was going to--"
38:45;38:46;"Wait, no."
38:46;38:47;"60 million."
38:47;38:49;"60, 50, 60 million."
38:49;38:49;"Yeah, yeah."
38:49;38:57;"You pick four celebrities, Katy Perry, Ashton Kutcher, Puffy, David Ortiz, and you promise"
38:57;39:01;"each of them 1.5% and say, ""I know that's a small number, but please, our projections"
39:01;39:03;"say 4.8 billion."""
39:03;39:08;"Yeah, and then they're starting to think, ""I'm making 60 to 80 million a year for doing"
39:08;39:09;"very little."""
39:09;39:10;"And then it's like, ""No, no, but hold on."
39:10;39:12;"We'll make sure you like the product."
39:12;39:13;"Hold on a second."
39:13;39:15;"Take a bite."
39:15;39:16;"I do like it."
39:16;39:17;"This is exactly the type of--"
39:17;39:20;"First, you talk the money, then you offer them the product."""
39:20;39:21;"So 1.5--"
39:21;39:21;"I want to get into this world."
39:21;39:23;"It's kind of exciting to me."
39:23;39:23;"It is."
39:23;39:29;"I want to go pre-sell shares of a lame snack company and see what the biggest celebrity"
39:29;39:30;"we can get is."
39:30;39:35;"Just go and just be like, ""Some terrible Puffy chip."
39:35;39:40;"Just see, can we make it to Bruno Mars and just be like, 'Bruno, all the money's gone"
39:40;39:41;"into R&D."
39:41;39:42;"If you're with us--'"""
39:42;39:43;"I can't believe I'm saying this."
39:43;39:45;"20% of the company."
39:45;39:46;"What about this?"
39:46;39:47;"Most chips are dry."
39:47;39:50;"What about a moist, soggy chip?"
39:50;39:51;"You know what I mean?"
39:51;39:52;"A wet chip."
39:53;39:54;"It's not oily."
39:54;39:56;"It's H2O infused."
39:56;39:56;"Right."
39:56;39:59;"And it's got a certain sort of liquid viscous--"
40:00;40:02;"Anyway, Ezra, you nailed it."
40:02;40:03;"Wet chips."
40:03;40:08;"It's like when you have your chips on a plate and you accidentally spill some water on it."
40:08;40:09;"Oh, yeah."
40:09;40:13;"No, I'm being like, ""And people-- and yeah, you think that people don't want that anymore."
40:13;40:17;"But Mr. Obama, I'm sorry, but since you left the White House, doesn't culture feel kind"
40:17;40:17;"of dry?"""
40:17;40:19;"You know what I mean?"
40:19;40:22;"They want it wet."
40:22;40:26;"I can't believe I'm saying this, Barack, but if you get on board for this and you film"
40:27;40:31;"two to seven commercials, we'll give you 99% of the company."
40:31;40:32;"I mean, we're nuts."
40:32;40:33;"We're nuts."
40:33;40:34;"But that's how much we believe in this."
40:34;40:39;"I mean, Michelle Obama was very pro-hydration, pro-health."
40:39;40:41;"You know, you could just like, ""We need more water in our chips."""
40:41;40:45;"Katy Perry was an investor in pop chips."
40:45;40:49;"LA Times 2012 reports that-- it all started with a tweet."
40:49;40:50;"She was promoting part of me."
40:50;40:55;"I don't know if you remember, Jake, her concert documentary part of me."
40:55;40:55;"Sure."
40:55;40:55;"Of course."
40:55;40:55;"Oh, yeah."
40:55;40:56;"It was very good."
40:56;40:58;"I think she broke up with Russell Brand in that one."
40:58;40:59;"Anyway--"
40:59;41:00;"I saw that in the theater."
41:00;41:01;"Yeah."
41:01;41:02;"Twice."
41:02;41:04;"I was on tour and I caught it."
41:04;41:05;"Yeah, it was cool."
41:05;41:07;"It seemed spectacular."
41:07;41:12;"So she says she found this in a mini bar in a hotel when she was promoting the film."
41:12;41:14;"She read the back of the label, saw that it was a healthy choice."
41:14;41:16;"She was hooked after her first bite."
41:16;41:18;"""When I discover something good, I want to share it with everyone."""
41:18;41:19;"So I tweeted about it."
41:19;41:21;"And the rest is history."
41:21;41:22;"Very organic."
41:22;41:25;"She just-- an unsolicited promotional tweet."
41:25;41:28;"When it says she's an investor, that implies she put in her own money."
41:28;41:29;"So that is pretty different."
41:29;41:31;"And she became a spokesperson for it."
41:31;41:32;"Well, yeah."
41:32;41:34;"Maybe we got to see the actual deal points."
41:34;41:36;"Maybe she just reached out to them and said, ""I'll be a spokesperson."""
41:36;41:39;"And just kick in 1.5."
41:39;41:41;"I'm sure it worked out for her."
41:41;41:41;"OK."
41:41;41:43;"But why was it in the hotel in the first place?"
41:43;41:44;"It was just like a regional snack?"
41:44;41:47;"It does feel like something that would be in a mini bar where you're like--"
41:47;41:47;"I don't believe any of that."
41:47;41:48;"Yeah, after that--"
41:48;41:49;"You think she--"
41:49;41:49;"I don't believe any of that."
41:49;41:50;"You think Katie's lying?"
41:50;41:52;"No, I think that--"
41:52;41:53;"So cynical, Nick."
41:53;41:56;"Well, I'm reading this article, which is essentially that they brought on the guy"
41:56;42:00;"that did Vitamin Water to basically be the consultant or partner in Popchips."
42:00;42:04;"And this says he did exactly what he did with Vitamin Water, which was bring on--"
42:04;42:05;"Go to the celebs."
42:05;42:06;"Yep."
42:06;42:10;"You have $0.50 famous Vitamin Water owner sold out for however many hundreds of millions"
42:10;42:11;"of dollars."
42:11;42:13;"So they first went to Ashton Kutcher."
42:13;42:16;"The funny part is they said, ""You create any kind of chip you want."""
42:16;42:19;"It seems here he created the Bombay chip."
42:19;42:19;"[LAUGHTER]"
42:19;42:20;"Oh, no."
42:20;42:21;"I swear to God."
42:22;42:23;"So it was Bombay flavored."
42:23;42:25;"And then he was like, ""Yeah, and then I'll do--"""
42:25;42:25;"I mean--"
42:25;42:28;"It's possible that the entire thing--"
42:28;42:34;"It's not just an accident that Ashton Kutcher ended up doing this brown face Indian character."
42:34;42:39;"It's actually when they asked him what flavor he wanted, he said, ""Anything that allows"
42:39;42:41;"me to do this character I've been working on."""
42:41;42:42;"Yeah."
42:42;42:46;"And then two months after that, Katy Perry signs on--"
42:46;42:47;"I'm with you."
42:47;42:49;"I don't buy that."
42:49;42:51;"And then immediately after that, it's--"
42:51;42:52;"Puffy?"
42:52;42:53;"Well, yep."
42:53;42:55;"Here are the rest of them."
42:55;42:59;"It's going to say that it's Jillian Michaels, Heidi Klum, and Diddy."
42:59;42:59;"Heidi Klum."
42:59;43:04;"So, I mean, this isn't an organic--"
43:04;43:04;"Yeah."
43:04;43:05;"How did David Ortiz get in?"
43:05;43:07;"[LAUGHTER]"
43:07;43:08;"He's passionate about snack food."
43:08;43:09;"That's a weird one."
43:09;43:09;"Yeah."
43:09;43:13;"Now, I hate to say it because I'm a Katy Perry fan."
43:13;43:14;"I think she's cool."
43:14;43:19;"But hopefully she wouldn't mind us just kicking the tires."
43:19;43:20;"It's just business."
43:20;43:24;"All I'm saying is that I think Katy's a savvy businesswoman."
43:24;43:28;"And it's possible that she sat down with the Vitamin Water guy."
43:28;43:31;"They said, ""Listen, we got Ashton Kutcher on board."
43:31;43:32;"And no, we're not punking you."
43:32;43:33;"You're about to be a billionaire."""
43:33;43:35;"And she said, ""OK, I like what I hear."""
43:35;43:36;"And then they gave her the product."
43:36;43:37;"And they said, ""But here's the thing."
43:37;43:40;"Vitamin Water, people saw it in stores first."
43:40;43:44;"They kind of half felt like they discovered it by the time they heard 50 Cent was a big"
43:44;43:45;"investor."
43:45;43:47;"They kind of felt like they were all in on it together."
43:47;43:49;"We don't want this to feel top down."
43:49;43:54;"Help us craft a narrative that feels like you, that kind of makes it sound like you"
43:54;43:55;"discovered it."""
43:55;43:59;"Because also, so you said this was all happening in 2007?"
43:59;44:02;"Well, the pop chip was created in 2007."
44:02;44:03;"I think it became a business then."
44:03;44:07;"But 2012 was when Katy Perry, I think, came into the fold."
44:07;44:09;"Oh, so it's exactly the Obama era."
44:09;44:14;"So they're probably talking to her about how the Obama campaign had a feeling of being"
44:14;44:17;"grassroots, even though there was also big money behind it."
44:17;44:21;"So I bet they said, ""Just when you announced it, let's make it seem like you discovered"
44:21;44:24;"it, not that we came to you selling you on it."""
44:24;44:30;"And then she says, ""I just happened to find this in my hotel room, and I love it."
44:30;44:31;"And I want to share it with you."""
44:31;44:33;"It's a good grassroots rollout campaign."
44:33;44:36;"Does the Four Seasons stock that chip in their minibar?"
44:36;44:37;"Yeah, we got to find out."
44:37;44:39;"We got to do some digging."
44:39;44:43;"I do feel like pop chips does have a minibar feel to it, because you open that minibar,"
44:43;44:45;"and it's sort of like 7 out of the 10 things."
44:45;44:46;"You're like, ""What?"
44:46;44:46;"I'm not sure."""
44:46;44:47;"Absolutely."
44:47;44:50;"But at a fancy hotel, I'm thinking kettle chip."
44:50;44:52;"But kettle chip is not as healthy as a pop chip."
44:52;44:55;"I mean, at a really fancy hotel, they're going to take the products sometimes and put them"
44:55;44:57;"in their own packaging."
44:57;45:01;"So your little Four Seasons gummy bears or something, your Four Seasons salted cashews."
45:01;45:06;"Also, the way that pop chips look is so slick and corporate that just the—it'd be one"
45:06;45:10;"thing if you found some mom and pop fudge company."
45:10;45:17;"You're just like, ""Guys, next time you're in Youngstown, Ohio, you got to try this."
45:17;45:18;"It's such a cool little place."""
45:18;45:23;"There's just something about picking up pop chips and then just being like, ""I need to"
45:23;45:25;"share this with people."""

01:02:31;01:02:33;"Maybe we're going too far."

01:02:36;01:02:36;"He doesn't care."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Let me Dark Horse."
01:02:38;01:02:38;"All right."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"I just want to see if you remember this at all."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"I won't."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"I love this song."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"With Juicy J."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Yeah, when this came out, it was like--"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"It's a real moment."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"What year did this come out, Seinfeld?"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"This was off a huge album."
01:02:53;01:02:57;"Also 2010, I want to say."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Let me see."
01:02:58;01:02:58;"No, later."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Oh, wait, 2013."
01:02:59;01:03:09;"Yeah, 2013 off of Prism, which had Roar, This Is How We Do."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"What a great song."
01:03:11;01:03:17;"I think this was a Max Martin."
01:03:17;01:03:17;"I don't like this."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"Hold on."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"Just see if you like the chorus."
01:03:20;01:03:20;"Wait for that chorus."
01:03:20;01:03:24;"Wait until you hear Juicy J's full verse."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"Is it going to go major key on the chorus?"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"So you want to play with magic?"
01:03:29;01:03:33;"Boy, you should know what you're falling for."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"Baby, do you dare to do this?"
01:03:37;01:03:41;"'Cause I'm coming at you like a Dark Horse."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"Are you ready for, ready for?"
01:03:44;01:03:48;"A perfect storm, a perfect storm."
01:03:48;01:03:51;"'Cause what's your mind, what's your mind?"
01:03:51;01:03:55;"There's no going back."
01:03:56;01:04:01;"[beatboxing]"
01:04:01;01:04:05;"My memories that Juicy J says, I'm going to go to his rap."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"My memories that he says something about Jeffrey Dahmer,"
01:04:07;01:04:12;"which I remember being like, that's a little too dark for a pop song."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"She's a beast."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"I call her karma."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"She eats your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Try not to leave the home."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"Shorty's heart is on steroids 'cause her love is so strong."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"You may fall in love when you meet her."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"If you get the chance, you better keep her."
01:04:29;01:04:33;"She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart, she turn cold as a freezer."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"That fairy tale ending put a knight in shiny armor."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"She can be my sleeping beauty."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"I'm going to put her in a coma."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Damn, I think I love her."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Shorty's so bad, but she's buggin', I don't care."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"This is such an era."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"Damn, I think I love her."
01:04:45;01:04:50;"She'll eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Like Jeffrey Dahmer."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Detailed, metaphorically, I think."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"She'll eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer."
01:04:56;01:05:00;"An iconic, influential artist and..."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Smart investor."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"And smart investor, perhaps."
01:05:04;01:05:08;"And I would say to connect it to the Super Bowl, very strong halftime show."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Oh yeah, she did a famous halftime show."
01:05:10;01:05:10;"One of the best."
01:05:10;01:05:15;"I think you can catch her hosting American Idol."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"Still?"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"Yeah, 8 p.m. on Fox."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Well, check your local listings."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"I wonder if she still rides for Popchips."
01:05:21;01:05:23;"Wow, still?"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"No, I mean, she's huge."
01:05:24;01:05:29;"Also, like, those kind of gigs hosting American Idol,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"I think the hosts, they're probably making more money doing that"
01:05:31;01:05:34;"than they made grinding it out in their arena tours."
01:05:34;01:05:39;"Okay, moving on."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Deep sigh."
01:05:40;01:05:43;"This is 25 minutes on Katy Perry."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Oh man."
01:05:44;01:05:48;"There was a Bob Dylan interview during our hiatus"
01:05:48;01:05:52;"that made some waves, at least in the Bob Dylan fan community."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"Bob sat down with the Wall Street Journal."
01:05:55;01:05:55;"Yeah."
01:05:55;01:06:04;"In the interview, people were excited because Bob talked a bunch about music that he liked."
01:06:04;01:06:08;"He was talking about younger musicians that he's found interesting."
01:06:08;01:06:13;"I know he said something about Grace Potter, Julian Casablanca."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"He very specifically wrote Julian Casablanca,"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"which I think knowing Bob is some, I don't know why, somehow it's on purpose."
01:06:20;01:06:23;"Jack White, Rag and Bone Man."
01:06:23;01:06:29;"But also, he says something about a Duff McKagan solo song."
01:06:29;01:06:33;"And you know, Duff McKagan, famous as a member of Guns N' Roses."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"I'm sure he's got some cool solo music, but it's not something"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"I've heard that many people talk about."
01:06:38;01:06:42;"So to have the great Bob Dylan shout him out was pretty interesting."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"And he doesn't just shout him out as just like,"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"""Bob, you know, who are some artists you like?"""
01:06:45;01:06:48;"You know, Duff McKagan's doing his thing."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"He really goes hard for him."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"They ask, ""How do you discover new music?"""
01:06:52;01:06:53;"This was the question Bob was asked."
01:06:53;01:06:57;"Said, ""Mostly by accident, by chance."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"If I go looking for something, I usually don't find it."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"In fact, I never find it."
01:07:01;01:07:06;"I walk into things intuitively when I'm most likely not looking for anything."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"There's a Duff McKagan song called 'Chip Away' that has profound meaning for me."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"It's a graphic song, chip away, chip away."
01:07:13;01:07:19;"Like Michelangelo breaking up solid marble stone to discover the form of King David inside."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"He didn't build him from the ground up."
01:07:20;01:07:23;"He chipped away the stone until he discovered the king."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"It's like my own songwriting."
01:07:25;01:07:29;"I overwrite something, then I chip away lines and phrases until I get to the real thing."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Shooter Jennings produced that record."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"It's a great song."""
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Duff was just like, ""Oh, hell yeah."""
01:07:34;01:07:35;"I mean, yeah."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Coming full circle too after G&R covering."
01:07:37;01:07:42;"You know, maybe this is Bob's way of paying back Duff and Guns N' Roses."
01:07:43;01:07:47;"After they covered 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door', we covered this on the show."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"I mean, Bob was just sort of like-"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"Kind of a breadhead at the time."
01:07:50;01:07:50;"Yeah."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"He just wanted the money and he made a lot of money."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"Hey, Axl, why don't you cover one of my songs?"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"Yeah, wait, that was the real thing."
01:07:58;01:08:05;"Then Axl said, ""Oh, actually, Bob, I gotta say, sir, as you might've heard,"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"we've been covering 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' in concert."
01:08:08;01:08:12;"And I hope you understand how much we look up to you and how covering your song is our way"
01:08:12;01:08:16;"of honoring you and your contribution to American music."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"And we actually do have plans on recording it in the studio."""
01:08:18;01:08:20;"You should put it on your next record."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"Actually, we're thinking about it and it'd be so meaningful."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"You should make it a single."
01:08:24;01:08:29;"We might, Bob, but first and foremost, we just want you to understand how much we look up to you,"
01:08:29;01:08:32;"admire your song craft, what you've done with your career,"
01:08:32;01:08:36;"everything you've contributed to the American musical ecosystem."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Well, if it makes me money, that sounds good to me, son."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Maybe one of those turkey clubs."
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Uh, all right, Bob."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"I don't work here."
01:08:45;01:08:51;"He's just like in their dressing room."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"He just barged in."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Uh, sure."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"The last one."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"Um, Bob, that is the last one."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"I don't give a s***."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"So he's a Duff guy."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Duff head."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"But yeah, it's classic."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Speaking of Duff."
01:09:05;01:09:10;"It's classic, Bob, to be, um..."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"Well, first of all, let's throw it on because..."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Yeah, I've actually never heard the song."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"I meant to look it up after we texted about this."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"So this is Duff McKagan, ""Chip Away."""
01:09:19;01:09:23;"Talking heads, I'm making dollars."
01:09:23;01:09:28;"It's like doing crack day after day."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"It's like doing crack day after day."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"Dropping taxes on business fathers."
01:09:33;01:09:37;"It'll work this time, they say."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Gotta rise up."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"Gotta keep on fighting."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"You know we've seen this all before."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Those vocals."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"This too shall stop."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"It's not bad."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"If we keep our heads on."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Very stoned."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"It'll work this time, they say."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Chip away, chip away."
01:10:00;01:10:03;"I'm gonna throw 'em."
01:10:03;01:10:06;"Chip away, gonna crave."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Something new."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"I chip away to the end."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Oh yeah, I like that fiddle."
01:10:12;01:10:12;"Tasty."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"Can you hear me calling?"
01:10:13;01:10:18;"Gonna wait 'til this is through."
01:10:18;01:10:23;"Oh, history has had some cravings."
01:10:23;01:10:28;"Some badass mother****** didn't give a ****."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Whoa, okay."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"If y'all would laugh, my mother'd holler."
01:10:35;01:10:38;"Oh, they put an end to this."
01:10:38;01:10:41;"Chip away, chip away."
01:10:41;01:10:44;"I'm gonna throw 'em."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Chip away, gonna crave."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"For something new."
01:10:48;01:10:51;"Chip away, chip away."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"Can you hear me calling?"
01:10:54;01:10:59;"Gonna wait 'til this is through."
01:11:12;01:11:12;"Tasteful."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"I hear it often nowadays."
01:11:23;01:11:26;"The earth is flat, or so they say."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"Living beings came to be, I was sucked one day."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Wait, Seinfeld."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"I think it was Duff."
01:11:32;01:11:35;"One of the guys from Guns N' Roses was an early Starbucks investor."
01:11:35;01:11:38;"Well, Duff's from Seattle."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"Oh yes, I think he was an early Starbucks investor."
01:11:40;01:11:47;"Yeah, so in '94, Duff decided to invest 100k in some local companies."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"He chose Starbucks, Microsoft, and Amazon."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Jesus Christ."
01:11:50;01:11:54;"Rock and roll, baby."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"What is that worth today?"
01:11:56;01:12:02;"That's like a full-on, you went back to the past and told yourself what you're investing in."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"That's like outperforming Warren Buffett."
01:12:04;01:12:10;"America's top investors by return percentage."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Warren Buffett, Duff McKagan."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"What's Duff's net worth?"
01:12:13;01:12:18;"Celebrity net worth, Duff McKagan, 70 million."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Right on, Duff."
01:12:20;01:12:20;"What's Slash?"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"All right, here we go."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Slash, celebrity net worth."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"130."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"90 million."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Wait."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"Yeah, they're not taking into account Duff's savvy investing."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"Oh, wait."
01:12:32;01:12:32;"Is that Axl Rose?"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Chip away, chip away."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"Oh yeah, 90 million."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Why does he?"
01:12:37;01:12:37;"You know what?"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"I love the thing about Bob sitting in the back of the tour bus, earbuds in."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"Just listening to Chip Away over and over again."
01:12:42;01:12:47;"Actually, Chip Away is the type of song, this might be hard to describe, but it's exactly"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"the type of song that I feel like we all might get into."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"Like listening to kind of like a late record by like a famous dude."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Nobody else is checking it out that much."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"You're like, I want to listen to that."
01:12:57;01:12:57;"You throw it on."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"You're just like, honestly, I really like track five."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"It'd totally be a song like this."
01:13:01;01:13:01;"Yeah."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"You're just like, chip away, chip away."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Yeah, the next day you're singing it."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"You're like, what is it?"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"Oh yeah, that's that Duff song."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Yeah, it's actually pretty good."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"Okay."
01:13:10;01:13:10;"All right, Bob."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"It's a solid song."
01:13:12;01:13:19;"So, you know, like we said, Bob described when he hears the song, Duff McKagan's song,"
01:13:19;01:13:23;"Chip Away, he thinks about Michelangelo breaking up the solid marble stone to discover the"
01:13:23;01:13:30;"form of King David and actually I have some old texts from the TC text thread where Jake"
01:13:30;01:13:34;"said, amazing first episode of 2023 Duff McKagan deep dive."
01:13:34;01:13:34;"Okay, we're doing it."
01:13:34;01:13:38;"And then Jake said, also the David is maybe the greatest artwork of all time."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"Just saying, I'm right there with Bob."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And then I said, didn't know you were David head."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Is it number one across all art forms for you?"
01:13:44;01:13:49;"Jake said, generally not a huge sculpture fan, but it's the scale of David that makes"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"it so amazing."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Like, I don't understand how he did it."
01:13:52;01:13:56;"It seems otherworldly in terms of iconic world, historical art pieces."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"It's a funny conversation to have."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"David is the goat bro."
01:13:59;01:14:04;"So Jake says greatest work of art, the David greatest rock song, Baba O'Reilly."
01:14:04;01:14:10;"But by work of art, you mean anything that a human being made to express themselves."
01:14:10;01:14:14;"I think I meant greatest work of art in this context, visual art."
01:14:14;01:14:14;"Okay."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"But like a painting or a sculpture."
01:14:17;01:14:17;"All right."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"But like, you know, this is single elimination."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"It's March madness time."
01:14:22;01:14:27;"You got it down to the David on one, one conference and the Eastern conference, Baba O'Reilly"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"and the Western."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"Now let's get serious."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"Which is better, the David or Baba O'Reilly?"
01:14:32;01:14:32;"Damn."
01:14:32;01:14:35;"You stumped me on this one, man."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"I would just get, yeah, that was interesting to me."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"You stumped me."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"That you love the David so much."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"So you like the David more than."
01:14:40;01:14:45;"Well, it's just like one of those things where you're just like, it's so huge."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"Yeah."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"So I asked if you, like, if you guys have seen it."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"No, I've never been to Florence."
01:14:49;01:14:50;"It's at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Yeah."
01:14:51;01:14:51;"It's okay."
01:14:51;01:14:57;"We've all seen old classical sculptures of the naked male form."
01:14:57;01:14:57;"Sure."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"They're everywhere."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"You go to a museum, you go to the Getty."
01:15:00;01:15:00;"Sure."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"A bunch of them there."
01:15:01;01:15:01;"Yeah."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"This thing is like Seinfeld number crunch."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"What's the height of the David?"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"It's immense."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"It's on a pedestal."
01:15:09;01:15:13;"I mean, basically the toes start at like where your eye level is."
01:15:13;01:15:13;"Jake?"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"And then, yeah."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"17 feet."
01:15:15;01:15:15;"Okay."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"I was going to guess 20."
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Oh, that's a big boy."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"It doesn't sound like a lot, but it's larger than life."
01:15:20;01:15:26;"It's this immense perfect sculpture of a man out of one."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"It wasn't like put together like Bob was saying."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"It was one giant block of marble."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"I just don't understand."
01:15:32;01:15:36;"I guess I like it so much because I just don't understand how he did it."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"A painting, because I'm a painter, I've done a lot of it."
01:15:39;01:15:39;"Right."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"There are paintings I see where I'm just like, I don't know how they did that."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"But I kind of still maybe can figure it out."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"Even some of the greatest paintings of all time."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"You're just like, okay, I can kind of see how he did that."
01:15:47;01:15:52;"And also with the painting, no disrespect to the art form, but you can do a lot of cheating."
01:15:52;01:15:58;"So, you know, like sometimes the X-ray, Leonardo da Vinci, he's a top guy."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"He's big in that world."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"Top guy."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"Top guy."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"They look through it, turns out he was painting over little flubs."
01:16:06;01:16:07;"He was using a pencil."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"He'd make mistakes."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Do you respect that?"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"When a guy uses a pencil?"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Absolutely."
01:16:12;01:16:12;"You respect that?"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"It's not cheating?"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Not cheating."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"I think they should have to say at the gallery though."
01:16:18;01:16:22;"You know, when I paint a picture of like a pizza hut or cheesecake factory, I'm free-handing."
01:16:22;01:16:27;"I'm not using any sort of pencils or rulers or any sort of rejection system."
01:16:27;01:16:32;"I just know intuitively the perfect shape of every little piece of tile and shingle."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Because you studied."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"You can just do that first time out."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Because you're a pro."
01:16:35;01:16:39;"And also, that's right, because you're out here selling paintings."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"Paintings."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Paint."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Not pencilings."
01:16:43;01:16:43;"Not rulerings."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"Not sketches."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Not sketches."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Right, because you haven't worked for that."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Sketches."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"That's when you take a pencil and canvas."
01:16:49;01:16:49;"That's all it is."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"A projection system."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"That's interesting."
01:16:51;01:16:56;"There are a lot of hacky lesser artists using projection systems to--"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"You're looking at them."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"Oh."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"You'll use a projection system?"
01:17:00;01:17:08;"I'll use an Epson digital projector to transfer the information that I plan out onto the--"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I transfer the information onto the canvas."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"I took you at face value, just like I took Katy Perry's mini fridge, mini bar storage."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"OK, but you always paint them."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"You're not using 3D printers yet."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"They are painted."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"OK."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"By hand."
01:17:20;01:17:20;"By hand."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Your hand."
01:17:22;01:17:22;"My hand."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"It's a mechanical hand."
01:17:23;01:17:26;"Actually, you know, Bob--"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Yeah, quote unquote, ""my hand."""
01:17:27;01:17:30;"Bob, yes, it's my hand."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"It belongs to nobody else."
01:17:32;01:17:39;"I paid $25,999 for it from a Korean robotics company, and it's mine."
01:17:39;01:17:42;"And when I said it was my hand, I meant it was my hand."
01:17:42;01:17:47;"You know, Bob got in trouble because when the book came out, the song book, he--"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"I don't want to say he."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"I don't want to put it all on the great Bob, but--"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"The publisher."
01:17:52;01:17:57;"The publisher was selling these expensive signed copies, as is typical."
01:17:57;01:18:02;"And I guess they found out that a lot of them were signed--"
01:18:02;01:18:07;"they kind of used some fancy word, like using some kind of like auto signer."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Right."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"When I'm like, you mean a printer?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"You mean just like a stamp?"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"I don't know what they mean."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"But-- and then, you know, you got to feel for Bob."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"Man's in his 80s, and he said he did start to sign them, and then he had like vertigo"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"or some kind of health issue that made it impossible."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"And there was a deadline, and he was assured by people who worked with him, like, ""This is done."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"This still counts as your signature."""
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Like, literally, it is like my hand."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"No, no, Bob, this still counts."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"This is not fake."
01:18:31;01:18:37;"This is still a one of a kind printed Bob Dylan signature that you authorized."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"So that's the same."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"And then people found out they were upset, and he--"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"clearly he felt bad."
01:18:41;01:18:44;"He went-- he put out a press release saying, ""I was assured that this was normal."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"It's only because I had vertigo."""
01:18:45;01:18:50;"Anyway, I love that you're writing for the David so hard."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"Yeah, so you're subtracting-- you have this huge block of marble."
01:18:53;01:18:53;"Right."
01:18:53;01:18:53;"Subtracting."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"And I just-- I can't even imagine just like--"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Do you think he used pencils?"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"I have no idea how he does it, how he did it."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"Any of those-- any of that sort of art form, but at that scale, I mean--"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"It was aliens."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"It was ancient aliens."
01:19:06;01:19:06;"Ancient aliens."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"I mean, all the-- and that's how they--"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"One mistake."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Also, it's marble."
01:19:10;01:19:11;"I mean, you're chipping away."
01:19:11;01:19:14;"It's like-- what if it like breaks in a weird way?"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Or like-- I just don't understand how you would do that."
01:19:17;01:19:18;"I just don't understand."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"I mean, all-- and does Bernini-- I've seen some of the Berninis."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Those are incredible too."
01:19:22;01:19:22;"Yeah."
01:19:22;01:19:27;"How could you even figure that out and have it so hyper-realistic?"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"And--"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"That's one thing that-- yeah, I don't-- I don't think people--"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"I'm sure there are people who are doing it, but you just don't see like--"
01:19:33;01:19:37;"You know, you go into a gallery in Chelsea, and you're like, ""Oh, marble sculpture."""
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Right."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"You just don't see it."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"I don't know."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"And if somebody was doing it now, you could totally picture a young artist."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"Machine routered."
01:19:44;01:19:48;"Yeah, it would totally be 3D printed, machine cut, and it would be some sort of--"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"It'd be like a bit."
01:19:50;01:19:50;"Right."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"All this stuff I found, like this internet porn--"
01:19:52;01:19:52;"Right."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"--and they're turning into--"
01:19:53;01:19:53;"Yeah."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Yeah."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"This is Mayor Hamburgerhead f***ing his own d***."
01:19:57;01:19:57;"Yeah."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"In marble."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Did you carve it by hand?"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"It's like-- no, I sent an email to a factory in China."
01:20:03;01:20:07;"I said, ""I need a three-foot high Mr. Mayor Hamburger s***ing his own d***."
01:20:07;01:20:10;"Can you send it to this gallery in Chelsea?"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Get it by next month."""
01:20:12;01:20:14;"I mean, does that ever-- actually, does that ever happen in the art world, Jake?"
01:20:14;01:20:19;"Where it's like, because you have the people who still enjoy--"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"I know there's a lot of people."
01:20:20;01:20:23;"Like, you paint by hand."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"You're interested in like the history of painting."
01:20:25;01:20:28;"You might have some slight different tools at your disposal."
01:20:28;01:20:32;"But in a way, you are doing what people have been doing for hundreds of years."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"And kind of an ancient tradition."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"Thousands."
01:20:35;01:20:35;"Thousands of years."
01:20:36;01:20:40;"Going back to the cave paintings in Lascaux in France."
01:20:40;01:20:40;"Absolutely."
01:20:40;01:20:42;"An unbroken tradition."
01:20:42;01:20:47;"Whereas today, you also get these big conceptual artists, right?"
01:20:47;01:20:52;"Basically, the idea guys who might come in and just--"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"and maybe their ideas are great."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"Maybe it's some exciting thing."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"People are going to walk in the gallery and the first thing you see is the--"
01:20:57;01:21:04;"Are there situations where somebody who's studied, painstakingly learned how to sculpt"
01:21:04;01:21:09;"or paint ends up just kind of like working for like just an ideas guy?"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"That happens all the time?"
01:21:11;01:21:11;"For sure."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"Like you're somebody who's been like studying the greats, painting since childhood."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Yes."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"Went to art school."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"You're so concerned."
01:21:18;01:21:18;"Then you just get like--"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"You're working for Jeff Koons."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"I mean, that's probably a good gig."
01:21:21;01:21:21;"But yeah, you're working for--"
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Right."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"Absolutely."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"And maybe they're cool."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"But maybe it could also just be like a bozo."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"Just being like, ""I need an exact replica of the Mona Lisa."""
01:21:29;01:21:30;"I'm sure."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Except you can write like, ""She sucks."""
01:21:32;01:21:32;"I mean, no."
01:21:32;01:21:32;"On the bottom."
01:21:33;01:21:36;"There definitely are fine artists that have stuff painted for them in China."
01:21:36;01:21:43;"I mean, it's part of the conceptual kind of rigor or story of the art."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"Like they're making commentary on the global marketplace."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Yeah."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Capitalism."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Yeah."
01:21:49;01:21:53;"And then you're like, ""Okay, well, I have this kind of mediocre painting to show for it."
01:21:53;01:21:53;"Awesome."""
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Right."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"But yeah, I mean, yeah."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"That's part of the story."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"That's definitely a thing."
01:21:57;01:21:57;"Okay."
01:21:57;01:22:02;"But I can see in this context that the sheer ingenuity of like, ""How was the David made?"""
01:22:02;01:22:06;"And why that over any other sculpture you've ever seen?"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Just the scale."
01:22:07;01:22:12;"The size of it is just like, you walk into the room and you're just like, ""Oh my God, that's crazy."""
01:22:12;01:22:14;"But you must've seen some other big..."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"What about the Statue of Liberty?"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Why does it got to be something Italian?"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"That's not hand carved out of a piece of marble."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Although that's true."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"I don't know how they made that."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"I mean, honestly, Mount Rushmore is pretty impressive."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"(laughter)"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"It's a mountain."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"James is like, ""Big stuff."""
01:22:30;01:22:34;"I mean, it's like if you're Michelangelo and you mess up the David, maybe he did."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"Maybe this is his third try and he nailed it."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"Mount Rushmore, you kind of only have one shot."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"No, I don't understand that."
01:22:41;01:22:44;"I don't understand how you do that kind of stuff."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"It's wild to me."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"Has there ever been a movie like, you know, Ghostbusters style where like,"
01:22:49;01:22:53;"the David gets like haunted or like struck by like a lightning or like come to life?"
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Kind of like walk around."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"It's a big..."
01:22:55;01:22:55;"Yeah, like it's a..."
01:22:55;01:22:58;"Has it ever happened?"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"I feel like I've seen it with Mount Rushmore in movies."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"Like George Washington's like, ""Ooh."""
01:23:02;01:23:05;"But like, do you know what I'm talking about?"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"Oh, you like a night at the museum?"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Like a night at the museum style."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"There's Mount Rushmore."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"That'd be fun to make like a real cheap indie version."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"Jake's a night at the Uffizi Gallery."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"Yeah, there we go."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"(laughter)"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"When an American painter finds himself accidentally locked"
01:23:21;01:23:26;"in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence late at night."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"(laughter)"
01:23:29;01:23:32;"He goes face to face with his all time favorite work of art."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Except the David's like really pissed off or something."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"Not favorite, greatest."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Greatest, I see."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Now, but I'm with you."
01:23:39;01:23:43;"There have been times when I've seen large scale."
01:23:43;01:23:48;"Like for instance, in Japan, there's a whole bunch of these famous, like huge Buddhas."
01:23:48;01:23:54;"Some of which were made in like, like around the year 700, for instance."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"And you see these like really old, sometimes they're made out of bronze or something."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"And just to be like, kind of confronted by that."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"Yeah, the scale, it is, it kind of knocks you out."
01:24:04;01:24:06;"Yeah, I can picture that."
01:24:06;01:24:10;"Just holding up like a huge hand in this like beautiful space that was just made for people"
01:24:10;01:24:15;"to come from far and wide, just to like sit and look up at this representation of the Buddha."
01:24:15;01:24:19;"That reminds me, when I went to Mexico City, like five or six years ago,"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"went to the big museum there."
01:24:20;01:24:23;"And there's this huge, I don't know the name of it,"
01:24:23;01:24:27;"but this huge sculpture of like the sun god."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"It's just like mounted onto the wall, but it's all stone."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"It must weigh like some ungodly amount."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"Like from the pre-Columbian times, like on my end."
01:24:34;01:24:34;"Yeah, yeah."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"It's not by like a famous artist."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Big sculptures rule."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"And actually, how about down in Rio, the Cristo?"
01:24:42;01:24:43;"Never seen it, but yeah."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"But it's like, it's iconic."
01:24:45;01:24:45;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"It's sick."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"Arms out."
01:24:47;01:24:48;"How big is that boy?"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Is that a big boy?"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Statue of Liberty?"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"How tall is it?"
01:24:56;01:24:56;"Oh, no, no."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"The one down in Rio."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"Oh, the Jesus?"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Yeah."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"I always call it the Cristo."
01:25:02;01:25:02;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"Cristo."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"That is 98 feet."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Oh, it's massive."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Right, yeah."
01:25:09;01:25:12;"Because when you see it in like a movie, it's like a helicopter shot."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"You could be like, what's that, 10 feet?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"10, 15 feet?"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Yeah, yeah."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"I wouldn't have thought it was that big."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Yeah, massive."
01:25:18;01:25:23;"I mean, this almost verges sort of into like the seven wonders of the world."
01:25:23;01:25:23;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"And I went to the-"
01:25:24;01:25:25;"Colossus of Rhodes."
01:25:25;01:25:29;"Went to China once and I went to the Great Wall, which is insane."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"But I couldn't help but just think of like the slave labor that went into making the-"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"Right."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"The Great Wall is sort of beautiful and it's breathtaking."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"And again, it's scale."
01:25:38;01:25:38;"Right."
01:25:38;01:25:45;"But it's not like aesthetic in the way that like the sun god, Mexico City or the David is."
01:25:45;01:25:45;"Right."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"It's just like brutal."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Last question, you Grand Canyon fan?"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"This is a great shame."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"I've never been."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"And I need to go."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"It's on my list."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Have you been?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"No, I've never been."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"In fact, there was one time-"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Road trip."
01:25:58;01:25:58;"TC, road trip."
01:25:58;01:26:04;"I had the chance to go when Vampire Weekend was on tour and I felt like, I don't need to see that."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"Really, dude?"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"You do."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Well, and that's why I'm trying to like reconnect."
01:26:08;01:26:08;"Let's go."
01:26:08;01:26:13;"That's why I like that you're ranking the David as the goat, because I do feel like there's a lot"
01:26:13;01:26:18;"of just things that feel so familiar to me that I probably would pass up the chance."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Like I've never gone up to the Statue of Liberty."
01:26:20;01:26:25;"And now I kind of understand as I get older, like, no, it's cool to go see these things,"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"even if they seem basic."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"Like I told you how we were in Japan spending time at Mount Fuji."
01:26:31;01:26:31;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:26:31;01:26:37;"And I'd seen it from the plane before, but to actually go right up to it, to go up it a bit,"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"climb up, there was something about you're like, this is the best mountain in the world."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"No, there's a reason."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Greatest mountain in the world."
01:26:44;01:26:48;"Greatest mountain in the world, Mount Fuji, greatest regard to David, greatest rock song,"
01:26:48;01:26:53;"Bob O'Reilly, greatest pop song, Hot and Cold by Katy Perry."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"All right."
01:26:54;01:26:54;"Teenage dream."
01:26:54;01:26:58;"Let's get into the top five."
01:26:58;01:27:04;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:27:04;01:27:09;"We're going to be comparing the top five hits right now with 1989."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Why 1989?"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"I actually have no idea."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Because this is episode 189."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Okay."
01:27:14;01:27:14;"Wow."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"That's crazy."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"We've created hundreds of hours of content."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Top shelf content."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"That's right."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Greatest internet radio show."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"Time Crisis, hands down."
01:27:26;01:27:32;"The number five song this week in 1989, speaking of Duff McKagan,"
01:27:32;01:27:39;"it's his band Guns N' Roses with Paradise City."
01:27:39;01:27:47;"Jake, do you remember where you were when you first saw this music video?"
01:27:47;01:27:50;"Probably in my living room."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Do you remember it?"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"I remember it vividly."
01:27:53;01:27:53;"Yeah."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Jordan Stein's basement."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Oh, nice, dude."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"I don't know if I've ever seen the video."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Is there something special about it?"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"No, it's just cool concert footage or them on tour."
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Yeah."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Like sound checking in an empty arena."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Yeah."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"Like an intimate kind of like view of the tour."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Like real rock star stuff though."
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Yeah."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Very cool."
01:28:13;01:28:24;"The beginning of the song is awesome."
01:28:24;01:28:24;"This part rules."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"This synth is pretty cool."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"He's also doing a lot of his snake dancing."
01:28:28;01:28:28;"Yeah."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"With the synth, I thought it was kind of like a 70s, proggy synth."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Okay, this part is so sick."
01:28:39;01:28:42;"Also, this is a pretty wild song."
01:28:42;01:28:47;"Just like does the chorus and then just like another minute of instrumentalist jamming."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Kind vibe."
01:28:49;01:28:54;"And then they go to the riff rock part."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"The whistle?"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Whistle's tight."
01:28:56;01:29:01;"I picture Axl on like the catcher's protective gear with the whistle."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"This song was number, peaked at number five on the Billboard 100."
01:29:25;01:29:29;"I wonder if like when this came out, it was felt a little bit throwback."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"I think G&R kind of did."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Yeah, because it is hair metal, but it's also like,"
01:29:33;01:29:38;"I bet this felt a little more 70s than some of their contemporaries."
01:29:38;01:29:38;"Definitely that intro."
01:29:48;01:29:52;"Well, I remember like seeing an interview with Axl on MTV when I was a kid"
01:29:52;01:29:55;"and him being like, ""We're just like a great 70s band."""
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Oh, really?"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"And I remember being really confused."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"I was like, ""What?"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Like it's 1988."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"What are you talking about?"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Like you're like the best band in 1988."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Why do you mean you're..."""
01:30:04;01:30:09;"And I didn't know, like, I couldn't parse out like, ""Oh, this is early 70s Stones or like..."""
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Right."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"Yeah."
01:30:11;01:30:11;"Skinnered."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"And he was probably just looking around at his contemporaries like"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Miley Crue and Poison."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"And I bet he was just like, ""This sucks."""
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Yeah, yeah."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"You got Stones, Skinnered, then Lizzy."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Yeah."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"But what was Joe Walsh's band?"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Like Funk 49?"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"Uh-huh."
01:30:34;01:30:34;"Oh, for sure."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"What's that band called?"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"James Gang."
01:30:37;01:30:37;"Oh, James Gang."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Yeah."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"Cool dudes in the 80s are always like, ""It's all about James Gang."""
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Yeah."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Yeah, this structure."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"What else was happening like this?"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"This part."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Oh, this is cool."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"What is this song about?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Because it kind of seems like in the..."
01:31:35;01:31:39;"Obviously, he's talking about the Paradise City and the choruses."
01:31:39;01:31:44;"But then in some of the verses, he's describing a more dystopian environment."
01:31:44;01:31:48;"Axl Rose told Hit Parader that the verses are more about being in the jungle."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"So LA."
01:31:50;01:31:50;"Right."
01:31:50;01:31:53;"And the chorus is more like being in the Midwest or somewhere."
01:31:53;01:31:53;"Indiana."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"It's pretty sick."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"""Welcome to the jungle in Paradise City."""
01:31:58;01:31:59;"It's two sides of the same coin."
01:32:16;01:32:21;"Sounds like they wrote this in the back of a tour bus coming back from San Francisco"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"before Appetite got this."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Very cinematic."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"Picturing them driving down I-5."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"This double time."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"This is so '70s."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"I mean, this is so Skinnered."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"Yeah, right."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Yeah, no, exactly."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Yeah, this is like the end of Freebird, right?"
01:32:41;01:32:41;"Yeah."
01:32:45;01:32:50;"Picture the white Econoline pulling into the Taco Bell in and out in Kettleman City."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"1985, '86."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Yeah."
01:32:53;01:32:54;"Let me get the double double."
01:32:54;01:32:58;"Slash is in the back seat working out the riffs."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"What a time."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"They're like looking for a place that'll sell them another bottle of Jack."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"Yeah, just trying to keep the party going."
01:33:04;01:33:11;"Paradise City got a renewed boost in 2022 after being included in the trailer and film"
01:33:11;01:33:12;"Thor Love and Thunder."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"Oh."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Missed that one."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Thank you, Marvel."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"And you guys see it?"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Yeah."
01:33:19;01:33:19;"You saw it?"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"I did."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"With your son?"
01:33:21;01:33:21;"With my son."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Did it roll?"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Everybody says the Thor movies are the best ones."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"The Thor movies are the best ones."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"I'm not a Marvel guy."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"If you're going to do superheroes, make it fun."
01:33:30;01:33:30;"Yeah."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Make it funny."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Right."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Deadpool, the Thor movies."
01:33:34;01:33:34;"Uh-huh."
01:33:34;01:33:39;"So this one, and these are Taika Waititi ones, so they already have a sense of humor."
01:33:39;01:33:43;"I'm excited for like the Thor reimagined, the dark Thor."
01:33:43;01:33:43;"The dark."
01:33:43;01:33:46;"Well, so, but it's not just-"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"Enough jokes, Thor."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"I'll say what's interesting about it is that it's not just used."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"It's like integral."
01:33:52;01:33:58;"The Guns and Roses catalog is very fundamental to that whole movie."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Is Thor a GNR fan?"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"It's like either they say he's a GNR fan or it's just-"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"Every time Thor hears Paradise City, he goes goblin mode."
01:34:05;01:34:05;"Yes."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"It is like that."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"So it's not just like, oh, they use it at a cool moment."
01:34:09;01:34:13;"The way, you know, the Metallica, that Metallica song."
01:34:13;01:34:16;"Which one is it is using Stranger Things and it had a huge boost from-"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"Master of Puppets."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"Yeah, Master of Puppets."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"It's like, that's just sort of like, oh, it's a cool moment."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"This is like very much a part of it."
01:34:20;01:34:24;"Thor's like, Loki, play Appetite for Destruction,"
01:34:24;01:34:25;"my Appetite for Destruction tape."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"And he's like, goblin mode."
01:34:28;01:34:34;"We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone."
01:34:34;01:34:34;"And Gen Z."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"All the deep album cuts."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"Gen Z's just loving it."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Full rocket queen."
01:34:39;01:34:43;"The zoomers had not heard of Guns and Roses."
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Guns and Roses, it's like the David, you know?"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Seems basic."
01:34:47;01:34:47;"Right."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"But once you actually-"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"No, that's real."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Spend some time with it, you're like, damn."
01:34:51;01:34:51;"Yeah."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"I'm sure there's actually-"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"How many American kids do you think, like, or young adults,"
01:34:57;01:35:02;"do you think went on some sort of school trip or family trip to Italy,"
01:35:02;01:35:07;"dragged to Florence to go see the art, jamming Appetite for Destruction on their-"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Oh, like in 1988?"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Yeah, on their headphones."
01:35:09;01:35:13;"They get dragged into the Uffizi Gallery, see the David, and they're like,"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"all right, that is pretty sick, actually."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Yeah."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"And actually, this is like chocolate and peanut butter or whatever, man."
01:35:19;01:35:22;"This is like Appetite for Destruction and David."
01:35:22;01:35:22;"David."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"The height of Western civilization, bro."
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Absolutely."
01:35:26;01:35:30;"And here we are, 35 years later, being like, damn."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Yeah."
01:35:31;01:35:41;"So, you know, there's like three big pivotal moments in Thor, Love and Thunder."
01:35:41;01:35:41;"I'm looking at the plot."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Where they-"
01:35:42;01:35:43;"No, no, no."
01:35:43;01:35:46;"And they use sweet child of mine, welcome to the jungle,"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"and then the final one is November rain."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Whoa."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"All right."
01:35:50;01:35:54;"Do you need some time on your own?"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"I guess why not?"
01:35:56;01:36:00;"All right, the number five song this week in the modern times,"
01:36:00;01:36:03;"Metro Boomin featuring The Weeknd with Creepin."
01:36:03;01:36:06;"No, N21 Savage."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Just can't believe this, man."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"Oh, so this is like-"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"This is like the Fugees."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"No."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"Yeah, that's-"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Ready or not."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"But do you know the original sample?"
01:36:26;01:36:27;"The original, it's a cover."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"Enya."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Delphonics."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Oh, Delphonics had that song."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"Ready or not."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"But the beat is an Enya sample."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"And somebody else did, I don't want to know."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Was that like Mario?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"This is J. Soul."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"J. Soul."
01:36:40;01:36:41;"Yeah, this is Keep It On The Low."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"It's a cover."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"His name is J. Soul?"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Yeah."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Wow, I don't remember J. Soul at all."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Sorry."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"It's not Mario?"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"No, no, it's Mario."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Sorry, no."
01:36:50;01:36:53;"It's the Mario Wynard song and then P. Diddy did the cover of it."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"Wow."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"So wait, are the guys from the Delphonics credited here in the songwriters?"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"No, here's the thing, Jake."
01:36:58;01:37:01;"Jake, here's the thing."
01:37:01;01:37:05;"The Fugees song took a small piece of an Enya song."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"They did their song and they sang Delphonics on top."
01:37:10;01:37:15;"Subsequently, other people sampled the same Enya song without using the Delphonics."
01:37:15;01:37:19;"So in this song, they're not actually referencing the Ready or Not part."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"They're not singing Ready or Not."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"Yeah, but they're referencing this other song, Mario."
01:37:23;01:37:27;"But I have that so ingrained in my head, the Fugees version."
01:37:27;01:37:30;"It didn't even occur to me that--"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"I thought The Weeknd was singing Ready or Not."
01:37:32;01:37:33;"Right, right, right."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"But he's singing, I don't want to know."
01:37:35;01:37:38;"And do you remember the Mario Wynand's Diddy version?"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:39;"I feel like there was a good--"
01:37:39;01:37:42;"If you're creepin'."
01:37:42;01:37:45;"And that's why the song's called Creepin', because that comes from that Mario song."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"If you're creepin'."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"I kind of remember that song."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"It was a great song."
01:37:49;01:37:53;"All right, the number four song in '89, Bobby Brown with Rony."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"I mean, he's talking about tenderoni, right?"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"Rice-a-rony."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Rice-a-rony."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"Right, rice."
01:37:58;01:38:04;"I like that the Rice-a-rony was branded as that San Francisco tree."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"San Francisco was just like, ""What does that mean?"""
01:38:07;01:38:08;"Yeah, man."
01:38:08;01:38:11;"""I'm gonna eat some San Francisco food tonight."""
01:38:11;01:38:14;"You're like a housewife in Dallas and you're like, ""You know what?"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"Let's give the kids something a little exotic tonight."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"That San Francisco treat."""
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Let's give them a treat."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Rice."
01:38:20;01:38:25;"Okay, so this song's actually--"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Rice-a-rony."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"This song was written by Babyface."
01:38:28;01:38:33;"Rony is short for tenderoni, which was a stovetop macaroni sold from the 1950s to the 1980s."
01:38:33;01:38:34;"I did not know that."
01:38:35;01:38:39;"The first known usage of tenderoni as a term of affection was the OJ song,"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"""She's Only a Woman"" in 1975."
01:38:41;01:38:46;"And of course, the great popularizer of the term, Michael Jackson in PYT."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"He says tenderoni in PYT?"
01:38:48;01:38:51;"Must have been a pretty popular product."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Actually, that kind of reminds me."
01:38:52;01:38:55;"This is not exactly the same thing, but it's like, of course, now looking back,"
01:38:55;01:38:59;"tenderoni, it makes sense that it would come from macaroni, but I didn't know it was actually"
01:38:59;01:39:00;"a macaroni."
01:39:00;01:39:05;"And I found out a weird one too, because it's another kind of like suffix that you take for"
01:39:05;01:39:08;"granted is a dumpster."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"So of course, we know what a dumpster is."
01:39:09;01:39:13;"And then dumpster has led the -ster suffix."
01:39:13;01:39:17;"There's all sorts of like, you could call something the something -ster, but dumpster"
01:39:17;01:39:21;"is the original thing that had -ster at the end."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"What's another thing you call a -ster?"
01:39:22;01:39:25;"Well, you could call somebody by their name, like the Nickster."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"No, but that's a good--"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"There are other versions."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"I can't think of it."
01:39:30;01:39:35;"Um, Sam, let me get a number crunch on -ster suffix words."
01:39:35;01:39:39;"But look, there's like the 90s SNL thing of adding it as a joke."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"The Nickster, the Jakester."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"Right."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Buster."
01:39:43;01:39:44;"Yeah, that might predate it."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Youngster."
01:39:46;01:39:47;"Huckster."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Spinster."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Teamster."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Teamster may be post-dumpster."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Well, anyway, but this is focusing on the word dumpster."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"I kind of thought like--"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"Great word."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"And at the time I was kind of thinking, well, like, yeah, it's like, obviously you dump"
01:40:00;01:40:05;"stuff into it and you call it a dumpster because that's like what makes it a thing."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"And I was kind of like, that vaguely made sense."
01:40:07;01:40:12;"But actually the reason it's called a dumpster is that the dumpsters, we know it was invented"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"by the Dempster Brothers."
01:40:14;01:40:14;"Oh, wow."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"Okay."
01:40:15;01:40:15;"Oh."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"And they just like, nah, it's a dumpster."
01:40:18;01:40:23;"No, like if they had been like the Kowalski brothers, it'd be called the Dumpski."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"But their name sounds already like dumpster."
01:40:26;01:40:26;"That's almost--"
01:40:26;01:40:27;"No, no."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"That's my point is that--"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Ah, they're like Dempsters too Jewish."
01:40:30;01:40:30;"No, no."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"We gotta go with dumpster."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"No, if they were Jewish, we'd be called Dumpstein."
01:40:35;01:40:39;"If they were--"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Oh man, someone just dumped their trash in the dumpster."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"In the dumpster."
01:40:42;01:40:48;"You got to put a padlock on that dumpster, man."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Otherwise this is going to get crashed."

01:40:54;01:40:57;"If they're Polish, it would be a dumpski."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"And if they were Italian, it might've been like dumpio."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Okay, Dempster Brothers Wiki."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"The Dempster dumped--"
01:41:05;01:41:08;"Okay, this is amazing."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"The Dempster Dumpmaster."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Dumpmaster?"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"Dumpmaster is great."
01:41:14;01:41:19;"The Dempster Dumpmaster introduced in the 1950s was the first commercially successful"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"front-loading garbage truck in the United States."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"It was a truck."
01:41:24;01:41:27;"The product uses the Dempster dumpster system"
01:41:27;01:41:33;"of mechanically emptying standardized metal containers,"
01:41:33;01:41:36;"which had been patented by the company in 1937."
01:41:36;01:41:40;"It had arms in the front to pick up the dumpster and lifted it over the cab"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"to tip it into the hopper."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"'Cause that's what a dumpster is."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"It's a big thing that a specialized truck can pick up and dump."
01:41:47;01:41:47;"Exactly."
01:41:47;01:41:52;"The rearward traveling compacting panel compressed the garbage stored in the truck"
01:41:53;01:41:57;"and was also used to push it out the door at the back when it was being emptied."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"That's a huge breakthrough."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Yeah, so my point is that--"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"The Dempster Dumpster."
01:42:01;01:42:04;"It's called a dumpster, not just 'cause you add stir to something."
01:42:04;01:42:08;"You would only think to do that if you were one of the Dempsters."
01:42:08;01:42:08;"Yes."
01:42:08;01:42:12;"And if they had had a different last name, it could have had a totally different--"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"The Longstreth Brothers, it would have been--"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Wouldn't have worked."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"It would have been a dumpstreth."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"It just would have just faded into obscurity."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"Ezra, have you ever--"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"The Dempster Dumpmaster."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"Have you ever been referred to as a songster?"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Okay, yeah, songster."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"That is something people say."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"I think that's a post-dumpster word."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"And I guess you're right."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"When you say jester, there are these words that obviously predate dumpster."
01:42:34;01:42:38;"But I think the idea of you just add stir as a thing, he's a songster."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Yeah, I think that's post-dumpster."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"And we owe that to the Dempster Brothers' last name."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"Thank you for your service."
01:42:45;01:42:49;"And I think actually the patent expired or something."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"So they don't even own the word anymore."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"It's in the public domain."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Yeah."

01:52:16;01:52:17;"You're like, ""Yeah, that sounds good."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"No, yeah, that's a hit."

01:52:20;01:52:22;"A little bit, yeah."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"No, man, I was reverent."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"Oh, really?"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"It's just like, lie in my bed and vibe."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"Oh, okay."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"I'm more like that."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Did you listen to a lot of hip hop?"
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I listened exclusively to hip hop in high school."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"I think that that's more-"
01:52:33;01:52:37;"I think that that's an element of buying a lot of hip hop CDs."
