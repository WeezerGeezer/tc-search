00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis. Back in the same room once again. Reunited, and it feels so good."
00:08;00:13;"This week, Jake and I are joined in the studio by rock and roll legend Huey Lewis."
00:13;00:19;"That's right, the hits just keep on coming. All that, plus a recap of the"
00:19;00:23;"Hollywood Bowl and the live debut of Mountain Brews by Vampire Weekend at"
00:23;00:32;"Red Rocks, Night 2. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:20;01:26;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. I'm here with Jake. Hey. Got Seinfeld in the"
01:26;01:32;"building. Hey, what's up? You miss a couple? Yeah, I missed the Bon Iver episode. Oh yeah."
01:32;01:38;"Well, he's a friend's guy anyway. Did we ask Bon Iver about Seinfeld? We"
01:38;01:43;"definitely talked Hot Cheetos and Twiddle. And Chipotle. I listened to the app the other day."
01:43;01:47;"Oh yeah, you listened. Right, because we only talked on the phone for the intro."
01:47;01:51;"The thing that blew my mind was when he was like, ""Well, Steve Miller has more"
01:51;01:55;"great songs than the Dead."" Oh yeah, that was crazy. It might have just been"
01:55;01:59;"Wisconsin Pride. We're talking about the last episode for people who are just..."
01:59;02:02;"Episode recap. People are just getting into... Maybe this is the first episode of"
02:02;02:06;"TC you're listening to. If this is the first episode of Time Crisis you're"
02:06;02:09;"listening to, you know, it's an internet radio show, me and Jake Seinfeld,"
02:09;02:14;"whatever. But the last episode, we had Justin Vernon from Bon Iver on."
02:14;02:19;"It's a big get. And he's so into the jams. He's so into the live dead."
02:19;02:24;"Obviously, it doesn't have to be a zero-sum game, but I think his vibe was so"
02:24;02:30;"into the live stuff. The songs or whatever, I'm interested in the jams and where"
02:30;02:34;"they take them. I think he also was referring to the fact that Steve Miller"
02:34;02:40;"has crazy hits on classic rock radio that have been played nonstop for 50 years."
02:40;02:43;"And the Dead really don't. Yeah, you might get the odd trucking,"
02:43;02:48;"depending on your local station. Say what you will about the Dead's body of work."
02:48;02:52;"Steve Miller produced hits. I mean, come on. Fly Like an Eagle?"
02:52;02:56;"Steve Miller's publishing catalog, far more valuable."
02:56;03:00;"That kind of sounds a little bit like an American psycho speech."
03:00;03:04;"Which leads us to a little bit of news. I guess people probably know by now,"
03:04;03:09;"but today we got another guest. This is turning into Jimmy Fallon."
03:09;03:13;"Today, we're also very lucky to have Huey Lewis coming through. Pretty amazing."
03:13;03:17;"And for people who don't know, there's a very famous part of American Psycho,"
03:17;03:21;"the book and the film, where Patrick Bateman goes on about how much he likes"
03:21;03:24;"Huey Lewis and gives one of his classic speeches about pop music."
03:24;03:28;"And I can kind of picture that about Steve Miller and the Grateful Dead."
03:28;03:31;"Anyway, he'll be in here in a little while, but before that,"
03:31;03:35;"Jake missed the last episode too. I mean, you're on it, but you're up in Canada."
03:35;03:38;"Called in. The whole crew is gone. Crazy."
03:38;03:41;"So we got a lot to catch up on, actually. Yeah, man. Great to see you."
03:41;03:43;"In our world. Great to see you too. Last time I saw--"
03:43;03:47;"I missed you both. I missed you too, Seinfeld."
03:47;03:50;"Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there too."
03:50;03:52;"All sorts of fun stuff's been happening."
03:52;03:55;"I mean, first of all, this already feels like a while ago,"
03:55;03:57;"but we finally had the Hollywood Bowl show."
03:57;03:59;"Last time I saw you, I think. That's true."
03:59;04:02;"So the Vampire Weekend Hollywood Bowl show happened"
04:02;04:05;"with openers Tinarowin and Richard Pictures."
04:05;04:07;"Great night. It finally happened."
04:07;04:10;"I mean, I think we announced it nine months ago."
04:10;04:15;"We've been talking about that show on this show for, yeah, at least eight or nine months."
04:15;04:18;"It happened. It was a beautiful night in Los Angeles."
04:18;04:21;"Sold-out concert at one of America's premier venues."
04:21;04:24;"How did it feel for RP? Felt great."
04:24;04:26;"I think we played really well."
04:26;04:30;"We had a tight five-song set, which we squeezed into 30 minutes exactly,"
04:30;04:32;"which was our allotted time."
04:32;04:34;"Did you open with ""He's Gone""? Yeah. Nice."
04:34;04:38;"Did you catch the set at all? Yeah, I think I watched the first half, basically."
04:38;04:43;"A lot of people missed it because they underestimated the traffic getting in."
04:43;04:45;"That's the thing. And I tried to warn people."
04:45;04:49;"You pay a high price. Hollywood Bowl is a beautiful open-air venue"
04:49;04:52;"in the heart of the second biggest city in America."
04:52;04:55;"It's tough getting in, but once you're in-- But you pay a high price."
04:55;04:59;"Actually, I gave not a speech. Lately, I don't talk that much on stage."
04:59;05:02;"I kind of noticed that. I was sort of like, ""No banter tonight."""
05:02;05:04;"You know, I never had that much banter, is the truth."
05:04;05:07;"Although the one thing is that when you only say two or three things,"
05:07;05:11;"you guarantee that in any write-up, they're going to dwell on it."
05:11;05:13;"[laughs]"
05:13;05:15;"If you're like, ""Man, we haven't been here in a long time,"""
05:15;05:17;"they just--whatever. They focus on it."
05:17;05:22;"But every once in a while, I'll tell a story if it feels truly appropriate."
05:22;05:26;"Here's one. In Seattle, that was the week before the Hollywood Bowl,"
05:26;05:30;"I was walking around in this neighborhood, Capitol Hill."
05:30;05:33;"Seattle's bananas, by the way. I hadn't been there in a while."
05:33;05:36;"I love the weather, so I'm very pro-Seattle."
05:36;05:39;"It's beautiful. You can see the water and stuff."
05:39;05:42;"But just in terms of how the downtown has changed,"
05:42;05:45;"when people talk about Silicon Valley and San Francisco,"
05:45;05:49;"it's like Seattle actually looks like what they're describing"
05:49;05:52;"because there's parts of Seattle that are just so Amazon'd out."
05:52;05:55;"You're kind of just like--I might have the companies wrong."
05:55;05:58;"It's probably Amazon plus three or four other tech companies"
05:58;06:00;"and law firms or whatever."
06:00;06:02;"But I was walking around a certain neighborhood, and I was like,"
06:02;06:06;"""I know this is technically just the space of the city,"
06:06;06:10;"free space where anyone can come, but this feels like a campus."""
06:10;06:13;"It's so deep, so much Amazon stuff going on,"
06:13;06:16;"just people with lanyards everywhere."
06:16;06:18;"I was kind of like, ""Am I at a conference"
06:18;06:22;"or am I just in a deeply Amazon'd out neighborhood?"""
06:22;06:24;"And there are just cranes in the sky."
06:24;06:28;"Solange. Just cranes in the sky everywhere, building luxury apartments."
06:28;06:32;"It's true when you drive through Silicon Valley just on the 101 there,"
06:32;06:34;"you don't actually see that much."
06:34;06:36;"You'll see a few glass office buildings,"
06:36;06:40;"but it doesn't make an impression really, visually."
06:40;06:44;"I'm sure if you were at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino,"
06:44;06:47;"you'd be like, ""Okay, this is a Silicon Valley-esque place."""
06:47;06:50;"But San Francisco itself--I don't know."
06:50;06:52;"It still looks like San Francisco."
06:52;06:55;"Yeah, so this part of downtown Seattle, I was just like, ""Damn."""

14:14;14:16;"- You're listening to..."
14:16;14:18;"- Time Crisis."
14:18;14:20;"- On Beat One."
14:20;14:21;"- Oh, but the thing I was gonna say that I--"
14:21;14:23;"my little thing that I wanted to say at the Hollywood Bowl,"
14:23;14:27;"'cause we went to a concert a couple weeks before our show."
14:27;14:28;"- Yeah."
14:28;14:30;"- Rashida took me to the Nas/Mary J. Blige concert."
14:30;14:32;"- At the Bowl. - At the Bowl."
14:32;14:34;"- Tight. - And again,"
14:34;14:37;"bowl traffic's gnarly, and Trump was in town that night."
14:37;14:40;"- Yikes. - Just messing s--t up even worse."
14:40;14:42;"Bad vibes. So we got there right in time"
14:42;14:44;"to catch the very end of Nas' set"
14:44;14:46;"before Mary J. went on,"
14:46;14:48;"and I noticed two things about the Bowl."
14:48;14:50;"One, it's such a nightmare to get in there,"
14:50;14:52;"but once you're there, you have to just, like,"
14:52;14:54;"let all the stress of getting there go,"
14:54;14:56;"'cause now you're in a concert. Like, what are you gonna do?"
14:56;14:58;"Hold on to that, and then the whole show's ruined?"
14:58;15:00;"So I was like--I made a mental note."
15:00;15:02;"I was like, you know, just give--show people"
15:02;15:04;"a little respect for their journey."
15:04;15:06;"And then the other thing I noticed was that the Bowl's so big"
15:06;15:08;"that the people in the back sometimes sound like"
15:08;15:11;"they're watching a concert from, like, a distant canyon."
15:11;15:14;"Just, like, 'cause we were up front in the boxes,"
15:14;15:16;"and I just hear this, like, roar in the back."
15:16;15:18;"So those are my two things. So when I did one little moment"
15:18;15:21;"at the show where I said, ""Just, you know, very quickly,"
15:21;15:23;"""I know it's very stressful to get here."
15:23;15:25;"Take a deep breath. We're here. Good vibes."""
15:25;15:28;"And then I also made sure to show the back some love,"
15:28;15:32;"'cause I want to let all the one-percenters in the boxes"
15:32;15:35;"just, like, hear the roar of humanity in the back."
15:35;15:38;"We're all in this together. 'Cause truly, I'd be like,"
15:38;15:40;"""Back, make some noise!"" And it would just sound like..."
15:40;15:44;"[deep, deep, deep roar]"
15:44;15:46;"I think it's a good vibe in the back, too, actually."
15:46;15:49;"I walked up to the back during the show."
15:49;15:50;"Yeah? Was it a good vibe?"
15:50;15:53;"Loved it. People were all standing. They were loving it."
15:53;15:55;"Walked to the back during your sound check, too."
15:55;15:56;"Oh, yeah."
15:56;15:59;"Which was amazing. I'd never been up there before."
15:59;16:02;"And, like, the view during the day, you can see the Hollywood sign."
16:02;16:03;"It's wild up there."
16:03;16:05;"You know what, actually, Will, the keyboardist..."
16:05;16:06;"Yeah."
16:06;16:07;"Our keyboardist, Will, told me,"
16:07;16:11;"""You can go to the Hollywood Bowl for free during the day"
16:11;16:14;"""when, like, the symphony or the Philharmonic or whatever is practicing."""
16:14;16:15;"Hmm."
16:15;16:17;"So you could go there. You know, it's gonna be hot as hell."
16:17;16:18;"Yeah."
16:18;16:21;"But maybe, depending on the time of year, you know, throw a big hat on,"
16:21;16:23;"and you could probably hike around and listen to them,"
16:23;16:25;"and it's, like, a cool, free thing to do."
16:25;16:26;"Yeah."
16:26;16:28;"Yeah, so I thought the Hollywood Bowl was a good vibe."
16:28;16:29;"Yeah, we had a great time."
16:29;16:31;"I mean, I know what you mean about the banter,"
16:31;16:34;"'cause, like, people were like, ""Oh, like, how was it playing the bowl?"
16:34;16:35;"""Was it insane?"""
16:35;16:39;"And I was like, ""Well, I was just really trying to focus on doing my parts"
16:39;16:41;"""as correctly as I possibly could."""
16:41;16:46;"I didn't really have the mental bandwidth to, like, revel in the bowl."
16:46;16:48;"'Cause we're not used to playing-- you know, like, we're a bar band."
16:48;16:51;"We're not used to playing huge venues."
16:51;16:54;"And so I was just, like, very, like, kind of, like, inward"
16:54;16:57;"and just, like, kind of staring into, like, the middle distance"
16:57;16:59;"and just, like, focusing or had my eyes closed."
16:59;17:01;"And so I couldn't even imagine at that point being like,"
17:01;17:02;"""Hey, what's up?"""
17:02;17:04;"""What's up, everybody?"""
17:04;17:06;"It's just, like, a funny, like, 40-second anecdote now."
17:06;17:11;"Well, yeah, and also because, like, the music can get big reactions, you know?"
17:11;17:12;"Yeah."
17:12;17:14;"So then it's, like, every once in a while, you'd be like, ""How you feeling?"""
17:14;17:16;"You know, just to let people know that you care"
17:16;17:20;"and give everybody something-- like, a simple way to communicate."
17:20;17:21;"Yeah."
17:21;17:22;"""What's up?"""
17:22;17:23;"I feel like you need a little something."
17:23;17:25;"It is weird when you go to a show and, like, there's, like,"
17:25;17:26;"never one word said."
17:26;17:27;"That is intense."
17:27;17:28;"No, I always say something."
17:28;17:29;"Yeah."
17:29;17:31;"But I would almost want to make it a moment or something"
17:31;17:34;"where I'd be like-- that's why I also like that now we basically do"
17:34;17:36;"the request section every--"
17:36;17:37;"Yeah, that was cool."
17:37;17:40;"--during every encore because that's also a moment when,"
17:40;17:43;"whether there was an anecdote earlier or just a lot of, like,"
17:43;17:46;"""What's up? Thank you, Seattle,"" whatever,"
17:46;17:49;"even if we hadn't talked that much, that's the moment where I feel like"
17:49;17:51;"it loosens up and we're just like, ""All right, what's up?"""
17:51;17:53;"And you kind of feel like we're all just people hanging out,"
17:53;17:55;"like, ""Let's come up with a song to play together."
17:55;17:56;"What you got?"""
17:56;17:57;"Yeah."
17:57;17:58;"""All in All the Bowls"" is a success."
17:58;17:59;"We had Heidecker in the building."
17:59;18:00;"Right, friend of the show."
18:00;18:01;"Friend of the show."
18:01;18:02;"Tim Heidecker."
18:02;18:04;"Also, shout-out to his new movie, Mr. America."
18:04;18:05;"I haven't seen it yet."
18:05;18:08;"It's great, and I'm a huge fan of the franchise."
18:08;18:10;"[laughter]"
18:10;18:12;"The on-cinema universe."
18:12;18:15;"And then pretty soon after that, we wrapped up the tour at Red Rocks--"
18:15;18:16;"Right."
18:16;18:21;"--where we debuted the Vampire Weekend cover of your song ""Mountain Bruise."""
18:21;18:22;"Unbelievable."
18:22;18:23;"We've been talking about that for a while."
18:23;18:25;"I can't remember, did we talk about that on the show?"
18:25;18:27;"Made my week, dude."
18:27;18:28;"I'm glad to hear it."
18:28;18:30;"It's great playing it."
18:30;18:33;"I don't think we talked about it on the show, but I remember you mentioning, like,"
18:33;18:37;"""Hey, I sent 'Mountain Bruise' to the whole band to learn,"" and I was like, ""Really?"""
18:37;18:38;"[laughter]"
18:38;18:40;"I was like, ""Cool. I hope that happens."""
18:40;18:41;"I really like it."
18:41;18:43;"I mean, I always liked it as a song."
18:43;18:44;"Actually, dude, at the Bowl--"
18:44;18:45;"Yeah."
18:45;18:46;"--when I walked into the top of the--"
18:46;18:47;"Oh, we were sound-checking."
18:47;18:48;"Yeah, you sound-checked with ""Bruise,"" and I was like--"
18:48;18:51;"Like, me and the whole band were just like, ""Wow."""
18:51;18:52;"Yeah."
18:52;18:53;"This is--"
18:53;18:54;"Yeah, that was the first time we tried it."
18:54;18:56;"Yeah, it sounded incredible there."
18:56;19:00;"And then the day after the Red Rock show, luckily someone YouTubed it."
19:00;19:02;"Oh, yeah. I also got footage of it."
19:02;19:04;"We sent out some of our crew to make sure that we got footage."
19:04;19:06;"Oh, cool. I haven't seen that yet."
19:06;19:09;"We could do a whole edit of, like, a few of the different angles."
19:09;19:13;"I got to send you the one that our crew got because it's a little more, like, front of house from, like, the center."
19:13;19:14;"Cool."
19:14;19:19;"And you can see just, like, one dude who's kind of just, like, hippie dance, and he's just, like, so into it."
19:19;19:21;"He kind of tells the whole story."
19:21;19:22;"I can't remember when I came up with the idea."
19:22;19:31;"I think part of it was from getting deeper into Phish, honestly, because I was thinking about the different levels of covers that exist in a band's catalog."
19:31;19:32;"Mm-hmm."
19:32;19:36;"Where it's like, yeah, you just bust out, like, a famous song, and it's kind of like, all right."
19:36;19:37;"Cool."
19:37;19:40;"Yeah, cool. You covered whatever, ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears or whatever."
19:40;19:41;"Yeah."
19:41;19:42;"Kind of fun, kind of random."
19:42;19:49;"And then there's, like, covers of, you know, maybe well-known songs, but you cover it so much that there's a history of it being your thing."
19:49;19:53;"And then there's, like, this other category where it's like, you cover, like, a friend's song."
19:53;19:54;"Right."
19:54;19:59;"That's, like, the most interesting category in a way because it's--you're not just, like, reaching out into pop culture."
19:59;20:01;"It's like somebody that's, like, part of the family."
20:01;20:05;"There's, like, a story there besides just, you know, we thought it'd be cool to cover ""Peace Frog."""
20:05;20:06;"Right."
20:06;20:12;"I always thought that ""Mountain Breeze"" would be the perfect type of song, but when to do it was an important consideration."
20:12;20:17;"Because I do kind of like that, as of now, it's only been performed in Mountain Time."
20:17;20:18;"[laughs]"
20:18;20:19;"That was a few episodes ago."
20:19;20:22;"We were talking about Mountain Time being the most interesting time zone."
20:22;20:24;"And going forward, only in Mountain Time."
20:24;20:25;"Only in Boise."
20:25;20:26;"Well, yeah."
20:26;20:27;"Only in Missoula."
20:27;20:30;"Because we got that mountain run coming up with Twiddle next year."
20:30;20:32;"Although I kind of want to play it."
20:32;20:33;"Well, okay."
20:33;20:34;"I love the version."
20:34;20:36;"I was honestly very touched that you guys did it."
20:36;20:37;"It sounded amazing."
20:37;20:42;"I love the breakdown because the song's, like, you know, like on the little EP, it's like four minutes maybe."
20:42;20:45;"Although there's a lot of jamming in the studio recording, too."
20:45;20:46;"Yeah, there is."
20:46;20:47;"Like, yeah, it kind of, like, you know, goes on at the end."
20:47;20:51;"But you guys did, like, a solid, like, what, like, six and a half minute version?"
20:51;20:53;"And it kind of gets, like, real gentle."
20:53;20:59;"I don't have the board recording of the Red Rocks performance, but I do have the SLC sound check, which I sent to you."
20:59;21:02;"This is so, like, deep VW heads."
21:02;21:05;"Like, dude, you got the board tapes from the SLC sound check?"
21:05;21:06;"SLC sound check."
21:06;21:07;"That was also something that--"
21:07;21:09;"Like, weird CD-R, like, SLC sound check."
21:09;21:12;"I knew we needed to work on it in the SLC sound check."
21:12;21:17;"And then our tour manager was, like, the place we played in SLC, it's, like, a venue."
21:17;21:21;"But when they do, like, a bigger outdoor show, they just, like, set up a stage in the parking lot."
21:21;21:26;"So, you know, there were, like, 10, 15 people already waiting by the gate."
21:26;21:32;"And so at first, it was, like, well, okay, you know, if you do sound check, if you do, like, a real sound check, people are going to be able to hear it."
21:32;21:35;"And then there was, like, do you want us to shut off the PA or something?"
21:35;21:37;"We just kind of looked at each other, like, no, that's cool."
21:37;21:38;"Yeah."
21:38;21:40;"Let them hear us working on Mountain Bruce."
21:40;21:43;"So this is the SLC sound check board recording."
21:43;21:47;"You know, just to be full disclosure, this is truly--we have played it at the Bowl."
21:47;21:49;"This is us working on it for the first time."
21:49;21:51;"So, like, you know, it's loose."
21:51;21:53;"Just want to give people a little taste."
21:55;21:57;"Time Crisis."
21:57;21:58;"This is the Time Crisis."
21:58;21:59;"Sweet Chili Heat."
21:59;22:02;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere, brought to you by Doritos."
22:02;22:04;"Sweet Chili Heat."
22:06;22:08;"I think the Bowl was instrumental."
22:08;22:09;"Right."
22:09;22:13;"But Baio sent this out to everybody just to work on, and I was like, you know what?"
22:13;22:16;"This is not bad."
22:16;22:19;"In the parking lot of the Complex in Salt Lake City."
22:24;22:29;"♪ Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike? ♪"
22:29;22:35;"♪ Be there to trail that light around the corner of the street ♪"

23:03;23:05;"♪ Mountain blues ♪"
23:05;23:09;"Everybody in the band was talking about how they had it stuck in their head for, like, weeks."

23:34;23:35;"Brian's crushing."
23:35;23:38;"This is probably the first time he ever, like, fully ripped a solo over it."
23:45;23:50;"Did you catch how in the Red Rocks version, he did a little Harmony Hall moment?"
23:50;23:52;"I'll have to look at that."
24:03;24:05;"Ooh, Will just hit it hard."
24:05;24:10;"Everybody's, I don't know, like, A-O-C-T, Gary, everybody sounds great."
24:10;24:11;"Greta and Will on the harmonies."
24:11;24:13;"This is a big bass song."
24:13;24:14;"Yeah, yeah."
24:17;24:18;"Add a little voice crack."
24:18;24:19;"Right."
24:29;24:30;"CT doing that drum fill."
24:30;24:31;"Yeah."
24:50;24:52;"Oh, yeah, the me how I do the harmony, I love playing this."
25:01;25:02;"Shout out to John for writing those riffs."
25:02;25:04;"Oh, yeah, great."
25:04;25:05;"Classic John."
25:05;25:06;"Yeah."
25:06;25:10;"It was a little bit of a bummer because I love playing this part,"
25:10;25:13;"and I think we did, this is the first time we did it, and it was like,"
25:13;25:17;"it felt like it went pretty well, but then by the time we were playing"
25:17;25:20;"Mountain Bruise at Red Rocks, it was in the 30s."
25:20;25:21;"That's insane."
25:21;25:22;"And wet."
25:22;25:23;"It was late in the set, right?"
25:23;25:24;"Yeah, yeah."
25:30;25:35;"Actually, speaking of banter, you do a nice little piece of banter before the --"
25:35;25:36;"Yeah, well, I felt --"
25:36;25:38;"A little context."
25:38;25:40;"[Humming]"
25:40;25:43;"Yeah, this is sick."
25:43;25:44;"Yeah, Will takes over."
25:48;25:51;"Yeah, if we want to do like an eight-minute bruise,"
25:51;25:53;"we just extend this part a little bit."
25:53;25:55;"Easy."
25:55;25:56;"Go minor."
25:56;25:58;"[Laughter]"
25:58;26:00;"But --"
26:02;26:06;"That was the thing about the Red Rocks show, night one was like kind of like a"
26:06;26:10;"beautiful, like high 50s, low 60s kind of atmosphere."
26:10;26:11;"Yeah."
26:11;26:12;"Dry."
26:12;26:16;"Night two was the biggest, I forget, I think it was the biggest temperature"
26:16;26:20;"drop in Colorado October history."
26:20;26:23;"So it was like about 80 during the day, like sunny."
26:23;26:24;"Yeah."
26:24;26:27;"And then by night it hit 32 low."
26:27;26:28;"Wow."
26:29;26:30;"There's like a tiny bit of snow."
26:30;26:33;"So we go out, it's like everybody's dressed pretty warmly,"
26:33;26:35;"but I usually still get a little bit nervous about the audience."
26:35;26:38;"Also, before we went on night two at Red Rocks,"
26:38;26:40;"I'm like sitting and catering with everybody,"
26:40;26:43;"and like the team comes in and they're like, ""Okay, guys,"
26:43;26:45;"currently we got winds above 40."
26:45;26:49;"We're going to like strap down a lot of the stuff and we're going to hold doors,"
26:49;26:52;"and if the winds don't abate, can't put you on stage, too dangerous,"
26:52;26:55;"if we get below 20 miles per hour, we can do the show."""
26:55;26:58;"So I was like, ""Damn, really about to like cancel this show?"""
26:58;27:00;"They're like, ""We're telling people to go back to their cars."""
27:00;27:01;"Wow."
27:04;27:09;"♪ Mountain blues ♪"
27:09;27:12;"♪ Sweetest morning blues ♪"
27:12;27:14;"[Laughter]"
27:14;27:16;"Big kick back in there."
27:18;27:21;"Well, it's funny. You guys end this song really well."
27:21;27:26;"We played it once in Ojai, and we forgot how we decided to end it."
27:26;27:29;"So we had one of those classic like everyone's looking at each other,"
27:29;27:31;"like how are we going to end this?"
27:31;27:32;"This is actually an edit."
27:32;27:34;"You know, we took a minute to figure it out,"
27:34;27:36;"so when Bayo sent it out, he did an edit"
27:36;27:39;"so that we'd remember the rhythm we decided on, which is..."
27:39;27:41;"[Singing]"
27:41;27:43;"Yeah, so going into night two at Red Rocks, already it was kind of like,"
27:43;27:45;"""Damn, is this show even going to happen?"""
27:45;27:48;"And then because, you know, we've been playing long,"
27:48;27:51;"because that's the way of our vibe, but now, you know,"
27:51;27:54;"people spend their hard-earned cash coming to see VW."
27:54;27:56;"We're not going to hit them with a 75-minute show."
27:56;27:57;"Hell no."
27:57;27:59;"And that was the last night of tour, and we had--"
27:59;28:01;"technically, we had-- Soccer Mommy was opening."
28:01;28:03;"Great band, by the way."
28:03;28:07;"Our allotted time was 8-- started at 8.15, hard curfew at 11."
28:07;28:09;"So we're like, ""Should we just do this?"
28:09;28:11;"Should we just do a full 2.45?"""
28:11;28:14;"So the last night of tour, Red Rocks, let's, like, load this set up."
28:14;28:15;"Kick it out."
28:15;28:17;"So we work on the set list."
28:17;28:18;"God, that rules."
28:18;28:21;"And it's also-- we did, I think, hit our record."
28:21;28:24;"At the Garden, we technically played 32 songs."
28:24;28:27;"If you count these, like, snippets of requests,"
28:27;28:31;"which maybe you shouldn't, at Red Rocks night two, we played 35 songs."
28:31;28:34;"But if you get rid of those half songs, still 33."
28:34;28:36;"Still takes the record."
28:36;28:38;"So we were kind of like, ""We got to do this. We got to hit the record."""
28:38;28:40;"And at first, we go out, and we're like, ""Oh, it's cold."""
28:40;28:42;"I was wearing this whole, like, fleece outfit, and I was like,"
28:42;28:45;"""You know what? It's cold, but it's, like, you know, cozy in a way."""
28:45;28:49;"And then, like, halfway through, it just got a little wet,"
28:49;28:51;"and my fingers really started to feel [bleep] up,"
28:51;28:54;"and I was just like, ""Okay. This is like--"""
28:54;28:55;"And I talked with the band later."
28:55;28:57;"Everybody had a moment where they were, like,"
28:57;28:59;"wondered if we should, like, go into a huddle and be like,"
28:59;29:01;"""Let's cut nine songs."""
29:01;29:02;"Right."
29:02;29:03;"But then, you know, it would get really cold,"
29:03;29:06;"and then we'd just, like, go back up, like, 7 degrees."
29:06;29:08;"Whoa. So a crazy cold front coming in."
29:08;29:09;"Yeah."
29:09;29:10;"Wow."
29:10;29:12;"It was super dry, too, until we got a little bit of rain"
29:12;29:13;"and a little bit of snow."
29:13;29:14;"Jesus."
29:14;29:15;"So towards the end--"
29:15;29:16;"It was like a weird NFL game."
29:16;29:18;"It kind of felt that way."
29:18;29:19;"And so towards the end, I'm like--"
29:19;29:21;"So I made sure a couple times just to say, like,"
29:21;29:25;"""Listen, if you didn't dress properly, like, do what you got to do."""
29:25;29:26;"I didn't quite say, ""Go home."""
29:26;29:29;"I was just like, you know, ""Whatever you need to go stand in the bathroom"
29:29;29:31;"for a while, go get a drink."""
29:31;29:33;"I don't want our audience getting hypothermia."
29:33;29:34;"Yeah."
29:34;29:36;"You saw people just fully, like, suited up for winter."
29:36;29:37;"I mean, it's Colorado,"
29:37;29:40;"but I also knew a lot of out-of-towners come to Red Rocks."
29:40;29:43;"So I, you know, just picture somebody who, like, glanced at the weather"
29:43;29:46;"and like, ""Oh, 80. It'll get a little colder at night."""
29:46;29:47;"Some idiot from L.A."
29:47;29:49;"Yeah."
29:49;29:51;"I was like, ""I don't want that blood on my hands."""
29:51;29:55;"But it was funny because, you know, the way we do a set list is like,"
29:55;30:00;"of course we're going to have these runs of, you know, singles and classic songs,"
30:00;30:02;"you know, often in the beginning and then later,"
30:02;30:05;"but then you're going to have your stretch-out moments."
30:05;30:08;"We did our 10-minute Joker Man in the same show."
30:08;30:10;"That is so sick."
30:10;30:11;"10 minutes."
30:11;30:12;"Yeah."
30:12;30:16;"As we got deeper into the set, and I'm kind of like looking at what's coming up,"
30:16;30:17;"you know, we mix it up."
30:17;30:20;"It's like we're never hitting people with, like, deep cuts,"
30:20;30:24;"but I'm like, ""Okay, Joker Man. Wow. All right."
30:24;30:27;"About to hit Joker Man,"" because, you know, you kind of forget when you're on stage."
30:27;30:29;"And then I was like, ""All right, let's do this."""
30:29;30:32;"And then right around the time I see Mountain Bruise on the set,"
30:32;30:34;"it was just so cold."
30:34;30:38;"So I was just like, you know, my dream was kind of just like beautiful night at Red Rocks"
30:38;30:42;"and just be like everybody just huddled up having like feeling awesome"
30:42;30:44;"and then just being like, ""Hey, guys, I want to tell you about a song."
30:44;30:46;"Some of you might know it. Some of you probably don't."""
30:46;30:50;"But instead it's just like, yeah, like NFL game freezing."
30:50;30:56;"So I really want to make sure to set it up so that people felt like had some context for the song."
30:56;30:59;"I feel like the more unpleasant the atmosphere is, like the weather,"
30:59;31:01;"the more you like need to know what's happening."
31:01;31:03;"Yeah. Feel involved."
31:03;31:06;"Yeah. And I also felt like I wanted to tell them what the chorus was ahead of time"
31:06;31:08;"so that they could really appreciate it."
31:08;31:10;"Guys, like we're up in the mountains."
31:10;31:13;"Some of you are probably holding on to a brew right now."
31:13;31:18;"This is a song that our buddy wrote about going for a hike and drinking a brew, a mountain brew."
31:18;31:20;"So I wanted them to understand."
31:20;31:23;"And, you know, we had a few TC heads in the crowd"
31:23;31:26;"because you met some people after and people reached out."
31:26;31:29;"So I really wonder what percentage of the crowd knew the song."
31:29;31:32;"In one of the videos, I almost felt like I could hear somebody singing along."
31:32;31:36;"Well, I posted about it on my Instagram and there were a lot of comments"
31:36;31:40;"and a lot of people were like, I was there last night. It ruled."
31:40;31:45;"Oh, tight. And then on the comments on the YouTube, which is classic TC bit,"
31:45;31:49;"people were like, I was there. This rules like, you know, like. Right."
31:49;31:55;"It's kind of an interesting case study in like what percentage of the VW audience is also part of the TCU."
31:55;31:58;"Right. But people were like people around me knew it like. Interesting."
31:58;32:05;"Yeah. The TCU, as discussed, is a kind of an elite secret society within the larger vampire fan base."
32:05;32:09;"I feel like we talked about this a long time ago. This probably before we went on tour."
32:09;32:12;"It was like the idea of just like TC heads."
32:12;32:18;"Maybe they got some bootleg merch or something and just kind of being part of the larger crowd at a VW show"
32:18;32:22;"and kind of seeing each other and get like the head nod, like kind of secret society vibe."
32:22;32:26;"Just like the handshake. Jedi's. Just like fellow TC head."
32:26;32:32;"Good to see you. But I definitely feel like that song won people over, too."
32:32;32:35;"That's why I was glad that we like set it up so people weren't just like, wait, do I know this?"
32:35;32:41;"I think that's the thing. You don't want people sitting there for too long being like, wait, do I know this?"
32:41;32:43;"What is this? Do I know this? Like, because then you're not just enjoying it."
32:43;32:46;"I think if you're straight up or like you don't know this song. Yeah."
32:46;32:49;"But here's the story of the song that it's like, OK, I'm going to take it in."
32:49;32:53;"It got kind of like a big reaction at the end. I felt like people were won over."
32:53;32:58;"And also thrilled to hear that Colorado is like jam country to hell. Yeah."
32:58;33:02;"Not like L.A. exactly. Colorado would fall flat at the bowl."
33:02;33:05;"Let's be honest. Colorado is very fertile jam country."
33:05;33:08;"But shout out to Kyle from String Cheese, who was in the building."
33:08;33:11;"Oh, wow. We didn't get to chop it up much afterwards."
33:11;33:16;"Could I ask him if he caught Bruce? Got to have him on the show sometime."
33:16;33:23;"Yeah. So anyway, it was a great performance. Check out the YouTube of Mount and Bruce live at Red Rocks."
33:23;33:27;"Oh, yeah. I was a little bit bummed because I just felt like everybody else sounded great."
33:27;33:31;"I just felt like I personally didn't nail my guitar parts as well as I had at the SLC sound check."
33:31;33:36;"You nailed it, dude. We'll do more. And all in all, it was a successful performance."
33:36;33:41;"And whatever fears I had going into Mount and Bruce and, you know, 30 something degree weather and it was wet."
33:41;33:44;"I was like, you know, that's what it's all about. You could have easily cut it."
33:44;33:48;"I'm honored that you didn't. That would have been f**ked up, man."
33:48;33:52;"And anyway, Mount and Bruce wasn't even, you know, we still probably had another like eight or nine songs."
33:52;34:00;"It was so deep. I think by the time we were truly like two hours and 40 minutes deep, we were in the encore."
34:00;34:04;"I think at the encore break, we lost a significant number of people, which I totally understand."
34:04;34:10;"It was like it was borderline brutal. I mean, I guess the only thing that I could say is like the audience on the one hand,"
34:10;34:15;"they're more exposed a little bit, but they also can have their hands in their pockets."
34:15;34:20;"So, right. You know, I mean, but still it was a significant number of people made it to the bitter end."
34:20;34:26;"So shout out to the Red Rocks crowd. All right. Well, I think it's time."
34:26;34:31;"Bring in rock legend Huey Lewis. I kind of can't believe we're about to meet him for the first time."
34:31;34:36;"Incredible. That's another thing the TC heads should know. I guess with Justin, we determined we hadn't met before,"
34:36;34:41;"but we're really meeting on air. This is big. This is big. All right. Stay tuned."
34:41;34:50;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
34:50;34:53;"This your rule."
34:53;35:00;"New York, New York is everything you say and no place that I'd rather be."
35:00;35:07;"Where else can you do a half a million things all at a quarter to three?"
35:07;35:13;"When they play their music, ooh, that modern music, they rock it with a lot of style."
35:13;35:20;"But it's still that same old back beat rhythm that really, really drives them wild."
35:20;35:27;"They say the harder on the road is to be, and from what I've seen, I believe 'em."
35:27;35:36;"Now the old one may be barely breathing, but the harder rock and roll, harder rock and roll's to be done."
35:36;35:48;"L.A., Hollywood and the Sunset Strip is something everyone should see."
35:48;35:55;"Neon lights and the pretty, pretty girls all dress so scantily."
35:55;36:01;"When they play their music, that hard rock music, they rock it with a lot of flash."
36:01;36:08;"But it's still that same old back beat rhythm that really, really keeps them in the..."
36:08;36:15;"They say the harder on the road is to be, and from what I've seen, I believe 'em."
36:15;36:24;"Now the old one may be barely breathing, but the harder rock and roll, harder rock and roll's to be done."
36:25;36:27;"Johnny!"
36:27;36:29;"Ow!"
36:29;36:35;"Do you know, would you like a white clawed, sparkling, alcoholized seltzer that's all the rage?"
36:35;36:36;"How did you know?"
36:36;36:37;"I don't know."
36:37;36:39;"That's exactly what I want."
36:39;36:40;"Alright, cool."
36:40;36:41;"Are you serious?"
36:41;36:42;"Yeah, here we go."
36:42;36:45;"That's the perfect beginning to the interview. Alright, I guess I'll have one too."
36:45;36:47;"It's a white clawed, hard seltzer."
36:47;36:49;"Have you heard of white clawed before?"
36:49;36:50;"No."
36:50;36:55;"So believe it or not, apparently this is outselling Budweiser."
36:55;36:56;"Seriously?"
36:56;36:58;"Yeah, in fact, I had heard..."
36:58;37:00;"I'm sure it's better than Budweiser, to be honest."
37:00;37:01;"It is."
37:01;37:04;"Budweiser's probably, now I'm gonna get killed."
37:04;37:08;"But, I don't know, I have beer, but I like German, good German lagers."
37:08;37:11;"Yeah, you're right, it's not that hard to beat Bud."
37:11;37:12;"Mmm."
37:12;37:13;"But..."
37:13;37:14;"Wow."
37:14;37:15;"It's only 100 calories."
37:15;37:16;"What do you think?"
37:16;37:18;"It's good. It's really good."
37:18;37:21;"Well, that's a hell of a way to start this, Huey Lewis' first white claw."
37:21;37:23;"It won't be my last."
37:23;37:24;"Alright."
37:24;37:25;"It's good."
37:25;37:27;"So, I mean, man, so much to talk about."
37:27;37:30;"You're an absolute legend, great to have you."
37:30;37:31;"Let's start at the top."
37:31;37:33;"One thing that I've been kind of interested in is..."
37:33;37:35;"I want to talk a little bit about the early days."
37:35;37:37;"So, you were born in New York."
37:37;37:39;"You're not particularly associated with New York."
37:39;37:41;"Obviously, you sing about it here and there."
37:41;37:43;"But you didn't really, like, grow up in the city."
37:43;37:45;"You grew up in the Bay."
37:45;37:47;"Yeah, I was born in Manhattan."
37:47;37:49;"We moved at 5-year-old."
37:49;37:51;"Went through Ohio for a moment."
37:51;37:52;"Left New York."
37:52;37:54;"Didn't like the sandboxes very much."
37:54;37:56;"They were, you know, so 2 years old I left there."
37:56;37:57;"Yeah."
37:57;37:59;"I went to Ohio for--"
37:59;38:02;"where my dad was a research radiologist for 3 years."
38:02;38:03;"Then we moved to California."
38:03;38:05;"Okay, so you're a true Marin OG."
38:05;38:07;"I was raised since '55 in Marin County."
38:07;38:11;"So you were there before the hippies, before the techies."
38:11;38:13;"Before the Grateful Dead were in Marin County."
38:13;38:14;"Right."
38:14;38:17;"So, you're like Jaden Smith in Calabasas."
38:17;38:20;"Are you aware of how Calabasas is like everybody lives there now?"
38:20;38:21;"Yeah, that's good."
38:21;38:22;"'Cause Jaden's a friend of mine."
38:22;38:23;"We've worked together."
38:23;38:26;"And I was talking to him about that he basically grew up in Calabasas."
38:26;38:29;"And now you got Kanye and Drake and all these famous people living there."
38:29;38:33;"When your family moved there, were there so many, like, prominent musicians?"
38:33;38:34;"He's like, ""No, not at all."""
38:34;38:38;"And I was like, ""You're really the original Calabasas prince."""
38:38;38:40;"So you really witnessed a pretty incredible time."
38:40;38:43;"I have an uncle who grew up also in the '50s and hate Ashbery."
38:43;38:48;"And when he talks about the changes from when he was a little kid to the '60s and beyond,"
38:48;38:52;"it's probably one of the most dramatic transformations in all of America."
38:52;38:53;"No question."
38:53;38:56;"It was a completely blue-collar place when I went to school."
38:56;39:00;"None of the people I went to grade school with were doctors or lawyers or any of that."
39:00;39:02;"They were all contractors."
39:02;39:09;"And it was completely blue-collar until '66, summer love, '67, and just got--blew up."
39:09;39:11;"So you were kind of like perfect timing for all this."
39:11;39:18;"So essentially as you became a teenager and a young adult living in the Bay Area was also, you know,"
39:18;39:21;"if you're going to San Francisco era, the hippies showing up."
39:21;39:24;"And that, I imagine, is right around the time you became a musician?"
39:24;39:27;"We were a little young for that."
39:27;39:29;"I was sort of 13, 14, 15."
39:29;39:32;"When I was 16 was--I was born in 1950."
39:32;39:33;"Yeah."
39:33;39:38;"So the summer love '66, we were 16, and we couldn't quite drive."
39:38;39:39;"We didn't have total freedom yet."
39:39;39:40;"Yeah."
39:40;39:44;"Our older brothers, and in some cases, my case, my mother, for example,"
39:44;39:47;"was way into psychedelics and all that stuff."
39:47;39:52;"And so my little generation, my band, we are all from Marin County."
39:52;39:57;"But we sort of rebelled against the psychedelic thing, and we listened to soul music."
39:57;40:02;"Because there was a station in Oakland called KDIA, which is the one and only sister station,"
40:02;40:05;"I now know, of WDIA in Memphis."
40:05;40:09;"And they played just stead R&B."
40:09;40:12;"So we weren't into the psychedelic thing very much."
40:12;40:17;"We were much more into James Brown, you know, and stuff on KDIA."
40:17;40:19;"So you said your mom was into psychedelics."
40:19;40:20;"Definitely."
40:20;40:25;"My mom was pals with the dead people, and she lived out in Bolinas."
40:25;40:28;"My mom was one of the very first hippies, really, in San Francisco."
40:28;40:31;"Her significant other was--New Welch, a beat poet, was a great--"
40:31;40:33;"Oh, right, yeah. I read about that."
40:33;40:37;"And Gary Snyder and Philip Whelan, these people were always over the house."
40:37;40:43;"They grew up with poets everywhere, and right there in the breast of the counterculture, you know."
40:43;40:50;"Right. It's funny because people talk a lot about the children of hippies either leaned in or leaned away from that."
40:50;40:53;"You might be one of the first true child--"
40:53;40:59;"Because people think a lot about the children of hippies being like in the '80s, like an Alex P. Keaton."
40:59;41:03;"Here's this young guy who's kind of like, ""Oh, my parents were these hippie dippies."""
41:03;41:06;"But you were already that in the late '60s. You were kind of in real time."
41:06;41:11;"We were the first kind of hippie backlash, and our band was kind of the first hippie backlash band."
41:11;41:15;"Bill Chaplin was our hero, with the Sons of Chaplin."
41:15;41:18;"They had kind of consciousness-raising lyrics, if you will."
41:18;41:22;"""Freedom"" was one of their songs, but the music was dead R&B."
41:22;41:25;"It wasn't just psychedelic music that came out of there."
41:25;41:27;"Sly Stone created funk."
41:27;41:30;"He went to the Fillmore and said, ""Whoa, this is happening."""
41:30;41:32;"He was giving strokes for different folks."
41:32;41:37;"Now the R&B guys were talking about Aquarius and what star they were born."
41:37;41:41;"Nobody talked about that before. R&B was about the booty before that."
41:41;41:43;"So you weren't taking acid?"
41:43;41:45;"No, sure we were."
41:45;41:48;"I mean, no, not until-- I can't remember when I first took acid."
41:48;41:50;"I was probably--"
41:50;41:51;"Early teens?"
41:51;41:52;"17."
41:52;41:53;"Okay."
41:53;41:54;"Maybe."
41:54;41:55;"1967."
41:55;41:56;"Right."
41:56;41:59;"And so you were going to boarding school at Lawrenceville in New Jersey."
41:59;42:00;"Right."
42:00;42:02;"Which I'm familiar with. I grew up in New Jersey."
42:02;42:04;"Oh, yeah. And you went to Columbia, right?"
42:04;42:05;"Yeah, I went to Columbia."
42:05;42:07;"And I went to Cornell for five minutes over a two-year period."
42:07;42:08;"Oh, really?"
42:08;42:09;"Yeah."
42:09;42:12;"So, okay, go to Lawrenceville, then you're at Cornell, and then--"
42:12;42:16;"Well, actually, my mother started hanging out with the beatniks and the hippies,"
42:16;42:19;"and my dad thought that was a bad idea."
42:19;42:23;"Although my dad was a jazz drummer and a pretty cool guy, a bohemian in his own right."
42:23;42:24;"Right."
42:24;42:27;"But he didn't like the drugs. He just thought the drugs were really bad."
42:27;42:29;"And my mother was pretty wild, you know?"
42:29;42:30;"Right."
42:30;42:31;"So he wanted to get me out of there."
42:31;42:34;"So he convinced me that I should go to prep school."
42:34;42:35;"Right."
42:35;42:37;"And he said, ""This could be an opportunity for you."
42:37;42:40;"I'll see how the other people-- how the rest of the world lives."
42:40;42:42;"You know, these are the best and the brightest,"
42:42;42:44;"and if you can compete with these guys, it'll be good for you."""
42:44;42:45;"Yeah."
42:45;42:47;"So I went there for four years."
42:47;42:50;"Then I applied to Cornell. I was accepted at Cornell."
42:50;42:52;"And I came back home, and my dad said, ""All right, that's good."
42:52;42:53;"There's only one more thing I'm going to make you do."""
42:53;42:55;"He said, ""What's that?"" He said, ""Don't go to college."""
42:55;42:56;"I said, ""What? It's not yet."""
42:56;42:58;"""Take a year off and bum around Europe."""
42:58;43:02;"I said, ""But Dad, I'm going to go to school, and I'm going to play baseball and all this."""
43:02;43:05;"He said, ""You're 16. You're a year young. I'd skip second grade."""
43:05;43:08;"He says, ""Just take a year off and bum around Europe."""
43:08;43:13;"And by then I was playing harmonica, and I just took a handful of harmonicas"
43:13;43:16;"and hitchhiked across the country and went over to Europe"
43:16;43:20;"and went to North Africa and played in the square in Marrakesh."
43:20;43:22;"And so this is like '68?"
43:22;43:23;"This is '68."
43:23;43:24;"Yeah."
43:24;43:28;"And I went to Marrakesh for a day or two and got so stoned I couldn't leave for two months."
43:28;43:30;"You know, and just played harmonica."
43:30;43:31;"Yeah."
43:31;43:33;"And played all the way up through Spain and Greece and everywhere else."
43:33;43:37;"Then I went back to Cornell after a year, but I'd had it all."
43:37;43:40;"I'd had all the--for my prep school, I'd had all the--"
43:40;43:43;"so I could get good grades without even going to class."
43:43;43:44;"Yeah."
43:44;43:47;"So I hardly went to class and just joined bands."
43:47;43:51;"Then the next year we had the uprisings with the African American Student Society,"
43:51;43:54;"took over the Wilford Straight Hall, the parents-teachers thing."
43:54;43:55;"There were riots."
43:55;43:57;"This is '68 now, Chicago Convention."
43:57;44:00;"And we're on the cover of Newsweek and all this stuff."
44:00;44:01;"So you could take pass/fail."
44:01;44:02;"Yeah."
44:02;44:07;"So I took pass/fail, and the work caught up to me in my--halfway through my sophomore year,"
44:07;44:08;"and I dropped out."
44:08;44:09;"And went back to the Bay."
44:09;44:10;"I called my old man."
44:10;44:12;"I said, ""Look, I want to be a musician."""
44:12;44:13;"He said, ""Whatever."
44:13;44:15;"You either know what you're doing or you don't."
44:15;44:17;"I'll stick to my bargain,"" you know."
44:17;44:20;"And it looked like a bad decision for about 10 years."
44:20;44:21;"Yeah."
44:22;44:24;"Some days morning ever, and some days pass on by."
44:24;44:28;"I'll be working here forever, at least until I die."
44:28;44:31;"Damn if you do, damn if you don't."
44:31;44:34;"I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know that when I won't."
44:34;44:35;"Working for a living."
44:35;44:37;"Work."
44:37;44:38;"Working for a living."
44:38;44:40;"Work."
44:40;44:41;"Working for a living."
44:41;44:43;"Living and working."
44:43;44:46;"I'm taking what they're giving 'cause I'm working for a living."
44:52;44:55;"Hey, I'm not complaining 'cause I really need the work."
44:55;44:58;"But hitting up my buddies got me feeling like a jerk."
44:58;45:01;"Hundred dollar car, no 200 rent."
45:01;45:04;"I get a check on Friday, but it's already spent."
45:04;45:05;"Working for a living."
45:05;45:07;"Work."
45:07;45:08;"Working for a living."
45:08;45:10;"Work."
45:10;45:11;"Working for a living."
45:11;45:13;"Living and working."
45:13;45:16;"I'm taking what they're giving 'cause I'm working for a living."
45:16;45:19;"Working for a living."
45:19;45:21;"Working for a living."
45:29;45:32;"So the next 10 years you're back in--you're living in San Francisco?"
45:32;45:34;"Yeah, so I moved back to San Francisco."
45:34;45:36;"I was now 68."
45:36;45:40;"And San Francisco had exploded, you know, it was on fire."
45:40;45:45;"I joined a bluegrass band, kind of a 10-piece bluegrass band"
45:45;45:50;"that would--we'd go busking in the city at the Fisherman's Wharf just for a laugh."
45:50;45:52;"We'd make some good money as well and have fun,"
45:52;45:55;"and then I'll go to the bar and drink and have fun."
45:55;45:59;"And four of the guys in that band were from the band Clover."
45:59;46:01;"And they recruited me to join Clover."
46:01;46:04;"So then you're in Clover for the next 10 years or so?"
46:04;46:07;"Then I'm in Clover for about five years."
46:07;46:12;"And then I get signed to Phonogram Records, managed by Jake Riviere and Dave Robinson,"
46:12;46:17;"who end up starting Stiff Records, managing Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe,"
46:17;46:21;"The Rockpile, The Damned, all of that stuff."
46:21;46:24;"Unfortunately, they also managed this country rock band called Clover"
46:24;46:28;"because they thought that country rock was going to be the next big thing"
46:28;46:31;"and might have been, except that kind of the day we landed,"
46:31;46:36;"Johnny Rotten spit in the face of the first NME reporter, and the game was on, man."
46:36;46:38;"And we were in the wrong place at the wrong time."
46:38;46:41;"But we did a lot of session work, learned how to make records,"
46:41;46:43;"made two records with Mud Langer."
46:43;46:48;"And so the rest of the band backed up Elvis Costello on his first album, ""My M is True""?"
46:48;46:50;"Exactly. The rhythm section, four of them."
46:50;46:53;"Our singer, Alex Cald, and me didn't play on the record."
46:53;46:57;"Elvis told me, he said, ""I got a couple of songs you can play on if you want."""
46:57;47:00;"But it was the first week. They had flown us over to England."
47:00;47:04;"We lived in the south of Surrey in the big house"
47:04;47:07;"where Led Zeppelin cut their record with ""Rhythm of the Never."""
47:07;47:11;"And it was our first week off, and they worked us like dogs."
47:11;47:13;"We were playing always on the road, everywhere."
47:13;47:15;"And so I had a week off, and I went to Amsterdam."
47:15;47:18;"I had my girlfriend, and we went to Amsterdam, so I didn't play on the record."
47:18;47:21;"That wasn't sensitive, you being one of the singers of Clover,"
47:21;47:24;"and then this new guy, as soon as you get to Europe, is playing."
47:24;47:27;"You're just like, you're mellow. You're just like, ""Cool, man."""
47:27;47:31;"Well, interestingly, Jake and David signed Elvis."
47:31;47:35;"The first thing they did was put him with us, with us, I say my band,"
47:35;47:37;"the rhythm section, and they had a rehearsal."
47:37;47:40;"Our house was called Hedley Grange. It's down in Surrey."
47:40;47:43;"And it's kind of a famous rock and roll house down there now."
47:43;47:48;"Elvis came down on the train just to meet first, ""How you doing?"" and to rehearse."
47:48;47:50;"And he showed the rhythm section all those songs."
47:50;47:54;"I went to London for the day. I might have had a session or something."
47:54;47:56;"I can't remember what I was--but I was in London."
47:56;47:59;"So I come back in the evening, and Elvis goes back to London."
47:59;48:02;"It was their first day at rehearsal, and we're all having dinner."
48:02;48:05;"And I said, ""How was it?"" ""It was pretty good. The guy's okay."
48:05;48:08;"He looks a little strange, but he's pretty good. He's pretty good."""
48:08;48:11;"And my keyboard player, Sean Hopper, said, ""The guy's amazing."
48:11;48:14;"I'm telling you, his lyrics are unbelievable."""
48:14;48:18;"And Sean Hopper might have been the first person on the planet"
48:18;48:21;"to know how great Elvis Costello was that night."
48:21;48:24;"Yeah, I wonder what--it's interesting to imagine that era,"
48:24;48:26;"hearing somebody like him for the first time."
48:26;48:29;"♪ That girl's not one with the defects ♪"
48:29;48:33;"♪ She'll faint, shrink, breath, so correct ♪"

49:09;49:12;"Oh, and at some point you played with Thin Lizzy, right?"
49:12;49:15;"Yeah, well, then we went on the road with Thin Lizzy, Clover."
49:15;49:20;"We cut a record with Mutt Langer in Wales at Rockfield,"
49:20;49:24;"which is a great story. We were in A, and Black Sabbath was in B"
49:24;49:28;"with Ozzy in there, and we had soccer games every day, you know?"
49:28;49:31;"And Ozzy would get out there with his hobnail boots and stuff"
49:31;49:35;"and be playing soccer. We had a great time, man. It was really fun."
49:35;49:38;"But the record--we made a record, and then we go on tour with Thin Lizzy."
49:38;49:42;"And Phillip was amazing."
49:42;49:46;"And, you know, first of all, I don't know if you ever saw Thin Lizzy live or not,"
49:46;49:50;"but he was just an amazing performer."
49:50;49:54;"You couldn't take your eyes off him. He was just unbelievable."
49:54;49:57;"And he really kind of took me under his wing,"
49:57;50:00;"and I sat in with him a couple songs every night,"
50:00;50:04;"and I played on his solo record, and I would stay with him"
50:04;50:07;"when I was in London and stuff, and he would dress me out of his closet."
50:07;50:10;"He'd say, ""Here's--"" 'cause he had all this rock 'n' roll gear,"
50:10;50:14;"and he kept dressing me in, and he was just a wonderful guy, Phillip."
50:14;50:19;"# As I was going over"
50:19;50:23;"# The car that carried mountains"
50:23;50:26;"# I saw Captain Farrell"
50:26;50:30;"# And his money he was counting"
50:30;50:34;"# I first produced my pistol"
50:34;50:38;"# And then produced my radio"
50:38;50:41;"# I said, ""Stand on the liver"
50:41;50:45;"# Of the devil, he may take you"
50:45;50:49;"# But you're ready, dum-a-doo, dum-a-da"
50:49;50:53;"# Wait for my daddy-o"
50:57;51:01;"# There's whiskey in the jar-o"" #"
51:01;51:06;"So then, basically, that more or less brings us to the Huey Lewis and the News era."
51:06;51:08;"Now we're almost at the '80s."
51:08;51:11;"So I'm curious, looking back at that time--"
51:11;51:16;"and I think Jake and I are both big fans of the music of the 1970s."
51:16;51:20;"Jake coined the phrase ""the tasteful palate of the 1970s."""
51:20;51:23;"And I think one thing that's interesting to us--"
51:23;51:25;"and maybe this is how it always seems when you weren't there"
51:25;51:28;"and you're from a different generation, 'cause we always kind of think about"
51:28;51:33;"how Nirvana, for instance, came out 30 years ago."
51:33;51:35;"And we're just kind of like, ""It's mind-blowing."""
51:35;51:38;"It feels like yesterday, and it feels still pretty relevant."
51:38;51:41;"But then we think about how quickly things changed"
51:41;51:43;"in the era that you're talking about."
51:43;51:46;"1967 is the summer of love, 10 years later."
51:46;51:48;"Just, like, the world's so different."
51:48;51:50;"- Way different. - We've got punk rock."
51:50;51:53;"And so I'm thinking about, at this point, by 1980,"
51:53;51:57;"you're still not the Huey Lewis household name that everybody knows."
51:57;52:00;"At this point, you're pushing your early 30s."
52:00;52:03;"So you haven't quite made it yet as a household name."
52:03;52:08;"And yet, over your life, you've been meeting well-known poets"
52:08;52:14;"in the San Francisco beat scene, musicians from the early hippie days."
52:14;52:17;"And jazz musicians. My mom had--"
52:17;52:20;"Charlie Mingus was a boyfriend for a long time."
52:20;52:23;"So you would be-- wait, wait, wait. So you'd just be around Mingus?"
52:23;52:26;"Well, it would be more like I'd wake up in the morning"
52:26;52:28;"and Mingus would be at breakfast."
52:28;52:30;"- Really? - Yeah. My mom was--"
52:30;52:32;"Well, actually, now I want to get a little deeper on this."
52:32;52:35;"So your parents were still together when you moved to the Bay?"
52:35;52:38;"My parents were still together, but then they got divorced in '61."
52:38;52:40;"- Okay. - When I was 11 years old."
52:40;52:43;"And your dad's still working as a doctor?"
52:43;52:46;"As a radiologist. But he's a jazz drummer, really."
52:46;52:50;"He had a drum set up, just like you do in the studio all the time."
52:50;52:52;"But she loved black jazz musicians."
52:52;52:55;"She loved jazz and just loved it."
52:55;52:59;"She had-- John Handy was a boyfriend for a long time of hers."
52:59;53:03;"So I had music and poets, you know, always around."
53:03;53:08;"So long before you yourself were a famous musician,"
53:08;53:11;"your life just happened to have everybody from Charles Mingus"
53:11;53:15;"to Gary Snyder to Elvis Costello."
53:15;53:19;"I guess one of my questions is, by the time you're, like, you're 30,"
53:19;53:22;"you've had this zealot-like life,"
53:22;53:24;"which I don't think probably some of our listeners know about"
53:24;53:26;"because they probably-- you know, like a lot of people,"
53:26;53:28;"they think of you as, you know, in the '80s, these big heads."
53:28;53:29;"- A pop band. - Right."
53:29;53:34;"So by the time you're 30, you've just witnessed the music world--"
53:34;53:36;"you know, forget about politics and all these other huge changes,"
53:36;53:39;"but you just witnessed this crazy thing."
53:39;53:42;"You were there for the birth of the hippie movement."
53:42;53:43;"You're in the heart of it."
53:43;53:45;"And then you somehow, even being a member of a country rock band,"
53:45;53:48;"you end up being there for essentially the birth of punk rock."
53:48;53:51;"I almost feel like after that, you should, like, end up in the Bronx"
53:51;53:54;"and, like, see, like, Grandmaster Flash or something."
53:54;53:55;"Like, you were kind of kicking it with them."
53:55;53:59;"But so at that point, A, were you getting nervous about, you know,"
53:59;54:01;"did you have to go back to Cornell?"
54:01;54:06;"And B, was it bewildering just kind of seeing a 10- to 15-year period like that?"
54:06;54:10;"Did you have a sense of where you fit in or what you wanted to do, you know?"
54:10;54:15;"The punk thing was revelatory for me because when I joined Clover,"
54:15;54:20;"we spent most of our time trying to be attractive to major labels in the '70s."
54:20;54:23;"This was, like, '72 through '77."
54:23;54:24;"It's like the Eagles are huge."
54:24;54:27;"Yeah, we do showcases and then not get signed."
54:27;54:32;"And then we do demos and then get a showcase and not get signed."
54:32;54:36;"Then as the '70s got later, it was Boston or it was, you know,"
54:36;54:38;"kind of that kind of stuff."
54:38;54:41;"So it was kind of arena rockish, really, stuff."
54:41;54:47;"And when we signed and went to England, the punk thing for me was, like, liberating"
54:47;54:49;"because for my voice, I don't have a--I'm not a tenor."
54:49;54:51;"I'm a baritone."
54:51;54:55;"Most of my singers were tenors and high, and I come from R&B."
54:55;54:58;"My favorite singer is Johnny Taylor, you know?"
54:58;55:00;"So I never even sang with Clover."
55:00;55:02;"I just played harmonica for the most part, sang backup a little bit,"
55:02;55:03;"just played harmonica."
55:03;55:07;"Well, with the punks, I saw them thumbing their nose at the music business"
55:07;55:09;"and just saying, ""Hey, we don't care."
55:09;55:11;"We're just going to play our own songs our own way,"
55:11;55:14;"and we don't care about you, you know, music biz."
55:14;55:15;"We're going to do our own thing."""
55:15;55:18;"And I thought, ""Wow, how liberating,"" you know?"
55:18;55:21;"I vowed that if Clover ever broke up, that's what I was going to do,"
55:21;55:26;"go back home, surround myself with my favorite musicians,"
55:26;55:28;"and one of them would be a saxophone player."
55:28;55:30;"I'd have a lead sax player, not so much--"
55:30;55:32;"[imitates saxophone]"
55:32;55:35;"--so much guitar histrionics, and that's what I did."
55:35;55:37;"And it was like a catch-22."
55:37;55:40;"We started in this little local club every Monday night,"
55:40;55:42;"and by all means, just packed after a while."
55:42;55:45;"We had a thing called Monday Night Live, which was, you know,"
55:45;55:47;"just a kind of an entertainment thing."
55:47;55:50;"But I put a band together, the Monday Night Live band,"
55:50;55:52;"and we had these funny little songs."
55:52;55:55;"We worked up the Monday Night Live theme and all this stuff."
55:55;55:59;"And then I quietly was singing all the songs and learning to sing"
55:59;56:04;"and writing a little bit and putting an original song here and there and so on."
56:04;56:06;"And that's how kind of we started."
56:06;56:09;"And then the final story is we were doing funny stuff,"
56:09;56:13;"so we did like a disco version of Exodus that was fun, right?"
56:13;56:21;"[imitates guitar]"
56:21;56:22;"You get it."
56:22;56:26;"And so a studio owner came to our gig, couldn't get into the gig"
56:26;56:29;"because it was sold out, and said, ""Hey, do you want some free studio time?"""
56:29;56:30;"I said, ""Sure."""
56:30;56:33;"So for a laugh, we cut this disco version of Exodus."
56:33;56:37;"And then like a month later, Nick Lowe calls me and says,"
56:37;56:40;"""Can you come over to London and play on my record?"""
56:40;56:42;"And Dave Edmonds wants to cut Bad is Bad."
56:42;56:44;"And I said, ""Sure."""
56:44;56:47;"So they flew me to London. I went straight to the studio."
56:47;56:53;"We cut Bad is Bad, and I played on Born Fighter, one of Nick Lowe's tunes."
56:53;56:57;"And then Albert Lee came in and played on Sweet Little Lisa on Rock Pile"
56:57;56:58;"and just tore it up."
56:58;57:02;"And the session was over, and the record company comes down to hear the tracks."
57:02;57:04;"They hear the tracks, they like it."
57:04;57:06;"And there's like a lull. There's nothing much to say."
57:06;57:08;"I said, ""You guys want to hear something funny?"""
57:08;57:10;"And I put on the disco version of Exodus."
57:10;57:12;"Well, the record label loved it."
57:12;57:16;"So they said, ""Hey, that could be a hit. Let's make a singles deal."""
57:16;57:19;"I said, ""Sure. Come see us tomorrow."""
57:19;57:21;"And they left, and I asked Jake."
57:21;57:22;"Jake Revere, I said, ""What do I do?"""
57:22;57:25;"He says, ""Ask for 11 points and 3,000 pounds."""
57:25;57:28;"And he says, ""Don't leave until you get the 3,000 pounds."""
57:28;57:31;"And so I went in there, and they said, ""We want more vocal on it."
57:31;57:33;"We want you to sing a little more here and there."""
57:33;57:36;"I said, ""No problem, but you got to give me the 3,000 pounds."""
57:36;57:38;"And they wrote me a check for 3,000 pounds."
57:38;57:41;"I came home. I said, ""Hey, guys, we got something going here."""
57:41;57:44;"So I went back to the studio to put more vocal on the song."
57:44;57:49;"They had erased the multi-track by accident because the tones were on that reel."
57:49;57:54;"People don't know this anymore, but when you record an analog, big tape,"
57:54;57:57;"you had tones that you had to align the machine with."
57:57;58:01;"While they were saving money, normally you had a tone reel, and you have another reel."
58:01;58:03;"Well, they had the tones on the head of the reel."
58:03;58:06;"And while he was aligning the machine, he let it go too long,"
58:06;58:09;"and it recorded over the beginning of our song."
58:09;58:11;"And they were apologetic, crazy."
58:11;58:15;"I said, ""No problem, but I need a whole week to do this because I got a record."""
58:15;58:17;"They said, ""Okay, no problem."""
58:17;58:21;"So I just took the two-track, put it on two of the 20-chord track,"
58:21;58:25;"sang on another track, mixed it down to another two-track."
58:25;58:27;"It took me about two hours."
58:27;58:30;"And we lost a generation, and it sounded like crap anyway,"
58:30;58:33;"but I knew that wasn't what--and I spent the whole rest of the week"
58:33;58:35;"cutting three other songs."
58:35;58:39;"And it was the demo tape that got us our manager and our record deal."
58:39;58:41;"So that's kind of how it happened."
58:41;58:43;"Those were the first news recordings."
58:43;58:45;"So then you guys are a band."
58:45;58:48;"Soon after that, you'd have your own record deal, I imagine."
58:48;58:51;"Right, then we signed with Chrysalis Records, which is very ironic"
58:51;58:54;"because with their manager, all the labels came to see us."
58:54;58:56;"And we were the most American of bands."
58:56;58:59;"I mean, we're so American, it's frightening."
58:59;59:02;"But all the American labels passed on us."
59:02;59:05;"Terry Ellis from Chrysalis, 6,000 miles away,"
59:05;59:08;"flew out at a gig that we were terrible."
59:08;59:10;"I remember it was a really bad gig."
59:10;59:12;"I was trying to do a new song all the time."
59:12;59:14;"We were doing a new song every day."
59:14;59:17;"And we did this new song that had all these complex harmonies,"
59:17;59:19;"and we just murdered it."
59:19;59:21;"It was just terrible."
59:21;59:23;"And Jerry Greenberg from Atlantic Records was in the--"
59:23;59:26;"legendary Jerry Greenberg was in the crowd that night."
59:26;59:30;"And I could see him as I'm singing, and there's Terry Ellis from Chrysalis."
59:30;59:32;"And in the middle of this song that we're murdering,"
59:32;59:35;"I watched Jerry Greenberg stand up and leave."
59:35;59:37;"[laughs]"
59:37;59:39;"And at the end of the gig, it was a terrible gig,"
59:39;59:42;"we go back to the dressing room, we're just hanging our heads."
59:42;59:45;"And Terry Ellis comes by and he goes, ""Hello, lads, all right?"""
59:45;59:47;"""Yeah, everything okay?"""
59:47;59:49;"And we're going, ""Uh..."""
59:49;59:51;"""Could you hear yourselves?"""
59:51;59:53;"And six guys go, ""No."""
59:53;59:56;"""Ah, didn't think so. Hey, Huey, fancy a drink?"""
59:56;59:59;"And then we go across the street, he goes, ""Right, let's make a deal."""
59:59;01:00:01;"And that's how we got our record deal."
01:00:05;01:00:08;"[vocalizing]"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Went uptown"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"To see my cousin"
01:00:38;01:00:42;"Plays guitar, sound like a James Saunders"
01:00:42;01:00:48;"In the crowd I see his mom and dad"
01:00:48;01:00:54;"I say, ""Hey, hey, Uncle, man, your son's bad sometimes"""
01:00:54;01:00:57;"Sometimes, sometimes"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"Sometimes bad, bad"
01:00:59;01:01:02;"[vocalizing]"
01:01:02;01:01:10;"I said, ""Cool, but sometimes the man is bad"""
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Okay, so then you're signed by Chrysalis."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"At that time, was Blondie on Chrysalis?"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"Exactly. Blondie hadn't had a hit yet, though."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"Oh, okay. This is before the big album."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"So how were you describing the band?"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"Were you guys being contextualized by punk and new wave,"
01:01:26;01:01:29;"or you just called it rock and roll?"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"What was the context?"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"It was that. It was urgent, and it was fast,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"but it was really rhythm and blues based."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"So you never called it new wave?"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"No."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"What did the early press call you?"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"I think probably called it new wave."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Just because that was any kind of newish band?"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Whatever it was. If you wore a tie, it was new wave."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"I think all the guys wore ties."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"And you guys were wearing ties."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"We wore ties."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Skinny ties."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"At some point. Skinny tie."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Yeah."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"So maybe. Or string ties, you know, kind of thing. Whatever."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Did you have a scene?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Were there other bands that you felt a kinship to,"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"whether you knew them or not?"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"We didn't. We did our first album, Huey Lewis and the News,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"and it sold nine copies."
01:02:04;01:02:08;"And we tried to play everywhere, and we'd get murdered down here in LA."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"We'd come down and open up for Tommy Two-Tone,"
01:02:11;01:02:15;"or we'd open up for X, or we'd open up for the Blasters."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"So you'd open up for X."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"Is it straight up like Mohawk hardcore punks in the crowd?"
01:02:20;01:02:24;"We opened up. Yeah. We played the Whiskey, and then we played the Roxy,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"and we did the circuit."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"And we would get murdered down here. It was all we could do."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"No love."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"And our first record did nothing."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"So now we have a second record, and I call my pal Mutt,"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"who sends me ""We Both Believe in Love."""
01:02:38;01:02:41;"I rewrote it a little bit, and we had a hit with our second record."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"But it still didn't really follow through."
01:02:45;01:02:50;"It was a hit, kind of a radio hit, but we only sold 250,000 copies."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"And in those days, that wasn't very good."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"What was your psychological state?"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"At this point, you're in your early 30s. Were you sweating it?"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"No. I think I'm going to make it tomorrow."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"We're not sweating anything."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"You're always like, ""All right, cool."""
01:03:02;01:03:04;"I think I'm going to make it tomorrow."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"I've been thinking that since I'm 17."
01:03:06;01:03:11;"That's why I say it's never success that breaks bands up."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"You're always just kind of like, ""It's cool, man. Next record."""
01:03:13;01:03:15;"We're going to be good. We're going to be good."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"But by this point, we produced ourselves, which was really rare."
01:03:19;01:03:23;"After the first album didn't do anything, we auditioned a couple of producers."
01:03:23;01:03:27;"And by this point, as you said, I'm 31 years old maybe."
01:03:27;01:03:32;"I made records with Mutt Langer, who's the greatest producer of all time, maybe."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"And I learned all this stuff, so I could make the record."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"We could make the records."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"And we auditioned producers, and we kept thinking,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"""We can do this better ourselves."""
01:03:40;01:03:46;"Our manager went to bat for us, but fortunately, our label was 6,000 miles away"
01:03:46;01:03:49;"and a tiny little label, and so they couldn't really control us."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"So he said, ""Okay, produce your own record."""
01:03:51;01:03:54;"So we produced a second record ourselves, and we learned a lot."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"And now we're doing a third record, ""Sports."""
01:03:56;01:04:00;"And if you remember, it's really interesting to think about the time"
01:04:00;01:04:03;"because we're recording at '81, '82."
01:04:03;01:04:07;"And no jam band, no internet."
01:04:07;01:04:11;"There was only one avenue to success in 1980, and that's radio."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"That's a hit single."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"Top 40 Radio started the word ""Top 40"" in Fresno"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"when a programmer opined that with the advent of push-button radio,"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"if somebody heard something they didn't like,"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"they could now push the button and change the channel."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"So what you needed to do was narrow your playlist"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"and play the same hits over and over again"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"so nobody would ever leave the channel."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"That was called Top 40."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"And then FM radio came as an alternative to that first,"
01:04:37;01:04:42;"but then quickly it too was programmed very rigidly,"
01:04:42;01:04:46;"and by 1980 that format was called CHR, Contemporary Hit Radio,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"and that was the biz."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"That's where you had to be to exist."
01:04:51;01:04:55;"There was no other way of making a living in the music business."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"And you could see that clearly."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"You knew that."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"We had to have a hit single."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"The '70s were over."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"No more album-oriented stuff."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"We had to have a hit single."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Reagan and the White House."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"No, Reagan and the White House."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"It's the '80s."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Straight up."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"And that was the hardest thing for us,"
01:05:10;01:05:13;"is to have a hit single, a commercial single, with my voice and all that."
01:05:13;01:05:17;"And we didn't want it to be so commercial that it was sickening."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"You know what I mean?"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Right."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"We wanted to make those decisions ourselves, so we produced it ourselves."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"And we aimed every song at radio, or six of them anyway."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"There were only nine songs on the record."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Right."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"But six of them were aimed right at radio,"
01:05:31;01:05:36;"and each one different, one kind of R&B-ish, one kind of a rock tune,"
01:05:36;01:05:39;"one kind of a ballad, because we didn't know which one was going to hit or what."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Right."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"But we knew we needed a hit."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"We didn't think we were going to have six of them, but we needed a hit."
01:05:45;01:05:49;"And interestingly enough, when I listen to the sports record now at this time,"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"I realize it's a record of its time."
01:05:52;01:05:56;"It's a collection of singles, and that's what was going on."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Right."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Every song on that record is more or less a single."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"There's no like--"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"There was no other format."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"--5E instrumental."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"There was no AOR format."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Right."
01:06:04;01:06:08;"There was alternative stuff a little bit, but CHR radio was where it was at."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"So that must have been pretty gratifying."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Oh, it was great."
01:06:11;01:06:14;"To hunker down and say, ""All right, guys, things are changing."
01:06:14;01:06:19;"This album needs to be loaded with hits and needs to take us to the next level."""
01:06:19;01:06:22;"And probably you couldn't have even imagined the extent to which it actually did that."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"And interestingly, just to prove to you what we did,"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"when I say aimed at radio, that album, ""Sports,"""
01:06:28;01:06:35;"which looks like--you look at the cover, it looks like a nice bar band--is assembled."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Absolutely assembled piece by piece."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"It's like a collage?"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"No, we used drum machines."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"First time I ever heard a drum machine was 1980, '81."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"They had Jeff Beccaro's drums in a box."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"I said, ""What?"""
01:06:49;01:06:52;"They got Jeff Becaro's drum in a box."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"What do you mean?"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"It's a chip."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"What's a chip?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Are you serious?"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"A drum machine."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"A thin drum machine came out in 1981."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"Well, we jumped all over that."
01:07:02;01:07:07;"That's what bad is bad is."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"My idea was like, ""We need to get this stuff contemporary."""
01:07:11;01:07:13;"So we programmed those things."
01:07:13;01:07:18;"We didn't even know how to do it, but Peter Wolfe was producing ""Jefferson Starship"""
01:07:18;01:07:23;"in the studio next door with a--"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"We built this city, that kind of stuff."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"So I said, ""I got him on a break."""
01:07:27;01:07:30;"I said, ""Hey, can you show me how to do this?"""
01:07:30;01:07:31;"And he came in and programmed--"
01:07:31;01:07:35;"[imitating drumming]"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"That's a program bass."
01:07:36;01:07:41;"That's a drum machine on ""Want a New Drug"" in 1983."
01:07:41;01:07:45;"I reckoned if it was going to be a hit, which we needed, hits--"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Remember, CHR format."
01:07:47;01:07:51;"Probably at this point, there's only like 23 records in CHR."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"And the top five got 10 plays a day."
01:07:54;01:07:57;"So we were all competing for that top five spot."
01:07:57;01:08:03;"And when I say all, I mean the Commodores, Garth Brooks, Huey Lewis and the News."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"In other words, all formats."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"That was it."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"We're all going for that."
01:08:07;01:08:11;"So those records got played so often, they had to be perfect."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"So that was my idea."
01:08:13;01:08:17;"We need to program these things and get them just perfect."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"And that's what we do with sports."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"It seems like it's kind of a bar band record, but it's not."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"And subsequent records, we just captured."
01:08:25;01:08:31;"There's other records we made, we kept complete live tracks of years later, but not sports."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Sports was assembled."
01:08:33;01:08:37;"So you knew that you were kind of straddling eras."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"You really were at the early '80s."
01:08:39;01:08:44;"It's such an important kind of watershed moment for rock, and exactly what you're talking about."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"We needed to have a hit record."
01:08:46;01:08:49;"We needed to produce a hit record."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"In the competition, the records were perfect."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"What else were you listening to then?"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Were you listening to the early Phil Collins stuff?"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"He was early with drum machines."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"Well, this is before this, actually."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"I heard ""Hey 19."""
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Oh, Steely Dan."
01:09:04;01:09:07;"Don't listen to that."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"That's Steely Dan, those early Steely Dan stuff."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"He was the lead drum."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"I went, ""Whoa, that's unbelievable."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"That's a drum machine."""
01:09:14;01:09:15;"I said, ""You're kidding me."""
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Were you familiar with Kraftwerk?"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"Yes."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"But that was so out there."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"That's the other thing."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Not only Kraftwerk, but what was it?"
01:09:23;01:09:29;"(singing)"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"When German bands are funky, something's up."
01:09:33;01:09:36;"They don't have funky drummers in Germany."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Somebody's programming this stuff."
01:09:38;01:09:41;"Were you also familiar with some of the early hip-hop at that point?"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Yeah."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Grandmaster Flash and The Message and stuff?"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Yeah."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"That's what I said."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"We need to be contemporary with this stuff."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"That was the machine thing."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"We overdubbed drums."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"We overdubbed cymbals."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"We overdubbed fills."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"But the kick and snare were programmed."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"Sports came out in '83?"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Sports came out in '83, September of '83."
01:09:59;01:10:03;"It's funny to think also then, Bruce is probably thinking the exact same things"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"for Born in the USA in '84."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"When you think about the difference between--"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"That was his first record that had drum machine sounds."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"They triggered drums."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"I went to see Bruce in '84, Born in the USA."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"I'm at the Oakland Coliseum."
01:10:18;01:10:24;"I'm in the very back in a luxury box, but it's a mile from the stage,"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"and there's these stage speakers."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"They come out, first song, ""Dush, dush."""
01:10:29;01:10:31;"I go, ""Oh, my God, that's a Lin Drum."""
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Two snaps, I went, ""Oh, my God, they're triggering drums."""
01:10:34;01:10:37;"At intermission, I went back and saw Max,"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"and I went right back into the thing."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"I looked at his face and said, ""Are you triggering drums?"""
01:10:41;01:10:43;"He goes, ""Yeah, can you tell?"""
01:10:43;01:10:46;"You know what? They had a little trigger underneath the drum."
01:10:46;01:10:50;"It was so primitive that when you did a press roll,"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"you'd hear it go--"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"I couldn't handle it."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"The trigger couldn't catch up with it."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"But it could handle the--"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"[imitates drum sound]"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Oh, it's amazing."
01:11:00;01:11:03;"From then on, it got worse and worse and worse,"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"and nowadays, the cat is out of the bag."
01:11:06;01:11:10;"How much of that stuff that we see at a big concert is live?"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"Oh, yeah, yeah, in a lot of shows, very little."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"Frightening."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"We've found lately it kind of makes it seem quaint and fun"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"to just try to do as much stuff live as possible."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"Well, you do, but you know what I'm saying."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"Yeah, you don't have to. You absolutely don't have to."

01:13:24;01:13:26;"But then this little bit of editorializing--"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"""He's been compared to Elvis Costello,"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"""but I think Huey has a far more bitter,"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"""cynical sense of humor."""
01:13:31;01:13:35;"I feel like this part of the American psycho monologue"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"is a little bit unexamined."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"And so I guess one question that we had--"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"were you compared a lot to Elvis Costello in the early days?"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"I don't think so."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Only because the band I used to be in"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"backed up his band and so on."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"-That was known. -And he's a friend."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"He's just a wonderful guy."
01:13:48;01:13:50;"I don't know, as a person."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Elvis is a wonderful guy."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"And did you feel a kinship with him"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"as just a musician and a songwriter?"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"Yeah, well, 'cause we were there at the same time."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"You know, he's incredibly smart, Elvis."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"And so is Nick Lowe, and so is Jake Rivera."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"The three of them are super bright."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"And, you know, hanging out with smart people is just fun."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"So they're always fun to hang out with."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"And he's also sweet as pie."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"I mean, when I lost my hearing,"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"one of the first things I got was from Elvis"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"about, you know, ""Rootin' for you,"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"""need you to get back out here,"" and all this."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"-Oh, that's cool. -Just beautiful, man."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"So you guys are tight to this day."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Yeah, we're friends."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"But I don't see that as--"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"we do different things."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"I like funny a little more."
01:14:27;01:14:28;"I'm a little funnier."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"Do you think you're more bitter and cynical?"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"[laughs]"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"Let's go with that."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"Because that's the thing about it."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"I don't think about that sort of stuff."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"'Cause then he talks about--"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"he specifically talks about ""Hip to Be Square,"""
01:14:39;01:14:40;"a song so catchy most people"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"probably don't listen to the lyrics."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"But they should, because it's not just about"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"It's also a personal statement about the band itself."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"That made me go back to the lyrics to ""Hip to Be Square."""
01:14:51;01:14:52;"And it is interesting."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Like, you could read ""Hip to Be Square"""
01:14:54;01:14:55;"in a few different ways."
01:14:55;01:14:56;"And one thing we do on this show"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"is we tend to go pretty deep on lyrics."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"And so I wonder if you'd tell us a little bit about this."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"Well, I can tell you everything."
01:15:01;01:15:05;"I mean, I originally wrote that song in the third person."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Right?"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"He used to be a renegade."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"He used to fool around."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"He couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"And it was meant to articulate a phenomenon"
01:15:12;01:15:16;"that, you know, is well documented."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"David Brooks wrote ""Bobos in Paradise"""
01:15:19;01:15:22;"about bohemians, the lifestyle of bohemians"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"getting just too weird, and they drop back in."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"And they become squares again."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Because, you know, they cut their hair."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"At the time when this song came out in the '80s,"
01:15:31;01:15:34;"the word ""yuppie"" in the concept was big in the media, right?"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"So were you talking about, would yuppies be--"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"That's it."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"I was talking about them dropping back in."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"But I thought it would be even funnier"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"if I told it on myself."
01:15:41;01:15:44;"And unfortunately, some people took it"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"as an anthem for square people, you know?"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Right."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"It was not meant that way at all."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"It was actually a poorly told joke, is the truth."
01:15:51;01:15:54;"It's cool that you invited that by making it first person."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"I thought it would be even funnier."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"Yeah, yeah."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Because I thought it would be self-effacing."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"But no."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"You found it just funny."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"Yeah."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"That people had ping pong from hippies to--"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Imagine in the third person."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Yeah."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"You know, just read it all in the third person."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"It's about this guy."
01:16:07;01:16:10;"It'd be like a Don Henley song in third person."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"OK, this actually helps me understand."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Because I'm looking at the third verse."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"It's not too hard to figure out."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"You see it every day."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"And those that were the farthest out"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"have gone the other way."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"That's a very interesting one, too."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Because-- so you're talking about kind"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"of hippie to yuppie transition."
01:16:22;01:16:23;"That's it."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"You're saying the people who are probably"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"like the most fight the power, the most radical,"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"doing the most acid, are now the most capitalist."
01:16:30;01:16:33;"You know what's also interesting is that you"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"had a unique perspective on this being from the Bay."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"I had a little head start on that."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Because I saw that in its very beginning,"
01:16:39;01:16:43;"before it happened worldwide, you know, kind of like thing."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"And it's really true today in a way."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"I mean, you know, it's the hippies aren't hippies."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"These guys are-- I think in my mom's realm,"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"she would go, you know, they aren't hippies today."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"These hippies-- I mean, with their edibles"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"and their vape pipes."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"I mean, they can't even roll a joint, these kids today."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"And legalization?"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Are you kidding me?"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"Do you want government between you and your dealer?"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"What is that?"
01:17:05;01:17:06;"That's crazy."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Yeah."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"And so by the early-- by, I guess, the mid '80s,"
01:17:09;01:17:10;"when you're writing ""Hip to Be Square,"""
01:17:10;01:17:14;"are you kind of aware of like Steve Jobs of the world,"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"the kind of hippie businessman types?"
01:17:16;01:17:17;"Kind of."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Because that was starting to become a thing."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"That's it."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"That's what I was trying to articulate."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"So when you say you see them on the freeway,"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"it don't look like a lot of fun,"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"but don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Was that part straightforward?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"You don't try to fight an idea whose time--"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"was your perspective just kind of like, it is what it is?"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"It is what it is."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"It's ""Hip to Be Square."""
01:17:34;01:17:38;"This song in some ways reminds me lyrically of like"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Billy Joel's ""Still Not Rockin' Rollin' Me,"""
01:17:40;01:17:41;"but he's like angry in that song."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"He's kind of like mad about like, hey, man,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"oh, now you're saying what used to be cool is uncool,"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"blah, blah, blah."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"He had this like anger."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"You're kind of like a wry observer."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"Trying to be, yeah."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"I think that's probably right."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"I'm just trying to articulate that phenomenon"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"that I saw beginning to happen all around me."
01:17:58;01:18:01;"And actually, what's interesting is that we wrote it"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"and sang it, and we had a real tight window."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"This is ""Hip to Be Square"" is on the four album."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"The conventional wisdom was, you know,"
01:18:08;01:18:13;"we sold a lot of-- 10 million records on the sports album."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"So no matter what you sold, it was--"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"at then it was, what, at seven or eight."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"Get another record out right away,"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"because the next record's gonna do half of your last record"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"at the very worst."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"So you're an idiot if you don't get a record out right away."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"Because you're gonna make this money,"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"and you need to do this."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"So we had all kinds of pressure on us for that,"
01:18:32;01:18:35;"and then we had ""Stuck With You"" was the first single"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"on that record, and we had it done,"
01:18:36;01:18:39;"and we mixed it, and we gave it to the record company,"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"and they released it."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"And now we had-- they had to come with the album"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"because they had it on the radio."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"And so we had two studios,"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"and we were in a super big hurry."
01:18:47;01:18:49;"And so I kind of blame that."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"I didn't have enough reflection time on that, you know,"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"on ""Hip To Be Square"" and a few of those."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"And I think I would have caught some of that stuff."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"We really kind of rushed that record a little bit,"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"and I still feel bad about that."
01:19:01;01:19:04;"That's-- my one regret is that I wish I'd kept it"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"in the third person."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"- Right. - You know?"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"- There's something noble about going for the first person."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Just, like, bring it on. - I'm glad you get it."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- Yeah, I like that. - You know who got that a lot?"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Who actually really understood this in a sense"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"because we had people around us"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"who were turning into drug addicts at this point."
01:19:19;01:19:22;"Luther Vandross pulled me aside and said"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"he loved that song. - Yes."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"- He felt it was a real message to these people"
01:19:27;01:19:30;"to get clean, you know? - Interesting."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"- And I thought, ""Wow, that's pretty cool."""
01:19:32;01:19:35;"I hadn't meant that, but if that works, that's great."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"I'm all for it. - You can read--"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"like, yeah, it's hip to not be messed up on drugs."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- Yeah, yeah. - You can read the song"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"in a lot of ways."

01:20:45;01:20:47;"The Grateful Dead, is you being from the band,"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"and we looked it up, you jammed with"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"The Grateful Dead on Harmonica."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"When would that have been, late '80s?"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"- I think it was early '90s."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"- Oh, early '90s."
01:20:56;01:20:57;"- Well, actually, I jammed with them"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"a few times, really."
01:20:58;01:21:01;"- Obviously, you weren't that into hippie stuff per se,"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"but were you a fan of the Dead?"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"- Oh, yeah."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"- So you always respected them as musicians."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"- And I saw 'em in the film"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"on early days with Pigpen,"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"and Pigpen was amazing."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"- And so he, liking the blues,"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"he could hear a lot more."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"- Good morning, old school girl."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"He used to just tear that up."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"And at the end, there'd always be a jam,"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"be Smokestack Lightning, or something,"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"and it'd be the Dead, the airplane,"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"and the Quicksilver Messenger Service,"
01:21:22;01:21:26;"all on stage for a 20-minute version"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"of Smokestack Lightning."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"So I grew up in that."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Yeah, absolutely, I was a kid,"

01:21:32;01:21:33;"And you know, Jerry,"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"I got to know Jerry a little bit."

01:21:39;01:21:41;"But he was really the spokesman"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"for the whole generation, you know?"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"'Cause we forget that Film Auditorium"

01:21:47;01:21:48;"what the actual number is,"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"but is it 800 or 1,000 people?"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"I mean, you could see the Grateful Dead,"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"the Jefferson Airplane,"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"and the Quicksilver Messenger Service."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"And so when the thing blew up,"

01:22:00;01:22:03;"to find out, make heads or tails of this thing,"

01:22:06;01:22:09;"And he told them, ""This isn't about drugs."
01:22:09;01:22:12;"""This is about rampant intellectualism."""
01:22:12;01:22:15;"And that's pretty much what it was, you know?"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"And he was such a sweetheart."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"When I jammed with him,"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"the last time I played with him was in Oregon."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"And they had the,"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"it was the first time I'd ever had in-ear monitors."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"This was a long time ago, probably early '90s."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"And they said, ""Here, we're gonna put these in your ear."""
01:22:31;01:22:32;"And I put these things in my ear,"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"and now I can hear."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"And they had these things"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"where they could defeat their microphone"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"and push a button and speak to each other"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"without it going out there, you know,"
01:22:41;01:22:42;"that kind of monitor thing."
01:22:42;01:22:45;"So now I'm hearing people talking to each other"
01:22:45;01:22:48;"and the music, and, you know, I don't know what's going on."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"I'm trying to make heads or tails of this."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"And my harmonica amp is back,"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"way back there somewhere,"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"and it's kind of feeding back a little bit."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And now I'm wondering what to do,"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"and I look back towards my amp,"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"and Jerry has left the front of the stage."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"He's all the way in the back,"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"back to the audience, adjusting my amplifier,"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"making my amplifier sound good."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"Isn't that great?"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"In the early '90s, it must have been in front of"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"tens of thousands of people."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"Yeah, it was 50,000 people where it was, a big stadium."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"He realized that I was on Mars or whatever,"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"and my harmonica was feeding back,"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"and he just went over there and fixed everything for me,"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"just tuned it all up."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"Oh, wow."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"So that must have been an amazing"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"kind of full-circle moment."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"Yeah."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"Did they, like, know your mom back in the day?"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Yeah, yeah."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Did they kind of remember your family from--"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Yeah, well, Danny Rifkin was a good pal to my mom,"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"and he was their manager, so--"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"Oh, wow."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"People forget, but when the Dead first started,"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"what--the radio was playing,"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"""Love, love me do."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"You know I love you."""
01:23:46;01:23:48;"Little three-minute songs."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"These guys went, ""Hey, we're gonna blow that model"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"right out of the water."""
01:23:51;01:23:53;"They were amazing in their beginning."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"So I gotta ask, as somebody who jammed with them,"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"this is something we've talked about on the show,"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"you know, if it's too spicy,"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"you say the word, we can move on."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"But another person who jammed with the Dead"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"in the early '90s, in fact, went on tour opening for them,"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"is another Bay Area musician, Steve Miller."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Sure."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"So he went on tour opening for the Dead"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"in the late '80s, early '90s,"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"and he'd play with them from time to time"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"and seemed to have a good rapport."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"And then a few years after Jerry died,"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"he did an interview where he just went off"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"on how much they sucked."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Yeah, right."
01:24:23;01:24:24;"So we just kind of--"
01:24:24;01:24:25;"He's a funny guy."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"He's--I remember in the Oracle,"
01:24:27;01:24:31;"the Oracle was the first Hay-Dashbury hippie paper."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"And they interviewed Steve Miller."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"And the Who had come out,"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"and they were smashing their instruments and stuff."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"And they asked him about it."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"He said, ""Yeah, they're smashing their instruments"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"'cause they're pissed off."""
01:24:41;01:24:42;"He says, ""Have you heard 'em?"""
01:24:42;01:24:43;"He says, ""If you sounded like that,"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"you'd be pissed off, too."""
01:24:45;01:24:48;"So he's been a sh--talker since the early days."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Always."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Hendrix and all that sh--,"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"he's just trying to get in tune, man."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"He just said that in an interview."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"It's true."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Dave Robinson was his road manager."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"That's what Jimmy would do."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"He'd--[roars]"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"He'd distort it, and then he'd tune it."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Didn't have tuners, you know, in those days."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"So that's what he'd do."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Well, he also recently did an interview"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"where he said that when he set his guitar on fire,"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"he said that sucked."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Well, Miller's always been a contrary in that way."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"Okay, so that kind of--"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"'Cause we just always felt like,"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"""Man, you know, after Jerry died, such a tragedy,"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"and you stood on stage with these guys,"
01:25:18;01:25:19;"and now you're gonna say--"""
01:25:19;01:25:20;"That's stupid."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"changed the playing field, period."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"They just changed the whole deal."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"You know, a lot came out of there that set."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"Not only just that--ready?"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"Funk."
01:25:31;01:25:34;"Sly Stone went to the Fillmore Auditorium"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"and saw the scene, went, ""Wow."""
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Okay?"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"He produced the Bob Rumbles."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"""Laugh, Laugh,"" produced by Sylvester Stewart."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Sly Stone produced that."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"He was a disc jockey at KSOL Radio."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Very bright guy."
01:25:48;01:25:50;"Knew what was going on totally."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Saw the hippie thing, said, ""Wow."""
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Wrote ""Everyday People."""
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Different strokes for different folks."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"Black one, what the white one who doesn't want the--"
01:25:58;01:26:01;"Nobody did that in R&B before."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"That became funk."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"That became Earth, Wind & Fire, Rick James, Prince."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"That was a whole arm of music"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"where R&B suddenly talked about consciousness."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"That happened in San Francisco."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"The other thing that happened in San Francisco"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"was hard rock created riff rock."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"Jimi Hendrix took the blues,"
01:26:18;01:26:22;"turned it up to 11, and created hard rock."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Period. One guy."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"All this happened pretty much in San Francisco."
01:26:26;01:26:29;"It's pretty incredible how much comes out of that moment."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"And country rock, too."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"The Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers,"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"Commander Cody, hippie, what became the Sleep of the Wheel,"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"and hippie country music."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"That was also San Francisco."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"You don't live in San Francisco anymore."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"You live in Montana?"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"No, I live in Montana,"
01:26:45;01:26:49;"but I have our studio and rehearsal space"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"and offices in Marin still."
01:26:51;01:26:54;"Oh, so you're still totally connected to the Bay Area."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"In fact, Bobby Weir's my landlord."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"For real?"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Yeah."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"So you see Bobby and Phil and all them just around?"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Yeah."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"They're Marin boys."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Right."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"We've been talking a lot about"
01:27:05;01:27:09;"how many seismic moments in culture you've witnessed."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"How about the last 20 years of Marin?"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Has that been kind of shocking"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"watching the tech take over and the real estate window?"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"It's lost its personality somewhat."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"California as well."
01:27:21;01:27:24;"It's so crowded anymore for me."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"I travel and come back, and it's amazing."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"If you go away for three months and come back,"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"it's exponentially busier."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"And it's harder to be individual"
01:27:33;01:27:36;"when there's everything going on,"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"the Internet and all that stuff."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"I don't think regional stuff"
01:27:39;01:27:42;"doesn't account for what it used to."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"So you're kind of out on a ranch or something?"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Yeah."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"What do you get up to out there?"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Well, outdoors."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"What's your day-to-day like?"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"I fly fish a lot."
01:27:49;01:27:52;"I hike, ride my horse, all outdoor stuff."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"It's just beautiful out there."
01:27:54;01:27:55;"Mother Nature."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Bozeman area?"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"I'm actually in Missoula."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Okay."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Over in the Bitterroot Valley."
01:28:00;01:28:02;"Have you been to the Kettle House Amphitheater yet?"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"In Missoula?"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"In Missoula."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"Yeah, I know where it is, I think."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"We're playing there for the first time next year."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Everybody says it's beautiful."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Are you really?"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"I haven't been."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Cool."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"I'll come see you."
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Yeah."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Are you hitting the road?"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"So you guys got to--"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"I can't sing right now."
01:28:15;01:28:16;"I still can't sing."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I have this--"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"although my hearing is as good as it's been in two years, right, today."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"Right, so you've been dealing with some pretty intense--"
01:28:23;01:28:26;"I've had a thing called Meniere's disease that nobody really knows what it is."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Yeah."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"Most people that have been diagnosed with Meniere's disease,"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"vertigo is their major problem."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"And vertigo is completely debilitating when you have it."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I've had vertigo 35 years ago."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"I had four or five bouts of this stuff."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"But I'm by that now."
01:28:42;01:28:45;"I lost my hearing in my right ear 35 years ago."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"Completely?"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"Well, no, about 70%, 75%."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"So I can still hear a little bit."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"So 35 years ago, you were probably touring a lot with the band, right?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"I was touring a lot."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"It was before a gig."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"I couldn't-- I just got so sick."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"You were about to go on stage."
01:28:59;01:29:03;"Yeah, well, I was in the afternoon about to go to soundcheck and just got so sick."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"I couldn't get out of bed, threw up."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"They took me to the hospital."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"And I've had three or four of those bouts."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"They give you a Thorazine or a Valium, and then you're fine."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"You go to sleep, wake up four hours later, you're okay."
01:29:15;01:29:20;"But these attacks can happen, and some people get them all the time,"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"and it's hugely debilitating."
01:29:22;01:29:29;"Me, I've just had several vertigo episodes, and I lost my hearing in my right ear."
01:29:29;01:29:34;"And now a year and nine months ago, October 27 will be a year and nine months,"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"I lost the hearing in my left ear before a gig."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"And now my hearing fluctuates still?"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Yeah."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Episodically."
01:29:40;01:29:49;"It'll be a week of-- or 10 days of okay, and then five days of just completely deaf."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"I mean, almost--"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"Even with, like, high-tech hearing aids?"
01:29:52;01:29:57;"Yeah, I mean, I have-- when my hearing's good, like it is now, without these, I'm dead."
01:29:57;01:30:01;"I mean, I can't hear much without these, so I need these."
01:30:01;01:30:05;"And even when the hearing's good, my hearing's bad, they don't help at all."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"I can't hear the phone, I can't watch television, nothing."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Oh, man."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"So what do you do when you're in that kind of zone?"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"You read a lot."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"You read, you fish, you ride your horse."
01:30:15;01:30:18;"So you're still able to find peace in those moments?"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"And you spend time by yourself."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"Because when you're alone, there's nobody not to hear."
01:30:22;01:30:27;"And it's strange for me because I'm a very outgoing guy, and I like social stuff."
01:30:27;01:30:31;"But the last two years, I've learned to be by myself more."
01:30:31;01:30:36;"It's frustrating to be-- if you can't hear, to be in a group where you can't hear anything."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"Although my hearing's good now, I'm hoping to get better."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"It's a long, long story."
01:30:41;01:30:48;"But music is harder to listen to than speech because it resonates or distorts at the bottom end."
01:30:48;01:30:52;"My hearing problem-- my functional ear is my left ear, but it varies."
01:30:52;01:30:58;"And when it's bad, the lower end-- you can see it on the tests-- just goes to [bleep]"
01:30:58;01:31:06;"And it distorts, so a bass part that's [imitates bass] goes [imitates bass]"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"And I just fight for pitch."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"It's just horrible."
01:31:09;01:31:15;"But you've had enough moments when your hearing was good enough that you could write songs and record over the past few years?"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"I can kind of sing a song and write a song."
01:31:17;01:31:19;"I can write in my head a little bit."
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I can sing from memory a little bit."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"We have a musical that we've just-- we've been working on."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Who don't?"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I think it's pretty good."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"We put it up in San Diego, and it did very well."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Oh, great."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"We're trying to get it to Broadway, but I wrote a new song for that."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"Right."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"And so, you know, I can--"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"Right, but touring, you totally have to play by ear."
01:31:38;01:31:41;"So, yeah, I'm just hoping that my body will take care of itself."
01:31:41;01:31:45;"I've tried-- I've been to House Ear Institute here in L.A. a couple times."
01:31:45;01:31:49;"Been to Stanford Ear Institute, Mayo Clinic, UCSF."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Talked to Dr. Stephen Rouse."
01:31:51;01:31:54;"He's kind of the granddaddy of them all at Mass General, and I hear--"
01:31:54;01:31:58;"and nobody on the Western side of things knows anything about what I have."
01:31:58;01:32:02;"I've tried acupuncture, chiropractic, cranial massage,"
01:32:02;01:32:09;"all organic diet with no caffeine, no chocolate, low salt, essential oils,"
01:32:09;01:32:13;"all kinds of different regimens, protocols with supplements, 20 pills in the morning"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"and 18 at night, or capsules and herbs."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"Yeah."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Nothing works."
01:32:18;01:32:21;"I'm on some new stuff now that my pal Jimmy Kimmel gave me,"
01:32:21;01:32:22;"and I'm hoping it's going to work."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"11 days now with pretty good hearing."
01:32:25;01:32:29;"My previous longest stretch is 21 days in two years."
01:32:29;01:32:34;"So if I can maintain this for a month, I'm going to try to sing in some situation"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"and find a way to do it somehow."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"Right."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"So speaking of new songs and what you've been writing,"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"the new song out now, ""Her Love is Killing Me,"""
01:32:43;01:32:45;"this was one that you wrote in the past couple years?"
01:32:45;01:32:50;"Well, no, I mean, embarrassingly, this is a song that Chris Hayes and I wrote,"
01:32:50;01:32:54;"I don't know, before you were born maybe, a long time ago."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"And we just couldn't get it right."
01:32:56;01:32:59;"We tried to record it, we played it live, and we never got it right."
01:32:59;01:33:00;"And we threw it away."
01:33:00;01:33:05;"And then I guess Johnny probably rekindled it with a new horn arrangement or something."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"We worked it up, and I don't know what happened."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"It just kind of came together."
01:33:08;01:33:12;"Sometimes the simplest ideas take the longest time."
01:33:12;01:33:15;"It's weird, but it's a very simple song."
01:33:15;01:33:19;"I don't know, tempo is more important with songs"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"that don't have a lot of changes maybe."
01:33:21;01:33:25;"I don't know, whatever, but feel is more important."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"So this song's been all over the place."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"You've tried it here and there over decades."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"This is the definitive version."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Okay, great."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Well, let's check it out."
01:33:32;01:33:35;"Some new music from Huey Lewis and the News, ""Her Love is Killing Me."""
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Can't eat, I can't sleep"
01:33:38;01:33:42;"I'm so nervous I can't keep the beat"
01:33:42;01:33:46;"Can't run, I can't hide"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"In a damn suit, can't keep her satisfied"
01:33:49;01:33:53;"Drifting and drifting like a ship at sea"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"Her love is killing me"
01:33:56;01:34:00;"Burning hot, a big flame"
01:34:00;01:34:03;"Build like a shotgun on a .22 frame"
01:34:03;01:34:07;"She's got soul, she's got a lot of heart"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Doors that'll make the best plans fall apart"
01:34:10;01:34:14;"I ain't what half the man I used to be"
01:34:14;01:34:17;"Her love is killing me"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"Up and on like a flashing light"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"First thing in the morning and the last thing at night"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Twisting and turning like a hurricane"
01:34:27;01:34:31;"Her love is driving me insane"
01:34:31;01:34:35;"My head hurts, my body aches"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"I quit drinking but I got the shakes"
01:34:38;01:34:42;"So sore I can hardly walk"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"Eat out this bumble when I try to talk"
01:34:45;01:34:49;"Stumbling and tumbling like a bumblebee"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"Her love is killing me"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Whoo!"
01:34:57;01:35:11;"Whoo!"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Whoo!"
01:35:13;01:35:17;"If I could just get along for a night"
01:35:17;01:35:21;"I'd kick this out of the house and I'd be alright"
01:35:21;01:35:24;"I can't see that wicked look in your eyes"
01:35:24;01:35:28;"Looks like we could be here forever"
01:35:28;01:35:32;"I can't relax, I'm uptight"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"I'm taking pain relievers every night"
01:35:35;01:35:39;"So tense, I can't breathe"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"So tense, I can't cope"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"And I'd be hanging if I had some room"
01:35:45;01:35:49;"Flipping and tripping like a dog hippie"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"Her love is killing me"
01:35:52;01:35:56;"Her love is killing me"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Huey, thank you so much."
01:35:58;01:36:02;"We really made you take us all the way from 1950 to the present."
01:36:02;01:36:05;"We learned a lot. It was really great talking to you."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Everybody check out the new music."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"We'd love to have you out in Montana if you're around."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"Great. Knockout."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Next spring, I think. Next summer."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"We'll stay in touch."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Absolutely."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Thanks. It was a lot of fun."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Anything for a white claw, you know."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"You're listening to..."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Time Crisis"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"On Beat One"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"Well, Huey Lewis, hell of a guest."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Wow."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"This show's become too powerful, back-to-back,"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"Justin Verne and Huey Lewis."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"That was a real journey through, like, the second half of the 20th century."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Huey and Justin have something in common."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"What's that?"
01:36:54;01:36:57;"They both discussed Steve Miller on Time Crisis."
01:36:57;01:37:03;"No, but also, like, they're guys whose lives have taken them across genres."
01:37:03;01:37:04;"Yeah."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"They performed with The Grateful Dead/Dead & Co."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"Sick."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"And they've both been on Time Crisis."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"Maybe next episode we'll do Top 5 Biggest Boney Ver songs"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"versus Top 5 Biggest Huey Lewis songs."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Would love that."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Look for connections."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"The narcissism of small differences."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"So, before we get into this week's Top 5,"
01:37:21;01:37:25;"Jake, I understand you've updated the Tasteful Palate playlist for fall."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Yep. Fall vibes."
01:37:27;01:37:30;"And just so people know, if you're already subscribed to the Tasteful Palate playlist,"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"we'll tweet a link out to it if you're not."
01:37:32;01:37:36;"But if you're already subscribed, what we're going to do now is rotate it seasonally."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"So it's kind of like if you went into Starbucks in October"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"and you couldn't get iced coffees off the menu."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Now we've got pumpkin spice lattes."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"But iced coffee will come back."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Does Starbucks have, like, a spring beverage?"
01:37:47;01:37:51;"There was this trend of these kind of, like, unicorn drinks, these rainbow things."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"You know what I'm talking about, Seinfeld?"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"[laughter]"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Those are called unicorn things."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"It was the unicorn latte."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"Yes, that's kind of springtime-y."
01:38:00;01:38:04;"Yeah, I'm just looking up if they actually have any seasonal spring drinks."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"This is also classic, late as hell time crisis."
01:38:07;01:38:11;"Jake, before the next episode, you and me, let's rip to a Starbucks."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"That's also something I didn't talk about in Seattle."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"I went to the first Starbucks."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Oh, wow."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"That's kind of all there is to say."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Okay."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"It's funny, though."
01:38:18;01:38:21;"Being in Seattle, I probably got coffee, like, five times."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Let's say I was there, like, two and a half days."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Three out of five were at Starbucks."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"I woke up in the morning. I left the hotel."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"I ran into one of the guys from the band."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"I was like, ""What are you doing?"""
01:38:30;01:38:31;"He's like, ""I'm looking for coffee."""
01:38:31;01:38:32;"I'm like, ""Where are you going?"""
01:38:32;01:38:33;"He's like, ""I looked up this place on the map."""
01:38:33;01:38:34;"I was like, ""Oh, what's the vibe?"""
01:38:34;01:38:35;"He told me about it."
01:38:35;01:38:36;"I was like, ""Huh."""
01:38:36;01:38:40;"He was like, ""Well, you know, there's always the original Starbucks down the street."""
01:38:40;01:38:41;"""Half is a joke."""
01:38:41;01:38:42;"I was like, ""Really?"""
01:38:42;01:38:44;"He was like, ""Yeah, you got to wait in line, though."""
01:38:44;01:38:46;"I was like, ""That's where I'm going."""
01:38:46;01:38:48;"There's always a line at the original?"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"All tourists?"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"I would say I wait in line for five minutes."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Whoa, and what did you get there?"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"It's the regular menu."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"I think I got iced Americano."
01:38:56;01:39:00;"Most people in Seattle have sort of a tortured relationship because it's a city."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"It's a culturally rich city."
01:39:02;01:39:07;"A lot of famous subcultures have come out of Seattle, but at the same time, like Starbucks"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"has this huge corporate behemoth."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"Is it like hometown hero?"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"I think so."
01:39:12;01:39:13;"Is it like hometown boy did good?"
01:39:13;01:39:17;"I think it's the same way that a giant company like Tim Hortons can still feel like small-towny"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"in Canada."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"I'm sure it cuts both ways."
01:39:19;01:39:22;"I'm sure there's people there who are just like, ""I'm never going to Starbucks."""
01:39:22;01:39:28;"It's kind of like how Huey was talking about how Sly Stone, Grateful Dead, all this, so"
01:39:28;01:39:33;"much stuff came out of San Francisco, and then you think Seattle produced Microsoft,"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Starbucks, and Amazon."
01:39:35;01:39:36;"And Costco."
01:39:36;01:39:37;"And Costco?"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Yeah."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"Kirkland, Washington."
01:39:40;01:39:44;"I'm sure people in Seattle don't feel this way, especially old-timers because they've"
01:39:44;01:39:49;"seen Seattle change so much, but I feel like in the national conversation, San Francisco"
01:39:49;01:39:55;"is shorthand for tech money, changing, rich city, blah, blah, blah."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"And Seattle, this is something wild, too."
01:39:57;01:40:02;"Hanging out in downtown Seattle, I swear there is a dude, I don't know if he's homeless,"
01:40:02;01:40:06;"but he's clearly a guy who spends most of his day on the street."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"Spoon Man."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Yeah, because Spoon Man was a famous dude, right?"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"Yeah."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"That's a Soundgarden song for people who don't know."
01:40:11;01:40:14;"And I swear I saw a guy, I was like, ""I've seen this guy every time I've come to Seattle."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"I haven't been there in six years."""
01:40:16;01:40:21;"Feel the rhythm with your hands."
01:40:21;01:40:26;"Spoon Man."
01:40:26;01:40:31;"Speak the rhythm on your own."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"Spoon Man."
01:40:33;01:40:37;"So anyway, Seattle, similar to San Francisco, I think is a tortured relationship with how"
01:40:37;01:40:42;"they treat people with no money and homeless people versus the explosion of real estate."
01:40:42;01:40:46;"But anyway, I was just like, Seattle kind of doesn't get drawn into the cultural conversation"
01:40:46;01:40:51;"the way SF does, but Seattle's actually, I hesitate to say more interesting, but it's"
01:40:51;01:40:56;"like all the dynamics that New York Times journalists use to talk about San Francisco"
01:40:56;01:40:59;"really play in Seattle in almost a more obvious way to me."
01:40:59;01:41:04;"I was just going to say, with all due respect to many of our favorite musicians, Seattle"
01:41:04;01:41:09;"might be like a more, maybe a bigger player on the world stage than SF."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"Oh, drop a bomb to that."
01:41:12;01:41:17;"Because SF just hasn't produced a coffee chain that's as big as Starbucks."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"Am I forgetting one?"
01:41:18;01:41:22;"I just keep thinking about Cafe Nervoso where Frazier and the gang would hang out and why"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"that didn't really blow up the way Starbucks did."
01:41:25;01:41:30;"Well, I found Seattle a little more, and again, this is just me in downtown with two days"
01:41:30;01:41:36;"off, I was on the one hand struck by the big money more than ever, which obviously is problematic"
01:41:36;01:41:41;"and worth examining, but I was also struck by how much I do love that area."
01:41:41;01:41:45;"The weather, the vibe, even going to that original Starbucks, I felt like I stepped"
01:41:45;01:41:50;"back in time for half a second and I was like, imagine being here in the seventies."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"1971."
01:41:51;01:41:55;"It's probably so funky down by like the fish market and stuff."
01:41:55;01:42:00;"But anyway, I still like Seattle, but I'm getting more and more curious about Seattle."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"This trip really triggered something in me."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"Seattle curious."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"I'm very Seattle curious."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"I need to grab a stranger."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"Were people talking about Seattle much in the fifties through the eighties, just in"
01:42:09;01:42:14;"the nineties out of nowhere, you got Nirvana, Soundgarden, Frazier, Starbucks explodes,"
01:42:14;01:42:17;"and Bill Gates suddenly becomes like the richest man on earth."
01:42:17;01:42:21;"Like that's a hell of a decade to put a city on the world map."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"It reminds me of what Huey was saying about Marin County growing up."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"It was all blue collar, right?"
01:42:25;01:42:29;"You know, same dynamic in the Bay Area, the Bay Area before Silicon Valley."
01:42:29;01:42:32;"And then think about Seattle before, yeah, 1980."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"This would be cool."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"If we had a time machine, this is what I'd like to do."
01:42:35;01:42:42;"I'd like to go to Paris 1975, walk down the Champs Elysees and see a well-to-do French"
01:42:42;01:42:46;"gentleman, pull him aside and say, Hey man, you ever heard of Seattle?"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"This is in 1975."
01:42:47;01:42:51;"I'd be curious to see what the average French gentleman taking a promenade."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Boeing airplane manufacturer?"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"You might've known Boeing or even 1965."
01:42:56;01:42:57;"So have you heard of San Francisco?"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"I think they would have."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Oh, for sure."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Do you know, have you heard of Seattle?"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"This small, small city in the Pacific Northwest?"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"In Oregon?"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"No, no."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Washington state."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"Okay."
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Yeah."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Why?"
01:43:10;01:43:15;"Versus like 1995 and then like 2019, like what are you as the average like gentleman"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"on the Champs Elysees now?"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Like if you heard of Seattle, but of course."
01:43:19;01:43:24;"In this scenario, are you changing your attire to blend into the setting or are you just"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"going as yourself?"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"I'm wearing like my normal clothes."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"Okay."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"Well, the Bergen stocks would be kind of a red flag in 75."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"But what he's wearing now, just like a nice red sweater."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Are you just talking about in terms of the time travel?"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."
01:43:37;01:43:42;"Like, do you look for something, an outfit that will make you a little bit more incognito"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"when you're back in the day or do you?"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"Well, yeah, I think the whole, okay."
01:43:45;01:43:49;"In the seventies, I would make sure that I looked appropriate because the whole point"
01:43:49;01:43:54;"is to find out if the guy is aware of Seattle, a guy who lives in a very famous world city"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"like Paris, if he's aware of Seattle."
01:43:56;01:44:01;"And if I stopped him in the first thing he said is like, what are these bubbles in your"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"shoes?"
01:44:02;01:44:06;"I've never seen this type of footwear before."
01:44:06;01:44:09;"It is a very futuristic."
01:44:09;01:44:13;"What is this swoosh on the side?"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Oh yeah."
01:44:15;01:44:22;"So I'm just saying if I was wearing some very techie Nikes, even if I was wearing a Patagonia"
01:44:22;01:44:29;"and he was just kind of like my friend, every day I walk on the Champs Elysees, I see all"
01:44:29;01:44:35;"of the latest fashion and I've never seen a material such as this type of sweater."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Some sort of synthetic polymer."
01:44:37;01:44:41;"What is this synthetic polymer that you're wearing?"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"I'd be like, okay, sir, that's besides the point."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Have you ever heard of Seattle?"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"I am sorry."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"The only thing I can think of is what you are wearing."
01:44:49;01:44:52;"I've never seen pants."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Yeah, I've got like my, my phone."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Oh dude."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"That's totally besides the point."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"I guess it's an easy change when you get there."
01:45:02;01:45:06;"You can just pop into a, have a dashery or whatever and just get a new look or it is"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"beside the point and I'm sorry."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"But now you got me thinking about something else."
01:45:10;01:45:15;"Just throwing on some real techie 2019 Nike running shoes with the bubbles and the f***ing"
01:45:15;01:45:21;"iridescent sheen and plastic and s*** and throw on a Patagonia and go back to like the"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"sixties."
01:45:22;01:45:31;"Head to toe Supreme with some Nikes and just roll up to the Grateful Dead house 1967 Haight"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Ashbury and just be like, what up?"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"iPhone 11 still in your hand?"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"Check this s*** out."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"Stunt on some hippies."
01:45:38;01:45:41;"The reason I was talking about Starbucks in the first place is because I think we should"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"actually go get some pumpkin spice lattes."
01:45:43;01:45:48;"I think now that the dust has settled, people made all their little jokes for the past."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"How long have people been making pumpkin spice latte jokes?"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"About 20, 30 years."
01:45:51;01:45:53;"It's an unimpeachable product."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Yeah."
01:45:54;01:45:58;"Basic white girls or whatever like pumpkin spice lattes."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"We know this."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"I guess basic people of all genders and races."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Is that true Seinfeld?"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Uh, sure."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"Is that the correct meme?"
01:46:08;01:46:09;"Oh yeah."
01:46:09;01:46:13;"The first pumpkin spice latte dropped in 2003."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Wow."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"It's been that long?"
01:46:15;01:46:18;"So they've been out for about 16 years and I think the meme has probably been out for"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"maybe more like 20."
01:46:20;01:46:23;"So I think now is kind of classic TC time."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"I think now we roll in and we'd really do a deep dive."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"You know, that's kind of fun."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Obviously shout out to winter."
01:46:29;01:46:33;"None of us are ever going to get to the level of Starbucks that he got to."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"And he's been killing it on Twitter."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"He's been killing it."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Oh no."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"Yeah."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"I check in every now and then."
01:46:38;01:46:42;"I follow winter, but you know, it could be a cool seasonal activity for people."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"Guys."
01:46:43;01:46:47;"I just thought of this as a great, if I, Lord forgive me."
01:46:47;01:46:52;"I'm about to brag about how great my ideas now, because most of us, we don't have the"
01:46:52;01:46:56;"grit and determination to be Starbucks people like winter."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"And some of us can't even probably don't have the time to plan a trip around Starbucks."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"How about this?"
01:47:02;01:47:06;"Every October you go pumpkin spice Starbucks."
01:47:06;01:47:09;"And that's something you could do on the weekend with your significant other."
01:47:09;01:47:14;"It could be a fun thing to take a kid to do rather than go down to the pumpkin patch or"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"go apple picking."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Cause even that's kind of a pain in the ass."
01:47:17;01:47:20;"You go pumpkin spice Starbucking."
01:47:20;01:47:25;"And I think that's kind of a sweet little fun seasonal way that a kind of more basic"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"person can get a taste of the Starbucks."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"This is a great idea."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Is it not?"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"300 calories per stop."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Yeah."
01:47:32;01:47:40;"You're down in like maybe 1200 to 2100 calories of pumpkin spice daily."
01:47:40;01:47:45;"That's why you go with a friend or a lover, a lover or a friend."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"You share it."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"I don't want to poke any holes."
01:47:47;01:47:52;"What is a brilliant idea obviously or pull at any threads, but what, how do you distinguish"
01:47:52;01:47:58;"the difference between just a run of the mill visit to Starbucks and pumpkin spice Starbucking?"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Okay."
01:47:59;01:48:03;"So obviously it's autumn and you're hitting as many locations as humanly possible."
01:48:03;01:48:04;"I see."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"So the multiple locations, you're not just making a Starbucks run."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"Oh, I was, see, this was what I was picturing."
01:48:07;01:48:08;"No, you're Starbucking."
01:48:08;01:48:12;"Well, but isn't Starbucking just going to Starbucks?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"No, Starbucking is about, it's about getting your numbers up."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Where have you been?"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"Well, I've been here."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"I mean, I've been largely very present."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"Hey Seinfeld, you ever heard of a guy called Winter?"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Have you ever listened to time crisis?"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"Winter and I, we've met and we're good friends."
01:48:24;01:48:30;"So you're pitching multiple visits to Starbucks throughout a limited period of time in a day"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"or something in the whole season."
01:48:32;01:48:37;"It's something you do for basically from October 1st until Thanksgiving."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"Got it."
01:48:38;01:48:44;"You and your, your friend or your lover, you get together and you say for the next 50 something"
01:48:44;01:48:48;"days, okay, we're going to try to hit as many Starbucks and drink as many pumpkin spice"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"lattes as humanly possible."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"Now, I like the idea of doing it with somebody else cause you would get a small pumpkin spice"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"latte and share it."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"That way you're not packing on the pounds."
01:48:57;01:49:01;"Although it could also, that adds another wrinkle if you don't eat any other food the"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"whole time."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"And look, realistically, you're not going to do it every day."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"It's more just like, Hey, it's Sunday."
01:49:06;01:49:10;"You know, like say you live in a New York city for instance, it's Sunday and it's like,"
01:49:10;01:49:14;"Hey, you know, uh, me and some of the gang, we're going to rent a car."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"Ching."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"We're going to drive upstate gas."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Ching."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"Stopping at Dunkin Donuts."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Ching."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"And we're going to, where are you guys going?"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"Hudson or Kingston?"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"Oh yeah."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"We're going all the way up to Hudson."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"Ching, Ching, Ching."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"And what are you going to do?"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"We're going to go apple picking."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"Ching, Ching."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"So then you're up there."
01:49:29;01:49:32;"You got to get up more apple cider donuts and stuff."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"And then you got to pay for the apples."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"Then you drive back."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"And so what did you do?"
01:49:37;01:49:40;"You spent $3,000 and you got a bag of apples."
01:49:40;01:49:44;"So next time somebody pitches you an idea like that, say, Oh, actually, you know what?"
01:49:44;01:49:48;"I'm going to do another kind of a autumn activity and I don't need to rent a car and I don't"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"need to go all the way upstate."
01:49:49;01:49:51;"I'm going to go pumpkin spice Starbucking."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"So maybe it's just something you do every Sunday."
01:49:53;01:49:58;"I don't know if winter would be down for this sort of like diluted version of what he's"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"devoted his life to."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"No, I don't know."
01:50:00;01:50:04;"Winter's on record as saying that he's, he's very open minded."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"He's all about like you could tailor Starbucking to you."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"It's about the journey too, dude."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"It's about the journey."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"That's winter's philosophy."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"It's the journey."
01:50:12;01:50:16;"Next time somebody asked me to go apple picking or go down to a pumpkin patch, I'm just going"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"to laugh in their face."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"I'm going to go PSS pumpkin spice Starbucking."
01:50:20;01:50:24;"All right, well we were going to do a top five, but this is a special occasion because"
01:50:24;01:50:27;"it's pumpkin spice Starbucking season and we had Huey Lewis on."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"So here's what we're going to do."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"We're going to do a top four."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Never did this before."
01:50:31;01:50:35;"Basically, we're going to compare the top two songs in 1985."
01:50:35;01:50:38;"That was the week that Huey Lewis first topped the charts."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"So we're going to listen to the top two songs from that and compare it to the top two songs"
01:50:41;01:50:42;"right now."
01:50:42;01:50:49;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:50:49;01:50:52;"Number two song right now, and I've also been kind of curious."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"I've seen some press about this."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"I haven't heard this song yet."
01:50:55;01:50:59;"This is a song called 10,000 hours by Dan and Shay and Justin Bieber."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Okay."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Inspired by the Malcolm Gladwell book."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Oh yeah, that's what I was thinking."
01:51:03;01:51:08;"The Malcolm Gladwell book claims that 10,000 hours is what it takes to become an expert"
01:51:08;01:51:09;"at something."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Yeah."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"Jake, have you been hosting the show for 10,000 hours?"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Are you a radio host expert now?"
01:51:15;01:51:18;"No, man, we are at 200 hours."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"About 200 hours."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"So we are well below."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"We're about 10,000 hours short."
01:51:23;01:51:26;"10,000 is a lot of hours."
01:51:26;01:51:29;"When you think of it, it'd be 5,000 episodes."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"We'll get there."
01:51:31;01:51:35;"If we were doing it every week, yeah, it still wouldn't be."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"It would be at 400."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"The title was inspired by a theory popularized by Malcolm Gladwell."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"You're right, Jake."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"Oh, wow."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"Let's listen to it."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Do you love the rain?"
01:51:44;01:51:48;"Does it make you dance when you're drunk with your friends at a party?"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"What's your favorite song?"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Does it make you smile?"
01:51:51;01:51:55;"Do you think of me when you close your eyes?"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"Tell me, what are you dreaming?"
01:51:58;01:52:02;"Everything I want to know it all."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"It's got meant to be vibes."
01:52:03;01:52:08;"I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more."
01:52:08;01:52:13;"If that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours."
01:52:13;01:52:19;"And I might never get there, but I'm going to try."
01:52:19;01:52:25;"If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life, I'm going to--"
01:52:25;01:52:29;"Taking this very cold and clinical approach to your relationship,"
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I've logged 10,000 hours with you."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"It's going great."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"Did you get your middle name from your grandma?"
01:52:36;01:52:41;"When you think about you forever now, do you think of me?"
01:52:41;01:52:46;"When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreaming?"
01:52:46;01:52:51;"Everything I want to know it all."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"It's just meant to be."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"10,000 hours."
01:52:55;01:53:00;"It's really not fair on first listen, but you sir are no meant to be."
01:53:00;01:53:05;"If there's going to be a country duo pairing with a non-country pop star,"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"I think it should be meant to be."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"Yeah."
01:53:08;01:53:09;"If it's meant to be."
01:53:09;01:53:14;"This is the most idiotic usage of the 10,000 hour thing."
01:53:14;01:53:18;"It's like, look, we've been dating for a while now, but we've only got 5,000 hours on the books."
01:53:18;01:53:22;"I think we're in a holding pattern until I really can sign off on this."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"How long would it take to get to 10,000 hours?"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"I don't think that long if you're spending a lot of time together."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"What's he actually saying?"
01:53:44;01:53:48;"I would spend 10,000 hours if and 10,000 more."
01:53:48;01:53:55;"He's willing to go up to 20,000 if that's what it takes to learn that sweetheart of yours."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"He should want to spend that."
01:53:57;01:54:02;"If he's in love with someone, he shouldn't really be worrying about the hours."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Listen, I'll give you 10,000."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"Beyond that, I'll give you another 10,000."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"There's something off about this."
01:54:08;01:54:12;"There's something very wrong with this song."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"I normally don't go in on songs, but they're coming from meant to be."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"That's not cool."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"It doesn't track."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Jake, are you saying that you can't quantify love?"
01:54:20;01:54:24;"No, you can't, but that's not what Jake's saying, I don't think."
01:54:24;01:54:28;"Okay, you know how you work like a 40-hour work week that's like the standard thing?"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Not anymore."
01:54:29;01:54:35;"So let's say you're like dating someone and you've just moved in."
01:54:35;01:54:39;"How many hours a week are you actually spending together outside of sleeping?"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"Oh, well, that's actually a great question."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Because it might be about 40."
01:54:42;01:54:46;"Let's say you got Saturday and Sunday and you're going to Trader Joe's, you're doing apple picking."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"We got the pumpkin spice Starbucks."
01:54:49;01:54:54;"Let's say you got 24 hours over the weekend, Saturday and Sunday."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"Sleep should probably count at a lower rate."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"Okay, you want to like prorate that."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"Yeah, but okay, just for argument's sake."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"But during the week, you're maybe getting like maybe an hour in the morning."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"Let's say like you're both working normal jobs."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"In some ways, that's generous."
01:55:07;01:55:08;"An hour in the morning and then--"
01:55:08;01:55:11;"Because a lot of people are just hitting that alarm and being like, ""Be quiet."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"I'm still sleeping."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"I have another 20 minutes."""
01:55:14;01:55:15;"Yeah, exactly."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"But what about what the sleep represents?"
01:55:17;01:55:18;"Like it's so intimate."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Okay, so we can prorate the sleep."
01:55:19;01:55:24;"But let's say an hour of being awake and then maybe like four or five hours at night."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Right."
01:55:25;01:55:33;"So you got like 50 and you want to prorate the sleep about 60 hours a week with your significant other."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"So we're up to 60 hours a week."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Okay, so you're doing $240 a month."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"What is that?"
01:55:37;01:55:41;"Like $14,000 for the year-- no, $1,400 for the year?"
01:55:41;01:55:45;"Yeah, it would take you 8 to 10 years maybe."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Well, then maybe there's some periods of being unemployed."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Seinfeld is literally crunching numbers right now."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Now!"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Let's get a number crunch."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"7.14 years."
01:55:58;01:56:01;"Okay, let's be very generous and say five years."
01:56:01;01:56:04;"It'll take you five years to log those 10,000 hours."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"I just logged 10,000 hours."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"You and--"
01:56:07;01:56:08;"With Hannah, yeah."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"You've been together five years?"
01:56:09;01:56:10;"Yeah."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"I should give her a card."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Honey?"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"I've logged 10,000 hours."
01:56:14;01:56:21;"No, but even outside of the numbers, which is fascinating, I think what Jake is saying,"
01:56:21;01:56:30;"Seinfeld, is that I guess it kind of makes sense, but it's like a little bit silly because"
01:56:30;01:56:35;"theoretically, if you love somebody, you enjoy spending time with them."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"Now, whatever, there might be disagreements or something, but on the whole, you enjoy"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"spending time with them."
01:56:39;01:56:46;"So it's kind of like, baby, if I had to spend 10,000 hours with you to understand you better,"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"I would."
01:56:47;01:56:49;"It's just like a weird way of putting it."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"It's sort of like, aren't you doing that already?"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"You're like, well, yeah, guess what, guys?"
01:56:53;01:56:56;"The good news is you don't even have to worry about the time because that's what happens."
01:56:56;01:57:00;"You enjoy spending time with somebody and you get to know them better at the same time."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"Life goes by, man."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"In fact, the whole way that you're putting it is making me uncomfortable."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"It's a very neoliberal paradigm, man."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"It's very neoliberal, man."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"You're kind of making it sound like you don't want to spend the 10,000 hours."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"No, no, no."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"I am happy to."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"I would."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"Yeah, you know, you keep saying you would."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"There's something really f***ing off about this song."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"What's up with Dan and Shay too?"
01:57:19;01:57:20;"Are they YouTubers?"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"[laughter]"
01:57:22;01:57:25;"That was the most old person you've ever sounded on this show."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"Are they YouTubers?"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"Do you know what this song reminds me?"
01:57:29;01:57:32;"Do you know the Proclaimers' ""I'm Gonna Be 500 Miles""?"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"Sure."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Most annoying song ever created?"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"I wouldn't say that."
01:57:35;01:57:36;"It's so annoying."
01:57:36;01:57:37;"Have you seen the video?"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"Those two twins who are like--"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"Yeah."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"Oh, yeah, but they're cool, man."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"I like them."
01:57:41;01:57:42;"That's a dope song."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"All right, maybe they're cool."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"Go to hell."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"[laughter]"
01:57:45;01:57:46;"This is the Seinfeld--"
01:57:46;01:57:51;"I mean, we had this kind of loose story arc where the second 100 episodes,"
01:57:51;01:57:54;"Seinfeld's declined."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Just let it happen organically, guys."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"Fall from grace."
01:57:57;01:57:58;"Just let it happen naturally."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Well, it's happening."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"Joker origin story."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"[laughter]"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"I mean, I love the refiner."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"No, but that's a great song."
01:58:04;01:58:08;"And I would walk 500 miles."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"See, that's actually saying something."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"That actually is like--"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"Although, it is funny how circular it is."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"Why would you walk 500 miles?"
01:58:14;01:58:18;"Just to be the man who'd walk 500 miles to end up at your door."
01:58:18;01:58:22;"I would walk 500 miles just to be--"
01:58:22;01:58:23;"Okay, no, that does track."
01:58:23;01:58:26;"But that's like a physically demanding feat."
01:58:26;01:58:29;"I would do something demanding and borderline pointless"
01:58:29;01:58:34;"just to be the guy who did it on the off chance that that might impress you"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"or make me more special in your eyes."
01:58:36;01:58:37;"Yeah, that tracks."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"You're doing 10 miles a day."
01:58:39;01:58:41;"It's going to take you 50 days."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"It's going to take you almost two months to walk that 500."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"Jake, you on YouTube?"
01:58:45;01:58:46;"Mountain Bruce."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"American painter and YouTuber."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"[laughter]"
01:58:49;01:58:53;"Jake, what if you embraced that moniker, like really went full YouTube?"
01:58:53;01:58:56;"Like just started doing challenges and stuff?"
01:58:56;01:58:57;"Like videos in the car."
01:58:57;01:58:58;"Vlogs."
01:58:58;01:58:59;"[laughter]"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"Hey, what's up, guys?"
01:59:01;01:59:04;"Dashboard mounted iPhone videos."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"Just wearing Oakley's."
01:59:05;01:59:06;"What's up, guys?"
01:59:06;01:59:10;"Jake here, American painter, radio personality, and YouTuber."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"So I got something on my mind."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"Okay, are Dan and Shay YouTubers?"
01:59:14;01:59:15;"Oh, God."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"I mean--"
01:59:16;01:59:17;"I think Justin Bieber's a YouTuber."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"Justin Bieber's a YouTuber, right?"
01:59:19;01:59:20;"He's on YouTube."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"I wouldn't call him a YouTuber."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"But he started as a YouTuber, right?"
01:59:22;01:59:23;"That's how you got to start, right?"
01:59:23;01:59:24;"Oh, yeah, I guess so."
01:59:24;01:59:25;"He's a YouTuber."
01:59:25;01:59:31;"So he really navigated his voice breaking very gracefully, I would say, Justin Bieber."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"That's true."
01:59:32;01:59:33;"Do you remember when he first came out?"
01:59:33;01:59:34;"Yeah."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Very high-pitched."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"Yeah."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"It was seamless."
01:59:37;01:59:40;"In his documentary, he also, when he was probably going through puberty, he was struggling with"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"his voice."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"He almost lost his voice in that doc."
01:59:42;01:59:44;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:59:44;01:59:46;"They're an American country music duo."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"And YouTubers?"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"It doesn't say--"
01:59:48;01:59:49;"I mean--"
01:59:49;01:59:50;"What does it say on Wikipedia?"
01:59:50;01:59:51;"What's the first line?"
01:59:51;01:59:52;"It just says they're an American country music duo."
01:59:52;01:59:54;"Dan plus Shay, by the way."
01:59:54;01:59:55;"It's stylized as a plus sign."
01:59:55;02:00:00;"OK, I'm going to need you to edit it and add American country music duo and YouTubers."
02:00:00;02:00:04;"I mean, I don't know how-- these Wikipedia editors, they're pretty quick."
02:00:04;02:00:05;"They'll switch it back."
02:00:05;02:00:06;"But I'll give it a shot."
02:00:06;02:00:09;"But you just showed them the link to all their videos they have on YouTube."
02:00:09;02:00:13;"I guess I could do an attribution, like a footnote to their YouTube page."
02:00:13;02:00:17;"You've never really gotten in the mix with editing Wikipedia?"
02:00:17;02:00:18;"You know what I'll do is I'll troll people."
02:00:18;02:00:21;"I'll add my friend to a band or something."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"I'll be like, oh, I didn't know you were in this."
02:00:23;02:00:24;"And I'll send them a link."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"Yeah."
02:00:25;02:00:26;"But now it's really fast."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"I used to do that more--"
02:00:27;02:00:28;"So now you have to screenshot it or something?"
02:00:28;02:00:29;"I have to screenshot it."
02:00:29;02:00:30;"That's kind of lame."
02:00:30;02:00:31;"Yeah, it's not as cool as it used to be."
02:00:31;02:00:32;"Not as fun."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"OK, but this isn't a joke."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"No, no, this is real."
02:00:34;02:00:37;"Add YouTubers to every musical artist who has a YouTube channel."
02:00:37;02:00:40;"Should I make Jake a YouTuber on Wikipedia as well?"
02:00:40;02:00:41;"That might stay."
02:00:41;02:00:44;"That would stay, because I have a very low traffic Wikipedia entry, I'm sure."
02:00:44;02:00:49;"Wait, wait, oh, you know, by the way, I went on Ira Madison's podcast, Keep It, and check"
02:00:49;02:00:50;"out their podcast."
02:00:50;02:00:53;"Did you just change my Wikipedia, dude?"
02:00:53;02:00:54;"I'm in the middle of it right now."
02:00:54;02:00:55;"Oh, my God."
02:00:55;02:00:56;"I'm putting YouTube--"
02:00:56;02:00:57;"Actually, can you please not do that?"
02:00:57;02:00:58;"You don't want to be a YouTuber?"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"No, actually, I don't want that on there, because it will stay on there."
02:01:00;02:01:01;"Oh, because here's the thing I was going to say."
02:01:01;02:01:08;"So I don't know if this was on the show or afterwards, but I was talking to Ira."
02:01:08;02:01:11;"He also is like a TV writer, and his background is as a playwright."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"Oh, wow."
02:01:12;02:01:15;"I was asking him about that, and he was telling me about it, that that's his background."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"And he's like, you do play stuff, too?"
02:01:17;02:01:18;"And I was like, no, what do you mean?"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"And I was like, are you thinking like the cartoon?"
02:01:20;02:01:24;"He's like, no, no, no, I know about that, but you also have like a playwright thing."
02:01:24;02:01:25;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
02:01:25;02:01:29;"And then he said something that he's like, I could have sworn in our documents when we"
02:01:29;02:01:32;"were preparing to have you on the show, something said you were a playwright."
02:01:32;02:01:34;"And then I was like, I had this vague memory."
02:01:34;02:01:38;"Is that a time crisis thing about changing my Wikipedia to say playwright?"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"It's in the first sentence of your Wikipedia."
02:01:40;02:01:41;"Really?"
02:01:41;02:01:42;"And nobody's changed it?"
02:01:42;02:01:45;"Singer, songwriter, record producer, playwright, and radio personality."
02:01:45;02:01:46;"Wow."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"Don't look at me."
02:01:47;02:01:48;"I didn't do that."
02:01:48;02:01:51;"So nobody's really checking to keep mine accurate."
02:01:51;02:01:52;"I guess not."
02:01:52;02:01:53;"Yeah."
02:01:53;02:01:54;"There's no footnote."
02:01:54;02:01:55;"There's no attribution."
02:01:55;02:01:56;"All right."
02:01:56;02:01:57;"So that's hilarious."
02:01:57;02:01:59;"Very vulnerable Wikipedia."
02:01:59;02:02:00;"Although I'm not mad at it."
02:02:00;02:02:01;"It's classy."
02:02:01;02:02:02;"Yeah, that's a good look."
02:02:02;02:02:04;"I don't want YouTube on my Wikipedia."
02:02:04;02:02:05;"I've stopped that."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"And listeners."
02:02:06;02:02:07;"Oh, don't pull."
02:02:07;02:02:08;"Oh, yeah."
02:02:09;02:02:12;"These are the same listeners that added eight minute Cape Cod at G. Bill Cobb to like every"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"single brand on Twitter."
02:02:14;02:02:15;"You don't want to stoke these people."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"Oh, no."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"What do you mean every single bootleg merch?"
02:02:19;02:02:23;"No, like when we first got the email address, there was a point where suddenly I'm getting"
02:02:23;02:02:27;"like Burger King, New Zealand and Ed Sheeran's mailing list."
02:02:27;02:02:28;"Oh, yeah."
02:02:28;02:02:29;"Sounds vaguely familiar."
02:02:29;02:02:30;"Whatever."
02:02:30;02:02:32;"They're not going to troll you the way they trolled."
02:02:32;02:02:33;"You know what?"
02:02:33;02:02:37;"If we do like a time crisis movie, if we do like our Mr. America, one of the plot line"
02:02:37;02:02:41;"could be that like me and Jake have like a big falling out or something."
02:02:41;02:02:44;"And it's like about like the future of time crisis hangs in the balance."
02:02:44;02:02:49;"And it could be like we make the poster like Alien vs. Predator, but it's Painter vs. Playwright."
02:02:49;02:02:53;"It's like us like with knives out."
02:02:53;02:02:56;"There's something very rich about this Painter vs. Playwright."
02:02:56;02:02:59;"Time crisis colon Painter vs. Playwright."
02:02:59;02:03:02;"It's a brawl for it all."
02:03:02;02:03:07;"Anyway, now I kind of feel bad going in on this song because the truth is it's a pretty"
02:03:07;02:03:08;"good song."
02:03:08;02:03:11;"It's just it's just not as good as meant to be yet."
02:03:11;02:03:17;"And anyway, Dan and Shay performed the song with Bieber at his wedding reception."
02:03:17;02:03:20;"So you know, this is an important song to him."
02:03:20;02:03:24;"That's Jake said it's kind of a funny way to kick off a marriage, but to each his own."
02:03:24;02:03:31;"Anyway, the number two song back in 85, the Huey Lewis year was Tears for Fears."
02:03:31;02:03:32;"Another duo."
02:03:32;02:03:33;"They probably have a YouTube."
02:03:33;02:03:34;"Their number two song is called Shout."
02:03:34;02:03:47;"The song is written in my room on just a small synthesizer and a drum machine."
02:03:47;02:03:50;"Initially I only had the chorus, which is very repetitive, like a mantra."
02:03:50;02:03:52;"I mean, tears for fears rules."
02:03:52;02:03:59;"They wrote some big old songs."
02:03:59;02:04:03;"A lot of people think that shout is just another song about primal scream theory, continuing"
02:04:03;02:04:04;"the themes of the first album."
02:04:04;02:04:07;"It is actually more concerned with political protest."
02:04:07;02:04:10;"It came out in 1984 when a lot of people were still worried about the aftermath of the Cold"
02:04:10;02:04:14;"War and was basically an encouragement to protest."
02:04:14;02:04:19;"I mean, it's pretty amazing to think this song is like number two, 1984."
02:04:19;02:04:23;"Just picture like a few years earlier, just like this must have sounded so futuristic."
02:04:23;02:04:27;"Yeah, I mean, it makes me think of Huey with the drum machine."
02:04:27;02:04:29;"I wonder if his drummer was bummed."
02:04:29;02:04:33;"I should have asked him that next time."
02:04:33;02:04:35;"Yeah, it was early eighties, man."
02:04:35;02:04:38;"That was a real trial by fire for rock dudes."
02:04:38;02:04:40;"Not everybody made it through."
02:04:40;02:04:41;"Yeah."
02:04:41;02:04:42;"And that Chicago doc."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"Oh yeah."
02:04:43;02:04:44;"They go deep into that."
02:04:44;02:04:48;"Like the guys that were playing, you know, like the horn players and stuff were super"
02:04:48;02:04:49;"resentful."
02:04:49;02:04:55;"To Huey's credit, he managed to incorporate drum machines and synths without alienating"
02:04:55;02:04:56;"his horn player."
02:04:56;02:05:02;"I guess it wasn't a whole horn section, but you know, still prominent saxophone."
02:05:02;02:05:04;"But yeah, great team leader."
02:05:04;02:05:05;"Yeah."
02:05:05;02:05:08;"You know, one thing I wish we asked Huey, why is it called sports?"
02:05:08;02:05:10;"I've always been curious."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"Why is that called sports?"
02:05:12;02:05:13;"Although this is my theory."
02:05:13;02:05:16;"Huey, if you're listening, you can tell us if this is totally off base."
02:05:16;02:05:22;"I wonder because he's clearly, it was a major decision point moment making that album kind"
02:05:22;02:05:23;"of new."
02:05:23;02:05:24;"We have to nail this."
02:05:24;02:05:25;"It has to be big singles."
02:05:25;02:05:27;"It has to be something that like fits top 40 radio."
02:05:27;02:05:31;"I wonder if he was just like, what's something that everybody likes?"
02:05:31;02:05:32;"Sports music."
02:05:32;02:05:35;"Yeah, that's the Trump answer."
02:05:35;02:05:36;"Music."
02:05:36;02:05:38;"But he's probably like, we're competing with all genres."
02:05:38;02:05:39;"We just have to nail this."
02:05:39;02:05:45;"This has to be very appealing, has to be fresh, modern, palatable, and just like sports."
02:05:45;02:05:48;"And maybe that's some of that bitter, cynical humor."
02:05:48;02:05:53;"You think of music as like the opposite of like athletics and like jocks and stuff."
02:05:53;02:05:56;"It's like, it is kind of punk to be like, you know what?"
02:05:56;02:05:58;"It's called sports."
02:05:58;02:06:02;"Yeah, it kind of goes along with his sense of humor to be like sports."
02:06:02;02:06:03;"The album was called hockey."
02:06:03;02:06:05;"Like just weird."
02:06:05;02:06:06;"See, right."
02:06:06;02:06:10;"See, hockey, that wouldn't, the crazy thing that he had to do in this moment was make"
02:06:10;02:06:16;"something that worked on kind of the most brutal, exclusionary top 40 radio world that"
02:06:16;02:06:18;"had ever existed up until that point."
02:06:18;02:06:21;"So calling it hockey, that'd be like making a country song."
02:06:21;02:06:22;"That's too niche."
02:06:22;02:06:23;"Yeah."
02:06:23;02:06:24;"Sports."
02:06:25;02:06:26;"Which sports?"
02:06:26;02:06:27;"Athletics."
02:06:27;02:06:28;"All of them."
02:06:28;02:06:32;"So the number one song in our era, 2019, Travis Scott, major artist."
02:06:32;02:06:35;"Vampire Weekends played right before him multiple times this year."
02:06:35;02:06:36;"Festivals."
02:06:36;02:06:39;"Actually, we went up against him at Music Midtown in Atlanta."
02:06:39;02:06:40;"Proud to say we held our own."
02:06:40;02:06:43;"Although his stage was so loud."
02:06:43;02:06:45;"I feel like we were playing like something kind of quiet."
02:06:45;02:06:49;"Like, you know, during a festival set, obviously we're not like crazy."
02:06:49;02:06:51;"We don't do like a whole run of ballads or anything."
02:06:51;02:06:55;"But I think we just like put in one Hannah Hunt and just remember like starting like"
02:06:55;02:07:01;"real quiet, like, and I just hear like, like, but it's all good."
02:07:01;02:07:02;"How dare he?"
02:07:02;02:07:03;"No, he was having a good time."
02:07:03;02:07:04;"I'm just glad that we had an audience."
02:07:04;02:07:06;"I don't think I've ever heard his music."
02:07:06;02:07:09;"You never heard like, I get those goosebumps every time."
02:07:09;02:07:10;"Come around."
02:07:10;02:07:11;"Maybe."
02:07:11;02:07:13;"He had a lot of big hits."
02:07:13;02:07:16;"Anyway, this is a new single."
02:07:16;02:07:22;"Do you know who his former partner is that he has a daughter with?"
02:07:22;02:07:23;"I don't."
02:07:23;02:07:24;"Kylie Jenner."
02:07:24;02:07:25;"Okay."
02:07:25;02:07:26;"She's a YouTuber."
02:07:26;02:07:27;"That means nothing to me."
02:07:27;02:07:31;"But American rapper and YouTuber Travis Scott."
02:07:31;02:07:33;"Also say that he spent time in Calabasas."
02:07:33;02:07:36;"Oh yeah, he probably lives there."
02:07:36;02:07:38;"Actually Jonah Hill directed his music video."
02:07:38;02:07:39;"Right."
02:07:39;02:07:40;"Oh yeah, right."
02:07:40;02:07:41;"Jonah did a video for him."
02:07:41;02:07:44;"According to Kazim Pahdin, some fans believe that Travis and Kylie broke up as part of"
02:07:44;02:07:47;"a PR stunt to promote his new music."
02:07:47;02:07:48;"So what's the story Seinfeld?"
02:07:48;02:07:51;"Oh, on Kylie and Travis."
02:07:51;02:07:56;"Well, Kylie was seen shortly after their breakup at Tyga's music studio."
02:07:56;02:07:58;"I don't know if you remember that."
02:07:58;02:07:59;"Oh yeah, that's her ex-boyfriend."
02:07:59;02:08:01;"Yeah, it seemed like she had sort of rebounded."
02:08:01;02:08:03;"Is it a rebound when you go back to your ex?"
02:08:03;02:08:05;"No, rebound is a sports term."
02:08:05;02:08:07;"From basketball, I think."
02:08:07;02:08:08;"Okay."
02:08:08;02:08:09;"It was a debound."
02:08:09;02:08:11;"I mean, maybe they were just getting lunch or something."
02:08:11;02:08:12;"Yeah."
02:08:12;02:08:13;"3am Jake?"
02:08:13;02:08:14;"What, was it that late?"
02:08:14;02:08:15;"Oh yeah."
02:08:15;02:08:20;"No, but also if it was in fact a PR stunt, that's what you would do to drive it home."
02:08:20;02:08:24;"I mean, Travis, he's always got pretty good tasteful singles."
02:08:24;02:08:25;"What do you think Jake?"
02:08:25;02:08:26;"I love this."
02:08:26;02:08:27;"Really?"
02:08:27;02:08:28;"No."
02:08:28;02:08:31;"I mean, it's fine."
02:08:31;02:08:32;"It's completely innocuous."
02:08:32;02:08:34;"You would dislike this one."
02:08:34;02:08:36;"Have you heard Sicko Mode?"
02:08:36;02:08:37;"That's a good song."
02:08:37;02:08:38;"Maybe, maybe in the top five."
02:08:38;02:08:39;"Yeah, might have been."
02:08:39;02:08:40;"Maybe."
02:08:40;02:08:46;"Sicko Mode's got that fake out intro where you've got Drake on it and then the song suddenly"
02:08:46;02:08:47;"changes."
02:08:47;02:08:50;"Yeah, it's got a famous beat switch up."
02:08:50;02:08:51;"I watched Travis Scott."
02:08:51;02:08:54;"He played right after us at a Hangout Fest in Alabama."
02:08:54;02:08:56;"And I thought he seemed like a great performer."
02:08:56;02:09:00;"He had some really advanced video technology."
02:09:00;02:09:03;"Like they'd show him on the screens and they'd have all these crazy filters."
02:09:03;02:09:05;"Like at one point he's like on fire."
02:09:05;02:09:08;"And I was like, that's pretty good."
02:09:08;02:09:14;"Yeah, his music videos are pretty, you know, he's playing with filmic techniques as well."
02:09:14;02:09:17;"Yeah, he's very talented and he's doing a great job with his career."
02:09:17;02:09:21;"So if you and Kylie actually broke up, I'm sorry to hear it."
02:09:21;02:09:27;"If it's a PR stunt, I hope the PR brings you all the press that you were looking for."
02:09:27;02:09:28;"Good luck with your career."
02:09:28;02:09:29;"Good luck with your career."
02:09:29;02:09:33;"So this week, sitting on top of the world is Travis Scott."
02:09:33;02:09:35;"But it's a little bit different."
02:09:35;02:09:41;"34 years ago, 1985, in the Travis Scott position was our new friend, Huey Lewis with The Power"
02:09:41;02:09:42;"of Love."
02:09:42;02:10:11;"So this song was for Back to the Future."
02:10:11;02:10:16;"And he's like skateboarding around Burbank like with the hoverboard."
02:10:16;02:10:17;"No, no, no."
02:10:17;02:10:18;"This is regular 85."
02:10:18;02:10:19;"Oh, straight up."
02:10:19;02:10:23;"Grabbing the back of a pickup truck with the I remember there's this one guy."
02:10:23;02:10:25;"He's on the skateboard and grabs his Jeep."
02:10:25;02:10:29;"And this guy and the driver, there's like one quick shot of the driver turns around."
02:10:29;02:10:31;"He's got this like awesome old school Mountain Dew hat."
02:10:31;02:10:32;"He's like, what the hell?"
02:10:32;02:11:02;"All right, movie idea."
02:11:02;02:11:05;"Opens 2019 Calabasas."
02:11:05;02:11:10;"Travis Scott's skateboarding around and then blah, blah, blah."
02:11:10;02:11:11;"He ends up back in 1985."
02:11:11;02:11:13;"I love where you're at right now."
02:11:13;02:11:16;"He wakes up and it's August 1985."
02:11:16;02:11:19;"And then he runs outside and he's just like, what the hell?"
02:11:19;02:11:20;"Everything looks weird."
02:11:20;02:11:24;"He grabs somebody goes, hey, what's the number one song in the country?"
02:11:24;02:11:30;"And they say The Power of Love by Huey Lewis in the news, of course, because this is 1985."
02:11:30;02:11:34;"I don't know what the next part is, but obviously be cool if he has to link up with Huey."
02:11:34;02:11:37;"Well, who produced the Travis Scott song?"
02:11:37;02:11:39;"But Travis Scott produces all his own songs."
02:11:39;02:11:41;"That's what I'm saying, because he needs his Doc Brown."
02:11:41;02:11:46;"He needs to go find whoever his mentor in the music industry is now."
02:11:46;02:11:47;"Kanye, who's an older guy."
02:11:47;02:11:48;"Kanye, Kanye, Kanye, Kanye, like wild hair."
02:11:48;02:11:49;"Like, well, Kanye's only eight."
02:11:49;02:11:50;"He's not gonna be able to help him."
02:11:50;02:11:51;"Well, Doc Brown."
02:11:51;02:11:52;"What?"
02:11:52;02:11:53;"Oh, Kanye would only be a child."
02:11:53;02:12:05;"Marty goes back to 1955 and he finds Doc Brown when he's like in his 30s or 40s."
02:12:05;02:12:06;"Yeah."
02:12:06;02:12:12;"He has to go back in time and find a 27 year old Kris Jenner."
02:12:12;02:12:13;"Yes."
02:12:13;02:12:19;"Actually, that could be really good because he's like in 2019, she's all pissed off at"
02:12:19;02:12:20;"him."
02:12:20;02:12:21;"Wow."
02:12:21;02:12:24;"You broke up with Kylie or whatever."
02:12:24;02:12:26;"He's trying to think like, who do I know in LA?"
02:12:26;02:12:27;"OJ?"
02:12:27;02:12:29;"Then you bring in OJ."
02:12:29;02:12:31;"It's even getting better and better actually."
02:12:31;02:12:32;"Oh, it's set against the murder trial?"
02:12:32;02:12:33;"Well, no, it's the 80s."
02:12:33;02:12:34;"It's a full 10 years before."
02:12:34;02:12:35;"Oh, okay, okay."
02:12:35;02:12:36;"But Travis knows."
02:12:36;02:12:37;"That's true."
02:12:37;02:12:38;"Travis knows what's gonna happen."
02:12:38;02:12:42;"He can warn OJ not to do the murder."
02:12:42;02:12:43;"Maybe."
02:12:43;02:12:44;"That's a funny concept."
02:12:44;02:12:46;"Warn someone to not murder someone."
02:12:46;02:12:47;"Wait, why?"
02:12:47;02:12:49;"Do I not get away with it?"
02:12:49;02:12:50;"Well, sort of."
02:12:50;02:13:07;"I can't quite crack it, but there's something really good about back in '85, Power Love"
02:13:07;02:13:08;"is blasting."
02:13:08;02:13:09;"How old was Kris Jenner in 1985?"
02:13:09;02:13:13;"Why don't I do like a number crunch?"
02:13:13;02:13:16;"Okay, she's 63 now."
02:13:16;02:13:17;"You can guess, man."
02:13:17;02:13:19;"She's six years younger than Kiwi."
02:13:19;02:13:20;"She's 34."
02:13:20;02:13:22;"So 63 minus 34."
02:13:22;02:13:23;"She's 30."
02:13:23;02:13:24;"29, 30."
02:13:24;02:13:28;"Maybe he's like, he wakes up in Beverly Hills, Power Love is blasting, and then he just sees"
02:13:28;02:13:31;"like super fine 30 year old Kris Jenner."
02:13:31;02:13:34;"He's like, ""Whoa!"""
02:13:34;02:13:36;"But then Robert Kardashian walks out."
02:13:36;02:13:38;"That's like when Marty goes on a date with his mom."
02:13:38;02:13:41;"Yeah, except it's his ex-girlfriend's mom."
02:13:41;02:13:46;"And then he goes to New York and he finds Trump and he's like, ""Just keep doing you,"
02:13:46;02:13:47;"man."
02:13:47;02:13:49;"Whatever you're doing, you're going places."""
02:13:49;02:13:52;"A lot of implications in this film."
02:13:52;02:13:55;"Time machine concepts are, they're super fun."
02:13:55;02:13:56;"They're very fun."
02:13:56;02:13:57;"How do we..."
02:13:57;02:14:00;"I wish they had made more movies, like more fun movies about time travel."
02:14:00;02:14:02;"How do we work Huey Lewis then?"
02:14:02;02:14:04;"Wait, to the Travis Scott story?"
02:14:04;02:14:05;"Yeah."
02:14:05;02:14:08;"I think he's just more of a presence over the whole film."
02:14:08;02:14:11;"I mean, he's at the top of his game in '85."
02:14:11;02:14:15;"He's not like a character, but it's like Huey Lewis's greatest hits are kind of the soundtrack"
02:14:15;02:14:17;"to the movie."
02:14:17;02:14:21;"And then there's like one cameo towards the end where Travis Scott, like, I guess he kind"
02:14:21;02:14:26;"of pulls like the Beatles movie where Travis Scott just starts like inventing new types"
02:14:26;02:14:27;"of music and stuff."
02:14:27;02:14:28;"And he becomes like a major."
02:14:28;02:14:29;"Oh yeah."
02:14:29;02:14:33;"Travis Scott could just like, just write like the chronic or something."
02:14:33;02:14:34;"Yeah."
02:14:34;02:14:37;"Like seven years early or whatever it was."
02:14:37;02:14:38;"Right smells like teen spirit."
02:14:38;02:14:39;"Yeah."
02:14:39;02:14:40;"I'm sure he knows that song."
02:14:40;02:14:42;"And then he ends up like at the Grammys or something."
02:14:42;02:14:46;"And there's some, some moment where he was like, Hey kid, good job."
02:14:46;02:14:48;"I don't know."
02:14:48;02:14:49;"Stay fresh."
02:14:49;02:14:52;"What if he just wrote all of Huey Lewis's future hits?"
02:14:52;02:14:54;"Is that two on the nose?"
02:14:54;02:14:57;"You're imagining a universe where he approaches Huey."
02:14:57;02:14:59;"Where Huey Lewis put out sicko mode in 1988."
02:14:59;02:15:02;"No, I'm thinking the opposite."
02:15:02;02:15:08;"Travis Scott anticipates all the future Huey Lewis songs and writes them before Huey Lewis"
02:15:08;02:15:09;"can."
02:15:09;02:15:10;"I don't know."
02:15:11;02:15:12;"I'm not that familiar with Travis Scott is with his like late eighties output."
02:15:12;02:15:13;"Yeah."
02:15:13;02:15:17;"Um, might be a little, also that would be psychotic too, because maybe Huey had some"
02:15:17;02:15:20;"of that stuff already written, but it wasn't released."
02:15:20;02:15:24;"So then someone comes to you and plays the song to you that only you know."
02:15:24;02:15:25;"Well, remember he said it himself."
02:15:25;02:15:27;"He had to rush out the next album."
02:15:27;02:15:30;"Pressure was on from the label."
02:15:30;02:15:31;"Probably didn't have those hits in the bank."
02:15:31;02:15:33;"Down to rabbit hole here folks."
02:15:33;02:15:36;"And that's the power of love."
02:15:36;02:15:38;"So that's Huey's biggest hit."
02:15:38;02:15:40;"What Huey songs are you the most familiar with Jake?"
02:15:40;02:15:43;"If this is it, please let me know."
02:15:43;02:15:45;"That might be my favorite."
02:15:45;02:15:46;"I used to have some like video."
02:15:46;02:15:50;"I don't know what it was like, you know, like when you're like a little kid in the eighties,"
02:15:50;02:15:51;"you just have like tapes."
02:15:51;02:15:53;"That was like a really funny era."
02:15:53;02:15:57;"Cause you just be like six just, I guess it was the nineties by the time I was six, but"
02:15:57;02:16:01;"you just like some where it's like before there was this kind of like new monoculture."
02:16:01;02:16:02;"It's funny."
02:16:02;02:16:05;"People talk about like the old monoculture, but by like the eighties and nineties, there's"
02:16:05;02:16:11;"enough random stuff on TV and more channels and stuff that it was actually less of a monoculture"
02:16:11;02:16:13;"in a way than it is now in the internet era."
02:16:13;02:16:17;"Cause I feel like that'd be some thing where you just be like talking with somebody at"
02:16:17;02:16:18;"school."
02:16:18;02:16:19;"Like have you ever seen whatever?"
02:16:19;02:16:25;"And it would be like, yeah, that was a, a Halloween special aired on ABC in 1988 once."
02:16:25;02:16:27;"You know what I mean?"
02:16:27;02:16:28;"There's just like random stuff like that."
02:16:28;02:16:29;"So I don't even know."
02:16:29;02:16:33;"I just feel like I go to some other kid's house and they'd just be like, I very distinctly"
02:16:33;02:16:37;"remember going over somebody said, I was like, have you ever seen the far side?"
02:16:37;02:16:38;"And I was like, Oh yeah."
02:16:38;02:16:39;"Like those comics."
02:16:39;02:16:41;"It's like, yeah, I got, I have one of those books."
02:16:41;02:16:44;"My grandma got me a far side book for my birthday."
02:16:44;02:16:46;"Like you never, you never saw the show."
02:16:46;02:16:47;"I was like, what show?"
02:16:47;02:16:50;"And it was like a far side cartoon special that was like on TV once."
02:16:50;02:16:51;"Right."
02:16:51;02:16:53;"And he's like, we have a tape of it."
02:16:53;02:16:54;"And I feel like I had tapes like that too."
02:16:54;02:16:55;"Yeah."
02:16:55;02:17:00;"Anyway, I remember some tape I had, had, um, prominently featured his song, the heart of"
02:17:00;02:17:01;"rock and roll."
02:17:01;02:17:02;"Right."
02:17:02;02:17:04;"And he was like, I'm going to rock and roll."
02:17:04;02:17:05;"One of the big hits off sports."
02:17:05;02:17:08;"And then I guess everybody knows I want a new drug."
02:17:08;02:17:09;"Yup."
02:17:09;02:17:11;"Weird Al Yankovic parodied that song."
02:17:11;02:17:12;"What was his version?"
02:17:12;02:17:13;"I want a new duck."
02:17:13;02:17:15;"It was just like about getting a new duck."
02:17:15;02:17:17;"I want a new duck."
02:17:17;02:17:18;"That's exactly."
02:17:18;02:17:19;"Yeah."
02:17:19;02:17:20;"Weird Al rules."
02:17:20;02:17:21;"That was one where he was just like, you know what?"
02:17:21;02:17:24;"Let this be one of my more random ones."
02:17:24;02:17:25;"That's tight."
02:17:25;02:17:26;"All right."
02:17:26;02:17:27;"Well, I guess that wraps it up."
02:17:27;02:17:31;"Thank you so much to Huey Lewis legend for coming through a real kind of low energy."
02:17:31;02:17:35;"You know, it is, we just couldn't, it's because we couldn't stick the landing to this Travis"
02:17:35;02:17:37;"Scott time travel thing."
02:17:37;02:17:39;"I mean, there's so many ways to go."
02:17:39;02:17:40;"All right."
02:17:40;02:17:41;"We'll keep working on this."
02:17:41;02:17:42;"We'll workshop it."
02:17:42;02:17:43;"We'll pitch it to Travis."
02:17:43;02:17:44;"He'll love it."
02:17:44;02:17:46;"85 probably is too far back."
02:17:46;02:17:47;"All right."
02:17:47;02:17:48;"We'll figure it out."
02:17:48;02:17:50;"Anyway, thanks for listening."
02:17:50;02:17:52;"We'll see in two weeks."
02:17:52;02:17:53;"Take care of one another."
02:17:53;02:17:54;"Time crisis with Ed's Rock Canyon."
02:17:54;02:17:55;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep."
02:17:55;02:17:56;"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
02:17:56;02:18:01;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep."
