00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:05;00:12;"Today, we complete our epic journey into Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3."
00:12;00:17;"But don't worry, if you're not a Bob-head, there's so much more."
00:17;00:23;"We'll also be talking about Chad Michael Murray, All For One,"
00:23;00:27;"Lisa Loeb, and Brownsville Girl on"
00:27;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:27;"And this is part 2 of our BDGHV 3 special."
01:27;01:31;"That's Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3."
01:31;01:35;"I imagine after the last episode, the word has spread far and wide"
01:35;01:40;"that for all the people dealing with the anxiety and the psychic pain"
01:40;01:45;"of not feeling like they had a way, a path forward in their life"
01:45;01:51;"an open door, an open window into the late career work of Bob Dylan"
01:51;01:57;"we're here to tell you that Bob has a remedy for that, and that's his Greatest Hits Volume 3."
01:57;02:01;"We handpicked these songs in 1994 to give you a taste of it."
02:01;02:03;"Really, this is mid-period."
02:03;02:08;"It's really mid-period. And I think it's important to find a way into the Bob Dylan mid-period"
02:08;02:12;"because the late period is so much more celebrated."
02:12;02:17;"You know, Time Out of Mind won a Grammy, went platinum and all this stuff"
02:17;02:23;"and then Murder Most Foul, it was talked about everywhere from Time Crisis to NPR."
02:23;02:27;"And it did very well on the digital rock sales chart."
02:27;02:32;"It did better than a lot of rock songs on the digital rock sales chart."
02:32;02:34;"He wasn't even trying."
02:34;02:38;"So anyway, that's all to say that Bob had his late period renaissance where"
02:38;02:44;"and I think this happens a lot, even forget about the actual work, you just look at an artist's age"
02:44;02:48;"and you're kind of like, alright, whenever they started"
02:48;02:52;"they started in their teens, their early 20s, even their late 20s"
02:52;02:56;"the 20s maybe could get diced into the 30s"
02:56;03:02;"but certainly the 20s plus or minus a few years is often an artist's classic period."
03:02;03:09;"Even if you think they started doing better work later, it's always going to be hard to beat culturally, vibe-wise"
03:09;03:12;"the early stuff, understandably."
03:12;03:16;"And then at some point, there's going to be the middle period"
03:16;03:21;"where a lot of people do it well, some people might even record their best material"
03:21;03:23;"but it's still the middle period."
03:23;03:27;"The middle of anything is often underappreciated."
03:27;03:31;"And then the artist will come around the corner and at some point they'll become"
03:31;03:35;"the kind of like, elder statesman, the OG, the icon."
03:35;03:39;"I think there might be something about it inherent just to like a human life"
03:39;03:46;"where a lot of people don't really know what to do with themselves between, I don't know, 35 and 60."
03:46;03:50;"I mean, that's the classic era of the midlife crisis, right?"
03:50;03:54;"People who are young and then there's something else after."
03:54;03:57;"And they're like, ""I'm not young anymore and I'm kind of confused. Where's my life going?"
03:57;04:00;"Did I miss my last opportunity? Do I have to change something?"""
04:00;04:04;"And then I feel like eventually you're 60, 65, 70."
04:04;04:07;"You got to chill out a little bit because you're old."
04:07;04:08;"Hopefully."
04:08;04:12;"Hopefully. Maybe you got grandkids. Maybe your hair is gray."
04:12;04:13;"You know what I mean?"
04:13;04:17;"Just some of those questions about like, ""Who am I and what am I doing?"""
04:17;04:20;"Have been answered for you by Father Time."
04:20;04:21;"Even when you look at like some people..."
04:21;04:22;"Father Time."
04:23;04:26;"Father Time had another idea."
04:26;04:27;"You're stuck in the middle."
04:27;04:30;"You're stuck in the middle. Don't know what to do."
04:30;04:32;"Father Time's got plans for you."
04:32;04:38;"What you're really looking for is dignity."
04:38;04:43;"So on this episode, we're going to go back and listen to everything we already did on the last episode."
04:43;04:44;"Starting with dignity."
04:44;04:48;"Now I think middle-aged people have a better sense of how to dress."
04:48;04:51;"Partially because middle age as a category has almost been obliterated."
04:51;04:58;"People stay in this like vaguely post-college vibe for their whole lives."
04:58;05:02;"But I think back in the day, people, you know, somebody would be like 45."
05:02;05:04;"They wouldn't know how to dress anymore."
05:04;05:07;"Because they feel too young just to be an old man."
05:07;05:10;"And they'd feel too old to be trendy."
05:10;05:11;"What do you do with yourself?"
05:11;05:13;"I've never known how to dress."
05:13;05:16;"When I was 25, I certainly didn't know how to dress."
05:16;05:18;"Now I'm 45."
05:18;05:19;"Still don't know."
05:19;05:20;"I don't have a clue."
05:20;05:21;"Well, you got your own style."
05:21;05:22;"If you want to call it that."
05:22;05:26;"Well, maybe in some ways because you've always had a laid-back style."
05:26;05:27;"T-shirt and jeans."
05:27;05:28;"New balances."
05:28;05:29;"Running sneakers."
05:29;05:31;"Running sneakers."
05:31;05:32;"Maybe a fleece."
05:32;05:36;"Probably a free shirt I got from a friend's band."
05:36;05:37;"Yep."
05:37;05:39;"Well, you can never go wrong with that."
05:39;05:43;"Anyway, all I'm saying is that the middle of anything can often be awkward."
05:43;05:45;"Especially with the musicians."
05:45;05:50;"A lot of times the middle work is appreciated much more when you hear the late work."
05:50;05:52;"Because suddenly it's a sandwich."
05:52;05:53;"Yep."
05:53;05:59;"I was thinking about that when we were reading the Chris Gauw review."
05:59;06:02;"He probably already thought of Bob as old."
06:02;06:03;"Sure."
06:03;06:05;"And way past his prime in 1978."
06:05;06:06;"Yeah, 1978, street legal."
06:06;06:09;"I was like, I wish he would do a Robert Chris Gauw revisited."
06:09;06:10;"Right."
06:10;06:14;"Yeah, because when you listen to Joker, man, you're listening to these guys who are, how old are they?"
06:14;06:16;"Like late 20s, early 30s, something like that."
06:16;06:17;"Something."
06:17;06:19;"They're Zoomer millennial types."
06:19;06:21;"Yeah, they're taking it all in."
06:21;06:23;"I mean, just like me or any of us."
06:23;06:27;"They're taking all this work in as one big body."
06:27;06:32;"They're not somebody who just listened to, obsessively listened to Blood on the Tracks and Desire."
06:32;06:34;"And then is like, oh, I can't wait to hear Street Legal."
06:34;06:37;"And then you take it home and you're like, saxophone?"
06:37;06:38;"They're not experiencing that."
06:38;06:39;"It's all there."
06:39;06:40;"Yep."
06:40;06:41;"His whole career has been flattened out."
06:41;06:43;"You're not experiencing it in real time."
06:43;06:44;"So you can look at it so differently."
06:44;06:50;"And also, I do think on the last episode, we said three is always been considered."
06:50;06:55;"I'm not totally sure why, but three has been considered to be a magic number and a mystical number."
06:55;06:58;"In numerology and the Holy Trinity."
06:58;07:01;"And then in that Schoolhouse Rock song."
07:01;07:03;"Actually, I want to throw that on for a second."
07:03;07:05;"See, I told you it wasn't going to be all Bob Dylan."
07:05;07:10;"Because I was playing this the other day for my family."
07:10;07:12;"There's a line in it."
07:12;07:18;"A man and a woman had a little baby that makes three in the family."
07:18;07:19;"Okay, so this is the original."
07:19;07:22;"And also, I don't know who's playing on it."
07:22;07:24;"It's like a great drummer."
07:24;07:26;"It's just a great, tasteful '70s recording."
07:32;07:36;"Three is a magic number."
07:36;07:38;"Yes, it is."
07:38;07:39;"You know this, right, Jake?"
07:39;07:40;"No."
07:40;07:42;"Oh, this is like Schoolhouse Rock from the '70s."
07:42;07:43;"Don't know it."
07:43;07:45;"Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity."
07:45;07:47;"You've heard the Blind Melon version, right?"
07:47;07:49;"Oh, yeah. Blind Melon covered in the '90s."
07:49;07:51;"Has a magic number."
07:51;07:53;"The past and the present and the future."
07:53;07:56;"Faith and hope and charity."
07:56;07:58;"The heart and the brain and the body."
07:58;07:59;"A little bit of a Larry Norman vibe."
07:59;08:00;"Oh, yeah, totally."
08:00;08:03;"Has a magic number."
08:03;08:07;"It takes three legs to make a tripod or to make a table stand."
08:07;08:12;"It takes three wheels to make a vehicle called a tricycle."
08:12;08:14;"Every triangle has three corners."
08:14;08:16;"Every triangle has three sides."
08:16;08:18;"No more, no less."
08:18;08:21;"You don't have to guess."
08:21;08:25;"When it's three, you can see it's a magic number."
08:25;08:28;"Reminds me of Mighty Quinn, the Eskimo."
08:28;08:30;"Oh, yeah. Bob."
08:30;08:32;"Yes, they did."
08:32;08:36;"They had three in the family."
08:36;08:40;"Has a magic number."
08:40;08:42;"Mmm, yeah, tasty."
08:42;08:44;"Three, six, nine."
08:44;08:46;"Twelve, fifteen, eighteen."
08:46;08:48;"Twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven."
08:48;08:50;"Thirty."
08:50;08:51;"Bass player going on."
08:51;08:53;"Three, six, nine."
08:53;08:55;"Twelve, fifteen, eighteen."
08:55;08:57;"Twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven."
08:57;08:59;"Thirty."
08:59;09:04;"Now the multiples of three come up three times in each set of ten."
09:04;09:06;"In the first ten, you get three, six, nine."
09:06;09:09;"And in the teens ten, it's twelve, fifteen, and eighteen."
09:09;09:13;"And in the twenties, you get a twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven."
09:13;09:15;"And it comes out even on thirties."
09:15;09:17;"Now multiply backwards from three times ten."
09:17;09:20;"Three times ten is thirty."
09:20;09:22;"Three times nine is twenty-seven."
09:22;09:24;"Three times eight is twenty-four."
09:24;09:26;"This is trippy."
09:26;09:28;"Yeah, it's nice being a kid, taking this down as a kid."
09:28;09:30;"What?"
09:30;09:32;"Three times four is twelve."
09:32;09:34;"And three times three is nine."
09:34;09:36;"And three times two is six."
09:36;09:40;"And three times one is three, of course."
09:40;09:41;"Now take the pattern once more."
09:41;09:43;"Three, six, nine."
09:43;09:45;"Twelve, fifteen, eighteen."
09:45;09:48;"Three, six, mafia got their name."
09:48;09:50;"Thirty."
09:50;09:52;"Now multiply from ten backwards."
09:52;09:56;"How funny it would be if this wasn't made for a children's cartoon."
09:56;10:02;"It's like, this weird dude named Bob Dorough, he dropped this single in the seventies."
10:02;10:04;"Nobody really knows much about him."
10:04;10:09;"He was from Indianapolis, moved out to L.A. in '69."
10:09;10:11;"Two is six."
10:11;10:13;"And three times one."
10:13;10:14;"What is it?"
10:14;10:15;"Three!"
10:15;10:16;"Yeah."
10:16;10:20;"That's a magic number."
10:20;10:24;"A man and a woman had a little baby."
10:24;10:26;"Yes, they did."
10:26;10:31;"They had three in the family."
10:31;10:36;"That's a magic number."
10:36;10:44;"Also, clearly this is a kind of hippie, counterculture dude who knows cool, weird, countercultural music."
10:44;10:49;"And I also love the idea that somebody was like, ""Can you do a song about the number three?"""
10:49;10:51;"You know, just to teach the kid."
10:51;10:55;"Because I guess this is from a special specifically called ""Multiplication Rock."""
10:55;10:59;"So they probably assigned this guy a bunch of the numbers."
10:59;11:01;"And they were like, ""Oh yeah, do a song for three."
11:01;11:04;"And make sure you have some part that especially gets into the times tables."""
11:04;11:07;"Because that's like, especially in the '70s, that's what kids gotta know."
11:07;11:10;"They gotta go, ""Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen."""
11:10;11:12;"Help them remember that."
11:12;11:14;"And he's probably like, ""Yeah, yeah, okay. What's my weigh in?"""
11:14;11:16;"And he's like, ""Oh, let me see. Three is a magic number."""
11:16;11:19;"You know, just like a cute way to talk about the number three."
11:19;11:24;"But then you listen to some of the other parts, and it almost is on some weird hippie numerology sh*t."
11:24;11:26;"It's not just like, ""Three is a fun number."""
11:26;11:30;"I think he really believes three is a magic number."
11:30;11:32;"Because he's talking about the mystery of life."
11:32;11:38;"""A man and a woman had a little baby. That makes three in the family."""
11:38;11:41;"He does have like a real haunting voice, in a way."
11:41;11:43;"I mean, the whole thing. What did he say in the beginning?"
11:43;11:45;"""Faith and hope and charity."""
11:45;11:53;"And actually, I don't know this stuff well, but when you get into a lot of weird mysticism, like Kabbalah,"
11:53;11:56;"a lot of it is kind of about math and numbers."
11:56;12:01;"""Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity."""
12:01;12:03;"""In the ancient mystic trinity."""
12:03;12:08;"Mom! What's the ancient mystic trinity?"
12:08;12:11;"What are you watching?"
12:11;12:16;"There is something about three. I don't really understand this stuff,"
12:16;12:21;"but I can understand from some weird, esoteric, philosophical point of view."
12:21;12:25;"Three does represent something very interesting, because you have one."
12:25;12:28;"The one indivisible. Then it breaks into two."
12:28;12:31;"Now you have contrast for the first time ever."
12:31;12:33;"One versus two. Two different things."
12:33;12:38;"And then you have three, which is like, breaks the binary."
12:38;12:41;"It is an important number, even just for how we think about stuff."
12:41;12:42;"I mean, three dimensions."
12:42;12:45;"Three dimensions, right? We live in a three-dimensional world."
12:45;12:46;"Three is a magic number."
13:14;13:17;"So anyway, three is a very magic number."
13:17;13:22;"And you look at stories and lives and narratives as being beginning, middle, and end."
13:22;13:26;"You see the way that three contextualizes everything."
13:26;13:28;"And anyway, you think about making a sandwich."
13:28;13:30;"You could picture somebody, you watch somebody make a sandwich,"
13:30;13:32;"they've got a really nice piece of bread."
13:32;13:37;"Mmm, that looks like a really well-made, toasted piece of French bread."
13:37;13:39;"They start putting some turkey on it."
13:39;13:40;"Where are you going with this?"
13:40;13:42;"Then you put another piece. Oh, it's a sandwich."
13:42;13:44;"It's a closed sandwich."
13:44;13:45;"[Laughter]"
13:45;13:47;"I see a unity."
13:47;13:50;"Anyway, yeah, so this is Bob's middle career."
13:50;13:53;"And I think it's important to kind of recontextualize it."
13:53;13:55;"So this is his volume, Greatest Hits Volume 3."
13:55;13:57;"I wonder if he'll do a Volume 4."
13:57;13:58;"He should."
13:58;13:59;"Yeah."
13:59;14:02;"1991 to 2022."
14:02;14:06;"He probably has a lot of unreleased material for his Greatest Hits."
14:06;14:09;"Yeah, I mean, Immortal Most Foul had been unreleased."
14:09;14:11;"It had been sitting on the shelf for like 10 years."
14:11;14:12;"He'll drop something like that."
14:12;14:15;"Yeah, I could picture Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 4,"
14:15;14:17;"Track 1, Early Roman Kings."
14:17;14:21;"Track 2, a song nobody-- an unreleased song."
14:21;14:24;"Track 3, maybe that song from Wonder Boys."
14:24;14:26;"Like, arguably, like, kind of, things have changed."
14:26;14:28;"Like, oh, kind of it."
14:28;14:32;"All right, but let's get back into Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3."
14:32;14:34;"Last time we left off with Ring Them Bells,"
14:34;14:35;"which we didn't catch this at the time,"
14:35;14:38;"but I do have to point out that he says ""sweet Martha."""
14:38;14:39;"That's deep."
14:40;14:44;"So the next song on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3."
14:44;14:48;"Now, this one legitimately would belong on a traditional Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits"
14:48;14:51;"because this was like, I think, somewhat of a hit single."
14:51;14:52;"""Gotta Serve Somebody."""
14:52;14:57;"This is off his first Christian album, Slow Train Comin'."
14:57;15:01;"Although, the more I engage with Bob's work, the middle and the late period,"
15:01;15:07;"it's funnier and funnier for me to think of his fans or critics or peers"
15:07;15:11;"being, like, scandalized by him, quote-unquote, ""going Christian"""
15:11;15:15;"just because Bob Dylan's music, from the jump,"
15:15;15:22;"is so indebted to religious music, spirituals, gospel."
15:22;15:25;"So many of his lyrics deal with, you know--"
15:25;15:26;"The Bible."
15:26;15:31;"The Bible and these, like, major archetypes that come from religion and stuff."
15:31;15:33;"It's not like the Rolling Stones went Christian."
15:33;15:37;"He already had songs that kind of you could interpret through a Christian lens."
15:37;15:40;"And the idea that at some point he might commit himself a little more"
15:40;15:45;"to that particular strain of traditional--"
15:45;15:47;"It's just not that surprising."
15:47;15:48;"And then, you know, you hear--"
15:48;15:50;"So if this was, like, the first song you heard from his Christian period,"
15:50;15:52;"""Gotta Serve Somebody,"""
15:52;15:56;"if anything, I'd be more, like, shocked by the music or something."
15:56;15:58;"Yeah, more like kind of this--"
15:58;16:00;"kind of steely Dan, light funk."
16:00;16:01;"Just like, ""Huh."""
16:01;16:06;"♪ You may be an ambassador to England or France ♪"
16:06;16:08;"♪ You may like to give a-- ♪"
16:08;16:12;"Yeah, this was peaked at number 24--"
16:12;16:13;"That's a hit."
16:13;16:15;"--on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart."
16:15;16:17;"And this is '79, so correct me if I'm wrong,"

20:52;20:56;"he's applying the exact same lens to Christianity."

21:14;21:16;"But, you know, you're thinking, like, the Bob worldview,"

21:18;21:24;"It's just like, well, every action creates a series of events."
21:24;21:28;"One way or another, you exist in this weird world."
21:28;21:30;"He's not saying who you're serving."
21:30;21:33;"He's not saying, ""This is the Lord's way."""
21:33;21:34;"Right."
21:34;21:37;"""This is the true way, and this is what Christianity means."""

21:48;21:51;"that one way or another, your actions will spill out,"
21:51;21:55;"which in a weird way is way more like Eastern or something."
21:55;21:58;"Well, yeah, I mean, as someone that is not a Christian,"
21:58;22:04;"I still find a lot of insight, and it also has a very humorous, light touch, too,"
22:04;22:06;"which I appreciate."
22:06;22:11;"There is some real insight, and it really gives you something to chew on."
22:11;22:12;"Yeah, totally."
22:12;22:15;"Because, yeah, however you want to say it,"
22:15;22:20;"the bill's going to come due, karmic justice,"
22:20;22:23;"whatever lens you want to look at it through."
22:23;22:26;"And whether it's just even just like there is no God or devil,"
22:26;22:30;"but you still have to serve the people around you, your friends, your family."
22:30;22:31;"Right."
22:31;22:32;"There's always something."
22:32;22:37;"Yeah, and that while you're here, everything you do has a ripple effect."
22:37;22:40;"And even if you think you can move to another country or something"
22:40;22:44;"and get away from that rat race of businessmen and guys own banks"
22:44;22:48;"and things like that, you're still in this world, you know?"
22:48;22:49;"Yeah."
22:49;22:50;"You're still here in the physical world."
22:50;22:54;"Apparently, John Lennon was very offended by that song,"
22:54;22:59;"John Lennon having quite a different relationship to religion than Bob Dylan,"
22:59;23:01;"you know, when you think about ""Imagine."""
23:01;23:05;"Maybe he's the rock and roller prancing on the stage that he took offense to."
23:05;23:06;"Maybe."
23:06;23:09;"God is a concept by which we--"
23:09;23:10;"What is the lyric?"

23:11;23:12;"Right."
23:12;23:13;"I never fully understood the song ""God."""
23:13;23:14;"It is a good song."
23:14;23:16;"It went on famously in ""Imagine."""
23:16;23:19;"Imagine no religion."
23:19;23:24;"But I guess John was very offended by ""Serve Somebody."""
23:24;23:26;"I think the late '70s, I've always been under the impression,"
23:26;23:29;"were kind of a dark period for Lennon"
23:29;23:34;"before kind of feeling reinvigorated and recording ""Double Fantasy,"""
23:34;23:36;"just kind of like laying low."
23:36;23:38;"There used to be these tapes on YouTube,"
23:38;23:41;"these like home tapes he made of him just talking to himself"
23:41;23:43;"and just like seeming like in a really dark place"
23:43;23:48;"and feeling kind of competitive and out of the loop and weird."
23:48;23:50;"Anyway, I guess he made a song."
23:50;23:53;"I guess it's only a home recording called ""Serve Yourself,"""
23:53;23:55;"which was like his rebuttal."
23:55;23:57;"I've never heard this."
24:02;24:04;"Came out on a box set."
24:04;24:13;"I'm sorry to tell you."
24:13;24:17;"You say you found Jesus."
24:17;24:22;"He's the only one."

24:50;24:53;"too much cockadoodledoo."
24:53;24:57;"You know there's something missing in this God Almighty's tomb."
24:57;25:01;"You gotta reach your mother."
25:01;25:04;"Don't forget your mother, Bob."
25:04;25:08;"You got to serve yourself."
25:08;25:13;"Ain't nobody gonna do it for you."
25:13;25:17;"You got to serve yourself."
25:17;25:22;"Ain't nobody gonna do it for you."
25:22;25:25;"Well, you may believe in devils."
25:25;25:27;"You may believe in laws."
25:27;25:30;"But you know you're gonna have to serve yourself."
25:30;25:34;"Wow, it's a direct rebuttal."
25:34;25:37;"I'll take ""serve yourself"" over this any day."
25:37;25:38;"You're gonna serve somebody?"
25:38;25:39;"Yeah, I'll serve somebody over this any day."
25:39;25:41;"Well, I guess to be fair to John Lennon,"
25:41;25:42;"I almost feel bad."
25:42;25:44;"Maybe he never meant for anybody to hear this."
25:44;25:46;"This just clearly sounds like him on a tape recorder."
25:46;25:51;"Yeah, yeah."
25:51;25:54;"I wonder if we'll ever get the equivalent of a streaming box set"
25:54;25:57;"from some artist who died young and it's just like,"
25:57;26:01;"and here's 2,000 voice memos from their phone."
26:01;26:02;"The family."
26:02;26:03;"Oh my God."
26:03;26:05;"And you just listen to it and one's like just 10 seconds,"
26:05;26:08;"just like, ""And, and, and, and, and, and."""
26:08;26:10;"Unfortunately, I feel we're already pretty close to that."
26:10;26:11;"Yeah."
26:11;26:13;"It's like you could see like Juice WRLD's family"
26:13;26:15;"just being like, ""Here you go."""
26:15;26:18;"Under no circumstances may my voice memos"
26:18;26:22;"be released in a compilation."
26:22;26:26;"Too much monkey business around here, honey."
26:26;26:28;"All right, he's just horsing around."
26:28;26:31;"John Lennon, also a world-class songwriter."
26:31;26:33;"Clearly he didn't think enough of that song"
26:33;26:36;"to like put it on Double Fantasy."
26:36;26:38;"We can't really judge."
26:38;26:39;"Yeah, I mean, also John Lennon,"
26:39;26:42;"there's like a strain of some songs that he did in the '70s"
26:42;26:45;"when he kind of would get into his kind of,"
26:45;26:47;"like get a little too topical."
26:47;26:49;"When he was trying to do his like angry political songs,"
26:49;26:51;"just like never, his best ones I always thought"
26:51;26:53;"were like either really personal"
26:53;26:56;"or kind of like vibey psychedelic."
26:56;26:58;"Or even in the case of ""Imagine,"""
26:58;27:00;"kind of just poetic and stuff."
27:00;27:03;"You know, like it's cool that ""Imagine"" is just like,"
27:03;27:04;"just imagine this, imagine that,"
27:04;27:06;"that it's just not like, you know,"
27:06;27:08;"obviously it would be so dated if it was just like,"
27:08;27:11;"♪ Imagine no Richard Nixon ♪"
27:11;27:14;"Like, ♪ No Vietnam ♪"
27:14;27:15;"Yeah, right."
27:15;27:16;"God, who knows?"
27:16;27:18;"There could have been an early version of that."
27:18;27:19;"And there's something about this too"
27:19;27:20;"where I'm just kind of like, who knows?"
27:20;27:21;"I picture late '70s,"
27:21;27:23;"John just like kind of feeling out of it,"
27:23;27:24;"out of the loop and weird."
27:24;27:28;"And one of his heroes/peers, Bob Dylan,"
27:28;27:31;"dropping this and he just kind of almost like,"
27:31;27:32;"maybe just had a knee jerk reaction like,"
27:32;27:33;"""Oh, oh what?"""
27:33;27:34;"So-"
27:34;27:36;"Just kind of eye rolling the-"
27:36;27:37;"Yeah."
27:37;27:40;"I mean, I wonder how foregrounded"
27:40;27:41;"in the media narrative"
27:41;27:44;"and like the album cycle press in 1978,"
27:44;27:46;"the Christianity thing was."
27:46;27:47;"I think it was pretty-"
27:47;27:48;"I think it was pretty foregrounded"
27:48;27:50;"'cause even before the album came out,"
27:50;27:52;"there were like little clips"
27:52;27:54;"about him using certain language."
27:54;27:57;"Like he was in a, there was a deposition."
27:57;27:59;"He was deposed because he was being sued"
27:59;28:02;"by Patty Valentine from the hurricane."
28:02;28:04;"'Cause he talks about Patty Valentine throughout,"
28:04;28:06;"who's a real woman who was a witness"
28:06;28:11;"in the murder that the hurricane was falsely accused of."
28:11;28:13;"And so anyway, Patty Valentine,"
28:13;28:14;"here's her name in a Bob Dylan song"
28:14;28:15;"and then she's suing him."
28:15;28:17;"I don't know if she really had grounds or whatever,"
28:17;28:21;"but apparently there was a line in the deposition"
28:21;28:23;"where the, as I understand it,"
28:23;28:25;"are often like very hostile moments"
28:25;28:27;"where you got somebody's lawyer"
28:27;28:28;"just trying to poke hole."
28:28;28:30;"And somebody said something to you like,"
28:30;28:31;"that Patty Valentine's lawyer"
28:31;28:33;"was trying to like rile Bob up"
28:33;28:35;"and said something like,"
28:35;28:38;"""So you must be a very wealthy man, Mr. Dylan."""
28:38;28:40;"And almost like Bob Marley style, he said,"
28:40;28:42;"""You mean my treasure on the earth?"
28:42;28:43;"""Well."""
28:43;28:44;"And there's something like that."
28:44;28:45;"Amazing."
28:45;28:46;"And so I feel like I was reading something"
28:46;28:49;"that said somehow that aspect of the deposition"
28:49;28:50;"was like reported"
28:50;28:52;"and already maybe people had seen him at church or something."
28:52;28:53;"So there's this thing,"
28:53;28:55;"they hear Bob Dylan talking about money,"
28:55;28:57;"referring to it as his treasure on the earth."
28:57;28:59;"And I think there was a buzz where people were like,"
28:59;29:00;"""Is Dylan a Christian now?"""
29:00;29:01;"And then he dropped ""Slow Chain Coming."""
29:01;29:04;"Also, this is happening post his divorce."
29:04;29:05;"I think there's a lot."
29:05;29:07;"I can't remember at the time,"
29:07;29:12;"I certainly know now people being dubious of his intentions"
29:12;29:14;"because he's also investing in a church."
29:14;29:15;"Is he trying?"
29:15;29:18;"You know, the same way Kanye doing his Sunday service,"
29:18;29:20;"people were going, ""What's your intention here?"
29:20;29:22;"""Are there tax write-offs?"""
29:22;29:25;"As always, Bob and Kanye, so much resonance."
29:25;29:26;"Yeah, parallel tracks."
29:26;29:27;"Parallel tracks."
29:27;29:29;"Yeah, yeah, so I could see some people-"
29:29;29:30;"Is he divesting his money"
29:30;29:33;"or is he trying to protect some of his assets"
29:33;29:35;"because he's being sued by his ex?"
29:35;29:36;"Oh, that's interesting."
29:36;29:38;"Famously, you know,"
29:38;29:42;"I'd turned his back on like the pious folk music scene."
29:42;29:44;"So I could see people who were like"
29:44;29:46;"already kind of felt burned by him in the mid '60s."
29:46;29:49;"Like the real folkies, the real folk heads"
29:49;29:52;"have been like, basically, after he plugged in,"
29:52;29:56;"they saw Bob's like earnest anti-war folk stuff"
29:56;29:59;"as like somehow insincere."
29:59;30:00;"And I think he did do,"
30:00;30:02;"I don't know if he overtly said it,"
30:02;30:07;"but I think lines and songs and probably press he did."
30:07;30:10;"I think people are also aware that he, in some ways,"
30:10;30:13;"was not only changing stylistically when he went electric,"
30:13;30:15;"but also saying, in a way,"
30:15;30:18;"it makes us think about a lot of weird conversations"
30:18;30:21;"that anger and tension that's floating around at this moment."
30:21;30:24;"I think people did feel like he was also saying,"
30:24;30:25;"""And you know what?"
30:25;30:28;"""This kind of like finger-pointing progressive politics,"
30:28;30:29;"""I'm done with it."""
30:29;30:31;"'Cause I did read, there was an article,"
30:31;30:35;"there's a New Yorker profile from like '64 of Dylan,"
30:35;30:37;"and they spent some time with him in the studio."
30:37;30:38;"And at that point, he specifically,"
30:38;30:40;"so this is after ""Blown in the Wind"""
30:40;30:41;"and ""The Hard Rain Ain't Gonna Fall,"""
30:41;30:43;"and he specifically says,"
30:43;30:45;"""I'm getting away from that finger-pointing (beep)."""
30:45;30:47;"And you can, on the one hand, that's an artistic choice,"
30:47;30:48;"but you can also imagine,"
30:48;30:51;"at a very tense political moment in the '60s,"
30:51;30:54;"to have this guy that people pin their hopes and dreams on,"
30:54;30:56;"saying, ""Enough with the finger-pointing."""
30:56;30:57;"There might've been people who were like,"
30:57;30:58;"""What do you mean, Bob?"
30:58;30:59;"""We need more finger-pointing."""
30:59;31:00;"And also, if you're saying"
31:00;31:02;"you're done with finger-pointing your music,"
31:02;31:03;"what are you saying?"
31:03;31:05;"Are you saying that we're just like angry progressives?"
31:05;31:06;"- Well, he's gonna say,"
31:06;31:09;"""I'm gonna serve myself, and I'm an artist."
31:09;31:12;"""And I'm gonna do what I wanna do, and go to hell."""
31:12;31:14;"So I can see those people,"
31:14;31:17;"so then he's like smash cut 12 years later,"
31:17;31:18;"he's a Christian."
31:18;31:20;"- And that's like the final indignity for those people."
31:20;31:22;"- And people are just like, ""What are you doing, dude?"""
31:22;31:25;"- Right, 'cause that, yeah, maybe in their worldview,"
31:25;31:29;"if they're kind of a new age people,"
31:29;31:31;"yeah, Christianity would strike them"
31:31;31:32;"as regressive or something."
31:32;31:33;"- Yeah?"
31:33;31:34;"- And inherently conservative."
31:34;31:35;"And I do have to say that, Bob,"
31:35;31:38;"the John Lennon song, you can tell that,"
31:38;31:40;"well, clearly they weren't having a direct conversation"
31:40;31:42;"or something, but you actually, like you said,"
31:42;31:44;"you dig in to serve somebody,"
31:44;31:46;"it's kind of weird, esoteric,"
31:46;31:47;"you could interpret it a lot of different ways."
31:47;31:49;"And then the John Lennon song opens with,"
31:49;31:53;"""You say you love Jesus, and he's the only one."""
31:53;31:56;"And you could imagine Bob being like, ""I didn't say that."""
31:56;31:58;"- In fact, I wanna point out,"
31:58;32:01;"while there's so much specifically Christian imagery"
32:01;32:03;"in the album, that song specifically"
32:03;32:05;"is just, you gotta serve somebody."
32:05;32:07;"It's actually just a really,"
32:07;32:09;"like there's, no matter who you are,"
32:09;32:12;"if you're rich or poor, if you're famous or not famous,"
32:12;32:14;"you're gonna have to serve somebody."
32:14;32:16;"It could be any God."
32:16;32:17;"Like that, of all the songs,"
32:17;32:20;"that specifically feels just the most,"
32:20;32:23;"just sort of a larger spiritual, religious,"
32:23;32:24;"you know, higher power understanding."
32:24;32:26;"- Yeah, and actually when you think about it,"
32:26;32:29;"he doesn't say, ""You're either serving God"
32:29;32:30;"""or you're serving the devil,"""
32:30;32:32;"which would sound, I could imagine to some of you,"
32:32;32:33;"it would sound like you're either with us or against us."
32:33;32:35;"What he's saying is way closer maybe"
32:35;32:38;"to an early solo Lennon type thing,"
32:38;32:41;"where he's saying, ""Might be God, might be devil,"
32:41;32:44;"""who knows what it might be, but no matter what, there's--"""
32:44;32:45;"- This is bigger than us."
32:45;32:47;"- And I guess actually when you think about"
32:47;32:49;"the end of God, the Lennon song,"
32:49;32:51;"when he's going, which is pretty wild actually."
32:51;32:54;"- I don't believe in Zimmerman."
32:54;32:56;"- And he says, ""I don't believe in Zimmerman."""
32:59;33:01;"Great sounding record, but at the end."

33:07;33:10;"♪ I don't believe in Gita ♪"
33:13;33:17;"♪ I don't believe in yoga ♪"

33:37;33:41;"♪ I don't believe in Beatles ♪"
33:41;33:43;"- I love how serious he is."
33:43;33:44;"- When he drops the Beatles."
33:44;33:48;"- It's like, ""In me, yoga with me."""
33:49;33:50;"Beautiful song though."
33:50;33:51;"- Beautiful song, yeah."
33:51;33:52;"And two different schools of thought"
33:52;33:55;"because you can tell John's like,"
33:55;33:59;"in a way, John is like a more passionate, angry dude."
33:59;34:01;"- Yeah, he's more serious in a way."
34:01;34:02;"Even though Bob's the one that's like,"
34:02;34:03;"making a Christian record."
34:03;34:04;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, totally."
34:04;34:05;"- Bob has a lighter touch."
34:05;34:07;"- Bob has a much lighter touch."
34:07;34:09;"And I guess it's not hard to understand"
34:09;34:12;"that like, Bob always, he's a solo artist."
34:12;34:14;"He always got to be his,"
34:14;34:15;"he always got to be the joker man."
34:15;34:18;"From the jump, he got to have that mix of humor,"
34:18;34:21;"seriousness, old, new, whatever."
34:21;34:25;"Whereas John was in maybe the greatest of all time,"
34:25;34:27;"but still in some ways, a boy band."
34:27;34:30;"And he maybe, he had to like,"
34:30;34:32;"fell he had to swing between extremes, you know?"
34:32;34:34;"Whereas like, Bob always kind of"
34:34;34:36;"had the balance dialed in himself."
34:36;34:39;"Yeah, it's interesting to think about this like weird,"
34:39;34:41;"I wonder if Bob Dylan and John Lennon"
34:41;34:42;"interacted much in the seventies."
34:42;34:43;"But like probably Bob--"
34:43;34:44;"- I gotta think they did."
34:44;34:46;"- I can imagine Bob Dylan hearing the song ""God"""
34:46;34:48;"and being, and kind of rolling his eyes."
34:48;34:49;"- Totally."
34:49;34:50;"- Because it is so serious."
34:50;34:52;"♪ I don't believe in believe ♪"
34:52;34:54;"And actually, maybe John took it personally."
34:54;34:55;"So nine years later,"
34:55;34:57;"here's this song,"
34:57;34:59;"'cause you can imagine Bob Dylan hearing this song"
34:59;35:00;"and just thinking like,"
35:00;35:02;"you're like a naive little boy, man."
35:02;35:04;"Oh, well, you don't believe in any of those things?"
35:04;35:06;"Oh, well, you throw them away?"
35:06;35:07;"That means they disappear."
35:07;35:10;"All you believe in is you and Yoko?"
35:10;35:12;"You're still gonna have to serve somebody."
35:12;35:14;"- Good luck with that."
35:14;35:17;"- It may be Yoko or it may be Lord,"
35:17;35:19;"but you're gonna have to serve somebody."
35:19;35:23;"- Bob is the older, wiser, big brother joker man."
35:23;35:25;"And maybe John just like, didn't want to admit it,"
35:25;35:28;"but 'cause also it's so '70s too."
35:28;35:29;"This is some real like Adam Curtis"
35:29;35:31;"century of the self type thing."
35:31;35:33;"But to imagine a guy who made it through the '60s,"
35:33;35:34;"you're John."
35:34;35:37;"Understandably, you've been burned in your life"
35:37;35:39;"by so many belief systems."
35:39;35:43;"He's probably watched friends take acid"
35:43;35:45;"and get obsessed with some specific religion."
35:45;35:47;"Him saying, I don't believe in Gita."
35:47;35:49;"Seems, you know, he just--"
35:49;35:50;"- Krishna."
35:50;35:52;"- Yeah, he tried out aspects of Hinduism."
35:52;35:54;"He's probably also throwing a little bit of shade"
35:54;35:55;"at George there."
35:55;35:56;"- Yeah."
35:56;35:58;"- I don't believe in Gita like him."
35:58;36:01;"You know, and he probably growing up in England,"
36:01;36:03;"maybe he felt burned by Christianity"
36:03;36:06;"and clearly he's burned by being a member of the Beatles."
36:06;36:08;"So you can imagine he has so much anguish and anger"
36:08;36:11;"and he wants to kind of get off his chest."
36:11;36:14;"But then what he's suggesting as an alternative,"
36:14;36:18;"which is very like burned out hippie going into the '70s,"
36:18;36:20;"like enough of that (beep)"
36:20;36:23;"all I believe in is me and my girlfriend."
36:23;36:27;"In his mind, he's like, he's made this big epic change,"
36:27;36:30;"throwing away all these old belief systems."
36:30;36:32;"All I believe in is me and my girlfriend."
36:32;36:34;"This is how we're gonna live and this is gonna work."
36:34;36:36;"And then Bob, the older, wiser one being like,"
36:36;36:38;"I'm still gonna serve somebody, man."
36:38;36:41;"You and your girlfriend, that's a belief system."
36:41;36:42;"That's an ideology too."
36:42;36:45;"This is some real, this is an illusion thing."
36:45;36:49;"By throwing away the Beatles and all world religions,"
36:49;36:51;"John felt he had finally established"
36:51;36:53;"a type of utopian way of thinking"
36:53;36:56;"based in an individualistic humanism"
36:56;37:00;"centered around himself and his girlfriend, Yoko Ono."
37:00;37:03;"As he believed that this would be the path forward"
37:03;37:05;"that would bring him peace."
37:05;37:07;"But this was an illusion."
37:07;37:09;"He still had to serve somebody."
37:09;37:13;"- And then they just go into the intro chords of ""Kid A""."
37:13;37:15;"(both laughing)"
37:15;37:16;"- Start playing."
37:16;37:19;"(both laughing)"
37:19;37:21;"- So wait, what year was the Lennon demo tape"
37:21;37:24;"that we listened to about ""Serve Yourself""?"
37:24;37:26;"- I bet it was '79. - I bet it was '79."
37:26;37:27;"- '79, yeah."
37:27;37:31;"- Lennon's worldview didn't shift at all throughout the '70s."
37:31;37:37;"He's still basically rewriting God, which was from 1970."
37:37;37:39;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, from '70."
37:39;37:42;"- So he's just kind of, he's kind of stuck in his--"
37:42;37:43;"- If he had lived longer,"
37:43;37:46;"if he hadn't been horrifically killed,"
37:46;37:49;"it would be interesting to see where he would have ended up"
37:49;37:51;"in his 40s and his 50s and stuff,"
37:51;37:54;"because he is, I could totally picture"
37:54;37:57;"like a later in life Lennon coming around"
37:57;38:00;"to a type of Christianity or spirituality."
38:00;38:02;"He just, because he wasn't like,"
38:02;38:05;"he wasn't as prolific as Lennon in the '70s."
38:05;38:06;"So yeah, you're right."
38:06;38:08;"He was still kind of in his '70s mode,"
38:08;38:10;"which is a little bit bitter about the '60s, whatever."
38:10;38:11;"With ""Double Fantasy"","
38:11;38:13;"you're starting to hear this dude embracing--"
38:13;38:15;"- Feel like starting over. - A new phase of life."
38:15;38:18;"Who's to say what type of song he might have been writing"
38:18;38:22;"about God or religion if he was making something in '94?"
38:22;38:24;"Who knows? It might've been different."
38:24;38:25;"But yeah, you're right."
38:25;38:28;"At that moment from '70 to '79, kind of like one worldview."
38:28;38:30;"I may have said this on the show back in the day,"
38:30;38:32;"but I'd be remiss not to say it again."
38:32;38:34;"""Serve Somebody"" has always struck me"
38:34;38:37;"as the inspiration for this song."
38:37;38:40;"[upbeat music]"
38:40;38:42;"- Oh, yeah. Good call."
38:42;38:44;"- And there is something funny too about, like,"
38:44;38:47;"if you were nervous that, like, Bob Dylan"
38:47;38:48;"was gonna be a Jesus freak,"
38:48;38:50;"and then he kind of comes out with, like,"
38:50;38:51;"""We gotta have to serve somebody."""
38:51;38:54;"It's very, like, cool and, like,"
38:54;38:55;"cosmopolitan and funky."
38:55;38:58;"And weirdly, it makes me think-- this song's about, like, crime."

43:13;43:15;"'cause with the hardcore Dylan fans,"
43:15;43:18;"there's a lot of discussion about"
43:18;43:21;"a handful of songs that they consider to be late--"
43:21;43:23;"or we should say middle-period masterpieces--"
43:23;43:26;"that he left off albums,"
43:26;43:29;"one of which is ""Blind Willie McTell,"""
43:29;43:31;"which could have been on Infidels,"
43:31;43:34;"in which the band covered, and then he started busting out."
43:34;43:36;"So, you know, a song that a lot of people are like,"
43:36;43:38;"""Oh, if he had dropped that on Infidels,"
43:38;43:40;"that would have been an all-time record."""
43:40;43:42;"And this is another one of them."
43:42;43:44;"This was also recorded with Daniel Lanois for ""Oh, Mercy."""
43:44;43:46;"And it's pretty wild, because it's--"
43:46;43:49;"I've never heard a Bob Dylan song quite like this,"
43:49;43:51;"because it's, like, it's very contemporary."
43:51;43:54;"It's a very '89 contemporary-type song."
43:54;43:56;"We were texting about it a couple weeks ago, Jake,"
43:56;43:58;"and he said it sounds like ""War on Drugs."""
43:58;44:01;"Like, there's no way that Adam from ""War on Drugs"""
44:01;44:03;"is not a fan of this song."
44:03;44:05;"- Yeah, or that whole record. - Right, yeah."
44:05;44:07;"I was texting a little bit with a friend of the show,"
44:07;44:09;"- Bruce Hornsby. - As you do."
44:09;44:11;"He was at a restaurant in Virginia, and they were playing ""Harmony Hall."""
44:11;44:14;"He sent me a video. He's like, ""Check this out!"""
44:14;44:16;"And I was asking him about--"
44:16;44:18;"I was mentioning to him that I'd been listening a lot"
44:18;44:21;"to Bob Dylan's ""Greatest Hits, Volume 3,"""
44:21;44:24;"because I know he played a bit on the album ""Under the Red Sky,"""
44:24;44:26;"which I know you've been listening to a lot recently."
44:26;44:28;"- I have. - We'll talk about that more later."
44:28;44:30;"And, you know, Bruce has--"
44:30;44:32;"I've heard a few amazing Bob Dylan stories from him,"
44:32;44:35;"'cause he's been around him on that album and a few times left."
44:35;44:37;"And I just said to-- I was, like, random."
44:37;44:39;"I was like, ""It's so cool he puts these, like, unreleased songs"
44:39;44:42;"on his 'Greatest Hits.' It's so weird, but kind of, like, awesome."""
44:42;44:44;"And I was just like, ""You know the song 'Series of Dreams'?"""
44:44;44:47;"And he said-- I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this,"
44:47;44:51;"but this is the exact type of TC nugget that we love."
44:51;44:54;"And he said, ""Oh, yeah, yeah. I know 'Series of Dreams.'"
44:54;44:55;"That's an amazing song."""
44:55;44:57;"I was like, ""You know who showed me that,"
44:57;44:59;"who was really excited about that song and showed it to me?"
44:59;45:01;"- It was The Boss."" - Wow."
45:01;45:03;"Hell of a name drop there."
45:03;45:05;"- And there's something I just, like-- - Bruce on Bruce."
45:05;45:06;"Yeah, Bruce on Bruce."
45:06;45:08;"Next time Hornsby's on, we'll ask him specifically about this."
45:08;45:10;"But I-- So that's, like, the very short version."
45:10;45:12;"But I just love this idea, too, of--"
45:12;45:15;"'Cause clearly Bob was checking out Bruce."
45:15;45:17;"You could see his influence on Street Legal."
45:17;45:21;"But I also just love the idea of, like, Bruce being at, like,"
45:21;45:24;"driving into the city from Jersey,"
45:24;45:26;"hitting up Big Tower Records or something,"
45:26;45:28;"just, like, flipping through and just being like,"
45:28;45:29;"""Bob, greatest hits, volume three."""
45:29;45:31;"Be like, ""Eh, probably got all these."""
45:31;45:34;"But then he flips around the back and he's like, ""Well, hold on a second."
45:34;45:36;"'Series of Dreams.'"""
45:36;45:38;"""Series of Dreams."" And he buys it, and he, like,"
45:38;45:40;"immediately skips through all the ones he knows,"
45:40;45:42;"listens to Dignity, and he's, like, solid."
45:42;45:45;"And he's like, ""Series of Dreams,"" and he's just like, ""Whoa!"
45:45;45:47;"Weird, man. Whoa, interesting."""
45:47;45:50;"And enough that it's, like, on his mind that he's, like, you know,"
45:50;45:52;"later talking to other rockers, and he's just, like,"
45:52;45:55;"hanging out at some benefit, and, like, Hornsby's there,"
45:55;45:57;"and they're talking about trading Dylan stories."
45:57;46:01;"And Springsteen's just like, ""You ever heard of 'Series of Dreams'?"""
46:01;46:03;"Hornsby's like, ""What record's that on?"""
46:03;46:05;"And Springsteen's like, ""Get this, man."
46:05;46:08;"None. It's only on 'Greatest Hits, Volume Three.'"""
46:08;46:11;"""So, Bob. So, Bob, from the U.S.--"""
46:11;46:15;"And Hornsby's like, ""Well, s--t, man. I'll check it out."""
46:15;46:19;"Unless I misread that text, and Hornsby was just like, ""My boss."""
46:19;46:22;"And he was just like, ""I took a part-time job."""
46:22;46:25;"You know, the mid-'90s was getting out of the Hollywood rat race."
46:25;46:28;"I took a part-time job, and I had a pretty cool boss."
46:28;46:30;"Anyway, check out ""Series of Dreams,"""
46:30;46:32;"'cause this is exactly the type of song"
46:32;46:35;"that the casual Dylan fan needs to know."
46:35;46:38;"For the hardcore Dylan fans, this is, like, classic."
46:38;46:41;"But, you know, the casual listener, like me, didn't know it."
46:41;46:43;"Check it out. ""Series of Dreams."""
46:43;46:45;"From '89, but--"
46:45;46:47;"So, also, it's another outtake from ""O Mercy."""
46:47;46:48;"""O Mercy,"" yeah."
46:48;46:50;"So we got two ""O Mercy"" outtakes."
46:50;46:52;"And apparently, Daniel Lanois was like,"
46:52;46:54;"""You gotta open the record with this."""
46:54;46:56;"I mean, this is ""So You Too"" here."

56:40;56:42;"I just feel like this is a low point."
56:42;56:46;"And yet on this album, it contains this 11-minute song"
56:46;56:50;"called ""Brownsville Girl"" that the fans love."
56:50;56:52;"And actually, I read an interview with Bob"
56:52;56:54;"where it might have been that same one"
56:54;56:55;"where he talked about Taylor Swift,"
56:55;56:57;"where the guy said, ""Do you feel like you have any songs"
56:57;57:01;"""that people never really got the attention"
57:01;57:02;"""or the credit they deserved?"""
57:02;57:05;"And the first thing he says is, ""Yeah, 'Brownsville Girl.'"""
57:05;57:06;"- Oh, wow."
57:06;57:08;"- He was still on his mind years later."
57:08;57:11;"And this is a song that he's only played live once."
57:11;57:14;"And so of course I went trying to find that live version"
57:14;57:15;"and it's like, he doesn't even play it."
57:15;57:17;"He's just like, he's kind of singing the chorus."
57:17;57:18;"It's so weird."
57:18;57:21;"So basically, it's on a forgotten album,"
57:21;57:26;"never plays it live, and yet he knew that this song,"
57:26;57:29;"he needed to tell this story on volume three"
57:29;57:31;"and he pulled this song out, ""Brownsville Girl."""
57:31;57:34;"This might have some of his most all-time,"
57:34;57:36;"most insane '80s production,"
57:36;57:38;"which for some people will be a treat,"
57:38;57:39;"for some people will be a barrier."
57:39;57:41;"But let's check it out, ""Brownsville Girl."""
57:41;57:43;"And Jake, since you've heard this,"
57:43;57:44;"and I think we had the same experience,"
57:44;57:46;"you've had this one, especially on repeat."
57:46;57:49;"- Oh yeah, in the studio, top volume."
57:49;57:50;"- Yep."
57:50;57:52;"- ""Brownsville Girl"" on repeat."
57:52;57:54;"- Me too, I was in a hotel in Cleveland,"
57:54;57:55;"(laughing)"
57:55;57:57;"thinking, ""Should I go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
57:57;57:59;"or could I just keep blasting 'Brownsville Girl'"
57:59;58:00;"off my iPad?"""
58:00;58:02;"(laughing)"
58:02;58:03;"- Strong choice, my friend."
58:03;58:05;"- You know what choice I made."
58:05;58:06;"(laughing)"
58:11;58:14;"- A truly insane, epic song."
58:21;58:24;"- Well, there was this movie I seen one time"
58:26;58:28;"about a man riding across the desert"
58:28;58:31;"and it starred Gregory Peck."
58:31;58:32;"- Insane opening."
58:32;58:33;"- Yep."
58:33;58:35;"- He was shot down by a hungry kid"
58:35;58:38;"trying to make a name for himself."
58:58;59:00;"- Great vocal performance on this."
59:00;59:01;"- Yeah."
59:01;59:03;"- It's like talking and singing."
59:43;59:45;"- No chorus, he's just building up."
59:45;59:46;"- Yep."
59:51;59:54;"- And it's such like a weird psychedelic narrative."
59:54;59:57;"He's like, like he's thinking about a movie he saw."
59:57;59:59;"- He's like sort of recounting it?"
59:59;01:00:00;"- And yeah, you can't tell anymore"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"if he's talking about the movie"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"or he's talking about his own life."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"- Yeah."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"- Kind of a series of dreams."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- Damn."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"- San Antonio."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- I love Tex-Mex Bob."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"It's like romance and Durango."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- Tex-Mex Bob."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"(laughing)"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- Are there some other Tex-Mex Bob songs?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"- Play it on nachos, fully loaded."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"(laughing)"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"- Yeah."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- Fell down on the groove."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"- Oh, still no chorus."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"- They wait so long before getting to the chorus."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"- Yeah, we're at two and a half minutes."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"- You know what, this song is like,"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"it's like a Charlie Kaufman movie."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"It's like Synecdoche, New York or something,"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"where he's talking about the movie,"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"but then he's talking about his life"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"and different people."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- Yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"- Here we go."
