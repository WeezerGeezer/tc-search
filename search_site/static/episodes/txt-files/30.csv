00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, the final episode of the 2016 election cycle."
00:07;00:16;"We'll be talking to Felix from Chapo Trap House, as well as Jennifer Sines, Chief Marketing Officer of the Frito-Lay Corporation."
00:16;00:21;"All this, plus the hits of 2016 and 1964."
00:21;00:25;"Two days till the election. This is..."
00:25;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:46;00:53;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:16;"In a lonely bed"
01:16;01:21;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:21;01:28;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:28;01:34;"One of us is lying, one of us is lying"
01:34;01:39;"This is a really crazy Sunday. It's the Sunday before the election."
01:39;01:43;"Very stressful. Very stressful. Don't know who's gonna win."
01:43;01:46;"The good news is that we got a sick show today."
01:46;01:49;"We have two sick guests calling in."
01:49;01:57;"First up, we're gonna have Felix Biderman, who is a dude I've followed on Twitter for a long time."
01:57;02:02;"He's a writer and co-host of a podcast called Chapo Trap House."
02:02;02:04;"What's that podcast about?"
02:04;02:11;"Politics, basically. I guess they're guys you'd call left-leaning, but very funny."
02:11;02:17;"Then after that, we're gonna have probably, no disrespect to Felix, but probably the great, I imagine,"
02:17;02:21;"this is gonna be the greatest Time Crisis interview of all time."
02:21;02:24;"We got Jennifer Sines. You know who Jennifer Sines is?"
02:24;02:25;"I do."
02:25;02:26;"Who is she?"
02:26;02:32;"She is the chief marketing officer of the Frito-Lay Corporation of Plano, Texas."
02:32;02:36;"That's right. We've been talking a lot about snack foods over the past few months."
02:36;02:40;"We've been talking about Fritos, we've been talking about Doritos, we've been talking about Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
02:40;02:45;"But this is the first time we're actually gonna talk to somebody who works at the Frito-Lay Corporation."
02:45;02:48;"So she's the chief marketing officer, aka the CMO."
02:48;02:53;"She's gonna tell us about how do these brands get marketed, how do they come into our lives, what do they mean?"
02:53;02:55;"I'm really looking forward to that one."
02:55;02:59;"But anyway, like we said, Sunday before the election. How are you feeling, man?"
02:59;03:03;"I'm good. I'm really ready for it to be over."
03:03;03:04;"I've been hearing that a lot."
03:04;03:06;"I mean, I'm sure everyone feels that way."
03:06;03:09;"Yeah, I'm ready for it to be over. I don't know."
03:09;03:10;"Did you vote yet?"
03:10;03:11;"Yeah."
03:11;03:12;"Mail-in?"
03:12;03:14;"I mailed in my ballot to New York. It's interesting."
03:14;03:15;"Gary Johnson?"
03:15;03:18;"I had to support my man, Gary Johnson."
03:18;03:21;"I want a president who doesn't know what Aleppo is."
03:21;03:23;"That guy is such a tool."
03:23;03:26;"Oh, yeah, he's a weirdo."
03:26;03:30;"I mean, look, my heart definitely was with the Green Party."
03:30;03:35;"But you and many other people have convinced me to make a pragmatic decision."
03:35;03:36;"You have to."
03:36;03:40;"And here's the thing. I do feel bad about not voting for the Green Party."
03:40;03:44;"Why? Jill Stein doesn't seem... She's no Ralph Nader."
03:44;03:48;"The way people have gone in on Jill Stein is so lame."
03:48;03:53;"When I saw John Oliver roasting Jill Stein, trying to imply that she's anti-vaccines,"
03:53;03:59;"it's like, ""All right, man. Let's see you go that hard on some of the Democrats' goofball positions."
03:59;04:00;"I'm waiting."""
04:00;04:06;"To really try to disqualify the only candidate who wants to legalize weed,"
04:06;04:09;"has reasonable foreign policy ideas."
04:09;04:12;"I don't know. To roast somebody that hard and be like, ""What a weirdo."""
04:12;04:16;"You are doing a disservice, I think, to the public discourse."
04:16;04:17;"That's my point of view."
04:17;04:21;"I feel bad about not voting for her because the system is rigged against third parties."
04:21;04:24;"There's been a lot of talk of rigging in this election."
04:24;04:26;"The system is rigged against a lot of people."
04:26;04:28;"Not Donald Trump."
04:28;04:30;"Not rigged against Hillary."
04:30;04:32;"And the voting system is not rigged."
04:32;04:34;"No, but here's the thing, man."
04:34;04:39;"For the third parties, like the Greens, to qualify for federal funding,"
04:39;04:43;"they need to get 5% of the vote."
04:43;04:51;"It should be 1% because 5% is the perfect number to terrify left-leaning people into not voting."
04:51;04:55;"Because if you took away 5% of Hillary's lead, you would feel like you're electing Trump."
04:55;04:59;"So rather than just say, ""Hey, we'll give federal funding to the five biggest parties in America,"""
04:59;05:04;"they make it so hard for the third parties to even get a leg up."
05:04;05:05;"You know what's also crazy?"
05:05;05:09;"The Green Party has to fight to even get on the ballot in a lot of places."
05:09;05:10;"What kind of system is that?"
05:10;05:14;"You can't even just put the ten biggest parties in America on the ballot everywhere."
05:14;05:17;"To literally not put parties on the ballot?"
05:17;05:18;"That's rigged."
05:18;05:26;"Voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein is only going to diminish the amount by which"
05:26;05:29;"either candidate will win the popular vote."
05:29;05:33;"And if enough people do that, it might sway the vote one way or the other."
05:33;05:34;"I buy the pragmatic argument."
05:34;05:42;"That's why even in New York State, a solidly blue state, I wanted to contribute to the sound defeat of Donald Trump."
05:42;05:46;"But at the same time, I was doing something against my moral principles."
05:46;05:51;"I was voting for a party whose platform is fundamentally less ethical than the Greens."
05:51;05:52;"So what am I supposed to do, man?"
05:52;05:55;"It was a completely rational, pragmatic thing to do."
05:55;06:03;"So then tell me some rational, pragmatic things that I can do to make sure that the things that I believe in are supported by my government."
06:03;06:06;"Get super lefty people voted into Congress."
06:06;06:07;"Mayor."
06:07;06:08;"City Council."
06:08;06:10;"Sounds like a lot of work, man."
06:11;06:12;"Sure."
06:13;06:15;"It is a brand new rock."
06:15;06:18;"A bad, bad rock."
06:18;06:21;"This here revolution rock."
06:21;06:24;"Careful how you move, Mac."
06:24;06:25;"You dig me in the back."
06:25;06:28;"And I'm so pilled up that I rattle."
06:28;06:31;"I have got the sharpest knife, so I got the biggest slice."
06:31;06:34;"I got no time to do battle."
06:34;06:35;"Hey!"
06:35;06:40;"Everybody splash up your seats and rock to this brand new beat."
06:41;06:44;"This here music, Mac, shocks your nation."
06:44;06:47;"This here music causes sensation."
06:47;06:54;"You know, that's kind of the truth, is that probably a lot of us, we get so obsessed with the presidential election because it's glamorous."
06:54;06:56;"It's kind of easy, in a way."
06:56;07:00;"I'm not saying it's easy to run for president, but it's easy to be like, ""Who are you voting for for president?"""
07:00;07:02;"""Well, I like Hillary. Here's why."""
07:02;07:03;"""I like Jill Stein. Well, here's why."""
07:03;07:08;"And the truth is, I'm sure the Green Party has a lot of ideas, and I should probably read up on them."
07:08;07:13;"Because I'll tell you what, man. You and I, we have a lot of political conversations with all sorts of people,"
07:13;07:18;"but 97% of it gets taken up by Hillary and Donald."
07:18;07:22;"Just like you were talking about how you didn't know who your congressperson was."
07:22;07:23;"Right."
07:23;07:24;"You had to look it up."
07:24;07:25;"Right."
07:25;07:29;"And I'm not blaming you, because many people don't--they might know they're senators before they know they're congresspeople."
07:29;07:30;"You can't blame an individual."
07:30;07:35;"It's because when you go down to the bar, it's not a topic of conversation."
07:35;07:38;"You're chatting with everybody about the new Bon Iver album."
07:38;07:39;"Who?"
07:39;07:40;"[laughs]"
07:40;07:43;"So I'm curious with you, Jake. You're a California voter, right?"
07:43;07:44;"Yeah."
07:44;07:47;"Are you going to vote yes on legalizing marijuana?"
07:47;07:50;"I think so. I need to take a hard look at this stuff tonight."
07:50;07:53;"I was talking about it on Twitter a few days ago."
07:53;07:55;"Look, people have some real arguments."
07:55;08:02;"It's almost like an Obamacare argument that, yes, this will legalize weed the same way that Obamacare provided health care for more people,"
08:02;08:06;"but a lot of the language favors big business."
08:06;08:07;"Right."
08:07;08:13;"So it's a tough one, and there are ways that probably some people, small growers, could be victimized by it."
08:13;08:16;"But man, it'll have a big ripple impact if it passes."
08:16;08:20;"One other one. What's your feeling on condoms and porn?"
08:20;08:23;"That's another thing that all California voters will be voting on on Tuesday."
08:23;08:28;"That I don't know. What do the adult performers think?"
08:28;08:34;"It seems like the vast majority of the adult performers say we should get to choose if we use condoms and porn."
08:34;08:45;"It seems like the vast majority of the money going into the proposition to force all adult entertainers to use condoms was coming from one major AIDS organization."
08:45;08:49;"There's another one on the ballot this year. It's the death penalty one."
08:49;08:52;"About just like should we have it in California?"
08:52;08:53;"Yeah."
08:53;08:54;"What's your thought on that, man?"
08:54;08:55;"Absolutely not."
08:55;08:56;"I'm with you."
08:56;09:01;"I'm really not into the death penalty, but that's a heavy topic, obviously."
09:01;09:02;"It's a heavy topic."
09:02;09:06;"I was excited to see that that was on the ballot. It's not looking good."
09:06;09:07;"It's not going to pass?"
09:07;09:13;"People have a vengeful, irrational side to them that makes them want to vote for the death penalty."
09:13;09:14;"Man."
09:14;09:16;"I'm just preaching to the choir over here."
09:16;09:21;"If you're like an atheist, lefty type, I think you would oppose the death penalty."
09:21;09:28;"Also, if you're a deeply religious person, let God sort it out."
09:28;09:36;"If you've ever read the Bible, the Lord has no problem in exercising extreme vengeance on the wicked."
09:36;09:38;"So why does man have to do it?"
09:38;09:47;"So I guess the people that are for the death penalty are sort of like sort of Christians that are sort of vengeful and are just emotional."
09:47;09:51;"Look, man, you know what? You can spin any ideology to do what you want it to do."
09:51;09:52;"You know what I'm saying?"
09:52;09:53;"Of course."
09:53;10:00;"You can turn communism into a totalitarian nightmare, as has happened here and there."
10:00;10:07;"An ideology that's literally based on the premise that everybody should be equal and that--"
10:07;10:08;"Goombaya, yeah."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:09;10:14;"You can turn a religion of peace into a religion of violence, as we've seen with all major religions."
10:14;10:15;"Yeah."
10:15;10:23;"You can even turn something as rebellious as punk rock into a corporate sellout lame thing."
10:23;10:25;"It's disgusting what people do."
10:25;10:28;"You could turn the hippie dream into an American nightmare."
10:28;10:30;"Into a Nike ad."
10:30;10:31;"That's right."
10:31;10:34;"Gonna take a revolution."
10:34;10:41;"Yeah, why don't we listen to ""Revolution"" by the Beatles, a piece of art that's about revolution, but with kind of a sarcastic tone."
10:41;10:48;"Lenin was very cynical and sarcastic about the ""revolution"" that was happening."
10:48;10:50;"You know what year that song was from?"
10:50;10:51;"'68."
10:51;10:52;"You got it."
10:52;10:53;"A very tumultuous year."
10:53;10:57;"The 2016 of the '60s, as they say."
10:57;10:58;"Absolutely."
10:58;11:03;"So let's listen to that, and then we're gonna call Felix Biderman from Chapo Trap House."
11:03;11:04;"Politics."
11:04;11:20;"You say you want a revolution, well you know We all want to change the world"
11:20;11:37;"You tell me that it's evolution, well you know We all want to change the world"
11:37;12:06;"When you talk about destruction Don't you know that you can count me out"
12:06;12:26;"You say you got a real solution, well you know We don't love to see the power, should we do it?"
12:26;12:42;"You ask me for a contribution, well you know We all do it when we can, should we do it?"
12:42;12:53;"But if you want money for people with minds that hate Well all I can tell you is brother you have to wait"
12:53;12:57;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
12:57;12:58;"Alright."
12:58;13:01;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
13:01;13:02;"Alright."
13:02;13:06;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
13:06;13:07;"Alright."
13:07;13:14;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
13:14;13:27;"You say you'll change the constitution, well you know We don't love to change it, should we do it?"
13:27;13:56;"But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow"
13:56;14:00;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:00;14:01;"Alright."
14:01;14:04;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:04;14:05;"Alright."
14:05;14:09;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:09;14:10;"Alright."
14:10;14:27;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:27;14:28;"Alright."
14:28;14:31;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:31;14:32;"Alright."
14:32;14:35;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:35;14:36;"Alright."
14:36;14:41;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:41;14:42;"Alright."
14:42;14:48;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:48;14:49;"Alright."
14:49;14:52;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:52;14:53;"Alright."
14:53;14:56;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
14:56;14:57;"Alright."
14:57;15:00;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
15:00;15:01;"Alright."
15:01;15:04;"Don't you know it's gonna be, should we do it?"
15:04;15:05;"Alright."
15:05;15:06;"and your podcast."
15:06;15:08;"Can you tell us a little bit about yourself,"
15:08;15:09;"your perspective?"
15:09;15:12;"How do you describe your podcast Chappo Trap House"
15:12;15:17;"when uncles or people on the street ask you what you do?"
15:17;15:21;"- Chappo Trap House is media and politics podcast."
15:21;15:25;"We're one of the only ones that actually has production."
15:25;15:29;"We take a brass eye look at the media,"
15:29;15:33;"nothing is sacred except for the president"
15:33;15:35;"for life of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan,"
15:35;15:37;"one of the sponsors of the show"
15:37;15:42;"and the principles of Islamic justice and development."
15:42;15:44;"- Okay, I hear that."
15:44;15:48;"And so outside of being a hardcore supporter"
15:48;15:50;"of the president of Turkey,"
15:50;15:53;"how do you describe your political stance?"
15:53;15:55;"Because I followed you on Twitter for a long time"
15:55;16:00;"at by your logic and you and the Chappo guys,"
16:00;16:03;"you seem to be getting in a whole heaps of trouble."
16:03;16:05;"It seems like the Republicans don't like you,"
16:05;16:06;"but neither do the Democrats."
16:06;16:07;"What's up with that, man?"
16:07;16:10;"- Everyone gets mad at us all the time."
16:10;16:11;"We're like the deuce of hazard."
16:11;16:15;"You know, what did the boys get into this time?"
16:17;16:19;"- We is about to jump hollow Creek."
16:19;16:22;"- Which is exactly what Roscoe has in mind too,"
16:22;16:23;"to head off the boys."
16:23;16:28;"Friends, that's America."
16:28;16:30;"- Kind of pretty, ain't it?"
16:30;16:32;"- So we thought we would talk with you a little bit"
16:32;16:36;"as the election's about to end in a couple of days,"
16:36;16:38;"as somebody who's kind of studied"
16:38;16:42;"the way that political pundits and politicians"
16:42;16:44;"and just regular people communicate"
16:44;16:46;"about politics on Twitter."
16:46;16:48;"What are some of your favorite moments"
16:48;16:51;"in election Twitter 2016?"
16:51;16:53;"- There have been some great ones this year."
16:53;16:55;"It's hard to pick some singular moments"
16:55;16:59;"because every day was equally parts hilarious"
16:59;17:00;"and terrifying."
17:00;17:03;"One of the funniest days of this year"
17:03;17:06;"was the day that Hillary fainted."
17:06;17:09;"The liberal commentators spent the first half"
17:09;17:12;"of the day going, what are you talking about?"
17:12;17:17;"It's totally normal to faint when it's 79 degrees out."
17:17;17:19;"Being outside in that weather could kill you."
17:19;17:22;"I faint all the time."
17:22;17:25;"You know, just stopping short of recording themselves"
17:25;17:28;"falling downstairs and saying it's how they get home."
17:28;17:31;"Then I remember it came out that she had pneumonia,"
17:31;17:32;"which, you know, it's fine."
17:32;17:33;"People get pneumonia."
17:33;17:35;"She's 70 years old, it happens."
17:35;17:39;"But just showed the caginess and weirdness"
17:39;17:41;"of the Clinton campaign."
17:41;17:42;"They didn't tell anyone this."
17:42;17:47;"And the crazy Clinton loyalists diehards went,"
17:47;17:52;"this proves that she is the strongest woman on earth."
17:53;17:56;"She is invincible."
17:56;17:57;"There was a part where one guy said,"
17:57;17:59;"you know, one time I had pneumonia"
17:59;18:00;"and it's really tough to have"
18:00;18:03;"because the antibiotics I had to get"
18:03;18:04;"were the same kind you get for STDs"
18:04;18:07;"and I felt shamed by the pharmacist."
18:07;18:09;"No one was around to tell that guy"
18:09;18:11;"that no one thought he had sex."
18:11;18:14;"But I remember just watching all of this"
18:14;18:19;"and I was in my room and I was taking it all in"
18:19;18:21;"and I just started laughing so hard I was crying"
18:21;18:23;"because I saw an article title."
18:23;18:27;"It was like, Hillary proves once and for all"
18:27;18:31;"that she has never lied and she is invincible."
18:31;18:32;"And I was like, this is such a good day."
18:32;18:33;"So there was that one."
18:33;18:37;"- Right, it was a perfect situation to see"
18:37;18:41;"the nuttiness of the Clinton diehards"
18:41;18:42;"and the Trump diehards."
18:42;18:44;"So what were some other classic days"
18:44;18:45;"for you in this election?"
18:45;18:46;"- You know, when they came out"
18:46;18:48;"with the Trump access Hollywood tape,"
18:48;18:50;"so that was a good day."
18:50;18:51;"My favorite account on Twitter,"
18:51;18:54;"my favorite guy that I found during this election"
18:54;18:58;"is a very enthusiastic Trump supporter named Bill Mitchell."
18:58;19:00;"You may have seen him."
19:00;19:00;"- Yes."
19:00;19:03;"- Yeah, he looks like Patrick Warburton."
19:03;19:04;"He's just very enthusiastic."
19:04;19:07;"I like, he's just like, he's fun to watch"
19:07;19:10;"and he just says the most ridiculous things"
19:10;19:13;"about why Trump is gonna win by a landslide."
19:13;19:15;"And you know, these tapes were disgusting."
19:15;19:17;"It was Trump describing sexual assault."
19:17;19:18;"- Yeah."
19:18;19:19;"- At the best of it, maybe you could argue"
19:19;19:21;"that he sounds like he's never had sex"
19:21;19:23;"and was just trying to impress Billy Bush,"
19:23;19:25;"which is not great either."
19:25;19:30;"But he went, look at the Bible, David, sinner,"
19:30;19:33;"Paul, he killed Christians before he was saved."
19:33;19:35;"The Bible is filled with flawed men."
19:35;19:37;"That was Trump before he found God."
19:37;19:39;"You know, no one is perfect."
19:39;19:42;"Jesus Christ was perfect"
19:42;19:45;"and he was crucified by the media of his day."
19:45;19:47;"And I was like, triple parentheses,"
19:47;19:49;"media of Jesus Christ's day."
19:49;19:53;"Triple parentheses, media killed Christ."
19:53;19:55;"That was a good day for the good men online."
19:55;19:58;"- Right, it increasingly seems that somebody like Trump"
19:58;20:02;"does something so brazenly insane"
20:02;20:05;"that you're gonna get these bizarre reactions,"
20:05;20:08;"either explaining why it's okay"
20:08;20:11;"or using it as an opportunity to kind of big up yourself"
20:11;20:13;"for not being as horrible as Donald Trump."
20:13;20:16;"How about one more, one more just great moment for you"
20:16;20:20;"in this election in terms of the reactions?"
20:20;20:22;"- Okay, I would say it was,"
20:22;20:26;"there's a Newsweek reporter,"
20:26;20:28;"I'm not gonna say his name"
20:28;20:31;"because he's a very paranoid guy."
20:31;20:34;"He thinks he's being targeted by the Russian government"
20:34;20:37;"for reporting against Trump for Newsweek."
20:37;20:40;"Since about like August of this year,"
20:40;20:42;"he'll have a, what he says,"
20:42;20:44;"a huge election changing story about Trump."
20:44;20:47;"And it's not as if Trump did some scummy business thing,"
20:47;20:48;"which of course he did."
20:48;20:51;"He's a business man in America."
20:51;20:54;"And he'll post a screenshot of someone emailing him,"
20:54;20:56;"like, gargle my sack, Kurt."
20:56;20:57;"And he'll be like, look,"
20:57;21:00;"this is the Russian government is trying to kill me."
21:00;21:03;"But this was a great year for personal demons"
21:03;21:06;"and chasing after phantoms"
21:06;21:11;"and accusing everybody of a Rico-like racketeering conspiracy"
21:11;21:13;"of harassment."
21:13;21:18;"Really anything except for issues of wars or wages"
21:18;21:20;"or paid maternity leave or anything like that."
21:20;21:23;"Like if you care about that stuff, terrible year for you."
21:23;21:28;"But if you like personality defects, terrific year."
21:28;21:30;"- Right, it seems like this year,"
21:30;21:35;"a lot of energy was taken up by bizarre online feuds,"
21:35;21:38;"paranoia, and very little discussion"
21:38;21:41;"of some fundamental issues that are affecting people's lives."
21:41;21:43;"Thanks for calling in, Felix."
21:43;21:45;"Check out Chapo Trap House."
21:45;21:47;"Where do you just go onto iTunes?"

24:10;24:12;"I said Biederman before."
24:12;24:13;"I should know better about how to pronounce"
24:13;24:15;"German last names."
24:15;24:18;"Co-host of Chapo Trap House,"
24:18;24:21;"roaster of political punditry on Twitter."
24:21;24:23;"I think maybe we need a break from Politrix."
24:23;24:25;"We've had a pretty Politrix heavy opening."
24:25;24:27;"- Yeah, I feel kinda ill."
24:27;24:29;"- Too much Politrix?"
24:29;24:30;"- It's just exhausting."
24:30;24:32;"Just existentially heavy."
24:32;24:33;"- I know, man."
24:33;24:37;"- I wasn't in love with our last guest's energy."
24:37;24:38;"Kinda brought me down a little bit."
24:38;24:39;"- What about it?"
24:39;24:40;"- I just thought it was kinda catty."
24:40;24:44;"I thought he was reducing this very stark choice"
24:44;24:47;"between these two candidates to sort of petty"
24:47;24:50;"kind of watching punditry for sport perspective."
24:50;24:51;"I don't know, it didn't really speak to me."
24:51;24:52;"- I'd make a case for it."
24:52;24:55;"I think it's important that we have people calling out"
24:55;24:57;"the pundits on both sides."
24:57;24:59;"'Cause I don't think it benefits us"
24:59;25:03;"as much as my heart will always be with the left"
25:03;25:06;"and will always be with the Democrats over the Republicans."
25:06;25:08;"If we can't criticize the goofball,"
25:08;25:12;"cult of personality stuff that happens on the left too,"
25:12;25:13;"I don't think it bodes well for the future."
25:13;25:16;"And really, there have been some nutty, nutty people"
25:16;25:17;"in this election."
25:17;25:18;"'Cause you and I both know,"
25:18;25:20;"we don't need to believe that Hillary's amazing"
25:20;25:21;"to vote for her."
25:21;25:25;"- No, she's a flawed but competent and sane human."
25:25;25:26;"- Yeah, but unfortunately we also know"
25:26;25:28;"that competent and sane presidents before her,"
25:28;25:32;"like say her husband, can sometimes enact policies"
25:32;25:33;"that feel insane."
25:33;25:35;"- I'm not here saying she's an angel."
25:35;25:37;"- I think we gotta hold the pundits' feet to the fire."
25:37;25:40;"- I feel so much anxiety about this election."
25:40;25:43;"- And you don't like hearing anybody who could remotely--"
25:43;25:44;"- Sometimes you gotta play defense"
25:44;25:46;"and just keep your eye on the ball."
25:46;25:48;"And that's all I'm saying right now."
25:48;25:50;"You just gotta, like, let's not try to juggle"
25:50;25:51;"too many balls right now."
25:51;25:53;"It's like November."
25:53;25:54;"- I'm with you, man."
25:54;25:55;"- She needs to win."
25:55;25:56;"- Yeah, she needs to win."
25:56;25:59;"I agree, and hopefully Bernie stays active"
25:59;26:01;"and is an active voice out there."
26:01;26:04;"I mean, but right now, let's just play defense."
26:04;26:05;"That's where I'm at."
26:05;26:06;"- I'm with you."
26:06;26:07;"Trump must lose."
26:07;26:08;"That means Hillary must win."
26:08;26:09;"I voted for her."
26:09;26:10;"- Boom."
26:10;26:11;"- I encourage everybody to vote for her."
26:11;26:12;"- Boom."
26:12;26:15;"- Let's readdress this in January, man."
26:15;26:15;"Let's read--"
26:15;26:16;"- Sorry, listeners."
26:16;26:18;"I'm just having a meltdown over here."
26:18;26:19;"- Okay, you know what, man?"
26:19;26:20;"That's enough about the election."
26:20;26:22;"Everybody's already on edge."
26:22;26:25;"You're bringing all that stressed out,"
26:25;26:27;"negative energy to the show, man."
26:27;26:31;"People are just chilling, taking a nice Sunday autumn walk."
26:31;26:34;"Everybody, it's stressful."
26:34;26:36;"So let's talk about something other than politics."
26:36;26:37;"Let's get back into music."

27:42;27:45;"of Hillary being the first female president."
27:45;27:46;"- Yeah."
27:46;27:48;"- But there's a lot of other stuff happening"
27:48;27:51;"in the world of gender and firsts."
27:51;27:52;"- Okay."
27:52;27:57;"- For instance, Bono just became the first man"
27:57;28:01;"to make Glamour's Women of the Year list."
28:01;28:02;"- Bono, from U2?"
28:02;28:03;"- Bono, the singer from U2."
28:03;28:07;"He was the first man to ever be on Glamour's"
28:07;28:09;"Women of the Year list."
28:09;28:11;"According to Consequence of Sound,"
28:11;28:13;"it's a beautiful day for Bono."
28:13;28:15;"This is an unprecedented move."
28:15;28:17;"We've talked for years about whether to honor a man"
28:17;28:17;"at Woman of the Year,"
28:17;28:19;"and we've always kind of put the kibosh on it."
28:19;28:23;"Glamour editor-in-chief, Cindy Leve, explained,"
28:23;28:24;"""You know, men get a lot of awards"
28:24;28:25;"""and aren't exactly hurting"

28:36;28:39;"He's done a lot of work to try to wake people up"
28:39;28:43;"about gender inequality, and his one campaign"
28:43;28:46;"did a big thing called Poverty is Sexist,"
28:46;28:47;"where they're trying to explain the way"
28:47;28:51;"that women are often the biggest victims of poverty."
28:51;28:53;"Does that make you feel good, man?"
28:53;28:54;"To know that whatever--"
28:54;28:56;"- That just seems like, who was that, Glamour magazine?"
28:56;28:57;"- That's right."
28:57;28:59;"- That just seems like them trying to get people"
28:59;29:01;"to look at their magazine."
29:01;29:03;"- Man, I really thought that one would cheer you up."
29:03;29:04;"You're really--"
29:04;29:06;"- No, that to me is just like--"
29:06;29:07;"- Look, whatever--"
29:07;29:08;"- And they're just making about them,"
29:08;29:11;"making a weird categorization."
29:11;29:11;"It's not--"
29:11;29:14;"- Okay, but I'm just saying, whatever happens on Tuesday,"
29:14;29:15;"I wanna make you feel good to know"
29:15;29:17;"that Bono's on the Women of the Year list."
29:17;29:18;"- No."
29:18;29:19;"- Really?"
29:19;29:20;"Are you just not a U2 fan, man?"
29:20;29:22;"Is that what this is about?"
29:22;29:23;"- That's kinda interesting."
29:23;29:24;"I mean, I like some U2."
29:24;29:26;"(laughing)"
29:26;29:28;"- What's your favorite U2 song?"
29:28;29:30;"- I'd have to say ""One."""
29:30;29:30;"- Yeah, that's a good one."
29:30;29:32;"- ""One's"" pretty unimpeachable."
29:32;29:35;"There's some good cuts, some other good deep cuts"
29:35;29:36;"off ""Octoon."""
29:36;29:38;"- Octung."
29:38;29:40;"- Octoon, Octung, baby."
29:40;29:41;"Where you at with U2?"
29:41;29:43;"- Always respected them."
29:43;29:44;"- Yeah."
29:44;29:45;"- You know, they're the type of band"
29:45;29:49;"that when I was coming of age in the mid to late 90s,"
29:49;29:52;"they were so meaningful to other people."
29:52;29:54;"You know how when other people get so into something,"
29:54;29:57;"even though you like it, you kind of are like,"
29:57;29:58;"well, it's not my thing."
29:58;29:59;"- Yeah."
29:59;30:01;"- So I deeply like U2."
30:01;30:03;"I like the early punky stuff."
30:03;30:05;"Sunday, Bloody Sunday, great."
30:05;30:06;"I also love ""One."""
30:06;30:08;"I even like the kinda later stuff,"

31:44;31:47;"Exactly, I respect them, I like them."
31:47;31:49;"You know, one thing U2 deserves credit for"
31:49;31:52;"is that they developed like a real sense of humor"
31:52;31:54;"around the ""Ah-Tung Baby"" era."
31:54;31:57;"They transitioned from the '80s to the '90s very gracefully."
31:57;31:58;"- Yeah. - And that was a very"
31:58;32:00;"difficult transition for most rock bands."
32:00;32:03;"They went from their mid-'80s Joshua Tree earnestness"
32:03;32:06;"to kind of starting to wear makeup,"
32:06;32:08;"be a little more satirical."
32:08;32:11;"- Yeah, I don't know if it's like humorous per se,"
32:11;32:15;"but it's like self-conscious or something."
32:15;32:18;"- Yeah, like slightly ironic, post-modern."
32:18;32:19;"I'm just saying like the '80s and '90s"
32:19;32:21;"had very different sensibilities,"
32:21;32:22;"especially for U2."

42:50;42:53;"but this might be the one we've been the most excited about"

42:56;42:58;"on the show before. -I have to say,"
42:58;43:00;"I'm a little intimidated. That's some pretty good company"

43:02;43:04;"This is the one that we've been the most nervous about"

43:06;43:08;"-Lately on the show, we've been talking more and more"
43:08;43:11;"about marketing, specifically the Frito-Lay Corporation,"
43:11;43:13;"so we're very excited to talk to you."
43:13;43:15;"-Okay. -So before we start talking"
43:15;43:18;"Frito-Lay, we also just like to know about people's lives."
43:18;43:20;"-Yeah. -So can you give us"
43:20;43:23;"kind of a synopsis 'cause obviously"
43:23;43:25;"you weren't born chief marketing officer"
43:25;43:28;"of Frito-Lay Corporation, so can you give us"
43:28;43:30;"a little bit of your backstory, where you're from,"
43:30;43:33;"your career path? Take us back to the beginning."
43:33;43:36;"-Absolutely. So I actually grew up split"
43:36;43:39;"between upstate New York and a little, little, tiny"
43:39;43:41;"place called the Thousand Islands,"
43:41;43:44;"which is literally 10,000 little islands"
43:44;43:46;"on the St. Lawrence River."
43:46;43:48;"Went to college at Emory University."
43:48;43:50;"I loved art and art history,"
43:50;43:52;"so I studied art and art history,"
43:52;43:55;"studied in Italy, but then I also knew"
43:55;43:57;"I needed to do something practical,"
43:57;44:00;"so I also studied finance. -Double major?"
44:00;44:02;"-Double major, art history and finance,"
44:02;44:05;"which is not one that you come across very often,"
44:05;44:06;"I would say. -No."
44:06;44:09;"-And then I found marketing as just an awesome blend"
44:09;44:12;"of art and creativity and imagination,"
44:12;44:15;"but also really great business savvy."
44:15;44:18;"And I started my job at Frito-Lay actually"
44:18;44:21;"as an intern between my first and second year."
44:21;44:23;"-So in your career at Frito-Lay, you went from"
44:23;44:25;"intern to chief marketing officer."
44:25;44:28;"How long did that take? -It took me 11 years."
44:28;44:30;"-That's not a lot of time. -Wow."
44:30;44:32;"-It's not a lot of time. -It's not quite Obama"
44:32;44:35;"state senator to president in, what, seven years?"
44:35;44:38;"But it's close. -It's close."
44:38;44:40;"-How old are you, if you don't mind us asking?"
44:40;44:42;"-So I am--that's a great question."
44:42;44:44;"I don't think about it very often. I'm 38."
44:44;44:47;"-So you're 38. You're right in between Jake and I."
44:47;44:49;"That's very young to be the chief marketing officer"
44:49;44:51;"of a huge company like that, no?"
44:51;44:53;"-I think it is. I don't know what kind of"
44:53;44:55;"average age of a CMO is, but I think it is."
44:55;44:57;"I think it's on the younger side."
44:57;45:00;"-So one thing that we always talk about on the show"
45:00;45:05;"is the ways in which kind of attitudes towards branding"
45:05;45:08;"and snack foods have changed so much generationally."
45:08;45:10;"Even like we talk about in our own lives,"
45:10;45:13;"you know, you used to roll up to a kid's house,"
45:13;45:16;"it's a big old snack drawer filled with things"
45:16;45:21;"that a lot of parents today would be disgusted by."
45:21;45:24;"So it's interesting, I think, because you're about our age,"
45:24;45:26;"that for you to be coming into a company"
45:26;45:29;"that's so associated with the old world of snacking--"
45:29;45:31;"so I'm very interested in this innovation thing."
45:31;45:35;"So when you came to Frito-Lay, what did the future look like?"
45:35;45:37;"Were people starting to get nervous"
45:37;45:40;"when things like potato chips are being increasingly associated"
45:40;45:42;"with an old way of eating?"
45:42;45:44;"What was the landscape like for you?"
45:44;45:46;"-So from a portfolio standpoint,"
45:46;45:49;"we've always tried to look at our portfolio"
45:49;45:51;"and just understand a couple of things."
45:51;45:54;"One, what do consumers want to be snacking on?"
45:54;45:57;"What do they love about snacking? What are they looking for?"
45:57;45:59;"And we want to make sure that we have"
45:59;46:02;"just a portfolio of options that fill that."
46:02;46:04;"When you think about Frito-Lay,"
46:04;46:07;"you think about those core brands that we're known for--"
46:07;46:10;"Lay's, Doritos, Fritos, Ruffles--"
46:10;46:12;"those are brands that people think about."
46:12;46:16;"But we have just a massive portfolio of options."
46:16;46:18;"-Can we ask you about a few specific brands?"
46:18;46:19;"-Sure."
46:19;46:21;"-So kind of our fascination with Frito-Lay--"
46:21;46:23;"I don't know if you remember this, Jake--"
46:23;46:26;"it all began with a tweet that I saw,"
46:26;46:28;"but it was a kid making a joke"
46:28;46:31;"that when you buy the Frito-Lay variety pack,"
46:31;46:36;"what you're left with at the end is invariably the Fritos."
46:36;46:38;"So then we were talking that maybe Fritos"
46:38;46:40;"is an older person's snack,"
46:40;46:42;"and then we actually started reading more and more about Fritos,"
46:42;46:45;"and we heard that actually Fritos gets very little marketing"
46:45;46:47;"because it's almost like a heritage brand."
46:47;46:49;"So we're very curious about, like,"
46:49;46:52;"where do you see Fritos specifically in today's marketplace,"
46:52;46:55;"especially with regard to Doritos?"
46:55;46:57;"-So the Fritos brand is a great brand."
46:57;47:00;"If you actually think about the company and who we are,"
47:00;47:02;"our company name is Frito-Lay."
47:02;47:03;"It's our namesake."
47:03;47:06;"And actually the very first product in our portfolio,"
47:06;47:09;"if you go way back, was Fritos."
47:09;47:10;"I think it was 1932."
47:10;47:14;"Fritos was started by Elmer Doolin in San Antonio, Texas."
47:14;47:18;"He was actually a confectioner, so he had candy shops,"
47:18;47:21;"and he was looking for something to supplement on the counter"
47:21;47:24;"what could they sell, and he started selling Fritos,"
47:24;47:26;"and then his wife was developing all these recipes."
47:26;47:31;"She was marketing them, and it actually grew in popularity,"
47:31;47:34;"and he sold them out of the back of his Model T."
47:34;47:37;"So when you think about heritage, I would say, yeah, absolutely."
47:37;47:39;"It is one of our heritage brands."
47:39;47:40;"It's our namesake."
47:40;47:43;"As a brand, you know, it's always been really unique,"
47:43;47:45;"and it's always been part of Americana."
47:45;47:46;"You're right."
47:46;47:50;"We don't do a lot of activity with Fritos."
47:50;47:55;"It's always been a business that actually doesn't need much to grow,"
47:55;47:56;"and consumers love it."
47:56;47:58;"So we don't talk about it as much."
47:58;48:02;"If you contrast that with something like a Doritos,"
48:02;48:04;"Doritos is another brand that people love,"
48:04;48:07;"but it's positioned a bit differently than Fritos."
48:07;48:09;"It's positioned a bit more cutting edge,"
48:09;48:14;"definitely got a bold positioning that forces us to think deeply"
48:14;48:18;"about how to reinvent and engage consumers who are looking for"
48:18;48:20;"what is that next thing."
48:20;48:24;"Right, because it feels like every few months there's some new type of Doritos,"
48:24;48:27;"whereas Fritos is very stable."
48:27;48:29;"It's loved just the way it is, and it's funny."
48:29;48:33;"If you try to do a lot with a Fritos, it's a thicker -- if you eat it,"
48:33;48:35;"you know, just do a side-by-side."
48:35;48:38;"It's a really thick, heavy corn flavor."
48:38;48:42;"We do some flavors with it, but the flavors on a Fritos usually have to be"
48:42;48:46;"pretty intense to have the flavor come through from a carrier standpoint."
48:46;48:49;"So this is super nerdy, like snack talk stuff."
48:49;48:55;"But if you think about the bases on a chip -- so think about a potato chip"
48:55;48:57;"and think about what a potato does."
48:57;48:59;"This is, like, super nerdy."
48:59;49:03;"A potato in itself, because it's all starch, dissolves just in your mouth."
49:03;49:07;"It melts away, and what you're left with is just the flavor."
49:07;49:12;"So there's not a lot that competes on a potato chip with the flavor that"
49:12;49:14;"you're trying to have come through in the seasoning."
49:14;49:17;"That's why when we do programs like Do Us a Flavor, if you guys are familiar"
49:17;49:23;"with that, we can do these really wacky, almost Willy Wonka-esque flavors."
49:23;49:25;"Oh, when you come up with your own fillets, right."
49:25;49:26;"Like a room-made sandwich."
49:26;49:27;"Yeah."
49:27;49:35;"♪ Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination ♪"
49:35;49:42;"♪ Take a look and you'll see into your imagination ♪"
49:42;49:46;"Because of the profile of a potato chip and the way you eat it,"
49:46;49:50;"versus corn has a really unique flavor to it."
49:50;49:55;"And when you do heavy corn, like in a Fritos, that's a pretty heavy flavor"
49:55;49:57;"that you have to overcome with seasoning."
49:57;50:01;"So just the nature of the products and the flexibility for what you can do"
50:01;50:05;"with it determine a little bit of the direction of where the brand can go."
50:05;50:06;"Right."
50:06;50:09;"So Fritos is somewhat limited in the directions you can take it,"
50:09;50:10;"almost on a chemical level."
50:10;50:11;"Yeah."
50:11;50:12;"But you know what?"
50:12;50:13;"It's an awesome product as is."
50:13;50:18;"The characteristics that it has, that hearty corn crunch that you can do,"
50:18;50:21;"it's actually a really great base to cook with,"
50:21;50:24;"which is why people do a lot of things like Frito pie and the popularity"
50:24;50:29;"of using it in recipes because of that heavy structure."
50:29;50:32;"You can't do that with some of our other brands because they're just"
50:32;50:33;"not made that way."
50:33;50:36;"So you kind of need to know what's the sweet spot of the product,"
50:36;50:39;"what's that product truth that comes through in the experience for the"
50:39;50:43;"consumer, and then make sure that you're growing it in line"
50:43;50:44;"with those expectations."
50:44;50:49;"If we try to make a Fritos perform like a Blaze or Doritos or something like"
50:49;50:53;"that from just a delivery, people would be a little bit disappointed."
50:53;50:54;"Right."
50:54;50:56;"And so since these products are so different, and as you said,"
50:56;51:00;"you have to position them differently, do you associate a type of consumer?"
51:00;51:04;"Like you see a guy on the street, you see like the type of hat he's wearing,"
51:04;51:06;"you're like, ""That's a Fritos, man."""
51:06;51:08;"You see like a kid rolling up on a skateboard all wearing Supreme,"
51:08;51:10;"you're like, ""That's a Doritos guy."""
51:10;51:14;"Or is there like a classical consumer for each product?"
51:14;51:16;"Or how do you think about it?"
51:16;51:19;"What we try to think about is just like what is the psychographic,"
51:19;51:21;"kind of like what's the mindset of these individuals."
51:21;51:26;"The demographics that you talk about, hey, it's an age, it's a male or a female,"
51:26;51:29;"certain things where we feel like we can categorize people,"
51:29;51:32;"the demographics, the statistic almost."
51:32;51:34;"A psychographic is a little bit more mindset-based."
51:34;51:35;"It's attitudinal."
51:35;51:38;"So is this person optimistic?"
51:38;51:40;"Are they joyful?"
51:40;51:43;"Do they think and believe certain values?"
51:43;51:47;"That's actually what we associate our brands with more is we try to think about"
51:47;51:49;"the psychographics that appeal to people."
51:49;51:55;"So in the example that you talk about with Doritos, it's a really bold brand."
51:55;51:57;"The product itself is bold."
51:57;52:00;"It's tooth-rattling, bold crunch, bold flavor."
52:00;52:06;"And the consumers who are drawn to Doritos, the people who love that brand,"
52:06;52:10;"are typically fairly bold in their action and their beliefs and the way they live"
52:10;52:12;"and the interest that they have."
52:12;52:14;"They tend to be a bit bolder."
52:14;52:17;"And that boldness exists across all age groups."
52:17;52:19;"Does it have a tendency to be younger?"
52:19;52:24;"The answer is yes, there's certainly a tendency for things to go a certain way."
52:24;52:29;"But we really try to think more about what is that mindset and belief"
52:29;52:31;"and play to that with all of our marketing."
52:31;52:32;"Right."
52:32;52:36;"Which brand in the portfolio do you think is the most optimistic?"
52:36;52:40;"Like which corresponds to the optimistic psychographic subset?"
52:40;52:44;"We often think that Lays is really that optimistic."
52:44;52:46;"Think about the logo of Lays."
52:46;52:49;"It's sunny and it's bright and it's colorful."
52:49;52:50;"It's pretty optimistic."
52:50;52:54;"And even the associations of the occasions that people have"
52:54;52:56;"are pretty happy occasions."
52:56;53:00;"Think about backyard barbecues and days at the beach."
53:00;53:05;"There's usually a sense of kind of joyfulness that comes out of those occasions."
53:05;53:08;"So that's one that we think is pretty optimistic."
53:08;53:11;"So then I've got to ask, which is the most pessimistic?"
53:11;53:13;"Oh, pessimistic."
53:13;53:15;"There's nothing sad about snacking."
53:15;53:17;"It's all happy."
53:17;53:19;"I don't think we have a pessimistic brand in the bunch."
53:19;53:23;"Maybe the late-night cheeseburger Dorito."
53:23;53:25;"No, there's nothing pessimistic about that."
53:25;53:27;"The night's just getting started."
53:27;53:28;"You need fuel."
53:28;53:29;"Fourth meal."
53:29;53:31;"That's right."
53:31;53:34;"We might as well--if we're pouring something,"
53:34;53:39;"we ought to try to get a little nutrition in our bodies as well here tonight."
53:39;53:42;"I'm smelling those grilled sausages from outside the park on Yaki Way."
53:42;53:44;"I don't know."
53:44;53:48;"Grilled sausage, cheeseburger, grilled sausage, cheeseburger."
53:48;53:52;"Cheeseburger, cheeseburger."
53:52;53:58;"We noticed recently that Fritos chose Garth Brooks as a collaborative spokesman,"
53:58;54:02;"and you guys were giving out a free--it was a free Garth Brooks song"
54:02;54:04;"that you got a download code on the Fritos."
54:04;54:05;"Yeah."
54:05;54:07;"So I'm just kind of curious about how that came about,"
54:07;54:11;"the ways in which you felt like Garth was an appropriate choice for Fritos"
54:11;54:13;"versus any other brand you could have paired him with."
54:13;54:14;"Absolutely."
54:14;54:18;"That was just--I mean, such a fun program that we're doing with Garth."
54:18;54:24;"He's just an amazingly collaborative person, very kind, very generous with his time."
54:24;54:28;"So I don't have enough good things to say about Garth Brooks as an individual."
54:28;54:33;"So when we thought about the partnership and the opportunity to partner with Garth,"
54:33;54:37;"there was a couple of things about it that were just really impressive to us."
54:37;54:42;"One, he had never given out a single before in any of his music."
54:42;54:45;"He's never actually allowed the release of a single."
54:45;54:51;"He's the single highest-selling album artist of all time in the United States,"
54:51;54:53;"like bigger than anybody that you've seen."
54:53;54:55;"He's got seven Diamond Awards."
54:55;54:57;"It's really, truly amazing."
54:57;55:00;"But he had never released a single to the public for download."
55:00;55:05;"And when we were talking about this partnership, we said, ""Hey, could we release a single?"""
55:05;55:08;"He's like, ""Okay, let's do it."""
55:08;55:10;"So he released a single with us."
55:10;55:13;"And a couple of other things when we thought about him as a partner,"
55:13;55:16;"it goes back to some of those brand values that we had talked about earlier,"
55:16;55:20;"like what makes a brand really unique and special in consumers' minds."
55:20;55:22;"What does it stand for?"
55:22;55:23;"The boldness of Doritos."
55:23;55:29;"Well, for Fritos, it's really being authentic, being genuine."
55:29;55:35;"That sense of Americana and heritage is actually part of the DNA of the Fritos brand."
55:35;55:38;"And when you think about someone like Garth Brooks,"
55:38;55:45;"he's very similar from a personality standpoint as Fritos, super genuine, really authentic,"
55:45;55:48;"like a kind of traditional American soul."
55:48;55:52;"And, of course, it helps that he actually personally loves Fritos."
55:52;55:56;"He eats them, and his wife, Trisha Yearwood, she cooks with Fritos,"
55:56;55:58;"and they talk about Fritos pie and stuff."
55:58;56:03;"So, one, they're brand lovers, and it was a really natural fit from a narrative standpoint."
56:03;56:04;"It makes a lot of sense."
56:04;56:08;"We heard that you're going to see Adele tonight. Is that true?"
56:08;56:09;"I am."
56:09;56:13;"I thought it might be fun just to try to do a little lightning round."
56:13;56:14;"I'm just curious."
56:14;56:15;"All right."
56:15;56:19;"After the show tonight, a security guard comes over and says,"
56:19;56:22;"""Jennifer, we heard you're the CMO of Frito-Lay's."
56:22;56:23;"Adele would like to speak with you."""
56:23;56:28;"And she says, ""Jennifer, which brand in your portfolio can I work with?"""
56:28;56:30;"What's the first thing that comes to mind for you?"
56:30;56:33;"Adele, what she represents, which brand would she pair with?"
56:33;56:35;"Stacy's Pita Chips."
56:35;56:37;"Okay, interesting. I didn't know that was in your portfolio."
56:37;56:43;"How about this? If you think of Cool Ranch Doritos, what would be the ideal band to match that?"
56:43;56:44;"The dream partnership."
56:44;56:47;"For me personally, oh, man, I'm so uncool."
56:47;56:50;"Doritos, Cool Ranch, I'd probably go with something reggae, actually."
56:50;56:51;"Oh, okay."
56:51;56:52;"I don't know why."
56:52;56:53;"I see that."
56:53;56:55;"Something reggae. Something kind of chill. It's Cool Ranch."
56:55;56:57;"It's a little bit of the chill version of bold."
56:57;56:59;"It's got some attitude. It's got some swagger."
56:59;57:00;"Like that?"
57:00;57:01;"That's what I associate reggae with."
57:01;57:02;"Maybe UB40?"
57:02;57:03;"Yeah, it could be UB40."
57:03;57:04;"Maybe."
57:04;57:05;"Okay."
57:05;57:10;"It's maybe a little dated for our younger audience, but yeah, I'll go with it."
57:10;57:12;"Yeah, maybe more younger dancehall."
57:12;57:14;"Okay, one more."
57:14;57:16;"Yeah, the younger version of UB40, whatever that is."
57:16;57:17;"Right. So one more."
57:17;57:18;"Bieber."
57:18;57:20;"Oh, Bieber. Bieber got his--"
57:20;57:22;"Bieber is the younger version of UB40."
57:22;57:25;"We've been talking about it. He's had some Caribbean vibes in his music lately."
57:33;57:35;"Okay, so one more."
57:35;57:41;"You get summoned to Calabasas, California to come to the West Kardashian estate."
57:41;57:42;"All right."
57:42;57:46;"Kim and Kanye are both there sitting on thrones, and they each say--"
57:46;57:48;"We each individually want to do a brand partnership."
57:48;57:51;"What are you thinking for Kanye? What are you thinking for Kim?"
57:51;57:52;"Oh, wow."
57:52;57:55;"So Kanye, I'm going to go Funyuns."
58:10;58:12;"Funyuns? That's surprising."
58:12;58:14;"I'm going to go Funyuns. Yeah."
58:14;58:17;"And for Kim, I'm going to go Ruffles. I'm going to go Ruffles."
58:17;58:18;"Classic."
58:18;58:21;"Yeah, I was thinking about Ruffles. When you mentioned Ruffles before,"
58:21;58:25;"I kind of feel like obviously the name of the company, Frito-Lay,"
58:25;58:28;"as you're putting those two forward, Doritos is such a famous one."
58:28;58:32;"Ruffles, I feel like, might get a little lost in the sauce."
58:32;58:35;"So how do you see the connection between Kim Kardashian and Ruffles?"
58:35;58:38;"Ruffles, it's got a sense of boldness to it too,"
58:38;58:41;"but also a little bit of classic, a little bit of bold, both mixed together."
58:41;58:45;"One of the things that people love about it is it's got a lot of flavor,"
58:45;58:46;"and I think she's got a lot of flavor."
58:46;58:49;"She's got a lot of personality, so that's the connection for me."
59:05;59:06;"Yeah, that's true."
59:06;59:09;"I always, yeah, if I was at a party and they had a bowl of just classic lays"
59:09;59:12;"and classic Ruffles, I'm going Ruffles."
59:12;59:13;"Every time."
59:13;59:15;"Every time. It wouldn't even cross my mind."
59:15;59:17;"I see the texture."
59:17;59:20;"I'm a Ruffles guy, the more I think about it."
59:20;59:22;"And yet, I feel like I live in a lays world."
59:22;59:24;"You know, I feel like I'm around lays more."
59:24;59:25;"I'm just hanging out with the wrong people."
59:25;59:28;"I feel like lays is the biggest selling brand you have, right?"
59:28;59:29;"Is that right?"
59:29;59:32;"Lays is the number one food brand in the universe, basically."
59:32;59:33;"What?"
59:33;59:36;"So in the world, it's the number one food brand in the world."
59:36;59:37;"Oh, my God."
59:37;59:38;"Yeah."
59:38;59:39;"Where's lays big outside of the States?"
59:39;59:44;"Mexico is pretty big, but they call it Tabariza in Mexico."
59:44;59:48;"So it goes under different brands, but the trademark is all the same."
59:48;59:52;"It's the product itself, but it's Tabariza in Mexico."
59:52;59:54;"It's Walker's in the U.K."
59:54;59:55;"Oh, right."
59:55;01:00:00;"It's Wax in Australia, but it's all the same brand and business linked together."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"Wow, that's amazing."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"It's a big one."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"So we should talk a little bit about, first of all,"
01:00:05;01:00:09;"you've gotten some amazing shout-outs in your brief eight months."
01:00:09;01:00:14;"Forbes says that what Doritos has been doing lately is nothing short of,"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"well, marketing genius, and they talked about some of the ways the snack has"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"been grabbing consumers' attention this year,"
01:00:19;01:00:23;"and the big one was the kind of Doritos political tie-in that you guys"
01:00:23;01:00:28;"partnered with Rock the Vote to try to encourage younger people to go to the polls."
01:00:28;01:00:32;"Why did you choose Doritos to be paired with Rock the Vote, and were you nervous?"
01:00:32;01:00:37;"I know, obviously, Doritos is not coming out in favor of any political candidates,"
01:00:37;01:00:43;"I think, but it's unusual for a corporation to encourage civic engagement."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"It's interesting."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Yeah, so how did that--what was the thought process?"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"We're nonpartisan, but we certainly want people to engage,"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"engage in their world, engage in discussion."
01:00:52;01:00:57;"So the narrative on Doritos that we try to encourage people is there's nothing"
01:00:57;01:01:03;"bolder than being yourself, and part of being yourself is expressing yourself."
01:01:03;01:01:08;"And what we were trying to show people with the campaign, we refer to it as"
01:01:08;01:01:14;"No Choice, is that voting and registering to vote is really about expressing"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"and being part of a decision process."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"And what No Choice was is we installed vending machines in college campuses"
01:01:22;01:01:26;"and in partnership with Rock the Vote, and these vending machines would take you"
01:01:26;01:01:30;"through a touchscreen panel, you could select the chip that you were looking for,"
01:01:30;01:01:35;"whether it was nacho cheese or Cool Ranch, but the very first question that it"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"asked you was, ""Are you registered to vote?"""
01:01:37;01:01:40;"And if you answered no, you would still go through the touchpad panel,"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"select the flavor that you want, but instead of dispensing the chip that you chose,"
01:01:44;01:01:49;"you would get this gray bag of No Choice chips that was filled with cardboard"
01:01:49;01:01:54;"chips inside, nothing very tasty at all, because if you're not registered to vote,"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"you can't make a choice, just like in--"
01:01:56;01:02:01;"- So you literally created a metaphorical vending machine."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Yep."
01:02:02;01:02:06;"- And so the kids, presumably, maybe the word spread, but they didn't know it first,"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"so you'd say, ""I didn't register to vote."""
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- No, they didn't know it first."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"And they would do this."
01:02:09;01:02:13;"They would get the No chips, and they basically--to bring to life for them"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"that if you're not registered to vote, you can't make a choice,"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"someone else will choose for you, just like we did in that situation."
01:02:19;01:02:23;"- I love the concept, although I've got to say the first thing that I'm thinking of"
01:02:23;01:02:27;"as somebody who also has my own corporation and has been sued,"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"when I think about that, I imagine legal being like, ""We can't have some stoner"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"college kid eating the cardboard chips."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"That's a lawsuit."""
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Was there any fear about that?"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"- No one was harmed in the consumption of cardboard chips."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"They're not going to hurt you in any way."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"They're certainly not going to taste very good, but if anybody consumed the"
01:02:45;01:02:49;"cardboard chips, it would probably--they'd be all right from a consumption standpoint."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"But we would definitely encourage them to keep our field trips instead."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"- That sounds like a great campaign, and I love that you guys are encouraging"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"people to vote."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Thanks so much, Jennifer."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"This really has been fascinating, and thanks for taking the time to talk to us."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"And so everybody, Jennifer Sines, check her out."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"The company is called Frito-Lay's North America."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Look them up."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Check out the portfolio, and enjoy the Adele concert tonight, Jennifer."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"- Awesome. Thanks, guys. It was fun."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- Yeah, thanks so much. Have a good one."

01:06:59;01:07:01;"we've had on this show--"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"it used to be, like, the biggest guest"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"we ever had was Jamie Foxx. - Yeah."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"- He definitely just got bumped down to number two."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"- Big time. - I've never actually gotten"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"to talk that candidly with a chief marketing officer."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"- I don't think I've ever even spoken"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"to a chief marketing officer."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"- I guess, you know, like, there's marketing"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"in the music industry, but it's, like--"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"- Oh, okay. - It's so different."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"It's not like--there's not, like,"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"a chief marketing officer. You know, this was such"

01:07:29;01:07:31;"psychographics. Obviously, I've never heard"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"that phrase before. - Right."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"So as opposed to a demographic,"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"a psychographic is,"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"like she said, like a personality type?"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"- It's a personality type that-- - Like a skater or something."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"- Well, or just, you know, she threw out, like, optimistic."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"It's a mindset that transcends"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"race, age,"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"and gender. They don't want to limit"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"themselves and be like, ""Doritos are"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"for 14-year-olds."" - Right."

01:07:55;01:07:57;"14, 25,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"95."" - Right. - So that's"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"an interesting phrase. - She was a big fan"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"of the word ""bold."""
01:08:03;01:08:05;"- Specifically with regard to Doritos."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"- Yeah. I was trying to"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"find maybe a gentle way to sort of"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"push back on the use of the word"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"""bold"" to describe people that eat Doritos."

01:08:15;01:08:17;"- No, I don't agree. - What do you mean?"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"- A slightly--it was a generous"

01:08:23;01:08:25;"I know what you're saying, 'cause to you, being bold"

01:08:27;01:08:29;"Well, look, her job is that she works"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"in selling snack food, so-- - No, I get it."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"- You know, so, like, I guess she's not"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"saying--I'm sure Jennifer"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"would not say that it's, um,"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"more bold"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"to eat a bag of Doritos"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"than it is to protest"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"the pipeline in North Dakota."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"She's not taking it there. They gotta look for"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"correlations. - Right. She's saying"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"in the spectrum of snack food eating,"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"which is inherently"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"a not very bold"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"activity, she's saying--"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"- No, no, no, I'm not throwing shade here."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"I think we can all acknowledge that eating snack"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"foods-- - Is not a bold activity"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"on the spectrum of activities? - Right."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"But in that spectrum,"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"she would say that Doritos are a bold"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"choice. - And I would agree with that."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- So it's like, if you're gonna go"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"Grover Washington Jr. or"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Kenny G. in the spectrum"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"of smooth jazz, you're gonna go Grover."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"That's a bold choice. - Right. If you're gonna"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"listen to Kanye instead of Drake,"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"well, I guess you're gonna eat Funyuns."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"- Right. - Or maybe Doritos."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"The one other question that"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"I had is, personally,"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"and maybe this is just my own bias,"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"if I became CEO of Frito-Lay,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"the first thing I would change the name to"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"would be DoritoCore"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"of America."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Because, obviously, as she said,"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"they have a wide portfolio"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"of snack brands."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"By the way, I love the, like,"

01:09:51;01:09:53;"that by the time I"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"pass from this Earth, I also have a portfolio"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"of snack brands. Maybe not at the level of"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Frito-Lay, just like two or three."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"- Kind of like a Paul Newman thing, Newman's Own?"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"- Yeah, except the money wouldn't go to charity."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"- It would just go to you."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"- No, it would go direct-- no, yeah, no."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"It'd have to go to charity. Go directly to the"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"military-industrial complex. I would love"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"to have just three brands that I can leave to my"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"three children. The pita chips."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- Right. - I leave to my daughter,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Stacey. But anyway,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"I'm saying if I was the CEO of"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"Frito-Lay, there is something about, like,"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"I didn't know that Lay's was the"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"biggest brand in the world, but I just feel like Frito-Lay"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"it just sends this, like, old-fashioned"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"image of the company. I would want"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"one of my Vanguard bold brands,"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"such as Doritos, to be the face of"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"the company. - Right, flagship. - Yeah, exactly."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"So it's like, I wouldn't jettison"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Frito and Lay's,"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"but I would want the company to be like,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"""I work at DoritoCore."""
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Yeah. - DoritoCore"

01:10:49;01:10:51;"other brands, but it's DoritoCore."

01:10:53;01:10:55;"if Frito's is, you know,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"no longer a big seller, but it's still the name of the company."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"- Yeah, then it's time--"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"- Conceivable. - Then it's time to change to DoritoCore."

01:23:33;01:23:35;"and it's like, ""What?"""
01:23:35;01:23:37;"- Yeah."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"- Whereas Drake is dealing with something more complex."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"- Yeah."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"- There's no wrong side of the tracks anymore."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Sometimes the snakes are the people"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"you don't think they're gonna be."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"It's not necessarily the guy in the leather jacket"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"at the candy store."

01:23:55;01:23:57;"in the limo."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"- Yeah, it's your best friend from childhood"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"who's in your crew."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"- Right. But I guess that's an old concept."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Judas."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- Absolutely."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- The way that Judas did Jesus."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"- Et tu, Brutus?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"- Exactly."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"The way Brutus did Caesar."
01:24:17;01:24:39;"- So to anybody who's in Drake's crew,"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"I gotta get this off my chest."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"If you don't like the guy,"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"leave the crew."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"Am I crazy here?"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"If you don't like somebody,"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"don't be in their crew."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"- Be straight up."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"- If you don't like somebody,"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"and you see them at the club,"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"don't go straight up to their face"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"and give them fake love."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Go home. Ignore them."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"I'm not saying you have to be a d*** about it,"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"but I think Drake's in the right here."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Although, you know the question is,"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"does Drake show fake love to anybody?"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- Great question."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Everyone must at some point, right?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"- Sometimes showing fake love is just about being polite."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Jake, did you know that there's a rumor"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"that Drake and Taylor Swift are dating?"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"- I did know that because on Twitter,"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"this actually ties into Apple Music."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"One of my favorite music writers,"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"this guy Steven Heiden,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"he wrote a tweet that was like,"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"""Something to the effect of Drake"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"and Taylor Swift dating proves"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"that God is an Apple Music algorithm."""
01:25:39;01:25:41;"- That's very smart."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"I like that. - That was pretty funny."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- Sometimes people,"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"when celebrities start dating,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"they roll their eyes."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Drake and Taylor Swift, they're two operators, right?"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"- Yeah. - Just they choose who they're gonna date"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"based on almost algorithmic principles."
01:25:55;01:25:57;"What's gonna get me attention?"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"What's gonna get people talking?"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"But you know what?"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Everybody out there who's dating somebody who's married,"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"where did you meet that person?"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Who's your significant other?"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"Is it a guy or gal from Chennai, India?"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"Or is it somebody from your community?"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Somebody who lives nearby?"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Maybe works in a similar industry?"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Similar interests?"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"- 7-Eleven. - Yeah, maybe they work"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"at your local 7-Eleven."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Maybe you literally met them via an algorithm"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"on Tinder."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"- I don't think Heiden was throwing shade, really."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"- No, I don't think he's throwing shade,"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"but he's proving that, you know,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"we like to believe that love transcends"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"all these things, but sometimes you get down to it"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"and it's like, you know, people meet each other"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"who work in similar industries, who live in similar places,"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"who, uh..."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I have heard..."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"- No, it makes complete sense."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"- The only reason that it's a bad thing is that"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"I've heard that more than ever,"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"people from similar"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"socioeconomic backgrounds"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"are getting married."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Even though women are making more money"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"and attaining higher positions than they did,"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"say, in the 1950s,"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"men and women who both, say,"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"are at the executive level in a corporation,"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"they tend to marry each other,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"which is great."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"If you're a Frito-Lay executive and you're having pillow talk"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"with, you know, your partner,"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"you hope that they can follow when you're talking about"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"psychographics"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"and marketing and stuff."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"I get it, but at the same time,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"we're dealing with a period of extreme"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"wealth inequality."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"That money that you're making in the executive position,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"you're marrying somebody... - Who's working at Kraft."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"- Yeah."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Now, the conversation's going to be off the hook,"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"of course, and I can only imagine"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"being a child in that household."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"But it does contribute to wealth inequality."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"But you can't tell people to marry..."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"I don't know. I guess, you know what it is?"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"That's why we've got to just pay more taxes"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"so that the executives can marry each other,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"but they've still got to give money that's going to"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"help people who don't have the luxury of..."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"- And the pop power couples."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"- Yeah, man, Drake and Taylor Swift,"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"a lot of money."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Now, if they each married a broke person,"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"at least two broke people would be less broke."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"- Is it even true, or is it just a rumor?"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"We don't even know. - We don't even know."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Who cares?"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"We worry too much about celebrities anyway."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Celebrity worship is how"

01:29:05;01:29:07;"finds a significant other"

01:32:07;01:32:10;"Man, you are so good at listening to lyrics."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Yeah, I'm a professional lyricist."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"You really zone in on that immediately."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"I listen to them in a much more, like,"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"I don't know, like, spaced out kind of..."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"You know me, I love my sonic palettes."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Right."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"I've probably also heard..."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"I've heard this song probably more times than you."
01:32:26;01:32:28;"Yeah, this is only the second time I've heard it."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"So I'm just kind of listening to it in this kind of..."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"Right, you're taking it all in holistically."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Yeah, like, what are the dynamics and the feelings?"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"Yeah, 'cause sometimes you hear a song"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"and you take it all in, and then you're like,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"""Why don't I look up the lyrics?"""
01:32:40;01:32:42;"You're like, ""That's what it's about?"""
01:32:42;01:32:44;"And then you're like, ""Ooh, I can't listen to this anymore."""
01:32:44;01:32:46;"I was talking to my mom recently,"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"'cause she was never very interested in pop music."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Yeah."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Like, her record collection leans very heavy"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"on classical, a little bit of folk."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"But not particularly interested."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"You know, I guess I was talking about, like..."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"I was talking about the Bruce Springsteen book,"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"'cause I know my dad had a bunch of Bruce records,"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"and I was like, ""Mom, were you, like, a Springsteen fan?"""
01:33:04;01:33:06;"You know, just growing up in New Jersey, New York."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"Like, were you up on him?"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"And she was like, ""Eh, I just wasn't interested"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"in that type of music."""
01:33:12;01:33:14;"And she was going to check some of it out"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"to see if she'd be interested in the book,"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"and she was listening to some, like, Born in the USA,"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"and she was like, ""It's so noisy."""
01:33:20;01:33:22;"And I was like, ""Eh, not wrong about that."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"That, like, loud '80s... pfft, yeah."""
01:33:24;01:33:26;"But anyway, she said she was getting more interested"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"in pop music now, because the lyrics are easily accessible."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"She likes to know what she's listening to."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"So now, if, you know, there's a Chainsmokers song"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"on the radio, she can look up the lyrics immediately."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Whereas it's funny to think, back in the day,"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"if they didn't include the official lyrics with it,"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"you could sit there for hours wondering what it says."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"I think it's kind of cool that you can discuss"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"the meaning with other people very quickly."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"- Yeah. - And you can know exactly"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"what somebody's saying."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"- So is she getting into the Chainsmokers, or, like..."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"- No, I don't think the Chainsmokers..."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"She just finds music with lyrics more interesting"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"when she gets... I think because, you know,"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"she liked folk music, where the lyrics are mostly"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"what's there. - And the diction is very clear."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"- And the diction's very clear."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"So now you can, like..."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"A song like Bruno Mars, which is, like, so fun"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"and there's so much going on, but it can occasionally"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"be hard to know exactly what he's saying."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"Now you can look it up. - I feel like Bruce, though,"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"a lot of the songs, you can follow it."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"Maybe... I don't know. Maybe it's hard."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"- (imitates Bruce's scream) - Yeah, I mean, ""Born in the USA"""
01:34:18;01:34:20;"is a tough one. - (imitates Bruce's scream)"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"- ""Burned in a dead man's tent!"" Yeah."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"- Obviously, Ronald Reagan didn't know what he was saying."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Let's go back to 1964. This is pretty wild,"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"that on the same time that ""Leader of the Pack"""
01:34:28;01:34:30;"was on the charts, also about this kind of, like,"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"disastrous, dangerous,"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"auto-vehicular romance,"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"this song was also on the charts."
01:34:36;01:34:38;"J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers."
01:34:40;01:34:44;"- Oh, this is another car accident one, right?"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"- Yeah."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"- ♪ Well, where, oh, where can my baby be? ♪"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"- Whoa, this song's, like,"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"kind of, like, punky in a way."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"It's like... (imitates drumming)"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"- Yeah."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"Yeah, it's, like, really up-tempo."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"- I listened to this song a lot as a kid."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"I had, like, a tape of, like, the greatest hits of 1964."

01:35:12;01:35:14;"for ""Springsteen,"" too. - Oh, yeah."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"- Like, that song... - The big drama of..."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"- That song, um, ""Wreck on the Highway,"""

01:35:28;01:35:30;"- Yeah. - It was, like, all over the radio."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"I remember thinking that was so random."

01:35:54;01:35:56;"You know what's funny? That's such a '60s sentiment."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"The chorus of the song is,"

01:36:22;01:36:25;"The number two song on the charts in 1964"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"was about a guy gets in a car accident."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"It sounds like it's kind of his fault."

01:36:38;01:36:42;"My main takeaway from this experience is that--"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"- I got to be good. - Is that I got to be good."
01:36:44;01:36:47;"This definitely reaffirms my faith."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"[laughs]"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"I mean, shout-out to that guy,"
01:36:51;01:36:55;"'cause a lot of people would stop believing in God"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"after being in a traumatic incident like that."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"- A completely senseless way to die, yeah."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"- I mean, I could see both sides of it."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Or maybe you need God more than ever."
01:37:04;01:37:08;"But anyway, you don't hear that in pop songs that much these days."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"If something bad happened to you,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"you'd probably write a song about stewing"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"in the depression that followed,"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"versus this guy has a relatively upbeat attitude"
01:37:17;01:37:24;"for having killed his girlfriend in vehicular manslaughter."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Wow."
01:37:26;01:37:29;"November '64, major election coming up."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"JFK had just died, right?"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"- Yeah, a year prior."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"- Yeah, a year prior, JFK died."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"The president of the United States was murdered."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"And then two of the songs on the charts--"
01:37:39;01:37:43;"one from a female perspective, one from a male perspective--"
01:37:43;01:37:46;"about a significant other dying."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"- Tragically and suddenly."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"- You know what's really crazy about that song?"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"I mean, I love that song. I do find it moving."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"And also, it's just describing a real thing."
01:37:54;01:37:57;"Like, it seems so dramatic, like the rain pouring down."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"But you know what?"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"It's like people die in car accidents every day."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"It's horrific."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"- $35,000 a year, dude. - Oh, God."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Yeah, just think about how many people's lives that ruins"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"like a significant other dying in a car accident."
01:38:07;01:38:11;"And so I don't want to take away from the deep emotion of the song."
01:38:11;01:38:15;"The only thing that I find weird is that the girl smiles."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"- Yeah, that's very weird. - It's kind of like--"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"I guess that's supposed to illustrate just the intensity of their love."
01:38:21;01:38:25;"Even though she's dying, she's in his arms, and she's--"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"- Oh, that's a nice way to think about it."
01:38:27;01:38:31;"- You know, it's-- she can't help but smile, even though the end is near."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"- If a double-decker bus crashes into us,"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"- That song really maybe launched a lot of other songs."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"- Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"- And obviously that Springsteen song I was talking about."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"- Yeah. - But in the Bruce song, it's the--"
01:38:43;01:38:46;"- He sees a wreck on the highway. - He sees a wreck."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"He stops. There's a young man dying."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"- Yeah. - He witnesses this man's death."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"And then he goes home-- - And looks at his child."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"- No, his wife. - Oh, his wife."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"- Yeah, he goes back, and he, like, gets into bed with his wife."
01:38:56;01:38:59;"And he just watches her sleeping in peace."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"- Oh, God."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"- And he's just sort of, like, recognizing that, like, life is finite."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"- Ooh. - Bruce took it to some other place."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"- Yeah, car accidents. Ugh, man."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"- Yeah, no, I like your interpretation that the smile was,"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"""I know I'm going to die. This is a bad way to die."""
01:39:15;01:39:18;"I guess if Morrissey was writing this song, it would be,"
01:39:18;01:39:23;"""If my boyfriend's poor driving results in a car crash,"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"to die in his arms is a heavenly way to die."""
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Eh, well, maybe it wasn't his fault."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"I don't want to pin it on him."
01:39:30;01:39:34;"Yeah, I thought maybe the smile was more in, like, the kind of--"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"the religious sentiment of the song."
01:39:36;01:39:41;"Just like, ""Oh, don't worry about me. I'm going to a better place."""
01:39:41;01:39:44;"Smiling while dying."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"Oh, man. Emotional."
01:39:47;01:39:51;"The 2016 equivalent, ""Number 2"" on iTunes,"
01:39:51;01:39:55;"is also kind of a dark song, but with a different sentiment."

01:42:08;01:42:11;"I know. That's what made it so much weirder."
01:42:11;01:42:12;"Of all the oldies."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"I mean, it's a great song."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"It just was like..."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"That's the answer, man."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"It's a great song."
01:42:17;01:42:21;"Re-contextualized by Eddie Vedder and the Pearl Jam crew."
01:42:21;01:42:27;"The number one song this week in 1964 was by The Supremes."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Oh."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Is this Phil Spector?"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"No, no, no."
01:42:32;01:42:35;"This is Motown, yeah."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"This is The Stomps."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"What's that sound?"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Is that claps and stomps?"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"No, it sounds like a really reverb-y, wooden..."
01:42:44;01:42:47;"I don't know what it is."
01:42:47;01:42:49;"Some sort of like two pieces of wood slapping together"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"in a really reverb-y room."
01:42:51;01:43:03;"I mean, great song."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"I love it."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"Beautiful song."
01:43:05;01:43:06;"I love Diana Ross and The Supremes."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"You know, Diana Ross..."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"You know how it's like, the best of the best singers,"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"their voices are a little strange."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"Yeah."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"And their delivery's a little strange."
01:43:17;01:43:20;"Diana Ross reminds me of Rihanna in a little way."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"There's this casualness to the delivery."
01:43:22;01:43:25;"And their voices both are kind of like..."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"thin."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"There's something mystical about..."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"I agree."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"I was always captivated by Diana Ross."
01:43:31;01:43:35;"But then it was slightly re-contextualized for me"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"when I saw the film Dreamgirls."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"Oh, right."
01:43:38;01:43:43;"Where there's the character sort of based loosely on Diana Ross."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"And then the thesis of the film is that"
01:43:45;01:43:49;"they chose her to sing because it appealed more to white people."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"It was like, it was sort of..."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"What?"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"You remember this in the movie?"
01:43:52;01:43:55;"The Jennifer Hudson character was more like"
01:43:55;01:43:59;"a traditional black voice, like soulful, bluesy."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"And then I think it was the character played by Beyoncé."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Right?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Was that who was in that movie?"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"It was like the sort of Diana Ross-style character."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Oh, and like Jennifer Hudson was like Mary Wells?"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"Yeah, or something."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Or just someone you haven't heard of."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"Right."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"And it was put forward very explicitly in the film."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"I remember feeling like, sort of like, oh..."
01:44:18;01:44:21;"The film was implying that the Beyoncé character"
01:44:21;01:44:24;"made the face of the group because how she looked"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"appealed more to white people?"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"No, the sound of her voice."
01:44:27;01:44:28;"The sound of her voice appealed more to white people."
01:44:28;01:44:32;"It was less like explicitly of a black voice."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Which, and I felt like that was in a way"
01:44:34;01:44:38;"sort of referring to Diana Ross' voice."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"Which I think is a great voice, mystical like you said."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"Right."
01:44:41;01:44:43;"But I never thought about that before"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"until I saw that movie and I was like,"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"wow, I wonder if people thought that."
01:44:46;01:44:47;"I wonder if people..."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Is that rooted in some truth about the behind the scenes"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"of The Supremes?"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"I don't know."
01:44:51;01:44:53;"I never looked into it, but I was sort of like,"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"well, that's interesting."
01:44:54;01:44:55;"I'm not familiar."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Supremes, great group."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Yeah."
01:44:58;01:45:01;"Early Supremes, 1964."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Baby Love."
01:45:03;01:45:06;"Have you ever called anybody Baby Love before?"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"No."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"Have you?"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"I've called people Baby."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"I'm not big into Baby."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"Really?"
01:45:12;01:45:13;"With like a girlfriend."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Honey, sweetie."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Honey."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"Baby?"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"All right, so I'm your girlfriend calling up."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"Bring, bring."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"No, no, it wouldn't be on the phone."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"Okay."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"Yeah."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"Hi, honey."
01:45:24;01:45:27;"Honey is like a '70s businessman."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"That sounds like some weird Don Draper thing."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Hi, honey."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"No, just say like..."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Honey, I'm swamped."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Yeah, honey seems like harsh."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"Whereas, pick up the phone, bring, bring, bring."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Oh, hey, baby."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"It's a little smoother."
01:45:42;01:45:46;"Well, with the phone, it's more of like you know who's calling, so you're just like, ""What's"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"up?"""
01:45:47;01:45:49;"It's very unromantic."
01:45:49;01:45:52;"It's your girlfriend calling you."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"What's up?"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"No, no, no, no."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"It's like more of a..."
01:45:55;01:45:56;"It's a Budweiser ad."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"It's a more tender what's up."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"So, you'll answer the phone..."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"What's up?"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"You'll be like, ""Hey, baby."""
01:46:02;01:46:04;"If a significant other is calling me, yeah, of course."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"Hi, baby."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Hey, baby."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"I don't..."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"I don't know."
01:46:08;01:46:11;"Now, actually, it sounds uncomfortable in this context."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Yeah, it does."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"What are the other good..."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"You know, it's interesting."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"I think America..."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"No, not America."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"English has a lot more options."
01:46:18;01:46:22;"Because I'm going to talk to people from other countries where there is..."
01:46:22;01:46:26;"In English, we'll call significant others almost anything."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Animals, sweet things."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"You know, it was seasonally appropriate, pumpkin."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Right."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"You ever call your girl pumpkin?"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"No."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Have you?"
01:46:36;01:46:37;"Hey there, pumpkin."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"You've done it."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"Yeah, I've done it."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"I know that pumpkin's like a funny one."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"Pumpkin's--that's pushing it."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Baby feels very neutral to me."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"You can say it."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"You can sing it."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"I know it's a little bit weird when you think about what a baby actually is, but..."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Yeah, that one's never appealed to me."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"To me, that's like the most all-American neutral one."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"Hey, baby."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Hello, baby."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"Honey pie."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Sugar pie honey bunch."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"Sugar pie honey bunch."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"I'm weaker than a man should be."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"I can't help myself."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"You're calling your girl sugar pie honey bunch."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Wait, what's the second line?"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"I'm weaker than a man should be."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"Oh, wow."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"That's a weird sound."
01:47:18;01:47:23;"See, I've heard that song my entire life, and I never knew it was I'm weaker than a man should be."
01:47:23;01:47:28;"It's a song about male fragility."
01:47:28;01:47:30;"I can't help myself."
01:47:30;01:47:35;"I love you and nobody else."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Four Tops."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Great group."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Are you a Four Tops guy or a Temptations guy?"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Big time."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"I love them both."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"Massive rivalry."
01:47:44;01:47:48;"Bernadette."
01:47:48;01:47:55;"The number one song, ""The Baby Love of 2016,"" is our good friends the Chainsmokers with ""Closer"" featuring Halsey."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"I don't even want to talk about this song."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"No, I have a theory, though."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Yeah."
01:47:59;01:48:12;"The reason that maybe this song stays number one for so long is that when you open up iTunes, it has, like, the hottest hits of the day or whatever, most downloaded, right there."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"And so it sort of becomes like a self-perpetuating cycle."
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Yeah, that's true about most popular things."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"I guess so."
01:48:19;01:48:23;"Once something gets popular enough, then people start talking about it, writing about it because it's so popular."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"But what I'm saying, it's like, just click."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"It's right there."
01:48:28;01:48:35;"It's not like you actively have to go to the record store and be like, ""Oh, I'm hearing this new Billy Joel record is great."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"I'm going to go make a choice to buy this."""
01:48:37;01:48:39;"It's sort of like you open up your iTunes window."
01:48:39;01:48:44;"It's like, ""Oh, every time I open the window up, Chainsmokers is right there."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"They've been there for weeks."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"I'm going to finally break down."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"It's lunch hour on a Thursday."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Click."""
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Now is a great time to make big, fat pop hits."
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Winner take all."
01:48:56;01:49:00;"It's really a great time to be making album-oriented rock."
01:49:00;01:49:03;"But yeah, whatever, good for them."
01:49:26;01:49:32;"The Chainsmokers, I think I told you last time they got in some beef with Lady Gaga."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"Right."
01:49:33;01:49:36;"Friend of the show, Mark Ronson, weighed in."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"Oh, really?"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"Yeah, he dropped a tweet the other day."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"I'm not going to look it up."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I can vaguely recall from memory."
01:49:41;01:49:46;"It was something the Chainsmokers said, ""Now back to business,"" or something."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"And then he responded to that by being like, ""Oh, what do you mean?"
01:49:48;01:49:53;"Back to being the kings of vacuous, two-bar Ableton loops?"""
01:49:53;01:49:58;"And then the real shade was he was like, ""We'll see where you are in the future."""
01:49:58;01:50:03;"And then he sent them a link to seven good ways to save your money,"
01:50:03;01:50:07;"essentially implying that you guys are on top right now,"
01:50:07;01:50:10;"but I believe that your music does not have staying power."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"It's vacuous."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"It's not interesting."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"This is coming from Mark Ronson."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"You didn't even know who this guy was two weeks ago,"
01:50:20;01:50:24;"but he's a friend of Time Crisis, so you cannot slander him."
01:50:24;01:50:27;"And he was saying, ""Good luck."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"I need you to go invest your money in a mutual fund."""
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Wow, he went in."
01:50:32;01:50:36;"Yeah, you can take all that closer featuring Halsey money"
01:50:36;01:50:42;"and invest it and put it in a 401(k), you stupid piece of [expletive]"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"I've got to give it up for Mark."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"Mark's a very laid-back guy, but--"
01:50:44;01:50:45;"That's interesting."
01:50:45;01:50:48;"I mean, he was defending the artists that he worked with."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Oh, Gaga, okay."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Yeah, because he produced that album."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Okay, okay."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"I mean, whichever side you take in it, at least he's loyal."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"That's cool, man."
01:50:57;01:50:58;"I like people having opinions."
01:50:58;01:50:59;"He had opinions."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"Well, I guess it all started, though, because they had an opinion that the song was bad."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"Someone sent us a tweet."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"Did you see that?"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"The video of the Chainsmokers responding to the criticism"
01:51:08;01:51:11;"that their new single sounds exactly like the last one."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Oh, but it was a fake one."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"Oh, was it?"
01:51:13;01:51:14;"Oh, you thought that was real?"
01:51:14;01:51:15;"What was it?"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"No, that was like two comedians pretending to be the Chainsmokers."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"Oh, because I was like, ""That's what they look like?"""
01:51:19;01:51:20;"I totally thought it was real."
01:51:20;01:51:21;"Oh, that's hilarious."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"For context, this is like two comedians made a video"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"that was them pretending to be the Chainsmokers."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"It was like, ""Hey, a lot of people have been wondering"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"why our new single sounds exactly like the old single."""
01:51:28;01:51:31;"Well, the truth is, we did it for money,"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"and they're both ripping off a Fetty Wap song."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"See, that made me actually like them a lot more,"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"because I thought it was real."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"I can't believe I thought that was real."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"What is wrong with me?"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"You're just out of touch with 2016, man."
01:51:43;01:51:44;"I'm gullible, dude."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"We should give them on sometime."
01:51:46;01:51:47;"Chainsmokers?"
01:51:47;01:51:50;"I want to hear their side of the story, because obviously,"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"I like Gaga."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"I like Mark."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"I like them."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"They're both good people."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"I hate to see them getting dissed."
01:51:56;01:52:00;"But as Deezus says, got to hear both sides."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"So, '64 versus 2016."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"'64 had a lot more pathos."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"'64 crushed it."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"'64 killed it."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"Normally, I don't feel strongly one way or the other,"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"but '64, man, ""Let It Be Me,"" ""Leader of the Pack,"""
01:52:13;01:52:16;"""Do I Diddy,"" ""Last Kiss,"" ""Baby Love,"" that's strong."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"This year, you know, I like-- all the songs are fine,"
01:52:19;01:52:22;"but those songs really gave me a feeling."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"These songs are cool."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"They're a little all over the place."
01:52:25;01:52:29;"But 2016's still a better year than 1964."

01:52:49;01:52:50;"Yeah, Bruce Hornsby, all right, yeah."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"That's just the way it is."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"To give those who ain't got a little more."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"Should we close the show out with--"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"I think we should close the show out with that,"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"so it's just the way it is."

01:52:58;01:53:00;"And you want to hear the Bruce Hornsby version"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"off the Tupac version?"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"Yeah."
