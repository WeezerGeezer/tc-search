00:00;00:07;"Time crisis returns, and this time, we've got Olympics fever,"
00:07;00:11;"as the Olympics rage down in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
00:11;00:16;"Jake and I talk about the effect it has on the American psyche."
00:16;00:20;"We also highlight other aspects of health and fitness."
00:20;00:24;"We revisit the music of 1984."
00:24;00:28;"We'll hear a lot of great tracks from the Olympic host country, Brazil."
00:28;00:30;"This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:34;00:38;"B-B-B-B-Beasts 1."
00:38;00:43;"Goodbye, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:47;"They were a threat to our belief"
00:47;00:50;"All my rightful chances"
00:50;00:53;"My picture clear"
00:53;00:58;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow"
01:01;01:05;"When the bus had to go"
01:05;01:09;"How it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is crying"
01:12;01:15;"One of us is lying"
01:15;01:20;"Even only there"
01:20;01:25;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:25;01:29;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:29;01:31;"-Hm, hear that, Jake? -Yep."
01:31;01:33;"I'm eating some Cracker Jacks."
01:33;01:35;"-Not Doritos? -Not Doritos."
01:35;01:38;"Because I feel like in the past few shows,"
01:38;01:42;"I really hit a wall around the 90-minute mark."
01:42;01:45;"And I need to eat some Doritos, but I want to start off with some Cracker Jacks."
01:45;01:47;"And also just had an idea."
01:47;01:50;"We knew we were going to talk about the Olympics on Today's Time Crisis"
01:50;01:54;"because the Olympics are going on, everybody's got Olympics fever."
01:54;01:56;"I think we should make the entire show about sports."
01:56;01:58;"-Great. -So this is a sports show."
01:58;02:02;"-Okay. -For me, I include sports, health, and fitness."
02:02;02:04;"-Sure. -You just went camping."
02:04;02:06;"-That's right. -Is that considered a sport?"
02:06;02:09;"-No. -What is it? An activity?"
02:09;02:11;"Yeah, it's a leisure activity."
02:11;02:13;"-Hiking is a sport. -Yeah."
02:13;02:15;"-It's athletic, it's not a sport. -Yeah, whatever, it's health and fitness."
02:15;02:17;"-Okay. -I've always been curious about this"
02:17;02:20;"because as long as I've known you, you've really been into the great outdoors."
02:20;02:21;"Uh-huh."
02:21;02:24;"And I've been mocked mercilessly."
02:24;02:27;"I've always had friends who were more into the great outdoors than me."
02:27;02:30;"-Yeah. -Even going back to childhood."
02:30;02:34;"I remember my friend Andre, growing up, his family was also really into camping."
02:34;02:38;"And any time I would end up in the wilderness with him, I'd always complain a lot."
02:38;02:40;"And he would always call me a suburban slicker."
02:40;02:43;"-Yep. -My dad supposedly doesn't even know how to swim."
02:43;02:46;"-Whoa. -Not a very outdoorsy family."
02:46;02:49;"So I've always felt a little disconnected from the great outdoors."
02:49;02:53;"So for listeners like me who maybe have never been to the woods,"
02:53;02:57;"don't enjoy the majesty of nature, what's it all about?"
02:57;03:01;"It's dealing with hardship in order to get a reward."
03:01;03:06;"And so if you have to hike for eight miles with a lot of weight on your back,"
03:06;03:10;"and then you finally get to the awesome spot that isn't accessible by car,"
03:10;03:15;"you make a campfire, you're with your friends, everything is just heightened."
03:15;03:19;"Right, so because you're getting that Instagram picture that nobody else got."
03:19;03:22;"Well, in this day, that is an added bonus. You're not wrong."
03:22;03:24;"Right, because everybody and their mother comes to LA"
03:24;03:27;"and stands in front of the streetlights in front of LACMA."
03:27;03:30;"But you're going three to four hours out of your way"
03:30;03:34;"to some weird clearing up a mountain, and then when you geotag it,"
03:34;03:36;"you're going to be one of the only pictures."
03:36;03:38;"I think this is a very cynical way to look at it."
03:38;03:40;"[laughter]"
03:40;03:43;"I think people that really enjoy hiking and camping"
03:43;03:46;"find that there is some sort of internal--"
03:46;03:49;"I almost want to say spiritual reward--"
03:49;03:51;"-You can say it. ---that comes with it."
03:51;03:53;"I think this has been getting more and more spiritual."
03:53;03:55;"It's a spiritual safe space."
03:55;03:58;"You could travel to a foreign city and experience something"
03:58;04:02;"completely other than yourself, or you could go in the middle of nowhere"
04:02;04:06;"and spend a day by yourself in the desert around no one"
04:06;04:08;"and find some other perspective."
04:08;04:13;"I totally understand the concept of putting yourself through hardship for reward."
04:13;04:18;"But there's got to be something, because every day here in LA,"
04:18;04:23;"you've got people who are just--they don't want to pound out the last ten reps,"
04:23;04:26;"and their trainer says, ""Do it,"" and they just pound through."
04:26;04:28;"They feel amazing afterwards."
04:28;04:31;"They're sweating, experiencing physical pain."
04:31;04:34;"They want to quit. Trainer won't let them."
04:34;04:37;"And then at the end, they get that endorphin rush of,"
04:37;04:40;"""I just completed a crazy hour-long workout."""
04:40;04:43;"So my question is--but of course, that's probably going to be happening"
04:43;04:47;"at an Equinox, so is it just the setting thing?"
04:47;04:52;"I think you're putting it into too narrow a lens of achievement"
04:52;04:54;"and these capitalistic terms."
04:54;04:56;"Pshh, man."
04:56;05:01;"It's more open and vague. It's about the journey, not the destination."
05:01;05:03;"Sometimes you go camping, and it sucks."
05:03;05:05;"I went two years ago with my brother."
05:05;05:08;"We met our parents up at 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada."
05:08;05:13;"Incredible spot, but it was a weird day or two, and it was really cold at night."
05:13;05:15;"It was down into the 20s."
05:15;05:18;"We didn't pack quite right for those conditions,"
05:18;05:20;"and then the next day it started pouring rain."
05:20;05:21;"Oh, God."
05:21;05:25;"And so it was like 40 degrees at 8.30 in the morning, and it's pouring,"
05:25;05:27;"and we're wet, and we're trying to make coffee."
05:27;05:30;"And we were like, ""Yeah, this kind of sucks."""
05:30;05:32;"It makes it for a good story later on--"
05:32;05:33;"At the time, it sucked."
05:33;05:36;"--to kind of reminisce with your family later in the year,"
05:36;05:40;"but it could have gone the other way too, where it was just perfect conditions."
05:40;05:42;"Like this last week when I was out, it was great."
05:42;05:44;"The weather was beautiful."
05:44;05:48;"If you're walking eight miles out in a state park,"
05:48;05:51;"are you talking to the people you're with?"
05:51;05:53;"You've never done this?"
05:53;05:54;"I'm going to take you out."
05:54;05:56;"Dude, I'm going to take you out."
05:56;05:58;"I mean, I went hiking with you in Griffith Park."
05:58;06:00;"That's not hiking, dude."
06:00;06:04;"In fact, we're going to do an off-mic time crisis."
06:04;06:07;"Out in Joshua Tree or wherever you want to go."
06:07;06:12;"If a time crisis happens in Joshua Tree with no recording equipment, did it happen?"
06:12;06:13;"No, it didn't."
06:13;06:14;"Did you post a picture of the Instagram?"
06:14;06:17;"No, but seriously, you're hiking, say, with a couple people."
06:17;06:18;"Yeah."
06:18;06:19;"Are you talking?"
06:19;06:20;"Sometimes."
06:20;06:23;"Is it considered rude to put in earbuds and cranks for tunes?"
06:23;06:25;"That would be weird."
06:25;06:26;"Why?"
06:26;06:30;"You're just throwing on like Bee Gees' ""Greatest Hits."""
06:30;06:31;"Okay, here's a question."
06:31;06:32;"That's a little tacky."
06:32;06:35;"I mean, you could pull it off, but it'd be a little like slightly alienating."
06:35;06:40;"Now that everybody has these like Bluetooth little speaker boxes,"
06:40;06:46;"jam boxes or whatever, do you find more that you'll see some people coming down the trail"
06:46;06:50;"and they're just like blasting some tunes from their rucksack?"
06:50;06:51;"You'll see that."
06:51;06:53;"Okay, so it's more considered rude with the earbuds."
06:53;06:57;"I mean, if I passed someone I didn't know with the earbuds, it wouldn't bum me out."
06:57;07:00;"But if I was out with my brother or my girlfriend or something"
07:00;07:03;"and they just like popped in earbuds and were like, ""Peace,"""
07:03;07:05;"that'd be kind of weird."
07:05;07:07;"Not as weird as if somebody did that at like a dinner."
07:07;07:10;"True. Not as weird, but borderline."
07:10;07:14;"I'm just saying because at dinner you're like facing each other."
07:14;07:15;"Sometimes--"
07:15;07:17;"Walking is a very specific head space."
07:17;07:18;"You know what I mean?"
07:18;07:22;"Sometimes great conversations can be facilitated through walking."
07:58;08:13;"Thanks for talking to us about camping."
08:13;08:16;"Let's move more into what are considered true sports."
08:16;08:17;"Yeah."
08:17;08:21;"I did say with an asterisk, this is sports, parentheses health and fitness,"
08:21;08:23;"so that definitely falls under health and fitness."
08:23;08:25;"You can imagine a doctor being like, ""You should hike more."""
08:25;08:26;"Right. Oh, yeah. Sure."
08:26;08:29;"Get those steps in, getting the outdoors."
08:29;08:31;"So everybody has Olympics fever."
08:31;08:33;"So since you've been off the grid a little bit--"
08:33;08:34;"Very."
08:34;08:37;"--up in the Sierra Nevadas, what was the talk of the trail?"
08:37;08:39;"Was there Olympics talk on the trail?"
08:39;08:40;"Zero."
08:40;08:41;"Zero?"
08:41;08:42;"Yep."
08:42;08:43;"Just because phone service was so bad,"
08:43;08:45;"people just didn't even know what was happening in the Olympics?"
08:45;08:48;"People knew it was happening, but it just didn't come up."
08:48;08:49;"That seems like perfect trail talk."
08:49;08:50;"What? Okay."
08:50;08:55;"Reenact for me what you think Olympic trail talk would be."
08:55;08:57;"Hey, Jake, you know the Olympics are going on now?"
08:57;08:58;"Yeah, I heard that."
08:58;08:59;"Where are they this year?"
08:59;09:00;"Rio?"
09:00;09:02;"That's right. What country is Rio in?"
09:02;09:03;"I think Brazil."
09:03;09:04;"Interesting."
09:04;09:09;"What events are you excited to view or find out about?"
09:09;09:11;"Honestly, none of them."
09:11;09:12;"Really?"
09:12;09:13;"Yeah."
09:13;09:14;"Let's just take this conversation back into real life."
09:14;09:16;"Do you know who Michael Phelps is?"
09:16;09:17;"Yeah, he's a swimmer, smokes weed."
09:17;09:18;"That's right."
09:18;09:22;"He's won more gold medals than anyone in history."
09:22;09:23;"Really? I did not know that."
09:23;09:24;"Yeah."
09:24;09:25;"That's cool."
09:25;09:27;"Yeah, it's because you were up in the Sierra Nevadas."
09:27;09:29;"So he's killing it this summer?"
09:29;09:32;"Yeah, I think he broke the record at this current Olympics."
09:32;09:34;"For gold medals or for a time of some event?"
09:34;09:36;"Maybe both, but specifically medals."
09:36;09:37;"Okay."
09:37;09:40;"I felt like this Olympics really had a dark cloud hanging over it."
09:40;09:41;"Yep."
09:41;09:42;"I mean, this is good trail talk."
09:42;09:44;"I'm just saying, just to loop back."
09:44;09:46;"Yeah, let's just pretend we're hiking."
09:46;09:47;"Yeah."
09:47;09:50;"This Olympics really had a dark cloud hanging over it, man."
09:50;09:57;"From Zika to the socioeconomic implications of where they built the stadiums."
09:57;09:58;"Russian doping scandal."
09:58;10:00;"Russian doping scandal."
10:00;10:03;"The coverage on this Olympics has been very negative."
10:03;10:04;"You know what's funny, though?"
10:04;10:06;"This is like the pessimistic view."
10:06;10:12;"It's always been kind of like a conspiracy theory that the Illuminati or whatever you want to call them,"
10:12;10:15;"you know, like the old phrase, ""Religion is the opiate of the masses,"""
10:15;10:21;"that sports is used in a similar way to kind of stir patriotism in us"
10:21;10:23;"or make us forget about other things going on."
10:23;10:26;"And it really seemed like with this Olympics, people were talking so negatively about it."
10:26;10:29;"I was like, ""Man, people are not going to be into this Olympics."""
10:29;10:33;"But then once it starts, people do get kind of into it, and they get psyched that America wins."
10:33;10:34;"They do?"
10:34;10:35;"Yeah."
10:35;10:36;"Are you?"
10:36;10:38;"You know, I haven't watched that much of it."
10:38;10:40;"It's a weird one."
10:40;10:43;"I guess I felt good when Michael Phelps won."
10:43;10:44;"You felt good?"
10:44;10:46;"Made my day."
10:46;10:47;"No, it didn't."
10:47;10:50;"You didn't think about it 40 seconds after the event happened."
10:50;10:52;"Well, you know what's also funny?"
10:52;10:55;"With other sports, you need to grow up watching them to understand them."
10:55;10:58;"In the Olympics, they show like a three-minute explainer"
10:58;11:02;"that gives you some of the backstage drama, and suddenly you're in."
11:02;11:04;"It's like they have three minutes to make you care about swimming."
11:04;11:05;"Right, right, right."
11:05;11:10;"I was watching it, and there's a South African guy named LeClo."
11:10;11:16;"I forget what his first name is, but basically he was like Michael Phelps' main rival."
11:16;11:19;"And at some point in the past few years, Michael Phelps had said,"
11:19;11:22;"""Oh, yeah, I watched the young crop compete in the butterfly."
11:22;11:25;"They're all pretty slow, and this guy's really offended."""
11:25;11:28;"And then he said something like, ""Get back in the pool. I'll whoop your ass."""
11:28;11:31;"And Michael Phelps was like, ""I'm in."""
11:31;11:34;"And they kept showing this footage of them in the green room, getting ready."
11:34;11:35;"Holding chairs?"
11:35;11:40;"Yeah, and Phelps has this hood on, just like, ""Earbuds in. Earbuds firmly in."""
11:40;11:41;"Like a boxer."
11:41;11:44;"Yeah, definitely probably playing M&M, getting in the game."
11:44;11:47;"And then this guy's standing up, almost like showboating."
11:47;11:49;"And then they get in the pool."
11:49;11:55;"By that point, NBC Sports has kind of made you want Michael Phelps to win."
11:55;11:56;"Right."
11:56;11:59;"Also, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just like pure xenophobia."
11:59;12:01;"You hear this guy with the South African accent"
12:01;12:05;"talking to one of the greatest swimmers of all time."
12:05;12:08;"And this is probably his last Olympics. You want to see him beat him."
12:08;12:11;"So I guess when he won, I was kind of like, ""Nice."""
12:11;12:14;"To me, think about when the Olympics started."
12:14;12:19;"It was a really novel concept to get all these countries from around the world,"
12:19;12:22;"from these disparate cultures, to get together to compete."
12:22;12:26;"But now it's like a cliche that we live in this globalized world."
12:26;12:29;"Travel and technology is so easy."
12:29;12:30;"Yeah."
12:30;12:35;"It doesn't have the same profound resonance that I think it might have at one point."
12:35;12:39;"And to me, it's sort of like, ""All right, yeah, these countries are getting together to compete."
12:39;12:44;"Maybe someone's going to shave a fraction of a second off the world record."""
12:44;12:48;"Are the athletes today that break the records fundamentally better athletes"
12:48;12:50;"than the athletes of the past?"
12:50;12:51;"I don't think so."
12:51;12:56;"I think they're probably more just like vessels of whatever nutrition and technological advances"
12:56;12:59;"are happening in training in their era."
12:59;13:01;"It's hard to get excited about it for me."
13:01;13:03;"It's not a compelling human narrative."
13:03;13:06;"You live in 2016. You have a badass trainer."
13:06;13:09;"You have the grim determination that all these other athletes have,"
13:09;13:12;"or the same grim determination that athletes had 80 years ago."
13:12;13:16;"But you just have--you're drinking kale shakes, taking crazy vitamins."
13:16;13:19;"You have weird metrics that are measuring your blood and heart."
13:19;13:24;"It's just like sports are merging with science in a way that is not interesting to me."
13:24;13:27;"I know what you meant. There was a turning point."
13:27;13:30;"I used to think back in the day the early Olympic athletes,"
13:30;13:31;"they had no idea what they were doing."
13:31;13:33;"I guess they had trainers and stuff."
13:33;13:35;"It was like chariots of fire. These guys would run around on the beach."
13:35;13:37;"A lot of athletes wore sweaters."
13:37;13:39;"They didn't even have special clothes or anything."
13:39;13:41;"And every now and then there's a charismatic story"
13:41;13:44;"or a charismatic athlete with a compelling back story."
13:44;13:46;"You always got to root for the hard knock story."
13:46;13:48;"Yeah, like the refugee team."
13:48;13:50;"You know what's a crazy Olympics?"
13:50;13:54;"I caught just the tail end of a story about it on the radio this morning."
13:54;14:00;"The '36 one, which was the Nazi one, when Hitler had just taken power."
14:00;14:02;"And you wouldn't shake Jesse Ohns's hand."
14:02;14:07;"Yeah, and there were 18 black athletes from the U.S. that went over and competed."
14:07;14:11;"And then like three years later, he invades Poland."
14:11;14:14;"Can you imagine? That seems like a really crazy one to me."
14:14;14:16;"I kind of want to read more about that."
15:35;15:37;"Well, you know what, man? Like, sure."
15:37;15:41;"Science has had a big impact on modern sportsmanship."
15:41;15:45;"But that only makes it more interesting, in my humble opinion."
15:45;15:48;"And I think it's really important as Americans."
15:48;15:53;"We got our guys and gals competing down there in Brazil."
15:53;15:57;"And I think it's really important that we get psyched about the Olympics."
15:57;16:00;"Do you think it's possible that you can get psyched?"
16:00;16:02;"I'm psyched about NBC's ad revenue."
16:02;16:05;"NBC's going to be raking it in. And you know who owns NBC?"
16:05;16:10;"Do you know how many stories I've heard about NBC and the contract they signed"
16:10;16:15;"that locked down the rights until 2024, and then they've only secured this amount of ad revenue?"
16:15;16:17;"It's just like, are you kidding me?"
16:17;16:20;"NBC apparently has been pretty harsh."
16:20;16:25;"And they won't let other channels use footage of the Olympics or something."
16:25;16:26;"Right."
16:26;16:30;"But you know what? I get it. Protect your content, NBC."
16:30;16:33;"I'm with it. Good for you."
16:33;16:34;"Pro-NBC."
16:34;16:36;"The Olympics aren't some--"
16:36;16:37;"They're there to make money, man."
16:37;16:42;"Yeah, what do you think the Olympics are? Some giant feel-good international thing bringing humanity together?"
16:42;16:46;"Of course not. It's content owned by General Electric."
16:46;16:47;"But anyway--"
16:47;16:48;"Hallelujah."
16:48;16:53;"I want to get you psyched on the Olympics, man, because you've been out there hiking."
16:53;16:58;"And you know what, man? I got to say, I think it's a little bit offensive that you would choose Olympics time"
16:58;17:01;"to kind of get off the grid because obviously you're not going to have good phone service."
17:01;17:05;"You're not going to get to watch our guys and gals compete live."
17:05;17:10;"So speaking of the guys and gals competing for us, do you know who Ryan Lochte is?"
17:10;17:11;"No."
17:11;17:12;"You never heard the name Ryan Lochte?"
17:12;17:13;"Never in my life."
17:13;17:18;"The last name is spelled L-O-C-H-T-E. Ryan Lochte."
17:18;17:19;"Where's he from?"
17:19;17:26;"Ryan Lochte is from Rochester, New York, a hell of a town, home to which major corporations?"
17:26;17:29;"Xerox and formerly Kodak."
17:29;17:31;"You're forgetting one biggie. IBM."
17:31;17:32;"Are they up there?"
17:32;17:33;"Maybe they're not there anymore. Whatever."
17:33;17:40;"Rochester's produced a lot of great American talent, whether Ryan Lochte or Xerox."
17:40;17:45;"So anyway, Ryan Lochte's a swimmer. He's not quite like a Phelps. He's like almost a Phelps."
17:45;17:49;"He's like the Joe Perry to Phelps's Steven Tyler."
17:49;17:51;"Okay. Younger generation?"
17:51;17:56;"I think he's a tiny bit younger. And also his catchphrase is ""ch-yeah."""
17:56;17:57;"What's that?"
17:57;18:00;"His catchphrase is ""ch-yeah."" Does that sound right?"
18:00;18:01;"How do you spell that?"
18:01;18:03;"Maybe it's more like ""ch-yeah!"""
18:03;18:09;"Is that like after he finishes the race, he hits the tile on the pool and he comes up? ""Ch-yeah!"""
18:09;18:10;"Or is it like..."
18:10;18:12;"I think, well, I don't know. Yossi used to have a reality show."
18:12;18:13;"He did?"
18:13;18:15;"Yeah, briefly. On E."
18:15;18:16;"That's deep."
18:16;18:19;"Because he wanted to show people he's not just a swimmer."
18:19;18:21;"He's pivoting, dude. He's looking towards the future."
18:21;18:24;"Yeah, I mean, exactly. I can relate to it."
18:24;18:30;"This show is like my version of Ryan Lochte's reality show."
18:30;18:32;"You're trying to get your media career going."
18:32;18:35;"That's right. Just showing people, man, it's not all about music."
18:35;18:36;"It's also about..."
18:36;18:38;"Semi-witty banter."
18:40;18:43;"So anyway, Ryan Lochte, he's a name you should definitely know."
18:43;18:49;"He's a swimming celebrity, and he's down there in Rio fighting for your freedom."
18:49;18:54;"And we got our hands on his pump-up mix."
18:54;18:55;"Okay."
18:55;19:03;"So we found out the five songs he likes to listen to when he's getting ready to jump in the pool and swim as hard and fast as he can."
19:03;19:05;"So we put together a little mega-mix."
19:05;19:06;"Earbuds in."
19:06;19:08;"Get those earbuds in."
19:08;19:09;"Hoodie on."
19:09;19:16;"If you're sitting at home listening to Time Crisis, you got the family gathered around the stereo system, everybody, throw it on your phone."
19:16;19:19;"Get those earbuds in. Start jogging around the block because you're going to get pumped up."
19:19;19:21;"This is Ryan Lochte's pump-up mix."
20:59;21:03;"Time Crisis with Ezra Keenan."
29:08;29:12;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
29:12;29:16;"Filling in for our regular host, Fareed Zakaria."
29:19;29:22;"Yeah! That was Ryan Lochte's pump-up mix."
29:22;29:25;"Now you feel a little more hype about the Olympics, Jake?"
29:25;29:26;"Yeah, bro."
29:27;29:31;"I wonder if ""chia"" is like, surfers going like, ""bruh"" or ""bro"" or ""bra""?"
29:31;29:34;"""Chia!"" Yeah, it sounds like a surfer kind of thing."
29:34;29:35;"What's up, bru?"
29:35;29:36;"Wait, wait, you call your bra your ""bru""?"
29:36;29:39;"I've heard it. I don't do it, but I've heard people do it."
29:39;29:41;"What up, bru-- Oh, I've never heard that. So what do they call ""brus""?"
29:41;29:44;"Old Kyle Field pushes the slang. Remember ""buff""?"
29:44;29:45;"Yeah."
29:45;29:49;"""Buff""-- What is ""buff"" to people who don't know? What does ""buff"" mean to a surfer?"
29:49;29:53;"Like a rough situation. Or like, ""This traffic is buff right now."""
29:53;29:54;"Yeah."
29:54;29:56;"Or like, kind of a ""buffy"" traff sitch."
29:56;29:58;"""Buffy"" traff sitch?"
29:58;30:02;"Like, ""Dude, I'm running late. Traffic is buff."""
30:02;30:04;"""Buffy"" traff sitch."
30:04;30:07;"How about a ""buffy"" trail sitch?"
30:07;30:08;"That can happen, dude."
30:08;30:14;"When I was camping with my parents and it was like, 28 degrees and we were freezing, that was a ""buff"" situation."
30:14;30:23;"Did you just like, unzip the tent like, ""Dad, this is buff. Dad, this is a buffy-ass sitch, man."""
30:23;30:24;"It's like, ""Jake--"""
30:24;30:26;"""What the hell, Dad?"""
30:26;30:30;"""Jake, zip up your North Face. Go to sleep."""
30:30;30:35;"""Jake, you're a 37-year-old man. Pull it together, man."""
30:35;30:41;"Oh, we just got some news that Ryan Lochte trademarked his catchphrase."
30:41;30:45;"I think it might be more like, ""Gee-yeah."" I was saying ""Gee-yeah."""
30:45;30:46;"But what does that mean?"
30:46;30:48;"I think it's like saying, like, ""Yeah!"""
30:48;30:54;"It's just like an utterance of like, pure Howard Dean scream style. Just like, guttural, from the soul."
30:54;30:58;"I think it's an affirmation. It's kind of like, remember Austin Powers?"
30:58;30:59;"Yeah."
30:59;31:00;"""Yeah, baby."""
31:00;31:04;"So he doesn't say that if he loses. Or maybe he does. He probably doesn't know if he loses."
31:04;31:07;"That's the crazy thing about swimming. You probably don't even know if you win or lose."
31:07;31:09;"When he wins, he says, ""Gee-yeah."""
31:09;31:10;"No."
31:10;31:12;"When he loses, he says, ""Nyah."""
31:12;31:16;"He goes, ""That was a buff. That was a buff!"""
31:16;31:17;"""Gee-yeah!"""
31:17;31:21;"So now that we're sufficiently excited about the Olympics,"
31:21;31:26;"a lot of people don't realize how much the Olympics is tied to music."
31:26;31:31;"If you can nail the perfect song to go along with a sporting event that gets people hype,"
31:31;31:35;"reminds them of a glorious time, you've made history."
31:35;31:39;"But every Olympics, people try. And it doesn't always work out."
31:39;31:43;"The good folks over at USA Today..."
31:43;31:49;"You notice how, like, I feel like a lot of people started saying ""folks"" post-Obama."
31:49;31:52;"Oh, yeah. I could see that."
31:52;31:58;"I don't know if ""folks"" is more common in different communities, if it's a racial or geographic thing,"
31:58;32:02;"but I just noticed people who I never heard say ""folks"" before,"
32:02;32:05;"who never would have said ""folks"" ages later, be like,"
32:05;32:10;"""So yeah, I was over at the mall. There was a bunch of folks getting pretty excited."""
32:10;32:12;"I'm like, ""What? Folks?"""
32:12;32:14;"I have nothing against the phrase ""folks."""
32:14;32:18;"I just think it's funny just to steal a phrase from the president."
32:18;32:25;"Anyway, the good folks at USA Today put together a list of their top ten Olympic songs."
32:25;32:29;"And these are songs that are either official Olympic songs,"
32:29;32:31;"or were co-opted by the Olympics,"
32:31;32:36;"or were maybe commissioned by a corporation that had major ties to the Olympics."
32:36;32:39;"One way or another, these songs are connected to the Olympics."
32:39;32:41;"You ready to count them down?"
32:41;32:42;"Yeah."
32:42;32:46;"Hopefully we'll learn a little bit about Olympics history in the process."
32:46;32:52;"The number ten song that USA Today chose is called ""Survival"" by the band Muse."
32:52;32:54;"Are you familiar with Muse?"
32:54;32:55;"Vaguely."
32:55;32:57;"They're a hard rockin' UK outfit."
32:57;32:59;"Kind of like a Radiohead ripoff?"
32:59;33:02;"Strong words, my friend. Strong words."
33:02;33:04;"I believe people have called them a Radiohead ripoff."
33:04;33:06;"Melodramatic post-rock?"
33:06;33:08;"Yes. People have said that."
33:08;33:12;"I'm sorry. I was spacing out for like 15 seconds."
33:12;33:17;"This is songs that were commissioned by/inspired by the Olympics?"
33:17;33:19;"Some of these songs were commissioned by the Olympics."
33:19;33:22;"Some of them were just used in various Olympic capacities."
33:22;33:24;"These are just songs associated with the Olympics."
33:24;33:25;"Okay."
33:25;33:29;"The good folks at USA Today are just trying to go for something pretty broad."
33:29;33:31;"Great. So what year is the Muse song?"
33:31;33:35;"All right. So Muse, do you remember where the 2012 Olympics were?"
33:35;33:37;"Beijing?"
33:37;33:39;"Far from it."
33:39;33:41;"Well, I don't remember then."
33:41;33:43;"When was Beijing? Like '08?"
33:43;33:45;"The Beijing Olympics were in 2008."
33:45;33:46;"Okay."
33:46;33:48;"The 2012 Olympics were in London."
33:48;33:51;"Don't you remember those classic London Olympics?"
33:51;33:52;"Very vaguely."
33:52;33:55;"So they went out to Radiohead and they said no."
33:55;34:00;"And they went out to Oasis and they said, ""We're too drunk and we're not rolling together anymore."""
34:00;34:01;"Hell no."
34:01;34:04;"I feel like Oasis would have, if they had their act together,"
34:04;34:06;"it would have been the perfect band to do the London Olympics."
34:06;34:08;"Oasis was broken up by the sun."
34:08;34:09;"So they went out to Muse."
34:09;34:11;"Okay. So a little further down the list they go to Muse."
34:11;34:15;"Very talented band in their own right, but perhaps not their first choice."
34:15;34:19;"I guess USA Today has some pretty harsh words."
34:19;34:24;"I guess a BBC radio host named John Holmes memorably compared this London Olympics theme"
34:24;34:29;"to an orchestra falling down some stairs and the noise of a rhino knocking a wall down."
34:29;34:31;"That's funny. That sounds like something--"
34:31;34:32;"That's ridiculous."
34:32;34:37;"That sounds like a diss that the opera critic from a paper would write in the 1890s."
34:37;34:42;"Stravinsky's new piece, Rite of Spring, sounds like a rhino knocking a wall down."
34:42;34:43;"Right. And somebody--"
34:43;34:45;"Good heavens."
34:45;34:46;"Sounds awful."
34:46;34:47;"Scandalous."
34:47;34:52;"But even USA Today calls this song an unbearable hodgepodge of crashing drums,"
34:52;34:57;"dramatic strings, and strained vocals, and maybe the game's worst official song."
34:57;34:58;"Now hold on a second."
34:58;35:00;"Is this super dissonant or something?"
35:00;35:01;"Let's find out."
35:02;35:08;"Woke up, got out of bed, pulled a comb across my head."
35:08;35:12;"Yeah!"
35:12;35:16;"Where are those vocals, Muse? Come on."
35:16;35:25;"Sounds very British."
35:25;35:30;"It sounds very orderly, too."
35:31;35:34;"Are there not going to be vocals?"
35:34;35:44;"Drums sound terrible. No disrespect to the producer."
35:44;35:47;"Well, not my kind of drums."
35:58;36:01;"I like that Muse has a sense of humor."
36:01;36:03;"They're getting a little quirky."
36:03;36:10;"So this is sort of like if Stone Temple Pilots had a song for the '96 Atlanta Olympics."
36:10;36:17;"Roughly."
36:17;36:20;"Maybe more like it's live."
36:20;36:23;"Yeah, maybe that's better."
36:23;36:26;"Oh, they went heavy."
36:26;36:42;"Can you imagine?"
36:42;36:45;"Oh, they're going in with this guitar here."
36:45;36:49;"I kind of respect it."
36:49;36:52;"Can you imagine the Olympic Committee in London?"
36:52;36:56;"Like, ""OK, guys, we got the final mix back. Let's listen to it."""
36:56;37:00;"Just playing this for Prince Charles."
37:00;37:05;"Yeah, playing this to a very silent boardroom."
37:05;37:07;"Excellent."
37:07;37:10;"Kind of a Queen vibe here."
37:10;37:12;"Oh, yeah, big time."
37:12;37:21;"Actually, I'm kind of into it."
37:22;37:26;"We have called upon all the countries of Earth"
37:26;37:31;"to gather in our imperial capital of London."
37:31;37:34;"Wow, the lead singing is brutal."
37:34;37:36;"He has a good voice, though."
37:36;37:39;"Maybe not his finest moment."
37:39;37:42;"They were going for it, at least."
37:42;37:44;"You know what that just made me think about?"
37:44;37:47;"What's so crazy is, like, the human stories of the Olympics."
37:47;37:48;"That's real."
37:48;37:51;"Somebody working hard and achieving something."
37:51;37:53;"We're not talking about an eight-mile hike, man."
37:53;37:55;"We're talking about 10, 15 years of training."
37:55;37:57;"Giving your whole life to something."
37:57;37:58;"Dedicating your life."
37:58;38:00;"Health and fitness."
38:00;38:01;"That's serious."
38:01;38:03;"But everything else about the Olympics"
38:03;38:07;"is, like, truly playing on people's emotions"
38:07;38:09;"in, like, a pretty crass way."
38:09;38:13;"You know, like, the countries, like, they work so hard to win the bid."
38:13;38:17;"It's supposedly going to pay off for, like, the people who are going to win."
38:17;38:20;"It's supposedly going to pay off for, like, the people of the city."
38:20;38:24;"As always, the elites are the ones walking off with the suitcases full of cash."
38:24;38:29;"But also, it's like this kind of awkward infomercial for the city."
38:29;38:30;"Right."
38:30;38:33;"When you watch the Olympics on NBC, they keep cutting the stuff, like,"
38:33;38:36;"""Let's take a minute to learn more about the city of Rio."""
38:36;38:38;"And, you know, like, when they do the opening ceremony,"
38:38;38:41;"it's kind of like this presentation about, like, the culture of the country."
38:41;38:44;"It really is like an infomercial that's kind of like,"
38:44;38:46;"""China, open for business."""
38:46;38:48;"Beijing 2008."
38:48;38:51;"If we can afford to make this thing, we're pretty poppin'."
38:51;38:55;"Anyway, the number nine song is ""Barcelona."""
38:55;39:00;"Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé might be mispronouncing that."
39:00;39:04;"This is a fine duet taken off the Queen frontman's 1988 joint album"
39:04;39:06;"of the same name with the Spanish opera star."
39:06;39:08;"Let's check it out."
39:08;39:11;"The '88 Olympics? Seoul?"
39:11;39:13;"No, maybe Barcelona."
39:13;39:15;"Oh."
39:15;39:17;"Yeah, you're probably right."
39:17;39:41;"The Barcelona Olympics were '92."
39:41;39:47;"# I had this perfect dream"
39:47;39:50;"# Sueno me volvio"
39:50;39:52;"# This dream was me and you"
39:52;39:55;"# Ai me ce sono"
39:55;39:58;"# I want all the world to see"
39:58;40:01;"# L'instinto me chiuva"
40:01;40:03;"# A lyrical sensation"
40:03;40:06;"# My guiding inspiration"
40:06;40:14;"# Almighty, we're slowly coming true"
40:14;40:21;"# The wind is a gentle breeze"
40:21;40:24;"# Oh, and you're... #"
40:24;40:27;"I'm in. I'm in. Yes."
40:27;40:30;"It makes me sad about the Muse song a little bit."
40:30;40:32;"Yeah, it's kind of better than the Muse song."
40:32;40:36;"It's like, ""Oh, OK, that's a more appropriate match"
40:36;40:38;"""between talent and the event."""
40:38;40:40;"Oh, I don't know if I'd say that."
40:40;40:42;"You know, the Olympics... I would say that."
40:42;40:45;"The Olympics used to be, like, all about amateur athletes."
40:45;40:47;"Do you remember that? It's true."
40:47;40:50;"It used to be, like, NBA players couldn't play in the Olympics."
40:50;40:52;"Right. Until, like, the Dream Team."
40:52;40:55;"So in the early '80s, they were just like,"
40:55;40:57;"""You play for the Washington Wizards,"
40:57;40:59;"""so you cannot compete in the Olympics,"
40:59;41:02;"""but you gymnast who's been training in, like,"
41:02;41:06;"""a federally funded gym for, like, the past five years,"
41:06;41:09;"""you're an amateur. You can come on down."""
41:09;41:11;"What does that mean? Yeah, it's weird."
41:11;41:13;"Plus, I think all the athletes now are..."
41:13;41:14;"That's what they do."
41:14;41:16;"They're not, like, a schoolteacher"
41:16;41:18;"who happens to be great at gym."
41:18;41:20;"That'd be cool."
41:20;41:26;"# We'll meet again"
41:27;41:30;"# Someday..."
41:30;41:33;"The number-eight song on the USA Today list"
41:33;41:36;"of songs tangentially related to the Olympics"
41:36;41:38;"is Rise by Katy Perry."
41:38;41:41;"It has impassioned lyrics about perseverance."
41:41;41:44;"Ready to hear it? Yeah."
41:44;41:47;"I think she also performed this at the DNC."
41:47;41:50;"I was going to say, she's having a big summer."
41:50;41:53;"# I won't justify"
41:53;41:57;"# Oh, you will see me thrive... #"
41:57;42:00;"Thrive. # Can write my story... #"
42:00;42:03;"I think that word was also in the Muse song."
42:03;42:05;"# I'm beyond the... #"
42:05;42:08;"There's, like, a real tension between the authenticity"
42:08;42:11;"of the athletes who have dedicated their whole lives"
42:11;42:14;"to this moment, and then, like, the spectacle of it all,"
42:14;42:18;"where they're going to get someone like Katy Perry,"
42:18;42:20;"who's famous."
42:20;42:23;"Katy Perry devoted her life to singing and songwriting."
42:23;42:25;"Well, yeah."
42:25;42:28;"There isn't a sense of, like, sacrifice and risk"
42:28;42:30;"with Katy Perry, though."
42:30;42:32;"I'll stop you right there, Jake."
42:32;42:35;"Clearly you don't know much about Katy Perry."
42:35;42:38;"That makes me actually a better judge of her work,"
42:38;42:40;"because I don't know her biography,"
42:40;42:42;"and I'm just hearing her music."
42:42;42:44;"First of all, I'm a big Katy Perry fan."
42:44;42:47;"And if you don't think she's had adversity in her life..."
42:47;42:50;"I'm not saying she didn't have adversity."
42:50;42:52;"Do you know what her real name is? No."
42:52;42:54;"It's Kate Hudson. That's tough."
42:54;42:56;"That's a tough hand to be dealt."
42:56;42:59;"Imagine that your real last name was Gyllenhaal."
42:59;43:01;"You're trying to do an art show somewhere,"
43:01;43:04;"and everybody's like, ""Oh, cool, Jake Gyllenhaal paints?"""
43:04;43:06;"And you're like, ""Yeah, man."""
43:06;43:08;"Then they roll up all disappointed,"
43:08;43:11;"and then you've got to change your name just to survive?"
43:11;43:13;"That's messed up. So that's messed up."
43:13;43:16;"So she had to change her name from Kate Hudson to Katy Perry."
43:16;43:18;"Notoriously difficult to get out of."
43:18;43:21;"Mm-hmm. But she did. Now she's thriving."
43:21;43:24;"I'm not even going after her as a person."
43:24;43:26;"OK, you're saying the song does not have..."
43:26;43:28;"Her work does not-- to me, her work"
43:28;43:31;"and what she, in a broad sense, symbolizes in the culture"
43:31;43:36;"seems like a bad match for, like, struggle and perseverance"
43:36;43:41;"that are the qualities that we value in these athletes."
43:41;43:44;"You don't feel the dark majesty of this chorus?"
43:44;43:46;"No."
43:46;43:49;"I mean, obviously, the person who's going to sing the song"
43:49;43:53;"to represent the sacrifice and the hard work of our athletes,"
43:53;43:55;"they have to have a big old voice."
43:55;43:58;"I don't agree with that. You can't have a Bob Dylan."
43:58;44:00;"Well, nothing Dylan."
44:00;44:02;"Here's what I'm saying."
44:02;44:05;"I'd like it if the musicians were equally obscure"
44:05;44:07;"as the athletes are."
44:07;44:09;"So if it was some sort of, like, you know,"
44:09;44:12;"some dude from Ghana playing guitar,"
44:12;44:15;"it would feel more harmonious to me."
44:15;44:19;"I'm sure Ghana has its own Olympics Katy Perry songs."
44:19;44:21;"Well, that's what I want to hear."
44:21;44:24;"Well, the number seven song is by somebody"
44:24;44:28;"that you probably respect more than Katy Perry, Bjork."
44:28;44:30;"Sure."
44:30;44:34;"There's more sense of risk and adversity with her."
44:34;44:35;"For what?"
44:35;44:37;"What do you mean, for what?"
44:37;44:39;"I mean, like, her work aesthetically is just--"
44:39;44:41;"Right, yeah, but how did the risk pay off?"
44:41;44:43;"The question is that Bjork's a legend."
44:43;44:44;"She'll be remembered--"
44:44;44:47;"Well, we don't actually know how she'll be remembered."
44:47;44:49;"I'm not even going to get into that territory."
44:49;44:50;"You know what, man?"
44:50;44:53;"This Icelandic trailblazer blends rippling synths"
44:53;44:56;"and whirring siren calls on this nautical ballad."
44:56;44:58;"Oh, whirring siren calls."
44:58;45:00;"I like the concept of a nautical ballad."
45:00;45:02;"I've tried to write nautical ballads before."
45:02;45:06;"This was written specifically for the 2004 Summer Games in Greece."
45:06;45:08;"Remember those '04 games in Greece?"
45:08;45:09;"Vaguely."
45:09;45:11;"It was a real boon for the Greek economy."
45:11;45:12;"Worked out great."
45:12;45:14;"All the international attention on Greece"
45:14;45:17;"taking it back to the homeland of the Olympics"
45:17;45:20;"really brought in a lot of foreign investment."
45:20;45:21;"That's a bummer."
45:21;45:23;"Kick-start the economy."
45:23;45:25;"This was on the album Adula."
45:25;45:28;"She says she wrote it for the 2004 Summer Games in Greece."

46:53;46:54;"I couldn't stop writing, man."
46:54;46:56;"Glory of love, dude."
46:56;46:58;"So Bjork wrote that song."
46:58;47:01;"According to the good folks at USA Today,"
47:01;47:03;"she wrote that song for the Olympics."
47:03;47:07;"This next one, this is a proper Olympics anthem."
47:07;47:09;"It was for the 2010 Winter Olympics."
47:09;47:12;"There's no way you could forget where the 2010 Winter Olympics were."
47:12;47:13;"Utah?"
47:13;47:16;"Oh, you're killing me, man."
47:16;47:18;"They were, of course, in Vancouver."

47:23;47:26;"I think you're thinking of the 2006 Olympics."

47:30;47:32;"Shout out to Romney."
47:32;47:34;"Romney."
47:34;47:37;"So this song was for the 2010 Olympics, Vancouver,"
47:37;47:42;"so they had to get a couple Canadian stars to collab on a song."
47:42;47:43;"Bryan Adams."
47:43;47:45;"Oh, wow. Yes."
47:45;47:46;"Really?"
47:46;47:47;"Uh-huh."

47:50;47:53;"I would love to say Joni Mitchell, but not her."
47:53;47:54;"Of course not."
47:54;47:55;"She would never do that."
47:55;47:57;"She might, but that would be tight."
47:57;47:58;"But no."
47:58;47:59;"Somebody--"
47:59;48:00;"From that era, '80s?"
48:00;48:02;"No, no, no, no, more from like the '90s, 2000s era."
48:02;48:04;"Oh, Celine?"
48:04;48:05;"No."
48:05;48:06;"She's made for it."
48:06;48:07;"Oh, yeah, how could they not get Celine?"
48:07;48:08;"She clearly said no."
48:08;48:10;"Canadian Olympics song."
48:10;48:11;"Shania?"
48:11;48:12;"No."
48:12;48:14;"Remember, she kind of disowned Canada."
48:14;48:16;"She lives in Switzerland."
48:16;48:18;"Jeez."
48:18;48:19;"I don't know."
48:19;48:21;"Nelly Furtado."
48:21;48:22;"Oh, okay, I wouldn't know she's Canadian."
48:22;48:24;"You didn't know that Nelly Furtado was Canadian?"
48:24;48:25;"Nope."

58:28;58:29;"This is from '88."
58:29;58:31;"This is four years after ""We Are the World."""
58:31;58:33;"It's from that era."
58:33;58:35;"It's heavily indebted to ""We Are the World."""
58:35;58:37;"It's been a long time since there was a charity single"
58:37;58:39;"that really took over the world."
58:39;58:40;"Yeah."
58:40;58:43;"Do you think people--our hearts are just too hard now"
58:43;58:46;"to accept a simple sentiment like ""We Are the World""?"
58:46;58:49;"I think the medium is just too old."
58:49;58:50;"It's atrophied."
58:50;58:53;"I don't think you'd be possible to write a song like that"
58:53;58:55;"that actually resonated."
58:55;58:58;"Because of the empty promises of globalization?"
58:58;59:02;"No, no, I mean rock and pop songwriting is just--"
59:02;59:05;"what are we, 60 years out from Elvis?"
59:05;59:08;"I just feel like it's played out, dog."
59:08;59:09;"Just rock music."
59:09;59:12;"Yeah, like the medium, that style of songwriting is atrophied."
59:12;59:15;"Why can't you do a pop R&B one?"
59:15;59:17;"I'm putting it all under the same umbrella."
59:17;59:19;"Post-war pop music."
59:19;59:21;"Okay, but here's a question."
59:21;59:25;"What if ""Fight Song,"" which is a Tom Christmas favorite,"
59:25;59:30;"wasn't Rachel Plantains, but instead was given to"
59:30;59:34;"Rachel Plantains, Justin Bieber, Britney Spears,"
59:34;59:38;"maybe some international people like Psy,"
59:38;59:41;"and became this global thing, and the chorus is just like"
59:41;59:43;"all these people coming--oh, wait, actually, I forgot"
59:43;59:45;"they did that at the DMC."
59:45;59:49;"That's a bad--it's not actually a wholesome song."
59:49;59:50;"""Fight Song""?"
59:50;59:51;"Yeah."
59:51;59:52;"Well, I'm just saying large numbers of people"
59:52;59:53;"still respond to it."
59:53;59:56;"I know, but this is my subjective vibe right now."
59:56;59:58;"Oh, you're just saying you wouldn't like it."
59:58;01:00:01;"I'm trying to get to the bottom of why I think"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"the South Korean song from 1988 is the best one"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"we've heard so far."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Okay."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"For the event."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"And it reminded me of ""We Are The World."""
01:00:10;01:00:13;"And there's something in the zeitgeist,"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"something that is intangible that makes it impossible"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"to write a song like that today."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"And I don't think ""Fight Song"" is like that."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"I think ""Fight Song"" was trying to be like that,"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"but it's not."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"You just feel like it didn't hit the artistic mark."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"It didn't hit that emotional mark, yeah."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"We're living in the end times, man."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"God is dead."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"People got nothing to believe in anymore."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"You're right, it's harder to get people pumped."
01:00:36;01:00:39;"Look, we have our two least popular presidential"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"candidates in history."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Nations divided."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"People can't unite under the banner of a simple idea"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"like ""We Are The World"" anymore."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Yeah."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"Number two, ""The Power of the Dream"" by Celine Dion."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Okay, we had the right impulse."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Of course Celine Dion had something to do with the Olympics."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Yeah."
01:00:55;01:01:00;"A voice like that, it can only work for certain things,"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"like Las Vegas."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Titanic."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"The Olympics."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Yeah."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"You know what I mean?"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"It's like, in some ways, your voice is your destiny."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"I wonder if they're going to go to a Dell in the future."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"If the Olympics come back to London, they'd probably try."
01:01:19;01:01:24;"So she kicked off the '96 Summer Olympics in Atlanta."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"That was a very eventful Olympics."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yeah, there was that weird bombing."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"Yeah."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"Which they never figured out who did it."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Yeah, but they blamed that dude Richard Jewell."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Right."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Really put that guy through the wringer."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Can you imagine meeting that guy?"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"He was like a very sweet natured security guard"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"who told everybody to clear out,"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"and then they were like very quickly they needed to pin it on somebody,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"because they wanted people to feel safe."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"They're just like, ""We got him."""
01:01:47;01:01:50;"He's like, ""No, I'm a security guard."""
01:01:50;01:01:51;"That must have been so terrifying,"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"that first day or something in custody."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"I think it ruined his life."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Yeah."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"So the Olympics bring people a lot of joy."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"They also ruin lives."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"So the power of the dream, Celine Dion."
01:02:04;01:02:08;"You know this is going to be big."
01:02:08;01:02:12;"So '96 you could still find some power."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"Deep within each heart"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"There lies a magic spark"
01:02:24;01:02:31;"That lights the fire of our imagination"
01:02:31;01:02:35;"And since the dawn of man"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"The strength of just ""I can"""
01:02:38;01:02:45;"Has brought together people of all nations"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"There's nothing ordinary"
01:02:48;01:02:52;"In the living of each day"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"There's a special part"
01:02:54;01:02:58;"Every one of us will play"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"Feel the flame forever"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"This is the most literal song so far."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Teaching lessons we must learn"
01:03:05;01:03:08;"To bring us closer to"
01:03:08;01:03:12;"The power of the dream"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"As the world gives us its best"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"To stand apart from all the rest"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"It is the power of the dream"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"That brings us here"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Literally no metaphor."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"Oh, nice. Marshall snare drum."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"This is one of my least favorite musical tropes."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Oh, the..."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"'Cause this kind of came back a little bit"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"in like mid-2000s indie."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"Like who would be doing that? Like Mumford?"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"I don't believe so. I'm never gonna name names."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"But just in general..."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"Grow a pair, dude. Name some names."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"No, 'cause I really don't have anything"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"against any individual songs."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"You just hate it as a trope."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"I'm like allergic to it as a trope."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"More like that."
01:03:54;01:03:57;"It's like you put in a..."
01:03:57;01:04:01;"It's supposed to give this faux feeling of like grandeur"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"'cause it's like military and like..."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"You know in like horror movie trailers"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"when they'll play like a nursery rhyme"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"and then there's like..."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"He's back."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"It's just like such an obvious lame contrast"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"and I can't believe they still do it."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"But in that same way, it's such a visual thing"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"'cause it's some kind of like lame song"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"about like, you know, believe in yourself"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"but like a kind of half-baked one."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"And then it's like,"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"let's just throw some like snare drums"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"so we just picture like a little drummer boy"
01:04:28;01:04:32;"who just got his ear blown off"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"by a Confederate soldier."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"(imitates snare drum)"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"I don't know."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"I'm not saying it's impossible to use well."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"It's a guarantee."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Yeah."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"It's a trope that you know will elicit this effect"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"and you're not using it in an original way."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"You know what?"
01:04:48;01:04:52;"If a soldier wrote a song with a Marshall snare drum,"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"I would say thank you."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"This is a tough..."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"I mean, these songs that we're talking about"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"are in an impossible situation"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"because we're judging them as like art"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"but they're not actually functioning as art."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"They're functioning to like bring"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"the widest possible group of people together."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Did you say the widest possible"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"or the whitest possible group of people?"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"(laughter)"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"Maybe that was a weird slip of the tongue."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"That was a Freudian slip."

01:09:25;01:09:27;"was saying for the first time."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"At least half the country didn't. Yeah."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"And there was, like, really this big pushback."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"And then there was a pushback to the pushback"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Yeah. It's morning in America."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"One last gasp of, like, feel good,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"fight the commies, we believe in this."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"And then after that, it was a wrap."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"Yeah. Which brings us to the present day,"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"our current situation."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"Nothing to believe in, no good tunes anymore."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Whitney's gone."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Rocks played out. Rocks played out."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Donald Trump, Frito-Lay Corporation."

01:10:00;01:10:02;"We're on, like, a bad trip right now, dude."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"Yeah, this is supposed to be a positive episode."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"This is supposed to be all about health and fitness"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"and the motherf---ing Olympics."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"So let's get things back on track, man."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Okay."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"'Cause actually, a lot of people write songs"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"for the Olympics unofficially."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"We've been listening to a lot of the official jams."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Mm-hmm."
01:10:23;01:10:26;"But recently, Bell and Sebastian,"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"they put out an instrumental tune"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"called ""Olympic Village 6 A.M."""
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Wow."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"I think they were just kind of inspired."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"They were psyched about the Olympics."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"They've had a lot of health and fitness in their songs."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"They used to have a song called"

01:10:55;01:10:56;"That was my impression of Stewart."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Yeah."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"He ran Track and Field."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Oh, really?"

01:12:34;01:12:36;"It's not a very interesting story,"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"but it's just like life on the road as a musician,"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"especially when you're going all over the world,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"sometimes you get really jet lagged,"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"and you wake up really early,"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"and you come down to the hotel buffet,"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"and sometimes if your other bands are in town"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"or you're at a festival,"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"it can be a little bit like a school cafeteria vibe,"
01:12:55;01:12:58;"because, you know, it's like at lunch or dinner,"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"you might get the bands are rolling together,"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"but in the morning, you know,"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"one dude wakes up at 4.30, one dude sleeps through,"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"you never know, so you kind of go down solo."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"So I've had a few of those experiences over the years"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"where you come down and you just like see somebody"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"sitting by themselves, and it's like,"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"""Hey, what's up, man?"""
01:13:13;01:13:18;"So I feel like, I think I was down there at this hotel in Seoul,"
01:13:18;01:13:22;"and I've always been a big Bell & Sebastian fan,"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"and I saw Stewart eating breakfast by himself,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"and I think I literally just rolled up cafeteria style,"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"just like holding, you know, I hit my breakfast,"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"and I was just like, ""Hey, what's up, man?"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"""Mind if I join you?"""
01:13:33;01:13:34;"A little bit out of character for me,"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"but like, I don't know."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"You have to imagine growing up listening to Bell & Sebastian,"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"you have to imagine that Stewart's a nice guy."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Like, I wouldn't do that to Tom York."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- Right."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Actually, I do mind."
01:13:46;01:13:50;"He would probably just stare at you and not say a word."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- Actually, I have a ""Stewart is a nice guy"" story."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"- Really?"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"- I lived in San Francisco in like the early 2000s, like '03,"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"and there was a friend of mine that would always host house shows."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"He had like a tiny backyard in this little row house"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"in the Mission District."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"And so I forget who was even playing."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"Maybe it was like Pound Sign,"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"some kind of local pop, San Francisco pop band."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"- Yeah."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"- But anyway, Stewart showed up to the show."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"He knew someone that was there or something."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"And then they were like passing a hat around"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"for everyone to put in like a few dollars."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"- Yeah."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"- And he threw in $100."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"- Tight."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"- I saw it, I was like--"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"- It was back in the '90s when that meant something."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"- Or like '03."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"But yeah, it was like--"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"It meant something."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"Everyone else put in like $3."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"- Yeah."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"- Anyway, I was very impressed."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Very classy move."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"- You know, I feel like if that happened today,"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"you'd probably have somebody on Snapchat being like,"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"""Look at Stewart trying to stunt on us."""
01:14:44;01:14:46;"- More negative time."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"- He gave $100 to this touring band."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"What an a-hole."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"- Yeah, why didn't you give $10,000?"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"Dib."
01:14:55;01:14:58;"But anyway, Stewart is a very nice guy"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"to any of the younger folks."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I really hate saying that, but I also love it."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"To any of the younger folks listening,"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"if you don't know Bell and Sebastian,"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"they are legends."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"You gotta go listen to some of those first few albums."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"- Great band."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"- We're agreeing for once."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- That's true."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Bell and Sebastian--"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"- Who would have thought Bell and Sebastian"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"would see eye to eye on?"
01:15:18;01:15:21;"- Bell and Sebastian is so like--"
01:15:21;01:15:25;"They're such like poster children for indie"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"that when indie falls out of fashion,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"so do they, you know, in a certain place."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"But it's also like they're the type of band,"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"like, when you really go back"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"and you look at the quality of the songwriting,"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"it's like, you know, like the Smets."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"It's classic."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"That's what I believe."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"- I agree completely."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"That's my goddamn opinion."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"You know what, another song"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"that was unofficially written for the Olympics,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"or at least was not chosen,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Randy Newman, ""I Love L.A."""
01:15:51;01:15:52;"- Really?"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"- Yeah, '84 Olympics."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"We're in Los Angeles."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Remember that was a big deal"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"'cause people were mad about the smog."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"- Right."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"- Remember smog?"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"- Oh, I remember."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"- Nobody talks about smog anymore."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"- People talk about it,"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"but it's a lot better than it used to be."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"- I never hear anybody talking about smog."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"When was the last time you heard"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"somebody talking about smog?"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- Yesterday."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- Psh."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"Now you're just playing with me."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Who?"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"- My girlfriend."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"- Fuck."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"(laughing)"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"I call (beep) man."
01:16:21;01:16:23;"Nobody talks about smog anymore."
01:16:23;01:16:26;"- No, on Monday, my dad mentioned smog."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"- Psh."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"- I have a very specific memory of it."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"But anyway, let's move on."
01:16:31;01:16:34;"- So, Randy Newman was asked to write a song"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"to be the theme for the '84 Olympics."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"He's a classic L.A. musician."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"- He's perfect for that."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"- He's perfect for it."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"But whoever asked him,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"they should have done a little more research"
01:16:44;01:16:50;"'cause Randy Newman is known to be very sarcastic."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"- Sly."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"- Sly, ironic."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"- Mm-hmm."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"- He'll say things in a song that he doesn't mean."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"If one of his big hits, ""Short People,"""
01:16:57;01:16:58;"got no reason to live,"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"apparently he doesn't feel that way."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"(laughing)"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"Apparently he was trying to shine a harsh light"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"on society's prejudices."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"- I wonder if they went out to Brian Wilson for that."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"- He might have been--"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"- 'Cause he's so sincere."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"- Yeah, Brian Wilson '84 I don't think was pretty."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"- Yeah, not in any condition, and nor was Harry Nielsen."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"- But, no, I would have asked the Beach Boys"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"just to write about it."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"- Yeah."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"- I think in '84, when did Dennis die?"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"- Before that."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- Oh, yeah, well, I don't need to--"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"- You know what would have been gnarly?"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Like, Glenn Frey solo."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"(laughing)"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"- Perfect."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"I'd be into that."
01:17:34;01:17:38;"- Or, like, you know, Van Halen was huge in '84."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"- Oh, yeah, they should have just made ""Jump"""
01:17:40;01:17:41;"the official song."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"- Oh, that would have been sick."
01:17:42;01:17:45;"- But anyway, they asked Randy Newman to write a song,"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"and so he wrote a song called ""I Love L.A."""
01:17:48;01:17:49;"So far, so good, right?"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"- Yep."
01:17:50;01:17:51;"- Sounds perfect."
01:17:51;01:17:54;"And then they started looking through the lyrics,"
01:17:54;01:17:58;"and you start to realize that he's maybe turning"
01:17:58;01:18:02;"that classic harsh Newman glare"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"on the inadequacies of L.A."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"They're like, ""Man, the Olympics is not about"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"pointing out the flaws in humanity."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"It's about pretending they don't exist."""
01:18:12;01:18:13;"(laughing)"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"And a lot of people don't really know,"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"'cause, you know, they still play ""I Love L.A."""
01:18:19;01:18:20;"at, like, sporting events, and--"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"- Yeah."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"- And ""I Love L.A.""-- I love it."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"- Yeah, I love it, too."
01:18:24;01:18:25;"- I love ""I Love L.A."""
01:18:25;01:18:27;"- Remind me of some of the lyrics, though."
01:18:27;01:18:28;"It's been a while."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"- Okay."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"""Rollin' down somethin' highway"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"with a big nasty redhead at my side."""
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Already a weird thing to say."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"(laughing)"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- Nasty."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"- There's this beginning about how he hates New York City,"

01:18:53;01:18:57;"He's already kind of mocking intercity competition,"

01:19:00;01:19:01;"too rugged for them,"
01:19:01;01:19:04;"you're also kind of saying that you're like lamb."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"It's not good if the city's too rugged for you."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"So in the opening lines of the real part of the song,"

01:19:29;01:19:32;"And then he's saying all this really positive stuff,"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"and he's saying, ""I love L.A."""

01:25:08;01:25:09;"Camouflage."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"That's not a good accent."

01:25:25;01:25:26;"that felt fresh,"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"was like these one-word album titles."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"Like in the '70s,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"it was like these long sentences."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Like Dark Side of the Moon,"

01:25:50;01:25:52;"Camouflage."
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Right."
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Yeah, also that was the era where like,"

01:27:27;01:27:28;"Okay."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Plays the Joker."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Oh, really?"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"He's getting rave reviews--"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Okay, I can see that."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"For a twisted performance as the Joker."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"And they really went big."
01:27:37;01:27:40;"This was like a huge budget, like, tentpole film,"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"so they went big with the soundtrack, of course."
01:27:42;01:27:43;"Yeah, yeah."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"So they got all sorts of big people,"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"like Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa,"
01:27:46;01:27:49;"to get together and make a song."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"So this is a song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack,"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"number five on iTunes,"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Sucker for Pain."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"I told you, yeah."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"I haven't heard from Wayne in a while."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"He's been a little quiet."
01:28:01;01:28:11;"Oh, there's even more people on this song."
01:28:11;01:28:14;"X Ambassadors, kind of an alt-rock band."
01:28:14;01:28:17;"Logic, Ty Dolla $ign."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"All on this one song?"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Yeah."
01:28:24;01:28:27;"This sounds so much more full spectrum and lush"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"than that Rod Stewart."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Yeah."
01:28:30;01:28:47;"It's fun."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"Do you think Rod Stewart still plays that song live?"
01:28:50;01:28:53;"You're back to '84."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"If it was a hit single, probably sometimes, yeah."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"I've never heard that song in my life, though,"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"and I'm pretty tapped in with Rod's career"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"and with FM radio airplay."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"I've never heard that in my life."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"I don't understand how somebody who calls himself"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"Rodhead could let a top-five single"

01:29:13;01:29:15;"You don't know as much about Rod as you thought."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Back to 1984."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"This is a pretty strong one."
01:29:19;01:29:23;"The number four song this week in '84 was Tina Turner."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"What's Love Got to Do With It?"
01:29:26;01:29:29;"Unreal. Classic."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"This also just sounds better than the Rod song."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"It sounds amazing."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"That Rod song sounded like--"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"you know that scene in Boogie Nights"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"when Wahlberg and Riley are making that demo tape?"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Yeah."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"That's what that sounded like."
01:29:40;01:29:45;"Well, you know, people say that"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"when there's a lot of cocaine flowing"

01:29:49;01:29:51;"sometimes people mix stuff."

01:40:17;01:40:18;"What about us?"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"Yeah, exactly."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"So, you know, so this is after Thriller."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"Yeah, yeah."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"Yeah, then they make this album, Victory,"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"which is also a big album."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"But I'm sure he felt somewhat obligated to do it,"

01:41:06;01:41:07;"Wait, hold on."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Let's hear for that change."
01:41:15;01:41:20;"This is like, that riff is like the most stock, like bar band."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"This could be like a ZZ Top song."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Yeah."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Bad Top."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"But when that voice comes in, out of this."

01:41:33;01:41:36;"Oh, yeah, I know this song."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"This has no vibe."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"It kind of sounds like the Rolling Stones,"

01:41:46;01:41:48;"[singing]"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Yeah."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"It's no Thriller."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"But way stiffer."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"You know, that was the vibe in the '80s,"
01:41:53;01:41:57;"was like early drum machine."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Yeah."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Whatever."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"It's okay."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"Back to 2016."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"Yep."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Justin's on the charts twice,"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"because there's a new song by DJ Snake called"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"""Let Me Love You"" featuring Justin Bieber."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Again, the same palette."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"That's the palette of our time."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"A little--"
01:42:17;01:42:20;"It's kind of reverb-y."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"It's slower."
01:42:21;01:42:22;"You know, it's tropical."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"You could listen to this in the club."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"You could also play this at a bonfire at the beach."

01:44:30;01:44:32;"- The intro to the verse to the pre-chorus"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"to the chorus to the drop."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"- That's when you drop in with the octave pedal."

01:44:38;01:44:39;"- Snake, man."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"The people have spoken, man."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"- Or like--"

01:44:44;01:44:47;"We wanna hear some Jimmy Page."

01:44:58;01:44:59;"- Get in, man."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"- Bring that same octave pedal and just,"
01:45:01;01:45:04;"(imitating guitar)"
01:45:04;01:45:05;"That was a bummer."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"The drop on the Chainsmokers song was more interesting."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"- Yeah."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"- Kudos to the Chainsmokers."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Budos to DJ Snake."
01:45:13;01:45:17;"Back to 1984."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"The number one song this month in 1984,"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"history repeats itself, man,"
01:45:22;01:45:27;"was for a movie that a lot of people think came out in 2016."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"- Oh."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"- But I wanna let all the kids know something"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"that actually this movie that everybody got excited"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"about this summer, it was based on an older film"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"that came out in 1984 called Ghostbusters."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"- One of my favorite films of all time."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- It's a great film."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"They had the theme song was by a guy called Ray Parker Jr."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"and it was called Ghostbusters."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"This is a big song, man."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"- Huge."
01:45:50;01:45:54;"- He got sued by Huey Lewis for it, though."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"- Right."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"(dramatic music)"
01:46:00;01:46:07;"- '80s pop is so weird, just that kinda like"
01:46:07;01:46:10;"de-fanged rock, like (imitates rock music)"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"- That's a great way to put it, de-fanged rock."

01:46:25;01:46:29;"- The montage scene in the film is when their business"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"is just taking off and ghosts are"
01:46:31;01:46:35;"spreading out all over the city."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"No job is too big, no fee is too big."
01:46:37;01:46:41;"- That's right, it's classic beginning of act two of a film."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"- We're ready to believe you."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"- Right, the teams come together and things are growing."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"- Remember when Sigourney opens her fridge"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"and there's just that temple and the dogs?"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"- Oh yeah, temple of the dogs."

01:46:55;01:46:56;"just like--"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- That was in the first one."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:46:58;01:46:59;"- Oh, the second one's the painting."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"- So that's what was poppin' back in the summer of '84."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"Ghostbusters, good."
01:47:05;01:47:05;"Not great."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"- Not a great song, but--"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"- I mean, all in all, that was a decent top five for '84."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"- I mean, the Tina and the Bruce, I mean--"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"- The Tina and the Bruce really helped."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"- Let's not shortchange the Rod, though."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- The Rod was garbage."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"I think the Jaxx is pretty good."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Ghostbusters, it is what it is."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"Now, the number one song on iTunes this week"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"is also from the Suicide Squad soundtrack."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"All right, so that's an obvious parallel right there."
01:47:31;01:47:35;"From 1984 to 2016, we still love a good movie soundtrack."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"This is by 21 Pilots."

01:48:58;01:49:00;"know better than to be like,"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"the song's called Suicide Squad."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"So we'd love it if you could write a song"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"called Suicide Squad."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"- Right."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"- Maybe a chorus that's like the whole squad"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"is ready to suicide."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"You know, the people don't do that anymore,"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"but they still will probably be like,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"hey guys, so the movie's Suicide Squad."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"It's very dark."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"In this movie, the heroes are villains."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Like we don't wanna tell you how to write the song,"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"but like we're definitely looking for something"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"that captures a kind of dark."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- Minor key."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"- Moody, yeah."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"All my friends are heathens, villains, whatever."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"They did their thing, got nothing against the song."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"Not great."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"I'll admit, I like some other 21 Pilots songs."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- I'm still getting my head around 21 Pilots"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"'cause I've only heard a few songs."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"It's a weird combination of influences."
01:49:39;01:49:43;"- Seems like part Radiohead, part Eminem."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- I don't think a lot of people are throwing out Radiohead."
01:49:44;01:49:46;"- The way he breaks to that falsetto,"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"it's like very like Tom Yorke."
01:49:48;01:49:49;"- Oh yeah, okay, I can see that."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"- Like they definitely are Radiohead heads."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"- I think there's also the emo part"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"that you're forgetting about."
01:49:55;01:49:59;"Like the panic at the disco, Fallout Boy."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"- Right, that's a whole movement."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- You missed out on that."
01:50:02;01:50:02;"- Completely."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"When you say emo, I think of like Fugazi or something."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"- Yeah, no."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"- Not that."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Fugazi at the Olympics, no that."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"(laughing)"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"- Well that wraps up the top five."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"I think, it was a close one, but I think 84 pulled it out."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"84 has two Stone Cold classics."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"It's always hard to compare."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"- Very rare."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"- It's hard to compare Stone Cold classics to anything new."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"We just don't know."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Will any of these 2016 songs become Stone Cold classics?"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"- Unlikely, but possible."
01:50:28;01:50:31;"- Man, weirdly I think the best one is the Chainsmokers."

01:50:55;01:50:57;"and I hope for your sake that you realize"
01:50:57;01:50:58;"the Olympics are still going on."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"So even though you missed the opening ceremony,"
01:51:01;01:51:04;"you missed fencing, you missed a lot of the swimming"

01:51:11;01:51:12;"- Basketball."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"- Marathon, that's intense."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"- Yeah man."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"- That's a great event."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"- That's crazy, they run for 26 miles man."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"- Mind blowing."
01:51:19;01:51:22;"- And that's the original Olympic sport."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"So a lot of stuff to come,"
01:51:23;01:51:26;"so I hope you can take off your hater hat for a second"
01:51:26;01:51:29;"and get a little caught up in Olympics fever."
