01:16;01:19;"Time Crisis back again. Dog Days of Summer."
01:19;01:23;"Yeah, this might be a banked episode. How banked is it?"
01:23;01:27;"I don't know. Anywhere between one to five weeks."
01:27;01:31;"Nothing crazy. It's not like some unearthed years old."
01:31;01:36;"It's a Summer of 2022 episode. Feel great about it."
01:36;01:38;"Yeah. Back in person. And we're back in person."
01:38;01:42;"That's why we bank these ups. We're not always in the same place when we are."
01:42;01:46;"Get together, do a tight banking session. Feels good."
01:46;01:50;"Got the whole crew. Sunday morning."
01:50;01:54;"That's right. It is a Sunday morning. Got Nick and Seinfeld."
01:54;01:57;"How you guys doing? Hey, what's up?"
01:57;02:02;"Seinfeld was lost in thought. No, no, I'm good."
02:02;02:05;"I'm good. I'm glad to see you guys again in person."
02:05;02:08;"You just sitting here wearing a large print Kramer shirt?"
02:08;02:12;"It's an all over print Kramer shirt. I'm just trying to stay on brand for you guys."
02:12;02:18;"That's a great shirt. Thank you. When you're rolling out with wearing like the giant Kramer shirt,"
02:18;02:21;"what type of comments are you getting? Mostly Seinfeld fans"
02:21;02:26;"or does anybody people still want to bring up the Laugh Factory thing?"
02:26;02:36;"Or is it we just live in a modern isolated world where even a sick all over print Kramer shirt is not eliciting comments from strangers?"
02:36;02:38;"Yeah, I think you know, I've worn this in the past."
02:38;02:41;"I've gotten a couple of like nice shirt like standard stock compliments,"
02:41;02:44;"but I mean today I went right from the house right here."
02:44;02:48;"So I mean this would be the first compliment of the day on the shirt."
02:48;02:52;"Did you make the round your wife or son say anything about it?"
02:52;02:55;"My wife was like she's like, oh you're wearing the Kramer shirt."
02:55;02:57;"Like that was just a neutral like acknowledgement."
02:57;03:02;"And your son said, daddy, daddy, you're wearing my favorite shirt again."
03:02;03:10;"She's like who's that racist on your shirt? No, but you know, the day is young."
03:10;03:13;"Okay, Nick, you're wearing some kind of weird shirt too."
03:13;03:17;"What's this? Dewey Crumpler X Cushion Works."
03:17;03:20;"Yes, some weird art thing. Do you know who this is Jake?"
03:20;03:24;"So Cushion Works, he's come up on the show a couple times."
03:24;03:31;"My friend Jordan Stein, mutual friend, childhood friend, runs a gallery,"
03:31;03:34;"a small gallery in San Francisco."
03:34;03:39;"Yep. And Dewey Crumpler is an artist that was featured in his gallery."
03:39;03:43;"And he did he's sort of a does a lot of weird kind of New Age space stuff."
03:43;03:46;"And this is there any way Dewey Crumpler is his real name?"
03:46;03:50;"I'm like 50/50 on it. I think it's a hundred percent. His real name?"
03:50;03:51;"I'm certain about it. It's a great name."
03:51;03:55;"Those are both real. Dewey, I've heard of it."
03:55;03:58;"I've heard there's Dewey Cox. Well, he's a fictional character."
03:58;04:01;"Decimal System. Dewey Decimal and Crumpler."
04:01;04:04;"I do that is a real last name. You put them together."
04:04;04:06;"It does sound a little bit like a nom de plume."
04:06;04:12;"I don't want to show my ignorance, but Dewey Decimal? Is his last name Decimal?"
04:12;04:16;"No, no, because there's decimals in the system."
04:16;04:20;"Yeah. No, it's just books. No, his name is Dewey Decimal."
04:20;04:24;"And he said, let's just organize these books by alphabetically."
04:24;04:28;"I understand. He was the first librarian to organize books alphabetically."
04:28;04:31;"No. Yeah. What's his name? Let's get a number crunch on that."
04:31;04:35;"His name is probably John Dewey, Augustus Dewey. Not a first name."
04:35;04:39;"Sam Dewey. Published by Melville Dewey. Melville Dewey."
04:39;04:43;"Wow. That's a very. That sounds like Dewey Crumpler. It's very academic sounding."
04:43;04:47;"But who else do you know whose first name is Dewey? Is that a nickname for like?"
04:47;04:51;"Dewey Cox. Yeah, no, but yeah, a fictional, a real person named Dewey."
04:51;04:55;"I had a great uncle named Dewey. Wow. I didn't know him very well,"
04:55;04:59;"but it was a nickname. I'm pretty sure. Maybe his name was like Donald or something."
04:59;05:04;"Deward. It's a male name of Welsh origin that means beloved."
05:04;05:08;"All right, Dewey Crumpler. So Dewey Crumpler, this is a. Great name."
05:08;05:13;"Yeah, it's a great name and he's a great artist and it's a great gallery."
05:13;05:15;"Cushion Works. Cushion Works is a gallery."
05:15;05:19;"Everybody's wearing t-shirts today. And well, yeah, I'm rocking."
05:19;05:22;"Free your mind. I don't think I ever wore this before. I saw it."
05:22;05:24;"I pulled it out of my closet, said free your mind on it."
05:24;05:28;"And my first thought was, oh, that's some Diplo thing."
05:28;05:31;"I've got a lot of good things from the Diplo promotional world over the years."
05:31;05:35;"I remember once there was some sort of like Adidas collab"
05:35;05:39;"and it came in this like amazing box, which included a record player."
05:39;05:43;"It was like a cheap record player built into a cardboard case."
05:43;05:49;"And then I know at some point I had a bottle of Diplo branded tequila"
05:49;05:51;"that we worked through slowly over a year."
05:51;05:53;"Anyway, so I pulled this out. I thought it was a Diplo thing and I looked on the back"
05:53;05:56;"and I was incorrect. It's Throwing Fits."
05:56;06:00;"It's a pod? It's a pod. Yeah, it's a fashion pod, which I went on a few years ago."
06:00;06:03;"Great pod, primarily about fashion."
06:03;06:06;"But so this is some kind of Throwing Fits thing."
06:06;06:09;"And Jake's shirt is a great lead in to this episode."
06:09;06:14;"It's official Jokerman podcast. I'm also wearing a podcast t-shirt."
06:14;06:16;"Oh, yeah. Official Jokerman podcast merch."
06:16;06:20;"It's a great shirt. It has, starting with self-portrait,"
06:20;06:23;"I guess it lists all of Bob Dylan's 70s albums"
06:23;06:26;"and has the kind of the logo of each album."
06:26;06:30;"So it's got like the Planet Waves handwritten scrawl,"
06:30;06:32;"blood on the tracks with the lines, the basement tapes,"
06:32;06:35;"that kind of a diagonal writing."
06:35;06:40;"And then at the bottom it says Jokerman in Jokerman font."
06:40;06:42;"Shout out to Jokerman pod. Great pod."
06:42;06:44;"It is a great pod. I got on there twice."
06:44;06:47;"I got into it recently and actually listened to your episode with Dave."
06:47;06:49;"Oh, fun. Which I really enjoyed."
06:49;06:52;"After seeing Bob Dylan at the Pantages, I've been on this big Bob Dylan thing"
06:52;06:56;"and finally started listening to Jokerman because I've been hearing about it."
06:56;07:00;"Yeah, I vaguely remember maybe something about them and I finally listened."
07:00;07:04;"It's a great pod. Just in time for them to move on to Velvet Underground."
07:04;07:07;"But the material is still there and the content is still there."
07:07;07:09;"There's two years of Bob Dylan pods."
07:09;07:17;"Yep. And also I was on the Wikipedia page for the song Jokerman, as I often am."
07:17;07:19;"I don't know if I've said this before. I saw it and I forgot it."
07:19;07:24;"But I was very proud, as you should also be Jake, especially you,"
07:24;07:27;"to be, you know, reading like, yeah, Jokerman."
07:27;07:29;"You're kind of like, yeah, is there any interesting anecdotes"
07:29;07:32;"about when it was written or analysis on the Wikipedia page?"
07:32;07:36;"And then on the bottom, there's a part on Wikipedia where it talks about"
07:36;07:38;"in popular culture and like who's covered it."
07:38;07:43;"And then somewhere it says the Jokerman font is named after the song."
07:43;07:45;"And I was curious. I was like, well, I think we broke this story."
07:45;07:49;"So I'm curious what the citation is going to be."
07:49;07:52;"Right. And I looked and it was Time Crisis."
07:52;07:55;"That rules. Because we interviewed the creator of the Jokerman font."
07:55;08:00;"We confirmed it. That's probably our greatest scoop ever here."
08:00;08:03;"That's real original journalism."
08:03;08:06;"Yeah. You had a hunch. You tracked it down. You confirmed."
08:06;08:10;"I feel like maybe it was your hunch. Well, either way, it was a team effort."
08:10;08:12;"Team effort. And I think about stuff like that because that's exactly the stuff"
08:12;08:15;"that I as a music fan want to know."
08:15;08:17;"And I think about at random times we've done interviews."
08:17;08:20;"It doesn't always pan out, but you know, when you're like talking like Huey Lewis"
08:20;08:22;"or something, be like, man, you ever listen to the dead?"
08:22;08:25;"You just never know when somebody is going to say something,"
08:25;08:27;"which one day somebody is interested in Huey Lewis."
08:27;08:31;"Because this is exactly the type of stuff that we wonder off the mic."
08:31;08:35;"A hundred percent. Yeah. Even if we didn't do this show, it would be the exact same."
08:35;08:39;"We're the type of people who are sitting around listening to music one day"
08:39;08:42;"and just thinking, I wonder what Lou Reed had to say about the Grateful Dead."
08:42;08:47;"Luckily there, there's quite a bit. Ample information."
08:47;08:51;"Yeah. Or just like thinking about like, did Jerry ever,"
08:51;08:55;"I don't know, you know, listen to Pink Floyd? Yes. The answer is yes."
08:55;08:58;"Or, you know, you love. What did Jerry think of Van Halen?"
08:58;09:00;"Yes. Those kind of things. Yeah, exactly."
09:00;09:02;"That, you know, people that were contemporaries of each other,"
09:02;09:07;"but acts that you didn't associate in your, like that no one associates in their minds."
09:07;09:12;"And probably nine times out of ten, the answer is going to be something along lines of either,"
09:12;09:17;"not for me or oh, yeah, that's cool. You know, which maybe is not going to be that interesting."
09:17;09:21;"But even if we got like Bob Weir back on the show and said,"
09:21;09:23;"Bob, we forgot to ask you last time."
09:23;09:25;"What were you thinking when you first heard Van Halen?"
09:25;09:28;"He might just be like, I thought it was pretty cool, pretty far out."
09:28;09:30;"Not exactly my scene, but you know, good stuff."
09:30;09:33;"It might be that, but you never know if there might be something. Incredible technique."
09:33;09:36;"Yeah, there might be some really interesting."
09:36;09:39;"And in some ways, sometimes all you want to know is that."
09:39;09:41;"And of course, people's opinions change."
09:41;09:45;"So you might find some quote from back in the day of like,"
09:45;09:51;"like I said, there's something about Lou Reed saying that Frank Zappa was like the biggest loser he'd ever met in his life."
09:51;09:54;"And apparently like later in life, he was like, no, he's cool."
09:54;09:58;"Great musician. You know, people get a quote from Lou Reed."
09:58;10:02;"If there is a quote on Metallica circa 1985."
10:02;10:07;"Oh, yeah. If he was in or not. Absolute dog."
10:07;10:11;"Terrible tone, terrible distortion tone."
10:11;10:15;"I'd hate to be in the same room as these guys."
10:16;10:22;"I'm going away. I'm your source of self-destruction."
10:22;10:26;"Faded, pumped with fear. Stuck in dark is clear."
10:26;10:30;"Kneeling on your death's construction."
10:30;10:35;"Take me, you will see. For it's all you need."
10:35;10:43;"Dedicated to power killing you."
10:43;10:48;"Controlling master."
10:48;10:52;"Obey your master."
10:52;10:57;"Your life burns faster."
10:57;11:01;"Obey your master."
11:01;11:04;"Master of puppets and pulling your strings."
11:04;11:10;"I always think about that too, back to Bob Dylan, because I remember reading an interview with somebody,"
11:10;11:14;"probably Cameron Crowe, somebody who was like writing for Rolling Stone in the 70s."
11:14;11:19;"And whoever the journalist was talked about profiling Bob in,"
11:19;11:23;"I guess probably, you know, 77, 76, whatever."
11:23;11:26;"And they talked about going to visit him at a hotel room."
11:26;11:30;"And he just gone down to the record shop just to like, you know, see what was up."
11:30;11:33;"And he had this huge spread of records on the bed."
11:33;11:38;"One of which was the debut album from the Sex Pistols, Nevermind the Books."
11:38;11:42;"And I remember the interviewer recounting this later saying,"
11:42;11:46;"I was so nervous and I felt like I had to ask him about his tour and his new album."
11:46;11:51;"And it always kills me that I didn't specifically say, what do you think of that one, Bob?"
11:51;11:55;"You listen to it? Yeah. Now we may never know. Bob's a mysterious figure."
11:55;11:56;"You know, if he wants to talk about it, he will."
11:56;12:01;"But I don't know if he's ever had any commentary on punk rock. Really?"
12:01;12:06;"Never? All right, Sunfeld, start digging. Has Bob Dylan ever talked about?"
12:06;12:12;"Because he famously likes to drop these little breadcrumbs that shows that he's, he knows what's going on."
12:12;12:17;"Like he had a very, like a late era song where he talks about Alicia Keys in the lyrics."
12:17;12:20;"Oh, wow. Interesting. Oh, yeah, I remember that."
12:20;12:24;"But there's also a video I've seen a few times on Instagram."
12:24;12:27;"Maybe like John Wurster will post it every now and then,"
12:27;12:32;"which it's Bob Dylan on the street in like the early 80s."
12:32;12:34;"And the kids are talking about the bands they're into."
12:34;12:37;"And he's like, you into rat? His kids? No, no, no."
12:37;12:39;"It's just like random children. Oh, OK."
12:39;12:43;"Who are just like playing in the neighborhood. And Bob asks them that? Or they ask Bob?"
12:43;12:46;"He asks them. He says, you into rat? Yeah, are you into rat?"
12:46;12:49;"Oh, yeah, they're all right. Try to find that. Whoa."
12:49;12:52;"Yeah. And it's sort of like, oh, whoa."
12:52;12:57;"He's like following like early mid 80s, like heavy metal."
12:57;13:04;"Right. I mean, and I guess why wouldn't he? But yeah, you'd like to imagine Bob's like in his early 40s."
13:04;13:06;"You know, it's probably very confusing time for him. It makes sense."
13:06;13:10;"And following music in the 80s, but at some point I bet he fully tapped out."
13:10;13:16;"Although Alicia Keys. Right. So that was like late 90s or early 2000s."
13:16;13:21;"I mean, it's like has Bob heard the Strokes? I want to say yes."
13:21;13:25;"He's heard of them. Has Bob heard Vampire?"
13:25;13:29;"Hmm. Maybe check out our cover of Joker, man."
13:29;13:32;"I seem to remember we needed his permission once."
13:32;13:34;"You don't need permission to just cover a song in a concert."
13:34;13:37;"I think it's because we did a version of it on Jimmy Kimmel."
13:37;13:42;"So we needed permission. So at some point it went to his manager."
13:42;13:51;"I read a funny story about Bob that he was talking to like Axl Rose or some member of Guns N' Roses"
13:51;13:56;"because they famously covered Knocking on Heaven's Door on Use Your Illusion."
13:56;13:59;"But before that, they would bust it out in concert sometimes."
13:59;14:03;"So if you were ahead, you knew that Guns N' Roses liked that Bob Dylan song"
14:03;14:08;"and would cover it sometimes. And I guess before they actually laid it to tape,"
14:08;14:12;"Bob had run into them somewhere, maybe Axl."
14:12;14:19;"And as Axl recounted it, Bob said, ""Hey, when you going to record your cover of Knocking on Heaven's Door?"""
14:19;14:25;"And apparently said something like, ""Oh, like you want us to?"" And he said, ""I just want the money."""
14:25;14:31;"And they're like, ""Uh, alright."" You could totally see him kind of like maybe half meaning it"
14:31;14:36;"but also enjoying like f***ing with a young artist or maybe like hazing them just like,"
14:36;14:41;"""Young fellas, you get that cover to tape. Make a little money for your OG."""
14:41;14:44;"Oh my God. Should we listen to that?"
14:44;14:45;"To the Guns... G&R?"
14:45;14:47;"G&R version?"
14:47;14:48;"Yeah, sure."
14:48;14:50;"I haven't heard this G&R version in a long time."
14:52;14:55;"So this is from Use Your Illusion 2."
14:55;15:02;"Bob got the CD, listened to the first like 30 seconds just to make sure he's like,"
15:02;15:04;"""Alright, watch the money rolling."""
15:04;15:10;"Well, it ended up being a kind of a big single for them, I think."
15:10;15:14;"Yeah, this is like one of their biggest songs in a way."
15:14;15:21;"I like Axl's interpretation at the beginning."

18:29;18:34;"So, like the money rolling in. And then here's another good one."
18:34;18:36;"Wait, hold on, I just gotta see what's..."

19:18;19:21;"I mean, I bet this version of this song was a bigger hit"
19:21;19:24;"than any song that Bob Dylan ever released."
19:24;19:26;"Yeah, just in terms of, like, pure numbers."
19:26;19:31;"He never had, like, huge smash hits, as far as I know."
19:31;19:36;"My impression of his career was very album-oriented."
19:36;19:38;"Yeah, I mean, he's got his..."

19:40;19:42;"'Blown in the Wind' was, like, covered many times."

19:47;19:50;"Probably more people have heard GNR knocking on Heaven's Door"

19:53;19:58;"I do remember reading, I think when I was prepping for"
19:58;20:00;"one of my two Joker metaphors,"
20:00;20:03;"because I went on and did a 'Planet Waves' episode,"
20:03;20:06;"I remember being very surprised to read that 'Planet Waves'"
20:06;20:08;"was his first number one album."
20:08;20:09;"1974."
20:09;20:12;"It's the first album of his that ever just, like, started number one."
20:12;20:14;"Yeah, it might just be, like, luck of the draw."
20:14;20:17;"Because I'm sure his other albums must have been"
20:17;20:19;"debuting at number two or three."
20:19;20:21;"Here we go. We got a little information here."
20:21;20:23;"Bob Dylan on the Billboard charts."
20:23;20:26;"Number one, 'Knocking on Heaven's Door', 1973."
20:26;20:28;"Peaked at number 12."
20:28;20:30;"16 weeks on the chart."
20:30;20:32;"Number two, 'Lay, Lady, Lay', 1969."
20:32;20:35;"Number seven, 'Like a Rolling Stone', 1965."
20:35;20:36;"Number two."
20:36;20:37;"Okay, that's pretty..."
20:37;20:39;"I didn't realize that 'Like a Rolling Stone'"
20:39;20:41;"was actually a huge hit at the time."
20:41;20:42;"I think that was, like, a big moment."
20:42;20:45;"But also back then, I feel like things would just, like,"
20:45;20:47;"fall off the charts so quick."
20:47;20:48;"Gotta serve somebody."
20:48;20:50;"Number 24, 1979."
20:50;20:52;"That's cool."
20:52;20:53;"Where's the JFK ballad?"
20:53;20:54;"Oh, 'Murder Most Foul'?"
20:54;20:58;"That was probably number one on the adult contemporary charts."
20:58;21:00;"Probably not Billboard, maybe streaming."
21:00;21:02;"Did it do big numbers on streaming?"
21:02;21:03;"No."
21:03;21:04;"Oh, I thought it did."
21:04;21:07;"I just think Bob Dylan's audience is..."
21:07;21:10;"So many people are probably still buying CDs"
21:10;21:13;"or not using streaming to take it down."
21:13;21:17;"Bob Dylan has only one number one song"
21:17;21:19;"on any Billboard singles chart."
21:19;21:22;"And it's on the Rock Digital Songs sales chart."
21:22;21:23;"That's a mouthful."
21:23;21:24;"And it's a 'Murder Most Foul'."
21:24;21:26;"That was number one on the Rock Digital sales chart?"
21:26;21:29;"According to Nielsen, sold 10,000 downloads"
21:29;21:32;"between its release and April 2nd."
21:32;21:33;"Oh."
21:33;21:34;"Respectable."
21:34;21:35;"Interesting."
21:35;21:38;"I wonder how Vampire's done on the Rock Digital sales chart."
21:38;21:39;"Gotta get a number crunch."
21:39;21:42;"What's the best we ever did on the Rock Digital sales chart?"
21:42;21:46;"So that's like older heads buying the song for $1.29."
21:46;21:47;"Yep."
21:47;21:48;"I did not buy it."
21:48;21:49;"I streamed it."
21:49;21:51;"It's the most important chart."
21:51;21:53;"Rock Digital sales chart!"
21:53;21:55;"We're number one at RDS."
21:55;21:56;"What's that?"
21:56;21:58;"What's that stand for?"
21:58;21:59;"We just leveled up."
21:59;22:01;"Number one at RDS."
22:01;22:04;"And it's probably a chart that won't exist that much longer."
22:04;22:07;"I'm sad to say because we're clearly in the streaming era."
22:07;22:13;"And eventually all we'll have left is vinyl collectors and streamers."
22:13;22:17;"And the good men and women who've been holding down the RDS chart"
22:17;22:19;"all these years."
22:19;22:20;"All right."
22:20;22:22;"Will just vanish like sand in the wind."
22:22;22:24;"Okay, Vampire Weekend."
22:24;22:26;"I don't even know how to read this properly."
22:26;22:30;"It looks like you've had six songs that have hit the Rock Digital song sales chart."
22:30;22:32;"Six songs on the RDS."
22:32;22:37;"Holiday, Five Weeks, Diane Young, Five Weeks, Horchata, Two,"
22:37;22:42;"Unbeliever's Harmony, Harmony Hall, Giving Up The Gun, all spent one week."
22:42;22:44;"So Holiday, I wouldn't have guessed."
22:44;22:47;"Holiday did five weeks on the RDS."
22:47;22:48;"The RDSC."
22:48;22:53;"Harmony Hall was the highest peaking song at number 10."
22:53;22:54;"Top 10."
22:55;22:56;"Top 10 at RDS."
22:56;22:58;"Hey, it might not be Bob Dylan, but we were in top 10 at RDS."
22:58;23:00;"So what did that sell, like 800 copies?"
23:00;23:03;"They're probably not going to give you the actual stats on the Billboard website."
23:03;23:05;"Yeah, this is very top line."
23:05;23:06;"I think you're probably right."
23:06;23:12;"You probably had to sell like 800 digital songs to make it on."
23:12;23:16;"I mean, I get these charts every now and then."
23:16;23:20;"And the digital sales are low, but I still am always like,"
23:20;23:25;"maybe because the numbers are so low, they're almost more meaningful."
23:25;23:29;"I feel like, you know, once in a blue moon, I'll get some sales chart that'll be like,"
23:29;23:32;"yeah, like for instance, like Harmony Hall last week and just be like,"
23:32;23:35;"35 people bought it."
23:35;23:38;"We've bought the song Harmony Hall last week."
23:38;23:40;"And then you're like really thinking about it."
23:40;23:43;"In a way, this might sound like coke, but it's true."
23:43;23:46;"In a way, if they're just like 100,000 people bought it, you know,"
23:46;23:49;"you're like the weekend, you just be like, just another day in LA."
23:49;23:55;"But for me, I'm like, when you're just like 35 people bought like Harmony Hall"
23:55;23:57;"and these numbers, maybe it's even lower than that."
23:57;24:00;"I don't know, for digital sales, because obviously the vast majority of the"
24:00;24:03;"quote unquote sales comes from streaming."
24:03;24:07;"And you see these numbers, like 35 people bought it, a song like that digital last week,"
24:07;24:09;"three years after the album came out."
24:09;24:11;"I mean, I've probably said this before, even back in the day,"
24:11;24:15;"even before streaming, when you get these sales charts,"
24:15;24:17;"and I always have gotten them sporadically,"
24:17;24:21;"which maybe is for the best to not obsess like every single week."
24:21;24:24;"But it's always interesting when you get a sales chart,"
24:24;24:26;"and the old ones used to say regionally."
24:26;24:27;"That was sick."
24:27;24:28;"Oh, that's tight."
24:28;24:31;"Because like when we were on Excel or something,"
24:31;24:35;"you know, it'd say it'd be like Modern Vampires, it's like 2013."
24:35;24:37;"And, you know, the album just came out,"
24:37;24:38;"they're talking about how that album's doing."
24:38;24:41;"And then they'll say like, oh, and by the way, here's like the other two."
24:41;24:42;"And then you just get like the first album."
24:42;24:46;"And it would sometimes literally just be like, did 70 in St. Louis last week."
24:46;24:48;"And then you really, you start thinking about it."
24:48;24:50;"Don't quote me on these numbers, by the way."
24:50;24:52;"But then you really think about it, because you're like, wow,"
24:52;24:56;"five years after this record came out, like 70 people this week in St. Louis"
24:56;24:58;"decided to buy it."
24:58;24:59;"It's interesting."
24:59;25:00;"That's a real bump."
25:00;25:02;"I mean, I'm not quoting you on the numbers, but I mean."
25:02;25:03;"Yeah."
25:03;25:06;"I'm thinking about you getting these numbers every week,"
25:06;25:10;"and Rashida just being like, hey, can you come to bed?"
25:10;25:13;"And you're just in your office, just pouring over."
25:13;25:14;"I'm just looking at like."
25:14;25:16;"70 in Minnesota."
25:16;25:18;"I've got to enter the data into the Excel spreadsheet."
25:18;25:22;"No, I'm just like, we're, I might be reading this incorrectly,"
25:22;25:27;"but I think we only did 12 in St. Louis last week on Contra."
25:27;25:31;"We got to stop buying organic produce, babe."
25:31;25:36;"It'd be nice if you got a notification on your phone every time somebody bought a digital."
25:36;25:37;"Oh, that'd be chill."
25:37;25:39;"Yeah, just like a text message."
25:39;25:40;"That would drive somebody insane."
25:40;25:42;"I mean, that's why social media drives people insane,"
25:42;25:47;"because it is kind of the equivalent of getting a notification every time you sell a record."
27:04;27:07;"It's so funny that the charts include both of these things,"
27:07;27:10;"because streaming is so passive."
27:10;27:12;"Even if you're like barely doing numbers,"
27:12;27:15;"you could easily just get thousands and thousands of streams a week."
27:15;27:18;"They divide it by 1500."
27:18;27:19;"I don't know if people know that."
27:19;27:21;"That's kind of an interesting fact."
27:21;27:26;"The way that they calculate sales now is that if somebody buys a record, that's one record,"
27:26;27:32;"but you would need 1500 streams of songs from the album to count for one sale."
27:32;27:34;"Like how much is an album now?"
27:34;27:35;"How much does it cost?"
27:35;27:36;"Yeah."
27:36;27:38;"If you bought, if you bought the album."
27:38;27:41;"If you bought it on iTunes, it'd be probably still $9.99."
27:41;27:47;"If you bought the vinyl, that could cost anything from 20 to 40 bucks to buy the CD."
27:47;27:48;"I don't know, 12 bucks."
27:48;27:51;"Digital album, 10 bucks."
27:51;27:53;"That equals 1500 streams."
27:53;27:59;"Let's say you got people to, your album produced 15 million streams,"
27:59;28:02;"which is like really a lot when you think about it."
28:02;28:08;"That could be, you know, that could be 50, I guess, I don't know."
28:08;28:11;"Let's say your album produced 150 million streams."
28:11;28:12;"Right."
28:12;28:16;"Because that could mean like millions of people listened multiple times."
28:16;28:17;"Sure."
28:17;28:20;"What's 150 million divided by 1500?"
28:20;28:22;"I guess we're just cutting off two zeros."
28:22;28:24;"So 150,000?"
28:24;28:25;"Wait."
28:25;28:29;"150 million divided by 1500 is 100,000."
28:29;28:30;"100,000."
28:30;28:31;"That's just something to think about."
28:31;28:32;"It's pretty wild."
28:32;28:33;"That's an insane metric."
28:33;28:38;"It's saying that you'd have to listen to every song on the album 150 times."
28:38;28:43;"That's pretty rare to listen to an album all the way through 150 times."
28:43;28:45;"Well, I guess, and that's streams."
28:45;28:46;"Most people are not doing that."
28:46;28:50;"So it's really more like listening to the album 15 times."
28:50;28:53;"No, because if the song is like, let's say,"
28:53;28:55;"well, I guess it depends how many songs are on the record."
28:55;28:57;"I'm talking about counting for an album."
28:57;28:58;"Right."
28:58;29:00;"So you'd have to listen to the album."
29:00;29:04;"Let's say for just to keep it simple, people loving this on-air math."
29:04;29:07;"Let's say to keep it simple, you made a 15-track album."
29:07;29:08;"Yeah."
29:08;29:11;"You'd have to listen to it 100 times all the way through."
29:11;29:12;"That's a lot."
29:12;29:19;"Let's say that 1 million people listen to a 15-track album 10 times."
29:19;29:20;"I feel good about this math."
29:20;29:27;"You got 1 million red-blooded Americans to listen to your 15-track album 10 times each."
29:27;29:30;"Well, that's the equivalent of selling 100,000 records,"
29:30;29:33;"which is really good, but there still is something about it"
29:33;29:36;"where it's just those numbers are just so gargantuan."
29:36;29:41;"And you're only a fifth of the way to a gold record at that point."
29:41;29:43;"You're only a tenth of the way to platinum."
29:43;29:47;"So even that getting a million people to listen 10 times to your 15-track record,"
29:47;29:50;"if you want to be going platinum in this day and age,"
29:50;29:55;"you got to make it a little more like 10 million, 30 million people doing that."
29:55;30:01;"Well, I'm glad Bob could at least score some points on the rock digital sales chart."
30:01;30:02;"That's right."
30:02;30:03;"I mean..."
30:03;30:05;"And also, he's a career artist, man."
30:05;30:08;"Does Bob have a dark side of the moon?"
30:08;30:10;"Of course not."
30:10;30:16;"But you add up his 39 studio albums and his many, many live albums."
30:16;30:20;"Because you also see some stuff like Dylan in the Dead."
30:20;30:24;"Not a well-regarded live record, but Dylan in the Dead."
30:24;30:28;"I believe it's seven tracks, pretty random assortment of songs."
30:28;30:30;"That one randomly went platinum in the late '80s."
30:30;30:31;"That's perfect."
30:31;30:33;"And then you go global."
30:33;30:36;"Of course, Bob's a gargantuan, important artist."
30:36;30:41;"But even for Bob, those GNR checks were substantial enough."
30:41;30:45;"Yeah, he doesn't have his accountant calling Vampire Weekend and saying,"
30:45;30:48;"""Thanks for covering Joker Man on Jimmy Kimmel."""
30:48;30:53;"Earlier in the show, you'd asked about Bob Dylan's relationship to punk."
30:53;30:54;"It's interesting."
30:54;31:00;"When he was on Letterman for the first time in 1984, he performed Joker Man."
31:00;31:01;"With the plugs."
31:01;31:02;"Have we talked about this?"
31:02;31:07;"With Charlie Quintana from Social Distortion and Tony Marcico from the plugs?"
31:07;31:11;"Actually, that version is the theme song of the podcast, Joker Man."
31:11;31:14;"He did kind of like a punk version of it."
31:14;31:17;"So maybe he was at least aware of those guys."
31:17;31:20;"But you want to know almost that step beyond where just like,"
31:20;31:24;"""Has Bob ever spent significant time with London Calling by The Clash?"""
31:24;31:25;"Yeah, Elvis Costello."
31:25;31:30;"Are you familiar with the Thunders song, ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory?"""
31:30;31:31;"Oh, Johnny Thunders."
31:31;31:32;"Yeah, sure, sure."
31:32;31:33;"You're right."
31:33;31:37;"So apparently, according to an interview with Sid Silvain from New York Dolls,"
31:37;31:42;"Bob Dylan told Johnny that he wished he'd written that song."
31:42;31:43;"Okay."
31:43;31:45;"Does that do anything for you guys?"
31:45;31:46;"It does a lot."
31:46;31:47;"No, that's significant."
31:47;31:49;"Bob Dylan was aware of the Johnny Thunders song,"
31:49;31:51;"""You Can't Put Your Arm Around a Memory."""
31:51;31:52;"I believe that."
31:52;31:53;"And he wished he wrote it."
31:53;31:54;"Yeah."
31:54;31:56;"It's kind of thirdhand the way they've written it here."
31:56;31:57;"It's definitely not confirmed."
31:57;31:58;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
31:58;32:00;"The most interesting part of that to me is that--"
32:00;32:02;"Bob's like, ""I never said that sh*t."""
32:02;32:05;"--is that we know how Jake feels about the New York Dolls."
32:05;32:06;"Yeah, Jake, not a fan."
32:06;32:12;"If that's the only song that Dylan wishes he wrote in the genre of punk,"
32:12;32:13;"I think that's interesting."
32:13;32:15;"That is interesting."
32:15;32:18;"I got a little pushback in my New York Dolls skepticism."
32:18;32:21;"Online or in the room?"
32:21;32:23;"Online, which is fine."
32:23;32:24;"Very mild."
32:24;32:28;"I think one guy was just like, ""Get your act together, dude."""
32:28;32:30;"Jake's more of a Goo Goo Dolls guy."
32:30;32:31;"You're right."
32:31;32:34;"Well, no, it was in the context of the Rock Hall."
32:34;32:35;"Right, right."
32:35;32:36;"What did you say?"
32:36;32:38;"They don't deserve to be in the Hall?"
32:38;32:39;"I mean, we were going through it--"
32:39;32:42;"I was on this kick of like, ""Everyone should get in."""
32:42;32:43;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
32:43;32:44;"You know?"
32:44;32:46;"But then we got to New York Dolls, and I was like,"
32:46;32:50;"""Okay, they're one of those bands that you see their name checked a lot."""
32:50;32:53;"But I was sort of like, ""What is-- Do they have the catalog?"
32:53;32:55;"What is the catalog?"""
32:55;32:57;"Coming from a place of ignorance a little bit here,"
32:57;32:59;"I haven't done my due diligence."
32:59;33:01;"I know they're a famous band."
33:01;33:05;"I know they're a band that has an important historic role in punk,"
33:05;33:08;"pre-punk, proto-punk, pre-punk."
33:08;33:11;"[laughter]"
33:11;33:15;"But, you know, I think we threw on the top New York Dolls song."
33:15;33:16;"You weren't feeling it."
33:16;33:17;"Somebody clapped back."
33:17;33:18;"You got clapped back on Twitter?"
33:18;33:19;"Somebody DM'd you?"
33:19;33:20;"Something."
33:20;33:22;"You don't f--- with the Dolls?"
33:22;33:23;"Gugu?"
33:23;33:24;"Burn in hell."
33:24;33:26;"[laughter]"
33:26;33:28;"So as people can tell, this is going to be a Bob Dylan episode."
33:28;33:30;"But, you know, hopefully we'll talk about some other stuff."
33:30;33:33;"But we're going to be getting into his greatest hits, Volume 3,"
33:33;33:36;"which is the perfect place to start with Bob Dylan."
33:36;33:37;"But I wanted to say one other thing,"
33:37;33:41;"just thinking about Bob and his awareness of what's going on."
33:41;33:42;"Clearly, he's fairly aware,"
33:42;33:46;"but I just remembered this interview that was posted on his website,"
33:46;33:49;"but it was with a journalist called Bill Flanagan."
33:49;33:52;"This was around the time when he was putting out his covers records,"
33:52;33:54;"whenever that was, five, six years ago."
33:54;33:55;"And this guy's--"
33:55;33:56;"Triplicate?"
33:56;33:58;"Yeah, this is the Triplicate-era interview."
33:58;33:59;"So clearly, Bob okayed the interview,"
33:59;34:01;"and he just felt like, ""Let's cut out the middleman."
34:01;34:04;"I'll host the interview myself on my website,"
34:04;34:07;"talk with a trusted journalist."""
34:07;34:08;"That's that."
34:08;34:10;"So at one point, this guy's asking him about something"
34:10;34:12;"that was called the New Basement Tapes."
34:12;34:16;"The New Basement Tapes, I guess, was a group of musicians"
34:16;34:18;"put together by T-Bone Burnett,"
34:18;34:22;"who finished songs based on old lyrics of Bob's."
34:22;34:24;"This sounds like kind of a fun idea."
34:24;34:26;"What would these songs sound like"
34:26;34:28;"if they'd actually ever been set to music or whatever?"
34:28;34:29;"So this guy asked him about it, and he says,"
34:29;34:31;"""You know, so for the New Basement Tapes,"
34:31;34:34;"T-Bone put together a group with Elvis Costello,"
34:34;34:37;"Rhiannon Giddens, Jim James, Marcus Mumford,"
34:37;34:38;"and Taylor Goldsmith"
34:38;34:41;"to finish songs based on old lyrics of yours."
34:41;34:43;"Did you hear any of those songs?"""
34:43;34:45;"And say, ""I don't remember writing that."""
34:45;34:47;"And then Bob just goes, ""Did you say Taylor Swift?"""
34:47;34:49;"(laughing)"
34:49;34:52;"And the guy goes, ""Taylor Goldsmith."""
34:52;34:54;"And he goes, ""Yeah, okay."
34:54;34:56;"No, I don't remember writing any of those songs."""
34:56;34:57;"(laughing)"
34:57;35:00;"Anyway, but that was like this interesting moment."
35:00;35:02;"And again, I'm sure Bob must've,"
35:02;35:04;"because it was hosted on his website,"
35:04;35:07;"he clearly would've had some degree of control."
35:07;35:09;"Picture an older guy like Bob,"
35:09;35:12;"also just famously savvy, playful."
35:12;35:14;"I mean, he's the Joker man."
35:14;35:15;"So if he wanted to,"
35:15;35:17;"you could picture another older musician"
35:17;35:19;"who would have this moment in an interview"
35:19;35:21;"where somebody says, ""Taylor Goldsmith,"""
35:21;35:23;"and they seem to perk up and go, ""Taylor Swift?"""
35:23;35:24;"And the guy goes, ""No."""
35:24;35:25;"You could see somebody saying,"
35:25;35:27;"""Can you cut that part out"
35:27;35:29;"where I asked about Taylor Swift?"""
35:29;35:31;"At the very least, just 'cause he was wrong."
35:31;35:32;"You could see somebody be like,"
35:32;35:34;"""Just cut that part out where I said,"
35:34;35:36;"'Yeah, I don't know what people are gonna think of that.'"""
35:36;35:38;"And then maybe because he just wants people"
35:38;35:39;"to know that he knows."
35:39;35:41;"I also just can't help thinking,"
35:41;35:43;"because of the GNR story,"
35:43;35:45;"and I don't think any of this takes away from Bob's artistry,"
35:45;35:47;"he's one of the greatest songwriters of all time,"
35:47;35:49;"but just think about him saying to Axl,"
35:49;35:51;"""I don't give a (beep) I just want the money."""
35:51;35:53;"Like maybe he does have this cold-blooded businessman side,"
35:53;35:56;"or maybe it's a mode he has to go into sometimes"
35:56;36:00;"just to like not always be in the sensitive, crazy artist phase."
36:00;36:02;"But there's also some part of me,"
36:02;36:04;"at first when I read that, I thought,"
36:04;36:05;"""Oh, maybe he's like a Taylor Swift fan,"
36:05;36:09;"whereas now I kind of think more like Bob Redd Billboard one day."""
36:09;36:12;"He's like, ""Taylor Swift tour grossed how much?"
36:12;36:15;"Wow! I gotta get out there more."
36:15;36:17;"What? How much is she worth?"""
36:17;36:21;"And then like, I can totally picture that being the last thing on his mind."
36:21;36:23;"And then he's doing this interview, and the guy's like,"
36:23;36:24;"""So all these people covered your songs,"""
36:24;36:26;"and immediately he's thinking like,"
36:26;36:28;"""All right, that'd be a nice little royalty, I guess."""
36:28;36:29;"And he's like listening to the list,"
36:29;36:31;"and he's like, ""Jim James,"" and he's like,"
36:31;36:33;"""Yeah, all right, how much is that?"
36:33;36:36;"Rihanna and Giddens?"" He's like, ""I don't know, a couple thousand bucks."""
36:36;36:38;"He's like, ""Taylor Swift?"" He's like, ""What?"""
36:38;36:39;"[laughter]"
36:39;36:40;"It's like, ""Sht-ting!"""
36:40;36:42;"[laughter]"
36:42;36:43;"Did you say Taylor Swift?"
36:43;36:47;"And he's just like thinking like he's going to build a new pool or something."
36:47;36:49;"And the guy's like, ""Taylor Goldsmith."""
36:49;36:51;"And he's just kind of like, ""Oh."""
36:51;36:52;"Who's that?"
36:52;36:54;"And you could just like see his thought bubble,"
36:54;36:56;"like the new pool just vanishes."
36:56;36:58;"Who's Taylor Goldsmith?"
36:58;37:01;"Oh, from Daws. Okay, yeah, Taylor Goldsmith from Daws."
37:01;37:03;"It goes from a new pool to a new toaster."
37:03;37:06;"[laughter]"
37:06;37:08;"And I mean, why not?"
37:08;37:09;"A nice toaster."
37:09;37:12;"Yeah, I don't think that in any way contradicts Bob's image."
37:12;37:16;"Like sometimes he's like, you know, channeling the muse,"
37:16;37:19;"and sometimes he's just a guy with like a massive catalog"
37:19;37:21;"and a whole bunch of kids."
37:21;37:24;"A sprawling property to maintain in Malibu."
37:24;37:27;"A sprawling property in Tony Malibu."
37:27;37:28;"Got a lot of grandkids."
37:28;37:30;"""Grandpa, your pool sucks."""
37:30;37:32;"[laughter]"
37:32;37:35;"It's not salt water. It's not heated."
37:35;37:39;"He's just got like a kidney-shaped pool from, you know, 1973."
37:39;37:40;"Oh, hell yeah."
37:40;37:43;"But that's why he's also the coolest is that he just like left it in."
37:43;37:44;"He could have cut it out."
37:44;37:48;"He probably appreciated the humor of that moment the same way we do."
37:48;37:51;"Maybe he heard Taylor Goldsmith perfectly clear,"
37:51;37:54;"and he just thought it'd be a funny joke to--Taylor Swift?"
37:54;37:56;"I mean, that does seem like Bob Dylan-type humor, actually."
37:56;37:57;"Yeah."
37:57;37:59;"He was like, ""And Taylor Goldsmith."""
37:59;38:01;"Bob Dylan said, ""Taylor Swift."""
38:01;38:03;"He said no, and he goes, ""Oh, all right."""
38:03;38:06;"So did he hear those recordings or no?"
38:06;38:13;"Okay, so actually Bob specifically gave these additional lyrics to T-Bone"
38:13;38:15;"and tasked him with making this."
38:15;38:16;"So it's okay."
38:16;38:18;"So it's not that passive. He knew."
38:18;38:20;"So you imagine at some point T-Bone probably said,"
38:20;38:22;"""Oh, cool. I'll get a bunch of young musicians."""
38:22;38:26;"He must have at some point just emailed Bob or gave him a call and said like,"
38:26;38:30;"""Hey, man, so I got a bunch of people, Taylor Goldsmith."""
38:30;38:33;"""All right, so yes, Bob is playing games, man."""
38:33;38:34;"He knew."
38:34;38:36;"He knew Taylor Swift wasn't on that."
38:36;38:38;"Did a number crunch on Bob Dylan, Taylor Swift,"
38:38;38:42;"and there was a song from Taylor's 2020 album, Folklore,"
38:42;38:45;"that used Bob Dylan as a reference."
38:45;38:52;"It's not a cover, but Taylor was definitely--Taylor and Aaron Dessner"
38:52;38:57;"definitely used Bob as an inspiration for her song, Betty."
38:57;38:59;"So Bob wouldn't see anything off."
38:59;39:00;"What do you mean?"
39:00;39:03;"Like they did interviews and they said this is kind of like a Bob Dylan homage?"
39:03;39:04;"Yes."
39:04;39:05;"Do you want to listen to it?"
39:05;39:06;"Let's throw it on."
39:06;39:09;"Also, I can see Bob Dylan being like, ""So what does that get me?"""
39:09;39:10;"Yeah, nothing."
39:10;39:11;"Bob gets nothing off that."
39:11;39:13;"Interpolate one of my songs."
39:13;39:14;"Use a riff."
39:14;39:15;"Here's the quote."
39:15;39:18;"No, Taylor goes up to him at the Grammys when you're just like,"
39:18;39:19;"""Hey, Bob."""
39:19;39:22;"She's like super gracious and nice."
39:22;39:23;"""Bob, you might not know who I am."""
39:23;39:24;"""I know who you are."""
39:24;39:26;"""Oh, wow. Oh, my God. That's amazing."""
39:26;39:28;"I just wanted to say you're a huge inspiration."
39:28;39:31;"Actually, on my Grammy award-winning album, Folklore,"
39:31;39:34;"there's this song, Betty, that's kind of our homage."
39:34;39:37;"He's just like, ""What percentage did I get?"""
39:37;39:39;"She's like, ""Oh, no, no. It's not a cover."
39:39;39:42;"It was just like we were inspired by you."""
39:42;39:44;"He said, ""I don't give a f---."""
39:44;39:47;"He said, ""Hey, you know the song 'Knocking on Heaven's Door'?"""
39:47;39:50;"She's like, ""Yeah."""
39:50;39:54;"He's like, ""Well, yeah. How would you cover that?"""
39:54;39:57;"""I got a bunch of good ones you can--"""
39:57;40:01;"""Those G&R checks are drying up. Come on, Taylor."""
40:01;40:05;"Aaron Dessner explained Taylor wanted to have an early Bob Dylan,"
40:05;40:08;"sort of a freewheeling Bob Dylan feel."
40:08;40:12;"We pushed it a little bit more towards John Wesley Harding"
40:12;40:14;"since it has some drums, et cetera."
40:14;40:15;"Oh, tight."
40:15;40:16;"Yeah."
40:16;40:18;"When I heard the name Betty,"
40:18;40:22;"I first thought of the Bob song ""Joey"" from Desire,"
40:22;40:25;"which I've learned listening to Joker Man is like"
40:25;40:27;"a lot of fans hate the song ""Joey."""
40:27;40:28;"I love that song."
40:28;40:29;"Yeah."
40:39;40:43;"Obviously, the harmonic already gives it a bit of a Bob thing."
40:43;40:45;"Bob's called his lawyer in."
40:45;40:47;"They're just sitting there listening to this song."
40:47;40:48;"Just me."
40:51;40:53;"Do you work with us?"
40:53;40:55;"Is there a grounds for a lawsuit?"
40:55;40:57;"[laughter]"
40:57;41:01;"We had Bob play harmonica for $5 million."
41:05;41:08;"This just sounds like a Taylor Swift song to me."
41:14;41:17;"Where's the John Wesley Harding drums?"
41:17;41:18;"It's fun."
41:18;41:19;"Oh."
41:21;41:23;"It's possible that she--"
41:23;41:26;"maybe she's never had harmonica in a song before."
41:39;41:41;"Drums about to drop."
41:46;41:47;"I'm skipping ahead."
41:47;41:48;"I'm waiting for these drums."
41:48;41:52;"Is it just the acoustic that's giving that percussive sound?"
41:52;41:54;"Maybe they took them out."
41:58;41:59;"Can you hear two acoustics?"
41:59;42:01;"There are drums that are very low."
42:13;42:16;"Born in red-hipped Brooklyn."
42:16;42:19;"In the year of a who-knows-when."
42:19;42:23;"Actually, remember we listened to a song from this album"
42:23;42:26;"or one of the other ones that was about the woman"
42:26;42:31;"who'd owned her mansion in Newport, Rhode Island?"
42:31;42:32;"Oh, right, right."
42:32;42:34;"That's actually maybe more of a Bob Dylan thing"
42:34;42:38;"just to kind of write a historical song."
42:38;42:40;"I get the freewheeling Bob."
42:40;42:43;"It is just interesting that he's this quote--"
42:43;42:45;"maybe we missed it, but this quote is just so specific."
42:45;42:47;"He was like, ""Yeah, Taylor wanted to do a freewheeling Bob thing."""
42:47;42:49;"And I said, ""Let's get a little later in the '60s"
42:49;42:52;"to kind of like a John Wesley Harding thing."""
42:52;42:54;"I feel like the drums on John Wesley Harding"
42:54;42:58;"are real loud and present and really kind of--"
42:58;43:02;"because it's all acoustic, but with this very tight, forceful--"
43:02;43:03;"Great drum sound."
43:03;43:07;"--Kenny Butchry maybe playing drums."
43:07;43:09;"Maybe they had the drums and then they heard it"
43:09;43:11;"and they were like, ""This is too Dylan."
43:11;43:13;"He could get litigious over it."
43:13;43:14;"Let's dial back the influence."""
43:14;43:16;"Yeah, maybe let's dial it back."
43:16;43:18;"Now I'm also just picturing her being like,"
43:18;43:20;"""Yeah, this is kind of like a folky song."
43:20;43:22;"I thought maybe I'd throw in some harmonica"
43:22;43:25;"and do kind of like early Bob type thing."""
43:25;43:27;"And he's like, ""That's played out."
43:27;43:29;"Want to do kind of like a Joker Man thing?"
43:29;43:31;"Kind of like an '80s reggae version?"""
43:31;43:34;"It's like, ""All right. All right, I'll try it."""
43:34;43:35;"Would love it."
43:35;43:39;"Just throws out some really, really deep Bob reference."
43:39;43:41;"Okay, well, speaking of deep Bob,"
43:41;43:43;"let's see where this takes us, man."
43:43;43:44;"Yeah, let's crack this."
43:44;43:46;"Greatest Hits, Volume 3."
43:46;43:50;"So I think--I imagine that the average TC fan"
43:50;43:53;"is totally aware of Bob Dylan."
43:53;43:57;"We don't need to do some top five Bob homework."
43:57;43:59;"Because everybody knows Bob Dylan."
43:59;44:02;"Being in this current listening to a lot of Bob"
44:02;44:04;"and listening to Joker Man and stuff,"
44:04;44:06;"I've been talking about Bob a lot."
44:06;44:09;"And at some point, Rashida claimed that--"
44:09;44:12;"She's like, ""I don't really--I never got deep on Dylan."
44:12;44:13;"I really don't know."""
44:13;44:15;"But then we talked about it, and I was like--"
44:15;44:17;"And I think this is probably true for a lot of people."
44:17;44:20;"It might not be true for a Leonard Cohen or--"
44:20;44:22;"She was like, ""Well, of course, I know 'Blown in the Wind.'"""
44:22;44:24;"And I think that--honestly, I think that might be it."
44:24;44:25;"Then we just talked about it."
44:25;44:26;"I was like, ""You know 'Hurricane?'"""
44:26;44:27;"She was like, ""Oh, yeah."""
44:27;44:29;"I was like, ""You know 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door?'"""
44:29;44:30;"She's like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."""
44:30;44:31;"And next thing you know, it's like,"
44:31;44:33;"everybody knows at least 10 Bob songs."
44:33;44:34;"Yeah."
44:34;44:37;"And that's before you even get into the weird stuff,"
44:37;44:39;"which, of course, there's quite a bit of"
44:39;44:41;"over the course of 39 studio albums."
44:41;44:44;"And I guess what I've been interested in Dylan lately,"
44:44;44:47;"and of course I've always, or at least for the last few years,"
44:47;44:49;"had a deep love of his song ""Joker Man,"""
44:49;44:50;"which is from the '80s."
44:50;44:53;"'80s Dylan, you're well out of what"
44:53;44:56;"many people consider the classic period."
44:56;44:58;"You know, obviously the '60s are huge,"
44:58;45:00;"pretty unprecedented run."
45:00;45:03;"And then in the '70s, by some people's metrics,"
45:03;45:04;"a little bit up and down,"
45:04;45:07;"but still producing multiple classic, classic albums."
45:07;45:09;"So by the time you get to like the '80s,"
45:09;45:13;"he was maybe not super culturally relevant."
45:13;45:14;"Of course he's Bob Dylan,"
45:14;45:16;"so I'm sure there was somebody buying a copy"
45:16;45:19;"of the Freewheel and Bob Dylan or Desire every day."
45:19;45:21;"But, you know, when you actually picture him"
45:21;45:23;"in the early '80s, when you really picture"
45:23;45:25;"punk and new wave and hip hop happening,"
45:25;45:29;"of course people respected him, but he was, you know,"
45:29;45:32;"he was a man in his early '40s,"
45:32;45:35;"an icon of the '60s in, you know,"
45:35;45:38;"a time when the popular music really was not"
45:38;45:41;"sounding like '60s music in terms of the production."
45:41;45:44;"And when, you know, we've talked many times on this show"
45:44;45:49;"about the '80s kicking off with John Lennon's murder"
45:49;45:50;"and the election of Reagan."
45:50;45:53;"So you could just, like so many reasons why"
45:53;45:55;"a '60s icon in their '40s might feel like"
45:55;45:57;"a little bit at loose ends."
45:57;46:00;"- Yeah, I think a lot of the stars from the '60s"
46:00;46:02;"were in a similar place to Dylan."
46:02;46:05;"A little bit just like fish out of water."
46:05;46:07;"Think about Neil Young's early '80s work."
46:07;46:09;"- Oh, that's when he got really weird."
46:09;46:13;"- A guy from the '60s and '70s entering into the '80s"
46:13;46:17;"with the new production sounds of the era"
46:17;46:19;"and just making records in that context."
46:19;46:21;"It's all, I love that tension."
46:21;46:22;"- And I was thinking about this too,"
46:22;46:24;"and I'm sure you've put the hunt to this too, Jake,"
46:24;46:28;"but like how shockingly little music there is"
46:28;46:30;"that still sounds like the '60s or '70s."
46:30;46:31;"I mean, and of course you could,"
46:31;46:35;"that's also the rise of some weird DIY cassette indie stuff."
46:35;46:38;"So you can find stuff that's like vibey with tape hiss,"
46:38;46:40;"but when you listen to the music,"
46:40;46:44;"you could totally understand if many of the older musicians"
46:44;46:47;"decided to try to keep up with the new sounds,"
46:47;46:50;"'80s drum sounds, new digital recording,"
46:50;46:52;"but you would think maybe there'd be some percentage"
46:52;46:53;"of people who'd be like,"
46:53;46:56;"""Oh man, I'm sticking with my old board and tape machine."
46:56;46:57;"""It still works."""
46:57;46:59;"And we know this equipment exists"
46:59;47:02;"because there's people spending millions of dollars on it now."
47:02;47:04;"You always hear this where people are like,"
47:04;47:07;"""Oh yeah,"" and then this rich dude bought the board"
47:07;47:10;"that was at Abbey Road"
47:10;47:12;"that they recorded ""Dark Side of the Moon"" on."
47:12;47:14;"Oh man, he paid $3 million for it."
47:14;47:17;"There's even famous boards"
47:17;47:21;"where people will buy like a single channel"
47:21;47:23;"'cause then you can like pop out the channels"
47:23;47:25;"and you don't necessarily need the whole board"
47:25;47:27;"in the modern world."
47:27;47:29;"And they'll pay top dollar,"
47:29;47:31;"especially if the provenance is interesting."
47:31;47:33;"And then old tape machines,"
47:33;47:35;"sometimes getting tape can be an issue,"
47:35;47:36;"but people covered this stuff."
47:36;47:38;"So it's not like it was all destroyed,"
47:38;47:40;"but sometimes it does feel like in the '80s"
47:40;47:42;"it was all put in a closet."
47:42;47:43;"And I wonder if like,"
47:43;47:46;"even if you're Bob Dylan or something or Neil Young,"
47:46;47:49;"and this was maybe not their artistic intention,"
47:49;47:51;"but you could think maybe one of these '60s guys"
47:51;47:52;"would be like,"
47:52;47:54;"""Let's just like keep using the old tape machine."
47:54;47:56;"""It's got a certain, it's kind of my sound."
47:56;47:57;"""I wanna stick with it."""
47:57;47:59;"And yet literally nobody did."
47:59;48:00;"So then you start to imagine"
48:00;48:02;"that either they built a new home studio"
48:02;48:04;"and it was like top of the line gear,"
48:04;48:06;"or they rolled into all the normal studios"
48:06;48:08;"in the big cities that they would go to"
48:08;48:11;"and just things had moved on."
48:11;48:12;"And they'd listen back"
48:12;48:14;"and they'd just be like, ""Ah, close enough."""
48:14;48:15;"- That paints a portrait of these artists"
48:15;48:16;"being very passive,"
48:16;48:18;"which they clearly weren't."
48:18;48:20;"So it's like, it is fascinating"
48:20;48:23;"that the picture, these guys recording in like 1982"
48:23;48:25;"and like hearing that like drum tone"
48:25;48:26;"with all the reverb on it"
48:26;48:29;"and being like, ""Does that sound good to you guys?"""
48:29;48:31;"And then you're being like, ""Yep, sounds good."""
48:31;48:32;"And I guess maybe if also,"
48:33;48:35;"if we're talking about these major icons,"
48:35;48:37;"they were still interested in maybe like"
48:37;48:38;"trying to have hits"
48:38;48:40;"and like not wanting to admit"
48:40;48:43;"that like maybe their biggest days were behind them,"
48:43;48:44;"which is human nature."
48:44;48:45;"And they were just like,"
48:45;48:46;"""Yeah, let's keep up with the times."
48:46;48:48;"""Like I was a big deal in 1970."
48:48;48:50;"""Why can't I be a big deal in 1982?"""
48:50;48:52;"- Yeah, I want this to sound fresh."
48:52;48:53;"Yeah, you're right."
48:53;48:55;"Because Neil Young or Bob Dylan or George Harrison,"
48:55;48:58;"whoever, if they had gone to a big studio"
48:58;49:01;"and said like, ""Get this crap out of here."
49:01;49:02;"""Bring back the old tape machine."
49:02;49:04;"""I don't want anything digital in."""
49:04;49:06;"You know, you'd probably have a bunch of like studio interns"
49:06;49:08;"being like, ""Oh, it's gonna be a (beep) long night."""
49:08;49:09;"But whatever, they would do it."
49:09;49:10;"- Yeah."
49:10;49:12;"- I think a big part of it too is like,"
49:12;49:13;"and I'm a little bit out of my depth here,"
49:13;49:15;"obviously I have some familiarity with this stuff,"
49:15;49:17;"but I'm not like a hardcore tech dude."
49:17;49:18;"And in fact, I know a few people"
49:18;49:20;"who really study the history of recording."
49:20;49:22;"It might be cool to have on the show one day."
49:22;49:25;"I also just feel like the tape machines changed."
49:25;49:27;"Maybe some of the boards are probably the same."
49:27;49:30;"It's just like this really subtle way that even"
49:30;49:34;"music from the '80s, when they're not going"
49:34;49:36;"for the big gated reverb on the drums"
49:36;49:37;"or like using synths,"
49:37;49:40;"these like very obvious things that connote '80s,"
49:40;49:42;"even when they are using like acoustic instruments"
49:42;49:44;"and probably the same players and the same,"
49:44;49:46;"you know, the same drum kit,"
49:46;49:47;"maybe even the same mics,"
49:47;49:50;"I do think just like the tape machines changed."
49:50;49:51;"- Yeah, no, I know what you mean."
49:51;49:56;"- And maybe very few people at that time were like--"
49:56;49:57;"- Okay, here's a test."
49:57;49:58;"- Yeah."
49:58;50:00;"- Do you know the Empire Burlesque album?"
50:00;50:01;"- Vaguely."
50:01;50:03;"- The last song on it is called ""Dark Eyes."""
50:03;50:04;"- Yeah."
50:04;50:06;"- And that is, it's a Bob Dylan record we're talking about."
50:06;50:09;"The last song is just him in acoustic"
50:09;50:11;"and maybe a harmonica."
50:11;50:13;"And it sounds like an old Bob Dylan song."
50:13;50:14;"- So this is from '85."
50:14;50:16;"- I'm curious to hear what this sounds like."
50:16;50:18;"- And interestingly, I don't think this,"
50:18;50:20;"he put a single song from Empire Burlesque"
50:20;50:22;"on Bob Dylan's ""Greatest Hits Vol. 3."""
50:22;50:24;"So maybe he wasn't feeling it too much."

52:57;52:59;"- I'm pretty sure Bruce is 50."
52:59;53:01;"- You think he was born in 1950?"
53:01;53:02;"- I do."
53:02;53:04;"- I'm sorry, Jake, I hate to see you..."
53:04;53:05;"- Can we get another crunch on it?"
53:05;53:07;"- I hate to see you wipe out like this,"
53:07;53:09;"but I guarantee Bruce is not born in 1950."
53:09;53:11;"- How much you wanna bet?"
53:11;53:13;"- Well, 'cause my dad was born in 1950,"
53:13;53:16;"so there's no way I would've looked"
53:16;53:19;"at Bruce's Wikipedia page and not clocked"
53:19;53:21;"that they were both born in 1950."
53:21;53:22;"- 49."

53:23;53:24;"- Knew it."
53:24;53:25;"- Damn it."
53:25;53:26;"- Knew it."

53:27;53:28;"- September 23rd, though, so you're close."
53:28;53:29;"Just a couple months off."
53:29;53:30;"- Why did I think 50?"
53:30;53:31;"- No, you're right."
53:31;53:34;"September 23rd, '49 is basically 1950."
53:34;53:38;"But as Jake well knows, so near yet so far,"
53:38;53:41;"to be born in '49, it's a different beast."
53:41;53:42;"'Cause also..."
53:42;53:43;"- I'm embarrassed."
53:43;53:45;"- I feel like talking to my parents"
53:45;53:47;"or my mom or something, when Tom Petty died,"
53:47;53:49;"my mom pointed out, and you know what?"
53:49;53:51;"He was born on the same day as your dad."
53:51;53:54;"- So he was only a year younger than Bruce?"
53:54;53:55;"- Tom Petty?"
53:55;53:56;"- Yeah."
53:56;53:57;"- Wow."
53:57;53:58;"- Yeah, exactly, one year."
53:58;54:00;"- So he was pretty old by the time he got truckin'."
54:00;54:01;"'Cause it's like his..."
54:01;54:02;"- Yeah, he was late 20s."
54:02;54:04;"- In the torpedoes, it was like '78 or something?"
54:04;54:06;"- Yeah, so he was like 28, yeah."
54:06;54:09;"- Wow, that's old by rock and roll standards"
54:09;54:10;"of the '70s."
54:10;54:12;"- Yes, as a silverback."
54:12;54:13;"He came in as a silverback."
54:13;54:14;"- Yeah, as a silverback."
54:14;54:17;"But yeah, so I always remember that Tom Petty"
54:17;54:21;"was the exact same age as my dad to the day."
54:21;54:24;"I knew by process of elimination that there was no way"
54:24;54:26;"that Bruce was born in '50."
54:26;54:28;"And also, I feel like when you're a real"
54:28;54:32;"Wikipedia music nerd head, you of course wanna know"
54:32;54:35;"what year a record came out, and you also wanna know"
54:35;54:36;"how old the artist was."
54:36;54:37;"- Of course."
54:37;54:38;"- That's very, I know Jacob--"
54:38;54:39;"- That is a classic number crunch."
54:39;54:40;"- You gotta know."
54:40;54:44;"So of course, I always know in my head"
54:44;54:47;"that Bob was born in '41."
54:47;54:50;"- So he's 50 in 1991."
54:50;54:53;"- Yeah, and it's also amazing to think he was so young"
54:53;54:55;"when the early records came out."
54:55;54:56;"He was--"
54:56;54:57;"- 21?"
54:57;54:59;"- He might have been 21 when he recorded ""Free Will"""
54:59;55:01;"and ""Bob Dylan,"" maybe 22 tops."
55:01;55:02;"- Yeah."
55:02;55:05;"- It's also wild too to think about when he was writing"
55:05;55:08;"and recording ""Planet Waves"" and ""Blood on the Tracks,"""
55:08;55:11;"he was like 33, 34."
55:11;55:13;"That comes to mind a lot because,"
55:13;55:16;"especially in Bob's career, those are his"
55:16;55:19;"mature divorce albums."
55:19;55:21;"When you think about Bob when you're a kid"
55:21;55:23;"and you might hear something about ""Blood on the Tracks,"""
55:23;55:26;"you think about that, and maybe you're starting"
55:26;55:28;"to poke around on early Bob Dylan stuff,"
55:28;55:30;"you know, ""Blood on the Tracks,"" you kinda think,"
55:30;55:34;"well, yeah, I'll be ready for that in about 50 years."

55:36;55:38;"when you're young, it almost seems like a record"
55:38;55:40;"that was made by a 50-year-old."
55:40;55:41;"- It's very adult."
55:41;55:43;"- It's not even just grown up, it's like grown up"
55:43;55:46;"and been through this crazy life cycle event."
55:46;55:48;"Anyway, that comes to mind a lot because,"
55:48;55:50;"Jake, you'd been talking about not that long ago,"
55:50;55:53;"watching the ""Machine Gun Kelly"" documentary."
55:53;55:54;"That made me wanna watch it."
55:54;55:55;"- That's right."
55:55;55:56;"- And then I was watching it and--"
55:56;55:57;"- NGK."
55:57;55:58;"- And I couldn't help it, maybe just because"
55:58;55:59;"I'd been listening to a lot of Bob, and I was like,"
55:59;56:02;"all right, so ""Machine Gun Kelly"" is like 32,"
56:02;56:05;"so if he was Bob Dylan, he'd be gearing up"
56:05;56:07;"to make ""Planet Waves"" right now."

57:24;57:26;"when it came out, the way he made it,"
57:26;57:28;"the cover, is why--"
57:28;57:29;"- Mm-hmm."
57:29;57:31;"- He would have so many great songs without it,"
57:31;57:33;"and yet, if you took this out of his discography,"
57:33;57:34;"I feel like it all crumbles."
57:34;57:37;"- If it goes from ""The River"" to ""Born in the USA,"""
57:37;57:39;"it's not nearly as interesting."
57:39;57:40;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:40;57:42;"- Having the weird lo-fi record right in the middle."
57:42;57:46;"- ♪ If it was any other man ♪"
57:46;57:48;"- You know, also, you know, what's interesting to me"
57:48;57:50;"is that you think about, like,"
57:50;57:52;"Bruce deciding to let these demos go."
57:52;57:54;"Of course, it doesn't actually sound like"
57:54;57:56;"it's from the early '60s,"
57:56;57:58;"and yet, you could imagine Bruce"
57:58;58:00;"having just been at a high-end studio"
58:00;58:03;"with a friend of the show, Jimmy Iovine."
58:03;58:05;"[laughs]"
58:05;58:08;"Friend of the Apple Music Organization, Jimmy Iovine."
58:08;58:10;"You know, he'd just been recording ""The River."""
58:10;58:12;"You could imagine Bruce being, like,"
58:12;58:15;"this kind of, like, infamous stickler,"
58:15;58:17;"obsessive dude, and if you've ever seen"
58:17;58:19;"the documentary about ""The River,"" you know"
58:19;58:20;"they're, like, going so hard on it."
58:20;58:21;"- Yeah."
58:21;58:22;"- You could picture him, like..."
58:22;58:23;"[guitar playing]"
58:23;58:25;"See, this sounds like 1980."
58:25;58:26;"- This sounds more like ""Dark Eyes."""
58:26;58:27;"- Yeah, yeah."
58:27;58:28;"- Like a guitar tone."
58:28;58:30;"- This is '80s digital tape vibe."
58:30;58:32;"So you could imagine Bruce having done this"
58:32;58:34;"and being, like, happy with this album,"
58:34;58:35;"but also being, like,"
58:35;58:37;"""I want something that has, like, the energy"
58:37;58:40;"of, like, the early records I was into."
58:40;58:42;"Bob Dylan, early rock 'n' roll, whatever."""
58:42;58:44;"And maybe he just found at that point"
58:44;58:46;"it'd be insane to, like, go in with, like,"
58:46;58:48;"to ask Jimmy Iovine at the high-end,"
58:48;58:50;"you know, hit factory or wherever they made this."
58:50;58:52;"He just realized the closest thing"
58:52;58:54;"he could get at that moment"
58:54;58:56;"was using the 4-track tape recorder."
58:56;58:58;"- Yeah, I read the memoir."
58:58;58:59;"I'm trying to remember if that was--"
58:59;59:01;"if he had specifically addressed that,"
59:01;59:03;"'cause it is almost like, yeah, like,"
59:03;59:04;"I could picture him thinking about, like,"
59:04;59:06;"Buddy Holly or Roy Orbison."
59:06;59:09;"Not that, like, Nebraska sounds like those artists."
59:09;59:10;"- Yeah."
59:10;59:12;"- But a comparable recording situation."
59:12;59:13;"- And I guess that's what's cool,"
59:13;59:15;"and also why, like, you know,"
59:15;59:18;"you even think about ""chill wave."""
59:18;59:20;"I guess that's kind of an outdated term,"
59:20;59:21;"but, you know, ""chill wave,"""
59:21;59:24;"which has, in a way, morphed into, you know,"
59:24;59:29;"this lo-fi hip-hop beats to study to type music."
59:29;59:33;"Arguably, ""chill wave"" has cast a really, like, long shadow,"
59:33;59:35;"and a lot of it was based on samples."
59:35;59:37;"And you kind of realize ""chill wave,"" in a way, I think,"
59:37;59:41;"was also artists trying to capture"
59:41;59:44;"a vibey analog feel from music they grew up with."
59:44;59:46;"But, of course, now they're doing it"
59:46;59:47;"in Ableton and Pro Tools"
59:47;59:50;"and using samples and stretching stuff out."
59:50;59:52;"So, you know, it's like trying to get back to that sound,"
59:52;59:54;"and yet, because you're in the modern world,"
59:54;59:56;"it turns into something different."
59:56;59:57;"But it's also, like, a good reminder"
59:57;59:59;"how sometimes, you know, looking backwards"
59:59;01:00:04;"and ""nostalgia"" actually produces something,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"you know, you almost, like, can't worry about it too much."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Like, you know, if you love the tasteful palette"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"of the 1970s, like, yeah, go ahead."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Try to recreate it right now."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"You'll get something different."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"- You'll get ""Mountain Bruce."""
01:00:14;01:00:16;"- You'll get ""Mountain Bruce."" Yeah."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"- Which you would not confuse for '70s music."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"- The best of the old and the new."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- What's going on with that ""Mountain Bruce"" vinyl?"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"Do you want to plug that in for a second?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"- That's coming out in October."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"I think we're going to do pre-orders in August sometime."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"- It's looking good."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Yeah, the art's amazing."
01:00:30;01:00:34;"- We actually got the physical release."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- You got the physical release?"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Mm-hmm."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Got the art for the physical release,"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"and it looks great."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- Sick."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"- First ever physical release."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Wait, 'cause how long has ""Mountain Bruce"""
01:00:43;01:00:45;"been going now, like, five years?"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- Three."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"2019."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"- Was when the first one dropped."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"- Mm-hmm."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"- Three years in, first physical release."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"- Yep."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Double."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"- So did you throw it on,"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"on the sound system at home?"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- Listen to the record?"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"- Got the test pressings."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Sound pretty good."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Pretty good."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- And this is the full catalog on vinyl."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"This is every song."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- Yep."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"All 17 ""Mountain Bruce"" songs coming out."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"Double album, self-titled ""Mountain Bruce."""
01:01:10;01:01:11;"- You doing merch?"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"- We'll do some merch."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"- So because this 2LP set"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"is the material from the first four ""Mountain Bruce"" EPs,"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"in your mind and in your marketing materials,"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"do you refer to this as a compilation,"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"or you just say,"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"""It's finally here, 'Mountain Bruce' debut album?"""
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- No, it's a comp."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"- It's a comp, okay."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- It's a comp."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- It's kind of how ""The Weeknd"" started, too."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Really?"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- Right?"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"- ""House of Balloons."""
01:01:36;01:01:37;"- Yeah, Seinfeld, you want to weigh in"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"on some Canadian musical history?"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"- I mean, you said it all."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"It's just how ""The Weeknd"" did it."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- Yeah, the EP."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- He did the mixtapes,"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"then he put them all together in an album."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"I mean, you're really following ""The Weeknd"" model."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"- I just mean ""The Weeknd"" did four EPs"
01:01:48;01:01:53;"of the tasteful '70s-inspired country folk rock."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"- '70s."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"- And then compiled them on a two LP set."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"No, yeah, he put out a bunch of EPs,"
01:01:58;01:02:03;"and then his first long player was all the EPs together,"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"and then he made his first debut album."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- So will you be releasing"
01:02:07;01:02:11;"the double on streaming services as one album?"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"- No."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- I think that's a mistake."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Yeah, keep it in the physical world."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- I don't know."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- It seems like you're--"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- You think that's a mistake?"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- That you're leaving a lot of money on the table."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"- I've looked over those Mountain Bruce sales numbers,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"and let me tell you, we're not."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- I mean, I think Mountain Bruce"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"is doing pretty good numbers for pure self-released."
01:02:28;01:02:33;"- The song ""Mountain Bruce"" surprisingly does strong numbers."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- I don't think there's anything surprising about it."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"- The song ""Mountain Bruce"" has its own life."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"- And also, just to contextualize it,"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"if Mountain Bruce is doing numbers"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"on other streaming services,"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"that really says a lot when you consider"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"that so many Mountain Bruce fans,"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"like all good-hearted people,"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"listen to Apple Music."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"'Cause there are probably people who heard,"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"we did some Sweet Chili Heat premieres,"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"so people, I imagine you've got a ton of Apple Music listeners."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"You know what else would be classic, though?"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"And I don't know what the plan is for other territories."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"That's some stuff you'd totally be reading,"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"like going down some rabbit hole"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"reading about somebody's career,"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"and it'd be like,"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"they released the first four EPs in America,"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"which was presented as a collection for the US market,"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"but in the Philippines,"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"that's generally seen as Mountain Bruce's first debut album."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"(laughing)"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"Because nobody, like nobody'd heard ""Bruise"""
01:03:25;01:03:29;"in the Philippines until the two-album set dropped."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"There was zero awareness that those were four EPs."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"So generally when Filipino music historians"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"are looking at the ""Bruise"" discography,"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"they count that as a studio album."
01:03:40;01:03:44;"There was an influential DJ in the Philippines"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"that got the vinyl,"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"started spinning,"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"he started with side three, ""Raisin' in Place."""
01:03:51;01:03:52;"That's right."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"""Raisin' in Place"" really struck a nerve."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Actually, yeah, disc one was damaged,"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"so he actually never was able to play"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"any of the original Mountain Bruce stuff."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"He only did ""Raisin' in Place"" and ""Down to the Studs."""
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Wait, so is this two-album set,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"is it just called Mountain Bruce?"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"It's just called Mountain Bruce."
01:04:08;01:04:11;"All right, so you can see the confusion."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"A lot of confusion."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"On Wikipedia, ""Mountain Bruce disambiguation page."""
01:04:16;01:04:17;"(laughing)"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Mountain Bruce can refer to"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"the musical project Mountain Bruce,"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"the song Mountain Bruce,"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"the 2019 EP Mountain Bruce,"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"the 2022 collection Mountain Bruce,"
01:04:28;01:04:32;"or the social phenomenon of Mountain Bruce."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Or literal Mountain Bruce,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"'cause I should also mention that there is a brewery"
01:04:36;01:04:39;"in Ohio called Modern Methods Brewery"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"that is putting out Mountain Bruce."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Oh, wow."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"It is a--"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"In conjunction with the release?"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"Around the same time."
01:04:45;01:04:47;"It just worked out timing-wise."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Did you design the can?"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"The can is the record cover--"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Sick."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"--of the eagle with the six-pack ring--"
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Wow."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"--and the mountains."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"Did you have to approve the samples?"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Haven't tasted it yet."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"It's--"
01:05:01;01:05:02;"What if you hate it?"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Oh, I'll love it."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"It's the riffing on Wurst Marg,"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"and I'm just trying to--"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Hold on, let me just--"
01:05:09;01:05:12;"Wait, wait, it's a margarita-flavored beer?"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"No, no, no, no."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"It's--"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Well, while Jake searches,"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"I'll just throw out that the 1975, the band--"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Yeah."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"--the first song on their debut album,"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"the 1975, is called The 1975."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"No, I think every album they do starts with--"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"It has a song called The 1975."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Oh, really?"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Yeah."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Oh."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"I thought you were going to say it's called Mountain Bruce."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I mean, that would be way cooler."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"Okay."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"Mountain Bruce, key lime pilsner, 4.5%."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Whoa."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"A pilsner fermented with the key lime and blue agave"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"with a crack of sea salt for the crispiest of crispy,"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"fruited lagers."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"I gotta tell you,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"I don't know if you're going to like that."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"We brewed this to be the best beer"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"for when you can't get your hands on the worst margarita"

01:05:54;01:05:55;"Well, look, either way,"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"whether Jake loves it or hates it,"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"it still tracks."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"No, it's great."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"It tracks."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"I'm just saying that how confidently and quickly he said,"

01:08:24;01:08:27;"But how, you know, just one day,"

01:08:55;01:08:57;"And I think it's almost always"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"because the distribution channels are"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"controlled by a few companies, like,"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"for all--you know, Procter & Gamble or something."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"It's basically just, yeah, they bought it."

01:09:20;01:09:23;"All right, so Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume 3."

01:09:38;01:09:40;"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume 3,"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"because it covers so much of his, like, weird years,"

01:09:45;01:09:47;"I just find it to be such a fascinating collection."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"And I think it's also just a good way in"

01:09:52;01:09:54;"They know all the classic albums,"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"and just like, ""Yeah, I don't know any of that '80s stuff."""

01:10:00;01:10:01;"There's a bunch of '70s stuff, too."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"And so I guess the first thing you need to understand"

01:10:05;01:10:07;"to the Greatest Hits format"
01:10:07;01:10:11;"is that, you know, as with his Taylor Swift comment,"

01:10:36;01:10:39;"Opens with ""Rainy Day Woman"" number 12 and 35,"

01:16:29;01:16:32;"I'm not talking about the people who are like the hardcore Dylanologists."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"I'm just saying, like, grab some old dude off the street,"
01:16:34;01:16:35;"you're like, ""You like Bob Dylan?"""
01:16:35;01:16:37;"""Oh, absolutely, man. '60s, yeah."""
01:16:37;01:16:40;"Just be like, ""Watching the River Flow,"" right?"
01:16:40;01:16:43;"A lot of them are just going to be like, ""Oh, not familiar with that one."""
01:16:43;01:16:47;"And maybe it kind of worked that now some people are more familiar"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"with these songs, but by the time you get to his greatest hits volume two,"
01:16:49;01:16:53;"his greatest hits volume three, it's really wild because--"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Yeah, maybe he just wanted to take control of the narrative,"
01:16:55;01:16:56;"which makes a lot of sense."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"He famously is a guy who felt kind of misunderstood by the press,"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"felt like he was kind of forced into a box."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"You could imagine him wanting to be--"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"tell his own story with his greatest hits,"
01:17:08;01:17:13;"even if it starts to undermine the concept of a hit."
01:17:13;01:17:16;"So anyway, that's all the backstory to lead us up to"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Bob Dylan's greatest hits volume three,"
01:17:18;01:17:22;"which is what I recommend for the casual Bob fan"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"who's ready to take it one step deeper."
01:17:24;01:17:28;"Maybe you're not ready to listen to Empire Burlesque front to back,"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"but this--"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Few are."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Few are."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"This is your way in."
01:17:33;01:17:36;"So Bob Dylan's greatest hits volume three."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"When did this come out?"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"This came out in the '90s."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"'94."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"So '94, Bob Dylan's 53 years old,"
01:17:42;01:17:46;"hadn't had his kind of commercial critical renaissance yet"
01:17:46;01:17:50;"that he had with Time Out of Mind and his kind of old dude albums"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"where people were like, ""Oh yeah, Bob."""
01:17:51;01:17:53;"So this is kind of a random period for him."
01:17:53;01:17:57;"So you can imagine in '94, Bob's really thinking a lot about"
01:17:57;01:18:03;"how does he want to tell the story of the past 20 years of his career."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Because there's a lot of ways he could do it."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"So he opens up with, I think--"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Pretty classic move."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"A pretty classic big hit for him."
01:18:09;01:18:13;"He's not being quite as weird as opening up with Watching the River Flow."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"He opens up with Tangled Up in Blue,"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"which is from an album that's generally considered"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"one of his all-time greats."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"Blood on the Tracks."
01:18:20;01:18:35;"This has been one of my favorite Bob songs of maybe the last year or so."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"Oh, it's interesting because on the Jokerman pod,"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"you talk about how you prefer Planet Waves."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"I do, as a record."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"Yeah."
01:18:43;01:18:46;"But this is one of my favorite Bob songs, I think."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"That's a great song."
01:18:47;01:19:00;"I love that East Coast shout-out."
01:19:06;01:19:10;"I wonder if he plays that on the Eastern Seaboard and is like, ""Woo!"""
01:19:10;01:19:12;"""East Coast!"""
01:19:12;01:19:14;"""Planet in Delaware."" ""Woo!"""
01:19:14;01:19:15;"That's right."
01:19:15;01:19:24;"I mean, yeah, this is just like all these vignettes."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"People pontificate on this song for decades."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"Right."
01:19:28;01:19:33;"To me, it's just like the most vivid storytelling in a song."
01:19:33;01:19:37;"All these different stories don't even seem like the same person,"
01:19:37;01:19:41;"interrelated, and then just wrapping it up with this turn of phrase,"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"""Tangled up in blue,"" which you can almost take for granted"
01:19:45;01:19:49;"because the song is so familiar, but when you really think about it"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"and think about how at this moment in the '70s,"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"he would have known a billion songs where people talk about"
01:19:54;01:19:59;"feeling blue or being blue, and he just does a slight tweak to it,"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"""Tangled up in blue,"" and just immediately feels so different."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Yeah."
01:20:03;01:20:06;"Is ""tangled up in blue"" meaning you're just feeling bummed?"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"It doesn't sound quite like that."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"It sounds weirder."
01:20:09;01:20:13;"It sounds like you're interacting with a weird tangled up in blue,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"just like a different feeling."
01:20:15;01:20:20;"Yeah, it's a little messier than just being like, ""I'm down."""
01:20:20;01:20:23;"Yeah, because getting tangled up almost feels like you're fighting with something."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"It's a little more chaotic."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Yeah."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Tangled up."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"♪ Tangled up in blue ♪"
01:20:39;01:20:43;"♪ She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer ♪"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Great claret."
01:20:44;01:20:48;"♪ I just kept looking at the side of her face and the spotlight so clear ♪"
01:20:48;01:20:53;"♪ Later on when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same ♪"

01:21:15;01:21:18;"Quick question about the greatest hits format."
01:21:18;01:21:21;"Typically, does the artist pick their songs?"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"I've always sort of thought of it as a record label sort of cash grab in a way."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"That's a good point."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Totally."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"I think sometimes the record label could--"
01:21:29;01:21:34;"Bob's been on the same label, also the current home of Vampire Weekend, Columbia Records,"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"for his entire career."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Very unusual."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Wow."
01:21:39;01:21:43;"He was signed to Columbia Records in the early '60s,"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"and he's still on Columbia Records now."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Amazing."
01:21:46;01:21:51;"He survived the purchase of Columbia Records by the Japanese conglomerate Sony,"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"and he's been there the whole time."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"You would imagine he has--"
01:21:55;01:21:58;"Sometimes you hear these stories where, famously, the Red Hot Chili Peppers,"
01:21:58;01:22:01;"I think they were on Warner Brothers, and then they bounced,"
01:22:01;01:22:05;"and then they made Blood Sugar Sex Magic for somebody else,"
01:22:05;01:22:09;"and then Warner, seeing how big they got, compiled all their '80s stuff"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"and just made a weird greatest hits."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"I kind of remember coming across--"
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Oh, yeah, I remember that."
01:22:13;01:22:16;"--their great hits by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and just being like,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"""Where's all the good sh--?"""
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Kind of."
01:22:19;01:22:23;"Anyway, so Bob opens with Tangled Up In Blue, classic song,"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"and I think a fairly successful single in the '70s."
01:22:26;01:22:29;"It also just reminds me of a thought that I've had sometimes with Bob."
01:22:29;01:22:34;"When you think about how Bob was so influential to the other artists around him,"
01:22:34;01:22:39;"the people who were slightly later, or just after him, or a tiny bit younger,"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"I just find it's interesting for me to think about, like all kind of music tweebs,"
01:22:43;01:22:47;"you can obsess so much about the Beatles and the Stones and what they were doing,"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"and wow, and then the Beatles decided they started smoking weed,"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"or then they got into Indian music, and they made these choices."
01:22:53;01:22:56;"I've also found it very interesting to sometimes think about"
01:22:56;01:23:00;"what Bob Dylan was doing a few months before they made that record."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"It suddenly just contextualizes stuff, and I guess this is pretty obvious,"
01:23:03;01:23:06;"but sometimes when I actually listen to the records, I feel it more."
01:23:06;01:23:10;"When you picture the Beatles making Rubber Soul, a kind of artistic breakthrough,"
01:23:10;01:23:15;"and doing Norwegian Wood, which I think John Sett was kind of doing a Bob Dylan thing,"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"and you picture them trying to experiment a little bit more,"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"and then you listen to the records that Bob Dylan made in 1965,"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"and you think about them listening to a Rolling Stone or Desolation Row,"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"I might have the math a little bit off, but more or less the same."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"That's '65."
01:23:29;01:23:33;"Yeah, I'm just saying, I don't know which albums came out before Rubber Soul."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"And just suddenly you picture them hearing those songs,"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"you can suddenly imagine how they probably felt kind of like dorks."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"And then you even just picture this point, '75,"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"all those guys just listening to Bob drop Tangled Up in Blue."
01:23:46;01:23:51;"And just, you know, he was like, always probably seemed a few steps ahead."
01:23:51;01:23:55;"Like even when people were doing great work, and then Bob just drops something like that,"
01:23:55;01:23:58;"that probably always provided a bit of an inspiration"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"or even a competitive spirit or something,"
01:24:00;01:24:05;"just because he always just seemed like artistically like 10 or 20 years older."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"They're listening to Highway 61 and they're just like, ""Damn, that's out of tune."""
01:24:09;01:24:12;"They left it like that? That is the most..."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Just be like, ""This is baller."""
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Yeah, exactly. Just like, ""Wow."""
01:24:16;01:24:21;"They didn't have the term punk really, but like, ""Damn, Bob went hard with leaving that."""
01:24:21;01:24:24;"Those guitars are so out of tune on that record."
01:24:24;01:24:29;"Queen Jane approximately, like you put that on, you're just like, ""This is wild."""
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Yeah, it's raw."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"I need to get into the weeds for a second."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"Seinfeld, tell me what date did the Beatles album Help come out?"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"I love this."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"We need to really get into some..."
01:24:40;01:24:43;"Granular mid-60s rock history. Let's go."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"1965."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"What's the date though?"
01:24:46;01:24:51;"Oh, well, in the US, it was July 19th."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"How about in the Philippines?"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"Oh, Philippines, 1987?"
01:24:56;01:24:59;"No."
01:24:59;01:25:03;"UK, July 23rd, 1965."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"Okay, so I want to point out, because back then, records, it seemed like they'd turn them in."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"There were none of these supply chain issues."
01:25:09;01:25:13;"They would turn them in. They would be on vinyl in stores like weeks later."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Two weeks later."
01:25:14;01:25:17;"So just think about it. So bringing it all back home, the Bob Dylan album,"
01:25:17;01:25:20;"his first electric album came out March 22nd, '65."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"So they're probably like starting to..."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"They might not even been in the studio yet for Help,"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"but they're starting to gear up for that, working on Help,"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"and then they hear Bring It All Back Home for Bob Dylan."
01:25:29;01:25:32;"And you just picture subterranean blues,"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"and just picture it. You're the Beatles."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"You're some of the greatest songwriters of all time,"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"and you're even getting into new..."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Even Help, they are getting into new territory."
01:25:40;01:25:42;"Even the song Help, it's like..."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"That couldn't have been on the early..."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Help, I need somebody."
01:25:46;01:25:51;"You're trying to express this slightly more sophisticated emotion,"
01:25:51;01:25:55;"a type of anxiety, or something that you wouldn't have in I Want to Hold Your Hand."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"So you're working on that, and it is cool,"
01:25:58;01:26:01;"but then you just hear, ""Danny's in the basement mixing..."""
01:26:01;01:26:03;"I'm sure somebody with a different vantage point could say,"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"""No, no, that I think helps way cooler."""
01:26:05;01:26:08;"But I'm saying at that time, you would just hear Bob Dylan's new record"
01:26:08;01:26:11;"opens with subterranean homesick blues."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"""Danny's in the basement thinking about the government."""
01:26:13;01:26:14;"You would just be like..."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"What the hell is this?"
01:26:15;01:26:18;"If you were cool, you'd probably feel a little bit behind."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"And then you start trying to catch up."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Then later that year, you write Norwegian Wood,"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"but then he's dropping like a rolling stone."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"And again, I'm not saying that the Bob songs are better."
01:26:26;01:26:31;"I'm just saying if you're kind of like an artsy, depressive type,"
01:26:31;01:26:34;"like a John Lennon, you'd probably just always feel a little bit like..."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"""Ugh."""
01:26:35;01:26:38;"You know, just like, ""Dude's on another level."""
01:26:38;01:26:40;"But people didn't feel that way in the late '70s."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"Track two on Greatest Hits, volume three."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"So this is interesting."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"So it opens with Tangled in Blue, totally normal."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"Then track two, Changing of the Guards."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Hell yeah."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"So this is a great song."
01:26:51;01:26:54;"One that actually I think your brother Dave introduced me to."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"I have this memory of when we all lived in a house in Brooklyn,"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"like when I was a teacher,"
01:26:58;01:27:03;"hearing Dave working on probably Rise Above."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"And I feel like he was always blasting--"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Sixteen!"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"He's always blasting Changing of the Guards."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"And at first I would kind of hear it through the floor"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"and I'd hear the saxophone and I'd be like, ""Is this Bruce?"""
01:27:12;01:27:14;"And then be like, ""What is it?"""
01:27:14;01:27:16;"Because I didn't know it was Street Legal at all."
01:27:16;01:27:20;"Anyway, Street Legal was not a particularly respected album for a long time."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"The heads love it now."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"So anyway, track two, he's already getting, you know, interesting."
01:27:25;01:27:29;"Changing of the Guards."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"And also, he's skipping ahead."
01:27:31;01:27:34;"He could easily have put out two songs from Blood on the Tracks."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"And then one from Desire."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"Yeah."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Sixteen."
01:27:39;01:27:42;"Banners united over the fields."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Sixteen Banners United Over the Fields."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"I love that."
01:27:46;01:27:58;"That was in his record?"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Two days ago."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Yeah."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"That was working."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Front to back?"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Front to back."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Blasting."
01:28:10;01:28:13;"He played this one a bunch in '78 and then never again."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"Oh, that's not a single concert since then."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"Yep."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Wow."
01:28:18;01:28:36;"I wonder what the problem was in 1978 with the rock critics."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Yeah, that they didn't like this?"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Why were they crapping on this so hard?"
01:28:39;01:28:44;"Bring up that Robert Criscale review of Changing of the Guards."

01:48:05;01:48:07;"I'm kind of like, I'm like a jock."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"I'm like a royal jock."""
01:48:09;01:48:10;"And you know, he's cheating on her"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"and being like a bad boy or something."
01:48:12;01:48:13;"Obviously, I don't really know what I'm talking about,"
01:48:13;01:48:17;"but I can say, because I was 10 years old in '94"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"and I wasn't familiar with like the discourse"
01:48:19;01:48:20;"about the royal family,"
01:48:20;01:48:23;"but I feel like especially with the Meghan and Harry era,"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"I feel like in my life, I've heard way more people have,"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"and ""The Crown"", way more people having conversations"
01:48:27;01:48:32;"about the weird duality of the royal family,"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"especially since the death of Diana,"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"which I think was in the late '90s."
01:48:35;01:48:39;"The idea that the royal family, on the one hand,"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"is these people with all this power,"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"but they're also human beings imprisoned."
01:48:44;01:48:48;"They're almost like imprisoned in a symbolic world"
01:48:48;01:48:49;"that they can't really escape"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"and they have to represent something."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"Anyway, to me, that's like conversations"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"that I've heard in my adult life."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"So, let's say the past 20 years,"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"there's just something about picturing Bob,"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"well, I guess he wrote in '89."
01:49:01;01:49:04;"It's picturing Bob in '89, just thinking about Prince Philip,"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"of all people, this is before all the drama with Diana,"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"just Bob thinking about Prince Philip"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"as he's meditating on the concept of dignity"
01:49:11;01:49:14;"and imagining a circumstance where Prince Philip"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"was like a nervous mob informant"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"who wanted to talk to him and said,"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"""I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't use my name."""
01:49:21;01:49:23;"And Bob's like, ""What is it, Prince Philip?"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"I've been abused by dignity."""
01:49:26;01:49:29;"It weirdly tracks with this modern royal family."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Just the fact that even on Bob's mind,"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"this idea of a member of the royal family"
01:49:33;01:49:36;"feeling like he's flipping the concept of dignity now"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"as being an imposing oppressive force."
01:49:39;01:49:42;"And for some reason, he's thinking about Prince Philip."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"- Well, Prince Philip has to maintain"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"a sense of decorum and dignity."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"That's the job."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"- Which in his case, literally means"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"being a professional boyfriend,"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"professional quiet boyfriend."
01:49:53;01:49:57;"- Yeah, and maybe not pursuing what's really in your heart."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"- Right."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"- You have to maintain the pose."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"- And this is the fact that, yeah,"
01:50:01;01:50:05;"that Bob's truly hitting dignity from every side."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"- I met Jeffrey Epstein the other day."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"(both laughing)"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"- Bob."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"- I asked him where his money's from."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"He said he didn't know."
01:50:13;01:50:14;"- What did you know, Bob?"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Whoa, okay, hold on."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"Breaking news."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"- Breaking."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"- Breaking news that looks like about 30 years old."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"So Seinfeld, what did you just find out?"
01:50:22;01:50:26;"- So there's an article describing a 1996 event"
01:50:26;01:50:30;"where Bob Dylan meets Prince Charles"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"and is seated next to him."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"This is part of a,"
01:50:34;01:50:37;"so the Prince of Wales has a youth-oriented charity"
01:50:37;01:50:40;"founded in '76 to help vulnerable young people"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"get their lives on track."
01:50:42;01:50:45;"There was an event where it was Dylan,"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Roger Daltrey, Pete Townsend, Ringo Starr,"
01:50:47;01:50:52;"Eric Clapton, Ronnie Wood for a concert in Royal Park."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"- All British people."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"- Mostly Englishmen, except for Bob."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"- Quote, ""Sometime during the day,"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"Dylan had the opportunity to meet the Prince backstage."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"An unsmiling, shade-wearing Dylan"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"along with Rolling Stones guitarist,"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Ronnie Wood, greeted the Prince."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Also in a star-studded photo op,"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"Dylan was sat directly next to Prince Charles."
01:51:09;01:51:12;"The pair can even be seen exchanging a few words"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"in the video below,"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"although the exact transcript is unclear."""
01:51:16;01:51:17;"- A mysterious moment."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"We'll never know what words were spoken between them."
01:51:20;01:51:21;"Mr. Dylan, I quite--"
01:51:21;01:51:22;"- Hello, Bob."
01:51:22;01:51:26;"- I quite enjoyed ""Dignity"" off your greatest hits,"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"volume three."
01:51:27;01:51:31;"The line about my father, it's quite humorous."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"- Quite perceptive there, Mr. Bob."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"- I also feel like same with the Robert Hunter in ""The Dead."""
01:51:36;01:51:38;"I always can't help but clock moments"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"when these lyricists and songwriters"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"who are so all-American,"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"and so like their whole world is like"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"in the American mythical place."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Anytime they like step out,"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"just like talk about the British royal family,"
01:51:52;01:51:55;"the same way as I've said many times on the show, I think,"
01:51:55;01:51:59;"the only Grateful Dead song that takes place in England"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"is ""Scarlet Begonias."""
01:52:01;01:52:04;"Anyway, ""Dignity."""
01:52:04;01:52:05;"- That's a good one."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"- ""Dignity,"" great song."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"And again, like I can't fully explain it,"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"but somehow the logic of putting ""Dignity"""
01:52:10;01:52:12;"on his greatest hits, volume three, makes sense."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"I really feel like there's something about this"
01:52:14;01:52:18;"where I'm getting a sense of like Bob Dylan's worldview in '94."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"He wanted you to hear ""Changing of the Guard."""
01:52:20;01:52:22;"He wanted you to hear ""Groom Still Waiting at the Altar."""
01:52:22;01:52:24;"He wanted you to hear ""Dignity"" and ""Joker Man."""
01:52:24;01:52:29;"Like somehow that was reflecting his, where he was at."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"The song after ""Dignity,"""
01:52:30;01:52:32;"I guess he's played this live a lot,"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"but again, I feel like most people"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"outside of real Dylan heads don't know this."
01:52:35;01:52:38;"What's your familiarity with this one, Jake Silvio?"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"- I don't have a lot of familiarity with this one."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"This was new to me when I listened"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"to ""Greatest Hits, Volume Three"" the other day."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"- When you threw it on V3?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"- It was new to me."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"- So this is ""Silvio."""
01:52:52;01:52:57;"♪ Spank my future on a hell of a pad ♪"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"- So this is off ""Down in the Groove,"""
01:53:00;01:53:02;"which came out in '88,"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"another pretty poorly received album."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"♪ Seen many times, but who has not ♪"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"♪ Silvio, silver and gold ♪"
01:53:09;01:53:13;"♪ Won't buy back the beat of a heart-grown coal ♪"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"♪ Silvio, I gotta go ♪"
01:53:16;01:53:21;"♪ Find out something, or be dead man now ♪"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"- Love that mandolin."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"- Yeah, and the sound of this,"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"well, Jake, you might have already looked this up,"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"I don't know, but it came out in '88."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Can you think of any records"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"from roughly in this time period"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"that this sounds like?"
01:53:32;01:53:33;"- ""In the Dark""?"
01:53:33;01:53:36;"- Yes, yes, 'cause doesn't this sound"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"so much like an ""In the Dark""?"
01:53:38;01:53:39;"- Yeah."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"- Or even a ""Built to Last"" type song?"
01:53:40;01:53:41;"- Oh yeah."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"- Because it's like,"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"I feel like this is when like the--"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"- Maybe more ""Built to Last."""
01:53:45;01:53:48;"- So, which are the last two ""Grateful Dead"" albums"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"for anybody who's been living under a rock."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"(laughing)"
01:53:51;01:53:54;"But like, 'cause I feel like this era,"
01:53:54;01:53:55;"like ""Built to Last"" and stuff,"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"the late '80s were when some of the '60s guys,"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"well, the Dead had sat out most of the '80s,"
01:54:00;01:54:01;"but when some of the late '60s guys"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"had finally figured out how to like tastefully use"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"some light '80s production techniques,"
01:54:06;01:54:09;"but keep it kind of light and bouncy."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"- Yeah, a little like Steve Winwood vibes too."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"- Yeah, it's like this is--"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"- Back in the high life kind of vibe."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"- Totally, where it's like,"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"it's the best mix of '80s recording techniques"
01:54:18;01:54:21;"with Rootsy Bon, or even, I mean, honestly--"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"- The show."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"- Even, oh, Bruce Hornsby, oh yeah."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Right, but he was a younger dude,"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"so he had that--"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"- True, true."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"- He had more insight."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"- That's true."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"- In some of the old heads."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"But I would even say like Graceland has a touch of that,"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"like just because he has like the Zydeco song on it,"
01:54:35;01:54:38;"where, but one cool thing about Silvio,"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"so not only does it remind,"
01:54:39;01:54:42;"reminiscent of the last Two Grateful Dead records,"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"this song was co-written by Robert Hunter."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"- Oh wow."
01:54:45;01:54:48;"- And on backup vocals on this song,"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Jerry, Bob, and Brent."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"- Well, they're about to go tour."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"- Yeah, so they're about to do the Dylan and the Dead tour."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"So this is almost like the smallest little taste"
01:54:58;01:55:01;"we could get of if they'd made a studio album together,"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"Dylan and the Dead, it might have sounded like this."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"- His voice sounds so strong here though,"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"where I feel like, I don't know,"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"maybe it's the recording of it,"
01:55:08;01:55:11;"but that Dylan and the Dead, just, he sounds so bad."
01:55:11;01:55:14;"I mean, his voice doesn't sound nearly as strong"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"and this is way within the ear."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"- Yeah, maybe, yeah, but I was live and probably--"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"- I wish Jerry was playing guitar on this."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"- I mean, missed opportunity."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"(Jerry scatting)"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- I mean."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"(Jerry scatting)"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"(all laughing)"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"- Jerry would have torn it up on this."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"- I mean, we need it."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"- Also, the name Sylvia just makes me think of the Sopranos."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"(all laughing)"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"- This one could have been on Desire, kind of,"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"the songwriting."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"- Oh yeah, yeah, right, yeah, with the '70s production?"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"- Yeah. - Totally."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"♪ Sylvia, silver and gold ♪"
01:55:51;01:55:54;"- Yeah, I've never heard this one down on the groove."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"It's one that's oft referenced on the Jokerman pod."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"- Do they like it?"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"- Oh yeah."
01:55:59;01:56:02;"I mean, the whole Jokerman mindset is just like,"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"we've all heard the '60s stuff a million times,"
01:56:04;01:56:05;"we're not gonna talk about that."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"- Right."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"- Let's go deep on Knocked Out, Loaded,"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"and Down on the Groove."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"- Down on the Groove."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"(all laughing)"
01:56:12;01:56:15;"- But this is one of those albums I still have never cracked."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"- Maybe Sylvia is your way in."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"I also do kind of love--"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"- I think it is."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"- I think it's pretty cool,"
01:56:21;01:56:22;"a cool element of Bob too,"
01:56:22;01:56:25;"is that he's one of the best songwriters"
01:56:25;01:56:26;"and lyricists of all time,"
01:56:26;01:56:30;"but he would just write with other people every now and then."
01:56:30;01:56:33;"And famously on Desire,"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"he wrote with that guy Jacques Levy,"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"and they wrote these epic stories together."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Later we'll hear Brownsville Girl,"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"which he co-wrote with the playwright and actor Sam Shepard."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"- Oh, I didn't realize that."
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Okay, I didn't--"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"- But then Sylvia, it's cool just like Bob,"
01:56:45;01:56:48;"for Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter to link up,"
01:56:48;01:56:51;"that's for a certain type of fan,"
01:56:51;01:56:52;"that's like Watch the Throne."
01:56:52;01:56:54;"- Yeah, no, that's too heavy."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"- Too heavy weight."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"- That's--"
01:56:56;01:56:57;"- Coming together."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"And then they wrote together--"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"- It's Ali and Foreman."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"- Yeah."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"(all laughing)"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"And then they did it again,"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"like in the 2000s,"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"on a much later album."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"- A Bob record or--"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"- Yeah, yeah, it's the one with Duquesne Whistle."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"- Oh yeah, yeah, that's Tempest."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"- Oh yeah, yeah, they linked up again on Tempest."
01:57:16;01:57:20;"So the two, Bob and Robert, together."
01:57:20;01:57:25;"So we're realizing that it's gonna take a bit longer"
01:57:25;01:57:26;"to get through all of Bob Dylan's greatest hits,"
01:57:26;01:57:27;"""Find 'Em 3,"""
01:57:27;01:57:28;"so we're gonna spill a little bit of it"
01:57:28;01:57:29;"into the next episode."
01:57:29;01:57:31;"Don't worry, we'll talk about other stuff too."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"It won't be all Bob."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"- Well."
01:57:34;01:57:35;"(all laughing)"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"- Famous last words."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"- We'll make sure there's some flights of fancy,"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"but I do think for the TC head,"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"especially the people getting a little burned out"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"on the corporate food history,"
01:57:44;01:57:47;"this is exactly what the doctor ordered."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"I know for a fact that at least,"
01:57:49;01:57:52;"I'm thinking at least 25 to 60% of TC heads"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"are casual Bob Dylan fans"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"who need a way into the later stuff."
01:57:56;01:57:59;"Nobody's ever said that, nobody's ever asked for it,"
01:57:59;01:58:01;"and yet I have that feeling."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"- Where to begin?"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"Well, we got you, folks."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"- We got you, folks."
01:58:04;01:58:06;"- Two-part TC extravaganza."
01:58:06;01:58:07;"- This is what ""Time Crisis"" is all about."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"- Bob Dylan, volume three."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"- Greatest hits."
01:58:10;01:58:11;"- Two-parter."
01:58:11;01:58:12;"- Volume three."
01:58:12;01:58:15;"Anyway, so we'll play one more song on this episode,"
01:58:15;01:58:22;"but join us in two weeks to talk more BDGHV3."
01:58:22;01:58:25;"That's Bob Dylan's greatest hits, volume three."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"My favorite Bob Dylan album."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"(laughs)"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"Just imagine that story like in some country"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"that never had Bob Dylan records,"
01:58:33;01:58:35;"and this is just like the first album anybody heard."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"It's like, ""Oh man, I always liked that album that he made."""
01:58:37;01:58:40;"Greatest, it's all over the place, but it's a cool record."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"Anyway, so this is like a pretty classic,"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"just like pretty Bob Dylan song."
01:58:44;01:58:47;"It almost reminds me of like Randy Newman or something."
01:58:47;01:58:48;"Do you know this one, Jake?"
01:58:48;01:58:49;"- Oh yeah."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"- So this one you're totally familiar with."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"- Yeah, I know ""Oh Mercy"" pretty well."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"- You're an ""Oh Mercy"" head?"
01:58:52;01:58:53;"- Yeah."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"- So he threw this one on, ""Ring Them Bells."""
01:58:55;01:58:57;"- Yeah, this is a really pretty one."
01:58:57;01:59:05;"Yeah, that side B of ""Oh Mercy"" is..."
01:59:05;01:59:10;"♪ Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams ♪"
01:59:10;01:59:11;"- That's a real nice frame."

01:59:32;01:59:34;"- I think you're right on your theory"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"on how he put this together."
01:59:36;01:59:39;"Like there's a lot of lyrical themes"
01:59:39;01:59:40;"that weave in and out."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"- Right."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"- 'Cause he could have put on like ""Most of the Time"""
01:59:43;01:59:45;"or ""Political World"" on this record."
01:59:45;01:59:46;"- Yes, uh-huh."

02:01:22;02:01:23;"- Catherine of Siena."
02:01:23;02:01:24;"- Mm."
02:01:24;02:01:26;"- Saint Catherine, a lay member of the Dominican Order,"
02:01:26;02:01:29;"was a mystic, activist, and author"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"who had great influence on the Italian literature"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"and Catholic Church."
02:01:32;02:01:34;"- I think Bob's a real history head."
02:01:34;02:01:36;"- Oh, yeah, totally."
02:01:36;02:01:38;"Early Roman kings."
02:01:38;02:01:40;"- That's a song I definitely heard about"
02:01:40;02:01:41;"from Joker Man pod."
02:01:41;02:01:42;"- Yeah."
02:01:42;02:01:43;"- What album is that on?"
02:01:43;02:01:45;"- You caught me on the spot here, I'm not sure."
02:01:45;02:01:48;"- Ring, it's the same one with Duquesne Whistle."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"- Oh, Tempest."
02:01:50;02:01:52;"- Have you listened to Tempest, the song?"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"- No, I made like a mental note after listening to Joker Man,"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"I was like, I'm gonna go deep on Tempest."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"- Maybe after we, next episode,"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"when we finish Bob Dylan, Greatest Hits, Volume 3,"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"we dive into Tempest."
02:02:02;02:02:05;"- Basically, this time series will just become Joker Man."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"- Yeah, we're just gonna steal their thunder."
02:02:07;02:02:08;"- I mean, they've moved on."
02:02:08;02:02:10;"- Yeah, they moved on to Velvet Underground,"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"so we'll just start doing..."
02:02:12;02:02:13;"(laughs)"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"And, you know, we'll pay, with all due respect,"
02:02:15;02:02:18;"we'll say like, you know, when we list the materials"
02:02:18;02:02:21;"that the avid listener needs to understand the episode,"
02:02:21;02:02:24;"we'll say, you know, listen to the Bob Dylan album Tempest,"
02:02:24;02:02:27;"check out these five Joker Man pods,"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"read these books, we recommend all of that"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"as you listen to the Time Crisis episode."
02:02:31;02:02:33;"Well, let's go out on early Roman kings,"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"'cause this is like some Bob blues."
02:02:38;02:02:39;"- That's right."
02:02:42;02:02:44;"- All right, we'll be back to finish"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"Greatest Hits, Volume 3."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"Remember, this song is not on Greatest Hits, Volume 3,"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"but Bob is a history buff,"
02:02:51;02:02:52;"and maybe you didn't know that he wrote a song"
02:02:52;02:02:55;"called Early Roman Kings in the 2000s."
02:02:55;02:02:56;"- Now you do."
02:02:56;02:02:57;"- All right, talk soon."
