00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again"
00:02;00:06;"This week we talk about baseball"
00:06;00:09;"the sport and"
00:09;00:13;"The bubblegum"
00:13;00:20;"We also listen to great music from the Doobie Brothers Kim Petras Sam Smith and Barbara Streisand"
00:20;00:25;"All this plus special guest Chris Baio on this week's"
00:26;00:30;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:48;01:17;"Time"
01:17;01:23;"Crisis back again. Got Jake and Seinfeld. Oh, and here we are right up in the first"
01:23;01:29;"minute of the show. Joined by Chris Bale. What's up? How's it going? Can you hear me?"
01:29;01:37;"Yeah. Loud and clear. Beautiful. Yeah. Beautiful view behind you. Where are you? I'm at home."
01:37;01:43;"Okay, cool. Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles, sunny Los Angeles, California on my deck."
01:43;01:50;"Welcome back to Time Crisis. We had the idea to have you call in because to talk a little"
01:50;01:56;"bit about baseball, time it kind of sucks, but actually maybe it's perfect. We can reflect"
01:56;02:02;"on this season. So first of all, for people who don't know, your first cousin, Harrison"
02:02;02:11;"Bader is on the Yankees. Yeah. Yeah. So appreciate the invite, honor and a privilege to return"
02:11;02:18;"to this show as always. No question, but I've never, I don't know if we've ever, if I've"
02:18;02:22;"ever come on the show to discuss sports. Have you guys had a lot of sports related guests"
02:22;02:27;"at this point? We've never had a guest just to talk sports. I mean, the show definitely"
02:27;02:33;"veers into sports talk. I think just because it's like adjacent to music, you always get"
02:33;02:39;"a little bit of sports, a little bit of cars, sometimes whiskey on rare occasions, but you're"
02:39;02:44;"the first time we've ever had somebody call in just to talk sports. And I will say that"
02:44;02:51;"I definitely think of you as a major sports guy in my life. Cause I don't know too many"
02:51;02:57;"guys who truly follow sports. I guess before we even talk about Harrison and baseball,"
02:57;03:01;"anybody who knows you knows that you were, you're really passionate about is hockey."
03:01;03:08;"Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And, uh, I grew up in New York Rangers fan. My dad had season"
03:08;03:16;"tickets, went to so many games and I kind of had like a relative lull in following it."
03:16;03:20;"Like, you know, we got super busy, we'd be touring all the time, but I'd still always"
03:20;03:27;"like check out how the team was doing, but sort of since the pandemic started and I really"
03:27;03:34;"had very little to do for long stretches of time, I've become truly obsessive about hockey"
03:34;03:38;"on a level even beyond, you know, what it was like growing up, I would say, I just didn't"
03:38;03:47;"know. I mean, I remember like the, the Rangers were on their Stanley cup run in 2014 when"
03:47;03:51;"we were on tour for modern vampires of the city. And I got to like fly to New York on"
03:51;03:56;"a bunch of off days just to go see some sports. And I would say even since then, I'm like"
03:56;04:02;"more hardcore about hockey, but I was still pretty diehard, uh, Rangers fan. Definitely."
04:02;04:10;"Can you name everybody on the team? Uh, very easily. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I got a question"
04:10;04:16;"for everybody for Jake and Seinfeld. Can you guys name one player in the NHL currently"
04:16;04:23;"in the whole NHL? No, no, not a single. Wow. Can you Seinfeld? You're Canadian. I know"
04:23;04:28;"I never, I didn't really watch a lot of hockey. I played hockey when I was a kid, but we didn't"
04:28;04:33;"really, I didn't really watch it, but I did want to ask, do you remember when Fox made"
04:33;04:37;"the decision to highlight the hockey pots when you were watching till about highly controversial?"
04:37;04:42;"Absolutely. It was, it was the scourge of hockey and it set the game back years and"
04:42;04:46;"years and years by having like trying to do like a strike zone or like a first downline"
04:46;04:52;"they try to do with hockey, but they put like this glow globe to make the puck look bigger,"
04:52;04:57;"but it just looked insane. And the game is too fast for it to like actually translate"
04:57;05:02;"to television. So it was a despicable decision by Fox that should live down in shame. It"
05:02;05:07;"was basically live animation on the, around the puck. They just should have made the puck"
05:07;05:13;"bigger. Wow. That would have been, as somebody who wasn't really a fan of the sport, I think"
05:13;05:18;"I was like the one person who liked it. Cause I was like, Oh, now I can see the puck. Yeah."
05:18;05:24;"I get what you're saying. And it's, it's tricky because we're living in a, the peak era of"
05:24;05:29;"high definition television and it's only going to get better and better. So, you know, thinking"
05:29;05:35;"about nineties resolution and nineties animation, I do understand why that was attempted, but"
05:35;05:41;"it just, you know, it made, it was more alienating than inclusive ultimately, I would say."
05:41;05:45;"Thank you. Anyway, that was a departure. Yeah. Neither Jake or I can, can name the current"
05:45;05:46;"player."
05:46;05:48;"A single NHL player."
05:48;05:51;"Is Mark Messier still on the Rangers?"
05:51;05:57;"No, he's been retired for about 20 years, but it's good that he's retired. But so you're"
05:57;06:02;"saying he never suits up, never stops by and suits up."
06:02;06:09;"He doesn't stop by and suit up, but he does do a between period analysis on TV. So he's"
06:09;06:14;"still a good presence. He looks exactly the same as he did when he was a player. He looks"
06:14;06:18;"incredible, but, um, good for him. Yeah. Yeah. He looks great."
06:18;06:23;"He was the Lays spokesperson for, for a little while, or he was doing a series of Lays potato"
06:23;06:25;"chips for a bit."
06:25;06:31;"Oh yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, we're getting into like large, large scale hockey culture,"
06:31;06:35;"but after the Rangers won in 94, which was a very exciting time for me, I was nine years"
06:35;06:41;"old. You would see, you know, Messier and the Rangers being so many TV commercials on"
06:41;06:45;"like a cultural level that it feels like will probably, you know, never happen again for"
06:45;06:47;"the sport. I would say."
06:47;06:50;"The cultural ubiquity kind of peaked in the nineties for hockey."
06:50;06:54;"Yeah. And you know, the people talk about the game growing and they're, they're trying"
06:54;06:58;"a bunch of different stuff, but I would say that's probably the peak and granted I'm,"
06:58;07:02;"that's coming from a diehard Rangers fan. Like, and I try not to be like a New York"
07:02;07:07;"chauvinist in general, you know what I mean? Right. But yeah, I think that's probably fair."
07:07;07:10;"Because people really hate New York sports teams."
07:10;07:12;"I think that's fair to say. Yeah."
07:12;07:18;"It's the evil empire and people particularly hate the Yankees, which is always been a little"
07:18;07:22;"bit hard for me to understand. I guess when I take the, the big view, I can see, oh, there"
07:22;07:26;"was the Yankees were also like excellent in the nineties. That's when people really started"
07:26;07:27;"to hate them. Right."
07:27;07:33;"I think it's a combination. Now, one thing I love about hockey and we can get deep into"
07:33;07:38;"sports, it's a hard cap league. So that means that every team can't go over a certain number."
07:38;07:43;"Whereas in baseball, if you want to spend as much money as possible, you can, there's"
07:43;07:49;"like a luxury tax, but you know, some teams have quadruple the amount of money fielding"
07:49;07:53;"their players as other teams kind of at the discretion of the owners. So the Yankees would"
07:53;08:00;"just spend the most and had the most sort of like dominating run of, you know, any baseball"
08:00;08:04;"team. I think they have the, and again, I'm more of a hockey guy ultimately before we"
08:04;08:08;"go even on our deep dive and Harrison, but like, I'm pretty sure by a long margin, they"
08:08;08:14;"have the most world series titles. 23, I think. Yeah. Crazy. Well, yeah, of course that's"
08:14;08:18;"going to rub the rest of the country the wrong way. Even though to me, when I think about"
08:18;08:23;"the Yankees, I guess people also picture New York's, they picture like rich wall street"
08:23;08:30;"guys or something. Whereas pinstripes and the pinstripes. Yeah, exactly. Pinstripes"
08:30;08:35;"on wall street executives, pinstripes on the team. Whereas I, and I imagine you too, Bayo"
08:35;08:38;"growing up, you grew up particularly close to there. I always think they're the Bronx"
08:38;08:42;"bombers. I always think like, I don't, I understand it, but I always think it's like the Bronx."
08:42;08:47;"Oh, that's like where, that's where my dad's from. That's where my grandparents live. You"
08:47;08:53;"know, you see the subway go past the stadium. It felt more like kind of like funky and cool"
08:53;08:58;"or something. Not like I get like Madison square garden, for instance, that's like on"
08:58;09:03;"top of Penn station. It's in the middle of Manhattan. You can kind of feel like you're"
09:03;09:06;"in the center of the world. I always felt like with the Yankees, it's like they're from"
09:06;09:10;"the Bronx. It's cool. But of course I recognize they have a lot of money. It's a complicated"
09:10;09:16;"dynamic. Definitely. I stay up all night. I go to sleep watching Dragnet. You never sleep"
09:16;09:21;"alone because Jimmy is the magnet. I'm so rope. They call me Mr. Robo when the troubles"
09:21;09:28;"arise. You know, I'm the cool copa on the market score. Just like the Yankees get over"
09:28;09:33;"on this country like my main man, Snaggy, the young lady. I don't need to tell you. So"
09:33;09:39;"what is that? I got lucky. I brought home the key. But before I got busy, I slipped"
09:39;09:45;"on the meat. You can't get better odds cause I'm a short thing. Primary. So turning and"
09:45;09:49;"rolling like a ring thing. Jump the turns down there. But they, they told it in the"
09:49;09:58;"new. I tell you, you're busted with the payroll. Customs jails me over. Oh, some rat weed and"
09:58;10:03;"out of your back door. I'll meet you another. Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your"
10:03;10:08;"mother. Not perfect grammar. Oh, perfect timing. The Mike stands for money and the D is for"
10:08;10:15;"diamond. All right. So let's talk about Harrison. So I guess my first question is, have you"
10:15;10:21;"done any press about the fact that your cousin is on the Yankees or been asked to? I only"
10:21;10:25;"asked this because I was kind of surprised to see that Harrison going to the Yankees"
10:25;10:32;"is such a big deal that even some music publications wrote about your connection to him. Yeah."
10:32;10:38;"So to answer a question you asked me a little bit earlier, I'm first cousins. My first cousin"
10:38;10:44;"is Harrison, Harrison Bader. He grew up in the same square mile town as me, Bronxville."
10:44;10:49;"He's 10 years younger than me, but he made it to major league baseball. He played for"
10:49;10:55;"the St. Louis Cardinals in, uh, he made, he got called up in 2017 I think. And he was"
10:55;11:01;"there for five years putting together a very impressive career. He won the gold glove last"
11:01;11:06;"year, which is the best person in his league, in his position. He's a center fielder. But"
11:06;11:11;"yeah, then at the, at the trade deadline, it's kind of interesting in June, I was talking"
11:11;11:17;"with my dad and he told me like, Oh, you know, the Yankees are kind of interested in Harrison."
11:17;11:21;"And like, I have no idea on what level, like how a player knows if another team is interested"
11:21;11:25;"in them. But I was like, Oh wow, that'd be kind of cool if he, if they traded for him"
11:25;11:28;"or whatever, but I didn't, I didn't think much of it. And then he got injured and he"
11:28;11:32;"was in a boot for awhile. So I kind of thought he was just going to be on the Cardinals for"
11:32;11:39;"the rest of the season. And then we were on tour in Japan this summer. And I just, I woke"
11:39;11:45;"up like the day of the baseball trade deadline. And I had like 20 different texts from like"
11:45;11:49;"friends and family. And it was people just sort of like talking about how at the trade"
11:49;11:55;"deadline, the St. Louis Cardinals sent Harrison to the Yankees in exchange for a pitcher."
11:55;12:02;"And it did get picked up a bit in the music press. Pitchfork wrote an article about it."
12:02;12:08;"And I think it is the distinction of advanced baseball metrics being on Pitchfork for the"
12:08;12:14;"first time in the publication's history, because they started talking about some of his like,"
12:14;12:16;"like advanced stat numbers."
12:16;12:22;"Wait, for the non-sports nuts. Can you just more slowly explain what I think I understand,"
12:22;12:25;"but what are advanced baseball metrics are?"
12:25;12:30;"Like money ball, you know, people have seen money ball, but the kind of things that are"
12:30;12:35;"weighed and I don't even know what this, there's so many of them. You can go to like baseball"
12:35;12:40;"reference.com and there's letters that I have no idea what on earth they stand for."
12:40;12:41;"War."
12:41;12:46;"What? Yeah, war. I know war, but do you know what WRC plus is?"
12:46;12:47;"No."
12:47;12:52;"I don't either. I have no idea what WRC plus is."
12:52;12:54;"When you're talking about advanced baseball metrics, I think you're going to say like"
12:54;12:55;"RBI."
12:55;12:59;"No, that's not advanced. That's basic, bro."
12:59;13:02;"RBI is a basic baseball metric."
13:02;13:08;"RBI's go back to the beginning of the game. We're talking ****."
13:08;13:13;"Like the money ball era, the kind of like supercomputer era."
13:13;13:20;"Exactly. The stat revolution. So one example is war that Jake brought up is wins above"
13:20;13:28;"replacement. And basically what that means is how many wins a player is worth in the"
13:28;13:35;"overall season to his team. And like if you have seven or eight, you're like one of the"
13:35;13:41;"most elite baseball players. Like I think, you know, Aaron judges war number was something"
13:41;13:46;"kind of crazy like that on the Yankees this year. So that one I can kind of wrap my head"
13:46;13:51;"around, but WRC plus, which was in the pitchfork article. I don't understand what that is."
13:51;13:56;"Wow. That's amazing. The pitchfork article reference WRC plus."
13:56;14:03;"It's weighted runs created plus. That doesn't help me."
14:03;14:09;"Weighted runs created. And it's funny because I said you guys are telling me RBI is entry"
14:09;14:16;"level basic, but in my community of people who only vaguely follow baseball, RBI and"
14:16;14:21;"maybe you guys have had these conversations too. RBI is famously a talking point where"
14:21;14:26;"somebody will say, what the hell is an RBI? You know what I mean? Like people who like,"
14:26;14:31;"I think I understand baseball, but what the hell is an RBI? You're speaking Greek to me."
14:31;14:37;"So it's funny to imagine the people in the, I don't understand RBI community being confronted"
14:37;14:44;"with war and RCW plus their heads would explode. Yeah. It was interesting to sort of, sort"
14:44;14:49;"of see those advanced stats. And I would actually be curious if someone could find previous"
14:49;14:56;"examples of advanced baseball stats being in music news stories, but it was very, very"
14:56;15:00;"cool. There was a hold steady review from 2007 that, that had, there was an extended"
15:00;15:07;"metaphor that involved advanced baseball. Do you guys have a guess on who has the highest"
15:07;15:15;"WRC plus in baseball history? Baseball history, Barry Bonds. Nope. I thought you were going"
15:15;15:23;"to say in vampire weekend. It's Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth has the most career weighted runs"
15:23;15:32;"created with all right. 2,727. And you know what's sad is that that man went to his grave,"
15:32;15:39;"not knowing what WRC plus meant. That is the true tragedy. Picture Babe, like whaling on"
15:39;15:47;"a hot dog, smoking a cigar, being like, what the hell? What the hell is WRC plus? In my"
15:47;15:52;"day, we just, we just hit the ball. RBI runs, whatever. Wait, have you guys ever talked"
15:52;15:57;"about how George Harrison will never know that here comes the sun has the most streams"
15:57;16:04;"of any Beatles song? No, but okay. Sorry. I don't mean to derail. Yeah. Yeah. Although"
16:04;16:12;"he did, I guess he had the, George would have known that in the first two years post Beatles,"
16:12;16:17;"he had the best selling solo album. Yeah. Yeah. So he had that feather in his cap. So"
16:17;16:22;"hopefully in the late nineties, if he ever met kind of like a tech futurist who said,"
16:22;16:27;"you know, man, one day, one day your record collection, all your CDs, it'll just be in"
16:27;16:32;"an, in a little application on a smartphone. He might've been able to kind of picture that."
16:32;16:37;"So what do you mean? You just, you'll be able to click any song you want. The guy said,"
16:37;16:40;"yeah, absolutely. So he said, maybe he might've said, so some songs will have more streams"
16:40;16:48;"than others. Yeah, man, I would keep my eye on here comes the sun if I was you."
16:48;16:52;"♪ Here comes the sun ♪"
16:52;16:54;"♪ Here comes the sun ♪"
16:54;16:59;"♪ And I say, it's all right ♪"
16:59;17:06;"♪ Darling, it's been a long, long, long day ♪"
17:06;17:12;"♪ Darling, it feels like ♪"
17:12;17:16;"♪ Since it began ♪"
17:16;17:20;"♪ Here comes the sun ♪"
17:20;17:23;"♪ Here comes the sun ♪"
17:23;17:26;"♪ And I say, it's all right ♪"
17:26;17:33;"- Due to your familial relationship with Harrison,"
17:33;17:36;"advanced baseball metrics got into pitchfork"
17:36;17:38;"for potentially the first time."
17:38;17:40;"And I think that speaks to not only the fact"
17:40;17:42;"that it's just like, it's just cool"
17:42;17:46;"that two talented guys in wildly different fields"
17:46;17:48;"in the same family, but also, but here's the thing,"
17:48;17:50;"here's what's interesting is that Harrison"
17:50;17:52;"had been a baseball player for five years"
17:52;17:55;"and there hadn't been, of course I knew about it."
17:55;17:58;"It was, you wore his jersey when we played St. Louis."
17:58;18:01;"There was like an excitement knowing that your cousin"
18:01;18:05;"who also was a young kid in the Oxford comma video,"
18:05;18:08;"another fun fact, had made it to the MLB."
18:08;18:11;"And yet there's something so crazy"
18:11;18:12;"about him being on the Yankees"
18:12;18:15;"that it really kicked it to the next level."
18:15;18:20;"- It's truly like a dream come true for everybody."
18:20;18:22;"And you know, the season now we're talking,"
18:22;18:24;"the season ended on Sunday night."
18:24;18:27;"They got eliminated by the true villains of baseball,"
18:27;18:32;"the Houston Strohs, but like he had an unbelievable playoffs."
18:32;18:36;"He had five home runs in nine games."
18:36;18:39;"He like played the baseball of his life."
18:39;18:40;"You know, when he got traded,"
18:40;18:41;"'cause he got traded in, I guess,"
18:41;18:43;"end of July, beginning of August."
18:43;18:47;"You can't buy like a Harrison Bader Yankee jersey."
18:47;18:50;"So when he got traded, my dad printed up a bunch of them"
18:50;18:52;"and he and all my aunts and uncles would,"
18:52;18:55;"they went to like every single home game"
18:55;18:56;"all wearing Bader jerseys."
18:56;18:57;"And people would come up to them being like,"
18:57;18:59;"""Oh, where'd you get that?"""
18:59;19:01;"And my dad was like, ""Oh, I got the maid."""
19:01;19:02;"And they were like, ""Oh, do you know him?"""
19:02;19:03;"And they were like, ""Oh yeah, we're his family."""
19:03;19:06;"Like, you know, it was just a very, very cool thing."
19:06;19:08;"But I don't know, my uncle Louis,"
19:08;19:10;"I just, he was so baseball obsessed."
19:10;19:14;"He was so like really, really athletic."
19:14;19:16;"And it's been like, you know, it's been interesting."
19:16;19:17;"There've been all sorts of articles"
19:17;19:19;"about him playing for the Yankees."
19:19;19:20;"Now there was like a really great article"
19:20;19:23;"in the New York Times about his sort of like travel team"
19:23;19:25;"and how he got into Dominican food"
19:25;19:26;"when he was in high school."
19:26;19:27;"And like sort of stuff I never knew about him"
19:27;19:30;"or knew about my family, like talking about,"
19:30;19:32;"you know, my aunt Janice was apparently"
19:32;19:33;"a really good basketball player when she grew up."
19:33;19:36;"And I'm like getting this really cool opportunity"
19:36;19:38;"to learn more about my family."
19:38;19:39;"And like, I don't know, it's just,"
19:39;19:41;"it's really, really cool."
19:41;19:44;"And not that aunt Janice knew"
19:44;19:46;"that I was gonna be talking to you this week,"
19:46;19:50;"but like on Tuesday, she sent me a text message"
19:50;19:51;"and it was a picture of Harrison"
19:51;19:55;"and my aunt Janice were driving to Yankee Stadium"
19:55;19:58;"to pick up all his stuff 'cause his season's over."
19:58;19:59;"And there was like a little picture."
19:59;20:00;"It was him driving with the stereo"
20:00;20:02;"and they were listening to Oxford Comm"
20:02;20:03;"on the way to Yankee Stadium,"
20:03;20:05;"on the way to like get all his stuff."
20:05;20:07;"And just like, I don't know,"
20:07;20:09;"I get a little emotional talking about it"
20:09;20:11;"because it is like a dream come true"
20:11;20:14;"and it's really like wonderful thing for our family."
20:14;20:16;"And, you know, I didn't have the opportunity"
20:16;20:17;"to go to any of these playoff games,"
20:17;20:20;"but like next year I'll definitely like go to New York"
20:20;20:22;"and, you know, see a bunch of games and stuff."
20:22;20:23;"- It's really amazing."
20:23;20:25;"I've got so psyched about it too."
20:25;20:27;"I was like waking up in Japan,"
20:27;20:29;"just like first thing in the morning,"
20:29;20:32;"like looking at the score, telling everybody about it."
20:32;20:33;"The Yankees are exciting."
20:33;20:35;"And this is a Yankees program"
20:35;20:37;"because Jake supported the Yankees."
20:37;20:38;"- Oh, hell yeah."
20:38;20:39;"- Whatever it was that Jake."
20:39;20:40;"- Dark days, dude."
20:40;20:45;"I mean, late, late eighties, early nineties."
20:45;20:46;"- Oh yeah."
20:46;20:48;"- 1990, they lost over a hundred games."
20:48;20:49;"- Oh wow."
20:49;20:52;"- You know, my childhood hero was Don Mattingly."
20:52;20:53;"- Same."
20:53;20:54;"- Who, you know, really Nick?"
20:54;20:55;"That was your guy?"
20:55;20:57;"- Yeah, I was really into the Yankees"
20:57;21:00;"and I grew up in DC as you know,"
21:00;21:02;"and the Orioles were our team,"
21:02;21:05;"but my family was from New York and I was,"
21:05;21:08;"yeah, I think I really identified, you know,"
21:08;21:11;"as a New Yorker, even though I wasn't, you know,"
21:11;21:14;"but my whole family was there and Mattingly was my guy."
21:14;21:16;"That mustache, get out of here."
21:16;21:19;"- And he, you know, he had an amazing run for a few years,"
21:19;21:21;"but by the time I was really into baseball,"
21:21;21:24;"when I was like 12 and 13, circa '89, '90,"
21:24;21:27;"he had a bad back injury."
21:27;21:30;"He never really recovered to his mid eighties glory."
21:30;21:34;"And then yeah, in '96, when they went down O2"
21:34;21:36;"against the Braves in the series"
21:36;21:37;"and they came back and won four in a row,"
21:37;21:39;"like I was a freshman in college"
21:39;21:42;"and it was like very emotional."
21:42;21:44;"I was very fired up."
21:44;21:45;"- That's also before Jake,"
21:45;21:49;"you had fully completed the transition to a West Coast guy."
21:49;21:51;"So you're this young dude from Connecticut,"
21:51;21:55;"East Coast tri-state guy in a dorm in Portland, Oregon."
21:55;21:56;"- Yep."
21:56;21:58;"- Just so excited about the Yankees."
21:58;21:59;"- Oh yeah."
21:59;22:00;"It's beautiful."
22:00;22:02;"- No, it's really amazing."
22:02;22:04;"And also like, just so people understand too,"
22:04;22:06;"where you and Harrison grew up, Bronxville,"
22:06;22:09;"I mean, it's, obviously the name is connected to the Bronx"
22:09;22:11;"where obviously the Yankees play."
22:11;22:14;"How long is the drive from your childhood home"
22:14;22:16;"to Yankee Stadium?"
22:16;22:19;"- Under, there's no traffic under 15, I think."
22:19;22:19;"- Wow."
22:19;22:23;"- Maybe 15, and he went to Horace Mann, which is like--"
22:23;22:24;"- In the Bronx."
22:24;22:27;"Like he, and he grew up a huge Yankees fan."
22:27;22:30;"It's like, yeah, it's unreal."
22:30;22:33;"- And also just generally speaking,"
22:33;22:36;"one thought I had when you were talking about"
22:36;22:39;"how in hockey, there's a cap for how much"
22:39;22:42;"the teams can spend, but baseball's a little bit insane"
22:42;22:44;"'cause one team can have so much more money."
22:44;22:46;"I've always had this thought about sports"
22:46;22:49;"'cause I love regional variety and I love, you know,"
22:49;22:53;"regional culture, and I always wondered,"
22:53;22:54;"it's never gonna happen, but wouldn't it be cool"
22:54;22:58;"if you had to be from a certain radius of the stadium"
22:58;22:59;"to play for the team?"
22:59;23:00;"- That'd be awesome."
23:00;23:01;"- That'd be so sick."
23:01;23:02;"- That'd be amazing."
23:02;23:04;"- And the Yankees would still probably be really good,"
23:04;23:06;"but anyway, that begs the question,"
23:06;23:09;"how many New Yorkers or even just tri-state guys"
23:09;23:11;"are on the Yankees?"
23:11;23:11;"- I have no idea."
23:11;23:13;"Not many."
23:13;23:17;"The first baseman is great player, Anthony Rizzo,"
23:17;23:20;"who my dad made friends a bit with his family"
23:20;23:22;"'cause they were sitting together during some of the games."
23:22;23:25;"He grew up in Florida, but he grew up a Yankee fan,"
23:25;23:28;"so I know at least one other player grew up"
23:28;23:30;"as a big Yankee fan, but tri-state,"
23:30;23:34;"I don't know how many, like who from Westchester"
23:34;23:35;"made it into Major League Baseball?"
23:35;23:38;"I'm sure I'm omitting somebody else"
23:38;23:39;"that's playing right now, but it is like,"
23:39;23:41;"not, you know, not many."
23:41;23:44;"- You might not be omitting anyone else."
23:44;23:45;"It wouldn't surprise me if your cousin"
23:45;23:49;"was the only current Westchester County player."
23:49;23:51;"- Suffice to say, it's an unusual story."
23:51;23:54;"How many guys on the Astros grew up 15 minutes"
23:54;23:56;"from minute maid?"
23:56;23:58;"Is that what it's called?"
23:58;24:01;"How many guys on the Astros grew up 15 minutes"
24:01;24:03;"from the minute maid stadium?"
24:03;24:05;"And also, yeah, so just to fully understand,"
24:05;24:07;"so when Harrison got traded,"
24:07;24:08;"the season was well underway, right?"
24:08;24:10;"So how many-- - Yeah, it was the trade"
24:10;24:13;"deadline and he was injured, so there was still,"
24:13;24:15;"you know, it was in August, so there was still"
24:15;24:16;"about two months left in the season,"
24:16;24:19;"but he really only came back when there was like"
24:19;24:21;"20 games left in the last like three weeks"
24:21;24:24;"of the regular season, so the playoffs is really"
24:24;24:27;"where he like, kind of like came alive"
24:27;24:29;"and like everybody got to know him and stuff."
24:29;24:31;"- And that's such a crazy story too,"
24:31;24:35;"just to be a new guy on a team and in the playoffs,"
24:35;24:38;"which obviously get a lot more eyeballs"
24:38;24:40;"and people are excited and nervous,"
24:40;24:42;"in your first playoffs on a new team,"
24:42;24:44;"to hit how many home runs?"
24:44;24:46;"- He hit five home runs in nine games"
24:46;24:48;"and this season, in the regular season,"
24:48;24:50;"he had five home runs in 82 games,"
24:50;24:53;"so he like played the baseball of his life"
24:53;24:55;"playing for the Yankees, you know, it's, yeah."
24:55;24:58;"- And now his home runs are colloquially known"
24:58;24:59;"as baiter bombs."
24:59;25:02;"- They do call them baiter bombs, definitely."
25:02;25:05;"- Can you buy a baiter jersey now?"
25:05;25:07;"- You know, I'm sure they're gonna be for sale soon,"
25:07;25:09;"but not the last time I checked."
25:09;25:11;"- Is your uncle selling them?"
25:11;25:15;"- Oh, no, yeah, my dad, my dad, I'm sure my dad--"
25:15;25:16;"- Family bootleg business."
25:16;25:18;"- Yeah, yeah, family bootleg, like a little bootleg stall"
25:18;25:21;"in Yankee Stadium with my entire family"
25:21;25:23;"selling bootleg baiter jerseys."

26:57;27:00;"The Strohs are the current kind of like,"
27:00;27:02;"they're the evil empire now in baseball."
27:02;27:03;"- Oh yeah, they're in the World Series"
27:03;27:05;"for the fourth time in six years."
27:05;27:07;"- I have to admit, full disclosure,"
27:07;27:09;"that I have rooted for the Strohs before,"
27:09;27:10;"so I had mixed feelings."
27:10;27:11;"(laughing)"
27:11;27:15;"Of course, my allegiance to the Bronx Bombers took precedent,"
27:15;27:19;"but when the Strohs played the Dodgers in the World Series,"
27:19;27:21;"I can't remember if you were there, Bayo,"
27:21;27:23;"and I remember CT was,"
27:23;27:26;"I went to an event with a lot of people we know"
27:26;27:28;"to watch the game, and I looked around,"
27:28;27:31;"and I saw people like our dear friend Ariel Rechsheid,"
27:31;27:34;"real LA guys wearing their Dodgers jersey,"
27:34;27:37;"and I just saw so many bandwagon Dodgers fans,"
27:37;27:40;"and I saw myself as like the East Coast guy living in LA,"
27:40;27:42;"and I said, ""I can't root for these guys."
27:42;27:43;"""That's bad energy."""
27:43;27:45;"It's not that I don't like the Dodgers."
27:45;27:48;"I don't wanna be this, I can't root for them."
27:48;27:49;"You know what I mean?"
27:49;27:50;"I don't wanna be like a-- - No, you weren't, yeah."
27:50;27:54;"- So then it left me no choice but to root for the Strohs,"
27:54;27:56;"and I think I played a small part"
27:56;27:57;"in creating the spiritual momentum"
27:57;28:02;"to help them win that year. - Oh yeah, definitely."
28:02;28:05;"- So what do we have to look forward to next year?"
28:05;28:06;"(laughs)"
28:06;28:07;"- Next year, oh, looking forward?"
28:07;28:10;"You know, a full season of healthy Harrison Bader"
28:10;28:15;"and Centerfield, which, you know, again, be amazing."
28:15;28:16;"I have to go 'cause I'm leaving,"
28:16;28:18;"but I did wanna tell you very quickly"
28:18;28:19;"one other sporting event,"
28:19;28:21;"'cause the hockey season just started."
28:21;28:24;"The Rangers, we're on a little bit of a shaky start"
28:24;28:26;"the last few games, but I think it's important,"
28:26;28:28;"you know, now that I'm the sports correspondent"
28:28;28:31;"for the show, the worst team in NHL hockey"
28:31;28:34;"is the Arizona Coyotes for many years,"
28:34;28:37;"and they were having financial troubles,"
28:37;28:41;"so the city of Glendale, Arizona kicked the Coyotes"
28:41;28:43;"out of their arena last year,"
28:43;28:46;"and so the Arizona Coyotes are building a new arena"
28:46;28:49;"that's gonna take like four or five years,"
28:49;28:52;"but in the meantime, they're playing this year,"
28:52;28:55;"next year, and the year after at a college hockey arena"
28:55;28:59;"at Arizona State University, and it just opened,"
28:59;29:02;"and it's called Mullet Arena, and it's, you know,"
29:02;29:06;"it's 25% the size of a regular hockey arena,"
29:06;29:09;"but the Rangers are playing there on Sunday,"
29:09;29:10;"and it's my birthday this weekend,"
29:10;29:12;"so I am gonna drive to Tempe, Arizona"
29:12;29:16;"to see the Rangers play in Mullet Arena on Sunday."
29:16;29:18;"I've likened it, it's kinda like,"
29:18;29:20;"gonna be like seeing Rolling Stones at Echoplex,"
29:20;29:24;"just like seeing a (beep) hockey team in a small venue."
29:24;29:26;"I'm like so beyond excited for it."
29:26;29:28;"- This is like very New Jersey trasher,"
29:28;29:30;"was it, yeah, the trashers."
29:30;29:31;"- Oh yeah, yeah, definitely."
29:31;29:34;"- The Connecticut trasher vibe."
29:34;29:35;"- Yeah, definitely."
29:35;29:37;"- And I also, I just love that, well, first of all,"
29:37;29:40;"I love an underdog story, so I'm gonna be sending"
29:40;29:43;"some positive energy to the Coyotes this season."
29:43;29:45;"- Yeah, send some love to the Yotes."
29:45;29:46;"The Yotes could use some love."
29:46;29:47;"(laughing)"
29:47;29:49;"Shout out to the Yotes, but that's,"
29:49;29:51;"yeah, that's awesome that you get to see the Rangers there"
29:51;29:52;"and just to pay, I mean, honestly,"
29:52;29:55;"it's kinda like a Vampire Weekend experience."
29:55;29:58;"We sold out the Garden, 360, two nights later,"
29:58;30:02;"we played at a club in Montreal, both great shows."
30:02;30:03;"- Absolutely."
30:03;30:05;"- And the Rangers, they played the Garden,"
30:05;30:08;"now they're playing a college arena."
30:08;30:10;"- Mullet Arena. - Mullet Arena."
30:10;30:12;"- All right, well, have a great time out there."
30:12;30:15;"Thanks so much, Chris, we'll talk to you soon."
30:15;30:16;"- Good to see everybody."
30:16;30:17;"- Happy birthday, Chris."
30:17;30:18;"- Have fun, man. - Thank you."
30:18;30:19;"- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday."
30:19;30:20;"- Peace."
31:25;31:32;"- It's funny, I was getting excited about the Yankees"
31:32;31:34;"at the tail end of this season,"
31:34;31:36;"just talking a little bit with my family."
31:36;31:39;"Like, you know, like I said, my dad's from the Bronx,"
31:39;31:41;"grew up going to visit my grandparents' apartment"
31:41;31:44;"in the Bronx, and so there's always a little bit of talk"
31:44;31:45;"about the Yankees, but we're not much"
31:45;31:48;"of like a sports family, you know?"
31:48;31:49;"So I remember my grandma would say,"
31:49;31:52;"""Oh yeah, I used to, I would listen to the Yankees game"
31:52;31:54;"""on the radio while I ironed."""
31:54;31:57;"And I was like, ""Okay, just like something to vibe out."""
31:57;31:59;"So I was asking my dad, I was asking my parents,"
31:59;32:03;"like, 'cause they've probably both been to, you know,"
32:03;32:05;"a very small handful of professional sporting events"
32:05;32:09;"in their whole lives, and yet for both of them"
32:09;32:14;"being proper Tristaters, some of the only sporting events"
32:14;32:15;"they've ever seen were Yankees games."
32:15;32:18;"So my mom had some memory of going as a little girl,"
32:18;32:21;"and my dad said that there's a famous story"
32:21;32:23;"with my older cousins who had a memory"
32:23;32:27;"of going to a Yankees game with their parents"
32:27;32:29;"and their uncle, my father, in the '70s,"
32:29;32:31;"when he was 20-something."
32:31;32:32;"It became an inside joke for them"
32:32;32:34;"about how my dad brought a book,"
32:34;32:36;"and that was always their-- - Oh my gosh."
32:36;32:39;"- Their memory of going to the Yankees game,"
32:39;32:42;"and their kind of like young uncle brought a book."
32:42;32:43;"- Like he's sitting there in the bleachers"
32:43;32:44;"reading like ""Froost."""
32:44;32:46;"(laughing)"
32:46;32:48;"- I had no idea what book."
32:48;32:51;"Maybe it was a book about baseball, who knows?"
32:51;32:54;"- So needless to say, you did not go to Yankee games"
32:54;32:57;"regularly as a kid with your folks."
32:57;32:57;"- Oh, definitely not."
32:57;32:59;"No, 'cause my parents would be like,"
32:59;33:03;"what's the, it's a schlep, it's noisy, whatever,"
33:03;33:05;"but I still felt some allegiance to the Yankees"
33:05;33:07;"just being like, oh, that's where, yeah, dad's from,"
33:07;33:09;"Bronx, all right, you know, drive past the stadium,"
33:09;33:13;"that kind of stuff, and then just as time went on,"
33:13;33:15;"I didn't know anybody who was into the Mets,"
33:15;33:16;"so even just as time went on,"
33:16;33:19;"just like other kids in New Jersey or something"
33:19;33:20;"would have tickets."
33:20;33:24;"So yeah, I remember going to a Yankees game"
33:24;33:26;"for my dear friend Wes, who's the singer"
33:26;33:29;"of ""Raw Riots"" birthday, probably it's like 11th birthday"
33:29;33:31;"or something, we all piled in a car"
33:31;33:33;"and went to a Yankees game."
33:33;33:34;"That was exciting."
33:34;33:36;"But all right, next year,"
33:36;33:39;"we can really follow the Yankees season."
33:39;33:41;"This is a Yankees show."
33:41;33:42;"Seinfeld, you got any reason"
33:42;33:44;"why you can't support the Yankees?"
33:44;33:45;"- None at all."
33:45;33:46;"I'm all in."
33:47;33:48;"You know, it's impossible to watch,"
33:48;33:52;"it's impossible to watch Dodgers games in LA"
33:52;33:54;"if you don't have cable, which I don't,"
33:54;33:56;"and I will not be getting."
33:56;33:58;"So, but I could watch Yankees games."
33:58;34:01;"I can get the MLB package and they won't be blacked out"
34:01;34:03;"because it's not my local market."
34:03;34:06;"So let's get in on the Yankees next year."
34:06;34:08;"- All right, very exciting."
34:08;34:10;"Gonna buy four bootleg Harrison Bader jerseys."
34:10;34:13;"Have them ready for next summer."
34:13;34:14;"- Merry Christmas, guys."
34:14;34:16;"- Yeah, Merry Christmas."
34:16;34:18;"(laughing)"
34:18;34:20;"All right, so this is a baseball episode."
34:20;34:22;"I guess it's also a Halloween episode, so."
34:22;34:23;"- Yep."
34:23;34:24;"- For people who are more interested"
34:24;34:27;"in the corporate food history side of TC,"
34:27;34:30;"we're not gonna talk about Big League Chew."
34:30;34:31;"(gunshot)"
34:31;34:31;"- It's time for--"
34:31;34:33;"- Corporate Food History."
34:33;34:34;"(gunshot)"
34:34;34:36;"Let's talk about it."
34:36;34:38;"(mimicking gunfire)"
34:38;34:42;"- Big League Chew, it's one of those funny things."
34:42;34:43;"So for anybody who doesn't know,"
34:43;34:45;"it's a type of bubble gum"
34:45;34:49;"that is modeled after chewing tobacco, right?"
34:49;34:52;"So it's like shredded bubble gum."
34:52;34:53;"It's really sweet."
34:53;34:54;"I always liked the grape flavor"
34:54;34:57;"and it comes in kind of a big pouch"
34:57;35:01;"with a cartoon caricature of a baseball player on it."
35:01;35:04;"It's such a weird kind of product."
35:04;35:06;"It's one of those things that,"
35:06;35:09;"it always felt like a little bit bootleg to me."
35:09;35:10;"You know what I mean?"
35:10;35:11;"Like a product like Big League Chew,"
35:11;35:14;"it wouldn't shock me if you met somebody"
35:14;35:16;"from another part of the country and you're like,"
35:16;35:17;"did you like Big League Chew growing up?"
35:17;35:19;"And they'd be like, what are you talking about?"
35:19;35:21;"I've never heard of it."
35:21;35:22;"And yet, I don't think that's the case."
35:22;35:26;"It feels very regional and weird and small."
35:26;35:28;"And yet everybody seems to know it."
35:28;35:31;"So did all you guys grew up chewing Big League Chew?"
35:31;35:32;"- Absolutely."
35:32;35:35;"I've never chewed a Big League in my life."
35:35;35:36;"I don't think they have it where I'm from."
35:36;35:39;"- Okay, so you think they didn't have it in Montreal?"
35:39;35:40;"- No."
35:40;35:43;"Nationwide, I don't think they had it in Canada."
35:43;35:44;"- Interesting."
35:44;35:46;"But Jake, in Connecticut,"
35:46;35:48;"you were chomping on some Big League Chew?"
35:48;35:49;"- I have the opposite feeling about it."
35:49;35:52;"I feel like it was like the coolest,"
35:52;35:55;"sexiest version of gum as a kid."
35:55;35:59;"- The gum itself comes in, it is like tobacco."
35:59;36:02;"It is in tiny, thin little strips."
36:02;36:05;"It also has, it sort of like has this sort of dust over it."
36:05;36:09;"So it's like, has an interesting sort of tactile feel"
36:09;36:11;"like you were supposed to pick it up like tobacco,"
36:11;36:14;"bunch it together and put it in your mouth."
36:14;36:15;"- Right."
36:15;36:18;"- How many times have you chewed tobacco, Nick?"
36:18;36:20;"- I would probably say three times."
36:20;36:22;"- I'm right around there too."
36:22;36:24;"- Never dip, I couldn't dip."
36:24;36:26;"- Oh, I thought that was dip."
36:26;36:28;"- Yeah, I thought that was dipping."
36:28;36:32;"- No, no, dip is actually where you put it."
36:32;36:34;"Dip is like a skull."
36:34;36:36;"You put it underneath your lip"
36:36;36:39;"and it's sort of a tobacco you almost suck on."
36:39;36:42;"- And chewing tobacco you use your teeth and chomp on it?"
36:42;36:43;"- Yeah, and then you keep it"
36:43;36:45;"sort of in the back of your mouth."
36:45;36:46;"- And spit. - And spit."
36:46;36:48;"- Oh, there's two different products."
36:48;36:49;"- Two different products."
36:49;36:50;"- Okay."
36:50;36:53;"- And tobacco I've done, maybe have you dipped me?"
36:53;36:55;"You know, you'd also see people, you'd see them."
36:55;36:56;"- The tin."
36:56;36:58;"- You'd see the tin and they'd even have like,"
36:58;36:59;"you know, I remember in high school vividly,"
36:59;37:03;"like the cool kids would have the,"
37:03;37:04;"like in the back of their jeans,"
37:04;37:09;"they'd have like a circle where their skull tin would be,"
37:09;37:11;"you know, so the outline of that."
37:11;37:14;"But yeah, chewing tobacco is like a baseball thing."
37:14;37:15;"It's sort of like old wild west."
37:15;37:18;"You spit out into the canister"
37:18;37:22;"some gross kind of like brown spit."
37:22;37:23;"- I mean, you're spitting regardless."
37:23;37:27;"Dip, you have the empty 20 ounce of Coke bottle"
37:27;37:30;"and you're like, you're in the back of math class"
37:30;37:32;"and you just have that like two inches"
37:32;37:34;"of just like black liquid in the bottom"
37:34;37:37;"of a clear 20 ounce plastic bottle."
37:37;37:39;"- What are the rules in MLB now?"
37:39;37:42;"Are you allowed to dip and chew tobacco?"
37:42;37:43;"You can't."
37:43;37:43;"- No."
37:43;37:44;"- See, I always liked baseball"
37:44;37:46;"'cause I thought you let the players"
37:46;37:49;"have the most personality 'cause you could wear chains,"
37:49;37:51;"you can have jewelry, visible jewelry."
37:51;37:54;"- The last guy I really remember dipping"
37:54;37:57;"or like chewing tobacco in a crazy way was Dykstra."
37:57;37:59;"He was like, I remember in like mid nineties,"
37:59;38:03;"he had some crazy year where he was hitting like 400,"
38:03;38:05;"like well into like July."
38:05;38:07;"Like he was really having a hell of a season."
38:07;38:11;"And I remember just like watching like a Philly,"
38:11;38:13;"he was in the Phillies, watching like a Phillies game"
38:13;38:16;"and just like him, like he like had a base hit"
38:16;38:18;"and he was like leading off of first,"
38:18;38:20;"you know, just like egging on the pitcher"
38:20;38:21;"to throw back to first."
38:21;38:23;"And there was just a shot of like this,"
38:23;38:25;"in North, like close enough his face."
38:25;38:27;"And this is the enormous chunk of tobacco,"
38:27;38:30;"like dangling out the side of his mouth"
38:30;38:34;"and just like black liquid, just death juice,"
38:34;38:36;"just like, you know, just on his chin."
38:36;38:39;"And he was just like the nastiest guy."
38:39;38:41;"- There's a lot of positive benefits to nicotine."
38:41;38:43;"Obviously there's a lot of negatives."
38:43;38:45;"There's causes health problems,"
38:45;38:47;"but nicotine does, it makes you sharp,"
38:47;38:48;"gives you energy."
38:48;38:49;"It's like caffeine, right?"
38:49;38:50;"Gives you focus."
38:50;38:52;"- It's also got a smooth, cool flavor."
38:52;38:56;"- Absolutely."
38:56;38:57;"- TC doesn't like how people focus"
38:57;39:00;"on the negative aspects of nicotine."
39:00;39:02;"- We're fighting back."
39:02;39:04;"Was there ever a time where baseball players"
39:04;39:06;"smoked cigarettes?"
39:06;39:08;"- I was gonna say, I do like this idea of like--"
39:08;39:09;"- Probably in the dugout."
39:09;39:10;"- In the dugout."
39:10;39:11;"- Matt's nodding yes."
39:11;39:13;"So yeah, 'cause I could almost picture it,"
39:13;39:15;"like kind of like Keith Richards style,"
39:15;39:17;"but you're like an outfielder."
39:17;39:19;"You're smoking, you see the ball coming,"
39:19;39:21;"you got the cigarette in your mouth,"
39:21;39:24;"just like dangling and, or you're like a pitcher"
39:24;39:25;"and you're smoking a cigarette"
39:25;39:27;"and then you take the cigarette out of your mouth"
39:27;39:30;"and like stuff it into part of your glove for a second,"
39:30;39:32;"then pitch real quick, put it back in your mouth."
39:32;39:33;"'Cause if you were allowed to dip,"
39:33;39:35;"it seems only right that other guys"
39:35;39:37;"could choose to smoke a cigarette."
39:37;39:40;"- 2012 was the year that they outlawed tobacco."
39:40;39:41;"- Interesting."
39:41;39:42;"- Wow."
39:42;39:44;"- I wonder if RCW pluses went down."
39:44;39:46;"I wonder how that affected the stats."
39:46;39:48;"- I mean, the few times I've done dip,"
39:48;39:50;"like it's like a buzz."
39:50;39:52;"I mean, I'm assuming tobacco is the same way."
39:52;39:53;"- Yeah."
39:53;39:54;"- It's intense, man. - Well, I mean,"
39:54;39:55;"if you smoke a cigarette"
39:55;39:56;"and you hadn't smoked one"
39:56;39:57;"and you started feeling that high,"
39:57;39:59;"it's like that times like a thousand."
39:59;40:00;"- Yeah."
40:00;40:02;"- It's going directly into your bloodstream."
40:02;40:04;"It's also disgusting."
40:04;40:05;"- I remember like I was in a,"
40:05;40:08;"I was doing like an artist residency in Nebraska"
40:08;40:09;"and I was like, I went to this bar"
40:09;40:10;"in this small town in Nebraska"
40:10;40:12;"and I was like hanging out with these old dudes."
40:12;40:15;"I was like throwing on all this like,"
40:15;40:16;"it was one of those like,"
40:16;40:17;"it was like early internet jukebox."
40:17;40:20;"I was throwing on nothing but GPV in the jukebox"
40:20;40:22;"and it was like all these like 60 year old dudes"
40:22;40:24;"in Nebraska and they were like, ""Hey man."""
40:24;40:25;"And then like we went outside"
40:25;40:27;"and like they gave me some dip."
40:27;40:28;"And I just like-- - Whoa."
40:28;40:30;"- Threw a ton of it in my lower lip."
40:30;40:32;"We were like kind of like in the back,"
40:32;40:35;"like the back kind of area of the bar."
40:35;40:37;"And I was just like down in these like Miller lights"
40:37;40:38;"and just doing dip."
40:38;40:41;"And I was just like, ""Let's go, let's go."""
40:41;40:43;"Like a weird Nebraska night."
40:43;40:44;"- That's amazing."
40:44;40:45;"- That was my thing. - I'm impressed"
40:45;40:45;"you didn't throw up."
40:45;40:48;"- New Mountain Brews song, ""Weird Nebraska Night."""
40:48;40:49;"- ""Weird Nebraska Night,"" man."
40:49;40:51;"- You got them into Guided By Voices"
40:51;40:52;"and they got you in a dip."
40:52;40:54;"- I threw on ""How's My Drinking,"" I remember,"
40:54;40:56;"'cause we were all pretty hammered."
40:56;40:57;"(laughing)"
40:57;41:02;"♪ How's my drinking ♪"
41:02;41:08;"♪ I don't care about ♪"
41:08;41:14;"♪ Being sober ♪"
41:14;41:18;"♪ But I sure care about ♪"
41:18;41:23;"♪ The sound ♪"
41:23;41:29;"♪ And the sound ♪"
41:29;41:38;"♪ And my truth is ♪"
41:38;41:43;"♪ Leave me down with you ♪"
41:43;41:47;"- See, I always thought growing up in the era"
41:47;41:50;"of anti-drug education,"
41:50;41:53;"and there was quite a bit of anti-tobacco education"
41:53;41:55;"happening, at least at my school,"
41:55;41:57;"I remember something that was really hammered"
41:57;42:01;"into our heads was the idea that,"
42:01;42:03;"oh, so you don't wanna smoke a cigarette"
42:03;42:06;"because you're scared that you might get emphysema"
42:06;42:08;"or lung cancer, so you're gonna dip."
42:08;42:10;"Oh, great idea."
42:10;42:13;"No, idiot, you're gonna lose your whole jaw."
42:13;42:14;"And then they would always show a picture"
42:14;42:16;"of a dude who had half his jaw missing."
42:16;42:19;"So I remember, I feel like year after year,"
42:19;42:21;"they always wanted to remind kids,"
42:21;42:23;"don't you think for a second"
42:23;42:25;"that you could dip your way out of this,"
42:25;42:27;"stay away from tobacco."
42:27;42:29;"And I remember even as a kid being like, yikes."
42:29;42:33;"All right, if I ever have to, I'll be a smoker."
42:33;42:34;"'Cause that seems worse."
42:34;42:37;"Losing half your jaw just seems pretty brutal."
42:37;42:38;"- Yeah."
42:38;42:40;"- Back to Big League Chew."
42:40;42:44;"The idea for Big League Chew came when a bat boy,"
42:45;42:49;"Todd Field, who was working for the single A team,"
42:49;42:54;"the Portland Mavericks, he had a pouch full of licorice"
42:54;42:57;"that he chopped up because he wanted to look cool"
42:57;43:00;"like one of the older ball players chewing tobacco."
43:00;43:02;"Interesting, just a guy who wanted to look cool"
43:02;43:04;"like a baseball player."
43:04;43:06;"He started kind of making his own."
43:06;43:10;"- Don't you appreciate the sort of very dishonest"
43:10;43:13;"assessment that tobacco's cool?"
43:13;43:15;"Just out of the gate."
43:15;43:16;"- I wanna be cool."
43:16;43:18;"- Well, this is 1980, too."
43:18;43:19;"I mean."
43:19;43:20;"- I understand, but it's still obvious."
43:20;43:22;"- Zero stigma."
43:22;43:25;"- But even with the stigma, there's just a thing where,"
43:25;43:26;"you know, everyone always says,"
43:26;43:28;"but I like this guy going, I wanted to be cool,"
43:28;43:33;"so I made it look like I chew tobacco, like the cool guys."
43:33;43:35;"- Right, mimetic desire."
43:35;43:39;"- I actually wanted to be Joe Camel at the time."
43:39;43:40;"- Right."
43:40;43:41;"It was all about cool."
43:41;43:44;"I mean, there's literally a cigarette called cool."
43:44;43:47;"So I guess this guy, Todd Field, and the pitcher"
43:47;43:50;"for the same single A minor league team"
43:50;43:52;"started working on it together."
43:52;43:54;"They bought a make your own bubble gum kit"
43:54;43:57;"from a company out of Arlington, Texas,"
43:57;44:01;"went to the supermarket and got flavor extracts"
44:01;44:02;"of maple and root beer."
44:02;44:04;"Is that something you just buy at the supermarket?"
44:04;44:06;"I guess like in the spice aisle,"
44:06;44:07;"they might have some little concentrate."
44:07;44:08;"- Definitely maple."
44:08;44:10;"- Yeah, maple, maple and root beer."
44:10;44:13;"- I made my first batch of what would become Big League Chew."
44:13;44:16;"I baked it in Bat Boy Todd Field's mom's kitchen."
44:16;44:17;"(laughs)"
44:17;44:21;"Just like, mom, the pitcher from that team"
44:21;44:25;"I'm the Bat Boy for is gonna come over on Saturday."
44:25;44:26;"Why?"
44:26;44:28;"We're gonna make bubble gum in the kitchen."
44:28;44:29;"All right, have fun."
44:29;44:32;"- Todd Field is 16 at this point."
44:32;44:37;"- Yeah, he's hanging out with 29 year old Rob Nelly Nelson."
44:37;44:40;"- Nah, 22."
44:40;44:41;"- Maybe, yeah, minor league team."
44:41;44:42;"- Single A ball."
44:42;44:44;"- He's like 21, 20."
44:44;44:45;"- Young dude."
44:45;44:46;"- Yeah."
44:46;44:47;"- And they're just cooking it up in the mom's kitchen."
44:47;44:49;"I mean, this is a classic story."
44:49;44:51;"I don't think this stuff happens that much anymore."
44:51;44:54;"Just a couple knuckleheads,"
44:54;44:57;"kind of like a kooky, weird origin story"
44:57;45:00;"and the first batch cooked up in mom's kitchen."
45:00;45:02;"That's old school American ingenuity."
45:02;45:02;"- That's classic."
45:02;45:04;"That's real Glenn Bell."
45:04;45:05;"- Yep."
45:05;45:06;"Today you need to learn,"
45:06;45:08;"you need to know how to code to get anywhere."
45:08;45:10;"- Today you need a PhD in chemistry"
45:10;45:14;"to get into the industrialized food game."
45:14;45:16;"- So many gatekeepers."
45:16;45:18;"Nobody's coming up with this stuff at home."
45:18;45:22;"So the original shredded R&D concept samples"
45:22;45:27;"of Big League Chew were brown to look like tobacco."
45:27;45:28;"- Oh, that's sick."
45:28;45:30;"- And were created from cutting sheets of gum"
45:30;45:32;"with a pizza cutter."
45:32;45:34;"So just make a big brown sheet of gum,"
45:34;45:37;"cut it up with a pizza roller thing."
45:37;45:38;"That's sick."
45:38;45:40;"So truly it was tobacco for children."
45:40;45:42;"(laughing)"
45:42;45:43;"- Todd's, shout out to Todd Field."
45:43;45:46;"- Then the idea was pitched to the Wrigley Company"
45:46;45:50;"and Wrigley gave them a three-year deal."
45:50;45:51;"They thought it would be a novelty"
45:51;45:54;"to add to their bubble tape and ouch brands."
45:54;45:55;"Well, 'cause what was ouch?"
45:55;45:58;"Ouch was like a fake bandaid."
45:58;45:59;"- Oh my God, ouch."
45:59;46:00;"I remember ouch."
46:00;46:02;"- Yeah, ouch was shaped like a bandaid container."
46:02;46:03;"- Yeah."
46:03;46:05;"- Yeah, ouch was good."
46:05;46:06;"- But the first year,"
46:06;46:07;"so they thought this would be a minor novelty,"
46:07;46:12;"but the first year they sold $18 million worth of gum."
46:12;46:13;"And this is a long time ago."
46:13;46:16;"So that's gotta be at least triple, quadruple."
46:16;46:18;"Currently Big League Chew is manufactured in the US"
46:18;46:23;"by Ford Gum and Machine Company in Akron, New York."
46:23;46:25;"Not familiar with Akron, New York."
46:25;46:27;"After taking over distribution rights from Wrigley"
46:27;46:30;"and moving production from Mexico at the end of 2010."
46:30;46:31;"Okay, made in America."
46:31;46:32;"- Respect."
46:32;46:34;"Reverse NAFTA."
46:34;46:37;"They're going from Mexico back to the US."
46:37;46:38;"I love it."
46:38;46:40;"- In an interview with Esquire Magazine,"
46:40;46:41;"Rob Nelly Nelson said,"
46:41;46:44;"""I like to say that my arm's not in the hall of fame,"
46:44;46:46;"but my gum is."
46:46;46:47;"It's not the way I thought I'd get in,"
46:47;46:49;"but I have no complaints."""
46:49;46:52;"- I wonder what that deal was that Rob Nelson"
46:52;46:55;"and Todd Field struck with Wrigley back in '80."
46:55;46:58;"- I don't really understand what a three-year deal,"
46:58;46:59;"because it can't be like you work for us."
46:59;47:02;"I guess it's like a three-year license of it."
47:02;47:06;"But then they must feel like they (beep) the bed."
47:06;47:09;"You can't renegotiate after three years"
47:09;47:11;"with an $18 million profit."
47:11;47:13;"- Wrigley should have bought it outright."
47:13;47:14;"- Yeah."
47:14;47:15;"- Probably back in 1980,"
47:15;47:17;"maybe people weren't thinking that way."
47:17;47:20;"Today, somebody brings you a new gum concept"
47:20;47:22;"with a lot of potential."
47:22;47:23;"You're sending Todd and Rob home"
47:23;47:26;"with $5 million each, full buyout."
47:26;47:28;"- Full buyout, yeah."
47:28;47:29;"Own that in perpetuity."

48:27;48:29;"Do you think it's like down or up?"
48:29;48:30;"- I like that we're really like"
48:30;48:32;"kind of burying the lead here though."
48:32;48:33;"- What is the lead?"
48:33;48:35;"- Todd Field."
48:35;48:36;"Do you know who that is?"
48:36;48:38;"- Wait, somebody else has the name Todd Field?"
48:38;48:39;"- Are you familiar?"
48:39;48:43;"Okay, Todd Field is like an acclaimed American film director."
48:43;48:44;"- Todd Field?"
48:44;48:48;"- He has a new movie out called ""Tar"" with Cate Blanchett,"
48:48;48:51;"which is a very austere three-hour movie"
48:51;48:53;"about a contemporary classical conductor."
48:53;48:56;"- So he parlayed his big league chew?"
48:56;48:59;"- Okay, like I went and saw the movie ""Tar."""
48:59;49:01;"I'm a Todd Field fan"
49:01;49:04;"because he released two movies in the early 2000s."
49:04;49:06;"One was called ""In the Bedroom."""
49:06;49:08;"- Oh my God, this is the same guy."
49:08;49:11;"- Yeah, and he made another movie called ""Little Children,"""
49:11;49:13;"which is an adaptation of a Tom Parada novel"
49:13;49:15;"with Cate Winslet."
49:15;49:16;"And then he kind of disappeared for a while."
49:16;49:20;"He's actually, he has a part in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as well."
49:20;49:23;"He plays the piano player"
49:23;49:26;"that Tom Cruise is old friends with in ""Eyes Wide Shut."""
49:26;49:28;"- I remember the movie ""In the Bedroom."""
49:28;49:30;"- Yeah. - Right."
49:30;49:32;"- He disappeared for a while, whatever."
49:32;49:33;"He has a new movie that I went and saw"
49:33;49:37;"at the Glendale Americana on Tuesday night with my brother."
49:37;49:40;"And it's like a two-hour, 45-minute,"
49:40;49:43;"very tense,"
49:43;49:48;"taut movie about a contemporary conductor"
49:48;49:50;"of classical music that gets canceled,"
49:50;49:52;"played by Cate Blanchett."
49:52;49:54;"Basically the opposite of big league chew."
49:54;49:58;"So then I got home and I was doing my classic,"
49:58;50:00;"and I'm like, let me like catch up on like,"
50:00;50:02;"let me read about Tar, let me read the review,"
50:02;50:04;"let me like read the Wikipedia page."
50:04;50:06;"Let me check in on the Todd Field Wikipedia page."
50:06;50:08;"What's this, early life?"
50:08;50:09;"Wait, what?"
50:09;50:12;"He was a bat boy for the Portland Mavericks,"
50:12;50:15;"and he co-created big league chew?"
50:15;50:18;"Yeah, I mean, what a journey."
50:18;50:19;"- I'm gonna see it."
50:19;50:20;"- You're gonna see Tar?"
50:20;50:21;"- I'm seeing it tomorrow."
50:21;50:25;"Should I bring some big league chew as like my movie snack?"
50:25;50:26;"- I think you should."
50:26;50:28;"- How was it? - Absolutely."
50:28;50:29;"- I thought it was great."
50:29;50:30;"- Okay, there's Oscar buzz."
50:30;50:31;"- All right, so this is interesting."
50:31;50:35;"Over 21 years, he's directed three films,"
50:35;50:37;"all of which have been critically acclaimed,"
50:37;50:40;"and he's been nominated for Academy Awards."
50:40;50:40;"- Yep."
50:40;50:41;"- Oh yeah, so he's a major dude."
50:41;50:42;"He's just been kind of quiet."
50:42;50:45;"So my question is,"
50:45;50:47;"how much money does he make off big league chew?"
50:47;50:50;"I pray that he gets royalty."
50:50;50:53;"Is it possible, is this the rare story"
50:53;50:54;"that you hear about somebody"
50:54;50:57;"with just an ungodly amounts of money"
50:57;50:58;"who actually does it right?"
50:58;51:01;"What would you do if, as a child,"
51:01;51:04;"you helped create a huge product"
51:04;51:07;"and you just received millions a year"
51:07;51:09;"without a mailbox money, without even thinking about it?"
51:09;51:10;"What would you do?"
51:10;51:12;"I mean, for some people, the idea might be,"
51:12;51:16;"well, I think I would dedicate myself"
51:16;51:18;"to an art that I'm really interested in,"
51:18;51:19;"such as filmmaking,"
51:19;51:21;"and I would only do it when I wanna do it."
51:21;51:23;"I wouldn't get caught up in the bull (beep)."
51:23;51:26;"I might sometimes take 16 years between projects,"
51:26;51:30;"and I would spend that time traveling the world on my yacht"
51:30;51:31;"in my private plane."
51:31;51:33;"I would do whatever I wanted."
51:33;51:36;"I would relax, and when I really had a great idea"
51:36;51:41;"for a film, such as ""Tar,"" about a canceled composer,"
51:41;51:43;"when the muse struck, I would get to work"
51:43;51:46;"and I would contact Cate Blanchett and we would do it."
51:46;51:48;"And then after that, I might disappear."
51:48;51:52;"I might be in Sri Lanka for 10 years, renting a mansion."
51:52;51:54;"But that's what I do."
51:54;51:57;"So maybe Todd Fields really has the ultimate life."
51:57;51:59;"- I mean, if I had to guess,"
51:59;52:03;"I would say that he doesn't have any royalty on it,"
52:03;52:04;"but I mean, I could be totally wrong."
52:04;52:07;"I mean, listen, if I was a journalist at Cannes"
52:07;52:10;"or whatever the, Van Ness or whatever,"
52:10;52:14;"whichever prestigious film festival movie premiered at,"
52:14;52:17;"I would be, first question out of my mouth,"
52:17;52:19;"Mr. Field, Jake Longstreth from ""Time Crisis."""
52:19;52:21;"(laughing)"
52:21;52:23;"I'm dying to know, what is your current status"
52:23;52:25;"with ""Big League Chew""?"
52:25;52:26;"Do you receive a royalty?"
52:26;52:30;"Was there a buyout back in 1980?"
52:30;52:31;"- I apologize for doubting you."
52:31;52:32;"- I wonder if he keeps it close to the vest."
52:32;52:34;"Oh yeah, you find anything, Seinfeld?"
52:34;52:37;"- You know, I was skeptical when Jake tweeted that fact"
52:37;52:40;"'cause I went on the ""Big League Chew"" website immediately"
52:40;52:44;"and Todd has not mentioned it all on the about page."
52:44;52:49;"It references Rob Nelson and Jim Bolton, but no Todd."
52:49;52:53;"And so we started talking about how this is sort of"
52:53;52:53;"a bit of a racer."
52:53;52:55;"It seems like he's been cut out of the story."
52:55;52:59;"There's a CBS This Morning feature on their website as well"
52:59;53:02;"where they go deep and no reference to Todd."
53:02;53:04;"Something must've gone down."
53:04;53:05;"There's a story there."
53:05;53:06;"- There's a few options here."
53:06;53:09;"I mean, he was a kid when he created it,"
53:09;53:12;"so it's possible that he just grew out of his love"
53:12;53:16;"of bubblegum and baseball, like many young men."
53:16;53:20;"And it's possible that even though he was receiving"
53:20;53:21;"this insane amount of money,"
53:21;53:23;"he had a good head on his shoulders."
53:23;53:25;"And around the time he was 16 or 17,"
53:25;53:27;"he's getting a little less into sports"
53:27;53:30;"and more into cinema."
53:30;53:31;"And he just realized, you know,"
53:31;53:32;"maybe he was about to go to college or something"
53:32;53:35;"and he just realized, I'm a cinema guy now."
53:35;53:40;"If I go down to the local independent movie theater"
53:40;53:43;"and I wanna talk about, you know, Fellini,"
53:43;53:47;"Kurosawa, whatever, and people are looking at me"
53:47;53:51;"as I'm the rich kid with the Big League Chew fortune,"
53:51;53:52;"they're gonna laugh me out of there."
53:52;53:56;"I wanna engage in cinema about the human condition."
53:56;53:59;"I want to give voice to the voiceless."
53:59;54:04;"I want to use the medium to explore humanity"
54:04;54:06;"and existential themes."
54:06;54:11;"And I don't think that being a 17-year-old billionaire"
54:11;54:14;"who created Big League Chew is good for my brand."
54:14;54:17;"So I'm gonna debt it."
54:17;54:19;"You know, maybe he dresses down, you know,"
54:19;54:22;"like he's kind of like a film bro,"
54:22;54:24;"probably not particularly fashionable."
54:24;54:26;"And maybe sometimes people go back to his house"
54:26;54:28;"or something and they say,"
54:28;54:30;"Todd, I thought you were just a working class film bro"
54:30;54:33;"like me, how do you live in a mansion?"
54:33;54:36;"And he'll say, all right, let me come clean."
54:36;54:37;"Here's my secret."
54:37;54:39;"So I could see him wanting to downplay it."
54:39;54:40;"And maybe they say, Todd,"
54:40;54:41;"you wanna do some press about Big League Chew?"
54:41;54:43;"And he said, of course I don't wanna do press"
54:43;54:44;"about Big League Chew."
54:44;54:48;"I'm gonna save all my press for my next feature film"
54:48;54:50;"that I've been, you know, working on for 10 years."
54:50;54:53;"I'm not gonna go blow that up, you know?"
54:53;54:55;"- Yeah, it's hard to think of a product"
54:55;55:00;"that's less sort of in line with a prestigious film career"
55:00;55:02;"than Big League Chew."
55:02;55:04;"- Right. - Just the name of it even."
55:04;55:07;"- He's sitting at Cannes,"
55:07;55:10;"talking to like Pedro Almodovar,"
55:10;55:13;"who's just like, can you explain Big League Chew?"
55:13;55:16;"And he's just like, oh my God, this is so embarrassing."
55:16;55:18;"He was like, I was nine years old"
55:18;55:21;"and I cut up some licorice."
55:21;55:22;"Oh my God."
55:22;55:23;"You know what's funny?"
55:23;55:27;"Speaking of cinema, this literally sounds like a story"
55:27;55:31;"from Magnolia, from like a Paul Thomas Anderson film."
55:31;55:36;"In fact, actually, I'm gonna try to find out"
55:36;55:39;"I'm gonna try to use my connections to find out."
55:39;55:42;"Hey Paul, are you aware of the fact"
55:42;55:45;"that your fellow director, Todd Field,"
55:45;55:48;"invented Big League Chew as a child when he was a bat boy"
55:48;55:50;"for a minor league Portland, Oregon team?"
55:50;55:53;"It just sounds like a story he would have made up."
55:53;55:54;"- It really is."
55:54;55:57;"Yeah, like the first sequence of Magnolia"
55:57;55:59;"when there's all those like really short,"
55:59;56:04;"like when like Pat Oswalt is like scuba diving"
56:04;56:06;"and gets picked up by the plane,"
56:06;56:07;"picking up water to put out forest fires"
56:07;56:10;"and ends up like in the top of the tree and scuba gear."
56:10;56:10;"- Oh yeah, yeah, right."
56:10;56:13;"- That whole sequence."
56:13;56:15;"I mean, I love, I mean, Todd Field apparently"
56:15;56:16;"had some sort of relationship with Kubrick."
56:16;56:19;"I mean, he acted in Eyes Wide Shut"
56:19;56:24;"and I think he had worked closely with him previous to that."
56:24;56:26;"And I just love the thing about Stanley Kubrick."
56:26;56:28;"I mean, at some point that must've come up."
56:28;56:31;"At some point, Stanley Kubrick is saying the words"
56:31;56:35;"Big League Chew to Todd Field."
56:35;56:37;"And then Tom Cruise is like, ""Hey, what's it say here?"
56:37;56:39;"""You mean a Big League Chew?"""
56:39;56:40;"I love that."
56:40;56:43;"- I think this is a more, I think this is a sadder story."
56:43;56:44;"- Where he got (beep)"
56:44;56:46;"- More sinister and I think he got (beep)"
56:46;56:47;"I'm reading this other article that says"
56:47;56:50;"Field couldn't have been older than 12 at the time."
56:50;56:53;"- No, this is all over the, he was born in '64"
56:53;56:56;"and Big League Chew, apparently this was in '80."
56:56;56:57;"- Yeah, well it came out in '80."
56:57;56:58;"So this could have happened when he was 12."
56:58;56:59;"It could have happened."
56:59;57:02;"- And that Nelson's--"
57:02;57:03;"- Screwed him over."
57:03;57:05;"- Nelson saw him and was like,"
57:05;57:06;"""What are you doing?"""
57:06;57:07;"He was like, ""Is that tobacco?"
57:07;57:09;"""I've never seen a 10 year old, you know,"
57:09;57:10;"""spitting tobacco."""
57:10;57:11;"- Chewing tobacco."
57:11;57:13;"- And he was like, ""No, this is gum."""
57:13;57:15;"And he was like, ""Hmm, interesting."""
57:15;57:17;"And that he just, I think, stole the idea."
57:17;57:20;"And I think that no one brings it up to Field"
57:20;57:22;"because you could be the biggest director in the world."
57:22;57:24;"You're telling me, Paul Thomas Anderson,"
57:24;57:26;"you're telling me Jerry Bruckheimer"
57:26;57:29;"doesn't want that Big League Chew money."
57:29;57:31;"I mean, just, you'd have to be upset."
57:31;57:33;"This is like an, what is it?"
57:33;57:36;"An, like, Breaking Bad."
57:36;57:40;"You know how he never did the partnership with--"
57:40;57:41;"- Jesse?"
57:41;57:42;"- Yeah, no, no, it's like--"
57:42;57:45;"- Those entrepreneurs, yeah."
57:45;57:46;"- Then he's like, ""I gotta go ask for money"
57:46;57:47;"""for his cancer treatment."""
57:47;57:48;"For at some point, he was like,"
57:48;57:50;"""I could have been an inventor of that thing."""
57:50;57:51;"- Right."
57:51;57:52;"- And I wasn't."
57:52;57:53;"- Right, right, right."
57:53;57:55;"- I think this is a different kind of traditional"
57:55;57:56;"Hollywood story. - Yes, I guess it's"
57:56;57:59;"totally possible that, I mean, it's really sad"
57:59;58:00;"that the first batch of Big League Chew"
58:00;58:03;"was made in the Field family kitchen,"
58:03;58:06;"but it's totally possible that, especially back then,"
58:06;58:09;"you could imagine that this guy was kind of like,"
58:09;58:11;"""Well, thanks for the idea, kid."
58:11;58:13;"""Now the grownups are gonna go see if we can"
58:13;58:13;"""turn into a business."""
58:13;58:16;"And he was like, ""All right, man, cool."""
58:16;58:17;"(laughing)"
58:17;58:19;"- I mean, maybe it's a thing where, like,"
58:19;58:21;"if you're a journalist and you're gonna do an interview"
58:21;58:23;"with Todd Field, his publicist is just like,"
58:23;58:26;"""Under no circumstances can you bring up Big League Chew."""
58:26;58:28;"Todd will end the interview if you bring up Big League Chew."
58:28;58:29;"- He will walk out."
58:29;58:32;"- He's sitting on stage at Lincoln Center,"
58:32;58:36;"next to Cate Blanchett, and they take some questions"
58:36;58:38;"from the audience."
58:38;58:41;"Just some weird old New York dude,"
58:41;58:42;"holding a plastic bag full of papers,"
58:42;58:44;"is like, ""I have a question, Mr. Field,"
58:44;58:45;"""about Big League Chew."""
58:45;58:46;"And he's just like, ""I'm outta here."""
58:46;58:49;"Cate Blanchett is like, ""What is Big League Chew?"
58:49;58:50;"""What happened?"
58:50;58:52;"""What is Big League Chew?"
58:52;58:54;"""What is he so angry about?"""
58:54;58:58;"Although, I do also love the idea that Stanley Kubrick,"
58:58;59:00;"who I believe is from the Bronx,"
59:00;59:01;"maybe he was a Yankees fan."
59:01;59:03;"- I'm sure he was. - Stanley Kubrick"

01:10:29;01:10:30;"kind of like, what do they call it?"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"Like a spinoff, I guess?"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"Like he did a chocolate bar called Big League Plug"
01:10:35;01:10:38;"that failed, which to me just goes to,"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"without the brilliance of Todd Field,"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"you don't know what you're doing with this product."
01:10:43;01:10:47;"- Truly, Todd Field was the mastermind."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"- He's the magic, heart and soul."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"- And also, Todd Field seems like he lays pretty low."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"In the only to do press for this new film, ""Tar,"""
01:10:57;01:10:58;"is he doing interviews."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"He hadn't spoken publicly for 16 years before that."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"It either means he was sitting there stewing"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"about big league chew,"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"or he was traveling the world on his mega yacht."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"I'm not sure."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"At some point, he was adapting"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"the Jonathan Franzen novel, ""Purity,"""
01:11:14;01:11:18;"into a 20-hour limited series for Showtime."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"But apparently, this would have been"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"one of the most expensive TV shows ever made."
01:11:23;01:11:28;"The budget was $170 million, and so Showtime bailed."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"And I imagine if Todd Field really had"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"that Big League Chew money,"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"he just would have gone out of pocket."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"- So?"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"- And dropped, $170 million would be chump change for him."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"He would say, ""You wanna do a 20-part"

01:12:16;01:12:19;"you just, no one's asked Todd in a long time,"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"and it does sort of start the story."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- Oh, I love that."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"It's kind of a framed narrative."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"It starts at the press conference,"
01:12:26;01:12:30;"and then over the next three hours and 27 minutes,"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"'cause this will be an epic film about America,"
01:12:33;01:12:38;"about capitalism, about meaning in the 20th century,"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"about ownership, over the next three and a half hours,"

01:13:07;01:13:09;"He doesn't even realize what he's getting into."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"- Yeah, this person spent the rest of their life"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"writing about Big League Chew."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"- Cate Blanchett plays herself."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"I also love the idea, yeah, because he's worked"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"with some really big name actors, Cate Blanchett,"

01:13:26;01:13:28;"We should ask Charlie Kaufman if he wants"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"to write this movie for us."

01:13:34;01:13:35;"- Beautiful."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"It's like tar."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- It's like tar."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"From the acclaimed director of ""Tar,"""
01:13:41;01:13:44;"finally gets personal with ""Chew."""
01:13:44;01:13:48;"- I also feel like that's such a classic."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"- And he can direct it."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"- It's such a famous director move."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"You know, when you're one of the top"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"international artistic directors,"
01:13:55;01:13:59;"eventually you have to make your film about your childhood."
01:13:59;01:14:00;"Like, I feel like all the attempts--"
01:14:00;01:14:01;"- You gotta make your Roma."
01:14:01;01:14:02;"- You gotta make your Roma."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"- Spielberg, right?"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Isn't the new Spielberg with Seth Rogen?"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"That's all about--"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"- That looks insane."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"That looks so terrible."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"I saw the preview for it."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"- Oh, no, is the trailer out?"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"- Oh my God, I've never heard of it."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"- It was called ""The Fable-mans."""
01:14:17;01:14:19;"I think it's called ""The Fable-mans,"" right?"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"- Oh my God, I was just squirming in my seat."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"- Oh, no."
01:14:23;01:14:27;"- Oh, it looks unwatchable."
01:14:27;01:14:30;"- Spielberg's Roma is not looking great."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"- The magic of movies,"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"like it's like a little kid at a drive-in"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"just being like, ""Oh my God."""
01:14:36;01:14:37;"- And he's earned it, okay?"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"- Making a super-hit movie."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"He's earned the right."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"- You can't make a movie about yourself."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"Like write a memoir."
01:14:45;01:14:49;"Like you don't make a movie depicting yourself"
01:14:49;01:14:53;"as like a budding genius."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"- People wanna know the story of ""The Fable-mans."""
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- No. - I'm in for it."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- It's brutal."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"- It's called ""The Spielbergs"" too."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"But also one of my favorite movies last year"
01:15:02;01:15:06;"is the Paolo Sorrentino film ""Hand of God."""
01:15:06;01:15:09;"I love Paolo Sorrentino, incredible Italian director."
01:15:09;01:15:12;"And his movie ""Hand of God"" is very well done."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"And it's a, no spoilers,"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"but some very difficult things happened"
01:15:18;01:15:21;"when he was a young man in his life."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"But it's still like a cool movie,"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"but it is kind of about,"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"it's a coming of age story about himself, basically."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"A young guy getting kind of interested in cinema"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"against the backdrop of Napoli where he grew up"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"and soccer and what was going on with his family."
01:15:36;01:15:40;"And it really is a thing that most great artsy directors"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"eventually do make their coming of age story"

01:17:15;01:17:17;"Bruno Mars, hell of a performer."
01:17:17;01:17:20;"Also, in case people don't totally realize this,"
01:17:20;01:17:24;"he truly is like one of the biggest pop stars on the planet."
01:17:24;01:17:27;"I don't know if he's extra popular in Japan,"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"but the show that we saw at the Tokyo Dome,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"which is a baseball stadium,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"it's where the Tokyo Giants play,"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"keeping it very baseball themed today,"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"it's gotta be at least like 40,000 people in there,"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"and he did five nights."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"- Wow."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"- Sold out."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"- Holy cow."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"- He's just a great performer."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"I mean, like the worst thing you could say"
01:17:47;01:17:51;"is that there's a little bit of like wedding band energy,"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"but if so, it's the greatest wedding band of all time."
01:17:54;01:17:58;"Just, you know, fun, keeping people really engaged."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"I don't think I realize what a good dancer he is."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"Just moving, just gliding across that stage."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- He's a whole package."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"I'm a fan."
01:18:05;01:18:05;"- He's great."
01:18:05;01:18:08;"I actually, you'd probably have a good time seeing him live,"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"and he's doing stuff from all over his,"
01:18:10;01:18:15;"from his whole career, really having a good time."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"Great night out."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"And the crowd just going absolutely nuts."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"But the amazing thing that I've always noticed"
01:18:21;01:18:24;"about Japanese crowds is that it's not that Japanese crowds"
01:18:24;01:18:29;"are quiet in that they don't cheer or applaud."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"Of course, they can, just like anybody, get really excited."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"But one thing that's awesome here,"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"and I've noticed that when we've played shows too,"
01:18:35;01:18:39;"is that in between moments when it's supposed to be quiet,"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"you don't have that din that you'd always have"
01:18:42;01:18:46;"at a show in the US, or just people (beep) talking."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"And so there's these moments in the show"
01:18:47;01:18:51;"where in a baseball stadium, 40 plus thousand people,"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"multiple times in the show,"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"it's like a thing that the Bruno Mars' band do"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"where he's like, they wanna get really quiet."
01:18:57;01:18:58;"And it's kinda cool."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"Like he goes, he's basically doing like shout,"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"like a little bit softer now, a little bit softer now."
01:19:03;01:19:04;"And they get really quiet."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"And at a certain point it goes full silence,"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"and the dudes are just kinda like dancing on stage"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"to nothing."
01:19:09;01:19:12;"And it's so wild that in a baseball arena,"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"truly you could hear a pin drop."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"- Wow."
01:19:15;01:19:19;"- It was as if not a single of the 40,000 people"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"were talking."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"So Bruno Mars is like, we're gonna get real quiet now."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"And then you just go, you're just watching the guys"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"kinda bouncing on stage without any sound."
01:19:26;01:19:27;"And it was totally silent."
01:19:27;01:19:29;"And then he kinda brings it back up."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"And then people go nuts,"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"but great vibe at the Bruno Mars show."

01:20:46;01:20:51;"- It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"- This week for the Top Five,"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"we're comparing the greatest hits of 1980"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"with the current Top Five of 2022."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Why 1980?"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"Well, that's obvious."
01:21:04;01:21:09;"It's the year that ""Big League Chew"" hit stores,"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"setting in motion a sequence of events"
01:21:11;01:21:15;"that led to the film ""Tar"" in theaters now."
01:21:15;01:21:19;"A complicated, strange story of cinema and bubble gum."
01:21:19;01:21:20;"And I should point out"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"that we're comparing Billboard to Billboard."
01:21:22;01:21:25;"The Apple Music Top Five was all Taylor Swift,"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"which might've been fun."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"Maybe we'll do that next time,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"but we're going Billboard on Billboard."
01:21:31;01:21:34;"The number five song this week in 1980,"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"the Doobie Brothers' ""Real Love."""
01:21:41;01:21:48;"- Do you know this song, Jake?"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Is this like a major Doobie's song?"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"- I'm not recognizing it."
01:21:54;01:21:58;"- Kind of sounds like Bruno Mars to me."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"- It could be a little bit."
01:22:05;01:22:14;"- I wonder if this is the same record"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"as ""What a Fool Believes."""
01:22:15;01:22:17;"I mean, it's definitely the same."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"- Yeah, it's Michael McDonald era."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"- Same kind of groove too."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"- Yeah."
01:22:24;01:22:29;"So can somebody explain to me,"
01:22:29;01:22:32;"Michael McDonald was only in the Doobie Brothers"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"for a certain period of time?"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"- I don't know, man."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Yeah, 'cause it's like the 70s Doobie Brothers-"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"- Oh yeah, this sounds just like ""What a Fool Believes."""
01:22:40;01:22:41;"- Listen to the music and stuff,"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"and like, ""Oh, Blackwater."""
01:22:44;01:22:45;"It's a totally different band."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"- They used to be like a rootsy-"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"- Yeah."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- Southern rock band."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"- Yeah, mid-70s, you know."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"- He was in the band from '75 to '82,"
01:22:56;01:23:00;"then '87, then again in 2019 until now."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"I mean, it's classic with a lot of these bands,"
01:23:02;01:23:05;"like, you know, think about like Genesis,"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"like what they were doing in the mid-70s"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"as opposed to like the mid-80s."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"- It's funny because-"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"- You know, or Journey or something."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Yeah."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- With the decline of bands"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"being less of like a cultural force,"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"you have less opportunity for that"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"because back in the day, like today,"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"today if like the singer of a band left the band,"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"probably they'd just start a new band."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"- Yeah."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"- 'Cause they'd probably be like, ""Who gives a (beep)?"""
01:23:30;01:23:31;"Like, ""All right, we did our thing with this band,"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"""we'll do a new band."""
01:23:32;01:23:36;"But back in the day, these bands were so massive"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"that the idea that you just like end the band,"
01:23:38;01:23:41;"end Genesis, it's like, ""No, let's like do it."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"""Let's take it to a new era."""
01:23:44;01:23:46;"So yeah, Genesis, Doobie Brothers."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"- Chicago's another example."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"- Chicago, yeah, famously."
01:23:50;01:23:50;"And it's funny because-"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"- You're a singer, yeah."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"- I don't know that much about these bands,"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"but like a buddy of mine was talking to me"
01:23:56;01:24:01;"about this new wave, like the past four, three, four years,"
01:24:01;01:24:04;"been all these like new British bands,"
01:24:04;01:24:09;"Black Mitty, Black Country, New Roads, anyway, Jockstrap."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"He was just like kind of filling me in on all these bands."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"- Jockstrap."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"- Jockstrap album's good."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"There's some good stuff on it."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"So I was like checking out these bands."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"I'd heard about them and I know people like them,"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"but so I was reading about this band,"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Black Country, New Road,"
01:24:22;01:24:26;"and it's like eight or nine people in the band."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"And I was just kind of getting in and checking it out,"
01:24:29;01:24:33;"listening to their new album, it's critically acclaimed."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"I watched a great performance they did."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"And then I read, ""Oh, the singer just left the band."""
01:24:37;01:24:41;"And you know, he's, this guy had like a lot of personality"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"in his vocals and maybe he was the lyricist,"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"but they said they're going to keep going."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"So I was like kind of interested to see that"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"'cause that seemed like a real seventies move."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"- I love it."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"I bet they're probably going to share vocal duties"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"with whosoever's in the band."
01:24:54;01:24:58;"Maybe a Phil Collins will emerge,"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"but I also love the idea."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"They just get like a Michael McDonald type dude,"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"just totally changes the sound of the band."
01:25:03;01:25:08;"- It's like if Father John Missy never left the Fleet Foxes"
01:25:08;01:25:11;"and then like he became like the principal songwriter"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"in that band at this point."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"- That would be amazing."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"- It would be like that kind of thing."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"It's still the Fleet Foxes."

01:25:40;01:25:41;"- Yeah."
01:25:41;01:25:44;"- November 4th, Los Angeles, Mountain Brews,"
01:25:44;01:25:49;"vinyl record release show at Permanent Records Roadhouse."
01:25:49;01:25:49;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- Getting the word out."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"I forgot to plug it last time"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"and plugging it now while I'm thinking of it."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Boom."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"- Live brews."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"- Live brews, seven piece."
01:26:00;01:26:02;"We'll have the record there to buy."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"We'll have t-shirts, we'll have beer koozies,"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"coasters, coffee mugs."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"We're going all in."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"- I love it."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"And anybody who hasn't seen it,"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"the Mountain Brews vinyl looks amazing."
01:26:12;01:26:16;"And also the Mountain Brews vinyl is your complete works."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"- Yeah, it's a double album."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"It's all four EPs."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- Love that."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"- And where are we at with the Mountain Brews brews?"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Have those been?"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"- Those are in route."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"I was just emailing with them the other day."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"We might have them there that night."
01:26:29;01:26:32;"I need to interface with Permanent Records"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"and see if they'd let us sell them."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Maybe they might not, but whatever."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"- Vinyl and beer."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"- The brews are leaving Dave Grohl alley"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"in Ohio as we speak."
01:26:43;01:26:46;"I think they're in route, so."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"- And coming to California."
01:26:48;01:26:51;"And it's a little bit, it's still down the pipeline,"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"but the next baseball season,"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"there's some talks that we're gonna be seeing"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"some Mountain Chews."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"And that's a collaboration between Mountain Brews"
01:26:59;01:27:00;"and Big League Chew."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"- Mountain Chews."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"- It's margarita flavored."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"- Yikes."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"- That's actually pretty good."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"(laughing)"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"The worst margarita flavored Big League Chew Mountain Chews."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"- That's really good."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"All right, November 4th, come out."
01:27:18;01:27:19;"- That would be so '70s."
01:27:19;01:27:23;"You got your first few Fleet Foxes records,"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"got a certain tone."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"And then somebody's just like,"
01:27:26;01:27:30;"yeah, you know, the middle period Foxes records,"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"there's some similarities,"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"but just like, they're so much more satirical, lyrically."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"And you're like, you know that's not the same singer, right?"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Oh, really?"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"No, it's like totally different songwriter."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"That makes sense."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"Okay, they're kind of similar, it's different."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"But I love the idea of just like,"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"if a band like Black Country New Road,"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"who's kind of got these like long songs,"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"like kind of post-rock, very indie,"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"kind of like emotional lyrics and stuff,"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"and like tempo changes and stuff."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"If you're just like, if they got into like Chicago phase,"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"I can't think of the best example."
01:28:02;01:28:03;"It would never happen, but it would almost be like-"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"- Yeah, just like huge power ballads, yeah."
01:28:05;01:28:08;"- Bruno Mars became the singer for a few years."
01:28:08;01:28:11;"That record sold 9 million copies."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"And then they kind of went back to the indie thing,"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"and it was, you know, the people liked it,"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"but it just never hit a real moment."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"- No, it's like the bass player that didn't sing at all"
01:28:21;01:28:25;"in the first two records actually has like an angelic voice."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- Right."
01:28:26;01:28:30;"- And is like incredible, you know, balladeer,"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"and wrote some huge hits for them,"
01:28:32;01:28:35;"and then left and went on a solo career."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"- Right, so there's, yeah, there'd be two records"
01:28:38;01:28:42;"that were just like diamond status,"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"just full of like power ballads,"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"three and a half minute songs."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"Then that dude goes on to have a successful career."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"And then maybe like the old guy, the old singer returns,"
01:28:51;01:28:54;"and they go back to eight minute,"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"prog indie jams."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"The number five song, Post Malone, ""I Like You"","
01:28:59;01:29:01;"a Happier song featuring Doja Cat."
