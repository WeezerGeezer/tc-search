00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis, back again. It's time to go back to school as we enter September."
00:10;00:22;"In this episode, we'll talk about DJ Khaled, Bob Dylan, the Pentagon, and of course, Starbucks."
00:22;00:31;"This is a Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
11:46;11:48;"This is like some real practice room vibes."
11:48;11:50;"Yeah."
11:50;11:54;"I don't think I would have recognized the song if I didn't know."
11:54;11:58;"It was Man and Me."
11:58;12:00;"I can kind of hear it on the verse."
12:00;12:02;"Yeah."
12:14;12:16;"Interesting."
12:16;12:20;"A reggae Man and Me, 1979."
12:20;12:28;"And also it's worth pointing out that for, you know, people of our generation, the Gen Xers, the Silverback Millennials,"
12:28;12:40;"of course Man and Me is like a top five Dylan song, but a huge part of that is because of The Big Lebowski and it being prominently featured on the soundtrack."
12:40;12:45;"My understanding is that before The Big Lebowski, like of course Dylan heads knew the song and loved it."
12:45;12:49;"It was like a well-regarded song, but you know, that wasn't like primetime Dylan."
12:49;12:56;"Definitely my introduction to the song at age 21, I had not, like yeah, I was 21 when that movie came out."
12:56;12:59;"I saw it, you know, as soon as it came out."
12:59;13:05;"I remember being like, I remember having a pretty visceral memory of like, whoa, what is this Dylan?"
13:05;13:07;"It's obviously Dylan, right?"
13:07;13:08;"Right."
13:08;13:12;"I don't think when I was 21 I'd even like really dipped into any of the 70s stuff."
13:12;13:16;"I really only knew like Highway 61 and the early stuff."
13:16;13:23;"Yeah, maybe you might've known a bit of Desire, Blood on the Tracks, but not the early 70s."
13:23;13:26;"Yeah, and I was definitely like, this is amazing."
13:26;13:31;"It's interesting to picture Joe Strummer like being like, I want to do that song."
13:31;13:38;"Like, you know, for instance, if you told me there was them jamming on like a reggae version of a Knocking on Heaven's Door."
13:38;13:40;"I'd be like, all right, yeah."
13:40;13:41;"Sure."
13:41;13:42;"Knocking on Heaven's Door is like a standard."
13:42;13:43;"Masters of War."
13:43;13:44;"Okay, yeah, sure."
13:44;13:45;"Reggae versions."
13:45;13:46;"Right, yeah."
13:46;13:47;"Blown in the wind."
13:47;13:56;"Blown in the wind, but for them to pick Man and Me, even to jam on, that implies some fairly serious Dylan fandom, I think."
13:56;13:59;"So smash cut to Infidels '83."
13:59;14:02;"Strummer's there at the record store day one buying that."
14:02;14:03;"Oh, yeah."
14:03;14:04;"Throwing that on."
14:04;14:05;"Throws on Joe."
14:05;14:06;"I could totally picture that."
14:06;14:09;"He gets home for track one Joker, man."
14:09;14:11;"He's like, oh, sh*t."
14:11;14:13;"All right, Bob, you're on the same wavelength."
14:13;14:14;"Old guy still got it."
14:14;14:15;"Still got it."
14:15;14:23;"Alakazam told the boogeyman, you have to let that rugger drop."
14:23;14:30;"The oil down the desert way had been shaken to the top."
14:30;14:33;"The shaky drove his Cadillac."
14:33;14:38;"He went cruising down the hill."
14:38;14:45;"The prison was a standing on the radiator grill."
14:45;14:49;"Shari, don't back it."
14:49;14:53;"Rock the casbah, rock the casbah."
14:53;14:57;"Shari, don't back it."
14:57;15:00;"Rock the casbah, rock the casbah."
15:00;15:02;"I'm in Japan right now."
15:02;15:04;"You might notice that it's not the best audio."
15:04;15:06;"Hopefully it's a little better than FaceTime."
15:06;15:08;"I don't have all my gear with me."
15:08;15:11;"I'm going to get it together, but just at this moment."
15:11;15:14;"Sometimes you think those banked ups are going to last forever."
15:14;15:17;"Next thing you know, you're doing back to school shopping."
15:17;15:20;"I thought we were good to go till at least late September,"
15:20;15:22;"and then it just crept up on me."
15:22;15:24;"I was like, f*ck, damn it."
15:24;15:26;"We're out of banked."
15:26;15:27;"Yep."
15:27;15:28;"Summer's over."
15:28;15:30;"The banked ups have all gone home."
15:30;15:32;"Back to school."
15:32;15:33;"Back to life."
15:33;15:34;"Back to reality."
15:34;15:35;"Back to that TC grind."
15:35;15:37;"I gotta tell you, I was depressed, guys."
15:37;15:38;"I could feel it."
15:38;15:42;"I feel like I was getting to the tail end of not hanging out with you."
15:42;15:44;"That's how I knew."
15:44;15:46;"This is how we hang out."
15:46;15:47;"You know what I mean?"
15:47;15:50;"There was a time where I was like, oh yeah, I'm getting calls from people saying,"
15:50;15:52;"oh, I love more Dylan."
15:52;15:54;"Really? You're getting calls?"
15:54;15:56;"I am getting a few calls."
15:56;15:57;"Who called?"
15:57;15:59;"On the rotary phone."
15:59;16:00;"On my landline."
16:00;16:02;"I got a fax."
16:02;16:06;"I was like, Nick Weidenfeld, please hold for Mr."
16:06;16:10;"Amanda picks up and she says, oh, Nick, phone's for you."
16:10;16:13;"Just get it, says, love the Dylan, and then hang up."
16:13;16:19;"No, I've told you, I have a couple friends."
16:19;16:21;"Nick, this is President Joe Biden."
16:21;16:23;"Just wanted to say."
16:23;16:28;"All those potential spam calls are just fans of the show."
16:28;16:35;"No, Emily, my friend Emily and Vernon, who, you know, I've talked to you guys about Vernon."
16:35;16:36;"Oh, yeah."
16:36;16:41;"Vernon Chapman, comedy legend, does South Park and wonder shows."
16:41;16:42;"And he called up."
16:42;16:46;"He said, I dipped into volume three because of the show."
16:46;16:50;"And I was like, oh, well, that's great, because I really did think we were going to lose people."
16:50;16:56;"Well, I think, as with anything with a point of view, it's like the people who love it are going to love it."
16:56;16:58;"Really appreciate it."
16:58;17:00;"I got some nice emails from people, too."
17:00;17:03;"But yeah, anyway, back to life, back to reality."
17:03;17:06;"Can't live in the Bob Dylan volume three forever."
17:06;17:08;"Maybe we should return to it every summer."
17:08;17:10;"Next summer, we'll just go deeper and deeper."
17:10;17:12;"Next summer, we'll do four parts."
17:12;17:13;"We'll record it in late June."
17:13;17:15;"Say, see you in September, guys."
17:15;17:21;"Enjoy an excruciatingly detailed four-part take on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits volume three."
17:21;17:31;"Someone on Twitter had the idea of us compiling our own version of Greatest Hits volume four from 1993 onward or whatever it was."
17:31;17:33;"91 onward."
17:33;17:43;"Yeah, now, of course, we'll be flying semi-blind because a huge component of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits technique is to use unreleased songs."
17:43;17:44;"That is true."
17:44;17:46;"So we'll be flying a bit blind, but we can try."
17:46;17:48;"I have been going deeper on those albums, too."
17:48;17:51;"I mean, it's so funny with Dylan."
17:51;18:07;"You know all the classic, classic stuff, and then you realize there's a whole world of Dylan fans who think that Mississippi off Love and Theft is perhaps his greatest
song or certainly a top three Dylan song."
18:07;18:08;"Damn."
18:08;18:09;"Do you know this song, Jake?"
18:09;18:10;"No."
18:10;18:15;"I'm woefully ignorant of everything, basically, from that era."
18:15;18:17;"So I'd really have my work cut out for me."
18:17;18:18;"All right."
18:18;18:21;"Let's move away from Dylan now because summer's over."
18:21;18:22;"Are you sure?"
18:22;18:23;"Yeah."
18:23;18:24;"Okay."
18:24;18:25;"We'll come back soon."
18:25;18:30;"Oh, the last thing I wanted to say about Dylan is I'm here in Japan, posted up for a little while."
18:30;18:34;"Rashida's doing a show out here, so we're doing our thing in Japan."
18:34;18:38;"Coincidentally, though, Vampire Weekend had a show in Japan, which was kind of nice."
18:38;18:43;"We did a very brief Asia tour, headlined Fuji Rock for the first time."
18:43;18:45;"I probably have mentioned this before."
18:45;18:46;"How'd it go?"
18:46;18:50;"We played a festival called Pentaport in Seoul."
18:50;18:52;"Or actually, no, it's in Incheon, Korea."
18:52;18:53;"We stayed in Seoul."
18:53;18:55;"It's in a city."
18:55;18:57;"It's where the airport, the big airport is."
18:57;19:02;"But last time we played Fuji Rock, we played it four times now, which is pretty crazy."
19:02;19:04;"Just been in the game a long time."
19:04;19:08;"Last time we played Fuji Rock, we played after Bob Dylan."
19:08;19:15;"Bob Dylan was, of course, the headliner, but we got an email like a month or two before the show where they were just like,"
19:15;19:19;"""Hey, Bob Dylan doesn't want to play that late. Can you swap slots with him?"""
19:19;19:20;"We're like, ""Sure."""
19:20;19:23;"So it doesn't mean Bob wasn't the headliner, but it meant we got to play after him."
19:23;19:25;"But this time, we were the official headliner."
19:25;19:30;"And, you know, Baio always makes the initial set list."
19:30;19:31;"He's really good at it."
19:31;19:33;"He always has great instincts."
19:33;19:37;"And then, you know, me and CT will go through it and have some suggestions."
19:37;19:40;"Or Maestona's feeling, ""Can we open with something different tonight?"""
19:40;19:41;"Or whatever."
19:41;19:44;"So we go through it together, but he always does these great first drafts."
19:44;19:48;"And he did a bunch of drafts for all the festivals we did this summer."
19:48;19:52;"And I saw Fuji Rock, and he put Joker Man Closer."
19:52;19:58;"I assume--I actually didn't ask him--I assume it was partially a nod to the fact that last time we were there, we played after Bob Dylan."
19:58;20:01;"Or he just felt like we hadn't busted out of Joker Man in a long time."
20:01;20:05;"But we closed Fuji Rock with our 10-minute Joker Man cover."
20:05;20:08;"Kind of a big swing, but I think it worked."
20:08;20:12;"We also had like--the PA was on the fritz for the first 15 minutes of that show."
20:12;20:19;"So we come out, like the great crowd, start playing, and we keep hearing these like ""k-k"" sounds."
20:19;20:21;"And eventually got so bad we had to go offstage."
20:21;20:23;"That was kind of a bummer."
20:23;20:30;"So then as we're onstage playing, you know, I'm still kind of getting over the stress of the PA being on the fritz."
20:30;20:33;"And I'm thinking like, ""Is this Joker Man Closer going to hit right?"""
20:33;20:34;"But it did."
20:34;20:37;"The crowd was down. Didn't lose anybody."
20:37;20:41;"And I think I already forgot, but I felt like it should have some context."
20:41;20:46;"So I learned how to say, ""This next one's a Bob Dylan song,"" in Japanese."
20:46;20:49;"I think it was really simple, right? Wait, Seinfeld, you know some Japanese, right?"
20:49;20:51;"Yeah, like, not that much."
20:51;20:54;"Like, if you said it to me, I wouldn't be able to verify whether it's correct."
20:54;20:58;"All he knows how to say is, ""This next song is Bob Dylan's."""
20:58;21:00;"Yeah, that's the only thing."
21:00;21:05;"I think it's, ""Uta no Bob Dylan desu."""
21:05;21:09;"Yeah, that sounds correct. Yeah, it does sound right. It has that feeling."
21:09;21:10;"It sounds right."
21:10;21:13;"I mean, I think you probably nailed it."
21:13;21:15;"How did you learn to say it?"
21:15;21:17;"I was just asking people backstage before the show."
21:17;21:21;"And also having been in Japan, you know, normally we're just there for like four or five days."
21:21;21:23;"And I've been posted up here a little bit longer."
21:23;21:26;"I felt a little more confident."
21:26;21:29;"You know, I've been taking some classes while I'm here."
21:29;21:36;"I barely know anything, but just to say a little bit more in Japanese, a little more confidently."
21:36;21:38;"I mean, of course, I always think about this."
21:38;21:45;"You go on stage in a foreign country, and people give you props in Korea just to say, ""Thank you,"" in Korean."
21:45;21:47;"You'll get a little bit of like, ""Okay!"""
21:47;21:51;"But it is just funny to imagine rolling up to a show in New York or LA,"
21:51;21:57;"and just imagine that the person on stage spoke a different language for 99% of their banter."
21:57;22:04;"You know, just like somebody in Korean or Spanish or something just got up and said, ""Thank you, Los Angeles."""
22:04;22:05;"And you're like, ""Woo!"""
22:05;22:07;"And then in a totally different language, they're like,"
22:07;22:09;"""Anyway, it's been a long time since we've been—"""
22:09;22:11;"You know, you're just like—"
22:11;22:15;"We're very lucky and privileged to speak English."
23:57;23:59;"Did you have to brush up on those Joker Man lyrics?"
23:59;24:01;"Because it's a long song."
24:01;24:04;"I realized that I have it pretty like—"
24:04;24:06;"It comes back to me quickly."
24:06;24:07;"Pretty dialed."
24:07;24:12;"And I really enjoy playing these long songs because I do feel like it gives me—"
24:12;24:14;"And sometimes I have the lyrics on stage if I want to back up."
24:14;24:20;"But it gives me a chance to like, delve back into them and like, think about them."
24:20;24:23;"You know, I'm always coming up with like, new theories on stage,"
24:23;24:26;"thinking about, you know, really, who is the Joker Man?"
24:26;24:29;"And yeah, but I know it pretty well."
24:29;24:35;"I feel like someone sent to the thread that Vampire Weekend was approaching Built to Spill"
24:35;24:39;"for the record of times that they've played Joker Man live."
24:39;24:41;"Yes. That was me."
24:41;24:43;"I feel like you're— You sent it to the thread."
24:43;24:46;"Are you basically neck and neck with BTS?"
24:46;24:51;"Yeah, we're neck and neck because one feature I love of setlist.fm,"
24:51;24:59;"the setlist website, is that you can pick a song and see numbers of how many times it's been played by everybody."
24:59;25:04;"So, for instance, you click on the song Joker Man, you're going to see number one, by a wide margin,"
25:04;25:07;"is, as you might expect, Bob Dylan."
25:07;25:10;"He's played Joker Man a hundred-something times."
25:10;25:15;"Number two is Built to Spill, who I believe has played Joker Man 19 times."
25:15;25:16;"18."
25:16;25:18;"18. And number three is Vampire Weekend with how many?"
25:18;25:20;"15. But does that count Fuji Rock?"
25:20;25:22;"It probably— Yeah, it must."
25:22;25:23;"Yeah? Okay."
25:23;25:27;"If we play Joker Man three more times and Built to Spill does not,"
25:27;25:30;"and hopefully they're not keeping in their sets lately,"
25:30;25:35;"we will get the coveted number two slot of all time for Joker Man."
25:35;25:38;"Oh, yeah. Look, most recently played, 29th, Vampire Weekend."
25:38;25:39;"Yeah, they're up to date."
25:39;25:42;"So we're the most— As far as setlist.fm is concerned,"
25:42;25:48;"the last time Joker Man was performed live in the whole world was Vampire Weekend at Fuji Rock."
25:48;25:50;"That's something to hang your hat on."
25:50;25:51;"That's a good feeling."
25:51;25:52;"Hey, let me ask you something."
25:52;25:54;"I don't see Bob busting it out anytime soon."
25:54;26:00;"Oh, and Matt just pointed out Built to Spill played it last in May 2015."
26:00;26:02;"So they may have given up."
26:02;26:03;"Out of rotation."
26:03;26:06;"I mean, I suggested that Mountain Brews start playing it."
26:06;26:07;"Did you?"
26:07;26:11;"Yeah, and take that slot from Vampire Weekend."
26:11;26:15;"Uh, I don't— You know, that's an interesting idea."
26:15;26:19;"I don't think I have the time to commit those lyrics to memory."
26:19;26:21;"It'll take a while."
26:21;26:24;"I don't want to step on a friend's turf."
26:24;26:25;"Thank you."
26:25;26:31;"I'm going to respect the VW and BTS Joker Man legacy."
26:31;26:32;"Hey, look at this."
26:32;26:33;"And Bob Dylan."
26:33;26:35;"Oh, yeah, and Bob, sure."
26:35;26:39;"Bob Dylan hasn't played it live since 2003."
26:39;26:43;"So you could, like, I mean, you could probably get there."
26:43;26:44;"Keep at it."
26:44;26:48;"And I will say, you know, and I think this is the reason that Baeho puts it in setlist."
26:48;26:54;"We closed out a cool festival in the Netherlands in 2019 with Joker Man."
26:54;26:55;"Another big swing."
26:55;27:00;"And it was kind of cool because, you know, we have like this like kind of cool like kraut rock part in the middle."
27:00;27:04;"I will say of all like the covers, it's one that just like feels good."
27:04;27:08;"I think, you know, maybe because it's like a reggae groove, it feels familiar."
27:08;27:10;"You get to know it."
27:10;27:15;"Even if you don't know the song by the end, you're like pretty psyched on it."
27:15;27:21;"It does feel like one that will be in our here and there in our setlist for a long time to come."
27:21;27:32;"Can I ask is setlist.f like how rigorous like if you did two, three, four Joker Man back to back at one show just to beat that record in one shot?"
27:32;27:37;"Are they counting that as one Joker Man or is that are they going to count each Joker Man?"
27:37;27:39;"I think they would count each Joker Man."
27:39;27:41;"But, you know, it's a community based thing."
27:41;27:48;"So, you know, you got to hope that the fans are correctly taking down the setlist."
27:48;27:51;"I've rarely seen mistakes, so I trust it."
27:51;27:56;"But, you know, right or wrong, it's the website of record for these types of issues."
27:56;27:58;"Would you would you consider it?"
27:58;27:59;"Yeah, sure."
27:59;28:03;"We do like a surprise show somewhere, maybe like a lead up to the next album."
28:03;28:07;"Everybody's expecting that they're going to like hear some new songs or something."
28:07;28:10;"Do it an underplay at a small club."
28:10;28:11;"Gold diggers."
28:11;28:12;"Hey, guys, thanks for coming."
28:12;28:15;"You know, our next album is coming out in a few months."
28:15;28:30;"And, you know, so we want to have some real big fans with us just to kind of kick off that whole thing and to help us make sure that we have played Joker Man more than anybody
in the world, excepting, of course, Mr. Bob Dylan."
28:30;28:35;"So anyway, you know, with your permission, we're going to play it about 10 times right now."
28:35;28:38;"And yeah, that's it."
28:38;28:40;"So buckle up."
28:40;28:46;"We could play it three times, but we really want to secure the title."
28:46;28:47;"Yeah."
28:47;28:53;"Once you know, once Doug and the boys get word of this, Doug's like, it's on full."
28:53;28:58;"And Bill's the Joker Man War starts playing it one to two times every night."
28:58;29:02;"Two bands that just play Joker Man on their entire tour."
29:02;29:08;"And if there's anybody listening, don't mention this to the BTS built a spill team."
29:08;29:09;"Just don't get them fired up about it."
29:09;29:10;"OK."
29:10;29:20;"Stand on the water, casting your breath while the eyes of the eye with the iron head."
29:20;29:23;"It's the six element of a miss."
29:23;29:26;"You were born with a statement, both of this."
29:26;29:30;"Hercules."
29:30;29:36;"Freedom just around the corner."
29:36;29:55;"The truth so far."
29:55;30:00;"So I hear it's a pumpkin spice latte season again."
30:00;30:09;"This drives me up a wall when they chain retail establishments bust out the sort of like a tunnel fall vibes when it's still August."
30:09;30:10;"It's insane."
30:10;30:14;"I saw a Halloween Superstore open the other day."
30:14;30:16;"Oh, CBS is full Halloween mode."
30:16;30:19;"It's just like, guys, come on."
30:19;30:22;"After Labor Day, at least even after Labor Day."
30:22;30:24;"I mean, I think at least when does summer end?"
30:24;30:25;"What's the last day of summer?"
30:25;30:28;"Like mid-September, September 22nd, I think."
30:28;30:30;"Oh, my God."
30:30;30:33;"Let the light start to shift a little bit."
30:33;30:38;"Let the leaves start to kind of go into their fallow mode just an eency bit."
30:38;30:39;"Right."
30:39;30:44;"And also, it's like many places in the world, fall is getting shorter and shorter."
30:44;30:46;"Summer is getting longer and longer."
30:46;30:57;"So not only does the actual fall sometimes not feel like fall, by making the false fall earlier and earlier in the year,"
30:57;31:07;"you're entering this period of like six weeks of total cognitive dissonance of just boiling hot summer and then fall vibes."
31:07;31:08;"And it's just pathetic."
31:08;31:09;"It's sad."
31:09;31:13;"It's like getting like a piping hot pumpkin spice latte at like three in the afternoon."
31:13;31:16;"And it's like 101 degrees in the parking lot."
31:16;31:21;"Just like the heat waves, just like the mirage waves coming off the hood of your car."
31:21;31:23;"False fall, dude."
31:23;31:25;"I mean, LA is particularly false fall."
31:25;31:27;"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a false fall."
31:27;31:29;"Fall Alex Jones."
31:29;31:33;"2022, you got a false fall attack."
31:33;31:34;"You know, it's funny."
31:34;31:45;"The other day I was thinking like about I've never actually read it, but you know that old book that's about climate change, environmentalism by Rachel Carson called
Silent Spring."
31:45;31:47;"From like the 60s, I think."
31:47;31:48;"Yeah, from the 60s, I believe."
31:48;31:49;"Yeah."
31:49;31:52;"And, you know, she was sounding the alarm all the way back then."
31:52;31:54;"But I don't think it was about climate change."
31:54;31:56;"It was about like pesticides."
31:56;31:57;"Yeah, pesticides."
31:57;31:58;"Oh, pesticides."
31:58;31:59;"All right."
31:59;32:02;"An early environmentalist book in the modern era."
32:02;32:05;"I was just thinking about how dope that title is, Silent Spring."
32:05;32:08;"And I was thinking like you could never call an album Silent Spring, though."
32:08;32:10;"It's just like too."
32:10;32:11;"The title is a little bit too famous."
32:11;32:13;"Like, yeah, it's a dope title."
32:13;32:16;"Like that's why people still talk about that book, Silent Spring."
32:16;32:20;"It just wouldn't be that cool if like Manpower Weekend had an album called Silent Spring."
32:20;32:26;"As much as it's a resonant title, I feel like some of our listeners will be like, ""Eh, really? Just named it that after the book?"""
32:26;32:28;"I think False Fall is it."
32:28;32:32;"So then I just realized like, yeah, because Silent Spring is like serious."
32:32;32:34;"It doesn't have like even a touch of humor."
32:34;32:38;"It's not digging deep like Father of the Bride, you know, really just going deep into culture."
32:38;32:40;"It's, you know, Silent Spring."
32:40;32:42;"Anyway, yeah, False Fall."
32:42;32:44;"Now that's something that could be ours."
32:44;32:50;"Also, it's kind of like sounds a little bit like a hardcore EP from the 80s."
32:50;32:52;"""False Fall!"""
32:52;32:56;"Earth Crisis is putting out their new EP, False Fall."
32:56;32:57;"False Fall."
32:57;33:00;"Our new album, False Fall, in stores now."
33:00;33:02;"Track one, Pumpkin Spice Latte."
33:02;33:04;"Iced."
33:05;33:19;"It's just like 27, 45-second songs, incredibly angry, all about this feeling of these corporate marketing people making us celebrate fall starting in late August."
33:23;33:25;"Taking it all back!"
33:25;33:31;"The youth and most depoised have turned the day counterattack!"
33:31;33:34;"Violence against violence!"
33:34;33:35;"Blame the roundups!"
33:35;33:42;"Bringing a firestorm to purify the pain that society dwells in!"
33:42;33:44;"No mercy!"
33:44;33:45;"No exceptions!"
33:45;33:48;"A declaration of total war!"
33:48;33:51;"The innocent's defense!"
33:51;33:54;"The reason is we fall!"
33:54;33:57;"So, Seinfeld, you did some interesting digging."
33:57;34:05;"You found an interview or some article with the man who's considered the godfather of the pumpkin spice latte?"
34:05;34:10;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just sharing out an article I found on CBS News."
34:10;34:14;"I don't... Oh, yeah. What's his name? Dukes. Peter Dukes."
34:14;34:22;"He's currently the director of global growth and concepts, but he was the creator of the pumpkin spice latte."
34:22;34:29;"And, yeah, there's kind of like this picture of him, like, holding a pumpkin and looking a little bit diabolical."
34:29;34:33;"But, yeah, that article was filled with great, great quotes."
34:33;34:36;"But, I mean, it was interesting."
34:36;34:42;"He talks about the formation of the latte. And what did he say?"
34:42;34:48;"He says that he had knocked it out of the park with the Christmas beverage slate."
34:48;34:58;"And a lot of the younger folks listening right now, they just take it for granted that you can go into most coffee shops in America around Christmas time."
34:58;35:05;"You can get some kind of peppermint latte or a gingerbread cappuccino or these types of things."
35:05;35:12;"But, you know, back in the day, you go to a coffee place, you probably get just some type of regular degular coffee."
35:12;35:17;"And, yes, it would be Christmas time. Maybe you go to a bakery nearby and get a gingerbread cookie and you could eat it together."
35:17;35:25;"But the idea of combining those things, as much as that just seems like a fundamental human right and a basic staple of the American diet,"
35:25;35:31;"until the late 90s, this was not as obvious as it seems."
35:31;35:34;"And this was also part of Starbucks' takeover."
35:34;35:37;"You know, the 90s had this explosive growth."
35:37;35:41;"And then in the late 90s, they started introducing these seasonal beverages in wintertime."
35:41;35:45;"One more reason to go to Starbucks."
35:45;35:47;"And I guess that's a classic American move."
35:47;35:52;"When a company gets big enough, eventually they have to at least try to own Christmas."
35:52;36:00;"In fact, I did have an experience recently in Japan driving past one of the classic Japanese vending machines."
36:00;36:04;"They always have different types of branding beverage vending machines that are on every corner."
36:04;36:10;"And this one had some Coca-Cola branding and it was a polar bear holding the Coke."
36:10;36:12;"I don't know why in the middle of the summer they had that."
36:12;36:15;"Maybe it's just year-round."
36:15;36:23;"And my son, who's coming into his own, asking lots of questions, said, ""Daddy, what is that polar bear holding?"""
36:23;36:26;"And I realized I had a lot of explaining to do."
36:26;36:28;"And I said, ""Well, he's holding a Coca-Cola."""
36:28;36:30;"And he didn't really know what Coca-Cola was."
36:30;36:31;"I said, ""It's like a soda."""
36:31;36:33;"He said, ""Why?"""
36:33;36:36;"And then I realized, you know, it's not easy to explain."
36:36;36:38;"And I said, ""Well, you know, it's a soda."""
36:38;36:42;"And then at this time, they do these ads where the polar bear holds it."
36:42;36:48;"And he said, ""You know, I'm just trying to explain this kind of insane, multilayered concept."""
36:48;37:00;"And I said, ""But son, if you're really interested in these types of discussions, I'd love to put you onto an internet radio show that I've been a part of for about five
years."""
37:00;37:05;"I think if you start around episode 33, it really comes into its own."
37:05;37:09;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
37:09;37:13;"Music so hot, it'll melt your face off."
37:13;37:15;"Yeah, but it is funny."
37:15;37:18;"You just see this polar bear and you take it for as a given."
37:18;37:20;"Like, ""Oh, yeah, Coca-Cola with their polar bears."""
37:20;37:23;"And you realize that was—somebody made that decision."
37:23;37:26;"They were like, ""Coca-Cola is one of the biggest brands in America."
37:26;37:29;"We have to have a foothold in Christmas."
37:29;37:32;"You're not a real American brand if you don't have a Christmas tradition."""
37:32;37:38;"I mean, and Coca-Cola is especially insane because many parts of the country are cold at Christmas."
37:38;37:43;"Like, why would you be taking down an ice-cold glass bottle of Coke then?"
37:43;37:44;"It doesn't make any sense."
37:44;37:48;"At least with Starbucks, it's cozy to go get a warm beverage."
37:48;37:58;"But anyway, I would make the case that in the late '90s, Starbucks was really coming into its own and truly becoming an iconic American brand a la Coca-Cola."
37:58;38:00;"And part of that was owning Christmas."
38:00;38:06;"Now, Starbucks is not just a place where you go slam a coffee in the morning before work."
38:06;38:13;"It's a place that you might even make a little trip with your family to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
38:13;38:15;"You know, that's next level."
38:15;38:16;"It's a lifestyle brand."
38:16;38:18;"It becomes a lifestyle brand at that point."
38:18;38:24;"So anyway, this guy knocked it out of the park with—I mean, what were the initial Christmas beverages?"
38:24;38:26;"Is it actually a peppermint latte?"
38:26;38:29;"Peppermint mocha was the big one."
38:29;38:35;"So peppermint mocha takes off, and then they're like, ""Well, let's move into the fall now. Let's own the fall."""
38:35;38:38;"And Duke says he came up with a hundred different ideas."
38:38;38:42;"They were looking into chocolate, caramel, you know, cinnamon stuff."
38:42;38:45;"And then this idea of pumpkin spice comes about."
38:45;38:47;"And this is such an interesting quote."
38:47;38:53;"""We brought in pumpkin pies into our R&D lab and actually just poured shots of espresso on them and ate them."""
38:53;38:55;"[laughter]"
38:55;38:56;"You can imagine."
38:56;38:58;"Wait, back up. Back up."
38:58;39:00;"Out of control."
39:00;39:02;"This guy is truly a wild man."
39:02;39:08;"The way he describes it, too, is just like—especially because I imagine he's not like a food scientist, right?"
39:08;39:09;"He's a marketing guy."
39:09;39:10;"Yeah, he looks like a—"
39:10;39:19;"So whatever they actually come up with, they eventually have to send down to the boys in the lab to actually cook up, like, you know, whatever."
39:19;39:20;"Could you imagine?"
39:20;39:21;"Specific."
39:21;39:28;"You go to Starbucks and you order the pumpkin spice latte and they just poured a shot of espresso on a pumpkin pie?"
39:28;39:29;"On a piece of pumpkin pie."
39:29;39:30;"And just gave it to you?"
39:30;39:31;"I mean, it kind of—"
39:31;39:32;"That's kind of nice."
39:32;39:34;"Sort of like an affogato."
39:34;39:39;"But I'm just also, like, picturing this guy being in, like—not even in, like, some industrial kitchen."
39:39;39:41;"You know, he's like an office guy."
39:41;39:45;"He's probably got his corner office, and he's like, ""Everybody, go to my office."""
39:45;39:48;"And he's just like, ""All right, bust out these pumpkin pies."
39:48;39:52;"Everybody grab a slice, dump an espresso shot on it, and eat it."""
39:52;39:53;"What did they learn from that?"
39:53;39:55;"Yeah, and by the way—"
39:55;39:56;"This thing has legs."
39:56;39:57;"Right, yeah."
39:57;40:01;"And just to be clear, at the time, he was actually in charge of espresso."
40:01;40:03;"Like, that was his beat."
40:03;40:08;"Yeah, he—the holiday menu wasn't his responsibility."
40:08;40:11;"He was just looking after espresso."
40:11;40:17;"So this was a real moment of inspiration, I think, where he had his thing that he owned,"
40:17;40:21;"and he said, ""Well, let me just throw my product on the pumpkin pie."""
40:21;40:22;"Oh, okay."
40:22;40:28;"So he didn't invent the peppermint mocha himself, but the company had had success with it."
40:28;40:32;"So here's a guy, an ambitious guy in corporate America."
40:32;40:38;"He made it to head of espresso, but, you know, that's not going to get you into the country club."
40:38;40:47;"But I bet there was an executive in the holiday eventizing or, you know, seasonal beverages department who was furious."
40:47;40:49;"Oh, because he, like, stepped on his toes?"
40:49;40:50;"Absolutely."
40:50;40:51;"Okay."
40:51;40:53;"That kind of overreaching in the executive space."
40:53;40:57;"Maybe we finally have our time crisis neo-Mad Men take."
40:57;41:00;"This takes place at Starbucks in the late '90s."
41:00;41:02;"It's like—I can't even remember the character."
41:02;41:04;"What's the guy that Don J. wrote?"
41:04;41:05;"Like, the young guy, Pete?"
41:05;41:06;"Pete."
41:06;41:07;"Oh, yeah."
41:07;41:08;"Campbell."
41:08;41:13;"Yeah, you have a Don Draper-type guy who's been, like, running the holiday marketing for years."
41:13;41:18;"And then you got this ambitious young guy, head of espresso, who's just coming in, throwing all these crazy ideas."
41:18;41:23;"The older guy's, like, walking past his office and, like, doubles back, like, peers in."
41:23;41:27;"""Are these f***ing weirdos just dumping espresso on pumpkin pie?"
41:27;41:29;"These guys are f***ing insane."""
41:29;41:33;"But then it gets, like, really nasty, and that guy eventually takes his job and so on and so on."
41:33;41:37;"At the very least, it could be an Academy Award-winning film."
41:37;41:39;"At the very least."
41:39;41:41;"So he's dumping—"
41:41;41:46;"At the very least, it'll win Best Picture at the Oscars."
41:46;41:50;"Adam Driver stars in Head of Espresso."
41:50;41:55;"Like, a fast-paced ensemble, like an Adam McKay, a little bit big short."
41:55;41:56;"Yep."
41:56;41:57;"Okay."
41:57;41:58;"Espresso Man."
41:58;42:01;"No, it's the guy that made Moneyball."
42:01;42:05;"Very classy, kind of taut moviemaking."
42:05;42:07;"Oh, yeah. What's that guy's name? Bennett Miller."
42:07;42:08;"Nice. Good pull."
42:08;42:10;"Yeah. I think this could be really good."

43:27;43:30;"- So instead of espresso, he starts experimenting."
43:30;43:32;"Yeah, so maybe that explains why he was experimenting"
43:32;43:35;"in such a kind of like rough handed way."
43:35;43:36;"Also, there's something,"
43:36;43:38;"I don't wanna criticize them too much"
43:38;43:42;"because as anybody involved in the creative process knows,"
43:42;43:46;"sometimes you are blind to the most obvious ideas."
43:46;43:47;"And in retrospect, you think,"
43:47;43:49;"how did we not try that drum beat?"
43:49;43:53;"It's such a classic, simple drum beat."
43:53;43:54;"We didn't even try it for months."
43:54;43:55;"We were, you know, we're thinking about"
43:55;43:57;"all these other crazy things."
43:57;43:59;"And so, you know, sometimes you can be blind"
43:59;44:00;"to a solution that's right under your nose,"
44:00;44:05;"but also this idea that they hadn't already tried pumpkin."
44:05;44:09;"The way he frames it is as if I tried hundreds of things,"
44:09;44:11;"all sorts of bizarre combinations"
44:11;44:15;"to try to connote fall for the American consumer."
44:15;44:17;"And then finally I was so exasperated,"
44:17;44:19;"I just bought a (beep) pumpkin pie"
44:19;44:20;"and dumped espresso on it."
44:20;44:22;"And I said, this is it."
44:22;44:24;"As if like that wouldn't be the first thing"
44:24;44:25;"that like the lab would say,"
44:25;44:28;"all right, traditionally for fall people,"
44:28;44:30;"there's like three things that people might do."
44:30;44:31;"One of them is pumpkin."
44:31;44:35;"Here's an artificial pumpkin, you know, syrup we created."
44:35;44:35;"What do you think?"
44:35;44:38;"- Pile of leaves latte."
44:38;44:39;"(laughing)"
44:39;44:40;"- I mean, what else is there?"
44:40;44:41;"- Apple cider."
44:41;44:42;"- Apple cider."
44:42;44:43;"- Apple cider latte."
44:43;44:45;"- Yeah, I mean, it's hard to really believe this."
44:45;44:48;"I think it probably was like the guys in the lab were like,"
44:48;44:51;"here's a pumpkin syrup we can squirt into the espresso."
44:51;44:54;"And that was it."
44:54;44:56;"- I like the romantic."
44:56;44:58;"I like the Jackson Pollock, you know,"
44:58;44:59;"he's just like sweating it out."
44:59;45:00;"- I don't buy it."
45:00;45:02;"- He's throwing."
45:02;45:04;"- He's so exasperated."
45:04;45:06;"The Adam driver's so exasperated."
45:06;45:07;"His wife is like,"
45:07;45:10;"we're going to my parents for Thanksgiving."
45:10;45:12;"And he's like, I can't, I can't."
45:12;45:12;"I got to crack this thing."
45:12;45:13;"- I got to work."
45:13;45:15;"- I don't have time."
45:15;45:17;"No, you haven't spent any time with the kids."
45:17;45:18;"We haven't seen my parents in two years."
45:18;45:19;"- Daddy, daddy."
45:19;45:21;"- You're getting on the plane."
45:21;45:23;"Daddy, daddy, please."
45:23;45:25;"- No, no, I promise."
45:25;45:26;"I will do something special for Christmas."
45:26;45:27;"- It's like planes and trains."
45:27;45:29;"- You're getting on that plane to Minnesota."
45:29;45:29;"- Exactly."
45:29;45:33;"You're getting on that plane to Minnesota."
45:33;45:35;"We're going to spend some time in my hometown."
45:35;45:36;"- Away."
45:36;45:41;"- And he's just, no, and he's so, he's so,"
45:41;45:42;"he's so angry."
45:42;45:44;"And he's like, he's huffing and puffing."
45:44;45:47;"He's sitting there and, and he, and oh my God,"
45:47;45:48;"I don't have time for this."
45:48;45:50;"And then it's Thanksgiving dinner."
45:50;45:53;"And he's like, he's looking around at the table."
45:53;45:55;"Turkey, we already tried that."
45:55;45:56;"Cranberry sauce."
45:56;45:57;"- Wait, wait, wait."
45:57;45:59;"Turkey, we already tried turkey coffee."
45:59;46:00;"- Yeah, turkey espresso."
46:00;46:01;"- Right?"
46:01;46:02;"- That's hard work."
46:02;46:06;"- We already tried the turkey espresso."
46:06;46:08;"Oh God."
46:08;46:08;"What are we?"
46:08;46:10;"Oh, it's the cranberry sauce."
46:10;46:11;"Mashed potatoes, tried it."
46:11;46:13;"- Roasted Brussels sprouts."
46:13;46:14;"- And then he's so pissed."
46:14;46:19;"Then at the end, the grandma brings out the pumpkin pie"
46:19;46:22;"and he's like, wait a second."
46:22;46:25;"And then she's like, can I offer anyone tea or coffee?"
46:25;46:26;"And he's like, I gotta go."
46:26;46:27;"- The eureka moment."
46:27;46:28;"- He gets the first pumpkin pie."
46:28;46:29;"- You see, you have the whole family."
46:29;46:32;"He just takes the coffin, pours it all over the pie."
46:32;46:35;"- Dad, what are you doing?"
46:35;46:36;"- The (beep) are you doing?"
46:36;46:40;"- He yanks the whole pie out of grandma's hands,"
46:40;46:43;"dumps the big pitcher of coffee all over it."
46:43;46:45;"Everybody's like, what are you doing?"
46:45;46:48;"Dad, you got, he's gotten, he's lost his damn mind."
46:48;46:51;"I knew you shouldn't have married this monster."
46:51;46:53;"He stuffs his face in it."
46:53;46:54;"I gotta go."
46:54;46:56;"Runs out into the night."
46:56;47:00;"- Shirtless for some reason."
47:00;47:06;"- Grandpa grabs a shotgun, tries to shoot him."
47:06;47:08;"You ruined Thanksgiving."
47:08;47:09;"- Oh man."
47:09;47:10;"I mean, I love it."
47:10;47:11;"Starbucks, terrible coffee."
47:11;47:14;"And then they just add a bunch of like steamed milk"
47:14;47:17;"and sugar to their terrible coffee."
47:17;47:20;"And sorry, I have to, you got winners."
47:20;47:21;"Pumpkin spice."
47:21;47:23;"- The last sort of shot of the movie."
47:23;47:24;"He's been run off."
47:24;47:25;"The family's all around."
47:25;47:27;"You should have never married this guy."
47:27;47:29;"He's ruined Thanksgiving."
47:29;47:32;"Everybody sort of goes to bed."
47:32;47:33;"It's every, you know, all the dishes are out"
47:33;47:35;"and the wife just feels so bad."
47:35;47:39;"She just walks downstairs and she just sees this pumpkin pie"
47:39;47:42;"that is now sort of just in coffee."
47:42;47:43;"And she just sort of looks at it."
47:43;47:45;"You think she's like, I can't believe I married this (beep)"
47:45;47:47;"but then she takes a bite."
47:47;47:49;"And she's just like, I can't believe it."
47:49;47:51;"- I know why I married him."
47:51;47:52;"- Yeah."
47:52;47:55;"She calls him and she's like, just do it."
47:55;47:57;"- Peter Dukes, you did it."
47:57;47:58;"Now that's the man I married."
47:58;47:59;"- Peter baby."
47:59;48:01;"(laughing)"
48:01;48:02;"- Wait, is that right?"
48:02;48:03;"Is it Peter Dukes?"
48:03;48:04;"- Yeah."
48:04;48:05;"Peter Dukes, you did it."
48:05;48:06;"- Peter Dukes, you crazy son of a (beep)"
48:06;48:08;"- Yeah, he's really apologetic."
48:08;48:09;"I'm so sorry."
48:09;48:10;"I don't know what came over me."
48:10;48:12;"She's like, no, no, no, don't apologize."
48:12;48:14;"- And maybe it's one of those movies like Michael Clayton"
48:14;48:16;"or it's just called Peter Dukes."
48:16;48:18;"(laughing)"
48:18;48:25;"And everyone's like, what's this new Bradley Cooper movie"
48:25;48:27;"about it's called Peter Dukes."
48:27;48:30;"And people are like, oh yeah, David Fincher directed it."
48:30;48:31;"Like, what is it?"
48:31;48:31;"- Oh yeah."
48:31;48:35;"- Oh no, it's about the creation of the pumpkin spice."
48:35;48:40;"- Q4 holiday release, prestige title."
48:40;48:41;"- Oh yeah, man."
48:41;48:42;"- There's your Oscar right there."
48:42;48:45;"- Against some huge Marvel movie."
48:45;48:47;"- Coming up Thanksgiving weekend."
48:47;48:48;"- Peter."
48:48;48:49;"(laughing)"
48:49;48:51;"- And it's like, at the Academy Awards,"
48:51;48:56;"it's just like, and what nomination for best picture,"
48:56;48:56;"Peter Dukes."
48:56;49:01;"And it goes to a scene of Bradley Cooper dumping"
49:01;49:03;"the pot of coffee on the pie."
49:03;49:06;"Get the hell out of here."
49:06;49:09;"- Jennifer Lawrence is just, what are you doing?"
49:09;49:11;"- Oh, like Kevin Hart does a bit when he's hosting."
49:11;49:14;"Like he gives out pumpkin spice to the audience,"
49:14;49:16;"like as part of his like opening monologue."
49:16;49:20;"- Oh yeah, lots of Peter Dukes jokes."
49:20;49:22;"- Got a riff on the Peter Dukes title."

50:29;50:35;"- What else is on the fall menu besides pumpkin spice?"
50:35;50:38;"- This year they did roll out a cold brew."
50:38;50:41;"It's the pumpkin cream cold brew."
50:41;50:44;"And that combines their normal cold brew"
50:44;50:46;"with sweet vanilla syrup,"
50:46;50:50;"with pumpkin cream cold foam and pumpkin spice."
50:50;50:52;"And also they have another beverage"
50:52;50:55;"called the apple crisp macchiato."
50:55;50:56;"Jake, I see you're intrigued."
50:56;50:59;"- What are the calorie counts on those iced beverages?"
50:59;51:01;"- Zero calories."
51:01;51:02;"- You're lying."
51:02;51:04;"- Yeah, I don't know."
51:04;51:07;"- I think it's probably hitting a thousand."
51:07;51:09;"- Wow, you think that high?"
51:09;51:10;"- A thousand?"
51:10;51:11;"Yeah, you'd be surprised."
51:11;51:14;"- For like a 16 ounce, what was it?"
51:14;51:15;"Pumpkin cream?"
51:15;51:20;"- It was the pumpkin, yeah, the pumpkin cream cold brew."
51:20;51:21;"- It's so upsetting."
51:21;51:23;"- I mean, maybe the sugar."
51:23;51:24;"- I got it."
51:24;51:26;"- I mean, that's like a hamburger and fries."
51:26;51:27;"- Hold on, I got it."
51:27;51:30;"We got to confirm what this is."
51:30;51:32;"Pumpkin cream."
51:32;51:34;"Live Googling, folks."
51:34;51:36;"Let me get a pumpkin cream cold brew."
51:36;51:38;"- Oh, it's not too crazy."
51:38;51:41;"250 calories."
51:41;51:42;"- What about a pumpkin spice latte?"
51:42;51:45;"- Extra pump of pumpkin."
51:45;51:46;"- Pumpkin."
51:46;51:47;"(laughing)"
51:47;51:49;"- And of course this depends on the size."
51:49;51:49;"- Yeah, hold on."
51:49;51:52;"- Extra pump of pumpkin."
51:52;51:54;"- Well, Jake crunches that just to,"
51:54;51:58;"just for comparison, a Big Mac is 563 calories."
51:58;51:59;"- Just the burger."
51:59;52:00;"- Just the burger."
52:00;52:02;"So if you're doing two,"
52:02;52:04;"I guess that's like having a Big Mac."
52:04;52:08;"- Pumpkin spice lattes coming in at 380."
52:08;52:10;"- Okay, so it's like three quarters of a Big Mac."
52:10;52:12;"- Yeah, it's not saying what size it is,"
52:12;52:13;"but it looks like."
52:13;52:15;"- Probably the medium."
52:15;52:17;"- 50 grams of sugar, no big deal."
52:17;52:22;"- Okay, but I'm interested in what other flavors are there."
52:22;52:25;"There's the pumpkin flavor profile."
52:25;52:27;"Now I guess there's Apple crisp,"
52:27;52:28;"also represents fall."
52:28;52:29;"Anything else?"
52:29;52:31;"- I'm just going to go ahead and Google"
52:31;52:32;"Starbucks fall drinks."
52:32;52:35;"- Yeah, I'm looking that up as well."
52:35;52:36;"- Fall drinks are back folks."
52:36;52:38;"I'm over at starbucks.com right now."
52:38;52:40;"- What about like maple syrup?"
52:40;52:41;"That's kind of autumnal."
52:41;52:43;"- Oh, they got the pumpkin cream cheese muffin."
52:43;52:47;"If you're looking for like a pastry, pumpkin scone,"
52:47;52:50;"that's not new, but it's bad pumpkin loaf."
52:50;52:53;"That's a year round treat."
52:53;52:54;"Get that anytime."
52:54;52:55;"- Is there no maple syrup?"
52:55;52:58;"There's not a maple, maple macchiato."
52:58;52:59;"We got a caramel apple spice."
52:59;53:02;"We got a steamed apple juice."
53:02;53:04;"We got a pumpkin spice cream."
53:04;53:07;"Again, the website at starbucks.com, not great."
53:07;53:10;"- Oh, there's a maple cinnamon macchiato."
53:10;53:11;"Oh wait, no, no, no."
53:11;53:13;"This is Starbucks at home."
53:13;53:15;"So there's a recipe on their site"
53:15;53:15;"for how you can make that."
53:15;53:17;"- This is terrible radio."
53:17;53:18;"- No, it's good."
53:18;53:19;"- Okay."
53:19;53:20;"- This is compelling stuff."
53:20;53:21;"- If you say."
53:21;53:22;"- I would listen."
53:22;53:22;"- There's listen."
53:22;53:25;"We got, there's two types of time crisis listeners."
53:25;53:27;"There's people who want to hear four hours"
53:27;53:30;"of a deep dive on Bob Dylan's greatest hits, volume three."
53:30;53:33;"And then you got the freaks who want to hear"
53:33;53:35;"a solid 90 minutes."
53:35;53:37;"- There's an apple crisp macchiato."
53:37;53:38;"- On Starbucks menu."
53:38;53:39;"- That's the other introduction."
53:39;53:42;"- A lot of variations on the theme of pumpkin spice"
53:42;53:43;"and apple crisp."
53:43;53:45;"Those are the tent poles."
53:45;53:48;"And then they're kind of pivoting from those two flavors."
53:48;53:49;"- Okay."
53:49;53:50;"And by the way, that maple macchiato,"
53:50;53:54;"that was discontinued in 2014, it looks like."
53:54;53:55;"But you can still."
53:55;53:57;"You can still get it in Canada."
53:57;53:58;"- Actually, you know what, Seinfeld,"
53:58;54:01;"another thing that this got me thinking about"
54:01;54:05;"is what's going on at Tim Hortons in the fall?"
54:05;54:06;"Like the other big chains,"
54:06;54:10;"have they been forced to adopt pumpkin?"
54:10;54:12;"- Oh yeah, no, Tim Hortons is on the whole trend."
54:12;54:15;"They've got a full pumpkin spice lineup"
54:15;54:18;"and they've got a new maple collection as of this year."
54:18;54:20;"This just in."
54:20;54:23;"So if you want to know, here's the full rundown."
54:23;54:26;"You got pumpkin spice dream donut."
54:26;54:27;"You got the creamy maple pecan."
54:27;54:29;"- Pumpkin spice dream donut?"
54:29;54:30;"- Yeah, it's a dream donut."
54:30;54:31;"- It's got some melatonin."
54:31;54:33;"- Yeah, and it's got-"
54:33;54:34;"- Some magnesium and melatonin."
54:34;54:36;"- It might knock you out if you eat it late enough."
54:36;54:39;"It's got the fall colored orange fondant,"
54:39;54:41;"which Jake, I know you like a good orange fondant."
54:41;54:45;"It's topped with candied praline pumpkin seeds."
54:45;54:47;"So they got the seeds in there,"
54:47;54:49;"giving you some real raw texture."
54:50;54:53;"And then it's got even more fondant."
54:53;54:54;"It's got a burst of white fondant."
54:54;54:56;"So this is-"
54:56;54:59;"- Is that like the way that in Canada,"
54:59;55:02;"all documents have to be in English and French,"
55:02;55:04;"even if you're in like British Columbia"
55:04;55:06;"and nobody speaks French?"
55:06;55:07;"Is there also some kind of rule"
55:07;55:10;"that every donut has to contain some fondant?"
55:10;55:13;"- Yes, there's a certain fondant quotient"
55:13;55:16;"in most food stops in Canada."
55:16;55:19;"You got the creamy maple pecan dream donut,"
55:19;55:20;"pumpkin spice muffin,"
55:20;55:24;"which I think Starbucks has the exact same menu item."
55:24;55:27;"Iced cappuccino, there's a pumpkin spice iced cappuccino."
55:27;55:30;"And actually, this is what,"
55:30;55:32;"when we were talking about the calorie count."
55:32;55:35;"So my first job was at Tim Hortons when I was 16."
55:35;55:37;"I'm sure we talked about this."
55:37;55:39;"- Wait, did we?"
55:39;55:40;"- Oh, probably years."
55:40;55:43;"- This seems like a real kind of-"
55:43;55:44;"- It's kind of a bombshell."
55:44;55:46;"- Yeah, I don't think we have."
55:46;55:47;"- I'm sure we talked about this."
55:47;55:49;"- Sometimes you're too polite in Canadian."
55:49;55:52;"You gotta tell us this stuff."
55:52;55:54;"- I think you gotta number yourself on this one."
55:54;55:56;"- I only bring it up because the iced cappuccino"
55:56;55:59;"at Tim Hortons was famously such a high calorie beverage"
55:59;56:00;"that it was almost like a talking point."
56:00;56:03;"Like, can you believe that there are,"
56:03;56:05;"and I looked it up, there's 360."
56:05;56:06;"They must've reduced that."
56:06;56:09;"I seem to remember it being twice as high calorie."
56:09;56:12;"- That's rivaling that pumpkin spice latte."
56:12;56:12;"- Correct."
56:12;56:13;"- Upper threes."
56:13;56:14;"- You were a cashier."
56:14;56:17;"You were not making the iced cappuccino yourself?"
56:17;56:18;"- No, I was."
56:18;56:19;"I was making the iced cap."
56:19;56:20;"I was on the drive-thru."
56:20;56:22;"I was a cashier."
56:22;56:23;"I was doing the chili."
56:23;56:25;"I was doing the whole, you wear a lot of hats."
56:25;56:27;"You wear a lot of visors."
56:27;56:28;"- Someone pulls up, they're like,"
56:28;56:30;"""Good morning, Seinfeld."
56:30;56:31;"""Let me get a-"""
56:31;56:33;"- Wait, what accent is that?"
56:33;56:34;"That's a French Canadian?"
56:34;56:38;"- I'm doing a French Canadian guy talking to you."
56:38;56:39;"Hey, good morning, Seinfeld."
56:39;56:42;"Let me get, oh no, this is really bad, sorry."
56:42;56:43;"(laughing)"
56:43;56:44;"Let me get an iced cappuccino."
56:44;56:45;"- I gotta stop you there."
56:45;56:46;"Two things."
56:46;56:48;"So this was a long time ago."
56:48;56:50;"So I wasn't Seinfeld at the time."
56:50;56:52;"And also he wouldn't have, oh, this is a regular."
56:52;56:55;"So this person knows me already in this scenario."
56:55;56:56;"- Yeah, yeah."
56:56;56:57;"- Okay, got it, okay."
56:57;56:58;"- You're saying into the loudspeaker,"
56:58;56:59;"""Welcome to Tim Hortons."
56:59;57:00;"""This is Seinfeld."
57:00;57:01;"""How may I help you?"""
57:01;57:03;"- Oh, I'm introducing myself."
57:03;57:04;"- Yeah."
57:04;57:05;"- I'm introducing myself by name."
57:05;57:06;"- Good morning, Seinfeld."
57:06;57:10;"Let me get my usual, the iced cappuccino."
57:10;57:11;"And you're just like,"
57:11;57:14;"- Extra scorched pumpkin, please."
57:14;57:16;"- I have to remind you, of course,"
57:16;57:19;"that this is a very high calorie beverage."
57:19;57:22;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it all before Seinfeld just made."
57:22;57:25;"- Now I noticed you've done me in a French accent as well"
57:25;57:27;"in that scenario, which is fine."
57:27;57:29;"- No, no, I was trying to do your Anglo accent."
57:29;57:29;"- Oh, I see, okay."
57:29;57:30;"- One question I have for you is,"
57:30;57:33;"what neighborhood was the Tim Hortons in?"
57:33;57:37;"- Oh, that would have been in MDG in Montreal."
57:37;57:39;"- And we covered some of this stuff with Chromia."
57:39;57:41;"We actually had a great conversation"
57:41;57:43;"about the whole history of language"
57:43;57:46;"and the Quebecois identity politics and things like that."
57:46;57:50;"When you're a young guy who speaks English at home,"
57:50;57:53;"working at Tim Hortons,"
57:53;57:55;"does everybody come to the drive-thru speaking English"
57:55;57:57;"or you have to be ready to be bilingual?"
57:57;57:59;"- You gotta be ready to be bilingual."
57:59;58:02;"And that was like, that's an Anglophone neighborhood."
58:02;58:04;"So, you know, you're kind of getting half and half,"
58:04;58:07;"but I was pretty good at French back then."
58:07;58:10;"And then I've since gotten quite rusty at it."
58:10;58:11;"- Bonjour, Seinfeld."
58:11;58:13;"(laughing)"
58:13;58:14;"- So the year is like '98."
58:14;58:17;"Seinfeld is still on television at the time."
58:17;58:20;"And I'm being called, it's just confusing."
58:20;58:23;"But anyway, the reason I brought that up"
58:23;58:24;"was because it reminded me,"
58:24;58:25;"this conversation reminded me"
58:25;58:28;"of what a high calorie beverage the iced cappuccino is."
58:28;58:30;"And the way you make the iced cappuccino"
58:30;58:32;"is it's a sludge that comes out of a machine."
58:32;58:36;"So you turn a crank, it's a dark brown sludge,"
58:36;58:38;"and then you pour in cream,"
58:38;58:40;"and then there's like a mixing thing."
58:40;58:42;"And it's quite, it's like a syrup."
58:42;58:44;"It's a sludgy syrup."
58:44;58:46;"And now they have the pumpkin spice version of it"
58:46;58:47;"just to bring it back to."
58:47;58:48;"- Interesting."
58:48;58:51;"I mean, I do remember Seinfeld,"
58:51;58:53;"us talking about Tim Hortons,"
58:53;58:55;"and you telling us about how"
58:55;58:59;"they have to like throw the coffee out every hour."
58:59;59:01;"- Their slogan is always fresh."
59:01;59:02;"I don't know if it's that anymore,"
59:02;59:05;"but it's 20, every 20 minutes you dump, there's a timer."
59:05;59:07;"- I totally remember you telling us that."
59:07;59:10;"Maybe you quickly said, 'cause I used to work there"
59:10;59:11;"and we didn't dwell on it,"
59:11;59:14;"or maybe you're just being very cool."
59:14;59:16;"And you said, ""Yeah, you know, up there,"
59:16;59:19;"they're always throwing that coffee out after about an hour."""
59:19;59:21;"Like, oh, that's an interesting fact."
59:21;59:23;"- You just took it for granted."
59:23;59:26;"I just feel like this couldn't have not come up in the past."
59:26;59:27;"- I feel like you took it for granted"
59:27;59:30;"that it was just a great Seinfeld number crunch."
59:30;59:33;"Obviously he knows every 20 minutes."
59:33;59:35;"He looked it up."
59:35;59:37;"- Well, I think it was in their commercials though"
59:37;59:38;"for a while, like they'd be like,"
59:38;59:40;"always fresh, we always pour out the coffee."
59:40;59:41;"I seem to recall that being like,"
59:41;59:44;"you'd even see a shot of them dumping the coffee"
59:44;59:45;"in the commercial."
59:45;59:46;"- Right."
59:46;59:50;"Just dumping out that coffee"
59:50;59:53;"while some like freezing cold homeless person watches."
59:53;59:58;"- 20 minutes is, that's a pretty quick turnaround."
59:58;01:00:00;"- It's always fresh."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"That's their thing."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"- And by the way, when we dump this out,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"we're not giving it to anybody for free."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"It's going straight down the drain."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- Right down the sink."

01:00:53;01:00:55;"I worked at Quiznos."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"Seinfeld worked at Tim Hortons."
01:00:57;01:01:00;"Nick, you never got in the corporate food world?"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"- No, I worked at the Pentagon in high school."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"(laughing)"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- Jesus Christ."
01:01:06;01:01:06;"That's amazing."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"That's the ultimate franchise."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- The Pentagon cafeteria?"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- The ultimate brand."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- Yeah, I worked at the Starbucks"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"in the Pentagon cafeteria."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"No, this is a story probably for another time,"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"but you know that's when I worked"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"with Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Was during my period at,"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"I worked as an intern at the Pentagon"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"for the Department of Defense."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"- Wow, you had a proper Washington DC upbringing."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"- I did."
01:01:32;01:01:37;"My brother worked as a ice cream scooper for Ben and Jerry's."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- Okay."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"- And then was fired after he locked himself"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"in the walk-in freezer."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Whoa."
01:01:46;01:01:46;"- But-"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"- So what year were you at the Pentagon?"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"- It would have been '97."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"- So before, so Monica had-"
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- This is a whole-"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"- Been fired from the White House and was at the,"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"or whatever, let go unceremoniously"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"and was at the Pentagon?"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"- Yes, and I was there when everything went down"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"with Linda Tripp."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"- This was after the affair with Bill,"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"but before the news broke."
01:02:08;01:02:08;"- Yes."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- Whoa."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Yeah, no, this is heavy."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"This is almost for another,"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"this is another life for like another time."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- So did you have lunch and stuff with Monica?"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Yes."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- Y'all still tight?"
01:02:18;01:02:19;"- We are not."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"I ran into her one time years later."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Ran into?"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- It's almost like this has to almost get cut out"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"'cause it's too crazy."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- Why does it have to get cut out?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Or it doesn't have to get cut out."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"No, no, for no redacted reason other than-"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- Jake, it's classified."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Classified."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"(laughing)"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- You know, you guys, have I, I've told you this."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"- No, you've told me this story."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"I'm playing along 'cause it's interesting for the show."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"- I mean, I remember elements of it."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"- It's mind blowing."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"- I mean, do you want me to tell you the story quickly"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"and we can decide later?"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"- Of course."
01:02:46;01:02:46;"- Yeah."
01:02:46;01:02:49;"- So basically while at the ages that you were working"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"at a Quiznos or a Tim Hortons,"
01:02:51;01:02:56;"I got this job at the Pentagon"
01:02:56;01:03:00;"for basically the quickest version of the story is,"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"'cause it almost would make no sense,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"how would I get this job?"
01:03:03;01:03:06;"Is that it's not unusual growing up in Washington, DC"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"that someone would get a job somewhere in politics"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"working as some intern or page somewhere."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"It's not totally unusual."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"And I had an internship."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"I applied for a lot of internships"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"and I got one working for Bill Cohen"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"who is a Senator from Maine."
01:03:21;01:03:25;"And I was one of many interns or whatever over the summer"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"for him when he was a Senator."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"- This is a high school summer."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- A high school summer."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- Okay."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"- And this may be when I was a sophomore"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"or a junior in high school."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"- Okay."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- And he was gonna retire."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"So he said he announced his retirement."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"And when he announced retirement,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"all these other people had real jobs"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"and I was just a high school intern."
01:03:45;01:03:49;"So everyone had to leave to go get real jobs,"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"continue their careers wherever they were for the most part."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"And so I was one of just a very few handful of people"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"that was like, okay, well, I'll stay on and help you"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"because as you're winding down,"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"there's still (beep) to do around the office."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"Write constituents back, pack up boxes, whatever."
01:04:03;01:04:07;"And while he was setting to retire and everyone had left,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Bill Clinton asked him if he wanted to be,"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"offered him the job as the Secretary"
01:04:12;01:04:13;"for the Department of Defense."
01:04:13;01:04:16;"And so he basically said, anybody still with me?"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"And there was really three of us."
01:04:17;01:04:20;"You could have some position when I go to the Pentagon."
01:04:20;01:04:24;"And I was a junior going to become a senior in high school."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"So I was 17 turning 18."
01:04:27;01:04:31;"And I got an internship working for the Pentagon"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"and it was crazy."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"So every day after school,"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"I would just go and work at the Pentagon."
01:04:36;01:04:39;"- How would you get to the Pentagon from your school?"
01:04:39;01:04:40;"Take a bus? - Subway, yeah."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- Okay, subway. - A bus to a subway."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"- You'd get off, you'd walk to the Pentagon,"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"you'd show your badge."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"- I'd show my badge, I'd walk in."
01:04:46;01:04:50;"And at first they got me a job in the office"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"of public affairs, which is essentially PR."
01:04:53;01:04:57;"And when I started there, my boss was Linda Tripp."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"- Whoa, that's a trip."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"- Yeah, it's a trip."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"And so I would go and I'd do just sort of,"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"like faxing and stuff."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"And she, like faxing, copying, whatever."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"Like not, just intern work, get coffee type work."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"And then she was like,"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"are you going to this company picnic?"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"Like on Saturday, I was like, I don't drive."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I wasn't planning on it."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"I'm so much younger than anybody else who works here."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"And she's like, I'll pick you up."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"There's somebody I think you should meet."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"And so I took a subway to Crystal City."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"She picked me up."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"- Linda. - Linda picked me up"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"from the subway."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"And she was like, we're going to go pick up someone."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"And we picked up, she picked up Monica Lewinsky."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"And we all, you know, the three of us"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"went to this picnic together."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"And I basically, that's when I became friends with her."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And we would have lunch."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"And like, that's where I got to know her."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"- And so she, at that point,"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"she was like in her mid twenties or something?"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"- Yeah, she had to be young."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"- She was out of college."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"- She was out of college."
01:05:55;01:05:59;"And she, I mean, the most memorable thing about this story"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"is she was like, well, what do you want to do?"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"And I was like, well, I worked at the Senate"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"and now I'm at the Pentagon."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"I thought maybe I wanted to go into politics."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"I just didn't know what I wanted to do."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"So I was like, well, maybe I'll go work"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"for the justice department or something."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"I don't know."
01:06:10;01:06:10;"And she was like,"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"do you want to have an internship at the White House?"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"And I was like, yeah,"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"but it's like impossible to get an internship"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"at the White House."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"You know, they actually like, it just,"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"it's not even saying you apply for it."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"It's like saying they like give to like,"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"like decorated like soldiers, you know?"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Like it's just not, it's not like anywhere else."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"It's not like real internship."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"And she goes, I can get you a job at the White House."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"- Damn."
01:06:30;01:06:32;"- And you're like, how?"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"How do you have that much pull at the White House?"
01:06:33;01:06:38;"- It was such a crazy thing to be told that I just,"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"I mean, to this day, I just remember someone saying that."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"And she was just like, it was so casual."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"She was like, I can get you a job at the White House."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"And I was like, oh, oh word."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"And so then we sort of were friends"
01:06:49;01:06:53;"and I became closer with Linda Tripp over this period."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"And I did some really crazy project"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"where they're all tell you about another time."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"And then I went on vacation with my family."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- Plan 9/11."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"- Yeah, Plan 9/11."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Inside, inside job."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"I went on--"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"- 17 year olds are plenty."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"- I went on winter."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"When I tell you the thing that I did, it was (beep)"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:07:13;01:07:13;"- It was so crazy."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"But I went on this vacation."
01:07:14;01:07:18;"So I went on vacation and this is 90s."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"- This is early '98."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"- This is '97 going into '98."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"- Yep, and that's what blew up."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"- So it's December '97."
01:07:24;01:07:29;"I come back beginning of January and Monica's gone."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Linda's gone."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"It's everybody's gone basically."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"- You're like my homies, where'd they go?"
01:07:34;01:07:38;"- And someone came up to me, a friend who was,"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"you know, had become or someone who saw"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"that I was the youngest person working there"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"and they were higher level."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"And they said, if anybody asks you,"
01:07:46;01:07:49;"if you worked with Linda Tripp, you say no."
01:07:49;01:07:53;"And just trust me, like you will not graduate high school."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"And like your life will be ruined."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"That's all that they said."
01:07:58;01:08:02;"Like she's not here and they intuited, you cannot."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"I mean, it's so crazy for me to tell this story."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"I mean, Jake knows this and I've told him this,"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"but they were like, basically like just if any press"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"or anyone comes calling, you just didn't work with her."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"It's, you know, you worked in the same place."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"You don't know much about her."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"- Whoa."
01:08:16;01:08:19;"- And then I went to college that September, October,"
01:08:19;01:08:22;"and I was sitting in the hall in Carmanate,"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"you know, where, you know, at Columbia."
01:08:25;01:08:29;"And everyone who was the, Monica Lewinsky was on,"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"you know, or it was Bill Clinton saying"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"he didn't have sexual relations with that woman."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"And it all kind of flooded into me."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"I was like, oh, that's what I was experiencing"
01:08:36;01:08:40;"because I also would like, I would pick up like Linda's phone"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"and Monica would call crying."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"And she'd be like, where's Monica?"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"It was just like all this stuff that was happening"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"before then, like I didn't understand or pay attention to."
01:08:48;01:08:53;"But basically I was part of the entire sort of dissolution"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"of that relationship because they were best friends."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- Just very quickly for anybody,"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"I think everybody knows who Monica Lewinsky is,"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"but if people don't remember quite as well,"
01:09:03;01:09:07;"or Linda Tripp was her quote unquote friend"
01:09:07;01:09:11;"who she knew from working in DC who covertly recorded her"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"and kind of played her."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"- Yeah, and when all the news came out,"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"yeah, and everyone was like, why would she do this?"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"She's this evil woman."
01:09:19;01:09:24;"She had some kind of political agenda and had no,"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"you know, basically it was this cruel woman attacking"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"and abusing Monica."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"And my experience was, while that all may have been true,"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"it's like, this was a woman who in my experience was like,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"oh, you're young here and she's young here."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"You guys should hang out."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"I really love both of you."
01:09:39;01:09:42;"I mean, it was a very sort of maternal relationship."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"I mean, that's the most I could offer this conversation"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"is like whatever I experienced was like so crazily not,"
01:09:48;01:09:53;"it was not the public, it was not the, you know,"
01:09:53;01:09:57;"the media portrayal of that relationship."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"- And then you said you ran into Monica."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"- I did, I ran into Monica years later"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"at like some kind of conference and-"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"- What?"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"- She was like speaking at a conference."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"She was like speaking engagement stuff."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"And we talked about it and she like,"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"I mean, it was like a different one."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"I mean-"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- She remembered you?"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"- She remembered the experience, she did not remember me,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"but I hadn't seen, I mean, you know,"
01:10:19;01:10:24;"whatever her life has been so traumatic and so wild,"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"you know, whatever we've gone through,"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"whatever ups and downs,"
01:10:26;01:10:29;"I feel like there was probably a woman before"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"what happened to her and when it happened."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"So like, it just was not like talking to somebody"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"that you'd know, do you know what I mean?"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"- Yeah, that era is probably such a blur."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"She became this national figure,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"had to deal with this like insane press"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"and yeah, of course."
01:10:44;01:10:48;"- Yeah, and so that was, I did that."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"I mean, I just happened to fall into that"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"instead of working in like food service."

01:12:23;01:12:27;"I don't, if I remember correctly, it wasn't like a mall."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Now, a lot of people don't know this,"
01:12:28;01:12:32;"but the Pentagon cafeteria has the best chicken fingers"

01:12:54;01:12:57;"like a college, or I've never seen it in person,"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"but I've heard that there's some high schools"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"that have this, where there's just like"
01:13:00;01:13:04;"a straight up like Mickey D's, just like in the school."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"I know I've mentioned this on TC before,"
01:13:06;01:13:11;"but I vividly remember the hospital my sister was born at."

01:13:11;01:13:13;"- In New Jersey, it had a McDonald's."

01:13:15;01:13:16;"- So psyched."
01:13:16;01:13:19;"- Yeah, there was a Burger King in a hospital near"

01:13:33;01:13:35;"- Here you go, babe, love you."

01:14:04;01:14:05;"- Oh, I like this."
01:14:05;01:14:10;"- About a young boy's friendship with an older woman."
01:14:10;01:14:15;"But this, rather than be set in the 1970s San Fernando Valley"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"set in late 90s DC."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"So we have, you know, the Bill Clinton,"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Monica Lewinsky scandal."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"We have the planning of 9/11 happening."

01:14:26;01:14:28;"- I actually feel like, and again,"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"we can cut this if this is too long,"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"but a couple of things."
01:14:31;01:14:32;"- We're not cutting any of this."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"- Something just flooded back me."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"- Something more interesting than pumpkin spice latte."
01:14:36;01:14:36;"- Great."

01:14:38;01:14:40;"I'm gonna tell you what my job was there."
01:14:40;01:14:44;"Because it actually does, it's not relatable content,"
01:14:44;01:14:48;"but it's, there's something in here that relates to this."
01:14:48;01:14:52;"So basically, there was a project at the Pentagon"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference,"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"the JCOC for short."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"And the purpose of this was essentially"
01:14:59;01:15:04;"this giant marketing tool for the Pentagon"
01:15:04;01:15:07;"to get sort of influential people"
01:15:07;01:15:12;"to experience the military sort of top to bottom."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"Like every aspect of the military,"
01:15:13;01:15:17;"like all of the, you know, from the way you would say it,"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"from the, meet the Secretary of Defense"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"all the way to the guy that swabs the deck somewhere"
01:15:20;01:15:24;"and just get them on a giant seven day trip"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"to sort of see all the amazing things the military does."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"And this is, you know, which essentially"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"is to fly people of influence,"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"people that owns newspapers, whatever,"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"do everything that someone does from,"
01:15:37;01:15:43;"land on a aircraft carrier, fly in a jet, shoot-"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"- Literally like an influencer trip"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"before they had the words influencers, but for-"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- Before they had influencers, so-"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"- Hollywood directors."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"- For Rupert Murdoch."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"- For the Murdochs, and yeah, there's, you know,"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"I think that that was where they were looking"
01:15:56;01:15:59;"there was a bunch of, you know, sort of older,"
01:15:59;01:16:04;"probably more kind of conservative heads invited on the trip."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"- They said, ""We feel like we're pretty underrepresented"
01:16:06;01:16:10;"""in the kind of lo-fi indie rock category."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"""Is there anything you've been listening to lately?"""
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Well, that was sort of what they said."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"- And that's how Robert Pollard-"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"- They said, ""You know, because you're the youngest person"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"""here, we want to put you in charge"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"""of inviting people on this trip."""
01:16:23;01:16:24;"- Wow."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"- ""And expanding the guest list of this trip."""
01:16:26;01:16:28;"And I said, ""Well, there's someone who I think I really,"
01:16:28;01:16:32;"""I think I personally would really love to go on this trip."""
01:16:32;01:16:33;"- Jay Manascus."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"- Jerry Seinfeld."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"- Wow."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"- No, I swear to God."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"- Full circle."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"- I swear to God, that's why I was looking at Seinfeld,"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"I was like, ""Oh, maybe I will say what I did."""
01:16:43;01:16:43;"- Oh my God."
01:16:43;01:16:47;"- And so I talked to Seinfeld, I talked to his people,"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"I got his credit card, I got the,"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"he was doing the American Express ads,"
01:16:51;01:16:52;"and like I got his American Express"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"for anything that they would need."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"I mean, I went, he was gonna go on this trip."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- Wow."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"- Whatever happened, he ended up not going,"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"but like I forget who else,"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"I think I actually told Hannah and Jake at one point,"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"some of the other people,"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"but I so specifically remember the experience"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"with getting Seinfeld to go on this trip"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"and trying to lock him in."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"And I think I also was like,"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"""I want to get Bruce Springsteen on this trip."""
01:17:13;01:17:15;"I mean, there's no way when I think of it as an adult,"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"like this is such a, it's such a, it's brutal."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Even the idea is very brutal."
01:17:20;01:17:20;"So--"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"- Yeah, it's enlisting civilians of influencers"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"to do this really exciting fun--"
01:17:26;01:17:26;"- Propaganda."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- The mythology. - Propaganda."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- Yeah, absolutely."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"- I'm 17 years old, I'm 18 years old."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"I don't really understand."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"And so then this is what happened."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"The Monica and Linda stuff happened,"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"I didn't understand, and she disappeared."
01:17:39;01:17:42;"They confiscated her computer, Monica was gone,"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"and me and this one other intern,"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"a woman named Lindsay who was in college level,"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"maybe 22 years old or just out of college,"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"were the two last people left on this trip."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"So I was in charge now of this, I don't know,"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"$50 million trip or whatever."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"So I did it, I went."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"- You went on this trip?"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- I went on the trip."
01:18:04;01:18:09;"I landed on an aircraft carrier in a Top Gun jet."
01:18:09;01:18:13;"I shot giant--"
01:18:13;01:18:13;"- This is crazy."
01:18:13;01:18:16;"- Gun, I know, I went, seven days I went"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"and experienced the Coast Guard, the Marines, the Navy."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"I went in a submarine."
01:18:21;01:18:24;"Like I did these things that just no one gets to do."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"- Did you spend the night on the aircraft carrier?"
01:18:26;01:18:26;"- Yes."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"And when we landed on the aircraft carrier,"
01:18:29;01:18:32;"we did the touch and go in the jet,"
01:18:32;01:18:35;"and it was like some older woman who I was probably"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"from like Knight Ridder newspapers,"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"like threw up on me right behind me."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"'Cause you know, you land and if you don't catch"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"the rubber band, just like in Top Gun,"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"you have to take right back off."
01:18:45;01:18:48;"So we did like four touch and goes before landing."
01:18:48;01:18:51;"Like I did all of this stuff at like 18 years old."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"It was genuinely insane."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"And I wasn't gonna go on it,"
01:18:54;01:18:57;"but then no one was around to do it."
01:18:57;01:18:59;"- So what did Lou Barlow think of all this?"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"(laughing)"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"- Wait, so Jerry--"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"- I'm a little bit disappointed"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"that what you pick all these like older guys."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"I mean, I guess maybe you needed to read the room,"
01:19:08;01:19:11;"but like there you are a young hip hop,"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"lo-fi indie rock fan."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"- What was that?"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"- You didn't invite like--"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"- What was that rock?"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"- I was actually thinking RZA probably would have gone."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Like I wasn't thinking straight."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"I read the room."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"- How did you not invite RZA?"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"- RZA would have gone."
01:19:25;01:19:26;"- Nick, do you have any ideas?"
01:19:26;01:19:29;"And you're like, I do have a few ideas."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"Let me read them down."
01:19:31;01:19:36;"RZA, GZA, Ghostface Killer, Rayquan the Chef, Method Man."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"- Tell me how many slots you have"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"because I have about seven people."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"(laughing)"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"- Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang Killer Beast, we're on a swarm."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"Wu-Tang Killer Beast, we're on a swarm."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"Wu-Tang Killer Beast, we're on a swarm."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Wu-Tang Killer Beast, we're on a swarm."
01:19:53;01:19:57;"The RZA, the GZA, old Dirty Bass and Inspector Dick."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"You got Ghostface Killer, the Method Man,"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Rayquan the Chef, the Master Killer,"
01:20:02;01:20:05;"the Messiah, the Vaughn, Power Cipher,"

01:20:50;01:20:52;"- So Jerry was supposed to stay for seven."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"- And Jerry, we got very far along,"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"so much so that I remember, like,"
01:20:56;01:21:00;"for whatever reasons, needing his American Express"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"and getting the American Express,"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"and just, it was the time that Jerry Seinfeld"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"was doing the American Express commercials."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"- With Super Justice. - And just, yeah."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"And just thinking, this is incredible."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"- So you were in touch with Jerry's people?"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"- Yes."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"- And then at the end of it, Jerry was like,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"""Eh, the military."""
01:21:16;01:21:19;"- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"It's funny, we got so far down,"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"and I'm thinking with who else,"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"but yeah, I think that at some point,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"I mean, obviously the optics are insane now,"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"and no one would get that far along,"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"you know what I mean?"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"Like, at some point, someone would be like,"
01:21:32;01:21:35;"""I don't know if you wanna have this on, like,"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"""social media that you went into this,"""
01:21:37;01:21:38;"but obviously it was a different time."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"- Well, a lot of people would love to have that"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"in their social media."
01:21:42;01:21:44;"- Yeah, but I think that even then,"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"it's just interesting to think about."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"- Tyler, the creator, issues apology"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"after US military propaganda trip."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"Guys, I'm sorry, some random 15-year-old kid in DC"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"invited me on this."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"I thought it was kinda like cool punk rock thing."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"I was so wrong."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"I mean, you know. - I got a DM"
01:22:01;01:22:02;"from a 15-year-old."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"- Friend of the show, Kid Rock,"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"would totally jump at that opportunity."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"- Right, of course."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- He'd love it."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Oh my God."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"- That's amazing, man."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"- I haven't thought about this in so long."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"I mean-"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"- I've never heard the part about the-"
01:22:16;01:22:16;"- The trip."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"- The booking the trip and doing the trip."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"- Do they still do this?"
01:22:20;01:22:23;"This is how, like, marketing works?"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"- This is, yeah, the joint civilian."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"- I mean, it's probably a bit more sophisticated."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"I mean, I always just assumed that so much of this stuff"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"also just works with, like, a major reporter"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"at a major newspaper having a contact"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"who they get to know really well,"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"who basically is like, takes him out for lunch"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"at the Pentagon, is like,"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"""Oh, you gotta try the chicken fingers,"""
01:22:41;01:22:42;"and then say, like,"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"""I'm really not supposed to tell you this,"
01:22:43;01:22:47;"but we got some pretty serious intel"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"on whatever I want you to think."""
01:22:49;01:22:51;"And they're like, ""Oh, for real?"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"Oh, can I talk about that?"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"Mm, you probably, okay, here."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"I'll let you talk about it in your newspaper"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"as long as you just say, 'Sources at the Pentagon.'"""
01:22:58;01:22:59;"Okay, thanks, man."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"You're really doing me a solid."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"- I never looked it up."
01:23:02;01:23:07;"At, you know, defense.org/jcoc, the J-C-O-C."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Is DOD's oldest and most prestigious"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"public liaison program."

01:23:18;01:23:21;"to have the full immersive experience with their military."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I mean, I just have a feeling people are gonna start"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"roasting me on Twitter for even talking about doing this."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"- No, who cares, dude?"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"(laughing)"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"You were a kid."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"- I definitely was like, I was a kid,"
01:23:33;01:23:37;"and I did not expect to do any of this stuff."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"- But what a funny world."
01:23:38;01:23:42;"I mean, they definitely, they put a 17-year-old"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"in charge of this project."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"- That's insane."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"- You were put in charge of the project"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"because of Monica and Linda, like,"
01:23:50;01:23:53;"being basically apprehended by the FBI."
01:23:53;01:23:54;"- Yeah, totally."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"I mean, we were so far along, 'cause yeah,"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"it was happening just like two or three months later."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"- That's wild."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"- I mean, it does sound like licorice pizza"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"meets ""Almost Famous"" meets ""War Games."""
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- ""Con Air."""

01:24:07;01:24:08;"(laughing)"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"- ""Con Air."""
01:24:09;01:24:11;"- All right."
01:24:12;01:24:17;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:24:17;01:24:22;"- This week on the top five, what are we doing?"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"I actually don't know."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"- 2003. - Someone tell me."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"- We're doing this week in 2003"
01:24:27;01:24:32;"versus the global rock charts or whatever, what is it?"
01:24:32;01:24:36;"- Global hit music chart."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Wait, what?"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- There goes getting out of here on time."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"- Somebody needs to explain this."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"- What are we doing?"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- We're doing something complicated."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"- It's the top global rock music streams, right?"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Digital stream downloads."
01:24:48;01:24:51;"- It's purchased rock MP3s."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"- I think, Matt, you got to jump in here, Matt."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"- It's the rock digital sales chart."
01:24:55;01:24:59;"- LimeWire presents the MP4."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"- This is because we talked about"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"the rock digital sales charts"
01:25:02;01:25:05;"because ""Murder Most Foul"" was number one on it."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- We're doing the top five from this week in 2003"
01:25:07;01:25:12;"versus the top five on whatever the chart is for 2022."
01:25:12;01:25:15;"- Oh, okay, all right."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"You guys were just joking, okay."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"- I was joking around."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"I just didn't, I don't know the name of the chart."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"It's something very Orwellian."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"It's just the global."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"- The Apple Music Global Chart."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"- Okay. - The Big Brother chart."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"- Yep, the Big Brother Global Chart."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"- This week on the top five, we're doing speed mode"
01:25:33;01:25:37;"because we got places to be all around the world."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"We're looking at 2003."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"- To see my brother play at Zebulon"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"after we finish recording."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- Oh man, there's a DP's show?"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"- Not a DP show."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"Dave's doing some songs with a buddy of his."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"Kind of informal."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"I think it's a free show at Zebulon tonight."
01:25:53;01:25:55;"- Interesting. - Yep."
01:25:55;01:25:55;"- Acoustic?"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"- I don't know, but I'm going to go."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"And then I'm seeing Little Wings tomorrow night."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"- Oh, word."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"- And then I'm seeing LA Takedown on Friday night."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"This is a busy music week for me."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"- Wow."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Stacked. - Yep."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"- Damn, wish I was in LA for that."
01:26:10;01:26:14;"All right, 2003, the number five song this week in 2003,"
