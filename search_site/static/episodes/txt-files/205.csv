00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:10;"On today's episode, we'll be joined by author and screenwriter, Carson Mel."
00:10;00:17;"We'll dig deep on the Jay Giles Band and their potential connections to Bruce Springsteen."
00:17;00:26;"All that, plus new music from Jungkook, Taylor Swift, and old music from Mary Hopkin."
00:27;00:32;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:22;01:23;"What up?"
01:23;01:25;"What's up, Jake? What's up, Seinfeld?"
01:25;01:27;"You see what I'm holding up here?"
01:27;01:29;"Wow. A Snickers."
01:29;01:33;"This is one of, I think we've discussed this on the show before,"
01:33;01:37;"this is one of probably a half dozen Snickers I'll eat this year."
01:37;01:38;"[laughs]"
01:38;01:42;"This was a desperation move ten minutes before showtime."
01:42;01:47;"I'm working in my studio, I'm like, ""Uh-oh, we're taping in ten."
01:47;01:48;"I'm going to be hungry."""
01:48;01:52;"Made a quick run to the corner store, picked up a six-pack and a Snickers."
01:52;01:55;"Are you going to drink beer as you eat the Snickers?"
01:55;01:59;"Yeah, well, I'm working on some peanut M&Ms right now, so I'm doing the candy beer combo."
01:59;02:02;"Beer and candy has always been a weird combo."
02:02;02:04;"Dude, it's a weird combo."
02:04;02:11;"Honestly, being 46 on the doorstep of 47 and rocking beer candy is hitting kind of rough right now."
02:11;02:16;"I smell beer and candy. Yeah."
02:16;02:20;"Actually, can we throw on Sex and Candy? Have we ever talked about this, Jake?"
02:20;02:21;"I'm actually very curious."
02:21;02:23;"I don't think we have."
02:23;02:26;"Okay, take me back to '97."
02:26;02:30;"You're hearing Sex and Candy by Marcy Playground everywhere."
02:30;02:36;"What's the 20-year-old collegiate GBV fan Jake thinking about this song?"
02:36;02:38;"I never liked the song."
02:38;02:43;"Hanging around downtown by myself."
02:43;02:44;"Big Nirvana."
02:44;02:48;"I had so much time to sit and think about myself."
02:48;02:49;"This verse."
02:49;02:51;"And there she was."
02:51;02:58;"Oh, totally, but then the delivery is almost little Malcomus, dinosaur, disaffected."
02:58;02:59;"No."
02:59;03:01;"But Kurt had that gear."
03:01;03:03;"It sounds a little bit like Malcomus to me."
03:03;03:08;"I smell sex and candy."
03:08;03:13;"Who's that lounging in my chair?"
03:13;03:17;"I can honestly see this being a pavement song, but with a different groove."
03:17;03:24;"This guy's kind of leaning into this nasty, kind of sexy groove."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:30;"Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream."
03:30;03:33;"How about this for a cover band?"
03:33;03:37;"We cover songs in the style of pavement."
03:37;03:43;"So we take more mainstream alternative rock radio hits from the '90s"
03:43;03:44;"and just do them a little pavement."
03:44;03:47;"For instance, Marcy Playground, it's not a million miles away,"
03:47;03:49;"but we do it more of a pavement groove."
03:49;03:50;"Yeah."
03:50;03:51;"The guitars get a little noisier."
03:51;03:52;"Yeah, I like that."
03:52;03:57;"In platform double suede, yeah, there she was."
03:57;04:00;"Yeah, this could honestly--it'll have those kind of cool turnarounds."
04:00;04:03;"This could have been on Bright in the Corners."
04:03;04:09;"I smell sex and candy."
04:09;04:12;"Who's that lounging in my chair?"
04:12;04:16;"It is a great chorus, and it's admirably restrained."
04:16;04:22;"Yeah, my memory of this is that it was way more kind of like funk inflected,"
04:22;04:27;"and it's much more, like you said, kind of more of a comic or something."
04:27;04:31;"Yeah."
04:31;04:39;"But I didn't like it because it was like, oh, this is the major label radio version of better bands."
04:39;04:43;"I was a snobby 20-year-old."
04:43;04:46;"I smell sex and candy."
04:46;04:49;"And I guess for me, I think of pavement because it's just a touch of--"
04:49;04:52;"A shady lane everybody wants one."
04:52;04:53;"Yeah."
04:53;04:56;"No, it's not a million miles from something on Bright in the Corners."
04:56;04:57;"Wait, when did Bright in the Corners come out?"
04:57;05:00;"'97."
05:00;05:01;"Something was in the air."
05:01;05:03;"Which came out first?"
05:03;05:07;"Wait, Seinfeld, I need a number crunch desperately."
05:07;05:08;"What's up?"
05:08;05:11;"When did Sex and Candy by Marcy Playground come out,"
05:11;05:14;"and when did Bright in the Corners by Pavement come out?"
05:14;05:19;"Throw on the first song on Bright in the Stereo."
05:19;05:26;"It doesn't sound like Sex and Candy, but I'm just kind of curious to do a comparison."
05:26;05:30;"All right, you got Sex and Candy, September 15, '97."
05:30;05:33;"You got Bright in the Corners, February 11, '97."
05:33;05:34;"All right."
05:34;05:35;"OK."
05:43;05:46;"Yeah, you got that more aggressive, noisy side of pavement."
05:46;05:47;"Mm-hmm."
05:47;05:53;"I remember not being that psyched on this."
05:56;06:08;"I remember being kind of turned off by this sing-songy, kind of rappy, Beck vibe."
06:08;06:10;"Yeah."
06:10;06:12;"The chorus is sick on this, though."
06:41;06:44;"I wonder if Marcy Playground ever rocked out."
06:44;06:47;"I'm ashamed to say I only know one of their songs."
06:47;06:49;"I don't know anything about them."
06:52;06:59;"But I do hear the similarity in the delivery."
06:59;07:01;"Yeah."
07:01;07:03;"It's very '90s."
07:06;07:10;"To me, it almost reminds me of Nirvana, like Polly or something."
07:13;07:19;"Stanfield, are you a Marcy Playground fan?"
07:19;07:21;"Oh, I love all the deep cuts of Marcy."
07:21;07:23;"No, I only know the one song."
07:23;07:27;"But I did notice that the lead singer's name is John Wozniak."
07:27;07:30;"And I'm wondering if he's related to--"
07:30;07:31;"Oh, to Steve Woz?"
07:31;07:32;"To Woz?"
07:32;07:33;"To the Woz."
07:33;07:34;"Yeah, yeah."
07:34;07:36;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
07:36;07:37;"I'm on it."
07:40;07:52;"Now let's go back and hear track one on the Marcy Playground album,"
07:52;07:54;"assuming it's not Sex and Candy."
07:56;07:58;"OK, they do rock out."
07:58;07:59;"OK."
08:02;08:05;"[MUSIC - ""LONG LONG AGO IN CHINA""]"
08:05;08:22;"I can hear a solo Malcolmist song opening."
08:22;08:25;"(SINGING) Long, long ago in China, I'm told."
08:30;08:34;"I mean, these guys must have been pavement fans."
08:34;08:35;"(SINGING) Poppy."
08:38;08:40;"Maybe not."
08:40;08:41;"I don't know."
08:41;08:43;"Let's get a number crunch on that, too."
08:43;08:46;"Is Marcy Playground on record as being pavement fans?"
08:46;08:48;"Or are they like, you guys like pavement?"
08:48;08:50;"They'd be like, you know what, man, it really pisses me off"
08:50;08:52;"when people ask us about that."
08:52;08:53;"Don't know the band at all."
08:53;08:54;"Yeah, they're like, who?"
08:54;08:56;"Maybe we have some shared influences."
08:56;09:01;"(SINGING) I'm something far better, I'm told."
09:01;09:02;"Yeah."
09:05;09:09;"Poppy."
09:12;09:14;"Yeah."
09:16;09:17;"It's pretty tasteful."
09:17;09:18;"Yeah."
09:20;09:21;"Poppy."
09:24;09:25;"Poppies?"
09:25;09:26;"Yeah, it's like some weird-- like,"
09:26;09:28;"this is like a weird history song,"
09:28;09:29;"like about the opium wars."
09:29;09:30;"It must be."
09:30;09:32;"That's very pavement."
09:32;09:34;"That's totally like solo Malcolm S."
09:37;09:40;"You know, one weird thing about me"
09:40;09:43;"is some of the Malcolm S output I'm the most familiar with"
09:43;09:45;"is his first solo album."
09:45;09:47;"Pretty good record."
09:47;09:48;"Yeah."
09:48;09:50;"Because I had an internship--"
09:50;09:51;"OK."
09:51;09:53;"--at Matador Records when I was in high school."
09:53;09:54;"You did?"
09:54;09:56;"I took the train and--"
09:56;09:57;"Really?"
09:57;09:58;"What year was this?"
09:58;10:03;"I think it was summer '01, just before 9/11."
10:03;10:04;"Wow."
10:04;10:06;"And I remember some of the records that had come out"
10:06;10:10;"around that time were like Magui, Stephen Malcolm's solo."
10:10;10:12;"I just remember he had a song on his--"
10:12;10:14;"so like I wasn't that big of a pavement head."
10:14;10:16;"I liked some songs, but then suddenly I"
10:16;10:18;"had a CD of his first solo album."
10:18;10:19;"So I listened to that a bunch."
10:19;10:21;"I just like knew it."
10:21;10:23;"And he had a song called ""Pink India,"""
10:23;10:26;"which I feel like had a little bit of like some history"
10:26;10:28;"lesson vibes, too."
10:28;10:33;"(SINGING) A long time ago in China, I am told."
10:33;10:36;"All I'm saying is, honestly, if you played that for me"
10:36;10:38;"and you didn't tell me what it was,"
10:38;10:40;"I would totally have guessed that might have been something"
10:40;10:44;"that came out on Merge or Matador,"
10:44;10:46;"one of the '90s labels."
10:46;10:47;"I don't know."
10:47;10:49;"There was something-- it's hard to put my finger on."
10:49;10:51;"There was something in like the drumming or--"
10:51;10:52;"The drum sound."
10:52;10:55;"Like there's like they're referencing like kind"
10:55;10:58;"of uncool like pop punk in a way."
10:58;10:59;"Maybe."
10:59;11:02;"That wouldn't pass the sniff test at Matador."
11:02;11:04;"Well, maybe not Matador."
11:04;11:06;"Maybe Merge."
11:06;11:08;"But I don't want to-- here's the thing."
11:08;11:09;"I'm actually very familiar--"
11:09;11:10;"Merge is tight."
11:10;11:13;"I know they're tight, but I'm very familiar with Matador."
11:13;11:14;"Yeah."
11:14;11:15;"And I'm not that familiar with Merge,"
11:15;11:17;"so I might be totally off."
11:17;11:19;"I was very excited to intern at Matador."
11:19;11:21;"I made a bunch of photocopies."
11:21;11:24;"But I was ahead because at that time--"
11:24;11:25;"Bell and Sebastian, right?"
11:25;11:26;"Bell and Sebastian."
11:26;11:28;"I was a big Bell and Sebastian head at the time."
11:28;11:31;"And of course, they had an incredible run in the '90s,"
11:31;11:32;"and they're still killing it."
11:32;11:36;"And then so much, much later--"
11:36;11:37;"well, let's say six years later."
11:37;11:40;"I graduated high school, went to college, started a band."
11:40;11:41;"And then we ended up on XL."
11:41;11:43;"And at that point, XL and Matador"
11:43;11:44;"were under the same roof."
11:44;11:46;"They're still different labels, but they both"
11:46;11:47;"are part of the Beggars group."
11:47;11:50;"And I like started going to meet XL."
11:50;11:51;"And I saw--"
11:51;11:53;"I reintroduced myself to a couple of the Matador people."
11:53;11:55;"I was like, oh, yeah, I used to--"
11:55;11:56;"I entered there."
11:56;11:57;"A couple of them were like, oh, [BLEEP] yeah."
11:57;11:58;"Sounds kind of familiar."
11:58;12:02;"Was there any discussion about Vampire ending up on Matador?"
12:02;12:04;"No, I don't remember ever talking to them."
12:04;12:07;"So I just assume they weren't interested."
12:07;12:08;"And I don't know why."
12:08;12:10;"I guess hindsight's 20/20."
12:10;12:14;"But to me, we just so obviously didn't belong on Matador."
12:14;12:15;"Why is that?"
12:15;12:21;"I mean, I don't really have a sense of Matador circa 2007, 2008."
12:21;12:26;"I don't-- like, I tapped out around on Matador in early twos."
12:26;12:28;"I guess probably the way that we felt,"
12:28;12:32;"and probably they might have felt too, that there was something--"
12:32;12:34;"I think the early Vampire weekend, we were trying"
12:34;12:36;"to extricate ourselves from the--"
12:36;12:37;"'90s?"
12:37;12:39;"From-- yeah, from classic '90s."
12:39;12:41;"Like, at the time--"
12:41;12:43;"you know, and I liked a lot of that stuff,"
12:43;12:46;"but I felt very disconnected from Pavement."
12:46;12:50;"If Pavement was the archetypal '90s Matador band,"
12:50;12:52;"that felt like a totally different tradition"
12:52;12:54;"than what we were doing."
12:54;12:58;"There was also something kind of maybe poppy about us"
12:58;13:01;"that, even though it doesn't make that much sense either,"
13:01;13:03;"XL was always the dream label."
13:03;13:05;"And they also happened to be interested in us,"
13:05;13:06;"so mutually--"
13:06;13:08;"No, yeah, I can see that."
13:08;13:10;"You didn't want to be label mates with Cat Power?"
13:10;13:12;"No, I love Cat Power."
13:12;13:15;"I don't think-- nobody was interested in us at Matador,"
13:15;13:17;"just to be clear."
13:17;13:20;"I think, like, the labels that I remember talking to--"
13:20;13:21;"you know what?"
13:21;13:24;"A lot of them were English, whatever you want to make of that."
13:24;13:26;"A lot of the labels that we talked to a lot"
13:26;13:31;"were like XL, Rough Trade, Bit of Domino."
13:31;13:34;"And sometimes we would talk to their American office,"
13:34;13:38;"but they-- I don't know, there tended to be more of a"
13:38;13:40;"""they got us and we got them"" kind of vibe,"
13:40;13:42;"I think, with some of the English labels."
13:42;13:45;"Got it. So it wasn't like an MC Paul Barman thing."
13:45;13:47;"Wait, was MC Paul Barman on Matador?"
13:47;13:48;"Apparently."
13:48;13:49;"Oh, yeah."
13:49;13:51;"Is Malchmus still on Matador?"
13:51;13:54;"Yes. Yeah, Malchmus and the Jicks"
13:54;13:57;"are still Matador artists as are--"
13:57;13:59;"That's deep. He's like 30 years deep on Matador."
13:59;14:02;"Queens of the Stone Age, you got Yola Tango,"
14:02;14:05;"Kim Gordon, Pavement also still on Matador,"
14:05;14:07;"Interpol."
14:07;14:08;"Oh, really?"
14:08;14:09;"Oh, yeah, Interpol."
14:09;14:10;"Apparently."
14:10;14:11;"Thinking about how Paul started on Matador,"
14:11;14:13;"then went to a major, then came back."
14:13;14:15;"I mean, it's an incredible label."
14:15;14:18;"And you know, the dude who started it,"
14:18;14:21;"he's quoted heavily in ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"""
14:21;14:24;"because he was in high school--"
14:24;14:25;"what's his name? Cosloy."
14:25;14:26;"He was writing--"
14:26;14:27;"Gerard."
14:27;14:32;"Gerard. He had a zine from a young age,"
14:32;14:36;"probably put on Sonic Youth shows."
14:36;14:37;"Who knows?"
14:37;14:39;"Yeah. Speaking of ""Our Band Could Be Your Life,"""
14:39;14:42;"did you get your copy of the Nirvana book?"
14:42;14:44;"I did. Shout out to Michael Azarad."
14:44;14:46;"I'm very excited to dig into it."
14:46;14:48;"I got my copy as well."
14:48;14:51;"It's a tome. It's a serious volume."
14:51;14:52;"Well, that's a big old book."
14:52;14:54;"Yeah. We'll have him on at some point."
14:54;14:55;"Yeah, yeah. Let's read it."
14:55;14:58;"Let's do ""Come as You Are Book Club."""
14:58;15:01;"Azarad should do ""Our Band Could Be Your Life 2,"""
15:01;15:04;"but it's about more like Marcy Playground-type bands."
15:04;15:10;"He did the 12 indie bands that paved the way for Nirvana,"
15:10;15:13;"that connective tissue between the '70s punk"
15:13;15:16;"and the '90s alternative explosion."
15:16;15:17;"Yeah."
15:17;15:19;"I think it'd be cool to do post-Nirvana,"
15:19;15:26;"just the story of 12 bands who had brief careers"
15:26;15:29;"post-Nirvana or who did something kind of interesting,"
15:29;15:36;"but in the kind of weird post-Nirvana major indie whatever."
15:36;15:38;"Right, because ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"" was..."
15:38;15:41;"I think the main criteria was you didn't sign to a major."
15:41;15:45;"People were always like, ""Why is REM not in 'Our Band Could Be Your Life'?"""
15:45;15:47;"They started on a major."
15:47;15:48;"Yeah, you couldn't start on a major."
15:48;15:49;"That was the rule for..."
15:49;15:50;"Yeah, I guess that's right,"
15:50;15:52;"because Sonic Youth and stuff signed to Geffen."
15:52;15:53;"And the replacements."
15:53;15:54;"Of course."
15:54;15:57;"But yeah, it'd be funny to do the '90s version of..."
15:57;16:00;"It has to be bands that started only on majors,"
16:00;16:02;"or they started on majors."
16:02;16:04;"Weezer, Marcy Playground."
16:04;16:05;"Candlebox."
16:05;16:07;"Couldn't be Green Day."
16:07;16:08;"Yeah, can't be Green Day."
16:08;16:10;"A lot of people were asking, ""Why is Green Day not in this book?"""
16:10;16:14;"And also, I think in the same way that ""In Our Band Could Be Your Life,"""
16:14;16:18;"which if any TC heads have never read that book,"
16:18;16:20;"that's a real classic."
16:20;16:24;"In that book, I would say the average TC listener picking it up,"
16:24;16:27;"you're going to know at least 50% of the bands."
16:27;16:29;"Everybody's heard of Sonic Youth."
16:29;16:33;"Definitely heard of Dinosaur Jr. if you listen to this show"
16:33;16:36;"and you're familiar with Jake's taste."
16:36;16:38;"But then you're going to get into Beat Happening."
16:38;16:39;"Sure."
16:39;16:40;"Do you know Beat Happening?"
16:40;16:42;"Seinfeld, do you know Beat Happening?"
16:42;16:43;"No, what is that?"
16:43;16:45;"That's a band that could be your life."
16:45;16:47;"You know who Calvin Johnson is?"
16:47;16:49;"Oh, that rings a bell."
16:49;16:51;"K Records."
16:51;16:52;"Oh, yeah, okay."
16:52;16:56;"It kind of runs the gamut from these kind of household alternative names"
16:56;16:59;"to ones that are well-known within indies,"
16:59;17:03;"Beat Happening, Mission of Burma, that--"
17:03;17:05;"Mission of Burma was one of those where I was like,"
17:05;17:07;"""I do not know this band."""
17:07;17:10;"I remember Tomás from Phoenix was not familiar with Beat Happening."
17:10;17:12;"I remember we were doing a little bit of--"
17:12;17:13;"Were they on the list?"
17:13;17:16;"Yeah, we were doing a '90s rundown, and I was like,"
17:16;17:17;"""Hey, do you like Got It by Voices?"""
17:17;17:19;"And he was like, ""Who?"""
17:19;17:20;"And then, yeah, he was--"
17:20;17:22;"And then I somehow beat Happening came up, and he was like,"
17:22;17:24;"""What's that? I've never heard of that."""
17:24;17:26;"And I was kind of, like, honestly shocked."
17:26;17:27;"Interesting."
17:27;17:29;"Yeah, just didn't cross the pond, I guess."
17:29;17:32;"But I guess in our band could be your life too,"
17:32;17:35;"it's also going to run the gamut from a Weezer,"
17:35;17:37;"kind of more like household name,"
17:37;17:39;"to a Marcy playground where people are like,"
17:39;17:41;"""Wait, who are-- I'm not sure I remember them."""
17:41;17:42;"Then it's like, well, Sex and C--"
17:42;17:44;"Oh, [bleep] yeah, of course I know that song."
17:44;17:46;"I don't know, Candlebox?"
17:46;17:49;"Yeah, or like Third Eye Blind, you know?"
17:49;17:52;"The story of Creed?"
17:52;17:55;"Oh, last chapter, Creed."
17:55;17:57;"Maybe by the time you get to Creed,"
17:57;17:58;"we're kind of like losing the plot."
17:58;18:00;"It should be bands that--"
18:00;18:02;"And also one criterion is that these bands"
18:02;18:06;"were familiar with indie music."
18:06;18:07;"Right."
18:07;18:11;"Like, Scott Staff from Creed, it's very possible"
18:11;18:13;"he's never heard of Pavement in his life."
18:13;18:14;"I would bet."
18:14;18:16;"Rivers Cuomo knows who Pavement is."
18:16;18:17;"For sure."
18:17;18:19;"And also--"
18:19;18:20;"Wozniak knows."
18:20;18:21;"Are the bands in that book,"
18:21;18:22;"are they familiar with the bands from"
18:22;18:24;"Our Band Can Be Your Life?"
18:24;18:25;"You know, Rivers Cuomo definitely knows"
18:25;18:28;"who the replacements in Diner So Junior are."
18:28;18:31;"Scott-- what's his name? Scott Stapp?"
18:31;18:32;"Scott Stapp."
18:32;18:33;"He might know the replacements."
18:33;18:35;"That wouldn't surprise me, but yeah."
18:35;18:36;"Yeah, maybe he would have caught"
18:36;18:38;"the Bastards of Young video on MTV"
18:38;18:41;"when he was growing up."
18:41;18:42;"Or maybe he'd surprise us."
18:42;18:43;"Maybe we're being judgmental,"
18:43;18:45;"and he would just be like,"
18:45;18:47;"""You know, Beat the Happenings"
18:47;18:49;"always put a smile on my face."
18:49;18:51;"My cousin gave me one of their tapes,"
18:51;18:53;"and yeah, you might not think it,"
18:53;18:55;"'cause I definitely, with Creed,"
18:55;18:57;"we're going for more of an anthemic big thing,"
18:57;19:00;"but yeah, that suits them."
19:00;19:01;"What I do suits me,"
19:01;19:04;"and that kind of lo-fi weird s--t,"
19:04;19:06;"that suits them, and I enjoy it."""
19:06;19:09;"You know what, I love all those SST bands."
19:09;19:11;"Minute Man, early Diner So Junior,"
19:11;19:13;"I mean, that stuff's, you know."
19:13;19:14;"I guess Black Flag is the one that,"
19:14;19:16;"who knows, maybe Scott Stapp is like,"
19:16;19:17;"""Oh yeah, f--king love Black Flag."""
19:17;19:19;"Oh, for sure, I could totally see that."
19:19;19:21;"I just want to throw out one more."
19:21;19:22;"Can we throw out Track 2"
19:22;19:24;"on the Marcy Playground record?"
19:24;19:26;"Have you heard this record before?"
19:26;19:28;"I don't think so."
19:28;19:30;"But I did always like Sex and Candy."
19:30;19:32;"Okay, guys, egg on my face,"
19:32;19:34;"turns out Track 2 is Sex and Candy."
19:34;19:35;"Let's go to Track 3."
19:35;19:37;"I just love how quiet the chorus is,"
19:37;19:39;"Sex and Candy, and everything drops out."
19:39;19:44;"electric guitar plays"
19:44;19:51;"Ancient walls of flowers"
19:51;19:55;"Tumbling down"
19:55;19:57;"Black cat, turtles,"
19:57;20:01;"And a smiling clown"
20:01;20:03;"I like to keep them"
20:03;20:07;"In a jar beside"
20:08;20:13;"Just enough to mess my mind inside"
20:13;20:15;"But I never heard you"
20:15;20:19;"Calling from the sun"
20:19;20:21;"Did you ever care"
20:21;20:23;"To shoot your silver gun?"
20:23;20:24;"I'm not mad at this."
20:24;20:25;"No, this is chill."
20:25;20:26;"Yeah."
20:26;20:28;"No, I never heard you"
20:28;20:32;"Calling from the moon"
20:32;20:33;"Did you ever care"
20:33;20:37;"To sing your free love to me?"
20:37;20:39;"Wow, this guy, John Wozniak,"
20:39;20:41;"went to Evergreen State College,"
20:41;20:43;"which is in Olympia, Washington."
20:43;20:45;"Oh, so he knows Beat Happening."
20:45;20:46;"In the mid '90s,"
20:46;20:48;"and then he went for two years,"
20:48;20:51;"and then he moved to New York."
20:51;20:53;"Yeah, I mean, Evergreen State College"
20:53;20:55;"is where, like, I think, like,"
20:55;20:57;"Cary Brownstein went there, and like..."
20:57;20:58;"Yeah, and Calvin Johns,"
20:58;21:00;"and Kurt was hanging out in Olympia."
21:00;21:01;"He didn't go there."
21:01;21:03;"He was hanging out in Olympia."
21:03;21:04;"But I never heard you"
21:04;21:06;"Were you guys like me in that you thought"
21:06;21:09;"the name was--the name Marcy Playground"
21:09;21:13;"was after the Brooklyn Marcy Projects?"
21:13;21:15;"Well, it occurred to me, yeah,"
21:15;21:18;"but I never really thought about it beyond that."
21:18;21:19;"But it's actually named after"
21:19;21:23;"the Marcy Open Grade School in Minneapolis."
21:23;21:26;"Oh, 'cause it's--is he from Minneapolis?"
21:26;21:28;"Uh, yeah."
21:28;21:30;"Yeah."
21:30;21:31;"Well, let's check out the solo."
21:31;21:34;"Also, this band is still going."
21:34;21:37;"Years active, '94 to present."
21:37;21:46;"If I pulled up on a new band,"
21:46;21:48;"and they're playing this song live..."
21:48;21:52;"Ooh, yeah, I would sign them."
21:52;21:54;"Nice."
21:54;21:57;"No, I never heard you calling"
21:57;22:00;"From the sun"
22:00;22:01;"Did you ever care"
22:01;22:04;"To shoot your silver gun"
22:04;22:06;"Come on, kids, you like--"
22:06;22:07;"you listen to Mac DeMarco,"
22:07;22:09;"but you can't give this a chance?"
22:09;22:10;"What?"
22:10;22:12;"Around 2000, I did a couple tours"
22:12;22:13;"with Calvin Johnson."
22:13;22:14;"Oh, when you were in--"
22:14;22:15;"playing with Wolf Turner?"
22:15;22:18;"Yeah, I used to know Calvin pretty well."
22:18;22:20;"He had a band called Dub Narcotic."
22:20;22:21;"Oh, what did they sound like?"
22:21;22:22;"Dub Narcotic Sound System."
22:22;22:23;"Oh."
22:23;22:24;"Um, it was kind of like--"
22:24;22:25;"man, throw in some Dub Narcotic."
22:25;22:26;"It was kind of like--"
22:26;22:27;"Sounded like beat happening?"
22:27;22:29;"Kind of like instrumental funk,"
22:29;22:30;"and then Calvin doing, like--"
22:30;22:31;"His low voice."
22:31;22:32;"No, it didn't sound like beat happening at all."
22:32;22:34;"It was like-- it was funky."
22:34;22:36;"At least that's my recollection."
22:36;22:37;"I haven't heard it in years."
22:37;22:39;"And then Calvin doing his weird kind of Calvin--"
22:39;22:40;"Innocent, oh, dear."
22:40;22:44;"Yeah, kind of David Byrne kind of vibe."
22:44;22:45;"But yeah, I was in Wolf Kernel."
22:45;22:47;"We did a few tours."
22:47;22:50;"It was Wolf Kernel, The Microphones."
22:50;22:51;"Hmm."
22:51;22:53;"It's Dub Narcotic Sound System."
22:56;23:04;"OK, maybe funk's the wrong word."
23:04;23:06;"No, but yeah, 90s--"
23:06;23:07;"A little bit of the beat."
23:07;23:08;"--breakbeat plus indie."
23:08;23:09;"Yeah."
23:11;23:12;"Melodica."
23:19;23:39;"Yeah, I haven't seen Calvin in years, but he's a cool dude."
23:39;23:41;"He had so many crazy stories."
23:41;23:43;"He has a good vibe."
23:43;23:44;"Sounds pretty fresh."
23:44;23:45;"Yeah, I'm used to those Calvin--"
23:45;23:46;"Here we go."
23:46;23:47;"Oh, my god."
23:47;23:49;"Wait, what?"
23:49;23:50;"I hear the dub."
23:50;23:53;"You know, I don't think I've ever heard a dub narcotic recording."
23:53;23:57;"I've only just saw them live like 10 or 15 times."
23:57;23:58;"Maybe it was different."
23:58;24:01;"Wait, why don't we just throw on one beat happening song for Seinfeld"
24:01;24:03;"and for the listeners?"
24:03;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:06;"I mean, the classic is Indian Summer."
24:06;24:08;"(SINGING) Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:08;24:09;"Yeah, throw it on."
24:10;24:12;"Yeah, so this is like mid '80s."
24:16;24:23;"Breakfast in cemetery, boy tasting wild cherry,"
24:23;24:30;"touch girl, apple blossom, just a boy playing possum."
24:30;24:33;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:33;24:37;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:37;24:40;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:43;24:47;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:47;24:51;"What is that cheerful sound?"
24:51;24:54;"Rain falling on the ground."
24:54;24:58;"I mean, classic, kind of like the first tree band."
24:58;25:01;"Buckle up, we're wayward bound."
25:01;25:03;"Well, it's kind of like owning--"
25:03;25:04;"That's a good--"
25:04;25:05;"--with like a kind of--"
25:05;25:06;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
25:06;25:07;"--owning the kind of cutesiness."
25:07;25:09;"I mean, Jonathan Richman, maybe, or you know--"
25:09;25:11;"Oh, yeah, right."
25:11;25:12;"That makes sense."
25:12;25:14;"Yeah, I wouldn't call them velvets, twee,"
25:14;25:16;"but they flirt with it occasionally."
25:16;25:20;"But then, yeah, Jonathan Richman seems like the real grandfather."
25:20;25:21;"Yeah."
25:25;25:29;"I touch your hem, you say."
25:29;25:32;"Let's stroll down Martin Way."
25:32;25:36;"Pick plums, abandoned farm."
25:36;25:39;"Who let norms come to harm?"
25:39;25:43;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
25:43;25:46;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
25:49;25:53;"Then go our separate ways."
25:53;25:56;"Cover me with rain."
25:56;26:00;"Walk me down the lane."
26:00;26:03;"I'll drink from your drain."
26:03;26:05;"We will never change."
26:05;26:07;"It's always like very simple."
26:07;26:08;"No matter what they raise."
26:08;26:09;"Yeah, this sounds awesome."
26:09;26:10;"I haven't heard this in years."
26:10;26:13;"We'll come back for Indian Summer."
26:13;26:17;"We'll come back for Indian Summer."
26:17;26:20;"We'll come back for Indian Summer."
26:20;26:22;"And go our separate ways."
26:22;26:30;"Good vibe."
26:30;26:34;"All right, so should we keep going with this '80s rock?"
26:34;26:35;"Absolutely."
26:35;26:37;"We're doing '80s rock today."
26:37;26:39;"We're in the mid '80s."
26:39;26:40;"We're in the mid '80s."
26:40;26:43;"Maybe let's go a few years earlier to the early '80s."
26:43;26:47;"What's the adjective instead of the tasteful palate?"
26:47;26:51;"What kind of palate is '80s rock, Jake?"
26:51;26:56;"Well, I would say that '80s rock beat happening was pretty tasteful."
26:56;26:57;"True, yeah."
26:57;26:59;"I think the stuff we're about to get into is--"
26:59;27:01;"Are we going to get into Jake Isles?"
27:01;27:02;"I was saying Jake Isles."
27:02;27:03;"Yeah, yeah, we're going to get into little Jake Isles."
27:03;27:07;"I imagine, Jake, that when you think of '80s rock, you would call it--"
27:07;27:11;"You would think of it as the harsh palate of the 1980s."
27:11;27:12;"Yeah."
27:12;27:18;"Like, if you say '80s rock, I think of like kind of Def Leppard, Brian Adams."
27:18;27:21;"Stuff with a real kind of glossy sheen to it."
27:21;27:22;"Gated snare drums."
27:22;27:23;"Right, right."
27:23;27:29;"I go right to those Peter Gabriel, those loud-ass snares."
27:29;27:32;"Those synthetic-sounding snares."
27:32;27:38;"I would say it's the crunch-y brutality of the '80s palate."
27:38;27:40;"I'm not an '80s guy, as has been documented."
27:40;27:41;"He's not an '80s guy."
27:41;27:46;"I think there's a lot of amazing '80s music, but there are a lot of '80s recordings"
27:46;27:52;"that are both big and kind of thin at the same time."
27:52;27:55;"Yeah, they can be kind of harsh, mid-rangey."
27:55;27:59;"My theory is that if you were a band in the '70s and you were mediocre,"
27:59;28:02;"you could still make a pretty decent-sounding record."
28:02;28:09;"And in the '80s, you had to be like a genius to make a good-sounding record."
28:09;28:11;"That goes to my Prince theory."
28:11;28:13;"Why I don't like Prince."
28:13;28:17;"If he had made records in the '70s, I would have loved it."
28:17;28:19;"Which he did, too."
28:19;28:20;"Late '70s, yeah."
28:20;28:24;"I'm talking prime period, '72, '73."
28:24;28:25;"Right."
28:25;28:26;"Anyway."
28:26;28:27;"Don't get it twisted."
28:27;28:30;"Different years are more tasteful than others within the 1970s."
28:30;28:31;"Oh, yeah."
28:31;28:32;"Definitely."
28:32;28:37;"I mean, it's the first kind of three years of the '70s that are really the height of"
28:37;28:40;"Western culture."
28:40;28:42;"I mean, you're not wrong."
28:42;28:45;"Didn't Apple make a TV series in 1971?"
28:45;28:46;"Oh, right."
28:46;28:48;"Was that in 2021, like the 50th?"
28:48;28:49;"Yeah."
28:49;28:50;"I think so."
28:50;28:53;"Just all the amazing music that came out in '71?"
28:53;28:54;"Right."
28:54;28:56;"I consider that the most tasteful year ever."
28:56;28:58;"Is that how they phrased it?"
28:58;28:59;"I don't know."
28:59;29:00;"I didn't see it."
29:00;29:03;"People told me it was good, but clearly they picked 1971 for a reason."
29:03;29:07;"And so, anyway, the band we're about to talk about, J. Giles Band."
29:07;29:10;"We've been getting a lot of phone calls and emails, people saying, ""How come you guys"
29:10;29:13;"never talk about Giles Band?"""
29:13;29:14;"It's funny."
29:14;29:15;"JGB."
29:15;29:16;"Yeah."
29:16;29:20;"We've talked more about the other JGB, Jerry Garcia Band, than we've talked about J. Giles."
29:20;29:23;"And this is a show where we cover rock music a lot."
29:23;29:26;"So, it's about time we rectified that."
29:26;29:32;"I heard a song recently that made me realize I actually don't know that much about J. Giles"
29:32;29:34;"and made me go a little deeper."
29:34;29:39;"And then I sent it to you, Jay, because I wondered, you know, do you know some of their"
29:39;29:40;"'70s stuff?"
29:40;29:44;"And this is a good song called ""Must've Got Lost."""
29:44;29:45;"This is from '74."
29:45;29:49;"And then I realized, you know, it has that kind of like, I don't know how you describe"
29:49;29:50;"this kind of music."
29:50;29:54;"East coast, a little bit Bruce Springsteen, piano-y, fun."
29:54;29:55;"Like a little bit..."
29:55;29:56;"Kind of boogies."
29:56;29:57;"Kind of boogie?"
29:57;29:59;"Yeah, kind of boogies."
29:59;30:00;"Yeah, kind of boogies."
30:00;30:04;"It's like, feel good, feel good rock."
30:04;30:13;"Not much edge."
30:13;30:14;"Yeah."
30:14;30:15;"Kind of like Dewey Brothers or something."
30:15;30:19;"But something about it, like, I don't know why, it sounds really east coast to me."
30:20;30:23;"Not to see you, other one."
30:23;30:27;"Well, they're from Worcester, Mass."
30:27;30:28;"They're from Mass."
30:28;30:31;"I bet they're probably recording in New York, if I had to guess."
30:31;30:34;"I'll let you walk on by."
30:34;30:39;"I refuse the love you had for me."
30:39;30:42;"I don't know, it's got an east coast attitude."
30:42;30:43;"But here we go."
30:43;30:45;"I must've got lost."
30:45;30:46;"I must've got lost."
30:46;30:49;"Yeah, the first record was recorded in New York."

59:20;59:22;"a little bit about this,"
59:22;59:24;"'cause the book Cherry on Top"
59:24;59:29;"is about the recording of Bobby's biggest album,"
59:29;59:32;"and he records it in Joshua Tree in 1978."
59:32;59:34;"Obviously, this is all fictitious, and it's--"
59:34;59:37;"- It's also written from the point of view"
59:37;59:39;"of a 74-year-old Bobby Bird"
59:39;59:42;"looking back at-- - First person."
59:42;59:45;"- Yeah, it's first person, but it's this character"
59:45;59:47;"looking back 40 years prior."
59:47;59:49;"So, I don't know, let's call Carson."
59:49;59:51;"Let's get into the Bobby Bird universe."
59:51;59:52;"- Yeah."
59:52;59:56;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
59:56;59:59;"[beeping]"
59:59;01:00:02;"[Beeping]"
01:00:02;01:00:06;"- What's up, dude?"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- It's not much. How you doing?"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"- Not bad."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"- Thanks for having me on to talk about the new book."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"I really appreciate it."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"- Of course, yeah, I was just setting it up a little."
01:00:15;01:00:18;"I said it's written from the point of view"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"of Bobby Bird when he was in his 70s"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"looking back at his life when he was in his 30s."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Is that right?"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"- Yeah, I think--yeah, definitely."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"He's 70-something in the book."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"Here, I have a copy right here."
01:00:30;01:00:34;"- He's recording the album in Joshua Tree, 1978,"
01:00:34;01:00:37;"which obviously, that immediately piqued my interest."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"I was like, okay, Joshua Tree, 1978."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"I immediately thought--I mean, let's--"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"maybe you could describe Bobby Bird to the audience"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"because if you say '70s Joshua Tree,"
01:00:49;01:00:54;"I think of the Eagles doing their first record cover shoot"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"in Joshua Tree in the early '70s,"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"and then, of course, Grand Parson spending time there"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"and then dying there in 1970."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"- Yeah."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- And, you know, the whole thing with his body."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"So this is a few years later."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"- Yeah, but he's wearing nudie suits out there,"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"so there's definitely the Parsons influence."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"I think originally I wanted to write a book"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"about an artist recording an album"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"who owed his label an album"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"and just was spending all of his time looking for UFOs,"
01:01:20;01:01:23;"which I think is like the Grand Parson story out there"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"or at least a version of it that I've heard."
01:01:25;01:01:29;"And then that didn't have a plot at all or a story,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"so that kind of faded away,"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"and then it became this book, ""Cherry on Top."""
01:01:34;01:01:40;"But, yeah, Bobby Bird was born in '45."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"So, yeah, in the '70s--late '70s, like '32."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- That's the classic year"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"if you're a '60s and '70s rock star to be born."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- '45, yeah."
01:01:49;01:01:52;"- Well, yeah, some of them are a little bit earlier."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"They're all born between--yeah, it depends,"
01:01:54;01:02:01;"but the people born between '41 and '49,"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"that's just about everybody."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"- Yeah, you got to be a boomer."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"- Early boomer."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"- Yeah, 'cause Tom Petty was a little older--"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"- He was born in 1950,"
01:02:13;01:02:17;"so he's just barely out of the '40s."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- Yeah."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I remember reading that scene in ""The Five"""
01:02:20;01:02:22;"and being like, ""Wait, what?"""
01:02:22;01:02:24;"- Yeah, 'cause I think Bruce is like 49,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"and then Tom--but they're the young guns,"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"but yeah, Dylan, Jerry, the Beatles, the Stones."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- The Beatles, yeah."
01:02:32;01:02:36;"- Those guys are all 41 to 45, probably."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"- Was Dylan 43?"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"- Two."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"- Maybe 41."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- He's not two, because my dad is,"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"and I remember--I think he's 43,"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"'cause I remember my dad being obsessed with Dylan"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"and then me once being like,"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"""Oh, he was younger than you."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"That's kind of cool."""
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- Okay, yeah, maybe 43."
01:02:54;01:03:04;"- ♪ Brass buttons, green silks, and silver shoes ♪"
01:03:04;01:03:15;"♪ Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues ♪"
01:03:15;01:03:29;"♪ And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair ♪"
01:03:29;01:03:37;"♪ Brass buttons, green silks, and silver shoes ♪"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"- So you've done all sorts of writing."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"You've written books."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"You've written on a lot of great TV shows."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"You major on TV shows."
01:03:44;01:03:49;"Great movie with Hannah Fidel, Jake's wife, ""Long Dumb Road."""
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Did you know you wanted to write a book,"
01:03:51;01:03:54;"or did the character Bobby Bird reach out and touch you"
01:03:54;01:03:57;"and tell you which medium he belonged in?"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"- Well, you know, the funny thing is it was a cartoon first."
01:04:00;01:04:05;"I did this back when there were DVDs."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"Do you remember this DVD that Mick Sweeney's put out"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"called ""Wolfin"" by any chance?"
01:04:10;01:04:11;"- I've heard of it, yeah."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Spelled like ""dolphin"" with--"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- Yeah."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"- ""W-H,"" yeah."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"- They were publishing a lot of my cartoons at the time,"
01:04:18;01:04:22;"and I had this idea to do a nude man covered in tattoos."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"You navigate the tattoos,"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"and he would tell you the story of each tattoo."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"And so I made that."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"It was called ""The Devil in Denim,"""
01:04:30;01:04:31;"and it starred Bobby Bird,"
01:04:31;01:04:35;"and these little vignettes were my way into knowing him."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"And then funnily enough,"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"like I had the phone number of an executive"
01:04:40;01:04:43;"at Comedy Central from some--"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"like when I was like really young,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"I pitched them something that they hated,"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"and I just called the number."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"The funny thing is the woman that I knew there,"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"her name was Angela Howard."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"She didn't work there anymore,"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"but the number was still some new executive."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"So I explained who I was,"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"and I told him I made these cartoons"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"with this old rock star,"
01:05:03;01:05:06;"and he said, ""Well, write some longer scripts."""
01:05:06;01:05:07;"And then I started writing the scripts,"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"and they turned into a book,"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"and I never even called that dude back"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"because it was just like they accumulated quickly,"
01:05:14;01:05:17;"and then I made this book called ""Saguaro,"""
01:05:17;01:05:19;"and that's Bobby Bird's life story."
01:05:19;01:05:24;"So that was a long time ago, like 2005."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"And I've been working with that character now"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"for almost 20 years,"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"so he's like so entirely in my bones"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"that it's very easy to make work with him,"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"which can be a good thing and a bad thing,"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"but when I'm like done--"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"when we're trying to work outside my comfort zone,"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"I always come back and do some Bobby Bird stuff, you know?"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"How old are you, Carson?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"43."
01:05:45;01:05:49;"What do you think it is about this era?"
01:05:49;01:05:50;"I'm asking you specifically,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"although I think it's true for all of us."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"What is it about this era that you feel so drawn to?"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"These guys from a different generation,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"the music of the '70s."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"What is it that you think draws you in so much?"
01:06:02;01:06:05;"I think it's sort of that fantasy of--"
01:06:05;01:06:09;"well, for me, just the fantasy of being a rock star"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"from that era specifically,"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"because it's so romantic, right?"
01:06:13;01:06:16;"I mean, I think we've all romanticized it."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Ezra, I'm assuming when you were first getting into music,"
01:06:18;01:06:22;"you were fantasizing about having that lifestyle, right?"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"Like just going on the road"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"and maybe not getting sick on drugs,"
01:06:27;01:06:32;"but other than that."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Well, yeah, there were--"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"I think as I've gotten older,"
01:06:35;01:06:38;"I've found these kind of characters"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"a little more interesting."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Yeah, like probably when I was young,"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"I was interested in the punk bands and stuff,"
01:06:44;01:06:49;"but a kind of country rock guy in Southern California,"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"I had to grow into that interest."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Now I'm very interested."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"I feel like that--"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"Yeah, I feel like you got interested in that"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"when we were doing this show."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"When we started doing Time Crisis,"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"country rock from SoCal in the '70s"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"was not on the menu for Ezra."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"Well, I always liked Flying Burrito Brothers."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I randomly had their record"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"that I got at a thrift store in high school,"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"so I was always like, ""Oh, this is cool."""
01:07:13;01:07:15;"But I mean, honestly, Jake,"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"even way before Time Crisis,"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"when we first became friends,"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"you were the first person I met"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"who was passionate about the Eagles, for instance."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Right."
01:07:24;01:07:29;"So even that was probably a bit of a reframing for me."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"And I guess, Carson, what is it about--"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"I know what you mean."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Rock history, very enticing,"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"the crazy lifestyles,"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"the larger-than-life personalities."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Zoom in a little more specifically,"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"1970s Southern California."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"What's appealing about that to you versus--"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"Well, Bobby Bird's actually from Phoenix."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"He's from my hometown,"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"which is, to me, just funny"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"because artists don't usually come from Phoenix,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"other than Spielberg, I guess."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"And so, I mean, for me,"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"I think in a lot of ways, too,"
01:08:03;01:08:06;"it was just like, I'm not really a musician."
01:08:06;01:08:10;"I play guitar, but back then I didn't at all."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"I remember at one point,"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"I think I called his guitar a five-string."
01:08:13;01:08:16;"That's how little I knew about music"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"when I wrote the book."
01:08:18;01:08:23;"And so it was like a way to write about art without--"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"because nobody--I'm kind of anti--"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"actually, I'm fully anti the writer as the protagonist."
01:08:29;01:08:31;"I don't like that."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"It just seems like a cop-out."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"And so I was like, well, how can I write about"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"the creative process and all that stuff"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"but make it completely alien to me"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"and also in a realm where I worship it"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"and it still has--"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"you get too familiar with a god--"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"I mean, with the art,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"and then the practitioners of it"
01:08:50;01:08:53;"can kind of lose that god-like glow."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"But because I didn't even know,"
01:08:55;01:08:59;"like, how to structure a song in any way, shape, or form,"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"songwriters and performers--music performers--"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"were still like gods to me."
01:09:03;01:09:07;"So it felt like, okay, this guy's sort of like a god also."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"Like, I really admire him."
01:09:09;01:09:12;"And then I could also make fun of him"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"because that's sort of my comedy rule."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"Make fun of stuff you admire,"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"not fun of stuff you hate"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"because then you start to get too mean."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Right."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"That's an interesting alternative take"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"when people talk about comedy shouldn't punch down."
01:09:27;01:09:31;"But to even look at comedy through that lens,"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"you have to have a pretty strong viewpoint"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"of who's up, who's down."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"You have to have, like--you have to understand that."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"So what you said actually takes all the guesswork out."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Yeah."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Rather than having to go to everybody's--"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"""Was that punching up or punching down?"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"Is that person above me or below me?"""
01:09:46;01:09:49;"Just say, ""If you hate it, don't get nasty."""
01:09:49;01:09:50;"If you like it--"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Yeah, that's like--"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Like in the first--in ""Sawaro,"" he--"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"this is a spoiler, but in ""Sawaro,"" he tries to--"
01:09:56;01:09:59;"he meets Dylan in a bar in New York,"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"and he tries to have a conversation with him,"
01:10:02;01:10:06;"and Dylan gives him some of that early Dylan edge."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"And so Bobby Bird knocks him out."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"And if I'd have made that--"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"And then he feels really bad about it"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"because he realizes how much better of a songwriter"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"this guy is than him."
01:10:17;01:10:20;"And if I'd made that--"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"Like, I think that chapter would suck."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"You know what I mean?"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"It's just been like, ""And then he punched out a Ted Nugent."""
01:10:27;01:10:29;"And we'd all cheer."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Right."

01:11:03;01:11:05;"You were born and raised in Phoenix?"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Yeah, unfortunately."
01:11:06;01:11:11;"I lived there 22 years, so I'm looking forward to, like,"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"next year where half my life is Phoenix-free."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"You've lived in L.A. for a long time."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"21 years, almost 22, yeah."
01:11:18;01:11:22;"You hate Phoenix, but you like the rough Southwest,"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Joshua Tree somewhere in between."
01:11:24;01:11:28;"Yeah, I like everything in Arizona except for Phoenix."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"And actually, Phoenix was cool through the '80s."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"It was like a community of desert rats."
01:11:33;01:11:37;"And then the Midwesterners, who just wanted cheap property,"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"moved there."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"So it wasn't the interesting Midwesterners."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"It was, like, people who were like,"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"""Oh, it's cheaper there? Let's go."""
01:11:43;01:11:45;"And then I think this happened--"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"I only grew up in one town,"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"but it seemed like in the '90s it happened everywhere"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"where everything became, like, Bookstar, TGI Fridays, Chili's."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"I'm sure so many cities lost their character,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"but Phoenix definitely did."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"But before that, just people--"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"people wanting to move somewhere warm and cheap,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"kind of messing up the vibe."
01:12:05;01:12:09;"How would you describe that '80s and earlier Phoenix vibe?"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"What is, like, the true desert rat energy?"
01:12:12;01:12:17;"I just remember going to, like, dark, narrow Mexican restaurants"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"and eating in the back of them with my dad and brother."
01:12:20;01:12:24;"And I just remember large-- a lot of empty lots."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"You know, like, on the corner of my neighborhood,"
01:12:27;01:12:31;"there was an empty lot that had a bright orange,"
01:12:31;01:12:36;"old-timey carriage in it that was called Graham's Fruit Stand."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"And you could go there and get, like, shakes and smoothies."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"I don't think they were called smoothies, though."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"They were called, like, fruit shakes."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"And they sold dates."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"And now that's condos."
01:12:46;01:12:50;"So all that stuff is gone."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"It's crazy how much it's gone."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Like, I try to go to Mexican restaurants"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"that me and my dad went to, like, a decade ago,"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"and even those are gone."
01:12:58;01:13:03;"And now they all have what I call--as a derogatory term,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"they're all sugar skull Mexican restaurants"
01:13:05;01:13:09;"with, like, big emblems of sugar skulls on the front."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"That, to me, is a sign of, like,"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"you're not getting the real [bleep]"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Oh, wait, what's a sugar skull?"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"A sugar skull is, like, a skull made of sugar."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"They decorate with, like, loop-de-loops"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"and floral kind of stuff."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Oh, yeah, sure."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"It's kind of like a Dia de los Muertos."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Yeah, that's exactly what it is."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Oh, it's like Disney's Coco."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"Yeah, exactly."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Right. It's very Disney's Coco."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"You know what's funny, Carson?"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"I went to a great Mexican restaurant"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"with your dad earlier this year."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Was it a Morisco's one?"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"I don't remember,"
01:13:39;01:13:42;"but I was in Phoenix in, like, March of this year."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"I went there precisely for the reasons"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"that Carson hates Phoenix."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"I was there to photograph, you know,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Cheesecake Factory and Verizon stores"
01:13:50;01:13:53;"around greater Phoenix."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"And then Carson's dad, Ed Mouw,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"is a renowned Arizona landscape painter."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"So we had things to talk about."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Gradients and whatnot."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Yep. Painting."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"Sky gradients."
01:14:07;01:14:11;"He did teach me how to do those when I was, like, 17."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"Yeah, no, your dad's studio is amazing."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"It was a real, like, repository"
01:14:16;01:14:19;"of, like, old Arizona ephemera and art."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"He turned me into a couple, like,"
01:14:21;01:14:24;"early 20th century watercolorists that lived there."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Jimmy Swinerton."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"Yeah, and Gunnar Wydfros,"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"who was a German man"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"that lived in Arizona in the early 20th century."
01:14:35;01:14:38;"There was a lot of German artists"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"that moved to the Southwest"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"right around the turn of the century"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"and did amazing watercolor and woodblock work."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"Anyway, I felt..."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"Yeah, I've seen my dad's studio has retained"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"the '80s Phoenix vibe."
01:14:52;01:14:56;"No, I felt the weird old Arizona energy"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"hanging out with your dad."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"What towns do you think have held on"
01:14:59;01:15:02;"to that weird old Arizona energy the most?"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"Bisbee?"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"I've always heard about Bisbee."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"That sounds funky."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Bisbee's funky."
01:15:08;01:15:11;"I mean, really, anywhere outside of Phoenix."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Tucson?"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Tucson's great. I love Tucson."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"Too hot to move there,"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"but if it was, like, 20 degrees cooler,"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"I'd be there right now."
01:15:19;01:15:22;"But it's cooler than Phoenix."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Way cooler, 'cause it doesn't have the..."
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Well, it's a little further..."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Well, I don't know if that makes it cooler,"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"being further south,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"but I do know that the lack of, like,"
01:15:31;01:15:35;"endless concrete and asphalt keeps it cooler."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"I think it's higher elevation, too."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"I mean, on my trip there,"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I went to Phoenix, and then I went to Tucson,"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"and then there was, like, a crazy snowstorm"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"that happened in Tucson."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Oh, wow."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"The night I was there."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"And then the next day,"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"I went with my buddy down to this"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"huge shopping center"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"that was at the base of these mountains,"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"and I got the most insane photographs"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"of, like, a red lobster"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"with, like, snowy mountains behind it."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"And, yeah, Tucson just felt like"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"a completely different, like, ecosystem"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"than Phoenix."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"It is, yeah."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"It's retained the desert funk."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Hardcore."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"And I think they have also..."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"What's cool there is they have a giant telescope,"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"so there's even laws against lights,"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"so it's really dark at night."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"Oh."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"So, Carson, what do you think Bobby Bird"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"would have thought of the Eagles?"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"I can't get a handle on what"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"Bobby Bird actually sounds like."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Well, Bobby Bird is..."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"The joke on the back cover of Saguaro"
01:16:31;01:16:34;"is he's the Bob right between Dylan and Seager."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"So that's what I imagine him like."
01:16:36;01:16:40;"Moments of greatness, but a lot of corn."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"I don't know how you feel about Seager,"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"but I feel like he's pretty corny."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"I love Bob Seager."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"In fact, Ezra and I saw him at the forum"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"on his farewell tour."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"He's got a lot of, like, kind of boogie,"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"kind of chuglin' rock songs that I could..."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"But his ballads are, like, bar none."
01:16:57;01:17:00;"I think that's probably where Bobby Bird lives"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"in that world, where it's, like, a lot of..."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I mean, he would say as much that, like,"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"a lot of his work is just meeting contract requirements."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Like, he owes an album, so he makes an album."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"They're uninspired."
01:17:10;01:17:13;"He has, like, 45 songs about storms."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"That's, like, his go-to."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"He's always writing about monsoons and stuff."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"So, yeah, he was, like, Z making hits."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"A pretty successful artist,"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"but not a very good artist."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"Successful, but I think the good songs are good,"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"and he knows when the bad songs are bad."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"And I think... He's, like, a very haunted man,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"and that's one of the things that haunts him,"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"is all the pabulum he's passed off over the years."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"But he's always trying to find his way back to that place,"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"that, like, original spot of inspiration."
01:17:41;01:17:45;"We actually recorded a couple of his songs"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"with... for the audio book of Cherry on Top,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"which came out before the book,"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"like, a couple years ago with Audible."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Who published Cherry on Top?"
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Oh, Secret Headquarters."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Yeah, that comic shop."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"A local... Oh, yeah."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"That comic shop."
01:18:01;01:18:06;"I sent Matt some YouTube links to the songs."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Oh, yeah, I'll throw one on. I'd love to hear that."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Yeah, throw it on."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"So do you feel like you..."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"So you work with Jonathan Rado?"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"Yeah, yeah."
01:18:14;01:18:15;"He and I..."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"He is great."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"And I... It's funny,"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"'cause he did it for me dirt cheap,"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"and we actually recorded an album together"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"as a band called Castle."
01:18:25;01:18:29;"C-A-S-L."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Yeah, Castle's dope."
01:18:30;01:18:34;"[playing ""Castle""]"
01:18:34;01:18:40;"This is the titular track from Cherry on Top."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"Is this the hit he writes?"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"This is the one that he can stand on,"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"that he's happy with,"
01:18:46;01:18:49;"and that he battles his way along here."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"[playing ""Castle""]"
01:18:52;01:18:57;"What the heck is wrong with my face"
01:18:57;01:19:01;"Can't believe she came back to my place"
01:19:01;01:19:04;"I took off on the dinner"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"She slid off on the lace"
01:19:07;01:19:12;"What the heck is wrong with my face"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Then she took my heart"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Then she took my heart"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"Kept blood dripping down my cherry on top"
01:19:18;01:19:19;"Is that you singing, of course?"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"That's me and Rado, yeah."
01:19:21;01:19:25;"Blood dripping down my cherry on top"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"So you get the idea."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"[laughs]"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"I'm digging it."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Yeah, sounds great."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Yeah, Rado was perfect for it,"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"'cause he can emulate that '70s sound,"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"like, you know."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"And it was funny,"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"the album we made together,"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"I showed up and I was like,"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"as if anyone would give a sh*t,"
01:19:46;01:19:49;"I was like, ""Let's record the album in two days,"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"so that'll be the legend of the album."""
01:19:51;01:19:54;"And he had all this brand-new equipment,"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"and he was like, ""Okay, we'll do it."""
01:19:57;01:20:00;"'Cause I think at the time he was 24,"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"and he was like, you know,"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"he's like a bandy little fella,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"and he's just running around the studio"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"with spaghetti worth of cords"
01:20:07;01:20:10;"all over his shoulders and plugging things in."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"And I didn't know what he was doing"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"like 90% of the time,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"and we actually got the album done in two days."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"And he was learning how to use all that equipment"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"at the time, too, his new stuff."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"So it sounds a little gritty,"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"and the vocals are kind of hard to make out,"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"but we got it done."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"There's a Castle song that I think about a lot,"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"the one that's like,"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"and maybe it could have been a Bobby Byrd song,"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"the one that's like,"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"""You say you don't like Mexicans,"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"but you like Mexican food."""
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Yeah, yeah."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"♪ I saw the devil last night ♪"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Yeah, that's--"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"Do you hear it?"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"It's C-A-S apostrophe L."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"Yeah, which I didn't, it's funny,"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"I didn't realize it after,"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"until I named it,"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"that it was an abbreviation of my name."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"And so it was kind of a,"

01:24:18;01:24:19;"What should we do?"

01:24:31;01:24:32;"Yeah, that sounds great."
01:24:32;01:24:35;"So, we asked you to pick a year."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"We're going to compare the top hits"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"right now on Apple Music"

01:24:41;01:24:43;"this week in a certain year."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"And you picked 1968."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"I did that?"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Yeah, remember?"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Yeah, you did."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"You said Bobby Byrd's first solo album"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"was 1968."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Oh, cool, cool."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"I didn't know."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Yeah."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Maybe it wasn't clear why I was asking you that."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"No, I had no idea."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Oh, okay. Oh, I see."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"Jake asked you what year his first solo album was."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"Why? Because he was in a band before?"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"He was in like a Buffalo Springfield situation?"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"No, he's always just been Bobby Byrd."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"Oh, he's always just been solo."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"But that tracks to me."
01:25:13;01:25:16;"His first album was 1968."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Yeah."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"I like that."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"Definitely."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"The number five song this week in 1968,"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"the year of Bobby Byrd's first album,"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"is Johnny Nash with ""Hold Me Tight."""
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Whoa, you know,"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"Johnny Nash is the most famous for ""I Can See Clearly Now."""
01:25:35;01:25:36;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"I didn't know he had any other hits."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"You know one interesting thing about Johnny Nash?"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Not Jamaican."
01:25:52;01:25:53;"He's from Texas."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"Right."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"I was going to say,"
01:25:55;01:25:59;"how is it that this guy had these kind of reggae inflected hits,"
01:25:59;01:26:04;"but there weren't other reggae hits in the late '60s, were there?"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"The dude just dug deep in the bins, you know?"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"He was a guy from Texas."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"I guess he moved to Jamaica at some point."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"Really?"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"He was already like an adult professional singer."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"He's got a really pleasant little song."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Oh, yeah, very tasteful."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"I love it."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"Beautiful voice."
01:26:27;01:26:32;"But he is such an outlier on the charts of the late '60s."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"I would have thought there'd be more music like this."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"I mean, it's a good question."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Like, definitely in England,"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"there was reggae all up in the charts in 1968."
01:26:42;01:26:45;"I think Desmond Decker, who he kind of sounds like,"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"charted in the U.S."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I'm going to throw on ""Israelites"" by Desmond Decker."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"What year is that?"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"I think that's '69."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"I know it's '68 as well."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"I'm getting a beer."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Yeah, me too."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"By all means."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Yeah, so, same year."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"This song rules."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Yeah, beautiful."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"All right, so this is a global hit, actually."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"This is number one in the U.K.,"
01:27:14;01:27:17;"but it cracked the top ten in the U.S."
01:27:29;01:27:34;"How come they never use this in American movies about the '60s?"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"In my neighborhood."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Yeah."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Is that the VO?"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Yeah, we're doing--"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"1968 Brooklyn."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"""Israelites"" playing."
01:27:45;01:27:48;"Or I'm also just picturing, like, young Steven Spielberg,"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"what was his movie, ""Meet the Fablemans""?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yeah."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Did you guys see that one?"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"No."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Yeah, that was pretty good, actually."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I refuse to engage with that title."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Too corny for me."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"I thought the movie was going to be cornier because of stuff like that."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Mm-hmm."
01:28:04;01:28:10;"But you might appreciate the depiction of 1950s, 1960s Phoenix."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"That sounds interesting."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Yeah, I should watch it just for that."
01:28:16;01:28:19;"Is this, like, playing on, like, the radio in Texas?"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"I bet so, man."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"It'd be like ""Hey Jude"" by the Beatles into this,"
01:28:23;01:28:27;"into, like, a Marvin Gaye, Tammy Turrell song."
01:28:29;01:28:33;"Let's check out the number five song in our world."
01:28:33;01:28:37;"2023, the number five song is ""Doja Cat"" with ""Paint the Town Red."""
01:28:37;01:28:40;"You Doja Cat fan, Carson?"
01:28:40;01:28:45;"It's a complicated question because she's on my jogging mix,"
01:28:45;01:28:51;"which I go hard into top five songs I would never listen to in the rest of my life."
01:28:51;01:28:54;"But this is--I've jogged many miles to this song."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"To this song, you know it."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"I probably know it by heart."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"With a sample from the 1960s, ""Walk on By"" by Dionne Warwick."
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Wait, so, Carson, like, you don't make the playlist?"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Like, is it like a--"
01:29:10;01:29:15;"No, I make it, but I put on, like, all kinds of stuff like this."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"I actually shared it with you, remember?"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Oh, right."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"I don't think I really checked it out."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"You can't jog to Graham Parsons?"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"No."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"Really?"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"That's relaxing music for me."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"But here's what I'm asking."
01:29:29;01:29:33;"Like, do you know what the song sounds like when you put it on the mix,"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"or are you just throwing songs on randomly you've never heard that are current hits"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"and you learn the songs as you're running?"
01:29:38;01:29:42;"I think I heard this, and then I put it on."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"It felt like the right vibe for my jogging mix."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"There's a lot of techno, too."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"Wow."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"What else you got on there?"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Let me see."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"I'll just open it up and let you know."
01:30:01;01:30:02;"Yeah."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"I got--"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"This song is dope."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Definitely one of the best pop--"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"This was on, like, a month or two ago."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Yeah."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Yeah, this is one of the--"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"Definitely the best singles of the year."
01:30:12;01:30:17;"I got really hardcore German rap on my jogging mix."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Okay."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"By Casper Kontra K."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Or ""Flag ist kein Glück."""
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Whoa."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"It's, like, really funny."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"The German rappers are, like, really buff dudes,"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"and I listened to, like, a--"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"I read a translation of the lyrics,"
01:30:34;01:30:37;"and they're all like, ""You can do it."

01:30:39;01:30:40;"Like, it's not--"
01:30:40;01:30:43;"It's really funny that I could tell kind of what it was about"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"without even--"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"It's inspirational?"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"Yeah, they're all about working out, basically, these songs."
01:30:48;01:30:49;"Oh, nice."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Well, that's what you want to listen to."
01:30:51;01:30:53;"Well, and also, they're really--"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"They're, like, 25 years behind,"
01:30:56;01:30:59;"so everything's, like, super influenced by '90s rap,"
01:30:59;01:31:02;"so that's cool, too, if you're an old man like me."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"I feel you."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"It feels really familiar, but, you know."

01:31:25;01:31:27;"Oh, he did? Oh, okay."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"Oh, no, yeah. ""Little Green Apples"" was originally written"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"by Bobby Russell for Roger Miller."
01:31:33;01:31:37;"Roger Miller's version was released in 1968 as well."
01:31:37;01:31:41;"So we got multiple versions competing on the charts."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"It's a different era."
01:31:43;01:31:54;"I like Roger Miller's a lot better."
01:31:54;01:31:57;"What do you think Bobby Byrd would have thought of this?"
01:31:57;01:32:00;"I think he'd like Roger Miller's much better, too."
01:32:00;01:32:03;"I'm reading this-- Do you guys talk over these?"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"Yeah, yeah, we talk over them."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"Yeah, this is the show."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"I've been reading this--"
01:32:09;01:32:12;"reading this book called ""Nashville Storyteller"""
01:32:12;01:32:15;"by-- Oh, God, I'm so bad with names."
01:32:15;01:32:19;"But it's about this great musician, written by him."
01:32:19;01:32:22;"It's all about just songwriting"
01:32:22;01:32:26;"and taking uppers in Nashville in the '70s."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"It's called-- Sounds sick."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"It's really good."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"He hangs out with Roger Miller."
01:32:33;01:32:41;"# And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"# In Disneyland Mother Goose is no worse for ride #"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"Oh, yeah, I remember this song."
01:32:46;01:32:49;"But he took all the energy back."
01:32:49;01:32:52;"And it didn't have a lot to begin with."
01:32:52;01:33:00;"It's just such a weird lyric, too."
01:33:00;01:33:03;"If that's not loving me, then all I gotta say is"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"God didn't make little green apples"
01:33:05;01:33:08;"and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"There's no such thing as Dr. Seuss."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"They're so random, you're almost not sure."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"It makes me think of that song, like,"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"someone left the cake out in the rain, where you're just like--"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"What the hell is this song about?"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"That song probably is also from '68-ish."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Yeah."
01:33:26;01:33:30;"Brian's got Saddle in the Rain, which is a similar sentiment."
01:33:30;01:33:36;"# Sometimes I call her up at home"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"# Knowing she's busy #"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"All right, let's move off this low energy."
01:33:42;01:33:46;"Number four song right now on Apple Music, Drake,"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"featuring Sexy Red and SZA, Rich Baby Daddy."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Damn."
01:33:52;01:33:56;"Oh, and Florence and the Machine are credited as songwriters"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"due to the song interpolating Dog Days Are Over"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"by Florence and the Machine."
01:34:01;01:34:10;"# Bend it over, let that breathe #"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"# Shake that #"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"# Hands on your knees #"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"So this is new. This is new Drake."
01:34:18;01:34:21;"This is from Drake's latest album, For All The Dogs."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"Good title."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"That is a good title."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"# Hands on your knees #"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"# Shake that for Drake #"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"# I still got some love deep inside of me #"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"# You know me, delight in me #"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"# You know you got a guy, he's not a guy to me #"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"# Just say goodbye to him #"
01:34:43;01:34:47;"Tom T. Hall was the writer of Nashville songs."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Oh, dude, Tom T. Hall, man."
01:34:49;01:34:52;"Yeah, Tom T. Hall, he's a legend."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Yeah, he's awesome."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"Don't Forget The Coffee, is that one of his songs?"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"He's obsessed with coffee."
01:34:59;01:35:02;"That's what he talks about in the first chapter of the book."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Oh, really?"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Yeah, he worries on..."
01:35:06;01:35:09;"He's a kid in the South, and he sells a song."
01:35:09;01:35:12;"And it's just enough money to buy a Cadillac."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"So he buys that with all of his money."
01:35:15;01:35:20;"And he's barreling towards Nashville to live there and become a songwriter."
01:35:20;01:35:24;"And he's just always talking about how he's worried he won't--"
01:35:24;01:35:28;"He'll hit a stretch so long he won't get a cup of coffee."
01:35:28;01:35:31;"Is he like a 20 cups a day kind of guy?"
01:35:31;01:35:35;"Yeah, I feel like a lot of his songs are about the industry."
01:35:35;01:35:40;"I mean, that song ""Homecoming"" is like the best short story ever."
01:35:40;01:35:42;"That's the one he's talking to his dad."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"Yeah, it's so good."
01:35:45;01:35:50;"He's just like, ""Sorry I wasn't home for Mom's wedding--or Mom's funeral."""
01:35:50;01:35:52;"He's just like this [expletive]"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"""We got a gig. We got a gig."""
01:35:54;01:35:59;"And then his new wife, who's the keyboard player in the band, is sitting in the car."
01:35:59;01:36:04;"And he's wearing a bunch of flare that he's embarrassed about."
01:36:04;01:36:07;"He has to explain it to his dad."
01:36:07;01:36:12;"All right, let's move on to the number three song this week in 1968."
01:36:12;01:36:16;"Diana Ross and the Supremes' ""Love Child."""
01:36:16;01:36:18;"Great song."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"Another story song."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"Yeah."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"This reminds me a little of Minnie Riperton."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I was really late to discovering her."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Oh yeah, amazing voice."
01:36:44;01:36:49;"It sounds like the Supremes were trying to find something that wasn't just another love song."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Yeah."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Trying to be a little edgy."
01:36:56;01:37:00;"I definitely remember listening to oldies radio as a kid and being like,"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"""Whoa, this is a different look for the Supremes."""
01:37:02;01:37:06;"Even when I was 14."
01:37:06;01:37:10;"Totally familiar with Baby Love and Stopping the Name of Love"
01:37:10;01:37:15;"and all the classics from the mid-60s."
01:37:15;01:37:19;"They had Ain't No Mountain High Enough also, which we heard a few months ago,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"which was a different sound."
01:37:21;01:37:26;"This was specifically, I was like, ""This line is hardcore."""
01:37:26;01:37:31;"We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating."
01:37:42;01:37:47;"In a way, are they saying that they need to let that [beep] breathe?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Excuse me, Seinfeld?"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"I'm just referencing the last song."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Oh, is that what she was saying?"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"Oh, Sexy Red, Let That [beep] Breathe."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"That's what Sexy Red was saying."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:37:57;01:38:01;"Ezra, I can't believe you missed that line."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I was in Tum Tee Hall World."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"Yeah, I didn't hear any of that song."
01:38:06;01:38:09;"I just spaced out thinking about country music."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"Hey, guys, can I say something else about Seeger real quick?"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Yeah, Bob Seeger?"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"Bob Seeger."
01:38:36;01:38:44;"The reason I don't like Seeger is kind of – it's funny because I can trace it all the way back to being 14 and peer pressure"
01:38:44;01:38:50;"because my dad's friend who introduced me to Bowie and Big Star and Nick Lowe and I could just –"
01:38:50;01:38:55;"he would send me to Best Buy and just pick out five great albums for me every time."
01:38:55;01:39:01;"I had Seeger once, and he picked up the CD and he went, ""Ooh, Seeger, bad,"""
01:39:01;01:39:09;"and he threw it on my desk with disdain, and that's the only reason I don't like Bob Seeger."
01:39:09;01:39:15;"It's not even my taste or my choice, which is kind of sad."
01:39:15;01:39:16;"Wow."
01:39:16;01:39:19;"I mean, it's funny because he has a mixed bag."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Old-time rock and roll."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Pretty rough."
01:39:22;01:39:27;"Not a particularly cool song, although it goes off live."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Let me tell you."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"That's true."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"You know what I love?"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Pull the roof off the place."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"I mean, and like Jake said, beautiful ballads."
01:39:35;01:39:40;"I'm very partial to We've Got Tonight, but Carson, how familiar are you with Still the Same?"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"I do remember Dance."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"Throw on Still the Same."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Yeah, beautiful song."
01:39:47;01:39:51;"Yeah, actually, Bob's the master of the mid-tempo ballad."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"It's not the –"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"You know what?"
01:39:53;01:39:54;"I like this song."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"You know it, right?"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"Yeah."
01:39:56;01:39:59;"Especially the opening chords, it kind of sends a chill up your spine."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Yeah."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Beautiful."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Yeah."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Jim Cherry steered me wrong on this one."
01:40:04;01:40:10;"You always won every time you placed the bet."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"I mean, come on."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Talk about a toe-tapper."
01:40:13;01:40:16;"I'm literally tapping my toe over here."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"As am I, dude."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Didn't even realize I was."
01:40:18;01:40:21;"You're totally right."
01:40:21;01:40:27;"And just great song craft, like the way the chords change here."
01:40:27;01:40:34;"Yeah, he doesn't get props as a guy that wrote beautiful, powerful melodies."
01:40:34;01:40:41;"You always said, ""Carson never did you wrong."""
01:40:41;01:40:48;"The problem, too, was like, the album I bought was his greatest hits, and he looks so corny"
01:40:48;01:40:52;"on the cover at an age where that kind of thing mattered to me."
01:40:52;01:40:55;"I know what you mean, man."
01:40:55;01:41:01;"It took me – when I was a teenager, I definitely was not down with Bob Seger."
01:41:01;01:41:08;"And especially that era when Like a Rock was on all of those car ads."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"Yeah."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"Yeah, and I was like, ""This guy sucks."""
01:41:13;01:41:16;"Yeah, he didn't do himself any favors with that bullsh*t."
01:41:16;01:41:22;"And my association with him was like, all-time rock and roll and Like a Rock, which is admittedly"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"later period."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"It's 80s Seger."
01:41:25;01:41:29;"And then it was only after really listening to Against the Wind or something where I was"
01:41:29;01:41:30;"like, ""Oh, this is –"""
01:41:30;01:41:36;"Yeah, and I could also see – if you picture the Against the Wind album cover, it's light"
01:41:36;01:41:40;"blue with these horses running and you see the reflection on it."
01:41:40;01:41:47;"In the '90s, probably for a lot of people, that connoted being in somebody's weird basement"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"that smelled like cigarettes."
01:41:49;01:41:54;"Just kind of like – something that would associate a depressing image for a kid who"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"grew up in the '80s or '90s."
01:41:56;01:42:01;"I don't know, like if your dad took you to a bar or something, just like that imagery."
01:42:01;01:42:06;"Whereas by the 2000s, you can look at that cover with the horses running on it as being"
01:42:06;01:42:10;"kind of an amazing piece of American kitsch."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"And maybe not even that, maybe transcends kitsch."
01:42:12;01:42:18;"Just like – I'm not just like – unironically just make an American rock album and just"
01:42:18;01:42:25;"have like five white stallions running across some puddles and they're –"
01:42:25;01:42:29;"It's like thrift store art, but completely unironic."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Yeah."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Want to hear another Drake song?"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"He has to do it."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"Oh, he got another hit?"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"I think Drake's dominating the top five."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Does he have a new album or something?"
01:42:46;01:42:50;"Yeah, he had a new album last month and this song is called IDGF."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Anybody know what that stands for?"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"I don't give a –"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Thank God it's Friday."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Oh no."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"[Laughter]"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"I don't give a Friday?"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"I don't give a Friday."
01:43:01;01:43:05;"I demand God allow Fridays."
01:43:05;01:43:07;"I don't girlfriend."
01:43:07;01:43:10;"I demand good fried eggs."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"[Laughter]"
01:43:12;01:43:16;"That's true of me, but I'll do it politely, you know."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"I don't got friends."
01:43:18;01:43:20;"[Laughter]"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"I don't got a friend."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"I don't got any friends."
01:43:24;01:43:27;"It does sound like kind of a sad song."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Maybe it is about I don't got a friend."
01:43:29;01:43:34;"I mean, the real big celebs don't have friends."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"It's true."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"Drake famously said no new friends a while back,"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"but then if you followed his career,"
01:43:41;01:43:46;"you'd get the impression that he's been betrayed many times by fake friends"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"and clout chasers."
01:43:47;01:43:51;"So between the no new friends and the sharp drop off,"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"he probably has no friends."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"That's how you end up with the song I don't got a friend."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"And this is featuring Yeet."
01:43:59;01:44:02;"Seinfeld, you want to tell us about Yeet?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Yeet?"
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Who's Yeet?"
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Yeet."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Oh, man."
01:44:08;01:44:11;"So I must be really losing touch."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Yeah, Yeet."
01:44:12;01:44:15;"I'm learning about Yeet right now in real time."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Benny X."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"I don't got a friend."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"I can tell you about Yeet."
01:44:23;01:44:27;"Seinfeld, can you just read the Wikipedia page for Yeet?"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"I'm on it."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"Born Noah Oliver Smith."
01:44:31;01:44:35;"He's an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer."
01:44:35;01:44:39;"Known for his experimental sound and unconventional fashion."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"Thank you, Seinfeld."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"Okay."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"In a totally different direction."
01:44:56;01:45:00;"1968, the number two song."
01:45:00;01:45:03;"I actually, I always love this song."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"I don't know if we've ever heard it on TC before."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Mary Hopkins with ""Those Were The Days."""
01:45:07;01:45:09;"You guys know this one?"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Maybe."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Paul McCartney produced it."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:15;01:45:19;"It's a rewrite of a Russian folk song."
01:45:19;01:45:25;"How the hell did Paul McCartney have time in 1968 to produce a Mary Hopkins record?"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Three hours at the studio."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"That's what Lenin said."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Yeah."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"Come on, Paul."
01:45:34;01:45:37;"John was like, ""Paul, I have time."""
01:45:37;01:45:39;"I wish I could do it better, John."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Focus, Paul."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Focus."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"Hey, did you guys listen to that new Beatles song?"
01:45:43;01:45:44;"Speaking of John and Paul."
01:45:44;01:45:48;"They should have left that one in the archives."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Yeah."
01:45:50;01:45:53;"It's like tainting my like a bird, you know?"
01:45:53;01:45:56;"I mean, it's not a Beatles song."
01:45:56;01:45:59;"There's a reason it didn't see the light of day."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"We'd live the life we choose."
01:46:02;01:46:05;"We'd fight and never lose."
01:46:05;01:46:13;"For we were young and sure to have our way."
01:46:13;01:46:16;"It's a touch corny, but it is a cool Russian melody."
01:46:16;01:46:17;"No, I like this."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"Just think about that."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"This is 1968."
01:46:20;01:46:23;"To me, this is like Tinker Tailor, Soldier, Spy."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"Just like height of the Cold War."
01:46:26;01:46:29;"And up on the charts in America and the UK,"
01:46:29;01:46:32;"is this like pretend Russian song?"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"You know what I mean?"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"I'm just thinking like George Smiley in Control,"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"just like getting in a taxi."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"And this is like playing on the radio."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"It gives me like eerie Cold War vibes."
01:46:44;01:46:47;"I feel like I'm getting Dresden Dolls PTSD."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Yes, I know what you mean."
01:46:49;01:46:52;"Not quite as cool 40 years later."
01:46:52;01:46:58;"For the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Also, okay, how about this?"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"Of course, this is cheesy in many ways."
01:47:03;01:47:06;"But imagine this."
01:47:06;01:47:10;"English CIA is MI6 or is it MI5?"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"One of them."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"I think it's MI5."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Jake, you should know this."
01:47:14;01:47:19;"MI6 is the FBI, and I think MI5 is the CIA."
01:47:19;01:47:23;"Just picture this. You're standing in front of a brutalist apartment building."
01:47:23;01:47:27;"You're an Oxford-educated MI6 agent"
01:47:27;01:47:31;"who's selling secrets to the Soviets."
01:47:31;01:47:36;"And this is just like blasting out of a shop."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"And there's like a slow zoom on you."
01:47:38;01:47:41;"A man between two worlds."
01:47:41;01:47:44;"Deep in your heart, you want to take down England."
01:47:44;01:47:48;"But you also feel bad about betraying all your friends in MI5."
01:47:48;01:47:53;"Mary Hopkins tearing up the charts with ""Those Were the Days."""
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Wow, that's good. I like that."
01:47:55;01:47:59;"I mean, I wonder if anyone at MI5 was legit like,"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"""Is this a Russian op? How is this on?"""
01:48:02;01:48:05;"How did they get to Paul McCartney?"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"How did they penetrate the charts?"
01:48:07;01:48:12;"Is Paul McCartney low-key a Russian spy?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"How did they get to Paul?"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Yeah."
01:48:15;01:48:18;"You know, all the Beatles are spies, right?"
01:48:18;01:48:22;"Yeah, they had to open up files on all the Beatles."
01:48:22;01:48:27;"I'm sure you guys have discussed so much rock history here,"
01:48:27;01:48:31;"but I heard they wrote that ""We Don't Want a Revolution"" song"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"so they wouldn't get deported."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Oh, just to like turn down the heat a bit?"
01:48:34;01:48:37;"Yeah, they were like, ""We don't want a revolution."""
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Like, ""Don't deport us."""
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Wait, from America or from where?"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"From America."
01:48:42;01:48:46;"They thought they were going to get deported for being too, you know--"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Like they wouldn't be allowed back in the country?"
01:48:48;01:48:51;"Jim Cherry could tell us."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"As much as he hates Seger, he knows more rock history"
01:48:54;01:48:57;"than any man I've ever met."
01:48:57;01:49:01;"I also thought ""Revolution"" was like John Lennon's kind of snarky,"
01:49:01;01:49:07;"snide response to like fake politics of like the hippie movement."
01:49:07;01:49:10;"Yeah, I think he was distancing himself from it."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"But like, I don't know."
01:49:12;01:49:16;"I like this song."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"I like this vibe."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"It reminds me of the McGregor Sisters, too."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"I'm digging my heels in. I'm anti this song."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"Sorry, guys."
01:49:26;01:49:29;"Am I wrong that the tempo shifts?"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Like this song gets--"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"I think it's got a little speed up, like that classic like"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"East Block speed up, a little bit of Tetris,"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"a little bit of Tetris energy."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"[laughter]"
01:49:41;01:49:46;"We're on the number two song right now in our current universe."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Yep."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"2023. ""Jungkook and Lotto"" with Seven."
01:49:55;01:49:58;"Now, Jake, of course, you know Jungkook. You're a fan."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"Is he from BTS?"
01:50:01;01:50:02;"That's right."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Okay."
01:50:10;01:50:14;"This is kind of like some throwback UK vibes."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"It's like a Craig David."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Yeah, Craig David."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Is this about the David Fincher film?"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"[laughter]"
01:50:22;01:50:27;"I ate in the same Italian restaurant as BTS a few months ago."
01:50:27;01:50:29;"Wait, say that again, Carson."
01:50:29;01:50:32;"I'm going to do a little name dropping here."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"I went to have dinner with my friend Mike Judge."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Nice."
01:50:36;01:50:42;"He was very excited when I got there because BTS was filming a reality show"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"in like two booths over."
01:50:44;01:50:48;"Are you and Mike Judge in the background?"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"Yeah, probably."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"Wait, Carson, you're talking about the K-pop group?"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Yeah."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"Not Bill Disville. Okay, we just have to check."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"Is he a BTS fan?"
01:51:00;01:51:04;"He knew about them way more than me from making New Beavis and Buttheads."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"But he was kind of starstruck."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"It was really funny."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"I'd never seen him like – he was like really excited and kind of nervous."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"He's like, ""Holy sh*t, Carson, that's BTS."""
01:51:14;01:51:16;"I was like, ""Carson?"""
01:51:16;01:51:21;"[laughter]"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"I got to check out those New Beavis and Butthead episodes."
01:51:24;01:51:30;"I would love to hear Butthead be like, ""Ugh,"" and just kind of riff, pontificate on BTS."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"On K-pop."
01:51:31;01:51:34;"Oh, man, the new movie, the newest movie was really good."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Oh, it was really good."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Yeah, yeah."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Do the Universe?"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Yeah, that was really good."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Yeah."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"I loved that."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"I got to watch it."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"All right, this is a fun song."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"So, unfortunately, the seven is for seven days a week."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"It's not for the seven deadly sins."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"That would have been very provocative and bold."
01:52:01;01:52:06;"The number one song this week in 1968 is the Beatles with ""Hey Jude."""
01:52:11;01:52:12;"Paul was busy."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"What can you say about ""Hey Jude?"""
01:52:15;01:52:16;"It's a good song."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"It's a long song."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"People sometimes forget it's a long song."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"I think it's been – I don't know, seven minutes?"
01:52:27;01:52:33;"It's been many years, but I feel like we've heard this song on this show at least five times."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Yes, we often catch this."
01:52:35;01:52:40;"I feel like we did a lot of top fives in 1968, like five years ago."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"This is interesting."
01:52:47;01:52:54;"I mean, everybody knows about that supposedly this is Paul saying something to John Lennon's son"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"when his parents were getting divorced."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"""Hey Jules."""
01:52:57;01:53:00;"Yes, ""Hey Jules,"" and he changed it to ""Jude."""
01:53:00;01:53:05;"I guess Julian actually spoke on it on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"This is what he had to say."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"""I have a love-hate relationship with it, I have to say."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"The fact that Dad walked out, walked away, left Mom and I,"
01:53:13;01:53:18;"that was a point of complete change and complete disruption and complete darkness and sadness."
01:53:18;01:53:23;"I mean, I was only three, but I recognized that something was up, you know?"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"But for Mom, it was heartbreaking."
01:53:25;01:53:28;"So it's a reminder of that time and that place."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"So I get both sides of it."
01:53:29;01:53:35;"But a lot of people don't necessarily understand there's a dark yin and yang of that song."""
01:53:35;01:53:37;"I feel it."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"Yes."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"I guess that is pretty harsh."
01:53:40;01:53:46;"He's three, still perceiving something's off and not seeing his dad as much."
01:53:46;01:53:52;"But yes, imagine Cynthia, the mom, just this monster hit"
01:53:52;01:53:57;"that's this kind of sad, cheer-up song for her son, whose dad left."
01:53:57;01:54:03;"Did Paul and John have a Ray Davies-Dave Davies relationship where he would be like--"
01:54:03;01:54:07;"Paul would come in and be like, ""I wrote this song about how you're a s---y dad."""
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Or did he hit it from him?"
01:54:09;01:54:14;"I've read John interviews where John interpreted it positively."
01:54:14;01:54:18;"There's even one where he said-- an interview in the '70s where he said,"
01:54:18;01:54:21;"""Yeah, you know, Paul wrote this thing, and it's kind of about my son,"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"but I think it was also to me."
01:54:23;01:54:27;"You know, 'Hey, John.' A little bit of 'Keep Your Head Up' to me."""
01:54:27;01:54:31;"So I don't-- obviously they famously had some beef,"
01:54:31;01:54:37;"but everything I've ever read in terms of John, he kind of was like,"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"""Yeah, good song, and yeah, good looking out."""
01:54:39;01:54:43;"Maybe he's off about the fact that it had anything to do with him."
01:54:43;01:54:46;"I have kind of an epic ""Hey Jude"" story."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"Oh yeah?"
01:54:47;01:54:53;"Yeah, when I was like 15, my dad and his good friend Bob Bozbell,"
01:54:53;01:54:58;"who's an old West historian, and his son Tommy and I,"
01:54:58;01:55:03;"we went on a trip to Chihuahua and Copper Canyon in Mexico."
01:55:03;01:55:08;"And from Chihuahua, you would take this old, janky, clankin' train"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"that you could stand in between the cars and go out on the cattle catcher"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"if you wanted to."
01:55:14;01:55:19;"And one day we had this really cool guide named Jorge,"
01:55:19;01:55:23;"who was the one who would get us everywhere safely."
01:55:23;01:55:29;"And one day we're sitting in the-- when we're on this train,"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"we're talking to Jorge about what kind of music he likes."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"He's like, ""Oh, I love The Beatles."""
01:55:34;01:55:36;"And he starts singing ""Hey Jude."""
01:55:36;01:55:39;"Me and my friend, we start singing along."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"And then my friend's dad, Bob Bozbell,"
01:55:42;01:55:46;"who has a radio personality in Phoenix, so a really big personality."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"Amazing."
01:55:47;01:55:52;"And we hit this section, you know, this part basically."
01:55:52;01:55:56;"And his dad jumps up into the aisle and starts going,"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"""Na-na-na-na, hey Jude."""
01:55:59;01:56:03;"And then slowly the entire train joins in."
01:56:03;01:56:07;"And it was all Mexican people, like Mexican laborers,"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"but they all knew the song and they all loved it."
01:56:09;01:56:14;"The whole train was shaking with ""Hey Jude"" for like five minutes,"
01:56:14;01:56:19;"like as long as fog goes on here is how long Bob sung it."
01:56:19;01:56:23;"And then the coolest part of it all was as soon as it ended,"
01:56:23;01:56:28;"everyone just sat back down and no one said a thing about it."
01:56:28;01:56:33;"It was like we're possessed by Beatle love collectively."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"Just on a train to rural Mexico?"
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Yeah."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"It was so cool."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"It was beautiful."
01:56:39;01:56:44;"I was like, the power of the Beatles can't be understated."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"What year do you think that was?"
01:56:46;01:56:49;"It was 1995."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"27 years after this."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"That's amazing."
01:56:52;01:56:53;"This is at number one."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"Yeah."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"Now let's check out the number one song in our time."
01:56:57;01:57:02;"It's Taylor Swift, debatably the Beatles of 2023,"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"the one-person Beatles,"
01:57:04;01:57:09;"with ""Is It Over Now?"" Taylor's version from 1989, Taylor's version."
01:57:09;01:57:13;"So she re-recorded 1989?"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"I don't know, Seinfeld."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"Let's get a number."
01:57:15;01:57:20;"This is the song that was on the original 1989 and it's re-recorded now?"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Yeah, sorry."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"What is the track?"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"""Is It Over Now?"""
01:57:25;01:57:27;"Okay."
01:57:27;01:57:30;"Released October 27th, 2023."
01:57:30;01:57:37;"With a title like that, you could slip into an Abbott and Costello routine accidentally if you're not careful."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"It's what over now?"
01:57:39;01:57:42;"It's a vault track."
01:57:42;01:57:48;"So it was written during the original release in 2014, but it didn't come out until now."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"Oh, I see."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"So it's one of those highly prized--"
01:57:51;01:57:52;"It didn't make the cut."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"Did not make the cut."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"So this is a B-side?"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"It's an unreleased--"
01:57:57;01:57:58;"Oh, it's unreleased."
01:57:58;01:58:01;"Yeah, yeah, it was in the vault."
01:58:01;01:58:06;"Wow, that is the power of Taylor in 2023, a B-side."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"No, no, no, Jake, not a B-- a lost tape."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"No, Jake, it's not unreleased."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"Okay, my bad, my bad, my bad."
01:58:12;01:58:15;"We're really splitting hairs here on the terminology."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"An unreleased track from 10 years ago or whatever."
01:58:17;01:58:18;"Yeah, from the vault."
01:58:18;01:58:19;"From the vault."
01:58:19;01:58:21;"♪ Come here, I whispered in your ear ♪"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"♪ And you dreamed as you passed out ♪"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"♪ Baby, it was you ♪"
01:58:24;01:58:28;"You know how Castle, that world-famous band,"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"it's an abbreviation of Carson Mow?"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"Yeah."
01:58:31;01:58:35;"Do you think BTS is-- they consciously tried to do the Beatles?"
01:58:35;01:58:38;"Oh, wow."
01:58:38;01:58:40;"So we psychologically would like--"
01:58:40;01:58:43;"I thought you were going to say the TS is for Taylor Swift."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"It's actually boy band Taylor Swift."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"The B is for boy band."
01:58:46;01:58:49;"Boy band."
01:58:49;01:58:54;"Beatles, BTS, Beatles, you know?"
01:58:54;01:58:55;"I mean, it connotes all those things."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"It's got the Beatles, it's got Taylor Swift,"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"it's got all the biggest things in the world."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"All right, it's got Built to Spill,"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"biggest indie rock band out of Idaho."
01:59:03;01:59:04;"It's got everything."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"It definitely is not--"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"Dude, if it was a Built to Spill record,"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"that would blow my mind."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"That's a long-running joke on the show"
01:59:11;01:59:15;"is Jake pretending that BTS is Built to Spill."
01:59:15;01:59:18;"Yeah, Doug took a real turn"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"in his production style about 10 years ago."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"I mean, he did-- his whole goal with that band"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"was to change it up every album."
01:59:26;01:59:29;"But they've gotten to a very deep rut, I would say,"
01:59:29;01:59:32;"since like '98."
01:59:32;01:59:34;"Yeah, I mean, you know, there's always so many--"
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Well, not a rut."
01:59:35;01:59:37;"Yeah, I like the new BTS."
01:59:37;01:59:40;"I just-- yeah, at a certain point,"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"you're like-- if you're an artist,"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"you only have so many moves."
01:59:43;01:59:46;"If you look at those first three or four albums,"
01:59:46;01:59:48;"each one did have a really distinct sound."
01:59:48;01:59:50;"Agreed."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"Like, up until Perfect From Now on,"
01:59:52;01:59:55;"and now it's all in that kind of world, right?"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"I would say it's all in like the keep it"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"like a secret kind of world."
01:59:59;02:00:00;"Oh, interesting."
02:00:00;02:00:02;"Because we've talked so much about Built to Spill"
02:00:02;02:00:04;"on this show because of the popularity"
02:00:04;02:00:06;"of the Korean group BTS."
02:00:06;02:00:10;"Jake, why don't we go out-- or Carson, maybe,"
02:00:10;02:00:11;"because you're a special guest."
02:00:11;02:00:13;"Why don't we go out, Carson, on your favorite"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"Built to Spill song?"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"Because we might have some listeners who've"
02:00:17;02:00:20;"been hearing us talk about this band for eight years,"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"and they don't know what they sound like."
02:00:23;02:00:25;"All they know is that they share the initials"
02:00:25;02:00:28;"of the Korean monster boy band."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"What's your favorite Built to Spill song?"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"I mean, I was obsessed with them,"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"so I'm just going to pick a favorite."
02:00:34;02:00:37;"Which album are you going to go off?"
02:00:37;02:00:40;"I think I'll probably go off of Perfect From Now on,"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"just because we're talking about it."
02:00:42;02:00:47;"Chicted in the Sun might be my favorite off of that."
02:00:47;02:00:50;"All right, well, thank you very much to Carson Mel."
02:00:50;02:00:53;"Check out the new book, Cherry on Top."
02:00:53;02:00:55;"It's available at Secret Headquarters."
02:00:55;02:00:57;"Oh, yeah, where do you get it?"
02:00:57;02:01:00;"Just Google Secret Headquarters Cherry on Top or my name,"
02:01:00;02:01:02;"and it'll pop up."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"But it's through the Secret Headquarters website."
02:01:04;02:01:06;"All right, here's some Built to Spill."
02:01:06;02:01:08;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
02:01:08;02:01:09;"See you later."
02:01:09;02:01:10;"Thanks."
