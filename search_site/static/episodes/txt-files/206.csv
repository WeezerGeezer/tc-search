00:25;00:27;"Time Crisis"
00:27;00:29;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:37;00:42;"Passed me by all of those great romances"
00:42;00:49;"You were a felt rubbing me of my rightful chances"
00:49;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:03;"And so I dealt you the blow when the bus had to go"
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:14;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"

01:18;01:23;"Time Crisis back again, Thanksgiving weekend"
01:23;01:25;"What's up fellas?"
01:25;01:31;"It's a big weekend, everyone's feasting, hanging out with family and friends"
01:31;01:35;"We thought it'd be a great time to dive into the careers"
01:35;01:40;"of two relatively obscure one-hit wonders from the 70s"
01:40;01:42;"It's TC"
01:42;01:46;"It's TC baby, we're doing something nice and cozy for Thanksgiving"
01:46;01:48;"Struggle up"
01:48;01:54;"There might be some TC families who are gathered around listening to this episode live"
01:54;01:58;"Maybe a TC couple going for an autumnal drive"
01:58;02:01;"Somewhere where the leaves change colors"
02:01;02:05;"I mean Thanksgiving is a great holiday, it's one of the best"
02:05;02:08;"You're a Thanksgiving fan right, Jake?"
02:08;02:10;"Oh yeah, big time, I agree, one of the best"
02:10;02:13;"I can see a TC Friendsgiving"
02:13;02:14;"Oh I would love it"
02:14;02:17;"Oh for sure, get the whole crew together"
02:17;02:21;"Alright, enough beating around the bush, people have been already talking about"
02:21;02:25;"They've had their Thanksgiving meals, they've seen their families"
02:25;02:27;"Let's get into the good stuff"
02:27;02:30;"Jake, you picked a song to start us off today"
02:30;02:32;"Steve Forbert"
02:32;02:36;"This is a guy, I feel like I've been seeing his name my whole life"
02:36;02:39;"I feel like I've been seeing, I've seen his records a lot"
02:39;02:43;"When I used to be really into like, you know, buying used records"
02:43;02:44;"Crate digging?"
02:44;02:46;"Yeah, when I was crate digging"
02:46;02:50;"There was, I know this is totally off, but I feel like I would see"
02:50;02:52;"Yeah, I know I've seen this face before"
02:52;02:54;"He has a very interesting face"
02:54;02:59;"Everybody look up the Steve Forbert Alive on Arrival album"
02:59;03:01;"Honestly, it's weird, you know, you know there's like"
03:01;03:03;"You see these weird things online sometimes"
03:03;03:06;"It's like, have you seen this man?"
03:06;03:08;"Many people have seen him in dreams"
03:08;03:11;"Many people have seen this man in their sleep paralysis"
03:11;03:13;"Yeah, he does have a bizarre face"
03:13;03:16;"I mean, I'm looking at the Jackrabbit Slim cover as well"
03:16;03:19;"You know, you guys don't think he looks exactly like"
03:19;03:21;"A bizarro Lou Reed?"
03:21;03:23;"A little bit, a tiny bit"
03:23;03:25;"I could see it"
03:25;03:29;"But Steve Forbert, yeah, I feel like I'd always see Steve Forbert albums"
03:29;03:30;"When I'd be crate digging"
03:30;03:33;"A lot of like Dan Fogelberg"
03:33;03:36;"But I know Dan Fogelberg is actually like a major artist"
03:36;03:38;"Yeah, a different scene too"
03:38;03:40;"I think Dan Fogelberg is like straight up soft rock"
03:40;03:43;"Wait, so did you used to have a vinyl collection?"
03:43;03:46;"Because I always think of you as like, not a record collector"
03:46;03:50;"I went so hard in my younger years that I'm still like kind of recovering"
03:50;03:54;"And now everybody has like a nice vinyl setup at home"
03:54;03:56;"And I'm kind of behind the times"
03:56;03:57;"But do you have records?"
03:57;03:59;"I've never seen like a record collection"
03:59;04:01;"I have thousands of records"
04:01;04:01;"Where are they?"
04:01;04:04;"No, I think I gave most of them away actually"
04:04;04:05;"Okay, here's the thing"
04:05;04:08;"I may have told this story before, but it's Thanksgiving weekend"
04:08;04:10;"We can retell some stories"
04:10;04:12;"That's what Thanksgiving weekend's all about"
04:12;04:13;"Retelling the same stories"
04:13;04:16;"The same story you've heard for decades"
04:16;04:18;"I was always pretty into records"
04:18;04:22;"And my parents, they had their records, you know, well into the 90s"
04:22;04:24;"In the dining room"
04:24;04:25;"And the record player was there"
04:25;04:28;"So I learned a lot from like digging through their records"
04:28;04:29;"And looking at them"
04:29;04:30;"And they were very present"
04:30;04:32;"They weren't like out in the garage or anything"
04:32;04:33;"They were in the household"
04:33;04:36;"We've discussed your dad's record collection quite a few times"
04:36;04:38;"And ended with Run DMC"
04:38;04:39;"Yeah"
04:39;04:42;"And then when I started getting into records myself"
04:42;04:45;"A lot of it was kind of, you know, driving around New Jersey"
04:45;04:50;"With my boy Andre and friend of the show Wes Miles"
04:50;04:53;"You know, our crew, because we were all into the same stuff"
04:53;04:57;"So we would do a lot of, you know, going to thrift stores"
04:57;04:58;"And going to yard sales"
04:58;05:00;"We're kind of obsessed with yard sales"
05:00;05:04;"And, you know, at that point you go to, you know"
05:04;05:06;"When would this have been?"
05:06;05:07;"'98, '99?"
05:07;05:11;"You go to a New Jersey yard sale"
05:11;05:14;"You'd have all these, yeah, how, it's funny to think now"
05:14;05:15;"How old these people have been"
05:15;05:19;"You might probably have, like, people who are, like, 50 or 60"
05:19;05:21;"And they had all this, like, cool stuff from the 60s and 70s"
05:21;05:22;"They were getting rid of"
05:22;05:25;"Their old books, their old records"
05:25;05:28;"You know, maybe they were building their CD collection"
05:28;05:29;"And so you'd find good stuff"
05:29;05:31;"And I was just, like, into buying records"
05:31;05:33;"I'd go to Montclair, New Jersey"
05:33;05:36;"Had a thriving used records scene"
05:36;05:38;"Multiple stores"
05:38;05:40;"But then here's where it got crazy"
05:40;05:45;"Is that one day, me and the boys roll up to a yard sale"
05:45;05:47;"I believe this is in Montclair, New Jersey"
05:47;05:50;"And this guy just had a couple thousand records"
05:50;05:51;"Boxes on boxes"
05:51;05:54;"And we're looking through and seeing if we can find anything good"
05:54;05:57;"And then the guy says, ""Is that your guy's car?"""
05:57;05:58;"It was my friend's car"
05:58;05:58;"And we're like, ""Yeah"""
05:58;06:01;"And he's like, ""You think you could fit all these records in there?"""
06:01;06:02;"And we're like, ""Oh, I don't know"""
06:02;06:04;"And he's like, ""If you can, they're yours"""
06:04;06:07;"And we were so hyped"
06:07;06:10;"And I ended up, I think we first took them to my house"
06:10;06:11;"Everybody picked them over"
06:11;06:14;"But I ended up keeping the bulk of them"
06:14;06:17;"And I'm sure this guy was just psyched to get rid of it"
06:17;06:20;"Because it was, like, 90% crap"
06:20;06:21;"I think this guy was-"
06:21;06:23;"Dan Fogelberg?"
06:23;06:24;"Well, I don't think-"
06:24;06:25;"Dan Fogelberg's not crap"
06:25;06:26;"I don't want to diss him"
06:26;06:31;"But a lot of it seemed to have come from the collection of a radio station"
06:31;06:36;"Because I remember I'd even sometimes pull out, like, a 1978 RCA Records press release"
06:36;06:38;"From some, like, really random band"
06:38;06:40;"There was some cool stuff in there"
06:40;06:47;"But a lot of the records were the dregs of the big labels' 70s and 80s releases"
06:47;06:50;"So it's, like, just stuff you never heard of"
06:50;06:53;"Atlanta Rhythm Section?"
06:53;06:54;"There might be stuff like that"
06:54;06:58;"Atlanta Rhythm Section has a couple of songs with-"
06:58;07:05;"It's hard to think of, like, truly obscure bands from the 70s that, like-"
07:05;07:09;"The reason we know obscure bands from the 70s now is that they have a few good songs"
07:09;07:13;"It's hard to think of the ones that are just, like, truly, like, ""What is this?"""
07:13;07:14;"Okay, wait, I just found one"
07:14;07:17;"Because I could picture the cover so well"
07:17;07:19;"It's a band called Blue Steel"
07:19;07:21;"And the album is called No More Lonely Nights"
07:21;07:23;"Do you think I've heard of that?"
07:23;07:24;"Yeah, have you heard of Blue Steel?"
07:24;07:28;"Because the album cover is, like, a knight in shining armor in a castle"
07:28;07:31;"With, like, kind of looking lonely"
07:31;07:34;"With his legs up on, like, a feast table"
07:34;07:37;"Okay, so this is an example of just something that-"
07:37;07:38;"A band that I-"
07:38;07:40;"Alright, Blue Steel is a band"
07:40;07:42;"I don't recognize that cover, actually"
07:42;07:45;"See, I'm just saying, this is the kind of random stuff you'd find"
07:45;07:49;"And I remember at the time, we were all, like, really into, like, punk"
07:49;07:51;"You know, I've talked about this-"
07:51;07:51;"Sure"
07:51;07:57;"This is the era where, like, I'd go with Andre to go see television at Irving Plaza"
07:57;08:00;"Like, late 90s, rediscovering all this, like, cool punk stuff"
08:00;08:04;"So I remember also just, like, looking through all these, like, late 70s, early 80s releases"
08:04;08:07;"To be like, ""Is there anything cool, punk, or new wave about this?"""
08:07;08:11;"And then just always being so disappointed by the music"
08:11;08:12;"I'm not dissing Blue Steel"
08:12;08:14;"I don't remember what-"
08:14;08:18;"I just remember the record as, like, a typical random record I had"
08:18;08:20;"And you would throw all these records on?"
08:20;08:21;"You, like, tried them all out?"
08:21;08:23;"I don't think I tried them all out"
08:23;08:28;"I mean, I had a period where I was kind of interested in, like, looking for samples"
08:28;08:29;"Oh, funny"
08:29;08:29;"But-"
08:29;08:31;"So-"
08:31;08:32;"And there was cool stuff, but the-"
08:32;08:34;"But, you know-"
08:34;08:39;"And then just, like, a million 50s and 60s records, like, Herb Alpert, Whipped Cream"
08:39;08:40;"Uh-huh"
08:40;08:41;"So anyway, I had all these records"
08:41;08:44;"Only recently did I start to actually get rid of them"
08:44;08:49;"A lot of them were in my parents' house, in the closet of my childhood bedroom"
08:49;08:51;"And it was difficult to get rid of them"
08:51;08:53;"But yeah, I had a lot of records"
08:53;08:55;"And then I would buy some"
08:55;08:55;"I have some, like-"
08:55;09:00;"I have some interesting, um, rare Karaj Rock compilations"
09:00;09:03;"The kind of stuff you can't find on-"
09:03;09:04;"Rare?"
09:04;09:08;"Rare compilations is a funny pairing of words"
09:08;09:14;"Because they were such limited releases, I have a rare compilation I used to listen to of"
09:14;09:18;"New Jersey garage bands, and they're all from the 60s"
09:18;09:19;"That sounds amazing"
09:19;09:21;"Yeah, I gotta dig that up"
09:21;09:25;"Wait, so did you end up with the Steve Forbert album, Jackrabbit Slims?"
09:25;09:28;"I'm pretty sure I had a Steve Forbert album"
09:28;09:30;"I don't know if I listened to it"
09:30;09:33;"I know this album cover totally well"
09:33;09:34;"I think I did have this record"
09:34;09:39;"I thought of this song because, um, last week we were listening to"
09:39;09:40;"J. Giles Band, and you were talking about like"
09:40;09:44;"""This is just some good, solid, feel-good East Coast rock"""
09:44;09:44;"Yeah"
09:44;09:49;"And I had this Steve Forbert song called ""Romeo's Tune"""
09:49;09:53;"Which came out in December of 1979 on a playlist"
09:53;09:55;"I think I probably heard it on, like, Sirius Radio"
09:55;10:01;"Like, Sirius Radio deep cuts, or like deep, you know, vinyl cuts or whatever"
10:01;10:03;"There's so many, like, stations that kind of just play, like,"
10:03;10:07;"the more offbeat, kind of, 70s stuff"
10:07;10:08;"Yeah"
10:08;10:09;"And I was like, ""What is- this is good"""
10:09;10:14;"It kind of has, like, a little bit of Springsteen, a little bit of Billy Joel"
10:14;10:19;"A little bit of, uh, you know, I don't know, Dire Straits"
10:19;10:22;"But he's got, like, a really nice voice"
10:22;10:25;"And it's got a great kind of feel to it"
10:25;10:28;"And, um, so I added it to, like, a playlist"
10:28;10:31;"And I'm- sometimes I just throw on ""Romeo's Tune"""
10:31;10:34;"And then Nick was saying before the show that-"
10:34;10:35;"friend of the show, Michael Schmeling"
10:35;10:37;"This is one of his, like, favorite songs"
10:37;10:39;"Okay"
10:39;10:43;"It's something that he's put on, I feel like, since I've known him 20 years"
10:43;10:49;"It would make its way to, like, Nick CDs or playlists constantly"
10:49;10:51;"But only the- only this song"
10:51;10:53;"I don't know any other songs by him"
10:53;10:55;"But for about 20 years I've heard this"
10:55;10:57;"It sounds like this is far and away Steve Forbert's biggest hit"
10:57;11:00;"It reached- oh, this is also from 1979"
11:00;11:02;"Same year as ""Blue Steel"" and ""No More Lonely Nights"""
11:02;11:05;"All right, let's listen to ""Romeo's Tune"" by Steve Forbert"
11:05;11:06;"Buckle up, guys"
11:06;11:07;"Yeah"
11:07;11:08;"The music of '79"
11:08;11:20;"Yeah, the '70s pop rock"
11:20;11:23;"This does have an East Coast flavor"
11:23;11:24;"It's East Coast, dude"
11:24;11:26;"East Coast summer, here we go"
11:27;11:40;"Can you kind of hear this in a Noah Baumbach movie?"
11:40;11:41;"Totally"
11:41;11:44;"Yeah, this could be on the ""Squid and the Whale"" soundtrack"
11:44;12:06;"It's also hard to explain, but this is so perfectly 1979"
12:06;12:06;"Yes"
12:07;12:18;"A guy that was real into ""Blood on the Tracks"""
12:18;12:20;"And you know what else? Some Elvis Costello"
12:20;12:21;"Oh, good call"
12:21;12:28;"A big Dylan head"
12:28;12:32;"His Wikipedia page basically says he's from Mississippi"
12:33;12:37;"And moved to New York in '76, '77 to be a part of the punk scene"
12:37;12:47;"And he was probably reading about CBGBs in Cream magazine in Mississippi in 1976"
12:47;12:48;"And he was like, ""I'm going"""
12:48;12:53;"He was born in '54"
12:53;12:56;"And it seems like the rest of his career was pretty folky"
12:56;12:59;"He identifies as a folky guy"
12:59;12:59;"Well, that makes sense"
13:00;13:08;"I hear this as a guy that was into Dylan, into the mid-70s Bruce records, into Billy Joel"
13:08;13:16;"He had moved to New York with a big dream to make it"
13:16;13:18;"And he did"
13:18;13:20;"I mean, this is a classic song"
13:20;13:23;"It was ""Reach Number 11"" in 1980"
13:23;13:26;"I like his voice"
13:26;13:26;"Yeah"
13:27;13:29;"Hey, hey, meet me in the middle of the night"
13:29;13:32;"Let me hear you say everything's all right"
13:32;13:34;"Let me smell the morning air"
13:34;13:37;"But I know what you mean about perfectly 1979"
13:37;13:38;"Yeah, those drums"
13:38;13:41;"I also thought of it because we were talking about J. Giles last episode"
13:41;13:45;"And just that specific palette of early"
13:45;13:48;"I guess for us when we talk about this East Coast, '70s rock"
13:48;13:55;"One thing that connects Bruce, this song, and that '70s J. Giles we're listening to"
13:56;13:58;"Is that, is like the busy piano"
13:58;13:59;"Yeah"
13:59;14:03;"Pretty Billy Joel too"
14:03;14:06;"You know, even like a touch of SNL band"
14:06;14:08;"Oh, for sure"
14:08;14:10;"You can totally picture like some of the session guys that are like"
14:10;14:13;"Played SNL last night"
14:13;14:17;"Oh, Steve Forber wants us to do a Sunday afternoon session"
14:17;14:17;"All right"
14:17;14:21;"All right guys, new song called ""Romeo's Tune"""
14:21;14:22;"All right, all right"
14:22;14:25;"Yeah, I love that"
14:25;14:26;"Shout out to Steve Forber"
14:26;14:28;"Was that song familiar to you at all?"
14:28;14:32;"No, I don't know it, but the vibe was familiar"
14:32;14:35;"I think I could imagine these guys like Steve Forber, Elvis Costello"
14:35;14:38;"They ultimately, they love traditional songwriting"
14:38;14:41;"And they love folk music and Dylan and country"
14:41;14:42;"But they like rock and roll"
14:42;14:46;"So like when punk got going, they enjoyed the minimalist production"
14:46;14:48;"And the sound and the energy"
14:48;14:50;"And then also, you know, like you said"
14:50;14:53;"A great call with Dire Straits"
14:53;14:55;"Because Dire Straits has always been such a weird band"
14:55;15:00;"Because they were like, they came out at the same time as punk"
15:00;15:03;"So they were, almost had a punk energy"
15:03;15:05;"Breaking out with ""Sultans of Swing"""
15:05;15:06;"Like throw ""Sultans of Swing"" on"
15:06;15:08;"I think that's '78"
15:08;15:12;"I think also Dire Straits and Talking Heads did a tour together early on"
15:12;15:12;"Interesting"
15:12;15:13;"In the '70s"
15:13;15:16;"And you can picture that"
15:16;15:20;"Because I don't hear any sort of new way, any punk edge at all with Dire Straits"
15:20;15:25;"No punk edge, but it's like, it is minimalist, simple rock music"
15:25;15:27;"Except the guitar is so next level"
15:27;15:41;"I mean the drums, it's like, I don't know"
15:41;15:45;"You could picture 1978, like you're a kid listening to the radio"
15:45;15:46;"And they play ""Roxanne"" by The Police"
15:46;15:48;"And then they play ""Sultans of Swing"""
15:48;15:49;"And you're kind of like, all right"
15:50;15:51;"New way"
15:51;15:52;"Yeah, no, I could see that"
15:52;15:55;"When I guess we're talking about like punk"
15:55;15:59;"I'm picturing Steve Forbert going to CBGBs in 1977"
15:59;16:03;"And seeing like, yeah, like the New York Dolls or whoever"
16:03;16:05;"Playing some like, truly like"
16:05;16:07;"I just like seeing the Ramones"
16:07;16:09;"Yeah, that would be amazing"
16:09;16:15;"And that's like a totally different universe"
16:15;16:16;"It's totally different"
16:16;16:19;"But you know how also even Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers"
16:19;16:21;"Were a little bit like punk adjacent when they came out?"
16:21;16:22;"Right"
16:22;16:24;"I think there's something that all these guys have"
16:24;16:27;"I don't know what the, what we call this genre"
16:27;16:29;"But it's like classic rock dudes"
16:29;16:31;"But they came out in the late 70s"
16:31;16:33;"So their music's a little more streamlined"
16:33;16:34;"Yeah"
16:34;16:46;"I know Steve Forbert probably didn't edit his own Wikipedia"
16:46;16:48;"But I think there's something very interesting about"
16:49;16:52;"He didn't go to New York to play in punk"
16:52;16:55;"It says he went out there to experience the punk scene"
16:55;16:57;"There's something about like"
16:57;16:59;"It's almost like Dylan would do that"
16:59;17:00;"And that's what I think you're saying"
17:00;17:01;"He's not playing it"
17:01;17:04;"He's just like taking it in"
17:04;17:05;"You want to absorb the energy"
17:05;17:07;"It's just sort of more of an alternative"
17:07;17:09;"Like an adjacent"
17:09;17:11;"And he's, yeah, I just want to experience the energy"
17:11;17:12;"I understand that"
17:12;17:15;"Like, yeah, if you're like a young person who's not growing"
17:15;17:17;"If you, he's growing up in Mississippi"
17:17;17:20;"It's like, and he has like musical ambitions"
17:20;17:21;"And he's like, where do I go?"
17:21;17:24;"Like, how do I like find a channel?"
17:24;17:25;"And he's not like, oh, I'm a punk"
17:25;17:27;"I'm going to go do this"
17:27;17:29;"But I do see what you're saying with Irish Straights"
17:29;17:32;"You could see them being like, oh, this is cool"
17:32;17:40;"It's very poignant, I'm thinking about Steve"
17:40;17:44;"Like, it's almost like you're a young artist"
17:44;17:46;"And like you moved to New York or LA"
17:46;17:49;"And you don't really understand what's going on there"
17:49;17:54;"You've heard it, you've seen media depictions of these cultural capitals"
17:54;17:56;"And you kind of just move there all naive"
17:56;17:59;"And you're like, oh, punk's like the new thing"
17:59;18:02;"I'm going to move there and like go to CBGB"
18:02;18:05;"Hang out and meet people"
18:05;18:06;"But actually he's like a traditionalist"
18:06;18:08;"He's like a, he's a folk guy"
18:08;18:11;"He's a, he likes Billy Joel"
18:11;18:12;"And he's seen the Ramones"
18:12;18:14;"And it's too nihilistic and loud for him"
18:14;18:21;"And it's hot punk, cool funk"
18:21;18:23;"Even if it's old junk, it's still rock and roll to me"
18:23;18:25;"Nice"
18:25;18:28;"But you throw on Irish Straights, Romeo and Juliet"
18:28;18:29;"Well done"
18:29;18:32;"I wonder if Irish Straights were clocking Steve Forbert"
18:32;18:35;"And they heard his 1979 hit Romeo's tune"
18:35;18:39;"And then a year or two later, they drop their Romeo and Juliet"
18:39;18:41;"They were like, that was just a little too punk for us"
18:41;18:44;"Yeah, let's trip back a little bit"
18:44;18:45;"But this is such a funny song too"
18:45;18:49;"Because it's like this beautiful, you know, acoustic picking"
18:49;18:50;"Yeah, it's a great song"
18:50;18:55;"And yet there still is something new wave about it"
18:55;18:55;"Yeah"
18:55;19:02;"I love to strut with Romeo"
19:02;19:05;"Sing the streets of Serenade"
19:05;19:07;"Laying everybody low"
19:07;19:09;"God, Bob Dylan was influential"
19:09;19:11;"Yeah"
19:12;19:16;"I almost like have a little trouble with Irish Straights"
19:16;19:19;"Because it's just like, dude, you're just doing Dylan"
19:19;19:20;"It's so obvious"
19:20;19:22;"It's like, I don't know"
19:22;19:27;"I just, I just, I've all, I can't fully get into Irish Straights"
19:27;19:32;"I feel like people really into Irish Straights, they love the guitar playing"
19:32;19:33;"Yeah, exactly"
19:33;19:37;"You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that"
19:37;19:40;"Anyway, what you gonna do about it"
19:40;19:41;"But you got respect for this song"
19:42;19:43;"Oh, I love it"
19:43;19:44;"I like a lot of Irish Straights songs"
19:44;19:46;"I like like So Far Away and like"
19:46;19:46;"Yeah"
19:46;19:51;"But Dylan recognized Knopfler as a real one"
19:51;19:54;"And he got him to produce and play all over Infidels"
19:54;19:58;"Yeah, I think he's on like Slow Train Coming too"
19:58;19:59;"I think he's on that"
19:59;20:00;"Oh, even earlier?"
20:00;20:01;"I think so, I could be wrong about that"
20:01;20:03;"He's definitely ripping on Joker, man"
20:03;20:04;"Big time"
20:04;20:09;"Late 70s, early 80s"
20:09;20:14;"Traditionalist dudes trying to make it in a new wave world"
20:14;20:15;"Is this genre"
20:15;20:22;"I think we're gonna do about nine episodes of Time Crisis on this world"
20:22;20:24;"We need to come up with a better name for this"
20:24;20:30;"This genre, it's like, it's a little like softer and more sophisticated"
20:30;20:31;"But it's not Yacht Rock"
20:31;20:33;"It's got more edge than Yacht Rock"
20:33;20:35;"Soft wave"
20:35;20:37;"Soft wave? I like that"
20:38;20:39;"Soft bang"
20:39;20:41;"Trad wave?"
20:41;20:43;"Trad wave"
20:43;20:46;"But that almost has like, feels like, I don't know"
20:46;20:49;"Too much picking or something, I don't know"
20:49;20:50;"These guys pick"
20:50;20:52;"Yeah, but these are old guys"
20:52;20:54;"Yeah, but that's like new guys trying to be old"
20:54;20:56;"These are old guys trying to be new"
20:56;20:57;"Oh, Romeo, yeah"
20:57;20:59;"You know, I used to have a scene with him"
20:59;21:01;"They're not that old"
21:01;21:02;"They're like 24"
21:02;21:05;"No, no, no, but it's people that have been in or around"
21:05;21:07;"And they're trying to figure out how to re-transition"
21:07;21:08;"And not old"
21:08;21:09;"Yeah"
21:09;21:13;"But you know, there's a paradigm shift"
21:13;21:24;"Yeah, Elvis Costello is always interesting to me"
21:24;21:30;"And that Elvis Costello, that's a classic artist I got into via my dad's records"
21:30;21:33;"Because he had the first three Elvis records"
21:33;21:35;"I got really deep into them"
21:36;21:39;"And it was always interesting to me, like his first album"
21:39;21:41;"He's kind of associated with punk"
21:41;21:45;"But then the most famous song on that first album is ""Alison"""
21:45;21:46;"Like, throw in ""Alison"""
21:46;21:49;"""Alison"" is totally like a huge part of this wave"
21:49;21:50;"Trad wave"
21:50;21:52;"Yeah, trad wave"
21:52;21:59;"Yeah, Elvis Costello is one of those dudes that I really wanted to get into"
21:59;22:01;"And I felt like I needed to"
22:01;22:06;"Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl"
22:06;22:10;"And I love his hits"
22:10;22:14;"But like, I remember trying to listen to that first record, ""My Name Is True"""
22:14;22:15;"Yeah"
22:15;22:16;"A lot"
22:16;22:20;"And I was just like, I can't, I couldn't, I just couldn't get there"
22:20;22:21;"You like ""Alison""?"
22:21;22:21;"Oh, of course"
22:21;22:23;"I mean, this is incredible"
22:23;22:29;"I'm not gonna get too sentimental"
22:29;22:35;"I remember just like, really trying to listen to ""My Name Is True"" all the way through"
22:35;22:36;"And I just like, I couldn't do it"
22:36;22:39;"I mean, like, did you go deep on ""My Name Is True""?"
22:39;22:42;"Like, is that an album you know front to back?"
22:42;22:42;"Let me check"
22:42;22:44;"I have to look at it to know how well I know it"
22:44;22:50;"Brutal harmony, sorry guys"
22:51;22:59;"I know this world is killing you, oh, Alison"
22:59;23:00;"Yeah, I know this album pretty well"
23:00;23:05;"My name is true"
23:05;23:07;"You know, I have like a two and a half year old daughter"
23:07;23:11;"And like, so I've met a lot of parents of other kids"
23:11;23:14;"And like, this is one mom I've met named Alison"
23:14;23:19;"And I, every time I'm around her, I just have to make sure I'm not"
23:19;23:22;"I just, I want to just go, ""Alison"""
23:22;23:25;"I haven't done it yet, I haven't done it"
23:25;23:26;"But like"
23:26;23:27;"Holding back"
23:27;23:27;"I'm holding back"
23:27;23:32;"And then like, later that day, I'll just be like, walk around the house going like, ""Alison"""
23:32;23:38;"I can't stop you from talking when I hear the silly things that you say"
23:38;23:45;"I think somebody better put out the big light"
23:45;23:46;"'Cause I can't"
23:46;23:47;"You know ""Less Than Zero""?"
23:47;23:48;"Maybe if I heard it"
23:48;23:50;"You throw on ""Less Than Zero"""
23:50;23:54;"Oh, Alison"
23:54;24:03;"I always really liked this song"
24:03;24:05;"Is this song ""My Name is True""?"
24:05;24:05;"Yeah"
24:05;24:12;"I think Elvis Costello, ""Trad Wave"" is really a great, that's a great genre"
24:12;24:16;"I don't know if they all fit in this, but it describes it perfectly"
24:16;24:19;"Yeah, and I think it all started around '77"
24:19;24:20;"Nick Lowe's in that"
24:20;24:21;"Yep"
24:21;24:23;"Graham Parker"
24:23;24:24;"Oh yeah"
24:24;24:33;"Turn up the TV, no one, less than will suspect even"
24:33;24:37;"Your mother won't detect it, so your father won't know"
24:37;24:44;"They think that I got no respect, but everything means"
24:44;24:46;"Less than zero"
24:46;24:49;"Hit, hit"
24:49;24:52;"A little bit of throwback"
24:52;24:55;"Well, yeah, I mean, obviously it's ""Trad Wave"""
24:55;24:56;"I mean, what's a..."
24:56;24:59;"All right, speaking of ""Trad Wave"""
24:59;25:03;"So what's the first Tom Petty album?"
25:03;25:04;"What was his first hit?"
25:04;25:06;"""Damn the Torpedoes"""
25:06;25:07;"Is it ""Refugee""?"
25:07;25:08;"I think so"
25:08;25:10;"Matt's saying no"
25:10;25:11;"No, okay, hold on"
25:11;25:13;"First Tom Petty hit"
25:13;25:17;"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' first album came out in '76"
25:17;25:18;"Oh, ""Breakdown"" and ""American Girl"""
25:18;25:20;"So throw in ""Breakdown"""
25:20;25:23;"The first Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' single, ""Breakdown"""
25:23;25:25;"That was kind of their first hit"
25:25;25:28;"The first single, he's using that weird voice"
25:28;25:31;"It's okay if you..."
25:31;25:36;"See, this sounds like Fleetwood Mac to me"
25:36;25:40;"I do want to say thematically Tom Petty is ""Trad Wave"""
25:40;25:44;"Sound-wise or not, thematically, he's ""Trad"""
25:44;25:46;"To me, this is total ""Trad Wave"""
25:46;25:47;"This is like..."

29:10;29:13;"Like the difference between like ""Trad Wave"" and just being nostalgic"
29:13;29:14;"Like nostalgia music"
29:14;29:19;"Well, nostalgia is an element of the newly found genre ""Trad Wave"""
29:19;29:25;"But specifically ""Trad Wave"" is dudes making music in the punk and new wave era"
29:25;29:30;"who were a little too traditional to go all the way punk"
29:30;29:33;"So it's like, it's this classic rock music"
29:33;29:34;"Like obviously ""American Girl"""
29:34;29:37;"The energy of the drums could be punk"
29:37;29:41;"But it's like just a little too soft to truly call it punk"
29:41;29:44;"Or Elvis Costello has like a punk attitude"
29:44;29:46;"And he'd had some like punky energetic songs"
29:46;29:50;"But you know, the fact that ""Alison"" is one of his first hits, very traditional"
29:50;29:53;"And then Steve Forbert, just like these really kind of"
29:53;29:57;"clean, minimalist, produced songs"
29:57;29:58;"I mean, yeah"
29:58;30:00;"And ""Dire Straits"" is like the epitome, it's like they're so weird"
30:00;30:05;"That they're just, they don't really fit in with the bands of that era"
30:05;30:09;"Even the fact that their first song, their first hit ""Souls of Swing"""
30:09;30:11;"Is like about watching like a jazz band play"
30:11;30:15;"And he's like ripping these kind of finger-picked solos"

30:19;30:23;"I feel like we were, you know, it's really, it's definitely like"
30:23;30:27;"Steve Forbert, Elvis Costello"
30:27;30:30;"I don't know if Petty's ""Trad Wave"""
30:30;30:33;"I feel like this is gonna be an ongoing project"
30:33;30:35;"I know what you mean, but it's like"
30:35;30:38;"[Laughter]"
30:38;30:39;"Listeners weigh in"
30:39;30:40;"Yeah, what are we talking about?"
30:40;30:43;"We're kind of vague here"
30:43;30:46;"We're kind of vague here, but if you know, you know"
30:46;30:48;"It's classic rock that is post-punk"
30:48;30:55;"That is either deliberately or not, it's influenced by the cultural zeitgeists"
30:55;30:57;"And the technology of the era"
30:57;31:01;"And so if the police were making a record"
31:01;31:04;"Or Steve Forbert was making a record in 1973"
31:04;31:10;"It wouldn't sound the way it does when they made their records in the late 70s"
31:10;31:14;"There's that touch of punk new wave influence in the production"
31:14;31:19;"But ultimately, I think these are all guys who they liked old music"
31:19;31:24;"And then when punk and new wave started, they were kind of psyched"
31:24;31:26;"Because it's like, all right, back to some simple rock and roll"
31:26;31:29;"It's not progressive rock, it's not yacht rock"
31:29;31:34;"And they could do something kind of simple with those kind of late 70s drums"
31:34;31:36;"Honestly, it seems simple"
31:36;31:41;"Either it's people that are trying to transition into new wave"
31:41;31:43;"And can't totally let go"
31:43;31:45;"But new wave doesn't exist yet"
31:45;31:48;"No, or no, I understand"
31:48;31:52;"But there's probably a cultural sentiment, like the zeitgeist is changing"
31:53;31:57;"Well, also there were some people who used punk and new wave interchangeably"
31:57;32:00;"I think as early as like '76, '77"
32:00;32:04;"Just to refer to this new energetic youth music"
32:04;32:08;"Before there was like full-on synthy MTV new wave"
32:08;32:12;"Look, the question is, we all know there's something"
32:12;32:18;"That Steve Forbert, Dire Straits, Tom Petty, Elvis Costello"
32:18;32:20;"They're all spiritually connected"
32:20;32:22;"What is that connection?"
32:22;32:23;"And what do you call it?"
32:23;32:24;"That's what we're asking"
32:24;32:27;"So if you're still with your family on Thanksgiving"
32:27;32:31;"Gather your aunts and your uncles, your grandparents"
32:31;32:33;"Ask the kids"
32:33;32:36;"Kids say the darndest things"
32:36;32:38;"You never know, you might ask your little, you know"
32:38;32:41;"Precocious 11-year-old niece or nephew"
32:41;32:48;"Can you explain the spiritual connection between Petty Forbert, Costello, and Knopfler?"
32:48;32:51;"And I throw Billy Joel in there"
32:51;32:53;"Anthony's song ""Movin' Out"" I throw that in there"
32:53;32:56;"Yeah, maybe a touch of Billy Joel"
32:56;33:00;"I don't think he's quite in the inner circle of Tradwith"
33:00;33:03;"But there's something spiritually connected about these people"
33:03;33:07;"And I'm sure with time we could find more songs and albums"
33:07;33:11;"That were these, had that '79 sound"
33:11;33:13;"You know what it is?"
33:13;33:16;"I think, and I bet we can find out examples of this, right?"
33:16;33:18;"Like in every cultural shift"
33:18;33:21;"It's people that are open and want to move on"
33:21;33:23;"And they're forward-thinking"
33:23;33:25;"They don't want to let, totally let go of the past"
33:25;33:27;"You know, there's like a lot"
33:27;33:30;"I think that that's really the tie that binds"
33:30;33:31;"Or people that go, you know what?"
33:31;33:32;"I'm really"
33:32;33:34;"Are they radical centrists?"
33:34;33:39;"I think that there's a certain person that's really, that wants to"
33:39;33:41;"Walk through the door"
33:41;33:44;"But is also, hey guys, we don't need to let go of the past"
33:45;33:47;"You know, there was some good, there was some good sh*t there"
33:47;33:51;"Okay, here's, I don't get the sense that those artists are like"
33:51;33:53;"Hanging on to the past, I just"
33:53;33:55;"No, it's not hanging on"
33:55;33:58;"It's just an appreciation for, you know, as everyone's like, you know what?"
33:58;34:00;"Because I think that you get a new movement"
34:00;34:01;"And everyone goes, you know what?"
34:01;34:02;"Like, that's it"
34:02;34:05;"We draw the line there"
34:05;34:06;"We're doing something new"
34:06;34:08;"And there's a certain group, you'll go"
34:08;34:09;"Yeah, I'm into that, guys"
34:09;34:13;"But I also appreciate a certain kind of tone, melody"
34:13;34:17;"I want it, you know, let's not like, let's not forget"
34:17;34:19;"Like, there's still like a lot to offer"
34:19;34:20;"That's all I'm saying"
34:20;34:22;"And that feels like the artist you're talking about"
34:22;34:23;"You know what?"
34:23;34:25;"It's also the people who are not true believers"
34:25;34:31;"It's like, whenever you see footage of like, original punk shows"
34:31;34:34;"You have these images, mostly from the UK"
34:34;34:37;"Of like, just people like spitting on each other"
34:37;34:38;"And crazy punk rockers"
34:38;34:41;"And you see them going crazy at the front of the stage"
34:41;34:42;"But you gotta remember"
34:42;34:44;"That's only the front of the venue"
34:44;34:49;"The whole back half was filled with long-haired music critics"
34:49;34:52;"Who were kind of taking it all in and being like"
34:52;34:53;"This is quite interesting"
34:53;34:54;"You know what I mean?"
34:54;34:55;"Who didn't have mohawks"
34:55;35:00;"And who were like, 29, not 15"
35:00;35:03;"And picture, especially in New York at CBGBs or something"
35:03;35:07;"You might have had some like, real like, real OG punk rockers"
35:07;35:10;"But then you're just gonna have, you're gonna just have like"
35:10;35:14;"You know, people who lived uptown coming down and checking it out"
35:14;35:15;"You're gonna have like, Robert Criscow"
35:15;35:18;"And like, you know, those types of people"
35:18;35:21;"There would be like, a lot of people who didn't remotely look punk rock"
35:21;35:22;"Just kind of taking it all in"
35:22;35:23;"So to me, it's kind of like"
35:23;35:28;"Something explosive like punk happens"
35:28;35:31;"And you're gonna have people right at the center of it"
35:31;35:33;"And then you're gonna have these people adjacent to it"
35:33;35:36;"Who are not gonna throw away all their old records"
35:36;35:40;"Or pretend that, oh, like, pretend that this is year zero"
35:40;35:43;"You know, there's probably somebody who moved to New York"
35:43;35:48;"From the Midwest or the South, like Steve Forbert in 1977"
35:48;35:51;"And they were just like, I shaved my head"
35:51;35:53;"I threw out all my old clothes and I burned my old records"
35:53;35:55;"It was year zero"
35:55;35:57;"I fully reinvented myself"
35:57;35:59;"And then other people who are gonna stand in the back of the venue"
35:59;36:02;"And watch the Ramones or something and be like"
36:02;36:03;"Hey, that's far out, man"
36:03;36:08;"Anyway, you wanna go see Dylan at the Beacon Theater on Sunday?"
36:08;36:10;"You know, like a normal person"
36:10;36:14;"This is just normal people music"
36:14;36:19;"Wait, here's a song that maybe could be part of the conversation"
36:19;36:21;"From 1979"
36:21;36:23;"""My Sharona"" by The Knack"
36:23;36:27;"It's just one of those songs that's like, it's not really punk"
36:27;36:32;"But of course, it's very influenced by the punk new wave energy"
36:32;36:33;"Throw in ""My Sharona"""
36:52;36:56;"Oh, my little pretty one, my pretty one"
36:56;36:59;"When you gonna give me some tight Sharona?"
36:59;37:02;"Oh, you make my motor run, my motor run"
37:02;37:04;"Gun it, coming off of the line"
37:04;37:06;"My Sharona"
37:06;37:08;"Never gonna stop, give it up"
37:08;37:10;"Such a dirty mind, I always get it up"
37:10;37:13;"All the time, I'm in the hood, I ain't around"
37:13;37:15;"Yeah, for sure, definitely not punk"
37:15;37:15;"Yeah, whoa"
37:16;37:18;"My, my, my, my Sharona"
37:22;37:24;"Come a little closer, huh"
37:24;37:25;"I'll be a hunk"
37:25;37:27;"Close enough to look in my eyes"
37:27;37:28;"My Sharona"
37:28;37:30;"Keep it in a mystery"
37:30;37:31;"This is '79?"
37:31;37:31;"Yeah"
37:31;37:36;"Well, then to go fully like cyclical with the generations"
37:36;37:38;"Do you know the Ted Kennedy songs ""Pull My Strings""?"
37:38;37:39;"Oh, yeah"
37:39;37:43;"Which is like a send up of ""My Sharona"""
37:43;37:45;"Pull my strings and riffs"
37:45;37:48;"My, my, my, my Sharona"
37:49;37:51;"My, my, my, my Sharona"
38:03;38:07;"Yeah, like this is also just sounds like early The Kinks"
38:07;38:09;"It's got some punk energy, but it's not"
38:09;38:09;"Yeah"
38:09;38:10;"It's not that punk"
38:10;38:10;"Kinks wouldn't have gone"
38:10;38:12;"Ba-na-ba-ba"
38:12;38:13;"Yeah"
38:13;38:14;"But this part is great, yeah"
38:20;38:21;"This is a pretty Elvis-gustella"
38:21;38:23;"All right, let's move on from Trad Wave"
38:23;38:24;"Look, we tried"
38:24;38:26;"We tried to invent a new genre"
38:26;38:27;"We maybe didn't knock it out of the park"
38:27;38:29;"This is R&D"
38:29;38:31;"Research and development"
38:31;38:33;"Yeah, it's an ongoing convo"
38:33;38:36;"Late 70s, early 80s"
38:36;38:38;"It's a transitional time"
38:38;38:41;"Actually, throw in Romeo's tune, Steve Forbert, one more time"
38:41;38:44;"I just want to listen to it as we wrap up our Trad Wave segment"
38:44;38:47;"And just have him have all these thoughts, hear it again"
39:01;39:02;"Yes, Trad Wave"
39:05;39:07;"Meet me in the middle of the day"
39:07;39:09;"Let me hear you say everything's okay"
39:09;39:13;"Bring me southern kisses from your room"
39:15;39:17;"Meet me in the middle of the night"
39:17;39:18;"Let me hear you say everything's okay"
39:18;39:21;"This could almost be from like the early 70s"
39:21;39:23;"Almost like a James Taylor song"
39:23;39:25;"And yet it's just got a sprinkle"
39:25;39:27;"A sprinkle of that Trad Wave"
39:27;39:29;"That late 70s Trad Wave"
39:29;39:30;"It might be that drum sound"
39:30;39:31;"I don't know what it"
39:31;39:32;"Yeah, there's a lot of things"
39:32;39:35;"It's an ineffable zeitgeist"
39:35;39:38;"While further down behind the masquerade"
39:38;39:39;"The tears are there"
39:39;39:43;"I don't ask for all that much"
39:43;39:48;"I just want someone to care"
39:48;39:50;"That's right, girl"
39:50;39:52;"Meet me in the middle of the day"
39:52;39:54;"Let me hear you say everything's okay"
39:54;39:57;"Come on out beneath the shining sun"
40:00;40:02;"Meet me in the middle of the night"
40:02;40:04;"Let me hear you say everything's all right"
40:04;40:07;"Sneak on out beneath the stars and run"
40:20;40:21;"So moving on"
40:21;40:26;"Our next segment maybe isn't a million miles away from Trad Wave"
40:26;40:32;"We've been meaning to talk about this guy for a long time on Time Crisis"
40:32;40:34;"His name is Andrew Gold"
40:35;40:37;"And he has a very interesting career"
40:37;40:40;"And a lot of people don't know his name"
40:40;40:42;"He's not around anymore"
40:42;40:43;"He died in 2011"
40:43;40:49;"He was an American multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and record producer"
40:49;40:54;"Who influenced much of the Los Angeles-dominated pop/soft rock sound in the 1970s"
40:54;40:57;"So he played on all sorts of other people's records"
40:57;40:58;"He produced stuff"
40:58;41:02;"But here's what he's best known for as a solo artist"
41:03;41:06;"'77 he had a top 40 hit with ""Lonely Boy"""
41:06;41:09;"And then in '78 he had ""Thank You For Being A Friend"""
41:09;41:10;"And if you're anything like me"
41:10;41:14;"You know ""Thank You For Being A Friend"" as being the Golden Girls theme"
41:14;41:19;"But did you know that well before it was the Golden Girls theme"
41:19;41:24;"It was a single released by Andrew Gold"
41:24;41:29;"I would have sworn that it was, that that song was just"
41:29;41:32;"Written for the Golden Girls"
41:32;41:33;"It just seems like it"
41:33;41:39;"But actually no, it was like a minor hit single for one Andrew Gold in 1978"
41:39;41:40;"So let's throw it on"
41:40;41:43;"This is the original ""Thank You For Being A Friend"""
41:43;41:48;"It reached number 25 on the charts in '78"

50:50;50:56;"So Andrew Gold, we've listened to two of his best known songs as a solo artist"
50:56;51:01;"but there's a song that some of you might know that he released in the 90s"
51:01;51:04;"and it's wildly different"
51:04;51:06;"So maybe you've heard Lonely Boy"
51:06;51:08;"You've probably heard Thank You For Being A Friend"
51:08;51:10;"at least the Golden Girls version"

51:30;51:31;"The children love it"
51:31;51:34;"You hear it at Halloween"
51:34;51:38;"This is just something that he was doing later in life, making some children's music"
51:38;51:43;"In '96, he released an album called Halloween Howls Fun and Scary Music"
51:43;51:48;"and he created this song which, according to Rolling Stone,"
51:48;51:50;"is the official Halloween song of Generation Z"
51:50;51:52;"So check this out"
51:52;51:54;"Spooky Scary Skeletons"

52:17;52:18;"Do you know this song, Jake?"
52:18;52:19;"I don't"
52:19;52:21;"Do you know it?"
52:21;52:23;"I heard it via my child"
52:24;52:24;"Same"
52:24;52:30;"You'll shake and shudder in surprise when you hear these zombies shriek"
52:30;52:34;"We're so sorry, skeletons"
52:34;52:37;"You gotta understand, Jake, this song is like"
52:37;52:38;"This is a pretty Paul McCartney here"
52:38;52:39;"Yeah, exactly"
52:39;52:41;"You can't hold Andrew Gold down"
52:41;52:43;"He's always gonna bring some music out"
52:43;52:43;"Oh yeah"
52:43;52:47;"He's going full like Ram era McCartney here"
52:47;52:51;"This song is like Monster Mash for the Zoomers"
52:51;52:52;"Really?"
52:52;52:55;"And they hear it on like TikTok and stuff?"
52:55;52:58;"Yeah, and then there's also there's a dance remix"
52:58;52:59;"Do we have that one, Matt?"
52:59;53:01;"God, that's so funny"
53:01;53:03;"But hold on, but Ezra, your child isn't"

53:04;53:08;"But your child isn't listening to or watching TikTok"
53:08;53:09;"So where are they hearing this?"
53:09;53:13;"I've given my child unfettered access to TikTok essentially since birth"
53:18;53:21;"In this competitive media environment, you can never start them too young"
53:29;53:30;"I just think it's out there"
53:30;53:32;"Somebody else probably played it for him"
53:32;53:38;"Somebody probably threw on a Halloween playlist at school or at a friend's house"
53:46;53:51;"Wow, this episode might be like the worst music we've ever played on this show"
54:05;54:07;"And you know what's going to only get worse when we start"
54:07;54:09;"listening to the Grammy nominations for best rock song"
54:19;54:23;"I guess I like this as a late career move for Andrew Gold"
54:27;54:31;"Wait, do you have"
54:31;54:38;"Is there a band called the Fraternal Order of the All on Apple Music?"
54:38;54:42;"He recorded a psychedelic 60s tribute album"
54:42;54:46;"Greetings from Planet Love under the pseudonym the Fraternal Order of the All"
54:46;54:49;"Releasing it on his own label Q-Brain Records"
54:49;54:50;"Q-Brain"
54:50;54:57;"I want to hear Andrew Gold's 1990s tribute to the 1960s"
54:57;54:58;"Yeah, I'd love to hear that"
54:58;54:59;"Through the looking glass here"
55:19;55:21;"Not gonna lie if you told me this was Foxygen"
55:23;55:25;"I'd be like, yeah"
55:27;55:29;"Yeah, Foxygen, poor Steve"
55:36;55:41;"I saw Foxygen play at the Roxy in like 2013"
55:41;55:42;"Pretty good show"
55:42;55:42;"Nice"
55:47;55:49;"I mean, he's a consummate musician"
55:49;55:50;"Yeah, he's the best"
55:50;55:56;"Like, he's having some fun, but you can hear in his voicings"
55:56;55:58;"He knows his stuff"
55:58;56:02;"He's like, let me like try to do like a magical mystery kind of thing in 1996"
56:10;56:12;"Oh yeah, he knows McCartney inside and out"
56:17;56:21;"Beautiful Capricorn, what?"
56:27;56:32;"I feel like he had like a Mad Libs of like 1960s words, like Capricorn, Rainbow"
56:32;56:34;"Hold on, we need to listen to one more thing"
56:34;56:36;"First of all, I just want to-"
56:36;56:37;"That was rough"
56:37;56:40;"Yeah, it's a bit rough, but that was like some, you know, late-"
56:40;56:41;"He was just messing around"
56:41;56:42;"Yeah, no, I mean, respect"
56:42;56:44;"I mean, the thing about-"
56:44;56:45;"That's the-"
56:45;56:48;"Dude, that is the most obscure music maybe we've ever-"
56:48;56:49;"I've ever heard in my life"
56:49;56:55;"1990s Andrew Gold tribute to the 1960s"
56:56;56:58;"Like that's the true obscure stuff, man"
56:58;57:01;"I want to say, because in the first one, we were like, oh, he just probably brought in all of these"
57:01;57:05;"Hollywood, you know, session guys"
57:05;57:07;"This was a solo affair"
57:07;57:07;"Oh yeah"
57:07;57:08;"He's playing everything"
57:08;57:09;"He played everything"
57:09;57:10;"This is a-"
57:10;57:13;"He is all the instruments, all tracks"
57:13;57:16;"Dude, don't come at me with like your 70s Japanese psych rock"
57:16;57:22;"Let's talk, talk to me when you've like really explored the Andrew Gold 1990s,"
57:22;57:27;"like 1960s pastiche music that he recorded in his apartment in Burbank"
57:27;57:32;"I mean, the truth is, Jake, I imagine it's with semi-regularity"
57:32;57:37;"that you probably do meet a person, probably a dude,"
57:37;57:42;"who collects obscure psychedelic records"
57:42;57:48;"and you actually could hit them with like, I know a good one from, it's from '97"
57:48;57:49;"Like what?"
57:50;57:56;"Be like, yeah, the fraternal order of the all, greetings from planet love"
57:56;57:59;"They don't have a Wikipedia page, by the way"
57:59;58:00;"Check it out"
58:00;58:01;"It's that deep"
58:01;58:03;"The thing I like about Andrew Gold is just like,"
58:03;58:12;"I do think it's the true test of a songwriter when they can do stuff in different moods"
58:12;58:13;"and different genres"
58:13;58:17;"And I do think, we all agree, Lonely Boy is a great song"
58:18;58:21;"But even if that's the only Andrew Gold song you truly like,"
58:21;58:27;"you got to give it up for him that he wrote these two insanely different other songs,"
58:27;58:30;"Thank You For Being A Friend and Spooky Scary Skeletons,"
58:30;58:33;"that all had a life of their own in various ways"
58:33;58:35;"It's rare, you know?"
58:35;58:36;"For sure"
58:36;58:40;"If of course you got like your Billy Joel's, just like these hit makers,"
58:40;58:46;"but then, you know, somebody who is like a talented engineer, producer, something"
58:46;58:49;"They'd be lucky to have one of those things, let alone all three"
58:49;58:51;"That's the Gold Triple Crown"
58:51;58:55;"If you can make a legitimately solid song,"
58:55;58:59;"one that becomes the theme to a show,"
58:59;59:04;"and one that becomes a beloved holiday song for children,"
59:04;59:06;"that's Triple Gold"
59:06;59:07;"And very few people accomplish that"
59:07;59:13;"This guy's literally got boomers, Gen X, Gen Z, locked"
59:13;59:16;"Yeah, think about that for a second"
59:16;59:24;"He had a song in Boogie Nights made by a classic Gen Xer like Paul Thomas Anderson"
59:24;59:28;"And then he had a song for Golden Girls"
59:28;59:30;"I mean, they're the greatest generation"
59:30;59:33;"Those are people who are old in the 80s"
59:33;59:38;"I mean, he's really, he's spanning the decades"
59:38;59:42;"The last thing I would just want to check out, I've never actually heard this,"
59:42;59:47;"but he started a new wave band in the 80s called Wax,"
59:47;59:51;"and it was him teaming up with Graham Goldman from 10cc"
59:51;59:53;"Interesting"
59:53;59:56;"So, can we listen to Bridge to Your Heart by Wax?"
59:56;01:00:01;"In the US, they were known as Wax UK"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Wow"
01:00:04;01:00:15;"Oh, this is sick"
01:00:15;01:00:42;"Yeah, a little bit of wham"
01:00:42;01:00:54;"I couldn't see"
01:00:54;01:01:13;"it"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"It's an incredible album cover"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"Which album?"
01:01:16;01:01:21;"This album, the Wax album cover, I couldn't even describe it if I wanted to"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"It's so well designed"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Ezra"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"This is incredible"
01:01:28;01:01:34;"For the American English album cover"
01:01:34;01:01:40;"I love these album titles, Magnetic Heaven in American English"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"Oh yeah"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"American English is a tight"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"It's interesting, very cool collage"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"All right, this is solid"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Okay, you know what?"
01:01:48;01:01:54;"And actually, now truly, this is the final thing we have to talk about with Andrew Gold"
01:01:54;01:01:57;"This guy's such a fascinating career"
01:01:57;01:02:05;"Apparently, Andrew Gold played guitar on the classic Bob Dylan song,"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"Every Grain of Sand off Shot of Love"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"You know that song, Jake?"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Yeah"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I guess this is Andrew Gold"
01:02:12;01:02:12;"Wow"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"For anybody who doesn't know, this is a beautiful Bob song"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Some people don't like this album"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"This is the one with Brownsville Girl?"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"No, no, that's Knocked Out, Loaded"
01:02:27;01:02:27;"Oh yeah"
01:02:27;01:02:36;"I get those mid-80s ones confused"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"This was his final Christian record of the Christian trilogy"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"Oh, right, right, right, right, right, of course"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"This album is cool"
01:02:44;01:02:49;"But I think even for some people who don't like this album, this song stands out"
01:02:49;01:02:52;"Because it's just like a really pretty, deep ballad"
01:02:52;01:02:57;"And actually, I think Bob's been closing his shows with it lately"
01:02:57;01:02:57;"Really?"
01:02:57;01:03:08;"Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake"
01:03:09;01:03:17;"Well I can't, I know, behold this chain of events that I must break"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"I wonder if Andrew Gold and Bob even exchanged many words"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"Or Bob's just like, ""I need a guitarist"""
01:03:23;01:03:25;"And he'd happen to be in the studio or something"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"Bob was in Burbank"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"Yeah, Bob in Burbank"
01:03:29;01:03:34;"I'm picturing Andrew Gold just never leaving the Burbank, LA area"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"It's not true, he spent a bunch of time in England"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"Oh, that's true, with Wax"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Shout out to Andrew Gold"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"On this Thanksgiving weekend"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"On this Thanksgiving weekend, rest in peace"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"You had a very cool career"
01:03:47;01:03:53;"And I hope some TC heads who never heard his name before"
01:03:53;01:04:01;"Will remember the name Andrew Gold next time they hear any of these fascinating songs"
01:04:03;01:04:10;"To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay"
01:04:10;01:04:19;"I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry maze"
01:04:19;01:04:27;"And every time I pass that way I always hear my name"
01:04:29;01:04:36;"Then onward in my journey I come to understand"
01:04:36;01:04:45;"That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand"
01:05:57;01:06:05;"I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night"
01:06:05;01:06:13;"In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintery light"
01:06:13;01:06:21;"In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space"
01:06:21;01:06:29;"In the broken fear of innocence on each forgotten face"
01:06:29;01:06:37;"I hear the aging footsteps like the motion of the sea"
01:06:37;01:06:45;"Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me"
01:06:45;01:06:55;"Well, this has definitely been one of the more random episodes of Time Crisis, but maybe they're all pretty random, is the truth."
01:06:55;01:07:06;"It weirdly makes sense to go from Steve Forbert to Andrew Gold to one of the famously random category in the Grammys, which is Best Rock Song."
01:07:06;01:07:12;"And we've enjoyed talking about the nominees for Best Rock Song in the past."
01:07:12;01:07:20;"Last year we went through it, and this year we're going to do it again, because the Grammys just released all their nominations."
01:07:20;01:07:23;"Congratulations to all the nominees."
01:07:23;01:07:32;"And at Time Crisis, we talk a lot about rock music, and we're going to go deep on the nominees for Best Rock Song."
01:07:32;01:07:39;"And to be fair to the Grammys, rock is a strange category."
01:07:39;01:07:44;"I don't think rock is played out anymore, dawg, by the way, as Jake was famously told."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Actually, I've got a question for you, Jake."
01:07:46;01:07:51;"When were you eating burritos with a guy and he said, ""Rock's played out, dawg."" What year was that?"
01:07:51;01:07:54;"I'm going to guess 2013."
01:07:54;01:08:00;"Ten years later. Anything that's super played out one year, ten years later, it can't be as played out."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"That's just the nature."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"True."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"The pendulum swings."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"The pendulum's got to swing."
01:08:06;01:08:15;"So if 2013 was when rock was really feeling played out, you know, because also there's nothing new under the sun."
01:08:15;01:08:22;"So rock gets played out, sure, but that's because people are more excited about pop and rap and whatever at that moment."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"Understandably, I was there."
01:08:25;01:08:28;"But then that stuff gets played out too."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"You know?"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"I'm just having this Proustian reverie over here."
01:08:34;01:08:41;"I'm just recollecting my having my like this day job I had in 2013 and my co-worker, Matt,"
01:08:41;01:08:46;"we're sitting at these outdoor picnic tables just crushing Chipotle burritos."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Talk about rock music."
01:08:48;01:08:53;"And someone inevitably went, ""So what's like the new stuff you guys are into?"""
01:08:53;01:09:03;"And I was like, ""I don't know, war on drugs or something?"" And then this guy Matt just wails into this bite of this chicken pre-dinner and goes, ""Rock's played out, dog."""
01:09:03;01:09:07;"I can picture it so vividly."
01:09:07;01:09:13;"It's about the way you say it. It's like in the movie, is he going to be played by Danny McBride?"
01:09:13;01:09:21;"Well, no, but he's more of like an art school guy, you know, like an art school Danny McBride kind of guy, if that makes any sense."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Rock's played out, dog."
01:09:23;01:09:26;"It's the dog that gives me Danny McBride."
01:09:26;01:09:34;"Just like, ""Rock's played out, dog. I gotta burn you some CDs of some of the trap I've been listening to, man. It's gonna blow your freaking mind."""
01:09:34;01:09:41;"Choice nugs. Choice crime mob nugs."
01:09:41;01:09:47;"I also just love the idea of, this is not Matt, but I'm now just picturing the Danny McBride version."
01:09:47;01:10:02;"Just some dude who's like 37 and just telling his friend, ""Rock's played out, dog. You gotta check out some of these TikTok remixes, man. This shit's fire. This shit's on heat, man."
01:10:02;01:10:12;"You gotta check out some of the new pop stuff, man. It's f*cking slaps, bro. Dubstep, trap, that's my sh*t."""
01:10:12;01:10:17;"A guy that's a little too old to be using the new slang."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Yeah."
01:10:18;01:10:21;"I'm gonna make you a playlist of my favorite Diplo."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"Actually, I think the dubstep is probably the most accurate."
01:10:24;01:10:32;"There's definitely a dude who's maybe even like a hippie dude, because you know like some hippies got more into dubstep and they kind of left behind the jam scene?"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"Actually, that's news to me, but okay."
01:10:35;01:10:46;"There's a kind of like druggy dubstep scene, and I can just like totally picture a dude who's just like, ""You out here still listening to f*cking rock and roll, dog? That sh*t's played out, man. It's all about dubstep."""
01:10:46;01:10:55;"That conversation definitely happened in 2013. A dude being like, ""You out here still f*cking listening to guitar solos, bro? I'm gonna listen to dubstep, waiting for the drop."
01:10:55;01:11:07;"Man, you gotta come out with me sometime, bro. It's sick. You go see some of these DJs, you wait for the drop. When the drop hits, man, it's better than f*cking Eddie Van Halen on 'Eruption,' man. That sh*t's so..."""
01:11:07;01:11:10;"I know that conversation happened."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"""Yo, dog, chill on the guac."""
01:11:16;01:11:25;"Just like a dude digging into- grabbing chips and digging into his friend's guacamole that he didn't pay for."
01:11:25;01:11:38;"He got a picture, just the context is Chipotle. It's a Chipotle lunch at work, and a bunch of guys in their late 30s, early 40s."
01:11:38;01:11:41;"They've all split the guac."
01:11:41;01:11:51;"I'm picturing this dude being kind of a dirtbag, too. It's just like, ""Guac for the table? I'm good, bro. I'll just pay for my burrito."""
01:11:51;01:11:54;"Then he's just like, slamming at the table."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"Just going off about, ""Rock's played out, man."""
01:11:58;01:12:06;"You're like, ""Well, what about 'War on Drugs?' I don't f*cking listen to any rock, dog. Check out some dubstep. Get with the future, man. I'll burn you some CDs."""
01:12:06;01:12:13;"That dude 100% existed in 2013."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Oh, yeah. I worked with him."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"Okay, but I don't know what your guy was into, per se."
01:12:18;01:12:24;"He might have just been astutely noting that rock was beginning to feel a bit played out, which it was, fair enough."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"I don't think he was even that astute. I think it was pretty straight up."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"Yeah, and that doesn't mean that he was excited about anything else."
01:12:31;01:12:38;"That's also just like an aging person thing, being like, ""Yeah, I don't know. This stuff I like is not popular anymore. What are you going to do?"""
01:12:38;01:12:43;"And that is the question. What are you going to do? Are you going to get really excited about dubstep?"
01:12:43;01:12:47;"No, man. You're going to listen to '70s Gene Clark records."
01:12:47;01:12:56;"Yeah, because here's the thing about if you're into the taste of a palette of '70s rock, you can always slice that onion a tiny bit thinner and find the tiny..."
01:12:56;01:13:03;"Slice that garlic, dude. Goodfellas style, man. Paper thin. It just tastes like salt in olive oil."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Oh, you thought you understood the whole thing?"
01:13:05;01:13:13;"Well, we can just shave you off a translucent piece of garlic just to get even that tiny layer that you didn't know about."
01:13:13;01:13:19;"Let me break off some Steve Forbert for you, bro, because... Oh, you don't know? Okay."
01:13:19;01:13:25;"Basically, there's a fork in the road. At a certain point, you've already listened to all the big stuff, and you've got a choice."
01:13:25;01:13:30;"Either you're going to be getting a Steve Forbert or you're going to get into dubstep. The choice is yours."
01:13:30;01:13:34;"Or listening to people talk about politics on podcasts."
01:13:34;01:13:42;"Oh, yeah. That's so harsh. Honestly, I don't keep up with contemporary music. I mostly listen to political podcasts."
01:13:42;01:13:46;"I mean, welcome to middle age."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"That's the realest thing."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Yeah."
01:13:49;01:13:53;"Is that most people, when rock was played out, they tapped out."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"Yep."
01:13:54;01:13:58;"And it is full on Pod Save America."
01:13:58;01:14:09;"There are three forks in the road. You can either get into Steve Forbert, Andrew Gold, Pod Save America, or dubstep."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"I'm going Forbert."
01:14:10;01:14:13;"I'm going Forbert. Forbert and Gold."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"So dark. So dark."
01:14:15;01:14:21;"I'm going Forbert, dude. Forbert full discography."
01:14:21;01:14:27;"Honestly, I bet Steve Forbert, I bet there's a lot of good stuff in his whole discography."
01:14:27;01:14:30;"He seems like the type of dude who'll have some songs."
01:14:30;01:14:33;"I bet there is. I'll say these Grammy noms."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"Okay. Time for the Grammy noms."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Rock is officially not played out anymore."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"We're back."
01:14:39;01:14:46;"We're back. Ten years later. I'm sorry. I'm not saying it's back back, but it's not played out anymore."
01:14:46;01:14:54;"All right. Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The Grammy Award for Best Rock Song has been a category since 1992 and is awarded to the songwriters."
01:14:54;01:14:58;"Right. The people wrote the song, not necessarily the performers."
01:14:58;01:15:03;"Sting won the first award in 1992 for The Soul Cages."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Memorable."
01:15:05;01:15:14;"You know, I think of rock music in 1992. I'm thinking Sting solo material."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"It always takes a minute for them to catch up."
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Yeah."
01:15:18;01:15:26;"Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl and Pat Smear, the latter two being of the Foo Fighters, hold the record for most wins in this category."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"All right. That sounds about right."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"The Foo Fighters suck so bad."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Whoa."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"I can't believe they've won even one Grammy."
01:15:34;01:15:39;"They're the most mid band of all time."
01:15:39;01:15:45;"They're just, I can't stand the Foo Fighters, man. They're probably my least favorite band of all time."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"I like Nine Inch Nails more than the Foo Fighters."
01:15:48;01:15:55;"Okay. Because at least Nine Inch Nails had at least a little bit of originality and some sort of like actually transgressive aesthetic."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Foo Fighters, bottom of the barrel."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"Oh, man."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Man, Jake has turned on."
01:16:01;01:16:07;"I'm two whiskeys deep, guys. It's a Wednesday night. I'm 46. I'm drinking whiskey."
01:16:07;01:16:09;"And you hate the Foo Fighters."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"I'm screaming into a laptop right now."
01:16:12;01:16:16;"You know, I'm speaking my truth."
01:16:16;01:16:23;"Wow. I mean, wait, Jake, I thought we discussed that you had a soft spot for like early Foo Fighters."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"Okay. There's that one song."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Big Me."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Yeah. That song's cool."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Like it's kind of like a Lemonhead song or something."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"When I talk about it."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"It's like a little bit twee."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Yeah, it's a good song."
01:16:35;01:16:40;"And then Dave Grohl grew that goatee and he just went like full like sports bar butt rock."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"You don't like Everlong?"
01:16:41;01:16:46;"Is that the one that goes, ""There goes my hero."""
01:16:46;01:16:47;"No."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Is that Everlong?"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"It's called, ""There goes my hero."""
01:16:50;01:16:58;"Everybody, it's David Letterman's favorite song. It goes, ""Everything will never be this good forever."""
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Oh, yeah. Brutal."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"Wait, why is that David Letterman's favorite song?"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"I thought David Letterman was a Warren Zevon fan."
01:17:05;01:17:09;"I thought it was like, ""Oh, Letterman's got good taste. He's a Zevon head."""
01:17:09;01:17:12;"Yo, actually, by the way, I'm not just saying this."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"David Letterman is like a trad wave guy."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"He's trad wave comedy."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Yeah, he's right in that era."
01:17:19;01:17:28;"Exactly. Because he came out like early 80s downtown New York, but he's got his kind of like Midwestern aw shucks, but like secretly dark comedy."
01:17:28;01:17:31;"And slightly throwback-y, but with a wig."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"Exactly. Because he would come out and be like, you know, from a..."
01:17:34;01:17:40;"He's always talking about like being from Indiana, but he's doing this weird New York City late night show."
01:17:40;01:17:46;"I totally could see David Letterman really liking Steve Forbert."
01:17:46;01:17:56;"I don't know why it's David Letterman's favorite song, but I seem to recall that when David Letterman had a heart surgery or something and he came back to do his show again,"
01:17:56;01:18:01;"he like requested that the Foo Fighters do Everlong because it's his favorite song."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"That's so dark."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Throw on Everlong."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"Dude."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"I thought everybody likes Everlong."
01:18:06;01:18:13;"I already hate it."
01:18:13;01:18:17;"Wow. People... Jake, I'm not kidding. People really like this song."
01:18:17;01:18:20;"Oh, is this Bush?"
01:18:23;01:18:28;"I don't like major label alternative music from the 90s. Sorry. Except for Weezer."
01:18:28;01:18:39;"Also, Foo Fighters would not be a band if Dave Grohl had not been in Nirvana. Foo Fighters would not be a big band."
01:18:39;01:18:45;"It's sort of like Hillary Clinton would not have gotten the nomination in 2016 if she hadn't been married to Bill Clinton. It's the same thing."
01:18:45;01:18:53;"Okay, but the difference is that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election and Foo Fighters are the biggest rock band in the world."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Okay, you burned me there."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"It breaks down my pride."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"You got me there."
01:18:58;01:19:07;"I just don't like these little mistakes of history that someone uses to have a big thing. I just don't like it."
01:19:13;01:19:16;"I don't like the band Filter. I don't like Bush."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"If our show was live, the phone lines would be lighting up right now."
01:19:19;01:19:20;"Oh my God."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"Jake doesn't like Prince and he doesn't like the Foo Fighters."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"I don't like Prince."

01:20:33;01:20:38;"the open heart surgery was that the Foo Fighters play for him."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"If you told me it was Howard Stern that requested this,"
01:20:42;01:20:43;"100% believe it."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"- That's a great call, Nick."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"The Foo Fighters are the worst band of all time."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"- Oh my God."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"I can't deal."
01:20:49;01:20:53;"I can't deal with the Foo Fighters, dude."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"I'm so sick to hear their new song from 2023."
01:20:56;01:20:59;"It's gonna be so fresh."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"Thank God the Grammy committee nominated it."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"- Wow, Jake just hating."
01:21:02;01:21:06;"Okay, first of all, okay, I tricked you guys twice."
01:21:06;01:21:10;"No, I didn't trick you at all."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"I didn't make that up."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"As you guys were gaslighting me,"
01:21:14;01:21:18;"I started to wonder if somehow what is..."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"(laughing)"
01:21:20;01:21:23;"As I was being gaslit by you guys,"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"I started to wonder, wait, am I crazy?"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"And no, I found an article."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"David Letterman called Everlong my favorite song"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"by my favorite band."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"During his recovery from heart surgery in 2000,"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"he said this was the song that got him through."
01:21:40;01:21:43;"He loved it so much and it had such meaning in his life"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"that he invited the Foo Fighters to perform it on the show"
01:21:46;01:21:50;"five different times between 1997 and 2015,"
01:21:50;01:21:54;"including two of the most momentous and poignant shows"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"in 2000 for Dave's first show back"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"after his heart surgery and recovery"
01:21:58;01:22:03;"and in 2015 for David Letterman's final show."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"- Psychotic behavior."
01:22:04;01:22:08;"- But psychotic."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- That's insane."
01:22:09;01:22:14;"They played Everlong five times."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"(laughing)"
01:22:16;01:22:19;"- I also wanna say, you know how on SNL"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"they do like the five timers club?"
01:22:21;01:22:25;"If you hosted SNL five times, you get a jacket."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"First of all, a lot of people have hosted SNL five times."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"That's really not that interesting."
01:22:29;01:22:32;"I think the only five timers club that matters"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"is a band who's played the same song five times"
01:22:34;01:22:38;"on Letterman and only one band has that honor."
01:22:38;01:22:41;"- They've invited Steve Martin back five times"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"to do the same monologue he's done."
01:22:44;01:22:47;"Since 1975."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"That's (beep) crazy."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Everlong is a good song"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"and it has a cool Michel Gondry video."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"- Do you think that Letterman's into other"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"like 90s kind of alt rock?"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"Is Dave Letterman low key like a Soundgarden head?"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Like he's like, oh dude, Spoonman?"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"(laughing)"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Maybe."
01:23:06;01:23:10;"- Spoonman had been performed three times."
01:23:10;01:23:12;"- Right, yeah."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- What a random band to latch onto."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"- Yeah, I don't know."
01:23:15;01:23:20;"I'm looking at David Letterman's favorite band music."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"- The only thing I've known about Letterman's music taste"
01:23:22;01:23:26;"is that he loved Warren Zeevon."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"And he had Warren Zeevon on a lot."
01:23:28;01:23:32;"And I think when maybe he had Zeevon on for a whole week"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"maybe when Zeevon was really in his last year of--"
01:23:34;01:23:37;"- Yeah, he loved Zeevon and Foo Fighters."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"- Well, I'm with you on the first point, Dave,"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"but geez Louise."
01:23:42;01:23:43;"You guys don't listen to Stern, do you?"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Do you listen to Jake?"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"- I have Sirius, but it's random that I listen to Stern."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"It's rarely."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"- I only have AM and FM."
01:23:52;01:23:56;"- He always, always talks about Train."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Like Train's his favorite band."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"- Oh, he loves Train, yeah."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"- Oh, he loves Train."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"I mean, maybe it's just a weird--"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"- We gotta do a Train episode."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- We should do a Train episode."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"- Drops of Jupiter?"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"- Through Stern, and then they do a great"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"Sesame Street episode, by the way."
01:24:14;01:24:16;"- Train does?"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"- Yeah, Train's on Sesame Street."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"They crush it."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"But there's something, I don't know."
01:24:20;01:24:25;"I put Foo Fighters and Train in the same company."
01:24:25;01:24:26;"- Oh my God."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"You guys are being very harsh."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"- No, Foo Fighters are a more significant band than Train,"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"but I prefer Train."
01:24:34;01:24:34;"- I mean."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"All right, let's get to the (beep) DM Grammy."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- All right, we gotta move on."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"We gotta move on."
01:24:40;01:24:41;"- Let's move on."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"We haven't even, we got into one of the songs yet."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"We gotta move."

01:24:48;01:24:50;"I don't even wanna listen to the Foo Fighters song now"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"because Jake's coming in so hot."

01:33:17;01:33:18;"- It's sort of based, yeah."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"I mean, I started speaking of,"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"like we were talking about Tom Petty earlier,"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"and I, like a few weeks ago,"
01:33:24;01:33:28;"I finally checked out that Peter Bogdanovich, Tom Petty doc,"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"and in the first like five minutes,"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"it was Dave Grohl in like 2005 being like,"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"no, I mean, he's one of the best songwriters of all time."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"And I was like, I'm turning this off."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"- Oh, man."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"- I got no love for Grohl."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"I don't need to see him in a doc"
01:33:41;01:33:44;"talking about Tom Petty being a good songwriter."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"- Wow."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"- Now I hate Bogdanovich."
01:33:46;01:33:47;"- I, I, I."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"- Grohl's a beloved pillar of the rock community"
01:33:51;01:33:52;"for a reason."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"- He's available."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"- Oh, okay, 'cause he's got a great energy"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"and he wrote ""Everlong."""
01:33:58;01:34:00;"- Bad song."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"And I don't, I can't, it makes me,"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"like David Letterman must be so demented to be like,"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"I'm emerging from a rock song."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"- I, I, I."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"- This is what I wanna hear."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"- I wanna give you a scenario that I don't think is like,"
01:34:13;01:34:18;"realistically, like too far, like from some kind of reality"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"is that Richard Pictures is playing"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"at the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"- Yeah."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"- Dave Grohl is there 'cause he's heard about"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Richard Pictures having a beer and he's like."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"- Not realistic."
01:34:28;01:34:30;"- It is absolutely realistic."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"I'm telling you it's realistic."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"It's absolutely realistic."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"I know it's realistic, 100%."
01:34:36;01:34:38;"- It's not remotely realistic, Nick."
01:34:38;01:34:38;"- No, it absolutely is."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"- There's no world in which Dave Grohl"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"would be at the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"- That's just not true."
01:34:43;01:34:46;"This is like a father at Max's school."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"He is around and he is down to clown"
01:34:48;01:34:51;"and he has like some couple of dads have been like,"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"we're into the dead, the dead is sort of like,"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"you know, maybe it's waning in cultural popularity"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"but they're like, yeah,"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"we wanna go out to the Old Town Pub."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"We heard there's this really fun"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"and he's gonna go out and he wants to,"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"and I'm saying--"
01:35:03;01:35:04;"- Yeah, it's definitely not impossible."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"- It's not impossible, Jake."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"And he says he wants--"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"- Far from it."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"- And he's like, I wanna get on drums."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"This would be fun."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"- Yeah, fine, get on drums."
01:35:11;01:35:14;"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Say no 'cause I talked (beep) on you"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"about on a internet radio show nine years ago."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"Who cares?"
01:35:20;01:35:21;"Yeah."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"- Nine years ago."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"- I don't like the pool fighters."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"- This isn't happening in a decade."
01:35:25;01:35:26;"(laughing)"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"- Okay, well, this is weird."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"All right."
01:35:29;01:35:29;"- It's 2032."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"- Do you think one member of Richard Pictures"
01:35:32;01:35:36;"has any interest in the foo fighters or Dave Grohl?"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Absolutely not."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"If he's in, yeah, he's a big celebrity."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"If he wants to hop on drums, sure."
01:35:42;01:35:47;"We'll have Dave Grohl play on China Cat Sunflower."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Have him play way too loud."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Great."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"That's fine."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"- What if he wanted to play Everlong"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"in the style of The Grateful Dead?"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"- Get off the stage, dude."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"(laughing)"
01:36:00;01:36:03;"No, I'm sure he's a great hang, man."
01:36:03;01:36:06;"That's why he's in all these dumb rock docs."
01:36:06;01:36:10;"And he's, this is like, look, the guy,"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"I'm sure he's a sweetheart of a guy."
01:36:12;01:36:17;"Great family man, et cetera."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"I don't have a thing about him personally."
01:36:18;01:36:23;"I just hate him as an artistic persona in the 21st century."
01:36:23;01:36:26;"- You just don't like the, but that's not even true"
01:36:26;01:36:27;"because you admire him as a drummer."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"- Yeah, I love his work in Nirvana."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"- Yeah, you just don't like the Foo's."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- I don't like anything after Nirvana."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"- I wonder if Grohl has played with everybody on this list."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"So we know he's obviously Foo Fighters."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"He's played with Queens of the Stone Age."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"He's played with Boy Genius."

01:36:43;01:36:45;"Has he ever performed with the Rolling Stones"
01:36:45;01:36:46;"or Olivia Rodrigo?"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"- He must've."
01:36:48;01:36:52;"I think Olivia is the odd woman out."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Hold on, let's, we gotta check this out."
01:36:54;01:36:54;"- We'll see, we'll see about that."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"- He's definitely sat, like,"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Foo is probably open for the Stones, right?"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"It's gotta, it must've happened."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"- While you guys research that,"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"we're gonna listen to Boy Genius, Not Strong Enough."

01:37:36;01:37:38;"- Okay."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"- The Stones played at the Fonda?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"Wow."

01:39:27;01:39:30;"your pick is still Olivia Rodrigo?"
01:39:30;01:39:31;"- Yeah."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"- Her best rock song?"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"By a mile?"

01:39:49;01:39:51;"I can't judge stuff like that on first listen."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Like I've heard that song a few times and now I hear it"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"and I'm like, yeah, it's a single."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"- I mean, it's just, to me, it's like, am I in a Starbucks?"
01:39:57;01:40:00;"Like, I don't know, I just, it just doesn't,"

01:40:09;01:40:11;"- It's a little more rocking than that."
01:40:11;01:40:18;"That's like an alternative rock song."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"- I mean, one thing I can say is that these all,"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"all four have been rock songs."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"They all have guitars."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"- Very low bar."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"- Drums."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"- No, but I think what you're saying,"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"as you were saying is sometimes,"
01:40:31;01:40:35;"sometimes it's not the case, right?"
01:40:35;01:40:38;"That's what you're also saying is that it is a low bar,"
01:40:38;01:40:41;"but it's not a bar that always is clear."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"- Rock can mean so many different things."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"And this is actually a fairly consistent batch of songs."

01:49:47;01:49:49;"The Foo's, Stone's, and actually, throwing the Queens,"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"I think they're stealing votes from each other."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"You're the old rock person."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"You got warm feelings towards Dave Grohl, of course,"
01:49:57;01:50:00;"known as one of the friendliest guys in rock music,"
01:50:00;01:50:05;"a legend, a beloved guy who's been in two iconic bands."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"- Just a sweetheart of a guy."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"- And so a lot of people are gonna wanna vote for him,"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"but some of them are gonna be like,"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"oh, but I mean, I gotta vote for the Stone's."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"So I think they're cannibalizing each other's votes,"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"throwing Queens to the Stone Age,"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"and you might get the slightly more jaded"

01:50:21;01:50:24;"I like the Queens song better than the Foo's."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"So I don't know, those three are taking votes away."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"And then Olivia Rodrigo,"
01:50:28;01:50:31;"I think she is beloved by the Grammys."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"She probably already won some Grammys."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"That, we don't even have to fact check that,"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"but either way, she's the type of person"

01:50:39;01:50:40;"- Sure."
01:50:40;01:50:42;"- She's a young superstar out the gate."

01:50:44;01:50:47;"Like, whoa, we can still create superstars in this industry."
01:50:47;01:50:50;"People, Grammy voters like that."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"But somehow I think they might think,"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"I'll vote for her in a different category, not rock."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"They think of her,"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"even though her music incorporates rock for sure."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"But when people talk about Olivia Rodrigo,"
01:51:02;01:51:03;"they say pop star."
01:51:03;01:51:07;"She's also the only solo artist in the category."

01:51:31;01:51:34;"It's the only song title that's even remotely interesting."
01:51:34;01:51:37;"- Because you do not remember how it sounds, correct?"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"- No, absolutely not."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"- Okay, but you know what?"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"You know what my second choice is after boy genius?"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Is Foo Fighters."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"'Cause I do think they could potentially"

01:52:32;01:52:35;"- I think I just like saying Side Two of Tattoo You."
