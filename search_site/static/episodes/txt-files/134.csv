00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis back once again."
00:03;00:06;"After many weeks with not a lot of guests,"
00:06;00:09;"we come hard with two."
00:09;00:14;"Legendary uncle of Jake and musician Uncle Ted."
00:14;00:19;"We'll also be joined by legendary writer, talk show"
00:19;00:21;"host, and podcaster Spike Ferencton."
00:21;00:27;"All this plus art talk and the great music of today in 1995."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:37;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"They were a friend, warming me, all my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow."
01:01;01:04;"One of us had to go."
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:11;"One of us is crying."
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying."
01:14;01:19;"Leave the lonely man."
01:19;01:22;"All right, Time Crisis back once again."
01:22;01:23;"What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:24;"Not much, man."
01:24;01:25;"How are you?"
01:25;01:27;"You know, business as usual."
01:27;01:27;"Yeah."
01:27;01:31;"I guess since the last episode, we became candy influencers."
01:31;01:33;"So we should probably talk about that."
01:33;01:34;"That is true."
01:34;01:39;"And also that's going to lead into our Hershey's Yingling"
01:39;01:40;"taste test."
01:40;01:41;"Yeah."
01:41;01:43;"I bet there probably is like a podcast, maybe not"
01:43;01:45;"an internet radio show, but I can"
01:45;01:47;"imagine there's a podcast somewhere that's"
01:47;01:48;"about beer and candy."
01:48;01:53;"And then when the Yingling Hershey's comes out,"
01:53;01:54;"that's a big deal."
01:54;01:56;"And they get to finally talk about both."
01:56;01:59;"But I can totally see that person who's a candy"
01:59;02:01;"enthusiast and a beer enthusiast."
02:01;02:04;"Well, I'm sorry, but there is one podcast called"
02:04;02:07;"It's the Beer Talking."
02:07;02:10;"They do a Halloween candy and beer pairing episode."
02:10;02:11;"There you go."
02:11;02:14;"It's not a whole pod dedicated to it,"
02:14;02:18;"but it's definitely a hard 41 minutes about Halloween candy"
02:18;02:19;"and beer pairing."
02:19;02:21;"Well, as a beer and candy enthusiast,"
02:21;02:24;"I only check in with that podcast for the Halloween app,"
02:24;02:25;"but it is good."
02:25;02:26;"I do recommend it."
02:26;02:30;"But I only listen once a year for the candy and beer app."
02:30;02:33;"I wonder if you could do a study and be"
02:33;02:36;"like kids who are really into candy become adults who are"
02:36;02:41;"really into beer, if there's a connection there."
02:41;02:44;"I feel like now it'd be like kids who are really into candy"
02:44;02:46;"become adults who are really into candy."
02:46;02:47;"Yeah, you're right."
02:47;02:49;"There's no you don't have to give it up."
02:49;02:53;"And I feel like maybe back a generation or two prior,"
02:53;02:54;"you would have had to give it up."
02:54;02:55;"Right."
02:55;02:57;"And you shift to alcohol or something."
02:57;02:59;"Yeah, like the Mad Men era."
02:59;02:59;"Yeah."
02:59;03:06;"Don Draper's not wailing on peanut M&Ms."
03:06;03:09;"There's like a whole episode of that."
03:09;03:12;"Don's just stress eating peanut M&Ms."
03:12;03:15;"He has like this huge bowl of Skittles."
03:15;03:19;"He has a beautiful mid-century modern coffee table"
03:19;03:20;"in his office."
03:20;03:22;"And he's wearing this like tailored suit."
03:22;03:25;"He sits down for the meeting with the big account."
03:25;03:28;"And he pours two glasses of scotch."
03:28;03:31;"And then there's like just a big bowl of Skittles."
03:31;03:33;"Gentlemen, can I offer you a now and later?"
03:33;03:35;"Can I offer you some Sour Punch straws?"
03:35;03:38;"Or it's like he's lying on the mid-century couch"
03:38;03:39;"with his hat on his head."
03:39;03:41;"Like 3 PM, the secretary comes."
03:41;03:42;"It's like Mr. Draper."
03:42;03:44;"And he's just like, leave me alone."
03:44;03:47;"I had way too many Butterfingers."
03:47;03:49;"Me and Roger had a three Butterfinger lunch."
03:49;03:49;"Oh."
03:49;03:57;"Well, so Jake, walk me through your--"
03:57;03:59;"I think we had slightly different experiences"
03:59;04:02;"as we became candy influencers last week."
04:02;04:06;"Because I saw a big box delivered to my home."
04:06;04:07;"And I opened it."
04:07;04:09;"And there's this giant Kit Kat thing."
04:09;04:10;"And I'm like, wait."
04:10;04:13;"First of all, immediately, I go to Wikipedia."
04:13;04:15;"And I'm like, who owns Kit Kat?"
04:15;04:19;"And it turns out Hershey's owns Kit Kat only in the US."
04:19;04:22;"The rest of the world, Kit Kat is a Nestle product."
04:22;04:23;"So I was like, OK."
04:23;04:25;"Maybe it's our friends at Hershey's."
04:25;04:27;"But then I hit up the TC people."
04:27;04:28;"I hit up my manager."
04:28;04:30;"Nobody had actually communicated with them."
04:30;04:36;"So I guess they just used the CIA to just get to me direct."
04:36;04:37;"Wait, Jake, you're already drinking the beer?"
04:37;04:38;"Yeah, sorry."
04:38;04:39;"I had to get going."
04:39;04:40;"What?"
04:40;04:43;"What are you-- this whole thing."
04:43;04:44;"Jake's just making a-- all right."
04:44;04:44;"Well, Jake already made--"
04:44;04:46;"I didn't want you to blow up my spot."
04:46;04:48;"But when we got to the beer tasting episode,"
04:48;04:49;"I would have--"
04:49;04:50;"or portion of the episode, I would"
04:50;04:52;"have faked opening the beer."
04:52;04:53;"And then I would have been like, oh, yeah."
04:53;04:54;"I'm taking my first sip."
04:54;04:55;"All right, well, you know what?"
04:55;04:56;"I got it out of the freezer."
04:56;04:57;"It's freezing cold."
04:57;04:58;"I want to take a sip right now."
04:58;04:59;"[BLEEP]"
04:59;04:59;"We'll do it live."
04:59;05:03;"Everybody just drink your beer at your pleasure."
05:03;05:06;"This yingling Hershey's chocolate porter is nasty."
05:06;05:07;"I'm going to agree with Daniel."
05:07;05:08;"It's very chocolatey."
05:08;05:09;"It's a bummer."
05:09;05:10;"OK, well, hold on."
05:10;05:11;"Anyway."
05:11;05:13;"Yeah, let's get back to the Kit Kat."
05:13;05:14;"So I got this big box."
05:14;05:16;"And I was like, I guess it came from Hershey's."
05:16;05:19;"But it wasn't totally arranged."
05:19;05:20;"I wasn't expecting it."
05:20;05:21;"And then I opened the box."
05:21;05:25;"And there's a bunch of Kit Kats, a bunch of Mocha Kit Kats."
05:25;05:29;"And then there's-- it's a very well-made, high-quality"
05:29;05:31;"cardboard box."
05:31;05:33;"I'm sure producing each box--"
05:33;05:35;"you're using the really high-grade cardboard"
05:35;05:36;"to make it."
05:36;05:40;"I'm sure producing each one of those is maybe $14 a unit."
05:40;05:42;"Pretty good guess."
05:42;05:44;"And there's a pair of socks, a mug,"
05:44;05:47;"and then a bunch of mint Kit Kats."
05:47;05:48;"But I was still a little bit baffled"
05:48;05:49;"because there was no context."
05:49;05:52;"But then I hear that you got one too, Jake,"
05:52;05:54;"but yours came with a card."
05:54;05:55;"Somehow my card--"
05:55;05:56;"OK, yeah."
05:56;05:57;"Walk through your experience."
05:57;06:00;"I mean, yeah, I saw the big box."
06:00;06:03;"And I thought-- I was like, oh, I ordered some shoes last week."
06:03;06:04;"I bet they're here."
06:04;06:06;"Because it's like-- it looked like a shoe box,"
06:06;06:07;"but even bigger."
06:07;06:08;"And I'm sort of like--"
06:08;06:12;"And then I opened it up, and it was like this lush, gorgeous,"
06:12;06:15;"high-production-value box with just that beautiful,"
06:15;06:18;"kind of rich red, just a Jake category."
06:18;06:19;"And I was like, what is this?"
06:19;06:21;"And then, yeah, opened it up."
06:21;06:23;"Same experience with the shelving and the socks."
06:23;06:24;"But then there was two postcards."
06:24;06:28;"And one said, welcome to the Kit Kat Flavor Club."
06:28;06:33;"You are one of the first 200 members of the Kit Kat Flavor"
06:33;06:34;"Club."
06:34;06:36;"And then there was another card."
06:36;06:37;"So I felt great about that."
06:37;06:38;"I love being--"
06:38;06:40;"So there's only 200 people."
06:40;06:42;"If I had seen that, I would have felt--"
06:42;06:45;"I would have understood the importance of the moment more."
06:45;06:47;"So you're telling me there's only 200 people in the Kit Kat"
06:47;06:48;"Flavor Club?"
06:48;06:50;"Yeah, so that feels great for us to be all included in that."
06:50;06:55;"I like to be involved in exclusive clubs."
06:55;06:58;"And then there was another postcard, which I love,"
06:58;07:01;"that said, it's the Hershey Company Social Media"
07:01;07:03;"Guidelines."
07:03;07:06;"And there's eight rules that we have to follow since we're now"
07:06;07:07;"members of the club."
07:07;07:09;"Because if we're going to join the club,"
07:09;07:12;"we have to play ball."
07:12;07:13;"This isn't just a free lunch."
07:13;07:14;"Fair enough."
07:14;07:15;"What is a club without rules?"
07:15;07:17;"So please abide by the following guidelines"
07:17;07:21;"when posting about incentives, such as free samples, premiums,"
07:21;07:22;"or prizes on social media."
07:22;07:24;"Oh, [BLEEP] I posted about this."
07:24;07:25;"I really looked."
07:25;07:26;"I didn't see my card."
07:26;07:29;"You must disclose your connection to Hershey."
07:29;07:30;"Well, I would say your connection to Hershey"
07:30;07:31;"is tenuous."
07:31;07:33;"What is our connection to Hershey?"
07:33;07:35;"We're public critics of the company."
07:35;07:37;"We're basically journalists."
07:37;07:39;"Oh, wait, did we compromise our journalistic values?"
07:39;07:41;"Let's get Glenn Greenwald on the next episode"
07:41;07:45;"of talking about candy and ethics and journalism."
07:45;07:47;"Well, OK, we're going to have to unpack"
07:47;07:49;"a lot of the ethics of what it means that we're now"
07:49;07:50;"candy influencers."
07:50;07:52;"We're journalists and candy influencers."
07:52;07:53;"But go on."
07:53;07:53;"What are the other rules?"
07:53;07:55;"Yeah, let me just run through these fast."
07:55;07:56;"Number two is statements should be"
07:56;08:01;"honest and truthful opinions and actual experiences."
08:01;08:02;"OK."
08:02;08:02;"I like that."
08:02;08:06;"Statements should be factual and able to be verified."
08:06;08:09;"I will verify to you right now that this beer is terrible."
08:09;08:13;"Number four, you must not disclose any Hershey"
08:13;08:14;"confidential information."
08:14;08:15;"Do we have any?"
08:15;08:19;"Will we ever be given any?"
08:19;08:23;"You guys didn't get that other envelope of their stock?"
08:23;08:25;"We're arrested on insider trading"
08:25;08:29;"because we got to taste the mint Kit Kat early."
08:29;08:32;"We're just like, this is a winner right here."
08:32;08:34;"I have to say that mint Kit Kat was great."
08:34;08:36;"Did you like it?"
08:36;08:37;"I really liked it."
08:37;08:39;"Respect intellectual property rights."
08:39;08:41;"You are personally liable under federal and state"
08:41;08:45;"law for your actions with respect to your social media."
08:45;08:46;"That's a little scary."
08:46;08:49;"That's a little scary."
08:49;08:50;"Oh my god."
08:50;08:53;"We reserve the right to ask you to remove content."
08:53;08:56;"Lastly, you must follow the Hershey Company integration"
08:56;08:57;"guidelines."
08:57;08:58;"Not sure what that is."
08:58;09:00;"Sounds weighty."
09:00;09:03;"Maybe they didn't send me the guidelines on purpose."
09:03;09:07;"Maybe they were like, Jake's more of a loose cannon."
09:07;09:09;"We could see him really going off the reservation"
09:09;09:11;"writing some wild [BLEEP] and maybe they"
09:11;09:13;"knew like Ezra's a little more respectful."
09:13;09:15;"We don't need to like throw all the--"
09:15;09:17;"we literally don't need to throw the rule book at him."

10:15;10:17;"- I was gonna ask Seinfeld if he's looked up"
10:17;10:21;"any online reviews of the Hershey's Yingling beer."
10:21;10:23;"- I haven't, but I can look it up."
10:23;10:26;"But I have my own review, it's delicious."
10:26;10:29;"- And I know that, I see that you liked it"
10:29;10:31;"when you took a sip, I think this is disgusting."
10:31;10:34;"- It's like normal beer, but somebody put like a Hershey,"
10:34;10:35;"a Hershey inside it."
10:35;10:37;"- I was gonna say the opposite."
10:37;10:39;"I feel it's a candy bar that people"
10:39;10:40;"have poured beer on top of."
10:40;10:41;"- Six of one."
10:41;10:42;"- It's a little bit."
10:42;10:44;"- Yeah, I can't finish it, I gotta switch gears."
10:44;10:46;"I'm gonna make a margarita."
10:46;10:47;"- Ezra, weigh in."
10:47;10:51;"- I legitimately enjoyed the mustard beer last time."
10:51;10:53;"Yeah, I wouldn't say this is great,"
10:53;10:55;"but I can't bring myself to hate it."
10:55;10:59;"I'm also wondering too, this is a very naive question,"
10:59;11:04;"but very prominently on the upper label on the beer,"
11:04;11:07;"it says very prominently 21 plus to enjoy."
11:07;11:11;"Does all beer say 21 plus?"
11:11;11:13;"- No, no, I don't think so."
11:13;11:17;"No, I'm looking at a Pacifico."
11:17;11:19;"I think it's because it's candy."
11:19;11:22;"- I didn't think I'd seen that before 21 plus to enjoy."
11:22;11:23;"Yeah, I wouldn't say it's great,"
11:23;11:26;"but at the same time, I'm legitimately curious."
11:26;11:30;"If I went to a bar and I wasn't staring at the Hershey's logo"
11:30;11:34;"and somebody was just like, I'm gonna get like a porter."
11:34;11:37;"Like some (beep) I don't even really know what it means."
11:37;11:41;"I know a porter I assume is like richer than a pale ale,"
11:41;11:42;"than an IPA."
11:42;11:44;"If I was at a bar and some people were like,"
11:44;11:46;"this round we're gonna get some porters, you want one?"
11:46;11:48;"And I'll say, sure, I'll get whatever you guys get."
11:48;11:51;"And then somebody came down and plopped this in front of me"
11:51;11:53;"in a glass and I sipped it."
11:53;11:55;"I don't even know what I would think."
11:55;11:56;"I don't know if I'd be like,"
11:56;11:57;"damn, this is chocolatey and sweet."
11:57;12:00;"I think I'd just kind of like take it down"
12:00;12:01;"and barely even think about it."
12:01;12:04;"- Like the first few sips, I'd be like, God, this is nasty."
12:04;12:05;"But then I would just be like,"
12:05;12:07;"well, I'm just gonna like adjust to it."
12:07;12:09;"And like, this is what I'm drinking."
12:09;12:12;"I don't think I would get to the point where I'm like,"
12:12;12:13;"you know what, F this."
12:13;12:16;"I would just be like, someone bought a round."
12:16;12:17;"It looks like Guinness or something, you know,"
12:17;12:19;"it's like really dark, you know."
12:19;12:19;"- Right."
12:19;12:24;"- Beeradvocate.com gives it an overall score of 88%."
12:24;12:25;"Very good."
12:25;12:29;"That's 138 reviews they've averaged that out of."
12:29;12:30;"The first comment says,"
12:30;12:32;"pours deep copper with a half inch tan head,"
12:32;12:35;"which dissipates moderate lacing."
12:35;12:35;"Aroma."
12:35;12:38;"- Wait, what the (beep)"
12:38;12:40;"- What is this psycho?"
12:40;12:41;"- The top review says,"
12:41;12:43;"pours deep copper with a half inch tan head,"
12:43;12:44;"which dissipates moderate lacing."
12:44;12:45;"- Hold on, what is this?"
12:45;12:47;"I, wait, so you gotta slow down, man."
12:47;12:49;"I don't even understand the syntax."
12:49;12:51;"Pours deep copper."
12:51;12:54;"- So it pours, the way it pours is like a deep copper."
12:54;12:55;"- The color."
12:55;12:59;"- Yeah, then the head is a half inch tan."
12:59;13:03;"Then aroma of dark cocoa, light roast malt."
13:03;13:06;"Taste follows nose, dark cocoa, light roast malt."
13:06;13:09;"Also a bit of caramel, thin body."
13:09;13:11;"- Why does it sound like slam poetry?"
13:11;13:12;"(laughing)"
13:12;13:15;"The way you're reading it, it's like total slam poetry."
13:15;13:18;"Moderate lacing, pours deep copper."
13:18;13:24;"- Hey, I completely agree with Peach63 on this one."
13:24;13:25;"Thin bodied, a bit sticky,"
13:25;13:28;"moderate carbonation, semi-sweet finish."
13:28;13:31;"Then they go on to say thin bodied for a porter."
13:31;13:32;"It is pretty good though."
13:32;13:35;"And I think they took the words right out of my mouth."
13:35;13:36;"- With the lacing?"
13:36;13:38;"- Well, the lacing is really where I started to really-"
13:38;13:41;"- Wait, so what do you think lacing means?"
13:41;13:44;"- Lacing is the residue left from the foam beer head"
13:44;13:45;"as you drink beer."
13:45;13:48;"If you pour this beer into a glass, you take a sip,"
13:48;13:51;"the head is gonna stick to the side of the glass."
13:51;13:54;"And if it sticks to the side of the glass,"
13:54;13:57;"I guess that's a thick lacing."
13:57;13:59;"If it's lighter, if the residue is lighter,"
13:59;14:01;"I guess that's a lighter lacing."
14:01;14:02;"- Okay."
14:02;14:04;"Pours deep copper."
14:04;14:08;"That just makes me think of throwing copper."
14:08;14:10;"- Dick, you know what throwing copper is?"
14:10;14:11;"- Is that a live album?"
14:11;14:12;"- Yes."
14:12;14:15;"I figured you'd get that."
14:15;14:18;"And for anybody who's not familiar with the band Live,"
14:18;14:21;"this is not a live recording of some other band."
14:21;14:23;"This is a band called Live."
14:23;14:25;"It's actually a studio album."
14:25;14:26;"- And you know what's cool?"
14:26;14:28;"That band is from Pennsylvania."
14:28;14:29;"- Oh, really?"
14:29;14:32;"Are they from Philadelphia?"
14:32;14:34;"- York, Pennsylvania."
14:34;14:36;"Yeah, more rural."
14:36;14:38;"I feel like York is like greater Philly."
14:38;14:39;"- Okay."
14:39;14:40;"- That's not even that close."
14:40;14:42;"Interesting."
14:42;14:43;"Well, shout out to Live."
14:43;14:44;"Ed Kowalczyk."

15:56;16:00;"So Jake, have you just been eating the Kit Kats?"
16:00;16:02;"Have you worn the socks?"
16:02;16:06;"What's your relationship been like with this box?"
16:06;16:08;"- I've made coffee using a pour over"
16:08;16:12;"into the Kit Kat coffee mug in my studio."
16:12;16:13;"Worked out great."
16:13;16:15;"Starting to cool down a little bit."
16:15;16:18;"So I'm starting to have hot coffee in the morning there."
16:18;16:19;"And so that's been great."
16:19;16:22;"I have not worn the socks yet."
16:22;16:23;"I'm loving the mint."
16:23;16:24;"I've had a few of those."
16:24;16:25;"And then the rest of them,"
16:25;16:28;"I dropped off at the art gallery that represents me."
16:28;16:29;"I dropped it off."
16:29;16:34;"I dropped the box off with the rest of the Mocha Kit Kats"
16:34;16:36;"for the people that work there to enjoy."
16:36;16:41;"'Cause I don't need, you know, 20 Kit Kats on my house."
16:41;16:42;"Don't need it."
16:42;16:43;"- You weren't interested in the Mocha flavor at all?"
16:43;16:44;"- I tried it."
16:44;16:45;"- Wait, you got it too?"
16:45;16:47;"- Yeah, I got, I'm part of the flavor club too."
16:47;16:48;"- Do we all?"
16:48;16:49;"I think we all are."
16:49;16:51;"- We're a majority of the flavor club."
16:51;16:53;"- All four of us got it?"
16:53;16:55;"- And Matt, the producer."
16:55;16:59;"- Oh, you guys, there's five TC related people."
16:59;17:00;"Oh, I didn't understand this."
17:00;17:02;"Oh, I thought it was just me and Jake."
17:02;17:02;"I'm sorry."
17:02;17:04;"I didn't realize I was talking to fellow members"
17:04;17:07;"of the Kit Kats flavor club."
17:07;17:09;"So, okay, so if it really is only 200 people"
17:09;17:13;"and five are part of the TC crew,"
17:13;17:15;"then let me get an actual number crunch."
17:15;17:20;"I think that makes us 2.5% of the KKFC."
17:20;17:21;"- You are absolutely right."
17:21;17:22;"Yeah."
17:22;17:24;"- We're 2.5%."
17:24;17:25;"- Yeah."
17:25;17:26;"- That's solid."
17:26;17:27;"- We're the vocal minority."
17:27;17:33;"- Wait, also, by the way, the Kit Kat club is a place."
17:33;17:35;"It was, I guess there's a lot of places called,"
17:35;17:39;"there's a club in Berlin called the Kit Kat club,"
17:39;17:43;"opened in 1994 by Austrian pornographic filmmaker,"
17:43;17:47;"Simon Thor and his life partner, Kirsten Kruger."
17:47;17:49;"The Kit Kat club is said to attract patrons"
17:49;17:51;"from all over Europe and other parts of the world"
17:51;17:54;"because of its music selection, techno and trance music,"
17:54;17:56;"and it's sexually uninhibited parties."
17:56;17:58;"The motto of the club is do what you want,"
17:58;18:00;"but stay in communication."
18:00;18:02;"Guests are allowed to engage in sexual intercourse"
18:02;18:03;"openly at the venue."
18:03;18:07;"Yeah, I'm just saying, Hershey's, you might wanna."
18:07;18:08;"I've never been there."
18:08;18:09;"I do remember being in Berlin"
18:09;18:11;"and hearing people talk about the Kit Kat club."
18:11;18:12;"I think also-"
18:12;18:13;"- Also famously-"
18:13;18:15;"- Okay, the Kit Kat club-"
18:15;18:17;"- In New York where Trump met Melania"
18:17;18:19;"in New York City at the Kit Kat club."
18:19;18:21;"- So there's Kit Kat clubs all over the place, huh?"
18:21;18:24;"I guess, are they all named after,"
18:24;18:28;"that's the name of the nightclub in the musical ""Cabaret,"""
18:28;18:30;"which I've never actually seen."
18:30;18:33;"I kinda wanna see it, but there's a burlesque theater"
18:33;18:36;"in Berlin in the 1930s during the ascent of the Nazi party,"
18:36;18:38;"also called the Kit Kat club."
18:38;18:40;"Okay, the original Kit Kat club"
18:40;18:44;"was an early 18th century English club in London"
18:44;18:47;"with strong political and literary associations."
18:47;18:50;"Okay, so actually this raises a question for me."
18:50;18:52;"What does Kit Kat actually mean?"
18:52;18:54;"In 1705, Thomas Hurn wrote,"
18:54;18:57;"""The Kit Kat club got its name from Christopher Catling."""
18:57;18:59;"Doesn't totally explain it."
18:59;19:03;"Oh, and I guess the nickname for Christopher is Kit."
19:03;19:06;"So his name was Chris Kat."
19:06;19:07;"So his name was Kit Kat."
19:07;19:10;"So it was just somebody's name, I guess, Kit Kat."
19:10;19:12;"It sounds like you know what it means,"
19:12;19:14;"maybe because Kat is a word."
19:14;19:17;"- I mean, this might be for another episode."
19:17;19:18;"We're gonna have to draw this out."
19:18;19:20;"I mean, what's the connection"
19:20;19:22;"between the club and the candy?"
19:22;19:25;"- Just real quick, I'm on the Kit Kat."
19:25;19:27;"For the type of food goes back to the 18th century"
19:27;19:29;"when mutton pies known as Kit Kat"
19:29;19:33;"were served at meetings of the Kit Kat club in London."
19:33;19:35;"And then Roundtree's, a confectionery company"
19:35;19:36;"based in York."
19:36;19:38;"Whoa, this is getting weird."
19:38;19:40;"York, England, not York, Pennsylvania,"
19:40;19:42;"where Live and Ed Kowalczyk are from."
19:42;19:45;"In 1911, a British company based in York"
19:45;19:47;"trademarked the terms Kit Kat"
19:47;19:48;"and made the first Kit Kat bar."
19:48;19:50;"So Kit Kat comes from England."
19:50;19:52;"- And it was a mutton pie?"
19:52;19:55;"- The first food ever called a Kit Kat"
19:55;19:58;"was a mutton pie served at the Kit Kat club."
19:58;19:59;"- I love that."
19:59;20:01;"- I guess that kind of makes sense."
20:01;20:02;"Like in the 18th century,"
20:02;20:04;"we have a mutton pie called Kit Kat."
20:04;20:06;"And then 200 years later, somebody's like,"
20:06;20:08;"Kit Kat, it's like a fun name for a food."
20:08;20:10;"Like it could be, and now it's a candy."
20:10;20:11;"- I love that. - Well, there you go."
20:11;20:13;"- Does the Kit Kat flavor club"
20:13;20:16;"hearken back to the original Kit Kat club?"
20:16;20:17;"Like have we come full circle?"
20:17;20:19;"Do you think that was an inspiration?"
20:19;20:20;"- Oh yeah, no, for sure."
20:20;20:24;"It's definitely like a literary political society."
20:24;20:27;"- It says that members of the original Kit Kat club"
20:27;20:32;"in 18th century London were committed Whigs,"
20:32;20:33;"which was a political party"
20:33;20:36;"that actually existed in the US at some point."
20:36;20:39;"So the Whigs' origin, constitutional monarchism"
20:39;20:41;"and opposition to absolute monarchy,"
20:41;20:43;"I would say that's true of all of us."
20:43;20:46;"I don't think any of us are absolute monarchists."
20:46;20:48;"Well, Seinfeld, you're Canadian."
20:48;20:51;"So your relationship to the crown's a little different"
20:51;20:54;"than us, but you're not an absolute monarchist, are you?"
20:54;20:56;"- No, but I certainly feel an allegiance to the Commonwealth."
20:56;21:01;"- Do you consider the queen to be your kind of like"
21:01;21:03;"spiritual head of state or whatever?"
21:03;21:04;"- Yeah, definitely."
21:04;21:07;"I mean, she's on all the money, so it makes sense."
21:07;21:09;"- Do you recognize her divine tower?"
21:09;21:10;"- All the time."
21:10;21:13;"- Okay, you're a constitutional monarchist."
21:13;21:15;"- Maybe it isn't that a million miles away."
21:15;21:17;"All right, maybe we should hit up Hershey's and say like,"
21:17;21:20;"you know, we've uncovered some (beep) like,"
21:20;21:22;"you guys starting a Kit Kat club is actually taking"
21:22;21:24;"the whole Kit Kat journey full circle."
21:24;21:29;"And we'd like to do a kind of literary salon pop-up"
21:29;21:33;"in London and we can invite a lot of like intellectuals"
21:33;21:36;"and stuff like, wait, what if we found out?"
21:37;21:40;"What if we found out that the Kit Kat club is like"
21:40;21:43;"five members of the Crisis crew?"
21:43;21:44;"Salman Rushdie."
21:44;21:50;"- Carl Nosegard."
21:50;21:53;"- Maybe the queen, Prince William."
21:53;21:55;"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle like renounced"
21:55;21:58;"their titles and moved to California,"
21:58;22:01;"I think they also renounced their membership"
22:01;22:03;"in the Kit Kat flavor club."
22:03;22:06;"- Interestingly, Ghislaine Maxwell's still a member though."
22:06;22:08;"(laughing)"
22:08;22:16;"- But I will say that I, as far as these things go,"
22:16;22:18;"obviously outside of Seinfeld,"
22:18;22:20;"none of us are huge fans of the beer,"
22:20;22:23;"but I was very impressed when, you know,"
22:23;22:25;"we talked to Ryan Reese, even though he wouldn't give us"
22:25;22:28;"all the secrets of the Hershey's corporation."
22:28;22:29;"You know, I liked the way he thought it."
22:29;22:31;"Actually that conversation made me way more interested"
22:31;22:34;"in Hershey's as a company."
22:34;22:35;"And I got to say the Kit Kat flavor club,"
22:35;22:39;"as far as these kind of just like mail out things go,"
22:39;22:41;"I think it was a very well-made box."
22:41;22:46;"And the idea of being a member of a flavor club is exciting."
22:46;22:50;"Now, I don't know if this is a one-time thing,"
22:50;22:52;"being a member of a club, that kind of implies to me"
22:52;22:57;"that we're, you know, gonna be regularly receiving"
22:57;22:59;"new Kit Kat boxes with different flavors."
22:59;23:00;"I posted about it."
23:00;23:02;"I didn't know that there were guidelines."
23:02;23:05;"I hope my post on my Instagram story"
23:05;23:06;"didn't break any of the guidelines."
23:06;23:08;"I tried to keep it simple,"
23:08;23:10;"but it definitely got me talking about Kit Kats."
23:10;23:15;"I did two stops in my neighborhood with people I knew."
23:15;23:16;"I did reverse trick-or-treating"
23:16;23:20;"where I dropped off Kit Kats at their homes."
23:20;23:24;"So they basically got me pounding the pavement now"
23:24;23:25;"because I didn't want to eat all the Kit Kats"
23:25;23:28;"'cause I try not to eat that much candy."
23:28;23:30;"That is the tough part of being a candy influencer"
23:30;23:33;"is that we receive such a high volume of candy"
23:33;23:36;"and we need to eat the candy so that we can comment on it"
23:36;23:38;"and, you know, have hot takes"
23:38;23:39;"about the candy news of the day."
23:39;23:43;"But also, as an influencer, we have to look good."
23:43;23:44;"You know, if you eat too many Kit Kats,"
23:44;23:47;"you eat too much sugar, you can get kind of a bloated look."
23:47;23:49;"Your face doesn't look camera-ready."
23:49;23:51;"So, you know, I've always been a little bit jealous"
23:51;23:54;"of beauty influencers because everything's going"
23:54;23:56;"in the same direction there."
23:56;23:59;"You're a beauty influencer, your brand is beauty,"
23:59;24:00;"you have to look good for the videos."
24:00;24:02;"It's all pushing in the same direction."
24:02;24:05;"Candy influencer, you're being pulled"
24:05;24:06;"in two different directions."
24:06;24:08;"You know what I mean? - Hard work."
24:08;24:09;"Hard work. - It's hard work."
24:09;24:11;"And there are times that I regret"
24:11;24:13;"becoming a candy influencer."
24:13;24:14;"You know, I used to have a pretty good job,"
24:14;24:18;"but this is the life that we all chose."
24:18;24:20;"- And honestly, I'm very grateful."
24:20;24:23;"- I feel like you could-- - I'm grateful too."
24:23;24:26;"- You could easily use the candy influencer thing"
24:26;24:29;"to pivot into music or something, though."
24:29;24:30;"If you wanted to use it as a springboard"
24:30;24:31;"into entertainment."
24:31;24:32;"(laughing)"
24:32;24:35;"- Just like the next time there's a Vampire Weekend song,"
24:35;24:38;"just like, that is always a difficult one."
24:38;24:40;"We've all seen an influencer try to do it"
24:40;24:43;"where I'm just like, ""Hey guys, I know you mostly follow me"
24:43;24:44;"""for my candy, but some of you might know"
24:44;24:47;"""I'm also pretty passionate about music anyway."
24:47;24:49;"""My band's got a new single coming out."
24:49;24:51;"""Please check it out."
24:51;24:52;"""Would really appreciate that."""
24:52;24:54;"And then just all the comments are just like,"
24:54;24:57;"""Stick to candy influencing, dumbass."""
24:57;24:59;"And then some people are trying to be nice"
24:59;25:01;"and they're like, ""Honestly, I hear some Kit Kat influence"
25:01;25:02;"""in the music."""
25:02;25:05;"And I'm just like, ""Uh, well, it's kind of a different part"
25:05;25:06;"""of my life."""
25:06;25:09;"""No, totally, this is great music for when you're eating"
25:09;25:10;"""candy."""
25:10;25:13;"And I'm like, ""No, this is, it's kind of its own thing, guys."""
25:13;25:16;"And just like painfully trying to establish"
25:16;25:19;"something outside of my life as a candy influencer."
26:03;26:06;"- You're listening to Time Crisis."
26:06;26:09;"- All right, so we got some great guests today."
26:09;26:13;"And the first one is somebody who's loomed large"
26:13;26:14;"on the program."
26:14;26:17;"We've heard his name before, and this is Jake's Uncle Ted."
26:17;26:18;"- That's right."
26:18;26:20;"- And we were talking about him most recently, I think,"
26:20;26:23;"because we were mourning the passing of rock legend,"
26:23;26:24;"Eddie Van Halen."
26:24;26:27;"You were talking, Jake, about the fact that your Uncle Ted"
26:27;26:30;"grew up in Pasadena around the same time."
26:30;26:32;"- And is about the same age as those guys."
26:32;26:35;"- And I definitely saw them play some early shows."
26:35;26:37;"- So let's get Uncle Ted on the phone."
26:37;26:40;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
26:40;26:43;"(phone ringing)"
26:43;26:45;"- Yes, man."
26:45;26:46;"- Ted."
26:46;26:47;"- That's right."
26:47;26:48;"- What's up, man?"
26:48;26:49;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
26:49;26:51;"- (laughs) Thank you."
26:51;26:52;"- How's it going, Ted?"
26:52;26:53;"This is Ezra."
26:53;26:54;"- I'm good, man."
26:54;26:56;"- I guess my first question, you know,"
26:56;26:57;"and I'm sure the audience wants to know too,"
26:57;27:00;"is how exactly are you guys related?"
27:00;27:04;"- Jake and Dave are both my sister's kids."
27:04;27:09;"She had these amazing two monster kids."
27:09;27:10;"I'm very proud of both of them."
27:10;27:11;"- Thanks, Ted, that's sweet."
27:11;27:14;"And how old were you when Jake was born?"
27:14;27:19;"- I was 16 in 1974 when Van Halen came out."
27:19;27:20;"Let's put it there."
27:20;27:23;"- So Jake was born in '77, so you were probably 19."
27:23;27:25;"- I was born in '58."
27:25;27:27;"- So you were growing up in Pasadena,"
27:27;27:28;"in the city of Pasadena?"
27:28;27:29;"- Absolutely."
27:29;27:32;"- Hold on a second, I gotta plug this phone in."
27:32;27:36;"I need power."
27:36;27:40;"All right, yeah, the whole Van Halen thing was so cool."
27:40;27:41;"I mean, Eddie was a legend,"
27:41;27:44;"and we had all kinds of guitar players"
27:44;27:48;"that were in his league that he pretty much blew away,"
27:48;27:51;"and they destroyed their careers."
27:51;27:52;"- You were like in high school,"
27:52;27:55;"and you were just hearing about this dude?"
27:55;27:56;"- Yeah."
27:56;27:57;"- Eddie Van Halen?"
27:57;27:59;"Did he like go to your high school?"
27:59;28:01;"- This is the bottom line with Van Halen."
28:01;28:02;"Quote me on this."
28:02;28:04;"They were the kings of the kegger."
28:04;28:06;"The best parties I've ever been to,"
28:06;28:11;"giant, monstrous, thousands of people parked for blocks."
28:11;28:14;"Then the police could do nothing about it."
28:14;28:16;"It was just insane."
28:16;28:17;"- I mean, this is the impression"
28:17;28:19;"that you always get from movies, like ""Dazed and Confused."""
28:19;28:22;"In the '70s, high school kids could basically"
28:22;28:25;"just throw gigantic parties with alcohol,"
28:25;28:26;"and it was kind of like,"
28:26;28:28;"it wasn't some huge scandalous thing."
28:28;28:29;"- For real."
28:29;28:31;"- And it didn't get shut down very often?"
28:31;28:32;"- Oh, it got shut down."
28:32;28:35;"The party would go on for like an hour,"
28:35;28:37;"and then the helicopters would show up,"
28:37;28:39;"and the cops would show up,"
28:39;28:41;"and the kids would scatter."
28:41;28:42;"We did it every weekend."
28:42;28:44;"- And there would be live music?"
28:44;28:46;"You're saying Van Halen actually like performs?"
28:46;28:48;"- Pretty much."
28:48;28:50;"I never saw Van Halen in a club."
28:50;28:53;"I always saw them in backyards,"
28:53;28:56;"at very large mansions,"
28:56;28:58;"very expensive properties,"
28:58;29:00;"and they probably made a lot of money."
29:00;29:01;"The keggers were just ridiculous."
29:01;29:05;"They'd have 10 kegs and 1,000 people."
29:05;29:06;"It was ridiculous."
29:06;29:08;"And they charged five bucks a head to get in,"
29:08;29:10;"and guys would, you know,"
29:10;29:12;"they'd stamp your hand at the gate, right?"
29:12;29:15;"And then guys would go out and wet their finger"
29:15;29:18;"and try to transfer their stamp"
29:18;29:21;"to the guy in the line to get 'em for free,"
29:21;29:24;"and then they'd both get thrown out."
29:24;29:25;"It was just, you know,"
29:28;29:30;"teenage monstrous ridiculousness."
29:30;29:32;"- And so you said that a lot of these parties"
29:32;29:33;"are happening at mansions."
29:33;29:36;"So Pasadena's generally a pretty wealthy town,"
29:36;29:38;"or is there like a right and wrong side"
29:38;29:40;"of the tracks kind of thing?"
29:40;29:42;"- Well, there's tracks in every town."
29:42;29:44;"Okay, there's one guy,"
29:44;29:47;"his parents' house was monstrous,"
29:47;29:52;"and he had a Van Halen party on their tennis court,"
29:52;29:54;"and they put up a huge stage,"
29:54;29:57;"and you know, this tennis court has a fence around it,"
29:57;29:59;"so the balls don't get up,"
29:59;30:01;"but you can fit probably 300 people"
30:01;30:04;"into the tennis court area where the stage was,"
30:04;30:07;"and Van Halen was throwing down."
30:07;30:09;"But the party was going on outside the gate,"
30:09;30:13;"and there was, I'm 16 years old, I'm 17 years old,"
30:13;30:16;"there's chicks everywhere."
30:16;30:19;"Everybody's free beer, Van Halen."
30:19;30:21;"It's ridiculous."
30:21;30:25;"It's like Woodstock in a really rich neighborhood"
30:25;30:26;"for a (beep) free."
30:27;30:28;"It's great."
30:28;30:29;"- Damn, I love the idea of Van Halen"
30:29;30:32;"just performing on a tennis court."
30:32;30:33;"- Yeah, man."
30:33;30:34;"- Tennis court metal."
30:34;30:39;"- They put up a pretty legit stage on a tennis court."

31:21;31:25;"It's the '80s, you're in your mid-20s,"
31:25;31:29;"and you're seeing the video for ""Jump"" on MTV."
31:29;31:30;"Do you have a sense of pride?"
31:30;31:32;"You're like, ""My boys made it."""
31:32;31:33;"Or are you done at that point?"
31:33;31:36;"- By that time, I'm in my band, The Pimps,"
31:36;31:38;"and we're doing funk music."
31:38;31:39;"- Great band."
31:39;31:41;"- So you were done with rock by that era?"
31:41;31:42;"- Oh, yeah."
31:42;31:43;"We all grow up, right?"
31:43;31:45;"- Ted, I feel like you cycled through rock"
31:45;31:49;"into punk briefly, and then you got really into funk"
31:49;31:50;"and jocko."
31:50;31:54;"- I was, while people were doing all the rock and roll,"
31:54;31:58;"I was kinda in the fusion jazz scene."
31:58;31:59;"- Yeah."
31:59;32:01;"- And I was like, Mahavishnu Orchestra"
32:01;32:04;"and John LuPonte."
32:04;32:07;"That came out of my love from Frank Zappa."
32:07;32:11;"Quick brush with greatness, I got to sit in a box"
32:11;32:14;"at the Hollywood Bowl with George Duke and eat dinner."
32:14;32:15;"(laughs)"
32:15;32:16;"- Legend."
32:16;32:18;"- So I will never forget that night."
32:18;32:20;"- But so as you're getting into all this fusion music"
32:20;32:23;"and stuff, were you not in to Van Halen anymore?"
32:23;32:27;"Or would you be buying like a 1986 Van Halen record?"
32:27;32:30;"- Okay, my father worked for Warner Brothers Records."
32:30;32:33;"Actually, he worked for Warner Brothers Studios."
32:33;32:38;"But he brought home boxes of records every month."
32:38;32:41;"And so we had every Warner Brothers release"
32:41;32:46;"that was ever released from like 1970 to 1990."
32:46;32:50;"Yeah, I take that back, '80."
32:50;32:52;"But anyway, yeah, I had all the LPs."
32:52;32:55;"- So you would keep up to some extent with Van Halen."
32:55;32:58;"- But the thing is, I was exposed to all kinds of music."
32:58;33:00;"My dad was a jazz lover."
33:00;33:02;"And he was from South Africa."
33:02;33:04;"Then I got interested in African music"
33:04;33:07;"and King Sunny a Day and Fela and all that (beep)"
33:07;33:10;"and then Jocko was all part of that too."
33:10;33:14;"And so it's just my world opened up as a bass player."
33:14;33:18;"It's just so many things to be fascinated by."
33:18;33:18;"- Sure."
33:18;33:21;"Ted, when did you first play the Old Town Pub?"
33:21;33:23;"- Okay, let's see."
33:23;33:25;"Early '80s probably."
33:25;33:28;"- Like did the Pimps?"
33:28;33:30;"- Oh, the Pimps definitely playing there, yeah."
33:30;33:31;"- Okay."
33:31;33:32;"- Yeah, it's so much fun."
33:32;33:33;"They're a great bar."
33:33;33:36;"And I played there for many, many years"
33:36;33:39;"for many, many different bar owners."
33:39;33:41;"- And now you come and see Richard Fichter's there"
33:41;33:42;"when we play."
33:42;33:46;"- And oh, sheesh, man."
33:46;33:48;"The backyard at the pub when you guys play there,"
33:48;33:51;"it just turns into ganja central."
33:51;33:51;"- Yeah."
33:51;33:54;"- And I have to brag at this point in the conversation,"
33:54;33:58;"Uncle Ted has grown a beautiful crop this year."
33:58;33:59;"- Nice, dude."
33:59;34:00;"(Ted laughing)"
34:00;34:03;"- Where do you grow it, inside or outside?"
34:03;34:04;"- Outside, yeah."
34:04;34:06;"Yeah, in fabric pots."
34:06;34:08;"- And just so everybody knows,"
34:08;34:09;"especially if you're a California resident,"
34:09;34:12;"I always forget, but in California,"
34:12;34:13;"you're allowed to grow weed."
34:13;34:16;"What's the maximum number of plants?"
34:16;34:17;"- Six."
34:17;34:18;"- Okay."
34:18;34:19;"- I grew seven."
34:19;34:21;"(both laughing)"
34:21;34:23;"- Nice, dude."
34:23;34:23;"- You're a rebel."
34:23;34:27;"- We've also adopted chickens."
34:27;34:29;"We're getting eggs every morning."
34:29;34:30;"- Whoa."
34:30;34:33;"- And we've got green onions going."
34:33;34:34;"We've got peppers."
34:34;34:38;"We're growing like, it's like farmer Ted over here."
34:38;34:40;"- Dude, I gotta pop by and check this out."
34:40;34:41;"- You should."
34:41;34:43;"- I love the idea of just like a functional farm"
34:43;34:47;"where it is chickens, vegetables, and weed."
34:47;34:49;"But back to rock and roll."
34:49;34:50;"- Yes."
34:50;34:52;"- There were several cats in Pasadena"
34:52;34:55;"that were guitar players that sort of rivals"
34:55;34:57;"Eddie Van Halen."
34:57;35:02;"They kind of warped, ruined their careers."
35:02;35:07;"Terry Kilgore had a band called Ready Killer Watt,"
35:07;35:09;"and they were just smoking."
35:09;35:14;"They played reggae music before it was even known here."
35:14;35:19;"And they had a cool chick singer named Debbie Diamond,"
35:19;35:24;"and they played just the same kind of backyard parties"
35:24;35:25;"that Van Halen did."
35:25;35:28;"But Eddie just killed them."
35:28;35:30;"(laughing)"
35:30;35:33;"And Eddie and Terry were good friends."
35:33;35:37;"And then there was another guy, a guy named Tom Tortomasi,"
35:37;35:40;"who I played with in SVDB."
35:40;35:43;"And Tom and Eddie were good friends."
35:43;35:46;"And he was friends with Kilgore as well."
35:46;35:50;"And that was like kind of a guitar triumvirate"
35:50;35:52;"in Pasadena in the early '70s."
35:52;35:54;"Those guys were badasses."
35:54;35:58;"And so it was cool to sort of know some of them."
35:58;35:59;"- Yeah, man."
35:59;36:02;"- I mean, I guess that's kind of just like, you know,"
36:02;36:04;"growing up like in the same high school league"
36:04;36:05;"as like Michael Jordan."
36:05;36:07;"- Had to mention them, man."
36:07;36:10;"They were formative influences."
36:10;36:12;"- Are those guys still out there?"
36:12;36:15;"- Terry, no, not really."
36:15;36:17;"- Well Ted, we gotta, thanks so much for calling on."
36:17;36:18;"We gotta wrap it up 'cause we got our next guest,"
36:18;36:22;"but where can people hear your music?"
36:22;36:23;"You got any new stuff up?"
36:23;36:28;"- T-E-D-K-N-E-C-H-T."
36:28;36:31;"And yeah, SoundCloud, Tech Connect."
36:31;36:33;"And I got some dubs up there."
36:33;36:34;"I've been working on 'em,"
36:34;36:37;"I'm trying to learn Ableton and stuff"
36:37;36:40;"and working with some cats all over the world."
36:40;36:42;"It's kind of fun."
36:42;36:43;"- That's sick."
36:43;36:45;"Well, we'll post the link on the Time Crisis Twitter."
36:45;36:48;"- Yeah, Ted, the stuff you sent today sounded sick."
36:48;36:50;"- Yeah, man, pump that link."
36:50;36:52;"- Will do, man."
36:52;36:56;"- Well, great to finally have you on the show, Ted."
36:56;36:58;"We'll hope you're calling again."
36:58;37:00;"- I appreciate you calling me, man."
37:00;37:01;"- All right, man."
37:01;37:02;"Ted, have a good one."
37:02;37:04;"- Uncle Ted, thanks."

38:05;38:07;"Now we have the legendary Spike Ferriston."
38:07;38:10;"He's written on all the legendary shows."
38:10;38:14;"Letterman, SNL, The Simpsons, and most notably Seinfeld,"
38:14;38:16;"where he wrote some very famous episodes,"
38:16;38:21;"including The Soup Nazi, The Muffin Tops, The Little Kicks,"
38:21;38:24;"which is the one where Elaine dances at her company party."
38:24;38:27;"He also hosted the late night talk show with Spike Ferriston"
38:27;38:29;"on Fox from 2006 to 2009."
38:29;38:31;"He's got a podcast, Spike's Car Radio,"
38:31;38:35;"and he also hosts a TV show, Car Matchmaker,"
38:35;38:36;"on Esquire Network."
38:36;38:37;"Let's get him on the horn."
38:37;38:39;"Oh, and of course, as Seinfeld pointed out,"
38:39;38:43;"he co-wrote Bee Movie with Jerry, absolute legend."
38:43;38:46;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
38:46;38:50;"(phone ringing)"
38:50;38:51;"- Hey, Spike."
38:51;38:52;"- Hey, guys."
38:52;38:53;"- Welcome to Time Crisis."
38:53;38:54;"We're so happy to have you on."
38:54;38:56;"We really appreciate you taking the time."
38:56;38:57;"We always record late,"
38:57;38:59;"and you're in the middle of watching the World Series."
38:59;39:01;"So what's going on?"
39:01;39:03;"- Dodgers are down by a couple runs,"
39:03;39:06;"but this is my adopted team."
39:06;39:08;"I'm really a Boston Red Sox fan."
39:08;39:09;"You know, I like the Dodgers"
39:09;39:12;"'cause this is where my kids are growing up."
39:12;39:13;"- I've always wondered about that."
39:13;39:16;"Isn't it very easy to tell your children"
39:16;39:19;"your heritage lies in Boston,"
39:19;39:20;"and that's who you're gonna support,"
39:20;39:21;"that's who dad likes?"
39:21;39:22;"- It doesn't work."
39:22;39:24;"They are Red Sox fans"
39:24;39:27;"because they know my heart is with the Red Sox."
39:27;39:29;"But I do love the LA fans."
39:29;39:30;"I've lived in Los Angeles now longer"
39:30;39:33;"than I've lived anywhere else in the world."
39:33;39:34;"And I've seen the Red Sox win."
39:34;39:36;"You know, I've seen them do it a bunch of times"
39:36;39:37;"after not winning for decades."
39:37;39:41;"So I really want LA and the Dodgers"
39:41;39:43;"to have that win for all the folks"
39:43;39:45;"who've been waiting for the Dodgers to get it again."
39:45;39:46;"- And this could be their year."
39:46;39:49;"- It could be, but isn't it weird year to win anything?"
39:49;39:53;"- Yeah, I mean, will there literally be an asterisk"
39:53;39:55;"in the history books?"
39:55;39:57;"- No, but when they win,"
39:57;39:59;"I've been wondering, will the cardboard cutouts move"
39:59;40:01;"and go, yay, up and down?"
40:01;40:02;"And will they throw them off the field?"
40:02;40:05;"I mean, how is that celebrated?"
40:05;40:08;"I know that the rioting will probably be real."
40:08;40:12;"But it's just such a, I don't know."
40:12;40:15;"I don't know that I'd wanna win the World Series this year."
40:15;40:16;"You know what I mean?"
40:16;40:18;"- I'm not a huge baseball guy,"
40:18;40:20;"but I think there should be an asterisk"
40:20;40:24;"because part of the stress of playing the World Series"
40:24;40:26;"in any baseball game is being surrounded"
40:26;40:28;"by tens of thousands of hardcore fans."
40:28;40:29;"- That is true."
40:29;40:33;"I know this guy, CJ Wilson, who pitched for the Angels."
40:33;40:35;"And I ask him all sorts of questions like that,"
40:35;40:37;"but one of the things I asked him was,"
40:37;40:40;"out of all the kids who finally make it to the majors,"
40:40;40:43;"what percentage gets onto that mound?"
40:43;40:46;"And this is right after I had thrown a first pitch"
40:46;40:48;"at an Angels game and felt the weight"
40:48;40:50;"of being at the center of something like that"
40:50;40:52;"and how stressful it was."
40:52;40:54;"What percentage of guys get to the mound"
40:54;40:55;"and then fall apart?"
40:55;40:58;"And he said a very high percentage of guys do."
40:58;40:59;"That they may have the talent,"
40:59;41:02;"but they just don't have the psychology to pull it off."
41:02;41:04;"Have you ever thrown out a first pitch?"
41:04;41:07;"I'm sad to say the offers never even come across my desk."
41:07;41:08;"- It's not a big deal,"
41:08;41:10;"but they have usually a bunch of guys."
41:10;41:12;"I did it once for a small game."
41:12;41:13;"It wasn't like the crowd."
41:13;41:16;"But when I walked out there and I look,"
41:16;41:18;"and my friend CJ was catching,"
41:18;41:22;"it's like you're in a zoo and everybody's staring at you"
41:22;41:24;"in that cage and the fans,"
41:24;41:29;"you're at the center and the stress point of the whole game"
41:29;41:30;"and you feel it."
41:30;41:33;"And I threw this, whatever, I threw a strike or ball,"
41:33;41:33;"I don't remember."
41:33;41:34;"I just remember going,"
41:34;41:36;"""God, I really want to see my family right now."
41:36;41:38;"""I want to get off this mound."
41:38;41:39;"""I want to get off this field."""
41:39;41:41;"- I can only imagine."
41:41;41:43;"- Yeah, I just want to eat a hot dog."
41:43;41:44;"- Oh, I bet."
41:44;41:45;"Anyway, that's enough sports talk."
41:45;41:47;"(laughing)"
41:47;41:50;"- Do you know that a member of our crew on the show,"
41:50;41:52;"his name's Seinfeld 2000?"
41:52;41:54;"- I did know that, yes."
41:54;41:56;"But I don't know which box it is."
41:56;41:57;"- It's me in the box."
41:57;41:59;"I might be in the bottom corner of your screen."
41:59;42:01;"Spike, thanks for coming on Time Crisis."
42:01;42:03;"- Oh, that's the little box, okay."
42:03;42:05;"- Yeah, hi, how you doing?"
42:05;42:06;"(laughing)"
42:06;42:07;"- Oh, there you are."
42:07;42:08;"- Hi."
42:08;42:09;"- You're Seinfeld 2000."
42:09;42:12;"I can never tell what's real Seinfeld Twitter feeds"
42:12;42:13;"and what's fake Seinfeld."
42:13;42:15;"I assume you might be even a real guy."
42:15;42:17;"I know there's another guy."
42:17;42:19;"Are you the guy who's writing the new stories,"
42:19;42:21;"the new modern stories?"
42:21;42:23;"- I mean, that's part of what it is."
42:23;42:24;"It's kind of like--"
42:24;42:25;"- Well, I'll chime in."
42:25;42:26;"- Oh, thanks, Ezra."
42:26;42:28;"- The fastest way to describe"
42:28;42:29;"where Seinfeld 2000 comes from"
42:29;42:34;"is that there was a guy who started doing the modern stories"
42:34;42:37;"and Seinfeld, as a deep Seinfeld fan,"
42:37;42:39;"found that to be so corny"
42:39;42:41;"and disrespectful of the source material"
42:41;42:46;"that he started a kind of unhinged Twitter persona"
42:46;42:48;"that became its own thing,"
42:48;42:49;"but started out making fun"
42:49;42:52;"of the new Seinfeld Twitter account"
42:52;42:54;"and eventually became a kind of meme,"
42:54;42:58;"bizarre meme account that created its own universe."
42:58;43:00;"And he was the first person ever"
43:00;43:02;"to take footage from the real world,"
43:02;43:04;"like Chris Christie sitting next to Seinfeld"
43:04;43:07;"and do the curb your enthusiasm push."
43:07;43:11;"- Are you @Seinfeld2000?"
43:11;43:12;"- Yeah, that's me."
43:12;43:15;"Spike, you retweeted me, I think, a few days ago."
43:15;43:17;"- Oh, the little kicks."
43:17;43:18;"- The little kicks, which you wrote."
43:18;43:20;"- I can't believe how my episodes"
43:20;43:22;"are turning up with the Lincoln Project."
43:22;43:24;"You know, the soup Nazi was the other day,"
43:24;43:26;"then the little kicks."
43:26;43:29;"- It's so odd to keep seeing this stuff happen."
43:29;43:31;"- Let's break this down for the listeners."
43:31;43:32;"So the little kicks,"
43:32;43:37;"Elaine goes to her company party with George"
43:37;43:41;"and he sees that she's an insanely terrible dancer,"
43:41;43:44;"which is what the little kicks refer to one of her moves."
43:44;43:45;"Right?"
43:45;43:46;"She's doing these little kicks"
43:46;43:49;"and she doesn't realize what a terrible dancer she is"
43:49;43:51;"and George cannot believe it."
43:51;43:53;"Seinfeld, you're kind of our meme correspondent."
43:53;43:54;"The reason that this is back out"
43:54;43:56;"in the public consciousness"
43:56;43:58;"is because people are comparing Trump's dance moves"
43:58;44:00;"to Elaine's little kicks."
44:00;44:02;"- Yeah, yeah, President Donald J. Trump"
44:02;44:04;"has recently been like doing,"
44:04;44:05;"(laughing)"
44:05;44:06;"pulling out these-"
44:06;44:07;"- I still laugh when people say that, but go ahead."
44:07;44:10;"(laughing)"
44:10;44:11;"- I don't know what's going on,"
44:11;44:13;"but there's some sort of collapse happening"
44:13;44:15;"where recently at rallies,"
44:15;44:19;"he's been doing these very unusual dances to YMCA."
44:19;44:22;"It seems like some sort of sign that, I don't know,"
44:22;44:23;"maybe the end is near."
44:23;44:24;"I don't know."
44:24;44:26;"But I guess it had been remarked on"
44:26;44:28;"that some of these moves that he was doing"
44:28;44:30;"were very like herky-jerky"
44:30;44:32;"and seemed very much like the motions"
44:32;44:36;"that Elaine was doing when she did the little kicks."
44:36;44:38;"And so I had tweeted out a split screen"
44:38;44:41;"of the two things happening simultaneously."
44:41;44:43;"And then the Lincoln Project, as you said,"
44:43;44:46;"kind of like did the thing where they tweet the video."
44:46;44:49;"And then Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the queen herself,"
44:49;44:50;"added her own commentary."
44:50;44:51;"And it was like a big-"
44:51;44:52;"- Oh, good."
44:52;44:53;"- Yeah, it was a big moment."
44:53;44:55;"- So the Lincoln Project was kind of retweeting you,"
44:55;44:56;"Seinfeld?"
44:56;44:57;"- Yeah."
44:57;44:58;"- Or they just stole your content?"
44:58;45:00;"- No, they do steal a lot of content,"
45:00;45:01;"but this time they did the thing"
45:01;45:04;"where you can kind of like sample the original video"
45:04;45:06;"so that the credit still goes to the original."
45:06;45:07;"It's very tedious to talk about."
45:07;45:08;"- Okay, all right."
45:08;45:11;"- But I have no qualms with the way"
45:11;45:14;"the Lincoln Project handled this one."
45:14;45:15;"But yeah, it's sort of like,"
45:15;45:17;"it got pushed through the Lincoln Project"
45:17;45:20;"and then Julia Louis-Dreyfus retweeted it."
45:20;45:22;"And it was, you know, it really made my week."
45:22;45:24;"- Yeah, well, all right."
45:24;45:26;"Shout out to the Lincoln Project,"
45:26;45:27;"a group of Republicans who are-"
45:27;45:30;"(laughing)"
45:30;45:30;"- Cool with George W. Bush."
45:30;45:33;"- They do the best ads, they're so good."
45:33;45:36;"- Ronald Reagan, the, you know, the rack war."
45:36;45:37;"- What is it?"
45:37;45:40;"It's like the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing."
45:40;45:42;"I think that's kind of what's going on."
45:42;45:43;"- The only one we have right now."
45:43;45:44;"- Right, exactly."
45:44;45:45;"(laughing)"
45:45;45:47;"- You just gotta hold onto him."
45:47;45:48;"- Right."
45:48;45:49;"So Spike, this is,"
45:49;45:50;"I'm sure you've answered this a million times,"
45:50;45:53;"but this is kind of a basic question is,"
45:53;45:55;"let's use the little kicks for instance."
45:55;45:57;"On a TV show like Seinfeld,"
45:57;45:59;"and you came in in the last two seasons"
45:59;46:00;"or last three seasons, something like that."
46:00;46:01;"- Three, season seven."
46:01;46:04;"- When you write an episode,"
46:04;46:05;"like how does that come about?"
46:05;46:06;"Does that mean that,"
46:06;46:07;"did you get to write it"
46:07;46:09;"because you threw out the original idea?"
46:09;46:13;"Was it assigned to you 'cause it was your turn to do it?"
46:13;46:15;"Did it all get cooked up together,"
46:15;46:16;"but you're the one who put words to paper"
46:16;46:19;"and kind of formalized it?"
46:19;46:20;"What was going on back then?"
46:20;46:22;"- No, we would come in with the stories."
46:22;46:23;"- Okay."
46:23;46:24;"- It was pretty much the qualification."
46:24;46:25;"You had to come in with stories,"
46:25;46:27;"ideally from your life,"
46:27;46:28;"things that had happened to you"
46:28;46:31;"that you thought were odd"
46:31;46:32;"or perhaps made you mad,"
46:32;46:35;"and maybe you didn't say what you wanted to say,"
46:35;46:37;"but you're telling Larry and Jerry,"
46:37;46:39;"but here's what I wanted to do."
46:39;46:40;"She said this to me,"
46:40;46:42;"and here's what I wanted to do."
46:42;46:43;"So the very first story I was telling"
46:43;46:45;"was the story of this guy who sold soup"
46:45;46:47;"and everybody called him the Soup Nazi,"
46:47;46:49;"and if you didn't follow the rules,"
46:49;46:50;"he would scream at you,"
46:50;46:52;"and then Larry started laughing right away."
46:52;46:53;"He goes, ""The Soup Nazi?"
46:53;46:55;"""What did they, is a guy they called?"""
46:55;46:56;"You know, and he goes, ""This is your first story."""
46:56;46:58;"And I go, ""I'm not pitching."
46:58;47:00;"""I was just telling you what's going on in New York"
47:00;47:01;"""where we got lunch every day."""
47:01;47:04;"That's your first story, and they throw you out."
47:04;47:05;"So you would then take that and go,"
47:05;47:07;"all right, well, whose story is it?"
47:07;47:11;"You know, out of these four characters, who's who?"
47:11;47:13;"Well, George is gonna be arrogant enough to go,"
47:13;47:15;"""Look, I know how to order soup, right?"""
47:15;47:16;"Which really is me."
47:16;47:18;"That's what I did when someone told me about it."
47:18;47:20;"I became George, and then I became Jerry,"
47:20;47:21;"which is, look, trust me,"
47:21;47:24;"you gotta know what you're doing here."
47:24;47:26;"And you know, Elaine, of course,"
47:26;47:29;"the guy's a misogynist, she wouldn't put up with it."
47:29;47:31;"And Kramer, a kindred spirit, right?"
47:31;47:34;"He's a misunderstood genius, this guy."
47:34;47:36;"You would start with those ideas"
47:36;47:39;"and see if you could get to the act break, right?"
47:39;47:40;"And in this particular case,"
47:40;47:43;"the act break bumped into the other story, Shmoopy,"
47:43;47:47;"and all I knew was that Jerry has to make a choice,"
47:47;47:49;"he has to choose between the soup or the girl,"
47:49;47:50;"and he chooses the soup."
47:50;47:53;"So that's where I knew I was going."
47:53;47:55;"And then you would map out act one and the scenes"
47:55;47:57;"and the basic idea of what's gonna happen in it."
47:57;47:59;"You're not typing, dry erase boards."
47:59;48:02;"And then you'd bring Larry and Jerry in and go,"
48:02;48:03;"""Here's what I've got."""
48:03;48:06;"And they would throw in ideas."
48:06;48:08;"Before that, you'd bring in the other writers,"
48:08;48:09;"you know, guys, Gamble and Pross,"
48:09;48:11;"Berg and Shae for those guys."
48:11;48:13;"It was very collaborative in that way."
48:13;48:15;"They'd hang out in my office for an hour,"
48:15;48:17;"we'd go over theirs, and we'd talk out these stories"
48:17;48:22;"until you had a solid act one approved by Larry and Jerry"
48:22;48:24;"and a direction for act two."
48:24;48:25;"And who cares about the ending?"
48:25;48:27;"Nobody cares right now."
48:27;48:29;"And then if you had that,"
48:29;48:31;"and Larry and Jerry liked where it was going,"
48:31;48:33;"they would send you to script and you'd do a first draft."
48:33;48:37;"Second draft, they'd keep reading, they'd keep noting,"
48:37;48:39;"and then eventually they'd go, ""You know what?"
48:39;48:41;"""Close enough."
48:41;48:42;"""We're gonna shoot it."
48:42;48:44;"""Let us do our pass."""
48:44;48:46;"And that's where it went from, you know,"
48:46;48:51;"75% to 110%, if there's such a thing, right?"
48:51;48:54;"The real Jerry and George would take it by themselves"
48:54;48:57;"and jam on it in that, that's how season seven worked."
48:57;49:00;"In season eight, it became more collaborative."
49:00;49:03;"We would have teams of four writers working on a script"
49:03;49:06;"and whoever's script it was would EP it."
49:06;49:08;"So essentially, if it was my script,"
49:08;49:10;"I would be the EP for that week"
49:10;49:12;"and I would, you know, pick my little team of writers"
49:12;49:14;"and Jerry and I would do it."
49:14;49:16;"- It changed because Larry was gone."
49:16;49:18;"- Larry took off, yeah, yeah."
49:18;49:20;"He left after season seven."
49:20;49:23;"So, you know, again, the guiding principle, though,"
49:23;49:26;"that Larry and Jerry put out was really amazing,"
49:26;49:29;"which was we don't want you to make up stupid stories"
49:29;49:32;"about who dates who or what happened."
49:32;49:35;"We want you to bring in real stories from your life,"
49:35;49:38;"ideally from New York, where I had just moved from,"
49:38;49:40;"and just tell us those stories"
49:40;49:42;"and let us decide whether it's something or not."
49:42;49:45;"I mean, you could exact revenges on friends."
49:45;49:48;"You could have so much fun with that thing."
49:48;49:51;"You know, I remember the minute Jeff Schafer's like,"
49:51;49:54;"you gotta listen to my friend's answering machine message."
49:54;49:55;"And it was that, believe it or not,"
49:55;49:57;"I'm not gonna be home."
49:57;49:58;"Some girly dude."
49:58;49:59;"- Classic."
49:59;50:02;"- And we would play it, you know, every day before we wrote,"
50:02;50:04;"we were like, play the answering machine message."
50:04;50:06;"And eventually we were so entertained, you know,"
50:06;50:08;"George, let's give that to George."
50:08;50:09;"Think about how small that is."
50:09;50:11;"That's just a girl living in Sherman Oaks"
50:11;50:14;"who made a bad decision for her answering machine."
50:14;50:16;"And then we shoot the episode"
50:16;50:18;"and Schafer and I closed the door"
50:18;50:19;"and the night it's gonna air on NBC,"
50:19;50:22;"we just call her and go, watch ""Seinfeld"" tonight."
50:22;50:23;"Just hang the phone up."
50:23;50:25;"(laughing)"
50:25;50:28;"She had, you know, her mind was blown, of course,"
50:28;50:32;"but you know, it was a really fun little environment"
50:32;50:33;"to work in."
50:33;50:35;"You know, I've never worked on anything like it since,"
50:35;50:36;"really."

51:08;51:11;"- So with ""The Little Kicks,"" is there also like a story?"
51:11;51:12;"- Yeah, it's Lorne Michaels."
51:12;51:13;"It's Lorne Michaels when I was working"
51:13;51:15;"at ""Saturday Night Live."""
51:15;51:16;"I was an intern there"
51:16;51:18;"and he was a very intimidating character to me,"
51:18;51:20;"not because of how he acted,"
51:20;51:22;"just because I had grown up watching the show"
51:22;51:26;"and I was, you know, if he's the guy running the show,"
51:26;51:29;"I'm the intern and the receptionist."
51:29;51:30;"So it's like, you know,"
51:30;51:33;"and I'd never seen anybody in show business"
51:33;51:35;"and he was, I just, I couldn't even look at him."
51:35;51:36;"I was intimidated."
51:36;51:40;"And then one night I saw him at the party dancing,"
51:40;51:42;"doing the dance that Elaine is doing."
51:42;51:44;"Very accurate."
51:44;51:48;"With these little kicks and-"
51:48;51:50;"- Like that extreme, that ridiculous?"
51:50;51:52;"- The kicks were the primary,"
51:52;51:55;"those were in the script, the kicks."
51:55;51:55;"That's what it's called."
51:55;51:56;"- Specifically the kicks."
51:56;51:59;"- He was doing this little kick thing."
51:59;52:01;"Julia, of course, took it to a new level,"
52:01;52:03;"but she didn't take it that much higher"
52:03;52:05;"than it already was."
52:05;52:06;"You know, I kind of admired Lorne"
52:06;52:08;"that he was just out there."
52:08;52:09;"He may or may not know,"
52:09;52:11;"but probably knew he wasn't that great of a dancer."
52:11;52:13;"And he was just, who cares?"
52:13;52:14;"Having a good time out there."
52:14;52:16;"But, you know, right away when I saw him"
52:16;52:19;"and some of the other, you know, PAs were like,"
52:19;52:20;"oh, he's not so scary anymore."
52:20;52:21;"He's human, right?"
52:21;52:23;"It kind of humanized him."
52:23;52:25;"And for the story with Elaine,"
52:25;52:28;"she at the time was running, you know, was a boss."
52:28;52:30;"And we thought that'll be an interesting thing"
52:30;52:30;"for her to play."
52:30;52:34;"You know, she's got control and then she loses control."
52:34;52:35;"And we changed it."
52:35;52:36;"We exaggerated it a little bit,"
52:36;52:38;"but that was the basic idea."
52:38;52:40;"- Spike, were there any stories from like your real life"
52:40;52:43;"that you thought, oh, this is really like a gold,"
52:43;52:45;"like this is perfect fodder for a plot line"
52:45;52:47;"that you pitched to Larry and Jerry"
52:47;52:49;"and they just weren't feeling it at all?"
52:49;52:50;"- Oh yeah."
52:50;52:51;"Yeah. - What could have been?"
52:51;52:52;"- The little kicks was the,"
52:52;52:53;"I pitched that in the first season"
52:53;52:55;"and Larry didn't understand it."
52:55;52:57;"And it, you know, I get, it's hard."
52:57;52:59;"These stories are really hard"
52:59;53:02;"to see how they're going to be funny, right?"
53:02;53:03;"And Larry would do the same for me."
53:03;53:05;"I remember a story falling out and he goes,"
53:05;53:08;"""You know what, just come up with a blazer story."""
53:08;53:10;"And I was like, ""What the are you talking about?"
53:10;53:12;"What is a blazer story?"""
53:12;53:14;"He goes, ""All right, I don't know what this is,"
53:14;53:16;"but I think it's going to be funny."""
53:16;53:19;"I went to Barney's and I tried on this crested blazer"
53:19;53:20;"and I thought it was cool."
53:20;53:22;"And then I realized it wasn't cool."
53:22;53:23;"And I said, ""You know what?"
53:23;53:23;"I don't want this."""
53:23;53:25;"And the guy made me feel like I couldn't afford it."
53:25;53:27;"So I bought it out of spite."
53:27;53:29;"(laughing)"
53:29;53:31;"And then I had this expensive blazer I didn't want"
53:31;53:33;"and I wanted to return it,"
53:33;53:34;"but I was too afraid to return it."
53:34;53:36;"But I wanted to return it."
53:36;53:39;"And that became that crested blazer story of his."
53:39;53:40;"And I was dubious."
53:40;53:44;"I did not believe that he had a real story."
53:44;53:47;"But yet when we shot it, I was like, ""Right."""
53:47;53:50;"You know, the smaller these things are, the better,"
53:50;53:53;"but they're really difficult to see."
53:53;53:55;"You know, it's hard to put your faith"
53:55;53:57;"in a little story like that."
53:57;53:59;"So, you know, I didn't blame Larry at all for that."
53:59;54:01;"And I was happy to kind of repitch it."
54:01;54:04;"You know, I can't take my mind off Jeffrey Toobin right now."
54:04;54:05;"You know, that's the one."
54:05;54:07;"(laughing)"
54:07;54:08;"- I bet."
54:08;54:11;"- Boy, Zoom and those etiquettes,"
54:11;54:14;"and here's a guy who's touching himself."
54:14;54:18;"It's, you know, that's a great little story area."
54:18;54:20;"I'm guessing Curb is gonna hit this stuff, you know,"
54:20;54:21;"every which way."
54:21;54:24;"The name, the unfortunate name, Toobin."
54:24;54:25;"(laughing)"
54:25;54:26;"- Right."
54:26;54:28;"- We thought Anthony Weiner was the end of it."
54:28;54:29;"Now we've got Toobin."
54:29;54:32;"I've been thinking a lot about harebrained kind of,"
54:33;54:35;"you know, these scooter sharing programs"
54:35;54:38;"really make me laugh 'cause they're handing things"
54:38;54:40;"that people are killing themselves on."
54:40;54:42;"Just going, ""Hey, it's Silicon Valley."
54:42;54:44;"""We don't have to follow the rules."""
54:44;54:46;"You know, it never turns off."
54:46;54:48;"- There's a great, really small moment"
54:48;54:51;"in the new season of Curb where Larry is just like"
54:51;54:52;"strolling down the street with Leon"
54:52;54:54;"and there are those scooter shares"
54:54;54:57;"and he just knocks over a whole rack of them."
54:57;55:00;"It was such a small thing that they don't even comment on."
55:00;55:02;"- There are a lot of guys on Instagram"
55:02;55:05;"who that's their whole feed."
55:05;55:05;"It's great."
55:05;55:08;"It's just people, scooters behaving badly is one of them"
55:08;55:11;"and they're just kicking scooters over all day long."
55:11;55:12;"It's really wonderful."
55:12;55:15;"But you know, it's more about the arrogance"
55:15;55:17;"of Silicon Valley and just doing (beep)"
55:17;55:19;"we don't have to follow the rules, right?"
55:19;55:22;"That hasn't been written about enough, comedically."
55:22;55:24;"- That is also one of the things you're just like,"
55:24;55:25;"""Why is this allowed?"""
55:25;55:27;"- It's not."
55:27;55:29;"Their whole attitude is it's not."
55:29;55:33;"They just do it and hope that we'll love the stuff enough"
55:33;55:35;"that later when the fines come"
55:35;55:37;"that the cities will negotiate."
55:37;55:39;"- And they'll have so much money"
55:39;55:41;"they can pay the fines and pay the politicians."
55:41;55:43;"- Yeah, I was talking to Jerry just today"
55:43;55:45;"and he was like, ""Do you have these motorized"
55:45;55:47;"""or electric scooters?"
55:47;55:48;"""These ride on ones?"""
55:48;55:51;"He said, he goes, ""I saw like a dad with two kids,"
55:51;55:54;"""no helmets, just whizzing in and out of traffic."""
55:54;55:55;"And I'm like, ""How does it happen?"""
55:55;55:56;"He goes, ""I don't know."
55:56;55:57;"""I don't know what's happened."
55:57;56:00;"""They just dumped the scooters in Times Square, Spike."
56:00;56:01;"""What are they doing?"""
56:01;56:02;"(laughing)"
56:02;56:04;"And that's where it starts."
56:04;56:06;"And then we went on a long Tuban."
56:06;56:10;"We were talking about Tuban and how the funny part of,"
56:10;56:15;"is it okay to speak however I wish to speak here?"
56:15;56:16;"Do you have any sort of censorship?"
56:16;56:17;"- Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
56:17;56:21;"- We're talking about the fallout from (beep) to Zoom"
56:21;56:24;"when Russ from accounting suddenly comes full on your screen"
56:24;56:25;"at a peak moment."
56:25;56:27;"(laughing)"
56:27;56:29;"How's Tuban?"
56:29;56:30;"How is he timing stuff out?"
56:30;56:33;"(laughing)"
56:33;56:35;"- Do you think Tuban comes back from this?"
56:35;56:37;"Is there a Tuban comeback or is Tuban done?"
56:37;56:38;"- No, Tuban's done."
56:38;56:39;"Tuban's a meme at this point."
56:39;56:43;"- So Spike, now you have a podcast and a TV show about cars."
56:43;56:46;"- Yes, that show is no longer on the air"
56:46;56:47;"'cause the network got canceled."
56:47;56:48;"(laughing)"
56:48;56:49;"- Oh, they canceled the whole network?"
56:49;56:50;"- They canceled the network."
56:50;56:53;"The show's fine, but there's no network."
56:53;56:56;"You know, I thought I had seen everything in entertainment,"
56:56;56:58;"but I've never seen the show be a hit"
56:58;56:59;"and the network get canceled."
56:59;57:01;"That's a first for me."
57:01;57:02;"- Where can one watch it now?"
57:02;57:05;"- We have three seasons up, you know, on whatever sites."
57:05;57:07;"It's still shown around the world and stuff,"
57:07;57:11;"but you know, the whole car thing is just a hobby of mine."
57:11;57:14;"I'm, you know, still in entertainment."
57:14;57:17;"I have a scripted, an unscripted TV company."
57:17;57:18;"I'm writing scripted comedy."
57:18;57:20;"I'm working on a movie right now."
57:20;57:23;"The car thing is just a distraction that started back"
57:23;57:25;"when I was writing for Letterman."
57:25;57:27;"Dave likes cars and that's what we were kind of doing"
57:27;57:29;"in our downtime, just looking at cars"
57:29;57:30;"'cause he never leave the office."
57:30;57:33;"And then when I went to Seinfeld, it was the same thing."
57:33;57:36;"Who drove it in the old Porsche?"
57:36;57:38;"Hi, new writer, Spike Fersen."
57:38;57:39;"Oh, great, come here."
57:39;57:40;"You gotta get rid of that car though."
57:40;57:41;"It's a piece of (beep)"
57:41;57:42;"Like what?"
57:42;57:44;"(laughing)"
57:44;57:45;"Just don't fire me, dude."
57:45;57:48;"So, you know, the whole car thing"
57:48;57:50;"looks bigger than it actually is."
57:50;57:51;"Let me just put it that way, but I love it."
57:51;57:53;"It's my golf."
57:53;57:57;"On this show, I don't think anybody is truly a car guy,"
57:57;58:00;"but we have talked about cars once or twice."
58:00;58:02;"We don't know what we're talking about at all."
58:02;58:03;"We're definitely out of our depth,"
58:03;58:08;"but I've always felt like I'm missing a well of experience"
58:08;58:10;"or information to make like, you know,"
58:10;58:13;"I got strong opinions about music and movies"
58:13;58:16;"and I can compare things and say, well, that sucks."
58:16;58:19;"But when it comes to cars, I feel like it's a language"
58:19;58:20;"I don't totally understand."
58:20;58:21;"I'll throw something at you."
58:21;58:23;"Lately, I've met a couple of cool people"
58:23;58:28;"who are very into vintage Land Cruisers."
58:28;58:29;"And there's something about that there."
58:29;58:31;"I was like, oh, that's interesting."
58:31;58:32;"Being into a Toyota Land Cruiser."
58:32;58:34;"And then you look at them,"
58:34;58:35;"they kind of have an interesting history."
58:35;58:38;"So I'm curious, to you, what does it connote"
58:38;58:42;"to be into a vintage Toyota Land Cruiser,"
58:42;58:44;"like a 60s or 70s Land Cruiser?"
58:44;58:45;"- Those are great."
58:45;58:47;"I mean, they're very popular trucks."
58:47;58:49;"What's different about them and a Range Rover?"
58:49;58:51;"- Well, Land Rover, I have an old Land Rover."
58:51;58:53;"It's like any guitar that someone chooses."
58:53;58:55;"There's so much great stuff."
58:55;58:59;"Like for me, the car thing is not, I like Jay Leno a lot."
58:59;59:00;"I'm not a car guy like Jay Leno."
59:00;59:02;"I'm not interested in how engines work."
59:02;59:05;"And I get bored during these technical presentations."
59:05;59:09;"I'm more interested in the experience of using the vehicle."
59:09;59:12;"Like the car thing for me began when I had a vehicle"
59:12;59:16;"to drive away from my parents and to put my friends in"
59:16;59:20;"and smoke a little weed and listen to Led Zeppelin"
59:20;59:23;"and Madison Square Garden on the radio"
59:23;59:24;"in the middle of the woods."
59:24;59:26;"Like to me, that was like, wow, cars."
59:26;59:27;"(laughing)"
59:27;59:28;"Right? - Right."
59:28;59:29;"- 'Cause I get away."
59:29;59:31;"And then later on, it became a way to just be"
59:31;59:33;"with your friends and get out of the house."
59:33;59:36;"So I've always just loved vehicles"
59:36;59:38;"because they do things like that."
59:38;59:42;"The car community wraps its arms around pretty much anybody"
59:42;59:44;"at any level, whatever car they like."
59:44;59:47;"If you like driving around in your Prius, that's cool."
59:47;59:49;"Whatever, man, whatever you like."
59:49;59:53;"The Land Cruiser guys, those do really well at auction."
59:53;59:55;"And they have a big audience around the world."
59:55;59:58;"- What's like the (beep) car that you're into?"
59:58;59:59;"- That I'm into?"
59:59;01:00:01;"Then it wouldn't be a (beep) car."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Like, what do you mean?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- What's like the lowest level, least fancy,"
01:00:04;01:00:09;"least celebrated car that you have a personal affinity for?"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"That does, the cars that don't do well at auction,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"that don't even go to auction."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Is there, you know?"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"- I don't know that I like cars like that."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"I can't remember posting something"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"that people were actually upset about."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"(laughing)"
01:00:23;01:00:28;"- Or just like, I mean, this is just like a '92 Mercury Sable."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Is that when you're like, you know, say what you will."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- I would not be passionate."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"No, I wouldn't be passionate about that."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I might buy a Ford Granada"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"because my dad had one growing up"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"that was filled with cigarette butts"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"and had cigarette holes in the seats."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"And that would be personal to me"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"and I would get made fun of for that."
01:00:43;01:00:46;"It's not at all collectible in any way."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"And it's a horrific vehicle."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"There is a car that I owned in New York"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"that is laughed at now,"
01:00:52;01:00:55;"the Maserati Bi-Turbo that Chrysler was involved in."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"It was a horrible, horrible car that broke down constantly."
01:00:59;01:01:03;"And I am made fun of for that, owning that car."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"- Isn't Maserati like super high-end?"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"- No, not necessarily. - No."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"- Not at that period when they were making these things."
01:01:11;01:01:14;"- Is there a minivan that people covet?"
01:01:14;01:01:18;"- Yeah, people like the Honda Odyssey a lot."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"They're pretty passionate about that."
01:01:20;01:01:20;"- I've had two of those."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"Yeah, but those aren't collectibles."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"- No, collectible things tend to be something"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"that numbers in the, let's say,"
01:01:28;01:01:33;"let's just call this line 1,500 made per year, right?"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"And ideally you're talking about cars,"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"one to maybe 20 were made are the most collectible things."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Anything that's a production car"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"where they're making tens of thousands,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"then you're talking about you have to have"
01:01:46;01:01:50;"the best of the best with the lowest mileage,"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"perfect condition deal for it to be collectible."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"But they're out there, right?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"But it's never gonna happen with like Toyotas"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"and Hondas, Celicas, things like that."
01:02:00;01:02:05;"Honda Accords, those are just cars that we buy to use"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"to get on with life and they get stolen a lot."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"- Right, there's never been like a surprise comeback"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"in the car community."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"The way that somebody's like, ""Are you kidding me?"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"All those comic books."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"I threw out all my kids' comic books from the '60s."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Now you're telling me this is worth,"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"well, who would have thought that cost a nickel?"""
01:02:21;01:02:23;"There's no car version of that?"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- No. - Like a Mazda Miata?"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"- A Miata's have a pretty healthy, they're raced a lot."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"And so people make fun of them,"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"but they're the most raced car in the world."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"So for instance, my 12 year old right now is like,"
01:02:34;01:02:37;"""Dad, we have to get a '94 Miata."""
01:02:37;01:02:40;"So I can hot rod it and maybe we can race it."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"I'm like, ""Yeah, okay, I'll go right upstairs after this"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"and try to find you one."""

01:03:54;01:03:56;"- What's your take on the PT Cruiser?"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"(laughing)"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"- It's a good comedy car."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"I always thought it was funny because the Volkswagen,"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"they had the new Beetle."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"And then I felt like Chrysler,"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"I think Chrysler makes the PT Cruiser."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"They decided we're gonna take the 1920s"
01:04:10;01:04:14;"sort of Model T style and smooth it out for the '90s."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Am I way off on that?"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"- If you were an overweight family of five in Iowa"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"that was looking for something to drive to the buffet in,"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"I would say the PT Cruiser is for you."
01:04:25;01:04:29;"It is a very, it's a much maligned vehicle,"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"almost as maligned as the Prius,"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"which I think is unfairly maligned."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"It's a comedy vehicle for sure, like the PT Cruiser."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"If you're gonna use it in comedy,"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"I would say use the PT Cruiser."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"- We've talked on this show about how"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Grateful Dead t-shirts,"
01:04:43;01:04:48;"probably one of the most produced band shirts ever"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"because they played such big shows or whatever,"
01:04:50;01:04:54;"that suddenly the value for real vintage"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"Grateful Dead shirts skyrocketed"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"'cause of renewed interest in the band."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"And I'm sure you had all sorts of people being like,"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"""Oh my God, I had this smelly old shirt."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"You're telling me now I can sell that for $350."""
01:05:04;01:05:06;"I threw that out because at the time,"
01:05:06;01:05:10;"as far as shirts went, this held negligible value."
01:05:10;01:05:15;"So with the PT Cruiser, you just can't see."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"There's no version where in 30 years,"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"somebody's like, ""You know, it's funny."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"Like back in the day, everybody was talking about,"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"you know, Porsches and Ferraris,"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"and they're all talking about European cars."""
01:05:26;01:05:29;"But actually the taste of the car community"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"has really come around."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"And a PT Cruiser, you know,"
01:05:32;01:05:37;"if you had bought 10 PT Cruisers in good shape in 2020,"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"right now you would be a billionaire."
01:05:38;01:05:42;"- There's no world where what you just said will ever happen."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"(both laughing)"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"I don't think anybody's ever floated that theory before"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"with PT Cruisers."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"No, it's the car, here are the cars."
01:05:51;01:05:55;"They're the cars where they only made 20 of them."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"- The first part of it, you do have right."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"That so many people in the past have had these cars"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"and have owned them for years and let them go."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"And then they suddenly just pop out of nowhere."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"Race cars from the '60s and '70s"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"are a really good example of that."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Because they were raced a lot,"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"they had different engines thrown in them."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Because they were raced a lot, they were crashed."
01:06:14;01:06:17;"So right up until as recently as the '90s,"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"there was no market for used race cars."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"And then, you know, people were like,"
01:06:21;01:06:26;"well, hey, that's Steve McQueen's race car from Le Mans."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And it's got a camera mount still on it."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"That's a pretty cool thing, maybe."
01:06:30;01:06:34;"And suddenly, people started buying these race cars"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"that had been passed around for next to nothing."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"And now they're worth, you know,"
01:06:38;01:06:42;"like that Steve McQueen 917 is a $30 million car."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"Whereas, you know, maybe in the '80s and '90s,"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"you might be getting that for nine or 10 grand, right?"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"- Right, oh my God."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"- So there's stuff, the market does change,"
01:06:52;01:06:55;"but it always tends to go towards"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"the low number rare vehicles."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"- Was there ever like a limited edition,"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"like Eddie Bauer edition PT Cruiser type thing"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"that had a low?"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"(laughing)"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- You're gonna keep going now."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- No, okay."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"We can try out the PT Cruiser thing."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"- Do you?"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"(laughing)"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"Did you corner the market in PT Cruisers?"
01:07:18;01:07:18;"Do you need me?"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"I'll change what I have to say."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"- I'm not gonna be collecting PT Cruisers."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"I really thought this conversation"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"was gonna go a different way."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"(laughing)"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"One actual question I have though,"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"I'm interested in like what holds value and stuff."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"So, and I know a lot of people are into Porsches"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"and you know, objectively it's a beautiful car."
01:07:35;01:07:39;"And yeah, when I've hung out with my friend as a 1969 911,"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"and I'm like, I get it."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Like we're driving around,"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"and also like the conversations people strike up."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"I'm like, oh, this is kind of like a cool community."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Just like at Dunkin' Donuts,"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"there's always like somebody's like,"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"oh, what year is that?"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"And I'm like, oh, okay."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"This is like a secret society that you guys are a part of."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"But one question that I have is,"
01:07:55;01:07:58;"does the focus of the community still stay"
01:07:58;01:08:02;"pretty like zoomed in on like the 50s through the 70s?"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"Or is like now that we're 20 years out from the year 2000,"
01:08:06;01:08:10;"are they starting to be like, you know, a 2003 911?"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Like that's actually skyrocketing value."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"Or does everybody still kind of keep focusing"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"similar to, you know,"
01:08:16;01:08:20;"Rolling Stone just dropped their top 500 albums of all time."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"The highest percentage, what was the 70s?"
01:08:23;01:08:23;"Even though, you know,"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"now we're 50 years out from the 70s."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"There's, you know, like in music,"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"there's still is a disproportionately huge focus"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"on the 60s and 70s."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Is there a similar thing with the car community?"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"- Yeah, but getting back to the PT Cruiser."
01:08:37;01:08:37;"- Yes."
01:08:37;01:08:42;"- In 2006, they announced that they had made a million,"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"a million, think of this."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"There are a million PT Cruisers"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"out there in the world right now, all right?"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"Which means any one of us this evening"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"can probably go get one for a few hundred dollars"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"because there are a million of them out there."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"- What about if you could get one in truly mint condition?"
01:08:58;01:08:58;"That this has zero miles on it?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"- Yeah, but it doesn't matter."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"- That wouldn't matter to a collector?"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"That wouldn't matter to you?"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"If I told you right now, I had a PT 98."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"It had zero miles on it."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"- Yeah, but you're talking about a premium of what?"
01:09:10;01:09:11;"Maybe 10% above what they're worth?"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"So yeah, okay."
01:09:12;01:09:15;"Instead of 700, I'm gonna give you 1200 for it."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"It just doesn't have value 'cause there's no market for it."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"But getting back to your question,"
01:09:19;01:09:23;"after that, there are a couple of things that I've noticed."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"These are just my observations."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"One, when you were in high school,"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"the car that you may have had on your wall"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"or the wallpaper on your computer"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"is generally the one that later on,"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"when you're successful in your 30s and you have money,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"that's the car you buy."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"So right now, it was 60s and 70s cars,"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"but I'm noticing lots of 80s cars and 90s cars"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"are doing really well in the market"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"because that group of guys and girls"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"are now have a little money to spend."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Maybe they're settled in their family"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"and they want something cool."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"And it's the thing they looked at"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"when they were 12 on the road that they go,"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"""Oh, now I wanna have that."""
01:10:00;01:10:04;"And then there's, you see these old Bentleys and things,"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"the Rolls Royces that, I don't know,"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"they never really appealed to me,"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"but I find as I'm getting older,"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"I really liked brand new cars."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"And then suddenly I was looking at the 80s"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"and then suddenly the 70s and the 60s."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"And now I'm really interested in the 50s."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"I keep suddenly going back."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"- Ah, you go further and further."
01:10:22;01:10:26;"- Yeah, and smaller and smaller and more mechanical."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"No computers, no power, anything."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"I really like that experience"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"more than anything else right now."
01:10:31;01:10:35;"So that also I've noticed happens with friends of mine."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- Is there a thing like with watches"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"where people wanna get something"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"from the year they were born?"
01:10:40;01:10:44;"- Yes, that's very big in the car world and the watch world."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"It doesn't work."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"It doesn't do anything."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"It will not enhance your enjoyment."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"It's a trap that we get at."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"We think I've done it."
01:10:52;01:10:56;"And I have a car right now that is 82"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"that I didn't buy because it's the year"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"I graduated high school."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"But when it was offered to me, I went,"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"""Oh, absolutely, I've gotta get it for that reason."""
01:11:05;01:11:09;"It does not figure into my driving pleasure in any way."
01:11:09;01:11:13;"It's the car, the preservation example,"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"the way it drives is all that matters."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"It's a very funny little trap"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"and it's a very funny question."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"It does not work."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"Here's what does work in the watch community."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"I just find like with people,"
01:11:24;01:11:28;"like buying something to commemorate a moment in your life"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"or giving a gift to someone you care about"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"in a big moment in their life."
01:11:32;01:11:37;"That I find enriches the ownership experience, right?"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Your son's graduating high school"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"and you give him something he can appreciate."
01:11:41;01:11:44;"He will remember that when he looks at that watch."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"- You mean give him a watch from the year he was born"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"or just give him a watch for a new watch or whatever,"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"just that it commemorates that moment."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"- My personal experience with my watch collection"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"is the stuff in my collection,"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"I can look at it and tell you exactly what was going on"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"and why I have that watch."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"It was never just like, ""Oh, I want a shiny thing."""
01:12:03;01:12:07;"It was like, ""Here's the first year of Seinfeld"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"and I wanna kind of commemorate not getting fired."""
01:12:10;01:12:14;"So I bought that Tag Heuer watch, right?"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"And I remember it when I wear it."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"I'm like, ""Oh, I know what that watch means."""
01:12:18;01:12:22;"That's a good thing to do."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"- It seems like cars and watches,"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"there's like a huge overlap in terms of interest."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Like I can imagine for a variety of reasons,"
01:12:28;01:12:32;"you can get into the technical side if you wanted to,"
01:12:32;01:12:35;"the mechanics, just like the kind of design element,"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"the history, it makes sense that people"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"would be interested in both of them."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"Do you find that it's like almost everybody"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"who's into one is into the other?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"Or do you ever like find like,"
01:12:45;01:12:49;"""I'm a watch guy and I look down on car guys,"""
01:12:49;01:12:50;"or vice versa?"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"- That's hilarious."
01:12:51;01:12:52;"No, watch guys and car guys,"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"they're very closely related in their stupidity"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"and their addiction to these things."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"Very closely related."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Once somebody told me that they were like,"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"that they were like a classic path for a guy"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"gets into cars and then gets into watches"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"and then finally gets into guns."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"And I was like, ""Whoa, really?"""
01:13:13;01:13:15;"And he's like, ""Yeah, but you know,"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"""like not in like some creepy way."""
01:13:17;01:13:19;"They're just like in that sense of being interested"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"in the mechanics of objects and the history"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"and the collectible nature."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"Is that true?"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"- No, I don't see that."
01:13:26;01:13:26;"- No."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"- I see cars, there's kind of an Esquire,"
01:13:31;01:13:35;"kind of a European James Bondy gentleman"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"kind of aspect to it."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"I'll tell you what, cigars, I would put in that category."
01:13:40;01:13:46;"Bourbons, specific alcohols,"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"they're all kind of in that world."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"- And maybe guitars, if you like music."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"- Oh, definitely."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"I mean, I try and I,"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"and I've just broken my own rule,"
01:13:54;01:13:57;"but I try to avoid guitars and motorcycles"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"'cause I'll go down a similar road"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"and suddenly I'll end up having 10 guitars."
01:14:01;01:14:04;"Now I'm saying that to you as I now have five guitars"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"in my house all of a sudden"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"'cause my 10 year old just started taking lessons"
01:14:07;01:14:10;"and that started me up playing again."
01:14:10;01:14:11;"And then I called up Taylor and I said,"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"""Hey, send me one of those 717E builder editions."""
01:14:15;01:14:17;"Acoustics, I want a real acoustic guitar."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"'Cause I've been playing my same guitar,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"I've been playing since I was 12 years old,"
01:14:21;01:14:26;"which was a Lark that I think my parents paid $28 for."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"So I went from that old guitar to this one."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"I'm like, ""Oh my God, this is great."""
01:14:30;01:14:31;"And they go, ""You know what?"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"""Let's go get the Telecasters"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"""and the Stratocasters out of storage."""
01:14:34;01:14:38;"And so now every room's just got guitars and stands on it."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"And I've lost my mind."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"I have to stop myself from asking you,"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"""What's next?"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"""What do I get next?"""
01:14:44;01:14:45;"- Art."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"- What is it?"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"- Oh, art."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"- No, I mean, what kind of guitar?"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"- No, do you collect?"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"No, I mean, like what's next is collecting art."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"- Yeah, no, that's it."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"No, and also clearly I have a contrarian streak."
01:14:57;01:15:01;"I like PT Cruisers and for guitars,"
01:15:01;01:15:04;"probably like the guitar, I own very few guitars."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"I mean, you know, like I played an Epiphone Sheridan"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"on stage a lot, I like Strats,"
01:15:08;01:15:13;"but I really love Silvertones and that was a cheap guitar."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"But I really think that the Silvertones made by Sears,"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"Silvertone amps, Silvertone guitars from the late '60s."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"I like how they look and I like how they sound,"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"but yeah, but guitars are,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"yeah, it is kind of different than cars."
01:15:26;01:15:27;"The experience of playing a guitar,"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"it can be so idiosyncratic versus like driving a car"
01:15:31;01:15:34;"where your life is in the hands of the machine."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"You want something that's like really technically well-built."
01:15:37;01:15:37;"Sometimes with the guitar,"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"you want something (beep) up and weird sounding."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I don't know if that's true with cars."
01:15:41;01:15:44;"- This is exactly, your guitars are exactly the same."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"It's what I call crow behavior."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"You know how the crow sees the shiny thing"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"and every day it brings the shiny thing back to the nest?"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"- Right."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"- That's what collecting is, really."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"You know, you get the thing, you enjoy it,"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"the novelty wears off and you're like,"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"where's the next one?"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"And you know, I could do that with guitars,"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"I could do it with motorcycles, I've done it with cars."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Watches is way out of control for people."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"You should see what people are doing with watches."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"They're just acquiring and you know, you really have to,"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"and this is really where Spikes Car Radio is at its best."
01:16:16;01:16:20;"It's discussing this thing we do"
01:16:20;01:16:21;"and the ups and downs of it"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"and the traps and everything else."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"That's what we really, you know, when Jerry comes on"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"and I'm with Paul, my co-host,"
01:16:27;01:16:32;"we like to talk about situations like the lose-win,"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"when you're overheated about a car"
01:16:34;01:16:38;"and you don't win the bid and the relief you feel"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"and the loss you feel at the same time."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Like, oh (beep) I lost that thing I really wanted,"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"but it's a win because I didn't spend the money."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"And then three days later, you're like,"
01:16:47;01:16:50;"why was I even thinking about that, right?"
01:16:50;01:16:51;"Or we have this thing called Carnesia,"
01:16:51;01:16:56;"where you get into a car you haven't driven for six months"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"and you're like, oh my God, this thing is great."
01:16:58;01:17:01;"Why have I not been driving this, right?"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"That's, you know, the fun of collecting"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"is the psychology and the weirdness of it."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"And I think guitars are exactly the same."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"Everything you just said about your guitars"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"and the reasons why you love them"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"is exactly what I've heard with people talking"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"about their cars, whatever they might be."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"- Spike, I don't want to interrupt the flow here,"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"but can I ask a question that's off topic a little bit?"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"- Sure, as long as it's about Jeffrey Toobin."
01:17:23;01:17:28;"- It's, unfortunately, I mean, unless he has a cameo"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"for the Bee Movie sequel,"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"I just wanted to know what's happening with the-"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"- That's funny."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"- What's happening with the Beequel?"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"- The Beequel?"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"Did you think there was a Beequel?"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"- Well, I know that Jerry tweeted, you know,"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"a bit of like a teasing thing a couple of years ago."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Should I do a Bee Movie 2?"
01:17:44;01:17:45;"And people got very excited"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"because the Bee Movie has taken on a new cultural significance."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"- Could you tell me what that is?"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"Because we're just not understanding it."
01:17:54;01:17:57;"- I think it's reached a new generation."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Maybe there's some nostalgia built in."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"It's been filtered through the prism of the internet."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"I just want to know,"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"has there ever been any earnest conversation"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"about actually following up that film?"
01:18:07;01:18:12;"- There has, but it's mostly been fun and joking around."
01:18:12;01:18:15;"So in 2016, I think is the year you're talking about."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"And if I'm wrong, forgive me,"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"but in 2016, I believe for some reason,"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"Bee Movie, which came out in 2006,"
01:18:22;01:18:26;"in 2016, Bee Movie was the biggest movie on social media."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"And it was because kids and teenagers"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"were putting the entire script on their social media,"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"on t-shirts, and, you know,"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"we're just sitting here watching this thing going,"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"are they making fun of us?"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Or do they love it?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"We still don't understand what it was"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"and why it was happening."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"But I said to Jerry, I go,"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"look, let's just have some fun with it."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"And he go, are we going to do one?"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"He goes, no, we're not going to do one."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"We already did it."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"We did one."
01:18:51;01:18:52;"He goes, I don't want to go through that again."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"And I said, all right, here's what I want you to do."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"I'm going to have a Bee Movie 2 script printed up."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"Just something that says, Bee Movie 2,"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"do not distribute some stuff on it."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"I just want to arrange for you"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"to come out of your apartment building"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"and I'll have a paparazzi there."
01:19:05;01:19:09;"And just kind of incidentally shoot the script in your head."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"- Oh my God."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- So it'll be small, but people will be able to see it."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"And they go, jeez, this is Bee Movie 2."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"They are doing it."
01:19:15;01:19:18;"We've talked about lots of like pranky things like that,"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"very seriously, as recently as yesterday,"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"as I was doing an interview"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"with a Yahoo Entertainment reporter two days ago."
01:19:25;01:19:28;"And he said this exact, asked the same exact question."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"Do you ever talk to the Bee Movie writers"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"about doing something?"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"And we did talk about briefly."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"And again, this is just like you and us talking right here."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"We did get together and just chat about the idea"
01:19:38;01:19:42;"of some sort of eight episode arc on a Netflix"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"or something like that, where we just, you know,"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"had a lot more fun with some of the ideas"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"that we generated that we didn't do."
01:19:49;01:19:54;"But again, it was just talk, just fun, right?"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"It's, we were not, and I don't believe,"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"are seriously pursuing it."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"(laughs)"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"- The fact that it comes up so often, you know."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"- Here's the reason we want to do it."
01:20:03;01:20:06;"So we can write Jeff Bezos."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"(laughs)"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"We were dying to have a character, Jeff Bezos."
01:20:11;01:20:15;"So if that continues to entertain us, maybe,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"but I don't know, is DreamWorks Animation"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"still even in business?"
01:20:18;01:20:19;"Nobody even knows who owns it."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"We don't even know how to even approach anything like this."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"- Go straight to Amazon."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- That's right."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"- Who owns the rights to Bee Movie?"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"- Oh, who knows the rights to Bee?"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"- Who owns them?"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"Is that company, is DreamWorks Animation still in business?"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"It's a mess."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"- All right, we'll do some research and get,"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"we'll try to make this happen, why not?"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"Come back to me with your thoughts and we'll talk."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"- Well, thanks so much, Spike."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"We hope you'll come back again."
01:20:44;01:20:47;"We covered a lot of ground and I don't know,"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"it sounds like for your podcast,"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"you probably wouldn't do a PT Cruiser episode,"
01:20:51;01:20:54;"but if you, I don't know if you're already into it,"
01:20:54;01:20:58;"but if you do, we'd be happy and we'll come,"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"well, we'll really research and we'll come correct."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"- You come, yeah, that would be good."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"No, I would be happy to do that."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"Our show is mostly the intersection"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"of entertainment and cars."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"And then sometimes it's just comedians coming on"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"and promoting their specials."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"So, and we're out there every Wednesday with a new show."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"We had Jerry on last week and this fella"
01:21:19;01:21:23;"who's got a new book, ""A Man and His Cars"" on today's show."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"But we've had like Jason Bateman, Matt Damon come on,"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"lots of big stars and then lots of folks you don't know"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"who we just think are great, so."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Well, everybody check it out."
01:21:32;01:21:36;"And even though the Esquire network's been canceled,"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"check out the pre-seasons of ""Car Matchmaker,"""
01:21:39;01:21:41;"which you can still stream."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"- Yeah, it's still there."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"- Great talking to you, Spike."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Thanks so much for coming on."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"- Very nice to meet you guys."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"- Yeah, nice to meet you too."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Have a good one."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"- All right, take care now."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"- Let's get into the top five."
01:21:52;01:21:57;"- It's time for the top five, five on iTunes."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"- This week on the top five,"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"we're gonna be comparing the top five songs"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"on Apple Music right now with the top five"
01:22:06;01:22:09;"Billboard hits of 1995."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Why 1995, Jake?"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"- I was hoping Seinfeld could jump in here."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"- Oh yeah, Seinfeld, maybe this one's better for you."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"- Wasn't this the year that the Soup Nazi episode"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"of Seinfeld debuted?"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"- Yes, and actually very close to,"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"it's almost exactly 25 years ago."
01:22:23;01:22:26;"That was November 2nd, 1995."
01:22:26;01:22:30;"- You know what's also wild is I graduated high school in '95."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"- Were you like a big Seinfeld head at that era, Jake?"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"- I wouldn't say I was a head."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"I was definitely a fan,"
01:22:36;01:22:39;"but I still have not seen every episode."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"- What the (beep)"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"- Is there gonna be a problem?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- No, I mean, it's cool."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"- Is there gonna be a problem?"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"- No, I mean, it's all on DVD."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"It's coming to Netflix next year."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"- Seinfeld just cannot control himself."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"(laughing)"
01:22:53;01:22:57;"- I would watch Seinfeld episodes on rerun"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"after Yankees games, WPIX at like 11."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"- Yes."
01:23:02;01:23:05;"- I wouldn't watch when they were airing Thursdays at eight"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"or whatever, you know, whatever."
01:23:06;01:23:10;"- I saw most of them in the late night ones."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"- You know, I almost envy you"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"because you still have, you know, unseen episodes."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"I wish I was in that position."

01:29:48;01:29:51;"- Right, 'cause Regeneron is one of the best treatments,"

01:29:53;01:29:55;"it's never gonna be available to most people"

01:30:16;01:30:18;"- The ultimate status symbol."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"- He actually has, it's actually a third fridge."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"- I got a third fridge full of Regeneron."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- I got a chest freezer full of Regeneron."

01:30:41;01:30:44;"The Regeneron Corporation."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"- Yeah, it's just like a movie made in like 1989."

01:31:11;01:31:14;"just to be like, yeah, 30 years, sure."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"But I don't know if maybe a lot of people do,"
01:31:18;01:31:21;"but 21 Savage seems to talk about Ms a lot."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"'Cause you know, he had a big song,"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"great song called Bank Account."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"It was like a really big hit a few years ago"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"where he went, I got one, two, three, four,"
01:31:28;01:31:32;"five, six, seven, eight Ms in my bank account."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"And then he goes, I got one, two, three, four,"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"five, six, seven, eight shooters ready to gun you down."
01:31:36;01:31:40;"Do we ever try to do like a rap song"
01:31:40;01:31:43;"that was about listing how many fridges you have?"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"(laughing)"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Maybe that's a better idea to throw out there"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"and not even try to do it, but it's like,"
01:31:48;01:31:52;"I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight fridges"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"in my garage."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Fridges in my residence."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"In my residence."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"I got fridges in my residence."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"That could be like a great verse,"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"it's like breaking down what you use every fridge for."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"- Oh yeah."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"And then it's like eight fridge household."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"Eight fridge household."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"- That kind of weirdly reminds me of,"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"there's a Jay-Z lyric."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"What is it?"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it?"

01:32:18;01:32:19;"Do you remember that one?"
01:32:19;01:32:23;"- I mean, he needs the storage."
01:32:23;01:32:26;"- It's just bizarre."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"- Well, and also maybe I'm picturing like late period Jay-Z"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"where like the fact that he's like an art collector"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"with everybody knows and he talked about it,"
01:32:34;01:32:39;"but I'm like the idea of like a condo filled with condoms,"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"it's like in the early nineties"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"at the height of the AIDS epidemic,"
01:32:43;01:32:47;"the Whitney Museum had an artist in residence program"
01:32:47;01:32:52;"and a conceptual artist, whoever, like take your pick."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"- Felix Gonzalez Torres."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"- Is that a real person?"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"- Yes."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"- Does that kind of stuff?"
01:32:57;01:33:00;"It's like in Felix Gonzalez Torres actually purchased"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"a condo which the Whitney still maintains."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"It's on the Upper East Side."
01:33:04;01:33:07;"It's at Lexington between a 78th and 79th."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"You could still visit."
01:33:08;01:33:11;"You have to make an email appointment."
01:33:11;01:33:12;"You can't just show up,"
01:33:12;01:33:15;"but they have a few visitors a day"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"and the condo is full of condoms."

01:48:29;01:48:31;"It wouldn't be unreasonable that somebody listening"

01:48:35;01:48:38;"I know him, I worked with him in some capacity."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"He's a totally easygoing guy."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"He would totally be down with the tone of the show."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"If anybody's listening and has that relationship with him,"
01:48:45;01:48:49;"then maybe you can hit us up or just reach out yourself"

01:48:50;01:48:52;"They were kind of sheepish on the show."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"They felt shy about it."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"If it came via publicist, it might seem kind of bizarre."

01:48:59;01:49:01;"Like, you'll feel right at home."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"They're actually fans."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"I don't know."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"- The small impression that I have of him"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"is that he would obviously,"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"he's low-key down-to-earth guy"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"with a good sense of humor that would totally get the show."
01:49:11;01:49:14;"But going through publicist seems hilarious."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"- I'm sure there's somebody listening"
01:49:15;01:49:19;"who's at least one degree of separation from Doug Marsh."

01:50:33;01:50:35;"I think we talked about ""Never Got to the Bottom of It."""
01:50:35;01:50:37;"I think ""Tears in Heaven,"""

01:50:38;01:50:41;"that's written about the tragic death of his son,"

01:50:44;01:50:46;"- I'm gonna do my own number crunch on this one."
01:50:46;01:50:50;"- I think of that as a MTV Unplugged hit."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"- No, originally it was on the soundtrack"
01:50:52;01:50:55;"for a movie called ""Rush"" from 1992."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Like, do you guys know the 1992 movie ""Rush""?"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"- Yeah, Jason Patrick and-"
01:50:59;01:51:00;"- Jennifer Jason Leigh."
01:51:00;01:51:04;"- Yeah, they play like undercover DEA agents"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"that get hooked on heroin or some (beep)"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"- Yep."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Oh, it's a period piece in the '70s."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"So I always kind of wondered, like, not judging,"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"but I'm just like, the song ""Tears in Heaven"""
01:51:14;01:51:19;"is about like truly, probably one of the most brutal things"
01:51:20;01:51:21;"a human being could go through."
01:51:21;01:51:25;"Just like absolutely terrible, heartbreaking story."
01:51:25;01:51:28;"And I've just always been, maybe it says on Wikipedia,"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"I've always been curious about like,"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"oh, I guess maybe he was assigned to write music"
01:51:32;01:51:36;"for this movie and his son had just died."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"- Assigned?"
01:51:37;01:51:40;"- Yeah, maybe he already like said he would."
01:51:40;01:51:44;"- Just like, what are the most famous rock stars ever?"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"Like, oh dude, you have to write a song"
01:51:46;01:51:49;"for this random ass like movie."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"- Wait, I guess maybe he scored the movie too."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"Okay, all right, so this makes sense."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"So basically this is what it says."
01:51:56;01:51:59;"So even before his son died in 1990,"
01:51:59;01:52:02;"two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician,"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"Stevie Ray Vaughan, SRV,"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"were killed in a helicopter accident."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"And then less than a year later,"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"his four year old son, Connor, died,"
01:52:10;01:52:11;"falling out of a window, tragic story."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"- Jesus."
01:52:12;01:52:15;"- Yeah, like (beep) how heavy does it get?"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Like terrible."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"So he was in a real (beep) up period."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"He was isolated."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"And I guess he had already been,"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"he was supposed to score this movie."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"And he said of the song,"
01:52:24;01:52:25;"""It was in the back of my head,"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"but it didn't really have a reason for being"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"until I was scoring this movie."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Then it sort of had a reason to be."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"It is a little ambiguous because it could be taken"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"to be about Connor,"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"but it is also meant to be part of the film."""
01:52:36;01:52:38;"So maybe he was in this weird (beep) up place"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"and he was like, just wanted to get back to work"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"and he starts writing a song."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"And he's of course like thinking about death"
01:52:45;01:52:46;"and he's trying to make it about the movie,"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"but it also makes him think of his son."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"All right, so that makes sense."
01:52:49;01:52:53;"It is like a strange place it ended up, but."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"- I only know the MTV unplugged version."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"I guess there's probably a studio version"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"that was originally on that soundtrack,"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"which I've never heard."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"- Never heard?"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"- I think I've only heard like that song on the radio."
01:53:07;01:53:11;"'Cause it's been on the radio constantly for decades."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"And I feel like the definitive version"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"is that unplugged version."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"- Well, throw this on."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"I think it's not that different."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"- It's still acoustic."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"- Yeah."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- Is this the studio version?"

01:55:58;01:55:59;"- Yeah."

01:56:00;01:56:02;"- It's never a forced reference."

01:56:11;01:56:12;"- Yeah, it all makes sense."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"- At this Mexican restaurant eating the wet ass burrito."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"- You know how Ezra always talks about like the perfect"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"sort of narrative and never sort of forcing it?"

01:56:23;01:56:24;"- Just putting it together."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"Well done, Patrick World."
01:56:26;01:56:31;"The number one song this week in 1995,"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"I guess, you know, I'm realizing something."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"It's like, I guess this is obvious,"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"we've talked about it before, but it's like,"
01:56:36;01:56:41;"when we do mid to late 90s top fives, I know it so well."
01:56:41;01:56:44;"I know it even better than like when I was like college age"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"later, I don't know it quite as well,"
01:56:46;01:56:50;"but these songs, like there's something about being 11"
01:56:50;01:56:53;"where you just like, you absorb these songs."
01:56:53;01:56:55;"So they all like strike a chord in me."
01:56:55;01:56:58;"And number one, this is just a total classic,"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Mariah Carey fantasy."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"It's built on a Tom Tom Club sample."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"Love this."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"- Hell yeah."
01:57:05;01:57:07;"- I feel like Jake, when we first met"
01:57:07;01:57:08;"on tour with Dirty Projectors,"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"I had like a big brick iPod"
01:57:10;01:57:13;"and I remember this song was on it."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"I feel like we listened to this a lot."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"- I remember, yeah."
01:57:16;01:57:19;"This, you know, '95 is a funny days between"
01:57:19;01:57:22;"'cause you were 11, I was 18."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"- That's a weird days between moment."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"- That's a funny hang."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"I mean, yeah, I was a freshman in college."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"- Yeah."
01:57:30;01:57:53;"- Incredible."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"- Such a feel good song."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"- Yep."
01:58:37;01:58:40;"- So it's not the remix with ODB."
01:58:40;01:58:41;"- Straight up original."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"- That was also such a classic verse."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"It was still kind of novel at the time"
01:58:45;01:58:48;"to have like Mariah Carey, this kind of like,"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"at the time her image was still pretty like prim,"
01:58:50;01:58:54;"you know, like, and then ODB,"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"obviously his name is old dirty bastard."
01:58:56;01:58:58;"Just like bad boy, just come up,"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"me and Mariah, go back like babies,"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"just pass apart, it's incredible."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"- I remember even like when she put out Heartbreaker,"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"which was like, I don't know, late nineties or something."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"And Jay-Z was on that."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"- Yeah."
01:59:11;01:59:15;"- And I was like, oh cool, like that's an interesting combo."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"- And he had a great verse on that."
01:59:16;01:59:19;"It was like the perfect verse for like everybody."
01:59:19;01:59:23;"You could be like a 10 year old, you know, kid,"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"just like rapping along every word."
01:59:25;01:59:28;"All right, shout out to Mariah Carey."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"You're an absolute legend, mate."
01:59:30;01:59:34;"The number one song right now on Apple Music,"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"Pop Smoke, Rest in Peace, Four of the Night,"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"featuring Lil Baby and Da Baby."
01:59:38;01:59:41;"This is the song with both babies."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"[upbeat music]"
01:59:43;02:00:06;"Oh yeah, I'm a thief in the night."
02:00:07;02:00:10;"I did some wrong, but I'm always right."
02:00:10;02:00:14;"Said I know how to shoot, and I know how to fight."
02:00:14;02:00:18;"If I tell you once, I'ma tell you twice."
02:00:18;02:00:22;"I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night."
02:00:22;02:00:26;"If I call you babe, you'll be babe for the day,"
02:00:26;02:00:28;"or a babe for the night."
02:00:28;02:00:31;"You're not my wife, she want a killer."
02:00:31;02:00:35;"So f*** online, I want a f*** on the t-shirt."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"Give me a f*** online."
02:00:37;02:00:42;"AP, Big Rocks, in the hood with the realest."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"5K on the dinner."
02:00:43;02:00:45;"- 5K on the dinner."
02:00:45;02:00:47;"- Damn. - I wonder where they went."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"- In LA?"
02:00:48;02:00:51;"- I'm gonna assume so."
02:00:51;02:00:54;"- Is there a place you could drop 5K on dinner"
02:00:54;02:00:55;"for two people in LA?"
02:00:55;02:00:59;"- I think the thing with really expensive dinners"
02:00:59;02:01:02;"is it's always the alcohol that puts it over the top."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"- You get like a thousand dollar bottle of wine"
02:01:04;02:01:05;"or something?"
02:01:05;02:01:06;"- I mean, it could be,"
02:01:06;02:01:09;"you could get probably a $4,000 bottle of wine."
02:01:09;02:01:09;"- Right."
02:01:09;02:01:12;"- Jake, what's the most you ever spent on a bottle of wine?"
02:01:12;02:01:13;"- I don't know, man."
02:01:13;02:01:14;"Not a lot."
02:01:14;02:01:18;"I mean, 20 or 30 or..."
02:01:18;02:01:20;"We went to like some like nicer event"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"and we bought like a $40 bottle of wine."
02:01:22;02:01:25;"You end up just like putting on the like kitchen counter"
02:01:25;02:01:29;"and it just ends up sitting there being unopened."
02:01:29;02:01:30;"- Right."
02:01:30;02:01:30;"- That kind of vibe."
02:01:30;02:01:34;"But like, I don't like just like buy like a $50 bottle"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"of wine to like drink by myself."
02:01:36;02:01:37;"- Oh, we should have talked about that with Spike."
02:01:37;02:01:38;"That's another thing."
02:01:38;02:01:39;"- Maybe I should."
02:01:39;02:01:41;"- He's getting into wine."
02:01:41;02:01:43;"- Yeah, he shut down the art vibe pretty hard,"
02:01:43;02:01:47;"but he definitely seemed in on like expensive booze."
02:01:47;02:01:48;"- There's something about that"
02:01:48;02:01:49;"that's like a type of like dude."
02:01:49;02:01:53;"You know, like there's a magazine called Guitar Aficionado."
02:01:53;02:01:56;"I always heard about it from Dave Maklovich from Chromio."
02:01:56;02:01:59;"He was always like obsessed with that magazine he's saying."
02:01:59;02:02:01;"'Cause their thing is that they,"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"their worldview or like what they describe,"
02:02:03;02:02:06;"what they write about is called the deluxe life."
02:02:06;02:02:11;"I think it basically is like whiskey, guitars and cars."
02:02:11;02:02:13;"And I'm sure watches a little bit."
02:02:13;02:02:14;"- Motorcycle."
02:02:14;02:02:15;"- Yeah."
02:02:15;02:02:17;"- Maybe motorcycles, deluxe life."
02:02:17;02:02:19;"So like he kind of uses deluxe life as a shorthand"
02:02:19;02:02:22;"sometimes to describe like that universe."
02:02:22;02:02:24;"And maybe art is not totally,"
02:02:24;02:02:28;"I can imagine some art is deluxe life, but not all of it."
02:02:28;02:02:29;"- Art is too like prissy."
02:02:29;02:02:30;"- I guess it depends."
02:02:30;02:02:33;"Like what's the, that Western guy who makes,"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"made like the sculptures of cowboys"
02:02:35;02:02:38;"that George W. Bush had in the Oval Office."
02:02:38;02:02:39;"- I don't know, man."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"- Remember like every president"
02:02:40;02:02:43;"like brings one thing to the Oval Office."
02:02:43;02:02:43;"- Oh yeah, no."
02:02:43;02:02:46;"Like I feel like every president redecorates"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"the entire White House with art"
02:02:48;02:02:51;"from the National Gallery's collection."
02:02:51;02:02:56;"So like Carol Walker and like more contemporary artists,"
02:02:56;02:03:00;"a lot of African-American artists."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"- I'm sure Trump was like full kitsch."
02:03:02;02:03:05;"Maybe Trump, you know what this is like?"
02:03:05;02:03:08;"If Trump had like Jeff Koons everywhere in the White House,"
02:03:08;02:03:09;"that would be amazing."
02:03:09;02:03:11;"I'm sure he doesn't, but that would be perfect."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"- Okay, so the thing that George W. Bush had"
02:03:13;02:03:17;"in the Oval Office was a Frederick Remington."
02:03:17;02:03:19;"He's a famous."
02:03:19;02:03:23;"- He's like a 19th century artist."
02:03:23;02:03:24;"He's a painter, yeah."
02:03:24;02:03:25;"Yeah, great painter."
02:03:25;02:03:27;"- His sculptures are pretty interesting."
02:03:27;02:03:27;"They're well-made."
02:03:27;02:03:29;"Like this one's called the rattlesnake."
02:03:29;02:03:33;"And another famous one called the bronco buster."
02:03:33;02:03:35;"You know, it's like these dramatic like cowboys"
02:03:35;02:03:38;"and the horses like rearing up."
02:03:38;02:03:40;"Anyway, they can kind of be deluxe."
02:03:40;02:03:41;"Yeah, but I don't know."
02:03:41;02:03:42;"It is like a funny thing."
02:03:42;02:03:45;"Just like, oh yeah, I just paid $800,000."
02:03:45;02:03:48;"I don't even know, millions for a Frederick Remington?"
02:03:48;02:03:49;"No idea."
02:03:49;02:03:50;"- That's a good question."
02:03:50;02:03:51;"(laughing)"
02:03:51;02:03:52;"I don't know."
02:03:52;02:03:54;"It's a secondary market."
02:03:54;02:03:57;"- The lowest price you can pay for a Remington is $75,000."
02:03:57;02:03:58;"- Oh really?"
02:03:58;02:04:01;"For a painting or for an etching?"
02:04:01;02:04:03;"- For a bronze sculpture."
02:04:03;02:04:05;"- Cheaper than a Ferrari."
02:04:05;02:04:05;"- That's a good question."
02:04:05;02:04:06;"How big?"
02:04:06;02:04:09;"Seems like they're kind of small."
02:04:09;02:04:10;"- Yeah."
02:04:10;02:04:11;"- And that's the lowest price."
02:04:11;02:04:13;"That's the bottom end."
02:04:13;02:04:16;"- You know, I think if this is so deep"
02:04:16;02:04:17;"that we're in the end of the episode,"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"we're talking about Frederick Remington."
02:04:19;02:04:21;"He's definitely known more as a painter."
02:04:21;02:04:22;"- Okay."
02:04:22;02:04:24;"- And he's an incredible painter."
02:04:24;02:04:26;"But it's real cowboys and Indians."
02:04:26;02:04:30;"It's definitely the myth of like Manifest Destiny."
02:04:30;02:04:31;"- Right."
02:04:31;02:04:33;"- And like cowboys shooting guns at Indians."
02:04:33;02:04:34;"- The noble."
02:04:34;02:04:38;"- I mean he nails the dust and the sunlight and the heat."
02:04:38;02:04:41;"But it's weird to see."
02:04:41;02:04:42;"And it's like a John Wayne movie."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"- I see."
02:04:43;02:04:45;"Problematic."
02:04:45;02:04:49;"Well, on that note, Frederick Remington, you're canceled."
02:04:49;02:04:50;"This is the--"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"(laughing)"
02:04:52;02:04:56;"This is the end of time crisis."
02:04:56;02:04:58;"Thank you to our guests, Uncle Ted and Spike."
02:04:58;02:05:03;"Parents, then we'll see you in two weeks."
02:05:03;02:05:07;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
