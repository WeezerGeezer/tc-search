00:04;00:07;"We dig into the mailbag"
00:07;00:12;"We talk about the top hits of 1978 and today all that"
00:12;00:17;"Plus one more trip to the Butterfinger Fountain. That's right"
00:17;00:20;"This is a very special"
00:20;00:25;"crispity crunchity peanut buttery edition of"
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King"
00:30;00:32;"BBB Peace"
00:32;00:34;"One"
00:35;00:37;"They passed me by"
00:37;00:39;"All of those great romances"
00:39;00:43;"Do what I felt were beneath"
00:43;00:46;"All my rightful chances"
00:46;00:50;"My picture clear"
00:50;00:53;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:53;00:58;"And so I dealt to the floor"
00:58;01:01;"When the bus had to go"
01:02;01:05;"Now it's different. I want you to know"
01:05;01:24;"Time crisis back again. What's up, jake? Not much. How you doing feeling good? You know one thing I realized"
01:24;01:28;"We probably should talk about in the last episode is that we actually went and saw goose"
01:28;01:31;"Yep, which because we first heard about goose on the show"
01:32;01:39;"Mm-hmm. We probably should at least report on a little bit. Yeah, I thought about that too. I was like, oh we missed the goose recap"
01:39;01:40;"Yeah, yeah"
01:40;01:42;"so for anybody who uh"
01:42;01:49;"Doesn't remember maybe a new listener. This is their first their first episode of time crisis a few episodes back"
01:49;01:52;"a friend of the show steven heiden"
01:52;01:58;"Rock critic and podcaster his bio on twitter is the wing of american rock critics"
01:59;02:05;"Okay. So yeah, so you first and foremost identifies as rock critic. Yeah, the wean of rock critics american rock critics"
02:05;02:07;"He had jacob about a new jam band"
02:07;02:13;"Called goose and he thought jake might be interested because they're straight out of norwalk, connecticut. Yeah, they have a great name"
02:13;02:18;"They're from connecticut and they're jam band. Yeah, and this show is very jam band friendly. We"
02:18;02:24;"Well, I think he became hip to this show because of our legendary twiddle episode and then this summer"
02:24;02:28;"Vampire weekend's touring with twiddle it all comes full circle. That's crazy"
02:29;02:33;"You got to come out for the mountain run man. Would love to so when we went and saw goose"
02:33;02:35;"Well, we didn't know this was at the troubadour"
02:35;02:41;"In west hollywood what we didn't know is that they were on tour opening for uh pigeons playing ping pong"
02:41;02:46;"So you had fans from both acts and probably a lot of shared fans there"
02:46;02:49;"But we thought we were just going to see a goose show and we're actually seeing them opening"
02:49;02:52;"But I think at this point they're both"
02:52;02:57;"Popping jam bands. They probably could have played the show solo either one of them. Oh sure"
02:57;02:59;"It was a real flock versus flock"
02:59;03:02;"Right situation. We we asked goose about this a little bit"
03:02;03:05;"So basically for people who have no idea what we're talking about"
03:05;03:09;"Goose is an up-and-coming jam band pigeons playing ping pong a little more established"
03:09;03:13;"Pigeons playing ping pong are from uh, I think the baltimore area, maryland"
03:13;03:16;"And being that they have pigeons in their name"
03:16;03:22;"Their fans are called the flock and I think when they were starting out goose's fans are also called the flock"
03:22;03:27;"So it's a bit of a makes a lot of sense. They both make sense. You can't fault either one of them"
03:27;03:29;"I mean, I don't think it's a plagiarism situation"
03:29;03:32;"But I think there might have been a bit of a standoff"
03:32;03:38;"About like who's going to change their fan base name and maybe it was the goose fans stood down relented"
03:38;03:40;"You can't have two flocks you could"
03:40;03:45;"Yeah, I guess why not? I guess if two flocks join they become one big flock. Yeah"
03:45;03:48;"I mean that night at the tribidor felt like one big flock and there weren't"
03:48;03:55;"Just rolling up on a random jam band fan in front of the tribidor which flock you with oh me i'm goose"
03:56;03:58;"anyway, this is uh"
03:58;04:03;"The second jam band show that we've been to together at the tribidor. The other was twiddle"
04:03;04:08;"And the first thing you notice when you see a jam band show at the tribidor is you suddenly don't feel like you're in"
04:08;04:15;"Southern california anymore infamously hostile jam band territory. You feel like maybe you're in boulder, colorado"
04:15;04:18;"eugene, oregon"
04:18;04:22;"Burlington vermont ashland, oregon ashland, oregon band oregon"
04:23;04:29;"Missoula, montana, norwalk, connecticut. Oh, yeah, new paltz, new york western, mass. Is that a yeah?"
04:29;04:35;"It's a little crunchy there. Yeah northampton, mass new hope pennsylvania. Oh, that's wean country"
04:35;04:39;"Yep, that's crunchy there ashville, north carolina big time"
04:39;04:47;"Anyway, you don't feel like you're in socal because you got this mix of people got the look got the clothes and it's great"
04:47;04:50;"It's like you're stepping through a portal to another a slightly crunchier place"
04:51;04:56;"There was that one dude in the front who was like posted up right in front of the stage that looked exactly like phil lesh"
04:56;05:00;"Oh, yeah, like 30 or 40 years younger. Yeah, we both clocked that"
05:00;05:04;"Just a straight up phil like who's that phil doppelganger?"
05:04;05:07;"Maybe phil lesh sometimes puts on young person makeup"
05:07;05:13;"And just goes to check out some of the younger jam bands. He's got to do three hours of uh,"
05:13;05:15;"prosthetic makeup"
05:15;05:16;"before he goes"
05:16;05:21;"Yeah to the show people always do these I feel like there's always these things where somebody"
05:21;05:26;"Like a skinny person like tyra banks. This is an infamous episode of her tv show"
05:26;05:31;"She wears a fat suit to feel what it's like to be a larger person"
05:31;05:35;"And there's definitely stuff where like a younger person puts on old person's makeup"
05:35;05:38;"Either to play pranks on people"
05:38;05:42;"Or just experience what it's like to be old. Nobody ever tries the opposite"
05:42;05:47;"I guess it'd be a tough one. Basically. It's an irishman. I'm not sure where this goes"
05:47;05:51;"But maybe it's like a reality show we get a bunch of old people and then we make them sit for three hours of young"
05:51;05:55;"Makeup, and then yeah, they'd just be moving slowly down the sidewalk"
05:55;05:59;"So anyway, goose was great live. We had a grand old time watching goose"
05:59;06:04;"It was a real like kind of organic feel good kind of laid back"
06:04;06:07;"feel because a lot of jam bands can go like"
06:07;06:11;"They're a little like hyped up and like souped up. Yeah kind of out of the gate"
06:12;06:16;"I thought they were kind of laying back in the cut in a nice way and really preferred their"
06:16;06:20;"live sound to the recorded sound which steven had uh,"
06:20;06:22;"Well, I think it might be the case"
06:22;06:26;"it's often the case with the jam bands and you know, we talked to the goose guys a little bit afterwards and"
06:26;06:33;"They're working on material now. So we probably haven't seen their honed studio sound"
06:33;06:36;"Yet. Yeah, but yeah, I mean I like the"
06:36;06:40;"Out the gate I think was maybe it was the opener was a time to flee"
06:41;06:47;"Which is in something maybe their most like dead kind of tune because it has that uh that slipknot type riff"
06:47;06:53;"Ups and downs"
06:53;06:56;"All I know"
06:56;06:58;"This elevator"
06:58;07:01;"Rises too slow"
07:01;07:04;"Trapped inside"
07:04;07:07;"With you"
07:07;07:09;"No way out"
07:10;07:12;"Deja vu"
07:12;07:17;"I don't feel free"
07:17;07:23;"It was time to flee"
07:23;07:26;"The elevator"
07:26;07:28;"I'm not a waiter"
07:28;07:31;"So see you later"
07:31;07:34;"Alligator"
07:34;07:37;"The elevator"
07:37;07:39;"I'm not a waiter"
07:39;07:42;"So see you later"
07:42;07:44;"Alligator"
07:44;07:45;"I said this at the show"
07:45;07:48;"But there's this moment where goose is going to this extended jam"
07:48;07:51;"And it seemed like they were kind of teasing something and I swear"
07:51;07:55;"It might have been just a goose mind meld it flickered through my brain"
07:55;08:00;"I was kind of like that almost reminds me of billy joel or something about this jam that sounded like billy joel to me"
08:00;08:05;"And then the next song they just kick into moving out anthony's song so sick"
08:05;08:07;"Which then they jammed out and had this like whole?"
08:07;08:18;"And that was like a pretty perfect tri-state area moment because you and goose are from connecticut"
08:18;08:26;"I grew up in jersey billy joel king of long island truly a tri-state moment out in weird ass west hollywood, california"
08:26;08:31;"Amazing, so it was a great show. We got to meet them chop it up a bit"
08:31;08:35;"And you know what caught a little bit of pigeons. They're rocking pretty hard. They did some chili peppers"
08:35;08:41;"I guess later period or maybe mid period they seem like more of a funk outfit"
08:41;08:45;"Yeah, they might have just been bringing the funk in the like part of the show that we saw right?"
08:45;08:47;"But I was like I was pretty down"
08:47;08:53;"But anyway all in all a great show shout out to goose close it out at dantana's with some calamari"
08:53;08:57;"Yep, some late night calamari saw um the guy from zz top there"
08:58;09:04;"Yep, classic dantana situation. It's a real rock and roll night that'd been tight if we're just like sitting there"
09:04;09:12;"Midnight at dantana's eating some calamari billy gibbons from zz top walks by just like hey billy. What's up fellas you like goose?"
09:12;09:16;"Uh, what's that? What's that man?"
09:16;09:20;"Goose, yeah, we're just next door checking him out, man. We got a lot of stuff to cover"
09:20;09:23;"Yeah, we do so"
09:23;09:28;"This might be a record for time crisis. This is our third episode in a row of talking about something"
09:28;09:32;"But uh eric j blessing"
09:32;09:35;"Tweeted at us. He thought we should know about this"
09:35;09:40;"It's no duncan, but I want to know if jake and ezra would consider trying these confections on the show"
09:40;09:42;"I don't see at snickers trying a corporate collaboration"
09:42;09:48;"And what he's talking about is butterfinger has teamed up with krispy kreme donuts"
09:48;09:50;"This is what the butterfinger tweet says"
09:51;09:59;"This is from at butterfinger brace yourself for one-of-a-kind collision of krispity and crunchity goodness. They don't brace yourself"
09:59;10:06;"They're not joking krispity and crunchity goodness that only happens when butterfinger and at krispy kreme donuts team up"
10:06;10:09;"hashtag krispity"
10:09;10:10;"cravings"
10:10;10:12;"I guess cravings"
10:12;10:14;"No one's craving that"
10:14;10:16;"and basically"
10:16;10:21;"Krispy kreme is presenting two different types of butterfinger donuts a collision of krispity cravings"
10:21;10:24;"And this is also funny considering what we talked about last time"
10:24;10:31;"The first reply to this tweet is somebody saying if they're half as awful as your new formula for the butterfingers"
10:31;10:36;"I'll pass go back to the old taste brace yourself for a near toxic collision"
10:36;10:38;"of krispity"
10:38;10:46;"And crunchity so it looks like one of them is like a filled donut and one of them is like a chocolate eclair or something"
10:46;10:49;"The funny thing is we have some modello beer here"
10:49;10:57;"Which is time crisis classic that could be on the next mountain bruise ep a donuts and beer"
10:57;11:00;"Yeah, we're doing donuts and beer. This is disgusting"
11:00;11:03;"I ran into a friend of the show nick kerkovich last week"
11:03;11:08;"He's like, oh I went for a run the other day throwing the new time crisis and I was like, oh, yeah, he's like"
11:08;11:11;"First like 40 minutes was about butterfingers"
11:11;11:16;"Then I was like, do you mean that in a good way or a bad way? He's like bad way, dude"
11:16;11:22;"Wasn't feeling it was not feeling it because he doesn't like butterfingers. He's not feeling the butterfingers content"
11:22;11:27;"Yikes. Yep. Well, here's what some negative feedback from the fan base"
11:27;11:31;"Here's what happens when you triple down on something this one's for you nick"
11:31;11:36;"When you triple down on something like butterfingers, yeah, you're gonna lose a few people"
11:36;11:43;"It's true, but I know that we got some ogbf heads who listen to time crisis and they've just been on cloud nine"
11:44;11:47;"Never did I think my favorite show my favorite candy bar"
11:47;11:51;"Would collide in quite this way. There's somebody who's just been like waiting"
11:51;11:57;"100 episodes deep like these guys never talk about butterfingers. I mean they're talking snickers. They're talking"
11:57;12:01;"The pepsi co portfolio. What about butterfinger, man?"
12:01;12:09;"Just waiting they're talking mars. All right. Well, here's the thing the butterfinger arc is more or less over"
12:09;12:15;"So the haters will be happy and the lovers you get one more thing, which is us eating these donuts. Oh, this is"
12:15;12:18;"I was gonna try to break it in half"
12:18;12:24;"Yeah, but there's like a disgusting frosting on the top which now I have all over my fingers. Oh, no"
12:24;12:26;"We've got the butterfinger original filled donut"
12:26;12:32;"It's an original glazed donut filled with peanut butter chocolate cream dipped in butterfinger icing and topped with butterfinger pieces"
12:32;12:34;"And a chocolate drizzle"
12:34;12:41;"it's always hilarious when you get like write-ups for these kind of like cross-branded food products because they have to put like the uh,"
12:41;12:49;"The registered trademark thing next to butterfinger each time the butterfinger are original filled donut and an original glazed art"
12:49;12:57;"And then the other one is a fudge cake donut, which features a rich chocolate cake donut dipped in chocolate icing blah blah blah"
12:57;12:59;"So, okay. Let's give this a try"
13:01;13:04;"I gotta say this is pointless. I mean it's redundant to me"
13:04;13:08;"This is without a point. They just taste like regular ass donuts"
13:08;13:15;"They hyped up this crispity crunchity collision, you know, eat a butterfinger if you want butterfinger flavor eat a donut if you want donut"
13:15;13:19;"This is not particularly interesting. It doesn't really taste and like it just tastes like a donut"
13:19;13:21;"I think if they put in more time"
13:21;13:26;"They probably could have really crafted a donut that got at the essence of what a butterfinger is all about right?"
13:26;13:29;"No, it's just a normal frosted donut with like"
13:29;13:37;"Some of that like butter finger interior just crumbled on top of the donut butterfingers have a lot of interiority"
13:37;13:44;"I mean, yeah butterfingers actually are kind of a complex flavor and we're losing that. Yeah, it's not bad. It's just nothing special"
13:44;13:46;"Butterfingers a special candy"
13:46;13:49;"This is not special"
13:49;13:53;"Jake, you have any feelings about krispy kreme? Not really. I'm not a donut guy"
13:53;13:59;"It would almost be on brand if you were a donut guy, especially at an la where there's still so many of these like yeah"
13:59;14:03;"Mom and pop independent. There's a gbv song called donut for a snowman"
14:03;14:10;"I think he was writing it as like a fake ad for krispy kreme. Yeah, he mentions. Um, krispy kreme in it"
14:10;14:27;"Starts off the day"
14:28;14:32;"With the krispy kreme. I also think that the idea of this butterfinger"
14:32;14:36;"Donut is redundant or it doesn't make any sense not redundant"
14:36;14:40;"But like it doesn't make any sense because the krispy kreme also is a very specific"
14:40;14:42;"kind of"
14:42;14:50;"Texture and taste itself and by partnering with anybody you're sort of ruining the integrity of what makes a krispy kreme donut sort of special"
14:50;14:52;"Hello the integrity"
14:52;14:58;"Everything goes right for her when everything goes wrong"
14:58;15:03;"She turns around"
15:03;15:10;"At the heart of the drop pizza and also I mean from here from where I said, it looks disgusting it is"
15:10;15:13;"Looks what she's found"
15:13;15:18;"When the gawkers and squawkers exchange their costumes"
15:21;15:23;"She loves the good human man"
15:23;15:30;"He says they don't call us that she run like fluent through the streets"
15:49;15:51;"Interesting song"
15:51;15:54;"Donut"
15:54;16:02;"Donut for a snowman is it because robert potter's famous for going like a little bit english with his delivery, right? Oh, yeah"
16:02;16:06;"Yeah, krispy kreme is a funny one because are you a fan? Not really? I'm duncan"
16:06;16:11;"Of course, I guess I understand the krispy kreme on the box. This is the original since 1937"
16:11;16:14;"It has this kind of like"
16:14;16:21;"Old america feel is it a socal chain or I don't know if it's from 37 probably not right?"
16:21;16:23;"I find krispy kreme to be like too rich"
16:23;16:29;"Like i'm not a big fan of like super intense like sweets and confections"
16:29;16:36;"Krispy kreme is from north carolina, even when i'm like at like a super like bougie fancy bakery"
16:36;16:40;"I don't like baked goods really in the morning"
16:41;16:46;"Like having a cup of coffee with like a buttery or sweet like sort of like croissant or something"
16:46;16:48;"It's just like too much"
16:48;16:52;"I need protein. I know what you mean. I mean, of course coffee goes well with"
16:52;16:58;"With a donut or a croissant it tastes good and then like 45 minutes later. I just like crash"
16:58;17:03;"Yeah, I need some sort of base. Yeah, it's not yet that it wreaks havoc on your body"
17:03;17:06;"Yeah, so krispy kreme in 1933"
17:07;17:12;"18 year old vernon rudolph along with his brother louis rudolph began working for his uncle"
17:12;17:17;"Ishmael armstrong who owned a small general store in paducah, kentucky"
17:17;17:23;"That sold a wide variety of goods including its very popular donuts and the store was struggling during the great depression"
17:23;17:26;"So then vernon and his uncle moved to nashville, tennessee"
17:26;17:30;"And they started focusing solely on their donuts the krispy kreme donut company"
17:30;17:35;"So I guess it really started in nashville and then vernon went to winston-salem"
17:35;17:40;"To really get things popping the reason he chose winston-salem is he learned that his favorite"
17:40;17:46;"Cigarette company camel cigarettes was headquartered there. That's that healthy mid-20th century american lifestyle"
17:46;17:49;"I mean, you know, it's like the silicon valley vibe now"
17:49;17:54;"Somebody just like google's up in mountain view. Let's go headquarter our startup out there"
17:54;17:55;"um"
17:55;18:01;"My memory of krispy kreme is that the only donut chain I knew was dunkin donuts in jersey, new york"
18:01;18:06;"And then I feel like in the early 2000s or something. Yeah, suddenly there were krispy kremes everywhere"
18:06;18:11;"They must have gotten some serious vc money. Yeah to expand like really rapidly"
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, I even remember that there at first people"
18:13;18:21;"Talked about it. I guess this often happens when like a regional chain goes national if they do it correctly at first people like oh"
18:21;18:27;"Krispy kreme. That's amazing. That's here now, dude. That's here now, dude. So much better than duncan"
18:27;18:33;"There's also this thing about krispy kremes where they light up the logo or something when the donuts are fresh"
18:33;18:38;"Are you familiar with this? No, I think it's like, you know, they have their logo up on a pole"
18:38;18:43;"Like so you're driving on the highway and like there's some sort of like bat signal thing. That's like fresh batch out"
18:43;18:45;"That's such bs"
18:45;18:48;"I mean, it might be true, but aren't they constantly making the donuts?"
18:48;18:53;"I don't know now was that duncan that had that ad campaign with the guy getting up at like"
18:54;18:59;"Two in the morning the like short bald guy with a mustache. Of course, you remember the famous couch race"
18:59;19:03;"What was it again? I don't time to make the donut time to make the donuts"
19:03;19:07;"Kind of a depressing ad in retrospect. I mean some guy"
19:07;19:09;"getting up probably making"
19:09;19:10;"minimum wage"
19:10;19:12;"Maybe a little bit more because he's the opening shift and like"
19:12;19:16;"Getting up in the dead of night going into the duncan to make the donuts"
19:16;19:23;"That's one of those like ad campaigns that people like slightly older people like still quote. Oh, he was fred the baker. Let's listen"
19:23;19:26;"time to make the donuts"
19:26;19:33;"The donut it isn't easy owning a duncan don't make the dough because unlike most supermarkets"
19:33;19:39;"We make our donuts fresh day and night the guys who make supermarket donuts are still in bed"
19:39;19:42;"Plain donuts aren't enough"
19:42;19:44;"five"
19:44;19:48;"Of course interesting. It's like supposed to be depressing. I didn't quite remember that"
19:48;19:51;"This is the original ad from 1981. So this guy fred the baker"
19:52;19:56;"You know, he's like a real east coast guy very regional accent very regional accent"
19:56;19:59;"I mean kind of a call back to the car ad"
19:59;20:01;"Yeah, this is before smart pack"
20:01;20:05;"So fred is this kind of uh, maybe we can find some info on fred the baker"
20:05;20:10;"But the way he looks he's a kind of short bald. He's got a danny devito vibe"
20:10;20:16;"He was portrayed by the actor michael vail and michael vail grew up in uh, brooklyn born in 1922"
20:17;20:20;"And he was a uh, okay. So he was about 60 doing those ads"
20:20;20:23;"So he was just like a real new york character actor kind of vibe"
20:23;20:29;"Oh, and he also played sam breakstone for craft foods breakstone line of cottage cheese and sour cream products"
20:29;20:34;"Okay, so he was like a big commercial actor, but I guess he's an he's an archetypal"
20:34;20:38;"New york guy and this is this funny thing about dunkin donuts"
20:38;20:42;"People who were harshed out by us going too long on the butterfinger last episode are gonna be very happy"
20:42;20:45;"They're doing so much donut talk this one's for you nick"
20:46;20:47;"Thank you"
20:47;20:53;"Enough with the butterfingers. Let's get into some donut. We're pivoting. So we talk about duncan a lot on this show"
20:53;20:58;"I understand that it's a massachusetts based company and it's like so bostony"
20:58;21:03;"Yeah, you know to the point that snl did right a sketch about it with casey affleck"
21:03;21:07;"Where he's like this kind of like stereotype of like a masshole"
21:07;21:10;"getting in fights and the whole joke was like"
21:10;21:13;"Yeah going to dunk is the best part of my day"
21:13;21:17;"Kind of vibe. But anyway, obviously like boston and new york two sides of the same coin"
21:17;21:22;"And you know, it's not like there's a new york regional donut chain like, you know, it's big in new york"
21:22;21:28;"But I did notice that when eli manning retired because you know, i'm a big sports fan"
21:28;21:29;"I know a lot about sports"
21:29;21:34;"He was the quarterback for the giants and I think he played his last game this past season, right?"
21:34;21:36;"Getting some nods from the sports nuts in the room"
21:36;21:39;"So, you know, that's a really big deal and in the new york area"
21:39;21:47;"He appeared in a lot of uh, dunkin donuts commercials just regional ads. Well, not national campaigns. I don't know if you can put a uh,"
21:47;21:54;"A duncan ad with a new york giant on the air in the boston area. I don't think you can"
21:54;22:01;"Yeah, it's a metro new york. That's sick. But think about this the metro new york area is bigger than belgium. That's a country"
22:01;22:06;"Sure, it's bigger than australia. It's about the same number of people as australia. Maybe more wow"
22:07;22:09;"Yeah, I mean is there a national chain?"
22:09;22:15;"that has uh maintained its regional identity as strongly as duncan, I don't think so"
22:15;22:21;"Like we all know starbucks is from seattle, but seattle's not really a part of their identity anymore"
22:21;22:23;"You know, we know the mcdonald's is from"
22:23;22:30;"Southern california, I guess like popeyes still makes a big thing about being like southern like louisiana"
22:30;22:33;"Yeah, louis popeyes is a louisiana kitchen"
22:33;22:37;"I feel like that's more of like corporate kind of like pr"
22:37;22:41;"Right. I feel like duncan truly is like but duncan is truly east coast"
22:41;22:42;"but anyway"
22:42;22:47;"I was interested because people from massachusetts are like duncan's ours and then i'm kind of like I know it is but it's also"
22:47;22:50;"So just east coast"
22:50;22:54;"and so I was curious when I realized it was eli's last day and and of course there's an"
22:54;22:59;"Outpouring of admiration and grief from a lot of people in the new york area"
22:59;23:03;"The first thing that crossed my mind is that I wonder if duncan tweeted about this"
23:03;23:08;"Because on the one hand they have this long history with this guy doing commercials"
23:08;23:11;"But on the other hand, they're so associated with massachusetts"
23:11;23:15;"And I looked in at duncan the official at duncan donuts"
23:15;23:18;"Twitter account didn't do it and I tweeted at them. Why don't you guys?"
23:18;23:22;"Congratulate eli on his career or whatever and they didn't write back"
23:22;23:24;"corporate"
23:24;23:26;"cowards"
23:26;23:28;"Dubai"
23:28;23:53;"Through my fever dream houston just did 99. Dubai's 118"
23:54;23:56;"Houston"
23:56;24:23;"She always thinks I cheat I think about those ten days when life is light and sweet"
24:24;24:27;"Anyway, so fred the baker it was funny listening back to that because"
24:27;24:32;"The whole point is that he's like a guy who owns a duncan donuts. So he's like a small-time entrepreneur"
24:32;24:37;"Oh, so he's not an employee. He's like a franchisee. I think that's how they started like when you own a duncan donuts"
24:37;24:39;"Let's listen to the beginning again"
24:39;24:41;"So just to paint a picture for everybody fred"
24:41;24:49;"His wife is sound asleep. His alarm clock is in the foreground. It rings. He opens his eyes in his bed and he looks pissed"
24:50;24:55;"Is it at the time on it? This is very low quality on youtube, but it looks like it's about 3 30 a.m"
24:55;24:57;"Okay, just the dead of night"
24:57;25:07;"It isn't easy owning a duncan donuts, I guess this is like reagan era"
25:07;25:13;"Realistically fred was sleeping in it's his hard-working employees are probably who knows the owner might be down there"
25:13;25:16;"But I would say back in the 70s and 80s"
25:16;25:20;"I bet a lot more duncans were owned by the actual franchisees"
25:20;25:23;"Now it's franchise corporations will own"
25:23;25:28;"30 or 40 locations right and hire the general manager to run"
25:28;25:30;"each location"
25:30;25:36;"And also it's not individual franchisees and the wealth gap has grown so much the idea that the boss"
25:36;25:43;"Is in the mix maybe in 1981. It was a little different. Sure. So fred is basically sleepwalking now"
25:44;25:47;"Time to make the donuts. It's funny if you I haven't seen this in"
25:47;25:55;"Maybe since the 90s if you ask me what the story was with fred the baker for whatever reason my maybe my child brain"
25:55;25:59;"Didn't recognize what the commercial was really about. I would have been like, oh, yeah fred the baker"
25:59;26:01;"He's like a key blu-ray elf or something"
26:01;26:06;"No, and actually the first thing that I could think of time to make the donuts is in the beginning of um"
26:06;26:13;"What's the movie with uh, where owen wilson plays kind of a drifter who takes a bunch of kids under his wing?"
26:14;26:18;"Hmm, it's not one of his more popular films, but i've seen almost all of his movies"
26:18;26:23;"Oh drill bit taylor you ever see drill bit taylor never heard of it. He basically plays a weird drifter"
26:23;26:28;"Who takes a bunch of kids under his wing and encourages them to like stand up to bullies and stuff?"
26:28;26:33;"It's a comedy but I remember the when his character is introduced. He's uh"
26:33;26:40;"Living in a tent like by the highway and he kind of wakes up comes out of his tent goes time to make the donuts"
26:41;26:44;"And he's kind of like, you know almost as if it was like something to be excited about. So anyway"
26:44;26:49;"If you asked me I would have said that time to make the donuts is about like"
26:49;26:54;"Greeting the morning in a positive way time to make the donut and I feel like that's kind of what it became"
26:54;27:00;"I think it became a rise and shine. I think it became a bit of a rise and shine situation"
27:00;27:01;"like"
27:01;27:03;"like I feel like there are probably a lot of"
27:03;27:08;"Workplaces where somebody would come in and be like, all right fellas time to make the donuts. Let's get to work, right?"
27:08;27:13;"But then you watch the original commercial and fred the baker. He's so tired. He hates it grueling"
27:13;27:18;"Maybe he had his own donut shop in brooklyn back in the 60s and 70s"
27:18;27:20;"And then you know"
27:20;27:26;"Suffocating economic conditions went for the safety of the franchise brand times got tough"
27:26;27:32;"And yeah, he was watching all his friends in the old neighborhood get squeezed and he said, you know what? You can't fight progress"
27:32;27:35;"I'm gonna open up a duncan. It's a brand people know"
27:35;27:37;"I had two different friends"
27:37;27:39;"dads who ran"
27:39;27:40;"baskin robbins"
27:40;27:42;"franchises"
27:42;27:47;"One when I was like in middle school and then one in a friend of mine in college his dad had a baskin"
27:47;27:52;"And it seemed tough because you're hiring like high school kids to scoop ice cream"
27:52;27:56;"And of course their friends are coming in. Uh-huh, and they're hooking their friends up"
27:56;28:02;"And I remember my friend dave always telling me that his dad's mantra was portion control"
28:03;28:11;"Portion control I bet a lot of uh children of dunk of a baskin robbins franchisees are probably like libertarians now, right?"
28:11;28:14;"What was your friend's name?"
28:14;28:19;"Which one one of the baskin robbins? Yeah. Yeah, dave. You just hit him up like it was up dave. You're gonna vote for bernie"
28:19;28:23;"Jake, here's why democratic socialism can't work. Let me tell you a little story"
28:23;28:28;"My dad used to own baskin robbins. Yeah, I know it sounds good in theory, man"
28:28;28:33;"But people can't help themselves his employees were giving out literal handouts"
28:33;28:36;"It doesn't work. I mean literally the economics don't support it"
28:36;28:40;"So fred the baker, I just want to get to the rest of the commercial. He's walking in a daze"
28:40;28:45;"He's so tired 3 30 a.m. The wife is still sleeping. He puts on his uniform"
28:45;28:50;"Fresh day and the guys who make supermarket donuts are still in bed"
28:50;28:55;"I bet the guys that are making supermarket donuts are still in bed"
28:55;28:58;"It's like costanza's"
28:58;29:00;"Parents. Yeah, because he's his mom, right?"
29:02;29:04;"George george"
29:04;29:10;"It's interesting that drawing this distinction between dunkin donuts and like supermarket donuts. I guess they had to"
29:10;29:17;"It's like are we really kind of splitting hairs there? Yeah, you are supermarket donuts then it cuts to him"
29:17;29:22;"He's there with his employees. They're all wearing little paper hats. They all look pretty tired"
29:22;29:27;"Five times of course and then he slaps one of the guys in the face"
29:27;29:29;"Which is strange?"
29:29;29:31;"There is one"
29:31;29:36;"They taste so great. Good morning, folks people buy an awful lot of this is actually a really harsh commercial"
29:36;29:43;"He's basically pissed off through 99% of the commercial and then they go like but there's one good part and he turns around and sees"
29:43;29:49;"The store loaded with people and then he finally he cracks a smile and then the narrator goes that one good thing about it"
29:49;29:56;"People buy an awful lot about of them. It's interesting. This is 1981 beginning of the reagan years just like basically being like"
29:57;30:02;"Yeah, life is harsh. You wake up in the middle of the night. It's like but you know what your reward is cold hard cash"
30:02;30:05;"Selling a dozen donuts for 4.99"
30:05;30:08;"It's"
30:08;30:13;"Wikipedia page it says fred was so popular with consumers that when dunka donuts decided to retire the character"
30:13;30:16;"The chain surveyed customers to determine the reaction to the move"
30:16;30:20;"Customers said fred could leave if he were treated like an honored friend and employee"
30:20;30:24;"So the company created an official retirement campaign for him"
30:24;30:31;"Including a celebration in the city of boston and a free donut day that served over 6 million customers on september 22nd 1997"
30:31;30:33;"hell of a run"
30:33;30:39;"16 year run time to make the donuts. Here's another one from 86. Let's see what's going on here"
30:39;30:53;"You know what he's happier in this one maybe he eventually got happy"
30:54;30:57;"Either upper management or the advertising firm was like"
30:57;31:01;"You know what looking back at the original campaign from 81 that was"
31:01;31:03;"gritty"
31:03;31:05;"Right that was too real right"
31:05;31:08;"It was 1981, but we were still in the 70s"
31:08;31:11;"It was like a 70s corsese"
31:11;31:19;"They're like now it's 86 like come on feel good. This is the john hughes era. Let's let's brighten it up a little bit"
31:19;31:24;"It's also weird is that even though his catchphrase is time to make the donuts in these commercials"
31:24;31:30;"The tagline that they actually like show on screen at the end of the commercial is dunkin donuts. It's worth the trip"
31:30;31:34;"So maybe at this point that's the fixation with supermarket donuts"
31:34;31:40;"Maybe in the 80s duncan was like people are going to the supermarket buying all their groceries and they're buying their donuts there"
31:40;31:42;"We need to remind people"
31:42;31:47;"That it's worth coming in for our donuts worth the extra stop fred was very popular"
31:47;31:50;"There's a commercial where he's hawking a dunkin donuts cereal"
31:50;31:54;"Time to make the idea of donuts as a grocery item"
31:54;31:58;"You're at the grocery store"
31:58;32:00;"shopping for your family"
32:00;32:06;"Because I guess people would buy like those like intimate like, you know, like a box of powdered donuts. Oh, yeah"
32:06;32:08;"You definitely buy edmunds"
32:08;32:12;"Fred looks like ron jeremy"
32:12;32:18;"Oh, dude, you're right. I think he's ron jeremy's also like a new york guy. He's just a little more clean-cut"
32:18;32:22;"Yeah, he's a more clean-cut ron jeremy be funny if they knew each other they were like cousins"
32:22;32:26;"Yeah, maybe they're from the same neighborhood as like bernie sanders and larry david"
32:26;32:29;"fred the baker ron jeremy"
32:29;32:32;"barbara streisand"
32:32;32:39;"Just brooklyn legends. I knew fred back in the day. Sure dude, like like a bernie knew fred. Yeah"
32:41;32:48;"Anyway, I feel like there's a thing with krispy kreme that they would put out a bat signal when when there was really fresh donuts"
32:48;32:52;"So that's my first memory is being you know, again growing I grew up with dunkin, but then"
32:52;32:58;"Maybe being college age. Yeah and being somewhere and somebody being like driving on the highway"
32:58;33:05;"Maybe like going upstate or something and somebody being like yo, they got fresh. She's at krispy kreme. Let's go man. So i'm pal"
33:05;33:10;"What's up, will clinton was a big proponent of the krispy kreme back in the day, right? Oh, really?"
33:10;33:13;"Yeah, that's what that's in the 90s. Yeah, that's how I first heard about it. Okay"
33:13;33:19;"I think bill was really into fast food. He's a southerner really into mickey d's. Uh-huh"
33:19;33:21;"I guess that's something that"
33:21;33:25;"That clinton and trump have in common is they're both in the mickey d's"
33:25;33:30;"There's a video of him touring the krispy kreme factory here. It looks like he's having the time of his life clinton"
33:30;33:32;"Yeah, what year?"
33:32;33:35;"96. Oh, so he's president. Yeah"
33:36;33:40;"Height of clinton just that our taxpayer dollars at work. Yeah"
33:40;33:46;"I mean presidents are always just like touring factories for like whatever reason you could imagine them be like, you know, sir"
33:46;33:48;"We you think that'd be a good"
33:48;33:52;"visual get the american people see you just like on the floor of a factory and just like"
33:52;33:58;"They're like we're thinking this like steel plant in pennsylvania's like how about krispy kreme? Come on, man"
33:58;34:05;"What would be a good factory to tour if you were president, yeah, I mean I guess the tough part is there's you know"
34:06;34:12;"So much american industry's moved to other countries. I was thinking like fender, but no there. I don't think there is a fender"
34:12;34:14;"Oh, maybe there is I think there's still a small shop"
34:14;34:18;"Strats. Yeah, right the wiffle ball factory in shelton, connecticut"
34:18;34:24;"Is that I would tour there i've never been there. Yeah, we're driving past it all the time as a kid"
34:24;34:27;"It was like a small cinder block building with a giant"
34:27;34:34;"Illuminated wiffle ball on the top. Oh, that's cool. He just said wiffle wiffle ball is a brand name, right?"
34:34;34:39;"Oh, yeah, like that classic yellow bat with the white wiffle ball. Yep. Not just anybody can make that"
34:39;34:45;"No, that is a brand from connecticut shelton, connecticut. I gotta say things are kind of looking up for connecticut"
34:45;34:49;"That's true when we're keeping score on the tri-state"
34:49;34:56;"Wiffle ball does not get thrown in the mix and it should goose and wiffle ball man. Nothing to sneeze at solid foundation"
34:57;34:59;"I was born in 63"
34:59;35:09;"Got a little job in the factory. I don't know much about kennedy. I was too busy working in the factory"
35:09;35:22;"We got a kid dance too we got another one to do we get by the best we can do"
35:22;35:25;"Factory's got a good medical plan"
35:26;35:28;"Because i'm a union man"
35:28;35:37;"You're listening to"
35:37;35:44;"Time crisis on beat one. It is funny to think too that there there used to be a type of ad"
35:44;35:50;"Especially like regional ads. Do you know this one? I can't remember. I only remember the vague"
35:50;35:54;"Uh details of it because it's an la ad so I was only hip to it when I came out here"
35:55;35:59;"And the la ogs would tell me about it. It's got a bit of that like, you know, crazy eddie"
35:59;36:03;"Energy. Oh, yeah, that's the funny thing when trump calls bernie crazy bernie"
36:03;36:11;"That just sounds like a guy selling electronics in new york. Totally. Well, mr. Trump. I may be crazy, but I got deals that you can't beat"
36:11;36:14;"The debate"
36:14;36:16;"crazy, oh god"
36:16;36:21;"Crazy bernie. Anyway, so this has a little bit of that just like wild man, you know crazy"
36:22;36:27;"Energy, but this is out here in la and it's also like two guys with accents and I think they're brothers"
36:27;36:29;"and um"
36:29;36:32;"This might be hard to search la people will know immediately what i'm talking about"
36:32;36:34;"But basically it's two brothers and one of the brothers is always"
36:34;36:42;"Whatever they sell electronics furnitures cars, whatever one of the brothers is always giving the public amazing deals"
36:42;36:44;"and the other brothers"
36:44;36:47;"Is kind of like the accountant type?"
36:47;36:54;"So he's I think his catchphrase is so one brother's like this president's day i'm going all out i'm going 50 off sofas"
36:54;36:58;"I'm going 25 and then the other brother goes you're killing me larry"
36:58;37:02;"He's is it it's you're killing me larry, right? Who are these guys?"
37:02;37:07;"Sit and sleep. Yeah, this is total like socal but I feel like"
37:07;37:12;"The millennial vibe of like selling products is way more of a creepy utopian vibe"
37:13;37:16;"Like I don't think any like kind of startup will ever just like show the warts"
37:16;37:20;"And everything has to be kind of like perfect and like a smile on your face"
37:20;37:27;"Like imagine if like it would actually humanize him a lot if like zuckerberg or something had some foil where marsh is like"
37:27;37:34;"Hey guys, i'm mark zuckerberg and i'm gonna continue giving you this free product facebook as long as you continue to let me harvest your data"
37:34;37:40;"But I will never charge you for the goods and services that we provide and then his buddy's like you're killing me mark"
37:40;37:44;"Come on, we should be charging these people 9.99. He'd be like, uh, calm down fred"
37:44;37:50;"You know like there's something about fred the baker you're killing me larry like and like"
37:50;37:55;"I must be crazy to give you guys these deals. What the fuck is wrong where"
37:55;38:00;"It's more depressing, but it's weirdly also like more human. Oh for sure where the person is like"
38:00;38:07;"Listen being a business owner is kind of like harsh and stressful. Yeah, and also there's something about it too"
38:07;38:11;"Very tight margins. You're not they're not trying to hide the fact that"
38:11;38:16;"Running a business means like not getting a lot of sleep waking up early and stressing about money"
38:16;38:23;"Yeah, like that's something that like the average joke could relate to more versus today. Everything is like hey, we're really smart"
38:23;38:25;"Your life is chaos"
38:25;38:27;"What we provide"
38:27;38:28;"Is ordered beauty?"
38:28;38:33;"We understand, you know, like that's the vibe of most kind of like millennial advertising"
38:33;38:36;"And maybe because back in the day people actually owned businesses"
38:37;38:42;"Whereas now like so many things just like giant companies. Yeah, that's the thing. Nobody's gonna buy a billionaire"
38:42;38:46;"Sitting there just being like i'm pulling my hair. I'm figuring out how to you know, right?"
38:46;38:52;"But you know when it's like even a guy who owns 40 mattress shops. Yeah, the guys that own sit and sleep are"
38:52;38:59;"Loaded they got a couple hundred mil in the bank. Yeah, but even then they're still like it's also sweating the details"
38:59;39:05;"Even guys with a couple hundred million are not as harsh as like, you know people with 60 billion dollars"
39:05;39:11;"Oh, no, if all that bernie had to deal with were the sit and sleep guys, we'd have an equitable society overnight"
39:11;39:14;"I sat down with larry"
39:14;39:16;"Listen, larry's got problems"
39:16;39:23;"I missed that energy. Yeah, I think it's just because the way our economy works has changed so much that nobody buys that character anymore"
39:23;39:25;"No more fred the baker"
39:25;39:30;"No more, you're killing me larry. I'm also not plugged into advertising on local tv at all"
39:30;39:34;"Yeah, I bet you still have some of these like holdovers from that era. Oh, i'm sure"
39:35;39:37;"If I watched like the morning"
39:37;39:40;"like ktla"
39:40;39:42;"right morning show"
39:42;39:48;"While making breakfast and like they were like at like local like orange county car dealership ads. I'm sure there'd be"
39:48;39:51;"Right that kind of stuff. You're killing me larry"
39:51;39:54;"Now speaking of east coast energy"
39:54;39:57;"We scored a really hot interview"
39:57;40:02;"Oh, i'm psyched for this. We've been scoring a lot of hot guests lately. We're gonna talk to the two people"
40:02;40:08;"Pearl gable and megan coin you might not know their names yet, but you've probably seen their work on twitter"
40:08;40:15;"We've been talking about it. These are two of the people behind the at nj gov twitter account, which has been blowing up"
40:15;40:18;"Tri-state area is really killing it. You got goose on the jam band scene"
40:18;40:23;"You got at nj gov on the state the official state twitter accounts all tri-state"
40:23;40:26;"Anyway, let's talk to them"
40:26;40:29;"Now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
40:29;40:31;"All right"
40:31;40:34;"Hey pearl and megan"
40:34;40:36;"Yes. Hello"
40:36;40:41;"Hey, what's up guys? Welcome to time crisis. Hey, thanks so much for having us. Yeah. Thank you"
40:41;40:45;"We're thrilled to have you I gotta ask just out of pure ego"
40:45;40:52;"Is this the first internet radio show you guys have done press for the first and only oh amazing"
40:52;40:58;"We really got a scoop here forget about that new york times story. This is it. This is nice right now"
40:59;41:02;"Okay. So first of all, what is your guys job? How do you describe it?"
41:02;41:06;"So within the governor's office in new jersey"
41:06;41:14;"There's a communications team and that's like the press team speech writers in that there's the digital team and that's kind of"
41:14;41:20;"Does everything from social media to overseeing the website working with all the agencies?"
41:20;41:23;"multimedia like photography videos"
41:23;41:27;"so all that stuff so i'm the digital director and"
41:27;41:34;"Came in when governor murphy came into new jersey and megan. I think you can do one take over. Yeah"
41:34;41:35;"um"
41:35;41:41;"So kind of what pearl said so mostly we we do social and and the website I specifically just do"
41:41;41:47;"Writing social media content for the governor's social media accounts and for njgov and then pearl does"
41:47;41:51;"Um, she pretty much does everything else. She does videos. She's a photographer"
41:51;41:55;"And then she also does the writing too and then we have a third member"
41:55;41:58;"Which is edwin torres who's really the governor's photographer?"
41:58;42:04;"Okay, this is interesting because I think me and like a lot of people, uh, no disrespect to governor murphy"
42:04;42:08;"But when we hear at njgov, we're so used to seeing like websites that are dot gov"
42:08;42:13;"I think most people think of it as just like this is the twitter account of the state of new jersey"
42:13;42:17;"Which in a way it is but the correct way to describe at njgov"
42:17;42:22;"Is this the official twitter account of the new jersey governor's office as the governor's office?"
42:22;42:25;"We can run the state of new jersey twitter"
42:26;42:32;"I see does that make sense? Yeah, I see. Yeah, and also maybe it's worth pointing out that governor murphy is is a democrat. Yeah"
42:32;42:36;"So, you know if he loses in the next election to a republican"
42:36;42:38;"Are you guys out of a job?"
42:38;42:44;"Not only are we out of a job, but we're handing over the keys to all of those accounts to whoever's coming into office"
42:44;42:50;"Okay, so that's pretty harsh. So you guys have I mean how many followers have you added to this account over the past few months?"
42:50;42:54;"So the account actually didn't exist before governor murphy was the governor"
42:55;43:00;"So pearl spearheaded this effort when the governor became governor pearl went in as his digital director and she's"
43:00;43:03;"So uh, like spearheaded the account it was her brainchild"
43:03;43:07;"And then really in the last few months was when we started to"
43:07;43:16;"I guess kind of break the internet and in one weekend we gained 50 000 followers and that was the weekend that we tweeted your mom"
43:16;43:18;"Um, your mom was a big one asking"
43:19;43:23;"To respond to someone asking who let us have a twitter account and then that got us to about like"
43:23;43:29;"70 000 and now we're at 200 000. You guys went from zero to 200 000"
43:29;43:31;"Well, I mean, yes, I mean since starting it"
43:31;43:36;"I would say really like since we megan and I started talking about let's make this thing more human"
43:36;43:41;"Let's make this thing more jersey. Let's give personality to it. That was around 16 000"
43:41;43:47;"We were at so when we started giving that personality, I think that was like november from november until now"
43:48;43:52;"Yeah about a little under 200 000 strong. That's strong"
43:52;43:56;"That's really strong growth and I don't think you should have to strong for a little state like new jersey"
43:56;44:01;"Little state with big attitudes. So you guys referenced it, but I just want people who don't know"
44:01;44:03;"We've referenced it on the show as well"
44:03;44:10;"But new jersey gov really went to the next level your guys first crazy viral tweet was like you said somebody tweeted at you"
44:10;44:13;"Who gave new jersey a twitter account and you wrote your mom?"
44:14;44:17;"I was talking about this with my cousin cousin asher that tc heads know"
44:17;44:24;"Well, I also grew up in jersey and we were talking about the fact that there's so many states that have like attitude"
44:24;44:26;"But we're just talking about we're like no state"
44:26;44:30;"And your mom is not like a new jersey catchphrase or anything"
44:30;44:34;"People say your mom like jake growing up did people say your mom in connecticut totally"
44:34;44:37;"But we were talking about the fact that even though your mom is not explicitly new jersey"
44:37;44:40;"And people say that everywhere and there's attitude everywhere"
44:41;44:46;"No other state could say your mom to a person and it would feel so right, you know"
44:46;44:53;"All right, the closest we could come up with was florida and we were like no florida would be like way darker way darker"
44:53;44:59;"And then you know new york. Yeah, new york doesn't quite seem right either only jersey, right?"
44:59;45:04;"So, uh, can you walk us through that moment in history that tweet in particular?"
45:04;45:07;"What's going on? Who was manning the decks?"
45:07;45:12;"We were at our desks at work and we had adjoining cubicles here in the governor's office"
45:12;45:18;"It's a very officey environment, you know fluorescent lighting on that whole and where is it? It's in trenton"
45:18;45:26;"Yeah, we're in trenton, new jersey because people from new jersey because also the governor lives in a gorgeous mansion called drum thwack"
45:26;45:29;"for people"
45:29;45:34;"So that's where the governor lives the governor lives in a gorgeous mansion called drum thwackett"
45:34;45:37;"But you guys don't work at drum thwackett you work in some kind of harsh"
45:37;45:40;"Harsh cubicle in trenton. Yeah, okay"
45:40;45:43;"Yeah, we got a heart we got some harsh cubicles in trenton"
45:43;45:47;"We both happened to be on the twitter account at the same time kind of monitoring it and we both saw"
45:47;45:53;"Someone tag us in that tweet at the same second and I said to pearl something like oh my god"
45:53;45:56;"Did you see what that guy said? Like, you know, what's his deal?"
45:56;46:00;"That's so rude and pearl was like, I know I kind of just want to respond to your mom"
46:01;46:04;"And i've always thought that your mom is like the funniest comeback"
46:04;46:09;"So I started hysterically laughing so that we kind of knew that it was like a gold response"
46:09;46:15;"And then pearl was like it maybe it's too mean like what if something happened to this guy's mom?"
46:15;46:21;"Oh, yeah, that's thoughtful. It was very natural as and I say like as a jersey girl growing up in central jersey"
46:21;46:25;"That was the automatic reaction and then kind of working in this political environment"
46:25;46:30;"It was like pull back for a second and be like, is that too mean megan was just like no, it's a figure speech"
46:31;46:34;"And that was it and then I was like, oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean when you think about it"
46:34;46:37;"You definitely would feel bad"
46:37;46:42;"If the guy wrote back and said hey, my mom's not alive. In fact, she was murdered by a jersey guy"
46:42;46:47;"And this is that's what I imagine. Yeah, that's that would be really harsh. My mom was murdered"
46:47;46:50;"But at the same time"
46:50;46:56;"This guy's out there talking to random twitter account. So he's probably not in the depths of grief"
46:56;46:58;"Right. That's exactly right"
46:58;47:01;"So yeah, I mean so like 30 seconds later"
47:01;47:05;"We dropped it the reason for the hesitation a lot was that we had never done that was like the first one"
47:05;47:10;"That was like that caliber but so so like you thought about when you asked yourself is this too mean?"
47:10;47:13;"Clearly you have latitude, but did you think?"
47:13;47:15;"about"
47:15;47:20;"You know jumping on a horse and riding it to drum thwack it to ask permission from the governor"
47:20;47:26;"Oh, yeah, I mean the phrase really that I like to use we both use this at this time"
47:26;47:33;"Is that kind of when building this idea we thought maybe it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?"
47:33;47:38;"I don't think we would have gotten an a-okay if we ran it through all the approvals"
47:38;47:41;"That we would run through like the governor's"
47:41;47:43;"Language through right? You know what I mean?"
47:43;47:47;"But like after we did it and you saw that it took off and you saw"
47:47;47:52;"What could happen then people understood right risky move?"
47:52;47:57;"It was a risky move like we were like there's been a bunch we've put out and megan will just be like"
47:57;47:59;"All right. It was nice knowing you like, you know, it's been great working together"
47:59;48:06;"This is the last time I see you. We've pretty much prepared ourselves to get fired. So yeah, we're ready. Okay"
48:06;48:13;"Wow, wow. All right good for you true bravery when I in the movie version to governor murphy would be like"
48:13;48:15;"Like they tweeted what?"
48:15;48:20;"Pearl and megan in my office get your asses over to drum thwack it right now"
48:20;48:24;"And then on the way there is like it's like going viral. Yeah, this is the governor's going viral"
48:24;48:31;"What do you mean how many retweets like sir? We just crossed 80 000 retweets and by the time you get there. He's just like"
48:31;48:34;"Ladies, I am so proud of you"
48:34;48:36;"You're promoted. You got the champagne. Yeah"
48:36;48:43;"I would also make the case to him. I'm sure somebody has where it's like, you know what governor murphy"
48:43;48:46;"We got a guy in the white house who pulls no punches"
48:46;48:49;"The discourse has been coarsened beyond belief"
48:49;48:51;"and by the way"
48:51;48:55;"That mean-spirited trash talking man in the white house. He made your predecessor look pretty bad"
48:55;49:02;"He really took new jersey down a few notches. So people don't remember chris christie was our previous governor and trump"
49:02;49:06;"Just was brutally mean to him and the next thing you know, he's appearing behind him"
49:06;49:11;"So anyway, I think it's about time now. We got a democrat down at drum thwack it"
49:11;49:18;"Once again, maybe there's worse things than a tough talking new jersey twitter account, you know what i'm saying?"
49:19;49:23;"I think actually it's uh, it's a kind of redemption arc for the state in a way"
49:23;49:30;"Interesting side note actually chris christie took his account with him when he left which is kind of unheard of"
49:30;49:33;"Like he took the governor's wow. So that's why you guys are starting it"
49:33;49:38;"Is because old chris christie just bounced right? We started gov murphy at"
49:38;49:41;"Did gov murphy accounts at zero and then started nj gov?"
49:41;49:46;"It just had never existed before as far as trump being like part of this conversation"
49:46;49:51;"I mean i'm a progressive administration. I am a progressive but I admire"
49:51;49:54;"trump thing I admire his glitter and"
49:54;49:57;"It's because it's like just this no-holds-barred"
49:57;50:04;"You know people are related to him because he's able to break through some sort of clutter for better or worse"
50:04;50:11;"No, no, I absolutely know what you mean. And it's I think it's sometimes it's scary for people who have the opposite"
50:11;50:14;"Values as trump. Sometimes you don't want to admit"
50:15;50:17;"Why something works?"
50:17;50:22;"And there is something to be said especially for you know for you who's working explicitly in communications"
50:22;50:27;"However, you want to describe it but for you to see what works about his communication technique"
50:27;50:30;"There's something smart about that because I think a lot of people"
50:30;50:35;"A lot of liberals they just want to be like, oh trump's a moron blah blah and they focus on"
50:35;50:39;"things that are true the really negative things and the thing that they're missing out on is like"
50:40;50:46;"But he has this way with words that some people kind of fall for or even I hate to say it are charmed by"
50:46;50:49;"when you disagree so fervently with his"
50:49;50:56;"Political beliefs like most people that I know do the idea that you could say but let's talk about his charm"
50:56;50:58;"That just seems so wrong, right?"
50:58;51:01;"But when you're somebody who has like, you know on the one hand a fun job"
51:01;51:07;"but the idea of communicating on behalf of a politician is a serious job too that if you can't at least step into that world and"
51:07;51:10;"look through the glasses of a"
51:10;51:17;"Somebody who's charmed by him. Yeah, you're missing out on some like kind of basic like some communications 101 type stuff. There's lessons to be learned"
51:17;51:24;"Dizzy with eternity"
51:37;51:44;"A peaceful place where so it loves from space a closer look reveals the human race"
51:44;52:00;"There's a fear that"
52:00;52:02;"Forgot"
52:02;52:06;"Has got a name just"
52:06;52:23;"I want to get a uh, just a little more info about you guys. So you're are you both new jersey natives?"
52:23;52:29;"Yes, we are. Where are you guys from? So i'm from little silver, which is in mammoth county. It's right next to red bag"
52:30;52:37;"Okay, monmouth county that's kind of bruce country, right it's bruce territory. Yes, definitely bruce territory. We got danny devito from down there"
52:37;52:43;"Wendy williams we got a bunch of rock stars. I didn't know she was a jersey girl neptune"
52:43;52:49;"Hi neptune down the shore. That's right. And megan you're from i'm from livingston, which is in asex county"
52:49;52:52;"Oh, yeah, that's my backyard because I grew up in glen ridge"
52:52;52:59;"Livingston, yeah, whatever guys where that so yeah, is it whatever livingston has a famous mall"
52:59;53:01;"It's called the livingston mall"
53:01;53:04;"Yeah"
53:04;53:07;"Now jake my co-host he's from connecticut, that's right"
53:07;53:13;"And i'm curious so you guys clearly spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to embody the voice of new jersey"
53:13;53:15;"And i'm sure you haven't put as much time into thinking about connecticut"
53:15;53:20;"But you know, it's part of the tri-state area what comes to mind when we talk about connecticut?"
53:20;53:22;"You'd be surprised we have some beef with connecticut"
53:22;53:26;"I know if you noticed a couple weeks ago"
53:26;53:31;"But we got into it a little bit with your governor medlamont. I missed this over pizza"
53:31;53:35;"Okay, so new haven was claiming they have the best pizza"
53:35;53:41;"We claimed that new jersey has is the pizza capital of the world and then the governor"
53:41;53:45;"Of connecticut responded that you know, new haven has the best pizza"
53:45;53:51;"So then we responded to him from the governor murphy's account kind of laid down the law and we just said"
53:51;53:56;"We told him to stay in his lane. This was even worse. I want to read. Can I read medlamont's tweet?"
53:56;53:58;"He put this out there"
53:58;54:03;"So when we declared ourselves the pizza capital of the world, which obviously was a big weekend for us"
54:03;54:05;"um"
54:05;54:09;"It's kind of true we have we have some proof to back it up but"
54:09;54:14;"Uh, the governor of connecticut tweets relax, new jersey"
54:14;54:21;"I will proudly proclaim crimped hair day wearing socks of sandals day and don't pump your own gas day in your honor"
54:22;54:26;"But connecticut is clearly the pizza capital of the world. Well, he went hard now"
54:26;54:30;"Was that from his personal account or the ct? This is from his government account"
54:30;54:35;"You see how much is in there? They're called crimped hair day wearing socks"
54:35;54:44;"Yeah overwritten and also all over the place because the crimped hair you're picturing some sort of like 80s jersey girl"
54:44;54:48;"Right. Yeah, you're picturing some kind of like bad taste like like bon jovi. Yeah"
54:49;54:56;"Or like like actually all that stuff is back in now. It's been cyclical. Well, yeah, that stuff is cool. Yeah, he's picturing like, um"
54:56;54:59;"Adriana from the sopranos. He's picturing like"
54:59;55:03;"Like a mafia guy's girlfriend with a crimped hair"
55:03;55:07;"So first of all a little I don't I don't appreciate the the anti-italian american"
55:07;55:10;"Ascendant of that and and there's a lot of great italian americans from connecticut"
55:10;55:17;"So I don't like that one and then socks and sandals. Well, I love socks and sandals, but socks and sandals doesn't connote jersey"
55:17;55:19;"Socks and sandals connotes crunchy"
55:19;55:26;"Crunchy people and you know, you're gonna find socks and sandals in jersey, connecticut upstate new york vermont"
55:26;55:29;"I mean vermont that's a socks and sandals state. Come on"
55:29;55:31;"And what was the last thing he said?"
55:31;55:35;"Oh pumping your own gas. Well, that's yeah, that is a funny thing about new jersey's that"
55:35;55:38;"Is that you can't pump your own gas?"
55:38;55:41;"But that's just that's charming. That's a cute quirk"
55:41;55:46;"Yeah, I thought so obviously connecticut doesn't have good a good writer's room over there"
55:47;55:51;"They were trying too hard way too hard at that moment. That was february 7th"
55:51;55:54;"They were down in washington at a governor's conference"
55:54;56:00;"In fact, the two governors one the one from connecticut and our governor were sitting next to each other at that time"
56:00;56:02;"Oh, man, awkward tensions were running"
56:02;56:06;"Tensions were so high"
56:06;56:08;"So yeah, that's our connecticut thing. Yeah"
56:08;56:16;"Fair, I mean look, I don't really know the backstory on why new haven claims this like supremacy when it comes to pizza"
56:17;56:21;"Pepe's is good. Yeah, pepe's is good. There's a lot of good pizza everywhere"
56:21;56:25;"I would think new york city would be the pizza capital of the world personally. I would"
56:25;56:28;"Cut out ct and nj I go new york on that"
56:28;56:33;"Of the world. I love that. I love that. Italy's not even in the conversation"
56:33;56:35;"Oh"
56:35;56:38;"The idea is that we have so many italian immigrants which by the way"
56:38;56:44;"New jersey has the like the most and they perfected it so they brought it they brought over their idea"
56:44;56:49;"And then perfected it when I said world north america kind of like the world series"
56:49;56:51;"right"
56:51;56:59;"Look there's good pizza anywhere that they're they're like significant numbers of italian immigrants. It's different regionally"
56:59;57:02;"Chicago has a lot of italian people and there's chicago style pizza. It's just different"
57:02;57:07;"But as far as the tri-state goes, you know, i'm not mad at saying new jersey's got the best"
57:07;57:11;"I think that's pushing it. Okay, no matter what it's not connecticut. We can all agree on that"
57:12;57:16;"Well, I mean you got three jersey people right here and I think maybe we're all gonna vote for new jersey"
57:16;57:18;"Yeah, maybe it's not a fair fight"
57:18;57:25;"Now, do you know if uh, ned lamont has two people that are running the connecticut twitter account?"
57:25;57:31;"No clue. We have no idea. We know who runs the delaware twitter account, but that's pretty much it"
57:31;57:35;"Oh, man, what's going on? Yeah, we're kind of like a twitter account"
57:35;57:39;"You know, we historically we don't get along that well with delaware"
57:39;57:41;"Yeah, we're looking through the the delaware.gov"
57:41;57:46;"They're just like retweeting the delaware small business"
57:46;57:50;"Association. Yeah, I mean listen, it's a snooze. I mean like it's fine"
57:50;57:56;"Like that's that's like function that's functional like that. I think that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that stuff"
57:56;57:59;"I don't think everybody can do this. Oh, wait, we think maybe it's unique"
57:59;58:06;"What'd you find we found? Okay, so you guys treated a delaware shout out to delaware hashtag. Love your pet day"
58:07;58:12;"Yeah, that's pretty harsh. They just wrote not hearing that at njgov noise during kindness week"
58:12;58:16;"And then they had a gif of steven colbert plugging his ears and going"
58:16;58:20;"No, they did not sad. Yeah, it's just sad"
58:20;58:28;"So I guess the last question that I have and the reason that we've i've been very pro at njgov on this show is because"
58:28;58:32;"On time credits. We've had a very mixed feelings about corporate food twitters"
58:33;58:38;"And well, you know, we'll admit that some have made history, but there's something so harsh about like stacom's"
58:38;58:45;"Trying to get philosophical and just get down with the kids and we were kind of happy to see that these powers used for good"
58:45;58:49;"You know, like you guys are state employees. You're not selling anything"
58:49;58:55;"I'd rather see that kind of create a personality for the njgov rep more than I want to see it created for brands"
58:55;58:57;"But at the same time"
58:57;59:02;"The brands maybe paved the way for you guys a little bit. Are you students of brand twitter?"
59:03;59:05;"So I have a journalism background like photojournalism"
59:05;59:10;"Video documentary stuff like that. I don't have like this pr"
59:10;59:13;"Background where i've been studying this stuff"
59:13;59:19;"So really this is coming from a pretty raw place and we felt we felt a lot of this was like like new stuff"
59:19;59:23;"For us, I mean and especially for a state, but as we've been doing this"
59:23;59:29;"You know i've been able to see a lot of uh, a lot of these brands and admire them. Well, it's like trump"
59:29;59:34;"You don't admire the yes the uh, the content of the message, but you do admire the technique"
59:34;59:43;"Right, totally and pennsylvania treasury was actually one of our first like loves. Oh, yeah, because the pennsylvania treasury"
59:43;59:48;"That's the real twitter account of the pennsylvania treasury somebody over there gave them the go-ahead to like get political"
59:48;59:55;"I feel like the pennsylvania treasury just like is just tweeting like wild left-wing just like wood blank fine should be in prison"
59:55;59:58;"Abolish the cia"
59:59;01:00:00;"Really"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"Like that was our first"
01:00:02;01:00:07;"And since then, you know, there are other governments and yeah, we are government work. You're right. We're not selling anything"
01:00:07;01:00:14;"Actually, we try to make this as non-partisan as possible aside from talking about the policies and like the news. Well, I was gonna ask"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"Like have you gotten any directives from your bosses to not get too?"
01:00:18;01:00:24;"Sort of political in a in a blue or you know, like democrat or republican sense"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"No, I mean they've really they've stepped back on this one"
01:00:28;01:00:34;"You know what? I mean? Yeah, which as they should because I think these days the american people are familiar with how this stuff works"
01:00:34;01:00:40;"Yeah, you know if you guys maybe one day cross the line a little bit too much governor murphy can say listen pro and megan"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"They run the account"
01:00:42;01:00:48;"They they're the people behind your mom this time. They went one step further than uh, I would have liked to"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"But you know, we talked about it"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"and it is what it is and nobody's gonna be like"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"Well that reflects. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. I don't think you guys are gonna go far"
01:00:57;01:01:03;"That's why we got our cardboard box. We got the cardboard boxes under our desk ready to pack up and ship out"
01:01:03;01:01:09;"As you guys create this kind of new job that didn't really exist which is kind of like being the fun"
01:01:09;01:01:17;"Social media managers for a state government. I wonder if it's eventually going to become like the binary thing that exists"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"like when you're a lawyer you're like the really"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Talented guy who's like slugging it out in the da's office"

01:01:29;01:01:34;"He's like i'm putting i'm putting guys like you in prison and it's like yeah and going back to your apartment"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Come on, man"
01:01:35;01:01:39;"I pulled down five mil last year and I wonder who's gonna be playing we're like we're like one day"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"Somebody comes knocking and it's just like I finally got the call from wendy's"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"And you're just gonna be like come on way to get into it for that"
01:01:46;01:01:50;"Are you asking about our sellout timeline? Like when are we planning?"

01:01:55;01:01:58;"Just have a game plan because I think it could happen"
01:01:58;01:02:02;"One day big business comes calling if I could keep doing good"
01:02:02;01:02:06;"If I could keep like just working like for the people"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"I mean"

01:05:09;01:05:12;"I'm going to try not to do too much editorializing. It's going to be tough for us"
01:05:12;01:05:18;"It's tough for us. Generally when we go through an email for every one line of the email we talk for about 10 minutes"
01:05:18;01:05:24;"Yep, so this would literally be 10 hours. Okay, let's go to the time crisis mailbag"

01:06:53;01:06:57;"We walked up to him and parker put out her hand for a handshake. Jerry went in for the hug"
01:06:57;01:07:03;"After hugging us both and taking some pics. Jerry noted grace's vampire weekend shirt and asked if she was a fan"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"After affirming her status as a head"
01:07:06;01:07:12;"Jerry mentioned that he knew vw had performed for bernie. This is already going better than we could have imagined"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"Well, i'm loving this"
01:07:14;01:07:21;"Um feeling confident. We asked our first question on the docket favorite dead song jerry without hesitation replied ripple classic"
01:07:22;01:07:27;"Very kind nothing more nothing less in grace's excitement. She accidentally said I love rickle"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"awkward"
01:07:30;01:07:35;"Luckily, he was kind enough not to comment on her slip and humiliation was narrowly avoided next question"
01:07:35;01:07:40;"Dream celebrity to create an ice cream for we were pleasantly surprised by jerry's answer"
01:07:40;01:07:47;"He'd explained that they'd done a lot of white men inspired ice cream jerry garcia fish steven colbert, etc"
01:07:47;01:07:53;"The company or at least jerry wants to expand to include flavors inspired by women and people of color"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"At this grace chimed in with what about alanis morissette?"
01:07:56;01:08:01;"Jerry was amused surprised even and suggested that maybe we were born in the wrong generation"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"What they're too young for alanis. Is that what he means? This jury's pretty savvy"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"You guys look like you're uh in college now"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"You're a little young for alas"
01:08:11;01:08:16;"He asked how we got into old music and we said we bonded over learning more about the grateful dead through an internet radio show"
01:08:16;01:08:24;"Called time crisis hosted by vampire weekend frontman ezra kainek an american painter musician and internet radio personality jake longstreth"
01:08:24;01:08:30;"Jerry was surprised to hear that tc was la based mentioning. He thought vw was based in new york"
01:08:30;01:08:38;"Was he ahead? How did he know the vw origin story and if ahead how much so we'd find out soon enough the next thing"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"You know, I actually haven't read this whole email. I'm learning this in real time"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"I'm kind of on the edge of my seat now"
01:08:44;01:08:49;"The next thing we knew jerry was heading behind the counter offering to give us a sample of his favorite flavor"
01:08:49;01:08:56;"Americone dream. That's the steven colbert flavor. I gotta say of all like the uh, celebrity flavors. That's the best one"
01:08:56;01:09:01;"I wish that I loved cherry garcia or fish food. Cherry ice cream is tough"
01:09:01;01:09:06;"Yeah, that's tough and the fish food is is good, but it's got marshmallow in it. It's just yeah"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"Americone dream. I like it's got ice cream cone. It's perfect"
01:09:09;01:09:14;"Anyway, he handed us a sample of americone dream and a sample of the new bnj's flavor"
01:09:14;01:09:17;"netflix and chilled"
01:09:17;01:09:22;"Wow a lot to unpack with that name and grace asked him if he was a curb your enthusiasm fan"
01:09:22;01:09:27;"I'm a moderate fan. Jerry replied verbatim. He explained that sometimes it's too painful to watch"
01:09:27;01:09:32;"To which parker responded but that's part of the fun. The three of us laugh like old friends"
01:09:32;01:09:38;"You know what? I'll say my parents said the same thing about curb like you guys like curb and they're like, oh, it's so awkward"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"It's too harsh to watch"
01:09:39;01:09:44;"I wonder if that's a thing that people who are like of larry's generation are like less into curb"
01:09:44;01:09:50;"Because I feel like the biggest curb heads that I know are all like 20s through 40s. It's like bernie, dude"
01:09:50;01:09:55;"I think it's a real thing. I think larry's more of an icon for millennials than he is for boomers. Oh"
01:09:55;01:10:01;"Absolutely. I could imagine it's just a thing where it's like watching somebody your own age"
01:10:01;01:10:07;"In these truly painfully embarrassing situations. Maybe it just like it resonates in a different way"
01:10:07;01:10:12;"Where when you're looking at somebody who's like 30 plus years older than you you can just like laugh about it"
01:10:12;01:10:19;"Same way that the billy eilish generation loves the office. Anyway, jerry greenfield too painful to watch man"
01:10:19;01:10:24;"After finishing our ice cream we headed out high on the good vibes and the warmth of jerry's kindness"
01:10:24;01:10:29;"Jerry is just such a good name. It really is. Yeah, I bet if bernie was named jerry"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"He'd be even higher in the polls"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Oh jerry sanders"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"Jerry"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Crazy jerry"
01:10:39;01:10:44;"Crazy jerry as we were walking down market street. We realized we had forgotten an important question"
01:10:44;01:10:49;"We raced back hoping jerry was still there when we entered he was at the front of the store jerry"
01:10:49;01:10:54;"Parker exclaimed first name basis. Jerry silently raised his arms to accept us into a prodigal"
01:10:54;01:11:00;"Son-esque hug. What's your favorite vampire weekend song? I couldn't tell you he replied"
01:11:00;01:11:05;"He told us that they knew they started in new york at columbia, but didn't know any song titles in specific"
01:11:05;01:11:10;"So we plugged grammy award-winning album fotb to jerry greenfield and explained what time crisis was"
01:11:10;01:11:14;"Thanks, parker and grace. This is what it's all about people grassroots"
01:11:14;01:11:18;"word of mouth word of mouth grassroots movement"
01:11:18;01:11:23;"He asked what kind of people you guys were shout out to jerry for being concerned with the moral character of musicians"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"And we told him about your support for bernie and your performance at the iowa caucuses"
01:11:27;01:11:31;"Which it turns out he had heard about after thanking him once again for his time jerry sent us off with words"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"You'll never forget you two have been the highlight of my night"
01:11:34;01:11:39;"Man, that's as good as it gets they say never meet your heroes, but it can work out"
01:11:39;01:11:43;"Sometimes this night was basically a non-stop thrill ride and we haven't even told you the best part"
01:11:43;01:11:49;"In between the americone dream sample and the chunky monkey sample from earlier in the night parker asked an essential question"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"Jerry, do you have a ben and jerry's freezer at home? That's a great question. Here we go"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"He told us that he has an upright fridge in the basement"
01:11:56;01:12:04;"Nice to fridge household where the bottom shelf is a freezer in it in it 40 pints of ben and jerry's at all times epic"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"I mean he's got to"
01:12:06;01:12:12;"At all times all times. That's probably almost every flavor. Well, or like or at least all the classics. Yeah"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"Yeah, I mean if you go over for like a dinner party at jerry greenfield spot"
01:12:15;01:12:20;"And he just pulls out just like plain chocolate. You're just like he's hoping for some chunky monkey, man"
01:12:22;01:12:27;"Oh, hold on. Let me go down to the basement fridge. It's like his wine cellar. Yeah. Yeah"
01:12:27;01:12:33;"He's got his ice cream cellar. Jerry greenfield is living in a two fridge household and in similar vein to lani's dad"
01:12:33;01:12:37;"He's a freezer stock with just one product with that we say goodbye"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"If this ever airs on tc"
01:12:38;01:12:44;"We would like to shout out caroline a student in burlington who introduced us to tc when we were just a couple of vw heads"
01:12:44;01:12:49;"What a long strange trip this email was love parker and grace p.s. Jake and ezra"
01:12:49;01:12:56;"Have you guys heard of bernie's yearning? It is a real b and j's ice cream flavor specifically crafted by ben and released in limited edition"
01:12:56;01:13:02;"During the 2016 election the title may suggest that it's a romance novel or a perfume line yearning by bernie"
01:13:02;01:13:07;"But in reality it is an ice cream chalk full of symbolism about bernie's movement"
01:13:07;01:13:11;"Bernie's yearning includes a chocolate disc at the top of the pint that represents the top one percent"
01:13:11;01:13:15;"You break through the chocolate disc to get mint ice cream, which represents the rest of society"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"I think we did talk about this once my understanding amazing is that"
01:13:19;01:13:24;"Even though I was talking about this a little bit on twitter recently"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"I was saying that ken burns to do a 10-part series on 1980s burlington"
01:13:28;01:13:33;"Because it's pretty amazing to think in the same few years in the same small city all the way up in vermont"
01:13:33;01:13:40;"You got ben and jerry starting bernie sanders becomes mayor and fish starts. There's something in the waters of lake champlain"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"that all those things start at the same time and"
01:13:43;01:13:47;"You know, I bet if you made that case in the 90s people would be like, yeah, so what?"
01:13:47;01:13:51;"Yeah, but now it's 2020. It took 30 years fish is still"
01:13:51;01:13:58;"Selling out shows all over the place still one of the biggest live bands in america act top touring act"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"Bernie could even become president"
01:14:01;01:14:07;"And ben and jerry's they're still opening up new shops. I mean, they changed the ice cream industry. Yeah"
01:14:07;01:14:11;"Three different people and it took yeah 30 plus years"
01:14:12;01:14:17;"For the significance of that heady time in burlington. Yep to go into the mainstream culture of america"
01:14:17;01:14:23;"Yeah, you could crazy even in the 90s when it's like, uh, the 60s in san francisco. Yeah, seriously"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"I think pound for pound that's one of the most influential"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"eras of an american city"

01:15:05;01:15:07;"Freezer"
01:15:33;01:15:39;"Interesting fact that ice cream is not an official ben and jerry's flavor. Yes. See that was my understanding was that"
01:15:39;01:15:43;"They even though ben and jerry are still involved in the company"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"They sold it to like unilever"
01:15:46;01:15:51;"Unilever right or one of some giant company tech owns the majority of it now, right?"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"So I don't think the board would let them do a political"
01:15:55;01:16:01;"Right ice cream, but of course, you know if it's ben and he's even if he's doing it as a solo joint"
01:16:02;01:16:06;"People are gonna understand side project. Yeah, it's more of a side project. But yeah, I don't think"
01:16:06;01:16:13;"I'm sure whatever their corporate overlords now are like you're not putting bernie's yearning in, you know"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"Every safe way in america like you do"

01:16:37;01:16:42;"At the end of the day most people don't actually like that idea. So i'm okay with giving it to trump"
01:16:42;01:16:48;"Yeah, and i'll tell you folks a lot of people they don't want to see grape ice cream some really nasty people"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"They don't want to see you eating grape ice cream. That's why we're gonna make america grape again"

01:17:25;01:17:27;"ice creams they get a royalty"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"and I believe in the case of fish they've"
01:17:30;01:17:36;"Never kept it for themselves as though they've always used it to fund their charitable organization"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"Think about how much like fish food probably millions. Yeah"
01:17:39;01:17:45;"Yeah, so I they've used a lot of that money to I think go towards all sorts of good stuff like helping clean up"
01:17:45;01:17:50;"Lake champlain and things like that local stuff. Yeah, I think local stuff to start and I like that, you know"
01:17:50;01:17:54;"I think they practice what they preach that are good vibes now. I do remember"

01:18:17;01:18:20;"Now we just play to these gigantic crowds, you know"
01:18:21;01:18:26;"Normal questions that all musicians ask but I remember there was a quote that bernie said to somebody"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Like I don't know man"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"Sometimes I think about getting off the road and I remember the second part of it was"
01:18:31;01:18:36;"I could just live off the ice cream man. Oh jerry said that. Yeah, it might have been in the movie"
01:18:36;01:18:39;"It might have been in a book. I read the doc series"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"but there was something about like kind of early 90s jerry just being like"

01:29:24;01:29:26;"Still trapped"
01:29:26;01:29:42;"A hesitant prize fighter"
01:29:42;01:29:46;"Still trapped within my youth"

01:29:49;01:29:52;"Like a songs and lyrics that I like"
01:29:53;01:29:58;"Romances and all strategy leaves me battling with my pride but through the year security some tenderness survives"
01:29:58;01:30:05;"I'm, just another writer still trapped within my truth a hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth"
01:30:05;01:30:10;"I mean, I kind of like it. I'll say it's no, uh, it's no the boxer"
01:30:10;01:30:14;"At times i'd like to break you"
01:30:14;01:30:17;"And drive you to your knees"
01:30:17;01:30:22;"At times i'd like to break through"
01:30:22;01:30:30;"And hold you endlessly it does flirt with that sort of like broadway show tune. Yeah"
01:30:30;01:30:36;"And I know how hard you've tried"
01:30:36;01:30:44;"I've watched while love commands you and i've watched love pass you by"
01:30:44;01:30:48;"At times I think we're drifters"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Still searching"
01:30:52;01:31:00;"Still searching did you guys mention that dan hill is canadian? Wait, he is. Yeah, that's why that's why I know the song"
01:31:00;01:31:04;"So i've never heard this in my life. Oh, this is deep canadian class. That's literally what it is"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"This is canada gold. This is molson gold. Holy"
01:31:06;01:31:11;"I take I take it back guys. I'm sorry influence on brian adams for sure"

01:31:18;01:31:23;"So, you know clearly it did okay down here. All right, but maybe it was more prominent because canada likes to play their own, right?"
01:31:23;01:31:28;"Yeah, that song really grew on me throughout the course of listening to it"
01:31:28;01:31:33;"And now i'm looking through the lyrics the opening you ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"I'd rather hurt you honestly"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Than mislead you with a lie"
01:31:38;01:31:42;"And who am I to judge you in what you say or do i'm only just beginning to see the real you"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"And sometimes when we touch the honesty is too much"
01:31:45;01:31:50;"So he's still trying to figure out how he feels about this person. So she asks him. Do you love me and he's"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"he's like"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Sort of he chokes on his reply. He's like"
01:31:55;01:32:01;"He doesn't know how to express it with words, but then when they touch the depth of his feeling just goes crazy"
01:32:01;01:32:05;"He's a guy who doesn't know how to handle his his big emotions"
01:32:05;01:32:11;"And so she has she has some with words. Well her her love language is uh, verbal. Yeah"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"So she says do I love you and he's like, uh, and he's like listen, babe"
01:32:14;01:32:19;"I might not be good with words, but when you touch me i'm so overwhelmed by emotion"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"The part where it kind of leaves me"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"I I really actually like the beginning and sometimes when we touch the honesty is too much"
01:32:24;01:32:28;"And I have to close my eyes and hide and then I want to hold you till I die"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"This is about the die throws me off there"
01:32:31;01:32:35;"I wanna hold you till I die kind of an easy rhyme"
01:32:35;01:32:40;"Do we both break down and cry? It's like that sounds terrible. Yeah, why does she have to cry too?"
01:32:41;01:32:42;"she"
01:32:42;01:32:46;"We're just like dating right now. Why do we have to hold you till I die?"

01:33:40;01:33:42;"I"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Don't know"
01:33:44;01:33:48;"I can't even say this is a smooth joke, but hearing uh back-to-back canadians"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"maybe"
01:33:49;01:33:53;"Maybe just like kind of imagine some like some throwaway drake line where he's like"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"So something about like shout out"
01:33:56;01:34:01;"Too much"
01:34:01;01:34:09;"I just love the idea drake like little easter eggs for canadians"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Baby, please say something"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"It's a tax cut for every reference"
01:34:13;01:34:19;"Feel like dan hill in 1978"
01:34:19;01:34:30;"Back to 1978. Ooh now we got some actual billy joel. Wow, just the way you are from the stranger classic album"
01:34:30;01:34:35;"Consistent aesthetic here in 78"
01:34:37;01:34:40;"Yeah, everything is some form of sweet ballad"
01:34:40;01:34:45;"God his voice in this is so sweet angelic"
01:34:45;01:34:49;"This album is just a monster"
01:34:49;01:34:55;"This is not even like the top three song on this album track one moving out"
01:34:55;01:35:01;"And I don't see you anymore"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Oh"
01:35:04;01:35:13;"Slightly brazilian feel yeah"
01:35:13;01:35:20;"Please billy. Joel balz remind me of the small cutter. R.i.p. The small cutter. Would you sing this at karaoke at the small cutter?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Yeah, I would do honesty a lot"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Oh, yeah, I remember"
01:35:24;01:35:29;"I remember you sending me a recording of you doing an acoustic cover of honesty"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"That's like a slight weezer vibe"
01:35:32;01:35:37;"Yeah, maybe yeah, because like yeah, honesty like the billy joel. He's like on keyboards like a little jazzy"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"honesty"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Bar chords, yeah like"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"honesty"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Such a lonely word"
01:35:45;01:35:51;"Everyone is so actually I could totally picture rivers singing that. Mm-hmm honesty"
01:35:51;01:35:57;"Mostly what I need from you"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"Oh totally. I want to look it up. I remember dig that up"
01:36:01;01:36:05;"In high school. I can't even remember what the project would have been"
01:36:05;01:36:09;"It might have been something like we were studying shakespeare's sonnets"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"And maybe we had to like rewrite them"
01:36:11;01:36:18;"To like be modern or something a lot of the sonnets the theme is about how beauty fades and I feel like one of them"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"was basically about"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"I guess it's a classic theme to varying degrees of like, uh"
01:36:25;01:36:30;"Meanness like my funny valentine. Mm-hmm. You know, we're basically the whole song is like"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"It's like baby. Don't change a thing"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"about your busted ass"
01:36:34;01:36:35;"face"
01:36:35;01:36:42;"No, no, really i'm okay with the fact that you're awkward and stupid. That's actually what my funny valentine is about"
01:36:42;01:36:47;"Is your figure less than greek is your mouth a little weak?"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"When you open it to speak"
01:36:50;01:36:53;"Are you smart?"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"Dude, you know this song right?"
01:36:56;01:37:01;"Like chet baker does the famous version my funny valentine my funny"
01:37:01;01:37:06;"You know, those are the literal lyrics. I feel like maybe we did this on a really early tc"
01:37:06;01:37:10;"But it's the same. It's like the harsher version of I like I love you just the way you are"
01:37:10;01:37:14;"My funny valentine"
01:37:14;01:37:21;"Oh beautiful singing chet sweet comic valentine"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"I'll skip that"
01:37:23;01:37:34;"It's like the delivery and the vibe of the song is so makes you not think about how harsh it is"
01:37:34;01:37:47;"Your looks are laughable unfotographical"
01:37:47;01:37:51;"Is your figure"
01:37:52;01:37:56;"Less than greek like okay. Not everybody looks like a greek statue"
01:37:56;01:38:08;"Is your mouth a little weak, okay when you open it to speak"
01:38:08;01:38:13;"Are you smart"
01:38:13;01:38:18;"That's just so extra wow"
01:38:18;01:38:23;"I'll throw that on and i'll just it's more of the vibe. Yeah, just vibing out to all wow"
01:38:23;01:38:26;"Just a sexy jazz night pouring some wine"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"with your lover"
01:38:28;01:38:33;"But on this harsh song anyway, billy's a little sweeter. Don't go changing"
01:38:33;01:38:38;"I wonder if I could find this shakespearean sonnet. I'm gonna try to dig up that version of honesty. I sent you"
01:38:38;01:38:42;"Yeah, i'd love to hear that again. If we got any english major listeners"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"tell me which is the"
01:38:45;01:38:49;"Shakespearean sonnet that basically is saying I love you just the way you are even though you're a little"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"got a few problems"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"um back to"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"modern days"
01:38:55;01:39:00;"At number three, we got young boy never broke again. We were talking about young boy never broke again. I don't think so"
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Maybe one of the best names in modern hip-hop. Yeah"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"often referred to as uh"
01:39:07;01:39:11;"Ybnba young boy never broke again. He's got a song called little top"
01:39:25;01:39:29;"A young boy never broken is only 20 years old. He's from baton rouge"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"What's wrong with me?"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"I like that he referred to an invoice taking a page out of beaver's book"
01:40:17;01:40:22;"Yeah, finance is big right now finance clerical accounting"
01:40:22;01:40:29;"Invoice make sure there's a paper trail. See I gotta say I don't know just like I felt like justin beaver"
01:40:29;01:40:34;"Yummy should have been called elated. I think the song should be called invoice. That would have been sick"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"That'd be a tight just like a hit rap song called invoice"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"Or rapper named that would have piqued my interest. Oh, let me"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Actually anything called invoice"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"I mean you could see like kind of like a band rock band called"
01:40:46;01:40:53;"It's it's actually better if it if they have like no sense of humor at all"
01:40:53;01:40:57;"Yeah, just like a post-rock. It's from jazi style band. Yeah invoice"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"What's about pasta? We're invoice"
01:40:59;01:41:08;"Invoice invoice"
01:41:08;01:41:15;"No, a rapper named invoice is tight if we got any rappers out there who's struggling you're good at rapping looking for a name"
01:41:15;01:41:19;"But you're somehow missing like the name and the kind of identity to put it all together"
01:41:19;01:41:25;"But we've got something for you. You're called invoice. Well, it plays on voice an interesting way, too. Yeah"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"invoice"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"That's your ad lib"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"Invoice"
01:41:32;01:41:36;"Anyway, I will manage you. I will bring you in to my company"
01:41:36;01:41:41;"And look a lot of the songs have to be about money. It's a pretty classic theme of hip-hop"
01:41:41;01:41:44;"I'm, not exactly reinventing the wheel here, but your invoice"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Somebody out there is listening"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Hit us up"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Maybe patrick world's gonna step up"

01:42:22;01:42:24;"back to 78"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"clerical themed rap of 2020"

01:43:01;01:43:04;"Yeah, I was getting a little bit of a one of these nights"
01:43:04;01:43:25;"Right there"

01:44:35;01:44:37;"Invoice"
01:44:37;01:45:00;"Solid song on board"
01:45:00;01:45:01;"number two"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"this week"
01:45:03;01:45:07;"Oh, we heard this last time the weekend blinding lights feel like we heard all of these songs last time"
01:45:07;01:45:11;"Yeah, maybe we gotta switch it up because the not just moved at all"
01:45:11;01:45:17;"Maybe it's because we're on apple music rather than itunes now not getting quite the same levels move of movement. Yeah week to week"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"Oh, that's weird"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"Oh, this is like the 80s one"
01:45:23;01:45:31;"This is the weekend's first ever uk number one"
01:45:32;01:45:36;"It's grown on me a little it's hard for me to get over just like that the new way of feel"
01:45:36;01:45:41;"Just that's just not what i'm looking for right now as a listener, but best wishes to everybody who is"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"Congrats guys"
01:45:44;01:45:48;"Maybe just throw that on for a second"
01:45:48;01:45:53;"Hell, yeah, maybe one of the best songs ever written. Did you guys cover this one that one?"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"Take on me. Yeah. No, no, but you covered um, very hard to sing"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"What's the other one in this kind of key that you covered?"
01:46:01;01:46:05;"Everywhere leewood mac. Oh, no the crowded house. Did you do? Oh, yeah, we did crowded house. Yeah"
01:46:05;01:46:15;"Well, it's a hard one to beat yeah hard to beat"
01:46:15;01:46:24;"It's such a well-crafted song"
01:46:24;01:46:29;"I just want to point out that the weekend song is co-written and co-produced by max martin"
01:46:29;01:46:33;"famous and very talented swedish singer and songwriter, but"
01:46:33;01:46:39;"You know as much as the swedes dominate pop music. They haven't produced that many songs as good as"
01:46:39;01:46:47;"Take on me by the norwegian band. Aha. Oh, they're norwegian. Yeah, you think they were swedish? I thought they were english. Oh, no, no"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"very scandinavian"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"and also like, you know"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"a real win for the norwegians"
01:46:53;01:46:59;"Norway's produced some good music for sure, but it's like sweden's got this global reputation if I think norway I think black metal"
01:47:00;01:47:04;"Well, yeah, they famously have the black metal big pop acts out of norway"
01:47:04;01:47:08;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch on the biggest norwegian acts of all time?"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"now"
01:47:10;01:47:14;"Let's get a number crunch brought to you by"
01:47:14;01:47:22;"Seinfeld 2000. It's all death metal. It's all like some edm. It's all aha and then uh, let's see"
01:47:22;01:47:27;"Oh, yeah, royskapp. Yeah, there's some kind of oh post rock. Uh,"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Kygo, oh kygo. Yeah"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"But look from the 80s until kygo"
01:47:32;01:47:39;"Maybe aha was the only group producing truly global hit songs just so people don't think i'm just"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"overstating it. I mean"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"Come on, this is really"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"This is very similar"
01:47:45;01:47:52;"This is more like minor right"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"I think they probably"
01:47:54;01:47:55;"took"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"and then they were like"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"They're like let's make it minor instead of major but it's just ahas has such a better"
01:48:00;01:48:04;"The funny hook thing it kind of ends up sounding like the war on drugs a little bit"
01:48:04;01:48:07;"Oh, yeah, I could see a little bit of war drugs on war on drugs vibe"
01:48:07;01:48:14;"Gang gang gang gang gang gang same tempo"
01:48:14;01:48:24;"Yeah, it's like could have been minor but starts a little minor but this is just such a better synth hook"
01:48:26;01:48:31;"It makes the the weekend synth look seem kind of clunky"
01:48:31;01:48:39;"This song recently broke the billion view mark on youtube. Oh, really? Oh, it's such a classic video. Yeah, is it the one with the drawings?"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"Yeah, yeah"
01:48:42;01:48:49;"It's the second song from the 80s to do that wow, congratulations aha and all of norway"
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Today is another day to find you shine"
01:48:54;01:48:59;"I love this part"
01:48:59;01:49:03;"Just takes you right into the chorus in the perfect way"
01:49:03;01:49:12;"Also"
01:49:12;01:49:15;"Very good looking. Can you picture the guy in the video? Yeah, he's very handsome"
01:49:16;01:49:21;"It's like like a george. Michael vibe. Yeah, you know, it's weird in the 80s good-looking men"
01:49:21;01:49:26;"Were also good songwriters. I don't think it happens as much these days"
01:49:26;01:49:30;"Because I feel like duran duran they wrote their own songs. Sure"
01:49:30;01:49:35;"George, michael george. Michael produced and wrote his own stuff. I mean, honestly bruce"
01:49:35;01:49:39;"Would you say bruce in the 80s was good-looking?"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"Yeah, of course, but bruce"
01:49:42;01:49:47;"Bruce has that underdog flavor like he'll and he might be maybe 85. No, no, but he might be a humble guy"
01:49:47;01:49:52;"but when he talks about ladies, like when he talks about himself in his books and interviews, he's always like"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Was I the best singer out there?"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"far from it"
01:49:56;01:50:02;"Best guitarist I could throw down a lick but I couldn't compete with some of the guys in my neighborhood not even close not even close"
01:50:02;01:50:07;"What I could do I work my ass off to write songs and even when he talks about the 80s. He's like"
01:50:07;01:50:10;"I spent so many hours"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"lifting weights up and down in a pointless rhythm just"
01:50:13;01:50:20;"To build up my arms like he's he might be because he's humble, but he talks about him like getting jacked, right? I'm just saying"
01:50:20;01:50:25;"So, of course bruce is a good-looking guy, but i'm saying george. Michael's like effortlessly"
01:50:25;01:50:32;"Or the vibe he gave off was like effortlessly handsome. George michael is gorgeous. Yeah, wait the guy from uh,"
01:50:32;01:50:35;"morton"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"This is what he looked like at his peak in the 80s"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"He's like he's like a young he's like better looking than rob love"
01:50:41;01:50:46;"Yeah, he kind of has like a patrick swayze vibe. He's like a better looking christian bell. Yeah"
01:50:46;01:50:54;"He's a better looking christian bell they should make a aha movie with christian bale, but use the de-aging technology"
01:50:54;01:50:58;"Just a lot of legwork martin scorsese presents"
01:50:58;01:51:02;"A story that no one wanted take on me"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Christian bill would probably reject the anti-aging technology"
01:51:06;01:51:09;"Right try to do it himself"
01:51:09;01:51:16;"From batman to dick cheney, and I think all the all the guys all the guys take on me"
01:51:16;01:51:18;"All the guys in aha were gorgeous"
01:51:18;01:51:23;"I'm, just saying like wait am I forgetting anybody of like the pop guys just"
01:51:23;01:51:30;"Oh, dude the guy from uh in excess, oh, yeah, he's he's a model. Yeah, totally i'm just thinking of other 80s like"
01:51:31;01:51:37;"Duran Duran's. Oh, yeah, I said duran duran they the fact that duran duran just like all the heads know this but first of all"
01:51:37;01:51:40;"In duran duran, it's like multiple model looking guys"
01:51:40;01:51:44;"And you know, they were kind of back in the day"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"Back in the day. They were like a little bit derided"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"by"
01:51:49;01:51:55;"Like some cool people but like when you actually listen to their music. Yeah, it's funny to think about like some like"
01:51:55;01:52:00;"crusty garage band like the replacements being like look at these pretty boys and then throwing on the record and being like"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Ah, it's pretty good"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"like forward-thinking production"
01:52:05;01:52:10;"Oh damn, yeah, like just doesn't think about like this sounds like mccartney too here. Yeah"
01:52:10;01:52:18;"Is this being english or australian english, okay"
01:52:18;01:52:22;"But it's like oh yeah, this is like the base"
01:52:22;01:52:28;"Like these guys really knew they're like funk and soul music and they're prog and they're"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"deeply into genesis and yes, no doubt"
01:52:31;01:52:37;"Yeah, I can totally picture like just like some midwestern punks to be like, yeah, whatever look at those pretty boys"
01:52:37;01:52:42;"Yeah, they can't play and then just I guess I guess the punks wouldn't care that they could play"
01:52:42;01:52:45;"but they'd just be like their music's not interesting and then like listen to it be like"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"and when the chorus drops"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Actually, dude, it's a pretty good hit hook you gotta admit"
01:52:59;01:53:11;"Robert palmer. Yeah. Yeah sort of they're having a lot of fun on keyboard. He has like a mitt romney vibe"
01:53:11;01:53:18;"No, i'm not big on robert palmer, but wait am I forgetting anybody these days who's a pretty boy"
01:53:18;01:53:22;"Who can write who can write and just sing his ass off does bieber, right?"
01:53:22;01:53:26;"So I don't want to get in trouble here. I think writers in every song. I look here's the thing"
01:53:26;01:53:29;"It's not like a band. I get it on the aha song"
01:53:29;01:53:36;"Take on me the credited writers are I think the three members of the band. What about harry styles? Okay. Here's what i'll say"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Because I respect all pretty boys"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"I don't want anybody"
01:53:41;01:53:50;"I don't want anybody thinking that i'm playing favorites with pretty boys"
01:53:51;01:53:56;"And then i'm saying oh this pretty boy is more of a has a little more musical flavor more of a songwriter"
01:53:56;01:54:00;"I'm equal opportunity all pretty boys are valid"
01:54:00;01:54:03;"I'm, just saying like"
01:54:03;01:54:08;"Okay, you're right. Some people would be like well, what about bieber bieber? I think is talented musically he can sing"
01:54:08;01:54:16;"But he's never sat down if bieber even with two other guys from yeah his where's he from ontario?"
01:54:16;01:54:21;"Yeah, stratford ontario if bieber and two random dudes from growing up in stratford"
01:54:21;01:54:27;"Wrote a song like take on me. I would make the case. I like bieber. He's come close"
01:54:27;01:54:31;"But he hasn't produced a song quite as transcendent as take on me"
01:54:31;01:54:37;"He has like four or five like excellent songs, but even then he's working with like really established"
01:54:37;01:54:40;"Yeah, yeah different model and I know other people would say sean mendes"
01:54:40;01:54:45;"But sean mendes is just starting and he seems like a humble guy. He's very talented"
01:54:45;01:54:50;"Maybe he'll be the guy but he hasn't quite he hasn't produced a take on me yet. You said harry styles"
01:54:50;01:54:56;"Yeah, I mean hannah was blasting that harry styles record around the house for a month or two. There's some tunes"
01:54:56;01:54:59;"Yeah, he's sunflower volume six, right? Right?"
01:54:59;01:55:04;"We've gotten a lot of letters actually asking for the tc take on harry styles and uh, oh, yeah"
01:55:04;01:55:07;"We don't we don't need to have one. We'll do one. Eventually. I'm a fan"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"harry styles deep dive"
01:55:09;01:55:14;"And actually, you know because some people were like, oh you got to get some he's got a song called sunflower, too"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"And some people thought it was vampire weekend-esque"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"I didn't really hear it"
01:55:18;01:55:22;"It was actually pretty beatles-esque. It has this like cool like baroque beatles"
01:55:22;01:55:25;"you"
01:55:25;01:55:29;"I remember thinking the singles off the harry styles"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"Album were the weakest on that record"
01:55:32;01:55:39;"They were the most like sort of down the middle sort of generic pop and then the rest like the deeper cuts on the record"
01:55:39;01:55:44;"Yeah, I remember kind of liking that song was interesting. Yeah, sunflower. I gotta go spend more time with the rest of the record"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"Yeah, now I feel like I painted myself into a corner where i'm kind of"
01:55:47;01:55:53;"Throwing some of today's pretty boys under the bus. They can take it. They can take it"
01:55:53;01:55:57;"And first of all, i'm i'm a fan of all those guys, but it's a different model"
01:55:57;01:56:02;"Those were bands. Those are guys that grew up in the neighborhood in a certain town started a band"
01:56:02;01:56:06;"They were all really attractive. Yeah, and also because here's the thing sean mendes"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"Bieber harry styles, they all are straight up"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"talented musicians and writers"
01:56:11;01:56:15;"I don't want to say that you have to be a great writer. You have to write a song by yourself"
01:56:15;01:56:19;"I feel like i've some of my best records of songwriters been with other people too"
01:56:19;01:56:22;"And I actually I know that I work just as hard"
01:56:22;01:56:27;"You know when I co-write with somebody as when it's by myself, so I don't want to like get into that whole thing"
01:56:27;01:56:33;"But i'll just say like yeah, george. Michael. He starts wham with his buddy from growing up"
01:56:33;01:56:37;"Aha, three guys start a band duran duran bunch of friends"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"What we're not seeing is quite that level of"
01:56:41;01:56:47;"Amateurness in that they were amateurs who came together and then pop transcendence"
01:56:47;01:56:52;"We're not seeing quite that. Yeah, I think i'm going to develop some kind of a ranking system"
01:56:52;01:56:56;"There's three categories, which is songwriting chops"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"pop success"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Looks and looks"
01:57:00;01:57:04;"And I just think in the 80s then diagram the highest score you can get is 30"
01:57:04;01:57:08;"Which is 10 for each one of those I like this and I think in the 80s"
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Is the only time I can think of multiple people who are getting perfect 30s"
01:57:11;01:57:17;"On their pretty boy. It's songwriting chops looks and what uh pop success. Oh pop success"
01:57:17;01:57:22;"Because yeah, I don't want somebody being like well, what about here was this kind of like indie pretty boy"
01:57:22;01:57:28;"He wrote some good tunes and i'll be like, yeah, man that didn't go platinum, right? Yeah, just somebody who's like"
01:57:31;01:57:36;"He's a good looking guy, I think I don't really remember. Yeah, I can't I can't believe I think he is a good looking guy"
01:57:36;01:57:41;"But yeah, okay. No, but here's the thing. These guys are like square jaw straight"
01:57:41;01:57:44;"You know what? I don't even want to use the word pretty boy. We're talking about gorgeous men like models"
01:57:44;01:57:49;"We're talking about model. Conor oberst is not model level. These guys no shots fired at con"
01:57:49;01:57:55;"He's just listening driving around nebraska just like man, whatever"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"No, these guys, you know what? It's fair"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"You pick the best looking guy from durand duran the best looking guy"
01:58:02;01:58:08;"From aha, and then george. Michael you could put on a freaking fashion show. Oh, yeah"
01:58:08;01:58:12;"I think the 80s are also like where the idea of a pretty boy"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"is created"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"I also like that. Right?"
01:58:16;01:58:21;"Yeah, most of the music like all the 90s music was reacting to all these pretty boys"
01:58:21;01:58:26;"Right and now we're like reinterpreting that as like that was actually really cool. Yeah"
01:58:27;01:58:29;"Like kurt cobain looked like"
01:58:29;01:58:34;"Well, kurt cobain is low-key. Very handsome. Maybe not that low. They deliberately were like"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"right"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"mtv is creating a"
01:58:38;01:58:42;"Direct. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah vehicle"
01:58:42;01:58:47;"And I think there's a lot of anger from the less pretty 70s stars who are just like what about me?"
01:58:47;01:58:54;"No, but look kurt kurt cobain and nd vetter. They're both pretty boys. First of all, we have to differentiate here. Um,"
01:58:55;01:58:58;"Because vetter's not a pretty boy. He's a pretty boy"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"Interesting. He dressed it down"
01:59:01;01:59:05;"He dressed it down because he didn't want to be like he's more rugged the guys we're talking about"
01:59:05;01:59:09;"You have your cuties gavin rossdale. Oh, yeah, that's a pretty boy"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"That's funny. I had this whole if he if he was in a band in the 80s"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"He would have looked he would have fit right into durand duran"
01:59:14;01:59:19;"Look, you got your cuties. You got your pretty boys and then you have your just gorgeous men"
01:59:19;01:59:24;"We're talking about gorgeous men here greek gods and also by the way, we're not saying that this"
01:59:24;01:59:28;"I'm, just talking about by a certain kind of fashion magazine standard of strikingness"
01:59:28;01:59:31;"You know, right, right, right. There's all sorts of cuties and pretty boys"
01:59:31;01:59:38;"These guys are just and also again, it's these guys are scoring a 30 on on the act. It's just out of control"
01:59:38;01:59:45;"I love this metric, but I would still say even within this system the ultimate achievement of pretty boy"
01:59:45;01:59:51;"Because here's the thing who's a really hot male model now who's the epitome of good-lookingness now?"
01:59:51;01:59:58;"What about that? Uh that convict guy who blew up on instagram? Oh, yeah, jeremy jeremy meeks jeremy meeks"
01:59:58;02:00:01;"So this would be yeah, he was kind of like a notable"
02:00:01;02:00:08;"Striking gorgeous man of our era. So you got to understand like this would be like if jeremy meeks"
02:00:08;02:00:11;"wrote and produced"
02:00:11;02:00:19;"What's like the take on me of our era despacito this would be like if jeremy makes wrote and produced despacito by himself"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"and"
02:00:22;02:00:26;"You're just like what's the story with this guy and you're just like, you know, he was just like a local songwriter"
02:00:26;02:00:29;"He's from a he's from a small town in texas"
02:00:29;02:00:33;"And he just wrote and produced despacito and like and then it became the biggest song ever"
02:00:33;02:00:37;"I know i'm going a little bit back and forth between gorgeous men pretty boys, whatever"
02:00:37;02:00:42;"But as far as the pretty boy act when everything comes together"
02:00:42;02:00:47;"I want to know if you can come tell me a song that was written by the singer"
02:00:48;02:00:56;"And perhaps they're friends from the neighborhood. I think that take on me by aha in terms of looks pop success and writing"
02:00:56;02:01:00;"Is the gold standard 30 for 30 is 30 for 30"
02:01:00;02:01:06;"Maybe it gets bonus points, too. I don't think anything beats that in terms of being like the song is incredible"
02:01:06;02:01:10;"The song is iconic and a huge success and then you see"
02:01:10;02:01:15;"The people who wrote it or at least the one of the main singer and they're stunning and they're just stunning"
02:01:16;02:01:21;"If anybody can beat that i'm putting my cards down on the table and saying that take on me by aha is the ultimate"
02:01:21;02:01:24;"pretty boy pop success"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"Anyway, I love that that was"
02:01:26;02:01:32;"Where are we? I love that that wasn't even on the well that came out of the weekend somehow. Yeah number one 1978"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"You're not gonna believe this"
02:01:34;02:01:37;"It's the bg's. Oh my god. Hell of a family"
02:01:37;02:01:44;"You know, I was talking about recently, you know when you do um, uh cpr class they tell you um"
02:01:45;02:01:51;"That the way to remember the tempo to push on somebody's chest is staying alive really seems fast"
02:01:51;02:01:55;"This is standard like i've taken classes not that long ago and they talk about this"
02:01:55;02:02:00;"But I have an issue is that and look I think there's some other sons. I think they said maybe like"
02:02:00;02:02:06;"Maybe mrs. Robinson is the same tempo, but I have a problem is that thank god knock on wood"
02:02:06;02:02:11;"I've never had to do anything. And by the way, it's always worth checking this stuff out"
02:02:11;02:02:17;"They say these days they put a little more emphasis on the pushing rather than the blowing in the mouth. Okay"
02:02:17;02:02:19;"People are more like just keep that heart moving. Hmm"
02:02:19;02:02:23;"I've heard people say like yeah, some people get too hung up on like the oh"
02:02:23;02:02:27;"Am I gonna put my lips on the just like just push on that heart and you got to push hard, too"
02:02:27;02:02:33;"It's it's never taken a cpr. You never pushed on the dummy or anything never had the occasion to take a cpr class"
02:02:33;02:02:39;"It's a decent skill to have and look. Yeah, the main thing they said is like if you don't remember anything just"
02:02:39;02:02:44;"You call call 911 put your phone on speaker put it down and just start pushing on the sternum"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"And you're literally singing staying alive"
02:02:46;02:02:50;"Well, but I have this issue is that for some reason I can picture staying alive"
02:02:50;02:02:55;"I don't know if there's like some rap song that samples it I can very easily picture it at two different tempos"
02:02:55;02:02:58;"like for some reason I can picture like this kind of slow version that's like"
02:02:58;02:03:09;"I can picture like the chopped and screwed version somehow, but it's obviously it's fucked up because you guys are arguing over this"
02:03:09;02:03:15;"While someone's just dying in front of them. It sounds like a badass and i'll sketch just like not like a badass and i'll 90s"
02:03:15;02:03:17;"It's like no, no, no, it's"
02:03:17;02:03:24;"It's"
02:03:24;02:03:28;"It's the mark of a good song and kind of it just kind of sits at any tempo"
02:03:28;02:03:31;"But yeah, so that's what's messed up is when you hear it and sounds fast"
02:03:31;02:03:35;"That means this is not the song you should be using to get the tempo for"
02:03:36;02:03:39;"For pushing on somebody's chest. Maybe they're just using it because it's a"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"a pun"
02:03:41;02:03:44;"I guess it's the right tempo people try staying alive. I mean"
02:03:44;02:03:52;"It's faster than it's fast"
02:03:52;02:03:56;"But it's not fast for saving my heartbeat faster than my resting heartbeat"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"But I don't know anything about cpr"
02:03:59;02:04:04;"Okay, maybe there's some i'm looking at an article about songs to do cpr to"
02:04:04;02:04:11;"The new york presbyterian hospital collects songs that have a tempo between 100 and 120 beats per minute. So that's pretty wide margin"
02:04:11;02:04:14;"You could also do girls just want to have fun"
02:04:14;02:04:21;"Oh, wow, right. So it's not like some guitar hero thing where it's like it's like you're dropping two bpm. Oh"
02:04:21;02:04:28;"Yeah, I guess they just want to like probably remind people that it's like you're all freaked out don't be going like"
02:04:28;02:04:32;"And don't be going like"
02:04:32;02:04:37;"It's like it's not black sabbath, right? It's a little faster"
02:04:37;02:04:48;"The number one song still on apple music this guy's just killing it roddy rich the box"
02:04:48;02:04:50;"So"
02:04:50;02:05:07;"All right, I gotta go"
02:05:07;02:05:12;"That was this week's time crisis. We'll see you next time. Thanks for that subject. I gotta bounce"
02:05:12;02:05:16;"time crisis with"
